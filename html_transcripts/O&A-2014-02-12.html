<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a pre-show hosted by Sam Roberts, featuring calls about Bobo's sexual performance and discussions of Jim Norton's surprisingly positive reactions to 90 Day Fiancé and a school's Valentine's Day card policy, contrasting with his usual bluntness, especially regarding shows like My 600-lb Life.  Listeners called in to discuss 90 Day Fiancé and TLC programming further, alongside tension between Opie and E-Rock over "line of the day" selections.  The Olympics were discussed, including Bob Costas's eye infection, class disparity in winter sports, and Ant's reaction to a gold medalist's brother with cerebral palsy.  Other topics included the NutriBullet, a 74-stone woman accused of murder, and previews for Farrah Abraham's second sex tape and Billy Ray Cyrus's "Achy Breaky 2."  Time Warner Cable and Fios internet service issues, particularly affecting Netflix streaming, concluded the pre-show, punctuated by frequent offensive language and graphic discussions.

The main show started with a continuation of the discussion on internet service providers, specifically Netflix streaming quality problems with Fios.  The hosts and a caller then engaged in explicit commentary on the attractiveness of female Olympic athletes, particularly curlers and figure skaters, with detailed descriptions of their bodies.  Tom Brokaw's cancer diagnosis sparked a conversation about mortality and age, followed by commentary on Chris Christie and the George Washington Bridge lane closures, and general disapproval of politicians, including President Obama. A detailed review of Billy Ray Cyrus's "Achy Breaky 2" and its music video followed, along with discussion of Julia Roberts's half-sister's suicide and her critical suicide note.  The segment concluded with advertisements and informal chatter.

The next segment featured a listener's story about her strained relationship with her sister due to weight issues, followed by a comedic and crude critique of AskMen.com's "99 Most Desirable Women of 2014" list, with sexually suggestive remarks and digressions about various celebrities.  Bruce Jenner's gender transition was briefly mentioned.  The hosts debated the list's validity.

A series of commercials for various products and services, including debt relief, dating websites, Vermont Teddy Bears, adult products, and more, interspersed with calls and discussions followed.  A catastrophic ice storm in Atlanta was debated, with calls from Georgia residents sharing experiences.  A caller from Shanghai discussed his work bringing bands to China and cultural differences in comedy. The Westminster Dog Show was discussed, along with a listener's story about dog shows and a story about a model stealing a puppy in Shanghai, leading to a discussion on cultural differences regarding dog consumption in China.  A listener shared a story about a giraffe being killed in a zoo.  A bizarre message from Gary Busey and a sexually suggestive Valentine's Day message from a caller concluded this segment.  Jimmy Norton's cloning on another show was briefly mentioned.


The show continued with a gruesome anecdote about a zoo's plan to euthanize giraffes, leading to a discussion of American attitudes towards animal welfare.  A caller shared a bizarre encounter attempting to buy a novelty sex watch in Shanghai. One host recounted his brother's experiences in a Chinese tavern with teenage girls, prompting a discussion about their experiences in Asia, including encounters with prostitutes and the strict laws of Singapore and the Philippines.  This transitioned into a discussion of *Locked Up Abroad*, focusing on different types of people featured on the show and a detailed anecdote about a prison escape.  Brother Joe called in, recounting his near-detainment in El Salvador and a positive experience in Abu Dhabi.  Numerous advertisements were interspersed with discussions of Jesse Joyce's negative experiences with online hate mail, a joke about crack pipe vending machines, and Jesse Joyce’s past DUIs and subsequent Canadian border issues.  Anecdotes about police encounters concluded the segment.

The final segment featured comedian Jesse Joyce as a guest.  They discussed Joyce's bizarre encounters with police, stemming from sexually suggestive behavior by an officer on the Pennsylvania Turnpike, and a subsequent incident involving another comedian, Jeremy Schachter.  The conversation included a story about Joyce's jacket being stolen by Brutus "The Barber" Beefcake after a chaotic roast in Toronto, featuring a fight and unruly attendees.  Numerous commercials ran throughout.  The Iron Sheik urinating in the studio was mentioned.  The segment ended with a discussion about Joyce potentially writing a book about his experiences.

Gum and mints, well, they just cover it up.  Use Smart Mouth in the morning for great breath all day.  Rinse in the evening for clean, kissable breath all night. 
[00:00:30]  You can even wake up without morning breath.  Smart Mouth, for 12 hours of real clean breath,  look for the green box at your favorite store.  In 30 minutes, broadcasting's finest duo will hit the airwaves  and prepare for the incomparable O.P. and Anthony show.  Only a show this big could have a pre-show this good.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony pre-show with Sam Roberts.  Welcome and good morning. 
[00:01:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony pre-show highlighting everything,  getting excited for everything that may be coming today  on the O.P. and Anthony show in under 30 minutes.  My name is Sam Roberts.  Not only will we be getting amped up  for everything O.P. and Anthony and little Jimmy Norton  are going to get into on today's show,  but we'll also be highlighting what happened yesterday.  If you want to be a part of it, 
[00:01:30]  866-WOW1-WOW, 866-969-1969.  This song is better than jock jams.  I don't know what could get you this pumped up.  Ah, I know what could get you this pumped up.  The thought of another O.P. and Anthony show  going down in just a few minutes,  live here on a Wednesday morning.  And a lot to get into today.  Of course, the Olympics continuing.  There's an article in the Post today,  Philip Seymour Hoffman's diary exposed.  I don't know why when a person dies, 
[00:02:00]  everybody's like,  okay, now we can read their diary  and post it in the newspaper.  Why do famous people even have diaries anymore?  Nothing good can come of it.  Once you're out of high school  and you're not a girl,  you should realize that nothing good  is going to come of diaries.  Don't write down the things  you're feeling vulnerable about  because eventually you'll be dead,  especially if you're addicted to heroin,  and somebody will read your diary  and publish it in the newspaper.  I don't know.  So I'm sure O&A will get into it today. 
[00:02:30]  Let's go right to Larry in Tennessee.  Larry?  Hi, Sam.  Good morning.  You seem very subdued, Larry.  Well, I drove till 3 o'clock in the morning, Sam.  I stayed awake to call  as a request from Lady Trucker.  And for Lady Trucker,  Hollywood, prime time,  Sammy Sweetheart,  D.F.N. Roberts,  professional broadcaster,  world-renowned professional listening expert  and originator of the blatantly stolen  Lonely Virgil concert. 
[00:03:00]  Sam,  to hark back to the super show,  I think it's a bad thing  to try to compare Bobo to real men.  Why is that?  Because for Bobo to reach two messes,  it's going to take, what,  two, three hundred blood cells?  Yeah, that's true.  That's true.  I mean, Bobo always gets credit  for becoming a wreck so fast.  We heard that on Friday's super show.  I hope and Anthony comment about it all the time.  They go,  look at it.  You talk to him about women, 
[00:03:30]  he becomes fully engorged.  You talk to him about sports,  he's no longer a wreck.  But Larry brings up a great point.  His penis is so small,  it takes very little blood to fill it up.  Yes, I think that's where,  that ends the fast response,  both up and down,  because so little blood actually has to move.  I'm glad somebody finally brought that up.  Larry, it's wonderful to hear your voice again on the show.  I'm glad you're not listening to the haters.  Go get some rest, buddy.  Sammy, I've got to stay up to listen to you now,  you know that. 
[00:04:00]  I know, Larry.  Who could sleep with this going on?  It's so exciting.  I'll talk to you later, buddy.  See you, buddy.  And if you're excited about today's show,  I mean, if yesterday's show  is any indication  of how great today's show is going to be,  holy Toledo,  are we in for a treat.  I have to tell you,  I don't know what's going on with Jim Norton lately.  Yesterday on the pre-show,  we were playing,  or earlier this week,  whenever it was,  we were playing some of his clips  talking about 90 Day Fiance 
[00:04:30]  and the fact that we're all watching this show  because of what a train wreck it is  and to make fun of the guys on it  and to talk about how bad it's going to be  when all these women leave the guys  and what saps they are  and how we can relate to them.  Jim takes the totally other route  and he starts talking about how likable everyone is on the show  and how he thinks that everybody's going to find love.  I don't know if this is something, 
[00:05:00]  if this is a bit that Jim's working on.  I don't know if it's a character,  but I don't think so.  I think we are witnessing a personal change  and growth in the life of little Jimmy Norton.  I think we're watching him evolve as a person right in front of us  and that's the benefit of doing a radio show every day  that's as honest as the Opie and Anthony show.  If you start analyzing what's going on,  you can see the evolution that some of our heroes, 
[00:05:30]  our radio heroes go through.  So after Jim took that opinion on 90 Day Fiance,  yesterday Opie brings up a story  that somebody tweeted him a photo of a letter  that went out to the school that his kid goes to  that said this person's kid goes to  and the person's kid's school  said that the children were not allowed  to bring in Valentine's Day cards  unless they brought in enough cards 
[00:06:00]  for the entire class  and they had no names on the envelopes.  So everybody got the exact same Valentine's Day card  and everybody got one.  Now I thought this was a no-brainer.  Everybody in the room is going to be like,  what the fuck is going on?  That's crazy.  And Opie and Anthony felt that way.  But Jim surprised us all  by taking it in another direction.  Let's play track six, Sal.  They don't want you making maybe a little special one  for someone else.  Like if you do like somebody. 
[00:06:30]  Right, you might put an extra...  I like that girl.  You might put a heart or something.  Yes, yes.  They don't want you doing that.  So it's random.  You just sign the fucking card  and they grab them up?  Well, the reason is this will make it easier  for the children to pass out the cards themselves.  How about they know the kids' names  and you hand them out that way?  And stop with the bullshitting.  It's making it easier.  Now you're just flat out lying.  Why don't you just say what that really is about?  They will give one to each person in their class.  If your child chooses to exchange Valentine's cards in school, 
[00:07:00]  he or she should have one for each classmate.  This will avoid hurt feelings.  Hurt feelings?  Please wait until Friday, February 14th.  Can you believe that, though?  But nothing is...  There's no individuals.  You can't be an individual.  You can't have a one-on-one kind of...  Jimmy!  ...building thing.  Look at Jimmy's face.  I have mixed feelings on it.  Oh.  But the hurt feelings thing is part of life.  You're going to get hurt  after you're out of the protection of a school system.  I agree.  You're right.  And I agree, and I hate the mentality of, 
[00:07:30]  this way it will be easier.  Yeah.  The reality is,  no one who picks up a gun  and walks through a school shooting  is one of the popular kids.  And Jim went in from there  to talk about the fact that this might be a good thing,  and that he kind of supported the idea  of everybody getting a Valentine's Day card,  which I was left flabbergasted.  Because I disagree,  and I could have sworn  that Norton was going to disagree. 
[00:08:00]  But he's softening a little.  And he even said in his argument  that as time goes on,  people soften.  And as much as, you know,  we're not as tough  as the World War II generation,  they're not as tough  as the World War I generation,  and nobody's as tough as the Vikings.  So Jim's argument was,  maybe as human evolution goes,  the softening is not a bad thing,  which is very surprising,  but also, you know, refreshing.  To see something like that happen. 
[00:08:30]  Now, let's not get too carried away.  Let's not start to think  that Jim Norton is an entirely different person  that we're not prepared to deal with.  Because later on in the show,  we were playing clips from the show,  My 600-lb Life.  And the woman,  she's 600 pounds,  she refuses to lose any weight,  she can't get out of bed,  she's living on disability,  and eating dumplings.  So let's go to track 11.  And this is what Norton had to say about that.  He's a waste.  You fucking waste. 
[00:09:00]  Stop going in there and feeding a monster.  She can't get out of bed.  So obviously she cannot feed herself.  What character?  So everything she eats,  he has to bring over to her.  So just bring her,  and if she would,  no, I need my,  no, here's what you eat.  Right.  This is what the doctor said,  that's all you get.  But I need my dumplings.  Oh, she loves her dumplings.  She's a big, fat, selfish fuckwad.  Yeah, she really is.  It's like,  I understand it's an addiction,  and it's a hard one,  but when you're making the conscious decision,  Yes.  to eat dumplings instead of salad, 
[00:09:30]  go fuck yourself.  Disability.  Go fuck yourself.  Fat people on disability is infuriating.  Yeah, it is.  Fucking infuriating, you pig.  It kind of is.  Get off it.  And then Jim went even further,  so this is how we know that Jim has not,  the Jim that we know and love  has not completely departed.  Jim went even further  to talk about enablers.  Let's go to track 13.  Tell me why that part of it is a disease.  Also her fucking,  it's a weird disease 
[00:10:00]  because the choice does go into it.  Like the idea is  you do make certain decisions,  and that's the fucking tricky part of it,  and that's a decision she could make,  and she's choosing not to make that decision.  Yeah, she's a selfish pig is what she is.  And her fucking husband is a disgusting,  groveling enabler.  Every fucking drunk has enablers.  Every drug addict has enablers.  Every fat fuck has enablers.  Don't leave me! 
[00:10:30]  The addict is bad enough  and pathetic enough  and selfish enough,  but 50, not 50,  but a percentage of it  is the fucking enabler  who just can't stop helping.  Here you go!  Don't kill it, he wins!  This show is so schitzel.  I love it.  What happened to sympathy, Jimmy?  I have sympathy.  What happened to sympathy, Jimmy?  Realistic sympathy.  Right.  Realistic.  I'm not a...  No, no, no, but I mean,  I don't want to be inconsistent.  I don't really need an answer. 
[00:11:00]  It's like,  there's a difference between sympathy  and empathy and doormat.  Right.  And like,  I empathize with a fat person like that  because it's a brutal addiction.  Right.  And if she's trying,  I'm behind her,  and I support her.  You don't see the trying part.  There's no fucking trying.  You got people putting their finances.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, people are paying money.  Towards you getting better.  The least you could do  is fucking go,  oh, fuck,  I'll suffer through  a grilled chicken sandwich  this one time.  And groveling enabler,  if he had argued with her  and said, 
[00:11:30]  you're trying to get better,  have grilled chicken.  Yeah, get used to it.  And then she actually  overrode him and said,  what are you going to do,  punch her in the face?  He couldn't quickly enough  go,  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Don't leave me.  Don't leave me.  Don't leave me.  Don't leave me.  So it's not,  it's not like he's  completely departed.  And I love that.  Love it.  Let's go to the phones.  866.  866-WOW1-WOW  866-969-1969  And we start  with Alex in Tennessee.  Alex,  welcome to the pre-show. 
[00:12:00]  It's Alex,  like Baldwin,  except I'm not  a complete jackass.  Okay, good to know.  But,  two things.  First,  about 90 Day Fiance.  Yeah.  I know Jimmy  has a big tell  when he's acting  in that he looks  like a little cheeky boy.  Mm-hmm.  But could this  possibly be  the one thing  he could act about  and he's actually  doing this whole thing  as a bit?  If he's doing this  as a bit,  this has moved on  from acting  and has become  performance art.  Because, 
[00:12:30]  I mean,  I always have  the cheeky meter on.  I'm watching  Jim Norton  like a hawk  waiting for that  cheeky boy  to come out of his shell.  and I have not  seen it.  Yeah,  and one other thing  about my 600-pound life,  I want to congratulate you.  That was the first time  I actually puked  from a piece of audio.  Just hearing her?  When she talked about,  I can actually reach  my vagina  and clean it myself. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, dear Christ.  That was so disgusting.  Thanks, buddy.  Alec,  when you're going  through clips  and you're watching  a TV show for clips  and you hear  a big fat woman  argue that she knows  she's lost weight  because I can reach  my own vagina  and clean it  and I couldn't do  that before.  That's what's  commonly referred to  as gold  in our business.  Peter on Long Island.  Good morning.  Next big thing,  Sam Roberts.  How are you, Peter?  Oh, life is 
[00:13:30]  freaking delightful.  Awesome.  Listen,  you guys are falling  into a trap  but I think  you're even aware  of it.  TLC,  that's what they do.  They put up  one or two shows  that are almost reasonable  and they get you  to watch those commercials.  I don't normally  believe in the  slippery slope fallacy  but, man,  you guys are starting  to go all in  on TLC.  Oh, what do you mean?  So they put up  one show that's worth  watching and then  you start watching  commercials and you  end up watching  all the crappy  reality shows  on the entire network? 
[00:14:00]  Yes.  I mean, look,  I'm not going to  argue with you  because I found  myself yesterday  watching Extreme  Couponing  and I'm wondering  what's happening  to my life.  I started all  because of you guys.  I started watching  the Keerleum  and Pow show  and before I knew it  I was like,  oh no,  I know they're going  to start watching  my 600 pound  whatever  and here you go.  You do,  it is.  You're right,  buddy.  Thanks,  Peter.  It is a slippery slope.  He's right.  Tony in Brooklyn.  What's up,  Tony?  I love the Mohawk  skullet that's 
[00:14:30]  going on there.  That thing is  tremendous.  That 90-day  fiance.  That thing is  unbelievable.  Oh, Sammy,  one more thing.  Yeah.  I got two tickets  to Patrice.  Come look for  Tony from Brooklyn  on Twitter.  Oh, all right.  Tony from Brooklyn.  You're giving him  away?  You know what?  I am giving him  away for a certain  price.  Oh, get out of  here.  You can't scalp  tickets to a benefit.  Andrew on Long  Island.  Good morning,  professional  broadcaster Sam  Roberts.  How are you? 
[00:15:00]  Good morning,  Andrew.  I wanted to know  if there was maybe  a little bit of  tension around the  office over the  past couple of  days.  It seems that on  the post show,  E-Rock has chosen  specific clips of  the day that may  have mushroom-stamped  Opie.  Yeah.  That's a good  call.  Let me play the  clip.  Thanks, Andrew.  Yesterday, so two  days ago for line  of the day,  E-Rock chooses a  clip because E-Rock's  been choosing line  of the day for the  last two days on the  post show. 
[00:15:30]  E-Rock chooses a  clip that is Opie  saying, I don't want  to share dudes with  my chick.  It was a slip of the  tongue and it was  embarrassing.  Yesterday, yeah,  oh, and is that it?  Yeah, I have the  share.  All right, so this  was Monday's line of  the day.  And we had a good  time and then I was  just like, oh, that's  over, obviously, because  as soon as I leave, giant  basketball sneaker guys  coming around again.  Yep.  I'm like, I ain't  sharing a dude with my  chick.  You said that wrong. 
[00:16:00]  So that becomes Monday's  line of the day.  Yesterday's line of the  day was this.  Let's go to track eight.  This was in reference to  the news anchor that we  played on yesterday's show  calling or referring to  Samuel L. Jackson by  Lawrence Fishburne's  credits.  Lawrence Fishburne, is he  going to be in RoboCop? 
[00:16:30]  I guess he's in RoboCop  or Samuel Jackson.  So you're doing the  same thing that the  newscaster did.  Whoa.  But.  Oh, my God.  I think I just did.  Yeah.  But I'm saying the  Lawrence.  Yeah.  Whatever.  I'm trying to explain  it.  Of course, it's.  No, motherfucker.  Would you say so?  It's not a line.  It's just a flub.  Yeah.  E-Rock the last two days  has been picking Opie  flubs for line of the  day.  And I really.  I mean, now that we've  addressed it, maybe Opie  will bring it up today. 
[00:17:00]  I don't know for sure.  I hope so.  Because if I'm Opie, I  want to know why.  Why do you keep doing  that?  Why?  Why go out of your way to  make me look like a fool?  I don't understand it  because it's not line of the  day is just the best joke  of the day.  But E-Rock's like, look, I  got the power now.  I don't know.  E-Rock had a problem with  Opie, but I'd really love to  get into that later today on  the Opie and Anthony  show starts in under 14  minutes.  That's very exciting.  Speaking of the Lawrence  Fishburne news anchor clip,  I did want to play this.  They were disgusted. 
[00:17:30]  So a news anchor asks  Samuel L. Jackson about  his Super Bowl commercial.  Samuel L. Jackson calls  him out and says, that was  Lawrence Fishburne.  That is not me.  So he makes a whole joke  about it.  He berates the guy for like  two and a half full minutes.  At that point, I think it's  been cleared.  I made a mistake.  The news anchor has to get  back on TV and apologize.  And this is what Opie and  Anthony thought of that 
[00:18:00]  news anchor after going  through the humiliation,  having to apologize for his  flub.  Good live TV moment, but for  it to end with an apology.  Yeah.  So now it's don't mix a person  up with someone else or you'll  be misconstrued as racist.  I could even see apologizing  to Samuel L. Jackson like  that because it happened at  all.  That's all.  Yeah, exactly.  He's an A-list celebrity.  That's fine.  But then to say, and anyone  else who was offended, who  else would be offended that  you mistake someone for  someone else? 
[00:18:30]  There's, it's preposterous.  I agree.  That's where we're at.  Because the black guy was  mistaken for another black  guy.  First of all, you can mistake  white people for other  white people.  It's very hard to mistake  white people for other  black people or vice versa.  So when that happens, it's  OK, I don't get this.  We are just so fucking  doomed.  I love what Ant just kind of  gives up.  And when Ant gets angry, we'll  go to the phones in just a  minute.  But that Ant clip reminded me  of another moment from 
[00:19:00]  yesterday's show.  Sometimes Ant just decides  that he's in a rage.  Let's go to track 10.  We started bringing up mom  and pop shops.  I think this was just in  reference to coffee.  And I guess Ant has a  problem with mom and pop  shops, too.  Let's listen to this.  You're going against  America, my my friend.  Nah, that's one of the  reasons why this country's  fucked up.  Yeah, I don't know.  Kicking all the mom and  pops out of their stores.  That's bullshit.  Mom and pop.  I used to like the local  hardware store. 
[00:19:30]  I don't think they even  were a mom and pop where  they knew your name when  you were.  Oh, yeah.  Damn it.  I like a good Walmart.  It's cheaper.  Well, it's overrated.  Low your prices.  Mom and pop.  Cobbler.  Are you going to go get  your shoes repaired at the  Cobbler?  Exactly.  Or are you just going to  go to some fucking nice  like fucking Walmart and  buy new shoes?  Exactly.  Gives a shit.  Hey, could you hammer on  a new hammer on a new  heel?  Yeah.  No.  Yeah, that's what I need.  A new heel. 
[00:20:00]  Fuck that.  It's good, I think.  Oh.  What is he so upset about?  Sometimes people do need  heels on their shoes.  866-WOW1-WOW.  866-969-1969.  Let's go down the line and  start with Josh in New  Hampshire.  What's up, Josh?  Sammy!  How you doing, buddy?  Can I get a time check?  It's just about 20 minutes  after the hour, only 10  minutes before Opie and  Anthony begin. 
[00:20:30]  Peace.  Thanks, buddy.  How about Joe in Detroit?  Hey, what's up?  I just wanted to comment on  the Valentine's Day thing.  Yeah.  Is that really a  controversy?  I mean, I don't...  I grew up in Detroit, and  I mean, that was like a  customary thing, just to  give Valentine's to  everyone, so I don't see  the big deal.  Well, I think the big deal  is that you're forced to  give Valentine's to  everybody, meaning that if 
[00:21:00]  there's a girl in your  class that you like, you  can't just bring in a  Valentine and give it to  the girl.  It's a matter of making  sure that everybody feels  equal, and everybody feels  properly taken care of.  And it's like, I think  Opie and Anthony's point  was that it's symptomatic  of taking away  individuality.  Right.  I mean, I'm 24, but it  was basically like, I  don't know what my  parents went through or  anything as far as being  forced, but it seems like  that was like a custom  here in Detroit, or at 
[00:21:30]  least that's what I went  through.  Did it make you feel  better?  Oh, yeah.  I felt great.  Yeah, I bet you did.  Thanks, Joe.  Frank in Brooklyn.  Jimmy.  What's up, buddy?  So, you know, I was  thinking that how Jimmy  goes from, you know,  caring and the other, and  then going flip-flopping,  and, you know, sometimes  Anthony's just giving up.  I think that's what makes  the show great.  If you've got three  different guys, you never  know what you're going to  get from Opie. 
[00:22:00]  He's ready to just scream  and yell, but that's what  makes the show so good,  Sammy.  That's why you have a  pre-show.  I think you're right.  I mean, yesterday, Jim  unexpectedly taking the  side of, you know what,  maybe it's going to help  the kids, completely made  that into an awesome break.  Like, it turned it into  great radio, and just the  idea of Ant out of the  blue, deciding that he  hates mom-and-pop shops.  You're right.  That's why this show is so  good.  And he said something 
[00:22:30]  about mistaking, you know,  the black guy for a black  guy.  You know, Anthony gets  mistaken for Hitler all the  time, but they don't look  alike.  True.  Yeah, that's more of what  they say.  They have similar points of  view.  Thanks, buddy.  We were talking about  the Olympics, too.  The Olympics are ongoing,  and I'm sure that they're  going to get into more  Olympic stuff today.  Bob Costas,  has been taken off  television because his  eyes are too unsightly for  everybody to look at.  I guess his pink eye is now  spreading across his entire  face, so Matt Lauer is  replacing him.  But we started talking 
[00:23:00]  about the Olympics  yesterday, and Opie brought  up a good point about the  Olympics.  Let's play track three.  But I did watch the  Olympics a little bit.  A lot of those sports are  for privileged people.  You think?  Were you able to grow up  and do this as a casual  sport?  No.  Were you allowed to go  speed skating?  No.  Or do curling?  No.  I mean, most of us, you  know, if you lived in a 
[00:23:30]  colder climate, you got to  ski a little bit, but that's  about it.  Yeah.  I guess with the Summer  Olympics, for the most part,  if you could run fast, you'll  do pretty good.  Summer Olympics, you can  relate to it because you did  a lot of those sports.  You're kind of growing up and  just fooling around your  backyard or whatever.  But winter sports, that's  for rich people.  You had to have money to do  most of these sports, don't  you think?  We had a curling team in my  high school, but I was  never a part of it.  You had a curling team?  No.  Oh, wow.  There you go.  That was good.  That was good.  So you got to do it quick.  I had to realize that because 
[00:24:00]  I was going to, that was  good.  That wouldn't have lasted.  That right there is a prime  example.  When Jim says something that  seems outlandish, you got to  pause for a moment, wait for  him to start looking cheeky, and  then you realize that he's  lying.  But Opie was right.  The thing about the Winter  Olympics is that all of these  games and all these events are  things that nobody did growing  up.  Like, nobody was in their  backyard curling.  There was no curling day at the  ice skating rink.  It's just, you wonder who, and 
[00:24:30]  I guess it's the very wealthy,  grow up playing these games.  Ant showed his sensitivity  yesterday.  Let's play track four.  This is the guy who won the  gold medal, who I guess has a  younger brother with, I think  it's cerebral palsy.  I'm not sure, but Ant showed  his undying sensitivity for it in  this clip.  He wins, and they show his  brother, Frederick.  And he's cheering, of course.  Right.  They keep the camera on him a 
[00:25:00]  little too long every time,  because he has just shit  flying out of his mouth.  His whole shin was wet.  He was literally drooling.  I know, I understand it's an  illness.  The CP.  I understand.  But his parents are right  there.  Right.  You know the TV cameras are on  you.  Right.  Wipe the kid's mouth, for the  love of Christ.  They probably have given up on  wiping his mouth at this point.  You know what?  All the other days of the year,  you could wipe his, not wipe  his mouth. 
[00:25:30]  On the Olympics, when your  other son wins the gold, and  you know the camera's going to  be on young Frederick, wipe his  fucking mouth.  It was foaming, spit, coming  down his chin.  But that stuff doesn't come  through the TV.  You're going to be all right.  No, I saw it.  You saw it all right.  Yeah, but the parents were  actually concentrating on the  moment and the win, instead of  worrying about the aesthetics  of perhaps their child's  drooling.  Yeah, to make sure the other  kid looks good.  Is that it? 
[00:26:00]  And there they are hugging  after he won the gold medal.  I thought that was a great  moment last night.  Logic from Jim again.  Yes.  Your son won a gold medal.  The last thing you're worried  about is drool on your other  son's mouth.  And they also probably expect  that since it's such a  touching moment, that nobody  in media is going to make a  big deal out of it.  Apparently, they've never  heard the Opie and Anthony  show before.  Let's go to some more calls.  866-WOW1-WOW here on the  pre-show.  Paul in Scranton.  What's up, Paul?  Morning, Primetime Sam Roberts.  Good morning, Paul. 
[00:26:30]  What have you got in the  NutriBullet this morning?  Oh, this morning was a big  morning.  A little apple, banana,  blueberry, kale, and a boost.  Which was chia seeds.  But, Opie's got the NutriBullet  in front of him, too.  I got him hooked on the  leafy greens.  Opie has always said that he  was trying to just make  berries and oatmeals and  stuff like that.  I told him, Opie, it's got to  be 50% leafy greens.  I'm sure we'll get into that  today.  As a matter of fact, we were  talking about it yesterday.  And I don't know how we went 
[00:27:00]  from NutriBullet to company  bashing, but one of the art  forms that Opie and Anthony  have perfected is shifting any  topic into bashing the company.  And that happened yesterday.  Let's play track one at the top  of the show, Sal.  Do you think the sales department  is smart enough to call the  NutriBullet people at this point?  No.  Oh, boy.  No, I don't think so either.  No, why would there be?  The guy, the NutriBullet people  tweet me all the time.  They're very excited.  Uh-oh.  And I'm not...  We talk about our lives, that's 
[00:27:30]  all.  But people are buying these  fucking things now because  we're talking about it on the  radio show or mostly me.  So wouldn't you think you  would, you know...  You would think they would  call the NutriBullet people,  but then what, like you said  before the show, they have a  way of fucking up advertisers  every time.  Because the NutriBullet people  probably would just like to buy  maybe a small schedule.  I don't even know.  I'm not in contact with them  in that way.  But they would probably, like,  I would assume, buy a small  package just to see how it  goes.  But of course they'll fucking 
[00:28:00]  try to...  We need a five-year  commitment.  A five-year commitment at  $100,000 a month?  Like, holy fuck.  Come on.  Let the guys dip their toe in  a little first.  Yeah, let them get a little  taste and see if this is for  them.  I bought an advertiser.  I'll never do it again.  Yeah.  Never.  Oh, they've asked me over the  years.  I'm like, no.  I'm not bringing my people over  here.  Until you do things properly.  Yep.  And that really is a huge  commitment.  I don't know if those figures  are correct, but that really  would be outlandish.  Let's go to Doe in North 
[00:28:30]  Carolina.  Is your name Doe?  No, it's Doug.  Oh, Doug.  That's okay.  Doug.  Last night, I don't know all of  the details, Sammy, but there's  this lady that weighs 74 stones.  74 stones.  That's British.  Yes, I know.  She is being accused of killing  her nephew when she rolled over  on him and broke his neck.  Oh, my God.  But in the preview on YouTube, it 
[00:29:00]  shows her husband lifting her up  and wiping her, and it shows that  also it might be worth investigating,  looking into it.  Supposedly, she's the largest woman  ever to be accused of murder, and  they have to cut the wall out of the  side of her house, get her out of the  house to get her to court.  What are they going to fit her in, a jail  cell?  That's not going to happen.  I don't know, but they have, it's  the first time ever that they had  to make room in the courtroom to  get her in for the, it's funny, but  man, it's disgusting, the guy 
[00:29:30]  wiping her ass.  I'm going to look up on YouTube  big fat murderer with a dirty  butthole and see what comes up.  I think I'll be able to find her.  Thanks, Doug.  Have a great day, my friend.  You too.  Definitely going to have a great  day.  There's a couple things I can't wait  to show Opie and Anthony today.  First of all, the preview for  Farrah Abrams' second sex tape has  come out.  She was on the show several months  ago.  She had nothing to add.  It was no doubt why she's chosen the 
[00:30:00]  career path that she has, but now a  second tape has come out, and I think  this one she's not even pretending is  a sex tape.  This one is just straight porn.  So the preview for that is out, and  wait till you hear this, Billy Ray  Cyrus finally has released the song  that we've all been waiting for.  Achy Breaky 2 is officially out.  Yes, it's a hip-hop song, a hip-hop  take on the country classic.  Achy Breaky 2, the video is out. 
[00:30:30]  Wait till you see it.  They're rapping in space.  It's like Jason X, except with Billy  Ray Cyrus and rap music.  It's amazing.  I'm going to show it to Opie and  Anthony.  Hopefully, you'll all be able to  listen to it with us as the Opie and  Anthony show starts right now.  Oh,  oh,  oh,  oh,  oh, 
[00:31:00]  oh.  Thank you. 
[00:31:30]  Thank you. 
[00:32:00]  Thank you. 
[00:32:30]  Thank you. 
[00:33:00]  Thank you. 
[00:33:30]  Thank you. 
[00:34:00]  From the murky banks of terrestrial radio, a new hope begins to rise.  Opie and Anthony are radio shock jocks known for setting up outrageous stunts.  People sure are listening.  Two Long Island natives who together would one day change the world as broadcasting's greatest duo. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  This is beautiful!  After 20 years, these children of the 80s have arrived.  Their hugely popular radio show is not just in New York anymore.  Opie and Anthony show, Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, I don't show on the road.  Through 55-gallon drums and wiffle ball bats.  Oh, in it.  Your question is that you're comfortable.  From mayors to mayor.  It was an April Fool's, Opie and Anthony show, Opie and Anthony show, Opie and Anthony got their hands on the photo and tweeted it. 
[00:35:00]  Two men that have taken a box of cocks further than any.  Well, these people will definitely stop.  Guaranteed.  Lift off the cocks.  They've met friends along the way.  Is this Jim Norton?  I have a raging hard-on right now.  Can I please put my dick in your donuts?  And through fines, scandals, suspensions, cancellations, and terminations, it's the one show that remains unscathed. 
[00:35:30]  Striking fear into the hearts of management everywhere,  comes a radio show that after 20 years remains, above all else, real.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:36:00]  Good morning, everyone. 
[00:36:30]  Hey.  We're just having a quick show meeting.  Trying to figure out sequel songs.  Sequel songs.  Might be one of the little things we do today.  Because stupid Billy Ray Cyrus decided to come out with Achy Breaky 2.  Achy Breaky 2, my daughter's a whore.  Is that what it's called?  I don't know if she's a whore.  She just likes showing her tits.  She's a whore.  I like the Miley Cyrus.  Who doesn't, right?  I like that Miley Cyrus. 
[00:37:00]  She's not holding back.  Now she's showing her boobies.  Her boobs.  Her boobs.  Her boobs.  I couldn't stop saying that last night.  My boobs.  Yeah.  My boobs.  Oh, somebody showed my boobs.  Ugh.  Ugh.  She's disgusting to even show them.  And then to say it like that, just like doubles the disgust.  Well, she's keeping it sexy.  Yeah, certainly is.  She's keeping it sexy for everybody.  My boobs. 
[00:37:30]  My boobs.  Valentine's Day is Friday, right?  Uh-oh.  What are you doing, Reed?  Yes.  No.  I need something cool to get my wife.  Oh, how about some gold roses?  How about get some soft pajamas with a hatch in the back?  No.  What about some chocolate covered snow?  No.  What about some?  No.  No.  Oh, yeah.  How about like a teddy bear with a thing?  And then you get flowers and chocolate.  No.  How about a cart or something? 
[00:38:00]  Oh, I like that idea.  I'm just saying no.  Way to roll with the bitch.  Well, that would have been...  The problem is with Chip, that would have been 10 minutes of material, and now we have  to find something else to talk about.  That's why I fucking hate Chip.  That stupid shit.  Right.  It's just a roadblock.  My pubs.  Maybe we can go around the roadblock and continue.  You don't think Chip helped out?  Oh, my God, no.  Oh, my God, no.  It never helped. 
[00:38:30]  No, I've done all those things, and they're lovely.  Of course.  They're lovely gifts, Ann.  Don't get me wrong.  I love it.  But, man, you've got to come up with something new and different every year, and you have  to.  That's why there's Steven Singer jewelers, right?  What?  He takes care of me.  He knows that.  And I take care of him.  I fake it with Steven Singer.  He's an asshole.  Everyone knows him.  He slid a little fucking something-something in my back pocket when he was here last week.  Did he?  We're good.  We're good with the plugola.  Me and Steven Singer are good.  Nice.  Maybe his and hers are Nutribullets. 
[00:39:00]  Oh.  Now, there you go.  But my chick isn't into the pink shit.  Your chicken?  Imagine if they had a pink Nutribullet for the ladies out there.  Ah, that'd be nice.  Hey, ladies.  Oh, thanks for asking.  Today, Anthony, it's kale, spinach, half a banana.  Went with non-fat yogurt.  I'm just waiting for the boost.  Pineapples.  What is it? 
[00:39:30]  Fuck, I forgot my boost.  Oh, shit.  I swear to God, I forgot my boost.  Over here, I'll tug a few into it.  Please give me a little boost, too.  On my back.  All right, so let me see.  It's six, five minutes of it on the air.  We've gotten a load in the face of my ass and a chip.  And a chip ruling everything.  Right on schedule.  You son of a bitch.  It was so early, I forgot my boost.  Oh, man.  Because I make these things half asleep.  Oh, no.  But I didn't forget my frozen pineapple chunks and my frozen blueberries. 
[00:40:00]  My frozen blueberries.  That sounds good.  But it doesn't matter how delicious everything you put in it.  It always winds up looking like fucking, like the exorcist puke.  Right.  Baby shit.  Yeah, baby shit.  If you ever wonder as a middle-aged man why your poop is brown, get a Nutribullet.  It's all about whatever you grind down.  It just turns brown.  It turns brown.  It is true.  If you mix all paints together and stuff, it always turns brown.  That's why your poopy's brown.  Oh, that makes perfect sense now.  Yeah. 
[00:40:30]  So, Achy Breaky 2.  Achy Breaky 2.  How bad is this thing?  Electric Boogaloo.  Oh.  Is it really bad?  What?  Does it sound like a sideways version of the original?  It's, first of all, it's called Achy Breaky 2, so it's an unapologetic song sequel.  Okay.  What a loser.  They're not even trying to fake it.  20 years later.  Good for him.  That's 20 years, Achy Breaky?  I think so.  90.  Holy shit.  Dude, that ski thing they were doing last night, I don't even know what they call it.  The freestyle?  Oh.  Where it looks like you're snowboarding, sort of, because you're going down the rails and 
[00:41:00]  stuff, but you're on skis.  Yep.  And then they do the two or three amazing jumps.  Yeah.  One broad went down the hill backwards over the big jump.  By the way, Opie says, this is a woman that's worked to aspire to get to the Olympics.  They love being called broads.  And she's relegated to being a broad.  They love being called broads.  I love that.  All the work that went into being on the Olympic team. 
[00:41:30]  Good for them.  This broad.  Some baby machine went down backwards.  Did you see that slit take the jump?  Well, I'll challenge you.  We're all watching the Olympics a little bit here and there.  Name five.  Exactly.  Name five athletes.  Exactly.  They know each other.  I just go, wow, look at the broad going down the...  That broad.  Going down the hill backwards over the huge jump and landing backwards.  That was amazing, but I don't know her name.  But she did it last night.  Point taken.  Although it wasn't last night.  It was about 12 hours before last night or whatever the fuck it is. 
[00:42:00]  NBC teasing if Sean White's going to, like, repeat...  They're trying to build drama.  What is wrong with NBC?  I guess they...  I don't know.  I just feel like there's a better way to do it.  They're teasing it in their opening piece about Sean White.  Will he win his third gold medal on the half pipe?  And everyone knew that it was a huge story that he came in sixth.  Oh.  I think it was sixth.  Everybody knew already?  Of course.  Yeah.  You can't go on anything.  Literally.  Without seeing...  Literally. 
[00:42:30]  You can't go on your Facebook.  No.  You can't do the Twitter.  You're not going to sequester yourself from...  You can't walk around Manhattan.  Social media.  Because they have those fucking news scrolls everywhere now.  Right.  Everywhere.  So you look up, you see.  Right.  Your name catches your eye like, fuck!  Right.  Yeah.  And I was reminded last night that I just hate Matt Lauer.  Matt Lauer?  Oh, did he have to take over for...  Yeah.  Bob Costas is...  Bob Costas is completely blind or something.  The eye infection is spreading, they're saying.  Holy shit. 
[00:43:00]  So he had to take a day.  Does he have to go to some fucking...  Some Russian doctor with a cigarette in his mouth?  Let me look and see the...  Probably.  What is this?  Let's open my...  What the fuck is it?  I don't know.  Last time I see this was during Cold War.  We used to do this to spies.  I think...  Fuck it.  I figured it out.  Yeah.  His finger popped through the toilet paper.  You think it's duty in his eye?  Got a little micro-duty on his finger.  Micro-duty.  And then...  Your technical jargon's... 
[00:43:30]  Confusing everybody.  Or a parasite, maybe.  And then he did the old...  Iraq?  Rub-a-roo.  Parasite.  I'm kidding.  And he rubbed his eye.  Rubbed his eye with duty?  Yep.  Is duty that toxic to the eye?  I do believe it is.  Christ.  Hope not to the palate.  Oh, my God.  Did he get a good one?  See, there you go.  White's disappointing run.  Well, that's just the last 30 or 40 years.  We only had the first few hundred.  What was disappointing about this?  I didn't even see his run. 
[00:44:00]  Did he fall eventually or something?  I don't know.  It looks a little lackluster.  Right.  To be honest with you.  Yeah.  From a guy that, you know, has never even stepped on a snowboard.  Did you see the...  Did we talk about this?  The guy who was a snowboarder who fell?  It was a crash or something?  No.  What was that documentary called about the snowboarder who was injured?  Well, I don't really know.  Ow.  What are you doing?  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  What you hear right now is Anthony attempting to smile. 
[00:44:30]  He's got this rough paper trying to figure this snow.  How do I have tissue?  I ask for tissue.  Every fucking day.  And I get paper towels from an industrial site.  Yeah, those are rough.  Where you can't use those on your nose.  You'll just rip it right off.  Oh, that's what happened to him.  Damn.  Okay.  I didn't even see it.  He shouldn't have cut his hair.  Thank you, Travis.  All his power was in his hair.  Like a Samson and Delilah thing?  Yeah, he had power with that hair.  He cut it and then he loses.  It's obvious it was the hair thing.  It was called Crash Reel. 
[00:45:00]  Crash Reel.  It was a guy who Sean White knew well and they would compete with you.  And this guy would kill Sean White in these competitions.  And he fucking suffered from what they call a TMI, a TBI, traumatic brain injury, I think it's called.  And it was a very sad documentary.  This kid was really fucking great.  He was better than Sean White.  Wow.  And it's all about what happens to him in his life.  And it's called Crash Reel, an HBO documentary.  So if you can see it, see it.  Trending Olympic moments. 
[00:45:30]  Johnny Weir.  Johnny Weir.  But his style's not the only pink thing trending at the Olympics.  You know where I'm going with this.  Yeah, broadcaster Bob Costas has a pretty raging case of pink tie.  Poor Bob.  The infection's so bad that he took Tuesday off.  In fact, it's the first time since 1980.  If you're as big as a monster, you shouldn't be commenting about someone else's problems.  Olympic coverage.  And, of course, the internet having a good time with it.  Are they having a good time with it?  This is Canadian awesomeness at its finest. 
[00:46:00]  No regular beer fridge, my friends.  No beer maker.  It's a go.  Have this bad boy shipped to Team Canada.  That's pretty good.  What is it?  Well, the Canadians have their passports, and you put your Canadian passport in there,  and you can open it up and get beer.  Nice.  Canadians love their beer.  God damn it.  They do.  You can't keep them away from their beer.  Not long.  Yeah, they're awesome.  Oh, so now you're going to invite me to Canada.  What you lack in GDP, you make up for in beer ingenuity.  Oh, dude, you are going to get letters. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, GDP is fucking it.  Some guy won't even fuck it.  He'll have to take it seriously.  Did they use her body for the men's downhill?  Oh.  Oh, see, that's...  She's a large lady.  Thanks for the hips, roomie.  Roomie.  Where were we?  I just want to quickly, again, Time Warner can just suck my fucking dick.  What did they do, right?  Oh. 
[00:47:00]  They set me up nice after I complained.  Did they?  Real nice.  Terrible company.  Well, fuck them.  They're just awful.  Terrible.  Last night, of course, I had to stay at what I like to call the Compound West.  Oh, boy.  The app.  And by the way, when...  I'm off on tangents here, as they call them.  When de Blasio says, you know, the wealthy and, you know, how you live in New York City,  and he thinks a quarter million dollars, $250,000 a year is wealthy in New York,  he's on some type of narcotics. 
[00:47:30]  But you've got to explain that a little bit, because people hearing us somewhere else are like,  that is a lot of fucking money.  Not in New York City.  It's just not in New York City.  I mean, an apartment, if you want a one-room apartment in New York City,  it's between $800 and a million dollars for one room.  For one room.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Unless you want to live in a really shitty neighborhood and risk your life every day  as you, you know, go to and fro work.  I was just thinking how lucky I've been in life and how I've done very well financially 
[00:48:00]  to where I don't have many financial woes.  And there I am in my apartment in New York City, which every winter becomes an icebox.  And I'm sitting there with my fucking gas stove opened and turned on to 500 degrees to heat my fucking...  because this apartment just doesn't have fucking heat.  Like many just apartments in New York City, I think that's the one, like, number one complaint in the winter is they just... 
[00:48:30]  they just don't supply heat in these buildings.  You've got to get higher up.  I swear to you, we've only turned our heat on once this winter.  A 10-story building?  No, man, I'm way out.  I'm on the 8th floor.  We can't turn our heat on.  Yeah.  We don't turn our heat on.  Well, you're in a fancy, en-schmancy building.  No, it's the heat rises and just bakes us.  We had the windows open last year.  That's how hot it gets.  Without us turning the heat on.  If no one in the building has heat, then there's no heat to rise. 
[00:49:00]  So obviously you've got a heat problem for the whole building.  Yes, there's been angry letters left, taped up in the elevator.  Right.  From anonymous people.  You know what's that?  When I was staying in your apartment last year during Sandy, same letters.  Yes.  Same letters in the elevator.  Oh, really?  And it just never stops.  They don't fix it.  There's no radiator.  How do you get heat?  There's like...  What do you got?  There's the pipes that are supposed to carry steam, I guess, to the radiators that run through the floor to the ceiling. 
[00:49:30]  Right.  And that's the only thing that even gets sort of warm.  That's illegal.  Well, probably is, yes.  Wait, you don't...  What happened to the radiator?  I had no radiator.  You never had?  No.  What?  No.  So it's just freezing in there all the time.  Do you have no heat in your apartment?  So technically...  I turned my oven on.  So I...  Why'd you get such a shitty apartment?  I got that apartment in July, my friend.  You're doing well.  I was bamboozled.  That's a shitty apartment.  I was bamboozled.  Why don't you file a lawsuit and fucking get another one?  Yeah, get the hell out of there.  You're just renting anyway, right? 
[00:50:00]  Get the hell out of there.  Move it in my building.  We'll fucking knock the apartments out.  That would be roommates.  Oh, nice.  We'll do a new sitcom called Roomies.  Yeah.  That would be a horror show.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  I can only imagine.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  Exactly.  Big community crib in the middle.  So what's up with the Time Warner and the heat?  And then, so the heat, I'm just kind of laughing that I'm there with the stove open like a fucking...  No.  There's no thermostat in there. 
[00:50:30]  Doesn't make sense.  Dude, you picked a really shitty place.  I don't know what happened.  You gotta get out of there.  Everything else is wonderful except Time Warner, but...  No one pointed out that there was no thermostat?  Yeah, I know.  So you can't even keep it cool in the summer?  No, I have air conditioner.  I have window units.  Oh, okay.  For air conditioning.  Okay, okay.  That building stays there.  Okay.  Yeah, you picked up a shitty, shitty place.  But it's just amazing how, you know, you still do it very well, and I'm there with the stove open like I'm living in fucking Harlem. 
[00:51:00]  Right.  It's amazing.  And then Time Warner.  I fucking...  I'm laying there in bed, and I'm going through the channels, and then my TV just goes,  Please wait.  Please wait!  For what?  It's just, please wait.  And then I...  Because you haven't been there in a while.  It's probably updating everything.  Maybe.  Well, I go to reboot the box for the second time of the day.  I rebooted when I first got into the apartment after work yesterday. 
[00:51:30]  And then...  And it just takes forever.  And then, please wait, so I have to reboot the box again.  It literally...  I was watching a show.  I was watching a show.  I missed the show.  Half hour show.  Because it was rebooting.  It took 20 minutes to reboot the box.  That's great.  The little fucking progress bar.  I hate that.  And then it says, your TV will be right with you. 
[00:52:00]  And then it counts down from 11.  Right.  There's like a little ring with an 11 in it.  All right.  11 to 0 is easy.  You might as well put pictures of kittens in the circle when the numbers mean nothing.  If it's 11, you would think it goes, 11.  Right.  10, 9.  And you're getting some set interval between each number change to justify having numbers at all.  Of course.  It doesn't necessarily mean seconds.  I understand that.  But the time between 11 and 10, and then 10 and 9, and then 9 and 8 should be uniform. 
[00:52:30]  Right.  Because if not, why have numbers at all?  Put hieroglyphics up there.  Have you called Time Warner?  Yes, I have.  It's a box issue.  I get the runaround, as they call it.  Have you gotten a new box?  No.  No.  Because here's the problem.  I don't live there.  So I can't make one of their fucking month in advance.  We'll be there between a 23-hour period appointment and sit in an apartment I'm barely in. 
[00:53:00]  Well, you could do it for one day.  No.  Oh.  All right.  I don't know.  Okay, then.  I don't know what day I'm going to be at the apartment.  No, you just make that the day you are.  But then what if I can't that day?  Don't you like the city?  Yeah, but what if I can't that day?  So you make your appointment, they say it's March 8th, you're like, all right, that's  the day I'm going to be at my apartment.  Book red-eye.  Here's what you do.  You book red-eye.  Say you book you a month out.  They'll book you a month out.  Right.  And then say, can I have an appointment for this time on March 8th?  Oh, and then they'll show up.  Okay, we'll show up sometime between, and then it's like, oh, that's when I'm taping red-eye. 
[00:53:30]  It's just, they suck.  Yeah, they do.  Stop trying to defend them.  Oh, I'm just trying to make your life easier.  I think they're terrible.  They're so bad.  Hey, don't drag me in, man.  I love them.  Their equipment stinks.  After I complained, they gave me the fucking white glove service.  Yeah.  All brand new boxes.  Oh, good for them.  They gave me free channels.  Oh, good.  Good for you.  They dropped my bill a bit. 
[00:54:00]  Oh.  And I said, how can you do that?  And the guy goes, well, that's my gig.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  You know what they should have done for you?  Got you a Fios.  That would have been a gift.  Yes.  And the Fios boxes boot so fucking fast.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  But now I have one problem with Fios.  They're pulling some shenanigans.  Of course.  I believe now, when you go to rent a movie from Netflix, I believe they're using a 28.8 
[00:54:30]  modem to let Netflix stream movies.  On Fios?  Yes.  I've been renting some movies on Netflix, and the pixelation, and it's not that the cable  going out pixelation that I used to get with CableVision, it's just poor bandwidth pixelation.  And I think Fios admitted that they cut back on what they're allowing Netflix to use, as  far as bandwidth goes, on their service.  Is it because they have a competing service? 
[00:55:00]  Because Netflix does have a thing.  I mean, Fios has a thing where you can order their on-demand films.  I use their on-demand.  I mean, is that why you think?  Because it's a competition, almost?  Maybe, but I like having that choice, too, where you go to Netflix, and if they don't  have the movie, you could go to Amazon, Hulu, or Fios, whatever.  That's right, or Apple TV, then, right?  Yeah, yeah, but now they're cutting back on that fucking bandwidth.  There's been some reports about this, that everybody thinks that it's Fios doing it  intentionally, for two reasons, because they own 50% of Redbox, which competes with Netflix. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, that's why.  She should have that checked out.  Redbox.  Speaking of Shirley Temple.  And that it might be a power play with cogent communications, which is who they buy bandwidth  from.  Uh-huh.  So.  It's, uh, it's, it's definitely, there has definitely been a marked fucking decline in  quality.  Well, the solution is to get Time Warner, because.  No, it's not.  I live on.  So I can miss a movie while my box reboots?  No, I live on Netflix. 
[00:56:00]  Fuck.  It rules on Time Warner.  Hold on, haircut from this boy's life has something to say.  It's half an inch longer than yours.  Exactly.  I missed, I missed Scarface while my box was rebooting.  See, it's a long movie.  Yeah, I know.  Go ahead, Cagney and Lacey do.  Yeah, what you're saying is exactly right with the Netflix and Fios, because we were having  that problem as well.  But you've got to get now the Quantum Fios.  I have that.  They upgrade your internet, because if you had Netflix going, your Wi-Fi and everything 
[00:56:30]  else takes forever.  But you can't even look at a basic email.  Do you think I don't have the greatest, bestest service they have available?  Thank you, sir.  I don't know.  I do.  I have the whole schmear, as they call it.  The fastest internet speeds.  Of course.  In and out of the house.  You're a celebrity.  I know.  You got everything.  You got the new modem and everything.  Everything.  And you're still having a problem.  But everything's fine, except Netflix. 
[00:57:00]  Like, the quality of everything is amazing.  Yeah, but that's a big deal.  Except fucking Netflix.  Yes.  We all love Netflix now.  Tis.  Love it.  Tis.  Now, I'm wondering.  Maybe it's just your area.  Because we did the Quantum, and we did the new...  What the fuck is this guy saying?  He's crazy.  We did the Quantum Upgrade Package and the new modem that they send you to put everything  in there.  So then you're doing Xbox and Netflix and everything, and now it's working fine.  But is your Netflix quality...  Yeah, it doesn't stutter.  No, there's no stutter. 
[00:57:30]  Let's say there's the beginning of a movie you're watching, and there's text.  This is a true story or something like that.  The text is pixelated a bit, where it looks a little blurry.  It's that type of quality degradation.  It isn't a stutter or a clip or anything like that.  Could it be...  Maybe it's easier to stream cartoons.  You know what?  Oh, wow.  The quality, the bandwidth needed for cartoons is probably a lot less.  Oh, no.  Oh, that makes perfect sense.  Oh, I watch real people shows.  Real people.  I watch big people's programs. 
[00:58:00]  I watch movies.  You can't tell if Thundercats are Masters of the Universe.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I get it.  We got to the bottom.  I get it.  I wonder if I stream Netflix through something other than the Fios app or something.  Try...  You have Xbox One.  Try it through Xbox One.  Yes, I do.  Well, that's what I've been doing.  I just realized to myself right here, as we were speaking, that I was talking about my  bone coal.  There you go. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  All right.  So that sounds like you had a good night.  Yeah.  No heat and no cable.  No heat.  My cable stinks.  It was great.  What are you going to do?  You got a shitty apartment.  You got to get out of there.  That's just dumb.  We got to get out of this place.  Don't you think?  I think.  Occasionally.  Try not to very much.  But fucking...  Sometimes.  There's amazing apartments you get.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  At least get one with heat.  For 2,300 months? 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, you get a nice fucking one.  But 2,300 months is...  You'll at least get one with heat.  Close to here, because I need it within walking distance of here.  I don't know why you're around here to live, to be honest with you.  What am I going to do?  I got to...  There's cabs and subways and...  Fuck that in the morning or anything else.  And enjoy Manhattan.  Walk it a little bit.  Fuck that.  You go a little more west or a little more north and you got some solid, solid places.  I'm a six minute cab ride here.  I love it.  It's utilitarian.  I'm not here for pleasure.  You're...  Westchester's... 
[00:59:30]  By here he means earth.  No, I need it.  Like, if I'm doing Red Eye or something like that, or Hannity, I like to be able to take  a shower, hang out, watch, and then walk over to Fox News.  It's just a shitty area to live, because of Times Square and all that.  I don't give a shit, though.  It's fucking...  It's your thing.  I like that it's that close to here, to work.  I need a neighborhood.  It's the reason.  I have a neighborhood.  It's out on Long Island and it's beautiful.  When I stay here, the only reason I got the apartment is so I wouldn't consistently have 
[01:00:00]  to depend on hotel rooms being available.  Right.  And I would always get a hotel room right in Times Square, because it's walking distance.  Right.  It's nothing about really, you know, enjoying the area.  I would definitely go somewhere.  So you missed the Olympics?  Ah!  Yeah, I wasn't really watching much of the Olympics yesterday.  I was watching a lot of curling yesterday.  A lot of curling?  Yeah.  Were you getting into it?  Were you yelling?  No, not at all.  The Americans got their ass kicked by the Brits, the females. 
[01:00:30]  I thought the Russians got them.  But the...  What is it?  A stone?  Or...  Yeah.  Stone, the hammer.  I got...  She's got the hammer.  What does that mean?  That means it's her turn to throw the stone toward the button?  Oh.  Or to put guard up?  Wow.  Something like that?  You really were watching.  Right.  Paying attention.  But the female bra that, you know, slides the stones?  Yeah.  She had big tits.  Really?  And you could see him? 
[01:01:00]  Were they like...  Could you get a picture of her?  Was she using a...  Was she low-cut top?  Which team?  No.  That would make curling rule if they had low-cut tops.  Oh, no.  What's with Tom Brokaw?  You didn't hear?  He's cancer.  Of the what?  Well, Time Warner really fucked you up.  You didn't...  You don't know this?  I couldn't...  He has marrow cancer.  He has marrow cancer.  Oh, no.  No.  Is that a terrible one?  It sounds bad, but is that one of the ones that they can kind of work with, or is that  a motherfucker?  He says the doctors have confidence. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, no.  What does Opie say?  Good luck, bro.  Oh, no.  Not another one.  Not another anchor.  He's 74.  I would have thought he was older considering how long he's been on our lives.  I've told Anthony for years, 74 is the evil age.  Oh, my God.  So many men die at the age of 74.  Put it in the back of your brain.  You'll see it for yourself.  If you could get past 74, you make it well into your 80s.  80s, 74 is the number, for whatever reason, where the man's body breaks down. 
[01:02:00]  Gee.  Yes.  Curling, do you have the blonde?  Which team is it?  U.S. of A.  She's a little older, but she's got some biggums.  I still think we should have...  And they wear some kind of like...  They wear like fleeces or something.  We should have made Bobo watch the curling and done curling with curling.  Right.  And have him give his assessment of the curling.  Curling with curling.  Get him on the phone. 
[01:02:30]  That might be her.  Go up again.  Not her.  She's a little older, to be honest with you.  The curling broads are really nice.  Hey, do you remember these fucking Winter Olympic girls being so cute?  What the fuck?  And in curling, they wear eye makeup, which I...  No, go...  Yeah, because they're not doing anything.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Fucking hummels.  That's not the U.S. team.  No, no, no.  Fucking...  Go down.  One person slides something, the others are swiffering the floor.  It's a totally worthless...  One, two, three, four.  Yeah, if you could wear makeup during your sport, it's crazy.  That's her. 
[01:03:00]  I can't tell right there.  It's going like the downhill.  You can't tell right there, but she has big boobies.  Oh, man.  A big boobie is.  It's a very attractive batch of women in the Winter Olympics.  Yeah.  Fucking amazing.  As it should be.  Yeah, you see the paper today?  They got...  These Nordic blondes.  Love it.  They got the Russian...  Do you see this picture yet?  Holy fuck, stick.  What the hell?  Right over the Tom Brokaw cancer story.  Oh, that's right.  No respect for Tom Brokaw.  Oh, God.  But if Tom Brokaw looked up, he could see a little taint. 
[01:03:30]  He's got to look up and he would see a nice view.  Some taint.  These are the Russian curlers and they're in lingerie.  Not too busy, though.  Sexy.  On the border of being busy lingerie.  Look at that leg.  Yeah, they got high heels on, bending over with their sweeper.  Christ.  Jesus H. Christ.  It's pretty sad.  This is how women...  This is what women have to do to get attention for their sports.  Yeah.  You don't see guys having to, like, fucking sex it up so people pay attention to their sport. 
[01:04:00]  But women athletes, this is what they have to do.  Sex it up.  They have to sex it up.  Well, they sex up the guys.  Not like the women.  These women, they're forcing them to go in lingerie and go in their curling poses.  Well, people like Beckham, they have to be, like, shirtless all the time, right?  That's true.  Beckham.  They love the shirtless guys.  Average soccer player at best.  Guys.  Well, it's because he was so handsome.  That's right.  That's why the girls liked him.  That's her.  See?  You can tell how giant they are to her. 
[01:04:30]  Wow, they're bursting out through her fucking big heavy coat.  It's a, I don't know, a zip-up.  Almost like a fleece kind of thing.  Looks like Gore-Tex.  Yeah, she's got big ones.  As I noticed.  Yeah.  Yeah, not the greatest in the face.  No, but, yeah, she's got them big titties, though.  You know, you don't have to elevate your eye level any higher.  No.  And then they went back to that stupid ice skating last night.  I can't do it.  What type of ice skating?  I could do the female individuals. 
[01:05:00]  Individuals.  Oh, figure skating.  Oh, boy.  Did I say figure skating?  No, you said ice skating, which I thought maybe speed skating.  Oh, figure skating.  Figure skating, yeah.  I can only do female, individual.  That's it.  I don't give a fuck about the guys, the pairs, the ice dancing, all that shit.  Right?  You don't like watching the guys in feminine-looking tuxedos.  Dude, if you've got a Facebook page, go on your Facebook page, and these women, they love watching figure skating.  The prancing gentlemen?  They like that? 
[01:05:30]  The prancing gentlemen.  The guys just prancing on the ice, that's what they do.  They prance.  They love it all.  They can't get enough of it.  Really?  They can't get enough of figure skating.  Because I don't mind the girls.  I don't mind watching the girls.  It's very, uh...  Yeah, it's just amazing what they can do.  Yeah, the individual female.  That's great.  And I do like the occasional fall on their ass.  That's always entertaining.  They try to do one of those fucking triple spin things.  Blacksle.  Dude, your boy, Christy, is in deep shit.  Hey, they said that the helicopters were, every time, nowhere near the bridge.  No, it's fine. 
[01:06:00]  That's what I heard this morning.  But he's not allowing his staff to, uh, you know...  By the way, he's not my boy.  He's your boy.  My boy.  Your boy, Christy.  He's not allowing his staff to testify.  You had high hopes for Christy.  No, not really.  Why would you let...  Some kind of executive privilege.  He's trying to push.  Yeah.  How is that an option?  I know.  It should be a...  I guess it's an option on this level, I think.  Yeah.  It's a chess game, and then the feds or whoever the fuck are going to go, oh, yeah?  But this is fucking ridiculous.  They're spending so much time and energy on this when... 
[01:06:30]  No, only MSNBC is.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  That's true.  Chris Matthews.  Yeah.  Oh.  He's all about this every night.  Chris Matthews.  Is his hair all in a disarray?  I can't believe this guy is still in office.  Every night at 7 o'clock, Chris Matthews goes after Governor Christy.  It's hilarious.  I'm actually watching every night at 7 to see what he's got on Christy now.  And then you go to all the other news channels, and they're barely talking about the Christy  thing at this point.  They should be talking about your boy Obama, because that guy's changing the fucking laws  that are being passed, that were passed. 
[01:07:00]  You know, you've got Congress changes, passes a law.  Right.  You can't then just willy-nilly start changing the law without congressional approval.  But he, you know, decides he's going to do it.  Yeah, but your boy Christy was holding back Sandy funds.  What?  Holding it back.  Strong-arming some people.  More importantly, though...  And Hoboken.  A constitutional faux pas that your boy Obama's making is against the law.  When I came up with the boy bit, I thought it was fun. 
[01:07:30]  But then when it's pushed back at you, it sucks.  Because you can't deny it.  Well, you deny it.  Because I don't want people to think I'm an Obama guy.  Your boy.  I'm not an Obama guy.  Stupid Sean Hannity fucking started that shit.  Your boy Obama.  He was convinced that I was into Obama because I said at the time that it was obvious Obama was going to win the election when everyone thought he didn't have a shot because of his skin color and all that shit.  Right.  That's where that came from.  Oh, man.  My stance is very easy.  I hate them all. 
[01:08:00]  I hate them all.  They do all suck.  They do, right?  They really do.  You're starting to think that.  It's just infuriating.  No.  It's just all posturing for the next election without any fucking care whatsoever about what is actually happening to the country.  Nope.  Wonderful.  And I don't think Obama should be allowed to campaign.  Right?  While he's the president.  Doesn't he have a job to do apparently?  Especially if, you know, he can't, you know, run again. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  So he should not be allowed to hit the road to campaign for other fucking people.  Well.  The president shouldn't have enough time to do that.  No.  It's the president.  Is there any way we can change that law at least?  You want your president, whether you like him or hate him, in the fucking White House trying to figure shit out.  I hate when all of a sudden you hear he's hitting the campaign trail for these candidates.  Yeah.  That's bullshit.  Well, the good thing is none of the Democrats want him, so.  Right.  But you're trying to tell me there's nothing else he could be doing, you know, productively in the White House that he could hit the road and campaign for people? 
[01:09:00]  He has been campaigning.  And every president does that.  His entire term.  Right.  He's been campaigning.  That's fucking horseshit.  Fucking gay.  I understand if you're the president and you want to be re-elected, okay, you've got to campaign a little bit, sure.  But not for other guys, ever.  Yeah.  You'll let them do their heavy lifting.  Yeah.  Christine.  That's your boy. 
[01:09:30]  MSNBC just fucking cannot stop about this guy.  They were hoping to get something with that helicopter.  What did they find out?  Well, they checked his helicopter records, and what they were hoping for was that those days that there was the big traffic jam.  That he was kind of hovering above laughing.  That he was, his helicopter was fixed right over the bridge.  But it makes for a great visual.  I would love to think Governor Christie was hovering with a big man sandwich just laughing his ass off while people were stuck in traffic. 
[01:10:00]  And then telling the helicopter pilot, let's see how far back this is.  Could you please just go a little further down the bridge?  Look at these fucking people.  Then no one's moving.  No one's fucking moving.  This is hilarious.  Who thought that was your idea, right?  This is great.  Look, if any of this comes out, though, I'm going to say I know nothing about it.  Right.  These exclusive radio transmissions were caught from the helicopter. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, that visual just makes me fucking laugh.  Eating a giant fucking man sandwich.  I'm obsessed with the man sandwich.  A mile high.  Especially when a broad eats a man sandwich.  A man sandwich.  The Dagwood.  He had a big Dagwood on the helicopter watching the traffic jam.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, shit.  That's it for the Olympics, I guess. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah, I really wasn't paying much attention yesterday.  As soon as I went back to figure skating, I was done.  I'm like, come on, man.  Punched out of that one, eh?  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Some of the skiing stuff was cool as shit, though.  The women skiing down that hill with the tricks.  Fuck.  Just amazing.  Yeah.  Because you have to go off those huge ramps for the first time.  I don't know how you practice that, yeah.  I guess you practice into nets and fucking foam pit and water and stuff.  We did that in winter camp and you had, it was a pit, it was a foam pit filled with 
[01:11:30]  those, uh, filled with, like, foam balls.  No, you don't like doing anything.  Foam balls.  It was winter camp.  No.  No, I don't think it was winter camp.  Winter camp.  I went to winter camp.  Oh, no one goes to winter camp.  I did.  Winter camp.  I'd go every year.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yes.  I wish it was Treblinka.  If I did, I'd miss it.  Oh, boy.  Oh, God.  We're getting an update on Tom Brokaw.  All right, hold on.  Hello.  My marrow. 
[01:12:00]  Brian in Chicago.  Brian.  Yeah, how's it going?  Hey, buddy.  My stepmom died of multiple myeloma.  It's an incurable bone cancer.  It actually eats the bone from the inside out.  She was just sitting and getting compound pressure fractures in her spine where they  had to go in.  Like Mr. Glass from Unbreakable.  Inject cement into it.  Inject cement.  Wow.  Yeah.  To keep the spine sort of.  That'd make you heavy.  Yeah, no kidding. 
[01:12:30]  What's all the pressures on their nerves?  You're saying what Tom Brokaw has is incurable?  Oh, man.  Absolutely.  Oh, how many spinals does he have?  He's got to count those things.  Make sure he's okay.  74.  How long does it take, though?  She deteriorated probably over about a year and a half.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, we don't know how long he's had since the summer.  Oh, my God.  How do you get marrow cancer?  Can we work on that?  Yeah, that'd be nice.  Stop smoking cigarettes through your bones.  How do you get that?  I don't know. 
[01:13:00]  That seems like a motherfucker.  All right, blood cancer.  There's so many awful shit cancers.  It just seems like it would be very hard to get to.  Right.  To try to fix it.  It's right there.  There's no just cutting out your bone marrow.  No.  Oh, poor fucking bastard.  Jesus.  That's horrible.  Metal standings.  Norway.  11, Canada 9.  Netherlands 8.  United States 7.  Russia 7.  There you go.  Oh, are we sucking ass?  Look at Norway.  No, Norway and Canada.  Norway's supposed to win. 
[01:13:30]  I know.  That's those fucking, you know, the blonde haired skiing their entire lives.  Black dude in the Olympics.  Oh, boy.  Did you see that?  Is America focusing on this guy?  Are they?  Oh, yeah.  Is that the big fucking story?  That's the one.  Why?  Because America loves its black people in sports, so they got to keep pushing because  he's really the only guy.  A black speed skater.  But for the most part, he's the speed skater.  Yeah.  Yep.  Huh.  Is he good?  I have no idea. 
[01:14:00]  So, Davis says he goes into this competition, which starts in just about two hours, with  a huge target on his back.  Oh, boy.  Because he's black.  Yeah.  Not nice.  When he beat Davis in just a lower-level competition last year, the state government there gave  him a two-bedroom apartment.  Kuzin says if he beats Davis today, they're probably just going to give him the whole country  of Kazakhstan.  Wow.  I don't know if the mayor of Chicago, where Davis is from, has plenty on giving away any  real estate.  But Davis says he is plenty motivated. 
[01:14:30]  And in fact, John, he's going to compete in the 1500s as well.  What a worse fucking commentary this is.  I've got two hands.  I'm ready to get two medals.  That was a big closer.  Building shakes during these events.  Talking about building shaking.  Just a huge hockey game coming up between Team USA and Team Canada.  That's set to go at 7.30.  You fucking Canucks.  We'll show you.  These two teams still like each other, Rachel.  Oh.  Rachel, more commentary?  No.  They got into a fight, and that might not seem like women's hockey. 
[01:15:00]  Fight, fight.  Hey, the stakes are high.  In fact, as one of the Canadian players said recently, the Olympics, this is our Stanley  Cup.  And there's no more better rivals than the Canadian and the American women's players.  Ladies hockey is pretty good.  And they're fighting now, too.  Ladies.  The Americans won the first gold medal.  All right.  The battle is fucking nice.  Shove that stick right up there.  Hey, let's get some Olympic coverage on.  Ooh.  What do they got on right now?  Yeah, we should.  Probably stupid curling again.  Two hours, we can watch the black guy. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  See how he does in his speed skating.  Yeah, we got to watch whatever his name is.  Davis?  Davis, of course.  Is that what his name is?  Of course.  I have no idea.  I thought maybe Davis was the other guy.  I think it might be Davis.  Right?  Yeah.  Nice.  Yeah, I think so.  All right, we're going to break.  We got food in front of us.  I need a showbiz name, and Jim Norton's not cutting it.  I'm going to change it.  To Len Davis.  Len Davis.  That's my new showbiz name. 
[01:16:00]  I won't answer to Jim anymore.  Is that showbizzy enough?  Len Davis?  Len Davis.  Yeah.  No, no.  It's Len, quote unquote, Lenny Davis.  Len Lenny Davis.  That's showbiz.  I hate the quote name.  Lenny.  That makes it showbiz.  But it's showbiz.  Yeah, Lenny Davis.  All right, Lenny.  When we get back, people are asking if we've heard the new Billy Ray Cyrus song.  Oh, it's so good.  And it gets us thinking about other sequel songs.  You know why else it's good?  Because, you know.  It is curling.  See, I told you it would be fucking curling.

Dude, what are you doing tonight?  I said, I'm playing down the village.  I'm going to fucking hang out, and I'm going to meet up with some friends.  It's going to be great.  On the way over, we cabbed it, and some kid from NYU left his knapsack with all his books 
[01:27:30]  and no books.  So, you know what?  I'll be a nice guy.  How cool will this be?  Guy from Saturday Live is going to send him back his books.  I said, well, this is a thorn in Lars's ass for the minute I get it.  For the minute I get it, he's like, dude, what are you doing with the fucking nap?  Give me the fuck?  It's ridiculous.  You look like a fag walking around with his fucking knapsack.  So I'm walking around with this thing.  I said, I'm going to give it back.  Why does the knapsack bother you?  It's fucking stupid.  Fuck that guy. 
[01:28:00]  He's irresponsible.  Fuck him.  It'll teach him a lesson.  He tears the knapsack off my back.  So what are you doing?  He tosses it across the street, hits some chick in the leg, and it opens up, and the bags go  all over.  And he's walking down the village going like this.  There's your fucking knapsack, huh?  Are we hanging?  Fucking knapsack, huh?  Huh?  I'm like, Lars, what are you doing?  Chill out.  And he keeps getting on my face.  Oh, you're hanging on a wall?  I went, I don't know if I can live up to this. 
[01:28:30]  I talk a great game, but I don't know if I can live up to this status.  Stay tuned for more bedtime stories with Jim Brewer.  This is with Jervais.  Hi, this is with Jervais.  Welcome to you back to the Ovi Anthony Show.  With Jim Norton, of course.  Love Jim Norton.  Love his little strange face and head and brain.  Nice.  Thank you, Rick.  Oh.  Hurrah!  Hurrah! 
[01:29:00]  There's something like that.  I like it.  It's very hard to do.  You won't be better with a cold.  Yeah, I want to remind the people that it's podcast day.  The Ovi and Anthony podcast.  A brand new episode every Wednesday.  and this week we're talking  Ricky Gervais and Joe Rogan  together  on the podcast, together  so go get that right now 
[01:29:30]  I'll tweet it and  the show's Twitter account  has the link and blah blah blah  GTA 4  has Ricky Gervais in it  like if you're watching the TV  I was watching some of that last night  laughing my ass off  it's a computer generated fucking Ricky Gervais  and he's just doing stand-up  and it's his material, it's his voice  and he's moving like Ricky Gervais  it's really fucking cool  it was the last version of GTA 4 
[01:30:00]  the newest?  no, we're up to 5  are you still playing 5?  not me, no, because I  went to the Xbox One  and they released it  for the Xbox 360  so I do not have it  they don't have it on the One?  no, they don't have it for the One yet?  no  why?  because they made it for the 360  because everyone had a 360  right  if they made it for the One  they would get  you know, they wouldn't have sold  that many copies  couldn't they make a couple of copies? 
[01:30:30]  you would think  I think they're  Lazlo didn't want to say anything  when he was here  it's always very secretive  it's always very secretive  the world of video gaming  well  but  apparently  they'd be silly  not to put out  a 5 for  Xbox One  and PS4  so when they're making these games  they've got to figure out  which is going to be the hot console  exactly  and the fact that  the Xbox One  was just going to come out  a little bit after  they came out with GTA 5  they knew that everyone  had their 360s already  so why put it out for a gaming system 
[01:31:00]  no one even had yet?  well and these are also in development  for 5 years  yeah  exactly  yeah, that's true too  so they don't even know  what the platform's going to be  you've got to kind of figure it out  and hope  you've got to figure it out  I would assume  that they are going to release  GTA 5  with  yeah  exactly  for the  for the  Xbox One  which I'm loving man  I have the PS4  which I hooked up also  and I barely use it  because  the Xbox One  just  being able to go  Xbox 
[01:31:30]  go to Netflix  right  which I  by the way  when I talk about this  I get complaints on Twitter  from people that say  they were playing  and listening to  the show  and from me saying that  it changes their  fucking screen  oh hilarious  so wait  Xbox sign out  there's no way that works  it does  oh it's great  did you see that video  of  Xbox watch TV  yeah  of this guy  who plays Call of Duty  and his gamer tag  is Xbox sign out  is Xbox sign out 
[01:32:00]  and then he just gets  in people's way  right  and they go  move Xbox sign out  no  no  that's hilarious  it's really funny man  people video of that  people just know  how to be dicks  Xbox sign out  he probably didn't  realize that  no  it was a joke  he knew was coming  is that it right there  Xbox sign out  Xbox sign out  on the Xbox One  then we get people mad  because usually  when people get mad  they'll say  you're a gamer tag  in rage  so when they say 
[01:32:30]  Xbox sign out  it'll bring them  up to this screen  now some people  will hit the sign out  button because they're  dumb  but most of the people  will catch themselves  and give us a good  reaction  and if you enjoyed  the video make sure  to leave a like below  Xbox sign out  get out of my way  you freaker  Xbox sign out  Xbox sign out  get out of my way  I don't want to say this

[01:43:30]  and julia's older  and she said  that she would  always criticize  her weight  and tell her  she needed to  lose weight  but who knows  because this girl  kind of seems  like a me me me  girl  so she kind  of annoys me  yeah i mean  not as bad  as penny  but wow  this girl kind  of annoys me  so who knows  how much of  it's julia roberts  julia roberts  late half sister  left a suicide  note citing her  torture relationship  with the oscar  winner  it was definitely  a suicide  she left a  five page  suicide letter  the emt  found it  the source  told the news 
[01:44:00]  there were  three pages  of rantings  that her sister  drove her  to do this  yes  wow  that's me  me me  shit  exactly  take responsibility  for your own  life  gonna kill yourself  and you have a  fiance and you're  gonna leave him  because your starlet  sister ignores you  go fuck yourself  i have no tolerance  for this shit  little jelly  apparently they  had never had a  great relationship  and maybe she  wanted some kind  of help in  hollywood and julia  maybe julia was  shitty i don't know  but then it was  like she was  beating up  she gave a tell 
[01:44:30]  all interview  right  and that had  they had a big  falling out  and she would  fucking attack  julia a little  bit on twitter  so i think she  just wanted some  attention  they just didn't  get along  it happens  even if you're  blood  there was one  page to her  mom telling her  how much she  loved her  and one page  apologizing to  her fiance  the source said  selfish cunt  what's this broad's  name  i'm saying broad  a lot today  my fiance  oh okay  the fiance found  the body of  nancy moats  37 about 2pm 
[01:45:00]  sunday in a  bathtub filled  with water at a  los angeles home  laying around a  castle  she's a moat  but this poor  fiance she's  gonna marry this  guy and this  selfish motherfucker  just leaves him a  note  how awful  moats had been  pet sitting for a  client who rented  the home she may  have been dead for  about 12 hours  before her body  was found  it looks like a  pill overdose  moats a georgia  native was the  daughter of robert's  mother betty  lu and stepfather  michael moats  so they had the  same mama  yeah  right 
[01:45:30]  she had a  falling out with  roberts 46  after giving a  tell-all interview  last summer and  accusing the pretty  woman actress of  blocking her access  to their sick  mother the source  said  what's that  about  no idea  you can't block  your sister from  seeing your mother  right  yeah i don't know  that seems a little  weird  yeah  in the days leading  up to moat's  death  she sounded  emotionally unstable  in post on her  twitter account  so my sister said  that with all her  friends and fans  she doesn't need  any more love 
[01:46:00]  just so you all  know  america's sweetheart  is a bitch  damn  she tweeted that  on january 20th  referring to robert's  star turn in the  2001  rom-com  america's sweethearts  how does she get  along with her  brother sam  that's right  oh right  yes  you know what the  problem is that she  didn't fucking not one  thing about what she  did wrong  that's why i think  she's a me me me  because she's not  it's all julia  not her at all  right  although didn't julia  have a falling out  with her brother 
[01:46:30]  what's his name  eric roberts  yeah i mean look  she may be difficult  or it could be that  they're jealous of her  too i mean that  could be a part of it  yeah  when you're a big star  and your baby sister  comes out to be the  biggest thing in  hollywood  maybe it's  again  but to defend julia  roberts eric roberts  is a complete mess  maybe she finally had it  yeah  like he went on  the celebrity rehab  or the sober house  celebrity rehab  for addiction to  marijuana  yeah he loves his  marijuana  marijuana  and they've had him  on tv about uh  philip seymour  hoffman's death 
[01:47:00]  oh yeah  because he's an addict  what's he saying  i think he said  that he did some  some shit  but not a lot of it  he didn't do a lot  of the hard stuff  oh  but he uh  admitted that he  dipped into that  as well  so maybe julia  roberts just had it  uh huh  you have to deal  with this fucking  me me me shit  it gets to be enough  after a while  me  do you want to be  a fan of someone  so cruel  she's not even  that good of an  actress  oh really  really  she's not  not as far as  she's concerned  dumb sister  happy you totally 
[01:47:30]  fucked with me  she added  in another  tweet  my own family  has abandoned me  um  moats tweeted  on january 22nd  see that's my  whole family  abandoned me  me  me  right  and someone just  said on twitter  by the way  i heard julia  would trash her  in the press  but i never  heard that  i never even  knew this woman  existed  so what the  fuck  it's okay  who knew  they didn't like  each other  right  so you're gonna  kill yourself  over that  she showed her 
[01:48:00]  moats uh  large struggled  with being overweight  and living in her  movie star  sister's shadow  well i doubt that  i mean literally  i imagine  she probably  overlapped the  edges of that  shadow  she's fat  well it looks  like the sperm  had the talent  though  because they  showed her  the mob  but it looks  like uh  yeah  you know  the sperm  that made  julia roberts  was the  important part  of that  union  in august  moats gave  an interview  claiming  roberts  criticized her 
[01:48:30]  appearance as  a teen  oh yeah  when i was in  high school  and she was  an adult  she would  just let  me know  that i was  definitely  overweight  moats  said at  the time  don't tell  her what's  okay so  don't tell  you something  about yourself  that's  unpleasant  if you're  drinking too  much  you shouldn't  say it  if you're  smoking too  many cigarettes  you shouldn't  say it  it just makes  me feel  incredibly hurt  and very sad  of course  added moats  who once  weighed nearly  300 pounds  nice  well why would  her sister  comment on that  before her  decision to  undergo  gastric bypass  surgery in 
[01:49:00]  2010  she said  she said she  hoped her  transformation  would help  repair their  fractured  relationship  so she was  hoping if she  got thinner  that julie  roberts would  like her  i guess  i would assume  it was a lot  deeper than  your weight  maybe julie is  you know  difficult  maybe  but i bet  she is  but you're  gonna kill  yourself over  that  there's  nothing to  base that  on  that's just a  guess  i'm just  saying she  looks it  she said it  was still a  work in progress  as far as  the relationship  went with julie  roberts after  the surgery  it's not  going to be  fixed overnight  nor do i 
[01:49:30]  think it's  going to be  fixed at  this point  by me just  getting skinny  she said  but why air  that like who  gives a fuck  about you and  your sister  right like why  do we need to  know what you  and julie like  how much julia  do you think  who cares  yeah go live  your life  your sister just  happens to be a  huge hollywood  star  yeah  all right  now what  yeah  deal  deal with it  exactly  that's incredibly  selfish to leave  a note like that  behind  and your  fucking fiance 
[01:50:00]  and your  fiance  on top of  that's how  you know  it's me  me me  right  she didn't  even look like  her  no not at  all  at least  no not at  all  she got like  the big mouth  but it's the  fucked up mouth  right  like julia  roberts has  that big mouth  but people loved  like the teeth  and the lips  she got  snaggly teeth  and fucking  it's gotta be  the dad's  scar  that's what  you get  yeah  she had the  wrong dad  that's it  nice 
[01:50:30]  well bye bye  funny man  woman  whatever  woman  adios  adios  i saw a great  documentary on  on the improv  have you seen  that one yet  it's on  i think it's on  epics  epics has a  fuck load of  good documentaries  great documentaries  yeah it's got  like seinfeld  and leno  and uh  just a bunch  of comics  coffin  talking about  yeah they  talk about  all that  shit  uh but it's  a pretty good  documentary about 
[01:51:00]  uh comics  and how they  uh came up  with the improv  in new york  and then l.a  and so it's  pretty cool  it's on epics  i never worked  in new york  for people  i went  i went in  there once  in my life  uh his wife  silva ran  that for a  long time  after i guess  they split  and uh  it was a pretty  legendary club  and i went in  there once i think  to pick up auto  or something  or just to say  i'm glad i went  in there once  but i never  did a set there  it's really cool  to watch those  documentaries like  that and see  uh some just  black and white  pictures of all  these legendary  comics just so 
[01:51:30]  young and they're  just hanging around  with their arms  around each other  on the stage  like fucking  off and right  like jesus christ  that's a whole  fucking stage full  of legends  in 1971  richard pryor  taped his  first stand-up  there and uh  it's it's great  because you can see  like the menus  in the background  they showed  some of that  and he bombs  it's called uh  still smoking  and it was it  was so bad  like i guess it  wasn't what he  wanted  yeah he released  it got released  in 81 when he 
[01:52:00]  was a giant star  but that material  it was really  primitive like  it was stuff  that was going  to go on  this two album  an album came  after called  that nigger's  crazy and that's  where a lot of  that material wound  up but this is it  and it's kind of  it's primitive stages  yeah he's just  working it out  it's my fucking  favorite comedy  thing ever  is to watch him  up because he's  just smoking  and he's being  very real and  very natural  and he's really  yeah you could  see struggling  and frustrated  that he's not  getting the laughs  um and he  admits that he's  uh nervous  and he's just  talks about 
[01:52:30]  sucking a dick  and it's like  all this  yeah man  it's  his mother being  a hooker  and it was like  it was fucking  just an amazing  comedy special  it's like 35  minutes it's not  that long  i gotta check  that out  they showed  some of that  oh they did  yeah they showed  some of that  they showed  some carlin  they showed  uh andy kaufman  uh there's some  just some great  clips and then  a great commentary  by a lot of  comics and stuff  uh about the  improv  it was really good  it's on epics  epics uh  you go to epics  documentaries  it's just a  fucking shitload 
[01:53:00]  of really cool  fucking documentaries  how'd you get  epics  i don't know  time warner  it's uh  you know what  on fios  it's right there  on fios  i don't think  time warner  has the epics  you know what  i think they  just went on  time warner  they did  yes uh  that's good to  know  epics is getting  on every  it seems like  every platform  yeah it's definitely  becoming  it's a process  it's like anything  i think hbo  and comedy central  do you remember  when comedy central  years ago  it was just a joke  but it was only on  like you'd get it  for a few hours a day  yeah and then they  would change it  to something else 
[01:53:30]  yeah so it's  yeah you're right  it's starting up  and documentaries  are a very smart  way to go  stand up and  documentaries  because  documentaries rule  they do rule  and it's fucking  even if it's a  dumb song  it's great  it's amazing  what you'll watch  in a documentary  form  like who gives  a shit  you have no  interest in how  oh look at that  yeah  this is how they  make rubber  yeah exactly  yeah very cool  though you'll  you'll like it  i'll definitely  watch it  i haven't looked  at their section  of documentaries  i just i have  i think sometimes 
[01:54:00]  i forget to go  to it  fuck low  that's the one  that had the  um  flight 800  documentaries on  uh yeah  flight 800  and then the uh  the one on uh  playboy and penthouse  oh right  okay  yeah  yeah  yeah really cool  very cool  yeah  it's so hard to find  there's so much out there  but it's still so hard to find  something to fucking watch  somebody made a joke about  netflix and the fact that  you spend more time  searching  than you do actually  watching movies on  netflix  well the problem is 
[01:54:30]  there's so many channels  and so many choices  that it takes forever  to just go through  your regular cable  to go oh fuck  this is on  on this weird channel  you have to really  give it some effort  to find the good shit  the rationalization  you do  when you're searching  for a movie  right  it's like  you'll be searching  for so long  that i'll just start  going  i don't care what it is  the first movie i see  that i even think  i might want to watch  i'm gonna watch it  and then you go  and you see one of  those movies  you're like  no let me just  go a little further  you ever see a movie 
[01:55:00]  that you might want  to watch  but then you run  the whole movie  through your head  in like a couple  of seconds  and you're like  nah i'm not gonna  watch that  i just watched it  in my head  absolutely  yeah  a lot of shit  out there  literally  what was uh  what did i just see  that came from  playboy 2  that was sparked  by playboy  and that hefner  documentary epics  that was fucking  yeah the hefner  one's great  i have so much  more respect  i never realized  what he did  for all of us  with speech  and language  and yeah  um it was 
[01:55:30]  in the mom's  mabley special  i saw  did i hear that  will be goldberg  did a mom's mabley  documentary  which was really  fucking good  and uh  they talk about  they show  that one's on hbo  a clip of her  singing uh  i'll tell you  that song  it was on hbo  uh john  uh martin  and john martin  and yeah  yeah  or something  is anybody  here  oh yeah  seen my old  friend  can you tell me  where he's got  yeah well 
[01:56:00]  can anybody here  seen my old  friend bobby  can you tell me  where he went  into the kitchen  last night  yeah exactly  he wanted to  grab a roll  but they were  talking about her  they showed a clip  of her singing  that with sammy  davis  and uh  sammy davis jr  and her  it was on  hugh heffner's  fucking show  and they're  sitting there  and he goes  what is that  song he used  to sing  and i thought  oh god  he's leading  her into a bit  but it wasn't  a bit  and then she  stood up  in that little  area  yeah yeah  it was the  shit man  it was just  a cool  party  hip party 
[01:56:30]  looked like  you wanted  to be there  get the right  people together  yeah  i think ron  bennington  could do that  oh yeah  i think ronnie  could get  a man full  of people  command a room  like that  oh yeah  from all walks  of life  and they all  would just  fucking  mingle perfectly  yeah yeah  yeah you get  comics and jazz  people  he would  absolutely  be able to  do that  and the hot  girls weren't  fucking piping  in and being  loud like  hot girls are  and was  fucking  hugh's house  they fucking  paid attention  and shut up  during the  interviews 
[01:57:00]  shut it  our pal  bruce jenner  made the paper  oh no  the paper's  always a day  behind the  internet  that's exactly  what we were  talking about  jenner's  decay  flan  oh i get it  decay flan  boy  doesn't really  make sense  no it makes  no sense at all  they're just  trying for the  wordplay  surgeries turn  olympics hero  into a mess  a mess  yes  well you sure  don't want to  have a lot of  surgery and  be called a mess  and they're just 
[01:57:30]  assholes  it says  uh  chris jenner  denied her  estranged  hubby  wants to  become a  woman  despite his  man boobs  and bizarre  new hair  too  they said  that in  there  wow  former olympian  bruce jenner  has been battling  rumors for years  that he wants  to become a  woman  battling rumors  how do you  battle those  for years  i've never heard  those rumors  unless that's  just the  paper's way  i only heard  about this  recently  appears to  have been  toying with  his appearance 
[01:58:00]  again  uh  he surfers  monday  with a  longer  lighter  and fluffier  hairstyle  it's a  mom hairdo  and it looks  like the  64 year old  reality tv  star's neck  was a little  smoother  after his  reported  adam's apple  surgery  can we just  stop it  what a sick  culture out  there  why isn't he  commenting  i don't know  maybe he likes  the uh  speculation  probably because  he's becoming  a woman  yeah  he wants to  wait until  he's becoming  a woman  that could be 
[01:58:30]  he doesn't want  to say anything  until the hormones  change his voice  yeah  to top it off  it also appears  that the skin  on his face  has been pulled  tight  perhaps the  former athlete  has discovered  a fountain of  youth  the speculation  about his  appearance  perked up  when the father  of six  was photographed  leaving the  beverly hills  surgical center  on january  30th  with bandages  on the front  of his neck  but i mean  you look at  old pictures  of him  what's wrong  with his  adam's apple  i don't know  what's wrong  with anyone's  adam's apple  it's just  there  thank you 
[01:59:00]  if you're a guy  i've said that  a hundred times  oops  but if you're a guy  you don't even  notice  if you're a guy  you don't notice  you have an  adam's apple  do you  it's just there  another photo  showed the  estranged husband  of uh  kardashian  matriarch  chris jenner  with long  manicured nails  yeah  with clear coat  on them  look at his  boobs  his boobs  he's got boobs  look at his  adam's apple  in this picture

[02:00:00]  turquoise  whatever  she goes on  to say  i think when  he gets his  nails buffed  they put  clear nail polish  on  oh that  must be it  why wouldn't  they clip  them  because  first of all  clear nail polish  everyone does  that when they  get a manicure  men do it  too  i see guys  in here  celebrities  in here  always have  the clear  nail polish  long clear  nails  um  no but  this is  still part  of a  manicure  to get  that  done  i have  never  gotten  it  but i  will  you know  what though  if you  gotta come  up with  20  different  excuses

[02:35:00]  yes with the frizzy hair  this is Anne's type though  we all know that  no I like that  Emma Watson  Emma Watson  she looks good  she's not more attractive  than Scarlett Johansson  but yes  Jennifer Lawrence  yes  nothing has  except for the freckles  and the moles  it is a bit over  exposure with her  you think that  unsexy pose  in the fucking  you know what  she doesn't even  look good in that picture  no it's a terrible pose  are you going to tell me  right now  you haven't said anything  it sounds like you  Anthony Comey  are going to say no  to Jennifer Lawrence  no I haven't given her 
[02:35:30]  yes  that would have been  outlandish  yeah that would have  been outlandish  fast forward a few years  though those moles  are going to be  a major problem  on her body  it's the chick  from  hey hey hey  oh yeah  that's a huge yes  oh my god  yes  she's great  that's the blurred lines  yes  does that fit the red bush  no I think that's fake  probably the brownish bush  she's going fake red  I think  she's a car in her back  I like this big girl  looks great right there  alright  now it's number three

[02:39:00]  and February 28th  is Schittsburg  no wonder you're a comedian  yeah  two pickets to  Titsburg  that's you making  a mistake  oh no  see that was  a joke  shit  asshole  shit  shit  climbing the  we're getting  those numbers  hey  hey  hey  hey  hey  hey  hey  my friend  Chris Walsh  who I worked  with at WBAB  for the people  that care  did you bash  him too  I never 
[02:39:30]  bashed Chris  Walsh  did you ever call  Adam by mistake  I remember that  Sam  the dead kid  his father came in  and you  remember  he was just  beheaded  he worked on  the nighttime  attitude  matter of fact  oh  I hope he's  nighttime attitude  and he's on  and he's in the  record business  he's done very  well for himself  over the years  did he put  together the  all request  and dedication  hour  hell no  he did not  that was  Jeff Levine  oh right  there were no  actual songs  being requested  it was a fake  hour  I used to hate  when that 
[02:40:00]  it was a fake  hour  because I felt  like oh  now we can't  do any  material  because it's  the all  request  and dedication  hour  but then we  did it  anyway  of course  he writes  it was on  the news  that Miley  finished way  higher on  the list  the s  men.com  desirable  women's list  but they  stuck her  at 99  as a statement  because they  think she's a  mess  this isn't a  list of who's  a mess  who's fucking  ethical  who's fucking  hot because  they're old 
[02:40:30]  it's a hot list  way to not  understand men  by the way  sometimes you  like a good  mess  in the mix  is there one  fucking list  that's actually  an honest  hot girl list  they always have  to do some  stupid thing  because you put  Miley at  number 99  I guess it's  smart  it gets people  to look at the  rest of the list  it gets everyone  to go why  would you put  Miley number 99  so it gets  people talking  I guess  but it's  stupid  gotta tell you  it says  this was  voted on  oh no  by users  but they admitted 
[02:41:00]  she was hiring  but they put her  at 99  to make a statement  Chris Walsh  would not lie  or Adam Walsh  was it Adam  Walsh  it's Chris  Adam Walsh  John John John  hi John  Johnny John John  I just say that  a lot because I  am one usually  and you have no  idea how awkward  that is because  he actually is  related to the  Walsh  oh see  so you deal  with that  now  I'm sorry  he's really  oh boy  he's almost as 
[02:41:30]  bad as  you deal  with that  shit  is this him  no I don't know  yes there he is  okay  he's coming in  I can hear his  voice  Adam Walsh  hi John  how are you  what did I say  hi John  oh my god  I'm an idiot  Opie and Anthony  will be right back  on Sirius XM  superstar comedian  and late night  TV sensation  Chelsea Handler  is coming to  Sirius XM  Cam and Kanye

[02:53:30]  oh I found a friend  the O.P. and Anthony show  is back  on Sirius XM  hey hey hey 
[02:54:00]  hey hey hey  people pointing out  that Brooklyn Decker  was not on that list  by the way  oh really  Brooklyn Decker  I like the Brooklyn Decker  yeah  what's going on  with this catastrophic  storm in the south  why are they  calling it catastrophic  because it's going to be  an ice storm  and the south  can't handle  freezing  freezing rain  they freak out  down there 
[02:54:30]  but why is it  catastrophic  it's not catastrophic  if you could just  stay home  right  well that's true  but last time  this is a real question  why is it catastrophic  I think they're not  prepared for any of that  then you just tell  everyone to stay home  but if everyone stays home  it's a catastrophe  because then nothing  gets done  one day  I think just the  one day  just them not going  and doing things  right  how bad will it get  is the question  catastrophic  they probably have 
[02:55:00]  power outages  and you know  Atlanta  like a drive  Atlanta's not used  to this shit  emergency services  I bet it's a big  catastrophe  catastrophic though  that's a  a catastrophe  that word is  you shouldn't throw  that one around  a lot  no  what about  dog-a-strophic  then  all right  all right  it's mother nature's  worst kind of storms  that can be inflicted  on the south  that is ice 
[02:55:30]  ice is our biggest enemy  I get  I get why it's going  to be  it's going to suck  it's used the word  catastrophic  catastrophic is like  a nuke going off  in a city  that's a catastrophe  not  not an ice storm  it's going to suck  and people got to be  extremely careful  and cautious  and smart  but to call it  catastrophic  if you could  if you could stay  oh boy  this sounds like a bitch  oh shit  I was just going to say  if you could stay home 
[02:56:00]  and watch  your favorite TV show  it's not catastrophic  it's not catastrophic  like if a nuke goes off  in a city  you're not watching  your favorite show anymore  I think they're figuring  if there's widespread  power outages  and people can't go out  to prepare  get themselves things  right  you know  I was watching some videos  of the people down in Atlanta  and there's certain people  that like those cars  with the real skinny tires  and giant rims  and stuff  and it was one of those cars  trying to drive on the ice  hilarious  it wasn't going anywhere 
[02:56:30]  it was literally  going sideways  down the road  just with the tires  going  so I don't think  they're prepared  for that kind of thing  I got it  I understand that part  let me say hi to Joey  who's calling from Georgia  Joey  good evening  hey Joey  the reason  Anthony's right  the reason  this is catastrophic  is they're talking  maybe four or five days  without power  in North Georgia  happened back in 2000  and caused a lot of problems  we're just not prepared  for this type of weather 
[02:57:00]  you know  it's not very often  but the big concern here  how the hell are you there  sorry sir  we just looked up at Imus  and saw Jimmy Norton  Jimmy Norton  has been cloned  on Imus's show  I can't pop up that audio  he's talking to Warner Wolfe  but  they cloned you Jimmy  but he's here  that's right  I'm really confused  I don't know how that  how that works  look at what an animated boy  oh I wish we could get the audio  Jimmy's hands are moving  he's counting on his fingers  right 
[02:57:30]  Warner Wolfe is looking on  chuckling at Jimmy  look at him laughing  Warner Wolfe is so not approachable though  no  yeah  I mentioned that  you did mention it to him  yeah I said every time  I look at him  he acts like I'm about to attack him  with a hammer  in the gym  because he does  like I see you every day  and we see him every day in the gym  and he's not approachable  not at all  what did he say about that  he left  oh he did left  yeah yeah  he was actually really funny  he's there for a purpose  he seems to be  he's got a purpose  he doesn't seem happy  when he's not  no 
[02:58:00]  not in front of a camera  just my opinion  let's go to the videotape  I really do make love to the camera  oh you certainly do  if the camera has a cock  yeah if the camera has a  yes I got my life  I have to repeat your joke  look Jim Norton shares his experiences  at the gym  are you going  did you talk about the guy  I don't remember if I talked about him  this is a little while ago  yeah  this might have been  when American Degenerate  came out in August  nice we got to get the  the audio clip for the people  we watched it live 
[02:58:30]  we can probably just  yeah we did watch it live  I do remember that  we did  ah we'll do it again  ah what  ah so  Joey so what  so four days without electricity  I guess  that happens though  I remember growing up  Huntington had a massive ice storm  yeah  we were on the national news  and we didn't have power  for close to a week  no  but everyone got through it  yeah I mean  it's just  it's just  not normal for us  to  have ice  and snow  and we don't have  you know  all the salt trucks 
[02:59:00]  that maybe some of the northern states have  you know  we don't have  the equipment  I get  I get you guys  are having a bad storm  but to call it catastrophic  well  you know  maybe I agree with that  but it's  without power these days  for four days  did you lose another tooth  no  no I got  nothing worse than having a little zit  right on the line of your lip  right on the lip line  you're telling yourself  that's what it is  no I swear  like have one right there  on the hole of your cock  that's it huh 
[02:59:30]  no it is  I swear  it's like  oh it hurts though  it's like a million nerves right there  yeah you do that  thanks Joey  you want to go to  clear stuff for it  yeah please  use your special applicator  let's go to China  for real  because of the hand pump  our first phone call  from Shanghai China  what  are you really calling from Shanghai  yes sir  it's currently  10 o'clock  in the evening  no it isn't  how is that possible 
[03:00:00]  it's 9 o'clock in the morning  you dummy  exactly  on a Saturday  the regular manager  shuffled in  regular crowd I mean  yeah for that  the regular manager  shuffled in  sent thorns  and he tried to commit suicide  and still works here  what are you doing in Shanghai China  working in the entertainment industry  out here  bringing out bands  and things like that  we just had a couple bands  come through  we brought the lumineers out here  which was kind of fun  and just doing different things like that 
[03:00:30]  but you know  are you guys  I'll be the youth  for that kind of shit  so  but are you guys  going to bring  the first super group Asia  to China  that would be ironic  it's so funny  I was like  mentioning that to my boss  about you know  how Asia  my fucking boss  yeah  what  yeah  that's right  you got to pay the cost  to be the boss  to bring Asia  out here anyway  but I said  we could get the whole market  locked down  but he told me  that Chinese kids  don't listen to anything  past you know  the year 2005 
[03:01:00]  and if it's not from  fucking Great Britain  or anything like that  it doesn't work  but yeah  how about you tell him  to stop being so picky  really  some good shit out there  well  I mean  we need you guys  we need Jimmy Norton  to come out here  and probably  weigh some Chinese chip-isms  on him  or something like that  Chinese chips  I'm sure my humor  would be very well received there  yes  hey  are you  are you  are you Asian  I'm not Asian  do you speak Chinese  a little bit 
[03:01:30]  a little bit  every  I studied in college  but it doesn't really  doesn't really  do well  once you're in China  do you keep your hand  over your coke  the whole time you're there  that is so fucking funny  I mean  I want to go in  and just talk about  how the  no we want to know  about Shanghai  a little bit  where are you from  originally 
[03:02:00]  I'm originally  from Wichita  Kansas  that's just like Shanghai  of course  and how long  have you been  in Shanghai  about three years  three years  so you're the  so for three years  in a row  you've won  the biggest  cock in town  contest  butch Bradley  he lives out here  and he's a comedian  who's on Comedy Central  and he's  oh yeah yeah  I know who Bush is  why is he living in Shanghai 
[03:02:30]  he works for expats  he does like shows  yeah yeah  he runs this  he works for this thing  called Kung Fu Comedy  and he's the only comedian  to actually get a fucking  salary out here  I actually did my first  my first stand up  ever last night  at an open mic  and all of a sudden  he runs in  and gets a slot  in front of me  so I had to follow him  he basically  intimidated a crowd  of Chinese people  and this one  Turkish ex  that guy  and he was basically  like following the  fucking manager  manager of a TGI Friday 
[03:03:00]  is on a bad day  or something like that  what do you mean  did he not do well  no no  it's not that he didn't  do well  but like  I mean  god damn  I mean how many times  I mean  I don't know if you guys  are used to this  well since you run  this radio show  I mean like  just making fun of people  all the time  and that was his entire bit  just improvising  and I mean  so making fun of this  fucking Chinese kid  like not  wearing  I mean like  a matching coat  to his like  fucking  like pants  or something like that 
[03:03:30]  it was ridiculous  but did the crowd like it  I mean  well the expats did  I mean it was probably  like a 75% expat crowd  like it was 25% Chinese  but uh  okay  I mean yeah  they got into it I guess  but it was all you know  like shock value  kind of shit  I mean  that transcends  a lot of you know  good comedy out here  if you can  you know  make people  like scream  you know  and get them  liquored up basically  it's kind of like  how the shit was  back in the 80s  so is Butch  is Butch living there  I don't know him that 
[03:04:00]  sorry to interrupt you  but I don't know Butch  that well  but I do know him  is he living out there  full time now  uh yeah  actually he is  uh he may do some gigs  here and there  I know that he did  um  he did like  shows for the troops  like he you know  did shows in Afghanistan  and shows in Iraq  and stuff  the other side  Al Qaeda  I believe he is  living here  for some time now  yeah  I don't know  it's kind of interesting  I mean  you know  like I was mentioning  he's like  kind of like how it was  in the 1980s  in the US 
[03:04:30]  when there's this big  stand up boom  going on  it's kind of the same  thing that they're  trying to do out in China  but it's you know  the same thing  working in the  entertainment industry  and bringing bands out  it's like  how do you connect  with what the kids  actually want  without entirely  pulling in  just expats  you know  and actually getting  Chinese kids  to come to shows  and you know  that culture is so different  how do you even know  what the fuck  music translates  comedy is a different  it's a different energy  and it's a different  place in your brain  that it hits  that's why music  is so popular 
[03:05:00]  because you know  you can listen to one song  in ten countries  they'll all like it  right  one joke  doesn't work  state to state  so  if you don't know  the language  how do you get around  is it that difficult  well I mean  there are  yeah  sorry go ahead  I was going to just say  is it that difficult  just going to a restaurant  or whatever  I bet they speak  a lot of English  you think  in Shanghai  Shanghai is a lot  of expats  it's probably like  the most  I mean  the most foreigner  like  dwelling city  in China  I mean  I used to come here 
[03:05:30]  a lot  my dad does a little  bit of business  out here  I've come with him  a couple times  and  like I studied  Chinese for a little  while in college  but even then  you know  you come out  and  it's a matter of  like  you know  you go to different  parts of China  and they speak  a different  you know  dialect  everybody speaks  Mandarin  you know  what they speak  back in  you know  in Beijing  because  that's the edict  that Mao instilled  when you know  the Communist Party  came to power  but even in Shanghai  there are people  that don't speak  the national  you know  language  which they speak 
[03:06:00]  Shanghai  it's almost like  Creole essentially  hey you ever go to  you ever go to  Hong Kong  how is it  how is it  it's a cool city  but like  there's a lot of  a lot of  white  way too much  yeah  I mean  living in a cage  basically  I've never been there  I heard something  though once  that  one time  I think it was 
[03:06:30]  only once  that  King Kong  went there  right  yeah  and  I think  he was playing  ping pong  what  over there  yeah in Hong Kong  what he used  he apparently  used his  ding dong  oh  now that's what  I heard  why did he use a panel  and I just want  to know  if that's true  so  so  so you called  because you guys  got two inches  of snow  in Shanghai  China  yeah 
[03:07:00]  we got two inches  I mean  not  it didn't even  collect on the ground  it was essentially  sleet  right  and  sleet  I mean  hold on a minute  it just never  ends  yeah  he's like  yeah  phone calls  tend to be  herky jerky  on the show  yes they do  a lot of herky jerky  yes  you were saying  so there's sleet  or shreet  yes  on the roads  then what happened  they didn't even  they didn't fucking  stick on the ground 
[03:07:30]  but like  all these businesses  closed  and like  because  you know  my roommate  speaks Chinese  and just because  big fucking whoop  really  he lives there  so people in Atlanta  complain about  two inches of snow  piling up  but the Chinese  I mean  Shanghai's people  are a bit more  whiny  you go to other  parts of China  and they know  how to fucking  who knew  survive  I thought it was  all the same  of course  I always think that  but I finally get it  with the ice in Atlanta  I used to point and laugh  to those people  but they just don't have 
[03:08:00]  anything  they don't have the resources  for that  they don't want to spend  the money on that shit  because this is so rare  for down there  I guess it's 58,000 power  outages in Atlanta  right now  and it's you know  moving through  that's not catastrophic  no it's not  flights canceled  2,500 plus  total flights canceled  ahead of the storm  0.92 inches  1.1 inches  0.02 inches  this is nothing  of ice or snow 
[03:08:30]  or sleet  lava  actually  it's very  that is catastrophic  okay  yes  I get it now  a lot  thank you  Aggie  maybe if I had  some lava  hey  no problem  I'm glad  to get on here  wait how are you  listening to our show  Aggie  is that your name  Aggie  you listen to your show  yeah live  through pal talk  actually  is this Ralph Aggie  oh my god  fucking Ralph Aggie  no no no  it's not Ralph Aggie  Ralph fucking Aggie

[03:25:30]  a guy that would  be into sports  though  well I grew up  in Pittsburgh  and I did  until I was 12  and then Bobby  Bonilla left  the pirates  for more money  and it was like  it was like  a fucking  dramatic movie  moment  like I tore  all the posters  off my wall  and I cried  fuck you  and I literally  was like  I realized  I think most  grown ups  don't have  this realization  but I was like  oh athletes  don't give a  fuck about me  oh they don't  care about me  my city  my pride  yeah like  I care so much  and they don't  care  you get this  ridiculous  loyalty to your  fucking team 
[03:26:00]  and then you realize  yeah they'll just  go on to the  yeah  nothing better than  when your team  wins a championship  and the next year  everyone's gone  yeah  exactly  they just all  bust the team up  when we were  growing up  that didn't happen  you were stuck  with the same team  year after  fucking year  but that built  the loyalty  right  but if you knew  you had a shitty team  you knew  you were in deep  trouble for many  many years though  yeah  my dad's  favorite  he was  you grew up  in Pittsburgh  too  Smokey Burgess  was like the  catcher  or whatever  and then that  fucking dude  just like  opened a restaurant  in Pittsburgh  like you can go  and hang out 
[03:26:30]  that's it  with the guy  you can hang out  with Smokey  yeah exactly  and then like  so that's like  kind of the mentality  I had growing up  was like oh this is  great  that's how it's  gonna go  and then Bobby  just fucking  took off on me  well that's probably  what sent them  out of here  if I don't  fucking get out  of here now  I'm gonna have  a restaurant  like Smokey Burgess  and be stuck here  hearing their  dumb sports stories  I really  as an adult  I have re-evaluated  that and going  like that makes  all the sense  of the world  from his perspective  you know what I mean  like why the fuck  would you stick  around in Pittsburgh  what's going on Smokey  you know 
[03:27:00]  Smokey Smokey  Smokey  let me tell you  about the time  I was at that game  when you  oh fuck this  that does sound brutal  yeah  and the only reason  he was able to do that  is because they  didn't pay him  right  poor Smokey  yeah  if Smokey was playing  today he wouldn't  be opening up  no fucking restaurant  after he retired  well the Yankees  signed what's his name  that fucking pitcher  from Japan right  and he had his  press conference  yesterday  what's his name again  Tanaka  Tanaka  Tanaka  one of those  yeah they're hoping  he's a little better  than a Rabu  that didn't work out 
[03:27:30]  very well  but he can't  depressing ending  but he rented a  was it a 7  787  787  but they're saying  he might have just  been given that  by Japan Airlines  as a source  of national pride  he flew over  on a JAL  787  it cost $195,000  for him to come over  to sign the contract  like his family  a couple of people  it was like 8 people  and his toy poodle  and then they  uh oh  that's mysterious  I think so  thank you  and then they  immediately crash  into a boat  in Hawaii  damn 
[03:28:00]  his wife's a pop star  or some shit too  so there's probably  two giant celebrities  they don't want to deal  with anybody  and they've probably  got a good deal  and he's got the toy poodle  yeah  I don't want to regret  I don't want to eat  fucking poodles  that dog I will not  yeah they always  yell to love  might be the wife's  might be the wife's poodle  they said it was  his toy poodle  well  he's all about  his toy poodle  that's a dumb  fucking dog  for a man to have  I mean I have a tiny  shitty little gay dog 
[03:28:30]  but he's a fun  he's half pug  and half chihuahua  it's like  it looks  it's insane looking  like he has this  let's look the shit up  and chihuahua  it's called a chug  and the way they look  every time you look at him  he's so adorable  but it's like  what a fucking group  of monsters we are  that we did that  to dogs  let's breed it together  with this  yeah we all were  kind of fucking  Dr. Frankenstein-ish  yeah and every time  he's shitty  I'm just like  I'm going to leave you  in the woods  fucking good luck  you know what I mean  because that dog  wouldn't survive  for a minute  he wouldn't do well  in the woods  no  not meant for the wild  no 
[03:29:00]  is it nervous  like a chihuahua  does it shake  no see that's the best part  is like pugs  are like lazy as shit  and chihuahuas  are really high strung  so it kind of mellows  it's like right in the middle  that's nice  oh I got it  do you know like  how pugs  where they came from  it's fascinating  like they're from China  but this like  some insane  Chinese emperor  like six centuries ago  he literally  he was like  I want a dog  that looks like a monkey  and so that's what he did  so like some just  fucking despot  sitting there  was just like  bring me a monkey dog  you know  and then they just like  kept making things fuck 
[03:29:30]  until they got it right  until the nose  got all fucked  let me see  that's exactly  that's adorable  it's super adorable  that's crazy  that's not what it would be that cute  why would you say  it's a gay dog  well cause he's like  six pounds  you know what I mean  yeah  fuck your three grown men  just went  oh look at him  he's adorable  that's crazy  thank you Jim  exactly  wow that's pretty crazy  cute dog  no that's a  that's a nice looking dog  we are a little crazy  about like breeding  animals to make  like I want this 
[03:30:00]  yeah  so put those together  something nature probably  would never throw together  and I bet the first go around  with that experiment  they really tried to get a dog  and a monkey to fuck each other  you know what I mean  like they're just sweating bullets  cause they're like  he needs a monkey dog  how do we make that happen  they come back  the monkey's laying there  with his throat ripped out  yeah  or the fucking monkey  just jerking off  throwing his cum on the dog  he doesn't get it  old multiple mix monkey  he barked at you  what did he say  not to regress the conversation 
[03:30:30]  but I did stand up in Shanghai  I was there for a week  why would you go there  cause it was like a month long tour  just cause you know  I don't own a home  but I wrote jokes about my cock  and people would fly me to Hong Kong  and see Shanghai  so I was like why not  you know what I mean  that's cool  that's like one of those places  that's an Indiana Jones-ish  yeah yeah yeah  Shanghai look at it  exactly and I thought  this was such a great story 
[03:31:00]  cause it really is like  what you were asking the dude  about speaking English  like nobody speaks English there  I thought so  that's fucking crazy  but someone wrote us  and said 300 million people  speak English in China  no it's 600,000  there's 600,000 expats  that live there  so that's the whole community  in Shanghai or China  in Shanghai  okay  so there's like an English  radio station  what's that?  what?  I actually didn't hear you  sorry  I was talking over  what did you say  I didn't hear the huge  are you gonna  expats  I didn't think  I heard you 
[03:31:30]  fucking right here  see I  what I  no  shit  so anyway  the thing that was so great  is that we had this dude  who like took us around  on a tour  like he was like  a Chinese guy  but he was born in America  so he spoke English  and Mandarin fluently  so he was our dude  that's what he does  he takes  he's like a liaison  to celebrities  or whatever  not that we're celebrities 
[03:32:00]  but you know  so he told us  this amazing story  about some tennis player  like some like  hot young famous  tennis player  like I don't know  who it was  Barthar Ash  yeah yeah  yeah  that gentleman  that's how we got AIDS  the emperor made him  fuck a monkey  oh man  anyway  that's where we got AIDS  we fucked monkeys  anyway  so here's what  so he  they have  he's taking this tennis player  around  and he's there for like  three weeks or whatever  and he brought some  like twatty  like model girlfriend 
[03:32:30]  with him  who had like  zero appreciation  for other people's cultures  you know what I mean  it was just like  this place is weird  and they smell gross  inconvenient  where's McDonald's  you know  like that kind of shit  you know  and he was mostly busy  doing Prescott  so he was  the tour guide  was like stuck with her  the whole time  oh wow  she was just such a pain  in his dick  like just being a twat  you know  if you're not getting laid  that is really fucking  yeah  then you have nothing  to gain by putting up  with her  right  so after like a week  or two  she was like  you know what  the guy's name was Dan  she's like  you know what Dan  fuck this 
[03:33:00]  like I can do this  by myself  like I'm a model  I've been to Paris  I know what I'm doing  and he's like  oh boy  listen that's not a good idea  don't do that  and she's like  seriously Dan  I know what I'm doing  but she's like  such a pain in the balls  that eventually  like he's like  fine go ahead  fuck yourself  right  so then this  half of the story  is related by the police  she ends up  walking around  she ends up  in one of those  real deal markets  in Shanghai  where they're like  fucking  like old ladies  are like  inspecting eels  like you do  with watermelons  you know what I mean  like that kind of shit  and she sees 
[03:33:30]  a guy  with a cage  full of puppies  right  so she's like  aw  there's puppies here  she's like  we're gonna  I'm gonna rescue  one of these puppies  we're gonna have it  it's gonna be our hotel puppy  for the next three weeks  here in Shanghai  right  oh no  so she goes over to the guy  and there's no  verbal communication  but just with like  hand signals or whatever  she's like  I would like that puppy  sir  oh no  and he's like  which puppy do you mean  and she's like  that one  the cutest one  I want the cutest puppy  and he's like  you mean this one 
[03:34:00]  and she's like  yes  that's the one  he takes it out of the cage  pulls it out  snaps its neck  and hands it to her  she had like  a fucking nervous breakdown  they had like  the cops had to be called  they like  threw a riot blanket over  or whatever  you know what I mean  take her back to the  yeah  it's like pointing to a fucking lobster  in a tank  that's exactly what it was like  yeah  so they really eat dogs over there  fuck  yeah  Jesus Christ  you can't like  really get it  but I know they eat dogs  I guess what I meant  it's that open  yeah yeah  in a market  you could grab a dog 
[03:34:30]  to bring home to eat  yeah  totally  that's not  fucked up  it's nothing fucking  it would be like  somebody getting  freaked out  that you went and  bought a steak  at a fucking  grocery store  or imagine if they came  imagine we're going somewhere  and seeing people  keeping chickens  as house pets  and walking them  and fucking you know  snuggling with them  in bed  and chickens  and man  you'd be like  what an asshole culture  that's what they probably  think of us  putting little  fucking fools  putting little sweaters  on them  yeah exactly  their little feet warm  stepping in their shit  and living with that 
[03:35:00]  and accepting it  India with the cows  obviously right  you know  did you guys  that's ridiculous  you see the giraffe story  where they killed the giraffe  in front of everybody  right  yeah  holy fuck  at the zoo  they said that  they did it  because they didn't want  inbreeding  amongst the giraffes  so they were going to  feed the giraffe  to the big cats  the giraffes are stuck  in a zoo  for the rest of their lives  who cares if they're inbred  exactly  they're already having  a shitty life  it puts out  some fucked up giraffes  if you do that 
[03:35:30]  but  wouldn't you want to see  a fucked up giraffe  so they shoot it  I would love to see  an inbred giraffe  what is that  it's got a short neck  or something  look at the Toys R Us one  so they did that  they shot it  in front of these kids  hacked it up  into pieces  and then threw it  into the big cat cage  why couldn't they do  all that  behind the  I don't know  they wanted to show  the kids  they said they wanted  to show  they give people  appreciation of the giraffe  I guess the physical  elements of it  when they peeled it 
[03:36:00]  or whatever  but they shot it  in the belly  so it could roll around  thinking it over  you've been shot  in the gut  as opposed to good  you think you could  watch that  wow  somebody shoot a giraffe  I would be out of my mind  I would be sad  or something  I don't like that  I would have  I'd rather see it strangled  40 or 50 people  that's totally  how you get rid of a giraffe  you giant beheaded  a bunch of people  with a belt  picking sides 
[03:36:30]  for a softball team  yeah  until you get to the top  finally get to the top  that is pretty sick  in the world  zaniest guillotine  I wouldn't  like a sausage grinder  but it's a guillotine  Americans  we love our animals  we don't like  when other cultures  fuck with animals  what was extra fucked up  is apparently  a couple zoos  offered to take them  that's the weird thing  they were like  don't do that  because then there wouldn't be  an inbreeding issue  if you moved them  to another zoo  they were like  we really want to shoot them 
[03:37:00]  we would really want to  shoot them and hack them up  and throw them  at the fucking tigers  I offered to take him  my apartment  make him a pet  just try to teach him  to stay down  duck  you know how much  a giraffe would hate  my apartment  banging his head  be all mopey  be great  you could drive him  he'd stick out your sunroof  like Dino  yeah  exactly  I could close it  then you hit him  in the underpass  problem solved  he executed it anyway  poor thing 
[03:37:30]  we love our animals  I didn't know there's usually  a volunteer to take them  that's kind of sad  yeah that was fucked up  fuck that zoo  poor lull guy  poor lull guy  where was it  where was that anyway  some savage nation  or was it  Belgium or somewhere like that  or Denmark  supposedly civilized  it was somewhere around there  that's supposed to be  civilized though  what else about Shanghai  I like hearing about  other places  I really do  but not the boring shit  that Travel Channel gives you  right  it was some weird shit  you saw in Shanghai  oh you know 
[03:38:00]  you go around  people just accost you  all the time  they try to sell you  bullshit  you know what I mean  like little electronic  nonsense or watches  or whatever  and so I went there  and there was this  it was amazing  it was the tackiest thing  I've ever seen  but it was a watch  and it was like  there was like a samurai  and he was going down  on like a geisha  looking thing  and the tongue  was the second hand  and I was like  I need that fucking watch  that is incredible  so I tell Dan  the guy who speaks Chinese 
[03:38:30]  I was like  get me that watch  and he's like  how much you want to pay for it  and I was like  I don't know  whatever  like 10 bucks  I can't imagine  15, 20  so he's like  alright  so he starts talking to the lady  and I'm watching this  and it just implodes immediately  he's like  ga ga ga  and then she's like  ga ga ga  and he's like  ga ga ga ga  ga ga ga  and then she fucking  pulls out a broom  and starts swinging at it  and I'm like  what the fuck just happened  right  we go like running down the  and I was like  what the fuck went down  and he's like  she wanted like 22 bucks for that  and I was like  you motherfucker  like I would have totally  fine  yeah  and I was like 
[03:39:00]  let's go back  and he's like  no no  I called her a cunt  we can't go back  he's trying to save you  two lousy dollars  I know  I know  exactly  come on  my brother lived there  for a while  my brother's like  fluent Mandarin  and he's kind of a badass  he was like an army ranger  and everything  oh yeah  wow  so he and a group  I thought this is a great story  he and a group of dudes  they went on a horseback riding trip  in western China  like way the fuck  in the middle of nowhere  like over by Tibet  right  and they have this like  tiny little bullshit town  and they go in  and there's like  this little tavern 
[03:39:30]  it's really like  old Wessie  you know  so they go in this little tavern  and there's this like  wormy little Chinese guy  who runs the place  and he like slithers up to them  they're sitting at the bar  or like at the bar  and he goes  he goes alright  first  we have tea  then  beer  then  surprise  and then he like  scuttles away  and I'm like  what the fuck  so  the guy comes over  and my brother is like  I don't know what the fuck  the tea was about  there was no  he never brought tea  so  so just like  pictures of beer  and then  at about like  an hour or two later  he goes  okay 
[03:40:00]  now  surprise  and he takes him  into this like  back room  that's just like a  like a weird  giant concrete bunker  and all it has  it's enormous  it's this giant bunker  and there's one little couch  and like a throw rug  and a karaoke machine  and the guy  just turns it on  and starts singing karaoke  my brother  and his two ranger buddies  sitting on the couch  you know what I mean  he's just singing karaoke to him  and they're like  that's fantastic  is this a surprise  because  yeah I'm surprised  I wouldn't have guessed that 
[03:40:30]  then the guy goes over  and he bangs on a door  that's on the other side  and like  a half dozen  like fucking  teenage girls  come out  like younger  like  unfortunately  very young  and he's like  you  yeah he's like  you choose  like so that's the surprise  right  and they're like  oh this motherfucker  you know what I mean  like so  the three of them  and they're  like my brother's jacked  like the other two  were all  and so  they're like  you know what  fuck this guy  and so they go over to him  and he's like  choose  about the teenagers 
[03:41:00]  you know  and they go  no no  we'd rather fuck you  how much is it to fuck you  and the guy's like  I don't know  you choose  and they're like  no no no  I understand  but we want to fuck you  how much does that cost  and the guy's like  no no you choose girl  and they're like  no no  we're gonna fuck you  and that's when it sunk in  that like  he's surrounded by these three dudes  who are like four times the size  and he was just like  you go now  you know  turned into one of those things  and he like literally  chased him out with a broom again  same thing  did the girls  when they said that  did the girls go 
[03:41:30]  probably  I'm sure  probably  I imagine that  and I get a little hard on  thinking about it  but  that is the only way they giggle  yes  yeah  why did your brother live there  he was perfecting Mandarin  basically  that's why he went  so  is there shit to do though  is it cool  or is it  oh yeah yeah  it's amazing  it's really cool  well that sounds  like a fun experience  sure  yeah  but yeah  it's really cool  I mean there's whores everywhere 
[03:42:00]  like not in China so much  but like in Malaysia  there's  we went there on the tour too  and it's just  every  every female is a hooker  like they're all  it's crazy  are they pretty  or  I'm not a big fan of Chinese girls  I mean I  I was engaged at the time  so I behaved myself  not that I would have just  probably fucked a  random Malaysian whore anyway  but  you know at least  one of his  fucking ranger buddies  was like  yeah  well fuck you  yeah  god I want to  fuck that girl  on the right  I want to fuck that girl  I want to fuck that girl  yeah sir 
[03:42:30]  you horrible man  you can  one guy  just had to go along  right right  fuck man  damn near me  good surprise  they chase him out  with a broom  he comes back  I'll take the one on the left  yeah do attack  that one  do-gooder  right  do-gooder  he's a stick in the mud  speaking of which  does she allow that  stick in the mud  I went  I was on the tour  with a buddy  Keith Albert 
[03:43:00]  he's a really funny guy  you know Keith  yeah  he's been on Letterman  a couple times  anyway  he's just such a goober though  he's from Tennessee  he's like this real sweetheart  kind of a guy  you know he's just  like he's unaware of  darkness in the world  so he didn't even know  they were hookers  you know  oh wow  yeah  and he was somehow  I call him Malaysian  horror repellent  because he has so  he has no game  to the point  where Malaysian hookers  were coming up to me  going like  what's wrong with your friends  oh man  that's that  it was pretty great  they'd probably never say that 
[03:43:30]  yeah yeah  exactly right  because they'll just sit  in your lap  like you and I  by the time  this whole conversation  we would have had  14 hookers in our lap  over the course  of this conversation  yeah  like the second  you sit down  one of them comes up  and just sits in your lap  and starts playing  with your hair  and it's like  I like you  when do they give up  on it all  how many minutes  do they give you  to decide  before they're like  oh fuck it  I gotta find another lap  it is that kind of  annoying like stripper  thing  where it's like  you know you don't  want a lap dance  from the girl  but you still have to  be polite  and engage in this  dumb conversation  for three minutes 
[03:44:00]  before she pulls  the trigger  and goes  do you want a lap dance  so where are you from  what do you do  what do you do  because for some reason  you don't want to  hurt their feelings  yeah yeah yeah  exactly  so you have to engage  in this dumb  two minute conversation  with someone who speaks  almost no English  just like  I like you  and it's like  what do we like  about each other  so far  you know  it's just like that  you know  it's like  you're from America  it's like yeah  it's like  what do you know  about America  you know  it's just impossible  she likes 330 million  people  yeah  dumb Malaysian  hooker  but that's 
[03:44:30]  yeah  that's what it's  like really  so  where else  did you go on the tour  Shanghai  Malaysia  Singapore  Hong Kong  that's where the tour was  Singapore is strict  yeah well we were  talking about that  the last time  that's right  we were talking  about the caning  and we watched that shit  and everything  that's right  you told us  the story of watching that  fuck I remember  okay  no shenanigans  over there  what's that  he deserved it  that kid  that kid that  got caned over there  yeah  what was he doing  he spray painted cars  because that's the thing  I knew him 
[03:45:00]  you know what I mean  that was why we got  he played against us  in baseball as a kid  but that takes balls  to spray paint a parking lot  full of cars  in Singapore  no one literally  gets you that shit  like why would you  that is nuts  how many did you get  if you fly into the  oh we did the Philippines too  if you fly into the Philippines  or Singapore  they're two of those countries  that like do not fuck around  you know what I mean  like Malaysia's fine  it's friendly  and whatever  and like China's  relatively friendly  they want westerners  to visit and stuff 
[03:45:30]  but if you go to  you know how most  when you fly into an airport  there's a great big sign  that says like  welcome to France  or whatever  you know like  bonjour  or whatever  in Singapore  or the Philippines  when you walk in  there's no like  hey glad you're here  it's literally like  here's what we'll execute you for  oh shit  it's like a list of like  if you do these things  that's great  we will cut your fucking head off  do you remember some of the things  wow  well it's like  most of it's like drug related  you know what I mean  they don't like drug shit  and it's like  I've never done drugs  like I was an alcoholic  but I've never  but it literally makes you go 
[03:46:00]  like me  like I never have done a drug  in my life  but I took a minute to go like  do I have coke  I really want to make sure  I don't have any coke on me  would they arrest you  if you brought in coke  oh fuck  Jimmy  that's why I love that show  Locked Up Abroad  I love watching  I fucking love that show  but the first 50 minutes  it's only the last 10 minutes  where it's locked up abroad  the first 50 minutes  of that show  should be called  It's So Cool Being a Drug Smuggler 
[03:46:30]  because they show like  the greatest life  these guys are flying  it's like  I almost got caught  the adrenaline rush  they make it through  the first few times  they're partying  money, girls  adventure  and then they get caught  it's like  oh here's the bad part  the last 10 minutes  the first fucking 50 minutes  this is the greatest life ever  flying all over the world  with drugs  excitement, intrigue  going to exotic places  yes  that show  I love that show  that came out  in 2009 or whatever  I got married in 2010 
[03:47:00]  and that show  really made me  question being married  because I was like  dude if we ever go somewhere  and we get fucking  arrested together  I'm so fucked  if you have a wife with you  you know what I mean  you can't  if you're on your own  you can punch the guy  and try to get away  there's something  but it's like  if you have some  fucking broad with you  the whole time  you know what I mean  the anchor  then especially my ex-wife  it was like  there's no way  she's going to be able  to escape  fucking Ecuador  with me  run  make a break for it  where are you going 
[03:47:30]  I always thought about that  every time I watched one of those  I was like  oh it just sucked  because a lot of them  are stuck with their life  it's hard to accept  a free vacation  from the Medellin cartel  and not think  they're going to want  something back from you  and they just wanted  to bring me to Columbia  and sit me poolside  for no reason  they really do a good job  of making the viewer  nervous on that show  I was watching one  and the person  was approached  by some friend  here in the states  or in England  wherever it was  and it's like 
[03:48:00]  alright we need you  to just take  it's going to be easy  you just take some cocaine  we have it all figured out  it's in the luggage  it's hidden  no one sees it  and they're like  alright I'm going to do it  they go over there  these shady guys show up  with like bricks of coke  that are obviously  poking through the luggage  and they're like  I can't  I can't take this through  no you take this through  at this point  it's too late  they're like  this is just obvious  how do I do this  I'm fucked  and I'm watching  going oh man  I'm fucked  oh wait  I'm home 
[03:48:30]  this is good  you get all nervous  right  yeah yeah yeah  they just made him  a beard of cocaine  you know what  the ones that make me  uncomfortable  I love the ones  where it's like  the drug  because there's  there's two kinds  or there's actually  three kinds  there's the drug smuggler  kind  there's the guy  who was doing nothing  who just got fucked  kind  and then there's the  like tourists  who get caught up  by rebel groups  which doesn't even count  because that's not even  part of the  you know what I mean  like I feel like  that's not really  locked up abroad  yeah yeah  that's like hostage 
[03:49:00]  kidnapped hostage  but I feel really  uncomfortable with the guys  who didn't do anything  like the coke smugglers  it's like well good  motherfucker  yeah you were trying  to pull one over on him  it's like  there's a  like a poetic justice  to it  right  like they learned  a lesson or something  yeah  but the guy who's just  like mistaken  for another guy  and gets fucked  there was one  foreign prison  I think it was like  Ecuador  did you ever see  the one where the  dude escapes prison  and like he didn't  do anything  and he just got fucked  and it's like  his wife got killed  or some crazy shit 
[03:49:30]  and yeah  and he spent like  18 years in this prison  and then he snuck out  like and he  he prepared all this  shit smuggled  into him over years  dressed like a woman  yeah dressed like a woman  and he lost his razor  that's the  he's like in this  running or whatever  he had like a full on  beard  and somehow the razor  fell out of his  like little fucking  plastic bag  so he gets this rest area  and he's supposed to be  dressed like a woman  but he's got like a  fucking duck dynasty beard  so he starts like  literally ripping it out 
[03:50:00]  with his hands  holy fuck  that's what he had to do  is rip his own  fucking beard out  with his just fist  it's amazing what people  will do  yeah  did he get a good shave  circumstance  no  because it was all  bloody  I answered that  no Jim  he did not  you can't  you can't shave  with your fist  no  you can certainly  wipe your ass  with it though  thank god  that's fucked up  so he had like  clumps  bloody fucking  missing pieces 
[03:50:30]  of flesh or whatever  and so he had to  abandon the  because it was  all time sensitive  so then basically  he just had to walk  with like a book  really close to his face  and that's how he got  and he went back  to prison  because they caught him  with the book  because he's a dude  or a chick with a beard  oh man  and then when he was  in prison that time  he lost his eye  somebody fucking  like gouged his eye out  in the prison shower  fucking  and he just  he didn't do anything  he was just fucked  yeah like after  he'd served his sentence  like 22 years  wow  like so it's not even like  there's no happy ending 
[03:51:00]  to me at all  no he served his  fucking term  yeah he did his whole time  lost an eye  Jesus  had to rip his own beard out  I saw one where a guy  had to dress like a woman  it was pretty fucking cool  a woman was helping him  do this  bringing in clothes  and hiding it  yeah yeah  and then they had to go  through this visitor thing  where  because he was going to leave  dressed as a woman  that the prison officials  thought was visiting  somebody else  oh right  so he needed  these various  tokens  and badges  and stuff  that had to be made  and then swapped 
[03:51:30]  on a line  with three  successive security guys  it was very involved  right  and he actually  they counterfeited  all these things  really well  and then when he  walked out of the cell  he looked right in the face  this guy he had gotten  in a fight with  another prisoner  and the guy  looked at him  with recognition  it's like  you're just like a woman  and he thought  this guy's going to rat me out  but the guy  kind of just  smiled and nodded at him  like  I can't stand you  but  I gotta give you 
[03:52:00]  this one  that's really cool  the guy didn't rat him out  no no  I guess that's punishable  by death in prison  if you rat a guy  who's about to escape  oh yeah  did he make it  yeah he made it out  made it out  and they do things  like where  they show the guard  looking at him  in the eyes  looking at the paperwork  and you know  that probably didn't happen  of course  not even looking at him  yeah go  was it a shitty  African place  or a shitty  South American place  it was a shitty  South American place  or a shitty  East Asian place  yes  let's go to  Brother Joe

[04:19:30]  how cartoonish  their strategy  is  like they go  you know  he does  his first  time  in  Israel  and so  they sit  down  and they're  like  okay  my friend  so how many  times have you  been to Israel  and he's like  I've never been  here before  it's my first  time  and they're like  okay  very good  they're like  where are you  from  and he's like  I'm from  New York  in the United  States  and they're like  so the last  time you were  here  was it very  different  wait a minute  I just said  I wasn't here  before  and they're like  oh yes  yes  my bad  you did say  that  you were 
[04:20:00]  trying to  trip me  up  what is your  mom's maiden  name  it's like  oh it's  McDonald  so did you  notice how  we put in  a new  since the  last time  you  it's like  motherfucker  I get what  you're doing  you're not  going to get  me on this  fucking loophole  yeah but he  wasn't hiding  if you're  hiding something  I'll bet you  they took  because those  motherfuckers  was it LL  airlines  I don't know  what airlines  they are the  they are the  best man  they don't care  about your  feelings  so last time  you were here  yeah I made  Johnny Ola  took me there  oh fuck  damn it 
[04:20:30]  stupid Fredo  Johnny loves  these players  alright we get it  fucking idiots  Michael's like  I think he was  more disappointed  how dumb his  brother was  than actually  being a traitor  he said it  twice  Johnny Ola  show me  Johnny  Dumb mustache  fucking awful  hairline  hey Freddy  Corleone  getting off the  whole Italian  thing  asshole  we're discussing  what an asshole  Fredo was  fine  great  what year is  this 
[04:21:00]  people have  seen the  godfather 2  it's an amazing  motion picture  interesting fact  about that  a little factoid  I don't have one  I think we did  everything today  oh man  anything else  on your mind  Jesse Joyce  I go to Canada  a lot  and did you know  that if you  this might be  specifically for  Ant  do you ever  get a DUI  no  as a matter of  fact I knock  wood every time  I say that  good for you 
[04:21:30]  I am a very  good drunk driver  yeah  I used to think  that  Jimmy's like  yeah right  until you're not  well that's  I don't drive  drunk anymore  what do you mean  you used to think  that what happened  well because I  got out  I mentioned this  on the show  before but I  got out of  five previous DUIs  that's gotta be  a record  and then the  sixth one is  the one that  got but I  the whole time  and I blackout  drunk drove  across four states  I told you  about that  and so like  all of that  shit made me  go like  oh dude  it was amazing  because most  people were like  oh so that's  why you quit  and I was like  absolutely not 
[04:22:00]  that convinced  me I'm the  best drunk driver  of all time  exactly  I'm fucking  great at this  you really don't  remember being in  four states  not a fucking  minute of it  not a minute of  that drive  I was convinced  when I woke up  in the hotel  that I was still  stuck in Kentucky  like I had not  left  you woke up  in a hotel  and realized  you were four  states over  I realized  it took me  a minute  to figure out  I was in  a different hotel  wow  is that fucked up  like I went  to bed  to the best  of my knowledge  I passed out  like I went  to bed  in the one hotel  and so  when I woke up  I was like 
[04:22:30]  fuck I'm late  back to the hotel  and then I was like  holy shit  I made it  how far of a drive  was it  like 10 hours  oh my god  no recollection  at all  even when you  started really  thinking about it  I fucking drove  through a rush  hour somewhere  I got gas  at some point  no idea  yeah  it was fascinating  to me  like I went  out to my car  and it was like  kind of askew  in a parking  space  but I did it  I made the whole  drive  like I checked  thoroughly  to make sure  there was  exactly  scratches  like a pink  bicycle  or whatever  yeah  the little 
[04:23:00]  baby shoe  in the grill  something  nothing  everything's fine  so who knows  but anyway  yeah  I was drunk  on a bus  one time  and some woman's  chicken kept  clucking  I told her  to keep it  quiet  and she smothered  the chicken  and I couldn't  handle it  it's okay  because it was  just a chicken  yeah  oh that's right  it was a baby  yeah  no nuts  last episode of  MASH  you never saw it  no  it's a little  before my time  I mean I know  another topical  fucking viewing  it's fucking 
[04:23:30]  10 years  you have to  afraid of  that's true  well the point  is that if you  have a DUI  you can't get  into Canada  did you know that  right  this is like a  public service  thing for all  the listeners  you have to  it's a felony  in Canada  it's not here  so as a result  you have to get  if you want to  go to Canada  you have to get  all this special  paperwork  it costs like  1500 bucks  to get all  this bullshit  taken care of  if you're out of  DUI  yeah  and it's 8 years  so I had to  every single year  for 8 years  I had to get  this special  paperwork  that is  essentially  they'd staple 
[04:24:00]  it into my  passport  I had to get  like fingerprinted  and fucking  background checked  and all this  bullshit  but it's  felony paperwork  and that is  all that it  says  so I would  go to the  border  and I would  hand them  my passport  with fucking  serial rapist  paperwork  in my passport  and so they  would call me  into some room  and I'd get  interrogated by  the Canadian  Mountie authorities  for an hour  how are they  when they  how are they  to you  what's this  all about  how are they 
[04:24:30]  when they  realize what  it was  you're drunk  do you go  to AAA  sorry what  were you saying  Jim  how had they  treat you  once they  realized it  was just  that  still like  a piece  of shit  because it's  a felony  there  like  and to  this day  I now  have  permanent  rehabilitation  which is  what they  call it  which is  after the  eight years  you have  to apply  to prove  that I'm  no longer  a threat  to their  fucking  way of  life  they really  don't like  that  it probably 
[04:25:00]  has to do  with the  fucking  government  paid  health care  like  it's such  a drain  on the  system  that they  don't want  people  driving  drunk  and fucking  people up  no I  really think  that it's  because we  ratcheted up  border shit  on our side  that this is  their way  to get back  sorry that  fucking  people crash  planes into our  buildings  you canuck  motherfuckers  sorry we  ratcheted up  the fucking  security  I really feel  like that's  what it is  these border  guys do not  have access  to George  Bush  so they're  going to  fuck with  me for a  couple hours  you know  what I mean  that's what  happens  every time 
[04:25:30]  I go to  the border  and even  still now  that I have  the permanent  paperwork  like just  the other  day I was  up in  Canada  and like  sure enough  I got  pulled in  at the  airport  spent an  hour  talking to  this fucking  lady  about my  DIY  continuing to  go up  there  to perform  back and  forth  there's a lot  of good  comedy up  there  I enjoy  Canada  they're offering  me Montreal  this year  but I'm not  doing the  nasty show  I'm not  doing it  why didn't  you do it  it shows  I don't have  money  it's not  worth it  I don't want 
[04:26:00]  to do that  many shows  in a week  it's fucking  too many  how many  it's like  six  it's like  15 or 16  shows in a week  it's a lot  that is a lot  of shows  are you guys  going again  this year  I hope so  that was a good  time  so much  fucking fun  god damn  was that a good  time  wow that's  fucked up  yeah dude  it's a big  pain in the  balls  when you did  get your  dewey when  you got  pulled over  what was  that circumstance  you know what  it couldn't have  been nicer  it couldn't have  been a more 
[04:26:30]  pleasant experience  of getting  arrested  the cop was  real cool to  me but he  was like  I realized  as it was  going on  I'm not  getting away  with this  jersey  it was jersey  you realize  I've gotten  away with this  a few times  but this ain't  gonna be  exactly  I noticed  it was  going  differently  because he  was unamused  you know what  I mean  the other guys  were like  you're a comedian  that's neat  tell me a joke  or whatever  you know what I mean  what was this guy  saying  this guy was  just all business  you know  and it was like  okay I don't think  I'm getting away  with this  and then he  cuffed me  and I was like  I'm definitely  not getting away 
[04:27:00]  with this  put this back  in your  but it was great  I mean I thanked  him  laughter  apparently according  to the paperwork  it was like  I really was  looking for something  to get me to  stop drinking  so that worked  but I got to  do this is kind  of funny  I got pulled  over on the  Pennsylvania  Turnpike years  ago and I was  driving and sure  enough like this  cop he wants to  be all fucking  chatty or whatever  you know  and he's like  what are you doing  I was like I'm  going to a gig  I'm a comedian  and he goes  you're a comedian  tell me a joke  he's done that  thing and he goes  he's like writing  shit down  and he's like  he's like I bet 
[04:27:30]  you get laid a lot  doing this huh  and I was like  what  like this is weird  and he's like  come on  come on  you get laid a lot  right  and I was like  bad lieutenant  jerking off  on your window  it was so  uncomfortable  I was so  creeped out  and then he's  like he then  he's like well  I'm in a band  on the weekends  I get a lot of  pussy thrown my way  and so then he  just tells me  some story  about some fat  chick he banged  this past weekend  you know like  and you gotta  act amused  yeah and I gotta  be like eh  right on right  and so as  like he's like 
[04:28:00]  alright you know  get on your way  or whatever  and he like  fucking high fives me  you know like  yeah buddy  you know what I mean  just like this  weird fratty  that's fucking weird  so then I take off  and then he is  like kind of  we're pacing each other  now on the turnpike  and then at some point  he passes me  and when he passes me  he honks his horn  and gives me the  international pussy eating  pussy eating  between the middle  and the finger  he does that to me  and I'm like  what kind of a fucking  super trooper  so like I pulled  off at a rest stop  just to fucking  so he passed me  to get away 
[04:28:30]  from this dude  so then I think  that's the end of the story  the next day  Jeremy Schachter  calls me  he's a comic  he goes  dude you're not  gonna believe this  he's like  yesterday I was on  the Pennsylvania  turnpike  he's like  I get pulled over  by this cop  I swear to god  it's a true story  and the cop goes  what are you doing  I told him I'm a comic  and he goes  what the fuck man  you're the second comic  I pulled over today  he goes  do you know Jesse Joyce  he goes  yeah I know Jesse  and he goes  man that guy's a fucking  pussy hound right  that's what he said  so Jeremy had to  call me  and go like  what did you tell  that cop 
[04:29:00]  I'm like nothing  he just wanted to  talk to me about  snatch  trading fucking  fuck stories  doing the pussy lick  thing while we're  driving  he started it  that's great  fuck  that rules  that happened to me  too once  nah it didn't ship  it was like the least  professional cop  interaction I've ever  had  no shit  I like a good  unprofessional cop  when you're pulled  over though  yeah  you usually get off  the hook  wow that's fucking  brutal  it's not going to  get better than that  let's get out of here  jessejoyce.com for all  the tour dates

[04:37:30]  opium anthony  post show  post show  with sam roberts  yeah  call us up  866  wow  one  wow  866  969  1  969  phone lines  are wide open  as we wrap up  this thing  jesse joyce  is hanging out  what's up man  yo how you doing  man  you were great  today  you always come in  with great stories  thanks man  you ever  are you gonna write  i think i got about  six more appearances  of great stories  that's what i was  wondering  because it's like  you always  luckily you space 
[04:38:00]  out your appearances  so you can be like  yeah you remember  last time i was in  we were talking about  when i blacked out  tell me about that again  you can redo them  that way  yeah exactly  right  uh  no i  yeah  i mean like  i guess less zany  shit happens to me  now that i don't  drink anymore  yeah  i still think i fall  into good stories  you think you have  a book in you  i might  yeah  it just seems like  with all the  you got the zany  shit from drinking  but then like  you travel so much  yeah  and you go to so  many weird places 
[04:38:30]  like i feel like  when you came on  uh  it was one of the  first times  if not the first time  and started talking  about alaska  right  that was like  right off the bat  it's like  what does this  i have going on  yeah  so it's like  you've traveled  to so many weird  places  and you've interacted  with so many people  through writing  that it would seem like  it would seem like  there's a book in you  that's what i was thinking  yeah maybe  so i would think  that's a thing  that happens  when i don't have  any other options  you know what i mean  like i don't think  you really stop  you put the brakes  on life to write a book  you know what i mean 
[04:39:00]  like  we have all these  writing gigs for you  no  yeah  doing my book right now  yeah exactly  what are you writing about  this is what you would  be writing about  yeah exactly  do this person  it should be in the book  yeah  do you know henry phillips  you know who he is  no  he's a really funny dude  he's one of my best  friends in the world  he's a comic from la  and uh  he had this movie  called punching the clown  it was actually  it went to slam dance  and stuff  it's like  in the independent circuit  it like did really well  and uh  it's basically all like  kind of just like  slightly ratcheted  true stories about his life 
[04:39:30]  you know  and it's really dark  and funny  and uh  and then immediately  after the movie came out  this amazing thing  happened to him  that would have been  fucking perfect  for the movie  you know what I mean  it was just like  ah god damn it  do we redo the  anyway  and yeah  add a scene at the end  of it or something  I guess you gotta wait  until you feel like  your experiences are  really starting to dry up  yeah yeah exactly  right  like when you're  kind of winding down  in life  I think that's when  you put out the book  of stories  like because  you see like  wrestlers put out books  and they end up  having to put out  like three of them 
[04:40:00]  like Mick Foley  did like three books  or like Booker T  put out a book  where it's like  it stops as he  starts wrestling  and you go  what  what  I forgot that  you're a huge  wrestling dude  did you know  I roasted the  Iron Cheek  a couple of months  ago  I was about to ask  how did that go  you were  it was a disaster  but I really destroyed  but it was  it was almost not fair  because like I was  really kind of  you know  I mean I  did roast experience  yeah  you know as opposed to  did a lot of guys  there not have  they were relatively 
[04:40:30]  unprepared a lot of them  they thought they  could just go up  and like sort of  shit talk  that that's the same  thing you know  as roast writing  you know  as roast jokes  but it's not at all  like they're not  crafting jokes  they just be like  look at this  fucking asshole  over here  right  yeah  but yeah  you can  it's on the internet  you can just  on YouTube  the whole thing is  no just my set  yeah just  Iron Cheek Roast  and it'll pop up  but fucking  my favorite detail  Brutus the Barber Beefcake  was one of the people  so who's on  who's on the dais  of the Iron Cheek Roast 
[04:41:00]  the only like names  per se  were  Iron Cheek  Brutus the Barber Beefcake  Gilbert Godvrey  and then  and then  it was kind of  like a drop off  then there's this guy  who's like  famous in Canada  Spencer Rice  from the show  Kenny and Spenny  I saw that  what was he like  because he's on the show  Kenny vs Spenny  which is like  one of the biggest shows  in Canada  yeah yeah yeah  he's a fine guy  you know  but I mean  he was woefully unprepared  like he  he basically like  came up  and like  uncrumbled a napkin 
[04:41:30]  from his pocket  you know  and then just like  you're a fag  you know what I mean  that was like  the gist of his joke  you know  you really have to  write that down  yeah yeah yeah  so he kind of  bombed a bit  but he was a nice guy  and apparently  that show was super  popular in Canada  and did you do it  and did you do it  in front of comedy fans  or wrestling fans  kind of both  but mostly wrestling fans  because I would wonder  like if you're like  you're trying to  do roast jokes  are you only getting over  if you have like  little stupid  inside wrestling references  I don't know  I don't know a god damn  thing about wrestling  I'm thrilled not to 
[04:42:00]  and in fact  most of my jokes  were making fun  of the fact that  wrestling fans  were sad virgins  you know what I mean  like that kind of shit  but  oh but  but yeah  but it was a lot  of wrestling fans  and the way you know  is there was this  fucking idiot  who was on it  his name was  Jason Sensation  do you know who  that guy is  I remember him  yeah he did  he did stuff  a while back  yeah  he does impressions  of wrestlers  yes exactly  and so  it's like  if you're gonna  buy the premise  that everybody here  is celebrating  the Iron Sheik  yeah  they had him  come out  as like 
[04:42:30]  as Hulk Hogan  right  yeah  and it's like  he's the nemesis  of the guy  so like  this is not gonna  go well  you're just firing  everybody up  you know  yeah  and incidentally  he didn't look like  Hulk Hogan  it was basically  more like a dog  the bounty hunter  with jaundice  you know  like yellowish  like fucking  homeless-y  long-haired thing  then he came out  and like  he goes into  the character  so then everybody  else who's playing  along has to like  fuck you  like so there's just  this cacophony  of like 500 people  in this theater  just going like  fuck you  fag  you know what I mean  like then it's like 
[04:43:00]  now Jesse Joyce  you know  like I had to go up  after  oh and a fight  broke out  between him  and this shithead  who was like  a local radio guy  who bombed  wickedly  where did this  take place  at a theater  like a rock club  theater in Toronto  oh okay  so back in Canada  once again  some weird shit  happens to you  in Canada  yeah totally  so  and he's fighting  with Iron Sheik  or Jason Sensation  neither  this like radio  dick went up  who he was just  the worst  he was like the  zany morning zoo 
[04:43:30]  shithead  like the man cow  of Toronto  exactly  so he goes up  and just bombs  badly  and he tries  to do the thing  that Bill Burr  so masterfully did  which is own  the bombing  yeah  but he wasn't  qualified to own it  you know what I mean  like so he was just like  well we're gonna  fucking sit in this  you know  and it was just like  so he did like  more time than he should  have with people  like just ripping  their hair out  furiously  like fuck this guy  like they were so mad  and like that just  made him stay on longer 
[04:44:00]  and it was just a train wreck  like the reason it worked  for Bill Burr  is because he's a talented  fucking comedic  comedic genius  and you can't  sit in it  and then be like  well you guys are just  gonna boo harder  so I'm gonna stay  Bill Burr turned the crowd  around  but was still so spiteful  that he said  now that you're all  cheering me  still fuck all of you  yeah yeah yeah  and that was the genius of it  right yeah  it was yeah  it was masterful  but I mean that comes  with Bill Burr being  20 years into comedy  like you know what I mean  yes of course  this fucking idiot 
[04:44:30]  has no idea what he's doing  and thought he could  really sort of  recreate the same magic  it's always weird  when radio guys  think that they're comedians  yeah  because like  we sit in a room  with nobody  yeah  and just talk shit  right  and you can always  get callers to call up  and be like  you're the man  we don't have to go  in front of people  who are reacting immediately  they're like just  staring at us  saying there's nothing  around me  I'm here for you  to entertain me  at the end of a show  collectively people will go  that overall was funny  right  you know what I mean 
[04:45:00]  but if you're living  joke by joke  and you're also  you're driving  or you're  you're doing whatever  you're doing something else  while you're listening  to the radio  yeah yeah yeah  right  and then at the end of the day  you're like you know  I enjoyed that show  yeah you were funnier  than silence  right  exactly  that's what you were  as opposed to  at a comedy club  where it's like  I am paying to watch  you be funny  right  you know  and I'm going to give you  instantaneous feedback  people basically  listen to the radio  so they don't fall asleep  while driving  like  so they don't die  exactly  yeah  you were a much funnier 
[04:45:30]  alternative  to be running off the road  and flipping my Mercedes  but you're right  in a comedy club  it's like  you're living joke by joke  right  and you're looking  at people directly  in the eye  yeah  and it's a whole lot harder  to get somebody to laugh  looking at them  yeah  than to do it this way  like if you don't laugh  well good  we're just trying to have  a serious moment anyway  right  you know  on the radio  you could do anything  yeah  so anyways  so this guy  just bombed so badly  and then the rest of the show  it got so bad  that Brutus  had to get up  and throttle him physically 
[04:46:00]  like  that's how he got off stage  Brutus the Barber Beefcake  he grabbed him hard  by the neck  with his giant meaty paws  yeah  and like  threw him into his chair  and then everybody cheers  and there was this like  that was dark  because I was like  I might get hit  by Brutus the Barber Beefcake  for these jokes  you know what I mean  like he might punch me  and  like with wrestlers  they're not  I mean  they're entertainers  but it's like  okay I figured out  one basic thing works  the whole premise  of pro wrestling is  you figure out  one basic thing 
[04:46:30]  that makes the crowd  go nuts  and you just do it  over and over  and over  so like when  Brutus the Barber Beefcake  drags some guy off stage  and gets a big reaction  for it  in his head  he may be saying  I'm gonna do that  to every comic  that goes up on stage  exactly right  so that was concerning  yeah  and then  so like  that guy then  that douchey radio guy  rather than  like just fucking  leave  like he should have  right  you know  he chose to like  then sit in it  for the rest of the show  just cause he's like  which just ruins it 
[04:47:00]  for everyone  it totally did  and then  so then when this dude  comes up  he took a shot  the  John just dug  the bounty hunter  comes up  he took a shot  at that radio guy  and the radio guy  then comes up  and like yanks  his wig off  you know like  you know what I mean  which is a fucking  douche move  of course it is  as lame as this  impression was  it's like  don't fucking  like break the  fourth wall  with it  you know  like you just  can't  you know what I mean  it's just like  it's really an  unprofessional  shitty move  so then that guy  has no recourse  but to punch him 
[04:47:30]  in the face  and the two of them  start punching each other  like on the stage  for real  like for real  and they had to be  like whisked off stage  and that's literally  how I went up  and you're just sitting  there going like  I have to really  rethink this strategy  of I'll take any gig  that pays me  well no  it's like  I really wanted to  like I love doing  rose so much  like I really wanted  to nail it  and it's like I knew  I was going to  but it was just like  why are you putting  so many obstacles  in the way  of me fucking  getting this thing  back on track  you know  yeah how long was it  before you were 
[04:48:00]  you had that kind  of confidence  where you could walk  into this shit show  and know  I'm still going to be  able to nail this  well with roast  specifically  it's just the fact  that you know  I'm kind of in the  upper echelon  of like if  you've written  for every major  roast  you know what I mean  and like a lot  of the jokes  that I've written  are ones that get  quoted and stuff  so it's like  I know I'm good  at that  right  you know like  I might not be  good at a bunch  of other things  but that's a thing  and if I can just  do that again  yeah  which I did  like it works  for every roast  so I'm not worried  about like  the quality 
[04:48:30]  and the beauty  of roast  is that's the one  like sort of  last bastion  where people  just like  literally appreciate  pure joke writing  right  like a joke  it's a  it stands alone  it's a line  set up punchline  set up punchline  here's the joke  and if you did  that kind of  if you were that  surgical about it  in stand up  you would look  like a phony  you know what I mean  like when you do  in stand up  it'd be weird  if your jokes  were that  sort of sharp  and precise  right  but with roast  jokes specifically  that's what they're 
[04:49:00]  designed to be  right  it's like  just appreciation  of joke writing  in its purest form  so like  I'm not worried  about it  so like  that's all  I gotta do  is just like  present  these jokes  that are infinitely  better  than the  you have no competition  than the monkeys  fucking football  they were on  before me  you know what I mean  like I'm not worried  about that  right  but anyway  so then  it went fine  I think it's pretty funny  it's on YouTube  but at the end  of the whole thing  Brutus was clearly  like fucked up  on something  you know what I mean  huge surprise  yeah yeah  well did you know 
[04:49:30]  that story  how he got busted  in the fucking  he was working  at a toll booth  in the Boston  subway station  I think we did  a whole bit  on that  on ONA  did a whole bunch  of coke on him  or something  yeah  but the worst part  is like  he left a bag  of coke  after his shift  in the subway  like your bruised  beefcake  the fact that  you're caught  working in a subway  is bad enough  exactly  now you're busted  but what's even worse  is they shut down  they thought it was  an anthrax scare  they shut down  the whole subway system  no he just bruised  the barber beefcakes  drugs  right  yeah  yeah  it was just 
[04:50:00]  so brutally embarrassing  so anyway  so yeah  so whatever  so he has a problem  but then  like there's like  a little backstage  bar area  where like  you know  like the performers  could like  kind of go  and mingle  and you use that term  loosely  yeah  performers  yeah  yeah  exactly  so that's where  we convened beforehand  it's fucking  November  in Toronto  so everybody's got  jackets and bags  and bullshit  so like  we just kind of  throw them around  the back  after the show's over  I go back  to get my things  and there was like  a bartender 
[04:50:30]  whose job it is  is just like  chill there  and have beverages  for the comics  and I come up to him  and I'm like  hey  because I'd left  my coat behind the bar  and I was like  hey do you mind  if I just leave this  and he was like  no totally  whatever  so I go back  and he goes  dude I'm so sorry  and I was like  what  and he goes  Brutus  the barber beefcake  took your jacket  and I was like  what are you talking about  he goes  I tried  but you gotta understand  like I'm not gonna  he's basically  dude that's not  your jacket  and Brutus is like  what the fuck  you talking about  it's my jacket  and he's like  no no no  for real  it's the other guys  it's not your jacket 
[04:51:00]  he's like  this is my fucking jacket  and he was like  okay  you know  it's like  I'm not gonna get  into a fight  over this fucking guy's jacket  with Bruce the barber beefcake  yeah yeah  some stranger  so it's like  sorry guy  fuck you  so your jacket  got stolen by Bruce the barber beefcake  so I gotta chase  so I'm like  what  it was like  when did he leave  and he's like  I don't know  like four minutes ago  so I like  just book down the street  like I'm running down the street  and I catch up to him  like four blocks later  and I'm like  dude  and like  there's no recognition  and I was like  I was just on the show  I was just on the show 
[04:51:30]  I've had many fans  I'm sure  approaching me on the street  yeah  and then he goes  oh yeah yeah  the roast  like  it just happened  he was leaving the roast  you know  but it was like  oh yeah  that roast I did  and I was like  that's where you're coming from  so  so I go  you're wearing my jacket  and he goes  what are you doing  this is my jacket  and I was like  it's not  just put your hand in the pocket  there's keys to a Nissan in it  and a hotel  it's my  and he goes  like  he goes  he takes out  he goes  oh fuck  whose jacket is this  I'm like 
[04:52:00]  it's  it's mine  it's my jacket  that's why I brought this  to your attention  yeah  remember the beginning  of the conversation  five seconds ago  exactly  so  he's like  where's my jacket  and I'm like  it's probably back at the roast  he's like  oh yeah the roast  that didn't happen  but it's fun  so  he and I go back now  to the roast  back area  and we're looking around  for like 20 minutes  he's kind of furious  he can't find his jacket  or whatever  he fucking  then  the one with the giant shears in it  here it is 
[04:52:30]  it is  okay by the way  I don't know if you saw  what I walked in with  I was wearing like a top coat  like a black  Joseph A. Bank  fucking like  suit  top coat  kind of a thing  that's what I traditionally wear  it's kind of a Wyatt Earp  kind of a whatever  yeah  it works  that's the jacket  that I wear  we find his jacket  it's a fucking  poofy  red  snow jacket  red  like  fucking  candy apple  red  poofy jacket  and I'm like  in what world  could you possibly  like he was so convinced  in the world where 
[04:53:00]  oh yeah the roast  that's what world  I was totally expecting it to be  a similar top  because that happens a lot  you know  everywhere it was the same  kind of coat  it wasn't even sort of similar  not even  you couldn't mistake him  if you tried  John in West Virginia  prime time  Sam Roberts  the premier  broadcaster  of broadcasting  thank you John  hey uh  the one question  that's weighing  on all our minds  did the Iron Sheep  piss his pants  that's a great question  Jesse Joyce  did the Iron Sheep  piss his pants  no  to the best of my knowledge  he didn't
