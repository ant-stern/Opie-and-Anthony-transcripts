<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Sam Roberts hosting a "Worst of the Week Countdown" segment featuring comedian Kirk Fox, who discussed his new talk show, "The Test," involving lie detector, DNA, and drug tests.  Also present was Joe DeRosa.  The conversation included details about Kirk Fox's 2003 Honda Civic Hybrid, his past as a nationally ranked tennis pro who coached Hollywood directors, and his disastrous first pitch at a Padres-Giants game where the players hit on his girlfriend.  This was followed by discussions regarding Opie's frustrations with his child's school's allergy policies, the increasing prevalence of cashless transactions and technology, and the potential for widespread job displacement by robots.  Earlier in the week, the show had featured Chris Jericho and Kevin Pollak as guests, along with a Grand Theft Auto V gameplay segment.  Multiple advertisements punctuated these segments.

The show then transitioned to a listener’s story about seemingly stealing a hard drive at a self-checkout, which sparked a discussion on the frustrations of self-checkout systems and the broader implications of automation and job displacement.  The hosts engaged in darkly humorous speculation about potential social unrest and dystopian futures resulting from widespread robot-driven job losses, while also sharing contrasting opinions on the helpfulness of retail workers at different stores (Apple vs. Best Buy).  One Best Buy anecdote involved an employee offering a customer more than technical assistance.  The conversation then shifted to Dennis Falcone, the "Hard Drive of Hits," a recurring character and party DJ, with studio guest Kevin Pollak expressing his admiration.  The hosts engaged in playful banter about cross-promotion on Sirius XM, interspersed with numerous tangents and crude jokes, before returning to anecdotes about Falcone’s party experiences, including humorous run-ins with law enforcement.  More ad reads occurred throughout this segment.

Next, the show tackled a post-beach house fallout between Opie and his houseguests, Roland and E-Rock.  Roland heavily criticized Opie's barbecue skills (overcooked steak and improper sauce usage) and his early bedtime, while E-Rock's criticisms were more tempered, largely focusing on Roland's complaints. Opie vehemently retorted, calling them "food pigs," and recounted instances of Roland repeatedly falling asleep. The argument also touched on Roland's aggressive water balloon fight with Opie's son. This was followed by a segment featuring Jim Norton's hilariously inept gameplay of Grand Theft Auto V, resulting in numerous crashes and comical driving mishaps. Laszlo, who brought the game, and the hosts provided a running commentary filled with laughter.  Chris Jericho was mentioned as being in the studio earlier that day.

A significant portion of the show featured Chris Jericho as a guest, discussing his unexpected WrestleMania match against Fandango, Vince McMahon's management style, and the inspiration behind Fandango's gimmick.  He also compared the challenges of managing his band Fozzy to those of wrestling, drawing parallels between band dynamics and corporate structures. Jericho recounted a disturbing experience at a Black Sabbath concert with his nine-year-old son, featuring graphic and sexually suggestive imagery, prompting an early departure and a discussion on parenting and exposure to inappropriate content.  The segment included a call-in portion featuring Louis J. Gomez, Devin Ricci (Christina Ricci's brother), and Giannis Papas, whose disastrous Edinburgh Fringe Festival experience was the focus of a lengthy and often vulgar discussion.

The show concluded with a segment featuring Giannis Papas as a guest, detailing his disastrous Edinburgh Fringe Festival experience.  This included a terrible PR person who suggested fabricating reviews, extremely small audiences (as low as six people), and his ultimately leaving early.  The segment was punctuated by Devin's exaggerated laughter, the hosts’ frequent use of offensive language and insults, and a running joke about Giannis’s PR guy.  Discussions included other comedians like Michael Che and veered into various tangents, including morbid and sexually suggestive jokes.  The hosts offered their perspective and advice before the segment ended with advertisements.

Roland and E-Rock got in trouble.  It was a great week.  But why don't we start with this?  Comedian Kirk Fox was in studio.  He's got a new show called The Test.  Opi met him out in California when he was out there shooting a show for TBS.  And this talk show sounds terrific, because it's all like the seedy elements of talk shows combined into one. 
[00:03:00]  It's terrific.  Kirk Fox.  Joe DeRosa was also in studio.  So for that, here it is.  It's Kirk Fox and Joey D on the Worst of the Week Countdown.  Take a seat right there  Pull up the mic  What's up, Kirk?  It's all good 
[00:03:30]  Joe DeRosa doesn't get hugs anymore  I'll hug Kirk Fox all day long  All right, good to see you, buddy  Pull up the mic, the headphones  Me and Kirk Fox, we work together  Out there in Hollywood  No, if you were late, I hope he would tell you to go fuck yourself  No, that's what he does  Let me tell you what's going on here, Kirk  Let me just take it in  I'm not big in the city  I don't like this much cement  I prefer outdoors  Like just living in a tent somewhere 
[00:04:00]  Big buildings are bothering you?  Well, I'm getting used to them  But they're leading me into different rooms  And making me talk  I'm not ready  You're not ready  Don't do that  Don't do that on a radio tour  Let me set it up for you  Okay, hope he  Who should be  Are we on the air?  Yes  Who should be sitting in that seat?  CeeLo  We don't need him today  Nope  We sure don't  We pull off the CeeLo for the Kirk Fox  He might be sitting in this seat  Have you seen how small he is?  He's a tiny guy 
[00:04:30]  But he's wide  I might be on top of him  He's very heavy  But he's very short  I worked with CeeLo on How to Rock  How to Rock  What was that?  That was a Nickelodeon show  That I played the teacher  Oh  And he came in there  And did some singing  He did some of that singing  That he does well  I feel good  How long ago was that?  Right before we did  Who Gets the Last Hour?  You forgot that show  I don't even remember  It was last year  I think everyone else forgot  Last year, oh, okay  I think everyone else forgot that show  Remember the rumor was 
[00:05:00]  They were picking up a second season  Are you kidding?  They barely picked up the first season  I know  Didn't they do the exact same thing  With Howie Mandel or something?  Yeah, it's right after the TBS version  Yeah, yeah  Howie won  But I don't know as to inside  But when we had to film the audience thing  And present our pranks  Why didn't they have you guys there?  You guys did all the work  I would have come there  They wouldn't validate parking  Oh, man  So I just didn't want to start losing money  On the operation 
[00:05:30]  I hear you  And it was pretty far  It was out in the valley  It was fun, though  I like to stay within three miles of my place  A little agoraphobic?  Kirk Fox  I don't know if I want to go that deep  All right  But I prefer to stay in my room  Really?  Now I have a TV show  So suddenly I'm in New York  Are you filming in New York?  That's crazy  No, I'm out here doing  Just the press work?  A lot of press  It's called The Test  Yes, it is  What is it, man?  Lie detector, DNA, drug test  Somebody's coming on the show  They need an answer 
[00:06:00]  I'm going to give them that answer  But if you're the guy  That you know you're guilty of this shit  Why would you go on the show?  Oh, man  A lot of people come on there for safety  They feel that they're not going to get killed  If there's a million people watching  A lot of people think they can beat the test  And you're in a situation  Where your girlfriend says  I want you to take a lie detector test  If you say no  You're immediately guilty  So a lot of these guys say yes  And then hope within an hour or so  She'll forget  Or maybe the plane will go down  On the way to  Right, right 
[00:06:30]  Or somehow the test itself gets fucked up  Yeah, they try  All right, I like this  An EMP in the middle of the show  All electricity's lost  We have it all  But there's some serious conflict  And I'm in the middle  But this show's great  Because it's not just about the conflict  You know, a lot of the other shows  They just want the fights  And then they're done  We're getting the fights  And then I'm trying to stop the fights  Quick for safety  Right  Because I get scared  And then we try and resolve the situation  So this show takes elements of every show that you like 
[00:07:00]  Right  You know, courtroom  Little Maury  Little Jerry  Little, you know, we're helping as well  Nice  How do you resolve something like  This is not your baby or  You know  Well, you don't resolve that  The fact is it's your baby  Now what?  Oh, okay  Yeah, yeah, yeah  If you've created life  That life is there  So now, are you going to raise it?  Are you going to be a good father?  No  Are you going to take responsibility?  Oh, I thought you were talking to me  Listen, I have a lazy eye  I'm going to rarely talk to you  All right  Everything's going to Opie  Unless my eye drifts 
[00:07:30]  I'm watching the trailer for the test  Holy shit  It doesn't really seem like you're avoiding conflict  No, I see people  Wow, that one just kicked someone in the head  Someone's getting punched in the face  Wait, I want to hear the song  Okay  Start over  Start over  Let's see what's going on here  Coming up this year  Well, it's your show  You better know  Oh, smack  Summer is over  We go from dude to dude to dude  Is you a prostitute?

[00:09:00]  It runs the gamut  Of course  It runs the gamut  Everybody's got problems  He's sitting  Every clip is Kirk just sitting there with his legs crossed with the cards  Just like with this expression  Like, I don't know why these people are freaking out  We didn't see you bring up one face  Listen, was it something I said?  But the best part about this show is that  They had me join a gym to put on some muscle  Just in case  Just in case, okay  Are you serious? 
[00:09:30]  Of course  In case, you've got to throw  I didn't come into the game with a lot of muscle  Mostly sharp edges  I'm a little rusty  Right, right  They didn't want to lose money on people needing tetanus shots  But now I'm stronger and I can get out quicker  Right, you can move out of the way  You're so quiet in the clips  It looks like every family just has this tall white guy  As part of the family  Just kind of just there  Just a distant cousin  That's good casting  It is  You know, what do you want me to do? 
[00:10:00]  Just read the results and stay out of their way  Nice  There you go  And how much do I pay you for this?

I'm obsessed with your car  Ever since I heard about it  On the Jay Moore podcast  I still have it  I can't shake it  It's a 2003 Honda Civic Hybrid 
[00:13:00]  Wow  The great thing  Here's the best part of this  Because everyone wants me to get a new car  Because they think, you know, it's embarrassing  You should, yeah  Whenever I leave Paramount  I always ask these guys  I'm like, listen  Is there any other talk show host in the world  Driving a piece of shit like this?  And they said  Sean Penn drives an 87 Tercel  Oh, he does?  And he has since 87  No way  So now I'm looking to buy an 86 Tercel 
[00:13:30]  Something a little older  I'm just going to one-up him  I'm not going 87  I've got to go one better than Sean Penn  Yeah, that's  You got one of the first hybrid cars, basically  Listen, I think I got the one they drew  Right  I can't shake it  I'm just such a creature of habit  Like when I think  I've thought about getting a new car  And every time I start driving toward a car dealer  My car starts running better  Oh, really?  Like it knows?  Yeah, like a girlfriend  When you're about to dump her 
[00:14:00]  She starts doing things  Right, right  That's how I feel in my cars  It's like the day when you want to get your hair cut  Yeah  And you go, fuck, I don't need a haircut  I haven't even washed my car in a few years  Because I feel if I wash it  It'll start to unravel  Yeah  It's like my favorite shirt  How many miles?  Just leave it alone  Well, I think I've gone to the moon and back  Yeah  A lot of miles  You don't miss the amenities of a newer vehicle  No, because I'm not aware that they have any  Oh, they're amazing 
[00:14:30]  I've never changed your life  I've never been in one  Like GPS  What's going to change my life?  When you get a new car  I didn't have a car since I was in college  Because I lived here  And then I bought a car  And it's like, dude  As soon as you step in  There's like the Bluetooth thing  Where your phone is coming through your speakers  Yeah  I'd rather just have a dead tooth  I want my Bluetooth, my own  I'm telling you  It's like you get a new car  It's like jumping from a flip phone  To the iPhone 5  You're going to be like, what the fuck? 
[00:15:00]  I used to think about getting a new car to show off  Like, listen, I got my shit together  But now that I have my own TV show  I can drive anything I want  Yeah, there you go  Good for Kurt  That car finally came into style  Do you have the portable, I mean, take out navigation thing?

That's nice  Which was a terrible letdown  Oh, really?  What happened?  You know, I wanted the mound  You know, I used to pitch  So in my mind I was like  I'll throw out such a fastball  They'll just leave me in  They're going to sign you 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, right there  Like in my mind was  Let me just show them  What I got  What I have  Sure  And I did all the training  Worked out  Steroids for a week  I mean  I took everything  That I was supposed to do  And then they wouldn't even  Give me the mound  They gave me ten feet  In front of the mound  They gave me a real  These are the things I complain about  They gave me a lighter ball  So I threw it a little hard  Now I need Tommy John surgery  Because I already did that  For throwing out the first pitch 
[00:23:30]  Wait, is that true?  They give you a lighter ball?  I don't know if they give everybody  They have to give everyone  They wouldn't just give it to you  Here's the best part of this  Right  My girl's beautiful  And she was down on the field with me  We got there for batting practice  Every player on the Giants and Padres  I guess since they're  You know, in last place  And out of the playoffs  They were just hitting on her  Oh, man  Relentless  To the point where  They were giving her baseballs  Gloves  Bats  I mean  After I came 
[00:24:00]  After I threw my first pitch  It looked like  She was the trainer  It was just like  She was opening a sporting goods store  I was like  Baby, just give  Give that back  It's like  Give back  When a foul ball  Goes into the stands  You know  The fans just jump on it  It's the same way  When a beautiful girl  Lands on the field  The players just dive on it  Yeah, yeah, yeah  The best part was  That's upsetting  That's humiliating  That they put you in front of the mound  And give you a lighter ball  I know 
[00:24:30]  Like a Betty White  Or something  And I wanted the catcher  To be in gear  Yes  I was like  Put on some gear, man  I'm throwing heat  Let's do this  He's just like  And I threw it to him  And he didn't even catch it  Because he was looking at my girl  So now it looks like  I throw a wild pitch  And here was the best part  And I shit you not  We had really great seats  Just close enough  Where the players  Could still throw shit to her  Yes  And one of the guys  That was hitting on her hard  Came up to bat  Smiled at her 
[00:25:00]  Hit a home run  No  I'm not kidding  Wow  And  Yeah, that's for you, baby  And she was  She was quite excited about that  Of course  Then she noticed his picture  On the Jumbotron  Wow, he's got blue eyes  And  Then I finally said  Fine, you know  I'll get you the Jumbo dog  All right  You can get the big hot dog  It's like  That's all I can do  Don't these guys  Have any fucking respect?  None  No, they're in last place  There's no respect  I think the first baseman 
[00:25:30]  Actually went out on the field  And then realized  He'd given his glove to her  It's just like  Oh  Can I just use it?  I'll give it back after the game  I need it  It was awesome  And they only gave me a jersey  I just wanted a cap  Right  I mean, where am I going to wear a jersey?  Of course  Cap over jersey every time  So that was me throwing out the first pitch  I mean  Is it online somewhere?  I hope not  Yeah  Like they said  Do you want a picture of this?  I'm like, no  No  Why would  I want a picture of me standing 10 feet 
[00:26:00]  From the mound  Handing  With the wiffle ball, basically  Yeah  Handing the ball to the catcher  Handing it to him  And then the catcher  Gave the ball to my girl  It's like  Aren't you supposed to  At least hand it back  To you?  You gotta  You gotta think  They're over that whole thing  They don't want that  First pitch crap anymore  Of course not  It used to be a special thing  And now they do it  At every baseball game  Because I was from San Diego  And then they put me  In some green room  With the lady  Who was singing  The national anthem  So I didn't know  If I was supposed to sit down  Or stand up  The whole time  Right 
[00:26:30]  Because I don't  I don't know the rules  Listen, it was a rough day  That sounds like  Very stressful  Thank you for  Padres  Thank you for letting me  Throw out that first pitch  Give me the mound next time  But this is the stuff  You gotta do  Because you got  The big TV show  The test  Hey listen  I did what I was supposed to do  And it was  Forget pony show  It was 100 degrees out  And I was still wearing this suit  You must have been disappointed  Were you thinking about  Like how cool it would be  On the mound  Fucking whipping a ball in there  I just told you man  I planned  I'd been playing long ball  I'd been throwing  You know I used to pitch 
[00:27:00]  So I was like  This is my chance  I mean I tried out  For the Dodgers  When I was younger  After college  Did you really?  But I pulled a hand  Jesus Christ  Oh yeah  So this was gonna be  My comeback  And part of me  Even wanted to just  Make a move to first  And just like  Throw the ball  To an empty first base  And now I wish I did  Because everyone was like  Oh don't do that  It'll disrespect them  Really?  Every player disrespected me  Yeah  No shit  They're all trying to  Fuck you  Exactly  Now my girls  You know tweeting  With the shortstop  Of the San Francisco Giants 
[00:27:30]  You're in trouble  Yes indeed  Rolling right along  It's the worst of the week  Countdown with me  Sam Roberts  Still to come  On this here countdown  Where we give to you  The great moments  That happened this week  On the Opie and Anthony show  Kevin Pollack  In studio  Chris Jericho  In studio  Robots  And will they replace  Human beings  Plus Jim playing GTA 5  Before anybody else  But before we get to  Any of that  Let's talk about Opie 
[00:28:00]  And sending his kids  To school  Apparently in New York  You have to actually  Sell your firstborn  If you want to send  Your secondborn to school  That's just  I don't know what  The costing system is  But that's the way  They do it  Opie talked about  What he's going through  To send his  Three year old  To school  It's revolting  Here it is  This may be the most  Disgusting thing  We've ever played  The way  They are treating  Opie is unfair  You be the judge  On the countdown  Number six 
[00:28:30]  I was telling Anthony  I don't know man  I don't know  It is a weird world  How so?  Yeah  Well  One of the things  They discussed  I had to go and  Check out the school  And the classroom  Meet the teachers  And meet the head  Of the place  And they went  Over the rules  And all that shit  And you know  We learned that  It's a seedless  Nutless place  And then they were  Talking about  The allergy kids  Yeah  And I know  There's a lot of 
[00:29:00]  Parents out there  With allergy kids  We got one  In my family as well  In my extended family  So  But I don't understand  I just don't understand  Where these kids were  When we were growing up  I'm obsessed with this  Because the ladies  Like  And if you have  A kid  With the EpiPens  You need two EpiPens  And we got to sign  In the EpiPens  And they got to be  Behind the EpiPen  Glass box  I don't know  I think they're  Putting them in a  Glass box  So they can break  The glass  And get the EpiPen  Oh really  And I don't remember 
[00:29:30]  Growing up  A kid getting hit  With an EpiPen  I'd never heard  Of an EpiPen  When I was growing up  Yeah  Like nobody had  Nut allergies  Or EpiPens  A little known fact  I'm supposed to have  An EpiPen  You are  Yes  Because of the apples  I blew it off though  Good for you  Yeah  I only had  I only had one incident  And you know  I was in  The emergency room  With a huge  Fucking swollen  Ridiculous face  Is it apples for you?  I know I'm  Very allergic to apples  Trees, grass  Cats, dogs 
[00:30:00]  Jesus  Fuck  Dust  Trees, grass  And dust  Well when I went  To theologist  I said  Okay I'm allergic  To trees and grass  What kind  You know  Yeah  It's a good thing  There's not a lot  Of those on earth  But I'm like  You're allergic  To the planet  Yes  Right  The things  That produce oxygen  Yes  Yes  Also allergic  To people  Obviously  But I go  Alright  Trees and grass  Okay  What kind  Of trees  And grass  He goes  No  Trees  And grass  I thought 
[00:30:30]  He would give me  A couple  Like  Right  Specific kinds  The elm  Right  The elm tree  Can make you sneeze  I believe the birch  The birch tree  The birch  I think that is  Related to apples  Or something  I don't know  But anyway  So  I just want to know  Where the epi kids were  When we were growing up  I don't remember any kid  Dropping  During fucking school  Like  We just went  I would remember that  And then I asked  I asked Dan  Did those kids just die  And no they didn't  Because we  I don't remember any kids 
[00:31:00]  Dying in Washington Drive School  When I was just a little nugget  They drowned in the sump  They got hit by cars  Thin ice was a big one  Thin ice  That was a big one  When we were growing up  When we used to have winter  Yeah  That was many years ago  But  Winter  I never heard a kid eat a peanut  And then fucking collapse  In the cafeteria  We laughed at peanuts growing up  Need to be stabbed  Like he's fucking  On the beaches of Normandy  Getting a morphine shot  It just fucking  Nothing  Nothing  What happened  But what 
[00:31:30]  I don't know  What has changed  I don't know  Because I just don't remember it  I don't remember  A kid being sequestered  Yeah  To eat his  His little sad lunch  Because he's allergic to everything  They put him at a whole separate table  It seems like it's a real thing though  Like kids  I know it's a real thing  Literally close  Right  Yeah  I know it's a real thing  But what I'm saying is  We obviously have a couple generations represented here  Our generation  We just didn't have this growing up  There's got to be some kind of hormones  That are going into pregnant ladies or something 
[00:32:00]  Do you think there was some twist in the last couple decades?  Or did we have it that we mistook it for something else?  I think we might have mistook it  What did we think it was growing up?  Yeah  It had to be there  I told Ann  I think what it might have been was asthma  When we were growing up  There were a lot of  Don't give me your asthma  It's true  Nobody really has asthma anymore  When we were growing up  There were a lot of kids that had asthma  You know what?  Maybe it was the peanuts  And they had the inhalers  Yeah  Maybe it was peanuts  I don't  You don't see asthma as much  Because maybe now it's redirected to some kind of allergy thing 
[00:32:30]  That's the only thing I can figure out  Maybe inhalers will have peanut allergies  I don't know  But we didn't have kids flopping around at school  Because there was peanut dust and he touched a kid  That's why they don't want any seeds or peanuts in this school  Because it's not that the kid's going to eat a peanut butter and jelly sandwich  He's fully aware he's allergic to peanuts  Because the parents hammer it into his head from an early age  But they're talking about if my son has peanuts  And then touches a kid  That's allergic  That's all it could take 
[00:33:00]  That spreads like Ebola  Apparently  I don't know  It's crazy  I remember there was a lunch lady  And she was called Mrs. Hazma  Mrs. Hazma  And she was constantly yelling at everybody  And the kids would be like  Aha, you got a hazma attack  When you got yelled at by her  We called it a hazma attack  Because you cut the line  She'd be like  Don't cut the line  It's like  Aha, you got a hazma attack  That's pretty funny  Mrs. Hazma  I don't know 
[00:33:30]  I mean, people got answers  But it's not about answers today  No  It's just  We don't care about answers, really  It's all about being confused  I just  I don't know where they went  Because even if it was something else  But it was called something else  Yeah  I don't remember peanuts ever being lethal  They are  I want to make perfectly clear here  That we know they're lethal  All I'm saying is  I don't know where this was  When we were growing up  It's chemical warfare at this point  It's like a poison dart  Yeah, yeah  Peanut dust is like fucking crazy 
[00:34:00]  Like sarin gas  Yeah  You spread it over schools  Can you imagine the children?  Oh, man  Peanut dust  It's all you need, really  Yeah, and then  Really fast  The first political correctness thing  Happened yesterday at the school  Uh-oh  It's your first day  Yeah  What happened?  You know what you have  Oh  Oh, Louis C.K.  Happy birthday to Louis C.K.  46 years old today  Is that a short clip?  Yeah, it's only a minute 46  I'm not allergies  Alright, let's go with this 
[00:34:30]  Oh, yeah  Really fast  Then we'll move on  After bad thoughts  Hopefully you do good things  Everybody has a competition in their brain  Of good thoughts and bad thoughts  Hopefully the good thoughts win  For me, I always have both  I have like the thing I believe  The good thing  That's the thing I believe  And then there's this thing  And I don't believe it  But it is there  It's always this thing  And then this thing  It's become a category in my brain  That I call  Of course 
[00:35:00]  But maybe  I'll give you an example  Okay, like of course  Of course  Children who have nut allergies  Need to be protected  Of course  We have to segregate their food from nuts  Have their medication available  At all times  And anybody who manufactures  Or serves food  Needs to be aware  Of deadly nut allergies  Of course 
[00:35:30]  But maybe  Maybe  If touching a nut kills you  You're supposed to die  Jesus  Jesus  Of course not  Of course not  Of course not  Of course  Jesus  I have a nephew who has that  I'd be devastated if something happened to him  But maybe  Maybe 
[00:36:00]  If we all just do this for one year  We're done with nut allergies forever  No  Of course not  Wow  The brilliance of Louis CK  Jesus  Happy birthday Lou  Louis's birthday  Well I don't think any type of child being sick  Is fodder for humor  That's just my take  I'm offended by that  And I don't think he should be able to do comedy anymore 
[00:36:30]  What a great  What a brilliant way to set it up too  Of course  And maybe  You can talk about anything  In that context right  Yeah  Yeah  Of course not  So  So it was parent night  You know  Introduction to the school  The teachers  The classroom  And all that  And then they were going through the schedule  And things that  You know  Could be expected  When your kid attends school there  And  They used to have something called  Leadership day  Leadership day  It's already begun  So  They used to have something called 
[00:37:00]  Leadership day  And basically  You know  It's your kid's turn  To kind of be a leader for the day  And it's just dumb stuff  Like if there's an announcement in the class  Your kid gets to do it  Or if they're  If they're going to the gym  And they have to line up  He leads the line  Just dumb shit right  Good way to make a nice little Hitler  Jesus  So  They said  Well you know  Policy has changed  And we no longer call it  Leadership day  Oh boy  And I looked around the room quickly  Because this is something  I've been very curious about 
[00:37:30]  Way before even having kids  Like  Where the fuck does this shit come from  And I truly believed  For a very long time  That it was  The parents just becoming  Idiots and assholes  Yeah  Like the majority  So I looked around  And I saw all the looks  And then the teacher goes  We still have it  But we just call it  Hosting day  Ew  So your kid gets to be  The host  For the day  The host  Well so you're not the boss  Right  How you doing everybody  Right  Feeling good tonight 
[00:38:00]  Right  Come on  And as the teachers  Were saying this  They were kind of  Almost rolling their eyes  Like look  We know this is ridiculous  And they hinted  That someone had a problem  With this  The kids play  Follow the host  Now  Right  Right  So  So they changed it  From leader to host  And then I quickly  Looked around the room again  I wanted to see  The reaction  Every single  I swear there wasn't one  Not one parent  That went  You know this is a very good  Thing for our children  They all were  Rolling their eyes  Sighing 
[00:38:30]  Looking at their  Their spouses  Like what  So who comes up  With this shit  It's the one  Fucking person  That complains  And then the school  In this case  Collapses and caters  To the one weak  Fucking parent  That can't talk  To their kid  If their kid  Has a problem  With being a leader  Or what that means  To them  Then it's your job  To sit them down  And work around that  Isn't teaching kids  To be leaders  A good thing  Yeah  Like aren't kids  Supposed to learn  Leadership qualities  No apparently not anymore  And it comes down to this  When your kids 
[00:39:00]  Leave the school  And go into the real world  Those aren't the rules  That you're going to follow  In society  Everyone knows that  Leadership qualities  Have always been  Like a good thing  Were you tempted to ask  Like can I ask  Without being  A disruptive parent  Like can I ask  What the purpose  Of that is  You'd be a problem  But you might  All the other parents  Might want to know too  You might just have  More balls on them  To ask  I probably would ask  You know  Like not in front of  Everyone on the first day  I don't want  First day  I don't want to come across  As that guy  The person  The person I'm going 
[00:39:30]  To come across as  Difficult  I like giving it  A little time  You'll be difficult  There was no reason  To ask  Because you could tell  The teachers  Were like  You know  We have this  It came from  The mysterious place  Upstairs  I'm sure  Sure  Like the teacher  Can't tell you  Where it came from  The parents  Can't tell you  But it's like  Oh yeah  Yeah well  Upstairs  Obviously it's a little thing  It's a subtle thing  But it's ridiculous  Yeah  And I now know  From just us  Talking about it  Over the years  That it's not 
[00:40:00]  The majority of parents  I really thought it was  For a long time  It's the very  Very small minority  Yeah  But for some reason  Their voice is louder  Than the majority  And I just don't  Understand that  I think a lot of times  It comes from  These fucking  Dumb  Administrators  It's not  No one even  Complained about it  But the administrators  Think like  Oh you know  I don't like  That leadership thing  Right  Let's call it  Hosting day  Hosting day  Oh god 
[00:40:30]  You're today's host  Jeez  That's like what  Snooki does  At bargains  Right  Yeah  Lieutenant Johnson  Will be hosting  The battle today  He'll be hosting  You into battle  What do you think  A two host soda  No that's different  Jimmy  But when my kid  Comes home  I'll tell him  I'll go  So how was  Being a leader today  You know  I'll try my workarounds  I don't know  I don't know  What else to do  I was a host dad  Oh god  No you weren't a host  The kids end up 
[00:41:00]  Being pumped out of schools  Being expected to be  Just waiting to be told  What to do  Yeah  Right  Like with no sort of  Get up and go-ness  I think  I think if society  Was changing drastically  Then fine  Do all this in school  But it's not  It's not  You're pushing these kids  Out into the real world  And they're not treated  Like equals  And next thing you know  They're jumping off  The top of a building  Somewhere  Because they can't handle it  What happened  Wouldn't it be nicer  If they explained  Why they did it  Like if the teacher goes  Look here's the thinking  Behind this  Because you know  A couple of these  Little bastards  Just you know 
[00:41:30]  As soon as they're in charge  They pick up rocks  And they hit the other kids  With it  Wouldn't that at least  Make you go  Alright I kind of get  Why they're too young  Right now  To understand leadership  And how to delegate  Responsibility  Right  They had to be careful  But they were vague  But it was very obvious  What it was  It was somebody  In years past  Within the last couple of years  Actually  Someone complained  And the school said  Oh we'll go okay  And catered to that  You know  That parent  Lib fuck  Parents  Sitting there  The kid comes home  I was the leader today  No we don't need that 
[00:42:00]  Right  Why would you be the leader  Over anybody else  Right  Or I wasn't the leader  Yeah or I wasn't the leader  I wasn't the leader  Oh well  Right  But you're right  They never tell the parent  Like well we're sorry  You feel that way  But we feel  They just never do  It's like you know  We could bring it back  To ourselves  And radio  And radio shows  That get kicked off the air  Because the very  Very tiny minority  Has a massive voice  And the people  That enjoy a certain radio show 
[00:42:30]  You know the majority  They get fucked in the end  Exactly  It's unbelievable  So  That was about it  Wow  And then just kind of  Looking around the room  Going  Oh god  I pray  Most of these people  Aren't in my home  Like just thinking  Which of these assholes  Are going to end up  On my couch  Yes  Yeah  You now have a relationship  In some way  Shape or form  With these people  People were like  You know  Looking for a little contact  A little talk  And I just  Everted my eyes 
[00:43:00]  The whole time  Shut them down  Yes  Because I'm like  Shut them right down  I'll have a wait and see  On this one  Stay the fuck  Out of my life  I know how to read people  And there are a few  And they're like  They were playing their parts  And I'm just like  The worst of the week countdown  On the Opie and Anthony channel  I'm Julia Cunningham  From Entertainment Weekly Radio  The channel all about  Your favorite movies  And TV shows  And this week

[00:48:30]  About whether robots  Would replace people  And whether or not  That was a good thing  I thought that the answer  To that was self-explanatory  Apparently I was wrong  It's robots  And a cashless society  On the worst of the week  Countdown  We really have gotten  To the point  Where we're pretty comfortable  With giving  With putting  Our personal information  On devices  That we really don't understand  I mean, everyone's got 
[00:49:00]  A basic understanding  Of their phones  And how it works  And networks  And Wi-Fi  And whatnot  But you don't really  Have an understanding  Of where that goes  You assume it's secure  Because we've been told  It's secure  But, you know  And everything you have  Is on your phone  Everything you fucking have  You used to not  Put in your address  Yes  On the internet  Ever  Ever  The first big hurdle  Amazon had  Was nobody wanted  To do internet shopping 
[00:49:30]  Because you'd have  To put your address in  And credit card information  It's almost scary  Now, like, all your routing numbers  And everything are just  On your phone  Everything's right there  You got your fucking  Like, fucking PayPal  Is right there  Yeah, just stay logged in  Because I don't want to  Yeah, yeah  Like, your fucking bank apps  You could access your bank accounts  And pay bills  And stuff  It's all right there  On your phone  And who's to say  Who's accessing it  At any moment  They're pretty good  I think we've kind of  Resigned ourselves to it  Like, fuck it  They can just backdoor it 
[00:50:00]  Anyway  Like, if it's not on my phone  They can get it  But the companies  Credit card companies  Are pretty good  With refunding  Stolen shit, too  I had a stop payment recently  Because I was  I bought some clothes in LA  And they had to order it  From New York  But they ordered something  From New York and Chicago  Together  So my credit card  Oh my  Saw that  And then, you know  They put a security stop  Was it theft?  No  Someone trying to thieve it  Or was it a  No, it was a legitimate order  I was ordering two pairs of pants  On a tire  Some dumb shit  Look at you  Shopping all over the country  Well, you know me 
[00:50:30]  That's why they call me  Zip Around Town Norton  That's my nickname  I've never heard that  Yeah, yeah  It's a new nickname  I've been trying to get  To catch on  But they know  They fucking immediately  Put a flag on it  Yeah, yeah  I like the  Pay with the phone thing, too  Yeah  Pop up and just  Bleep  I haven't done that  And pay for shit  Yeah, it's pretty  God damn cool  I guess Dunkin' Donuts  That's what they've been  Advertising now  Starbucks, though  Where you could like  Fucking, yeah  And you just  Like, takes it out  Of your account  You just fucking  Moneyless 
[00:51:00]  The moneyless  The cashless society  That you heard about  Many years ago  They're like  Well, you know  One of these days  There's not even  Could be cash  You're just gonna  You know  Be able to  And most people  Thought it would be  Like credit cards  You know  To swipe and shit  Like that  But no  It's like this  Weird fucking thing  You're just holding up  A device to the cash register  How does it work, then?  Does it work by app?  Do you have to put money  Into it or  I guess you could  Probably link it  To your bank account  Or link it  To a PayPal account 
[00:51:30]  Or a credit card  PayPal updated  Their app  Where they now  Have like  A list of stores  And you can  You can see  What stores are  In your area  Where you can  Buy stuff on your phone  Pay for it on your phone  And then just go  Pick it up  That's like what  The Apple store does  Just walk out  The fucking door with it  You just grab it  And go  Hey, I paid for this  Yeah, you could do that  At the Apple store  The Barclays Center  They have their own app  Where you enter  All of your information  You can order  Everything that you want  And then  They have a separate line  And you just pick up 
[00:52:00]  Everything  Like order what?  What could you order  From the Barclays Center?  You can order food  Beer, everything  It shows you all  All the  All the food  Concession stands  Located near your seats  You choose what you want  You pay for it  On your phone  And then  Give you a number  Or something  Like number 140  And then you just  Go right to the counter  And you just pick it up  It's so weird  Doing the Apple store thing  Where you pay for it  And then you just go  And pick it up  At the store  Because you don't  Pick it up at a desk 
[00:52:30]  You just take it  Off the shelf  Yeah  It's like I bought  A hard drive  And I just walked in  And I just  Took it off the shelf  And I was like  I guess I'd  Just leave with this now  What?  And then you just leave  No way  Yes  That's how it works  You don't have to show anybody?  No  I don't know how they know  Well Sam  Let's be honest  You're a white man  Allegedly  Like you pick it up  And you scan the barcode  Or whatever  With your phone  Oh okay  You scan the barcode  With your phone 
[00:53:00]  Oh so it deactivates it  But nobody has to see you  No no  But you walk you through  And you do it yourself  Yeah  Yeah but the fact that  You do have to scan it  Means it probably  Demagnetized it  Or it takes it  Out of their system  Yeah I mean  It takes it out of its system  But I mean  There's no demagnetizing on it  No no  No I mean  I'm trying to figure out  Not demagnetizing  It's just  But it's a simple  At the same time  Nobody was watching me  So I could have been like  The security knows  That the barcode's been scanned  That's what I'm saying  Yeah  Yeah I mean 
[00:53:30]  They would have confirmed  That I was not stealing it  But still  It looked and felt like  It's just very weird  I was stealing it  Yeah  Do you think  Like when you go to the  Like even CVS now  When you pay for your own  And I like it better  It's fucking you know  Boop  Boop  Drop  Go  The less you gotta deal  With people the better  Except when you get like  Somebody that should not be  Doing that in front of you  Right  I never do it at the supermarket  I always do it there  Always  Never  Because I always  I always feel like  Because I hate it  When people don't know  How to work it  So I don't ever  I know I know how to work it 
[00:54:00]  I don't ever want to be  In that position  See just get someone to help you  There's always someone there  They always have what they call  Retard prevention  One of the person  Just kind of waiting  But boy  Those old people  Who don't know how to work it  Yeah  Yeah they don't understand  The technology  What am I doing here  I don't understand  And they mucking up the works  Yeah  Just mucking up the works  Yeah it's pretty fucking amazing man  With the scanning  Yeah yeah  When you do it at the supermarket  Like you gotta 
[00:54:30]  They know the weight of things  And you gotta leave it in the bag  And I always  I always end up like  Okay this bag is packed  And they go  No  Put the  And I go  No  Now everybody behind me  Is looking at me  Like I'm a fucking idiot  And like  You are  Everyone in front of you right now  Is looking at you like that  Because you gotta put it on the scale thing  You gotta leave it on the scale  The whole time  The whole time  I like going to the cash register  You have to  The bags  Huh  Are  They have like scales underneath  Yeah  So it knows that you have put  The item in the bag  But you could put 
[00:55:00]  Skip bagging can't you  You always have to put it on the scale  I think there's a way around that  At the supermarket  I think you have to  Yeah  You have to at least put it on the counter  Like sometimes I'll bring my own bags  Yeah  I just put it on the counter  And then I bag it later  Stores will eventually  Like the Apple store  Have no  They might have an employee  To help with glitches  But eventually you'll just walk in  And it will just be like a pure  Like the future  It'll just be pristine  The merchandise  And you'll just get it  Boop  And walk out  There won't be any more  Lines  I hope so  It's great  I think it's great too 
[00:55:30]  I saw a show on the fact  That there  A lot of people are  Losing jobs to robots  Yeah  Robotic automation  Things like that  Parking attendants  Yes  They showed  And they showed this warehouse  That had these little  Flat little wheeled robots  And it would go underneath these racks  Lift up the rack  And take it to the people  Where they would choose  What they needed to pack  In these boxes  And then it would take the rack  Back away  And it replaces people 
[00:56:00]  Who would be like  Getting in the way  And these little things  Can go under everything  So  Even though that's where  We should go  What happens to all those jobs  Yeah  Well they go to the robot  So we just decrease  The population  But someone's got to  Build the robots  But wouldn't people  Eventually have to  Starve to death  Yeah  There's no jobs for them  It's a gradual change  It is a gradual change  It's not like  They're going to go  Oh we'll just get  Factory jobs instead  No there's none of those either 
[00:56:30]  Can't have that  But there's the robot  Building place  Yeah  Just build robots  And they do it better  Than people will though  Oh man  But then the robots  Will build the robots  Yeah there's going to be like  Ten geniuses  That build robots  That build robots  And those will be  The ten jobs  Right that's it  Everybody else is fucked  Yeah  What kind of jobs  Can people do  The robots  Because cars are  Something to  Going  Yeah they were showing  To the supermarket  Back to the supermarket  Yes  And telling the lady  No  Those are four apples 
[00:57:00]  I need to know  The price of them  And the lady will tell you  Yeah exactly  So you have some fucking  Potential  Some future robbing victim  Which is what she is  Or a robot will tell you  Those are pears  I don't want to talk to a robot  Robots  Like there's no  Those are pears  I  I hate when I have to  Interact with humans  At a store  I like interacting with people  Like when they go  Oh can I help you with something  Oh  Called douche and bag  That's an awful idea 
[00:57:30]  When I have to  When someone asks me  Like hey  Can I help you  Do you need help  With anything  Even if I need help  I always say no  Cause I  It's like  Look  This isn't  Fucking brain surgery  I could figure this out myself  I could go in here  Oh I  I'm looking for a certain item  I'll fucking look for it  I like going to the Apple store though  And being like  Hey  Genius  What's your favorite hard drive 
[00:58:00]  Oh  Oh first of all  How do you get to anybody  They're always busy  Exactly  I hate waiting for their shit  You gotta wait  They pass by  And you go  Oh could you help me  Oh no I'm doing this  I'm sure if you go to the Windows store  You'll be able to  There's plenty of people  Yeah plenty of people  Lots of free time  I don't need five people to help me  So you don't have to carry me  While he gets my stuff  The Windows  I fucking love  You're going to a popular place  Yeah  It's just brilliant  I got that hard drive yesterday  But I went on about a four terabyte  Or eight terabyte hard drive 
[00:58:30]  Eight terabytes  Yeah just for home  That's great  That's not it  Stop looking at it  That's two terabytes  I'm looking at it  I see you're fucking greedily eyeing up  My two terabyte drive  Hoping it's an eight terabyte  But it's  Terabyte  You walk right in  It's fucking just wonderful  Oh yeah I actually just did go up to the register  And pay for it though  So I'm really adding nothing here  Yeah but I'm right  You're talking about the old way of doing it  But at stores like the Apple store  And the Disney store  They've got people just walking around  With those phones  Oh yeah  Are you done?  I can take you right here 
[00:59:00]  I'm for less cash registers  But certainly more people  I like people with handheld cash registers  That's fun  I don't mind if they're there  It's a blast  Handheld cocks is fun  Handheld tits  I don't mind if they're there to ring you up and shit like that  Right  I don't like the interaction  I don't like  Like if I walk into a Best Buy or something  And I want to buy some TV or whatever the fuck  I don't need them to tell me what the TV has or does  It's written right the fuck there  I never understood that 
[00:59:30]  I'm trying to just get somebody to go  Look I want that  I'm buying it  Just get it for me  But you also have to know like where you are  If you go to Best Buy  And you have a question about something  They're not going to know  No they're morons  But you get the idiots that go there though  And they're like  Is this 3D?  And you know what they do?  Look at the fucking box  The guy that you're asking  Yeah  Looks at the exact same thing that you can read  That's just it  There's no reason to ask them anything at Best Buy  It's not like you're going to be an H  I will go to Best Buy though  And be like  Tell me the difference between these two TVs  I'll do that  I'll do that 
[01:00:00]  I'll do that  I'll do that  I'll do that  I like them to tell me  What's the difference  Between these two TVs  Well this one's older and more passable  This one began dressing in a certain  Oh jeez  Of course  I'm asked the questions guy though  I like it  I like people there  I like a good question  I have no fucking time for that  Which is better  Which is better  Right  You get a second opinion  Is always nice  No  Because who the fuck  Who are they to tell you anything?  They know more than I do  No they see the TVs every day  Yeah they're talking about them all day 
[01:00:30]  It's all they talk about is TV  TVs TVs  But you can go online  You can do all your research online  You can do all the research online  I don't wanna  Yeah me neither  Oh you read the reviews  They're all assholes  Who read reviews  Ew  What are you going to Yelp  You queer  I'm busy  Every now and then  You go to Best Buy  You find some guy  In the camera section  Who's like  Been working at Best Buy  For like nine years  Oh great  Fucking loves cameras  Yeah  And you can tell me the difference  Between these two  Really  And then he gives you  And then he pulls you in the back  And he gives you a good mouth 
[01:01:00]  What?  I know I just thought it was really funny  That you like tell the difference  He's like  Come here I'll tell you  Yeah come here I'll tell you  Yeah  He takes you in the back room  Fucking hits you over the head  While you're still groggy  Yeah  Fucking sodomizing you  He brutally rapes you  While he's holding your afro  And he's pushing your face  In that fucking mop water  Robot's not gonna do that  I love the idea  Of everything being robotic  And I like going to a cash register 
[01:01:30]  And saying  Hey  You rang that up wrong  And they're like  Oh so I did  Beep beep beep  But a robot wouldn't  A robot wouldn't  Yes the robots make mistakes  No a robot knows  All the fucking  The right prices  For that week  The sales  The this  It's all factored in  At a cash register  Going where's a person  To help me  The robot has done me wrong  Oh  And there'd be nobody  And I'd just be standing there  Unwilling to say  Okay  Because I'm not gonna pay  The extra five bucks  Well then you don't  You start over  What  You move to another one  And go beep beep beep beep  Say fuck that robot 
[01:02:00]  No I need somebody  To tell me  Oh god  You are a needy person  You gotta talk to a human being  No  You see how they're dummies  They go  You know  Welcome to Best Buy  How are you  And I go  I'm great  And you know what I always say  How are you doing  You  And they're always very happy  I'm not happy  You can't be this guy  Yeah  No one that works at Best Buy  Is happy  No  Well they're happy  I asked them that question  They know you don't mean it  No but there's at least  Fuck how they are  They're at least happy  That somebody is like  Do they ever look 
[01:02:30]  Did they ever look at their name tag  And point at it as an answer  How do you think I am  Shit face  Yeah look  Look where I work  I'm here on Saturday  Yeah  Or see  You say thank you  After they ring you  Thanks  I don't  And they like that  I yell gimme  And I snatch it  Gimme  I always slow down  At the exit  When I'm leaving  With the bag and stuff  So it like shows  That I didn't steal anything  I'm not running out of the place  You look suspicious  So I'm like stop  I might stop  And like check my pocket  And you know look in the bag  And then walk out 
[01:03:00]  Because it's like  Oh he wouldn't do that  If he was stealing  Iraq  Do you know how many stealing  Do you know how many stores  The security will just wave you through  If you have any kind of paper  In your hand  And you hold the bag out  Like here you want to check  They just go  No go ahead  Then the Spanish guys get stopped  The sensor's gone off  When I'm walking through  And I turn around  They're like  No you're good  Yeah yeah  Happens all the time  It's the white privilege  They talk about  Do you know what I want to do  When a sensor goes off  I just want to start screaming  Like when it's like  Meh meh  I just want to stand there  And go like  Ah  Help  Help  Just scream help 
[01:03:30]  Drop your bags  It's very very bad  To eliminate  Like all retail jobs  Great  They won't eliminate all of them  No  We were just talking about  Eliminating all of them  All of them  Maybe some  It's just a lot of them  Like 70% of them  That's not all of them  It's 70%  Alright well it's very bad  To eliminate 70% of retail jobs  People will do other things  There's no reason  Computer jobs  There's no fucking reason  Computer jobs  For certain people  At certain jobs  One of the worst places  And I don't know what chicks  Are fucking you know 
[01:04:00]  At the clothing stores and stuff  But as a guy in a clothing store  There's nothing some guy's gonna tell me  You have your own fucking personal taste  That's not true  When you walk in there  How is another guy gonna be like  Well  That's not true  These pants  It's like how do you know  What I fucking want  Or like  I had a fucking Asian gentleman  Helping me  When I was in Barney's  A fucking  In his 40s  He knew what tie worked  With what  Things I'm not good at  Upper end stuff  Sure  You're at a fucking suit store 
[01:04:30]  Something like that  Yes I understand  Bert always helps me  If you're just going to the Gap  Or something  You don't need someone  To help you  Bert helps me in J.Crew  Every time  Bert  You have a guy at J.Crew  He's always there  He's a black guy  He always looks good  Dressed to the nines  Black guy named fucking Bert  Bert  Wow  Every time he helps me  Yeah  No robot's gonna tell me  You know  What shoes should I get  Yeah  Why should  You get the shoes you like  No robot's gonna hit on Jess  While you're trying shoes on  Exactly  Exactly 
[01:05:00]  No they're gonna tell me  Like what shoes would be  Really good with these pants  And then you put them on  And they're like  I wouldn't have even thought of this  This looks fantastic  No robot's gonna help you  You just get what you want  You get the closet from Clueless  What do you say  Yeah you just enter in  What color pants you're wearing  And they'll tell you  What shoes you need  What do you say  No robot is gonna make  Fucking personal decisions for you  That you should be making  For yourself anyway  Right  No I'll give you advice  A guy who knows  This is a fashionable guy  Who can help me out  To the next level  What is that  You mean gay  Maybe he's probably gay 
[01:05:30]  I would assume he is  Yeah  But that said  He looks fantastic  Every time I see him  Sam  I think someone's got a crush  I do too  I would date Bert  Sam was there  Just to talk to Bert  He doesn't even need clothes  Hi Bert  Bert goes  What can I help you with today  Oh I'm fine  I'm tapping  How are you  What do you got coming in  Anything new  No Sam  You were here two days ago  He must be so happy  When you come in  With your bushy eyebrows  You think so  Yeah  I don't  I don't like  Dealing with people  So I'm  I'm happy about 
[01:06:00]  The robotic thing  You gotta be more social  And you gotta realize  That these have  Greater consequences  There's not gonna be  New jobs  For all the jobs  Being replaced by robots  That's why  There's no factory jobs  For anybody  And all the fast food workers  Want to get like  Livable wages  Someone's gotta grease  Someone's gotta grease the bearings  On those robots  Cause those jobs  Were meant for  Yeah you know  Who greased the bearings  On those robots  Chinese people  Oh  For a penny a day  They figured  There's this one robot  And it's very adaptable 
[01:06:30]  You could bring it into  Like a grocery store  Or anywhere  A factory line job  And it could be  Programmed to do  What  Like a worker would do  Just some menial  Laborer would do  In a matter of minutes  And then it'll work  And they said that  With its lifespan  And how much  It actually costs  That it works out  To  You're actually paying  Under $3 an hour  For an employee  See  Saving money  With that robot  Yeah of course 
[01:07:00]  You're saving money  But  Everybody wants  $15 an hour  In fast food  Because it's the only  Blue collar job left  Because they can't work  At a mall parking lot  Or in the Apple store  Or any place  Because robots  Are taking over  Where are people  Supposed to work  That's a fucking  I don't know  Not now  Alright but let's say  40 years from now  Or 60 years from now  The world needs  Stitch stickers too  You know  And what the fuck  How many holes  Do we need  Yeah that's true  What are people  Going to do  Every two  Every two  Self-service  Checkout registers  Is one cashier 
[01:07:30]  That does not have a job  Every two you mean  Or  Every two yeah  Because they're small  Yeah  Yeah  But every  I'd say every two  Self-service places  Is one person  That's not working  But it's also  Everyone growing up  Now coming up  They're all computer  Literists  So a lot of them  Will be in computer  Jobs  Like a lot of them  Will be tech savvy  And able to survive  In this next 50 years  Because they  Like you know  You talk to someone  With children  And they talk about  The shit their kids  Can do on an iPad 
[01:08:00]  Already  And it's like  Stuff that you know  I was fucking 38  When I learned it  Well I think  If you look back  Through history  Jobs were always  Being replaced  By other  Types of jobs  Now the robot  Though replaces  The actual worker  That's what I'm saying  That's the difference  Okay  So you got like  The livery stable guy  In the old west  And then all of a sudden  They come up with  The horseless carriage  Oh my goodness  So that puts them  Out of work  But it makes  A whole new industry  Of the automotive industry  And deliveries 
[01:08:30]  You're going to have  Cars that can drive  Themselves  So not only  Will all the workers  Be replaced  You won't even hire  A guy to deliver  The robots to the store  Can you imagine  When you get into a cab  And just tell it  Where you want to go  And just take it  I don't want that  To happen  It doesn't stink  It doesn't stink  It doesn't give you  Shit in the morning  You'd know exactly  When you were going to  Once everything's  Computerized car wise  That will happen  This is going to be  Like minority reports  Think of the efficiency  Of driving  Yeah  I have to leave here  Eleven minutes  I'll be there 
[01:09:00]  And you'll be there  In eleven minutes  You know exactly right  No traffic  Because there were  Assholes  Fucking stopping  Looking at dumb shit  Side of the road  Half the population  Will be killed off  Oh that would be  Unreal  All people do though  What about  You like  Twenty years ago  Yeah  You would be the one  Getting killed off  No  Yeah  I have gifts  I need to give  To humanity  You are obsolete  You are obsolete 
[01:09:30]  You make your millions  And then you're like  Yep  Kill the rest  I did it  Fuck them all  Yep  Well not necessarily  It doesn't have to work  Down financial  You know  Lines  As far as who's  You know  Who's working  And who's not  Those are all  It's not the CEOs  That are getting replaced  By robots  Don't you think  Humanity has to get  A little more efficient  No  I think we're pretty  Fucking ragged  At this point  Just making more people  More people  That need more jobs  And need more food  And need more everything  How much more efficient 
[01:10:00]  Are we than bears  Way more efficient  Well you know  Bears are not efficient  They don't even have houses  Did you see that bear  Taking that garbage can  Two nights in a row  But there's not  A fuck load of bears  Walking around  There's tons of bears  They're in the forest  Yeah but they're not all  Sitting there  At one fucking lake  Going like  Oh I can't afford  A salmon  Fisher con  I don't know  They're getting  That's a privileged bear  He's getting more salmon  Than me  He should give me  His salmon  No fuck that  If bears were efficient 
[01:10:30]  They would have  Figured out ways  To build structures  And jobs  And a society  Their basic anatomy  Doesn't allow  For them to build things  I don't know  I've seen a bear  Try to swing a hammer  Yeah  Yeah yeah  It's a thumb thing  That's a solid argument  It's a thumb thing  Solid argument  There's just  I kind of like  The idea  Of automation  And you're really  Separating the wheat  From the chaff  When it comes to  Humanity  When the only people  That'll be working 
[01:11:00]  Are you know  The upper echelon  Of people  You know what  Automation sucks  Sometimes  Like you  You call somebody  Or you call a company  On the phone  The last thing  You want to do  Is go through  Automation sucks  Every time  You know what  You just want to  Talk to somebody  You just want to  Talk to somebody  Years ago  That was the case  But these days  That  The automated phone thing  Works a lot better  Than it used to  I hate the automated  I hate it  I just want to  Talk to somebody  Just talk to somebody  You are  Just hit zero  Because you can't  Reason with a computer  Here's what happened  It's a choice  Hello 
[01:11:30]  Yeah that's  That's what you need  Now  Hello  Yeah  What's your problem  And you're  You think you're  Getting better answers  Than pushing one  Or two  Or three  Sure  I called Time Warner  Two weeks ago  Time Warner cable  What's your problem  And I ended up  Getting  Tell me your problem  Tell me your problem  What's your problem  Oh I need CBS back  CBS  The drugstore  No CBS  What's that 
[01:12:00]  It's a network  You're not currently carrying  Well no  We carry all the best  If we don't have it  Then it's not the best  Okay well I want it  So I'm gonna leave  Leave what  Leave the company  If you don't give me  A discount  Let me talk to my  Manager  Okay I'll hold  Hello  Yeah he gonna take  A hundred dollars  Off that true coat  That's not what  I'm talking about  Oh  You just  You just advocated  Yeah  For the elimination  Of the lower class 
[01:12:30]  Completely  Yes  Like you want  An only upper class  Society  Yes  Okay  Well then I mean  I guess  That's that  Everyone's just  Magically upper class  There is a way  That through automation  You can weed out  The people that  Aren't really  Essential anymore  Yeah  Because that's what  I believe  That's what the future  Holds  That the basis  Of the robots are good  Argument  Yeah  When you weed it down  To what it is at its core 
[01:13:00]  Is  Completely eliminating  What we do is we build camps  And we just put them there  And we get rid of the ones  Who are not efficient  Camp sounds fun  It's the same  We're a very efficient society  Very efficient  Yeah yeah  We don't do too bad  We'd be more efficient  If we could give people jobs  Oh the more robots we have  The less jobs will be needed  By the menial  You know the menial jobs  The robots will do the menial tasks  No they're not  A lot of the menial jobs 
[01:13:30]  Are getting weeded out  They're going to  Well you don't even need them anymore  Just get rid of these people already  They're human beings  They have potential to do great things  All you really need is like actors  To make TV shows  There you go  Even that no  Make good TV shows  Not in the future because  CGs  Why don't we just CGI  With all the CGI stuff  And all the stuff  Where you can just program what you want  Eventually you'll be able to program  A fucking movie  And it'll just happen  Yeah  Or something like  Yeah I mean  Because now they can't even  Like there's videos of 
[01:14:00]  Oh look at the shark  He jumped out and bit the helicopter  Oh it's fake  Yeah  Hey is that a real UFO video  No it's fake  Olivia Soprano got like  Three or four episodes  After she died  After she was dead  You know  Yeah they have a live version concert  To Tupac now  Yeah  He's getting better than I am  He performed over the weekend  Did he  Yeah  Really  And you probably want to live in a society  Where it's robots  Operating the holograms  Yeah it's more efficient that way  And imagine  Like you could take that image right 
[01:14:30]  Imagine  Say fast forward  15 years of technology  You could take that image  So you don't have to just show footage  That's already been shot  Uh huh  The computer is good enough  To manipulate the footage  Into whatever would be happening live  And make new footage  Because it understands  Where to put all the  Pixel footage  This is  Technology is going to be  The death of humanity  Well  Look  Throughout history  You've always seen  When things  Advance  There is a certain element  Of the population  That cannot 
[01:15:00]  Adapt  Keep up  I mean look at  You know  The old  Serfdoms  Of England  Yeah  You know  Those old people  That lived outside  The castle walls  Especially  They live by the ocean  You know  You don't see them around anymore  No  Right  But as this keeps going  You will get to a point  Where you are  The person getting weeded out  Oh please  It's impossible  You think so  I'm an artist  I'll always be needed

[01:20:00]  He's a giant  Opie and Anthony fan  That's right  And he came by the show  Just to say hi  Because he was in town  And all he wanted to do  Was to meet radio icon  Dennis Falcone  You know  Everybody's pal Denny  So Denny was  Happy  To oblige him  Kevin Pollack  Meets Dennis Falcone  On the countdown  Hey is there any way  To get Denny Falcone  In on this thing  Denny Falcone 
[01:20:30]  You're a fan right  We listen all the time  Yeah my better half here  Is the one to turn me on  To the fucking show  Nice  Thanks  Yeah  No she  Yeah  It's going to be pop culture  With you till the end of time  Oh man  This one over here  Yeah  So  Let's get Denny in  It's a fucking hard drive of hits  Are you kidding me  This guy is magical  What do you like about him  He's magical  He is  The same thing that you guys  Go nuts with  With everything  It's got it's place  And it's purpose  And yeah  You can simply  Double cross the promotion 
[01:21:00]  Over here  Oh it's a Saturday night  So what do we say  For Saturday night  Elton John's  Right as hit  Coming up  I can't wait till he comes in  And you realize  What a judgment error you made  Jimmy's not a fan  No  It's not even a bit  He's a fucking time capsule  Here he is  Oh there he is  There he is  Hard drive of hits  Permission to come on board sir  Oh there he goes  She's loving it  She's losing her mind  It's a hot mic though  Be careful  Hot mic  It's a hot mic  Dennis Falcone 
[01:21:30]  Gotta work stand up today  You know  Kevin Pollack  Probably just made your day  He's a fan  A fan from this show  He actually wrote me  And said that he was a fan  This isn't even for the radio  That's great  Can I ask Sal  If I can get a picture with him  Alright you gotta ask Sal  Because Sal gets  Sal gets very upset  When Dennis decides  To take pictures  With the celebrities  That come in  Go through the proper channels  Yes  Go through the proper channels  Well I think  Mr. Falcone  Is all about proper channels  If I've learned anything  By listening to you 
[01:22:00]  On this show  Is that there's a proper channel  And a rule for everything  You have to have rules  How would you cross-promote  The word rules right now  And on the other music channels  Available on Sirius  Well we do have many rules  On many of the other channels  Exactly what we play  Like we have  The Metal Channel  Which is promoting  The Metallica show  The concert  That you can only win  By going to SiriusXM.com  So I've just promoted that  So you gotta make sure  That you're  You know you're cross-promoting  I was working on the 60s channel  And I was playing  Some Steppenwolf  Which would be a forerunner 
[01:22:30]  To the musical genre  Of Metallica  Metal music right  Okay sure sure  I'm still lacking  The word rules  Rules  Yeah yeah yeah  Let me see  That was the bridge  The bridge  Rules  Let me see  One of my rules is  Always to go into the studio  Fully prepared  Fully prepared  Fully prepared  And yet  Contrary to  Oh good  Right now  Contrary to that rule  I just kind of stumbled in  Can I  Can I  There's a rule  That I guaranteed  You learned years ago  That me and Ann broke 
[01:23:00]  And that's why  We're so fucking successful  And that is the rule  Of leaving your problems  On the other side of the door  You tell them  Hey there you go  Exactly  Every PD would tell you  Any problems you got  You leave them behind  Nobody wants to hear them  No one wants to hear them  As soon as you fucking  Into that studio  You leave all that  Outside the studio  Right  You're right  You've made a career  You've made a career  Out of just problems  Yes  Just the problems  Not only fucking  Bringing them in  But creating them in here  Right  Leaving any goodwill  We might have  Outside 
[01:23:30]  So how would you  Cross promote  The problems show  My mantra is  Good times and great oldies  But here's one by  The Eberle brothers  It's problems  One of those great  50s hits  That you hear on the 50s  On Fox  That's it  That's great  He just crossed  Promoted  Problems  Problems  Little information  He's the Larry Klein  Of Sirius XM  Kevin now you're  A fan of  Denny Falcone  Hard driver hits  But not  So much of a fan  That you're going to be  Filming him today  Right  You know  Would you have a lot  To say about comedy 
[01:24:00]  I wasn't on the spot  At all there  You're a big fan  Of comedy  Of course  Of course  What do you know  About comedy  There's a documentary  Called Misery Loves Comedy  That would be something  You'd want to talk about  Sure why not  Well why not  Is not a correct answer  No  Why not  There's got to be  A better reason  You're kind of  Auditioning right now  For Kevin Pollack  I'll do some research  Before I go in  Research  You've got years  Of experience  What do you know  About comics  And comedy  Who's your favorite  Comedian  Rodney Dangerfield  Oh boy  Anyone from  This century  This century  Let me see  There's a lot 
[01:24:30]  Of good talent  Out there  Jim Norton  Happens to be  One of my  That would be  A correct answer  That's a good answer  That's a good one  And how would you  Cross promote  Jim right now  Jim Norton  Is also one of  Our music hosts  As well as being  Heard every weekday  Morning on the  Opie and Anthony  Show  All the way  With O&A  All the way  Is that made up  Just now  No  That's all the way  With O&A  That's an old mantra  You've got to use that  All the way  With O&A  Let me ask you this  Do you have a backup  Copy of the  Hard Drive of Hits  Oh sure  Three  Three  Are they in three  Different locations  Yes 
[01:25:00]  One is in  Pete Townsend's  House  I always  When I go out  To perform  I always  Three fucking  Celebrity pedophiles  Yanked out of thin air  All attached to music  We did learn yesterday  That he's a pedophile  I'm not a pedophile  Well according to Sal  Sorry I should have  Ended that part  You just can't  Throw that word around  No you really can  You're right  But Sal thinks you are  Well you can  You can  Technically  Until lawsuits arrive  And then you stop  Right 
[01:25:30]  Right  Right  The cease and desist  So I had  Richard Blade  Come to the house  And spin some wax  For a 30th party  Because it was  An 80's theme  Okay yeah  And I understand  You two travel  With a hard drive of hits  And people can  For sure  Pay you to come  To the party  And spin the wax  Have you had him  At the compound  I had him at the compound  What a great time  We had  How many hours  Was he there 
[01:26:00]  Until the cops came  Until the cops came  So that's every party  At the compound  That's how the party's at  Right  True  The cops came  And they said  Turn it up you nerd  How many breaks  And say in a five hour shift  Will you take  Oh it's continuous  There's no breaks  Oh I don't take a break  Oh no  There's a catheter  What's happening  We keep the music going  If you want me  To knock it down  Because you guys  Are having some dinner  You know I'll play  Some background music  Maybe some Sinatra  Some Dean Martin  Some Michael Bublé  Because that's the kind  Of parties at the compound 
[01:26:30]  They all decide  To have dinner  At the same point  A little dinner  Fucking yeah  Yeah  It was a little loud  It was a little loud  When Jim came in  Remember he  He was actually too loud  He panicked  I heard that  Yeah  That's true  Why do I picture  These parties like  Any pool  At the major hotels  In Vegas  Just people dancing  And jumping up in the air  Is that how I  But the basement  Was more like  Playboy After Dark  He was going on down there 
[01:27:00]  Bill Cosby walking in  And just  Talking to him  Saying  Where's the  Joe  Because  You got  This thing  On your face  Are you ever  Relieved when the  Cops show up  Sometimes  Like relieved  Like thank god  I can finally  Shut this party down  Yeah yeah  Yeah, there are times, I was talking to the cops out on the lawn, and that's when Denny  made an appearance with the hula hoops, and he comes out from the side of the house as  I'm talking to the police, and he goes, I forgot to bring out the hula hoops, and I  just looked at him, I looked at the cops, I threw my arms up, like, I don't know. 
[01:27:30]  It was like the same delivery, Pesci was kind of upset that there was blood on the floor.  Sorry about your floor, Henry.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You got the blow-up instruments?  Oh, yeah.  What do you got, the saxophone?  I got the guitars, the blow-up guitars.  Just take the loan records off the shovel, and you hear your play those air guitars.  Come on, get them up.  I just heard that Dean Martin would call the police on his own parties.  I did just hear that.  To stop.  To stop.  He'd had enough, so he would secretly go upstairs.  How fucking funny is that?  That's great.  Dean Martin, the famous Lush, who they say half the time was iced tea in his glass, but 
[01:28:00]  he would go upstairs and call the police, and they'd show up and he'd say, I'm sorry,  everybody, we've got to shut it all down.  Because he just didn't know how to get people out of his house.  Wait, what's the iced tea rumor?  Iced tea rumor?  Oh, no, in his glass.  Oh, in his glass.  I thought you meant iced tea, kind of iced tea.  No, that it wasn't booze.  Half the time it wasn't booze.  But he was a raging alcoholic.  Well, the rumor is maybe not so much.  Maybe it was an act at some point.  I mean, that's been around for a while.  That's not a new Hollywood story. 
[01:28:30]  That's not a new, that's not hot off.  I haven't heard that one.  Did you ever see Sinatra live?  No, I did.  I saw him a couple times.  I saw him at the Westchester Premiere Theater years ago, back in the late 70s.  Sinatra's doing like a whole nice, you know, slow songs, ballads and everything.  Dean Martin walks out with a rolling bar.  With a rolling bar to the front and starts pouring drinks for people.  What do you have, pal?  What do you have?  Oh, that's beautiful.  Yeah.  For the audience.  Yeah.  In case the listeners didn't know, the hard drive of hits are, what are you, in your early 70s now? 
[01:29:00]  Oh, no.  You mean my age or the music?  You.  No, I'm not 50s.  Double nickels, 55.  Double nickels.  Jimmy's disgusted.  You don't like the double nickels, Jimmy?  Double nickels.  No, not even if you literally have 10 cents, do I like that.  Double nickels, 55.  That's just a way to say it.  55.  55.  55.  Would you put...  But the music goes back, you know, to the 1940s all the way up to today.  Technically, music goes back a little further.  Even further than the 40s.  I mean, I don't bring acetates or anything, but I mean, I do have everything from Big Band. 
[01:29:30]  Okay.  Because you have to look at the age of people.  Like, just this past weekend, I did a 40th wedding anniversary.  So people were in their early 60s.  Right.  The latest record I played was 1983, It's Raining Men.  Of course you're going to play It's Raining Men.  Well, how else are you going to get everyone on the floor?  They were just going crazy.  They were just going wild, yeah.  Although I did play Blurred Lines.  Did you?  Oh, well, one of the topical new hits.  Yeah, that's a great one to play at a transgendered party.  Because we all fight the obvious while we dance. 
[01:30:00]  Did you just say the people in their early 60s were going nuts to the music?  Yeah, they were going crazy, yeah.  It turns out it was two heart attacks and a stroke.  You're going to play some of that Saturday Night Fever music, are you?  I said, sure.  Come on.  Oh, they liked that.  Oh, they liked the Saturday Night Fever.  Can I get out there and I do a little strut, you know, that Travolta was doing?  Walking down 86th Street in Brooklyn?  Sure.  Just staying alive?  You know what, you probably could have played, later than 81, a few of the songs from Dirty 
[01:30:30]  Dancing, maybe.  Oh, I did.  We did that.  You did that.  Oh, yeah.  We were out there doing the contours.  Way ahead of you.  I know.  Who am I talking to?  I should know.  Right in the middle of Shout, I usually bang right into the contours.  You do?  It drives them into a frenzy.  A frenzy.  It's just a violent word for you.  Bang them into the contours.  What is the other one?  What's the contours?  Do you love me?  Oh, okay.  1962 hit music.  Contours.  I just can't get enough.  Honestly and truly. 
[01:31:00]  But what about the big hit song from that?  I had the time of my...  Use it as a wrap-up song.  Oh, you do?  Yeah.  I hope everybody had themselves a good time today.  Once again, a nice round of applause for our guests of honor, Shirley and Jack, celebrating  40 years together, and we wish him another 40 years.  How about it?  Let's hear it for one more time.  The reason we came out to celebrate.  I'm sorry, but Shirley and Jack, you just picked the perfect couple's name.  They really did.  They worked for Shirley and Jack.  I bet you Jack doesn't want another 40 years.  Exactly.  Jack's had it.  I feel like they'll both be a hundred.  We both know they're going to be dead shortly. 
[01:31:30]  Shirley's got a fucking half of Raw left.  Fuck him.  He made him up.  Fuck Shirley.  Fuck Shirley right in her mouth.  I'd like to watch a horse kick her fucking fake teeth out of her throat.  Jesus.  Cunt.  I really don't work.  I love Shirley.  Shirley's a cunt.  Oh, poor Shirley, right?  Honest to God.  How much more, Denny, if you just talk the whole party and there's no actual music happening? 
[01:32:00]  Would that be great?  How much more if you just do segues?  Yes.  No.  That would be great.  Just not talking to the party?  No, I want...  Oh, no, that's the personality.  That personality is part of the price.  Anybody can just stand there and just play the music.  I'm not saying part of the price.  I'm saying all the price.  How much to just talk?  I don't want music.  I just want you to talk for five hours.  No, that would be a boring party.  We're just going to stand there and talk.  How much to read Mein Kampf over a laugh track?  That's a legitimate question, Denny. 
[01:32:30]  It really is.  Once somebody hired me, they just wanted me to play big band music for four hours.  That's it, huh?  And that was tough.  Shirley and Jack.  Yeah, that was tough.  Shirley and Jack.  Shirley and Jack.  Those two.  How did you pull that one off?  And this was back in the days of vinyl, too, so I needed a lot of records.  You needed some 78s.  Yes.  Well, you know, I had them on 33s, but it was tough.  Did you pull it off?  Oh, yeah, sure.  Sure, you had to.  You have to give the customer what they want.  Well, of course.  I don't think I've ever heard them referred to as 33s.  We know they're 33s, but there's always other LPs or albums. 
[01:33:00]  That may be the first time I've actually heard.  78s, you always hear by the number, but 33s.  I'm going to spend some 33s now.  I worked at a radio station.  It was back in a farming community, and every morning from 530 to 6, we had to play polka music  because there was a lot of Polish people in the community.  So one morning, I didn't know that the, I had the turntable in the wrong gear.  I had the polka record, which was an LP 33, in 45.  Uh-oh.  It didn't sound any different to me.  Wow.  This is one of those stories.  It's a crazy story.  At the jingle party. 
[01:33:30]  Hold on.  Sit down first.  Wait till you hear this.  You didn't have it on 45.  Oh!  Sick.  Yeah, if you were to write the sitcom version starring the hard drive of hits, that'd be the opening scene.  Right, right.  So are you ready for this?  Right.  Polka music at 45 RPM.  Yeah.  That's crazy.  Absolutely.  And then Dolph Sweet grabs his chest and falls down the steps.  He's going, like, Polish.  It's like that EDM music today. 
[01:34:00]  It was so high energy.  It was just frenetic.  I remember as a kid, it was always funny to put the 33 and a third on 45.  And, you know, you listen to the Beatles.  Bad up in a bit.  Bad up in a gig.  Bad up in a gig.  Bad up in a gig.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was always fun.  I wouldn't take my records to people's parties.  What?  Because I wouldn't, I would want to be the person to put the record on the Victrola.  On the close and play?  Yeah.  Because, you know, people would scratch it.  I would hate when people would have those record cases.  Remember the plastic one with the spindle?  Oh, yeah.  And they would take the sleeves off and just put the records on top of each other.  Oh, my God.  That's not good. 
[01:34:30]  That's not good.  That just scratches them.  Oh, but how are they?  I didn't realize the added bonus of having Denny here was the abject frustration of Jim.  Oh, Jim is not a fan.  This is the best part of it.  He's not a fan.  He's disgusted.  How was I never catching on to that?  Oh, he's at home.  Jimmy hates what we call Denny.  It's not that I don't like Denny.  I do like Denny.  Yeah?  That's why you went write two words with friends.  Yeah, well, I have a fucking...  I have a fucking Q, two I's.  I'm good.  I'm saying pong.  An H and I and a V. 
[01:35:00]  Denny, what was the first record you bought?  First record I bought?  We were just talking about this the other day.  Might have been the Chipmunk's Christmas album.  Of course it was.  Of course it was.  It had to be a novelty song.  Yeah.  You're a fan of the novelty song?  Oh, I love the novelty song.  No, the first record you bought, though.  Dickie Goodman?  You like those?  Yeah.  Hey, Mr. John!  It was the Chipmunk's Christmas album.  Oh, my God.  And the Beatles' first album, too.  Meet the Beatles.  Yeah?  Yeah, sure.  Right from the Christmas Chipmunks to the Beatles.  Yeah. 
[01:35:30]  That's kind of a jump.  That's a very fast transition.  It's a big jump.  I'd just play them over and over.  What did you use to put on if, you know, you were kind of getting down on the ladies?  Before Barry White, what was your go-to?  What was your go-to?  Yeah, what would you put on to cover the screams?  The sound of the hammer claw hitting her.  Temptations, 1965, My Girl.  Sure.  My Girl?  Oh, yeah.  Tall, tan, and talented, baby.  The Temptations.  Nice.  How about the Four Tops?  Four Tops.  Sure.  Four Tops spinning.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's who, uh...  Four Tops spinning.  That's who you hire on a Friday.  More up-tempo stuff.  More up-tempo music.  Did I tell you guys when I... 
[01:36:00]  Dominant game, man.  No, the Four Tops was spinning.  Sloppy bottom.  Did I ever tell you guys that story when I did Casino and Rickles?  I was stuck there for 20 weeks shooting that fucking movie, even though I'm only in it  nine weeks, nine minutes.  The way, of course, it says he shoots is that you're just stuck there because he might change  his mind any given day, so they make you stay.  So I said to my stand-up agent, book me on the fucking strip opening up for somebody.  You know, I'm stuck here, so get me a gig.  So he gets me a gig opening up for the Four Tops.  And I come into work on the movie, and Rickles says, oh, I see you in the marquee there. 
[01:36:30]  You're opening up for the Four Tops.  That's great.  I'm with Frank all summer.  Let me know if you want tickets.  I'm just trying to make a buck while I'm stuck there.  He fucking hammered me right in the face.  Are we done with Danny?  Danny, I just...  Gentlemen, thank you so much.  Thank you, sir.  It's an honor.  You better need to take a photo.  We'll ask Sal.  But, uh, yeah.  Wait, we gotta...  The girl here needs a photo.  We're about to move into fall.  What should we be doing as a radio show?  What should we be doing when we get to fall?  What is that? 
[01:37:00]  Well, of course, you've got the fall festivals.  The fall festivals.  You've got the weekend.  You've got...  Not really a lot of fall songs.  Not really a lot of fall songs.  No fall themes?  Autumn leaves?  Autumn leaves a little too.  Well, Roger Williams at the keyboard.  Very nice instrumental, though.  That's a beautiful instrumental.  How soon before we start pushing to Halloween?  Halloween, basically, October.  Has begun.  We're seven weeks out.  Yeah, October because...  We're less than seven weeks out.  October, Jocktober.  You also do a safe Halloween.  When does Jocktober?  I know.  What do you mean a safe Halloween?  A safe Halloween with the kids? 
[01:37:30]  What do you mean a safe Halloween?  Safe Halloween.  We used to do that all the time.  Good times and great oldies.  We'll be down at the mall for you this weekend as we bring the kids down.  You bring the kids down to walk through the mall.  No.  That ain't happening.  Yeah.  No, you don't.  Seven percent less razor blades this year.  And I used to wear the costume.  I was the mascot for the radio station.  I used to wear the duck.  No, no.  I used to wear the duck costume.  What does that mean?  It was a mascot suit.  Sure.  Because every radio station should have a mascot.  We had a duck because I worked on Long Island.  You go anywhere in the world, you pick up a menu, and you see, gee, Long Island duck. 
[01:38:00]  So I wore the duck costume.  That's a moment of pride for you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I would walk around the mall taking pictures with kids.  Were you allowed to speak?  Kids love that stuff.  No.  No, no.  No.  No speaking.  Not inside that costume.  No speaking.  The worst is yet to come.  More of the Opie and Anthony worst of the week countdown.  Next.

Getting towards the top of the Worst of the Week Countdown.  I am Sam Roberts.  We're not quite at the top yet.  Still to come, Chris Jericho is in studio. 
[01:43:00]  We played Grand Theft Auto V for the first time.  But Roland and E-Rock got in trouble this week.  That's what I want to play for you right now.  Roland and E-Rock were Opie's house guests at the Beach House last weekend.  And they came back with some sort of not quite pleasant reviews of the experience.  Of course, this was when Opie was out of town, which Opie didn't take kindly to.  It's Roland and E-Rock getting a good solid bashing on the Worst of the Week Countdown.  Number three. 
[01:43:30]  Oh, no.  I didn't infuse it with blue cheese and put whipped cream on top and a little balsamic glaze.  And then deep-fry it.  Yeah, that was pretty much the...  Fucking food pigs.  Wow.  I think Roland's big gripes for him.  How are you going to get my fat intake? 
[01:44:00]  He put barbecue sauce on a barbecue.  He didn't like that you flipped it more than once.  You mean Roland, who falls asleep literally as you're talking to him ten times a day?  He's going to fucking make fun of my fucking steak?  Holy shit.  You food slobs.  Go fucking eat somewhere else. 
[01:44:30]  Wow.  Then he said it was overdone.  He said it was...  Yeah, I did overcook the steak.  That's for sure.  Overcooked.  I only learned how to use a barbecue this summer, so give me a fucking break.  Good morning, everybody.  Hey.  Look, I'll take anyone on, but don't fucking do it behind my back, you pussies.  You food pigs.  Holy shit.  You couldn't wait a day. 
[01:45:00]  And then what?  Then they had a problem because I went to bed at 11?  First of all, when you have a beach house, if you make it to 10 o'clock, that's amazing.  And fucking Roland was falling asleep on the couch, falling asleep at the fire, falling asleep as he's eating the steak, falling asleep as he's falling asleep.  Okay, he takes naps, I guess, right?  Is that it?  But these guys are going to make fun of me?  Are you kidding me?  They, uh, yeah.  Let me tell you something about being a parent. 
[01:45:30]  When your kids go down, it's called going down, that means you get yourself to fuck to bed.  Because you're on the fucking clock.  Oh, boy.  I went to bed at 11.  Yeah, I was up at 5.45.  Did you want to join me at 5.45 when the kids start waking up?  E-Rock, comment.  Oh, no, it was a one-sided conversation.  Oh.  He had his fun yesterday.  Oh, damn. 
[01:46:00]  The funny part, I got really nice text messages from both these guys.  Yeah.  And then I, you know, I got my guys.  They're like, oh, they're trashing your steak.  Uh-oh.  They're trashing your steak.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  I will say it was more Roland than E-Rock.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Roland was really, because you know what a foodie Roland is.  Roland had a big problem with you putting barbecue sauce on the steak and cooking it on the grill. 
[01:46:30]  Most of the food stuff was Roland.  Yeah, Roland.  Oh, what was your gripe?  I don't know.  I don't really had one.  Oh.  I don't know.  The store was going nowhere, so we had to bring up the steak thing, because Anthony goes,  wow, you had a riveting weekend.  I go, wow, what a weekend, you know?  So we were kind of just treading water, and I said, oh, yeah, guess what?  We had steak.  And then Roland went off.  E-Rock had kudos for your beers, for the beers that you had there.  Well.  What brand was that? 
[01:47:00]  Well, of course, E-Rock brings a beer and goes, this one tastes just like Fruity Pebbles.  And it was awesome.  Thank you.  Of course.  I'm not saying it was shitty, but the point is, of course.  It actually did taste a little like Fruity Pebbles, so I appreciated that.  It was very good.  And then a little Blue Point, a little blueberry beer.  That was mine, though.  But if you heard...  It was a Fruity Beer Weekend.  Nothing wrong with that.  And then Sunday comes along, and they just take off at like 10, 30 in the morning. 
[01:47:30]  I'm like, I bet you, because these fucking food slobs need to go eat a fucking buffet somewhere.  I think, yeah, fucking Roland was saying he was hungry.  Yes, but we didn't stop for food, one.  Two, Roland, again, head back, choking because he can't breathe while he's sleeping in the car.  And three, we were sitting in traffic before we even got near flushing on the LIE.  Just because of...  The Jets game, probably, right? 
[01:48:00]  And the U.S. Open had something going on.  Like, there was just so much...  The U.S. Open had something going on.  It's called the U.S. Open.  Fair enough.  My point is really simple.  It's like, you know, I know we all had a good time, and then I listened to the radio show.  I'm like, what the fuck?  Who is this horrible person that threw a horrible barbecue?  We all had a good time.  Like, this show's not even based on reality anymore. 
[01:48:30]  I think it was Roland and the steak.  That was the biggest part of it.  He was turning up all the times Roland fell asleep, and then falling into holes that he  was digging with your son on the beach.  Right, yeah.  Roland was very cool to my son.  Yeah.  They had a good time.  They had a great time.  He was throwing water balloons at him.  Yeah, because they're the same mental capacity.  Roland doesn't know fair play.  No, no, he doesn't.  If he could get one over on an infant or a child.  Poor little kid has that little pump, like a two-inch water balloon. 
[01:49:00]  Roland goes, no, I'm going to go and get the hose.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then arc it.  So it has more velocity as it tags the kid on the beach.  Well, he was throwing the water balloons right at my kid's feet, but the problem is he's  a foot and a half off the ground, so all the sand in there comes splashing up.  He's getting some splatters.  I didn't mind, actually.  I like that he's getting a little tougher.  Oh, God.  Oh, I wish Roland was here.  Oh, boy.  He's not going to like being on the receiving end. 
[01:49:30]  No, that's too bad.  But, you know, he had fun taking the shots yesterday.  Oh, boy.  I will tell you this.  When you got two foodies at your house and you turn on that barbecue, you're in panic mode.  Yeah, panic.  You're in panic mode.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I decided to soak the steaks.  Nice cuts of steak, by the way.  Probably too boring for these guys.  A little filet. 
[01:50:00]  Oh.  You know, less fat content.  Oh, my God.  And you put them in a bowl with some barbecue sauce because it was supposed to be a quick  barbecue.  Uh-huh.  Sweet Baby Jane's, whatever the fuck that barbecue sauce is for.  Well, apparently, uh, Roland says, uh, no, that is not what you do.  Oh, when I go over to Roland's house and he cooks.  Oh, that's right.  Oh.  He only takes, takes, takes.  I haven't seen him fucking cook for me yet.  Wow.  Although he does bring food in here, so I guess that's not fair. 
[01:50:30]  Uh.  What?  I think he, he's, he's doing something for you involving food.  Why?  To kind of help you along for, so this, uh, situation doesn't happen again.  I don't need help.  I try to eat healthy.  Oh, boy.  What's wrong with barbecue chicken and a little barbecue steak?  Nothing.  Yeah.  Well, according to Roland, there's a problem.  When I cut it to that steak and realized I, like, uh, I went, it wasn't medium rare, I'm  like, fuck. 
[01:51:00]  Oh, boy.  But I was the one that pointed it out to these guys.  They probably wouldn't even have known.  Well, I did say Roland put everything possible that you had on top of the steak.  What do you mean?  Just because it was there on the table.  So it was blue cheese, it was horseradish.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  It was fully covered.  A lot of condiments.  There was plenty of stuff to fucking jazz up the steak, but I wasn't going to infuse it  with anything.  He likes a good infused steak.  Of course he does.  He likes a good dry rub on it. 
[01:51:30]  Yes.  Some kind of dry rub.  Some kind of, uh, yeah, mixed of fucking food groups.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, Roland, pretty much.  He says he doesn't like barbecue sauce on the fucking steak, because then when you put  it on the grill, it burns.  Oh.  I had no idea until this weekend that there's a whole other process of cooking a steak that  even I wasn't aware of.  Oh, you can only flip it once.  You have to pre-cook it before you grill it, and...  And then you put it on the barbecue, you cook it, and then you flip it once. 
[01:52:00]  No.  What was the problem with my steak?  Oh.  Oh, Anthony was correct.  He said you don't put the barbecue sauce on it before you put it on the grill, because  it burns it, and you only flip it once.  You keep flipping, flipping, flipping.  What does it do to her if you keep flipping?  I didn't flip it.  I wasn't flipping, flipping, flipping.  He said you were flipping, flipping, flipping.  It wasn't even near the barbecue. 
[01:52:30]  It was me and E-Rock trying to have small talk, and we failed miserably.  Oh, no.  We at least tried.  I'm like, hey, grab a beer and meet me at the grill.  Oh.  Awkward.  We tried, though.  At least we tried.  Yeah, but everything else was delicious.  The steak was good.  It wasn't great.  This is what you have to deal with when you invite foodies over to your house.  Oh, trust me. 
[01:53:00]  I'm an asshole when it comes to food.  Oh.  I tell people it's tough with me, because I judge food very toughly.  Other than that, everything else was fantastic.  I do remember one of the times he was over at my house.  He had a problem with some of the skewers.  I think they were too salty.  What?  Yeah, yeah.  He's like, oh, he's a little salty.  What the fuck is wrong with you, Roland?  Hey, I mean, free food is great, but don't give me bad food. 
[01:53:30]  Free food is great, but don't give me bad free food.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Yeah, because, I mean, everything else is delicious.  Just the steak was a little bit tough.  My steak.  Mm-hmm.  I mean, other than that, though, everything else is good.  It didn't look like that scene out of Seinfeld where Frank Costanza over-seasoned during the Korean War, 
[01:54:00]  and everybody started joking.  Right.  I over-seasoned.  I just put a little pepper on the steaks and then threw it in some barbecue sauce,  because I didn't have anything else.  Sorry I didn't infuse your steak.  You like infused?  What could I have infused your steak with?  Well, if you threw a pepper on my steak, right?  I should have infused.  Holy fuck, yeah.  It looked like they showed, we were just watching the TV, they showed George Zimmerman and his wife side-by-side, 
[01:54:30]  and I swear it looked like the story was George Zimmerman gets a sex change operation.  Wow, you're right.  Yeah.  That's a great bit.  Before and after.  Yeah.  I should have infused your steak with some cocaine so you could stay awake for two hours.  Oh!  Were you napping a lot?  Well, at least some pepper on my steak.  I didn't taste any pepper.  Oh.  There was pepper on your steak.  Don't invite foodies over to your house.  Oh, boy.  There's way too much fucking pressure. 
[01:55:00]  Way too much fucking pressure.  What?  That was a guttural moan.  What?  Everything else is delicious, though.  Oh.  There wasn't anything else.  We threw together a little food.  It's the end of the season.  We don't have a lot of shit left in our house.  Actually, we got to get out of there this weekend.  Uh-oh.  Yeah, it was a great summer.  That sucks, huh?  What we have is like smashed potatoes. 
[01:55:30]  Smashed mashed.  Yeah?  Yeah, we would have had just potatoes.  Right.  We would have just fucking grilled up some potatoes.  There's a nice tomato and mozzarella salad.  Oh.  That's good.  Yeah.  Balsamic.  Yeah.  So, there wasn't anything else, really.  Yeah.  The side is, you know, just another side would have been excellent, but other than that,  it was perfect.  Another side would have been excellent.  We could have used maybe some grilled asparagus.  Jesus. 
[01:56:00]  To us, it's like, okay, you know, end of a long beach day, let's throw something together  for dinner.  I forget, for these guys, it's everything.  Oh.  It's what they've been waiting for all day.  Everything else was nonsense.  The beautiful beach, the waves, the fucking beers on the beach, the fire.  That's just distractions.  It was just distractions as they count down the time until they could bite into their  infused steak.  So we can feed.  Yes, feeding time.  Jesus.  Strap on the old feed bag. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, my God.  I'm done with you foodies.  I'm so done with you.  In the background, the beach, you go, ah, what can I get with my steak?  Did you enjoy the fire, the fire on the beach before you fell asleep?  Yeah.  It almost fell in it.  Yeah, he almost fell over on a beach chair into the fire.  This fucking animal will sleep anywhere.  He don't give a fuck.  One of Ope's neighbors came by.  Oh.  And sat down and was talking with everybody.  And just in the middle of a fishing story or something, you just hear, ah, ah, right. 
[01:57:00]  Roland's head is like falling off the chair.  And you're on the beach, so everyone hears this.  Holy shit, he fell asleep right there in the middle of someone's story.  And then he, yeah, he's choking as he sleeps.  It's the most bizarre thing to watch.  It's horrifying.  It's horrifying is right.  My body was hungry. 
[01:57:30]  All right, Roland.  You won't be getting any more invites.  Oh, man.  It's too much pressure.  Can't handle it.  I'll fucking show you the way to the fucking restaurants.  Ooh.  He doesn't mind.  Ooh.  Maybe next time Roland packs a cooler and he cooks for you.  Right.  Hey, there you go.  Yeah.  Do you know how to cook?  I do.  Or do you know how to just call up chefs?  I can do both. 
[01:58:00]  I got lovely text messages from both these guys.  Oh.  And then I'm like, what the fuck?  What is real?  Seriously, thank you for inviting us out.  We had a great time.  The fire was awesome.  All right.  There you go.  Eric is not talking about the steak there, obviously.  The fire was awesome.  They just didn't like what was on top of the fire, which was the steak.  Right.  And almost Roland.  And almost Roland.  And then Roland, thank you again for everything. 
[01:58:30]  A lot of fun.  Just when my allergies hit, because I was like, what the fuck?  Because I was trying to figure out what we could eat the next day.  And these guys took off immediately when it was a beautiful, I mean, it was a beautiful  day.  You missed a beautiful day.  Just when my allergies hit, I don't eat anything.  We didn't stop for food.  I came home to a bottle of Benadryl.  Oh, man.  What were you allergic to, Roland?  It had to be some cats or something.  That's the only thing I'm really allergic to is cats. 
[01:59:00]  I guess there was previously a cat in the room, he stated.  I think you're allergic to a semi-healthy steak.  Oh.  Oh.  Bet you some of that infusion keeps the allergies away.  I love how he has to have an infused steak.  Infused.  You just got to fancy it up, though.  Yeah.  Gussy that steak up.  Your food has to be fancied up.  Fancied up every time.  You are a fancy guy, huh?  Well, even when I was in high school, I go to a friend's house, I go, well, what's 
[01:59:30]  their side dishes?  What's their dessert?  No one's going to want you around if it's too much.  Hmm.  It has to be delicious.  How about you have a healthy weekend of, you know, basic food without any of that infusion?  He enjoys a good marinade.  Oh, does he like a good marinade? 
[02:00:00]  We'll put it in the marinade.  But just an over-marinaded, just perfectly marinated.  In between his ten naps a day, I didn't realize that I needed a good marinade.  Jesus, you fall asleep all the time.  It's like a shark.  Like a kitten.  Yeah.  They could just fucking...  They're gone.  If Roland stops, everything stops.  His breathing, his functioning. 
[02:00:30]  And what was the viral video thing?  Oh, that you kept trying to get Roland to tape a video on the beach.  On the beach.  And that he didn't want to do it.  He just kept flat out refusing to do it.  But we didn't even have any ideas.  I was just fucking around.  How about this Roland sleeping on the beach?  Right.  Well, we did pull out our cameras.  Oh, did you?  Oh, yeah, we did.  Got a few shots?  Not really.  Well, I guess we got a shot of him sleeping.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I wanted the 15-second Instagram video of him. 
[02:01:00]  That guttural snore of his.  I think Eric has some of his phone.  Oh, wow.  Well, that looks like a crime scene photo.  Let me see.  He's just passed out in the sand.  Yeah, post that.  That's what I was dealing with this weekend.  You can see right here Roland's feet as he's starting to roll towards the fire.  Oh, he's going toward the fire.  Right, right.  He's sliding down into the fire.  And then Eric was nice enough to get my son one of those giant styrofoam airplanes. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, cool.  It's bigger than him.  Yeah.  And then Roland proceeded to throw it in the ocean.  And the first wave just fucking destroyed it.  Oh, no.  Oh, so we kind of had to hide that from the little one because he was very excited by  the gift he got.  And then what?  He just forgets about it, that it would even be missed it?  I hope.  Let's dig another hole.  The wave just smashed it, huh?  Yeah.  Were you looking at it like, oh. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, it's so obvious.  It's not going to survive.  Are you kidding me?  Those things don't survive if you just throw them in a park somewhere.  Yeah, they can't take a good hit with a wave.  All right, Ro.  Ro, Ro.  I'm off to the subway.  Anything else you want to get off your chest?  No.  Was the bed okay?  Oh.  The shower?  Oh, the shower's phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Yeah. 
[02:02:30]  There's one of the showers in that house where the water shoots at you from every direction.  Oh, yeah.  Those are nice.  Not this one.  Did you use that one?  It hurts.  Yeah, my balls are like that.  Oh, you got to keep your balls away from that shit.  Yeah, no.  It hurts.  There's one shower in that house.  Like needles?  It fucking hurts.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What is that?  Huh?  I don't know.  All right, Ro.  We got to go.  All right.  All right.  No, not.  Fucking asshole.  He really, well, he likes his steak a certain way. 
[02:03:00]  All right.  Just bring it up in front of me.  Oh, I know.  He, I do remember that, though, with the skewers.  It was shrimp skewers.  Right.  And he was like.  He actually tells people?  Everything's very good.  It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's salty.  See, that's puzzling, because the guy you have that cooks for you at all your events  and stuff is very good.  Yeah.  All his food is amazing.  I wouldn't be able to take it.  If I had to fucking stand behind the grill and be, and be judged. 
[02:03:30]  So I just fucking get somebody.  That's it.  The worst of the week.  Countdown.  On the O.P. Anthony channel.

Here we go.  Worst of the Week Countdown time.  Chris Jericho was in studio this week as we count down the great moments on the Opie and Anthony Show,  but that we'll have to wait for just a few minutes,  because first, I want to play GTA V.  That's just something I want to play,  but what I want to play for you is Jim's experience. 
[02:08:00]  With GTA V.  Laszlo, our pal, brought GTA V in to the studio this week.  Before anybody got a chance to play it, we got our hands on it.  Jim is not exactly a video game aficionado, but he tried,  and I guess we've got to take our hat off to him for that.  It'll probably be easier for most of you,  but listen to Jim's attempts to play the game.  You can also buy property in Grand Theft Auto Online, 
[02:08:30]  so you can have an apartment or a house in the world of Grand Theft Auto V,  and your friends can come over.  You see them as characters walking around,  and you can watch TV shows together in the apartment.  Can you just go back there by yourself and take a nap?  Yes.  What a fun world.  I love Jimmy's, like, what Jimmy likes.  It's amazing to me.  Rides, naps.  He wants to play Grand Theft Auto V and take a nap.  And take a nap.  Yes.  Oh, man.  Oh, well, he's been very well-dressed there. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  You should give Jimmy a machine gun and let him...  Oh, boy.  Yes.  Oh, nice.  Let's have Jimmy shoot some grenades.  I don't know how to use the game.  I don't do well.  I'll show you.  All right.  A little grenade launcher.  I like that.  All right.  What do I do?  All right, Jim.  All right.  I'm turning the man around.  He's running.  How do I make him go down the street?  Remember the last time you just squatted?  He's going back and forth.  How does he shoot?  You squeeze this to aim.  Squeeze which to aim?  This?  Oh, I can feel it shaking.  How do I turn around?  Oh, fudge. 
[02:09:30]  I'm just walking with my gun pointed.  I get shot once.  Ow.  Careful.  I almost got hit by the truck.  See, this is what happens to me.  I just go in circles.  Now I'm shooting.  Oh, that guy.  Oh, Jimmy.  Jimmy got a kill.  Cocksucker.  Aim, aim.  Shoot him.  Yeah, Jimmy.  Jimmy's got two kills.  Okay, I'm putting some bullets in.  But I'm walking in circles like a tarred right into the bushes.  Oh, my God.  Now I'm just walking.  Where are you going?  You're in a parking lot.  Exactly.  This is what happened to me last time.  Oh, God. 
[02:10:00]  You're hit again.  How do I run, sir?  How do I run?  Oh, you're getting hit.  You're getting hit.  Hold on.  I'm getting shot.  Run.  You're getting shot bad.  You're shooting at nothing.  I know.  That's just a car.  I don't like that car.  I had bad service in that hotel.  Why don't you get in the car and drive?  I don't want to.  I want to go to the hotel and relax.  How do I walk into this hotel?  Jimmy's going to the hotel to relax.  I've had enough violence.  Oh, there's a hotel pool in there.  You could maybe...  Yeah, hey, I'm going in here.  Let me check my mail.  He's in the mail room of the hotel. 
[02:10:30]  Go out to the pool.  How do I go out to the pool?  There you go.  There you go.  Stop shooting me.  I'm walking.  Yeah, he's shooting.  I'm in the pool by myself.  This pool sucks.  How do I run?  Well, there's...  The green button.  Now you're being really...  You're being shot.  There's no water in the pool.  You've got three stars.  Yeah, I'm in the fucking...  It's sort of a...  It's not the nicest of area that he's in the middle of.  It's true.  It's sort of a bit decrepit.  Oh, the cops are all over you now.  You can shoot that guy to your right.  Oh, where?  You turn to the right.  Squeeze the left trigger.  Oh, fudge.  Squeeze the left trigger to aim. 
[02:11:00]  Shoot the police officer.  And then...  Oh, no.  Oh, you got one.  Yeah, you killed one of them.  What am I doing?  I'm right there.  Squeeze the left trigger.  I'm trying.  And then the right trigger.  So the left trigger aims.  Oh, man.  Are you in trouble now?  I know.  I'm getting shot.  Oh, there he goes.  He finally got one.  Oh, fuck him.  You got another guy there.  I'm going to run out to the street and try to get a ride.  Oh, you're being shot.  No, I'm not.  Oh, there's that guy.  Fuck him.  Goodbye.  Oh, Jimmy's actually getting smack talking. 
[02:11:30]  Let's turn around here.  Hold on.  Smack talking.  He's kidding.  Yeah, shut fucking mowing down and fuck these guys.  How do I get in the car?  How do I turn the AC on?  Get in the car.  Get in the car.  I don't know what I'm doing.  I'm shooting a sign.  Cock.  Wrong way, dummy.  Back up.  There he goes.  Did you notice that one cop was helping the other one and dragging him to safety?  Oh, wow.  All right.  Let's go back through the hotel.  Get in the car.  I'm getting shot a lot. 
[02:12:00]  I'm trying to get in the car.  How do I do that?  Here we go.  There you go.  All right.  Oh, I'm in the car.  Not driving.  I can't.  The doors are open.  Okay.  Go, go, go.  Squeeze the right trigger.  This is what happens to me.  I'm going in a circle.  He's going in a circle.  Jimmy.  Look at that.  He's brake-torquing.  He's smoking the tires.  What am I doing?  I want to go.  Jimmy, go.  I am.  I'm backing up.  Oh, shit.  He's driving into the pool.  Jimmy's driving into the pool.  How do I drive forward? 
[02:12:30]  He's going into the pool.  Jimmy fell in.  Oh, no.  His car fell into the pool.  Hurry up.  He just dropped the car into the pool.  Now you're fucked.  Get out of here, dummy.  You're so fucked.  No, I'm not.  I'm going away.  Oh, boy.  He drove.  There's one pool.  And he drove right into it.  And it's a small pool.  How do I get out of here?  Now the SWAT team is going to like to extract you.  How do I get out of the car?  Oh, you're fucked.  Oh, shit. 
[02:13:00]  All right.  All right.  I give up.  I give up.  Wow.  Oh, shit.  God damn it.  Aim, stupid.  You were in that car for two seconds.  I've actually never seen worse driving than Grand Theft Auto in my life.  It's so funny.  How do I get out of here?  I've had enough of this pool.  All right.  I'm getting shot.  Let me get out of here.  Blue button.  What's that mean?  Oh, my God.  Was that fucking funny?  Hold on.  There you go. 
[02:13:30]  Right there.  All right.  Run, Jimmy.  Run.  The SWAT team's out here.  I don't have any bullets.  Get in another car.  Okay.  I can't.  Get in that car.  All right.  Hold on.  Let me get in the car here.  Yeah, yeah.  Get in that car.  Hold on.  I'm trying.  Get away.  Get away.  Take the sheriff's car.  Yeah, I'm in.  Good.  Blue.  I'm in.  All right.  Go, go, go.  I'm trying.  There you go.  Go, go, go.  Which way is drive?  Drive, Jimmy.  Drive.  I can't drive.  Why aren't you going?  I don't know.  The wheels are spinning.  This guy parked it wrong.  They're pulling me out again.  I can't get fucking going. 
[02:14:00]  I don't know which one is the drive button.  Get back in there.  Get back in there.  Don't jump inside the car.  You're on top of the car now.  What happened?  Get down.  Get down.  Get down.  How do I get inside the car?  I'm getting shot.  Press Y.  There we go.  Now, how do I drive?  There you go.  Go like this.  Now, go back.  See?  It's not me.  Okay.  How do I get out of the car?  They parked it on the curb.  God damn that guy.  Oh, man.  God, is that funny.  Get that one.  Yeah, yeah.  Go, go, go.  There we go.  Go, Jimmy.  Go.  No, Laszlo got me in the car. 
[02:14:30]  He backed up.  There we go.  Now, we're just going to drive.  That one.  Okay.  There you go.  Hold on.  Fuck me.  I gave him a car.  He went 10 feet and ran it to a tree.  Hold on.  I'm speeding.  All right.  He's swerving down the road now.  How are you doing?  Good.  Nice.  He's flying.  This is like watching one of those drunk driving videos.  I hate fences.  You guys got to take the fences out of here.  How do I back up?  Oh, there we go.  Oh, okay.  There we go.  All right. 
[02:15:00]  No, no.  He's not back into the pole.  He's back away from the pole and then right back into the house.  Now he hit a house.  Fuck me.  You hit a house.  Oh, come on.  Move.  He's playing the Billy Joel game.  God damn it.  I'm not even.  Right into another house.  I know.  Jimmy, stay on the road.  I'm trying.  I can't.  Thank God.  He's giving your health here right now.  I'm trying to.  He's knocking down mailboxes.  I want to do people's backyards.  I backed up.  I backed up a little bit.  How do I turn it and go forward?  Forward?  There you go.  Just go forward.  All right.  There we go. 
[02:15:30]  There we go.  Slow and steady wins the race.  There you go.  All right.  He's back on the road.  Back on the road.  All right.  I'm going to go slow.  I don't want to get any more.  God damn it.  I'm trying.  The fucking mechanism's broken.  It's called an Xbox controller.  He can't steer.  I can't.  Jimmy, turn the other way.  I know.  What do you think I'm trying to do?  It's a fucking fence.  I'm trying to turn.  They put the road in the wrong spot.  God sucker.  There's no hood left.  I know. 
[02:16:00]  I can't do it.  I can't do it.  This is what happened last time.  I'm not doing this on purpose.  You didn't buy a PlayStation 3 last time.  Yes.  There you go.  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  He's back on the road.  Come on.  Go.  There we are.  No, not reverse.  Forward.  Forward.  Right trigger.  Right trigger.  See?  How do you guys go straight?  I lost myself.  I'm after you now.  Big time.  Wow.  A lot of shit.  The cops have blocked in and boxed in your truck.  God damn it.  I'm trying to back up. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, boy.  They're coming out.  Yeah.  They're coming to get you.  All right.  Let me just get out of here.  Let me get out of here.  They won one car in front and one behind, and they can box you in.  Go, Jimmy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You seem smarter.  Oh.  I fucking ran three of them over.  Go, fuck.  There we go.  You just ran over.  Oh, no.  I'm in a ditch.  I'm in a fucking ditch.  Oh, shit.  Oh, no.  You're in a ditch.  There we go.  Fuck this.  Now he's driving down a farm road to an orchard.  Of course, he found an orchard and hit the first tree. 
[02:17:00]  I want to.  God damn this.  I want to fucking shoot Croce.  He's hitting that fucking.  He's coming in for a landing.  All right.  Let's get back on the road.  Oh, there you go.  There we go.  Turn around.  All right.  Forward.  All right.  Turn around.  There you go.  There we go.  Slow and steady.  Now you're going.  There we go.  Let's drive responsibly.  Excuse me, guys.  Maybe we should put him in an airplane or something a little bit more.  Yeah.  Let's go on a plane.  This is very dangerous.  I don't even want to play the game.  I just want to watch Jim play the game.  Exactly.  We should do.  Well, after the game comes out on the 17th, we should do some gameplay videos. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah.  Of Jim Norton playing.  Yeah, just Jimmy.  Can we get me into a plane?  I don't know what I'm doing here.  I'm fucking.  But that's what happens.  I just drive in this shit.  You don't seem to be able to get the left turn, right turn thing.  Dude, I don't know how to make it go straight.  I just want to do an ice.  I was going to drive 55.  Right.  Do a double nickels, like Denny would say.  Obey the law.  Double nickels.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Is that fucking great?  That's hilarious.  When he drove in in the pool.  I'm not doing that on purpose, either.  I'm legitimately not.  He drove into the pool. 
[02:18:00]  Why did I know that was going to happen?  Because there was a pool there.  It had to happen.  Fucking awful.  Luke Costello had better luck with the pool.  That's great, Lash.  That's amazing.  We're a bunch of fun.  I can't wait.  The 17th, Tuesday.  Tuesday.  Yeah.  That is cool, man.  Where can I get one?  Well, I would pre-order now to avoid disappointment.  I hate disappointment.  You can go online for GameStop. 
[02:18:30]  You can stop at a GameStop.  You can go on Amazon and just order it now, and you'll get it as soon as it comes out.  How much are they expected to make first week out?  Oh, my God.  Oh, I have no.  What was the last one?  The last one was ridiculous.  It made at least a million dollars, I think.  Wow.  We've been so focused on actually getting this thing out the door and looking amazing.  As you can see, there's migrants down there.  Yeah.  There's Hispanic farm workers. 
[02:19:00]  I think there's going to be records being set here.  So right now, you're not doing anything wrong, right?  You're just going in to get a plane.  Now, let me ask you a question.  When you're doing this, you can just...  Forget it.  He gets so distracted by the garbage.  He's overly stimulated.  So you can have your own garage full of custom vehicles, and there's a place in the game  where you customize cars.  There's over a thousand different kinds of customization options.  You can own...  He's chasing a crop duster.  I want to see Jimmy fly at one of these planes.  How do you get...  Oh, my God. 
[02:19:30]  Is that a woman?  Get her out of there.  Amelia Earhart beat it.  All right.  Yeah.  How do you turn the plane around?  This guy's good with the controllers.  Good.  Run her over.  Oh, that's so great.  She's fucking getting dragged under a plane.  How embarrassing.  I'm getting her to make me a pie.  Let the men do the plane riding.  Oh, shit.  And now you're turning the camera angle around?  Fuck, man.  Yeah.  This guy knows everything.  He's trying to back the plane up. 
[02:20:00]  Trying to turn that plane around.  It's hard, though, right?  That's fucking hard.  Even he's having trouble with it.  What's the plane?  He's trying to be careful so he doesn't bust the crop.  Yeah, he'll bust the plane up.  Yeah, I know, but...  I have no doubt that if Jim got the hang of these controls, he would become addicted  to this game.  That's why...  Believe me, I know.  That's why you avoid it, right?  And I would do awful...  I would just do nothing that was fun, either.  I would stop in and buy a honey bun while all the cops were outside.  What are you doing?  You've seen this show.  Honey bun.  All right, here we go.  But you can have an entire hangar full of different airplanes. 
[02:20:30]  Nice.  You can have your own garage.  Do you have jets?  There's jets.  There's fighter jets.  Can you fly like a commercial airliner?  Oh.  There you go.  In the air.  The plane's in the air.  Get Jimmy up in the air.  Now let Jim...  How many seconds...  How do we get into the cockpit view?  I want to see the cockpit view so I feel like I'm in the plane.  There you go.  Great.  That's a little wobbly, that view.  You're looking right through the propeller.  Yeah, is that what the pilot would see? 
[02:21:00]  Yes.  Yeah, let's see what the pilot would see.  I want to be a pilot.  Let it rip, Jim.  Now what do I do?  Oh, boy.  Oh, shit.  Oh, we're already banking.  Oh, no.  Shit.  Keep this down.  Oh, shit.  He points the nose straight to the ground.  I didn't know.  Okay, there we go.  Oh, yeah.  He's looking at the stars.  Oh, no.  Go left?  Oh, Jesus.  He's doing a barrel roll.  Getting a seasick.  No, this is cool. 
[02:21:30]  I'm doing a good job.  Where's the city?  I want to...  Oh, my God.  You're completely upside down.  Jimmy, you're upside down.  He's doing an emelman.  Oh, Jimmy.  Jimmy, you're going...  Oh, damn it.  Oh, I crashed.  Can I ride the ship here?  16 seconds.  There's no riding the ship.  All right, let me get out.  Yeah, I think you're better.  What do I do?  That thing's going to blow off.  Is there another plane?  He's standing on top of the plane.  Yeah, let's move it.  The plane is on fire.  How do I run?  A tough guy.  What am I carrying?  A grenade?  Oh! 
[02:22:00]  He cooked a grenade in his hand.  It was just running, and it exploded while he was holding it.  What am I carrying?  A grenade in his hand?  He goes...  Blam!  How do I make him run?  We'll do that green button.  Oh, green is run.  I don't know these things.  Pull himself up with a grenade.  Okay, get up!  Get up, dummy, go.  There we go.  Oh, God.  Now, where's the plane?  I've got to steal a plane.  You are hilarious.  Where's the plane?  Straightforward.  All right, I'll just keep going.  Oh, the cops are...  I know.  Of course they're coming.  I've just crashed that aircraft.  But they'll be distracted back there, like they won't fight. 
[02:22:30]  Of course.  You're fine.  They won't look for the guy running down the street cooking grenades.  That was so funny.  What is this, a grenade?  Blam!  I'm holding a grenade.  Wait, where's the fucking plane?  I'm just running this whole game.  Is there a car?  Well, you're on a runway.  They tend to be long.  It's a vast open world of Grand Theft Auto V.  Yeah, fuck, man.  Oh, man.  Oh, I should mention, there's also a storyline in this game that you can do.  There's three different storylines.  Three different storylines. 
[02:23:00]  Three different characters.  Right.  They all come together.  Oh, is that a plane ride?  No.  I read you can kind of like choose your own adventure in some of these missions where...  Yeah, so there's heists where you set up these, like if you're going to go rob a jewelry  store or a bank or even just stop an armored car, you set up, you have a sort of a planning  board and you pick the guys that you want to come with you.  You pick if you want to go in loud or if you want to go in strategic.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, so there's a lot of...  You're Mr. Pink. 
[02:23:30]  A lot of different...  There's a plane, Jimmy.  I know.  I just don't know what to do.  Get it?  Yeah, we go.  Go press the Y button.  Yellow button.  All right.  Oh, here we go.  I have a feeling it's going to go barely into that hangar and explode.  How do I turn the plane around?  How do I turn the ship around?  Can you see you pull back and then to reverse?  This is not going to end.  Oh, look.  Oh, he's pulling out.  All right.  He's pulling out.  Reverse.  What makes us think that if he couldn't drive a car...  How do I make the fucking plane go back properly?  Well, there you go.  There you go.  Now turn left and let it rest. 
[02:24:00]  I'm trying.  I'm going forward.  You're going backwards, actually.  I'm panicking.  Okay.  Turn right.  I'm trying to turn.  Look, is it broken?  Oh, here he's going to just go straight into the hangar and explode.  It's actually this one.  Turn left.  Turn left on the plane.  Oh, turn left on the plane.  Now go, go, yeah, go.  Give it some gas.  Turn left.  Give it some gas.  There you go.  All right.  Full speed ahead.  No, turning right.  How do I turn right?  Turn right.  Oh, see, no one tells me.  Okay.  Turn right.  We told you and you're still going the wrong direction. 
[02:24:30]  No, no, no.  There we go.  That's perfect.  No, that's a very short runway.  That's a short runway.  You want to turn the other way.  You got to go.  Back.  Cock.  Look, it's broken.  He can't.  He can't.  This would be a viral video.  Jimmy playing video games.  I'm backing up.  All right.  How do you stop it?  Like, oh, this is left turn?  Well.  These two, it's left and right.  Okay.  Oh, that's tricky.  That is fucking.  There we go.  It's tricky.  The left and the right.  All right. 
[02:25:00]  Hold on.  Oh, boy.  Keep going.  All right.  All right.  He's on the runway.  Open it up.  How do you open it up?  Right trigger.  Right trigger.  Come on.  Okay.  All right.  Speeding down the runway.  Oh, no.  Pull back on the stick a little bit.  A little right.  Whoa.  He's taking off.  Hey.  We're airborne.  He's airborne.  Nice.  All right.  No, no, no.  Bro, you're breaking it.  What happened?  You were diving there.  Evidently flying into the sun now.  Boy, this is really hard, though, because you really lose perspective.  We've changed the time of day for you. 
[02:25:30]  How do you make it go up?  Oh, there you go.  Oh, he's flying toward the sun.  Wow.  That's right.  Icarus.  See, you can't.  God.  Turn around.  No.  No.  Straight down.  Oh.  He pulled out of a death dog.  That's right.  He was doing a full loop-de-loop.  Fuck, yeah.  He pulled out of the worst death dog.  Absolutely.  Pure luck.  That was the fucking...  The bottom of that plane was scraping those trees.  It had to.  Now I can just do this and fly straight.  That is nice.  There you go.  A little tip to the old left-a-roo there. 
[02:26:00]  There you go.  Everything's good.  Where are you flying to, Jimmy?  I'm going over where those buildings are.  Oh, okay.  You're going to land at an airport?  Absolutely.  I thought I'd love to see.  Okay, it's really tricky here.  Yeah, tricky.  All right.  Oh, there it is.  A few little buildings there.  I don't know what that is.  What are they?  Those are grain silos.  God damn it.  No, no, no.  I'm tipping the wrong way.  Yeah, straighten it out.  Oh, boy.  It ain't moving.  All right.  Suddenly, he's a Kennedy.  Yeah, that's good.  Dude, I can kind of get how that...  Where's the city?  Which way is the city?  How far?  Oh, it's behind you. 
[02:26:30]  Let's bank around there.  All right.  Make a big turn.  Am I banking?  Oh, boy.  There's the grain silos.  There's a highway.  Look at those little cars on the road.  He's actually getting a little better at flying.  I think he is.  Up, up, up.  I just wanted to go up a little bit.  Now, how do I...  I'm still turning around, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, there you go.  Wow.  Follow the highway to the city.  Is every part of the map playable?  Like, can I go...  Yes.  I can go up those mountains?  Yep.  Can I go faster?  It's not just for show. 
[02:27:00]  No, it's not just for show.  It's all...  Some games they are.  I know.  I hate it when you get to that sort of invisible wall.  You're like, I want to keep going that way.  Will we find shit up there, though?  What if I take my hand off the gas?  Yeah, up on top of the mountains.  Will we find some shit up there to fool around with?  We planted little things all over the map to make things interesting.  It's massive.  It is...  It is big.  It's hard to keep it straight.  Yeah, huh?  Yeah.  God, now we're just flying.  Now we're flying with Jimmy.  Jimmy Airlines. 
[02:27:30]  I like this.  That's right.  A fist on every seat.  That's some windmill, a windmill farm.  Yeah, it's Bloomberg's house.  All right.  There it is.  Just kind of navigating his way through the mountains.  Am I going?  Yeah, you're going.  There's...  It takes a while.  I see some buildings.  Yeah, it's a big...  It's a big area to explore.  So even by plane, it takes a little while.  Oh, yeah.  To cross all that.  Well, shit.  We got that a lot in GTA 4.  It's like, why aren't there airplanes? 
[02:28:00]  It's because it's set in a city.  Yeah, yeah.  You're going to fly from Brooklyn to Jersey?  Yeah.  Well, Jimmy, you're coming closer to the city.  I see the buildings there coming through the haze.  Wow, that's pretty cool.  Yeah, they did a really good job with the sort of smoggy look of...  Yeah, yeah.  ...of the downtown area of what is our Los Angeles, but called Los Santos.  What am I doing now?  I'm going to blow it.  Jimmy, where are you going?  I'm going back the other way.  What are you doing?  You got to turn.  He's breaking. 
[02:28:30]  All right.  Jimmy, you're banking too far.  Now I understand all the technology issues that Jimmy's had over the years.  The iPhone is broken.  Live between the buildings, Jimmy.  All right.  As you can see right down there is the Vinewood Bowl.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  Which we call our sort of Hollywood Bowl.  Hollywood Bowl.  Should I fly between buildings?  I'll do that.  Oh, you could.  You can do whatever you want.  It's a big open world for you to explore.  I'm going to have to turn a little right.  I know.  We should...  Uh-oh. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  It's a little low.  We should have Jimmy visit a lady of the night.  Yeah, well...  Wait.  True.  Oh, no.  Don't blow it now.  I'm away from...  I'm flying the wrong way.  You got to go right.  I know.  There you go.  Yeah, we're going right.  Where's the city?  I'm banking to the right.  Keep going.  A little more to the right.  Yeah.  I think it's good when you point your nose.  Oh, boy.  Oh, there you go.  There you go.  Oh, here comes a Mohammed Atta moment.  All right.  There you go.  Wow. 
[02:29:30]  Right toward the buildings.  Right through.  There you go.  Right through those two.  Yeah, that's doable.  You got it, Jimmy.  Oh, he's going to fly between...  I don't know what those buildings are called in the...  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  He started to do a barrel roll in between the two buildings.  He's falling off.  And he smashed right into the side.  Oh, wow.  That's great, man.  Fuck.  That was fun.  Good job, Jimmy.  Yeah, I'm fine.  There you go.  You're fine.  You're tucked in rolls. 
[02:30:00]  All right.  That's funny, man.  Lazlo, always a pleasure, brother.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Absolutely, Lazlo.  Grand Theft Auto 5.

We've reached the top of the Worst of the Week countdown.  I'm Sam Roberts.  You can catch me on the Sam Roberts Show this Sunday, 4 p.m. Eastern this week.  Patrick Wilson from Insidious 2 and Meghan McCain, John McCain's daughter, are both going to be on the show. 
[02:35:00]  It's going to be a great show.  So tune in to that on this channel, 4 p.m. Eastern on Sunday.  But now, I want to play for you the number one bit of the week, Chris Jericho in studio.  How do you get better than that?  He's a wrestler.  He's a rock star.  And he's an entertaining guest on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Judge for yourself.  Here he is, the Ayatollah of rock and roll, a Y2J.  Chris Jericho on the Worst of the Week countdown.  Number one. 
[02:35:30]  What's up with the wrestling?  So you're taking a break or?  My schedule over the last three years has been based around Fozzy.  So I'll go back to wrestling if we have time away from the band.  So I was back for, actually Jimmy came to WrestleMania last time I was here.  Me and Jimmy sat together.  That's right.  You put Fandango over.  Yeah, that's right.  You were the guy that they chose to put Fandango over.  Yeah, it was interesting.  I mean, obviously not the first choice of guys when you're going for WrestleMania,  which is like the biggest show of the fucking year. 
[02:36:00]  And Vince calls me in his office.  And you guys love the Vince invitations.  He's like, Chris, I've got a task for you.  A task that you don't want to do it.  Like, what?  He's like, I'm going to put you with this.  And he goes into his spiel.  And he's like a magician.  He starts weaving.  We were trying to get some new guys on the show.  And we have this new guy.  I think he's got a lot coming to him.  He's got a lot of an upside.  He's really good.  And blah, blah, blah.  And after about five minutes, I'm like, well, which guy are you talking about?  And he's like, Fandango.  I was like, that guy?  Out of all the guys, that guy? 
[02:36:30]  And while he was talking, in the back of my head, I'm like, I hope he doesn't say Fandango.  Oh, shit.  And I'll tell you something else, too.  He got that Fandango gimmick from when I was on Dancing with the Stars.  Because I know he was watching it and thinking, like, these guys are pussies.  You know, like, this would be the ultimate heel, a male dancer.  Okay.  Right?  So that's where he got that from.  So it goes full circle in a way.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  Which was funny, because when I saw you in the hallway, I was like, oh, you turned down  Dancing with the Stars, huh?  Yeah.  And you're like, don't believe everything you see on Twitter.  But he did it so seriously. 
[02:37:00]  Right?  Did you see that?  I know.  I said I turned down Dancing with the Stars, and everyone bought.  Not everyone, but a lot of people.  But the way he tweeted, it was like, now I can finally tell you.  Officially say.  Officially say that I turned down Dancing with the Stars.  Because they were announcing the new lineup on Wednesday.  So on Monday, I said, okay, I can officially tell you I turned them down.  And everyone bought.  Thanks to the producers for giving me, for considering me.  And I'm like Mr. Fan.  I'm like, oh, he's trying out for Dancing with the Stars.  He didn't want to do it.  That's cool.  Of course I wasn't asked.  You guys are getting big, man. 
[02:37:30]  You guys are getting huge.  Well, we did film a little documentary yesterday.  A little scene in the documentary.  Before Dancing with the Stars?  We got things going on.  Kevin Pollack got a little documentary, and he asked us to be in it.  Were you dancing?  We're not dancing.  No dancing.  You should be dancing.  The best was watching Chuck Liddell and Dancing with the Stars.  That was the greatest.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's not meant to dance.  We loved it, though.  And it was literally like watching Put on the Ritz from Young Frankenstein.  It was fucking one of the greatest things I've ever seen.  Gentleman Chuck Liddell was really great. 
[02:38:00]  We're bummed that Fandango started wrestling.  Because that's when we tapped out.  Because we're not into wrestling like we used to when we first met you.  But that brought us back in.  That gimmick was hilarious.  It was such a ridiculous gimmick, right?  But, I mean, obviously he had to wrestle eventually so Vince could get his money's worth.  Well, the thing is, you know, to continue the story we're talking about,  so I found out Fandango's first match ever is in WrestleMania against me.  And it's like, I'm not Steve Austin, but I got enough of a name value.  That's a pretty big position for him to be in. 
[02:38:30]  And it's a lot of pressure because, you know, we've never seen this guy.  We don't know if he's any good, if he's a drizzling shits, what?  But, and the fan, you know, a lot of times when you're wrestling, it's like doing a show.  You want to play your hits so people sing along.  And you throw some new songs in and they're kind of watching.  With him, he had no hits.  He had no moves that anybody knew.  So there was nothing for people to bite on.  Like, you know, you couldn't fake going for the, you know, Stone Cold Stunner  because there was nothing to fake for.  So I had to kind of construct a whole way of building this match over four weeks 
[02:39:00]  to make people give a shit about it.  And I think we did a good job of that because the next night after WrestleMania,  that guy was like the most popular guy in the business  because they're all doing his stupid dance.  And they had this awful theme song that sounded like a dream of Genie.  It was like a knockout.  And it was like a top 30 hit in England on iTunes.  And I guarantee a week and a half after or two weeks later,  everyone was looking at their iPhones and going,  why the fuck did I buy this song? 
[02:39:30]  Yeah, can I erase this, please?  That's when you get a song and put your phone on shuffle.  And like, yeah, this is good, this is good.  What the fuck is this?  What was I thinking?  What was I thinking?  Exactly.  There it is.  Your crack production team killing it, right?  It does sound like a sideways idea.  It does.  It does.  So people would ever do this and they'd sing along with it.  And about a month and a half later, the whole thing was,  it was like the pet rock of wrestling.  It was a huge fat and it just died right afterwards to where now the guy kind of had to start over from scratch 
[02:40:00]  and try and build his way back up again.  But for a while, he was a contender.  He was.  He should have waited a little longer because the heat was pretty strong.  It got good.  Well, a lot of that, too, you know, not to be a jerk, but a lot of that is because he was working with me  and we put together some stuff where he kept kicking the shit out of me and it built good, you know.  So that's what you got to do.  Sometimes you get a task that you're not really all that keen on, but you got to make it work.  But you're number one.  Sam said you were the right guy. 
[02:40:30]  We talked about it before WrestleMania.  And he said you were the right guy for him to do it with.  He said because you're such a veteran.  Like, you'll, I forget how you said it, but you'll make it work with him,  whereas some guys probably wouldn't have handled that well, but you would make it work.  I think it was perfect.  Yeah, I don't know.  It's like a lot of, I have a lot of experience, which a lot of guys don't have.  So you have to use that experience to try, like you said, what's the strengths and what's the weaknesses?  And let's exemplify the strengths and eliminate the weaknesses.  Did I paraphrase you right, Sam?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's like having Sam on your show. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah, exactly.  You got to hide the weaknesses, which is why he's been sitting in the corner of the camera the whole time.  But also, I mean, Jericho's got confidence about him now  because he's been doing it for so long.  He always had the confidence.  But he's not afraid to make somebody else look good.  When you debuted, you were dripping with confidence.  Dripping with confidence.  Dripping with confidence.  Well, that's the thing.  I had nine years of experience before I debuted in the WWE,  working around the world and all these other places.  And that doesn't really exist too much anymore.  You know, guys will go.  They have a big training facility down in Orlando. 
[02:41:30]  Guys will go there for six months or a year and kind of learn a bit.  And then they're on TV to sink or swim on their own.  And when you have eight, nine years' experience, it gives you more options on what to do  and how to get over, I guess you'd say.  But your number one priority now is Fozzy, huh?  Yeah, it has been for the last four years.  We decided in 2009 that we really thought we could do something special with it.  And we've done everything backwards for the way you're supposed to do things.  But it's worked out great, you know, and especially whenever we come to New York.  I mean, the crowds are packed. 
[02:42:00]  And it's just been a really, really cool experience.  Because, like I said, I had a lot of people tell me when we first started this,  same thing I did when I first started wrestling.  You can't do it.  You're too small.  Okay, well, I did it.  Well, you can't be in a band.  You're a wrestler.  Well, why?  You know what I mean?  Bruce Dickinson is an airline pilot, but I don't look at Iron Maiden as the airline pilot's band.  Is he really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And when he's on stage, he's Bruce Dickinson.  And it's the same with us.  We've never been, you know, a wrestling band that was running around singing about jumping off the top rope  and spandex and turnbuckles and stuff.  Wait, what kind of airline pilot?  I'm sorry. 
[02:42:30]  Did he fly missions into Afghanistan or something recently?  He wasn't in the military.  No, he's a commercial airline pilot for an airline in England called, like, Our House or something,  some Swedish airline.  Active, though?  Yeah, well, he actually flies Iron Maiden's plane when they go.  They did a tour a couple years ago in a big F-16.  I don't know.  I'll pretend I know about military.  It's an F-16 bomber that they gutted the insides out.  And it was a giant plane that they took all of the insides out, put, like, 30 first-class seats, 
[02:43:00]  and then the back was all their gear.  Palleted, huge stage, giant, yeah.  Giant Eddie, everything.  And they would fly from, okay, we're flying from England to Jakarta, Jakarta to Russia,  Russia to Japan, Japan to L.A., L.A. to Brazil.  And Bruce flew it through the plane.  He's like Travolta.  He's a legit pilot.  Well, he's nothing like Travolta, other than the fact that he's a pilot.  Well, yeah, you hope he picks a different massage of scenarios. 
[02:43:30]  Yes, Bruce isn't a closet gay Scientologist.  We used to talk to Bruce.  We haven't had him on in a while, man.  I wanted to talk to him on a trip, yeah.  Yeah, I would love to talk to him again.  He's a fucking great front man.  I mean, I'm listening to fucking, like, Aces High the other day.  I'm like, this guy's just fucking great.  Well, yeah, not like him.  He sings it better now than he did, you know, in 1985, which is even better, too, because  that's some high vocals he has to sing.  Why did Paul Deano leave, to get on a weird metal tangent, why did Paul Deano leave Maynard?  Did they throw him out?  They threw him out.  Oh, they did.  For what reason?  Alcohol.  And plus, he just wasn't the right guy for the band. 
[02:44:00]  But I think there's a lot of personality issues.  He wanted to be the leader, and I think he was an alcoholic, too.  Oh, okay.  And Steve Harris is like Vince, like, no fucking around.  You're either in or you're out, and then no remorse when you get rid of somebody.  I still find it weird when they throw a bandmate out that isn't, you know, drinking or drugging.  Yeah.  It seems just a little weird from where we grew up, right?  Right.  It's hard, though, like, being in a band.  We have five guys in Fozzy, and it's a five-way marriage.  It really is.  And every band has the two alpha males, and you can look at any big band in history. 
[02:44:30]  It's Mick and Keith, and it's Tyler and Perry, and it's Steve Harris and Bruce Dickinson,  or, you know, Lars and James, or whatever.  There's always the two guys, Tony and Ozzy, that are like the bosses.  And then the other guys play their part.  It's like any corporation.  You have the guys, thank you, you have the guys that are your boss, and then you have  the guy whose job is this, the guy whose job is that, and if the guy whose job is this  wants to be the boss, it doesn't work.  Well, Nigel, yeah, they're like fire and ice, and I'm like lukewarm water. 
[02:45:00]  I feel like a preserved loose on stage.  But that's what it's like, so when you get, when everybody knows, you know, as the Rock  used to say, what do you say, know your role or whatever?  If you know your role in a band, it's great.  Like Paul Stanley says, a band is not a democracy.  It's not a place for being a democracy.  There's Paul and Gene, call the shots, and Ace and Peter, whoever the other guys are in  the band at the time, do their parts, but that's it.  Right.  And so when you have a band where somebody starts getting too big for their britches 
[02:45:30]  and starts stepping outside of the role of what they're supposed to do, sometimes that  starts causing friction, which is going to cause the whole machine to crash, and that  becomes a cancer, and that's when you have to get rid of somebody, and that's why it  starts.  I'm obsessed with your shirt, by the way.  He's got a great painted shirt.  Yeah, he says he walked in.  Beautiful fucking shirt.  I got this in Calgary at a flea market.  I wanted my own Paul Stanley solo shirt, but he couldn't find them, so I went and got the  guy to airbrush it, and when I first got this, it was super stiff, so it had like a  bulletproof vest. 
[02:46:00]  Do you ever have a shirt?  I used to hate those shirts.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But do you ever have a shirt or something where you had it, and you wore it for a while, and  then you got lost at the back of the closet, and you forgot about it, and you find it like  eight years later?  Like, this was this shirt.  I just found it like a year ago, and I was like, holy shit.  It's crackling like an old painting.  It's amazing.  1994 is when this shirt was made.  Do you wash that or have it dry cleaned?  That sounds like a dumb question, but that's a nice shirt.  No, I never even, I was too stupid to even think of a dry clean.  I mean, that's why it's kind of cracked, but yeah, it's pretty right, man.  It's kind of cool that it's cracked.  Yeah.  It's the Paul Stanley solo album, for those of you who don't even know, which are still 
[02:46:30]  the four coolest covers.  It was released the same day?  It was released the same day.  Aces was the best, I think.  You think?  Yeah.  I like Aces.  I like Paul's the best with Aces sound.  Paul's is amazing.  Wait, some guy just freehand fucking airbrushed that?  Airbrushed this, yeah.  In a flea market, dude.  In a flea market.  Do they have flea markets anymore?  I mean, I don't know.  Not as many.  They're all movie theaters now.  Yeah, just go on eBay or something.  That's a dog.  Call back.  Artists just don't get any respect.  No, no.  There's amazing talent out there, and they have to go to a flea market to try to make 
[02:47:00]  a few bucks.  That guy should not be in a flea market, right?  This is great, right?  He should be doing rock and roll paintings for your house.  It's incredible.  You see the sketch artists in Central Park?  They make amazing sketches of people just dumb tourists, and I'm like, that guy should  be making a shitload of money somewhere.  Instead, he's getting, like, what, 10, 15 bucks to sit in a crate.  It's unbelievable.  But, I mean, how much money could you make for that?  How many could you do in a day?  10?  That's true.  Right.  Maybe.  So if you do 10, and how much is it?  20 bucks?  Yeah, he's making 200 bucks.  Then there's supplies.  There's box rental. 
[02:47:30]  Shake downs.  You know, what's that?  Shake downs.  Shake downs.  I'm going to have a shirt made.  I'm going to fucking have a shirt made.  You should.  That is beautiful, man.  We got guys that listen to our show that would probably make something nice like that.  I'm going to get a couple of different ones.  Because that's a unique, one-off fucking Jericho shirt.  It would be cool to get all guys that ever wore a kiss makeup and have a Vinnie Vincent  Onk Man.  That would be the shit.  The Onk Man.  Vinnie Vincent Onk Man.  The Onk Man.  The Halloween costumes didn't go through the roof on the Onk Man. 
[02:48:00]  You were talking about your son outside the studio.  He's nine already.  My son is nine.  Because I remember when you were having a kid when we first got back to radio.  Yeah.  We've been back nine years.  Well, you guys came back in 03 or 02?  04-ish.  Yeah.  So I had just had him.  He was born in 03.  Yeah.  I remember you talking about it at the time.  And now he's nine.  Nine.  And do you want to tell that story?  Yeah.  All right.  I wasn't sure how.  We were talking about Sabbath.  Sabbath.  And you brought your nine-year-old.  Yeah.  And first of all, isn't it crazy how long we've had a relationship on this show? 
[02:48:30]  Like 13 fucking years, man.  14.  That's crazy.  That's longer than most marriages last.  So congratulations, guys.  I'll buy you a bouquet of flowers later.  So I took my son to the Stones in June.  We went to Boston.  Flew up father-son.  I'm not much of a camper or like a woodsman.  And I remember my dad used to take me camping when I was a kid.  And I was like, ah, fuck that.  I'll take him to the Stones.  That's a cool thing for a dad and son.  You are.  And we had the best time.  The Stones killed it.  I don't know if you guys saw them.  They're still killing it?  Mick is 70.  And he sings like he's 50. 
[02:49:00]  He sings great.  He's still doing his Mick shit and doing the, you know, and he was so damn good.  And he had a blast.  He knew the songs because I played him some good ones.  So I said, well, do you want to go to Sabbath?  They're coming to Tampa.  And he's like, okay, I'd like to go to Sabbath.  You know, I'm going to go.  And I said, well, Ozzy swears a lot.  He's like, it's okay, Dad.  I've heard it before.  He plays Call of Duty.  And, you know, so my wife and I said, okay, well, he can, let's give it a try.  Right.  So I took him there.  And, of course, the opening line is, I want to see a wild fucking crowd, you fuckers. 
[02:49:30]  And he's kind of like a little bit timid.  But, you know, he's getting up to War Pigs is the opening number.  And he's clapping with Ozzy.  And he's doing the Ozzy stuff.  And I'm watching him out of the corner of the eye because if I look at him, he'll stop.  And he's into it.  And then the third song in was Under the Sun, kind of an obscure tune.  Could be my favorite Sabbath song ever.  Really?  Mine, too, until they have these big video screens on the side of the stage, as most bands do nowadays.  But instead of showing, like, you know, oh, here's Geezer playing and here's Ozzy, they've 
[02:50:00]  got these, like, blasphemous, crazy images from, like, the Hammer horror films of the  late 60s, early 70s when there was no, like, code.  Right.  There was no, like, you know, ratings.  So I was watching this.  And it was like, I couldn't believe it.  There was, there's nothing like watching two nuns covered in blood jacking off a cross  with your nine-year-old son.  And they're making out, too.  And so I was kind of looking, and I can see that he's, I remember, like, I remember if  I was ever watching a movie with my parents, and there was, like, boobs. 
[02:50:30]  Oh, yeah.  I remember when we saw the deep at the drive-in with my parents, and they thought I was sleeping,  but the boobs were, like, Jacqueline Bissette's boobs.  And that white t-shirt.  Yeah, remember?  And I'm like, I hope they don't notice that I'm looking, because I don't want to have this  conversation right now.  I'm only seven.  So I'm looking over, and he's seeing all this stuff, and he's not really, I don't know,  like, Jimmy said you didn't even notice any of this stuff.  No, I was so transfixed on Ozzy, they literally could have been showing my fucking face, and  I wouldn't have noticed that.  But you can give them the boobs.  So then the next one that comes up is Jesus on the cross, with a giant serpent circling 
[02:51:00]  the cross and devouring him, legs up.  Like, I was uncomfortable, even if me and Norton were watching it, I'd feel weird.  Never mind with my nine-year-old son.  And it was starting to get pretty bad, and I was like, you know what?  Do you want to go?  And he's like, I'm kind of tired, maybe we should go.  And I said, yeah, we should go, but I want to stay until Fairies Wear Boots.  You know, we covered that on our last record.  It's always my favorite Sabbath song.  And, of course, Fairies Wear Boots come on, and then it was like, now they've got, like, 
[02:51:30]  the Jim Rose Circus Freak Show, where they've got the hooks in the back of the guy's  traps, and they're lifting him off the ground, and they've got these naked chicks spinning  on chains, and I was like, maybe we should go.  So we had to do, and the worst thing was, was the walk of shame out of the sold-out  amphitheater, as everybody knows, like, ooh, bad father.  Bad parental decision.  Bad parental decision.  And we walk out, and, you know, what do you say?  Like, I didn't really know what to say.  And my son is like, he's like, you know what, Dad? 
[02:52:00]  Next time we go out somewhere, I'm going to pick the place, because that didn't work out  too well.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, there's certain images, but at least as a father, I respect that.  Like, if there's something that you feel is age-inappropriate or whatever, you go, ah,  let's just go.  Like, you're not complaining or saying they shouldn't do it.  He's just go, ah, you've got to know your kid.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I respect that.  He likes music, and it wasn't, the music was great.  It was, it was, it was just the imagery.  Right.  And one thing in the story, it was the imagery, which, like I said, it was just, it was  confused me as to why they did it, because, you know, they're not Demu Borgi or some 
[02:52:30]  satanic death band.  I mean, it was their thing in the 70s, but it wasn't like, you know, Oz, he's throwing  water and doing the, oh, like his, you know, doing the windmill thing.  And meanwhile, in the background, there's like some, you know, lady having an abortion or  whatever the hell was going on.  And it was kind of, and it was funny, I was talking to Zach Wilde about it, and he goes,  I guarantee Oz doesn't even know what's on behind him.  Really?  You don't think he does?  Unless he turns around for a drink, he said, all he cares about now is what time does  the show start, and what time can he be back in the hotel room to watch the History  Channel?  History Channel.  Still watching that History Channel.  Loves the History Channel. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah, I didn't, I did not notice any of the imagery.  Like, I was looking up, but most of the time I was just watching the fucking guys.  But you're a Sabbath fanatic.  Yeah.  Have you seen them play before?  Oh, yeah.  Okay, so many times.  But to go, it was like, kind of like, oh, this year, here.  I went twice this year.  I had to see them.  It just, it was more, the one I wanted to see the most was Naomi, because he's sick,  and I'm like, I don't know how many, I mean, hopefully he'll be okay.  Well, them as a band, I mean, obviously I think Ozzy will tour again, but, but Sabbath, this  could be the end of it, right?  Maybe, yeah.  I mean, I would hope not, the band, it was such a massive success.  How was Ozzy when you saw them? 
[02:53:30]  He was great.  I mean, the, I saw them twice, and he was great both times.  They did a shorter set in Irvine, because it was later in the tour.  Right.  And I think it was the tour drag song.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They cut a lot of new songs, too.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I need a better copy of that fucking, uh.  How great is that?  We're looking at a picture of Jimmy interviewing Black Sabbath.  Yeah, that's cool.  Norton the douchebag wearing a suit jacket.  It's like, I'm going to visit, I'm going to go interview Sabbath.  I have to look the part.  I know what?  At Ozzy's home.  That's Ozzy's house, yeah.  Oh, wow.  I bought the jacket, the pants, I bought everything for that. 
[02:54:00]  And I didn't know what to, I wore a black t-shirt.  I wanted to, because it's for their DVD, so I wanted to wear something that was kind  of, I didn't want to wear a fucking rock t-shirt.  Right.  And I didn't know what to get, so I'm like, just a jacket and some black pants.  That's huge, man.  That's so cool.  You know, that's one of the things, like, um, you know, we were talking earlier about  how you get to become friends with your heroes.  And that's pretty cool that you're in Ozzy's house.  I've never, I've never been in Ozzy's house before, but that's pretty damn cool,  man.  Yeah, that's, I've been to think, you know, when you were 15.  Jim Florentine left me a message, he goes, remember you were calling England, jet records  to try to meet him? 
[02:54:30]  I used to call England in 1981.  And now you're in his house, you're an asshole.  Yeah.  I can never tell Ozzy that he'll get creeped out.  Yeah.  You probably shouldn't be in Ozzy's house.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's the second house of his I've been in.  The first one was that we shot the opening to the special, it was his old house.  Wow.  In his bathroom.  Listen to Norton house dropping.  That's the second house, I think you.  The first one was much nicer.  Believe me, it's a big drop after Ozzy.  It goes from Ozzy to Opie and Anthony in the next two big houses.  I remember an embarrassing fucking moment. 
[02:55:00]  I went to go see Saturday Night Fever and I'm sitting between my mom and my grandmother.  And it's like, you know, that part, you're happy now you're a cunt, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And they're like fucking gangbanging that chick in the back seat.  And I swear, I was just like, I was jerking off.  I was so fucking uncomfortable, man.  It was like...  Well, now fast forward.  I can put myself in your mom's shoes.  I'm sure she was even more uncomfortable. 
[02:55:30]  And what do you say?  Like, there's nothing to say.  You're kind of...  You don't want to fucking talk about it.  Did you say anything on the way home?  I didn't really say, like, you know, what did you think of those images, son?  I just said, you know, it was pretty heavy and some of the stuff you probably shouldn't have seen.  You know, and he was...  Don't tell mom.  Yeah, don't tell mom.  Yeah, I pretty much did say that, don't tell mom.  But conversely, she had taken, I believe him and our nephew, who was 11, to Lady Gaga.  Oh, okay.  Which was, you know, Fire Island times a thousand, where I guess one of the opening lines was, like, I want you to suck, I want all of you to suck my cock. 
[02:56:00]  And she's a chick, you know, and they're like, same thing, don't tell your mom.  And two of us raised our hands and cheered.  Yeah, so, I mean, that's the thing, you know, like you said, sometimes you...  I mean, I was talking to Jose from Octane, and he was saying that his daughter loved it.  So, you know, and Charlie Benanti took his daughter to Gaga, because they're friends, and he said he just covered her ears at certain points and stuff.  So, you've got to figure out what your kid can do.  You know, yeah, we all grow up in different... 
[02:56:30]  I remember when I was a kid, I was about seven, and I went to one of those live haunted houses.  My mom took me in, because she thought it would be a lark.  I thought that we'd have a fun time.  Yeah, sure.  And I'll never forget...  Fuck, dude, I remember it as clear as day, and it was 32 years ago or whatever.  There was a lady in a bathtub filled with blood.  And I was so scared, I was just screaming at this point.  My mom had to carry me, and I was, like, probably eight at that point, so I was, like, not, like, not that carryable.  And I remember the lady looked up in the bathtub, and she had this look of, like, pure compassion. 
[02:57:00]  She was, like, oh, and she smiled, like, it's okay.  But the lady, covered in blood, in the bathtub, smiling at me, freaked me out even more than a horse.  Look at that, she's smiling at me!  So, I'm sure, you know, 30 years from now, when you guys are still on the fucking airwaves, and my son is on, he'll tell you, you know, my dad took me to Sabbath once,  and a nun was jerking off a cross, covered in blood, making out with another nun.  The other one was Barbarella.  Barbarella fucking had a drive-in, my father and his, like, girlfriend at the time. 
[02:57:30]  And I'm sitting there, and it was the beginning part where she's kind of naked, and, like, flipping through space and shit.  And I remember, like, trying not to breathe heavy.  I was fucking, like, so fucking turned on, and I'm like, ah, this is weird!  That was so weird.  That's the best we got from last week.  I mean, that's the best we have from the past week.

Gomez and Kelly Festuga.  Yay, baby.  Todd. 
[03:02:30]  And then everybody else is after them.  Even Ro.  We got Louis J. Gomez in the house.  What's up, Lou?  What's up, motherfucker?  We got Devin.  I don't know your last name.  Ricci.  Devin Ricci, who is a...  Christina Ricci's brother.  What the...  Fucking Louis.  First of all, pull that shoulder sleeve down.  I don't want to look at that.  Muscles.  Fonzie in the house.  Hey.  Sit on it.  Listen.  What is your title?  What would you give yourself if you had to give yourself a title? 
[03:03:00]  As a job?  Yep.  That would be it.  Yep.  Not as a fucking prince.  That's a great job voice right there.  I'm a graphic designer and a web developer, but I'm also a chef.  Really?  Yes.  So that's what you do now is graphic design and web design.  Yes.  Do you work for a company?  Do you work for yourself?  I do both.  Really?  I might need somebody.  Is this podcast interviewing dudes now?  I did Kelly's and Dan's site.  Oh, good.  Well, you know what?  Forget it. 
[03:03:30]  That was the indie one.  I do.  So you do food, and you're actually...  We're going to get to you in a second.  Yes.  You brought in some food for me today.  A lot.  Because I'm a fat fuck.  That's what I was on the cast.  All right.  Hey, listen.  Fucking...  Trying to figure out why we're interviewing...  I didn't know why we were interviewing a dude.  Push that microphone down.  Just dude.  Push it down.  Pull it down.  He's like, hey, Bobby, I got a friend.  You want to come in?  Listen, first of all...  He's middle management somewhere.  Dude, I saw this guy emptying this vending machine.  I figured it might be an interesting chat. 
[03:04:00]  My buddy works for the MTA.  Killer interview.  Dude, my buddy saw The Killers Live last summer.  He wants to talk about it.  You want to come in?  You're making my eye hurt, Bobby.  And, of course, we got Joe.  List, a.k.a.  The fucking truth.  You skipped Giannis.  I wanted to be the most important guy.  He's more important than me.  No.  Look at his posture alone.  No, his fucking internet characters are.  Oh, God.  You know what?  Dealing with you fucking guys. 
[03:04:30]  It's nice to be here.  It's nice to see you.  Oh, good.  Well, thank you for coming, and thank you for being a part of the show.  I love being a part of the show.  I take it very serious.  Well, you are part of it.  You're on the poster.  Which poster?  The poster I gave everybody.  Oh.  You get yours, right?  I'll show it to you.  Anyways, we got, and we got, of course, Giannis.  Giannis, what's up?  Everybody out there who hates me, who listens to this podcast.  Well, do they hate you?  Really?  I get tons of, yeah.  You got a lot of, like...  Racist listeners?  Yeah, a lot of, like, yeah.  It's only you have an ONA crowd, dude. 
[03:05:00]  Well, no, here's the deal.  First of all...  They love to hate me, though.  They love me.  No, well, here's the thing.  You, last time we talked, you, me and Joe, I believe it was, we were having the pizza  party.  We were throwing in quips as you two fucking assholes went at it about the Zimmerman trial,  and me and Joe just sat there and let you guys go at it so we could have more pizza than  you.  Very quick.  Very quick.  Yeah, so...  Yeah, that's what happened.  Yeah, the last time he was very...  Listen, if you're not going to hold the microphone, fucking go home.  How's that sound?  He laid it on his chair. 
[03:05:30]  I allow you...  I figured out a good way to do it.  I know that you're in a fucking depression.  Okay?  I know what's going...  Listen, I know life's tough sometimes.  This is a perfect...  No, that's not, because it makes me want to not talk.  Yeah, dude, Jessie Mae's holding her mic, I'll guarantee you that.  Oh!  Just jump right into it, huh?  Wow.  Wow.  She actually probably has somebody holding it for her.  Go fuck yourself, Jay.  Who's Jay?  And it's not a mic.  No! 
[03:06:00]  I don't know what that meant.  It was a pee-pee.  Is that what it was?  I don't know.  I just said a thing.  I was like, oh, that one's stuck, and everyone went, whoa!  And we got Rotem, this is her last day today.  And she's very gorgeous.  That's her last day here?  She's 21, Joe.  Yeah.  She's 21.  What are you talking about, 21?  Easy.  She's a little old, I get it, but she's hard.  You ever hear that joke?  My friend told me this joke.  The two pedophiles sitting around talking, an eight-year-old walks by, and then one guy  goes, whoa, look at that.  And the other one goes, yeah, she must have been something in her day. 
[03:06:30]  And I love Joe.  Joe just bring out an old bar joke.  Thanks for letting us know why you love him.  I love him for that reason.  I'm so glad we know that now.  Oh, what's the other one?  Oh, there's a priest.  Priest, and I heard two pedophile jokes this afternoon.  While you're holding this fucking break.  While you're hanging out with Giannis?  Priest, priest, and pedophile.  Why don't you get this?  Hey, hey, somebody get this on video.  This would be a nice thing to get on fucking video.  Don't you think?  Last day, I don't give a shit.  Yeah, she's got senioritis right now. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah, what are you doing, Ro?  So there's a priest and a...  You got it?  Jesus Christ.  Go ahead.  Action.  There's a priest and a rabbi hanging out at this home for the children, children's home  or whatever, and all of a sudden it breaks out into a big fire.  Yeah.  And the priest is like, we should go save the kids.  And the rabbi's like, ah, fuck them.  And the priest goes, you think we have time?  We should have filmed the first one.  The first one was a pro.  She's tired today.  She's leaving.  She's very sexy. 
[03:07:30]  All right.  We're not doing this.  She watched my baby this afternoon.  21 years old.  She was at my apartment.  21 is like six years older than what would be creepy to be.  Three years younger than what I like to bang on the road.  You hear that, Jesse?  He's getting road pussy.  You know what, dude?  Shut up.  I mean, Louis J. Gomez.  What?  Don't say that.  Don't worry.  She's too big to listen to this podcast.  Listen.  I know.  She's too big.  I probably couldn't even get her on here.  You have to call.  Yeah, you have to call her people. 
[03:08:00]  What the fuck happened to you in Etterborough?  This is funny because I go, Kelly, I want Giannis on the show.  Get him on.  No, he's not around for a while.  He's in fucking.  He's in Scotland.  I'm like, no, he's not.  He's like, oh, no, he's not.  He's back in Brooklyn.  What the fuck happened?  How many times did I text or call you like, hey, Bobby, can you talk?  You got a second?  Really?  Yeah.  You were unwinding?  Well, yeah.  I mean, I'm back 17 days early, so you don't think things go great.  17 days. 
[03:08:30]  That's why.  I thought you were away.  What happened?  I was supposed to be away at 26.  Yeah.  I love Kelly's fucking inquisitive.  It was a fucking disaster is what it was.  What happened?  To explain, people, first of all, we got to go.  Etterborough is a festival that a lot of comics have been to, but people think it's not  like the Montreal Festival where you get paid, you're flown up, you get a hotel, you get a  little money for your pocket, and you do great shows, and everybody in the fucking world  is up there.  It's more like you have to go to Scotland, you have to fly yourself there, you have to  put yourself up. 
[03:09:00]  Everything is on you, but you have an opportunity to make a lot of money if you...  If the press likes you, you get to work in England and make money.  Edinburgh is the hardest festival in the world.  There's two and a half thousand shows competing in a small town.  Well, here's what I have to say.  My true honesty...  Can I ask a question?  How the fuck...  Why are you asking what happened and about the festival?  Because I know so many people who have a really hard time in Edinburgh, and I'm interested  to see how you've had a hard time.  Well, that's because anyone can go.  Anyone can...  It is my...  Wait a minute.  Kelly can go? 
[03:09:30]  Yeah.  Anyone can go.  What would that show be?  It's a Barker Festival.  I could go.  Talk into the microphone, Devin.  Jesus Christ.  Can't you hear yourself?  It's how you yell at everybody, guys.  It makes me feel comfortable.  Okay, good.  Pull your sleeve down.  I don't like how his fucking eyebrow and his shoulder are up on the same side.  It's called presenting.  Oh, I know.  He knows it all about that.  Yeah, so you go out there. 
[03:10:00]  Now, nobody invites you.  Who came up with the idea of you going to Edinburgh?  My agent.  Okay, and your agent said you should go to Edinburgh and do what?  What show are you going to do?  My agent said, right when I signed with him, he said...  Can you do your agent's character?  Hi, I'm your agent.  Louie Katz is your agent?  No.  We have the same agent.  Me and Louie Katz have the same agent.  So, when I signed with him, he was like, I can get you into Edinburgh.  They want you.  You have to give me a decision by the time you get off the plane from L.A. to New York. 
[03:10:30]  Wow.  So, and I didn't...  My gut was telling me not to do it, but it was one of those things, you know, when you're a comic,  you come up through the fucking years, you're like...  Explain that to Louis.  Louis.  You feel like you got to...  You don't want to miss an opportunity.  You feel like you want to take it.  Right.  You feel like, I don't want to...  Fuck it, I'll just do it.  I'll just...  Yes.  You know, you always say yes to stuff.  Yes.  So, that's how it happened.  And then I went, and that was that.  So, you said, yeah.  Now, how do you muster up all this money to get the... 
[03:11:00]  How do you figure out how much you need?  Where are you going to stay?  What theater?  Who does all that?  Girl code.  Jesus, Louis.  Cut him some slack.  We're going to get into that.  Oh, yeah.  Wait for the fucking beating that's coming.  Wait for the man when he's down.  Oh, shit.  Yannis is going to kill himself on this podcast.  He can barely hold the microphone in his hand.  I'm okay.  I'm actually good.  I'm doing great.  This is awkward for me, because Yannis and I have hung up for the last two hours,  sort of fucking serious about...  Yeah.  ...and now it's my job to just fucking hammer him.  Undo everything you just told them to do. 
[03:11:30]  All right.  So, who does all that?  So, that's my management.  Who's your management again?  Dave and Chris, the stand owners.  Oh, the owners of a comedy club.  Of the stand.  And a restaurant.  Yeah.  And their management.  Yeah.  Okay.  Nice talking to you.  How much for the steak and cheese and panamas?  Hang on one second, Yannis.  I'm working out your hotel.  We're going to do a sale today, and then we're going to have the open mics. 
[03:12:00]  Tell them in the back of the room.  Okay.  Where's Patrick from Grinch Huber?  They're a little more Guido Italian than that, though.  It's got to be like a nice fucking...  Yannis, what we did, we got you a deal.  The new Steinbergs.  The new and improved.  They're not Jewish.  They're Italian.  They're not Jew brothers.  They're law brothers.  Yannis, we fucking love you.  We got a club. 
[03:12:30]  We took Barry Katz and Jason Steinberg, and we mushed them together.  Oh, God.  I'm getting rid of my management.  Tomorrow.  So, what happened?  Make sure you call them after four, because the delivery...  I'm not doing lunch.  You fucking managers have a lunch rush.  Yannis, I'm in the weeds right now.  Let me call you back. 
[03:13:00]  Too many orders on the board.  86th, the funny bone.  Oh, God.  I hate this podcast already.  This is not going to be one of my favorite episodes.  There will be no...  This podcast will not be named after something I say.  That's the name of it.  That's the name.  Write that name down.  This name will not be something I say.  Listen to me, Yannis.  Oh, my God.  Oh, fuck. 
[03:13:30]  Yannis.  You know how every single listener who disagreed with me about Trayvon Martin last podcast is loving every fucking moment of this.  Yeah, they are.  You are the new Trayvon.  Yeah.  You guys can go down to meet his management at noon.  There's a special.  It's called the Yannis Papas.  It's a Greek salad without the feta.  Oh, shit.  Oh, God.  I can do fucking... 
[03:14:00]  Yannis, I'm in the weeds.  Hang on one second.  You know what would be great?  Why don't we call them and ask...  If your management had an office instead of a bar?  Why don't we call them and ask them their perspective?  Yannis, how many people had they...  That would be fucking great.  How many people have they ever sent to Edinburgh, like their clients?  I think I was the fucking...  Did I speak to you about Edinburgh a few weeks ago? 
[03:14:30]  I don't think so.  I don't know.  What, you were giving me tips?  I think at LOL one night we were talking about it and I was saying, just because I grew up...  Like, in comedy in Melbourne, everyone goes to Edinburgh and just all the horror stories.  I wish I had to put you in touch with people and talk to them before.  I wish I would have spoken with people.  Kelly, Yannis, that's how far down your career has gone.  No, no, shut up.  Kelly Kastuka is giving you advice right now.  I'm not the one giving you advice.  I'm putting you in touch with people that have done five, six of them.  Kelly, are you out of your fucking mind?  Is your self-esteem that shitty that he just said that to you? 
[03:15:00]  And you went, no, it's not me giving him advice.  I'm going to hook him up with people who can give advice.  I've never been.  It's okay to give advice, Kelly.  You're a fucking adult.  Don't let this Puerto Rican with shit tattoos bully you.  All right?  Yeah.  Stick up for yourself.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm getting letter after letter after letter about how fucking Kelly's funny and you guys  should lay off her and I saw her the other night.  She killed and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  No, of course not.  I'm funny to see these letters.  Hold on.  The people that think Kelly's funny still write letters. 
[03:15:30]  On quills?  Dearest Robert.  Dearest Robert.  It showed up tied to a pigeon's foot.  Fucking you laughed at it.  You can't make fun of it if you laugh at it.  I'm still laughing at Joe.  Yeah.  We're all kind of, you kind of tagged on Joe's laugh.  It's on a pigeon's foot.  It's on a bomb, though.  Yeah, well, you know, it was close.  People laugh.  Oh, if it was just by itself, if you weren't on the tail end of a bunch of funny ones,  you would have been fucking, I would have put you in the other room.  You know what?  Facing the wall.  You know what?  What, Dad? 
[03:16:00]  I wasn't.  So anyway, so you go to, I don't really want to call them.  That's going to be a nightmare.  Could be funny, though.  Really?  Well, call them.  To hear them try to justify it.  Well, what happened?  Tell me what you think happened.  What happened?  Yeah, I didn't have the fucking, I didn't have the right game plan.  They didn't know what they were doing.  My management didn't put me in a great position.  What position should you have been in?  Doggy style.  Well, first of all, a lot of people that go out there don't pay their own way.  They're brought out by the companies that bring people out. 
[03:16:30]  Oh, you weren't one of those.  I was not one of them.  How can you get in with one of those companies?  I don't know how that happens.  I don't know.  It just kind of happens.  Why wouldn't you find that out first?  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  Were you a festival-managed venue?  Yeah, festival-managed venue.  What does that mean?  Explain that.  Kelly, don't just say shit that we have to ask.  You know I'm going to have to go, what is that?  Just explain it, you fucking...  There's a couple of companies.  There's a couple of companies.  Assembly, Gilded Balloon, a few of them that bring people out that have their own sort of festivals. 
[03:17:00]  There's like a bunch of, like three or four companies that are involved in the festival.  So I was brought out with Assembly.  I was under Assembly.  So somebody brought you out?  You just said that?  Yeah, but they brought me out on my dollar.  They didn't produce me.  Why wouldn't they produce you?  Because they fucking probably didn't want me.  I got no heat or whatever the fuck.  Wait a minute.  You don't need heat to get produced in Edinburgh.  No.  I don't know.  I've seen people go out there with no heat.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't have the answer to that.  Okay, so you go...  No heat.  Wonder why Christmas missed us.  Birthdays was the worst days.  Now we sip champagne when we're thirsty. 
[03:17:30]  Damn right I like the life I live.  Yo.  Because I went from negative to positive.  And it's all good.  And if you don't know, then you know, nigga.  Hey.  I said it as big.  Come on, bro.  We decided, remember?  It's a rule.  What?  If you're Biggie's size, you can say it.  That was a good one. 
[03:18:00]  Don't fucking...  Don't circus laugh at me.  That was really good.  That was a good one.  You look good though, Bob.  You look good.  Shut the fuck up.  Shut the fuck up.  You look nice.  Oh, God.  You look nice.  Guys, come on.  Stop.  You're killing me.  All right.  Back to Giannis.  Sad Giannis.  But you had to be going into this with, oh, my God, great expectations.  You're leaving the States, which is a good thing.  You know, you're going over to Edinburgh, which is an honor to do. 
[03:18:30]  A lot of people have done it.  You get there.  When did you know this is going bad?  First moment I got there.  Why?  Because I met the guy that I hired to do PR, and the first minute I met him, I knew that  it wasn't going to work.  What was he like?  Hello, I'm Duncan McClendon McClendon McClendon.  How do you want him?  I looked your name on the good and paid you on the party.  He's American.  He's American.  Oh, so he didn't have that answer.  And the first thing he told me was like, you got to walk through this party.  Let's walk around. 
[03:19:00]  There's a lot of important people here.  I'm like, oh, boy.  Oh, man.  This guy's full of shit.  And so, you know.  Yeah, but he's full of shit.  You know, there's one thing I remember that when I was in L.A. for a while, and Dane used  to call me up all the time and be like, you know, you got to go.  There's this party.  And I'd be like, I don't want to fucking go.  I don't want to do this shit.  He's like, you got to.  I haven't talked to Colin about this.  He even said that in his speech.  You got to.  There's a certain amount.  Look, as comics, we want to be recognized.  We want to be respected for the art. 
[03:19:30]  We want all this shit.  We want people to come to us.  There's a certain amount of smooching.  Smooching?  This was different, though.  Smooching.  Smoozing.  Smoozing.  What is it?  Smoozing.  I fucked all you guys up.  Smoozing.  It's smoozing.  Smoozing.  Smoozing.  What is it?  Smoozing.  Smoozing.  Smoozing.  That's smooching.  You're just kissing dudes in the corner of the party.  There's a certain amount of ass kissing you have to do in this business.  You have to go to the party.  You have to hang out. 
[03:20:00]  You have to do those stupid things.  Smile and learn how to do it.  But this was different, though.  Okay.  Why was it different?  Because it was just a dumb party that was way crowded, and there was nobody important  there, and that doesn't matter out there.  It's not an issue.  What matters out there is you get people in your show, you get reviews, you get interviews,  and you get those interviews and reviews to get people in your show.  You've got to get some buzz going.  Can we call your PR guy?  I want to hear his perspective.  You've got to get some...  He's like, you got off the plane.  I said, hey, let's go schmooze at the party a little bit.  He's like, no.  I'm like, why? 
[03:20:30]  It's like important people.  The first thing my PR guy did was when we were making...  What I heard is my partner was making the flyer.  You have a partner?  Yeah, my business partner.  Oh.  It's just Marisa.  Bobby, do you like this picture?  He paints half his face like Victor Victor.  So the first thing he said is he was trying to tell Jesse when he was designing the flyer  to put some fake stars on there.  He was like, put some fake reviews on there.  And he was like, I'm not doing that.  I'm not fucking lying on the flyer.  What if somebody researches it?  Put some fake reviews on the internet. 
[03:21:00]  Just have me tweet fucking fascinating results.  But you know what?  If that's someone's game plan who you're paying a lot of money, then you're fucked.  Yeah, I agree with that.  When comments buy their Twitter followers, people do that all the time.  They buy their YouTube views or Twitter followers.  If the guy you're paying says, here's our game plan.  Lie on your flyer.  That's the way we're going to start.  Oh, so you obviously don't have any juice to sell me.  I mean, is it a flyer or a liar?  You know what I mean? 
[03:21:30]  Oh, the visual element's lost here.  It's true.  Yeah, we could have had it if fucking Ro wasn't on fucking, I'm leaving today to fucking energy.  She's very attractive.  Shut up.  She's not attractive.  You're attractive, but not to, you know what I mean.  You're pretty.  You're a pretty young girl.  Dig up.  You're not attractive.  I love Ro's face.  You know what I mean, Ro.  Notice how the people with kids actually has respect for her.  You have beautiful eyes.  I have no respect for her.  You're a beautiful young girl. 
[03:22:00]  What do you mean?  He said, you notice how the people with kids have respect for her?  And I said, I have none.  I just can't.  I respect her parents.  Ro, you have a Ro mic.  If you're going to talk, talk into the Ro mic.  I think she's a role model for the kids.  Yeah, what's wrong with you today?  She's probably tired.  She's been babysitting a baby.  She's tired of this shit.  She has feelings for me.  I'll do their own impression.  She's hanging out with like a fucking, she'd rather be, if this would be exciting, if there  was some names in here. 
[03:22:30]  There is some names.  Maybe if you fucking got good publicity, you could have been a name when you came back.  You fucking premature shit dick.  You said you got bad publicity.  Publicity?  Publicity?  What's publicity?  I'm making fun of you, you dum-dum.  That's what you said.  We'd have to rewind that to hear that.  That was a pretty clever move that you just did.  Thanks.  Listen, Giannis.  Shit dick.  Did you just call me shit dick?  I did before, but that was in character.  This is Bobby talking about it.  Okay, Bob.  So you're out there, and you realize right away you're fucked. 
[03:23:00]  Right away I'm fucked.  But you still, you go forward with it.  You got to go.  You got a show that night?  The next night.  The next night.  So where will you stay?  It's me and Shane Moss who are roomating.  He's a comic.  Where?  We had a flat.  We had an apartment.  You call it a flat again.  I'm going to flatten your nose.  How's that?  I'm a fucking Madonna.  I'm translating the field.  We had an apartment.  We had an apartment.  So you...  Boston.  We had a fucking apartment.  We had an apartment.  So you have this...  Bobby. 
[03:23:30]  Fucking two of us were in a room together, kid.  And a festival.  Give off.  Fuck it.  God.  If I had a samurai sword, I'd slop one of your tits off right now.  You'd make me fucking violently angry with you.  Just your air coming through your tongue.  I would keep your tit and wear it as a hat.  Which one?  The right one?  The stretchable one, right?  Whichever one's bigger, yeah.  That's a disturbing thing to say.  What the fuck is that?  Wearing a hat is just not disturbing, but slicing it off with a samurai sword? 
[03:24:00]  Like, yeah, yeah.  Cut it off with a fucking sword.  He was trying to make my fucking atrocious thing funny, actually.  Making a tit hat would be cute.  I think I can throw it on my shoulder.  Here's the thing.  If I actually did cut a tit off in life right now in front of all you guys, you'd be all  in shock.  If he picked it up, we'd put it on the hat and went ba-da-ba-ba-ba-ba.  We'd all go, oh, all right.  We get it.  It's true.  I have to back Joe up on that.  Actually, you'll probably have to have a tit taken off anyways. 
[03:24:30]  Oh, my God.  Why?  Because my mom had breast cancer.  Oh, jeez.  I didn't know that.  You knew that?  We talked about that.  How did I know anything about her?  Don't fucking high-pitch Henry, everybody.  This podcast has no rules.  I don't know about your parents.  No bounds.  No rules.  God.  The YKWD has made us steal.  Hey, Kelly, you're probably going to get breast cancer.  Hey, Dad, son, your dad's dead.  Oh, boo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  You're fat, Rob.  Yeah.  Giannis, don't leave fucking Brooklyn. 
[03:25:00]  And your girlfriend, bye-bye.  Nobody has feelings here.  No, we do.  We all do.  We all care about each other.  We do.  All right.  So, Giannis, you want to die?  You get there?  What happened?  Yeah.  So, then, yeah, I knew it was going to be a problem.  Then the first show was for six people.  What did you do?  What were you doing?  You?  Just you?  Oh, my God.  Devin?  Devin?  That was the biggest laugh. 
[03:25:30]  He's fucking cracking up.  He can't stop laughing.  Devin draws more people from building websites.  People come out and watch him make websites.  Oh, shit.  Devin's dying.  Devin, you know.  I think we just figured out Devin's sense of humor.  So, you guys want to go do a show for three people?  Devin, it was only a ten-seater.  That was how he's saying.  That was good.  It's pretty good to the numbers.  Shit.  Considering that he headlines Carolines, that makes it even worse. 
[03:26:00]  Let's not call, when the curtain is drawn, it's not called headline.  I know it's not drawn.  I know you're going to say that.  I'm just glad that you know who I am.  That feels good.  I needed that.  Listen, we all know who you are.  You're a fucking funny guy, dude.  Not only are you as funny as yourself, you've built up a bunch of other,  outlets for yourself.  You're funny as a stand-up.  You're funny.  You have funny characters.  You do funny web things.  You're a creative person.  Oh, thanks, Bobby.  So, don't...  Edinburgh, just because nobody knows you outside of Brooklyn, or YouTube, listen to me. 
[03:26:30]  Devin is loving this shit.  Do they have YouTube in Scotland?  Yeah.  Dude, he can't take it.  It's called, it's called, yeah, tab.  Did you upload your videos to YouTube.sc?  You gotta go to that.  Yeah, that's what it is.  Then I have Latinos there.  So, I had to do a Scottish character before I get there.  So, you had six people in the crowd.  Six people, two of which were comedians.  But, by the way, in your head the whole time, you're going, at least I have my girlfriend  at home that loves me.  Right?  You fucking piece of shit.  Listen, man.  I hope your parents die again. 
[03:27:00]  What?  What the fuck?  I don't know.  There's no rules here, right?  Oh, we play with no rules?  Giannis just has a rule book out the window.  There's no rules.  Hope they fucking die again.  I want some rules just so Giannis can break them.  I love to...  He just...  Hope that your parents die twice.  Like they come back.  Like Harry Potter.  And then they die again.  Ah, well then his parents didn't really come back.  You know, Lewis would have went like this. 
[03:27:30]  I'm busy.  Mom, Dad, come back in an hour when I'm done with hammer fisting.  Holy shit.  Actually, Mom, Dad, can you watch James for a couple minutes while I go down the street  and do a spot at the fucking LOL?  Go fuck yourself.  Side note, Harry Potter's parents never came back.  They came back.  I know they didn't.  They came back in the fucking...  It was like fucking dreams and fantasies, dude.  That's what I meant.  My parents come back in my dreams and fantasies every day. 
[03:28:00]  First of all, the fact that you know...  Hi, Lewis.  We're not proud of you.  But my mom has my voice.  Lewis.  Your father comes back and goes,  It's because of you.  I knew it wasn't going to work out.  The guy wasn't even going to stab me.  I said, Please, no.  Stab me.  I hate my son.  I showed him a picture of you.  And he went, I got you, buddy.  Lewis, please stop doing that visor joke. 
[03:28:30]  Your joke shouldn't require an outfit.  You wear an outfit for a joke?  No, I have a joke that...  But I don't really do the part where I do it.  Is that a joke, though?  Ah, look at him defend himself.  Look at him.  He broke...  You saw that.  He got serious.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, it's on the road.  I'll do it.  You know, we can do it.  We'll do time on the road.  Lewis, he's acting like me.  The road is in Scarsdale, you idiot.  I would love to go to Scarsdale.  Oh, Jesus.  You know a Lewis bit? 
[03:29:00]  That's amazing.  I feel like Joe just sat on that one.  Fuck you, the house.  That's what Joe does.  So you're six people, two comics.  You go out, and I know what you're going to say.  Still a good show, right?  It was a good show.  Of course.  Of course it was.  No, I did a good show.  No, of course it was.  I did a good show.  Did you face blue?  You have to do that.  No.  That's a Braveheart reference.  Yeah.  We know.  Or a Blue Man Group reference, either way.  I was thinking a blue boy from Dragnet. 
[03:29:30]  That's where my mind went.  I was thinking you'd turn your mic off and go back home.  How's that?  Oh, Lewis pushed the mic away.  You guys have your boring conversation.  Ah, he cracked the shit.  Real ass dude.  So here's the deal.  Now, you're thinking in your head, tomorrow will be better.  They gave you the excuses.  Somebody gave you excuses.  You know, the Patriots are in town. 
[03:30:00]  Yeah.  It's hunting season.  They have the Antique Roadshow is right by here.  There's a lot of things going on in town.  Yeah.  So they give you excuses.  What happens the next night?  Next night, six people again.  Wow.  Yeah.  Look at fucking Devin laughing again.  Devin loves it.  Look, he's cracking up.  Look at him.  Why the fuck is that so funny to you?  It's so mean.  I've seen somebody do a show for six people and it is the saddest thing you've ever seen.  How many people could have fit? 
[03:30:30]  About 70.  Oh, shit.  That's not so bad.  I just won't invite him to your hotel room.  Yeah.  There's more.  There's more.  You just see empty seats like that.  It's an empty theater.  Can I just say something?  She's just fucking staring at empty seats.  When you pass more people on the way to the stage than are in front of you while you're  on stage, that's sad.  I remembered all their names.  I am crushing for Devin right now.  When do you know the names of your audience?  I was like, all right.  Thanks for coming out, Mike.  Bill, I appreciate it.  Sally, you were great.  At the same time. 
[03:31:00]  Liam.  Nice.  Good to see you, man.  Simultaneously, your manager was waiting on that many people.  Yeah.  This is going to be brutal.  Does nobody here want to work the stands?  Yeah.  That was the only line I said.  Oh, Jesus.  Now I'm going to be self-taught for the rest of the day.  Let me tell you something.  Your manager was so pissed, he took his apron off and he went right to the phone.  What?  I was going to send him some thank you macaroni and cheese, but now I'm not. 
[03:31:30]  I was on a whole fucking tray of truffle mac and cheese on my way to Edinburgh.  Yeah.  Edinburgh.  Ah, fuck me, dude.  All right.  So you make sure.  Now, what's the time difference?  You don't want to call during fucking supper rush.  Did you figure that out?  You guys got a produce show going on downstairs right now? 
[03:32:00]  Because I need to talk.  Hey.  Five hours.  Are you guys doing that lobster special tonight?  Because if not, I need to talk to you.  And how busy it gets when you do that special.  Do you guys have so many more famous at the club that you're taking 900 photos of and  they'll take my photo off and put up fucking Dane Cook's even though he fucking hates us  and we hate him?  Dane Cook was at the club.  Louis C.K. was your last name.  Yeah.  That's great. 
[03:32:30]  All right.  Jesus.  Look at Lou.  Lou moved from Dan to Louis C.K.  She really brought her expectations way down.  Why would you bang Louie?  No, I've been just, I've been dying to meet him.  Talking to the mic.  I don't think it's on.  I've been dying to meet him.  Is it on?  It's not on.  All right.  Switch mics with Kelly.  She just said she's been dying to meet him.  It's not going to get crazy.  I know.  You know, why am I turning anything on?  Let's make sure we hear what else is going to happen. 
[03:33:00]  Okay.  So, so now you go to the second night.  What happens the second night?  I just told you six people.  Third night.  Third night was the night where, that broke me.  First two nights, I was a fucking trooper.  You know?  Yeah.  I gave great shows for six people.  You were either a trooper or a mediocre comic.  Whatever you want to call it, I gave good shows.  People laughed.  Right.  The staff was laughing.  I was in good spirits.  I was like, all right, this is going to get better.  Right.  Tomorrow.  Were they laughing at your jokes or were they laughing like he was laughing at you?  Like Devin?  Yeah.  Were they Devin laughing? 
[03:33:30]  Just a reference to it makes him laugh.  Devin's about to hear what's going to happen on day three.  Day three.  Were they reading your fucking bio and they got to your representation?  Aren't those the guys who have those fucking, those epanamas?  Mean joke.  I'm going to be more quiet.  Oh, shit.  You want to call him up?  It's like, listen, I know it's happy hour over there, but it is not a happy hour over here.  Oh, by the way, the name of my show was called Happy Place.  Really? 
[03:34:00]  Was it?  That was the name of my show.  Wow.  I had a joke of me and Shane all week.  I was being, my show is now called Sad Place.  Is Shane there?  And then my, no, Shane.  But Michael Che was there too.  And he's fucking blowing up over there.  Is he really?  Yeah.  Why?  Because he's a, he's a great comic, man.  Yeah, but what the fuck is different?  Wait a minute, dude.  Stop.  I'm just being honest.  Okay, fine.  He's a very political answer.  No, it's not.  I've seen Michael Che.  I've seen it.  I've seen it.  He's good.  Okay, so what?  All right.  I'm just saying it.  You asked why and I said it. 
[03:34:30]  No, that's not it.  There's something else.  He had a great publicist.  Yeah.  There's something else.  Yeah.  He had a publicist.  Yeah.  He had the right publicist.  Then they paid for him to go there.  There's no way he fucking paid himself.  Because I think Michael Che.  There's no way he paid himself.  He had, he had it all done.  He had it, the way you're supposed to do it.  He did it.  He did it that way.  Yeah.  Festivals know who they want to promote and who they want to be their little babies.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They know, like Trevor Noah was a big one for a while.  And now, like Che, like, they know who they want to make stars.  And he hired the right PR.  He hired the right.  He didn't hire shit.  Who his people did. 
[03:35:00]  He didn't hire shit.  His people did.  Michael Che, I've read his tweets.  He's not doing anything but jokes.  That's all he's focusing on.  No, but his people hired the right publicist for him out there.  He had articles.  He had fucking radio spa.  He had one.  Well, he's also managed by the owners of Grace Papaya.  So they really have some.  Yeah, they have more time because, you know, that's just hot dogs.  You know what?  You guys are going to fire my fucking manager.  Do not fire your fucking.  Listen.  We've got too much going on.  Listen to me.  You need to have a meeting, but only at their restaurant. 
[03:35:30]  You can't go anywhere else.  Listen, NBC wants to come down.  I'm fired.  They want to meet you.  No, you're not.  No, you're not.  We're getting fired.  No, you're not.  Sunday nights are usually pretty dead.  Is it because of Kelly Pasuka?  No, don't say that on this show because then someone's going to ask me about it and I  don't want to have it.  I'm joking.  Kelly, I'm joking.  Kelly, first of all.  First of all, Kelly.  Hey, man.  Yeah, they're going to take her in the kitchen again like they did last time.  What's Bobby saying about us?  I don't know.  I just want to work here.  No, we love those guys. 
[03:36:00]  Those guys, look it.  Those guys are doing.  Why would I fire them?  They'd kick it.  I've gotten them so much.  You've gotten them.  Because of you, they've got great clients.  Why bring them this far just to leave them behind?  Why hand over thousands of dollars and then lose thousands of dollars for no reason?  Oh, my God.  Don't pay the bill.  That's so funny.  And the other stuff that's going on, do you have to pay them for that too?  What?  The other stuff that's going on with you? 
[03:36:30]  Yeah.  And my manager's, yeah.  You're not even going to live here?  Are you going to?  That's a fucking, yeah, what do you do?  That's how it works, right?  Yeah, not really.  I'm kidding.  No, of course you have to.  That fucking works.  I mean, if you're a fucking stupid idiot, you pay.  What the fuck is going on right now?  Why is this a little inside conversation?  Bobby's going to wait for it.  No, we're waiting for it.  Why?  Well, I mean, we'll get to it.  I want to get, we'll get to it right away.  And we're going to get to you, Devin.  Giannis is the new James Bond.  I have AIDS.  Listen.  If Giannis is meeting, beat you, Joe. 
[03:37:00]  Beat you.  First of all, Kelly, shut the fuck up.  I know you.  Stop acting like we don't know, that you already know what's going on, and you're going to  fucking spill the beans.  I don't.  Oh, I hate Kelly.  Also, you didn't beat me, you just yelled over me.  No, I said, because AIDS, you have herpes, I said, beat me.  Oh, beat me.  I think you meant beat me to the punchline.  Well, I started mine, you just yelled over me.  You know what?  Neither of you really win that one.  Yeah, and you know what, Joe?  Don't be so sensitive.  Yeah, you're so sensitive when it comes to that shit.  Jesus Christ.  He really is. 
[03:37:30]  I admit, I am very sensitive over when I'm talking, and then someone screams into their  microphone a half joke.  That was a good one.  AIDS!  I'm like, the thing about it is, AIDS!  And then I'm like this, that was kind of shitty.  You're very sensitive.  All right, well.  On that one, I say, touche, Joe.  Touche.  To Michael Che.  So anyways, so Michael Che's...  Imagine there were two Che's.  Michael Che's doing great out there.  He did it right.  They did it right. 
[03:38:00]  Not he.  There was Damien Lemon.  Michael Che just said yes.  They did it right.  He didn't fucking...  He didn't...  Can we just say or say...  You're right.  You're right.  He didn't fucking do anything.  You're right.  He went, okay.  They went, Mike, we're going to take care of everything.  You're going to do that.  Is that...  Okay.  Yeah.  And all you have to do is show up.  Okay.  Yep.  And he did his shit.  That's right.  All right.  You...  Right.  Because you're like us.  Look, most of us have to hustle.  Most of us have to make these mistakes.  Most of us have to figure shit out the hard way.  Yeah.  And then you have to watch people like Che fucking get butted through the business. 
[03:38:30]  You're right.  Not that he doesn't deserve it.  Not that...  I don't care about that.  That's how it goes.  Yeah.  Look, we always have...  Some people get it.  Some people don't.  We will always have those people.  Yeah.  You can't take anything away from him.  Yeah.  But you can't give anything to him either.  Right.  You can't say Michael Che made these...  He didn't.  He's just that guy right now.  Right.  He's a great guy.  He's a fucking hilarious guy.  Very creative.  But he's just the guy.  Right.  That they want to be the next guy.  Right.  They picked him.  Right.  They didn't pick you. 
[03:39:00]  Right.  Or me.  They're never going to pick Lewis.  Yeah.  But...  100% right.  100% right.  So here...  It has nothing to do with him or you.  100% right.  Okay.  You learned that you fucking...  You shouldn't have went there in the way you went.  Right.  Now here you are.  The shows are getting worse and worse and worse.  Third day was where I broke up.  And when you're calling at lunch break, when they take a second, are they...  I'm saying it's not going good.  What are they saying to you?  How are they helping you?  They say, trust the guy.  He's got a game plan.  He's calling people.  He's getting reviewers in.  Okay.  Now what happened?  He's got to hit the street. 
[03:39:30]  When did you know, I got to get the fuck out?  Okay.  So we were at day three.  You want to know what happens day three?  Day three.  Look at how fucking...  He's like, yeah, I want to know about day three.  We all do.  Day three.  We all want to know about day three.  So day three...  We have 12 people who have seen you so far in the country of Scotland.  That's correct.  Okay.  So day three...  Day three...  Yeah.  Oh, he's praying with the microphone.  Yeah.  They're like, we have no...  But he's going back to Vietnam.  We have no tickets sold.  It was about...  Oh my God.  So they're like, we're going to paper it.  We're going to give some free tickets.  We're going to help some people fire you. 
[03:40:00]  You turned into an improv on a Wednesday.  Yeah, it's the worst.  But the thing is, I will say, though, that's a common thing.  Lewis just left the room.  I overestimated it for...  That's a common thing, though, with Edinburgh, because there are so many shows, and you have  to...  A lot of great comics have to rely on their own flyering to help sell tickets during the  day.  So that's a common thing that will happen, and then until the reviewers come, that's  when things pick up.  I would have got a fan or something.  But that's what people say.  Can I say something, though?  That's the fucking pitch you hear.  Can I say something?  If I was going to go, I would have made a flyer, a poster, stickers. 
[03:40:30]  I would have spent around $500 on publicity, on things I could give out, and then I would  get a fan in Edinburgh of mine, and I would make them help me promote the show during the  day.  I'd spend all fucking day on the streets getting people to my show and having people from there  do it for me.  Did you do that?  Did you have flyers?  Did you have stickers?  Let's just get the beginning out.  Okay, go ahead.  This is how I knew at the beginning.  Let's go back a couple days. 
[03:41:00]  Let's go back.  How far are we going back?  To the first day.  They changed my...  Assembly changed my theater and my time right before I got there.  I don't know why.  I'll tell you why.  No tickets sold.  They needed that better theater for Michael Che.  Yeah, probably.  But they...  No.  The reason...  But the guide had you at a different place and time?  The guide had me at a different theater and a different time.  So that person was selling out at that theater.  And the theater that they moved me to was way off the beaten path at 8.15, which puts 
[03:41:30]  me in direct competition with all the big acts at 8.15, where my previous time was 11.15,  which obviously would have been better.  At night.  And I was in...  Not a.m.  And I was in a centrally located fucking theater right in the heart of it.  And they moved me.  And it was listed in the fucking book at the wrong time.  So people going to...  So I was dead in the water when I started.  Everyone fucked up.  Who fucked that up?  Assembly.  The people that brought me out.  Assembly fucked that up.  That's their fault.  And it's my management's fault and my agent's fault for saying yeah...  For trusting them and saying, yeah, it's a good idea to change it. 
[03:42:00]  Let's change it.  Why would they let you change it?  I don't know why they did it.  Why would they fucking change it?  I have no idea.  But that's exactly what happened.  But why wouldn't they ask you if it's okay?  I don't know.  Really?  Yeah.  Fuck, that's crazy.  And I probably would have said yeah, because what the fuck do I know?  I'm not paying attention.  You wouldn't have.  Maybe not, if I would have thought about it.  Well, hopefully if somebody asks...  Hopefully if your management says, hey, we're going to change it, you would have thought  about it.  Yeah.  You're not just going to go, yeah, what the fuck?  I would have been like, all right.  I didn't know it was listed in the book already at a different theater at a different time. 
[03:42:30]  So I was fucked at the beginning.  Okay.  So I'm fucked.  You're fucked.  And now I'm off the beaten path at 815 in direct competition with everybody.  Say beaten path again, I'm going to fucking beat you on the path downstairs.  So then third day comes, and there's no tickets sold, so they're about to call the show.  Yeah.  And so I'm broken.  My spirit's broken.  Because I'm burnt out.  Because I just did a week in Amsterdam.  Talk about broke.  Think about the theater.  Yeah.  Because of you.  Nobody has money over there.  Fucking stagehands are fucking having to get wrapped for lunch and dinner.  Take less to jump. 
[03:43:00]  They're going to have to, all the stagehands have to go to Michael Chase's show just to  get food in the back of the fucking green room.  Devin, take a breath.  Go ahead.  This is his favorite moment ever.  So you're done.  So you're done.  So it's fucking dead, and so they tell me they're canceling it, so I'm in my mind.  I'm broken.  I'm going.  And then they go, oh no, 10 people just walked in.  Yeah.  And you're looking.  It's all the management and waiters from the stand.  They just pulled.  And they have cake.  They have cupcakes and eponomas.  Hey, we're here. 
[03:43:30]  We're saving the show.  We brought all our new talents.  Hey.  They just pulled 10 people off the street, and they had the shittiest energy because over  there, like, free tickets is like, they walked into an empty theater, and they're probably  like, oh, this place is empty because we're about to see some horrible shit.  Right.  So their energy was shitty.  Right.  Yeah.  Well, and then, you know, I have to admit, I didn't have the spirit to fucking win this  over.  I just was defeated.  So I just sat there and fucking pulled the stool up, and we went through an hour. 
[03:44:00]  You did a Patrice?  Yeah.  You sat on a fucking stool.  Yeah.  I was defeated.  Well, no.  He was a vessel for Patrice.  Oh, the guy stealing Patrice's shit.  You take your boots off?  You put your feet on the table?  Oh, wow.  Oh, boy.  That would have missed.  I don't think he...  I don't...  You know why?  You don't get the bomb for that?  He's got a good batting average.  I don't think...  He's got a great batting average.  I don't think that was a bomb.  I shouldn't get the bandana because you fucking assholes should know a casino reference when  you hear it.  That's not all of you fucking douchebags. 
[03:44:30]  It doesn't make people laugh.  It's still a bomb.  I don't care if it's good in your head.  I know, but it's your problem.  You guys should know a casino better.  And it wasn't an original joke.  It was a reference.  I don't think it was a bomb for a reference.  Oh, boy.  Well, you guys should all fucking rent a casino.  Somebody's a blind Joe List fan at this point.  No, it's good.  I'm so excited.  Even though it didn't work, I understood the format.  You're all jerks.  All right.  Listen.  The lobby's all over it.  Every joke has to come from a certain place.  I apologize for the reference to a movie that I thought you guys would have seen.  You joke bombed.  Back to the low point of your life and the biggest show ever. 
[03:45:00]  If you go on fucking Jay Moore's podcast, you want to do references of movies.  So, all right.  What a fucking raging bull.  We got who?  We're fucking geniuses.  I apologize.  All right?  I apologize.  I know every word.  So, everything's on the line.  You're bombing.  Back to you, shit dick.  Okay.  So, you're on the stage.  You're after the stool.  She's on the stage.  Sitting on a stool.  So, it just went through an hour.  And then what happened?  Did they applaud?  No.  Well, I made them laugh by saying, you know, we can turn this into the most insignificant 
[03:45:30]  moment in history to one of the most infamous moments in history if we all committed mass  suicide.  Right.  And that became like a really fun theme.  Right.  I was saying, like, it would be great.  They'd have a moment of silence at the festival for us.  Right.  It would take a couple days for people to do it.  No, they already had the moment of silence at your show.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's called the Giannis moment.  Can I at least have my fucking moment here?  I'm already dying for an hour.  You're right.  You're right.  Ten free tickets. 
[03:46:00]  Don't be sensitive.  They called...  You know what?  That's a good one.  Joey's back.  Now, when people go to the festival, they call, dude, don't get Giannis.  Make sure you do it right.  You don't want to be Giannis.  Don't do it, Giannis.  Are you pulled a poppus?  Just hired anybody to do your PR?  That's fucking hilarious.  It probably will be that.  Yo, your publicist is poppus, man.  What do you mean?  You know, dude.  That's just a joke.  That's fucking funny. 
[03:46:30]  Don't Giannis it if you go.  Don't Giannis it.  So you do the show.  Now, what happens?  Everybody's hearing about this.  People must be hearing about it.  No, seriously.  Bad stuff travels, too.  Why don't you just bring him here to fucking laugh at this shit?  I met this guy 18 minutes ago.  I don't fucking know who he is.  But I love it.  There's literally nothing funnier than a broken comedian.  Devin is great.  You would love this show.  Even though he looks like he used to do fishing tours in fucking Tampa. 
[03:47:00]  He does have a Tampa look.  He does.  So then, when do you...  You go back to your room that night, and you're what?  You're calling your management.  Yeah, I'm yelling.  You're yelling at Chris and who?  Yeah, Chris and Dave.  Yeah, and they're trying to calm you the fuck down.  Yeah, it's going to go good.  You get to hustle.  We knew this going in.  So they're lying to you.  Calvin's got the stuff on the way.  They're fucking lying.  The wolf's on the way, you know?  They're lying.  Yeah, the wolf's on the way.  They're trying to fucking get you calmed down.  No movie references, please.  He's angry.  Fucking good. 
[03:47:30]  Joe's fucking good.  He's the fucking truth.  So now they're trying to help you.  Yeah, yeah.  They're trying to calm you down.  They're trying to calm you down.  Because, look, it is what it is.  Yes, and who makes the decision, I'm fucking out of here?  Me.  Why?  Because I'm not a fucking idiot.  And I'm, you know?  I knew it was time to cut the losses and not try to sink more money into this.  I knew I was dead in the water.  I got a sense.  I got an instinct for the whole thing as soon as I got there.  How do you?  How do you?  Glenn Wool, my buddy Glenn Wool, who's big out there.  Right. 
[03:48:00]  He's been there eight, nine times, whatever.  Right.  We had a conversation, like, the second night.  We were hanging out.  And he was telling me how he did it.  And I was telling him how I'm doing it.  And he was like, he just was like, whoa.  Yeah.  He was basically letting me know everything is wrong.  And what did he say?  Did he tell you his lead?  If you go out there and nobody's bringing you out, you want to go out there.  You don't go out there like that.  You go out there, do the free fringe, do some spots, get a feel for it.  Right.  You know, try to get some buzz going, get some fans, hand out some cards.  Yeah.  You know, you get a feel for it. 
[03:48:30]  Then you come back again.  Maybe the third year you go for it.  You put all your money into a flyer team.  Can I just say, it sounds like a fucking pain in the ass.  It's a, you want to know what I really think about this?  It's a dumb festival.  It's a dumb, dude, they have a free fringe.  So they have a free fringe that competes with the fringe.  Imagine at Montreal, they had a free Montreal festival.  So you could go see the same comedians doing like 15 minutes.  And then they fucking cannibalize their own audience.  It sounds like a fucking, look at a fucking pain in the ass. 
[03:49:00]  You're walking around, there's some dude doing a, some deaf guy doing a Chaucer play,  one man show, handing out fucking flyers.  You can't walk down the street without being accosted by people trying to hand out flyers  for their dumb dream.  That place needs a dream police.  The only time I like that is when there's fucking titties on those flyers.  And the Mexicans snapping it, scaring the fuck out of you.  Snap, snap, buzzy, buzzy.  The place needs a dream police, man, where people go around and be like, nope,  and they just scoop people off the street and say no.  They just let anybody in.  It's a bloated, oversaturated, dream Ponzi scheme. 
[03:49:30]  Now, a few people benefit, everybody else is just funding that fucking whale.  That's like a microcosm of the entire business.  Yeah, pretty much.  That's funny, I literally just didn't think of the exact same thing.  It's like the New York comedy scene that you could describe it the exact same way.  Yeah, it's like, it's brutal.  So you say to...  Sad, Giannis.  So you call up...  If you're going to go to Edinburgh, go produce.  You have to be produced by somebody.  You have to be produced, and then you're fine.  Like Michael Che did.  Michael Che or somebody, other people I know, yeah.  So now, you call your management. 
[03:50:00]  Are they with you?  Are they cool with it?  They're saying...  Dave wanted to make it work, man.  He was fighting.  He's like, I'm a fighter.  He's trying to make it work.  Did you call them, or did you see him on the web?  I was calling them every fucking day, saying that this isn't good.  Right, every day.  Every day.  And then, now, who flies you back?  You?  Yeah.  So you had to take the hit on the ticket?  Take the hit on the ticket.  You had to fucking transfer it to earlier?  Yeah, I hired a flyer distributor.  Were the flight attendants laughing like Devin when you boarded the plane?  He's not supposed to be here for 17 more days. 
[03:50:30]  Every single person said I was doing the right thing.  Every single comic I spoke to.  Especially the guy who was going to get you a theater after you left.  The mime that was going to fill it.  Everyone said...  This next one is I draw your eyeballs on my chin, and I hang upside down.  And I do a whole show like that.  Sold out!  Nobody told me it was the wrong move.  Yeah.  I haven't heard it was the wrong move. 
[03:51:00]  So you come back, and here you are.  Yeah.  I cut my losses and lost money, but I could have lost a lot more money.  And then you come back, and you've got to make an immediate decision on something else.  I've got to make an immediate decision.  Can you talk about that?  Not really.  Not really.  What is this?  What is going on?  We're not going to talk about it.  I can't, because it's not...  He's got...  He has an opportunity that isn't fucking in stone.  Right.  But Giannis is...  Giannis is...  Playing Billy the Kid in Young Guns 3.  He's got some good stuff going on. 
[03:51:30]  That's all.  Good.  Look, I always say this.  You know, with this bad, tragic shit that we go through, and we've all been through it.  Honest to God.  We've all been through it.  You come out the...  There's some guys that have to fucking go through the mud.  There's some guys that never get touched at all.  They just go right up, and they float the fuck to where they're going to be in 10 years,  and they just hover there.  Dan Soder!  No, Dan Soder's...  But eventually they get it.  Dan Soder had to grind.  Dan Soder smelled like guacamole the first year on the show. 
[03:52:00]  And eventually everyone gets it, even if...  Just because it takes you way longer than everybody in your class.  Even the guys that have that right, eventually they're getting it somewhere.  They're fucking taking a hit.  They'll get it.  It's coming, yeah.  People said that about Dane, and then it became cool to fucking hate Dane,  which is not anything we will experience.  Right.  Well, yeah.  Everybody does get it at some point. 
[03:52:30]  You will go through your tragedy.  It's just at a different level.  You know, Dave Chappelle did it.  I mean, you know, look, we all get it.  Colin was on Tough Crowd, and oh my God, he probably...  And then it went away.  That's the one thing you can be guaranteed in this business.  You will be fired from the job that you love at some point.  You will not keep that for 20 years unless you're on Law & Order.  All right?  You will be fired, and you'll have to get another job.  If it's TV or movies or whatever the fuck, radio, at some point you will be fired. 
[03:53:00]  You're planning on firing Kelly soon or a little ways away?  If fucking Ro wasn't abandoning me, I would have been next week.  Oof.  It's all right.  I'm kidding, Kelly.  Mine was a little quip.  Yours is quite hurtful.  Yeah, I know.  Those are my rules.  I'm telling you, there's no fucking rules on this thing.  That's why I...  I'm getting fired talking about my mom's breast cancer.  That sounds great.  Well, I didn't talk about your mom's breast cancer.  Tell me your hopeful breast cancer.  You didn't talk about your mom's breast cancer.  I did.  Your hopeful breast cancer.  This is no...  And no rules.  This fucking episode has no rules.
