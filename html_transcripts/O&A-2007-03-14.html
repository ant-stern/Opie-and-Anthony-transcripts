<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with comedic chaos, apparently stemming from a pre-show fart incident.  The hosts, Opie, Anthony, and James Norton, immediately expressed their dissatisfaction with their show's outdated intro, featuring a repeated American Idol audition promo, ordering a staff member to fix it.  The main topic then shifted to Sanjaya Malakar's surprising popularity on American Idol.  Patrice O'Neal called in, adding humorous commentary about Sanjaya's striking appearance and the judges' reluctance to criticize his poor singing, using several homophobic slurs in the process.  This segment involved much laughter and crude jokes about Sanjaya's effect on straight men.

The conversation took a serious turn with a discussion of the brutal mugging of a 101-year-old woman.  The hosts expressed outrage, highlighting the lack of progress in the investigation and offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to the assailant's arrest. They read and reacted to angry letters to the editor, some advocating violence against the mugger, culminating in a humorous, yet graphic, imaginary boxing match between an 80-year-old columnist and the mugger.  The hosts also promoted upcoming events, including their "Walkover" event and their "Traveling Virus Comedy Tour" in Las Vegas, featuring Joe Rogan, Louis C.K., and other comedians.  The discussion returned to the mugging and a proposed new law making assaulting the elderly a felony, further emphasizing public and media outrage.

The show briefly announced a St. Patrick's Day event at a host's brother's restaurant before moving to a highly emotional discussion about Jessica Lunsford's murderer and the defense's use of brain scans to mitigate the sentence.  The hosts advocated for brutal forms of capital punishment, graphically describing various methods.  A male caller, Jimmy, recounted a post-coital conversation with his girlfriend about weight gain, sparking a discussion about their volatile relationship.  This was followed by a "MacBook Karaoke" segment featuring Pamela, a previous winner, singing "Like a Virgin."  Before her performance, the hosts and guest Doug Stanhope discussed scandalous pictures of Pamela found online, which she attributed to a party.  Further discussion ensued about a conflict between American Idol judges Ryan Seacrest and Simon Cowell, including speculation about Seacrest's sexuality, and a past phone prank.  Bill Burr's upcoming stand-up shows and the Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus Comedy Tour were also promoted.

Pamela Hartman then performed a disastrous rendition of "Like a Virgin," with her MySpace account number shared on air.  The hosts discussed the performance with callers, expressing varying degrees of disgust and amusement.  Doug Stanhope, present in the studio, appeared bewildered.  A significant portion involved Lisa from Florida recounting an explicit sexual encounter with Doug Stanhope ten years prior.  The discussion expanded to Lisa's personal life, including her being a widow with five children, and her current relationship status.  The conversation also touched upon listeners' reactions to Pamela's singing, 9/11 and moon landing conspiracy theories, unpleasant experiences with substances applied to genitals, and a detailed, graphic discussion about vasectomies, including a previous Opie and Anthony stunt.

The show featured a caller describing a gruesome testicle injury, prompting a discussion about graphic bodily fluids.  Pamela, a female caller, was then subjected to listeners' often insulting and sexually suggestive comments about her singing of a Spice Girls song.  Her singing was played, described as bad, and the hosts attempted to elicit a wilder side from her, without success.  Other callers shared unusual stories, including one about bug spray causing penile shrinkage.  The segment concluded with a call from Jeff Goldblum, referencing a memorable line from his early career and discussing his career and celebrity impressions.  The hosts once again plugged their upcoming comedy tour.

Jeff Goldblumâ€™s call covered his career, working with actors like Willem Dafoe, Angelica Huston, and Bill Murray, and a negative experience with an unnamed actor. He also discussed his new detective show and experiences with stalkers.  The show then returned to listener calls, many sexually explicit, featuring boasts about large breasts and a graphic account by Doug Stanhope of a fisting encounter.  Calls about a home invasion and sexual assault also prompted strong reactions.  A call from Butters, an effeminate young man, led to a lengthy, sexually suggestive conversation with the hosts and a caller named Token Gay, focusing on Butters' sexuality and MySpace page.  The show ended with announcements, more listener calls, promotion of sponsors including Bodog Fights, a mention of "Whip Em Out Wednesday," and an explanation of the WOW campaign.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  As daylight breaks, creeping through the shadows, an unstoppable force lays in wait, ready to strike.  Oh my god!  Oh Jesus, Jimmy!  I get scared.  I think I'm scared.  Oh god!  Holy mother of god! 
[00:00:30]  Oh boy, please don't!  God damn it!  What?  What?  Oh, it stinks so bad!  Oh my god!  This is killing me!  You're killing me!  Uh oh, just fart so we can start the bit.  Oh my god!  I got to show you the Tatterton!  Just god damn it!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Ah!  I'll die! 
[00:01:00]  No!  Kofi.  I'm stumped because I'm a shapely European blonde.  Anthony.  Jesus, we are just whores.  James Norton.  Look at this face.  How do you not love it and want to kiss it?  You rock.  Sex Bagel here on the radio with you.  Sex Bagel.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  And Sex Bagel gets hit with poker chips.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  You do realize that's what they hear when the alarm goes off.  This?  No.  All that.  All that garbage.  Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.  Yeah. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah, we gotta soften the intro.  We hate the intro.  Yeah, we have a hard time with the intros.  I would like an intro to this show that kind of changes on a, on like a daily basis.  Yeah.  Just subtle changes to the intro to keep it interesting.  You know what I heard that, like, really bugged me?  There was a, a promo for the show being played that I heard a couple of times.  And it was us talking about American Idol. 
[00:02:30]  But it was from the auditions, like the original auditions, week one.  On this station?  In New York City?  Yeah, I do believe it was during that period.  It was us talking about, remember the, the, uh, uh, guy that was in the military and had  the horseshoe bald head?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was the break.  I don't even remember the guy anymore.  I don't either.  I was like, why is this being played as a promo?  You couldn't find anything else that we could have used in the past three months? 
[00:03:00]  Boy, if that's not telling.  Oh.  They can't find anything else.  They gotta play an old American Idol break.  Like, I can think of 50 things that you could just throw in there aside from that.  How recent was that?  This past weekend.  No.  I swear.  Uh, someone's not doing their job.  I'm not kidding.  It bugged me.  And, and it was being played over and over again.  Uh, E-Rock, make a note. 
[00:03:30]  Try to find out what that's all about.  Update these things for the love of God.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opian Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spread.  Give me that.  Oh, yell at Kenny.  Thank you.  Oh, I'm being yelled at.  I just needed my coffee.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  Speaking of Idol, did you watch last night a little bit?  Uh, a little bit, a little bit.  Saw some clips.  Can we get Patrice on the phone?  Eek.  I saw the first hour and then went to, to bed nice and early last night. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  Woke up at 4.30.  I was just telling you guys, drooling.  Just drooling on my, uh, pillow.  How'd that work out for you?  Well, Tylenol, Tylenol PM.  Oh, boy.  Why is this stuff legal?  Now, did you take it because you had a headache, a cold, or just to help you go to sleep?  No, no, no.  Because the last one there could be a problem.  No, no, no, no.  I always find some kind of excuse why I need the aspirin.  Yeah. 
[00:04:30]  I needed the Vicodin.  You know, I'm feeling a little achy because I've been working extra hard at the gym.  Eh, maybe I'll take a Tylenol.  You know what?  I'm going to take a Tylenol PM because I haven't been sleeping right the last few days.  It's afternoon, so it is PM.  So I'm just taking it as per the time of day.  But I'm smart.  I took one.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  I took one while I was watching American Idol.  Next thing I know, I'm staring at the TV.  I don't know what I'm watching anymore.  Next thing you know, you don't know. 
[00:05:00]  And then I just go to bed, and I never sleep the whole night.  I did.  And you ever wake up in the exact same position that you laid your head down in?  Yeah.  You just didn't move at all.  But you just know, like, all right, I'm just going to start sleeping this way.  And, you know, as the night's going on, you're rolling around, falling off to bed.  Your head is where your toes used to be.  All sorts of crap's going on.  But this morning, I wake up, and I'm like, wait a minute.  This is how I laid down, like, seven, eight hours ago.  Yeah.  And then there's drool coming out of my mouth.  I'm like, I guess I slept well last night. 
[00:05:30]  You're in a coma.  Oh, absolutely.  Hey, we woke up Patrice O'Neal.  So let's get him on the line right away here.  Patrice.  Yeah, what's up, man?  Hey, man.  Sleepy, Patrice.  Sorry we had to wake you up, but I called Patrice last night.  I was watching American Idol.  And for the most part, to talk about American Idol is kind of boring.  We all know that.  Yeah, nothing going on there.  But Patrice started something when he was filling in for Jimmy last week,  where he walked into our office really, really, really bothered.  And he wants the healing to begin, meaning he wants Sanjay. 
[00:06:00]  Sanjay.  Sanjay.  It's Sanjaya, fellas.  Sanjaya.  Please respect her name.  Yeah, Sanjaya.  But Patrice walks in, and he's just like, he's got to get kicked off the show.  The healing's got to begin.  You want to explain again?  Because Jimmy hasn't heard what that was all about.  He's in studio, obviously.  Oh, you haven't.  He's this kid.  It's this Indian kid who is the most beautiful person I've ever seen.  Last night, Diana Ross was impressed. 
[00:06:30]  He's like a young Michael Jackson with no talent, but the same cosmic charm that no one can,  you can't get him out your skull.  And last night, I had to find out.  You know how to ask them questions?  I'm going to write in, what hair products do you use?  Because I almost punched my girl in the face for her hair not being as pretty as his last night.  If you're not watching Idol every week, Sanjaya has a new hairstyle every week. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  His natural hair is kind of wavy and long.  And then one week, he blew it out and threw some highlights in it.  And it was nice and straight.  Last night, he gets on that stage with this crazy kind of like loose perm.  He looked like a pretty young black woman.  No, it was better than that.  It was like Shirley Temple in her prime years.  They were big. 
[00:07:30]  I don't even know if they make things where you can make the curls.  And he sings, ain't no mountain high.  And I was just singing along, and I said, you know it ain't, baby.  But Patrice is disturbed by the feelings he's getting by watching Sanjaya on American Idol.  He's just gorgeous.  He's just gorgeous.  Gorgeous.  And I told you, it's not even, if you took him out and said that this was your boyfriend, you wouldn't be gay. 
[00:08:00]  Your friends would all just be, oh, well, nice to meet you.  You can argue with him and everything.  He'd be like, look, you don't tell me I look pretty like you used to.  I'd be like, look, Sanjaya, look.  But, you know, I'm trying to do better.  So I'm watching last night.  As soon as he walked down that stage, I just called Patrice immediately and just started laughing.  I'm like, dude, I might be with you finally.  I might be there.  Isn't it?  And he's not lying.  He called me last night. 
[00:08:30]  I'm looking at my phone.  It's just obvious.  What's going on?  But it's right with Sanjaya.  So I said, he must be under the spell.  Under the spell.  Under the spell.  Bobby Kelly Tebow's, just Sanjaya's performance.  And then I get an email, like you started something, because I get an email from Eric Logan, you know, our boss over at XM.  And he writes, Sanjaya on Idol is freaking me out.  Patrice is right.  Please break my heart. 
[00:09:00]  What a fag.  He had two earrings.  He had two earrings, dude.  Yeah.  And here's the thing.  Here's how magical he is.  Here's how magical he is.  The judges have given up on trying to destroy him.  Yeah.  After he sings so badly.  You know, like Simon is still trying to keep his composure and say he's awful.  But the other two just go, oh, you know, your hair is beautiful. 
[00:09:30]  They don't even say you suck anymore.  Yeah.  They just go, what are you going to do?  And he's not going to get voted off this week, because the good-looking white girl who sang the other song poorly, she'll get voted off before him.  He's like the new, remember the kid last year that looked like Harry Potter that just would not get kicked off?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That little, Kevin, the kid with the lisp.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:10:00]  It's something about, I'm telling you, he has, it's going to be middle-aged rednecks who are going to vote for some time.  Middle-aged rednecked men, straight men are going to vote for some time.  He's so innocent up there, too.  He has no clue that he is just god-awful.  He has no clue that he can't sing, and it's a singing competition.  But I think he does have a clue.  I think he realizes his strength is to try to look as pretty as possible every weekend, and then people will continue voting for him. 
[00:10:30]  Look at his hair.  I love that the judges are commenting on him like, he's a girl now.  Yeah.  Like, well, you look lovely this evening.  Yeah.  No interest.  They don't even like, like, he said something, Sammy goes, look, man, if you hear something that sounds like wailing in California, that's Diana Ross.  He's listening to you sing her song, ain't no mountain high enough.  And he goes, what do you mean?  And how could half of the country, I started the whole country along with me goes, oh, Simon, that was just me. 
[00:11:00]  Aw.  Yeah.  Aw.  I usually like when Simon, like, you know, trashes the contestants, but is he gay or is he just effeminate?  We don't know.  No, he's not naughty.  He's not.  It's like I said, he's such an effeminate person that, like I said, if you said, this is my boyfriend, no one would go, you're gay.  People would go, hey, how are you? 
[00:11:30]  She's beautiful.  He's like this mutated, cross-breeded Indian with everything exotic.  You know what I mean?  He's just an exotic, beautiful, perfect hair, right?  He's more big eyes.  He's gorgeous.  There's gorgeous mouth.  The only thing he's missing is hips.  Like a woman, he was cursed with hips, without hips.  He was cursed with an appendage.  Other than that, he's just a girl, Norton.  He's not gay. 
[00:12:00]  It's not like.  Yeah, all girl.  He's prettier and more feminine than most women out there.  Right.  He's not.  He's not a flamboyant sissy.  He's a, he's a, he's a, he's a fender loin.  He's just, he's androgynous perfection.  But Patrice, you got in my head last night, so I had to call you.  I told you, man.  Yeah.  Because he, you're not lying.  You sure didn't call me.  Wait, wait.  I had the Simon clip that you were talking about.  Here it is.  I need to go back. 
[00:12:30]  He can't.  Look.  When you hear a whale in Beverly Hills, that is where Dinah Ross is watching this show.  What?  What?  She's got a freak when she hears that.  The only similarity is the hairstyle.  I, I, I, I don't know what else to say.  I mean, it, it was.  Look, okay, so I'll be positive.  Um, how old are you? 
[00:13:00]  Huh?  How old are you?  17.  Right.  You're very brave.  I'll give you that.  You're brave.  She's very brave.  The crowd is turning on Simon because they, they like this kid.  Everyone likes this kid, even though he can't sing.  Yeah.  Did you hear me go off?  Yeah.  Oh.  That was Patrice from, uh, Jersey City.  And, and then Simon has to explain what he meant because Sanjay is just so innocent.  He didn't understand that was a trash.  Of course not.  We're dying to know what's going on in your head when you're listening to them give you 
[00:13:30]  feedback tonight.  I, I, I don't even know.  I mean.  Well, no, I was into the positive things, but sometimes, uh, no offense, Simon, but your  first comment, I had no idea what you're talking about.  Okay.  I, I, I.  What I was trying to say was, when, when she listens to this on TV, she'll scream.  Okay.  He wasn't talking about the marine biology aspect of sea life. 
[00:14:00]  It's more of an, an audible sound from, okay.  By the way, he kind of sounds like Michael Jackson a bit, huh?  He's got some.  He's purely Michael Jackson.  And let me tell you something.  What's the, what's the, the, the guy, the host?  Uh, Ryan Seacrest.  Seacrest, right?  He's, he's joining in with the meanness because he feels the pressure of Sanjay.  The pressure.  He's trying to get mean.  You know how you get mean?  Like, get out of my face, Sanjay.  But he's, he's haunting everyone who's straight. 
[00:14:30]  And there's been rumors about Ryan Seacrest.  Uh, yeah.  He's panicking up there.  Like, oh God.  Are they looking at my eyes a little closely here?  Are they looking at my mannerisms?  Oh God.  Ryan Seacrest is trying not to gulp.  He's like, he's just trying to like, just play it straight.  So excited.  Right.  Are you saying this, this kid's the type of guy that you would just be happy to, just to  watch a movie under an Afghan with?  He really, he really is romantic looking. 
[00:15:00]  Romantic.  You know, everyone forgot, but Sanjay's sister, like, auditioned for Idol.  Yep.  Oh God, I would love to see her in all her different hairstyles.  Now that you get to see, uh, Sanjay.  Yeah, they both went up there and auditioned, uh, together.  And Sanjay just made it, uh, a little further.  All right.  Ant, you didn't, you didn't see him?  Did you see him yet?  Well, he's...  Oh, of course.  I saw his little perm.  There's pictures of him, but I can't, I don't have any, there's no video of you.  Oh, where, pull up the video, Iraq, of him doing the hula dance. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, the hula dance.  For, uh, Jimmy.  Do you think, do you think girls like him?  Oh, yeah.  They're in love with the kid.  Yeah, young girls.  Young girls that have no clue that, uh, about, about the gay.  They just think he's adorable.  Yeah, they don't know anything about sexuality.  And then we got Paula Abdul.  This is worth playing.  Uh, Paula usually has something nice to say about every contestant, no matter what.  This is the best she could do with Sanjay last night after that horrendous, uh, singing performance.  Sanjay, I can understand why Diana said you're pure love.  Because you are, you are the sweetest soul. 
[00:16:00]  You smile and it, it warms people's hearts.  It really does.  I mean, it, it wasn't that you sang on pitch.  It's, I understand what Diana was saying.  You have to start it off where you really got to grab the audience.  And when a song like that happens, you got to just let go.  And I think that's the thing I'm trying to say.  You got to explode with your, with your vocals now.  You got to really jump out, reckless abandon and go.  You look adorable.  Your hair is popping though.  Your hair is popping though.  Your hair is popping. 
[00:16:30]  They just, they just stopped saying he's a bad singer.  And you know, Patricia's right.  He will not be voted off tonight.  Again.  No, no.  No way.  See, the top 10 get to, um, tour the country.  He's going to be one of the top 10.  Yeah.  They're going to make sure he's one of the top 10 because he's, he's a draw.  There's websites dedicated to this kid.  America's going nuts with this kid, even though he can't sing.  Oh, you're right.  You're right, Obi.  It's like, he's not, I'm telling you, he's not going anywhere.  It's like me, my girl, she voted.  Like we don't even vote. 
[00:17:00]  Text, we text on giant.  He's going to win.  There's no way he's getting off.  Well, he'll, he'll get voted off eventually, but, uh, he's got at least another week or  two in him.  Hey, here's what Randy had to say that finally, and then we'll move on.  But here's, uh, from last night's American Idol.  So, Jairo, what's going down, dude?  What is really going down, dog?  Um, yo, man.  Wow.  Um, I, I, I am really, I, dude, I don't even know what to say, man.  I'm like. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, I think he, I think Randy's got the bug.  Um, I think Randy's got the bug.  Randy's speechless.  You see how everyone's voices change?  They're like, holy crap, he's hot.  He's speechless.  And, and, and, and don't forget what he's saying, though.  He's saying, you know, ain't no mountain high, you know, with that little, uh, no voice,  there's no power at all.  Yeah.  And that's, it's hypnotic.  But you can hear it in Randy's voice.  He's like, oh, man, this guy's giving me feelings I didn't know I had. 
[00:18:00]  Randy wants to rape this kid like Max Cady.  Right.  Back to Randy.  Dude, I don't even know what to say, man.  I'm like.  Dude, it wasn't very good.  It really wasn't, man.  It really wasn't.  You know, listen, thank God for the background singers, because that song was almost unlistenable  for me, man.  It was really, really weak.  But you know what I love about you?  You know what I look forward to, man? 
[00:18:30]  Every week, dude, you throwing down some different dudes with the hair, man.  The hair is rocking, though.  Dude, hair idol, you gotta jump it off, man.  I'm saying, you know what I mean?  Wow.  They're just all complimenting.  Because this is a singing competition.  Over 30 million people a week are watching.  This kid has no business being in it.  But America loves him.  They keep voting for him.  And no business is the right word.  Like, he should be removed, but he just won't be. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  All right.  God, man.  Well, we had to start the show by calling you, Patrice.  That's all right, man.  Glad you called, dude.  Yeah, because I was watching last night, and all I was thinking was Patrice must be losing  his mind with his new hair, dude.  This little curly hair.  And usually, Norton, usually he has some, it's like a straight, flowing thing, like  a mix.  But last night was full-on big roller curls.  Big roller curls.  Yeah, the big loose curls.  It was blown and set.  I call a hairstylist to see what that was. 
[00:19:30]  It was a blown set.  All right, Patrice.  All right, man.  Go to bed.  See y'all, man.  There's Patrice O'Neal, everyone.  It was funny.  He's just taken with him.  I was just watching the kids hula dance.  Oh, yeah.  You saw his little hula dance?  Do you have audio of him singing?  I never heard him sing.  Yeah, we should get the Ain't No Mountain High enough.  Yeah, because you know why there's no audio of him singing?  That's the least important part of what he does on that stage. 
[00:20:00]  He hypnotizes people with his big, dull eyes.  And everyone's voice changes.  You heard Randy like, oh, hello.  I'm questioning my own sexuality.  What do I do, dog?  Keep under control.  Don't let him see you sweat.  All right, we got to take a break.  We're just getting rolling here.  We got the latest news on the old bra that was mugged.  Won't get out of the news.  Yeah, we'll talk about that next.  And there's a columnist here in New York. 
[00:20:30]  Oh, really mad?  Oh, he's mad.  He's mad as hell.  And he wants to take on the mugger.  And he's got moxie.  He's got the moxie.  All right.  Oh, no.

[00:30:00]  which guy if you if you catch him oh that'd be bring him down here yeah because we're gonna take  him on because everyone else wants that yeah you know what's funny about that there's letters to  the editor there's there's bill gallo column i want to read real fast it's like three paragraphs  let's be honest here man that guy and he's a creep for what he did obviously but if he really  wanted to he would have knocked her head right off her body you think he gave her old lady punches  like he just kind of lightened up on her a little yeah which doesn't make it any any better obviously 
[00:30:30]  but he was just kind of toying with her that wasn't like that guy was an animal that wasn't the kind of  punch he would give somebody for giving him like some soap chip instead of some crack then he would  have walked up and like knock that guy's head off still punch her in the face it's an old lady punch  yeah but she looks like jimmy stewart how do you punch her jimmy stewart  anyway but you got this column i'm gonna read bill gallo and and others if you saw this guy face 
[00:31:00]  to face you would crap yourself face to face you look away lock your doors but it's pretty much what  we were talking about yesterday everyone likes hiding behind their computers with fake names and  fake screen names and stuff but the reality is if you're face to face with these people you're  trashing on the computer you would crap yourself yep you absolutely would bill gallo in uh the daily  news today he's he's a legend he's a legend he's been writing for who knows probably is huh 10 years  could be i would guess i would guess he's been writing for 65 years he's in his 80s is he in his 80s 
[00:31:30]  he's in his 80s uh the headline like picking on old ladies punk punk want a piece of me  oh look i dry gristly piece of me look we're all pissed off and all and you know and bill gallo's  a terrific columnist but stop stop you got you got to know your limitations stop and then it gets  it's embarrassing this article is embarrassing to read you know this lowlife who has been mugging 
[00:32:00]  helpless old women whoever you are punk i'd like to meet you in any boxing ring and see if you're  interested in a fist fight fisticuffs first of all if you're really brave you should meet him in a  vestibule somewhere uptown yeah then we'll see how tough you really are a boxing ring and then he's  perusing the newspaper too he thinks this guy's like a gentleman like i'd like to take you off your  smoking jacket and give you a sock to the face right engage in some fisticuffs it goes on i'm over 80 now 
[00:32:30]  oh jesus what what are you do what are you gonna do he's over 80 and he's gonna take on this like  30 year old crackhead oh ready for this i i think i wait 60 i think i nailed it been writing since  1941 wow this guy wrote about the war and the war great war the big one he wrote about world war ii  ending ww two oh you wrote about it starting yeah pretty much our involvement yeah absolutely 
[00:33:00]  uh i'm over i'm over 80 now so you'd be fighting somebody closer to your own age than a woman you've  been targeting it's deplorable for a 30 something old coward like you to be picking on women of 101 and  85 years of age and i'm sure there's no shortage of guys in their 60s on up who would love to beat  the hell out of you all comers this guy could probably just take these guys like they all run  at him at once like like like the bugs bunny cartoon you could yeah knocking out old people 
[00:33:30]  knocking out old colonists jack lalane will step up and i'll just punch him in the face there's no way  an old guy is going to do anything to that guy god bless bill gallo but stop already and go ahead  and then the next line is just hilarious allow me to be the first and then he writes i did box in  the pal as a kid and continue to mix them up later in the marine corps during world war ii but it was 
[00:34:00]  all in sport i've loved boxing all my life and taught my kids to throw jabs hooks and right crosses  after the war i still sparred with friends in gyms until i was well into my 50s but i've never gotten  angry with an opponent with an opponent i'm not a violent man but what you did to these two wonderful  old ladies has gotten me madder than a wild cat wow he is mad are wild cats really mad no they're  just hungry they're just ah ah ah ah ah ah no who knows if that's them being mad or not here's the 
[00:34:30]  thing can you imagine let's take this a step further yeah let's say how do you organize this  like let's say this guy comes out of hiding and says look i'd like to take that gentleman up on his  offer to fight him do they really promote the fight like yes corner is the thug and in this  corner and you see he's 85 and he's like i really have to fight this guy yeah right he'd be like um  i was writing a column i really didn't mean this i uh look i'm gonna get the crap beat out of me  here i'm just angry typing columnist i don't know i really think that you would take me up on this 
[00:35:00]  he's got his hunchback i'm in it now takes out his takes out his fake teeth his shorts wrapped  like his nipples like old man shorts trying to put them up you he's just got weird patches of hair  all over his body that he just gave up on years ago one punch he's down prostate knocked out  ah well into my 50s but i've never gotten anger okay i'm not a violent man but what you did to  these two wonderful old ladies has gotten me madder than wildcat in the last 40 years or so of my life 
[00:35:30]  i don't ever remember being so damn mad as i am now 40 years this is the maddest he's been are you  kidding what about 9 11 you yeah how about that you dope how about the nazis yes thank you fan he  wrote about the nazis that was more than 40 well he did say 40 years okay oh yeah perhaps you know  recording on okay so it was 60 it was probably 67 liberating concentration camps and then this  how about blacks being hosed down in the middle of streets he wasn't that didn't bug him obviously 
[00:36:00]  uh come out from hiding come out and take my challenge oh god oh my god  he knows what ten thousand dollars for the mugger if he comes out of hiding to take wow now you're  offering 10 grand for the mugger if he comes out of hiding just to fight bill gallo fight him  promote this one don king could promote it uh huge i want to see bill gallo savage in a boxing 
[00:36:30]  the guy won't let up because the ref is trying to get him off of him and he's just overhand writing  his head just pow pow because there are people all over this world that do this they hide behind  their keyboards and stuff and look he's mad he should be mad but stop with like like putting out  a challenge in a uh in a newspaper that everyone's reading how about a ufc fight not just ball jujitsu  mixing it up you could kick him in the face what's the old cod you're gonna do and you know what 
[00:37:00]  there'll be letters in the paper uh in the coming days we we gotta look for that of people going  bravo to you sir you are a man of courage it'll be in tomorrow's paper so make sure we take a look  at that yeah uh you are good for nothing and you just you deserve the beating of your life come on  out you rat and let's get a look at you do you think she's really gonna give him the beating of  his life i don't know i think this guy's probably been in a few brawls probably had the beating of 
[00:37:30]  his life a couple of times like in his crib he's in his 80s he's in his 80s yeah do you think this  guy right now is watching the news going i can't believe i hit her like that yeah wow the purpose  got me nervous man when the whole when you're constantly on television oh yeah like a hundred  year old lady he's gonna really bug your city's looking for you entire city of new york is waiting  for this guy to get caught it's it this story is just huge it's it's it's got uh it's got legs as  they say yeah now there's stories about old folks uh um you know getting into self-defense 
[00:38:00]  oh they're taking self-defense they kind of always show this whenever an old person gets assaulted they  show old people at self-defense classes and you just look at them and go just stop it just stop  you're a victim you're a victim it's like a wounded zebra going to a class at the little side of the  pond yeah it just ain't gonna save you when the lion comes charging at you at 40 miles an hour  exactly now make sure you scream real loud when you throw your punch that'll frighten the attacker 
[00:38:30]  as her little hat goes flying when the attacker grabs her from behind she tries to use the mover she  flips the attacker but instead she just enrages him so he picks her up by her throat and throws her  through a window here we go uh here's what was on the news the self-defense ladies old ladies taking  self-defense watch grace wilson in action and you forget she's 82 years old self-defense class she's 
[00:39:00]  taking involves short but powerful moves for seniors that use an attacker's momentum to gain control of  an opponent oh sure because they're in the 80s they're supposed to start we're using a cane and  feeling sorry for themselves wilson's attending the class after seeing this disturbing attack caught on  surveillance video watch as defenseless 101 year old rose morat gets pummeled in the face not once 
[00:39:30]  but four times by a mugger how about this how about all the old people in that building instead of wasting  their money on self-defense how about they all chip in and get a doorman yeah there you go  there you go a gun oh no here he comes back i gotta remember my self-defense cause  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah 
[00:40:00]  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  dummies come on  it's kind of dangerous to tell your grandma to take self defense take them on when she's never done anything like that in her life before  just give it up apparently she got that knockout blow because she leaned over her walker trying to get her purse back  yeah maybe you should teach the old broads what to do in a situation give up everything give up your thirty dollars and your lotto tickets 
[00:40:30]  yeah don't worry about it teach me how to pop those teeth out and provide a service  here's a little more to the audio  you know we are scared now i don't know how to use self defense but if i was taught i mean i would  uh... try to defend myself the best i can  the glenwood senior center in ridgewood is starting classes for elderly members who want to feel more secure  like grace wilson she offers to demonstrate her moves on me some thirty years her junior 
[00:41:00]  after promising to take me down gently  i realize she is not as frail as she looks  since i'm taking these lessons and doing what i'm doing  honey he get his kick right where he don't want it  there you go  oh honey honey  mhm  old lady kick to the balls  you get his kick right where he  mhm  mhm  poor old people  mhm  mhm  i don't uh...  he  he  he

[00:42:00]  yeah  trying that flip move  oh  just collapse to the floor like a fish that has been thrown into the sand and just lay there until you're rescued  by the way nothing's good enough for our listeners i offer five thousand dollars to the person that turns this creep in  yeah  and they're like the they're calling me cheap well what are you doing  what are you doing  what are you doing  yeah  why don't you come by with your cold hard cash and we'll add it to the uh... we'll add it to the old uh... reward money  i'll even do this i'll say i'll offer forty thousand dollars  wow for what

[00:45:30]  a lot of pressure  they'll get him sooner or later  somebody knows who he is  yeah  well  you turn him in  five thousand dollars from me personally  not from our joint account anthony  which we zeroed out anyway  because we don't trust each other  well  you gotta  never know what's gonna happen  you know  i'm sure  john lennon and paul mccartney  had  great times  anthony and i  we have this corporate account  for whatever show expenses and stuff  and we notice it gets a little too high 
[00:46:00]  and we both call bob secretly  bob it's a little high  every so often it gets a little fat  and we're like  you wanna divvy that up  you wanna move that into some individual accounts please  we gotta move some of this  i wanna stay pretty liquid  but i may wanna invest  no it's not that i don't trust anthony  but  but um you know  keep like ten bucks in there  ten  alright five bucks  we both do the same thing  it's hilarious  alright hey  letters to the editor about the old lady 
[00:46:30]  who wants to take this over here  love these  i highlighted some of the good ones myself  oh you did  yeah  well go ahead and you start there  get the highlighted  yeah you start go ahead  uh... well  i like uh... the first one  i don't know how anyone could possibly think that a goon like this could ever be rehabilitated  hold on hold on what's important to this anthony cause we see the same crap with our radio show  everyone likes to comment about what we're doing wrong with the radio show and they hide behind screen names  they don't use their real names 
[00:47:00]  this first guy is really brave cause his name is news  n-o-o-z guy one  news guy one  yeah  let's see how brave you really are  write these same letters with their real name  first and last  and your address  and a cell phone number  get a knock on the door  yeah  by a guy in a uh... hooded jacket  uh... he could have killed both women  and the fact that they were so elderly and infirm  uh... makes it all the more vicious 
[00:47:30]  give him the needle  give him the needle  he's being tough  he wants to give the guy a nice  easy death penalty  i like this one  yeah which one  p-n-o  bronx  damn  and she spelled damn  d-a-m  idiots from the bronx  why  lots of whys  that wasn't right at all  when i see the playback on this  i was not too happy 
[00:48:00]  but what a  what a risk taker  this poster is  i was not too happy  i was not too happy  why  that's the worst thing i've seen in a long time  how are you going to punch her  not once  but about four to five times  and he couldn't put her down  he had to push her to the floor  and then  in capital letters  you go grandma  i wish i knew who this guy was  or rather i wish i was walking down the block when that happened  no you don't  why  no you don't  i mean  you think that while you're behind your keyboard 
[00:48:30]  but no one wants to see this animal face to face for the most part  uh... brooklyn kid  it's a shame before god for someone to do such a thing  jail is too good for this poor excuse for a human  payback will come in spades for this fool  well  where's the one where they want to throw the book at him  yeah  oh phantom  this was a dreadful attack on the old and feeble  i watched a video clip on the news last night  i was absolutely dismayed  i think the book should be thrown at this guy 
[00:49:00]  throw the book at him  1950 talk  the hell does that mean  throw the book at him  uh...  what other ones you want to read really fast here  how about bronxgirl  74 bxgrl 74  typical  that's all i  that's all i'll say on that  oh  you gotta love her  typical huh  first thing i thought  when i saw this on tv i was so angry i hope the police catch this  and then capitalize animal 
[00:49:30]  soon  jail time should be  life with no parole for this animal  ooh  like this guy doesn't know jail  here's a t-y-s-e-n-s 13  another person hiding behind their screen name instead of using their real name  and this is for the this isn't a wacky message board  this is in the in a respectable newspaper here in new york  uh... it's a long letter but this line  caught my attention  i hope they catch him and turn some of the seniors loose on him with their canes 
[00:50:00]  walkers whatever and beat the crap out of him  like clockwork orange  where the old people are beating alex  yeah  diamond lou has a good one  the only question is where is the big mouth al sharpton now why is he not crying for justice now  it is interesting how not one black leader  has stuck their stupid face out to make a remark  not even comment on it  not even commenting  who cares  jailhouse doc 
[00:50:30]  it's my favorite  that clown is a punk coward plain and simple  let him go against someone who could give him a run for his money  and his skirt would drop right down  if he gets locked up the other inmates will form a conga line on him  and he will have hemorrhoids that no amount of preparation h will soothe  this guy's kind of painting a picture isn't he  hopefully he will be caught and even the crooks in protective custody on rikers will make his life unbearable  he's not even talking about the criminal he's talking about the kids from american idol 
[00:51:00]  and then  did you see dr phil another person hiding behind their fake screen name  put me in the ring with this little fart and i'll show you rocky balboa gone wild  he'll be walking like an egyptian for a few decades  and then he ends it with the a-hole  but he spells it arse  a-r-s-e  yeah  blah blah blah  get into quite the donny brook with the guy huh  yeah if you want some entertainment uh you know go read the letters together in your paper 
[00:51:30]  the rocky thing  yeah  hopefully the guy would wind up like mickey  but rocky balboa  he probably would too  but rocky balboa isn't real  that's exactly what the scene would look like if that idiot columnist there  what was his name  hill gallo  yeah  uh if he if he uh uh got in the ring  with this uh beast  it would look just like clubber lang  bitch slapping mickey 
[00:52:00]  ah  rock  ah  i'll  i'll get him rock  here he is  come on get in the ring  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  and rocky wants to help him the whole time but uh  yeah 
[00:52:30]  but mickey's like no i can handle this one rock  i can handle it  you just sit there and watch what i do to this punk  i'll get this punk  we'll fight fair and square  come on punk  put up your dukes  oh  hey mickey  he brought a shovel into the ring rock  he's caving my skull in rock  ah 
[00:53:00]  ah  don't worry i can handle this one  oh my head looks like oatmeal  ha  I don't think that's allowed in the ring, sir.  Apparently it is.  I just like the visual of him taking him on,  and Rocky's not allowed to do anything  because Mickey just thinks he can handle this punk.  Go on, Mickey.  He's picking me up.  Oh, no, he's doing...  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa! 
[00:53:30]  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Oh, God, Rocky.  Ow!  Oh, God, Rocky's just waiting for the call.  Come on, let me get in there.  Hey, let me in, Mickey.  Maybe I can help you out with the guy.  No, I'll handle him, Rock.  I'll handle him.  My wool cap is full of stew, 
[00:54:00]  but I can...  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Stupid Anthony's doing old-school radio.  What, do you want to, like, do the horse noise, too?  I need coconuts.  He's running me over with a horse, Rock.  Rocky, he's running me over with a horse.  Oh!  Oh, no, Rock. 
[00:54:30]  He's picked up a dolphin.  He's hitting me with a dolphin.  Ow!  Not a sheep!  Ah!  We're not even close to the water.  We're not even close to the water.  How's he doing this?  Mickey, any time, you know, you want a little help,  just kind of chime in,  or maybe I'll punch the guy or something. 
[00:55:00]  I've been trading for this fight.  Looks like you could use a little help.  I hit a tiger, Mickey.  I hit a tiger.  All right, Rock.  Why am I at the end of a bowling alley?  Ow!  Ow!  He's bowling in Tintomy.  Ow!  What do you mean, is it safe?  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  He's drilling my teeth, Rock!  Rock, he's drilling my teeth!  Ow! 
[00:55:30]  Oh!  Now he's offering me some oil of clove, Rock.  Just say the word.  No!  I'll handle him, Rock.  Just raise your hand or something.  No, not the dolphin again!  I just love this visual.  Just raise your hand and I'll help you, Mickey.  Oh! 
[00:56:00]  Oh, no, not the...  He hit me with a horse, Rock.  Oh, no.  What's he pulling out of his pocket, Rock?  I'll get him if you want.  No, I got him.  He tased me, Rock.  Just say the word, Bick. 
[00:56:30]  I got your back.  I got him, Rock.  Not a problem.  I've chased chickens.  I can beat up this big spade.  You want a piece of me?  You want a piece of me?  That's exactly what it would look like.  With all these people that are brave enough to take this puck on.  80-year-old columnist is going to beat up this guy.  Oh, man.  That's a...  Very funny.  Why would he hit him with a dolphin? 
[00:57:00]  Like, people would just accept that and watch it.  Like, here's the thing.  The dolphin would have to be sitting somewhere for him to grab it.  Like, no one would question why there was a dolphin by the side of the ring.  But he's just pummeling the old guy with it.  Yeah.  He picks up this endangered animal and hits an elderly man with his gloves on.  How do you do that with your gloves on?  I don't even know how you'd hold them.  They're slippery.  Let's go to Larry on Long Island.  Larry!  Hey, what's going on? 
[00:57:30]  Larry.  Larry.  Larry.  Morning, morning, morning.  Quick thing before I get to my questions, you guys.  As far as Zanjaya, Patrice has totally become a queer.  There's no way of defending that when you sit there and fanalizing and titillating about  some young boy who's under 18, nonetheless.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's just...  His theory is just kind of funny.  Yeah.  That's all.  No, it is funny.  It is funny.  And he's real straight.  Anyway, so, well, my question was, when they do catch this guy, how much time is he really  going to do for stealing 33 bucks and not even using a weapon?  Well... 
[00:58:00]  And is there, like, a law for people that are over, like, 65?  Is it, like, worst punishment for that?  Oh, you know, funny you should mention that, as people like to say, but they want to make  a felony if you mug someone over 70 years old.  If you assault them.  Apparently, it's a misdemeanor to punch an old person in the face.  Right.  So, the guy really...  You're right.  The guy wouldn't get much time.  And the lawyer would plea bargain it down, and it would be like, hey, look, he's got a  drug problem. 
[00:58:30]  He was high on dope, and he's cleaning himself up.  They pull out all those usual crap defenses.  I think the age is too low, though, man.  70-year-olds can be tough.  Right.  And I think if it's his first defense, he's probably going to just get commutative.  Honestly, he's not going to get much time in the end, but then everyone's going to know  who he is, and, you know, his life is just going to be hell.  But here's the law.  The New York legislators proposed a new law yesterday that would make a felony to assault  anyone older than 70 and hit the assailant with a maximum of four years in the slammer. 
[00:59:00]  So, they're trying to get that passed.  I think they should actually go at 60.  That's the difference between that, like regular hate crimes.  Like, everybody will be old if we live long.  I mean, that's not a black thing or a gay thing.  That's every person will be covered by that.  You live long enough, you're going to be old.  I guess that they prey on the elderly, so now they want to, you know, protect the elderly  by having this new law.  So, it's pretty interesting.  You should.  You should get more than four years, too, man.  If you punch an old lady in the face like that, you should get ten years.  That's brutal. 
[00:59:30]  I mean, he really just, like, clocked her until she fell down.  He had her money.  He had everything.  She leaned over to grab her bag, I guess.  He could have just, like, mushed her.  He could have given a mush.  Or, yeah, leave the building.  She probably had just a little birthday card in there for her great-great-great-grandson  or something.  That's all her day was going to be, was trying to get to the post office and mail the damn  thing.  She lights a candle.  She took her driving money for church.  Yeah.  Well, you didn't have to hit her for that.  Like, what you do, when she went to grab the purse, he could have just raised his hand  up like he was going to slap her, and she would have backed. 
[01:00:00]  I mean, that's what I always do.  Like, if I'm trying to get in line and there's some old people, I'll go, hey.  You're just like, like, you're going to backhand them, and they back right off.  Yeah, they understand.  All right.  Great show.  Great.  Thank you, guys.  You guys are the best.  Larry.  Thank you.  Bye.  Hey, really fast.  This is Saturday at Bro's Restaurant.  Yeah.  All right.  We're doing St. Paddy's Day.  I was there this weekend, and he wants to start the festivities at, like, 1130 in the  morning.  That's good.  Well, we're doing karaoke later on in the night.  We're doing, like, St. Paddy's Day karaoke. 
[01:00:30]  We don't really have to promote this because it's a small place, but it is going down.  I just want to make sure people know that.  Oh, yeah.  It's going to be packed.  Believe me.  It's the restaurant I own with my two brothers.  Brett is the, you know, it's really his place.  We're just, like, silent partners that hang out and just kind of make sure everyone's having  a good time.  But it's 400 New York Avenue in the heart of Huntington Village, FH Riley's, this Saturday.  What's wrong there, Jimmy?  These scumbag attorneys, this guy who killed Jessica Lunsford, who buried her alive, they're 
[01:01:00]  showing, like, the brain scans of him and a normal person, like, that should avoid the  death penalty because he raped a nine-year-old and buried her alive.  And they're showing you the brain scan, like, that's somehow going to excuse it or should  spare his life.  Lawyers should just be shot.  Yeah, the defense is saying that he's got the mind of a child.  No, he doesn't.  He took the life of a child.  That's about it. 
[01:01:30]  Just kill this guy already.  If this guy doesn't get the death penalty, we're just doomed.  Just give the father an aluminum bat, if that's what the family wants, and allow him  to just chain this guy to a chair and just kill him.  Yeah.  Chain him to a chair.  First, the ankles, work your way up the groin.  Question on Good Morning America, should killer get death?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, he raped and buried a nine-year-old alive.  I think that pretty much covers what the death penalty is for.  Buried her alive.  It's horrible. 
[01:02:00]  Actually convinced her to get into this bag by saying that he was, get into the bag so  I could take you home.  That's what he told her.  And got her to get into this bag, close the bag up, threw in the hole, and buried her.  So she was completely alive and conscious.  Did he say why he did that?  No, he won't say why.  He won't say why.  He said he was scared.  He didn't.  He actually broke into the house, meaning to steal things.  But then on an impulse, took her. 
[01:02:30]  And, you know, that's an impulse.  So then you rape her and then throw in her bag and bury her alive.  And they found, when they dug her up, they actually found that she had poked a few fingers  out of the bag.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  I mean, just the worst possible crime you could think of.  You can't even fathom a more horrible crime than what this guy did.  And you actually have to contemplate whether he gets the death penalty.  If this guy doesn't get the death penalty, then there should be no death penalty for anything 
[01:03:00]  ever.  How can anybody, anybody think this guy has any redeeming value as a human being?  We absolutely have the right to squash this bug.  What's prison going to do?  If he's got the mind of a child, then he's not going to appreciate the full impact of  the horrors of prison.  It's just going to be him sitting there going like an idiot.  But, so, kill him.  Just kill him.  Get rid of him.  What do we got to make believe we're so civilized and above that? 
[01:03:30]  What are these people that just think, oh, no, you know, the taking of a life for another  is just as bad as the, no, it isn't.  No.  We're not that civilized.  Stop it.  It was just a very short time ago.  We were just throwing spears at each other.  Could we just put this guy to death?  And I hate that goddamn lethal injection.  Hate it.  Yeah.  Make the death penalty as horrific as it should be.  As it sounds.  As it sounds.  Yeah, the death penalty. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  It's not just going to sleep.  Yeah.  Has anyone had, you know, an operation or anything where you had to be put to sleep for a little  while?  Is that, like, horrible?  You don't even remember it.  You get a needle put in your arm, and then you're waking up.  Only this time, you know, you don't wake up.  But it's just over.  What's with a firing squad or a guillotine?  I mean, why is that so considered so barbaric?  I like a cage on his belly with a rat inside the cage. 
[01:04:30]  Hungry rat.  And the rat is really hungry.  Or they also have the, you lay down on the cage with the rat, and then you heat the bottom  of the cage.  So the rat has to eat through you to get out of the hot cage.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a good one.  That is a very good one.  Yeah.  We saw some of those medieval tortures.  Where were we?  Did they do that?  I think it was some one of those.  Renaissance fair?  No.  I think it was, like, spooky world or something.  I don't remember where we were, but.  Yeah.  I was in Massachusetts.  All right.  And they would do that?  They would heat the cage for the rat to eat?  Yeah. 
[01:05:00]  So the rat would have to eat through you.  Yeah.  We didn't just make these up.  We actually saw these, and they swear this is what they used to do back in the day.  They would get a hungry rat and put a cage on your belly with, obviously, no floor to  the cage, so your belly's the floor of the cage.  And the rat would just start eating you away.  What about the metal cone?  It looked like an ice cream cone made of metal, and it was turned upside down, pointy side  up, and they would lower you down on top of this thing till the point made contact 
[01:05:30]  with a place in your body that is usually meant for things not to go into.  Right.  And they would lower you down onto this thing.  And as you got lowered down, of course, the diameter gets bigger and bigger and bigger  until you just get ripped into pieces.  What are you not confessing in that situation?  What information is so valuable that you're tolerating that nonsense? 
[01:06:00]  God, I've never even thought of it that way.  You are telling everything.  Everything.  All they have to do is go, do you see that cone?  And you go, is that what I think it's for?  And they go, yeah.  And you go, get a pen.  I will write everything.  You want photos, everything.  No problem.  Information coming.  Yeah.  All right.  We got to take a break.  I think we have Doug Stanhope coming in to say hi today.  We do, yes.  Oh, cool.  Oh, sweet.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  It's Whip Em Out Wednesday.  I just got wowed. 
[01:06:30]  I got wowed.  I just got wowed.  Oh, thank God for Opie and Anthony.  Thank you, Opie and Anthony.  Get a wow sticker.  Get flashed.  Get happy.  Details on.  God forbid we mention a website.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, good morning.  What's wrong, Jimmy?  Um, I had sex last night.  Oh.  What? 
[01:07:00]  Congrats.  Yeah.  How many jumps on the trampoline?  Oh, fantastic.  Boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing.  Non-stop.  Boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing.  It was, uh, boing.  Really good.  Boing.  Really good.  Boing.  In slow motion?  Boing.  Yeah, then you stop for a little while.  Boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing.  Whoa.  It was really good.  Um.  But.  Best sex in a long time.  But.  There's a but.  There's always a but.  I just.  It's awful. 
[01:07:30]  Afterwards, we're standing in the, uh, in the bathroom.  And, like, she didn't mean to say it.  But she's, like, looking at herself.  Because she hasn't worked out as much in the last two weeks.  And she's, she's like, am I getting fat too?  Oh, no.  She didn't add the two in.  Yeah, she did.  Most women will ask you, am I getting fat?  Do I look fat?  But they never say, am I getting fat too?  She actually stopped the, this was even worse than that.  She stopped the two.  She's like, am I getting fat? 
[01:08:00]  And then she stopped and tried playing it off.  That's what she, and I'm like, did you have to?  And then she, we, we laughed probably for a good five minutes at it.  And I didn't like the way she tried to play it off.  And then I just got annoyed.  I'm like, you know.  Oh, no.  There was an uncomfortable laugh, though, right?  Because you knew.  Well, it was genuinely funny.  But it was just like, ugh.  Why?  And you came in today with a groin injury.  So you probably went right to the gym to do more crunches.  No, I worked out yesterday afternoon.  And I do have like a, I feel like I got to pull a groin full. 
[01:08:30]  Because ouch.  Oh.  Yeah, it hurts.  That really, it's like, what's, why?  Groin.  But you, you're not fat.  It's just a.  No.  You've lost a lot of weight, Jimmy.  You look great.  People comment all the time.  They say, look how much weight Jimmy's lost.  You look great.  Yeah, but.  Just be the AIDS.  Don't pull a Richard Jenny on us, buddy.  No, I'm not bummed.  You all right?  Then the line, then she's like, no, I was just, shut up.  I know what you said.  I speak English.  It's a thing called common language we have.  You guys are very volatile.  Yeah.  Your relationship is very volatile. 
[01:09:00]  Am I wrong, though?  Would that drive you nuts?  Like, it's almost like, what are you doing?  I would be really bummed.  You would, right?  Yeah.  I'm not even trying to make radio.  No, no, I know.  I'd be like, oh, man.  That sucks.  Our true feelings just came out.  Absolutely.  Don't try to doll it up.  Don't try to, well, no, I meant, no.  Am I a disgusting pig like you?  That's pretty much what she was saying.  Yeah, I know exactly what she was saying.  I know.  Especially if I was just naked on top of you and next to you and laying with you.  Aw. 
[01:09:30]  You know what I mean?  It's not like we just came in from skiing.  And we've all seen your girlfriend.  She's not anywhere.  You wouldn't call her fat?  Not at all.  No, no, no.  So what was she looking at?  Like, just a little, like, maybe the hint of something that might someday become a role.  She has abs.  Like, you can see her abs.  You can see what she ate.  Yeah, she really threw the ab muscle.  Slender.  So she had a little, uh, that was just one of those moments where she was just like,  but she said, it came out.  That was the worst.  Wow.  I'm sorry. 
[01:10:00]  Oh, no, you should.  It was very, I mean, I laughed then.  I had to.  As a comic, I had to laugh.  But then it just weighed on you.  It just annoyed me.  Was it one of those Austin Power laughs where it was really funny?  And then finally the laughter kind of dies.  And then it's all awkward.  Well, it was like, yeah, we both knew the reality of it.  It was like, I know what you're saying.  You don't, don't try to change.  Oh, Jimmy, look, we can help you out.  Brad's got it for you.  Brad in Jersey.  Brad, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Jimmy, maybe you took it out of context. 
[01:10:30]  Maybe she was referring to the rest of society that's overweight and not necessarily you.  Am I getting fat, too, like the rest of the country, our obese nation?  No.  That was in reference to the shapeless amoeba she had just had sex with.  Because you're starting to think, like, what was she looking at and thinking about when we were having sex?  I always think that.  Because then, you know, you're both nude.  So she's able to, like, look.  And was she looking and going, oh, look at that roll. 
[01:11:00]  Just, like, going back and forth.  I could see it rippling like the tide.  And then you think that when she was saying two, you know.  Yeah, I know it was.  I'm getting fat, too.  And that's just like, don't try to make me feel better.  Don't just stop.  I'm too old for that.  So you're really annoyed, Jimmy?  Just, you know, why?  But you know what?  I mean, everyone's entitled to their opinion.  And that's kind of what makes our country great.  Everyone talks and says whatever they want to say.  And, you know, if you're going to be a pig about it and insult your boyfriend, that's up to you. 
[01:11:30]  Who cares how I feel?  As long as you're happy, that's all that really matters.  Because I care about you and you care about me.  And we all have little verbal misadmissions.  No big deal.  You know, if you want to have sex and then just speak your mind and humiliate me, I mean, you feel free to do that.  And then pretend you didn't mean it.  I know exactly what you meant.  But I have put a few pounds on lately, so why not be honest with each other?  Because honesty is the best policy.  There's no reason not to be honest.  You know?  We should just kind of talk openly.  Especially if one of us is going to be devastated by it again. 
[01:12:00]  So I'm so happy.  All right.  Thank you, Brad.  I hope the faithful listeners don't mind, but I've got to explain something to the new listeners.  Is that okay?  I got douche chills.  Is that okay that we just stop the show for two seconds to bring other people on board?  So we can continue doing this show because we'll have a bigger audience?  What was that?  I don't know.  I was a car crashing something.  That's Jimmy's calming music.  We learned a long time ago that he loves that song and it makes him happy.  There you go.  That took ten seconds, but now more people are on board. 
[01:12:30]  MacBook Karaoke is back.  Go to www.923freefm.com for details.  Yeah, we're giving away a bunch of MacBooks again, Anthony.  Very, very cool.  We did this a few months ago and it was a huge hit.  Made a star.  That's right.  With the MacBook, you can create everything from music, movies, greeting cards, podcasts,  websites, and more.  Head to the Apple Store or apple.com to check it out.  And we are going to kick off MacBook Karaoke today with the star of the last one we did. 
[01:13:00]  Oh, wow.  She is here today.  Oh, good.  To sing a brand new song for us, but you may remember Pamela doing this little number.  She pretty much had the best karaoke song that came in the last time we did it.  I've got a new life.  You would hardly recognize me.  I'm so glad I'm your present.  I'm here with you. 
[01:13:30]  I don't bother.  You're not the one for me.  Is it not enough?  I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  Life is demanding without understanding.  I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  No one's going to drag you up to get into the light where you belong. 
[01:14:00]  Look how it feels where you belong.  That's Pamela.  She's coming in today and she's singing Like a Virgin live for all of us.  Oh, like a virgin.  Like a virgin.  We saw the pictures.  Who are you kidding?  And she is willing to talk about the photos that turned up on the internet.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We have our own scandal like American Idol.  We sure do.  It's just like it, isn't it?  Some scandalous pictures showed up.  It's just like it because we do talk to a lot of people every morning. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  There were some pictures that showed up of her doing some things that a virgin wouldn't be doing.  I was at a party.  Yeah.  Another girl.  Yeah.  And a little touching.  Very hot pictures.  A little touching was going on.  Jimmy, you all right?  I'm just irritated.  Oh, no.  Did it irritate me now?  Yeah.  Thinking about it.  I see you're thinking about it again.  Yeah, it just hit me.  She loves you.  Big deal.  Good for her.  She loves me.  You know what?  She loves me. 
[01:15:00]  And this is what's annoying me.  I don't even think she knows this.  Yeah.  Because I'm, I mean, I know that she's attractive to me, but it's because I'm stable and secure  to a certain degree.  It's like women don't like to acknowledge that that all of a sudden really plays into  their thinking.  And it's not a money thing.  It's just the fact that like, all right, he's a responsible guy.  He doesn't drink.  He doesn't get high.  He doesn't work.  You know, like this.  It's less things they have to worry about.  Yes.  So that goes into a lot.  I told her the last time I said to her, you love me from the neck up.  I know you love what's in my head.  I know that.  But the rest of it you tolerate because it's attached to the brain. 
[01:15:30]  Wow.  That's what it is.  And what'd she say to that?  Oh, that's what she was going to say.  Yeah.  I mean, she had to say that.  She was going to say, yeah.  So you gave her a question she couldn't possibly answer.  No, I didn't.  I didn't even ask her.  You're another one that just simplifies everything perfectly for everybody.  What is she going to say?  Well, all right.  Yeah, she had to kind of disagree with it, but I think I wasn't, I wasn't fishing.  I wasn't asking.  I was telling her that's what it is.  Right.  She doesn't seem to get that.  But people let you know that their true feelings come out at moments like that. 
[01:16:00]  But they say women like guys for their brains and stuff.  They do, which is fine.  And their sense of humor and all that.  Absolutely.  I've been getting late my whole life because of my sense of humor.  My whole life has been, which is fine.  I mean, look, it's better than, you know.  Is she really into the sex?  Yeah.  See?  Oh, yeah.  That's all you have to worry about.  That's all you have to worry about.  Yeah, but still, man.  It's like, you hear that, and you're like, ugh, it just nullifies everything.  What are we doing?  This sucks.  Hey, but you got a gig this weekend.  I'm glad I'm gone for four days. 
[01:16:30]  I'm gone for four days next week.  In Boston, I'm glad.  Yeah?  Yes.  Not to be away from the show, but just to go away.  Yep.  Where are you going to be this weekend, Jimmy?  Ontario, California.  I'm sure we have eight people there.  It's an hour north of L.A., the improv.  Ooh.  Yeah.  That's where you want to be, an hour north of the major city.  I was trying to work an hour west, but that's the Pacific Ocean.  Maybe they could get a little raft for you.  People could pull up in their little boats.  I could do a set for Tom Hanks and Wilson, a little faggity ball before it floats away. 
[01:17:00]  Dude, we should do that this summer as a goof.  Find somewhere, maybe the Long Island Sound or whatever, and just have Jimmy on a raft,  and you do a set for boaters that decide to pull up.  The boats.  That would be so fun.  How about Voss on a raft?  Or Bob Kelly on a raft?  Yeah, why you?  I get seasick.  Yeah, why you?  Let's do Voss and Bob Kelly.  They would do it.  We should do just a couple sets on the water for boaters.  Yeah.  And you just pull up. 
[01:17:30]  Oh, that's hysterical.  Gotta go.  Oh, that's funny.  You're having fun with your little machine today.  Yeah.  I love my machine.  We got a little intel here.  What's going on?  Sam has...  Oh, there's Sam.  I'm hearing things.  Candy in his head?  Well, we're doing the Janet and Nick bit this week.  See, we're attacking the really tough radio shows out there.  Yeah.  And this week, we're focusing on the Janet and Nick show from Buffalo. 
[01:18:00]  Don't they even sound tough?  They sound very tough.  Let's be honest.  We're the mugger, and Janet and Nick, they're like the 101-year-old lady.  That just wants to go to church.  You can see their little cap go flying off their cotton candy hair.  So, the bit is...  It probably has run its course by now.  We're acknowledging that.  But we started something else.  We want to see how far Sam can take this before the bit is obviously over. 
[01:18:30]  And I heard a rumor that you have a piece of audio just in your back pocket  that will guarantee this bit continues.  Ace in the hole?  He has an ace in the hole.  Quite literally.  So...  Wow.  See, he even has it in his back pocket.  Oh, you sly dog.  So, basically, his whole job is to listen to Janet and Nick in Buffalo,  find some just awful audio, and then we throw some beeps in it and make it funnier, right?  Make it sound like they were really being naughty. 
[01:19:00]  But this guy, he just handed in the latest Janet and Nick audio,  but if he didn't find this today, he was going to go to his back pocket  and break out the guaranteed...  The spare, the guarantee, the in-case-of-emergency break glass.  It's actually there, just in case one sinks.  It's like an extra life.  It's an extra life.  I got something on my back pocket.  He's collected an extra life.  Oh, all right.  So, let's say this sucks today.  Right.  And we go, oh, well, obviously, it's over. 
[01:19:30]  You're going to go, oh, and you're going to hand over the disc.  I got this one.  Try to save the bit.  I've been holding on to this since Monday morning.  This is their first break Monday morning.  Wow.  Ten seconds long.  But here's the problem.  Yeah.  You have to use this before the end of the week,  because then we move on to some other show next week.  Right, of course.  Or we might even rest a bit next week.  Yeah.  So, now I want to hear it.  So, sometime between now and the end of the week,  you will break out the bit from your back pocket.  Yeah, it might be today.  Wouldn't it be good if... 
[01:20:00]  It might be today?  It sucked.  Oh, no.  Wouldn't it be great if it sucked?  And we didn't know what it was,  and we're just like, eh, that one is nice.  These guys have heard it.  They said it's a guarantee.  Oh, it is?  It's a guarantee to keep the bit going.  Yeah.  All right, well, here's Janet and Nick from today out of Buffalo.  We're moving Buffalo.  How is this number two one that you just gave us?  It's not bad.  Oh, no.  All right, here's Janet and Nick on their show this morning?  Yeah, this is this morning.  Out of Buffalo, New York.  Listen to this terrific radio.  Her name is Christine. 
[01:20:30]  Hi, Christine.  Hi, how are you?  Good.  Are you nervous?  I'm very nervous.  You're calling 98, Christine.  Oh, my God.  You get a chance to crack the code and win a free vacation from KISS 98.5.  Oh, my God.  I can still use it, too.  Where would you go?  Um, I don't know.  I'm thinking definitely somewhere warm, maybe either California or Florida.  Okay.  You know how yesterday was such a nice, clear day for early morning and watching one of those  Southwest flights come in? 
[01:21:00]  Oh.  And I started dreaming.  I'm like, man, think about just going anywhere that plane is taken off to next.  I know that.  I was thinking that if I was at home watching them fly over me.  Oh, that's what I'm talking about.  Take me.  Hopefully it's value jet and it's going to the front.  Like, guys should never admit that they're dreaming.  I just saw the plane taken off.  I was dreaming.  Do you think he really was, though?  Yes.  Listen to the guy.  He obviously does a lot of dreaming. 
[01:21:30]  It's a little fruity.  Hmm.  So, uh, that was them doing what?  Their contest where they just give out numbers, I guess, and you have to write the numbers down?  Something like that.  And then you call in with the right numbers and then you win a trip somewhere?  Yep.  Yeah.  That's what I love about radio.  These dumb programmers out there, they think that's going to get the job done.  It's called a time spent listening contest.  Yeah.  You want to get your TSL up, it's called.  So you make them linger longer.  Lunger. 
[01:22:00]  Make them stay there listening, waiting for their code.  They have what's called like nine to five contests.  Yeah.  So basically you have to listen to the radio station all day.  So let's say the jock that's on at nine will give you a part of some kind of code  and then go, don't forget to listen to blah, blah, too.  He'll give you the next clue.  Next clue will be coming up.  It's too much work as a listener.  So then you're like, oh, I've got to listen at two now.  And then you'll listen at two.  Sometime between.  Right.  Yeah, they'll tell you.  And then the two o'clock jock somewhere in that hour will give you the next clue. 
[01:22:30]  And don't forget, listen at five o'clock during the five o'clock funnies or the five o'clock traffic jam  for your final clue.  And then call Janet and Nick tomorrow morning.  Oh, it's just too much work.  Yeah.  Just stupid contest.  And then they're yapping with that contestant who was putting me to sleep.  All right.  Well, you took that audio and made it funnier, brought them into our world, the shock jock world. 
[01:23:00]  Shock jock.  And you're feeling confident that this will continue the bit, right?  Yes.  All right.  Here we go.  Janet and Nick from Buffalo.  Funnier because Sam made them funny.  Her name is Christine.  Hi, Christine.  Hi, how are you?  Good.  You nervous?  I'm very nervous.  You're calling 98, Christine.  Oh, my God.  You get a chance to win a f*** from Kiss 98.5.  Oh, my God.  I can still use it, too.  Where would you f***?  Um, I don't know. 
[01:23:30]  I'm thinking definitely somewhere warm, maybe either California or Florida.  Okay.  You know how yesterday was such a nice clear day for f***?  Oh.  And I started dreaming.  I'm like, man, think about just f***ing anywhere that plane is taken off to next.  I know that.  I was thinking that as I was driving home watching him f***ing.  Oh, that's what I'm talking about.  F*** me.  Christine.  Me.  Great.  I don't think you have to break class today. 
[01:24:00]  Nope.  All right.  You made Janet and Nick funnier.  Right?  Not one of my favorites.  Not one of your...  Yeah, yeah.  It kind of...  You want to break class?  There were a couple of moments there that weren't quite there.  Like, the Florida-California thing didn't quite make sense.  Are you saying that something wasn't up to snuff?  Yes, it wasn't up to snuff.  The California-Florida thing could have been a couple bleeps because he asked, you know,  where you want to bleep and she could have, like, said... 
[01:24:30]  Well, I'm thinking about bleep and bleep, you know, which would have made you think front  and back kind of thing.  Yeah.  It didn't make sense.  Like, why would she do what she was doing?  Why would she have to go to Florida or California to do that?  Yeah.  Let's go to Tommy in Jersey.  Tommy.  Not the best one.  Hey.  Yeah.  You guys, you know, this is terrible.  Every day you guys are talking about different radio stations and stuff.  You've got to move on from this.  All right.  No, you're right.  You raise a good point. 
[01:25:00]  Why do you say that, Tommy?  You guys are great.  You don't need to...  Oh, shut up, Tommy.  Stop it.  If you don't like this segment, then you do what you have to do and go...  Go somewhere else.  That's how it works.  Go eat up grapefruit.  I love the people that think that, you know, that we just have something that's obviously  funnier just sitting there that we're not getting to.  Absolutely.  This is what we chose to do this break.  If you don't like it, you go somewhere else.  Yeah, Tommy.  You know, after that Rocky bit that Anthony did, we don't even have to broadcast for the 
[01:25:30]  rest of the day.  Oh, we'll just ride it.  Because at the end of the day, guess what?  That's what you're going to be talking about anyway.  Just ride our...  I love the people, though.  It's like we just have...  Our successes.  We just have funny stacked all around us and we chose the wrong funny.  You know what I mean?  Guess what?  If we weren't doing this bit right now, we'd have nothing to talk about.  My God.  I'll show my cards.  Hand it over.  All right.  If it's not getting funnier after this one.  Because, yeah, even Mike from Jersey is saying...  Yeah.  All right. 
[01:26:00]  Well, Mike's still listening because he's not going anywhere.  No.  This is John and Nick.  We broke the glass.  Yes.  And you're guaranteeing that this will keep the bit going, right?  Yes.  All right.  It's been horrible.  So as we get used to this, like, moving our clocks ahead, wow, really dark this morning.  6.23.  Yeah, for the middle of the night.  Hard for the joggers, I would say.  I can't see this is going to be a good one.  All right.  Listen.  Yeah, okay.  Hey, Mike. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  No one cares.  Goodbye.  Uh-oh.  All right.  So the audio is only a couple seconds.  Yep.  Wow.  I think that's better.  All right.  Here we go.  Janet and Nick, funnier, edgier.  Uh-huh.  Oh, boy.  Hold on a minute.  Uncomfortable moment.  Well, that'd be good if it doesn't work.  So as we get used to this, like, moving our clocks ahead, wow, really dark this morning. 
[01:27:00]  6.23.  Yeah, the middle of the night.  Hard for the joggers, I would say.  Wow.  Oh, a single beep.  Oh, he went with a single beep.  A single beep.  That was good.  Dude, I was in a panic.  I'm like, are you crazy?  You didn't bleep the clock and go right there?  As soon as I heard joggers, I thought winner.  Oh, yeah.  That is a good one.  Short, sweet, one beep.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  You know exactly what's going on there. 
[01:27:30]  Very nice there.  There you go.  Bit still on.  All right.  We'll decide when it's over.  Yeah.  Not some dopey listener that has to go to a stupid job.  Yeah.  Watch him be a doctor.  Huh?  Watch him be a doctor.  He's working on cures for cancer.  Exactly.  Your stupid job.  I'm telling Steve to quickly load that fart noise.  Shall we have it for the next break?  Right.  Well, all right.  You're right.  No reality there.  Pamela's here.  Good.  She's going to sing Like a Virgin. 
[01:28:00]  Great.  You know, and I'll save you the time.  This is what we're doing next because we have nothing else to do.  Yeah.  This is what we thought might be funny.  So kill us if you don't think it's funny.  Anthony, something we wanted to play a while ago, and we ran out of time.  Speaking of contest pigs, we had a few requests for the Donna Summer phone call.  Oh, boy.  This one's taking you way back.  Way, way back.  Yeah.  We used to have the concert pigs call our show because the numbers were very similar to one 
[01:28:30]  of these dumb Janet and Nick type shows where they were just giving away trips and things  like that.  And this lady called.  She had no idea who we were.  Never heard of us.  Never heard of the show.  She really thought she was calling the other station.  I forgot the station.  I think it was Mix or something.  We always fished the information out of them because we got so many of these calls.  We knew exactly when they called, just by the sound of their voice, that they weren't  one of our listeners.  Why, because it was female?  Yeah, female and a little older.  So we just started fishing for answers, asking her questions so she'd give us the right answer. 
[01:29:00]  We'd be like, yeah.  We were amazed that they got so excited because they're going to win Donna Summer tickets.  Donna Summer.  So we had some fun.  Listen to this as we go to break.  On the way, Doug Stanhope and Pamela Smart doing Like a Virgin to kick off MacBook Karaoke  for us.  Am I the right caller?  What were you calling for?  Donna Summer tickets.  Donna Summer tickets.  Are you a big Donna Summers fan? 
[01:29:30]  Oh, yes, but I'm more of a f**king .5 fan.  Oh, boy.  Here we go.  She knows the right things to say.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Let me tell you something.  Mm-hmm.  You're going to see Donna Summer.  You're kidding.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Matter of fact, we're going to put you in the front row.  What do you say?  For Donna Summer.  What do you say?  I don't believe it.  Thank you very much.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Hey, what color panties are you wearing?  I'm wearing a bathing suit.  Donna Summer wants to know, what kind of bathing suit are you wearing? 
[01:30:00]  A one-piece, a thong, bikini?  A bikini.  I'm sun tanning.  Sun tanning.  And I'm by my pool with my radio with .5 on.  Oh, boy.  She says it again.  Look at that.  Since she's mentioned the station so many times, I think another prize is in order.  You like the disco era?  Yes, I do.  The whole disco dancing thing?  Absolutely.  How about a disco weekend in Las Vegas, Nevada? 
[01:30:30]  That's right.  You'll be whisked away to Las Vegas, Nevada to see Donna Summer in Las Vegas.  Are you serious?  We are serious.  I can't believe this.  You just have to tell us one thing.  What?  What's the strangest object you've ever used during sex?  The what?  Donna wants to know.  Nothing.  You're a virgin.  No.  You're a big, fat virgin.  Yeah.  You're a big, fat virgin.  And what's your favorite station?  .5.  She said it again.  Yeah. 
[01:31:00]  You know what you're going to win now?  What?  A trip on the space shuttle.  Yeah.  The first person in space.  You're going to see Donna Summer on the space shuttle.  Isn't this fantastic?  Oh, this is wonderful.  Have you ever been on the space shuttle?  No, I haven't.  Oh, it's beautiful.  Yes.  Fantastic.  It's going to have a big disco ball.  Mm-hmm.  They're going to decorate it all.  Hey, do you know how to dial a phone?  Yeah. 
[01:31:30]  What's your favorite sexual position?  Hello?  Donna wants to know.  Hello?  Oh, no.  Is she hanging up finally?  She's gone.  Oh, my God.  It took forever.  It's Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Get a WOW sticker.  Get flashed.  Get happy.  God forbid we mention a website.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A, uncut, and live.

[01:32:30]  Now I look into you and...  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Lots going on, man.  Very excited.  The O&A Traveling Virus Comedy Tour. 
[01:33:00]  We announced the first date yesterday.  We're playing April 14th at The Joint.  Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, Las Vegas, Nevada.  They're turning over the hotel to us and our fans and the O&A Pest and all.  It's going to be very cool.  Confirmed lineup.  Jim Norton, Joe Rogan, Louis C.K., Frank Caliendo, Bob Kelly, Rich Voss, Otto and George,  Ralphie May, maybe one more comedian to be added.  But tickets go on sale Friday at 6 a.m.  Las Vegas time, 9 a.m. on the East Coast, obviously, through Ticketmaster. 
[01:33:30]  And you can get tickets pre-sale, which is not a bad idea, especially for the Pest Out West,  because this show's going to sell out.  It's a small venue.  Pre-sale tickets Thursday, 1 p.m.  Go to XtremeRadio.com.  That's the radio station we're on in Vegas.  X-T-R-E-M-E Radio.com to get your tickets in advance.  And then when we're out there, we're going to do a quick press conference to announce the rest of the cities  and some of the other comedians that are joining us this summer.  We probably could have done two shows here. 
[01:34:00]  Two shows?  Absolutely.  Oh, we still got to do a radio show.  Yeah, at some point.  Our summers are done.  We're going to be all over the place all summer long.  I wanted to do a cruise.  Ooh.  With a car, all three of us.  We're cruising.  Beeping and waving at people.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  Doug here yet?  Doug Stanhope?  Still waiting for him?  Where's that alcoholic?  He's trying to sleep.  Really?  How dependable could he be?  He's probably passed out on the cement divider. 
[01:34:30]  I'm like, the L.I. somewhere?  Yeah, something tells me he's not very dependable.  Yeah, I don't think he's up right now with his glasses on the end of his nose, perusing the times.  Hmm.  Doug Stanhope.  Look at the time.  Oh, we do have Pamela Hartman.  Yeah.  I've been saying Pamela's smart all freaking morning.  That's a different gal.  Yeah, she's in jail for murder.  Yeah.  Yeah, might as well grab her, huh?  What the hell are they doing on TV? 
[01:35:00]  She's doing like pregnant lady exercises.  Oh, boy.  You take your arms and you kind of move them, almost like you're making the umpire safe sign.  Like back and forth, back and forth, like that's going to lose a few pounds.  You're calling it EZ weight loss in 20 minutes.  Working out is not easy.  She wasn't pregnant?  No.  No.  You looked pregnant.  No.  No.  You got a pregnant woman exercise, run belly first into a brick wall.  Yeah.  Slide for home.  You'll lose weight quickly.  Jesus. 
[01:35:30]  Chris in Providence, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  Make it fast, Chris.  Let's go.  Sorry.  You guys got to destroy this Giovanni and Kim up here.  It's 92.3.  They're horrible.  They're far worse than whatever in Kelly or whatever.  Well, we got some dude from Jersey saying the bit's over.  So I guess we got to stop the bit because he knows about radio.  We don't.  Yeah, but he's from Jersey.  He's an idiot.  We're actually going to go after some tougher targets in the very near future.  I don't know about that.  We're just going after the EZ targets just to warm up a little. 
[01:36:00]  Throw a few jabs.  If you guys do keep the bit going, check it out, man.  All right.  We will.  You guys get some good material.  I think we want to go down to Pittsburgh next.  There's some crazy shows down there that are worth goofing on.  All right, Chris.  Thank you.  Thanks, Jimmy.  You rule.  Thanks, pal.  What about us?  No ruling.  Oh, boy.  We don't rule.  No ruling.  Who was the smart, the girl with the last name Smart that was kidnapped?  Who was that?  That was Elizabeth Smart.  Elizabeth Smart.  Oh, Elizabeth Smart.  But I'm thinking Pamela Smart, the hot teacher, right? 
[01:36:30]  No, Pamela Smart was...  Pamela Smart.  Yes, I think she was.  Was she the one that had sex with her?  That's right.  She hired the kid to kill her husband.  Right.  Yeah.  That's it.  Nicole Kidman played her in the movie, right?  Yep.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  This girl Pamela's racist.  Hey, there was another moment on Idol worth talking about for a couple seconds here.  Ryan Seacrest and Doug is here.  Okay, cool.  Ryan Seacrest and Simon went at it a little bit last night.  Yeah.  Well, there's a lot of rumors about Ryan Seacrest.  And all of a sudden, they...  What kind of rumors? 
[01:37:00]  That he might, you know, might play for the pink team.  Oh.  It's rumors.  Yeah.  And then when the rumors get strong, all of a sudden, like, they have a picture of him  in the gossip magazines making out with such hotties as Terry Hatcher.  Have there really been pictures of him making out with girls?  With Terry Hatcher.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Does he call them hotties?  Like they were canoodling or something.  Canoodling.  Like that would be your... 
[01:37:30]  You know, if you're that huge in Hollywood, that's who you'd go after.  Yeah.  Someone that's about 20 years past her prime.  Does he call them hotties?  He's like one of those douchebags?  Yeah, we pointed that out.  Yeah, he doesn't have the lingo down.  He doesn't have the girl lingo where, you know, the way guys talk about girls.  He gets it all wrong.  Like, it's what you would read in a textbook.  Yeah.  As soon as he said...  As soon as he used the word hottie, my eyebrow went up a little like...  Hottie.  Hottie.  That's a little weird. 
[01:38:00]  But anyway, Simon and Ryan have been kind of jabbing at each other all season, and this  was a fine exchange last night.  So, Nell wants to know, what do you consider the hardest part of this contest?  Wow.  I would have to say the high heels and these dresses.  I don't...  I like my tennis shoes and my sweatpants.  I'm sorry.  Simon, any advice on high heels?  You should know, Ryan. 
[01:38:30]  Ryan.  Stay out of my closet.  Come out.  This is about the top 12, okay?  Not your...  How great is that?  He's like, all right, you're stupid to play with Simon, first of all.  You're not going to win, you know, jabbing with Simon.  And then, obviously, Simon takes a little too far, and then all of a sudden, Ryan's like,  hey, wait a minute.  It's not about us. 
[01:39:00]  Get all pissed off.  Uh, top 12.  He started by saying, do you know anything about high heels, right?  Listen, listen to how his whole demeanor changed drastically at the end of this clip.  Come out.  This is about the top 12, okay?  Not your wishes.  We're friends.  We're friends.  That's just the pussy producers being afraid that Simon has no counterbalance, and you 
[01:39:30]  got to put him in his place.  Yeah.  He's like, someone gets him, that Mary.  All right, we just found a picture of Ryan kissing a girl.  Look at that.  It's awful.  Oh, God.  We got a picture of him trying a little too hard.  It's hard.  It's not even a girl.  It's Rod Stewart.  From his, do you think I'm sexy, Dave?  It looks like he just grabbed her.  His eyes are completely closed, and he just has his tongue stuck all the way out.  It's barely in her mouth.  Because he's so far away from her. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah.  Like, he's not committing to it.  No.  That's what you do if you want to show people that you are committing, but you're not committing  because you're, maybe this is something a little different than this hot blonde.  You could almost hear, ew, coming out of his head.  Ew.  A girl.  What?  He's feeling for whiskers.  He's holding her face, going, please, let me feel some stubble.  Please be a tranny.  Where's an Adam's apple?  Hey, let's get Doug in here. 
[01:40:30]  So that's a pretty nice exchange last night, right?  Well, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I thought you meant my apartment.  And then we got, and bring Pamela, too.  Bring sexy Pamela.  Yeah, bring Pamela.  I mean, Doug Stanhope, everyone.  We're very excited to see you, but we also want to see Pamela because she's the hot one  there.  There's Doug.  I'm still going to get this coffee in me and wake up, so I'll look at Pamela.  How you doing, man?  Hey, how are you?  Good.  How you been?  All right.  What's up, Doug?  Good to see you.  Good to see you, buddy.  Hi, Flower. 
[01:41:00]  And here's Pamela.  Sunshine.  Hi, Pamela.  Hi.  Cool, man.  Is that the friend that was in the picture with you?  Shut up.  She said shut up.  Right off the bat.  Shut up.  You said you would talk about it.  All right.  You guys are so blowing this out of proportion.  Yeah.  So silly.  So silly.  Well, let's introduce you to the new people.  Pamela Hartman was the star of MacBook Karaoke the last time we did it.  The star.  Just a short clip here.  I saw the sign, and it opened up my eyes. 
[01:41:30]  I saw the sign.  Life is demanding.  Without understanding.  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  It's all the sign.  No one's going to drag you up to get into the light where you belong.  The beauty you belong.  The sexy part.  The breathy.  Nice, right, Doug?  Life-changing.  Very nice.  Very nice.  That was life-changing?  Why?  Pretty much.  Well, the people entering this contest should know this, that be prepared for the harsh realities 
[01:42:00]  of fame.  People are going to want to know about your life.  People are going to want to try and pay you to do various things for them.  Oh.  Like what?  I don't know.  Sex?  Just say no.  Be strong.  Remain composed.  Don't let it go to your head, basically.  Wait, people have searched you out, and they want you to do some things?  I've gotten over a thousand MySpace requests.  For some awful things?  Yeah.  Pretty disgusting.  What price range were you living in?  What price range were you?  I'm just curious.  Someone said they'd give me $50 today if I plug their website. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, no, no.  No, no, no.  We want to hear about the creeps.  Yeah, there's pretty creepy, guys.  Like, give us one or two.  I don't know.  You don't have to name names, but at least tell us what they're saying to you on MySpace.  Some people are like, oh, I'm having a birthday party.  I'll give you $100 if you come sing at it.  And I'm like, no.  And some people are like, you suck so badly, I want to shove my nuts down your throat.  And I'm like, oh, goodness.  Yeah.  So they're like, you suck, but you're hot.  They're just jealous.  It's weird.  Because you won.  You're a winner. 
[01:43:00]  Basically, MacBook.  Amazing.  Endorsionate.  Call me up.  Yeah.  Love it.  All right.  And then what's up with the pictures?  What's the contest for?  A MacBook.  A Mac computer.  So just the best singer?  Well, it's not.  Not really the best.  Honestly, her and Babe Ruth in 1941.  Honestly.  I saw the sign.  Yeah.  It was the most heartfelt, I think.  Doug, if you need to know the truth, we got talked into doing like a karaoke contest.  We're like, oh, God, what are we thinking?  You know, we were just getting back to regular radio, so we couldn't say no to anything. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  But I got to be honest, it turned out to be a very cool contest because we found this one,  this lively one.  And then, Pikachu, your true treasure.  Yeah.  Well.  Thanks.  So then all of a sudden, it was brought to our attention that you had some crazy pictures.  Crazy schmazy.  It's like American Idol.  I mean, come on, guys.  No.  Those pictures are hot.  I'm 21.  I'm in college.  Yeah, okay.  I have a lot of pretty friends, and we hang out, and it's fun, but it's nothing as scandalous  as you'd like it to be.  Well, the pictures looked...  Where's Steve? 
[01:44:00]  He'll describe the pictures.  They're really not bad.  I can describe the pictures.  Do you want me to hear?  Yeah, yeah.  Basically, it was me and my friends at a party, and maybe I had a little too much to drink.  Maybe I was wearing a really short dress.  Maybe I fell on the floor.  And Ace of Base was playing in the back.  Maybe my friend was taking care of me.  Of course, obviously.  Your friend was taking care of you.  Wink, wink.  Nudge, nudge.  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  Nah.  Steve?  Steve.  You saw the pictures?  Yeah.  That's it.  It's really, like, innocent.  And it's cute.  It's fine.  It's fun.  It's cute.  We're going to move on soon, but for Steve. 
[01:44:30]  Steve.  Steve.  Were they innocent pictures, you think?  Well, innocent.  And, I mean, nah, they were...  It's not like hardcore porn.  No, no, it wasn't.  She was carrying you out like you were a six-pack of a stamp.  It wasn't hardcore at all.  It wasn't hardcore at all.  It was something that you would typically see a drunken college girl doing.  Right.  Which isn't what I'm like all the time, but, you know.  Giggling and wet in her pants.  Pretty much.  Pretty much.  Just tee-hee-hee.  Tee-hee.  Yeah.  Is those pictures not on the MySpace? 
[01:45:00]  No.  I don't even know.  I've never even seen them.  Yeah, like, where did they come from?  Who was snapping them, and who put them online?  Who ratted you out?  Someone's icky.  Yeah, someone ratted you.  Icky.  That we don't like.  Oh, really?  You know who it is?  No.  I don't know.  Oh.  But, uh, they want to talk to me.  They better watch out.  Did you reciprocate?  Reciprocate what?  Yeah.  Did you give a little back to the girl that was, uh...  She didn't do anything like that?  We saw a little bit of, um, um, like, uh, she was playing the piano. 
[01:45:30]  This is false.  She was playing the piano.  I'm a lawyer.  Can I get my lawyer?  Is that your lawyer?  Yeah.  Wasn't that the picture we saw, Steve?  Yeah.  It was, like, some, um...  There was some piano playing?  How about popping it up on the screen?  No.  We don't have it.  No.  We don't have it.  I don't know where they are.  No.  No.  Jimmy, hey.  How do we lose blood?  I think you're hot.  Thanks, but...  We don't have them.  Jimmy's attracted to you.  Let's be honest here.  How could he not?  I wouldn't have my Breathe Right strip on.  I can't hit on you with this.  Yeah.  I think it's very charming.  I was going to ask, but...  Oh, thank you.  It's quirky. 
[01:46:00]  I'm confused by this whole segment, so I'm just going to shut up.  What are you confused?  Oh, goodness.  What are you confused about, Doug?  Who she is?  Where are these pictures you're talking about?  And why she's on?  Well...  Ah.  No.  Hey.  Oh, no.  She's confused.  Not smashing.  Okay.  She won the first MacBook Karaoke contest with her.  I saw the time.  There are pictures of her that are nude, but no one knows where they are.  They're not nude.  They're not nude.  They're not nude. 
[01:46:30]  She's just kind of sitting there.  She passed out.  Yeah.  And her friend has her hand kind of up the bottom of her skirt.  Her friend seems to be having her way with her.  Her way with her.  It's really not that bad.  All right.  It's not that bad.  I mean, guys, come on.  I bet you've done that before when your girlfriend passed out.  Bob, when Jimmy does.  My girlfriend passed out like one of those arms that you put a quarter in and try to reach  down and grab a coin.  Yeah.  And I don't think any less of you for that.  I admire that.  No, we want to praise you, but you're not going with it.  And she's back now to sing another song. 
[01:47:00]  Okay.  That's all right.  Yeah.  I just wonder where we're going.  Yep.  I'll be funny in a little bit.  Don't even sweat it.  All right.  We'll do the heavy lifting.  You just get your coffee now.  By the way, this was just brought to my attention from somebody on Instant Feedback from Maine.  Anthony's quote in FHM last Thanksgiving.  Remember we did that article?  Uh-huh.  And we do these articles.  We don't even think anything of it, right?  This is your quote about comics.  Oh.  Think Richard Jenney as I read this. 
[01:47:30]  Okay.  Comics are nothing but insecure douchebags who have to go after each other.  If they take a second to think about how S.E. their own lives are, they shoot themselves  in the head.  Ah.  That's your quote from FHM last Thanksgiving.  I was actually including myself in that whole thing.  That's why it's taken out of context.  Because the guy asked a question about comics.  Yeah.  And I was kind of, you know, putting myself in that whole category. 
[01:48:00]  You know, if you step back and kind of look at yourself.  Right.  You kind of want to shoot yourself in the head sometimes, so.  Oh, there you go.  Let's say hi to John and Buffalo.  John, what's up?  I'm not as bad as, like, stand up.  What's up, guys?  They're real nice.  So why don't you tell the truth to this chick?  She's got the idea of a stone, man.  She's not stupid at all.  You know what?  She sounds stupid.  Absolutely.  But she's not.  I do?  Well, just your kind of, like, your voice.  Because you're a Long Island girl.  You have, like, the accent.  Oh.  And just how you did.  I saw the swine and all that.  Yeah. 
[01:48:30]  Hey, what's this guy's name?  Uh, well, we hung up on him.  Oh, well, guy listening.  I'm not stupid, by the way.  Yeah, he's not.  Uh, he.  She's not stupid.  I'm quite intelligent, actually.  You have nice feet, by the way.  I'm not a foot guy, but her toes.  Can you see her toes?  Thanks.  They're red.  My mom did it last night.  Do you have nice feet?  Because I can only see the two.  They're all kind of crammed in.  They're okay.  I don't know.  I'm waiting for Oscar Schindler to throw water on them.  All right, are you ready to kick off MacBook Karaoke for everybody?  I don't really know.  I guess so.  All right, we got to, you want to sing Like a Virgin?  Yeah, it's a good choice, right? 
[01:49:00]  Okay, and, uh, we do it in our style, basically.  She's going to hear the music.  No one else is going to.  Okay.  And she's got the headphones on, so she'll be really feeling the music.  All right, here's, uh, Pamela Hartman.  What's your MySpace account again?  I don't know.  It's not, it's...  You don't want to give it out anymore, do you?  It's just numbers.  I had to make it, I had to switch it to private.  I had to make it so I could approve all comments.  Oh, that's not bad, huh?  Out of hand.  Yeah.  Welcome to our nightmare. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah.  All right, here's Pamela.  Okay, this is going to be interesting, just to warn you.  Just get into it.  You hear it?  Okay.  Do you need it louder or anything?  It's a good song.  Make sure it's turned up so she really, like, yells.  Okay.  She's hearing the music, we're not.  Okay.  I made it through the wilderness, and I found you.  I was beat and complete. 
[01:50:00]  I've been hurt.  I was sad and blue.  But you made me feel, yeah, you made me feel shiny and new.  You, like a virgin, touched for the very first time, time, time, like a virgin. 
[01:50:30]  When your heart beats next to mine, gonna give you all my love, boy.  My fear is fading fast.  Been saving it all for you, cause only love can last.  You're so fine, and you're mine.  Make me strong, yeah, you make me bold.  All your love thawed out. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah, your love thawed out, what was scared and cold, like a virgin, touched for the very  first time, like a virgin, with your heartbeat next to mine.  Ooh, ah, ah, ah. 
[01:51:30]  Ooh, ah, ah, ah, ah.  You're so fine, and you're mine.  I'll be yours, till the end of time.  Cause you made me feel  Yeah, you made me feel  I've nothing to hide 
[01:52:00]  Like a virgin  Touched for the first time  Like a virgin  When your heart beats  Next to mine, it feels so good  Inside  When you hold me  And your heart beats  And you love me  Woo!

And I went into his bathroom,  and he had aquafresh toothpaste.  And I smoothed a dollop of aquafresh toothpaste  into my asshole.  Dude, that had to be the worst pain you've ever felt.  It was cool and refreshing for about a minute,  and I walked outside,  and a fucking blowtorch in my asshole.  I ran back in and had to wipe aquafresh  out of my fucking tender anus. 
[02:41:30]  Live and learn.  Because toothpaste is fucked up.  My brother told me once,  he goes,  take some Ultra Bright.  There's some Ultra Bright in my father's bathroom.  He goes,  take some Ultra Bright and just wipe it on your cheek.  And I was like,  oh, okay.  He's my older brother.  So I wipe it on my cheek.  He goes,  now just wait.  And I'm waiting, waiting,  and all of a sudden,  I swear,  it felt like someone held a lighter up to my cheek  and was burning.  And he starts laughing.  I go,  no, it hurts, it hurts.  He goes,  okay,  just rinse it off with cold water.  So I grabbed cold water, 
[02:42:00]  and it was the worst thing I could have done.  It hurts so fucking bad.  Ultra Bright.  Yeah,  Ultra Bright toothpaste.  Remember that one, kids,  for your younger brothers.  Let's go to Iowa.  Ow, what's up?  That was before,  no,  that was after he,  as I was sleeping,  he caught a bunch of moths in a jar  and shoved them down the back of my underwear.  Who did?  And when I woke up,  my brother,  I had an underwear full of moths.  Well,  that's why I don't like moths.  Because he had watched the cartoon  and saw moths eat through clothes.  So he wanted to see that. 
[02:42:30]  So he caught moths  and threw them down my underwear  and waited to see them eat through my underwear.  Did you freak out with moths  by your hiney hole?  Yeah,  I was like,  you know,  I think I was like five  or something like that.  I couldn't understand  why there were moths in my underwear.  Hey,  we got two great calls coming in.  Let's go to Scott and Westchester.  Scott,  what's up?  Hey,  what's up,  guys?  How you doing?  Hey.  Yeah,  me and my girl,  one time,  we tried to icy hot.  We were just really a little drunk  and she wanted to have an anal. 
[02:43:00]  So we tried that  and it was like a second.  It was great.  And then  about a minute later,  the both of us  were running for the shower,  which is a big no-no,  obviously,  because that just makes it  twice as worse.  Yeah,  that's the kind of shit  you do on Coke  when you can't feel anything anyway.  You just need to feel something  and you go,  all right,  yeah,  icy hot.  Make it hurt.  Make it hurt.  Yeah,  there were some  outside influences  that definitely  led to a bad decision.  With Coke,  you get acorn dick,  but the second  it gets fucking hard, 
[02:43:30]  it ain't going away  for a year.  You will fuck forever.  But,  you know,  to get the ball rolling  takes a while.  The ped date is...  Especially when you're looking  for cops out the window  every time you fuck.  What the fuck was that sound?  The ped date is saying  kids' stories.  All right,  I guess these are kids' stories.  Al in Iowa,  what's up?  I have a vasectomy  go a little bad  night of the procedure.  Blood started leaking  into my nut bag,  and I ended up 
[02:44:00]  with a bruise  like from mid-thigh  to mid-abdomen.  My nut bag  was about grapefruit size.  Filled with blood?  Yeah,  filled with blood,  which of course  coagulated  and made me  very aware of gravity.  Oh,  fuck.  Yeah,  dude,  it was rough.  You couldn't just  jerk it out?  I didn't jerk off it.  Eight days  before I blew a load,  because I was afraid  of what would come out.  You don't want to see 
[02:44:30]  a guy through a blood  or chili or something  come out of your dick,  because you'd never  fuck again.  No jerk of chili?  Whatever,  you don't know  when your balls  are that size.  You don't know  what's coming out.  It's going to come  flying out of there  and scare the shit  out of you.  Well,  once the stitches  dissolved,  I was able to  get in a nice  hot shower  and let some  of that coagulated  blood kind of  soften up  and I could  fucking squeeze  it out of the  incision.  Fucking  fucking  space food.  Like a ketchup  packet.  Why don't you  just fucking  do the easy thing? 
[02:45:00]  Just fuck for a second  and he's just  knock him up  and put on  your Doc Martens.  Whack.  All right, Al.  All right, later.  Thank you, sir.  Let's say  how to AJ  in Jersey.  AJ.  Yo.  Good evening.  How are you guys  doing?  All right, AJ.  Very good, yo.  Guys, I listen  to you all the time.  You are my  favorite talk show  ever.  Oh.  Aw.  You like the  ball talk,  do you? 
[02:45:30]  Can you  click and  clack talk  balls?  Can you start  a message board  and then,  I don't know,  three years  from now,  we'll hate  you?  Thanks, AJ.  I appreciate  it.  Thanks, guys.  I guess that's  all I want to  say.  All right, Pamela,  we're going to  go to break  with, uh,  we haven't  played this one  yet.  You sent in  another song?  Oh, yeah.  I heard you  guys weren't  impressed by it,  though, so that's  why you didn't  play it.  Which one?  Wannabe?  Spice Girls.  I haven't heard  it.  I haven't heard  it.  Well, you  weren't impressed  by it.  Maybe the staff.  Oh, boy.  Steve, I'm not  impressed by it. 
[02:46:00]  I don't, I  didn't like it.  You probably  liked the original  better.  Steve, you  weren't impressed  with Wannabe  by the Spice Girls  they're talking  about?  What seems to be  the problem with  her audition?  I felt that she  was hamming it up  a bit with the  Spice Girls one.  Are you hamming  this up?  Because some  people are  accusing you.  We don't think  you are.  What people are  trying to peg me  as, because it's  just me, like,  having fun,  singing the way  I would just  sing around the  house.  Right.  I'm not trying  to be anything  I'm not.  I'm not doing  anything that I  can't do.  We know she's  not, because 
[02:46:30]  she sent in  I Saw the Sign  to win a MacBook  and no one knew  that we were  looking for the  really bad ones.  Yeah.  She really thought  she was doing  a good job.  Yeah, the original  songs are really  bad, so no matter  what, how you  screw it up, like,  I wouldn't listen  to any of these  songs if they  came on my car  radio, I'd kick  the fucking knob  off of it.  Yeah, you're pretty  kidding.  It's just me  having a good time.  Yeah, well, you  ruining it is no  different.  Let them call me  what they want.  I know the truth.  Well, they're  calling me a few  things today.  Steve, do you  want to help us out?  Such as?  I didn't say anything.  Well, there's one  on line four. 
[02:47:00]  Wait, you ruined  Ace of Base.  How?  Yes, yeah.  I don't know.  You don't care  what they call you?  What?  Not really.  I mean, should I?  All right.  Jackie in Jersey.  Jackie.  Guys, I've been  listening to you  since NEW.  I never asked you  for anything, but  please do me this.  Get this annoying  fucking cunt off the  radio, please.  Oh, boy.  So, annoying fucking  cunt is one thing  they're calling you.  That is kind of mean.  That's really mean,  but you don't care,  right, what people say?  I mean, why?  I mean, do you care  what people say  about you?  Sometimes it hurts 
[02:47:30]  a little, yeah.  It doesn't really.  It does.  But I don't sting.  I know that I'm  not those things,  but it bothers me  that, yeah,  why do you think that?  I'm an annoying cunt.  What do you mean  she's not those things?  She's 100% those things.  Why?  Why are you  an annoying cunt?  I don't know.  That's the way  you were born?  Maybe because no one  knows how to shut  the fuck up?  Maybe because your  good-looking guys  don't tell you,  hey, you're annoying.  I don't know what it is.  I'm pretty much  not annoying, so  if you have a problem  with where I was born,  I guess call my mom.  I don't know.  I mean, open up  the phone lines,  say how many people  say she's annoying,  how many people  say she's not. 
[02:48:00]  I mean, I guarantee you  95% she's an annoying twop.  It could be a nice  little game we play  after the break.  Right.  Is she annoying?  Is she not annoying?  I would say do a  poll on Whackbag,  but are you too many  polls as it is?  Oh, enough of the polls.  All right.  Thank you, Jackie.  Thank you, guys.  I think she's a nice girl.  Let's go to Jamie  from Fort Drum.  We like Pamela.  She's a good girl.  Jamie, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I got a pretty  vicious story, too.  I went camping  with a buddy,  and when he wanted off,  I decided it was time  to take a little time 
[02:48:30]  for myself.  You know what I mean?  And we were out  in the woods.  It was the summertime,  and I forgot that  I had bug spray on.  That shit made my dick  shriveled and dry  and cracked  like you have never  imagined in your life.  But you had bug spray  on your hands, I guess,  and then you backed off?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I thought you had  bug spray on your penis.  I'm like, what?  Was there a Skeeter  on your Peter?  Knock it off. 
[02:49:00]  All right.  Thank you, Jamie.  All right, let's try  this wannabe song  because now we made it  into something.  Now more people  can try and kill me.  It's Pamela Hartman.  She sent this in a while ago.  It's the Spice Girls  wannabe, right?  You hear the music  or is it just you?  I think there's music.  Oh, boy.  I don't know.  Here's Pamela.  You see what I want,  what I really, really want.  So tell me what you want,  what you really, really want.  I want to, huh.  I want what I really, really want.  So tell me what you want,  what you really, really want. 
[02:49:30]  I want to, huh, huh, huh, huh.  I want to really, really, really want.  Sick, sick, ah.  If you want my future,  forget my past.  If you want to get with me,  I better make it biggest.  Now don't go wasting  my precious time.  Get your act together.  We could be just fine.  I'll tell you what I want,  what I really, really want.  So tell me what you want,  what you really, really want.  I want to, huh, huh, huh, huh.  I want to really, really, really want. 
[02:50:00]  Sick, sick, ah.  If you want to be my lover,  you got to get with my friend.  Making life forever.  Friendship never ends.  If you want to be my lover,  you have got to give.  Sick, it is too easy,  but that's the way it is.  So what you think about that?  Now you know how I feel.  Say you can handle my love.  Are you for, are you for me?  I won't be hasty.  I'll give you a try. 
[02:50:30]  If you really buck me,  then I'll say goodbye.  You will tell me what I want,  what I really, really want.  So tell me what you want,  what you really, really want.  I want to, huh, huh, huh, huh.  I want to really, really, really want.  Sick, sick, ah.  If you want to be my lover,  you got to get with my friends.  Make it last forever.  Friendship never ends.  If you want to be my lover,  you have got to give.  Sickin' is too easy,  but that's the way it is. 
[02:51:00]  So here's the story from A to Z.  You want to get with me,  you've got to listen carefully.  You got Opie in the place,  who likes it in your face.  You got to the if and he likes it.  Little Jimmy doesn't come for free.  He's a real lady,  and ask for me.  Aha, you'll see.  Slim your body down and wind it all around.  Slim your body down and wind it all around.  If you want to be my lover,  you got to get with my friends.  Make it last forever.  Friendship never ends.  If you want to be my lover, 
[02:51:30]  you have got to give.  Sickin' is too easy,  but that's the way it is.  If you want to be my lover,  you gotta, you gotta, you gotta,  you gotta, you gotta make it last forever.  Slim your body down and wind it all around.  Slim your body down and wind it all around.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Slim your body down and wind it all around.  Slim your body down and zigzag.  If you want to be my lover, lover, lover, lover. 
[02:52:00]  Okay, terrific.  Wow.  Wow.  How extensive is this catalog of songs that you have to choose from?  Are there going to be more?  Doug really, really hates this.  He can't even fake it.  I don't hate it.  I have to say, listening to it, I'm like, oh, that is pretty annoying.  I understand. 
[02:52:30]  Not pleasant on the ears.  Well, there's a guy, let me see.  Just a nice call of it.  Yeah, a couple of clips of it.  Chase from Atlanta.  Hearing her sing Wannabe made me want to jizz in her mouth.  Ah.  But then he writes, that is a compliment.  Oh, thank you.  Okay, so people like that.  And then you got Pauly from Florida.  This bitch killed my sea monkeys.  Aw.  That's tragic and unfortunate.  Wow.  There's a lot of, well, feedback coming in. 
[02:53:00]  So I guess you got to talk to the fans next.  I guess so.  And you don't care what they say about you, right?  I can handle it.  Don't say that on this show, please.  I can handle it, trust me.  You can handle it.  I believe so.  I don't know.  Try me.  All right, we'll try you next.  All right.  Also, Jeff Goldblum is calling the show today.  Hmm.  In about a half hour, right?  One of our favoritest clips ever comes from Jeff Goldblum.  And this is it. 
[02:53:30]  Goddamn rich cunt.  I kill rich cunt.  What's that from?  Independence Day.  That is from Death Wish.  Oh, all right.  He played one of the young thugs in Death Wish.  That killed his wife and daughter, right?  Paul Kersey.  I love when you watch old clips from the 70s and you see guys that are famous now and they're  just like a busboy or something.  Wow, look at that.  Yeah.  Any plugs, Doug, as we go to break? 
[02:54:00]  How about that diner again?  That was a good plug.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  Metro Diner in Warren, Rhode Island.  It's my brother's diner.  He needs business.  How about that?  Down there.  Get a burger.  I'm in Rhode Island next week doing a gig.  How far is that from Providence, Rhode Island?  It's real close.  My brother will come pick you up.  All right.  We got more to go.  Stay there.  Huzzah!  I got to cast a spell on you.  I'll run ye through. 
[02:54:30]  Four damage.  You're not even double dual wielding.  Plastic sword.  Two damage.  Two damage.  I cast a spell.  Bam with my bean bag.  I just cast a spell.  You've slowed me.

[02:56:00]  The hot seat?  The hot seat.  What will that entail?  Hey, can we get a sign that says hot seat with an arrow that points down?  Whoa.  Yeah, yeah.  That's wacky.  In red, of course.  In red, yeah.  If it's not in red, someone has to be fired today.  Want to acknowledge the people that did the walkover with us today.  Yeah, who are they?  I don't know.  I know that kid babbled the whole way.  Something about college radio.  I don't know.  I felt so bad for, oh, like, I'm walking and I'm saying, like, 
[02:56:30]  oh, my God, we just talked for three hours.  How are you escaping?  Because I put my head down and just fucking walk.  And I go, we just talked for three hours straight.  And this walkover is like a five-minute break where you could just breathe and not have  to think or talk.  You just walk.  To coffee, yeah.  And it's like, I look at people.  I kind of, my head's down.  And I'm just walking.  I don't have to think about what I'm going to say.  I don't have to talk.  I don't have to listen to people.  I could just talk. 
[02:57:00]  And all I hear behind me is this kid talking to Opie.  And I'm just thinking, poor fucking Opie just wants to not talk or think for five minutes.  Oh, I wasn't going to sacrifice my, what am I, throwing myself on the fucking grenade?  As you're thinking, poor Opie.  Poor Opie, I noticed that you didn't even attempt to help me.  Fuck, no.  All you have to do is do like, oh, but I got to talk to you about something.  And then I go, oh, excuse me.  That would entail me talking.  But then I run up to you and then we would walk in silence together.  You can help me out every once in a while.  So the Jersey guy, he does a radio show, I guess. 
[02:57:30]  I want you to know what he was doing.  Hold on.  I'm going to give him a plug.  Look how red his face has gotten.  He's on WBUQ.  The Revolution.  The Revolution.  Why are you guys called The Revolution?  I have no idea why we're calling The Revolution.  Our radio show, actually, it's a piece of shit station.  I'm not going to lie.  All right.  It sucks.  Well, you've got to start somewhere.  I know, but, you know.  You know.  I don't know.  It's a piece of shit radio station.  I started on the Voice of the Valley and Jimmy started on, you know, W on EW.  But now look at you guys. 
[02:58:00]  I mean.  You're in a freaking castle now.  Now look.  Yeah, I started on the Voice of the Valley.  Anthony started on VAB.  You know, you've got to start somewhere.  You've got to start somewhere.  I talked to farmers and Jimmy talked to Manhattan, you know.  I talked to a prison.  Only people that call on my radio show are guys from the prison that are down the street.  Yeah.  That's it.  I swear to God.  What's the name of your show?  It's called The Rich and Howie Radio Show.  Really original.  Yeah.  And is it a music show?  No.  We talk about stupid shit like you guys. 
[02:58:30]  Random stuff.  We make fun of everybody on campus and everything.  Calling us stupid shit?  We're getting stuff done with this show.  You know that, right?  You guys get a lot of stuff done.  I'm not going to lie.  Oh.  All right.  Stop kissing ass.  Now, Oklahoma City to your right.  Oh.  I said hi to them, too.  You guys are up.  You're not a fan of the show.  No, I am.  Sort of, though.  I don't want to be on the radio.  No, you're sort of not a fan.  I'm trying to move away from the mic.  She's freaking out.  You're sort of not a fan, though.  I am.  I like y'all.  I've learned how to read people.  We get, like, a studio audience every day, and I stare at every one of you, and I could 
[02:59:00]  tell who the fan is and who's been dragged up here because the boyfriend is the fan.  Last time I was on with you guys, you were live from Philly, and there was a fat girl  that was not a fan, necessarily.  Yes.  And Norton starts railing on her for being a big, fat pig when she's out in the live audience,  and she left crying, and she made the guy get rid of...  You're going to take the XM radio out of the house right now?  Yeah.  She was pissed off at her boyfriend, her husband, or whatever it was. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah, she was a fucking...  She was a sea animal.  But you guys, you're visiting New York?  Uh-huh.  And she's married to Edward Norton from American History X?  Ah, good boy.  He looks like him.  You're the big fan, though, right?  She's kind of a fan.  Yeah, she is.  I mean, we both are, but...  Oh, wow.  That's cool.  How long have you been listening to us since you got the XM?  No, like two years.  XM, yeah.  Oh, wow.  Oh, that's cool.  We like meeting the newer fans.  And what are you doing in New York?  Shopping, hanging out.  Yeah. 
[03:00:00]  Have you seen anything cool?  What's up?  Have you seen anything cool in New York?  Y'all?  Huh?  You guys?  Aw.  Y'all.  But you haven't seen a homeless guy take a dump or anything yet?  Do what?  A homeless guy take a dump?  No.  Hey, have you seen a Negro?  Yes.  Aren't they fascinating?  Oklahoma City.  Our Negroes are a little different than your Negroes.  Yeah.  No, they're like, no, they're all the same. 
[03:00:30]  All right.  We'll let you be.  She's nervous.  Yeah.  That's fine.  In Oklahoma, they're separate but equal.  Right.  Exactly.  All right.  Do you want to put Pamela in the hot seat?  Yeah.  We got the hot seat sign?  What is that?  Oh, here comes the actual hot seat.  Oh, it's hot.  It looks hot.  There it is.  Hot seat.  Who wrote that?  Pat Duffy.  What?  Pat Duffy?  Yeah.  All right.  Get some.  That's good.  Like a fucking five-year-old penmanship.  Did he put the pen in his teeth and fucking...  Yeah.  It's horrible.  Yes. 
[03:01:00]  All right.  No one's going to see it anyway.  It's fucking radio.  I know.  That was the point.  We're just kidding.  No, there she is.  Sitting.  Burning.  She smells good.  Burning.  Are you ready?  I'm ready.  Bring it on.  You said you could take anything, right?  I believe so.  And I'm not even screening these.  It could be a good comment.  It could be a bad one.  All right?  Mm-hmm.  Let's see what you could take.  Number one.  Rob in Virginia.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  Look, I just want to say, Pamela, you're beautiful, but I haven't heard a Jew scream like 
[03:01:30]  that since Auschwitz.  That's pretty funny.  I like you, Rob.  I like you.  Nothing there?  It was good.  I like it.  I can handle it.  All right.  You can handle it.  Thanks, Rob.  Jason in Pennsylvania.  Jason?  Yeah, I don't think you're annoying.  I think when you were saying I want to be strong, your type of broad, I'd like to bang  just to make you feel the noise that you do.  Do you have the right moves required?  All right.  Why don't you come over and find out? 
[03:02:00]  Oh, goodness.  Smooth talk, sir.  Yeah.  Wow.  This sounds like a lim-a-date.  I'll try a few more.  I'm like, why don't you come over here and I'll show you.  Yeah.  Makes me want to.  Let's go to Scott the trucker.  Scott.  Hello, boys.  How are you doing?  Good.  Pamela, I enjoy you.  You have a great voice and I think you just sound like a fun girl.  Oh.  You're having a good time singing.  Thanks.  I'm glad you like it.  How's your truck? 
[03:02:30]  You're kind of quick-witted.  Would you go out with the trucker?  I don't know.  It depends how big the truck is.  How big is your cock, sir?  It's not as big as my truck.  Oh.  I guess this is over then.  It's a normal average size.  What do you mean?  I don't know.  You got a boyfriend?  No.  No?  Girlfriend?  No, I don't.  What was the last boyfriend you had?  Yeah.  Oops.  The trucker I'm asking.  What was the last boyfriend you had?  Did I slip out?  November.  November?  Yeah.  What happened?  We're still friends. 
[03:03:00]  Singing in the shower.  There's potential.  Wow.  There's potential.  Still friends?  Yeah.  All right.  This is horrible.  I'd like to go out for a nice dinner with her.  You have a fun dinner date.  Would you go out with Jimmy?  I have a girlfriend.  I can't.  Yeah.  I wouldn't do that to her.  His girlfriend.  Well, without boyfriend or girlfriend type thing,  would you ever go out?  As friends?  Of course.  Would you be the first one that Jimmy goes out with  after he breaks up with his girlfriend?  Rebound?  Totally.  You'd be a rebound chick, Jimmy.  As rebound?  What do you think?  I'm always down for me.  We can just go out as friends. 
[03:03:30]  We don't have to fool out.  Yeah, totally.  I mean, it's friends.  It's not even cheating.  Like, if you jerk each other off,  but you look straight ahead.  Right.  You pretend it's not happening.  Yeah.  Like a molestation.  And there won't be that awkwardness.  Like, you know?  It'll be good.  We'll just use a little Purell if we're finished.  Totally.  I love it.  All right, let's go to Coke Logic.  This bit's going nowhere,  but we'll give it a couple more tries here.  Coke Logic.  Coke Logic, what's up?  Hey, Richard Jennings sounds better in the shower  than this cunt.  Oh, snap.  That's harsh. 
[03:04:00]  She's fucking amming it up.  It was just the first time.  She sent in a little fucking song.  Now she's just like the kid who falls down,  makes the parents laugh.  Now they keep falling down.  Oh, it's funny.  It's funny.  Now you find out he has muscular dystrophy.  Are you guys producing these songs for it?  Or do you just go, hey, sing another one?  Or do you bring these to yourself?  No, they're like, hey, you want to sing a song?  And I'm like, all right.  All right, so you don't have, like,  all these songs already recorded  and you're shopping them around at flea markets or something.  No.  You just does them.  All right.  Let's say hi to Ben in New York. 
[03:04:30]  Ben, what's up?  Hi, guys.  What's up?  Turn down your radio if you're calling the show.  What's up?  Nothing.  I just want to tell Pamela  that she probably sounds better  with a cock in her mouth  than singing this bullshit.  Oh, goodness.  Cock in your mouth, would you sound better?  No?  I don't know.  I don't think I'd really sound like anything.  Pro or con as far as cock in the mouth.  Cock in the mouth, like it.  Don't like it.  Indifferent.  That's my favorite kind of head, indifferent.  She gives some indifferent head, man. 
[03:05:00]  I could be blowing you or walking the subway.  It doesn't matter.  And who's your friend out there?  That's Stephanie.  She's cute, right?  She's got a lovely rack, Stephanie.  She does.  She's my friend from school.  Are they from Long Island as well?  Are you the one in the pictures?  No, there's no pictures.  Oh, yeah.  I forgot about pictures.  Long Islanders aren't allowed to make friends  anywhere else but Long Island.  Oh, that's not true.  Yeah.  I hear that you guys, like, I don't know, sing together sometimes?  You do karaoke? 
[03:05:30]  Stephanie actually can sing very well.  But you guys sing together, right?  Sometimes, yeah.  Why are you saying what?  Do you sing?  Is it true you guys do duets?  We have on occasion.  Like what?  What song?  What are we saying?  Spice Girls, I think.  No.  Hold on.  We're trying to get her a microphone.  What are you trying to do?  Good Christ, Barry Gordy.  Will you stop trying to produce more of this?  Hotown.  E-Rock gave me some intel. 
[03:06:00]  I'm afraid to, like, leave this place.  People are going to throw shit at me.  All right.  What have you sung with her?  Spice Girls.  We know enough about the Spice Girls.  They're looking for you.  We haven't really sang anything else.  I can picture the two of you in a pink room with a lot of ruffles and singing into hair  brushes together.  Yeah.  That's as crazy as the night ever gets.  Making your YouTube video.  Basically.  Typical.  E-Rock, what do they sing?  I was told they sing Cheap Trick, I Want You to Want Me. 
[03:06:30]  Oh.  Oh.  We both like that song.  Yeah, we do.  We both sang it at karaoke before.  We did?  Separate time.  Oh.  Separately.  Good time.  I don't recall.  Good time.  Yes.  There's five guitars.  Rick Nelson.  Yeah, of course.  It's a classic, I suppose.  How long have you been friends?  With your kids?  Since college started.  Freshman year.  Have you guys ever made out?  No.  I don't think so.  Drunk.  A little.  I don't think so.  Guys, we used to live together.  We did.  We used to live together.  Well, what's the I don't think so? 
[03:07:00]  Thank you, Doug.  I almost missed that.  I don't think so.  Because like in a drunk thing, it might have happened once.  Yeah, but guys, no.  Guys would never.  Yeah, imagine in a drunk thing.  I'm not sure if I'm Norton.  Have we ever made out?  I don't think so.  I don't know, but there's never that mild.  Guys and girls are so fucking different.  It's because girls are more attractive than guys in general, so it's easier to kiss a girl.  Fair enough.  So if you say I don't think so, that means you probably did.  Maybe.  Everyone is nodding.  If it makes you sleep better at night, we can say okay.  I guess.  Just drunken, you know. 
[03:07:30]  Mystery no one's going to try to solve.  No.  No one cares.  No one cares.  This is a mystery.  We will try to solve.  Do you have big areolas?  Do you have big areolas?  Because you have larger breasts.  No.  Oh, you got the tiny nips?  I can't.  I'm going to detail.  Why?  It's only breasts.  It's harmless.  It's not dirty.  Can we see yours?  Who?  Jimmy's.  I'll show you my hog.  Yeah, I don't give a fuck.  Jimmy.  Do it.  See, you can't challenge Jimmy to anything.  Nah, he'll just accept it. 
[03:08:00]  We don't like the phoniness.  Like, Jimmy will show you his hog.  You can hold his hog.  Oh, goodness.  You can slap it.  You can slap it and mock its size when compared with a black.  You want to make believe you're not holding it?  It's preferable if you slap it and mock it.  Huh?  No.  She's like, ah, so, can we move on from this?  Like, I'm afraid to leave this building.  I'm afraid I'm going to walk down the street and people are going to throw things at me and  and be like, shut up, bitch.  No one cares that much.  All right. 
[03:08:30]  Thanks.  I wouldn't worry.  They won't bother you.  Opie's like, I don't know.  Does she have good, uh...  Opie, I think you're sexy.  Oh.  Oh, thank you.  I just wanted to tell you.  That's very nice.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Why is it always Opie, though?  There's other people in the studio.  You're sexy, too.  Stop.  That's not good enough.  Hears.  Jimmy, she said you're sexy, too.  I think Anthony's wicked a lot.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, thank you, Doug.  Did we kiss?  I can't remember.  I'm not really sure.  I've been going through my memory all morning.  I remember being drunk with you once.  You were in a tree fort in California in 1964. 
[03:09:00]  64?  Did you have me tied to a crucifix  and whacking my dick with a riding crop?  I don't remember.  Something's ringing a bell, but...  Yeah.  We were drunk.  Yeah.  You don't know.  Not sure.  Crazy things happen.  A couple of Bartles and James.  Everything goes screwy.  We were thinking of having these two sing,  but I don't think it's...  Nah.  I think I'm retiring.  I have a good idea.  You're retiring?  I'm retiring.  Wow.  My karaoke days are over.  We got your last performance on tape.  It hurts my vocal cords. 
[03:09:30]  You're really retiring?  Yeah, I think so.  It's a shame this is your last appearance on this show.  Yeah.  Well, you two bare knuckle fight.  Don't cry about it.  I don't know about that.  How about...  I love her too much to fight her.  How about jello wrestling?  I don't think so.  I'm allergic to jello.  We need a new bit for you if you're retiring the bad singer.  Oh, do you?  How about...  Will you wrestle an ultra bright for us?  How about guess how many fingers Doug...  Oh, no. 
[03:10:00]  What do you do?  Like, what do you do?  In life?  Yeah.  I'm a student.  You're a student.  What was your weekend like?  Yeah.  Yeah, like what do you do for fun?  For fun?  You seem like a...  I'll be honest with you.  You seem like a dull person.  Like, like...  No, no.  The singing is not...  I don't mean that as an insult.  Listen to me.  I can hear TJ Maxx like mocking clothes.  I've never heard anyone say that to me.  I don't mean that as an insult.  I'm just saying, from hearing you talk and everything, you're very soft-spoken. 
[03:10:30]  It's like, yeah, okay.  So you come off, and I could be completely wrong, as a dull person.  I want to know what you do.  Like, what is your weekend like?  I think that's crazy.  I think I'm an exciting and vibrant person.  I don't know.  See?  I love...  You look like brick hair.  Sell it right there.  You're like, what?  20, 22?  All right, yeah.  So most people are really dull at that age.  I disagree.  Oh, she's looking down at you.  She did look down.  She looked down at you.  I just think I have a great time. 
[03:11:00]  I have great friends.  You probably don't find yourself dull, but once you're our age, and you've done the  shit we've done, you can't...  As exciting as you might be...  He did blow with his mother.  Okay.  I'm not saying you're dull.  I can't hang out.  Just to watch her die.  I like a chick that has, like, horror stories and baggage.  I like those tired old whores.  Tired old whores.  Because they're interesting.  There you go.  You know?  I've got plenty of war stories.  And I'm just going to step out into the real world. 
[03:11:30]  But no, I guess I am sort of trying to find myself.  I'm in my early 20s, post-adolescent.  I didn't want to see a phase.  How old were you when you lost your virginity?  Oh, very young.  How old?  Very young.  Quite young.  13?  No.  That's really young.  16?  You're close.  15.  How old was I?  But anyway, does this make me like dull, if you know, when I'm looking at you?  Yeah, it would.  It's obviously 15.  How old was I?  But the fact that you're embarrassed about just a simple question is kind of proving my point.  I'm not embarrassed.  I just feel like, what does it matter? 
[03:12:00]  Like, why would that even be, except me be afraid to answer?  Yeah.  I'm not afraid.  It's just like, I don't understand.  Because I'm a pervert.  Yeah, who was it?  It was an older guy.  Yeah.  How much older?  Not much older.  Okay.  All right.  Well, high school.  Ah, that's cute.  No.  You were 40.  Some guy in a bookmobile with a fucking hammer.  But I really want to prove that I'm not dull.  You've got to show us you're a little wild.  Yeah, yeah.  Because I'm not getting that from you. 
[03:12:30]  When you sing, I kind of get like, you know, you're a little wild and wacky and stuff.  Look at my mind.  She is wild.  I can vouch for it.  But what do you do?  I have a good time.  She's in the life of the party.  She's wacky and fun and crazy.  And she likes to dance.  What do you enjoy?  I love music.  You go out dancing.  I'm like a music nerd.  Okay, you dance.  I DJ, like parties.  All right, wait a minute.  I DJed her party.  Who cares?  There's something going on with these two.  What?  She's smiling way too much.  You're smitten with it.  I just like to smile.  We're good friends.  But you're smitten with her.  We can tell.  Something's going on.  I'm happy for her.  You like girls, right? 
[03:13:00]  No.  A little bit?  No.  A little bit.  Come on.  No.  Yeah, a little bit.  No.  What do you guys make out?  No.  How about like a friend kiss?  No.  A friend kiss.  That would be exciting.  Jimmy and I do friend kiss.  What were we doing yesterday?  We did kissy time.  Not tonight.  Yeah, we did.  We have a new bit called Kissy Time.  Kissy Time with Greg and Jimmy.  With Greg and Jimmy.  I used my real name and everything, so it wasn't a big deal.  I'd be much happier if you guys did it.  We did it yesterday.  It's your turn.  I missed it.  Repeat.  Kissy Time.  It's Kissy Time.  I missed it.  Kissy Time is all I have.  What's with guys and loving the girls making out together? 
[03:13:30]  Why does it excite you so much?  How about just no time, just lip to lip?  Give us something today.  Show us you're a little wild.  How about a peck?  Like a little peck is done.  I'm wild in many other ways.  I don't need to kiss her.  What other way?  What other way?  Carjack people?  What are you doing?  I killed a man last week.  No, I don't know.  What's crazy?  Yeah, what do you do that's crazy?  A little wild.  What do we do that's crazy?  You work for some rip-off escort service where you go in and you go, 
[03:14:00]  oh, my driver needs the money now, and then you go right through his wallet,  you shrug him and cut out a kidney and go, I can't believe I did that.  I guess I am pretty innocent.  I mean, I don't do that, so I don't know.  Do you have...  But I wouldn't say dull is the problem.  Well, Pamela, do you understand what's going on?  We're trying to find a new bitch for you so you have a life on the show.  Yeah, so we're trying to get your personality, but I'm not getting anything.  Do you have any shame in your life?  What are you ashamed of?  Like, dang, when you've been up doing narcotics for three days and then you get that hangover 
[03:14:30]  where your serotonin dips so badly and you'll just cry openly.  What's that one thing?  I'm sorry that that happened to you.  Happened.  It's an ongoing process.  Life's a series of ups and downs.  Right.  Doug loves his drugs.  Not as much.  Alcohol, mostly.  I'm with you on that, actually.  Do you have any shame at all?  What drugs are you doing?  I have an alcohol problem.  Anything you're ashamed of that you've done?  Oh, okay.  That's exciting.  Do you have an alcohol problem?  Like, I think most college students do, by the way.  All right.  You're kissing girls. 
[03:15:00]  Is it because you drink too much or you get drunk real easy?  Both.  Oh, really?  Which is a bad combination.  You're like a cheap date, they call it.  Great dinner combination.  All right.  Let's ask young Sam.  Does she kiss girls or what?  He's just out of college.  He's fresh-faced.  He has a head full of cotton candy.  Have you seen girls like this?  She kisses girls.  No doubt, right?  No.  She gets a little drunk.  Yeah, but it's in that bi-trendy, just-for-attention way.  It's not like...  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  It's not hardcore.  Yeah, sort of.  It's not hardcore.  No.  There's no deep kissing.  No deep kissing. 
[03:15:30]  A girl was obviously, you know, you were drinking and a girl was touching you in a certain  way.  I mean, we've seen that.  That's not true.  But we saw it.  I agree.  I know.  But even though it didn't happen and there aren't pictures, we did see it.  I don't know.  So, like, that has happened.  So, I could see a kissing session kind of going down in the room.  Look, you look at each other.  Maybe not between the two of you.  No.  Maybe someone else.  Why?  Have you seen her kissing girls?  What's happened with her?  She is... 
[03:16:00]  She's a good girl.  You got Anthony annoyed today.  No, no.  It's very rare.  I can tell.  Why?  I just...  I'm trying to get this personality from you and I'm really not getting anything.  Yeah.  That hurts me.  What's kind of wild?  I think you're holding back.  That's all.  Yeah, you're holding back.  Because I don't know.  I don't know.  What would you consider the wildest thing you've ever done in your life?  I went on spring break.  That was pretty wild.  All right.  Where did you go?  Daytona.  Daytona.  And what happened down there that was wild?  That you came back and went, wow, that was the moment. 
[03:16:30]  Oy.  What happened?  It's pretty crazy.  Did you take random cock from a guy in a baseball hat?  What was it?  I'm not like a whore.  I'm sorry.  We're not saying you're a whore.  Yeah.  Or a slut or anything.  You're 21 years old.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So nothing like crazy.  Basically, on spring break, you wake up.  You drink.  Then you drink some more.  Then you drink some more.  Then you drink some more.  Then you go to bed.  Then you nap.  And then you wake up and start drinking again.  So you're drunk for like...  Boring.  Boring.  Sorry.  That's what happened.  So that's the wildest thing.  A lot of drinking.  Yeah.  Were you hanging out with guys?  Sometimes I drive with my eyes closed. 
[03:17:00]  Is that why?  Oh.  Were you hanging out with guys?  It sucks it's your last appearance.  Not really.  No?  I'm sorry.  Just hanging out with your girlfriends?  Oh, well.  What kind of car do you drive?  A 98 Ford Escort.  Holy shit.  Classy, right?  Could be the most boring vehicle ever put on the road.  I've got a sunroof.  I know.  It looks like the driver's ed cars.  You've got a sunroof.  All right.  How about a flash?  It's wild.  How about a flash?  I don't think so.  Oh, come on.  Just a clit.  No cameras.  No way.  But I have to.  I'm not dull.  So I'm going to have to work on that. 
[03:17:30]  We're going to have to work on this really good.  I'm not saying you are dull.  I'm saying you come across as dull.  Because I don't know you enough to say you are dull.  Right.  I'm just saying you come across as dull.  That's what I'm saying.  That's all.  It's tragic.  Yeah, a little bit.  All right.  It is.  You guys will have to come out with us and see how we really are.  See how your role.  We'll be at FH Riley's Saturday.  Saturday.  In the heart of FH Riley's.  Drop in FH Riley's.  Ten minutes from my house.  Have a shot and get all fucked up.  Yeah. 
[03:18:00]  I need to drink to have a good time, though.  I do.  All right, Pamela.  Thank you so much.  Bye, Pamela.  Guess, you're out of the hot seat.  Amazing.  My ass is burning.  And you can sit back down on the couch and enjoy the show.  Wait, do you wear thongs or boy shorts?  That's not a bad question.  Yes.  Yes.  Guess.  Which you prefer?  Guess.  Come on.  Can't you tell?  Oh, guess you said.  Yeah.  Boy shorts.  I'm going to go with thongs.  That's boy shorts.  Stop.  I hope he is correct.  Stop.  Wow.  He's correct.  All about the boy short.  Nice.  It's a great thing.  What color?  Best invention.  What color?  I have multiple colors. 
[03:18:30]  I mean now.  Do you wear the ones that show off your hiney?  Like a little bit sticking out?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's cute.  It's comfortable as well around the home.  Do you shave?  You can tell me.  I shave everything.  Oh, goodness.  Yeah, show her.  Show her, Jimmy.  You don't have to show her the cock.  Just where you shave the whole thing.  I believe you.  Jimmy shaves everything.  Everything.  Really?  I think it's a day or two.  Have you ever waxed?  No, I don't need to.  You want to show her just down to the tree trunk?  I won't show her anything. 
[03:19:00]  Fuck.  No, I know.  There's nothing inappropriate.  No, watch.  But he'll show that he shaves everything.  So then you can answer the question.  See how we work here?  I see.  Very nice.  Nothing inappropriate.  Very nice.  Yeah, so you just showed what?  The pubic area?  Yeah.  She shaves everything.  I think most girls do.  How much do you, though?  Do you leave it?  I leave nothing.  It's like a baby cock.  Yeah.  Yeah.  In size and hair.  Absolutely.  And smell.  I tinkle all over it.  And I wait for it to be one way.  I've seen porn from like the 70s when no one shaved.  It's very disturbing.  Wow, see?  That's a little wild. 
[03:19:30]  You watch 70s porn.  Uh-oh.  See?  That's kind of cool.  Good music.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you shave everything?  Do you shave thoroughly?  Even if you don't do anal, do you make sure you get to eat?  Because you hate the chicks that will just shave the lip area but leave a few wiry ass  hairs hanging out of the asshole.  I'm not a hairy person.  Like, look, I have no arm hair.  No hair.  I have very light, wispy arms.  Yeah, look at Timmy's.  He's got little...  Wow.  Aw.  You have smooth baby skin. 
[03:20:00]  He has no hair on his whole body.  He has amazing calves.  People tell me I have good calves.  Or calves, I should say.  Yeah.  Like bowling pins.  Do you work them out?  No, I don't need to.  Look at that calf.  Can I?  Yeah, ooh.  Oh, oh.  Very nice.  It's defined.  Toned.  Good calves.  That's right.  I have no abs or cock, but good calves.  Give a lower leg fetish.  Yeah.  Brother Joe is texting.  He's calling you Girls Gone Mild.  Yeah. 
[03:20:30]  That was their spring break in Daytona.  Girls Gone Mild.  All right, listen.  Spring break.  Watch him take out library books and bring him back a day, lady.  They wake up, drink, and then nah.  Woo!  We're going to give you a very rare opportunity.  We're going to give you a chance to come up with something else for the radio show.  Okay.  We like you.  Mm-hmm.  We like you both.  I like you back.  But we think your time might be done, unfortunately.  I like you back.  And we have a whole list of people that you just don't hear from anymore.  Waiting in line for me?  No, that you just don't hear from anymore because they, you know. 
[03:21:00]  Yeah, they kind of just kind of faded away to the wayside.  I'm inventive, imaginative, and I'll come up with something else.  Yeah, that's kind of the term.  We didn't want to say it, but I hope you just said it.  You don't want to be.  Today is that one-trick pony, one-hit wonder kind of a thing.  Right.  So you got to come back and break the, you know, sophomore jinx with your next thing that you do.  It's tough, but I'll work on it.  We'll give you like a, I don't know, a day, I guess.  Yeah.  A day?  You should be able to come up.  Well, I'm going back to school, so. 
[03:21:30]  Where's school?  Buffalo.  Ugh.  I don't like it.  When are you going back?  Sunday.  Aw.  What about university?  What college are you attending?  University of Buffalo.  Ah.  The old U of B.  Studying what?  Communication.  Yeah, she gave a resume and everything.  I did.  It's impressive.  Did you read it?  I've done radio yet.  No, but a homeless guy is.  What do you mean?  Hey.  I don't have it.  Sassy.  You're so sassy.  All right, listen, we got to take a break. 
[03:22:00]  We got Jeff Goldblum calling in.  Yeah.  I'm very happy.  So we got a break before he calls.  All right.  Yeah, let's do that.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  And you could, you know.  Well, Brian from Philly, Pamela's so boring she went on spring break and couldn't get date  raped.  Uh-huh.  I just read them.  That was a good one.  Well, a lot of people are calling in, too.  Amazing.  Well, yeah.  Maybe you should leave right now. 
[03:22:30]  Kenny, can you get her out of the studio?  She won't leave.  Be nice to her.  Oh, my God.  Look at her.  She's so insulted.  I'm kidding.  I thought you could take anything.  All right, give me a hand.  That's how this bit started.  There's no crying in whatever you are.  She's sensitive.  Why are you sensitive?  You said you could take anything.  Hold it.  What happened?  No, you were harsh about that one.  It's okay.  Yeah, yeah.  I almost had Kenny have her removed.  Yeah.  That's humiliating.  Because Kenny walked in.  He had no idea what was going on.  So in Kenny's world, he thought something was really going on. 
[03:23:00]  No, Kenny's like a robot.  Like, he doesn't understand that anything's a joke.  Like, when Opie said that, he absolutely was going to remove you.  Yeah, I thought.  Then Opie had to stop him.  Like, he's a complete automaton.  I feel like I was on, like, Judge Judy or something, having to, like, be carried away.  There you go.  He's not allowed to use deductive reasoning.  Yeah, yeah.  He's not allowed.  He used a word, and that's what he does.  Yeah.  We got Jeff Goldblum, everyone.  Oh, good.  All right.  Thank you, Pam.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Jeff.  Hey. 
[03:23:30]  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Thank you.  My pleasure.  That's Jeff Goldblum.  Hi, Jeff.  Do you know who we are?  I know you very, very well.  Oh, no.  No.  Come on.  I've got the satellite radio.  I listen all the time.  Wait.  Name one thing we've done.  One thing?  Yeah, because we can name a few things you've done.  It's only fair.  The fly.  Independence Day.  Yes.  Rain.  And our favorite clip, by the way, Jeff, is you.  Yes.  Our favorite clip.  Now, you understand satellite radio, we're able to say, pretty much, we don't have to adhere 
[03:24:00]  to FCC rules.  Really?  Yeah.  And we have been playing a clip of yours from one of your earlier movies for quite a while  now.  It's one of our favorites.  Yeah.  Sometimes it's very appropriate when there's a girl on the phone that seems to come from  money and doesn't know what she's talking about.  And we play this one.  Now, you might, is this familiar to you?  God damn rich cunts.  I kill rich cunts.  That's a hell of a way to start your movie career. 
[03:24:30]  That really?  My God.  Probably.  That was my first job.  How about that?  One of the best performances ever with the Jughead hat on and just beating that woman senseless.  That was Hope Lange.  Yes.  Hope Lange.  I try to get those lines into every audition I do.  I try to squeeze them in.  Oh, yeah.  It's appropriate for so many situations.  Yeah.  You can always get that in.  You were, I don't even think you got like a name credit on that.  You were like thug.  Yeah.  Freak number one or something.  Freak number one.  Yeah. 
[03:25:00]  Geez.  Must seem like a while ago with the long career you've had.  Many lifetimes ago.  How about that?  Yeah.  I've been lucky.  You may not remember me.  Jeff is one of my very rare celebrities.  No, no, no, no.  I met Jeff.  I'm a fan.  I was walking by the theater and Broadway.  Him and Billy Crud up had done a play.  Yeah.  And he was one of the first celebrities that ever recognized me.  Get out of here.  You probably won't know me because you're not looking at me now.  Yeah.  Because I used to be on Tough Crowd.  And we were talking and Jeff looked at me and goes, you used to be on Tough Crowd.  Oh.  Yeah.  This is Jimmy Norton.  He won't know my name, but I mean, he remembers. 
[03:25:30]  He might remember the face.  I was the weirdo who we talked for a while, who you thought was in the same business you  are.  And then I asked for a picture.  Jimmy Norton.  Yeah.  Great.  You're great.  Thank you.  You know, I do.  I remember that moment.  And I remember Tough Crowd.  That was great.  I like, yeah, we love Tough Crowd.  It's a shame they took that off.  The greatest part was that Jeff couldn't remember Colin Quinn's name, which I can't tell you  the joy that has brought me.  He's like, who was the guy that hosted that?  I'm like, just.  I remember that conversation.  That's right.  I was so, I've never been happier. 
[03:26:00]  And I asked some woman to take a picture of me and Jeff.  And she looked like I had just asked if I could knock her up for stem cells.  She's like, what?  I'm like, just snap a picture of us.  That was funny.  So we're very happy.  Are you doing a show with Elon Gold?  I didn't do a show with him, but I know him.  He does a good impersonation of me, doesn't he?  Oh, you're with Dove Davidoff you're doing?  Dove Davidoff is in it.  And Linda Park.  And Nicole Sullivan is in it.  And Malik Ioba and Matt Craven and Madeline Stowe. 
[03:26:30]  Madeline Stowe?  How sexy is she, man?  She was like.  Yeah, she's totally great.  Oh, she's.  I wanted to bang her for years.  She was in that Ray Liotta flick where he played the cop.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She was lovely.  Yeah, she's wonderful.  She plays my therapist in this.  What do you think about, because you're one of those guys that people like to imitate.  You've been imitated on SNL a few times.  Do you get a chuckle at that?  I do.  I get a kick out of it.  Yeah.  They really make you come off as a nut. 
[03:27:00]  Yeah.  Different people do it.  David Duchovny did one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's the one I remember seeing.  So what do you do any?  Did anybody there do a Jeff Goldblum?  No one does a Jeff Goldblum here.  That's my favorite thing Elon does, though.  Like, I'll never ask a comic to do impressions, but when I'm assuming to sound like you've got  to do Goldblum.  And he'll always make me wait until the end of the set.  That's hilarious.  South-centered ass he is.  He makes me watch his whole set.  And then he does it at the end.  That's funny.  I'm a sucker for impressions.  I love impressions.  I love to hear people do impressions. 
[03:27:30]  Yeah.  But, like, of who, though?  They're random.  I'm like, anybody.  Doesn't he do Charles Grodin?  Does he do Grodin?  I think he does Grodin.  I like hearing very obscure impressions that no one else does.  And you're like, wow.  Like people's relatives.  But once someone does the impression, then other comics can figure out how they did the  impression.  And, like, the first guy to do Walken, I don't know if it was Jay Moore, but then everyone  was doing an impression of Jay Moore's impression of...  That's great.  Yeah.  It makes it easier. 
[03:28:00]  Yeah.  Definitely.  That's right.  I have to do a movie now.  I'm about to leave to do this movie in Romania in Israel called Adam Resurrected, where I'm  supposed to be an animal impersonator, among other things, a violinist and a mind reader.  But I have to come up with an impersonation of a dog.  Have you ever seen anybody do an impersonation of a dog, a really good one?  Only in German pornography.  Oh, my.  I can't say that I have.  What, are you going to, like, study a dog for a few months?  I've been trying.  I've been looking around for something to do.  I think I've got something.  But, you know, Cheech and Chong used to do kind of a little dog act. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah.  You know, I've been looking around.  Well, I'm glad this is a phoner.  I'd hate to have you greet the guys here in the studio the way dogs do.  They sniff around, don't they?  Yeah, they tend to.  I know.  And you've been, listen, you're, I mean, you're a really respected, great actor.  Have you done a scene with anybody that you, I always ask actors when they call in, have  you done a scene with anybody that you're kind of starstruck working with that you're  like, I'm really impressed to be working with this person?  I get kind of thrilled to be, to work with a lot of people that I've seen. 
[03:29:00]  Let me see.  Let me see.  Let's see.  And then I work with, well, you know, this movie, The Life Aquatic that we did with  Wes Anderson, boy, there was not only Willem Dafoe who's in this movie that I'm going to  do now, but Angelica Houston and Bill Murray was in that, you know, Cate Blanchett, you  know, I admire a lot now.  Were you ever intimidated by another actor, like somebody like you doing who's a bigger 
[03:29:30]  name or like when you were, when you were newer that you're like, oh, fuck, I'm working  with it.  I know this is not going to go well.  Really?  No, I don't know.  What about the opposite?  Did you ever work with someone who's like, this person is so overrated, but I'm going to  have to paste on that respectful look and just get...  No, but I've run into, no, no, not that so much.  People are, you know, people are talented, but sometimes they're not nice, you know, and 
[03:30:00]  I get disappointed with that sometimes, very rarely.  Have you ever openly talked shit about another actor on a radio interview?  No, I wouldn't do it.  I can't do it.  That's what Doug's going for.  But I'm thinking about somebody now who wasn't particularly nice.  I know you are.  You just got to read your mind.  They weren't really nice to you?  No.  Can you do an impression of them?  I wish I could.  I wish I could do impressions.  All right.  Male or female.  We'll start there.  Ed Oaken Can't Sleep.  Yeah.  What's the movie?  It had to be one of his older films because... 
[03:30:30]  You're making us go through your bio now.  This is...  We're just...  We're just jerks, Jeff.  You're not.  Nobody would call you jerks to your face.  Into the night.  Of course, Michelle.  Hey, why don't we talk about the show, then, Raines?  Okay.  What's it about?  You're a detective, right?  I'm a detective.  Frank Darabont, who did Shawshank Redemption, and Green Mile directed the pilot episode.  Graham Yost, who did Boomtown Created.  I'm a detective, homicide detective in modern-day Los Angeles, but there's a kind of a noir flavor  to it, you know? 
[03:31:00]  And a few months ago, we find out I had some shootout where some bad things happened.  I got wounded, and my friend got killed.  And I've been having a crisis.  I've been drinking more and not being able to sleep, and I start hallucinating.  I start seeing things that aren't there, and I have to keep it secret.  I have to cover for it because they don't want you to keep a gun and have that going on.  But that's what happens.  So this is a drama, obviously.  Yeah.  It's kind of...  It's an hour for NBC hour drama with some funny things in it, you know? 
[03:31:30]  Is Dove David off a good actor?  He's a wonderful actor.  He studied with Bill Esper, who I also studied with, who taught along Sandy Meisner and teaches  Sandy Meisner's methods, and he's terrific.  That really bugs me because he's a friend of mine.  I was hoping to get him a good trashing.  You know what I always have problems doing?  What do you do with your hands?  I never know what to do with my hands when I'm in a scene.  Like, I always want to, like, wave them too much or just hang them there like I'm paralyzed.  Here's what to do. 
[03:32:00]  You forget about them, and you let whatever happens to them happen, and put your attention  on the other actor and on what you're trying to actually do.  Oh.  See, they always say that you're supposed to focus.  See, I've never focused on the other person.  They always say, like, the other person is the focus.  I always just watch their mouth move until it stops, and then I yell my lines at them.  Well, that could work, too.  I don't know.  Great technique.  Everybody's got their own.  There's no magic formula.  They'll be teaching the Norton technique someday.  So what's the worst part about being a... 
[03:32:30]  I mean, we obviously know you've had a little thing here recently.  Have you had that happen often where people just can't get enough of you and decide to  show up at your house?  No, not often.  It's just a special thing, and that's kind of a drag.  But mostly people are very, very nice, you know?  Yeah, you're a pretty recognizable guy.  Yeah, I know.  When somebody is hassling you or stalking you or whatever, it happens to most performers  at one point.  Does it bring a lot of anger up?  I mean, for me, I've had people just show up at a gig that I wanted to smash in the face 
[03:33:00]  if I see them two weeks in a row.  Yeah.  It can be disturbing, you know?  I mean, I'm sort of sad for them in a way because they can be kind of nutty.  But, yeah, it can be very annoying, and it does bring up a lot of things.  That's right.  We're stupid.  We had a stalker, and instead of calling the police,  we invited her on the show, and now she just hangs out to the point where she used  to live under the stairs at the old radio station.  Yeah.  And she was a true â€“ she started out as a stalker, but now we all look at her and 
[03:33:30]  just kind of like, oh, it's Patty.  So that's one way to handle it.  Yeah, you just invite them into your life.  Yeah.  Which is not the smartest thing.  I'm the worst, though, man, because if a girl is halfway decent, I'll sleep with her.  I don't care.  I don't care if she shows up with a rock at my front door at three in the morning.  If she's good-looking, I'll bring her in.  I'm like â€“  So that's just going to ask if you ever had that one chick where you go,  this chick is definitely going to be a problem if I give her even the time of date,  but I can fuck her.  And you always make the wrong choice. 
[03:34:00]  Well, you do.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jeff's not going to comment.  No, Jeff's not biting on that.  That's fine.  Well, good luck with the show, Reigns.  Thank you, guys.  We're big fans, man.  Absolutely.  We've been playing that clip, no joke, all the time.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Thanks.  Please squeeze it in.  Everyone else would talk about any other huge movie you were in, but we're like,  no, man.  He was in Death Wish.  Oh, that's a great movie.  All I want to do is ask you Death Wish â€“  Death Wish â€“  Yeah, that â€“  Yeah, Death Wish and The Fly is all â€“ 
[03:34:30]  I just â€“  I want to know about the â€“  Actually, one of my favorites was the remake of The Body Snatchers.  Yeah, Phil Kaufman directed that.  I like that movie.  Oh, yeah.  We just bought that.  Yeah, yeah.  I forget how absolutely horrified that was.  Yeah.  Really one of the best horror movies ever.  Yeah.  Stay right there, Mr. Bunnell.  How do you know my name?  I love that one.  Great movie.  Which, which?  Invasion of the Body Snatchers.  Yeah, Body Snatchers.  That was just a really good one.  I like that.  With your little bloody nose and tissue shoved up there.  I know.  I just ran into Veronica Cartwright recently. 
[03:35:00]  Yeah.  And she's in the â€“  I think they remade it, and she has a part in it.  Yeah, they remade it again.  Again, yeah.  I just saw that reason.  She said she had a little part in it, yeah.  Pretty cool.  She was great in Alien.  Yeah, she was great in Alien.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  She just does that panicked woman thing so great.  And she â€“ is it her sister?  Her sister is in The Birds, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, they were the little sister.  The little girl in The Birds.  Her sister was, what, Penny in Lost in Space?  Was she?  Oh, really?  Yeah. 
[03:35:30]  Angelica.  No, Angelica.  Angelica Cartwright.  Angelica Cartwright, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's right.  Look at us talking TV history.  All right.  Well, we're very happy that you called in, man.  We wish you a lot of luck with the show.  We are definitely fans.  Thank you so much, guys.  It's on tomorrow night on NBC at 9 o'clock, Reigns, with Jeff Goldblum.  Thanks, man.  Is it â€“ yeah, it's different times in different parts of the country, huh?  Yeah, it says it's Fridays 9 to 10.  That is Eastern time.  Wait a minute.  All right.  Hold on.  No, Jeff's on to something here. 
[03:36:00]  I should read this right.  So, Reigns premieres this Thursday and next Thursday at 10 o'clock.  Yeah.  Okay.  Eastern time on NBC.  Then it's on its regular night Friday â€“ oh, wow, this is confusing â€“ Fridays on NBC at 9 o'clock.  How about the next two Thursdays, March 15 and 22, 10 o'clock NBC?  There you go.  That's right.  You'll find it after that.  Yeah, you go.  Just TiVo it.  If they like it, they'll definitely find it.  That's it.  And TiVo it like we all do nowadays.  I love that TiVo.  It's great, right?  Yeah, it's great. 
[03:36:30]  So, one thing you liked about the show?  Me?  One thing I liked about the show?  Yeah, the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, the Opie and Anthony show?  Yeah, you got the XM.  You listen all the time.  Just one thing we've done.  That's all.  I always like when Norton's on.  And when you play that clip from the death of the show.  Right.  See?  Two things he knows.  He's a fan.  Yeah, you're all right, man.  Thank you, Jeff.  Thank you so much, guys.  See you later, man.  Jeff Goldblum.  Hey, that started turning into good radio. 
[03:37:00]  Can we get the chicks back in and bring it down again?  All right, Tom.  Jesus.  As we are quickly forgotten by Jeff Goldblum.  We do five hours of this shit every day.  We're not going to get a fist story every 15 minutes.  He forgot us so quickly.  As he was hanging up, he was just like, was that a wrong number?  He didn't even remember.  Yeah, what?  A wrong number?  What was I just talking about?  A publicist is like, all right, now you're going to talk to some douches from Cincinnati.  You're on the Slappy and Wappy Show.  And he's like, hey, I love you guys. 
[03:37:30]  Yeah.  I like Goldblum.  He's a good actor.  All right.  Line of the day.  And we'll wrap up this mess next week.  I agree.  Doug Stanhope.  Wow, across America, true tales from the road.  Real people, real stories, real boob.  O&A, I just saw some big, wet, juicy titties.  Thank you.  Wow.  Hey, O&A, this is Lolo out in California, truck driver.  She's passed up by a black Honda Civic.  Beautiful pair of brown tits. 
[03:38:00]  Beautiful, beautiful.  Tell that lady, thank you very much for allowing me.  Hey, E-Rock.  Let's turn around, pal, talk.  Pop that shirt up.  Let us see them titties.  I got wild in California when I was working by a fat bitch.  She was 400 pounds of sweetness.  Her titties jiggled like the wind.  Oh, my God.  I'm about to crash into a car.  I'm so horny.  Ha, ha, ha.  Yo, what up?  My name is Bob.  And I've seen some big old titties on the Long Island Expressway this morning. 
[03:38:30]  She had big old nipples that looked like oranges cut in half.  Hey, it's Mueller from Long Island.  Just wanted to say I love you guys.  I just had a shitty day at work, and I just got wowed on the 135.  If you get wowed, call the O.P. and Anthony wow line, 866-WOW-ME-05.  And if you need a wowed figure, go to OpieAndAnthony.com.  All right. 
[03:39:00]  All right.  Another bang-up job today.  A lot of fun.  Yeah.  I even joined the segment with Pamela there.  Oh, who did?  We didn't get what we wanted, but it was still all right.  It was all right.  She did.  We really know what we wanted.  But I mean, you know, when you think about the Opie and Anthony show today, you're going 
[03:39:30]  to think of one thing.  Huh?  The fisting story.  The Doug Stanhope fisting story.  Some broad with five kids in Florida.  We could have only fisted her while she sang.  Well.  What a memory that woman had.  Yeah.  I would guess she probably, you think you're the first and last fist she's ever had?  Probably not.  I mean, it seems like a no-brainer.  You're like a famous fist.  Yeah.  Were you fisted before? 
[03:40:00]  I think I fisted one other chick and I just, I can't remember who it was, but I-  Is it your thing?  No, no.  But if you get a pussy that big, you're like, hey, might as well.  Yeah.  You're there.  You might as well enjoy the amenities.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Not a lot of girls can do this.  It's like a snake dislodging its jaw.  Oh, you're kind of, wow.  How the fuck?  I got four fingers in and a little bit of thumb.  I'd say more four fingertips and the thumb just kind of got like, you know, it crossed  the plane.  Again, you know.  So, you were making a little sock puppet hand. 
[03:40:30]  Yeah, but yeah, this was, this was, you know, a monkey grabbing the peanut, he can't get  his hand out, that kind of thing, you know?  I'm trying to think if there's anything else worth doing.  We got a drug story.  We could get out of the way real fast and then get out of here.  Father hides cocaine in a six-year-old's jacket.  Yeah.  Yeah, fuck him.  Fuck him, right?  Yeah.  If he hit it in his underpants like moths, he can't follow that, though.  Yeah.  Oh, here's a cute story. 
[03:41:00]  We'll do this one and then we'll get out of here.  Don't want to give it away.  Well, the other story's kind of cute.  Which one?  This sounded cute with a little six-year-old with cocaine.  Eh, but that's been done before.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, this was a random home burglary and a random sexual assault committed by a career  criminal, according to detectives at the Daytona Beach Police Department.  The man who was responsible has been arrested 28 times for similar crimes, but this one may  land him behind bars for the rest of his life. 
[03:41:30]  What did he do this time?  Yeah, this one.  Right, this one.  Oh, God.  Home invasion 28 times?  Right?  How the hell do you not...  Like, if I did one thing wrong, I know I'd be in jail for, like, forever.  Yeah.  How do these people, like, 28 fucking times...  Our let's play, what did he do?  Because you guys don't know.  I got it in front of me.  So, home invasion 28 times.  The last time may be the one that gets him to go to jail.  Oh, didn't he rape the bitch?  Did you cheat?  No, he said it at the beginning of the story. 
[03:42:00]  He did?  He said sexual assault or something.  See, he's the only one that listens on the show, Doug.  I know.  Yeah, I know.  I was going to say, hid the doilies.  Gold star for you.  Oh, I was listening.  How many gold stars do you have now?  Oh, my God.  It's like fills up my refrigerator.  Send him behind bars for the rest of his life.  Police say 38-year-old Lenard Jackson cut the power to a 68-year-old woman's home while  she was sleeping last night.  He then broke in through a window and sexually assaulted the woman for more than two hours. 
[03:42:30]  After the sexual assault authorities say, Jackson fell asleep, leaving the victim enough time  to run to a neighbor's house and call police.  He fell asleep after he fucked her up.  He fucks them when they're in their 60s.  Sometimes it takes you a while to come.  Yeah, right?  Two hours.  He's surprised.  Wow.  It took him two hours.  Why don't you try it?  Then he dozes off.  Right.  She wore him out.  He's stacked.  He's fucking stacked. 
[03:43:00]  Bet you'd be up here with one of your bitches.  Hold me, Grandma.  I had a nightmare that I fucked a 68-year-old woman.  Can I sleep in your bed?  Well, this is how the cops found him.  Now, when authorities arrived, they found Jackson still asleep in the victim's bed.  He's a career burglar, and I hope that he rots in his jail cell for the two hours that  he tormented and sexually assaulted this woman.  This could be somebody's mother.  This is somebody's grandmother.  And have this animal just break into her house and do what he did to her, it defies, I cannot 
[03:43:30]  come up with words other than despicable and vile, and I hope he rots in his jail cell  for what he did.  That's it.  Despicable and vile?  Those are good words.  Yeah, very good.  She was asking for it, by the way, she was swinging her colostomy bag like a flapper  girl.  And finally.  Police say Jackson's been arrested 28 times for robbery, burglary, and stealing and stolen  property. 
[03:44:00]  He was released from state prison just last June.  Now, the police chief says this latest crime puts the nail in his coffin, and he blames  the legal system for letting this criminal out on the streets in the first place.  There you go.  What the hell is he doing out?  I don't know.  The guy breaks into houses 28 fucking times.  We are doomed as a nation.  Yeah, just squash him.  Just doomed.  You're a revolting, despicable scum of the earth who should be taken outside and squashed like  a bug.  Your Honor, my client has not been found guilty yet. 
[03:44:30]  You're absolutely right, Counselor.  It's 7.30.  At 7.31, he will be guilty.  And then they all look at the clock.  I find the man guilty.  You know that?  And fucking injustice.  And injustice.  I'm a loyal Colts fan.  You're also a revolting, despicable scum of the earth.  Greatest lines ever.  Revolting.  To have the judge say that before he sentences you doesn't bode well.  You know you're not walking out that day. 
[03:45:00]  Oh, scum of the earth.  Deuce chills from Jersey.  Opie, you tool.  What happened to yesterday's real or fake?  Oh, that's right.  Do we have time?  No, tomorrow, I think.  Well, we're trying to figure out if this is real or fake.  Okay, where is he now, ma'am?  I have no idea.  Oh, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am.  No, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am. 
[03:45:30]  No, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am.  Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.  Wow.  That was Patty singing again.  I heard someone singing or something in the background.  Well, yeah.  You might have.  Was that created?  No, it wasn't created.  That's the original call, Jimmy.  No, but the original call is the original call, right?  The whole thing is the original call. 
[03:46:00]  It was just like we just found the actual version on the Internet.  Yeah, that's what it was.  That's right.  Oh, cool.  I've got to get your autographs after the show.  Remind me for this little kid, Butters, in my small town I live in.  Butters.  This kid, I moved to this town, like 6,000 people, and this little, he's 21,  but he's kind of like a 12-year-old, and he's very much like Butters.  And he emailed me, you live in my town.  I work at the gas station.  So if you ever, and I'm like, oh, great.  Now I get free oil changes, so I go down. 
[03:46:30]  And then he's, I don't want to say anything bad about him.  He should be gay, but he wouldn't even be good at that.  He just emailed and said, I think I'm going to join the Renaissance Festival.  I'm like, that's exactly where you belong.  He, like, draws pictures of dragons and stuff, and he's just very effeminate.  But he's a huge fan, and make sure I get you to sign a bumper sticker for Butters. 
[03:47:00]  Wow.  I will give him a picture, a photo.  No photos.  Butters.  We'll give him a T-shirt.  He asked for a bumper sticker autographed, and that's what he'll get.  Get a lounge sticker, somebody immediately.  Make sure he doesn't eat it.  What if we throw you a T-shirt, too?  Sure, sure.  Make sure Butters has it?  Yes.  Butters will, you know, like, once we, like, kind of made friends with him, then he'd, like,  come over to the house and bang on the door.  Hey, I had some leftovers from my, he's a Spanish kid or half Spanish or something.  So he'd bring us, like, tubs of menudo and stuff. 
[03:47:30]  Oh, God.  Well, you can freeze it if you don't want to eat it out of you.  Oh, my God.  He's such a nice kid.  You wish he was an asshole, so you go, hey, fuck off, all right?  Yeah, leave me alone.  Oh, wow.  Any, uh, any, uh, background on him?  Like, like...  No, he's, like, a kid that works in this small town, and he goes to community college, and  he draws little cartoons, and he's, uh...  Yeah, you go, like, this kid should have cocks falling out of his mouth, as effeminate as  he is, but... 
[03:48:00]  What did Jimmy sign it?  What did he sign it as?  He wrote, hi, hi, you fat spig.  Jimmy, get another bumper sticker.  Get another sticker for butter.  He's on my message board, and they torture this kid so badly.  I wonder why.  And he's like, LOL.  He doesn't even get that they're, like...  All right, here's another bumper sticker. 
[03:48:30]  All right, Jimmy.  Oh, no, no.  It's for butters.  Come on, Jimmy.  Jesus.  Two butters.  Doug, it's kind of strange to live in a small town.  I'm being a comic and all.  Well, I mean, I party so much on the road.  I'm on the road 40, 45 weeks a year.  When I go home, I mean, there's one traffic light in my town.  Nobody bothers you.  There's nothing...  Yeah, I like that when I go home.  Where are you from originally?  I grew up in Massachusetts, and then I lived in L.A. for 10 years.  Well, I moved as soon as I was legally old enough. 
[03:49:00]  I quit school at 16, and then me and my dad just sat there watching the clock until I was  legally old enough to leave.  It's like the bell went off.  I'm out of here.  Good luck.  Yeah.  Thank you very much.  All right, butters, enjoy.  Sure, butters will...  Butters, E-Rock, get Butters a t-shirt, will ya?  We have our own Butters.  It is E-Rock.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It looks like he's...  You want to get out of here?  Get Butters a key to his own closet door so he can get out in the world and blow guys 
[03:49:30]  like his conscience is telling him to.  He works in the gas station.  There's his dad's gas station.  He's a mechanic, and Butters is so inept.  His dad has to help him change a tire and stuff.  You know his dad's always trying to man him up.  No, it just ain't working.  There's a satellite t-shirt.  He's into anime and stuff, and they'll bring you anime-related gifts.  Really?  Yeah, not the hentai porn, but actual anime. 
[03:50:00]  Thank you guys very much.  No problem.  Thank you, man, for coming in.  I'll be back.  I'll be back in May.  Fucking pisser, man.  You got to leave tomorrow, or you come back tomorrow?  No, I leave this afternoon for Scotland.  Fucking awful place.  Why is Scotland awful?  I hear it's cool.  It's miserable.  It's just bleak and dismal.  Yeah, gray, everything.  Mossy stone.  In the air always.  The people are fucking ugly.  Everything's moldy.  Fat.  They're not like grotesquely fat like Americans, but they're fat in weird places and awkwardly 
[03:50:30]  shit.  Like they got packed in a hurry.  Some part will be fat, but the rest isn't.  It's a miserable place.  We're supposed to be filming a pilot for BBC4, and I still have no idea what it's about,  and I'm supposed to be ready for it when I land in the morning.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  How many hours is that?  Enjoy yourself.  Probably like seven hours, six hours.  That's a long flight.  Fuck.  Yeah, I gotta go.  I gotta fly to L.A. today.  All right.  Well, get out of here. 
[03:51:00]  Line of the day brought to you by BodogFight.com.  Tune in to ION TV Tuesdays and Saturdays for episodes of Bodog Fights.  For all the mixed martial arts action you can want, check out BodogFight.com.  Got a couple runner-ups today, right?  Here's the first one.  Where are you going to be this weekend, Jimmy?  Ontario, California.  There's going to be eight people there.  It's an hour north of L.A., the improv.  Yeah.  That's where you want to be, an hour north of the major city.  I was trying to work an hour west, but that's the Pacific Ocean. 
[03:51:30]  That's a good runner-up.  This might be Butters, by the way.  Butters.  Butters.  No.  What's up, guys?  Is this Butters?  Yeah, this is Butters.  That's Butters.  Dude, he's talking bad about you, man.  I'm not talking bad.  I'm talking the truth.  You need to come out of the closet.  Are you going to come out of the closet, Butters?  No, I'm not gay.  I had to call up and defend myself.  Yeah?  You were listening? 
[03:52:00]  Yeah.  What do you like about...  I woke up early, too.  What do you like about a woman?  What do I like about a woman?  Yeah.  Pretty much everything.  What was it...  Except for my last girlfriend.  What's the furthest you've got with a woman?  I would say about just feeling up, because I'm pretty much...  I don't know why.  I just kind of revolt them for some reason.  You revolt women?  Yeah, somehow.  Have you ever smelled a cock? 
[03:52:30]  No.  Have you ever had one in your hand as a goof?  Is that my own?  No.  Yeah, like it was a frog.  You just hold it and look at it?  Yeah, just as a goof.  You hold it up to the sun.  He'll sit and he'll tell you stories about his family, and he's always got these Mexican  names for his...  Oh, so I don't know why I was with my tete, and my...  It's just so gay-sounding, and the stories go nowhere, but he's just such a nice kid.  I gotta tell you, from talking to you on the phone, even this short amount of time, Doug 
[03:53:00]  described you a little more retarded than I imagined.  Oh, I'm sorry.  No, he's very childlike.  He's coming off very much like a normal guy.  Big fan of the show, too, huh?  Well, tell him one of your stories about something you've done fun recently.  Yeah, give us a few more words than just, you know, three or four strung together.  Well, recently.  Well, living in a town this big, that's not very much, but... 
[03:53:30]  I'd have to say the last great adventure I had was probably going to the Last Run Fest.  It's bad.  It was about a year ago.  I hardly ever get out.  But we went up there, and me and a few of my friends dressed up and went over there,  and basically just had a good time.  I mean, it's really... 
[03:54:00]  I mean, Anthony's been to those before, so...  And he's not gay.  Yeah, see?  Me and my girlfriend went with Butters and his family to wrap gifts for the orphans over in  Mexico last Christmas.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  That sounds pretty nice.  Hey, is Doug very famous in your town there, Butters?  Only in the bars and one of the card clubs.  Hey, people want to know if you have a MySpace. 
[03:54:30]  Yeah, it's myspace.com slash Hawk4444.  Hawk4444?  Yeah, he has a lot of nicknames.  Yeah, that's my online name.  All right, hold on.  We got Token Gay on the line from Minnesota.  Token Gay, you're on with Butters.  Hi, Butters.  How are you?  Can you hear me?  Good.  Yes, I can hear you.  I just got to say, my gaydar is completely pegged, and the only time it gets pegged is  when I hear you or E-Rock talking. 
[03:55:00]  You think E-Rock's a fruit?  Token, you think...  Oh, E-Rock is hot.  E-Rock's hot?  E-Rock!  E-Rock is so sexy.  Hold on, you like old mumps neck?  Hold on, let's get him in here.  E-Rock, you got a fan on the line.  What?  You haven't been listening to the show?  What are you even doing?  And his MySpace picture is gay.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Let me see.  Butters, your MySpace picture is gay.  Oh, really?  Yeah, you're kind of just...  He wears fingerless gloves, and he'll wear the camouflage bandana headband. 
[03:55:30]  Yeah.  He dresses very flash dance.  I'm seeing pictures of you...  Wow, this one is right out of Brokeback Mountain.  Oh, God.  You got the cowboy hat.  Butters isn't going to be like a raging bathhouse queer.  He'll be the kind of guy that settles down with some old fruit bag, like a retired guidance 
[03:56:00]  counselor, and they'll always keep it quiet.  Wow.  Fucking Doug has your life figured out for you, Butters.  Hey, token gay.  Butters with a toilet on his head.  This isn't a voice...  You're not putting on a voice.  This is how you talk, right?  This is how I talk.  All right.  And you think E-Rock is hot?  I jerk to his MySpace pictures all the time.  The cool one where he's with his sunglasses driving his boat?  Yeah, which picture? 
[03:56:30]  Which picture from E-Rock's MySpace?  Well, the last one I've jerked to was the Paris Hilton one, and I've got that one on my  desktop on my computer.  This guy jerked off to E-Rock.  Oh, God.  E-Rock.  All right.  Doug's getting something else on the computer here.  So, E-Rock, you got a fan.  Token Gay from Minnesota.  Thanks.  Would you kiss E-Rock or just blow him or do both?  Yeah, what would you do to E-Rock if E-Rock said, what the hell?  Well, let's see. 
[03:57:00]  I'd unzip his pants slowly and drop him down to his knees and just tickle the bottom of  his bag a little bit and wait for him to get erect.  You wouldn't have to wait.  Then I'd take his giant glowing cock and just slobber all over it.  E-Rock, would that be good?  Not at all.  Why not?  He wants to gag himself with your prick.  What's wrong with you?  Yeah, it's not gay because it's, I don't know, because he's from Minnesota.  He's a fan. 
[03:57:30]  He's my island.  You know.  Wait, is that you?  Yeah.  We went to one of those Safeway.  They had the roaming photo studio.  They come in for a free sitting.  So, he dressed up all pedophile.  Wait, that's you?  Yeah, that's me.  Holy shit.  Is that on your MySpace?  Yeah, that's on my MySpace.  This is amazing.  This is a picture on Doug Stanhope's MySpace.  It's not the default.  You have to go into the pictures. 
[03:58:00]  Yeah, you go into the pictures and you see him looking like a pedophile, basically.  What a creep.  What book are you holding?  The Bible.  Oh, I can't see because they turned the screen around.  Oh, you look like a fucking ghoul.  You look a lot older, too.  You look like you're in your, I don't know, mid-50s, maybe, in that picture?  Yeah.  Because you have your hair slicked back into the side and creepy little mustache.  Uncle Rico.  Wow.  And an awful suit.  That's hilarious.  Good shot, dude.  Token.  Yeah.  So, last we left you, you were blowing E-Rock, and he was enjoying it. 
[03:58:30]  Yes, he was.  Would you rub his asshole a little bit?  I would stick my little pinky finger in just a little bit and tickle his prostate.  Attaboy.  Just a little bit, but still get, what, does he have a prostate that hangs right up to the outer lips?  You have to get deep in there to get to the prostate, Captain.  How long have you been a queer?  This is your first date?  Jesus.  I got a big pinky. 
[03:59:00]  I'm dog, man.  If I wasn't a truck driver and driving right now, I would be jerking off.  Wait, Token Gate, he's really a trucker.  Yes.  Give us some stats.  How tall are you?  About 5'8".  Yeah, you seem like you might be a small guy.  How much do you weigh?  Yeah, about 125.  Less and less.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Jesus.  I'm actually hauling T-cells to a Robert Reed convention. 
[03:59:30]  There you go.  See, there you go.  I'm looking at Butters' MySpace, and it says, status single, here for friends, and then  it says, orientation, not sure.  Ah, Butters.  What's that all about, Butters?  Let's go back to Butters.  Butters?  Uh, well, well, I remember recently my cousin hacked my MySpace, and I haven't changed a lot  yet.  Ah, yeah, I knew that. 
[04:00:00]  Yeah, right.  No, no, no, I made the mistake of going to his computer and checking my MySpace, and I guess  I must have left the cookies on or something, and he got into it and fucked me all up.  So he said, not sure.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not sure.  No, it was worse than that.  He had the background.  Well, wouldn't he just put gay if he was fucking with you?  Yeah.  If he was just going to hack your MySpace and make you look bad, wouldn't he just put gay?  He would just put not sure.  Sloppy party bottom.  Yeah.  Well, I guess since no one's ever touched Butters on any level from either sex, maybe he wouldn't  be sure. 
[04:00:30]  He's not sure.  Yeah.  Matt from Queensbury describing Token Gay, Smokey and the Butt Bandit.  He's laughing.  Oh, there you go.  Anything else you want to say to E-Rock?  This is your chance there, Token.  I love you, sweetie.  Go Mansfield.  E-Rock, will you talk to your fan?  What's wrong with you?  Go Mansfield?  You know what I mean, sweetie.  Did you go to college with me? 
[04:01:00]  No, I didn't.  I went to somewhere else.  Ew, he knows all about you.  What is the Mansfield reference?  That was one of the campuses.  I went to college.  My stepsister went to college, same place.  So you really know all about E-Rock?  Well, you know, it's not like I'm stalking him or anything.  No, you just know where I went to college.  He jerks off to your pictures.  Come on, sweetie.  What else do you know about E-Rock that we need to know? 
[04:01:30]  That's about it.  Flirt with him, Eric.  Come on, E-Rock.  It's for the show.  Flirt with him.  That's not.  That's all I know about E-Rock.  What do you really like about him?  Why him?  Why, uh...  What is it about him?  He's just cute.  He's adorable.  I don't know what it is.  He's just adorable.  I've got a double chin, sir.  I'm not that attractive.  Look, he's putting himself down now.  Oh, look.  When we make fun of your chubbiness...  Absolutely.  I wear child's clothing, and I, uh... 
[04:02:00]  I'm an ass.  Looks like I have a hairpiece, even though I don't.  Don't you know I like mayo?  I have been in love with E-Rock.  Huh?  I have been in love with E-Rock since he read from the...  What was it?  The book that Jimmy had.  Yeah.  Rent Boys.  Rent Boys.  Yeah, the gay book.  Jesus.  This guy has been listening a long time.  You liked when he read from Rent Boys, huh?  Do you remember the passage?  Um, something about his glistening cock? 
[04:02:30]  I can't remember totally.  I've got to punch out, boys, because I'm heading into the Mississippi River Valley,  and I'm about to lose you.  I love you, sweetie.  That was to you, E-Rock.  I love you, too.  Come on.  No.  Say, I love you, too.  Come on.  He's going.  He's driving.  He might get into an accident.  Take care, sir.  No, no, no, no, no.  Yeah, Jimmy.  Help us out.  Come on.  Just be sweet for once, would you?  It's for the show.  I know.  Tell him.  Tell him what he wants to hear.  I care about you very much. 
[04:03:00]  You don't have to make a full commitment.  Even if you don't mean it, just tell him you love him.  You can even say, even though I have a girlfriend, I love you, too.  Because then everyone will go, all right.  He's not gay.  He just said he had a girlfriend.  Even though I have a girlfriend, love you, too, sweetie.  No, I love you, too.  I love you.  I love you.  Mean it.  Sell it.  Sell it.  Yeah, sell it.  Say, I love you, too.  I love you, too.  That was a party guy.  I love you.  Just say it softly.  Yeah.  I love you.  Stop being an ogre from Revenge of the Nerds.  Just be you. 
[04:03:30]  Will you be my sloppy party bottom, E-Rock?  No.  Token, we do have the clip you're referring to.  How long is it?  Sloppy party bottom.  Listen to this, Doug.  This is actually E-Rock.  The Opium Anthony Show presents True Confessions, filled with honesty, compassion, and understanding.  Today, young Eric admits his love for hot, juicy man meat.  I flipped on the news when I got home, but I couldn't concentrate. 
[04:04:00]  I kept thinking of Jason, his washboard belly, his tightly clipped dick, his beautiful chest,  his succulent, rosy nipples, his pale, smooth ass.  Next thing I knew, I had my pants down around my knees and my shirt pulled up to my armpits.  My nuts dropped down between my outspread legs, nestling warm and heavy against my sweaty asshole.  I took a long pull on my dick, envisioning Jason's ruddy lips nuzzling against the glistening sticky crown. 
[04:04:30]  As I continued to jack off, I fantasized about burying my face in his crack,  tonguing the funky treasure hidden between those perfect ass cheeks.  Thank you for another edition of True Confessions.  I envision Jason squatting over me.  On the Opium Anthony Show.  Tolkien, you like that, right?  Hottest radio ever, boys.  Butters, are you still not sure? 
[04:05:00]  No, I'm pretty sure that I'm straight.  Oh, yeah.  He's really succulent.  I'm pretty sure.  He's selling it.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, I'm sure I'm straight, guys.  Trust me.  I don't know.  That MySpace page.  I've had girlfriends and all that stuff.  All right.  Tolkien.  Oh, there goes Tolkien.  He just beeped and he's gone.  So, Butters, that didn't turn you on, what you just heard?  No, not a bit.  People are checking out your MySpace page.  Babygirl writes, Butters looks like Kitty-like. 
[04:05:30]  Yeah, a little bit.  See you later, man.  Okay.  All right, E.R.  You're likely who that is.  Look at E.R.  He's got a little spring in his head.  He has a little fucking pep to his step.  He's like, fuck you guys, huh?  He's just happy someone likes him, finally.  He doesn't care if he's a gay guy.  He's just happy that someone cares.  He's never heard positive affirmations.  All right.  Hey, Butters.  What's up? 
[04:06:00]  All right.  So, we got you your bumper sticker and your shirt.  All right.  Thank you, boys.  I appreciate it.  Is that it with Butters, Doug?  Yeah, no, I had nothing else.  I didn't mean to ruin his day.  Butters seems like an all right guy.  Butters seems like an all right guy.  Butters, he's the nicest kid in the world.  Come out and just bring him to a bathhouse and just go, just take the cock.  He just screams from every other action.  Butters, you're not that manly looking.  You got very soft features.  How old is he? 
[04:06:30]  He's 21.  21, guys.  Wow.  No facial hair?  No, I shave it all off.  No, it looks like it doesn't even grow is what I'm getting at.  Hardly.  What's your World of Warcraft name?  I don't have one.  No, EverQuest?  I don't play any online games.  EverQuest?  No.  Nope.  I just take care of my Wii.  That's all I need.  Oh, he's got a Wii?  Yeah, I got a Wii.  He's really into this anime stuff, this Japanese anime. 
[04:07:00]  Yeah, I draw a few comics now, man.  Yeah?  All right.  You like the anime?  Yeah, it's fun.  Well, Butters, keep in touch from Doug Stanhope's hometown, all right?  All right.  Even though this...  He's on here.  Whackbag is your message board.  Yeah.  He's always on there.  Oh, there you go.  Are you on Whackbag?  Oh, you're Butters on Whackbag?  No, he's like...  Oh.  Butters is the name we gave him that he keeps trying to get rid of.  Oh, well, now it ain't going anywhere now.  What's your name on Whackbag? 
[04:07:30]  Whackbag.  Hawk4444.  Oh, okay.  Everyone's going to look up his posts.  I've seen you from time to time.  All right, Butters.  All righty, boys.  Thank you much.  I got to go to work and...  Hey, go feed my cat.  Good time to tell somebody to feed your cat.  Yeah, really.  Stop by and feed the cat.  Every now and then.  All right, but is your door unlocked or something?  Well, I'm not going to say it over the air.  You can figure out how to get in, for God's sakes.  You know where the key is. 
[04:08:00]  Oh, yeah, I'm Mexican.  You can fit through the cat door.  All right, Butters.  All right, guys.  Thanks much.  Bye, love.  All the way from Arizona, near the Mexican border, right?  Yeah, like seven miles away.  That's pretty cool.  You never know when you might have to slip over.  Yeah.  All right.  You never know when you're going to have to run south.  Skip country.  Exactly.  Line of the day, we got another runner-up, thanks to Bodogfight.com.  He's really a trucker.  Yes.  Give us some stats. 
[04:08:30]  How tall are you?  About 5'8".  Yeah, you seem like you might be a small guy.  How much do you weigh?  Yeah, about 125.  Less and less.  Well, I'll slip that one in at the last minute.  You got a runner-up.  Makes a runner-up.  All right.  We got one more runner-up?  All right.  That's a damn good one.  Here we go.  Yeah, who was it?  It was an older guy.  Yeah.  How much older?  Not much older.  Okay.  All right.  Both high school.  Some guy in a bookmobile with a fucking hammer. 
[04:09:00]  But I really want to prove that I'm not dull.  All right.  And finally, here is today's line of the day.  Here.  Peace.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  I don't even know.  It was just crazy. 
[04:09:30]  When I set my mind to something, I usually do it.  Yeah.  All right.  Sound like a real go-getter.  And when someone...  I was stuck that night.  And when someone offers me anything at all, I'll usually take it.  So it's weird.  Weird how your determination and my lack of any standards came together.  I didn't know.  I didn't know.  I didn't know.  That was a damn...  Doug Stanhope line of the day.  Of course.  Goddamn.  Hey, you know what?  We got to go home, but maybe tomorrow.  Dan F. from New York. 
[04:10:00]  You have to read his first blog entry on MySpace.  He talks about his masturbatory habits and how he finds anime characters sexy.  It's radio gold.  Can we get that for tomorrow's show?  Yes.  And then, Butters, if you're listening, you're going to have to call back tomorrow, all right?  Butters.  All right.  Doug, it's always a pleasure.  Hey, thanks.  Yeah.  Thanks so much, man.  If you go to my MySpace page, Metro Diners and my top friends in Warren, Rhode Island,  go help my brothers stay out of bankruptcy.  Don't be a stranger.  Thank you.  I'll be back in May.  All right.  Cool.  Absolutely.  We got to get him on the tour, too.  Of course.  I'll figure that out behind the scenes if it's possible. 
[04:10:30]  I'm going to California for tomorrow and through Saturday.  Be safe, Jimmy.  Have fun.  Ontario Improv.  Yeah.  Ontario Improv.  Yeah.  All right.  And thanks to everyone else that was on the show today.  Thanks to the girls.  I don't know.  We've been out of five and a half hours.  I don't even know.  Oh, yeah.  The girls.  Bonus show.
