<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts expressing their profound dissatisfaction with their SiriusXM workplace and colleagues, particularly Ron Bennington, who was a guest in the studio.  Their complaints centered on the lack of interaction between their show and Ron and Fez's despite their adjacent airtimes, criticizing SiriusXM management's perceived lack of radio understanding, exemplified by forced air checks and the exclusion of a Springsteen expert from a listening party.  Opie likened the building to "heaven with a giant shit on the floor." They recounted manipulating air checks, humiliating program directors after success, and a story of Opie accidentally playing an extremely profane Rolling Stones song.  Ron Bennington's elevator anxieties were also a topic of discussion.  The conversation touched on the evolution of radio, the decline of program director autonomy, changing music selection, and past radio experiences. A planned listener segment involving topless women and canned food donations was mentioned, along with their disdain for the studio. A humorous anecdote about a city-versus-city food bet involving Michael Bloomberg was shared, along with discussions about the perceived unhealthiness of certain cities' food.

The show then transitioned into a rambling conversation about nostalgia for a perceived tougher past, contrasting it with modern sensibilities. They discussed their fathers' generation, characterized by heavy drinking and fistfights.  The physicality of 1970s Philadelphia Flyers fans versus the current team was debated.  *Rocky* and the "Rocky Steps" were discussed, alongside reflections on the changing presentation of cities as tourist destinations. One host recounted checking his firearm at a precinct before visiting the Empire State Building, contrasting it with childhood Liberty Bell experiences.  The challenges of parenting and children's television were also discussed.

A significant portion featured a conversation with studio employee Roland about his experience at a Bruce Springsteen listening party, where he was denied a photo with Springsteen.  This led to a discussion about workplace policies and the hosts' history of rule-breaking, including stealing from previous employers, specifically a detailed account of stealing silver.

The show included a segment on a purported UFO sighting in Harlem (later revealed to be Chinese lanterns), punctuated by humorous racial epithets.  Other segments included discussion of Gary Carter's illness, a "Final Countdown" game, and Newt Gingrich's performance in a political debate.  Offensive language and crude humor were frequent throughout this portion.

A substantial segment focused on the 2012 Republican primaries, particularly Newt Gingrich's candidacy and his marital infidelities.  A clip from a contentious debate with John King was played.  The conversation broadened into political hypocrisy, the primary system, and the public's fascination with candidates' personal lives.  Personal anecdotes about relationships and morality were shared, along with numerous movie and pop culture references.  A listener called in, and professional wrestler Mick Foley appeared as a guest, discussing his "Dude Love" entrance video and other wrestling-related topics.  A discussion of Blaxploitation films, specifically "The Legend of Nigga Charlie," ensued, with clips shown.  Mark Cuban's planned appearance was briefly mentioned.  The segment was rife with crude humor and profanity.

The show opened a segment discussing misconceptions young boys have about sex, contrasting it with the hosts' own experiences and the impact of internet pornography. Crude humor and explicit language detailing their sexual experiences were used.  A segment on a list of celebrities allegedly needing stomach pumps was introduced, leading to tangents about rock star antics.  Mick Foley returned, discussing his comedy show and *Celebrity Wife Swap*, showing a picture of his wife.

Mark Cuban joined the show, discussing the Dallas Mavericks' victory, the wrestling team's access to the Mavericks' locker room, and his show *Shark Tank*. He discussed unusual business pitches and the show's dynamics.  The conversation touched upon his personal life, including the freeze-drying of his deceased dog, private jets, and commercial flights.  He promoted *Access.tv*, explaining its live element as a key differentiator.  Discussions about the NBA, referee bias, LeBron James, and the "choke artist" label also occurred. The show concluded with final plugs for Cuban's projects and Foley's comedy show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  We're already laughing.  And we already did about a half hour of radio.  It wasn't on the air, but I'm actually putting it towards our day.  We should.  So, you know, whatever happens.  Sam, take that off the clock.  We get to go home early.  We did 15 minutes of radio for ourselves.  It doesn't work.  Well, it doesn't say who we have to do the radio for in our contract.  We have to do four hours of radio.  So me, Anthony, and Ron Bennington have already done 15 minutes. 
[00:00:30]  The Iron Man of radio right here now.  Look at him.  We have trashed every motherfucker down the hall there possibly is.  We went over them piece by piece.  It's so awful because we don't see each other a lot because of Sam.  Yeah, the in-between guy.  Someone's got to do radio the entire time we're not.  Mr. In-between.  There used to be something called a crossover.  He's the crossover.  And the guys here at SiriusXM don't understand that concept.  They don't understand that maybe they should move Ron and Fez down or maybe we start a little later. 
[00:01:00]  Much later.  Something.  Something where we attach the two shows and do what's called a crossover.  Well, they know that if it was that, we would either show, one or the other would ask like,  hey, if I'm doing an extra hour, you've got to compensate me.  But Sam Roberts, on the other hand, is the freebie.  They could just throw him in any channel, any stage, in any format.  It's free radio for them.  I think this is the first time we've seen Ron Bennington in, I would guess, three months.  I called him Fez when he first walked in.  I didn't even know. 
[00:01:30]  I was like, is that the guy?  Or is that the other guy?  I don't know.  Fez, thank you.  You would think we would see each other a lot considering that Ron and Fez are the next show after ours.  Here's the difference, though.  Because of the hours that you work, you guys leave here like the walking wounded.  Like when I even see you guys in the hall, I feel awful.  It's like guys coming back from NOM.  You got that look in your face like I could never understand what you've been through.  The replacements look at us walking down the hallway and go like, wait a minute, what happened to them? 
[00:02:00]  They don't look good.  Ronny's trying to say hi to us and all we see is the helicopter and get us the fuck out of here.  Get me in the chopper.  Oh, this place will break it down, though.  I don't even know why this place breaks me down.  Like I try to figure it out because I just told you guys, I really do still like doing radio.  I just don't like this place.  I don't know what it is.  It's like this.  It's like if someone came into heaven and took a giant shit on the floor. 
[00:02:30]  You know what I mean?  Like you know it should be perfect.  Right.  You should not hear stuff like time spent listening.  Right.  You know, what the fuck are you talking about?  Because I think every person in this building tried to do a radio show.  Then they failed and then they have to still be part of this.  Right.  Like if you fail at doing your own radio show, you should not be allowed in this building.  Could you imagine like meeting some young guys now and be interested in their show and want to go over it with them and talk about things? 
[00:03:00]  It really comes down to you either can do it or you can't.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  It's not like Louis C.K. goes and talks to a comedy manager after his son.  Right.  You know, like it just doesn't exist in regular places.  Ronnie.  Ronnie's brilliant.  Just for the people that don't know the business.  Like when you're coming up, you have to do what's called air check sessions with a program director and you sit there like and then they pick apart five minutes of your radio show and maybe you're off for that dumb five minutes. 
[00:03:30]  And you're right.  If you either know how to do it or you don't, you know, it was a complete waste of time.  And we had to do it with our general manager because we didn't have a program director.  He wasn't even a guy that like knew anything about rape.  Right.  He was the business guy.  Right.  Yeah.  And then he still felt the need to say to people.  Dude, he stopped the cassette because it was cassettes back then every five to ten seconds.  He's a big troller.  Yeah.  Lifted the needle.  And then he's like trying to stand. 
[00:04:00]  We're in Chester Cathedral.  Listen to your crossover here.  Yowzy, yowzy, everybody.  Right.  Ladies and gentlemen, flash.  The Opie and Anthony show, flash.  Ah, here we are.  The Opie and Anthony show from the great ballroom here on Sirius X on television radio.  And then the guy would go, well, the general manager at the time, he would go, he would  try to explain how he could do that five seconds better.  And I would look at him like, but we're never going to do that again.  And we're like a talk show. 
[00:04:30]  So we're never going to do that.  It'll never happen.  Right.  And when you're on for four hours, for them to pick apart a ten second thing, you said,  now your delivery on that should have been, this was a throwaway.  It's me.  It's called me talking.  How about I critique the conversation you're having with me right now?  It doesn't work.  It's really good.  That's what it is.  You're asking someone to live a better life somehow.  Yes.  And this is what I do worry about is like when you die, there's someone there to go back 
[00:05:00]  over your life.  Like a life air check.  Yeah.  And they're like, why didn't you just pull it out then?  Maybe squirt it on your tits.  I was really fucked up at the time.  I don't know.  Yeah, you could have done that a little better.  Oh, boy.  You know, you're not in my shoes.  You don't know.  They don't do air checks anymore, do they?  Yeah.  Of course they do.  Who does?  No way.  Who does air checks?  The music jocks.  For instance, people on Hits 1.  Hits 1, they have to do air checks?  I do.  I have to do air checks.  Do they realize no one listens to what they're saying? 
[00:05:30]  They just want to hear the stupid songs?  Yeah, it is true.  You know what really sucks, too?  As an on-air talent, you can't just take the tape, go and say, I don't know what happened.  It didn't record.  It ate the tape.  And that whole show is now gone forever.  Ronnie knows the tricks of the trade.  Back in the day, you had your cassette.  And remember, every time the mic turned on, it would hit record.  Yeah.  You had to fucking rewind.  I would go on the-  Record over your shit?  Dude, I would put on a long Led Zeppelin song, because I needed to give them an hour. 
[00:06:00]  And then I'd go in production, I'd rewind the tape, and then put it back into the recording machine.  Sam, is this like hearing about World War II?  I don't even know what the recording machine is.  It's just old stuff, right?  Because like you were saying, you know when you have a shitty break, so you don't need  some asshole to tell you.  Yeah.  So I would just give them a solid air check every time.  They thought I was brilliant.  This guy's great.  Every break is good.  The real, the fucking great thing, though, is as soon as you get any ratings, you fucking  turn the tables so bad that you hate every PD who comes in after that. 
[00:06:30]  Right.  And like, you're kind of, after you get any ratings at all, that guy is your bitch.  You know what I mean?  Right.  So you just, where are our t-shirts?  What the fuck do you do here?  What do you do here?  That is true.  You just look at his hand, and you're throwing his shit off the fuck.  But you're a nice guy up until that point.  Up until then, you're like, hey, you know, I just want to be in this business.  Whatever you need.  This is great.  You need me to work weekends?  I'll work weekends.  Love this place.  The second, like, we fucking turn things, we get a new PD, and we fucking treated him 
[00:07:00]  so bad that one time we were at a live gig, and I made him hold on to my belt loop wherever  we went.  At the gig, he had to follow me around in front of the listeners like a bitch, because I saw  it on Scared Straight.  So I'm like, get my fucking belt loop!  Give me your shoes!  Give me your shoes!  He's just taking them all.  You do start treating him like a bitch, so the second you get any, because that's the  only power you have in radio, are the ratings, at least back in, you know, what I called the 
[00:07:30]  day.  I disliked every PD I've ever worked for.  Every single one.  I liked the first one, and after that, I was fucking, I hated the rest of it.  But this guy, as soon as we got ratings, the guy, his wife was Mexican-American, and  all the time we're like, what's how things in the barrio, huh?  Where is she?  He's like, just trying to get along, and the weird thing is like, he had came there from  like LA, so he at one time felt good about himself, and now he's just like, where, where, 
[00:08:00]  what do you come in by, donkey?  What do you fucking do here?  What do you do?  And they want to fire you so bad.  They just hate you.  But you're the king of ratings, so they can't touch you.  And they're the in-between guy, so they can't even fire you.  They could suggest you be fired, but, you know, if you're doing well, that's your only  power, and I think that's why you turn it around and start beating the shit out of him.  None of these knuckleheads around here can fire us.  No, none.  There's not one guy here that can fire us.  Mr. Karmazin.  Speaking of which, tell Greenstein there was pee on the fucking toilet seats again today.  I want that. 
[00:08:30]  He's got to go in there with some paper towels.  What do you mean it's not his job?  I don't know what he does.  I haven't seen him in three months.  Get some Opie quicker picker upper paper towels and tell him there's some urine on the fucking  toilet seats again.  I want to sit down nice every morning.  No, he is busy.  He just started a new radio station here with his tailor.  And things are popping.  It's just amazing.  Sometimes we can't get guests because they're busy back in his office having a conversation 
[00:09:00]  with him.  I think The Rolling Stones had a song about that.  Oh, yeah?  Which one's that?  Wait a minute.  Let me think.  Think?  Let me think.  I can't say this one.  I'm brave.  I'm not this brave.  I'll write it down for fucking Ronnie, though.  Oh, that's the one you can never play on the radio, but Opie decided to play it once  on the radio.  Now, yes, you're absolutely Kevin from Connecticut.  It was part of the Pick Your Stones weekend up there in Buffalo where we had callers call 
[00:09:30]  in and you could pick whatever Rolling Stones song you want.  And they picked that one.  And I'd never heard the song before.  Couldn't you just went by the title and thought this isn't going to slide?  I think, Ronnie, if you know you're Rolling Stones, I think the song is actually that.  Okay.  Well, we're talking about a song called Star.  Star.  That has the word fucking fucker probably 200 times in it.  Well, you're being very vague now.  I don't give a fuck. 
[00:10:00]  Where is this going?  Well, where it's going is, so someone picks the song up in Buffalo, I start the record  and my intro was, oh, what a great song this is.  And then I turned down the monitor because I was flirting with some girl on the phone.  And they're playing this at a promotion, some kind of car show with the speakers on the  van.  And it's just cranking through the whole fucking thing.  Did you start hearing it and be like, hey, what are they playing?  Oh, shit, that's me.  What happened, and I believe his name is Mike Benson, was the jock that had to be on the 
[00:10:30]  scene.  He calls the hotline.  And I'm like, wow, that's weird.  Why is the hotline fucking ringing?  Oh, hold on, babe.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Yeah, yeah.  I pick up the phone.  And he's like, do you know what the fuck you're doing?  And I turned up the monitor.  And next thing you know, I almost had, I almost fucking, you know, passed out.  Thought that was the end of your career, man.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The first of many thought that was the end of their careers.  I had to kiss some major ass with the general manager at the time to save my job.  But we were under the radar, so it was never an FCC complaint. 
[00:11:00]  Even though you knew, like, you were wrong, and you were saying, yeah, I fucked up, did  he just keep going, why did you do that?  Because it's something big that they can yell at.  I just.  You gave him a reason.  I pleaded.  I said, I'd never heard this song before.  It's Pick Your Stones Weekend.  I figure, what the hell?  I didn't know Rolling Stones cursed like that.  Pre-listen to the music before you blah, blah.  Oh, I suck.  I know nothing about on air.  Hey, what is a better fucking gig to them?  Pick Your Stones Weekend.  How about a little creativity fucks? 
[00:11:30]  Give us something to work with.  Well, it was 20 years ago.  Pick Your Stones Weekend.  What was your worst fuck up on the air?  That was probably my worst fuck up on regular radio.  Well, my worst fuck up.  Well, actually, we might have had another one.  Well, yeah, later on in talk radio, I think we had a couple.  My worst fuck up ever is, hey, Fez, why don't you just move into that chair?  No.  And I'm just saying to somebody who's sobbing right now, Roosevelt Island, no, I'm just kidding. 
[00:12:00]  Just kidding.  He was peeking around the corner when we were asking you to do our show.  Was he?  And then I'm like, how do I handle this?  I like Fez, but I like different looks.  I wanted the Opie Anthony Ron look today.  Yeah, why not, right?  They call it the war show.  We saw him as we were pulling out of the garage yesterday, doing his laps around the building.  We saw him doing his laps.  It was, you know, it's like, oh, there's Fez.  We were doing Mystery Science Theater.  And it was, you know, him walking.  We were doing Mystery Science Theater.  And I think someone in the vehicle at the time might have, as he walks past us, go, look, look, fear, anxiety. 
[00:12:30]  What's going on?  Look at the road.  Look at the building.  What's happening?  Something's falling on me.  There's got to be a piano over my head.  There's change on the ground.  My father, give me change.  We were kind of, we had his dialogue.  It's not the most confident walk.  It's all hunched over.  No.  It's not.  Like something is about, he walks like something is about to happen at any second.  You wouldn't, it's like a, it's like a chihuahua before an earthquake. 
[00:13:00]  It's not this confident, you wouldn't call it a strut.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  You wonder why he doesn't get mugged a lot in New York because he looks like a victim.  He probably looks too much like a cop trying to get mugged because he's, you'd look and  go, no one actually walks like that.  That's true.  It's got to be.  Well, he does his laps before the Ron and Fears show.  Yeah.  So.  He gets himself together.  He, but he is concerned.  And plus it takes a lot to get him into that elevator.  It's like a, what about Bob moment for him every single day. 
[00:13:30]  Baby steps.  We thought, I love what about Bob, by the way, a movie people can talk about.  After that woman got killed in the elevator recently, uh, we, we actually said like, oh  my God, what are they going to do?  How are they getting him upstairs?  That had to be one of those things where he just did not want to get in.  You, you have to take the time and have a, have a ride with him because it's unbelievable  because it's like being in a Piper cup with a storm.  Like, do you notice that there's fucking sounds in the elevator? 
[00:14:00]  No.  Because I never do, but he hears them.  He hears every little.  He hears them.  For him, it's screws popping out of the bottom.  He just hears them.  It's the cable going.  Bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing.  But I have been like, well, you guys don't do it because no one would come to work when  you do.  But we have, you know, a bunch of other floors just so sometimes you get on the elevator  with a lot of people.  It's got to stop.  And he has to be in a certain part of the elevator or else it'll crash.  The safe place.  Yeah.  So he's back holding on. 
[00:14:30]  So when the floor falls out, he's going to be able to hold on to those guys.  Oh, my God.  So I look through like, like eight to ten people at him one day and I just see him sobbing  in the middle.  Oh, my God.  With a bunch of other people.  Oh, my God.  And I'm just like saying to people next to me, I go, what's with her?  She's fucking losing her shit over there.  Oh, poor Fez.  That's hilarious.  That sounds like hell on earth.  But even if the floor dropped out, do you think he'd be able to hold on and suck it up 
[00:15:00]  in a diehard moment, really, where he's got to crawl through the ceiling?  What's he going to do?  Not unless he's been working on his tries lately.  Yeah.  That's like a tricep exercise.  That's a tricep exercise.  So hold on while the floor gives away and you're holding on to the rail in the back of the elevator.  Yeah, that's a big one.  Kevin from Connecticut, the Rolling Stones song Star Star features the word fuck 59 times.  He just counted it.  Wow.  There you go.  Thank God.  What is it?  60 is the FCC complaint?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's it.  You're fine.  He's like, come on.  So you just skated. 
[00:15:30]  Ronnie was telling us, speaking of music, there was a buzz in the hallway yesterday.  Oh, God.  There's a buzz in the hallway.  What year is this?  Well, there's a lot of talk because the new Springsteen album has got everybody thrilled here.  And by everybody, you mean Roland.  Well, this is the sad thing, and this is because of you guys.  Everybody was invited to the listening party, but Roland.  Oh, shit.  Roland said, can I go to the listening party?  What?  Can I go to the listening party?  Why did they fucking do this to him? 
[00:16:00]  There was a whole management.  Everybody was at this long table, and they were all listening to the new Bruce.  Why bring the one guy that knows everything about Bruce?  And Roland was sitting in the office while it was happening.  They wouldn't invite him?  He knew what they were doing, too.  You understand every fifth word, Roland says.  Why did there actually be the new Bruce thing?  Who was in there that shouldn't have been in there?  All opera management was in there.  Well, they shouldn't be in there.  What do they know about music?  One person said that he enjoyed watching them through the glass window because of all the forced head nodding that was happening. 
[00:16:30]  It was the old school.  It was like they were on quick hooks.  It was like, fuck, yeah.  You know, just pulling at their hair, very short hair now.  Was someone playing air drums at the table, too?  Like, yeah, this is great.  I used to hate sitting in those sessions.  We've got to find a single off this album.  Yeah.  This is our job today, man.  Did you ever pick one?  Were you ever the guy who came through?  Not officially.  I only did it once. 
[00:17:00]  Really?  I only did it once, and it was Sweet Child O' Mine.  A little song called Sweet Child O' Mine.  I said to Charlie Logan, I go, we're on the wrong fucking song, dude.  Let's go over, turn it, Sweet Child O' Mine.  What song were they thinking?  I don't know, Mr. Brownstone or Welcome to the Jungle.  At the time, everything was changing.  It was a game changer, as we like to say.  It was a game changer.  And you picked a Sweet Child O' Mine.  I picked a Sweet Child O' Mine, and never again, never again was I ever able to say,  hey, this is the hit. 
[00:17:30]  Boy, the next one, you must have been very confident.  Oh, yeah.  Thinking, I can do this.  Yeah.  You know, I love talking about old radio with Ronnie, because this goes back to when program  directors actually picked their own music for their own station.  And then you fast forward a few years, and then it was literally five guys across the  country picking the music for every single radio station.  The guy over at KRQ in L.A.  Right, right, right.  Oedipus was a guy.  Yeah, K-Rock in L.A.'s playing this, so we gotta. 
[00:18:00]  PCN's playing this, so we gotta.  Yeah, that's the real pussies that would do that, just try to piggyback on somebody else's  here.  That's when the business started becoming shit, and that's when you had to start talking  for a living, or you were going to be fucked over.  And this is also the part of business that Sam left.  I don't understand.  There's record guys that would fucking take you to the best steakhouse, fucking, you know.  On the strip clubs.  Right.  So.  A few bumps in the bathroom.  Maybe a hooker here and there.  Yeah.  We always used to say, this one doesn't smell like a hit.  I don't know, maybe I'm wrong. 
[00:18:30]  But, you know.  Give it a listen.  You do that thing of, there's only an album in here.  Seems a little late to get airplay.  Right up to day party.  Day party.  Holy shit.  Remember day party?  Wow.  Then some songs were.  We've been in this a while.  Then some songs were fucking too rockin'.  I'm just dumbing it down for people.  Were too fucking rock and roll for, like, midday.  So they would day party, meaning, you know, you had to start playing it at six or seven 
[00:19:00]  o'clock at night.  That's the night guy.  And then if you were the asshole that said, fuck that and played it earlier, all hell would  break loose.  What are you doing?  And it was really stuff like Metallica would be like, oh, you can't play that during the  day.  Yeah.  That's nighttime.  That's for the fucking.  People are in their office now.  They're working.  They can't listen to that.  Right.  Remember that?  Yeah.  You were going to fuck up what was called workplace listening.  Workplace listening.  Turn that off.  Right.  I hear guitar. 
[00:19:30]  You know what?  I want to write a book, but we should write a book.  Fuck.  Like a bunch of us.  And we'll call it No One Cares But Us.  We'll be the name of it.  Because there are guys that have tried to do that.  Like, you know, when they'll write the old N.E.W. book or, you know, the We Were Free  Forum radio book.  Yeah.  But they put the rose-colored glasses on.  Yeah.  Right.  Fuck that.  But every jock buys it.  Right.  And that's about it.  Because no one else gives a shit. 
[00:20:00]  Because...  Earl buys a copy.  Yeah.  Because this is fascinating.  Because they romanticize it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All those asshole old jocks that think it still matters what music you're playing during  your show.  Are there really people like that left at this point?  Yes.  Yes.  That actually think the same way you had to think back in 85.  The PLJ and N.E.W. days.  Yeah.  They're down there.  They're right down the hall.  They're still down the hall.  They're down the hall.  Hoping that's coming back.  Rocking to the new Bruce song and saying...  Wait.  So where are we going to put...  So the hallways were a buzz because of Bruce Springsteen?  Everywhere.  Like Ronnie said, I don't want to... 
[00:20:30]  He's put out 17 albums now.  Everyone who's a boss here...  And my boss...  Everybody who's management here.  Oh.  That's what I meant.  And my Bruce.  Loves Bruce Springsteen.  And what is that going to do for the company?  They're trying to get him in here, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can we put something out?  A sticker or some shirts?  We need something that ties us together.  We want to own Bruce.  By the way.  Sirius XM needs to own Bruce.  By the way, do we have a...  Oh, God.  Shut up.  Do we have a shredder in this joint?  Because we're all writing notes.  I know.  I'm not. 
[00:21:00]  I'm stuck in my pocket with notes already.  I just decided not to write my desk with that exact book.  There are secret notes going back and forth.  And I'm making the J.  And like, who's listening?  My star fucker notes going in my pocket.  No one's pointing out one.  There are notes written on napkins.  This is like a fucking CIA meeting.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But what are they going to do with the Springsteen?  They were just trying to...  Isn't there a single that the...  I mean, we played the single yesterday.  What is it?  It's called Dancing in the Dark 2.  Yeah.  It's fucking really good. 
[00:21:30]  I think we played it yesterday.  Is it Back Into the Tunnel of Love?  Yes.  I like how they do that.  Yes.  Like, Back Into Hell.  Right.  Back Outta Hell.  I love that.  This is born to rest.  It's just...  Well, I don't know why he has a new song, but he's talking about New Orleans like it just  fucking happened.  Oh, really?  Like, what are we going to do?  What?  With those people.  What happened?  What is this?  That's ancient history now.  What happened?  We're running against Bush again.  There's no Obama.  And this song, is he going to make believe he's a working class guy again? 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, back in Jersey.  A blue-collar guy.  I'm in Asbury Park, Wendy.  Let's all ignore...  What?  Are you still?  Let's all ignore that he's in a $20 million mansion somewhere in Jersey that he can't even  find on Google Maps.  Well, the maids didn't show up in my parlor's dirty.  And someone took a billiard ball off the table.  What's so important?  What's so important?  Your notebook has to stay in front of you.  Oh, look at him.  He's got his notes.  What are you taking notes, Sam?  I write down what happens on the show. 
[00:22:30]  What?  Just write nothing.  It's the exact opposite of radio, what you're doing right now.  You're in school.  You're going to be...  He's going to write a tell-all book this month.  Yeah, you know he is.  Bad shit about Opie, he's going to call it.  Fucking nude sex wife.  He's going to fuck us eventually.  This song is all right, but it's not going to change things.  The Springsteen channel is one of the high-profile channels here.  Why?  So we're already locked in.  We don't have to listen to anything.  Just put it on. 
[00:23:00]  Why isn't his picture out in the lobby?  Instead of the book radio lady.  All right, look.  That fucking show's good, though.  Book radio?  You like that?  Yeah.  I gave it a listen, and I'm hooked.  They don't even finish the books.  No, we learned.  If you're going to have a book radio, finish a book.  That's like playing half a song.  You go, play the rest at your home.  At your house.  Well, they do a day part, too.  So at night, you can listen to the cunt in the hat.  I mean, that's suggestive.  It's like, I think this book's a little too macabre for middays. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, we can't do that.  Fucking Ronnie's making us do radio today.  Well, what do you normally do?  What happens?  We're a bit more hyper, high energy.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I think we're trying to impress Ronnie over here.  It is true.  Let's tone it down a little bit here.  I want you to write something down in your notebook there for today.  Sam?  Meals for feels.  We're really going to find him.  Or feels for meals.  Which one?  Whatever it is.  That's the dream.  It is the dream.  That's the mark that we have to hit.  Supposedly, they're going to allow us to do it now, right?  No, but it's a bastardized version. 
[00:24:00]  This is something we've been trying to get done for over 10 years.  It's very simple.  It's very simple.  Big refrigerator box.  Two holes cut in it.  Two holes cut in the box.  Have a chick that's topless in the box.  You come up with a donation of a canned food thing during the holidays.  You put it down.  You shove your hands in the holes.  You feel her tits.  You move on.  Right.  It's brilliantly 1990.  But for some reason, we couldn't do it.  No.  And now they're saying we can do it, but it's different. 
[00:24:30]  It's got to be done in the fishbowl where everything's done now.  When we need a huge crowd of 10, we go to the fishbowl.  And I think they're going to allow 20 people up.  20 people that are pre-screened that it won't offend anybody.  And then the chick's got to wear a parka.  Right.  Or something.  They shove their hands in and feel some fucking down.  Sure.  I love it when they put you guys in the fishbowl and then they surround it with paper.  It's no longer a fishbowl.  It's not a fishbowl.  Yeah.  It's a fishbowl with gunk on the side.  You know when you used to have to take that razor blade and scrape your fishbowl? 
[00:25:00]  They took our amazing studio away.  But they're like, but we have the fishbowl.  Don't worry about it, guys.  But instead of having listeners just come and go, it's like, no, we've got to control this.  I loved it.  They gave us 12 seats.  When that studio was like Wonderama when we were over there, there's the bleacher seating  and a peanut gallery.  It was great.  I think that's when I officially gave up.  What, we lost that?  Yeah.  I was like, what are you going to do?  That was fantastic.  Now let's just watch the clock.  This room with this fucking black wallpaper is actually depressing. 
[00:25:30]  Really?  It is.  This is like being an Iron Maiden's fucking rehearsal studio.  It just has a...  But some nice lights would help that.  Yeah, the lighting's awful.  It's just dingy.  Shondis yellow.  Yeah.  It just feels like 12 monkeys.  It's like the fucking future scenes of 12 monkeys.  I wish I knew...  I wish I...  Hey, Bob.  Gonna do a radio show today, Bob?  Yeah, we're gonna do a radio show. 
[00:26:00]  I wish I knew who we could talk to about this.  Yeah.  I've talked to everyone I thought I could talk to about it, so I don't know.  It's done.  There's nothing that's gonna change in here.  One of the filters fell off.  They don't even care about that.  Don't turn on the lights.  That's an atomic fucking pile.  This one doesn't work at all, right?  No, that's just...  No, it works, but it gives you headaches.  Can I turn on the lights?  That, like, gives you headaches.  Huh?  Can I turn on the lights?  You wanna give it...  Yeah, yeah.  Turn the lights on.  Those are the ones...  These are the ones they gave us when we have guests in, so that if we're videotaping or  taking pictures, it just looks a little brighter and a little...  Oh, Jesus. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, God.  ...and a little better.  It's, um...  And that one doesn't even work anymore?  Oh, Mars.  Of course.  What happened, Mars?  We haven't turned it on in a while.  Yeah.  Don't look into it.  It might come on.  So, this is nice, though.  So, when a guest comes in, he feels like he's being x-rayed.  I mean, it's just...  Yeah.  It's like...  Prepare you for the cancer years.  Give him a clean bill of help on his way out.  What is that?  This is the logic, though.  They're like, this is good.  You guys could work with this, right?  Yeah, that's not too distracting, is it?  We should probably get enough of those to spell it Lady Gaga, because it looks like some 
[00:27:00]  bad tour.  It looks like Kiss.  Yeah.  When Kiss fucking flashes the Kiss sign.  You wanted the best!  You got the best!  It's horrible.  It is fucking terrible.  It's mind-boggling.  Eric Logan would have never allowed this if he didn't run away from us.  And when you ask them down the hall, that's what we asked for.  Hey, that's what you asked for.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  This cube of lights?  Fucking light bright at nuclear strength. 
[00:27:30]  Should we shine the lights down the hall again today, Sam?  That is good.  We just leave it.  We put them in that window once when they first got us off, and just shine them down the  hallway.  And they get really pissed.  So when they walk up, they know what it's like to have to stare into these things.  I really think these are lights that you see on runways.  I'm not even...  Yeah, that is true.  I just looked at this light for two seconds.  I can't even see your face.  Yeah, yeah.  Dude, I can't even see your face.  Blink, it's cool.  It's like a cheap buzz.  Have you turned it on in front of guests?  No.  Have you ever attempted it?  No.  Never.  We'd be embarrassed.  Too embarrassing. 
[00:28:00]  But they think this is good.  We're going to have the likes of a David Duchovny staring to those fucking...  David Duchovny.  Well, I've never, sir.  Oh, my goodness.  I was on the X-Files for the love of fuck.  What am I doing here looking at these lights?  With all the guys that got fired from regular radio, I'm just amazed that these are the  people that survived.  I'm amazed.  They're the cockroaches.  Do you know how many really talented radio guys are on beaches right now?  Do you know how delicate the praying mantis is?  Holy fuck.  They're delicate.  The cockroach, on the other hand, they live through anything. 
[00:28:30]  That's what they are down there.  The cockroach.  We are the last bastion of praying mantis.  Elegant.  Graceful.  Amazing.  So the Springsteen album, huh?  So their whole goal is to get Springsteen to do an hour in the fishbowl?  Well, they're also just, like, that's the one guy they're legitimate fans of.  Yeah, but who cares?  So they go crazy for him.  What about Southside Johnny?  They don't fucking have any time for him?  Are the Asperi Jukes still there?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  They're still rocking, right?  I was in a bar next to my house last night. 
[00:29:00]  We're having a party.  Turn it down.  320 pounds.  People are trying to sleep.  But now they've got to do having a party on a much lower volume.  Hey, everybody.  Who knows?  Maybe tonight Bruce will stop in.  Oh, no.  Did he stop in one time?  Yeah.  They promote it as special guests.  And tell Ronnie.  Oh, I hear Bruce is showing them.  Tell Ronnie Sir Morgan's Cove.  The Sir Morgan's Cove story.  No, that was the one with the AAF.  Because you just brought back a memory. 
[00:29:30]  This venue was famous in Worcester, Mass.  They would have bands and stuff like that, local Worcester guys.  And then occasionally they'd have like any name.  Every city has one.  Yeah, every city's got one of these.  And they would promote, hey, this is where the Rolling Stones played.  The Stones played here.  It was one of those weird things that happened where the Stones dropped in for whatever reason.  In 1983.  If that.  I think it was.  Who knows?  Maybe.  And they were still promoting it like, hey, this is where the Stones. 
[00:30:00]  In every commercial.  This is where the Stones played.  Just continue to try.  It's like when a comic has their fucking credits on.  Right.  As heard on the Arsenio Hall show.  Wow.  Yeah, he cracked Jack Parr up.  Like the Stones are going to show up again.  Yeah, you never know.  And every other big band coming through was there.  There's a special secret guest this evening.  Right.  They would hint that maybe.  Is it Soft White Underbelly?  Right.  I hear Soft White Underbelly's playing.  It's Blue Airsta Cult.  It's Blue Airsta Cult. 
[00:30:30]  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  I remember when Blue Airsta Cult played in Huntington.  And I was like, wow, this is cool.  They're playing in that place right down the street from the restaurant there.  From Riley's.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Yeah, that place.  Yeah, it was the theater.  Right.  The old 99-cent theater.  Right.  And they were playing there.  And I was all psyched.  Like, yeah, I'm going to see Blue Airsta Cult.  And it was well after there.  For sure.  They had peaked with, you know, don't fear the reaper.  And I went in there.  And I could carry on a normal conversation with the person next to me right in the middle  of Emmy 262. 
[00:31:00]  Five guitar armies going on.  And I'm sitting there going, wow, they really have turned it down, haven't they?  Yes, they have.  The five guitar armies.  I'm like, what happened?  This should be blowing my ears out.  But everyone's sitting.  That's when you realize, I think I'm getting up there.  Yeah.  I think I'm getting up there.  By the way, they're still playing local gigs.  Oh, I know.  You know when I really knew it was over?  When they actually asked my brother to play bass guitar.  It was like, literally, my brother met with Buck Darman.  Well, your brother's talented.  He's a talented guy. 
[00:31:30]  He's a talented guy.  But there are many talented guys that don't get the chance to sit there, audition, and get  the gig with Blue Airsta Cult.  And it's like, ah.  It's one thing to have a childhood dream.  But it should never really come true.  It shouldn't come true.  It should never really come true.  We used to fucking listen to Blue Airsta Agents of Fortune.  And we'd listen to this shit and just be like, this is the best.  We're rocking it.  And then fast forward.  There's Joe with the guys going, yeah, I know that one.  Right. 
[00:32:00]  Why didn't he get the gig?  What?  Why didn't he get the gig?  He was too tall.  No.  Abso-fucking-lutely.  Well, those guys are really short.  They are so far.  They are like three stooges small.  They are very short guys.  I had no idea of this.  And Joe was much too tall to be the bass player in the back and just tower over.  They actually called him and said that to him?  They love him.  They still love him.  Like, Joe fucking hangs out with him.  So how about they make like a little stage thing?  Oh, put him in a ditch?  Yeah, put him in a little ditch or something. 
[00:32:30]  Or they could stand on boxes like the black guy from Green Mile.  Yeah.  Like, nah.  But he was too tall for the gig.  Wow.  Yeah.  He knew everything.  He'd been playing the shit forever.  He knew every song.  Yeah.  But that's when I knew, though.  I was like, wait a minute.  Blois the Cult is on a high.  Oh, here's this.  Wait, what's this, Sam?  Where's Blois the Cult playing?  No, no.  Oh, I thought you had their dates.  What's this?  This is in Worcester, right?  The Lucky Dog?  Is that the old Sir Morgan's Cove?  It must be because there's a...  How do you change the name? 
[00:33:00]  No, there's a Rolling Stones link.  There's a link right on the side that says Rolling Stones.  And then it says, in 1981, the Rolling Stones played a surprise concert at the Lucky Dog Music Hall at the time, Sir Morgan's Cove.  Oh, wow.  They are still doing it.  We've been out of Boston for, I don't even know now.  There's the pics, Mick.  And this was back when he was wearing football pants.  Remember that was the one tour, the Tattoo New tour, where he, for some reason, acted like he was fucking Joe Montana? 
[00:33:30]  You know why?  He was turning 40.  Oh, is that right?  And it was a big deal.  People were like, holy fuck, Mick Jagger's 40.  Can he still rock that old?  This guy's done.  He only has a year or two left in his career.  No one goes past 40 in rock and roll.  31 fucking years ago.  And they're thinking about going on tour again to celebrate 50 years, I think.  And they'll fucking sell it out.  Yep.  They will sell it out.  I remember the football pants days.  Do you realize, from the time that the Stones played there till now, if you went from then backwards, it was before the Stones were even fucking together. 
[00:34:00]  Well, you're talking about 1951, sir.  51.  You could vividly remember Hitler.  49.  Vividly remember Hitler.  They were closer to Hitler than you are to 9-11.  That's how people are still having fucking Hitler anxieties.  Like, I don't want it to happen again.  You know, I just, I don't like to be in a cramped room.  Exactly.  Like, that's all fun until you start doing it with your age.  I'm closer to, I'm closer to 60, I'm 30.  I'm closer to dead than I was fucking in fifth grade. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah, the middle-aged thing is a lie.  First of all, did you even expect to be this old?  Nah.  Never.  I was shocked.  I was shocked at 21.  How did this happen to me?  I used to do the math, like, when I was, honestly, when I was probably eight or nine years old,  I'd be like, when I'm, like, 40, and you get up there and realize what year it is,  and you just expect Jetsons, like, cars are going to be flying by, we're all in Mylar suits.  Eating pills and nothing else.  Yes, exactly.  And then you get that age, and you look around, and there's still telephone poles and cars, 
[00:35:00]  and people are still assholes.  We're not Vulcans.  We have emotion.  What happened?  We got tablets.  Well, we do have the iPod and the iTouch and the iPad.  And now Apple's saying that textbooks are going to go away.  What?  Yeah.  That's preposterous.  They're taking out the textbook industry.  Did you hear that on book radio?  I heard it on book radio.  Book radio?  They're done.  They're fucking panicking over there. 
[00:35:30]  They don't know what to do.  They're having a meeting down the hall.  Well, they don't know what to do.  No, I mean, it's a good thing.  Yeah.  Well, but, you know, to go back to the music thing that's so weird is the fact that we still  pay attention to music from 1967, which is well over 40 years ago.  Wow, yeah.  But people in 67 were not listening to music from the 20s and still talking about it.  Yes.  That would just be gone.  Like, even, like, in 67, they weren't talking about the 50s.  Right.  Like, Chuck Berry and Jerry Lee Lewis couldn't find work. 
[00:36:00]  Done.  You know?  Yeah, it was all about...  We were all programmed, because that's all radio played over and over again.  But it's just...  No, it's a mindset, too.  But what happened...  It's some weird things.  But if you think about it, I'm trying to think what year, like, from 19, let's call  it 90 to maybe the turn of the century, all those artists and those songs, they're not  being played anywhere.  You know what I mean?  So the 90s are gone, but the 60s and 70s are still here.  That's what's weird.  How does that work?  If I go back to Long Island and I turn it on BAB, they're still playing the exact same  fucking playlist than when I was there well over 20 years ago. 
[00:36:30]  It's like a Twilight Zone.  That's weird.  But all the stuff that kind of came out 90 and after, they'll pick maybe just a couple.  Pearl Jam gets to stay.  Yeah, they get to stay.  Maybe a little Nirvana, maybe a little Alice in Chains.  But all those other bands that were doing all right in that era, there's no place for  that.  That's why SiriusXM, the one thing they did do right was the classic Rewind.  All those fucking groups and songs that kind of fell through the cracks.  Do you remember though, I remember growing up when the oldies station was nothing but 
[00:37:00]  ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bang-a-bang-a-bang for years.  And then all of a sudden it turned into like fucking 70s and 80s music.  And now you can't find fucking ba-ba-ba-ba-bang.  That's done on regular radio.  but that's just it  it's done  but it was there for a year  for decades  I got some guys coming in on my show  that have been around for 50 years  they're called the Persuaders  and they do like Grateful Dead songs  in that style  in the oldie kind of 
[00:37:30]  and they've been around during their 70s  and shit and they're just great  I don't know everything that they do  I don't know the whole shit  I'm just going to let them do their stuff  but I just think it's fucking hysterical  it is an odd twist on Grateful Dead  today  you're doing two shows today?  are you insane?  you are the Iron Man of radio  I don't know how to tell you this  but everyone else works 8 hours a day in America  that's crazy  I can't even imagine it 
[00:38:00]  if I'm not home in bed by 10.40  I feel like I'd put an OT  I mean guys that lift couches and shit  work 8 hours  aren't there people for that?  people do that?  I thought they'd just get people  and we'd bitch about a 4 hour day  yeah  oops  but they're not doing what you're doing  they don't have the ability  to have people bring them coffee  they don't have a club soda Kenny?  there's no fucking Oscar winners  to come in  and carry the weight for a while  yeah come on 
[00:38:30]  it's easy right?  we get mad when we have to walk down the sidewalk  to the cars  I don't like that  we don't like that  unless my car's pulled up downstairs  unless I see Kenny's gorgeous face  behind the wheel of my escalade  I feel like I got  I was like  oh I gotta walk to the fucking garage now  you know where  you know where you should go sometime  you should go to New York  really you should  I should take a look  I don't think  I hear it's exciting  I don't think Anthony  has ever really seen New York  you're right  you're here every day 
[00:39:00]  he asked me the other day  where 52nd Street was  oh that's way the hell uptown right?  that's near Harlem  now did you hear about Bloomberg's bet?  what he's  he's bet our street here  49th Street  did he bet the whole street?  yeah  and we will be called  if we lose against San Francisco  49ers Street  oh no  that's where we will now work  now that's  that's crazy  and then he sent him bagels  yeah that Bloomberg is  wow  he's a creative  he's a wild man  he's crazy 
[00:39:30]  wow I didn't even know this  if the Giants lose  he's going to smoke  a carton of cigarettes  that's the fucking  that's the angle  yeah  I uh  I don't go for those  city against city  football bet things  we will send you  a fresh  New England  wine  oh here they go  it's Boston  they're sending some chowder  yeah  they're sending some chowder  and San Francisco  is just going to send  cock  they're just going to send  some cock over  you could pick this  and you know  it's going to be  sourdough bread 
[00:40:00]  you just know what it is  Philadelphia's  a cheesesteak  steaks coming  cheesesteaks  Baltimore  crab cakes  it's like it's still  all they have  yeah  you don't do cheesesteaks  in New York City  right Ronnie  no I wouldn't fucking  dream of it  because now I'm a  cheesesteak guy  that's got to be  hack though in New York  as soon as we get  terrible  as soon as we get  where do you go for it  uh just local really  there's not one spot  where do you go  for hoagies down there  uh I'm not a hoagie guy  as much as a cheesesteak guy  I know everyone has their place  we just go local  right up the street  cheesesteaks are terrible  no they're 
[00:40:30]  oh yeah  well yeah  yeah it's like awfulness  well thank god I don't live  down there  but when we visit  we gotta get our cheesesteak  either coming into town  or leaving town  most of the people  that live in Philly  die by the age of 30  is that the average  yeah but mainly  it's still angel dust  accidents  after all these years  it has nothing to do  with cheesesteak  I think buffalo is  like an angel dust  or a shooting  perhaps  I think buffalo is more  or is way more unhealthy  with the wings  the wings  fuck yeah  the guy that invented them  died at 50 
[00:41:00]  of a major  fucking heart attack  have you ever had like  even like cheese bread  in fucking buffalo  everything they have  is just like so  but here's what I love  yeah  just cheese  and oil  and grease  inside of  they have fish fry  Fridays up there  and they have buffalo wings  they have to be way  more unhealthy  Philly's known for the  hoagies and the  cheesesteak  that's about it  I think  and the pretzels  scrapple  oh god yeah  I only discovered  pork roll 
[00:41:30]  within the last two years  that's a Jersey thing  is it  really  so Philly's stealing that  what is it  what's the difference  between pork roll  and just fucking pork  one comes in a roll  put that in a roll  there's probably cheese  in the middle right  they've figured out  how to make it even more  more unhealthy  unhealthy basically  oh man  pork roll with some eggs  forget it  but really  how long do you want to live  you're right  at the end of the day  that is true  I'd rather have a quality  than quantity  yeah  you want to go out  like Butch Cassidy  and his son dancing  yeah  just come out that door  blazing  blazing 
[00:42:00]  hopefully there's a freeze frame  and that'll be it  yeah  Bolivian army's out there  waiting for you  with a cheesesteak  is Roland here yet  he's gonna have a lot to say  about the Bruce Springsteen  listening party  I can't wait to hear  oh man he's gonna be pissed  who figured out Roland yesterday  it's fucking brilliant  the panda  Tom Papa  Tom Papa comes in  and he goes  Roland is the panda bear  is a panda  that attacks  he looks all cuddly  and nice  and puts that front out  but if you get close  to the cage  he starts pulling  your jacket off  and trying to rip  your fucking head off  this is Roland  and you sit there going

[00:43:00]  look at it  it's fucking mad  look at him  but do you know  that Roland can attack  oh yeah  we've seen him  there you go  we've seen him crying  but he'll run at you  crying and fucking claw you  and then claw you  the first time  we ever saw Roland  go after someone  it was Master Poe  and we were like  oh Roland's  Roland's gonna be a pushover  Poe's gonna tear him apart  and then he was  the nastiest  just didn't care  what he said  how insulting  and hurtful it was  that's Roland  the cute panda  that'll rip your fucking head off  something happened to him  when he was a kid 
[00:43:30]  there's no fucking doubt  you think it was touched  yeah it was just  a fucking train  I mean it wasn't  just fucking  a train  yeah it could have been  hours are going by  he's fucking  covered in cum  and blood  you think all the uncles  got together  I said look  I know what you're into  I'm into it too  that's why they fucking  buttered him up  it was a real  mattress flipper  the buffalo people  are screaming  the beef on the  on the wick up there  oh it's unbelievable  what is beef on the wick  I don't remember 
[00:44:00]  it's a very  it's a long roll  with shitty beef  yeah but it's a bit like  a salty  no it's really fucking delicious  and then they dip  they dip the bread  and fucking gravy  and yeah  but buffalo is weird  because it's almost like  they're one of the few  cities left  they haven't been  genderfied at all  they've got their own  culture  that's not like  everywhere else  right  you know it's like  the fucking lost island  but colder and sadder  they still believe  in the steel industry  up there  yeah they think  it's coming back  oh yeah 
[00:44:30]  it's gonna make a big comeback  they haven't taken down  these factories  they're just waiting  for the time  to all turn around  truckloads of I-beams  just flying out of the place  oh yeah  ain't gonna happen  I think buffalo  most unhealthiest city  I'm trying to think  what other cities  we gotta throw in there  like Pittsburgh  Pittsburgh  but what are they known for  steel  but people are leaving  there too  I mean  they've scattered  but you may  people don't leave  buffalo though  fucking Detroit  is awful now  but that's unhealthy  for other reasons  any of the  auto industry 
[00:45:00]  cities are like  anything that's industry  but we're talking  about food  food wise  oh I was just  talking like  when the black people  moved in  well Detroit  is gonna declare  bankruptcy as a city  really  that was on the news  two days ago  yeah  anyone who actually  used to work  for a living  is in trouble  and you know  what you really  need to do now  is market as a job  you know what I mean  like marketing  what are you marketing  exactly  you're marketing stuff  other people made  and you're selling  them to other countries  right  yeah  so nothing's 
[00:45:30]  really being made  no  there's no more  you know  pank  pank the sound  effects from  Allentown  right  pank  pank  pank  yeah that song  doesn't make sense  anymore  no  what are these  noises  we haven't heard  those in 20 years  we're working  here in cubicles  that's the way  guys are now  we're thinking  outside of the box  they're gonna  green light my idea  in my neighborhood  where I grew up  that you would go  to the fucking 
[00:46:00]  your friends houses  and their dad's  work boots  were always in the  back  they could never  wear their boots  all dirty  yeah  they could never  wear their boots  inside  yeah  you're like  what are these  fucking men  do  what's my future  gonna be like  tar on there  and fucking  metal  melted  molten steel  dried up on the  heels  they're just  building the city  oh yeah  very busy  the other weird  thing is like  fucking kids  there was always  a chance that  our dads would  die at work  you know what I mean  it would be like  it was an explosion 
[00:46:30]  today  we lost Hank  you'd come home  we gotta go to  Hank's wake  your dad would be  sitting in the dark  smoking a cigarette  and you're thinking  maybe he's sobbing  a little bit  what happened  your mom would be like  oh don't bring up  there was trouble  today at work  trouble at work  yeah  what happened there  unless you're a cop  or a fireman now  right  you know that's the only  time people have to  worry  it's not like  you're gonna be  fucking in a cubicle  and a ceiling tile  is gonna hit you wrong  but guys would just  get pulled through  machines  you know  through extruders 
[00:47:00]  just be the  fucking end of them  we all knew at least  one person that  was missing a limb  or at least a finger  and none of them  could hear  none of them  you know like  our dads are like  really old  like at 40  you know  they would just be  doing shots  and drinking  and really  oh Christ  I don't know  if people know this  but they used to drink  out of really small  beer glasses back then  just old guys  with the tiniest  little glasses  would just be so  bummed out  it was tragic man 
[00:47:30]  fucking tragic  a lot of the guys  had a shake to them  yeah they would be  all fucked up  from it  just a little shake  coughing up asbestos  in their lungs  you know just  trying to provide  for their family  mesothelioma  wasn't even a word  it was just the fucking  he had the cancer  now we got the cubicles  you got the church key  opening up those  big metal steel  seamed beer cans  of Schaefer  yeah  the good old days  but they were so  and they would  fist fight and shit 
[00:48:00]  I mean they were  fucking  well here's  when you  did you ever see  that thing about  the Flyers in the 70s  oh fuck yeah  just what the town  itself was like  oh yeah  that the fucking town  was much tougher  than the Flyers  are today  like the Flyers  today's Flyers  could probably  be beat by  the 1973 audience  you know  in a fist fight  because they would  just fucking  hit each other  yeah  they would punch  the shit out  of each other  and there wasn't  any 
[00:48:30]  there really wasn't  cops being called  and shit like that  it just happened  or when the cops  were called  they were like  break this up  come on  break it up  knock it off  they didn't write  anyone up  Bobby  Bobby  come over here  let me talk to you  yeah  puts his arm around  him  what are you doing  what the fuck  are you doing  I gotta fucking  come down here  for this shit  and the cop  would be like  alright get out  of here  the Flyers  of the 70s  and the city  matched perfectly  right  holy fuck  people were just  crushing  that's why  when like fucking  when Rocky  came out  it was like  a documentary  yes 
[00:49:00]  of course  he's never  gonna win  he's never  gonna fucking  win  and then they  got fake  after that  but the original  Rocky  where the guy  came close  but didn't get it  was Philly  right  that's it  you're not quite  gonna get there  you're gonna get  your ass handed  to you  the end  because Philly  was always used  to that  being in the  shadow of  New York  when I  when I saw  Rocky  and fucking  it was the last  scene  everybody's going  crazy  a guy yelled out  you're never  gonna beat that end 
[00:49:30]  and the  people were like  yeah he's right  he's not gonna  fucking win  it's not gonna  happen  there's no good  could ever come  out of this  don't try  I'm here to tell you  they're still running  up those stairs  too  of course they are  they never stopped  running up those stairs  tourist attraction  right  every place  has a duck boat  now there's footprints  footprints too  in Wyoming  has duck boats  what the fuck  they got the  footprints at the  top of the stairs  where Mr. Stallone  did he put the  footprints in  the city did 
[00:50:00]  you know  his tiny little  size six feet  exactly  but did he do it  or did they just  get some guy  to step in some  cement and  I don't know  I didn't pay too  close attention  I did see  footprints though  like yeah this  is the spot  where he actually  jumped up and  down  for 700 bucks  Stallone will come  sing karaoke at  your house  feel it strong  now  feel it strong  now  everyone runs up  the damn stairs  and you realize  it was really not  much of a big deal  really  pretty easy to do  it looked pretty  hard when he did it 
[00:50:30]  wow  that was movie magic  pumping his arms  in the air  well they're tiny  little stairs  you can trip on  them  they're like  oh you gotta  like  you can't really  they're girls stairs  look how flat  the stairs are  they made it look  like it was  steep and long  it's a total  elevation of about  10 feet  yeah I think so  wow yeah  that guy made it  up pretty easy  well I guess  after all the  running he did  you're supposed  to think  oh that's  the finale  I would love  to know  if they have  a number  of how many  guys dropped  dead of a heart  attack  on the stairs 
[00:51:00]  there he goes  he tried it  you gotta think  there's at least  a few  he went out  doing what  he wanted  to do  running up  the rocky  stairs  he went up  the rocky  stairs  god bless  him  the weird  thing too  that every  town is a  tourist destination  now  like there  wasn't any  double decker  buses when  you guys  used to come  into New York  no no  it was just  those big  fucking  the odd  couple  buses  I remember  like in  Philly on a  class trip  we'd go  see the  fucking bell  right the 
[00:51:30]  liberty bell  we actually  could climb  on it  they would  let the  kids  it was just  the bell  sitting in  the room  we were just  like kicking it  writing shit  on it  you know now  they treat it  like it's a big  deal  you know like  you can't get  close to it  it's not worth  going  you're like  I think there's a  bell in there  we were sitting  on top of the  bell  let's see how many  of us we can get  on this bell  we were so bored  that's hilarious  you know everything  is an attraction  it is  there's double  deck of buses  there's those  duck tour buses 
[00:52:00]  yeah  now every city  thinks they  have something  special  I've never been  to the top of  the Empire State  Building  I was there  recently  first time  ever  the fucked up  thing is  though  yeah it's great  you would think  I'd never been  to the Statue of  Liberty  it was freezing  you could go there  every fucking day  you could see  the whole city  you could see  you know I saw  Jersey from the top  of the Empire State  I'm not kidding  I'm not kidding  I actually was  online to go to  the Empire State  Building  this is recently  and this is when 
[00:52:30]  my girl was still  living in California  so she's in New York  and I'm like  ah you gotta go  to the Empire State  Building  she's got a camera  she wanted to  take pictures  so I'm online  and I guess I'm  the only one  that really has  to deal with this  but I look up  and it says  no firearms  allowed in the  Empire State  I'm like  alright look  we gotta take a walk  I gotta go  voucher my gun  at a precinct  oh  her eyes are like  wait a minute  what  you gotta voucher  your what  why didn't you  just put it  behind a bush  and be back  in a little while  stash it  should I have 
[00:53:00]  stashed it  around school  I actually had  to go to a precinct  did you have to  walk through  a metal detector  yeah they got  metal detectors  I'm online  looking at the  metal detector  going  fuck man  I can't do this  they're gonna  you know  give me some shit  so I had to  get off the line  and go to a precinct  and the cops are  hilarious  alright  here's a nice one  we got hollow points  in this thing  yeah this is a nice one  yeah alright  now come back  whenever you want  come back  yeah  there was a woman  did you like it up there  or did you  it was fucking

[00:55:30]  kids at the  time  and it was  right when  the second  gulf war  started up  and I was  glued to the  television  you know  you're seeing  bombings live  it's fantastic  and I  remember  sitting up  in the  living room  and oh  look we  got  here  and a  fucking  VCR  tape goes  in  of like  fucking  what's that  one with  the big  furry  blue guy  the one  with the  doors  where the  fucking  monsters  inc  monsters

[00:57:00]  his hair  was highlighted  blonde  we made  fun of this  when it  came out  we're like  holy shit  that's E-Rock  wow  just consuming  consuming  consuming  people love  fucking adults  love these movies  yeah  do you think  that's a throwback  to  oh boy  Roland  the panda bears  coming  do you think  that's a throwback  to like  wanting to  reclaim  some childhood  shit  or  I don't know  I mean  everybody's  Michael Jackson  I guess  yeah  everyone's  fucking  Michael Jackson  I didn't have  a childhood  no one had  a childhood  I remember  riding a bike 
[00:57:30]  right  with my friends  riding bikes  and at that  point all you  want to do  is get older  right  all you wanted  to do  was fucking  grow up  and now  you're like  oh I wish  I was fucking  11  it's a race  to 21  it's a race  to 21  and then after  21 you kind of  want to put the  brakes on  right  but it goes  faster than  ever  right  you know  we're getting  so old  we don't even  want to race  to Friday  anymore  no  it's pretty much  let's just  slow down  this Tuesday  a little bit  how about a long  week  hold on to 
[00:58:00]  every moment  cherish it  cherish it  because I remember  the days  like oh I can't  wait for Friday  I'm not in that  fucking game  anymore  you know  Friday can wait  here's the other  thing I think  that we fuck  with our own  heads though  is like  when you're  fucking 13  you don't feel  like you're  going to ever  be 20  but when you're  fucking 33  you're like  I'm almost  40  I'm a fucking  failure  I'm a giant  fucking failure  and nothing  worked out  that I ever  wanted  I remember  I remember 
[00:58:30]  when I turned  30 I'm like  holy fuck  I'm gonna be  40 soon  and then the  anxiety hit  and then you're  just counting  down until 40  I vividly  remember 20  now I'm 30  and that's how  close it is to  40  fuck I'm done  I'm done  it's over  it's over  and then yeah  13 a summer  took fucking  10 years  oh yeah  I was like  that goes by  like that  now  a summer  is like that  a summer  like you don't  even have enough  time to do  every weekend  but I remember  every year  when I was a kid  being shocked  when they said  there was a  fucking school 
[00:59:00]  starting  and I'd be like  what is school  what are you  talking about  eight weeks  now summer  is three electric  bills for my  pool heater  that's summer  to me  three huge  electric bills  for my pool heater  because you got  at least four  assholes every  summer that throw  some dumb party  that you have  to go to  so that's four  weekends you're  done with  right  yeah  no I'll fuck  those parties  all right  you're right  I'm talking  about that  I know what  you mean  and then all  of a sudden  like okay  now I got  four weeks  of summer  that I can  do what I  want  that's why 
[00:59:30]  like when  you get  to fucking  being an adult  you're like  why would I  buy a boat  what am I  gonna do  take it out  16 times  tops  why would I  have a fucking  boat  when you're younger  man I'm gonna  have a fucking  boat  I'm gonna have  a boat  I'm gonna be  out there  yeah and you  fantasize  pretty cool  huh  you never do  that even  when you  own a boat  you tie up  with other  drunk people  and sit and  drink and bob  like a cork  and hope the  chicks take off  their tops  and then on the 
[01:00:00]  way back you  hit a sandbar  you need a  friend to  tow you off  and then it's  laid up for  three more  weeks while you  save up money  to buy a new  prop  that's owning  a boat  yeah and then  summer's over  we uh we  gotta I think  we should take  our first break  I got some grub  but we do  have Roland in  here should we  do it after  the break  yeah we should  do it after  all right Roland  we want to  talk to you  about the  Bruce Springsteen  listening party  you can't be  happy  well I heard it  from outside  the glass  being cranked  up  why do they  fuck with you  so much  it was like  a prison visit  for you  don't they  know how  much you  like Bruce 
[01:00:30]  Springsteen  everybody  was there  I thought  Gary  were they  rocking  biting the  lower lip  with their  eyes closed  rocking their  head  I heard it  was personal  too  oh shit  it was not  a vendetta  yeah but I  heard it wasn't  personal to Roland  but personal to  the way you  guys behave  sometime  and they took  it out on  Roland  took it out  on Roland  guess what we  do we'll take  it out on  those guys  there you go  because it's  never going to  change you  fuck with one  of our guys  we make it  hurt  I like it  gang shit  only we can 
[01:01:00]  fuck with  Roland man  they don't  know the  psychological  warfare like  we do  they're just  fucking  themselves over  there's a  story with  Roland that  describes this  place perfectly  and it drives  me nuts to  this day  fucking  Springsteen  comes in  right  and they  have a  bunch of  listeners that  can take  pictures  everyone in  this building  knows how  hardcore  Roland is  for Springsteen  he has never  had a picture  with Springsteen  and they would  not allow  that to  happen  but he was  here to  take pictures  too  so it's 
[01:01:30]  not like  an inconvenience  it's just  one more  guy taking  a picture  all it  was  he wasn't  allowed to  he was  basically  told you're  not allowed  to have a  picture with  Bruce Springsteen  are you sure  there's no one  else here  for a picture  because I'm  leaving now  I'm going back  to Jersey  who wants a  picture  and the  fucking guys  in charge  here  all it would  have taken  Bruce would  have never  noticed  none of his  people would  have ever  noticed  and you  would have  taken care 
[01:02:00]  of an  employee  but here's  the thing  that Roland  was in  what he was  calling Black  Face Clarence  that day  he had like  a little bit  ten  but that  describes the  place  everything has  to be  complicated  you met  the big  man  right  once at  SNL  and that's  it  what about  everybody else  in the band  everybody else  once  it was all  SNL  they hooked  it up  and you  still don't  have a picture  of Springsteen  and that's  all you want  in your life  that's all  he wants  how many  times have  you seen 
[01:02:30]  Springsteen  250 times  and Bruce  was 10 feet  away from  and these  guys said  no you're  not allowed  to have  a picture  that's like  a year  almost  of just  seeing  Bruce  I know  it's crazy  and then  this tour  will add  it up  probably  another  60 shows  I hope  you won't  do 60  60 shows  because it's  a two and a half  to three year  tour  he's getting  paid to do  this  you're still  exaggerating  have you  fucked  250 times  yeah right  when have  done more  well he does  Jersey  sometimes he'll  do it  if he does  a 15 night stand  I would guess 
[01:03:00]  you would do  10 a year  on the new  tour  that's a big  number  if he does  the jersey  a 15 night stand  do you fantasize  that he's going  to be doing  dancing in the dark  and then put  his hand down  hey baby  and you're  standing there  and he grabs  you by the hand  pulls you up  on the stage  and you do  the Bruce dance  yeah if I lose  200 pounds  I can pump right  out  Bruce works out  he can pull you  up on that stage  he is strong  he's been working  on his biceps  see that's a bicep  joke  we had the tricep  joke  now we get  the bicep 
[01:03:30]  we'll get all  the muscle  groups  250 times  have you ever  heard him  do Thunder  Road  every show  he missed it  have you heard  every song  that he's ever  done  no  how could  you not  because he has  rare songs  what did you  miss  that you wanted  to hear  did you ever  see him do  the fever  yeah  once  what didn't  you hear  he has to  do it there  he still hasn't  heard Born or  Ron for some  weird reason  it's the oddest  thing  he won't  do it anymore  what happened  well when he did  the album shows  that's when I  caught up to hear  everything I wanted  to hear  honestly  there's no song 
[01:04:00]  that you want  to hear that  you haven't  heard  Trap  do you hear him  do Trap  twice  Trap  that was a b-side  born in the  USA  did you hear  that one  I did  a couple of  times  a few  there's some  gems though  you have to  go to different  places to hear  gems  what are some  of the gems  it's like  the covers  or some other  ones  you have to  go to Philly  or if you want  to hear Cadillac  Ranch around  Texas  what an asshole  you gotta go to  other cities  you have to go to  Texas to hear  Cadillac Ranch 
[01:04:30]  well he did it  in New Jersey  because he did  the albums  he does everything  in Jersey  I like some of  these bands  coming out  with that album  shit  it's pretty cool  yeah Bruce  started it  who started it  Bruce did not  start it  Steely Dan's  doing it  I saw Steely Dan  do it  you did  how was it  it was fucking  phenomenal  I walked by  the Beacon  Theater going  I think I want  to see this  you wanted to  see that  every night  was a different  album  and I think  they had  like  I don't know  audience pick  night  it was pretty  creative man  so now  if you're a  Steely Dan fan  you're going to  buy more than  one ticket  to the Beacon  show  I didn't think 
[01:05:00]  they fucking  played live  no they do  again  they started  again  I forgot  what albums  they did  Asia  they did  the fucking  Royal Scam  that was the  night that I  was there  and then I  kept  what I was  doing  that I felt  like was  brilliant  is like  I would  always yell  out the  next song  like I was  like you knew  like I knew  but I think  then the  encore  they do  do some  other shit  from other  albums  so it's  perfect  how was  Earl involved  with that  Earl locked 
[01:05:30]  the tickets  in for me  Earl is the  one who  made the  call  Earl Douglas  still  such a  presence  with your  show  and he's  still a  presence  in the  city  like  Earl  will  like  oh god  you should  have been  out last  night  it was  me  and you'll  just hear  this  phenomenal  night  great  night  who comes  in but  Leonard  Cohen  I thought  once he  was done  at  NEW  that was  the last  we were 
[01:06:00]  going to  hear from  Earl  Douglas  and he  just  like  the  cockroach  he just  keeps  going  see  here's  the thing  outside of  radio  that's  great  to walk  into  a bar  or whatever  with your  really black  friend  makes everyone  look at you  differently  you are the  tolerant  forward thinking  guy  so  he got me  into this  Lou Reed  photography thing  and they were  like oh let me  open it up  because you're  here with  this really  black guy  there must 
[01:06:30]  be something  happening  with you  that we  don't  understand  he's cool  you're a  black guy  obviously  you're a  hipster  you speak  a lingo  we don't  understand  you  and I'm  just like  and you know  because like  here's the  weird thing  if you don't  know Earl  he looks  militant  you know  what I mean  yeah yeah  he looks  badass  everything  about him  is in  black  so you're  like this  is like  a fucking  Malcolm X  guy  and you  gotta lean  over to him  and go  just don't  talk  don't  open your  mouth  to anybody  he's always  really shy  wherever he 
[01:07:00]  goes for a  long time  and then  people go  I thought  he was shy  and now  he calls  my house  40 times  and that's  when you  gotta move  on into  the next  party  we gotta  break  did you ask  if they  would let  you in  that  listening  party  well they  grabbed  every  programmer  and I  saw the  Bruce  management  and I  knew  something  was  going  on  so I  stayed  outside  my  office  and  everybody  was  walking  what  is the  problem  they just  put a  chair  in there  go Roland  just  come in 
[01:07:30]  check it  out  but  we got  some  business  we do  have to  take care  of here  it's not  rocket science  well they  got a bunch  of programmers  who don't  like Bruce  they're like  who hates  him  I mean  they're just  not fans  why is  everything so  complicated  does it still  drive you nuts  you couldn't get  that picture  with Bruce  because it  drives me  nuts  still  my soul  cries  every night  but that's  all  he was that  close  and all  they had to  do was  just get  online  make believe  you're  listening  I can  get you  in  get your  picture  taken  with a  Bruce 
[01:08:00]  cutout  and then  a Michael  Jordan  like how  Ronnie wears  his badge  on his  shirt  I'll lose it  I'll just  keep it  I don't  know where  it is  where you  keep it  on your  fucking  waist  there  where do  you keep  yours  in the  wallet  I keep  mine  on my  bag  and I  got a  great flip  move  when I walk  in for the  turnstile  I just  go like  that  and it  works  every time  and it's 
[01:08:30]  one swift  move  I go like  that  and then  hand it  off to  Kenny  because I  don't  carry my  own  backpack  upstairs  Kenny  carries it  going back  to what you  were saying  when we were  growing up  this was all  keys  and lots  of keys  I like  the warden  yeah  if you were  a working  man  you had  a lot  of keys  my dad  actually  worked  collecting  the money  from the  vending  machines  and he  had that  big  keychain  full of  those round  keys  that the  vending  machines  use  and just  you'd hear  him come  home  clang  clang  clang  and then 
[01:09:00]  mom would  stiffen up  because she  knew what  beating  was coming  you ever  borrow  one of  those keys  and see  what it  could open  up  what are  you kidding  how didn't  he know  open up  my fucking  lip  is what  it would  open up  how did  he know  what went  to what  though  how did  he figure  it out  I don't  know  he probably  didn't  because I  have two keys  and can't get  into the house  I don't know  how did  but then he got  fired from that  job because he  was dipping  into the quarters  of the candy bars  of course he did  we didn't have  dinner but he'd  come home with  like Hershey bars  and go here you go  it was like  fucking 48 hours  here's your  god damn dinner 
[01:09:30]  convict  fucking zag nut  this is great  he was dipping  into the quarters  oh yeah  yeah  I've sold from  every job I ever  worked at  I don't know  why anybody  wouldn't  who doesn't  pilfer from the  jobs you're at  especially when  it's pilferable  stuff  I told a story  many times  where I stole  silver  I was working  at Deutsch  Relays  it was this  place that  made contacts  for relays  and they were  made out of  silver and gold  and they had  these long  fucking bars  of silver  in little tubes  and they kept  them in a cage  but they kept  the silver  right near the 
[01:10:00]  edge of the cage  so I'd go  with needle nose  pliers  get in there  and grab it  and silver  is pretty soft  so I'd wrap  them around  my legs  and my arms  and I'd walk  out like a  robot to my  car and drive  to this  fucking jewelry  store  and they would  file it  test it  and give me  some cash  and I'd go  back  and I knew  damn well  what was going on  no security  cameras back then  they didn't know  believe me  if they knew  they would have  fucking prosecuted  to the full extent  the jewelry guys  knew  oh they didn't  give a shit  now I worked  at the Franklin 
[01:10:30]  Mint  and we were  like things of gold  and we treated  it like we were  in prison  like we would  be working in  there and you'd  always be like  I think this wall  get us out  like even your  boss would be  like you know  what I was  thinking  we get enough  of us  we get a truck  driver involved  really  get on one  of these walls  just tap this  a little  keeping a poster  up  of Raquel Welch  oh wow  very good  bravo

[01:16:00]  year there  I could look  Ronnie in the  eye  yeah  I suggested  Earl  traded Earl  I thought Earl  was ready for  the big time  now he's into  hard rock with  Johnny so it's  he's the head  of I don't  know something  he's the vibe  manager  I'm going to  learn the casino  game  we got to  figure out  final countdown  he's banging  waitresses  two at a time  can't even get  a drink  we got to  figure out  final countdown  Europe  right  is it  Europe  so something's  wrong with  Europe  something with  the Euro  maybe  final countdown  I'm going to 
[01:16:30]  go with  Gary Carter  Mets legend  really  he has weeks  to live  they found  more tumors  what  no  no way  no  that's  fucking  terrible  they're pretty  much going to  stop treatment  do you think  it was  maybe some  steroids  do you think  he was doing  it  I don't know  I honestly  believe he's  going to  beat it  right now  he's going to  be playing  again  final countdown  for Gary  Carter  no  is that a  good guess  no  fuck 
[01:17:00]  something with  the space  program  no  see that's  what I would  have done  well Buzz Aldrin  is 82 today  is that it  that could have  been a final  countdown  you know  he launched  his space  that would  be clever  yeah  that would  be  clever  that would  be clever  Wikipedia  the word  clever  check it  out  and the  fucking  the Gary  Carter thing  was kind  of clever  is it  down syndrome  countdown  syndrome  countdown  syndrome  it could  be something  with the  special  Olympics  no  Sarah Palin's  kid  something's 
[01:17:30]  wrong with  trick  something  there's  something  going on  oh and I  saw this in  the paper  that West  Memphis  three  yeah  yeah  they killed  those little  kids  I heard  they fucking  murdered  yeah  and they're  out  and they raped  them and they ate  their clothes  yes  and they're out  because of the devil  music of metal  metal devil music  they were listening to like  Ozzy  is that it  is that it  Metallica  what do you got  is that it  no  are we ready  for the real  answer  count  it doesn't matter  it's going to be 
[01:18:00]  wrong anyway  well no  we gave you  two good ones  Eric Carter's  counting down  the days of his  life  and you got  Buzz Aldrin  with the final  countdown  and he goes  into space  have some faith  in your work  Iraq  come on  what do you got  work  well 70 years ago  the Nazis arrived  at a final solution  for exterminating  the Jews of Europe  7 years ago  70 years  oh I thought it was  a little longer  than that  70 years ago  the final solution  2005  yeah  2005  I remember that  it was terrible  wow  the Nazis  never forget  7 years ago  final countdown 
[01:18:30]  the final countdown  when you had  Buzz Aldrin's birthday  he had final  I'm going to give him  a 1  for effort  like you  you really tried  there to make it  different  to not just play  the band  and have it have  something to do  with the band  right  like you would  using the music  to do something  completely different  than the music  Paul Stanley's 60  today  so he would have  played  something from  Destroyer  and it would have  been oh  Paul Stanley's 60  and you know  you play Kiss  it's about Kiss  so you went  completely off book  here  but a little  offensive 
[01:19:00]  he went final  he went final  solution  final countdown  final solution  final countdown  it doesn't make  any sense  whatsoever  by the way  nonsense  well he's thinking  though  it's dangerous  when he thinks  he's starting to think  a little  he's all  dangerous  final final  that's great  how do you feel  about that one  you're all full of shit  why didn't you play  Suicide Solution  wow why are we full of shit  no he's angry  final countdown  to what  Jews being extinct  they're not extinct  they're not extinct  like a fucking T-Rex  what's wrong with you  people  like the woolly mammoth  I just talked to my lawyer yesterday 
[01:19:30]  that's crazy  they're not extinct  they're not a myth  they exist  I swear  but it's just weird  how it works out  final countdown  Buzz Aldrin's birthday  would have been great  that would have been great  I like that  yeah yeah  I like that  I actually would have  given him credit  like that's what we're looking for  that's it  countdown  he's all about the countdown  the guy lived for countdown  he gave a shit  when he was here  now you're gonna care  about his birthday  he punched people in the nose  when they said  he didn't land on the moon  so he does care  he didn't  they shot that in the studio 
[01:20:00]  is that all on green screen  are you a green screen guy  I know it for a fact  Ronnie's a green screen guy  he's actually in front of mine  his uncle worked  I worked at NASA at the time  I didn't know Ronnie  was his green screen guy  you ever see  you ever see Capricorn 1  with OJ  that's exactly what it was  they didn't go to Mars  no they didn't go anywhere  and then they killed OJ  and the guy from the  TD Waterhouse commercials  no  that was the guy by the way  and seriously  how did that other building fall  the whole thing  you know what  the timing doesn't work  because the floors can't fall  if gravity  if you 
[01:20:30]  whatever  but that's exactly why  you can't say it  I don't want to say it  because we're on the air  but shadow government  that's the only fucking thing  I'm saying right now  shadow government  is this all on iBang  oh the interrobang  now you would tell me  but is it not  wait  the iBang  it's the iBang  no I do the Twitter thing  so it's the iBang  you can go through the iBang  we can go through the interrobang  interrobang yeah  but there is some stuff  that you guys need to see  up there today  because this is some  young kids in Harlem  who saw  a UFO

[01:31:30]  could fucking come up  gets in there  mole  is there a mole  yeah  is there a year of the mole  no I don't  are you comfortable  around Asian people  like when you're  in Chinatown  no I don't  it's like I'm  on another planet  I feel like  it's very strange  that's the closest  you get to aliens  Asians  yeah  I really do  that and cats  for real  now  cats make me feel like  I'm getting close to aliens  that's a crazy alien right  cats are fucked up  no  they're from another world  and Asians  same thing  now what is it  you fear a cat 
[01:32:00]  a little bit  you feel like  they're up to something  they will rip your balls off  yeah  they will  a dog is loyal as hell  the cats  cats suck  they really do  you don't think  a dog will fucking rip your throat out  when you're fucking pet  they're loyal  they'll rip out everyone else's throat  but not the owners  what about the ones that turn on the kids  you can own a cat for 10 years  and think you're getting somewhere with them  and you do one thing wrong  they're clawing your eyes out  they're fucked up  cats are fucked up  you have cats Ronnie  no  dogs  no I don't like animals  they don't take care of themselves 
[01:32:30]  they don't feed themselves  look look at this  I love this cat  where's his ears  dude  it's so mad  tell me you're not looking at an alien right there  that's alien shit  what is that so pissed off at  what the fuck is that man  what the fuck is that  why are people disliking the video  it's a great video  it's just that the cat's an asshole  well who dislikes it 
[01:33:00]  look you look and see the dislikes  how do you dislike an angry cat video  oh there's another one  that thing's pissed  alright  pause it  pause it  holy shit  that's going after the owner  that's what I'm trying to tell you  they probably have this cat forever  I feed you  and they still haven't gotten anywhere with the damn thing  if it wasn't for me you'd die  and the fucking thing is scratching at them  right  what could the owner have possibly done  to the damn thing  after all these years  the other thing about a cat  is there's no real texture to its shit  unlike every other mammal 
[01:33:30]  you know what I mean  they never take a solid shit  they really do point out those details  that other people don't really see  I never noticed that  you're right though  it's got to be said  a dog shit  it's fucking dog shit  you don't want to be in the same room as a cat shit  with dog shit  you'll throw it at your friends  yes  what were you getting at with the Asian thing  because I think you might have been onto something  well I don't  you know  I'm just saying in terms of  like you could go to Harlem  walk around  feel comfortable  talk to people  yes 
[01:34:00]  but when you're in Chinatown  maybe you  all kidding aside  during the day  I would go up to Harlem  no problem  you can't always cop during the day  but when you  but when you go to Chinatown  you never completely feel like you fit in  you don't feel welcome  it's a weird thing  a whole different culture  that we don't quite understand  they don't seem to smile a lot  I was talking about Asians last night  after Red Eye  there's like  these  they don't  you'll never see an Asian guy  that's like  hey everyone  how you doing  it's like this  mechanized  kind of just 
[01:34:30]  you know  right on a track  they're just going  there's a purpose  it's like  ants  dismantling a cricket  and bringing them back into the hole  that's pretty much what you get  and I try  I try  I go to the restaurants  in my neighborhood  and these people look at me  like  it's the Patrice bit  unfortunately  but it's true  you're going to these restaurants  and it's like  hello  I've been here a million fucking times  how about we say hi to each other  at this point  hot right  but any other restaurant  you know  you're going in there  you're spending your money  they're like  hey  good to see you again  you want your table 
[01:35:00]  that I know you like  and they look  the Asian restaurants  they stare at you  like who are you  you know  I went into a Vietnamese restaurant  with  with a knife in your mouth  and a gun in your hand  that was a tunnel rat  that was years ago  oh shit  that was years ago  sorry  with a gun like this  yeah yeah  with a flashlight  yeah  Thai restaurants  and Vietnamese restaurants  not as bad  well here's the thing  is what I would say  the Vietnamese restaurant  had two different menus  and I didn't know it  until I was with this Vietnamese girl  who told me  that it's the us menu 
[01:35:30]  and the them menu  so I come in  I'm like  why is this so cheap  well because I'm speaking Vietnamese  I'm like  how do you fucking get away with that  you know what I mean  no one else  could you imagine  if you had a white menu  and a black menu  that'll be $45 for that  paradise  yeah  you walk around Chinatown  sorry  told this story many times  but there's  there's restaurants down in Chinatown  I learned this after the fact  that are for the tourists  like us dummies  walking around like idiots  and then there's restaurants 
[01:36:00]  for just the locals  and if you walk into  one of these restaurants  for just the locals  they will not serve you properly  they'll make you wait  it happened to us  I always feel like  I'm in a video game  when I'm in Chinatown  it's like the neon lights  and Chinese people  it's like a first person shooter  they can't tell you  not to come in  but if you do happen  to end up in one of these places  the service will be so bad  that you will now say to yourself  well I'm never going back  not coming back  but they don't want you  triads  triads  the triads from Grand Theft Auto 
[01:36:30]  always hard to kill in GTA  oh man  what a pain in the ass  in the trucks  fuck yeah  it's like I can't outrun  a fucking box truck  in a Ferrari  what a pain in the ass  those guys were  fucking rock star  anyway  let's talk about Newt Gingrich  oh right  the big debate last night  for the South Carolina primary  I love Newt Gingrich  I just don't want him  to be my president  why  why  what would be so bad  I don't want any of them  it is bad  I don't want any of them  across the board  I'm not doing  oh that's great 
[01:37:00]  that's good right there  yeah  I love Newt's attitude though  but the thing is  even the Republicans  are saying that  Newt they're calling him  like Obama too  they're saying it's the same thing  the Republicans don't  even like Mitt Romney  they don't like  they don't like anyone  the Democrats don't like Obama  what the fuck happened  to this country  no one likes anyone  no one feels like they've won  no  no  no one will feel like they won  even after the election  it'll feel like  like I  I'm in the position  where I just have to vote 
[01:37:30]  for anyone but Obama  like that's how I feel  actually  because I feel Obama  has a personal vendetta  against me  and my money  he wants to tax me  even more  I watch MSNBC  I see what those guys say  uh you're not paying  your fair share of taxes  you're not  and they's the one  be eating the pie  what  you know  can I say that on MSNBC  oh yeah  I haven't seen the  Reverend Al  Reverend Al  the GOP  the ones be eating the pie  you know what 
[01:38:00]  I'm gonna  I'm gonna change my  my thought here  I want Newt King  which is the president  I would love him  because he would make it  so much fun  it would be fun  he would make it  so much fun  yeah  so is that an official endorsement  yes he would be  bitch slapping everyone  now did you feel  that his ex  came out  and started to tell the  he made me go down  on another chair  that could fucking happen  to anybody  oh yeah  we know  some of the shit  he would do  it was just sick  look my shit 
[01:38:30]  was in the daily news  and the post  when I had to get up  on a stand  and talk about  how I fucking  was in  I shared my marital bed  with another woman  but that's what Newt wanted  why did we go  Old Testament  I know  what the fuck  he shared his marital bed  but that's what Newt wanted  the heathen  yeah the ex  comes out and says  Newt wanted an open marriage  I love how  how everybody  when Newt like lambasted  we're gonna play that clip  we have to  but the applause  that were coming  from the conservative right  Christian right 
[01:39:00]  like  Christians for adultery  Christians for adultery  but it's about time  someone fucking bitch slaps  I loved it  these guys  John King looked like a  like a dummy in a hot tub  Romney has gotta be thinking  how is this working against me  this was supposed to be  the knockout punch  this was the one  and he's making it work for him  it's been a set up  for Romney since the beginning  that to some reason  I know I'm being a little paranoid  but they wanted to  to leave him as second  to fucking tear down 
[01:39:30]  one guy after another  and the Mormon runs through  and then they got something  on him later  later on  later on his  fucking thing will come down  so this was supposed to be  the knockout punch for Newt  that you know  particularly because of  the party that he's in  like everyone's like  Clinton did it  but Clinton's a democrat  you know what I mean  so  Republicans don't do this  they have a moral  like he was preaching morality  and family values  and all that happy horse shit  and at the same time  he's apparently trying to get 
[01:40:00]  some other chick in bed with him  every fucking news station  has John King  looking like a bitch  you want to play the clip  yeah let's hear this  I fucking loved  that Newt did this  right off the bat too  first thing out of the gate  at the debate  John King couldn't wait  yeah everything else  was nothing  this is the only clip  they're playing today  the debate started  and John King  started with this  yo wife  everyone has heard this  by now I'm sure  as you know  your ex-wife  gave an interview  to ABC News  and another interview  with the Washington Post  and this story  has now gone viral 
[01:40:30]  on the internet  in it she says  that you came to her  in 1999  at a time  when you were having an affair  she says you asked her  sir to enter  by the way  for anyone else  you're sitting there  going humming  humming  humming  and dude  handled this perfectly  well he  you know what I mean  he was coming  but the thing is  you know  from radio  you don't open  with your fucking  big thing  you make it fucking  hang there for a while  right  this guy came in  and couldn't wait  to throw it out  that was stupid  right  she says you asked her  sir to enter into 
[01:41:00]  an open marriage  would you like to take  some time to respond  to that  no  but I will  I think  I think the destructive  vicious  negative nature  of much of the news media  makes it harder  harder to govern  this country  harder to attract  decent people  to run for public  office  and I am appalled 
[01:41:30]  that you would begin  a presidential debate  on a topic like that  applaud  yeah  Yankees  Yankees  oh  that was a ball game  it's a debate  that Putin and Hollywood  every person in here  knows personal pain  every person in here  has had someone  close to them 
[01:42:00]  you know  that is  that is directly  gone  you've all  tried to fuck  two women  you've all  done it  everyone in here  has known  you know  personal pain  and by that  I mean  one fucking  fucking  one on your face  you know what I'm  talking about  you know what I'm  talking about  fucking handle it  perfectly  I don't think  there's a lot of  guys that can  handle this  the second he heard  that he was probably  going  I can't believe  he's doing it  the first question  this is perfect  like he knew  that was coming up  and he knew  he was going to  say this 
[01:42:30]  right  someone close to  them  go through  painful things  painful  to take an  ex-wife  and make it  two days before  the primary  a significant  question in a  presidential campaign  is as close to  despicable  as anything I can  imagine  you make me sick  get off the stand  I want to talk  about defusing  something  you're despicable  that's going to be  I mean he did  definitely did it up  front but they're  going to still come  back because there's  going to be more  details and for us 
[01:43:00]  it doesn't matter  there are women out  there who go to  church who he's  fucked with there's  no way you can get  around it  and also they're  going to say by the  way when he did  this he was going  after Clinton for  licking a fat girl's  asshole or whatever  he was doing  fucking her with a  cigar  the timing was bad  he's going after  Clinton as he's  pretty much doing  the same thing  I was trying to  make the argument  last night and it  wasn't coming off  very well but that  you don't have to be  this moral fucking 
[01:43:30]  saint in order to  preach morality  like I it sounds  hypocritical but it's  almost my father  saying you know do  as I say not as I  do right well kind  of a thing it's it's  it helps but you  could know what's  right and still not  do it you sound  exactly like you  were raised Catholic  yes because they  would lay the rules  on us and they were  getting blow jobs  and they were doing  stuff so we were  like yeah I guess I  don't know whatever 
[01:44:00]  but the fact is that  is a way of keeping  stupid people down  it's what they've done  forever yeah because  when you are in a  leadership opinion  place you feel  fucking superior  right to the people  that you're leading  so you could do what  you want but you  know better it's like  a marriage counselor  that's never been  married but that to  me seems very odd  but they they'll know  everything but they've  never been married so  you don't have the  experience how the  fucking you when we  went through baby  classes there was a  lady up there that 
[01:44:30]  fucking never had  kids she's telling  us how it's gonna  yeah and she's telling  us how we're gonna  handle this shit  yeah and all she  had was a dog and  actually told the  told everyone in the  room I don't even  know why you'd want  to be a parent see  and she was the one  teaching you how to  bring a newborn  right see that's it  that's the same shit  you're saying and  and just because  newt was like you  know preaching family  values and saying  clinton shouldn't be  doing what he's doing  yeah you know right  he's maybe he was you  know thought he was 
[01:45:00]  right and other people  thought he's right and  said yeah clinton  shouldn't be doing  that but it's like  yeah I'm doing this  but the same people  that went after the  same people that  backed out on clinton  are gonna back out on  this guy and it ain't  us and it isn't most  I don't think we've  even met the kind of  people that this  matters to but they  vote too oh yeah  that's the fucked up  thing about it but do  you think a president  it's gonna hurt newt  do you think a president  needs to be this moral  fucking wonder  no of course not  give a fuck  I don't give a fuck  what he does  no of course not  but that's why I like  Ron Paul who said  none of this shit 
[01:45:30]  fucking matters  just fucking take care of  the stuff we need to  if you get behind  Ron Paul he's getting  rid of the military  he's getting rid of  the cops there won't  be any bridges  seriously it's gonna  roll it's gonna be  the best fucking  fight club thing  it'll be exciting as  all hell I really  want Ron Paul  yeah Armageddon  and I hope that I  hope that he goes  with third party  because I want to  vote third party I  don't want to vote  for anyone I've ever  seen I would actually  just someone I never  saw if they just  came in a couple days 
[01:46:00]  before would be  fucking great yeah  yeah I like the  whole Ron Paul  no government  nothing I want to  be elected so you  don't have to do  anything I say and  I am powerless  if I am elected  you will be warring  over gasoline  within six months  like the road  warrior  there'll be gangs  of gasoline  people  three days ago  I saw a rig that  will hold that  tanker  that's what I  want  go back to 12  monkeys we talked  about 12 monkeys  earlier  that's what I want  I love  that's a world  anarchy  it'd be great  that's a world  with Ron Paul  as president 
[01:46:30]  so by the way  so far I've brought  up 14 fucking  movies and I try  to throw it out  there and Ant  is fucking nailed  and impressing it  in a line from  every one of them  I've wasted youth  in front of television  it's horrid  do we got more  yeah Newt continued  as you noted Mr. Speaker  this story did not  come from our network  as you also know  it is a subject  of conversation  I get your point  I take your point  John it was repeated  by your network  you chose to start  the debate with it  don't try to blame  somebody else  you and your staff  chose to start  this debate  let me be quite clear 
[01:47:00]  let me be quite clear  the story is false  every personal friend  I have who knew us  in that period  says the story was false  we offered several  of them to ABC  to prove it was false  they weren't interested  because they would like  to attack any Republican  they're attacking  the governor  they're attacking me  I'm sure they'll  present it around  to Senator Santorum  and Congressman Paul  I am tired  of the elite media  protecting Barack Obama  by attacking the  yeah motherfuckers 
[01:47:30]  that's what I'm  talking about  Newt  take that John  that's my man  right there  Newt Gingrich  so you  you honestly think  he can beat Romney  though  yeah I think  with stuff like this  yeah  this is  because he's at the  if he doesn't win  in two days  yeah  it's over  it's over  he needs this  and it's not  this is what kills me  so you won't even  get a vote  I don't even get a chance  to say  it'll be  you're depending  on some people  in South Carolina  to make a move 
[01:48:00]  and like 30 people  that's fucked up  I mean you never  got your chance  at Perry  you never got your chance  at fucking Bachman  so you're waiting  it's a crazy system  for some other  fucking peoples  with other ideas  that you've never met  you don't even know  what they're about  and not even a lot of them  you've been to South Carolina  to get gas  on the way to Florida  but you don't know much  you know you're like  south of the border  how far is that place  great man  there's a lot of funny signs  by fireworks  but you are now  depending on these people 
[01:48:30]  and hoping  that they keep  your candidate alive  long enough  for you to get them  that makes no fucking sense  so you have a shot at it  yeah  makes no sense  yeah the system  I don't like it  it is crazy  that you don't get  the chance  to fucking matter  yeah  Iowa matters  how did that happen  Iowa, New Hampshire  and then by South Carolina  it's done  usually right  they move on to Florida  next I think  Florida  and then we're going  to take Minnesota  it's super Tuesday 
[01:49:00]  falls in there somewhere  I don't know  the whole thing's a joke  it is very fucking difficult  to get behind  the system feels  more and more  broken  every election  yeah  every four years  it's more busted  wow  and with Ron Paul  we get rid of the bridges  we get rid of the air  where you get rid of  the water supply  want to be fun  driving over  the Tappan Z  not knowing when  it's just going to  fall down  because no maintenance  has happened 
[01:49:30]  no tolls  no nothing  fucking gangs  from the Warriors  are fucking hanging out  swinging bats around  swinging mace  and fucking shooting you  with flaming arrows  Ronnie's going to have to  deal with the Ron Paul  guys now today  I'm a big fan  I'm a big fan  I would give Ron Paul  I really want him to go  third party  I'm not going to vote  Democrat  I'm not going to vote  Republican  I'm done with everybody  Ron's going third  just walk away  leave the fuel  just walk away  I would love that  a warlord  that's why Ron Paul  that's why he's still in there 
[01:50:00]  he's just going to switch over  to the third party thing  yeah  I don't know  he's had chances  and he hasn't done it yet  he's waiting for this  whole thing to finally end  but if Newt pulls this off  in two days  no one is going to be  more shocked than Romney  because he thought  he's the guy  was the knockout punch  but you know  the fact is  just think to yourself  no matter who you are  at what age  did you become  unelectable  because I know  for a fact  14  for me  I'd done all this shit 
[01:50:30]  that you could not  become president for  I'd already done it  and again  I was talking about  that last night  you can't  have groomed yourself  since you're  you pretty much  have to not have done  anything bad  from 12  let's say  they'll give you  your childhood  you know  you fucking broke  something  unless you killed  you're one of those  like  well he was eight  and he raped  and killed somebody  maybe not  but like from 12 on  you have to know  well I'm  I want to be president  so I gotta be a good boy  you're gonna fuck up 
[01:51:00]  and why does that  make you a guy  that shouldn't be president  you probably know  economics  you might be able  to be the best guy  to go overseas  and talk with these  crazy leaders  and you can't  because at 20  you fucking took a chick  for an abortion  and I would take  her to the abortion  I'll get you  one of them abortions  my brother got one  and the people  that are outraged  have way bigger  fuck ups  yeah  the more outrage  you have  you probably have  more fuck ups  in your life  right  and bigger ones  now just think 
[01:51:30]  is there a company  that maybe you  invested in  and if you found out  the CEO  had a fucking affair  you would pull  your money  out  no matter how much  money I was making  off of the company  no I gotta pull out  I gotta get  it's a moral obligation  yeah it's not right  we gotta pull  our money back  from Apple  because he  by the way  Newt did this  whether you like  him or hate him  he did fucking  tell his chick  here's the way  it's gonna be  he did not  sneak around  like a lot  of fucking people  he's gonna like  I got some  great news for you  not gonna have 
[01:52:00]  to blow me  all the time  there's a lot  of other shit  going on  it's gonna be great  for everybody  don't you want  a guy that can  negotiate like that  just take a problem  discuss it  talk it out  because there's a lot  of guys that won't  be up front  right  you know  and he wasn't  he definitely  didn't try to  you know  make a fool  about her  or whatever  let her hear it  somewhere  he gave her  the fucking  good news  up front  that's what I  did with the  ex-wife  I got an ultimatum  from her  she gave me  an ultimatum  she said it's  either me 
[01:52:30]  or her  and I gave her  an answer  get the fuck  out of my house  it was brilliant  see I was being  honest  you were  so I'm a good  man  and yet  unelectable  you are  unelectable  totally unelectable  because of that  that very thing  wanting to fuck  a different woman  while I was married  makes me a bad guy  so I'm the bad guy  I'm the bad guy  I'm the bad guy  I don't get it  now  do you think  that this will 
[01:53:00]  spin thing  maybe this could  finally be the thing  where America  grows up  grows up  and realizes  that everyone  isn't fucking  holier than thou  except for  the thing is  we still  pay attention  to who  Johnny Depp  is with  and who  gives a fuck  you really  don't you expect  adults to fuck  particularly  when their  fucking things  are going good  and they're meeting  a lot of  fucking people  we love to  like America  loves to think  no one fucks  unless you're married  and for the purpose  of having children  procreation  people fuck 
[01:53:30]  because it feels  great  I think the  applause you heard  last night  it goes to  Ronnie's point  maybe it's about  time  that was people  that like to  fuck  yeah  fucking  other women  you were surprised  by that reaction  right  I was  I think a lot  of people were  so maybe that's  enough already  with this horse shit  but see the thing  is that might have  just been a  we hate CNN  Republican thing  you know what I mean  the Obama thing  did get the bigger  like hey you guys  don't come down  on Obama  they went bullshit  on that one 
[01:54:00]  well I'll tell you  this  I guarantee you  that fucking  Obama ain't fucking  outside of marriage  because he's scared  shitless  oh man  of that woman  she fucking  runs him down  in public  runs him down  in public  she'll be like  well his feet  stink  and everybody laughs  I'm like  this fucking guy's  depressed  and he's like  well you know  sometimes I forget  to bathe  well it does stink  he'll go wrong  with everything  she says  oh dear  you see where  they gave him  the baseball bat  the other day 
[01:54:30]  and he's like  well I'll hold  on to this  because I don't  want my wife  getting it  and then she  came over  and took it  from him  and goes  give me that  give me that  and he's like  oh well she is  the bat  well she's the one  that wears the  strap on  and the pants  on the family  speaking of Obama  he's terrific  at singing Al Green  oh did he do that  oh this is terrific  at a fundraiser  in Apollo  you're an Al Green fan  I love Al Green  love Al Green  love the reverend  I used to have to  come on after Al Green  yeah  in Geneva New York  yeah  fuck yeah  there was a gospel show  right before my little radio show 
[01:55:00]  was it just from his church thing  or  no I mean it was a gospel show  so you heard a lot of Al Green  I couldn't name a second artist  in the gospel music genre  there's a church  I don't know whether it's still going on  that you go to in Memphis  that Al Green  is there  he's the guy  and you go  and you sit in a balcony  you can't sit with  the regular people  but you watch Al Green  but he'll never do any of the songs  you want to hear  he's like  I hope he does  let's stay together  no no no  the Baptists  they know how to fucking  pray man  right  I've been in a couple of those churches 
[01:55:30]  over the years  it just looks very hot  it's very hot and sweaty in there  but man it's a lot of fun  yeah oh  I'm getting a touch of the vapors  there's no air conditioned churches  no no  what the fuck  down south you have a building  you're raising money  the second after you get a roof  get an AC  let's start with the AC  pump some fucking air in there  get that before you get a bus  or whatever these other things are you thinking  who doesn't like a gospel brunch  you're just sweating your balls off  here's Obama  and then to know that 
[01:56:00]  Reverend Al Green was here  I'm so in love with you  that's Obama?  wow  he nailed it  man  oh here comes the Sandman  to pull him off  Jesus Christ  give the guy a chance  those guys didn't think I would do it 
[01:56:30]  that's it though  come on  I told you I was gonna do it  that's all he gave us  why does he sound blacker?  because the Sandman did not come out  he just did the Sandman  yeah  did he?  he did the Sandman line  ah shit  did he rub the stump  oh was that the Apollo?  it wasn't the Apollo  yeah  oh damn  he got a bigger ovation  than an Asian guy that raps  oh  they go over great at the Apollo  they're like  ah  ah  oh shit  oh the Asian guy rapping  it's great  they love him 
[01:57:00]  so Al Green was sitting there  when he did the Al Green impression  that was  what?  he wasn't next to him  but he was on the bill  he was there  yeah  did they show Al Green  and was he like  ah shit  no  Obama hit that one note  we've got Sly Stone here  boom shagalaka  boom shagalaka  boom shagalaka  yeah  Obama ate like  fucking  600 yards from my house  last night  what?  oh he was in town  yeah  he was on the East  I ate a Daniel 
[01:57:30]  and I  trying to get through  my neighborhood  where it's just  loaded up with cops  oh yeah  every  and then there was  any of the stores around  there were cops  in the stores  amazing  watching people in case  they acted like  they were going to the store  and then tried to dive  out the back window  isn't that fucked up  like  what happened to the  good old days  wow  where a president could just  yes I'm taking the train out  and he's on back of the train  just meeting the people  I think 1963  took care of that  did it  yeah  was that what it was  before that 
[01:58:00]  ah yeah  maybe  he was killed by  a shadow government  oh everyone knows that  come on  Harvey who  stop it  we gotta take a break  because our guests are arriving  oh we got Mick Foley  Mick Foley's next  he's coming in  is he gonna be Mankind  or Dude Love  when he comes in  I told him for Ron  it had to be Dude Love  Dude Love  because I'm a big fan of Dude Love  Dude Love  nothing beat the Dude Love intro  where he was dancing around  in the tie-dye shirt  with a bad green screen  behind him  what was the song  that he danced to though Sam  it was his own 
[01:58:30]  but it was like a Bee Gees ripoff  but he was dressed as a hippie  it was a disco song  yet he was supposed to be  a Dude Love hippie  but I didn't get  this is fantastic  why is it disco  Dude Love bitches  they just picked a background  and went with it  and green screened him  it's old school production 
[01:59:00]  he's doing like a mime thing  why is that supposed to be Dude Love  with that music  it doesn't make sense  and then he's just doing  a thumbs up  and doing the Charleston  but it works  in front of a cactus  because he's dressed like  he's going to Woodstock  but it's disco music  is it supposed to be  like an acid trip  is the background  supposed to be an acid trip  we'll ask him  that makes sense  he's here  we might as well ask him  Mick Foley's next  I don't know  we really gotta go to break  because then Mark Cuban  is standing by as well  the owner of the Dallas Mavericks 
[01:59:30]  he's got a couple of bucks  that guy  oh man  we should ask him  for some money today man  he probably could buy you a TV  I owe Mick Foley money  you do  oh shit  he's been tweeting me  about it too  do you have it  it's going to hit the fan  $520  you got it today  yeah  oh my god  it's going to break your heart  that is a lot of fucking money  that's a lot of money  for Sam  you know what  I tipped the dealer  give me the fucking money  I'm not even giving it to you  look if you fucking want  Sid  you know what  give me $300  and I'll take care of 
[02:00:00]  the whole fucking thing  right now  you're going to buy his deck  give me fucking $300  don't even ask me  what fucking happened  that means you keep $220  that means you keep $220  it's a good deal  Ronnie gets $100  don't even fucking ask the word  alright  Mick Foley next  stay there  3SXM  the Opie and Anthony show  yeah  yeah  dude love  dude love  getting topical  this uh 
[02:00:30]  of course  dude love  I can't get enough  of this video  Mick Foley  in studio  yep  um  I am  I'm fascinated  by the dude love  this is from 98  1998  it's your  your intro video  that you used to come out to  when you were dude love  oh yeah  and I don't understand it  I'm fascinated by it  and I have no understanding  well let's start with this  here's the problem  you look like you're 
[02:01:00]  going to go to  Woodstock  or a Grateful Dead show  but you got disco music  disco music  they don't match  and the background  has nothing to do with anything  I think you're overthinking this  I think you are overthinking this  but this was huge  but it was huge  but it was part of a big program sir  yeah it wasn't like a  this wasn't like  this isn't a podcast opening  this wasn't cable access  this is WWF  if you go back  if you go back  into the archives  and you look at  have a nice day  which you have  right  of course  I read it 
[02:01:30]  I ask myself  those same questions  really  yeah  so you were just along  for the ride  yep  okay  I'll get in front of a green screen  and dude love it  around  well I don't know  if you remember back  to when  Sam  you have to remember  when  dude love interviewed  mankind  who introduced  Cactus Jack  wow  in order to do that  we had to spend  12 hours  against the green screen  you know  12 hours  how long was the intro  it's Mick Foley 
[02:02:00]  and Mick Foley  and Mick Foley  the dude was supposed to  wrestle Triple H  in Madison Square Garden  in a  Falls Count Anywhere match  but he admitted  you know  he was the one guy  who admitted to being  like cowardly  he's like  oh daddy  Falls Count Anywhere  isn't exactly my bag  a cat whose bag  it indeed is  he's my man  he's my main man  you might even say  he's a kind man  he brought out  mankind  and then  you know  to this day  I'm like 
[02:02:30]  wow  did we really  spend three hours  getting the high five  you know  oh right  you had to get it  perfect  oh you're too slow  and it was after  12 hours  of doing the green screen  they were like  hey do you want to  do something  for the video  and that time  you know  I was so tired  I had to get over  to the studio  about 4 o'clock  they just started  picking stuff  out of the studio  and said  let's do this  so when I'm flying  it's the background  I have that black hat  with the big bandana  the black hat  was actually  an undertaker prop  so I had to put 
[02:03:00]  the bandana around  to put my big stamp  on it  and I just thought  let me just do  as many stupid things  as I can think of  and if I can  I just always felt  like if I can  entertain myself  there will be  a small percentage  of people  that will actually  also be entertained  well let's watch it  oh yeah yeah  it's on YouTube  we gotta be queued up  this is good stuff  frightening is China  yeah China's in there  before any kind  of cosmetic surgery  before they try  to make her  sort of look like a girl  pre-porn  pre-porn China  pre-porn China 
[02:03:30]  pre-porn  yeah pre-porn  with the big jaw  that they had to fix  I always thought  she was like  maybe Sergeant Slaughter's  daughter  with that  Slaughter daughter  Slaughter daughter  she had the same  she had the same jaw  you know what  big jaw  or not big jaw  porn or no porn  she's still a really cool  oh we're not  we're not bashing her  I love that  giant fucking clit  the clit was a little  too big  you know I  I wrestled her one time 
[02:04:00]  you did  I did wrestle her one time  yeah  you grabbed the clit  oh no  but it was oddly  erotic  no  I don't doubt it  come on  you've got your hands on her  her skin was really smooth  yeah  that's nice  it's called a girl  that's how girls are  you must like trannies  you like trannies huh  no  let's not  there was a rumor  a rumor  a rumor  a rumor  rumbling around  about a tranny  going around  having her way  with the guys 
[02:04:30]  in WCW  wow  there did seem  to be  somewhat  a voice  several octaves  below  that rumor  didn't come out  from the warrior  did it  he loves  that guy  love rumors  Hulk Hogan  your wife  and every member  of the WWE  boy that guy  really went  bullshit huh  yeah  you know  when people ask me  have you seen that  like as soon as I see  somebody going into  business for himself  I tune out 
[02:05:00]  really  I only want the real  stuff  the stuff you hear  yes  exactly  thank you  let's play this video  do love interviews  mankind  and cactus jack  what you see is about  two three minutes on screen  twelve hours  twelve hours  bad boy  yeah  that's three radio shows  that's crazy  let's give it a shot  keep in mind  they had no idea  how the appearance  of cactus jack 
[02:05:30]  would actually go over  in front of a crowd  right  and it's serious  serious doubts  here he is  oh  have mercy  Hunter  and especially  your finer  China  I know what you  must be thinking  dude  what are you doing  back here  when you should be  out there  kicking some  heavy duty booty  all over the  garden  Hunter my man  I believe it's time  we had a little rap  because you see  balls count anywhere  well 
[02:06:00]  that's not exactly  my bag baby  the pin falls  in the hot dog stand  the pin falls  in the streets  the chairs  the tables  it's not exactly  a love thing  but I know  somebody  daddy  who's bag  it indeed is  he's my man  he's my main man  you might even say  well daddy  he's a kind man  oh  a kooky type of cat  let's bring him out  right now 
[02:06:30]  oh  mankind  my  what  I'm high  big man  whoa  that's crazy  now listen to this line  dude  mankind good to have you  at the love shack  hi dude  thanks for having me here  the pleasure is all mine  you really are eye candy  for the chicks dude  eye candy for the chicks  you gotta tell me about  this wacky man  I'll tell anyone  dude  as much as I've dreamed  about destroying  Hunter Herschel  I know you have  I know you have  there's very horrible things  that I'd like to do to him 
[02:07:00]  I know you will  I know you can't  I'm so confused about it even more  who is it man  there's someone who's willing  to do even worse things  than I am  oh no  are you thinking  what I think  you're thinking  I think I am  thinking what you think  I think you're thinking  can you bring him out  manning  here he comes  where is he  cactus jack  what  this is impossible  what  Triple H is freaking out  he's yelling at the ref  he's yelling at the ref  because it's Madison Square Garden 
[02:07:30]  and Mrs. Foley's little boy  bye bye  bye bye  why is Triple H so angry  I guess cactus jack  was a mystical figure  he wouldn't even think  to be real at that point  not a new york brother  it was not just a change of shirt  and there comes cactus jack  that's insanity  nice man  well you spent all that time  and they just showed it  on the big screen 
[02:08:00]  behind everybody  why would Triple H run  right into the garbage pail  he thought  it was a mistake  I would do it  oh man  he ran right into it  but you're holding it up  there's no way  he'll use that garbage can  no way  called my bluff  what  he called your bluff  so Vince was afraid  because it didn't happen  on the WWE  he didn't think  that the heat would be there  yeah he didn't know  if that translated  I mean the truth was  you know when I was mankind  it was a different  type of look  and you know  in order to make it look  like I was pulling my  I did pull my hair out 
[02:08:30]  but I pulled like  from the ends  I didn't actually wrench  it out of my hair  right  you know  it was believable enough  that I mean  I was every night  pulling hair  and throwing it  and then I would like  carve the little divots  you know with a brazier  so I mean  not to draw blood  but here's a good picture  Sam's got up there  I mean it looked pretty  yeah you got  a big bald patch  and you got that mask on  yeah you know  I would like go into  like a 7-11 or something  at 2.30 in the morning 
[02:09:00]  and the guy there  with your fucking hair  I have a black guy  my hair's halfway  down my back  I could divots  out of my head  that's a great shot  I would just assume  they knew who you were  though  well they  unless they knew  Cactus Jack  unless they were  those guys watching  WCW at the time  they didn't really  know who I was  I mean I'd tuck my hair  up under a hat  when we'd go to the airport  a lot of the guys  they'd fly  the fans would flock  to the other guys  and I was kind of  left alone  so they didn't think  that the percentage  of people who knew  would be substantial 
[02:09:30]  enough to you know  create that big reaction  but they were wrong  yes they were  they were dead wrong  and you're doing  comedy tonight right  I want to make sure  people get the plug  yeah man yeah  I'm doing it  with Bob Levy  and Otto and George  fuck that's a good show  yeah it's a good show  right  oh man  this is the one  where we're hoping  I've got  we've talked about this  before when I've been on  it's like yeah  we like that guy  we know he's funny  on your show  but I don't know  I'll spend $20  like to stand in line  and get his autograph 
[02:10:00]  but not $20  to sit in a chair  and listen to him  yeah what the fuck  but we're gonna turn  that around today  well we I think  that this might be  getting a lot of  the fence sitters  to go okay  well even if he sucks  you know  where you at  where you at  we're at the  Sanders Mansion  in Scotia New York  which is right near  Albany  so it's pretty cool  pretty cool venue  yeah yeah  and the reason I  you know what  I saw this Henry Winkler  book here  and I brought it in  because I feel like  he's a kindred spirit 
[02:10:30]  did you know  that he has co-written  17 novels  what  for children  and what do you think  of when you see him  the Fonz  he's the Fonz  he's the Fonz  no matter how many  novels he writes  yeah  no matter how many  laughs I get  when I come here  Sam's still gonna play  that stupid dude  look  see  but you went back  to wrestling too  Henry Winkler  hasn't gone back  to the Fonz thing  you know  emotionally  you're doing more  wrestling lately  I think reunion show  I did  I got a tweet 
[02:11:00]  from the Fonz  on Christmas  bald Richie Cunningham  and fucking  old Fonzie  that'd be great  I want to see Chuck  Chuck finally comes back  the older brother  whatever happened to Chuck  is that actor  even still alive  no  he killed himself  during their seventh season  he's like  I can't believe  he's like the  Dunkelman of the 70s  just fucking  threw it all away  but the weird thing is  was there anyone  bigger than Fonzie  you think  on television  as a character  I mean he was so massive  yeah that was huge 
[02:11:30]  so massive  there's a point where  when Fonzie went back  and got his GED  yeah  that ruined everything  that was  no well  what ruined is  when he got married  and he put a beard  not that the beard  isn't working for you  but  but when Fonzie  got the diploma  like thousands of people  of teenagers  who dropped out  went back  and got their diploma  yeah but it made  for shitty  that is sad  why would you do that  just because  a TV character  did it  that's why I got 
[02:12:00]  my library card  you're such a  good person  man you are  such a good person  you look at that  like that's cool  I look at it  as being douchey  it's terrible  that's because  you haven't gone back  and got your GED  exactly  and I didn't  I really should do that  I hear even a GED  could kick your salary  up a little bit  I should get that  the Fon's got his  you should get yours  take that down the hall  show the guys  look  look  hey management  the episode  I tweeted about  was one of my favorite 
[02:12:30]  of all Christmas episodes  remember the one  where Fonzie's too proud  to admit he has  no one to spend  no one to spend  he makes up the story  about having a family  in Waukesha  and he's just alone  with a can of like beans  with a pork and beans  ravioli  something shitty  and he's like  yeah  hey  merry Christmas  hey  one more time  and then he won't  actually go out  and he won't give him  like the big thank you  but he'll say  Richie  give me like the little toy  you know  punches  hey  it's for having  all your freckles 
[02:13:00]  in the right place  that's beautiful  that's great  so I got a tweet  back from the Fonz  and he said  hey that was  one of the first shows  that featured Fonz  it was up until then  you know  he was in the windbreaker  he didn't actually say much  didn't really talk  yeah  I saw one of those  episodes recently  where he was in the windbreaker  barely there  he's like an aside  a guest star  that the credit  was at the end of the show  and it was one of my  favorite episodes  where Mr. C  has his friend  from his army buddy  come over  he's the black guy 
[02:13:30]  and he's getting married  and asks Mr. C  to be the best man  and the black guy  comes to the house  and it is  one of the most racist episodes  I've ever seen  like  Mrs. C is all nervous  because when he walks  in the door  she just went shopping  she's holding  a watermelon  and Mr. C  introduces the black friend  and she's like  oh we always have  watermelon  and fried chicken  and it's like  and then a neighbor  comes over  and the black guy  is in the kitchen  and she has to use  the phone for some reason 
[02:14:00]  and Mr. C goes  oh yeah go inside  and use the phone  and she walks in the kitchen  and she's like  there's someone  in your kitchen  like he's robbing  the joint  then the cop  the guy went out  for a walk  to clear his mind  and there's a knock  on the door  and Mr. C opens the door  there's a cop  holding the black guy's arm  going  this man says  he's a friend of yours  I saw him walking  around the neighborhood  it was just racist  after racist joke  and situation  how much did you love it  I loved it  I turned it off  before the sweet ending 
[02:14:30]  where everybody  goes together  to make it a good episode  I was hoping  they would just  run him out of town  with pitchforks  and torches  and they went back  and they explored  the racial issue again  with sticks  and nobody would  come to the party  at Richie's house  and then Fonzie went  and tried to threaten them  and remember  Ralph Mouth  wouldn't even go  Ralph was like  Ralph was a racist  he was hanging around  with Bag more  than Ron Howard did  yeah he  get Bag in the studio  Bag would be  fucking the greatest  Bag was like 
[02:15:00]  on that show  he could have been  like Newman was  the sign type  there was like  is he one of the friends  and you don't think  he was thinking that  when he was watching  Seinfeld  he was like  I could have been  I could have  could have been  that guy  could have been  that guy  I was almost that guy  and Mr. C  had to give Fonzie  the speech  Fonzie said  I'll be back  over there  I'll have this place  I do a terrible Fonzie  no it's good  it's really good  I'm closing my eyes  I'll be over there  in five minutes  I'll have this speech  Sylvester Stallone  Fonzie  and then Mr. C 
[02:15:30]  sits and says  no you will not  and he has to preface  what he says  by saying Fonzie  you are the coolest  there is no doubt  about that  but he tells him  that racism  has a longer history  than cool  than cool  and Fonzie's like  yeah Mr. C  yeah you know  racism isn't cool  eat your veggies  and go to school  get your diploma  cool only started  with Miles Davis  by racism  racism  there she is 
[02:16:00]  with the watermelon  and yeah he comes in  hey I'm here  I'm home Marion  my old army buddy  Fred Washington  my wife  Fred Washington  Freddie Boom Boom  Washington  it's nice to meet you  Fred  thank you  oh this is a surprise  I mean I didn't  look at you  I mean we didn't  expect  what I mean is  we have watermelon  all the time  oh god  shit  what ex-football player  is that by the way  isn't that  isn't that Shaft  or something  like Fred Williamson

[02:24:00]  oh yeah  ah the 70s  it's great  they're drinking  smoking  eating high cholesterol food  you didn't touch it  over and over again  no it was  my brother was in the room  I was in the cover  he knew what the  fully love seat was for  clandestine  older brother  yeah older brother  see he knew what  the fully love seat  was all about  and it was just like  two weeks earlier  I was watching  The Great Santini  and my biggest problem  there was  I was trying not to cry  in front of my parents  when the tumor was shot 
[02:24:30]  you know  an old red  shot tumor  oh yeah  I forgot that  do you remember that  with his honey jars  don't you squirt  some out for me  come here  come on  where's daddy's little baby at  come here  hitting him with a basketball  you're gonna squirt  squirt  squirt  yeah  this obscure movie  that was then taken  by uh  yeah  by Austin Powers  yeah yeah  you're gonna squirt  he had no idea  he was paying tribute  it's right  you buddy  come on  can we go back  to Deval  was great  man  he was amazing 
[02:25:00]  he was unbelievable  he's fucking good  in everything  let's go back  to jerking off  though  oh jeez  when you finally  figured out  the fucking  how that works  your whole life  changed  we've talked about  it on the show  oh yeah  all your hobbies  go away  and everything else  fuck your stupid  bicycle  yeah  the microscope  went away  my fucking  chemistry set  all that shit  was like  what is this  garbage  I was wasting  my time  with  I could have  been jerking  my dick  that was a  life change  yeah  here's a  no more baseball  cards  I haven't done 
[02:25:30]  it yet  but it addresses  the rumors  that we all  grew up  hearing  about  a certain  rock and roll  singer  who needed  to have  his stomach  pumped  right  of course  we've all  heard that  sexual acts  on stage  which  you know  is just  completely  rational  just  you know  it's so  believable  take a quick  break  extend the  drums  all the way  below  my bad  mates  I think  I should  go to  the hospital  I got to  go to  the fucking  hospital  how do you  think that  story got 
[02:26:00]  so out of  control  it's gotta be  based on  some little  tidbit  all I know  is that I  believed it  wholeheartedly  until that  great moment  of truth  for reasons  I didn't  quite understand  I felt  myself  about two  weeks  after Claudia  Jennings  just stroking it  why I went  to the toilet  bowl  like I didn't  even know  what I was  doing  it's like  instinct  yeah  and then  I felt  it was like  it was like  the orgasm  that all  other orgasms  have failed  to live up  to  that first 
[02:26:30]  unexpected  one  oh my  goodness  what the  fuck  is this  we've been  chasing that  orgasm  ever since  it's even  like a little  cherry pain  like you  shoved a  pencil in  your deck  hole  you just  finally opened  up the  hose  given what  we'd heard  about  that  rock  and roll  singer  literally  had to  need  his stomach  pumped  I thought  there'd be  like a  quart and a  half of  fluid  it looked  like a  drop of  Elmer's  glue  floating down  to the  bottom of  the bowl  and that's  when I  started to  re-examine  the  story 
[02:27:00]  how many  people  would this  take  where you  would actually  need your  fucking  stomach  pumped  the math  doesn't  work  wow  that's  pretty  fucking  cold  that's  odd  though  that's  what  came  into  your  head  the  second  you  came  everything's  a lie  everything's  been a lie  now  that is a  moment where  you get a lot  more clarity  as far as  everything goes  sex and 
[02:27:30]  those rumors  about sex  I had such  weird thoughts  as a kid  you have  these weird  thoughts and  misconceptions  about sex  you hear little  bits and pieces  about it  and try to  piece it all  together in  this puzzle  with some  missing parts  and I  actually thought  to get a girl  pregnant  you had to  wear a  rubber  because the  stuff that  got her  pregnant was  on the  condom  I thought  there was  something on  there  and you  had to  put it  in her  ass  so 
[02:28:00]  thank god  I figured  it out  so you  were really  young  yeah that  was like  seven years  old  I had the  same thing  that me and  my friends  we would  actually  start a  club formed  around a  dirty magazine  like alright  now we have  it  we take it  out here to  the woods  no one comes  here  we had the  same thing  we had a  box stroll  we had a  treasure trove  my mom ended up  finding my  cachet like when 
[02:28:30]  they finally took  down our old  shed  that's a kid's  prison money  that's cigarettes  in prison to a  kid  there's fucking  playboys  anything that  was even more  hardcore than  playboy  but I remember  being like very  young like that  in elementary  school and  think that  sucking tits  was fucking  right so  then at a  certain point  I thought to  myself I  can do this  and then when  we saw fuck  pics I was  like what  all bets are  off here  what is this  he's pissing  in her  what the hell 
[02:29:00]  are these  sick bastards  doing  degenerates  right  why isn't he  sucking her  tits  the first time  I ever saw  any like in  a playboy  it was a  woman's laying  on a bed  and she's  naked  and a guy  was in a  tuxedo next  door  and I'm like  I guess I'll  get a tux  you know what  I mean  it was a real  black tie affair  I'm like I don't  even know where  to get that  I don't know  why I had the  immediate thing  of like well I 
[02:29:30]  guess sex is  coming any day  for me now  and I better  be prepared  I don't want to  fuck this up  yeah yeah  you had to know  how to suck a  tit  and wear a  tuxedo  yeah  wow  there's just  those weird  misconceptions  man  and as a  kid you didn't  know what the  end game was  right  but you knew  something was  going on  there was a  girl down the  street when I  was I had to be  in kindergarten  man it was  weird but there  was a girl down  the street and  we used to go  into the shed  behind her house  and just show  each other our 
[02:30:00]  asses  like she would  just turn around  and pull her  pants down  and I would  turn around  pull my  pants down  and we'd  look over our  shoulders and  I would look  at her ass  and she'd  look at mine  and we'd  just kind of  stand there  and that was  sex  it was  beetle sex  was there a  spreading of  the cheeks  there was  nothing  except  just like  holding your  shirt up  over your  ass  pulling the  pants down  to the knees  and looking  over your  shoulder  oh Sam's  got a number  of that girl  and I knew 
[02:30:30]  something was  really cool  about this  but I had  no idea  what it was  I didn't know  what the  progression was  after that  I didn't  feel the need  or urge  to touch it  or anything  I just  this is great  to look at  you know what  the shame  here is  this is  completely  appropriate  for like  12  13  and 14  year old  boys  can we  get the  word out  that we  are clearing  up  misconceptions  yes  we're  helping  this is  another one  that just  goes to show  how confused  kids could be  is like  I remember  we were like  10 or 11  and we would  be talking  about women 
[02:31:00]  or girls  in our classes  and we would  actually use  this language  we're like  hey you know  who I'd love  to rape  and I think  that we never  had it in our  heads that a  girl would want  this  so we just  thought  I guess we're  going to have  to be raping  them someday  they're never  going to want  me to put  this in there  so it has  to be raped  and we were  like she's  not even  rapable  I really will  tell you  I'm serious  about this  it's awful 
[02:31:30]  that a boy  is confused  you think  it's even worse  or is it better  with the internet  because if you're  a little kid  you can see  fool porn  which was  I don't know  if you can even  judge it now  in hindsight  I think it's worse  in that people  think  I always drew  the equation  with pro wrestling  and porn  and that  this is like  it's a variation  like Sam does  it's like the  fantasy world  of what fighting 
[02:32:00]  could be  this is what  come on  but no  believe it to  the professionals  the difference is  now people see  UFC and they go  oh ok I get it  that's what the  real fighting is  but yet  the porn stuff  has come to be  a self fulfilling  prophecy  where you can  make that  what it is  so that  teenagers are  walking up  you know  it used to be  I mean if you  were lucky enough  if you were  lucky enough  to have a woman  or you know  a girl  who was willing 
[02:32:30]  to do that  sexual act  it never came  without a please  and probably  many of them  it was always  something magical  that a woman  could do  to a guy  it wasn't something  that a guy  walked up  held her ears  and made her  and so I  you know  honestly  my daughter's 18  I think  I'm going to  show her  I'm going to  just say  watch this  I'm not going to  watch it  and I'm going to  come back  and say  nobody ever  does that 
[02:33:00]  no one does  no one does  do you understand  these days  and I remember  growing up  it was  to get a blowjob  was a fucking  lotto  it was winning  the fucking lottery  it just didn't happen  yeah  it always hurt  my jaw  it's just one  of those things  that just didn't  always happen  and now it just  seems to be a  prerequisite to  dinner  or something  it just  it just  happens  it's a given  it's just a given 
[02:33:30]  it's the appetizer  it's like here it is  whoa look  I'm being blown  but back then  it just didn't  fucking happen  and when it  started happening  you're like  holy shit  this is happening  I still remember  yeah  sophomore in college  the girl told me  I'd look better  with my shorts off  and I had a Fonzie  poster on my wall  every weekend  for me  every weekend  was a Seeger song  every fucking  weekend  was a Seeger song  for me  I was in the woods  this one song  yeah  half a song  look too tall 
[02:34:00]  could have used  a few pounds  yeah  she had points  all her own  sitting way up high  way up  firm and high  that is like  the fucking  worst thing  about becoming  an adult  is that you're  not drinking  a keg  in a cornfield  anymore  it's just like  those fucking  wood kegs  where you're just  you're traveling  through the woods  to get to a keg  and then suddenly  there's 50 people  drinking there  was like unbelievable  why don't we do that  still  deforestation 
[02:34:30]  has killed our  parties  hey listen  Mark Cuban's  10 minutes out  and I don't  want to forget  about the money  that Sam owes  McFoley  oh shit  you've been reminding  Sam about this  meanwhile  Sam has been  exploring  the myth  and the origin  of the myths  of the stomach  pumping  celebrities  I like the list  of people  who have alleged  to have been  this person  Rod Stewart  Elton John  David Bowie  Mark Almond  Mick Jagger  Andy Warhol  Jeff Beck 
[02:35:00]  I never heard  about Jeff Beck  I never heard  about Jeff Beck  he's just trying  to get in  New Kids on the Block  that's bullshit  Bay City Rollers  Alanis Morissette  Lil Kim  Foxy Brown  Britney Spears  and Fiona Apple  Fiona Apple  come on  they're at least  attributing it  to females  now  yeah  it just kind of  ruins the entire  the mystique  of the whole thing  it's amazing  how a female  doing that  is like  nah that wrecks it  unless a guy  is sucking a dick  until he's got  to get his stomach  pumped  it's not fun  or hot 
[02:35:30]  or anything  they'll see  who killed  baby chicks  on stage  into the crowd  Alex Cooper  killed a baby  on stage  it was  the way I heard  it was a  gross off contest  between Gene Simmons  and Ozzy Osbourne  they were on stage  eating shit  yeah  and one upping  each other  it's like  now you're  like an old  vaudeville act  where they tap dance  and the other one  had to do it better  but it was eating shit  and killing babies  take off his  straw hat and cane  point it over 
[02:36:00]  to Gene Simmons  and eat diarrhea  on the stage  and lick it up  with Doritos  what a fucking show  I was there  in court tonight  I was there  don't do that  lighters are all  up in the air  I hope he's going  to allow me  to plug something  oh yeah  go  go  well we do have  to go to commercial  are you giving  Mick Foley's money  or what Sam  yeah  alright  you're really going  to take money  from Sam  I gave it to him  this is craziness  what's the money  Sam

[02:39:30]  that game  all of a sudden  you're doing  stand up  wow  I've had  a lot  of mic  time  and  addressing  crowds  but there  are times  like this  a couple  weeks ago  I did  Nashville  and Birmingham  back to back  Nashville was  like a dream  and then Birmingham  not sure  what you know  not sure  what happened  like I felt  like I had to  address the fact  that there's  YouTube clip  of me  doing my  rendition  of Sweet Home  Alabama  where  Ronnie Van Zandt  is having  trouble  finding  something  positive  to say 
[02:40:00]  it  and out of  frustration  he's like  I'm like  this  bleeping  close  to having  a hit  bleeping  song  the only  problem  is I can't  think of  one  fucking  thing  to say  about it  and he  finally looks  up and he  goes  wow  the sky  is kind  of blue  so I thought  I had to  address it  you know  like the elephant  in the room  I addressed it  in Birmingham  and like  they didn't even  know I did it  so now  it was tough  to get them  back after I  went out there 
[02:40:30]  and admitted  I'd been  you know  no one has  ever done  well in  Birmingham  though  it's a known  fact  there's never  been anyone  who said  I do really  well in  Birmingham  yeah  no  can't happen  they're very  confused down  there  very confused  where's  Mark Cuban  he's on  his way  he just stopped  to buy something  on the way  a building  yeah  does he realize  it's Friday  we're getting  the hell out of  here  yeah right  please  Sam what do you  have built  on the screen  I was just  going to say  I don't know  if you guys  watch

[02:41:30]  you know  I think  this was the  one Wife Swap  where the  husbands were like  hey can we  keep this thing  going a little  while longer  my goodness  what do you  get for this  what do you  mean  oh  who did I  trade in  for  you can google  the guy  Antonio  Sabato Jr  I love him  so that felt  good you know  when I saw  the guy's face  my wife's  living with him  for a week  I did a  wife swap  with Newt  Gingrich  but it was  years ago  you know what 
[02:42:00]  I don't even  think it's a  big deal  but it's  coming back  now  everybody's  talking about  it  wait you got  to bring  him home  razor sharp  there  that's like  not doing  the guy  justice  where's his  wife  oh my god  so he  came home  with you  my wife  left LA  spent the  week with  him  and his  wife  a TV  week  or a  real  week  it was  like  six  days  you know  yeah  it was  and then

[02:43:00]  ABC  they're  not looking  for conflict  they just  want to see  how people  get along  and then  the only  thing  that hurt  a little  bit  was they  have a  psychologist  come over  and give  you like  a 500  questionnaire  to make  sure that  you either  are or  are not  going to  fall apart  on national  tv  and she  wouldn't  tell us  who the  guy was  you're not  supposed to  know until  the show  starts  the only  thing she  tells us  is they  picked out  the perfect  couple  this guy  is so  opposite of  you  and I was  like oh  really  she is one  of the most  handsome men 
[02:43:30]  in Hollywood  and I  just look  like oh  completely  opposite of  me  she didn't  get it  his body  is unbelievable  thank you  I have an  opportunity so  I have to  say this  Mark Cuban  is in the  shitter  that seems  to be  basically a  billionaire  he might be  making number  one  he might be  doing the  number one  that's not  confirmed  he could be  or he might  be making  number two  we have a  camera crew  here  and we  ought to  investigate  so when  is your  wife swap  on  it's 
[02:44:00]  the 31st  it's the  last episode  but I think  the State  of the Union  is on  the 24th  so we  are the  grand finale  that should  be short  though  State of the  Union  it's not  good  it's been  better people  look outside  she's hot  though  she was  great  you have  her like  scrub your  toilets or  something  you know  what I  felt really  bad about  it  because  our  little  our  dog  had the  runs  that  week  yeah  no no no 
[02:44:30]  Ronnie  stay  he goes  there  where you  going  what are  you doing  oh yeah  come on  Mr. Bennington  Mr. Bennington  so she cleaned  up after your  dog  that was part  of the deal  she had to  do what  my wife  would normally  be doing  and it  didn't seem  fair  Mark Cuban  how are you  Mark  good to see  you again  buddy  it's been  a long  time  take a seat  right over  there  next to the  wonderful  Mick Foley  yes sir  the fucking  Mavericks  finally won  it  that's what's up  that's what's up  that is like 
[02:45:00]  so cool  yeah it was  amazing  you guys want  some dirt on  Mark  oh yeah  oh right off the bat  you know Mick Foley  obviously  because you're a  wrestling fan  right  yeah of course  do you know  why I've been  pulling for the  Mavericks for  years  honestly  do you know  why  because in  all my years  and I've never  had this verified  so you're the  guy to talk to  all my years  of you know  wrestling  going to arenas  where professional  sports teams  play  the only  place where we  have ever been  given the privilege 
[02:45:30]  of dressing  in the home  team's dressing  room  is in Dallas  is that right  I'm sure they were  taken care of  yeah  I would tell people  that's got to  come from the top  yeah absolutely  we've never had  that anywhere  and let's talk  about the dressing  room because I  was lucky enough  he treated me  like a fucking  king  he probably  doesn't even  remember  me and my  brothers were  in Dallas  doing our thing  and we got to  see the locker  room  you saw it  right  and everyone  said there's  not a locker  room like it  in the NBA 
[02:46:00]  maybe now there  is after all  these years  no they try  but I keep  on upgrading  everyone had  their own  flat screen  TV and everything  it was nice  now here was  my fear  I would go  around and be  like I don't  know somebody's  going to steal  a pair of  sneakers  ruin the whole  thing  no no you guys  are always so  cool right  because I did  in 2003  Randy Orton  beat the shit  out of me  and then  a couple years  ago Seamus  threw me  through a table  because Vince  would always  call me up  and say you  got to help  promote  and my rule  was my rule 
[02:46:30]  with Vince  was one you  got to let me  hit somebody  and you got to  let me be hit  and that was  the deal  so they always  look good  you do it  well man  taking some  bumps  anytime Mark  comes on  you know  we're getting  sports center  oh yeah  that's why  they have me  on because I'm  the only idiot  dumb enough to do  we're legit  this is great  wow we appreciate  it man  and I've always  you know  I always thought  that was the  coolest thing  I never knew  that  no one would  let you  actually be in  we're always in  the visitors  what the fuck 
[02:47:00]  is that about  because you know  there's stuff there  I mean the jerseys  are there  and I bet  somebody took  something over the  yeah the visitors  locker rooms are  always horse shit  yeah I don't doubt it  you're not going to  make them comfortable  right  yeah fuck that  I hear you make  the water just  slightly colder  all sorts of  little tricks  oh really  I've heard the  tricks over the  years yeah  the only problem  is we were so  relaxed when we  were in Dallas  we'd go out  there and stink  up the arena  yeah  I feel so loved  I miss Dallas  I haven't been  there in a while  it's a great town 
[02:47:30]  it is a great town  absolutely  what are you doing  Mark  well shit  I got so much  I'm hearing some  things  I got Shark Tank  premiere tonight on  ABC  8 o'clock Eastern  7 Central  can we cross  promote our  ABC shows  I've got Wife Swap  next week  yeah Wife Swap  alright Wife Swap  Shark Tank  alright bring it  on man  Shark Swap  Shark Swap  yeah  Wife Swap  yeah  Wife Swap  yeah  just keep ABC  on  so Shark Tank  coming on tonight  if you haven't seen

[02:49:00]  wow  how does that get going  amazing  and so  you know  but the guy  that's the whole thing  right  in this particular case  the guy is just  a genius promoter  now is it a real business  that's what we'll find out  when we watch the show  you know  we had another guy  come in  that  oh my goodness  we had  I'm trying not to  I have to figure out  how to say it  without giving everything away  look at you  but  another chick comes on  and all she does  is paint pretzels  right  and so  with different flavors 
[02:49:30]  and stuff  and I'm sitting there  eating like a pig  because this stuff is good  right  and then you got to dig in  is it a business or not  but the whole idea  is that these are people  that just had these unique ideas  and then started making money with it  but the question is  is it a business  or is it just a passion  where you can just make a little bit  and so we go into these guys  and then  another guy  have you seen those  power balance bracelets  that people wear  yeah  total scam  right  oh yeah  oh so  I've got ten of them  a hundred bucks a pop  right 
[02:50:00]  guy comes in  trying to pitch us on this stuff  some of the sharks  thought it was real  so not only did I have to just destroy this guy  but I had to destroy the other sharks too  so it gets really good  some of these people  also have invested  hundreds and thousands  of dollars  of their own money  of their own money  and they're just like working people  and they're like  this is their last shot  right  so they're on there going  oh they're crying  some of it I think is great  because like  I'm here to sell  five percent of my company  for nine hundred thousand dollars  I'm like  what the hell are you thinking 
[02:50:30]  right  no it's really good right  because it's really  especially good  when a guy walks in  with something crazy  like you said  you know  I've got this beer company  that I just haven't started yet  but it's going to be really good  and I want a million dollars  for three percent of my company  yeah  I'm like  are you kidding me  but then the other ones  where we all like it  and then we go to battle  when the sharks fight  that's when it gets fun  and they actually  the other sharks  kind of gang up on you  sometimes  because  they're a little jealous  yeah  you've got more money than them  you'll come in  harder than they come in 
[02:51:00]  always  so you'll see them whining  who are the other  sharks  anyone we know  yeah  Damon John  who started FUBU  who's great  he's great TV  across the board  yeah  I've seen the shark  Barbara Corcoran  who does real estate  here in New York  Robert Herkovich  who's a Canadian  computer guy  and Kevin O'Leary  who is also Canadian  and has a bunch  of financial businesses now  so a bunch of smart people  and so it gets going  nice  you've got the edge  the wrestling background 
[02:51:30]  so when it comes time  to tear someone  a new one  you know how it's done  I just put them down  you know  put the sleeper hold on them  and he can rock a mic  I can rock a mic  yeah  I've got a product  I'd like to propose  there we go  shark tank  shark tank  shark tank  right here  we're the sharks  right now  we had an accident  last New Year's Eve  where my dog  unfortunately  was dropped on its head  by the person watching it  and after a few days  you know  of irreparable  brain damage  dog  we had to put her  under  three days ago 
[02:52:00]  that's terrible  three days ago  after 13 months  of freeze drying  a box came to our door  and it was the actual dog  not a stuffed dog  you went with that  we went with the freeze drying  that's creepy  no we thought it'd be creepy  but now the dog  Juju sits on the  she sits on the counter  it looks exactly  not the counter  our dresser  looks exactly like  the Juju  and we go over there  and we pet her  yeah  you know what  it could be a business 
[02:52:30]  though right  it is a business  it's a joint business  people knew  what type of joy  and happiness  usually they get them  where they used to  sleep on the floor  and just put them back  in their spot  curl them up  and then they  that's creepy  I had this done  with my dad  and he rides shotgun  we just drive around town  HOV lane  that was my wall up tall  after I popped him  you really did that Mick  we did man  my wife thought  she's not creepy  and my daughter  she burst into tears  she said  I don't want to look  I don't want to look  and then she went in 
[02:53:00]  and she was like  oh I'm flipping out  this is so crazy  but every time  we go in there  it's like  you know  it's a good positive thing  and it's not taxidermy  where it's  the fur  over a form  they freeze dry  it's the only thing  that's taken out  of the eyes  and the organs  even the blood  is freeze dried  see now it's  sounding weird  where are the eyes  and the organs though  don't you get those  still in a separate box  I fried them up  that's a good eating  you're not worried  it's going to come 
[02:53:30]  alive in the middle  of the night  oh man  pet cemetery  pet cemetery shit  you look over  and it's not on  the dresser anymore  I hadn't lost  my cell phone  ten days ago  which is tough  in today's world  I could you know  see if my wife  could maybe  text over  oh man  someone's got  Mick Foley's phone  yeah man  wow  what kind of secrets  are in there  what are you waiting for  any sexting  you know  I've got that  that cheapness issue  I'm dealing with  alright  I forgot about that  you're sitting next  to a billionaire  I know  an actual billionaire 
[02:54:00]  yeah  wow  say it louder  I'll brag for Mark  171 on the Forbes 400  are you moving up or down  I don't know  I mean  honestly  I got it  I got enough  I'd like to make more  but man  I ain't grinded  you're using it  productively  and you're out there  for me  yeah  yeah  good  here's the thing  though  Mark makes every day  a good day  you know what I mean  like there's a lot of guys  out there  you see  and you know who they are  because we know  some of them  they made their money 
[02:54:30]  and they're still  bitching  miserable  there was a guy  I'm not going to say  you own a sports team  and I won't say  where it is  a football team  and that's in Washington  and I was up  in the thing there  and I saw him  just having the worst  possible day  TV wasn't working  and he's stopping  like Rumpelstiltskin  and I'm like  what's the problem  I mean how could you  I mean I look at  I'm the luckiest  motherfucker in the world  right  I mean if I can't  have a good time  then I'm an idiot  right  and so you just  gotta enjoy it  every day  and you know  my dad  my dad's 86 
[02:55:00]  and he's a freak  he just gets out there  he's still partying  and having a good time  and he's like  Mark today's the youngest  you're ever going to be  you better damn well  live like it  damn  and so I get it from him  you know it gets me  as far as  that must be easy to say  when you have a son  like Mark Q  yeah right  you know when you know  it's like real wealth  that friggin jet  the jet  no wait  which one  exactly  the second I start  feeling good about myself 
[02:55:30]  just in the toilet  I am  I'm a roofer  right  putting shingles on there  can I compare you  can I ask about your  you know the  how things run on your jet  because when I was  an announcer  I was given the option  of flying back  on the McMahon jet  and I conveniently  always had an excuse  as to why I had to  fly out in the morning  Vince won't let anyone  sleep on the jet  why  I don't know  now that would  kind of weird me out  too right  because you can  you know  you get used to it  it's kind of like  a house in the air  because you have it  because you fly a lot  right 
[02:56:00]  and so I've got  everything set up  exactly the way  what do you got  in your jet  just so we could  live through you  I mean it's a normal  G550 plus  you know  it's just the run  of the mill  a couple of the  bells and whistles  though  golly  it's got the  bed so you can  sleep  it's got  direct TV  so I can watch  the games  and NBA TV  it's got internet  access  it's like a flying  office  and it's got  you know  the fold out  everything  so I can chill  and I've got  three kids  so they  you know  they get to be  comfortable  it's got everything 
[02:56:30]  I need  can I sing a song  a line from  Rapper's Delight  sure  I've got to call  the TV  so I can see  the Knicks  play basketball  that's a fully  Cuban rap  that's a very  strange moment  but once now  you'll never be  able to fly  commercial again  you have to  you know  actually I kind  of make myself  fly commercial  every year  so just kind  of you know  it's kind  of a reality  check  so you know  how the rest  of us live  Southwest  you know  flying out of  Dallas  how cute is that 
[02:57:00]  because it's  horrible  it's horrible  to fly commercial  now  yeah  oh what's  even worse  they see me  coming right  so you know  I'm always the  guy in the booth  that they're  checking out  it's brutal  where your jet  takes off  when you get  there  you pull right  up  everywhere  but like  do you have  a problem  going through  the body  scan  nah  I do  you know  why  you have  a small  penis  well  I'm not  convinced  there's not  going to be  a best  of celebrity 
[02:57:30]  body scan  that's coming  to ABC  by  I was talking  to my wife  this is you  know  a little  something  different  but it's  the same  idea  about feeling  inadequate  in public  but I was  talking to my  wife about  maybe getting  a vasectomy  except that I  was you know  a little shy  about the nurses  seeing me  the way I was  so I was  thinking of  getting a penile  extension  first  but wouldn't  they have 
[02:58:00]  to  yes  they would  I hear they  just pull a  little more  out  it's already  in there  they just  pull it out  they bring  it out  it's like  taking a  building  out of  the basement  what about  the structure  then  you guys  know an  awful lot  about this  we've been  doing this  radio thing  a long time  we know  everything  you're doing  something with  Seacrest now  it was announced  yesterday  what's that  about  it's um  you know  I have a TV  network  called HDNet  and we've been  we need some  shows by the way  I'll stop you  right there  no absolutely  let's start 
[02:58:30]  talking  they actually  get into a car  and literally  laugh all the  way to the  bank  both of them  that's the  show  no so  we're  it's just  time to  grow HDNet  further  so um  we've  HDNet's been  working on  trying to go  live with as  much as we  can  live concerts  live everything  that's awesome  inside MMA  just like  you know  you guys  know the  benefits  of when  things happen  you guys  are live  right  and you  go right  to it  and just  that immediacy 
[02:59:00]  makes it all  the better  right  and you  don't get  that on TV  outside of  news and sports  and so  and business  and so  we want to  be able to  create a  network  Ryan and I  that's based  on a live  experience  towards pop  culture  because if  something  happens  you see a  tweet  or you  hear something  on Opie and  Anthony  that's in  the entertainment  world  right  then you go  to the website  you go to TMZ  or whatever  and all you  see maybe  is a grainy  video  you know  now  everybody's got  these big screen  TVs  we want to  be the  destination  where when  something happens  in the pop  culture world 
[02:59:30]  you go right  to access.tv  and we'll be  live  we're building  the studio  out in LA  live  right by  Staples Centers  and everything  so that  we'll have  anchors  we'll start  off with  kind of like  a sports  center  for pop  culture  and we'll  start off  with music  so let's  just say  Jay-Z  is playing  in Dallas  right  so we'll have  reporters out  there before  the concert  we'll go  in the green  room  hey Jay  what you got  lined up  for today  just like  NBA  we'll do  a live  look in  you know  like they do  at the NFL  so let's 
[03:00:00]  take you to  Dallas  Jay's got  his concert  going  hey AXS  welcome to  my concert  here in  Dallas  we're going  to do  this number  da da da da  boom  and the AXS  are happy  because it's  promotion  helps sell  tickets  we're happy  because it  gives people  a look  and access  to things  they couldn't  get  hence the  name AXS  and we  just think  it's a  different  approach  to networks  and then  the geek  side of me  we're going  to do  all the  new  technology  and all  that kind  of stuff  so that  you'll be  able to  interact  can Ryan  appear on  Shark Tank  and bring  up that  idea  will you 
[03:00:30]  be broadcasting  the actual  concerts  yes  in some  cases  yeah  like we  actually  started  doing  live  concerts  with  Ted  Nugent  of all  people  right  and so  Ted's  on there  what the  fuck  up HD  net  you know  but the  cool part  is like  right now  with social  media  like you  guys  follow  Twitter  and see  what's  going on  and people  go people  to people  if you  drop that  F-bomb  at an  NBA game  how much  would that  cost you  yeah  that happens  all the  time  he's calmer  these days  now that  he's got 
[03:01:00]  one of  those rings  exactly  they assign  someone to  that seven  second delay  right next  to me  I used to  love when  you carried  on  it makes  the game  better  I love  all that  I get  just as  intense  but they're  used to  me  now  can I  ask you  a question  about the  NBA  sure  do you  think the  announcers  are under  pressure  not to  draw attention  to obviously  bad calls  that affect  the game  absolutely  because I'll  see that  my son  he's a  guy he  really watches  he can call  a foul  before the  refs do  most of the  time  and we'll  see a 
[03:01:30]  call  that is  obviously  bad  and changes  the flow  of the game  and it's  like they  might show  a replay  but they  will never  dwell on  how bad  a call  and they rarely  even show  the replay  on bad  calls  now  maybe if  it's a  review  they won't  even show  the whole  marina  that drives  me nuts  when I go  to sporting  events  because you  love when  the crowd  goes  holy  we just  got fucked  that's what  I do  I give  the guy  the signal  show it  again  show it  again  really  so why  aren't  other places  doing it 
[03:02:00]  they don't  give a shit  right  I mean  it's not  because I'm  like you  I want to  get the  crowd as  revved up  as possible  because that's  part of the  experience  going to  a sporting  event  it's one  of the  few  places  where  everybody  even if  you don't  know the  people next  to you  can all  just like  stand up  and scream  good or  bad  right  I love  when athletes  act like  idiots  I love it  I love  all the  touchdowns  I love  it all  I love  to be in  a public  place  where I  can hug  strangers  I love  it all  and I don't  know why  the NFL  especially  is trying 
[03:02:30]  to control  all that  yeah  no fun  league  no man  it's not  fun  and the  NBA is  nothing but  attorneys  everybody's  just like  lawyers that  work at  the league  and so  they're  used to  finding  but yeah  now when I  do stuff  they might  find me  but they've  learned  they won't  announce it  right  so unless  I can get  some leverage  out of it  I'm not  going to say  anything  you guys  you ought to  get some  heat from  it  right  yeah  look at  this shit  he went to  the White  House  right  yeah  I had  a great  time at  the White  House  I mean  there's  nothing cooler  than you're  standing up  there wearing  a suit for  like first  time in years  and all of a 
[03:03:00]  sudden the  president's standing  up in front of  the White  House press  course and he's  giving me shit  right  he's like  well the Mavs  weren't scheduled  to come here  but Mark Cuban  decided to make  it happen  so I'm not  going to say  no to Mark  Cuban  yeah that's  the president  that's right  have you learned  how to shoot  yet  and so we  had gotten  some scoop  on him  and Jason's  like yo I  talked to your  coach from  high school  he says you  only go left  and you never  pass the ball  and is it  true they  called you  Barry the 
[03:03:30]  bomber  and so I  mean it was  cool man  these basketball  guys are going  back and forth  so it was  fun  what was your  thoughts on  Obama meeting  him  coincidence  that he only  goes left  yeah he goes  left  he can play  though right  Obama can play  right  supposedly  yeah  it's part of  he still gets  out there  he's a one  sport guy  but he definitely  I've seen him  on the court  he looks good  but it's weird  it doesn't  like he can't  throw a baseball  which is  oh no  I mean most  people if they  can play sports  they can play  every sport 
[03:04:00]  you're an athlete  but he  I guess maybe  from Chicago  he just doesn't  care about  anything  best presidential  pitch George W  very good  he can  he played in  college right  yeah  well he was also  drunken on drugs  so who knows  what he remembered  what's unusual  about that  yeah  but you know  Nixon used to  throw a Cuban  palm ball  and nobody  remembers it  that thing would  come down  and then rise  but nobody  remembers it  yeah  I'm excited  about this HD 
[03:04:30]  net mark  I gotta tell you  you know what  no we should  talk about it too  because we're  trying to figure out  what we want to  do in the morning  and you know  a lot of shows  but yeah  we're trying to  figure out  exactly how  we're gonna  go versus  east coast  versus west  coast and  the different  time zones  and you know  whether we  want more  talk more  music more  in studio  more we  haven't decided  yet so that's  part of the  process  you need an  east coast  and a west  coast  that's right  that's where  probably we're  gonna go  right which  is trying to  how we're  what direction  we're gonna  go  so we've  got six  months a year  to try to 
[03:05:00]  get that all  figured out  yeah at the  same time  WWE is trying  to launch their  network  you know  I've talked  to Vince  about that  that's not  as easy  as it used  to be  right  because  bandwidth  now on  these networks  you know  five years ago  you were seeing  new channels  pop up left  and right  now there's  nothing  right  because now  they want  to use all  that extra  space for  you know  on demand  and Netflix  competitor  and whatever  else  and so  it you know  having that  real estate  is good  for us  and Hnet  turning into  access  and still  Hnet movies  and you know  we're gonna  keep on growing  will you ever  retire  no what fun 
[03:05:30]  is that man  I only do  it if I like  it  because you  have a good  time just  working  exactly  you're making  fun  I think  the cool  thing too  is that  when people  twitter  like when  Rob Lowe  tweeted  something the  other day  about Peyton  and everybody  was on it  it's like  no celebrity  is ever  off anymore  they are  everybody  is on  the clock  24 hours  a day  so if  you just  take those  things  pull them  together  open up  the phones  what's going  on do you  believe Rob  boom  that's it  right there  and the whole  thing  it's just  live  in whatever 
[03:06:00]  stream of  consciousness  is going  on  right  because  it's easy  twitter's  easy  used to be  you had to  get a PR  person  or whatever  get a hold  of your  booker  now if you  guys see  something  tweeted  you're coming  to us  right  or you're  going to  wherever  you think  the story  is  hoping  for  exactly  right  exactly  sounds a lot  like my live  web show  that I do  live from the  compound  from my  basement  you're trying  out  a lot like  that  are you  trying out  for something  well it  is a show  a state  of the art  studio  in my  basement 
[03:06:30]  that I do  it's a  wonderful  HD  perfect  hopefully  it'll take  out TMZ  they're a  little behind  they will  be behind  they're a  whole day  behind  with their  TV show  that's exactly  the idea  right  when a big  fuck is  I'm going  to help  them out  big Hollywood  story  hits  you go  I'm going  to watch  TMZ  tonight  and they're  a day  behind  and you  can't even  watch it  that night  right  so you  go to  the website  and they  might have  some  great  they might  have a  clip  and that's  it  right  so you  want to  be able  to go  someplace  where you  know  they're  going to  be  covering 
[03:07:00]  it  live  and that's  where we  want to be  it's not  going to happen  overnight  but over the  next year  so that's  what we  want to do  yeah  good for you  cool man  yeah  and so fuck  it and then  newspapers are  just silly  now  like this  shit from  three days  ago that I  read online  we talk about  that all the  time  really  this is  the news  real news  I mean  you know  newspapers have  got to  obviously evolve  but there's  still going  to be  you know  you get  caught up  with so  much time  on your  phone  on your  tablet  on your  pc  right  that I  think  you got  to have  multiple  form  factors  right  you got  it  it's  good  to be able  to sit  down  and hold 
[03:07:30]  something  read  and I  think  even  kids  right  they're  going to  say  well  you know  as they  as you  get older  you have  less time  available  and you  just get  smarter  about how  you use  that  time  so I  don't  think  newspapers  go away  but I  think  they  continue  to  evolve  and like  one other  plug  like  I just  came out  with an  ebook  how to  win at  the sport  of business  so just  google  mark cuban's  book  and when  I mean  you know  like you  guys  people come  to you  why don't  you do  a book  why don't  you do  a book  and I'm  like  I'm not  going to  do a  real book  because I  don't  want to  have to  do  the whole  book  tour  thing  so I  just  did  an  ebook  it's  three  bucks  on  amazon  right  I don't 
[03:08:00]  have to  go out  and do  a tour  I got  to do  a tour  for  shark  tank  right  and get  out there  and have  fun  with you  guys  but for  the book  I just  tweeted  this guy's got  800 things  going on  you make  everyone feel  like lazy  slobs  800 things  going on  I think we should stay past 10 today  I know  I'm like  three minutes to the weekend  let's give it a little effort today  but all the stuff is changing  right  because to do the book  I got it done  like three hours  before it got published  to amazon  you know  I didn't have to  send stuff out to the bookstores 
[03:08:30]  right  when I  want to change something  I just change it  right  and then I just tweet  and I go online to discuss it  book radio  book radio  they have it here  believe it or not  on Sirius X  it's not on radio  what a great waste of bandwidth  we should bring that to the shark tank  and see what  there you go  book radio  in defense of the old fashioned book  I mean you could read a quick article  about Henry Winkler's love of fishing  right  it's true  118 pages  I want to be able to hold it  embrace it  I have no desire to hold a book anymore 
[03:09:00]  I don't mind  I like reading  but I don't want to hold the damn book  I don't feel comfortable  carrying a tablet into the bathroom  I mean  I can have 15 newspapers  and 12 books  hanging out there  but the tablet  and you could always wipe with it  if you're out of toilet paper  it wouldn't be the first time  rip a slow page out  we've got to ask you about the NBA  before we leave  who are you looking at this year  who are you worried about  you know  it's a crazy year  because of the lockout  so the regular season  I don't even think  really matters 
[03:09:30]  except for making the playoffs  because teams are so tired  they're playing back to back to back  we've had like 7 games  and 9 nights already  and you're going to have games  where the guys are so tired  you're a good team  and you get blown out  and so the regular season  there's not statement games  you're just going to grind your way through  win enough games  hopefully to make the playoffs  it's all about hitting your stride  yeah exactly  at the end  being healthy  and hitting your stride  exactly right  when the playoffs come  and you know  we've got a good squad  I think we'll be alright  you think now that times have changed  that there's too many games  in the NBA 
[03:10:00]  and baseball in general  yeah I mean  there are  but that's not going to change  just because of the economics  right  because football  every fucking game  matters  unbelievable  and I think in this day and age  if you knock down the NBA  I don't know  let's say 50 games  or baseball  well like 66 now  I mean we've got 66 now  and I feel like it's  a more exciting year already  it is right  the problem is  because every game  kind of counts a little more  it counts more  but the guys are so tired  right  and that's part of the problem  look it would be cool 
[03:10:30]  if we can cut the number of games  but the guys don't want to make less money  right  and you build these arenas  and you've got to have the dates  right  and that's part of the problem  and you know  if the economics were different  I'd agree with you  but you just can't make those numbers work  economically  you can't make it work  yeah exactly  because baseball  you're sitting there  it's June 1st  like this game means nothing  it is brutal  and yet the game's sub  baseball sells  as a live sport  so what do I know man  but baseball sells  going to the stadium  right  you know  it's just the experience  but baseball figured out  now it's an experience  oh you said sorry 
[03:11:00]  when you go to the stadium  there's all sorts of things  you get involved  everything but baseball  right  because there's so much downtime  look I love baseball  I love all sports right  but you know  going to baseball  is about hot dogs and beer  and chill with your boys  right  or your kids  wander around the concourse  a little while  maybe go to the hall of fame area  exactly  check out the girls  hang out with your boys  you got a fucking water slide  exactly right  and then there's a game  and then there's a game  and you feel like  you didn't miss anything  exactly right  but it's still fun  yeah  what do you think 
[03:11:30]  do you think LeBron's  ever going to win that ring  I hope not  he's a choke artist  you know  I'm not going to kill on LeBron  but  he's a choke artist  I'll tell you what  what is his problem  you think  he's a talented player  he's incredibly talented  right  and it's  I think people have  the wrong expectation  I think LeBron's smart  he's very smart  there's a reason why  he went to play  with Dwayne Wade  Dwayne Wade's a killer  right  you want to give Dwayne  even Chris Bosh said  you give Dwayne Wade  the ball at the end of the game  but you need somebody  to get Dwayne Wade  the ball  right  LeBron can do that  better than anybody  so he decided to be  number two though 
[03:12:00]  that's exactly right  he decided to be Pippen  that's okay  Patrice O'Neal said it  famously on our show  that's okay  is it though  as long as you know it  right  the only thing bad  for players  why would you want  to be Jordan  because that's not  his DNA  how many people  get to be Jordan  one so far  you know what I mean  like why not  play for a team game  you know  and Dirk's a killer  there's only a certain  number of guys  who have it in their DNA  that just have  that killer instinct  that no matter  what's going on  like the last game  when we closed out  the Heat  Dirk was like  one for twelve  in the first half  but come the second half 
[03:12:30]  boom  he was a killer  Dwayne Wade  when we played him  back in 2005  boom  he was a killer  LeBron was smart  enough to recognize  that's not him  I was pushing  for you guys hard  I'm like  I don't know  if these guys  got a chance  and then you turned  it around  I'll tell you what  everybody was hating  on Miami  you're right  we were the wrestling  moment  the great heel move  is the moment  that LeBron did the  oh my god  and it was like  how can you do that 
[03:13:00]  and that's why  I just thought  this is where Dirk  showed far more class  than I or anyone else  because I would  have gone to the  oh I think  I'm joking  but it was  that moment  where you're like  geez  it's kind of like  well this is an example  of post-racial America  because nobody  is disliking him  because he's black  they're disliking him  because he came across  and then it turns around  LeBron was the one choking  he had a horrible  series  it was our defense  I hear we got 
[03:13:30]  a rap bubble  Mark too  dude it's been years  we beg to have you on  all the time  I know I need to come in  we've got to make it a stop  because we love you  I will  there's a helipad on the roof  just landed right there  and take us with you  whatever  it's mcubin on Twitter  absolutely  he's a good one  to follow on Twitter  absolutely  Shark Tank Fridays  at 8 on NBC  and then of course  this HDNet thing  that we're going to  check out my book  closely at  in the book  How to Win at the Sport of Business  just google Mark Cuban's book  and it'll take you right to it  by the way  he's worth 2.3 billion dollars  that's just craziness
