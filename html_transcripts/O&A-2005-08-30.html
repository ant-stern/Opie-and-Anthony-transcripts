<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts – Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton – engaging in their characteristically vulgar banter directed at each other and their staff, Ben and Steve.  The conversation quickly shifted to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, focusing on what they perceived as media overhype of the New Orleans devastation compared to the damage in other areas, particularly Mississippi.  They heavily criticized Fox, CNN, MSNBC, and the Weather Channel for dramatic reporting and neglecting the plight of those outside of New Orleans.  This segment included a listener-submitted song about the Superdome's horrific conditions, a discussion of a controversial New York Post story about Brad Pitt juxtaposed with the hurricane’s death toll, and commentary on the irresponsible behavior of some who didn't evacuate. Opie's cockroach infestation became a significant topic, prompting numerous listener calls offering (often humorous) advice.  The show also featured humorous news clips, notably a tense on-air argument between a CNN anchor and a meteorologist (repeatedly interrupted with "Chad! Chad!"), which became a running joke throughout the broadcast.

The show continued with a discussion of a coworker, Chad, whose lengthy explanation of barometric pressure was interrupted by Carol, a situation the hosts found amusing and justified.  A caller, Jeff, then shared a story of his brother Mike yelling "Baba Booey" repeatedly inside the Superdome.  The conversation returned to the Hurricane Katrina aftermath, detailing the dire conditions within the Superdome, particularly the flooded and non-functional toilets. Graphic descriptions of the bathrooms' state were shared, accompanied by news reports illustrating the chaos and destruction.  A new, poorly-received Ramon commercial (featuring a golfer hitting golf balls into dog feces) was debuted and heavily criticized.  The "Assault on the Media" contest was highlighted, showcasing listener-submitted videos of people disrupting news reporters, with Sonny Ferrelli and "Stephen the Lion Man" receiving special mention.  Prizes included a MiFi device, dinner with E-Rock, a studio visit, and Bon Jovi tickets. The segment concluded with commentary on funny newspaper comics, ridicule of Harriet Cole's advice column, and graphic previews of an upcoming segment featuring a taser video and Tom Sizemore sex tapes, including speculation on an Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt publicity stunt.

The next segment featured a caller, Jacob, describing being tased multiple times. This transitioned into a discussion of a Tom Sizemore sex tape, with Martini Steve (a frequent guest) providing explicit details.  Numerous audio clips from the tape were played, showcasing Sizemore's rambling and often incoherent commentary during sexual acts with multiple women. The explicit content included descriptions of sexual acts and Sizemore’s drug use and legal troubles. A separate, unrelated audio clip of men being kicked in the groin by a dominatrix was also played. The focus then shifted back to Hurricane Katrina, with live footage showcasing the flooding, fires, and looting in New Orleans.  Several callers shared their experiences, including one whose home was flooded and another referencing Elliot in the Morning’s commentary. A caller explained flood insurance processes.

A subsequent segment heavily focused on the Hurricane Katrina devastation in New Orleans, highlighting the widespread flooding, power outages (potentially lasting six weeks), and displacement of thousands.  A Coast Guard Captain involved in rescue efforts was mentioned.  A caller, George from Colorado, recounted a dubious story about a friend losing electronic stores via internet-connected security cameras, leading to a skeptical and profane response from the hosts.  Bill Burr, promoting his upcoming performances at Caroline's Comedy Club, was a guest in the studio. A lengthy, profane Toyota commercial followed.  The show then veered into a nonsensical, sexually suggestive, and offensive joke about "Wang Chong." A caller, Ted, detailed the flooding in Jefferson Parish due to failed non-automated pumping stations resulting from evacuated personnel. The hosts received a bizarre gift – a heavy-duty corded drill – which sparked a prolonged, profane, and sarcastic exchange with a listener.  News reports of the hurricane’s damage were interspersed with the banter. The hosts angrily complained about XM Satellite Radio's omission of their show from a promotional catalog.  Another caller, Reg, engaged in a vulgar argument with Opie about the drill. A musical piece dedicated to Jim Norton and listener-submitted radio show clips ("Golden Ticket" segment) were played, along with audio clips from radio shows vying for a spot on XM Satellite Radio. The segment included politically charged remarks about the president's response to the crisis and concluded with a caller from New Orleans describing the ongoing crisis.

The final segment began with a caller, Tom, describing the aftermath of flooding in his area, including resorting to defecating in his backyard amidst dog feces due to lack of running water.  The hosts jokingly suggested looting for supplies (specifically beer).  Tom mentioned having whiskey but limited ice.  The discussion then shifted back to the news coverage of Hurricane Katrina and the Superdome’s unsanitary conditions and potential for unrest.  Several listeners played a "What Did I Learn" game, sharing their often crude and humorous takeaways from the show. Bill Burr made a brief appearance, promoting his Caroline's shows. The show concluded with a soundbite of what was implied to be Tom Sizemore's orgasm, followed by Bill Burr apologizing for a previous controversial statement he made on the show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Thank you. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  You're a fine bunch of bullies, aren't you?  I'm Opie.  I can give a fuck.  I'm Jim Norton and I'm on the radio.  Shut up.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's all about fun, fun, fun.  I'd love to spit in your face.  I will fucking kill you.  Shut up, stupid.  I'm just a zilcher.  I know it.  Who cares?  We're trying to do a fucking radio show.  I know what we're trying to do.  I'm sitting here across from you.  I understand that.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Despicable ass hat.  And these dummies that work for us.  You guys stink.  Ben looks like a tall baby. 
[00:04:00]  Always laughing in the wrong places.  Ben, where's the quality?  He rocks.  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  And there's Steve.  Steve is a piece of garbage.  And you stink.  You are courtly invited to a robbery rape.  This is family entertainment.  This show is a disaster.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  If you have any poo, sing it now.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  What has happened here was caused by a force which, up until a few days ago, was entirely 
[00:04:30]  beyond the scope of man's imagination.  An unknown which at this very moment still prevails and could at any time lash out with  its terrible destruction anywhere else in the world.  There were once many people here who could have told of what they saw.  Now there are only a few.  Emergency hospitals were overflowing with the maimed and the dead.  For the living, the horror of last night was over.  The only thought left was the paralyzing fear that it could happen again today or tomorrow. 
[00:05:00]  For some of the victims, there was hope.  For others, there would be no tomorrow.  Hey, what's up, man?  Hi.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show on XM Satellite Radio.  Thanks for joining us today.  We greatly appreciate it.  Greatly, greatly appreciate it as we attempt to make the biggest comeback in radio history. 
[00:05:30]  In radio history.  Getting more gooder every day.  More listeners coming aboard every single day.  Not many shows can say that.  Kind of blows.  We've been working our asses off for almost a year.  I check the email every day.  Hey guys, I just found you last week.  You guys are kind of funny.  How long have you been on XM?  I just heard you a couple of days ago. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, really?  Thanks.  I've been here for a year hammering away.  Day in and day out.  Or day out and day in.  I like saying day in and day out.  Yeah, I think that's the way to go.  Go in, then you come out.  So what are they saying?  What are they saying on the front page of your paper today?  Why don't you give us a call?  Daily News.  Big, big letters.  Killer.  Killer.  Katrina slams Gulf Coast with 145 mile per hour fury. 
[00:06:30]  55 dead.  50 and 1 Mississippi apartment complex.  Anthony, what is that about?  Apartment complex.  A building collapsed.  Trapped a bunch of people.  Killed them.  Shouldn't those people have left?  Well, obviously, yes.  Those people should have left.  Were they in a dangerous area?  Yes, they were.  Right on the coast there in Mississippi.  But if you watched the news, you might not have known that that was a dangerous area  because they were so busy hyping the cereal bowl-like New Orleans that... 
[00:07:00]  I like to say Nolins.  Nolins?  Nolins.  Nolins.  N-A-W-L-I-N-S.  If you want to play at home.  Nolins.  They were so busy hyping that and the levees.  And showing us cross-sections and how the whole city is going to be flooded.  That they really didn't get the word out about the surrounding areas as well as they could have, I think.  They had the mayor of New Orleans on there.  They had the governor, senators from the state, all talking about New Orleans. 
[00:07:30]  And they evacuated New Orleans.  But the surrounding areas, they didn't mention them much.  And that's where you're going to find most of your dead people floating around in Mississippi.  Mississippi!  Well, just before I left for the show today, I was watching one of the news channels.  They're all the same, so I don't even know which one it was.  And they said that bodies are floating down the streets of New Orleans.  Really?  Of New Orleans. 
[00:08:00]  A tree right through her head.  Nah, it's obviously a pretty serious weather event.  Of course.  No one ever said it wasn't going to be a big, serious weather event.  But they really hyped the hell out of that New Orleans thing, talking about how New Orleans wouldn't be the same, wouldn't be recognizable.  There'd be thousands upon thousands of dead in New Orleans.  And New Orleans got off pretty easy as far as the dead go, so far anyway.  It's flooding, though. 
[00:08:30]  They're showing the floods coming in.  Not as quickly as they thought, but now some of those levee breaches or water's coming in, and the water's rising even now.  Well, you know what the bit would be?  To get all the audio of Fox and CNN and MSNBC and the Weather Channel, and all the stuff they said was definitely going to happen.  Yeah.  They weren't even saying, well, this could happen.  They're like, no, this is exactly what's going to happen.  It's going to be catastrophic.  Thousands of people are going to lose their lives.  One guy was saying that it's like our version of a tsunami. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  New Orleans, as you know it, will cease to exist.  Remember all that stuff two days ago?  Of course I do.  And now, I mean, like we keep saying here, it's serious, but it's nowhere near what they said it would be.  What they said.  A lot of flooded houses, though.  They're showing people now, now that the sun is coming up, they're showing people on the roofs of their houses.  There are people that had to go into their attics with axes and chop through the roof so they can get out on top of the roof. 
[00:09:30]  And they're waiting for help to come in.  And then, of course, there's the Superdome.  There are the people that took refuge in the Superdome.  And that, the conditions inside the Superdome are deteriorating.  They're saying that two people in there have died.  And they're, they said the smell in there is unlike anything you can imagine.  They can't let people out to get fresh air yet.  And it's really building up quite a stench. 
[00:10:00]  It's disgusting, unsanitary conditions in there.  And they're having quite a problem in there in the Superdome.  The roof, a big section of the covering of the roof came off.  A lot of holes in there.  I thought there were only a couple of small holes.  They showed some pretty big holes in the roof of the Superdome.  And water must have been pouring in there.  And somebody that took shelter was quoted as saying, I could have stayed home for this.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  No, you couldn't.  No, your house would have been gone.  Your house is underwater.  Your house is gone, sir. 
[00:10:30]  Well, we have a Superdome song by Dave.  We should get right to it today.  Dave?  Who's Dave?  This guy Dave, a faithful listener of the program, sent this little ditty in about the Superdome.  Righty?  And riding out the storm with everybody else at the Superdome.  I was born and raised in New Orleans, but hurricanes are coming.  I'm seeking shelter in the Superdome.  Me and 10,000 black folks call it home.  Gators, snakes, and fire ants, the towns will live in hell.  Shitpipes filling up our homes.  Still smells better than the folks in the Superdome. 
[00:11:00]  Ain't nothing super about it.  Does anybody here speak English?  Next time I'll look for shelter in a jail.  Now I'm fighting for my life with Tyrell.  Oh, Tyrell, oh, Tyrell.  Please release me from this hell.  But my city burned my home.  Take me from this place called the Superdome.  Guests choked me with those big hands in the Superdome.  That's right.  There you have it.  A little ditty about the Superdome.  That's pleasant.  Jeez. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, it's an awful situation there.  Too soon?  Well, it's a little ditty there.  It's no tsunami, son.  Let's all relax.  New York Post.  Front page of the New York Post.  Dad Pitt.  Oh, wait a minute.  Yeah.  Exclusive story and photos of Brad Pitt.  Yeah, the Post.  They can't even, like, wait a day.  Like, they have the front page.  They don't need to go with the Brad Pitt, you know.  Angelina Jolie.  Angle.  But, of course, they couldn't help themselves. 
[00:12:00]  Put it on page two?  The front page of the New York Post.  Dad Pitt.  And, basically, they got a picture of Brad with a baby bottle in his back pocket.  So, they're kind of making you think that, wait, what's going on here?  What the hell is he doing?  He's being a father to Angelina Jolie's adopted children there.  That's all that's about.  That guy should just be fucking.  He should just be out fucking.  That's it.  Baby bottle in his pocket.  Sucking and squeezing.  Yeah, you're kind of right about that. 
[00:12:30]  Did you see the woman from Africa that came forward?  Girl.  What am I saying?  Woman.  Came forward and said she was the mother of Angelina Jolie's newly adopted black baby.  I saw that over the weekend.  From a rape.  Yeah.  She was raped and had this baby.  And that's what Angelina Jolie has at home now.  Very nice.  And Brad Pitt's playing daddy.  Isn't that cute?  Well, he always wanted to be a father, so.  There you have it.  But was that front page worthy after what happened yesterday?  Well, that's the post for you.  You know, the Daily News, they, you know, they laid low as far as that stuff goes today. 
[00:13:00]  But the New York Post, then they do have a headline that says 69 dead.  Dead.  Katrina's killer rampage.  How the fuck do you put Dad Pitt over 70 dead people?  How do you do that and call yourself a news organization?  Jimmy.  It's Brad Pitt.  It's Brad Pitt.  That's a good point.  Stop.  And Brad does rhyme with dad.  Holy shit.  And they purposely used the number 69. 
[00:13:30]  Why?  Of course they did.  Why?  Because you could just round it off.  No one's going to, like, call you on it.  You think that's an attention getter?  All the false reporting in the paper on a daily basis, they could have easily just said 70 dead.  Who's counting officially?  You think it's some kind of subliminal sexual thing?  Of course it is.  You see Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie and then 69.  I went to college.  I know all about this stuff.  And picture them 69.  It's time for me to show my knowledge.  Yes. 
[00:14:00]  Wow, that is a leap.  I swear to God, man, we could do a whole show on this.  You're walking by the newsstand.  You see 69 subliminal, subliminal, you pick up the paper.  Like, what's that about?  And in this case, it's 69 dead.  And, you know, if, if, I don't know.  If you had a car and you're dead today, eh, what's wrong with you?  You tell those dead people.  I hope the 69 people that died, very tragic, obviously, but I hope they weren't car owners. 
[00:14:30]  No, I think they're very impoverished people.  Because if you had a car and you have cable TV, hello, what are you waiting for?  There was pretty much no excuse if you knew what was happening.  Like, I see all these cars that are, like, up to their rooftops.  I'm like, why weren't they used?  Why weren't they used to drive the fuck out of there?  Exactly.  Leave.  Leave.  Go 100 miles, you know, down a country road, something.  Good pert.  Find higher ground for your car. 
[00:15:00]  Or maybe these are the people that just were really, really hungover and just didn't feel like moving their cars.  Yeah, it could be, too.  You did make a really good point just before you went on the air, Anthony.  I mean, you know, the media has changed, you know, with 24-hour news and satellite TV and cable TV, up-to-the-minute updates, even though they're just telling fairy tales, basically.  Yeah.  Speculation.  But there was a time that, you know, you didn't have this.  You just didn't know.  I mean, back in ye olden days, you would just be there at the beach, maybe. 
[00:15:30]  You have your house on the beach, you're in New Orleans, wherever it was, and you'd be like, oh, it's raining.  It's raining pretty good.  Oh, this storm, it sure is getting dark.  And then before you know it, you and everyone else that lived there was just swept into the sea, you know?  How odd would that be?  You just, and you wouldn't know if it was a rainstorm or one of these hurricanes that Grandpappy would tell you about. 
[00:16:00]  You just, they had no clue when these things were rolling in.  Now you get all this advance notice, there's no reason that anybody should have been left at the beach sitting there waiting for a big wave to come in or a storm surge to drown you.  Right.  I guess that apartment building collapsing, they probably thought they were safe in there.  But it was, I heard that was right on the water also.  I mean, what the hell is it?  Pretty big apartment complex.  One whole part of it collapsed, and that's where most of your dead people were so far. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  I would probably feel safe in an apartment building, like any type of concrete structure that's like that.  Not right on the water like that.  Especially, you know, that was in a part of the state that really got slammed, you know, with the maximum winds.  But, I don't know, just leave.  Like, yeah, I love these defiant people.  I'm not leaving.  Remember that guy on Mount St. Helens?  Remember that old codger who sat there and was like, I'm not leaving.  And the press was all over this guy because Mount St. Helens built up for quite a while. 
[00:17:00]  And they made a celebrity out of this guy.  How defiant and the courage he had.  And he's, well, look at this old codger.  He's staying barbecued.  Barbecued to a crispy ash consistency and then blown away.  You can't play chicken with nature.  Get the fuck out, stupid.  People think it's something like, well, look at me.  I'm going to stand up. 
[00:17:30]  I'm an individual.  I'm not going with the masses.  And I'm staying with my house.  All right.  Bye-bye, bloated body floating past you in a canal.  Yeah, way to have respect for the mountain.  Yeah.  It's ready to blow, but you'll show it.  Yeah, I'm going to show you.  Fucking dope.  Yeah, you're going to be nature.  You're going to be the guy.  Unbelievable.  You're going to be the guy that beats nature.  Let's say hi to Chris in Jersey.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, little Jimmy.  Morning.  Last night, Fox News did a bit with the weather forecasters that weren't so fortunate. 
[00:18:00]  They had a guy clinging to a mailbox with 90-mile-an-hour wind.  The mailbox is peeling away.  Finally, he's like, guys, I've got to get to a safer area.  And the next one was a guy in about four feet of water,  hanging from a cable, just getting blown away.  And then Fox News reporters come back.  They're like, oh, well, there's some not-so-fortunate weather forecasters.  The mailbox guy was hysterical. 
[00:18:30]  He blew down the sidewalk into the mailbox, and he goes to grab onto it to steady himself.  And a piece of the mailbox rips off in his hand.  He lets go of it, and it goes flying down the street.  So now he's going to seek shelter where the camera guy is.  The camera guy is in some kind of an open portion of a warehouse-looking thing.  Was it a reporter or just a...  It was a reporter.  And the cameraman was out of the wind, but close enough where he could film the guy.  So the guy now gets up and tries to make his way into the warehouse. 
[00:19:00]  A gust of wind blows him flat on his ass and blew him about five feet into the warehouse,  where the camera guy had a perfect view of his face.  His face was scared shitless.  Hysterical.  Another great clip last night from, I think it was CNN or Fox.  Who knows, like Ope said.  Same thing.  Was the anchor saying,  let's look down Bourbon Street right now and just listen to this wind.  So it's a whole let's be quiet thing. 
[00:19:30]  The camera's showing the scene.  You hear the wind blowing,  and you hear the cameraman clear as a bell right behind the camera.  I guess they didn't know he was on.  He just goes,  fucking A.  There were plenty of those great moments last night on the news.  That's great.  Dr. D. in Kentucky, what's up?  Good morning, everybody.  The newspaper here in Kentucky,  the top issue is actually not the hurricane.  The governor of Kentucky is issuing some pardons. 
[00:20:00]  I pardon you to some people who have been on the wrong side of the law in his administration.  But the main issue,  the headline reads,  Killer Katrina roars ashore.  And they have this big picture of a street that's flooded.  About 40 people.  And they all have one thing in common.  They don't have any white people on there.  It looks like a bowl of cocoa puffs. 
[00:20:30]  But one thing before I go,  go easy on your call screener today.  I think he messed up when he was trying to patch me through,  and I was listening in on him,  and I think he's having a bad day so far.  Oh, you were able to listen to him screening the rest of the calls?  Well, no, he was complaining about something.  I don't know what it was,  but I think he's not having a good day,  so, you know, kind of go easy on him and whatever.  All right.  Thank you, Dr. D.  Thank you.  Later.  Bye.  Anything, Danny?  What happened?  Did you seriously want to know what I was complaining about? 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, go ahead.  I'd love to know.  I have a recorder in there,  and we're trying to gather some random gassers  for the next round of the fart game,  and Nathaniel wasted one by not recording it,  and that's what I was upset about.  Oh.  I do apologize to whoever's name was.  That's a valid reason.  Valid reason to be upset.  A Miss Gasser is acceptable, son.  I hope you feel better.  I love it.  New York Newsday, Killer Katrina.  Yeah.  Jim is saying,  what's taking Delgado so long? 
[00:21:30]  The clock is ticking.  Right.  I bet they're making jokes about Rick writing a song  about this whole thing.  I want to know what the front page of your paper says today.  Give us a call, okay?  I am really hard to agree.  The Kentucky guy had nothing.  This is awful.  This New York Post is revolting.  Yeah.  How bad that is.  Brad Pitt.  Is an entertainment story about Brad Pitt really...  It's very disrespectful.  If Brad Pitt was killed or something,  and they said Brad Pitt killed...  All right.  But Dad Pitt?  And the sad part is... 
[00:22:00]  What fucking editor approves that?  The sad part is there's no story there,  but once again,  they're trying to get you to buy the paper,  so they figure Dad Pitt,  oh my God,  did he knock up Anjali Jolie?  If you don't care.  It turns out,  no,  he's just got a baby bottle in his back pocket,  and he's helping her out  as she raises these two adopted kids.  And you wonder why the scumbags in the media  are attacked by this show constantly.  That's up there with 69 dead people.  There's a photo of Brad Pitt on page seven 
[00:22:30]  with a baby bottle sticking out of his back pocket,  and that's what the whole thing is about.  Yeah.  But put it on the front page.  Holy shit.  That could have been page six.  You know,  crap,  drivel,  the rest of the drivel.  Dad Pitt.  That editor,  I don't know who you are,  I hope you're paralyzed in a car accident.  I really do.  I hope you're paralyzed from the neck down.  New York Post,  Linda Stacey's column.  One of the many people  I can't wait to spit on someday  when I see them live. 
[00:23:00]  She really is awful.  No,  I mean,  the shit she said about my family  when we went through our thing,  I can't wait to see it face to face.  She was one of many.  I kept the list,  trust me.  Nice.  Linda Stacey writes in the Post today,  Am I crazy,  or was it tough to believe  all those studio-bound TV anchors  who begged the handsome hurricane hunks  to be careful out there?  She does make a good point about that.  You know,  you got these weather hunks,  she's calling them.  Weather hunks.  Out there,  just trying to get themselves  into some kind of dangerous situation. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  And of course,  the anchor people have to say,  hey,  make sure you're careful out there.  Keep safe.  We're not going to put any of our people  in harm's way.  Right.  The second the winds really kick up,  they are going to seek shelter  and get away from the water.  And meanwhile,  there was one guy on a dock.  He was actually on a dock  sticking out into the water.  Other people in the wind where,  and this woman mentioned something,  that clip they keep showing,  I guess on CNN, 
[00:24:00]  where the guy almost gets hit  by a flying piece of rooftop.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And he goes,  whoa, whoa,  I'm getting out of here.  But then they always have to sound like  they're concerned for that person.  And please seek shelter.  They're not concerned.  Believe me,  if we had our own news program  and we sent Eric to stand out there,  I'd be fucking rooting for something  to fly by and smash him in the mouth.  A big fence post  just right through his stomach.  Of course.  Of course.  Because that...  The old mayonnaise pouring out of his mouth.  Of course.  Because in the end, 
[00:24:30]  that will get the ratings up  if one of these weatherhomes  bidded on live TV.  Did you see the old guy  drive into the water?  No.  I've been showing that clip.  This old guy is driving his car  and out of nowhere,  you just see him drive into this lake  that formed in the road.  Yeah.  And a reporter goes running out to his car  and starts actually pulling his floating car  back to where the road was.  But this car was floating.  And the best part of it was  the car comes out of nowhere, 
[00:25:00]  hits the water,  and you see it bob forward  and start floating.  and you see the brake lights come on.  The guy drove right in the water.  But until it starts floating,  he didn't even step on the brake.  But then it's like,  oh,  I put down my flippers.  Did they get him out?  He was just sitting there  with the window down  talking to the reporter  as the reporter was  kind of pulling the car  back to shore.  Oh, that's classic.  And he said,  he goes,  he was like, 
[00:25:30]  the road blended right into the water.  I just drove right into it.  Old people  and cars.  When his brake lights came on,  I just started cracking on.  Why do it now, idiot?  Well,  the weather people,  they were a little intense yesterday.  Yes.  You watch as we move forward  with this hurricane coverage  because this is becoming  like the latest thing.  The car chase thing  just exploded.  You watch the next hurricane 
[00:26:00]  that comes through.  These guys are going to come up  with ways to show  their weather hunks  in very dangerous situations.  Yep.  They've got to.  They've got to.  That's why.  They're going to tie them to rope  so they can be hanging sideways.  You watch.  You watch the stuff  they come up with  just to beat out each other  for ratings.  When you're switching  back and forth  from CNN to Fox,  what makes you stop?  Is it some guy  talking about,  you know,  how New Orleans  is a bull?  Is it that guy?  Are you stopping  to watch him again? 
[00:26:30]  Or are you stopping  to watch the guy  that might get hit  with something  at any minute?  You're going to watch  the guy in danger.  Of course.  So they have to  top each other  in order to get  these viewers.  I love it.  I was addicted.  Of course.  I bashed the media  and the press  and everything  on a daily basis  but I sit like a zombie  in front of the TV  with the remote  in my hand  just going back and forth  going,  I cannot believe  these morons  are doing this.  But I've got to tell you,  you understand 
[00:27:00]  the end game  with this whole thing.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't watch CNN  or Fox News Channel  or any of these  news outlets anymore  for real news.  I just don't.  It's a big  Hollywood production  like we were  kind of talking  about yesterday.  Yeah.  But actually  giving real news  about this thing,  no way are they  doing that.  We were sitting  around the house  yesterday just  yelling at the TV  like one of the  anchors would say  something ridiculous  and I'd hear my  girlfriend from the  kitchen go,  oh, shut up!  And I'm watching 
[00:27:30]  and I'll be like,  oh, you idiot,  get out of...  And we're just  yelling at the TV  laughing that  these people are  just morons.  Yeah, Jimmy?  Just thinking of you  just both screaming  at the television  in this perfectly  sealed house  where no germs are.  I had this really  weird vision.  It's true.  No germs  and plenty of moths.  Oh, you still have them?  Oh, I got moths.  Oh, and then  I'm trying to watch TV.  I'm trying to watch TV 
[00:28:00]  last night in the bedroom  and a moth  lands on the screen  and it won't leave.  So, and of course,  I'm too lazy to get up  so I'm laying in bed  about nine feet away  from the TV going  laughing like old  tuberculosis lungs.  It's got no effect.  Blow out the birthday  candle.  What happened?  Did the FBI person  come to ask about  Mrs. Lippman  and some of her people?  Wait a minute,  wait a minute,  wait a minute. 
[00:28:30]  I got a card.  Yeah.  Damn moths.  I got moths.  And you have,  I have a little,  I have these little,  I actually had a lady  come by yesterday.  I went to Craigslist  for the first time  legitimately  because I thought  my plants were infected  like little bit bugs.  I had these little  teeny black bugs  by this window.  I think that they  just were born  by the window  and a lady,  I thought it was  Stalker Patty.  Really?  Exactly like  Stalker Patty.  She came over your house  to look at my plants?  From Craigslist.  Yeah.  You had a woman  come over your house 
[00:29:00]  and you didn't have  sex with that.  I gave her 30 bucks  just for coming over  and, you know,  look at my plants  like an hour's wage,  20 bucks an hour she has.  You had someone,  you paid a woman  to come over  and look at the bugs  on your plant.  No, there weren't  no bugs in my plants.  I've seen a couple  by the window.  I thought they might  have come from the soil  so I wanted to make sure  my plants weren't infected  with insects.  How many plants  do you have?  Two.  Two like trees.  Two trees in your plant.  Very expensive  indoor trees.  Well, they're just  looking at you  getting a hundred bucks  or eighty bucks.  You are so fancy. 
[00:29:30]  Well, yeah.  So, Ant's got the moths.  What's the diagnosis?  I'm so curious now.  Oh, the plants  she said are healthy.  I was really so happy.  So what were the bugs about?  I'm going to have  an exterminator.  There's only a few of them.  I've seen them  when I used to live  with my parents.  They're like little  teeny, teeny black bugs.  Yeah.  I don't know if they fly  or whatever  but I think that they  just came in through  the window and hatched  little fellas.  Oh, all right.  We all have our crosses  to bear.  But you have moths.  I have moths.  I have those little things.  You have little black  teeny bugs.  Little teeny ones.  All right, well,  I guess I got a confession.  Well, you had mice. 
[00:30:00]  Well, the mice are  under control.  Thank God.  Because they're gross.  I ended up killing  six of them in a week.  That electric trap  that one of the  faithful listeners sent  worked beautifully.  Yeah.  I got three in that alone.  And since being back  from vacation  a good three or four days,  no more mice.  No more mice.  That's great, dude.  No more mice.  So you're critter-free  in your apartment.  Well, now I need  some advice on  the latest problem 
[00:30:30]  with my apartment.  Yeah.  And I want to make  it perfectly clear.  It's a nice place.  I have a cleaning lady  that comes, you know,  so it's not a pigsty.  It's not.  I now have  cockroaches.  I have killed  three cockroaches  in the last two days.  They are by far  the most disgusting,  putrid, filthy bug  you could have.  Cockroaches just  creep me the fuck out.  They look,  they look human,  they have, 
[00:31:00]  they have,  like,  human behavior.  Yeah.  Scurrying with  that nasty body.  Well, I'm sure  if you've seen  three of them,  I'm sure there's no more.  Oh, no.  Maybe you just hang out,  three of them will go somewhere.  What's the formula,  they say?  If you see one,  you have hundreds.  A billion.  Yeah.  I think what the formula is,  I've heard about that.  So I've killed three  in the last couple of days,  now I'm wondering  if the mice  were keeping  the cockroaches  out of the apartment  and now that  the mice are pretty much 
[00:31:30]  nowhere to be found.  You screwed up  the delicate ecosystem  of your apartment.  You know what happens  if you get rid of  the predators  on the Serengeti,  Opie?  You'll have  antelope  and all those things  running around  and then they'll eat  all the grass  and there won't be  any grass  for any of the other.  You screwed up  the entire chain  of life,  the circle of life.  Do mice eat cockroaches  first of all?  I would think  probably they do.  I would think  mice probably  eat cockroaches  and I think 
[00:32:00]  as Jimmy was saying,  cockroaches can  probably sense  that there are  mice in the house  and stay away  from the predator.  Sure,  they probably stay away  and they were  somewhere else  and now they're like,  alright,  Dumbbell got rid  of the mice,  let's go boys.  That's it,  move in boys.  Oh man.  Wow,  where did you find them?  Three different rooms,  that's the problem.  Kitchen,  living room,  bathroom.  Have you ever seen  a living roach nest?  I've seen it.  Alright,  stop.  Listen to me,  my friend's mother, 
[00:32:30]  my friend Kenny,  we grew up,  his mother,  have you ever seen  Pacific Heights  Michael Keaton?  No.  Well,  he rents a house  and what he does,  he purposefully  infests it with roaches  and then the landlord  attacks him  and he sues the landlord.  It's a really weird scam  that there are people  that do it.  My friend's mother  owned a house  in New Brunswick  and rented it  to this psychotic  Hungarian woman  and her adult son.  They let it get  infested with roaches.  Of course they did.  If you really do  want to murder them.  Stop.  And I went there  two days after  they had finally  been evicted.  It's so hard  to get people out.  There were, 
[00:33:00]  it was like,  we looked behind  the stove.  Oh my God.  I'm not kidding you.  I'm freaking out already.  It looked like,  I guess it was  a quarter the size  of a basketball  and it was a black lump  and I looked closer  and it was moving.  It was a living mass  cockroach nest.  They had,  this is after  they had already bombed.  God damn.  It was spoiled meat  on the floor.  I mean this was like  beyond where you are  obviously but I've never,  you open drawers  and they just,  it was so many roaches.  Yeah,  I just got an itch.  So many roaches. 
[00:33:30]  I'll never forget  as long as I lived.  So many roaches  that they would just,  it was moving  in the drawer.  They couldn't hide fast enough.  There were too many  of them to hide fast enough.  There were pregnant ones  inside the cabinet.  I mean they're awful.  They live in these  like weird living nests.  So there is somewhere  behind your walls  a living lump  of roaches.  That's the way they live.  Nice.  I'll be out of there soon.  James.  Great hard description  that was to me.  James in Tennessee.  James,  were you the one  that sent me  the electric mousetraps? 
[00:34:00]  Yes,  I was.  Dude,  you rock,  man.  Didn't it work good?  It's unbelievable  and I've had that trap,  two of them set  for the last four days  and I haven't caught anything.  Get out of here.  Jimmy Norton  was sitting there  going like,  do you live  in a nuclear factory  or something?  Why?  Jim Norton.  Yes,  sir.  You never talk to me.  Every time I call it  and you never talk.  I'm sorry,  I'm just,  you're talking to Ops,  so I didn't want to be,  you know,  Ira interrupt.  Well,  I'm going to tell you  about the roaches  and there's the grossest, 
[00:34:30]  nastiest thing  in the world.  They really are.  We got this white powder  and all it takes,  you put a little bit  out behind your refrigerator.  More than likely  you find them  in the kitchen.  What's it do to them?  Do what?  No,  wait,  what does the white powder do?  this guy's a wreck.  I'm sure it takes it  back to their nest.  Their moving ball nest. 
[00:35:00]  Let's say hi to Bill  in Delaware.  Bill,  let's go.  Hey,  how you doing guys?  All right.  One of the things  you can do for roaches  works really well,  get some of that  combat gel bait.  Yeah.  You put it up  in the corners  of like cabinets,  you know,  right along the lines  of all your cabinets  in your kitchen  and your bathroom  on the inside.  It'll work for you.  When I used to live  in Brooklyn  in an apartment,  they had an exterminator  come in through  the whole building  once every couple of months  and he would squeeze  some kind of shit  out of this toothpaste  tube looking thing  and put it in your cabinets  under the sink 
[00:35:30]  and a couple of the other places,  nooks and crannies,  if you will.  And,  we still had cockroaches  now that I think about it.  Did you really?  I do it for a living.  Anytime you live  in an apartment,  a lot of the times  you live in an apartment building,  you're going to see cockroaches  no matter what  because they have people  next door to you.  It's just,  it's conducive to cockroaches.  You have garbage chutes,  you have places  on different floors  where,  like there was a room  where the garbage chute was.  You'd go out 
[00:36:00]  into the hallway,  take your bag of garbage  and throw it down  the garbage chute.  There were these  animal savages  that would leave  the garbage bags  piled up in the room  where the garbage chute was  instead of throwing it  down the chute.  Their garbage bags  would be so big  it wouldn't fit down the chute  so they would leave  pizza boxes  and garbage  in that room  and cockroaches,  I mean,  please,  they're living  high on the hog  like it's the  cockroach Hilton  over there.  Well,  you know what it is?  It's like,  it's nice to have  these opportunities 
[00:36:30]  to at least ask people  for help here  on the Pedro and Anthony show.  I think it's really nice.  He says,  you're a millionaire  would you get out  of that dump?  Opie loves the address.  You love the address.  No,  no,  I'm not.  You love living up there.  Not necessarily.  I'm ready to look  and I'll be looking  all over Manhattan.  It's a nice apartment.  It's an expensive apartment.  It's not like you live  on a dive.  It's a great place.  It's just that  my friend Greg  is a comedian  who does like this  through a construction show  and he knows  how to plug up apartments 
[00:37:00]  but these are like places  that have these holes  that they come in  and there's just  nothing you can do.  Nothing.  Especially on the ground floor  in the city.  Right.  I mean,  they're in reality.  They're coming under the door.  Yeah,  I mean,  it really is an open invitation  to invest.  So what,  should I,  I know,  should I try the combat gel?  Yeah,  I think,  you know,  give that a shot first,  you know,  and then,  you know,  you might need someone  to come in  and do it for you,  but.  All right.  I think one of the listeners  is going to help me  exterminate the place there.  All right.  Thanks, sir.  Yep.  Let's go back to the hurricane, 
[00:37:30]  Hurricane Katrina.  Big news today.  Pete on Long Island,  what's up?  How's it going, guys?  Hey.  Yeah,  I'm watching MSNBC yesterday  and this idiot's on a man lift  demonstrating how high  the floodwaters could get.  On a lift?  On a lift.  Yeah.  He's like,  he goes up 20 feet.  Well,  if the floodwaters go this high,  then this is how high they'll be.  And I mean,  I was just praying  for that guy to fall off that lift.  Yeah,  they're pretty much  running out of ideas.  And they had an operator  on the bottom.  All right,  take me down now.  No,  keep going.  Keep going.  No,  no,  no,  take me back up now. 
[00:38:00]  And this guy,  you could just tell  he wanted to send him  right through the roof.  Jigsaw from Reno,  Nevada,  St. Reno's front page.  First day jitters.  Sixth graders face fears  of starting middle school.  And then a little article  on the side  about the Hurricane Katrina.  Right.  Well,  this is how  Nolens is reporting it.  in their newspaper.  Catastrophic.  Big letters.  Storm surge swamps  Ninth Ward,  St. Bernard. 
[00:38:30]  Lakeview levee breach  threatens to inundate the city.  After the mighty storm  came the rising water.  Flooding wipes out  two communities.  That's how Nolens  is reporting it today.  St. Louis.  Chaos,  calamity,  a long coast.  Calamity.  Calamity.  I don't see that word  used much.  Use crab apples  to rid roaches.  Here we go.  What year is this?  White powder 
[00:39:00]  is highly toxic.  God, dude.  White powder.  All right,  we'll go to this guy.  Eric,  what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  I was watching  the Weather Channel  yesterday.  Did you see that clip  where they showed  this oil drilling platform  that was in,  I guess,  like Mississippi Harbor  came loose from Anchorage  and drifted  and got caught  under this bridge?  Yeah,  nailed the bridge.  Wait,  what was that about,  Ant?  Yeah,  one of those big oil rigs  or oil platforms  shook loose  and it went down a river 
[00:39:30]  and smashed right into a bridge  and got jammed under it.  How do you clean up that mess?  What is it?  A big oil rig.  Oh, my God.  One of those offshore oil rigs.  Yeah,  they got their hands  full down there,  that's for sure.  Wow,  they're showing the Superdome now.  Our roof is not good.  Yeah,  the roof really peeled back  and bigger holes  than I thought.  Yeah,  the top is a mess.  And then the Hyatt,  did you see the hotel?  That whole side of it,  every window was blown out.  Every single one, 
[00:40:00]  the whole side of the hotel.  Well,  had people stayed in the hotel  or had they left?  A lot of people were in there.  Yep.  I probably,  again,  I would have felt safe  in the Hyatt.  You would think,  but that whole side  was just glass.  It's one of those hotels  that had complete windows  on the side like that.  I believe.  Here's the front page  of the Boston Herald,  Anthony.  They have a little thing.  Socks.  Is it a Red Sox story?  They have a tiny little headline  dedicated to the hurricane.  It says Katrina's wrath.  And then the big headline  is abandoned.  As frantic families 
[00:40:30]  search for him,  hospital let vet's corpse  lay in morgue  for two months.  That's their big story?  Yeah.  An old vet.  Sure,  there's a Yankee thing  they have in there somewhere.  Maybe Ed Figueroa  was busted for a DWI.  Those obsessed shitheads.  That they are.  And something kind of funny  happened on CNN yesterday.  CNN daybreak.  The weather geek there  lost it.  They are all a little frazzled 
[00:41:00]  from a lot of time  they've spent awake  with each other.  And they get on  each other's nerves.  You got to think.  And these meteorologists  always want to have  a little inside edge.  Something that the other  channel isn't getting.  So even when they're  not on screen  they're pawing through  all their data  trying to come up  with some kind of angle.  So they're probably awake  for this entire episode.  And this guy,  he got a little angry.  I think also  they're just a bunch 
[00:41:30]  of robots.  Yeah.  They're just used to  reading what the weather  is about.  And they read all  their instruments.  Yes.  But to the common man,  let's be honest,  when we watch the weather,  just tell us if it's  going to rain tomorrow.  Tell us what it is.  And if there's a hurricane  just stick to the face.  You have to talk about  this low pressure thing  and this and barometric  what?  Barometric pressure.  95% of America  doesn't know what that does.  Inches of mercury.  But they continue to tell us  that it's rising and falling  and doing this and that. 
[00:42:00]  And I guess this guy  in CNN was talking  about barometric pressure.  Yes, he was getting  into the millibars  and I guess he was  boring the anchor.  Yeah.  This guy,  I saw this clip.  This is what weathermen are.  They're horribly boring people.  Every party the weatherman  is ever at,  they probably talk to a girl  and they're like,  what do you do?  I do the local weather.  Oh.  Oh, really?  A minute later,  she's probably going,  I'm going to go get a drink.  I'll be right back.  Yeah.  And once again,  he's alone with his fucking,  his ice tinkling alone 
[00:42:30]  and his glass.  You know,  because a lot of times  people don't understand  the satellite photos  and she's like,  oh, you fucking just  get tongue cancer already.  Absolutely right  because at first  you'd probably think  the girl would be like,  hey, he's on TV.  Oh.  He's on TV every night.  He's probably pulling in  a nice little paycheck.  And then when he just goes  on and on  about a frontal system  and low pressure,  do you know  the counterclockwise rotation  around a low?  Okay.  Yeah.  Okay.  Bye.  People with full drinks 
[00:43:00]  are going,  look,  I have to replenish this.  I'll be right back.  Oh,  is there a bathroom?  Really fast.  Cling, cling, cling, cling, cling, cling, cling.  This plastic party cup  with fucking  two pieces of half-melted ice.  He just keeps sucking them  and spitting them back in the cup.  She's not coming, shithead.  Andy in Jersey,  what's up?  Hey, Elb,  how's it going?  Hey, everybody.  Hey, sweet, Ted.  Hi, Ed.  Just a quick question,  I'll help you.  What does Indian date mean?  Do you mean inundate by any chance?  Yeah, I guess I do.  Did you say Indian date? 
[00:43:30]  He came awfully close.  Hmm.  Oh, well.  You go out on Indian date.  Well, I got,  I'm wearing a t-shirt today  that sums me up perfectly.  Yeah.  Would you like to read it  for everyone, Anthony?  It's a big picture of a,  looks like a potato  with legs and arms and a face.  Right.  And it's walking.  And above it,  it says,  you say potato.  And under it,  it says,  I say fuck you.  Oh.  I think that sums it up.  Whoever sent this shirt,  you nailed it.  You nailed it. 
[00:44:00]  This is what I'm all about.  I'm sorry for correcting you.  I just got a little scared.  I like the fact  it's just a potato  with two arms,  a mouth, eyes,  and feet with sneakers.  He's wearing sneakers.  The potato has no genitals  or asshole,  but it does have sneakers.  And little gloves on.  Yeah.  Very little gloves.  A little germaphobe.  It's a perfect shirt for me.  That's all I know.  All right.  Strut along,  a little potato.  So here's CNN daybreak yesterday,  a little fight between  the anchor chick. 
[00:44:30]  Is this video online?  Did Steve put it up?  I think so.  You've got to see the video, too.  The audio is great,  but the video  where this guy,  you could tell  he really gets angry  because when you hear him  raise his voice,  he takes the papers  that he's got in his hand  and throws them on the ground.  He's disgusted.  Oh, I didn't notice that.  Oh, yeah.  He is so disgusted.  I noticed her phony anchor smile  stayed on.  Okay.  And then at the end,  he tries to make it sound like  it was, you know,  he was kidding around,  but wow, was he pissed.  He was not kidding.  Oh, it's up on the line?  Very good. 
[00:45:00]  All right.  Here's the audio.  But the storm was 902 millibars.  902.  902 millibars.  Yeah, and this guy  had been going on about this  for some time already  when we come into this clip.  Raise your hand in your car right now  if you're still with this weather guy.  You understand what that means.  No one in the room  is raising their hand.  What the?  I just know it's very low pressure.  It's, uh...  Of course.  Why don't you explain millibars? 
[00:45:30]  It's the amount of actual atmosphere  that you have above you  in any given area.  A low pressure system  means that there is  less weight of the air,  actual air,  and it's measured in inches of mercury,  which would then push down  on this tube of mercury  and push it up the other side  and let you know  how much actual atmosphere is above you.  The less atmosphere above you, 
[00:46:00]  the worse the weather is going to be.  Low pressure.  Look around the studios.  I just counted five people  scratching their heads  during your explanation.  I've not made perfect sense.  I now know why you have no friends.  I don't.  I thought millibars  were bars where they serve millibier.  And how do you know this, Anthony?  I'm just watching the Weather Channel.  Forget Aristotle  and fuck Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony. 
[00:46:30]  Millibars.  Millibars, yes.  If one more person writes in  to tell me that that slurp  is a symbol,  I will shoot you  because it is a slurp  and I know it's a slurp  in the middle of that song.  There's a little symbol thing in there,  but I hear a slurp also.  Do you know when you're  a weatherman  and you resort to, say,  902 millibars,  you should then take out  a brown paper bag  and pull a Bud Dwyer.  You should just  shoot yourself on camera.  Yeah, there's no reason  for this guy to go into this.  But the storm was 
[00:47:00]  902 millibars.  902 was the lowest  that you had with this storm  a couple of hours ago.  So it has filled in a little bit,  filled in with some air,  not as low as pressure,  but Camille.  Let me talk, Carol.  Translate that for us.  Ah, Chad, Chad,  let me talk, Carol.  They're all uptight.  Oh, that's a great little snap.  Because no one else  pays attention to weathermen 
[00:47:30]  ever.  This is his moment.  This is his moment to shine.  You're absolutely right.  Every night,  this bitch is the center  of attention.  She's the one telling  the stories about the shootings,  the robberies, the rapes.  This guy has to go on  every night and go,  it's going to be sunny.  Wear your galoshes.  We're going to get rain.  Let's go to the five-day forecast.  Today was his day.  I see it a little differently, too.  I think she threw him  off his script.  Yeah.  And he just couldn't improvise.  It was like,  oh my God,  you're fucking me up,  don't you understand?  He thought he was  being interesting. 
[00:48:00]  Do you think?  He thought,  talking about the low pressure  and the barometer,  he thought he had  something rolling there  and he was going to be  interesting and everything.  And she found him  quite boring,  just like the women  at the party.  There he was.  Cutting him off.  Clink, clink.  Little Chad with a plastic cup  all over again  with the cameras rolling.  Carol,  I need another drink.  All right,  let's back up.  I'm trying to do this,  Carol.  Carol.  Slow pressure, 
[00:48:30]  Carol.  All right,  well,  let's back up slightly here.  Hours ago,  so it has filled in  a little bit,  filled in with some air,  not as low pressure.  but Camille,  but let me talk,  Carol.  Translate that for us.  I don't know what that means.  What does that mean?  Well,  if you would let me talk.  Mom!  I love you  and I have to do this now.  Mom!  Please stop calling.  It's impossible.  I'm just trying to tell you that.  What do you want?  You want tears to come out of my eyes?  Oh,  what a douche. 
[00:49:00]  The greatest is  this is what got him.  This is what this  emasculating anchor  did to this fucking schlub.  Chad!  Chad!  Oh,  yeah,  I know.  It was little,  little boy having his moment.  Right.  It wasn't,  Chad,  what does that mean?  It was,  you unimportant little bitch.  What are you trying to say?  You're boring us.  Chad had heard that exact same thing  from Mommy  for how many years?  Chad!  Chad! 
[00:49:30]  But Mom!  But no,  Mom!  I want to go over my friends.  I'm like,  Chad!  Chad!  That was her  shut the fuck up voice question.  That's exactly,  Chad!  It was a real scolding,  motherly thing.  Yeah,  and he just,  clenched the papers up.  It's about time,  though,  man,  because these guys talk  on a level  that no one can follow.  I hate her,  and I hate him equally.  I gotta hear her again.  All right,  here's him.  That is lower pressure,  but Camille,  let me talk here.  Translate that. 
[00:50:00]  What a cunt.  And she's no better.  Chad!  Chad!  Chad!  Chad!  Every horrible bore moment he had  just hit him in the face.  He suddenly realized  that all those girls weren't thirsty.  He just pictured himself,  and he just went through  every one in a millisecond  and realized, 
[00:50:30]  full glass,  full glass,  full glass.  Hey!  Hey,  wait a minute!  Hey,  we're bored.  Chad stinks.  Well,  there's more to it,  so why don't we back up here  and we'll let it roll a little.  Oh, yeah.  Filled in with some air,  not as low of pressure.  But Camille,  let me talk,  Carol.  Translate that for us.  I don't know what that means.  What does that mean?  Well,  if you would let me talk.  And that's where he threw his papers.  Camille.  That's where he threw his papers.  This video is up on  opandanthony.com,  by the way.  And I love the way  he keeps trying to talk through her. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  Like,  she's like,  Chad,  Chad,  Katrina,  and then he finally can't handle it.  What,  cunt,  what?  The best part is  he walks off camera.  Yeah.  And for a split second,  I'm thinking,  is he going to attack her?  Oh,  yeah,  just choke her out.  Why don't you do the weather,  Billy Boy?  Yeah.  Why don't you do it?  Oh,  you want to do that again?  I love these people  when they snap.  You got that clip?  That clock is good.  All right,  we'll play that clip.  Clock is good.  It is one of our faves.  All right,  here we go again.  We've got to keep backing up. 
[00:51:30]  I love it.  Air,  not as low of pressure,  but Camille.  Chad,  let me talk,  let me translate that for us.  I don't know what that means.  What does that mean?  Well,  if you would let me talk,  Camille,  Camille was 908.  And so this is actually,  now,  not as strong as Camille,  but not really as strong as it's been.  908,  I'm walking over here  because you're,  I can have this chart,  but it's not in front of me.  908 millibars is 26.81 inches of mercury. 
[00:52:00]  This storm got down to 26.61,  and right now it's 26.98.  Now,  if you would go to your home barometer that you have,  it's probably a big circle hanging on your wall  that you got from an uncle somewhere.  If you go look at that,  that is completely off the screen.  Rarely would you ever have to have a barometer  that would go that low in the Northern Hemisphere  unless you were obviously trying to get under a hurricane.  All right.  Thank you, Chad.  All right.  Just having fun with you this morning.  No, you're not.  It's a stressful time, I know. 
[00:52:30]  It's a stressful time, I know.  Okay, Boogie.  Just having some fun with you.  No,  you can't even be honest in your anger, Chad.  And neither was she actually laughing.  No.  The best part,  that was C and N.  Wow.  It wasn't just some, you know.  Local affiliate somewhere.  Right, in the middle of nowhere.  Nice.  That really wasn't.  Chad.  Here's the word.  Here's what it was called.  Jim.  Jim.  Anthony, just, just, just, just.  Anthony, just let me talk.  Call me Opie first, you idiot.  Just let me talk.  Did you hear him go Opie?  I am. 
[00:53:00]  Just let me talk.  Steve.  Steve.  Cut off.  Steve.  That's our thing today.  It's a C prompt.  Sometimes we can put C, semi-colon, slash,  then you sign back on.  That's exactly right, Jim.  Thank you so much for putting that out.  You're putting the accent on the wrong syllable.  That's exactly right.  Ramone.  You know what the worst?  The worst is,  this is what happened to this guy just there.  You're ever in the middle of a story,  and we all have,  and there's a deep down party  that knows you're an awful storyteller, 
[00:53:30]  and your story, it just blows.  What she said to him was,  Chad, this story sucks.  Right.  And he went, come on!  And then he was like,  oh my God,  this story really fucking is awful.  She heard the people switching to Fox.  He had to finish that,  that awful, uninteresting end.  If you had these,  and it would drop,  and your home barometer,  and he knew he had nothing.  26 inches of mercury,  as opposed to 24.3 inches of mercury.  Like, anyone is listening to that babble. 
[00:54:00]  He would have been justified in snapping,  if right after that he said,  look, when the barometer drops,  your teeth blow right off.  That would have been,  okay, he was going somewhere.  At least it had a good, strong ending.  Jesus, did he just peter out.  It's a stressful day.  Ah, Carol!  Oh, Carol, I hope you get cancer!  It's a stressful day.  We all just started.  I was just joking with you.  Yeah, it's just funny.  When I wish your uterus fell out.  That whole thing about the, you know,  the one side of the bra filled with paper,  I didn't mean it.  Wow. 
[00:54:30]  You weren't kidding, Chad.  You know, they had that awkward talk afterwards.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, trying to be all professional.  What was that about, Chad?  You know, groveling Chad.  Well, Carol, I was making a point.  This is my job, Carol.  This is what I do,  and it's a day that,  it's my day, Carol.  All right, Chad.  Oh, he just fell apart at the end,  because she pointed out,  and she hit him with the bell of clarity  that his story stunk. 
[00:55:00]  Right.  And he was pissed about it.  Oh, and it did.  Right on, Carol.  Good call.  Good call, Carol.  Because that fucker would have babbled for another hour.  He would have just yapped.  Barometer.  And you know when she was with her friends  or the co-workers later  and Chad wasn't around,  she was just like,  he was babbling on.  I thought he was going to go forever  if I didn't stop him.  He does this on sunny days,  and it was just,  I'd heard it enough.  I couldn't hear it.  I'd had enough today.  I could hear, like you said,  the dial's changing.  People changing over to Fox, 
[00:55:30]  and I wasn't going to allow him  to continue babbling like that.  And he continued with the millibar angle.  He still kept going, Carol.  All right, here we go.  Let's say hi to Jeff in New Orleans.  Jeff, what's up?  Yeah, my brother Mike  is inside the stadium there  in New Orleans.  Okay.  And I talked to him  about 30 minutes ago,  and he just said,  Baba Booey, Baba Booey.  Ah.  Baba Booey.  And I said, what?  And he goes, Baba Booey, Baba Booey.  And I said, huh?  And he goes on,  and he just said, 
[00:56:00]  Baba Booey, Baba Booey, Baba Booey, Baba Booey.  Baba Booey, Baba Booey.  And I said, really?  And he goes, Baba Booey, Baba Booey, Baba Booey.  wow  that was it  I pray that he was mocking  the whole Baba Booey thing  you gotta hope for his sake  that he was just goofing  because for anyone  in 2000  where are we? 2005?  2005  2005  Baba Booey, Baba Booey, Howard Stern's penis 
[00:56:30]  Baba Booey, Baba Booey, Baba Booey  tell him Fred  talk on and on about how you  invented radio  tell him Fred  alright well you got us  I don't know what to do now  quick dump out  don't let that go over the air  I know what I'm going to do  I'm going to pick up that debut album  by Stone Temple Pilots  oh I will say that last caller  was more interesting than Chad 
[00:57:00]  Chad  Baba Booey, Baba Booey, Chad  let me say Baba Booey, Carol  bag of douche  shut up  you could tell that guy  was getting more and more  uncomfortable as he continued  dude, you know what it is  when you do something  you got that hot flash  that hits you when you know  you're bombing  alright  we got Good Morning America  reactions from people  in the Superdome  oh  we're talking about the Superdome  which received a lot of damage 
[00:57:30]  it was considered a safe haven  but David Muir tells us  boy it was anything but safe  at one point  it was shortly after 7  the howling winds were peeling back parts of the roof  it began pouring inside  and for the 10,000 people sitting underneath the massive metal roof  it was an incredible and frightening sight  I was hoping that it wouldn't collapse  something like a tin can ripping open  by the can open or something  and we've seen a light from the top of the ceiling 
[00:58:00]  you can see the light from the outside coming in  and water was coming everywhere  it was raining just like it was rained outside  it definitely was frightening  at home when you hear that kind of noise  you can move and get out of the way  here the roof is so huge  so heavy  it's a hellhole  it's very miserable in here  and authorities hope to move the thousands here  to other shelters  but they have to find those shelters first  and admit that could take days 
[00:58:30]  for Good Morning America  David Muir, ABC News  New Orleans  the reality is it was a safe  yeah it was a safe place  safe haven for  those people would have been home  they probably would have been dead  of course  or on their rooftops  they should have allowed alcohol in there though  and pot  oh yeah  and pot  they did have a problem  as people were coming in  they confiscated some alcohol and guns  yeah  how bad do you think those bathrooms are?  ooh  they really don't have 
[00:59:00]  the ability to clean the place up  oh I will say  it's a stadium  so they're equipped  for 30,000 people  so I mean if you have 9 or 10,000  I mean they're there for a long time  but they are equipped  to handle 30,000 people  for a long time  do you think stadium people  are there  cleaning up  like they do  during their job  do you think the National Guard  National Guardsman  is going to go  why don't I go in there  and scrub the toilets  I think those fucking shitters  are just an abomination  it only takes one  to man  one 
[00:59:30]  one log  oh what  we've seen  we've seen it in bathrooms  that are supposed to be  cared for on a  daily basis  the one log  in the vault  that won't cooperate  that won't quite go down  wrecks it for everyone  it's just sitting there  with the toilet paper over it  I know  and you're trying to move the paper  so you can look off  look  look off  look off  oh yeah  oh quick  yeah  let me look off  I was going to say look  and  yeah  and you 
[01:00:00]  oh  oh  oh  let me finish  Carol  Carol  just know he kept  trying to barrel through  her castrating voice  and then he couldn't  he just couldn't  Chad  it was every girl  from high school  it was his mother  millibars  millibars  Chad  Mercury  and low pressure  clink  millibars  clink  clink  clink  with that stupid  pointy stick 
[01:00:30]  with a lime on it  and he knows  he can't go and refresh  his glass  because she'll be gone  when he gets back  of course  how many times  he's just sucked on ice  to keep her from walking away  it's a fucking  passive hostage taker  I gotta go to the bathroom  hurry back  I want to tell you about  the Doppler 4000  oh dude  he holds in shits  he holds in full bladders  and he sucks on ice  because if he walks away  she's talking to anyone 
[01:01:00]  else at that party  anyone else  very good  hey wait  don't you clean up  Nat shit for a living  I'd love to hear about that  for a few hours  front page of the  Atlanta Journal  Constitution  swamped  Gulf Coast  walloped  Twister's  Georgia  but they have the best  picture so far  on the front page  most front pages  they're showing  you know  the rising water  with people in rowboats  and stuff  right  this guy's on a jet ski  with a fireman  as a father 
[01:01:30]  is handing over  his newborn baby  from a rooftop  nice  that's the best picture  I've seen so far  onto a jet ski  we were talking about that  how cool a jet ski  would be  oh hell yeah  just ripping it up  South Florida  Sun Sentinel  death destruction  scores killed  as Katrina pounds  states along Gulf Coast  and they have the  people on the rooftops  as well  with the boat  and it goes on  and on  oh  yes 
[01:02:00]  this just in  reports that the  Superdome bathroom  toilets  are not flushing  they have stopped  flushing  because of the flooding  that's gone on  so  wow  that is just  that sure conjures up  an image  man  what do you do  you get a few  thousand people  how many did they say  10,000  is that real  or is that one of our  things we're doing  no I'm getting  multiple reports  of that  you know how long 
[01:02:30]  that line must be  to the bathroom  you know there's a line  a line to go in there  and sit on what  they've got to be  full to the tippy top  I've seen them  right to the brim  Woodstock 94  we performed  they had in the  Port-A-Johns  and there's some of  them in the public  area  can we stay in the  artist tent  they had  it would pile out  you gotta tamp it  down before you  it was almost like  the sea level had  gone down  and you could see  the tip of the  mountain coming out  that's exactly what  it was like it was  it was the top  of a yummy sundae  poke it out  disgusting 
[01:03:00]  and the stink  that's gotta be  in there  just people  people that are  just sweating  because there's  no air conditioning  10,000 people  no toilets  flushing  wow  that is  brutal  what are they  gonna do  they're supposed to  and now a lot of  these people  don't even have  homes to go back to  yes thanks  so they gotta  hold them in there  thank god  the holes blew  in the roof  to maybe ventilate  a little bit  they're lucky  they have the  superdome  those people  would've been  fucked 
[01:03:30]  dead  yeah  yeesh  Panama City  Florida  their headline  Crescent City  flooded  Katrina  not quite  the doomsday  machine  Nolans  dreaded  but category  four storm  leaves its mark  across city  and rest of  Gulf Coast  see that's a  real  paper's headline  and almost every  paper talking about  how gasoline  prices expected  to surge  of course  these scumbags  these vultures  they're gonna  take advantage  of it  so  we have a  montage of  reporters covering 
[01:04:00]  the hurricane  outside Anthony  I saw this tape  on TV today  it's pretty funny  let's see if  the audio works  here  so bringing  folks up to  the minute  coverage on  a hurricane  is no small  job but it's  a job that's  harder on some  than others  there were so  many reporters  out yesterday  trying to give  you some sense  of the ferocity  of the winds  and how heavy  that rain was  so let's take a  look at what  some of them  went through  I'm just looking  to make sure  we're not going  to get whacked  in the head  with anything  we're making our  way over here 
[01:04:30]  what we're looking  through the TV lens  is the emotion  the real thing  here that  the power  just went out 
[01:05:00]  we found a  confirmed wind gust  of 76 miles  per hour  at the Mobile  Regional Airport  these are the  hurricane forces  men  alright that's it guys  I'm going to come  back in  oh  whoa  yep  look at the water  on the main road  it's up to my knees  debris  now started to fly  look at the air  we've been here  for four hours  and it's just a  constant  relentless barrage  of the wind 
[01:05:30]  and the power  there  as a matter of  fact we're getting  some pretty strong  wind gusts here  some of the strongest  we've seen so far  alright well there you  have it  did you see the  goggles guy  yeah yeah  goggles  it looks ridiculous  yeah they're saying  no water pressure  because the water  mains burst  and that's why  there's no  flushing going on  oof  super dumb  that would be  a nightmare  imagine the stench  of your home  after you go back 
[01:06:00]  and all that  filthy New Orleans  water  because you know  let's be honest  especially down  in the French Quarter  it's just dirty  yeah  it's filthy there  on a daily basis  you walk out  and that place  just stinks man  god remember that  after Mardi Gras  the next day  when we're pulling  our luggage  down the street  and it just  smelled like  stale beer  and vomit  they cleaned up  quick there though  I'll tell you that  they was impressive  how fast they got  they don't mess around  alright we're gonna  take our first break  wow we've been out  in an hour already  what is Patty  doing here  she got gifts for us  it better be chocolate 
[01:06:30]  we'll see what she's about  after the break I guess  but you know what  Steve  you're not getting  off easy  Eric you write this note  no it's from him  problem  Steve  Steve hands me a note  it says new Ramon promo  today into break  oh  oh I wasn't trying  to get off easy  I'm sorry  like all of a sudden  we would just go  hey we'll be back  after these messages  and all of a sudden  the Ramon promo  would just play  without us commenting  no no no no  I wasn't Steve  I wasn't trying  to get off easy  Steve  what  Steve  what  let me  Steve  let me talk 
[01:07:00]  Steve  oh I'm sorry  all those  all those  all those parties  with that  empty thing of honey  just bees on his face  in the back of his hands  no one's talking to him  mama bear walking away  his empty bowl of porridge  wow now they got  the helicopters  getting people  off the roofs  nice  wow look at that  alright well Steve  we want to hear 
[01:07:30]  the Ramon promo  ok  so we can comment  about it  oh well you want  to do it afterwards  then  no we're going  to do it right now  ok  no Opie  you made a mistake  this is uh  they're just playing  Black Hawk Down  I thought it was  funnier than that  it's actually funny  but it's also like  alright  we got to get that  that gasp  uh gasp  uh sound effect 
[01:08:00]  where everyone just goes  the whole crowd  used to have that one too  alright uh  Nathaniel  let's uh  debut the brand new  Ramon promo here  as Steve's in studio  golfing is a wonderful  way to spend an afternoon  a true test  of dexterity  skill  and  oh  seems to have  landed in some  dog mess  oh not again  Ramon  wash my balls  I liked it 
[01:08:30]  except for the fact  that you said  dog mess  what  dog mess  you could have said  dog shit  I could have said  dog shit  but I was trying to  I guess  I guess  choose  choose the words  a little bit more  distinctly  I want to know  how long you sat there  and toiled  as to  how can I make it  balls  um  like  just one ball  goes into shit  I gotta have this  motherfucker  tee off twice  he wakes up  you should mention that 
[01:09:00]  because I really  agonized over that  I know he agonized  over  clean my ball  doesn't make sense  yeah  he's gotta do it twice  he wakes up  hearing the punchline  yeah  I do  he's absolutely right  over the vacation  I was driving  he toiled over that  I was driving  to pick up  the mail in the P.O. box  and I  I said  you know what  I gotta figure out  how to get him to say  Ramon wash my balls  or Ramon clean my balls  and for two days  I was setting up  the scenario  and one golf ball 
[01:09:30]  didn't make sense  so it had to be  two golf balls  so he had to tee off  twice  you didn't really  give him much time  to tee up the ball  but you know what it is  it's a home driving range  it's a home driving range  oh is it  so he's there  and I guess  what's the proper term  chipping or slicing  I guess  it's really not in the air  long before it hits  right  it's just chipping  some chipping  some golf ball  exactly  so that's where it's going  before it hits  the pilot dog crap  and why is there dog crap  on his driving range  because he's got a dog  why hasn't Ramon  cleaned up the dog shit  Ramon's getting lazy 
[01:10:00]  apparently  he's psychotic  among Ramon's  responsibilities  would be of course  to clean the dog shit  off the golf course  but today he hasn't  so he's got to wash  the golf balls  right  of course  and was it  two separate piles  of dog shit  that he hit  yes indeed it was  wow  yeah no he's not  because  now I would assume  the place is littered  with dog shit  if two separate balls  actually hit dog shit  and how could he tell  immediately that he hit  dog shit  you don't hit a ball  five feet 
[01:10:30]  you hit it a hundred yards  how could you say  that it was in dog shit  if you listen  really the ball  was not in midair that long  so it really obviously hit  now I gotta hear it again  yeah  alright let's hear it again  this is the brand new  Ramon promo  golfing is a wonderful way  to spend an afternoon  a true test  of dexterity  skill  and  oh  seems to have landed  in some dog mess  oh not again  Ramon  wash my balls 
[01:11:00]  so what  what is he  swinging it into  a wall  of dog shit  oh my god  oh look at that  yeah there's the guy  running for the old guy  look he's stuck on his brakes  oh there's the brake lights  oh  you're a dumb old codger  yeah  they've been playing that clip  on CNN  the old guy driving  into the water  uh  well Steve  alright  I like it  um  it's a little weird  the whole two piles of shit  I wouldn't have said doggy mess 
[01:11:30]  but I still like it  thank you very much  and the swing did sound a lot more like a driver  than a  of course it wasn't a putt  than a  no I didn't say it was a putt  alright  I didn't say it was a putt  something  and for the speed of the club  you know  it didn't  it sound like the ball hit  too quickly  yeah of course it did  whack land  well no  it was in the air  for maybe a second and a half  so that gives it  what a good  maybe 30 yards  no  no  no  not at all  no 
[01:12:00]  a second and a half  would go a lot further  really  yeah  and  he'd be lofting it in the air  it would actually be in the air  pretty long  in a high arc  if he was chipping  and swinging this club that quickly  well maybe he's not that good  maybe it's actually going off  to the side a little bit  maybe he's got a slice  and maybe he's very slow in his life  except for that part  because he talks very slowly  right  I'm going to play golf  hit chip  hit chip  now Ramone  alright  thank you Steve 
[01:12:30]  you're welcome  that's good  very good  I heard yesterday  they broke it down to  one toilet per 100 people  at the Superdome  wow  that's coming in  through the instant feedback  when we get back  we'll talk to Stalker Patty  she's got gifts for us  once again  obviously she needs some attention  we'll give it to her next  ugh  there was something else  something big  after the break  what?

[01:13:00]  two local anchors  going at it  because one guy  mispronounced  Donald Trump's  wife's name  and the other guy  called him out  and he actually  didn't mispronounce it  I don't think  I think he actually  got it right  alright we got  golden ticket hopefuls  today  we got bombs and flubs  volume 3 today  we got the Tom Sizemore  sex tapes  ugh  still haven't talked  about that  we have a brand new  video and audio tape  of a woman getting tased  we love these things  we'll do that after the break  another video clip  that is just fantastic

[01:17:30]  from behind the tripod  and told me  that he hadn't got on  I told him  I'd just hang around  until they came back  apparently this guy is bald  he told me  and I quote  oh no you won't  I'll fucking kill you  you bastards  got me two other times  and it won't happen again  I'll fucking kill you  then he tried to grab  the sign out of my hands  I quickly walked away  it's getting hard  to get these reporters  in New York City  Ross  yeah we got them  frazzled in New York  that's for sure  threatening to kill him 
[01:18:00]  yeah  and he had gotten him  two other times man  good  they'll get you again too  stupid  yeah they'll get you  we love the assault  in the media contest  we absolutely love it  we're doing it  every single month  yeah  August was a weird month  because we took off  for vacation and stuff  but we do have a leader  it's Stephen the Lion Man  in Alabama  remember that one Anthony  yeah I believe that video  is still up on  opianthony.com  foundrymusic.com  I think Steve should  move it to the top  of the list of things  to look at  so people could take 
[01:18:30]  a gander at that  for the month of August  the prizes  for the best assault  on the media  they are  a MiFi portable  satellite radio  I believe  Ziggy helped us out  with that  right from  myradiostore.com  yeah  alright also  now is that something  that you have to plug  into a big docking unit  in order to listen  to programming  or can you actually  listen to  actual live  satellite programming  from XM  with an XM MiFi  you don't want me  to answer that  do you  the farce 
[01:19:00]  the lies  that come out  of Sirius  right  do we have the audio  of that one  here's the leading  assault of the media  for the month of August  I don't think anyone's  going to beat Stephen  at this point  we only got two days  left in the contest  for August  and then we start it up  again for September  here's the audio  of his assault  here's Dolores Keith  Dolores  alright thanks Mark  of course there are a lot  of great reasons  why people love Auburn  now most parents  with school age children  love it because  of its great 
[01:19:30]  public school system  and there he is  in all his glory  if you have seen  the video  in his Lion Man costume  he's in a lion suit  come on  lion suit  and a big  Open Anthony  XM sign  on cardboard  he hit early  in August  and no one  has been able  to come close  Anthony  yeah  and so  it's looking like  Stephen's going to  win the contest  unless something  happens in the next  couple of days  the my fi  he gets  if he wins  dinner with E-Rock  at Paisano 
[01:20:00]  of Mulberry Street  in the heart  of Little Italy  what  is that part  of the prize  it now is  you're going to  take the winner  to dinner  at Paisano  Eric is  yes  is it D-Y-O-M  bring your own  mayo  I'm with you  bring your own  mouthwash  oh god  take it as you  take it as you  please  that got a big  reaction in the booth 
[01:20:30]  there Anthony  what do you imply  that that was  Joey's idea  to have him come  so people  wouldn't eat much  I think it'll be  fun  Eric's a fun guy  you'll enjoy  hanging out with him  he's what we call  a sweet boy  also a trip  to the studio  to watch the O&A show  through a glass partition  no transportation  included  what  I thought he was  one of the winners  it's your birthday  right  what  there's some listener  out the window  yeah  no no no  don't let him in  here  look at him 
[01:21:00]  he's stood up  he's walking around  I'll go to the door  no not the door  he even cleared  his door  I saw him  I'm ready to go  on the air  no I'm not  sit down  at this point  people have shown up  every day  to check out the show  and some we let in  and some we say  get lost  and here's the little  formula  if it's between the hours  of 7 and 11  and you have tits  you can come in  alright well  just reading the funny papers  alright hold on a minute 
[01:21:30]  let me finish with this  assault on the media  wait  Jimmy's reading the funny papers  also added to the prize  list  for the month of August  a 30 day  free rental  of the latest video games  from Gamefly.com  nice  so if you're into  the video games  you're going to get  30 days of free rentals  thanks to Gamefly.com  oh Ben has something  to add  another edition  a pair of tickets  to see Bon Jovi  opening night  at that new Nokia  theater in Times Square  when's opening night  sweetie  it's September 19th 
[01:22:00]  oh to Bobby God  I'd love to go see it  but the problem is  if this guy wins  from Alabama  he's going to have  to get his ass  to New York  to win all these  fine prizes right  well this contest  as we move along  we'll get better and better  and maybe we'll get  a sponsor that'll  actually fly people in  to do all this stuff  but still at the worst  the guy will get  the MiFi  he'll get the 30 day  free rental  for video games  courtesy of Gamefly.com  and the other stuff  if he can get his ass  to New York  so there you have it  Anthony we did have  three assaults 
[01:22:30]  on the media  during our vacation  a megaphone was used  in all the  in all the assaults  on the media  I love that they're  using the megaphones now  and these videos  are up on  opanthony.com  and foundyourmusic.com  all three  falling  just short  yeah  there were some  errors made  a few people  didn't quite know  what to do  panicky peats  so uh  yeah  I don't think  these are going to  be in the money  these are all 
[01:23:00]  from Sonny Ferrelli  we were talking  to Sonny Ferrelli  yesterday on the  program  well here we go  WHDH  Dan Housley again  Housley again  versus Sonny Ferrelli  my team's  Dan Housley  is there live  Dan  well as you can see  the streets are crowded  with Stones fans  and they're all happy  with what happened  and didn't happen  won't be an Anthony  you heard him  the whole time  but that last one  was a little louder  than the other one  well listen again  really  it's a quick clip  St. Opie and Anthony 
[01:23:30]  XM Satellite Radio  well the pest  there  made Dan Housley  raise his voice  in the middle  of his report  listen  my team's  Dan Housley  is there live  Dan  well as you can see  the streets are crowded  with Stones fans  and they're all happy  with what happened  and didn't happen  as you can see  the streets are crowded  so uh  I guess  I guess all the news trucks  were set in the same area  because Sonny Farrelly 
[01:24:00]  hit three different  news channels  within a half hour period  so he went from  WHDH in Boston  to Fox 25  Fenway Park  was the kickoff  of the Stones  in North America  and soar  they're going to be back  in Boston  sometime soon  we hope  but they're off to Hartford  after this  we're live outside  Fenway tonight  I'm John Monaghan  Fox 25 News  alright John  thanks  I can hear him back  Dopey and Anthony  on XM Satellite Radio  well he's on a megaphone  right  yeah  huh  oh yes Hawk 
[01:24:30]  Hawk what  he's yelling in the back  he's like don't spit on me  you bastard  apparently the reporter  had spit on him  one time from the top  of the van  oh really  alright so then  Sonny Farrelly  wasn't done  he went to CBS 4  photos we obtained  from a concert goer  reveal a harrowing  half hour  watching a Westport  that guy's got to get  some kind of credit  though for ruining three  yeah  he ruins the quantity  in one day  yeah  one day he did  three assaults on the media  it's that easy  but I gotta say  I think these fell short 
[01:25:00]  and uh  and Lion Man in Alabama  still in the lead  for the assault on the media  contest for August  and we'll start it up again  in September  with even  even better prizes  yes  so there you have it  that's that update  okay  you were laughing at something  I didn't mean to laugh out loud  but I just  it was probably something  so funny  that you just couldn't  contain yourself  the funny papers  I don't know how people  don't read the comics  this one's  this is Marmaduke  and uh  the dog's in a police car  and the caption reads  no you can't blow the siren 
[01:25:30]  and Marmaduke must have been asking  does anyone read those things  that's it  that's uh  that was it huh  no you can't blow the siren  Beetlebelly  it's just  it's great  how do you drive  there's two captions  in the  because  Theorella  LaGuardia right  or Theorella  whatever  LaGuardia  whatever  LaGuardia  yeah  who would he read the funny papers to 
[01:26:00]  when there was a problem right  yeah yeah  he would get on the news  on the radio  and read the funny papers  when there was  I believe there was a strike  or something  yes  and yeah  this is uh  this Beetle Bailey one  this is two  two little captions  here  and this one  this Beetle  he's opening a Vox  and he goes  new racket  Sarge won't be able to hit one past this baby  and in the next caption  it's a big tennis racket  and he goes  help me lift it 
[01:26:30]  will ya  Sarge is never gonna get one past that one  but he can't lift it  because it's a big racket  Beetle  I get it  read Herman  I don't even get Herman  where's Herman  Herman's are always funny  Herman right to the right  of Beetle Bailey  okay  it's one caption  it's uh  two older people  in the romance section  of a bookstore  uh oh 
[01:27:00]  racy  and she's reading something  and the older gentleman says  wanna go see a movie  baby  that's Herman  I don't get that at all  but  but I don't get it  I didn't get the Herman  read Flight Deck  this is Jimmy's new bit  and I love it  read Flight Deck  well Flight Deck is pretty funny  it's got a woman with weird hair  and two guys  sitting on the side of her 
[01:27:30]  and the one guy goes  don't you  don't you  wow this is gonna be a good one  don't you find it  a little strange  a Chinese restaurant named  unlucky house  wait wait wait  wait come on  the people have to understand  what you're saying  I'm sorry  yeah  don't you find it  a little strange  a Chinese restaurant named  unlucky house  and the other guy goes  no  this place is great 
[01:28:00]  I see what your misfortune cookie says  it doesn't say that  it does  no this place is great  see what your misfortune cookie says  I just said that  you said I see  oh okay  but it's still the misfortune cookie  of course  of course  misfortune  instead of fortune  my favorite though  of all time  has always been  the lockhorns  oh they are so funny  let's go to the lockhorns  that old couple 
[01:28:30]  it's been together for years  okay  Jimmy  are you gonna make me  try to get through this one  yeah  all right  in the uh  in this one  she walks in  and there's a crib  and there's  a little  a lump laying in it  and it looks like  red stuff on the side  and she says  honey  what happened to the baby  and he says  I fucked it to death 
[01:29:00]  what the fuck is wrong with you  I love those lockhorns  did you get a different version of the paper  did I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I 
[01:29:30]  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  dude  who  I just Don't  I don't get these at all  the like  if you know  the cartoons are really funny  is the ones  that are in the post  actual political cartoonist  yeah  that guy's brilliant  whoever does those  and the  and the far sides  were always good  yeah but  these were entertaining  probably in the 30s  yeah  like the comic strip  and the paper  you know  back in the 30s  when  people just  pretty much had radio  and comics 
[01:30:00]  like  but  they're kind of  does anyone really  I'm not really reading these anymore.  I used to as a little kid in Newsday.  These things never start or finish.  It's just dreck.  Dreck.  Like this one here.  Oh, Patty, come on in.  Hold on.  She has to leave.  All right, come in, Patty.  Come on in, plant lady.  Damn it.  Your boxes.  Come on in.  Come on in.  Move.  Patty.  Hurry up. 
[01:30:30]  Come on in, miss.  But you're taking forever.  Hurry up.  Come on in, miss.  I need attention today.  Hurry up.  Patty.  Hi.  I wish I could stay, but I can't.  What did you bring?  Oh, my God, you can't.  Did you bring chocolate?  Yes, I did.  Bring it in.  Where is it?  Jesus Christ.  Oh, here it is.  Why do you come out the candy?  One of the write-offs in the store.  No one cares.  What kind of chocolate?  One is pecan croquant, which is like solid chocolate with nuts.  And the other one's a raspberry caramel.  What's the first one called?  Pecan croquant. 
[01:31:00]  I've got to try one.  A solid chocolate with pecan.  Pecan croquant.  Why, why when she says that, do I have to physically restrain my fist from lining up  into her gums?  Why?  Yeah, it's a croquant.  Pecan croquant.  They haven't been opened yet.  What?  I hope not.  They haven't been opened.  Is it a fresh box of pecan croquant?  Yeah.  They just came in over the summer.  Oh, I can't.  It's got printing on top.  Can I eat that?  Yes, you can.  It's part of it.  How do you like it?  It's a raspberry caramel. 
[01:31:30]  Oh.  That's wonderful.  Now, wait about the croquant, Jimmy.  Oh, my God.  I don't want a croquant.  Oh, yes, you do.  It's just solid chocolate with pecans in it, Anthony.  I don't like pecans.  No problem.  No problem.  You know what I hate when people call them pecans?  The word pecans sends me into a rage.  How about pecans?  Pecans.  Some people say pecans.  Oh, stop. 
[01:32:00]  All right, Patty, you're going to wear that wow shirt to work?  There's writing on the bottom.  Can I eat this?  I'm doing shipments.  Did you do your laundry?  Is that?  Look at your shirt.  I was doing shipments.  I get boxes.  I have to carry and lift boxes and stuff.  What are you doing?  You're off work.  Perform back alley abortions?  Jesus Christ.  Your shirt's filthy.  No.  No, I'm just in my stockroom clothes.  I also have to do the ordering and stuff before I leave. 
[01:32:30]  Great.  Patty, Patty, Patty, put it in terms people can understand.  Yeah, please.  You're done.  I don't want any of that chocolate.  You've dropped off.  Yeah, well, anyway, I just started doing it right off.  You got anything on Hurricane Katrina?  Any thoughts?  Yeah, I thought that New Orleans was going to be like the lost continent of Atlantis, the way they were putting it.  But it's not as bad as they thought they said it would be. 
[01:33:00]  Patty, it's pretty bad.  Yeah, the only thing is, I hope Tom's radio station is okay.  Yeah, who cares about human life?  Yeah.  Is his radio station okay?  Who knows and who cares, Patty?  Oh, I care.  Thanks, Patty.  Take care.  Thanks for that chocolate.  Thank you, Patty.  What do you think they're called again?  These are good.  They're good.  They're called C-R-O-Q.  No, no, seriously.  What are they called?  I don't remember.  I don't remember.  Crocans.  What kind?  It's a solid chocolate with just pecans. 
[01:33:30]  Can we throw them at you?  A pecans crocans.  Can we throw them at her?  A pecans crocans.  Give me a box of chocolate.  I want to start throwing them at Patty.  Don't bring in those crocans.  No, or the raspberry.  Come on.  We have a lot of them.  That raspberry's delicious.  I like the crocans.  I wouldn't eat anything called a crocans.  I don't like raspberry because it's raspberry and it just makes me physically ill that they would spell it like that.  But it's very good.  Bye. 
[01:34:00]  Why are you getting going?  Because I've got to go back to work.  Ah, he's throwing a crocant and a raspberry.  Oh, no.  I'll see you.  All right.  All right, Patty.  There she goes.  Love you.  All right, beat it.  Beat it, stupid.  She's having trouble opening the door.  Bye.  There she goes.  Bye, Patty.  Oh.  Just missed her head.  You've got to eat that, dude.  One more.  I'm done.  I'm not eating this stuff.  These are so good.  They are delicious.  Hey, guys, Sonny Ferelli checking in from whackbag.com. 
[01:34:30]  Sonny!  Hey, guys.  What's up?  I'll have one more.  What's up, Sonny?  What are you, gay?  I'm not going for a round, too.  Hey, listen.  Pre-marital and Boston Strangle did the third one.  It wasn't me.  Oh, okay.  Oh.  I just wanted to clarify that.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  You know you fell just short, all you guys.  Yeah, I know.  I just wanted to get credit for them.  That's all.  All right.  And I guess tomorrow's the last day of August, right?  Yep.  So we'll announce the winner of the Assault on the Media contest for August on Thursday morning.  Thank you, Sonny.  All right. 
[01:35:00]  Punching out.  All right.  There you go.  Sonny Ferelli.  You know what, guys?  What?  I feel that we're a little bit negative on this show.  And at one point, I was reading Harriet Cole.  Harriet Cole?  Exactly.  Oh, the advice woman.  And sometimes I would like to do things that help people because I feel that we're a bit too negative on this.  All right.  Let's see Harriet Cole.  You're right.  I would like a feel-good show one day. 
[01:35:30]  Is she like the Dear Abby of the new generation?  Or the Ann Landers, as I would call her.  Why?  They were sisters.  Harriet Cole, though, is different looking.  Is she a nice...  Does anybody know where she's from?  She's a nice woman.  Where's my Harriet Cole?  Hawk, find his Harriet Cole article or I'm going to bite your stomach.  All right.  Yeah, cartoons.  That's a held appropriate last name.  Oh, Harriet Cook. 
[01:36:00]  She's hot, man.  Yeah, she is.  All right.  Go ahead.  I just...  I haven't read these, actually.  I just looked at the thing and said, Dear Harriet...  Harriet.  Ugh.  What should be done...  What...  Wait.  What should be one of the happiest times in my life is turning into a nightmare because of my mother-in-law.  Oh, that old mother-in-law.  I recently got married and we just returned from our honeymoon.  My mother-in-law called continuously on our honeymoon, which I felt was rude. 
[01:36:30]  Now that we're home, she insists on coming over constantly and insists...  Oh.  And she always has an unpleasant attitude.  I hate to continue to bring it up to my husband, but I don't know what to do to make her stop.  What should I do?  Barbara Dallas.  That's the woman calling up, bitching about the mother-in-law.  Oh, that's a mama's boy that went away and got married and the mother can't let him go. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, what a problem.  How does Harriet Cole solve this?  Dear Barbara, I spoke to a man who recently married who was telling me about his understanding of the marriage vows.  Ooh, I like this because they personalize it.  His focal point is forsaking all others, he explained.  In his case, that means all parents, family members, even the bride's children from a previous relationship whom he loves completely. 
[01:37:30]  Oh.  He explained that in order for their family to stand a chance of rebuilding a firm foundation and growing in a healthy manner in the future,  the two of them, husband and wife, must come first.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wife.  Let's borrow this wisdom for you and your husband.  See, that's why I like Harriet.  She always ties it up at the end.  This is horrid advice.  Harriet is good.  Don't underestimate Harriet.  You can disrespect a lot of things, but give Harriet Cole a chance, would you, for Pete's sake? 
[01:38:00]  This is how they tie it up.  You must bring up this issue with your husband and do not feel bad about doing so.  How about?  Stupid.  I don't like this advice.  Perhaps his mother is feeling a fate, but her relationship with her son, her son is attempting to bring an outside woman into this situation.  Don't you put a little lard on her stairway and a little graham cracker hip take out of the skull? 
[01:38:30]  Yes, that should be the advice.  Put poison in her tea.  Kill the old woman.  And hire two guineas to chop her body up.  Sincerely, Harriet.  All right.  Harriet Cole should be just murdered.  All right.  When we get back, we're going to do the taser story, the latest taser story.  Don't understand these people.  Listen to the police.  And we also have to get to the Tom Sizemore sex tape. 
[01:39:00]  I heard a little bit of this, and I was horrified.  Horrified.  This is the beauty of satellite radio.  We'll show you what this satellite radio can do next, all right?  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the ONA virus.  And Angelina Jolie may have checked into L.A.'s W. Westwood Hotel as Mr. and Mrs. Smith.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[01:39:30]  I wonder if they did.  This is publicity.  The stunt.  Mr. and Mrs. Smith.  They checked in under Mr. and Mrs. Smith.  This is a publicist behind all this stuff.  They're beating this up.  They love it.  Movie coming out, and they're getting this kind of press.  Oh, they're bang.  Put a rose.  Put a rose.  Yeah, room services come.  Look, we have this idea.  You know how that shit works. 
[01:40:00]  We have an idea.  After the premiere, you two, we've already reserved a room.  Oh, look, the W.  Go over there.  Sign it under Mr. and Mrs. Smith.  Because then that's the name of the movie.  And then, of course, we have your room set up.  Different rooms under different names that you'll go to and actually sleep in.  But in the morning, we're going to have you go into the one room and then come out for room service in your bathrobes.  Oh, this is going to be great. 
[01:40:30]  What's more exciting than that?  Angelina with her face in a pillow and her asshole wide open.  That would probably take a little bit of a priority on the excitement list.  Two words, Angelina, gaping.  Wow.  When he entered the room, that would have been a great story.  When the room service came, she's on her face and there's lard by the bed and her ass is in the air.  And he entered with a fistful lard.  Can I help you? 
[01:41:00]  Her hands are tied behind her back and her ass is up in the air.  I think poverty would take a back seat to that, huh?  Absolutely.  He kissed with lard cake hands.  Some intense spottled green leaf.  No explanation.  Your one shirt sleeve is rolled up.  See, that's proven that Hollywood, these guys just don't have a sense of humor. 
[01:41:30]  Because, like, Anthony set up the whole scene with the publicist, you know, setting up these things.  There's got to be one guy in Hollywood that goes, what the hell, let's really throw this over the top, this setting up scene.  Go out and get a tub of Crisco.  Right.  You.  You're going to be tied to the bed face down.  Could you whimper?  Brad, let's spread the lard on your arm.  Up to the elbow. 
[01:42:00]  That's a good one.  He's got, like, the lard, the shirt sleeve rolled up and the clothes put on his nose.  Room service.  Ooh, hard feet.  Cut me your hat.  Kirby and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?  Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you? 
[01:42:30]  Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?  All right.  We've got a brand new Taser story.  We love these stories of people getting tased. 
[01:43:00]  Absolutely.  They just don't listen.  If you get pulled over,  and the officer asks you to step out of the vehicle,  why don't you just get out?  Why don't you just step out of the goddamn vehicle and do what the cop says?  The longer you fight them and argue and hold on to the car and don't cooperate,  the closer you get to being tased.  And it certainly doesn't sound like fun to these people. 
[01:43:30]  Right, but it's fun to everyone listening.  I want to play the original one before we play the new one.  Yeah.  The one that we've played from time to time.  You got that there, Hawk?  One second.  And then we'll play the new one.  This is one of our favorites.  Listen to this.  How would you like it if you were tasered by a cop?  Well, this happened in Florida to one woman,  but police review all the cases where force is used.  They say this one was justified.  You be the judge. 
[01:44:00]  For speeding.  You're doing 51 miles an hour.  The speed limit down.  See, Christmas is 435.  Point and Beach police officer Rich McNevin pulled the driver of this Isuzu over for speeding.  He finds the driver, Victoria Goodwin, also has a broken windshield and a brake light out.  Officer McNevin then learns that Goodwin is driving without a license and returns to arrest her.  Should I put your cigarette out to step out of the vehicle for me?  But Goodwin stays in the car, talking on her phone.  Officer McNevin reaches in to pull her out.  He's arresting me.  Stop. 
[01:44:30]  Don't touch me.  The policeman is...  You're going to shoot me?  He's got a gun and he's going to shoot me.  Three times, Officer McNevin warns Goodwin that he will use his taser.  Get out of the car or I'm going to tase you.  The next street off the secret.  The officer hits her with his taser a second time. 
[01:45:00]  Goodwin screams and cries for two more minutes before officers move her to the squad car.  It's over and done with.  We've been tased before.  We know it's not that bad.  I don't care what you say.  I've never been tased before.  Okay.  The Palm Beach Post often Boynton Beach Training Sergeant Sedgwick Aiken to offer a police perspective.  Why use the taser while Goodwin was in the car?  She pulled away from him.  Basically, she escalated the use of force.  Why then was the second taser used while Goodwin was already on the ground? 
[01:45:30]  We haven't patted her down.  No one searched her to see if she has any weapons or anything on her person.  And if you go in and rush her and try to place hands on her, place on her wrist, she could injure her officer or become an injured herself.  All Boynton Beach police get tasered as part of their training so they do understand what they are doing to people when they do use their tasers.  What's going on?  All I'm going to say is, you know what that roll looked like? 
[01:46:00]  Just picture that roll happening off the top of one of the trade centers.  Just a roll off.  What is going on?  It's an old movie reference.  What are you guys looking at?  I'm still out of it.  We were watching the video of the new taser clip that you're going to be playing in a second.  And we were just laughing at the way she kind of toppled over as if biplanes had been shooting at her.  And she kind of tumbled. 
[01:46:30]  But look, you understand the cops.  I'm watching the video.  He's trying to tell her to do something.  Even if the cops are wrong or they're arresting you unjustly.  What do you think they're going to do if you resist?  Give up?  They apparently had a problem, it looked like, with some gentleman and this woman.  The gentleman's out of the car.  The woman's sitting behind the wheel.  Then they ask her to get out of the vehicle.  She won't.  They open her door and try to pull her out.  Now she's holding on to the door and the car and saying,  Don't touch me. 
[01:47:00]  Don't touch me.  Just fucking taser.  What did the cop get it?  And she doesn't know on her back is a little laser light from the taser just waiting for the guy to pull the trigger.  She's got no clue.  She's mouthing off to the cop.  And there's that laser pointer right on her back.  And eventually they just have had it with her and tase her.  But that's how, like, she's just all, don't touch me.  That's easier than getting smashed with a nightstick or having a, you know what I mean?  That's the best.  You want mace in your face, a quick tasing and you're done.  Yeah.  Well, we got the latest audio.  The video is up on opiananthony.com. 
[01:47:30]  So, here we go.  The latest tasing.  Open the door.  You're going to get tased.  Okay?  Open the door.  All I've got to say is.  Open the door.  I'm not drunk.  Open the door.  Open that door right there.  You're going to get tased.  Do you hear me?  Then get out.  Okay?  Go ahead and get out that door.  Thank you.  Step out.  Step out.  You don't have to trust me.  Yes, I do.  Step out of the car, ma'am.  No, you don't.  I'm getting out of the car voluntarily.  Get out of the car.  Step out now.  Okay, so you can get out of the car.  Get out of the car.  Step out.  You can't get off of me. 
[01:48:00]  I'm getting out voluntarily.  Step out.  I'm getting out voluntarily.  You can get off.  Ma'am.  Right now, you're under arrest.  Okay, get off of me.  You are under arrest.  That's fine.  Get off of me.  I'm getting out voluntarily.  Are you going to step out?  I'm getting out of my car.  She's getting out of my car.  Put your hands behind your back.  Look, how am I going to step in?  Put your hands behind your back.  I'm not.  I'm not.  Ha, ha, ha.  Put your hands behind your back.  Now.  Put your hands behind your back.  Oh, there is nothing better than a good tasing. 
[01:48:30]  That's where you get stupid.  As she's saying she's getting out voluntarily, she's holding on to the door.  Yeah.  And the cops are trying to pull her off the door, and she goes, get your hands off me.  You can't tell the cops to get your hands off.  So, if she let go of the door and put her hands behind her back, do you honestly think 
[01:49:00]  these guys would have tased her?  No.  No.  They would have cuffed her, and that would have been the end of it.  But she was fighting these guys.  I've got to hear the scream again.  Okay.  I know it's like, maybe you can forward in or something if you don't want to listen.  The scream is the best.  Can we see the video?  The video is up on opianthony.com.  Yeah, I got it right here.  Getting a lot of hits already this morning.  Oh, it's hilarious.  All right, get it down to about 25 seconds here.  Get off of me.  I'm under arrest.  That's fine.  Get off of me.  I'm getting out for a towel.  Are you going to step out?  I'm getting out for a fight.  She's getting out for a fight. 
[01:49:30]  Put your hands behind your back.  Put your hands behind your back.  Look, all I got to say, I'm not.  I'm not.  Put your hands behind your back.  Now, put your hands behind your back.  Put your hands behind your back.  Another nice touch to this whole thing is her pants are halfway down.  She's on her ass, and her thong is hanging out.  What a fucking dumb lump she calls. 
[01:50:00]  And then you see the guy just standing over with the little taser thing attached to her.  Hold the taser gun.  Boy, that shit really.  You know that they love to use that, too, because they don't.  Oh, they love it.  It's like a gun.  You're shooting somebody, but you're not killing them.  I know a few cops, and I've heard them talk like, oh, my God, to use the taser is the best thing.  It's just the most fun they have.  BAMP!  Does it go through clothes?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  The little barbs on there.  Didn't they hit her right in the back?  Yeah, got her right in the back.  Right in her fat back.  Yep.  In that fat back.  James Gunn would have loved that back. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, is that great?  Oh, the taser is still attached to her, I see.  Yeah.  The handcuffer is still in her back.  Yep.  All right.  Let's go to Jacob.  At the end of that clip, it sounded like the Tom Sizemore sex tapes.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  We can do that next.  Jacob, what's up?  Yes.  It's right.  You guys know.  I know how it's feeling getting tased.  I got tased like a month ago.  Tased now. 
[01:51:00]  It's kind of bullshit what happened to me.  Because I got, I was stopping a fight, and I kept saying I was involved.  I wasn't.  I'm trying to stop my two friends from fighting, and I got tased for no reason.  I don't understand that.  I'm trying to stop a fight.  I don't understand that one bit.  Sir?  One minute.  Sir?  Yeah?  How'd you get the head injury? 
[01:51:30]  Did they tase, did they tase you with a cannonball?  Yep.  They did.  Wow.  It, it tased me, like, five times.  Are you, are you okay?  Not really.  You have an interesting, you have an interesting speech pattern, sir.  Yeah, you have an interesting speech pattern.  I know I have a speech pattern, but. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, you do?  What happened?  I can't help it because it's from them.  It's from them?  Because it's from them.  Yeah, it's from them.  What are you, tasing the tongue?  All right.  Thank you, Jacob.  Fuck you.  Oh, aw.  He said, fuck you.  Aw.  We made him angry pointing out his speech problem.  Aw.  Now he's hanging, now he's in his room somewhere.  He hung the phone up, and now he's feeling all bad about himself.  Don't feel bad, mashed potatoes mouth.  We're glad you called in. 
[01:52:30]  All right, let's get Martini Steve back in studio today.  Oh, why?  Well, we got the Tom Sizemore sex tapes.  Or sex tape, and I don't know much about this.  I still haven't seen it.  Where did it come from?  I don't know.  We'll get all the details from Steve.  This is what satellite radio is all about.  We can play this unedited.  There's a copy of it on my desk.  I haven't taken it home yet.  Yeah.  Take a look-see.  Do you want to go on IMDb and explain some of the movies that Tom Sizemore was in it?  Tom Sizemore.  You know Tom Sizemore. 
[01:53:00]  He was in Black Hawk Down.  He was in Saving Private Ryan.  Might remember that.  A little movie called Saving Private Ryan.  True Romance.  Isn't that one?  Natural Born Killers.  Passenger 57.  Point Break.  He was the cop, by the way.  If you don't know who he is, he was the cop in Natural Born Killers who finally sits in the cell with Juliette Lewis.  And what, does she attack him or something?  He tries to bang her and she attacks him? 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, I think so, right?  Right?  Yeah.  He's great.  And then Born on the Fourth of July.  Who was he in that?  He was a vet.  Oh, okay.  Maybe it was a small part.  Probably was early on in his career.  And he was Sergeant Vinny Ventresca on China Beach.  Remember that series, China Beach?  Okay.  So what happened to him? 
[01:54:00]  Well, he's had some problems.  He went out with Heidi Fleiss too, right?  Very briefly.  Very briefly.  Had a few problems with the cocaine.  He seems to like the cocaine.  The booze.  The booze.  He's had some domestic problems.  Been arrested for him.  Jailed.  He's on probation.  He violated that probation or is it parole that you violate?  I don't know.  Maybe it's both.  He also got caught with a fake penis, right?  Yeah.  He was supposed to take a drug test and he had some kind of fake penis that is specially made  for passing your drug test. 
[01:54:30]  You fill it up with urine and it keeps it warm.  And it looks like a real penis, so if they're watching you actually take a leak into the  cup, you pull out this fake penis and take a leak with it.  And they found out he was using the fake penis.  All right.  So he decided to make what?  Sex tapes?  Yeah.  I think these were made in, I think, 2003.  He makes reference to that at some point in the tape.  And I'm sure at the time he wasn't planning on releasing them publicly, but he was videotaping 
[01:55:00]  himself having sex with Hollywood hookers, which are essentially porn stars or porn actresses.  And they...  Stupid phone.  What kind of ringtone?  He's got the oldie style.  It's one that's about to get turned off.  Who's calling you?  I don't know.  Who is calling you during the show?  I don't know.  Someone...  I will bet you anything it's my father who's calling me.  Steve has a rotary cell phone.  I certainly do.  It's the wife calling.  There's a young blonde girl in our child's bed. 
[01:55:30]  I...  There it is.  Wow.  Good one.  Wow.  Okay.  I saw these tapes.  They're just...  Just right.  All right.  Focus.  Focus.  Steve.  You're losing it.  Don't worry about your dumb cell phone.  I'm turning it off.  All right.  So they don't do that again.  Okay.  Okay.  Who was that? 
[01:56:00]  The berry delivery person?  Ten pounds of berries.  So how did the tapes get out there?  Tom Sizemore is broke and needs money.  He's going to jail for violating his parole.  And he's in rehab now, I think.  And he is...  He needs money.  That's the reason...  That's the only reason tapes that are this long with this much footage on it get out  is because the person that's in them had some intention of releasing them and making  a profit off them.  Wow.  That don't look that bad.  That chick doesn't look too bad on him. 
[01:56:30]  But, I mean, what happens to you after Hollywood spits you out?  You have his nose buried up her ass?  That's great.  These are very, very brutally graphic.  He looks all drugged out and stuff.  Yeah.  What a good guy.  Well, we got the audio of the tapes.  And there's some classic, classic audio here.  The first one, Tom introduces himself.  What's this about, Steve?  Just a brief little introduction to establish who the person in the thing is.  And he's, you know, sort of mumbling. 
[01:57:00]  Obviously, it helps to have the video in front of you when you're watching it because his  eyes are all glazed over.  Right.  He's, you know, his big bags under his eyes.  He's obviously been up for a few days.  They know they're being filmed, right?  Yeah.  This is not hidden camera.  He's holding the camera and pointing it at his face.  And some of these, it's a two or three camera shoot.  He's got porn chicks on either side of him operating cameras while he's eating ass or,  you know, getting a rim job.  So this is, this is not hidden camera work.  Wow.  All right.  Let's start with the first clip.  My name's Tom Sizemore. 
[01:57:30]  I didn't do it.  I deny all culpability.  I wasn't there.  It hasn't been even remotely fair.  Okay.  Okay.  So stick around.  Have a good time.  Mike, have a good time.  All right.  So that's the intro.  That's the intro.  What was he doing during that?  Just kind of hanging out?  That, that was, uh, he's about to, uh, get busy with, uh, uh, two or three girls in one 
[01:58:00]  bed.  And, uh, yeah, he's just, you know, he's just introing his home movie.  Uh-huh.  All right.  Here's the next clip.  It's February, 2003.  I dyed my hair at Rancho LaBrie.  That rhymes.  And then I did.  And, um, I've had a couple of the girls there bleached my hair.  And guess what else I did at Rancho LaBrie?  I fucked a whole bunch of the girls there.  And you're not supposed to.  You know why?  Because it's rehab. 
[01:58:30]  But I didn't, I didn't think my company didn't get rehab at all.  It was fine.  And I found out that it was doing just fine.  I hadn't met Carrie yet.  So that doesn't count as cheating.  That counts as me getting laid.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  So he was getting laid in rehab.  Yeah.  Rancho LaBrie is this little isolated, posh rehab center in, uh, California.  Okay.  How do you not love Todd Sizemore already?  Oh, he's the best.  Wait till you hear track six.  Wait till you hear track six. 
[01:59:00]  Uh, but first, here's track three.  He's, uh, trying to tell everyone how smart he is.  Yeah.  It's been my experience.  And I'm not saying I'm smart.  I'm not very smart.  But I'm not stupid.  Like, I know, like, Thomas Jefferson wrote the, uh, Declaration of Independence.  He didn't write the Constitution.  See, there was a whole bunch of guys.  Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Paine, Benjamin Franklin.  A whole bunch of guys.  They were called the Founding Fathers. 
[01:59:30]  How about that?  And they wrote it by where?  What city?  Philadelphia.  See, good for me.  And, like, you know what I paid attention to in school?  Whose tits were getting bigger.  That was, like, my main, main...  I'm just being honest.  That's what basically everybody's thinking about.  You know?  Is he talking to anybody?  He's talking to the camera.  You've got to understand the setup here.  Is he's talking to the camera while a girl is going down on him.  Oh.  Oh, you didn't explain that.  Sorry. 
[02:00:00]  That's a big one, Steve.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Makes it a little more interesting to listen to.  While a girl is going down on him.  In fact, he's engaged in some kind of sex act during a lot of this.  And a girl is going down on him.  And he's just in and out of some alcoholic and drug-induced stupor.  So, his mind is wandering all over the place.  The first one was too cold.  It certainly was.  Jimmy.  It starts to get good here.  So, here's more Tom Sizemore. 
[02:00:30]  You know what you would do if you were me?  You'd let Kara suck your cock.  All right.  What would you say?  Hey, stop it.  How dare you?  I'm unmarried.  I don't have a girlfriend.  Why do you want to do this to me?  Why are you offending my sense of...  Why is she doing this to me?  What's wrong with her?  She has a disease.  It's called a cox...  She's a cox sucker. 
[02:01:00]  You know what I'm saying?  Look.  In all seriousness.  Truth be told.  Whoa.  Was she doing the act there?  She's actually...  She's probably pulling his pants down even further  and going down on him while he's doing that.  What's he packing?  Not much.  Why would you release that?  Not much because he's broke.  Figures he can make some money on this.  He's hung like an acorn.  He's got movies coming out.  He's got five movies in post-production here. 
[02:01:30]  Six if you count this one.  Pre-production and two, three in post.  Yeah.  Counting this.  Those will all be direct-to-video.  You ask.  See, I wish people would buy a movie because I'd certainly love to release it.  I'd love people to see my delicious surprise.  There are sequences in this where he just gets on all fours in front of the camera and  just spreads cheek and just shows off his ass.  You've got to love that.  We're almost up to track six, but first is track five.  He bashes Heidi Fleiss here, right? 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  Having my choice between sucking my cock, I mean, having my cock sucked and going to jail,  I'm going to pick having my cock sucked.  Giving a choice between going to war and having my cock sucked, I'm going to pick having my cock sucked.  Giving a choice between fucking Heidi and having my cock sucked.  Trick question.  She wasn't much forgiving her head.  Oh, you know what?  This is a fictitious Heidi. 
[02:02:30]  This is not the Heidi you think it is.  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  I was trying to keep from being sued.  Yeah, it wasn't bad.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that movie coming out.  Fly Boys with Stephen Baldwin.  God, that's got to be good.  Oh, yeah.  Stephen Baldwin's really mysterious.  And he's got, oh, yeah, there's a bunch of nobodies.  Yeah, these are all direct-to-video stuff.  He's not going to get those choice roles now anytime soon.  No more Saving Private Ryan.  Well, here we go.  Track six. 
[02:03:00]  Track six.  Track six. 
[02:03:30]  Track six.  Why was he applauding?  It's pretty disturbing, huh?  Yeah.  And half the time that he's doing this, he's got, you know, he, especially in this next  track, you can see, he's getting, he's getting blown.  There's a dog barking.  There's a cell phone going off.  And the girl that's blowing him has a cigarette burning in one hand.  And she's, you know, butted up against another girl who's trying to sleep right next to her  and just sort of, not paying attention.  And the camera's being held by a third girl who's in the room because it's this above shot. 
[02:04:00]  And it's obvious that nobody in the, you know, frame could be holding the camera.  Yeah.  It is just, it's a mess of bodies on this, on this hotel room bed.  It's a mess of bodies on this, on this hotel room bed. 
[02:04:30]  Isn't that the sound of her blowing?  That slurping?  That is great.  Fuck.  He keeps going and going and going.  Moaning a little, ugh.  He's kind of creepy.  Yeah, where'd you?  His moaning takes me right out of the game.  No, see, I don't mind it because he's not talking. 
[02:05:00]  I just, I can't understand him.  I just hear her slurping, that dirty girl.  Fucking servicing.  Sloppy.  More Tom Sizemore.  Hey, camera's on again.  We're about to commit some more crimes.  I'm going to have sex with two women at the same time.  We're going to talk about something that's against the law.  Besides this here.  This is called, this is called cunnilingus or fellatio. 
[02:05:30]  I'm not sure.  One of them means I'm not a faggot.  And one of them means I'm a faggot.  So, whichever one of them means I'm not a faggot.  Oh, nothing against you faggots.  I want you to like me too.  Not that much.  Hey, my dick is short, huh?  I'm a grower, not a shower.  I'm an eagle maniac.  Wow, he is gone.  Yeah.  He has fallen.  I love him, dude.  Why do you love him?  Because he's just a raw, trying to dump a load male. 
[02:06:00]  How do you not?  And he's such a good actor.  How do you love him, man?  I mean, he's obviously very desperate and very sad.  Well, yeah, but he's also talented, so I kind of, you know, I just...  He was talented.  I think he could probably still act, but he's fallen.  I love the fact that he's just...  He's fallen hard.  But this is beautiful because he's such a mess.  He's us.  That's why I like what I'm hearing right now.  He's not like...  Imagine that dumb Brad Pitt did a fucking sex tape.  How he'd be polite and nice and he'd be gentle.  This fucking slob.  Chicks blowing him with a cigarette with a dog barking. 
[02:06:30]  How do you not love that?  That's my life.  See, I don't have three hookers.  I have one.  I can't afford three.  I gotta go to trial.  I gotta go to trial.  It's so fucked up, but I gotta go to trial.  I'll be able to.  There's something I didn't do.  I mean, I'm breaking the law.  I'm soliciting a prostitute.  A, it's against the law.  A, but look, it's what I do.  B, I use drugs.  But, you know, not that much.  Just when I'm awake.  And C, I didn't hit her. 
[02:07:00]  I didn't like her.  And the reason I broke up with her was because  whenever I went to anywhere I went,  she'd suck every cock in the room.  It probably kind of drains you out, you know?  Hey, LAPD.  One more time.  I want to make this really clear.  Fuck you.  Not that I don't like you guys,  but I just feel about you how you feel about me.  You don't like me.  I don't like you.  Think I'm afraid of you?  Wrong guy.  Okay, suck my fucking Detroit dick. 
[02:07:30]  I didn't hit that fucking clickety-clack bitch.  Bag of bones coming out of the rass fucking whore.  I didn't hit her.  All right?  Oh, he's a fucking classic, this dude.  That clickety-clack bitch.  Clickety-clack bitch.  Oh, he's so angry.  He hates the LAPD.  That's smart.  Oh.  That's real smart.  But I probably fucking gave him a hard time,  this poor fella.  Just trying to walk around with his rubber dick.  Trying to be left alone. 
[02:08:00]  Clickety-clack bitch.  That's clickety-clack bitch.  That's a whack-bag name.  That's a good one.  Clickety-clack bitch.  All right, what's the next track there, Steve?  Sweetie.  Oh, this is the setup here.  He's in a hotel room.  He's got four porn chicks.  Everyone's naked.  There's one of those mechanical bull dildo things.  I don't know what they're called.  I want to say Zibian or something like that,  but it might not.  And the girl that's riding it and him  are having some in-depth discussion  about how much they like pussy  while he's getting blown 
[02:08:30]  and two girls are on this mechanical bull dildo.  It's a very obscure scene.  Oh, fuck yeah.  I love pussy.  It's a very obscure scene?  Sorry, I'm odd.  Sorry, odd.  Yeah, that's a little out of the way.  Sorry.  I was really reaching for a big word.  Is it an independent scene?  All right, smash me.  That was a bad...  This is like a real film festival scene.  Really obscure.  It's hard to find.  I was reaching for a big word 
[02:09:00]  and I failed.  I apologize.  Oh, fuck yeah.  I love pussy.  Me too.  I love pussy.  I really love pussy.  I love pussy.  Do you love dicks too?  Oh, I like the pussies.  Do you like the pussies better?  Me too.  We get a lot in common.  Oh, I love a lot in common.  I love pussies too.  I love the pussies.  I love the girls stuck in my nipples.  Oh, I love pussies too.  I have a pussy too.  It's in my dick.  We are failing.  It's in my dick. 
[02:09:30]  My pussy's in my dick.  If you suck it really long forever,  then it turns into a pussy.  It's weird.  It can nutate into a pussy.  He's the worst.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Damn it.  I hate stepping on that one.  That's a...  That's fun.  He's a bad dirty talker.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  What was that about?  If I get a dick that turns into a pussy, would you suck it forever?  Jesus, Tom.  You're awful at this.  How do you not...  Be smooth.  Like, I'm talking...  Use the script.  I'm talking dirty.  I'll say something like, um... 
[02:10:00]  That's right.  Take that you know what.  I like pussy.  I like honey.  I like honey.  I like honey.  It's a very obscure...  It's a very obscure condiment.  Someone that agrees with Jim Norton.  Howard, what's up?  Yeah, I'm in total agreeance with Jimmy, man.  That just makes me, like, freaking...  Like him even more as a movie star,  because he's like a regular guy, man.  You know, porn, chicks, blow. 
[02:10:30]  Sure, man.  You know, that's fucking awesome.  He's not abusing the girls, you know.  He's just getting blown.  High-priced girls, too.  I totally agree with your bigger fan now.  Yeah, absolutely.  There's a desperation there, though.  I agree.  The guy, you know, was big in Hollywood,  and now he's making sex tapes  and releasing them on the Internet.  When you hit it big, Jimmy, in Hollywood,  don't spit all your money on hookers and blow.  Dude, I don't do any type of drugs.  Most of my money goes into having my genitals catered to,  as they say.  All right.  Related.  And held, and just have a girl go,  ah-ha. 
[02:11:00]  Ah.  More of the Tom Sidesmore sex tape audio.  What's this next track there, Steve?  This guy, he's so far gone.  Jim talks about having his genitals held.  This guy wants them broken off,  as you'll hear in this clip.  He's getting an aggressive rim job,  and he wants this girl to, like,  tear his nuts off as she's doing it.  Oh.  Oh.  Motherfucker, yeah.  Harder.  Oh.  Oh.  Harder.  Oh, you can't do it hard enough. 
[02:11:30]  Like, breaking the motherfuckers off.  Oh.  Oh, fuck, yeah.  Somebody.  Oh, fuck, yeah.  Oh, fuck, yeah.  Oh, fuck, yeah.  Oh.  You girls are so fucking cute.  I can't get a heart out right now,  you know why?  I'm worried about the goddamn fucking court case. 
[02:12:00]  Someone have to worry about this court case.  I don't have to worry about the court case.  Say, don't worry about the court case.  I don't worry about it.  The fucking mind's fucked up.  I need more pussy.  I just need more pussy.  I gotta get overstimulated.  I'm joking.  It's a joke.  It's a joke.  All right.  The obvious.  What's that noise?  Is he getting blown in a lawn doctor? 
[02:12:30]  Oh, sorry.  Is he getting blown in a lawn doctor service center?  That's this big, mechanical, bull-looking dildo.  It's just you've got one girl operating a little attenuator on the side.  And it just vibrates and...  A little what on the side?  It's an attenuator.  It's a little attenuator.  Oh, it's that obscure thing.  All right, Dan.  For fuck's sake.  It's not a bad attenuator.  It's a new Schwarzenegger movie.  Potentiometer.  It's like a volume knob for the large...  The, like, 902 millibars? 
[02:13:00]  Steve.  Steve.  Steve.  Let me talk.  Put it in terms so people can understand.  It's a vibrator.  It's a big riding vibrator with a volume knob on it.  On the side, if you will.  Let's move on here.  Track 12, Steve.  What's this about?  Oh, another monologue about how much he does not like the police and he wants them dead.  And he gets into an argument with the young lady who's servicing him.  The hooker?  Yes.  And the hooker likes the police.  The hooker loves the police.  I've never had an STD in my life. 
[02:13:30]  I have my cameras over here.  I'm going to say just for the record.  I have cancer of the pancreas.  I have cancer of the plane.  But I don't have chlamydia.  Really, I have cancer of the police.  I have a cancer of the police.  They grow on you?  No.  It's Friday, right?  And you just find a big mole and it starts growing and growing and it pops out?  No, I'm hoping that over the weekend, 22 cops are murdered.  Yes.  Don't say that.  I hope they have lots of kids. 
[02:14:00]  Oh, come on.  The people do.  When they're not with the police.  I mean, generally speaking, you feel about people how they feel about you.  And you know what?  They've been very nice to me.  Truth be told.  But you feel sorry for them?  You know the machine?  I feel sorry?  Fuck feeling sorry for them.  They've cost me $40 million.  This fucking blue hair.  Yeah, but I feel sorry for the whole system that's so fucked up that it works that way.  Well, I feel sorry for the system.  I feel sorry for the system.  Okay, I feel sad.  You make a dick shortener.  No, no, no.  What you just said to me was a dick shortener.  Okay, don't feel sorry for it.  I feel sad that our country is like that. 
[02:14:30]  Because you are above that.  You see?  Hey, give me my camera.  When a good person is persecuted.  Give me my camera.  Okay.  Wait, did you beat her with the camera?  When the good son is persecuted.  Shut up, bitch.  How great.  He didn't grovel.  She's used to talking to having guys go, ah, good point.  He's like, that's a dick shortener.  Yeah, shut up.  Exactly.  And the whole time they're naked, right?  Yeah, the whole time they're naked.  That's the system.  It's a shut up, whore.  That's a dick shortener. 
[02:15:00]  That's a dick shortener, you blue-haired fucking...  All right, we got two tracks left.  This one, what does Tom Sizemore do here?  This is what he actually did in the last clip was he picked up the camera and, no, he didn't  cave or head in with it, but he did.  He just looks into it and does a whole other rant about the system and how he hates the system.  Uh-huh.  All right, this is...  And then the last clip is, uh, Tom having a screaming orgasm, but first it's this.  For the record, I want to say...  No, no, hey, no, no, I'm not mad at you.  For the record, I feel sorry for the system. 
[02:15:30]  We love it.  That is...  You know why?  Because the system took all my money.  Well, listen, I got a million and change left that some fucking lawyer is going to get from me.  And I want to say this real quickly.  I love the police.  I think they're fly.  Very good.  I think they're bomb.  Very good.  Check this out.  I think the police are nice people.  Really nice.  I'd like to hang out.  What is she saying is so nice? 
[02:16:00]  Oh, she's just, uh, she's...  Uh, oh, because he disagreed with her before, and now she's happy that he's, uh...  Oh, it looked like she was looking at something.  Oh.  I'd like to hang out with him.  Hang too far for me.  Every day.  And smile.  Nice.  Hey, I just came in some girl's ass.  I know I'm controversial, and I don't give a fuck.  Hey, I just came in some girl's ass.  Wonderful.  He's just, he's a drug-induced stupor, and his brain is just shifting all over the place 
[02:16:30]  because he can't maintain a fuck for more than a couple seconds.  Where are these tapes?  Where can people find them?  Uh, there's links online.  There's links on opianthony.com.  All right, here's...  He's a dick shortener.  Here's the final track of the Tom Sizemore sex tape audio.  Oh, I'm gonna come.  I'm gonna come.  I'm coming.  I'm coming.  I'm coming.  I'm coming.  I'm in your faces.  I'm in your faces.  Okay.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  Oh.  Okay. 
[02:17:00]  Oh.  Oh, mother fucker.  Yeah.  Oh.  And cut.  Perfect.  Perfect, Tom.  A man of his size would easily have trouble coming on a face.  It's a wrap.  Wow.  Holy shit.  He's like putting him in position. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah.  Is that what he was doing?  Yeah, it's exactly.  Get over here.  Because he's lying down.  He's laying down.  And he just demands that they get their faces in the way.  Good.  So he's got a cat on his knees.  Nice.  He's paying for it.  They'll eat it.  Paying a lot for it.  Wow.  All right.  Well, there you have it.  The Tom Sizemore sex tapes.  Wonderful.  Well, yeah.  And you won't be hearing that on terrestrial radio.  Of course not.  You still want us to do a clean show?  Yeah.  Jesus.  All right.  You know, it was so much better when we had to kind of dodge these subjects and use double 
[02:18:00]  entendre.  No.  I like hearing him say, I just came in a girl's ass.  Absolutely.  All right.  Thank you, Steve, for that.  That's great stuff.  After the break, Bill Burr joins the program.  He's playing Carolines, I think, this weekend.  Very, very funny guy and friend of the show.  Absolutely.  We'll get him involved in the mix next.  As we go to break, when Tom Sizemore was getting his nuts turned and all that, it reminded  me of something we did in the studio a while back.  Really?  Well, the guy's getting kicked in the nuts. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, right.  The guy's getting kicked in the nuts by a dominatrix.  This is the real deal.  They, what, they were kneeling on the floor?  Yep.  Kneeling on the floor.  Just taking...  In their underwear.  Not just little soft kicks, by the way.  These guys, hardcore, were just getting kicked really, really hard in the nuts.  And here's the audio.  Two guys getting kicked hard right in the crotch with no protection. 
[02:19:00]  Wow!  I got it.  That's got him.  If he wasn't chained up, he would have fallen down.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  This is not right!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  That's got to be it!  That's got to be it!  Oh!  That's got to be it!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh my God!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  I can't get a good kick in from Grandma.  Grandma is lining up.  Oh! 
[02:19:30]  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Grandma like that!  Come on!  She's got the bullseye!  Grandma still got a chance, right?  Let's hear it for Grandma!  Grandma, put them down!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh! 
[02:20:00]  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, oh, oh. 
[02:20:30]  Oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[02:21:00]  I don't know how to follow Ted Sizemore busting a nut up.  I got nothing.  Tom.  Tom, silly.  Tom?  Oh.  Who's Ted Sizemore?  I don't know.  I don't know.  He plays football or something?  He's somebody.  But, yeah.  I think he plays for the Cardinals or something.  He was a catcher.  Wasn't he?  Yeah, he was a catcher.  That's it.  But what teams?  Because I vaguely remember it.  Like the Royals or the Cardinals?  Yeah, one of those dumb teams.  No offense to our St. Louis listeners. 
[02:21:30]  See, I'm starting off great, huh?  Ted Sizemore, really?  Well.  Yeah, that Ed Sizemore.  He's quite a character.  What do we know about New Orleans?  Because they're showing some pretty intense video on TV right now.  There's a house burning right now.  Opie, it doesn't look good.  I need a...  Yes, a Fox News alert.  It's flooded really bad.  Well, they said the levees, one of the levees, it broke. 
[02:22:00]  And it didn't have that quick flooding that they were talking about yesterday during the hurricane.  But now it seems everything is flooded.  The mayor came on and said 80% of the city is underwater.  Both airports are underwater.  The double-span bridge is destroyed, the mayor said.  Destroyed.  That's what he said.  And now there's fires, it seems.  Was Bill saying that's the only way into New Orleans?  By car, yes.  By car?  And there seems to be fires now breaking out. 
[02:22:30]  Fox News had a good house fire going.  And that just looks like it's just going to go down the block because there's no calling up the fire department and saying,  Hey, could you bring a truck in here and maybe put this thing out?  That sucks if you get your shit in the attic and you know my stuff is at least kind of safe.  Oh, yeah.  And then it burns.  There's nothing to do.  Yeah.  Hawk brought up an interesting point.  When the fire burns the house down completely and then the waters finally do recede,  you're going to get a perfect half of a house.  Like, completely burnt level where the water line was.  And then the fire will go out and then the waters recede and you have a half a house left. 
[02:23:00]  A little fidget house.  Oh, more raspberry.  And when is the water going to...  You didn't do anything to this, did you?  Why doesn't that...  Did you touch it?  You probably did.  I bet you did.  I bet he rubbed his teeth on it and gums and licked it.  Why do they look moist?  Because they are.  He touched them and he put his sweaty, nervous hands.  Sweaty chocolates.  We'll need it.  Why are you handing out chocolates to everybody in the middle of a very serious news break?  I'll tell you why.  He wanted chocolate.  That's right.  So he brought in chocolate for other people so it doesn't look bad.  Yeah, he was going to stuff his face.  Like, everyone's having chocolate.  He offered it to me when I was sitting out there. 
[02:23:30]  Did he?  He's like, would you like a chocolate?  He offered mayonnaise packets, too, because he loves those as well.  Put some mayo on there.  You should see him eat mayo, Phil.  That's his dream, right?  Oh, yeah.  Mayonnaise filled chocolate treat.  Have a pecan croquant, you fucking mayo-loving cocksucker.  Mayonnaise chocolate chocolate.  Awful.  Awful.  His face looks like Tom Sizemore's hookers after he's done.  I believe it's Ted.  Ted Sizemore, right?  Ted Sizemore was a catcher. 
[02:24:00]  Someone help us out with that.  He got the inspiration from those Franny Hilton tapes.  Franny?  Ted Sizemore was the 1969 Rookie of the Year.  For what team?  National League Rookie of the Year.  What team did he play for?  I don't know.  I said Cardinals.  You said what, Royals?  Royals is one of those teams.  National League does got to be...  It's definitely National League.  I will bet that.  Yeah, it says 1969 National League Rookie of the Year, but I don't know.  All right.  Well, that doesn't look good. 
[02:24:30]  Big oil slick.  Dude, where's that water going to go?  I mean, the drainage system, where does it go?  The pumps are down.  They're not pumping anymore.  Those things failed pretty early in the hurricane.  And those are used on a daily basis just to keep water out.  On normal sunny days, water seeps into New Orleans.  And now they have to figure out how to get all that water out.  They're talking about breaking open one of the levees so gravity can pull it back in.  But it's going to be a while before anyone can even get in there and look and see what they might be able to do. 
[02:25:00]  Will the water keep rising?  As long as the levee's broke and the water doesn't equalize between wherever it's coming from and wherever it is, yeah, it'll keep coming in.  The thing is, though, like, your possessions are in there and it's just rotting your place.  Look at all that water.  They just showed an aerial shot of a huge section and it's completely covered with water.  You know those insurance companies are already coming up with excuses not to pay any of these people?  Yeah, of course. 
[02:25:30]  They do that every time.  Ah, well, look, your car wasn't parked between the lines in the parking lot.  Yes.  And that's the type of excuse they'll use.  We're still seeing cars underwater.  We said this earlier, Bill.  If you had a car, why didn't you use it knowing this was coming?  Yeah, how about this car shouldn't be there.  They should all be gone.  Oh, that's a car lot.  That's a car lot.  Yeah, it looks like a car lot.  Oh, wow, that's a lot of inventory.  Oh, my goodness.  I sure hope they're all treated with that true coat. 
[02:26:00]  Wow.  Oh, that's a good deal, Wade.  That doesn't look good.  That doesn't look good.  That's my deal, Wade.  Is that a power line?  Love that one.  Yeah, it's a power line just kind of leaning in the water over the cars.  If a power line falls in that water, that's going to be...  How far does electricity travel in the water?  There's no power.  All the lights are out over there.  There's no power.  And that's why they're going to keep the power off for a very long time.  Yeah.  They're saying up to a month in some places.  They're telling people, don't even try to come home.  The people that left, evacuated, went elsewhere, don't even try to come home for at least a week. 
[02:26:30]  It's going to be a week before they can even tell them when they should be able to come home.  Some people have no home to come to.  And now the people that are at the Superdome, they're telling them they're not going to be able to go to their homes if they have any left for at least a week.  They're probably watching them on TV.  Can you imagine that?  Yeah.  Sitting there watching them.  My house on fire.  If they have a little portable battery-powered TV there.  Do you think they're showing movies at the Superdome or something?  No.  No power. 
[02:27:00]  There's no power.  There's no toilets.  Their toilets don't flush anymore over there.  So they're going to have to get National Guard in there with portable toilets.  I hear they're letting some of the people out into the breezeways and stuff so they can get some fresh air.  Because what they're saying is it just stinks in there of feces and BO and rotting food.  One toilet per hundred people.  Oh, my God.  Per hundred.  Really bad.  And now the roof came apart.  So all the water that leaked in made everything wet. 
[02:27:30]  And it's just not a healthy environment.  People are just dumping where they are.  Pissing.  Pissing into whatever they can't find.  Wonderful.  They're all flooded, man.  The entire city is underwater.  It's not the 30 feet that they had said.  But what's the difference between 10 feet and 20 or 30 feet?  It's destroyed.  It's going to get a lot worse, too, before it gets better.  It's worse than I thought it was going to be.  I've got to be honest.  Yeah, worse than I thought it was going to be.  That's why we kept saying yesterday.  We were making fun of a lot of the coverage. 
[02:28:00]  But we also were saying, hey, this is a very serious event.  They were talking like the buildings would be underwater up to the rooftops.  And, well, it's up.  The people are on the roofs.  They seem to be safe there.  But the worst of it isn't New Orleans.  It was east of New Orleans.  Mississippi.  And those people really got it bad.  That's how it started this morning, Ann.  But now they're starting to focus on New Orleans because this water is rising.  And there's another fire.  Yeah, these fires that break out.  They already know what they have to deal with in Mississippi and all that. 
[02:28:30]  But now they're trying to figure out, you know, the water is rising.  And they can't put out these fires that are starting up.  So it could get a lot uglier down there.  Get a close-up on that stupid fire.  I want to see.  The house next door started smoldering a little bit.  So that looked like it was going to go up.  There was an SUV in the carport.  Let's get a close-up of that horror.  I want to see that nightmare.  We were saying yesterday.  Well, why else are they showing this, Bill?  We were saying it yesterday.  The way they promo'd this on the news, it was like a movie trailer.  You're watching them saying, disaster is hours away from New Orleans. 
[02:29:00]  Stay tuned to Fox News.  Catastrophic.  Category 5 hurricane coming in.  What this means is 30-foot floodwaters, fires, fire ants, explosions, toxic chemical waste in the streets.  Alligators and wildlife.  Hundreds of thousands of people's lives are being threatened.  Incredible ratings.  Yeah, yeah.  And you sit there and go, well, now I want to see it.  You don't want it to miss and go away.  It's like watching a movie trailer and then them saying, well, you can't see the movie. 
[02:29:30]  I don't feel bad, though, because if this city was going underwater, people in New Orleans would watch, too.  Exactly.  They would, so.  People would watch if Manhattan was sinking.  Of course they would.  Everyone loved that movie where Manhattan froze the day after tomorrow.  They watched that.  It's just a lot more interesting when you don't know the people, you know?  Of course it is, and it's safer.  You just look at it a lot differently.  You don't really care much.  There's a good stretch of road right there.  Wow, there's a 20% that's actually okay.  Someone is asking, why can't they pump the water out? 
[02:30:00]  First of all, where are they getting the power from?  What are they using, a foot pump?  There's no power to power the pumps that are supposed to pump the water out.  And it's a lake.  Where are they pumping it?  Yeah.  The lake that they have, the levee broke.  You pump it back in so it can come back into the city?  From Mississippi's Gulf Coast.  They're screwed.  Fox News correspondent Steve Harrigan has a live report for us from Gulfport.  Steve?  Steve, are you there?  Okay.  I want to sound like I'm involved.  John, we're on the second floor of one house here right near the coast in Gulfport, Mississippi, 
[02:30:30]  with Sherry Trollender and her husband, Jerry, who decided to ride out the storm and who survived  to tell the tale.  Now, Sherry, when I look down and see that pile of planks and boards there, I just see  a lot of rubbish.  What is that for you out there?  That's my living room and dining room furniture that floated out with the water.  I was way sorry to say some things, but when you see a heavy sofa floating, it's an eye 
[02:31:00]  opener.  How do you feel now?  I feel very lucky that we're safe.  How do you think she feels you ask?  I look down at that pile of shit that used to be your life in the front yard.  What's going through your mind?  I feel like getting some ice cream.  I'm just really concerned about them.  And they're doing it on purpose to make us all feel, you know, oh, man.  I think I'm going to get a puppy.  Yeah, exactly.  Brian Regan, who's going to be at Caroline's as well.  Bill Burr is going to be at Caroline's all this weekend. 
[02:31:30]  Very, very funny guy.  Can't wait to see, actually, this weekend, Bill.  Uh-oh.  Looters.  Now, you've got to worry about looting in New Orleans.  Police with automatic weapons called in to patrol a grocery store.  After looters went on a rampage.  Police with automatic weapons were called to patrol the store.  After looters rampaged, ripping apart ATMs.  The pharmacy was also ransacked for obvious reasons, the drugs.  I have instructed the highway patrol and the National Guard to treat looters ruthlessly, 
[02:32:00]  said Mississippi Governor Barber.  Looting will not be tolerated, and rules of engagement will be as aggressive as the law allows.  To see their own living rooms out in the street here.  Back to you in New York.  Yeah, looks like a fire spread, huh?  Fire.  Reporting live, Steve Harrigan.  There's a guy on the roof waving a white towel, trying to get the attention of the traffic copter, guys.  Traffic copter.  Traffic copter is just getting up.  The weather is finally flyable.  And you can see there's a guy standing on his roof. 
[02:32:30]  He's saying, go away, I'm fine.  Perhaps not in great danger himself, but just trying to signal to the chaos that's going on all around him.  The house across the street's on fire.  Of course he wants help.  Yeah, and his house is going to burn down.  Yeah.  Just a couple of houses away.  Can the firefighters get there?  No.  It's absolutely impassable.  You saw that deuce and a half from the National Guard earlier.  He's pointing at the fire like people don't see it.  World War II era vehicle, but they are huge with drive axles on both rear wheels and the front axle. 
[02:33:00]  That's about the only way you can move around through some of this high water in a vehicle like that.  Helicopters are for fires out.  The fire department isn't going to be able to send those very expensive trucks into these conditions.  We have with us in our New York City studio Dr. Manny Alvarez, a Fox News medical expert.  Right now, I suppose the medical problems are not the most severe, but they're probably coming. 
[02:33:30]  Well, the health crisis that's going to occur after this disaster is going to be gigantic.  Immediately, of course, we have the emergency services.  Put Fox back on for me.  Why did you put on CNN?  There's fires.  And cuts and bruises and broken bones.  That fire is spreading in that whole neighborhood now.  Yeah, and this guy's stuck on the roof.  Who isn't in any danger, according to that guy.  No, he doesn't seem to be in any danger.  The houses are like one, two, three, just burning.  You can see the floor of the fire off the guy's chest.  Yeah, he just wants them to put that fire out before it reaches his. 
[02:34:00]  He's already burned his chest hair off.  Look, there is one, two, two more houses between him and the fire.  You're at the worst if you're watching this, and your house is not on fire, but it's next door.  Yeah.  How fucking awful is that?  You've just got to sit there and hope you're insured.  That whole house is finished.  Yeah, there's nothing they can do.  Oh, these guys aren't getting insurance money.  They'll do that lump sum where everybody gets like 30 bucks.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, oh, it's a multi-billion dollar settlement. 
[02:34:30]  Well, how much money was, oh, we've had hundreds of billions of dollars, so you get like 10.50.  Your whole life up in Flint.  That sucks.  That's it.  Let's say hi to Jerry in New Jersey.  Jerry, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Uh, it's probably better that their houses do burn for insurance purposes.  You know, you figure down there, they're not allowed to get flood insurance or hurricane  insurance because of where they're located, but you're probably going to have fire insurance  to let it burn.  I bet there's some kind of stipulation that if the fire's caused by a hurricane, you still 
[02:35:00]  don't get paid.  What do you mean, you can't get flood insurance in New Orleans?  I heard that on the news last night, yeah.  A lot of insurance companies won't insure it.  I mean, I don't blame insurance companies, but what pieces of shit these people are.  Well, I think that the emergency health services...  It is Carlos Mencia on the roof.  Carlos Mencia is on the roof of a house.  Hey, come and get me, fucker.  Okay, America, start writing your letters.  I knew you wouldn't pick up any beaners. 
[02:35:30]  There is Carlos Mencia.  You can't get flood insurance down there.  What pieces of shit the insurance companies are.  What kind of worthless life is this guy on the roof that he's there stranded, a fire approaching  him, and the news is talking about insurance costs?  Like, they don't even care about this guy.  Keep him in frame, but we don't have to talk about him.  Make sure you get a close-up of his desperation.  Yeah, just get the close-up.  You need the ratings.  Now, he didn't appear to be in any sort of danger.  No.  He's just surrounded by water. 
[02:36:00]  Water with fire coming after him.  Yeah.  All right, let's, uh, with alligators.  Surrounded his house.  No biggie.  It's an anchorman understatement.  We'll be keeping an eye on that, obviously.  Let's say how to John in Virginia.  There's a lot of fires.  Wow.  John, what's up?  Oh, hey, what's up?  Hey, man.  Hello.  Hey, Daddy.  Hey.  Hey, guys.  Hey, listen, um, dude, Elliot in the morning has been talking about y'all.  He's been mentioning you all morning.  I don't know what's up.  I don't know if he's got the word from the bosses or whatever, but, uh, 
[02:36:30]  he just, uh, trucker called up and said, uh, hey, let's, uh, dedicate Tuesday to the truckers.  Call it Petty Tuesdays.  He said, what about Wednesdays?  We call it Whip Them Out Wednesday.  And then he, uh, got, he's like, ah, don't make fun of them.  He's like, uh, we're going to be needing one of them golden tickets soon.  But that's, like, the second time.  I'm punching out.  I suck.  Oh, I think he's going to be, wait, hold on.  Was he trashing the show?  He punched out.  He couldn't, he couldn't get anything out. 
[02:37:00]  I don't think he really trashes the show.  Oh, yeah, that's good.  I try to get on to promote a gig in D.C.  And he wants nothing to do with having me on.  Yeah.  Now you want it in there.  Thanks.  You're a good egg.  Let's say hi to Steve in Houston.  Steve, what's up?  We pass.  Steve.  Oh, not much, man.  Just waiting to get back home.  Oh, Steve, you live in New Orleans?  Yeah, well, the video they keep showing from the helicopter goes over my house, and I see  the roof of my house.  Come on.  Are you serious?  Yeah. 
[02:37:30]  No.  My brother's a police officer out there, and he's telling me they can't even get to my  house.  It's got about five foot of water in it.  You sound Canadian.  That's it.  What's your, uh, dude, you live in New Orleans?  All right.  What is your zip code?  Uh, 70065.  And that accent's right.  You couldn't put such an awful accent on.  So, you're in Houston?  You got one of the hotel rooms in Houston?  Yeah, a little chinky hotel, but, uh...  They announced that there's 58,000 rooms in Houston, and all of them were taken.  Yeah, so, it's my new home. 
[02:38:00]  Uh, what town are you from in, uh, Louisiana?  Kenner.  That's right.  And we just looked up your zip code.  We all have to have flooding.  Oh, you have to have it.  All right.  We apologize for that, then.  All right.  My apologies to the insurance company.  Good.  Yeah.  You cannot live there without it.  Uh, what do you, what do you, I mean, maybe the government makes the insurance companies  give it, because if something like this happens, the government's going to get fucking raped,  so maybe they, how much does it cost?  Is it expensive?  Uh, I don't know the exact price, because, uh, my mortgage company handles it. 
[02:38:30]  Okay.  But, I think everybody pays the same price.  Okay.  That is...  Wow, the video they're now showing, because they can finally get a helicopter in the sky  over New Orleans.  Like I said, they, they're blowing off Mississippi and going back to New Orleans with their coverage.  It is unbelievable.  Yeah.  Every inch of this place is covered in water.  Dude, your house is under five feet of water?  Yeah.  So, and they try to, they can't even get to my house, because it's so deep.  Yeah, I guess you need some...  They can't get to anyone's houses, really. 
[02:39:00]  There's a guy stuck on the roof.  Oh, the Coast Guard's talking to him, right now.  Good luck, pal!  Wow, that seems a little harsh.  What were you able to do to your house before you, uh, headed off to Houston?  I didn't do nothing.  I got insurance.  Insurance.  Do you, now...  You didn't move, uh, you didn't move stuff upstairs or in the attic like Jimmy was saying?  No, I, I got insurance.  But is it stuff that you, obviously, you're not, you're not, you don't see, I'm sure you're  upset, but is it like a lot of family heirlooms, or just like shit, like, you're like an heirloom 
[02:39:30]  place?  The Hope Diamond in there.  Well, you know, sentimental shit.  I have photos of stuff I wouldn't want to lose.  That's really all I have is photos.  Yeah, I'm 29, and the only thing that, believe it or not, I'm pretty sad I didn't take with  me is my pictures that I took with you guys, so...  Jew guys.  Oh, you guys.  Well, if that's, if that's the biggest thing you lost, you really lost nothing.  I mean, I would never take another picture with you, so that, that's kind of like a memory  that's never going to come back, but I mean, I'm sure these guys would be happy to.  You know what people really have to do? 
[02:40:00]  They, they, you should scan your pictures, important photos, and, and put them, uh, on  a hard drive somewhere, like, online, somewhere away, a storage facility that you could do  that.  A lot of people, uh, don't realize once those pictures are gone, they're fucking gone.  Wait, is there a storage for something you could do that?  Yeah, you could do a insurance.  I have insurance.  That pay for the pictures?  Got the insurance.  No, if you, uh, go to, uh, there are websites, storage websites, that you can go to, where  you can then upload for a price, and they will store whatever you want to, you know, 
[02:40:30]  videos, pictures, uh, for a price, and you could store these, these pictures online.  But how, how many millibars can you put after that?  Millibars?  All right.  Now, I want to know, because I have, I have gigabytes.  I mean, all kidding aside, I know the insurance stuff's important, and the floods, but I have  a lot of gigabytes.  I'm not sure of the price, Jimmy.  I'm sure with a few clicks on your keyboard, you can get that information you'd need.  But can people hack into that and see your shit?  Who's going to, yes, I could get into the Pentagon and cause some havoc, but I want  Jimmy's pictures of Ozzy.  Not mine.  What the fuck do you think?  No, but I would love to go trolling through people's fucking photo albums. 
[02:41:00]  Like, are you kidding me?  I'm sure of.  You know how many great shots you're going to see?  A good hacker could probably do it.  How many tits and assholes and pussies and cocks and balls?  All right, Steve, good luck to you, all right?  I'm just talking about pictures of grandma.  Oh, that's true.  And her pussy and tits.  Yes, sir.  Well, Steve, go ahead.  The whack bag party, I kind of started that we were going to have a whack bag party here.  Oh, yeah, all right.  There was a whole thread about the New Orleans whack bag party.  I guess that's not going down.  That was going to happen September 3rd, I believe, right? 
[02:41:30]  Yeah, yeah, it was a friend of mine's bar.  He said we can do it and everything.  But I think it's got about 10 foot of water in it right now.  Wow.  How will you do it next year or year after?  Steve, keep in touch with us, all right, as the week goes on.  All right, see y'all later.  All right, there goes Steve.  He's in Houston.  He's waiting to get back to his house in New Orleans.  Craig, what's up?  Yeah, how you doing?  Oh, and I love your show, guys.  All right.  I wanted to clarify, you guys.  Hold on.  New Orleans mayor, 80% of the city, underwater, like Dan said, 20 feet deep in a lot of places.  Go ahead. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, listen.  What happens is these individual insurance companies don't actually provide flood coverage.  Obviously, those are exclusions.  But the national flood program are what they're going to have to go through to get their homes replaced and their insurance checks.  A lot of times, especially the commercial buildings downtown New Orleans, they'll get covered under their wind coverage.  So they'll be all right.  But a lot of people are going to get hurt.  Steam is going to step in.  There's going to be a lot of people out with the maximum coverage that the flood program gives them. 
[02:42:30]  There's a lot of devastation, as you guys know, in New Orleans, and it's going to be bad.  That's right.  A lot of checks.  You think a lot of them might have exceeded the maximum damage?  I'm sorry.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Sorry about that.  There's a mayor saying there's gas leaks throughout the city that there may not be electricity in New Orleans for six weeks.  Six weeks of no electricity.  And you're right, thousands, thousands of people will be displaced.  And I really don't know where exactly they're going to put them all.  Captain Terry Gelbreth from the U.S. Coast Guard, good luck today.  I know you've got a big, long day ahead of you.  Appreciate your time. 
[02:43:00]  Still ahead this morning with disruptions to oil production in the Gulf.  Will the White House tap the government?  Wow, they're all going with their serious looks now on the news, huh?  Yes.  It looked like New Orleans had dodged a bullet yesterday when the storm took a jog to the east.  But now, havoc, danger, destruction.  God, that stinks.  Frank in Slotsburg.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Frank.  Yesterday, about 3 o'clock, June 04 up here in New York, played your American Pie, followed up by one of the levy breaks. 
[02:43:30]  They did a levy twofer, didn't they?  Yeah, twofer.  Ugh, I hate regular radio.  People drowning, and they're doing twofers based on the hurricane.  Oh, did they really?  Q104.3 didn't like to be serious?  Yeah.  We joked about it yesterday that some rock station would play levy songs.  Yeah.  We can only think of two.  I don't know if there's a third double shot coming at you.  Or it would have been a block.  A rock block.  A rock block of levy songs, but we can only come up with two.  All right, boys, punch out.  All right.  Q104.3. 
[02:44:00]  There you have it.  That's your Sabbath.  Okay, we'll put on more pigs for you.  Airports in this region are still closed.  They include Mobile, Alabama, Gulfport, Mississippi, and, yes, again, New Orleans.  The disruption in flights comes at the worst time for the airline industry.  Several carriers already on the brink of bankruptcy, among them Northwest and Delta Airlines.  Delta is a major carrier in the hurricane-affected region.  One airline industry expert, St. Katrina, and Sky High. 
[02:44:30]  All right.  Did they get their planes out of there, though?  Both continental partners.  Because that's a – imagine if an airline had their planes there at the airport, and now they're stuck there.  They're gone.  They can't get them out.  I bet you they got –  Yeah, they probably did.  Flew them out of there.  Let's get George on the phone from Colorado.  George.  Hey, morning, boys.  Morning, George.  Hey, a buddy of mine, he lives in New Orleans, and he owns a couple of small electronic stores down there.  He came up here to Colorado to get away from the hurricane, and all of his security cameras in his house and his stores, 
[02:45:00]  we were able to access off the Internet, so we watched him lose everything.  How did you do that with the power out, though?  Well, he – until the power went out, we were able to watch it.  But, like, his house, he has a backup generator at his house, so we were able to watch it for quite a while.  Who turned the backup generator on?  It automatically kicks on when the power goes out.  How does that work?  I'm not a fucking electrician. 
[02:45:30]  I'm an electrician.  Right.  He calls up with a dramatic story, and we're, like –  Yeah, trying to catch him in a lie.  I think he's lying.  I think you're lying, sir.  I believe the guy.  Yeah.  I'm a fucking truck driver, not an electrician.  I'm calling shenanigans.  Everybody goes with the generator.  Oh, there's a generator.  Yeah, it comes on automatically.  I believe him.  Yeah, I'm not calling Bravo Sierra on this guy.  A lot of people that live in those parts of the country, if they have generators, they're wired into their homes.  We have them out here in Colorado. 
[02:46:00]  Hold on, liar.  So what happened, like, was – he had – what kind of store did he have?  He's got an electronic parts store.  Oh, shit.  So he watched for a while his stuff, like, going?  Yeah.  Now, did he lose everything, a non-truth dollar?  Fuck you, Jimmy.  Did he – was the place boarded up?  Oh, yeah.  Keep it here on Fox News Live.  That's such a liar.  We just – we watched it for a while.  His power at the stores finally went out about 11 o'clock. 
[02:46:30]  How many people were with you?  Huh?  How many people were with you?  Well, it's him and his wife and his kids were here in Colorado with us.  All right.  Thank you, George.  All right.  There he goes.  George from Colorado.  George, why don't you tell the truth?  You think so?  George is a lying sack of shit.  I don't know.  I kind of believe George.  I don't believe him at all.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  You think this is one of those fantasies you have when you walk around your house just  thinking of what to say?  Yeah.  Like, Bob Kelly does that.  Like, Bob will, like, practice what he's going to say.  Right.  And that's how you know that Bob's been practicing, because you'll say something like, 
[02:47:00]  yeah, these fucking floods.  Dude, the fucking government has got to get more money.  And then you're, like –  And ran through it already.  Yeah, because he looks up.  He doesn't acknowledge you.  He just looks up like dummy is trying to remember what he's been saying.  Remember what he's been through time again.  Yeah.  With the teleprompter in his brain.  Right.  He's trying to read it.  Dogs have heard this 80 times already.  They're, like, all right, already.  We know.  You want to be in the microphone, being important.  He has the two ugliest dogs I've ever seen in my life.  You know, like – I love his dogs.  That one looks like a – like a – like a llama. 
[02:47:30]  Like the neck chopped off and then, like, reattached.  That dirty little white one.  The Kenny G haircut.  It's fucking horrendous.  Does it have, like, crust in its eyes all the time?  White dogs, no?  Bruised.  But when Bobby, like, bombs an audition, I think he takes it out on his dog.  Don't tell me he kicks it.  Yeah.  I like Bob's dogs.  They kiss my face.  They love dogs.  They're cute.  They hop up.  When I come over, they're so happy to see me.  They lick my nose.  Oh, how nice.  Bill Burr in studio playing Caroline's this weekend.  Wait, oh.  Starting Thursday through Sunday? 
[02:48:00]  Yep.  Me and Ted Sizemore.  Yes.  I do this under the chin.  I take my finger and I cook it.  I go –  You're a little scratch.  Under the dog's chin.  You scratch him right there.  That's right.  We're going to continue with Bill Burr, but first, a word from one of our sponsors.  This weekend, for the first time in Toyota history, an unprecedented sale will change everything.  What if we told you to get any new car, truck, or SUV?  All you needed was $99 down and $99 a month. 
[02:48:30]  I'd say you were full of shit.  Well, we're not.  Get ready for the no shit sale from Toyota.  No shit.  No shit.  No shit.  Toby Hines, fearless leader at Gulf States, Toyota has gone completely apeshit and authorized  us to sell you any car, truck, or SUV for a ridiculously low $99 down and $99 a month.  No shit.  No shit.  You've got to be shitting me.  Nope.  This shit is for real.  It's the no shit sale from Toyota.  $99 down.  $99 a month.  But you better hurry because this shit won't be around forever. 
[02:49:00]  In other words, shit or get off the pot?  Exactly.  It's the no shit sale.  $99 down and $99 a month gets you any car, truck, or SUV you want.  Holy f***ing shit.  You said it.  See your Toyota dealer now.  Get the feeling.  Toyota.  $99 down payment, $99 monthly payment, not through Gulf States Toyota.  No shit sale does not apply to any existing Toyota car, truck, or SUV anywhere, anyhow,  anytime.  Not a limited time offer.  Don't see dealer for details.  Like sends through the hourglass.  So is the only name violence. 
[02:49:30]  I don't know.  You know what?  Why don't we just move right to Wang Chong?  All right.  Wang Chong.  Everybody have fun tonight.  We all remember this.  What a big fun hit this was.  Everybody have fun tonight.  For forever.  Everybody have fun tonight.  Everybody Wang Chong tonight.  Yeah.  Everybody have fun tonight.  There you go.  Have fun Wang Chong.  Everybody Wang Chong. 
[02:50:00]  What does that mean, though?  Has anyone ever figured that out?  It means having fun.  Wang Chong.  I think Wang is a euphemism for sodomize.  Uh-huh.  And Chong was maybe a retarded boy they knew in the neighborhood.  That was what I did.  Everybody Wang Chong tonight.  We're all going to Wang Chong.  Does everyone have butt sex with a retard?  Poor Chong.  I never thought of it that way.  I just want his friends to come over and hug him and talk to him.  Then he'd wind up face first crying into a Cookie Monster pillow.  What's the matter, Chong? 
[02:50:30]  They Wang me.  Oh, he doesn't know what he's talking about.  We'll Wang you.  Everybody.  And they have fun doing it.  Old Bloody Bottom.  Chong throws a punch like he takes it in the ass.  Even on vacation.  Across the nation, around the world.  Everybody Wang Chong tonight.  Some guy even drove a million miles to fuck that tempting bottom. 
[02:51:00]  Didn't even keep it a secret.  Spread the word.  Everybody Wang Chong tonight.  Oh, there's a line of cars like at the end of Field of Dreams.  Old Lady put it in his sword.  Took his.  Jesus.  He's laughing at me.  Oh, poor innocent bottom. 
[02:51:30]  Little chug.  Oh, he's just confused.  He wants friends.  Sheepish dope.  Oh, he and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  I hear the train a-comin'.  It's rollin' round the bend.  And I hear the sunshine.  I don't know when.  I'm stuck in Folsom prison.  And time keeps draggin' on.  But that train keeps a-rolin'. 
[02:52:00]  All down to San Antonio.  Dee-dee-dee-do.  And we're back.  Bill Burr sittin' in.  He's playing Carolines in New York City all weekend long.  We got a guy callin' in from New Orleans with a first-hand account.  Let's see what Ted has here.  Ted, what's up?  Hey, man.  Look, I'm in Jefferson Parish.  It's like right outside of New Orleans.  Yeah.  We left.  As soon as the wind started picking up, my dad's an electrical contractor.  So we came back as the last squall was coming out to get some of the generators back online 
[02:52:30]  for the Tulane Lakeside Hospital.  Yeah.  And we saw water out in one of the major intersections.  Dude, I've got to tell you, a lot of these guys in this subdivision, nicer houses,  they wouldn't have the five to six inches of water that they would have in there  if the city didn't pull the people.  Oh, there's a truck going by.  The guys didn't pull the people out of the pumping stations and shut them down.  Oh, is that what happened?  Dude, none of it's automated.  None of the diesel generators were backing them off.  They just turned them off. 
[02:53:00]  Because they told the guys to leave, so they shut them down and left.  Right.  And I understand.  Like, one of the pumping stations had a whole roof ripped off.  So, like, I can understand.  All right, you don't want a person in there.  But, man, this stuff, it isn't automated.  I mean, what year do we live in?  And you can't automate turbine pumps?  I heard they weren't able to handle that anyway.  Like, they would have shut down anyway.  No.  Well, if they were automated, they would have been able to monitor it.  Yeah, it's kind of archaic.  A lot of these houses, I mean, I'm not going to tell you everybody wouldn't have flooded,  but some of these houses in these nicer subdivisions, you're talking only five to six inches of water, 
[02:53:30]  which does a lot of damage, and it's irritating to you because, you know,  if you know these pumps would have been running, this water only came up after the storm passed.  Yeah, that's true.  This is coming after.  I mean, that's a storm surge coming from the other direction now, man.  But, yeah, guys, I mean, it's going to be a few weeks before we get power back on in here.  I mean, we came back here to take care of the hospitals.  The rest of my family is out in Lafayette.  I don't know where they're going to go from there.  How are you making a phone call?  Cell phone's working, dude. 
[02:54:00]  I have it said about 10, 20 times, man, but I'm on Sprint, and it's working.  Nextel, your Direct Connect works great out here.  It's about the only other thing.  Cell phones look like they started kind of kicking back online.  How are you going to charge them?  Car charger in my truck, dude.  Oh.  That's all I'm hearing you.  XM in the truck.  All right.  Well, thanks, Ted.  All right, man.  Take it easy.  Ted in another big fire.  New Orleans.  New Orleans.  New Orleans area.  Sorry for all the background noise.  I just was opening a box.  I got another gift.  Another gift.  I'll show you with a box. 
[02:54:30]  What was in the box?  What is in the box?  Oh, what's in the box?  It's really a cool gift.  Thanks, Andy, from Seattle.  He sent me a used drill because I had gotten the drill bits a while ago.  We're really starting to get some strange, strange gifts from our fans.  That is a skill drill.  This would be great to use in my apartment, though, right?  That is fine, but for your needs, though, I couldn't see you needing anything better than a cordless, though.  Yeah, this is kind of a fucking... 
[02:55:00]  Yeah, now you need a cord...  You should have a cordless drill in your house.  Now, is this good for putting things on the wall?  A cordless is even better.  Yeah, you could scare a poker with that.  That's a little bulky, a little heavy.  A little heavy.  You need an extension cord, which I'm sure you don't have.  I do.  One that's grounded.  Huh?  Let me see the prongs on that drill.  No, why would I punish it?  All right.  You want the prongs?  Yeah, no, no.  Let me see the prongs.  This is absolutely a two-pronger.  Oh, it's a two-pronger.  Of course.  Of course. 
[02:55:30]  This is nice.  Thanks for the 35-pound drill.  That is a heavy drill.  Which I can use to fucking hang my celebrity photos.  I'm going to build a deck in my apartment building, you shithead.  Anybody have anything lighter?  Like maybe a fucking bowling ball with two ledge shoes?  You're a creep, Andy.  It is a little strange, to say the least.  It's fucking weird gifs I get.  How about just some pictures of vaginas and some pornography?  All right.  We've got the latest recap from CNN about the hurricane. 
[02:56:00]  Here is the latest now on the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.  In just one state alone, Mississippi, there are an estimated 55 people dead.  And the state's governor says that death toll could be overshadowed as reports come in from just one county.  Meanwhile, the mayor of New Orleans says 80% of his city is underwater today.  And a new crisis rises by the hour.  A breached levy is dumping even more water into this besieged city.  Nearly one and a half million homes and businesses are without power from Louisiana to the Florida panhandle. 
[02:56:30]  And there are warnings that some areas are so decimated, those residents will not see power for more than a month.  How sad is this video on Fox right now?  A fire out of control and the house next to it is smoking.  Smoking.  That thing's going up.  What is setting these off, though?  Like if there's no power, what?  Gas.  Like leaking gas.  It's the generators, man.  Something happens.  Those generators kick on.  Yeah, the insurance.  The insurance.  It's a shit-covered alligator. 
[02:57:00]  Wow, that house is smoldering.  Fox is just waiting for the next house to go on fire.  They can't get enough of this.  Love the fire.  They cannot get enough of this.  All right, with this guy.  These might be old fudge.  It's the same one.  They keep sharing.  That's what they do.  That's the same guy.  That's the same video they already played.  It's Carlos Mencier again.  They trick you a little bit.  They make it look like...  It's still live, but it's not.  That's not a live shot.  They're burning down a beaner's home.  Hey, our buddy Dan Turner came up with something for us for the show.  Yeah?  Dan Turner down there in Washington. 
[02:57:30]  A huge fan of the show.  Really supports what we do.  There's somebody in Washington that supports what we do?  Wow.  There's a couple.  Yeah, no, no, I know.  There's about five or six, I think.  Yeah.  Maybe seven.  And it's obvious the ones that don't.  Yep.  Yeah, what's up with that?  I don't know.  I see a...  You've got to ask Eric Logan what's up with that one.  I already left him a message.  You did?  Good.  Of course I did.  There's a sharper image catalog that came out.  Whatever.  You know, it's got a page that features XM stuff on the page in pretty big print. 
[02:58:00]  I've seen some ads where right at the bottom in very small print they have the programming  on XM and we've been included in some of that stuff on the airplane magazines and watch  not.  But this one, pretty big print right there in the middle of the page.  I see 100% commercial free music.  I see Major League Baseball's logo.  PGA Tour logo.  Huge Bob Edwards show logo right in the middle of the page.  And then MTV and NASCAR.  And once again, thank you for omitting the Opie and Anthony show and not putting that 
[02:58:30]  on the page somewhere to let people know where we are, that we're here doing our show.  I know the reason that they would give whoever did this, because it's a personal thing and  again, whatever.  Do we have to hear the same excuse again?  Because I'm not going to buy it.  If Don Wicklund wants to call up and say, well, what happened with this and give me another  fucking excuse, I don't want to hear it because I know what the real reason is.  This is now vendetta.  This is a vendetta.  And, uh, well, we had to cover all demos. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah.  And, uh, you know, MTV is a certain demo, and we figured you guys were kind of covered by  Major League Baseball, 18 to 49, man.  Stop it.  Bob Edwards, we know, Bob Edwards and golf cover the same people.  Bob Edwards covers the, uh, vampire demo.  Dracula.  Leave the ghoul alone.  He hasn't done anything.  The Bob Nosferatu show.  The guy just, he opens his show going, welcome.  The Bob Edwards show. 
[02:59:30]  He quietly does his one-hour show every day.  He doesn't bother anyone, and we just attack him.  We don't attack him, really.  We don't mind.  Today, we will talk about A, B, or A, B blood.  What is better tasting?  Boo.  Yeah, he's doing a great show, a little feature.  How to get garlic off someone's window.  Fucking creep.  Don't mirrors just bog the shit?  Get out of you.  You can't see a thing from them. 
[03:00:00]  Boo.  His best-of show, how to trick someone to inviting you into their home.  Thank you for inviting me to your home.  Boo.  Overing around as a bat.  You know what it is?  He's just got, I mean, he's got like a creep.  I mean, he's a vampire and a ghost.  It's not enough that you're a vampire.  You also got a boo.  Well, he's very creepy. 
[03:00:30]  Boo.  I can't shit on Bob Edwards.  Van Helsing is a great producer.  That's too bad.  Yeah, well, you know.  It's a great opportunity.  I just, I don't even want to talk about the new products.  I just don't give a fuck, man.  Yeah, now it's like, go fuck yourself.  Yeah, you got this coming out?  Yuck.  That is us bashing the promotional department, I guess, for legitimate reasons, and then turning  around and going, hmm, who will we include on this page?  Ah, go fuck you.  Well, you know what it is?  It's cutting off your nose to spite your face.  Well, I don't want to get that harsh. 
[03:01:00]  You may say that.  I'm using the harsh language now.  I can't tell you how badly I want to start spitting out names with just bile attached  to it.  You know who you are.  You're fucking incompetent.  And again, we'll hear the same thing.  Well, no, they decided to do it this way or this.  No, it's it.  Stop it.  But I'm not going to dwell on it all day.  Let's say hi to Reg on Long Island.  Reg?  Yeah, what's up, fellas?  Go ahead, Reg.  Listen, man, you know, I love the show and everything. 
[03:01:30]  I've been listening forever.  Thank you, sir.  I hope he was on the Nighttime Attitude, but fucking Norton is totally pissing me off.  Why, sir?  What, sir?  He's a dick bag.  Why?  Dude, you don't appreciate shit.  That's true.  I had to send you a fucking drill?  Oh, it's that.  Hey, wait, you sent him the drill?  No.  No, no, no.  Oh.  I'm saying whoever this guy was, it wasn't me.  I wouldn't fucking send him shit.  You don't understand something.  Dude, here's what you don't get.  You do get really strange gifts, though, Reg. 
[03:02:00]  I don't fucking get.  Yo.  I don't understand.  Dude, I'll tell you.  There would be nothing without the show.  Dude, I'll tell you.  I'll tell you what you don't get.  I want a new drill.  Do you understand?  I'm an entertainer.  And if a common person wants to send me a gift to pay homage, that is acceptable.  You want to jerk me off with your common person bullshit.  But it will be a new fancy drill for a man of my caliber. 
[03:02:30]  You want me, me, plugging a cord in like you have to?  I want a cordless fancy drill, boy.  And think about how that guy feels.  He taped it a postage, shoved it in a box, sent it to your head.  Did he really?  Well, think about how I feel.  Hoping I have a new cordless gift and seeing that cumbersome cord.  Think about how a man in my position feels.  You don't deserve to sit there.  I wish Bill Burr would kick you right in the fucking teeth right now. 
[03:03:00]  Bill Burr wouldn't dare.  Bill Burr knows a fancy person when he's sitting next to one.  Yeah, stop trying to divide and conquer.  That's right, sir.  You're not smart enough to hurt my feelings.  You're with your toes with the cords on them.  I'm not dead, so I can't kick them in the mouth.  Nah, you wouldn't kick me in the mouth.  All right.  I'd kick you right in the mouth.  Nah, you wouldn't.  Fuck you and fuck your mother.  What do you think of them apples?  Oh, shit.  Fuck you.  What do you think?  That shit gets to me?  No.  I'm just saying it to you.  Well, Bill Burr kicking me in the teeth gets to me, so I'm saying fuck you.  How much was the poster done like this?  Yeah, why don't you go hang yourself with the cord on your drill? 
[03:03:30]  Wait, I want to know how much the...  Common man, hold on, union guy.  I want to know how much postage was on this thing.  I don't know, but whoever this is, it was shit, and it should have been first class overnight postage.  You don't deserve it.  Shut your fucking mouth.  You don't deserve it.  Shut your dumb Italian mouth.  I'm talking, boy.  Shut up, common person.  There's a fancy entertainer talking.  I don't know.  Where do little people put prices?  I don't even know.  I don't look at prices.  I just say, shit, and they pick it up. 
[03:04:00]  All right, Ray.  Jimmy, you're a cock.  Good one, Reg.  There you go.  You're a fucking Italian with a black man's name.  Take care, Rufus.  Let's say hi to Paul Anka.  Paul?  Besides, it's my birthday, and people want to send me gifts.  What?  The host's dead tools.  Let's say hi to Joe in Jersey.  Joe, what's up?  What's up there, fellas?  I just wanted to say, first of all, Jimmy gets cordless drills.  Second off, Bob Edwards.  When is his show on?  What channel?  I've had the unit for a year. 
[03:04:30]  I don't know anything about him.  He does a one-hour show on the NPR channel.  Yes, it's on at midnight.  Oh, the public radio channel?  Huge ratings.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I've heard of that.  And also, I don't know if you care.  There's a big concert out in Jersey this weekend, this past weekend.  One of the bands there kept giving you guys shout-outs over and over again.  A band called Therefore.  It was like O&A, Party Rock.  They were just screaming for you guys.  What's the name of the band?  Rock and Roll.  Therefore.  T-H-E-R-E, number four.  Nice.  Very good.  Thanks, brother.  Thank those guys for having me.  That drill retails for $29. 
[03:05:00]  Does it really?  $29 of that hard-earned cash.  All right, here's a new rule on the Opie and Anthony radio show.  Yes.  You're permitted to send me gifts, but they are not to be under $50.  $50.  Do you hear that?  Look, do you understand how valuable my time is?  If I'm going to open a gift, A, it will be new, B, it will be first-class postage, and 
[03:05:30]  C, it will be over $50 with a receipt in case I don't like it and want to bring it back.  Or I can have one of the interns bring it back for me and make an exchange.  I'm wearing a nice gift from one of the listeners.  Of course you are.  I don't wear gifts from the listeners.  I appreciate the gifts.  All right, back to Dan Turner, one of our big supporters down there in Washington.  Big, big supporter.  Who's Dan Turner?  Oh, my God.  He's the vice president of programming operations for XM Satellite Radio.  He wrote an email to, I guess, Steve. 
[03:06:00]  Martini Steve.  After really focusing on the Jimmy Norton phenomenal phenomenon, I put this together.  He's a whiz in the production room, this guy, Dan.  But here's a little MP3 file for you to check out.  I've put the song into Dillette under blah, blah, blah.  I sped it up like the Bananaphone song because it just sounds better that way.  Much love, Dan.  And then he writes, beyond.  So we should play the original Jim Norton phenomenal thing. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah.  That Henchman did, remember?  Yes.  Sure.  Remember this?  And then we'll play the new one by Dan Turner.  But first, here's Henchman.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Do you ever look back, and again, I know I do, when you look back on something you feel 
[03:07:00]  great about, and then you look back on it and you go, oh, what the fuck was I thinking?  Yeah, I'm still doing that.  I'm still doing that.  I'm doing seven stuff.  There's one song, who are you?  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  And you know, there's always got to be one buzzkill in life, and I've got to just really  quick address the post.  A guy named Dan Acvalante.  I want to suck a bit in his face.  He gave me a trance on a Sabbath, where Ozzy created horror with his cringe-inducing vocals. 
[03:07:30]  Ozzy sounded phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  And there you have it, from Henchman.  I hate to interrupt, but Eric tapped me during that and had plugged in the drill.  So, oh, there we are.  Riveting. 
[03:08:00]  Unplug that hunk of shit and take it out of this studio, or I'm going to fucking drill  a hole through your face.  It still has sawdust on it.  Yeah.  Did you see the cloud come out of it?  Yeah.  Hold on.  He tapped me during that bit, so let's do it twice.  Pull over.  This is going to be a big laugh-getter.  There we are.  Remove it.  Good one.  Stupid Reggie with his toolbox.  Hey, you know, the guy sends you a gift.  Shut up. 
[03:08:30]  We have the best staff in radio, I've got to tell you.  All right.  So, Dan Turner took what you just heard, and he redid it, Anthony.  All right.  So, without further ado, let's listen to what Dan Turner put together.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal. 
[03:09:00]  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal. Phenomenal. Phenomenal. 
[03:09:30]  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal. Phenomenal. Phenomenal. Phenomenal. Phenomenal. Phenomenal. 
[03:10:00]  There you have it, from Dan Turner down there in Washington.  Sounds like the banana phone a little bit.  I need to pay for that.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  That makes me sound like an ass.  It certainly does.  He got a few more phenomenal clips from you than the original one.  There's a lot of them.  Yes. 
[03:10:30]  All right.  Phenomenal.  All right, we're going to take a quick break when we get back.  That's my favorite one.  You guys want to do some golden ticket hopefuls?  Ah, we'll listen in on some other radio shows, yes.  Bill Burr sitting in.  He's playing Carolines all this weekend.  With Will, who's very funny, and Russ Maneeves.  Yeah, Russ Maneeves is great.  Russ.  I just saw Russ.  And the happy-go-lucky Russ.  You know.  Crinkles his nose.  What is it called?  With his chunk of material on rape.  Yeah.  And then smirks through the whole thing. 
[03:11:00]  He does do some brutal subjects.  All right.  We'll do this, and then we'll come back.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  You're home for good, clean, wholesome family entertainment.  Wow.  That is such a long way to go just to say.  Oh, it's the O.B. 
[03:11:30]  Oh, it's the O.B.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, Anthony.  Ha, ha, ha.  All right, let's get into some golden ticket hopefuls. 
[03:12:00]  Anthony, we're going to save four people from commercial radio.  We've already saved one radio show.  That's Ron and Fez.  They start on 202, September 12th.  Right.  Yeah, I guess Howie's doing the same thing now. 
[03:12:30]  Well, good for you.  Yeah, out of nowhere the other day.  Out of nowhere the other day, he said he was going to save five shows from terrestrial radio  and bring them to satellite.  That's a novel idea.  Yeah, of course.  From the master creator of everything and anything.  Shit, look at that.  What?  Wow, where's that?  Hurricane alert?  Oh, I don't know.  I'm looking at MSNBC and I'm looking at some guy, some guy talking to some woman.  A holiday travel.  I must have action on my television at all times. 
[03:13:00]  Floods, fires.  We're just listening to emergency managers on the only radio station that's broadcasting  emergency type things.  XM202.  They're explaining that we don't have a way to know how long we can sustain life because  they're running out of supplies and they don't know what tomorrow brings.  So they're asking anyone who can get out to get out now.  The question is, how long will that be possible?  Because as the water rises and the city of New Orleans is a bowl, they're concerned that 
[03:13:30]  there may come a time when people can't get out.  That sounds like you're talking about the end of the world.  The latest discussion that's been happening in the last few minutes is, what will we do  if the waters continue to rise?  And the latest discussion of possibilities is bringing in barges where they can create  electricity so that they can clean water so that people, so that the loss of life that's  already been experienced doesn't get worse.  They're dealing with a situation which emergency managers admit they don't know how to control  right now.  Wow, this is just going to get ugly, man.  They haven't figured it out. 
[03:14:00]  They have not figured it out.  That's a good idea.  Barges with generators on it.  You know a lot of people stayed because they always totally fucking exaggerate those storms.  Like, this is going to be unbelievable.  And you get like a sprinkle.  The news has killed people.  They absolutely killed people.  But they're overhyping.  But they're overhyping all the time.  Yeah, they probably cried wolf one too many times.  Yeah.  You're right.  Well, every time it's going to snow up here, they do that shit, right?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, go to the store.  Make sure you stock up on supplies.  There's never been a snowstorm that I've been involved with where the second it stops 
[03:14:30]  snowing, you can't go out and get stuff.  People walking out.  Old ladies are like entire turkeys.  Yeah.  Like supplies for a month.  There'd have to be 80 feet of fucking snow.  Canned goods.  Yeah, stuff you wouldn't eat if it was sunny out.  You know, like canned beets.  All of a sudden, you need that.  Yeah, you need canned goods.  Flashlights, all this shit.  Twilight Zone episode of the future after an atomic war.  That's what you need.  By 2 o'clock in the afternoon, the streets are cleared.  You're fine.  You're fine. 
[03:15:00]  We've had one bad storm in the last few years that kind of shut things down for 24 hours  in New York.  That's about it, right?  Maybe two days.  Nothing you need canned goods for.  Turkey basters.  Can't you keep your stuff cold by just leaving it outside anyway?  Buy the canned goods.  Put it in the snow.  All right.  Well.  All of the radio rips me off.  Yeah, of course, Howie.  All of the radio rips me off.  All of the radio rips me off.  Beyond AM.  Beyond FM.  It's XM Satellite Radio.  Thank you.  Thank you, Howard. 
[03:15:30]  Anyway, let's do some golden ticket stuff, okay?  A bit we started probably close to two months ago, no?  At least a month, month and a half ago, right?  Yep.  We're going to save five shows from commercial radio, yes.  We've saved the Ron and Fez show thus far.  Some of the other people we're looking at are like Brother Weez there in Rochester, BJ Shea  in Seattle, good old Scott Farrell we like.  Who else, Anthony?  Who else?  Laszlo.  Laszlo has made a pretty good impression on us, and then there's some others that were 
[03:16:00]  kind of...  The Big O and Duke show.  We like those guys.  Yeah, they are, right?  Baltimore.  We're looking for more audio from those guys, and we got some brand new hopefuls today.  Yeah, they're cool.  Yeah.  The first golden ticket hopeful is a show called The Fiasco on WJRR in Orlando, Florida.  Mm-hmm.  Here's a bit called, it's quick, Douche Smack-A-Ho.  Douche Smack-A-Ho.  Right.  All right. 
[03:16:30]  The world's most infamous ladies' man is in the hood.  What's up, bitches?  I don't like it.  It takes too long to get to the punch.  Yeah, it's a little short.  Wow.  But the ending...  No, the CD just shut off on its own, and now it re-cued.  Oh, I thought that was the way the bit went.  Let's try it again.  The world's most infamous ladies' man is in the hood.  What's up, bitches?  But this time, he's a ball...  That's great.  ...all's out pimp. 
[03:17:00]  Dimangelo, where my money at?  Hey, Douche.  There's ten, and five makes fifteen.  Fifteen dollar, bitch!  Ow!  That's all you...  It's really...  Get in for your stink ass!  Hey!  Get the f*** out, my face!  Rob Schneider.  It's really good with all the gaps in it.  What the f***, guys?  That sounds like working in the New York Comedy Club.  Like the mic goes out right on your punchline.  Really? 
[03:17:30]  Right as you get in the back.  It just cuts out.  That's great.  Well, let's clean it off on this t-shirt.  That'll work.  On that great chest.  That'll work.  Yeah, it's going to work in CD2, right, Eric?  Hawk, it better work.  The world's most infamous ladies' man is in the hood.  What's up, bitches?  But this time, he's a balls-out pimp.  Dimangelo, where my money at?  Hey, Douche.  There's ten, and five makes fifteen. 
[03:18:00]  Fifteen dollars!  Bitch!  Ow!  That's all you can get for your stank ass?  Hey!  Get the f*** out, my face!  Rob Schneider stars in Douche Smack-A-Ho, Urban Gigolo.  Ow!  Now playing in tricked-out SUVs everywhere.  Oh, good Lord!  Wow.  What do you guys think?  Subtly racist.  I like that aspect.  Subtle.  Subtly racist. 
[03:18:30]  I think that Eric's sigh of relief makes me very happy.  Oh, is he f***ing Nick Nervous for a second?  Because you said, let's get a play on number two, isn't it, Eric?  Like, I know this was your fault, sucker of cocks.  Ha ha ha!  And look at Happy Boy Hawk.  It did play lovely.  I guess I do ride him a little hard.  Oh, it's not his fault.  No wonder he's sucking mayonnaise out of the packets.  He's just trying to kill himself quickly.  Got his mayo right there.  A little hand in his boyish pocket.  Look, these guys are just sitting there just in case. 
[03:19:00]  It really doesn't mean he had a yo-yo.  Are you really going to eat that?  Yeah, dude.  It's how you reward yourself with your support.  Oh, my God.  God damn it.  He just...  So good.  An entire packet of mayo in his mouth.  All right, well, that's the fiasco.  You want to play another?  Let's give him one more shot, another bit from the fiasco.  Dude, I can't get over the fiasco.  I don't know why that bottle...  I've drank urine, and yet that offends me.  That you just ate a pack of mayo.  You know, that's just egg white or an oil crash?  Are you surviving a plane crash?  Were you surviving a plane crash? 
[03:19:30]  Why did you drink urine?  Oh.  No.  No, it's so funny.  We're like, yeah, I know.  But, like, Bill, you don't hang that much in studio.  You're shocked by that.  We're just like...  No, I knew he was...  I know, but we're like...  He peed on.  I didn't think he had guessed it.  Yeah, he drank it.  You're like rude.  He had a girl come in here and spit in his mouth.  Yeah.  But mayo.  The mayo gets him.  We're past the point of discussion on that one.  It's common.  It's common.  It works out.  And hates germs.  I drink piss.  In this case. 
[03:20:00]  Why don't we try another bit from the fiasco, just in case.  Just in case.  Maybe it was...  Maybe that was an off one.  This bit's called the, I guess, sexual harassment gnome.  Velocity Travel presents Jerome, the sexual harassment gnome.  There's the coffee machine, and here's your cubicle, Jerome.  All right, I'll leave you to it.  Have a great first day.  Superb.  It seems I'm adjacent to a gaggle of fair maidens at their sexual peak.  Dear lady, pray tell, wouldst thou like to see a magic trick? 
[03:20:30]  Are you a midget?  A little person?  I don't know what to call you.  I'm sorry.  Just call me Jerome.  Okay.  Well, what's the magic trick?  Come sit on my lap, and I'll make something disappear.  Oh, my God.  That's what she said.  You vile dwarf.  Ha!  Ooh, she likes it rough.  Delicious.  This has been Velocity Travel's sexual harassment gnome, Jerome. 
[03:21:00]  He'll never leave you alone.  Jesus.  Jerome.  That would be the, uh, Travelocity, uh...  Well, look at this, a Coast Guard helicopter guy.  Nice.  He's lowered down onto a roof.  He's got his axe.  He's just hacked through the roof, and, uh...  He decided to ride this storm out.  He's trying to get to a guy.  You know, home was the safest place to be, so they go inside the house.  Then the water starts to rise.  It's up two feet, three feet, four feet. 
[03:21:30]  Pretty soon, it's pushing you up to the ceiling, and they couldn't go outside because of the storm.  So what did they decide to do?  Uh, they decided to go into their attics, and now that video that you just saw, courtesy of the Coast Guard,  is a video of the rescues as Coast Guardsmen are literally chopping holes in the roof  to let those people get out of their attics.  All right, we're going to have more of those pictures, John, in just a moment.  In the meantime, let's go back to Caroline Shadley, as we see. 
[03:22:00]  Wow, that's unbelievable.  You did say that earlier, that a lot of these people were going into their attics with the axe.  With an axe, so they could chop their way out.  But, uh, there's a little controversy.  Travis came running in here saying that, um, our own Eric loves the fiasco.  Oh!  What's going on, Travis?  Travis?  These guys love ratting out each other, so let's see what this is all about.  Oh, there's a hatred in the ranks.  Well, no, when I brought in the CD yesterday, and I gave it to Eric, he goes,  Ooh, the fiasco!  And I just, I made a mental note in my mind to, uh, to remember that. 
[03:22:30]  How did he say it, Travis?  No, seriously.  Ooh, the fiasco!  And he made a mental note in his liver.  Of course it's in your mind.  But I made a mental note in my mind!  That's right.  And, Eric, Eric, comment?  I didn't say, ooh, the fiasco.  I said, ooh, the fiasco, because I recognized the show.  Why do you never have your own microphone?  Yeah.  You have it here just in case.  Anthony has one over there, too.  There's a mayonnaise residue in his mouth.  Yeah. 
[03:23:00]  You hear how it's off.  Eric gets with his gum and his mayo in it.  It's all just smacking in there with mayo and dentine.  Nervously holding that stupid mic, like, fucking prancing around like Sinatra.  You did say, ooh, the fiasco, didn't you?  Right.  Yeah, because I recognized the show, but I didn't say it as gay as Travis.  Wait, wait.  I want to hear...  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  No, you're right.  I want to hear him say it, Travis say it, and then I want to hear Hawk say it one right  after the other.  How you think he said it.  He said, ooh, the fiasco. 
[03:23:30]  I said, ooh, the fiasco.  One more.  Don't say, I said.  Just say, say it.  Ooh, the fiasco.  Ooh, the fiasco.  You're changing it.  That's completely different from where you really are.  It's like a bad acting class.  Ooh, the fiasco.  Meister.  Yeah.  Why would you say, ooh, the fiasco?  Ooh, the fiasco.  Ooh, the fiasco.  Rachel, you've come back.  You realize that a grown man should never say the word, ooh, the fiasco.  Ooh, anything.  Another slip of the tongue. 
[03:24:00]  Ooh, fabulous.  Slip of the tongue.  That was a slip of the tongue right onto a cock.  Who the fuck says, ooh?  Ooh, the fiasco.  Ooh, the fiasco.  Eight.  I don't care if you said it like, ooh, the fiasco.  You still said, ooh.  Here's how you should say that.  Ooh, it's so naughty.  Ooh.  That should only be said, ooh, the fiasco.  Right.  That's how you say that.  The way you said it, it's ooh, the fiasco.  Quick, put my robot in so I can enjoy it.  Wow, this guy's just hammering away with his back. 
[03:24:30]  You can't even get to the people who need help this morning.  Take a look at that shot.  It looks like there's someone reaching a hand out to this guy.  And, again, one of the Coast Guardsmen who has been dropped in there.  Pull him out.  There's plenty of room.  That must be the fat motherfucker in there.  Perhaps tens of thousands of times because from the footage we've been able to see so far,  there are thousands and thousands of homes in the New Orleans area.  Why are we looking at him and not the chopping through the rules?  It is absolutely ugly.  This is going to just get ugly. 
[03:25:00]  All right, well, the fiasco, I guess we're going to have to pass on the fiasco, huh, guys?  Attempt to give out more golden tickets.  How about this show?  The crew hawk called them a pretty cute show.  We'll move on to the next.  No, he said, ooh, it's a pretty cute show.  Ooh, the fiasco.  That's a fiasco.  We'll move on to the next golden ticket hopeful.  Well, Eric is from, I'm sorry, but Eric is from Orlando.  You're from Florida.  Shut your face.  You're from Florida, so I know you've heard the fiasco and you've enjoyed them. 
[03:25:30]  Why don't you just admit to the people that you've enjoyed the fiasco?  Yeah.  If you enjoy the show, I know one of the guys.  You know one of the guys.  You know one of the guys.  He listens to it with a big jar of mayonnaise in his lap.  Yeah.  He just scoops it with his bare hands into his mouth, giggling like a schoolgirl.  The light's out.  Jeremy comes up with a good point here.  Jeremy?  Yes, I'm going to suck cocks instead of putting your rays through.  Oh, wrong guy.  Jesus, Jeremy.  Yeah, Jimmy Norton's always felt like a frolicking queer.  He's always, oh, Opie.  Oh, Anthony. 
[03:26:00]  That's not true, dude.  Dude, when I, like, if I admire, like, Sam, I'm not, it's not being queer.  If I admire Opie's body, I'm not even being weird, but if I say Opie, like, Jesus Christ,  dude, I mean, like, that shirt, like, really fits you well.  There's nothing.  I mean, I'm not putting you down for saying it, but I'm just wanting to call you out on that  because you guys are making fun of him.  Well, I was actually, I kid around when I do that.  I go, ooh, Opie, but I'm actually kidding.  Yeah, he's mocking the whole ooh thing.  Yeah, Eric is actually really rejoicing in a show called The Fiasco because he got, he  met on the other end of a fucking cracker one time in a circle of other gentlemen happens 
[03:26:30]  to be on that program.  Hey, what has the president said about this whole thing?  What's his take on this whole thing?  It's Al-Qaeda.  It's what it is.  It's Al-Qaeda.  It's a tear.  Hurricanes don't like freedom.  Hurricanes.  Taking away our freedom.  That's what it is.  Has he said anything yet?  Of course.  This is getting really ugly.  All right.  The next hopeful, Anthony, is a show called... 
[03:27:00]  Trying to get people out.  Going to stay the course.  Hurricanes don't like freedom.  Can't pull out now.  Well, the hurricane wins.  Just go back to normal daily life.  No to water.  He really is hard to support sometimes.  Wait, we do have a clip from...  We do have a clip?  You got it all there?  All right, we got a clip.  Got the president?  Yeah, because I want to know what he's saying about this whole thing.  Because this is a true mess.  This was a terrible storm.  It's a storm that hit with a lot of ferocity. 
[03:27:30]  Hilo.  It's a storm now that is moving through, and now it's the time for governments to help  people get their feet on the ground.  I want the people to know in the affected areas that the federal government, the state government,  the local governments will work side by side to do all we can to help  get your lives back in order.  We're in place.  We've got equipment in place, supplies in place, and once we're able to assess the  damage, we'll be able to move in and help those good folks in the affected areas.  You talking about Iraq?  Yeah.  Halliburton's going to come down to New Orleans.  All right.  I'm going to help yous out.  He raised a good point, though, because he did say that it was a bad storm. 
[03:28:00]  Terrible.  Which I wasn't really too sure.  Yeah.  When he says it, now you know it is.  All right.  Let's go back to the Golden Ticket Hopefuls.

[03:31:30]  They're promoting it like  It's their own  With no mention of you guys  Just  I don't want to give you a heads up on that  Yeah, that one was  Taken by a ton of radio stations  Do you have their website, Hawk?  Yeah, there's no WOW  There's no WOW thing on there right now?  They took it off  Well, now with the, you know, the new cleaner version of commercial radio  Maybe they were told to stop doing our bit  It's possible  They used to hang out at strip clubs and shit like that  And do the whole WOW promotion, so  Alright, thank you, sir  Thanks, guys 
[03:32:00]  Bye, mister  Let's go to Tom in New Orleans  Alright  Tom  What's up, boys?  You finally got cell service, huh?  No, I'm on a hard line  The hard line never went out  Real?  Where are you?  I can't dial out  I'm still at my mom's house  The water just, after it stopped fucking raining  It just kept coming up  Really?  Yeah, it's finally going down a little bit  It came right to the front door  Did your, like  Did the place flood at all or it didn't get inside?  No, no, no, no  My house might have, but hers didn't  And the street looks like a swamp, dude 
[03:32:30]  There are snakes and bugs and shit  It's hot  We're running out of beer  We're running out of beer  This blows, man  The ocean's not going to have power for a month  I can't even get out of here  Yeah, how's your family doing?  They're all fine  Yeah  They're not back here  Right  I mean, riding it out  The storm was nothing  The storm was nothing  Catastrophic as the aftermath, dude  So now it's all flooding, yeah  They had generators, but they weren't automated  So they had nobody to get in there and pump them 
[03:33:00]  They didn't turn them on until, like, 10 o'clock last night  And when I tell you it finally went down  The water went down maybe three inches between  In 12 hours  It's supposed to go down an inch an hour  What part are you actually in?  In Jenner  Yeah?  Jefferson, Paris  The one that was most devastated  But you say the water is draining out of there  Barely  But there are places where the water's still coming up  In the French Quarter and stuff  Yeah  New Orleans pumps  And they've still got all the brothers in the Superdome  We're trying to riot  They're trying to riot 
[03:33:30]  Let us out now  So they can go loot, I guess  I don't know  Oh, John  Hey, Tom, is the  Do you think the Royal Sinesta is flooded or no?  Part of it  Well, they say  The Royal Sinesta is a pretty tough building  I doubt it  I mean, if it is flooded  It might just have maybe, you know  Half a foot or two foot of water  And they can go up to the second or third floor  But the Hyatt, the big hotel next to the dome  Yeah  Did you see pictures of that?  Every window  Yeah  Is blown out  It looks like the federal building in Oklahoma 
[03:34:00]  Now, how have you seen that if your power's out?  I got a battery-operated TV  We lose batteries  We need 10 C batteries  Have them heliport some stuff into me  And then we turn it off for about five hours  And we can get it back for about 20 minutes  Wow  They got one station  And they're broadcasting from Baton Rouge  The big station  So their home office down here is flooded out  So you got some news for a few minutes at a time  And then I got the radio  I can put on the news talk station  But every time you put it on  It's like just depressing, man 
[03:34:30]  It's like business won't be back to normal for a month  You won't have power for a month  They're not letting people even in the parish  Until Labor Day  Which is Monday at  Well, they're also saying  Martial law has been declared in New Orleans  Yeah, Jefferson Parish  What's that mean, martial law?  Martial law means  In other words, I'm trying to get to my house  To get some more supplies  Yeah  And it's not very far  But you got to trek through like  Maybe about two blocks  Full of maybe two foot  Foot and a half of water  Probably two foot of water 
[03:35:00]  Yeah  And then if the cops see you  I'll just tell them  Look, man, I need some  Meditation or something  Yeah, martial law is when  Can't leave  The National Guard kind of takes over  They can shoot you  Some of your normal rights  Aren't there anymore  Yeah, they could shoot you for looting  Yep  They're going to pile you up naked  Yeah  Like a little pyramid  I'm just dying to see  You wear a hood  What's left?  Put you on a leash  Left of my house, man  So your house is in a shitty area?  No, no  My mom's actually house 
[03:35:30]  Is a nicer house  But she gets more water on the street than me  And I'm further away from the lake  About like two blocks further away  I don't mean shitty bad  I mean like where the place got hit  It was in a bad area for a storm  Yeah  Yeah  Well, his area is not as bad  As what we're seeing on TV  We're seeing water up to the roofs  No, no, no, no, no, no, no  Not as bad there  But they got places in North Canada  Like if I went two blocks the other way  Going away from my house  Toward the lake  Yeah  Then they got  Some people have like four feet of water  In their house  Tom, how much beer do you have left? 
[03:36:00]  How much beer do I have left?  Yeah  Not a lot, dude  I'm rationing it  Six pack?  Maybe about close to a twelve  But the good thing is  My stepfather has a boatload of whiskey  But ice is running out, dude  Yeah, what do you do now?  You got to drink warm beer, huh?  Well, no  I'm going to kill the beer before it gets  You have to drink warm whiskey  And then water is out of wrath  We got more whiskey than we do water  How's the toilet?  Is it working?  Is it flushing?  No, you got to put  You got to take shits in the backyard  You got to take a shit in the backyard 
[03:36:30]  Because your toilet won't flush  Yeah  One of my buddies took a goddamn shit in the toilet  And we're still trying to flush that  Man, you got floaters  That guy's sorry  Yeah, sorry  Broken stupor  I'm sorry  So you're just leaving logs in the backyard?  Well, we got three dogs, too, man  We got logs everywhere  No, that's the least of our troubles  Ramone  Trust me  That can't be healthy  That's the least of our troubles  I know, it's going to be floating around the street  Because everyone's shitting in their yards 
[03:37:00]  That's just going to be thousands of human dumps all over the place  The thing is, there's nobody here, man  This is like a big neighborhood  And we haven't seen anybody  Like, if we really  I mean, we could be stuck here for  Well, if the water goes down  We're going to do something  You got any military presence in the streets?  No  Why don't you shit in your neighbor's yard?  Yeah, really?  They're not there  Dude, why don't you go into your neighbor's house and grab some stuff?  Yeah, you can't really do that  Nah, you can't  There's no one there  No one's going to see you  You need water, Tom  If they have some beer, maybe  Maybe just check the fridge 
[03:37:30]  You're not talking about diamonds or nothing  No  Maybe a beer or two  I'd leave him a 20 spot, too  There you go  There you go  Give me a favor, stop rehearsing  You're confronting the National Guard speech to us  Would it be great if he got shot on sight?  Oh, God  In his own place  That would make me happy  Just going to his own place for some liquor  That's fantastic  It sucks, man  I tell you what  The aftermath is what's going to kill us  So now it's like  It doesn't really matter what time, what day  It's just hot  Yeah 
[03:38:00]  Yeah, can you imagine?  It's just hot  At least you got the A.C., right?  No  Nothing  Do you see any fires in your area?  No  No, I saw the shit you saw, I guess, on TV  That one dude on the roof waving and pointing at the fire  Yeah  Carlos  That sucks, dude  All right, well, Tom  Keep us posted  I'll check in tomorrow, boys  I didn't even know I was going to be able to get through  I couldn't get through to Ben's cell  And then I saw this number where y'all had called back yesterday  Yeah, use this one  Because Ben's always on the phone  Yeah  You know, but dude 
[03:38:30]  It's pretty bad, man  The thing is  You just can't get anywhere  You've got to ration the water  I mean, the only thing we've got a lot of is whiskey  So I guess we'll just get tanked  And sweat  At least you know you won't be wasting any, like, water  You know, like, you know  Doing, like, toothpaste type things  So at least you don't want to waste  No, I did  I brushed my teeth this morning, dude  Oh, cool  It did  Get that funk out of your mouth  You've got to use a little bit of water  Well, good luck, man  We were thinking about you  All right, boys  I'll check in tomorrow  All right, Tom  Send some beer this way 
[03:39:00]  We'll try to get a care package  Care package  I need beer and ice  That's it, dude  I'm good  I can live what I want  All right  Bye, Tom  All right, later  Here goes Tom  Boy, he's roughing it out  Wow  He actually sounds more coherent there  Than he has in the year  Oh, yeah  I'm talking to him  Absolutely  Well, he's, I guess, one of the people, strangely enough, in the areas that were lucky  Good  You know, he said it came up to his Doha, but didn't flood the house, and now it's receding, so 
[03:39:30]  Came up to the Doha, and then, of course, he had to have his obligatory racist remark about the black people in the Superdome rioting  Are they right? No  I don't know  I would guess they're probably getting a little agitated  Dude, if you were in that thing, and it was just a reeking of shit  Reeking of feces  I think that's why they want to get out  You'd say, let me out, it's my right to walk the streets if I want to  But they're going to say, no, martial law, you can't  There's nowhere to go  Where are they going to go?  They let them all out  Their houses are underwater  They can't go back there 
[03:40:00]  Other shelters, where are they?  Those are packed  There's nowhere to get out of the city to leave to go to relatives that are elsewhere  Yeah, but there's an area when you walk into the Superdome where you walk upstairs  It's almost like a porch  Yeah, so they're going to sit there  I would go stand out there  Rather than sitting there smelling  Just stinking  No one brushing their teeth because there's no water  No, there's nothing they can do for hygiene  It's absolutely amazing  A bunch of raw armpits smell  Keith, Jersey, what's up?
