<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts defiantly rejecting pressure for radio to be “nice,” immediately setting a tone of irreverence. They then recounted their new boss’s unusual arrival, disheveled and uncertain about her attire.  A substantial portion of the show was devoted to the 2008 US Presidential primaries, specifically the Obama-Clinton race. The hosts expressed skepticism about the superdelegate system, criticized the media's focus on Obama's personality over policy, and debated voter understanding of candidates' platforms.  Their discussion included commentary on previous presidents, Bush and Carter.  A humorous anecdote about Jim Norton forgetting his car after a date was shared, followed by the announcement of plans to play an embarrassing old tape of Norton's early work.  They previewed segments including an interview with a Sports Illustrated swimsuit model, and phone calls from Bob Saget and Patrice O'Neal.  The recurring segment “Whip Them Out Wednesday,” involving listeners displaying “WOW” stickers on their cars, was also discussed, along with its related website, “thewebsitewecantpromote.com”. A lengthy discussion ensued regarding a video of a police officer and a skateboarder, with callers weighing in on who was more at fault. This spurred conversation about parenting, discipline, and respect for authority.  Several guests were mentioned or present: Jim Norton, Rich Voss, Bob Kelly, and Patrice O'Neal.

The show continued with a segment featuring a 1996 clip of Jim Norton’s first television appearance on Conan O’Brien’s show. The hosts mocked Norton’s nervous performance, contrasting his early “happy to be here” style with his later, more cynical persona.  Patrice O'Neal, in flamboyant attire, was a guest in studio, prompting ribbing from the hosts.  Bob Saget called in, with a caller contributing an anecdote about Saget's unpleasant Christmas gift suggestions.  The upcoming Sports Illustrated swimsuit model guest was again mentioned.  A video of a police officer throwing a paraplegic man from his wheelchair was discussed, with the hosts promising to post it online.  An “Oscar Moments” segment featuring *Michael Clayton* was also included.  The hosts and guests engaged in comedic bits, impersonations, and observational humor. The show then teased a comedic scene involving Rich Voss and another host, emphasizing the contrast between Voss’s nervousness and the hosts’ mockery of his acting.

A Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model, Daniela Sariba, appeared as a guest.  The hosts engaged in crude and sexually suggestive banter with her, including a prolonged exchange in broken Portuguese. The conversation covered her modeling career, Rio de Janeiro (favoring discussion of favelas and nightclubs), and her recent marriage.  A comedic acting segment featured Rich Vos struggling with a cold read from *A Bronx Tale*, directed by guest Chaz Palminteri.  The hosts created a deliberately awkward setup, highlighting Voss’s discomfort. The segment promoted Palminteri's one-man show.  The show concluded with plugs for the guests’ projects and a discussion about Roger Clemens and steroid use in baseball.  The hosts frequently used vulgar language and made numerous sexually suggestive remarks throughout this segment.

A discussion about a contentious wedding, stemming from the hosts' feeling slighted by a friend's multiple receptions, dominated the next segment. This devolved into a critique of their friendships, highlighting infrequent communication and lack of mutual support, exemplified by a $200 wedding gift incident.  Patrice O'Neal, Jim Norton, Bob Kelly, and Rich Voss were in studio, with Bob Saget calling in later.  The conversation shifted to the presidential election, with highly offensive and racially charged language used regarding Obama and McCain.  Healthcare, taxation, and the candidates' suitability were discussed.  Saget’s appearance focused mainly on his TV work. The conversation concluded with reflections on the American political system, racial dynamics, and the lack of genuine friendship among the hosts and their peers. The hosts discussed how their careers provided experiences they might not have otherwise had.

The final segment heavily featured the 2008 presidential election, specifically Obama's candidacy.  Racially charged jokes and commentary about Black people, Obama, Al Sharpton, and Jesse Jackson were prevalent.  The hosts and a caller engaged in this offensive dialogue, exploring anxieties about a Black president from a white perspective. This was interwoven with racial stereotypes and jokes, political commentary (with strong language and partisan viewpoints, heavily criticizing Bush's presidency), audio from Jim Norton's stand-up routine (analyzed for its awkwardness), a tirade against Roger Clemens and Brian McNamee (using offensive language), personal anecdotes (including a discussion of a weight chart), and further commentary on Jim Norton’s first television appearance. Extended riffing on Norton’s comedic style and awkwardness was featured.  The show concluded with a “line of the day” segment and plugs for various comedians and events.

The broadcast ended with a contentious but humorous exchange between the hosts and Rich Voss about his golfing handicap, which the hosts mocked, alleging cheating. Voss defended himself, citing injuries.  Greg Hughes, the actor portraying Opie in "The Opian Anthem," was also present, participating in the ribbing of Voss. The banter became increasingly vulgar and personal, with frequent profanity and insults.  The hosts discussed Voss's previous on-air humiliations. The show concluded with insults and banter, ending abruptly.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  The girl gives you a strip club advice, and then you go and see Little Mermaid the next day.  It's not like I went with a gay guy.  Your girlfriend did, it was you.  Did you learn a payment is going?  I think if you were touched inappropriately, it would make it like a quick pop song, like  the Beatles used to do. 
[00:01:00]  The love, love, me, don't.  Yeah.  They're like, shit, freeze!  Tell us what happened.  I had a patient who was a college student and was really, really depressed, and he killed  himself.  It's time for people to understand, these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Oh my God, our new boss just staggered in here. 
[00:01:30]  Is she all right?  What?  Thumbs up?  Steve, you know her?  Yes, we go way back.  You go way back with the new boss?  I go way back.  We go way back.  Thank you, Anthony.  Yes.  We worked together at, what was it called when I was there?  The Blink Fresh thing.  I forgot you worked for that Blink crap.  Blink Fresh Mix 1027.  Yes.  With the pink logo.  Mix Blink Fresh.  Mix Blink Blink.  Yeah, when we got fired at WNEW here in New York, they had to change formats and they 
[00:02:00]  went for this weird thing.  Entertainment Radio.  A thing?  It was called Entertainment Radio.  Well, it was, the idea was Access Hollywood and Entertainment Tonight on the radio 24-7.  Keep in mind, Access Hollywood and Entertainment Tonight can't do 22 minutes a day with video,  but we were going to do it with radio.  24 hours a day.  24 hours a day.  Basically.  And no one understood it.  Yeah.  I hear she's great.  She's very nice.  Everyone talks very highly of her, but all I have to say is the observation was a little 
[00:02:30]  weird.  She kind of staggered in here.  Her hair was a mess.  And she asked Anthony, am I dressed?  Didn't she say that?  Well, she's not used to mornings.  She goes, oh my God, I'm used to afternoons.  This morning stuff is rough.  And then she goes, I'm dressed, right?  She wasn't even sure she was dressed.  She missed the new boss, Jimmy.  Oh.  She's actually cool.  She's very cool.  The first impression, you know, she came in here staggering around, meeting everybody  was a little strange, but. 
[00:03:00]  Oh, half dressed?  No.  She wasn't sure if she was dressed.  I like a woman who doesn't know what state of dress she's in here.  She actually has a great sense of humor.  She's a lot of fun.  We'll see what happens.  We're pumped.  We got a boss finally here in New York City.  Here it is.  It's official.  Yeah, absolutely.  All right.  Where do we begin today?  Jimmy, you all right?  I'm, uh, yeah, I gotta get my, I'm having my car got.  I went out last night and, uh.  You're having your car got?  I know I'm not saying this right.  Oh, okay. 
[00:03:30]  I went out last night, uh, to do a spot at the comedy store and me and my girl were gonna  go eat.  But I couldn't get my car because I left it by the cellar because it was police activity.  There was fire trucks.  Wow.  So we go to, uh, the restaurant and, uh, she goes home and I'm taking a cab back to get  my car.  But I forgot.  And I just went home.  So I walk in my apartment last night and I took out my car keys.  I'm like, ugh, it's a sheet of ice so I can't go back out and go back down to the  village.  Wait, you forgot your car?  Dude, it was a ticket again.  The hell you.  I forgot my car.  I, I, I can understand doing that but not. 
[00:04:00]  Not Jim Norton.  Being sober.  Yeah, right, right.  Completely sober.  I, I, I, when I pull those stupid car keys out, I just immediately, I didn't know why  but I'm like, this should not be coming out of your pocket.  Oh, no.  Oh, yeah.  They're still in the village of your car, idiot.  So I have to have it moved before.  Is, uh, Kenny on the case?  I think we're going to send somebody.  I'll get it.  No, Kenny's going to get it.  He doesn't trust anybody with Jim Norton's car.  I couldn't believe I did that, though.  It was after midnight, so I just, I was like, I'm going to go to bed.  I can't go back out. 
[00:04:30]  Oh, that is weird.  That is weird.  Oh, it was, I was like, that's what it's like to drink again.  Like, you forget.  You didn't even think that you had your car.  I had.  You've never seen a more leisurely cab ride.  All happy that you're in the cab going home.  Oh, snug as a bug in a rug.  All warm and not wet anymore.  It was lovely.  So where was your, you know, attention that you forgot your car?  Like, you were just in love?  We went out to, uh, yeah, I mean, we had a nice time for dinner.  And, uh, I was just like, all right, just text you when you get upstairs so I know you're  okay.  And, uh, then I just got in the car and was just sitting there and didn't realize that I 
[00:05:00]  forgot mine.  I've never done that in my life.  I, I understand.  All right, phone number 877-212-O-N-A, uh, Obama with a huge, huge win.  Wow.  Once again, right?  Wow.  Yeah, this, uh, Obama storm is, uh, is just not stopping.  Is it a storm?  Is that what it is?  Uh, well, I said it was a Bruin.  Now it's a, it's just a full-fledged storm.  He's sweeping the nation.  Well, they, and, uh.  But they said this isn't going to be decided anytime soon, which I don't get because the Obama 
[00:05:30]  train is just winning everything at this point.  It's the superdelegates, Opie.  See, once the superdelegates chime in, uh, that's supposed to be Hillary's, a strong,  uh, point where, where she, uh, rallies.  Really?  And Obama's actually starting to bash the whole superdelegate, uh, ideology and, and that whole  thing.  And, and rightly so, because that's, that could put them under.  What is a superdelegate?  Yeah. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, a superdelegate is a superdelegate.  You know what's funny?  I, I watched three news programs and they were trying to explain the superdelegate.  I don't know still.  Everyone's trying to figure out what the superdelegate is.  I read so much on superdelegates and, again, I have no idea.  It's, it's very important delegates.  There, it's, it's some kind of very old system that was put in place after, um, the, uh, McGovern  election, uh, to guarantee that, um, the, the, the party's best interests are, are seen. 
[00:06:30]  It, uh, I don't get it.  I read so many things on it, trying to understand it.  And I felt like a, a, a retard looking at calculus.  Is it, uh, another safeguard to take the voting out of our hands?  Good.  Right.  Yeah.  Because they don't really want us voting for the president of the United States of America.  It looks good.  No.  You know, you, you definitely go and you could cast a vote, but they got all these safeguards  in place that, uh, especially before it even gets to the point of the election, it's, it's 
[00:07:00]  completely taken out of our hands.  It's, why, why is it whittled down to the two people before it goes into the real people's  hands?  And I know you could talk about the independent candidates and everything, but the fact of  the matter is it's a two party system.  You have your two candidates that are your big stars that everyone votes for, and it's  been completely taken out of the people's hands up until that point.  And it's still not in our hands even after that point, but it gives more of an illusion 
[00:07:30]  that, uh, we're in charge and we're casting our vote.  Nah.  It's almost like the, uh, bull fight where the bull gets just decimated before it actually  goes to the, uh, Toreador.  Yeah.  You know, it's like it just spears in him and swords in his neck.  And that's pretty much what it is now.  All right, people go ahead.  Now it's time to fight the bull.  What happened?  Yeah.  I mean, it's, they don't want us voting for the president.  I mean, if you're a Republican in New York state, let's say. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  Let's stay home when it's time to vote.  Yeah.  Cause New York state is going to go to the democratic candidate.  No matter what.  There's only a vote.  It really doesn't matter.  I was, uh, I was watching it.  I forgot who last night.  And they basically what the election comes down to in the end.  I forgot who.  Yeah.  Well, cause they're all the same.  Yeah.  Hannity's, you know, stands out a bit, but for the most part, they're all the same.  Uh, but it comes down to just a few states that are swing states.  And that's, that's how the election is going to be either won or lost. 
[00:08:30]  Uh-huh.  But if you're a Republican and you live in New York, your vote is a waste of time.  It really is.  I mean, you feel like an American, I'm voting, but the Democrats have already won New York  state.  Yep.  In the upcoming presidential, uh, race.  Yeah.  They always, uh, take it and you'll hear, and New York state has gone to, uh, the Democrats.  And of course, okay, uh, so what happened?  I voted and it was nothing.  Right.  It was for naught.  Yeah.  And most of the states are like that, except for a few swing states that could go either  way every election. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  And those are the ones they focus on and that's it.  So the rest of us are kind of screwed.  It just doesn't matter.  Um, I'm seeing a lot of articles coming out about Obama and it has nothing to do with  his platforms, how he's going to accomplish these promises he's making.  It's all about this.  Uh, and I've said it before, the cult of personality.  Of Obama.  Sure.  Their, their article after article is coming out about how women are flocking to his speeches,  uh, crying, screaming, snapping pictures, trying to get close to him, going home and describing 
[00:09:30]  their encounter with him as something almost religious.  And no one knows what the hell this guy stands for or how he's going to accomplish some of what  he says.  He wants the troops pulled out of Iraq, um, pretty much immediately.  Uh, his healthcare system he wants implemented, uh, immediately and all these things, there's  no real plan behind it. 
[00:10:00]  Well, the question I have, he's no different than any other candidate.  That's just it.  I, I understand that people voted for Bush.  They had no idea what he was about.  Most people.  Well, they knew he was a tough on crime guy.  I think they, they're focusing more on what is Obama about because he's black, but, but  no one knows what these politicians are about.  The majority of people don't know what these candidates stand for, uh, as they're voting  for him.  That's, that's just the fact.  Uh, they're, they're voting on racial lines.  Not really.  Uh, oh no, no, they are. 
[00:10:30]  They are.  A lot of, he won.  I mean, the black people are voting on racial lines.  Oh, sure.  They, they are not really looking into his background and, uh, he really doesn't have  much of a background in politics.  Uh, it's, it's the fact that, you know, he's, he's a black guy and they want to vote  for him.  But, and I, I gotta defend him.  No one looks into their candidate before they vote.  And I'm, when I mean no one, I'm, I'm talking about the majority.  I mean, certainly there's a bunch of people listening right now that they, they do look at  their candidates.  That's a problem.  But at least, uh, if you have a guy and, and this might, I'm not saying this is a good 
[00:11:00]  thing.  This could be a very bad thing.  It could be great that, uh, you know, Obama's this new guy and, and maybe he'll change things  around.  Who the hell knows?  But the majority of the candidates up until now, you know where they stand based on their  record because they have this long record.  That's a good point.  Of, uh, of voting in, uh, policy and, uh, you, you kind of know what they stand for.  If they're a conservative Republican, you know what they're going to stand for on certain 
[00:11:30]  issues.  If they're a liberal Democrat, you know where they're standing.  Uh, I don't know.  Obama, I don't think there's enough.  And they always bring up the experience things.  I don't want to sound like a, you know, I've just been reading the paper.  Hey, they call him, uh, inexperienced.  So I will the fact of the matter is he, he is, uh, again, I don't know if that's a bad  thing.  I think it might be kind of good to shake things up.  I think it's a good thing in this case.  Cause it's the same old, same old for so many freak terms in, in, in Washington.  This guy's exciting. 
[00:12:00]  He's exciting, Anthony.  You know what?  The same old, same old has kept this country at the forefront, uh, for a couple of hundred  years and more.  We're kind of paying for it right now.  Are we?  We got a lot of people with mortgages.  They don't know how they're going to pay for them.  You know, the economy's not looking too good.  Radio stocks suck.  What?  That's good.  That's very cyclical.  It always has been.  You could look back in history and see presidents that have suffered because of the economy and 
[00:12:30]  it had nothing to do with what they're doing.  Uh, this war is what I like to call a boondoggle.  It's just costing a lot of money, uh, which could, I guess, better be used elsewhere because  I really could give a crap if the Iraqi people are free or not.  Uh, it's not what we got into that one for and we were bamboozled by it.  They don't care either, actually.  No, they don't either.  Let them do their thing.  And, uh, all, all we have to worry about is, uh, if they're going to get a new, a nuke 
[00:13:00]  or not.  That's all.  If there's a whole job, look at these countries, let them do their thing and make sure they don't  get a nuke.  That's all we care about.  I, I've heard about, uh, from Obama, Hillary, even, uh, talking about how they're going  to pull the troops out of Iraq, but sit down and tell me your exit strategy besides just  loading up logistically.  It's not time for that.  It's insane to think you could take that amount of soldiers and equipment that have been  entrenched there for years. 
[00:13:30]  For longer than we were involved in World War II.  Sure.  And just move them out like you're helping a friend move out of his apartment.  I understand that.  But the candidates, it's not their job to get into specifics.  They, they talk, they talk in broad strokes right now.  Well, they all do it.  You know something?  That's what I don't like at all.  I'm not necessarily, uh, defending Obama.  I do like the guy.  You sound like Regis.  I'm, I, but I'm lumping them.  Yeah.  But I'm lumping them all together.  They, they, they're doing, all of them do exactly what you're saying.  Yeah.  You know, when, when we finally get two candidates and then they start, uh, debating, then, then 
[00:14:00]  they, they can't talk in broad strokes anymore.  Now they're going to have to get into some of the specifics of, of what they have planned  when they get into the office.  Isn't that a little late though?  I mean, I'd like to know what some of these guys' details are before we're down to the  two people that are, uh, I completely agree with you.  Up for grabs.  But the problem is this is how it's always been.  Yeah.  For some reason you want specifics now, but you, you didn't have specifics when, uh, when  Bush was running and all the rest of them go all the way back to Reagan. 
[00:14:30]  I think Reagan gave some specifics as far as what he was going to do.  He talked about a lot of, uh, programs that were going to be cut and maybe after he got  the nomination, but I, I kind of remember even back then people like, wow, there's  actors running for the presidency.  It's an actor.  That's all I know.  Well, it's broad stroke crap.  Yeah.  I mean, I, I actually agree with you.  I mean, I think it's kind of scary that most of us, once again, will vote and we don't  know much about the guy. 
[00:15:00]  We just have a feeling.  We're like, wow, this Obama, he's very energetic.  So I got to vote for him or, uh, this Obama, I can't vote for him cause he's black.  It's just basic.  I mean, we, we go on the streets and, uh, and, and that's what we're hearing from the  people that we don't know.  They don't know.  And people don't know.  And that's kind of a, an odd thing to me that he's got, and it's that he's got so  much, uh, so many people behind him and, and treating him like a rock star.  That's the frightening part because it's not based on what he can do as president of the 
[00:15:30]  United States.  It's based on the fact that they like him like you like a rock star, a movie star, things  like that.  The young women are just, uh, all over him.  They love him.  Let me ask.  And it's just, uh, let me ask you this, Ant.  Do you think that, uh, Bush was a good president?  Uh, at the beginning I had my hopes.  That's for sure.  Um, I think he just mishandled a lot of things. 
[00:16:00]  It was, uh, I think he was surrounded by a lot of really, really smart people and the  country didn't fall apart with Bush in office and the same thing's going to happen no matter  who's in there.  It really is.  You think?  Absolutely.  Obama, because of the lack of experience, I'm thinking will probably surround himself  with some, some, some heavy hitter.  Let me tell you something that wasn't business as usual that really cost us.  Yeah.  Uh, Jimmy Carter.  Now, now you could say things are all the same.  Jimmy Carter got in there. 
[00:16:30]  He was a very weak, uh, president in a time where we needed a very strong president because  of, uh, we're in the middle of the cold war.  Uh, the middle East, uh, was really kicking up and this guy really had no clue how to handle  that situation.  Absolutely.  He, he is a Georgia peanut farmer that really had no experience in foreign policy and it  showed and it took Ronald Reagan to get in there and scare the crap out of the Soviets 
[00:17:00]  and, and, uh, a lot of other, uh, countries into, uh, respecting the power, uh, that was  the United States, especially back then.  That's a situation where you could go, everything's the same.  All these guys are the same, but it wasn't, it hurt the country horribly.  I agree with you.  Uh, Carter almost destroyed this country, destroyed the nation for God's sake.  He decimated the military.  Thank God for Reagan, man.  Thank God.  One pro Carter point, even though I don't like him. 
[00:17:30]  He can't blame him for necessarily what happened in Iran.  He, he, we gave sanctions to the Shah because, uh, he was an ally.  Yeah.  He was coming here and the radicals took over and wanted to.  But he wasn't a strong president.  He, he didn't do any saber rattling.  It was all about, all about diplomacy with him.  And, and I can understand diplomacy being used as part of it, but you have to back that  crap up with some hardware and some harsh words.  As someone said, speak softly, but carry a big stick. 
[00:18:00]  Teddy Roosevelt, my friend.  Sure.  That wasn't Buford Pusser.  Buford Pusser.  That's what it was.  Damn.  Walking tall.  I always forget that.  Love that movie.  Well.  Buford Pusser.  I'll tell you this much.  Cute name.  I'll tell you this much.  This Obama's got everyone talking because if he, well, if he wasn't in this, uh, in this  race, we same old, same old, we wouldn't be excited about the white stripes.  We wouldn't be excited about McCain.  Well, he's got everyone talking, but he's got everyone talking about, we don't talk about 
[00:18:30]  politics on this radio show for the most part.  No.  We're, we're, we're, we're all in on this one.  We're really, really, uh, following this and, and, uh, showing a, a big time interest.  Let me tell you another guy that had, uh, uh, people interested in politics.  Taft.  Probably about, uh, maybe the mid thirties.  This gentleman came along in a country that, uh, wanted change.  I'm turning your mic off.  That wanted change.  That man was Mitch Kumpstein. 
[00:19:00]  Thank you, man.  All right, listen, we're just getting started.  We got a really, really busy day.  We got all the boys coming in today.  Busy.  Because sometime this morning, we're going to look at, uh, Jim Norton's first.  Oh.  That's today?  Yes.  All right.  As opposed to good?  As opposed to good.  Jimmy gave us a tape that's about 10 or 11 years old.  And we're going to be, uh, watching it today.  And, well, listening, listening to it and having some fun with that. 
[00:19:30]  I've watched maybe the first minute of it with my girlfriend.  I couldn't get beyond it.  Were you just freaking out?  It was, it was humiliating.  Humiliating.  That's the word.  Yeah.  Humiliating.  Yeah.  So we like to do this from time to time.  We, we try to like bring in some really old tapes that just will be embarrassing for  the, for the person.  We were in the barrel, what, two weeks ago.  It's Jimmy's, Jimmy's, uh, turn today.  And then we'll move on to someone else's in a couple of weeks.  Absolutely.  And then once Bob Kelly gets a TV set, we're going to criticize that. 
[00:20:00]  We got a, uh, Sports Illustrated swimsuit model coming in.  Ooh, Daniella, uh, Sarah Bah.  I believe that's how you say her name.  Yeah.  She running for president.  And then we got Bob Saget calling in and, uh, Patrice O'Neill is going to be on channel  11 here in New York city in a little while.  And then he's going to be on our favorite CW 11.  I can't wait.  I don't know.  I don't know.  And then you got Voss and you got Kelly.  You got, uh, Valentine's day right around the corner.  And then, and, and lots of things to talk about. 
[00:20:30]  So we're, we're just getting started.  Wow.  Look at the phones.  Wow.  I know you talk about stuff like this.  People get interested.  Absolutely.  And we got some audio from Obama speaking last night.  Thank God.  At least you're admitting that he's going to be, uh, the nomination now.  It's really looking like, uh, he's going to be now these super, uh, delegates, very important  to Hillary, but we'll see.  He's absolutely got the momentum.  I mean, Hillary's scrambling for money.  This guy, Obama, they, they're throwing money at him. 
[00:21:00]  He's, he's at rallies where there's 16,000 people just cheering his name.  Like, uh, yeah.  And Clinton's getting a thousand or two.  Yeah.  And they already, uh, brought up the Coke thing with Obama.  So it's not like he, you know, what, what, what possibly can they have on this guy to  wreck this momentum?  I don't know.  Maybe there's some skeleton in there.  Oh, they did.  There's some skeleton.  And he's holding that closet door shut going, Oh, if they find this, you think radio guys  dig and find out, find out info about the competition, man, politicians are the worst. 
[00:21:30]  They are the worst.  Now, if the Republicans have anything on them, they'll wait until, uh, he is the nominee.  They already brought the Coke thing out.  Yeah.  But that, no, that's, that's, that's gotta be crack at the mind of the league stuff.  It's gotta be her.  That's if they have something, they'd wait for him to be the nominee so that they can knock  him down and not have like Hillary jump in there.  So they'll, they'll wait.  That's usually when the dirty tricks start getting played and the mudslinging.  And, uh, going back to superdelegates, uh, conflict of interest. 
[00:22:00]  Bill Clinton is a superdelegate.  Is he?  Yes.  Is Bill Clinton a superdelegate?  That's what I learned yesterday.  So you watch these dumb news programs and you, and then the, a mere six to eight hours  later, you look like an expert on a radio show.  It does seem like a little bit of a conflict.  Right?  Right?  If the Democrats nominate Hillary as the, as the, it's just a suicidal move.  If they are as dumb as they come, if they put her against the club, they got a much  better chance with Obama at this point.  Out of doubt.  And Sean Hannity said something very interesting.  Uh, he said that Obama would not take Clinton as the vice president, Hillary, of course, but 
[00:22:30]  Hillary without a doubt would take Obama as, uh, the vice president.  I thought that was very interesting.  Yeah.  All right.  We're just getting started.  The phone number, uh, we got a full house here, but, uh, if you're going to try to get  in later, the number is eight, seven, seven, two, one, two.  Oh, and a OP and Anthony.  Wait, Danny just gave me some great news.  That's hilarious.  By the way, it's whip them out Wednesday. 
[00:23:00]  Are we going to do this thing or what?  Are we going to do this thing?  I was walking out of New York city and I saw, um, a few wow stickers.  Yeah.  And I was thinking to myself, are we going to do this thing?  Are we going to, are we going to bring this thing back?  It's just been kind of bubbling under the surface.  Well, it's a nice, uh, warm, balmy day here in New York.  I understand that, but we got to start hyping it now.  Yeah.  I've seen more stickers lately though than I have in quite some time.  But it's bubbling.  That's what I'm asking the people today. 
[00:23:30]  Are we going to do this thing?  Back in the day, wow was massive.  Yep.  Are we going to bring this thing back in the spring?  Like in a huge way.  Yeah.  I think we ought to have a huge, uh, launch, maybe a wow party, maybe what we wanted to  do.  Wow stock.  Wow stock.  Yeah.  Yes.  It fits.  Yeah, absolutely.  Name and everything.  Well, it is.  All right.  Power boot this, uh, fan, please.  Thank you.  What happened?  Wow.  My, my computer just took the proverbial crapple.  Uh, that's funny cause I just did the same thing over there. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, really?  By the way, uh, whip them out Wednesday for the newbies.  We have newbies every day, which is really strange to me cause we've been at this a long  time.  Um, it's, uh, it means girls are going to show you a little, uh, a little something, something.  They're going to flash you.  All you have to do is, uh, get a wow sticker or a wow sign on your car.  That's it.  There are women out there.  They see that and they will flash on the way to work cause they're bored too.  And you drive around. 
[00:24:30]  It's like, uh, fishing.  You don't know when you're going to get a little tug on the line.  Yeah.  You just, uh, drive around and then all of a sudden, wham, there it is.  And, uh, the listeners understand the ladies don't want to have sex with you.  They're just trying to give you a little happiness in the morning or later in the day  cause it's happening all the time.  We just focus on it on Wednesdays, but for the most part, if a lady sees a wow sticker,  they're going to do it.  Or, or some of these ladies just don't follow them.  Don't harass them.  They don't want anything to do with you.  No, they're already banging three or four guys.  They don't have time for any, any more in their stable. 
[00:25:00]  And then what, where's Danny?  Danny, that was great news.  Great news.  If they have a problem with this, I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know what to tell you.  I don't know what else to do.  And then, well, I don't know what to say.  Right.  I was told that if you go visit the website, we can't promote.com, you might actually get  to the website we can't promote.  Websitewecantpromote.com. 
[00:25:30]  There's actually a website called thewebsitewecantpromote.com.  Yeah, well, we know what it ends with.  Yeah, right, right.  Yeah, it ends with the same thing every website ends with.  But it's called the website we can't promote.  You're making fun of me, but remember the days.  It's HTTP, Jimmy Colon, slash, slash.  No, you couldn't even say that.  You had to go backslash, backslash, www.  Oh, now you can just say that.  It's at the point where you don't even say .com anymore. 
[00:26:00]  You're right.  If it's something else, you know, .org.  You're right.  I think, you know what's going to take off?  .tv, my friends.  That's a...  Did you get your .tv address?  No.  No.  Why do we have two Black History Month honorees today?  One's for tomorrow.  Ooh, all right.  There you go.  Tomorrow's?  Wow, we're actually ahead?  Play it now.  That's never happened before.  No, that's a little strange.  We've got to play.  They're talking crazy. 
[00:26:30]  We're going to play yesterday's honoree one more time, and then we've got a new one for  today, a little later on in the show.  We've got some...  We're going to do the Obama thing in a second here, but we were having fun with this cop video  all morning.  I'm a cop, you idiot.  The cop is a D, really.  Anthony saw it the other way there, Danny.  Well, they're both kind of...  Anthony thought that the cop was doing his job and that the skater dude was a D.  Look, here's my problem.  Kids that age are just really a-holes. 
[00:27:00]  They're bratty.  And it's something that...  I don't know what it is.  The talking back to the cop thing, it really...  It's a no-win scenario.  And he just annoyed me because he sounded like every douche that I play on Call of Duty  4.  What are you doing?  You're gay.  You can't play this game.  I like this...  All versions of butthead. 
[00:27:30]  I blame the banning of the spanking, by the way.  Yes.  The blame...  Blame the banning of the spanking.  The complete lack of respect for the law.  Everyone over the age...  Did you get spanked, Danny?  Oh, yeah.  I used to get that.  How old are you?  How crap kicked out of me?  I'm 27.  27.  Okay.  So everyone over the age of, like, probably 25 has got the crap beat out of them growing  up, and you're not allowed to do that anymore.  And the kids know that, that nothing's really going to happen to you, so they wise off to 
[00:28:00]  you.  I would get in trouble at school, and my dad would take...  He would leave work early just to kick my ass at home.  Like, I would open the door to my house, and my dad would be waiting for me.  Yeah, absolutely.  And he would kick the crap out of me.  Oh, that's a tough one.  I remember that.  The skater dude, when we were growing up, not only would the cop beat the crap out of  him, and get away with it, because no one had video cameras, then you would get home  after your dad posted bail, and then he would beat the crap out of you.  Yeah, yeah.  You got the crap beat out of you twice. 
[00:28:30]  And then your mom would pull down your pants and give you a spanking, but tell you the  whole time, you know, this is for your own good.  There was no sympathy there.  And there's milk and cookies waiting for you after the spanking.  But it just never ended.  But guess what?  You didn't, you know, wise off to anybody.  No.  You got the discipline.  I missed my curfew once, and my dad came looking for me with a bat.  Yes!  And he found me, too.  A bat!  That's lovely.  He demolished my shin with an aluminum baseball bat.  And most parents understand how to, you know, to beat their kids the proper way. 
[00:29:00]  Unfortunately, there's a few out there that do it.  They get a little overzealous.  And they're the ones that ruin it for everybody else.  And that's why you got kids that are just wising off to everybody in sight.  Yeah.  Everybody in sight.  With that, you got a skateboarder.  Now, the cop obviously seems like some guy that perhaps has kids at home that don't listen  to dad.  Oh, yeah.  And he's taking it out on the skater kid.  But the skater kid mouthing off to the cop. 
[00:29:30]  When a cop, when I was a kid, if a cop came up to you and yelled like that, I'd have been  standing in excrement.  It would have just petrified me.  And this kid is just mouthing off.  He's got little smart-ass answers to everything the cop says.  And the cop just gets more and more pissed until he's got to, you know, grab him and throw  him around.  I'm definitely on the cop side, but it's kind of funny.  Oh, it's hysterically funny to watch.  I love it.  He's such a douche. 
[00:30:00]  That's the thing.  They're both...  That's why it's hard to take a side, because they're both being equally douchey.  Like, the kid is being a giant douche.  Yeah, and the guy is taking it...  He's taking it way too seriously.  Yeah.  Oh, wait a minute.  Is this where the kid gets thrown down?  Yeah.  Oh, the video I've seen is great.  Yeah, the video will be linked to onaradio.com later today.  I think I was actually on the kid's side, which is very rare for me to not be on the cop's  side.  I think this one, I thought the cop was just being a prick.  I was sort of on the kid's side to begin with, and then I kind of liked the cop by  the end.  He turned me around.  Here's some of the audio. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, I'm trying to comprehend some new things.  I need a little of a setup here, Danny.  Well, the audio does get louder.  That's why I couldn't boost everything or else...  Yeah, basically what's going on, the cop is noticing that they're skateboarding in a  place that they shouldn't be skateboarding, and now he's trying to get their attention.  Yeah, and apparently he had told them to stop skateboarding on whatever property that 
[00:31:00]  they were on, but they had headphones in, so they couldn't hear them.  Oh, is that what it was?  Yeah, and he wasn't buying it, so now he's out of the car and he's walking towards them.  Yeah.  Can you hear me now?  Hey, I'm talking to you.  Can you hear me?  Don't get defensive with me, son, because you're spending some time at Juvenile.  You're not allowed to ride your skateboards down here.  Nowhere.  Yeah, I didn't hear you.  That's why I asked you, Kevin.  Don't get defensive with me.  You back off me. 
[00:31:30]  I'm not your father.  You hear me?  I'm not your father.  You give that attitude to your father.  You give it to me, I'll smack him.  Yeah, I don't have a father.  Shut your mouth, I'm talking.  Here, shut up, dude.  Where are you from?  All right, his friend.  Okay, that's kind of cool.  He's like, I'm not your father.  I don't have a father.  That's the, he's gone or something.  Yeah, and the other kid's like, shut up.  Shut up, dude.  He knows.  See, the other kid knows.  Shut up.  Yeah. 
[00:32:00]  Can I tell you what really turned me around in this whole video now that I think about it?  The whole time, I thought I was a rent-a-cop, and I have no respect for rent-a-cops.  No, he's a real cop.  They're wannabes that weren't good enough to actually get a gun, in my opinion, the rent-a-cops.  And when I realized this was an actual police officer in the Baltimore area, I'm like, okay, I'm so with the cop.  Watch how fast, I love how fast he yells, shut your mouth!  He can't take this kid after 10 seconds.  Call him a cop.  Eric, shut up, dude. 
[00:32:30]  Where are you from?  Dude, I didn't do anything.  What are you from?  Eric, give me that skater.  Come here, kid.  Sit down.  What's that?  Sit down.  Sit down, I'm not a dude.  Eric, sit down.  You're damn right you're calling your mother.  Eric, sit down.  The other kid again.  Sit down.  Yeah.  He's the one that's like, look, I'm not going because of you, idiot.  Shut up.  Sit down.  Listen to this cop.  When you're missing, and it'll be up on onaradio.com, the cop puts him in a headlock and gets him 
[00:33:00]  down on the ground and rips his skateboard out of his hands, and that's when the kid goes,  I'm calling my mom.  Yeah, I'm calling my mom.  But the cop has a little car.  You can see it in the background.  Yeah.  It's this awful, like those little buggies they ride around.  It's really embarrassing.  It's the humiliation car.  I see him in New York City.  I feel bad for those guys.  They could drive up into your living room in that thing.  Yeah.  It looks like it's about a little bit wider than a person.  It's a golf cart with side doors.  That's about it.  It continues here. 
[00:33:30]  Cop doesn't like being called dude.  I didn't even do anything.  I didn't even hear you.  First of all, you disrespected me, this badge, and my department.  You understand me?  When I'm talking to you, you shut your mouth, and you listen.  Listen, obviously, your parents don't put a foot in your butt quite enough, because you  don't understand the meaning of respect.  First of all, you better learn how to speak.  I'm not man.  I'm not dude. 
[00:34:00]  I am Officer Rivieri.  The sooner you learn that, the longer you're going to live in this world.  Because you go around doing this kind of stuff, somebody's going to kill you.  This guy's a jerk-off.  What we're dealing with here is a complete lack of respect for the law.  Dude, I one time was coming down.  I think I talked about it in the air.  I was driving recently, and I'm completely on the side of the cops.  Yeah.  The cop asked me, I beeped at a guy who wasn't moving, because the cops were doing something 
[00:34:30]  and the guy was rubbernecking.  So I'm irritating.  Like, just go.  Stop looking.  So the cop walks over to my window, and he says something about the beep.  I'm like, oh, I'm sorry, buddy.  He was just sitting outside.  He goes, I'm not buddy.  I'm officer.  I'm like, you douche.  Well, they like the respect of the uniform.  And after that, I know what you said.  Pray for me.  Oh, I was thinking of that so many times during the show.  That's supposed to be in my machine today.  I was so hysterical.  Pray for me. 
[00:35:00]  Pray for me.  Linger longer.  A day.  He knew what I was saying.  He knew I was being very polite and respectful.  I was being a jerk.  I was agreeing with him.  It's almost like if he liked being called officer, I thought I would have said, okay, officer.  Yeah.  Like, they don't like that either.  Yeah.  I was being, my tone was very respectful.  Well, the only thing worse is if this guy would have pulled up on a Segway.  One of those stupid two-wheel things.  Those things.  Hey, you kids.  Wait, get back here. 
[00:35:30]  They're just skateboarding away from him at twice his speed.  The end of the clip is really, really funny.  Yeah.  It's really classic.  And it's going to sound like it just stops.  But you really just got to pay attention to the last thing that this officer says.  Yeah.  Right before it stops.  Yeah.  Because I guess the camera got turned off.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Son, what is your problem?  Do you go to school and give your teacher this kind of lip and backtalk your teacher?  Then what makes you think you can come and do it to a police officer? 
[00:36:00]  Stop calling me dude.  A dude is somebody who works on a ranch.  Your friend's got brains in their head.  They don't want to shut their mouth.  You just keep flapping.  You got that camera on?  If I find myself where you are right now.  On YouTube.  YouTube and every other site and the news. 
[00:36:30]  National radio show.  Because if I find myself on.  That's an attention getter.  A lively, bipartisan, dredgeport.  As soon as I get home, the first thing I'm going to do is punch your mouth in the mouth.  This is actually a different one that I was thinking of.  There's another one where a girl gets thrown down and he like tackles the skateboarder.  I thought that was this one.  Oh.  No, they apparently don't like the skateboarders.  Leave the skateboarders alone.  Bruce, Louisiana. 
[00:37:00]  What's up?  Yeah, he sounds just like that fat douche cop in Super Troopers Farva.  I want a goddamn leader of cola.  Farva.  A leader of cola.  A leader of cola.  I love that.  I don't want a large farva.  That's very funny.  Stephanie, you're on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up?  Hi, I want to know when he's going to say, I live in a van down by the river. 
[00:37:30]  He does kind of sound like Farley.  You blew the line, but yes, very good observation.  He does have a little Farley in him.  Very nice.  Thank you.  Thanks.  Bye-bye.  All right, Stephanie, everyone.  That's great Farva.  Oh, you mean shenanigans?  Oh.  I just lost a dollar to myself.  Hey, rookie.  That's fantastic. 
[00:38:00]  Well, we got Mike from the NYPD on the phone.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, what's up, Bowen?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Pretty good, man.  I heard you guys talking.  That was a funny clip that you guys were talking about.  I really want to see it.  But you know what?  We really do hate punk kids.  But we can't really do that because of the law and everything like that.  But what that cop did, we would love to really do.  Just to let you guys know.  You can tell that there's this cop, too, because he's wearing these little shorts and he's outside.  He's like, I know where he's at in Baltimore.  It looks like a little Baltimore, like a marina area. 
[00:38:30]  You know what?  Other cops, we hate cops like that because they give us a bad name.  Those are guys that take their job way too seriously.  We definitely don't like cops like that.  Well, they're cops that are probably not dealing with the type of people that most of the cops in New York are dealing with.  Even though Baltimore can be really rough.  He looks like he's in a pretty nice place in Baltimore.  It's down by the marina.  There's a bunch of skateboarders that don't look like much of a criminal element down there.  He sounds like a cop trying to prove himself as opposed to most of New York cops. 
[00:39:00]  We hate people like that.  We don't have to prove ourselves.  Well, that guy has...  That guy has...  Oh, sorry.  He's got the easy detail.  It's that marina area in Baltimore that's like a very, very nice area.  It's not the wire area.  Yeah.  Right, right, right.  That was like a drug bust for that guy.  I mean, it doesn't get any greater than that.  Telling a skateboarder to move on.  That's about all he gets down there.  Yeah, it's like a felony warrant.  Yeah.  He's ready to knock the door down.  What's it called?  It has a name and everything.  The Baltimore...  The marina...  Is it just called... 
[00:39:30]  Baltimore Harbor.  Huh?  The harbor area.  Yeah.  Harbor.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Later.  All right.  Have a good one.  Oh, sorry.  Let's go to Don the Trucker.  Don?  Yeah.  That cop was a douche.  What they oftentimes forget is that they're a public servant with the emphasis on servant.  Oh, geez.  Yeah.  My tax dollars are paying these men.  A public servant.  Yeah, I love when people do that, too, out the window to a cop.  You're a public servant and I pay your salary.  Yeah. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, get out of the car.  Get out of the car.  We're going to have some fun.  Oh, are we going to have some fun today?  I just think kids need to be beat up, so...  That kid was just being a smartass, too.  I mean, the cop was being an ass, but that kid wouldn't shut up.  It's one of those kids that can't just shut his mouth.  Right.  Everything would have been fine if he just would have shut up and said, yes, sir.  Okay.  I didn't hear you. 
[00:40:30]  We're leaving now.  Absolutely.  All right.  You remember.  Whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever.  And then you walk away.  But that whole thing, you know, do you talk to your dad like that?  I don't have a dad.  It's like, why do you even say that?  And then when he pins him on the ground, I'm calling my mom like that's going to do anything.  Play Green Day.  Yeah.  Shut up.  Do you take requests?  This is what Ant and I had to deal with.  We go up to Boston to, you know, do afternoons, and we want to, like, do this whole edgy talk thing. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  And we still had to play music.  And we had, like, phone call after phone call after phone call, just like that skater did.  Play Green Day and shut up.  Yeah.  We'd do some bit.  And, you know, occasionally we would do something that was a little better than the blimp thing.  Sure.  And, you know, we'd hope to get maybe a reaction on the phone.  Yeah.  And we'd go to the phones and you'd just hear, like, it was Worcester kids sounding like Beavis  and Buttheads.  It's like, so, what did you think of that last bit or call or something? 
[00:41:30]  Uh, what?  Just put on some Green Day.  Oh, were you listening to the bit at?  No.  Uh, play some Radiohead.  All right, you little bastard.  When are you going to play Limp Bizkit?  Uh, play some Butthole Surfers. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, you just, why are we here doing this?  Right.  Why?  Why?  I don't know what you just did, but can I request the butt trumpets?  Butt trumpets.  You're ugly by the butt trumpets, please?  Actual band, by the way.  Uh, let's say, uh, let's say hi to Todd on Long Island as we head toward a break.  Todd, what's up?  Get here, Ted.  How you doing?  Good.  I just wanted to make a quick comment.  I teach high school on Long Island.  Yeah.  And, uh, half these kids, you say anything to them, their words out of their mouth is, 
[00:42:30]  I'll sue you.  I'll call my mom.  I'll call my dad.  I'll sue you.  You can't do this.  You can't do that.  Give them something to sue for.  Hey, I'll tell you right now.  Uh, fat lip.  If McCain...  Look, a lot of people know I want Obama, but if McCain gets on TV and says, uh, that he's  going to allow parents to beat the crap out of their kids again, I vote for McCain.  I don't think he's for beatings.  I don't think McCain's for any form of beatings whatsoever.  Oops, good point.  I'm for the breaking of children's arms and the bayonetting of their groin. 
[00:43:00]  If I had to go through it, you all do.  That'll be like something he says that totally puts him under.  You just get, like, silence in the crowd, and that's it.  Barack wins.  Oh, Patrice is on.  Yeah, we're getting that on tape.  Huggy Bear.  Huggy Bear's on Channel 11 right now.  Yeah, Patrice O'Neal, we'll get the audio.  Huggy the size of a bear.  He'll say something ridiculous that'll get him in trouble.  Of course he will.  You know, people think we're bridge burners.  Patrice, oh my God.  He was born with a flame. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, he's the worst.  Not a likable guy.  You notice Hannity didn't even acknowledge him yesterday when he called our show?  No.  Patrice was great on his show.  Absolutely.  Sean!  Sean!  Yeah, he can continue.  Sean, what?  Is that a red velvet blazer he's wearing?  What is it?  I don't know.  And that fedora?  A black pimp hat.  He actually looks good, though.  I hate to say it.  He can wear it.  He pulls it off because he's a big black guy.  I like his new look.  He's looking like a pimp. 
[00:44:00]  Yes.  Cedric the Mediocre Entertainer.  It makes me sick.  He sees every other black comic.  They're all dressed very well.  No one dresses sloppy like he does in his dumb football jerseys.  That's what he was wearing.  You don't see him wearing that anymore.  His big colorful football jerseys and stuff.  And his baseball caps with the tags still on it.  And a flat rim.  Sure.  That stupid hat.  And his big velvet coat.  There he is in his stymie hat. 
[00:44:30]  He's got his hat that stymie wore on Little Rascals.  What is he promoting right now?  Is he hosting Masterpiece Theater in that jacket?  I want to spit pea soup on his jacket.  He'll be here right after this appearance.  Yeah.  He'll be in studio in 15 minutes.  That'll take the heat off of me.  It sure will.  I don't know.  Patrice is good for piling on.  Oh, he's the worst.  That awful jacket will help.  We moved on.  But I just got to take you inside the bit.  I was going with that McCain thing. 
[00:45:00]  And I got really uncomfortable.  And my whole body heated up.  What happened?  Well, I realized what I said.  What did you say?  Well, if McCain said, you know, parents are allowed to beat your kids anymore.  And I'm like, wow, I just picked the wrong guy.  Yeah, yeah.  The torture.  And now I'm uncomfortable.  And I need deodorant.  I'm sweating so bad.  Oh, you sweat a little on that one?  Like, oh, the beating of kids.  Oh, he wouldn't be the one.  No.  I should have said Hucklebee.  Or is it Huckabee?  Huckabee.  Huckabee.  I heart Huckabees.  I just think of like a cartoon when I hear his name. 
[00:45:30]  Huckabee.  All right.  Black History Month.  Yesterday's honoree.  We got a new one on the way.  But in case you missed yesterday's, here it is.  In honor of Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony Show is honoring black heroes, African-American  individuals throughout history, without whom this country would not be the melting pot it  is today.  Today, we honor the late Scatman Crothers, songwriter, composer, actor, comedian, guitarist, star  of stage, screen, television, and of course, The Shining. 
[00:46:00]  Hello?  Anybody here?  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Stay tuned for more icons of black history.  Can I guys be back?  On the Opie and Anthony Show.  Right back at it.  Opie and Anthony.  Rich Voss in studio. 
[00:46:30]  We got the whole gang pretty much coming in today.  Rich.  Bob Kelly's on his way in.  Patrice O'Neill, who just did TV here in New York City, he's coming in.  And a little later on this morning, we're all going to take a look at Jim Norton's first  TV appearance.  Can't wait.  Oh, it's going to be ugly.  Good.  I mean, we took a beating, what, two weeks ago, Ant?  Yeah, when we played some of our old radio shows from when we first got a radio show  together.  Yeah.  Oh!  It was the tape that was 12 years old, and Jimmy's is about 10 or 11, so this is going 
[00:47:00]  to be a lot of fun later on.  I think people are going to enjoy it more than you think.  I don't think so.  I can't wait to hear your little voice.  Pray for me.  Pray for me.  Jimmy used to do a little character.  Yeah.  I was like him on high energy.  It wasn't just Jimmy.  Like, Jimmy comes out now, and he's Jimmy.  You know, he talks like Jimmy.  He acts like Jimmy.  But apparently, and I haven't heard this or seen this, he comes out as a little character.  Do you have the first line of it if you want to tease it? 
[00:47:30]  Do you have it in front of you, or do you not have it?  Oh, go get it.  Oh, I would love to just tease.  You have to tease so people can hear it.  I just want to hear your voice.  What was the first place I met you?  New Brunswick.  It was North Brunswick.  It was a gig we were doing together that was canceled that night, and you were a douche.  No.  Yeah, no one likes you when they first meet you.  He makes a worse, like, first impression than hepatitis.  Voss, the first time I was getting 50 bucks, and me and you and Vinnie Brown were doing  a gig, and the guy's like, look, I'll give you all 50, but I can't pay you.  And Voss goes, this is not a hobby, pal. 
[00:48:00]  But then he goes to me, you're the opener.  You're only getting 50.  High five, Rich.  I hear you, bro.  I'm with you.  But then he says to me, you're only getting 50.  You're lucky we're giving you that.  I went, gee, thanks, guy with a ponytail.  Yes, you did.  No, I probably took a liking to you.  This is a hobby, pal.  I kind of loved him for it, because Voss was so brutally honest.  The first time I met Voss was at Caroline's, and he was killing, and he's making fun of  everyone, and I'm thinking, what an ass.  I hate this guy. 
[00:48:30]  He is way too cocky for his tiny little body.  And now we're all friends.  I remember hating you.  And I even had to talk to you afterwards.  I'm like, ugh, I'll never have this guy.  But then something happened.  I think you have Norton to thank.  I was in here before Norton.  Oh, wow.  We remember that.  I'll tell you the first time.  The first time was that lady that touched a lick.  She held lights.  Linger Linger.  You were in for that?  She went through her hand and stuff.  She was some Brazilian guy, and I was smashing him. 
[00:49:00]  Sure.  Yeah, you remember that.  She was standing in water or something.  Yeah, it was just the good old days.  Hey, Bob.  Bob Kelly in studio, too.  How'd you get in?  It even greased the door.  Hey, Bobby.  He's losing weight.  I know.  He looks good.  I gave him a ride home last night, and the car didn't lean as much.  Oh, smashed.  It looked like a black guy was driving it.  Smashed.  Pretty good.  All right, Rich.  Yeah.  You barely sat down.  I don't think I even sat down.  I'm telling Rich to relax now.  I'm going to actually take you out of the game for just a minute. 
[00:49:30]  Okay.  You were really good right there.  You always end up blowing it.  Yeah.  He'll just make it an amazing three-pointer, and the next time down the court, air ball  from 10 feet out.  All right, listen.  We got...  Oh, we do have it.  You want a little taste?  I just want to hear a little bit of Jimmy's little character that he used to be.  All right, we got...  It wasn't as bad as it was in 93.  This was a couple years later. 
[00:50:00]  It was better.  Yeah.  I think it gave me an impression with this, actually.  All right, let's...  All righty.  Let's find out.  Just a taste of what we're going to do later on in the show.  Norton, what year is this?  96?  Two years ago.  You want to say 81?  My first TV experience.  96 is a long time ago, though.  I taped it in Conan's studio.  You had to look up at the audience.  It's the only time I've ever been in Conan's studio.  Yeah.  I'm not good enough to do a show, apparently.  So I was there taping Friday night.  Well, you had to look up at the book when you got the gig.  I hate it when the Jew is on fire, apparently. 
[00:50:30]  All right, now go play some defense.  You're doing very good.  He's scaring me.  Is this the new Vos?  No.  When do I ever fail?  You're like the LeBron James of radio right now, man.  I was going to just trash Conan, but screw it.  He doesn't really care about this show whatsoever for some reason.  Here's Norton on TV for the first time.  Thank you. 
[00:51:00]  Thank you.  How are you?  You're laughing at me.  Oh.  No, that's good, man.  That's good.  You're high energy.  You got a little voice, and people will instantly look at you and pay attention because they'll  want to see what type of assy douche that voice is coming out of.  Right after he went, how are you?  His bow tie spun around.  Hi.  How are you?  Know what I'm learning quickly, and we should tell the newbies out there that want to get 
[00:51:30]  into radio or to become a comedian like these guys.  You got to get past the I'm excited to be here stage and right to the bitter stage if  you're ever going to make it.  Right to the angry, I've been crapped on my whole career.  We just played a tape of us a few weeks back, and we were just happy to be here.  Everything was like, whoo, whoo, whoo.  Had to be so full of energy.  And the ratings were just so, so.  As soon as we were like, F management, F this station, F this, F that, the bitterness. 
[00:52:00]  Through the roof.  Ratings went through the roof.  Any comic, and I say this on stage yet, they run to the stage, they stink.  Yeah.  Because nobody runs to work in the morning.  Is it that slow little jog walk, like run up to the stage?  Or if you see them on the side of the stage, and they're shadow boxing, David, if you were  in a hospital where they have heart surgery, and you look up, and the surgeon is shadow  boxing, you're probably going to die.  You don't want him.  You have to find your, I mean, I came off, and the cellar and my pal Jerry goes, wow, 
[00:52:30]  you really found your voice.  Like, I didn't know you'd watch my whole set.  Jerry who?  Doesn't matter.  Oh, buddy.  We're just going on after.  Oh, really?  Jerry?  That would be so.  Oh, really?  I'll say it for Jerry.  Oh, well.  Now, what happened?  Oh, no.  A few nights ago.  I just.  Oh, a few nights ago.  No big deal.  Jerry Seinfeld?  Yeah, yeah.  He's in the hallway.  He said you found your voice?  He goes, why?  Was it in the meat packing district?  Are you feeling okay?  Yeah, what's up with the boss? 
[00:53:00]  Geez.  You found your, he said you really found your voice.  Yeah, this was all the political stuff I did.  I didn't, you know, he was there.  And he's like, wow.  You really found your voice.  Then he goes, like Hillary, because I was making fun of her voice.  And I started talking about her voice.  And he goes, no, no, no, I'm not talking about her.  I'm talking about you.  Like, it was so funny.  He saw me try to get out of the compliment.  I'm so low.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And I'm like, man, I don't know how to take a compliment.  So we just, you know, we just chatted a couple of men about his Larry King interview.  You know how it is.  How about that, Bobby?  Man, a similar ill-cooled.  How about that, Bobby?  I remember my conversation with him.  And it ended with not you.  Not you.  If I would have thought, next time I see Jer, I'm going to mention that. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, Jer.  Yeah, it's Jer now.  Yeah, yeah.  I forgot.  All his good friends.  All his good friends calling that.  Nothing would make me happier than you to get a nice fat not you.  Hey, Jerry, yeah, I want to say, not you.  Maybe I will.  I'll say, hey, are you going to ignore someone today?  And Jerry will look at me and go, not you.  Not you.  See that, Bob, how that works?  Yeah.  Wow.  So he was kind of a secret.  Watched your set?  Yeah.  Complimented you on it?  Yeah, he went on after me.  But you know how it is.  Guys like us go back to back. 
[00:54:00]  Sure.  We just talk about stuff.  Yeah, you guys have so much in common.  Absolutely.  That's something.  Like, did you ever notice when a girl poops on your chest?  How was Jerry's sets these days?  I didn't watch it.  I went up to eat.  But he said he's working on it.  Because of course, he was like, hey, when you watch Jerry's set?  Yeah, how do you not watch Jerry's set?  Because he didn't want to go to sleep.  No, I had to.  Oh, look at the bitter Bobby.  Someone got their feelings hurt.  Well, no, he was.  I said to him, like, what have you been up to?  And he said how horrible it was making the B movie.  Like, it was a lot of work and it was a pain in the ass.  Yeah. 
[00:54:30]  And I used to just put a new set together.  No, no, I didn't watch it.  I had to actually leave and pick up my check.  I had to go.  How horrible it is to take the boatloads of money he made off of that B movie.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Jimmy's getting away from this thing.  He certainly is.  All right, let's get back.  That voice is great.  When he said that to you, did you go, thank you, Jerry?  Thank you.  Yes, thank you.  Here's Jimmy from about 10 or 11 years ago on TV for the first time.  Thank you.  Thank you.  How are you? 
[00:55:00]  Good.  I feel good, man.  I'm in a great mood.  I feel sexy.  I feel sexy.  Wasn't a joke, but thank you for laughing.  You just laugh.  You fake laugh at your own joke.  Jimmy's cringing.  I love this.  I forgot about this.  My name should be Jim from Munaki.  There's a lot of fake laughing.  Do you write that down? 
[00:55:30]  Laugh.  Right after the punchline, laugh.  And then dot, dot, dot.  Oh, is that cringe-inducing?  I'm joking, but thanks.  Almost like we're all in this together, folks.  Right.  I'm your point.  Just one of the guys like you.  Oh, Jesus.  Did anybody let the air to you and suck it in their mouth so they could talk high, too?  Too wordy.  I know.  It was too wordy.  I knew it was coming.  You really do sound like a pet for a wizard. 
[00:56:00]  Hang over a wizard's shoulder.  You little flapping wings.  Hey, what's going on?  What's going on over here?  What do you want to do, boss?  Oh, I hate you.  I hate you.  Bob, my girlfriend told me that when she was Christmas shopping for me, she went into  the cellar, and she made the error of him and stupid Keith Robinson, who we should  have had today, asking him, what should I get him for Christmas?  And apparently that was an open door to a lot of unpleasant suggestions.  I bet.  I laughed. 
[00:56:30]  She said the funniest thing was when Bob said, how about a turtle suit?  They gave me a beating.  And it's going to happen now.  Push the button.  What were you wearing on this first?  I don't know.  What were you wearing?  I had like a black, I think I had black jeans and a black mock turtleneck.  I think that was a black mock turtleneck and a pair of jeans.  His manager there was with him.  I remember Barrett was with you.  It was your big...  Were you with me?  Yeah. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  It was your first TV show.  I used to support you a lot until we were in LA, and we were all doing TV tapings, myself,  him, and Florentine.  We were taping for a Louis Anderson show.  So they taped, and I went to their show, right?  And then the next night I was taping, and they went with...  They met Dice, and they went with Dice Furniture Shopping.  No, we hung with Dice that night because...  Yeah, we went because...  Because he could help your career.  No, no.  I didn't think he'd ever help my career.  Because I loved him.  I idolized him.  I looked up to him.  So I wanted to...  And it did change my life. 
[00:57:30]  Through Andrew, I got all this experience, and he brings me to Opie and Anthony.  You'd be holding resentment for that.  I was amazed, but it was almost like...  I'm not British.  Yeah.  It was like Dice.  It wasn't like I did it to hang out with wheels.  Right.  You sure it wasn't a real turtleneck with just your awful neck.  It turned into a mock turtleneck?  Jimmy makes a good point.  It wasn't Yakov Shmirnov.  It was Dice.  I couldn't believe he was there.  And he called me in Florentine the next day.  Goes, get dressed.  We're going to go shopping.  I'm like, how do you say no to that?  Yeah.  It was fun.  Hey, Swanson from New York.  You're on the show. 
[00:58:00]  Hey, Swanson.  What's up?  Norton sounds like the pregnant lady from Fargo.  Hi, how are you?  Back to the tape.  I was younger.  All right, back to the tape.  Yeah.  I wanted to look sexy because it's my first TV taping and there'd be some hot women here  and I wanted to look good, you know, so I ran out and spent $15 on a haircut that I  could have gotten for free in a mental institution.  Oh, horrifying, isn't it?  This is awful.  Yes.  I grew up with a military father, which is why I got this.  And I hated that because my father was a drunk and he was a very embarrassing man to 
[00:58:30]  be around because he would take me and my mother out and introduce us to people.  It was like, this is my wife and this is my son.  This is for fighting.  This is for fun.  Okay, okay, okay.  Hit the button.  I don't want to hear anymore.  It's ruining my impression of Jimmy.  I assumed you were always brilliant.  That was a pretty good joke.  The mental institution joke was a good joke. 
[00:59:00]  Yes, yes.  She laughed over it at the wrong time.  I liked the mental institution joke to follow the haircut that I could have got for free  in a mental institution.  That wasn't a bad opening.  To follow it up with that little singy songy.  I was like, this is my wife and I grabbed my hog.  This is for fighting.  This is for fun.  Oh, they should crank a box and you should pop out of it.  Which one was for fighting?  I didn't analyze it like that.  I was just doing the full metal jacket thing.  Yeah, but this is my wife and this is my son.  This is for fighting. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, the wife.  The wife's for fighting.  Yeah, I just grabbed the hog.  But then what's the son for?  It became irrelevant.  He rhymes.  The son rhymes.  So the son was there.  I thought that meant there was a little father-son incest.  No, no, no.  It was nothing nasty.  I didn't know.  They just pat you on the top of the head and this is for fun?  No, no.  Did you want to go in the direction of song parodies after that?  After that big, I mean, the applause and stuff.  Did you think maybe, you know.  I don't like the fact that you're asking this, but in not a very sincere way.  I think that you're asking this with sarcasm. 
[01:00:00]  No, because I mean, I remember when you used to do that bit and sometimes you used to march  on the stage and do it.  What?  Well, oh yeah.  He used to march.  He used to get into character and he would march across the stage like he was in the army.  Right?  Of course.  I didn't march.  Let's go back to the tape.  I'd tell you if I'd march.  I don't like you.  I can finish laughing.  Yeah, they were laughing.  And he was scary.  My father was very scary because he would have, he would have Vietnam flashbacks, which 
[01:00:30]  was horrifying because he was never there.  All right.  That's not bad.  One time he pulled me up against the wall.  He said, do you know what I went through in 1967?  Canadian customs?  Take your time with that.  Thank you for laughing.  Those that didn't, you know, did we fight Canada?  All right.  All right.  All right.  It's so weird that you do a parody and then you're too hip for the room, all in one.  I was just, you know.  Dude, your little giggle at the end of everything that's supposed to be funny. 
[01:01:00]  Why don't you just tickle them after everything?  And this whole thing is, like, really weird.  You know how my father was, uh...  Why did you do that voice?  Because he'd go through Canadian customs.  He was younger.  He was high energy.  Yeah.  I get it.  That's before he goes up with a bunch of stuff.  You should be in a blimp, bombing a TV station.  Bob, let's go. 
[01:01:30]  When's Fatso coming in?  When's Patrice coming in?  He just did.  We got more from Jim Norton's first TV appearance later on in the show.  Patrice O'Neill joined the program.  Bob Saget actually calling in.  And other things to get to.  We have a penthouse girl.  We have a pretty busy show.  Actually, he's a Sports Illustrated swimsuit model.  A little different.  Very sexy.  Very, very sexy.  Kentucky Fried Chicken's coming in.  When is he coming in?  I don't know.  He should be...  He's at CW 11.  Is he in his new outfits? 
[01:02:00]  He's in a pimp outfit.  Wait till you see what he's wearing today.  He's big pimping.  Yeah, let's keep it at that.  He's dressed like the room Voss does at New Year's Eve gigs in.  Well, I just do it for fun.  Oh, wow.  I knew he was coming.  With that, we got it.  Good evening.  Yeah.  With that, we got another Oscar moment from The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show presents Oscar Moments.  Memorable scenes from Academy Award-nominated films. 
[01:02:30]  Today's Oscar moment comes from the film Michael Clayton.  When was the last time you took one of these?  No.  No, I'm not losing this.  Everything is now finally sufficient.  The world is a beautiful and radiant place, and I'm not trading that for this.  If it's real, the pill won't kill it.  I have blood on my hands.  You are the senior litigation partner of one of the largest, one of the most respected law firms in the world.  You are a legend. 
[01:03:00]  I'm an accomplice.  You are a manic depressive.  I am Shiver, the god of death.  Stay tuned for more Oscar Moments, presented by The Opie and Anthony Show.  We got a full house today.  Opie and Anthony, Patrice O'Neal has joined the program.  Looking like a pimp.  Looking like a pimp, but he's looking good.  Looking like a pimp.  And now he's going around the room and talking about all of us and how we're dressed. 
[01:03:30]  He looks like every...  I mean, y'all can step it up a little.  He doesn't look like every black guy in Easter.  He looks like a float in a parade.  That's horrible.  Just because he's got a sport coat on it.  It's velvet, and it looks like Anthony's cousin's living room.  It really does.  It looks like a couch in a coffee shop in the East Village.  I know.  It really is horrible.  Is somebody doing spoken word on you later?  It really does look like antique furniture.  Hold on.  I don't have to take this.  Let me button up my top button. 
[01:04:00]  Thank you, Anthony.  If you can, leave short-stay motel curtains alone.  Oh, man.  Oh, what bastards.  But Patrice, explain why the suit, though.  Because you want to be taken a little more seriously, right?  I was mad at the NBA when they made him wear suits.  I was mad that they forced somebody to wear suits.  But when Eddie Curry had a suit on one day, he was talking.  I was listening.  I never listened to Eddie Curry.  It's just, there's a something that actually looks good when you got on a sports coat for some return. 
[01:04:30]  You take it more seriously if you wear nicer clothes.  I think so.  People listen to you more.  What's the problem?  He's almost 40.  I am.  I'm 38.  Don't you point at almost 40, 42.  I'm 39.  But he stands in the mirror.  Still trying to grow a beard.  It won't happen.  You want to make a million bucks?  You got to look like a million bucks.  I know.  A million bucks.  Hey, Patrice.  Reading books?  How to change your image at Influence Radio, guys. 
[01:05:00]  Dress for success.  What?  Dress for success.  That's what Rob Bartlett told me when I started comedy.  Is that why you have a squirrel skin coat?  What happens?  Dress for success.  Is that why?  You dress like the Japanese on D-Day.  You couldn't dress less for success.  And Bobby Kelly refuses to let me actually dress like this.  Because I don't.  He won't let me dress nice. 
[01:05:30]  I just don't like it.  You know, listen, you go through, you're like Madonna.  You go through these phases.  You're wearing these, the hoodies with the team logos.  I don't go with a phase.  I've been wearing hoodies for my entire life.  Bobby's just upset because it's hard to find a 58 Portly.  No, Bob doesn't like, Bob doesn't like his friend changing and growing up.  Because Bob is very like things, like a group of buddies.  I don't like that at all.  I'm the only one who got married out of you bunch of creeps.  Oh, really?  Listen.  Oh, well, yeah. 
[01:06:00]  Whatever.  Well, and you notice that Patrice has been trying on a few different hats.  Well, the hats, that's what kills me.  I think the one he's got today is the one he really likes, though.  But that's what kills me.  He walked in the cellar with a 10-gallon hat.  I wanted to punch him in his face.  Bobby said the funniest thing ever.  It almost made me leave and stop dressing like that.  I had on a checkered, I had a striped shirt with a checkered pants or something that was crazy.  He goes, you look like you're trying to start your own line of barbecue sauce.  It was the funniest thing I think Bobby had ever said in his life. 
[01:06:30]  And with Bobby, it goes right back to food.  You know?  He looked like no country for fat men.  Whoa.  Hold on.  One more, one more, one more.  That joke made a garbage truck ride on the side of the street and kill two people.  I wish your jacket fell out of it.  It's the U-turn to hit your jacket.  Oh, boy.  You dumb hats. 
[01:07:00]  But he's digging this hat.  He's had three different ones in the last month.  I think he's going to stick with this one.  If I drink your jacket, will that help my kidneys?  Cranberry.  Thanks, Voss.  Oh, wow.  This is why I like dressing nice.  If this really was bad, Voss would never.  I know it looks good because Norton is not trash.  It actually did look bad.  I wanted to hate it.  But I saw him on CW 11 and it worked.  Except the problem is this is what Patrice is.  Patrice is fucking old. 
[01:07:30]  Look at Jimmy.  Jimmy's dropping F-bombs.  We're angry.  It just makes us angry.  Why are my friends mad at me for wearing a sports jacket?  I thought they were going to do it.  I'm just trying.  When I saw you on CW 11, I thought they were going to do the weather in front of you.  Can you let Jimmy fall?  I don't get it.  Damn, what?  You know how the green ones?  Oh, green.  Take him out of the game.  It's too late.  The problem is Patrice is white trash.  Patrice is tuxedo topless sweatpants when he's sitting at a desk. 
[01:08:00]  It's a nice jacket and a nice hat, but then he has blue jeans and crumpy sneakers.  He dresses as nice as he has to at any given moment.  I'm trying to maintain something.  Patrice, if you get on all fours, we can play hold them on your back.  All the velvet.  I just did.  Wow.  Wow.  That was a sneaky good one.  Oh, damn.  I was getting nervous.  I wasn't going to get anything for that.  All right.  Yeah, it's hot in here.  I should have went with black jacket.  It has nothing to do with success. 
[01:08:30]  It's just a new boy.  It's not hot in here.  He's wearing curtains.  Look at him sweating.  All right.  Well, that was Jimmy's joke.  Thank you, Anthony, for publicly announcing that you like my new look.  I just thought the second you walked in, you had your hat and your jacket on, and yet you  were a bigger presence than you have been when you just walk in wearing your sports jersey  and baseball cap. 
[01:09:00]  He's 6'5", wearing red velvet.  You're acting like it's a star quality, but he's a spectacle with a Jewish hat on.  There was some kind of a star quality.  Really?  Thank you.  It just looked, you looked more impressive and important.  Yeah, we got to give it to him.  You looked more important.  You got to work on the jeans, bud.  He has a Hasidic Jew hat on.  He looks like every guy Kojak arrested.  He really does.  All right.  Hey, uh... 
[01:09:30]  He really stinks.  Let's move on to a little material today.  It's going to be just a bash fest.  I understand that.  Oh!  Here comes Jimmy Urkel Norton.  No, no, no.  We're going to go back to that in a second, but we got the video, the paraplegic.  We have to talk about this, and the video will be up on onaradio.com.  Is Danny around to explain this?  Basically, there's a paraplegic, and there was a cop that didn't think he was paralyzed  or whatever, and he dumped him out onto the floor. 
[01:10:00]  Right, Danny?  And another videotape.  What are the cops, crazy?  There's videotapes everywhere, and this guy looks real bad.  Yeah, it's tough to explain this one to a jury that you didn't mean.  What happened, Danny?  I don't know, man.  I watched a few different versions of the story, and they don't really get into why  he was dumped out of the wheelchair.  It just looks like the cop was angry at him for whatever reason.  I've heard they thought he was drunk, and they didn't believe that he was paralyzed. 
[01:10:30]  Well, he's not in a wheelchair.  How do you get drunk and then get a wheelchair?  Was he white?  Yeah.  Here's the story.  Terrible story out of Florida.  You should mention the video you are about to see is really quite disturbing.  Several employees from the Tampa Sheriff's Office are in trouble.  Hilarious.  After a disturbing encounter with a quadriplegic.  Officials say Brian Sterner was brought to jail on outstanding charges for eluding police. 
[01:11:00]  During the booking process, a sheriff's deputy dumped Sterner from his wheelchair.  Sterner's attorney wants felony charges brought against the deputy, as well as three other  employees, because they didn't stop the attack.  Sterner is a former high school wrestler who suffered a spine injury 14 years ago.  Well, it's not like he felt it.  Here's the thing, too.  That cop did to a guy in a wheelchair what every one of us wants to do in a guy in a wheelchair.  Just tip him out on the floor and have a laugh. 
[01:11:30]  How did he elude him?  I know.  Yeah, that's the trick.  With his thumbs.  He's the gas with their thumbs when they drive the cars.  Maybe hitting the crater of a bomb like that.  Just amazing.  So that video will be up on onaradio.com.  It's a really funny video. 
[01:12:00]  The guy just spills out.  And the great part, he has movement on the upper top.  But the back, the bottom two legs, his legs are just kind of twisted like, uh, can you,  can you?  Yeah, he's just laying there on the floor.  Doink.  Yeah.  But look at him, he's moving and his legs are all twisted sideways and feeling stupid.  He's feeling stupid.  Like jello on the floor.  Yeah.  Oh.  We should make a rap video to this or something.  Just a remix.  Obviously, this man is lying.  Okay.  What's Peter Griffith's friend on The Family Guy? 
[01:12:30]  Oh, yeah.  The people guy.  I love what they do to him on Family Guy.  Oh, man.  You want another taste of Norton's first TV appearance?  Oh, please.  Oh, y'all already started?  Yeah.  Well, we just got a little taste of it.  Why don't you catch Patrice up?  Why don't you catch, there's only two lines.  Yeah, you got to catch them up.  No, we can't.  Come on.  No, we can't.  This is, and this is for fun? 
[01:13:00]  Huh?  This is for fun?  You're going to let that get away from Patrice?  I know Norton's Jersey hack origins.  I know it.  I already know.  Well, it's his first TV appearance about 11 years ago.  Let's go right back to it.  It was Friday Night Videos in 96.  Yeah.  Here we go.  Was it Friday Night Videos?  Yeah, at Conan's studio.  They were doing them in New York.  Yeah.  And the problem, let's get back to my head.  The problem with it is it doesn't look good on me.  My father looks great.  He has a crew cut, the handsome, sturdy, military face.  Those women love my dad. 
[01:13:30]  That's where I screwed up.  They don't.  I don't have a handsome, sturdy, military type of face.  I have a little fat baby face.  It sucks.  I am not sexy.  A little crew cut, a little fat baby face.  I look like the bastard son of Sinead O'Connor and Uncle Fester.  Oh, I love when you put two people together as the bastard son of.  I know.  I don't have a handsome face.  I don't have a handsome face.  And after that set, you don't have a family or friends.  That voice should come in.  Ha, ha, ha. 
[01:14:00]  Ha.  Ha.  I could have changed that joke.  Now I should redo it.  Sinead O'Connor and Bob Kelly.  My dad was a handsome face.  I will emphasize this part of the joke.  And they didn't like my dad.  That was why.  I was just trying to get to my dad.  Yeah.  Did he drive you to this?  Did he drive you to this set and go, are you going to talk about me or something?  You did three jokes on your father already.  Keep talking.  I know.  You think I don't know?  Nervous.  I'll keep talking until something funny shows up. 
[01:14:30]  Chatter.  Idiots.  Am I an audience member?  After that set  You should be  No you did  They laughed  It wasn't even funny  You said I have a baby face  No but that's when you used to make facial expressions  For your punchlines  Little Play-Doh face  Bastard son  And who else 
[01:15:00]  Uncle Fesh  On crack  Thank you  Did you have your hand up  And he threw the mic down  Did they just go to silhouette  They did once for you  It was called an eclipse  You know what the sucks about it  Is that there's just no way out of them  I have to accept them  Because they're always going to be there 
[01:15:30]  Oh they're just quick and easy aren't they  Don't you undermine that like it's quick and easy  That was funny  That was very good  Come on Bobby  They're very good  That was the best thing to happen to life  If Bobby just became this little fat man  And it's always a quick  Because he has funny fat shape  He's just completely round  Like a little basketball  And it just  Went bald  There is a god  Bobby  Bobby used to look like 
[01:16:00]  Like he should have  Cigarettes rolled up in his sleeve  And just like smoke  And blow smoke rings  And it just fell apart  You should have a yoo-hoo  And a ham rolled up in your sleeves  Now Bobby looks like the last pick  It's like a little skinny girl  Or Bobby  All right we'll take him  You used to look like a movie star  Dude Bobby  First time I met Bobby  I'm like what that  Now he looks like a movie theater  I'm surprised you're not showing something on your face 
[01:16:30]  Now he has trouble just moving  It's just amazing to me  That he's so much fatter than me  But here's the difference  I know  I know the difference  You're four foot seven  You look like a staff holding accident  You're supposed to be fat  Yeah Patrice is supposed to be fat  You're not  That's the difference  Wait  It's just  Patrice is like big  You're like oh my god  Here he comes  You know what I mean  It's like you're very obvious  When you walk in the room 
[01:17:00]  Get serious  I get you  And punt  Exactly  All right let's go back to Norton  Let's go back to Norton's  First TV appearance  And then we can go back to talk about  How Voss just did a Larry Amaro  Yeah  From 1983  Bobby looks like a Tempur-Pedic pillow  How's it going  Perfect delivery too  Oh not too eager  Oh Jesus  You put your head on his back  We got it 
[01:17:30]  We got it  We got it  Very relaxed  He was very relaxed  With that delivery  It was perfect delivery  Like his outfit  Very relaxed  All right let's go  Here's Norton  First TV appearance  I look young too  Don't I  I hate that  I'm 27 years old  I look like a little boy  It's just 
[01:18:00]  The last woman that took me to bed  Tucked me in  Tucked me in  I know  I just want to stay home  And watch films  You want to see good movies  Forget the stuff that's out now  Watch the stuff from like the 1940s  Best movies ever done  Why?  Because they couldn't curse on camera  They couldn't  So they had to show like their anger and annoyance  By overacting  They were great movies  Watch one of them  Every time they get aggravated  They wouldn't curse  They would just go  I bet that was a good face 
[01:18:30]  That's kind of funny though  That's in the 40s  It's the 1990s  That is still the best thing to do in a bar  If a woman rejects you  It throws her right off track  Hey baby can I buy you a drink?  No  Hey baby can I buy you a drink?  Rats  Nice line  This isn't black and white  It had subtitles 
[01:19:00]  Hey baby can I buy you a drink?  But by the way  You can hear all of these  And many more jokes  This weekend in San Francisco  I will be redoing this material  Wow  Bringing it back  That's right  Hey baby  Rats  I like your delivery  I'm trying to think of what's changed about  What do you think changed about your thing now?  Well you mature as a performer  You're on stage every night  And you start to not feel good  Not completely being yourself  And there's a bitterness now 
[01:19:30]  Which is good  Yeah  It sounds like you  But it sounds like  A happy  It's a happy Jimmy  A happy Jimmy  But it wasn't a happy  It was a phony happy  I was coming out of that by that point  And it was like  It's just the energy  I thought I had to do something  To make the kids listen to that industry  Crap  Be likable  You have to be likable  Plus that TV show though  You couldn't have went on that TV show  Doing what you do now  I mean  You know  Now you can finally do your HBO specials  And do what you do  Back then you had to  You had to do that crap  Right  And plus there's a TV show 
[01:20:00]  You moved out of your parents house  I still lived to my parents  For three years after that  The way you talked  There was this whole  Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh  Well speaking of that  We gotta go to the phones  Chris in Florida has a good one  Chris what's up?  Uh, not much  I just wanted to say  Jimmy  Jimmy sounds like the rat  From the Lion King  I'm trying to make it  And Andrew from Toronto  Andrew  Jimmy I love you  But it sounds like  Someone's got their hand up your ass  While drinking a glass of milk  It was not a bad line 
[01:20:30]  He was basically  We're gonna get dumped out of that  Yeah, it's too bad  He was implying that I sound like a ventriloquist  Yeah, like a dummy  No, you look like the dummy  And then you sound like the guy  Oh  With that, let's go back  We can squeeze a little more in  Before the break here  It's great watching you just spin out of control  Believe it or not, I have had a lot of practice  Dealing with rejection  No, I have  You know why?  And don't pretend you didn't notice  You're a nice, polite crowd  I have a tiny little chin  Don't I?  Look at this  I hate it  I have the profile of a frog  I had a commercial audition today 
[01:21:00]  One line  Bud  I just hate it  Oh  At least you're doing topical humor  Genius  What?  They're laughing though  Norton  Norton would trash a comic  Sounding like that right now  Like  Yes  What do you think we're doing?  Praising it?  You know what?  But Norton has a fake  He's  He's really proud  Norton is very nostalgic about himself  He's really proud of this material  He knows we're going to trash him 
[01:21:30]  So he has his hand like  But he really is  He's listening  And enjoying this nonsense  Incorrect  Shut up  Don't say incorrect  I'll tell you why he's wrong  Incorrect  We all have that  When you look back  It's really embarrassing  I couldn't watch it  It's embarrassing  It's really embarrassing  I'd love to watch it  You had so much confidence  You went from no chin  To a little chin  In your set  Like all  You don't have to leave  Just relax  I love how Voss  Takes the headphones off  Like I'm taking myself out  I'll tell you why  This is not as embarrassing 
[01:22:00]  As it could be  Because years ago  We did my 93 tape  And that was humiliating  The 93 one  Where you rubbed your head  At least this one  I see where I'm like  Alright man  You're changing  I know what this is  It's developing  It's becoming what he is today  And we can't see him  That's  If we  Well we're going to put the video up  On onaradio.com  And all the websites  We need to see it too  Because this is just as bad  Norton  10 years ago  Is as bad  As a bad comic now  Like he's not as bad  Like I would see somebody like that  Saying this nonsense now 
[01:22:30]  Like I look like the frog  And you know  Bud  There's guys that would still do that  Oh  Yeah  You know what I mean  Like this is  He stinks  Visual too  We have to see how awful he is  We have to see you  And you're dumb  I was awful  On my interview  I hope they play the interview  Because that was really douchey  I was trying to be like  Very very  Oh I want to hear that  Oh we got the interview  I was trying to be charming  That's a little later  But let's get to the  You want it to be liked  So much  Desperately  So much  Let's get back to this  Jersey bum  I just hate my head 
[01:23:00]  I tried to grow a goatee  It slid off  It's not fair man  Even the elephant man  Had a chin  Alright granted  It was on the back of his head  That was a little laugh  You guys are going  It's okay to laugh  He's not here  And I'm sorry  But when your head  Is that big and fat  You deserve to stand in a cage  While British children  Throw pebbles at you  British kids were great  They were ruthless  Look at him he's got a big egg  Pow  Pow  I am not an animal 
[01:23:30]  Yeah well you know  Mel Gibson either  Pow  Well you know  Mel Gibson either  Let me tell you  Couldn't just be regular children  It would be English  You know Mel Gibson either  This was a begging  For some money sent  He was going to show  All his arsenal  I was  He does these impersonations  You think it's the real person  He does characters 
[01:24:00]  This was going to skyrocket you  To middle on the road  We could make him a paper boy  In the new movie  Extra extra  Let's go to John in Maine  John  Hey boys  I just wanted to know  Why we're watching  Simon Birch on the air  That's funny  People  A lot of people  On instant feedback  And this is what I'm getting too  The material  Isn't bad  Listen  Like there's some  Goatee slip  Made me damn laugh  I didn't want to laugh  Yeah  But they're saying  Your voice  And the way you're delivering  Your cadence 
[01:24:30]  And your voice  Is destroying  Any of the material  Of course it is  It's awful  You sound like  When you can have  Your computer  Read back your text  Have a goatee slip  Off your head  Wow  Wow  My dad was good looking  You sound like  Catherine Hepburn  Catherine Hepburn  That's what it is  Catherine Hepburn  When he says  You know Mel Gibson  I mean  You stupid old  There's a girl  Put you in a cage  And throw rocks at you  And then his dumb 
[01:25:00]  Non-confidence in his jokes  Because he thought  He went too much  Over the head  He had to give  18 different examples  Just to let him know  It's an elephant man joke  Y'all  You unsure boob  It was TV  I was scared  Unsure boob  It's okay to laugh  I am after every punchline  You get it?  Right?  Right?  Elephant man  Yeah  Alright we have to  We have to break  We got a Sports Illustrated  Swimsuit model  Coming in today  Fantastic  Yeah we got a very busy show

Are we going to be able to see that on TV?  Who knows?  C-SPAN should have it, right?  I'm hoping  Oh, yeah  I'm hoping  Mecca of excitement  Yeah, C-SPAN is a bore fest  But, you know  Just throw it on in the background  Until they get to the juicy stuff  And we have something we're doing today  Rich, we didn't tell you this  But 
[01:27:00]  Oh yeah, we got a little surprise for you  Just a little one  It's not a big deal  But we were always  We talked about the acting  And we didn't know you guys  Were actually going to be able  To have me and boss do it  But we're going to do a scene together  Oh, really?  An acting scene  And what do I do?  You pull up and I go  Are you going out tonight?  But no, we're going to have you do a scene  We're always goofing on Rich's acting and stuff  And Jimmy  Yes  You know  It would be fun to see you guys do a scene  A legitimate scene 
[01:27:30]  And try to, you know  I mean, I don't mind  It sounds like a lot of fun  But we don't have  It's not like I had time to prepare  Well, that's just it  I didn't look at it either  And it's pretty much the fact that  You guys are always talking about  When you get an audition  And you get a script  It's very hard to just do a cold read  Kind of a thing  I've never done a cold read  And I want to see that  Yeah, we wanted to see you guys  Try it off the cuff  I know what we're doing  I think it would be fun  I have an idea of what we're doing  Why not?  But I have not  I honestly have not looked at the script  I haven't  You know  I would tell you if I did  Rich, you're game, right?  I would do one  Do you hear his voice, homie? 
[01:28:00]  He's a little nervous  I know  That's his Achilles heel, dude  He can't act  He just can't  Did you hear him?  Yeah  He's a Achilles torso  Poor guy  He just can't act  Yeah, well, we're gonna  I'm sorry  And I love  I'm just saying it from a loving place  He just cannot act  Oh, really?  Turn on American Dreams  And watch me play Lenny Bruce  Dude, they walked you through that  I know 
[01:28:30]  You played a green  There was a guy in a green  Rich was  Let me tell you something  Rich was CGI'd on there  He did that in a studio  And then they just  Plasted it on there  When they probably said  Look, how many more  How many more takes do we need?  It's the same technology they do  To make a dog talk on TV  Rich, you're gonna take that  It's pretty good stuff  They did that  The dancing Ally McBeal baby 
[01:29:00]  With Moss  He didn't spend money on the computer animation  They just put some peanut butter  On the roof of his mouth  And as he moved his mouth  They dubbed in the words  To me  Do Lenny Bruce  Wilbur  I'm done  All right  What are you gonna do?  We need  Hold on, Rich  We need two microphones  Two standing mics  Yeah  In the middle of that  In the room  I want two mics in stands  If we have them  Two of them  Can I print it out  So I can see it  Because I don't have glasses  Oh, God, listen to him  That's not a bad idea  Do we have the scene yet?  You do get  When you go into a room  You do get 
[01:29:30]  At least a couple seconds  Do you get a couple of minutes  Yeah, you get a couple seconds  To look it over  What are we gonna do?  Like some kind of what?  What kind of  We need like a man's man movie  We got  It was one of a couple things  It was either gonna be  A Bronx Tale  Or Goodfellas  Or possibly Raging Bull  Like they took a scene  From one of those films  Oh, we can play Raging Bull  And they already have it  Printed out  How about Children of a Lesser God  So he doesn't have to talk  No  My left foot  No, I'm in my left  How about the Stephen Hawking story? 
[01:30:00]  If Dummy did my left foot  He'd move the right one  Oh, gosh  You guys will act like  You're Oscar actors  We have a sense of acting skill  I was like to say  You played a gay doorman once  Yeah  That's pretty good  I mean, he's a  He's got to keep the code  Patrice is convincing  Patrice is a good actor  I saw him in the office there 
[01:30:30]  In the warehouse scene  He's a pretty good actor  Angry black guy  Put that disgusting face on  And he's looking at the white guy  Angry black guy  Bobby doesn't even have to audition  Bobby just gets on a scale  And they go  You're right  Voss can't cold read him  Can we stop for a second?  First of all  Why?  Voss  Why?  You're playing the big guy  I'm a way better actor than you  Bobby can act  Way better  I've been off Broadway in Boston  Stupid  You are Broadway in Boston  Okay, there you go  I threw that out  You swung and hit it  I didn't say you're not funny 
[01:31:00]  You just can't act  I'm a comic  I'm a comic  Okay  That seems debatable  Okay  Give Voss a scene  So he can prepare  We're going to do that  In about 15-20 minutes  Alright  Which one do you want to do?  Rich  We have three copies  Of the same one  Okay  Okay  Let me see one  Voss will play  Of course  He's going to play  I would do this  From Cologio  And this  Wait, that's going to be mine  And these  We're going to do a scene between 
[01:31:30]  Apparently  I want to follow along  Apparently  We're going to have other scripts out too  For the guys  We got one for Anthony  I'll be on  Oh, I would love one  And we got it  Oh, we got it for Bobby and Patrice too  Okay  They're coming  There's two right here  So what?  It's a scene from  Bronx Tale  Oh, okay  Where  I'm Caligula  Caligula  Caligula  This is why you would not get the audition  I saw this movie  I'm Coolio  Coolio  I'm Coolio  I'm Coolio 
[01:32:00]  Now, but I think that  Wait a minute  I think that Johnny is  I'm guessing that's Sonny  I think that he probably just changed the name  Yeah  Is that true, right?  Yeah  This is the original script  Oh, okay  Alright, so  But wait, who am I?  Boss is playing who?  Which one is highlighted on yours?  Your Coligio  Yeah, it's highlighted  The scene is highlighted  Who am I?  Which one am I?  Your number 46  The page number on the corner  Exactly  46  Oh, I don't read that?  No, he wouldn't even get that right  Alright, very cool 
[01:32:30]  40 plus 6  Well, why don't you go sit and practice there, Boss?  I don't like how cocky you are  Yeah, we're going to do this scene in about 15 minutes  I have to practice and you don't  Listen, we got another great story we got to get to today  A high school teacher  A lot of teachers listen to this show as they go to school there  And teach the brats out there  Well, there's a high school teacher making the news  Who couldn't read, write, or spell  Now, how the hell did they get away with that?  I don't know  We're going to find out here  John Corcoran has a high school diploma 
[01:33:00]  A college degree  And even taught high school students for nearly two decades  His achievements are nothing out of the ordinary  But what sets him apart  Is that he accomplished all this  Without the ability to read or write  I can remember when I was eight years old  Saying my prayers at night  Saying, please God, tomorrow  When it's my turn to read  Please let me read  You just pretend like you're invisible  And when the teacher says, Johnny, read 
[01:33:30]  You just wait that teacher out  So he couldn't read  How do you  But not explaining how he became a teacher  By not knowing how to read or write  Or spell  Yeah, how do you then become a teacher  And then hold down a job as a teacher  I cheated in every one of my classes  He graduated with a bachelor's degree in education  There's the guy who gets a bachelor's degree  Ironically, Corcoran's next decision 
[01:34:00]  Landed him back in the classroom  He got a job during a teacher shortage  They gave almost all the college graduates in education a job  For 17 years, Corcoran taught high school  For the Oceanside School District  He relied on teacher's assistance for help  And oral lesson plans  But at the age of 48, a change of heart  It's embarrassing for me  And it's embarrassing for this nation  John Corcoran studied and worked with a tutor here  At the Carlsbad City Library 
[01:34:30]  Within a year, he was able to read and write  At a sixth grade level  What is going, what, how  How did he get through college?  Yeah  This doesn't make any sense  We need more info  Did he have people writing the papers for him?  Like, how did he, like, read the questions on the test?  He said he cheated  Alright, fine  How did he cheat, though?  If he can't read, write, or spell?  Yeah  And then he's a teacher  And then he's a teacher  And no one is suspicious that he's using teacher, you know, aids and stuff 
[01:35:00]  And what, oral  He said something like  He just handed out, like, oral subjects  Yeah  Like people had to answer  Get up in front of the class  And just say their report  How did he know to give him an A, B, C, or D?  What, he gave him smiley faces?  What does this mean?  I got a cue  You got a cue  Right 
[01:35:30]  How did I do?  I gave you an upside-down boomerang with a line to it  Right, right  Oh, my God  Everyone's getting their test back  And they're going around the room  I got a unicorn sticker  What does that mean?  What is a mushroom?  Right  A fingerprint  I got three fingerprints and a rainbow  What is this?  Oh, my God  How did he give you a scrub grade?  Corcoran is now an education advocate  His goal is to create a bridge to literacy 
[01:36:00]  If we would just teach our people how to read and write and spell  We would give him a fair chance  A chance he hopes to give to others by sharing his amazing story  Cheating  We got someone from Nevada  Don't be so shocked  Rich Voss became a comedian and he's not funny  All right, whatever  Whatever  Voss is in the bathroom right now  Yeah  With his lines  He's practicing 
[01:36:30]  Is he actually saying them?  He didn't want to say them in here  So now he's going to go  He just called Bonnie  He's doing them over the  Why is he freaking out?  Bonnie Reed with me  It's just us too  It's just because we goof on  We goof on him so much about his acting  We goof on me about my acting too  Yeah  They called me in Lucky Louie  I was silent film acting  I get to do it from that  I love you  At the end of every one of your little scenes  It was a facial expression  Why Rich?

I think the  people that have been with us for a long time know  when Daniela  the Sports Illustrated  swimsuit model came in and  she said she was from Rio. When these guys  jumped right into talking in  Portuguese, that was the funniest moment  on the fucking show. Because they were talking hooker  talk within an 11. 
[02:17:00]  That's in Sports Illustrated.  It was only hooker talk.  All hooker talk.  I thought you were talking Brazilian.  What kind of shit were you saying?  That was the funniest moment on the show.  How old are you? How much it cost?  That's too expensive.  What favela are you from?  Josinia or Vigigal?  What is that?  That's the pride of the slums.  We were asking a hooker question. Helpy?  I don't even know if people...  Monte Carlo?  Mia Pataka? 
[02:17:30]  She pretended like she didn't know, but girls from  Rio who aren't hookers  hate hookers.  Oh shit. That was hilarious.  These guys didn't even like...  There wasn't even a space between  her saying Rio de Janeiro  and you guys jumping right.  No, they just went off.  Oh, that was really fun.  Tutu Ben?  Baby, you have to know the most important one.  Right when she's done,  Janada, thank you.  Oh no.  And then Vi.  Vi is go.  Vi.  And then Patrice goes, 
[02:18:00]  I was going to take a sharpie  and write 150 on her palm.  What's that about?  You'd write a finger  and you write  how much  with your finger  on her palm.  Like it said.  And you just write,  she goes,  two,  and you go,  mm-mm.  And then you just write 150  on her palm.  And then she takes an eraser,  which is her other finger,  and erases that.  That's a computer in Brazil.  And then you go,  okay.  Then you go,  170,  and then she goes,  okay,  okay.  Wow.  Yeah.  And then the Sheraton LeBlanc, 
[02:18:30]  that's where it was saved.  Well, the Othorn.  What was that place?  The Monte Carlo?  Is that what it was called?  The one with the lockers?  Are you staying in apartmenta  or hotel?  I'm in an hotel.  Hotel.  That was the...  Apartmenta  or hotel?  I swear to God,  you give those girls  like your little sundries  in the bathroom,  the free little soaps.  It's like taking them shopping.  I swear to God,  little shampoos.  Fucking guys.  The last time I went, 
[02:19:00]  I went with my girl,  which was the second favorite time ever.  The first favorite was  when we all went.  The first time with Jason and him?  It was one when Norton was so funny.  It was the funniest time.  I laugh harder  than I ever laughed in my life.  It was just great time.  That was a great day.  With Evan,  it was me,  you,  Evan,  Jason,  I want to say Bobby,  and Richard.  Voss is there.  No, no, no.  Bobby was there.  Voss' time,  I hate to say it,  but that was the first time, 
[02:19:30]  but Voss wasn't,  Voss hated it.  And Voss wasn't doing  what we were doing.  He was like,  Voss didn't,  Are there any golf courses  around here?  He wasn't fun.  He's not a,  he's not a fun guy like that.  I gotta stop.  Like that.  I gotta stop the show  because they're acknowledging it.  It has to be acknowledged.  New funniest moment.  Voss said,  I thought you were speaking Brazilian.  Yeah.  After I said that.  Yeah.  He's not even better.  It's like a dog chewing your sock.  When I said they were  speaking Portuguese,  you said, 
[02:20:00]  I thought they were  speaking Brazilian.  Oh, no.  We gotta stop the show  and acknowledge that  because people cannot believe  you said that in Voss.  You just weren't fun  on that level.  I was on that level.  Yeah.  We smashed Norton  because he wouldn't come out  until the sun went down.  Remember he was showing.  Oh, he,  and then Norton was falling in love.  That was the greatest part  of the world.  Oh, really?  He got dumped by a hooker.  And we laughed at him.  We saw a hooker 
[02:20:30]  give her money back.  I know.  She said you look like  a cross between  Sinead O'Connor,  Sinead O'Connor,  you fucking D,  D leaving out,  you ummy.  She gave me an extra.  And girls who don't do it,  she,  that,  that model was annoyed  that we would do it.  She would,  she just knows how to be.  Oh, of course.  Yeah, she's got it.  But she was annoyed  when we went into hooker talk.  We're like typical guys too.  We suck.  Cause she's like an 11.  She's in the Sports Illustrated  swimsuit issue.  As soon as we sat down here  before we went on the air, 
[02:21:00]  we're like,  you know what?  She wasn't that great.  She's not that great.  When she sat down,  her ass kind of pushed out  a little too much.  She had,  she was wearing pants  that like,  her ass didn't look good at all.  It looks,  but there was bad pants.  She models swimsuits.  She's used to being  almost naked.  She had a beautiful  kissable face.  That's what I liked  is her face was very pretty.  I don't know.  She had the boots.  She looked like she just got  like done from a horse race.  Yeah,  she was in riding gear.  I thought she was okay, 
[02:21:30]  fella.  She didn't,  and put it this way,  not that she wasn't beautiful.  She just didn't do anything.  That little piece of garbage  that comes in here  and shows some of her cheek.  She does it more,  for me,  more than that girl.  Who?  The little Brazilian thing  that will come in here  from time to time?  She hasn't been here  in a while.  Who,  Master Poe?  She didn't do anything  for you though,  right?  She goes on Pal Talk,  Patrice.  You don't see her  on Pal Talk, 
[02:22:00]  the little Brazilian girl  that comes in here?  I don't see her.  Yeah,  she's on there sometimes.  She did something better.  I mean,  I don't want to sound  like I'm crazy,  but it's like a friend of mine  we always go,  and he goes,  would you fuck it?  I go,  that has nothing to do with it.  It has nothing to do with it.  She was...  Wait,  so what was wrong  with that girl then?  She didn't have a good ass.  She didn't have a good ass.  She was a bore.  She was all right.  She can barely speak English.  Let me tell you,  she's going to be a bore.  But she was a bore.  No, no, no.  Don't try to be on 
[02:22:30]  Portuguese radio.  She was a bore attitude.  I thought she had  a great little ass,  but the pants,  because there was a couple  of places where she was  standing where the pants  were bad,  but if she wore something  that was highlighting  her little tight ass,  she has a small little butt,  man,  because she's a fucking model.  Combined,  we don't make a 10,  and we're just  trashing this lady.  A big actor like me.  That's what guys do.  You got to pick them apart.  The girls at the cellar last night.  There were two girls there  that were...  She's from Brazil.  That blonde last night.  You saw her in a big,  loose sweater.  Can you imagine her  in a fucking sexy little...  You don't have to imagine. 
[02:23:00]  Where's the fucking magazine?  Oh, I don't know.  You can look and see.  Where's my swimsuit issue?  I've seen better girls  in a Rocco Sinfretti.  Where's the magazine?  Do we have one?  Yeah, Nasty.  That's it, Nasty.  She doesn't have good...  If you find one,  open up the page  and see what she looks like  in a bikini.  Oh, she's amazing  in the magazine,  but she didn't get  good placement.  She's in between  like a car ad  and like cologne.  She's not the cover girl, huh?  She's not in the main section  where it's like  one model after another.  She's kind of tucked  in the middle somewhere.  I wonder if the fucking car ads  have a say  on who they want to be next to 
[02:23:30]  because the hot chick people  will look at her longer  so we want her ad right there.  This whole page is her?  Every second.  Is that her?  That whole thing is her?  Daniela, let me see.  Oh, wow.  We didn't see those earlier.  All right.  First thing,  they don't have an ass shot.  No.  They don't have an ass shot,  which leads me to believe  that's not her strong suit.  It's very small.  She's small.  Hey...  No, no.  Let me see.  The...  No, she's very... 
[02:24:00]  I don't know.  I'm not digging it.  This picture's nice.  She's not showing anything  and her face is kind of cute,  but...  The one on the cover  is ten times better.  The one on the cover is...  That's her.  Well, that's why she's on the cover.  She's not on the cover,  you moron.  It's not her on the cover.  The one on the cover.  We're not going to get  the one from the cover.  Look at us.  I think she's a very beautiful girl.  We have a chance  for the inside ones.  Look at how nice...  They gave us the ugly one.  You guys out of your mind.  Look at how nice  that fucking fat teardrop titty is.  Can I say that?  That fucking beautiful thigh. 
[02:24:30]  She's just a beautiful girl.  I mean,  she's not filthy.  No one's saying she's not beautiful.  We were just talking about  on the level  of a beautiful woman.  Yeah, if you saw her  in Brazil...  I think she's a low-level  beautiful woman.  Yeah, they gave us the...  Low-level beautiful?  They gave us the ugly one  out of the crop.  But if you saw her...  Well, one of them  has to be officially ugly  in that category.  If you saw her in Brazil  walking to club help,  it'd be like...  We'd be all...  No, we wouldn't.  No, we wouldn't.  Bobby wouldn't even  put his sandwich down.  Hey, I...  Oh, shit.  The guys pulled the clip.  Listen, I want to replay 
[02:25:00]  because it's worth it.  So this swimsuit model  comes in  and she says she's from Rio  and these guys just start  in with their hooker talk.  Listen again.  Where in Brazil are you from?  I'm from Rio, the janeiro.  No!  What's up?  Look at this.  Oh!  Mia Pataka, baby!  Mia Pataka!  Mia Pataka!  Help me!  Help me!  Hey!  Tutu Ben!  Tutu Ben!  Quantos Anos!  Yes!  Quanto custo?  Multicaro!  No quanto me a tos!  Obrigato!  Obrigato! 
[02:25:30]  Obrigato!  Je nada!  Je nada!  Je nada!  Descupe, por favor!  Bobby, Brazil!  Bobby, no USA!  Sheraton LeBlanc, please!  That's the cab driver.  Cab driver.  What are you guys doing?  It's a beat.  And she knew it was hooker talker.  That's all you can say.  Hooker talker.  I was wondering, because she barely said anything.  She was just kind of sitting there uncomfortably listening to you guys.  As soon as she heard help, she, you know. 
[02:26:00]  Mati Carlo.  That's the big club, right?  That's a fucking whorehouse.  Everybody knows.  You go all the way to Brazil for helpy?  What else?  Exactly.  The seashells, bitch?  Yeah, what do you think?  The educational opportunity for the chicken liver to get my throat cut for $3?  Who the fuck gets on an 11-hour flight?  What the hell was that?  That's Ross's dead inside.  Ross is acting again.  That's his kidney that just died.  What's wrong with her ass?  There's nothing wrong with it.  Look what I'm saying.  Look, there's her ass right there.  It's like so hard.  That's her?  Yeah.  She's the one that was here. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  All right, let me see.  I didn't see.  Oh, yeah.  Show me.  They didn't give me one page.  You should pass it around.  Show that juicy rump.  Voss's sister's what?  The size of a baseball we're up to?  Yeah.  Jesus.  You getting it removed soon or what?  Yeah, hopefully.  I'm waiting to see.  Get Clemens to sign it.  I liked it.  Thanks, Hope.  I really did.  And Patrice was asking earlier, off mic, if Roger Clemens did the Roys.  Of course he did at this point.  You got to think he was on the juice. 
[02:27:00]  His wife was on the juice.  And you know what?  I think he's the type of father, too.  He wants his sons in the major leagues.  I think his sons were probably on the juice already, too.  Why would his wife be on it?  What, is she an athlete, too?  She was in one of these swimsuit issues, and she wanted to look good.  So, supposedly, according to Brian McNamee, they popped some juice in her to make her look better.  How quick does it work?  He's going down kicking and screaming.  Clemens?  He is not going out.  He's just...  Wouldn't he try to bury this and do all these press conferences and stuff?  He doesn't want to do it, dude.  What sucks is... 
[02:27:30]  He wants the Hall of Fame.  What sucks is Pettit.  Pettit agreeing with everything McNamee said.  That's bad because...  Because he's a Christian.  He can't lie.  He loves what he doesn't want to under oath either.  He can't lie in a fucking subpoena, man.  So bad.  No, he could be brought up on perjury.  Clemens is looking like...  I know.  I'm looking over there.  He's got a huge, giant head.  Looks like Christopher Reeve's hair.  Yes!  That's what I was going to say.  Christopher Reeve before he started rotting away.  Like when they first put him in the chair.  But the sportscasters, this is the one thing that makes me go, okay, the convincing argument. 
[02:28:00]  Because I'm sitting there going, if somebody accuses me of something, I say I didn't do it.  You know, I'm going to fight if I didn't.  But people go, nobody gets better at 40.  Right.  Like, that is an argument that just goes, you go, wow.  No one statistically gets better at 40.  No.  No one continues physically to compete with 20-year-olds at the age of 40.  You can survive and you can have a spark of your greatness.  And like you said, having gotten better, it just doesn't happen. 
[02:28:30]  No, like Nolan Ryan...  Cy Young's at 39.  Cy Young, the best pitchers, you got that Johan Santana motherfucker, you got all these  Puerto Ricans who just throw 150 miles an hour and Clemens is better than all of them?  Yeah, how does that work?  At 40.  Like, you just don't get better at anything at 40.  And he comes in like half a year, doesn't even have any, doesn't train anything like  the other guys, comes in and just starts pitching lights out.  Just right out.  Boom.  A month, and then he's in, and then he's pitching 100 miles an hour. 
[02:29:00]  Who's shitting him?  How are they going to have proof?  Garbage, he said, you know...  But that's just it, we're arguing the point.  Why this motherfucker saved blood in the garbage can?  He's the worst.  We're arguing the point, but he is a piece of shit.  All they gotta do is deny it.  He should take a fastball to the face.  All they gotta do is deny it.  They're gonna test his blood.  Doesn't matter.  They can't even prove that they...  As long as they deny it.  It's not evidence that was scooped up by the police department and it's not tainted.  There's no way anything like that could hold up.  The guy could say, I got it.  Check it.  It's got his DNA on it. 
[02:29:30]  It's got steroids on it.  But, what the fuck does that mean?  The defense is blood and put stuff in it.  Of course, the defense is hard to say, why would you save a piece of a needle that you  injected a plant with?  Why would you save that unless you planned on commercially profiting from this?  Yeah.  You planned on doing something with this.  Right.  Clemens is...  Yeah, he's gonna be alright through this whole thing.  I think he's gonna be exonerated, but...  But most people are gonna be like, he did it.  He did it.  Come on.  He is not gonna...  But whatever.  Even if he did, who gives a shit?  Yeah.  Who cares?  Do you care about steroids? 
[02:30:00]  Absolutely not.  No.  I think there's...  I'd say it's an exhibition.  I don't know these people.  They're great.  I love the fact they hit 800 foot homers now.  Thank you.  And throw 135 miles an hour.  A lot of them do with the heel, though.  I mean, they get hurt and they need to heel quick.  So they'll pop roids.  Like, UFC guys have to take some roids to heel, because they get hurt all the time.  You know.  So, of course, you should let them take...  Ah!  Ah!  I'm gonna pop roids around.  He broke my knee, man.  What'd you take?  Hemorrhoids before you...  I broke my... 
[02:30:30]  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  Where's that clip?  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, dude.  That song was great, wasn't it?  That was the funniest thing I...  The greatest sound is your moan.  You didn't take any medicine?  They gave me...  That's great.  They gave me, what, Taco Bell and...  They gave me...  That's when Bobby did blow up, too, man.  That fucking... 
[02:31:00]  Oh, after the knee thing, right?  That fucking knee thing.  I only started working out in the last month my brand new ACL from a 40-year-old white guy.  But, yeah, they just drained my knee and they gave me...  What's that?  Cortisone?  Cortisone.  That's it.  That's it.  Damn, man.  Fuck.  Fuck that.  Bobby brought, like, fucking Nell Carter from Give Me a Brace.  I know.  Poor Bobby, man.  I actually was fat.  You gave Dane Cook your blood and your knee.  I know.  And he...  That motherfucker... 
[02:31:30]  You should be his Robin.  You should be on every...  And I mean Batman Robin.  You should just be everywhere with that fucker.  You gave your soul for that goddamn show.  Yep.  And what do you get out of it?  Classic!  Just...  Just...  Bad cholesterol is what you get out of it.  He's put me in every movie he's done.  Has he?  He hasn't put me in the fucker.  I don't know.  How about this?  I'm in the new one coming out and he tried to put you in the movie.  I understand.  I was horrendous.  And I knew I was horrendous.  He did try.  Yeah.  What do you mean at the audition?  What you just did with Chaz, I really thought it was De Niro. 
[02:32:00]  What did you audition for?  When you put me in the movie, like Kevin Smith just put me in the movie.  Yeah, you can do the scene.  You can do it.  I got the job done.  You know what?  You're right about it.  Because the first...  Good luck, Chuck.  They just put me in and it was easy.  It was fine.  The next one where you had to audition, it actually does make it a little harder.  It wasn't a good audition because this woman was just putting me on tape.  She wasn't giving me a read.  Okay, well, there we go.  And it's like, you know what?  You fucking suck, bitch.  But it doesn't fucking matter.  Who the fuck actually books a show? 
[02:32:30]  Who wins a role?  Yeah, you have one.  Like, who the fuck really out-acts everybody?  You just...  Whoever goes against you in a Chris Rock show.  I don't get it.  Everybody loves Chris.  H. Chris.  Oh, yeah.  But that's the point.  You heard that motherfucker get on the radio and say, I got the part.  You were the best.  But it's like, hey, you don't like his attitude.  You're hard to work with.  I'm not hard to work with, fuckface.  No one's ever said that.  I just did.  And I just did.  We all had it.  It's easy to work with. 
[02:33:00]  You work with me.  You work with me for fucking four, you asshole.  See how hard you are?  It's okay, man.  That's why you're hard to work with.  You can't.  White people, that's your problem.  We can't be angry.  The word you're looking for is uppity.  Uppity niggas.  Why can't I be uppity?  I've heard him called that.  I think you're fun to work with.  Shut your mouth.  Stop backtracking, you fucking Weasleys.  You're friends.  You disagree with me.  I don't.  He's not a producer.  He's like, I'm yelling now. 
[02:33:30]  He had a show.  He wouldn't put you in it.  Let me calm Patrice down.  He's the scary black guy.  I'm just kidding.  You're fun.  Shut up.  He's not fun.  He's very funny and we tolerate him because he's hilariously funny.  But he's not fun.  None of us are fun.  No, he's not a fun guy.  He's brilliantly funny, wrapped in shit.  Who's actually fun in this room?  We're the worst friends ever.  I don't know.  It's just, you know.  I don't know about that.  We're very honest with each other.  We don't fucking soft-sup things. 
[02:34:00]  I know exactly how you feel about most things I'm doing at any given moment.  And the same with Bobby.  I get honest opinions from these guys.  I think we're actually really good friends in that we don't fucking soft-sup each other.  Stereotypically, we're the shittiest friends on the planet.  It's just that we're not allowed to have square friends.  No, we call each other out on bullshit.  We save each other the trouble and embarrassment of humiliating ourselves in front of the audience.  We're great friends like that.  But stereotypically, I mean, like, you know, for birthdays.  We're not good square friends.  For my wedding.  Yeah.  We don't want to bring that up.  Why don't I give you a gift? 
[02:34:30]  Nobody.  You even call me and say congratulations.  Don't bring up weddings.  But that's why Bobby did what he did is because of how we are as friends.  No one would have an internet wedding who had good friends.  Yeah, exactly.  True.  They'd all be there.  Actually, I said to my girl, I go, look, this is what we're going to do.  Your family, we're going away.  I'm not inviting anybody because I don't want to get disappointed.  We'd all come.  We all would have come to your dumb wedding.  Who's going to fly to Hawaii? 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, Hawaii's different.  But if he did it in New York?  Oh, yeah, New York.  We're not going to do it in New York.  He didn't want to.  He didn't want to.  If he did it where we all could just ride through the Holland Tunnel to get there, of  course we'd fucking be there.  Hey, Bob, have your wedding on 42nd Street.  And I'll be there.  Have your wedding here.  Have your wedding.  If you can have it at Caroline's.  Have your wedding in this time zone.  Oh, look who's talking.  Fucking Saskatchewan motherfucker.  Yeah.  Canada.  This bitch ass nigga didn't invite nobody.  I did.  And then he came back and he wanted traditional wedding shit. 
[02:35:30]  He wanted gifts and shit.  No bullshit.  But he didn't invite me like a friend, but he wanted all the other friend shit.  You're wrong.  Don't make me get into this again.  Because the wedding party we threw, I was conveniencing you guys and not making you fly all the way  Fuck you and your giant cupcakes.  He had four wedding receptions hoping that we'd go to one.  It was awful.  It was fucking awful.  Did he have one in LA, one in New York, one else?  He had benefit receptions.  He lost me at I was conveniencing you guys. 
[02:36:00]  His reception was a text write-off.  There wasn't even a cake.  There was cupcakes.  Giant cupcakes.  You guys are at a comedy club and it gets mad that we didn't go.  I didn't.  I thought it was just another fucking set.  Okay, we paid a lot.  My mistake was doing it there.  My mistake.  Caroline charged you?  I paid seven, eight grand there.  To Caroline?  Yeah.  What?  I'm not fucking lying.  But here's the thing.  The problem.  We sent out real invitations.  And had a mill at the same time.  He had to keep running in from his own wedding. 
[02:36:30]  You guys ready for your next act?  You invited Norton.  He was your best man and you didn't invite anybody else.  I didn't want you guys to fly.  It was in Edmonton.  Am I not a good friend?  Yes, you were a great friend.  You really are.  Ooh.  And you know what?  And I didn't even expect him.  I said, if you can't do it, that's okay.  I said that.  I fucking flew.  It was a nine hour flight total because of the three hour layover in Minneapolis airport.  I hated your guts.  And I flew up.  But it was fucking shut up.  This shitty part of Canada.  It was in a fucking hunting lodge. 
[02:37:00]  There's people with fucking blood and gun extroverts.  Was it a rest area or something like that?  That's where the wedding photos were taken.  Right.  Someone's fucking, someone's blowing a Canadian trucker and he's smiling for photos.  I guess someone is telling a story right now.  I think Bobby did it the best way for how awful we are.  Who sent you a wedding gift?  He saved us all the embarrassment of having to make excuses.  Bobby, who sent you a wedding gift and said good luck on your wedding?  Yeah, you actually sent me a gift.  I'll get you a gift, I'm sorry. 
[02:37:30]  But the thing you, the way you sent me a gift was a little, it was a little shitty too.  No.  I had a card.  Let me just say it.  I'll tell you.  I'll tell you.  And then I'll tell the story.  All right, let me tell you.  All right.  He had a, he got me a card and put a hundred dollars in it.  Two hundred.  Was it two?  Two hundred, okay.  All right, I just wanted to see if you remember.  Maybe you just stopped to get some meat on the way home.  Sonny Black on his wedding?  A friend of ours.  Shut up.  He gave me a card.  We were supposed to do this gig together over at the Hudson.  I think it's, was it the, no, the Beacon.  Yeah, that Beacon.  The Dennis Leary thing.  Sure.  I was making a movie with Ricky Gervais, whatever, over on the east side. 
[02:38:00]  So I had to, I didn't know if they'd let me out.  So I had to cancel.  Okay.  Wow.  You could have been in two places at once.  Hang on one second.  So then at the last minute they released us.  So I jumped into cab, ran across town, just to show up to see if I could get there.  I didn't know he had a gift for me.  He was all nervous.  He's like, listen, I got to tell you something.  I brought you a gift.  So what happened, when he found out when I wasn't on the show, I canceled, he opened  the card.  All right, let me explain it. 
[02:38:30]  Took the money out and put it back in his pocket.  Okay.  So he gave, he had to put the money back in.  Gave me a card that he ripped open.  All right, let me finish.  He could just leave the 200 in there.  He had to have it in his pocket.  Okay, now, but wait a second.  Here's the thing.  Here's the thing.  I had the card.  I had the card.  Right.  And I had a check written out to Bobby at home.  Right.  I forgot the check.  Right.  Okay, I forgot.  So I said, I'll put 200 cash in.  Right.  When he gets you, I'll give him that.  Right.  They said he wasn't coming.  Right. 
[02:39:00]  So I opened the card and put the 200 back in my pocket.  And when I saw him, I was going to give him the check.  No big deal.  All of a sudden, he walks in.  All right?  So I just put it back in the card.  I did give you credit.  I did give you credit.  He really, he bought me a card.  But I have to say, and I would have to say that your wife.  Yeah, I was.  Like me, too.  I mean, your girl kind of, you know, hey, it's your mother's birthday.  All right.  All right.  I didn't even know.  You know, maybe you should give him a card.  No, but I said I'm getting Bobby.  And right before you got married, he left you a message. 
[02:39:30]  Good luck.  Because I'm a classy guy.  You're very classy.  You're not classy.  Very classy.  Classy with the ripped open envelope and the 200 taken out.  Exactly.  That's a class move, all right.  I did send out invitations to everybody.  I did make it easy.  If you want to see it, you can.  If you don't, you don't.  That is a genius thing that he did.  So you can watch it?  For people like us.  Right.  Like for what we are.  But not one of you.  I couldn't get a lie.  Not one of you called me or sent me a fucking email.  Because we don't fucking care.  I didn't want a gift. 
[02:40:00]  But you knew that, Bobby.  No, I wasn't even like Voss.  I didn't want a gift.  I didn't invite you to a party saying bring shit.  I didn't do all of them.  Not even.  You just wanted an acknowledgement from one of your friends that you were getting married.  Not even a fucking dude.  Congratulations.  Everybody in the circle is a self-centered piece of garbage.  You're right.  He didn't.  I did.  Bobby, because he's been going to psychologists, is becoming the most like trying to be a regular 
[02:40:30]  guy friend.  He's becoming the most deluded into thinking he's not shit.  Every time Bobby talks, he thinks he's in group therapy.  My therapist actually said that I don't have friends.  You don't.  I don't.  I don't have a fucking friend.  You know Gavin.  Gavin had, last year Gavin had to actually learn how to be a fucked up person.  Because I can go like this.  This is how you can go in this whole fucking circle.  Not talk to each other for six months.  Not see each other. 
[02:41:00]  Not talk nothing.  And then bump into somebody and go, what are you doing, stupid?  Like, that's our relationship.  Not like, where you been for half a year?  No, that's true.  Friendship.  We're used to fucking being on the road.  Like, I'm used to where you're going to be.  I'll be in San Francisco this weekend.  You're going to be in Rhode Island.  We're used to all of a sudden.  Gavin couldn't understand how you could not talk to a friend for every day.  Every day.  Yeah, but Gavin would show.  You know, your buddy.  Like, hey, what you doing?  Like, I don't even know how.  Like, what do friends do? 
[02:41:30]  He has no clue about friendships.  You know, what the fuck do you do with a friend?  I don't talk to my neighbors.  When they try to talk, you just go, what the fuck?  You know what you do with friends?  And I only know from, like, years ago, old high school friends that, you know, kind of  carried over into the working world.  You just pretty much hang out and drink.  That's, like, the only thing you can really do with your friends.  No, you can give them a ride somewhere and do something. 
[02:42:00]  What?  That's inconvenient.  That's inconvenient.  Help them move, I'm saying.  No fucking way.  Are you insane?  I moved.  Yep.  Bobby moved.  Yep.  No one moved.  I moved.  Not once.  Not once did I think about calling any of them to help me do shit.  And you know who does that?  Not unfunny comics.  Yeah.  Help each other.  Unfunny comics will help each other.  And hey, we'll all come over.  They'll have a party.  Yeah, give massages.  One girl comic will.  Go fuck yourself.  Did you even think of asking anybody to help you move a fucking couch? 
[02:42:30]  Hell no.  No.  Hell no.  I can explain, by the way, why we are this way with each other.  One of the reasons is because a lot of times friends use each other to divert from  the awfulness of their life.  We like our lives.  I love what I do.  I'm here for five hours a day.  We're all on the road doing gigs, having fun.  We all know the other guys are pretty much doing fucking acting, having fun.  It's like we don't need to divert from our lives, and all of our friends are involved  in our work lives.  Yeah, but that's elaborate what he said.  No, I got three kids.  You really can't compare that to, dude, can you help me move this couch? 
[02:43:00]  No.  I have nobody to help me move a couch.  See, I have an excuse.  I have three kids.  Hey, Norton.  What you doing, buddy?  Listen.  And then don't start with what you're doing first, because then it's like you're not going  to get an answer.  Like, hey, Bob, what you doing?  What?  What?  What do you mean?  Yeah, why?  What's going on?  What are you doing?  Why need you help me move this couch?  Nah, I'm on the moon, dude.  Hey, hey, hey.  I am the moon.  I got to stop right here.  We got Bob Saget on the line.  Bobby! 
[02:43:30]  Hey, how you doing?  Pretty good.  What's going on?  You got Patrice O'Neill, of course, Jim Norton, Bob Kelly, and Rich Voss in studio today.  Oh, man.  I miss you guys.  I wish I was there, because it's snowing, right?  Yeah.  Yes.  Now it's just a messy rain.  Rain.  That's what I want.  Yeah.  You have real friends, Bob?  What?  You have real true...  Like, you have any friends left from, like, real life, or all comedy friends?  No, no.  Real life, but not as many as I used to have.  When I moved to Hollywood from a single apartment in Palms to Hollywood, my moving guy, because 
[02:44:00]  I worked at the comedy store in L.A., was Yakov Smirnov.  Do you have anybody that'll help you move a couch?  The unfunny comic thing.  He helped me.  I mean, right...  I'm in Branson, Missouri now.  Right now, Bob, do you have anybody that you can go do?  Come over and help me just move this dresser.  I don't want them coming over.  Hey, Bob.  Hey, Bob.  I don't have anybody over.  Exactly.  I'll make my oldest daughter do it, throw her back out, and that'll cost me 10 grand. 
[02:44:30]  Bob, who...  This is Voss.  Who's the biggest actor you've ever done a scene with?  Um, the biggest actor.  Or actress.  A movie scene.  I guess for me, when I did Fars of the Penguin, Samuel Jackson was probably...  Yeah.  And Pryor, he did fucking critical condition.  Oh, what the hell was I saying?  Yeah, Richard Pryor.  Yeah.  He did a movie with Pryor.  So that backfired, Rich.  You dated me, Rich.  I'm a fucking idiot.  Bob, let me explain what's going on.  Rich did a little scene with Chaz Palmitari today, so he was trying to, like, brag to you,  and you just got squashed. 
[02:45:00]  I know.  And Bob, great is not the operative word.  It was Voss and Chaz, and it was fun to watch Chaz work, and it was fun to watch Rich.  Yeah, we set up Rich badly today.  He thought he was doing a scene with Jim Norton, and all of a sudden, Chaz walked in.  Did Chaz give you any respect?  He's such a nice guy, right?  He was awesome.  He was awesome.  He was great.  He quit the business.  After we read, he quit the business.  That's how bad I was.  He's actually rewriting a Bronx tale to be shouted, so it fits the way Rich did it.  All in one breath, too. 
[02:45:30]  You take one breath at the beginning.  That was hysterical.  Breathe.  What are you doing?  I don't want to see that thing.  Did you guys go see that?  Yeah, it was amazing.  He's actually just extended on...  It's funny you say that, because I did see it.  It was amazing.  He extended until February 24th at the Walter Kerr Theater here in New York.  It really is amazing, man.  Yep.  Right.  Now, Rich, are you going to get tickets to it, or do you have to pay for them?  You're not close with him now, right?  Oh, we're buddies.  Yeah, we're going to go out.  Oh, yeah.  You should go, boss, then come back and give a report.  I will.  Not during the weekend.  A review.  Not during the weekend.  I didn't get it.  I'm a comic. 
[02:46:00]  I understand our schedules.  I know.  Wait, New Year's Eve go.  Right.  Rich calls your baby.  Great.  Thank you.  She's getting big.  Really?  How big?  No, that's not nice.  Never mind.  She's beautiful.  Really?  Ridiculously, yeah.  Yeah, she's a right.  Yeah, she's beautiful.  Jesus Christ.  Norm's got to tell you.  She's beautiful.  But she's named after a what?  A Hispanic queen or something?  Hispanic queen, Reina.  Reina, yeah.  He thought he was picking out a Jewish name, and he picked out the name of a Hispanic queen.  I remember on the tour, you put a big picture of her up there on the screen of the Diamond 
[02:46:30]  Vision.  She looked very, very cute.  She's actually going to run the Latin Kings when she grows up.  Are you scared of having a daughter?  This is my third one.  Oh, so you don't really care.  His other two, yeah, are really hot, right?  What do you mean right?  You hit on them for an hour straight.  Oh, wow.  I forgot about that.  He goes, Anthony goes, right.  He tried to get her number.  Jesus Christ.  I didn't try.  I got it.  Jesus.  Voss' daughter.  But I was just to piss you off. 
[02:47:00]  I never meant any hill will.  I know when they were little girls, dude.  The last time the tour, his daughters came in.  I had to look.  Oh, here we go.  The other way on the wall.  I was like, holy shit.  Voss' daughter's turned into some beautiful girl.  This is the young one.  Yeah, your oldest daughter is very, I remember.  The thing is, like, Voss wouldn't mind if one of his friends, like, if I dated one of  his daughters, he'd probably at first be weird about it, but he knows that I know  them a long time ago.  Yeah, and he wouldn't do it because they don't have cocks, so why would Norman date them? 
[02:47:30]  You can't hit on your friend's kid unless she's so hot you can't help it.  Right, or unless she's too young to tell.  Or unless you're a shimmel.  But you don't want to get that shit on YouTube, either, because then you can ruin your life  with your next guy's daughter that you go with.  Yeah, that's true.  I don't know.  I got nothing.  Pop Saget.  Every time I turn on the TV, you're on it.  I mean, you're getting...  I know.  It's just ridiculous.  You'd think I'd rate somebody, wouldn't you?  It's really ridiculous.  But you're promoting one versus 100, right? 
[02:48:00]  Yeah, they tell me to do that.  Then why not?  You like that show.  You've been nice to it.  Absolutely, I like it.  I DVR it every week.  It's a great show.  Huh?  We had a live monkey.  Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.  And then he got one right, and then he got one wrong, and then shit himself.  Shit himself, and they had to get him out of there quick, because there was shit in one  of the problems.  And you guys changed it up just a little bit to make it more interesting, and...  Yeah, and the guy won a million bucks on the first one, which I thought was good.  I did not see that episode.  Yeah, they'll rerun it.  We only did eight of them, because it was the pre-writers' strike, and now that the 
[02:48:30]  thing's back and running, they can...  I just don't understand why they're throwing it on a Friday night, man.  They gotta move you up.  This is one versus 100?  Yeah, it's a great show.  I like...  I can't watch the Howie Mandel one.  It just doesn't do it for me, but that one versus 100, I love, man.  I like Deal or No Deal, too, but...  I don't get it, but...  I don't get it.  It's called Human Greed.  Spokesmodels on my show, like spokesmodels, and I actually killed it, because I just  figured I'd fuck them and ruin my career.  Well, you ought to get spokesmodels that are really fat, and then you reference them 
[02:49:00]  like some kind of an animal.  You make them stand by a watering hole, they never explain it.  They're fucking homo.  They come down with a briefcase, they open it, it's like the head from Seven.  One versus 100 chubbies.  You should just have them all come out.  They should do that.  It should just be overweight, non-attractive spokesmodels.  Absolutely.  I would watch that every week.  Could you imagine, like, Hagar comes out?  Right.  Girls that just look like Griselda and shit.  Hey, Bob, you gonna vote for Obama?  Well, I don't usually talk about my vote. 
[02:49:30]  I already did it in, but yeah, I think so.  That's the Hollywood thing to do, right?  Oh, yeah.  You got two Obamas, and you got one McCain.  Figure it out.  Right.  No Hillary's in the room?  No Hillary's.  Right.  Any Hillary's in the room?  Anybody voting for Hillary?  Anyone?  No.  You may.  Get out of here.  I haven't gotten over that.  Patrice Obama?  I've never gotten over the Amy Fisher video.  You don't give a shit?  Of course.  The what, Bob?  Of course. 
[02:50:00]  The Amy Fisher video that you made me watch.  I have not gotten over that yet.  Oh, her boyfriend, her husband's fucking Lou's red dick?  Yeah, Lou is great.  That guy with a dog leg caught to the left.  Anthony, would you vote for Obama if he was white?  No.  No.  McCain.  He's got a complete lack of experience.  I wouldn't vote for him if he was white.  If he's black, I might.  Yeah, he's an empty suit.  I wish we had an American Indian in there.  Cult of personality.  Gaming casino's the issue.  That's all he is.  He's a rock star.  That was a good line, Bob.  He's fucking Lenny Kravitz.  Put Lenny Kravitz in where fucking Obama is, and you get the same response. 
[02:50:30]  Boiled him down to fucking Lenny Kravitz.  He's a fucking rock star.  He's a cult of personality.  The guy's just a fucking, he goes and gives speeches.  People fucking start screaming, snapping pictures.  Girls are throwing themselves at him.  He's a fucking rock star.  Can we just have four?  None of them know what the fuck he stands for.  Let's have four years of that.  Okay.  Why not?  I'm not saying.  Is the country going to fall flat?  Did I say let's not do that?  I said, don't bullshit me as to his fucking motives. 
[02:51:00]  Easy, racist.  Easy.  And other people that are voting for his motives, they don't know what the fuck he's about.  They just love the guy because he's fucking LeVon Burton.  But do you know what anybody, this motherfucker, you call him the blind guy from Star Trek?  You're the air cleaner on his face.  What's McCain stand for, really?  McCain is a moderate fucking Republican.  That's right.  You just didn't say shit, though.  Like, what? 
[02:51:30]  Obama's a fucking Democrat.  He's not going to tax the shit out of me like Obama would.  Not trying to get this fucking socialist commie fucking health care.  Why don't you take some of your extra money and help the fucking country?  I'd love to take extra money.  I don't have extra.  I have enough for me.  The ex-wife took some.  Really?  Well, you know that.  But also, tax.  I get taxed up the ass already.  You have an elephant ivory tusk bathroom.  And I want more fucking taxes.  That's what I want.  Oh, Obama.  Look, I'm not taxed enough.  Could you take more out so you could do these fucking socialist commie programs? 
[02:52:00]  Go fuck yourself.  I fucking love Anthony.  You don't want goddamn health care for everybody, Anthony?  Oh, fuck no.  Why would I?  What privilege?  Just because you're an American, where does it say you have the privilege to fucking have health care?  To privilege to live.  This country is so great because some people make it to the top and some people get fucking shit on.  That's the way this fucking place works.  But do you think this is Stalinist?  You want to go to the Soviet Union?  No!  Is it Stalinist to help fucking...  Oh, what?  What?  What? 
[02:52:30]  What, Bob?  I got to go.  Shit.  See, Bob doesn't want to ruin his career.  You don't want to ruin your career.  You're a communist, Bob Saget.  Wait, let me tell you a story about this fucker.  Let me tell you about Bob Saget real quick.  Go ahead, Patricia.  We're out in front of fucking the laugh rag.  This is how phony Bob is.  He don't want nothing to work with.  Well, it means ditch stickers, too, you know.  We had an argument, right?  Just regular nobody comics.  Maybe I'll know one day if I'll make it famous.  But we going, hey, we arguing about the best burger.  Who has the best burger?  Everybody's like, fuck that nigga. 
[02:53:00]  Jack in the box.  Jack in the box.  Nigga, Wendy's, dude.  What the fuck you mean?  Bob goes, I think they're all delicious and juicy.  Just in case he could get a fucking deal with one of them.  Fucking asshole.  He wouldn't even decide what hamburger he likes.  That was a joke.  I love Bob.  I'm coming in soon.  All right, Bob.  Come on in soon.  All right, Bob.  I love you.  I'll see you soon.  One versus 100.  Friday night's, what, NBC?  I don't even know.  All right, he's gone.  Anthony's 100% right. 
[02:53:30]  Thank you.  100%.  Thank you.  There are people in this country.  No, no.  There are people in this country that think that because you're American, it entitles you  that everybody should be on the same level.  People bitch that they're impoverished.  Other people bitched that they're taxed too much.  That's the way this country works.  You forget where you came from.  Your angers are displaced.  I did not.  No.  I fucking know where I came from, and that's why I say I talk like this.  Your knuckles used to bleed.  Would you?  Back in the day.  So do yours when you walk.  Back in the day. 
[02:54:00]  Oh, wow.  Come on.  He had to fucking throw it in.  Come on.  Oh, Rich.  That was pretty good.  We're having a serious conversation.  Bob Kelly's like judging you.  That was pretty good.  It's like Simon Cowell sitting back there.  No without a doubt is the 75th gorilla reference in life.  I'm just saying because you have big arms.  But you shut up, stupid.  You can't lob up a knuckle softball.  I'm with you.  That was a great one.  I don't have lines.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Yes, yes, Patrice.  When you were fixing air conditioners, ductwork, would you have, back then, would you have 
[02:54:30]  liked to have a little relief somewhere?  You are a hardworking guy.  Yeah.  Who happened to be blessed to be able to be funny and get yourself out of that situation.  You wouldn't have wanted just a little bit of help somewhere.  Somewhere.  Just to help a fucking little bit.  Let me explain to you.  I dropped out of fucking high school.  Fair enough.  No, no diploma.  I didn't get a GED.  I didn't do shit.  Is this a bootstring story?  Yes, it is. 
[02:55:00]  No, no, no.  I'm not talking about now.  I'm talking about when I worked.  Then I got a job in air conditioning and heating.  And I fucking worked hard enough, just hard enough, to fucking get paid what I needed  and to get health care.  I had fucking health care.  Okay, fuck health care.  No, that's a big issue.  Is there a little something where, say if somebody said, you know, Anthony, we're going  to save you a couple of dollars on something that you need every month.  We're going to, you know what?  We're going to give you a little relief on your electric bill. 
[02:55:30]  Uh-huh.  And we're going to charge it to whoever the Anthony guy is that has money.  Oh, now?  Then.  Let me think.  Then.  Like, you know, we're going to give you a little relief for your bills.  Just a little on, just on the shoulders of a motherfucker that might have a little extra.  You'll never believe me.  I would say, fuck no, because it's not the ideology that this country's fucking based  on.  People think they're privileged.  They think they have an obligation.  It's not a privilege. 
[02:56:00]  No.  They believe the country is obligated.  The government and the people are obligated to fucking take care of everyone.  How can we feel that if that's never been the existence of this country?  I mean, there is welfare programs, but a lot of people are on welfare because they fucking  might need it.  I don't need welfare, but there's some people, dude, who aren't trying to buck the system,  but they just didn't.  You know, there's a.  Sorry.  This country is based on the ignorance of a lot of people. 
[02:56:30]  This country is based on like you happened to be able to have some talent to get the fuck  out of your situation, but there is a schlep that is going to be a schlep for his whole  life.  No shit.  But he could use a fucking hand to help out a little bit.  I wasn't fucking living out in the streets.  I had a roof over my head.  I ate.  I had fun.  I fucking had health care.  I worked my ass off, but I had a good time.  I wasn't fucking like I didn't like my job, but it supported me and I had what I needed. 
[02:57:00]  Motherfucker.  I've heard you say, but I've heard you say, man, I want it out.  Of course I did.  But you want it out.  Right now you're living.  Because I hated my job.  You're living you're out.  You hated your fucking job and then you weren't looking for a handout, but you were trying  to do better.  So if you're a Yabashiti.  What was your other option if you didn't?  I'd have been working right now.  I would have been in someone's fucking attic installing ductwork, but that's this fucking  country. 
[02:57:30]  Patrice, Patrice.  Let me hear from Jimmy a minute.  There's one thing here that I disagree with that only because the health care.  Health care is a big thing.  And again, I'm not talking about people who buck the system, but the fact that we're not  taking care of people who don't have enough money and I'm not talking about fucking social  leeches.  I'm talking about people who really do just work and make shit money and don't have coverage.  And yet the way we spend, like the way the Pentagon wastes money and that kind of shit, we are  being overtaxed.  They are fucking us in the mouth for our money, but they're putting it. 
[02:58:00]  And I'm not some fucking flaming liberal.  Oh, the war they're wasting.  But they waste even in times of not war.  They are fucking greedy.  They don't spend right.  They don't account for the money right.  So it's like, why can't that fucking wasteful shit be put into it legitimately?  So that it doesn't cost $11,000 for a fucking emergency room state.  The fucking government should look into insurance companies, things like that.  Restructuring of the premiums. 
[02:58:30]  Maybe Obama would do that, though.  Not take my fucking more tax.  You know, Obama would do that if it wasn't a tax and spend Democratic bullshit.  First of all, he wouldn't do that.  It's not.  This is the thing.  Presidents don't do shit.  He's promising.  Listen to his fucking speeches.  He's promising universal health care in this country before the end of his first fucking  term.  He's promising that.  It was in his fucking speeches.  Why is that hurting anybody?  If that leech could pull it.  If you know where the fuck your money's going, it's taking it anyway. 
[02:59:00]  I'd rather have my money go to a tail fin of a cruise fucking missile than go to some  motherfucking leech.  Are you serious?  No shit, motherfucker.  I'm not talking about leeches.  A fucking sick, dirty, sick leech.  This motherfucker got a goddamn basketball in his kidney, and he can't get relief?  He can't get relief.  First of all, the hospitals can't turn anybody down.  They can't turn anybody down.  You're saying, so where do you draw the line?  What the hell is $300 a fucking month for decent health care, man? 
[02:59:30]  What do you draw the line?  I pay five.  Try $760.  I pay five.  No shit.  $700 a month for motherfuckin' Dick Oxford.  Man, who the fuck has $760 a month to fucking pay health care?  That is completely ridiculous.  Who the fuck has that, dude?  So go to those fucking insurance companies and say, I want an accounting.  Where the fuck this money's going, you assholes?  I'll be honest with you.  If Obama got on and said that was his plan. 
[03:00:00]  See, he's got a plan.  I'm going to give fucking health care to everybody.  Well, fucking spell it out, asshole.  Tell me that you're going to go to these insurance companies and say, we're restructuring your whole fucking way.  Not that I'm being touched.  You're upset because you've got money, dude.  No shit.  What poor person is upset about health care fucking for everybody?  What poor person?  Because it ain't coming out of their fucking pocket.  It comes out of somebody's the has and the has not.  The trickle down theory. 
[03:00:30]  Trickle down motherfucker.  Trickle some of that shit down to somebody.  I trickle the fucking shit out of my money when I pay taxes.  They've got to take it anyway, Anthony.  So what if he applies it to health care?  I don't want more taken out.  To a rocket.  I don't want more taken out.  I agree with that.  I don't want to be 50% partners.  I'm spent.  I'm full.  I'm a partner with the United States government and I'm paying them much too much.  You think it's really only the insurance companies?  The pharmaceutical companies.  You get a prescription.  Bonnie had to get...  Right.  Look into that shit.  She had to get a prescription for a morning sickness with insurance. 
[03:01:00]  It was 12 pills.  They said, don't look at Rich.  Without insurance, it was 700.  But who do you think...  Who do you think is friendlier to those fucking...  I guarantee you that Obama, I think, will be less friendly to the pharmaceutical companies  and the insurance companies pulling that shit.  He's going to be more friendly to the impoverished and the people that can't afford shit, which...  Who are you voting for?  Who am I voting for?  Probably McCain.  Okay, what is he doing that makes you feel better than Obama with his health care? 
[03:01:30]  What is he doing that you're like, I can live with that?  Or is he doing something spectacular?  He's not doing...  It's more what he's not doing, which is democratic tax and spend.  I'd rather see tax cuts...  Like one thing Bush did that I think was good was tax cuts for corporations so they can then  hire more people and pump money into the economy.  Wait, was the tax cut contingent upon them hiring? 
[03:02:00]  Because what happens is if you say, look, you hire X amount of Americans, we'll give you  a tax cut.  That's one thing.  But if you give the tax cut and say, here, you can use it to hire more Americans...  Why would you do that when you got a Vietnamese child that's going to make your shit somewhere  for a dime?  They're not going to use it to hire more people.  They're pieces of shit!  Well then, how about take care of that fucking problem, too?  Again, Obama's probably more likely to do that.  That's how you become president in this shitty country, which is why nobody gives a fuck  anyway.  That's what I'm saying.  An old white man does the same shit he owes somebody. 
[03:02:30]  He owes a corporation somebody something.  So does an Obama.  Why not vote for him?  This is a thing that's fucked up.  Stop acting like motherfuckers are not voting for his policies.  Motherfuckers are not voting for a black guy.  That's it.  No, and motherfuckers are voting for a black guy.  I don't...  Do you think 85% of the black people that are voting for Obama are all voting because  they know his policies and love him?  They're voting for him because he's black.  Let me tell you something.  I do not believe in... 
[03:03:00]  I don't believe in the system.  I don't believe in electoral votes.  I think that's the biggest shitty scam I've ever heard in my life.  Oh yeah, we were talking about that earlier.  I don't believe in fucking...  I don't believe that he's necessarily winning these things.  That's why I'm not really like...  I'm just saying it'd be nice to see a black guy in the presidency because what do presidents  do?  Like I said, they only known for what event happened when they were president.  Can you give me the fucking policies of Abraham Lincoln, motherfucker? 
[03:03:30]  I'll give you one.  Can you use the fucking slavery and a bullet in the head?  Can you tell me what...  Tell me what fucking...  What about William Taft?  William Taft.  Exactly.  What the fuck did he do for this country?  Taft actually enacted the military defense fund.  That was Taft.  Jimmy, Jimmy...  I made that up.  Yeah, exactly.  Because Taft was in 1806 sometime.  What did...  Truman dropped the bomb.  Yeah.  JFK got shot and he fucked Marilyn Monroe.  What the fuck did Jimmy Carter do? 
[03:04:00]  We were discussing this earlier.  Jimmy Carter decimated the fucking United States military.  And he gave planes to the Iranians right before that silly Shaw dropped out.  Backing up our point from this morning, we said, what do you really know about these candidates?  Whether it's McCain, whether it was Carter, whether...  Did you know anything about Bush before you voted for Bush?  And one more point, Anthony.  This is the thing.  They all have...  Presidents have legacies.  Right.  At least Obama or Hillary.  At least whatever their legacy is going to be. 
[03:04:30]  It's already built in.  It's going to be the first...  It's built in.  So they don't need to figure out what's going to happen.  Let me tell you something.  If half the world blows up, it's still the first nigga president or the first bitch president.  You understand?  Yeah.  So what difference does it fucking make?  Now they might be able to do something because they don't have to figure out what their legacy  is going to be for four years.  Just vote for a black guy or a woman to see what the fuck's going to happen.  Then you can go back to old white guys with white legs.  That I can respect more than any other... 
[03:05:00]  Sick of old white guys in the White House.  That I can respect more than any other fucking thing I've heard is just, vote for the black  guy.  So let's all see what happens.  Let's see what the fuck happens.  I like the mystery aspect of that.  I like the movie aspect of it.  It's exciting.  It's kind of like, hey, we could all fucking be nuked or something.  Whatever.  We're not something different.  I respect more than, oh, it's not that he's black that the black people are voting or  it's the policies or this, that, or the other thing.  So you're looking at it as a grand adventure for the country for four years. 
[03:05:30]  There is a light around this guy.  There's some weird vibe people have.  Like when Jesse Jackson ran, when Sharpton is in the...  No one ever feels that way about these.  But there's some kind of a weird thing that I imagine JFK had, which is this weird thing  where you're like, wow, things are going to change somehow in a good way.  It's just a feeling.  Maybe that's a new way of doing things.  He's not going to...  He is still the other guy.  Even though he's winning, Hillary is so embedded into this government with all her connections. 
[03:06:00]  Dude, he's kicking her ass.  It doesn't matter.  She's embedded.  She's embedded.  Even though she's a woman, she's still seen...  They came out with a new one.  Even as a woman, she's still seen as more of the...  Even as a woman, she's still seen as more of the same shit because she's embedded.  So I think that's actually going to hurt her.  Because we've had a Bush or a Clinton in the White House.  That last name has been president for fucking since 1988.  Is it 1988?  I love Patrice.  Why are you so...  John, another old white guy. 
[03:06:30]  You know, would you be the same way...  Huckabee?  Hey, wait a second, Patrice.  Would you be the same way with Colin Powell if he was running?  You would go, let a black guy.  Or if it was Condoleezza Rice, would you be the same way if they were conservatives?  Absolutely.  If they were conservatives?  Yes.  Okay.  Because black people are not going to give a fuck about conservatives.  That's not true.  Black people don't stand behind black people.  If they were to vote for a black guy, conservative or not.  Are you serious?  Colin Powell versus Huckabee?  You don't think we'd vote for Colin Powell because he's black?  Condoleezza Rice, would they vote for her?  Absolutely.  You think so? 
[03:07:00]  Over any Democrat.  Absolutely.  Over any Democrat.  Yeah.  Of course they would.  They would jump party line for race.  That's what you're saying.  Black people aren't party line.  We don't believe in this shitty system.  Because Democrat is what we...  Look, that's just what we're raised to do, is be Democrats.  The shitty system that's put a black guy now pretty much right there at the footsteps of  the White House.  Yeah.  That shitty system.  Yes.  Yeah.  Okay.  But I don't believe in any of this...  See, you're educated on this shit, but the average layman... 
[03:07:30]  Look, man.  There is questionable...  There's questions about Bush winning Florida in 2000.  Right.  There's questions about it.  And we live under that.  We live under the possibility of a president that didn't really win.  And we don't give a fuck.  Same with Kennedy and Chicago.  Why don't we just fucking vote for a black guy?  Why do we give a fuck?  Why do we give...  We live under a guy, a fictitious war, which is we all agree this is some bullshit now. 
[03:08:00]  And he possibly didn't win Florida.  Possibly.  And we're comfortable watching this psychopath, Christian right-wing motherfucker, be our  leader.  We can't have a handsome, young, charismatic black guy for four years and just...  Clinton, his legacy is he got his dick sucked.  Right.  We can't vote for a fucking black dude.  So we want to put Sidney Poitier in there.  Well, he's got that mole still, though.  Yes.  And see what happens. 
[03:08:30]  Same with Kennedy.  Why not Sidney Poitier?  Sidney Poitier.  Why not?  I like Sidney Poitier.  God damn!  Jimmy's got to piss.  And we're getting away from Jimmy's first TV appearance, by the way.  I like the politics talk, actually.  Politics.  I like it.  It's a lot of passion in this.  A lot of passion in this discussion.  Okay, and the free healthcare, as you say, free education, too.  Where do you draw the line on free?  I'm just...  Where do you draw the line on free?  It's annoying if you want to give Americans healthcare and education.  Are you fucking arrogant? 
[03:09:00]  No, because...  Because it's a...  It's a show.  You wouldn't want your fucking daughters to be able to go to fucking university, $80,000  a year, whatever the fuck it is.  But if everybody just drops the playing field...  It absolutely does.  Holy shit, I'm saying Rich Voss is right.  Switzerland is a fucked up country.  You gotta admit that.  If you're a non-fucking-issue in the world, stop it, Switzerland.  We have a responsibility in this world that Switzerland will never fucking have to. 
[03:09:30]  To hold this whole planet...  To do what?  Bomb an ideology?  To keep this fucking planet...  Fighting terrorism is like fighting a word?  From ripping itself apart.  It's like fighting obesity.  The planet would rip itself apart if this fucking country wasn't here.  Really?  We've saved this country, this world...  Are you serious?  ...from the brink of fucking disaster.  We've only been...  We are the brink of disaster.  We drop a mushroom cloud on anything.  Oh, sure.  We fucked some shit up.  But what the fuck...  England ran the country for a second.  They ran the world. 
[03:10:00]  Oh, back in fucking wooden ship days.  So you're saying now, this is it.  We are the lead...  We've run this shit forever.  We were.  Europe is getting very fucking uppity rich and united these days.  But someone will pop up out of there and want to take over the world again.  Yeah.  I'm just saying, the United States, throughout the modern age, has saved this fucking planet  and shit countries like France and England and everyone...  Let's say from the 30s.  Let's say from the 30s.  Industrial age.  No, no, no, no.  Not even from the fucking 30s. 
[03:10:30]  Because Hitler was over there baking people till 42.  Yeah.  42.  Till 42.  Because we kept our...  So we weren't saving the world.  Because we kept our asses out of it for a while.  Exactly.  But after World War II, let's say then.  During and after.  The tail end and after.  And then the rest of the time, we're fighting Russians.  We weren't fucking saving the world.  Bullshit.  That is saving the world.  If we weren't here, the Russians would have fucking goose-stepped everywhere.  To where?  To every fucking country in Europe.  How do we stop...  We didn't stop the Russians from doing anything. 
[03:11:00]  Are you out of your fucking mind, Germany, North Korea?  We used to fight...  What do you think the Iron Curtain was?  We would fight the Russians.  See, what the Cold War was, we would just pay everybody...  Okay, if Russia went somewhere, we would pay some other little third...  This is why we have enemies now!  You don't think...  We would pay somebody to fight Russia, and then now the people we pay to fight Russia  hate our fucking guts.  Those were the small wars going on.  But you don't think that the Soviet Union would have just swept across fucking Europe 
[03:11:30]  and taken everything that Germany had with Russia?  The only concern we ever had with Russia was Bay of Pigs.  What other fucking fight did we have?  Right after World War II, Russia wanted everything that Nazi Germany had.  The only reason they didn't get it is because we said, fuck you, we're splitting this shit  up.  If our soldiers...  That's what he's right about.  If our soldiers weren't there, they really were a deterrent for the Soviets.  Holy shit, they wanted everything.  When the Soviet Union fell, all these places wanted their independence.  Germany really did want to take over a lot more Europe. 
[03:12:00]  We saved that entire fucking Europe, and now we get shit on by them.  They could go fuck themselves.  I agree.  And this country has been at the forefront of saving the goddamn world over and over  again.  Sure, we fuck up a lot, but, you know, what are you going to do?  We're wasting a lot of time, Anthony.  Ah, really?  The country.  The country itself.  Why are we still in Iraq?  I don't understand.  I said strategy.  I don't understand none of it.  I don't get that either.  I think because logistically, you can't just rip everybody out of there and all the equipment 
[03:12:30]  and say, take it easy.  And stop lying about democracy.  We've never liked democracy anywhere else but here.  We don't want democracy around the world because then we can't go and do what the fuck we want  to do.  That's why we want dictators and we play...  I agree.  This shit is shit that we did, man.  This shit, this fucking whole Iraq war is some other, it's some bullshit we was doing  in 19 fucking 70. 
[03:13:00]  That's what the fuck we doing.  I like this.  You can't vote for a black guy?  I agree with you on that one.  I agree with you on that one.  Vote for a fucking black guy.  Just vote.  Shut the fuck up and vote for a black guy.  I'm supposed to vote for the black guy.  Yes.  Just because he's black and let's see what happens?  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  I want to be alive for a black president.  Yes.  Just to see what happens.  It's good times for you and your business to just see what the Negro president's doing  now.  It would be the best thing for this radio show because he'll have a nervous breakdown.  Yes.  It would bring life somewhere. 
[03:13:30]  They could have an Anthony.  When is Anthony going to have a nervous breakdown contest?  Yeah, man.  When's the election in November 1st?  Vote for the fucking guy, man.  You think I should vote for him?  Just vote for fucking the black president.  It's as simple as that.  I don't think you can get past the black thing.  I don't know.  Can you get past the black thing?  He's light-skinned enough.  He doesn't really hate any.  He gets his chicken out.  I'm quite Sicilian.  He's not going to be running the country.  I mean, everybody around him is going to run the country.  Really?  Yeah, dude.  Do you see a trend in his supporters? 
[03:14:00]  A lot of white people support Obama.  Again, they can't tell me why.  But now he's the president.  Now, it's not an old white guy that all these white guilty people can then say, fuck  you, old guy.  We're not going to go along with what you say.  Now, it's a black guy in there.  And they'll go, oh, you know something.  Let's go along with him.  Why not?  Because we're so guilty as white people.  Let's see what the change he comes up in.  And more shit will pass under his presidency than any other president. 
[03:14:30]  Here's my fucking words.  But see, do you see that, see, Anthony, you have a fucking...  It might be good stuff.  Maybe good stuff.  Maybe good stuff.  That's a nice gamble.  You have political understanding, man.  You have some political...  I try.  ...savvy.  The average mother...  Remember Dukat...  Michael Dukat is...  He lost the presidency...  Tank helmet.  ...because he had a furlough program.  Nigga got out of jail.  Right.  Yep.  And it fucked him up.  Certainly did.  And that's how easy it is with this country.  This is an MTV country. 
[03:15:00]  I like him.  I don't like him.  Just vote for this motherfucker and see what he does.  He's the top American Idol guy right now.  That's what he is.  That's what Obama is.  That's this fucking country.  American Idol.  Anthony's the last piece of the puzzle.  You endorse Obama, it's a done deal.  If he wins, do black people have to stop complaining?  Anthony, look back.  He looked like a slave.  I just made bug eyes.  I was not voting for no black man.  Anthony's the last piece of this puzzle that's been happening.  If he wins, black people can't say anymore.  Fuck you.  See, that's the rule, too. 
[03:15:30]  Okay, go ahead, Patrice.  I'm asking.  If a Jew becomes a president, you can't talk about the Holocaust no more?  No, I didn't say the Holocaust no more.  No, shut the fuck up.  You're listening to me.  I said...  Racism is a part of our existence in this country.  So if it's a black president, we can't say shit about racism no more.  The Jews aren't using the Holocaust to hold them back in advancing their people  as they have in this country.  So we're using racism to hold us back?  Some black people, and I would say a majority, use slavery... 
[03:16:00]  Did you just make up more?  Yes, I'm making this up.  You just made up majority.  Through life experience.  You just said majority.  Yeah, we watched The Wire.  You don't think...  You don't think...  You don't think that black people use the fact that white people oppressed them  during slavery and afterwards as a...  And I don't want to use the word excuse, because there has been a horrific  racism in this country. 
[03:16:30]  Not really.  I understand that.  Not really.  There's been a horrific racism on this show.  But over the years, when we get to a point, and like Rich said, we get to the point where  a president, a black man is elected president, doesn't that negate, negate, every single  thing up to this point that now it shows that black people can achieve anything?  The ultimate in this country.  The pinnacle of power in the free world. 
[03:17:00]  That is not the fucking...  So why then should we take shit from Reverend Al about racist this and this?  Shouldn't Reverend Al become completely fucking irrelevant?  Shouldn't Jesse Jackson go the fuck away if there's a black president?  But see, you're making...  Is it irrelevant that all up to this point, every major leader up until this point has been  an old white guy, and all of a sudden, all the problems that we had when old white 
[03:17:30]  guys were president, that a black guy becomes president, that all those problems now disappear  just because of that?  Just because...  That's just like, okay, white people, at least you're not as bad as we fucking thought.  At least you voted for a black dude to do something for now.  Now let's do the next thing.  Do you really believe we're going to walk around and say, it's over?  It's done.  Not it's over.  We've seen Kumbaya, this nigga's the piece of the puzzle, but they're a piece of cure?  It plants a seed where excuses are no more, okay? 
[03:18:00]  Jews don't use the holocaust to hold themselves down like you said.  They use the holocaust to hold themselves down.  No, they use the holocaust.  Just part of it, not the holocaust.  You say something is no more to be poetic.  What do they say?  Reasons are no more.  They plant the seeds for the holocaust to say reason.  Now I don't know what he says.  Jews are elevated in this society.  Jews are seen as an overcoming situation. 
[03:18:30]  I said this a million fucking times.  You can move on.  It's a crime to be a Nazi to this day.  Niggas are just freed.  It's over, Negroes.  400 years of raping and mixing your color.  See that light-skinned girl right there?  I raped your mother, bitch.  We just are fucking done.  That's what I'm saying.  It's a vague existence we live in. 
[03:19:00]  We live with the enemy, and we're doing pretty fucking okay.  The fucking enemy.  I'm glad you said 400 fucking years ago.  The enemy.  We're talking about, and what I mean by the enemy, is your skin color, Anthony.  I don't look at you as an oppressor.  It's all of you.  Your skin color is my Hitler mustache.  And every white guy.  Is it really?  You know what?  Is it really?  How many fucking generations of my skin color?  Do you consider yourself a white guy?  Yeah.  You know, but your family probably came over here from the criminal thing, and- 
[03:19:30]  You're the Sicilian fucking thing.  You're from another country.  But I don't look that far back.  Why do you got to go 400 fucking years in your culture and still bring it up?  We understand.  Yes, it's been horrible.  You have to bring up the fucking Holocaust every second.  But like you said, they overcome this shit.  You can't yell this out.  Jews are more hated throughout this world than blacks are.  Okay?  Don't look at me with that thing.  Jews on the white supremacy list are number one. 
[03:20:00]  The only difference is we know you're black.  Some of us can get away with not looking as a Jew.  People, in this country, a black man will be a president before a Jew will.  That's right.  No question whatsoever.  Okay, so Jews, don't act like Jews have it so fucking easy.  I didn't say Jews have it easy.  There's 3% of us in this whole fucking country.  I know.  Look at the damage you've done.  No, no.  This is why nobody likes them.  I know.  This is why nobody likes them.  Because you just said that Jews have it so easy. 
[03:20:30]  You're uniting me with Patrice right now.  Jews are just-  Just shut up.  You know what?  Okay.  Just shut up.  We don't sit and complain.  At least black people are focused about food.  Everybody, let me tell you what this country is.  Everybody, it's white people on top and everybody positioning to be the most oppressed.  Right.  And that's what, and I will agree with you on that, is that I think that we qualify and  relate too much to how we are to white people. 
[03:21:00]  We don't really have an agenda.  We don't have a-  That's why a black president might just, because of that crime to each other.  Maybe if it's a black president, we actually might look at each other and go, hey, look,  let's not shoot each other in the face.  Because, you know, we got to make the, you know, let's make the black president proud.  Let's make, let's show them that we can just be proud.  Maybe, maybe all white guys, as our boss for our entire life, kind of get you a little  bit angry. 
[03:21:30]  I can, see, now that's a point I can appreciate and understand.  When Patrice says it like that, that I can understand.  Can we feel good for five fucking seconds, please?  I understand you want to feel good for five seconds.  Can we just feel good for five seconds?  I don't need, I don't need, you know, huge amounts of change.  You say, oh, oh, white guy, oh, white guy, oh, white guy.  It's done okay by me.  Of course.  And it's done okay by-  You have an old white guy existence, man.  You got some money, you're feeling good, you can go play golf, you drive a car, a nice 
[03:22:00]  car, a nice, every, you're living a nice existence.  And wait, guy, he didn't do all right by you.  I mean, you lived a life okay, but you were shit too.  Like, you fucking air conditioning guy, you happen to be brilliantly funny, so you made  a great career, but the fucking same system-  But that's everybody's life.  No, no, no.  It's called fucking work, Angel.  I know, but I'm saying, it's like, it's not like all of a sudden because you're white,  they fucking, you know, you were in the same shit.  Yeah, I know, I didn't get, but, and here's something.  And that's what I believe.  I believe that 100%.  This is why I don't like O'Reilly, and this is why, you know, Sharpton bugs me too, on 
[03:22:30]  a certain level, just because this country takes people who don't know, it's the no,  that take people who don't know and manipulate them into warring with each other and taking  sides, when poor black people and poor white people are in the same fucked up shit.  If I'm in the no, anybody in the no can elevate in this country.  That's the, that's the great thing about this country.  But if you're not in the no, man, if you don't understand shit, you're, you're destined 
[03:23:00]  and edging.  Well, get your fucking self in the no.  That's my thing is, people are-  It's not that simple.  That's not fair to say.  No, it is fucking simple.  Listen, man, this radio show took you to another level mentally, Anthony.  It exposed you to things that you wouldn't be exposed to.  I wouldn't, if I stayed in Boston, I would have never gone to Australia.  I talked to my friends in Boston.  I go, look, man, listen, fuck going to Miami.  Get your passport. 
[03:23:30]  You, we gonna go to Australia, eat sushi.  Nigga, I ain't no roll fish, motherfucker.  That would be me if I didn't, if comedy didn't place me places in this world to, to understand  more things, man.  But I, I educated myself before I ever got into radio.  I, like I said, I dropped out of fucking high school.  It wasn't like I needed a high school to teach me shit.  I fucking knew there was stuff I wanted to know about my life, the world, people, biology,  astronomy, and I pick up a fucking book, or simple enough, turn on a television show 
[03:24:00]  that wasn't some sitcom, and watch PBS or something, and maybe learn something, and educate  yourself.  People are too fucking lazy.  When are you gonna learn about black people?  They don't want to educate themselves.  I know enough about black people.  To not vote.  And I'm not voting for Barack Obama.  Obama, do you think, do you think black people are better off now than they were 20 years  ago?  Absolutely.  There are a lot of black people that don't.  And there are a lot of black people still using the same excuses of 20 years ago on the  racism and, and the oppression that was on top of them 20 years ago now. 
[03:24:30]  And the, the reality of the situation is that an educated, well-spoken black man has a  better chance at getting jobs and succeeding than a white guy does.  I was born a year after Martin Luther King got shot on the balcony.  A year.  Bullet misty, don't worry.  Yeah, I thought you were gonna say I was almost there.  My mother was, was living in the, my mother thinks differently than me.  I think a little differently than probably somebody that's 20 now. 
[03:25:00]  It's gonna take a minute to get past that, but, but the fucked up shit just stopped yesterday.  Like, that's what I'm saying.  And you act like we, this has been some thing where, that's like your boy that, what's that  fucking radio guy that you guys love?  You weren't in.  Bob Grant?  No, no, no.  Bob Grant rules.  Oh, Bobby.  That fucking old, we, let's just get back to the way it was.  For you, you fucking asshole.  The good old days.  The good old days.  Black people are just now thinking about the good old days. 
[03:25:30]  Do you honestly think just now and yesterday, fucking black guys ready to be president, and  you're telling me this was yesterday?  But black guys, first of all, time out.  Black guys, black people have run.  You had Shirley Chisholm, and you had Sharpton, and you had Jesse Jackson.  We've been, we've been, we've been running for a president.  But never serious contenders.  This is not new.  All Obama's doing is running for president.  Yeah.  So, that's not anything new.  We're talking about, there's an actual feel. 
[03:26:00]  This is what's fucking with Joe.  Yeah, yeah.  There's a chilly, white people are getting the chills.  And it's your own guilt.  We're not gonna fucking kill you.  It's called fear.  We're not gonna, we're not gonna fucking kill you.  We're not.  It's just a guy.  We promise.  Just vote for the guy.  Just stop fucking our women.  Will you vote for the guy?  Just vote for the guy.  Will you vote for him if he looked like Omar?  Omar.  The wire.  You vote for him if he acted like him.  Hey, Rich S. from Kansas City writes, Patrice just gave out the new winning Obama slogan. 
[03:26:30]  Just vote for this motherfucker.  I wanna see the signs.  Just vote for this motherfucker.  I'm gonna vote for him.  I'm gonna jump party lines.  What's interesting is that Sharpton hasn't endorsed Obama yet.  He shouldn't.  That's the best thing that ever happened for Obama because another thing about black leaders.  You think Sharpton's smart enough not to endorse him knowing it would hurt him out?  It's the, if, I don't believe, I believe that Sharpton would get up there because he's a guy who likes to be in the limelight. 
[03:27:00]  Well, he's been very quiet about this whole thing.  He would want to get up there and hold up Obama's hand and be, but if, God bless him, if he knows that that would be suicide to support Obama.  Because it would, it'd be a suicide.  You think Sharpton's smart enough to know that?  I pray, you know what?  I pray to God he's smart enough to not endorse Obama.  Who's Jackson endorsing?  I hope it's not, I hope it's not.  They're both endorsing Obama.  If they're gonna come out and endorse him, they have to.  Well, Bush was stupid enough to endorse him.  I hope they don't.  They will.  But everybody knows anyway.  That's not a big deal.  Bush was stupid enough to endorse McCain. 
[03:27:30]  You know, then Bush's popularity is, uh, sucks dick.  Dick.  So that's not gonna help McCain.  I'm sure McCain was like, oh, jeez, can you shut up?  Black people never had a leader in this country.  I mean, Martin Luther King was the, but see, he wasn't, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King,  they weren't, they were leader by proxy.  But the thing is, we've never actually voted for anybody that this country can't lead us.  Right, it was some kind of appointed, uh, like, like.  Al Sharpton is white people, that's, he's the white people's, uh, candidate for leading us. 
[03:28:00]  We've never, ever voted for Al Sharpton.  I certainly don't remember casting a vote for him.  Exactly, and the leader of black people is always who white people hate.  So, Lord knows, I does not want Obama to get supported.  Black people should not support him.  We should go, fuck that motherfucker.  And then vote for him in the cut.  Because if the more white people see that black, he's not accepted by black people,  this might be, we just might be, let's take, let's just, let's look into this. 
[03:28:30]  Because if black people start doing coming to America shit, and every town is a bongo fucking parade,  boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Welcome, Obama, Barack, go, go, go, baby!  Yeah, and Barack comes out trying to be black.  What's up, motherfuckers?  Can you dig it?  Can you dig it?  Hey, Brad from New Jersey.  Brad from New Jersey, Scott. 
[03:29:00]  Cyrus.  Let me get this in, let me get this in.  Brad from New Jersey writes, in the words of the great Ron Bennington,  white people have been running things for the past 50,000 years or so.  Maybe we need a break.  Maybe we need a break.  Four more years.  Four years.  Oh, we want to lay back and go, you know something, you take the wheel for a while.  Right.  Let's see how this goes.  Don't you want to rest and look at all the sights?  Right, right.  And you saw how good.  All the shit y'all blew up.  Don't you want to look at all the shit you blew up over the flat?  That would be nice.  You saw how good Idi Amin did. 
[03:29:30]  That's true, Charles Taylor.  See, that's the fucking, you motherfuckers.  That's the vision.  That's where Forrest Whitaker won the Oscars.  White baby sandwiches is what we're going to eat from now on.  Key grip in his eye.  Lift the eye.  That's what it is.  White baby sandwiches.  The Negro dictator.  Uh-huh.  Are you fucking, you know. 
[03:30:00]  It's a joke.  I'm voting for Obama now.  No, but that's why.  Bobby Joe, we had a joke about Floyd Mayweather.  Mm-hmm.  Bobby, you know, you joke.  That's the thing.  You know, your friends, you joke racially.  But it helps.  Yeah.  So Floyd Mayweather, though, he's just a, you know, he's an arrogant dude.  He's a charismatic, arrogant motherfucker.  So white people, I'm just like, Bobby, why don't you vote for him?  Why you vote, I mean, not vote, but why are you not for him?  He goes, I just want, I just want black people to be polite. 
[03:30:30]  I just want a little.  And we were joking, but this fucker, he was serious.  Anthony, let me say something.  Thank you.  I just want him to say hello.  Oh, Bobby's still here.  Yeah.  And goodbye.  Have you ever tried to get, that's it, right?  Hi, how are you?  I'm good.  How are you?  That's right.  Even if they're faking it.  Wait, how's this going to go?  Even if they're faking it, bastard.  Hold on, hold on.  Bobby's Obama?  Jimmy's leaning toward Obama?  I think I'm leaning towards Obama.  I like the Obama.  Voss is McCain.  No, I'm leaning towards, I'm kind of leaning towards Obama so I can just. 
[03:31:00]  Holy shit.  Well, not because it, I really don't want him.  Before all this, because McCain is a little old, he's a little liberal.  So what the hell?  Let's see the liberals.  Liberal.  Let's see what happens.  The bottom line is there's a weird feeling around it, dude.  That's what it's about.  Because I usually typically despise Democrats.  I don't like the tax policy.  I agree 100%.  Do not make me a 50% partner with the government.  You're right.  Jimmy's had an interesting couple of years on this radio show because you were so much  more Republican two years ago than you are now.  Bush has destroyed the Republican Party's unity. 
[03:31:30]  Bush destroyed it.  Because of the religious aspect of them.  Yeah.  Because of this fucking $350,000 fine, which is all parents, television, council shit.  Like the Democrats are repulsive with their fucking political correctness, but the Republicans  are also...  Yeah, let's not forget it.  I know.  And if you had a qualified white guy...  Obama wanted Imus gone, but we didn't forget that.  Yeah, that's true.  But that's the political way to do it, though.  They're all going to agree with the Imus fire.  But you've got to admit, if you had what you thought was a qualified white Democrat guy, 
[03:32:00]  you didn't give a fuck who it is.  He'd win the presidency.  It's weird that Bush has taken us to the place where, get these Republicans out of here,  and now you're sitting there waiting around for the old white guy Democrat, and it's  like, oh my God, a bitch and a nigga?  Nothing else?  And Mr. Romney, a fucking Mormon from Utah, and John Edwards blew this.  How did that fucking limp?  No kidding, man.  Jesus Christ, it was a fucking Benetton ad, you coxer. 
[03:32:30]  You couldn't fucking win the nomination, a black guy and a fucking Mormon?  And you'd bowed out first?  You wouldn't vote for, if it was just a qualified Democratic white guy, he'd win.  This was the easiest election for the Democrats to win.  And they're making it close.  Hold on.  If it's a woman and a black guy, it might be the president in the Oval Office, they're  really going to have to check the jokes.  The running gags around the White House are definitely going to have to change.  You know what, dude?  The president's going to get nothing done. 
[03:33:00]  Dude, he's a figurehead.  But it's been interesting watching Jimmy, because it's been a transformation going on  with you the last few years.  But again, my problem is the conservatives forcing their morality about fucking gays  and all that shit down my throat makes me sick.  Jimmy's done that, and I've joined the NRA, and I'm stockpiling weapons.  But that's who's fucking up radio.  Nobody in this business should be voting for a Republican, dude. 
[03:33:30]  This fucking Huckabee, President Huckabee?  But he's so out.  Mathematically, he doesn't even have a chance.  He's done scapegoat.  McCain, a guy that was abused in Vietnam?  That fucking has bad dreams.  Yeah, but see, the reason I like Obak, too, it opens the door for Jews.  Obak?  Who's Obak?  Whatever.  It opens the door.  No, Obak.  It's not.  Whatever.  You've got to pull it off.  I said Barack.  I said Barack.  Which one's the elephant and which one's the donkey?  Barama?  I said Barack.  Which one's the elephant and which one's the donkey?  It opens the door for Jews.  I'm voting for Redenbacher because of his popcorn man. 
[03:34:00]  You just heard him, right?  You just heard what he said, right?  What was that?  It opens the door for Jews.  That's what he's concerned about.  Oh, that's all he cares about.  You're damn straight.  Get in line behind everybody.  Absolutely.  Because this country is very racist when it comes to Jews.  We'll have a fucking tranny first.  Because we already feel.  See, this is the thing about the racism about Jews.  I'll say it.  You already feel that you're running the country.  But it's ridiculous.  Behind the scenes, clandestinely, they feel that you're.  No, who won it?  The Wasp run this country.  That's who runs it.  The Wasp.  The Wasp.  The Wasp. 
[03:34:30]  The Wasp.  The Wasp.  Not anymore.  The Wasp.  The Wasp.  The Wasp.  The Wasp.  The Wasp.  The Wasp.  The Wasp.  The Wasp.  The Wasp.  It's a giant Wasp.  The Wasp.  The Wasp.  That runs at any place to sting you.  Because corporations run it.  Corporations run it.  Yeah, the country.  And banks and.  The Wasp belongs to most property.  Why the fuck do Jews always get mad when people say they run the.  What kind of racism.  It bothers you to say you run the banks.  No, we do not.  We don't.  Shut the fuck up.  What, what, because I'm not joking.  Black people are rapists, robbers, and junkies. 
[03:35:00]  You run the banks?  What are you guys doing, Kevin?  Are you fucking complaining?  Shut the fuck up, Jews.  Don't forget big dick.  Shut up.  You guys get big dick.  At least now we're educating people out.  We're animals.  Big dick robbers.  These motherfuckers.  Big dick robbers.  Diamond district, diamond district fucking bankers.  In Hollywood.  In Hollywood.  Right.  And you motherfuckers, what, what else do you want?  Shut the fuck up.  Shut the fuck up.  We're not taking the blame for this country.  You may, you may.  We're taking, and when you say.  Oh, shut the fuck up, man.  Shut up, when you say Jews run the country, then we take the blame for what's going on in 
[03:35:30]  this country.  You make, here's what Jews, I admire Jews.  Answer that.  Answer that.  They made the Godfather cry about saying a statement that I didn't even see nothing wrong with,  and they made him cry and give all his money to Simon Wiesenthal.  I don't know what you do.  I don't know how you do it.  You made Mel Gibson cry.  I don't, I respect your power.  You have some sort of power.  Do you need the presidency for your fucking self-esteem?  Vice president.  Vice president.  Black people could fucking just vote for a black guy for our self-esteem. 
[03:36:00]  Like I said, I've had to look at Jeff Spicoli pictures as Jesus for my entire fucking life.  Can I just be proud for a minute?  I think it's more Lance from Pulp Fiction.  Lance.  Can you give me a fucking break?  Can you give us five seconds?  You run shit.  It is amazing we're still going with the right Jesus.  It's still amazing.  It won't change it.  How are we going to change it now?  There's black people that are fucking horrified to see a black Jesus. 
[03:36:30]  Just take a history lesson.  That guy wasn't white.  He certainly was.  He had blonde hair and blue eyes.  He was inspired by God himself.  He was white clean by the hand of the Lord.  Oh, just because he was born on a certain place in the earth.  His father's supposed to be God.  How the hell do you know what color he's going to be?  God fucking shot a big white man load.  He had dirty blonde pubes.  Are you saying that in the Bible there's a part missing where he came from Iowa all the way to Baghdad?  What is now Iowa?  No, no. 
[03:37:00]  It doesn't matter where he's from.  What is now Iowa?  Since God.  What is now Iowa?  Who is an old white guy with a big white beard.  Since he's the father.  You know, he came out white.  The three wise Irish guys.  I'm sure.  He came out white.  I'm positively sure.  That's right.  In Baghdad.  I'm sure there was a white Jesus with a perm.  So he was an Arab.  Don't try to claim him as a black guy.  I didn't.  That's what I'm saying.  I at least say he looks more like Saddam Hussein than he does.  Mocha.  He was mocha.  Whatever makes you feel better.  He highlights Saddam's hair and straightens his feet.  He looked like Sam.  He looked like our own Sam. 
[03:37:30]  Sam.  Curly hair.  He had feet of bronze.  And we don't complain too much about that.  Maybe they were just dirty feet of bronze that could flick quarters off of them when he was young.  Maybe they were just dirty feet of bronze that could flick quarters off of them when he was young.  Maybe the feet of bronze were dirty.  That's what he meant by that.  Christ didn't wash his feet.  He was busy.  We don't complain a lot about white Jesus.  It's not often you hear just the black Israelites complain about black Jesus.  Yeah, yeah, they complain about that.  But the average black person is so used to looking at white Jesus and so afraid of God.  Black people are so afraid of God that we're not going to fuck around with God's image that we've seen all this time.  But at least, you know, you leave Jesus alone. 
[03:38:00]  And we have left alone the fact that, especially over the past 20, 30 years or so, black people have tried to lay claim to every single invention made.  Yeah, we've really got to stop this shit.  I'm getting a little tired of hearing during Black History Month how this motherfucker invented the stoplight.  That's right.  Is that not...  I don't know.  Now what are you going to do?  Just pass right through it and fuck this nigga technology.  And kill somebody?  We've helped you white people live.  That's how we invented it. 
[03:38:30]  Lord and Jesus, how do we keep white people alive?  Growing up in school, all I knew was Peanut Man.  I didn't have to deal with anything else to remember anyone but Peanut Guy.  And now it's stoplights.  How about Charles Drew?  The filament for the light.  He was helping Edison behind the scenes.  How about Charles Drew to fucking help him cure his fucking AIDS every time he fucks a transverse?  There you go, one of that.  The heart transplant guy.  Thank you.  I understand.  But Jesus.  There's always a black guy who invented it that he stole.  I drink like six cups of coffee backstage.  I feel like I'm talking like a McDonald's hamburger tonight.  We could all unite in our hatred of Jimmy's act. 
[03:39:00]  It's time to unite.  Hold hands.  Black Jim.  Racist.  Racism goes out the window when Jimmy's doing his act.  Let's all get on board.  You need your phone.  What?  Quick break.  Don't do a double on me.  A quick break.  Okay, we'll do some Jimmy audio and get the fuck out of here.  But it's got to be a quick break.  It has to be.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Dude, let's go!  Just hilarious. 
[03:39:30]  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Really funny.  If I could use the word, I would.  Not that word.  Really awful, too, by the way.  I'll acknowledge that.  But I lost my thought.  I'm sorry.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  All right.  We're uniting.  That was a great hour of radio. 
[03:40:00]  Oh, look at this faggot.  Oh!  I'm sorry, Opie, man.  Look at him.  Brian McNamee.  Fucking worm.  Needs a fastball to his fucking nerd glasses.  Worm.  Worm.  They are fucking worm.  Go fuck yourself, Brian McNamee.  God damn.  Let's look at his fucking dumb foot.  God, he's a worm.  Fucking saving needles and shit.  Go fuck yourself.  Shit.  And I'm not even a Clemens fan, to be completely honest.  Right.  It's just some code.  It's a man code.  Like, you pussy.  Right.  Exactly. 
[03:40:30]  He's a Jew.  Blame it on a Jew.  This is the guy that ran and told the teacher in high school.  While you're trying to get a cigarette in outside or something.  Well, smoking's bad for you.  Well, let me tell you this, though.  Roger Clemens, big head.  Big steroid head.  Thank you, dude.  Oh, my God.  It's just giant.  Oh, it's a brontosaurus head.  Fuck God.  It's giant.  He shaved his head, which was really bad, because you could see where it's, like, protruding  in places.  Maybe it shouldn't be protruding.  It should be on a fucking mountain in Rushmore.  He's growing one of those stegosaurus pumps. 
[03:41:00]  I don't know what's going on.  He's in the middle of altered states.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Having fun, but now we've got to stop.  What happened, Jimmy?  What happened?  Yes.  Is there any way to rewind the tape?  For about 30 seconds.  Yes.  What happened?  I don't even want to say what it is.  I heard it.  I don't even want to say what it is.  All right.  We were having fun, and what did Rich say?  I had a good line.  You did?  Hold on.  Don't I?  Just wait.  All right.  It's about the size of his head.  We got it?  They're trying to find it.  Just give me a heads up when you got it.  Oh, you got it, Derek? 
[03:41:30]  He'll get it.  Derek's good.  Yeah, this was a good move.  I had to do it.  Oh, Derek.  That's way too inside.  I made a joke for three people just now.  Oh, he's got it?  Okay, let's hear it.  Come on, Derek.  Let's hear this gem.  Yeah.  It's a good one.  Teacher in high school.  Oh, you're trying to get a cigarette in outside or something.  Well, smoking's bad for you.  Well, let me tell you this, though.  Roger Clemens, big head.  Big steroid head.  Thank you, dude.  Oh, my God.  It's just giant. 
[03:42:00]  Oh, it's a brontosaurus head.  Fuck.  God damn it.  He shaved his head, which was really bad, because you could see where it's, like, protruding  in places maybe it shouldn't be protruding.  He should be on a fucking mountain in Rushmore.  Okay.  There it was, people.  He should be on a mountain in Rushmore.  With Baruch's face on it.  He should be on a mountain in Rushmore.  Because there's a town called Rushmore.  Rushmore.  With a mountain in it. 
[03:42:30]  Oh, my dear, sweet Jesus.  Could you just try, Voss?  Could you try?  Yeah, please.  Geez.  Wow.  Where the fuck, when I was in Seattle, there was a sign that said, Everett, the next town.  And I wasn't paying.  I woke up in the morning.  I go to the guy.  That's not the mountain, is it?  Right?  You're frighteningly stupid.  Oh, my God.  Frighteningly.  And that's what bothers me.  Mount Everett.  About, Voss is, he's a fucking, a distinguished age. 
[03:43:00]  And I, sometimes I feel fucking bad calling Voss dumb.  He's 53 years old.  I'm 53.  I'm not smoking.  And I swear to God, man, sometimes I go, why do I, I treat a fucking man, his age, with  this, like, I feel so comfortable calling him fucking dumb.  He's 20 years older than all of us.  And it bothers me that I'm always like, you're fucking dumb, Voss.  But I'm like, God damn it.  He just reinforces it on a daily basis. 
[03:43:30]  Yes, like, I want to look at him like this guy.  On a minutely basis.  I want to call Voss for advice.  I can give you advice on life stuff.  That's what I'm saying.  I can give you advice on life stuff.  You can give me advice?  No, I say advice on life stuff.  Like what?  What?  You know.  Shit like relationships and fatherhood.  Hey, Voss, how'd you get so stupid?  Was it the crash?  How'd you get so stupid?  Oh, my God.  Because there's intelligence in there.  Where?  It just comes out weird.  It's wisdom, but not... 
[03:44:00]  Voss is fucking dumb.  We're talking about you, if you don't know.  But he has wisdom.  Voss has life, man.  I respect.  I love Voss, but he's so dumb.  He just hasn't died.  Voss needs to slow down.  Oh, really?  Just slow down a little bit.  So what should I do?  Put on 300 pounds?  See?  There you go.  See?  He smashes one.  You know what?  But Bobby's working on it.  I'm going to the gym now.  To get to four? 
[03:44:30]  You know what it is, too?  Can I say?  I went to the hospital, the doctor yesterday to get checked out for everything.  I want to get a clean bill of health for everything.  And she actually...  I didn't even go in.  I went in there for...  Referred you to a vet?  Listen.  I went in there for herpes, syphilis, all that shit.  She goes, all right, first thing you're going to do, lose weight.  I go, I'm not...  I'm working out.  I'm trying.  And then she hands me a piece of paper, the fat chart.  Have you seen this?  No.  It tells you you take your age... 
[03:45:00]  What you're supposed to be.  ...and your height.  Yeah.  ...and what you're supposed to be.  It's ridiculous, though.  That chart, by the way.  It says obesity.  5'1".  Obesity.  800 pounds.  Obesity.  You're supposed to be Jupiter.  Before obesity...  Listen to this, though.  The chart is way...  It's fucked up.  Go ahead.  It says...  I know what you're going to say.  I'm an extreme...  I'm an extreme obesity.  Extreme obesity.  It says extreme...  And how tall are you?  I'm 5'8".  You're the headliner of obesity.  5'8".  And how much do you weigh? 
[03:45:30]  I weigh 260.  That's not that bad.  260?  If that was muscle?  5'8", 260?  That's crazy, Dave.  Well, maybe he's off by 80 pounds.  But that's the thing, though, is that, like, I have a lot of muscle on me.  Shut up.  Well, I tried.  All right, can we...  Why don't you do that VH1 show?  Blame it on muscle?  What VH1 show?  Why don't you do the one, the VH1 show where they lose weight?  You know what I want to ask you to do.  It's the celebrity part.  Can we do, uh...  Can we...  It doesn't say on TV one's Fit Club.  Has 30 good minutes Fit Club. 
[03:46:00]  That's right.  Welcome to this edition of does college is fucking us.  The who Fit Club?  By the way, according to the same chart, I'm borderline overweight.  You?  Really?  Yeah, that's how stupid this is.  Yeah, that chart is really...  Really?  I'm still in the healthy weight category, but barely.  Wait, what about two?  I'm 5'7".  I'm 5'11", and I'm about 170.  Colin Quinn is actually above top.  So I just make it to the healthy weight category. 
[03:46:30]  One more pound, and I'm officially overweight.  I'm 5'6", and a half, about 155.  Yeah, where's that chart?  Because Colin Quinn is actually fatter than me up top, looks fatter than me, but he actually  weighs less than me.  He weighs 230.  He's got skinny legs.  He's got skinny legs.  Yeah, he's got ostrich legs.  What are you, Jimmy?  About, say, 5'6", and a half, 5'7".  5'6".  No, I'm not 5'6", I'm a little taller.  No, I'm 5'6", people!  You're at 153, you just lost two pounds in one minute. 
[03:47:00]  Wait, how much you weighed, Jimmy?  My dad was taller than me.  I was tall, but I was tall.  155?  Yeah, 155.  You are, you're like, you're like me.  You're just about overweight.  Just about.  You just make it.  Let me see this.  How are you doing?  How tall?  Oh, yeah, let's get to the tape.  Fuck this.  All right, Jimmy's first TV appearance 11 years ago.  Can you tell, I am so hyper right now.  I drank like six cups of coffee backstage.  I feel like I'm talking like a McDonald's hamburger tonight.  You know, no wonder women don't like me.  It is not sexy to be this hyper on a date. 
[03:47:30]  You know, hi, how are you?  Get away from me.  You look like Cousin Ed at the chemotherapy.  You know, God.  I would love to make love to a woman who is just as hyper as I am.  That would be worth filming.  You know, I can't sleep.  Oh, my God.  Oh, he's killing with that horseshoe.  That's your third comparison bit throughout the set.  Oh, my God.  He really is, man. 
[03:48:00]  It's just a theme of Cousin Ed.  He's chewing his finger and everything.  Are you performing on the Yellow Brick Road right now?  Is that why you're doing so well?  That became your punchline for every joke.  The Hambler Burglar.  Cousin Ed.  That was it.  Norton, we used to get him on that formula.  It was take something and add a terrible disease to it.  My feet look like a thing with AIDS.  What?  You have to slip in it, and then you have to die, and then you have to go. 
[03:48:30]  I wish I'd slip in a puddle of that set.  That's what you said.  Why, Rich?  Why?  You didn't even let it go back to it.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Swing and a miss.  You know, you should be on a mountain, stupid.  We weren't even sure.  Hold on.  Hold on.  But the observation, we weren't even sure if it was a swing or a miss yet.  You didn't even give it a chance to sit there for a second.  This show was a destruction of all his confidence.  That was right.  What did you say?  I didn't hear what you said.  I just shit on you.  What did you say?  I didn't hear it.  I was fucking shitting on you for no reason.  I'll be very honest.  What did you say?  Your eyes gave away, Jimmy. 
[03:49:00]  Why did you know?  Why did you just sound like your sex just now?  Did you just...  I didn't even say it.  He's not giving it away.  I don't know people.  I don't know.  I don't hear what people say.  Eh.  Eh.  Oh, you really do sound like a fairy.  All right.  Let's get back to the tape.  Come on.  Oh, please.  Please.  We're trying to, like...  Jimmy's so uncomfortable.  He's chewing on his finger.  He's like...  He's really uncomfortable with it.  We've got to kind of go in a speed round.  He's really making me cringe.  The only reason is because they're going to cut us off because we haven't taken many  breaks.  I think we've got another 10 or 15 in us, but after that, it's pushing it. 
[03:49:30]  I am so lonely.  Any hookers here?  I don't get hookers.  I don't understand, in this day and age, why is prostitution illegal?  What is prostitution?  It's paying somebody for sex.  That's against the law.  Is it really, Carl?  No, pornography is totally legal, and what is that?  It's paying somebody for sex and then showing it to the world.  What the hell is the difference?  So if you're going to get hookers, take my advice.  Bring a video camera. 
[03:50:00]  This way, if the police kick in your door and yell, what the hell's going on in there?  You can just jump back and yell, cut!  See?  I like the little...  See?  Do you understand this?  Can I ask that question?  When you said, are there any hookers here, and nobody responded, did you go...  Did you snap your fingers and go, darn?  Like, did you make a little hand movement?  It wouldn't surprise me if I did.  Gosh darn it.  I wish they were listening.  Thank God we can't...  We can't clear that up. 
[03:50:30]  Jimmy's high voice makes mine sound very bassy from the 80s.  Yeah!  Oh, my God.  It is just hard.  I thought I had a high voice back in the day.  Jimmy sounds like he's two inches tall.  That's funny, Voss.  I sound like your fingers...  There's something that he sounds like, but I can't get the exact...  It's just...  Urkel.  It's motherfucking Urkel.  Yeah, it's...  Yes, it's just... 
[03:51:00]  Yeah, well...  It's somebody who's trying too hard.  He really is.  I swear to you, there's somebody who's trying too hard.  He wanted to represent the rest of these Jersey Hacks.  He wanted to show Bob Levy, I can do it.  And you actually told your jokes like you were reading off a cue card.  Are there any...  Because I don't know why it's...  If you can down point, you should be able to fuck point.  Shut up.  And that voice should never make points.  Breaking news. 
[03:51:30]  You should only go knock, knock.  That's a knock, knock who's their voice.  Breaking news.  Andy Pettit misheard our conversations about HGH.  That's what Clemens...  Oh.  Clemens, man.  He didn't hear him right.  That's okay.  Oh, boy.  Could happen.  Oh, God bless him for taking this all over the edge.  He's not going to flinch this, Clemens.  Now he misremembers.  Huh?  Misremembers.  Andy Pettit misremembers our conversation about HGH.  Misremembers.  Yeah, he just wasn't in his ass or his thigh.  That's why he doesn't remember. 
[03:52:00]  Yeah, not sure.  Who even forgets that shit?  You don't forget, you misremember.  Clemens also said so far,  I was shocked I had no idea that Pettit had used HGH.  All right, cut.  All right, here we go.  More Norton.  We're getting to the interview portion.  Oh, good.  That's really...  I try to sound like Sean.  I want to talk about something that's important.  I was almost killed today.  This is true.  I was cut off.  Thank you for laughing at that.  I was almost killed by ribs.  I was cut off by a tractor trailer.  I have an airbag.  Stop it.  What was that?  What did you just say? 
[03:52:30]  I think I improv'd.  No, you didn't because you'd be a hole in the back of your head.  You killed him.  Why can't you just...  It was all on Jimmy.  It was all piled on Jimmy.  Yeah, you can't be part of these anymore.  And you bring it right back to yourself.  You can't be part of these anymore.  That's right.  Don't fuck yourself.  I got a million great lines.  Then we end up beating you up instead of beating up the guy that we want to beat up.  All right.  Go to him.  All in the back of my head.  I try to throw something out.  Fuck you.  I slammed you guys last time I was in here.  Barely.  So I... 
[03:53:00]  Oh, barely my fucking ass.  Play the one where he talks about taking a shower with his brother.  Exactly.  Don't get a hole in the head.  Don't get on me.  All right.  I'm just trying.  Just sitting here.  I live amongst you people.  You throw out a bunch of two-stick good.  You fake seven handicap.  Oh.  Go ahead, Keith.  I just want to hear...  Well, the boss cheats, and then he says he shoots under 80.  It just needs to be set.  I don't fucking cheat.  Are you crazy?  I've played enough golf with you.  I never cheat.  What, Bob?  You don't tan either.  It's just the sun out all the time around you. 
[03:53:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Another Mercury vacation.  Fuck yourself.  What were you saying?  I just...  When you fake laugh, that little...  Was that...  Oh, you heard that too...  Yeah, that's nerves, right?  Yeah, it's nerves.  It's got to be nerves.  No, no, it wasn't nerves.  It can't be nerves.  No, no.  It was...  Let me tell you what it is.  Norton is known.  Now, to be little mean guy, little mean crazy guy, before, he wasn't sure that people  weren't going to accept any of his little so-called horse shit edgy material, so he had  to give him a little laugh to say, I was trying to be funny to the guys. 
[03:54:00]  It's the same as the guy that does this.  It was the same thing.  It's the fear of silence after a punchline.  It was the same as the guy goes, did you hear that?  Like, I went down there, and it was Tuesday.  You guys know what I'm talking about?  Listen, are you explaining that to the audience?  Who are you explaining that to?  To the people listening, because they don't know the comedians.  But also explain that you stink.  No, but I mean...  But it's a good point, though.  I mean nothing, Haley and Boyce.  Jimmy's making a really good point.  Yeah, it was a fear of silence.  Jimmy brought a great thing to our radio show, because when we bombed doing our shit on 
[03:54:30]  the air, we wanted to cover that up with...  Oh, it was so uncomfortable.  We wanted to cover it up with fake laughter, or just move on immediately, and Jimmy taught  us how to just slow the fuck down and enjoy the bomb, enjoy the uncomfortableness.  Yeah, I was scared of the material defending people, yeah.  But that's why it's interesting.  Back then, you were nervous.  He wanted to fill up the dead space.  He wasn't comfortable.  Right, so that little...  So why would you be...  How did you go?  I don't remember.  Just try.  No.  Just try to do it.  Why don't we just play it on tape? 
[03:55:00]  Why would you be so nervous?  Because I almost killed my ribs.  I was cut off by a saccadrall.  Oh, my ribs!  I was doing the audience, because they laughed, but I was almost killed.  So I was trying to be really funny and off the cuff.  Is that where Frunkus came from right there?  No.  That sounds very Frunkus-y there.  Frunkus is only a year or two.  Ribs.  I was trying to do the character when I was two years old.  I was good.  All right, let's try to get to this.  You little bastards.  Cut off!  Thank you for laughing at that.  Because I almost killed my ribs.  I was cut off by a tractor trailer. 
[03:55:30]  Now, I have an airbag in my car.  A driver's side airbag.  A few of you nodding.  You have an airbag?  It is such a hazard to have one.  Because when you have an airbag, your horn is not where it's supposed to be, is it?  Fuck you.  Right?  It's not in the middle of the steering wheel where it's been for 80 years.  And that's where you need it when there's a truck coming.  You want the horn right there.  You know, you drive...  Truck!  You don't have that with an airbag.  You have these little crappy rectangular horns up in the corner.  What the hell is that?  It's not a horn.  It's a chiclet. 
[03:56:00]  Sounds like your voice.  And it's not the same when there's a truck coming.  It's like, truck!  Fishing around for the buttons, were you?  Oh, dude.  I'm going to die in two seconds.  My car has a G-spot and I can't find the damn thing.  Another funny wrap-up.  Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Jim Norton.  Thank you very much.  All right.  My name is Jim Norton.  Hey, gentlemen.  My name's Jim Norton.  Did you hear the desperation of the audience just wanting to go along with him? 
[03:56:30]  I know.  Like he did this horse-hit horn thing and they're just going, boy, we like him, but he stinks.  Come on.  Listen to me.  This is what stinks about him.  Everything is so profound.  What I'm about to say is gonna rock your world.  But it's in this voice.  I have an airbag.  Does anybody else have an airbag?  Oh, you do?  Applaud for yourself.  Shut the fuck up.  This thing's dangerous, people.  And then he ends it with...  Can I ask Jimmy something?  When we did this a few weeks ago, do you have anything to say to the old Jim Norton? 
[03:57:00]  Good job, kid.  I enjoyed talking to the old Opie.  It was like therapy.  I yelled at him.  Let me tell you something.  Throw him out of the gondola of that balloon.  If I could sit down with the old Jim Norton, I'd be gentle.  Okay.  I'd say, look.  You're funny.  Stop being such a worm and begging.  It's embarrassing.  You are begging.  You're humiliating yourself.  If a joke doesn't get a laugh, bask in the silence for a moment and move on. 
[03:57:30]  Patrice wants to say that to the Jim Norton now.  Then Norton did a post-performance interview.  Which has never aired, by the way.  Seriously, you deserve to be fucking taken under a porch and blown some guy.  You deserve to be molested with that stupid voice.  Ouch.  That's hurtful.  We're just trying to have fun here.  What happened?  Why don't you yell at him now?  Why would you want him to be molested? 
[03:58:00]  Because he scares me, Rich.  What?  Because I know he's the real deal.  Oh, he's the real deal.  Whoa.  I wouldn't fuck with Bobby.  Exactly.  Don't leave Carl and Carl alone.  Bobby has the psycho in his eyes.  You kick him in his bad fucking knee and he's back on the ground.  I got a good knee now.  I got a brand new fucking ACL.  Oh, you do?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You don't understand.  Bobby goes to fucking a doctor to keep from beating people up.  Yeah.  I got that a long time ago.  Bobby has that psycho look like I could identify with.  I don't think Bobby's that scary.  Shut the fuck up.  I'm joking. 
[03:58:30]  Give him a look, Bobby.  Give him a look.  It doesn't do anything.  I can't get him.  I used to crack.  I used to crack in Harlem.  He doesn't scare me.  Yeah, but you suck dick for us.  That's true.  And then when you were done, just for fun.  Yeah, you put on Daisy Duke, you faggot.  One of my favorite stories ever, Bobby.  I got to give it to Rich.  One of my favorite stories ever.  She's trying to be tough.  I wouldn't hit you because I don't hit women.  Now he has a polyp on his liver.  Oh, jeez.  His kidney's growing in here. 
[03:59:00]  All right, here.  Here's Norton doing a little post-performance interview.  All right, five, four, three, two, one, six, seven.  I know me, too.  I'm both sitting up.  Jim, thanks a lot for being here.  Thank you.  Reminding you to sit up, the bad posture.  Yeah, like a comma.  Exactly.  I can't believe this is your first television show.  You did a great job.  Yeah, it felt good.  It was just, it takes a little bit of getting used to, like, looking up at the audience  as opposed to looking straight ahead like in a comedy club.  But I had a great time. 
[03:59:30]  They were great.  Good.  Wasn't too hard, huh?  No, no.  It was good.  You just can't curse.  You got to, like, edit yourself as you're zipping along.  But they were good people.  Hey, who was that?  Zipping along.  Who was the interviewer?  You were zipping along.  I don't know.  Jill Nicolini.  You have to look up instead of straight ahead.  I just, I hate, if you can see the video, I'm really trying to be, like, this charming  guy who's comfortable on television.  No, no, you are.  I got to see this.  How come she said, thank you for having me sit up or something?  Actually, she was probably sitting up straight or something like that. 
[04:00:00]  We were just both on these benches or these stools.  Oh, and she looked at your hall?  Oh, I'm just asking.  I couldn't get it.  I knew what she just did.  You think I didn't know you bailed out of a joke and made it serious?  Well, no, no, no.  You just sat up.  I'm talking to you like I'm your fucking neighbor.  Dumb tricks.  That's so funny.  Motherfuckers trying to comedy tricks on each other.  We got more of the interview.  Well, how long have you been doing stand-up?  About five years.  About five years.  That's not very long then? 
[04:00:30]  No, I started when I was 21.  I was working in a warehouse, and I just, I always wanted to do comedy.  You know, Richard Pryor, 1980.  I wanted to do, I have to plug Pryor.  If he's watching, I wanted to do comedy since I saw him.  How did you realize you had that talent?  Oh.  You're the one who gave him MS.  That's really embarrassing.  How can he, a guy that had a style that you had, dedicated, you know, like.  Well, I didn't rip him off Pryor.  He was just the one that knew he wanted to do it.  Not that you ripped him off. 
[04:01:00]  I'm just saying you would think that the style would be more conversational.  If he was an influence, that doesn't mean he's supposed to do Pryor.  Not that he was supposed to do Pryor.  No, you, you, you.  It's like, it's like Brian, Brian, Brian, Brian Regan.  Right.  Is like, if you go, man, I like Brian Regan, you can see where, you know.  What did Patricia say, and I get, it's like, why would you be more conversational?  I mean, he's, Norton sounds like he's selling elixirs.  Because he was still, he was still working on his shit, man.  Well, buy this and it will cure everything. 
[04:01:30]  The flu, the cold.  Here you go.  Try this.  It works for me.  He's still trying to work out his shit, man.  Your wagon just takes off.  All right.  I mean, I had a vision when I first got into radio, but, you know, it took a while to  get there.  At least I come off, my interview was charming.  Yeah.  And here I go.  And you plugged Pryor, too.  Let's go back to it.  Zip to him.  How did you realize you had that talent?  Failing in school.  Failing in school.  Getting thrown out and winning class clown and the whole nine yards. 
[04:02:00]  Right.  Yes, I was a failure in school, and that kind of showed me that I had something other than  scholastics to work for.  Okay.  Well, what do you like most about doing stand-up?  It's like, I'm a quick fix junkie.  It's like, you know immediately if you're doing well.  You know immediately if you're not.  All right, hold on.  I'm going to go to my stuff.  Acting or anything else, which is another type of a skill you don't know until it's released.  I like that because I want to know now how I'm doing.  Patrice.  Are you a quick fix junkie?  Hold on.  How aggravated do you get when people come up to you, were you the class clown? 
[04:02:30]  All right?  And you just admitted going, I was the class clown.  You threw that stereotype to the whole fucking world.  You got to get off the quick fix, son.  Listen.  You want to know how you're doing?  You stink.  Here's your quick fix.  Immediate.  You suck.  Nobody likes you.  You're a piece of shit.  I'm listening to Bob in the mirror.  Positive affirmation.  Dude, you're garbage.  Your therapist doesn't even like you.  Dude, you deserved it. 
[04:03:00]  You spun that around quick, didn't you?  He certainly did.  He zipped that one around.  I'm surprised.  He's a quick fix junkie.  My lungs are crazy.  Finally, the last part of the interview.  Personally, I mean.  What do you like least about it?  Being judged by an audience.  I don't even mind bombing.  I mean, I don't mind that.  But I hate when, like, you tell a joke and a crack is, uh.  The heckling and that kind of.  Yeah.  Or if they're judging a joke.  If you don't think it's funny, don't laugh.  But don't groan at me.  Because you know you're going to go home and rent Scarface anyway.  And it's a tough thing to do.  So they shouldn't be judging you.  Well, yeah. 
[04:03:30]  I mean, if you don't like something, I can accept that.  I just don't like being, uh.  You know, that.  I got what you said.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  Where do you get material from?  Try to get it from my own experience.  Um.  If not, I'll just watch Comedy Central and steal.  Don't do that.  Now, if you weren't a set-up comedian, what do you think you'd be doing for a living?  I've been in the White House before.  And, uh.  Probably that.  I'm very lucky.  You know, I'm very grateful to, uh.  To be where I am right now.  Where is that?  I don't know what I'd be doing, to be honest with you.  It was like, I know I wanted to do this since I was a kid.  So it's either this or nothing. 
[04:04:00]  Right.  Well, you're on the right track.  Thank you.  Good luck to you.  Thanks for being here.  Appreciate it.  Okay.  Absolutely appreciate it.  Actually, this is nothing.  What an asshole she is.  Like, she's a little.  She doesn't really know what she's doing.  She's a little twat.  The fact that you just compared that set to Scarface.  The fact.  A classic.  Compared to that fucking heel.  You should be at kids parties blowing up balloons with that voice.  Okay?  No, I wasn't.  I wasn't saying that.  I was only saying that when they judged material.  I can't believe my point back then went over his head.  I wasn't judging you. 
[04:04:30]  I'm exaggerating.  I know what you were doing.  It's a joke.  Anthony laughed.  Shut up.  You should see my Charmy face though.  I want to see that video because I just.  Is it up on the site?  Watching Jim in here sitting through that.  His head was slightly down.  He put his forehead on his hand and just had his eyes shut.  You really cannot.  Certain moments of that.  No one can sit through that.  I know.  We couldn't either.  That's why it was fun to watch.  Some people don't bother me.  I just laugh at it.  Other parts I'm like, oh, you. 
[04:05:00]  Because they're revealing as to what a little douche I was.  Richard Pryor.  Yeah, yeah.  Richard Pryor.  He's watching.  This kid's good.  What's his name?  When we played our audio from 12 years ago, I went home depressed.  Did you?  Yeah.  I really thought I had something 12 years ago.  I had nothing.  Oh, my God.  I went home depressed.  Yeah, but he grew.  I'm glad you said that, Opie.  I'm not even fucking kidding.  No, but I'm glad you said that in comparison.  That was Opie's way of saying, hey, we all stunk when we was younger.  Yeah, that's fair.  You stunk.  I did. 
[04:05:30]  More than all of us.  It wasn't.  No, I will not accept the ending of that.  We can stop it with I stunk, but not more than all of you.  All right.  Listen, we got to do one of the day.  Don't look at me, you cocksucker.  Why?  I can't look at you.  You're right here.  How do I not look at you?  Everywhere I look, there you are.  Straight ahead and in the peripheral, all at the same time.  Oh, shit.  That's right.  You're eating up my perif, kid.  Oh, man.  Maybe you should use your high-pitched voice to pop me. 
[04:06:00]  What?  Oh.  Kicking.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fucking shattered mess.  How are you doing?  All right, listen.  We got to do line of the day.  And we got six runner-ups.  Wow.  It could have been a lot more than that.  SkiColoradoNow.com for info on great deals.  On 26 world-class resorts and up-to-the-minute snow conditions.  Log on to SkiColoradoNow.com.  Here is a runner-up line of the day.  He dresses as nice as he has to at any given moment. 
[04:06:30]  I'm trying to maintain something.  Patrice, if you get on all fours, we can play Hold'em on your back.  That was funny.  People are surprised I was funny.  Because there was a big delay.  Wait a minute.  Oh, he's...  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  I mean, y'all can step it up a little.  He doesn't look like every black guy on Easter.  Let's start doing the plugs in between these.  Let's go with Rich. 
[04:07:00]  You get the first one.  Catch a rising star Rhode Island this weekend.  Comedy Central special Friday night.  Very good.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  Did they just go to Silhouette?  They did once for you.  It was called an eclipse.  That was a trick line.  Yeah.  Very nice.  Jimmy was spinning him around on you today.  He really was fast.  Yeah.  And how psyched are you that we don't have to do a show tomorrow?  I mean, we'll be here and all, but, you know.  Oh, I know.  This should carry over for a while. 
[04:07:30]  We could just be completely lazy.  You got a plug?  I got a plug over in Cleveland there.  I'm going to be at Cleveland February 20th to the 24th.  That's Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  Fuck.  Where?  No shit.  How many shows is that?  I think it's 85.  What club?  Say what club.  I actually have to do it.  Improv.  It's at the Cleveland Improv.  Cleveland Improv.  February 20th to the 24th.  Call.  Ugh.  Jesus. 
[04:08:00]  That looks like Bobby's head.  Again, the Cleveland Improv.  February 20th to the 24th.  Go to Clevelandsomething.com.  God damn it, Jimmy.  What's wrong with your asshole?  Get a bidet.  Let's do another runner-up line of the day.  I didn't even know to give him an A, B, C, or D.  What, he gave him smiley faces?  What does this mean?  I got a cue.  You got a cue.  Right. 
[04:08:30]  How did I do?  I gave you an upside-down boomerang with a line to it.  Right, right.  Oh, my God.  Everyone's getting their test back, and they're going around the room.  I got a unicorn sticker.  What does that mean?  It was a mushroom.  Right.  That was a group effort there.  Patrice.  Plug time.  I'm at Stand Up New York this weekend.  78 and Broadway.  The number is 212-595-0850.  Very good.  Everyone's talking about the HBO thing.  Everyone in my life. 
[04:09:00]  Def Jam?  Holy shit.  They loved it.  Yeah, very funny.  Thank you.  The fucking Dice line.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, my God.  It's on On Demand, too.  It's still on On Demand.  Episode 94.  Yeah, I pushed it a couple times in my crib.  What are we up to?  One more?  Oh, two more.  Shit.  Another runner-up line of the day.  Bob looks like a clown as you're trying to figure out what shape it is.  That was a great one. 
[04:09:30]  And another runner-up line of the day.  That was a dueling plug.  Yeah.  Wow.  Stupid did well.  See, he can improv.  Plugs.  I wish he could improve.  Yeah.  That's a great line.  That was a good one.  And Jimmy's going to be in San Francisco.  He's not going to be here on Friday.  I think Kelly is going to sit in.  Yeah.  I'll be at Cobbs Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  And my whole tour is on sale.  Seattle, Detroit, everywhere, man. 
[04:10:00]  Just go to myspace.com.  Jim Norton.  Details, ticket links everywhere.  Denver, Pittsburgh.  Fucking, I'm all over the place.  Coming up.  Very cool.  I also have a plug.  What?  Believe it or not.  I just want to say, fuck you, Rick, you ungrateful fuck.  Oh!  Thank you.  Here's your line of the day.  Here comes line of the day.  Line of the day. 
[04:10:30]  Tempur-pedic pillow.  How's it going?  That was a good one.  Oh, good.  That was a hamburger one.  You guys got to loop that, man.  That's got to be loose. 
[04:11:00]  That is fantastic.  Just loop the fuck out of that.  You should loop that and dub over like pussy-eating audio.  Momi.  Oh, that's so fun.  All right.  Let's do the quick out, guys.  This was a lot of fun.  Yeah.  Good job today, Rich.  Thank you for having us.  Yes.  What do you mean?  Exactly.  Oh, fucking, I'm not... 
[04:11:30]  What's it?  Just say it.  Oh, Rich.  I'm not fighting again.  Don't be mad, Rich.  I'm not mad.  I came out fucking...  I'm not fucking...  You're not angry with Opie.  I saw the face you made.  Didn't you see he was, like, really mad at you?  Yeah, right, because I fucking kill on these things.  I have a couple bad lines.  That's them going...  A couple bad ones.  Oh, you can't come back to...  You plant a siege with these fucking mutants that listen.  The message...  Oh, that's a good way to do it.  That's a good way to do it.  Get on the air and call them those fucking mutants.  That's brilliant.  I don't say one bad thing about you on every message board.  That's brilliant, Rich. 
[04:12:00]  They know.  They know.  Look.  This is Greg Hughes, the actor that plays Opie on The Opian Anthem.  What a privilege.  I haven't made an appearance in a while.  Now, listen to me, I've said it many fucking times, that you're hilarious.  All right, and in school...  You're hilarious in all the comedy clubs, and you're really funny on the show as well.  Thank you.  It's just your thing.  We beat you up, because you show some stupidity every now and then.  Right.  Yeah.  But I don't want people to be confused like you suck on a stage.  Not at all.  Two hours the other night. 
[04:12:30]  You Jew motherfucker!  All right, back to Opie.  Now, this fake handicap of yours.  Huh?  This fake handicap of yours.  We're going to discuss this on a later show.  Fake handicap?  You mean this retardation?  It's real.  In his baby hands?  This guy...  Oh, my God.  This guy loses his ball.  He'll look for it for an hour.  No fucking way, man.  He'll find a ball that obviously was hit in the woods in 1979.  You're fucking crazy.  All of a sudden, he's playing a different brand of ball with a fucking scar in it.  And he's claiming it's his ball so he can fucking keep his night handicap. 
[04:13:00]  I'm crazy.  First of all, I got a 13.  You're fucking nuts.  Jesus.  And I still hold a grudge, because my fucking head is all fucked up stills.  Oh, really?  You want me to bring in the fucking x-rays of my elbow, all right?  Every morning I wake up, I'm in pain, okay?  I can't help you.  You're 53.  Yeah, okay.  I'm sorry that I fucking...  How about a four that time?  So I got chipped one into his frigging hand?  Right.  Thank you, Anthony.  What's that?  Sorry you chipped one into his hand? 
[04:13:30]  Oh, sorry I almost got thrown off the stage.  And my fucking...  At least his is in pain.  I have to sleep with my arm, Alex.  If I see my arm bent, I wake up in fucking pain.  Did that ever heal?  Did that ever heal?  Huh?  My favorite Rich Voss thing that we did to him...  I mean, we fucked with you today again.  Today was a classic.  That was great.  But listen to me.  The best one ever was when you were looking all pretty for the fucking Miami show.  You had cologne on and new jeans and a new shirt and I dragged you out on the stage. 
[04:14:00]  And we fucked up your set, which we try never to do, by the way.  We understand the line.  We fucked up.  But it was hilarious to watch you breathe heavy for half of your set.  You were soaked from the water that was poured on you by everybody else.  Yeah, it was nasty.  Fucking thrown off the stool by Jeff Norris in your fucking studio.  Almost fucking snapped my neck.  Thrown in a fucking pool.  And he has my own pot.  Fuck you!  Let me tell you what I bring to the show. 
[04:14:30]  Who didn't fucking stand up on the stairs in D.C.?  You did, yeah.  Come on, start speaking, Voss.  All right, you want to let it out.  Preach.  Let it out!  Fucking...  Let it out!  You're just trying to throw your fucking arm.  A 13 handicap.  I'm a 13.  10 foot putts are not gimmies.  Listen to me fucking...  What?  Ouch.  You know, if it's not my handicap, oh, because I make some sandwiches for my buddy. 
[04:15:00]  Which one is creepy?  Did I eat your stupid sandwich?  No.  Good, I'm glad.  I brought you a shirt.  We fucking made you sandwiches?  Yes.  He the fuck eats sandwiches that another man makes for them.  First of all, when I play fucking golf, I don't need to...  It was creepy.  It was nice, but creepy.  Did he cut the corners off?  It was all cut up nice.  Were they in wedge?  We'll bring a pigeon wedge, and we'll chip over Bobby into a neck.  All right?  That's hurtful. 
[04:15:30]  That was pretty funny.  Yeah, it was good.  See, I can take a hit.  You take one hit, you fucking curl up into a ball.  No, please, I take hits all the time.  I don't mind taking hits.  But when someone says, oh, you're not allowed to do these, fuck.  Dude, I was fucking joking.  But they don't know it.  Who's they?  Who's they?  Who the fuck is they?  The people in Rushmore.  There's people that speak Brazilian.  How do we deal with this?  Rich, stop reading that shit. 
[04:16:00]  That's what makes your life a lot easier.  Just stop reading that shit.  He thought Mount Everest was in Seattle.  There's no way to combat that.  Like, once you realize that, you understand that...  First of all, he didn't think Mount Everest was in Seattle.  Mount Everett.  And he thought there was a Mount Everett.  He wasn't even thinking about the Everest that it could have been.  Oh, no, he was thinking of the major.  Wait, where was Bobby appearing that weekend?  You know what, Anthony?  I love you, Bobby.  You know what, though?  You're not really...  You have, like... 
[04:16:30]  Your body, Anthony, is like a retired astronaut.  Oh, shit.  So why don't you go to the gym?  I'd rather be this than that.  He's got guns.  Show him your guns.  Show him, man.  That's a zip gun.  You know what?  I've seen B-Arthur has the same heart.  We're going to have to redo Line of the Day.  A lot of good ones.  Bonus Line of the Day. 
[04:17:00]  Retired astronaut.  Now we turn off the mics, and we all go our own ways, and no one talks.  And no one talks, DJ.  That's amazing.  And Patrice is leaving early, so you don't have to deal with this shit.  He's well-dressed.  You don't want to be seen without bums.  People don't understand.  As soon as these mics go off, it's like, hey, we don't even know each other.  It's like the coyote and the...  Yeah, the sheepdog.  When they punch in and punch out.  Wait, do you know, Bobby called me yesterday.  He was in my neighborhood.  He was going to come over.  And I'm looking at this thing, and I'm like, do I pick up and see him, or do I just jerk 
[04:17:30]  off?  I did pick up and see him.  He actually said that to me.  He goes, I go, I'm in the neighborhood.  And I was going to the doctor for this thing that I needed to, you know, all this stuff.  And he's like, well, I might jerk off, so I don't know if I want to come over.  At least he's honest.  Yeah, I really didn't know if I wanted his company or just to fucking strap it in a load  from picking a Craigslist.  Something you do like 20 times a day.  It's amazing.  Or his company.  But I took his company.  Yeah, it was good.  We had a nice talk.  Very nice.  Yeah, let's get the fuck out of here.  Yeah. 
[04:18:00]  Someone turn off the lights.  We're done.  Ron and Fez at noon.  Noon to three.  Bye.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  I'm in radio because I don't like radio, Jimmy.  Oh, I'm sorry.  No.  I love radio.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. </pre>
