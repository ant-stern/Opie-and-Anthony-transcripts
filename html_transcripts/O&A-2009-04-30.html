<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with the hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy, expressing furious outrage at their treatment by SiriusXM management, specifically citing “Steve Blatter.” Their complaints centered on poor studio sound quality due to other shows improperly adjusting microphone settings, a lack of respect shown to their show’s standing, uncomfortable furniture, unreliable equipment, and a complete absence of communication regarding scheduling and technical issues.  They detailed instances of unauthorized studio use by other shows, causing significant disruptions to their broadcasts. Callers contributed to the complaints, one requesting studio time to make a mix CD, another pointing out an audible buzz (later identified as a nearby, accidentally-mic'd TV).  The hosts also railed against perceived unfairness in listener surveys and internal metrics, citing a "bandwidth problem" affecting their audio quality.  Opie added personal woes, detailing problems with a newly installed pool at his house.  The segment concluded with vows to address their grievances with management.

The show then transitioned to a critique of a SiriusXM listener poll, arguing its flawed methodology grouped wildly disparate shows (including Opie and Anthony, Jamie Foxx, Jim Brewer, Ron and Fez, categorized under "etcetera") rendering meaningful comparisons impossible.  A caller, Brian, described an encounter with a SiriusXM representative who seemed unfamiliar with their show.  This led to a mocking discussion of the swine flu pandemic, juxtaposing alarmist news reports with Jon Stewart’s more measured coverage.  A recurring bit involved repeatedly “phone slamming” a listener named Ray, falsely claiming his family perished in a propane explosion.  The hosts lamented the missed opportunity to interview Hugh Jackman, who was present in the building, attributing the failure to unseen "middle management" and "wizards behind the curtain."  They contrasted Mexico’s shutdown due to the swine flu with the comparatively mild US outbreak.  Listener calls, a 1976 swine flu PSA, a Jon Stewart clip, and a listener-submitted parody song punctuated this segment.  The segment concluded with promotion of Opie’s comedy gig and upcoming guests Bill Burr and The Iron Sheik.

Theoretical physicist Michio Kaku was the next guest.  Their conversation, ranging from antimatter and future cell phones to humorous anecdotes (including Kaku's acid-induced hallucination of a face on a hot dog), quickly veered into tangents.  Comedians Rich Voss (promoting his upcoming shows at Comics on May 1st and 2nd) and Bonnie McFarland were also mentioned, with the latter’s presence countering the hosts' professed (potentially untrue) dislike of female comedians.  An email about a Comics lineup change, specifically Jim Norton's absence, sparked debate on its implied blame.  E-Rock’s story about Sandy Koufax being a Rich Voss fan led to a playful guessing game and revealed a potential upcoming golf game between them.  Discussions about the swine flu, illegal immigration, border control, voter fraud, and a scathing review of Peter Frampton's "Frampton Comes Alive" (comparing it to Kiss and The Who, and devolving into broader discussions about various bands and personal anecdotes) further filled this segment.

The show then heavily featured Boston, starting with a remembrance of Brad Delp’s suicide.  The hosts and crew played and critiqued Boston songs, interspersed with discussions on other bands, music tastes, and drug experiences.  A phone-in segment followed, with one caller mentioning a YouTube video titled "Drinking from Cups," featuring animated visuals of a lizard and audio purportedly from an acid-tripping person locked in a closet.  The Iron Sheik, a professional wrestler, entered the studio. His interview was a chaotic mix of profanity, insults, boasts about wrestling accomplishments (focusing on Hulk Hogan and The Ultimate Warrior), promotion of his roast DVD (mentioning Scott Hall’s drunken near-fight at the event), and homophobic and other offensive slurs.  He recounted a physical altercation with The Ultimate Warrior and his manager, Eric, and culminated in partially exposing his genitals to E-Rock at the hosts' urging.  The interview covered his drug use, his health, and further offensive remarks.  The hosts repeatedly emphasized that the segment was still on air.


The following segment continued with the Iron Sheik as a guest, his rambling, vulgar anecdotes dominating the conversation.  He boasted about his sexual conquests, discussed his strained relationship with Vince McMahon (using homophobic and antisemitic slurs), his dissatisfaction with WWE earnings, a cancelled book deal (due to controversial content on drug use), and further homophobic slurs directed at Hulk Hogan.  He openly admitted past cocaine, opium, and hashish use.  He discussed his relationships and rivalries with other wrestlers, including Sergeant Slaughter and his sadness over Chris Benoit's actions, complained about his finances, and blamed his manager for poor management of his earnings.  A highly discussed moment occurred when Iron Sheik urinated in his pants. The hosts reacted with shock and humor.  Promotional plugs for his appearances and merchandise concluded this segment, followed by a brief interview with New York Jets player Nick Mangold.


The final segment featured NFL offensive lineman Eric Mangold. The conversation focused on Mangold’s NFL experiences: on-field violence, team fines (for infractions like running the ball back incorrectly or scoring for the opposing team), encounters with dirty players (including a specific instance of groin-kicking retaliation), and players he respected (including Big Daddy Wilkinson and Junior Seau).  The hosts interspersed comments and questions, often using profanity.  A brief discussion of Bill Burr’s upcoming comedy shows and final banter between the hosts and Mangold concluded the broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of radio shock jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their audience.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good?  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  I had a dream, and it was obvious that I had a new friend, the President of the United States of America.  Well, you don't have to go too far to analyze that one.  Yes, you're five.  How would you judge Jimmy as a lover?  Ten.  Out of? 
[00:01:00]  A hundred?  Three hundred.  The internet's going to become the magic mirror of Snow White on the seventh floor.  And if you look at Pinocchio.  Look how he has to talk to us.  The Opie and Anthony radio show, the most popular show in the history of satellite radio.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi.  A very busy, very, very, very busy day.  We busy today? 
[00:01:30]  I don't know.  Oh.  It just sounds good when you're starting a radio show.  Damn.  Just say it's going to be a very busy day.  At least that sounds good.  Unlike my mic.  Yeah, wow.  Listen to this tinny fucking mess that this microphone is right now.  Oh, shit.  Every fucking morning.  This could be the worst my mic has ever sounded.  Wow.  It's a tin can.  Who was using the studio yesterday?  Wow.  God fucking damn it.  That's pretty bad.  Yep. 
[00:02:00]  Oh, my goodness.  Hey.  Hey.  Have you tested before?  Hey.  Hey.  The problem is people are using the studio after we're gone and they tweak everything and  then Mars has to try to figure out what the fuck they did and put it back to where we  like it.  How it got all fucked up.  It says Opie and Anthony on the glass.  It's our studio.  If you're borrowing our studio, then you got to use the studio as is.  Why are you tweaking anything?  It's not even supposed to be borrowed.  It's supposed to be a dedicated studio.  No shit.  Of course, excluded.  No shit.  Nobody else is supposed to be in here. 
[00:02:30]  No shit.  It's just supposed to be.  Same shit.  Different bosses.  There's a couple different shows that have been booking the studio.  Yeah.  Booking.  How?  How do they book it?  Because they need the time.  Yeah.  You have to book studio time no matter what.  Obviously, this show and Ron and Fez don't, but after 3 o'clock, the studio has been available  for booking.  For booking.  I know that a NASCAR show has been done out of here.  But that's not what they call.  What the fuck is Bob calling people? 
[00:03:00]  Bob sucks.  Bob ain't going to talk to anybody.  We have to deal with it and we have to do it.  It fucks the beginning of our show up almost every day.  Every day.  We were ready to go into the swine flu and something Jimmy wanted to talk about while  he was in a cab today.  Oh, boy.  And Blatter keeps telling me, no, no, it's only you guys, Ron and Fez.  And do you mind if Eddie Trunk and Brewer use the studio from time to time?  Like, yeah, they're cool and they're not going to fuck with anything.  But it's obvious that more people than the ones mentioned are using the studio.  Yeah. 
[00:03:30]  I mean, I don't know if it's still going on.  I know that last week when I checked the studio schedule, I did see some other shows  in here.  The studio schedule.  You mean there's like a schedule of people that, a list, like the brown list?  There's a list of people that use this studio.  Well, every studio, like if someone has to do some voiceover or if there's another show.  I was told that I have to actually book this studio for Saturday Night Fires.  What?  I have to book it.  Why are they telling us that we have a dedicated studio?  You know, enough with the lying.  We've been doing this radio thing for a long time. 
[00:04:00]  Sit us down and say this is what's going to be going on.  You have to book this studio for a Saturday night, which is a show that we put on the  channel.  Yes, it is.  What else is here that could be conflicting?  I don't know.  I just almost dropped the fucking N-bomb.  I swear to God.  I just said we are treated like fucking.  And I was.  Of course we're not nice people.  It almost blasted right out of my fucking mouth because that's, that's the culture I  grew up in.  But I swear to God, this is fucking ludicrous. 
[00:04:30]  Why do we get treated like, like fucking shit?  Always have.  So why should things, you know, change?  Oh my God.  This is the worst.  They smile at you.  They look at you and fucking smile and then stick a big shiv up your ass.  Ugh.  Blow me.  Anyone with a tie, blow me.  I've had it.  I'm going to go get a tie.  All right.  Make one out of my dick.  So what was in here last night? 
[00:05:00]  I don't know.  I can go check if you want.  Go check.  Go check.  Let's find out who was sitting in our little seats doing a little radio show from what  amounts to our fucking studio.  Right.  And why they couldn't do it from the multitude of fucking studios in this fucking place.  Maybe the smaller ones.  Maybe this.  This wasn't built to be the community fucking studio.  Who else has to lend their studio out?  Does Howard?  Of course not. 
[00:05:30]  I mean, I understand, you know.  Why would he have to do that?  How is the big fish here at Sirius XM?  At Sirius Satellite Radio.  So, but, you know, you shouldn't.  Aren't there other studios available?  Like that one or that one or some other fucking one?  Let's look.  They should look at who the subscribers really subscribe to.  You know what I mean?  They should look at who the.  That's a good one.  Oh, my God. 
[00:06:00]  They should look at who the subscribers are subscribing to.  And if you're, you know, tenth down on the list, that's where they start renting your  fucking studio out.  If you're tenth or worse, you have no say in it and the studio fucking gets rented out.  Other than that.  And Mars, is there any reason for anyone to be down there fucking with shit during their  their show here when they rent out our studio like a hobble?  I guess the talent will want the mic to sound the way he wants it to sound so they will 
[00:06:30]  make adjustments.  He doesn't get that.  He doesn't get that choice if he's borrowing our studio.  Especially if it sounds like shit.  Right.  It's like having some guy come in that's using a rental car and tuning the engine and fucking  just completely fucking it up.  So it runs like shit and going, well, they wanted it to run like shit.  No, it works.  It's the way it's supposed to be.  I'm processed so fucking thin and high right now. 
[00:07:00]  I swear to God.  It's very distracting.  I just, it just gets, you know something?  In ten minutes I could get used to it and just be fine.  But then tomorrow morning we'll have to get used to something different.  That's the problem.  And now we're, you know, bitching and the listeners hate it.  I get it.  But what else are we supposed to do?  Oh, fuck them if they're fucking wah-wahing.  What else are we supposed to do?  I fucking, uh, job and this is part of it that I hate.  Go to your own fucking job and hate the taste of cum in your throat. 
[00:07:30]  You fuck dick.  Ugh.  Who was in the studio?  People.  Unfortunately, according to this grid, it says that nobody was in here.  Liar, liar, pants on fire.  But that just means that it wasn't ever, like, booked, like, through the system that it's  supposed to be booked through.  Why are things different?  I think people would come ahead and do that.  I mean, what I'm saying is, you know, that doesn't necessarily mean that no one was in  here.  Mars is, uh, you're pretty much in charge of the studio, right, for now?  Uh, and hopefully, hopefully you continue being?  Right, hopefully.  Um, but the thing is that things happen at night when I'm not here.  That's what I'm saying.  I'm not blaming you. 
[00:08:00]  That's what I'm getting at.  If you're the guy that's responsible for the studio and you did nothing, see, we're doing  a little investigating right now.  Right.  And you did nothing between, uh, the Ron and Fez show and our show, then someone else  is doing something in the studio.  Right.  Absolutely.  And since it's not, uh, booked in the schedule, whatever it is, it's called.  It's called a schedule.  Is it called really?  That form?  England?  You're not from England.  You're Puerto Rican or Hispanic.  It's called schedule.  No one says schedule.  No one says schedule.  Schedule.  It's schedule. 
[00:08:30]  Schedule.  Lord Mars from Worthington.  Lord Mars.  So since nothing was booked there, I'm going to have to say, um, and I'll,  probably throw myself under the bus.  There were engineers in here.  Why?  For what reason?  I have no idea.  I mean, I mean, why would an engineer then come in to just fuck the sounds of the mics  up?  Well, I don't think the intention was to fuck the mics up, but maybe to try to make it  better for some other show, whatever have you.  I don't know.  I would love an answer to this.  I really want, this is one of these bureaucratic pass the buck by 80 fucking people in this 
[00:09:00]  God fucking place as to, uh, uh, who did this.  We'll never find out who came in and physically turned a knob that fucked up the sound.  I'd love to know who the fuck was in here.  Look at some time cards or whatever.  Time cards.  Time cards.  How old are you?  The punch clock.  Ting.  Unbelievable.  Totally believable. 
[00:09:30]  Completely believable.  Completely.  Can we get a padlock?  Of course not, right?  We wouldn't be allowed to lock the door on our own studio.  On our own pad?  It's not our pad.  No, it isn't.  There's a lock?  They humored us by putting a logo on the glass, but let's be honest, it's everybody's  studio.  Well, I mean.  Whores.  If we want to look at who was in here last week, we could do that.  I mean, maybe they just didn't book the same studio.  And let me, hold on, and it was told to me that this studio will be for you guys, the 
[00:10:00]  Opie and Anthony show, Ron and Fez, maybe Brewer when he's in town, although he has his  own studio, but I guess they might free up that one eventually, and Eddie Trunk, who  does.  And NASCAR, and the football show.  No, no, no, that's what I'm getting at.  Hold on, because people are going to get confused.  Hold on, hold on.  People are going to get confused.  You fucked me up.  Oh, my God.  I was told this studio will be for Opie and Anthony, Ron and Fez, Brewer eventually, and 
[00:10:30]  possibly Eddie Trunk.  That is it.  And you're telling me who was in here last week?  NASCAR, the football show, and blue collar radio.  And a voice tracking session.  Yeah, and a voice tracking session.  Oh, there you go.  Voice tracking.  Isn't that great?  So that's different than what is being told to me, Steve Blatter.  That's different.  That's very different.  Not only that, somebody was in here last night doing something.  Maybe not a live show, but somebody was doing something in here. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, obviously.  Dials.  Dials and knobs don't just move themselves.  Which is very different than what was told to me, Steve Blatter.  So please get to the bottom of it.  And if this is what's going to be going on, then tell us that's what's going to be going  on.  Don't just fucking, you know, bullshit us.  Tell us.  Yeah, by the way, you know your studio?  It's just going to be used by any fucking, it's like a cum dripped whore that's just 
[00:11:30]  laying there waiting for somebody else to fucking lay into it.  Look, we're making the best of what they did for us.  We're not happy with what you guys gave us, but we're dealing with it.  We certainly don't want it to be even worse than what we thought it was going to be.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  We pretty much shut up and said, all right, the studio's a little small, we'll make the  best of it.  We got some TVs and, you know, we'll just deal.  But we don't want to deal with more bullshit.  Rolled with more fucking punches, man.  I can't even take it anymore. 
[00:12:00]  Ugh.  La, la, la.  Check, check.  One, two.  Now you're going to get check, one, two.  Check, one, two.  Check, check.  It's still fucking tinny, thin, and rattling.  The sound is so high-endy that it's like rattling.  It's EQ'd like dog fuck.  Oof.  Holy shit.  We'll do check, one, two on our show.  Check, check.  Check, check, one, two.  Check, one, one, one.  There, you get the check, one, two show.  And if I see one fucking guy with a tie telling me, the show this morning, maybe you should 
[00:12:30]  have fucking, you know, done some, could have done that off the air.  Blow me!  Blow me!  Fuckers!  God, I hate you all, motherfuckers.  I look you in the face, I fucking smile, cause it's my job.  The second I walk out of here, I just talk about how I fucking hate you all.  You could suck my fucking dick. 
[00:13:00]  Me and Jimmy, too?  Getting shit on.  No, I'm talking about the fucking management.  Oh, you made us-  And suits and those cunts.  You made us sad for a moment.  Fuck you, Zoll.  We look down.  Cocksuckers.  Lying motherfuckers, all of them.  Lying, bullshitting motherfuckers.  Always have been.  Just lie through your fucking teeth at us again.  Always have.  Ugh.  Always will.  Disgust me.  Always have.  Not one honest motherfucker in this place.  Oh, everyone.  Run for your jobs. 
[00:13:30]  Your mic's off.  Run for your jobs, motherfuckers.  Your mic's off.  I don't care.  Good.  Leave it off.  I should just fucking go home at this point.  Run for your job suits.  Lie to everyone so you keep your fucking gigs.  Cunts.  You're all cunts.  God fucking damn it.  I would love to see you on the unemployment lines.  You're looking down-  Fucking douchebags.  You're looking down an empty hall, though, Anthony.  I'm just waiting to see one of them come trotting up.  They're not gonna trot up.  With his shiny shoes and his worthless stock options. 
[00:14:00]  Fuck you.  Die.  Don't forget the designer glasses.  That, too.  God, am I in a fucking tizzy now.  Fucking shit.  Wow, you never spit.  I spit all the time.  Never.  He certainly does.  I've never seen that outside of a casino.  Yeah.  Well, I feel like a loser in here.  Well, we've been lied to again.  What can I tell you?  We just continue to take our beating. 
[00:14:30]  Check one, two.  It's fucking a morning show.  Check, check, check.  One, two.  Is this good?  Are the listeners still here?  Are they still fucking here?  I would tune out in a second if I had to listen to a fucking...  I leave a bar when a band is doing it.  I don't even fucking...  For free admission.  Hey, I got a good idea for Danny.  Give me a drum.  I'll just go...  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on. 
[00:15:00]  Get a drum for Anthony.  I got a very good idea.  They said that we need to book the studio for the Saturday Night Virus.  Go book our studio forever.  Book it forever.  Just forever.  Do it every night forever and see what they say.  No, for real.  Put in a request that we're booking our studio Monday through Sunday 24-7.  Do it forever.  Just write forever.  All right.  Holy mother of God.  And all we'll hear later is, I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it. 
[00:15:30]  I get it.  I get it.  I get it.  I get it.  I got it.  I get it.  I get it.  I get it.  I get it.  I get it.  I got it.  And get this also.  When you scramble for a meeting, I'm not going to be at your fucking meeting.  I don't want to go to a meeting.  What meeting?  I don't need a fucking meeting.  You know who you need to meet with?  All right.  You're hearing my side of it.  So you don't need to meet with me.  You need to meet with the fuckers that are fucking the shit up.  So meet with them and I'll be on my way home. 
[00:16:00]  Hello, podcast.  Fuckers.  The future.  I'll tell you one thing.  The future.  My mics sound beautiful.  Holy shit.  And not one person goes down there.  Danny isn't going down there twisting knobs fucking it up.  Travis didn't go in the basement and fuck my knobs up.  And I go, one check, one two.  How great would that be if you came home to your own house and there was another show in  your basement?  Another show's in my basement.  I wouldn't be surprised if these motherfuckers.  We rented out your basement. 
[00:16:30]  With like a really liberal Keith Olberman backdrop.  To the completely.  Oh, how infuriating that would be.  Oh, you.  And the guy just shoos me away to shut the door.  Get upstairs.  It's pretty sad that you're building a much better facility in your basement than what  we got here.  At least it's a lot more predictable, which is the most important thing.  The most important fucking thing in a studio is predictability.  It's just to be able to know you're going to come in the next day and have the same fucking 
[00:17:00]  sound or at least comparable than you have the day before.  Right now I have, hey, hey, check, check.  It's getting a little better, Mars.  I don't know what you're doing.  I bypassed the process.  You bypassed it?  You bypassed the process.  Why don't we bypass the fucking studio?  And just give me a Mr. Microphone.  He has to bypass the processor.  So I have no processing on my voice.  I got to put automatic processing on just by talking closer.  What does processing do? 
[00:17:30]  It gives your voice some balls.  It actually makes your voice that's going into this microphone and going through all  this electronic gibberish sound like it's not going through all this electronic shit.  Okay.  And you can take that high end out of it.  It's almost like an equalization.  Can someone get video of people using our studio?  Please.  I want to know who's using our studio.  You know, I walk around these halls and there are morning shows going on right now.  And I go, who's that?  Oh, blah, blah, blah, blah in the morning. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, who's that?  Oh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah in the morning.  I'm like, I never heard of any of these people.  Video camera right there.  Right outside of our studio.  All right.  Go talk to Bruce and find out who was in our studio last night.  See who came and went out of the fucking studio.  Because that's the other thing that's weird around here.  They're obsessed with surveillance cameras.  Yeah.  You can't do anything without being on camera.  Oh, Sam had a really good story about the security in this place.  What?  Apparently, his chick was here on Saturday when they were doing the Sam and Dave show.  And he had gave her her ID card to come in. 
[00:18:30]  And I think she was pulling the door instead of pushing it or whatever.  And all of a sudden, a voice just came from above that said, try pulling.  And she was just like, thanks.  And then the voice went, you're welcome.  So they could pick up sound even in the lobby by the elevators.  I didn't know the sound, too.  What the hell, man?  Oh, man.  That means you can't even say anything.  What happened?  What happened to this business?  What happened?  I've worked in a million different places.  We never had surveillance cameras. 
[00:19:00]  You know that you can't walk out of here without at least three or four cameras, like, picking you up, Anthony?  Picking up your every move.  Oh, I know.  Picking up your every move.  And words.  And words now.  Well, now watch what you fucking say.  Words.  Words, too.  Really?  Ugh.  I could be in a little bit of trouble for some of the things I've said in these fine hallways.  Are we ready to broadcast?  God damn.  Yeah, yeah.  We'll give it another try. 
[00:19:30]  We will give it another fucking try.  It seems like that sounds better.  Yeah, because there's no processing on my voice.  And I can still hear it's fucked, but.  Are you annoyed?  Yeah, yeah.  You're annoyed like I am.  We're just sick of being shit on.  I'm so fucking sick of it.  The product we give the fine folks out there doesn't equal how people handle us and take care of us.  And it's always been like this.  You know, if we weren't one of the, and I'm not, I'm not, I'm not always patting ourselves on the back or anything,  but if we weren't one of the top shows on the fucking platform, and I know we are, I've seen fucking research, 
[00:20:00]  then I say, treat us like a bucket of crap.  Go ahead.  We'll build ourselves up, paying our dues.  What am I, paying my dues to the doggy station?  Fuck you.  I paid my dues.  I should have to walk into a studio where some fucking shithead from the NASCAR channel is changing my settings.  Is doing a vroom, vroom show.  Yeah.  Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom. 
[00:20:30]  What, do you want to get the fucking microphones to sound like they're running exhaustless headers?  So that's what it fucking sounds like.  I put tin cans on the end of my headers when I was a kid.  Sounded great.  Not a microphone.  I heard your microphones in your basement are better than these, too.  Dude, they, oh yeah, the quality of the mics themselves are fucking great.  They're industry microphones.  Why can't we get industry microphones here?  I don't know.  This one, why don't we get the Real Rock TV one you were holding?  That fucking game show microphone from the 60s.  Bob Barker microphone.  Bob Barker's microphone. 
[00:21:00]  I didn't know how to hold that thing.  Someone's like, you really hold that microphone weird.  Well, it's, you know how small and thin and light that thing was?  I was trying to talk into a dog dick.  It's always fun to do that because the dog just, he moves his little paws and he's so confused.  He doesn't know what you're saying.  He's used to being scooched on the stomach with a fingernail.  Said you're pinching his dick at the shaft really hard and yelling test.  You know what's weird?  When we first started on satellite radio, people said, well, we're going to give you your own studio.  I'm like, all right, cool. 
[00:21:30]  And this is how it works.  And then they're like, do you mind if Ron and Fez use your studio?  We're like, no, they're really good friends of ours and we've been with them off and on for forever.  For God's sakes, we got them fired indirectly.  So we're like, no, that's fine.  And then a little more time goes by and then it's like, well, do you mind if this person use your studio?  Ah, no, all right.  And then a few weeks later, do you mind if blah, blah, because, you know, the other studio, there's always a reason.  Next thing you know, we're just a shit show. 
[00:22:00]  Being just sharing a studio.  Trotted on.  Like we're in college radio.  And guess what?  We don't like this studio.  We're making the best of it.  Yeah.  I'm not going to sit here and make believe.  Wow.  Look what they did for us.  No, the studio is a third of the size of what we're used to and what we had.  It's adequate for us to do our show in.  And we haven't bitched about it.  We're like, all right, we'll be team players.  We're moving over to the big building.  We'll make the best of it.  And for the most part, if you've been listening for the last three weeks, we barely have mentioned how small this fucking studio is. 
[00:22:30]  But now we got to deal with other shit on top of that?  Fuck you.  I don't want to.  You are so bounced and banned.  I don't want to.  Bounce and ban, motherfucker.  Bounce and ban.  Yes, Danny.  I don't want to make anybody extra angry, but I'm also noticing a very, very slight buzz.  Yeah, I hear the buzz, too.  Oh, there's a buzz.  I hear the buzz.  You hear that?  Oh, yeah, I hear the buzz.  It's just fantastic.  I hear the buzz.  It's great.  That's fucking great.  Is that buzz a piece of equipment on in the background? 
[00:23:00]  No, I don't think so.  No, that's some internal fucking electric.  Yeah, it's not a background noise like air conditioning or.  Let's listen to the buzz show.  The buzz show booked the studio, by the way, for Sunday.  So if you just want to listen to this, tune in on Sunday.  Well, let me say hi to Rich in Florida.  I have to rise above now and be professional.  I guess.  Rich in Florida.  Rich.  Hey, what's going on, guys? 
[00:23:30]  Welcome aboard, Rich.  Hey, I hope I don't seem like I'm intruding on you guys, but I'm going to be in town in  like a week, and I want to know if I can come into the studio to make a mix CD for my  girlfriend.  That'd be cool.  You might as well.  Please.  Might as well.  You can book it.  I always get really gassy when I come up to New Jersey and New York and everything, too,  so if you know, it's probably going to stay.  No worries.  Yeah, just fart into it.  As long as you're not paranoid, because as soon as you walk in the building, 28 cameras  will pick up on you and start moving around and following you every move.  Just say hello, Hal.  Yeah, no kidding. 
[00:24:00]  I'm sorry.  I can't do that, Dave.  See you, man.  Booby-trapped the studio.  Ant, don't worry.  You're a millionaire.  It has nothing to do with that.  People don't understand that we have passion for what we do.  Let me tell you something.  It has nothing to do with that, Steve.  It's just I want to come in here and be able to do a show.  I want to come in, turn the mics on, and talk about things that we were talking about before 
[00:24:30]  the show started.  I don't want to click the microphone on and go, hey, well, great.  That sounds like shit.  And now it's a complete distraction for what we wanted to hear.  Let's say hi to Mark in Georgia.  Mark.  Yo, hey.  Hey, thanks for touching base, Mark.  What's up, Mark?  You know, I'm doing my best.  Hey, listen, I'm listening to you guys right now, and you just mentioned that word, the  buzz, and I'd flick stations to three other stations, no problem, crystal clear on an  XM satellite. 
[00:25:00]  I can hear that buzz over the satellite.  Stations that three people listen to are crystal clear and have dedicated studios.  Well, I also heard, and I'm not really sure, maybe it's time to bring it up, that our channel  sounds weak at times.  Of course it does.  Mars is thumbs it up.  They borrowed bandwidth from it.  Why the fuck does our channel sound weak?  Borrow bandwidth from the fucking bastard shithead children of XM.  They got to go, Jimmy.  Absolutely right.  They say that sometimes during some parts of the day, our channel's a lot weaker than 
[00:25:30]  a lot of the channels.  Yeah.  I compared it.  What is that about?  I compared it to another show, and they're consistently.  What, Howard's show?  Of course.  The Polka channel needs all of them.  Consistently higher than you.  Of course it is.  How much fucking bandwidth is flowing over there, I bet.  Oh, I bet there's bandwidth to spare.  Over here, they squeeze it down to a goddamn 1960s Marbell telephone line.  Number, please.  Number, please. 
[00:26:00]  Did someone wake up Steve Blatter?  Is Steve working on that?  Where's Steve?  Get Steve.  Hopefully his alarm goes off to this show.  Where's Steve?  Get Steve.  That would be wonderful.  Steve, where's Steve?  Get Steve.  Where's Steve?  Oh, God.  I'm just infuriated.  Thank you, Danny.  Danny doesn't make me chuckle.  Uh, Steve.  It's Thomas Alva Edison.  That's what the show's recorded on. 
[00:26:30]  It's his little wax tube recorder.  Little cylinders.  Did you wake up Steve Blatter and tell him?  I sure did, and I've already been working on the other issue.  What's the other issue?  Ah, just your chair thing.  Minor, but I'm taking care of all that stuff.  What chair issue?  That's no big deal.  I know.  That's a request for a better chair.  Who cares?  I know.  But yeah, I've already done it.  I'm not going to blow everything out of proportion.  Going from this to the chair, Steve, keep the chair out of it.  It's almost like, hi, we're in a firefight and running out of ammo, and I need a new potato 
[00:27:00]  peeler.  Yes.  I'm getting the flag stickers for your helmets sent to you.  Yeah, exactly.  They're not...  I know.  We're under mortar attack, and we need some air cover, and by the way, I need a sock.  And just to explain, these couches in here are the worst couches ever to sit on, and  this has nothing to do with Sirius.  XM bought those for us, and they suck, and we told them they sucked from day one, but  there's a really comfortable lounge chair over there.  So I said, Steve, go get the lounge chair. 
[00:27:30]  So that's not an issue.  No, it's not.  It's not an issue.  It's our chair, and we're going to bring it over.  Who cares?  Were you in here last night doing your show, Priorities Wrong?  No, Jim.  So we have a bandwidth problem.  No one can hear the show.  Oh, yes, I put in the thing for shinier keyboards.  He'll be here shortly.  What?  The cup holders you requested will be here in six weeks.  That, I'm all right on it.  So what did Blotter say?  He hasn't called me back yet.  Who?  You left a message? 
[00:28:00]  I'm going to keep calling him, and I've sent emails, because God forbid you don't put  everything in writing.  I hope so.  So he didn't answer his phone?  No.  I sent him an email, too.  All right.  Oh, my God.  I keep calling.  Oh, brother.  This is just more piled on.  If you can't get him, I want some Windex for the studio windows.  Blue Healer writes, nobody uses my cubicle when I go home for the day.  Yeah, right?  Just imagine that. 
[00:28:30]  You got your space at work, and then the next day when you go to work, everything's different.  There's other people's babies' pictures up on your cubicle.  Would that infuriate you, or what?  Your computer's different.  You had Windows.  There's Mac in there now.  It's just...  And the head of security has been contacted to inquire about the video feeds to find out  who was in the studio.  Ah, fabulous, Fester.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  It's just more insanity.  He comes in with a chair.  Steve, he's nuts.  What is he talking about?  And I'm working on the chair. 
[00:29:00]  I'm working on that other major problem.  That's a chair.  That's just sitting at our old joint.  It was pretty much like, if you have time, look to see if our old chairs that we used  to sit in are laying around.  If they are, see if, in time, they can be brought over.  That's exactly what I said.  The microphone problem is, oh, my God, we immediately need this fixed.  The listeners never complain.  We want the guys to have comfy chairs.  They don't care if we're sitting on four-foot dicks.  Oh, I would.  Certainly would, too.  I hate a short little cock like that. 
[00:29:30]  Steve.  Yes.  The multicolored styrofoam cups are on there where they're being shipped from Runkonkuma.  But, Steve, the processing is off.  What is processing?  Yes.  I'm in the process.  We're getting new cups.  What did he say yesterday?  He came in with some urgent thing.  Oh, yeah.  I forgot already.  He needed to let you know that Colin Quinn was aware.  Oh, yeah.  He goes, Colin Quinn's finishing up on Howard's show, and he's aware that he's doing your  show. 
[00:30:00]  And I'm like, our show, excuse me.  And I'm like, all right.  Why did you have to come in?  Colin has become aware.  Like it was an urgent message.  And he has his Bluetooth and his pads and everything else he's carrying these days.  Colin Quinn's aware.  Aware of what?  Self-discovery, I think he means.  He now has awareness.  It's an existential discussion.  What the fuck does that mean?  He's aware.  I'm asking, where is he? 
[00:30:30]  He's aware.  Oh, I meant to say he's a bear.  It's like the old question.  If a man's in a closet and he yells, and no one hears it but mothballs, and the guy's  cocky-sucking.  Is he really producing?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Why do we continue to be treated like shit?  I don't know.  I don't get it.  I go home and I try to figure it out.  It's just a complete lack of any, I don't even want to use the word respect, because I 
[00:31:00]  don't give a shit about that part of it.  I don't care much about that anymore either.  It's a different thing.  It's kind of...  We just get stepped on over and over again.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Eh.  I guess it's, you know, they want it to be more like real work and stuff.  They want it to be like, you know, a job where you come in and you're like, this is  your job.  Because it was much too much fun to come in and entertain people and have a good time.  So they got to just cheese it up with some fucking bullshit. 
[00:31:30]  I'm not going to spread the wildfire, trust me.  But when this was all going down with the merger and we're coming over here, we were  promised a bunch of stuff.  None of those have come true.  No, I know.  And I'll just say that much for now.  Yeah.  I just want them to know that I'm aware that what was said to us...  Yes, Opie's aware.  I just want the person that told us all this stuff that should be done with us, none of  it is happening.  My eye is twitching.  None of it.  The corner of my right eye is actually clicking and twitching now. 
[00:32:00]  I have information on who was here last night.  No, the visine you needed.  I'm getting it for your twitch.  Boo.  Boo.  That was the worst two pieces of information ever.  A boo.  Well, there you go.  And that's on top of...  Like, this is just like...  This is a giant part of the iceberg.  This is the bottom of the iceberg. 
[00:32:30]  The tip of it was like...  I swear to God.  And the pool company that I work with is going to get the worst commercial.  I swear to fuck.  If somebody doesn't answer their motherfucking phone, get over there and do their goddamn job.  What's the matter?  I'm not asking for, you know, gratis over here.  I'm paying these...  I paid them giant amounts of money to put this fucker in.  And apparently all the water that was in there in the winter disappeared. 
[00:33:00]  A whole built-in pool full of water went down the big drain in the middle and ended up somewhere.  Wow.  Because I guess a valve was fucking opened or something screwed up.  Where's the water?  I don't know.  It's an entire built-in pool's worth of water.  Where is it?  That didn't happen in Luke Costello's house.  Tommy Lee's.  You know, there's just been a kid down there going, hey, help me out of here.  You know someone in the...  Send down a rope.  You know someone in the neighborhood has a flooded basement right now. 
[00:33:30]  I hope so.  And they're trying to figure out where it came from.  I sure hope so.  A bunch of surfing worms 40 feet down.  Hey.  I knew my throat.  But then, you know, the guy's supposed to come over, open up the pool, and then do other things.  When they put what's called the...  I'm just laughing because Steve is now wandering down the hall with like...  Scrolling?  I think he's talking to himself for real.  Just hold your pool thought because I think he might have an update.  He just had a fake phone up to his head, and I think he was talking to himself. 
[00:34:00]  He's actually trying to do, like, looking for security cam footage and edit out him walking into the bedroom with a drill.  Were you just talking to yourself?  I don't know.  Was I?  I'm not aware.  You have an update?  Yeah.  Nobody was authorized to use the studio.  Oh.  That's wonderful.  The only people that are authorized to use the studio are the Opie and Anthony Show and Ron and Fez.  The Blue Collar Comedy Channel, NASCAR, or the NFL Channel were not in this studio. 
[00:34:30]  And even though they were on the grid, were taken out and were not permitted to use the studio.  Well, somebody turned a processing knob to make it sound like a tin can.  It doesn't mean that people weren't in the studio, and that's why I am asking the head of security to find out who was here.  Who's coming in.  All right.  So those guys were booked but didn't actually do the show.  Correct.  Okay.  Maybe a bitch, and then he went, all right, and moved.  All right.  Well, maybe that's a good thing.  Maybe.  I'm sorry. 
[00:35:00]  All right.  Well, so far.  It's not my issue today.  It's ants.  Oh, my God.  It's an ant issue.  Yeah.  Here's the deal that really is bugging the shit out of me at home with that fucking pool also.  Now that I'm just so pissed.  You know this is all about a pool and it has nothing to do with a stupid microphone.  I am so pissed.  I knew there was something else under.  Believe me, it's all bubbling.  Under the surface of this thing.  Last year when they put the pool in and they put that final coat on, you know that when they put a gunite pool in, it's not a liner. 
[00:35:30]  It's actual, you know, the cement, the gunite.  And then they put in the diamond coat, the dust, you know, looks real nice and sparkly and everything.  They put that in and it fucking looked like, like the pool was 10 years old when it was done.  Stains, all kinds of shit.  And I'm like, this is a new pool.  And it's the end of the summer.  So I figured, you know what?  I can't have him drain it now and try to fucking fix it.  I want to use it.  But next year, and I told the guy and he said, yeah, of course, of course, next year the pool gets drained and we'll acid wash it or do whatever the fuck that needs to be done. 
[00:36:00]  We had to go through a third party, me and Keith.  A third party to even find the motherfucker to tell him that we need him to come over.  He wasn't answering his phone and I swear to you, I'll send you this, this, a copy of this show unless you're listening or somebody tells you because you know who the fuck you are.  You will get pests calling you and fucking your business for the entire summer if you don't fix my shit. 
[00:36:30]  I swear to God, you will get the worst commercial you've ever gotten for a fucking shyster pool company.  I want them over there because now I want him to drain the fucking pool and fix it so it looks like a new fucking pool.  But there's no water in your pool right now.  Yeah, exactly.  I was a little in the bottom.  Maybe your house is infested with mice. 
[00:37:00]  Thirsty little mice.  Anthony's 5,000 canteens are missing.  Maybe you have no idea, but there might be thousands of mice that come out at night and drink from your pool.  And suckle from my skimmers.  You know what it is?  This whole thing just brought it all together as a fucking just incompetence that goes on.  There's an incompetence that goes on, a complete lack of customer service, a lack of just service and courtesy or anything. 
[00:37:30]  I don't even know what the fuck it's called.  That's why in the end you just got to be self-employed.  I didn't think it was possible.  I'm just selfish.  And that's why.  Oh, we all know that.  But this is why.  Because I've gotten to the point where I'm like, fuck everybody.  Why should I give a shit about anyone else?  And when I say anyone, I don't mean the players of this program.  I do have a deep affection for everybody on this show, less one or two.  You just don't really want to hang out with us. 
[00:38:00]  But, no, believe me.  And the truth of the matter is, I'll be honest.  God, if I was a drinker, though, we would be best pals.  I know that.  I know that, dude.  Believe me.  No.  I'll be honest.  When you lived on Long Island, it was so easy.  With you in the city, all I think about when I'm done is getting the fuck away from traffic  that is building by the minute.  Yeah.  So I just get out of Dodge.  We're barely in the same area together.  Like when you guys were hanging out, you know, I would have liked to have gone down to dinner, 
[00:38:30]  but you were fucking three blocks away.  I can't tell.  It was a mere 11.  I'm going to be out of Long Island today.  I'm going to stop by Anthony's house and calm him down.  By the abode.  Because there's a whole thing going on because I wasn't at your birthday party.  Oh, is there?  Oh, yeah.  Just shut your fucking mouth.  Shut your fucking mouth.  You have no fucking idea what goes on when this show is over, you assholes.  What birthday party?  Stop trying to figure out shit.  Oh, Jimmy.  This proves that they are officially breaking up.  This proves they're going their own ways. 
[00:39:00]  This proves blah, blah, blah.  They don't even follow each other on Twitter.  Will you shut the fuck up?  I don't.  Stop thinking you know something.  You don't know shit.  I'm following the wrong Opie on Twitter.  Dude, I look at your Twitter every day.  I officially am not following you because I don't really use – like Twitter is all about following people,  but even the people that I'm officially following, I'm not looking at their shit for the most part  because you have to have some people to follow or Twitter shut you down. 
[00:39:30]  So then what I do is like, oh, I'm not following Jimmy either.  I just – oh, I'm going to check out Jimmy's account.  I'm going to check out Anthony's account.  And a lot of people are doing that without following people.  How come you don't follow us?  Because I don't look at that.  But that would be good for us to promote.  No, I look at your – it's a technicality.  I'm seeing your stuff every day, but officially you're not on my follow list.  That's my latest Twitter.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  See, now that made me happy.  Why don't you bring those in and we'll get some shit done?  We'll get some fucking business taken care of.  We'll get some business taken care of if you bring that shit in. 
[00:40:00]  Those are matched Ruger .45 pistols, two of them.  I had a drive to Bohemia to get them yesterday.  Nice.  I'll talk about that a little later.  What a birthday party.  Great experience.  Well, the other problem is like Anthony doesn't officially invite anyone,  so then you get weird.  Like you start sending him texts like, I don't know, am I invited?  Should I show up?  Like you're bad.  Well, here's the thing.  You should get someone to officially invite people.  There was somebody.  Because that's a problem too because every once in a while something comes up 
[00:40:30]  and you're like, I don't know, am I invited?  Should I just show up?  Who's inviting people?  I'll write a text.  But here's what it is.  You're not a good party planner for having a party house.  Well, let me tell you something.  The birthday was mine.  I don't plan my own party.  So what happened was –  I didn't even know if it was officially a party.  I didn't either.  To be totally honest with you, I thought it was like,  Well, sometime this weekend, come over and say hi to Anthony for your birthday.  Because that's exactly what I thought it was.  When Sal called me up, he goes,  Hey, Anthony, your birthday's Sunday. 
[00:41:00]  Your birthday's Sunday.  And me and Ro and Joe and Dawn want to come over and celebrate it there.  Is that okay?  And I'm like, yeah, come on over.  I'm not doing anything.  I wasn't doing anything for my birthday.  And then I swear to you, it was Saturday night that I pretty much heard,  Oh, there's people coming over?  And by people, I mean other people besides Mom and Sal.  Right. 
[00:41:30]  I just thought we were going to hang out or something like that.  And I'm like, no, it's cool.  I love having people over.  But I didn't – it wasn't an invite thing.  It was just kind of a who knew about it and who was coming over.  Yeah, I understand now.  I had no idea people were going over your house on Sunday.  I guess Ange?  Well, tell her to send out a fucking email.  We're human beings.  We like to see, ooh, you're invited to a party.  Bring your party hat.  Look how tussleable I was.  And little Joe on the left.  I had to be picked up to cut the cake.  I didn't get into it. 
[00:42:00]  So, so, so.  Yeah.  So, so.  So, so, so your pants.  But, you know, they got to do the right thing here.  We should summarize.  Do the summary.  Summary.  Summary time.  Now I've talked enough where I'm used to the shitty sounding microphone I have,  so it's okay now.  To surmise, fix this shit, and then don't let anyone fuck with it.  And could you please kind of look at what we bring to the platform and treat us accordingly? 
[00:42:30]  I mean, really.  Really?  Really?  They don't even realize, like, if they just treated us accordingly, we would be the best employees ever.  You better get your head and your ass wired together, or I will take a giant shit on you. 
[00:43:00]  And that might be a shocking statement right there, but it's the truth.  We've never been treated accordingly.  No.  And we've always delivered for the companies we worked for.  I know.  Always.  And they just.  Always.  Shit on us.  Even at CBS, we did our jobs, believe it or not.  Because some people like to go, oh, you failed.  No, we didn't fail.  We did our jobs.  We did our jobs.  The other 23 hours of the fucking day that was failing miserably. 
[00:43:30]  It's a fact.  We did our jobs even in that situation.  Yeah.  But once again, just treat it like shit.  You treat us accordingly to the product we're delivering.  We will be.  We will get the employee of the month every effing month.  I would love that.  You will have to make plaques until your asshole hurts.  Yeah.  Wonderful.  And they don't understand that.  Oh, these guys are trouble.  These guys are always blowing it up.  These guys are always bitching and complaining.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If you treated us accordingly to the product we're delivering, we would be the best employees. 
[00:44:00]  It's so obvious, too.  And don't think we mean we want pats on the back.  No.  We want this.  We want anything special.  I don't want anything special.  I just want shit to work and to, you know, just, yeah, not be treated like shit.  Isn't that amazing?  It's just, could you please just not treat us like shit?  They could have so easily knocked down a wall here and gave us a big space.  So easily.  I walk around this place.  Half these studios are empty most of the day. 
[00:44:30]  Half of them.  Yeah.  And then the other half are filled with morning shows.  No offense to these people because they're working hard.  That no one knows about.  Yeah.  They really don't.  Mm-hmm.  Are they building a following and going to get to a place someday?  Possibly.  Could be.  Could be.  Oh, God.  Unbelievable.  All right, now we're going to take about a 40-minute break and then maybe we'll be back.  That's what I say today.  We might be back.  We allude.  Jimmy wants to talk about what he heard in the cab.  Actually, do it before the break, Jimmy, because it's a quick one and it kind of goes 
[00:45:00]  with what's going on.  But don't rush.  It's just, when I get in the cab, a lot of times they're listening to Z100.  Oh, Mars.  And they do their little.  The cabbies love Z100.  What, Mars?  I found the buzz.  This mic was on on the television.  Oh, my God.  Hold on.  It's gone.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's gone.  Good.  All right.  Thank you, Mars.  We were micing a television set.  All right.  Our fault.  I'm so glad you needed to tell us that as Jimmy's launching into the first bit. 
[00:45:30]  I am actually glad he did because that was one we have to take the hit for.  Don't mic the TVs.  Note to self.  Note to self.  I got in the cab.  They listen to Z100 in the morning.  And the Z100 does those phony phone scams.  They're corny, but, you know, whatever.  You know, the fucking audience is 15-year-old Spanish girls getting ready.  They think it's cute.  All right.  Fair enough.  So I'm listening to it.  We all know they're fake because you have to tell people they're on the radio.  Yeah.  You have to.  It's inside scoop. 
[00:46:00]  You have to.  It's the rules, you know.  So the phone scam is over.  It was actually one where the father and the son with some credit card thing.  And at the end it goes, the following, the preceding phone scam has been prerecorded and all parties had given consent, like at the end or something.  Whatever.  They give the disclaimer at the end.  I'm thinking, terrestrial radio, what the fuck reason would you have for doing that?  Like, I understand internally you have to get permission.  It's legal.  Why do you have to tell your audience that? 
[00:46:30]  Why do they need to know that?  That it's fake.  Like, why do you have to put that fucking, that scumbag lawyer spin on it?  Yeah.  It blows me away that the lawyers and management of regular radio just don't get it.  Holy shit.  Honestly, and I've said this a million times, it's mind boggling.  Because if you have to do that to keep it safe and tell all the parties, like, look, you know, we're going to record this and blah, blah, blah.  Like Jimmy's saying, why would there be a need to actually air that?  Because then it takes away from the bit itself.  And the parties themselves know. 
[00:47:00]  Right.  Because when you're listening to a prank call on a radio show, you're like, holy shit, that person got fucked up.  But then if they have a disclaimer, you're like, what, they knew and what?  But what's the use of, why do you need to have that air?  Like, I understand why you have to talk to the people themselves.  Oh, yeah.  If you got to do that behind the scenes.  Because some lawyer figured, we better put that on so that people know.  And, you know, if someone heard that and a lawyer got involved.  Anthony raised a good point, by the way, about people getting fired. 
[00:47:30]  All these guys at Clear Channel.  Oh, my God.  And you don't hear about what was it?  You don't, it's all on-air talent.  Again, it was on-air talent.  And the engineers, so the machine breaks down or we break down.  And other, you know, people that are related to the shows going out over the air.  Oh, boy, those guys in the ties.  Oh, do they just keep their jobs?  They could fuck up by the numbers.  You saw it at CBS.  It was the same thing at CBS.  And that's a Clear Channel station. 
[00:48:00]  And they're wondering why they're going to fire another, what, 600 people in the coming weeks?  600 people.  They can't figure it out.  It's so obvious.  The mistakes they're making.  There's going to be a point where it's just a bunch of executives sitting upstairs in offices going,  wait a minute, we don't have anything left that we're actually making or selling or putting out.  It's like, what do we do here?  No, everyone's fired. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, my God, am I going to lose my job?  Well, you have nothing to manage anymore.  Do they release, like, for Clear Channel, CBS, or any of the major radio things, because they have to give accounting setup.  Do they have the salaries of the executives, what their position is, and their salaries?  Oh, I'm sure that's somewhere.  It's probably available in some kind of a quarterly stock report.  Why don't we get those?  I'm just curious.  Why not?  I mean, it's obviously, you know, radio personality salaries are very public knowledge for the most part.  Sure.  The other thing, is there some kind of poll or survey they're doing? 
[00:49:00]  Poll up our ass.  A lot of people are saying, XM Radio online or XMRadio.com, what are they doing?  Some kind of poll, asking the people what they listen to?  Polls.  And we're shoved into the comedy category with a bunch of shows?  Yeah, like with Blue Collar Comedy, I think, and Jamie Foxx Channel and stuff like that.  Of course.  Why would you be giving your own?  That's good.  You know, we've been working on branding the Opie and Anthony brand for 15 years, and it's good to know that we're just shoved into a category with a bunch of other shows. 
[00:49:30]  Do you listen?  We're in the do you listen to comedy part of a poll.  That's good.  Well.  Jesus.  Part of a, I think part of that.  But how does that help anybody?  Wouldn't you want to know, you know, what shows people are listening to?  We're in the talk, entertainment, and news.  Do you listen to, here's your choices.  Howard Stern is his own guy.  And then comedy, including Uncensored, Opie and Anthony, Jamie Foxx, Jim Brewer, et cetera. 
[00:50:00]  We're in a category with an et cetera.  Holy mother of fuck.  Wow.  And then everything else is pretty much their own entertainment, gossip, sex, and relationships, home and health, Martha Stewart.  We're in a category.  And whatever.  We've been trying to build this brand for 15 years, and we're still just a category.  We suck.  No, we don't.  Not in our eyes, but in our eyes.  That's not what that's about.  Let me tell you what that's about.  Okay.  Let's just word this carefully. 
[00:50:30]  Let's just say that this show does particularly well.  Right.  Okay.  I'm not saying it's the biggest show in the history of it.  Jay said that.  Let's just say this show does particularly well.  And let's just say you're not the person that – let's say there's other shows involved which would be made to look better.  And now this is not counting Brewer because Jimmy's doing a one, I think, once a week show now.  But let's just say the other things in the et cetera will look better if they incorporate this show's numbers.  Exactly.  Ah.  It makes –  It's all lumped together, so if people look at it and go, oh, Opie and Anthony, let me click on this, even though I don't listen to this or this or this or the et cetera. 
[00:51:00]  Right.  I listen to the et cetera show.  So the et cetera show –  Can you guys vote for the et cetera?  We don't need the votes.  Just a write-in poll.  Write-in vote.  And the et cetera show looks better because it incorporates this show's numbers.  And also if this show is lumped in with other ones, then this show having particularly high numbers, well,  it's also lumped in with A, B, and C.  Right.  So this show doesn't look like the numbers are quite as high. 
[00:51:30]  It's a good way to keep a fucking boot on the back of our necks.  Yeah.  And I'm not being paranoid that that's common sense because –  Believe me.  I agree wholeheartedly.  It's very transparent and obvious.  Most polls suck, but I don't really understand what they're doing with that poll.  I don't understand.  There's no advantage.  I don't understand.  No, none.  Because let's just go with our category, Opie and Anthony, Jamie Foxx, Jim Brewer.  So how do you know how many people are listening to Jamie Foxx?  Or Blue Collar.  How do you know?  And you mean to tell me –  How do you know if they're voting for that category because they like us? 
[00:52:00]  Or how do you know – I'll do it the other way.  How many people are listening to us if they're voting for Jamie Foxx?  Which, by the way, are two completely different radio shows.  Yeah.  Us and Jamie Foxx.  Lumping them together.  Completely different audiences.  Completely.  We share maybe a small percentage of listeners.  Why can't they just have a bunch of checkboxes for every show?  What's so hard about that?  It's building a website that has a checkbox for every show you could absolutely do.  And then if you wanted to know a certain genre like comedy, you could take all the separate comedy things and see what numbers they got. 
[00:52:30]  And then add them together and say, okay, we have a comedy genre and it's getting this.  But each individual show is doing this.  Why not do it that way?  Why is that so hard to do?  It's not hard and it was very calculated.  Of course it was.  You know who the Etcetera is, by the way?  Who's that?  Ron and Fez.  They don't get it.  How's Ron and Fez not getting a mention?  They don't even make the name.  They're Etcetera.  Etcetera.  How do they not get a mention?  They're on every day. 
[00:53:00]  No offense to our pal Brewer.  Brewer's doing one day a week.  I think it's once a week, yeah.  Three or four hours.  Ron and Fez are just slaving away every day.  And I think they're part of the Etcetera, part of that equation.  Well, they're not, they're XM leftovers like we are.  Thank God there's one show that gets shit on more than we do.  Ron and Fez.  Thank the Lord.  We can look down at them and go, ha ha, you're bigger pieces of shit than we are. 
[00:53:30]  Do you understand?  They have to actually catch a train from their office to the studio.  Fucking silly poor guys.  Brian, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, when I called up to sign up for my serious satellite radio, they asked, like, you know,  what are you calling up to listen for?  I was like, Opie and Anthony.  And they're like, what is that?  They're like, you need to pick a type of music.  You're kidding, right?  Please say your name.  No, I'm not.  I was like, no, seriously. 
[00:54:00]  I signed up just to listen to Opie and Anthony once they got canceled from K-Rock.  They're like, yeah, that doesn't count.  They're like, do you listen to a rap or a pop?  Do you listen to et cetera?  That's what they were.  No, they didn't even say that.  It was some Russian lady who barely even spoke English.  Well, the subscriptions are farmed out.  I mean, they're done by, like, a third-party company, I think.  Those are the ones you call.  Yeah.  Like, you're never really talking to people.  I'm just speculating.  What the fuck do I know?  God.  All right.  Why don't we break?  All right.  Et cetera. 
[00:54:30]  Wow.  You can't have a website with just a bunch of different categories with checkboxes on them.  Like, you know, you go to the doctor and they say, have you had any problem with your kidneys, hypertension, blah, blah.  And there's a bunch of checkboxes and you go, check, check, check.  Yeah, yeah.  Why is that so difficult?  It doesn't go, you know, you're above the belly button, below the belly button.  Where's your problem?  Exactly.  How do you get accurate fucking reporting if you don't allow an in-depth survey?  You're talking to the, the Arbitron ratings and all that shit are hard because you don't  know who you're talking to. 
[00:55:00]  Right.  This is precisely to your subscribers.  Yeah.  What the fuck is so hard about checkbox, checkbox, checkbox, checkbox?  That's fantastic.  Yeah.  Arbitron is just like, yeah, sign this, fill this, put this, here's a hat.  What?  Who the fuck is it?  They would have done that in the heyday of internet checkbox polling.  By the way, we had another update from Sam.  Sam, a Steve update from Sam, but I guess Sam gave up because we've been bitching.  Oh, damn.  Because the Steve thing is hilarious. 
[00:55:30]  What, Danny?  This was, I guess, after the first time and before the second time he came in the studio.  Yeah.  He went to Sam and just goes, what are they talking about, water?  That's when Ant was talking about his pool problems.  Oh, God.  Yes.  I'm on it with Steve Blatter about the pool.  Is he losing his mind?  I swear to God, I saw him walking down the hall.  You talk about it like it's still happening.  He was walking down the long hall and it looked like he was talking to someone.  I'm like, oh, okay, he must be on the phone with Blatter. 
[00:56:00]  And then I look closer and I'm like, oh, my God, he's taking an imaginary phone call.  His hand was up to his ear, but there was nothing in his hand.  No phone?  No.  And he was talking.  Yeah, he's, I think he's lost his mind.  For real?  Yeah, I think maybe.  I think maybe he lost his mind.  Holy macaroni.  All right, we're going to break.  Your mic's all right?  It's good enough to do the show.  It's not, you know, processed properly, but I'm done. 
[00:56:30]  I'm done just fucking yelling for like a fucking lunatic.  All right, well.  Until the next time.  We got your swine flu update next.  Oh, what's it, being piped into the studio as a gift?  We can't do it to the people like the regular news is doing.  The swine flu is no worse than the flu, my friends.  That's all you need to know.  That's all you need to know.  Yeah, that's it.  Don't worry so much. 
[00:57:00]  We're not going to put the fear in your heads.  Let the regular news do that because it's breaking news everywhere.  But a lot of people are going to get this flu.  A few people are going to die from this flu.  But in the end, we're going to be okay.  Everything will be okie-dokie.  And that's all you need to know.  Everything will be okie-dokie.  The regular flu kills people, too.  Actually, this flu will kill less people than the regular flu.  Yeah.  That is a fact.  Which kills upwards between, we've heard, 30,000 and 40,000. 
[00:57:30]  We don't have a firm number.  In the United States alone?  In the United States alone.  Wow.  30,000, 40,000 people every year die of the flu.  No, it's weird, though, because this is a new flu, like the swine flu.  If the numbers come out that 10,000 people across America died from this thing.  Of the swine flu?  People would freak out.  People would lose their fucking minds.  They'd be running around like maniacs.  But that would be consistent, or not even consistent, with the numbers that the regular flu would take out.  Right.  Yes.  But you watch how the news plays this, man.  Oh, yeah.  You know?  They don't do this with the regular flu. 
[00:58:00]  No.  Oh, my God.  The 20,000th flu death is reported today.  We'll get into it a little bit.  The fear.  We've got to give Jon Stewart some props today.  He's been having a lot of fun with the swine flu.  And then we've got a swine flu PSA from 1976.  This thing's been around, even.  Oh, okay.  So, yeah.  Let's see what they were thinking back then.  Yes.  We'll do all that, and we'll do some more bitching for you guys in just a bit.  Bitching.  Open Anthony's Phone Slam with Club Soda Getty. 
[00:58:30]  Hi, is this Ray?  Yeah.  Ray, your family's dead.  What?  Remember that faulty propane tank in your backyard?  No.  Well, it blew the house up.  What?  They're all dead.  Oh, my God.  You've just been phone slammed.  Who is this?  Goodbye.  I'm a little teapot.  Short and stout.  Here is my handle. 
[00:59:00]  Here is my spout.  Put a finger in my backside and come shoots out.  There is the closet.  I should step out.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Oi.  Where's Norton?  Dump, maybe?  I think he's trying to get Hugh Jackman's autograph.  Are you kidding?  Well, not an autograph anymore.  A picture with Hugh Jackman.  Good luck on that one.  He's in the building.  They're ushering him. 
[00:59:30]  But we're not going to get him?  Of course not.  Why would we?  They're ushering him to another morning show.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  Yeah, so I loved The Prestige.  Let's talk about that.  Danny says The Prestige in his top five.  It really is.  In his top five.  Great movie.  I saw The Illusionist.  You saw the wrong one, boy.  That's what everyone says.  Yeah, that wasn't the one. 
[01:00:00]  I'm like, I don't want to see another magic movie.  No, Prestige is good.  But if I saw Prestige, I'd be all in.  I'm going to have to get that movie and check it out.  Oh, hell yeah.  But he's, I don't know if Jimmy's ever going to.  Is that him?  Is that Jimmy?  Why is he coming from that direction?  I can't even tell.  Jimmy is ten miles away.  Is that Jimmy?  Kenny?  I need binoculars.  Why is he coming from that direction?  Is he trying to make believe he just happened to bump into Hugh Jackman? 
[01:00:30]  Jimmy's stealthy.  Yes, he is.  He never walks that way.  He always goes that way.  I know it's a visual, but to see Jimmy coming from that direction means he was up to something.  Take your time, Jimmy.  I'm waving to Jimmy.  Now he's running and running and running.  No need.  Jimmy, why were you coming from that direction?  You never go that way.  Yeah, I know.  I wanted to get a snack.  I'm hungry.  My throat's still sore. 
[01:01:00]  Did you see him?  You want some throat coat?  Hugh Jackman.  We're suspicious that you went in search of Hugh.  Oh, actually, no.  Oh, see, that's what I thought.  No, I went into the break room.  No, why would I?  For what?  Give a fuck about him.  The claws, he'll scratch you.  Get out of here.  The claws, they scratch you.  That's good.  There's no business like you're holding it.  We got it.  Good.  No, I didn't.  I'm not going to go away.  But what if we told you he would be coming into the show, then you wouldn't care about it, right? 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, but of course, but it's like...  That's just the thing.  He's not...  He's...  If he's on a show and he's leaving, they're holding an elevator for him for what?  I'm not going to make an asshole out of myself.  It's like...  They're actually holding an elevator?  That's what I hear.  Run out of here?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They don't want him standing in that lobby little area waiting for an elevator.  Well, I think it was proposed that somebody would go up to him with a flash recorder to  get five minutes with him for this program.  Yeah.  And so we were met with a no, and now they're holding an elevator for him. 
[01:02:00]  Holding an elevator so he could just...  Well, because Sam, like, you know...  Push him down the shaft.  Sam roams the hallways and tries to get audio and stuff, so...  Yeah.  And that's not a bad idea, actually.  If he can't...  If he doesn't have time for an interview, you ride the elevator with him, you get a  couple minutes...  Ask him, well, what's the haps about Wolverine and, you know...  Promotes his movie for him.  He helps us.  Why would you want to promote a shitty movie that's getting trashed by everybody?  Why would you want to promote that?  Is that what's happening for real?  I did propose that I do an interview with him while he's riding down the elevator. 
[01:02:30]  See, that's non-invasive.  I don't know.  I was just given the word this morning that that was not going to be occurring.  Jimmy, you never find out the who of anything.  It's just, well, no, we're getting kind of a no about that.  We're getting a no.  Yeah, that's one of those things that, you know, they won't go for.  Who's they?  Who's they?  There's this vague fucking wizard behind the curtain. 
[01:03:00]  People are saying...  People are saying that it's not a good idea.  It's just this vagary that goes around this place.  Our sources are saying, but aren't you the guy?  Yeah, aren't you the guy?  I want to see the great and powerful Oz of this place, the guy that's actually making the decision.  Because a lot of times, and I know a lot of times for this show, when we ask things, it's not being bumped up to the top.  So it's not the head muckety-mucks that are saying yes or no or anything. 
[01:03:30]  So who's the middle management guy that's saying something?  How could it hurt if Sam gets a couple minutes with Hugh Jackman as he's going down an elevator?  It's crazy.  He's in movies.  What happens to celebrities, too?  I bet you there was a time in Hugh Jackman's career that he would have done a couple minute interview in an elevator.  He would have been like, oh my God, yes, of course.  Anything I could do to promote myself and my projects, I'll do it.  He's dreamy.  And then, what, you just get too big and then realize, I don't feel like doing any of that shit anymore? 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, and your handlers work you like a puppet.  All right, swine flu time.  Uh-oh.  Know why I know the swine flu is okay in the end?  Why?  Because Obama spent one minute on it during his press conference.  Obama's a liar, so he could spend a minute on it, and it could be the most important thing ever, but he just doesn't want to, you know, get into it.  That makes me think it is a problem. 
[01:04:30]  He'd spend one minute.  Pandemic imminent.  Pandemic imminent.  They're putting on the news.  We're going to be all in with this swine flu.  And meanwhile, what I'm hearing from other people are saying, no, what I'm hearing from other news agencies and whatnot is that the people that have been infected in the United States are getting better.  Because think of how long this has been going on.  A few days, right?  Mm-hmm.  So they were sick, and now they're feeling a little better. 
[01:05:00]  They're getting better.  And they're telling people to stop going to the fucking hospital when you got the sniffles.  It's not the plague.  You're going to fucking, you know, you're taking a valuable emergency room time.  Unless you have an underlying problem that the flu can really screw with, you just stay home.  Take some NyQuil and go to sleep.  And just, you know, wait it out.  But Mexico is in a complete, what? 
[01:05:30]  Mexico shuts down.  Mexico shuts down.  Can this help stop the virus?  Oh, my God.  That's what they wrote.  Mexico shuts down.  Really think about that statement.  Man, the entire fucking country shut down.  Did it really?  Exactly.  You're going to tell me that that $500 worth of gross product is not going to be made today?  I have a clear throat.  I got the joke.  Very funny.  I like the joke.  I'm going to say gross national product.  Well, where do you want to go? 
[01:06:00]  We got the swine flu fear mongering.  We got an old school PSA from 1976.  I like retro.  And we got Obama.  You want to start with what?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What swine flu is topical?  I want to start with the, I think the old PSA.  Really?  I don't know.  I want the old one.  I want to start with it.  Because that's like history of the swine flu.  Wait, I know.  Oh.  I know it's going to make you happy, Ant.  So we can move on with the show. 
[01:06:30]  I got just the cure for your.  McCain one?  No.  Well, I'm sorry.  Okay.  Sorry.  Long shot.  For you, Ant.  Oh, just a little taste.  Fry that chicken.  Fry that chicken.  Yeah.  Fry that chicken.  Yeah.  We got to fry that chicken.  Fry that chicken.  Fry that chicken.  You hear me?  Everybody want a piece of my chicken.  Something fried chicken.  Finger licking.  Everybody want a piece of my chicken. 
[01:07:00]  Something fried chicken.  Finger licking.  Everybody want a piece of my chicken.  For the fried chicken, bing-a-lickin'  Can anybody want a piece of my chicken  For the fried chicken, bing-a-lickin'  I got a pen, I got a plan  I'ma fry this chicken in my hand  I got some hot grease and a whole chicken  Don't wash your hands cause you gon' be lickin' em  Big ol' thing of fried, spice all on em

[01:08:00]  Yeah  Alright  I need a little  Just let me know when you need this  Well, if you like the You Hear Me, well, then I'm going to highly suggest Peach's second single.  Yes.  Which is called In the Tub.  We can save it for later.  We'll do In the Tub.  Yeah, a little later I want to hear In the Tub.  Because people are counting on us.  We've got to do the swine flu thing.  Let's start with the fear-mongering, I'm thinking.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay, a little fear-mongering.  I think I want to end with this to just show people that, you know, this thing's been around.  Yeah.  Because they're making it sound like this is a brand-new thing that has brand-new come around. 
[01:08:30]  The WHO.  All countries should immediately now activate their pandemic preparedness plans.  Countries should remain on high alert.  The biggest question right now is this.  How severe will the pandemic be?  Especially now at the start. 
[01:09:00]  I never want to hear that voice again.  When you hear that voice, you know something bad is happening to the world.  It's terrible.  That's like movie crap.  The WHO.  You've heard that voice in a million movies.  Yeah.  Right?  A pandemic.  Some people have the flu.  What the fuck?  It's been the biggest top story.  You can't look at one of these news channels on our 12 televisions without seeing this goddamn flu bullshit. 
[01:09:30]  I got a question.  Where's the bird flu?  That just went away?  What happened to the bird flu?  Are people still getting the bird flu?  They have to still be getting the bird flu, right?  No.  That was so 2006, I think.  Yeah.  This is the latest bit of fucking end of the world bullshit.  But they have to be getting the bird flu somewhere.  We didn't just get rid of that type of flu. 
[01:10:00]  No.  No.  Where'd it go?  This is clearly the dominating topic.  In the words of the World Health Organization tonight, humanity is under threat.  Raising the public panic.  Humanity is not under threat.  Arthur Chien.  That is probably one of the most grossly overstated things I've ever heard.  Humanity is under threat.  If a meteor is heading toward Earth, that's a threat to humanity.  This is a cold. 
[01:10:30]  Holy shit.  I can't believe he got away with saying that.  The death count, by the way, they said was 152.  It's seven.  Seven.  Yeah.  They said 152 in Mexico.  I heard 152.  Yeah.  No.  Read the Drudge Report.  They went and said they were mistaken.  It's seven so far.  Well, don't be mistaken.  People will die from this thing.  But once again, people also die from the regular flu.  Yeah.  And Anthony brought this up.  Flues. 
[01:11:00]  And it's true.  This flu, they're saying, is no worse than the regular flu.  Might even be what?  It's milder.  Not as bad?  Yeah.  It's not as bad as just your run-of-the-mill other flu.  Let's hear Arthur Chien really pumping up the fear for everybody.  This is clearly the dominating topic.  In the words of the World Health Organization tonight, humanity is under threat.  Raising the public pandemic level to five, it is the second highest on their threat scale.  That organization says it believes a global outbreak of this disease is imminent. 
[01:11:30]  Imminent.  The fucking way they word this stuff, the way they over-sensationalize, it's astounding anyone watches this shit.  It's enough to make me shake my fist at the TV.  Yes.  Yes.  Put a mic on that TV.  Get a buzz going.  For the boys down the hall, Puddle of Age, Jersey.  Multiple hack radio stations are playing a fake commercial for bad swine flu parodies. 
[01:12:00]  They're terrific.  You must find it.  There's also a parody song based on Right Set Fred that says, I'm too sexy for my mask.  So get the...  Wow, that's topical.  A topical song.  That's good.  And then this...  At least 11 states confirmed cases, and Texas is under a state of emergency after it reported the first death.  A 23-month-old boy who was visiting from Mexico.  We expect to see more cases, more hospitalizations, and unfortunately, we're likely to see additional deaths from the outbreak. 
[01:12:30]  A state of emergency for one death.  Mm-hmm.  You know, I'm not even going to go into detail about this because we're talking about this, but every clip that's been played so far, I've had to turn my headphones way down.  Look how low on the board I got you.  I know.  Look at that.  And then crank it way back up when we talk.  Well, they're also saying the commercials are a lot louder on the channel.  Why do I...  I mean, you know, Steve.  Steve Blatter, there might be a problem with the commercials, too.  The clips are so loud in my headphones that I have to lower my headphones down and then raise them up when we talk again. 
[01:13:00]  I should have to control my headphone volume during the show.  Everything should just be nice.  One nice level.  What is going on?  For the love of Jeebus.  People are tweaking the studio because they think they know what they're doing.  Up here comes Steve down the hall.  Yes, I'm right on it.  Your Rolaids are on their way.  What?  That couch thing was dealing with...  I talked to Steve about the studio being wrecked and that other problem. 
[01:13:30]  Which one?  Your chair.  What?  That wasn't even a problem.  That was almost an afterthought this morning.  I'm like, hey, you know that chair I used to sit in at the other joint?  I really would like to sit in that.  I kind of liked that chair.  It would be nice if it was here.  Can you see if you could get it over here?  Yeah.  That's all.  That's all that was.  I'm on it.  I've got good news and bad news.  What do you want first?  What's the bad news?  I'm still alive. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, shit.  All right.  Some sanity.  He's teasing him for us.  Some sanity.  Jon Stewart had fun with the flu.  Now, as you probably know, the outbreak began south of the border in Mexico, where it  has claimed 149 lives so far, ranking it last on the list of things that can kill you in  Mexico.  Number one, of course, still bullet flu.  Bullet flu.  Bullet flu, of course, an airborne virus in Mexico. 
[01:14:30]  Now, from what I understand, the virus has been mostly contained in Mexico.  Oh, I don't think anything is coming across that border.  Unless it wants to.  You know, it's been out there for a while, especially the younger demos.  They're getting their news from Jon Stewart.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And the reason is, and because these dummy news organizations don't get it, they don't  understand, Jon Stewart gives his viewers honesty with a little humor.  Yeah, it's whatever the news is.  He keeps it in perspective. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, there is a certain perspective you got to put on these things.  You have to.  The news is all about, okay, we could use the swine flu to really pump up our ratings  so it's all about fear.  You hear me?  I mean, you could just visualize these meetings that the main guy has.  We want to scare the fuck out of everybody out there.  Ratings go up.  We could charge more for the commercials.  It's all it is.  They saw this story, ran with it, just knowing, like, this will be something people are going 
[01:15:30]  to watch and turn the news on and find out about the pandemic.  And the worse we make it, the more they're going to tune in to see how many more people  died.  That's what it is, too.  It's a fucking score.  They're keeping a score.  How many people are dead?  Well, I got to get home and turn the news on and see how many people are dead.  They want a dead person in New York City from this swine flu so bad.  Oh, God, the local news is chomping at the bit.  So bad.  They want a dead New Yorker from this. 
[01:16:00]  Anybody sniffling on the streets of New York, they're tripping and trying to push in front  of cabs, anything, anything to get that first death.  Stewart did this.  But I haven't looked at the news for about two hours, so let's just see where we're at.  In the U.S., there have been eight cases.  Kansas, two confirmed cases.  California added another.  Ohio, New York City.  You can add Michigan to the list.  The highly contagious disease may already be in Europe.  France, Spain, Israel, New Zealand.  Canada has now also confirmed six mild cases of the virus. 
[01:16:30]  Uh, I like a good scare as much as the next guy, but for six mild cases of the flu, you're  going to turn four million square miles bright red.  That's what they've been doing.  Yeah, they did.  They put the big red friggin' Canada up there.  Right, like, infected!  Infected!  That's funny.  Unbelievable.  This is the shit they are.  They are such pieces of shit.  Oh, garbage.  That is a big jump. 
[01:17:00]  A few people in your country get the swine flu, so you make the entire country red.  That's a brilliant point.  And that just shows you what the fear thing is all about.  They want the whole globe to be red, so that's what they're doing.  Like, six people in Canada?  Well, Canada's fucked.  Yep.  Boom!  Yep.  Put the whole, uh, place, uh, red.  What does pandemic mean?  Because technically, if one guy in Europe has it, one guy in South America and one guy  in North America, isn't that technically a pandemic?  I don't...  I think so.  I don't know.  It's across a bunch of demics.  Yes.  A lot of demics have been crossed. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, what is a demic?  I don't know.  If it's an aka, they don't listen to this show.  Not to get alarmist, but...  Friday.  What is a perpies out there?  What does that break look like up there?  Just blood coming out of your eyes?  Lava out of your penis?  What's going on?  Seems to me we're in for a good old-fashioned scare-off.  Live and at large at the prep school where the flu epidemic hit New York.  It won't stay in St. Francis Prep.  It's gonna go all the way to Chaminade. 
[01:18:00]  Cardinal Newman.  Don Bosco.  No prep school is safe.  Who's next?  God damn, man.  Is that great?  Yeah.  I mean, there's a million of these clips.  We'll do one more.  There's like 15 we could do today, but this is a good one, too.  Well, you've done it.  I'm freaking out.  Is there anything else you guys want to add?  I don't want to freak out about this. 
[01:18:30]  We don't want to freak anyone out.  We don't want to freak people out with this story, but it is a big story.  Do you even watch your own networks?  You're the only reason we are freaking out.  Perfect.  And that's why people are getting their news from places like Jon Stewart.  That's perfect.  How brilliant is that?  We were fine.  Well, since it's going to kill us all, I think a fair question would be, what is swine flu? 
[01:19:00]  Now, I'm not a doctor anymore.  But it does sound serious.  It's got genetic components from a number of sources, including human, swine, and avian sources.  So a mix of human, pig, and bird sources, there's only two ways for that to happen.  A genetic mutation that crosses all three species, or some idiot turkey club sandwich.  That's good.  Yeah.  This was reported today, too. 
[01:19:30]  Greg in Jersey.  Greg.  Greg.  Good evening.  What's up, guys?  Hey, Greg.  Hey, man.  Hey, that guy who you had on, the reporter right before you put Jon Stewart on, he referred to it as a disease.  ALS is a disease.  This is a freaking flu.  It's a virus.  Yeah, that's very important to tell people.  A disease.  It's not a disease.  It's a virus.  You're absolutely right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Jimmy in Maryland.  Jimmy.  Yeah, what's up, buddy?  Hey, what's going on today?  Hey. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah, when it first came out, you know, a couple of days ago on the news, I saw, they  said it could be a possible bioterrorism.  These people are fucking idiots.  Oh, they love fear-mongering.  It's ridiculous.  And then, thank you, sir.  Trying to get to a bunch of calls because everyone's calling right now.  Tony in San Diego.  Tony.  Good evening.  Tony, what's up?  Was that us or them?  That was me.  Good evening.  Please, every caller.  I love good evening.  What a greeting. 
[01:20:30]  I really thought it was him.  I know.  Please, every caller.  Good evening.  Tony.  Yeah, say, I'm just thinking about all the doctors that have got the co-pays.  All the people that just got the common cold going in, giving $25 or $30.  You know what?  Maybe this is Obama's way to, you know, get the economy moving again.  Get the economy going with a...  Everybody with their co-pays.  A pandemic.  Everybody handing over, what, $20?  Yeah.  That would add up fast.  Their co-pay. 
[01:21:00]  Thank you, sir.  How about, boys?  All right.  Speaking of Obama...  Have a nice night.  Good evening.  Good evening.  We're going to deal with Obama in a little bit, but this from his little press conference  yesterday, Obama monitoring the swine flu.  This is what he had to say last night.  We are continuing to closely monitor the emergency cases of the H1N1 flu virus throughout the United  States.  What?  I guess I said this morning, this is obviously a very serious situation, and every American 
[01:21:30]  should know that their entire government is taking the utmost precautions and preparations.  Yeah.  I've requested an immediate $1.5 billion in emergency funding from Congress to support  our ability to monitor and track this virus and to build our supply of antiviral drugs and  other equipment, and we will also ensure that those materials get to where they need  to be as quickly as possible.  A billion fucking dollars to piggy flu?  Piggy flu.  Idiot.  First of all, H1N1, he should be able to say the word. 
[01:22:00]  You shouldn't have to do that because...  I know.  Let's say hi to Mongo the trucker.  Mongo.  Mongo.  Hi, Mongo.  Good evening.  You think they named this shit up the Chinese calendar?  Next is going to be the cat flu, then the dog flu.  You think they're getting this from the Chinese calendar?  How about the flu? 
[01:22:30]  That's a big crash.  Ow.  He's a trucker.  I kind of liked it.  Bird flu, now swine flu.  I didn't get it.  What do you mean?  He's gone.  Oh.  And then Obama had more on the swine flu.  He's giving everybody prevention tips.  Swine flu prevention tips.  Oh, is he?  Yes.  What do you think he's going to say here?  Oh.  Go to work.  And finally, I've asked every American to take the same steps you would take to prevent  any other flu.  Keep your hands washed. 
[01:23:00]  Cover your mouth when you cough.  Stay home from work if you're sick.  Shut up.  And keep your children home from school if they're sick.  The president had to tell us.  Wash our hands.  Wash your hands.  And not sneeze in someone's face.  We have something here at the White House called the Brown List.  People don't wash their hands.  We'll continue to provide regular updates to the American people as we receive more information.  And everyone should rest assured that this government is prepared to do whatever it takes  to control the impact of this virus. 
[01:23:30]  Whatever it takes.  Yeah.  All right.  Do we have any of the callers?  Is anyone upset about the flow?  Well, let's say hi to Todd in Virginia.  Hi, Todd.  Good evening.  Hey, guys.  Hey, I figured he was going to tell us to wash our hands.  With dollar bills.  Anybody remember the SARS virus?  How that was going to kill the whole world?  That's right.  SARS was giant.  That was just one of those things that was going to take over the world.  I forgot what SARS was.  I forgot about that one. 
[01:24:00]  It was the sneezing Asians.  Yes.  Remember SARS?  Yes.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Actually called SARS.  So I guess they cured that one, too.  Where do these things, where do these potential killers go after the media is done with them?  I don't know.  They just cure them in the media laboratory?  They go to a fucking flu reality show.  I go back to past flus.  SARS got voted off the pandemic. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  Where did it go?  These things aren't cured.  They lose.  People lose interest because they start getting.  They're on to the news.  Once the news keeps saying, oh, my God, this is horrible, horrible, horrible.  And then people realize, wait a minute.  It's not really that horrible.  Then they got to move on to something else.  Killer bees, things like that.  That was huge for a while.  And then people were like, where are the bees?  Are they still killing people?  Oh, yeah.  They're working their way up still.  They're fucking riding little bicycles.  They're fucking lazy. 
[01:25:00]  Well, they are Africanized bees.  Oh, my God.  That's what they are.  That's what the killer bees are.  I'm just saying.  I learned that on Family Guy.  Why don't you go across the hall and say that line and see if they.  Yeah, go ahead.  Go into.  Go ahead.  Yeah, yeah.  They just walked in the studio.  Go ahead.  They're ready to go back on air.  Why don't you have that cute laugh?  I want to buy them during the show.  Get a laugh.  Another caller, I think.  Oh, really?  Well, let's say hi to John in Philly.  Hi, John.  Good evening. 
[01:25:30]  Good evening.  My school actually sent out a mass email about swine flu,  and it was actually just a document telling us how to properly wash our hands.  Really?  No, come on.  Because if we're in college, we have no idea how to wash our hands.  Can you go to school if you have the flu?  No.  My health doesn't allow it.  Ah.  I want to do a radio show with just those clips where I ask questions and he answers everything.  He just answers everything.  He should have been in the movie more. 
[01:26:00]  Ah, he's fantastic.  I heard your wife had the flu.  Can I see her?  No, she's dead.  Oh, sorry to hear that.  So she died of the flu?  Victim of the modern age.  Poor, poor girl.  That is terrible.  Yeah.  I thought she was raped.  She was very badly raped, you see?  You see, and then I guess the guy had the flu that raped her.  That's terrible.  Let's go to Cody in Indiana. 
[01:26:30]  Hi, Cody.  Hey, Ron and Etcetera, noon to three.  Good evening.  Um, I'm a driver and they have now issued a face mask, alcohol wipe.  They are telling us that the people that don't work for our company that come into our office  are not allowed to use the restrooms or the telephones.  And I've been sitting on the phone for about three weeks and I call up today and someone  goes, oh shit, he's got the swine flu.  What a bunch of fucking assholes. 
[01:27:00]  That is a great gag to do now is just to get into a crowd and just go, and just make it  like you're sick.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  I feel, oh, I got to get home.  I got to get home.  Who can play sick very well?  We got to do this in Times Square.  We're a mere block away.  Oh, well, how about, uh, fantastic.  How about you get on the train and you sneeze and you just start going oink, oink, oink,  oink.  That's a giveaway. 
[01:27:30]  Be more funny.  This caused a public panic.  I like the idea of the coughing and sneezing though.  You get a huge fucking, you get a whole subway car to yourself.  You blow a guy in a fucking bunny, bunny mask.  Great party.  By Saturday, only Will Smith will be left in New York.  Yes.  Is it true that swine flu broke out after Obama went to Mexico?  Oh.  Was he down there recently? 
[01:28:00]  Yes.  All right.  All righty.  And we'll go to Steve on Long Island.  Hi, Steve.  Good evening.  Good evening.  Hey, listen, there's only one way to stop this thing.  Find out where it originated from.  All you need to do is get a little bit of E-Rox blood and you make a fucking vaccine out  of it.  Focus.  Ow.  Ugh.  I think I have the swine flu.  I'm feeling the chills.  Hey, Rich Voss is here, by the way.  Oh, where's Voss?  He's way down the hall. 
[01:28:30]  He can make his way to the studio.  Swine flu PSA is from 19...  Where's Voss?  70.  76.  The swine flu has been around.  The swine flu starring Charo.  I don't need another flu shot.  I had a flu shot last year.  A swine flu epidemic may be coming.  Swine flu shot?  Well, I don't know.  I've been thinking about it.  It could make you very sick.  Swine flu?  Man, I'm too fast today to catch me. 
[01:29:00]  You'll want to be protected.  I'm the healthiest 55-year-old you've ever seen.  Hey, I play golf every weekend.  Get a shot of protection.  The swine flu shot.  Wow, that's ominous.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I like the black guy.  Yeah.  You're going to catch me?  Yeah.  I'm too busy with my bitches, motherfucker.  Wearing a pimp hat.  Yeah.  Wearing an old 70s.  How great is that, big platform shoes?  Fucking Huggy Bear saying he's not getting the shot. 
[01:29:30]  I got my motherfucking fur coat on.  I don't eat pork, motherfucker.  I'm Muslim.  You chase me in my Cadillac.  I know.  I smoke a new pot.  What a stereotypical commercial.  That really was.  And our Asian friend,  Oh, me no can't a swine fool.  Me no can shop a swine fool.  Yes.  And our other friends,  Yes, Mr. Bromwood,  It's too expensive. 
[01:30:00]  Why would I pay a dollar  For the swine fool shot?  That is really horribly stereotypical, isn't it?  Of course it is.  Hey, I'm just an old white guy playing golf.  Hey, Mr. Wolkowski,  I think I'll have bacon.  Oh no, our Polish friend.  You shouldn't do that.  It's the swine fool epidemic.  You think it was racist? 
[01:30:30]  Yes, it was.  Very stereotypical.  Oh, I think I'll just drink and throw up all over myself.  Well, Mr. Ross,  You should get a shot for the swine fool.  Let's say hi to Adam in Jersey.  Adam.  Good evening.  Hi, Adam.  Hi, Adam.  I work at an ER.  And last night,  Everybody's freaking out, right,  Over this stupid flu.  So, me and a buddy of mine, 
[01:31:00]  We walk in hacking and coughing and sneezing on everybody in the waiting room.  Everybody's flipping out, yelling, cursing at us.  Everything.  Freaking out because they're all afraid that we got the flu.  Yeah, people get angry at that.  Look, who doesn't enjoy a day off from work?  Going to work.  A lot of people driving in right now,  Going to work and just start fake sneezing.  Yeah.  They will tell you to go home so quickly today,  And they're not going to dock you a vacation day.  If you're good at sneezing,  Maybe even a little makeup,  Some red around your eyes and nose, 
[01:31:30]  And just be like,  I woke up this morning.  It's just a cold.  I don't think it's the flu or anything,  So don't worry about it.  Yeah, don't overplay it.  Don't say it like it's a flu.  People are just like,  I don't know.  I can make it.  I think it's allergies.  I can make it.  I think it's allergies.  It's hay fever or something,  But my throat is really,  And I'm all phlegmy in my lungs.  If you're allergic to cats,  Just find a cat and rub it across your eyes  Before you go to work to really work.  I think it's allergies, 
[01:32:00]  But I'm not really sure.  I'll talk a clarin,  And we'll see what happens.  No, I think you should overplay it.  You should walk right in and go,  I better go home, boss.  I think I've got the swine flu.  And I feel sneezes coming.  Just be a real idiot.  Get to your desk and shut up.  You want to hear another swine flu PSA from 1976?  Yay!  Proving that this thing's been around,  Will be around,  Long past the media hyping the shit out of it.  Yeah, let's hear. 
[01:32:30]  Joe brought it home from the office.  He gave it to Betty,  And one of his kids.  And to Betty's mother.  But Betty's mother went back to California the next day.  Oh my god.  On her way to the airport,  Is that a black boyfriend?  He gave it to a cab driver,  A ticket agent,  And one of the charming stewardesses.  At school,  Joe's kid gave it to some other kids.  And Mrs. Merrill got it,  And gave it to her husband.  In California,  Betty's mother gave it to her best friend, 
[01:33:00]  Dottie.  But Dottie had a heart condition,  And she died.  No!  She did!  Dottie gave it to her girlfriend,  The mailman,  The mailman,  The paper boy,  And the vet when she went to pick up her chihuahua.  If a swine flu epidemic comes,  This is how it could spread.  You'll want to be protected,  Especially if you're elderly or chronically ill.  Get a shot of protection.  The swine flu shot.  So there's a thing for it already? 
[01:33:30]  The swine flu shot?  Well, this is a different strain.  Than that swine flu?  Yeah, it kind of mutates over the years.  But I do believe they are isolating  Some of the fucking happy horse shit in the flu  In order to make the vaccine.  And they said it should be by early May.  Which is like,  Wait a minute.  Isn't it early May?  Just about Saturday, right?  It's very important to get tested for the swine flu. 
[01:34:00]  Oh, hi Ted.  Hi, good morning Gregory.  What do you got on the swine flu today?  Well, I have my own business.  Ted Sheckler's swine flu tests the emporium.  Really?  Yes.  What's that about?  Well, you come down  And you sneeze and cough in my face repeatedly.  And then if I'm alive in a week,  You'll know you're okay.  Well, that doesn't sound too safe for you, my friend.  Well, you know, I'm just trying to help the public good.  The test is $40,000.  $40,000? 
[01:34:30]  It certainly is, Gregory.  Putting his skin on the line here.  I certainly am.  Stop staring at me, Richard.  $40,000.  Yes.  A lot of people want to know if they have the swine flu, Ted.  Well, I also do the AIDS test too.  That's a rough one.  I'll take at least three fluid houses of semen to my backside.  And then I walk for a long time.  And if I fall over and just can't get back up,  You better check yourself in somewhere. 
[01:35:00]  Give it two years.  Two years.  Two years.  Have you had any customers yet?  Yes, I've had three.  But no one has paid me yet.  Some man just fucks my bottom a lot.  And then coughed on me.  Oh, who is this tall, svelte, young man?  Oh.  Yeah, good one, Ted.  Oh, boy.  Hey, Rich.  How are you, buddy?  Not bad.  I'm pretty good. 
[01:35:30]  I just...  Watching him do that character is amazing.  What character?  That was Ted, and he's down the hall now.  Well, that's what I mean.  When Ted came in.  Oh, right.  Okay.  Theodore!  I prefer my given name.  I hate Ted.  It's too short.  Sounds insignificant.  I'm just waiting.  Probably another week, the Jews are going to get blamed for the swine flu.  I'm just waiting for that to happen.  Oh, yeah.  It's our fault, right?  Didn't our doctors inject people with it?  No, the Mexicans are really being blamed for it. 
[01:36:00]  That's right.  The Mexicans are really being blamed.  They have Patient Zero.  How do you find Patient Zero?  Patient Zero.  I know how to find Producer Zero.  I'll tell you what.  Yes.  The militia groups have a new agenda at their meetings now.  Yeah.  There's definitely going to be some fences going up now.  A few fences.  Yeah, they found Patient Zero.  I don't know how they do that.  They just keep chasing back.  Hey, who'd you come in contact with?  Right.  Hey, who'd you see? 
[01:36:30]  And then it was some little kid.  He must have been playing with the piggies.  You think the kid now has to admit that he was fucking the pig up the ass?  He must have been doing something.  Jesus, if I got the flu for every pig I fucked.  I bet you'd have it often.  You know, Obama wants the whole world to get along.  That's his agenda, right?  Yeah.  And then the swine flu hits, and then you see how different countries are handling this situation,  and you realize we are never going to get along with the rest of the world. 
[01:37:00]  No.  Egypt has decided they need to kill every single pig in their country.  Yeah.  That is the angle they're taking on this.  But don't they understand you don't get it really from pigs?  It's one of those weird...  They don't care.  They don't understand.  They don't know.  What do they know?  Yeah.  What do they know?  They build triangles.  They should start calling it Arab flu if that's what's going to happen.  Killing, you know.  You know what I mean?  Okay, Sean, one for two.  I knew exactly what you meant. 
[01:37:30]  If I stopped now, one for two, that's 500.  I'm in the Hall of Fame for 500.  But they're killing all their pigs.  Yeah.  People are sad.  They don't want to see the pigs.  Do they even dig on swine?  I don't know.  I don't think so.  All right.  We're going to get more info.  You want a charming motherfucking pig.  Like that Arnold from Green Acres.  We're going to get more info on the swine flu from Jim in South Dakota.  Jim?  Good evening.  Hi, Jim.  Hello.  The reason everybody's so worried about the swine flu is the last outbreak. 
[01:38:00]  What?  You're reporting like 50 minutes.  His phone has swine flu.  He could have the oldest phone in the United States.  Jim?  Yeah.  All right.  What were you saying?  I was saying in 1918, the last swine flu outbreak killed 50 million people.  That's why there's a word about it.  That's 1918.  I didn't have shit back then. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  The cold killed a couple million.  The consumption got you.  Right.  Oh, my God.  He's got the consumption.  I got the vapors.  Look.  You know what?  We're all secretly hoping that this becomes a big thing and a lot of people die.  We just don't want to be one of the people that die.  That's exactly how human nature is.  That's why we watch CNN.  You want to see those numbers going up.  Like, oh, wow.  Wow.  Cool.  This is a biggie.  Right?  Yeah.  We all secretly hope for the death and destruction as long as it's not us or anyone we know. 
[01:39:00]  That's what people love.  Yeah.  Because whenever a tragedy happens, you're going, oh, big deal.  Let me see some fucking numbers.  You know?  And if they all start dying, I'll have an excuse why people aren't showing up to the clubs.  Sorry.  Just looking at the Jets cheerleaders.  They are pretty fucking hot.  People aren't coming to the clubs because no one's buying tickets.  What's that?  It's just hard now with the economy and shit.  It's hard for people to get people just to come out for it.  I haven't had trouble.  I mean, I just saw people have.  Well, let me tell you this.  I'm going to make this announcement on the air. 
[01:39:30]  I am not showing up in Kansas City next week.  So if any XM or Open Anthony listeners.  Because the fucking scumbag club that I got in a fight.  Last time I was there, I helped the owner.  I got in a fight.  I fought for this owner.  I was supposed to get, next week, $3,500 plus travel.  And now the owner's doing some fucking movie or something.  And his heroin addict brother calls me and goes.  Well, we don't know if the guy's on heroin.  Exactly, Rich.  What are you talking about?  He's been in and out of jail for it. 
[01:40:00]  I'm not fucking.  Well, I don't know.  Okay, so here's the thing.  That's what you're saying.  Okay, you're right.  So you say now.  Okay, so you're right.  Rich Voss is saying this.  I shouldn't say that.  No, you can say it, but you got to like protect yourself and everybody else around you.  Oh, really?  That's why.  You can't just say like someone's on heroin.  You can't say that shit.  But I didn't say your name.  Doesn't matter.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Okay, so his scumbag brother.  It's been alleged.  All right.  You don't like the brother.  That's fair.  You can say you don't like somebody.  How about that? 
[01:40:30]  Yeah, he's a guy you don't care for.  That's a big deal, Rich.  You got to be careful.  Oh, okay.  It's $3,500 plus travel.  Also, he calls me three weeks before and goes, I'm only giving you $2,000 plus travel.  Times are tough.  I go, so I go, okay, no problem.  You know, what the hell?  What can I do?  So I'll see you then.  Well, guess what?  If you're XM listeners, I won't be there next week.  And maybe I'll call him and tell him I'm not coming.  You backed out.  I didn't back out.  I'm not showing up.  I don't blame you, dude.  It's amazing.  I don't blame you.  I have these clubs.  They're fucking just scumbags. 
[01:41:00]  They really are.  Everyone's got an excuse now.  Who's your agent?  Poverty.  Sorry.  Who's my agent?  You're fucking, yeah.  How did your agent not attack for that?  Because my agent is Ira Velas.  Me.  And coming up on the show, Bill Burr will be here in a little while.  And the Iron Sheik.  Iron Sheik World Wrestling Federation Chumplin.  Right.  Chumplin.  We can't wait to talk to the Chumplin.  I have to clear something up, too, about a comedy club. 
[01:41:30]  You're at Comics, right?  Yeah, I'm at Comics this weekend.  Uh-oh.  You've got to clear this up?  No, nothing terrible.  Yesterday, I opened on the air, which I appreciate you doing that, man, because there was a,  I was going to do a guest spot tonight on a show they do, but unannounced.  It was just like, oh, do a spot.  It's New York or The Cellar or whatever.  But I wouldn't announce it because it's not a headline show.  Right.  And they were, you know, it was known that I was not going to be promoted or any of that  stuff.  It was just to do a $50 spot or whatever.  Yeah.  And then they sent out an email blast saying, uh, you're a favorite comedian from the Opie 
[01:42:00]  and Anthony show, uh, from Lucky Louie and not Louie.  Like, they did all these things.  It was absolutely me.  They said the other guy, which is-  Yeah, it was so-  It's kind of insulting, to be honest with you.  Yeah, I don't know who it is.  Losing weight rapidly, stuff like that.  They made it, it was a direct plug saying, yeah, I was going to be there.  Um, again, not that the whole world's going to give a shit, but you know, whatever.  They said they wouldn't.  So I went down this, uh, the line.  It was actually a mix-up.  There was nothing done purposefully.  It was just, it was an honest mistake where, uh, I, we, we, we inquired enough and, uh, 
[01:42:30]  they didn't do it to be malicious.  And they actually, we'll send out a retraction email.  I'm like, yeah.  No, I-  Retraction email.  Yeah, they were sincere.  It's obvious they were trying to be cool with it.  Yeah, yeah, they were, it was not exactly what, they didn't intend to be deceitful,  so I won't be there, but.  Well, if you'd like to do a guest spot Friday and Saturday on my show at Comics, I won't  announce it right now.  Why don't we take yours as a show, I would do a spot on.  How about we break? 
[01:43:00]  I'm just holding my dick.  Jesus.  I don't know what happened.  No, we're going to take a break.  I want to clear it up.  No kidding.  Because, uh.  Can I hold your dick?  Yeah.  You want to hear, you want to hear, uh, Kenny's rap song?  No.  Uh, the Dr. Kaku?  Let's do the Dr. Kaku one more time.  Dr. Kaku.  By the way, uh, Kenny recorded a demo for the classic disco station here at Sirius XM.  Oh, he wants a gig there?  Yeah, so he actually recorded a little something.  We might do that after the break. 
[01:43:30]  All right?  When he pulled my truck around, uh, the disco station was on.  Oh, for real?  That's a real thing.  Yeah, he was listening to it.  He was in the morning to get some knowledge and some disco on the way home.  He's like, here's some disco for your drive home.  I was like, thanks.  Click the second I got.  Like, the door shut and the station changed instantly.  Up.  Three, two, one.  This is theoretical physicist Dr. Michio Kaku.  And you are, what are you are?  Uh, Henry C. Matt, professor of theoretical physics is the official title.  This is Opie and Anthony. 
[01:44:00]  And this is Dr. Kaku on the Opie and Anthony show.  What is antimatter?  100% efficiency.  Now, a hydrogen bomb is 1% efficient.  I know because my friends work on this thing.  My friends drink.  What about, um, cell phones?  What are they going to become?  Many futurists believe that the future will look like a Disney movie.  Uh, for example, uh, the magic mirror.  You go up to it and say, mirror, mirror on the wall, and it answers any question you want.  That's how he has to talk to us. 
[01:44:30]  That's what we're, that's what we're joking about.  Do you believe in ghosts?  Many people believe that ghosts lived in a higher dimension.  If you are looking down on a tabletop, and there are two-dimensional people living on  the tabletop like Cookie, Cookie Man, you would have the power of a ghost.  He's got to use the term.  I love Cookie Man.  Cookie Man took Cookie Man.  Any questions?  How dumb do you think we really are?  Let's go back to high school.  If this was a lunch table, would you sit with us?  I think twice.  This is theoretical physicist Michio Kaku, and even I can't explain how bad this show 
[01:45:00]  is.  I first dropped acid when I was 18.  I was over at these people's house one night.  This guy I went to school with was over there and asked me if I wanted to try some acid.  I had read about it in the newspapers and heard a few friends talk about it, so I was curious.  I was pretty jacked up on marijuana, so I decided to try it, and I dropped it. 
[01:45:30]  I don't know what I was waiting for, or a flash, or a rush, or whatever, but I kept sitting  there waiting and waiting, and nothing was happening.  So I got up and then went to the dresser and put on a pair of pink capris and a green and brown blouse.  I thought the colors were beautiful, so we tripped down to Market Street, and I decided to buy a hot dog.  I was very hungry, and I had put mustard and ketchup and relish in the usual, and I put the hot dog up to my mouth, and somebody started screaming. 
[01:46:00]  I didn't know what was happening, so I looked up at my friend Terry and said,  Did you hear that?  Didn't you hear someone scream?  He said, No.  I got the hot dog up to my mouth again, and I was ready to bite, and the scream got louder. 
[01:46:30]  And it hit me. No, it couldn't be.  And I looked down at the hot dog, and there was a face on him.  Eyes, nose, a mouth.  I had put the ketchup to where it looked like his hair.  And he started telling me that I couldn't eat him.  And he had a wife and seven kids at home to support. 
[01:47:00]  And I stood there with this hot dog and asked Terry,  Do you know this hot dog is talking to me?  And he says, Nah, let's get out of here.  He thought I was just faking.  And I told him, Look at the thing. He's got a face.  And he's screaming.  And the guy finally looked over, and he got on the same trip that I was on.  And we sat there carrying on a conversation with that hot dog.  Finally, I decided I was just hallucinating,  so I put it in my mouth and bit down. 
[01:47:30]  It screamed so loud that you could hear it all over town.  So I had to throw it on the ground and step on it.  And I was jumping on this hot dog in the middle of Market Street.  I realized that I had murdered it. 
[01:48:00]  And I took off screaming down the street, scared.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Hola.  Got Rich Voss in studio playing comics.  May 1st and 2nd.  What's that?  Friday and Saturday there, Rich?  Is it only Friday and Saturday? 
[01:48:30]  Okay.  And Bonnie's on the show, too.  Very cool.  Very funny.  Bonnie McFarland.  God, is she killing?  She is great.  Because we've got a bad reputation on the show that we hate female comics,  and it's just not true.  I like that Amy, too.  Amy Schumer is very funny.  Amy Schumer I like, too.  It is kind of true, though.  Janine Garofalo, not so much.  Go read Barney's.  Barney.  Barney.  Barney.  You secretly wish you were married to a Barney, right?  No, he's just mentioning his favorite TV show.  I know.  Go read her article, Barney's article on Women Aren't Funny on, I think, Shaggy. 
[01:49:00]  Women Aren't Funny?  Yeah, she wrote this brilliant article.  I have it here.  It's unbelievable how well she writes and how bad she picks men.  I want to read this.  I don't even know if this went out.  This is the retraction email that comics sent out or was going to send out, and it's harmless.  It's just that they're just going, hey, it was a screw up.  But Kenny is so negative, he's like, they blamed you.  I'm like, they're not blaming me. 
[01:49:30]  Yes, they did.  But they're really not.  This was the idea.  This guy, Brian, I like this guy.  Here's what they wrote.  Comedy is a fickle mistress.  Lineups are always subject to change, and we just want everyone to know that tomorrow's  show at Comics will not include Jim Norton.  That doesn't mean Shtickpedia isn't awesome.  It is, and here's the lineup.  And then at the end, he said, I want it to end with, we think that's the lineup, but who  knows?  Maybe we'll all be dead.  But he was voted down.  They wouldn't let him put that.  Yeah, it was funny.  But that's the whole email.  It's just harmless.  Yeah.  But Kenny thinks it's blaming me by saying comedy is a fickle mistress. 
[01:50:00]  No, it's not.  It sounded like Kenny thought they were saying you're fickle.  Right.  Or comedians are a fickle mistress is one thing.  But that's just going, hey, you know how the business is.  These things happen.  That's all that is.  No, I think that it could have been worded better in your favor.  But it wasn't worded against me.  No, but it's like naming you that people could reasonably allude that it was your fault that  you're not appearing. 
[01:50:30]  No, they couldn't because they're saying comedy is a fickle mistress.  That's a nice way of blaming you.  No, but because they would have said comedians are fickle.  No, comedy is a fickle mistress is kind of like the whole industry, the whole thing.  The way things are run, the idea of a show, of booking a show.  Yes.  I have reading comprehension, too, that it's not blaming.  Believe me, I've been blamed for things before.  Pregnancy, harpies.  I understand what blame emails are about.  Put the big one out there.  We all know.  No one's ever blamed me for that. 
[01:51:00]  It's always on a daisy chain.  They'll stick it in someone's ass.  You've never lived long enough.  The retraction should be simple, direct, and to the point.  Not like...  This is simple, direct, and to the point.  No.  Like Kenny, simple, direct, and to the point.  You want to hear my two cents when I wrote what it should be?  Yeah.  Oops, we made a mistake, meaning comics should take the blame.  They made the mistake.  That's stupid.  Who can't because it was a...  Because we don't know exactly who made the mistake. 
[01:51:30]  They don't know if they made the mistake or if it was a translation in an email that they got from somebody else.  So why would they fucking lie?  They don't...  I talked to them, and I don't think they did anything wrong.  I think it was just a mix-up that nobody was technically at fault, and there was no deception.  So, eh, comedy is a fickle mistress.  It's simple.  Lineups are always subject to change.  That's all it was.  They're just letting people know that they're not trying to say that someone's going to be there who isn't.  You should mess everyone up and just show up anyway tonight.  Now show up. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, and really go, what the fuck?  I didn't fuck everything up.  She's a lot of drama over a guest spot.  They didn't make it clear that it wasn't your fault.  Of course it's clear.  It's completely clear.  It's fine.  It's good.  Thank you, Kenny.  How is that not clear?  Yeah, and Voss will be there Friday and Saturday.  Definitely.  Yes.  We don't want Voss to suffer in this.  No.  Is that not clear to you?  Yeah, it's very clear.  That's fine.  Yeah.  Let's move on.  Very clear.  Let's get Bill Burr in here as well.  Billy, billy, billy. 
[01:52:30]  Over our vacation, E-Rock had a Rich Voss story.  Really?  E-Rock's got...  Boy, it's got to be interesting.  Well, there's a very...  Every story E-Rock tells is just so compelling and fascinating to listen to.  There's a very famous person that loves Rich Voss, and you're his favorite comedian.  Do you know who it is?  No fucking way.  Absolutely.  Who?  Anybody want to guess?  Very famous?  You can narrow it down to what kind of fame. 
[01:53:00]  Let's start with that.  Oh, it's going to be...  All right.  This is...  Good idea.  Gary Glitter.  This person's not in the rock world.  Too bad it's not Mark Chapman.  And he's not a kid toucher.  He's not a serial killer or assassin.  So there's no cast and van involved.  Narrowing it down.  He's not a musician.  Not a musician.  An actor.  Not an actor.  Oh, shit.  Not a movie producer.  Not an executive.  Famous.  An athlete. 
[01:53:30]  He's an athlete.  Oh, shit.  Tiger Woods?  No.  He's not a golfer.  Look what I'd do for you guys.  Okay, so he's...  Narrowing it down.  Narrowing it down.  Okay, he's white.  He is white.  See what I'd do?  Yeah, that's what I'm trying to figure.  Now all of a sudden, we're down to an athlete who's white.  Keep going.  Let's go.  This is fun.  You know he's not good.  He's famous.  He's got to be good if he's famous.  Keep going.  Let's go.  Let's narrow this down.  It's not P. Rose.  No, although people with the haircut tend to relate to you.  He is in baseball. 
[01:54:00]  Ah.  So we got baseball.  Baseball.  White.  White.  Retired or playing?  You ask me.  I just asked.  Is he retired or playing?  No, I mean...  I mean, you're right, but say either one.  He's retired.  He's retired.  You're right.  You're right.  Oh, okay.  Retired, white, baseball player.  You're his favorite comedian.  Was he American or National League?  Ooh.  Uh.  Good question.  Sure.  Sure.  Oh, fucking Cal Ripken.  No, it's not Cal Ripken. 
[01:54:30]  Well, why couldn't it be Cal Ripken?  Why would you say no?  You're reaching a little too high.  Oh.  Oh, shit.  Not really, actually.  He's Jewish.  Sandy Koufax.  Yes.  Wow.  Get the fuck out of here.  Yes.  No way.  E-Rock?  Yeah.  How do you know this?  He golfs with my dad regularly, and he's been to several of your shows down in Palm Beach.  And you didn't even know it.  He loves you.  Wow.  That's crazy, because I never worked Palm Beach.  No. 
[01:55:00]  Sandy Koufax, when I was in West Palm?  West Palm, somewhere down in that area.  Yeah.  Why wouldn't he come up to me?  I would have played guy.  He doesn't do that.  Because he's Sandy Koufax.  What's he going to say?  Hi, I'm Sandy Koufax, and you're a nobody who I enjoy?  I'm in the Hall of Flame.  In the Hall of Flame.  The Hall of Flame.  Now you're mixing up your career.  Wow.  So he.  That's pretty cool, man. 
[01:55:30]  Why don't you write him?  Hey, Jew, how about a ball from Voss?  Huh?  That's pretty fucking cool.  That's cool.  What else you got on that, E-Rock?  Does he like me?  He doesn't know of you yet.  Oh, wow.  We told him, but he doesn't know Jimmy yet.  That doesn't happen.  Wait, you met Sandy Koufax?  Yeah.  So why don't you set up a golf date with Voss?  Well, that was the other part.  For Voss.  What's that?  Both him and my dad invited you down to their course to play with them whenever you're down in Florida.  Yeah.  Fuck.  I got to just get rebooked at the improv again. 
[01:56:00]  Cool.  Do you have a, did you get a ball signed?  No.  Yeah.  You can't just take a trip.  Got to get a gig.  Yeah.  Why don't you just take an $80 flight down there?  I didn't even know that was you here.  Oh, my God.  You okay, Jimmy?  Well, I probably would do something like that.  That's my flip.  But I'm doing that, and I'm doing that in August.  I'm taking a trip to play in a golf tournament.  Sandy Koufax, dude.  Sandy Koufax, dude.  You got to go.  What's wrong with you?  That's a good point, right?  Book a flight today.  When I said to E-Rog, did you get a ball sign?  He was like, no.  Like, why would I?  Sandy Koufax.  Because it's a private club. 
[01:56:30]  That was the second time I met the guy.  Bushwood.  No autographs at Bushwood, sir.  The second time?  That would have been my second ball sign.  Oh, yeah.  You know what?  Signed this hat and glove, too, old man.  It's just like, take you in the ball bag.  Fucking, I'll grab your scrotum and run out of the room while you sit there telling stories  about how you struck out a black man.  No one gives a shit.  You're boring everyone at the club.  Oh, it was 2-0.  Shut up.  When they discuss pitch count.  I'm not a fan of the pitch count. 
[01:57:00]  Nobody cares.  First game, played under their lights.  You're fucking boring.  Talk about how you blew a load with Ty Cobb on some chick.  You know, you played 60 years apart.  I was going to say.  Wait a minute.  Tell me how the Georgia peach fucked you in the face.  Don't blow up Rich's spot.  He's this close to playing golf with Sandy Koufax.  If you don't tell him, he thinks Sandy Koufax is a girl.  He's stupid.  Did it hurt you pitching with a glass eye? 
[01:57:30]  Why did you play Peter Pan?  Do you really like wheat fins?  See, I kind of know my history.  That's why I quit gambling and luck.  I will book a flight.  I will go down there and I will play.  And for some reason, oh, it's not you.  That's to be the greatest story ever.  You could play on this guy.  Yeah, you could play on like a Tuesday and not even miss a gig.  You play on New Year's Eve and not miss a gig. 
[01:58:00]  I would like a retraction.  Big story here in New York, a building completely collapsed in lower Manhattan.  It had swine flooring.  Oh, no.  No one was in it.  It looks like it was like one of these construction things.  I don't even know if it was.  It sounds like it was just a really old building that no one was living in anymore.  So there might be a few vagrants.  Oh, my God.  But they got dogs down there trying to figure it out.  But the whole thing collapsed. 
[01:58:30]  Eric Nagel was interviewed because he was allegedly on the top floor doing jumping jacks.  Hey, this is people that are comparing you with Sandy.  Koufax, yes.  Booger Couch, Arkansas.  Hey, guys.  Hi.  Hey, Sandy Koufax, famous for his fastball.  Rich Voss, famous for doing eight balls.  Oh, spitball might have worked.  Good evening.  Spitball would have been good, right?  Yeah, I think spitball might have worked on that one.  You're right. 
[01:59:00]  You had a chance to use the word spitball.  Yeah.  You went with eight ball.  That's really cool, though.  I actually would be happy about that.  That's solid, right?  Yeah.  Bill Burr, you all right?  No swine flu yet?  No, I'm fine.  I was actually looking all that stuff up about what classifies something as an epidemic,  and it basically means more cases than expected.  That's it?  Yeah.  So five people had...  Look at the map, though.  I'm literally quoting Wikipedia right now, so none of this means anything.  Right.  But literally, there are examples of five people had rabies.  That would be considered an epidemic.  Really? 
[01:59:30]  Because it's more people than you'd expect to have rabies.  Jon Stewart had a brilliant twist on this, because they're showing the world map now,  and Canada had like, what was it?  Six mild cases.  Six mild cases.  So they made the entire country of Canada red.  Of course.  Which makes it way worse, right?  Yeah.  Like, oh, my God.  It's like, well, Canada's covered.  Now let's try to make the whole globe red, hopefully, by having one case in every country.  And then the whole globe will be, oh, we're infected.  Hey, you know what's great? 
[02:00:00]  Maybe a bunch of people will kill themselves just out of panic.  Yeah.  Just to, like, freak out.  They're freaking out.  Like I said, I'm all for a big epidemic.  I'm not going to go like this.  You want a pandemic.  I'm fine.  You want a pandemic.  I want a pandemic.  I want a, yeah.  If we have to die, you've got to have some people from other countries die.  Burn out the brush.  Pandemic.  Right.  They're talking about this like it's just, it's wiping out the world.  Like it's the bubonic plague or something.  And I like how it's air, you can catch it, like, airborne and people wearing masks.  Somehow the air gets through.  Yeah, they breathe.  The pig virus doesn't. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, it's amazing.  It doesn't get through.  Those fucking masks are ridiculous.  You'll look like an idiot.  You'll just be coughing in it.  Go on, people.  Every time an Asian person walks by with one of those masks, I just say good.  Because they were wearing those before this swine blue.  They had them since SARS.  Yeah.  Yes, yes.  The SARS mask.  It's their SARS mask.  We all remember the SARS mask.  The multitask.  Yeah.  What, sweetie?  Okay.  It's just every disease is coming out of every other fucking country. 
[02:01:00]  And yet our borders are basically open.  Every disease.  There's, you know, in every other country, fucking animals.  Instead of eating them.  And they bring the shit over here.  And our, what?  Nothing.  Are you ready to go point?  I mean, no.  It's just, no.  You just, you know, I love when you go international.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  It's just, and they don't care about the-  Rich is going with these fucking animals.  Well, you know what I'm saying.  Are you saying that AIDS probably started with someone fucking a monkey? 
[02:01:30]  Exactly.  What?  This is job site thought.  No, or maybe-  Stand around the Roche Coast.  Let me tell you, these fucking pig fuckers.  You should just get them all the fuck out of here.  Dude, if I was Obama, I'd just fucking nuke them.  Here's the thing.  You basically said, I want an epidemic and people to die.  Okay?  In a different way.  I don't like traffic, Rich.  I'm sick of it.  I'm sick of fucking, I earned the right at two in the afternoon to go to a matinee show  of a-  What happened?  Oh, fuck.  Come on, Jimmy. 
[02:02:00]  Okay, maybe they didn't fuck a monkey.  They ate a monkey.  Whatever.  What I'm just saying is-  Went down on it.  What I'm saying is secure the borders.  That's all.  Yeah.  It's so easy to get into this fucking country.  I could use one of those-  There's a reason why it's so easy to get into this country, though.  That's right.  If we didn't want people in this country, we would stop it.  We could use a pig mask, like roll them up and jam in my ears when Rich talks.  Jesus.  Yeah, we want them in here because they vote that way. 
[02:02:30]  No, they're doing the jobs no one wants to do.  He's got the numbskull flu.  First of all, that's bullshit.  They're doing the jobs no one wants to do.  No, because those jobs-  How do you save money on health insurance?  You don't think those jobs were being done before they were all coming here?  They had it.  All of a sudden, Americans said, we're not working anymore.  So you're trying to say that America can't figure out how to keep people from coming here  illegally?  I'm just saying that these are all arguments. 
[02:03:00]  No, I know, but-  In the year 2009, we can't figure out how to keep people from coming here illegally.  We don't want to.  Are you kidding me?  We still want them to.  It's the same as we could-  When we decide we don't want them to, guess what?  We'll shut it down by fucking the 4th of July.  It's the same with the drug trade.  If they wanted to stop it, they would stop it.  It's all bullshit how they spin this stuff in the news.  Yeah, of course.  This is old fucking shit.  It's like the whole thing, you know, borders.  And they're taking jobs away from the people that-  But you know, these are jobs that people wouldn't normally want. 
[02:03:30]  I've heard this for fucking years.  There's no way to secure the borders because Americans are still traveling and they'll pick  it up elsewhere.  Wow, Jim C.  What are some of the symptoms, Jim C., of the swine flu?  Sam, will you stop coming in to work with a mask?  It's giving me the willies.  The willies.  Some of the symptoms are you lie on your side and your ass is flat in a bikini. 
[02:04:00]  You wear a members-only jacket and you do everyone else's job except your own.  Oh, wait, that's me and my girl.  Exactly.  I love tossing Jim the softball.  What are those symptoms?  Hey, Quince, I was fucking a hooker.  Detective Monty!  Now the music gets all wacky.  Yeah.  This isn't when he's cutting into some body. 
[02:04:30]  This is the fun scenes, like where Quincy runs out of the grammar school with his pants  around his ankles and a hard-on and a crying kid running.  Clear stuff running down his leg.  Yeah.  Or Sam fucking beating an animal to death and ripping his hide off while it still breathes,  even though I said beating it to death.  He's not good enough to improv.  He said write this down, Sam.  God damn it. 
[02:05:00]  Jim C.  You want to see how other radio shows are handling the swine flow?  I'd love to because it's a pandemic.  Don't act like you're not impressed.  I'm so nervous.  There was patient zero, ate lunch in a poop lagoon and got the swine flu. 
[02:05:30]  But when he went to his school, he rubbed snot on all their desks and chairs.  He said that it was from when they wouldn't touch his wiener swine.  You know he's going to do the whole song, too. 
[02:06:00]  Then there was this one Jew.  Didn't want to call the virus the swine flu.  But they named it after the country of Mexico.  Mexico didn't work.  The Mexicans don't like it.  It's very disappointing. 
[02:06:30]  A little early.  I'm really going to bring it home now.  What is this?  And then the self-deprecation doesn't help.  You're seriously trying to do this.  And he's like, oh, I'm going to really bring it home now.  And then he does it.  And then he tries to bring it on.  Then he tries to bring it home.  Why don't you just leave it there? 
[02:07:00]  Maybe we can get some info.  Mike in New York.  Rich, you're an idiot.  Illegal aliens don't come here to vote.  They don't?  Well, they do get to vote.  They do.  How?  Don't you have to be a citizen?  I didn't get the whole story, but they get to vote.  There's tricks.  Part of the case.  But that's why they come here?  So they can vote?  No, but once they get here, they're going to vote.  Because they're going to try to keep the politicians in office that are going to keep them here and not get rid of them. 
[02:07:30]  How do they vote?  What do you mean, how do they vote?  How do they vote?  You can't just walk into a voting booth and go.  You've got to register, which means you need certain pieces of paperwork.  There was scams going on.  I don't have the complete story.  You don't have a complete brain.  I don't really want to speak on this, but it happened.  Can you have him in the lobby have a debate?  It happened.  We're a show that no one should be asked a follow-up question ever.  You brought it up with Robert Kelly the other day, but I think it's all of us. 
[02:08:00]  You know what, dude?  A follow-up question just kills all of us.  Dude, they come here.  They're taking our jobs, dude.  They wind up voting and doing a whole bunch of things, dude.  How do they vote?  Because they're burned.  You know, what was that group that they were complaining about that was going out and getting voter registrations? 
[02:08:30]  Oh, my God.  I hear this story because it was a while ago.  This is better than going to the zoo.  You're like, this is amazing.  This was a while ago.  I forget the group.  Just stare at them.  Yeah, go ahead.  You can do it.  They were getting, they were, uh, in, uh.  Wow.  I don't want to sound stupid.  This reminds me of working back in the warehouse.  You don't want to sound stupid.  Way too fucking late.  This is like loading dock conversation right now.  In Chicago.  You don't want to sound stupid.  Cut your tongue out.  In Chicago. 
[02:09:00]  In Chicago.  Yeah.  Good.  A group in Chicago.  Well, not the group.  They're famous.  You know, they, you know.  The Beatles.  Not the Beatles.  The Spinners.  Famous group.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  The Bay City Rollers.  It's like it's a.  Yeah, it's Woody was.  The Motor City Madman.  It's like a liberal group that, you know, works to get.  Oh, the Chicago City Liberals.  To get, to get a.  Second City.  Acorn.  Acorn.  Acorn.  Right.  Okay.  And I don't know the whole story and I don't want to sound like I don't.  But they hang out on the bottom of your foot. 
[02:09:30]  Acorn.  You know what I'm saying.  We don't.  No.  You can't.  You can't get out of it by saying you know what I'm saying.  What I'm saying is.  I will not allow that.  They.  They were getting a lot of illegal voters to register this year.  Supposedly.  I heard.  Allegedly.  Now.  Where did you hear that, Rich?  At one of the meetings.  I heard certain people were voting like trying to vote twice.  And they were registering people that weren't. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  But like homeless people.  Yeah.  But not illegal aliens.  If they're registering homeless people or whatever, what's going to stop them from doing  illegal aliens?  You know, that's a decent point you just made there.  You did make a valid point.  Thank you.  Hold on.  Let me put my glasses on for that one.  Jesus.  Oh, you should raise the point that maybe even if they can't vote, the illegals are somehow  affecting policy here because of the amount of protests that were brought out because  they have so many family members here. 
[02:10:30]  So if you look at the protests that were in Los Angeles about illegals, they were basically  saying that people who are here illegally should stay.  So they do somehow affect policy.  They want driver's licenses.  That's the next point I was going to make.  Health insurance.  I'm glad you brought that up.  Then again, they were paying for the tax system if they didn't health insurance.  I was going to make that exactly right.  Why don't we listen to this guy bring the swine flu home.  Song home, yeah.  Oh, you're doing great.  Swine flu.  Yeah.  Hey. 
[02:11:00]  Hey.  Back up, singers.  Woo.  Woo.  But birds flew and SARS were bad.  But this fake scare is worse than that.  Solo.  Because then there is the swine flu.  Oh, God.  Obama says to wear a mask and stay home from school and win.  When you go and meet people, wash your hands and don't put them in your mouth. 
[02:11:30]  Can't get that part right.  He doesn't quite explain it.  This virus sure is scary.  This virus sure is scary.  That's all.  You don't want to finish it?  What fantastic show is that? 
[02:12:00]  Um, I don't know.  Free beer and hot wings, Z-Rock just told me.  Oh, it is?  Wow.  That's the name of the show.  Free beer and hot wings.  Because who doesn't love that?  That, of course.  People were speculating that perhaps it's Scorch.  Too well written.  Yeah.  You guys want another one?  From now on.  Oh, God.  How are you going to follow that?  I'd be from now.  You showed up and you got Jerry Ford to lose at Jimmy Carter. 
[02:12:30]  And when nobody caught you, we were all happy.  But now, swine flew back and we're going to be in trouble.  Holy shit.  Can any of these fucking people hit the right mark when they're singing?  What?  They missed it at?  Yeah.  The other guy was missing every time he went into the last fucking verse.  He'd start too early.  And then it sucked.  And now this one, he's like waiting, and he fucks it up.  Comes in much too soon.  It just flies through. 
[02:13:00]  We're going to be in trouble.  Hey, la, hey, la, the swine flew back.  A booster full of pus, you got to pop that bubble.  Hey, la, hey, la, the swine flew back.  The media loves to spread all of the fear.  Hey, la, hey, la, the swine flew back.  Stupid spoof songs are all that I hear.  Hey, la, hey, la, the swine flew back.  Hey, we know you're just a flu.  I can't take that. 
[02:13:30]  Hey, you're overrated too.  You came to us from Sobreton, Mexico.  Hey, la, hey, la, the swine flew back.  A bunch of people died because of health care photos.  Hey, la, hey, la, the swine flew back.  They say a pandemic, and we're going to have to grieve.  Hey, la, hey, la, the swine flew back.  I need a million deaths before I will believe.  Hey, la, hey, la, the swine flew back. 
[02:14:00]  Hey, we know you're just a flu.  Wow.  Jesus.  They should be fired for that.  Why?  Not for an offensive song or anything, but offensive like the song itself.  The way it was done was offending me.  Why'd they pick that song out of all of them?  Was the swine flew here before?  Because the swine flew was back.  Yeah, it's back.  Is it back?  It was back.  Yeah, back.  When was the last time I was here?  1976.  You might remember the swine flew along with Peter Frampton.  God, did Peter Frampton's album suck? 
[02:14:30]  You didn't like Peter Frampton Comes Alive?  That fucking album is horrible.  You got to take yourself to that time period, Jim.  No one had ever talked through a guitar before you, you know?  Is that what he was doing?  Dude, it's fucking unlistenable.  It's one of the greatest live albums of all time.  It's not.  Kiss Alive shit's in its mouth.  It's fucking awful.  Shit's in its mouth.  My Aunt Carrie, that reminds me of. 
[02:15:00]  Because she was a teenager when that came out.  You know, that's like that reminds me of.  Like my...  Yeah.  It's fucking awful.  Dude, you.  You.  One of the best-selling albums ever.  So what?  You're right.  Was that Frampton?  He was on his own then, right?  Who was he with before that?  Humble Pie.  Humble Pie.  Frampton's Camel.  Oh, baby, I love your way.  Oh, he's fucking...  What about a Peter Frampton man?  Oh, he should be fucking kicked.  So we've decided we do not like Frampton Comes Alive. 
[02:15:30]  It's fucking awful.  I find it nostalgic.  It's so bad he's saying a Kiss album is better than that.  I know, which is...  Kiss Alive is a great live album.  They're horrible to me.  No, they're not.  Kiss could be one of the worst bands ever.  Ever.  Who?  The who?  No, no.  Kiss.  Sorry.  I went to a...  Wanna rock and roll.  I went to the Kiss show.  Remember that?  At NAW?  We went to Kiss.  And I was like...  After it was over, I realized how few real hits they had.  Because they played them all, and it was like three. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah, they didn't have a tremendous amount of...  Beth, I think, was the biggest song they ever had.  Yeah, and then, you know, I wanna rock and roll.  That was a big hit, yeah.  And then...  But Gene even had to take credit for Beth, remember?  Oh, I know.  He couldn't even give Peter Criss a little spotlight.  Gene's a fucking douche.  Actually, Peter Criss came up with the song Sarah, and I told him, Sarah, sing the same  song, but say Beth.  Say Beth.  Or whatever it is.  What was the original name of that song?  So then I took him for all his money.  Right.  Because that's what I do.  Then I kicked him out of the band, because he wouldn't play the way I wanted him to. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Parasite's a great fucking Kiss song.  That's your favorite band, is Kiss?  No.  Besides Ozzy?  Sabbath is my favorite band.  I like Kiss a lot.  Kiss is more...  They have a nostalgia for me.  Basically, if you were a girl 12 years ago, you would have liked to spy.  That's basically like...  It's a joke, man.  It's a joke, man.  No, I...  Without their fucking costumes, they're a bad garage band.  Look, there's the one guy with the big shoes and the tongue, and...  They were on fake blood, fucking fire.  And there's the star child.  What is that?  Again, it was...  What a douche child.  And plus, like I said before...  Yeah, Paul Stanley's the star child. 
[02:17:00]  What was the 70s?  What does that mean?  Douchey.  Fuck it.  Ugh.  Look, marketing-wise, you have to say...  They knew how to market.  They were fucking very good.  Look how long his tongue is.  They stole...  I told you they stole...  If you say New York Dolls, I'll fucking buy your ankles.  They did it.  Shut up.  New York Dolls were doing that shit before them, dressing up like transvestites.  You should love them.  You, from Kiss, it's the Kiss coffin.  Yeah, yeah.  Just pouring themselves out.  Fucking jeans marketing of everything.  I have the Kiss credit card now. 
[02:17:30]  Paul, I got to defend one.  You could charge your Kiss merchandise.  How can we make money off of them when they're dead?  Yeah, yeah.  Wait, one point at a time.  You can still make money.  Kiss visits Tupac.  You know, shit, if you make some decent albums, you wouldn't have to sell fucking car keys at the end of your fucking shows.  Kiss sold...  They sold a hundred million albums.  80 tractor trailers full of shit.  It's the Kiss can opener.  They sell the most shit.  Dude, they...  Kiss...  Unapologetically.  They sold a hundred million albums.  You can't not Kiss.  They sold a hundred million albums. 
[02:18:00]  The catalog is as big as the phone book of stuff you can buy.  Tremendous example.  Don't fucking elaborate.  It's like Madonna.  If you can write a good song, you can keep your fucking clothes on.  I'm with Bill, by the way.  I think she wants to do all that yoga.  I'm with Bill.  Live at Leeds is an amazing live album.  Who's that by?  The Who.  The Who.  I saw them twice.  They don't like The Who.  I had a...  I don't hate The Who.  They're just overrated.  No, you don't like The Who.  Who, Who, Who, Who.  They were very overrated.  How do you say The Who was overrated, but Kiss wasn't?  Because Kiss has not judged the way The Who is in rock standards. 
[02:18:30]  Look, we all know Kiss lyrically was not up to par in a lot of bands.  Musically, they're not up to...  I mean, like, it's just...  So why are they a band?  What are they good whiffle ball players?  I know.  Well, I'll tell you what I like about them.  Musically, they were a little overrated, but, you know...  But Kiss is not known for that.  They were just known as a whole show...  You can't say The Who was overrated, though.  The Who was a monster band.  So what?  I still think they were overrated.  Oh, my God.  How were they overrated back then?  Because they're heralded as this amazing band.  The way the Rolling Stone writes about them, the way they dissed Sabbath for all those years, 
[02:19:00]  and they make The Who look like they were these amazing...  Or Zeppelin.  They were these amazing...  And then they fucking stole this shit.  I'm talking about Zeppelin.  Fuck them.  The Who was a good band.  I'm not saying Moon wasn't a great drummer.  Doctrine's a great singer.  And fucking Townsend was good.  But they were just overrated as a unit because they were fucking comfortable for fucking rock writers.  That's who they liked.  So that's who they came out.  Well, no, they came out...  Quadrophenia was fucking brilliant.  Was it the rock opera?  Fucking eat my ass home.  No, that was Tommy.  Fucking rock opera.  No, that was Tommy.  For the first time that I met you, I shot it.  No, that was Tommy. 
[02:19:30]  What about Who's Next?  But it was creative.  It was fucking here.  He doesn't know any better.  Who's in the title?  I get it.  Who are you?  That's us.  Who are you?  Who are you?  Who are you?  Who are you?  What?  If I hear you call...  This is coming in.  Jimmy has the musical taste of a five-year-old.  I like fucking...  Except the band doesn't have a lunchbox.  Jimmy doesn't like them.  I got to tell you, Jimmy.  To say Who's overrated is a rough one.  That's a rough one.  That's what you believe.  That's fine. 
[02:20:00]  But it's Sabbath.  That's a rough one.  I'll give you this, Jimmy.  Kiss and then the Partridge.  Then the Jonas Brothers.  I don't judge Kiss on the same level as Sabbath.  I wouldn't give them music with a sound.  I just like them.  They were from my childhood, so I like them.  You know?  Fucking...  Oh, my God.  What are some of those other Who songs that we all enjoyed?  Behind Blue Eyes.  Pinball Wizard.  Pinball Wizard.  I'm not saying the Who sucks.  Trip Kid.  Yeah.  I like that one.  That's like one of my favorites.  I even liked Eminence Front when they were getting a little older.  I even liked that one. 
[02:20:30]  Under the Raging Moon.  Under the Raging Moon.  It's such a genius thing.  I mean, it's like three notes and he found it.  And it was Roger Daltrey actually playing the guitar in that one, if you remember the video.  And he's like, that's all he could play.  It was...  Can we hear that?  And the whole song is just...  Let's hear the fucking...  Let's hear the amazing Who on Eminence Front.  The song they did for Under the Raging Moon that they did for Keith Moon when he died was fucking great.  They had like all these drummers on it. 
[02:21:00]  You know what I'm saying?  How about Roger Daltrey, Free Me?  Let's not forget about that one.  Right.  What about Pete?  Pete Townsend had some solo stuff.  Yes, it was called fucking kiddie porn.  Rough Boys.  Rough Boys.  Rough Young Boys.  Right.  That was one of Pete Townsend's songs.  That wasn't bad until he got busted doing research.  I was like, oh, I can't listen to Rough Boys anymore.  And they brought some synthesizers in.  Oh, this is terrific.  Yeah, but I mean, this wouldn't be the first song I played to a brand new Who fan. 
[02:21:30]  Why not?  This is great.  When this came out, though.  I said this was later on in their career and it was all right.  To Chase in the fucking Shaft movie.  Post-Keith Moon.  Yeah, they were already at it for about 15 years when this thing came out.  This is terrific stuff.  No, this is just a prelude.  Come on.  That's fucking cool riff.  This song's a shit.  You know?  I mean, they're not spitting blood, Jimmy.  I'm not comparing them to Kiss.  I'm not comparing them to Kiss.  Tall shoes. 
[02:22:00]  I wouldn't argue that point.  But Sabbath, I would argue.  I do like Gene Simmons shoes, though.  Yeah.  Where do I get a pair of them?  Seven-inch heels.  I put them on.  I was four foot seven.  I didn't spit blood because my wig caught on fire.  The star child and the devil wig man.  It's Emilio Estevez's wig on.  Corey has something on Kiss that I'm not really sure if this is true. 
[02:22:30]  Let's see what this is about.  Corey, go ahead.  Corey, caller.  Good morning, boys.  Morning.  Hi.  Hey, uh, I saw...  Good evening.  What, Corey?  Corey, start over.  We were goofing over the first part of your call.  I apologize.  Go ahead.  I saw an interview with Gene Simmons.  We talked about the fact that Kiss, a live album, was not a live album.  Why was it just...  What did it have?  Fucking, uh...  Fake applause.  Yeah, did it have stuff like that mixed in the background? 
[02:23:00]  Had to punch it up a little?  No, no, no, no.  The vocals couldn't be done.  Uh, I guess they're...  I don't want to say they stopped.  Baby.  Ugh.  No, you hear my little baby?  Follow-up question.  No, he's all, like, distracted by his kid.  Yeah, this is...  Hopefully so.  We'll try to get info on that.  Let's see how to Jim in Staten Island.  How you up?  Yeah, how's it going, guys?  Listen, Ian, I think he would like this because a lot of that song's about, like, drinking  and underage girls.  I mean, what's the big deal?  It's so fucking phony.  Just stop. 
[02:23:30]  You know, underage girls.  Look at Paul Stanley and tell me he was ever into girls.  Love, Gun.  You know...  I was made for loving you.  When I was growing up...  You're not making a good argument, sir.  I'm a Kiss fan.  When I was growing up, I liked Kiss like Jimmy did.  And then I kind of grew out of it when I learned about Zeppelin.  Yeah.  Believe it or not, Jethro Tull, I don't know why.  Oh, that...  And...  And, uh, Black Sabbath.  Jethro Tull is one of the best...  And then Kiss was, like, to me, I was done with them.  Yeah, I like...  It's one of the best rock roll songs of all time.  I've moved on.  I like...  Which one? 
[02:24:00]  Locomotive Breath.  Wait, wait.  No.  You like the...  Aqualung?  No, no.  It's one of the best rock songs of all...  I'm trying to...  Bungle in the Jungle?  No, it's Locomotive Breath.  The beginning of that...  It's one of the best fucking rock beats.  Yeah, you like that one?  It's fucking great.  Let's play it for Rich.  It's one of the best beginning.  Get a hold of yourself.  You really are panicking.  And when he played that...  I bought the Jethro Tull...  See, you're talking about Jethro Tull's hits. 
[02:24:30]  Who's Jethro Tull?  I had a friend, Rob DeStassi, he was all about Jethro Tull, and those albums were tootly,  tootly-doing a little too much.  Tootly-doo.  What about him and his dumb flute?  It's like, when you got past the hits of Jethro Tull, that guy was obsessed with his  stupid flute.  Tootly-tootly.  He could really play it, but it's like, why would you want to play it in a rock band?  This is Voss' song.  All right.  The beginning is when they break into the music.  Oh, with the piano first, though.  Fucking long piano concerto. 
[02:25:00]  Turn up.  Yeah, but this was perfect for the rock jock.  You could talk over it.  Oh, you could do weather, sports.  Weather.  Local news.  It'll be a high of 61 degrees today.  Cooler air blowing in tomorrow.  We're looking for a high of only 58.  58.  And believe it or not, the 93 is actually clear at this point.  Yeah.  Had some nice weather earlier on in the week, but we'll be getting back to that.  Summer should be here soon.  It is about 5 to 9, sitting here, just mellowing out. 
[02:25:30]  And most DJs that take on this intro, in the back of their head, they're like, how fucking  long is this goddamn intro?  It's amazing.  Traffic on the Gowanus is backed up pretty much all the way to the Verrazano Bridge.  So if you're taking that way in, maybe you could find an alternate route.  Yeah, so just kick back.  Stocks futures are up about 1.4%.  My relationship's going downhill. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, yeah.  If you need relationship help, Colin, we'll be taking your calls a little later in the program  about relationships.  I'm ready to punch Voss in the jaw.  Wait, what's so great about this?  This part, this isn't even the post either.  You can still talk.  And we're still talking.  Ladies and gentlemen, you might remember this from 1970-something.  I'll talk right over the fucking song.  I hate it. 
[02:26:30]  This is a tolerable...  No, this is a great song.  It's not great.  Did you love this song?  A guy walks in on his girl getting fucked by his best friend.  I didn't say I wouldn't joke off the chair.  I mean, I would say this isn't great.  It's not.  It doesn't hold up.  Do you like Hole in the Sky by Sabbath?  I don't even know.  Why would you?  I know a couple Sabbath songs.  I've never listened to Sabbath.  I know you haven't.  I was at their...  When they were at their all-time high, I was in crack houses.  You were 35.  Okay.  That's true.  I wasn't listening to music.  73, 74?  Oh, no. 
[02:27:00]  I was just doing coke.  71?  Why don't we go back to the phones?  A few more people on this.  Jesus, how old are you?  Brian in Ohio.  Brian.  Good evening.  Hey, Brian.  As far as musical talent goes, I would play Kiss after Dwight Yoakam's band from Slumblade.  Wow.  That's a great band.  Why don't you go home and practice, Randy?  Here it is.  Turn it up.  Turn it up.  It's too long.  It looks so good.  The drums. 
[02:27:30]  Play through it, goddammit.  You play through it.  Yeah.  Oh.  I reckon I like it.  Oh, my God.  He's up all late drinking.  He's got to be in Bill Cox's outfit to fix a rototiller the next day. 
[02:28:00]  How great is this?  It's looped.  It doesn't have that great surf guitar part.  Oh, the Dick Dale part.  Yeah, yeah.  The Dick Dale part.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Enough.  It's killing me.  Let's go to Adam in Jersey.  Adam, what's up?  Jimmy's debating stinks.  Why?  It stinks.  He's talking about the Frampton Live album, and after he comes at him, it sold more records 
[02:28:30]  than any other record at the time.  Jimmy's like, ah, who cares?  Then he comes back.  Kiss sells 100 million albums.  Are you recapping that?  Because I wasn't denying the popularity of Frampton.  I just think it stinks.  I think that they were saying that Kiss was just like, ah, who listened to him?  I mean, that's what I was taking about it.  But I don't like Frampton's album.  It was tremendously successful.  I think Kiss is a joke band.  I really don't know why Frampton Comes Alive sold as many albums as they did. 
[02:29:00]  I mean, it was perfect for the time.  I thought he was dead.  Right.  It was perfect for the time, and I think Chicks liked the cover.  Yeah.  I never liked Frampton.  His blowing hair, which blew off the top of his head a few short years later.  It's fucking awful, that album.  He's completely horseshoe balled now.  What's Frampton's third best song?  You got Baby I Love Your Way and Who Do You?  I feel like I do.  Yeah, then there's the other one.  What's the third one?  The whole album had hits on it.  That were on the radio? 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  I'm trying to think of another.  Oh, that one.  I know.  The third one was I'm a Queer.  That was a fucking good one.  Some of those other Frampton songs we got.  I don't know if I could come up with a third Frampton song.  Can you?  When I had that album, I only listened to that.  Those two, right?  Do you feel like I do?  Well, because that was like a 14-minute version, I think.  Yeah.  You fantasized that you were playing it in front of your high school.  And then all of a sudden you turned like 20 and then it just sort of ended.  What was the first concert you went to, Anthony? 
[02:30:00]  Oh, my God.  First concert, I think, was probably a bad one.  I think it was.  Oh, they're always bad.  Because I went with a chick and she wanted to see.  Here come the disclaimers.  You went by yourself and you were wearing a tube top.  Come on, be honest.  No, because honestly, why would I see Jackson Brown by myself?  Because that would make me a faggot.  He had one song.  Oh, that song for the roadies?  Yeah, stay.  That was his only song.  The face Bill made when I said that was like. 
[02:30:30]  Why don't you stay?  A doctor just gave him bad news.  He went like, oh.  Do you go to any of those outdoor concerts like the Pocono Raceway?  Why would I do that?  You didn't do any of those?  Like with 10 bands we're playing?  What the fuck am I?  Fucking 80 years old?  I never went to Altamont Speedway.  Yeah, I stabbed a guy.  When I was a kid.  I was fucking six years old.  You're not that old?  No.  Oh, you're fucking aging bad.  Oh, Jesus. 
[02:31:00]  Who's talking?  What the fuck?  Oh, we went to Pocono Outdoor Concert, Bad Finger, Emerson Lake and Palmer.  Fucking all these bands.  I would break every CD you own.  That's a good one.  Eagles.  Wow.  Eagles.  I like a little bad figure.  Is this Jackson Brown's version?  You guys ever go to that concert where someone has an extra ticket and you just go because  they got an extra ticket?  Yeah, you got an extra ticket.  You want to go?  Excuse to get fucked up.  I did that one time and I saw John Cougar, Mellencamp. 
[02:31:30]  Ew.  Carole King.  I've never been.  I only just remember it was my legs hurt because I'm just standing there and I was fucking  bored out of my mind.  Everyone would stand.  Like when you're sitting down, you're all stoned and fucking because people just pass  pot around to each other.  Now it's, you know, not so much.  So you'd like sit down and the band would start and everyone could see and then people  had to stand up and I was just like, oh fuck.  Now I got to stand to see this bullshit.  We would do blotter acid or windowpane and get all fucking paranoid. 
[02:32:00]  Or what?  Blotter acid or windowpane.  Bluto acid.  Blotter, windowpane.  And we'd go to the concert and then we'd start getting all fucking paranoid and freaked  out.  We're all fucking.  We had to see the Grateful Dead.  We were playing for five hours.  Like on the third hour, I started tripping, having a bad trip.  You know?  You started to feel like you're surrounded by smelly girls with hair under the arms?  Yeah.  Five fucking hours is fucking mad.  It's got vaginas that are all bits. 
[02:32:30]  Have you guys seen that YouTube clip that this kid was tripping on mushrooms and they put  him in a closet and he was talking to himself?  So they recorded everything that he was talking about and then they just animated it with like  a lizard saying it.  It's really bizarre.  I got to check that out.  And we should have got the third Frampton song.  We should have got the third Frampton song.  Yeah, I know there was one.  What is it?  It was Baby, I Love Your Way, Do You Feel Like I Do, and I'll give Mark the pleasure.  Mark in Jersey.  Hey, how are you guys?  All right, Mark.  Good evening. 
[02:33:00]  Show me the way.  Show me the fucking way.  Show me the fucking way.  God damn it.  You should have got that one.  No, you shouldn't have.  Thank you, sir.  Now this is a monster hit for Frampton.  Wow, wow, wow, wow.  Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  This is fucking terrible.  But he's using a talk box.  It reminds me of a more innocent time in my life.  That's right.  Riding to the grocery store in the back of a pacer.  I want to have you.  Yeah.  You know, not a care in the world.  You don't have any money.  No ID. 
[02:33:30]  Right.  Nothing.  You just fucking show up and somehow there was food.  I'm just happy to be alive.  A simpler time.  You know, thinking about the devil or darkness, you're just having fun.  No global warming.  Right.  I thought that it was great.  You got your bicycle.  Turned out that gas shortage was just a fluke.  Yeah.  This is the perfect music for this time.  A little touch football with your friends after school.  Yeah, the Vietnam War just ended.  You didn't even need to tackle.  Here it comes, Jim.  It was all touch football.  Here it comes.  The big chorus. 
[02:34:00]  Turn it up.  That's brilliantly written.  Show me the way.  Every day.  But Kiss couldn't write lyrics.  Maybe he painted Saturn around his eyeball and fucking the rest of his face black.  Do you see what I'm talking about?  The perception.  Lyrically, this guy's shit.  I want you to show me the way.  Every day.  Oh, it was simple.  It was just him and his guitar up there, Jimmy. 
[02:34:30]  That's two more things that should have been up there.  And his talk box or whatever the fuck it was called.  That's all he had.  He had a tube on the microphone.  And he would put it in his mouth.  He would fucking suck that thing like a dick.  Someone's playing drums.  Yeah.  What, he had fucking cymbals on his legs?  He had a band.  He had a band up there.  Spoke Mayo on keyboards.  Spoke Mayo.  Remember the whole album.  He's got that bass drum behind him.  He's getting with his heel.  And this is like around the same time Boston's first album came out. 
[02:35:00]  Exactly.  That was their only album.  Boston's first album?  Massively successful.  There's not a bad song on that album.  I have just the opposite take.  Oh, my God.  I love it.  I got to admit, that was one of those albums.  I love Boston's first album.  When you heard it for the 36,000th time.  You were done with it?  Oh.  It wasn't a bad song.  Hit your ride.  I wrote a fucking four-play long time.  More than a feeling.  He had a cassette tape of that.  It got stuck in his player. 
[02:35:30]  And that was the only thing he could listen to for an entire fucking summer.  Oh, wow.  That would kill it.  Oh.  I never need to hear them again.  More than a feeling is a good song.  When he lit those grills.  No, I'm kidding.  Oh, shit.  That was his best work.  Exactly.  That guy, he was such a great guy, too.  We met him a few times.  When he fucking wrote that song.  Jesus, that's two days in a row.  I'm just going to shut up.  What was the other one?  I used to make fun of sticks when that guy comes in.  He's a fucking great guy.  Yeah.  Brad Delp was a solid dude.  Yeah.  Sucks he went out that way.  Exactly. 
[02:36:00]  Don't put a hibachi by the stereo inside.  Who the fuck is this?  Boston.  Yeah, it's one of their slow little love ballads.  This is fucking hideous.  I know.  It goes back to the time like Bill was talking about.  More than a feeling is a good song.  It's not hurting anybody.  You're just driving from your horrible job.  Mindless.  To go do something else.  Mindless.  Shrinking age was 18.  Yeah.  Hey, if I'm old enough to diet for this country.  Yeah.  To be able to drink. 
[02:36:30]  You just bought your six pack to drink it in the woods with your pals.  With pull tabs.  Right.  Hairy bushes for everyone.  Yeah.  Wow.  Oh, shit.  I remember.  There we go.  A jar of some of the junkies.  Fucking memories loose over here.  Come on, Rich.  You get your first tattoo down in Providence.  I was trying to get on my back.  Okay.  Can you put another song on by this fucking awful group?  Well, which one you want to play for me?  Not More Than a Feeling, which I like. 
[02:37:00]  I'm trying to remember what else was on.  Smoke was.  You're playing all the love songs.  The lovey-dovey ones.  You're not rocking.  It's More Than a Feeling?  No, I said not that one, which I like.  What else is on the album?  I forgot.  Who the fuck's typing these in?  That lady from the cigarette commercial?  When this thing comes in, it's just a total love.  Post-Freedom Rock.  Freedom Rock.  Well, turn it up, man.  Turn it up, man.  Douchebag.  But again, this was overly processed, so this wasn't fucking.  Yeah, dude. 
[02:37:30]  This is a studio creation.  Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  Come on.  Tom Schultz, right?  He was a genius.  Who's clapping?  You know what's great about this time is like, it's still so early on in this shit that any  sort of bar chords you put together, you just...  Yeah, it was new.  You know what this was?  What made this band was Bradley Delft's voice and the harmonies, and it was all Bradley Delft. 
[02:38:00]  I've never heard him called Bradley Delft.  Bradley Delft.  And the guitars were doubled.  It was like the harmony guitar.  The Jimmy Page thing.  Yeah, the double guitar.  And his voice, too.  Yeah, that's what I mean.  His voice was great.  He had a great range.  Ten Brad Delfts singing at the same time.  This is like a late night infomercial.  Isn't it?  I love these songs.  Growing up with these songs was fantastic.  You could get all of them.  Where would you get a collection like this?  You couldn't get one.  You'd have to spend thousands. 
[02:38:30]  Thousands of dollars and look like a douche at every record.  Like my kids.  Who could teach me how to make spare ribs with my head on the hibachi?  Brad Delft.  Oh, poor Brad.  He's got his head squeezed in a George Foreman grill.  It's not working.  Oh, the handcladding.  There it is.  Da-da-da-da-da-da.  Rock and roll band's a good one, sure.  Now we're getting requests for four plays, another good one. 
[02:39:00]  Could we have four play?  Well, four plays, a long piece that just starts building.  All right, give me a little four play.  We could talk about four plays.  I don't understand.  It leads into a long time.  I hated this.  I hated Boston.  That's a good song.  Thank you.  Let me go to the phones as this thing slowly develops.  Vinny in Poughkeepsie.  Vinny.  Hey, what's up, fellas?  What's up?  Hi, Vinny.  Good evening.  Good evening.  Billy Bird.  Tell Billy Bird.  Drinking out of cups. 
[02:39:30]  You tell him.  Oh, the YouTube video that you were telling him.  It's all about you guys.  The kid in the closet.  Oh, yeah.  Drinking out of cups.  It's called drinking from cups or something like that.  All right.  Okay, thank you.  And someone is saying, I don't even know this.  Mike in Boston writes, smells like Teen Spirit was Cobain goofing on this riff.  More than the feeling riff, I guess, by Boston.  No way.  Really?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I've got to listen to that.  I've got to listen to that.  This is foreplay.  Yeah. 
[02:40:00]  I mean, it's shit.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  This is shit you could figure out on a keyboard within 20 minutes of buying it.  You know, Goodbye Yellow Book Road was written in one night.  They wrote that whole album in one night.  Carolina man giving Bill Burr some props.  He's going to be at Caroline's starting tonight.  Bill Burr, as usual, has his finger on the pulse. 
[02:40:30]  Drinking out of cups on YouTube is hilarious.  It's totally visual, but I strongly recommend you guys check it out.  It is audio from when a guy was locked in a closet on acid.  It sounds like he's basically trying to talk himself out of having a bad trip.  He's just going, oh, oh, okay, Mr. Balloon Hands.  Mr. Balloon Hands.  Oh, really?  I don't need that.  I've got to see this now.  Is that a chair?  It's not my problem.  Fuck that.  And for some reason they animated it.  Obviously they couldn't film him, and they just have a lizard saying it. 
[02:41:00]  I don't know.  It's kind of funny.  It adds a whole other level to it.  Nothing was worse than when that bad trip thing crept into your head.  And that's the thing that sucked about even doing mescaline or anything like that.  It was thinking, like, I just don't want to have the bad trip.  I just want to have a good time.  And you don't know if you're going to have the bad time.  We were all tripping up in the garage where the band played, and we were all tripping.  And this guy, Chris, who gets up and falls and smashes his face, and blood is pouring out of his face. 
[02:41:30]  And we had to kick him out.  We said, you have to leave.  You're freaking us out.  Because you're freaking us out.  I was getting that whole bloody face in here.  It's reminding me of the guy looking in the mirror in Poltergeist.  Get out of here.  How long is this hunk of shit song?  It just scares you.  Travis?  Eight minutes.  Ugh.  Just tell him to turn it up.  Oh.  Turn it up, man. 
[02:42:00]  There you go.  Now, this song, or?  This is garbage.  I just realized I could never go to war with you, Opie.  I'm just giving you a hand signal.  You're giving me the hand signals.  And you're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  You're like, insurgents, you fucking idiot.  You're in Danny's seat, so you usually have to tell Danny to tell them, because we can't  see those guys in the other room.  Whatever.  You want to take a break?  I have to take a break.  Yeah, might as well.  Get a go, audio.  Phones are lit, but somebody had instant feedback saying that we suck today, so.  All right. 
[02:42:30]  How about it?  Somewhere else, man.  How about the phones being lit?  Any Kiss fans?  Not really.  Blow me.  Not really.  Why would I do that?  Tool.  Smoking from Boston was awesome.  Jim's musical taste sucks.  Can't forget about Fleetwood Mac.  You tell me where to go.  Fleetwood Mac.  How about my musical taste sucks?  Let's go with that one.  All right.  Let's go to Mark in North Carolina.  You can turn down the Boston.  Thank you.  Hi, Mark.  Now, what don't you like that I like?  Good evening.  Good evening.  Pussy.  Your comedy is amazing.  You're the fucking funniest man on the planet.  Thank you.  But if it's not Kiss and it's not Black Sabbath, it sucks. 
[02:43:00]  That's not true.  There was a lot of bands back then that were really good.  Heart, when they came out, was fucking rocking, dude.  Dude, I don't just like Kiss and Sabbath.  Heart?  Tom Petty, that's rocking shit, dude.  I don't hate Tom Petty.  I like one song by him.  I hate it all.  I like fucking, I like Harry Chapin.  I love Jim Croce.  I fucking love Bob Marley.  I have very varied taste in music.  Kisses from my...  No, that's not true.  I like some Harry Chapin. 
[02:43:30]  I like Sitting by the Fire with my...  But Jimmy, what about rock bands?  My lover.  Rock bands?  Yeah, you're looking at a lot of...  Hold on, seriously though.  Because you're looking at a lot of guys in the room that probably like The Who, Zeppelin,  Pink Floyd.  I like Queen.  Yes, I like Queen.  Floyd?  I like Pink Floyd a lot.  I like Zeppelin a lot.  I don't hate The Who, but I don't really like him.  I like Zeppelin.  I like fucking Floyd.  I like Queen.  What about Yes?  You like Yes?  Steve Miller.  Not a big fan.  No, I don't like...  Really for you?  Yes was great.  Steve Miller band?  You could pull a Yes album out of the sleeve and just not see one line on the whole side 
[02:44:00]  of an album.  It's just one song.  That's when you knew you made a mistake at the record store.  You're like, oh, shit.  I knew I should have picked up Charlie Daniels.  Right.  You see three grooves.  One on one side, two on the other.  Oh, great.  What the fuck is John Anderson up to this time?  Police, Tom Petty.  They stunk.  The police stung.  Just please don't stunk.  No, you can't say the police stunk.  I like the police stunk.  Who?  I didn't like that.  I love the police stunk.  You can't say they stunk.  I don't know.  Kenny Loggins. 
[02:44:30]  They were good.  We can all rank on Kenny Loggins.  Your musical taste, Rich.  No, I got it.  I'm great.  It's so fucking bad.  Are you out of your mind?  I'll give you fucking fives.  First of all, Motown.  The Temptations are the best band ever.  How old are you?  How old are you?  How old are you?  Are you saying the Temptations were one of the...  That suck ass!  Are you crazy?  Yeah, yeah.  Don't do that to yourself.  Are you saying you don't like the Temptations?  No, I hate Motown.  Why would you argue with someone who's saying something like that? 
[02:45:00]  I fucking hate Motown.  Wow.  The Temptations are one of the best.  Give me a Temptations song.  Ball of Confusion, Get Ready, Papa Was a Rolling Stone.  I like Vanilla Fudge's version better of Get Ready or something else.  It's one of the...  Sly and the Family Stone, Sly and the Family Stone.  Whatever it was.  Vanilla Fudge, was that with Common Advice?  No.  And Sly was great, too.  They were a great band, Sly and the Family Stone.  So I have a great taste in music.  I like Sly and the Family Stone.  I thought they were good.  I have a great taste in music.  Like him.  I like anywhere from fucking... 
[02:45:30]  Come on, man.  You guys are a bad band.  Are you crazy?  The Temptations are probably the voices.  You don't like the Supremes, dude?  Yeah.  Ain't no mountain high.  Yeah, I just...  I don't like the Motown sound.  The Supremes.  I don't like it.  Love Child.  I never had it to the Supremes, but yeah, there's Smokey Robinson.  That's a bunch of good music.  How about the Spinners?  I'm coming home. 
[02:46:00]  That's fucking great.  Tears of a Clown.  How about Ken Heath and his orchestra?  What do you like?  Hot Tuna?  Shut up, stupid.  I have a great taste in music.  You sprinkle this shit in.  That's all.  You just sprinkle it in a little bit.  I'm not fucking going a whole day of Motown.  I'm not doing a Spinner's Greatest Hits CD anytime soon.  And for the most part, I will fucking punch out of Motown.  During this...  This song, I might fucking sit through.  It's kind of nostalgic.  So during this time period, were you more of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons guy?  Yes.  No.  I wasn't around during this time.  Well, who did you listen to during this time? 
[02:46:30]  Before the Who and the Zeppel came out, all right?  You're 32.  You just got your last pink slip.  I want to know, who were you listening to?  Bomb-a-bomb-bomb, bangin-dang-dang.  I was listening to the white people and they ripped all these people off.  Dude, Dion and the Belmonts are the shit.  You like Dion and the Belmonts?  Dude, you have to listen to them within the context of what was out then.  I'm telling you, that was fucking unreal.  Well, you could say that about anything.  You could say that about fucking, you know...  Can't say that about Kiss.  The 1800s music.  You know, the context of the Civil War.  This fucking was kicking ass. 
[02:47:00]  This is like...  Dude, if you knew some of the shit that I listened to...  And were you thinking about Keep Me Hanging On by Vanilla Fudge?  Keep Me Hanging On by Vanilla Fudge, but that isn't the original version.  No, I know.  But you said I'd rather hear Vanilla Fudge's version.  We can all agree this stuff sucks.  I like this stuff.  At the hop.  Can we agree with something here?  The Beatles dropped the atomic bomb on this whole genre.  No, this isn't good.  But Dion and the Belmonts, I like them. 
[02:47:30]  I like this.  The Wanderer, that's a great song.  The Wanderer.  It's a little overplayed.  Absolutely.  At this point.  And one of the biggest deuce chill moments ever in cinema is that movie, The Wanderers.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And they sing it an a cappella.  And then that guy, he does the sax solo.  Yeah.  And he's acting in it.  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  Oh, it's horrible.  Kill yourself.  This song is good if you're sitting on a stoop somewhere.  In front of a burning barrel.  Yeah, in Queens or Brooklyn.  This stuff is just dated, though.  It's hard to judge this stuff because it's 50s and blah. 
[02:48:00]  You dress like Potsy.  The only good thing about this was the blacks and whites water fountains.  You're dressed like a barber.  I don't think it's fair to judge this stuff by today.  It's very dated stuff.  We should take a break.  1950s, this is a badass song, man.  Elvis, I love Elvis.  We'll go cruising down the fucking boulevard, huh?  We can't get to all the phones.  Let me go through them.  Soup up your car.  Make sure we don't have to take any of these before we go to break. 
[02:48:30]  I think we've got the Iron Sheet coming in in a few minutes.  Iron Sheet.  Sunshine Johnny.  Ace Freely influenced some of the best guitarists ever.  That's coming in.  Talkbox Frantan uses the same thing Kanye West uses.  Exactly.  Boom.  The ironic thing about Brad's suicide, Brad Delp's suicide, was he was a vegan.  He cooked vegan stuff on a grill.  How about talking about a band that's not on Social Security?  Once again, can't forget about Fleetwood Mac.  Yes, you can.  Yes, you can.  Jim, do you know what? 
[02:49:00]  What's up yesterday's day in history was for Black Sabbath?  What was the date?  I do not.  Yesterday was the 20th.  Was it their 40th anniversary?  Well, let's find out.  Let's find out here.  Let's go to Chris.  Good evening.  Chris?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  Jimmy, I know you're a big fan of Black Sabbath, so I want to know if you knew what this date  30 years ago Black Sabbath history was.  30 or 40?  30 years.  Well, if it's 30 years ago, I'm going to guess it was Ozzy being asked to leave the band.  No, I know it.  Well, I guess you said it.  Hold on.  I know it. 
[02:49:30]  Oh, oh.  Uh, Ronnie James Dio.  Attaboy.  Oh, that was it.  Yes.  35 years ago, I toured Ronnie James.  Wow.  Well, in 79, they were touring with Ronnie?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Give yourself a bail.  Are you sure about that?  I did not know that.  Fucking asshole.  Wow.  In 79?  Yeah.  Let's keep that bit alive, please.  I didn't know that.  Please, no.  I can't believe he lingered longer on that one.  How much, how much, 30 years they, uh, started with Ronnie James? 
[02:50:00]  I didn't realize it was 79.  Isn't that crazy?  Yeah.  Let's say hi to, uh, Steve and Jerry's and then we got to go to the, uh, break.  Steve.  Break.  Morning, boys.  Hey.  Hello.  How you doing?  Hi, buddy.  Good evening.  Yeah, we, uh, the first week that Boston album came out, I was in a garage band.  We were playing the high schools, dances, whatnot.  My best friend we grew up with, we got in a fist fight over that album.  He put that album on and I just literally wanted to rip his head off.  I called it bubble gum and the fist started flying. 
[02:50:30]  So, that's what Boston is all about.  I think the problem with Boston, they couldn't, like, duplicate that stuff in concert, right?  Wasn't that said about them a bunch of times?  Yeah, it was all, he overdubbed all the harmonies.  So, it made it really hard to perform those songs live.  Yeah, it's like when Zeppelin used to try to do a whole lot of love.  Oh, that's Ant's bit.  Oh, okay.  Ant's all, no, I'm just saying Ant's all over that.  Way down and, woman, you need a love.  I'm not even talking about it.  It's like, no, you didn't sing it like that on the album. 
[02:51:00]  It came out, love.  And he's like, love.  And then put the mic out to the crowd.  You fucking, Robert Plant.  Was a golden god.  He sucked an ass.  The guy couldn't fucking sing his songs.  The albums, whatever.  I don't know what they did in that studio.  But when he hit the stage.  It was the army of guitars.  Yeah.  When he hit that stage.  You need fooling, baby. 
[02:51:30]  I'm not.  Everything was tuned.  Na, na, na.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  He sounded like Bowser.  Yeah.  Get a job.  It was horrible.  We're going to break.  Iron Sheik's coming in.  I didn't shit good.  I just got something handed to me, Sam and Derek.  Iron Sheik had some requests, I think, before he came into the Opium Anthem.  No Jews from Rock.  I don't know.  Let's listen to this.  Good news.  Later today, the Iron Sheik returns to the Opium Anthony show.  And lucky for us, his manager sent over a quick one sheet to make this interview go as smoothly as possible. 
[02:52:00]  The Iron Sheik's promoting his roast on DVD.  The Iron Sheik is signed on to do an iPhone app.  That's exciting.  The Dye WWE has canceled the Iron Sheik's book because they claim with their PG rating that his book is too controversial.  The WWE wants the Sheik to go to rehab.  The Iron Sheik's drug use is pretty bad and his health is, quote, going downhill. 
[02:52:30]  The Iron Sheik would be good for celebrity rehab or another reality show.  And finally, the Iron Sheik would rather do his drugs than pay his house bills.  Tune in later on as the Iron Sheik joins the Opium Anthony show.  Oh, my God.  Now we're still live.  It could get really good with the Iron Sheik today.  Champion.  Champion.  He was WWF Champion World Greatest Wrestle Greco-Roman Wrestle. 
[02:53:00]  Oh, Anthony and Opium show.  And the best wrestling boots ever.  Oh, of course.  With the curly fries.  Stereotypical curly tips.  Yeah.  I just stepped off a carpet.  Yeah.  Carpet.  I couldn't stand most of those.  Rich.  We're still on the air.  You know that.  Well, I'm sorry.  I hated most of them.  We're just like sitting around with these headphones on.  Still on the air.  Oh, I didn't.  Jesus.  You should have told them. 
[02:53:30]  That would have been a good one.  What's that?  You should have told them.  We could have really had to.  Oh, really?  I didn't know where it was.  All right.  The Iron Sheik, hopefully next.  We're not going to get much out of them, but I think it'll be some flying radio.  We'll see.  Oh, there you go.  Oh, here we go.  Now we're rocking.  Oh, wait.  No, we're not.  No.  Look at the Iron Sheik.  He's got a big belt.  Let the song play through.  He'll be done. 
[02:54:00]  Is he on his way in?  He's a legend.  Well, he started making his way in about 10 minutes ago.  He's getting there.  He's limping a little bit.  He does look like Robert Kelly.  Yeah, these guys put their bodies on the line to entertain us.  Iron Sheik.  Iron Sheik.  Iron Sheik.  Iron Sheik.  Iron Sheik.  Iron Sheik.  Iron Sheik.  Iron Sheik.  Yeah.  Iron Sheik.  Beautiful.  Welcome back to the Opie Nanty Show. 
[02:54:30]  Good to see you, everybody here.  Yeah.  Pleasure for me to you guys invite me here.  Pleasure for us.  Thank you, sir.  You want to see us?  Yeah, screw pleasure for.  Yeah.  Pleasure for you.  Pleasure for us.  Not for Opie and Nanty.  Oh, my God.  Ring.  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  Is that a hubcap?  There we go.  One copy.  That is the Intercontinental Championship belt, buddy.  We'll just pass it around.  I don't know what he used to hold.  Pass it around.  Show everybody.  I don't know.  We'll find him.  We'll find out.  Yeah, he brought in one DVD.  It's good.  How about we rattle those mics around a little bit more? 
[02:55:00]  They should have brought in more than one.  Yeah, they should have brought in more than one.  That's a big belt.  See?  You should have brought in more than one.  Now we have more.  Oh, good.  Give everybody one.  Pleasure for me to have one.  Who's in this?  Let me have the DVD box.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Is that a championship belt or what?  That belt is, Jack, a giant.  That is a black belt.  We have bulletproof.  No, no.  We have more.  That is a big belt there, Mr. Sheik. 
[02:55:30]  Is he a rapper?  What is that?  He's an old school wrestler, my friend.  He's a legend.  He's a Hall of Famer.  Come on, Rich Voss.  Show up here and I'll generate my Hall of Fame ring.  Oh, Hall of Fame ring.  Hall of Fame ring.  Look at the size of that son of a bitch.  Wow.  I can wear that as a cock right now.  That's something.  I don't seek them in sight.  Well, yeah.  It says Pete Rose World Series.  Exactly.  That's Iron Sheik.  No, his belt is the heavyweight champion. 
[02:56:00]  That doesn't seem too heavy.  Is that real gold?  It's solid aluminum.  Whoa, whoa.  That's good stuff.  Can we get a mic on there, Sheik?  Wow.  We got to move that mic.  That's a big ring.  Yes.  All right.  How are we going to do this?  No idea.  Iron Sheik, how are you, sir?  Oh, I'm doing fine, sir.  Like I said, pleasure for me to come back again to Manhattan from Tehran, Iran, to the Madison  Staregarden, New York, number one radio station in the world. 
[02:56:30]  Anthony and Opie, Opie, Adam.  Also, I'm going to start.  Wait.  So you're going to be at Madison Square Garden?  I was Madison Staregarden.  Yes, Opie.  He was, remember?  Exactly.  Remember when he went to Madison Square Garden?  Three times I'll come champion.  Single, tag team, battle royale.  Right, right.  The most famous arena in the world.  Matching.  Who did you beat to become the heavyweight champion again? 
[02:57:00]  Good question.  Six years.  Nobody beat Mr. Bob Buckland.  I put him in the camel crotch.  God bless him.  He was a great, great All-American from Minnesota.  But if you ask Mr. Bob Buckland, who was the toughest appointment you had, he's going to say  Arnold Schick, not Hulk Hogan, Arnold Schick.  That's because I make him give up.  And his manager, Arnold Scholler, God bless him, he's going to run the tower. 
[02:57:30]  And I come, the most famous athlete from Middle East to the Madison Square Garden, New York, number one in the world.  And you put him in the camel crotch there, and that was it.  He beat Bob Buckland.  Yes, six years, nobody beat him.  I put him in the camel crotch, Mr. Bob Buckland, Kuwait.  And then they tell me, no, Schick, lose the belt to Hulk Hogan.  Oh, boy.  I said, if Hulk Hogan can beat me, he can have my gold medal, and he can my belt. 
[02:58:00]  But otherwise, I'm going to break the Hulk Hogan leg.  I take the belt to different company for $100,000.  But the hand beat me, I don't buy that hand.  My average is $10,000 to $15,000 a week in New York with the WWF.  Did you lose to Hulk Hogan?  I'm sorry? 
[02:58:30]  Did Hulk Hogan beat you?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  He beat me, but for $1 million.  Money top.  Money top.  Bullshit.  I can't give you a million.  That's it.  Otherwise, I'll break his back.  I'll break.  I'll have him in the camel crotch.  You'll rip that mustache right off his face, right?  I know.  Fuck him.  I'm sorry?  You took the dive.  I said you'll rip his mustache right off his face, right?  Exactly.  There you go.  Plus, Hulk Hogan is not my class.  I tell Hulk Hogan, if you beat me, you can have my gold medal three times all American I am, 
[02:59:00]  and you can have my belt.  Otherwise, otherwise, how much I get.  And Kennedy McMahon said, Sheik, put him over.  I know he's not your class.  He's a bodybuilder.  The guy used the juice, testosterone.  The juice?  He's not my class.  And then I lost my belt for $1 million to that Hollywood brown jabroni faggot, Hulk Hogan.  Oh, boy.  You don't like Hulk Hogan there, Iron?  All right.  Hulk Hogan, I lost the man. 
[02:59:30]  He put the baby oil on top of her daughter's box.  Oh, right.  Or he have sex with his daughter's girlfriend.  What kind of fucking man he is?  So I lost the son of a bitch.  Hulk Hogan, go fuck yourself.  You can't even suck my tennis cock.  Give him.  Wow.  Relax.  Give him the inhaler.  That's fantastic.  So how about his wife?  His wife is a...  His wife, she's a gold digger.  But before that, she was a good lady. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah.  Very nice lady.  No.  Now she fucks the pool boy.  Oh, man.  But wait, let's get back to you.  Shut up.  She's a fucking gold digger.  I wish I could fuck that bitch because she needed 10, 11 cock to fuck her fucking bitch pussy.  Let's get back to your 10-inch cock.  Holy...  All you need is Freddie Blassett to be nodding behind.  Exactly.  That's the greatest thing ever. 
[03:00:30]  Oh, my God.  But how do you really feel, Iron?  How do you really feel?  Fred Blassett said that pencil gig a leak.  Pencil dick neck.  If he was not from Hulk Hogan.  If he was not from our chic.  Still you'd be in the gay bar.  Bonser.  He's kind of Hollywood and soft.  Don't you think, Hogan?  He's not like a real wrestler.  He's a Hollywood kind of soft guy.  He's a fucking shithead.  He's a drug addict.  He put a testosterone deco in his butt.  That body is artificial. 
[03:01:00]  I'm 60, 7 years old.  What?  Yeah, I can kick his butt right now, even if I'm handicapped.  And you can't...  I found out you can't call somebody a drug addict.  Except rich boss.  Sheik, who are some of the other guys you didn't like in wrestling?  That's a great question.  Another one.  That fucking cocksucker.  Ultimate Warrior.  Ultimate Warrior.  Ultimate Warrior.  Yeah.  He's a male prostitute.  Yeah. 
[03:01:30]  His wife, she writes a book to everybody who knows that fucking Ultimate Warrior.  Another cocksucker.  Male prostitute.  I love to suplex him, put him in the camel collage, and I fuck his ass with 10-inch my cock.  But then that would make you gay, aren't she?  10-inch my cock.  Well, you know, I'm not supposed to fuck the son of a bitch because I'm a Muslim.  I'm a Shia Muslim.  But I'm going to fuck his ass with a box beer bottle. 
[03:02:00]  He's a Muslim as he takes his beer from the jail.  You know, I'm a Muslim.  I said it's a Jew.  I'm not supposed to drink alcohol.  But the reason I drink back's beer, after I finish up to action, fuck Hogan, Hogan ass,  or Arturo Borr ass with my German back's beer bottle.  What do you have a problem with Ultimate Warrior? 
[03:02:30]  What's wrong with him?  Yeah, because that son of a bitch, my agents, take me by his table to Eric, take a picture,  and he sell it.  And then, and then I go over there.  I said, hello, Mr. Arturo Borr, he didn't shake out to me.  I said, why?  What is wrong?  He said, Shiki, baby, you go tell everybody I'm a gay, I'm a faggot.  That's because I don't want to shake out to you.  And then I said, Eric, Ultimate Warrior is not my class. 
[03:03:00]  Why you take me over there?  And I slapped Eric's face.  Oh, shit.  Because that jabroni Jew, he loved the money, and he want to make money.  That's because he want to take me over there.  But Bruno Sammartino, Bruno Sammartino, up here, and Anthony, Bruno Sammartino tell Eric,  don't never, ever again take the sheik over there by his table. 
[03:03:30]  I go by his table, he didn't shake out to me.  And I said, if you think, I tell Arturo Borr, if you think, I said it, you are gay or you faggot,  I'm sorry, I didn't say it, that was in the Enquirer magazine, in New York time,  they found out you are gay, you are cocksucker, you're somebody, you want to fuck your ass for money.  But I'm sorry.  He said, no, sheik, I don't, I still, I don't want to forgive you.  I don't want to shake out to you. 
[03:04:00]  So I said, you don't want to forgive me, you don't want to, you don't want to forgive about me.  I take my jacket off, I tell him, no, you are real cocksucker, you are real fucking male prostitute.  And then he said, somebody call police.  I said, police in New Jersey, they're nice to me.  I don't bother the police, but if you want to scare them police, fuck you piece of shit.  Call police.  Police, 10 FBI come, take me, take me back to the Eric table. 
[03:04:30]  So Eric, tell him that was your fault.  Tell him.  Tell him, Jew.  Are you the Jew he's referring to?  Yeah, he's a Jew jabroni.  He's a Jew jabroni.  I'm a Jew.  He's a Jew brony.  No, you're done.  Eric.  Why don't you take me away?  Hold on, Eric.  I'm done.  All right, Eric.  Okay.  We were at this big football convention, and we had the wrestlers there.  And I like to have Sheik take pictures with different people.  It's good for business opportunities.  And we went over to the Ultimate Warrior. 
[03:05:00]  You know, can we take a picture?  It's like, no, go away.  You've been bad-mouthing me.  You know, yada, yada, yada.  Things get fired up.  I try to calm it down.  The next thing I know, I'm getting slapped because he turns his energy on to me.  And, you know, it's just a bad situation.  Who slapped you?  He did?  The Sheik slapped me.  The Sheik.  Is he Puerto Rican?  He's Iranian.  Oh.  Why'd he slap you?  Because he was mad that I took him over there and that Warrior disrespected him.  So it's my fault for bringing him over there.  And he's kind of got a point.  She's got a good point. 
[03:05:30]  It was your fault.  It was your fault.  Well, you know, I brought...  I'm a legend.  I'm old man.  You don't have to hang out with that guy.  I brought...  I mean, exactly.  I brought Bruno over there.  He took a picture with Bruno.  I thought he'd be able to take a picture with him.  Slap him again.  I didn't know that the Ultimate Warrior...  I love you.  You son of a...  Wait a second.  He said shit can't take me off.  Yes.  Yes.  Wait a second.  The Ultimate Warrior should have came over to you.  I love you.  And bow down.  Exactly.  Why did he bring you to the Warrior?  The Ultimate Warrior doesn't realize that this business is, you know, what it is. 
[03:06:00]  And, you know, Sheik does what he does.  And it's, you know, whatever.  Sheik is a true champion.  He takes it, but he's taking it real.  The Ultimate Warrior is a piece of shit.  I love Sheik.  He is a piece of shit.  Give Palestine back their land.  Chaplain.  Chaplain.  Look at that chaplain.  Greco-Roman wrestle, too.  And the greatest country in the world.  Terran.  Terran.  What Madison Square Garden.  Ultimate Warrior.  Cut sucker.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Yes. 
[03:06:30]  So, that son of a bitch.  Yes.  Take me over there.  That motherfucker.  Because they want to take a picture to his Senate.  And then Bruno Sammartino says to him.  Uh-oh.  What happened?  That was a wrong thing Eric did.  Yeah.  Because for the money.  Yeah.  Well, you know how they are with the money there, Sheik.  Exactly.  You got to invite this guy to your house, Ed.  He lives in a lot of the same stuff you do.  Hey, Sheik.  Hey, Sheik.  Why do you work with this Eric Q guy there?  Well, he's better than nothing. 
[03:07:00]  All right.  We've been together 22 years there.  22 years.  22 years we've been professionally married.  And wow.  Whatever I make, it takes a half my money.  And it's still not enough.  All right.  I should take 80% because at least you'd have something when it's all said and done.  Instead of you spending all your money on drugs.  Oh.  Oh, Jesus.  Iron Sheik, what's up with you and the drugs?  Is that true?  Well, that's...  Yes.  That son of a bitch.  He tell everybody, I smoke what I want. 
[03:07:30]  Well, it's true.  I love...  It's true.  I love my German beer.  I love my water.  His fucking knees hurt after years of wrestling.  Yeah.  Give him a little weed.  Let him smoke some pot, you fucking...  What are you going to let him smoke weed?  I'm not going to let him do anything.  If his legs are hurting...  He can take a prescription medicine.  He's so cheap.  I'll give him a naprecent.  Have the doctor prescribe a naprecent for him.  This is...  Oh, yeah?  What?  A doctor friend of yours probably, right?  Yeah, exactly.  A cousin or...  Naprecent, indocin, alphon, motrin.  We've got a whole bunch of anti-inflammatories he can take. 
[03:08:00]  This is exhausting.  How do you guys hang out?  Listen.  Hey, Iron Sheik, have you seen his cock?  Does he got a tiny little one?  Well, he's so ugly.  He's so ugly, I don't want to see his ass.  I don't want to see his fucking cock.  He should have come suck my 10-inch cock.  Are you cutting him cut?  No, you put one too many...  Because he's a half and half.  You put one too many zeros in.  He's a half and half.  Am I the only one that wants to see the 10-inch cock?  I don't think he's serious.  What?  Do you think it's correct?  I am not a half and half, and stop saying that. 
[03:08:30]  Oh, you're 100% gay?  No!  I'm engaged.  Why are you not married?  Dumb son of a...  Why are you not married?  Why are you not married?  In July of 2010, I'm getting married.  Oh, big dad.  Listen, I'm grandfather.  I have three grandkids.  I'm married 35 years.  Otherwise, I'll be like you ugly piece of garbage.  Ah, Jujabroni.  Hey, a lot of people say I look like...  Ever watch ER?  Yeah. 
[03:09:00]  Anthony Edwards?  Yeah.  Dr. Mark Green?  People say I look like him a little bit.  Well, you know, I mean, it is a big deal.  He was stunned by a baby.  Whatever.  Sheik, what are you going to do the next time you catch Ultimate Warrior by himself?  What are you going to do?  That's a good question.  I tell him, I'll beat him his prime time, and I still can't kick his fucking faggot ass  any time he want to challenge with me.  And then he said, no, Sheik, I don't want to challenge with you.  I said, you don't have a fucking balls till you come challenge with me. 
[03:09:30]  I'll beat you in your prime time in our front of Georgia, and I still can't fucking suplex you  and put you in the camel clutch, break your back, and fuck your ass.  That makes you humble.  Humble.  Humble.  I want to see the...  That would make me a little humble.  I want to see the...  I want to see the...  I want to see the...  Exactly.  I'll make him humble any time he wants.  Can you do your finishing move for somebody today?  What?  Sam, let him put you in the camel clutch.  What about...  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[03:10:00]  I hope he wants to see it.  Yeah, let's see it.  Oh, if he wants to see it.  Move this away.  But I'm not going to hurt him because he's a good man.  Come here.  I'll just show him how he puts the camel clutch.  Come here.  Come here.  No, no, no, no, no.  I don't want to put him in the camel.  There you go.  Come here.  For the TV.  Hold on.  Get on your knees.  Turn around.  Get on your knees.  And I fucked your ass.  Get on your knees.  And make you humble.  Okay.  Yeah, fuck him in the ass.  Turn on your knees.  Look at the camera that way.  Right.  Shit.  All right.  Wait.  Let him get up.  Okay.  Okay.  Now.  Come out of here.  Come out of here.  Come out of here. 
[03:10:30]  Now someone take a picture.  Zoom it, cameraman.  Come on.  Wow.  Yeah.  All right.  Ow.  I think you heard him.  Poor little Sam.  Did it hurt?  Yeah.  So elegant.  Oh, shit.  Did it hurt?  Yeah.  I'm busy.  Fuck it today.  I'm busy.  Does he feel strong?  Everybody in the Madison City Garden with my young name is a camel crotch.  Elke Lugan Hogan.  That son of a bitch.  Doesn't sound like camel crotch.  Hey, uh.  Where am I?  I won't hang on the head.  By the way, I have a good friend here. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah?  Who?  And he is one of the beautiful person, Mr. Sean Olivia.  And he makes my roast very, very nice, gentlemen.  Oh.  Sean from Kayfabe Commentaries at kayfabecommentaries.com.  Great video production.  The Iron Sheik Roast and a bunch of other great video videos.  What is the Iron Sheik Roast?  Yeah, what is that about, Iron Sheik?  That gentleman asking me to tell you.  Sean, please.  Who was somebody to get?  This is a classic.  Get on the microphone.  Come sit on.  This is so classic. 
[03:11:30]  I'll fuck you with my 10-inch cock.  I know.  I'll set it up for you, baby.  Yes, sir, Anthony.  Hi, guys.  How are you?  Hey, Iron Sheik.  Hold on one second.  This guy over here said that you don't have a 10-inch cock.  I just want to let you know that.  If you want to show him, I'll show him in the private room.  This is a private room.  Yeah, right here.  This guy right here says you don't have a 10-inch cock.  That's what I say.  If you want it, you have to put the...  You're right.  You're going to have to go in the private room.  Yeah, I'll take him in the private room, and only I'll show him. 
[03:12:00]  He can't believe it.  All right.  How are we going to get this done?  Well, if you want it, I can do it right away here or anywhere.  I say right away here.  Well, close the curtains.  Iraq doesn't believe you have a 10-inch cock.  I don't know why.  I don't think we want to do that.  Why?  It's not we.  The Jews always fuck things up.  Yeah, no kidding.  If you don't want to do it, are you going to fire me?  You want to see about his 10-inch cock by...  No, see, there's 10-inch cock that's on the DVD.  There's another DVD on the market.  This is the entertainment business right here. 
[03:12:30]  The world's colliding.  How many times do Iron Sheik and the New Jack?  Guys, they don't give a fuck.  They give them booze and all this shit.  Now we got a new DVD.  Exactly.  All right, show you rock the 10-inch cock, Iron Sheik.  He's a Hulk Hogan fan, too, for real.  Is he ready?  You want a show here?  Yes.  You don't mind?  Yes or no?  I don't care.  Ah, guys.  Ah, what's the hell?  Just a bunch of guys.  Really?  Yeah, it's a Thursday.  But maybe next time, if he's okay.  Maybe next time.  No!  No!  Maybe next time.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Show him now!  We got to leave something to the imagination. 
[03:13:00]  Show him now!  Show him now!  We got to leave something to the imagination.  Show him now!  Show him now!  All right, show us half now and half next time.  Show him now!  You want to show him a look?  Yes!  Show him now!  He's got to see his 10-inch cock.  He's only leaking.  E-Rock, get over there and take a look at the 10-inch cock.  I don't think the sheik is lying.  Wait a second.  What is E-Rock going to do for Iron Sheik to show his 10-inch cock?  I'll tell you what he'll do.  He'll re-book him here again.  He'll plug the DVD for an entire week straight. 
[03:13:30]  Oh, shit.  That's good.  No, we have to do something else.  What do you want?  I don't know.  What's better than plugging the DVD?  Well, that's great.  Well, we could put some fingers in his poop hole.  I don't think he'd enjoy that.  He could do it for a whole week.  It's no wonder you're in the wrestling entertainment business, Eric.  Your other guy at Iron Sheik wants you to show E-Rock the 10-inch cock.  Is there a light over there?  I can't even see it.  If you said, okay, I'll show you.  Otherwise, show the cock!  Show the cock!  Show the cock!  Show the cock!  Push this back. 
[03:14:00]  Push it back for the Sheik.  Push it back for the Iron Sheik.  E-Rock, you owe us.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, he's taking his clothes off.  Look at that Tony Montana shirt he's got on.  Oh, he's going to show E-Rock the 10-inch cock.  He's on 7-inch.  You owe us to that cock!  You owe us to that cock!  Holy shit!  Where is it?  E-Rock, he's shaking the ball bag out.  He's shaking the balls.  That's what he was saying.  What a set of balls on the sheet.  That was all balls!  What was that? 
[03:14:30]  It was all balls.  It was all balls.  It was like an acorn.  What a set of 10-inch cock.  All right, so now we've got a rick full of plugs.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Iron Sheik is a grower, not a shower.  I'd say E-Rock will cut together a promo for that thing.  We play it every day.  Wait.  E-Rock, what was it?  I see that correctly.  Well, let's ask E-Rock.  E-Rock, was it a 10-inch cock?  He might be the grower, not the shower type, but it was all bag.  It was all bag, Iron Sheik. 
[03:15:00]  All bag.  Maybe he was storing his cock in his bag.  I would put that bag in your mouth.  E-Rock, E-Rock!  I'll talk for you.  It's all right.  How do we get the Iron Sheik roast?  It's available on DVD at the ringroast.com.  Ringroast.com.  Ringroast.com.  What comedians were on it?  What personality?  Bob Levy was on that, wasn't he?  No, no, no.  They backed out.  Pressure from the other show or something.  Who was on this?  Jameson?  Don Jameson. 
[03:15:30]  Don Jameson.  Mike Morse.  Who's the other one?  Wow.  Jimmy Graham and Ryan Marr.  We played a few clips, I think, late last week or early this week.  It was good.  We liked what we heard.  And there was some kind of an incident where somebody got mad about an Owen Hart joke?  There was like some shit that happened.  Yeah, Scott Hall came in drunk to the roast, and the comedian did an off-color thing.  But, you know, on a roast, anything goes.  Yeah, of course.  And, of course, he took it and almost beat the shit out of Jimmy Graham.  Wow.  I'm sure you've toured or know Jimmy Graham on the comedy circuit. 
[03:16:00]  Sure.  Yeah.  And it was a scary situation until the security guys got it.  Fuck yeah, man.  Who's Jimmy Graham?  This is actually cool.  It's a special two-  From Philly?  Round Boy Jimmy Graham.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know who he is.  All right.  What's the plug again?  Ringroast.com.  Ringroast.com.  www.ringroast.com.  All right.  Iron Sheik, you all right?  So far, I'm great.  Like I said, from Tehran, Iran, to Madison City Garden.  Hey, you have any friends in Iraq?  I'm not Iraqian.  I'm Iranian. 
[03:16:30]  I know.  I'm saying how do you feel about the Iranians?  I know.  Jesus Christ.  I'm trying to get him going.  What the fuck?  Yeah, I'm Iranian.  I know that I can.  I know you don't want to do an interview.  Sorry, Bill.  Didn't you see what I was doing?  I kept bringing up the ultimate warrior.  I know.  I knew what you were going for.  I knew what you were going for.  Are you guys doing the virus tour this summer?  No.  No virus tour this summer?  No.  Fuck that.  No.  Because then our faggots do not want us to do it.  Fag cocksuckers.  I tell you, the Iron Sheik would be great for the virus tour. 
[03:17:00]  Well, we might.  If you're going on.  We might figure something out for later in the summer.  But, Bill, what were you saying to the Iron Sheik?  Let's go back to Bill Burr.  I was just asking about how you feel about Iraqis.  Yeah, that's a good question.  I'll be honest with you.  I grew up in a sport, not a politician.  Iraqi is next to Iranian, like black in this country, next to white men.  So I'm not against a politician.  I grew up in a sport and no politician. 
[03:17:30]  But in seven years, in between Iraq and Iran, big war.  And the devil was Saddam Hussein, bad president.  And then a lot of Muslim people over there in Baghdad and Iraq.  I'll be honest with you.  I don't like war.  I grew up with a sport, not politician.  Not too much common about the war in between Iraq, Iran.  Well, let me make a difference.  Who else do you hate?  Who else do you hate? 
[03:18:00]  Arthur Moore.  That's it?  That's the one?  That's the one?  Randy Savage?  No.  No, Randy Savage?  No, I don't hate him.  Bobby Kelly?  Only one person.  Only person.  I don't give a fuck.  What about Brian Blair?  Is there?  How about Brian Blair?  Just a minute.  They're asking me, not you.  God, he's got a chop.  I give him all the time.  Give him a chop.  Give him a chop.  Keep your fucking mouth shut.  You are not yours.  Yeah, why didn't he interrupt you?  No, you should talk.  Exactly. 
[03:18:30]  Are you the only chick or I'm not fucking the only chick?  I'm done now.  You can talk.  You're not half enough anyway.  You're gay yourself?  No, man.  No, you are.  Who want to fuck your fucking stinky ass anyway?  How about my fiance?  Thank you.  Big fucking man.  She's strapping it off for you.  Forty years old.  Never had a girlfriend.  The people tell me, shek, Eric, have to be Jew jabroni, sheep, or he have to be gay.  Forty years old.  And he's both.  And he's both, yeah.  Never married.  Never had a wife. 
[03:19:00]  No, I have a son.  I'm a grandfather.  I'm a family man.  I've been married.  35 years.  The best she left me now after, 35, she was a gold digger.  But no problem.  How about you, Eric?  How many times do you have?  I have no kids.  Okay.  I've been in a relationship for eight years.  I'm getting married next summer.  And I got some great nieces.  How old are you?  40 years old.  How much money do you make a year?  Enough.  Not enough.  Enough.  Oh, good shit. 
[03:19:30]  You know, you are not a shit class.  You try to put yourself over.  I make you till you be over.  Like I say, Mr. Sean Olivia did the best job for that.  How is she gross?  Not you.  Look how nice he's dressed and everything in a suit.  Exactly.  You look like a slob.  You look like a slob.  I'm in.  Tell him.  Look at him.  I'm not a slob.  That man represents you.  I'm not a slob guy guy.  He should be dressed representing a gentleman like you.  He should be dressed like that. 
[03:20:00]  I love you.  You said that.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Sheik.  The suit's in the cleaners.  Yes.  The suit's in the cleaners.  Oh, he's full of shit.  Oh, big sir.  He's full of shit.  Exactly.  40 years old.  I never had a girlfriend.  Never married.  And a boy still be Sheik.  He have to be cheap, son of a bitch.  Or he have to be gay.  How many cocks in his mouth?  Oh, imagine many.  Imagine.  Why don't you fire him, Iron Sheik?  Why don't you fire his ass?  Fire his ass.  Really, I should. 
[03:20:30]  But now, you know, I'm 67 years.  And I'm a grandfather.  I'm happy.  I have that jabroni better than nothing.  Yeah.  Better than nothing.  Exactly.  Did it feel good to slap him?  Oh, he deserved it.  He deserved it to slap him.  Did you?  Because, like you said, Ottoman royal is a fucking fact.  He shouldn't come to the Sheik.  You don't take the legend.  Yeah, yeah.  He's David.  If he wanted to go over to the Sheik, that's one thing.  But you don't take the Sheik over to him.  That's disrespectful. 
[03:21:00]  I love you.  Take a sip.  Disrespect.  This gentleman should be my agent.  Speaking of the Iron Sheik roast, there was a big incident that happened on the Iron Sheik roast.  The confrontation between you and Brian Blair.  But I fucked Brian Blair so long his ass gets big, like your ass.  But, no.  He's obsessed with gay stuff.  I know.  Well, he's a family man.  I love you.  Exactly.  You know, something happened where you slapped him at the end of the roast.  I mean, he didn't give you the proper respect. 
[03:21:30]  Because of you, you take me to his table.  No, no, no.  Brian Blair.  You shouldn't come to my table.  We're talking the roast of Brian Blair, not the ultimate warrior now.  But I'm going to say, Brony, the only person, Anthony, Opie, the only person is in my target,  that son of a bitch, Scott Hall.  Scott Hall.  Oh.  Tell him who's Scott Hall.  Scott Hall from the Outsiders.  Sure, sure.  The NWO, Scott Hall.  Yeah, Razor Ramon.  Razor Ramon, exactly.  Razor Ramon, exactly.  Yeah. 
[03:22:00]  So, anyway, I want to say hello to all my intelligent radio station fans, Opie and Anthony.  And I want to say thanks to them.  Jesus or Muhammad or Allah to have come to the most famous city in the world.  Like Fred Sinatra said, the city never sleeps.  The city is up all the time.  Manhattan, Madison City, New York, and especially Opie and Anthony, radio station, and Howard the Storm fans. 
[03:22:30]  I love all my wrestling fans.  And I love all radio station people wrestling.  Anthony and Opie.  Thank you, Iron Sheik.  Wow.  That's an amazing promo right there.  Thank you, sir.  Where do you live, Sheik?  I live in Olympic City, or your country, Atlanta, Georgia.  Oh, okay.  Oh, that's nice down there. 
[03:23:00]  Yeah, Mr. Ted Turner takes me to Georgia because I live in the faithful Georgia.  Last week, for the first time in my life, I'm in hospital.  Doctor checks my heart.  Tuksure checks my body.  This is Sheik.  You are still in excellent shape.  You don't have to stay here no more than one night.  You are in perfect shape to compare your age.  And then hospital, doctor, all nurses in the state of Georgia, they're nice to me. 
[03:23:30]  They teach me in first class, God bless, from my doctor, Dr. Colin, to the all nurses, everybody.  They was good people.  Did you see the movie The Wrestler?  Good question.  Okay.  I never saw, no.  I didn't saw.  Because I don't give a fuck.  Because I was a real wrestler. 
[03:24:00]  They should have been on that movie.  Not that fucking, fucking that government was Islam, you tell him.  Ernest Miller?  Yeah, Ernest Miller is black.  In Iran, we don't have black.  Or white people.  Unless I'm getting my ticket.  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Hey, hey, hey.  And you also don't have gay people in Iran?  Oh, we have that one.  But we don't have black people.  No, according to your president, there's no gay people in Iran.  Ahmadinejad said, no, no, gay people were in Iran. 
[03:24:30]  No, Mr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, president of Iran, like I say, he's very religious man.  Most people, most population, Muslim, we have a gay in Iran.  But certain area, not all of them.  You want Iran to have nuclear weapons?  Well, like I say, I grew up with a sport, not politician.  No comment.  No comment.  Wow.  Okay.  What about pussy? 
[03:25:00]  Oh, I get pussy everywhere I go.  You get some of the finest pussy in the world?  Better I go big gay in a gardener or more or any sense my edges.  Yeah.  You know, I mean.  Could you do a pussy promo for us?  That's how he curls that mustache.  Do a wrestling promo, but talk about pussy.  Pussy, I'll be honest with you.  If it's a good blue eyes, good blonde, I'd like to eat the pussy of the blue eyes and blonde.  Otherwise, I'll fuck her ass.  Now your grandchildren. 
[03:25:30]  If she has brown hair, you fuck her ass.  That might have been the greatest quote ever.  I'll just say.  It might have been.  I have a woman all over the world.  I'm not crazy about woman.  I'm crazy about good friend.  Your country, greatest country on earth.  Two things are hard to find.  Good man.  Good woman.  Good friend.  Besides that, United States, number one in the world from A to the C.  If you cannot make it New York, you don't make it nowhere. 
[03:26:00]  Like Frank Sinatra said, the city never sleeps.  You cannot make it New York, you don't make it nowhere.  God bless Frank Sinatra, my Italian person.  He used to come watch my match in the garden.  And he was the real, real singer and hot class and part of the mafia.  God bless you.  And you know who made it in New York?  Iron Sheik.  That's where he made it. 
[03:26:30]  Right there at the Madison Square Garden.  I don't have to say.  I made it from Middle East come to the greatest wrestling country in the world.  Match of the arena, Madison Square Garden, New York.  Single champion, taxing champion, battle run from WrestleMania number one to the WrestleMania 20.  Well, sir, you did WrestleMania 17.  It was the last one you were in.  Oh, 17?  That's a long time ago.  Why doesn't Vince have you come back? 
[03:27:00]  Because I made the WWE billion, billion dollars my young day.  But now they want to write a book about me.  They canceled my book because the thing I snore coke, the thing I smoke opium, the thing I snore opium, best sashish, best opium we have.  The WWE has this new PG image, and Iron Sheik's book is so controversial, talking about his party days with all the medicine men. 
[03:27:30]  Right.  They're afraid of lawsuits arising from him.  So what did he use to smoke?  Crack?  You smoked a crack?  He's done everything from him to Z.  In other words, he wrote a great book.  I did A to the Z, but recently, I'm broke.  I don't have money.  That son of a bitch only sent for me $20 every month.  What the fuck?  I killed him with $20.  So anyway, I'll be honest with you.  I'm a strong survivor.  And I don't miss my coke anymore. 
[03:28:00]  I don't miss the crack.  I don't miss the blue eyes or blonde.  I've had everything, A to the Z.  Now, God make me strong only to try to stop my bad habit because for my three grandkids.  Ah, there you go.  There you go.  What do you think about Vince McMahon?  You like Vince?  Vince McMahon, I was a horse, and he know.  He cannot run the wagon without horse.  I was the best horse he had.  I make his company billion, billion dollars. 
[03:28:30]  He loved me.  Now, I'm not a good horse.  I'm a handicapped.  I'm 67 years old.  He forgot about me.  He know this.  I'm the real champion before Hulk Hogan.  You're fired.  Exactly.  You're fired.  Right.  Exactly.  Doesn't matter.  Vince Scott didn't fire me, and the people know.  Who was the champion before that Hollywood blonde, jabroni, faggot, Hulk Hogan, Iron Sheik? 
[03:29:00]  Thank you, Anthony.  Thank you, Opie.  Yes, sir.  If you're broke, he looks like he's doing well.  How the fuck could you be broke?  If he's only getting 15 or 20% of your money, he's fucking, he might be taking more than 20%.  I love you.  I'm telling you, he's taking half and half.  That's fucking crazy.  Yeah, exactly.  Tell him, my man.  Fucking insane.  Sean, you have rights.  He's taking half, half, half.  I don't know what he does with your money. 
[03:29:30]  I give it to him.  Oh, shit.  Unbelievable.  Oh, shit.  He's given, see, I'm a Jew, but he's given us a bad name.  Don't give it up.  Because if I was handling you, your 10-inch con, I would only take 15% or 10%, not 50.  God bless you.  That's bullshit.  America runs with intelligent Jew businessmen people.  They are best in the world.  They are smart.  But that shithead, he's not an intelligent Jew.  He's a jabroni Jew. 
[03:30:00]  Yeah.  You should slap him.  He probably took some of your land, too.  I don't want to put him over that much.  I don't want to slap him.  But I prefer to throw the beer mother to his face, but not here.  And then fuck his ass.  But the beer mother.  My cock is too good to go that stinky fat ass.  Oh, can you imagine?  No.  Oh, you got to wash your dick for a week.  He don't want to fuck.  He don't want to kill.  I've been sorry for that dumb son of a bitch. 
[03:30:30]  Ha!  Stop!  Oh, he's spitting on him.  Oh, my God.  Unbelievable.  50 fucking percent.  That's ridiculous.  But don't get me wrong.  Okay.  I love the intelligent Jew businessmen people.  New York runs with the intelligent all Jewish people.  Yeah.  Jewish people, they are my neighbor in Iran.  Very smart people.  In the car seat.  You could say neighbor.  That's one way to say it.  In fact.  You said it perfect.  Yes, sir.  You said it perfect.  Does the Irish chick have a sensitive side? 
[03:31:00]  Sensitive side.  Well, I have sensitive sides.  Yeah, it's springtime.  Bring it down.  Bring it down.  I'm not a school teacher.  I'm arrested.  What does that mean?  Well, like a soft side.  Like a soft side.  Soft side.  Only I have my tennis card.  No, no, no, no.  Enough about the car.  When you hold your grandchild, you feel a warmth.  You feel a warmth.  A happiness.  That's it.  That a Jew can't take from you.  That is.  For God of Jesus.  What's the Jew in the Jews?  I'm a Jew, Decker. 
[03:31:30]  I understand that.  But he's self-hating.  Why are you always stirring the pot here?  I know.  Because it's fucking funny.  He's got a tattoo of a star of David on him.  How fucking ironic is that?  He's always doing something to you.  Relax.  Exactly.  You didn't yell at him.  Why don't you talk about fucking asses?  Yeah, we're not in Sheik's beer.  All right.  Don't be so temperamental.  Hey, Iron Sheik, would you rather fuck Eric in the ass or the fabulous moolah?  Oh, jeez.  One of them doesn't worth the shit.  No.  Moolah.  God bless him.  I don't talk behind the moolah. 
[03:32:00]  She didn't lock my smoke in the car.  I smoke Greg the Hammer myself.  We give the moolah right in the California.  She come in the car and I smoke the marijuana.  Greg smoked the marijuana.  I'm fabulous moolah.  I said, Sheik, I don't lock that shit in the car.  I said, oh, yeah?  You don't lock my marijuana?  Greg, stop the car.  Get the fuck out of the car.  So after that, I tell her, keep your fucking mouth shut or take a hitchhawk to the show. 
[03:32:30]  So I'm done.  But she's an old lady.  Exactly.  Take a hitchhawk to the show.  Bro.  Teach you to disrespect the Sheik, right?  Yeah.  Hell yeah.  She disrespected you.  Exactly.  She didn't want to throw her the fuck out.  I didn't expect that.  Sure, because she didn't lock my marijuana.  Fuck her.  My marijuana is much better than fucking your fat ass or moolah old pussy.  I like young pussy. 
[03:33:00]  Yeah.  So anyway.  Yeah, let's talk about that young pussy again.  Blue eyes, blonde hair, right?  Blue eyes and blonde, my favorite.  Do you like when they shave the hair off?  Oh, even better.  Like a Scandinavian.  German, Swedish, Norwegian.  Yeah.  Olympic game.  I was in Munich, Germany.  Best blue eyes and blonde hair.  You lick a girl's ass, too?  You like to tongue that girl's ass?  Well, it depends.  If it's not stinky, like here, yeah.  Well, of course.  No, clean.  Nice clean.  Oh, I do energy because they call me animal party all night. 
[03:33:30]  As I have my medicine and my marijuana, whatever, a cup of cold German beer, I can have sex all night.  Would you like to fuck...  Because I'm not Michael Jackson.  I'm a man.  Would you like to fuck Hulk's wife in front of him?  What is it?  Would you like to fuck Hulk's wife in front of him?  No, that's something private, family way.  I don't want to get cheap heat, you know.  I respect Hogan and his wife, and then I do this to somebody that wants to do it. 
[03:34:00]  I used to do it in the Miami.  I fuck some woman, husband, watch, or he want it.  That guy did it.  But otherwise, no.  Oh, cuckold?  Yeah, some guy that want to see you fuck his wife?  Yeah, and he watched it.  So I did it before I get married.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's why I did it.  What was he doing?  Was he jerking off?  No, he just see it and enjoy it, and then he watched.  And he can't do nothing.  When I do it, he watched. 
[03:34:30]  And I did it because he won that.  So, but that was before my marriage.  Before my marriage, not after.  Right, right, right.  No, after marriage.  You know, I'm a family man.  I'm a grandfather.  I'm ashamed to talk like that.  But no, I'm almost safe.  No, I'm almost safe.  No one, you know, yeah.  Exactly.  No, I'm almost safe.  It's okay.  And I can, I mean, I'm a good man if I want you.  Of course.  I believe the God, Jesus, and I believe Muhammad.  You're a gentleman, but you don't take any shit. 
[03:35:00]  I'm in.  For sure not.  Yeah.  Hey, Iron.  I'm a man.  I'm not Michael Jackson from Faggot, or I'm not Ultimate War, or I'm not Hulk Hogan.  What's your problem with Michael?  J-Bar Bonson.  What's your problem with Michael Jackson?  Well, he's another billionaire man.  He's like young kids, like Eric.  Eric is a massager.  He gives the young one a massage, and after that, he fucks the young one's ass.  So, that's his gimmick.  That's Eric's gimmick?  Yes, sir.  I don't fuck anybody in the ass.  Yeah, but he's a doctor. 
[03:35:30]  I'll ask him why he gives the people a massage.  I'm a trained massage therapist.  He massaged the young one.  Uh-oh.  Big fucking hell to who?  To the young one?  To the young one?  No, I don't do anything with the young boys.  No, no, no.  Over 10 years, 15 years old?  You gave me a bad reputation that way.  No, no, no, no.  Oh, you don't want to tell me what you're a doctor or you are?  I am not a doctor.  I am just a massage therapist.  How did you become a massage therapist, whatever it is, and go into management?  Where did that translation come from? 
[03:36:00]  I'm a man of multi-talents.  Oh.  All right.  That went somewhere.  I'm very multi-talented.  All right.  Hey, Sheik, what did you think of Sergeant Slaughter?  Great performer from Minnesota.  I break the ball record with him.  I make the company billion, billion dollars.  Oh, they love seeing you guys fight.  The best match I had with the Sergeant Slaughter campus match.  What was it?  Yeah, the boot camp match from Madison Square Garden, yes.  The best. 
[03:36:30]  That was Madison Square Garden.  That's what we talked about today.  It's one of the most famous matches he's ever had.  Oh, he'd come out with the American flag, and you'd come out with the Iranian flag, and  oh, boy, would a shit hit the fan.  Because he was a nation.  He was representing all America.  Yeah.  I'm a red Iranian.  I come with the Ayatollah flag in the ring.  Oh, they didn't like that.  Oh.  I'm lucky nobody shoot me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, he came out with that.  Was that movie based on him, the wrestler?  No, exactly.  The wrestler.  The character was based on him. 
[03:37:00]  I love you.  You suck at partner.  And you didn't get any money for that?  No, sir.  What are you doing?  Because that Eric's job was to issue them.  Oh, look at that.  I'm watching the clip now.  No, no, no.  Oh, look at the Sheik in the ring.  I'm watching a clip from the old days.  Old days.  That's the Sergeant Slaughter.  Sergeant Slaughter.  That's the boot camp match right there.  He's beating the shit out of you, Sheik.  I know, but we had a great match.  Oh, yeah.  I broke the record for the company, and that was the best match we had in the garden. 
[03:37:30]  Look at that 10-inch cock.  When you see a blonde with blue eyes, does your dick go like the tip of your shoes?  Oh, wow.  The people are on their feet.  Yeah.  He came out, man.  That was right after the hostage situation.  Exactly.  Because my gimmick was a national.  I'm going to speak the Farsi, Arabic, soldiers of America.  I told him, he was a bad guy before.  I told him baby face.  When you come out and start singing like that, Iranian national anthem, and people would 
[03:38:00]  throw things at you.  Everything.  Yeah.  Because I speak Farsi.  I'm Iranian.  Soldier is all America.  Very lucky nobody shoot me.  Yeah.  They probably really hated you.  Why?  You know, because my gimmick was a national.  Yeah, yeah.  I speak Farsi, and I'm, again, people over there, 444, there's a whole stage in Iran.  Wah!  I'm lucky I'm with you guys.  And then, yeah, you come over, and, you know, you played it off really well.  Exactly.  With the Ayatollah flag.  Oh, the flag.  Nicole and I did the national anthem.  The national anthem. 
[03:38:30]  Oh, wow.  They hate that.  Exactly.  My gimmick was a shoot, because I'm really Iranian.  Yeah.  You ever get scared, though?  Seriously, when you would, because during that time, Iran was, like, really a country  that we hated.  The only little country fucked with the greatest and strongest country in the world was Iran.  Keep your people over 444 days hostage.  And then President Carter lost the face.  He sent the helicopter over there.  Helicopter fall down. 
[03:39:00]  And then who come back?  Ayatollah Khomeini.  And then Ayatollah Khomeini come back, and he tell the President Carter,  give the Shah back.  They didn't give the Shah back, and then Ayatollah Khomeini is the leader of the Islamic,  and he'll keep the people over.  444 days, to President Reagan come into office, everybody come home.  Reagan scared him.  Exactly.  No, he was doing it as a slap in the face to Carter.  Oh, man.  You said it perfect.  I said it perfect. 
[03:39:30]  Of course you did.  Yes, sir.  Of course you did.  Because, you know, I'm not a schoolteacher.  I grew up in the sport.  George Animal Steel was a schoolteacher, right?  He was a schoolteacher.  Yeah.  And he was an intelligent man.  But his giving was there.  Yeah.  Crazy.  Yeah.  It certainly was.  Turn the pipe called.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Well, did you ever wrestle him?  The Sheik just threw Slaughter out of the ring.  And, you know, Sergeant Slaughter was out in the ring,  and people started throwing stuff at you. 
[03:40:00]  Exactly.  They didn't like you.  That was the most, that was the best match in the garden.  It's like he threw America out of the ring.  Exactly.  Sure, sure.  That's it, Bill.  Look at those fucking traps.  Iron Sheik's a big guy.  Jesus.  Fucking traps.  An animal.  Hey, Iron Sheik, they're saying that the wrestler was based on Jake the Snake Roberts,  and not yourself, my friend.  Jake the Snake is a rubber.  He's not one of my little fingers compared to Mr. Bob Buckley.  Look, compared to Slaughter.  Look at that match. 
[03:40:30]  That was the best match in the WWE history, or WWE.  That's a good one.  Do you get mad when people call wrestling just, like, rough ballet?  Do you get mad at that?  Who calls it that?  Who calls it what?  Well, Rich does.  Rough ballet.  Rough ballet?  Rich thinks that wrestling's fake, Iron Sheik, and he thinks that it's just, you know, it's a joke.  A lot of people think wrestling is fake.  This guy, right here, right here.  Talk to him.  But wrestling, if we come in the ring, we beat the fuck out of him, and then he believes wrestling is real. 
[03:41:00]  Yeah.  Certain people know 90% real, 10% entertainment, because the champion making most of the money.  And if you are good, if you are tough, Mr. McMinn is not going to tell you to lose the match.  You say no.  If he can beat me, he can beat me.  Otherwise, how much do I get?  Because my business, money talk, money walk.  Money talk, money walk?  I never heard it that way before.  Bullshit, but, you know, the bullshit walk. 
[03:41:30]  Yeah, sure.  Exactly.  Why didn't Vince bring you back to, like, announce a match or something like that?  Why didn't he bring you back?  I'll be honest with you.  I had my run.  I make my money.  Now I'm 67 years old, a handicap.  I don't complete.  I don't block.  I had, I had, I see A to the Z, and now I'm happy.  Yeah, you had a, you know, a great run.  I had a, I've been around the world, I've been around the world 10 times.  I was a millionaire before.  Also, I'm not poor right now.  What did you think of the last wave of big wrestlers? 
[03:42:00]  It's going back a little bit, but like The Rock, Mankind, did you like them?  Like I said, I live it to my wrestling fans.  My wrestling fans, they like the old timer for some reason, better than new generation.  Like I said, like the old timer movie star, John Wayne, and then Kurt Douglas, Michael Douglas,  his son, it's not like father, father was great.  Same as for wrestlers.  They like the old timer, better than new generation. 
[03:42:30]  Kurt Douglas was better than Mike Douglas, right?  100%.  Yeah.  No compression.  Straight to San Francisco.  Why was the show in San Francisco?  What kind of show?  I'll tell you why.  I'll tell you why.  Exactly.  Sorry.  I was trying to lob it over the net.  Iron Sheik's switching to Budweiser.  He's not a single beer kind of guy.  Exactly.  He went through the six pack in 45 minutes.  I'm not fussy.  For real.  I like American beer, but why is it? 
[03:43:00]  And also, I like the German beer, Bax.  Well, we ran out of Bax.  Well, what's your favorite beer?  Molson Ice, right?  A Canadian Molson Ice.  Oh, that shit will fuck you up.  Exactly.  Because it's the strongest.  Six points.  Yes.  And a half or seven points.  I went up to Canada.  Exactly.  I went up to Canada once and drank some of that just thinking I was drinking beer.  And after a couple of them, I was feeling like, ooh. 
[03:43:30]  That's it.  But nice and smooth.  Yeah.  It doesn't make you get a big belly beer like him.  He don't drink beer.  Look at his guts.  Oh, my God.  What's the matter with him?  But if you did crack and you quit, and you quit crack, because you couldn't have been a  good crack addict if you still had that belt.  I mean, that's worth at least 10 vials.  I didn't say I didn't do the crack.  I did the crack.  I did opium.  I did hashish.  I did Iranian marijuana. 
[03:44:00]  I'm a Turkish hashish.  Iranian marijuana.  But moderation was my key.  Opium hash.  Remember that stuff?  Just a little bit of crack.  A little bit of crack.  I love crack.  Don't get me wrong.  If I can't afford it, I cannot afford it, I'll quit.  I hear you.  Iron.  Wow.  What a powerhouse.  Yeah.  Oh, you got it already?  Age is enough.  Jimmy's got it.  Yeah.  Let me explain it to me.  I had a party all my life, Paris.  I do my marijuana.  I use a snore powder or a snore coke. 
[03:44:30]  I get more energy.  Yeah.  I'm a more hyper.  I train in three days.  That's what it'll do.  I train in three days without a stop.  No sleep.  Oh, my God.  Honest to God.  Three nights, three days.  As long as I have my good medicine.  That's crazy.  That's a bender.  They cannot handle it.  After a couple of cold beer, after a little bit hard, a little bit soft, they're gone.  But I'm absolutely proud.  Hey, did you watch, did you watch the Hogan's reality show? 
[03:45:00]  Did you like that show or did you think it was just all crap?  I used to watch it a little bit, but the end, it was nothing good.  A lot of the divorce, the wife, these, that.  Hulk Hogan can be a nice guy or he can be the phoniest, phoniest faggot in the world.  Iron, I'm going to go serious for a moment.  I heard, and I'm not goofing on this, that you got really sad talking about Chris Benoit.  I'll be honest with you, I saw him last time, Pennsylvania, and he come to me, he said, 
[03:45:30]  Shiki Baba, I live in Fayetteville, Georgia.  I said, I live in Fayetteville, Georgia, 45 years.  And he said, I'm alone, and I miss a friend, come see me.  I said, no problem, that was the last time I see Chris Benoit.  He's a Canadian, I'm Iranian, or American, whatever. 
[03:46:00]  So, but Chris Benoit killed himself one thing, but he killed his baby, seven years old,  give the baby, shot a dagger, and you kill the baby, kill his wife, I don't think he did a good thing.  No, no, that's not a really good thing.  Do you know what I'm right?  Yeah, very bad, very bad, yes.  God bless you.  I think we could all look at that and say it was bad.  Yeah.  That was very bad.  The man, if he had the balls, he wouldn't kill himself one thing. 
[03:46:30]  But if he killed the little baby, seven years old.  That's crazy.  That's a little bit cheap heat.  Because that's a cheap heat.  See, I'll get my head in the ring before I do anything foolish.  I know it's still the show.  But Chris Benoit, young man, little guy, he want to be a big guy, like I'm a Sikh, he didn't make it.  Right.  I hear you.  Yeah.  Wow.  More Sergeant Slaughter in there.  Wow.  We were just watching clips and then Iron Sheik. 
[03:47:00]  Amazing.  I clicked on the wrong one.  What a day.  What a day.  What a day.  Exactly.  What a day.  What a day.  What a day.  What a day.  Exactly.  Fantastic day.  And we're promoting the roast.  Yes.  What's the roast again there, Eric?  God bless you guys.  Do your fucking job, Eric.  I got all the plugs here.  The Iron Sheik roast available on DVD at ringroast.com, www.ringroast.com.  And this weekend, May 1st, Friday night, the Iron Sheik will be making a special guest  appearance at the FCW Wrestling Show at the Brooklyn Masonic Temple, 6 p.m., 317 Claremont 
[03:47:30]  Avenue, Brooklyn, New York.  And this Saturday night, the Iron Sheik returns to the National Wrestling Superstars at the  Elks Lodge on Hooper Avenue in Brick, New Jersey.  And finally, if you want to book the Iron Sheik for any type of appearance, contact ESS Promotions  at ESS Promotions.com.  Very good.  And that ain't no BS.  It's ESS.  And like I say again, I want to say hello to all my intelligent. 
[03:48:00]  Yes.  Opie and Anthony Show, Howard and Store, 101 News.  And I want to say, everywhere I go in the America, people tell me, Sheik, you are on  the Killer Comedian, the best.  You are on the Howard and Store TV show, you are the best.  I think it's a great feeling for me.  To anywhere I go, people talk about it.  God bless all my wrestling fans, Killer Comedian fans, and Howard and Store fans, and also 
[03:48:30]  Anthony and Opie, Opie and Anthony Radio Station.  God bless you guys, I'm not going to talk no more, and have a good day.  Iron Sheik, everyone.  Iron Sheik, there he is.  Go for the big out, Iron.  Go for the big out.  The Sheik.  Big out.  Amazing.  What a day.  Yeah, what a day is right.  This is fantastic.  We have to plug everybody, too.  We have...  Yeah, let's go around the table. 
[03:49:00]  You know, I was at the...  the virus showdown in Camden when you came back from that show.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was great.  Thank you.  Bill Burrell will be at Caroline's tonight through Sunday, 2-1-2-7-5-7-4-100.  Voss is at Comics just tomorrow and Saturday.  Friday, Saturday.  Friday, Saturday only.  And I have no plugs.  I'm on Letterman tomorrow night.  That's a plug.  Oh, hold on.  I got one more plug.  What do you got?  My new CD's coming out next week. 
[03:49:30]  What's it called?  Live in Philly.  Okay.  Where is it from?  Love, baby.  Hold that.  Live in Philly.  Live in Philly.  Iron Sheik getting ready to leave the studio.  I want a picture with the Iron Sheik.  I got to get one, too.  Pleasure.  Go out of the hallway.  Pleasure for me.  I'll take the picture with you.  Yeah, can you go in the hall and start the picture taken?  Yeah.  Start the picture taken.  I want a picture with that guy for putting up with this.  Maybe get him to cut a promo.  Get him to cut a quick promo for us.  If we can do that, then he has to be like...  I'm going to come... 
[03:50:00]  Thank you very much.  What?  Why?  What's following you?  Thank you.  He's just a...  Oh, shit.  It has to be said that the Iron Sheik peed his pants.  Yeah.  In the interview.  Load the boots.  He had probably eight beers in less than an hour.  And there's a huge...  Are you guys clear yet?  No, not clear.  We're talking still.  And there's a huge wet spot in the front of his pants. 
[03:50:30]  And he's putting his coat on.  And I'm sending this picture out to all my followers on Twitter, OP Radio.  It's an amazing wet spot in the front of his pants because he had eight beers in less than an hour.  And he's making believe he's doing something because he doesn't want to shake the Iron Sheik's hand.  Why don't you want to shake the Iron Sheik's hand?  He's a mere ten feet from us.  Because he pissed himself all over himself. 
[03:51:00]  And I think it went on this.  I think it's all over the couch.  Dude, did you see this spot getting bigger and bigger?  Yes.  Where's my cat?  You have a bet?  Iron Sheik is not leaving the studio.  You guys got a great picture if you're following me on Twitter.  OP Radio on Twitter.  And the door is closed.  All right.  It's clear.  Get over there. 
[03:51:30]  Get over there.  Let me get back over here.  Dude, I swear to you, I thought it was a shadow of the microphone at first.  Right.  Because I thought it was the mic bulb.  Sure.  And the light right above.  Yeah, with a lot of lights in here.  So I'm looking.  But at first, I'm going, oh, shit.  I think the Sheik pissed his pants.  And then Ira comes up and goes, the Sheik pissed himself.  And I go, wait a minute.  I thought that was a shadow.  He goes, no, look.  It's getting bigger.  And the wet spot in front of his pants was getting bigger and bigger.  Dude, he just pissed himself.  He pissed all over himself. 
[03:52:00]  And now the room smells like piss.  Did you notice that, too?  The whole room smells like piss.  And then the fucking, the couch is wet.  Dude, the Iron Sheik pissed in our studio.  He pissed his pants.  Which makes it officially the best guest appearance ever.  Ever.  On the Opie and Anthony show.  Ever.  I think that is the biggest, best guest appearance ever.  Ending with a pissing of the pants.  Bill, take a seat.  Bill Burr. 
[03:52:30]  Do you know what we're talking about?  Do you know what we're talking about?  Do you notice anything about the Iron Sheik?  Do you notice what happened there at the end?  Oh, that he had a bladder problem?  Yeah, there was a little.  Dude, you know, it's like the guy fucking, I'd get tossed around one day like that.  I'd shit myself.  Yeah, but.  Yeah, but.  Jesus Christ.  Maybe he's going to lay it off to eight beers in ten minutes.  First of all.  How many beers did he have for real?  Did you see it?  In defense of us, we're all wearing jeans.  The man has on slacks.  There's no secrets when there's slacks. 
[03:53:00]  I saw it.  I saw it.  It started growing.  I saw it as a drop.  And then I saw it manifest.  It started growing.  Into a puddle.  It started growing like the swine flu map that we're seeing.  I thought it was like spilling his beer on it.  But you notice when he talked, like his whole diaphragm.  Jimmy has the best picture ever.  Was it sweat?  Look at Jimmy's picture.  Look at Jimmy's picture.  Oh, my God.  The poor son of a bitch.  Hold on.  The poor son of a bitch. 
[03:53:30]  Oh, my God.  I can't make fun of the eyes.  Wait.  I got to get my picture.  You guys continue.  No, dude.  You guys.  He wants a picture of both of you.  I can't.  I can't.  I have stuff to do.  Rich, talk about it.  Oh, God damn it.  Rich Foster showed me a picture of his shit.  I did that.  Oh, Jesus.  You guys are weird, man.  You're just fucking weird people.  What?  What?  You guys.  I never showed one shit picture in my life, Billy.  Listen, the thing, you know what?  I know, but you look at it like it's the latest Sports Illustrated.  You're a weird person, Anthony.  He shoved it in my face. 
[03:54:00]  That character.  You said that perfectly.  That character in The Wrestler.  You see The Wrestler?  Yes, I did.  The end character was based on him.  The guy that walked in with the flag.  Yeah.  Not the blonde, obviously.  It's kind of the, you know what it is, though?  It's kind of like Requiem for Heavyweight kind of a thing.  You know, it's every wrestler that went through that.  The Iron Sheik wants to know why you don't want to have a picture.  I have great pictures.  We'll talk for a minute.  With The Sheik.  He's coming back in.  He's coming back in.  Yeah, he wants a picture.  The Iron Sheik.  Oh, come on.  He wants a picture.  Shake his hand, too.  He wants a picture. 
[03:54:30]  He wants a picture.  The Iron Sheik.  Look, come on.  The Iron Sheik.  Picture with The Iron Sheik, Dan.  Iron Sheik.  Opie.  He wants a picture with The Iron Sheik.  Opie, you got to get on that group picture.  Oh, he's got his hand right in.  Oh, my God.  Opie, you got to get in on this.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Let's get in.  I'm pretty quick to see everybody.  The Sheik.  All right.  All right.  All right.  One more.  One more. 
[03:55:00]  Opie, one more.  It's turning.  Hey.  I don't like you.  I don't take pictures with you.  It's turning into a fucking photo shoot.  All right.  Come on.  Let's go.  Anthony and the Opie.  All right.  Opie's actually on the side where The Iron Sheik grabbed his dick with that hand.  Opie, it's right on the back of the manager's neck.  One more.  I want to move it.  Yeah. 
[03:55:30]  Yeah.  All right.  That shit, he's just pointing to the wet spot on The Sheik's urine-soaked slacks.  Yes.  All right.  I'll see you on the back.  Take you up here.  Anthony's English.  All right.  God bless you.  God bless you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Rich Voss.  Rich Voss.com.  Thank you.  I'll see you, buddy.  Good for you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  There goes The Iron Sheik.  Fire your manager.  Rich, you know he grabbed his dick with that hand.  You can shook his head.  That's okay.  I probably would have grabbed it myself.  He's famous.  What else? 
[03:56:00]  Wait till you.  Wait till I grab Sammy Koufax.  All right.  We'll wrap him up.  He's great.  How do you not like that guy?  Did he grab it with that hip?  Yeah.  I totally, I totally, like, he went to shake my hand.  I just patted him on the back with both of my hands.  Oh, my God.  I just shook his hand.  You shook his hand.  That's that hand he grabbed.  He's leaking.  He's leaking.  You're pointing at him.  I'll picture.  Dude, you're pointing.  These pictures are. 
[03:56:30]  They're so cruel.  You've got to see these pictures.  You've got to see.  Send me that one immediately.  That has to be blown up.  I got a picture of me, Jimmy, and Ant.  That's a hanger in the studio.  Yeah, that poster.  That's a hanger in the studio.  It's me, Jimmy, and Ant, and we're posing with the Iron Sheik, and I'm, like, pointing  at the camera, and then pointing at the stain.  At a piss stain.  The fucking, the size.  I think, I think, didn't.  Who's Nick?  From the New York Jets.  Nick from the Jets.  Nick Mangold.  Whoa, Nick. 
[03:57:00]  Hey, yeah, that's.  I know you.  There you go.  No, go ahead.  Don't sit anywhere.  Yes, sir.  Yeah, don't.  Are you a wrestling fan?  A little bit.  Do you remember, like, old school wrestlers, like Iron Sheik?  I saw him leave.  You recognize him, though?  Yeah.  He just pissed his pants all over the studio, so I don't touch anything.  Did someone give a microphone for our new guest?  When we were taking the picture, and he went, number one.  I was like, yeah, number one.  That's exactly what, that's exactly what, you're like, mail me that picture immediately. 
[03:57:30]  I got to get that up on Twitter.  What a fucking stain.  On the old Twitter.  Wow.  That was so uncomfortable to look at.  Dude, it really was.  The stain was growing as the interview continued.  You saw the way he was yelling.  His diaphragm was like, he really, he yells from his nuts.  Yeah, he put a little too much energy into his.  Was that sweat pouring down into his?  Too much beer.  No, no.  Or was he leaking?  Look at that.  He went.  Oh, Jesus, man.  And that 10-inch cock was only, he kept saying he had a 10-inch cock, but it was only about an inch.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it was a little, yeah. 
[03:58:00]  This is Nick Mangold from the Jets, by the way.  What position do you play?  I haven't thought about it.  Center.  Oh, cool.  Yeah, and we like making friends with the centers.  We're good friends with, well, still are.  Tyson Walter, who's now retired, but played for a bunch of teams.  And yeah, Nick, are you really a fan of the show, or you just said that just to come in  and say hi?  No, no.  No, because some people go, I'm a big fan.  Then you start talking to them, and they're like, they don't know who the fuck we are.  No, no.  I've heard, unfortunately, I don't have time for the radio. 
[03:58:30]  I get six minutes in in the morning, and I get six minutes on the way home.  So I've missed out on a lot.  So E-Rock lied to us.  That's fine.  Where are you from?  I didn't do it.  I'd like the radio to see.  E-Rock goes, he's a big fan.  I'll read what he wrote.  Nick Mangold is a big, not just a fan, a big O&A fan.  He wants to stop by and say hello.  You could have a note that just says, E-Rock is big.  Technically, I am big.  That's all right.  Yeah, see?  And he does enjoy things.  That would make you a big fan.  Maybe us telling you that the Iron Sheep peed his pants, maybe you become a fan now. 
[03:59:00]  Who knows?  You never know.  If I know this is going on daily occurrences, I might have to start chipping.  Why don't you ask the gentleman who told me that this is a fan.  Oh, Steve.  He's passing the buck now.  He's passing the buck.  Steve, what happened?  Don't get me wrong.  We like having you in.  Believe me.  Look how small Steve looks now.  What happened?  That's unbelievable.  Look at that.  I know.  Steve.  Steve, what happened?  Yeah, wow.  I thought he was a fan.  That's exactly what was pitched to me by the head of sports.  He makes Steve look small. 
[03:59:30]  Do centers get a lot of pussy, like quarterbacks and stuff?  I mean, is there a lot?  No?  No.  Well, even if you say I'm a ball player on the Jets, doesn't that help?  Really, unless you're, you know, the quarterback or the running backs, wide receivers.  The guys who get the ball.  Anybody else, yeah, other than offensive linemen.  I mean, does an offensive lineman look like he's going to get anything?  Well, you're a Jets, though.  You're a Larry Allen.  You're a fucking Eric Williams or any of those guys.  Oh, man.  That's like being a drummer, basically, then.  Oh, really, Rich? 
[04:00:00]  Is it?  Well, I'm just saying.  You can hit him any time you want.  No, no.  I would take a lot of pleasure in that, trust me.  Take a mint and just pound him in his pants.  We'd love it.  Make him pee his pants.  Where are you from, though?  Are there rules against that?  Not at all, man.  Dayton, Ohio?  Dayton, Ohio.  Oh, I was just out there.  Oh, yeah?  They just closed the GM plant there.  People are fucking broke at Wiley's.  Wow, really?  Wiley's never heard of that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Anything else fun to answer the interview?  Anything else, Debbie Downer?  Fire away when ready. 
[04:00:30]  Wow, so you play football.  Have you heard of the swine flu?  Yeah, swine flu's going around like crazy.  I'm not even wearing a mask.  I'm asking for it.  Yeah, really.  So what do you think of the first-round draft pick?  Come on.  He's the quarterback.  The Jets fans are excited.  Yeah.  I being one of them, man.  They're excited, and I'm excited.  I haven't met him yet.  Hoping to meet him tomorrow.  Is he going to get hazed as a rookie, or do the quarterbacks get out of it?  He should.  But I think as a number five pick, I think it is, I think you have to be hazed. 
[04:01:00]  And he only played 16 games.  He's gotten off easy so far, right?  Basically.  I mean, I had to play like 36 in college just to, you know, get a look.  And he plays 16, and he goes top five.  Man, that's nice.  Where did you play in college?  Ohio State.  Wow.  Good Lord.  That's one of the biggies, huh?  Not a big fan of Michigan, then.  No, not so much.  Going out on a limb there.  Not so much.  We could give the whole state back to Canada, and I'd be happy camper.  So, wait.  Did you win a championship when you were in Ohio State?  I did.  What the fuck you got the ring?  Oh, yeah. 
[04:01:30]  Not on me.  But you...  I have one.  They're crazy.  When I was in Columbus, they're crazy over football in Columbus, over Ohio State.  Oh, it's ridiculous.  The whole place shuts down over that fucking team.  See, I know a little bit about sports.  Yeah, but you know Sandy Koufax?  We're going to play golf together.  I don't know, Sandy.  How rich is the worst.  I love listening to your confidence just go away as you ask that question.  Like, I'm on a real crazy about football in that area.  I believe there's a mall.  The whole fucking thing just disappeared. 
[04:02:00]  No, I'm playing out on you there.  I just kind of...  Yeah, Rich.  Oh, hey, what, that game when you won?  Was that the Willis McGehee game when he got hit?  Yeah.  Wow, man.  I didn't do it.  Look at you.  Wow, Bill, you just blew us all away.  God damn.  I swear to God, I have no clue what you're talking about.  That's what you got over here in the studio.  What's that about, Bill?  No, no, no.  What was that one about?  It was one of the worst shots I ever saw a guy take as far as getting his knee blown out.  This is a really depressing show.  It's horrible.  I'm just letting themselves in. 
[04:02:30]  Auto plants shut down.  No bladder control.  Swine flu's running rampant.  You've got to bear with us, though.  We saw a grown man in his penis pants last hour.  A knee blown out and a closed-down plant.  There we go.  My God.  We're covering just about everything here.  O-H.  Is there anything else I can do?  What was Brett Favre like playing with?  Brett Favre was crazy.  I wasn't a fan.  No?  When everyone else was rah-rah, and I'm like, nope.  No way is this going to work out for us.  For me, it was exciting. 
[04:03:00]  Yeah, I understand.  It brought a lot of excitement to the stadium, the team, and all that.  That was good.  But I'm like, wait, we're not winning anything with Brett Favre this late in his career?  Yeah.  Sorry to say, everybody.  What made him crazy?  Well, one of his great things is he has no bodily control of gas.  Neither does the chic.  Oh, gas.  Oh, really?  He can burp with the best of them.  I put him up.  I would put him in a challenge against anybody.  Jim Norton.  When you're centered, can you tell the difference between another man's hand touching your ass? 
[04:03:30]  Like, would you know if it's Brett's hands?  Or if it was yours.  Or mine.  I see you trying to get back there, aren't you?  Would you know the difference between a man's hands and those little turtle feet that he calls hands?  Look at those things.  Those little fucking rotten reptile feet hands you have.  Palm and Nerf football.  You little fruit.  I heard he lived on Trump National Golf Course when he was here.  I don't know.  I never got invited over.  Do you play golf?  I do.  Want to go hit balls?  Let's go hit some balls after this. 
[04:04:00]  Yeah.  That's a good idea.  Why don't we get him out of here?  She's just like, what am I doing in here?  Stop having to say hello at all.  It's so obvious.  It's pretty cool, man.  Because you don't get to meet guys like this, man.  What?  Just taller men than you?  Taller men.  That's everyone you meet.  You fucking idiot.  He's shorter than me.  There's no way Norton's shorter than you.  Are you crazy?  Get up.  Holy shit.  Wow.  He's got the hat on.  Not by much.  He's also got the hat on.  He's got the lips on his shoes.  Do you have the lips on your shoes?  No, I don't have lips. 
[04:04:30]  That's the same pair of shoes you've had for four years.  Exactly.  I'm a fucking grown-up.  Do you do any fucking athletic stuff?  I'm too busy driving to gigs.  No wonder you're a fucking...  I'd fly to mine.  What athletic things are you doing in those?  Exactly.  What am I doing?  Other than tripping and falling.  First of all, these are Jordans, okay?  They're made out of plastic.  Yeah, they're awful.  Like your watch.  Shut up.  They're Air Jordans with a smoke A-Y-R to the fucking Korean knockoff.  What's that?  I've had it down to canals. 
[04:05:00]  You've got a swatch on.  This is actually a celebrity gift bag.  Thank you very much.  Shut up, a celebrity gift bag.  Yeah, I did the Spike Choice Awards.  You're a fucking major headliner.  Oh, okay.  See?  You've got it in the gift bag.  Yeah.  I like how you're checking out my watch there, Insecure.  Mine's made out of metal.  You're smashing my sneakers.  I'm headlining coconuts this weekend.  I'm at comics.  Comics, whatever.  Sorry.  Hey, do you guys get the new stadium this year, or is it next year?  It's next year.  Next year.  Next year, which is a little disappointing, because I'd like it now.  Yeah, exactly.  That's not a bad place to play football, though. 
[04:05:30]  How bad is the Meadowlands now?  Now that they know they've got a new one, are they just not even putting air fresheners in  the locker room?  I think it's going to be a bad year.  They're going to let it go.  I mean, half of the time, we don't have hot water, which gets really ugly, because some  guys won't shower after a game.  It's just bad.  That's got to stink.  So it's got to get only worse, now that they know that we're blowing it up.  Any legendary stories from the locker room, like Richard Todd and Freeman McNeil, two-on-one 
[04:06:00]  and a reporter, or anything?  No, I think that's gone to the wayside, unfortunately.  It would be nice to go back to the days.  You hear old guys talk, and you'll get them every once in a while, where guys would come  in at halftime and just light up a cigarette, and they'd be sitting there and be like, hey,  we need to block this guy better, as they're puffing away.  You know?  Yeah, and there were no cell phone cameras and YouTube.  Look how quickly you can just get busted today as an athlete.  That's swimmer there.  Guy takes one hit. 
[04:06:30]  Guy wants 20 gold medals.  Let the guy take a fucking hit.  He lost millions over that.  Yeah, he lost some zillions of dollars.  How much do you bench press?  I know it's a hack question, but...  No, it's...  We're at somewhere 415, 420.  How bad is the bar bending?  It's more on the squats.  415?  No, it isn't.  The squats, you see, some guys, our nose tackle, Chris Jenkins, biggest man you'll ever meet  in your life, and he dwarfs me, and he does like 700, 750 on squats. 
[04:07:00]  Holy shit.  Honestly, you think the bar's going to snap.  Who's the toughest bar?  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  He dwarfs you.  How tall are you?  6'4".  And how much do you weigh?  About 3'10".  And what is he?  He's probably all of 6'5", 6'6", I don't know, 6'5", a good 350.  Jesus.  It's not one of those sloppy 350s.  I'm just an animal.  He is just thick.  Aren't you filming the Tommy Morrison story?  Was that you?  It wasn't me.  Oh, why would you ask that? 
[04:07:30]  Because he looks like him.  No, he doesn't.  Yes, he does.  He doesn't look like him at all.  Or maybe it was somebody else I'm thinking about.  It's late, man.  I only slept three fucking hours.  Great visual awful inaccurate joke.  He's looking at his watch.  Thanks, Rich.  We were almost getting into, like, sports talk.  Who's the toughest guy you ever had to go up against as far as, like, blocking?  Blocking?  Probably Chris, which blows because it's every day.  You have to deal with that every day.  Game-wise, I'd have to say Vince Wilford for the Patriots.  He's another big man.  He's pretty powerful.  And it's just one of those, you know, you go into it and you go, all right, today's going 
[04:08:00]  to be a pain in the ass.  It's just going to suck.  There's nothing you can do about it.  It's just like, I'm just going to get hit now.  Can you ask anybody else for help on the line?  And, you know, if you're not doing anything over there, if nobody's rushing, could you  come on up here?  You have to.  Otherwise, you wouldn't make it through.  You just sit there and you're like, hey, you know, when you've got nothing else to do,  how about a little help this way?  And I'll pass on a bottle of scotch to you.  That's got to be like bombing on stage where you do 20 minutes of material in, like, three  minutes.  You're like, oh, my God.  Only three minutes.  Jesus, it's still the first quarter?  I've got to fuck this guy?  Still the first. 
[04:08:30]  Yeah.  I can only imagine.  It's horrible because you sit there and you're going against the guy and it's not like it  gets any easier.  He doesn't.  It's not like he drops 20 pounds in the course of the game.  Yeah, in the course of the game, right?  He's still 350.  Now, have you ever been an eligible receiver and ever gotten to score a touchdown on those  fourth and ones?  No.  Do they ever let the center do that?  Or is it always like a guard or tackle?  I don't think so.  Yeah, it's a guard or tackle.  That's the worst.  Yeah.  So, you're right.  You just gave him the look at that.  No, I like looking at it because he's really smart when it comes to this shit. 
[04:09:00]  I'm not.  I'm not.  Is anybody smart talking about anything?  That's too awful questions.  No, I got questions.  I just thought it was a look at death behind him.  He just knows he's going out of business around the Meadowlands.  How dare you ask that question?  Some more depressing statements there, Rich.  No, but do you ever go into a game going, like, you can't say this, but you go, does team  ever go in with, like, we don't have a shot against these fucking guys?  Are teams that much better than other teams in the NFL where you're going?  You know what I'm saying?  That's a good question.  That's a more negative attitude. 
[04:09:30]  Yeah.  That's a defeatist attitude.  Who would go in like that?  Any team can beat any team.  Why would you do that?  Rich, could you go down there and give them a motivational speech or something?  Even if you do win, you're going to die someday.  It might be 30 years from now, but it's going to happen.  We're all slowly dying.  You got to be realistic.  Look, it's like the Knicks know when they start the season, they're not going to the  championship game. 
[04:10:00]  They know it.  They're not good enough.  They're rebuilding.  So they just give up on the games.  No, they don't give up, but they're not going in there with the same attitude.  Look, when you're going to a gig that pays $10,000 over one that pays $2,000, you're going  in with a better attitude.  What do you say $1,000 for?  I don't know about you, Jimmy, but I always give them a show.  How about you?  Oh, shut up.  You got to give them a show.  The joy of it is we get paid the same thing every time.  Yeah.  Centers can't hit bonuses, can you?  Like if you fucking knock somebody out or something. 
[04:10:30]  Like there's bonuses for halfbacks.  There's bonuses, but you get stuck in like team bonuses.  Yeah.  I mean, there's no real stats.  That's a good question.  The quarterback takes care of you guys, right?  Yeah.  To have a good year?  Yeah.  Usually we get a nice little present.  Chad Pennington's the best.  Really?  Oh, he is.  I love Chad.  He's a great guy.  What's the best gift you got from another player?  It's probably Chad's.  He bought us my rookie year when he was comeback player of the year.  He bought us a MacBook laptop, 17-inch, you know, the brand new one that just came  out. 
[04:11:00]  It was awesome.  That doesn't suck, huh?  Yeah.  Didn't Emmett buy two?  I remember when Emmett bought his line, I think it was like Rolexes or something.  I've heard some outrageous ones.  I think Philip Rivers bought a whole bunch of guys Rolexes.  That probably gets around the league quickly, huh?  Yeah.  You're like, ooh, I'm open free agent.  Where do I want to play?  Beats the plastic watch.  I gave him a $3,500 watch for being the best man at my wedding.  First of all, it wasn't fucking...  You didn't even cover my flight to that shit hole.  You got married in a $3,500 watch.  Okay. 
[04:11:30]  It wasn't a $3,500 watch.  Yes, it was $3,500.  And you got it for free.  Okay, but still, this doesn't matter.  Shut up.  He helped write for Chris Rock.  Yeah.  On the Oscars.  Yeah.  And the Oscars.  You got the Oscar gift package.  You re-gifted to me.  I didn't ever wear it, so I didn't re-gift it.  It was a gift from me.  What's the difference if it was given to me?  It's still worse.  If someone gave you a fucking...  I'd rather have $3,500.  I don't want a fucking stupid watch.  If somebody gave you a fucking block of gold and you gave it to me, I wouldn't go, well,  he got it free.  I don't give a fuck.  Give me a better friend than you. 
[04:12:00]  You get blocks of gold a lot.  Yeah, what do they call it?  Exactly.  What else do you want?  A piece of land?  Thanks for being the best man at my wedding.  I hear some land.  Here's a parcel of land I bought from fucking Eric Estrada.  But he gave it to me, but I didn't use it, so I'm not re-gifting it.  How much can you get away with when a ref calls you for holding, you think he's full  of shit?  Can you actually curse at those guys, or are they automatically...  Oh, yeah.  You have to curse at them.  Otherwise, they won't hear you. 
[04:12:30]  What's the worst thing you've said to a referee?  That's a good question, because there's been some bad ones, some very questionable holding  calls, and there was something...  Is it just blind rage you don't really remember?  Yeah, you really just kind of let loose.  Like when you yell at cab drivers when you're driving in the city, you kind of just let  go.  You know what I always thought would be great is if they had an adult version NFL, and  they just miked all the players, and you could actually hear what the hell they said to  the referee.  That would be pretty cool. 
[04:13:00]  I'm going to watch that.  Yeah, trying to figure out what they're saying.  Like a pay-per-view, adults only, and yeah, it was good.  I mean, it's just...  Usually the two shitheads calling the game.  How can you make that shitty call, you know, you're costing me money, I'm taking it out of  your pocket, I'm coming after you.  Like, you kind of get a little personal with it.  But I think it's the people that get up in faces, and you know, that they don't really  like, because we are quite larger than them, so they've kind of...  That's when they throw the flags, but if you're kind of staying back and just dog cussing 
[04:13:30]  the shit out of them from, you know, a good five yards, they hear you, but they're not  going to do anything.  What do you mean costing you money?  You got to pay a penalty every time...  I mean, you got to pay money when you get a penalty call on you?  There's different fines and stuff.  Get the fuck out.  All right, Tyson Walter told us about that.  Holy fuck, you make a mistake.  They fine you for all sorts of shit in the NFL.  Especially within the team.  Like, within our offensive line, we have a fine system that, you know, we reward and  fine each other.  And it's just within the offensive line, but that can get expensive. 
[04:14:00]  Like, how much is a fine if you run the ball back the wrong way and score for the other  team?  You might as well just quit.  I mean, you're down and out by that point.  You're running the wrong way.  There's nothing you can do about it.  What's your schedule look like this year?  Looks pretty good.  It seems some good teams and some teams that, you know, you're hoping won't be that good,  but you never know until you get going into the season.  Who's the biggest play...  I'm sorry, Billy.  Who's the biggest guy, like, that you looked up to that you had to play against? 
[04:14:30]  That I'd play against?  Yeah, like a guy that you've...  Oh, Big Daddy.  Big Daddy Wilkinson.  He was from Ohio State, and I played against him when he was in Miami.  It was just one of those things, like, you know, I watched you, Ohio State, and I, you  know, really enjoyed what you did, and now playing against you, and it's just, it's weird.  Like, Junior Sale was another one, and just, like, you sit there, and you're like, I don't  think I should be out here. 
[04:15:00]  Yeah.  How the hell did I get here?  Yeah.  Who's the...  I don't know if you don't want to name names, but maybe you can say what they did.  Who's the dirtiest guy you ever went up against?  Like, every time the ref wasn't looking, you try to go underneath your mask?  I don't remember his name, so we're good there, but guy was just miserable, and I killed him.  I took him down, had a great block on him.  I'm getting up, and he kind of gives us a little shot to the nuts, and you just...  So I dropped a knee on him.  Nice 310-pound knee.  And you're... 
[04:15:30]  Backed with anger.  And you're just, you're like, why?  You know, you got beat.  Make it better on the next play.  You don't have to go, you know, being dirty just to make things better.  Besides, it feels good, you asshole.  Yeah, go ahead.  I remember...  Tickle him again, motherfucker.  Do it again.  Go ahead.  When I played sports league...  Oh, Jesus.  I'm trying to relate with this guy.  What did you do here?  In the Air Jordans?  Yes, you got a leather helmet.  In the Air Jordans.  Jesus.  I played sports league, and I played halfback. 
[04:16:00]  You know, my first year, I was center on the Rams, but then when I was on the Bears...  I played half-wit.  And just some guys would come up against me.  And I remember we'd come up against Bradley Wilson and Carter, man, and I was running  the ball around the end, and they crushed me, and I went back to the huddle.  I had snot coming down my nose.  I was crying, and that's when I just ended my football career.  I'm just saying, you know, I can relate to a lot of his shit, man.  I can relate to a lot of it.  Let's thank Eric for stopping by.  Yeah, yeah.  On that note...  Yes.  I see that. 
[04:16:30]  They want to get him out of here.  Wow.  Actually smiling, has he thought of other things?  Just so negative.  Yeah, he really is.  Here I am.  I'm a man.  I'm crying.  He's not right now.  Oh, no, I was in sixth grade.  Eric, he's not here every day, so come back and see us, all right?  Yeah.  Yes.  You were in sixth grade, but you were 22.  Still illegal.  They're trying to drag him out of here.  He's got a busy schedule.  This was cool, Eric.  Thank you for stopping by.  Thank you, man.  Thank you.  Eric Mangold from the Jets.  Thank you, guys.  Thank you.  Nice meeting you, man.  And we're going to get the F out of here. 
[04:17:00]  Fine luck.  Voss, once again, comics.  Comics this weekend.  Friday and Saturday.  Bill Burr starts his Caroline's run tonight.  Yep.  Thursday through Sunday.  Two shows Friday, three on Saturday, and one on Thursday and Sunday.  I'm an idiot.  Go see Bill.  Thanks for having me, guys.  Seriously.  Please.  You're the best, man.  I'm such an asshole.  Nick Mangold.  In what way?  What do you mean?  I mean, when he comes in, he offers something.  He's funny.  He's got great stories.  He's got a plastic watch.  He's compelling. 
[04:17:30]  He's multi-faceted.  He's a smart guy.  He's not just a dumb fuck that comes in and sits down and just brings the show to a grinding  halt.  Well, you're not saying I'd do that.  No, no.  I'm saying that if somebody did do that.  Because I am a dumb fuck at times.  He just gave me a compliment, Rich.  From fucking noon to noon.  We've got to go.  We've got to go.  It was Nick Mangold, by the way.  I'm an asshole.  Nick Mangold from the Jets.  He called America.  It's close.  He's got four letters.  Real close.  What a fucking day this was.  No, no.  It's got four letters with a eye. 
[04:18:00]  I pissed myself.  I'm going to make up for that when you see the greatest promotional shot ever taken of  me and Jimmy.  Oh, yeah.  It is the greatest shot ever taken in this studio.  Unbelievable.  I just sent it out to the peeps.  Opie and Anthony, we'll see you guys tomorrow.  Thank you. </pre>
