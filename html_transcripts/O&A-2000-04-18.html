<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with Opie complaining about back pain, segueing into a discussion about booking the comedy duo Otto and George.  A substantial portion is dedicated to the WWE, specifically Stone Cold Steve Austin's return and his feud with The Rock.  The hosts repeatedly play and dissect a poorly-executed station ID by Jimmy Superfly Snooker, punctuated by the phrase "Ouch."  Listeners call in to discuss wrestling and other topics, often using profane language.  Several prank calls are played, including one to a Green Bay funeral home attempting to arrange for a deceased Packers fan to watch the Super Bowl, and another where a caller "wins" $100,000 but receives a candy bar.  Other comedic segments include a fictional angry roofing company call featuring "Jim Bob," and a discussion about a CD of Anthony's music for sale on eBay.  The show mentions an upcoming "Make Bridget Cry" segment, which will feature a live waxing.  A tape of Scott Muni broadcasting live from the Empire State Building during the 1977 New York City blackout is played.  The hosts discuss their low sales of the "Demeter World" CD, and field calls from listeners regarding its availability.

The show then delves into a collection of listener-submitted urban legends and outrageous stories, including a man receiving a concrete enema, various gerbil incidents, and objects found lodged in rectums (a lightbulb, coffee can, and umbrella).  The discussion touches on the supposed prevalence of homosexuality in the entertainment industry, referencing James Dean and Marlon Brando.  A caller shares a story about a picture of Marlon Brando and Wally Cox, leading to a bit about the two.  Another caller details her first experience with anal sex, prompting suggestive and explicit humor from the hosts.  Other bizarre anecdotes are shared, including a woman finding a plastic banana inside another woman.  The hosts discuss a company offering alibis for cheating spouses and Anthony's difficulties recording commercial tags.  A prank call featuring "Green Poopy" from their Demeter World CD is also played.  Bridget is mentioned as being in the studio for a waxing appointment.

A caller describes being uncontrollably amused by the show, leading to anecdotes about her reactions at home and work.  The hosts discuss a staff member nicknamed "Spaz," who screens calls.  Several callers phone in, sharing graphic stories of rectal injuries and other explicit sexual experiences.  Anthony's struggles recording a commercial, with multiple outtakes playing, are highlighted.  A prank call involving repeated requests for "butt plugs" is played.  Listeners share their reactions to the showâ€™s humor and content.  The focus shifts to Bridget, scheduled for a live Brazilian bikini wax.  The hosts, waxing technicians, and Rick (a staff member) describe the procedure graphically, interspersed with Bridget's reactions.  The segment ends with the waxing still in progress.

The show continues with the live waxing of the 19-year-old virgin, Bridget.  The hosts and crew provide a running commentary on the process, detailing the application of wax to the "taint" and Bridget's reactions of pain.  The discussion includes descriptions of the sensations, the appearance of the waxed area, and the application of aftercare products.  Bridget's virginity is repeatedly emphasized.  The wax technicians are referred to as the "wax ladies."  There's discussion about whether the hosts can see the results, which Bridget refuses to show.  The hosts examine the used wax strips, with one host describing the hair as "bright red."  A caller, Keith, initially requests Bridget be taken off the air but changes his mind.  Other callers weigh in, offering waxing advice and sharing their own experiences. One caller mentions Bridget's previous appearance with her boyfriend, who called her a "whore" after an attempted oral sex encounter.  The segment concludes with the hosts promoting the waxing salon and thanking everyone involved.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony, 1027 WNEW  Some days, you know, for a lap ride, and other days we just flat out suck, we know it.  Interesting and true.  Opie and Anthony, 1027 WNEW  Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch. 
[00:00:30]  Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.  That sounds like Jimmy Superfly Snooker saying ouch.  Yes, we have a new sound to play with over and over again on the Opie and Anthony show.  Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.  Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch. 
[00:01:00]  What's up, brother man?  What's slacking him?  Not much.  It's 212-757-1027 is our phone number.  It's the O&A Show.  Back line, 212-957-9639.  How's the back, my friend?  Oh.  A bunch of people noticed I was a little irritated yesterday.  Just a tad.  Well, when you have shooting pain up and down your back and your legs and you feel like you have cerebral palsy because you can't walk, you too would be irritated. 
[00:01:30]  Cerebral palsy.  I remember that from the Otto and George show at Caroline's.  That was hilarious.  Oh, my legs.  My legs.  I can't feel my legs.  I got palsy.  Are we going to get Otto and George on the show?  There's a rumor out there that George wants to come on the show.  Or is it Otto?  Yeah.  Who's the dummy, Otto?  Otto's the dummy.  George is the comedian.  No. 
[00:02:00]  It's Otto?  No.  George is the dummy.  Right.  And Otto's the dude.  Really?  Yeah.  The next road show.  Really?  I thought.  Hey, the next road show, whatever it takes, we need Otto and George live in front of 1,400 people.  Hell, yeah.  To do like a quick 10 or 15 minutes.  The place will lose it.  Mm-hmm.  Absolutely lose it.  All right.  Let's get rocking on the phone lines here, okay?  Oh, by the way, I know why Mark from Rascals is calling. 
[00:02:30]  We just played Bobby Slayton.  That was a repeat.  Oh, why?  There are some time.  You better run and grab Mark from Rascals.  I know that's why he's calling.  Dude, we're getting a ton of phone calls about Bobby Slayton.  That was a repeat from a couple weeks ago.  Oops.  Sorry.  He's probably freaking out, man.  You know, with people calling up looking for tickets for Bobby Slayton.  That passed already.  Well, just give him tickets for something else.  Hey, we tricked a lot of people into thinking we started at two today.  Oops.  I don't think we're fooling anybody. 
[00:03:00]  Nah, we're not fooling the faithful listeners.  Uh-uh.  But no, Bobby Slayton is not at Rascals.  He came and went, okay?  All right, let's go to the phones, Anthony, on this Tuesday.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  George, what's going on?  Hey, guys, what's up?  How are you, George?  I'm pretty good.  Good.  I saw a wow sign on WWF yesterday.  I saw that, too, right behind the announcer's table.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Ouch. 
[00:03:30]  Ouch.  I'm kind of pissed at that guy, though.  He had a great opportunity.  They were on the announcers.  You saw the wow real fast.  Well, they weren't in New York yesterday.  That's the thing.  Well, they were in Philly.  Oh.  But, I mean, he holds up the wow sign to the camera for two seconds,  and then he pulls it down and starts just mugging for the camera  and waving to his friends.  Yeah, that sucks.  But I've got to say, Raw's war was great last night.  Yeah.  We all found out that Stone Cold Steve Austin is coming back for the next pay-per-view. 
[00:04:00]  You're damn right.  It's about time.  We need Stone Cold Steve Austin back in the WWF.  Stone Cold Steve Austin.  What a, what a, what a, I don't know.  Last time I saw him, his neck was still screwed up.  He was, where was that?  WrestleMania.  They showed a quick clip.  Yeah, they showed a clip of him.  Of the convention center where he was signing some stuff,  and he's like, yeah, well, I'm looking forward to getting back to work.  And you just see, he's like, like a machine, all stiff.  Yeah, he's like Opie.  Yeah, true.  All stiff.  Ouch. 
[00:04:30]  Ouch.  God damn.  All right, George.  All right.  Thank you.  Syndication may be next year.  Yeah, whatever.  Ouch.  Later.  Let's give up on that syndication now, crap.  Yeah.  I hope our faithful listeners find it as funny as we do when we just over-douche stuff.  Ouch.  I could just play this all day. 
[00:05:00]  Ouch.  Hey, where is the Jimmy Superfly Snooker ID?  Yeah.  Absolutely brilliant.  That thing's great.  A brilliant piece of radio.  Ouch.  After our Jimmy Superfly Snooker interview, that was a little strange to say the least yesterday, Anthony.  Just a bit.  Superfly went into the other studio to do one of those IDs for our radio show.  Yeah.  It took them over three minutes to say, hi, I am Jimmy Superfly Snooker, and you're listening 
[00:05:30]  to O.P. and Anthony on 1027 WNAW.  Yeah, let's...  Ouch.  It took over three minutes.  Psycho Mark cut it down to a minute and a half piece and check this out.  Here it is.  From yesterday.  Okay.  O.P. and Anthony.  1-1.  2.7.  1-2.  1-2.  Yes, yes, yes, yes.  Mm-hmm.  O.P. and Anthony on 1027.  Now, this is the Superfly Jimmy Snooker, and you, uh... 
[00:06:00]  Okay, I understand.  Ouch.  You're listening to O.P. and Anthony.  Now, this is Superfly Jimmy Snooker, and you're listening to O.P. and Anthony on 1027 WNEW.  Ouch.  Right again, 1227.  102...  102.7.  Yeah, what don't we call it 102.7?  Okay, 102.7. 
[00:06:30]  On WNEW.  You want to say his name and stuff?  Oh, my God.  Uh, you want to say his name and stuff?  Ouch.  Jimmy, Superfly Jimmy Snooker, one more time, and I'll edit that in.  Ouch.  If you're Superfly Jimmy Snooker, and you're listening to O.P. and Anthony on 1027,  WNEW, Superfly Jimmy Snooker on your radio doll.  Thanks, man.  Thanks, man. 
[00:07:00]  Okay, brother.  Ouch.  Okay, brother.  Ouch.  Be quiet, son.  What?  What do you got, Psycho Mark?  I was saying there's a bunch of okay brothers on that card.  Yeah, I know.  Here it is.  Okay, brother.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Oh, the poor guy.  The poor guy.  That's classic, man.  You've got to love that. 
[00:07:30]  All right, let's go to Ron.  Ron, what's going on?  Hello, brother.  Yes, brother.  I can't believe you found somebody from the Isle of Fiji that speaks English.  Wow, that's debatable.  Wow, that's true.  Listen, some close friends of mine that work up in Connecticut told me that even though  Boston's going to be in the Rock's corner, you guys are getting your payback because he  is going to smoke the Rock with a chair in the back of the head during the championship  match.  Yeah, it's obvious that they're not going to remain packed.  He's going to be fucking with the McMahons, so it's going to be great. 
[00:08:00]  You're going to see that half-breed get what's really coming to them.  Cool, man.  Thank you.  All right.  All right.  Yeah, it's obvious that they're not going to just be friends.  No, of course not.  The Rock and Stone Cold.  Of course not.  They're going to get into a brawl there when Stone Cold is in the Rock's corner.  Yeah.  For the next pay-per-view.  All right, let's go to Chuck.  Chuck, what's going on?  How you doing, guys?  Pretty good.  That is the best promo since Fat Louie Anderson with the show-me-puddin'.  Oh, show-me-puddin'.  Yeah, I mean, that's just classic. 
[00:08:30]  It's just too good.  All right.  Thank you, Chuck.  All right, guys.  Bye.  All right.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Andrew, what's going on?  What's up, O&A?  Hey.  Yo.  I love it.  The Rock's not going to...  The Rock's going to get jumped by Austin because he's making Mummy Part 2.  Uh-huh.  He's going to be out for two months.  Oh, really?  Yeah, so that's why Austin's come back.  Supposedly he's going to injure The Rock.  The Rock is going to make Mummy Part 2?  Yeah.  Ouch.  Ah, yeah.  Yo, guys.  That's right. 
[00:09:00]  Well, it's obvious something's going to happen with Stone Cold Steve Austin in The Rock.  Yo, guys.  Yeah.  Syndication when Cringe comes out.  Yeah, right.  Jesus.  That's a double whammy.  Our whole lives have been put on hold.  And Cringe will come out when we're syndicated.  Yeah, exactly.  All right, boys.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  All right, let's go to Bill.  Bill, you're next on N.E.W.  Hey, what's up, guys?  How are you?  Hey, I saw Snooker wrestle in a high school gym in New Jersey a few months ago.  Ouch.  He moves as slowly as he talks. 
[00:09:30]  He laid on the ground for about 20 minutes while the guy pounded him.  Then, of course, he climbed on the top rope, did the jump, and the match.  Okay, brother.  Then they pulled out Nikolai Volkov.  Ouch.  It was like all the wrestlers who were too old for WCW.  Yeah.  You could hire them for your birthday party.  Oh, right on, man.  All right.  Well, thank you, bro.  Communication neighbor. 
[00:10:00]  Never.  Yeah, thanks.  Communication neighbor.  That's just my answer.  They're right there.  That's why we love it.  Oh, okay, brother.  Anne-Marie, what's up?  Hey.  Okay, brother.  Hey.  I just wanted to let you know the reason why Stone Cold is coming back.  All right.  The Rock is filming a movie.  So, he's going to take a sabbatical.  Yeah, I think we just heard that.  Yeah.  Wow.  Did we just hear that?  Ouch.  Ouch.  All right.  Well, thank you, Anne-Marie.  Sure.  I'm going to be in that movie, too, brother.  I'm playing the mummy.  No, we have to. 
[00:10:30]  They just wrap me up and leave me on the table.  Ouch.  You know what we've got to cut a card up is Superfly saying, okay, brother, to go along  with our okay, terrific.  Okay, terrific.  Let's hear.  You got okay, brother?  No, I just got the brother.  Oh.  Okay, brother.  That's okay.  Yeah.  I thought that just said brother.  Okay, terrific.  Oh, that's too loud.  Yeah, let me turn you down.  Okay, here's Superfly.  Okay, brother.  Okay, terrific.  Ouch.  Let's go to Jim. 
[00:11:00]  Hey, Jim, what's going on today?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  I have nothing about wrestling to speak about.  No, it's okay.  I think we got it all out.  Stone Cold's coming back.  It looks like he's going to turn on The Rock during the pay-per-view, and The Rock is going  to be filming Dummy 2.  Mummy 2.  That's right, brother.  I'm filming Dummy 2.  Hey, Anne, there's a CD up for sale on eBay.  Really?  It's called Rock Gut.  Oh, yeah?  Does that sound familiar to you?  It could, yeah. 
[00:11:30]  Sure.  I was in that band.  Oh, it is.  It is your band.  Why?  It's listed as your band.  Oh, really?  I wanted to know if it was for real.  On eBay?  Yeah, it's like 30 bucks.  Which, did it show the album cover?  No, it was something about the Apollo, though.  Whoops.  Yeah, that's the one.  That's the one.  Oh, so it is for real.  That's for real.  Okay.  Of course.  Okay, terrific.  That great music couldn't be kept at bay.  Is it worth 30 bucks?  No.  Are you kidding? 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, buy it for 30 bucks, and then we'll sign it for you.  Okay, good.  Actually, it says something about having the trade take place on the air.  Great.  Great.  Your brother probably put it up there for a second.  Oh, let's see.  Is your brother in the band, too?  I want to see.  I'm looking it up right now to see.  What is the description?  Bah, bah, bah.  Okay, it's got all the things.  30 bucks.  Winner, bidder, what else is shipping and handling? 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, look at that.  I don't know who this is.  Is it Long Island?  Could be my brother.  No.  Seller.  Scott4Arrels.com.  No, that's not my brother.  Who is that?  I'm going to write him an email right now.  Who the F are you?  Guy's selling my pass.  All right, Jim.  Thank you.  All right, man.  Thanks.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Let's go to Fred.  Fred, you're next on N.E.W.  How are you?  Oh, and hey.  What's going on?  Hey, man.  What's up? 
[00:13:00]  I saw Otto and George on Saturday.  Oh, man.  Best show I ever saw.  Wasn't it great?  Yeah, best show.  Yeah, we're going to try to get Otto and George on the show soon.  Yeah, you said he was coming back in two weeks.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, he was going out to Las Vegas.  Uh-huh.  He's coming back in two weeks to play Rascals.  Oh, cool.  Yeah, I was just going to call up right now for tickets, see what's going on.  If that's the truth, you guys should get your tickets in advance because Otto and George,  absolutely an amazing, amazing show.  Yeah.  You've got to have him at the road show.  Uh, we're going to try to do that.  You've got to do it. 
[00:13:30]  Imagine that.  The Pope joke on the plane?  Oh, the Pope joke on the plane.  That was the funniest joke I've ever heard.  Yeah, don't even give it out.  No, I can't say that again.  All right.  Yeah, but to see Otto and George in front of 1,400 people at one of our road shows,  he would kill.  Oh, God.  All right, Fred, thank you.  All right.  Thanks a lot, O.N.  Bye.  Bye.  Superfly's on the air.  He wants to talk about yesterday's interview, Anthony.  Superfly.  What up, brother?  What's up?  I'm sorry about yesterday's interview, brother.  Yeah?  That's what happens when you're as dumb as a box of rocks, brother. 
[00:14:00]  You know all the coconuts that I got hit in my head, brother?  But it's all good.  It's lovely, brother.  Ouch.  Ouch, brother.  The last time I was at a radio station, it took me 10 minutes to do an ID.  Yeah.  So you guys should feel fortunate that Brother Snooker did the right thing.  Ouch.  Like, you're down three.  All right, Superfly.  All right, boys.  Peace, love, and chicken grease.  All right.  Thanks for stopping by yesterday. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, no problem, brother.  All right.  Love me.  Bye.  You might remember me, Superfly Snooker on Taxi.  I went by the name Reverend Jim.  Ouch.  Too funny.  Okey-doke.  Killer, man. 
[00:15:00]  I love it.  Yes.  Superfly.  Ouch.  I walked too far.  You want to play some of this today, Ed?  Yeah, that's some pretty funny stuff.  We got a CD.  Well, it's a CD.  Ed and I have been jamming in the back office for a very, very long time.  I got to see if this is the track.  Hold on.  Electric.  Oh, no.  Okay.  No, it's the next one.  And we like turning our listeners on to different stuff, right, Anthony? 
[00:15:30]  Yes.  Well, we've been jamming this for, I don't know, a couple of years now.  It's the Touchstone Terrorist.  Yeah.  With the retarded hillbilly.  Mm-hmm.  And we figured we'd play a few of these today on our radio show as we take a break here,  okay?  All right.  Oh.  Jim Bob, the retarded hillbilly, calling like a break shop, I believe.  Yeah.  And it's pretty wacky.  Check this out.  We'll be back in just a bit here.  Stay there.  Break. 
[00:16:00]  Listen to me.  You shabby pea-brain roof.  You people, Bill, just caves in over here.  Hello?  I ain't got no roof, you bird brain.  You people call you so professional, professional nincompoops.  What?  Who in the hell is this?  You're not supposed to sleep with a livestock?  You put Scooter on the phone, you bird brain. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, do you know who the f*** you're talking to, pal?  Lee, listen, you smartass.  You people go give me a refund.  I'm sick and tired of you.  Do you know who you're f***ing talking to?  Who are you trying to call, you dumb son of a bitch?  You're talking to you.  You can sit a boy and kiss my country ass,  because I will come down for a refund.  Well, who are you trying to call?

[00:17:30]  Titty break.  Can you figure that out, you man?  Yes, you don't.  Titty break.  Oh, I gotta sit on my ass and wait on you people all day.  You say you's gonna be here at twelve noon.  Who in the f*** is this?  This is Jim Bob.  You know, people say you's gonna be in my, look at my room at twelve noon.  Now, listen to me, you old f***er. 
[00:18:00]  You called me last week, and I told you three goddamn times.  You don't call me.  This ain't no f***ing company.  This is f***ing company.  This is f***ing break.  You don't call me up, cussing me out, telling me this s***.  You better call the right f***ing number, you old mother.  You ain't lucky I'm in a wheelchair.  Well, you come on down here, and I'll show you a little bit of ass whooping.  You don't call me up talking me that way.  You got the wrong f***ing number.  Why didn't you say...  Do you want to talk to a roofing company? 
[00:18:30]  Why didn't you say the wrong number?  I told you that three times last week, you old mother.  You said the people...  F***ing break.  Why didn't you say the people all like you're stubborn?  Like saddle sores?  Well, I'll tell you what, sir.  I do not know who you think you are talking to. 
[00:19:00]  Why didn't you say I had the wrong number?  I told you that three times last week, you had the wrong number.  You said the people you all like, ain't you?  You're people from...  I can tell you from the city.  Where the hell are you from?  I'm from Gators Creek, Georgia.  We don't have health clubs or smog or s***head city people. 
[00:19:30]  Is that right?  We don't have paved roads.  I should have never moved out here to...  Save your breath for a minute, mister.  Are you looking for a roofing company?  Scooter's Roofing.  Scooter's Roofing.  Well, why don't you try dialing the right number and quit wasting my valuable time?  Your name, Rod.  Your societal sore.  F***.  Why don't you try calling the right damn place and quit wasting my time? 
[00:20:00]  Do that in the background.  Is that Scooter?  This is not Scooter's Roofing.  You sure about that?  God damn it, mister.  Get it through your f***head.  You got the wrong goddamn number.  Now quit wasting my f***ing time.  Opie and Anthony, 1027, WNEW. 
[00:20:30]  It's the ONA Show.  Thanks for joining us today.  212-757-1027 is our phone number.  Yeah.  I believe we have Bridget coming in from Make Bridget Cry.  What's she doing?  She's getting her first waxing live on the air today.  Oh, yeah.  I forgot about that.  Sweet, innocent, shy Bridget getting her taint waxed today.  Virgin.  Yes. 
[00:21:00]  I need my own pot for this one.  Wait, do that again, Ant.  Virgin.  Ouch.  Virgin.  Ouch.  Virgin.  Ouch.  Hey!  Ouch.  Virgin.  Coming.  Ouch.  Coming.  Ouch.  Coming.  Ouch.  Virgin.  Ouch.  And then we get new sounds every day, and then we beat it to death.  And then we got to find something else new. 
[00:21:30]  We humor ourselves around here, you know?  Yeah.  All right.  So what time is she coming in?  Like 4.30 or so?  Very, very good.  Virgin.  That's always good.  A lot of people are requesting the Artie Milo prank call, Anthony.  Artie Milo.  Which one was that?  That was one we did.  I used a few Artie Milos.  Artie Milo.  I think he's talking about the time we called the Green Bay Funeral Home.  Artie Milo.  Oh, that one. 
[00:22:00]  For the Super Bowl.  Artie Milo started out.  The voice of Sam Drucker.  Remember that?  Green Acres.  Sam Drucker.  And I called him Mr. Drucker when we talked to him.  Yeah, we did talk to him.  We played Dead or Alive with him.  Yes, we did.  We haven't played Dead or Alive in a while.  No, we haven't had phone numbers of ancient celebrities that we could call up and see if  they're dead or alive.  I've run out of phone numbers, but if anyone out there has connections and has phone numbers  of very, very old celebrities, we need them because we play a game called Alive 
[00:22:30]  or Dead where we make a bet whether or not the person's alive or dead.  We bet a beer usually, and the guy who loses has to tell the person why we're calling.  Yeah.  It's like, oh, you're alive, huh?  We called because we're playing Alive or Dead.  Yeah, it's a brilliant little game.  And to the bitches from prison that want to get a hold of us today, call back.  Yeah.  Stinky hung up on, you know, babes and Heat.  Yeah, Caged Heat.  We had Caged Heat calling the show, and Stinky freaking hung up on him. 
[00:23:00]  Look, he's jumping up and down.  Get him in here, Stinky.  Tell him why he hung up.  Did you or did you not hang up on the Caged Heat that just called in a little while ago?  Yes, I did.  Now, why do you hang up on Caged Heat?  Female prisoners, they go to the front of the line in phone calls.  Because every time I've gotten a call, Spaz has told me to hang up because we don't accept  collect calls anymore.  Who told him we don't accept collect calls anymore?  I believe that was a Spaz executive decision. 
[00:23:30]  Ha!  Now, we only accept them from prisons.  Right.  That's all.  All Caged Heat gets right through to the radio show.  And, yeah, the male prisoners, we might blow off and not put them through.  But the lady prisoners get through regardless.  Doesn't matter.  Caged Heat.  All right.  Stories about the laundry room and the broom handle.  Remember that Linda Blair movie?  Oh, my God.  In the shower, she's getting the broom handle.  So, every time there's a prison film on TV, you've got to stop for a while. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  Female prison.  All right.  So, hopefully, they'll call back, Anthony.  You want to play this prank call?  I mean, we could turn it into, like, a prank call day.  Oh, wait a minute.  We've got tons of them we can play.  We haven't played a lot of these in a long time.  Now, we just played a prank call.  So, if we play another one, are you saying we're doing two-fers today?  We could do two-fers of prank calls.  But we don't have two for Tuesday anymore, Alfie.  Yeah, we lost that.  We lost the lucrative two-for-Tuesday position. 
[00:24:30]  Another radio station has stolen two-for-Tuesday.  Oh, no.  And we don't know what to do in its place.  Oh, no.  What are we going to do?  How will we survive?  Where will we get the strength to go on?  Two-for-Tuesday.  Oh, brother.  Ouch.  Ouch.  God damn, I love that one.  Yeah. 
[00:25:00]  All right, Ant.  Well, we can play this real fast.  Yeah.  It's all for our Dementor World CD.  Yeah.  Remember that?  When we actually wanted to put a CD out with a radio station.  And we put a bunch of bits together and put the CD out.  Believe it or not.  Oh, what a problem.  Believe it or not.  It made it out there.  No problems.  Made an S-load of money.  Yeah.  We didn't get sued for it.  A ton of people bought this thing about two and a half years ago.  We were supposed to have a follow-up to this.  But for some reason, the lawyers think we have some problems with our material these days. 
[00:25:30]  I don't understand it.  We were going to have a double CD out called Cringe.  That was supposed to be out six months ago.  Yeah.  Six months ago.  That was before our lives were put on hold.  Everyone's laughing at us.  We'll laugh at you.  Ouch.  All right.  We can play this real fast. 
[00:26:00]  We had a request for it.  All right.  I don't know.  It was when the Packers and the Patriots were in the Super Bowl a few years back.  Yeah.  And we called a funeral home in Green Bay, Wisconsin.  Gee, I'm trying to remember that game.  I believe the Pats did really well.  What a circus.  We actually were broadcasting live from someplace up in Boston during that game.  By halftime, everyone was just drunk.  Not even paying attention to the game. 
[00:26:30]  Just a blowout.  And they still got bled so, don't they?  Don't they understand?  I like when he screws up, like, oh, and Bloodsoe throws, intercepted.  And he walks off the field smiling.  Yeah.  Like with a smirk on his face.  No, because he knows how much money he's making.  Yeah, he doesn't suck so bad.  Jack off.  Well, our Jets aren't doing much better.  Yeah, well, at least they have a reason.  All right.  So off to Meta World.  We called a funeral home in Green Bay, Wisconsin.  It was right around the Super Bowl.  And this is pretty freaking brutal. 
[00:27:00]  Check it out.  Do you know him?  Hello?  Yes, ma'am.  Okay.  My name's Artie Milo.  Uh-huh.  And my father recently passed away.  Did your dad pass away, did you say?  Yes.  Yes, he did.  When was that?  I don't know.  Two, three days ago.  Okay.  Now, he wanted to watch the Super Bowl with his family.  Uh-huh.  And we just want to know if there's a way you can come over and, like, you know, temporarily,  you know, prop him up in the big chair so when the family comes over he'll be okay until 
[00:27:30]  after the Super Bowl and then we'll bury him?  No, we can't do that, Mr. Milo.  Oh, it was his one dream to watch the Packers in the Super Bowl.  And we already painted his face green and gold.  No, but it would, you mean, not get him until then?  Yeah, well, you could come over and maybe, you know, pump him with whatever you do and,  you know, preserve him until after the bowl.  No, I'm afraid we just can't do it.  Why? 
[00:28:00]  It was his dream, you know, to watch the Packers in the bowl.  Uh-huh.  And we've been holding on to him for a couple of days now.  He's been in the barn, but, you know, the coyotes have been a-nipping and I don't think  he's going to make it until Sunday.  No, he died.  Who knows that he has died?  Hopefully, uh, no one.  But we just want you to come over and, you know, prop him up in the chair and maybe open  up his hand so we can put a beer in there.  And we can't, we can't do that.  We can't embalm anybody at home.  Embalm, that's the word.  And once they're embalmed, they can't be, you know, they can't be in a sitting position. 
[00:28:30]  You know, it just kind of...  Well, he's been in a sitting position now and he's getting kind of hard.  But if you could maybe do something and then lay him down later?  No, I'm not sure we can't.  We'd even be up to, you know, if you've got to break something, it's okay.  No, we don't do that.  It was his one lifetime dream.  Did you see the pack in the bowl with his family?  And we got the big screen TV and the chair for him and he went up and died.  We will not do that.  If your dad has died and if you really have not notified anybody, you do have to do that.  You have to have the medical examiner's approval to take him away. 
[00:29:00]  Okay, look, what if we put the coffin in the house and put the TV on the coffin?  That way he'll be with the family.  Is there a law or something?  No, if he was embalmed and if he was, you know, able, you know, like if there was, if  there's no problem as far as preserving him.  Right, and could you put like a pack banner in his hand?  Because it was his dream to see the packs in the bowl.  We could probably do that.  You could put a pack, oh, that's okay?  Mm-hmm.  I don't know if we could have a visitation, you know, in the house depending on how, you 
[00:29:30]  know, how well he preserved he was and if we could get a casket into the house.  But once he's, you know, once he's embalmed, he is laying down.  Right.  Okay, do you think that's like degrading if we put the cheesehead hat on him?  Do you want me to call the medical examiner for you?  Oh, no, that might not be a good idea.  Then we'd have to try to explain where his feet went.  Bye.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Oh, to be wild.  Boo, boo, boo. 
[00:30:00]  Or stupidity on the way.  One, two, seven, WNW.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  212-757-1027 is our phone number.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Welcome back to winter.  Yeah.  Trying to break out the winter coat today. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, you're getting these nice days and then all of a sudden it sucks again.  You open the door, you don't know what to expect.  It's cold.  I guess tomorrow it's going to be all right, though.  Man.  We're doing weather breaks now?  Yeah.  Sunny, 60 degrees tomorrow.  Near weather.  We might have to break out Whip-A-Mile Wednesday officially tomorrow.  Yeah.  I think tomorrow we finally do it.  So get those wow signs ready for your ride.  I've seen a lot of trucks already.  Wow on the back.  Oh, very good.  Yeah, they're gearing up.  We've got the new wow stickers coming in any day. 
[00:31:00]  They're going to be all over the tri-state area.  But even though the wow stickers are so much cooler this year than the crappy ones we had last year,  we still like when you guys make your homemade signs and get into it.  I mean, you guys get crazy with your wow signs.  Ones that light up and all sorts of crap going on.  Yeah.  But I think tomorrow's the day.  I think we finally break it out.  We've got to start somewhere, and I believe tomorrow will be that day.  All right.  What's going on over there, Anthony?  I'm just reading during the commercials.  Amazing, huh? 
[00:31:30]  I'm kidding.  Yeah, what's up with that?  You're not trading today.  No, I had to go long on some of my stocks now.  Yeah.  I'm pulling out of the options business for a little while.  Just for a little while.  It stabilizes a bit.  All right.  I'm a little out of control.  Was I the only stupid one that put more money into the market yesterday?  No, you're running it good.  You're long-term.  You're long on these things.  I don't know, man.  You're doing a good job.  The damn market scares the crap out of me, and I was talked into putting more money into the market.  Yeah.  I bought in yesterday.  Did you?  Same biotech you on. 
[00:32:00]  And if my broker's listening, I didn't even give Anthony a tip.  He came in with that tip on his own.  I love that one.  All right.  It's one of my favorites.  I made a lot of money on that before I lost it all.  All right.  So you're not day trading.  You have time to go through the papers.  Yeah.  Time to actually read.  It's amazing.  They put these letters together, and they create words when you put them all together.  And then sentences.  It's an amazing thing.  This reading.  Before you get into that, do you want to get rid of your brother?  He's calling up.  Oh, Joe's online?  Yeah.  Hold on.  1, 2, 1.  Because he gets pissed when we don't go to him. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  He'll start getting, like, airsick and start screaming and punching people.  Hey, Joe, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  I just wanted to straighten that out about that eBay thing.  Yeah, who is that?  I have no clue.  It's some guy from our old high school, John H. Glenn.  It was probably somebody that picked up a CD at a live show years back, and now he wants  to cash in on it.  Yeah, he said I gave it to him.  Don't tell nobody to bid on it for $30.  That's ridiculous.  You can get them for $11.99 on MP3. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, there you go.  Go to mp3.com.  Joe Sondheim for a lot cheaper.  Type in Rotcut, and there it is.  In fact, all three albums are available.  mp3.com.  Yep.  All three albums, and most of the songs on those three albums are available for free  download.  Oh, look at that.  See, so you don't need to be bothering with eBay.  Joe, what do you do if you want to just hear maybe Anthony and his brother Joe perform  live?  Oh, you go down to Sgt. 
[00:33:30]  Pepper's Pub in East Northport on Jericho Turnpike this coming Saturday night.  Yes, Opie.  Are you showing up this weekend, Opie?  I can make an appearance, sure.  That'd be cool.  You've never seen the cover band, though.  No, I've seen you guys do the cover thing.  Yeah, we do all kinds of covers from everything, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s.  I saw you guys do it at Watch Hill a few times.  It's fun.  We all get drunk.  We play music, and we throw up at the end of the night.  It's great.  It's a great time.  And you can watch Cowbell Bill fall off his drums.  Yeah, Cowbell Bill plays the drums. 
[00:34:00]  Foot, my buddy Foot, is a keyboard player.  He's been on the show a lot.  Yeah.  So, like everybody, it's everybody you know from the show.  So, drop on down.  Sure.  Drink some Jack Daniels.  Cool, Joe.  And Budweiser.  All right, Joe.  That's mp3.com.  Remember that.  Yeah, I recommend Primal Side.  That's my favorite rock gut, too.  Oh, cool.  The ears did.  But shanking in the yard is pretty cool, too.  Shanking.  Shanking him in the yard.  Shanking him in the yard.  That's a little more like Kitty or Slipknot. 
[00:34:30]  Or a little Slipknot.  Yeah, that was my crystal meth days.  All right, fellas.  All right.  Cool, Joe.  Talk to you guys later.  All right, man.  Bye.  You're good.  There you go.  Get him from my brother, Sheeper, mp3.  All right.  Back to the paper, Anthony.  Yeah.  I'm pretty disgusted at this whole thing.  That pregnant nurse, the doctor that she was banging, got her pregnant, and then sticks  her with this abortion drug.  Yes. 
[00:35:00]  So she aborts the fetus.  So she's saying no.  She's going to try to have this kid.  Because I guess the married guy didn't want to ruin his marriage, have to pay out a portion  of his salary for child support.  So he figures, I'll stick her with some needles.  She'll have an abortion.  And I'm through with it.  The guy's out of his mind.  He's obviously out of his frigging mind.  I'm not siding with the guy on this, so don't get me wrong.  But this woman is a selfish slob.  Have the doctors terminate this pregnancy. 
[00:35:30]  They're saying that with this drug, and she got like five times the normal dosage from  this guy, it causes some radical birth defects.  You're supposed to take this one drug and then take another drug that aborts the fetus.  This one just screws it up so much that the woman's like, whoa, get this out of here.  This is a disaster.  It's like a two-headed frigging silkworm.  So the odds of her having a normal kid right now are very slim. 
[00:36:00]  Slim to none.  Slim to none.  It's slim that it'll even live, but it might.  And, you know, my own opinion here, I'm thinking maybe she might want to have this kid, no matter  what condition it's in, so she can get the child support from this doctor.  Because he's making a bloody fortune, I'm sure.  Right.  Right.  So I'm thinking, you know, if it's a head on a respirator with an arm sticking out where  the neck is supposed to be, it's my baby and I love him, or her, whatever it is.  I can't even tell, but it's worth 17% of this guy's income. 
[00:36:30]  I think it's very selfish of her.  And don't give me the God thing.  Because she says, I'm leaving it up to God, and she's religious, and that's why she doesn't  want to have the abortion.  She's so religious that, one, she's already divorced.  And, two, she's banging a married guy.  So I don't think the religious thing really holds up too well.  I don't know.  I think she's being selfish.  A head.  There's going to be a head on a respirator. 
[00:37:00]  A baby head.  How long is she right now?  Two months.  Two months.  They say it could take up to a month before they even figure out if this thing is human  anymore.  That's...  Oh, my God.  Bring back the freak show.  You know what that thing's going to look like?  It's going to look like a pickled punk.  Worse than...  A pickled punk.  Worse than thalidomide.  When they had the kids come out with the flippers.  Remember that?  You laughed.  That was a tragedy, man.  This is insane. 
[00:37:30]  The flipper kids from Canada.  They...  You ever see that documentary on TV about the flipper kids from Canada?  The thalidomide babies?  Thalidomide, man.  They told all these ladies that the drug was safe, right?  Is that how it goes?  Yeah.  It used to be used to prevent miscarriages and stuff.  You know, if a woman was at risk, she'd lay on her back.  They'd give her some thalidomide and the kid would shoot out with the fins.  Amazing.  They all had flippers. 
[00:38:00]  Like a big sea lion.  Oh.  So they got rid of that drug.  Lickety split.  And now they got some new fun drugs.  Man.  She taught her just to have the abortion.  Greed.  Well, I got a song queued up here, Anthony.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Which one is this?  Oh, you better just take a listen.  I can't be a dad. 
[00:38:30]  You bitch, I've been had.  Punch your stomach.  Trot wires, they got stuck.  Your c**ch is bleeding.  Hangers in your uterus.  Oh, stop your crying.  I think I hooked the fetus. 
[00:39:00]  Want to kill the fetus?  Just once.  Yank it out of their c*****s.  Police.  D&C.  Suck out little toes and knees.  Zack.  Zack, Zack.  Can't hear the little bones crack.  Lose.  Tin juice.  Gonna pull it till it comes loose.  D&C.  Wow, that's great. 
[00:39:30]  That's an anonymous contribution.  We don't know who sent that in.  No, we don't.  We don't, man.  Yeah, the Bergen record has a headline of the day.  A bunch of people have emailed us about this.  The headline reads,  Jets grow, I ain't gash.  Jets grow, I ain't gash.  Gash.  Yeah, Sam Gash.  Yeah, that's great. 
[00:40:00]  We're trying to get Sam Gash on the Jets.  He plays for the Bills.  But the headline goes, Jets grow, I ain't gash.  Today's Bergen record.  I love when they get fancy with the headlines.  Very good.  All right, and we've got to take a break.  We'll regroup.  We'll be back.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7 is our phone line.  Actually, let's give some away as we go to break here.  Can we give away the filter tickets still?  Yep.  All right, we've got a pair of tickets to see filter.  They're playing Thursday at the Hammerstein Ballroom with Veruca Salt.  Tickets available through Ticketmaster. 
[00:40:30]  I think we're going to try to get filter on our show in the very near future.  We'll give a pair of tickets to the 10th caller, 2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Man, fuck your butts.  Man, fuck your butts.  Man, fuck your butts.  Opie and Anthony, more stupidity is on the way.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  I resemble that remark.  That's the OK Terrific guy, Anthony.  OK Terrific.  OK Terrific.  OK Terrific.  OK Terrific.  OK Terrific. 
[00:41:00]  OK Terrific.  OK Terrific.  That's right.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  Coming.  Coming.  Virgin.  I guess Scott Muni commented about us playing his voice on our show.  Virgin.  Today?  Yeah.  He said bitch on his show today.  On his little show over there.  That said something like if another radio show wants to use that, he can. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  Or he can or whatever.  Feel free.  Bitch.  Feel free.  Bitch.  Unfortunately, Scott, so we can't record you on another station and use you here.  Nah, we get in trouble.  So we have to paw through years of tape to try to find more cuts of Scott's up.  Where's Psycho Mark?  Because they found a tape of Scott Muni.  Remember the big blackout of 77?  19 or 18?  The blackout of 1877.  The blackout of 77.  Remember the city was in just complete turmoil? 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  I was just a little taut.  I guess they found like audio of Scott Muni like broadcasting from the Empire State Building?  Scott.  Is that true?  Yes.  What was the tape saying?  I don't know.  Jimmy found it.  It was in the archives.  Okay.  Yeah.  And remember the big blackout of 1977? 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  You wouldn't remember that because you were living somewhere else.  Wow.  I heard about it.  Mm-hmm.  Anyhow, they had to, naturally the whole city was shut down.  I guess they had some backup.  The whole city was shut down.  There was looting and rioting.  It was great.  Rioting and raping going on.  That was before Giuliani had everybody corralled in.  He'd have the cops out on the street like in two seconds with automatic weapons.  That was an opportunity is what that was.  Shopping spree, they call that. 
[00:43:00]  The shopping spree of 77.  Yes.  God damn.  But the funny thing is, I mean, this place, I need a TV.  Give me a break.  There we go.  Oh, look at that.  That's a nice thing in Macy's window.  I'll grab that.  This place had its priorities all mixed up, though, because people are looting and raping  and shopping.  I have to get on the air.  So he went to the transmitter on the top of the Empire State Building.  Is that the truth?  And wanted to tell everyone that the rock and roll will continue playing on any W. 
[00:43:30]  I'm just amazed.  Wait a minute.  If it was a blackout, the elevators didn't work.  You're telling me Scotso walked up 86 flights of stairs?  I don't know how they got him up there.  Come on.  They had King Kong carrying him up to the transmitter.  Climb up the outside.  He's broadcasting from this room.  It just sounds like this big, giant hall.  Really?  I don't know what he's doing.  This is Scotso here.  And I wanted to remind everybody out there that we are still playing music.  Oh, yeah.  You still get the best rock and roll. 
[00:44:00]  Even when the society as we know it is crumbling outside.  Below me.  Even anarchy needs a soundtrack.  Want to thank Patrick Ewing for carrying me to the top of the Empire State Building?  Oh, Salomeo.  Oh, Salomeo.  It's coming. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, my God.  Here we are.  It's a total anarchy outside.  But we're here bringing you the best in rock and roll.  Scott Muni, the soundtrack of Disaster, outside.  We're going to try to get to some Pink Floyd. 
[00:45:00]  Bullets just riddling my studio here.  Two for twos, they must go on.  Go find that.  Here it is.  The Beatles on N.E.W.  British Biscuits. 
[00:45:30]  Bringing you British Biscuits.  Whoa, that was a low one.  Blackout down on the streets  I mean that in more ways than one 
[00:46:00]  Little racial joke by Scottsdale  Complete chaos, but we had our rock and roll back in 1977  Lights are up from the top of the Scott Muni building  Oh man, is that funny  I gotta get to the Empire State Building  People need their rock and roll  It's two for Tuesday 
[00:46:30]  On N.E.W.  The Beatles  Revolution N.E.W.  I remember when John Lennon came into this very studio 
[00:47:00]  And boom!  That one came through the window  Excuse me while I return fire  No one's taking Scottsdale out  Yeah, it's gonna be alright if you listen to Scottsdale on N.E.W.  Let me just pick a few off from high atop the Empire State Building 
[00:47:30]  Let me get my high powered rifle  Look at that one with the TV  There it goes  Playing your best rock and roll music from the Beatles  And picking off looters from high atop the Empire State Building  Hey, Leroy  Where rock lives  And looters die  Hold on, I think we actually found the 
[00:48:00]  This is the real thing  Oh, it is?  Wait, you got the real thing?  Really?  We're going into the N.E.W.  Archives  We like to do that from time to time here  On the O.P. and Anthony Show  So this is actual tape of Mr. Muni  Broadcasting live from the top of the Empire State Building  During the blackout, right?  This is it  Okay  1977  77  Let's take it back a few years  It's coming? 
[00:48:30]  Alright, here we go  Coming  They just threw the dad in  Here it is  Whoa  That's Cat Stevens  And we're at our transmitter site  Scott Muni here at WNWFM in New York  And if you are just with us  You already know what's been going on  For these  Whoa  These many hours  You know  The city  We're back on the air  Which is kind of nice  Although  Many parts of the city 
[00:49:00]  Do not have power  At the moment  We are in a room  That is  One we're unaccustomed to  Equipment  We're unaccustomed to  And all  But we will be doing music  And we will be giving you information  At this moment  There is the possibility  That up until midnight  Many parts of the city  Will not be back to normal  There is a possibility  We may not be with you either  Because if they lose power again  We will disappear  I have a small microphone here 
[00:49:30]  And a  Personal problem  A small turntable  And just a new setup  Where we are able to talk to you  And tell you we are back on the air  After many hours of absence  Not due to anything else  Other than  Another historical event  For New York City  That will be written about  And talked about  And  Motion pictures made about  Albums  And there will be a song  Someone right now  Is writing this song  Or already has written it  About  Twelve years after the first one 
[00:50:00]  Here in 1977  The blackout of 77  Which of course wrote  All the records  Of the previous blackout  And it is warm  And we have music for you  We are  WNAWFM in New York  If you would like  I think it might be a nice idea  To tell some of your friends  Since we are  Sort of a family  If you will talk to your friends  Since telephones are working  And say  NAWFM is back on the air  And we do intend to give you 
[00:50:30]  All sorts of news  What is going on  What's going on now  Is a lot of people  Are talking about  What happened  Or why it happened  And  And why  You know  Things didn't work out  What the hell is that  At any rate  We will have music for you  And we'll do some more  Hello Sarah  Connect me to Mayberry  That's the telephone ring  Wow  Now we're back on the air  77  And  We might lose power 
[00:51:00]  Pretty much the whole city  Didn't have electricity  And Scott Muni  Still had more of an audience  Than our old morning show  Absolutely  You say we got a revolution  Fire trucks  Rolling past  The backup studio here  Or  N-E-W  Carnage in the streets 
[00:51:30]  Look like a  Butcher truck overturned  But we're playing  The Beatles  Because we have to do  What we have to do  And  Hey  Hey  Hey  Drop  Drop that amplifier son  I have to transmit here  Don't be trying to steal  Scott's  Those equipment  I'll bust a cap  In your ass  And that  That scene's  Not going to be  Hit for another  Ten years  It's going to be 
[00:52:00]  All right  All right  Yeah  All right  Wow  Look at that  A little piece of history  There's more  Priceless stuff on there  I'm lit  Scott's  New York  New York is black  But I'm lit  N-E-W  That's the rumor  Yeah  That they were  Magnum  Champagne in one hand  And a Magnum  Pistol  In the other  I'm ready  For the blackout 
[00:52:30]  Hey  I can't see  Earl  There's no lights on  Earl  Could  Could you smile  So I can see  Yeah  Where's Earl  We must say though  When we first got  To N-E-W  Scott Muni  Was very  Very cool to us  He was the only  Cool guy here  One of the  Pretty much  On the air anyway  One of the few  That were  Cool to us  In the beginning  Scott so  So this is a

[01:01:30]  Yeah  We go through like  Four or five newspapers a day  We read I don't know  Ten to twelve magazines a week  Except yesterday  Except for yesterday  Well I was in a lot of pain yesterday  I don't even remember  Doing a radio show yesterday  You know we surf the web  And print out stuff  And a lot of this stuff  Never makes it on the air  It's just a pile of crap  Yeah  But some of it is worth  Going through  So I want to go through  The crap file  And get some of this on the air  The crap file 
[01:02:00]  Yeah because look how big this is  The crap file  This is all stuff  We were supposed to do on the radio  All this stuff  Yeah  Wow  And it's a little of everything  Like there's a wacky story  That we found  Wacky?  Wait a minute  I don't even know  Where we found this  It's a wacky horn  But let's get it out of the way  So we can throw it in the garbage  And move on  It's a story  From the American Journal  Of Forensic Medicine  And Pathology  Back in 1987  It's a story  About a concrete enema  Anthony  Oh 
[01:02:30]  We should have put this  On the radio months ago  Right  Let me read the story  Okay  According to the journal  A 20 year old man  Came into the emergency ward  Complaining of rectal pain  Anthony  Ow  Seems he and his boyfriend  Had been fooling around  Four hours earlier  Hey  And after stirring up  A batch of concrete mix  The patient laid on his back  With his feet against the wall  At a 45 degree angle  While his boyfriend  Poured the mixture  Through a funnel  Into his  Balloon knot 
[01:03:00]  After the concrete mask  Hardened  It became so painful  That the dude  Sought medical  Care  Under general anesthesia  The  Wah wah  Was dilated  And  And some catheters  Were inserted  Alongside the rectal mask  To relieve  Suction  So they had to get this 
[01:03:30]  Hardened mess  Out of there  Yeah  Okay  A happy bouncing  Baby chunk of concrete  Was delivered  Without incident  Oh you're very naughty  The patient was kept overnight  And discharged  No pun intended  The next day  The doc recommended  A psychiatric consultation  But the patient declined  And probably rushed back home  To stuff  Wow  A dog up his balloon knot  Coming  Coming  Coming  So there you go  A quick story  From the  American Journal of Forensic Medicine 
[01:04:00]  And Pathology  From 1987  Anthony  What the hell  Why would you even do that  I don't know  I don't get it  At all  There's something with  But it has to be real  It was in the  American Journal of Forensic Medicine  And Pathology  Oh yeah  Of course  I don't know what it is  That's gay people  Always trying to find  A new  New  Gay  Sick  Whether it's  A little gerbil  That they put up there  And then 
[01:04:30]  And it fires out  Of their butt  Yeah  That old  Gay  Oh the  In retrospect  Lighting the match  Wasn't a good idea  Wasn't a good idea  We've all gotten that email  Yeah  Yeah we've seen that one  And what's up with that  Everyone is gay these days  Yeah everyone's gay  Everywhere you look  Everyone's gay  Hey  Hey  Is it hip to say  You're gay these days  Be quiet son  In the paper today  Elizabeth Taylor  Is outing James Dean 
[01:05:00]  Saying he was  A pillow biter  Well  What  James Dean was one of her  Neighbors or something  No she said he was  He was one of her  Gay pals  Along with  Rock Hudson  And  Marie Clift  And all that stuff  Rock Hudson  And Mark  Hmm  So now we're finding out  James Dean was  A pickle smuggler  Well a lot of people  A lot of guys  That go into the  Entertainment field  Are into the arts 
[01:05:30]  They're into  You know they started out  In the schools  In the plays  And stuff  And what not  And I think  Gay people  Gravitate toward that thing  More than straight people  You know what I mean  So it's  It's  I think it's safe to say  That a lot more people  In the entertainment field  A lot more men  In the entertainment field  Are gay  Than in  The regular  Working world  Hmm  Hmm  Hey 
[01:06:00]  Yes  Hey  Yes  Ouch  Ouch  Alright hold on  Let's go to Joe real fast  Joe what's going on  How you guys doing  Good  I love the show brothers  Hey thank you  Look I got something  Thank you brother  From the LA Times  96  That's a fake story  That's the one we were talking about  Oh no  The felching incident  So fake  That is so fake  Are you kidding me  It starts out  In retrospect  Lighting the match  Wasn't a good idea  No no no no no no  That had nothing to do with it 
[01:06:30]  And was it about a gerbil  Okay  It did happen  It did not happen  Well  He went to the hospital  The doctor  He went to go take a look  The man passed gas  The thing shot out  And broke his nose  Alright listen  That isn't even the right story  You are such a tool man  Joe  You are such a friggin tool  That's an urban legend  That stupid story  And he's like  The guy  The doctor  Went to look at it  And he passed gas  And shot the gerbil out  This isn't even the fake story  Of how it happened 
[01:07:00]  Don't know how many stupid DJs  Have read that story on the air  Claiming it's a real story  Like it was true  No  We've all gotten the email  It starts off  In retrospect  Lighting the match  Lighting the match  Wasn't a good idea  It was a gay couple  And they decided  To put a gerbil  Where the sun don't shine  Yeah  Next thing you know  They can't get the damn thing out  So the one guy  Lights a match  To see what he can find in there  Next thing you know  The other guy  You know  Had some gas build up  Yeah  The match lit the gas  Gerbil comes flying out  Breaks the guy's nose 
[01:07:30]  And people send this thing  All over the country  Saying I swear  It's a real story  Yeah here it is  In retrospect  Lighting the match  Was my mistake  Oh it says  It was my mistake  Now it's the burn unit  In the San Francisco  City hospital  When I read it  It was something  From the LA Times  I thought it was Vegas  Yeah  Let's see  He's in the emergency room  Attempted to retrieve  A rat  My son left the kid  Oh this is a totally  Different one  This is one where 
[01:08:00]  It goes up the exhaust pipe  Of a motorcycle  And it builds up  And shoots the rodent  Out into the guy's face  Come on  Get at it  But it starts the same way  Same way  Yeah this one  They were doing  The gerbil thing  And they were trying  To get it out  So one guy figured  He would light a match  To try to scare  The gerbil out  Or show him  Where the light was  At the end of the tunnel  And it ignited  A pocket of gas 
[01:08:30]  In the guy  And shot the rodent out  In flames  Right into the guy's face  And he suffered  A broken nose  And burns on his face  The other guys  Suffered rectal burns  And they try to present  This like it's a real story  Every time you read it  The city's a little different  Maybe the name's different  The newspaper's different  A little different  And you mean to tell me  At a  It says  And later at a press conference  The doctor said  At a press conference  Where was this press conference  I've never heard of a press conference 
[01:09:00]  About something like this  In my life  You show me the footage  Of the press conference  And I don't care  If 800 people  Come forward  And say they know the guy  They read the story  It's true  It is an urban legend  Did not happen  Fakey, fakey, fakey  Yes  All right  In retrospect  Indeed  I want to play  The Marlon Brando  Thing  It's real quick  Speaking of  Gay guys  Yeah  How about

[01:38:30]  You go off to a hotel  To get some banging  Going on  Yeah  Okay  You have this company  Call your house  Make them believe  It's a doctor's appointment  Right  And they even call your house  Confirming the doctor's  Appointment  Wednesday at noon  And instead of being  In the doctor's office  You're in some cheap hotel  Somewhere banging away  Right  This company will do  All this for you  They even take care  Of payments for hotels  Meals or gifts  Then bill your credit card  For car repair  Car repairs  And computer software  So you're out

Well, I mean, you know, you are, but, you know, I just, you know, it seems like, you  know, I'm a faithful listener, I've been listening since day one, and it seems like, you know,  you guys seem a little bummed out about what's been going on over there the past couple of  weeks, you know, and all that.  No, we're fine.  We're having a great week.  Yeah.  Like, last week was great.  Yesterday we played it, but.  I mean, today, it seems like, you know, playing a lot of recorded stuff and I'm not going to  have a problem with that, but.  Well, there's, you know, there's some laughs involved with today.  All right.  You know, personally, I mean, not to be selfish, I don't care if it gets indicated, because I got 
[02:19:30]  you guys here already, so it doesn't matter to me.  Yeah, well, don't worry about it.  That's for sure.  You guys keep it up, don't worry about it.  I don't want them, don't want them give you a hard time, all right?  Everything is fine.  All right, good.  All right.  Take care.  I just wish my back didn't hurt as much as it does.  Yeah, I hope some severe pain during the show.  It's like in a wheelchair.  Well, practically.  One of Jerry's kids.  I'm waiting for you to just wheel into the studio.  You know, you're a nice guy, though, because we're walking down the hall to, you know, get  into the studio to do the show today. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah.  And I am walking like an old man.  I'm not exaggerating.  He's hunched over, his arms are hanging.  I pulled out my back so bad, and I'm like just slowly but surely walking down the hall,  and I thought for sure you were just going to go, well, I'll see you in the studio.  Yeah, later.  But it's like, you know, visiting like a grandpa at the old age home, and you've got to walk  around the grounds with him a little bit, real slow.  That's what Ant was doing with me today.  I'm like, hey, he is a pal.  It's like when I went to, when I took my mother and grandma to lunch before the Broadway show, 
[02:20:30]  and like we had to walk with grandma.  Yeah.  And you walk, and then you realize, oh, we're walking faster than grandma.  You've got to slow down.  And you've got to really slow down.  So I'm walking to the studio, and it's like, oh, Opie can't walk.  No, I cannot walk at all.  I wanted to take a couple days off, but I thought you and Rick would kill each other.  And doesn't that suck?  Yeah, right.  That probably would happen.  Doesn't it suck like there's plenty of time once you get old to walk like that?  I said that to Ant.  Oh, great.  This is what we have to look forward to when we hit like, you know, 65, 70.  Imagine if you're walking like this. 
[02:21:00]  And you've got to bang some fossil.  You know?  Screw that.  Oh, my God.  Imagine that.  I screw that.  I guarantee I'll get hookers.  Guarantee I'll get hookers when I get older.  Opie's got line of the year.  What?  Talking about girlfriends and wives and everything like that.  Oh, well.  Did I say that one on the air yet?  I think you have.  I don't know.  It just puts everything in perspective.  Because you're talking about marriage and everything, and Opie's just like, yeah. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah, right.  Because I've had to listen to Anthony's horror stories the last few months, and I'm like,  you know what?  My girlfriend, or my wife, I should say.  My wife isn't even born yet.  Now, that's a way to look at things.  Your wife isn't even born yet.  My wife isn't even born yet.  And you'll laugh at something stupid like that.  But look at Michael Douglas.  He could have said that in his 30s.  Sure.  His wife wasn't born yet.  Right.  And it was true at the time.  Now he's got that piece of ass, you know, Zeta Jones there. 
[02:22:00]  Mm-hmm.  So my wife isn't even born yet.  Isn't even born yet.  I don't, I just don't want to wake up like at 70 next to like a fossil, where her private  parts look like a cow tongue.  Oh my God.  It's like hanging.  Like me?  Hey, we've all seen that picture on the internet, right?  When did my wife get a sack?  What happened?  So yeah, I'm in severe pain today.  Yeah, so you're walking around all hunched over. 
[02:22:30]  Jim, what's going on?  Hey.  Oh, hey guys.  What's up?  You almost killed me earlier.  Huh?  What happened?  I went off the road.  I was listening to the outtakes.  I was laughing so hard.  I had my eyes were tearing.  I'm telling you, man.  I went right up on somebody's lawn.  Ah, cool.  Oh, it was great.  Oh, that was so good.  Yeah, so funny.  Great.  It's funny unless it's you, you know?  Yeah.  Like Anthony's not laughing.  I'm always getting slammed.  Well, I don't make me look at it either.  I don't know what it is, too.  I think I psyched myself out.  I go into that studio. 
[02:23:00]  I really want to just blow through it and get out of there.  And I cannot frigging do it for the life of me.  It's like whenever we're doing a live read here on the air.  And Ope goes right before we're doing the read.  He goes, hey, Anthony, we've got a read coming up.  We've got to tape this one so we can play it when we're off next week or something like that.  But for the client.  So let's keep it to a minute and let's blow it out.  And it's like the first thing is like, I'm bending.  I F it up. 
[02:23:30]  I can't take the pressure.  I choke.  A lot of people want to know how I hurt my back.  I'm simple, just bending down.  That's all it takes.  Bending down to get a shirt out of my drawer.  That's all it takes.  That's all it was.  Well, we've all done it with the neck.  You're in the shower and all of a sudden you just like, I don't know, do something stupid like you turn your head  or you lift your arms to scrub your head with the shampoo.  And the next thing you know, you've got a pinched nerve in your neck.  It's like, what the hell is that about?  Yeah.  Ouch.  Yeah. 
[02:24:00]  But that's what happened.  Rick, what's going on with Bridget and her waxing?  Yeah.  All right.  She's ready.  She's here.  The waxing people are here.  Virgin.  And we've got the other studio set up.  All right.  Can we talk to Bridget real fast?  Yeah.  I want to talk to the two ladies that are going to be doing the waxing to.  Do they speak English?  Yeah.  A little bit.  A little bit?  Yeah.  Okay.  We can talk to them, too.  Jay, what's going on?  I just want to know, who the heck runs off the road because they're laughing?  Yeah, I know. 
[02:24:30]  All these people I call about that drive me crazy.  Listen, I've got something else, though.  We don't know if they're going to say that, you know?  Yeah, I know.  Listen, I've got a job for Spaz.  Yeah.  You guys have been way too hard on me.  Involves him working in a factory with Bugs Bunny.  Say that again?  Involves him working in a factory with Bugs Bunny.  Yeah, the bombs.  We give him a lug.  Right?  We give him a lug hammer, and he's got to tap the heads of missiles to see if they're okay.  Yeah.  Testing out the bombs.  Dud.  Writing dud on him.  Thanks, Dud.  You guys ride Spaz hard, but he does do a lot of great stuff in the show. 
[02:25:00]  One of the calls earlier where, oh, my God.  Well, we were proving a point there, Spaz.  You know, what am I doing?  Very well done.  He pisses off a lot of you guys, but he knows what calls we need for our show.  Yeah, absolutely.  Like, he wouldn't have accepted this one.  Well, I had to work it up when I got on.  I'm just kidding, Joe.  Great, guys.  All right, thank you.  All right, bye.  Any Bugs Bunny reference is okay by me.  Yes.  Bridget in the studio, Anthony, from Make Bridget Cry. 
[02:25:30]  Hey, Bridget.  She's back.  How are you?  Fine.  How are you doing?  We were able to talk you into getting your virgin bikini line waxed live on our show.  Right.  But you will not allow us to watch.  You can't watch.  This is a first.  It's like...  I was willing to back out.  Yeah, but we're wondering, like, you know, if we could maybe see a before and after.  No.  No.  Even just us so we could tell the listeners? 
[02:26:00]  No.  No.  Boy, she ain't budging.  How about just the hair that's going to be pulled away?  No.  How about just a little peek?  No.  To the top of the rough?  Nothing.  Nothing.  The top of the rough.  Nothing.  Nothing.  How about, like, your hairy legs?  They're not hairy.  No?  All right.  So what are we getting done today?  You guys want to say?  Okay.  What?  It's called a Brazilian bikini wax.  Brazilian bikini wax.  It's everything. 
[02:26:30]  Carnival.  Wait.  You're going wood floor?  I think so.  It's everything.  Right?  It's almost everything.  Almost everything?  What is left?  Except for what?  It's like a Playboy wax.  All right.  Wait.  We got the wax ladies in the studio.  It's like a Playboy wax?  Correct.  What does that mean?  She should be able to wear a g-string without showing hair.  A g-string without showing hair?  So is there a line of hair left?  Correct.  Okay.  So it's like a mohawk.  A little mohawk.  It's like a little triangle.  Oh, a little triangle?  Oh, you're going with a tiny little triangle? 
[02:27:00]  On top of the, yeah.  On top of the, uh...  Uh-huh.  Right.  That area.  Ah.  Right.  That's my...  The shape is whatever they like, they asking for.  Uh-huh.  It's a thing.  Because it means this shape.  You guys do a lot of this waxing thing?  All day long.  All day long, you're checking out, uh, bushes?  That's correct, yeah.  Oh, you're very naughty.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, dear.  The hair list, I love it.  Do you do this with young boys? 
[02:27:30]  Yeah.  Do you ever get disgusted at some of the messes that come see you?  Uh-huh.  No.  All the clients is beautiful.  All the clients are beautiful.  All of them.  I see.  No one comes there and wants a wax and looks like Fidel Castro eating a London broil?  No, no.  No, huh?  No?  And how is this done?  What do you use?  Wax.  Just wax?  Yes, pine wax.  Organic-y wax.  Organic-y wax?  Yeah.  What's organic-y?  It's made from pine.  Pine?  Oh, organic wax?  Yes.  Oh, so it's sort of like, what, sap? 
[02:28:00]  Kind of, yeah.  Mm.  How about that?  And you guys just rip it off?  Yes.  That's right.  Yeah.  Will she scream live in the air for us?  Well, let me tell you, there's a lot of guys that go down there, too, to get the back wax  and the chest.  Ouch.  Yeah?  Yes.  Ouch.  Mm.  Oh, my God.  Well, I really wish we could see at least part of the procedure, but she's...  Well, are you voluntary to get it done?  Well, no, no.  I don't want to have it done on me, no.  Could Rick be...  Wax my sack.  Could Rick be behind you where he doesn't see your ground zero? 
[02:28:30]  No, because she's going to be in a position that he can be there.  Oh.  No, she has to be undressed.  She has to be relaxed.  She has to be relaxed.  She's got to be undressed.  All right, can we have the wax strips when you're done with them?  No.  No?  We can't even see your hair after...  We've got to auction that off.  We've got to auction that off.  No.  Oh, my God.  You're like a prune, man.  Oh, you are so shy.  You're like a virgin, too.  I'm a man how she snuck in here.  How she wheeled in to get on this show.  I can't get my free wax. 
[02:29:00]  Wow.  So, you're going to take all her clothes off for this, or just their bottoms, or what?  Just the bottoms.  Just the bottoms?  Yeah.  Did you check out the area to see what kind of job you're going to need to do here?  No.  Whatever the job she needs to get done, she's going to be doing it on hers.  Yeah.  It doesn't matter.  She doesn't have to check.  Are you going to be waxing the taint today?  Yeah.  That's the whole area down below.  Right.  Yes, the undercarriage.  You're doing the undercarriage, too?  Yeah.  That's got to hurt.  It sounds light, but it doesn't hurt.  Yeah. 
[02:29:30]  It doesn't hurt.  It's worth a pain.  Yeah, the technique that we use makes something easy.  And how long will this take?  No more than perhaps 30 minutes.  30 minutes?  Are either or both of you lesbo?  No?  I'm thinking that would be a coup.  What a job to get into if you're a lesbo.  Say that again?  In my place, it can be in five minutes.  Yeah?  It depends, you know, like how much hair you are.  If you were a girl and you were a lesbo, wouldn't you get into this line of work? 
[02:30:00]  Would you just see all day?  Oh, yeah.  I would.  PJ wants to sniff the wax on line 11.  Oh.  Yeah, see, she won't even let us have the wax with her hair in it.  It's not even part of you anymore.  Why are you so shy?  But there's something about this.  She's so innocent and, I don't know.  Yeah.  Most girls we would blow off if we weren't allowed to check it out ourselves.  Virgin.  Yeah, that's why, Scott. 
[02:30:30]  Virgin.  Yeah.  Virgin.  All right.  Well, we're going to set up mics in the other studio so we can at least hear Bridget scream  when they pull the wax.  Yeah.  Do you mind a microphone?  Not at all.  Oh, thank God.  Yes, sir.  We can have the ladies explaining what's going on for our audience.  Yeah.  Okay.  Like you're applying the wax and, man, we'll ask you questions about, you know, what's  going on, I guess.  Okay.  All right.  We only have like a half hour left in the show, so we better get going.  So let's go.  Get cracking.  No pun intended. 
[02:31:00]  There goes Bridget.  She has a cute little sundress on.  What kind of panties are you wearing today, Bridget?  Yeah, what kind you got on?  What?  What kind?  What kind?  What color?  Can we see your panties?  It's a song.  Just pull up.  Let's see what color it is.  Just on the line.  Come on.  Let's see your panties at least.  We're getting you a free waxing.  It's like wearing a bathing suit.  Yeah.  Don't you wear a bathing suit?  What are you getting to wax for?  Who's going to see your waxing now?  Yeah, who is going to see this?  Who is going to see it?  You're not going to show us.  Who the hell are you going to show? 
[02:31:30]  It's like polishing up the Ferrari and leaving it in the garage.  Jesus.  You guys talked me into coming here.  All right, but who's going to see it?  You're going through all this pain and this effort.  You're going to see it.  This is just, and now are you going to wear a bikini this summer?  Yes.  So isn't underwear just like a bikini?  Yes.  So if we happen to be at the same beach you were at, well, we wouldn't see through it.  You pull it up a little.  Just show us the color of the, you can put your hand in front of the, you know, the patch 
[02:32:00]  area so we don't see through the.  I can't believe we can't even see your panties.  I can't believe you guys agreed to this.  I haven't had to beg this much since I told my little niece to keep it a secret.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Virgin.  Yes, God.  Maureen wants to know why you won't get it all waxed right off. 
[02:32:30]  Maureen.  Yeah.  Hey.  I don't know.  What's up?  I'm talking to you.  What's up?  No, I don't know.  Why didn't you just get all waxed?  What's the point of having a little bit there?  Yeah.  I thought it was all getting waxed.  I'm trying to wax.  Oh.  Well, maybe she wants it all waxed.  Maybe she's going to go for the wood floor, Maureen.  Yeah.  She's going for the wood floor.  Oh, yeah.  Really?  All right.  Good girl.  All right.  It'll still be fun because, I mean, we'll have them all on the radio explaining what's  going on. 
[02:33:00]  Right, Ann?  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Ladies, why don't you get going?  Why don't you get going?  Get started.  There go the ladies.  How'd you like to mow my lawn?  Yeah.  They'll be mowing her lawn.  How'd you like to mow my lawn?  Huh?  How'd you like to mow my lawn?  Huh?  All right.  I don't know why we keep inviting Bridget onto our radio show, but there's just something  about her because she's like...  You know what it is.  This virgin, this prude, this...  There's this hope, I think, that one of these days she's going to crack.  But she gets more and more conservative and prudish with each appearance on this program. 
[02:33:30]  Ben's all pissed.  We're all pissed.  Ben's like, what are you not supposed to say that?  Ben's like, Ben just said, effort, effort.  Right on mic.  And I don't think he was pissed off saying that.  That's so funny.  Oh, er.  Yes, she keeps up, like, dude, the hair that's left on the wax.  I mean...  Yeah, because she probably knows what's like a mark. 
[02:34:00]  I'll do it.  All right, how do we get him up in the...  Grazing off of that thing.  Keep it like a chia pet in his house.  Kid Rick, I want to know...  A little red chia pet.  I want to know how we get him up in the other studio, because we want to see what's going  on over there.  Of course, she's a natural redhead, also.  She's got that Irish red hair.  All right.  Yeah, nothing's going on in there.  They don't have the microphones.  They don't have the microphones on yet.  Retards!  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, so I guess we're hoping... 
[02:34:30]  Oh, I hear something there.  Uh, Rick?  Rick.  I hear the microphones in the other studio.  He can't hear us, though.  Yeah, what's up?  Hey.  Yeah, we hear it.  Where are you?  Are you in the studio right next to us?  No, I'm in there, too.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  They're in the studio that Don and Mike use when they're here, so everything's all locked  up, and the windows are all sealed up.  Rick, why don't you explain what's going on?  I mean, you can stay in there for a little while, I'm assuming. 
[02:35:00]  No.  Get out.  No.  Uh, Rick?  I don't get it.  Uh, uh, Rick?  Yeah, why don't you explain what's going on, because you can stay in there for a little  while.  Well, right now they're, uh, they're setting up like a, like a, like paper.  Like paper, like if a dog were to go to the bathroom.  Okay.  Like setting up the paper on the, uh, on the counter.  On the counter?  Yeah, because we're going to...  Hold on, you can't say that word. 
[02:35:30]  Okay.  Aw.  She's going to put her, uh, private area up on a, on a counter.  Okay.  Putting her, she's going to be parked on the counter.  All right, so they're, they're laying down paper.  Right?  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  That's where we're at right now.  All right, let, let's take a break.  Uh, once you give one of, get, you got to give the lady some head.  I'm going to get dressed now, but I have to leave?  All right, wait, before...  Hold it.  Hey, Rick, Rick.  You want to unzip her?  Rick.  Okay, Maggie's unzipping, uh, Bridget's, uh, little son. 
[02:36:00]  Rick's not listening to you.  I know.  No, I need to get in there.  Come.  Come, come down here.  Don't turn back.  Come on.  I can't hear you.  I hear it.  Why?  It doesn't matter.  The headphones is...  The studio's got to be set through.  Rick, don't turn around.  I'm just listening in.  I felt Earl, he's an idiot.  I can't hear anything.  Wait, don't start.  Earl, you're an idiot.  Yeah.  He can't hear anything.  He can't hear you.  All right, you guys there?  Earl?  Yeah, we're here.  All right, Rick. 
[02:36:30]  All right, listen.  We can't hear.  We can't hear.  Rick?  Oh, I'm going to punch somebody.  I'm in no mood for this today.  Can someone make a concerted effort to make this work?  Yeah, what?  Dude, all right, listen.  I got to...  We got to take a break.  We need the headphones for the girls so we can talk to them while they're doing this.  He's not even listening.  Yeah, he's not listening.  He's not listening.  Just turn them down.  We'll go to break.  All right, we're going to go to break. 
[02:37:00]  Tell them not to start because we got to get headphones on those women.  Tell them...  It's real simple.  Tell them to get headphones on the wax people so we can talk to them during the whole process.  Very, very simple thing to do, okay?  That's easy enough.  Oh, my God.  Like brain surgery.  Hey, it's fixed.  I don't know.  Are all...  What happened?  Make sure it's fixed.  We're going to take a break, and we'll be back.  Stay there.  Hi, this is Jim Brewer, and you listen to the new FM Talk 1027 NEW, Opie and Anthony, and 
[02:37:30]  they're part of my new class, and we gather every Tuesday, this is the first month, and  we talk about our past lives.  And I used to be a butterfly, and I'm flying away.  Bye, bye, bye.  Opie and Anthony.  A bunch of ladies going.  You guys are really funny and stuff, but you guys take it too far to the point where I  literally get nauseous and sick listening to your radio show.  Don't make a mitle.  1027 NEW.  All right, it's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:38:00]  We have Bridget from Make Bridget Cry in another studio.  She's going to get a bikini wax, Anthony, live in our show.  God only knows why.  She doesn't want anyone to see it, though, so she's locked away in another studio.  I think Rick's still in there, because she still has her clothes on.  Yeah, I'm still here, guys.  All right, what's going on in there, Rick?  Well, she got into the robe, and actually, I've gotten to the point where she's going 
[02:38:30]  to give us the wax strips with the hair on it.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I kind of convinced her of that.  All right.  So we'll have that for the O&A auction.  That's good.  That auction's going to be great.  Yes, it is.  All right.  We need various hair products.  And I can almost see a little move.  Oh, she's covered up.  Damn.  I forgot she's got headphones on.  All right.  So she's naked in a robe?  Yeah, she's naked in the robe, and the ladies have the hot wax heated up. 
[02:39:00]  Okay.  Should I leave now?  Is that the deal?  Yeah, let's give Bridget the microphone so we can talk to her.  Does she have headphones on, too?  Yeah, she's got headphones on, too.  All right.  And can the ladies hear us, the waxers?  Can the waxers hear us?  Yes.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  Bridget, how do you feel?  Bridget, how do you feel?  I feel fine.  We're just trying to figure out the headphones.  I want to use headphones.  You heard that? 
[02:39:30]  Yeah, I heard that.  All right.  So you guys got the hot wax ready to go?  Yes, ready to go.  And how do you apply it?  With, like, a paintbrush or with your hand?  No, come on, guys.  How come it's going to be with her hand?  Use a penis.  You are.  How do you apply the wax?  I'm serious.  She got, like, a large spatula that she used for that.  Like a tongue depressor type thing.  Right.  One of those ones that the doctors use when you go to sit down. 
[02:40:00]  When you say open up and say ah.  All right.  Is Bridget going to feel it when you apply the wax?  Of course.  Okay.  Because it's a little bit warm, you know?  Okay.  So why don't you describe what's going on.  And, Bridget, whenever you want to jump in, you're more than welcome, okay?  All right.  All right.  And also, describe her pre-waxed area.  Is there a lot of hair there?  No, there's not a lot of hair.  I'm not talking about you.  You want at least somebody else to describe your...  But Rick's still in the room. 
[02:40:30]  They haven't seen.  Rick, get out of there.  What are you, crazy?  I'm just setting up the last microphone here.  All right, Bridget, this is for you to hold on to.  Okay.  One second.  Okay.  This is for you to hold on to.  Now she can answer all your questions.  All right.  All right.  So let's start the process.  If they can hear me.  Yeah.  Rick, get the hell out of the studio.  Yeah.  Just talk.  Okay.  Rick's leaving.  Okay.  Rick's gone.  Now...  You don't want to.  Come on.  Come on.  Let's go.  Come on, Rick.  You got to keep going. 
[02:41:00]  Come on.  Tell Rick.  Lock the door.  Okay.  Lock the door.  Okay.  Here we are.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  All the ladies are in the studio.  That's correct.  Okay.  Now, describe Bridget's patch there.  Is it normal?  Is it a little hairier than normal?  Yeah.  What has she got down there?  I'm not looking at her.  Come on, Bridget.  Answer that question.  Oh, you're going to look.  You're going to wax her.  You're going to see it, right?  No, it's not me.  It's Johnny. 
[02:41:30]  Well, you'd let her talk then.  Yeah.  Johnny.  They want to know what it looks like.  Beautiful.  Oh, is it?  Is it a very hairy?  Kind of hairy, yeah.  Kind of hairy?  Yeah.  Kind of hairy?  Yeah.  Is it growing down her legs a little bit?  Come on, guys.  It is not growing down my legs.  Okay.  Are they applying the wax?  Baby powder.  Baby powder now.  How's that hymen look? 
[02:42:00]  Virgin.  Virgin.  Okay.  Coming.  Coming.  Coming.  It's really disturbing.  All right.  So you're applying the baby powder.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Very good.  Now she's putting on the wax.  She's putting on the wax.  How's that feel, Bridget?  It feels warm.  Okay, Bridget's losing it to a Yankee candle.  Just kidding.  Shut up.  All right.  They're spreading the wax?  Yeah, and she's putting the first strip on.  All right.  All right.  Aw. 
[02:42:30]  How'd that feel?  That was quick.  She's very quick.  All right.  Let's hear a few more little screeches out of you.  Okay.  Tell us what's going on.  Okay, she's putting more wax on.  Okay.  The warm wax?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then she puts the strip on.  Oh, yeah.  She pulls it off.  How does that warm wax feel down there?  It feels fine.  Yeah.  Does it feel good?  It feels fine.  Is it pleasurable at all to you? 
[02:43:00]  It's scary.  It's really scary.  It's scary.  All right.  How does it feel when she rips the strip?  So far, it's not so bad.  She's doing the outsides.  Okay.  The outsides.  I don't think they wax the inside, honey.  All right.  Aw.  Aw.  Hey, I kind of like the way that sounds, huh?  Okay.  What do you think?  I think we're moving closer. 
[02:43:30]  We're starting from the outside moving to ground zero, right?  Yes.  Okay.  All right.  Let's hear some more.  Okay.  All right.  Tell us what's going on.  Well, she's got one of my legs at a 90-degree angle.  Yeah.  She's letting her get more area.  Okay.  More wax is being applied?  Yeah.  It's on.  Yeah.  Okay.  This one should hurt.  Here we go. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, no.  That wasn't so bad.  Okay.  How would you like to mow my lawn?  Huh?  How would you like to mow my lawn?  Huh?  Virgin.  So you have a leg up in the air?  No, no.  Just off to the side.  Off to the side.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  All right.  How much have they done thus far?  I can't.  I don't know.  I can't really tell.  No?  They're getting really close.  Okay.  All right.  Oh, my God. 
[02:44:30]  What?  What was that?  That hurt.  That one hurt?  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  Oh, that one hurt.  Okay.  It's not that bad.  Ladies, how's she doing so far?  She's doing very good.  Very good?  She's a very good girl.  Are we halfway done?  No way.  No?  No.  So I got a lot left?  Oh, yeah. 
[02:45:00]  That is just the fun.  She has to do the back.  The back?  Yeah.  That was just one side.  That was just one side?  Yeah.  Virgin.  All right.  You're moving to the other side?  Virgin.  No, it's just going to get a hole.  Oh, that sounds pretty good. 
[02:45:30]  I believe we're deep into the forest.  At this point.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  She's getting there.  All right.  Yeah.  Going for a waxed floor in.  Let's hear.  Let's hear.  Okay.  She's putting the wax on.  Okay.  This one's going to hurt.  I can tell.  And she's putting the strip on.  Okay.  You have the eyes coming out.  Ow.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:46:00]  Oh, yeah.  That rocks.  Oh, wow.  That is so strange.  That sounds like a thick strip.  How does it feel to have, like, another person's hands down by your area?  That's the first time ever, right?  No.  Oh.  No?  Just say yes.  Yes.  Well, that's the first time with another woman that close.  Virgin.  Um, no.  Doctors.  Okay.  Now, what are they doing? 
[02:46:30]  Cheese.  I prefer to rip it out with my teeth.  That's why I wax all of my girls.  Hello.  How are you, Bridget?  Remember me?  I am Mike Tyson.  I am Mike Tyson.  I will wax you.  All right.  Here comes another one.  Are they going to, uh...  Oh, this one's going to hurt.  All right.  This one's going to hurt.  Okay.  She's putting the strip on.  Strip on. 
[02:47:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Coming.  Coming.  Coming.  Coming.  Coming.  Oh, wow.  Ha.  Ha.  Wow.  Coming.  Ha.  Are we almost done in the front there, or what?  Um, yeah.  Pretty much, yeah.  Ouch.  Ouch.  All right.  Are the waxing ladies still, uh, listening to me?  One is.  Yes, I am. 
[02:47:30]  All right.  Uh, how close are we to done?  Oh, my gosh.  This one's huge.  Oh, wait, wait.  It's...  This one's huge.  All right.  Hold on.  Wait, wait.  Hold on.  Be quick with that.  That's...  Ow.  That's the middle.  You know, that's why it hurts so much.  Ah, the middle.  That's right in the center.  Oh.  The good part.  Ow.  Oh.  I'm getting told to stop tensing.  No.  Remember that.  Nice.  Bridget, it sounds like it hurts.  It's...  It's...  Yeah, but it's quick.  It's not that bad.  Yeah. 
[02:48:00]  Okay.  I'm going to have a red manger last.  So, with another ten more minutes, she should be done.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Ten minutes.  Just in the front, or the whole thing?  No, they're doing the back now.  The back?  All right, what position are you in right now?  Like, I'm giving birth to the sky.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You're giving birth to the sky.  Your legs are up in the air, kind of?  Okay, this is really scary.  Okay.  They're putting wax on that area, though?  Yeah.  How close to the balloon knot on it? 
[02:48:30]  Right on it, I think.  Ow!  Oh, man.  That's great.  All right, we have a virgin getting her bikini waxed for the first time.  Ouch!  Ouch!  All right, so is the front...  Virgin.  ...the front completely done now?  Well, it works.  It's hot now.  Yes, it is.  Oh, you're very naughty.  Oh, my God. 
[02:49:00]  All right, what's going on, Bridget?  Ow!  Okay, I think she's almost done.  She's rubbing that strip on there.  This one should hurt.  Here we go.  Okay, she's putting wax on.  All right, more wax being applied to the taint, I believe.  Yeah, I think.  Wax on, wax off. 
[02:49:30]  Oh, no.  Oh!  Oh, yeah!  Oh, that one hurt!  Oh, yeah.  Virgin.  Virgin.  Oh, that one hurt.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wax on, hair off.  Virgin, son.  Wow.  That one hurt me.  Okay, just one more of those, and I think it's over.  The whole thing is done after this next one? 
[02:50:00]  I think so.  I hope so.  Wax lady?  Johnny, that's the last one?  This...  Oh.  No, it's not.  It is not.  Virgin.  Virgin.  Virgin.  Virgin.  All right, so what's going on in there?  Um, more wax.  More wax to the area, okay?  Yeah.  You're giving birth to the sky?  Ow!  Oh!  Whoa, that was a good one. 
[02:50:30]  This is how Bridget's going to sound when she loses her virginity.  This is great.  Only over here.  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Just like her first time, it's going to be, uh, it's going to be fast and it's going  to hurt.  Okay, this is the last one.  Okay, the last one.  Let's get a good listen.  Thank God.  All right.  Let's hear it.  Ow!  Ow! 
[02:51:00]  Ow!  This is what you ladies go through?  This is nuts!  It's not that bad.  It's not that bad.  Not that bad.  It is not.  All right, so, uh...  Because she's an heir, you know?  So, wax ladies, uh, what's going on?  Are we just about done?  Yeah, two more minutes.  Now, what do you do to, uh, as a follow-up to waxing?  Do you lotion the area?  Right, lotion the area.  Oh, you do?  Yeah.  Do you rub it in yourself, or does she do that?  Yeah, she would do that.  She does it, or you rub it in?  No, she does it.  She does it.  Wow.  Do you watch them?  The wax lady would do it. 
[02:51:30]  She wants to make sure she does it properly?  No, I'm not looking at that.  Well, you've got to make sure she does it right.  Don't want any, uh, problems.  I'm not sure she would...  Yeah, she would do it.  You know what the best way to apply that lotion is?  Oh, my God.  A big...  A big what?  She's putting astringent all over it.  Oh, astringent, so it's stinging?  Yes, it is.  It's a seabreeze.  It's a seabreeze.  All right.  You don't want a seabreeze.  It'll smell like it.  Let's hide. 
[02:52:00]  All right, so, so, Bridget, what's going on now?  She's putting seabreeze all over it.  It doesn't feel very good.  Yeah.  Is it all red?  It's pink.  Yeah.  It's all pink, Ophie.  How about that?  How about that?  It looks very cute.  Does it?  It looks cute, huh?  It does.  Can you show us the final product?  No.  Okay, terrific.  Can I get dressed now? 
[02:52:30]  I don't know.  It's up to the ladies.  Are they done with you?  They're done with me, I think.  Oh, okay.  So, you're completely, uh, bare.  Yes.  Get dressed, uh, Rick, go clean the, uh, hairs and the wax.  Wait, don't come in yet.  Oh, don't come in yet.  Jesus, perish the thought anyone sees, uh, precious Bridget naked.  Jesus.  Stop it.  Okay.  Jeez.  Oh, my God.  Oh.  Jeez, not bad.  All right, get your goddamn clothes on. 
[02:53:00]  Jeez.  Yes, that was very nice, ladies.  Virgin.  Virgin.  Oh, my God.  So, that's, uh, who's next?  One of the guys gonna do the back sack?  Who's nuts?  Oh, who's next?  Yes.  Yeah, what do you do when you wax the guy?  What do they always ask for, sack?  No, the back.  The back?  Oh.  Yeah.  You never had any guy come in and wanted, uh, his, uh, genital area wax?  Yeah, but we don't do guys.  You don't do guys?  No, not that area. 
[02:53:30]  I have some back hair.  You do?  Yeah.  A little bit.  A little bit.  What about ass hair?  No, we don't do that.  You don't do that?  No.  So, how come you do girls, but, uh, you want to do the guy?  Because we don't want to mix the clientele.  Yeah.  Of course.  We don't have hair staff, though.  All right, why don't we, uh, get, why don't we get all the ladies back in the studio so  we can take a look at you guys, okay?  Okay.  All right, come on back in.  There they go, Bridget, the, the, 19, I think she's 19.  19-year-old virgin getting her first, uh, wax job. 
[02:54:00]  Her first wax job, 19-year-old virgin.  Keith, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  How are you?  I'll tell you what.  I did an about-face, man.  I got on the phone.  I wanted to tell you to get this girl off the air because, you know, she's not doing  that.  She's not letting you see nothing, but hearing her go through this makes it worth it.  Yeah.  Every little bit of pain, she deserves it, all right?  Didn't you like those little sleepovers, man?  That was great.  That's what she, that's what she deserves.  She should have showed you guys something, man.  Who's coming in and don't show nothing, you know? 
[02:54:30]  What is that?  Well, we're going to, uh...  And there's plenty of other girls, I'm sure, with wax, they'll show you everything, you  know?  Get you guys off a little something, you know?  We're going to at least see her hair embedded in the wax.  Something very erotic about, uh, listening to a, a young virgin getting her first, virgin,  wax job in another studio.  Yeah, one of these real little virgins, you know?  Vir, vir, vir, vir, vir, vir, vir, vir.  All right, we're back in the studio, Keith.  Virgin.  You're welcome.  All right, Rick is holding the, the strips.  Let me, yeah. 
[02:55:00]  Let's see, man.  Before me, I am holding the Shroud of Turin.  Look at this.  All right, let's see.  Open it up.  Lift one up.  Let's see.  Let me, lift up.  Well, come here.  Oh, my God.  Whoa.  Wow, you're a redhead.  Cool.  Look at that, dude.  Oh, my God, I'm going to get sick.  Why?  It's a puby hair.  Yeah, but there's all sorts of other crap mixed in with it.  No, it's just the wax.  Yeah, it's natural.  Wow, look at that.  That is bright red, isn't it?  It's like Bozo the Clown heading a leg lock. 
[02:55:30]  Not anymore, though.  All right, save those, Rick.  We will auction them off.  Well, don't save them near me.  The wax lady's not amused.  Sorry, Bridget.  I'd rather see those things actually on the girl.  Did you guys have fun in there?  Did you have a good time?  It was all right?  All right.  She was good?  Yeah, she was a very good girl.  That's pretty good.  Is her area nice, and would you consider her area pretty?  I didn't see her.  Would you consider her area, is it cute? 
[02:56:00]  Is it pretty?  It's normal?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They are normal.  It's a little smaller than most.  Normal.  Yeah?  Tight?  Oh, please.  Come on.  Come on.  Oh, come on.  Virgin.  All right.  We want to plug you, ladies.  Where could other ladies get the wax job?  Maggie and Jane, right?  Johnny.  Johnny?  That's how you spell Johnny?  Yeah.  J-A-N-E with that weird line above the E is Johnny? 
[02:56:30]  Mm-hmm.  All right.  It's the J sisters.  Is that true?  Yeah.  35 West 57th Street?  Yeah.  Oh, you're close to here, right?  Yeah.  35 West 57th Street, New York, New York.  Give them a call if you want to get waxed.  212-750-2485, right?  Right, yeah.  It did a very, very good job on Bridget.  Totally bald down there now, Bridget.  I think so.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Nothing down there.  I think so.  Smooth as a baby's ass. 
[02:57:00]  Right.  How about a quick look?  Yeah.  Well, no.  She ain't ever.  You know when you're talking, oh, and we've had some girls up in this studio, and, like,  you know they'll crack after a while?  Yeah.  Not her.  No, I don't.  It's done.  It's just fun to have.  Like, there is no way in hell she is even showing, like, upper thigh.  I know.  Amazing.  What could you show us?  It's got to be something.  What do you mean? 
[02:57:30]  Virgin.  What do you mean?  Give us something.  Besides what you're showing right now.  What's the most you could show us right now?  Yeah.  How about your butt?  How about, no.  Bend over and pick something up.  Yeah, just lift up your dress like it's a bikini bottom.  Right.  Right, ladies?  But it's not.  Jesus Christ.  Isn't that normal?  I think Ben's all pissed off.  Jesus Christ.  I think everyone's pissed off.  I'm sorry.  All right. 
[02:58:00]  Frank, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  How are you?  That was so hot.  Oh, my God.  I never thought I'd be into that kind of stuff, but I'm totally into SMN.  S&M, I just found out.  Yeah, the little moan screams were pretty good.  Oh, is she still in the studio?  Yeah.  Bridget, I make six figures.  I will make you so happy.  Where's the decimal?  It's where it's supposed to be, Anthony.  I didn't lose any money like you.  Okay.  All right, guys. 
[02:58:30]  Take it easy.  Thank you.  Bye.  Yeah, that was pretty good.  All right, Bridget, you're clean down there now.  Yep.  Completely shaved.  Done.  And we're not seeing any of it.  Jesus Christ.  No comment.  No comment.  Oh, whoa.  What do you mean by no comment?  She doesn't want to comment.  She doesn't want to comment.  Okay.  Thank you, ladies.  Thank you.  And I guess, good job.  We'd like to say, you know, we'd like to look and say, hey, wow, that is a great job. 
[02:59:00]  But we'll just have to take Bridget's word for it.  Yeah.  Jasmine, what's up?  Hello?  Jasmine?  Yes.  How are you?  I'm fine.  You're on the air.  All right, what's up?  Okay, I just wanted to say that I'm surprised that she wasn't screaming because when I first got  it done, it was painful.  I was screaming and hollering.  I think it's all the Prozac she's on.  It's amazing how she took it.  I couldn't even walk, really.  I didn't want to walk. 
[02:59:30]  Does everybody remember where Bridget first came to our show?  Yeah.  Remember this?  Her boyfriend, she was with her boyfriend.  She figured she'd give him a Hummer for Hummer Tuesday.  And after she was done, the boyfriend pushed her forehead, knocked her to the floor and  said, I hope you're, you know.  I always knew you were a little what?  A little what, Bridget?  A little whore.  A little whore.  This is the girl that the boyfriend pushed away and said, I always knew you were a little  whore.  And now she, like, totally clammed up. 
[03:00:00]  And it was the first time she ever, you know, tried to give one of those, right?  Yep.  Yeah.  All right.  It's like a little neck clam.  It's just like wham.  Can't get in.  All right.  Nothing in there.  Well, thank you, Jasmine.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Bye.  I think your boyfriend wrecked it for everybody.  Let's go to Tom.  Tom, what's going on?  You should have been recording.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Great.  This was beautiful.  I loved it.  But you messed up.  You got to remember, for the next time, have the girls number the strips. 
[03:00:30]  Why?  That way you can put it back into position again when you get it.  Oh, like, rebuild it?  Rebuilding it like a jigsaw puzzle.  You got piece number one fits into slab number B and lot number C and all of that stuff.  That's pretty funny.  There you go.  You guys are great, man.  I love listening to this stuff.  And I love that she got what she got, man.  She should have showed you, like the other guy said.  She should have showed you the jump.  All right.  Ah, well.  Well, thank you, Tom.  But it happens.  All right.  Be good, guys.  Ooh, look at the time.  Yeah, with that, we got to get out of here.  Yeah. 
[03:01:00]  Well, Bridget, thank you very much.  Thank you.  Ladies, great job.  Thank you.  The Jay Sisters, 35 West 57th Street, if you want to get your patch waxed.  Right?  Junk waxed.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  All the girls, though.  Thank you.  We got to get out of here.  We'll be back tomorrow at 2.  Don and Mike are next.  Thank you, Bridget.  Thanks a lot.  All right.  Bye.  There they go.  And we're out here, too.  And we'll see you guys tomorrow.  This is debauchery mania.
