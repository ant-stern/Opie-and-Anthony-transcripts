<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly off-tangent.  It began with comedian Jay Morris, calling in from an airport, detailing his frustrations with airport security repeatedly searching his bag due to oversized toothpaste and a police captain's badge.  He recounted a humorous story about Lady Gaga's meat dress and discussed his successful podcast, its number one debut, and his relationship with Kevin Smith.  His wife's appearance on the podcast to address rumors spread by Bobcat Goldthwait was also mentioned.  The hosts also discussed Jimmy Norton’s successful anti-social comedy tour and its Vegas billboard, their disdain for pretentious Starbucks customers, and debated the merits of different Led Zeppelin albums (settling on *Led Zeppelin III*).  Further discussion included Jimmy Norton's challenges with corporate gigs (particularly veterinarians), impressions (including Norton's Chris Sarandon impression), a humorous anecdote about heckling Eddie Trunk, and their differing opinions on airport lounges.  They also touched on Louis C.K., Colin Quinn's Emmy nomination and Twitter responses, and the Women's World Cup, focusing on humorous observations about the players.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to a crude and satirical critique of *Yo Gabba Gabba*, featuring offensive jokes and the playing of several clips from the children's show. Anthony Cumia briefly mentioned his involvement in the Casey Anthony case.  The *Yo Gabba Gabba* segment continued into the show's closing moments, interspersed with a discussion between Cumia and Norton about a book signing and fans giving them marijuana.

The show then transitioned into a rambling discussion about the anxieties of transporting marijuana, including creative methods such as "boofing" it. This segued into a discussion about the disturbing content found on some pornography websites, specifically graphic death clips interspersed with pornography.  The hosts, possibly with a guest, analyzed the infamous (and fake) scenes from "Faces of Death," providing a detailed, often humorous, frame-by-frame breakdown of the fakery involved.  This led to a debate about what constitutes a sport, sparked by Patrice's assertion that golf isn't a sport because it lacks a defensive element.  The discussion became increasingly absurd, with suggestions on how to make golf (and other activities like chess and swimming) into "sports" by introducing elements like midgets, landmines, exploding squares, and octopuses.  The segment ended without resolving the "is golf a sport?" debate.

Another segment focused on the ongoing debate about the definition of a sport, this time prompted by Patrice's assertion that skiing isn't a sport.  The conversation became racially charged, and included increasingly absurd hypothetical scenarios to qualify activities like skiing and golf.  Dane Cook and Bob Kelly joined the show in studio, contributing to discussions about hair loss, improv comedy, and Dane Cook's early stand-up videos.  The conversation included further discussions on gambling, documentaries (*Anvil! The Story of Anvil* and the Mike Tyson documentary), and jokes about Jews.  A McDonald's run anecdote also featured prominently.

A further segment featured Bobby as a guest.  Anthony recounted an encounter with a self-deprecating waitress, sparking a discussion about self-deprecation and awkward social encounters, including forgetting people's names.  This transitioned into stories about other comedians: a chef who gave them a free meal, a comedian who did backflips, a comedian with a lazy eye, and Matt Malley, who used a wheelchair.  They detailed various mishaps at gigs booked for Matt Malley, including a memorable junior high show with a principal’s introduction.  Further stories about comedians bleeding on stage and other bizarre encounters at comedy clubs were recounted.  A frank and graphic discussion about physical discipline of children, including their own experiences with spanking and other forms of punishment, followed. They discussed a proposed California law banning spanking children under three.  The segment concluded with a physical altercation anecdote involving Bobby, a Fiji water bottle, and a flat iron.

A segment heavily featuring listener calls discussed childhood discipline, particularly spanking, and reactions to parents' marital problems. Callers shared experiences of harsh discipline, including a father using Auschwitz imagery to scare his son.  The hosts shared their own experiences with their wives and frustrations of married life.  The segment concluded with a discussion and reaction to a viral video of a naked, racist man on a New York City subway car, including his racial slurs and the passengers' reactions.

The final segment analyzed a video of a police officer's response to a naked, belligerent, racist man on a subway platform.  A guest, Kenny (a former law enforcement officer), joined the discussion, analyzing the officer's actions and considering alternative tactical approaches.  This transitioned into a graphic and sexually suggestive anecdote from Opie about his experience with a bidet at the Bellagio hotel.  The conversation continued with crude and explicit jokes about bowel movements and bathroom hygiene, with Bobby heavily contributing to the vulgar descriptions.  Opie then discussed his research into high-tech toilets, again using graphic and vulgar language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  You want the worst, you got the worst, you want the worst of Opie and Anthony, you want  the worst, you got the worst, you want the worst of Opie and Anthony, the worst of Opie  and Anthony.  Jay Morris.  Jay Morris.  ¿Qué pasó, mijo?  ¿Cómo está?  Uh, bien, bien.  We got, uh, we got Lady Gaga in the house and Jimmy's going to be, uh, leaving to take  a picture with Lady Gaga. 
[00:00:30]  Is she covered in meat?  Uh, no.  I'm wondering what, well, I don't think you can wear meat in the summertime.  That's all I know.  Pretty close.  Is, is, is meat a wintertime, is it a fall spring outfit?  You look, you look silly, uh, wearing meat before Labor Day is what they say.  You don't want to, you don't want to look like a jerk wearing meat.  That's only two ounces.  Oh, shit, drug deals.  Actually, my bag's going through, uh, all right, three times the charm.  My bag's going through the X-Men machine three times because I travel with Cologne because 
[00:01:00]  I'm not a stinky fucking Romanian like everybody else at this airport.  Wait, you got to go through the machine three times?  Yeah, they just keep that being out.  And I had my captain's badge that Billy Mac gave me.  You know, I display it on top like a creep.  Yeah, of course.  Let me take my badge.  You probably recognize me from my police work.  Yes, Jay Moore.  And his police work.  Citizen's arrest.  You're familiar.  I'm like, well, I don't know if you sound like captain's badge. 
[00:01:30]  You know, many collars.  Many, many collars.  What the, what the hell's the problem?  What have they taken out of your bag so far?  My toothpaste was too big and now they're running it again.  Honestly.  Enough already with this shit.  It's been 10 years.  Enough.  I'm going to brush your teeth, motherfucker.  Don't make me.  Yeah, don't make me.  What's wrong with toothpaste?  You could be plastic explosives in there or something.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  How about you?  Well, that's your thing mine is.  Yeah, yeah.  See that?  Oh, that's great to say.  I'm sweating my balls off right now hoping they just give me my shit back. 
[00:02:00]  How are we doing on the honeymoor in Cologne?  We good?  I have no offense.  Japanese guy right in front of me.  Check it out.  That's all.  All right.  Thank you, sir, very much.  I appreciate it.  Are you done?  I appreciate it.  I can't even talk.  Yeah, I do a lot of arrests.  That's a thing.  Probably recognize me from my police.  What's the last night, Japanese guy?  You got your shoes on?  I do.  But I start taking them off like at the curb.  I'm like George Clooney up in the air. 
[00:02:30]  Hey, Jimmy, how's the anti-social tour going, my man?  I don't know yet.  We're done for the summer.  We may start up in September.  We'll have to see what everybody's doing.  Oh, good point.  I saw the billboard for you guys.  I was doing the Hockey Awards, and I saw your giant billboard in Vegas.  I got all fired up.  Yeah.  Every comic I love was on that show.  Oh, thanks, man.  Yeah, it was a great show, man.  Fucking me, Bill, Dave, and Brewer.  I think Brewer's in Europe right now doing something for OzFest.  Shut up.  Yes. 
[00:03:00]  Hey, I was at Starbucks this morning.  Have you guys noticed this new anal-retentive douchebag that wants his coffee?  120 degrees have you ran into this guy?  No, not yet.  Really?  I swear to God, not yet.  Jimmy, you love your, where's my coffee diva?  I've never noticed the temperature, though.  To me, the temperature's always just so.  Yeah.  What better way to let the rest of Starbucks know you have no control at any other aspect  in your life whatsoever. 
[00:03:30]  I see you.  When you're bossing around a Mexican barista with a hole through his lips.  Hey, do me a favor.  No, not you.  Not the white.  Hey, Pocahontas.  You gave me 215 last time.  202 and extra foam.  I felt like George Carlin.  I'm like, you're paying for foam?  Foam.  Where do the aliens come down and see all the neat things we've done?  Like, pay for fucking foam.  You know who, like, seatbelts his extra foam into his car and sticks his finger in it 
[00:04:00]  and suck it like a queer.  Fuck.  It is amazing, like, Starbucks, no matter how long the line is, they keep that shit moving.  It's like, they're like the Federal Express of coffee.  They're like, what do you got?  Non-cap, D-cap, yeah, yeah, got it.  What's your name?  Move it along.  Who's that asshole?  You, looking down at your phone.  What do you got?  You pull up in your car.  They just hand you a venti coffee.  You're like, what?  How do you know to you?  You were here a year ago.  I remember your face.  Come on, get out of here.  Move it.  I fucking hate the barista, whatever, that fucking knows the orders ahead of time. 
[00:04:30]  I hate that guy.  It's always faster, though.  Yeah, but fuck, why are you paying that much attention?  Your job sucks.  Well, what else is he going to do?  He smells like coffee.  You know, it really is like, at first they were like hipster douchebags, and then they've  morphed into, like, the best-looking people America has to offer.  Or the baristas, like, even though they've got giant holes in their face, they really  are the coolest people in town. 
[00:05:00]  Hey, Jay.  That's my coffee chunk.  Thanks a lot.  You guys have been great.  I like the coffee chunk.  Jay, I wanted to ask this question to these guys, but I'm doing radio with two guys that  don't necessarily like Led Zeppelin.  Here's the questions.  Very quick.  Led Zeppelin 4 or Led Zeppelin 3?  Uh, that's a tough one.  He kind of, he, now, you know I'm a weird guy, Opie, and you know I'm a list bully. 
[00:05:30]  So, I'm going to say three, only but, let me, let me, let me.  Correct answer, sir.  Correct answer.  Only by default, because I wore four out as a team.  Right.  I would say Zofo.  I never need to hear Stairway to Heaven ever again, and Battle of Evermore, I go, this  is retarded.  Yeah.  Like you're playing a fucking mandolin, singing about battles between goblins and gnomes.  Yeah, that's a bit much.  It doesn't matter. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, what are they doing?  All of a sudden, everybody's gobbling up their food or something, right?  I'd pick three over four.  No, Chip, you're incorrigible, Chip.  Oh, he really is.  Jay, Jay, your podcast really getting momentum there, as they call it, momentum.  Podcast number one.  Yes, more stories.  How do we get that on our channel?  I debuted on number one, and I was all excited, and they said Kevin Smith took me under his  wing.  Yeah.  He's the Suge Knight of podcasts. 
[00:06:30]  He really is.  I just hope that I'm Snoop and not corrupt.  Yeah, he's going to, at some point, Kevin's going to hang you out a window by your ankles  and start shaking you down for money.  But I was super excited.  Yeah, I hope so.  At his house, he hangs you out the window.  He drops you into a fancy pool.  Yes.  The thing with Kevin was, you know, on my Twitter feed, I was begging people to, like, figure out  to get me on a podcast, and everybody's like, have you tried Corolla? 
[00:07:00]  I'm like, no, I don't want to be on a podcast, stupid.  I want my own podcast.  And Kevin just answered the call, and I said, I don't know anything about electronics or  anything.  He goes, don't worry.  I'll send a guy to your house Saturday.  Just, all we need is content.  And I'm like, it's the perfect scenario.  It's free, so you can subscribe to it.  I never stop talking, and all Kevin wants is extra content.  I'm like, this is amazing.  People download me talking, and I never shut up. 
[00:07:30]  How long is your podcast?  Each one's about an hour and a half.  Last week, we had almost a two.  How many do we do for four hours?  Huh?  No, I'm sorry.  That's how much you should do is an hour and a half.  This four hour shit is stupid.  It's for the birds, I say.  It's for the birds.  For the birds.  Go ahead.  Sorry, Joe.  I like doing five hours, man.  I really do.  I honestly do.  Anthony, I bet the four-hour podcast goes the way of the dodo.  I bet you. 
[00:08:00]  Endangered.  Endangered.  But I was super happy, because I wasn't number one in comedy.  I was like the number one podcast.  Like, I was beating national public radio and, like, how things work.  Like, weird stuff I was beating.  People, from what I've read on Twitter, say it's hilarious.  They love it.  How many people are listening to it?  Do you get those numbers or no?  I don't have them yet.  They're getting them for me.  But I just know that it comes out.  You know, we did.  Two have been up so far, and they both just come out at number one. 
[00:08:30]  And then they stay number one for about three days.  They drop to three.  And then I think yesterday I was number two and number five still.  First two.  And the one, I got my first double album open.  I got my first Exile on Main Street podcast.  Because I was in my garage with Barry Katz.  Hey, ma'am.  Just talking about Last Comic Standing and how it can't be fixed.  Right.  And going through all that. 
[00:09:00]  And then my wife came in and broke down how Bobcat apparently has been, like, making the rounds.  And on stage saying that she dumped him for me, which is, like, revisionist history.  So, once and for all, my wife went on the podcast and broke down exactly how he broke up with her.  Oh.  But, like, nice.  Like, nobody said anything bad about the guy.  But I thought that was salient.  Why does he still care about you two?  Because he's a self-saboteur.  And if he admits that he broke up with her, he'd probably hang himself like David Carradine in the Philippines. 
[00:09:30]  Hey, where are you flying to, by the way?  Jimmy's had breakfast with my wife.  She's pretty delightful.  She is very nice.  She's very nice.  That's the kind of girl you cut loose.  Yeah.  No.  Yeah, she's very smart.  When you're, you know, when you realize you marry up, you've got to hang out to that.  Yes, you do.  I am in St. Louis.  I did a gig last night for the veterinary medical, I don't know the exact acronym, but it was for vets. 
[00:10:00]  Corporate gigs.  Veterinarians.  Nice.  2,000 veterinarians that want a fucking party.  Were they fun?  They were fun.  I can't do corporates.  I'm too dirty.  I know.  I had to redo my whole life just because I realized I was leaving that much money on  the table.  But look at you, Mr. Antisocial.  You cut out your own niche, Jimmy.  You're killing everyone around you, Leon.  Yeah.  You're not dying, Jimmy.  You're just linking up with other people who are.  Fucking four of us.  Jimmy's favorite impression of mine will always be Chris Sarandon from Dog Day Afternoon. 
[00:10:30]  It really is the beginning, middle, and end of impersonations.  It's Chris Sarandon.  We were doing everything.  Uppers, downers, screamers, blues.  Screamers.  What do you want?  I took a bunch of pills to get away from you, and now I'm going to go away on a vacation  with you?  He's the greatest.  Oh, my God.  His hair.  He's the best part of the movie.  Yeah, he really is.  And the cops snickering behind him.  Yeah, they're all laughing.  Oh, you guys are the best. 
[00:11:00]  I miss you guys, man.  Yeah.  When are you going to be in New York, man?  You've got to come by and say hi.  Hells yeah.  Everybody said something similar at once.  It was all similar at once.  It was all the same shit.  Come by and say hi.  Come by, God damn it.  Hey.  God damn you.  Oh, and let me set the record straight right now.  Yes, sir.  I adore Louis C.K., one of my all-time favorite comics.  Yeah.  My impression of Louis and Ricky Gervais was to do impressions of Ricky and Louis and point 
[00:11:30]  out the uncomfortability that I personally felt because I'm a fucking blabbermouth and  like to be the center of attention.  And my point was that it was a very odd room.  When Ron Bennington, Jimmy, me, and Opie can't land a joke, that's a tiny, tiny runway.  Yeah.  I've been rooting around that people are like, yeah, obviously he's jealous.  He's got a problem.  No, he's my favorite comic.  Those two are part everything.  Everyone picks apart everything. 
[00:12:00]  Those two had a chemistry going that day.  We were pretty much spectators.  They're friends, and we were spectators that day for the most part.  It was fine.  Opie, you're obviously jealous of Louis and his talents, otherwise you would have said that.  Yeah, same.  Well, I'm so surprised that our listeners would actually spin something.  That's crazy, Jay.  See, the difference is I'm used to not being on the radar of celebrities.  You get used to that after a while.  Jay?  Yes, sir?  In My Time of Dying or Cashmere? 
[00:12:30]  In My Time of Dying, not even close.  Thank you.  We're on the same fucking page today.  However, oh, by the way, Opie, you'll love this.  My podcast starts with Unchained.  Just shove it up Eddie Trunk's ass every week.  That was one of the...  It's Herman Edwards saying, put your name on it, because I'm obsessed with being heckled  by people on, you know, Corvette I-14 tells you you suck.  I gotta tell you, that was, that, I wish Anthony was here that day. 
[00:13:00]  That was one of my funnest breaks of the entire year.  I was on a cruise.  I wish I was here.  We were destroying Eddie Trunk's book because he would make these lists and leave off key  songs.  Yeah, he had the Iron Maiden list and he left off Run to the Hills and 666.  Yeah, both of them.  And I'm like, you're being too cool for the room.  No one does that.  I did hear that.  You did?  I heard it on a replay or something, but I did hear that.  And then he doesn't like Unchained by Van Halen.  I'm like, what's wrong with you? 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  And then all I said to Opie, they said, have you rock, just play it.  Just play the opening 15 seconds.  And then as soon as the guitar kicks in, everyone looks around smiling.  And then Eddie just slowly began to weep like the crying Indian in the literature.  I like that reference because it's current.  Yes, it's very current.  That Indian hasn't shed a tear in 30 fucking years.  No, he's too busy making money at a casino somewhere.  He's running a casino and fucking, there's cash by his feet.  Giant fucking bags of money are flying out a window at his feet. 
[00:14:00]  It's like garbage.  It's, yeah, dollar bills.  Did you say giant eggs of money?  Eggs or bags.  However you heard it, Jay, that's all that matters.  Hey, Jay, you got anything on the women's soccer?  Because I know you do sports and I know you fill in for Jim Rome a lot.  It's very difficult to beat radioactive women.  We were all posing for Sweden because, let's face it,  when they went into their celebratory pile, it was like about 40 masturbations. 
[00:14:30]  And, I mean, that was really crazy when the Swedish people were in that pile.  You know they were lesing out in that pile, Swedes.  I hope so.  How about, you know, it's funny.  They're like complete toehead blondes.  And there's like that one brunette.  And you go, whoa, whoa, who's this one now?  Who's the brunette Swedish girl?  I don't know.  They made you.  Wow.  Let's talk.  And then you get the Japanese.  And it's like, well, do you want to beat the hot chicks or the radioactive chicks?  Yeah.  I'm surprised one of them didn't, like, just quadruple in size and just start eating people. 
[00:15:00]  Where are you at with soccer, though?  You think it's exciting?  They try to tell us how exciting soccer is.  I don't get it.  I watch, like, Manchester United sometimes on ESPN 11.  Yeah.  And only because the crowd is so insane that I think to myself, well, this must be cool.  And I like watching it for a little bit.  And I like listening to the announcers.  I think they're funny because I don't know what they're saying.  But here's my take on soccer.  It ends a soccer game 2-0 or 3-2. 
[00:15:30]  If there was no goalies, it'd be 9-8.  Wow.  Good fucking point.  Yeah, motherfucker.  That's a really good point.  How many saves per game?  There's no more.  I'm going to get arrested in this airport, god damn it.  I think if the soccer field was smaller, I would get into it.  Like a Chelsea period, you just want those sweaty, uncircumcised euros crashing into the wall.  Yeah, that's what I want.  Exactly.  I know exactly what Opie likes. 
[00:16:00]  Now, what, are you just waiting for your goddamn plane there in one of those uncomfortable seats?  Or are you in the big lounge?  No, I don't go to the lounge.  It's for fucking alcoholics.  Oh, that's true.  Yeah.  Okay.  I'm always in the lounge.  I was just saying, let me finish.  Let me finish.  Anthony's in the Apple Club playing, excuse me.  I know the Bloody Marys are free.  Why am I paying for oatmeal? 
[00:16:30]  By the way, Colin's Twitter feed the last week has been one of the funniest things I've ever read in my life.  He's hilarious.  He will not break that character.  When he says, if I get nominated for him, I'm going to spin kick it out of the presenter's hand.  And then my congratulatory speech, I'm going to go, whatever, Trevor.  Then I'm going right to Grave Street.  Who that?  Who's the guy that won this?  You know who, homie?  Is it possible Colin can get nominated or is that done? 
[00:17:00]  I think he is nominated.  Colin got nominated?  Yeah, I think so.  I like that you guys are close.  No, I saw Colin Saturday.  I just, you guys don't talk about the basics?  I tweeted that he was nominated.  Oh, I didn't, uh.  And he had a whole page of tweets about the humble brag, like, oh, you know, it must have been a slow, uh, must have been a slow year.  I don't know what are you doing.  Colin was nominated?  Oh, good.  For what?  Best stand-up, obviously?  Outstanding writing for a variety music or comedy special. 
[00:17:30]  Outstanding writing.  Good for him.  Who's voice was that?  Sam Roberts.  Sam Roberts.  Young Sam.  Hi, Sam.  Hi, Jay.  Take him to the zoo, Rock.  Sam spent the weekend in Provincetown.  Of course he did.  Oh, wow.  And it was Bear Week.  I didn't realize.  Was it Bear Weekend or Bear Week?  Bear Week.  Bear Week.  Wow.  Sam had his asshole treated like an oil derrick.  Yes, sir.  Non-stop.  Non-stop.  There he blows. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  Sam, have you listened to my podcast?  Not yet, but I'm going to today, both episodes.  That's what I love about podcasts.  You can just catch up and have two episodes right there.  It's on the Smodcast website.  Or on iTunes.  Someone give me a fucking burn of this.  Go burn this shit right now.  I can't believe it's free.  I can't really listen to it because it's...  Jimmy, can you listen to your show back?  Like if you do...  Stand-up, you mean?  I'll listen to stand-up once in a while if I'm referencing.  I want to see how I did a joke. 
[00:18:30]  But in front of people, I never can.  But you'll just listen to that part.  You can't listen to an hour, right?  Nah, I try not to.  Like I listened to an interview I did a few years ago with E-Rock.  And I have such self-hatred for my voice and my fucking delivery and my inflection.  It's just...  It's enraging.  Jay, can we get your podcast on our channel?  I don't know how that works.  You got to talk to Kay Smith, man.  You got to talk to Shug.  You got to talk to Shug.  Well, Kay Smith fucking is on our...  You got to push that right next to me, really?  I mean, there's a whole fucking airport right next to me. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, you got to push all that shit.  Jesus.  Don't you know him on the phone with?  What?  Brooks and Dunn, dude.  Come on.  What's happening?  How do I get just some guy pushing like 40 bags?  Well, we got Kevin Smith's podcast on our channel.  What do you mean on your channel?  Like on 202 or 190?  Yeah, on the weekends, it's like the best of Kevin Smith or whatever.  Bro, that would be tight as hell if you get more stories about it.  Oh, shit, man.  That would be cool as fuck, especially if you don't want any money.  It's an easy one.  You don't want any money, right? 
[00:19:30]  I don't want any...  You know, all I want is more people...  At the shows.  Yeah.  That's all I care about.  Yeah, that makes sense.  That's all I'd like to hear about is potheads.  All right, we're...  Potheads.  Where's Bladder?  Where did Kevin Smith...  Where was that from, Anthony?  What did I just do?  That was Platoon, man.  Bonds.  Y'all talking about killing?  Barnes.  I'd like to hear about it, potheads.  Does Kevin Smith...  Does Kevin Smith own you, sir?  Well, no paperwork has been filed.  All right, we can get you on, then. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  It could be good for his Smodcastle or whatever.  I believe I'm, you know...  And this is in all respects, it's the show tonight that it's Kevin Smith.  I don't see anybody else on Smodcastle number motherfucking one.  What's up?  B.O.  Shit.  Y'all love life.  Y'all want to kick ass?  Six of you boys.  I'm here all about my lonesome.  We were just talking about what a great character.  Anthony, here's the thing in Platoon.  He really wanted them to kill him, don't you think? 
[00:20:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, right then and there.  It took me like 10 viewings to realize, oh, my God.  He really...  He wasn't picking a fight.  Please, someone slip my throat.  What's coming out of this?  He'd really had it with life.  And that's why he cries.  He goes, oh, shit, I don't owe you.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's like, why don't you fucking kill me, you bastards?  Don't do it, Barnes.  And there'll be J. 20 years climbing the fucking walls.  Shit, that's fantastic. 
[00:21:00]  You'll be very happy.  The last four minutes of that conversation was at a urinal with Koreans on the other side  of me.  They're like, what the fuck?  I'm like, don't worry.  I went on...  It's the island, not the peninsula.  Relax.  Hey, how's...  Actually, no.  Well, how's the peninsula?  How's the fatherhood doing, man?  It's good.  My wife has this annoying habit.  Whenever he cries, she picks him up to comfort him.  No.  I have a different tact.  I put him in his car seat, and I just put him in the bathroom and leave him there. 
[00:21:30]  That works.  Like, I can't make you fart.  I don't know what to do.  So, my wife says, you can't do that.  It's like almost abuse.  And I said, well, the seat is designed to withstand a fucking car accident.  I don't think it's going to hurt him being next to the tub at a Ramada.  Unless Patrice shows up and turns the hotel upside down and shakes it like the gorilla  in the Samsonite commercial.  What the fuck?  Oh, shit.  We actually did a little research and realized it was American Tourister. 
[00:22:00]  Really?  Yes.  All these years.  You know, it's too bad, because Samsonite, we are all wordsmiths a bit.  Yeah.  Samsonite is way better on the mouth.  It really does work better than American Tourister.  And no one knows what American Tourister is anymore.  So, just stick with Samsonite.  Fuck it.  Yeah.  Or I'll work into me.  Why does everyone say Samsonite, then?  I don't know.  Where did that start?  They just thought luggage and thought Samsonite, but it's always been American Tourister was 
[00:22:30]  the bag that the gorilla threw around.  Oh, Don Draper would be rolling around in his grave, Anthony.  Don Draper?  Yeah.  It's American Tourister.  People see American Tourister, but they're thinking Samsonite.  Ah.  Those are the good old days.  You slap your secretary on the ass, tell her, job well done.  And then she goes, oh, Mr. Draper.  The good old days.  How much urine would be all over Jimmy's body if he was a businessman in the 50s?  Ah.  Well, you could just do anything to those women. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  No lawsuits.  PM me or you're fired.  They were happy to just have their jobs.  Yeah.  So, I just called.  I missed you guys.  I called earlier.  I called a couple weeks ago, right when Casey Anthony, that was happening.  But you guys were obviously in the middle of it.  I wasn't.  Oh, yes.  I called it, by the way, right from the beginning.  You sure did.  Right from the get-go.  You sure did.  How long before she's at your house, Anthony?  I'm working on it.  As we speak, working on it.  I really think she needs a, they said she needs a safe house somewhere. 
[00:23:30]  Do you have any real angles on this, Ant?  Oh, yeah.  I've been scoping it out.  Isn't she in Columbus today?  Trying to find things.  There's certain places that they think she's with, not a distant family member, but kind  of separated family member.  Right.  In Ohio.  She's going to get a million dollars for her first interview.  Jesus.  Anthony says, I'll give you four dollars and a million inches of cock.  Yeah, I don't give a shit.  Of my kick.  Come on in.  Who doesn't want to spend the rest of the summer hanging out by the pool, you know? 
[00:24:00]  Even though, you know.  I want to be with Jimmy in the hot tub drinking bottled water looking at a slug.  That was what I did.  That was pretty much it.  It was a slug.  And the slug and I both just looked at each other and shrugged and then turned away.  I hear you.  I'm boarding.  I got to go.  See you, buddy.  All right.  Jay Moore podcast.

You have no idea what that is.  I saw him tweet something about that.  He has?  Right?  And do the puppet master.  What am I missing?  You're missing a lot.  Compassion?  Right?  Sobriety? 
[00:25:00]  Hope?  The puppet master.  Oh, okay.  Hey, hey, everybody.  It's Dancy Dance Time.  I love Dancy Dance Time.  From Gabba Gabba Hay.  Let's see who our Dancy Dance Friend is today.  Dancy Dance Friend.  I watch about three hours of this a day.  Oh, hey, everyone.  I'm Elijah.  Hi.  I want to show you how to do my Dancy Dance. 
[00:25:30]  We're all going to learn it together.  Oh, boy.  It's called the puppet master.  And this is how you do it.  We're all going to pretend that we have strings on our hands, our knees, and our feet.  Oh.  Are you ready?  Let's try.  Oh, no.  Raise your knee.  Raise your knee.  Raise your other knee.  Raise your other knee.  Raise your foot.  Raise your foot.  Raise your other foot.  Raise your other foot.  Walk in a circle.  Walk in a circle.  Do the puppet master.  That stinks.  Are you shitting me? 
[00:26:00]  Raise your knee.  Raise your other knee.  Raise your foot.  Raise your other foot.  Walk in a circle.  Do the puppet master.  Raise your knee.  Raise your other knee.  Raise your foot.  And what do kids do when they watch this?  They bounce on your lap.  Oh, not you, Uncle Paul.  I don't want to know from you.  Raise your other knee.  Raise your foot.  It always ends up with clear stuff.  They step on you, you know what.  Oh, my God.  The repetition is killing me. 
[00:26:30]  Raise your other foot.  Walk in a circle.  Do the puppet master.  Raise your knee.  Raise your other knee.  Raise your foot.  It just keeps going.  That's why I brought it up.  So you know my pain now.  Now imagine hearing this probably at this point 25 times.  25 times easy on this one song alone.  Yeah, I guess.  If you're watching.  For a 14-month-old, he likes it.  Now, let's go crazy.  What?  God, he pulls out a gun and just starts shooting them all. 
[00:27:00]  It's crazy.  Starts rubbing his dick on the puppets.  Go crazy.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Dang.  Everybody's dancing.  He's going crazy.  Oh, that was so much fun.  No, it wasn't.  Thanks for having me, guys, but I got to go.  Oh, they're going to beam him away.  Oh, what are they doing?  Oh, my God.  They vaporized him.  Yeah.  What did they do?  They executed him.  Yeah, Yo Gabba Gabba.  Yeah.  Biz Markie was on Yo Gabba Gabba.  What did he do?  They're good at coming up with songs that have four words, 
[00:27:30]  and then those four words are said over and over and over again.  I'm the beatboxer, Biz Markie,  and my cool trick is making more than one sound with my mouth at one time.  Check it out.  I'm Biz Markie, the human organ.  I'm going to do it for you one more time. 
[00:28:00]  Slow up.  Can you do that?  Where's the motherfucking two short?  Cool tricks, cool tricks.  I'm Biz Markie, and making more than one sound with my mouth is my cool trick.  Bye-bye.  You got me.  Oh, baby, you.  It's a good song.  It's great.  He was trending on Twitter yesterday, and someone said,  his mouth looks like he has Brontosaurus DNA. 
[00:28:30]  I fucking know.  He really does.  I don't know the exact tweet.  If you can find it real fast, Sam,  but someone tweeted that his mouth is so brutal that he must have Brontosaurus DNA.  I can't imagine having to watch these.  Oh, these kid shows are brutal, man.  I drove home from Soda's Point five straight hours,  and the kid is finally able to watch TV in the car, 
[00:29:00]  so it's the Yo Gabba Gabba over and over again.  Oh, no, no.  Yes, yes.  I can't imagine.  But we figured out, and we're going to try this next time,  we're going to throw Family Guy fucking shows on.  Might as well.  It's cartoons.  Cartoons.  He'll just watch the cartoons.  He'll enjoy that, right?  You better hope so.  Instead of singing these same Yo Gabba Gabba songs over and over again.  Yo Gabba Gabba.  And do the puppet master.  He did tweet something about that, but I had no idea what it was. 
[00:29:30]  You know what?  But that's it?  Wow.  There's a party in my tummy.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Is everyone coming?  That old gag.  There's a party in my tummy.  This Marky's mouth looks like he has Brontosaurus in his DNA.  There you go.  That made me fucking howl yesterday.  At a dis world.  That's funny, man.  See, there was one day I was staying over a house, 
[00:30:00]  and there was family and kids and stuff like that,  and I was watching something on television.  And then the mom just comes in and goes,  yep, click, click, click, click, DVD goes in,  and now there's, like, shit.  Fucking Bob the Builder or some shit came on.  Right, right.  And all I could think is, I was watching something.  Yeah.  You mean the kids didn't want to watch the fall of the Third Reich  while you were crying?  Cheese.  Cheese.  Yeah.  Cheese.

Now you're going to get to an old Alka-Seltzer commercial, which I remember as a child.  Wow.  Try it.  You'll like it.  I tried it.  Thought I was going to die.  Took two Alka-Seltzer.

[00:35:00]  six months, and now you've got it stuck right in my goddamn head again.  Well, all I have to say to you is don't bite your friends.  Oh, no.  Is there a song about not biting your friends?  If Sam was a little faster on the fucking YouTube, we would be all over this.  Don't bite your friends.  You got that one?  Oh, it's a TV version.  Another TV version.  You're not a good version.  Yes, Sam.  Hello again.  Hey, everyone's playing together right now.  Hey, who's the nice guy?  That's Lance.

Oh, my God.  I figured we could do something with this today.  This is...  I can't...

Doing their happy birthday song.  This is the happy birthday song.  Yeah.  Let's eat her ass.  Who, the one dancing in the back?  No. 
[00:45:30]  The guy on the guitar.  What does she sound like?  Missing persons?  Anybody else?  A little.  A little bit?  A little, yeah.  Why are you trying to come up with a new happy birthday song?  It's never going to happen.  And she's got her hairdo from fucking...  Yeah.  Blondie in 1972 or something.  Berlin.  Oh, yeah.  The singer of Berlin had that hairdo.  Yeah.  It's kind of a cool song, actually.  Say my breath away.

Yeah.  2.7 almost million views on that happy birthday video. 
[00:46:30]  Damn.  That's not my name.  That's not my name.  Play the Ducks song.  We don't have time to play it.  Everyone wants to hear so much.  I guess we're trying to move on, but this guy, Michael C.  Mike, he says, the best is the Yo Gabba Gabba song in the car episode where Fufa, that's  that pink thing that looks a little...  Fufa the dildo?  A little tubby.  Yeah.  The pink butt plug, I think one of you guys said.  Oh, pink butt plug.  Okay.  It is too fat to get the seatbelt to fit. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, shit.  And they sing, don't stop, don't give up, keep trying.  Keep trying?  Yes.  Do you have that one?  And then we can finally end the misery.  Keep trying.  Oh, he's having a hard time.  Oh, God.  He's trying.  Yo, Gabba.  We don't have it.  Keep trying.  No.  I got a bunch of babies watching it.  Oh, boy.  So I guess this is going to have a dead end. 
[00:47:30]  What?  The bosses are watching it?  Is that what you meant?  See?  Because they're babies.  Did you just mention the bosses?  For a second.  Oh, shit.  How long?

I think there's the one he couldn't find.  What's up?  I can't find it.  It's not there.  Oh, you couldn't find it, Sam? 
[00:48:00]  No.  You should try it.  Yeah.  You might like it.  Try it.  You'll like it.  You'll like it.  All right.  Pause this for a second.  The best part of the song is coming up.  Oh, yeah?  At the end.  Because then the little girl tries it.  And guess what?  Tries her father's gun that he left loaded.  She likes it.  Oh, really?  Sure she does.  Her voice will drive you fucking insane.  This is the worst one, by the way.  Let's hear it.  Hit it.  You might like it. 
[00:48:30]  Try it.  You'll like it.  Try it.  You'll like it.  Try it.  You'll like it.  Try it.  You're gonna like it.  I know it's new.  That's called Merman.  You've never tasted this.  You'll just have to trust in me.  Oh, boy.  Just give it a try.  Yeah! 
[00:49:00]  Try it.  You'll like it.  Try it.  You'll like it.  Try it.  You'll like it.  Try it.  You're gonna like it.  I licked my sweaty balls.  Try it.  You'll like it.  Try it.  You'll like it.  Stop talking and start sucking.  You'll like it.  Now lick my sweaty balls.  Try it.  Now lick my sweaty balls.  Now lick my sweaty balls.  I know it's new.  I know it's new. 
[00:49:30]  And you've never tasted it.  You'll just have to trust in me.  I'm gonna fuck you in a mouth.  You'll just give it a try.  Hey, what about the cheeks of my ass?  I like it.  I like it.  Oh.  I tried it.  And now I like it.  Oh, that's Laura Bell.  I like it.  I like it.  I like it.  I roll over and shut up.  I tried it.  I roll over and shut up.  I like it.  I like it.  Stop talking and start sucking.  I like it.  Stop talking and start sucking. 
[00:50:00]  And now I like it.  I'm gonna fuck you in a mouth.  You will be molested.  I tried it.  And now I like it.  I'm coming, you dumb bitch.  I told you if you tried it, you would like it.  I told you if you tried it, you'd like it.  Yes, now you have to go and pick blueberries.  Oh, God.  There's a little lick in my head.  I'll lick my sweaty balls.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Sirius XM. 
[00:50:30]  Hi, Opie and Anthony show.  Opie was out sick today.  He's out sick.  He's got a sore throat.  So, me, Jimmy.  Danny has been a joy at the board, per usual.  Danny, always very good.  And I got Florentine in.  And, of course, Kevin Smith.  And I'm joined by my co-host, Jimmy Norton.  With a mouthful of pretzel.  Yes, you are.  Call it pretzel.  We call it cum.  You silly goose.  We were talking about porno, of course, during the commercial break. 
[00:51:00]  It always goes to porno.  Where am I gonna be this afternoon?  Do it.  I'm signing a book.  It's a paperback, right?  If I don't say something about this signing, people get upset.  What happens now if fans bring you weed?  Do you take it?  Or are you doing that?  I don't know.  I mean, what is the protocol?  Could that be?  If a cop gives you weed?  No, cops really seem to like me in the city, man.  I will say that.  But NYPD are great.  Also, it's like, I may be acting like a teenager and as much as I'm enjoying weed, but I do  have the sensibility of a 39-year-old man where I'm just like, perhaps I should keep 
[00:51:30]  this someplace where it's not going to be viewed.  Well, because a lot of comics on the road, if any fans know that they do that stuff, that's  when they just come by and go, hey, I hear this for you, or you want to go smoke or whatever.  So, and comics always take them up.  They don't even think twice.  It happened to Opie at an appearance years ago.  We were doing a club in Massachusetts somewhere, and he comes out of the bathroom, guy shakes  his hand, and guy gives him weed, just gives him a bud in his hand, and I'm right next to  him, and I'm talking to a group of guys that turned out to be troopers. 
[00:52:00]  They were mass troopers.  And I just went, oh, and here's Opie, and his right hand, he's got weed in it, and then  the guys, the cops put out their hand to shake his hand.  And Opie kind of went like, and turned his left hand upside down, and shook it like that.  The awkward shit.  Because he just had a handful of fucking weed.  It's like the motherfucker couldn't have picked the worst time to hand me weed.  I don't know.  I mean, I guess, like, I certainly, I'm certainly very trusting of the fan base, but it's the 
[00:52:30]  one non-fan that I think I would be like, somebody slips me a wet or something like that,  and I'm like, ah!  That's why, like, when people bring me an open beer or something, or a drink at a bar,  I'm like, you know, ah, roofie in here, wake up, you're fucking me in the ass.  I do it even, like, when they hand you prepackaged shit.  I'm just like, they can sleep.  I mean, you'd rather be awake for it.  Yeah.  I'm asleep?  Come on.  Absolutely.  But also, you know, a lot of comics do it because they don't want to travel with it.  They're afraid, so they figure if they go to the town, they'll get it there, so they 
[00:53:00]  don't have to worry about going through security and everything.  That's a new part of my life.  A new addition to my life is, like, the hour or whatever it is I spend every new city I go  to going, okay, where am I going to secure?  Yeah.  Got to procure.  Never had to worry about that before.  Just go places and then leave places.  Because you don't want to, like, what, go over state lines or travel?  Well, you're flying, I guess.  Yeah, obviously.  You just don't want to fly with anyone like that.  Even in a car, too, it's a little.  Yeah, I mean.  You use the old.  House, dude.  I'm a house bug.  That's the German tactic in Russia.  We won't take supplies.  We'll just get them as we go along, as we invade. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, we're positively.  So that's what you're doing with weed, and then you realize.  Positively brushing.  I got nothing.  I can't get any weed.  They did the scorched earth policy and smoked it all on me.  Yeah, I never thought of that, though.  You smoke weed and you're fucking traveling around.  You're screwed.  Oh, yeah.  A lot of guys.  Some guys will take it.  They'll put it between, you know, between the balls and the ass.  Stick it there.  They boof it.  They boof it.  And go through security instead of putting it in a bag.  I'm smoking it from there.  Then they insert a straw along.  It's a little musty. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah, yeah.  It's a good mushroomy flavor.  Little onions.  Little onion marijuana.  Yeah, it's great.  What were we talking about?  Let's go back to the porn.  The porn stuff.  We were just talking about how years ago.  We did a whole bit off the air.  Off the air.  It was ridiculous.  It was really good, too.  Should have just turned the mic off.  Let's relive it.  Yeah, we'll relive it.  We'll pretend we didn't do it the first time.  We'll do the Clifton Sperger.  We were just talking about porn and basically how it's tough now to surf through some places  like efuck.com or something like that.  Yeah.  They'll have lots of porn clips.  As always, they've had porn clips interspersed with horrendous death clips. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, I don't like the death shit.  The fucking, here's somebody cut in half.  Here's a woman who was thrown through the windshield and now she's got half a head.  Or a guy that was hit by a train and he's still alive cut in half.  Right.  And meanwhile, it's sandwiched between, you know, the best blowjob footage you're ever  going to see.  I want to click on that, but I'm getting these little thumbnail views of carnage.  And I don't want my porno mixed with that kind of grotesque death shit because I really 
[00:55:00]  think that'll fuck you up.  You're not looking for surf and turf.  You want a one dish only.  One.  That's it.  That stuff stays with you.  That which is seen can't be unseen.  Right.  You'd be surprised when I could find it.  Porno, I love.  I'll watch it.  I'll watch the blowjob footage.  The chick will get the cum right in her face.  It's great.  I move on.  And then I don't think about it.  The death shit, you go to bed and you're like, that motherfucker was like writhing around  with his intestines out and he knew he was dying. 
[00:55:30]  And it's like, Jesus Christ.  Fuck it.  It stays with you.  Jason Mewes watched an execution online.  And I was like, what was it like?  And he was like, don't watch it.  No, don't ever watch it because I'm sorry I watched it and I can't shake it.  Can't take it back.  And that dude never says shit like that.  Right.  You know, I would expect his response.  It was fucking awesome.  He was just rattled and shaken to the core.  It's a and it was a long distance shot, too.  But still, he was just like, I was I was I was also saying how you get like this post 
[00:56:00]  traumatic stress syndrome.  Why couldn't you get that from watching videos like that?  These horrible death videos, because some people just can't.  Some people can't take it.  You never watch faces of death when you were a kid.  It was your pants around your ankles.  Yeah.  Just that monkey brain part.  I would just fucking unload right on that.  We didn't know it was fake back then, though.  Right.  I mean, I thought it was real.  I totally know it was fake.  So fake.  It was fake. 
[00:56:30]  Why are you why are you winking at me, Jimmy?  It was fake.  It really was.  The whole thing was fake.  How did you know?  How did you know?  The only real guy admitted it after Michael Gross was not really a doctor.  He was played by an actor.  I'm a doctor.  Francis B. Gross.  The only real shit in that was the news footage.  Like they showed one of those plane crashes in San Diego where there were body parts on  rooftops and shit.  That was real.  What about the monkey in the tables?  Not real.  Fake.  The lion attack.  Fake.  Wait, wait, wait.  I'm stuck on the monkey in the table.  I saw them hammering its head. 
[00:57:00]  No, you actually didn't.  Really?  You saw a spinning monkey.  I did.  Then you saw them hammering, but not the monkey's actual monkey head.  Punch it up.  We'll find it.  Why would they do that?  And then because they wanted a shock.  Because they're dicks.  And people still bring it up now.  I mean, look, on one level, I'm delighted because for years that monkey haunted me.  I mean, that's why I smoke weed because of that monkey.  That fucking little monkey.  It hurt me as a child.  I was like, this poor monkey.  Why won't anyone save him?  No, it's so fake.  I don't want to hear that, dude.  And I believe for like the better part of 28 years that they killed and ate that monkey's brain. 
[00:57:30]  Everything was fake in that movie.  Really?  It's terrible.  Watch the alligator attack.  Alligator attack is fake.  They pan away from it.  It's so...  We watched it recently.  We were just laughing at how bad it was.  There's the monkey brain thing.  Monkey brains.  See the waiter?  That's actually Skip Stevenson.  What?  From real people?  Yeah.  All right.  Now they put the monkey in the middle of the table.  There it is.  Our fine.  A little cage.  And now they slide this little monkey thing to Griffith's head in there.  And look how unhappy he is.  He's terrified.  The monkey is not happy.  He's spinning around.  Oh, man. 
[00:58:00]  And now they're supposed to take turns, I guess, bashing the monkey over the head.  Yeah.  Until his head cracks open.  Then they eat his brains.  Yeah, watch.  Here they go.  Now they...  See, he's instructing them how to crack the monkey's head open.  Uh-huh.  With the little thing.  And the monkey's spinning around.  He's doing little pirouettes.  And they've handed them all these little mallets.  And now they're ready.  See?  Look.  Oh.  See?  Oh, look at this clever direction. 
[00:58:30]  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  See?  And it never even occurred to me as a child.  How fake is that?  Rewind.  If you...  That's actually the...  Why would faces of death cut away from footage?  Yeah, exactly.  Rewind a little bit.  Watch how fake this one guy next to us's arm is.  Watch.  Yeah, when he goes for the hit and he pulls back.  He blinks hard while he does it.  How fucking fake is that?  It's fucking professional.  When did they get to the brains?  Even when they cut back to the monkey, there was no marks on him. 
[00:59:00]  They already hit it 17 times.  Nah, he was fine, little guy.  Now it's a total fake monkey head.  Rubber.  Little rubber monkey head.  Look at how rubbery that is.  There's no blood.  And wouldn't his nose be bleeding?  He'd have a little monkey nose bleed.  He'd be all fucked up.  Go to the alligator attack, too.  That might be a real monkey, but a dead one.  Go to the alligator attack.  Go to the alligator attack.  It's so fake because they cut away from the actual attack when it happens.  And they just show, like, pandemonium.  There's something happening and you don't know what. 
[00:59:30]  Pandemonium.  Yeah, and there's a lion attack, which is the same thing.  This makes me reevaluate everything.  Everything you've ever known.  I don't even know if I like girls anymore.  Everything I believed about myself to be true is now a question.  What age did you think pro wrestling was?  Did you find that it was fake?  What?  I thought it was real until I was, like, 14.  And then when I found that it wasn't, I was really annoyed and I stopped watching it.  I was angry.  That was one of those things as a kid that I picked up on pretty early.  You did?  I did.  Sam Holland, my friend Sam Holland loved it and so did Ernie O'Donnell.  And I remember watching it being like, you know what happened? 
[01:00:00]  Clearly, they're playing archetypes here.  Yeah.  Right?  But at age 11, you say archetype.  And they're like, get out of here, faggot.  And I'm like, I mean, these bad guys.  It was all plausible deniability they had.  It was like, all right, we'll say it's real.  And no matter what you see, no matter how bad it looks, we're still going to tell you it's fucking real.  And you'd be like, well, they're saying it's real.  They couldn't do that.  I was fucking nine or ten.  Of course I believed it.  They said it was real.  I believed them. 
[01:00:30]  And it looked real.  What is it?  We're looking for an alligator attack.  No, Dan, this is outdoors.  Wait, let me see.  Go back.  I'm sorry.  Let me see.  I don't know what that is.  Just turn it towards me.  I got to tell you, I'm really happy, though, that that monkey.  Yeah, that monkey's fine.  He's probably dead now, though.  I don't know how old monkeys are, how long they last.  But I hope he got a lot of residual checks for that flick.  Yeah, he's sitting at his house.  That was me, spinning around.  You know how many takes I took?  Jesus Christ.  Director was a pain in the ass.  What they had was a device under me that would spin me around.  And you didn't see that.  I was getting pulled by ropes either way. 
[01:01:00]  But this was before fucking green screen, too, my friend.  I liked how they had a two-camera shoot for that monkey scene.  They had one inside and then one out.  One below the table and then one on the reaction shot for the woman that was disgusted.  She put the napkin up to her face.  Like, oh, they didn't tell her you're coming here to clobber a monkey and eat its brains?  I didn't know this would happen.  Oh, my God.  I thought we were having pasta.  You can't find it, Dan?  Oh, well.  What's your favorite porn now?  I go to a site called Submit Your Ex. 
[01:01:30]  Submit Your Ex.  Oh, I like that.  You know, that?  It's in one of those, well, it's a quasi-revenge porn site.  They write a lot of, they do all the write-ups for them.  And it's like, supposedly the people sent them in are just like, this is Rachel.  She broke my heart, so fuck her.  You know, a lot of shit like that.  But a lot of it, I believe, is just homemade, you know.  I love something.  Is it any real porn chicks, you think?  It could be.  But I mean, now it's like, there's a mixture out there of true, like, you know, amateur  or home camera, camera phone shit. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  And now the porn industry is trying to duplicate it.  So you'll find shit where you're just like, well, this feels quasi-real, but it's not very  real.  You can totally tell.  Like, I like, the videos where the chick is just going like, hi, Philly, this is just  for you.  You told me you wanted to see me, and there she goes.  She's obviously in her room.  It's like a bedroom with the fucking little stuffed animals and shit.  Yeah, little teddy bear on the bed.  You just know it's, like, they don't dress a set like that in a porno. 
[01:02:30]  It's too perfect.  Right.  It's girls' room.  And there she is, just unloading these great tits and fucking ass like a snare drum.  This is the real one you're talking about.  Yeah.  That's how you know the real one.  Yeah.  And then they're like, okay, bye.  Click.  They're really fast.  They're short.  They're quick.  And that guy must have got it and been like, this is great.  And then the breakup comes.  Fucking bitch is going all over the internet.  Yeah.  That's the only lesson I'm trying to impart to my child.  Oh, boy.  Chris Rock always talked about keep her off the pole.  Keep her off the pole.  Yep.  That's not it.  Now it's just like.  Keep her off the net.  Keep her off the fucking net. 
[01:03:00]  Don't take pictures, man.  That doesn't go away.  Yeah.  Or if you take the pictures, you hold the pictures.  Every digital version of it, it's your camera.  He can look at them while you're there.  Even then.  Treat it like the Declaration of Independence, where it's like,  somebody out, you go into a room, it's set on a desk, and you look out and analyze it  while somebody oversees you.  It's so ridiculous.  Someone goes to grab it and falls down a chute to a vault.  Or no head in the picture.  That's the key.  That's true.  A body shot.  Look at Rob Lowe back in the day.  Freaking prancing around.  Didn't even give a shit. 
[01:03:30]  There you go.  But there's lots of that on that site, man, where you're just kind of like,  I don't know if this is real or not.  But they look very natural.  You can tell by the camera work sometimes if it's too professional or if they have an angle  that they shouldn't have.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's true, too.  There's no way there should be that fucking across the room angle.  So one camera shoots just to it.  I hate when you're in the middle of it and you're in the middle of jerking off,  and then you're like, oh, this is fake.  I've got to stop this and I've got to go to another clip.  And it makes a big difference.  Yes, it does.  It really does.  Authentic is just more exciting.  Authentic is true.  Because you're like, I'm not supposed to be seeing this.  When this was made, they were not thinking of me. 
[01:04:00]  It was personal.  It was fucking...  They were in love.  And actually, when you look at it, it's not the mechanics of watching two people fuck.  Because it's like, we've all seen that.  What I'm into in those clips is I'm looking at the room.  I'm like, what kind of poster are they got?  Yeah, yeah.  What are they reading over there?  Like, how come they haven't changed it?  Look at that blanket.  It has a Coors logo on it.  It looks like Circa 79.  And they still have it on their bed?  Maybe they had a sponsor.  That's what I think.  There was one picture, because I look at it a lot, and there was one picture I found of a chick. 
[01:04:30]  And it was a homemade porn shot.  And she's sitting there, like, pulling up her shirt and pulling her shorts to the side and showing it.  In the background, hanging on the wall, Mallrats poster.  Really?  Oh, fucking cool.  And I was like, woo, the best of both worlds for me.  That's great.  I saw this girl, and she was in a college dorm room, obviously.  She's masturbating with a hairbrush.  As you do.  It's fantastic. 
[01:05:00]  So she's just going at it.  And girl-next-door kind of look, which is great.  I hate the fucking porn star, bubble-headed blonde, big fake-titted thing.  It's all turned around.  It's gone back to a common man.  Yeah, regular girl's rule.  And then I look behind her.  She's got, like, a bulletin board.  And there is an address and a phone number and pictures of what I can only imagine are her family.  Wow.  Like, behind her, it's like, dude.  I've seen images like that, too. 
[01:05:30]  What are you doing?  We're seeing too much in their private life.  Look at your shot.  Unless you've got a real short depth of field where, you know, it's amazing.  I had no idea how crisp I could focus on this camera.  This is terrible.  Yeah, you try to look at it real close.  You know what?  I would jerk off to the mom, too.  Let me zoom in on this.  I was telling them before that there was a picture I found the other night where, you know, submit your ex.  There's a site called Submit Your Mom, which is like cougars and milfs. 
[01:06:00]  Wow.  And then Submit Your Flicks, which is like people with the cameras.  I already wrote them down.  There you go.  Totally free.  Once again, a free site.  And they'll run, like, 20-minute clips.  You can watch a whole movie and shit.  Grab popcorn.  It's amazing because you used to have to fucking pay through the nose for memberships and this.  And maybe you'd get a still picture thumbnail would be all they'd give you.  Yeah, you couldn't even blow the picture up.  It wouldn't even get up.  Yeah, it would be all pixelated.  You'd see one pixel as a vagina.  And everyone has an amazing camera now.  So they're taking pictures that are 120, you know, megapixels or whatever like that. 
[01:06:30]  Really.  And, you know, you see the image on the page.  And it's small.  And if you run your cursor over it, you see that it could.  Yes.  And when you see that magnifying glass, you sit there going, okay, here we go.  Let's see how deep we're going.  And you give it the click.  And sometimes it just pops a little bit.  And you're like, oh.  But sometimes, dude, it just fucking, you are in the room all of a sudden.  It's so wide.  You're surrounded by this image.  And you're in it.  It's like when Harry Potter puts his face in the pensive. 
[01:07:00]  Suddenly, you're in that moment where they took that picture.  And in this picture, there's a chick.  She's like, I would say, 42 or something like that.  Thin body and stuff.  But, you know, time's taking us toll or whatever.  Still looks way better than me.  She's spreading her ass and laying over the bed looking over her shoulder.  And that's the shot.  When you click on it, it goes so hyper large that you're looking at her ring piece, the brown eye, as if it's the size of a normal human eye.  When you can blow the picture up to, like, one equals one, where you're sitting, you're looking at an ass on a computer screen, and a man's hand is on the ass, and you match your hands to the man's hand. 
[01:07:30]  You're like, we are now at one per one proportion.  So I'm looking at that, and all of a sudden, I look closely, and I'm like, oh, you know, you've got the ring piece, the asshole.  Little grooves, of course.  You're supposed to get in there and clean the grooves.  She did not.  Oh, no.  Little, like, fecal remnants.  Really?  Flex.  I was so amazed, because I was like, this is awesome. 
[01:08:00]  This is so human.  It's real.  Nobody cleaned.  Nobody was like, hold on, we've got to clean the shit off your ass.  This dude taking a picture, either he didn't know or he didn't care.  He's like, this is so fucking dirty.  And boom, snapped it.  And then I was alone in my room, smoking a joint, staring at this woman's unclean asshole.  And I was just like, I love the internet.  This is amazing, man.  Like, I don't have to leave the room, and I'm interacting behind it.  That's like a great religious testimonial.  If they're like, how did you find God?  And the story starts off like that.  Are you a fan of that, Jim? 
[01:08:30]  A little fecal matter in there?  I prefer it to be, I don't mind a little bit of the smell, but I don't want to see, like, shit in there.  Like, if it smells a little bit, like, yeah, it's a little sweaty in there.  It's like, eh.  A little sweaty?  Yeah.  Or it's dirty.  A little dirty is good.  Do you find your ass smells like a chick's ass?  Same difference?  Like, sometimes you're in a chick's ass, and you're just like, oh, that smell.  And then every once in a while, like, you're sweating, rub your ass cracker or something,  and you're like, that smells like a chick's ass.  Nah, I, my, apparently, my dick is so small, I'm hung like a fucking broad,  so my ass smells like my pussy or something like that.  Your ass thinks you're a girl. 
[01:09:00]  I never saw a dick swinging past me.  Well, my ass is like, you know, reading my body, mass index going, he's got boobs, must be a girl.  Sweat like a girl through the ass.  Oh, God damn.  That picture was astounding, man.  I'm still thinking about that picture.  You gotta know where you are.  That's my next lesson for the kid.  If you're gonna do it, wipe.  Clean up.  Yeah, big time.  Baby wipe.  You don't want people fucking getting all freaked out or excited about this.  I saw a clip, um, do you ever, Bang Bust, we've all heard of.  Yeah, sure.  And that's, is that fake, you think, or real?  Has to be their adult. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, I think that's fake.  There's no way they can just film you without IDing you first, and then put you on the internet.  It's completely illegal.  Unless they get your permission later on.  Like, they could do that whole thing, and then afterwards be like.  Like candid camera?  Sure.  Yeah, totally.  Hey.  They had one.  She's sucking my cock.  Here she is.  I'm gonna fuck Fanny Flag in the ass.  Fuck Bory Amsterdam looks on.  Um, they have one I call, I saw called Bait Bus, and what it was, was a chick, hot chick,  gets the guy in, you know, they put a fucking blindfold on him and shit like that, and she's 
[01:10:00]  like, I'm gonna suck your dick so good, and he's like, yeah, do it, baby.  She goes down him and shit, backs away, the dude who was posing as the sound man, the guy,  slips over and starts sucking the dude's cock.  Oh, shit.  And the chick is like calling up to the dude going, oh, it's so good, and stuff, while  the dude stops, and he's like, oh, I love it, I love it, and shit.  But it goes on for a few seconds, and they're like, take the blindfold off, he takes it  off, he sees a dude sucking his dick, and he freaks, but he doesn't, like, try to punch  anybody, that's why I thought it was fake.  Because a dude, like, the way he was portrayed, he was so testosterone-addled, like, if that 
[01:10:30]  happened to me, I'd be like, why'd you do that to me?  Yeah.  A dude like this would shoot you in the fucking head.  Would fucking kill you.  Yeah, yeah, totally.  Trying to make me gay?  Yeah, what are you fucking up?  You know, he's like the dude in American Beauty at the end.  Like, he goes to kiss him, and then suddenly shoots him in the fucking face.  But how many times, I mean, it's always like a hot chick walking in the middle of a neighborhood  by herself.  Yeah, yeah.  I've never seen that ever.  There she is.  All right, let's see her.  Yeah, there's her.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  A creepy bus just going, like, five miles an hour. 
[01:11:00]  You don't think the chick's gonna run?  Yeah, no doubt.  Hi, you wanna come for a ride?  Okay.  Okay.  Where are you going?  Who are the Negroes?  Okay.  Who are the Negroes?  Who are the Negroes?  It never happens.  You're listening to the worst of the Opie and Anthony show, Sirius XM.  All right, listen, let's get into this for a minute or two here.  Bill from Waterford on the instant feedback.  Patrice, how is golf not a sport?  You compete against other players, and there are no judges involved.  No, you don't compete.  You physically exert yourself, and you need skill to hit the ball into the hole in the 
[01:11:30]  fewest amount of shots.  That's Bill.  Then you got...  Bill...  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Bill's stupid.  You get Smokezilla from WackBag.  Any event that you can participate in and be eligible to draw a Social Security check  should not be a sport.  Good call, Patrice.  Golf is not a...  I was sitting there, and I've been listening to this argument that the sports guys have  been having lately, trying to figure out who's more dominating at a sport than Tiger 
[01:12:00]  Woods.  Is it right now?  Is it Roger Federer?  Tennis dude, right.  Or was Michael Jordan the most dominant per...  Golf is not a sport, and I'm going to make it very simple, my argument.  It is not allowed to be a sport unless there's defense.  That really sums it up.  Golf...  And that includes other sports now.  I'm not saying it's not skill, but you have a very good skill that, thank God, your hobby 
[01:12:30]  can make you money.  Your hobby.  Tiger Woods is the greatest hobbyist that ever played, because it'll be a sport if somebody  was actually coming out to try to prevent you from using your skill.  You know, you make a good point.  Do you understand what I'm saying?  That's it.  I grew up as a basketball player, and if there was no defense, I probably would have been  the greatest NBA shooter of all time.  How could they...  How?  Of all time.  If...  Listen, golf is a mental game. 
[01:13:00]  Tiger is mentally better.  He might be physically better, which gives him advantages to hitting it further.  He works out.  I'm not saying it's not a skill, but it's not a sport, because can somebody stand there  and go, hey, Woodsy, hey, half-cheeky black dude, what the... what you doing?  Oh, Tiger sucks.  Boom, boom.  As soon as you do that...  They get thrown out.  Yeah, as soon as you do that, they throw you out.  Sure.  You have to shush.  All right.  All right.  Yeah.  What would make it a sport, then?  If somebody came out and tried to...  Tackle him? 
[01:13:30]  Tried to...  Okay, ready?  A guy was at the top of the hill.  It was 10 seconds, right?  Tiger...  Because you can take all the time you want to figure out your putt.  Oh, yeah.  You get 15 seconds to hit the ball, and you go, all right, 15 seconds, click.  Now, you got a guy 15 seconds away that gets to run at you as fast as he can, and you have  to concentrate and hit the ball in the little hole as this dude comes... 
[01:14:00]  And once you hit the ball, he can't hit you.  Oh, okay.  But if you're still doing the size up, and he's near you, you can bash him right in  his face.  Then it's a sport.  Bicycling?  Not a sport.  Skiing?  Not a sport.  They said bicycling sport in the office.  Oh, you did make a good point for that.  Certain typing, because they run in teams, so some of them block, and there is a competition  between people, so it's competitive in that way.  If it's defense involved.  There's defense involved, because they do kind of run block for each other. 
[01:14:30]  Ping pong is more of a sport than golf.  Because you have a guy that is trying to keep you from making your shots.  Bowling?  Keep the thing...  Bowling.  If you had midgets holding the pins...  And they can lift them up?  And you can lift them up.  If you had to learn...  How about a midget goalie?  I mean, midgets lifting up the pins, that's just silly.  You got to hook that ball around them.  Just midget goalie in front.  To make it real. 
[01:15:00]  Yes.  You know what?  You're right, Ope.  I'm not even going to exaggerate this.  You can't exaggerate.  We're going to figure out how to make bowling and golf a sport.  It adds some type of realistic defense.  I got an idea.  Well, with golf, what about landmines?  That's dangerous.  Well, that's not realistic.  That's death.  I got an idea with bowling.  Oh, yeah.  You don't want to die when you're doing a hobby.  That's when I make a puzzle.  It's got the bowling.  Go ahead.  It involves a midget.  I'm bowling.  And this is legit.  It could actually work. 
[01:15:30]  Okay.  You have a red zone.  A little square box that the midget must stay in.  In the middle of the lane.  Now, in order to get a strike, you really got to be good and hook it.  The scale level.  You got to do that hook.  You can't just sit there and roll straight on.  Hold on.  But what about...  You can't just roll like...  This is legitimate.  Wait, the midget can't dive to the side?  No, no, no.  No, he's got to stay in the box.  You can always stop, but it teaches you...  But it's not really defense.  No, it is defense.  It is.  You can't pull that. 
[01:16:00]  You can't pull that away.  Well, wait.  Hockey, wait a second.  There has to be some kind of interaction.  You can't...  There are...  Okay, hockey...  Yeah.  Because the puck is so small, though.  But the goalie has a workable space...  Right.  ...to do.  Now, if you can get the ball past the midget...  Past the midget.  In that zone.  In the zone.  No, I say he gets the whole lane.  Back and forth.  Back and forth.  Then let me tell you something.  You're never getting a pin. 
[01:16:30]  Back and forth, not front to back.  Okay, why...  You know what you do then?  Widen the bowling alley to two sizes.  Yeah.  You widen the...  You now double the size.  All right.  And maybe you chain the midget.  Dude, you need the midget zone.  Because there's no way he could...  He sees it coming.  He kicks it into the gutter every time.  But as soon as you figure out that shot...  There's not one guy that could get you around.  As soon as you figure out that shot where it curves over and he can't touch it, then he's not even playing defense anymore. 
[01:17:00]  There's nothing he can do.  You gotta be...  Are you...  Let me tell you something.  That's where the guy becomes an athlete and a competitor in a sport.  You now bowling.  He just passes that one shot.  And then there's no defense.  Sometimes they don't.  Sometimes they gotta hook it and it doesn't quite hook like they want.  As close to the gutter.  Opie, how can you have a skill where your practice doesn't involve competing against someone else to stop you from having your skill? 
[01:17:30]  Where your personal ability is the only thing you're going against.  Your score is the only thing you're going against.  Gymnastics, not a sport.  Because no one is trying to prevent...  Now, football, you have the...  Even basketball, which I think is the...  Maybe other than baseball, maybe hitting a small object at 100,000 pounds.  Does basketball really have defense?  I mean, let's be honest.  But I'm saying, here's the thing about basketball that makes it very difficult.  It's almost as if you were juggling. 
[01:18:00]  And a guy was trying to take your juggle things out of your hand.  So you had to juggle and back up and move while you're juggling.  That's what dribbling a basketball is.  So if you're dribbling a bat, it's reverse juggling.  A guy is trying to stop you from juggling.  Do you understand what I'm saying?  So my thing is, I'm not saying...  That's why I believe Roger Federer is a better athlete or he's more dominant in his thing than Tiger Woods. 
[01:18:30]  I'm not saying Tiger doesn't have a great skill.  Right.  But it's not a sport.  Not a sport.  And I will now look at what they call sports a little differently.  Well, how do you make golf more interesting?  We got the midget in the ball.  You add a 15-second...  Yeah.  I can stop you...  Can you add animals?  Well, no. 
[01:19:00]  Like crazy dogs that might run on the course and just grab your ball and run.  You can add distraction.  Yeah.  You can add...  You can add...  Like, they're showing the Knicks game.  Some dude, some seven-foot monster is trying to keep you from putting a ball in a small hole.  Now, if somebody was trying to prevent Tiger from putting that ball in a small hole, it is now a sport.  Simple as that.  Skiing is not a sport. 
[01:19:30]  Swimming is not a sport.  How is skiing not a sport?  Because it's a skill.  What do you want?  Linebackers on the side of the hill?  Yes.  When you're doing downhill skiing, the guy should be able to bump you like football.  Bump you off your route.  But if you just can just ski down a hill as fast as you can, which I'm not disrespecting what it takes to learn that.  But it's not a sport.  It's a very physical hobby. 
[01:20:00]  I like how he just writes it off as a hobby.  It's a hobby.  It's like building models.  Physical hobby.  Let's go to Don in Jersey.  Don, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  How you guys doing?  Good.  All right.  Just calling in to tell Patrice.  There is a defense in golf.  It's Mother Nature.  Some days she gets mad and she gets Tiger's balls all wet.  And some days she blows his balls all wet.  Let me tell you why that's not true.  They can choose to cut down every tree and build domes. 
[01:20:30]  You can play golf in a giant dome.  If you have to.  Yeah, stop.  And when they have lightning in the area, they shut down the game anyway.  It's not a sport.  How about if they make you play lightning?  Does that make golf a sport?  No, because you can't depend on Mother Nature.  That's just dumb.  Just doing some things out there.  And look at that.  And then that makes football.  If that makes golf a sport, it makes football a quadruple-duple-duple sport.  Because football, not only you deal with someone trying to punch your face off, but you also deal with the snow. 
[01:21:00]  You deal with frostbite.  All right.  Let's say hi to Mike in Cleveland.  Mike, what's up?  You know what else might make it a sport?  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  You know what else might make it a sport?  They all tee off at the same time, and the first person to get the ball in the hole.  So now they're competing against each other.  Only if, only, I'll tell you what.  Hey, he's on to something.  No, no, no.  No.  I'm going to tell you why.  Okay.  I believe in this.  Wait a minute.  And it's not even, it doesn't matter about your total score, it's how many shots per hole, you win that hole, you get a point. 
[01:21:30]  Curling is more of a sport than golf.  Curling.  The thing where the guy takes the broom and sweeps, because he can knock your, he can remove your skill.  Even though at the time you're doing your thing, there's no opponents to stop you.  But there's something to prevent you from having your skill.  All right, you got a hole in your theory here, because Burt in Philly writes, okay, so the following are sports, according to Patrice. 
[01:22:00]  Pictionary, Monopoly, curling, chess, checkers, and foosball.  No, no.  Ready?  Okay, he think I thought of this.  All right.  Ass.  Chess is, ready?  Chess is your skill versus my skill, right?  But your skill doesn't necessarily prevent my skill from happening.  It's your skill is better.  Golf, it's my skill versus your skill.  But if I could take, at one point, if I could make a decision, other than my skill, to take your king off the board and just throw it. 
[01:22:30]  Then it's a sport.  If I could smash your face into your pieces.  Right.  Right?  Yeah.  Then it's a sport.  Arm wrestling.  No one would ever win.  Arm wrestling is a sport.  But no one would.  Because it's your arm versus my arm.  Right.  And I am trying to break those.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  All right, I get that.  But who wins in chess if you have that little move you could do? 
[01:23:00]  No one would ever win.  I think you have to have a winner in a sport.  If I was bigger and faster and I know how to play chess.  See, Tiger might still be a great golfer if, because, okay, say physicality was brought into golf.  Yeah.  Tiger's faster, younger than, say, Fuzzy Zella or whatever.  He punches Fuzzy Zella in the stomach and then golfs.  Right.  So it's not Tiger's fault that he is more of a physical specimen than Fuzzy Zella or somebody. 
[01:23:30]  But the fact is, there's no sport.  And let's add something else.  Defense and age.  There's no sport where a 20-year-old can compete with a 60-year-old.  True.  None.  You don't even have to sell me on this.  And the chess thing, I got that figured out, how to make chess a sport.  Yeah.  Without any physical contact or flicking the various things.  Spiders?  Beforehand.  Spiders.  Spiders walking around the board, then you take the chance to move your piece or not? 
[01:24:00]  You can't have animals or spiders.  I want animals in my sports.  It's got to be competition between people.  Here it is.  The chess boards are totally changed now in professional chess.  Here's how they work.  And each little square, you sit there with a little keyboard that the other guy can't see.  And you can program up to a certain amount of squares that at any time you want, they just go boing and pop a frigging thing up.  Now you sit there and you can do it when there's a pawn on there, if that is what you want to do. 
[01:24:30]  Or wait and see if a better piece gets on there.  And then boing.  Someone else directly affects your strategy.  So then no matter how good your skill is, if all of a sudden you're a queen, you put it on one of those squares and boing, and now your queen's gone.  Dude.  Did I miss the pot party before this show today, by the way?  I'm just saying.  This is all like pot talk.  No, it's not.  This is pot talk.  Because they're arguing Roger Federer. 
[01:25:00]  Roger Federer is more dominant of an athlete in a real sport than Tiger Woods.  Tiger Woods is a great leisurely man.  Hobbyist.  Oh, he's a hobbyist.  But Roger Federer is taking other grown men who have, he's taking a ball and hit it in a hundred and whatever miles an hour at another person.  And that person has to hit it back at him.  And he is better at this than this other guy. 
[01:25:30]  This other guy's stopping Roger Federer's skill from happening.  So Tiger's the king of activities.  The king of leisurely activities.  Leisure activities.  You know what else, between the golf and the football thing?  With golf, Tiger Woods has had some bad, bad outings.  And people that aren't even professionals have done better than Tiger Woods has done.  These are just people that work at the office. 
[01:26:00]  They come in.  They golf.  They decide they've got to be good.  But it's just your average schmo.  You could never put on the gear, go into a professional, go play against a professional football team, and you would end up dead.  You would end up dead.  Because of the nature of it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Any sport that you could possibly challenge a professional at.  A professional.  I don't know how to ski, but I can go, you know what, I'm going to try to ski down a hill faster than you. 
[01:26:30]  And he can't stop me.  So what if something happens, right?  Now, I cannot beat Kevin Garnett in the basketball game.  No matter how much the gods are with me.  If Kevin Garnett would have to be chained to a chair, and he still might beat me.  And he would have to have the flu.  And he would have to be sick.  The flu.  Maybe even rickets.  Shingles.  But I can say, Tiger, I'm going to go at you.  And I'm going to hit this ball.  And by the grace of God, it's possible I can get lucky enough to get a hole-in-one or birdie or whatever the stupid things are called. 
[01:27:00]  Birdie.  And it's possible with luck that I can beat Tiger Woods' score.  Impossible.  But what you're getting at is you actually are competing with him for the entire round or match.  Right.  In football, you're not competing for the whole game because by the first or second play, you are out.  You're done.  I'm calling my mother.  How about this?  How about this?  The uniform you wear for your sport, if you could go out to dinner in that same uniform, it's not a sport. 
[01:27:30]  I'm going to add that one.  To dinner.  I'm moving on from the animals.  Okay.  Yeah, like a tennis player can't go out and just go out to a nice dinner in his little tennis shorts.  So the criteria now, no defense.  What's the other one I said?  There's another one.  You can't wear your clothes.  You can't be able to wear.  You can't wear the same clothes to dinner.  And you can't just play it with somebody. 
[01:28:00]  You can't be a regular person right after.  You have to be able to have to take a shower.  Right.  And take off your jockstrap.  Your sweaty jockstrap.  There was one other reason.  I forgot to.  That there's no chance that you could actually play this game against the professionals.  Right.  All right.  This is the worst of the opening episode on Sirius XM.  Let's see what Cleveland's all about today.  What's up, Mike?  Hey, I got an argument for Patrice on that one.  It's only a sport if it can kill you. 
[01:28:30]  Hmm.  That's not a...  That's...  I mean, that's an argument that's kind of for what I'm saying.  The possibility of dying during golf, again, is maybe a golf cart hits you.  Yeah.  It runs over your foot and your foot gets infected.  But...  You get nailed by a golf ball in the temple.  Yeah, but that's just...  You ever get hit by a golf ball?  It's like being shot.  I've never touched a golf ball.  I don't...  Why would I?  I'm not a hobbyist.  How about the lightning strikes?  That...  That doesn't count.  It's just not a sport. 
[01:29:00]  It's just not a sport.  It's a...  It's a competition.  Mm-hmm.  Your...  Your...  Your number against my number, but...  It's not a...  It's not a sport.  It's just not a sport.  All right.  Let's go to Greg.  Greg, what's up?  Hey.  Morning, guys.  Good morning, Greg.  When I was in college, I developed full-contact golf.  It was probably the most fun we had when we weren't drinking on the golf course.  Well, how do you play?  All right.  It's teams of four.  Each team has a designated hitter. 
[01:29:30]  That guy is the one who hits the ball.  We kind of do what Anthony mentioned, where everybody starts off...  You know, you start off with two or three different teams.  Everyone starts at the exact same time.  Now, the other three guys on your team that are not your hitters are your blockers.  They may not pick up the ball, but everything else is game.  So, you can block the other teammates into their putter, into other putters.  You can block them and hold them over the hole while the other guy's trying to putt the 
[01:30:00]  ball into the hole.  What about when you're on...  Yeah, but what about when you're on the fairway?  When you're on the fairway, you're pretty much just beating the crap out of your friends.  Are you getting in the way of the swinging of a golf club?  Jesus.  You don't want to get in the way of the swinging of a golf club, but you yourself cannot hit  the opposing team's putter, but you can push their own people into the putter.  So, while you're on the fairway, you're over there pushing a couple of guys, waiting for  the guy just before he's about to swing.  You start body-checking his friends into the swing. 
[01:30:30]  So, you can check his friends into the swing.  That's a sport.  That is a sport.  And if Tiger was the best at that, I'd go Tiger Woods is better than Roger Federer if  he continuously won at what this guy is saying.  Better at a sport.  If you don't get any 100-yard hits, you don't get someone who hits 200, 300 yards except off  the tee.  After that, you're hitting it like maybe 10, 20 yards.  You don't want to pull the swing.  You're not trying to nail your friends with a golf club. 
[01:31:00]  You know?  And that is fun.  You guys are nuts.  That's fun.  All right.  Thanks, sir.  Let's go to Jimmy in Massachusetts.  Jimmy, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  All right, Jimmy.  Let's go back to the chess situation where you say you need defense in the sport, right?  Yes, sir.  And you say, oh, well, if I reach across the table, grab your face and smash it into the  chess board.  Okay.  That's a defensive play.  Say you put my king in check, though.  Mm-hmm.  I now have to make a defensive play and block that check. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah, I think you're talking chess might have to be a sport there, Patrice.  You know what?  And I'm not married.  There is a defense.  I was playing chess this weekend, matter of fact.  I was doing a lot of defensive moves.  I'm not married to making things not a sport if you can sell.  Now, if you're considering that chess has an official defense, like your skill is affected  by somebody else, like you can't have your skill if somebody's not trying to stop you.  That's all I'm saying.  So if you agree that chess will stop, that that other person's skill can stop yours, then 
[01:32:00]  it's a sport.  Why don't we add another rule?  Like if you have a high IQ playing this sport, it's not a sport.  All right, take downhill skiing, you know, racing or whatever.  My offense is, I'm going to get in front of you.  My defense is, I'm going to stay in front of you.  I'm not going to let you pass me.  Wrong.  That's not defense.  That's defense.  That's not defense.  I gave you, I'll give you chess, skiing, that's, that's, that's part of the skill. 
[01:32:30]  And, but you are, you can't really affect how fast I'm going.  I'm going downhill with you.  You can't touch me.  You can't do anything.  It's, it's the fact that I'm faster on skis than you, which is not a sport.  That's my skill is better than your skill.  I have mastered my hobby.  All right.  I'm not buying the chess one either.  All right.  I don't think I want to say chess either.  You know why?  It's, it's, it's defense, but once removed, it's not defense against you directly. 
[01:33:00]  It's defense once removed to the pieces of the game.  You're adjusting to that guy's move with his skill.  You're adjusting, but you're not affecting what he's doing.  Let's go to Matt in Queens.  Matt, what's up?  So chess might be a sport now.  No, I'm saying no.  I take it back.  Sorry, dude.  You always had me.  Let's go to Matt in Queens.  Matt.  Good morning.  Good morning.  It's your golf.  You got that window block in the ball.  Yeah, there you go. 
[01:33:30]  It's your golf is now a sport, Patrice.  You know what?  Mechanical defenses, though.  If you have, if you have obstacles.  They gotta be, they can't be man-made.  They gotta be human.  It's not.  Thank you, Opie.  It's gotta be something that's living and breathing.  The hurdles, the 20-meter hurdles, not a sport.  That's in your way?  In your way, no.  Detours, no.  That doesn't make it a sport.  Doesn't matter.  Track and field, no.  All right.  NASCAR, not a sport.  What? 
[01:34:00]  Now you're gonna get people crazy.  Now you're gonna get people crazy out there.  It is absolutely illegal in race car driving to affect by actually, these guys getting  to fight.  I see it on ESPN.  Dude, you clipped me.  It's illegal to do these things, man.  You're allowed to do a little bumping.  No, you're not.  They bump.  It's accepted.  You're gonna get beat up for it.  Smoking weed in Holland or drinking liquor in a bag here.  It's accepted, but it's not legal to touch a man's car while he's driving 200 miles an hour. 
[01:34:30]  That car is absolutely a sport.  Absolutely not.  You got team members on the track helping you out, blocking other drivers.  I don't see it as a sport, though, because it's a car.  No, it's like bicycling.  It's a car.  It's my foot is heavier than your foot, and I'm driving around.  It's a skill.  It's transportation.  Listen, everybody.  You just dumbed down NASCAR to a heavy foot.  It's a skill.  Are you insane?  It's a hobby.  You don't have any rednecks let's just toss.  Listen, I'm saying it's a skill. 
[01:35:00]  They should be happy with that.  Very skill.  I'm not saying you're a bum if you drive a car 200 miles an hour, but I'm saying it's not a sport.  You can't.  Now, look.  If crashing your car against the side of the wall was part of the rules, then it's a sport.  All right.  If I can stop you.  I could drive a couple of hundred miles an hour.  I could do it.  I could do it today.  Right now.  It has nothing to do with it.  You were dying in a fiery car crash.  They're all broken down sons of bitches in a car that could do just as well as a guy that is good at the sport. 
[01:35:30]  And I'll tell you.  Oh, here it is.  It doesn't fit the criteria.  I remember it was an age thing.  Yeah.  It's not a sport if at 45 you can decide to take it up.  Right.  I was reading about this old NASCAR driver over the weekend.  He's going to be, what, 70, 72?  Oh, Jesus.  Say stop.  Not allowed.  Stop.  Not allowed.  Look it up.  It was in the paper on Sunday.  Skill, finesse, all that is there. 
[01:36:00]  But sport, I never thought a NASCAR would be in a sport.  How about Dave in Philly?  Dave, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Good morning.  Listen to us on WYSP.  What's up, Dave?  Patrice, you couldn't be more wrong, especially about swimming.  Swimming requires mental toughness, unbelievable physical endurance.  Yes.  My son is a state champion swimmer in the state of Pennsylvania.  Great for him.  I dare you to get in the pool with him.  I will never beat your son, but that little sissy is not doing a sport. 
[01:36:30]  He is swimming against his own self, meaning that no one, wait, sir, no one, wait a minute,  no one can take your son's head and dunk it as he's doing his little breaststroke.  I like the opianimal idea for this one.  Thank you.  It's the obvious.  How about you throw sharks in the pool?  Is it now a sport?  It has to be something.  You're swimming faster and you're trying to avoid the sharks?  Wait a minute.  Now, water polo is a sport.  That's a sport.  If your son played water polo, sir, he's an athlete. 
[01:37:00]  Wait, hold on.  He is an athlete anyway, but he's not competing in a sport.  The only sports that you're picking on are sports that black guys suck at.  It's not my fault.  Maybe that's why they invented those sports, so you can have something to do.  Okay, yeah.  Because your son is a swimmer.  You're angry because he can't compete with those big, giant N-words that will smash his dumb little butterfly.  I'm going to tell you, something is not a sport if you have the term butterfly in it. 
[01:37:30]  I think he's right, Patrice.  You people can't swim.  We can't swim, but that's not true.  We play hockey now, and you let us in there.  Our ankles are stronger.  That's true, I know.  And he's only a state champion for Pennsylvania.  How does he do against Florida?  Come on, man.  Dude, your son is physically gifted, maybe, and he's probably good at it.  He's probably skillful at it, but he's not in a sport. 
[01:38:00]  How fast he swims, no one can affect how fast he swims.  So he's not in a sport.  All right.  Absolutely wrong.  How would they affect it?  Because when he is in a competition and he's swimming, the guy in the lane next to him,  even though there is a lane line in between them, can go over to that lane line and cause  turbulence, meaning people are going into his lane.  Ah, shut up.  That's just people cause turbulence when they swim. 
[01:38:30]  It's something you've got to get over, but it's not.  Wow.  Now pilots are athletes.  I don't see it used much.  Yeah.  All right, Dave.  Thank you.  Man, you're firing up some people today.  Because they didn't wait.  And the shark, by the way, is too obvious.  I say big octopus.  Ah!  Oh, that'd be scary.  Ah!  You're just ready to touch the winning, like, the edge of the pool.  And an octopus grabs your foot.  He grabs your foot and pulls you backwards a little bit.  Did he win his argument?  No.  Is swimming still not a sport?  It's not a sport.  Thank you.  How about this?  Well, following the Patrice rules, no, it's not. 
[01:39:00]  I could turn anything into a sport that isn't a sport.  All right.  Here it is.  Swimming.  You go to the one end.  You do that cool little flip move.  And then you've got to swim back, right?  Yes.  Whoever hits that first thing, there's a button there.  You hit it.  Every other lane now has a current going in the opposite direction, based on the fact  that you got to the other side first.  Nope.  That's just like hurdles.  But you are the one that did it.  It has to be another person.  Yeah.  I hit.  I got to the end first.  What if you have your opponent works a wave machine? 
[01:39:30]  As you're trying to do it.  Okay.  Wait a minute.  Okay.  Wait a minute.  Let's figure this out.  So he has a wave machine.  Wave machine.  And it's important how fast he's going to be physically exerting to him.  Right.  So.  Oh, now it's completely a sport.  So, but, but, the only person that works the wave machine is the other swimmer.  Right.  So you're trying to.  If he wears himself out, he's going to suck at swimming.  So he's got a balance.  It's a fine balance.  Now that's a sport. 
[01:40:00]  I'll go with that.  That's a sport.  That's a sport now.  All right.  All right.  People are like, people are just waking up, tuning in, going, these guys smoke  pop up for their show today.  This is a legitimate argument.  Hot talk.  And you know where this comes from?  It comes from people, again, if you didn't listen, Roger Federer, who's more dominant  in their sport?  Right.  Roger Federer or Tiger Woods?  Tiger Woods is dominant in his hobby.  Roger Federer is dominant in a sport. 
[01:40:30]  Here's another one.  If you have a lint brush in your equipment, equipment bags, can't talk today.  It's not a sport.  If you can wear a sweater vest, if you can wear a wife-beater sweater.  If you can wear your same clothes to a christening.  If you don't have to take a shower afterwards.  Swimming, you're already clean.  He'll call back and go, dude, you dumb negro.  It's chlorine.  You know, the eyes can burn. 
[01:41:00]  You can swim in a freshwater lake.  The guy never got, yeah, we can all do it.  If after you complete your sport, you can jump in your car and go to a wedding without  changing.  That's not a sport.  How disappointed was that guy once he found out his son is not an athlete?  We can all, like, obviously, we wouldn't beat his son.  Of course not.  But I could do it.  I could jump in the pool.  I could swim to one end.  I could swim to the other.  Let's go to Sonny.  Sonny.  Hey, guys.  How the hell can Patrice turn around and say that skiing is not a sport? 
[01:41:30]  Is it because it's dominantly?  I mean, I'm starting to agree from that guy from Cleveland that, you know, black people  don't participate in all these sports.  Ope.  Ope.  Ready?  Hold up, sir.  I hear your point.  Here's the Kramer situation.  I made them mad enough to start going racial.  I made great points.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  And if you can name, if you can name a sport that black people don't, that, wait a minute. 
[01:42:00]  Ready?  I'll turn this to, I'll destroy the racial thing.  All right.  All right, listen.  The 100-meter dash is not a sport.  Black people.  Black people.  Right.  All right.  With the agony of defeat guy rolling down that mountain on a ski.  Yeah.  He got defeated in his hobby.  He slipped.  If he got tripped and it was part of the.  Yes.  Thank you, sir.  Do you see where I'm going now?  If you could trip skiers.  Those old.  And it's a sport. 
[01:42:30]  Sir, those old fast-running Negroes, I don't think Jesse Owens was doing a sport.  Right.  Jesse Owens wasn't javelin throwing.  It's not a sport.  Yeah, he's beating up his own people there, Sonny.  Yeah.  So that's what I'm saying.  It's not a racial thing.  He's saying track and field.  Well, all track and field, just about right.  I'm trying to think real fast.  Track and field in general is not a sport.  It's athletic.  It's an amazing skill.  You're fast and running, but it's not a sport.  You cannot put skiing in there.  Yes, I can.  Skiing is absolutely in there. 
[01:43:00]  Yes.  Tons of people get killed.  Where's the defense?  Tons of people get killed by the obstacles.  And the obstacles are dangerous.  I didn't say it wasn't dangerous.  It is not a sport because me going down a hill is not affected by another person pushing me, hitting me, or touching me so I can do it freely.  And if I suck too bad and I can't miss a tree, that doesn't make me a athlete.  All right, listen, listen, Patrice. 
[01:43:30]  Hold on.  Just get everyone on the same page because people are just tuning in for the first time.  Basically, Patrice said you need some type of defense to make it a sport.  That's what we're getting at.  So with skiing, let's say.  Where's the defense?  Let's say defense is a guy with a blowtorch just messing up the course a little bit.  Would that be good enough?  Doing something.  Where next thing you know, you're flying down a mountain and you hit like a patch of grass or dirt.  Ready?  That would affect your performance.  We're both going down.  Okay.  And I know.  Okay?  You know what makes skiing a sport? 
[01:44:00]  Any James Bond movie where they're skating down and this dude, he's next to you and he's poking you with those sticks.  Right.  He's kicking you in your face.  Now that's hard.  And you fall and you win.  Because, put it this way, if you're better than me and I can beat you by stopping you from being better than me, by doing something that counteracts your ability.  People are mistaking difficulty, skill. 
[01:44:30]  They're mistaking that for what you're saying.  Why is that not acceptable?  It's skillful.  Right.  It's just not a sport.  They're putting down the fact that it's not a skillful thing that takes years of training to get good at.  And not everybody can be very good at it.  But it's another thing that people do for recreation.  I'm not diminishing the skill.  They strap skis on, go to the mountains, and a lot of people are very good.  And they ski, and then they go to the lodge, have a few hot toddies.  You never see people, like I said, putting on the helmet, the shoulder pads, getting out there, professional football team, and getting slaughtered. 
[01:45:00]  Even flag football, nobody's getting touched.  But for me to be able to run and keep you from grabbing my towel outside of my pants.  It's competing with a person.  It's a sport.  You're competing with a person.  And if it's accepted that you can drink while you do it, it's not a sport.  That's bowling to you.  It absolutely not.  Faint up very much.  But with golf, because this started with Tiger Woods, what about blindside tackling?  What about you're officially against Tiger Woods, and your whole job as he's playing is to kind of blend in with the crowd and then make your move and do your blindside tackle? 
[01:45:30]  Strategically, Opie, you just made golf a sport.  Strategically.  Now, what that adds is an awful kind of pressure.  Right.  So Tiger's looking over his shoulder.  Looking around, wonder where the blindside tackle's coming from.  Maybe you get five, you call it surprises during golf, where five times your opponent is just strategically. 
[01:46:00]  That's what I mean.  Some guy just standing in the gallery.  That's supposed to be one of those claps after the shot guys.  And at any hole, this guy could be there and just run out and tackle you.  And like football, they have the Motorola things, and the guy upstairs, and he goes, just like a football, like, what's the thing?  When you make a challenge, somebody's upstairs going, okay.  Okay, all right, he's good.  Now, sit him now.  Bow!  Each golfer has five of these guys somewhere on the course.  He would be petrified every hole. 
[01:46:30]  You'd be losing your mind.  How could you tee off?  How could you just?  How?  And you can't, there's no home field advantage in golf because no one can talk.  No one can go Tiger.  No fans of Payne Stewart.  I think Payne Stewart died, but I don't know.  You know what, hold on, really fast.  No fans of him can affect.  Patrice.  You can't even say Tiger sucks.  Yeah, let me throw that in there.  It's not a sport if you're a viewer or whatever and you're not allowed to cheer and yell and scream. 
[01:47:00]  To cheer or root for your favorite guy.  During the game.  Absolutely.  During gameplay.  You can't have concentration during a sport.  Yeah.  Huh?  Yeah, tennis.  No, no, no, no.  Wait a minute, though.  Wait a minute.  The point, Dan.  We're talking aspects, Dan.  Tennis is a sport because I'm trying to stop you.  That is a sport.  So we can do that with no audience.  Right.  You can play football with no audience.  But I'm saying that football, dude, you're dealing also with people yelling. 
[01:47:30]  You're dealing with this guy calling you, you stupid.  And Negroes don't play.  Now, I got to deal with that as I'm trying to smash somebody in their face or they're trying to hit me in my face.  Yeah.  That's a sport.  But golf, shh.  All right.  Kill that squirrel.  Hold on.  We got a couple more calls and we're going to move on here.  Joe in Jersey.  What's up?  Yeah.  Hey.  Yeah.  I agree with Patrice to an extent.  And the whole thing is a sport is something where you compete against another team. 
[01:48:00]  Teams have a lot to do with it.  You know, if I can't score more than you, it's not a sport.  Thank you.  Well, no.  Well, because golf, you can score more than me.  You can just score.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But, you know what?  I should be able to shoot ahead of you then.  And if you get up to my hole and you can pass me, then you can tackle me and stop me from making a putt.  There's plenty of ways to make it a sport.  Let's go to Chris in Pittsburgh.  Chris, he knows how to make skiing a sport.  Go ahead, Chris.  Patrice, I think the only way you'd be able to make skiing a sport, 
[01:48:30]  or let's say that Anthony is the skier.  You stand on the hillside with a hose and spray him as he tries to get out of the hill.  Yes.  All right.  That's good.  And I have to be the skier.  Right.  I have to also, I have to then ski.  Yeah, you can't have a designated hose guy.  And it has to be strategic.  It has to be a strategic time where I can use the hose.  Can we sell this to ESPN?  We're coming up with a great, great show, man.  Are you kidding me?  Let me tell you something.  Can you imagine if we.  Should I even open my mouth about this today? 
[01:49:00]  Because this is a show.  This is so a show.  This is a show.  And I was saying.  You get people to.  Hold on.  Real sports.  Hold on.  You get people to sign away their lives and you play golf our way.  The Opie and Anthony and Patrice way.  Where you got five guys on your team somewhere ready to blindside you.  Blindside tackles.  Oh, I'm telling.  I was sitting there going.  Should I.  Because who wouldn't watch.  It's like.  Okay.  Who wouldn't watch a downhill skier and you don't know where that. 
[01:49:30]  We make them a sport.  We make them a sport.  The fire hose is coming from.  The fire hose guy is.  The fire hose guy.  God.  I'm so pissed.  I'm so pissed.  Just knocks him off his feet.  Who wouldn't watch that?  Who wouldn't watch that?  Who wouldn't watch golf every Sunday if you knew at any given time there was going to  be a blindside tackle.  Someone's going to come running out and just blindside him.  Kind of like the new Tiger Woods commercial where he tackles the dude.  There you go.  Imagine if you get to see that during the actual sport.  Or the competition.  And did you see that they made a big deal out of that. 
[01:50:00]  That Tiger tackled the dude.  Yeah.  Because Tiger innately knows he's not doing a sport.  But he's athletic.  So when he did that, they were like, hey man, Tiger.  He was showing that he is an athlete.  Yeah, dude.  You got to be careful.  They got stuntmen for that.  And Tiger's like, I can do that.  Right.  Did you see how upset, and I think it was the first jackass or one of them, that the  golfers got when they blew off those air horns in the bushes.  They'd hide in the bushes, wait for these guys to tee off and blow the air horn.  Hey, hey, now. 
[01:50:30]  Yep.  Yep.  Should be able to do that.  Opie.  All right.  We start with golf.  We'll end with golf.  Here's Ken.  Ken, what's up?  Hey, fellas.  Hey, man.  What's up?  I think Patrice is absolutely right.  It is an acquired skill.  It is not a sport.  Anything like bocce, darts, bowling that you can play while drinking a scotch and having  a cigar is definitely not a sport.  It's an acquired skill.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  Yep.  Anything you can play at a nudist camp is not a sport. 
[01:51:00]  Billiards could possibly, under my rules, could possibly maybe be a sport.  That's kind of like chess.  Oh, we've all played.  But it's kind of like a chess one.  You're through a second generation of defense.  You're not physically your body defending, but you're putting balls in position.  It's not a sport if it's just obstacles.  Right.  But we've all played extreme pool.  Who hasn't played extreme pool where you're allowed to shoot at the guy who's trying to  shoot?  Oh. 
[01:51:30]  You get a little drunk and it becomes a whole new thing.  The balls are launching off the table.  Oh, yeah.  Smacking into each other full speed.  What?  That idea.  I love your idea.  Oh, yeah.  No, get.  Just kidding.  He's doing nothing.  Get him in there right now and pitch it.  And pitch it.  Get him to pitch it.  All right.  Why don't we move on?  We got the 72.  He's 72.  NASCAR run at 72.  Good old James Hilton, right?  No one would have swollen prostate should be able to do anything.  Run the 72. 
[01:52:00]  I believe he was.  The Ford Model T gets it out there.  He drank it first.  He was just passing him at 200 miles an hour.  He's doing like 38.  He probably has a scarf and big goggles.  Those big goggles.  Yeah.  Driving gloves and a hat.  Can I go with the hack line?  He's going to have his blinker on the whole time.  Because he's old.  He's going to have his left hand blinker on the whole time. 
[01:52:30]  Loser.  No blinkers in NASCAR.  So it's impossible.  It's got to be based on reality.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Good old James Hilton making a NASCAR run at 72.  At an age when some 72-year-olds are having their licenses repossessed.  James Hilton is cranking it up on a racetrack at the Daytona 500 at 185 miles per hour plus.  Yeah.  They've been joking about it. 
[01:53:00]  Joking about it.  Hilton said the other day from his shop in Inman, South Carolina.  They said Jeff Gordon came into the garage area too hard and ran over my walker.  Ah, ha, ha, ha.  You're driving around in a little rascal.  One of those little souped up little rascals.  Whatever.  He's going to.  His car, it should come with a Tommy gun and someone trying to kill him.  On the running boards.  Mah.  Mah, mugsy.  Mah.  That would make NASCAR a sport if you could have that going on.  Defense.  You got your guys. 
[01:53:30]  You got your guys shooting out tires as you know.  Take the tires out.  Or, yeah, the other people from the other pit crew,  when they come into the pits,  they can throw down those police spike strips  when they're ready to leave the pit.  Brand new tires.  All right, we got Winnie.  We got him.  Well, Winnie, what's up?  Make it fast, will you?  Okay, I just want to know.  Is mugging a sport?  Mugging.  Why?  Mugging somebody.  Yeah, let's see.  It's a guy, and he's in direct competition with somebody else, 
[01:54:00]  and there's a valuable prize at the end.  Hell, then.  I've seen all these crazy things here, and it's just on them.  Well, Winnie, if you're going to go that far,  you might as well go all the way, then rape's a sport.  Rape would be a sport.  Let's be honest here.  It truly is.  It came out of your mouth,  but we got to take it to the limit on this show.  There's two people involved.  One is trying to protect something from another competitor,  another athlete.  And one is certainly trying to score.  Right.  You know, when you put one between the uprights. 
[01:54:30]  She was not ready to go the distance with that one.  I understand.  She had her little funny mugging quirk,  which probably had a tinge of racialness to it.  And then it's like, hey, rape's a sport.  All right, you went too far.  All right.  All right, goodbye.  Goodbye.  Hey, Louis, you bring it to Anthony at the Borgata?  I did.  I was at the Borgata plane.  I want to hear your side of this because Anthony said his side.  You scared me.  At first, Louis scared me at first because he was standing too close to me, 
[01:55:00]  guy.  Yeah.  But I was sitting and he was standing,  so I had no idea it was Louis.  I had found out he was going to be there,  but I was getting there too late to actually see the show.  No, yeah.  Here's what happened.  I did a show at the music box at the Borgata,  and then I, you know, gambled stupidly for several hours.  What's your poison?  I like blackjack, but I also like poker.  I played some poker and stuff. 
[01:55:30]  It's just stupid.  I can't be bothered with poker.  It takes way too long to possibly win a couple hundred dollars.  Yeah.  And some people are annoying.  I know you do.  I got in a little shitty battle with a guy,  like a verbal shitty thing with a dude at the poker table.  Why?  Because I bluffed weird, but I had a shitty hand,  and I raised, and then he saw I had to show my stupid cards  because I got called.  So I turned over my suit.  Like a 2-7 off suit.  Yeah, that's what I basically had.  And he said, you were checking and raising with nothing. 
[01:56:00]  And I go, yeah.  I just decided to do that.  Yeah, that is part of poker.  Part of the game.  It really is.  Well, if you want to throw your money away,  and I go, yeah, it's my money.  And I do want to throw it away.  Yeah, you fucking idiot.  And if you didn't have a hand you were confident with,  you might have folded with one of my raises,  and I'd have been laughing at you, douchebag.  Yeah, and I make more money than you do anyway.  Right.  Fucking I would shoot myself if I woke up as you.  Or anyone at the Borgata except for Anthony and me.  At that point. 
[01:56:30]  The whole building full of fucking should-be suicides.  Drunks and the whores that are bringing them drinks.  Yes, that's it.  Yes, they really are a bunch of fucking dollar-siphoning pigs,  those women, aren't they here?  Drink this, stupid.  I got to say, the Borgata, though, has the hottest waitresses.  Oh, yeah.  The Borgata babes.  Because you go to the...  I went to the Tropicana once.  They have definitely the most genetically lucky cunts in all of the city.  Oh, absolutely. 
[01:57:00]  Fucking literally.  I went to the Tropicana once, and it was like fucking Flo from Alice.  Yes.  The Kiss My Grits woman was bringing me fucking drinks.  She's been there since the casino opened.  Oh, yeah.  Chewing gum.  How you doing, sweetie?  Get out of here, beehive head.  When do you ship out?  When do you ship out?  Oh, just horrible.  But so I'm gambling, and then I just, you know, you actually make decisions to be stupid, 
[01:57:30]  because I went up and down, and I still had $1,000 in cash on me.  I was probably about even for the night, and then I decided, oh, I'm exhausted.  You know what?  I'm just going to put $500 on a blackjack table and go to bed.  Like, I wanted to lose quickly so I could go to bed sooner.  You nailed it, man.  We explained that on a past show in Vegas.  Like, I had just a couple hundred dollars.  I'm like, I want to win this fast, because, I mean, I'll lose this fast, because I want  to go to bed.  I want to go to sleep.  Why couldn't you just take the chips and leave, and then maybe play them tomorrow?  Exactly.  The same mentality went through.  And then I won a couple hands, and I was getting mad. 
[01:58:00]  I'm like, no, I just want to lose this so I can go to bed.  Exactly.  But anyway, sorry.  I could have taken that $500 and gone to the gift shop and bought something for $500.  Right, right, right.  Buy something stupid, and it's worth more than getting.  Yeah, a music box, and then, like, broken it and thrown it out the window.  That would have been more.  Your head gets fucked up when you're in the casinos, because with this $200, I won a couple  hands, and now it's going up.  And I'm like, now it's going to take longer to lose this.  And I just want to go to bed.  $500, you could have bought four suits.  Exactly.  I wonder how many people actually do exactly what you're mentioning. 
[01:58:30]  You mean just to?  Yeah, just to blow the money so they can finally crash.  Yeah, I think it happens a lot.  You start playing stupid.  So I'm walking around looking for a table to put $500 on, and I get to the $100 tables,  and then I see Anthony.  And I see him, like, three-quarter view from behind, and I go, oh, that's Anthony.  And he's just staring at his chips and cards.  And I debated not going up to him.  Because you don't want to be the cooler.  Well, no, because when you see somebody in their bad element, like, I knew, I saw this 
[01:59:00]  story on his face that he told me, didn't need to tell me, but he was in Manhattan.  He had no reason to be there.  He's in Manhattan.  Yeah.  And he just went, fuck it.  I'm going to go down to Atlantic City and just make myself feel bad.  And it's kind of like, for me, when I would go to Times Square back before there was the  internet, and you had to go out and get porn, you had to go make a fucking errand of getting  disgusting porn.  I'm running an errand.  Yeah.  So I'd go to Times Square where the most disgusting porn is, and I'd get all kinds of awful things  that I'm ashamed of. 
[01:59:30]  And then I'm walking with them under my arm, and I run into somebody, and I'm like, hey,  yeah, don't even look at my face right now.  I'm a werewolf.  Please don't talk to me.  So that's what I felt like.  I'm seeing him in a bad state.  And I stood behind him just waiting for him to notice me.  And then he looked up, and he went like, oh, hey.  Hey, no, I heard you were here, but I didn't.  Please just let me lose my money.  I was just losing it.  And then Louie decides, well, I'm going to sit down, and we're going to gamble. 
[02:00:00]  And I lost my 501 shitty hand.  Yeah.  It was just so bad.  You did 501.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  Then I dug.  See, that's a lot of fun.  And I lost another 500 sitting.  What I love about blackjack is getting, let's say, us together and playing.  And then it's not even really about winning or losing.  You're just having fun busting each other's balls.  It is fun when you have a good table.  Yeah.  When you have a good table, fun people.  But if you're just sitting there rifling through your chips.  Looking at the dealer with nothing but contempt. 
[02:00:30]  And the second I go, like, I'll bet 100, 100, 100.  Win, lose, win, lose.  And then when I make that big fucking bet, insurance, insurance, because the dealer pulled  a fucking ace.  Yeah.  And no matter what the dealer's showing, like, I could have a 17.  And, you know, it's in God's hands at that point.  I can't hit it.  You're done.  You get a 17.  The dealer's showing a 9.  And you're sitting there going, maybe the dealer has, like, a 7 under there and is going  to pull this. 
[02:01:00]  He's saying, no, what does the dealer always have in the hole?  Oh, it's a face card or a 10.  Oh, wow.  Every time.  And he acts surprised.  Oh, wow.  What's insurance?  What's insurance?  You get to put some money up on the insurance little place on the table.  And if the dealer does have blackjack, you win that bet.  That's it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  About, like, half of your initial bet.  When did they start that?  It's been for years.  I've never been at a table for that.  Anthony was losing so bad, he had such shitty luck, that at one point, the dealer was showing 
[02:01:30]  a 3, which means you probably got a good chance.  Oh, yeah.  And I made a joke that I bet she's got an 18 card under there.  Like, that's going to, like, somehow magically.  So then she turns over.  She has an 8.  And the next one's a 10.  A 10.  She goes, 21.  21.  Louis is like, I'm sorry.  I go, no.  You called for the 18 card.  Yeah, and plus there's some Indonesian guy who's really betting a lot of money next to  us.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And he's looking at me, you know.  Not very happy with the 18 card comment.  No. 
[02:02:00]  But they will do that so much more often than you will.  Like, I don't know how many times the cards are flipping.  Boom.  There's a queen.  I got a queen.  I'm like, all right.  They go around the rest of the table.  And a three.  A four.  Yeah.  And you're just sitting there.  And then when the dealer's got a picture card showing, it's like, where's their four?  Never.  And three, like, not all the time, but most of the time.  They turn that fucking card over and they got a 20 so many times. 
[02:02:30]  You know how hard it is?  Like, when I got a queen showing, I fucking pray for a five and I never get one.  Sometimes I'll get, like, another face card, which is boring, and I'll fucking just quit  the hand right there.  Just leave.  Yeah, you got to fold.  You fold.  Fold blame.  I would love to go into a casino with, like, money on a hidden camera and fold every time  I have two face cards.  I fold.  This is a bunch of bullshit. 
[02:03:00]  Double down on your 12 and 13.  Like a seven and a nine.  You fucking just bet it all.  Against they have an A show.  I'm all in.  I'm all in.  Just all in.  Let's say hi to James in Georgia.  James, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  Love your show.  Thank you.  Hey, my mom was a blackjack dealer on a riverboat in Mississippi River.  Oh, yes.  And that insurance, man, that's a sucker bet.  You never want to bet that.  Yeah, no, I don't bet the insurance, but...  You know what they do, though? 
[02:03:30]  If you have 21, though, and they are showing an ace and you can do even money.  Even money.  You got to do that.  Every time.  You're an asshole if you don't do that.  I always take the even money.  What's that mean?  If you have 21 and they're showing an ace, that means if they have 21, you get nothing.  And you push.  But you can say, I want even money, and then you won't get two to one.  Oh, God, this is boring.  Then you won't get...  We're just explaining blackjack.  Like, this is one of those shows where...  You get better odds of the blackjack.  Let's go to Adam in Alabama.  Adam?  Hey, what's up, guys? 
[02:04:00]  Hey.  I love the show.  Just wanted to say, hey.  Yeah, y'all just commented on what I was going to say.  On the insurance, you know, you don't win the money.  Insurance?  Oh, yeah.  You just get to keep your bet.  You lose what you put up for insurance.  The dealer will take that away like a bitch.  Oh, but you keep your bet.  So you might lose 100 or whatever, but you keep your bet.  Yeah.  Right, right.  Whatever you put, whatever...  Half your bet is the insurance, and then when you lose that, if he does that blackjack,  if he doesn't, well, you keep your bet up, but you lose your insurance money.  All right, so it's basically just an additional gamble. 
[02:04:30]  Yes.  Yeah, that's all.  I mean, because you already risked the money, so it's stupid.  You're throwing good money after bad, basically.  If I had a G up there, I would do it, but I wouldn't do it, you know, if you're betting  $1,500, you know, I wouldn't...  It's also the hand.  If you want to protect a good hand, then you would do it.  Like, if you've got a crappy hand, that's probably not going to win anyway.  Right.  Right.  All right, thank you, sir.  Let's go to John in Freeport before we move on here.  John, what's up?  Oh, man, I just got to say, I got plenty of friends that are dealers, man, and when they  kick ass at the tables and put people out all night, hell, they go to another boat and 
[02:05:00]  play.  They're hot on their luck.  Oh, you mean they...  Because they feel like they're lucky.  They're lucky.  Even though they're not winning actual money.  A lot of dealers I've talked to don't play the games.  Yeah.  They don't gamble.  Yeah, they know how that's ridiculous.  Exactly.  They see people losing their money, so they just...  They just go, I'm not playing that.  Screw that.  How stupid are these people that I'm dealing to?  Jesus.  I get taught every four seconds how dumb this is.  I need Keith, the cop, to go with me, though, to the casinos, because I realize he's the 
[02:05:30]  guy that keeps me in check.  I'm a child when I'm alone like that, because I brought about $5,000 up to just a little over  $30,000.  And left the Borgata with $1 in my pocket that I had to give to the guy for bringing my car  up.  So I left with no money.  I had a car that I just threw away. 
[02:06:00]  I could have had a car.  It was a car.  Do people get mad if a dealer was beating you?  And every time the dealer beats you, he goes, yes!  I think so, yeah.  I would kill...  You could have probably gotten two Ford Focuses.  Yes.  $30,000.  Two.  And just strapped in and played bumper cars with him with a friend.  That's it.  You could have done that.  Brand new cars.  You could have done that.  And just played bumper cars and giggle our asses off.  Yes.  But instead, I gave it all back. 
[02:06:30]  How about this?  You could have bought your fucking pal, who maybe doesn't make as much, a fine gift.  That's right.  I could have done that, too.  Or given it to a...  You could have bought in a Ford Focus, gone up to a fat girl that you see all the time  that's lonely in your neighborhood.  Here.  And say, here's the car.  Here.  This is for you, you fat cunt.  Sort of a backhanded gift.  Yeah.  Like, she's got to take the car, but...  Yeah.  And then have, like, have I'm a fat cunt written on it so that she has to.  She's like, I got to take it. 
[02:07:00]  It's a good car.  What would it take for you to walk away?  To walk away?  That's why I'm saying I need Keith the cop there with me.  Because it wasn't even like it was early in the evening.  Early in the evening is very difficult to walk away.  Because it's all night.  This was well into the night.  I think the morning already.  It was stupid of me.  So Keith always goes like, you want to leave?  Because especially if I start losing, I go, all right.  And then I'll say something like, all right, a couple more hands.  Let's see how those go.  And then I'm out of here.  So I probably would have lost a little more and then gone, all right, let's go. 
[02:07:30]  Dude, if I'm up 1,000.  But if I'm alone, I'm like a child.  I just don't have the bug to gamble.  Because if I'm up 1,000, I'm so out of there.  Like, all right, that was fun.  But the only way you make...  I can't stop.  The only way you get up to 30,000 is by making the max table bet, which is 6,000.  So I was making $6,000 bets.  Jesus.  And, you know, I'd win.  I'd win.  It was like, holy shit.  You know, I just...  I hit a huge hand.  You know, I got blackjack twice in a row on $6,000 hands.  It takes a bite out of you as a person.  It certainly does. 
[02:08:00]  Because when you go and you sit all night, and you go up thousands of dollars, and then  you feel that losing it makes you sick to your stomach.  And then it's like 3 in the morning, go to sleep, and I had to wake up for a train the  next day.  And then I got to get up early, and I'm fucking...  I smoked cigarettes, because I always do the casinos.  You just feel like shit.  And I lost money, and I'm just...  Ugh.  A bite out of you doesn't...  I feel like an asshole.  Doesn't cover it.  It's like St. George took a bite out of Quint.  I fucking really...  Took a nibble on him, pasted him. 
[02:08:30]  Just took a little sliver.  Exactly.  And you're on a losing streak.  Am I on a losing streak now?  Yeah, the last few times.  I was on a big winning streak.  Although, the one we can't talk about, unfortunately.  I'm still ahead.  That was a biggie.  I'm still ahead, but I'm saving it for...  I'm saving all these losses for tax time.  There you go.  That's what I do.  There you go.  Hey, Jay, what's up, buddy?  It's a positive.  Jay Moore, everyone.  Oh, hi, Jay.  Welcome aboard.  I'm finally up early to call you guys.  I wanted to say, Louie, your stuff on... 
[02:09:00]  Every time I hear you on the show when I'm driving, your stuff about being a parent is  some of the most, like, insightful stuff I've ever heard.  I always go home and I tell my wife.  Because all your...  I know you guys are talking about gambling.  I'll tell you about gambling in two seconds.  But I really...  I don't know the next time I'll see Louie, but Jesus Christ, man.  It's funny.  It's hilarious.  It's insightful.  Oh, thanks, man.  Thank you, Jay Moore.  And you're onto something.  It's like, guys like you, that's where comedy's going.  It's just people telling the truth about not hitting your kid and saying, like, treating 
[02:09:30]  your kid like it's a goddamn product.  Like, hey, it works.  Thanks, man.  I just wanted to tell you, it really impressed me.  I was really...  I was over there in California listening to you and I thought, Jesus Christ, I've got  to go home and tell somebody this.  Thanks, man.  Thank you, Jay.  How about a compliment for some other friends?  Jay.  Jim, meza, meza.  I was a little surprised.  No.  Meza, meza.  Meza, meza.  All Jewish ladies.  My definition channel's right next to the regular channel, so I do keep going back and  forth to see the difference in your face. 
[02:10:00]  Hey, that's a good compliment.  Absolutely.  It's not bad.  And you can't see one.  It's fantastic.  If you're doing comedy for an hour, well, I mean, what am I supposed to say?  It's fucking Jim Norton for an hour.  It's the best.  Thank you, Jay.  Have you guys ever sat at a casino at a table and the dealer has, like, 20 or above for,  like, 15 straight hands where it's, Anthony, you seem to gamble the most here, right?  It's a mathematic impossibility.  I sound like Cato.  It's a mathematic impossibility.  Exactly.  But it isn't. 
[02:10:30]  I was at the Hard Rock Cafe and I lost three grand just because I wanted to see how often  the dealer was going to get 20 or above in a row.  And I stopped counting at 16 fucking hands.  Yeah, but, Jay, you know it's a mathematic certainty because it just happens.  Most cards are worth 10.  No, I mean, it's because there are more cards worth 10 than any of the other kind of cards.  Where are mine?  Where's Anthony's 20?  Shouldn't I get 20s as much as the dealer does? 
[02:11:00]  Here's the thing.  You know what cards you have.  You're just too stupid to fucking not double down with 15.  I just don't get it.  I should get 20s as much as the dealer does.  I should be able to pull 21s out of my ass with a 13 to start with.  No, 21s, no.  They do that.  Yeah, I know.  They sit there and go boom, boom, boom, lay out four.  When they start getting to the fifth card that they're throwing down and a face card hasn't  come out yet and then they just start taking your chips while you're on card three, you're 
[02:11:30]  still adding card three out of the five they have down there.  But they're taking your money because you know it's 21.  Bastards.  Nothing, Jay?  No comment on that, Jay Moore?  Jay, you started this 20 thing.  We were waiting for your comment.  No, it's the new me that tries not to interrupt.  Oh.  Nice.  Hey, this is kind of strange.  Do you know the joke about the guy, God tells the guy to go to play blackjack in Vegas? 
[02:12:00]  Do you know this one?  Yes.  No.  I do, actually.  Do you?  Yeah, God.  Jimmy knows it.  He just tells him, go about everything you own.  He takes everything out of the bank and then he sits down at the table.  He gets 18 and then God tells him, take a card.  And the guy's like, what are you talking about?  And the guy says, take a card.  He takes a card.  It's a two.  He's got 20.  God says, take another card.  And the dealer puts down a five and God goes, fuck. 
[02:12:30]  That was the shortest version of that joke ever because I don't want to get hung up on.  That's a funny joke.  That's a funny goddamn joke.  I heard it in a roulette.  Put it on black.  I heard it in a roulette form.  I knew where it was going.  That's pretty funny because you're expecting a whole twisty, quippy, God-y thing.  Right.  God-y thing.  But no, God just yells, fuck.  Yeah, but that's a bunch of bullshit because the Lord would know what cards are coming.  Of course he would.  He knows everything.  You know the joke about the Jewish guy and he's drowning and somebody comes by in a boat.  You want me to save you? 
[02:13:00]  He goes, no, God will save me.  So the boat keeps going and then the helicopter comes.  Come on, get on the helicopter.  No, God will save me.  All that shit.  Same too long joke.  Yeah.  And then he gets to, he dies and he meets God and he says, why didn't you save me?  And he goes, what?  I sent a boat.  I sent a helicopter.  But his joke would be like, then he goes to God, why didn't you save me?  And God says, shut up, you fucking Jew.  Which is a better punchline.  I'm like, shut up, you fucking Jew.  I mean, they are amazing, the Jew. 
[02:13:30]  There's a wonderful joke about a Jewish woman whose son is in the ocean and he's swimming.  And he begins to drown and she screams, help, my son is drowning.  Help.  And I think God somehow, what's God do?  He pushes the kid out of the water.  I don't remember the rest of the day.  Oh my God, Jimmy.  No, no, no.  I know, no, I know the joke.  Jay, can you tell it?  Because I know, it's funny, but I fucked it up.  Buddy Hackey used to say to his ex, the guy there, she goes, help, that old Jewish boy,  like, help, my son is drowning, my son is drowning. 
[02:14:00]  So, like, miraculously plucked this kid out of the ocean and, like, puts him on the blanket  on the beach and they're crying and hugging and the mom goes, hey, mister, he had a hat.  He had a hat.  Oh, God.  Oh, fucking Jews.  Oh, the Jews.  Oh, the goddamn Jews.  That's all I got.  Good night.  Take care, Jay.  Take it easy, Jay.  The great Jay Moore.  Thanks, man.  Jay is fucking, it's really hard to be funny on the phone.  Jay is funny on the phone.  Yeah, I know.  It's really hard to do.  That bastard is funny. 
[02:14:30]  My favorite of the night, though, is the roulette table, when we finally got up off the blackjack  table to make our fortune over at the roulette table.  Yeah, because when you lose your hundreds, and you go from the $100 table, which is guys  in tuxedos and James Bond and shit, and then you move over to the roulette table where it's  dollar chips and really dumb people who are very not white at all.  There were two black guys there.  Extremely not James Bond.  One guy that thought he was like Diamond Jim Brady, he's just, thinks he knows the game, 
[02:15:00]  trying to teach his buddy, who just knew shit, and he was just getting in the way and making  everything take forever.  I wanted to punch him in the face.  Oh, was he awful?  Put it on the number you think is good enough.  No, it's gotta be, you gotta be, it's a minimum, so you gotta put three of them on there, at least  three, no, no, now put the other, put them wherever you want.  Pick the number you think.  Oh, shit, shut up.  So, uh, Louie puts down, you know, some money and wins, right off the bat.  He had a nice little stack of chips.  I won like $400 in one roll.  Wow, nice.  And then he just looks at me and goes, this'll dissolve into nothing in no time, and it did. 
[02:15:30]  Yes.  Because I was putting $5 chips down, and I had like three chips on a number and hit it  directly, and it's 35 to 1.  Sure.  Yeah.  That's when you should walk away.  That ain't happening.  Huge stack of $5 chips.  Walk away!  As a matter of fact, it would have erased what I lost at the blackjack table.  But it was like the first fucking spin of the wheel.  What, are you gonna leave?  No.  I don't have the bug, because if that happens, I'm walking.  Oh, no.  It's like, okay, cool.  That's what you're hoping for. 
[02:16:00]  It happened, so it's time to walk.  Yep.  No, you just gotta...  I didn't even tip the valet guy.  That's how bad I lost.  Really?  To avert my gaze and get in the car quickly.  Are you a big gambler?  Yes, gambler.  Put up the window and fucking go.  Big gambler?  Only when I go to those places.  I don't gamble on sports, and I don't go to them on purpose.  I can get sucked in a little bit when I'm there, but I don't, like, search it out  on my own.  If I'm there for a show or what have you, then, sure, I'll join the fun, but...  You know what I understood what gambling was and why I don't do it?  I was in Vegas one time, and I don't, and I walk by one of those tables where they have  like a wheel with dollars on it, a 20 and a 10, and you put down and you bet, and I 
[02:16:30]  put a single on 20, and it hit 20, and my first thought was, why didn't I bet 20?  That would have been 400.  That's it.  That's exactly what it is, man.  It's fucking that little moment you have, which for the rest of your gambling career...  No, that's when you're playing blackjack and you've been betting $100 hands, and then  you decide to taper off and you put 20 on a hand, and they give you an ace first, and  you literally say, don't give me blackjack.  You're like, don't give me fucking blackjack now, you son of a bitch. 
[02:17:00]  I don't want the money.  Don't want it.  Because it should have been 100.  And then they give you blackjack, and you go, that figures, that's what I say.  That figures.  I go, where was that last hand?  Thanks for the $30, you cunt.  Yeah, fuck it.  Just throw it at her head.  Throw the fucking chip.  Here's your tip, you fuck.  Take it.  Put my feet up on the table so Pesci can slap me in the face.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, asshole!  You guys suck!  Serious Exxon. 
[02:17:30]  We got Dane Cook outside the studio with Bob Kelly.  Yeah, good Dane in here.  Just have him walk in.  Dane, what's up, brother?  Look who's got to take the fucking couch.  Oh, Bobby.  What?  What's wrong with the...  Bobby's got to take the couch.  It's the first time he's ever been asked to sit on the couch.  You see they put the big shot over there.  That was just hurtful and mean.  I'm kidding, Bob.  Settle down.  I was just talking to him about the Propecia and the Rogaine.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I think I want hair again. 
[02:18:00]  I think I might go the way of the Anthony.  You've got to go to the follicle.  I'm getting a great mullet growing back here.  I've got a video.  I've got to get rid of this.  I sure bought it.  Can I have some of your mullet?  Yeah, I'll get it from the donor area.  What's your video?  I took the Propecia and I started cumming yellow chunks.  What?  For real?  Honest to God.  You're supposed to put it on your head.  Bob is dipping his cock in Propecia.  He's got really hairy balls.  He's killing his dick holes.  What the fuck are you doing?  You know what, dude? 
[02:18:30]  You're bald.  You put the hair back on.  Boom.  You got hair again.  Cup of coffee.  Cigarette.  We're a hat.  Dane said he's got a video.  What's the video?  Jay Hall's brother from Chicago had our first, it was 92, and it's all of us doing our stand-up  and then sketches.  It's the whole show.  Wow.  Yeah, we did improv, which is one letter short of improved.  No, no, no.  Right here.  Here's our improv.  Here's our improv.  We're so savvy.  We're on stage and we're like, all right, we need a fake movie. 
[02:19:00]  And, you know, improv is like the first thing somebody yells out, we're sifting through  all the options.  Guy's like, ghost house, and we're looking at each other.  Nah, what else?  Keep yelling.  Pick a better one.  Until you yell something we've done before.  It's fucking improv.  You're supposed to just go with the first one.  No.  Nah.  Improv stinks.  I just hate it.  You know, my girl's taking an improv class and she actually gave me the book on, like, 
[02:19:30]  you know, how to do improv and everything.  And the amount of swipes they take at stand-up comedians.  Oh, you're shitting me, really?  I was reading it on the plane.  I just kept going like, yeah, they're just like, you know, this isn't like a stand-up  comedian where it's all been rehearsed time and time again.  Sure, there might be a little bit of improv.  It's just like.  Yeah, it's great.  If I wrote a book about stand-up, at no point would I feel the need to take a swipe at people  who do improv.  Because they're fucking jealous that they, I'm telling you, improv people are fucking jealous 
[02:20:00]  that they can't just stand there with a microphone.  They need eight other people.  And when they run out of fucking steam, they yell, tag, and the next asshole comes and  bails them out.  We don't have that option.  You think I don't want to yell, tag, sometimes?  I'm fucking eating my balls?  Please come up and help me.  Now, wasn't that improv right there?  Did you have all that written?  I said that actually yesterday morning, exact same time.  Every morning, same thing.  I tried it on 800 different radio stations before I came.  That's what I was thinking.  I was thinking, Opie and Anthony show you improv every day.  Oh my God, we don't know what the fuck we're going to say next.  We're reading a teleprompter right now. 
[02:20:30]  Right, yeah.  The whole rule of improv, too, like number one golden rule.  Don't deny.  Don't deny.  And our whole thing was deny.  We would just, we would mess with each other.  You know, you'd be like, oh, you know, obviously holding like a fake baby rocket.  Why are you carrying your own tire from your car?  It would just, we would destroy each other with deny.  That's great.  Like comedy cock block.  You guys are all the biggest assholes out there. 
[02:21:00]  Comics are just assholes.  Don't let anything go.  Sometimes the problems will be false.  I just found that fucking, this just sucks.  I ordered an egg white almond with ham, and there was a carrot in the middle of it.  Why egg whites with ham?  Fuck, why is there orange?  Like, why bother with the ham?  If you're going to have the ham, you might as well just go all in with the eggs.  Go with the yolk.  The yolk is the best taste of heart.  I like egg white.  And douse it in salt and pepper.  The only time I like the yolk is when it's gooey. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah, you could have it like loose.  When you bite it in a sandwich, it just shoots out, then you wipe it up with a fucking...  Some toast.  Yeah.  Good shit right there, man.  Don't get me going on fat stories.  Don't get me going.  I actually was in Miami Improv.  I went to El Polo Trabajal and ordered $40 worth of meat.  The next year I went back, they remembered me.  They were like, oh, you last time here.  What the most meat ever.  Remember we had like that session at Fogo? 
[02:22:00]  A session?  We sat there so long that the knives were dull by the time the check came.  How about the other night?  We were working out for like two weeks straight, eating egg whites and chicken breasts.  Oh, yeah.  And then I brought up McDonald's for some reason.  Oh, no.  How I hate getting fries.  One fry, large fry.  Because it ends.  You know, you get to the end.  Yeah.  And you're like, ah, that's that one mushy fry at the end that you try to...  Should I dip it in ketchup?  Should I eat it raw? 
[02:22:30]  How should I enjoy it?  You eat a large fry and you're upset that it ends?  Dude.  Dude, fat people make food so fucking gross.  He goes...  They just make it gross.  So he tells me, he goes, well, do what I used to do.  I used to get three large fries, put them in a bag.  That way, I'm not going to eat them all, but they never end.  Oh, holy shit, it's never ending.  That's such a great way to go about it.  I thought it was fantastic.  We're talking about it.  Then we decide we're going to do it one day.  You just eat it until you sleep.  We decide we're going to do it one day.  And then it turns into either tomorrow night or the next night.  And then we're driving by McDonald's after the gig. 
[02:23:00]  And we're like, dude, there's a McDonald's.  And we're going back and forth.  All of a sudden, this stupid limo driver just turns in.  Turned in.  He made the decision for you.  We weren't going to say yes for the whole time.  We're like, yeah, dude, there it is.  There it is.  And this guy just gets in the drive-thru.  We just froze and stared at each other.  And he did that thing where he pulled up so the mic was next to the back window.  So we had the entire option to be like, no, we're good.  Two double quarter pounders with cheese.  A shake.  Ten chicken McNuggets. 
[02:23:30]  Three fries.  Each.  Each.  Each.  They did drop new fries for us.  That's pretty.  Then we got on the plane.  We had Tyson documentary.  And then we ate all the food.  I thought it was fucking hallucinating.  Yeah.  Because we saw the northern lights.  We're coming from Alaska.  So I look out the window and it's just green and purple.  I'm like, I'm dying.  I caught diabetes. 
[02:24:00]  He's got like so full of trans fast.  He can't recognize colors anymore.  That's fucked up.  You know what's funny though?  Is you sit there and you say you're not going to eat.  You're not going to eat.  But the second you get a whiff of that grease.  It's over.  It's fucking over.  It's one of the great smells that's on this planet.  You guys like the Tyson documentary?  How great was that?  To see Tyson have a fucking brain.  Yeah, man.  He's really.  He's like Mensa smart, man.  That guy was.  Absolutely.  No one knew that.  So intelligent.  And then we watched Anvil.  Have you seen that documentary?  I love Anvil.  I had Anvil in here. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  It was so great.  It's good to know that they're doing okay.  Yeah.  But now I heard they're going to do the soundtrack for like Iron Man 2.  Yeah.  Now they're as big as you can get.  That's incredible.  I wanted to see that one.  Because they didn't make it.  Like it's a fucking paradox.  They made it because they hadn't made it for so long.  Yeah, that's what I'm hoping for.  And that's the only way they made it.  I'm hoping to make a documentary next year.  Have you seen it in?  No, I haven't seen it yet.  No, you've seen it?  No, I didn't see it.  I got it.  I thought I didn't believe it was.  You feel so bad for the one guy because he's just believing in the dream that he should 
[02:25:00]  have gave up on 20 years ago.  He's got the lip quiver.  Yeah.  Okay.  We're going to do this.  We have to all agree that it will.  He was just freezing in the meat locker where he works.  And then they go to.  No.  What do you have to do?  He had to deliver meals.  He had to deliver meals to the elderly or something in the middle of winter.  But this is the worst part.  The bass player, who's the shit out in any band, he was his boss at the fucking vegetable 
[02:25:30]  factory or wherever the fuck he worked.  So he's the one who makes all the vegetables and puts them in the tins.  This asshole has to go get it from the bass player.  And he's got an attitude and shit.  Like he has a chef's jacket on.  And he's fucking mixing vegetables.  You know, everybody who works at the restaurant makes fun of them.  Why are they still in the long hair?  Dude, they're in a band.  He walks by, they're like, metal on metal.  I love documentaries.  Talking about forks.  This is one of the best documentaries, though.  I mean, they're at the big, huge festivals in Europe. 
[02:26:00]  And the guys that they came up with could give a shit that they're there.  And they're all excited.  Like, Lars is going to recognize them and stuff.  Oh, wow.  Oh, they just get the cold shoulder from everybody else in the business.  And his own kid.  And whenever your kid is like, you know, they're like, what do you think of your dad's music?  And the kid's like, yeah.  At least to have the kid be like, no, my dad rocks.  That would, like, fill me up.  And instead, I ate two more large fries and stared at the northern lights.  And the family doesn't believe in him anymore.  Our sister.  The sister's still giving him money to keep his dream alive because she's very rich, I guess. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  He's fighting with club owners over $100 fucking, you know, $100 for a gig or something.  All right, I got to see this now.  Fucking Germany.  Oh, you're going to love it.  Did you guys see, uh...  What about the tour manager crying on the train tracks?  Yeah, but she wasn't even a tour manager, right?  She was just a fan from Europe who wrote them and was like, I believe in you.  Yeah, but she kept fucking everything up.  Taking buses and rickshaws and shit.  That sounds like Spinal Tap.  Totally like, it's shit, gets in charge and fucks things up. 
[02:27:00]  I mean, the train goes and they're still on the platform and she breaks down crying.  And then, I forgot their names, but they're like, what do you mean you didn't buy tickets?  Yeah.  And now they're just stuck in the middle of Europe with no fucking plan and she's crying.  I have no heart for anybody who goes with the excuse of, I'm trying so hard for you.  How about fucking prepare a year in advance instead of trying to wing my career?  I am doing everything that I can to... 
[02:27:30]  What?  You made one phone call to see if a train was coming.  Can you imagine if Barry Katz doing that to you, Dean?  I can imagine.  I witnessed it first.  It's called the first five years of my career.  There's Alex out there.  There's the fucking...  What's up, Alex?  That's the man right there.  Alex is the main guy now?  We call him Tree Face.  Alex.  Yeah?  What's Alex all about?  Old man in a tree.  What the fuck?  Look at him.  Look at him.  You know what that reminds me of when you talk about that whole, I'm trying? 
[02:28:00]  I was sitting...  One of my pet peeves is when you're sitting in the green room at a club and there's no  waitress and there's no water, there's no food or anything.  So three times I got to ask to get a waitress to come back.  I'm fucking starving before I do a show.  So finally this waitress comes walking in and she just goes, oh my God, I'm like the worst  waitress ever.  And I go, really?  Well, can you send the good one back here?  It's like, what?  Because you called yourself out for sucking?  Now I'm supposed to accept it?  Oh, now it's funny.  Now it's funny because you said you suck. 
[02:28:30]  So now I can just enjoy it.  Now you go, oh my God, I'm the worst tipper ever.  So this is a great combination.  She read one of those dumb books about you got to own your own stuff so that nobody can  take your power and fuck with it.  So she came in.  I am the worst tipper.  What's my move on the chessboard?  How to suck and still succeed.  Just admit to it before somebody calls you out on it.  There you go.  But you know what?  You take it to another level of like, yeah, your boyfriend must hate you. 
[02:29:00]  Just something weird when she walks away.  Like, what?  I'm a bad waitress, but I'm not a bad girlfriend.  I'm not just going to spit in your food.  Do you worry about that?  She probably will.  At a comedy club?  Well.  Probably make it taste better.  Fucking shitholes.  Stupid chicken wings.  We were talking about this last night.  Quesadillas.  Oh, fucking dumb quesadillas and skirt steak.  Fucking poor man's steak.  When you meet somebody and you go, oh, it's really nice too.  I meet you.  And they go, we've actually met before. 
[02:29:30]  They pull that in front of other people.  This girl, oh, hey, yeah, it's cool.  Nice to meet you.  No, we actually meet, we met before.  And I'm just staring at her and everybody's kind of looking into that awkward moment.  I'm like, oh, yeah.  Yeah, what's up?  What's going on?  You don't remember.  That's what I get.  You don't really remember.  I love that one too where it's like, hey, how you doing?  You're like, hey, what's up?  You don't remember me, do you?  It's like, why do you got to put me in that fucking position?  No, I don't.  You know, we kind of meet.  No, I absolutely don't.  We meet a few people, you know, I might not remember fucking, you know. 
[02:30:00]  I have cousins that don't even know their fucking names.  Yeah, exactly.  People in my family at barbecues, like, who's that little cute girl?  You don't remember when they go, and they know the time limit you talked?  We talked for like a half hour at a party.  Oh, really?  Or they go, all right, what's my name?  Because sometimes I try to bluff and go, do you remember me?  I go, yeah, hell yeah.  What's my name?  All right, look, I gave you an out to feel good.  Now I'm just going to dive on you.  I have no fucking clue who you are.  I don't care about you.  I'm even bad if I know people. 
[02:30:30]  Sometimes I get like a panic, like, oh, fuck.  If I was working with these two guys, I've known these guys for like 17 years.  If I was working with them just as a backup plan, I'm such a moron.  And if I was hosting the show, I would write their names on my hands.  Not these guys, but you know what I mean?  Like, guys, you know what I mean?  I would literally have to be writing that.  That was my big panic as a host that I was going to forget the name.  I've had people come up and I'm like, all right, someone's coming.  I know the face.  I don't know the fucking name.  So you turn to whoever you're with and go, all right, I'll say hello. 
[02:31:00]  Immediately introduce yourself.  Yes.  And I'll be like, I'll be like, oh, I'm so rude.  I'm sorry.  And then right when they say the name, you go like, Karen, Karen, this is Karen.  To try to make it seem like you knew who it was.  It is totally a timing thing.  And then I blame myself.  I'm like, oh, I'm so fucking rude.  I'm sorry.  Yes, of course.  I thought you guys met, but you guys didn't meet before?  Yeah, I thought you did.  Fuck, I'm the asshole.  I got that worked out with my girlfriend.  That's the deal.  That's me too.  If I don't introduce you.  Immediately.  Yes, don't get mad.  In the first three seconds, introduce yourself. 
[02:31:30]  And go, he's rude.  Yes.  And you know what the worst thing is?  Right.  The worst thing is when your girl says, you know, hey, I'm Karen.  And then the other guy goes, oh, hey, how's it going?  You're like, fuck, say your name.  Say your name.  Say your name.  Okay.  And then here's your job to get both their names.  I get so paranoid with being the guy that goes out, what's up, bro?  Because usually, hey, what's up, bro?  What's up, man?  Leads to it.  That used to work.  Then I try to get clever, and I'm like, muchacho.  And I end up calling him some weird.  You're going to Chief Champ.  You're going everywhere.  What the fuck is your name?  What's up, lips?  I get my nickname. 
[02:32:00]  Captain.  The fucking bro thing used to work, though.  You could get out of situations.  You're just saying, hey, bro, what's up, man?  Here's the worst one I've had recently.  I went to town to this club, and there was some guy, some chef at a restaurant, right?  He was a big fan.  So, yeah, come on down.  So we go down there, and this guy feeds us like it's the last Thanksgiving ever.  Everything on the menu.  It was, like, bizarre.  Like, we had, like, shrimp, and then waffles came out.  It was unreal, but it was all delicious.  And I hung out and talked to this guy for 45 minutes.  And he goes, yeah, I'm coming out to the late show tonight.  I go, all right, dude.  Well, hang on. 
[02:32:30]  I'll get you a DVD.  Thank you so much, blah, blah, blah.  So the end of the show, the guy stands in line like a regular person.  So I'm totally in robot mode going, hey, did you have a good time?  All right, thanks a lot.  So the guy who just made me a free meal, I'm talking.  He's like, hey, what's going on?  I'm like, hey, man, did you have a good time?  Do you want a DVD or something like that?  And the guy's looking at me, and I totally didn't even recognize him.  Did he pay for it?  No, he ended up walking away.  And then the middle act comes up to me, and he goes, oh, did you sing Chef Chris?  Chef Chris came out. 
[02:33:00]  I go, oh, fuck.  I had a panic.  No, no, but I went down to his restaurant the next day with DVD in hand.  I was just like, dude, you got to understand, people come up to you, and they say, my brother  just died.  He liked your comedy.  They're just like bizarre shit.  People slapping you on the back.  He's like, yeah, thanks.  Go fuck yourself.  I was still full from what the guy fucking cooked me, and I couldn't remember him.  Just wanted to make sure that's shrimp and, what was it, waffles? 
[02:33:30]  Yeah, it was shrimp and waffles.  Is he a chef at a fucking IHOP?  No, it's a waffles.  Isn't that Paul Ponson album?  Shrimp and waffles.  Have you ever had taken a shrimp and waffles and shrimp and waffles?  It's the most delicious thing that you could possibly be to kiss us, the shrimp and waffles.  She's brilliant.  I'm leaning over a stool and contorting myself into shrimp and waffles.  Fucking Dave.  Oh, goddamn. 
[02:34:00]  Paul's house down.  What the fuck?  Oh, she sucks.  Oh, those early 90s Doc Martens.  Yeah.  We got it.  You're gay.  Did you ever watch the Young Comedian specials?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And just watch how fucking atrocious comedy was back then?  Even the name guys were like, you know.  You watch the old one.  Because I remember seeing the one with Seinfeld on it and fucking shit.  And you watch the act and go like, wow.  I saw one they did in New York and some gay guy with fucking just great hair.  Some what?  And a big gay guy. 
[02:34:30]  Robert Kelly.  No, I said great hair.  Oh, that was back in the day you did?  I did.  You're a model, motherfucker.  You're some men that are gorgeous.  I could have been in Menudo.  And he had the fuzziest pink.  It was just this hairy, fuzzy pink sweater.  Right.  It was so hot.  He just made the wrong choice in wardrobe.  And he was sweating the whole time.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That music.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah. 
[02:35:00]  It was always like a Casio keyboard with some really cheesy saxophone.  There's always a bouncer at the front door of the club.  Yeah.  He's like, you can't tell me.  And they turn.  And they do the fake freeze, but they're still kind of moving.  And there's the name.  And then when they show the performer, he's got to do that surprise look.  Like, he doesn't know the camera.  Like, the double take.  Huh?  Hey!  Then he runs to the backside entrance.  And he enters this.  It's a bad cut to the stage, too.  It's like, no.  I'm running right from the alley.  Right on down. 
[02:35:30]  Back then, balance is all wrong.  He's gotten a haircut since the opening show.  He's like, he's got a haircut.  One comic's putting his fucking jacket in a locker.  Like, comics get lockers.  God damn, those were really.  They're on a, like, HBO classic now.  Every so often, they pop on.  And you're like, you see these guys that wound up becoming huge.  And then these other guys are like, who's that?  Yeah.  That's like, he just fucking muddled his way through comedy clubs and never made a dent. 
[02:36:00]  Nothing.  Nothing.  That gay guy with the pink sweater was just sweating his whole set.  Do you remember there was a guy on Stand Up Spotlight.  Every time he would do, when he would finish his act, he would do a backflip.  That's my God.  And he'd do a backflip.  And they'd do, like, this big, like he was doing the YMCA.  He'd just do the Y.  He would do that.  And I remember this before I got in comedy, and I was embarrassed.  I actually liked a guy.  I was literally, like, the moron comedy fan.  Like, this is the guy who does the backflip. 
[02:36:30]  He's the backflip guy.  I totally saw.  I hope he's in a motorized wheelchair now running it with his mouth because he fucked up one night.  I used to do comedy.  I did a backflip.  What's the comic's name that was in the wheelchair where you used to forget him upstairs all the time at the end of the show?  Oh, yeah.  He had the mustache.  Matt Malley.  Matt Malley.  What?  Is he a Boston guy?  Yeah.  It was, like, there was, like, fucking three huge flights of stairs to get up to the comedy club, and there was just a big, huge picture window.  Yeah.  And we'd all, a great show. 
[02:37:00]  We'd be up front, hanging out, smoking butts.  We'd always look up and just see him steaming up the window because we forgot him upstairs.  Yeah, but his wheelchair was, like, the template wheel.  It was, like, made of concrete.  It was the heaviest thing you ever tried.  An alloy that was, like, found on Mars.  It was six of us.  It was, like, the Flintstone wheelchair.  You're, like, wheels made out of stone.  Everybody used to be.  He had a teak backboard on.  Dude, that guy one time, he booked me at a, he told me it was a high school. 
[02:37:30]  He goes, I got a gig.  It's a high school.  Me and, remember, Jim Dunn?  Yeah.  He goes, me, Jim Dunn, and Matt Malley books us at this high school, right?  And we're sitting there going, like, oh, my God, this is going to be brutal.  It's a high school.  What the fuck am I going to talk about?  What am I going to talk about?  Dude, we show up.  It's a junior high.  Holy shit.  We're standing backstage.  The kids are so young, their voices haven't even changed yet, so it's just to see if,  hey, hey, hey, hey.  We're just sitting there going, like, oh, my God, we're going to die. 
[02:38:00]  I hope you get the backflip.  Yeah.  Is this backflip guy?  So the principal shows up, who actually looks like an ex-marine or, like, a janitor.  He goes, all right, I'm doing the intros.  What do you got me to say?  So he tells me intros.  And he comes walking out.  And the kids are like, hey.  This is the intro.  He goes, and we are quiet, please.  And everybody just shuts up.  Oh, shit.  And he starts berating them.  Saying if anybody says, you know, yells out anything, they're getting detention and all  that.  So I think, and we were so, how did it go? 
[02:38:30]  I forget the lineup.  But all I remember was, I think me and Jim went on first.  And then Matt was closing it out.  And he was eating his balls.  His numb nuts just sitting there.  And we sat back there and enjoyed it.  We were so fucking mad at him.  He was nuts.  We were so mad at him for booking it.  We just sat.  It was the best part.  It was worth eating my balls out in front of him.  He was nervously rolling back and forth.  Oh, yeah.  I did a gig.  He booked me.  He booked me and Aldo Benny at the White Stallion.  It was just like a bikey bar way up in New Hampshire. 
[02:39:00]  And we're hanging out.  It's just a hell gig.  It's just terrible.  And the owner comes out to start the show.  And he's shit-faced.  He grabs the mic.  He goes, all right.  We start the show.  There's like four people, drunk fucking milf.  And he goes, all right.  We're going to bring up the first guy.  He's in a wheelchair.  Oh, shit.  Get this.  This is how it happened.  He was emptying a fish tank out the window.  And it pulled him out.  And he fell on his neck and snapped his neck.  And he paralyzed himself. 
[02:39:30]  He goes, hey, Matt, why didn't you fucking let go of the fish tank, stupid?  Matt Malley, everybody.  And then he wheels up.  That might be the best intro I've ever heard.  I'm not going to say the comic's name, just out of being nice.  But there was a comic who used to have a lazy eye.  And he was unbelievably sensitive about it.  Unbelievably sensitive.  So I'm bombing.  It's this hell gig.  It's a two-story bar.  And we're upstairs.  And they have like screen windows.  There's like a carnival across the street. 
[02:40:00]  It was just fucking horrific.  So the dude goes up to host the show.  He's all excited because he finally has a room to do with a lazy eye.  And then literally he gets like, hey, how's everybody doing?  And like the guys from like Time to Kill are literally sitting in the front row.  And the guy just looks right at him.  And he goes, dude, what the fuck is wrong with your eye?  Right?  He had nothing.  He was just standing there going like, I can't believe you said that.  You'd think he'd have something.  You'd think he would have worked on his lazy eye material. 
[02:40:30]  And then he's trying to get pity from all these other people playing like pinball.  They don't even give a shit.  Can you believe someone would say something like that?  Why would you be so mean?  I know what you're talking about.  I want to come back for that.  It wasn't even, it wasn't even, who?  Oh, yeah.  Remember the guy, who was the guy that had this, who would bleed?  Because he had that skin disease and he would just bleed?  How do I forget that guy?  The guy, remember he was just red all the time.  He was always red.  And then he would, he would bleed.  He'd have to have a napkin because his lips would chap up so bad and his face would chap up. 
[02:41:00]  He would just start bleeding.  And then you'd go to eat with him after.  I used to have to tell him, go sit on the table because you're bleeding.  I can't watch you dab blood onto a fucking tissue.  It was like his whole body was chapped lips.  And if he would go to, he was shiny because he always had to grease.  He had to dip his head in grease before he went out.  Oh, my God.  I remember that guy.  Holy shit.  You remember that guy?  I don't know.  Was he funny at least?  No.  No.  Scaly.  What the fuck did he have? 
[02:41:30]  Dude, I don't know.  But he was shiny all the time because he had to always condition his face.  And he would bleed.  Like, on stage, he'd have a napkin dab.  Because when he'd tell a joke, his lip would crack sometimes and just start bleeding.  And just start bleeding?  Oh.  That's horrible.  I was awful.  What affliction is that there's no God.  You just took the fun out of the room with that story.  There's no God.  There's no God.  Where do we go with that one?  Makes you bleed.  It's almost maybe gag.  I'm getting crazy signs.  We got to get Dean out of here. 
[02:42:00]  He's got stuff to do.  Okay.  Okay.  Are you sticking around, though, Bobby?  How'd you burn, by the way, Bobby?  Yeah, it's good.  What happened?  You all right?  Oh, this cock's fucking...  Hey, hey, hey.  Hey.  You know, we're...  Hey.  You know, we're...  Now it's six minutes.  You fuck around.  Easy.  Easy.  Yeah, I'll fuck it.  You just called me a cock blank.  You burned me.  You just called me a cock blank.  That's hilarious.  Now I'm going to do 28.  Hi, Bobby.  Just bring people up.  I'm lighting on your intro.  Oh, fuck you, both ears.  That's kind of funny. 
[02:42:30]  That's kind of funny.  I'm going to bump into your time.  And I'm going to do the whole show.  Just annoy everybody.  Every little girl's going to go, what the fuck?  I, uh...  You know, we fuck around backstage all the time.  We throw shit at each other and fucking whip each other with coat hangers and just punch  each other in the face.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah.  This fucking dummy grabs a...  What was it?  What did you do first?  Let's start with the...  I hit him in the nuts.  Yeah.  With a Fuji bottle.  Which immediately takes you to DEF CON, you know, I'm doing anything I can to get back 
[02:43:00]  to you.  I have to go on stage in 10 minutes.  You just hit me with your...  You know, in the nuts.  I got to go on stage in fucking 13 seconds and you burnt me with a fucking flat iron.  That is true.  What?  He pinched my elbow with a flat iron.  Jesus Christ.  But this is his theory.  He goes, dude, I didn't know it was that hot.  I put it on my head all the time.  I go, dude, it's a fucking...  The word iron is in it.  It's fucking...  Dude, he's got the John Bender, do I stutter, burn.  Holy shit.  This is what you get...  What's wrong with you?  When you open for Dane and spill paint in the garage, do I stutter? 
[02:43:30]  Oh, you're getting one tonight.  Smoke him up, Johnny.  Yeah.  I know Dane's had a tough year, but I was fucking taking it on his fucking friends.  I was...  You know when somebody burns you and you...  Holy shit.  He's testing your loyalty.  Some accidental shit happens and you get fucking angry and you're...  You hit me in the balls, though.  Yeah, dude, you fucking burned me.  Yeah, but you can still be a father after that one.  No, it sounds like you hit him in the balls first.  He did.  He did.  No, no.  I was second.  He actually...  Sir, sir, he did. 
[02:44:00]  He did.  Who's sir?  You started it.  No, I'm sir today.  Sir Missy changes the whole mood.  I'm the judge.  It became testimony.  I'm the jury right here.  All right, here we go.  All right, ready?  Let's fucking...  I was trying to get the tattoo so I could ruin it.  You don't like that tattoo either, do you?  No, no.  We hate it.  Are you really...  We just haven't told him to his face yet.  Are you done?  Shut your face.  Is it a dragon, Bob?  Yeah.  It's a koi.  No, no, no.  It's a dragon.  Where's the koi?  Is it a fish?  That one's over here.  Oh, I'm sorry. 
[02:44:30]  Can you get a picture of you, tattoo of you like fly fishing?  I just remembered.  I hate two of your...  What's that?  On your other shoulder with like the big rubber pants?  Look, we got to get things out of their pacing.  What's that?  Tell your story.  Get a tattoo of you like fly fishing on your arm.  Be a cool one, man.  Yeah.  Big rubber pants.  Be like an action one where you can tell like the thing's moving and you just...  You found your piece.  If I flex my muscles, the fucking...  He does have a good whip.  Okay.  But I burnt you once.  But how many times do I give you a big hug and I say, Bobby, I want you to be your best  tonight and I really want to see you succeed.  Go out and make these people laugh. 
[02:45:00]  How many times do I embrace you at that?  What are you, Bon Jovi?  What the fuck is wrong with you?  How many times do I tell you I believe in you?  Yeah, that's so nice, Bobby.  Yeah, why would you hit him in the balls like that?  Yeah, see?  First of all, we were fucking around.  Who's the judge?  You the judge?  I'm the judge.  You're the jury?  I'm not a fan of hanging out with guys that like to do ball shots.  I have a brother that's into that.  My brother is so into just ball shotting guys.  What happened?  Did you burn your retinas looking up at the big Dane Cook sign as you walked into the  arena? 
[02:45:30]  Is that too mean?  A little bit.  A little bit.  I took a couple shots.  You're going to do it tonight anyways.  Exactly.  What the fuck are you talking about?  That's what I thought.  I thought it was going to be funny.  Like a couple of lugs sitting at a lunch counter.  It wasn't that it wasn't funny.  It was just too wordy.  You're just fucking looking up at the thing and the retinas and the body.  There's a lot of body parts.  I just don't want to be in trouble for keeping Dane in studio too long.  There's no story.  He was fucking with me.  So you ball shot him.  No, he was fucking with me, antagonizing me.  What was I doing?  I don't know.  You're doing some horse shit. 
[02:46:00]  You're doing some stupid shit.  You were doing some shit in my face and he did something.  Why did it involve some kind of movement?  It had movement.  I don't know why.  That's all I remember is movement.  It's good to know you guys hate each other.  I love this.  I love it.  I love it.  So I took the bottle and I didn't throw it like a fucking baseball pitcher.  I tossed it.  A little Fiji bottle.  Tossed it.  It was like a ski ball toss.  Oh, really?  I'm not that good at ski ball though.  Yeah.  He was going for the hundred point.  Hit him in the nut and then he grabbed the iron and pinched my elbow.  Wow, that's fucking great.  We got to hang out.  Yeah. 
[02:46:30]  You're sick like me.  I wish I had it on video.  Yeah.  You videotape everything.  You don't have that?  What are you talking about?  You videotape me fucking my knee.  When I broke my fucking leg, this cocksucker, I look up, he's looking at the camera lady  who wanted to put the camera down and felt bad.  I see him doing the rolls, keep rolling sign, pointing at her.  Old school too, right?  Old school.  Keep rolling.  But he pointed at her.  I saw her point at her and go, you fucking keep rolling.  And then he does the roll and she puts the camera back up with a tear in her eye. 
[02:47:00]  That's a great moment though.  He captured a man recognizes drama.  That's a true producer though.  I told him, I said, Bobby, I know that a month later you would have been like this.  Dude, you should have rolled in that dude.  You should have.  See, I did it for you, Bobby.  It's one of the greatest video clips ever.  I'm going to get you the clip that I just got of Bobby and I in 1992.  Oh good, please.  It's crazy weird.  Is this the red VCR tape?  You know what you're doing?  You know what you're doing?  It's our first paid gig, like a check. 
[02:47:30]  And Bobby, you were like mad at Al who was videoing.  And you go on a rant, a Bobby rant.  Maybe one of the first ones.  I think I might have captured the first like.  Bobby rant.  Bobby rant.  He's like, dude, I told you, dude.  None of you guys believed in it.  I said, we're going to get paid, dude.  And now we're getting paid.  And his hair is just all over the place.  Like Pirates of the Penzance hair.  You know, just.  And now look, dude.  Look at the check.  We get the check.  It's like 85 bucks.  You got to see it.  Please get it to me.  We'll put that up on a YouTube channel. 
[02:48:00]  That should be fun.  What is going on?  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Sirius XM.  Spanking of the kids.  Where are you staying?  We all got spanked growing up, right?  We all got hit.  We got spanked.  I got spanked on the front.  My dad would.  I can't even make the joke.  It was that awful.  It's that bad.  Yeah, my parents would.  He would hold your dick in his hand and slap it like that.  With his face.  With his face.  I wasn't going to say that. 
[02:48:30]  I was actually going to just do it.  I'm glad you did.  I had the image already.  And then it went into motion.  Like it moved.  Why can't you make the joke?  My parents listen to the show sometimes.  And there's certain things I just can't say.  They're starting to.  I do love my girlfriend though.  She's so nice.  We do a little trick.  She'll go to kiss my cheek and I'll turn and plant one on her lips.  That's adorable.  But I do that right after I eat another girl's pussy.  I think growing up, if you're at a certain age, you got spanked. 
[02:49:00]  That's, you know, it's just the way things work.  When did that end?  When did the time out start?  Louie, you had the kids.  I got kids and we don't spank them.  I don't believe you.  So you're like the barrier.  You're the generation that got spanked.  I know what it did to me.  I ain't going to do it to another kid.  It horrified me as a kid.  It did not help me at all.  I don't speak to my father.  No, it's one of those things that, like, they were bad spankies.  Yeah, I, you know something?  Well, there's a difference.  I don't either.  Yeah.  I don't talk to my father. 
[02:49:30]  No.  I've been dead 10 years.  I can, because I remember.  Wait, Lou, you don't talk to your dad?  Well, no, we're starting to reconcile now because I'm finally beyond my problems.  So we're starting to be friends now, my dad.  Are you?  Yeah.  But for a lot of years, I didn't speak to him.  Yeah.  That's got to hurt.  I guess.  Well, you know, it's one of those family things.  You don't want shit getting in the way.  Well, it's like, I think, I remember my dad, he would lecture me first and tell me why  he's going to, which is like torture.  That's fucking A, man. 
[02:50:00]  Here's why you're getting spanked.  And I remember standing there thinking the instant I'm old enough, I'm getting the fuck  away from this man and never seeing him again.  My mother used to hit me, but with her, it was different because she was overworked.  She was a single, my parents got divorced.  She was a single mom, tired.  Yeah.  Shut up.  Bang.  I totally relate to that.  If you're a parent and you're overwrought and you just out of frustration need to hit  your kid just to settle, you just to center yourself.  I totally understand.  Center yourself.  I understand. 
[02:50:30]  I sympathize with it.  Yeah.  But the idea of hitting kids methodically as a way to discipline them, I just, I don't  think, I think it's wrong.  I don't think it's like morally wrong.  I just don't think it works.  I would get, it doesn't work.  I would get the strap, the fucking belt would come off.  My dad had the belt.  He had the belt and he would like, one time I, uh, I was walking my bike across the street  and we had hedges that were higher than I was.  And I decided I was just going to walk out in the street and not look for any cars coming 
[02:51:00]  or anything.  I don't know why I decided to do this.  I just walked my bike out in the middle of the street and a car, like jammed on the  brakes.  He's yelling at me and my father was in the yard and saw this happen.  So he's like, what the fuck?  Grabs the belt.  And here's what he would do.  He would fold the belt up into two, you know, so you get that like nice loop.  Yeah.  And as he's hitting me, this reciting would happen with each whack.  Why did you run out in the street when you, and I'm like, oh, could you leave out some 
[02:51:30]  fucking adjectives and just get to the point?  Even more.  This is not four syllables in the.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The.  The.  Oh.  Oh.  W.  H.  Y.  D.  I.  D.  Y.  Oh.  You're fucking dead.  You're spelling now.  This is killing me.  You're killing me.  And it just was, it just got like fear and pain and you just didn't. 
[02:52:00]  Mistrust of your parents.  Yeah.  You don't think they love it.  It didn't help.  It's, it's pain before you can take that kind of pain.  It didn't help.  Yeah.  What kind of kid is supposed to take that kind of pain?  The ignorant shit I hate hearing is when people like, well, my child mouthed off to me and  I slapped them in the mouth and he never did it again.  Yeah.  Is that all that happened?  That he never did it again?  He never did it again and he's scarred.  It's like, it's not an odd, a kid isn't a product.  Like, hey, it worked.  That's all I care about is the result was the kid wasn't, wasn't nasty again. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  Well, you could have gotten that respect by the fucking kid liking you as a person or  just fucking giving them some positive.  I mean, there's a million ways.  When you yell at your kid, it destroys them.  I mean, you don't need to fucking hit them, you know?  Yeah.  I just don't think it works.  The hitting thing was really weird.  I thought you'd be a hitter.  No, never.  I thought you'd be a spanker.  And also, to me, it's like fucking perverted.  It is like an S&M thing.  You're going to spank your kid's bare bottom while they're screaming? 
[02:53:00]  Pull your pants down.  Fucking sicko.  If you're doing that and you don't have a boner, then I don't even understand what's going on.  Hey, Glenn from Connecticut, Opie said there were bad spankings.  Does that imply that there are good spankings from your father?  I think there...  I think you could go too far is what I'm saying.  I think there's the whack on the ass with the open hand, not a fucking send them flying across the room thing, but just an attention getter.  Like a, hey, no.  Right. 
[02:53:30]  I think if a parent does that, and me, not being a parent, I'm talking to my ass here.  I don't know.  But I just seem like that's a little less destructive than the fucking ritualistic strap beating, which, by the way, it's funny you mention it.  My parents, too, got divorced, and then my mother had to be the disciplinarian.  She tried it once, and she tried the strap thing, and we had bunk beds.  So I went, like, rolling into the lower bunk bed, and she tried getting in there, like, with the fucking sidearm pitch, because she couldn't go overhand, because the top bunk was in the way. 
[02:54:00]  The Louie Tiat.  Yeah.  Submarine pitch.  Nice.  I see the Red Sox hat.  I'm helping Louie today.  She went in with the side swing, the tip of the...  And she didn't know to double over the strap or anything.  The tip of the belt did a perfect fucking cat-o'-nine-tails snap right on the tip of my dick.  Oh, nightmare.  I was screaming like I had been shot in the abdomen, and my mother dropped the belt and just, oh, my gosh.  She's crying. 
[02:54:30]  She's grabbing ice.  She doesn't know...  Kissing it, making it better.  Yeah, well, that helped.  She's putting ice on it.  Sucking out the poison.  She wasn't hitting me with a cobra.  Fuck, I'll make two X's.  There's no snake, just in case.  I wasn't sure what I picked up.  Was it my belt or a snake?  She put ice on it.  She's crying and never fucking even...  Never hit me again.  That was it with the disciplining with hitting.  No, and again, I understand.  If you're bringing your kid up in a tough situation, and if a kid goes out and almost dies, you just want to fucking get it in their head. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah, a quick message.  I understand it.  So I don't look down on parents to do it.  I understand it.  But people that are arrogant about it, I'm like, it works.  It worked on me.  I'm fine.  No, you're not.  No, you're not.  You're an idiot like the rest of us.  Your eyes don't even focus.  No, and it's not working.  The world is a fucking mess.  It fucks things up.  It's like if your refrigerator's making noise.  I unplugged it.  The noise stopped.  Yeah, but now it don't work. 
[02:55:30]  Your food's rotten.  Well, it doesn't make that noise.  I hear a peep out of it all night.  Something stinks.  I got to jump in.  Tom in Tennessee.  The daughter enjoys to get spanked.  What's this about, Tom?  What's going on, boys?  Yeah, I can't even spank my daughter.  She's four years old.  I can't even spank her anymore because she would start to do shit just for me to spank her.  And she likes to get spanked.  Holy fuck.  Of course.  What a whore.  She wouldn't cry. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah, she wouldn't cry.  She would just look back at me and just give me the fucking eyes.  See, that's the territory you're getting into.  Holy shit.  It's fucked up.  Fucked up, yeah.  It is.  Wow, I've never fucking heard of that.  That is not right.  There's a guy in her future that's going to be real happy.  Oh, yeah.  No, but my daughter likes getting timeouts.  She likes, she has to sit in the corner with, like, face in the wall.  Yeah.  She'll do something and then go, do I need a timeout?  Do I need a timeout?  She gets off on it.  She likes it.  Wow, that's like some kind of discipline thing. 
[02:56:30]  Sure.  Maybe some time alone.  Do you watch any of those nanny shows?  No.  Nanny 911 or something?  I've never had enough fucking time.  Yeah, I realize.  The idea of watching somebody else having a problem with a kid.  Yeah.  Fuck it.  I'd rather.  Let me give you a little insight.  Yeah.  I'll give you a little insight on single guy with no kids.  Yeah.  You know, I got a girlfriend, but, you know, no kids.  Those shows fascinate me because it is a fucking madhouse at the beginning. 
[02:57:00]  Kids running, spitting at their parents, cursing, ripping hair out of the siblings' heads, and  then they're smacking them around.  And then this nanny comes in and makes a little timeout area, and it takes time.  She gets down on the level of the child, like, takes a knee, and explains to the child what  the problem is.  And then by the end of the show, there are these little angels that put their clothes  away.  Well, what you find out is that the parents aren't doing anything.  Right.  Most parents don't do anything. 
[02:57:30]  That's usually what it is.  They don't put any thought.  They just live with these kids like they're roommates.  Yep.  They let them watch television, which just makes your kid into a fucking idiot.  And puts the TV is a level of stimulus that nothing can compete with.  Louie, it's all I fucking did as a child.  I know.  Me too.  Me too.  Was sit in front of the TV.  Pump them full of fucking MSG and sugar, which all food is.  Same thing.  And give them television to watch, which sends them into this fucked up state in their minds.  And then they get, the kids don't have a regulatory system.  No.  They just, they get agitated. 
[02:58:00]  They do, they don't know how to stop themselves from doing something.  So these parents, like, let the fucking TV raise them.  Give them bad food without even thinking about it.  Don't give them any fruit or actually fucking any nutrition.  Yeah.  Then the kid goes, ah, and then they hit them.  I mean, it's, it's turning.  It's why the whole, and people are like, well, it works.  No, it doesn't.  The country's going to shit.  Yeah.  It's fucking crime and drug.  That's where drug addiction comes from.  Interracial relationships.  What's that?  Interracial relationships.  Interracial relationships, which is a huge problem.  Bring, yeah.  A girl gets hit enough times and doesn't want her. 
[02:58:30]  She's bringing one of them home.  That's right.  Dark, dark, dark, and a pink hat.  Oh, I'll show you in the end.  Every fucking beating the father ever gave.  Ever, ever, ever.  Hey, pops.  Want to introduce you to Tyrone.  Hit me now.  Holy fuck.  Hit me now.  Andy from Chicago.  Andy.  How's it going, fellas?  Hey, Andy.  I'm spreading out here, so keep it up.  Yeah, growing up, we lived on a little cul-de-sac, and not only did I get everything on my ass  from a wooden spoon, like the cake mixing spoons and ping-pong paddles and studded belts, 
[02:59:00]  but it was pretty much the norm.  If I was acting up and my folks weren't around, my neighbors could take care of it.  It pretty much got to the point where if the neighbor was having a bad day and I was acting  out of it in any way, they could pretty much take it out on me.  Oh, permission to hit you by a neighbor.  That's nice, too.  Not just hit, man.  One time, we had a little crick by my house, and the guy, the neighbor, had me over his  head.  Who's the Mark Twain character this guy is?  Had a crick.  I don't know.  What about the crick?  How did he discipline you, sir?  Did nigger Jim hit you?  With a radio? 
[02:59:30]  Hey, man.  He had me over his head.  He's like, I'm throwing you in.  I'm throwing you in.  I'm like, no, you're not.  You're a liar.  He drops me and kicks me with steel-toed boots in the ass.  We're calling him a liar at five years old.  And not only did I get a boot in the ass, but then he calls up and tells my mom that  I called him a liar, so I had to do that, wait for daddy to get home, to get married.  Oh, great.  You get hit.  That was another thing.  Yeah, wait until your father gets home.  And then now you've got to sit like fucking the Green Mile.  You're just waiting to get fucking bludgeoned. 
[03:00:00]  That's the worst part.  Yeah.  I remember when I was a kid once.  Psychological damage.  My mother gave me $5 to go to the market to buy some stuff for the family.  And I was walking around with my friends just playing and not go to the store.  And then I found, I'm walking down this.  Little Louie fucked up.  Yeah.  Here it comes.  Fucked up.  And I'm walking through this little alley behind the stores that we used to fuck around in  and I found $5.  And in my insides, I knew it was my $5 that I had dropped and then found.  But I didn't go in that pocket because I didn't want to believe it. 
[03:00:30]  I wanted to believe that I found $5.  And I bought ice cream and I bought the Guinness Book of World Records.  I remember it was a big deal to me that I bought that.  Of course.  I'm a nerd.  Yeah.  It was a big book when we were kids.  You were 17.  Yeah, I was 23.  And I went home and I told my mother, look at this stuff I got.  And she said, where's the food that you're supposed to buy?  Oh my God, I lost the $5.  How did you even think that would pan out for you?  So she sent me to my room and then when my father came home, she told him the story. 
[03:01:00]  I could hear them talking and they're laughing about the story.  Of course.  It's hysterical.  They just think it's hilarious.  So I'm like, I have to be off the hook.  But they laughed at my story and then he beat the shit out of me.  Which is the worst.  I mean, it's seared in my memory.  Of course.  I remember every moment of it.  It's right there now.  Yeah.  It's awful.  Let's go to the story here.  Should spanking under three be illegal?  Parents could soon find themselves in time out for spanking their kids.  A California Assemblywoman is proposing a ban on spanking children younger than three. 
[03:01:30]  If that bill passes, hitting your toddler would be a misdemeanor offense, landing you actually  behind bars or with a $1,000 fine.  MSNBC legal expert Susan Finland joins me.  Now, Susan, this is a fun one.  What?  What do trial abuse laws cover?  Abuse.  Abuse, neglect, beating, cruelty, endangerment, spanking.  But here's the problem with this legislation.  What's a spank?  Is it a tap?  Is it a love tap?  Is it a smack?  Is it a... 
[03:02:00]  And who decides that?  Exactly.  Exactly.  And now we're going to start telling parents how to really parent their children.  Why don't we now have a bill you didn't love your child enough?  You didn't nurture your child enough.  You know, you were overly critical of that art project.  It is a slippery slope.  As we're both parents, so we can both really feel this one deeply and personally.  I hate that slippery slope.  I do, too.  No, you make...  You have to...  Slippery...  Everything's a slippery slope.  Everything's a slippery...  Yes, exactly.  Even a fucking... 
[03:02:30]  Even a well-adhered slope is slippery.  Sure.  Yeah, you don't want to stand on that stable ground because it's a slippery slope.  Slope has been salted and still people are bitching about it.  Well, they ask, how could this even be enforced?  That's the question.  What judge is going to believe a two-year-old?  Experts say, and I think this is pretty true, spanking usually happens in the home.  Experts.  So how would this even be enforced from a legal standpoint?  Oh, my gosh.  Can you imagine now parents bickering?  I'm calling the cops on you for spanking the child.  I mean, it's just a really, really bad idea. 
[03:03:00]  It's an impossible bill to enforce.  It's going to be impossible to define.  It's going to be impossible to determine appropriate punishment.  Who gets a year?  Oh, that was a really bad spank.  You get six months because that wasn't the worst spank I've ever seen.  Right.  I mean, I just...  For me, it's like how this differs from...  I mean, child abuse is important to have laws in the book to protect things, leave a mark,  et cetera, et cetera.  There's an easy way to say abuse happened here, physical abuse happened, and you need  to be punished.  This is a slippery slope in a gray area in the law. 
[03:03:30]  That said, what do you think the chances are of this passing?  Zero?  I mean, I just think it's stupid.  Well, you're stupid.  Then why are you guys talking about it?  Exactly.  I don't think they should pass a law like that.  No law.  It's just fucking...  People shouldn't have common sense.  ...do it, but they shouldn't pass it.  And in California, it doesn't give a shit about kids.  No.  That's the meanest state in the world.  They care about themselves, right?  Yeah, no.  I mean, I did a benefit for this place that was a foster home for kids that were left 
[03:04:00]  in cars by the highway because they had terminal...  Kids that have terminal diseases in poor neighborhoods, they get fucking left just on the highway all  the time.  So this was a foster home for them.  And the state of California closed it because they didn't like the statistics...  The foster homes is where they get the statistics of how many kids are endangered, and the statistics  were getting too high in California.  Makes the state look bad.  So they just closed the...  Closed it down.  They want them to count them.  No way to count them.  And we look better.  No, it's awful.  Do you read the fucking Grapes of Wrath? 
[03:04:30]  It's an awful place.  No, it's a cruel state.  So they're hypocrites.  I think what we need to be aware of is if you see a kid in a grocery store whose parent  or caregiver is whacking them, you know, pants down with a hairbrush on a bare bottom...  Hold on a second.  Get that camera phone out.  Who the fuck has seen that?  YouTube.  Another fucking Bill Donahue type of...  Yeah, no kidding.  Oh.  What if a child is blowing Martin Luther King?  And being spanked for it.  He could be spanked for that, sure. 
[03:05:00]  ...store whose parent or caregiver is whacking them, you know, pants down with a hairbrush  on a bare bottom.  Ow!  You call the police.  I don't think anyone's going to call that a spank.  And I think that's what we're talking about.  I think we're talking about egregious discipline.  Discipline.  Abuse, right.  But a parent, a love tap, a little smack, a wake-up spank, whatever you want to call it.  Wake-up spank.  Wake-up spank.  I used to do that every morning.  I couldn't work during the day.  No.  Too tired.  So that is what they're targeting. 
[03:05:30]  Oh, interesting.  Anybody out there with a two-year-old?  Yeah, exactly.  So this is dumb.  Okay.  I mean, really.  She's soliciting children now?  And we need real police enforcement.  Anybody under three will be really funny.  Aren't we all talking about Sean Hornback?  You just planted your fist into his stomach.  Let's put our resources toward that.  Sexual predators.  People who molest children.  What?  That's where we should be putting our resources.  Ah.  Spanking.  Oh, please.  Spanking molesters?  What?  But again, it's like these people that are like, you know, should we be watering our lawns  in the summer?  I don't know. 
[03:06:00]  But what about people blowing children in Martin Luther King?  I was talking about something completely different.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Exactly.  We got another great story.  Lee in Indiana.  Lee, it's your turn on the O'Brien Anthony Show.  What's up, Lee?  How are you guys doing this morning?  All right.  Yeah, when I was a kid, my stepmom used to use what they call bed slats.  And the one-by-twos they used to put underneath the mattress.  Yeah.  Oh, those things.  Bed slats.  Shit.  That's fucking like in the hole beating.  That's like fucking when you're in the hole in jail. 
[03:06:30]  In prison.  Oh, it was the worst.  And she beat me one time so bad, she almost broke my arm.  So I called the cops.  And the cops come out there and showed her a special hole to put on my neck to make me  pass out.  And they said, if he ever gives you that kind of problem again, just squeeze his neck  right here.  He'll go down like a brick, you know, like a bag of bricks.  Who are you, Radio Rahim?  Indiana.  I got it.  Wow.  Hey, I was up in Chicago seeing you guys' billboard up there yesterday. 
[03:07:00]  And I don't know what they did to your face, Anthony, but it looks like you're just one  false sword of a rubber helmet, man.  I mean, they got that thing so distorted up there.  No wonder nobody listens up there in Chicago.  They distorted your face on the...  Oh, no, it's just the way I really look.  You know he could have been a model, right?  He could have been a model.  You know what else is really bad when you're a kid?  I used to get hit with different objects if something wasn't readily available.  Yeah.  And one thing was when they hit you with your fucking toys that you're like, then that 
[03:07:30]  toy all of a sudden is not fun for you anymore.  You would lose that toy immediately.  I got beat with a Hot Wheels track.  Fucking Hot Wheels track are custom made for beating children with.  And I got a smack on the ass with it.  And then you're playing with your Hot Wheels and just getting anxiety and not knowing why.  Kids also, you're teaching them to use it against each other.  Like if you have siblings, the parent who hits becomes like this justice system that you learn  how to subvert and use against you. 
[03:08:00]  Now I will use this.  Yeah.  Like there was a little kid across the street from me when I was growing up named Benji  and I didn't really like him, but I got threw in with him because we're the same age.  So our parents, oh, go play with Benji.  Yeah.  So I was over there and he was just, I started poking him with a stick, just being an asshole  to him.  And he's going, stop it.  And I just kept poking him.  And then he hit me and his father saw it throughout the window.  And his father came running out and beat the shit.  I just spanked the living shit out of him.  Wow.  And I was thrilled at that cause and effect. 
[03:08:30]  Just watching that.  Yeah.  The next day I went over and I started poking him and he's trying to resist because he doesn't  want to get hit.  And I just kept bothering him.  And then he hit me and the father came out and beat him up again.  And I was like, this is awesome.  This is so good.  That's what I was taught by spanking.  See?  And he was taught and it was unfair to him.  Oh.  Now Benji's in a bathhouse right now probably voluntarily being tied up and fucked in the mouth.  Thanks to you and your stick. 
[03:09:00]  Hey, Mr. Torrance from Instant Feedback.  My father went to the WWF School of Parenting.  He would just grab random objects nearby to beat me with.  He once broke a shelf over my head.  And I remember thinking, I built that in shop class, you asshole.  The things that go through your head.  I was blaming things on animals and stuff.  I used to take things apart.  I would love just disassembling stuff.  But I was a kid, so I never knew how to put it back together.  You could just take things apart.  And my parents had a nice clock. 
[03:09:30]  And I just wanted to know how it worked.  So you never think you're going to take the whole goddamn thing apart.  Of course you took it apart.  You just want to kind of look at the insides.  And then something goes boing.  Yeah.  And it's just gone.  And it was apart.  So I laid it out on the floor.  And I took the dog.  We had a dog.  And I took his paws.  Put him up on the table that the clock was on.  And scraped with his nails into the table.  Like I'm setting up the perfect crime here. 
[03:10:00]  And left it like that.  And it would have been better if I said I did it.  Because I had to watch my father beat the shit out of our dog.  This poor animal is going,  And I'm like,  Oh my God.  I just fucking condemned that dog.  That innocent dog for this beating that he's getting.  No, but that's the thing.  That's what beating your kids.  Because a kid can't face a beating.  Right.  It's too awful for a kid.  That's what I was doing.  I couldn't take the beating.  So that's what you turn kids into liars. 
[03:10:30]  And I am a liar my whole life.  I'm a dishonest person.  Because I couldn't face negativity.  I couldn't face making a mistake.  This is like therapy.  Yeah.  I'm getting a therapy session.  But that's what,  If you hit your kid,  People,  He never did that again.  Yeah, he did.  He just got good at hiding it.  Yeah.  You fucking faggot.  You know what would be really funny?  He's actually with the clock.  If your dad fucked the dog in front of you.  That was the punishment for the dog.  And it died.  He fucked it to death.  How do you know that isn't just the part I left out, Jimmy? 
[03:11:00]  We got another great song.  Dad, fuck that dog.  We got another real good one coming in here.  Justin from Oklahoma.  Justin.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Justin.  Hey, listen.  Whenever,  I used to go stay with my dad in the summertime,  So I hated going because my stepmom used to beat the shit out of me.  But I always had a hard time going to sleep because I was always homesick from my mom.  And he would tell me that the little black boys would come around  and come in my room and wake me up if I did not go to sleep at the time I was supposed to go to sleep. 
[03:11:30]  Oh, my God.  How much pressure is that?  Yeah, I remember that one, too.  Did it ever happen?  What's funny now is my girlfriend is black.  That's cool.  And your favorite movie is Ghost.  My favorite movie is Ghost.  Did that ever happen?  Did any black boys come in your room and...  Now that I knew, I fucking went to sleep.  Sure.  We, me and my brother, you know, used to talk.  We had bunk beds.  We shared a room.  So we would talk.  And we lived in a real small shithole apartment where our bedroom was right off the living room. 
[03:12:00]  So my father and mother would just be miserable on opposite sides of the couch watching, like, Ronan Martin's laughing.  Trying to get a laugh in their lives.  And my mother looking snidely over my father every time he'd laugh because it implied he was enjoying himself.  And that just pissed my mother off that he was having fun.  Just the hatred between the two of them.  Oh, totally.  And me and my brother would sit there and just, like, we would be on bunk beds in the bedroom.  But they could hear us and we'd be just whispering to each other. 
[03:12:30]  Anything, like, did you see the commercial for the new Hot Wheels and stuff?  It's so cool.  We didn't want to get inside.  And we'd hear from inside, hey, knock it off in there and get to sleep.  If you're not to sleep in 15 minutes, I'll come in there.  And then you're sitting there going, oh, my God, my body has to fall asleep.  Or he's going to know I'm not asleep.  How much pressure is that on a kid to sleep?  I know.  And then we couldn't talk.  Even lower.  We're just trying – we want kids trying to enjoy each other's company.  And he would come over and hang the belt on the doorknob. 
[03:13:00]  Oh, Jesus.  And it would, like, swing.  That's going to help me sleep.  The light would glisten off the buckle.  Like, I remember this vividly.  Like, that belt would be the warning.  That's going to make you sleep.  And you'd stare at the belt and be, I've got eight minutes left.  Holy shit.  He's going to know I can't fake it.  I can't shut my – I'm not a fucking actor.  I can't shut my eyes and make believe I'm asleep.  He can tell.  I'm not asleep.  It was just frightening.  What would have happened if, like, after you went back to the living room, if you opened the door and took the belt and threw it back down the hall and go, you forgot your belt, stupid. 
[03:13:30]  That would have been awesome.  Oh, and I would have loved to have been able to do something like that.  Clank it on the floor after you threw it.  He wouldn't be here today, man.  And, you know, let me tell you something.  I don't know what effect this had, but when they would go out or leave the house and a babysitter would come over or something like that, me and my brother would break into the fucking liquor cabinet and start drinking.  At what age?  We were drinking.  What age?  I had to be fucking eight. 
[03:14:00]  Holy shit.  Maybe my brother was nine.  And my brother would start fucking making out with the babysitters.  Right.  They were, like, 15 years old, 16 years old babysitters.  That's what happens.  Yeah.  Because when my parents.  You just lose fucking control.  I'll say, fuck you.  I'm doing it.  When my parents went, Mike, because my dad left the house and then my mother would work.  And I used to go home.  I used to leave school in the middle of the day all the time.  Just leave.  And I'd go home.  I'm just leaving.  Yeah.  I'd just buy. 
[03:14:30]  And I was like a feral cat in the house.  Rubbing my dick against every surface in the house.  Fucking, you know, just disgusting.  I used to climb.  We had an upstairs neighbors because we live in a two family house.  And I threw the basement, go into their apartment and steal shit.  I became a fucking mess.  It really worked.  It worked well, that spanking thing, I guess.  Yeah.  Wow.  I've always kind of been an advocate, too, of the spanking.  But now that I look back, it might not have worked.  Because Louie brought up a great point where it's like, hey, it worked. 
[03:15:00]  But you just don't know what else it's doing.  That's a huge problem.  It's so.  You're also teaching your kid that hitting is how you get stuff.  I mean, that's how, you know, that you listen to people who hit you.  What kind of fucking life lesson is that?  Well, if someone hits you, just listen to him.  Just do whatever they said right before you.  Yeah.  It's bad in raising a kid.  Although I do think on, like, places where it should be yanked at, or, like, if a kid's  crying on a plane.  Like, if he's not used to being hit, and all of a sudden you're hammer fisting him.  Now, I think an attention-getting whack on the ass is kind of an attention-getter thing. 
[03:15:30]  I mean, I wouldn't do it again.  I mean, I can't imagine.  Fucking, the kids are so tiny.  It's just bizarre to me.  Pick them up by the arm.  But look, I don't believe in hitting my dog.  I don't believe in it.  But my dog once snapped at my daughter, and I fucking laid her out.  And I felt bad.  And I don't think it was right.  Did you get a good, ah, out of it?  It was pretty good.  Oh, that's, they get surprised when you hit them.  I smacked her in the face.  Hard?  Yeah.  I threw her outside.  I dragged her outside. 
[03:16:00]  And as I closed the door on her, I gave her a fucking nasty whack in the face.  You think the dog knew why?  It was for snapping?  I didn't matter.  Didn't even care.  It was retribution.  It wasn't fucking rehabilitation.  It was just he fucking snapped.  Dog behaved after that, though, right?  Well, yeah.  But with the dog, especially, actually hitting dogs is a plain bad idea.  Because they do get aggressive.  They get snapped.  It confuses them.  Yeah, they don't.  Because they don't hit each other.  Dog.  Yeah.  Why don't we go to Jason in Wyoming?  Well, they do lick each other's assholes.  It doesn't mean we just have to interact like they should. 
[03:16:30]  No.  We should.  Perhaps.  If he doesn't bite the dog.  When my dog was a puppy, I did bite her on the ear, which I heard is a good, like,  I laid down flat on top of her and bit her on the ear.  Did the alpha male thing?  And it worked.  She sat, pissed on it.  Just pissed in her face.  Piss in its favorite corner.  Showing who's boss.  Hey, this has come in a couple times as well.  Jason in Wyoming, here's another angle.  Jason, go ahead.  Yeah, you guys got me reminiscing about the, God damn it, if I got to come in there.  Yeah.  But my dad used to give me a tune-up. 
[03:17:00]  If I was being good for an extended period of time, he'd whack me in the back of the head  to remind me of what would happen if I was naughty.  Wow.  This came in a few times, people that, they were too good for too long and the father  felt like they got to hit him anyway.  That's a good one.  Well, yeah, you got to get a tune-up.  Just to keep him going, I guess.  No, and at all, I think you tapped into something when you said that your father is laughing at  laughing.  Yeah.  And his wife is sneering at him.  That's why he's yelling at you.  They were, of course.  Yeah.  They were miserable. 
[03:17:30]  No, there's nothing, that is the trait of a miserable marriage.  And I've been there that your wife does not want you to be, which is, again, why I stay  at the Ritz on the road.  Because if my wife calls me at work, I'm working on a comedy show.  Right.  And everybody's in my office and we're laughing about something.  And she calls on my phone and she's, oh, what, do you just sit around and laugh all  day?  Yeah.  Is that what you're doing while I'm home with the kids?  You're sitting there and laughing?  She's angry.  So when people call me on my phone at work when I'm on a show, I have to go, shh, like 
[03:18:00]  it's, I'm smoking pot and my mom's calling.  No fun in the air.  Yeah, yeah, no.  No fun.  Everybody get out.  Hi.  No, we're just working really hard on the comedy.  It's just miserable.  It's very hard.  I was married for nine years.  And Opie remembers.  I would love doing the show.  And then we used to carpool because we lived in the same town.  So he'd be driving me home.  And, like, he could see the point where he'd make a corner. 
[03:18:30]  And, like, the fun and vibrant life I had would be sucked from my body.  My shoulders went down.  Like, we're talking, yeah, we'd be talking about that day's show and what we're going  to do tomorrow and just our career and how excited we are about being in New York.  And then we'd turn a corner and my shoulders would slump.  My jaw would kind of go down.  My eyes would kind of get, like, down.  And she'd be at the door kind of looking out the door.  And, like, I'd be walking toward the door and Opie would hear some shit like, like, 
[03:19:00]  the garbage was supposed to be at the curb this morning.  Oh, my God.  And he'd drive away just, and I'm a beaten man.  Well, the vacuum cleaner is the story we always tell.  Oh, yeah.  When he comes to pick me up.  Anthony's not a morning person.  And I used to pick him up around 10, 10.30, whatever.  But the point of the story, Ant was awake maybe five minutes because he would wake,  get in the car, and try to wake up, you know, for the ride.  All psyched to come in because it's a fucking fun job.  Sure.  So I pulled up one day, and there's, like, this huge argument going on on the stoop. 
[03:19:30]  And I'm thinking to myself, I know he gets up just in time to jump in the car.  What could he have possibly done wrong?  He's been awake maybe two minutes.  And she was yelling and screaming because he didn't vacuum before he left the house.  Because vacuuming was my responsibility.  To do our shock jock radio show.  Vacuuming was my responsibility.  And another thing, as you brought it up, there were a couple times I was ready to drop him  back off at the house, and I would actually go, you want to go around the block?  What do you want to do? 
[03:20:00]  You don't want to go home.  So I would, like, I would drive past the house just so he could get, I don't know, psyched  or just get himself together.  No, my wife, we had one of those ridiculous garbage arguments because she came in the kitchen  and said, how come the garbage isn't out in the bin?  It's sitting on the kitchen floor.  And I go, the bin is full.  And she goes, really?  It's full?  And I'm like, I have to breathe to not get my, oh, no.  Yeah, yeah.  It's full.  And she goes, so even a bag wouldn't fit in there?  And I'm like, why don't you go outside and look? 
[03:20:30]  Why don't you go look in the bin?  And I'm saying it with, like, a tight smile.  Why don't you go look in the bin?  And she's like, why are you being shitty?  I'm only asking you if it's full.  No, you're not just asking.  You're asking three times regardless of my answer.  Yeah, it doesn't matter.  I've answered you.  Yeah.  You asked again and again.  Yeah.  And then so I start talking like that.  Like, I'm going, you asked again and again.  And I told you it was.  And then she goes, look at you.  Look at yourself. 
[03:21:00]  Look how you're talking.  Women are awful.  She's like Perry Mason.  Like, trying to trip you up on your testimony.  And then finally you lost.  You were the guy that went, all right.  All right.  And see the temper, ladies and gentlemen of the jury.  See, ladies and gentlemen of the jury.  Yeah, but here's how fucked up things are.  The bin was not full.  And I'm mad at her because how would she know I'm lying?  Like, I'm mad at her.  Right.  I'm mad.  I'm indignant that she's calling me a liar simply because I know she has no reason to doubt me.  She would have had to have looked.  But it was not full. 
[03:21:30]  Did she check the bin?  What's that?  She would have had to have looked into the bin.  She doesn't do anything.  No, she didn't.  She didn't look.  She did not look.  Then how did she know it wasn't full?  No, she just doesn't trust me.  Just because she knew you're a liar.  See, I'm angry that she doesn't trust me even though the fact is I'm lying.  You shouldn't be trusted.  It's true.  Hey, let's get.  I love it.  Let's get a hot story on the air here.  It's Michelle in Jersey.  Michelle, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I just wanted to relate to Anthony.  My dad used to do the same thing.  Like, me and my sister would share a room.  And late at night, he would turn the TV down so he could hear us talk. 
[03:22:00]  A bunch of little girls would tear shatter.  So he would come with a belt and beat us.  And then he would like to say some things.  Like, he'd beat us in syllables or what have you.  Yeah.  And we would have to laugh at him for what he tripped up on.  And then he would hit us some more for that.  It was ridiculous.  It was relentless.  You laughed?  Yeah, he would laugh.  Like, we had to laugh because he was tripping up.  Like, he was saying stuff that didn't make any sense.  Because, I don't know why.  Oh, because he was just doing it in syllables and got all mixed up. 
[03:22:30]  Yeah, that syllable beating is the worst for a kid.  You're just like, oh, my God, where's he going with this story?  How long is it going to go?  Like, when does this wrap up?  Jesus.  Oh.  And it was teaching, you know, teaching us a lesson.  Meanwhile, it was because he was miserable.  They're all talking about the Dakota Fed.  Oh, now they got a little clips of the movie.  Oh, boy.  Well, look how cute she is.  Some critics are saying it wasn't graphic enough. 
[03:23:00]  Pedophiles are coming out saying.  DA says film crew did not commit a crime.  Look at this guy.  Oh, he looks like.  Investigate him.  It's a clean-shaven Bill.  He's a talk show host?  I think he's from Air America.  Ben Ferguson.  Or Radio America.  Is that different than Air America?  Yeah.  I think that's.  Damn, be old.  Oh, my God.  He looks like the conservative.  Ben Ferguson tells me this guy was first online with a handful of tickets.  Yeah.  No kidding.  These people are causing the problem because it's a movie about where there's a child rape, 
[03:23:30]  like we were saying, in the context of a story.  Right.  It's probably dealt with very, you know, tastefully and artistically.  It's supposed to be horrid.  But these people are removing it and just showing her picture and saying raped on camera.  Rape.  And just turning it into.  This big thing.  They're distilling it down to an ugly thing.  And so that kids are going to see.  Kids aren't going to see that movie.  No.  Because it's a piece of shit Sundance art fuck film.  Right.  Artsy-fartsy movie.  But they are watching CNN over their parents' shoulders seeing a little girl's face and it says rape.  And they show her when she's like eight. 
[03:24:00]  Not that 12 is anything like that.  But at 12 or 13 years old that she is now is a lot different than the pictures they're showing her smiling with her missing teeth.  Yeah.  Rape.  Yeah.  It's a movie.  She's a fucking actress.  Let's go to John in North Carolina.  John.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I got a price this one.  And this is, I swear to God, this is true.  And before my father died, he admitted to my wife so I had a witness that he did this.  When I was a kid, he was too lazy to get up off the couch and spank me. 
[03:24:30]  So one day, he was a World War II buff.  So one day he pulled off this book from the bookshelf and he said, come here, boy, I want to show you something.  And he opens it up and he shows me Auschwitz and all the bodies and all the ovens and all this stuff and explained to me what it was.  And then he showed me all these kids and they experimented on.  And then he puts it to the stage and he says, this guy here, his name is Heinrich Himmler.  And he was the head Nazi that was in charge of all this.  And he lives at, you know, that German restaurant on the main road we go to eat?  I said, yes. 
[03:25:00]  He lives in that basement.  He said, and I got his number.  And any time you're bad, all I got to do is call him and he will take you away and put you there.  Wow.  Your father threatened to send you to the Nazis?  So that's what happened to Himmler.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  He ended up in a restaurant?  And how many?  But the killer part, I'm sorry to interrupt, but the killer part is, then they would take us to eat at this restaurant and wonder why they had us.  Great schnitzel.  What are you going to do?  I don't care if Heinrich Himmler is in the fucking basement.  The fucking pigs feed are awesome.  We had Mengele's soup recipes. 
[03:25:30]  John, what would you wonder when you were in the restaurant?  I was freaking because I just knew he was.  And my father would nudge me and go, hey, boy, he's in the basement.  You best be good.  And I would just freak the hell out.  John, how many hookers have you strangled?  Wow.  I quit doing that a couple of years ago when I got married.  There you go.  I'm okay now.  Thanks, John, for the story.  Let's go to Tom in New York.  Tom?  Morning.  Hey.  Yeah, my stepfather and his brother came from Europe in the 60s, and they had this real strict disciplinarian streak. 
[03:26:00]  And we were over at their house one time visiting my cousins.  The youngest boy did something bad.  All four kids had to drop their drawers and bend over the bathtub and get smacked with the belt like Anthony's father.  And I'm 12 years old watching a 15, a 14, and a 13-year-old girl bent over the bathtub getting her ass back.  Wow.  That's completely hot.  It costs a lot of money now.  Yep.  You can see that.  And you've got to fly all the way to Thailand. 
[03:26:30]  Wow.  And sit next to John.  Or is it, Jeff?  We don't know.  Either one.  All right.  This is getting depressing.  The voices are changing on the phones.  Yeah, everybody's kind of like...  Yeah, people are thinking about it too much.  I remember it was 1973, and it was an early morning.  There was a mist in the backyard.  Everyone's got these vivid memories now.  We're supposed to be having fun here for these people.  It's like the way people describe 9-11.  Yeah.  It was a cold, crisp morning. 
[03:27:00]  I don't remember where I was.  September.  The sun was shining.  The sky was so blue.  It was unusually sunny.  It was the last thing you expected.  Such a horrific day.  Oh, Jesus.  What's that smell?  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  On SiriusXM.  Let's go to Jennifer in Cleveland.  Jennifer.  Hey, how are you guys doing?  I hear LeBron James says he could play in the NFL.  He could, actually.  You know, he was recruited by Ohio State.  Was he really?  Yeah, he really was.  I know one of his fellow high school guys there was a really good football player. 
[03:27:30]  Oh, at SDSM?  I don't know where.  Did his school have anything to do with an orange color?  Ooh, very good.  I want to know.  Oh, yeah.  I just want to not go to the Browns, okay?  Yeah, the Browns are what?  What are they right now?  Oh, they're 1-8.  They are 1-8, right?  Wow.  They are 1-8.  You're a sports chick, huh?  See, but here's the difference.  I'm a big sports chick.  Here's the difference.  At least you know your fucking football team sucks this year. 
[03:28:00]  See, we had all this hope in New York for Sanchez and the Jets going, wow, we got a pretty  good shot at making the playoffs.  Next thing you know, we're suffering here, and now the season's a bust, and you got the  fucking coach.  He's 340 pounds.  He's blubbering and crying like an idiot to his players.  Slubbering.  There's a whole article in it where he's in the Hall of Fame of crying with Mike Schmidt  and the rest of them now.  Wow.  Unfortunately, there's no tape of him crying, though.  That is true.  With two bad knees.  I love that one. 
[03:28:30]  Hey, Jennifer, hold on to the line.  We got a player.  We got a player, Mike Schmidt.  Mike Schmidt crying never gets old.  Hold on a minute.  No problem.  You're doing radio with us.  Enjoy.  Okay, I am.  Travis, you got that?  See, now.  A few years ago, I left Dayton, Ohio with two very bad knees and a dream to become a Major  League Baseball player.  I know.  My favorite part. 
[03:29:00]  I thank God the dream came true.  Okay, fuck it.  What's next?  What a girly cry that is.  True.  Came true.  Beauty who.  It was just about baseball, man.  When my dad died, I didn't cry like that.  I had a good cry, but I didn't sound like that.  No, you go.  Oh, daddy. 
[03:29:30]  Oh, God.  Daddy.  Oh, my God.  But we're about to get it back on radio, daddy.  Oh, no.  You supported me for those two years, and now you die a week before we're supposed to be  back on radio, daddy.  I think you feel ridiculous at what you sound like, so you just stop crying, hold it in.  That fucking sucks, that death shit.  I want my dad so bad. 
[03:30:00]  I'll admit it.  I didn't cry right off the bat when my dad died.  It was one of those things like I couldn't because there were too many people around.  You cried, though, huh?  I couldn't have fucking Anthony Cumia cried?  Of course.  It's my dad.  Nice.  Same thing.  When did you cry?  So, well, here's what it is.  Hold on, Jennifer.  We'll get to you.  Oh, no problem.  We like your laugh track, though.  It's really getting us pumped.  He dies.  Joe, I'm at the bar because I'm with, you know, the ex-wife, and she's working.  This is when we first met.  At the bar.  Yeah, yeah.  She's working at the bar. 
[03:30:30]  So, I'm sitting at the bar after work, downing a few beers.  My brother comes in.  He's like, oh, I got bad news, blah, blah, blah.  That's how you found out?  Yeah.  Joe came in, told me.  Oh, shit.  Where?  So, at the bar.  Broadway?  Yeah, off Broadway in Greenlawn.  So, I'm sitting at the bar now going like, oh, wow, that fucking sucks.  So, I'm drinking beer and stuff, and my brother has a beer, you know, just kind of like,  wow, I'm fucking shell-shocked and shit like that.  So, then, I wait till, you know, the ex gets off of work because I got to drive her home,  and I don't want to be in front of her because I didn't want any fucking comforting from her. 
[03:31:00]  So, we go home and go to sleep.  Right.  Now, we go to sleep, and then I had to get up and go to work the next day.  So, I get up and go to work, and I couldn't, like, cry anywhere there and stuff.  I had to wait till I came home the next day, got home, went upstairs, and, like, shut the door to my bedroom.  It was like, booty-hoo-dee-hoo, booty-hoo-dee-hoo-dee-hoo.  Wait, was the wife home? 
[03:31:30]  What?  Was she home?  No, the house was empty.  Oh, okay.  I missed that part.  Yeah, I just didn't want anybody walking in.  No, comforting my ass.  Yeah, exactly.  So, it was like, ooh-hoo-dee-hoo.  Did you have a good cry, though?  Not a good one because, like, for a little while, like, it was pretty intense for 10 seconds.  And then, I was just like, I couldn't help thinking how silly I sound.  Yeah.  So, I'm just like, all right.  I go, I got to stop this.  I think I got it all out.  It was like 10 seconds. 
[03:32:00]  That's it.  It was pretty intense.  And then, I just heard myself going, like, boo-hoo.  And I was like, stop that.  You sound silly.  Dude, man.  Believe it or not, man is, you know, is made to cry.  But as a man, you're not supposed to cry.  I mean, in recent years, I guess it's a little more accepted, a little more, but.  I don't know.  Dane Cook does a pretty good bit on, like, having a good cry.  And he is 100% right.  When you get a good cry going, man, it feels fucking great. 
[03:32:30]  It might.  You know why?  Because I think it exhausts you afterwards.  And you just could take a nap.  Yeah.  I remember the one time, though, I saw my father cry.  And it was just awful.  That is the worst.  You don't want to see that.  He drove up in his Le Mans.  Actually, he wasn't even in it because it had burnt up.  So the hood, he opened the hood on the highway and tried to get the fire out and burnt his hands.  So he came back to the house.  And my mother's like, you know, all right, Joey, come here. 
[03:33:00]  And his hands are under the water.  And now, I don't realize, but at the time, he's younger than I am now.  Like, way fucking younger.  Sure.  And I'm a little kid.  And I just hear, like, ooh, ooh.  So I go downstairs to see what's the matter.  And there I'm watching my fucking dad, who is, you know, supposed to be at that age, the do-all, be-all, end-all of men.  And he's crying.  And I went, Daddy, are you okay?  And he turned around and goes, get the fuck out of here.  He yelled, get the fuck out of here. 
[03:33:30]  Because he didn't want me seeing him cry.  Yeah, because that's not cool.  So, of course, I was like, yeah.  I start crying.  I run upstairs.  I have a tummy ache.  I'm a fucking baby.  That's great.  Get the fuck out of here.  Thanks, Dad.  A little sympathy I'm trying to give you.  And you tell me, get the fuck out.  My dad, I remember crying twice.  There's a good one and there's a bad one.  Oh, no.  The good one was The Passion of the Christ.  Near the end of his life, by the way.  He wanted to see this movie. 
[03:34:00]  He was like, my dad was very spiritual.  He believed in some good shit.  You got to get high to really get into some of the stuff my dad believed in.  He believed in some shit.  There was some wacky stuff.  Oh, he believed in some good stuff.  Angels and aliens and all sorts of stuff.  He hated organized religion, but he was a religious guy.  Yeah.  He believed in near-death experience, all that shit.  Very spiritual.  So, he wanted to see The Passion of the Christ, and I sat down there in Huntington, that theater  in Huntington, and he fucking bawled. 
[03:34:30]  Holy shit.  In the theater?  Bawled.  The whole theater.  Were you just looking around going like, holy fuck?  No, the whole theater was bawling because it was like an afternoon showing, so it was  a lot of older people in there.  And the whole, like, the Virgin Mary having to watch Jesus getting beat.  You should have just yelled out, Jesus Christ!  I wanted to stand up so bad and go, we get it.  He got beat bad.  Yeah.  Not quite as esoteric as the, would have you believe in other movies. 
[03:35:00]  And then the other one was, he was in a hospital bed.  You might want to turn off the radio.  Oh, no.  He was in a hospital bed.  No.  And he, oh, my God, he was in there for his, like, 20th heart operation.  I lost track.  And the night before, the big heart operations with my dad were always intense because he  didn't know if he was going to make it through.  And all of a sudden, he just started, I'm the last guy there.  It's, like, it's kind of dark.  How did you get last ups?  I was, because he had to come to the city, to one of the VA hospitals, I think. 
[03:35:30]  So it was tough for people to visit, but I was living in the city, so I went down there  and it was just me and him, and it's just a cold winter night, and everyone else is  gone, and pretty much the staff is gone.  There's only one night nurse, and all of a sudden, he's just crying in his bed as he's  hooked up to all this stuff.  Oh, no.  He goes, what's, I go, what's wrong, Dad?  He goes, I just love you guys so much.  Whoa, fuck.  How do you handle that, though?  You go, goodbye.  That's sort of what I was saying. 
[03:36:00]  And just run away.  I'm like, Dad, it's going to be okay.  It's going to be okay.  Run away from the situation.  Yeah, I try to get out.  I'm not even going to front.  I try to get out as quick as possible, because he was a tough guy.  He was one of these guys, like, ah, if I die tomorrow, you know, and one of those guys,  ah, I'm ready if I die tomorrow.  But then when the real mortality was sinking in, where, like, you know, it was a possibility  you could die, yeah, fuck, you realize, no, you're not ready for that shit.  You're not ready for that shit.  Oh, I think I had one more episode, but it wasn't that bad of seeing my dad get emotional. 
[03:36:30]  Oh, by the way, the phones were lit.  Twilight sucks.  Okay, we can move on from that fucking subject.  Uh, with this, um, oh, my parents, of course, having a giant argument.  I guess I was seven years old, and again, crying and all that happy horse shit.  And it was a big one.  I mean, they're yelling, screaming, and, uh, and all us kids are just like, ah, crying.  It was just a big crying, fucking yelling house.  God, the apartment above us must have hated us.  And, uh, and, like, my mother came out of the bedroom, because they were arguing in the 
[03:37:00]  bedroom, and then we're all crying, and she grabs the three of us, you know?  Yeah.  And she's like, oh, everyone's crying and stuff.  So I, like, pushed away and ran into the room where my father was, because I just thought,  that's awful.  Like, he's in there, all upset and alone, and what, the three kids and my mom are out  here, you know?  Right.  So I run into the room to, you know, be with a dear old dad.  And, uh, he, he was all, like, misty-eyed. 
[03:37:30]  Oh, shit.  And then he goes, he goes, I just gotta tell you, you're, you, you're my, you're my favorite.  I was different.  Oh, no.  You're my favorite.  We were, we were both, we were both favorites.  I was the favorite.  Know what that meant?  Paying the mortgage for 10 years.  Thanks.  Ah!  So glad I was your favorite.  Favoritist.  Holy shit.  How about, how about I'm second favorite?  And then I felt.  And you get the money from one of the other brothers.  Then I felt guilty that I was the favorite.  So I felt all guilty.  And, uh, see, that didn't work out. 
[03:38:00]  Parents gotta just shut their fucking mouths.  Shut your mouths with the kids!  Yeah, don't pick favorites.  Just be like, get me a beer.  Yeah, don't pick favorites.  Things like that.  Puts a lot of pressure on the little fella.  Help me fix the car.  That was, like, a big thing.  Like, uh, my dad was like, hey, Ann, Anthony, uh, help me fix the car.  No, and I couldn't do shit.  I couldn't do Ed Jack shit.  So I was standing up on the bumper and kind of holding on to the grill, looking in.  And he's like, oh, yeah, I think it's something with the carburetor and stuff.  I go, what's that screw and stuff?  He goes, oh, yeah, let me try that screw. 
[03:38:30]  He knew.  And it was like, oh, that's cool.  I helped dad fix the car.  That's like a fucking Norman Rockwell painting.  It was fantastic.  You had a normal childhood.  I didn't need, oh, you're my favorite.  What?  Now I feel bad.  Matt in Connecticut has something.  Uh, Matt, go ahead.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Um, I got it.  I don't know what it is, but this girl is just a total con.  Who laughs at dad dying stories?  What the fuck is wrong with that?  God damn dad dying stories.  Yeah, I was trying to go for a little shock there.  There's Jennifer just laughing and laughing. 
[03:39:00]  Comes with a name.  I'm sorry.  It's all right, Jennifer.  You got a good sense of humor.  I guess.  All right, we'll see you next time, Jennifer.  Thank you.  Hey, wait a minute.  I have one question.  Yeah.  What?  Listen, my brother's in Botswana in the Peace Corps.  Yeah.  He's coming back in May.  Can we come see your show?  No.  Not allowed.  Goodbye.  Peace Corps, you goddamn hippie.  Tommy.  What do you got in?  Well, I guess when I was conveying the story of me running into the room to be with dad 
[03:39:30]  while the other, you know, my brother and sister was with my mom, my sister texts,  um, awe.  Oh, really?  And then I guess after the, I'm, you're my favorite part, she goes, okay, I take that  all back.  Oops.  Let's say hi to Chris in Houston.  Chris Houston.  Hey.  Hey, fellas.  Hey.  Come on.  Hey, uh, when I was about 14, I went and saw Forrest Gump with my dad and, uh, he started 
[03:40:00]  crying so hard whenever Ginny died that this young couple on a date next to us had to get  up and move over.  They were embarrassed.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, it's like terrible.  He was on a date and it was just, yeah, I still remember the lip on his face.  It was just humiliating.  I don't know what, what cord it touched to my dad, but he was just bawling like a fucking  baby.  That's great.  Wow.  Maybe he had AIDS.  I'll fucking tell you something right now.  I fucking was, I was crying two days ago.  What?  I was fucking watching Private Ryan.  Oh. 
[03:40:30]  Holy mo- I can't fucking not cry.  Dude, the end of that movie.  Is brutal.  When the old man.  Well, Tom Hanks is.  Turns out to be Private Ryan.  Well, what got me going, yeah, I understand all that, but what got me going was Tom Hanks  basically saying, what's the famous line, earn it or something like that?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, as Tom Hanks is dying because he did everything to save this kid's life, even though it was  kind of stupid because you save one soldier and 28 guys die or whatever it was.  Yeah, exactly.  But whatever.  But he said, you know, make it a good life. 
[03:41:00]  Make it a good life.  Make it worth it or something like that.  I'm like, fuck, here come the tears.  And then the old soldier, now he's old.  He's standing in front of the grave of Tom Hanks' character.  And he's like, he asks his wife, you know, where's I, you're a good man?  Oh, God.  And it's like, oh, my God, you can't fucking do this.  Stop it.  And then the grandkids are there and his kids.  It's like, oh, my.  How do you not cry?  Horrible.  Well, I tell you, all of that, the old soldier shit, like Band of Brothers at the end of Band 
[03:41:30]  of Brothers, where they show the real guys, the real soldiers that were there.  And they're not young anymore.  And they're crying over lost buddies from fucking 50 years ago.  What about that, we were watching it yesterday, the World War II in HD.  World War II in HD.  You know, they tell the stories, but then there's a few of these guys that are still alive.  And they go to them, and they're talking about how this one guy, I remember, I mean, he was  older than anything, and he was talking about how he got his guys into this situation.  Oh, yeah.  And he knew that he had to get them out.  And it wasn't his job to fight.  It was his job to get them out of this situation. 
[03:42:00]  Get them out, because they were pinned down, machine gunners were all over the place.  And he goes, we're going to have to sit here until it gets dark out and leave.  So they just hunkered down, and one young kid gets up and starts getting up, and he  goes, get down, get down.  The guy pulls his head up, boom, killed him.  And he goes, I wish, you know, somehow I could have tackled that kid.  Like, you know that kid is haunting that fucking guy.  I mean, Private Ryan was some real stuff, but I mean, this is real because it is real.  Yeah, it's real shit.  Dude, by the way, that goddamn World War II in HD, I've been watching that, is amazing. 
[03:42:30]  I got to check it out.  It's all, like, color.  The difference between your attachment to a situation in black and white film or color  film is totally different.  You watch World War II in black and white, you're so separated from it that you really  don't feel like it's real, or it was so long ago that they weren't real people.  Right, of course.  They're like, you get this weird feeling.  When you see it in color and see those soldiers' faces sitting there just shell-shocked, like 
[03:43:00]  waiting, or Guadalcanal, and they're just, they've been through the mill, and they got  that look on their face, and it's in color?  You, all of a sudden, you're going, holy shit, that guy's like...  It just seems a lot realer, right?  That's just the guy, and...  Can I ask the dumb question?  Yeah.  Do they colorize it?  No, it was color film.  Really?  They found a bunch of color film that's never before seen on TV, or a lot of it hasn't  been seen before on TV, and yeah, there were still color films back then.  Remember when they were trying to, like, colorize all the black and white films? 
[03:43:30]  Oh, shit.  That went away, right?  Yeah.  They have, but they have, and there was one guy that they're talking about, and he wrote  a letter back home, and it's like, yeah, things are getting quiet.  He goes, I think the war will be over soon, and blah, blah, blah.  He's talking about that.  He goes, well, I got to catch some sleep, you know, I'll write again soon, and it's  like, his parents got that letter at the same time they got a telegram saying that he was  dead, and then it didn't even say the circumstance. 
[03:44:00]  So many people were dying that they couldn't even say, well, he charged up a hill and was  shot as he saved this guy.  It was just, he died.  They know ifs, ands, or buts, or why, or how, or nothing.  You just got to deal with not even knowing where, how, who.  He just either, you know, was in a car accident, driving in a Jeep, or he saved 20 guys and  was gunned down.  God bless their military and their families.  I just don't know how you deal with that.  By the way, someone said the knife scene in Private Ryan. 
[03:44:30]  That didn't make me cry.  No, that was fucking just frightening.  That didn't make me cry.  The Tom Hanks death scene, and then like Ant was saying, at the grave as an old guy,  it's just brutal.  I mean, there's other times in that movie, you're like, oh, fuck.  And the end of Band of Brothers, where he gives the speech about, oh, you gotta see that  whole fucking thing, where the actual, one of the actual guys, you know, obviously old,  is talking about, you know, how, he goes, my grandson asked me if I was a hero in the  war, and I said, no, but I served in the company of them. 
[03:45:00]  Wow.  And he was all emotional and choked up.  Dude, you just gave me chills.  Dude, it's fucking crazy.  You just gave me chills with that.  I wasn't wearing long sleeves.  You see mine.  Yeah.  It's crazy.  Look at Anthony.  I get all fucking emotional with that shit.  Look at Anthony opening up with his emotions.  Get Lydia on the phone.  We have a breakthrough today.  A break.  There's been a breakthrough.  And they had the advertising, I think it was on Before Curb or After Curb for Pacific?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, fuck. 
[03:45:30]  That looks good.  Pacific's coming on us.  That's Hanks and what?  Spielberg?  Yeah, it's the same Band of Brothers people.  Same people that did Band of Brothers doing the Pacific Theater.  And the head guy in there, one of the main characters, is the little kid from Jurassic  Park, the little boy.  Oh, really?  All growed up.  Yeah.  I hate when they grow up.  Ah.  Uncle Paul.  I cry like a bitch at the end of The Bucket List.  I didn't see The Bucket List.  The Bucket List.  I would fucking, I would watch it.  I got a story about my dad comforting my mom at a funeral. 
[03:46:00]  You know, I'll tell you something about my parents.  You know, when the older relatives start dying off, you go to those wakes.  My parents were the cool ones in the back of the room making jokes and having fun.  Yeah, yeah.  You gotta do that.  And they had a nice group around them that kind of lightened the mode.  They weren't the over-the-top relative bringing everyone down to a level that you don't want  to be at.  But, yeah, when my grandfather died, my mother's father, it was, that was a while ago.  And my mother, obviously younger at the time, she goes to the funeral. 
[03:46:30]  I'm at the funeral.  And when the priest says, you know, the ashes to ashes shit and you throw the fucking rose  in there, my mother just goes like, like, like, starts like crying a little bit.  And I am Mr. Uncomfortable in that situation.  So I felt like I had to do something.  So I just kind of put my arm on her, my hand on her shoulder and very standoffish, awkward  Anthony doesn't know what to do.  Right.  And then recently, her mother just passed away recently.  And it's just like, all right, when we get the fuck out of here to go eat, yeah, we'll 
[03:47:00]  go back to the house.  We'll grab something to fucking eat and whatever.  Oh, look at this.  When this asshole die.  As we're walking past, you know, tombstones, totally different.  As they get older, they just like, something happens.  It's nice to know that your death means the whole family gets together at an inexpensive  restaurant and gets some kind of deal on a nice lunch for everybody.  We did it over my aunt and uncle's house.  Just, you know, hero sandwiches, some macaroni and shit like that.  Yeah, your life is worth a six foot hero in someone's backyard.  That's it.  That's comforting. 
[03:47:30]  Eh, whatever.  That's it.  You're in the ground.  I'm hungry.  And by Monday, they're back at work.  Jesus.  Life is really fucked up.  A river dare cheese.  Hey, hey, hey, no one join.

Shit!  Oh my God!  Like out of shock, but not out of like terror.  No.  Some girls are screaming out of terror.  Why?  They thought they might get a penis helmet on their forehead or something?  Yeah.  Well, the guy did run up to some woman and knock that shit out of her hands when she was trying to walk up the stairs. 
[03:53:00]  I don't understand what the cop was doing.  He really let that shit get a little out of hand.  I think he was waiting for backup.  Can we watch this shit?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The sounds are great.  When he just starts yelling nigger and Jew, he just, this guy was all over the place.  Naked, racist guy.  It's a viral video, but you have to turn your head completely to the left.  Sideways.  Some people have fixed it.  Can we tilt the monitor?  They corrected it. 
[03:53:30]  Some people corrected the video.  Well, that's smart.  So, there's, like, LiveLeak, I think, has it corrected.  So, this is what?  The 6th Train?  Yeah.  6th Train, Subway.  Yeah, LiveLeak has it in the corrected format.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Okay.  Somebody took it and tilted it the right way.  Ah, crazy Subway maniac.  Love that guy.  Let's see.  It's got to be, like, somewhere very, very close. 
[03:54:00]  I think they would just keep it up on their front page.  You would think like that.  What's wrong with these people?  What's bigger than that right now?  What's more important than that?  Give it its own spot.  Naked Subway.  That's all you got to put.  Where is he?  Come on.  I just watched it.  Come on.  Yeah, maybe it was a copyright thing, though.  Maybe.  You think?  I don't know.  A copyright thing.  Because it would have been right there.  And what happens to everybody else's video that you see?  Because they're all videoing this.  Like, so what happens to everyone else's?  Where is it? 
[03:54:30]  I don't know.  They haven't uploaded it?  Some people are just...  Yeah, they film shit and then go, who?  You know, they just show their friends.  There were at least 20 people I saw in there with their phones out.  There should be 20 angles of this thing.  Yeah.  It's a biggie.  All right, we can go sideways.  It's fine.  Yeah.  I just want to...  So he's slowly taking his clothes off.  Niggas.  Huh?  Niggas.  Niggas. 
[03:55:00]  Niggas.  No, you get the fuck up.  You get the fuck up.  You get the fuck up.  Huh?  Shoot me.  Shoot me, nigga.  Shoot me.  Huh?  Guy's laughing.  Fuck you.  Huh?  See?  Ah!  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  What do you got the fuck up?  Huh?  Put history in there.  Fuck off.  Have you seen? 
[03:55:30]  Have you seen?  Is it going to get the fuck up?  I got to get the fuck up.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  There he is.  Ah!  What the Jews?  What the Jews?  What the Jews?  What the Jews?  Jews?  Jews?  Jews?  And he's yelling at the Jews.  Fucking Jews?  You can tell when he takes the fuck up just from the sound of the crowd.  that that's the towers coming down you're right  now he's completely naked yeah where's the cop cop's like right there now he's just running 
[03:56:00]  around the platform his big hairy fucking busts yeah they're a tiny schmeckle running up the  stairs grab something out of a lady's hand and slammed it down on the ground yeah  that was just sort of attacking people and now he's uh he's very close to the edge of the platform  and now the cop is trying to apprehend him  and some of the bystanders are helping 
[03:56:30]  he's wily  he's fighting uh some citizens getting involved helping the officer uh subdue  and look at all the phones are out  everyone just taking pictures this guy's bugging 
[03:57:00]  oh yeah what happened  yeah they kind of got him cuffed and uh  but the cop really stood  i noticed black guys and hispanic guys whenever they uh video something from their phone at some 
[03:57:30]  point they have to turn the phone to their face and say something like this should be crazy  and then go back to you know the action they like getting their own credit it's kind of entertaining  man this happened at the chuck and cheese and then back to action  no it's the best part i'm gonna put this shit on the youtube  right and then back to the action it's there you know right on their face  he'd be bugging  he'd be bugging 
[03:58:00]  what's that  that nigga be cray cray  wham right back  he'd be bugging is that old school  he'd be bugging his old school  i don't think they do that  i don't know if that guy was bugging  what i want to know  so he's yelling the n-word like crazy  yeah  and that's a  that's a cop was a black guy  but the rest of the train  that's like a black train in that area  they don't care  because that guy was crazy  he was so crazy that they  right  it's laughable at that point  right  it negates the n-word  from a white guy  from a white guy  when you're that crazy  wow 
[03:58:30]  because then they're just laughing at it  like one of their buddies said it  right  see so if you act crazy  you could say it  you could say it  but you gotta act that crazy  that's the  that's the line of crazy  you gotta be  when you could just blurt that out  on the sixth train  and there's no consequences  no repercussions  for you know  he got arrested  for being naked  with his schmeckle out  yeah  his little schmeckle  yeah  but if he was just a businessman  right  and the door opened  and there's a black cop standing there  and he just started yelling that out the door 
[03:59:00]  at the cop  uh people in the train would be going  hey hey motherfucker  what you saying  what you saying  and there could be a problem  what you say  but when he's taking his uh  underwear off  and showing his big hairy cock  uh he could yell whatever he wants  gotta trim that shit down  racial epithets mean nothing  with your dick hanging out on a subway  is the bird nest still in  the bird nest  is that still in  with the two eggs  and the mama bird  or the baby  oh that's a baby bird  waiting to be fed  yeah hard to get a rod 
[03:59:30]  while you're yelling uh  uh nigger and Jew  while you're naked on a train  I think at the very least  you gotta trim your fucking bird's nest  yeah yeah  I don't know if he left  his house in the morning  thinking that was gonna be his day though  true  so you know to shave  it's like I'm just gonna lose my shit  I'm going batshit  on the sixth train  let me trim down  just in case I take my boxes off  and run naked  yelling racial epithets  at police officers  what I'm learning  uh  you know cause I do 
[04:00:00]  I do some street videos  whatever  nothing like this obviously  but people from the rest of the country  are shocked  like  oh yeah  that this shit happens in New York City  yeah New York  they really are shocked  I just assume that  this kind of crap happens in  in every city  certainly  in every town  you got this weird shit going on  but  I'm learning  more and more of that  no man  this is just a very unique place  you know what it is  and everybody that was watching this  after that guy was cuffed  uh  all  got on their trains  went to work 
[04:00:30]  did whatever they had to do  anywhere else in the country  maybe L.A. or something like that  but anywhere else  like the Midwest and stuff  right  those people would have had to have gone home  right  shaken  right  and been like  oh my god  I can't go to work today  I can't believe what I saw today  yeah  here would you  like freak out  but we just  back to work  I'm only learning that recently  I really am  it's crazy  I thought that  this is just  uh  you know  it's our melting pot  yeah  that video I made  with the black guy  with the chain  really thick chain 
[04:01:00]  and he's yelling the end word  and Osama Bin Laden  Osama Bin Laden  if you  if you look at that video  fuck  fuck the action  look at the people  that's what I study  and they're  they're going by this  insane  scene that's going on  and they're just on their phones  another guy I think  is ordering a pretzel  doesn't matter  guys walking out of Starbucks  with coffee  and this shit is going on  right in front of them  and no one's stopping to watch  it's just a  it's like oh  another crazy person  in the streets of New York  there's so many people 
[04:01:30]  it's such a  an urban environment  it's you know  a lot of people working  a lot of homeless people  all mixed together  you know  we don't have it separated  where there's a  you know  this nice area  and then you gotta go  way the fuck away  to get to a bad area  and stuff  it's all like intermingled  so we kind of learn  to just live with each other  and look and go  oh well that's happening  great  there's a guy  with his pants off  and his hairy dick  and he's yelling  nigger out the fucking  subway door 
[04:02:00]  alright  I'm just gonna go  grab a pretzel  and uh  you know  I should have watched  that video closer  were there people  on the subway  just not even  paying attention  oh yeah yeah yeah  just looking at their  phones and stuff  yeah just people  like uh  and that woman  walking up the stairs  was just trying  to get somewhere  right  guy ran up  she didn't even  give a shit  right  guy's naked  she wasn't running away  no  she was just walking  and the guy slapped  like some kind of  merchandise out of her hand  that is so fucking weird  man  it's an odd situation  uh 
[04:02:30]  I'd like to actually  speak to uh  Kenny  who just walked in  about this  Kenny  did you see the video  no sir  I'm behind  in the times  oh  oh Kenny  this is a viral video  that is everywhere  this is something  crazy naked guy  at least show the  beginning again  so Kenny  could get a little  thinker  because you used  to be a law  enforcement officer  um  I just want  your take  on how the cop  handled this  I think he  I think he was  a little over 
[04:03:00]  cautious  because some  civilians  seem to have  been in  some danger  from this guy  he was able  to get close  enough  he's yelling  the uh  the n-word  that's a  the officer  was an  african-american  gentleman  see now  the officer  is standing  outside the  train  he's in 
[04:03:30]  the train  now the  pants are  around his  ankles  wouldn't you  think that's  a good time  to take  him down  but the  cop lets  him take  his pants  off completely  now his  legs are  all freed  up  now he's  yelling  Jews  Jews  punching the  subway  fucking  Jews  and then  he  and then  off come  his  boxers  the crowd 
[04:04:00]  just going  in hysterics  now  and he  leaves the  train  now the  officer's  right outside  the door  of the  train  he lets  him walk  out and  start getting  into the  crowd  and if  you watch  a woman  walking up  the stairs  and is  accosted  by this  gentleman  and the  officer's  still standing  there  he should have  grabbed him  as soon as he  left the  subway  right  now  and then he's  subdued by  the officer 
[04:04:30]  on the  side of  the platform  with the  help of  many  citizens  and that's  pretty much  it  now Kenny  your professional  assessment of  that situation  what happened  there  the cops  in a no  win  situation  really  yeah because  you're damned  if you do  you're damned  if you don't  you make that  up  and there's  too many  witnesses  around to  do what  you really  need to  do  now what  what did  he need  to do  to that  guy  well he  when you  first see 
[04:05:00]  the clip  he's calling  for backup  right obviously  right  and the  guys you  know  what they  call an  EDP  emotionally  disturbed  person  apparently  so  yes  yes  plus he's  probably a  dirty  filthy  stinking  homeless  guy  right  and he's  naked  yeah  yeah  so the  guy doesn't  want to  wrestle around  with him  alone  yeah  so he's  waiting  because  you know  if this was  like the  movies  like you 
[04:05:30]  just walk  up to him  you hit him  with your  cocoa bola  one shot  over the  head  and that's  it  right  but like  when he  went after  that lady  on the  stairs  yeah  that you  know  he may  he might  maybe  like  you know  who am  I to  say  to second  guess  somebody  exactly  but  but I'm  thinking  especially  when he  went after  the lady  on the  stairs  there were  points  beforehand  when his  pants were  around his  ankles  and he  went to  take that  last one  off  I think  the officer  probably  could have  charged in 
[04:06:00]  crossbody  blocked him  and just  knocked him  right on the  floor  then with  his pants  around his  ankles  he let that  opportunity  get away  now the  guy's  completely  naked  roaming  around  the  platform  then when  he's  going up  the stairs  to accost  that woman  you got  the stairs  as your  assistant  he could  have hit  him from  behind  and face  planted  him on the  stairs  again I'm  not second  guessing either  this guy's  in this  situation  I'm just  saying I  saw a couple  of opportunities  where this guy  didn't have to be  wandering around  the platform  with his dick 
[04:06:30]  hanging out  there's more  than one way  to skin a  cat  is that what  you're saying  I mean you're  absolutely right  when his pants  were down there  you could have  maybe tackled  him good  but then now  what now you  got to roll  around with this  guy because  believe me when  people don't  want to get  locked up and  people don't  want to get  handcuffed and  the adrenaline  is going  it ain't easy  sometimes  you don't want  his dick  rubbing on  you  yeah  so like  you know  all's well  that ended  well  so you  now  let's say 
[04:07:00]  an officer  like you  not you  yourself  not like me  I was  professional  I'm saying  like a  dirty Harry  a dirty Harry  kind of guy  let's say  let's say  he worked  in Jersey  or something  I'm just  picking a state  what would  have happened  to this guy  before cameras  were all over  the place  before the  cameras ruined  police work  I know  before the  pesky cell phone  yes the  pesky citizen  and his cell  phone  what would  have happened  to this guy  Kenny  well I saw 
[04:07:30]  on TV once  right right  it was in a  fast food joint  yeah  and a couple  of walking  cops went in  to take their  meal break  and there was  a security  guard in there  and he like  just told the  cops how he  threw a kid  out for like  spitting in  the salad  bar  oh crap  all right  so the  cops sit  down with  their meal  all right  and here  comes this  kid back  in because  nobody's  going to  tell him  what to  do  and now  he's  showing off  in front  of a few  females  oh boy 
[04:08:00]  all right  so the  certain cop  gets up  from his meal  do we have a  description of  this perp  yeah you know  Jesus  all right  yeah you  know  so so so  the cop you  know he gets  one bite out  of his burger  you know and  he goes over  and they go  and they go  like look  they asked you  to go why  don't you just  go  sounds reasonable  nobody's telling  me what to do 
[04:08:30]  so the cops  trying to like  do the right  thing and be  nice and look  the cop goes  look i asked  you nicely  to leave  you don't want  to leave  now i'm telling  you you gotta  go oh boy  i'm quoting  this movie cop  right right  the cop from  the movie  so so the  guy's like  nobody's telling  me what to  do he's  showing off  in front of  the females  so the cop  grabs him  out of the  chair throws  him on the  table and  when the cop  reaches back  for his  handcuff the  guy spins  around off the  table and  punches him 
[04:09:00]  in the face  oh shit  so the next  thing you know  this cop and  and this  perp are  rolling around  all over the  floor of this  fast food joint  there's a  bruckheimer  movie yeah  it was some  kind of action  action movie  yeah now  this cop he  knows there's  like a lot of  witnesses around  because there's  other people in  the fast food  joint who  weren't the  same minority  as him  yes and  and and now  he's wondering  there's three  other cops like  what like what 
[04:09:30]  are they doing  when this cop's  rolling all over  the floor with  this guy  crazy  you know  so so so  then like I  guess the cop  got like tired  of just like  wrestling around  with that guy  and he pulled  out his slapper  and just like  hit the guy  till the guy  just like didn't  want to get hit  no more and  gave up  right and then  he looks up  and the other  cop because the  cop that was  wrestling around  you know you  lose your  handcuffs your  flashlight your  radio everything 
[04:10:00]  you lose  everything right  you know when  you're rolling  around and  and the cop  looks up and  the one cop  is standing  there with  his handcuffs  like hanging  on his finger  like here like  hand like he  was nice enough  to hand the  other cop the  handcuffs he  dropped  that doesn't  sound like a  very good you  know partnering  yeah yeah yeah  so then so the  guy gets cuffed  up the cop calls  from backup and  all his friends  come from the  other side of  town to like  help him now  and clear the  joint out right 
[04:10:30]  and and that  mutt gets charged  with like aggravated  assault resisting  arrest and the  whole thing but  you know the game  they play is they  they counter  charge the cop  oh yeah so  now so now the  cop gets  counter charged  with the  aggravated assault  possessional weapon  because he hit  him with a  slapper you know  and it's going to  go to grand jury  you know and  and and you got  uh you know a  pba attorney you  know whose  nickname is like  five to ten if  you're lucky  this sounds great 
[04:11:00]  i gotta see a  great movie yeah  yeah yeah and  this can you get  on netflix is  it streaming yeah  yeah and you  know the kid you  know he he was a  high school senior  but he happened  to be 19 years  old you know  really know the  details of this  flick and i saw  it a few times  oh yeah well i  would watch it a  lot too it sounds  very good so  then like action  packed you know  you gotta end up  like uh dropping  the charges and  then it's like a 
[04:11:30]  wash oh so it's a  wash so the kid  walks away yeah  with nothing and  well a few bruises  away with nothing  and they give that  look to each other  in the courtroom like  god you son of a  bitch especially  especially when  you gotta worry  about like in  some opinion  maybe a racist  cop that said  he would have  testified against  the other cop  because he  instigated the  whole thing  how that could  have happened  you know it's  beyond me but  yeah you know  there was a lot 
[04:12:00]  of racial tension  back in the day  back in the day  and that's when  this movie took  place oh yeah  another part of  this movie i mean  back in the day  fights in the  locker rooms  wow really  it got so bad  yeah it got so  bad like two  radio cars would  pull up in an  intersection of a  red light and  guys would get  out and just  start beating  each other at  the fucking red  light  you gotta see  the good old  days  this movie has  a lot of twists  and turns  yeah it really  does  cops used to 
[04:12:30]  keep their  cocaine rolled  up in their  gun barrel  you know that  was back before  you had a study  for a piss  test  who's the  romantic lead  in this movie  yes was there  a love story  a love angle  was there a  love story  that's great  it was interwoven  it should be  yeah the love  angle is  you know like  in a ghetto  precinct  yeah  the Caucasian  officers you  know just  because they're 
[04:13:00]  in that  environment  you know there's  some jungle  fever  oh okay  yeah yeah  yeah  so they ended  up like leaving  their wives  and screwing  up their  marriage  wow  you know for  a little brown  sugar  sounds like  almost like  fort apache  the bronx  i saw that  movie years  ago  yeah  yeah  hardcore  wow  that's good  a good  two thumbs  up for this  movie  oh yeah  every finger  the middle  finger  that's a hell 
[04:13:30]  well kenny's  movie reviews  again i love  kenny's movie  reviews when he  talks about  yeah  it's been a  while  these old cop  movies that  he's watched  over the years  so you know  this guy  like he did  a right for  himself  yeah  like he could  have been a tad  more aggressive  more aggressive  he could have  grabbed as soon as  he got off the  train  because it seems  like a few  citizens might  not have to  have been  subject to that  you're listening  to the worst  of the opian  anthony show  on sirius xm 
[04:14:00]  there was a  bidet in my  in my suite  at the bellagio  and i had wiped  my ass probably  eleven times  by this point  it was like  we were just  dabbing paper  against your  fucking raw  asshole  like you have  fucking salt  and vinegar  potato chip  asshole  and if i  finally gave in  and used the  bidet i straddled  it facing the  wall  and i was  that's not the  way you use it  yes it is  you were on it  backwards  he was trick  riding like an  old west  wild west show  no i'll tell  you why it's
