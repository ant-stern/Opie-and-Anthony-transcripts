<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts complaining about their experiences hailing cabs in the rain, transitioning into a harsh critique of David Lee Roth's new radio show, calling it a "train wreck" due to its lack of preparation and over-reliance on Van Halen stories.  Numerous listener calls echoed these sentiments, with one caller even impersonating their eccentric former boss, Bruce.  Another caller mentioned a negative review from David Hinckley.  The discussion extended to a broader critique of Infinity Broadcasting's new Free FM format, comparing it unfavorably to their own past success and Howard Stern's.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to playing and discussing an audio clip of Howard Stern's daughter, Emily, performing a sexually suggestive and blasphemous theatrical piece.  The hosts and callers reacted with varying degrees of amusement and shock.  A call from a woman claiming to be Flea's mother followed, during which the hosts engaged in sexually suggestive and crude questioning about her physical attributes and sexual experience; she eventually ended the call.

The show then moved to a song dedication, followed by a segment mocking radio DJ Debra Stern of "The Breeze" for her repetitive use of the word "phenomenal."  Listener calls continued, transitioning into discussions about Dick Clark's post-stroke New Year's Eve appearance, the VH1 show "Flavor of Love" (with focus on Flavor Flav and the contestants' behavior), and a mocking commentary on Richard Simmons' appearance on another show.  The hosts introduced the concept of "anti-free radio commercials," playing an example containing offensive language.  Further discussion of "Flavor of Love," more listener calls (including advice on dealing with a grumpy husband), and brainstorming for a "camel toe" reality show filled out this segment.  The section ended with the hosts engaging in playful banter and silly nicknames.

The show shifted gears, opening with sound effects and mentioning a planned segment featuring a retiree production of *The Wizard of Oz* and an upcoming guest appearance by Bill Burr.  The hosts discussed their upcoming trip to CES in Las Vegas, complaining about the early flight times.  This led to a discussion about their frustration with the show's organizers.  One host declared his new mantra as "fuck everyone."  This was followed by the airing and discussion of more anti-free radio commercials created by Steve, including a lewd one and another featuring the offensive character Toby.  The hosts debated the strategy of these commercials and criticized Penn Jillette's stance.

A caller named Lily recounted a sexually explicit encounter with comedian Jimmy Norton, engaging in a detailed back-and-forth with the hosts. A call with Big Kev, who had recently undergone extensive abdominal surgery resulting in the removal of 40 pounds of skin, followed.  Big Kev discussed the procedure, complications, and insensitive humor from the hosts ensued, culminating in Opie hanging up after Big Kev's text message.  Further discussion of this call,  Bill Burr's upcoming appearance, and a caller who hadn't listened in 18 months due to lack of satellite radio filled the next portion.  The show briefly touched upon a 9/11 benefit show and a comedianâ€™s experience with an audience member crying during a joke.

Finally, the show included a segment featuring audio clips from a theatrical production of *The Wizard of Oz* performed by intellectually disabled individuals.  The hosts, along with in-studio guests Nick Swardson (promoting his movie *Grandma's Boy*) and Bill Burr, repeatedly used derogatory terms like "retarded" to describe the performance and performers.  They commented on various awkward moments and unusual directorial choices.  A caller, Joe, shared his and his girlfriend's contrasting opinions on the performance, with his girlfriend, who worked with autistic individuals, finding it upsetting. This segment also included several anti-free radio commercials made by people with intellectual disabilities.

[00:03:30]  CastingWords  CastingWords  but the no-compete portion is up until October.  No arrests have been made.  Police are still investigating.  We're open! We're open!  Let's do it!  The blonde one.  These are called radio shock dogs.  Our society needs borders.  Needs parameters.  You dick! 
[00:04:00]  They get their dollies by saying,  let's keep pushing the envelope.  They were doing what they were paid to do.  Even when there are bucks to be made,  there's a price to be paid  in terms of the cultural degradation  that we do not want to be associated with anymore.  Are you adequately prepared to rock, rock, rock?  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:04:30]  Are you ready?  How about you?  God damn it! 
[00:05:00]  Are you fucking with me?  Oh, no.  Turn on his mic and let him go.  Hi, Jimmy.  Good morning, sunshine.  Right off the bat, let me say, 
[00:05:30]  everyone is pissed off today.  There isn't one person in this studio  that isn't just fucking livid.  I haven't said hi to Anthony yet,  and I'm now saying hi to Jimmy  at 7.06 on the East Coast.  Oh.  You had the same problem I did.  It's a nor'easter coming through the New York area.  Oh, uh-oh.  And of course, that means everyone is just  out of their minds  and don't know how to handle themselves out there.  And I usually rollerblade into work.  I love rollerblading into work.  You've done it pretty much every day 
[00:06:00]  throughout the winter,  even on, like, some snowy days.  So far, so good.  Yeah, I rarely take a cab.  But it's raining so hard out there today,  I had to take a cab.  I couldn't find a cab.  I'm setting up Jimmy here.  I couldn't find a cab.  Let me tell you what happened to me.  After standing in the rain for 10 or 15 minutes,  an off-duty cab stops.  That's the only way I would have got in.  I couldn't find a cab whatsoever.  Here's my friend.  Here's the deal.  I jump in.  I go, hey, you're off-duty.  He goes, yeah, I got to go back to the garage. 
[00:06:30]  My brakes aren't working.  Ah.  So now I'm just white-knuckling it  all the way to the station going,  oh, great.  Thanks for telling me.  No brakes.  I figured he would get a fare on the way back to Queens,  you know, back to the cab garage or whatever.  Yeah, make a few extra bucks.  So the whole time I'm thinking his brakes could go at any second.  Yeah.  I mean, what the fuck?  Who the?  And he's not slowing down, you know.  He's just forcing the issue like all cabbies do out there  and jamming on the brakes at the last second at red lights. 
[00:07:00]  I'm like, oh, great.  Way to be cautious.  Can't stand them all.  Knowing that your brake lights are on.  All of them.  But anyway, Jimmy, for the last 45 minutes,  has been calling saying he can't find a cab.  I literally, it's probably about 40 minutes.  I left the house before 630.  And I stood out on this corner and I couldn't get,  I'm not even mad at anybody.  It's not like it's anybody's fault.  It's not, I just.  Yes, sir, there is.  You just haven't found them yet.  It's got to be someone's fault.  I was fucking, I almost cried.  I was so angry waiting for a fucking taxi. 
[00:07:30]  I was like so, I'm 14 blocks from here  and it took me over 35 minutes to get here.  I was fucking.  And it's one of those rains, you really can't walk it  because it's coming down like sideways.  Blown in your face.  Blown in your face.  Little needles.  Yeah.  There's so many people that wanted cabs.  Dude, there was no one driving by me.  Oh, this is the deal in New York.  When it rains, it's really, really tough to find a cab.  Really tough.  You just got to luck out.  You got to have a cab stop in front of you  to let somebody out.  It's because everybody's, no one's walking.  No.  Is that it? 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, all the people that would be walking  or maybe even taking the subway.  Besides, you don't see anyone out there,  yet you don't see a cab either.  You're just alone.  But see, the subway, the subways as well,  you have to walk to the subway,  and then when you get out of the subway,  you got to walk some time.  So some of these people that have a little extra money,  they go, you know what, today's the day  just to go door to door with a cab.  Take the cab.  Yeah, so it's a pain in the ass.  You wind up getting very protective of the corner  you're standing on, too.  I was literally standing on this corner.  My doorman jinxed me.  I wanted to fucking smash his face.  See?  There you go.  You're mad at somebody.  It's going to be a tough...  Yeah, but he did jinx me. 
[00:08:30]  It's his fault.  Kill him.  It's going to be a rough one today.  Get in the cab, and I was like,  shut the fuck up,  and I stood there for a half hour on the corner.  You started to get very protective of your corners,  and so you could go over there.  You literally...  I wanted to punch somebody in the face.  It was like one little white guy in an umbrella,  and I'm like,  I hope you try to take my cab, you fucking cunt.  I was so angry.  If he was larger and black,  I probably would have went to Broadway and got one there.  You see the people go down the block  a little further from you?  Yeah, with traffic coming towards you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  With traffic coming towards you,  and they're going to, like,  jab you for a cab?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's so funny you just said that,  because I walked across the street 
[00:09:00]  because I thought there was a guy  that may be, you know,  attempting to get a cab as well.  I'm like, no fucking way,  not this morning, buddy.  I wound up having...  I confronted a guy one time  when I was...  It was the same problem.  It was one of those rainy mornings,  and this little fat Indian guy  who I've since seen doing it,  so I kind of like him now  because he obviously walks out of the house  three minutes before he's got to be on his train,  set of balls on him.  Yeah, he's just a creep,  and I'm waiting for a cab,  and there's a cab coming,  and he literally tries to run in front of my cab,  and he's going,  oh, oh, oh, oh,  with his arms flailing.  I've got to be on a train to D.C. 
[00:09:30]  And I'm like, I don't care.  I've got to be on the fucking radio.  And I jumped in.  I had to trump him  because I have no other job that he does.  Awesome.  I love those people.  You see them everywhere,  in stores, everything.  Oh, I just have this.  Oh, two seconds.  It's at the bank.  I'm just cashing this.  Yeah, I'm doing the same thing, asshole.  Get the fuck behind me.  Yeah, I told the story Thanksgiving  where that guy, you know,  cut the line  as we're all waiting to get into a parking lot.  Yeah.  Oh, I got kids waiting at a restaurant.  I'm like, are you fucking kidding me?  Yeah, I got you.  Move!  Or there's going to be a problem. 
[00:10:00]  Out of the way.  You know, well, Anthony has his own problem,  but we have to comment about this.  Get Ben in here.  Ben and I have been laughing for the last hour.  Kurt will explain.  Kurt in Cleveland.  Dude, David Lee Roth is unlistenable,  and I am the biggest diehard Van Halen fan on the planet,  and I can't even stomach it.  Let me tell you something, man.  They're paying David Lee Roth about $4 million a year.  Diamond, Dave.  Ben and I were listening for the last hour.  For the rest of the country, you know, 
[00:10:30]  Howard retired basically from radio,  and they got a new guy in, David Lee Roth.  We all know him from Van Halen,  and he's taken over a lot of the East Coast markets.  I think he's in, I don't know, New York, Boston.  Yeah, whatever.  And maybe he's not in your city,  but we're like everyone else here in New York.  We're like, yeah, we got to hear what David Lee Roth sounds like.  Whoa!  I got newspapers writing me to, like, you know,  listen to David Lee Roth and give some comments, you know,  because we're getting comments from radio people.  I'm like, no problem.  So we're listening for an hour. 
[00:11:00]  Like Kurt is saying, it's unlistenable.  It's train wreck radio that'll be fun to listen to  for maybe two or three weeks,  and then after that it's just going to be get rid of this crap.  Dude, I understand first day, first show,  you got to give it a break,  but I'd rather listen to Dick Clark sounding like Frankie Blue  than listen to this.  Let me tell you, we've been in radio a long time.  I'll tell you why David Lee Roth is in serious trouble.  He's not taking it serious.  He's had a long time to get his new show together, 
[00:11:30]  and he's doing New Year's resolutions today.  That's like, Jimmy, whoo-hoo, he's ripping you off.  That was my idea.  Remember, I said we should do them.  New Year's resolutions is the hackiest radio big ever.  Is that like a cheesy radio thing with the music real quiet  in the background, and the minute he stops talking,  it comes up real loud again,  and then it fades back when he starts talking again?  What is that?  Eek.  I've met David Lee Roth.  Jimmy has hung with David Lee Roth.  He's a really nice guy,  but I guarantee he went into this job. 
[00:12:00]  He's not taking it serious,  and I bet you he even told the guys in Infinity,  which amazes me that they would listen to this,  I'm just going to wing it.  I'm going to wing it.  My personality is such that I'm just going to wing it.  Don't you guys worry.  Just turn on my mic, and I'm just going to wing it.  Holy shit, these guys have no idea how hard it is  to entertain a radio audience.  Well, thank God for satellite, man.  All right.  Thanks, Kurt.  What kind of deal do you think he signed?  Probably a three-month deal.  You think?  Really? 
[00:12:30]  I don't know.  I mean, listen.  You don't think they put him in there for a year?  At least a year.  Hey, 363 more days to go.  Woo!  He has nothing.  He's singing over songs.  Like I said, it's kind of fun to listen to,  but after a few weeks, you're going to be like,  all right, what else you got, buddy?  Yeah.  And you're going to realize he has nothing else.  He's going to run out of his Van Halen stories  and his rope stories.  Yeah, he's telling Van Halen stories.  They had a caller call in and asked him,  you know, he's like, I'm a huge fan.  He's like, you like me better than Sammy? 
[00:13:00]  And that's all they talked about.  And they were talking about what City's Van Halen played in.  I mean, he makes Mason and Kalinsky look like,  you know, the greatest video show ever.  Yeah.  It's so fun to listen to.  It's so fun to see that our whole company  still just can't figure this fucking thing out.  Sammy just loves when Ben talks.  This is why I love Ben.  Because I know Ben said,  Ben was basically saying that he thinks the show stinks,  but he didn't have a good comparison.  He just said,  they make Mason and Kalinsky sound like  the greatest show ever. 
[00:13:30]  It's like Ben's behind the scenes.  It's awful.  It's awful.  And then he's like,  hey, play track four.  Then like U2's Vertigo starts up  and he's just singing along.  It's like,  he's singing over.  He's like,  yeah!  Oh, that's what people want to hear.  At least that was a song he recognized.  The other songs he was singing over  were just crap.  Yeah,  it's some crappy black music.  He's like,  this is my new favorite band.  He played two tracks from them.  Hey,  it's Ross.  Hey,  it's Ross.  And his live reads are terrible too.  He's doing live reads for Vermont Teddy Bear. 
[00:14:00]  And a lot of people will go,  give the guy a break,  it's his first day.  But he's had a long time to prepare for this day  and it's obvious he has nothing planned.  So he's just going to wing it  with his great personality.  Oh,  good luck to you,  buddy.  Godspeed.  Good luck,  bro.  Good luck,  bro.  Good fucking luck,  bro.  Yeah.  Stupid Infinity Broadcasting.  They're trying to do,  for the rest of the country,  you know,  Howard retired.  So they're starting this new station,  Free FM.  Yep.  Because they see a lot of people  going to satellite radio, 
[00:14:30]  so they're like,  why should radio,  why should you have to pay for radio?  So they'll counter it  by calling it Free FM  to remind people  that this is free.  And they're playing  a shitload of commercials.  So there's your free radio.  There's your free.  You still have to sit through  a bunch of commercial crap.  It's the worst reaction  I've ever seen a company have.  To call it Free FM  and take the music,  it's horrendous.  Not only that,  it's the old K-Rock  here in New York,  which did pretty well.  And now it's called  K-W-F-N-Y or something. 
[00:15:00]  Something like that.  Free New York.  Free New York  or something like that.  I'm just kidding, man.  I think that's the call letters.  And basically,  it's going to be  a whole lineup of talk shows  catering to guys.  Younger males,  like let's say 18 or 49,  I believe,  would be their main demo.  And they're attempting  to do that  without the Howard Stern show,  without the Opie and Anthony show.  Instead,  you've got David Lee Roth  just winging it.  You've got this horrendous show  called The Radio Chick  that's starting up again 
[00:15:30]  in the afternoon.  Holy shit.  It's going to be so much fun  to watch this thing bomb.  in New York.  Dude, the show is...  Look, I'm not even  getting personal here.  I'm so beyond  getting personal  with anybody  from that program  because we work together  at NEW.  It was years ago.  There's nothing personal there.  Hold on.  The fact is,  they failed  like twice  in New York City.  And there they are.  Yeah. 
[00:16:00]  Fucking Infinity.  Got a job again.  Fucking Infinity  will be calling us  in six months.  I guarantee it.  Here is a guarantee.  I guarantee it.  Bob Eatman.  Oh, you're going to have to  pay three or nine, buddy.  Hi, guys.  It's Bob.  Got a phone call.  Joel Hollander.  Seems Infinity  is very interested  in you guys.  Yeah.  Well, we work here at XM.  Thank you.  Godspeed.  Godspeed to your free FM.  Let's go to AJ in New Jersey.  Oh, I encourage 
[00:16:30]  all our listeners  to go listen to David Lee Roth.  You know, we don't give a fuck.  We're on all day  on this channel  for the most part.  So you come back  and listen to the replay.  You have to listen to it  to hear how awful it is.  How are you guys  not mentioning  the David Hinckley article  at all?  Why?  How does he not mention you guys?  He hates us.  He's just a fucking...  I want to smash his glasses.  I like doddering old fool.  But to not recognize  the fact that you guys  are here and how ironic  it is that you're not  on this format  that you just described  which is awful  and Howard's not on it  and you're not on it.  It's fucking...  Yeah, if they were 
[00:17:00]  going to go for this  big talk switch,  if this was the big thing  to do,  it should have been done  years ago  where Howard was  doing mornings,  we were doing afternoons,  you fill up the middays,  and that would have been  a successful talk thing  because we were both  two proven programs  as far as talk radio goes.  Absolutely.  There's nothing...  No one can argue that.  It's not like,  oh, dude, I hate you.  Well, that's fine.  It's proven  that we were successful,  Howard's successful. 
[00:17:30]  That would have been  the talk format to do.  They waited  until all of their  talk properties  were gone from infinity.  Any of their talk properties  that were as successful  are gone now  and now they decide  to go with,  hey, this is an idea.  Let's make a talk format.  Now that we've lost  Howard and Opie and Anthony...  Yeah, that caters  to men 18 of 49.  You know,  the shows that were  proven success  in syndication  around the country,  yeah.  Now that they're gone,  let's try with some shows 
[00:18:00]  that have failed twice  in New York.  Unproven people.  People that have never  hosted radio programs.  Yeah, let's give that a whirl.  I thought Joel Hollander  was smarter than this.  I really did.  I think his hands are tied, dude.  We've hung with him  a bunch of times.  He is.  I have to say  his hands are fucking tied.  I have to.  Over his head, you think?  You've got to start thinking  he's a dummy, too.  Yeah, over his head.  These people,  I think his hands are tied.  I think he absolutely,  based on little tidbits 
[00:18:30]  of conversation  and the speculation  I've heard  from very reliable sources,  there was phone calls made  and things were said  and it just didn't work out.  So follow us.  So Infinity Broadcast  is doing a talk show  for men,  but you can't do it  in the way  that it's supposed to be done.  No.  Hence, we're at XM  and other shows  coming to XM, right?  Right.  And now, besides that,  they've taken away  the Alternative Rock station  in New York.  Yeah.  No one's playing  Alternative Rock now 
[00:19:00]  in New York City.  No.  Someone will snatch that up  and go with that.  So all those people  that were listening to K-Rock  because of the Alternative Rock,  they're going to be looking  for an alternative.  So those people  are going to be pushed  towards satellite radio as well.  Right.  Amazing.  Thank you.  Yeah, why not?  Play right into our hands again.  AJ from New Jersey.  What's up?  Morning, boys.  How are you?  Jimmy, happy birthday.  Hi.  Not for nothing.  I just put it on  for about half a second.  The guy's talking  about surfing.  It's January in New York. 
[00:19:30]  They don't understand,  Bobby.  Please explain to me.  Dude, because he's  freeform, man.  It's all about  just winging it.  Dude, anybody can  wing it on the radio  for two weeks.  Anybody.  You have enough stories  in you to wing it.  But after that,  you don't realize  how hard you got  to work at this.  You can put enough  rhymes together.  Yeah.  That's all you need to do.  Yeah.  That's all he does.  Let's go to Frankie 
[00:20:00]  in Staten Island.  Frankie, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey, man.  I was listening  to him this morning.  He's so far  all over the fucking place,  it's not even funny.  One minute he's talking  about Ground Zero  and how instead  of rebuilding it,  they should put  Schools for the Arts  and Shelters  up over there.  Oh, no, no, no.  He also said,  sorry to interrupt you  there, Frankie,  he also said  he wants to make  Ground Zero  into Off, Off,  Off Broadway.  Well, somebody should  get him Off, Off,  Off the fucking radio.  That's very funny, sir. 
[00:20:30]  Did he really say  that Off, Off,  Off Broadway?  Oh, yeah,  because he's just  winging it, man.  He's just winging it.  We want shows down there.  Woo!  It'd be great.  This is what he said  about Ground Zero.  He's like,  hey, that Vietnam Memorial,  that was a good thing  they did up there.  Up there.  Up there.  It would be technically  down there  because you're in New York.  Ah, you ass.  You trip up.  We all trip up.  And then he's like,  yeah, maybe instead  of putting another building up  where people just go  to work and commerce  and stuff, 
[00:21:00]  why don't we...  Hey, I almost sound  like David the Rock.  Hey, man,  do it all right.  You did,  and I want to hear  your point.  Why don't we turn it  into Off, Off Broadway?  Ah, smoke another dupe,  my friend.  What is that going to do?  Broadway's tanking.  We're having a hard  enough time.  Right.  Let's go to Jason  in Michigan.  Take prime business  real estate  and fill it with  fucking oxy-fartsy people.  Give it to a bunch  of fags.  Go for it.  Yeah, I did.  Okay, fags.  Jason, what's up? 
[00:21:30]  Hey, how you doing?  What's up, little Jimmy?  Hey.  Hello?  Yeah, that's your turn, Jason.  Oh, hey, you guys  are getting trashed  in Michigan  by Howard's replacement.  Rovers in the morning.  What is Rovers saying?  An ONA fan  called in about  6.30 this morning  and said,  hey, I'm going to  give you guys a chance.  And he's like,  well, you don't want to pay  for it.  If you want to pay  for that crap  listening to ONA,  you go ahead and do it.  Maybe I should start  charging hoo-hoo.  That's too bad.  Another phony.  We've hung out  with Rovers many times.  Now he's going to  play that role. 
[00:22:00]  Don't worry about Rovers.  Now he's going to  play the role  where we're not creative  and we're not talented.  Like he wasn't  kissing our ass  every time we went  to Cleveland.  Rovers, stop.  I wouldn't worry  about Rovers too much.  Stop, Rovers.  You weren't hanging out  in a hotel suite party  with Jimmy and I  kissing our ass  all night, right?  That didn't happen.  You weren't hanging out  in the VIP area  of a strip club  just saying how great  the show was and stuff.  Stop.  What is he out of?  Stop with your nonsense.  Thanks, Jason. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, punch it out.  All right.  Randy in D.C.,  what's up?  What's up,  boys?  Brucey, is that you?  Boys, I just want to know  this satellite radio  is a flash in the pan, boys.  It's what they call  a fad,  like the hula hoop  and rock and roll.  I'm going to be  starting a rock station  in the suburbs  of Worcester  and I want you  to be the showcase show,  boys.  Which will be my anchors,  boys.  Oh, I know you're  making a lot of money now, 
[00:23:00]  but for how long?  I could pay you  $30,000 apiece, boys.  Boys, there are things  called meteoroids  that can strike a satellite  and end your careers  at any moment.  I'm there to  bail you out, boys.  I'm like a  protective space station  you can go to  if there's problems  up in the stratosphere.  What a tool.  I love Bruce, you know.  I'll also be  your program director,  b-b-boys.  B-b-b-b-b-boys.  Make sure you tape  every show  and bring it into my office 
[00:23:30]  so we can have  an air check session.  I have no experience  in air checking  air personalities,  but I'll give it a whack  with you guys.  Let's go through this.  Hey, it's the  Opie and Anthony show.  The way you said  Opie and Anthony,  I believe you should  have enunciated  a bit more on the  shut up.  You know nothing  about what's  entertaining on the air.  B-b-b-boys,  you know it's  W-A-N-B-C.  Now, this is key.  Do it like Mr. Imus.  He uses cactus. 
[00:24:00]  In the rest of the country,  Randy is imitating  our old boss  who claims that he  b-b-b-boys.  who claims that he  discovered Opie and Anthony.  I discovered them.  One was a soda jerk  down at the drugstore.  The other one  was an usher  at the movie house.  B-b-b-boys.  Wow.  That's very good,  actually.  I had a box of cassettes,  boys, and I listened  to all of them  in my giant Escalade.  No, he didn't even have  it.  He had like a suburban.  He was there before 
[00:24:30]  SUVs really took off.  Oh, yeah, right,  I guess.  It wasn't an Escalade.  So, he was so short,  so diminutive,  that he decided  he needed the biggest  vehicle that was ever  made, ever, ever,  ever at the time.  And he would drive  around in that  to look bigger.  But him getting in  and out of this vehicle  was a scream to watch.  We used to joke  that he'd flip a rope  ladder out  so he could climb up.  He's a little fidget  in a giant suburban.  Yeah.  Which was just him  driving his penis. 
[00:25:00]  His him,  penis down the mass pike.  And he claimed that  he listened to our cassette  that I sent up  from our BAB days.  And then he was the one  that discovered us.  These boys,  I'm going to make you stars.  He forgot that  it was Ron Valeri.  It was Ron Valeri.  He forgot that  when we really tried  to spread our wings,  as it were,  he came running in  saying,  Boys, what the fuck  is this,  a talk show now?  Play the fucking music.  That's right.  He did say that.  Like, we used to have 
[00:25:30]  to play like 12 songs  an hour or some shit  and we were chipping it down.  10, 8 songs an hour.  Six.  And we're just talking  more and more.  And our ratings are going up  and people are digging the show.  But we did go back  to music every so often.  So we're doing a break  and after we get done  with the break,  he'd come in,  what the fuck is this,  a talk show, boys?  Back to the music.  Yeah, that's really  using us to the best  of our abilities, Brucey.  Way to have a vision.  Yeah, way to have a vision.  I discovered them. 
[00:26:00]  They could play records.  You discovered us.  But you know something?  I still love that motherfucker.  Of course.  We were right in front  of his face showing  that we had some talk show  chops to ourselves.  Yeah.  And he's in there  telling us to shut up.  But he has no problem  telling everyone  that he discovered us.  I discovered the talk show.  Even though he did it.  Let me hear the Ovi and Anthony.  That was me.  Unbelievable.  Sorry, Brent,  are you still there?  Yes.  And believe me,  if Bruce walked in here 
[00:26:30]  right now,  I'd give the bastard a hug.  I love the guy.  It's tough to hug him, though.  You've got to get on your knees.  Yeah.  It's like a little cousin  coming over.  Oh, how you doing?  You pinch him on the ass.  All right.  So what do you got there,  Randy?  Well, boys,  I have a quick question.  How the hell  do you pick David Lee Roth  out of all the people  to be looking for the radio show?  Did you pick him, Ovi?  I didn't know that.  It's unbelievable, actually.  There's Dice out there.  There's so many people.  No, see, 
[00:27:00]  Dice can't do a radio show either.  Do you understand?  All day long.  These guys in entertainment,  they don't work hard.  They really don't work hard.  You know,  I give credit to anyone  that has a successful radio show  because it takes a lot  of fucking work.  It's a pain in the ass.  It is a pain in the ass  to do this on a daily basis.  Yeah.  Because a lot of people  are saying we had  a really good show yesterday.  Yesterday's show  doesn't mean shit.  We got to entertain again today  with four hours  of original material.  Do it again.  Do it again.  And when you hire a guy  to just wing it, man, 
[00:27:30]  that's good for two,  three weeks, tops.  Yep.  After that,  he's going to run out of stories.  He's just going to start  making up shit.  He'll probably claim  he's gay or something  because that'll give him  another week of radio.  Again, ripping Jimmy off.  Wait, I never claimed this.  I just made a few mistakes  that were financially  not very feasible.  So, you know,  they're playing right  into the satellite radio  hands that we have here.  So, Godspeed.  You guys rock.  Thank you.  All right. 
[00:28:00]  See you later,  bu-bu-boys.  All right.  This guy's got a problem  with me that he thought  I thought you liked  the radio chick.  No, it's not a matter.  I try to say 30 times  that it's nothing personal.  I have no personal vendetta  against certain people  on the radio,  certain people I do.  The whole radio chick show,  I have nothing personal  against them.  They never did anything  to me to, you know,  hurt me or anything.  I just,  their show did not succeed  in New York City. 
[00:28:30]  Twice.  It just didn't work out.  If it did,  they would have, you know,  been where they were.  Sorry.  It's just the way it is.  Them doing afternoon drive  over there,  it seems to be  another weird move  from Infinity.  You know,  get a show that works.  Yes,  it was amazing  that they hired her.  Absolutely amazing.  I know.  That's all I'm saying.  I don't have a problem.  We'll be proving right,  by the way.  It'll be a disaster  across the board, 
[00:29:00]  that station.  Let's go to Chris in D.C.  Chris, what's up?  Yo, boys.  Every time I flip over,  I'm getting commercials.  I can't even find  David Leveroff.  Well,  but it's free.  It's free.  It's free, man.  Yeah, yeah.  It's free, man.  More free FM  after 20 minutes  of commercials.  Let me tell you  about when we were  recording Running  with the Devil.  What?  Let me tell you.  Skinny-booty-doobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie-boobie 
[00:29:30]  Say that, because Jimmy will endorse that show.  I'd listen to Ozzy if he were on competing against us.  Of course you would.  Of course you would.  It'd be the Ozzy and Jimmy show. 
[00:30:00]  You'd leave.  All right, Chris.  Dreams.  All right, guys.  It's just, I don't know.  It's amazing.  You're trying to call yourself Free FM, and you're doing very long commercial stop sets.  That's not free.  That's people suffering.  People suffering.  Yeah, thanks.  All right.  Free.  Thanks for the freebie.  Ever notice everything free really sucks?  Yes.  Whenever people are handing out free stuff, whenever there's something free that's a giveaway, it stinks. 
[00:30:30]  I got a great example.  Go drink a fine glass of free water.  Free water.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Get some out of the old tap right now.  Go ahead.  Take a big whiff of that glass first and gulp it down.  Enjoy your free water, because I was against the bottle water craze.  Of course.  Certainly.  And I would tap all the time.  Yeah.  You can't tap anymore.  No tap.  Go online.  No tap.  Go online. 
[00:31:00]  Look for girls.  Go try to find your own girl.  Then look in the escort side and see exactly what works out for you.  Free blowjob from the fat girl, or do you want the hot 10 for a couple hundred bucks?  Mm-hmm.  Free, free, free.  Free stinks.  Everything free stinks.  Keep saying free.  I'm sorry.  We'll run commercials for free FM.  We don't give a shit.  We'll run commercials about how radio should be free.  We don't give a shit.  Shit.  Free dee be dee bop.  You know.  Right after 20 minutes of commercials, I'll be winging it some more. 
[00:31:30]  Let me tell you about the time we were playing in Cleveland, man.  All right.  No.  All right.  We don't care.  Oh, great.  It's not 1984.  Great.  Stop it.  Stop it.  How many cities were on that tour?  So, all right.  You can talk about every city.  All right.  He's got everyone.  Seattle, man.  We had some chicks back in the dressing room.  A boosie boosie boosie boosie boosie boosie boosie boosie.  Ah, shit.  It's the quotes in the paper today because they did a big article on them. 
[00:32:00]  Yes, they did.  It's a big move, kids.  You think Infinity's jerking off because we're giving them all this attention today?  Let them get a little attention.  It's their big day.  Come on.  Let's see.  Where's this unbelievable quote?  Ask Roth, for instance, about simply physically getting up to do a morning radio show.  Roth says, you call it morning, he says?  I call it after hours.  I haven't been to sleep since 1988 anyway. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, rocking, man.  No, you're not.  And David Hinckley asks, and what made him go to sleep then?  And David Lee Roth replies, Darcy from Dallas.  My background is utterly different from everyone else on the radio, he says.  The average host has spent the last 30 years talking into a microphone in a room without  a window.  My life for the last 30 years has been international adventure and intrigue. 
[00:33:00]  Adventurer?  What is he, big game hunting?  Marching along, we're adventurers.  What the fuck is he?  Adventurer?  Intrigue?  What is this thing growing on my cock?  Man, I've been an international spy.  No, you haven't.  No, you haven't.  You're a washed up rock star.  You were fortunate to see the Great Wall of China.  Congratulations.  There you go.  Describe that on the radio for an hour. 
[00:33:30]  Have fun.  David Hinckley.  Here.  Thanks.  Tom in New Jersey.  Tom?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, yeah, I'm putting back to good old David Lee Roth.  And for one thing, he refers to Tom Chiasano as Tom Chiasano, which is kind of funny.  Wait, wait, is it?  How did he say it, though?  Chiasano.  What's it supposed to be?  Chiasano.  Oh, so it's like he makes it Chiasano because it's supposed to be Chiasano.  Correct.  And then pauses while everyone laughs. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, right.  Everyone laughs.  And then the other thing was talking about going on tour, like every four weeks, I guess.  He's still with the band and then coming back, and Tom Chiasano doesn't approve because  he wants to keep them in their little box for, you know, the entire time or whatever.  But talking about some kind of tour or something.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, it makes no fucking sense.  Can I point out that it's very rare that you get on The Boss the first day?  There's no real angst at The Boss the first day at work.  Right.  There's no real conflict the first day at work.  Right.  You cannot even fake it. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  I don't know if it was like a Freudian slip.  Oh, yeah, Tom Chiasano.  Oops.  You know, kind of thing.  It was like, what the fuck?  No.  The best day is going to be, we'll come to work one morning and discover that David  Lee Roth just walked away.  Just disappeared.  He just walked away.  There's someone else in there.  They're going all music.  Realizes that it was too hard to do, and he doesn't need the bullshit with the, you know,  with the...  Push down, boys.  Waking up.  With all the bigwigs, you know, yelling and screaming at him behind closed doors trying  to shape a radio show. 
[00:35:00]  He's just going to walk away.  Keep up your good nature.  Let's go to Crispy.  Crispy, what's up?  Hey, guys.  From back in WNAW, you guys, you kind of...  First time I heard what you guys were doing, like, there was never a talk show doing, like,  the whole garage radio thing like you started.  And you were...  The chick was before you guys.  So you guys were always, like, doing...  Winging it, but you did it right.  But she would always crescendo to a fake laugh in between the break.  Oh, a lot of radio guys try to do that. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, yeah, that's old school.  It was gross.  It's called...  And they goofed on it on a Steinfeld episode.  It's called Leaving on a High Note.  You know, like, if you get a big laugh, you hit the button and go right into the commercial.  Pew, pew, pew.  The radio chick.  You know?  Yeah, you would know when the commercial's coming.  It was gross.  Yeah.  It's like...  And then, you know, he stepped on the duck.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Pew, pew, pew.  The radio chick.  Like, it's got to end on a laugh, a high note. 
[00:36:00]  We don't care if it ends with, Derek, where the fuck did you go?  Press the button, idiot.  You know, something like that.  That, to me, is a good way to get out.  Here's a typical break.  What'd you say, Jim?  All right.  Be right back.  Why does it have to be so polished when it could be a rusted hulk?  This show really is expensive, Drek.  Dribble.  Unprofessional crap.  Fucking bunch of incompetence.  How do we bamboozle people so often? 
[00:36:30]  And they're paying for it now.  You should have to pay for radio.  Right.  Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, we should cut our own free stinks.  Yeah, why don't we fight back?  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Free stinks.  Would you take a free cup of coffee over some Starbucks?  No.  You know what that would free coffee would taste like?  Oh, I need coffee, actually.  Would you take some free HIV over medicine?  No. 
[00:37:00]  No.  Mm-mm.  Free, the way the Jews want you to be.  Jesus, Jim.  I don't think we were going there.  I'm just saying that could be an ad point.  Okay.  Maybe we'll mull that over.  You know, free radio if you want your daughter bedding down with Negroes.  Oh.  All right.  Write that one down.  I'll voice that one.  We're Steve.  Steve's our guy.  Steve.  We want some free FM battle ads. 
[00:37:30]  That's right.  This is the beauty of us.  We come up with these dumb ideas, and then we pass it on to someone else so we can get  out of here at 11-01.  Right.  That's right.  Because we work so hard at our radio show.  Jim, he's absolutely right, though.  The free FM.  Steven, how are you?  Hi, Anthony.  I have to thank Steve for helping me this morning.  Oh, we haven't even got to why you're pissed off.  There was a countdown going.  Oh, yeah.  There was a countdown going that Steve was, it was like a lethal weapon movie where he  had to, they're calling Steve on his phone in the office.  I'm ready for it now. 
[00:38:00]  I reached into the pocket, got it as it started ringing.  As it was ringing.  Fuckers.  It was like snipping the correct wire in time, or else there would have been disaster.  It was countdown to Anthony's flip out.  I informed Steve in a civil tone.  No, you didn't.  That if by the time the show was on the air, if this camera software hadn't been installed  and running on this laptop behind this little TV monitor, that the first break of the show 
[00:38:30]  would be me smashing the shit out of that laptop.  I would have taken it and just smashed the shit out of it.  Repeat that entire sentence, but fuck was every other word.  Okay.  Yeah.  I may have embellished it with a few F words.  As you have said, I was so pissed off because the pal talk thing has taken off.  Everyone seems to enjoy it.  The room packs out at night.  For some reason, there were about 200 people last night at about midnight staring at this 
[00:39:00]  empty studio.  He was dumbfounded.  How many people?  Dude, 200 people.  Was there music playing?  Nothing.  Did anybody come in?  I saw someone, because I kept checking in every so often, I saw someone walk past the  door there.  Maybe that was the ghost.  That's creepy.  Don't fucking creep me out.  Yeah.  There's a ghost.  It looked like a chick, though.  It looked like a chick.  Yeah, that's a ghost. 
[00:39:30]  Could that have been?  It's a ghost.  Yeah?  Is there a ghost in the building?  Oh, yeah, there is.  Look for the ghost.  Look for the ghost.  The studio is haunted.  If you look at the cameras late at night, you'll see eerie figures walking past the windows.  Mwah.  Bozy, bozy, bozy, bo.  I don't like ghosts.  They scare me.  Come sleep with me. 
[00:40:00]  There's a ghost with a big head shaking, putting its nose on an album and running back down.  Very creepy.  Yeah, but there are people watching, so they dig this thing, and I wanted to switch the  cameras around, so we have the one that was in the office in here, and the one in here  in the office.  Switch them, because the one in the office was better, and I see having a better camera  in the studio.  Right.  So that way we can zoom in on the likes of like Steve.  See, look.  There it is.  Look at Steve.  Oh, wow.  See? 
[00:40:30]  Oh, wow.  That's a powerful zoom.  And Jimmy and everybody.  And then we zoom out.  We can see Opie now.  It's just what I figured would be better.  Sure.  In order to install software on this computer, it was a nightmare.  Just a nightmare.  Something that normally, in your home, with minimal computer experience, would take you  five minutes.  Sure.  Was just about an hour.  I put that on my computer in five minutes.  That same camera I did.  It's easy.  Anybody could.  Down syndrome.  Well. 
[00:41:00]  Big tongue, five minutes.  Okay, maybe eight.  But in here, it's just nothing works like the real world at XM.  Everything is like the movies.  It's all got to be ultra high tech, where you can't just log in and.  Very high security.  Make something work.  Yeah, very high security.  So Steve bailed me out.  And Steve, thank you.  No problem.  Because I was livid.  Yeah, you were a little bit upset.  What did you have to do for it?  I just had to.  No one cares.  There was too many passwords.  It's a secret anyway. 
[00:41:30]  Hey, so we wanted to make these, you know, these free things.  Free socks.  Yeah.  Can I request that Jimmy voice the one about the daughter's bedding down with Nico?  I have a couple of ideas I'd like to help with.  I'd like to be a part of this, not a part of it.  I'd love it if you were.  I'd like to use the 40s guy voice for one.  All right.  And perhaps something can come into play there.  Okay.  About free FM and how it's almost like communism.  I'd like to use my.  That's right.  I like that.  I like that direction.  I would like to use my typing guy.  Oh.  Wow. 
[00:42:00]  Okay.  I like that.  I like things to be free.  Why do I have to pay?  You're going to do the typing hand.  Yes.  Why am I paying for something I could get for free?  Typing guy.  He's got a name.  It's a character.  I got a few characters.  Yeah.  I don't know.  They pop up every once in a while.  JC in New Jersey.  Yeah.  And off with the table you lost up. 
[00:42:30]  What about this fucking girl with the daddy's little girl?  Oh, that was yesterday at the end of the show.  You really haven't figured it out yet?  Someone fucked it up.  All right.  We'll have to play it again here first, and then we'll explain further.  How's that, JC?  That was great.  This was kind of a cliffhanger yesterday.  Cliffhanger.  We're on the own.  And by the way, because people are confused, we took some audio that we found, and then  Steve went into production to help us out, because we thought it would be great if we  added daddy's little girl to this rant. 
[00:43:00]  This little montage.  Yeah.  So, this is what we played late yesterday.  Spiritual, sexual.  You're the end of the rainbow.  My breasts.  My pot of gold.  My white shining legs.  My vagina.  Your daddy's little girl.  My ass are all godly.  You have and move.  God.  God, in my tits.  A precious gem. 
[00:43:30]  My tits inside, God.  Is what you are.  My tits are godly.  Your mommy's bright.  My tits are god.  And shining star.  Spiritual.  Spiritual, sexual.  You're the spirit of Christmas.  Immediately noticed by tits.  My star on the tree.  T-I-T.  For the Easter bunny. 
[00:44:00]  Papa, don't preach.  To mommy and me.  I've been troubled deep.  Your sugar, your spice.  Papa, don't preach.  You're everything.  I've been losing sleep.  And your daddy.  God, in my tits.  My tits inside, God.  My tits are godly.  My tits are god. 
[00:44:30]  Holy shit.  That's wonderful.  Oh, dear Lord.  Oh, dear Lord.  That is from some Jewish theater group?  I guess.  Is that what, uh...  That's Howard Stern's daughter, Emily.  That is little Emily Stern.  Howie's little girl.  All growed up in college.  With some, uh, big titties.  Uh, half naked.  Dressed like a Madonna. 
[00:45:00]  Kind of with cones on her tits.  Wearing a little bikini bottom.  Was she doing a Madonna impression?  It's supposed to be this play about, uh, the Kabbalah.  And, uh, there's people, you know, it's an ensemble cast.  So different people with their little comedic takes on the Kabbalah.  And then her part is playing this Madonna-esque character who is really into Kabbalah.  But, you know, talking about her tits and her ass and her vagina, uh, as being godly. 
[00:45:30]  Is it sarcastic?  I think so.  Yeah.  I think it's supposed to be sarcastic.  It's a comedy.  Okay.  Um, it's not a laugh to be had, though.  But, yeah.  It's not a laugh to be had.  But hoo-hoo, she's outrageous, huh?  I gotta have her on the show.  Get naked.  Hoo-hoo.  Talking about...  What happened in your life, honey, with your father?  What did he do that got you?  Oh, shit, it was me.  That's right.  That's right, honey. 
[00:46:00]  Didn't he always ask that question?  What happened in your upbringing?  When did your daddy leave you?  Oh, that's right.  I remember.  That's right.  I didn't have time for you.  Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  Mama!  Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  Allison, what did you do to her?  Wow.  Yeah, that's what she's doing now.  I hear there's even more nudity, though, in that.  Is there? 
[00:46:30]  More than that.  Yeah.  Gotta get some video of her titties.  She really shouldn't.  She doesn't.  You know what?  She shouldn't get new, though, man.  She looks sloppy, but okay.  Sort of like a Courtney Love thing, maybe.  Are you getting that at all?  Like a little skank in her?  I like a little skank, bro.  You like a little skank sometimes?  No.  She's like a little sloppy and loose.  No, she's really ugly, to be honest with you. 
[00:47:00]  She's not a pretty girl.  You wouldn't throw her one for just the star factor?  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Dude, just so you're like, I'm fucking banging Stern's daughter, that's gotta have some fucking  equity in it somewhere.  Absolutely not.  Not that different.  No?  Nope.  I'm not talking about desperation.  Nope.  I'm talking about a, you know, what a better way.  Nope.  Nothing there.  No, huh?  Nope.  Grab those big titties. 
[00:47:30]  No.  Nothing, huh?  No.  Jimmy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, of course Jimmy would.  I know.  Jimmy would lick her ass.  That's not her, is that her real hair?  Was that a wig?  I have no idea.  Long hair.  Could be a wig.  I'd like to see other shots, but, uh, let's see this body.  Why not?  I think that not even, not even based on what she looks like.  Not even based on what she looks like.  Just the fact that you'd be tooling her, tooling Stern's daughter. 
[00:48:00]  No.  That's right.  Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.  Who's that tall drink of water with her?  Wow.  He's an attractive one.  Smashes perfect teeth.  All right.  Flea's mom.  Who the hell's Flea's mom?  Flea's mom.  What's up?  Hi.  This is Flea's mom.  I was calling first to let you know I'm a huge fan since NEW days. 
[00:48:30]  Which Flea are you talking about, madam?  Uh, the one who actually sat behind Eric last night in wrestling.  Okay.  Um, and I have to tell you what a bad influence Jim is on my life.  Wait.  First of all, uh, how did you know that, uh, your son was sitting next to Eric there?  Because he called me last night when he left the arena and said, you're not going to believe  who I sat behind in wrestling last night.  Oh, boy.  What's why? 
[00:49:00]  That's a bad thing.  He was excited that he was sitting next to E-Rock?  E-Rock.  Our own E-Rock?  E-Rock.  Oh, a little star sighting.  E-Rock was sighted at the wrestling event?  I didn't say he was excited.  How was Raw, by the way?  Good.  I liked it.  I know you don't.  Of course you do.  Guys aren't into it anymore, but I liked it.  Who won the match?  I don't know.  We understand how much you like it by how much time you spend on the wrestling sites  during time you're supposed to be working.  Ooh.  As per everybody in that room that's laughing hysterically right now. 
[00:49:30]  Ooh.  Yes.  Anyways, I have a quick Norton story to tell you.  I was with some relatives recently that I only see maybe once a year, and they were  talking about this driving maneuver and how they wouldn't do it.  And I said, not only would I do it, but I'd run over a pregnant lady pushing a baby carriage.  Nice.  And then I said to myself, oh my God, I sound like Jim Norton.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Anyway, I was calling because I need a date.  By the way, you only sound like me if you say that and then notice you have an erection.  Oh, that would be a little bit hard. 
[00:50:00]  How about if my nipples were erect?  Would that count?  Yeah.  How old are you?  How old abroad are you?  52.  I like this.  52.  Nice.  And please, Dad and I are getting divorced.  Good.  And I can't find...  Why are you getting a divorce?  Does it matter?  Yeah.  Yes, of course.  Makes conversation.  Just, you know, we've changed over the years and gone different ways, and it's, you know...  You're going to be out on the prowl at 52? 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, I know.  It sucks.  And I can't...  An old turkey like you on the prowl.  Old chicken makes the best soup.  Are you a pretty gal?  Remember that?  Yeah.  I actually met you.  I met you a few times, Jim.  I met you at the cellar one night.  Lick your ass?  Did he lick my ass?  Yeah.  He's still a little too young for me.  Wait, wait, wait.  What do you look like?  Not to be creepy or nothing or hit on a flea's mom, but I'm just kind of curious.  What do I look like?  I don't know.  Brown hair? 
[00:51:00]  It could be anything.  Celebrity.  Pick a celebrity.  Yes.  Pick a celebrity.  A younger...  Jesus.  Come on, Jon Favreau.  They used to tell me I look like Diana Riggs.  Diana what?  Diana Riggs.  Diana Riggs from the Avengers?  Yeah.  Wow.  But older, right?  No, I think she's about my age.  Yeah, well, now, but no one's seen her in 50 years.  Well...  The woman was very hot back in the Avenger days.  Aunt, you're jumping to conclusions. 
[00:51:30]  I'm going to work, please, Mom.  You're working her?  Yes, I'm going to work you, miss.  Okay, I'm looking for a date.  I'm looking for a man around my age who likes stand-up comedy, who likes, you know, who listens  still to...  Colin Quinn.  ...eval music.  No.  You mind a guy who's on the down side, career-wise?  Because I'm sure Colin is, you know, a little more humble now than he was when Tough Crowd  was on.  You know...  I love Tough Crowd. 
[00:52:00]  I have actually a bumping stick with that.  That's wonderful.  All right, all right, all right.  When are you going to get divorced?  Nixon's the one.  Pardon me?  When am I...  Yeah.  Not soon enough.  Not soon enough.  So you're going to start dating before the divorce?  Are you guys still living in the same house?  No, we're separated.  You're going to go to Parents Without Partners?  No, I'd kill myself first.  No.  Pick up a man at Parents Without Partners.  Yeah, no, I'm not sure.  I'd love to meet a widow.  I don't want someone...  Meet a widow? 
[00:52:30]  What?  Yeah.  Why?  Because I don't want someone thrown away.  You know he's...  Oh, you said you don't want to meet a widow?  No, I do.  Why?  You know that that person is always going to be fixated on the person that died?  Yeah, but I don't want someone who's been thrown away and dumped.  Who's probably someone's leftover loser.  That's you.  You're getting a fucking divorce, lady.  What do you think you are?  That's why I want to never lose it.  You're someone's trash.  You're out by the curb, waiting for the truck. 
[00:53:00]  Well, thank you so much.  Well, I'm just trying to be realistic.  And there's Emma Peel.  Emma, that's right.  Very nice, attractive English woman of the 60s.  Absolutely.  She almost has a Norton's fantasy woman, Helen, look to her.  Little Helen in the face.  Little Helen in the face.  Helen had a very dignified bouffant that was frosted.  Oh, okay.  Actually, you know what?  You can ask.  Paul's been to my house.  Paul Fields.  Of course he has. 
[00:53:30]  Why was no filter Paul at your house?  Because we actually taped the salt on the media.  And he came to my house with his DVD burner to burn it.  I don't know.  Was he just knocking on doors and decided?  Her son's a big fan of the show.  Yeah, and I even made him a hand and cheese sandwich.  Yeah, good strategy whenever Paul comes over.  Give something that he'll put in his mouth to keep him quiet for two fucking seconds. 
[00:54:00]  How come they always want to ban Flea from the message boards?  I don't know.  He's such a nice boy.  So we've been talking to you for about 20 minutes and there's no takers whatsoever.  None.  Well, okay.  Sorry, Flea's mom.  Well, how are we going to get this done?  I don't know.  Well, right to Flea in town.  I don't know.  You want my email address off the air?  You sound like you have a good personality.  I do.  I'm a lot of fun.  I'm really nice.  I'm young at heart. 
[00:54:30]  I don't know what else to say.  I'm not bad looking.  I'm not fat.  I wear a size 10.  I'm in good shape.  I work out three, four times a week.  Do you suck a mean dick?  I have a good job.  That is important.  It's a pertinent question.  She wears a size 4.  That's nice, right?  Not a size 10, not a 4.  Wow.  Size 14.  Jesus.  Size 10.  Isn't that on the high side?  I don't know dress sizes.  Would you?  10 would be a little bit on the high side.  But I do know there's a size 1.  So 10 is going to be up there. 
[00:55:00]  Are you big through the hips?  Roomie?  Roomie.  Am I roomie?  I'm good for holding.  Oh, boy.  How tall are you?  Out a window.  Almost 5'6".  5'6".  Well, almost 5'6".  That's 5'5".  5'5".  How much do you weigh?  I weigh about 150 pounds.  Don't lie.  Come on.  How much?  I'm not lying.  You're taking 10 pounds off at least.  No, I'm not.  That's what women do when they ask on the phone.  They take 5 pounds off 10 pounds.  That's right.  I didn't shave any of my age either.  I'm telling you my real age.  Men, when we're talking online, we add like maybe 11 or 12 inches to our height and you 
[00:55:30]  wind up taking off 10 pounds.  That's what you do.  How about we play Guess What's in Your Pants?  Oh.  I can't.  I've got to go to work.  For two minutes.  No, I can't.  Guys will love it.  It's going to be quick because you don't even have to rub.  We know.  We just know.  I'm not telling.  She's got Frederick Douglass' head.  It's time to play. 
[00:56:00]  No, it's not.  No, it's not.  Yeah, exactly.  Big gray just messed up.  Derek, stop the song.  We don't need it.  I'm going to work, guys.  You go to work.  What do you do?  What do you do?  What do you do for a living?  I guess you'd call me.  I'm not really a secretary.  I work in an office, but I'm the only one there, so I do everything.  Yeah, it makes perfect sense.  All right.  All right.  All right.  If you get any tickets, let's Flea know.  We'll be in touch.  Thank you so much.  All right.  There's Flea's mom.  She's a lot of fun.  Anybody want somebody?  She's very cool.  52, 5'5", size 10. 
[00:56:30]  It's good.  She didn't answer the sucks-a-mean-caca question.  I hope he launched out there at her, but you can assume she doesn't.  I have no idea what this is.  Some O&A dedication on a New Jersey radio station?  Ooh.  The Breeze?  The Breeze.  Sent in by a guy named Chris.  I have no idea what this is.  Just throw it in.  That's the type of show this is, Hallie.  Because we're winging it, man.  We're just winging it.  But look what's came to cross my transom, and I don't know what to do with it. 
[00:57:00]  Bozy, bozy, put it in the machine.  Bozy, bozy, bop.  City bop.  Have fun with your free FM.  Diamond Dave.  Fucking idiots.  Last week, I got a call for an unusual song, and I looked it up, and I happened to find  it in a store that, unbelievable, this story is. 
[00:57:30]  Okay, so here it is.  I found the song.  It goes out to O&A Pess, and happy birthday to little Jimmy Norton.  Oh, my God.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Oh, and a puss. 
[00:58:00]  What radio show is playing this?  Free FM.  Free?  Yeah.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Oh, I'm sorry.  This is a David Lee Roth break.  Phenomenal.  That's a good one.  Whoever got that one through.  Yep. 
[00:58:30]  Going to do it all day.  No, it's not 11 o'clock yet.  What?  Let's see if she's going to talk again.  Leave her mic on?  That song stinks.  A six-year-old, she's going to love it.  I know.  I know.  This is Debra Stern, by the way. 
[00:59:00]  No?  No?  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  We get it.  Phenomenal.  Oh, my God.  We get it.  We get it.  The music you sing along to right here on The Breeze. 
[00:59:30]  Phenomenal.  Don't say I don't find them here.  I really thought that he was saying Phenomenal.  What's Phenomenal?  I don't know.  I have no idea.  I don't want to know.  That woman is horrible.  No, she's on The Breeze.  She's not horrible.  She's got a good little radio delivery.  Stop it.  For what she does?  Don't say I don't find them here.  What the heck should you get out there on free radio?  Free FM.  Free babbling idiots. 
[01:00:00]  But it's free.  But it's free.  When are we going to make our attack ads?  Oh, wow.  We're losing ground here.  Yeah, we sure are.  Look at the time.  I don't think by 11, I'll oof.  I got to go.  Can we get some cappuccinos today?  The boss wants cappuccino.  Chop, chop.  Come on.  I don't see anyone running anymore.  We need a new batch.  New batch.  New batch of runners. 
[01:00:30]  Who did we lose?  Did we lose Ray?  They're all like.  See, Ray's right here.  Ray's saunters.  We like the Ray.  Yeah.  Yeah, we can play that.  Ray's a good boy.  We'll play a little something on the break.  Ray, I would like a 2% cappuccino grande dry.  And using a Christmas gift, I would gather over there a Starbucks card.  It was a fine present that I got.  Everyone's got to walk around now with wallets that hurt your ass from all the gift cards and stuff. 
[01:01:00]  Because everyone just gave gift cards this year.  Yeah.  The thought is completely gone with Christmas.  What's up with the minors?  We're going to be all right in this situation?  Maybe we'll get into the 13 trap minors.  I don't think it looks good.  Seriously?  Yeah, it looks pretty bad.  All right.  We'll get into that and some other things next.  But first, this.  Because we want to end on a big laugh.  Yeah.  We'll play this.  Hopefully, there's a laugh in here.  And then we'll go to some kind of promo and commercial thing.  David Lee Roth is checking in, though.  David Lee Roth. 
[01:01:30]  Hello, skibbity-boob-boob.  Jesus, dude.  David Lee Greaseman.  Hello, skibbity-boobity-boobby.  What's going on, boys?  That is so bad, sir.  Wait, maybe he needs to do more.  That wasn't that bad.  Oh, you think he needs to do more?  Yeah, a little bit more.  Well, he might have to call back.  Oh, because we gave up my mash and burned.  We were playing a game called Cut Your Losses. 
[01:02:00]  Yes.  But you can imitate David Lee Roth today or our old boss, Brucey Mittman.  Let's say hi to Mary in Sacramento.  Mary, what's up?  Hi, everyone.  How are you?  I'm excellent.  Listen, I just wanted to tell you that I've been waiting and waiting and waiting to hear you guys again.  Yeah. 
[01:02:30]  I was forced to stop listening when the whole shit went down with, like, St. Patrick's Day or whatever.  Yeah.  And so this Christmas, I got excellent satellite radio, and, like, it was my favorite present.  And let me just say, my husband got me a two-carat diamond ring, and I'm just like, I have excellent satellite radio.  So, like, I just wanted to tell you guys that I've missed you so much, and I'm so overjoyed to be able to hear you again.  That's so frustrating.  I mean, we've been at this over a year, and our hardcore fans are still coming aboard.  Yeah, I know.  Well, like, I guess because they're trying to compete with the other guy and the other satellite radio, they've totally, like, dropped the prices. 
[01:03:00]  And so it's, like, so inexpensive to get right now.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  A lot of people got the XM for Christmas, and we couldn't be happier.  Yeah.  But you could be listening to radio for free.  Free M-M.  There's got to be a really cool station in Sacramento that's free.  There's not shit in Sacramento.  Of course not.  Commercial radio has done a horrendous job the last few years.  That's why satellite radio is going to rock.  Pushing everyone over here. 
[01:03:30]  I still pay for cable, so it's not like, you know what I mean?  Yeah.  All right.  I think they're just full crap.  So I love you guys, and I can't wait to hear you, like, all year.  Well, we're glad to have you back, Mary.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  Spread the word.  This is a virus.  You know that.  The ONA virus.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Diamond Dave wants to say hi to us today.  Diamond Dave.  These are awful David Lee Roth.  Are you singing Panama? 
[01:04:00]  That's great.  There, sir.  You know who does a pretty good, Dave?  Fucking Bob Kelly.  Bob Kelly?  Yeah.  Wow.  He's been with him enough at the cellar.  All right, Diamond Dave.  Wow.  Thank you.  Because what David...  Give me your name, Bob.  All right.  He's an...  I don't know him well.  He's a very nice guy, but he's really hard to talk to because he just fucking yaps,  and you're totally lost, and there's no room to jump in.  And then he'll just start laughing, so you kind of laugh because it's time. 
[01:04:30]  It's like babble, babble, babble.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then you're like, yeah, yeah, okay.  Well, he's one of those guys that just waits for his turn to talk.  He doesn't really listen to what you're saying.  No, no.  I'm sure he doesn't think of some rhyme that he can throw in there.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, uh...  Song lyric.  There are two shows on TV I can't get enough of.  By the way, did you see the Wizard of Oz thing?  I saw the second half of the goddamn thing.  Did we tape it?  I gotta see the beginning.  Yeah, it's been taped. 
[01:05:00]  There are sound clips from it.  All right, they're going through that?  Everything, yeah.  I mean...  All right, we'll go through that.  This is retarded people doing the Wizard of Oz.  The Wizard of Oz.  And they all played their parts and the whole big stage production,  all with retards playing the parts of the Wizard of Oz.  And there's a documentary on it on, like, Cinemax or something.  We have audio on that?  It is so funny.  It is so goddamn funny.  Hold on, I'm trying to find... 
[01:05:30]  What do you need, cupcakes?  I saw the end, though, like, the last half of it,  so they had already kind of trained them.  Because it's not really, like, learning a part or anything.  You just kind of train them to blurt words out.  Sounds.  How do you teach them, like, if they get the line wrong,  you put their dumb hand in a waffle iron and close it?  That could work.  Until they say it right?  I told you about the Tin Man.  They had a Tin Man who was in a wheelchair.  He was a black guy in a wheelchair with Coke bottle glasses. 
[01:06:00]  They painted him silver, but you could still see, because he's black.  It's hard to paint silver over blackface.  Sorry.  It's not racist.  It's just the way it is.  Hard to paint a black guy silver.  And they put a little, you know, funnel on his head and gave him an axe.  By the way, good thing to hand a retard.  Yeah.  Like an axe.  He's sitting in a wheelchair.  Now, he's in a wheelchair.  So, what they did was they had somebody push him around the stage, 
[01:06:30]  and they didn't want to be obvious that someone's pushing him,  so the person was dressed as a tree.  So, there's a tree pushing a black silver guy in a wheelchair,  and that's your Tin Man.  I got to see the beginning, though,  on how they actually pick the people for each part.  Well, apparently, it was whoever could fucking talk without just collapsing,  because if the guy in the wheelchair and the Coke bottle glasses got the Tin Man gig,  there probably was not a lot of people he had to beat out.  They did do, from what I could see, 
[01:07:00]  they did do little things that would seem inappropriate.  Like, there weren't any Down syndrome people in the lead roles,  as far as I remember.  Good.  But, all the munchkins were like Down syndrome people.  Because, you know, they all kind of look, you know,  and they worked it like that.  They had to work it like that.  But, probably, plus, we can remember the lines.  Yeah.  You know?  It's easy to stand there on a lollipop.  It's kind of hard to...  You're supposed to say, hey, Dorothy, not... 
[01:07:30]  Could you not say...  You bring up a good point.  I don't think the munchkins really had to talk much,  except for some key munchkins.  Sir, stop trying to eat the little dog.  Hey, the Dick Clark.  That's what I was trying to find.  Everyone's commenting about Dick Clark New Year's Eve.  Yeah.  His rockin' New Year's Eve, or New Year's rockin' Eve,  whatever he calls that stupid thing.  It's New Year's rockin' Eve.  New Year's rockin' Eve.  By the way, that's Dick Clark right there, clearing his throat. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, but we all do stuff like that.  Yeah, but...  Listen to it.  Oof.  Where's Stroke Phlegm, if I ever heard it?  Where's the audio of Dick Clark?  You're so hot around here?  Phlegm fighting his way up the right side of the throat.  Thank you, sir.  Oops.  Well, everyone's commenting in the New York Post.  Yeah.  And they're being very honest with their comments, by the way.  Yeah, I heard a few newscasts.  Unlike the Today Show and the Good Morning America thing, 
[01:08:30]  saying how courageous it was.  Very controversial.  This was the first break Dick Clark did on New Year's Eve.  Ladies and gentlemen, back where he belongs, the one and only Mr. Dick Clark.  Dick, take it away.  Thank you, Ryan, very much.  It was really good to be back with you again this year.  Last year, I had a stroke.  I'm not being kind of in bad shape.  I had to teach myself how to walk and talk all over again.  It was a long, hard fight. 
[01:09:00]  My speech is not perfect, but I'm getting there.  Now, you and I have been a part of each other's lives on so many New Year's Eves that I wouldn't have missed this for the world.  Thanks to everybody who made it possible for me to be here tonight.  It's going to be a great night, full of fun, full of excitement, full of color, and just the happiest time in all of my life.  Thank you once again for being with us and me with you. 
[01:09:30]  Yikes.  Yeah, exactly.  God damn.  In the post, they got comments all over the place.  It was a truly weird experience to listen to him, wrote blogger Thane Plambeck.  My wife kept looking over at me with a deeply disturbed look on her face as if the ghost of Christmas past was blocking her view of the TV.  Another guy writes, I have to say that Dick Clark's agent needs to be fired.  Whoever let him appear on camera is more concerned with Dick Clark Enterprises than they are about this man as a human being. 
[01:10:00]  And finally, this guy writes, the truth is people who have had strokes freak the rest of us out.  Jeez.  All right, that's blatantly honest.  That's a lot of honest comments in the post today.  Nobody tells Dick Clark what to do, though.  Believe me, he wanted to do it.  A lot less.  Yeah.  A lot less he was courageous and all that.  I don't know.  The, I guess, American Stroke Federation, is there one of those, Foundation, was praising him. 
[01:10:30]  Saying it was great that he got out there and, you know, gave stroke victims a face.  Opiate a droopy one.  But it was a face.  What were they going to say?  Yeah, I know.  Well, that didn't work out.  Hide them.  Yeah.  Hide them.  Leper.  Leper.  I don't know.  I think it is kind of a courageous thing for the guy to come out there and do that.  Of course it is.  If it was on his own terms and shit, get out there and, you know, you remember him as being one way. 
[01:11:00]  He could have just went into hiding, and you remember Dick Clark being Dick Clark, and that's it.  But now, the memory you have of Dick Clark, that's it.  Yeah.  The one you just played.  The rating's going to be massive, and that's why they did it.  Yeah.  Simple as that.  Was it full of fun and full of excitement, though?  No, no.  But he said it would be.  Not a bit of fun or excitement, and I guarantee this wasn't the best time of his life.  But Mariah Carey was there.  Wasn't that fun and exciting? 
[01:11:30]  No.  It wasn't fun for anyone.  No.  It was awful.  Hey, are you guys watching Flavor of Love?  It's the greatest.  What?  It's the greatest TV show ever.  I have not heard of this.  It's Flavor Flay!  Oh.  Flavor Flay?  And he's in a mansion.  Uh-huh.  And he has a bunch of ghetto chicks fighting for his love.  Like crack whore ghetto chicks?  Well, pretty much. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah?  Pretty much.  The real ghetto?  Well, they haven't been in a mansion.  No?  Are they stealing shit?  And it looks like they haven't drank the Cristal before.  No?  They're getting bottles of Chrissy?  And it looks like they haven't eaten the fine fried chicken and everything else that's around.  Wow.  Okay.  What?  This has to be on, what, VH1?  It's Celeb Reality.  Celeb Reality.  Which is my favorite TV genre.  Flavor.  Really pulling it out.  So it's Flavor Flav, and he's trying to find a woman. 
[01:12:30]  So he's in a mansion with these 20 broads.  Mm-hmm.  And then the first week he, like, kicked out five.  They must have been pissed.  And really pissed.  They all have the nails and the hair.  Black chicks love them long nails.  Love them long nails.  And the fatter the black girl, the longer those fucking nails are.  Till they're like gaffing hooks.  They're fucking hooks.  That is so disgusting.  Jimmy's got a problem with that. 
[01:13:00]  No, no, no, no.  What's wrong with that?  Bring in the milk.  Just smell it.  Bring in the milk.  I just smell it.  I'm just going to make sure it's okay.  That's all right.  Is it?  I don't know.  I had milk this morning.  You know what my mommy always said?  When in doubt, throw it out.  Words to live by, Lloyd.  My mommy always said, if it smells like fish, a tasty dish.  If it smells like cologne, leave it alone.  Your mom?  Yeah.  She'd laugh and elbow me.  Oh, what a joy. 
[01:13:30]  Richard Simmons is on TV.  Oh, look.  He ran into the production room.  What a treat for everybody.  And he's massaging the various producers.  How much exercise should these folks be doing every day?  Well, if you eat every day, which I know you do.  Now, climb the rope, guys.  Now, suck a cock.  If you eat every day, exercise 45 minutes to an hour.  Seriously?  You don't do that?  Yeah.  Well, I mean, every single day.  Look at this little body.  You have a cute little body.  You must be doing stuff.  Quit it some more, Richard.  Now, take a nice deep breath and inhale. 
[01:14:00]  Why is this guy still...  45 minutes of intense exercise every day?  You're exhausted already.  He's chubby and he's flabby.  And he's going to tell us to work out.  And the other guy looks great, but I know she wants to get an even better shot.  Oh, no.  They're dancing to Oh Mickey.  It's the same shit he's been doing for 20 years.  It's like enough with this fucking faggot running in and just making everybody put their hands  in and they're politely doing it instead of saying, get out of here.  You look like Juan Epstein, you fucking pole smoker.  Beat it, Ruth.  We're tired of you.  This guy is...  Are you sure that's not the serious bank vault he's running in to take out 8 million? 
[01:14:30]  You shitheads.  This guy's not even close to being in shape.  He's awful.  No, he's never been in shape.  His bedazzled tank top.  He works out enough to keep him from being hugely fat, which he would be.  Right.  But he does a few jumping jacks.  He's got his short shorts on.  He makes people put their arms up and go from one side to the other with their arms, and  he's off to another cock.  And we're all a little embarrassed for him, so they do like, oh, it's Richard. 
[01:15:00]  You'll do it because it's Richard.  All right, everybody.  Look, the cameraman's doing it.  Ugh.  I would just stand there going, no.  No.  I wish someone could do Richard Simmons.  This is what would happen if he said to me, go on.  Put your arms in the air.  Can you do Richard Simmons, anybody?  Oh, I'll just give a try.  Okay.  Go on.  Put your arms in the air.  Why don't you die, faggot?  Okay.  Die, faggot.  Wait. 
[01:15:30]  There's a baseball on our street.  You played baseball.  I did.  I ate.  Oh.  We didn't play baseball.  You ate balls.  There is hope out there.  Just try your best.  Be committed to your own body.  Yes.  Exercise.  Do you hear that, everybody?  Six.  What is it?  Five.  Four.  No one's chiming in.  No one.  My number one victim, and we'll be back after your local name.  They can't stand this guy.  Quiet, you verbose sissy.  This is a production room.  Oh, thank you so much.  You faggot.  Excuse me.  Our first anti-free radio commercial has come in. 
[01:16:00]  Are you kidding?  We just brought this up.  Jimmy concocted the idea mere minutes ago.  And we're also going to hand this off to the listeners as well.  Oh, I love when it goes to the listeners.  I hate when it goes to the listeners.  Now, again, this is to be played on free FM on the radio.  Yes.  This may be a rough idea.  I don't know where this is going to go.  Wait, how can it be played on the radio?  Like, they're using...  No, it's got to be played on satellite radio. 
[01:16:30]  Right, Jimmy.  It's anti-free radio.  The anti-satellite ads.  It's anti-free radio, right?  But we're buying ads on free radio.  They won't take them.  They will.  That's like us taking ads for free radio.  We don't take ads, remember?  No, we're just playing anti-free radio ads on satellite radio.  Right.  Did you get the bit right, Jimmy?  Well, I came up with it.  I'm trying to make a little bit of money for everybody, and I want to be playing it to  the audience.  We already have the audience.  Why are we going to preach to the converted?  They used to play satellite ads on regular radio.  They don't anymore. 
[01:17:00]  This doesn't say satellite.  I'm not dumb.  This is an anti-free radio ad.  It is very clearly an anti-free radio ad.  Let's listen in on this.  Free FM.  If you want your daughter to lay down with a n***h, free FM.  It just sucks.  Now, pony up, fucko.  See?  It works on satellite radio.  I like that.  There shouldn't be any bleeping on satellite radio, by the way.  I don't know what that was.  That was my idea only because it was going to be played on regular FM. 
[01:17:30]  How does it make sense to be played on regular radio?  Because we're preaching to the choir here.  If you have satellite, you've committed to satellite.  Don't want your daughter betting down with a Nickelodeon employee.  That was what it was, actually.  Yeah, that's what I heard.  Well, that's the first of many, I'm sure.  Listeners, send in your anti-free radio commercials.  There you go.  Run with it, listeners.  Way to not beep out the fuck out at the end.  Oh, really?  Let me hear that again.  And by the way, if you're going to make one of these, make it short. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, these epics the listeners fucking give us.  Free FM.  If you want your daughter to lay down with a n***h, free FM.  It just sucks.  Now, pony up, fuckos.  Yeah, that should have been beeped because then it would have been played on regular radio.  Right.  I get it.  But it's going to be on satellite radio.  Okay, I'll redo that one.  Yeah.  Good job.  Oh, good.  Uh-oh.  I guess the boys are coming up with more.  So, Flavor Flay.  Yes.  Flavor of Love on VH1. 
[01:18:30]  That and Celebrity Fit Club, my two favorite shows.  Oh, the Fatty Show.  The Fatty Show, which is just great.  And Flavor Flay is living with these women in this really nice house, and he's going to  pick his new girl.  His new babe.  And they're all fighting over him, which I think is hilarious considering he used to  be, what, a crackhead and hadn't had a hit in 10 years.  He's been arrested for domestic violence.  Oh, he's just the worst.  He's a mess.  But they're fighting over him.  They're fighting over him.  And one girl is saying that, you know, the money and Flavor Flay is already hers because 
[01:19:00]  she has 34 double D boobies, which you know are just beautiful and perky.  Ugh.  They're the flat kind?  Oh, the flat.  Of course they are.  Of course they are.  They're the flat kind.  When black people get stretch marks, they're awful because they discolor.  So it's like the light.  You can see the stretch marks.  It's really obvious.  So let's listen in to Flavor Flay explaining his loneliness.  Hey, yo.  I've got fame and fortune.  I've got rare valuable works of art. 
[01:19:30]  I've got a mad domestic stand.  I've got limos.  I've got limos.  I've got all of the finest things in life.  I've got a nice big mansion.  None of these things makes nerve.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Without a woman to spend it with.  Yeah. 
[01:20:00]  He's lonely.  He's lovely.  And he says, Flavor Flay.  About a hundred times per episode.  Of course he does.  Diamond Dave.  Skibbity-bee-bop-boo.  Running with the devil.  Better than the other two, but I think it's the same guy.  Give me a little more.  Running with the devil.  Looking for some pointers, boys. 
[01:20:30]  Free FM.  All right.  It's awful.  All right.  David Lee Bee Gees.  Here's Flavor Flay to explain the concept of the show.  I want to find somebody that I want to share my world with.  With.  Me and Bridget is still friends, but she's married.  Romantically, we're over.  Done.  Because she's somebody's wife.  If I ever got married, I don't want nobody messing with my wife.  Word.  Word.  Sometimes Flavor Flay gets lonely. 
[01:21:00]  So here's what I'm going to do.  I'm going to take 20 girls, and I'm going to put them to the test.  And I'm going to see which one of these girls love Flavor Flay the best.  The best.  I know y'all heard of that show called The Bachelor.  Flavor Flay is a flaxcala.  Oh, my God.  It's the worst, best show on TV. 
[01:21:30]  He is just a disaster.  He really is.  Any clips of the bitches?  Oh, yeah.  It's coming up.  I'm sorry.  I want to hear the bitches.  We're slowly working into this.  The bitches.  I think here's the first bitch.  I've been a fan of Flay since the first time I saw him.  And he let me know that it was okay to be loud and to be boisterous and to be full of life.  That is exactly why I think this is my soulmate.  She sounded like she was getting emotional.  Yeah.  Oh, the girls are crying already and everything. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, that's great.  Good.  They got lunatics.  Because they have nothing.  I love when they pick psychopathic.  Because they have absolutely nothing going on in their lives.  No.  This is a really big thing.  So, some of the girls are crying throughout the whole first show.  They're fighting over them.  Fantastic.  It's going to just be a train wreck.  I have to see this one.  Flay can't speak here.  All right, y'all.  Check this out.  The man Flay, he is not good with names at all.  So, what I'm going to attempt to do is give each one of y'all a nickname so that way I can remember it. 
[01:22:30]  And the reason why I pick nicknames is because I knew I wouldn't remember their real names.  And nicknames I might can remember easier.  So, he gives all the girls nicknames.  I might can remember easier.  Yeah, and he's taking, like, name tags with their nicknames.  Yeah, and pretty much molesting the girls.  Oh, really?  Putting them on their tits?  Yeah, like this and rubbing and stuff.  Nicknames?  Is that what it is?  Nicknames.  All right.  What? 
[01:23:00]  All right.  Let's see what I'm going to call you.  Um...  Um...  Um...  Um...  Um...  Um...  Um...  Um... 
[01:23:30]  Um...  All right.  Okay.  Check this out.  Um.  Uh, like, excuse me, I mean?  Shells.  I'm giving you the name, Shells.  Shells?  Oh, my God.  How does anyone work with that guy?  I don't know.  It says, um, for 35 seconds. 
[01:24:00]  Um, um, um.  And that comes up with Shells as their nickname.  And that's a show.  Shells.  Well, when I was putting the name tags on the girls, my hands were somewhat doing a little traveling.  You like apples?  I love apples.  But, hey, you know, I was looking to see who had the softest chest.  I like soft chest.  Woo-ha!  God, I hate the music in these, the way these things are produced. 
[01:24:30]  Oh, the producers that put them all together.  Yeah.  It's very crazy being in the midst of all these women and everybody fighting for their  affection of wanting to die.  You know, it kind of reminded me of like a, um, a ghetto prom and everybody had the same  date.  It's like a ghetto prom.  Ghetto prom.  Uh-huh.  Why does everything have to have music behind it?  Can't they just talk? 
[01:25:00]  Because it makes it more interesting.  But it does, nope.  David Lee Roth's doing that right now.  He has that music behind him.  Oh, yeah, he does.  I, I, I don't believe it.  He has a bed?  Well, he's like, you know.  Works with a?  Well, he'll play his, you know, he has some kind of music in the background when he stops  talking.  They crank it up for a second, then they bring it back down.  It's just a mess.  Uh, Dirk in South Carolina.  You wonder why white people hate black people.  Listen to that tape.  Jeez.  Sir, we don't hate black people.  Was that where we were going, sir? 
[01:25:30]  Just dislike.  Okay.  Afraid.  Yes.  Just a worry.  Hopefully this will get a little more interesting.  Contessa makes out with Flav the first night.  Right?  And everyone else gets jealous and pissed off.  A woman should make a man feel.  Like a man.  Like a man.  That's right.  You don't need to make a man feel like a.  You should make a woman.  Exactly.  Feel like a woman.  Exactly.  I can make you feel just like that. 
[01:26:00]  You guys, you're making out.  What the hell is that?  Can I kiss you on the bling in the nose?  On the bling in the nose.  Oh, you're so wonderful.  His hands felt so good on my little Coco Puff.  His hand like cups right under my ass.  I like it when you do that right there.  Right there.  I'm going to be the last one standing. 
[01:26:30]  I'm ready to just be like, uh-uh.  Get the roll in the neck or whatever I got to do.  Get ghetto.  I don't care.  The Dick Clark kiss at midnight was sexier.  My Coco Puff.  Is that her ass?  This guy is going to get so much ass because these girls have no morals whatsoever.  Yeah, he's just going to fuck them all?  I think so because they show like coming attractions.  He's in bed with a different one like every day. 
[01:27:00]  Is that what I missed?  Some of the lingo?  Coco Puff.  Is that a black chick's ass now?  Yeah, I guess so.  Yeah.  The Coco Puff?  I guess so.  We'll have to start working that in.  So it's used as much as 24-7.  So already he's making out with chicks, right?  And then there's other girls that are drinking waiting for his attention.  So they're drinking too much.  And one kind of drank a little too much here.  The Goldie drank too much.  I've got to get up for me. 
[01:27:30]  All you have to do is take care of the 10 minutes.  Can you do that for me, please?  And so I get up and I go over there.  And she's like passed out on the couch.  I was like, you summon up whatever you have inside of you.  And you get up off this couch.  Oh, snap!  Did she just hurl chants in the living room?  I just hope she's not anywhere near my bed. 
[01:28:00]  Where's her glass of water?  Oh, it smells like chicken.  She's just puking all over the house.  Did she say it smells like chicken?  Yeah.  Chicken smelling vomit.  The little dialogue that was there.  Yeah.  It's all about the music.  Way to blast apart that stereotype.  Vomit smells like chicken.  Quick, get some watermelon wash.  Jesus Christ. 
[01:28:30]  And here's some of the girls fighting over Flav.  Oh, yay.  He's such a catch.  Excuse me.  It's time for my...  I'd like to borrow him for a minute, if that's okay.  He's in demand, if you don't mind.  What Flav and I have going on is totally different from what I have going on with these girls in the house.  I'm being so much.  Bye!  There's like a loud pack of idiot bitches, and I'm sick of them already. 
[01:29:00]  I'm so sorry.  Okay, will you sit here with me?  With these other chicks, you know, I may smile at them, but we are here about business.  Flav is going to be my man, and they have to realize it.  I will tell you, when you walked in the door, I was totally amazed.  Hey, well, we thought, you know, we'd come check out what's going on.  Just one second one second.  Oh, ladies, I have to ask you to leave.  You don't mind.  This is my personal time with Flav.  Oh, you may or may not have a chance, but if you can assist you, you are well. 
[01:29:30]  All right, then.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You've got to make a voice in your voice.  You only have a certain amount of time to cross him, and she was totally hogging him.  The competitiveness is coming out already.  Is that a word?  Competitiveness.  Yes.  No, excuse you.  Sorry.  No, no.  You can go outside.  No, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no.  He'll be with you in just a minute.  They all need to go on home now, because Flav is already my man.  This is my mansion and my money.  Just fighting over him.  It's not Flav's mansion, is it? 
[01:30:00]  No.  Of course not.  So they're not going to get the mansion.  It's my man, my mansion.  I guess they're giving money to the girl that wins.  I ain't leaving, motherfucker.  They probably don't know it's not his house, either.  They probably say, yeah, it's Flav's house.  What do you go?  Yeah, right?  I see the deed.  Let's go.  Right.  Let's go.  I got my attorney here.  I want to see a deed.  That's funny.  No, they don't.  They don't.  Stupid broad.  He lives in New Brunswick.  Hey, Tony, what's up? 
[01:30:30]  Orange soda gets the stains out a lot better.  Jesus.  Thank you, Tony.  Diamond Dave checking in.  Diamond Dave.  Skippity-bee-ba-boo.  I'm back again, boys.  Hey, I think this is the same Diamond Dave.  Sammy Hagar sucks.  All right.  Thank you.  I just want to jump, jump, jump, jump.  I will jump.  Oh, he's singing a little Van Halen for us.  Ramone, bring me a six-month buffer before Adam Carolla shows up. 
[01:31:00]  Running with the devil.  All right.  A little running with the devil.  Panama.  Panama.  Yeah.  Panama.  He's doing, like, a whole montage of his songs, a little medley.  Doesn't he have to do his own show?  Why is he calling this program?  Yeah.  I'm just looking for pointers for you.  I've got 30 minutes of commercials.  B-b-b-boys. 
[01:31:30]  I don't think that's David.  David Lee Mittman.  All right.  Now we know it's not you.  I don't ask.  Let's go to Joe in Buffalo.  Joe.  Hey, I was just calling to see if they were going to give one of the girls UPS.  Oh, very good.  Sounds just like her.  Thank you, Joe.  All right.  Thanks.  Boo got shot.  I thought they was giving the man UPS.  Can't find it.  Not immediately.  Oh, that's because it was back here.  All right.  I've seen the cops knocking the truck window out, and I thought they was giving the man UPS. 
[01:32:00]  I thought the man was dead.  That's the way it was.  Giving the man UPS.  Indeed.  Eric in Colorado.  Eric.  Hey, morning, boys.  Good morning.  I hate to be Captain Obvious here, but, you know, when Flav was on with you guys several  months ago, didn't he say he had, like, 20 kids with, like, a dozen different women,  and now he's looking for another one?  Yeah, he did. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  You know, I don't know.  Captain Obvious here, but what about them women?  And I don't think he pays the child support.  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, isn't there a stereotype he's trying to break you?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Jimmy has to field something here.  Let's change your name from Captain Obvious to Admiral Awful.  Well, hey, what the fuck?  Fucking once was bad enough.  Yeah.  Corporal Cornball.  Jesus Christ, enough one time was bad enough. 
[01:33:00]  And then when you used a Captain Obvious twice.  We get it, gentle jerk-off.  In charge of the redundant regimen.  If I had two divisions of men like this, this radio show would be over very quickly.  Captain Obvious.  I hate to be Captain Obvious so much, but I'll say it again.  I'm Captain Obvious.  Captain Obvious here.  Put a cape on, and then take the other end and tie it around a tree, and hang yourself. 
[01:33:30]  You'll be fucking Captain Cadaver, and then we can all rest each other.  All right, well.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Dunk.  So after a couple days of partying and drinking and puking and Flavor Flav, feeling up the girls,  he starts eliminating them.  That's right.  He hands out big clocks to the girls that are staying.  Oh, God.  His trademark.  That's right.  That's right.  All right, ladies, check this out.  Just want y'all to know that this is the most difficult part for me right here. 
[01:34:00]  You know what I'm saying?  All of y'all are beautiful.  All of y'all are lovely.  All of y'all can't stay.  You know that.  Whoever get a clock, you know what time it is.  Whoever don't get a clock, that means your time is up.  I like the time with the time and clock.  Time is up.  It's very creative.  Here's the clock.  You know what time it is.  So then he eliminated five girls, and they all drank, were drinking champagne. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  The ones that stayed.  Some Chrissy.  But there were some empty glasses and a little left in the old bottle, so he poured it out  because they weren't going to have any.  They all poured out a little for the girls that aren't here no more.  That's right.  I don't know why they do the clock thing.  I hate the word tie-in.  You know it's your time to go if he hands you, like, a little infant that you weren't expecting.  And, like, what's that mean?  You beat it.  So, one of the eliminated girls... 
[01:35:00]  Hated to be capped.  Navious.  Oh, sorry.  Yeah.  That sergeant sucked.  Eliminated girl breaks down here.  And all the girls that don't have clocks, thanks, man.  And if there's no hard feelings, come say goodbye to me.  I really wanted it, but I don't know what Flav didn't like about me.  Whoever don't have clocks, come on through. 
[01:35:30]  I have a lot of emotions going through with me right now.  I'm confused, upset, I'm surprised.  I thought I made a connection with them.  God bless you.  I just don't understand.  I don't deserve it.  I'm, like, way better than half those chicks that he kept here.  And I just am so upset.  I'm bummed for Flav that Sirius and New York are here  because I think those two, in particular, are here for their own agenda 
[01:36:00]  and not really for Flav.  Thank you, darling.  Thank you.  Very much.  It's been a pleasure.  Thank you.  I'm pissed off.  I'm upset.  My feelings are hurt because I'm a very sensitive person.  I wish he would have given me more of a chance.  I feel like he gave clocks to a lot of girls who really didn't deserve them.  Some women that stayed blondie that puked in a bucket, a gallon, a puke,  and she stayed.  Of course, dummies.  I didn't want to go home.  I just didn't want to go home. 
[01:36:30]  Oh, wow.  That's why.  I love it.  Right back to apartment 27D in the houses somewhere in Brooklyn.  That's what I mean.  That's why.  I know this was a little slow, but trust me, this show is going to be great.  Exactly, Jimmy.  Nobody wants to go back to that.  This was her chance to get out of the ghetto,  and she failed miserably right off the bat.  And Flavor Flav keeps the girl that was puking in a bucket.  Of course you keep the puking girl.  It's reality television, dummy.  And that means she's one of the loose ones. 
[01:37:00]  The girl should have vomited herself.  That's right.  That's who they're going to keep, not...  I wouldn't be here.  I thought I had you.  I'm better than half the girls you kept in.  Shut up.  You've got to test things.  I'm going to have a reality show like this, actually.  All right.  And I want to get every gal to wear very snug, white spandex pants with no undershorts.  Oh.  And then we'll have the Guess Who Stays part of the program.  Uh-huh.  Whoever's little thin Asian slit is gone. 
[01:37:30]  Nothing.  You need a camel to...  Is it a camel?  I bailed on that thought before.  I appreciate you trying to hold my hand through it.  Oh, this is...  Wait, I...  Hello, exactly!  I stink and I don't like it.  This is how I have to get my own idea across.  I'll like laugh and fake laugh and clap at my gloves.  I'm...  Fucking doing visuals. 
[01:38:00]  That was so awful that I bailed on it before I finished.  And I appreciate my friend Anthony trying to help me.  Because I like the idea of a reality show based on the camel toe.  Yeah, but I just...  My thing was, I just was looking over and I was watching his knuckles.  Like, open knuckles are bending, which meant a button was getting pushed soon.  And I'm like...  Oh, really?  Yeah, he was...  I just got very uncomfortable.  I thought...  You should have.  It was awful.  See, now me, I thought he was going somewhere.  No.  I thought you had a way that they would be eliminated. 
[01:38:30]  No.  No.  No.  I had a little thought that shit kind of kept to me.  Yeah.  Instead, a lot of people heard it.  And there was nothing funny remotely surrounding it.  Remote.  It really was a mote of dullness surrounding that thought.  Let's go to New Hampshire and say hi to Just the Gigolo.  Oh.  Just the Gigolo.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  You're not a guy.  You can't be a gigolo.  New year, new bits.  That's right.  New year, new bits.  That's right.  We're listening to Flavor Flav. 
[01:39:00]  You're a Nigolo.  Listen, Anthony, I need you to do a little product promotion for me.  Yes.  What was the name of those wipes that you use on your ass?  Oh, my God.  What's wrong with your ass?  Not my ass.  My husband.  It's his birthday, and I'd like to get him some of these wipes, and I can't remember the  name of them.  Does he get cranky ass?  Not really, but...  It's brilliant that they stopped using the name Baby Wipes.  Yeah.  It's brilliant, because now adults are buying these things like crazy.  Let me tell you, for the new listeners, these things are a godsend. 
[01:39:30]  We talked about them a few months back.  No more cranky ass.  They're called SOS.  You get them, and he'll be very comfortable with them.  Scrub up real good with steel wool and some...  And vinegar.  Bleach and vinegar.  You mix them together.  You smoke a cigarette over it, and then you wipe your ass with it really rough.  But it helps.  They are...  Ma'am, I would not endorse any single one.  I know there are a few brands out there.  There's one... 
[01:40:00]  What do you use, Opie?  Clorox Wipes.  No, no.  Those are the ones you use to clean your toilet.  Don't get him Clorox.  Clorox Wipes work great.  No, make sure they're made by a toilet paper company.  It's a little treat as you're driving to work.  A little sting.  No, no.  You want either Charmin.  I know Charmin makes some.  Yeah.  Even Scott Tissue, but I haven't tried that.  I think it'd be a nice treat for his ass on his birthday.  Let me tell you something.  Happy birthday, honey.  They're so alloy nice and so cool to the touch that if you have a rough time on the bowl, 
[01:40:30]  then normally the toilet paper would be the only thing you're going to use.  You use some of these moist little towelette wipes that are specially made now for adults  to use.  And you give it a good finish up.  And you're so clean and so nice.  It's wonderful.  Jimmy, you don't use those?  No, no, no.  I'm thinking about her.  How about if you're this guy's wife and you love him and it's his birthday, how about after  he's done you eat his ass and then you gargle and deal with it? 
[01:41:00]  Well, hey, that might be a possibility.  We don't know.  Don't be so selfish.  Well, hey, what?  No, I don't like those things.  They kind of dry out your ass a little bit.  It's not always about you.  What?  Yeah, exactly.  I heard they dry your dress a little bit.  They don't dry your ass out.  What's wrong with everybody's asshole?  I just use toilet paper.  My crack is wrong.  Nothing's wrong.  Hold on, Jimmy.  There's not many people out there that shove the toilet paper up their actual asshole,  though.  Dude, I get it all nice and clean.  I'm immaculate.  I fucking wrap the paper up my finger and I push it up and pull it out.  That's why you don't need the baby wipes. 
[01:41:30]  It really is disgusting.  It's clean.  It's disgusting.  You can get up there with the wipe.  You can.  The baby wipe thing.  What it does, you're saying, why bother when there's toilet paper and you get clean and  stuff?  That's true.  But you could also survive on crackers and water when you can have filet mignon.  This is a way of, it's a fancy way to wipe your ass, Jimmy.  I thought you were a fancy man.  I am, but I didn't look at the old steak dinner for your asshole angle.  Now I do.  That's what it is.  It's a steak dinner for the ass. 
[01:42:00]  You're absolutely right.  I just made the analogy, but you put it in terms everyone could understand.  That's right.  I'm the every man.  All right, Justin Gigolo.  All right.  Well, thank you so much.  Whose birthday are we celebrating again?  My husband, Scotty Ray.  Happy birthday.  I'm getting this from a fan who, wow, must know me very well.  Cottonelle Quilted Baby. 
[01:42:30]  It doesn't say baby on the thing anymore.  Oh, it doesn't.  She's just calling me baby.  Okay.  It's Cottonelle Quilted.  Yeah.  Put that comma.  You have to put a comma before baby.  Let's go to Tim in North Carolina.  Tim, what's up?  Yeah, what's going on?  If my wife called the show asking about baby wipes, I'd cut her fucking throat.  Yeah, not only did she call up on this guy's birthday to talk about baby wipes, she gave  his first and last name, so we now know that guy has a dirty, filthy ass.  Dirty, cranky, itchy ass. 
[01:43:00]  Someone needs to punch that bitch in the fucking uterus.  It's disgusting.  Way to handle it appropriately, sir.  Now this is a good David Lee Roth impression.  Yes.  Bozy, bozy, bop.  Titty, bop.  Hit her in the uterus.  Hey.  All right.  Listening to himself on the radio.  I know.  I do it, too.  Let's go to Anthony on Long Island.  Anthony.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Hi.  I'm looking at this Gold Tooth Knitter's website on VH1. 
[01:43:30]  Flavor Flav?  Yeah, Flavor Flav.  I got to be thinking that their fathers, the white girls' fathers are so proud that they're  decked out with this guy.  Oh, yeah.  I did forget to mention some of the girls are white.  I apologize for that.  Yes.  A lot of mongrel racist people.  A lot of mongrel class of reality show.  Watch it out.  Were there white chicks on this, too?  Yeah, I apologize.  They should have just loaded it up.  You know why?  I didn't really talk about the white chicks.  They didn't really do much of anything.  That's what I'm saying.  It was all the ghetto girls, you know, getting all the action. 
[01:44:00]  Black chicks are a lot more interesting on reality shows.  A lot more.  Yeah.  All right.  We should take a break, I guess.  Cool.  Oh, they're doing Psycho Fear Factor?  Yeah, what is that about?  You and your family, I guess, have to live, like, in fear for an entire day and night.  Like, you'll be trying to sleep and someone will bust through your door with an axe.  This is going to be scary.  You know they're not going to hit you with it.  Yeah. 
[01:44:30]  Unless they're black with thick glasses being pushed in a wheelchair.  Oh, he's dumb enough.  There's a tree pushing him.  Hello?  Is anybody home?  Your son.  Oh, no.  A retard.  A retard.  Retard.  Being pushed by an oak tree.  You put all your thick glasses and then painted your face silver. 
[01:45:00]  Yes, they are corrective lenses.  Oh, my God.  He was nearsighted.  So was his mother.  Her eyes had to be corrected too.  Oh, my God.  Is this just in?  Not to interrupt you.  Oh, that's all right.  But Than just handed in a huge project, his homework assignment from yesterday.  Ooh.  30 tracks.  30 tracks.  Yellow Brick Road.  Retarded production of Wizard of Oz. 
[01:45:30]  All set and ready to go.  Can we have a thumbs up?  Because that is...  Than-tastic.  Than-tastic.  How good is the audio?  Awesome.  Awesome?  There's no trabtastic, is there?  No.  There's no darer-tastic.  No.  It does...  He doesn't...  I read his list.  He goes, I don't want there to be.  There's a fantastic, though.  That's right.  There's actually...  There's travable.  There's travesty.  Because every time he puts his little fucking wristless fingers into something, he wrecks 
[01:46:00]  it.  Where's that creep?  Wristler.  People have tried to come up with new ones for the other people, like Travulous.  Travulous?  Travulous.  That's awful.  What's Danny?  They sound gay.  What did Danny end up being?  Oh, here comes Travulous, Travis.  Yes, Travulous?  Danny's is the worst.  He's fan-dastic.  How about dantastic?  Yeah, wouldn't it be dantastic?  Why wouldn't dantastic work?  Or fool around a little bit and call it dan-fast-astic? 
[01:46:30]  Dan-what?  Dan-tastic is fun.  I thought...  Have you seen for a second?  Yeah, there you go.  Yeah.  Come over here.  Reach across.  Yeah, go ahead, Jimmy.  There it is.  It's that one.  That's the one I always play when you fuck up.  Right there.  Fuck you, Jimmy.  Ooh, that's not good.  Jimmy pushes a button.  How'd I do?  How'd I do?  You did great.  You did wonderful.  Maybe you will get a machine.  Dan, come back from Hollywood. 
[01:47:00]  I guess that was too close to Tham.  It is fantastic, but just with a d in front.  Let's all be real here.  There was also erotic, which was...  Yeah.  They're pushing.  They're trying.  What would erotic be?  I don't know.  I guess erotic is not as good as fantastic.  A naked girl with a WW off...  Oh, WW awful.  Wait, let me see which one I want.  Yeah, Wolfie.  How about the do-over button?  Oh, let me see which one I want. 
[01:47:30]  How about the we're all friends, we understand it happens button?  Oh, man, we need more.  You look like assholes right now, Matt.  That's right.  Fuck this idiot.  You are.  Oh, fuck this idiot.  That's funny.  I'm funny.  Asshole.  Asshole.  Did you see that jerk? 
[01:48:00]  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!  W-W off.  You dick!  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Oh, just for fun.  Just for fun.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Banana phone! 
[01:48:30]  Wow.  All right.  When we get back, the yellow brick road,  the retiree production of The Wizard of Oz.  I have a feeling that free radio is not going to give you such a treat.  Oh, of course not.  And Bill Burr stopping by to say hi, too?  Very cool.  All right.  Yeah.  Oh, you want to play that?  Yeah, let's play that.  Play a little prank call.  Good old red.  Red.  Good old red.  Why are you yelling? 
[01:49:00]  Yeah, we like these.  Here goes Iraq.  Is she not right?  Is she insane?  Well, she now.  Run, run, run, run.  It's this day.  Is she not right?  Is she insane?  Well, she now.  Run, run, run.  Run, run, run.  Is she not right?  Drool with an iron fist.  Made Hawk jump.  Did you see him?  Uh-uh.  No.  He jumped.  Well, we're flying to Vegas tomorrow for the CES. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, the CES, Consumer Electronics Show.  That's right.  And we're broadcasting Thursday and Friday.  For a couple hours each day.  A couple hours each day.  I don't even know what time it is.  What time is it east?  Eastern.  I really don't know.  What time do we go on Eastern?  It might be like 2 in the afternoon, I'm guessing.  2 to 4 Eastern?  Yeah.  Okay.  11 to 1 out there, I think.  No.  I guess.  Wait, wait.  1.  1 to 3.  Eastern.  Remember that.  1 to 3 Eastern.  That's 10 to noon at my home time. 
[01:50:00]  Why?  So Vegas, that's...  10 to 12.  12.  11.  10 a.m. to noon?  10.  But not here.  In Vegas.  To noon.  Vegas time.  It's such a joke.  We have to take a day off to fly to do two two-hour shows.  Two two-hour shows.  But I know what happens during this shit.  We fly out there, and they have us flying very early in the morning.  I have to get up tomorrow earlier than I have to get up to do the show.  Aw.  Aw.  Yeah.  Well, I don't give a shit about anyone. 
[01:50:30]  I'm not looking for sympathy, so I don't give a shit when I don't get it.  Ooh.  I say fuck everyone now.  Ooh.  Look at you.  You know what my life is about these days?  Me.  My life is about me.  Fuck everyone.  Atta boy.  That's my new mantra.  New.  Fuck them all.  Oh, you can.  I spent my life bending over backwards and forward occasionally, making everybody happy.  Now it's all about me.  So here is what's happening tomorrow. 
[01:51:00]  We're flying out very early.  They got us early flights because, why?  They waited until the last minute to make flight reservations for something we go to every year.  And again, next year you'll hear us, bitch, because next year they'll make reservations late again.  It just happens that way.  Yeah.  So we're taking a very early flight.  We're going to get there.  And sometimes they think it's a good idea.  And I think it's more so that they want to show us that they're doing something.  Like, guys, we want to have you come down to the display at the convention center. 
[01:51:30]  Look around.  See what your broadcast facility is going to look like.  See if you need anything, ideas.  There'll be none of that tomorrow.  There will be none of it.  I am flying into Vegas.  I am going to the hotel.  I am going right to sleep.  I will wake up at my leisure.  The rest of the evening will be spent at a hold'em table drinking cocktails until I have to be at my mic the next day.  Until then, though, nothing. 
[01:52:00]  Don't set anything up.  There's no meetings.  There's no look at the display.  There's no look at a broadcast facility.  There's no nothing.  It's in support of the facility.  That's it.  No shit.  And Hawk jumped, and I like that, to run in and make sure nothing was planned.  Hawk, results?  We're double-checking.  So far, nothing.  Double-checking.  So far, nothing.  I hope there's something very important.  Oh, you know something?  I do, too.  I hope there's a meeting with Hugh Panero.  I do, too.  I do, too, because I'm going to say you.  I wish I did.  I wish. 
[01:52:30]  I'm going to say Hugh going to have to do without me today.  How about that?  See, it's a little play on H-U-G-H-J.  That worked out nicely.  And Y-O-U.  Wait a minute.  Hugh stink.  See, I didn't go that far.  Not him, you.  I'm saying it.  Okay.  No.  We have a new anti-free radio commercial.  These things.  Who's pumping them out? 
[01:53:00]  Steve?  Steve.  Oh, boy.  We want our listeners now to get involved.  That's right.  Send in some of your own.  Make sure.  Free FM is making commercials that are very anti-satellite.  They're saying, why pay for what you can get for free here at Free FM?  Well, can we play one of them?  Yeah.  Let's play one of theirs.  I don't even know where they are.  Hawk?  That's why you're sitting next to me.  And I'm a fancy man.  I just wanted to say it.  That's what I'm saying.  Oop, right here.  Might have to fix that, too.  All right. 
[01:53:30]  Sorry.  Tough shop.  Which one do you want to hear?  Baseball, heavy metal, leading man, lewd act.  Heavy?  Which is the one where they said you can't say that on the radio?  Oh, the lewd act.  Lewd act.  This is what free radio is playing all over the ball field.  In music news, you'll never believe who was arrested on stage last night for performing a lewd act.  It was so outrageous, we can't even describe it on the radio.  You might expect this behavior from heavy metal or rap stars, 
[01:54:00]  but this time, the guilty party is none other than the easy listening sensation.  Please deposit 25 cents for the next three minutes.  Radio.  You shouldn't have to pay for it.  This message brought to you by America's 13,000 local radio stations  who believe some things were just meant to be free.  Right.  Yeah, keep playing these ads.  Is that just, does that just reek of desperation?  Especially the one where you say you can't, it's so lewd you can't say it on the radio.  Yeah.  Way to know your audience. 
[01:54:30]  Hey, we can say it.  We can say it.  We can say it.  Yeah, I thought that was like pro satellite radio.  We can't even say it.  Not only can we say the lewd act, we can say cunt.  Oh, B.  Yeah, it's going to cost you a little bit, but you're going to hear it.  No censorship.  That's right.  No 20-minute commercial breaks.  That's right.  That is right.  Bastards.  So now I guess we have our own.  That's right.  We now have our own commercials that we're running that are anti- 
[01:55:00]  Free radio.  Free radio.  We fight back.  And somebody was saying that Penn Jillette was saying that it's always funnier, like I think  on commercial, because you have to push the envelope.  The restrictions are what makes it kind of funny or naughty or something.  It's like, hey, stupid.  Your show is on Showtime.  But you can say whatever you want.  Yeah.  The title of the show is bullshit.  Yeah.  Why don't you do your show on CBS?  Yeah.  You can't say it on.  Stop.  If you want to go on there and do a show, that's fine.  Like Penn can go and do the show.  That's fine.  But to like toe the company line of bashing satellite just because you pay for it. 
[01:55:30]  You get what you pay for in this country.  Yeah.  That radio is free.  There's a reason it's free.  Take that exact product and try to make people pay for it.  See what will happen.  No, you'd have no takers because it stinks.  Here we go.  Our second anti-free radio spot from Steve.  Hi.  I like free stuff.  Like a sunny day, catching bullfrogs, getting my hiney hole tickled by Uncle Henry, and free FM.  Why don't you die, faggot? 
[01:56:00]  Free FM.  Sucks donkey dick.  Wow.  Now, was that the return of Toby?  It sure was.  Holy shit.  Toby is back.  And I don't mind it.  No, he's cute.  Because it fits in that whole thing.  We finally found a niche for Toby.  It fits in that free FM thing.  Meet Toby.  Yeah.  Hello, Bill.  How you doing? 
[01:56:30]  He's also related to Thomas Jefferson.  And before you even say it, we don't know what he is either.  That's right.  There's some black.  There's white.  There's, he's the whitest black guy.  He'd be perfect in a Michael Jackson video.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  You see how that hurts, though?  Yeah, but you're not even trying for me today.  You're not even giving me a chance.  No, that's not true.  All right.  Well, I feel you had... 
[01:57:00]  All right.  I'm not going to explain it.  Don't try.  I don't know.  Maybe it makes sense.  I mean, I must...  He has many different features.  And Michael Jackson had that video where everyone changed and they were kind of...  Oh, you're talking about the black or white.  It doesn't matter who black or white.  Oh, well, in that case.  But he's got the black features and also the white features.  Well, no, it's the hair, really.  I thought he was like that kid who watched Madonna and the Peep Show.  Runs up the street holding hands.  Kind of looked like him, too. 
[01:57:30]  I think we ought to be out.  I know, but...  You're hurting everything, I figure.  The road is icy, man.  Slow down.  Don't crash right behind me.  It's a big pile up here.  Don't follow.  All right.  Well, that was the return of Toby.  Were you a little leery about returning to the Toby roll with how it was received the first time?  I was very nervous.  Very nervous?  Because if it flopped twice, that really would have just been the end of it.  Yeah, especially since you didn't have a warning that Toby was coming back. 
[01:58:00]  No, no, it was very surprising, which I think worked out for the best.  Now, do you feel this more fits the Toby roll than the last thing?  Yes, I absolutely do.  I like it, because the free FM sucks.  Toby sucks.  And he dies.  And he dies.  The donkey dick tag at the end.  It's perfect.  Two thumbs up.  Well, the writing's much better.  The writing is much better.  I always thought that...  Different writing team on this one?  I always thought Toby had a chance, but the writing sucked.  Who wrote this one?  Sam and I.  The same people that wrote it the last time. 
[01:58:30]  Same writing team as this one?  Well, maybe you incorporated a little bit more of who you are into the Toby roll.  Yeah.  Well, there was a lot of speculation as to whether or not Toby was touched as a child.  And so Steve and I decided to...  A lot of speculation by who?  The Toby fans.  God, shut the fuck up.  Here was the speculation.  Sam's nervous with his headphones on, and Steve goes, I think Toby was touched.  Mention that.  Yeah.  I can see.  I can see.  Anyway, we can punch his mother in the fucking face. 
[01:59:00]  Can we hurt a woman in this promo?  Well, two thumbs up for the new Toby.  We look forward to the third one.  No.  Is there a third one on the way, or what?  There could be.  There could be a third one before the end of the show, Anthony.  Before the end of the show, that's pumping these out.  Yeah, why not?  Oh, amazing.  Lily says, Jimmy told me to call.  I blew him.  Ah!  No, what happened was...  Lily, Lily, what are you doing, Lily? 
[01:59:30]  Grandpa, Grandpa, Lily is blowing Jimmy Norton.  I won't have it.  I won't, I won't, I won't.  Lily?  Yes.  That's a sexy name.  It sure is.  1930.  Lily, how's Mildred and Beatrice?  Yeah, well, don't go by the name, baby.  No, I won't.  She is sexy.  You don't go by the fact that you blew Jimmy and not even want to have anything to do with  you.  Here's what happened. 
[02:00:00]  Lily called me a little while ago and said that she was trying to call for whatever reason.  Hours.  Okay, for hours, and Danny was probably, or somebody was going, no.  What happened when you were calling in?  Well, I said I wanted to say happy birthday to you, and I'm, you know, all night, it's,  you know, Arizona time, blah, blah, blah.  Anyway, I had other things to say, but I don't even fucking remember what they are  now.  Wow.  But I did want the world to know, and happy birthday, Jimmy, that the fancy man has skin 
[02:00:30]  as soft as a baby, and that he is extremely clean.  He's making a dress out of it.  He's extremely what?  He's as clean as he said he was.  Yeah, on the outside, maybe.  And please, and Jimmy, please tell them that I am not some, like, scab-covered...  Drunk whore.  ...danky whore.  Well, here's what Lily is.  No scabs.  Lily's a psychopath. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, really?  She's nuts, but she's really sexy.  Yeah?  She came in the cellar one night, we're all sitting up there talking, and I'm just kind  of joking, I'm like, hey, come here, sit on my lap.  And she did.  She sat on my lap, and I was getting a rod.  So you knew right there.  Yeah, but she's really sexy.  Yeah?  And we went home, and we were just talking, and all of a sudden, my penis was out, and  who knows what happened.  Do you go like, oh, Lily, Lily, ugh.  I think I, didn't I call you Lil?  Oh, Hildegard.  Everyone from New Jersey calls me Lil. 
[02:01:30]  Every from, everyone from New Jersey.  Lil?  Lil?  Yes.  It's old Lil.  There should be a honky-tonk piano playing behind you with a name like Lil.  I remember Lil when I was in Kansas City.  A little ragtime behind you.  Oh, Lil, it's good to see you again.  There's got to be an Ebenezer around.  Yeah, I know.  Ebenezer.  Sounds like an old whore.  Lil.  That's why I don't go by it.  It does sound like an old whore name.  I saw Lil up above the saloon one day when the stage brought me into Kansas City. 
[02:02:00]  I used to fuck Lil and she died a rickets.  Lil?  Thank you so much.  Lil, walk us through the BJ.  Oh, um.  It was hard because you had the consumption at the time.  You remember I was at the table just carving some scrimshaw?  You want me to walk you through it?  Yeah.  Yeah, let's go.  My God, I've been on the phone so long.  Okay, um, well, we obviously, um, took a liking to each other quickly. 
[02:02:30]  He had a penis and you had a mouth.  It's like love connection.  Yeah.  Took a liking to each other.  All right, whatever.  No, we're we're...  I know that he pays for it and he talks about never getting, uh, another girl that's been with  him once to be with him again and all this self-deprecating shit, but I liked him and,  you know, whatever, I'm psychotic.  Anyway, um...  Did you have regular sex? 
[02:03:00]  No.  No, no.  So...  Look, Jimmy just says it like, no, no, no, no.  Why would I want to, like, satisfy her in any way possible?  Like, that was his face.  I know, exactly.  I go, do you have regular sex?  He goes, no, no, no.  It was our first date.  You're going to report that to the government?  No, no, no, no.  Why would you do that?  Why?  It was our first date, so I was going to...  You're calling it a date.  Date?  Yeah.  I'm joking.  A first date where you go home with a load in your mouth.  That's different than candy and flowers.  It's more like a gig.  You're the one who wants to bring home to mommy. 
[02:03:30]  My fucking, uh, comedian groupie, whatever.  Anyway, so, Jimmy pretended that he had to get something at his place and we were just  going to stop for a minute and I knew the whole thing was bullshit.  What a gimmick.  I had to get something.  Yeah, a blowjob.  Yeah, there was a bunch of seed in my bag that I had to empty.  She's gone, I swear.  Look, I didn't know how it was there.  I hope you didn't do it.  She hung up?  Do we have her number?  Was she angry?  No, she...  She had to show her back.  I don't know.  She had a dick to suck. 
[02:04:00]  I got a dick on the other line.  So, all of a sudden, ding dong, got to go click.  Uh, Diamond Dave?  Excuse me, Bob.  Dave, why don't you do...  It must just be like living in paradise.  Dave, why don't you pay attention to doing your own show?  There's a lot banking on you.  That's right.  Skippity-boo-ba-boo, Jackie Rose.  That's the worst.  Dave, get back to your show. 
[02:04:30]  How many commercials have you run so far, this break?  50.  50 this break?  So, you've had plenty of time to call up other radio shows?  I like your show better.  Than his own.  Skippity-boo-ba-boo.  All right, Lily's back.  But first, love pudding.  Love pudding.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, I was just curious.  If her and Jimmy got married, would her name be Lil' Jimmy Norton?  Lil' Norton.  Lil' blows Lil'.  Call me crazy, but she doesn't seem the marrying type. 
[02:05:00]  Lily.  Oh, she's perfect.  Yeah, I don't know what happened, but...  Oh, Lil'.  I think the Indians took down the telegraph wires.  It's what happened.  They'll do that every now and then.  That was that boil on the side of her cheek from the 1800s.  Hey, hey, now.  Whatever.  He has witnesses.  I'm not...  All right, listen.  So, what was the excuse Jimmy used to get you back to his place?  Well, he did have to get something.  What was the something? 
[02:05:30]  AZT.  I don't know.  I, you know, like, um...  I don't know.  Me.  Nothing.  I had to get a pen.  Nothing.  Yeah, it was something like that.  I had to go get a penny.  Something ridiculous.  Right.  It wasn't even a good excuse.  But he thought that I really thought that that was, you know, and then he was just going  to drop me off.  And I knew.  I knew.  No, remember I told you I had to go back home real quick because I was dropping her off,  but I needed tissues and a nickel.  I know.  Right.  So, I'm like, let's go.  We're just going to be there for a minute and all this stuff.  Yeah.  And I knew. 
[02:06:00]  It's because, you know, I'm not...  I'm from back east, so I'm not stupid.  I'm not...  So, how do you get things rolling?  Would he just pull it out and go, hey, look what's here?  Well, no.  I was getting a tour of the place, and the bedroom was really nice, and the view was really nice,  and I like beds.  Jimmy's moves, man.  So, oh, yours too, though.  You sat on the bed?  Yeah, I laid down on the bed, took my boots off, and got comfortable, and one thing led 
[02:06:30]  to another.  That's pretty much a good signal.  Well, that's a good subtle way to say...  Well, the girl...  You're going to get some action.  Lays down, slash passes out briefly.  On your bed.  And he wanted to assess, you know, my equipment, and because, you know, it's like, well, is  it really big, or is it really little, or is it...  Oh, no, I can tell.  Jimmy, what was it?  It was my jeans.  I think we decided it was a medium.  It was nice, yeah.  But, Jimmy, I have to tell you that I have done the shaving thing. 
[02:07:00]  Oh, cool.  Yeah.  You recommended that she shaves?  Well, she wouldn't.  She was...  You're a real prick.  No, no, she wouldn't let me...  I'm not going to fuck you, blow me, and your pussy's a mess.  Did you tell her after your load was in her throat?  No, I said something about, look, I can't tell if that's your vagina or if Stavros from  Kojak is in your underpants.  Hold on.  Let us all enjoy that 1974 reference.  Crocker, look at this mess. 
[02:07:30]  No, it was...  Actually, it was very nice, but she wouldn't let me go down on it, because she's like,  no, I'm not...  She was, like, really, like, not...  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Being a girl.  Yeah.  That's our kind of respect.  Really fast, Paulie in Chicago.  I don't want to lose him.  Paulie, go ahead.  Paulie.  Yes, I was just thinking, we can get all the women that have blown Jimmy over the years,  we can get them together for one of those, we all have AIDS photos, too.  Punching up.  Oh, sorry.  He gets tested, and I got tested.  Is your right answer?  I'm sure you did.  Smart move, Lil. 
[02:08:00]  As soon as the plane landed, there's a home kid waiting for you.  Yeah, and a robe.  Whatever.  Yeah.  Well, the whole thing is how Jimmy's always having to pay for it, and I just wanted the world  to know that fancy men can get a girl that's not a total pig's gank, and maybe a whore,  but not a pig's gank.  Is Jimmy packing? 
[02:08:30]  He's got a beautiful penis.  That's the worst description of a cock I've ever heard.  Beautiful.  Oh, I like it.  Yeah.  What is it?  What's beautiful about it?  The sun is rising up over the head.  It's just beautiful.  It's delightful, it's delicious, it's still lovely.  It's got like a Mona Lisa smile.  Is that gay enough for you?  Yeah.  That's that knowing HIV smile.  It's a fucking man load.  What can I tell you?  He's a fucking mule. 
[02:09:00]  Did he do anything for you?  Anything.  Yes, he did.  What?  What did he do?  He gave me a hearty handshake.  That's right.  And I let her leave alive.  That's great.  And he didn't make me take a taxi home.  Oh, did I drop you off?  Yeah, you did.  See?  Wow.  I know.  What a gentleman.  That's love.  Anyway, when I'm back in New York, I'll let you know.  And when you're out in L.A. or whatever.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right.  Anyway, happy birthday.  And I love the show. 
[02:09:30]  I pay for it.  I don't give a shit.  But I pay for satellite anyway, so it's thrown in.  Wow.  That's what happened.  Wow.  That's nice.  Yeah, that's filled me up a little.  It's not much, but a little bit.  I gave her nothing.  Let's play a little song for Lily.  You have AIDS.  Yes, you have AIDS.  I hate to tell you, boy, that you have AIDS.  You've got the AIDS.  You may have caught it when you stuck that filthy needle in here. 
[02:10:00]  Well.  Or maybe all that unprotected sex, but you hear.  It isn't clear, but what we're certain of is you have AIDS.  Yes, you have AIDS.  Not HIV, but full-blown AIDS.  Be sure that you see that this is not HIV.  Part full-blown AIDS.  Not HIV, but really full-blown AIDS. 
[02:10:30]  I'm sorry.  I wish it was something less serious.  Part full-blown AIDS, you've got the AIDS.  There you go.  What a happy tune that is.  Yeah.  Informative.  You have AIDS.  Yes, you have AIDS.  It's fantastic.  Psycho.  Yes.  What's up?  I was curious whether Mr. Bill Burr had to make the beeline for Detroit last week to Livonia. 
[02:11:00]  Remember the panic that you had?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  No.  I think they fucked up.  Yeah?  Because I'm not.  Yeah.  It's still not quite.  Well, I don't know.  They didn't really give me any status.  Hey, what happened yesterday?  Yeah.  And there wasn't any.  They didn't mess with my money or anything.  They weren't pissed.  Yeah.  All right.  Then it's their fault.  Yeah, that's what I thought.  Fuck them.  How was New Year's in Livonia?  Oh, that was great.  Yeah.  Handed out the noisemakers.  Ten minutes left of my set. 
[02:11:30]  That's got to be a treat for a comic, man.  That has got to be a treat.  You're in the middle of your set, and you see them coming out.  Oh, it was already a nightmare.  My, you know, like, you know.  Come on.  Tell some jokes.  Yeah.  Okay, come on.  Settle down.  Settle down.  Yeah, if you could just wait, wait.  To blow those until later.  Fucking kill me.  That was the last ten minutes. 
[02:12:00]  Great.  Well, they always do it at the worst time.  Like, if you have your, uh, I think you'll know when to do it.  This is when they do it, these fucking dummies.  Two Jews walk into a bar.  Ah!  Ah!  This guy sucks.  Right.  Come on.  Five, four, three.  Oh.  I hate the clubs that hand out the checks with ten minutes left in the act.  That is the worst thing ever.  Jimmy likes that.  Club owners out there.  Jimmy loves when the checks come. 
[02:12:30]  Especially because, you know, in a lot of cases, the last ten minutes of someone's act  is really, really strong, and they're going to try to wrap it up.  Yeah.  And they're handing out checks, and now people are like, well, I had one daiquiri, and you  had the way in that.  How many did you have?  Are we going to split this?  Anyone have a calculator?  Or, but I didn't have the appetizer.  Ah, it's fantastic.  They at least now do sections of the room.  Back in the day, they would just drop them across the whole room.  I get so frustrated by that.  You go from killing to just, it's like you're some crazy guy in a bus station, just up there  talking, everybody walking by. 
[02:13:00]  They're disinterested.  You see their faces looking into the fucking table.  It's enraged.  It's the worst.  How many clubs are the only places that could get away with everything they do?  They pack you in with people you have no clue who they are.  You're sitting closer to them than you would sit with family.  At tables, you don't know.  There's a drunk across from you.  But they charge you a lot of money to sit with people that are usually very distracting,  annoying, and drunk.  Where else are you going to do that?  Stress Factory doesn't drop checks on the comics. 
[02:13:30]  Some clubs still don't do it.  They do it right.  But the comedy clubs have this fucking thinking, well, we don't want the last thing they do.  We want the last thing they do to laugh instead of being handed a check.  It's like, what's the way it is in life, shithead?  You go out, you pay at the end of the night, and you fucking go home.  That's the way it is.  They just don't want to get beat on the checks.  They're lying.  That's what their motives are.  They don't want to get beat.  Really?  Yeah.  They're afraid you're going to run out on the check.  And they want to turn the room over.  Well, they want to turn the room to get that third show on a Saturday night.  It's like selling us out, either.  They do four shows on a Saturday.  They don't drop checks on comics. 
[02:14:00]  Bill Burr is going to be at Caroline's?  Yeah.  January 5th through the 8th.  Thursday through Sunday.  This week?  Yes.  This weekend.  I have all the right dates.  You can call 212-757-4100.  Who are you with, sweetie?  Do you know?  No, I don't.  Hey, a good friend of the show is calling from his hospital bed.  Oh!  God, I hope it's Voss.  For the first time after major, major surgery, it's Big Kev, everyone.  What's up, guys?  Hi, Kevin.  Big Kev.  How are you?  Very good.  You're in the hospital still? 
[02:14:30]  I am going to be here probably for a couple more days.  Are you sedated?  I am extraordinarily sedated.  What have they got you on?  I'm on the Oxy and the Percocet.  Morphine drip?  No, no morphine.  Morphine's great.  Why don't you explain to everyone what surgery you had?  I had a...  Well, let's just say it's now Big Kathy. 
[02:15:00]  That's it.  That's what the surgery was.  That's it.  I finally realized my dream.  You were a woman trapped in a man's body.  Yeah.  Now, you know.  Now you don't have a penis.  Congratulations.  Big Kev, what was the surgery?  I can see it a lot clearer now.  Ah.  Oh, wow.  What did they do?  I had some excess abdominal skin from all my weight loss.  Yeah. 
[02:15:30]  And in the abdomen region.  And they have removed it.  He's all fucked up.  They removed it.  Removed it.  So because you lost so much weight, because you had some gastric surgery a couple of years ago,  you had the excess skin that they then had to cut away.  Yes, they had to cut it away.  How do they do that?  I had this division with them just kind of crunching all this fat and then just snipping  it around the whole body. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah, that's kind of probably not far off, Jim.  That is Jim.  Well, what do they do?  He sounds like a jazz musician.  Yeah.  Yo, man, let me tell you.  What do they do?  How do they do it?  They cut me from about, I'm going to say maybe three inches from my spine all the way  around the front to three inches from my spine on the other side.  So it's a big circle cut around you. 
[02:16:30]  There's about five or six inches on my back that isn't cut at this moment.  Uh-huh.  And then what do they do?  So they make that cut, and then they cut under the excess skin area, and they remove that,  and then join the other two pieces together.  Oh, wow.  Do you still have a navel?  I do have a navel.  They thought I was going to lose it, but they managed to save my navel.  Oh, thank you, Mitch Hedberg. 
[02:17:00]  Wow.  And Kev did call me and said there were some complications the other night.  There sure was.  He had some bleeding.  I had my surgery on Thursday, and on Friday night I started getting real lightheaded and  real weak, and they started watching my blood pressure drop and drop and drop.  At the lowest, my blood pressure was 40 over 14. 
[02:17:30]  Wow.  Is that low?  Yeah, that means nothing to me.  That is none pressure.  That is, yeah, pretty bad.  In fact, they decided they had to go in because they had found a bleeder, an artery that had  popped open inside me that was bleeding.  And they had to go back in, reopen up everything they had already done, and go back in and find  the bleeder.  But the problem was is that I was so far gone already that they couldn't stabilize me for 
[02:18:00]  surgery.  So they had to do all the stabilization during the surgery, and they knew it was going to  be very dangerous.  So they sent the priest in.  They sent in the priest.  Yeah, I got to talk to you.  To touch you?  Look, I don't think he's even going to remember this.  Quick, suck this before he dies.  Why send a priest in?  Send a stripper in.  He sent the priest in, and he asked me if I wanted to discuss anything or confess anything 
[02:18:30]  before the surgery because it was a very dangerous undertaking and so forth.  Hey, there's a medic on the line.  Medic, New York City, go.  What's up, boys?  Just so you can put some relevance to it, Ted was probably near death.  40 over 14 is nothing.  That is, I mean, little babies have higher blood pressures than that.  Yeah, it was nothing.  Yeah, you sound fucked up, boy. 
[02:19:00]  That's about all I have.  Goodbye.  Bye.  Thanks for that medical insight.  Yeah, wow.  They had to put eight units.  I lost confidence.  They had to put eight units of blood in me during the surgery.  Uh-oh.  Which is a lot of blood.  They didn't get that from Haiti, did they?  Fresh Haitian blood.  How are you feeling, Kevin Ash?  Little Kevin White.  Before I had the surgery, I had to give blood to myself. 
[02:19:30]  They thought, one unit, that will be fine, and they used up that unit during my first surgery.  So when the second surgery came around, I don't know whose blood I got in here.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Could be some mongrel blood.  That's true.  How much skin did they cut away?  How many pounds?  Ready?  Are you sitting down?  Oh, boy.  About 40.  40 pounds of skin?  About 40.  It was removed from Big Kev's body. 
[02:20:00]  40 pounds of overall matter.  Can we hire it as our producer?  Yeah, can you put a messy wig on it?  No, but that's funny.  Fashion a huge hog out of some of the leftover meat.  That's funny that you bring up Ben, because I have, because I'm not getting up and moving around,  and the fluids that are running around my body are finding places to pool.  One of the places they found a pool is my nuts. 
[02:20:30]  So my sack is humongous and swollen.  Ew.  Your balls are filled with blood?  No, just like bodily, all different kinds of bodily fluids.  Lymphatic fluids and...  Yeah, yeah.  And, you know, like IV fluid, and it's all looking for a place to hang out, and it...  Hang out.  Let's all meet at the balls.  I've got to stop off the knee.  I'll meet at the cockhead for 20 minutes, so we're going to segue into the balls for a little while.  We'll all just meet up at the balls. 
[02:21:00]  Water on the brain, water on the knee.  Fuck is, we'll all hang out in his nutsack.  Yeah, we'll leave through the tip and wind up on Eric's back.  Sorry, Eric.  If we get lost, meet at the balls.  Yeah.  You all know where the balls are, right?  You all know?  Not to mention the fact that I got one of those catheters in there.  Oh, God.  I'd rather have 10 more surgeries than have a catheter back in there, or taken out for that matter.  Oh.  Yeah, it's just the most painful thing there is. 
[02:21:30]  When are you getting out of the hospital?  I don't know.  We're still having a problem that my blood stats aren't really great still, and I have four drains that are sticking out of my surgical area,  and two of them are really still pumping out a lot of red, tainted, blood-ish-type fluid, and my blood level isn't stable, so I may not be out of the woods.  Oh, no.  This is the last phone call from Big Cap.  Oh, Jesus. 
[02:22:00]  And I forgot my toothbrush, and I have food hanging between my teeth.  Your mom's box.  No, don't say your mom's box.  No!  Opie!  He said your mom's box.  Did you hang up on a guy who's got fucking 40 over 14 blood pressure in the hospital?  Oh, my God.  And he said your mom's box.  And Opie hung up on him.  I know.  Because he said your mom's box.  See, there's bloody oatmeal pouring out of his stomach, and you fucking clicked off on him.  Out of drains.  Ugh.  Ah, let's go to Joe. 
[02:22:30]  A drain.  Oh, West Side Highway stomach.  Joe in Jersey.  Joe.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I just want to congratulate Big Cap.  That was probably his most exciting phone call yet.  Big Cap.  Hey.  Well, you said your mom's box.  I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have hung up on you.  Yeah, no, no, your mom's box.  I said it as a joke.  I sent around your mom's box text messages the day of my surgery.  Let me tell you about your mom's box text messages.  Someone was very annoyed by your mom's box text message.  Who?  Who would you think would be annoyed by that in the studio? 
[02:23:00]  I don't know.  Well, who would you guess there, Big Cap?  Ben.  No.  What time did you send the messages?  Listen to this story.  And Ant's telling this one like he's looking for our sympathy.  All right.  No, I never brought it up to Kev because it passed.  Oh, what did I do to you now, Anthony?  Kev, what time did you send out the text messages?  I have no idea.  I was already on drugs when I sent it.  I understand.  I'll tell you.  It was 5 a.m. 
[02:23:30]  Okay.  That I got my text message.  I'm looking at one.  This is from Erock's phone.  My phone?  Mom's box, 5.01 a.m., 12.29.05.  So my phone, which is in my bedroom, is on the charger.  And it goes off, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, for a text message.  I don't have to be up until 5.15.  Oh, I'm sorry.  So that was 15 minutes of sleep.  He's not making a bit for the radio, by the way.  That I didn't get.  He's telling the story in the office and looking at us like, you guys understand, don't you? 
[02:24:00]  That I didn't get because, again, I've reached the point in my life, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.  It's all about me.  I'm very sorry.  Why don't you have your phone shut off then?  Because I leave it.  Because God forbid an emergency.  Yeah.  Like a friend who might die on the fucking surgery?  Yeah.  Something like that.  What kind of emergency do you consider?  All right.  Yeah.  That could be considered an emergency.  That surgery was seven and a half hours long.  Seven and a half hours and you wanted to sleep 15 more minutes. 
[02:24:30]  It could have been.  That's a very important 15 minutes, the last 15.  It really sets my day.  No one even wants to comment.  We don't know what to say.  I know.  All right.  What if I was sick?  I wouldn't.  Yeah.  All right.  Okay.  He was feeling nervous and he was reaching out.  Right.  To the people he thought were his friends.  I'll admit then I shouldn't have told anybody that I was that upset.  That was insincere.  All right, Anthony. 
[02:25:00]  What if one of your important friends like Jimmy was sick?  Oh, important friends.  What do you mean, what if?  I have no important friends.  I have acquaintances and workmates.  And you're a chef.  Seth.  Hey.  That's it.  All right.  I'll tell you this.  Big Kev.  Big Kev.  That's it.  I will remember you.  Uh-oh.  All right.  This is how I get my own best of show. 
[02:25:30]  Will you remember me?  I don't think his condition presently warrants this song.  Don't let your life pass.  He's still here.  At least play the cancer song.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We'll play the cancer.  You got that fucking fat Hawaiian with his...  Yeah.  This one, you're definitely gone.  He's still on the phone, for God's sake.  Or we play the Hulk music.  There is that chance I have to have more dangerous surgery.  So, by all means, let's make fun of it.  No, that's...  Oh, my God. 
[02:26:00]  This isn't right.  Yeah.  The sad cancer music for Big Kev today.  He's not cancer.  He's getting...  He's got his skin removed.  You're going to be all right, right?  I don't know.  Oh, that's the key. 
[02:26:30]  Is there a chance that something really bad could happen?  Yes.  There's a very...  I almost died on Saturday, and...  Yeah, I'll just...  I'll just say, yeah, there's still a chance.  Oh.  But, uh...  Best doctors working on you?  The doctors are...  They're doing their best. 
[02:27:00]  Hey, who carries out all that flesh?  That 40 pounds?  I don't know.  I presume it goes in a waste area.  I had to sign away my rights to it.  You have rights to it?  Yeah.  In a jar?  Yeah, I...  Give it to that lunatic down in fucking D.C.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Rich women are going to be using it as face cream in a few years.  Collagen implants.  Right.  Your fucking upper ass fat is going to be in some fucking rich lady's face. 
[02:27:30]  Her cheeks.  They're shipping it off to Hollywood as we speak with her high cheekbones and a nice chin line  with this taint.  Her husband...  Her husband will kiss her face and all of a sudden go, how come you can't get good guests?  I don't know what that means.  Hey, at least I get guests.  I know.  You're a good one.  Don't upset him.  He's in a delicate condition.  That's right.  I'm sorry.  You got a Shatner, for God's sake.  You're right.  Come on.  How about Twitchell's?  That's right.  Twitchell's. 
[02:28:00]  That's right.  One of Big Kev's finds.  Not that you won't be around, but where is your book with potential guests, you know,  just in case?  I've taken care of all of that.  All right.  All right, Big Kev.  Anything else you want to say?  No, I just wanted to say hi, and I wanted to thank everybody that's been calling and  coming to visit me and sending well witches.  All right.  Where can they get a hold of you?  Where can they get a hold of me?  I'm not giving out my number.  Are you insane?  Very smart.  All right.  Good luck, bro.  Our listeners are animals. 
[02:28:30]  Thank you.  Oh, jeez.  Don't give him a good luck, bro.  See you soon, man.  All right.  I mean, I'm not going to probably thank you this week, so I'm going to be in Vegas.  But, I mean, after Vegas, I'll probably thank you when I'm in L.A.  All right.  Thanks, Jamie.  Best of luck and get well soon, Big Kev.  All right.  Take care.  Bye, sweetie.  All right.  There he goes.  Big Kev.  Greg in California.  Greg?  Yeah.  Hey, good morning.  Thoughts and prayers to a big guy.  Listen, I want to thank him very much for waiting to make this phone call. 
[02:29:00]  Right about the time we're thinking about having breakfast out here in California.  I really appreciate it.  It's good breakfast talk.  Oh, the drain part?  Yeah.  Yeah, all of it.  All of it.  Taking about 40 pounds of whatever you called it matter.  Right.  Bloody oatmeal.  That is the perfect description.  Yeah.  Got to go find a bowl now.  Thanks, guys.  Punching out.  All right.  Just thick, unused mass.  Viscous.  Viscous.  All right.  Bill Byrne's studio.  He's playing Carolines all this weekend starting Thursday night. 
[02:29:30]  212-757-4100.  We got to play the Wizard of Oz stuff.  Yes.  Let's get to that next.  We'll get to that next.  Oh, you almost pointed.  Ooh.  Then you did point.  There's a paper towel.  All right.  There right there.  All right.  Here we go.  I got a break.  I got a break.  Oh, this is nice.  Oh, you're all right.  This is a story about a man. 
[02:30:00]  He always was so lonely at night.  But his voice was rowdy.  You could hear it all through his train station.  And I'm going to sing this one.  This is about Zippy Toe Tommy.  Let's go.  Oh, we go.  Oh, we go.  Oh, we go.  You played that night.  Every night I know you have to go.  My money's gone and off for all my friends. 
[02:30:30]  And the cop says to me,  Hey, you smell bad.  Get out of here.  And he says,  And you don't have an angel.  And he says,  That ain't you.  Shelter me from the falling rain.  This is my life.  I'm living with so much pain. 
[02:31:00]  Shelter me from the falling rain.  You have homes.  This is my life.  I'm living with so much pain.  And just a little peace.  Let's go to Mike real fast in Middletown. 
[02:31:30]  Mike, what's going on, man?  How we doing, guys?  All right.  Welcome back.  Welcome back.  We've been here a year and three months, I think.  Well, I just got my ex-everody. 
[02:32:00]  Holy shit.  Do you know what you missed?  Now we've got to do it.  I know what I missed.  And I'm testing it on bits and bits here and here.  All right.  Well, the show started about a year and three months ago with us talking about the St.  Pat's thing.  That lasted about two or three days.  Then after that, we started to bring in naked girls to do crazy stuff.  Of course.  And then there was the time that some girl got in a lot of trouble and she was drunk and  naked outside on the sidewalk.  And then what happened, Anthony? 
[02:32:30]  What happened, huh?  Like, making jokes and stuff.  And then John Valby came by and he played a few of his dirty songs.  On the piano downstairs.  Downstairs in the very famous Steinway shop.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I'll be catching up to you.  I just got it.  Mike, why did it take you so long to get XM?  Why?  Why?  Why?  I don't know.  I just, my girlfriend bought it for me for Christmas.  You still believed in free radio, didn't you?  You wouldn't believe how much I miss you guys.  How much did you miss us?  So much, dude. 
[02:33:00]  I want to talk to that whack bag, uh, uh, Norton over there.  I'm right here, sir.  What's up, Norton?  Heard you a few times on XM, uh, when I got it the first day.  I'm deeming this call completely unnecessary.  All right.  To this program.  There you go.  He missed you guys so much he never bought a unit.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  I really missed you guys.  You're great.  Fucking year and a half we're sitting here.  Rotten.  Where are you?  Let's say hi to Nick.  Nick Schwartzen.  Nicholas.  Hi, everybody.  Hi.  Hi. 
[02:33:30]  Good morning.  Hi.  Good.  What's up, Mornay?  What's going on?  Nick is our friend.  I understand that.  He knows everybody around here.  He's one of the guys.  Very, very funny.  One of the successful guys.  Yeah.  Oh.  Much better than some of us.  Some of the guys have moved to L.A. and actually shit happened for him.  Oh, really?  Congratulations.  Thank you, Brett.  I mean, you know, we'll see what happens.  I don't know.  I could fucking die at all.  Ah, tight to the vest.  I like that.  Hey, hey, you never know.  You do stuff with Adam Sandler, right? 
[02:34:00]  Yeah, I worked with Adam for the last couple of years.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Woo-hoo.  It's so hard for me not to do that whenever I'm around him.  He does not like it, but whenever I'm in the office, I'm like, you have to eat turkey.  He's like, yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  All right.  I said that years ago.  Knock it off.  Well, that keeps things in perspective, though.  You know, when you're feeling successful and stuff, then you look at him and it kind of makes you feel like a piece of shit.  Yeah.  Quite frankly, if you're talking about comics being successful, he's one that kind of really... 
[02:34:30]  He is the top of the top.  Yeah.  Dude, he's got to be making a million, million and a half bucks a year.  Jim could be a couple more than that.  Tag never gets old.  Yeah, no, he's ginormous.  He shares it with all of his good, close friends.  Yeah, no, he's amazing.  He's like the most loyal, great guy.  He's awesome.  Really cool.  Yeah.  Good.  Have him call the show.  I will.  We talked to him a few years back. 
[02:35:00]  Haven't talked to him since.  Oh, way before the, you know, multi-million dollar movie.  We always talk to these guys on their way up and then on their way down.  I think when we talk to him, we talk about what was it like working with Colin Quinn on remote control.  That's hilarious.  And that was pretty much it.  Yeah.  And then all of a sudden he had a couple movies that a lot of people saw.  Stardom.  Right.  Comedy film stardom.  Yeah, we like to be awkward, like on the radio or not.  Maybe I can be one of his...  Maybe you can be the new you-can-do-it guy.  We have to see.  Thanks, Nick.  That was easy. 
[02:35:30]  Well, Nick, hang with us.  We'll get into some of the things you're doing, but we also have to play this yellow brick road.  Or people are going to kill us.  Before anything, though.  It's the new year.  I'm starting something new.  We're very charitable people here on this program.  We are?  Nice.  And, yeah.  All right.  And I just want...  I've been looking for a charity.  And I'm serious.  Is there anybody in your family that has any mental disabilities that you would like money  given to?  Any type of... 
[02:36:00]  My uncle's kind of retarded.  Really?  But, like, really?  Or...  No, seriously.  Like, he has...  Oh, you might not want to...  He has a mental problem.  My uncle Steve...  You might want to come back another day, then.  Yeah.  It's the next hour.  Wait.  We have a retarded Steve here, too.  Right.  See?  What are you getting at, Anthony?  Well, that's the whole new angle this year.  It's not making so many people uncomfortable.  Oh, I see.  Remember who was in here that day, and we were going off, and they didn't say a word, and  we were going off about some retarded show.  Oh, that was Vinny. 
[02:36:30]  Right.  Vinny Branch.  How uncomfortable is that?  I like now getting these things out in the clear, so I'm going to use my charity ruse every  time.  He had a...  I didn't.  He wasn't supposed to.  He was supposed to go, no, I don't give a shit about fucking retards, and then we roll  and all laugh about the yellow brick road.  But I didn't...  But now there's going to be an uncomfortable retarded uncle.  But I would say that I was...  I had a problem with it.  I mean, like...  Oh, you don't care?  No.  Oh, okay.  He tried to stab me at a Thanksgiving.  He tried to stab you Thanksgiving?  He tried to stab me at a Thanksgiving.  Oh, okay.  All right.  So fuck him. 
[02:37:00]  That's all I'm talking about.  Going down.  Well, Anthony discovered this little thing.  Well, I saw it on Cinemax, I guess it was.  I'm not even sure.  One of those fucking things.  Maybe HBO Family.  And it was a bunch of retarded people, mentally challenged, whether they had Down Syndrome  or something else.  I don't know.  Bunch of different types of retarded conditions.  But they all were brought together, one group, to perform The Wizard of Oz in full costume 
[02:37:30]  with a director and stage hands and music and everything.  Oh, God.  And I...  Wait.  I could not take my eyes off.  Yeah.  Bill might be tapping out on retards.  I tap out on retards.  Bill taps out on retards.  Do you really?  Yeah.  Remember?  I did a bit one time on stage and I made a woman cry.  Yeah.  And that was it for you?  Yeah.  I just think I got some bad calm.  I haven't tried to have kids yet.  And I'm tapping out.  See?  That would have caused me to write more retarded material.  That's the fucking greatest thing ever. 
[02:38:00]  You know what's funny?  And his is probably the most innocent retarded joke ever.  Do you remember it?  I was making fun of that movie, I Am Sam.  I was talking about how Hollywood...  Of course we do all the time.  Yeah.  How Hollywood depicts retarded people as if they somehow accidentally have these unbelievable  insights into life and accidentally throw out these metaphors.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  And I was like, I worked with retarded kids at no point did they ever accidentally say  anything. 
[02:38:30]  Right.  And lighten you.  Right.  Yeah.  And you couldn't throw sticks on the ground.  And they're like, hey, 62.  And then you go to Vegas.  And the punchline was, if retarded people really had these skills, we wouldn't put them  in those special schools.  We'd have them working in the Pentagon.  Hey, where's the Al Qaeda going to attack next?  And you throw matches on the ground.  Hey, I think they're going to attack Disney World.  It was in front of like 18 people.  Who cried over that joke?  Well, she started flipping out.  And then I said, I'm not making fun of retarded kids.  I'm talking about Hollywood. 
[02:39:00]  Right.  Hollywood.  Yeah.  About them.  No, I was an asshole.  I should have backed off.  And then she got up.  And walked out.  It was like in front of 18 people.  So she gets up, like teared up and walked out.  And it's just awkwardness.  And I'm just standing there like, yeah, okay.  And then all of a sudden her husband finally has the balls to get up.  And then he walks out.  And then like 30 seconds later, their friend finally gets up and goes, that ain't right.  And then he fucking walks out.  No way.  Oh, it was awful.  It was awful.  It was like the whole crowd, like one at a time with like 30 second breaks, was just 
[02:39:30]  getting up and walking out.  Everyone leave.  Worst DNA first, please.  The worst is when you get hung out to dry on something where you're pointing out some  kind of flaw in Hollywood.  Yeah.  And it's taken as you goofing on retarded people.  How do you handle it?  Because believe me, this will be goofing on retarded people.  Not your fun, insightful little joke there.  Not your clever joke.  Right.  I was working Dangerfield.  There's no real handling in it.  I mean, it's not like you're going to affect your career. 
[02:40:00]  You weren't yelling, well, I was just saying, people.  18 people.  Oh, come back.  Yeah, no.  Well, it's hard to do that and then segue into, so I got a computer.  That's what I mean.  Yeah.  Did the manager have to like give them three passes?  No, they don't care there at all.  No.  Speaking of slow, I still have dial-up.  Speaking of things retarded people will never do, I got a computer.  Right.  The telling segway.  Billy, can I have my retarded uncle grant you like a retarded pardon?  Yeah.  Yeah, see? 
[02:40:30]  I don't know.  Now he's willing to hang out with a retarded uncle.  Should we do this or not?  Oh, my God.  He's got a retarded uncle.  Did I kill another one who wants to tap out?  No, bring it, dude.  Oh, you don't think the message boards would get that?  Did I kill another bit?  I mean, I already fucked over that.  Okay.  No.  I did a 9-11 benefit at the Stress Factory and...  Hey, don't you fucking talk about that.  No, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.  That we won't fucking talk about.  I'm as red, white, and blue as they come.  No, I got a...  And I did a retarded joke, and it was up on these retarded message boards. 
[02:41:00]  People who have retarded family...  If I find the thread, I'll bring it in.  We can print it.  But it was really...  Retarded message boards, and by that you mean whackbag.com?  No.  No?  Oh, okay.  I think he's not doing good on the show.  When he comes back...  Hey!  Fucking cunts.  Not whackbag.  The other one whose name I'm not mentioned.  I like ice cream.  No, this is about people who have retarded kids.  They were really fucking upset, and one woman actually, who baby's retarded kids, who I  used to fool around with in my car, actually defended me.  You know what? 
[02:41:30]  No!  Oh, Jesus Christ, you just crumbled up the bit.  What's wrong with everybody?  Well, we gotta do it.  Do it.  Look, I'm against it.  It's the Yellow Brick Road.  Billy.  The retired production of Wizard of Oz.  Anthony found this.  Let's listen to a couple.  See if it's even worthy of, not goofing on, but discussing.  Because I'll be honest with you.  I watched a show the other day, I mentioned it, called I Have Tourette's, but Tourette's  Doesn't Have Me.  It was a show about children, junior high school age, with Tourette's syndrome. 
[02:42:00]  And I'm there, sitting in, buckled in, all ready to laugh.  I'm doing a radio show.  And it wasn't.  It was very touching, sensitive, done very well, nice.  And it didn't have any comedy value.  Good cinematography.  It was not any comedy value.  There was nothing to bring here to the show to goof on or anything.  Perhaps this is the same.  So what you're saying is we're going to have an informed discussion about the merits of  the mentally challenged doing old movie classics. 
[02:42:30]  Old classics.  Let's not jump.  Retarded classics.  Yeah.  Retarded classics.  Absolutely.  Let's start with the first track here.  Keep an open mind.  Let's be adults.  This is the Tin Man Singing.  A production of Gone With My Intelligence.  Oof, as dumb as the wind.  All right. 
[02:43:00]  The Tin Man Sings, everyone.  When a man's an empty kettle, he should be on his metal.  And yet I'm torn apart, just because I'm presuming that I could be kind of human if I only  had a heart.  Not too tender.  I'd be gentle and awful sentimental regarding love and art. 
[02:43:30]  I'd be friends with the sparrows and the boy who shoots the arrows if I only had a heart.  You know?  Yikes.  That was nice.  Bill, comment?  I'm just thinking like when you're in class, like high school, and if you laugh, you're going  to get suspended.  This should be like the Olympics of it.  Yeah, because kids would just be brutal.  Yeah, whoever does can hold out the fucking longest. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  I just want to see all the parents in the audience proudly watching this.  That's my 30-year-old.  So, so far no one's laughing yet?  No, no.  No.  So far?  I think he did a fine job.  See who's twisted.  Fine rendition.  I think the scarecrow one's going to be the hardest.  Yeah, that could be rough.  He wants a brain, yeah.  He doesn't know what he wants, and they all can relate.  Here's the teacher laying down the ground rules.  Uh-oh.  All right. 
[02:44:30]  Everyone listen up, okay?  There's a lot of work to do.  So if every time I call somebody's name, we clap for five minutes, we're not going to  have any time.  We're not going to have any time to get any work done.  That's the first thing.  The second thing is there's all different kinds of parts with all different amounts of  lines, but everyone will be on stage.  Everyone will have either a speaking line or a musical number.  Do we all understand that?  Yeah.  Okay.  No.  You know what that was? 
[02:45:00]  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  What?  Candy, candy, candy, candy, candy, candy, candy, candy, candy.  Candy, candy, puppy, puppy, kitty.  Candy, candy, shit your pants, candy, candy, candy, puppy, candy.  Oh, did you hear Bill?  Did you hear the sound he just said?  He went, he went, oh.  Oh, it's disgusting Bill Burr.  We'll take it easy.  You're right. 
[02:45:30]  You're right.  Yeah.  Now that was, yeah.  That was.  He's like, I heard Gracie's.  The best is that they're going to clap for five minutes every time a name is called.  She said don't.  She said don't, dude.  They're supportive.  They're supportive of each other.  What was in the background?  Did you hear it like that?  And then they escorted him out, I think.  Whatever it was, it wasn't the solution to a math problem.  But maybe it was and they didn't let him, you know what I mean?  He was actually yelling out something about pie and they're like, all right, shut up, stupid. 
[02:46:00]  All right, here we go.  Mom, I got the witch.  Yes, this coach.  I got it.  I did.  I got this coach.  I got the witch.  Yes.  You stuck.  Yes.  Yeah.  Mother retarded.  Somebody forgot that line.  Somebody.  Yeah. 
[02:46:30]  Who's clapping in the background?  That's my happy.  I just, I'm.  Do you have asthma too?  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know you're happy.  It's a lot of work.  I was praying for the miscult so much.  You know, I don't mind retards, but at least get the ones that can act.  This fucking retard has no motivation.  Wow.  That wasn't part of the show.  What was that?  It was the girl that got the part of the wicked witch calling her mother to tell her that she 
[02:47:00]  had gotten the part she wanted.  Oh, all right.  So she was very emotional about the fact that she had gotten the part and they, you know,  painted her up green.  What's my motivation?  To finally be included in a family photograph.  Hey, Jim, what's up?  What's up, boy? 
[02:47:30]  Hey, I just wanted to, can you say that version of somewhere over the gene pool?  Come on.  Sir, please, that's mean-spirited.  I'm sorry.  All right.  This next clip, we meet the wicked witch.  I'm Elizabeth O'Brien, and I played the wicked witch of the West.  Who killed my sister?  Who killed the wicked witch of the East?  Was it you?  No, I didn't mean to kill anyone.  It was an accident.  Well, my little pretty, I can cause accidents, too. 
[02:48:00]  Aren't you forgetting something?  That's no worse than yes, dear.  It's actually better written.  Well, there's the wicked witch.  Yeah.  Here's a very famous line.  Oh.  You're cursed, Brad.  What have you done?  Oh, God. 
[02:48:30]  I'm melting.  I'm melting.  I'm melting.  Oh, what a world.  Oh, what a world.  What could it do like you destroy my beautiful wickedness?  Oh, my gosh.  What are you doing?  Yeah, yeah.  You killed her.  That was the gold at the end.  Yeah, yeah.  That sounded like Corky.  That did sound like Corky.  A guest star, right?  A big cameo.  Yes. 
[02:49:00]  That's hilarious.  Who is, like, repeating her line?  Because that's just the witch is supposed to be saying that line.  That's the teacher probably reading her lines.  You think?  I think maybe it was Dorothy, like, not knowing she's not supposed to say that.  You ever see, like, kids in a movie sometimes or a TV show, they're actually mouthing the  words that the other person is speaking as they're doing them?  I think that's what she was kind of doing.  You got to smack around a little.  Isn't that rehearsal, though?  Is this rehearsal still?  Yeah, this is rehearsal.  Oh, maybe.  All right.  They're rehearsing.  All right.  It'll get better.  We meet the line. 
[02:49:30]  Than your show you're doing for HBO, right?  Honest to God, Louis C.K. does actually do the lines like that sometimes in rehearsal.  I'm like, what the fuck are you doing?  So it happens.  All right.  We meet the lion here.  My name is John Stare, and I'm playing the Cowardy Lion in this play.  Put him up.  Put him up.  That's not bad.  Which one of you first?  I'll fight you both together if you like.  I'll fight you with one paw tied behind my back. 
[02:50:00]  I'll fight you standing on one foot.  I'll fight you with my eyes closed.  Oh.  Pulling ass on me, eh?  That's him talking to intelligent thoughts.  Sneaking up on me, eh?  I didn't bite him.  It's my nose bleeding.  You are relentless.  Of course not.  My goodness, you're nothing but a great, big coward.  You're right.  I am a coward.  I haven't got encouraged at all. 
[02:50:30]  I even scared myself.  Well, I don't doubt that.  I'm really getting into the whole spirit of The Wizard of Oz, though.  They're doing a great job with the acting.  It isn't just, like, droning Apple.  Yeah, it's not just nonsense.  No, I'm really putting some emotions.  All right, now we meet the mayor.  Bill Burr will be at Caroline's all weekend long.  He's always here for these shows.  When are you going to realize that you always have these shows? 
[02:51:00]  Yeah, I know.  And you just don't notice until I come in.  Maybe you're right.  Here we go.  One time I kicked the ball in the dog's face, and I didn't even know I did it that day.  It ate his prime ribs.  It's in some gear.  That's it.  Did you see that, Matt?  When did you get tired?  No.  No?  It's a workout for me.  Ah, that's a little off time, I guess.  Yeah, of course.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, Joe.  I'm watching that show last night, and thanks to that show, my girlfriend thinks I'm the 
[02:51:30]  most disgusting human being on the face of this planet.  Why?  What happened?  I laughed throughout the whole thing.  I was laughing so hard I could hardly breathe, especially after the retard at the end was  saying, just don't call me late for dinner.  Yeah, that was his big joke at the end.  And then he stared off into space somewhere where he just was gone.  And they just fade to black and show the credits, and they just leave you hanging with  that nice little cliffhanger of him staring off into blankness.  That and the Wicked, the girl that played the Wicked Witch, remind me of Rosie O'Donnell 
[02:52:00]  in that movie she did.  Yeah.  You remember the Rosie O'Donnell movie where she played the every part of a woman on the  bus?  Yeah.  Well, dude, it's not bad laughing through the whole thing.  Your girlfriend should have been happy that you weren't fucking her through the entire  production.  Then you're dating a psychopath.  As you're watching it.  You're banging her, and she's talking, like, shh, I want to hear this.  Yeah, well, the problem is my girlfriend used to work with autistic people, so I guess  she was kind of sensitive about it.  And I kind of played it off like, oh, I really want to see this.  This sounds real interesting.  And then throughout the whole thing, I'm just freaking laughing my fucking ass off.  All right.  There's just something, like, uncomfortable, but you've got to kind of chuckle at some 
[02:52:30]  of the little awkward mistakes they make.  You've got to laugh a little bit.  I mean, you know.  I'm not running up.  No, that's why.  You think if I was there, I wouldn't be laughing my ass off?  Of course you would be.  That's the problem is because you're not allowed to.  Yeah.  If they would just let you, it wouldn't even be nearly as funny.  Right.  Maybe.  You didn't sound like that.  That didn't sound like that.  No, I agree with you.  I'm just saying, it's not like, we're not running up to people in wheelchairs on the street 
[02:53:00]  pointing and laughing in their face.  That would be fantastic.  After they were all by.  You're doing it very cowardly.  I am doing it very cowardly.  You're recording them.  Record, bring in, laugh, faceless microphone.  Right.  I'll agree with that.  I got no problem with it either.  Let's go to Brandon in New Jersey.  Brandon.  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey, you want a pistol license.  What's going on by the kids' moms if I only had a coat hanger?  Punch it out, buddy.  Oh, my God. 
[02:53:30]  Wow.  Oh, shit.  If I only had an HMO.  Oh.  Zagman from Wackbag.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I could drop this piece of jelly with a kick right in my belly.  Zagman.  Yes, sir.  Hey.  I didn't know how I said Stern was playing the Cowardly Lion. 
[02:54:00]  There you go.  Who?  Stern, Cowardly Lion.  Oh, who?  Who, who?  Who, who?  All right, let's play the next clip here.  Mayer says his one line in the play.  We grilled him on his one line and how he would say it.  And, you know, what the rhythm of the line would be.  And he was willing to do that, to repeat it again and again and again,  to get it right, to get it how we wanted it to be.  As mayor of the Munston City in the county of the land of Oz, 
[02:54:30]  I welcome you most legally.  As mayor of Munston City in the county of the land of Oz,  I welcome you to, I re-welcome you most legally.  You know it perfect.  I didn't want you to know that before.  A plus.  A plus.  Perfect.  So easy to get an A plus when you're in time.  Oh, my God.  All you got to do is not bite somebody's face. 
[02:55:00]  Oh, look, a star on your tongue.  Good boy.  Well, as we move on, the Tin Man and Scarecrow match wits here.  Well, I just want to say that this is quite an honor.  And I'm going to have lots of fun.  Oh, you're going to have lots of fun? 
[02:55:30]  Yeah.  What about...  Are you sure?  Yeah.  What about you, Dan?  What about me?  They just gave me the role of a scarecrow with a straw in me,  and I'm going to...  That's retarded Woody Allen.  I'm going to burn me off the fire.  I'm going to be falling apart here and there.  Falling apart.  You're falling apart even when you're not a scarecrow.  That's true.  You were falling apart in the summer,  and you're still falling apart.  Take the DNA and run. 
[02:56:00]  I like it.  Everything you always wanted to know and couldn't.  Oh, fuck it.  Retards over Broadway.  Bill's in!  Hey, whatever you can do.  Bill Burr, Caroline's always...  All in here long.  Went in Rome.  Buckles under the peer pressure.  Downs and misdemeanors.  Let's go to Chris the Trucker.  Chris, what's up? 
[02:56:30]  Hey, I was wondering how'd they get the mayor of Boston there  to play the mayor in that odd show you guys were talking about.  It sounded like Menino, didn't it?  We like it like a blue, the muscular.  Tin man needs a wheelchair.  You've told us all about this part, Anthony.  Yeah, the tin man, some black guy in silver paint  in a wheelchair being pushed by a tree.  Someone dressed as a tree to kind of cover up the fact  that he's in a wheelchair.  Yeah, I had the same reaction. 
[02:57:00]  See what I mean?  It's like a test.  It is.  To see if you can somehow hold your shit together.  Yeah, when I saw that, it was over.  Then David could give his line.  Where do we go now?  And the scarecrow can point back to the center of the cart.  Where do we go?  No, stand back.  Oh, boy.  He's getting a little unsteady.  He's getting unsteady.  Let's get...  Unsteady.  We thought, wouldn't it be great  if David could play the tin man with his crutches  and not be in the wheelchair?  And, you know, certainly he had that body form of the tin man 
[02:57:30]  and he was stiff and it was rigid  and the movement would be difficult  and that would play nicely.  But it just didn't come to be.  That's not appropriate.  I guess they wanted him on his crutches.  Like he had those braces crutches  and his legs are real stiff and stuff  and they wanted him to walk around like that.  Because he can't move them?  Yeah.  She just blatantly exploited him.  Yeah.  Right?  He walks weird  and we thought we would play into that.  He could really make an authentic walking tin man.  Well, his deformity is not only mental but physical 
[02:58:00]  so we figured we'd play with that and make it work.  We spray painted him silver.  I mean painted him silver.  All he got to do is leave that dope in a room with silver paint.  Don't put his face in it.  There's gum at the bottom.  Go ahead and enjoy it, stupid.  Dave, what's going on?  Hey, it's good to hear Club Soda Candy getting some theater work.  Yeah.  And Frank. 
[02:58:30]  Frank, what's up?  Hey, man.  Is Big A going theatrical on us or what?  Yeah, Big A in the production?  Yeah, sounds like it.  We should do our own production with Big A, Club Soda Candy.  Oh, yeah.  That's part of Laverne and Shirley.  All right.  Why the director calls the slow kids kids?  I call these kids kids  and sometimes people that don't work with me  or my personal friends say, you know,  when they come to the show,  I thought these kids were seven years old.  The way that you speak about them, 
[02:59:00]  you call them kids.  They're not kids.  They're adults.  But I kind of feel like a mom to them  and so I feel like they are my kids  and I think that we have that.  Oh, beautiful.  That was too serious.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was a little serious.  She sucks.  If you pump out that many in that mental condition,  you should probably stop fucking at one point.  It's not working out.  More from the witch. 
[02:59:30]  Curses!  She's getting close to the Emerald City.  Well, shoes are not shoes.  I'm still counting on her.  Wait a minute.  I'm still great enough.  I'm still agreeing not to counter her.  To conquer.  To conquer her.  Good.  And to Emerald City as fast as lightning.  Their feet are too fat.  They have to give her red ruby work boots.  Nick Swartzen in studio with us today. 
[03:00:00]  Participating.  Participating.  Enjoying.  Yes.  I've got to get my uncle a head shot.  Yes.  An anti-free radio commercial.  A new one?  Number three.  Number three.  Number three.  We'll take a slight break.  Also done by retards.  Done by, who did this one?  Mentally challenged.  Nathaniel and Travis?  Oh, okay.  All right.  Here we go.  Mentally challenged. 
[03:00:30]  We're playing these all day long.  The listeners are going to start making their own.  It's anti-free radio commercials.  Yeah.  This is Nathaniel for Free FM.  The following is a semi-comprehensive listing of free pleasures.  Adding to one's collection of pressed maple leaves.  An introspective constitutional through the park.  Checking your friend for a hernia.  Let go, man.  I am not coughing for you.  Free FM.  Free is gay.  Karaoke.  They lost me.  That was horrendous. 
[03:01:00]  I wanted to be there with it.  Where's Derek going?  Is he coming in here to explain?  He just walked out on the guys.  It kind of lost me.  What do you mean is it's the excitement in Than's voice that just always...  Is that what does it?  Than wasn't the embarrassing part of that fucking abomination.  It was probably the wacky, I'm going to check you for hernia.  No, you're not.  Get out of here, you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was it.  That's the whole bit.  I know.  Where Travis wrecks her with the gayness.  Yeah. 
[03:01:30]  Oh, I didn't even get that.  He wrecked it, all right.  He's the one that just wrecks her with his gay stuff.  All right, well.  That's his role in those...  That worked out nicely.  I don't like it.  No, it stinks.  It stinks and I don't like it.  All right, back to Yellow Brick Road.  Retarded production of Wizard of Oz.  We were done with that.  Miss Gulch works her line.  All right.  Mr. Gap.  Hi, my name is Gulch.  I want to see you about Dorothy.  I want to face the audience.  Oh.  Talking about a curtain.  Somebody hit the sandbag, stupid. 
[03:02:00]  I want to talk to you about Dorothy.  What, the light?  Mr. Gap.  Hi, Miss Gulch.  I want to see you about Dorothy.  What's she doing?  Well, have you seen a bite on my leg?  She bit you?  No, her dog.  Oh, she bit you a dog.  No, her dog.  No, dogs are medicine. 
[03:02:30]  I'm taking him to the sheriff and making sure he's destroyed.  Third base.  They took some liberties with the original.  Yeah, really?  They improvised.  It's fine.  Third base.  They bit your leg.  That didn't sound like that.  I mean, I guess.  Were there munchkins or?  We don't see the munchkins in this.  The munchkins were all Down syndrome.  Like, they figured they would get all Down syndrome people to play the munchkins.  No, that's offensive to midgets.  You're right.  They couldn't do that part of the show. 
[03:03:00]  Why can't you get midgets instead of retarded?  They were absolutely using various handicaps as they were exploiting them for the show.  Like, the munchkins all kind of look the same.  And Down syndrome have certain features that are similar, let's say.  And the main one.  It's kind of like Planet of the Apes.  Right.  Where the gorillas were the aggressive ones.  Yes.  The orangutans were the smart ones and the chimpanzees.  It's the same thing.  Yes.  Wait, Nick has to leave?  Why are you leaving?  What?  I don't know.  I'm getting a communique from Ben Sparks. 
[03:03:30]  Nick has to leave.  He has another interview.  I see your people are pacing out there.  Yeah, but he was here to promote his movie.  Grandma's fine.  I want to hear the rest.  How many more tracks are there?  We'll go into 11 with this.  83 tracks.  11 p.m.  Where do you have to go next, Nick?  Cold pizza.  Cold pizza.  Cold pizza.  What is that?  I think it's an ESPN morning show.  Yeah.  If I have to do it live, I look like shit.  Isn't that with, is Kane on there anymore?  We have no idea. 
[03:04:00]  I don't know where Kane was.  Well, what's Grandma's Boy all about?  She's got a plug-in for something.  It's a little rated R movie we did over at San Luis Company.  It's the first one he's ever done rated R.  And it's a completely retarded cast, I hear.  It's retarded cast.  Brilliant.  It's The Wizard of Oz.  It's pretty much.  We took, we stole the cast.  No, it's a rated R comedy with boobs and weed.  And there's a lot of stuff in it.  It's fun.  Like the classics.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's got all the good shit. 
[03:04:30]  Some gratuitous nudity.  Yeah, there's gratuitous nudity.  Yeah, it's like back to the, you know, those kind of comedies where it's, you know, just  right there.  Boobs right there.  In your face.  Weed.  Funny.  Yeah, it's good.  It's honestly, we're really excited about it.  And it's a good time.  Video games are involved.  Oh.  Boobs again.  Two more boobs.  Weed.  You were just selling the shit out of this.  Dude, I am killing it.  He knows the audience he's talking to.  I am killing it.  It's tits, video games, and drugs. 
[03:05:00]  Go see it, ONA audience.  Nice.  Number one movie in the country.  There it is.  Absolutely.  When does it come up?  It comes up Friday.  Friday, yeah.  And, no, it's good.  It's a lot of Sandler's buddies are in it.  Alan Colbert is the lead.  Peter Dante.  They're all both in a lot of his movies.  Myself.  What part do you play, Nick?  I play the best friend of Alan Colbert, the lead.  And, uh, Doris Roberts from Everybody Loves Raymond.  We signed on, like, some older ladies to play the grandmothers in the, in the, they're, like, really amazing. 
[03:05:30]  Like, Shirley Jones from the Partridge family.  Oh.  And, uh, Shirley Knight.  So, like, these, you know, we have this.  Do you hook up with any of them?  I do.  I'm not going to say who, but I do, I do hook up with one of them.  Yeah.  In the, in the movie.  Bang, Mrs. Partridge.  I'd wear Shirley Jones.  Would you?  Yeah, Doris Roberts.  No.  Dude, Shirley Jones, she's got, I mean, it's good.  She's a classy broad, is what they call, call her.  I touch the boob.  You did?  Yeah. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah, I did.  You got some, had some light in it.  Partridge.  Still had a pulse.  Still had a pulse.  That's good.  No, it's a fun movie, I'm telling you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Premier's Friday?  I wouldn't say it if it weren't, believe me.  Ben's raw ass.  Ben's raw ass.  Hey, I want to know where the part is where they sing.  We represent what should have been killed, what should have been killed, what should  have been killed.  Sir, there might have been a better way to phrase that.  Yes, you've got it.  That was a little harsh, even for the show. 
[03:06:30]  Too far.  All right, we'll take a break.  We'll say goodbye to Nick.  He doesn't want to leave, but he has to leave.  I'm sorry I have to go, Nick.  I know, I'm sorry.  I hate to go.  And this isn't a, they're telling us you have to go.  No, not at all.  Absolutely not.  No, because sometimes we have to pull out the, they're telling us you've got to go.  Oh, really?  You know, when things aren't quite going well.  And the guest is like, no, I don't.  Like when Ed Asner was here, and we, fucking Ed Asner in L.A., we were all starstruck,  and he says, Ben comes over and signals, and Ed Asner goes, what was that?  And Ope goes, well, that's what Ben does when the guest is boring, to fucking Ed Asner. 
[03:07:00]  Ed Asner.  I've never hated this program more.  A classic.  Oh, Mike, what did he do?  He was hurt.  Oh, he unloaded.  Oh, he called, what, he basically called you a pariah?  He hated his guts.  He called me the destroyer.  The destroyer, yes.  The destroyer.  The destroyer.  No way.  So he was hip to it, and he freaked out.  Oh, yeah, he wasn't happy.  He kissed me on the cheek.  He kissed Voss on the cheek.  Yeah.  And he said that Ope was a fucking, like, a white wasp.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, that's right.  It was great.  Wow.  Do we have a clip of that?  And then he got home and got a disease from Voss's cheek. 
[03:07:30]  Oh, it's amazing.  He looks really like the kind of guy who could just, you know, squeeze you to death.  He is ultra-lap.  It was one of the most uncomfortable moments.  He is severe, like, liberal.  But he's such a sweet guy.  We don't have that clip anymore.  We don't need to hurt Lou Grant.  And Ope was coming off like a real douchebag to him.  No.  No, I'm hard to believe.  And he just, yeah, unloaded on him.  Well, he was boring.  I wasn't there.  I was in poker at the time.  I'm sure I could have smoothed it all over.  Ope, the heartless point guard.  Let's say hi to him.  It was a good cop, bad cop when the good cop was away. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah, it was basically Ed Asner and Justin Volpe.  Gangsta fag.  Don't nobody move to the fag man.  What's up, baby?  What's up, gangsta fag?  This really is?  Happy motherfucking New Year's, baby.  How was your New Year's, man?  What's up, man?  Check it out.  I got some good news, man.  Three pieces of good news.  One, I'm back in the motherfucking studio, baby.  I'm going to be working on a new CD.  But I don't have a title for it, so I'm holding a contest to find out who can come up with  a good name for it. 
[03:08:30]  Black cock up the ass.  Ah, that's not bad.  Not bad.  About the annual animal.  No, I don't like that.  You got to think of Walmart.  You got to think of Walmart.  Oh, Walmart, right.  Walmart.  Hold on, gangsta fag.  They're actually dragging it because he has a legitimate interview to go to, so.  Well, that sucks.  We were having fun with Nick.  I know.  It was good to see you.  Grandma's boy opens this Friday.  All right.  Bye, buddy.  All right.  Well, come by.  Now the hugs.  Here's my buddy.  All right.  Thank you, Nick.  We really appreciate you stopping by. 
[03:09:00]  Come by when you can just hang out.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I'll see you again.  Thanks for having me.  All right.  It's Nick Schwartzen, everyone.  See you, buddy.  Grandma's boy opens this Friday.  See you, guys.  All right.  See you, man.  Gangsta fag.  You got to make it quick.  All right.  Real quick.  Okay.  If you can come up with a name for my CD, man, hit me up at gangstafag.com and go to  my forum.  Two.  That's the first good news.  The second good news is my CD is off the hook.  They're selling good things to you motherfuckers.  So if you go to my website, I'm going to sell a CD and you get a T-shirt for $9.99 and I'm  going to autograph it.  I never autograph CDs, man. 
[03:09:30]  So I'm going to autograph the next hundred CDs.  You can put them on eBay, do what the fuck you want with them.  The third one is I don't care what you guys say, motherfucking O&A, my booty buddies for  life, baby.  Well, can we put this in another way?  Perhaps like just kind of associates.  He gets the plug.  You know, gangstafag is all about product.  He's all about plugging.  He's all about plugging, whether it's other man's asses or his new CD.  Man ass or CDs, right. 
[03:10:00]  Right.  Or that trying to create false excitement, like I just can't come up with a title.  The contest.  If I could just get 100,000 hits on my website.  Right.  He's a cynic.  He already has the title.  You are so cynical.  I have an idea for the title.  How about ouch?  All right.  Here we go.  Yellow Brick Road.  The retired production of Wizard of Oz.  Yeah.  More Tin Man.  I have the brain of a toad.  I have the brain of a toad. 
[03:10:30]  Here's a...  I should have been left on the sheet as a load.  I should have been left on the sheet as a load.  Oh, my God.  I just remembered.  You have to leave, Bill?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I'm out of here.  They're telling us...  But you know what?  I did my laundry yesterday.  I didn't fold it.  You know, it's going to get all...  It's going to wrinkle.  All right.  Here we go.  Since I've been born, my brain never grows.  I can talk to you.  I can talk to you.  Oh, my goodness.  I can talk to you then.  This feels wonderful. 
[03:11:00]  On my arm, please.  How about I've held that axe up for ages?  I've held that axe up for ages.  My goodness.  My goodness.  My goodness.  Do I stink?  You are confused.  Is that a lie?  That's why you can use me.  My goodness.  Um, my goodness.  How'd you ever end up like that?  Good.  Well, about a year ago, I was chopping that tree, and suddenly, it began to rain. 
[03:11:30]  Raining.  And right in the middle of a chop, I rusted solid.  Go ahead.  Bang on it.  Go ahead.  Bang on it.  Noble heart.  All hollow.  That was his head.  Dong, dong, dong, dong.  Well, they were doing good.  Yeah.  It was rehearsal.  You know, it's been a while.  There's like excitement in their voices. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah.  They finally get to do something.  How did that happen?  Curses!  She's, she's getting away, she's, she's getting closer to Emerald City.  Well, shoes or no shoes, I'm still great enough to counter her.  Conquer.  I'm still great enough to conquer her.  She starts melting because she's spitting on her.  To conquer her.  Say it.  I'm still great enough to conquer?  Conquer.  Conquer.  I'm still great enough to conquer. 
[03:12:30]  That's how they say hit her.  I'm still great enough to conquer her.  Conquer all my head.  I don't like that word.  All right.  Get that retard.  Conquer.  Oh, they just, she doesn't know what the word means.  No.  They're just feeding her blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  They don't, she don't know what it means.  God bless this woman, the patience.  How about tell her?  No kidding.  What about a little instruction there on conquer?  It means to, you know, overtake somebody, to beat them, to win. 
[03:13:00]  You know, give her a definition.  How about, um, think about what you've never done with a life problem.  Oh, Bill Burr.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  More retard, shtick.  I'm trying to be helpful.  It's a rare fucking fool.  Oh, yes, he is.  Here's the mayor talking about his award.  As mayor of Munston City, in the land, in the county of the land of Oz, I welcome you most regally. 
[03:13:30]  That's real regal.  And that's my only line.  Am I good?  Way to break the fourth wall, stupid.  What did you win an award for?  Really worked in Chocolate Factory.  What does that say?  Best Supporting Actor?  Yeah.  In a comedic role.  Uh-huh.  Oof.  Played a chocolate bar. 
[03:14:00]  Lay there and be brown, stupid.  And you know nothing.  Good day, sir.  Oompa, loompa, loompa-dee-doo. 
[03:14:30]  I have one chromosome to few.  Doop-a-dee-doo.  Oof.  Doop-a-dee-dee.  If you are dumb, you'll really like me.  Sorry.  I guess the guy's a veteran of other stage shows on a few place, guys.  He's got a resume.  As we move on here.  I got a golden stain on my underpants. 
[03:15:00]  Sorry.  I can't think of Willy Wonka songs.  Here we meet the great eyes.  A heart is not judged by how much you love, but how much you are loved by others. 
[03:15:30]  Okay.  Good.  Man, that woman is patient.  Unbelievable.  She's doing that with her life.  Absolutely.  You've got to give it up to her.  Jim?  Her codependency sickens me.  And if she had any fucking real chops, she'd be teaching in a college.  Wow.  No one saw the handfuls of Paxil she was taking out of Dorothy's basket.  Nobody sees her fucking crying alone in the bathroom.  That's so fucking stupid. 
[03:16:00]  I can't wait for them anymore.  Her dreams were not what she's doing there.  Her dreams to produce a show.  For Broadway.  For Broadway, probably.  Yeah.  Was not that.  All right.  If I'm going to be cynical, she wants to get on 60 Minutes for them to do a whole expose  on how caring she is.  Oh, is that it?  And this is going to be her big thing.  You know what, Jim?  We have a host of benefits sometimes.  And I'll just say whatever the cause is and talk about how great it is, and then you can  just talk about what's going on behind the curtain.  All right.  I like that.  I like that. 
[03:16:30]  Be a wonderful guest.  It certainly would.  I'd be there.  We got some great, uh, witch lines here.  Oh, some witch lines.  Let's not poke fun at them though.  This is going too far.  Throw the basket in the river and drown him!  No, no.  Wow.  If that's not what her father said.  Yeah, stick to the script.  Let's not bring what you hear at home to the stage.  Might have wanted to leave that line out of the production.  Wow.  That sounded like Paula Poundstone. 
[03:17:00]  Play it again.  Throw the basket in the river and drown him!  No, you can have your own slippers.  Okay, that's okay.  No, no, you can have your own slippers.  Just give me back my dog.  That's a little good girl.  I knew you were seeing reasons.  Wait a minute.  Elizabeth, that's a good little girl.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  That was horrible.  Wait a minute.  Yeah.  Well, she goes, she has to stop and say, wait a minute, like there's a piece of that  that was usable.  Yeah, wait a minute.  Wait.  The whole thing is a scrap.  All these go home.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:17:30]  I want to see the outtakes.  This is the best stuff.  The blue.  Elizabeth.  Yay!  Try it again.  That's a little good girl.  That was horrible.  That was a little real.  You are so fucking mean, man.  Look, Matt, you're going to do this for 40 minutes.  I mean, I'm still trying to hype that I met Caroline this weekend.  Don't just blurt out sounds.  That was Joker hitting pile like he didn't want to do it, and then when he did, he fucking  really unloaded on him. 
[03:18:00]  Bill Burr, Caroline's all weekend long starting Thursday night.  Did I ever tell you that story when I first started out in comedy and was working at Framingham,  Massachusetts?  They had some nicks out there, right?  And there was literally this crowd of, like, 30 people, and some lady showed up with this  kid who was, like, severely, severely retarded, right?  Just like, eh, eh, making noises like that.  So they put this kid up on stage.  It was literally his third time on fucking stage.  So he's up there, and this kid is making so much noise.  Even if people were going to laugh at his jokes, there would have been nothing. 
[03:18:30]  So he's just up there, bombing, in dead silence, except he'd, like, tell a joke, and there'd  be nothing.  And then the kid was like, eh, eh, eh.  And literally by, like, his third joke, which was one of the greatest ad-libs I heard, he  went, like, he told the joke, it got nothing.  The kid goes, eh, eh, eh.  The dude on stage goes, dude, I hear ya.  Let's get into the witch, because we're running out of show here.  I'm sorry.  It's okay.  Oh, B.  That's a good story.  Bill Burr, Caroline's all weekend long.  2-1-2-7-5-7-4-100. 
[03:19:00]  I don't like it, we're running out of show.  I wasn't noticing that.  Hey, and I'm also the independent party on MySpace.  Oh.  As far as you two guys.  Yes, I know.  Yes.  Yeah, for some reason, I can't be his friend anymore.  I'm the Jerry Brown of MySpace.  Thanks.  Here we go.  Elizabeth, that's a good little girl.  Yeah.  Oh.  Try it again.  That's a little good girl.  No, Elizabeth.  Brother.  You know why she can't say it?  Because she's never heard it.  Nothing to base it on. 
[03:19:30]  She keeps saying, that's a horrible disappointment.  No.  No, no.  Good little girl.  It's your fault.  You did drugs in college.  That's a good little girl.  We can leave her somewhere.  She'll never find us.  No.  That's a good little girl.  She'll never amount to anything.  Put her in an institution.  What if we stop feeding her?  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Put that down, dummy. 
[03:20:00]  No, that's not it.  That's a good little girl.  Let's move on here.  We can participate.  Yes.  Try it again.  You keep saying, that's a little good girl.  It's, that's a good little girl.  That's a good little girl.  I knew you were seeing reason.  Ah!  I just noticed, those slippers will never come off, as long as you're alive.  All right. 
[03:20:30]  Let's go to, that's a good little girl.  Can we just do that from page 17?  Top of 17.  Go.  That's a little good girl.  That's a good little girl.  It's not a little good girl.  Wow.  Try it again.  That's a good, that's a good girl.  I knew you were seeing reason.  The other kids are laughing at her.  What?  Little girl, I forgot.  Sorry.  I should have remembered.  Ah!  I should have remembered. 
[03:21:00]  Those shoes will never come off until you're alive.  Until you're alive?  I want to smack them all.  Those shoes will never come off until you're alive?  Until you're alive.  That's a little good girl.  I want to go give to some sort of foundation.  Yeah.  So do I, the fucking pro-choice.  I want to go give to family planning.  Generously.  Generously.  All right.  Well, the witch tries it a third time. 
[03:21:30]  Take three.  Run, Toto, run.  He got away.  It was more than you, Will, my pretty.  You're not much more to live.  Something like that.  Yeah, something like that.  Something like that.  Who's that, Colin, now?  No, you know?  Yeah.  I wish we could do that with this radio show.  Something like that.  Whatever.  Something like that.  She used the fucking tippy-tom-out line to get out of that one.  What was that song you were singing?  Come on, baby, light my fire. 
[03:22:00]  Something like that.  Nothing like that is right.  Nothing like that.  How about, how about, how about which is more than you, Will?  You have much longer to be alive, my pretty.  I can't wait forever to get those shoes.  I couldn't do this.  Read it if you don't know it.  It's okay.  Just cry.  Do you know who we are?  Just cry.  Which is more than you, Will.  You have a much longer...  She's on overload. 
[03:22:30]  Which is more than you, Will.  You have a much longer B.L.I., my pretty.  I can't wait ever to get those shoes.  Oh, too much information.  Wow.  Yeah.  Flop sweat.  Thank God it's a show that, like, everyone knows.  There's no one that doesn't know the story to it, so you can sit there and kind of...  Fill in the blanks.  Yeah, fill in those many blanks.  Dreck, dreck, dreck.  Ah, red shoes.  I see where we are.  Right.  Fill in the blank stares. 
[03:23:00]  Dribble, dribble, drool, dribble.  Yeah, mist-lying, flub, unintelligible, flying monkeys, okay?  Yeah, we are.  We're an hour in, flying monkeys.  Witch melting, okay.  We got it.  Oh, wait, that's just the Tin Man's family.  Oh, my God.  Bill coming?  I'm going to be at Caroline.  Yes.  We're fifth through the eighth.  I'm going to punchline in San Francisco next week, if you're out there.  Down's kid has some trouble. 
[03:23:30]  Aw, Jesus.  Apologize for it.  He's on the way!  He's on the way!  No!  Bridget, you're going to say, the dog is gone!  The dog is gone!  Yeah, man, that's good.  Right again.  You ready?  Let's go and run!  Go, he's gone!  No, no, no, Bridget.  Joe goes first.  I just say it first, and then you say it first.  Do it, Bridget.  Ready?  One, two, three.  Bridget.  Ready?  Go!  He's run away!  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Listen to me. 
[03:24:00]  Come on.  Ready?  Ready?  He's run away!  The dog is gone!  You got it?  Yes.  Bridget, you wanted to be a monkey, right?  Yes.  So, come on.  Ready?  One, two, three, go!  He's run away!  Don't run away!  Don't run away!  Dog run away!  Dog, dog run away!  Those real thoughts keep creeping.  The dog ran away.  I pet him and he died when I pet him too hard!  No.  No, that's not what you're supposed to say.  The dog ran away.  I ate his foot because it's soft!  I don't want to burn, baby! 
[03:24:30]  No, stupid.  Dog ran away!  Put him in the oven!  Dog ran away!  I saw him with my big retard ass!  Bridget.  What a sexy name.  Fucking Bridget is weighing this whole production down.  She's an anchor on the neck of this production.  She's an anchor on the neck of this production.  Let's go. 
[03:25:00]  Kirby.  Kirby from Oklahoma.  Kirby.  Dog ran away!  Into hiding you.  High-paying jobs and education.  None of that for you.  The retard can.  The retarded man can.  He's doing a little Willy Wonka tie-in.  A little late.  Oh, that was good.  A little, uh, yeah.  The dog is gone!  It's gone!  It's gone!  It's gone!  I can't see it!  Wow.  You want to say it first? 
[03:25:30]  Bridget's going to get replaced.  I think so.  Yeah.  And the other retards are laughing at you.  The dog is gone!  He's run away!  Happy New Year!  Happy New Year!  That's all it takes.  63 takes.  There's such small expectations.  Do you know Renee Zellweger is actually doing a movie about her?  It's called Bridget the Retard's Diary.  Where you just open it up and it's all pages that are stuck together with crayon scribble.  F-E-E-D.  The fucking glue and the binding is all gone because she's picked it and put it in her eye. 
[03:26:00]  We have never had perfection, obviously.  It's something we talk about, we dream about.  Strive for that.  This is the 60 minutes moment.  We'll never retain that.  And that's okay because I really think that the great stuff comes, you know, in the possibilities,  not in the guarantees.  Yeah.  She's such an angel.  There's such a wide gap.  Now it's become all self-serving.  Yeah, it's her.  There's, you know, there's perfection and eating paste. 
[03:26:30]  And you've got to find a middle ground, lady.  Don't strive for the perfection.  Yes.  Give the kids a break.  Striving for the possibilities, which is that we'll make it through this production without  someone starting a fire.  Someone skipping down the hill of the road and tripping on some poopy.  They all have yellow brick underpants, don't you, you adult babies? 
[03:27:00]  You know what would be the ultimate for you guys to actually get one of the performers  from this play to come in here and hype it?  I'll plug the show.  Yes.  It's not a bad idea.  We've had a free thought.  It's great.  The great and powerful Oz is going to grant your request.  Every word.  Say it one more time.  Is the silence whippersnapper.  I am the greater powerful Oz who is going to grant your request. 
[03:27:30]  I owe Oz money and I'm dodging him.  Pay no attention to that walnut behind the skull.  I don't know if we did this for the last week, but pay no attention to that man behind  the curtain in the family picture. 
[03:28:00]  Bill's tapping out.  Bill's tapping out.  Pay no attention to that embarrassment under the Pete Rose.  Thank you.  Oh, shit.  We're running out of time.  We have ten to go.  Pay no attention to that man that everyone else is throwing berries at.  Pay no attention to me.  I'm used to it.  Eight more minutes. 
[03:28:30]  Here's the witch.  Here's the witch.  Talking about how she never gets the best rolls.  I try and do my best, but the trick always gets the main roll.  Pay no attention to that sonogram.  Mother didn't.  Mother didn't.  Oh, shit. 
[03:29:00]  Hey, wait.  He was just on our show.  Nick.  Oh.  Hey.  Basketball team.  Your college basketball team.  Duke is my diehard pastor.  In the studio downstairs.  Dude, basketball is everything.  Wasn't he just on our show?  Yeah.  I have to believe he had no shot.  That's the moment.  All right.  Oh.  Hey.  The witch.  Talking about how she doesn't get the good rolls.  That's usually not the only one, doll, if I'm on.  You know what?  There's egos in this, too.  Tell them what Dorothy says.  Ding, dong.  I shit my bed. 
[03:29:30]  I don't know.  I don't see the women in Kansas anymore.  There's no place like home.  Nothing at all.  Inside my head.  I think she's like a role model to me because who I am as an actress.  Just tap your heels three times and say, there's no one that loves me at home.  There's no one that loves me at home.  Look at Bill. 
[03:30:00]  There's no place like the home.  There's no place like the home.  Oh, shit.  All right.  The mayor has something very important to say here.  Of course he does.  I'm not allowed to cross the street, but if I'm with you guys, I'm allowed to walk in the street.  I'm like the mayor around here now since you guys came.  That's actually the music that they hear in their heads.  Yeah, they got to play that music every time. 
[03:30:30]  The great Oz gives Tin Man a heart.  As for you, my good friend, you want a heart.  You don't know how lucky not to have one.  You are not to have one.  You are not to have one.  Oh.  Wait, David.  Wait.  And remember, my sentimental friend, a heart will be un...  A heart is not judged how much you love, but how much you are loved by others. 
[03:31:00]  That's the one line you have to get.  Why don't they just have them do a period piece?  I mean, you could have picked something a little bit.  Fucking doing Latin.  How about a Charlie Brown Christmas?  Fucking lighten it up a little bit.  A little bit.  He's having a real tough time with that.  Who goeth there?  Yeah.  Relieve the pressure a little bit.  Wait.  Do we have any audio of this fucking guy talking about how he's in my brain? 
[03:31:30]  Chromosome, chromosome.  Wherefore, aren't our chromosome?  Girl, I don't know.  I don't know why.  Can't get enough of your love brain.  Oh, something that can't get used to.  No matter how I try.  It's like the more you give, the more I want.  And baby, that's no lie.  Oh, no, baby. 
[03:32:00]  I don't remember this.  The Wizard of Oz.  What can I say?  Tom Jones with Down Syndrome?  No, that was a black retarded kid picking up the three white retarded chicks.  You don't know.
