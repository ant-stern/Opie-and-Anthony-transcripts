<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with a discussion about the apparent death (later corrected to a stroke) of Clarence Clemons, prompting a debate among the hosts, Sam Roberts, Eric, and Roland (a self-proclaimed Bruce Springsteen superfan) about its impact on Springsteen's future performances.  The hosts bantered over who was the biggest Springsteen fan in the studio, mentioning Spencer and Ross.  This led to Bobo performing a comedic, inaccurate rendition of "Born to Run" as a tribute to Clemons.  Jim Norton's unexpected singing of "Everybody's Working for the Weekend" was also a key highlight discussed in the post-show segment.

The show then shifted to a discussion of Troy's post-show distress.  Speculation arose regarding the reasons for his unease, including Kenny's apparent, possibly unrequited, romantic interest in Troy.  Roland's failed attempt at a scream was also mentioned.  Troy himself later clarified his discomfort stemmed from the unpredictable and extreme highs and lows inherent in appearing on the show.

A substantial portion of the broadcast recounted a previous show featuring Sharon Osbourne and Bret Michaels, focusing on the media fallout from a video clip of Osbourne insulting Susan Boyle.  This was compared to the recent publicity surrounding the show's release of Representative Wiener's "cockpicture."  Jim Norton's infamous fall at an awards show was also recounted. The conversation drifted through other tangents, including a new Bobo production and upcoming Troy appearances.  The upcoming appearance of Jada Pinkett Smith was mentioned, along with some confusion over her acting credits.  The difficulties in booking Loverboy as a guest were also discussed, concluding with a final mention of Liam's panicked reaction to one of Anthony's prank calls.  The after-show segment featured Sam Roberts, Eric, and Roland discussing these events.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The virus. Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yes, it is. After Opie and Anthony Live.  Of course, I'm Sam Roberts.  Looks like Opie and Anthony did manage to get out of here.  They were stopped by both management and talent bookers,  more specifically, Roland,  directly in the hallway, right outside the door, 
[00:00:30]  but it looks like they managed to escape.  It's a task that's not done easily,  and it's something that Travis is waving at me and pointing to me.  I think one of the bosses is outside.  I wonder if they're talking about me right now.  I don't know, but they are smiling, so hopefully they are.  Eric, do you think they're talking about me?  Not at all.  What do you think they're talking about?  Who the hell knows at this point?  Not strong with improv.  I'm looking up the rest of the bits here.  Oh, okay, okay, okay.  Well, then I'll give you a break.  Eric, I don't know how we hear it after Opie and Anthony Live can follow a show as epic as we had on Friday with Loverboy. 
[00:01:00]  You just heard highlights of it on the Opie and Anthony show.  And, I mean, later on, I think later on in this after show, Eric, if you could make it happen,  I would love to hear Jim singing.  Later on.  Not right now.  You don't have to cut it right now.  Oh, what he just did?  Yeah, maybe when one of the bits are playing.  Sure.  We could replay it for some of the people who didn't hear it or probably want to hear it again because it was absolutely hilarious.  But a lot of stuff going on. 
[00:01:30]  And now Roland and Travis and the big boss, as far as we're concerned.  I mean, their boss is above him, but not that we deal with, are walking together in a unit.  I also want to talk to Troy at some point on the after show today because Opie had a good observation during the break that,  for whatever reason, every time Troy's on the air, he leaves feeling bummed out.  Now, I mean, I thought he had, given what show this is, I think Troy's music was pretty well received. 
[00:02:00]  Eric, he shares the room with you.  Do you have any insight on why Troy was a little shaken after today?  Well, Troy comes back every time.  I mean, at least that I've seen with the conspiracy stuff.  Yeah.  Comes back and he goes, what do they want me to say?  You know, I'm not trying to convince them or anything.  I'm not trying to get them on my side.  Well, we both know.  He just comes back defensive all the time.  With conspiracies, he just has questions.  He does.  He has questions.  He's very curious.  Spencer's leading somebody around here in a fancy, who's that?  Right outside your window.  Can you tell? 
[00:02:30]  I don't recognize who that is.  I'm trying to figure out if there are any really famous people coming in here today.  Maybe we can slide them on the show.  There's one for, I know they're doing hits one.  Who?  Jada Pinkett Smith is going to be up here.  Oh.  You think she'll bring her husband with her?  I doubt it.  He never goes and does anything.  How do you know?  Because he's an A-list celebrity.  But you don't know that.  You're just saying that to sound like you're in the business and you know something.  Damn you, Sam.  It's true, though, isn't it?  Okay.  Listen.  We are, we're not going to dilly-dally because I'm not going to rest on my laurels. 
[00:03:00]  There's a lot of stuff to do.  So, for instance, today we talked about it a little on the show, Roland came in because  Clarence Clemens of the E Street Band passed away.  Maybe we should talk to Roland about that, too.  I know everybody loves to hear from Roland.  And I know he talked about it a little on the ONA show, but what exactly Clarence Clemens  meant to him.  Um, people think that Roland is the only E Street Band fanatic on the Opie and Anthony 
[00:03:30]  show.  But that's not the case.  I'm stalling a little bit because Roland is slowly walking up the hallway.  When you're a guy Roland's size, you don't move fast.  He's having some trouble today.  It's very humid out.  It's not humid.  I mean, it's cooler today than it has been in weeks.  But he comes back, he's been sweating a lot.  Roland, are you hot today?  Dude.  It's not hot today.  I'm sweating balls.  Why?  Well, because, uh, um, well, I have extra cushion. 
[00:04:00]  Okay.  It's the way to wait.  I'm not even a lot.  I have extra cushion, people.  Good for you, Roland.  Yeah, I like the new Roland.  You're just exhausted of this on-air stuff because you keep, somehow you end up in trouble  every time.  I do, I do.  You don't have anything bad to say about anybody anymore, correct?  I love, I love, I love everybody.  You love everybody.  So the days.  Me and Jesus, we love everybody.  The days of Roland going off the handle and saying outlandish things, toodaloo.  Eh, maybe.  Or at least they're taking a break.  Yes.  Um, how are you doing?  Clarence Clemens. 
[00:04:30]  I know you, you, you have an affinity for Bruce Springsteen.  Yeah, but it's going to be sad though, because he is like the Eastry band.  That's what made the Eastry band.  Do you care about him the way you would care about somebody who you look up to, or is  it just more like, oh, I'm sad about this because it's going to make things tougher for  Bruce?  Eh, both.  But it's more of a Bruce thing.  Yeah, and the thing is though, like when Bruce comes out for the first song, and then the  second song is like The Promised Land, when he plays a harmonica, you know Clarence Park's 
[00:05:00]  coming up.  Yeah.  And then Clarence will stand out on the side of the stage, pull up his saxophone.  The whole arena always goes nuts.  See, you say you know this is going to happen, you know, I don't know any of that's going  to happen, because I haven't been to 200 Eastry band shows.  But every Bruce fan, you'll hear him go, oh, here he comes.  And then you wave, and then you're, ah!  But if you already know it's coming, why don't you just get the DVD or something?  It's like St. Brub Zombie.  Just see the movies.  You don't need to meet him or see these songs.  You need to be there.  You've got to be there live to experience it. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, yeah.  But I mean, like, how many shows have you been to?  How many Bruce shows have you been to?  Like 240-something.  Are you the biggest Bruce fan in this building?  No, I, well, Spencer is a big Bruce fan, and also Ross.  Oh, so you might not even be the biggest Bruce fan in the talent department.  No, because since they are older than me, so they were able to see, like, the  classic tours, like the river.  So would you say, is Bruce, is, is...  Spencer's probably seen, like, more classic shows, because he's lived in Jersey.  Do you think he's a bigger Bruce fan than you, Spencer?  I would say so, because he... 
[00:06:00]  Wow.  Because he grew up in the, like, he was in Jersey during the era of the classic  Secret Bruce shows and everything that he saw.  But I see Spencer.  So I respect Spencer for that.  And I see Ross walking around.  Yeah.  They don't wear Bruce Springsteen t-shirts every single day of their lives.  Sometimes.  But not every day.  Well, Ross does, because he's, like, upper management.  He's supposed to wear a tie and everything.  Do you think if he could get away with it, he would wear a Bruce shirt every day?  He would wear a Bruce shirt every day, I think.  So Ross is the ultimate Bruce fan.  I think, well, I think Spencer kind of edges him out. 
[00:06:30]  I think it was Spencer, Ross, and me.  Did he not die?  Eric, talk into the mic.  I just got a call.  Did you say he died?  Yeah.  He didn't die.  He had a stroke.  I didn't say that.  Well, no, I said he died.  Oh.  You got to correct that.  Well, all right.  He didn't die, then.  Sorry.  What difference does it make?  You can get in trouble for that.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  What?  I just got it wrong.  Pretend somebody died?  Well, I didn't mean it.  It's not like a prank.  I'm not saying, hey, go and tell...  I just got it wrong.  I don't know anything about Clarence Clemens.  He had a stroke. 
[00:07:00]  How come you didn't...  Oh, you weren't in here.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You weren't in here.  Is he going to die?  No.  No?  No?  But is he going to make a recovery and play again?  He may do, like, the last tour.  I thought he died.  Where he'll play a few shows.  Like, the local shows, the East Coast, I'll play.  They kind of may arrest him for the West Coast.  So, we're going to Roland, the master of Bruce Springsteen trivia.  Is Clarence Clemens dead?  No.  Good to know.  You see?  The information that I did not have before this conversation. 
[00:07:30]  He's alive.  You know, we were talking about Bruce fans in this company.  Spencer, Ross.  Are there any other major Bruce fans here?  Or is it isolated?  David Marsh.  Well, other than the E Street Radio guys, of course.  David Marsh.  No, that's about me.  Well, you're missing one key Bruce Springsteen fan.  And the guy who I feel like...  Gaga?  No, Gaga doesn't work here.  Well, someone who's associated with, actually, the virus. 
[00:08:00]  The guy who I think does a better Bruce Springsteen impression.  Do you do a Bruce impression?  He's him.  That's very good.  But there's a guy who I think does one even better than you, Roland.  Who?  Bobo.  Oh, no.  Bobo is a giant Springsteen fan.  And this is actually, before we had the up and down game, before we had the ban Bobo from  the show game and make him cry, before all this abuse was laid out on him, when he was  just a weirdo, it was Bobo Springsteen. 
[00:08:30]  Now, this is pretty much...  Eric, am I wrong?  That's pretty...  I mean, I've been wrong before on this show.  Today, for example.  That was his first major bit on the show, wasn't it?  Bobo Springsteen?  I don't think that was his first major bit.  Well, what was then?  I mean, his first major recurring bit?  Oh, just himself.  I mean, other than, you know, here's Bobo.  He's stupid.  Watch him say dumb stuff.  Like, his first major recurring bit, I believe, was Bobo Springsteen.  All right.  We'll go with that.  Okay. 
[00:09:00]  Thank you.  Bobo Springsteen, for those of you who don't know, is Bobo doing Anthony's Bruce Springsteen  impression.  And here it is.  On After Opie and Anthony Live, in honor of Clarence Clemens, not in memory of, in honor  of the guy who's still alive.  You think this is going to really hurt?  Hopefully he's...  You know what, Clarence, I know you listen to After Opie and Anthony Live usually.  Make the switch over to E Street Radio for a couple minutes, as we honor you with the  man, the myth, the legend, Bobo Springsteen, right here on, well, After Opie and Anthony 
[00:09:30]  Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  You want to do a little Bobo Springsteen, a little Born to Run?  He's been working on the song.  He's been standing there like an idiot.  Should get this out of the way?  Him and David.  Yeah.  All right.  Look, he's studying the words.  You know this song?  You know where the words go?  Yeah.  Yeah, I think I have an idea where some of the words go, right?  Could someone point out...  With some of the words go.  I have an idea where some of the words go.  Hmm.  Interesting. 
[00:10:00]  That doesn't mean...  That means no.  I don't know where the words go.  I love that you guys printed out on three-point Helvetica, too, just to make it harder.  Yeah.  Look at you, you font expert.  I am.  Three-point Helvetica.  All right.  Yeah, he's studying the words.  Enough studying.  Singing time.  It's time.  All right.  All right.  Let's go.  All right.  Let's go with it.  Let's do this.  And, you know, give it some passion, some excitement.  All right?  Okay.  Don't be shy.  Well, he's not shy.  No.  No.  Oh, no. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, no.  Not yet.  Ready?  Go.  In the day we sweat it out on the streets of the runway American dream.  At the night we ride the man to the glorious sewer side machine.  Sewer side.  Sewer.  Sprung from cages out on Highway 9. 
[00:11:00]  Oh.  He went.  He went.  Now he's behind.  Just go.  Crawl wheeled in jacket stepping over the lawn.  Baby, this town rips from your back.  It's like a bitch having a suicide.  We've got to get out of the way we have to dress like that.  Baby, we want to run.  Wow.  He caught up, I think.  Wendy, let me in.  No.  Not yet. 
[00:11:30]  Ready?  And go.  Wendy, let me in.  I want to be your friend.  I want to guard your dreams and visions.  Just rip your legs around these velvet rims.  And destroy your hands across my engine.  Oh, geez.  Together we can break this trip.  We're going to run until we drop.  Baby, we'll never go back.  We will walk with me out of the water. 
[00:12:00]  Because, baby, I'm just scared of the lonely rider.  But I'm going to find out what it feels like.  I want to know if love is wild and true.  I want to know if...  If you know love is real.  Beyond the dream.  No.  No, not yet.  Yeah, you've got to dance a little bit.  I think there's a solo or something.  Oh, yeah.  Fucking horn.  Go Clarence.  Exactly.  Beyond the dream. 
[00:12:30]  No.  Baby, I was born to dirt nap.  Not yet.  Ready?  Ready.  Go.  Go now.  Beyond the palace.  Hemi-Powardone's extremes of the boulevard.  A girl comes in here in the rearview mirror.  And the boy's trying to look so hard.  She moves the bar.  Oh, he's going to have it himself.  Oh, he's kind of caught up. 
[00:13:00]  No.  Big ending.  Coming up.  Coming up. 
[00:13:30]  Ready?  Ready.  And one, two, three, go.  The highway for jammed with the broken heroes on the left.  No, no.  The highway for jammed with the broken heroes on the left.  The power drive.  Everybody has to run tonight, but there's no place left to hide.  Together, Wendy, we live in all the madness.  Along here with all the madness in my soul.  Someday, girl.  I want to know when we're going to go to that place.  What do we really want to go to?  And, well, we'll get no sun. 
[00:14:00]  But don't let the grandparents like us.  Baby, we were born to run.  What the hell is this?  That's what he actually thinks as he's singing. 
[00:14:30]  It's the Terry Schiavo cover.  Yeah.  Oh, macadamia brain.  David's dancing.  Ends with the catchphrase thing. 
[00:15:00]  Wow.  That was.  They're in shock back there.  Oh, thank God.  Feedback.  Yeah.  I mean, my ears needed the refreshing sound of feedback after that.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  Oh.  Hey, your girl's your daddy home. 
[00:15:30]  Don't, don't go away.  If you're all alone.  There's a bad desire.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, I'm on fire.  Tell me, how this baby hits fit to you.  I'm a junior step.  If I like him.  Put your feet higher.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire 
[00:16:00]  Sometimes it's like summer and life  Since I'm in the other room, too  Tonight I wake up and I'm in the right  Turned on a shower  Me and Kiffa was dying  Oh, oh, I'm on fire 
[00:16:30]  Oh, oh, I'm on fire  Oh, oh, I'm on fire  Thank you. 
[00:17:00]  After O&A, it's live. 
[00:17:30]  But Clarence Clemens isn't dead. He had a stroke.  And so Roland is more grieving the fact that he may not be able to play again than the fact that he's actually dead.  Somebody's feedbacking in.  Is Springsteen a New York thing?  Springsteen is a jersey.  Jersey.  Jersey.  Like Sinatra. 
[00:18:00]  The Giants.  I thought that was very clear.  Statue of Liberty.  Where's Troy? Is he around? Is he listening somewhere?  Do you want to talk about Troy? He mentioned the 675 bar for tomorrow.  That's true. He is DJing tomorrow.  That was hilarious because he was so focused.  And then went like this.  Kenny was texting me the whole time.  Kenny has a real, like a serious hard-on for Troy.  We were just saying, Kenny, Club Soda, he's got a serious hard-on for you, Troy.  Yeah, Troy, his singing scared me.  Troy Soda, Kenny on Facebook?  Yeah, that guy. 
[00:18:30]  He was texting me the whole time you were in, because I was sitting next to you in studio,  asking me to plug different things that you do.  Yeah.  And I did, but it's weird that he's got this affinity for you.  His scream scared me.  Kenny's the fucking man, I mean.  But it gets weird at times.  No, I don't think, I've never felt weird around Kenny.  Kenny's an awesome dude.  I think there may be a sexual element, is what I'm saying.  On his end?  On his end, not yours.  Well, I can't speak for him, but.  Right.  Not on my end, I'm fine.  Would that bother you, or just kind of flatter you, and you'd go about your life? 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, I mean, as long as he keeps it professional.  Yeah, you don't mind.  We're okay.  There was a question.  Roland, you were saying his screaming scared you.  Yeah.  Wow, Roland's good at it, too.  Good, really try to give a scream.  Good.  Eric, could you mark that or something?  I want Opie and Anthony to hear this.  Mark it from here.  Okay.  Roland is going to do, he's going to throw it, don't laugh, because we want this clean.  Roland, go for it. 
[00:19:30]  I said, oh my god, it sounds like a woman.  Is that real?  Is that it?  I really can't like.  Okay, do it like from your real, like from the bass.  It's funny that he can't even get at that.  Isn't there any kind of bass?  Like, they don't have a high pitch.  It's like Cloverfield. 
[00:20:00]  Okay, so it isn't working.  No, my voice is too high.  I hope he brought something up.  He did it during commercial break, but I don't think it was, you know, terribly private.  If it was, whoops.  But you kind of have an uneasy look when you leave the studio.  Like, every time.  When I leave the studio or when I come in?  When you leave.  Like, after the appearance, you look like you're either bummed out or unsure.  Sounds like Charlie's dates.  Heyo.  Go on, Roller.  I can't, I can't. 
[00:20:30]  Like, you don't like the way something went?  Well, it's one of those things where, you know, working for this show is such a rollercoaster  that the highs are so high.  You know what I mean?  Like, to get in here and to be able to talk about awesome music with the guys and play,  you know, my band.  Well, awesome is a subjective term.  Well, whatever, but go ahead.  In my opinion.  And then the lows are so low.  So, I try to just mentally balance myself out.  Be like, oh, that was a cool segment.  Tomorrow, something awful is going to happen. 
[00:21:00]  I forgot to mention your 675 bar.  Right.  Well, we'll get to it.  Tomorrow.  So, you're saying you walk in with your defenses on.  Well, of course.  Like, you're ready.  Like, you play them the stuff that you do.  You're art, for lack of a better term.  And you're ready for them to completely smash it.  So, when they say that's actually not bad.  I'm a little confused.  You're not really prepared to embrace that.  I mean, you know, I mean, everybody knows the nature of the show.  And it's just the nature of the show.  You have to walk in, you know, with your guard up, your fists up in the air like, 
[00:21:30]  who's going to come at me to fucking try to slit my throat?  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  So, when it doesn't happen, you're just kind of like, oh, okay.  And so, like, maybe the vibe that we're getting after the show,  after your appearance on the show, is sort of just like,  I have to decompress.  I have to figure out what just happened.  Yeah.  You're not, like, used to the sort of, like, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, we're done.  What, what's the underhanded comments that were made?  Yeah.  So, is that what you do?  You go back cycling through who said what and say, what do they really mean by that? 
[00:22:00]  I just, I have a hard time when it goes smooth.  Like, I'm just so used to getting lambasted for something that when I walk out of your,  everything went smooth for 30 minutes or whatever, it's just a little confusing.  I have to tell you, the I want to kill you stuff, you know that that's not necessarily  what one would call my scene, but I would be into that when I was in high school,  and I can see the merit in it.  Yeah.  Like, I know.  I would not.  You would not.  Well, you've listened to Bruce for a long time.  Like, Mr. Mr. Wing Chun. 
[00:22:30]  You like that?  That's more your sort of vibe.  I was like, yeah, everybody went to check in there, like, ooh.  But, like, when I was in high school, I was listening to, like, I thought the coolest kids  in school were the kids with the band, where the lead singer was older than the other kids  in the band.  Like, he shouldn't be hanging out with these high school kids anymore.  But it was, like, thrash death metal.  Yeah.  So, like, I know that, like, I would have been way into that in high school.  Well, the guys that I play with are unbelievably talented musicians, and we love heavy extreme  music. 
[00:23:00]  But to just copy the easy stuff, and we try to make it as difficult as we possibly can just  for the fun of doing that.  Mm-hmm.  Well, it's, and we should mention, as Roland mentioned at the complete wrong times, throughout  this conversation, you're playing tomorrow, you're DJing, which you're DJing tomorrow,  not death metal, but...  Right.  I DJ, it's like, I do a lot of, like, everything from hip-hop to house music.  It's fun.  It's like, and I do mash-ups on the spot.  It's at 675 Bar in Manhattan in the West Village, and then Friday in Redding, Pennsylvania 
[00:23:30]  at Club Reverb with DJ Q-Ball from the Bloodhound Gang.  Oh, shit.  Well, I'll tell you this.  I believe that you are sculpting a personality for yourself that is unlike any of the other  people on the Opie and Anthony show, and I think we'll do good things for you.  Oh.  Because the community that embraces what you embrace will embrace you, because there  hasn't, you know what I mean?  Like, just because the guys in here, me, Opie, Anthony, Jim, looked at you like, who the  fuck is this guy?  That's because we don't embrace anything in that community anyway. 
[00:24:00]  Right.  Like, there are people who embrace that that are listening.  They're going to be like, that's my guy, Troy.  Well, I'm just waiting for it to take a horrible turn for the worse.  It will.  Undeniably, it will.  I mean, just horribly.  You'll end up in here, possibly nude, humiliating yourself, wondering, how did I get to this point?  Yeah.  This took a really bad turn.  Like, they're going to say, oh, remember, you pissed in your mouth.  Let's see it.  You'll be like, okay.  And as you're pissing, as the piss hits the roof of your mouth, you'll be like, how did 
[00:24:30]  they, how did this happen?  Yeah, I mean, I would do that now, but they won't let you drink piss here at SiriusX.  What if you go and piss in a bathroom into a bottle, come back out of the bottle drinking?  I would need a, uh, an okay from everybody down the hall that, yes, that's okay for you to  do.  Well, I mean, they're not going to give that to this show.  Maybe ONA.  Who knows?  Yeah, I'm not going to get that.  I do have a found new respect for Troy, because I can't scream that bad.  Well, you scream pretty well, but it was a very musical show today.  Yeah.  Um, and you weren't the only one who was singing. 
[00:25:00]  As a matter of fact, at the end of the show, if you missed it, Jim Norton, let it, did you  know that you, I mean, he could have been an eighties icon.  Yeah.  Did you know he had that in him?  I did not know, but it was, it was amazing.  Do you want to hear, Eric, what did, what did we get from that?  Did, did you just pull the, uh, the long, the verse he sang?  Uh, yeah, it's Jimmy doing the entire thing.  Okay, so here is, you know, last week, last Friday, we had Loverboy in here in probably  the most epic moment in after Opie and Anthony history, singing Everybody's Working for 
[00:25:30]  the Weekend.  Today, on the Opie and Anthony show, eighties icon Jim Norton performed the same song.  But didn't they ask for sex, but you're like, who's sex bagel?  Yeah, actually, I'll, I'll tell you, let's play this song, and that's a good point, Roland.  This is Jim Norton, uh, playing Everybody's Working for the Weekend.  You will look.  Everyone's watching to see what you will do.  Everyone's looking at you. 
[00:26:00]  Oh!  Everyone's wondering, will you come out tonight?  Everyone's trying to get it right.  Yeah, yeah, Jimmy, that was good.  You didn't do the Working for the Weekend part.  Everyone's working for the weekend.  That's not how he calls it. 
[00:26:30]  Everyone's working on the weekend.  No, you don't work on the weekend.  Sure, it is.  Some people have to, yes.  The chorus is a little different.  This is the song for the common man.  He won a piece of my heart.  Fucking good, man.  I play games.  That's good shit right there.  Yeah, that will start hurting my throat soon.  Oh, yeah, you're not going to be able to talk.  It was, I mean, it was well done.  The hook was a little off at points. 
[00:27:00]  But, you know, looking at the whole package, it was well done.  And I did want to add, too, we played some clips of the Loverboy after ONA appearance on Opie and Anthony today.  I didn't get to say on the air, but Anthony got his prank call through.  And afterwards, you know, I was telling the guys, thanks for coming.  Bye, bye, bye.  And, you know, just making sure everybody was okay.  And the lead singer for Loverboy, whatever his name is, goes, so, Pete, who is that, your brother or something?  I don't know who it was. 
[00:27:30]  Probably a regular caller, though.  I don't know.  Let's avoid this topic altogether.  And then Roland reminded me, too, just before the song played, that Sex Man, what did he add?  Because I said, when you put the song on, I said, hit it, Sex Bagel.  And then what did he talk to you about?  We play the song, we kill the mics, and the song's playing it out to commercial.  He throws off his headphones, says, this is good.  And then he goes, who's Sex Bagel?  So I was like, oh, that's me.  You embraced it. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  But then he asked me if he could have that name, because I guess he does a radio show in Canada.  He's like a morning job in Canada.  Yeah, a morning show in Canada.  He's like, can I use that name?  I was like, all yours.  He has a British accent?  Well, whatever.  Yeah, British Canadian.  That's funny.  So he wants to use the name Sex Bagel on his show.  Sex Bagel A?  You know, you have to realize that you, Eric Nagel, need to take possession of the name Sex Bagel, really embrace it, and franchise this shit.  Every morning show should have a Sex Bagel. 
[00:28:30]  Agreed.  Yeah.  Oh, like that's the new Stump Boy name kind of thing?  Yeah, like, I mean, turd had his run.  Sex Bagel is so the new turd.  All right.  Don't you think so?  And we could franchise this?  You could be getting paid instead of just giving it out to 80s icons.  Yeah, I'm going to have to do that.  I'll call Bob.  Well, it was a big week of radio last week.  If you call Bob, he'll just keep the money.  I thought we weren't trashing people anymore.  Oh, that's right.  Shit.  God damn it.  It's all right.  It's going to take time, Roland.  It's going to take time to get there. 
[00:29:00]  That's right.  It was a big week in radio.  Beyond the Loverboy thing, we also made some news here at the O.B. and Anthony Show.  O.B. and Anthony were the ones who released the Representative Wiener cockpicture to the world.  They put it on their Twitter, and the O.B. and Anthony Show ended up on every news telecast, in every newspaper.  I mean, even throughout the weekend, Bill Maher was talking about us.  I think we were on CNN still throughout the weekend.  Everybody was talking about us.  And people were running around going, you know, when was the last time the O.B. and Anthony Show got any kind of publicity, let alone this? 
[00:29:30]  Like, when was the last time major TV shows were covering stuff that O.B. and Anthony did?  Yeah, and especially in a way that's not like, they should be fired.  Like, just like, this is what happened.  It was noteworthy.  Well, I'll tell you, folks, I have the answer to that question.  Because it was the last time, actually, the video we took here in studio ended up all over TV of Breitbart. 
[00:30:00]  That's kind of what saved our asses, really.  The Colbert.  Yeah, Colbert played it, everyone.  The last time we were on a whole bunch of TV shows, I believe, if my memory serves me right,  was the last time one of our videos ended up on a whole bunch of TV shows.  And that was, and Roland, I don't know if, were you even here?  That was Sharon Osbourne and Bret Michaels in studio.  Right, that was before your time.  Sharon Osbourne and Bret Michaels were in studio.  And they were actually talking about, that was when they were on Celebrity Apprentice. 
[00:30:30]  So it was a while back at this point.  It was 2009.  So almost two years ago.  We've already seen a whole other season of Celebrity Apprentice.  I think this was right before they filmed the last task of Celebrity Apprentice.  They were promoting some kind of charity thing and they couldn't mention what it was.  Of course, they completely let the cat out of the bag.  But we didn't even get to spoil Celebrity Apprentice.  We thought that was what was going to make us news.  Instead, Jim had Sharon Osbourne, asked Sharon Osbourne a question about Susan Boyle, 
[00:31:00]  who was all over TV at that point.  You remember, she's the big, fat, ugly woman from America's Got Talent.  That scene's amazing, Oprah.  Hey, singing's amazing.  And she started talking about Susan Boyle and insulting her,  which people were surprised to hear from Sharon Osbourne,  who's this almost sweet motherly figure.  I mean, she's got a bit of a dark side, but she's like a sweet motherly figure on TV.  So she starts insulting, what's her name, Susan Boyle.  Well, we put the video out there, send it to a couple websites, and all of a sudden, 
[00:31:30]  it's Sharon Gate, Osbourne Gate, Boyle Gate.  I don't know what kind of gate.  I think it was Osbourne Gate on Extra.  Yeah, because it was all over Extra.  It was all over Access Hollywood.  All these TV shows, it was on TMZ.  It was, and I remember, it was that and the Jim Norton fight with Jesse Ventura that we got one after the other.  Both big news-making events.  But a lot of people didn't remember the Sharon Osbourne thing, and it was.  It was over every TV station. 
[00:32:00]  So I figured that we could share that with you today.  This is the Sharon Osbourne incident, as it happened, on the Opie and Anthony show, right here on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  I always found the best way to get a backstage pass is just stalk poor Ozzy until Sharon just feels sorry for you.  And calls her in Los Angeles and says, all right, you fucking weirdo, come on.  What the hell did you get back to this?  Eventually, she figured how it's better just to meet you and go.  Yeah, they get the fucking FBI profilers there taking notes. 
[00:32:30]  You know what, it's getting DNA off of you.  Anthony, I think we have audio of Jimmy, intro, and Ozzy.  No, we don't.  No, we don't.  Oh, my God.  I think Sharon has to be here.  Come on.  Let's hear it.  Hold on for a second.  I think we might.  I'm not sure if we've played this on the air yet.  Come on.  Listen to this.  Don't do it.  What happened was, when I was in Los Angeles, and I'm going to talk real slow, I would be happier 
[00:33:00]  right now, if they said, here's footage of Jim blowing a few people, I would feel less  embarrassed.  All right.  All right.  So then we've got that, too.  Sharon, there was an excitement factor when Jimmy introed your husband.  When Sharon knew, she was being very sweet.  She's like, do you want to bring Ozzy on?  And I'm like, you know, I meant to Jimmy.  I mean, you're the last person I have to tell of what a huge fan of Ozzy Jimmy is.  And do you know how you say, oh, cool?  Like, sometimes you don't have to be cool.  Like, just be yourself.  But there's a line between don't try to be cool and be a fucking 41-year-old slash teenage 
[00:33:30]  girl.  I really should have had on falsies.  What a fucking embarrassment I am.  Why don't we let Sharon and Brett Michaels hear this?  Sharon's already there.  Brett's busy.  No, Brett.  We've got to promote an event.  Brett, you want to hear this, right?  I can just keep talking.  Bring it, I'm ready.  There's no need for it, because I'm just.  Come on, let's hear it.  All right, here it is.  This is not it.  Are you ready?  Come on, you motherfuckers.  This isn't a Barry Lomba concert.  Are you ready? 
[00:34:00]  No, that's what I thought they were confused.  Let me hear you, guys, tonight.  I love me.  I love this boy.  See, Jimmy.  Jimmy knew what the way is.  Express Latin as that boy.  Jimmy didn't want the audience confused.  It's not a Barry Lomba concert.  It's not something new or not.  You see me looking at my ticket.  Hold on.  What the hell?  I want a Barry Lomba concert.  I thought he did bark at the moon.  That was simply for clarity.  That's all it was. 
[00:34:30]  I couldn't.  I just came out.  Sometimes you say something on Sunset Strip, and you can't take it back.  Was that near Tower Records by any chance?  It was actually farther down from Tower Records.  It was by the Key Club.  Key Club.  It was the Key Club.  Okay, got it.  And they, they, um, Sunset was all, you know, cordoned off, and everybody was performing  in the street.  It was unbelievable.  Then, Simon Cowell calls me the next day, and he lives in Beverly Hills, and he goes,  I was sat in my garden, and I heard this motherfucker introducing, oh, oh, oh, I'm sat, I'm sat 
[00:35:00]  outside by my fire pit with my girl drinking wine, and I'm getting down to it, and suddenly  I hear this motherfucker introducing RG fucking Osborne.  I'm like, I'm sorry, Simon.  Oh, I'm so happy.  That makes it worth it.  You know why he's a Barry Manilow fan?  I'm so happy. 
[00:35:30]  He had his hopes up.  Oh, goody.  That's so great.  That just turned me around on that.  Fantastic.  I just think it breaks the crowd like the words of Osborne.  You motherfuckers.  Oh, I'm so happy.  Oh, that's a good one.  He's there doing his, you know, big stud thing.  Yeah, yeah.  He's got the fire pit going, the wine, and he's just getting down to it.  Make that move, and then, ah!  Just so fucking happy to be there, weasel, screaming into a microphone that I was.  What a fucking worm.  God damn it.  I can't tell you how happy that makes me. 
[00:36:00]  Now it's good.  Jesus, I ruined the night of a mogul.  Brett enjoyed that.  Yes.  How's your nose, by the way?  It broke up pretty good, but much better now.  Oh, my God.  That's right.  Are you sick of seeing that footage?  You never can get sick of me smashing my head into an 800-pound wall.  That's classic.  Thank God, again, with the Internet, it just doesn't last very long.  No, no.  That clip will be a turn.  People forget.  People forget real quick.  You know what the good thing is?  There's a seven-second delay.  They'll never show this on TV, so I'm set. 
[00:36:30]  They'll put my nose back in.  Liza Minnelli will hand me a towel, as she always does after a show.  You know, and I will never forget the last words.  There's Elton John's getting yanked back, and the word the week before, I said, we should  never do, poison, nor I should ever do an award show.  We suck at them.  We fight.  Me and CeCe fought each other on stage.  Who does that?  I mean, it's an award show.  It's an award show.  We're like, I hate your...  We walk out, and they say, all you got to do is wave and walk backwards, right, at the  Tony's.  I'm like, all right.  And they say, never turn your back on the crowd. 
[00:37:00]  That's the whole thing.  I go, I have a quick question.  I'm at the front of the stage.  How do I know when it ended?  Like, how do I know when...  Yeah.  Like, do I just walk backwards until I'm out of sight?  What do I do?  And I turned around and headed backwards, and as I said, you rock, good night.  The next thing I know, my feet were above my head.  I was wearing a cowboy hat as a sombrero around my wiener, and it was just...  I mean, it was the most embarrassing, but I was so knocked out.  It's like innocently getting hit crossing the street.  There was no rhyme or reason to what happened.  You must have been like, what the fuck just happened to me? 
[00:37:30]  I looked up, and the thing...  They were trying to finish me off.  The thing keeps coming down.  Yeah.  I look up, and I see this...  I wish I could make this part up.  I'm going to tone it down.  There's monkey-like creatures, because there's some kind of offshoot of the Oz.  There's Shrek.  No one says, are you okay?  You know what they said?  Move out of the way.  We've got to go up next.  I'm like, I just...  My face...  Can I get my nose back from the other side of the stage?  It was unbelievable.  There's no words to describe the... 
[00:38:00]  I was too beat up to be embarrassed.  Oh, we saw it.  We saw it.  We saw it in slow motion.  Oh, yeah.  Freeze frame, rewind.  It was really...  Exactly.  I'm sure...  After 22 million hits on YouTube, I'm sure no one saw it.  That would be fine.  This rocker gets rocked in its next clip.  Oh, does he?  What is...  Oh, hey, Brad.  Hey, that's great.  And then everyone who made fun of me is like, dude, I was really...  I felt for you.  I'm like, that didn't sound like it on the radio.  You're like, look at this idiot.  His feet are above his head.  They freeze frame it.  My feet are like this. 
[00:38:30]  And that's it.  Let's move on.  You knocking yourself out made my intro of Ozzy look like fucking Martin Luther King speech.  Maria, you're feeling left out.  No, we love Maria.  No, not at all.  But I do wish I was there.  They are wonderful.  They made me laugh for the first time.  I think in probably two weeks.  Hallelujah.  Maria, let me tell you.  They wish you were here, too.  So let's just say, obviously, the three of you have just been getting together for just to be silly.  For no reason.  Plus for fun.  So you're just...  Shits and giggles. 
[00:39:00]  We do it every day.  We get nothing accomplished.  So it's basically you're all enjoying each other's company and hanging out and whatever.  You're all getting along well.  Yeah.  We love each other.  Absolutely.  I'm here for no other reason.  Did Ozzy come to New York with you, Sharon?  Yeah, Ozzy's here.  Is he sleeping?  Yeah, he is.  I know.  I hate when that happens.  I'm like leaving the room at seven this morning and he's like snoring up a storm.  I'm like, you bastard.  Lucky Ozzy. 
[00:39:30]  He doesn't need to see my face again.  Give him a break for a few months.  Poor guy just wants to relax and enjoy his family.  And I fuck his face on the side of the stage while you're doing...  What the hell?  Ozzy has nightmares that he takes the tin off the room service thing and it's my face smiling up at him.  Hi.  It's me again.  He is Ozzy's biggest fan.  There's no one bigger.  I know you've met him all over the years, but Jimmy's the biggest.  It was weird.  It was like this last time of doing the tribute and then intero.  It was the first time I met him where I didn't want a picture. 
[00:40:00]  It was like, you know, it's like...  You know, he gave Ozzy the best gift.  It was a picture of him and Ozzy backstage.  And it was a picture with your girlfriend, but he took his girlfriend out and superimposed Susan Boyle.  And you're in that picture, too.  It's us.  Susan Boyle.  That's actually on the...  I wish Danny could get up a screencast.  There's this great picture of Susan Boyle smiling, looking like a slapped ass, right next to Ozzy. 
[00:40:30]  A slapped ass.  Yeah, that really is a great shot.  What a great line.  That's a great line.  Oh, man.  Do you love Susan Boyle?  I mean, do you feel like she helped the show or not?  Or do you not love her?  Are you happy that she's succeeding?  Oh, I'm happy that she...  I like everybody to do well.  Yeah.  Even someone that looks like a slapped ass with a mustache.  It's like, God bless her.  What's that?  You go, girl.  She does look like a hairy arsehole. 
[00:41:00]  I don't know why they try to clean her up.  I mean, keep her how she was.  Wow, it's fantastic.  It's kind of hard to spin that.  What did you mean when you said she was a hairy asshole face?  Well, it was a spiritual comment.  I didn't mean it to be taken in a bad way.  No, and she is a lovely thing.  I would hope so.  Followed by God bless her heart.  God bless her.  No, you do.  You just want to say, God bless, and here's a Gillette razor.  I never noticed that she had facial hair. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, my God.  I couldn't get past the slow hair.  I couldn't get past the fucking Gene Wilder wig.  God bless her heart.  God bless her.  But we love her.  All that talent doesn't come without a price.  Wow.  God doesn't give everyone everything.  Absolutely.  Yeah, absolutely.  He gave her the talent.  He certainly did.  Yes, he did.  Really short-changed on the rest of it.  He hit her with the fucking ugly stick. 
[00:42:00]  He certainly did.  Holy Jesus.  Why are you holding back?  I don't understand.  Seriously, man.  Sharon, I need you to open up.  You've got to open up a little bit.  He gave Tiger Woods the ugly stick.  Could you knock this bitch around for a few hours?  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  You're starting to get better than that.  Wow, that is very refreshing.  Oh, God.  After ONA Live.  Sharon Osbourne was in a revealing mood that day. 
[00:42:30]  It's after Opie Anthony Live, and I'm Sam Roberts.  Roland, you would know, as the talent booker, by the way, I love that you just hang out in here.  Yeah.  Where else are you going to go, right?  I do.  As the talent booker, was there ever any backlash with that Sharon Osbourne thing?  Because she got a lot of negative publicity out of that.  Did she ever, like, not that you were there at the time.  But I think now she's more careful.  Like, last time when she really thought about what she's saying.  She's a little more careful, because all of a sudden she's saying she gets beat with the ugly stick.  She looks like a hairy asshole. 
[00:43:00]  No, God beat her with the ugly stick.  God beat her with the ugly stick.  I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have spoken out of turn there.  By the way, also, I wanted to mention, how much time do we have, Eric?  You've got about four minutes.  Oh, okay.  I thought we might have one minute, and then I would have had to speak much more quickly.  I did want to mention that E-Rock reminded me, the Sex Man reminded me while we were playing the Bobo bit,  that Bobo Springsteen, that bit, is where the old suicide bit came from, 
[00:43:30]  which everybody loves, where Big A is in it and Bobo is in it.  It's a very long production piece, but it's worth every second.  Yeah, it's episodic at this point, so it was worth something in the end.  And it also leads me to say that I've heard rumors that there's another Bobo, suicide-like Bobo production piece in the work.  Have you heard anything about this, E-Rock?  I heard it's epic. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah, I've heard...  I think he has voices.  I've heard it's on the level of suicide.  Multiple voices.  I've heard multiple voices.  I've heard celebrity voices beyond this show.  This is something that's been in the works for a while now,  so I'm assuming that when this comes down, it's going to hit everybody like a ton of bricks.  And by a ton of bricks, I mean humor bricks that make everybody laugh when they hit them.  Have you heard anything about this, Roland? 
[00:44:30]  Have you voiced anything for it?  No, but I heard about it.  E-Rock, did you voice anything for this?  Not yet, but soon.  You have a part in this?  I believe so.  Yeah, he's the sex man.  He's the sex man.  Does the sex man have a role?  Maybe I'm a villain.  I don't know.  Named the sex man.  But, I mean, I don't want to give too much away.  I really want to talk about what I've heard it is.  But I feel like Danny and Derek, who've been working diligently on this, would want it to be a surprise.  Like Super 8.  Like, very much like Super 8. 
[00:45:00]  I haven't seen it yet.  Have you?  Yeah.  I'm going to guess that you're going to give it a positive review.  It was good.  What's the monster look like?  It's not a monster.  It's an alien.  What's the alien look like?  Was Super 8 good?  It was good.  I mean, it was a fun movie.  It wasn't that great.  But tomorrow, I'm taking Opi.  We're going to see Cars 2 tomorrow in 3D.  Well, I mean, are you bringing your children with you?  Cars 2?  It's awesome.  I guess.  But you didn't like Super 8.  It was good. 
[00:45:30]  It was fun.  But you are very over the top with your positive reviews.  So you saying that means it wasn't a very good movie.  It was a fun movie.  It was good.  What were some of the flaws with Super 8?  I don't know.  It's just like a fun movie.  Was it better than Cloverfield?  Yeah.  You didn't like Cloverfield?  I did like Cloverfield.  Do you think Super 8 was better than Cloverfield?  It's a totally different movie, though.  It doesn't seem totally different at all.  They're both J.J. Abrams monster movies.  How can you say they're totally different? 
[00:46:00]  What's the alien look like?  Oh, wow.  No spoilers.  I should have told everybody to turn off their radios first.  By the way, we are reading feedback.  And we do have to play the Jim-Jesse Ventura fight sometime.  Because I thought people had...  What did you say, Eric?  Again?  Actually, I thought that people had heard it by now.  Look, it's a great piece of audio.  We've played it a lot, though.  Is Spencer getting ready for the big celebrity that's coming here today?  Yes.  We're not saying who it is, are we? 
[00:46:30]  Oh.  Star of Independence Day.  Jeff Goldblum is coming here?  Shit.  If I had known that...  See, my professor in college was RoboCop, and he used to brag that he was in a jazz band  with Jeff Goldblum.  I would have tried to get a record that they put together and get Jeff Goldblum to sign it.  But it's not Jeff Goldblum.  It's not Jeff Goldblum.  Well, I got all excited for nothing, then.  Pretty much.  We said the name earlier.  We did?  Jada Pinkett Smith. 
[00:47:00]  She was in Independence Day?  Who?  Yeah, Matrix.  No, that's Matrix.  Yeah.  In what?  I hear Liam.  Liam, come in the studio if you're going to talk.  Sam wants to talk to you.  Go in the studio.  And weren't we talking about this?  No, she wasn't in...  We weren't talking about this on the air.  I think Vindica Fox was in ID4.  No, we weren't.  Eric, are you a professional?  Yeah.  I try to be.  Well, how long have you been in radio?  Too long, some would say.  And you don't know the difference between a conversation that we had while a bit was playing  versus a conversation we had on the air?  No, we said it on the air. 
[00:47:30]  Remember?  We said she was going to Hits 1.  Roland, did you say Jada Pinkett Smith on the air?  Roland wasn't here yet.  Oh, you said...  Who said Jada Pinkett Smith then?  Me.  She's coming on the shit show?  That's what I'm trying to arrange.  No, you were trying to see about other celebrities coming in.  I said, oh, there's one coming in.  But Jada Pinkett Smith wasn't in Independence Day?  I got it confused.  She was in Matrix.  Vivica Fox was in...  Right.  What's similar about Jada Pinkett Smith and Vivica A. Fox?  They're both very pretty ladies.  Yes, very.  One of the great actresses...  Roland goes a certain age.  Don't ruin this booking.  One of the great actresses, the other one's... 
[00:48:00]  Oof.  Liam.  That's Vivica.  I don't...  The oof one.  Yeah.  Not good?  Not good.  But Jada Pinkett Smith in The Matrix is pretty good, right?  No, Jada I love.  But Vivica A. Fox.  Vivica A. Fox.  Terrible, you think?  She played a great stripper.  I'll say girlfriend?  Mm-mm.  Wow.  So, Liam, I'm glad you're here just for a second before we have to turn it over to  Ron and Fez, because I was talking to the guys on the air today about what a panic you  were in when Anthony called Loverboy and started asking if he ate the band and making 
[00:48:30]  gay jokes because...  Fat.  Fat jokes.  Fat.  Like a million cookies.  Right.  I see you listen to Special Delivery.  Right.  Because Hall & Oates, same publicist.  Same publicist.  And that's not a relationship...  And they're not an easy band to book.  Well, Opie goes, well, what are we going to talk to Hall & Oates about anyway?  And I said, it's a platform!  Yeah, it's a whole company here.  Which Opie and, you know, Opie should have.  He corrected me.  Right.  And said, the Opie and Anthony show is the platform.  Oh, it is the platform.  I said, okay, you're right.  Oh, that's fine.  That's fair.  You're right.  Yeah.  All right, well, we do need to give it over to Ron and Fez, correct, Eric? 
[00:49:00]  You're not queuing me.  We're in overtime.  And I'm sorry I accused you of things.  I've gotten two things wrong today.  Liam, I almost got into trouble.  What happened?  Well, I said Clarence Clemens was dead.  Oh.  He's not dead.  He just had a stroke.  Just a stroke.  He's not going to play anymore, probably.  He could play.  He might play.  Isaac Hayes performed after he had a stroke.  So what's everybody making a big deal about today, then?  Because he's a big man.  Brett Hart came back after a stroke.  There it is.  He ain't wrestling no more.  Let me tell you that.  Steven Adler?  Stroke?  Yeah, obviously.  This has been After Opie and Anthony Live.  Stay tuned. 
[00:49:30]  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time. </pre>
