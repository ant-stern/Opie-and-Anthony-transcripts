<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a whimsical debate on the hypothetical rules of heaven and hell, transitioning quickly to a real-life account of a car accident near the studio witnessed by the hosts and their waiting fans.  The conversation then veered into a discussion of their past on-air stunts and anxieties about future mishaps, particularly now that they were off the premium channel.  Anthony confessed to struggling with an online poker addiction, and the hosts shared their own disastrous investment stories, including Opie's woes with Dell stock.  A substantial portion of the show focused on Howard Stern's move to satellite radio, with Opie and Anthony offering their predictions for audience numbers.  They extensively played and commented on listener-created remixes of Pat O'Brien's leaked sex tapes, also discussing the "Smack Fest" controversy on Hot 97, drawing parallels to their own "blind boxing" segment, and revisiting the Terry Schiavo case.  A caller accused Howard Stern of stealing the "Smack Fest" concept and the "Butt Bongo" bit, prompting further accusations of plagiarism against Stern.  Guest appearances included Ben ("Herky Jerky Man") and Drew Boogie, who mixed live in the studio.

The show continued with more sexually explicit phone messages, one attributed to an intern, Nathaniel, potentially leading to his dismissal.  Another message was attributed to "Wheelchair Fred" and Pat O'Brien.  The discussion included graphic details of Pat O’Brien’s sex tape and the host's own past experiences with self-recorded masturbation. In-studio guests included Dallas Cowboys center Tyson Walters, who discussed NFL fines for weight issues and the culture of the league compared to baseball, and Bob Kelly, filling in for Jim Norton, who promoted his comedy tour.  A listener called in whose cousin was facing a difficult divorce because of her wife's mental state.  The show featured numerous sexually explicit listener calls and further remixes of the Pat O'Brien tapes, including a replay of a previous "Bill's Dead" prank call. Jim Norton called in from Florida, detailing his stand-up gigs, a negative hotel experience, and a humorous incident during a country radio appearance.  The segment included a particularly graphic message labeled "Danny the Intern's Ladies' Creation."

A woman's explicit monologue opened another segment, followed by more Pat O'Brien sex tape remixes, some praised, others criticized.  Drew Boogie was mentioned as being in the studio. The hosts discussed upcoming vacations and interacted with callers, including a recurring bit with Waldo.  Red contributed a remix, and a previous "Hi Mom, I'm in porno" prank call was played.  Mike from Staten Island called, rambling about the Howard Stern Show and the absence of Dice.  Dede, a traffic reporter, graphically recounted a sexual encounter with her UPS delivery person, which was corroborated by a former UPS driver, Tom, who added anecdotes about his own experiences.  Further calls included stories about encounters with elderly women and flight attendants.  The segment concluded with a Paisano's Mulberry Street restaurant commercial and a discussion about a recent encounter with Gene Simmons.

The final segment recounted a Turks and Caicos vacation, detailing a "party boat" incident involving excessive drinking, passed-out boyfriends, and alleged fondling.  The hosts expressed anger towards the allegedly drunk boat captain.  They discussed the perceived naïveté of women on vacation, a mugging in New York City, and a listener’s comparison of "Along Came Polly" to their Club Med experiences.  More Pat O’Brien sex tape remixes were played. Ozzy Osbourne called in, expressing his enjoyment of the show.  The hosts promoted upcoming live shows, thanked their staff, and ended the broadcast.

[00:07:30]  Yeah, do they get out? 
[00:08:00]  So do they get like a reprieve?  A reprieve?  Yeah.  No.  No, they're still in.  Because the rules were set at that time?  Yeah, what happens?  You screw up.  You screw up.  You screw up.  You screw up.  You screw up.  You screw up.  You screw up.  You screw up.  You screw up.  You screw up.  You didn't atone for your sins.  And you go to hell because of some little problem that the religion had years back.  But now everything's cool.  They changed the rules.  You get out of hell.  They can't have some kind of red tape thing like that in hell.  The heaven-hell thing.  I think it would be pretty definite.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:08:30]  Well, someone almost...  One of those mysterious things we'll never know about.  Someone almost went to heaven or hell this morning.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Yeah.  Huge accident right in front of the building today.  Yeah.  I wonder if Master Poe thought it was my cab.  Because I pulled up right after the accident.  I extricated the people.  I did not see Opie in there.  Yeah.  No, it was a wreck right in front of the building.  Right in front of the building.  And we got these hardcore fans that hang outside the building every morning.  The EMT guys or whatever. 
[00:09:00]  EMTs.  Sometimes they give me a lift from the garage if they're passing by.  They're out there just about every morning.  And then there's others that come by and say hi every once in a while.  But these two guys are there literally every morning just waiting for us.  They just want to see us walk into the building.  It's very strange.  They hang out there waiting for calls and stuff.  But they also went to the road show and helped us out.  Yep.  They determined that it was okay for that guy to swallow the butter knife, by the way.  They wanted to see it.  But no, Jim Norton, the voice of reason.  No, guys, you can't do that.  Thank God.  I could talk about girls shitting on my chest. 
[00:09:30]  But no, don't let a guy swallow a butter knife.  Girls crapping on him isn't going to get us put in jail, Opie.  If he dropped dead on that stage because he slid his throat open as he's swallowing a knife, we could be in trouble.  I think it was a good call.  Yeah, but you guys are just getting silly with your thinking.  No, no, no.  Not you guys.  You know damn well that we will blow this up again.  So why are you even...  I just don't want to do it now.  Why are you making believe that we've learned our lesson and that someday is never going to happen? 
[00:10:00]  I'd rather wait.  You know, silly me.  I'd kind of like to see what it's like when we're off the premium channel.  Okay.  Silly me.  I guess that's a nice goal to have.  Can you do that for a little bit?  Sure.  I'm with you there.  Take a stab at that one.  They're putting all these things in place to protect us, and I just laugh at all of it  because I know someday something stupid will happen that we weren't thinking of.  Oh, I have no illusions that we're going to end any other way, but...  And then it'll be over, Johnny.  And then we'll just have the memories. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  And the file sharing.  We'll show memories and bits on the computer.  That's right.  And people will start up their old Opie and Anthony stations.  Yeah.  So anyway, there was a pretty good accident right in front of the building.  What happens every morning, my cabbie does it as well.  He drops me off, and then he U-turns.  Yeah.  Because it's 57th Street, and I guess going that way is not a good idea for getting other  fares.  Uh-huh.  So these people always U-turn.  Yeah, but the cab didn't U-turn this time.  The lady in the little car did? 
[00:11:00]  The woman driver.  Oh, boy.  If you're going to...  You know, I never understood this.  If you're going to make a U-turn anywhere, but especially on a city street like 57th Street,  even that early in the morning, not many cars, but...  If you're making a U-turn anywhere, wouldn't you absolutely make...  Make sure that no one's coming?  Wouldn't that be like, I'm making a U-turn here.  I'm not supposed to do it.  It's a dangerous maneuver anyway.  I really had better look and make sure no one's coming?  Yeah.  So how do you get hit when you're making a U-turn? 
[00:11:30]  If that's the one time you really should be looking out extra special.  She got nailed, though.  The jerk-offs are always doing this.  So she decides she's going to make a U-turn, and some taxi is going down the road, and  smashed right into her.  Kind of hit her in the side of the vehicle, the passenger side, right up by the front,  by the engine.  It just wiped out her car.  It was bent.  Her whole car was bent.  The front was just smashed.  Well, a huge piece of the front came off.  Yeah, it came off.  The cab blew two tires from the energy of the impact. 
[00:12:00]  The cab slid along the road and blew two tires on one side of the car.  Everybody's hanging out.  So I'm walking down the road, and I see the ambulance lights flashing from our EMT pals.  And yeah, they're talking to people, making sure they're okay.  Got the cops on the scene, and Poe was right there on the scene.  And so if anybody needed an ass-kicking, you know. 
[00:12:30]  He was ready.  He was ready to deliver.  He sure was ready.  But whether it was ever fault the accident was, he should have been pulled from the vehicle  and beaten.  Did you say vehicle?  The vehicle.  Should have been pulled from the vehicle.  Vehicle.  Vehicle.  Can you tell we're hours away from vacation?  Hours away.  We warned you guys.  We warned you.  And I really need a nap.  Really?  I was, you know, you said there's going to be a problem.  By the way, just to finish up the story, everyone's okay out there.  Yeah. 
[00:13:00]  It's an absolute mess, but everyone's okay.  Go ahead, Anthony.  You said that there's going to be a problem.  I started noticing a problem last night.  I knew it was getting a little late.  It was about a quarter after 11, which is pretty late for me.  I'm used to going to bed at 10 these days.  Going to sleep at least at 10.  So it's like a quarter after 11.  I have the 2004 World Poker Championship on the TV, and I'm laying down, and on my laptop  next to the bed, I'm playing. 
[00:13:30]  I'm playing some poker.  So I'm watching poker.  I'm playing poker, and I'm not sleeping.  And I'm like, oh, this is a real problem now.  This is turning into a problem.  Damn it!  Because I know what the next step is.  What?  Right here.  Playing while we're on the air.  No, I refuse to put it on any of these screens.  I have four screens here in front of me.  One has all the instant feedback and various websites I visit through the show.  The other one is the phones, so I can see who's calling. 
[00:14:00]  The other two screens, devoid of any information whatsoever.  At any time, I could pop up the poker game on one of these screens and perhaps get a couple  of hands in during a commercial break.  The hardcore listeners, they understand what this is all about.  Yeah.  Because in the old days, Anthony used to day trade during the show.  It was so ugly.  It got to a point he wasn't even listening anymore.  No.  And still doing great radio, which just amazed me.  Well, we were on, and from 3 to 4, 4 o'clock, the market closed.  I was then completely available for the program after 4. 
[00:14:30]  But between 3 and 4, it was very rough for me to concentrate on the show.  Yeah.  And a lot of people were like, ha, ha, you guys just make things up for the radio.  Ha, ha.  Yeah.  No, trust me.  It was a really bad scene.  Oh, I'm supposed to be show prepping, and I'm watching Alan Greenspan's speeches.  I was just a mess.  You know, that phenomenon got so crazy that I was even following the ticker every day.  Everybody was.  Every day.  And I'm punching in, and Anthony's helping me do a little trading here and there.  Oh, we used to go back and forth.  What do you think?  What do you think?  Biome.  What do you think?  Biome.  How is that going?  How is that working?  How is that going? 
[00:15:00]  You still on Biome?  I sure do.  How's that working out for you?  Oh, I got it at 11.  It's like two.  I have a couple of stocks that I got in at like seven, or got in at nine, and they're  in the fractions of pennies right now.  Yeah.  They're making a comeback.  There's a lot of dopey stockbrokers out there.  If you're legit, I'm not talking about you, but you guys know about your business.  There's a lot of asses out there that are pushing stocks that they have no business pushing.  Crap.  Pump and dump, they call them.  And I met this guy from Merrill Lynch that did a lot of work when the two companies merged 
[00:15:30]  that we were working for.  Yep.  And so I said, you know, he helped me out with my little stock thing that I had with  the company.  Was it Ziggy from Merrill Lynch, P.S.  Fenner, and Ziggy?  Yeah.  So I'm like, yeah, might as well give this guy business.  I'm doing a little better these days.  I got some money to invest.  This guy is just the stupidest man alive.  He could be with me now.  And now I got a guy that I really, really trust.  And we're doing some very conservative stuff.  Conservative, very diversified, our portfolios. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, yeah.  We have the same guy now.  Yeah, we have the same guy.  But very diversified portfolio.  But this guy was one step above boiler room crap.  Yeah.  And he took advantage of me and said, no, you really need to buy a bunch of stocks.  And they all were just disasters.  And I'm talking, this is six, seven years ago, and they ain't going anywhere.  So don't even tell me that they're supposed to and all that crap.  How long did you have to sit on Dell to break even?  Oh, yeah.  He wanted me to buy Dell at 52.  Couldn't believe I wasn't going to buy it at 52.  Years ago, right?  Right.  So then I bought it at 38, finally, through the same guy. 
[00:16:30]  And then it was down into the low 20s for years.  For years.  You sat on Dell for years.  For years.  And now I think I'm about even with Dell.  Yeah.  Finally, seven years later.  Seven years.  What an investment.  And seven years to be even.  And I understand there's no real science to this.  So, okay, that's one stock.  But I'm telling you, the portfolio he suggested, nothing but crap.  Not one winner in the bunch.  And the stock market has turned around.  So don't even tell me it's the 9-11 and all that bullshit.  Yeah.  I follow it every day.  Well, it was all that stuff, the tech stocks and everything that were, they called it the 
[00:17:00]  bubble back then.  And everyone was jumping on board.  No one thought it was going to run out.  And a lot of these brokers would call you up and go, oh, you got to buy this.  You know, some dot-com company.  Yeah.  And it just sucked.  Yeah, so he got me into a bunch of crappy stocks.  One that doesn't, you can't even look up the symbol.  No, it's gone.  What the hell was that again?  I finally got rid of that one.  It was some kind of internet company in the Far East or something.  It was supposed to be, yeah, an internet company that was opening up in Asia. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  And it was supposed to be the AOL of Asia this guy was pitching it at.  So we bought a few shares, you know, pretty cheap.  And, you know, I lost some money through this guy.  And if he got a nice little payday, great.  But if he was just honest and smarter and did the right thing, he could be my guy right  now doing much better.  So whatever.  I'm very safe these days.  But anyway, the video poker is the next stage for you.  Yeah, online, a little poker.  I'm pretty cheap with it, though.  I only go into, like, the $10 tournament rooms. 
[00:18:00]  So it's not bad.  You play for a long time.  And if you lose, you're only losing $10.  But you really learn a lot.  And I get mad.  Like, it's only $10, but I'm like, son of a bitch.  I'm out of the money.  You really got to start playing with live people, though.  That's the next step.  I will.  I've noticed I'm getting better.  I'm getting much better.  My play is a lot more aggressive these days.  I'm in the money a lot of times.  You know, I'm either first, second, or third.  So I'm in the money.  I'm making, you know, my money back at the very least.  Yeah.  But, yeah, it's getting an education. 
[00:18:30]  And then when I play with live people every so often, I'm better.  I'm thinking it's the day before vacation.  I can't believe I'm going to suggest this.  Yeah.  Because I think this is, like, me being the pusher man.  Uh-huh.  But I'm thinking maybe you'd play a little poker.  You think I should boot up here?  The day before vacation.  Boot up a little.  It's vacation.  How could it hurt?  How could it possibly hurt the program if I play a couple of hands, just maybe during commercial?  Fast forward two weeks, and you're just rocked.  I can't.  What, Opie? 
[00:19:00]  What?  I'm like, what?  Shut up.  I'm waiting for the flop.  I don't know what that is.  Come on.  Oh, fold, fold, fold.  I'm told I have nothing.  Fold.  Let's go to Long Island.  Paul, what's up?  Yeah, Duchenheimer was talking about you guys again.  What was he saying this time?  Something went down, like in 1997, at some sort of flop fest.  And then he said, you know, I told Mel Comison that his boys would self-destruct, and they did.  And it's just going on and on and on again.  I mean, self-destruct. 
[00:19:30]  We never, well, I guess we self-destructed for a while there.  Sure.  We've always done that.  Yeah, I mean, he's always self-destructed.  He's the one that predicted it, and he's like, the originator in the whole industry.  Oh, God, that speech again.  So what you're telling us is Howard's in best of?  Jesus Christ, how many times have we heard that speech?  Yeah.  Hey, Opie, don't feel bad.  I bought Lucent at 65.  It's now like 350.  Oh, yeah.  No, I know everyone has a story out there.  I understand that.  I mean.  Fucking ridiculous. 
[00:20:00]  Because, you know, you trust a lot of these guys, because you don't know the business,  and you have a little money.  You're like, oh, really?  Okay, I'll go with that.  And they know that.  Think of those people that just recently bought Sirius when it was over nine bucks a share.  Right.  You know, they bought in going, oh, you did?  What'd you buy it in?  At?  890.  890.  It's going up.  It's going to 15, guys.  Here we go.  Hold on.  We're getting ready for the ride.  Here comes the big ride up.  You read the message, boys?  Oh, yeah.  It's hysterical.  Here we go.  Strap in, people.  Let's see.  Five bucks. 
[00:20:30]  See, we have some expertise in this sector, and there's no inside trading or any of that.  It's just that we understand how XM works and Sirius works.  Anyone can get the info.  Yeah, of course.  It's just basic technology.  And I can't tell you how many of my friends and family called me up going, wow, you know,  XM is over 30, and Sirius is at four.  Well, it's two satellite companies, so Sirius has to go up to 30, right?  Yeah.  This is a no-brainer, right?  I'm like, oh, my God.  Slow the fuck down.  Yeah.  Sirius will never, never get up to where XM is. 
[00:21:00]  No.  I don't know.  You guys watch that show Deadwood and HBO?  Yeah, it's pretty good.  Yeah, fucking elsewhere's in the rocks.  How about he had his kidney stones or something in the last episode, and the doctor, this  Old West doctor, takes this probe that is just huge and has to stick it up his peenie  hole and feel around for the stones.  He was letting out screams that had me, like, cringing.  Tell that chink boss we'll get one cocksucker. 
[00:21:30]  And I've never heard the C word used on any other program as much as it's used.  I've never heard it used.  But on that show, they throw the C word around like it's of.  Yeah.  It's just always out there.  Hey, Paul, just to finish up the Howard crap, you know, he was so obsessed with us when we  were working for the same company.  He was having closed-door meetings with Mel Carmson all the time about Anthony and I.  He just did not want us to get big within the same company.  And it's a fact.  This is a fact.  When Howard goes to satellite radio, Opie and Anthony will have a bigger audience. 
[00:22:00]  A much bigger audience.  That's right.  A much bigger audience.  I remember when you let you guys say Howard K. Stern when you're talking about freaking  Anna Nicole's lawyer.  Yeah, we couldn't even talk about Anna Nicole's lawyer.  They dumped out of us.  Right.  Her lawyer's name is Howard Stern.  And we pushed that whole thing right to the edge where they were going to fire us.  They were going to fire us.  And then they realized, well, if we fire them, they'll go across the street and then  they'll give Howard a real problem.  So they said, we're going to fire Ken Stevens. 
[00:22:30]  Right.  And Jeremy.  Right.  If you mentioned his name.  And there we are sitting there.  We like Ken, so.  You know, Howard just didn't do his research when it came to the satellite radio thing.  He has no idea what he's getting himself into.  Sure, he's going to get a great payday and we all would love that.  But from a creative standpoint and having an actual audience to talk to, unless they  make some crazy deal with commercial radio, the fact is we will have a much bigger audience  than Howard when it goes to the satellite. 
[00:23:00]  Absolutely.  Sirius stock, I guess, is at $5.33 now.  Oh, really?  People bought in at, you know, $9 a share and thought it was going up.  They get so worked up in that they get like Pat O'Brien, all frothing and worked up on  those message boards, it's going to the top, guys.  Here we go.  Next stop, $15.  I've noticed we've passed that resistance marker that we were feeling at $8.50 and now  we should have smooth sailing up to $19 a share. 
[00:23:30]  And everyone starts going, oh, I've got to get in.  Yeah, no.  And they got in.  Wah, wah.  They took a crap.  Yeah, I mean, you can't just look at it and say, well, the two companies are equal,  so this is how it's going to happen.  No.  The two companies are just not equal.  Sirius has so many shares out there, it's like having a stock that is worth $2 and having  a stock that's worth 100 pennies.  And you'll go, well, I want the one with 100.  But no, that's just pennies.  It doesn't amount to that. 
[00:24:00]  That's pretty much the same way it works out with Sirius and XM.  They have so many shares out there that it can't possibly, the financials don't add up.  Nope.  Nope.  I saved a lot of people a lot of money, so let's go to Georgia.  Floyd, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  I hope you're Anthony.  Hey, how are you, Floyd?  Floyd from Georgia.  I'm all right.  I'm just fine.  All right, good.  I want to tell you all to have a good holiday.  Oh, thank you.  You need to take a break so the competition can catch up with you.  What do you mean?  Oh, there you go. 
[00:24:30]  There's a radio show, Lex and Terry are out of Jacksonville.  Yeah, we know about Lex and Terry.  These guys never really made it.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, they got syndicated a little bit in, like, media markets, but they never made the  big time, and they're very frustrated by that, by the way.  I drive a semi, and I parked my truck, and I was driving home, and I figured, well, I'll  listen to the local station, you know.  But I couldn't take it, man.  They were just now touching on the Pat O'Brien story.  Just now getting on it. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, because it took that long to edit it.  Yeah, I got to tell you a couple things about the Pat O'Brien sex tapes.  When we played it about three days ago, maybe, four days, I don't even know, I just assumed,  because it is radio, and we're all searching for stuff on a daily basis, I just assumed  that everyone had the tapes, you know?  Because that is what we call radio gold in the business.  Yeah, this is no-brainer stuff.  When you have audio like this, and you're on a radio show, you're going to play it.  It's amazing audio.  So when we were playing it, I'm just assuming, ah, everyone's playing it, you know, and it 
[00:25:30]  turns out no one was really playing the audio.  We heard Imus was, but now people are starting to play it.  You know why?  They're petrified.  Even bleeped.  They're petrified that the content itself is going to get them a fine or a complaint.  So all the shows go, hey, can we play this?  And their PDs go, I don't know, let me talk to the GM.  GM is like, I don't know, let me talk to the lawyer.  So it takes so long to even start playing it, and then a lot of times the lawyers come  back and go, no, what are you, crazy? 
[00:26:00]  In today's climate with radio, we can't possibly play that.  Even bleeped.  Even bleeped, you can't play it because it's still putting across the idea of, you know,  BJs and threesomes and sex and drugs.  So a lot of these shows want to play it, can't play it, can't play it, want to play  it, can't play it.  Elo called yesterday.  He's in the middle of another huge deal for XM somewhere, and he called me up.  He's signing junior high school kickball?  Probably.  Is that what it is?  I think he's signing the dodgeball league. 
[00:26:30]  They're going to get that red ball sound?  Right.  Boom.  Boom.  Boom.  I love the red ball.  We will be the exclusive home for the dodgeball league.  Boom.  Boom.  Boom.  But he called and he said, guys, what you guys have been doing with the Pat O'Brien  sex tape, some of the funniest stuff I've heard in recent years.  How could you not love the Pat O'Brien sex tape?  And then he got the marketing department and the PR firms and all that that are associated  with XM to just alert the media that this is the only place you can hear the Pat O'Brien 
[00:27:00]  sex tapes unedited.  Yeah, who else is playing them?  Nobody.  No one.  No one like we are.  That must just, you know how much we would be freaking out to have that audio?  We'd be fired.  I'm sure we would have been fired like plenty of times before this if we were on terrestrial  radio.  Yeah.  But this is one of those instances where we would be fired because we would have gotten  the audio.  And you know us.  We'd have been worked up just like Pat O'Brien.  Oh, yeah.  And we would have had to have gone on the air and played the audio. 
[00:27:30]  Wait, Ben.  I'm dead serious.  Ben, breaking news.  Ben's in the studio.  The Herky Jerky Man.  Yes, Ben.  I just got that.  That's what he's claiming.  He invented Smack Fest.  Howard is claiming he invented Smack Fest.  What?  Yeah, he's claiming he did that years ago, I guess.  A couple of listeners.  Well, Hot 97 in New York City.  In trouble again.  You know, the home of the Tsunami song.  Well, they've been doing this thing called Smack Fest.  And I guess the Boxing Commission wants to, what, they're going to go after the radio  station and sue them because they said that it's an illegal boxing match? 
[00:28:00]  It's an illegal boxing match.  Do you know what the hell goes on in these boxing leagues?  Yeah, all kinds of crime.  State officials yesterday ordered Hot 97 to stop its controversial Smack Fest in which  women wallop each other in the face.  The girl-on-girl contest, which sometimes draw blood, amount to an illegal boxing match that  could lead Hot 97 officials to be charged with a crime, the State Athletic Commission  said, Anthony.  I got to tell you, I saw a video of this, and I got to give it to Hot 97.  That is one of the best goddamn contests I've ever seen in my life. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, the New York Post.  These two broads just smacking each other so hard in the face.  Until one can't take it anymore, I guess.  And then they win all sorts of prizes.  The New York Post, page three today.  Hot 97's vicious Smack Fest KO'd.  And I saw our own pal Rick Delgado in the background on one of these clips.  Yeah.  Being the referee.  Hey, it's just a great radio bit.  It really is good.  But the Boxing Commission is going after them, saying it's an illegal boxing match.  That's ridiculous.  They face a $10,000 civil fine if it continues, Anthony. 
[00:29:00]  How can it be an illegal boxing match?  They said it's...  There's no ring.  There's no gloves.  There's...  Cash prizes.  They say it's a New York state law barring unlicensed fights.  So it's some kind of fight.  Technically, if it wasn't illegal, you could have people come up and just beat the crap  out of each other until one, you know, is dead.  Right.  You know, so I guess there are laws in place to keep this from happening. 
[00:29:30]  I don't know.  Is it the money that's the problem?  Is there a prize involved?  And that's why there's a problem?  What about our blind boxing?  And would that be considered illegal?  We had two blind guys.  One, not even just blind.  He didn't have eyeballs.  He, like, took his glasses off and it was just ditches in his head.  You could have been fined for that?  I'm thinking because we did give away prizes and there were rounds and we set these blind  guys in a ring, pretty much.  Can we get the video back up on Foundry Music?  I love that one.  I think it is there somewhere.  I know, but you've got to go look for it. 
[00:30:00]  I'm thinking, you know, make it a headline because our blind boxing was legendary.  I love that.  Two blind guys, we ring the bell and they would just walk into the middle of the ring,  kind of moving their fists, but they didn't know where each other was.  So they'd start swinging wildly at any little sound.  They would be back-to-back swinging, thinking the guy's in front of them.  The guy's behind him and he's throwing right hooks and stuff.  And then all of a sudden they would feel the other boxer and all hell would break loose  for about 15 seconds and we'd have to stop the round.  But God forbid somebody around the ring would make a sound and they would lunge at the noise 
[00:30:30]  and go punching at some of the spectators.  Speaking of someone almost dying on our show, Blind Dave almost died that day.  Yeah, he got the crap beat out of him.  He got the crap beat out of him.  He had a, I'm trying to remember all his injuries.  He had like four cracked ribs, a bruised spleen or something.  Dave listens to the show.  Maybe he could call in with all his injuries, but he was in the hospital.  We gave him all sorts of booze to help the pain after the boxing match.  Remember that, Ben?  Yeah, he was drunk out of his mind.  He was hammered just getting the shit beat out of him by this guy, Blind Matt, who had 
[00:31:00]  no eyes.  None.  He popped him out for the match even.  No eyeball.  He was a good-looking guy.  Blind Matt was picking up chicks.  Remember he came to one of our events?  He couldn't really tell.  He was blind.  He was the one that popped the eyes out.  Yeah, until he took his glasses off.  Wow.  That's a guy that, I mean, he's, I learned a lot from that guy.  He just loves being alive.  And he has such a crazy handicap.  I can't imagine having no eyes whatsoever.  No vision.  And he doesn't even care. 
[00:31:30]  He rides the trains.  He's got his dog and he's drinking and going to bars and stuff.  So, but that was an amazing, amazing day.  I could have gotten us fined, I guess.  But Howard invented SmackFest now.  He invented SmackFest?  You've got to think his hardcore listeners at this point are like, oh my God.  Even the hardcore ones now have got to go, oh my God, this tool.  He's becoming a parody of himself.  Yeah.  I did that first, Robin.  You put a bandana on your car and punch each other. 
[00:32:00]  You know, there's a list, there's a list of things that Howard does on his show that  he stole from other jocks.  That's the, that's the funniest thing of all.  Yep.  It's kind of like, you know, the guy that, that screams the loudest about something usually  means that he does it the worst.  Yep.  You know what I mean?  Yep.  Ask Howard where he got Butt Bongo Fiesta from.  Butt Bongo.  Let's just start there.  Go call him up right now and ask him where he got that idea from.  And that was huge for him.  He had a video or a, what was it?  Like a, was it pay-per-view or a video? 
[00:32:30]  I don't know.  It was like a video that came out.  Pay-per-view first and then it came out on video.  Well, it was a huge bit for his show.  But I remember listening years ago and I heard this.  I mean, I, I used to be a fan.  Of course, I listened, you know, every day when I was working out on Long Island.  Everyone did.  He was huge.  And I remember some, some guy called up and gave it and told him the idea for this Butt  Bongo thing.  Just bringing girls in, playing music and bongoing on their ass and saying that he heard  two jocks up in Maine doing it. 
[00:33:00]  Well, that's what Howard used to do back in the days before the internet and stuff.  You know, he would find out what jocks are doing all over the country in tiny little  markets where no one would call him out on it.  And he would take these bits and make them his own in New York City.  And then turns around and screams and yells that everyone's ripping them off.  Because he's paranoid that he's, that people are going to find out about what he's been  doing over the years.  Two poor bastards in Maine.  Came up with the bit.  Came up with it.  And they got no credit.  And Howard made tons of money off that.  He just took it.  Didn't even change the name.  They had called it Butt Bongo. 
[00:33:30]  Because it was a, they would just get girls to come in their studio, play music and bongo  on their asses.  And he took the whole thing.  So what about that?  Did he invent that too?  You know, and that's just one instance.  I mean, if you are a hardcore fan, those are the ones that should really know.  Because they're the ones that listened and heard all this stuff.  He also likes to claim that he invented lesbianism on radio.  Yeah, there you go.  Oh my God.  Slow down.  Slow down.  There's a ton of guys that were doing that before you, brother. 
[00:34:00]  He's a scientist.  A ton of guys.  Inventing everything.  Well, sure, he invented everything.  Anyway, Anthony, so the Pat O'Brien sex tapes.  Mm-hmm.  Oh.  Yeah.  Having a lot of fun with that.  And listeners are too.  Yeah, so Eric just alerted the media.  Alerted the media and said, the only place you could hear him unedited is on the Opie and  Anthony program.  And then the listeners have gotten involved big time.  We begged you guys.  There are, as I look, 13 remixes of the Pat O'Brien sex tapes. 
[00:34:30]  Stop it.  Some are good.  Some are really bad.  We're up to 14 now?  Just like everything that the listeners send in.  Oh, one on the back.  Some are good.  Most are bad.  Thanks, Eric.  It was very important to tell them it was actually 14 and not 13.  I appreciate it.  Thank you.  Thank God for those of you keeping track at home.  I want to be very accurate here.  So that's good.  And then we got another one from Danny the intern and another one from Nathaniel the intern.  Oh, a little competition going on.  A little friendly competition between the two.  Are we allowed to call them like interns or did Howard invent that too? 
[00:35:00]  Hoo-hoo.  I invented talking to the intern.  Oh, man.  It's going to be so much fun when he moves over to this side.  Have fun.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  Anyway, also, Anthony, where's Steve?  Someone put together an amazing little flash animation thing with the Pat O'Brien sex stage.  Oh, we were watching that inside just laughing our ass off.  Do we have that up on Found Your Music or opiananthony.com yet?  Some people are really good at that flash.  You want to try to explain it?  Oh, it's Steve.  Oh, yeah, there's Steve. 
[00:35:30]  You got it up yet, Steve, or no?  No, no.  I'm having Dave, the guy that made it, is making a few changes to it.  Basically, what we're going to do, we'll tell everyone, we're all about getting the word out there for the show.  Assault on the media.  I think we got another one that happened in Arkansas.  We'll get to it a little later.  So this guy, he's a huge fan of the show.  He came up with this thing.  We want him to get all the credit in the world, but we also want to stamp it, Found Your Music and opiananthony,  because this is the type of thing that I really believe will be sent all over the country.  It's what they call a viral clip. 
[00:36:00]  It's one of those things that gets emailed and posted on message boards and posted on other websites.  And, you know, you have to let people know where it came from, basically.  Yeah, and we'll get a lot of advertising out of this one.  What's his name?  His name is Dave.  He's from New York.  As soon as he's done with it, we'll get it up on Newgrounds and a couple of other websites.  Tell Dave, you know, anytime he wants to come in and hang out.  Okay, we'll do it.  VIP treatment for Dave.  But basically, explain what it is.  It is, it's like a flash animation, but it's a scorecard.  It's called the Pat O'Brien Sexual Harassment Scorecard.  And it keeps track as those voicemails are running of all the different phrases Pat uses, 
[00:36:30]  all of his responses, all of them.  How many times he says, fuck.  Yep, that's a biggie.  The signals they keep track of.  Yep, the winks and the saying yes.  The call times.  Because he suggests licking various parts of our body.  It is really funny.  Betsy being involved.  Yeah, you hear the Pat O'Brien sex tapes, but then as these phrases are being said, they're  added to a list, and then every time that phrase is being said, the number keeps going 
[00:37:00]  up.  It's really, really well done and funny.  It took a lot of work to put it together.  It deserves a lot of credit.  We watched it like two or three times just laughing like idiots.  Yeah.  So we're going to get that up on Foundry Music and OpieAndAnthony.com.  Oh, blind boxing clips are now up prominently on OpieAndAnthony.com.  Wow, how fast was that?  Well, Eric is a go-getter here.  My goodness.  So we got that.  That's going to happen, Anthony.  You want to play a couple of these sex tape things?  You want to do Nathaniel's and Danny's? 
[00:37:30]  Sure.  All right.  You've heard the sex tapes by now.  We don't have to replay them, do we?  No.  Okay.  Nathaniel came up with this.  I haven't heard this yet.  It was just handed in from Nathaniel.  Oh, we had spoken about that in our meeting.  Uh-oh.  We have a CD player problem, right?  Yeah, sort of.  Okay, here we go.  Hey, it's me.  God, you're so fucking hot. 
[00:38:00]  I don't want to fucking go crazy with you.  I don't want to fucking eat you and fuck you and...  I suck your tits.  Oh, no.  He's right there.  I don't want to fucking lick your pussy and make you...  Oh, God.  I don't want to fucking go crazy with you.  Right.  God, I'm going to have you.  I'm going to be a voice now. 
[00:38:30]  Bye.  Pat O'Brien calling...  Terry Shivo.  Jesus, Nathaniel.  That was yours?  You're learning too well from us, I think.  That was yours, huh?  Yeah.  I mean...  Jesus, that's wrong.  That is so wrong.  What'd I do?  What'd I do?  Hey, what happened?  I thought we were all just having fun.  Yeah.  Did you just throw any clips of her in there, or did you find...  Did you have to look for various...  That sounds like a good moan for this one. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, I actually...  There were 24 groans.  Yeah.  Yeah, I had to go through each one.  No, that one doesn't quite fit here.  I think this one is a little more attack.  This one goes...  This one's...  That sounds better.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was fun.  Good job.  Good job.  Thank you, sir.  Oh, they're coming in like crazy.  We have 14 from the listeners, and we also have something that Danny put together overnight,  so...  Mm-hmm.  Bravo, Nathaniel.  Good job.  Went right for it. 
[00:39:30]  The first one today.  He fits right in, doesn't he?  He sure does.  Save message Sunday, 9.04 p.m.  I'm so attracted to you.  If you want to suck a cock, I want you to dye your hair blonde and put on a flame shirt.  I want to rub your pussy with a loofus sponge.  I just want to spank you and put nipple clamps on you.  I want to lick your pussy.  We'll have a hooker come over, and she'll want us to eat her pussy, but we won't want  to, so she'll give back 50 and then leave the room.  If you agree with this, when the phone rings, pick it up and say hello.  End of message. 
[00:40:00]  To erase this message, press 7.  To erase this message, press 7.  To erase this message...  That's very funny.  Two very different ones, Anthony.  Yeah.  Danny, very obsessed with Jim Norton.  That's the second one he came up with featuring Jim Norton.  Who isn't?  Who's not in studio today.  We're going to have Bob Kelly filling in for him around 8 o'clock or so.  That should be fun.  And Norton will be calling the show as well.  But there you have it. 
[00:40:30]  Made his stomach turn.  Uh-oh.  Let's go to the phones here.  Say hi to...  Ah, shit.  John, what's up?  I thought his name was Ah Shit.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  I've got to tell you.  Yeah.  Nathaniel has finally figured out a way to make my stomach turn with that Terry Chavez thing.  Yeah, there was nothing sexy about that.  Unbelievable.  I mean, I've listened to you guys ever since you've been on XM and off and on before that.  And love you guys.  Love the show.  Love everything about it.  But I almost drove off the road. 
[00:41:00]  Almost got sick to my stomach and threw up.  That is the grossest thing I've ever heard.  But kudos to Nathaniel.  Great job.  All right.  Thank you, John.  All right.  Yeah, I was watching the whole Terry Chavez thing last night before I went to bed.  How do you miss it?  All night long enough.  I know.  It's a horrible thing.  Blah, blah, blah.  My final take on the whole thing, after all said and done and watching everything, I think  they should just leave the goddamn feeding tube in.  Yeah.  Let the parents have their fun with her.  Let them go in and visit and whatever. 
[00:41:30]  I mean, the fact that this husband is the one that has the final say like that is kind  of ridiculous.  And it's crazy.  They should just let her live.  I've changed my mind, too, Anthony.  Yeah.  Because the more and more you listen to the husband, he seems like he has good intentions.  I understand the whole money and the settlement he got and all that.  But the fact is, he's already moved on with his life.  He doesn't love her anymore.  There's nothing.  He's moved on with his life.  He's had kids with another woman.  Yep.  And so, I don't know. 
[00:42:00]  You know.  I mean, her parents obviously are a lot closer to her these days than the husband really is.  Because he really has just moved on.  Yeah.  So, if they want to throw the feeding tube back in, then let them.  If the parents are happy going up there and visiting her and, you know, talking to her  or whatever they do, and she's there, you know, moving her eyes around or whatever, that's  their prerogative.  Let them enjoy whatever time they have with her. 
[00:42:30]  And it's so funny when something like this hits the media, too, they make it sound like  it's the most important thing in the world to them, to us, the viewers.  Yeah.  You know what?  As soon as she dies, all right, just hose down that news story and move on to the next  one.  They don't care.  They'll cover, like, the funeral.  They'll do that.  And then you'll never hear about it again.  Then it's like, who?  What?  What?  Oh, yeah, that story that we may believe we cared so much about.  Huh?  What?  They're such a bunch of phonies.  They're all doing it for the ratings, you know? 
[00:43:00]  Oh, get the husband on the air.  Get the husband's brother on the air.  And don't mistake me.  This isn't some right-to-life thing that I have going, because I'm for scraping every  lowlife's womb until there's nothing left, until it's barren, you know?  I'm all for that.  But I just think they ought to leave her alive, you know?  You're right, Opie.  She will become the Jesse Camp of vegetables.  Yeah, we were talking about Jesse Camp.  All of a sudden, she's everywhere, in your face, until you're annoyed, and then she's 
[00:43:30]  just gone.  It's creepy, because...  Although I think she has a little more brain activity than Jesse ever did.  It's just creepy.  The one thing I learned last night, I'm watching all the coverage.  Yeah.  As we do this morning show right now, there are 35,000 to 40,000 people just like her.  I know they were subscribing to the premium channel, Opie.  Who our listeners are, obviously, with some of these instant feedbacks.  35,000 to 40,000 people just like her. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  In that same state.  Yep.  And where are their stories?  Where are their big stories?  Where are the judges staying up all night in Superior Court hearing their cases?  Yeah.  Nothing.  And this country's ridiculous.  And you've got the Bush brothers.  Don't they have something else to do, really?  Very busy.  Running a state, running the country.  Florida's a very important state.  Jeb said...  Then you've got the president.  He can't do anything.  There's only so much time in a day.  That kind of scares me. 
[00:44:30]  It makes me wonder, what is not being paid attention to because all the efforts are going  towards this instead of something else?  I heard Jeb Bush saying he's very upset with the fact that there are abortions in his state.  But he goes, you know, I'm not above the laws and there's nothing I can do about it.  So he was giving his little abortion stance there.  And, you know, bottom line is, this woman's just going to die.  The parents didn't want it. 
[00:45:00]  This estranged husband did.  And that all seems a little weird to me.  Can I ask you something?  Because you know a little bit about everything, Anthony.  I try.  Well, let's see.  I don't know everything.  Aristotle and fuck Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony.  This question's coming in a lot.  Why can't the husband divorce her?  I don't know.  That's something Professor Anthony doesn't know.  I don't know why he can't divorce her.  I could give you speculation.  First of all, I thought they were divorced. 
[00:45:30]  But I guess they're not.  And perhaps, with the laws, she has to have some kind of say in the matter.  I don't know.  That I don't know, though.  That's one of the little things I don't know about.  Or did he stay married to her so he could get all the money from the lawsuits?  Who knows?  I, you know something?  I could not get enough interest to really look into the case that much.  The second I see those teeth and that slacked jaw of hers on TV, I have to change the channel. 
[00:46:00]  She's too depressing to look at as they do the story.  Sometimes there's certain stories I kind of want to know about, but I can't look at the visual they give me.  But they're giving you that visual to make you feel like that.  Oh!  That undercut jaw, the way her jaw kind of hangs down and her front teeth are just kind of stick.  I can't look at that.  And most of that video is really old.  Yeah, that's something you told me.  I didn't even know that.  Most of the video you're seeing is from 2001.  Yeah.  I haven't seen a current video. 
[00:46:30]  She's worse now.  Well, that's what they're saying.  That's what the husband's trying to say, too.  It's like, look, there's a lot of people out there that are feeling for Terry Schiavo and they have some sympathy  because they're seeing this video that they've been showing in the media.  Uh-huh.  And the reality is she doesn't look like that anymore.  You know something?  And she looks pretty bad there, but he's saying, look, man, it's a lot worse than the video they're showing.  I'd like to know if she's got a life insurance policy.  How about that?  He gets divorced, or perhaps he doesn't.  You know, another thing, her money that she got from the lawsuit. 
[00:47:00]  I don't know if he'd be entitled to it if he divorced her.  Well, if she's dead, then obviously he's the husband.  He gets it.  Anthony, I've been watching the coverage.  Most of that money's gone.  Is it?  Yeah, most of that money's gone.  Most and all.  Paying for her.  Different things.  Paying for her care, and then he went through some of it, too, on his own.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And now that the party's over, he just wants her out of the way.  Let's go to Chad from Out to Lunch.  Chad.  Fellas, what's up?  A fellow DJ. 
[00:47:30]  Oh.  B-double-E-J-A-Y.  I'm just hoping that if I'm ever on a cruise with Anthony, he doesn't roll me off the deck  like he's going to do with another DJ during his vacation.  No.  So you're trying to play the tapes on your show, and then you can't, right?  Oh, the sex tapes?  What happened was not only did I bleep out the F word and all the nasty stuff, but I  was bleeping out suck.  I'm bleeping out anything that's remotely interesting, and they told me that if we played it, that  we were going to get the Van Halen treatment like you guys got back in the day.  Wow, where they pull you off the air and just play music. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, they were going to start simulcasting ESPN radio instead of us.  The one thing I wanted to bring up with you guys, did you notice that, I don't know, maybe  you talked about it already.  She kind of looks like the dude in Seven, the sloth guy.  Oh, my God.  Good job.  Yeah.  I mean, she looks just like that now.  All yellow skin and disgusting.  Awful.  Thanks, Chad.  Now, as you speak, someone's trying to Photoshop that exact thing on whackbag.com.  By the way, guys, I don't know if you want to...  I'm going... 
[00:48:30]  We have an appearance on Saturday at the Guarantean in Baltimore, and I got a big sack  of wow stickers I'm going to bring with me.  This guy's promoting our show, even though he does his own radio show.  I love it.  And just in case, just in case you guys fail, I'm also passing out bandanas.  All right.  All right, Chad.  Yeah, see?  He can't play those clips.  Yeah, you'd think all you'd have to do is bleep out the curses, but even suck.  Yeah.  You can't say suck.  Well, we're going to get into some of the remixes the listeners made after the break.  But first, Seth.  What's up, Seth?  Hey, guys. 
[00:49:00]  How are you?  Pretty good.  We're kind of not really here today because we start our vacation tomorrow, but we'll do the  best we can today.  I'm eating.  Ant's eating.  He's ready to play video poker online.  We've got Bob Kelly coming in.  By the way, we also have Drew Boogie in studio.  He's going to do some mixing live on the show today.  Morning, people.  So what's up, Seth?  Well, you know, you guys were just saying you wondered why Michael Schiavo didn't divorce  Terry.  Yeah.  And, you know, he actually became a nurse right after she had all the problems and she slipped 
[00:49:30]  into her vegetative state to help treat her.  And he actually chose not to divorce her.  Yeah.  And I guess he's been fighting this long battle to get her the right to die for years and years.  And he's doing it in her best interest, not, I guess, in his own.  But who knows?  He might have some sick side like everybody else.  Well, that's the official story.  Yeah, that's the official story.  That's why they're ruling for him every time.  They say that he knew her wishes and this was her wish. 
[00:50:00]  Hey, you guys, kick ass.  Take care, man.  Have a good vacation.  Oh, thanks.  Let's go to Dewey in Jersey.  Dewey, what's up?  Not much.  If he divorces her, he loses his guardianship.  So they can just put the two back in if they wanted to.  Oh, there you go.  Very good point.  They had his lawyer on Fox News.  And Fox News has been just brutal.  Every time they come back from a commercial break, they have her pictures, old pictures  of her, like, before the vegetated state, playing the music with the piano, and they 
[00:50:30]  go into her, picture of her in her bed going right into the news.  It's incredibly horrible.  Well, there's Fox News alert.  Shung.  She's still alive.  She's still alive.  Oh.  Are you guys going to bring back the old Apache sound bite you guys had?  Which one?  The Apache.  Apache helicopter when caller went wrong.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Play them getting blown up by an Apache.  That's a good idea.  We're going to bring this whole show to the next level when we get back from break.  I invented that.  By the way, next week and the week after, we're in worst of mode or whatever, but there's 
[00:51:00]  a ton of new material.  Interviews that we did, us introing the bits.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  Eric worked around the clock for days on end to get it all together.  Righty right.  It's a lot different than the old days when we would just slap a few bits together and  go on vacation.  All right.  Why don't we take our first break?  All right.  I want to play this before we go to Joe Boogie, though.  How am I going to do this?  What is that?  I want to play Nathaniel's thing again. 
[00:51:30]  That's really bad.  You can't use the second CD player then?  No.  I need a bigger board here.  Then it's impossible.  Then we'd have to play it.  It wouldn't be a smooth, slick radio CJ transition.  We'll play it after break and then play some new ones that the listeners came up with.  All right?  And also, we've got to do the assault on the media thing.  So you need me to do this?  Yeah.  Put that number one in there.  Put one in here.  Put one in here.  But.  Hold on.  Then I do this.  But.  I do that. 
[00:52:00]  I hit this and we go to break?  Yeah.  Nice.  We'll continue in just a bit.  Here comes the.  Ready and now.  Here comes the.  Here comes the.  Ready and now.  Now you like me now.  Warning.  Warning.  Warning.  Warning.  I have come here to kick, kick, kick ass.  Kick, kick ass.  Kick ass.  Kick ass.  Kick ass. 
[00:52:30]  Kick ass.  I have come here to kick, kick, kick ass.  Kick ass.  Like sand through the hourglass.  So is the O&A virus.  How can I honestly say?  Anybody rips me off.  When I hear the same exact bits done, that's how I say it. 
[00:53:00]  I mean, what about wow?  That's totally their idea.  Oh, there you go.  Okay.  There's something new.  Well, and then.  There's something new.  You know what?  I used to do that in Washington, D.C.  Tell them, Fred.  I used to have people tie bandanas around their cars so that women would take their clothes  off in the cars.  Dude, get with it.  All right.  Well, I mean.  Give me an original idea.  Come on.  I mean.  I know.  I know.  I used to have my listeners tie a bandana around their car.  I mean, I've done it all.  What about going off on their car?  I totally know that's you.  All right.  Okay. 
[00:53:30]  Whatever.  I got to go.  Please.  I don't really want to get into a discussion like this.  So delusional.  That is really funny.  Someone found the clip.  Yeah, that's something we couldn't play on the old show because of the gag order that  he placed on us.  How do you tie a bandana around your car?  That's a great one.  That's a big bandana.  What's the matter?  My car has cancer.  People throwing Frisbees to their cars.  Jump and grab it.  Just showing your age, man.  You can't even tie bandanas to antennas anymore. 
[00:54:00]  It's all hippied out.  You honk the horn.  Beep, beep.  Dude.  He's so delusional.  Oh, man.  Just admit it.  Wow is such an original idea.  I invented everything.  I've done it all.  He even said, I've done it all.  Wow.  Even the stuff that's going to be invented.  I did already.  There's no real idea.  I went into a time machine and I already did it.  Everyone just killed themselves.  I've done it all. 
[00:54:30]  I was the first one to do anything.  Marconi ripped me off, Robin.  Remember, what was that thing called?  Dot, dot, dash, dash, dot Morse code.  It was Howard code earlier.  The guy ripped me off.  I invented SOS.  Hoo, hoo, hoo, Robin.  What a complete jackass.  He's the guy.  Wow.  Wow.  He invented wow.  And it had nothing to do with whip him out Wednesday.  Wow.  It was tying a bandana around your car.  Thank you, Howard. 
[00:55:00]  And what were we supposed to do if you saw him?  I don't know.  He didn't really explain it very well.  Of course he's not going to explain.  If someone had a bandana tied around their car somehow, girls would get naked in the car?  It wasn't even flat.  Girls would get naked.  They're driving, taking their clothes off, crashing into a button, Mr. Robin.  But I invented traffic accidents.  A bandana around an antenna that reminds me of something else I've heard.  It's called the fucking flag.  That's not exactly somebody's fucking invention. 
[00:55:30]  I invented that, Robin.  They say Betsy Ross did that.  I sewed the stars on.  Hoo, hoo, hoo, it was all me.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I honestly don't care.  I don't care.  I invented that.  The bandana was me.  For me and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  Me and Anthony, XM202.  It's time to come too far.  It's time to come too far.  It's time to come too far.  I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't. 
[00:56:00]  It's time to come too far.  Yes.  It's time to come too far.  Yes.  It's time to come too far.  I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't.  Yes.  Come on.  Come on.  Hey, we're back with the Opie and Anthony program. 
[00:56:30]  Doing something a little different today.  We got Drew Boogie in the studio.  Man, mixing live for us.  I don't know if this is an original line from Fast Freddy, Jamaica Station, but very funny.  Because the audio you're playing of Terry Schiavo, is that from her Unplugged CD?  Oh, my God. 
[00:57:00]  It's Terry Schiavo Unplugged.  Oh, is that awful?  Fast Freddy, very good.  Well, let's be honest with each other.  They're showing the video of Terry Schiavo on TV, and then you, Drudge, I think, had the audio of her.  Yep.  It's all out there.  It just gets you to react, you know?  Of course.  And then we take it, and we do something else with it, and it also makes you react.  Yeah.  React with sickness.  A lot of people are requesting what Nathaniel did overnight. 
[00:57:30]  So, once again, it's the Pat O'Brien sex tapes mixed in with the Terry Schiavo audio.  Oh, my God.  Oh, what?  Look, it's Terry Schiavo.  They're showing her.  Oh, wow.  Is she curled up?  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  I haven't seen that video yet.  She's all stiff.  All right, now.  She's like Ben at the meeting.  Look, it changes by the moment.  Now you've got to let her just go.  Did you see that?  So what? 
[00:58:00]  And that looks like more recent video, by the way.  She's still got blood flowing through her.  Oh, come on.  She's still, like, you know, kind of...  Her parents can pet her and stuff.  Wow.  No, that was very, very creepy.  That was pretty creepy looking.  Anyway, before we move on, once again, it's Nathaniel, the intern.  Hey, it's me.  God, you're so fucking hot.  You know what I'm fucking?  I'm crazy, isn't it?  I'm going to fucking eat you and fuck you and suck your tits. 
[00:58:30]  If you agree with this, say yes.  But yes, be in the bed.  Say I told that to your answer, her.  God, I want to fucking lick your pussy and make you come so much.  I want to fucking go crazy with you.  Go out the bathroom and let me have boys now.  Bye.  Oh, that's... 
[00:59:00]  That is wrong on so many levels, Nathaniel.  The filth I feel.  I feel very sorry for you when XM calls us and tells us that you have to go.  Yeah.  Because you were so great for the radio show.  Guys, do you really need someone like that involved with the show?  I had nothing to do with that.  He's giving me the finger.  He's like, I learned it from you, okay? 
[00:59:30]  Okay.  Nathaniel said I did it.  I can't get fired.  Yeah.  We can all get fired.  We've learned that lesson.  Well, I guess we did learn that lesson.  Hey, Brent, the trucker, what's up?  No, hold on.  I've got to do this.  Oh, you've got to do that.  Yeah, Drew Boogie has messed me up today.  It's okay.  Sorry.  We had to reconfigure the whole board so Drew Boogie could remix live.  What?  What, Brent?  I've got a cousin.  This is no joke.  Okay.  I've got a cousin that's married to a whack job. 
[01:00:00]  He cannot divorce her because she's not in a mental state.  If you're in a medical condition, it's kind of hard for them to serve papers if you're not with the program, so it's illegal.  That's a real deal.  I've got a cousin that's like that.  Is she in a good enough mental state to maybe go fishing off Modesto?  You've got to get rid of her somehow.  All right.  Thank you.  In the studio, we have Tyson Walters, the center for the Dallas Cowboys, a good friend of mine. 
[01:00:30]  We're going to go see the Black Crows tonight.  It's going to be a party.  He's in town for the weekend.  And outside, we've got Bob Kelly.  Did he prepare material?  Oh, my goodness.  He's writing something down.  Hey, Bob.  Come on in.  You get the star treatment today.  He's going to hate me.  Watch this.  Why are you waiting out there?  I'm going to suck a dick.  We always have him wait out there for about an hour before he gets to come in here.  An hour and 45 minutes, and then you bring me in and go, what the fuck are you doing here?  Well, we always want to bring him in, but when Jimmy's here, he keeps going like, no, don't bring him in yet. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, is that it?  It's all Jimmy's fault.  That little frigging worm.  No, you get the star treatment today because you're filling in for the big guy.  I do.  I can actually sit down.  Yeah, if Norton was there, we'd get to you eventually, but today you get the star treatment.  Sit down.  Sure.  You got your Starbucks?  Anything else you need today?  No, I'm good, actually.  I'm good.  You want to eat granola?  Can I eat some of your granola?  If you like, sure.  I've got milk in the fridge.  Everything.  Whatever you want, bro.  You know what?  Opie, you're making me fucking very nervous, you son of a bitch. 
[01:01:30]  There's something going to go on.  No, nothing bad.  How you doing, man?  How you doing, man?  You really get the star treatment today.  All right, man.  How you guys doing?  That's a very important scene on the Opie and Anthony program, and you're sitting in it today,  so whatever you need, Bob.  You're actually going to let me get a plug out without cutting the whole radio show off?  You get plugs.  I will not kick your dog.  Everything is good.  All right, man.  It's good to see you, man.  You look good.  I like that sweater.  Ant, how you doing, buddy?  Very good.  It's good to see you, man.  Just enjoy this, because the next time you're here and Norton's here, it's going to be back 
[01:02:00]  to how it usually is.  It's going to be sitting in that fucking chair like a dentist office.  Just to introduce you to all the players, that's Drew Boogie.  What's up, Drew Boogie?  How you doing, Ron?  He's mixing live on the show.  Oh, no shit, really?  Yes.  Nice to meet you, man.  And Tyson Walters, who plays for the Dallas Cowboys.  Hey, man.  How you doing?  Don't put that S on the back of his name.  No S.  I'm going to kick your ass.  Tyson Walter.  No, he doesn't care.  It's his fans that care.  Hey, dude, you're a real good friend of his.  You don't even know his last name is Walter, not Walter.  Psycho.  Maybe there were two of them in here.  It's possible. 
[01:02:30]  And it's Tyson Walters.  There's two of them.  Exactly.  Sure.  Who's the big guy on the couch?  He's my bodyguard, and he's going to fight Poe in a cage match later.  Really?  Yep.  Now, what does he do for a living, man?  He stamps steel.  Do you really?  Almost other things.  Oh, yeah?  He's more of the managerial level, though.  He's a monster.  He's even bigger than you.  He weighs more than I do, yes.  Yeah, but you know what?  He's kind of cute.  He has dimples.  He does.  That's what his grandmother calls him.  Dimples.  You call them dimples?  Dimples.  He has cute little dimples.  Before you fight him, you want to just put your finger in one and twist it. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  Imagine 6'3", about 345.  Jesus.  He's like every bouncer that would be brought up on charges for stomping someone's head apart  in a parking lot somewhere.  That's pretty much what the look he's going for there.  That's good.  He's a party, though.  Yeah?  I hope he'll find out tonight.  Oh, you guys all hangin'.  What the hell does that mean?  I'm a gang.  Settle down.  Settle down.  You're getting excited.  Settle down.  Hold on.  What the hell's going to happen?  And false hope all in the studio.  I'm going to black out like Dee Dee and all of a sudden. 
[01:03:30]  There's going to be all sorts of crap happening.  You have no choice with that big guy, though.  I'd have to suck his cock in the parking lot.  Look how big he is.  Again.  Again.  Please don't hurt me, sir.  All right.  Why do you need a bodyguard?  It's just his friend.  He's just showing off.  God, that thing's still not healed?  No, it's healed.  I have a smaller thing now, and I can take it off and sleep without it.  Now you can see my cool scars.  This guy hurt his wrist last game of the season against the Giants. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  And he's still, like, recuperated.  Yeah.  You playing for the Cowboys?  Yeah.  Wow.  That's the word.  Yeah.  That's the word.  That's the word.  Word on the street.  I'm a Patriots fan.  I'm sorry.  It happens.  You guys hate the Patriots?  Is everybody pissed off at them because they're winning every year?  I don't hate anybody.  You don't hate?  Jesus Christ.  They're all potential employers, man.  I don't hate anybody.  You're a smart guy.  Yeah.  He's at that stage in his contract that the Pats could easily be picking him up.  You never know after the season.  God willing.  This is the last year on your deal, right? 
[01:04:30]  Actually, I'm going to sign probably one year tender and stay with Cowboys for one more  year.  Yeah.  Then go for the gold, hopefully.  Go for the gold.  That's what it's all about, man.  Go for the ring.  How's Parcellsian ass?  No, Parcells.  Parcells is cool, man.  Is he cool?  As I double take and choke.  Yeah, Parcells.  Oh, shit.  That's a freaking trick question.  I almost got you, too, didn't I?  You sonny bitch.  He's pretty cool to me so far.  He hasn't fired me yet, so I can't badmouth him.  There you go.  That's positive.  He's a very intimidating guy because when Norton was playing one of the clubs in Dallas, 
[01:05:00]  I went down there, and then I ended up playing golf with Tyson, and we're on the driving  range hitting balls, and all of a sudden he goes, hey, boss is here.  I'm like, and I turn, and there's Parcells and his golf cart coming to the driving range.  He's an intimidating mother.  And he had a nice smile on his face because it wasn't the season.  He's very relaxed, but you could tell that guy is just an ass.  Yeah.  You could just tell.  When he gets angry, you know about it.  Oh, everyone does.  Yeah.  Yeah, not just you. 
[01:05:30]  The whole country finds out about him.  Do you have any friends that are small?  Or do you just laugh at little people?  Hello.  Why?  We're good friends.  I'm half his size.  Is that it?  Do you and your big friends laugh at Opie and stuff?  Like, God, how could someone be so little?  We treat them like pets.  Oh, they're like pets, right?  Yeah.  Come here, you.  Come on, Opie.  Come on.  Tussle the hair.  I try to act even extra tougher around it.  Oh, stop.  It just looks stupid. 
[01:06:00]  I'll admit it.  It just looks dumb.  Exactly.  Why even bother?  We'll be in bars and stuff like, yeah, let's take on those guys over there.  Do you walk up to the club and like, oh, do you just hang up behind these guys?  It's awful.  Like, oh, this is embarrassing.  I wear, like, extra leather, uh, leathers.  Hello.  I wear extra layers and a big bubble coat just trying to puff myself up it.  Ain't gonna work.  And then I'm walking on my tippy toes to give me an extra inch or two.  It's just awful. 
[01:06:30]  He does the whole hold me back gag.  Come on.  Come on, man.  Yeah, I can see him picking fights with every big guy around.  Yeah, motherfucker, come on.  Come on, hit me.  Hit me.  Yeah, but you're like, you're like, you're not like, you know, you're naturally big.  You're not like, you know, bodybuilder, shredded.  I mean, you're like, like an old superhero.  That's a nice way to say fat, thank you.  But you're like an old superhero, like Superman, like the first Superman.  Like a 50-year-old superhero, like the Incredibles.  I'm not trying to be a dick, but I mean.  Like the original Superman from the TV show. 
[01:07:00]  You remember he was like barrel-chested?  I realize I have the upper body of Terry Schiavo now because I can't work out, but.  Freaking A, man.  I'm tearing the hell off.  Jesus.  Can you tell your bodyguard to stop staring at me like he's going to face fuck me?  Well, that's not the bad part.  When he's licking his lips, that makes it difficult for you.  No, that turns me out.  Freaking like a hotel sink.  You have the.  You do have the look like you were supposed to play football back in the 70s.  Because you got the side.  That's what I'm saying.  I know what you're saying.  Yeah, I know what you're saying.  Wow.  Before they had, you know, before they really got shredded.  Back in the day, they were doing roids back in the 70s, man. 
[01:07:30]  Really?  Oh, and they're not doing it now.  Yeah, I know.  Exactly.  Wink, wink.  Stop.  I swear to God.  Swear to God.  It is not.  There are always guys that are going to try and get around and stuff like that.  But football is not an issue for the simple reason that the first time you get nailed,  you lose a quarter of your salary right off the top.  It's not like baseball where you're losing five grand out of, you know, $20 million.  Right.  Football is the real deal.  And they're testing.  How often do they test?  We test randomly.  During the season, it starts beginning of March and tests all the way through the end 
[01:08:00]  of the season.  And you get tested randomly.  So it ends up being five or six times a year, probably, is the average.  And this is what a lot of people have been asking over the last few weeks.  You know, why isn't there any attention on steroids in football?  But they're very strict, you're saying.  They're extremely strict.  I mean, they come after you hard and fast.  They do not mess around with performance-enhancing drugs.  If we take Sudafed, because there's the, I don't know what the hell the drug is.  Ephedrine.  Ephedrine.  Ephedrine? 
[01:08:30]  Ephedrine.  Whatever.  Not Ephedrine.  Ephedrine is another, Ephedrine.  That's what it is.  Whatever it is, though.  No, that's what it is.  Okay, damn.  Sorry.  Doogie Howser.  Freaking A.  Jesus.  But, no, but whatever it is.  Just take it, Bob.  There's nothing you can do.  You insane?  I know.  Your words are cute and all, but in the end, it's not about how good you are on a mic.  Nathaniel's going to have a little tape of me.  Bob, we're removing his feeding tube today.  Say Ephedrine, bitch. 
[01:09:00]  Say Ephedrine.  Say it one more time.  Say it one more time, funny man.  There you go.  Sudafed, yes.  Sudafed, those cold drugs.  We have to tell them that we're taking it and notify the trainers and the medical staff of the team.  Just because if you take more than the recommended dosage, it'll flag a false positive.  And, you know, once you test positive, there's no going back on it.  The only hope he has, because we do two samples.  And so they test the first one, and then if you appeal, they'll test the second sample that they have from the same batch. 
[01:09:30]  That's your only hope of getting off.  You know anybody that's lost a quarter of their salary?  Not on the Cowboys we haven't had anybody recently.  Well, was it last year or two years ago, the end for Carolina, what's his name, got nailed.  And he said it was cold medicine.  So, I mean, it can legitimately happen.  So when you hear about it, it possibly being cold medicine is legit.  So those guys are just big guys.  They're a lot of big dudes, man.  Me and Norton did a show for the Cleveland Browns, which is, you know, stupid. 
[01:10:00]  I don't know why they picked us.  We did the whole team, the rookie team.  But you look out, and there's like two white guys.  There were that many?  I swear to God, it was in the dark.  Oh, jeez.  No.  You just had Scooby-Doo eyes looking back at you.  Blink, blink.  But these guys were so big, but you guys don't know your own strength, because I was  messing around, and I pushed him, just kidding around. 
[01:10:30]  And he pushed me back, and I fell on the floor, and then rolled like three times.  And nobody even asked if I was hurt.  They just all laughed at me.  Of course they did.  You're a joke.  Look, we are just, us people that are muscularly challenged, we love to say, oh, that guy's  on the roid, because we hate thinking that nature has shortchanged us so badly that it's  just some kind of a natural phenomenon, and this guy's just perhaps, it's in his DNA, and 
[01:11:00]  he's taken care of himself and worked out to get himself that big.  So we're always like, ah, roid head.  Yeah, it's the roid.  No.  Well, some people are lucky, and other people have big cocks.  Oh, Jesus, I don't fit into either one of those, you ass.  It all balances out, though.  I mean, you look at the giant football players or whatever, and realize that that's all that  they have.  I mean, we're ugly and stupid on top of that.  I mean, we've got nothing else going besides being big.  The interesting thing. 
[01:11:30]  The interesting thing.  Professional football.  That's the money.  Right?  Yeah, it's the money.  It's not because of our personality or looks.  I've learned a lot about the NFL by hanging out with Tyson Walter.  And it's really interesting how strict the league is.  You guys get, he was telling me one day, I think on the golf course, all the things you  could get fined for.  Yep.  It's unbelievable.  Oh, yeah.  Some of the things you could get fined for real fast.  Late to a meeting can be five to ten grand.  Cell phone goes off in a meeting, five grand.  Get the fuck out of your cell phone ring.  They should have that in goddamn movie theaters. 
[01:12:00]  Dude, they are so strict.  It's, it's, go ahead.  Some of the stuff like game day and all that.  Game day, if you're, we have to get to the stadium two hours before the game.  If you're late to that, that's close to a game check.  So that just depends on your salary.  So it's 1 17th of your salary.  What else is there?  Even if you have a good excuse, like there was an accident, something.  There's no such thing.  They say, make sure you get there early enough.  And if there's an accident, if there's traffic, even like on Monday night games when there's  extra traffic, you get caught in rush hour because where the stadium is, it's right, 
[01:12:30]  you know, kind of in downtown.  You know, you better leave early.  You better leave at three o'clock for nine o'clock game, eight o'clock game.  You guys are like, it's, it's almost like being institutionalized.  Pretty much.  I mean, cause you guys have been since Pop Warner and then high school and then college and  now the pros, it's, it's like being in jail.  And when you guys are done with your career, it's like, you guys are like, what the fuck  do I do?  It's, it's a very structured environment.  Some teams are more than others.  I think right now we, we have a very structured environment.  Yeah, but some of the stuff with the uniform too, I found. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  Your socks are, well, go ahead.  I'm sorry.  If your towel's too long, like on the center, so if the weather's cold or if it's raining,  if your towel's too long over, I think it's like five inches or something like that,  then you get fined by the league for that.  If your socks, if your jersey's untucked, if, if you have a taper or a,  hemmed and stuff, tucked in, you can get fined for that.  I mean, just everything is ridiculous.  If you have any kind of message on like your tape or something like that, they can come  after you and try and fine you for that.  Oh, you tape up and then you write something in marker like, hi mom or something. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah, they can come after you for that.  Isn't that just the mess with all like the gay guys in the league?  That's not really for you guys.  Well, that's, no, that's when you just wink at them.  I mean, and then on top of that, you have to deal with like, everyone's got like a  shoe deal of some sort of, it's not, nothing major, but you get free shoes and some, you  know, a couple grand of free gear or something like that.  So if you like spat your shoes, tape over them, then, you know, Nike sends you letters  saying that they're going to terminate your contract because, and it's like, oh, so we  don't give a damn about my fucking ankles if I blow out ankles.  Yeah, they don't care.  Just show the shoe, asshole. 
[01:14:00]  As long as the swoosh is on there, you're good to go.  What is it about the hair though?  No one seems to mind about, you know, guys that look like Predator wearing helmets with  two words, Randy Moss.  Well, that's, uh, that's actually in the CBA, the collective bargaining agreement that  they cannot regulate, uh, length or style of hair.  Really?  Yeah.  And I think facial hair is also in there.  Wow.  Cause yeah, that, that's really, you know, taken off where.  Yeah.  The holdout in 87, that's what it was all about.  It was about length of hair.  Yeah.  Length of hair. 
[01:14:30]  Did you, did you, did you put a vote in on that?  Um, I was nine.  Oh, all right.  You asked.  This guy's not only is he a big guy, he's kind of funny too.  You asked.  I really don't like that.  Wow.  That's very regulated, very strict.  And then, uh, baseball is like Delta house.  Oh, they really don't care.  Oh, the worst.  It's just, yeah, no regulations.  They, the worst is when you have baseball players that come in and play football and  they tell you all the stories of how baseball is and how it's laid back and their spring  trainings, just like they're all in condos and, you know, they've rented Mercedes for 
[01:15:00]  the, you know, six weeks that they're down in Florida and how they have, uh, kegerators  in their, uh, weight rooms and stuff like that.  And we're just like, are you kidding me?  It's absolutely amazing.  I saw, I saw that myself because, uh, I have a sister who lives in Orlando, spring training,  capital of the world, basically.  And, uh, there was a time I was sort of friends with Curt Schilling way back in the day.  Oh.  And I happened to be down in Florida and he came into the same strip club as me.  Would you kick him in the ankle? 
[01:15:30]  And I saw how these guys were just living like rock stars during spring training.  I mean, they were in the strip clubs every night.  There was a whole table.  I think he was playing, I don't remember anymore.  Maybe the Astros back then.  And, uh, yeah, there was a whole table of them just getting lap dances.  They were all dating the girls.  Oh, yeah.  It was just like, I'm like, don't you guys have to worry about, you know, you know, training  tomorrow?  Ah, we'll get to it.  It doesn't matter.  I mean, those guys, they don't have to be, their games, in spring training, they're in  the afternoon more.  But, you know, once again, the regular season, their games aren't usually until the evening  and stuff like that.  Yeah.  Even the minor leagues.  And so they'll literally go out until four or five o'clock in the morning and then sleep 
[01:16:00]  till noon.  So you still get seven, eight hours of sleep.  And they head to the ballpark and, you know, party on.  Yeah, they're awful.  I had Brian Daubach came to a show one night.  He had a game the next day.  I mean, an afternoon game.  Just shit-faced.  Out of his mind.  They actually kicked him out of the showroom, him and his chick.  Wow.  And I was just looking at him, like, dude, I was like so excited to meet him.  But I'm like, dude, you have a game tomorrow.  He's like, ah, fuck it.  Fuck it.  I don't give a shit.  They're not really baseball players. 
[01:16:30]  How hard are they really working?  You guys must laugh at baseball players.  Yeah.  I'm jealous.  Come on.  Can I really do it?  Standing out there with your glove on, waiting for a ball to come to you.  Or sitting on the bench, waiting to get up and hit one.  Come on.  Exactly.  Chewing some seeds, getting guaranteed money.  Never getting hurt.  You guys need a week off just to recuperate.  Yeah.  So, well, they're worse things in life.  I remember a quick story.  When I was growing up, I was a caddy at the Huntington Crescent Club.  No caddy.  We did that caddy tournament.  This was the years that... 
[01:17:00]  Come here, Opie.  You tell Ty Wib I'm gunning for him.  That's the only other job I've ever had.  Caddy.  I love that he was a caddy.  Caddy and this.  That's all I've ever done in my life.  I worked at a video store for like two weeks because, you know, before porn was readily  available, all my friends would come in and we'd watch porn while I'm trying to rent tapes.  I'm aphrodite.  And then the moms would come in with the kids and see the porn on the screen.  I got fired.  And that's it.  That's all I've done in my life. 
[01:17:30]  But back in the day, it was when the Islanders were winning all the Stanley Cups.  And I swear to you, man, on off days, the guys would play golf, the Islanders, and I  think it was the series with the LA Kings.  So this goes way back.  And they were getting hammered on their days off and playing with each other.  And you're watching the games on TV like, oh, look, these guys fucking hate each other  and they're out for blood.  And on the course, they're just getting completely hammered.  How would you like to roll my roll?  Billy Smith was just, you know, just slamming them back. 
[01:18:00]  And I'm thinking to myself, but you've got a game tomorrow, you know?  I mean, you've got to take the days off when you get a chance.  You have to relieve some stress.  Unwind a bit.  Yeah, there are basically, you know, four nights where guys know that they can kind  of go out and do a little bit of damage.  But it also depends on the coaching staff.  Our head man has definitely made it known that he does not want any partiers.  And there have been some serious disciplinary actions.  Your quarterback.  Your quarterback was last. 
[01:18:30]  Test of energy?  No, Quincy.  Quincy.  Oh, that was in training camp.  Well, that was different.  I don't know what the official party line is, so I can't speak.  Ah, come on.  You are smart, man.  He knows.  He's very diplomatic.  No, the whole thing with that is that you wake up and you go in the training room, because  we're in training camp.  We're totally sequestered from the rest of the world.  We don't see anybody.  We don't hear anything.  And you go in the training room, and then the next thing you know, you're out on the  field and there's no Quincy, and you're like, where the hell's Quincy?  Oh, Jesus.  And then it's like, oh, yeah, Parcell's fucking cutting this morning.  You're like, what?  And then you don't know what the story is, and then you have to try to talk to the media 
[01:19:00]  after practice to find out what he's told them, and it's just, it's a...  Walking on eggshells.  It's a little convoluted way of getting your information, but sometimes.  Yeah, really.  But in that situation, he actually took us after practice, and he brought us all up  and said, this is what I had to do.  I didn't want to, you know, kind of do it, and, you know, it's one of those things where  it seems, I guess, he had another problem at the end of the season with the Jets, and  he just wished the best for the guy.  I mean, that's just not stuff you fool around with. 
[01:19:30]  Wow.  Wow.  Do you guys, like, when we did the Cleveland Browns show, after the show, all the white  dudes came up to me.  LL Cool J was there, and all the black guys, which is, you know, 99% of the team went over  to LL Cool J, and all the white guys came over to me and Norton.  You're going to ask why?  No, I'm not going to ask why.  I know why.  Okay.  You don't have to be in football to figure that one out.  My God, man.  But they took us into this back place where the white dudes hung out.  It was like the foot, all the shoe room, and they had beers in there, and we're all hanging  out with, like, the kicker. 
[01:20:00]  It's like a country club.  The kicker.  Yeah, the kicker.  That's smaller than you, right?  Yeah, the kicker.  I was busting his ball.  Screw him, that little frigging 165 douche.  But, uh.  He'll be out of us.  And, oh.  Oh, no.  Kid, because I love.  Yeah, but is there, you guys.  Do you guys, like, have your own little joints?  There's segregation or something you're talking about in the NFL?  Yeah, yeah.  Black-white segregation.  Yeah, like, that's what blew me away.  It's like, they had their own little spot.  Wow, really?  The white guys didn't hang out with the black guys on the team?  Well, I thought, you know, it's, you know, 2002, maybe, you know. 
[01:20:30]  You would think maybe they're partying together or something?  Did you see Friday Night Lights?  They were all hanging out together and having fun?  Oh, yeah, you think that's what it's like, I guess.  Yeah, I thought, yeah.  Maybe, you know, things are different now.  I'm sure it changes from team to team.  I've only been with the Cowboys, so I can't speak for other teams, really.  But we're real good at hanging out together.  Everyone's pretty young overall, besides the couple guys that have come in lately that are, you know, 50 years old or so.  But, no, we all hang out a bunch.  We have a bunch of dinners together.  We do a ton of off-the-field stuff together. 
[01:21:00]  The closest thing we have to that is our locker room is basically square,  and then we've got about eight couches that form a square within the locker room.  And it seems all the white guys will sit on the couches and stuff.  And then Keyshawn Johnson, who's, you know, like, speaking his opinion, he's a funny guy,  will make his reference to Klan meetings and things like that, joking.  I mean, it's purely in jest, but...  Does he come over and shut off your country music off the boombox  and then put on his rap music and you guys all sing together and they teach you how to dance?  We point to each other and the next guy comes in with the mic and... 
[01:21:30]  Yeah, you take your cowboy hat and put it on Keyshawn.  Yeah.  Aw.  With a feather boa.  Everyone's all together.  All right.  We're saying we are family.  Well, Tyson Walter is hanging out with us today.  Also, Bob Kelly and Drew Boogie.  Tyson is hot.  I wanted to fuck him when he was with OSU.  Ask him how big his hog is.  I can deep throat nine inches.  You've got a fan in Toledo, Ohio, Tyson.  What's his name?  Pat O'Brien. 
[01:22:00]  I want to fuck you.  I want to suck your toots.  I want to...  The girl's name is Hannah.  Hannah, huh?  With an email address and everything.  Wow.  Hannah, send your picture directly.  We need to...  Here you go, pal.  We need to discuss this on the show.  There you go.  How often do you get that?  A lot, right?  Are you married?  There's got to be a lot of football groupies.  Do I look stupid?  I really want to say shit back to you, but you've got friggin' hands the size of catcher's  mitts.  And then you have a bigger guy behind that, which I don't think you need. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, if there was a miracle and you were able to do some damage to him, a miracle happened,  then you've got to deal with him.  And then after him, I've got to deal with Master Poe.  This is just a lose-lose situation.  Wow.  Sit there and...  I'm just wondering if you had a girl.  I mean, does it matter if she wanted to suck you a mule?  You know?  I mean, are you that picky?  I'm single right now.  Oh, I'm picky as hell, man.  Really?  Yeah, when there's a potential...  For a blowjob?  This is...  You know, this is how Kobe got started. 
[01:23:00]  It's, you know, like doing drugs, man.  Dateway, man.  Next thing you know, you're raping chicks and getting accused of stuff.  It's just a bad road to hoe.  All right.  Does it really go from getting a random blowjob to raping a chick?  I know.  Yes, it does.  That's a big step.  You'd be surprised.  All right.  Well, why don't we move on.  Tyson's here.  A bunch of things happen, Anthony.  You know the sexual harassment scorecard thing we were talking about earlier?  The Pat O'Brien sex tapes that we thought was really, really funny?  That's now online, so you can check it out for yourself on foundrymusic.com and opianthony.com, okay? 
[01:23:30]  Speaking of which, you want to play a couple of these remixes from the listeners as we go to break?  Mm-hmm.  We could start with some of the mediocre ones and get better and better.  Sure.  All right.  Give me a listen.  Bob, have you heard the sex tapes yet?  The Pat O'Brien sex tapes?  Yeah.  Yeah, it was pretty amazing, isn't it?  I was listening to it with my girlfriend, and she was like, who's that?  Who is that friggin' pig?  What a creep.  I just love how unoriginal he is, because I know how hard, like, phone sex is, but he just kept saying the same thing. 
[01:24:00]  It's so hard.  It's so hot.  But he's not even really having phone sex yet.  This is just what he wants to do.  But you could tell he's trying so hard to think of something new, because he was like, I want to lick your pussy.  I want to suck your tits.  And then, like, you run out.  Yeah, it's fine.  It's like pussy tits.  And then he almost felt good about, like, oh, I want to lick your ass.  Yeah, ass.  Ass.  I remembered another thing.  But then after that, it's just like, and I want to, you're so fucking hot.  I can't think of anything.  It is hard, though.  It's hard to be original when you're talking. 
[01:24:30]  Was she in the same room?  No.  What was that, you know, I want you to say yes or lick him.  Yeah, I think they were.  They're in the same workplace.  They have to be, yeah.  Like, he works with her.  It's got to be an assistant or something.  You know, if you're into this, say yes.  Just walk up to me and say yes.  So he's picturing her walking up and just going, yes.  And he's freaking out.  Can you imagine the feeling he would get at that point?  Oh, butterflies if she would just walk up and went, yes.  Oh, God.  I'm shooting a load in my pants.  Oh, he just couldn't take it.  Fuck the insider. 
[01:25:00]  I got a cold.  I got to go home right now.  I got to go.  I'm working on a story.  I got to leave.  She banged him, though.  They were together already.  Do you think?  Or not?  I don't know.  I had two girls.  My girl and her girlfriend were listening to it, and they immediately said they were fucking around.  She already did something.  Yeah, you can't.  But hold on a minute.  He's already married with a kid, not divorced.  Then he's got this other girl, Betsy, that we thought was his wife.  Apparently all started getting into this deeper.  So there's Betsy, and now there's this third girl.  I think he was talking to her one time.  What a great guy.  I think he's talking, having a little chat, and they were being flirtatious, and he was 
[01:25:30]  like, you know, maybe me, you, and Betsy get together one of these things, and she probably  said something like, hey, you know, you never know.  Maybe give a sexy little look and walked away.  Like, and he just, you know, doing coke and drinking, gets this bug up his ass to call her up and  just, you know, ah, you're so hot, I want to fuck the shit out of you, and lick your  ass, and did I mention your ass, and your tits, and it just got so worked up.  Your ass again.  Your ass.  And your tits again. 
[01:26:00]  Betsy.  Betsy's ass.  Yeah, Betsy.  I want to beat off on, I want to beat off on your face, we'll get whores, coke, drugs.  You ever have a girl tell you in bed that you want to talk dirty to her?  Yeah.  And you're just like, what are you, you kind of sound like Pat O'Brien.  Yeah.  Ooh, yeah, you're so fucking hot.  I have no problem with it.  Oh, you're so fucking hot, and I'm gonna, you know what, I'm gonna, I'm gonna fuck you.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, I thought you were gonna work on my car, we're both naked, and you got a heart on, and  this is real good stuff, you're splurting out here. 
[01:26:30]  You reminded me of something.  Sex talk awful.  Chris Rockoff, that famous album.  I just want to groan like Terry Schiavo, in fact.  Leave me alone.  She actually has to look like she's taking the money shot all day long.  All right, Jesus.  I mean, am I lying?  It's the end of every porno.  Her face.  Wow.  Oh, is that awful?  I'll do my angle on that one, too.  God.  Anthony, you remind me of something, Chris Rock did a whole bit on that, phone sex, on 
[01:27:00]  that, that, the famous album.  Yeah, with, what's her name, uh, the tall, dykey, uh, comedian, I forgot her name.  Every girl comedian?  Uh, Judy.  Uh, Judy Gold.  Oh, yeah.  I thought you meant Paula Poundstone.  Oh, yeah, uh, Alan DeGeneres.  Maybe we can find that.  It's one of the bits he did in between the comedy.  DeGeneres, all of them.  It's exactly what you're talking about, you know, trying to have phone sex with a girl, and  she's really not into it.  Phone sex or just being in bed and trying to, like, you know, talk dirty?  It just doesn't work. 
[01:27:30]  I slapped my own ass once.  Stop it.  I swear to God.  What?  Did you get confused?  No, I really just got into it.  Me and my friend were actually doing a train on a girl, and I was behind her.  Another romantic moment by now with one of our comedian friends.  Boy, big surprise here.  She was, you know, doing, blowing him.  Yeah.  And she was really, she was kind of, I was kind of lonely.  I was, you know, just doing my thing.  Sure.  Slapping her ass, and I got so into it, I was like, just whack.  And I whacked my own ass. 
[01:28:00]  But the sound of my ass and the sound of her ass is, like, hers was, like, nice and firm,  smack, and, like, and mine was just, like, like a, and everybody just turned around and  looked at me and was like, did you just slap your own ass?  That nice rune in the moment, yeah.  I was like, yeah, I guess.  That is flabby ass muffled by hair.  It is really like cottage cheese and raw chicken.  Panage in a garbage bag.  That is really weird, bro.  Half blown up garbage bag.  All right, we got lots we can do here. 
[01:28:30]  You want to listen to the Chris Rock thing real fast?  Sure.  It's okay, but, I mean, you just mentioned it, so now it makes a little bit of sense.  Derek, let's play that real fast.  There's nothing worse than bad phone sex.  I don't know.  I just, I don't feel comfortable doing this, Chris.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  So what do you have on?  Underwear.  Come on.  Don't say underwear.  You panties.  You don't have panties, right?  What kind of panties?  Um, it's like a tweed lycra blend. 
[01:29:00]  Don't tell me to tell you.  What am I, Taylor?  Come on, what's the cut?  The panties.  The G-string.  The thong.  Come on, come on.  Okay, okay.  You miss me?  Yeah.  What you gonna do when you see me?  Um, I don't know.  Talk.  Told you.  You want me to hold you back? 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  You want me to kiss you?  Hmm.  Yeah, I guess so.  You want me to eat your pussy?  Hmm.  Whatever.  Do you mean whatever?  Do you want me to eat your pussy?  Eventually, I guess.  It'll get there.  I mean...  Yeah, I mean...  I don't know.  Could you just say it?  If you want it, say it. 
[01:30:00]  All right, um...  You want me to eat your pussy?  I would like it if...  You ate my pussy.  Ate your what?  My pussy.  Excuse me?  Your pussy?  What?  If I ate your what?  My pussy.  Okay, okay. 
[01:30:30]  And what are you gonna do to me?  Hmm.  Touch your arm.  Huh?  Why can't you touch my arm for?  Well, you know.  I'll rub it.  You gonna rub my arm?  Uh-huh.  What the fuck?  I ain't in a fight.  I ain't fall down.  All right, I'll massage your neck.  And you have to go lower.  Uh...  I'll kiss your ear.  Fuck.  Hey, honey, honey. 
[01:31:00]  You got to go lower than that.  Uh...  What if I rub your tummy?  Lower.  Lower.  All right.  I'll touch your penis.  My penis?  Huh?  My penis?  Uh-huh.  The fuck are you talking about penis?  What the fuck?  Penis?  Penis?  What's this penis shit?  It's dick. 
[01:31:30]  Dick.  My dick.  What am I, a fucking doctor?  Damn!  There you go.  Some bad phone sex.  That is some awful phone sex.  That's how it is, though, right?  That's how it turns out.  That's the reality of it.  That's how it turns out when you try to have phone sex with a dyke.  Look at this instant feedback.  Bob Kelly is so fucking hot.  I want to lick his ass, or he can lick my cock if he wants.  Oh, John from Albany, it says.  I'll let him lick my ass.  I don't give a shit. 
[01:32:00]  All right, so the Pat O'Brien sex tapes.  We've got to play a few of these before break, Anthony.  Yeah.  I think we start off with one that had a lot of potential and then went horribly wrong.  Oh, yeah, we were listening to this one in the office.  The guy had a good idea, but execution pretty bad.  I think he then just panicked.  Yeah.  Old panicky Pete.  I want to fucking go crazy with you.  I want to fucking make you crazy.  I, I, I...  Make you fucking crazy. 
[01:32:30]  You are so fucking hot.  You are so fucking hot.  I want to lick your poopsie and suck your tits.  All I can use is to get this magic.  Just look at me and say yes.  I'm higher on the group.  Let's get crazy.  You are so fucking hot. 
[01:33:00]  You are so fucking hot.  I want you badly.  I know you want me.  Looks like I have sex.  Hey, it's me.  I'm so fucking in you. 
[01:33:30]  So let's have fun.  Let's just fucking have fun.  Oh, shut my cock.  If you agree with this,  Actually, it's not that bad the second time.  It wasn't as bad as we first thought it was.  Yeah, it really wasn't bad.  We thought he was putting the cliffs over the Aussie vocals.  Yeah, no, he did a good job. 
[01:34:00]  It kind of got confusing, but it wasn't that bad.  That wasn't that bad.  That was nice.  I love that he said, let's have fun.  You know, that's right when somebody walked by him on the cell phone.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm going to eat your ass.  Well, let's have fun.  We'll have a fun time.  I want to find those documents we were looking for.  Nickels, dime quarters.  Anthony, one of the listeners suggested that we take the Pat O'Brien sex tapes  and edit it like we were on commercial radio.  Yeah.  This is how other shows have to play the sex tapes.  Right.  Just a little sample.  FCC rules. 
[01:34:30]  See?  Nothing.  They're not allowed to hear one word of it.  Is that what you're going for?  What happened?  What happened?  That's a new problem.  Uh-oh.  It's playing.  It is playing.  Did you burn a bad disc?  Hmm.  Eric.  Eric.  Poor Eric.  What did you do?  All right.  Go see what's going on with that.  Play that elsewhere.  We'll play another Pat O'Brien sex tape mix from the listeners, okay? 
[01:35:00]  This is from Ass Suck from whackbag.com.  The Ass Suck?  The Ass Suck.  Nice.  If we get the CD player to go here.  Uh-oh.  Maybe we should get a new CD player.  It's these Denons.  That one seems a little...  They do take a lot of abuse, especially from you.  The first thing Opie does when something doesn't work with the CD player is hit the CD player real hard.  I can't wait until he has kids.  Call the little kid Denon.  Suck him in the head, Mac. 
[01:35:30]  All right.  Here's Ass Suck from whackbag.com.  Save message Sunday, 9, 04, 10.  I want to not to go crazy with you.  You are so fucking hot.  I fucking have sex.  Yeah.

[01:36:30]  You're not feeling that one?  I'm not very impressed.  It's like a little musical bed.  Some sound clips and, yeah.  I'm not impressed.  Not very clever.  Sorry.  Who was that?  Um, Ass Suck.  Ass Suck.  You're going to hurt his feelings.  I know.  I'll go on the message board later and, you know.  You're going to hurt Ass Suck's feelings.  Do you think all of them are good?  I'm impressed with his name.  Well, Ass Suck.  Ass Suck is good.  Steve said that one was okay, not great.  Well, let's try this one. 
[01:37:00]  I would say even worse than okay.  Yeah, that one was.  It was just kind of, eh.  Well, Steve, you know, warned us that there's some bad ones in this batch, so.  Steve slips those in to make him look really good.  Of course he does.  Well, here's Eric coming back in.  Here it is on, you know, if you had to edit this for commercial radio.  You are so **** hot.  And I want to ****.  I don't want to ****.  I don't want to ****. 
[01:37:30]  I don't want to ****.  You're so **** hot.  You are **** hot.  Let's do it.  You are so **** hot.  Please leave me a voicemail.  Go to the bathroom and leave me a voicemail.  Bye.  Saved message.  That's no joke.  You bleeped out only stuff.  Hey, it's me.  I am so ****ing to you.  And you have to pay attention to Betsy, but let's have fun.  I want to **** you and **** you and **** you and **** you and **** you and watch

I'm so ****ing to you.  It's so ****ing hot.  You missed one.  You missed one.  You son of a ****.  Fired.  Fired.  Fired.  Fired.  We would have been suspended.  Look at that ****.  Holy crap.  We would have been suspended.  You missed one. 
[01:38:30]  You missed one.  And I felt like we were back on commercial radio.  I just had that feeling inside.  I got scared for a second.  I just went out over the air.  I'm like, oh no, dump.  Let's just **** me have fun.  I'm so ****ing to you.  You're ****ing hot.  What happened there, Slick?  It's just like, all of a sudden, that **** went ****.  The dreams that get together, I want to **** you.  **** your ****.  **** dirty to you.  Watch your best **** each other. 
[01:39:00]  **** my ****.  **** your face.  Yeah, when you hear a beep in your face, you pretty much know what that beep was.  It sounds like Tracy Morgan's Comedy Central special.  Beep, beep, beep.  White people.  Beep, beep.  Black people.  There you go.  That's why they're not playing it on commercial radio.  Man, I didn't think it would be that bad, but wow.  That is all.  You couldn't play that. 
[01:39:30]  You could not.  How could you play that on regular radio with all those beeps?  I don't know.  Let's play another one from the listeners, another remix with the Pat O'Brien sex tapes.  Better than Ass Sucks.  Year is this, 1935?  I want to **** go crazy with you.  Who's this?  I'm so **** into you.  Dad?  You are so **** hot.  Thanks.  I'm **** you.  Your tits.  Oh my God. 
[01:40:00]  I don't want you badly.  I don't know you want me.  I don't know.  I want to lick your pussy and suck your tits.  Where?  Go to the bathroom and let me a push now.  Oh my God.  I don't believe you.  I just **** have sex and fun.  Drugs.  **** me.  Bye.  Wow.  Genius.  Best one yet.  Holy ****.  Took the old Bill's head call. 
[01:40:30]  We'll have to get the best ones up on foundrymusic.com.  God damn it.  Who did that?  I don't know.  We don't.  That is genius.  We've got to give credit to these guys.  You're kidding.  Oh no.  I want to hear that again.  Screw going to the next one.  Oh man.  Can I hear it?  I got to hear that one more time.  It's short enough.  Let's play it again.  Basically it's yeah Pat obviously and the old lady from the Bill's dead phone call.  The old lady that called up and Opie told her her friend was dead and she couldn't believe  it.  But it fits in very well with the Pat O'Brien audio. 
[01:41:00]  And of course I like her phone ring.  Because she would have an old phone.  Of course.  Hi.  I want to fucking go crazy with you.  Who's this?  I'm so fucking into you.  Pat?  You're so fucking hot.  Thanks.  I want to fuck you.  Your tits.  Oh my God.  I want you badly.  I know you want me.  Oh no.  I want to lick your pussy and suck your tits.  Laugh. 
[01:41:30]  Go to the bathroom and let me get a push now.  Oh my God.  I don't believe it.  I just fucking have sex and fun and drugs.  Fuck it.  Me.  Go crazy.  Bye.  Bye.  That is too funny.  You pick up that she says Pat?  Pat?  In the phone call too?  You're kidding.  I don't believe it.  I cannot get enough of these sex tapes.  Wow.  We need a sound board.  We need all sorts of stuff.  That is really good. 
[01:42:00]  Oh wow.  Yeah.  Steve will take the best ones and throw them up on the websites tonight.  And give you guys credit.  If we know who did them.  Phew.  Want to do one more before we break?  I don't know how you follow that one.  I know.  I know.  You're learning radio school to end on an up note.  I love that accent.  Oh no.  It sounds like everybody's grandmother.  I know, right?  You're kidding me, Bill.  Oh my God.  Where?  Oh my God. 
[01:42:30]  Hello?  Hello?  Where?  Egg.  You know what?  Before we play the next one, just so it makes sense to the new listeners,  We now have to play the Bill's Dead phone call really fast.  Yeah, I love this.  We're just kind of screwing off today anyway.  We're a day before vacation.  Yep.  This is where he got the voice from. 
[01:43:00]  The famous cruel and unusual.  The famous Bill's Dead phone call.  Hello?  Hi.  Hi.  Bill.  Who's this?  Pat.  Hi Pat, how are you?  Now this is the wrong Bill.  Well, Pat, I have some bad news.  What?  Bill died today.  Yeah, kid.  Oh my God.  Yeah.  Tragic.  Who's this?  He was in a car accident today. 
[01:43:30]  Oh no.  Who is this?  It's John.  John?  Yeah.  Oh boy.  Oh my God.  I don't believe it.  Yeah.  I was just talking to him.  I know.  Where did it happen?  Uh, this afternoon.  Where?  On the highway.  Oh God, love him. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah, big, big, big pile up.  Well, be sure and give the kids my condolences.  Okay.  Well, I gotta go.  Alright, John.  Alright.  Thanks.  Bye.  Bye.  Oh no.  How did it happen?  Where?  Where?  Sounds like my grandmother, man.  The Boston Hanks says just... 
[01:44:30]  Where?  Where?  Bobby, where are you going?  Where?  Up there by Revere?  Where?  Exactly, dude.  It sounds like my goddamn grandmother.  Oh, God love him.  Oh, right over here, my friend.  Oh, truffles, yes.  Truffle time.  Truffles.  Truffles for everyone.  Are you a room mother?  It's like first grade.  Oh.  Passing around with snacks.  Mmm.  Alright, why don't we play another one from the listeners?  God, these things rock.  No one knows where these came from? 
[01:45:00]  Steve?  You're not just a bad...  Yeah, I'll go through them and make sure...  I'll make sure when they get posted, we will credit everybody, but they came in so fast  and furious, and some came in anonymously, it was just...  We lost track.  Alright, we just want to get them on the air.  Bitches are fat slobs.  Oh, my God.  Sitting around all day eating this shit.  I won't have one of those.  That's very good.  Mmm.  Anthony, here's another one sent in from the listeners.  Check this one out.  You rang? 
[01:45:30]  Hey, it's me.  Yeah.  I want you badly.  I know you want me.  I've got some deluge.  Let's just fucking have fun.  I'm so fucking hot.  I don't do this for living.  It's like new to me.  Yeah.  But I want to fucking make you crazy.  You got it.  Go to the bathroom.  Yeah, it's in the bathroom.  What's that?  Yeah, I'm on my way.  I want to fucking make you cum so much. 
[01:46:00]  Here's a bathtub.  I've got my rubber magic tongue.  I want to fucking read off your face.  It's all the dumb.  You're so fucking hot.  Well, we're trying to help my butt now.  I'm working it in.  I want you.  You want me?  Yeah.  I'm picking up speed, dicey me fast. 
[01:46:30]  I don't want you to do something hot.  I don't want to fuck you.  Yeah.  Don't want to fuck you.  I don't want to fuck you.  I'm so crazy with you.  Yeah.  I don't want to fuck you.  Yeah.  Kill me.  Please.  I want you to fuck you.  I'm so crazy with you.  Yeah, oh, marvelous.  All right, go wash my ass.  Adios.  Bye-bye.  All right, that's another good one.  Wheelchair Fred.  Old Wheeler Durf himself. 
[01:47:00]  And Pat O'Brien.  Wow, that's pretty good.  Who did that one?  I don't know.  No credits today for this genius?  I know.  Well, we're going to get the best ones up on the websites,  and then they'll get full credit up there.  And we encourage you to keep sending them in while we're on vacation.  When we come back, we'll play more.  You know, maybe we'll give out a MiFi or something to the best one.  The Bill's Dead is still my favorite, but that Wheelchair Fred one is right up there.  Oh, yeah.  We have another, like, ten to go. 
[01:47:30]  Today?  Yeah.  Poor Pat O'Brien.  This ass had no idea when he was leaving this goddamn message.  What an idiot leaving these messages.  I don't trust a goddamn single woman on the fucking planet.  You're going to leave these recorded like that on her phone?  You're Pat O'Brien.  You know, you're kind of in the public eye.  She's got these things on tape.  What the hell do you think she's going to do?  Oh, man.  And then the other bombshell was the fact that the chick Betsy that he talks about,  she was married. 
[01:48:00]  She leaves her husband because of this affair with Pat O'Brien.  Her ex-husband now has a picture of Pat O'Brien jerking off.  What?  Yeah.  He's got a picture.  I guess Betsy had it in her house.  The husband found it, and now it's in his possession.  So now where it is, this thing is going to be out any day now,  is this glistening, sweaty Pat O'Brien jacking off picture.  It's going to make the rounds.  Oh, gee, that just sucks. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  I actually, when I first got a video camera, I videotaped myself having sex  with a bunch of girls, and I had all my friends over.  But the first day I got it, I videotaped myself jacking off.  I never saw myself jacking off what I looked like.  It was atrocious.  Oh, God.  It was in the middle of the day, too, so that afternoon sunbeam was shooting  in on my gray sack.  You're kidding.  Where?  You don't need a video camera to know how awful you look whacking off. 
[01:49:00]  If you have a pet that you live with, that's all you need.  You ever, like, whacking off and, like, your cat or your dog is looking at you?  You can tell by the reaction in your pet how awful you look.  My dog did this one day.  I was jerking off.  I looked over at my dog.  He went, I actually put my dog in a depression.  Look who owns me.  I was videotaping. 
[01:49:30]  I erased me jerking off.  And then I had all this, like, three chicks.  It was great.  Yeah.  And then I was showing my friends, but there was one little snippet.  Of course.  There's always a little snippet left.  Of me just, ugh.  My legs were together, too.  So my fat legs and my sack was, like, just pushed out, like, ugh.  It was just a little tight tranny sack.  And I was jerking off.  And just one second of whomp.  And all you hear is, whoa, whoa, whoa.  And ugh.  It's, like, subliminal, you know, it just kind of gets in you and goes, I want to see 
[01:50:00]  Bob Jack off.  And I need some popcorn.  Just because it was interesting.  Well, that is really nasty.  Were you watching it on a TV screen also, like, monitoring it?  Yeah, we were watching it.  No, I mean, you and yourself when you were doing it.  Yeah, I had it on a monitor.  You didn't just do it and then go, let me play back and watch it?  No, no, no, no.  Yeah, because it's one thing if you set up a camera and then monitor as you're doing it.  But if you tape it and then watch it later, what are you going to do?  Sit down and, yeah, look at me jerking. 
[01:50:30]  That's great.  It's like game film.  You have to go back and.  Scouting report.  You know, you've got to make some notes.  You need a little more wrist action.  Well, I was doing it because I was going to have the girls over, so you had to kind of  know where you're out of the shot.  So I wanted to, I put, like, tape down.  Yeah, Bob, yeah, I want you to come over.  I want you to watch videos of me jerking off.  You can do that, right?  Then we can fuck.  We can watch some more of me jerking off.  You want to watch videos of me jerking off? 
[01:51:00]  I cum all over my belly.  Yeah.  I'm so fucking hot.  I drive me crazy.  Oh, wait, my dog's yawning.  Hold on.  Did you video yourself jerking off to show girls?  No, I was video.  First of all, I've never seen myself.  I never, I never knew what I look like.  I've never seen an underneath shot of me taking a shit either, but I really wouldn't want  to.  If you could, you wouldn't want to just check it out?  Yeah, but you've been in hotels where there's probably mirrors in the bathroom.  Yeah, but I've never seen what I look like.  Jacking it in the shower, you look over and you go, oh, damn, look at that. 
[01:51:30]  I never saw what I look like.  Fuck in the sink.  Maybe see a reflection of a chrome faucet.  Like a funhouse mirror.  There's something else going on here, because everyone has seen themselves jerk off in front  of a mirror or something.  I wanted to see what I look like, like, you know, on video.  Okay.  You know what I mean?  Where you're not really looking at the...  I'm not looking, I'm looking at who's, like, that, that's not me.  It's, you know, that's me, but it's not me.  You know what I mean?  When you look at yourself in the mirror, which I've done many a times, it's not the same.  But if you see, when you see yourself on TV, you don't understand, like, you don't 
[01:52:00]  understand how, you know, what you look like.  Right.  So you just wanted it on video.  I just wanted to check it out.  Anytime you get new technology, you want to fuck around with it.  Give it a good Bob Saget introduction, wacky sound effect.  Boing!  When you get new technology, you want to figure out how to use it for sex.  That's all.  That's what everyone does.  Mankind.  Yes.  Internet, you start with sex stuff and then realize, hey, wow, I could do other things on  here.  Yeah.  So you decided to. 
[01:52:30]  All right.  And your friends got a little shot.  We should take a break.  Bob Kelly's sitting in for Jim Norton.  Hopefully Norton will check in and say hi.  I heard he killed down there in Lauderdale last night.  So any plugs, Bob?  Torgasm.  What?  I'm doing Torgasm.  Dane Cook.  You know Dane, right?  Yes.  Yeah.  Me, Dane Cook.  Gary Gullman.  You know Gary Gullman.  Of course.  And this kid.  Gullman, my producer.  Not that one.  Not that Gullman.  We're touring.  We're going from the West Coast to the East Coast.  20 schools in 30 days. 
[01:53:00]  Schools?  Yeah.  Schools.  Colleges.  But it's like big colleges.  It's like 2000.  We're doing the theaters.  So you're going to like high schools or something?  No, no, no, no.  Stay off the drill.  Yeah, this should really help your addiction.  Real smart, Bob.  College girls.  Bob's trying to, you know, play it straight these days and not fuck around on the road.  And you sign up for a college tour.  I have no...  College.  You know what?  You're insane.  I have no problem with college girls.  You have openly admitted you're addicted to sex and you're trying to be cool and you sign  up for this tour. 
[01:53:30]  You should be touring the old age homes.  That's actually what turns me on.  Wham.  My balls right there.  Sucked up.  This isn't Bob Kelly.  Where can they get info on this tour?  Torgasm.com.  It's touring the country.  We've got a big bus.  That's cool.  Like one of those usher bushes.  Nice.  You've got to call us from the road.  I will.  With your road stories.  That'll be fun.  I've got to figure out a way to put the roadie two in the bus.  Yeah, because I want to play you guys in the bus. 
[01:54:00]  Just get a mi-fi.  Just get the mi-fi.  Look them up with a mi-fi, man.  What the fuck?  According to Ben, they're starting to hand out the mi-fis to our comedian friends that  help us out when Norton's not here.  So maybe we can get you one.  Oh, Ben's giving the thumbs up.  You have one in-house?  I'm not here yet.  Not here yet, but we'll...  I know that was a problem because they became so popular that they...  It became a problem to actually produce that many, but now I think they have a bunch of  Taiwanese children soldering them together for like two bucks a week.  You know what?  A week.  It's the only way to listen to XM.  Yeah.  I mean, I got... 
[01:54:30]  What do I got?  I got like a Delphi on my ride.  Uh-huh.  But the mi-fi, that's what it's about.  Yeah.  Recording shows and all that.  Portably, take it with you.  It's ridiculous.  Yeah, hook Bob up with a mi-fi.  We'll hook you up.  I'll definitely call you from the road, but yeah, it's going to be crazy.  It's going to be crazy.  Quick break.  Drew Boogie's in-house.  When we get back, we have an assault on the media that happened in Little Rock, Arkansas.  This thing is starting to spread.  Nice.  We love this.  When listeners get involved, they see the live shot of the news happening somewhere.  You know, in your town, they always got these things going.  The camera crew sets up in front of a location that's in the news, and the reporter goes live 
[01:55:00]  during the newscast.  And one of our idiot pestering buffoons that listen to this program go up behind the reporter  and hold up either a wow sign or, in one case, a sign that said cunt on Channel 4.  Oops.  Yeah, that was a good one.  Oops.  We call that one the A-bomb.  Yeah.  And that's called an assault on the media.  It's our own way to promote the show.  We got another one that came in, and also the guy that made the Pat O'Brien scorecard.  He's outside the studio.  His name's Dave.  And he redid it just a little bit, so our names are going to get out there. 
[01:55:30]  Another way to spread the virus of the radio program.  That's up on opianthony.com and foundyourmusic.com.  I think it's already on newgrounds.com, and it's coming soon to farc.com, Anthony,  consumptionjunction.com.  This thing is going to go everywhere.  Thanks to that guy right there, Dave.  We'll get him in here to check out the show as well.  But first, Drew Boogie, get us out of here.  You're happy now?  You're a whore.  I know. 
[01:56:00]  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  You're happy now?  You're happy now?  You're a whore.  I know.  I know.  I know.  It's the O.B.  and Anthony Show. 
[01:56:30]  You're home for good, clean, wholesome family entertainment.  Wow.  That is such a long way to go just to say.  Oh, it's the O.B.  Oh, it's the O.B. 
[01:57:00]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  I know, Anthony.  Ha, ha, ha.  XM202.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Go. 
[01:57:30]  Right on, man. 
[01:58:00]  Drew Boogie in the house, spinning for us today.  Nice.  And he plugs, Drew.  Ah, your mic's not on.  There we go.  Not a one.  I got nothing.  I know.  We've got to figure something out with you, man.  He does a lot of great stuff for the radio program.  Matter of fact, going into break, you've got to play the Stalker Patty creation that Drew Boogie did.  It's amazing.  It's my favorite one that you've done lately.  Oh, yeah.  That's like a legitimate song.  It really is.  That thing is really cool.  Everybody can sing along.  I want to say hi to the people at FARC.com.  I just noticed the link is up. 
[01:58:30]  You can see the flash animation of Pat O'Brien right there on FARC.com.  Yeah, we've got to get Steve on the microphone because, oh, my God, this is awesome for the radio program.  That's why we call it Spread the Virus.  We'll do it any way we can, man.  And this guy, Dave Outside, came up with this great, like, flash animation thing, you know, that's, you know, the Pat O'Brien sex tapes.  Yeah.  And we put it up on our website.  And then, you know, Steve has connections out the ass, so now it's all over the place.  Yeah.  So far, we've got it on Newgrounds. 
[01:59:00]  You can go and vote for it there.  FARC, you can go and vote for it there.  Working on getting it on Consumption Junction, College Humor, BigBoys.com.  And, you know, we'll post it as many places as we possibly can.  And some people just pick it up before we have a chance to contact them.  And this is all in the last, eh, 45 minutes, too.  Yeah.  And our names are associated with it.  Found your music.  It's a scorecard, basically, keeping track of all the things that Pat wants to do to this woman.  Done very well.  Done very, very well.  All right.  And then Tyson Walter is in studio from the Dallas Cowboys. 
[01:59:30]  He was talking about some other things that he could get fined for.  What's the one about your weight?  Yeah, these truffles here.  Reminded you of something?  Reminded me that, yeah, for each pound per day, $362, that you're overweight.  Wait, they give you an actual weight you're supposed to be at?  Yeah, you have an assigned weight.  Different teams are different.  Jesus, man.  My rookie year, we had weights, but we didn't have any penalty for it.  But currently, yeah, you can be fine.  What's your assigned weight?  Last year, it changed a little bit. 
[02:00:00]  Last year, it was 3.03.  Yeah.  What are you at now?  3.06 at the moment.  So, just started working out a few weeks ago, so I started putting some weight back on.  So, you don't want to eat those truffles.  That could cost you a lot of money.  I've got until August.  I got that.  Fine.  You'll be just fine.  Bob is just popping them in his mouth.  He goes, they're just too easy to do this.  He picks one up.  The whole thing goes in his mouth.  My feet are tingling.  I'm having a diabetic seizure right now.  Fat mess I am. 
[02:00:30]  You are good, man.  I'm going to pass out in a minute.  All right.  Well, Dave Manick in New Orleans, he did a little assault on the media in Little Rock.  Yeah, Little Rock.  KATV was doing some kind of St. Paddy's, I don't know, weather forecast.  And this ass just disrupted his weather forecast by yelling Opie and Anthony.  We love this, Anthony, right?  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely love this.  And we encourage this.  Just don't physically harm the reporters out there.  No, no. 
[02:01:00]  You don't touch them at all.  But get creative.  We still haven't seen any real creative ones since we've been back on radio.  Oh, the old ones from N.E.W. when we were there?  Forget about it.  Some of these people.  The one guy, my favorite guy in gorilla suit.  What about the guy that dressed up as Gumby?  That was pretty good, too.  But I loved the guy in the gorilla suit.  I don't remember that one.  He was just jumping around behind somebody.  And I think it was like a real bad chemical leak story.  Some kind of nuclear plant story.  And the person was very serious on the news.  Big chance for a nice serious story. 
[02:01:30]  And he's doing his read.  And a guy in a gorilla suit just comes running behind him.  And you hear through his mouth,  I'll be amazed at me.  I'll be amazed at me.  Jumping around like a nut.  Was that the same one where the guy had a sign  and just placed it right in front of the reporter's face  as he was doing the serious news story, too?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, here's the latest assault on the media.  Check this one out.  7 News News.  Channel 7 News at 6.  Now, your first forecast with Chief Meteorologist, Ned Fermi. 
[02:02:00]  Hi, everybody.  The river market is crawling with green on this St. Patrick's Day.  And we are having the first annual St. Patrick's Pub Crawl.  Coming up tonight, we're going to talk about that.  Coming up in just a few minutes.  We've got a great night for it.  Lots of sunshine.  It's a day where we all put on our green.  That's right.  And then a lot of people go out.  And that's what Ned Fermi's doing.  So you want to come down early and get your wristband.  All the music starts playing about 7 o'clock tonight. 
[02:02:30]  And it's a great, great way to enjoy yourself in one location  right here in the River Market District on your St. Patrick's Day.  We had a beautiful day today.  Lots of sunshine moved back into the...  They got him twice.  What an ass.  He's just running by.  Oh, what an annoying fool.  I love these guys.  They try to make believe it's not happening.  What an idiot. 
[02:03:00]  That guy got him twice.  I love it.  Oh, man.  Bravo.  That's hilarious.  I know.  They really are.  Bzz.  Bzz.  Annoying bastards.  We got Flea from CringeHumor.net checking in.  Let's see what he has.  Flea, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, Bob.  I'm a big fan.  I'm just wondering, you went to Iraq recently with Steve Byrne and Colin Quinn, right?  Yeah, I actually did Flea.  Well, I'm just wondering, do you have any stories from going over there? 
[02:03:30]  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  He's so...  You are so...  I know exactly what's happening here.  You're so gun-shy that he's going to do something to creep on you.  Yeah, I know.  I'm waiting for him to go, not you.  Not you.  Yeah, it couldn't possibly be a real question asking you about your Iraq experience.  Well, you understand.  No, no.  My instant messenger goes off.  I'm...  Okay, Flea.  He's gone.  He's gone.  Is he gone?  Well, yeah.  Well, my instant...  I'm on IM all the time, and it used to be a nice little happy place for me. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  I'd probably get one or two.  But now I get people that'll IM me and be like, hey, man, I heard you're on O&A.  You're awesome.  And I'm such a lonely douche.  I'm like, thanks, man.  Not you.  And they write back, not you.  And they just sign off.  That's the worst part.  Is they sign off.  There's the thought they chat with you a minute or two.  Yeah, so I'm like, hey...  And it's just auto-response.  I'm like, son of a bitch.  But, yeah, man, Iraq was...  First of all, Colin Quinn is literally out of his mind. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  We're on the friggin' helicopter.  It's like two in the morning.  I look over.  He's got his pants down.  Why?  I don't know.  I just look over.  And the guys in the gun, they walked over to him and were like, why do you have your  pants down?  Like, it wasn't even a fucking joke.  Yeah, it wasn't funny or anything.  He was like, I don't know.  I just pull my pants down sometimes.  And he just muddled and put them back up like...  You ass.  Why would you do that?  They're sitting here with night vision goggles on, holding a .50 caliber, trying not to get  us killed, and you're pulling your pants down. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah, perhaps you should save the hijinks for the safety of the base.  Oh, me and him, it was just that, the actual, the base that we were on, what's his name's  palace?  Yeah.  They have all the animals.  What's his name?  Udo.  Uday?  Uday.  I thought you were going to say Saddam.  I thought you were going to say Saddam.  It's like, what's his name?  No, he's got...  That guy.  Uzi Watson.  He made like 30 palaces.  He's got like 30 palaces.  And this one was actually a hunting ground.  It's huge.  We have three bases, American bases, on this one palace.  Really?  In Baghdad. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah.  And I love it, too, because we didn't bomb the palaces when we went over there, because  they were like, they go, yeah, we're going to be staying here.  Of course.  And you should see it.  All the lieutenants, the colonels, they all have these slamming pads, and all the grunts  are intense.  But these guys are in like the Bellagio.  They got like rooms out of Bellagio.  I'm not kidding you.  They have a Bellagio to themselves.  I swear to God, they have these rooms with balconies, and they're out there smoking  cigars.  You're on chips for all the lieutenants.  The dancers will kick your tongue out.  God, these guys are brilliant. 
[02:06:00]  You would think they would just go in and destroy the palaces right away.  No.  They're smarter than us.  They threw...  They shot one...  Two bombs.  There was actually a bridge going to one of the palaces, and the other...  I went into Saddam's bedroom in the main palace, and it has all drop ceilings like  this.  And it's...  You know, he goes, those are drop ceilings, because we shot...  They shot a bomb through the window.  Into his bedroom.  Just blew up his bedroom.  Just to let him know we were coming.  How fantastic is that?  That's the only room that they hit in that one palace. 
[02:06:30]  Ding dong.  Hello.  Anyone home?  That's fantastic, man.  They are...  These lunatics over there actually let all the animals loose.  The lions, a panther.  I mean, all these freaking psychotic animals, just let them loose.  So...  But when you're over there, they're still loose.  Yeah.  No one...  Somewhere on the ground.  Scoop them up.  So you're walking around, and there's no lights at night.  This place is huge.  You can actually walk around, and...  But they're like, yeah, be careful, because we haven't found the lions.  And who's feeding the animals? 
[02:07:00]  Nobody's feeding them.  So they're hungry at this point.  They're probably hungry, but there's other animals like kangaroos, gazelles.  They're all out there.  It's like a big, huge place.  Yeah.  They found two cubs.  Two lion cubs.  So they've been having sex.  So they've been screwing around.  Yeah.  I want to fuck you, you tiger.  It's like Neverland Ranch.  It's unbelievable.  I actually saw...  I'm not even fucking...  I know you're going to fucking laugh at me, but I saw a werewolf.  Yeah.  Well, you touched on this briefly.  Listen to me.  What kind of werewolf?  It was a werewolf, man. 
[02:07:30]  I'm not...  Listen, I know what a wolf looks like.  A coyote, a dog.  I've fucking seen them all.  It's a werewolf.  It had a guy chest, like a human...  And it was like...  I'm not in...  It was like this high.  Glowing eyes.  Almost like a horse.  But a wolf, but a guy.  Did it walk on two feet?  It had four feet.  It was a werewolf.  It wasn't like, you know...  Well, werewolves are like, you know, Lon Chaney or something.  Werewolves in London.  It was a... 
[02:08:00]  Their hair was perfect.  You know, they walk around on two feet.  And they wear...  Oh, yeah.  No, no, no.  That's from American Werewolf in London.  Yeah, that happened.  That was pretty good, Derek.  Go Warren Zevon.  Werewolves in London.  Werewolves in London.  And they walk around and they wear old-timey suits.  Yeah.  Right?  But they walk on two legs.  But this werewolf is...  This was a fully transformed werewolf.  Besides the visual, why do you think it was a werewolf?  Dude, I've never seen...  It was so high off the ground and so big.  Even the guy next to me... 
[02:08:30]  These Marines don't flinch for shit.  Literally, they hear a bomb and they don't move.  And you're like, what was that?  And they're like, don't worry about it.  And it's like, why don't fucking worry about it?  Wow.  When we got the rocket shot at the plane, I was like, look at the sunset.  He's like, that wasn't a sunset.  That was a rocket.  And I'm like, could you show...  For a sunset?  Show some emotion.  Now, where did you see the werewolf?  It was on Uday's Palace.  We were at night.  Driving back.  You're driving.  So, you looked off to the side of the road?  No, no, no, no.  This sucko crossed in front of our van.  It crossed the street.  And everybody went, holy shit. 
[02:09:00]  It was...  Look it, man.  That was just one of his mistresses that was left behind.  Without the burka.  Freaking eyebrow, hair, and pubic can't connect.  Fucking hair.  Did it turn and look at the car?  No.  It didn't even...  It said, fuck it.  It just walked across the street.  It was almost like, you know what, stop.  And it went into the bush.  Yeah.  And even later that night, I was walking with this guy.  He's like assigned to us.  A sea dog.  He's like a major.  Yeah.  And we're walking out. 
[02:09:30]  And I had to go up the street.  And it's dark as shit.  And he's got a 9mm, but you can't load it.  It's unloaded.  What the fuck is that about?  Look at our...  This is what pisses me off, too.  Our military, we can't drink.  You can't have porno.  You can't have a loaded weapon on the base.  It's all politically correct.  It's all because of CNN and the news.  All they pick up is garbage, and they can't have any mistakes.  How could you tie our troops' hands behind their back to the point where they're not allowed  to carry loaded weapons around on the base? 
[02:10:00]  It's all...  The Italians...  So if there's a terrorist, an insurgent, that runs in, and he's got his dynamite belt on,  and he's heading for an area that you can't unload on him...  No, you have to say, wait a second.  One second.  Let me load up my...  Let me be like Barney Fife and pull the bullet out of my pocket and put it in my revolver?  Yeah.  What?  How did it get to that point?  Because of the news.  They report all just crap, dude.  CNN and all that.  They don't want any mistakes.  And because Arabs don't watch porn, Arabs don't have... 
[02:10:30]  They don't drink.  They don't drink.  Which is bullcrap.  I was talking to one guy.  He goes, a lot of these guys...  Homosexuality.  He goes, you can literally drive on a highway and just see two dudes plowing each other.  They talk about that like a lot of...  And waving.  A lot of these Arab guys are gay.  Yeah.  They have young little, like, wards that they have with them for sex.  Yeah.  And it's a lot of these guys.  He used to...  He said you're driving down the highway, and you'll see two dudes just smash...  They'll pull over and just smash each other on the side of the road.  Really?  And you drive by, and they don't even run. 
[02:11:00]  They'll, like, wave, like, hello.  There's a little chubby guy in a Saturn.  Ah, shit.  Wow.  That's a good cue, because he's on the phone right now.  Is he?  Jimmy.  Hi, guys.  There's my pal.  How are you?  Bob Kelly is killing you today.  We miss you.  Yeah, I know.  I bet you he's doing great.  I can finally hear you guys, by the way.  All right.  It's nice.  Yeah, we got Wiki up from Washington.  He's taking care of all the problems that we have.  You know, I didn't even think about that.  We haven't had one of those.  I can't hear you on the phones today.  No, Wiki's doing great. 
[02:11:30]  Wiki's the dude that was looking over us yesterday.  People think you're saying Ricky funny.  Wiki.  But it's, no, his nickname is W-I-C-K.  Oh, the guy was kind of overseeing the whole operation.  Yeah.  Yeah, his nickname's Wiki.  He's saying Wiki like Terry.  Dude, you guys, fucking Fort Lauderdale is going to be a huge O&A market.  Really?  It's like, my flight was four hours late last night.  I was as fucking, and I get to the airport, I land.  You know what a fucking peep panic I am when it comes to getting to a gig on time?  Yep.  Eight o'clock show, I land at 8.40. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, my God, you must have been losing your mind.  I was out of my mind, and I finally get to the baggage claim, and I call the guy.  He's outside waiting for me.  And the fucking fruit monkeys who are handling the baggage, 40 minutes to get my fucking luggage.  So I finally get to the gig, and I go on, and they kind of held the show.  And it was probably like over 100 O&A fans there.  Wow.  Which I was amazed, because we didn't really do that much promotion for this gig.  Fort Lauderdale's going to be a fucking huge market for you guys.  It's crazy.  This whole thing is spreading a lot faster than we ever expected. 
[02:12:30]  Dude, they're the same here as they are in Brooklyn or in Staten Island.  It's the same retards everywhere.  Like, I'm not drawn to this radio program.  Wow.  Nice.  Yeah.  Oh, good.  Yeah, you're getting good reviews, too, man.  Actually, great reviews.  I shouldn't say good.  That's fine.  I'm at the Hard Rock.  I fucking hate it, dude.  I fucking hate it here.  Why?  Just because the pillows were like rubber.  You know those rubber Motel 8 pillows you have in a hotel?  Yeah.  I was on the phone at 2 o'clock in the morning just threatening the manager. 
[02:13:00]  I'm like, I'll talk bad about you guys on the radio.  Because I do a country station this morning, which was atrocious.  Because of the pillows?  Dude, it's like the type of thing you put on an old person when they're incontinent.  I need fucking sleep on a rubber pillow.  Yeah.  They're like prison pillows?  Dude, they're exactly like that.  You can give it a homicide on this thing and run it under the sink and then give it to  the next person.  That's hilarious.  Jim, you have to listen to this show on your MyFi because the listeners sent in all their 
[02:13:30]  remixes of the Pat O'Brien sex tapes.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  A couple of them did some really good work.  They're beyond funny.  We also have Tyson Walter in studio.  Oh, cool.  Hey, Tyson.  What's up, man?  What's up, Jim?  How you doing?  We're going to go see the Black Crows tonight here in New York.  Oh, cool.  Cool, cool, man.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  Is Vinny quarterbacking next year?  You don't know.  Vinny?  Tester Verde.  No, I don't think he's going to.  We've got Bledsoe.  You've got Drew Bledsoe.  Oh, right, right, right.  Okay, very nice.  It's time to do a couple years.  I forgot.  We've got to talk about that a little bit later.  Three-year deal, so I think they're going to try and have him start since Bill knows 
[02:14:00]  him pretty well.  Oh, Bledsoe?  Yeah.  All right, cool, because Vinny was getting up there.  I was kind of getting a little annoyed that they were going to keep him around.  Well, I mean, Vinny was a good dude.  I mean, he knows his thing.  I mean, that's the best thing to say about him.  He's the ultimate pro, and he's a great guy.  But, you know, Bledsoe's got him by about 10 years.  Does anybody else notice what a show-stopping asshole I am?  I call up in Florida, and I'm trying to do a football interview.  I really suck.  Jimmy, Eric just handed me Danny the Intern's Ladies' Creation, as far as the sex tapes 
[02:14:30]  go.  Okay.  It's you again.  Listen to this.  Hopefully, you can hear it down the phone line.  Okay.  Safe message Sunday 9-4-10.  I'm so attracted to you.  If you want to suck a cock, I want you to dye your hair blonde and put on a flame shirt.  I want to rub your pussy with a luff of sponge.  I just want to spank you and put nibble clamps on you.  I want to lick your pussy.  We'll have a hooker come over, and she'll want us to eat her pussy, but we won't want  to.  So she'll give back 50 and then leave the room.  If you agree with this, when the phone rings, pick it up and say hello. 
[02:15:00]  End of message.  To erase this message, press 7.  To erase this message, press 7.  To erase this message, press 7.  I like that little extra added thing at the end there.  I do, too.  He kind of played with the soundboard a little bit and got that little, like, he's trying  to arrest the dirty message but couldn't.  Yeah, that was the bit.  Very cool.  The other thing, Bob Kelly's giving us a little inside info as far as your Ozzy photo.  Oh, what about it?  Well, because you guys live in the same building, and you drove him nuts, too, after you got 
[02:15:30]  your pictures with Ozzy.  He didn't drive me nuts.  He called me immediately and was like, where are you?  Where are you?  Dude, I've got to show you something.  Where are you?  I'll be right there.  And then he runs over.  He lets me listen to this clip, but as I looked up, I was cool with it.  I mean, I'm not infatuated with anybody like that, but I know how he is with Ozzy.  But I looked up.  He was actually looking off into the distance, almost like he was thanking God.  All dreamy.  Almost like, you ever go to the mall at Christmas, and you see a little kid just get off Santa's 
[02:16:00]  lap, and they're still staring at Santa?  Like, uh-huh.  Yeah, taken.  It's Santa.  And he just was staring up, and I was like, you are an official loser.  Why am I a loser?  I was happy to meet my hero.  Yeah, but you were happy for four days.  Yeah, of course I was.  Starstruck ass.  I really was.  I don't like your little fucking mall Santa analogy, either.  That was awful.  It was bad, wasn't it?  He looks off into the distance and realizes he has a cum stain on the back of his pants. 
[02:16:30]  Ah, shit.  Who does this show every day?  How you doing?  Fucking Norton is on fire.  Norton, know what's funny?  What?  I saw Bob Kelly through the window, and I'm like, hey, Bob, come on in.  I gave him the stark treatment.  He's like, all right, what are you guys doing?  You're setting me up for something.  I'm like, no, man, you're sitting in for the big guy today.  We're going to give you the star treatment.  Yeah, I heard about Ben said, Ben, call me before.  I was coming back from this country station.  He's like, yeah, dude, call in.  He's like, Bob is on fire.  I'm like, of course.  You know, fucking Bob is funny, man.  I bought two newspapers, three magazines, a book on tape to wait to come in here. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, they made you wait?  No, no, no.  They got me right in.  No, right in, because he's the star today.  But I'm like, don't get too comfortable, because next time you come by and Norton's in that seat,  you will wait that hour and a half again.  Oh, dude, dude, a fucking open is the worst.  You could just, it's just to fuck with you.  Like, you could come in next week and we could be looking for guys who are comedians with  goatees that are bald, and you could be outside jumping up and down, and I'll be like, oh,  we got nobody here that fits that description.  He's shoving those truffles in his mouth like crazy. 
[02:17:30]  They're fucking fantastic, man.  I ate like three of them yesterday.  Yeah, I was saying, off the air, I was saying, you like the truffles, but the problem is you  have to lay on your back and we have to drop them on your chest before he'll eat them.  You have to put them in the microwave for around three seconds.  Jimmy, also, there's a guy, Dave, here.  He made a Pat O'Brien scorecard.  It's up on opianthony.com, and it's being sent all over the internet now.  This thing is hilarious.  It keeps track of all the crazy stuff that Pat's saying in that tape. 
[02:18:00]  Dude, that audio could be the greatest thing ever captured since the Zapruder film.  There's nothing better than that fucking audio.  Just later on or before the show tonight, you have to check out the Flash animation.  It's hilarious.  Can I tell you how good the phone sounds again?  I can't get over how nice this is.  Yeah, when we get back from vacation, we're going to be set to take this to the next level.  I got to tell you, I had a new friend show up at the show last night.  I had gotten emails from this girl named Nikki who owns an escort service down here.  Oh, boy.  Uh-oh.  Dude, I mean a fucking escort service. 
[02:18:30]  And her and her boyfriend, she's dating this guy who used to do porn.  Frankie Blue Jeans, I think his name is Frankie Blue Jeans.  And they're fucking a couple, so I'm like, ah, this is all bullshit.  And then they show up at the gig, and she's going to give me a fucking, an escort today.  Oh.  A fucking, dude, they're all tens.  Really?  They're fucking nothing but porn girls.  He's freaking out.  Phenomenal.  See, now I got it all figured out.  I'm sitting here listening to Jimmy on the phone.  I'm like, he's never this happy.  He's never this happy when he kills on stage. 
[02:19:00]  I'm like, what?  I was seriously thinking in my head, all right, something's going on here.  Now I know.  That's pretty much what it is.  I got a fucking escort coming.  And she was going to come last night, but because of my stupid flight delay, I had to shower  because my fucking ball smelled like a swamp.  So I'm like, I can't have this girl just meet me at the hotel until I shower.  And it was too late.  The girl had to do something.  So today, she'll come in the afternoon.  Oh, in the afternoon.  Yeah, fuck someone else.  You had to do something.  Yeah.  She'll eat somebody else's ass.  Dude, I don't care if she comes over with a log in her teeth. 
[02:19:30]  She was phenomenal, the girl they're going to send me.  I've seen her picture.  Really?  So it's not like the last debacle with the fat whale that came to the room?  Oh, that awful disaster who didn't want to do anything and I gave back 50?  No, that was just a nightmare.  But it serves me right.  That's what happens when you get involved in the game.  I mean, you're going to have that once in a while.  But this is going to be the good payoff.  I think so, yeah.  And they're not even looking for plugs.  I'm like, what's the website again?  Which I can't remember offhand.  They're like, yeah, we don't care about the plugs.  Wow.  Just want to treat Jimmy to some fun.  Dude, they want to keep it on the DL, as we say in the porn business. 
[02:20:00]  We don't care about the plugs.  It's not what they're about.  It's fucking, and she's amazingly hot.  And they're sending me a fucking girl today.  So I can't tell you.  I'm all antsy and happy.  Are you going to tip her?  Or just take a freebie?  I'm like, what should I give her?  And the girl's like, no, it's taken care of.  Like, I was going to ask her.  Wow.  A tip for these girls is probably a lot of money, man.  I mean, more than I can afford.  Because these are girls that, like, that they fly over to, like, you know, for sheiks and that type of shit.  I mean, this is the real deal.  You should at least give her the hep or something.  Oh, she'll walk out with more than she came in with.  Yeah, she's going to leave with a tip, all right. 
[02:20:30]  In six months, she's going to be amazed at those.  She's wearing those clothes that used to fit her in grammar school.  She's like, wow, I can't believe I got four pounds.  Hey, FanDick wants to say hi.  FanDick.  Hey, what's up, guys?  You got Jimmy on the phone.  Jimmy, you were, I mean, I never saw you before, and I thought you were funny on the show, man.  But last night, you killed, dude.  Oh, thank you, man.  Thank you.  Unbelievable.  I appreciate you guys sticking around.  So the other comics were good, right?  They all stretched and did a good job?  Yeah, yeah.  Those three that came before you, they warmed up everybody pretty good.  Yeah, but when you came out, man, I mean, guys, the guy just took over. 
[02:21:00]  He had people crying from start to finish, even the old people.  Sounds like sex with Jimmy.  Much better.  People crying, even the old people.  Yeah, there was like four of them.  And I'm doing my old chair, old lady with the prosthetic legs, but I'm feeling guilty,  and I'm trying to avoid eye contact with the fucking Estelle Getty in the front row.  But yeah, you guys are great, man.  This is going to be a big market for Opie and Anthony, man.  Like, West Palm is a bit of an older crowd, like, you know, they're in their 40s, but  down here, they're fucking different.  I say we sacrifice, and next winter, we do all of our shows from Fort Lauderdale. 
[02:21:30]  Dude, if you came down here during spring break, you're going to be in, like, Miami, right,  before you go away?  I'm in Miami tomorrow, yeah.  How long are you going to be there for?  I'm there until Monday morning.  Oh, okay, because I'm actually going to, I'm like 20 minutes from Miami.  Really?  Yeah, so if you're around, we'll talk when you get down here, if you want to come to  one of the shows, if you can, unless you guys are going out to eat.  Nice.  You should, dude.  That'd be cool.  I'll get in a car and drive up.  I think I'm pretty close to you.  I thought Miami was, like, an hour from here.  No, it's really close.  But you should hear the country station I did this morning.  It was nice, but they were so worried.  Yeah, I wanted to ask you about that. 
[02:22:00]  How is it doing a country show?  Oh, it's fantastic.  It's kind of like doing a hip-hop station, basically, as far as the draw.  Yeah.  They were like a husband-wife team.  They were very nice, but they have no delay button at all.  Oh, and they must have really been nervous.  I freaked out the producer, because I'm like, look, can I say cunt if I use it as an adjective?  Oh, no.  They don't even laugh at jokes like that.  No way.  Dude, they didn't even...  I talked about O.B. Anthony XM.  He's like, wait a minute.  You're from that show in New York that caused a controversy with O.B. Anthony. 
[02:22:30]  I'm like, yeah, we're on XM.  It's great.  But they wouldn't let me talk about XM.  He's like, oh, they're the competition.  But they were actually...  They were very nice.  They were just too nervous that I was going to say something.  And I mentioned the fact that they were all, like, auto dealerships and kind of, like,  porn shops down here.  Yeah.  And they thought that was kind of like pushing the envelope a little bit.  A little risque for their audience.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But they were cool, man.  It was just their audience was all fucking families.  I was going to say, I'm amazed they even had you on.  I am, too.  But everyone's on vacation down here, so they couldn't get me any rock stations.  And Joel said, well, we'll get you a hip-hop station.  I'm like, I'm not...  You have a better chance than me just standing on the club with a fucking tin can and talking 
[02:23:00]  through that.  I'm not going to a fucking hip-hop station and facing that racial aggression.  I'm not doing it.  I just won't do it.  I'm not going to draw.  Or, you know, fucking eight gang members are going to show up and think I was really  funny.  The self-deprecation.  Oh, my God.  Any nice racist talk when the mics were off at the country station?  No.  This guy was in Chicago.  These guys have been all...  He's not like a complete hillbilly.  They just wound up down here doing, like, a country morning family show.  So, no, not really.  Although, I got to confess, I'm fucking on the way home. 
[02:23:30]  The club manager drive me home.  And you know that club version of Brian Adams' Heaven?  No.  Oh, all right.  Well, it came on and I was enjoying it, but maybe...  Ugh.  Yeah, it really was.  Just enjoying and Brian Adams in the same sentence.  Dude, I think I'm a faggot.  I like Jenny from the block.  I downloaded it from fucking Napster.  What?  Oh, he's listening to J-Lo's Jenny on the Block.  Only that one song, though.  I don't go with the gay ones.  Just that one.  Yeah, don't go with the gay ones.  How did you...  You came to it through that song, not cruising, the meatpacking district never tipped you off? 
[02:24:00]  Well, look, if you're rubbing someone's back, it's not gay, because you can always pretend  it is somebody else.  Well, you're dancing to Jenny on the Block.  You just can't pretend it's anything but fucking gay.  I'm still Jenny on the Block.  What?  She's talking about how she made it and...  Yeah, and it's kind of like me.  Oh, Jimmy.  Don't judge the logs that I got.  Do you want to sing along, Jimmy, or what?  What's that?  You want to sing along here?  It's playing in the background.  Do you hear it?  I don't know the lyrics.  Oh, that was the long version. 
[02:24:30]  We don't want the dance mix.  Is there any way, like, when they queue up the song and fast-forward through them,  or you just got to kind of play the whole thing?  Well, let's listen to this.  Go.  Eric?  Yes?  Eric is panicking on the pressure.  What is this?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yo, yo.  We off the block this year.  Went from a low to a lock this year.  Everybody mad at the rocks that I wear.  I know where I'm going, and I know where I'm from.  You had locks in the air.  Yeah, we at the airport out. 
[02:25:00]  Deep blocks.  Who is this?  Who is this guy?  I'm sure he's an upstanding gentleman.  Yeah, but it's not Jenny.  Well, he opens the song.  Oh, he does?  Of course.  Then Jenny comes in.  I know nothing about this fucking song.  Norton knows.  Oh, there's Jenny from the block.  Jimmy, do you have fantasies that you're Jim Lowe?  You're hooked up with her.  He's Jim Lowe.  You're in the videos with her. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah, and I'm wearing a cape, and we just hate Jimmy Norton.  Of course you do.  And she says, I don't care about the frosted hairdo that I got.  I'm just Helen from the block.  And then I'm raped by whoever really did it in childhood, but I just can't remember.  Jenny pushes you down the stairs and then cuddles you and tells you it's okay?  Yeah, she hugs me and loves me, and we watch Jersey Girl together, and then she shits on my face.  There you go.  All right, well, that's one. 
[02:26:00]  Enchilada on your face.  Very funny.  Keith from Yonkers is asking me if I'm going to rent a Bentley to go up to see Jimmy.  Probably.  If I rent a Mercedes in Beverly Hills.  Of course, I'll get a Bentley.  I was so fucking psyched about the reaction down here for O&A to see WOW shirts in Fort Lauderdale.  It was amazing.  Here's me pulling up to Jimmy's gig.  Hey, Wang, we're late for the show. 
[02:26:30]  That's great.  If it's that close, man, if it's only 20 minutes, I'll pop in.  It's right there.  It's right there, and you should stop by and say hi.  I'm actually in, I think, Southern, I think it's Hollywood, which is like Southern Fort Lauderdale.  Hollywood, which I think is the southern end of Fort Lauderdale.  I'm not that familiar with it, but, I mean, it's close to Miami.  I was surprised.  Cool.  Nice.  My ship leaves on Monday morning, so I've got plenty of time.  Hey, maybe off air, if Ben could give me a password. 
[02:27:00]  I don't remember mine.  I want to listen to the show online because I don't have my Wi-Fi with me.  I fucking forgot it.  So I want to go on and listen to it a while before I go back to bed.  All right.  I'm trying to remember my password.  Okay.  Yeah, we'll figure it out.  Jimmy, the HBO information before we let you go.  Okay.  If you want tickets, the HBO special, it tapes in New York.  It tapes on April 26th, which is a Tuesday night.  There's two shows.  And I fought really hard to get this pre-sale thing up, even though the tickets are free, 
[02:27:30]  for Opie and Anthony fans.  So Jim Norton at BroadwayVideo.com.  That is Jim Norton at BroadwayVideo.com.  Send them an email with your name, and they will give you back information on how to get  tickets.  But these are free tickets, and they're probably going to go quick.  Who else is doing it with you, Jim?  I'm doing the first show with Kevin Brennan.  Oh, cool.  And the late show, I don't know if there's anybody on it.  I'm not sure how they're doing the late show.  It might just be me.  I'm not sure.  We're all going to be there, too.  Oh, yeah.  I want to have a comment.  It's going to be fucking great.  Which means we're going to be really tired the next day, but that will make for some fun 
[02:28:00]  radio, too.  Yeah, you guys are going to be pretty much just going from the venue right into the station,  cranky, and having seen the same dog shit act twice.  All right, I'll talk to you guys this week, and I'll probably see you down here.  And, all right, Bobby, I'll talk to you a little bit when I get back.  Jimmy, I'll talk to you, buddy.  All right, just give me Ben off here.  Yeah, hold on the line.  Bye, boys.  There he goes, Jim Norton.  Richie Rico here from the Poconos says, Ant, the Bentley was a Ben Affleck reference,  you dope.  Excuse me.  I rented a very expensive car in Beverly Hills, and I do believe that's what the guy was 
[02:28:30]  talking about, that I'm going to rent a Bentley to go up to see Jimmy.  Whether it was tied into some other Ben Affleck joke, that would be a peripheral little thing.  The main root of the humor there was the fact that I rent expensive cars when I go out.  Richie Rico.  What's his email address?  No, don't give me the email.  All right, I won't say tooextreme at hotmail.com.  You got it.  T-O-O-X.  You got to calm down a little bit.  T-O-O-X.  You got a little bit of a break, huh?  What?  So you get a couple of emails from our listeners with maybe some big hairy man cock pictures 
[02:29:00]  of that or something.  All right, Anthony, the Pat O'Brien sex tapes.  Yes.  More remixes from the listeners when we get back.  Also, we have another thing we got to talk to Deedee about.  Cricket.  She's sending a demo because she wants to be part of this high voltage channel.  Yes, she does.  I don't think she's high voltage material, though.  She's good for the show, but carry her own program?  Yeah, she'll be part of our show no matter what. 
[02:29:30]  I don't know.  There's something very interesting on her demo tape, though.  You know, we already learned that she likes to black out.  She also got married to some counterfeit dude from England.  There's another great Deedee story that has been unearthed.  Pops up on that?  Yes.  So hopefully we'll get her on the phone today.  Sorry, dude.  Bob Kelly's sitting in for Norton.  Why are you stealing me up?  I didn't, man.  What the hell is wrong with you?  What are you doing, Bob?  He's caressing my fucking arm.  No, I wasn't.  Oh, my God.  What were you doing?  I fight.  Listen.  Listen.  Did you just reach over and start stealing your arm? 
[02:30:00]  Easy.  Don't do that.  No, dude.  I fucking.  You know that.  Oh, shit.  What?  I was sitting here like this, and I accidentally.  You started stroking me like I was a 12-inch C.  His arm was here, and I touched his arm by accident.  And we both ignored it for like a half a second, like looked straight ahead.  Yeah.  But then we both looked at the same time.  It was like the gayest moment of my life.  And On the Wings of Love started playing in the background.  On the Wings of Love.  Why are you touching it?  Why are you that close to it?  I did it.  My hand slipped.  My hand got a little greasy.  But you know what?  What is that? 
[02:30:30]  I touched your arm, and there's like.  It's from my, it's rubbing from my.  Is that going to fucking come on me?  Yeah, it is.  It's a guy.  He's injured from football.  Oh, that's your thing.  All right.  I thought you got a, I touched you, and that happened.  I got a little hip.  Nah.  Not everybody has some STD.  Everybody I know.  I hang out with Patrice, Colin, and Norton.  There's a whole mixture of stuff in there.  Someone actually gets it by being a man and playing football, you know, playing football.  Not having sex with sleazebags.  Without a condom next to your friend.  Let's not be hasty. 
[02:31:00]  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to touch you, man.  I didn't do it on purpose.  It wasn't that bad.  Oh, please.  Let me tell you something.  Don't make me yell, it's getting hot in here.  I know.  Drew, get us out of here.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Go, go, go, go.

[02:50:00]  not really  wait Eric  Eric sent us  down this road  what's going on  with the UPS guy  how would Eric  know about it  I don't even know  Eric  UPS guy  okay  where do I start  this girl has  so many stories  well when I  recently moved  into the place  that I'm moving  out of now  you know  I wasn't in a  relationship  at the time  and my UPS guy 
[02:50:30]  was kind of cute  so for about a month  I was flirting  and invited him  in one morning  for coffee  thinking coffee  tea or me  and you know  ten minutes later  we were going at it  and kind of had  a little fleam  with my UPS dude  wow  did he have  the brown shorts  on and the brown  legs  he had his shorts  he had his shorts  how did you make  the move  you invite him  in for tea  for like a month  I was flirting  with him  like how  whenever he would  bring a package  just talk  you know  for a little bit 
[02:51:00]  you know  just regular  conversation  this is a big  package  I love big  packages  things like that  did you have  like a titty  hanging out of  your nightgown  no  I was just  making small talk  and then one day  I'm like  yeah but did  you know  Bob's on to  something  did you dress  sexy when he  was coming to  the door  no  I was just  always just  casual  were you in a  robe  no  with no panties  did you sign  that big  electronic pad  thing he has  with your mouth  grab the pen  out of his hand  with your mouth  and just  suck the pen  no 
[02:51:30]  did you sign  it I want to  fuck you  no  but I think  he got the clue  though after a while  yeah  of course  I mean  why did he come in  god this girl  is the best  so you invite him  in for tea  and then  for coffee  well yeah coffee  so you're actually  did you have the coffee  yeah I actually  had the coffee  and then how did  you go from  having coffee  and flirting  for a while  to actually  doing it  who made  the actual  move that  sealed the deal  we're just kind of  sitting there  on the couch  and you know  how it just  happens when 
[02:52:00]  it's going to  happen  no someone  had to make  the move  no it never  just happens  and I don't  think UPS  guy made  the first move  because he  probably has  a rule  against that  and god  forbid something  happened  so you had  to do something  what did you do  oh my god  I want to know  who told you  about this  you put your  hand on his leg  well we were  just sitting  there talking  on the couch  a chair  a table  on the couch  on my living  room couch  on the living  room couch  so you're  sitting pretty

[02:53:00]  he's a smart  guy and he  figured it out  when he was  coming in the  door  was it a touch  did he like  a touch to your  neck  did he strangle  you  no I touched  him on the leg  alright so you  did you reached  over and kind  of rubbed his  leg  oh my god  did you see  his mule  harden and kind  of come out  the end of  the shorts  ok  is that  what happened  yeah pretty much  did he like  he grabbed it  and fixed it  so it kind  of was down  the side  and it was  so it could  the tip  could just  the top  of the helmet  could just  slip out  he had a nice  display

Dude, I started my workout program.  You know, I've been working out hard now for about four or five years.  I try to stay in shape my whole life, but I let my body go.  Oh, whatever.  Look at Tyson laughing.  Oh, I know.  He's like, well, I'm not trying to be...  Oh, please.  I'm just trying to stay in shape.  I'm just trying to make sure I don't have baloney tits.  That's my whole goal.  Two-plate guy.  Yeah, exactly.  Plang.  No, but the point I'm making, it's been about four or five years now, maybe even a little 
[03:22:00]  longer.  We went to Club Med on Sam Adams' tab there.  Jim Cook's tab.  Turks and Caicos.  Caicos.  And you just described exactly what happened to Antoni.  He doesn't care anymore, but he was married at the time.  I mean, I brought my chick at the time.  Take her.  Drown her, please.  Right.  And we're going on the day excursions, and the boat is filled with these freaking animals  that just...  Their whole thing is they're hanging out at Club Med banging your chicks when you're 
[03:22:30]  not looking.  And then their catchphrase was, you know, it's all good, man.  It's all good.  You walk in, he's just plowing your girl.  It's all good, man.  Oh, it's all good.  It's down here.  And you see the look.  You see the look that your chick is giving the guys.  Yeah.  There's one guy that speaks English that's friendly, but then there's five other guys  that are just staring at her like they're going to rape her in the fucking bunk downstairs.  And you know, it's all good.  And the look that really bothered me was the look that my chick was giving to all these 
[03:23:00]  guys.  I'm like, you know, maybe it's time to get back in shape when I get back to the States.  They got six packs.  Yeah, these guys, six packs, eight packs.  These guys are ex-Marines, you know, tan all over.  Oh, the scuba diving guy?  Yeah, the scuba diving and the snorkeling guys.  The girls are just drooling.  Exactly.  Everybody, all these guys look like complete idiots.  You go out on the snorkeling boat, and your fins don't fit right.  You can't walk with them.  You've got your lips are all big because there's snorkels in your mouth.  Your mask is making your eyes look all stupid.  You're walking around the deck of the boat, lapping your fins around. 
[03:23:30]  And you're as white as his paper because you just got on vacation.  These guys have been tanning for ten years.  Here comes the tan guy with no snorkel.  He's got the aqualung on his back.  He's like, if you get into trouble, put your fist on top of your head and I'll come to help you.  He puts a knife in his mouth, jumps in the water.  Superhero.  Comes up like fighting a shark.  And you are just the biggest tool, afraid to go, oh, it's cold.  Yeah, you can't even fall into the water, nice.  It's awful.  He does a perfect dive off the bow.  He's got his uncircumcised mule hanging out of his shorts. 
[03:24:00]  Your chicks are jumping off the boat and onto his cock.  Yeah.  And just, oh, yeah, just jump on my penis, ladies.  You fall into the water all awkwardly, and now you're flapping until you're trying to figure it out.  And he jumps in, doesn't make a splash.  He slithers beneath the water.  They really do.  At this point, you have no eye contact with your chick anymore.  Yeah.  She's looking for something better immediately.  You come up, your eyes half shut.  Gasper for air, there's snot.  There's snot coming out of your nose.  I was staying up until 2 or 3 in the morning just knowing that if I fell asleep, my chick was getting banged.  You know, someone of those asses is going to jump off a tree, swing in like an ape, grab her. 
[03:24:30]  He un-dipses his wetsuit, there's a tuxedo under him, he's got a martini.  It was just awful.  There's nothing you can do.  That was what started my workout program when I got back to the States.  I'm like, you know what?  You've got to stay in shape.  There's nothing you can do.  You can do it all the time, man.  And then they have you a credit card.  That's the one thing.  Yeah, give me a credit.  It's like, dude.  You're paying for all this.  You're just, you're like, all right, you can fuck my girl, just don't ruin my credit.  Please.  Take her, get a blowjob.  She does the nuts well, but please don't fuck up my American Express. 
[03:25:00]  I want to get an apartment in five years.  The other gimmick they have there is that fucking trapeze.  There's a trapeze at Club Med, and they're like, oh, try the trapeze, try the trapeze.  They have this French guy that all the girls are drooling over, doing like triple flips,  one hand, his feet, he's grabbing things, he does the perfect fall onto the net below,  and then you're supposed to look like anything on this thing.  You're holding on for life and limb, like your junk is hanging out of your shorts, your nasty sack. 
[03:25:30]  Dude, I got upside down, I had a big beer belly back then, and my gut is in my face.  It's like, oh, come on, now swing over to the next one.  I can't.  Okay, well, fall on the net, but do it in a way that, and you fall, and your arm goes through it,  you're tangled in it, and he's got to help you out while he's fucking your girl.  Yeah, it's awful.  The guy that did it has like 1% body fat, you're like, oh, God.  And they purposely get you in these bad positions to make your body look even worse.  They totally make you look like assholes.  My wife at the time decides then she's going to do skydiving, but it's like tandem skydiving, 
[03:26:00]  so she's strapped to the front of the guy like she's being an asphalt, which she probably is up there on the plane.  So I'm on the beach, and I see the plane way up there, and I see a little dot come out,  and I'm just like, one, one thousand, two, one thousand, three.  Come on, shoot, don't open.  Don't open.  And then it opens, and all you hear is Anthony go, damn it!  He's sobbing.  Damn it. 
[03:26:30]  Well, you swim with the dolphins out there, too.  Wait till you see.  You swim with the dolphins, and these friggin'...  Even the dolphins try to fuck you.  They try to fuck you.  They try to get your girl out there, and as soon as they do it, their tops come off, and their bottoms come off.  They do it to every chick.  You've got to be one with the dolphin, and be naked.  They love it.  They're afraid of swimsuits, ladies, so...  The dolphins will push you through the water, and the guys, they do something,  but as soon as the girls come out, they don't say anything to any of the girls with the tops on,  and the dolphins, as soon as they do it, 50 in the water. 
[03:27:00]  You're coming out like Superman, and all of a sudden, you see this poor mother,  their kids are looking at their mom's saggy tits flapping, her box is hanging out,  it's been unshaven for three months, and these fucking islander assholes are just like,  Yaman, ah!  Leave it to humans, you know, there's some way we can communicate with another species of animal,  and what are we using them for?  Taking chicks' fucking bathing suits off.  Great.  This Turks and Caicos had some scam going, though, man.  We've got to talk about the party boat.  We haven't talked about it in a while.  They take you on the party boat. 
[03:27:30]  It's a day of drinking and beach games, and they take you to, like, this part of, I don't know,  it's like a separate island for this party, and everyone's just getting hammered,  and the whole time, like, what happens at the beach party stays at the beach party.  Stays at the beach party, man.  And they're feeding you sangria and making you, like, take a bat and put it in the sand  and spin around and then run back.  So now you're drunk and dizzy, and you don't know what's going on.  Yeah, so the boyfriends, they're passing out left and right, 
[03:28:00]  and they have no idea the girls are getting fondled by these guys.  Ladies, drink this water for now while your boyfriend drinks whiskey.  Right, right, right.  Yeah, what happens in, you add, that's Vegas with his cops.  So, not on an island where you're raping people, you native savages.  This is where the story gets better.  So then it's a day of drinking and these beach games,  and we all get back on the boat to go back to the main, you know, the mainland or whatever, right?  And it's a good hour ride if the guy is driving a nice speed.  So, the captain, remember? 
[03:28:30]  Oh, the captain.  The drunk guy driving the boat.  The drunk guy driving the boat back.  Give me any kind of credibility by calling him captain.  They all get drunk, and we're starting to make it back to the mainland.  And the guy starts slowing way down, way down.  And Anthony and I are like, what the fuck's going on?  We just want to get back.  Because we're on to the scam, you know, our chicks.  There's a storm coming.  Yeah, our chicks at this point are all, like, giddy, like, from the alcohol.  Like, oh, look at it.  You know, and they're sitting on their laps, because it's okay.  They're so naive.  Women are so naive.  But for some reason, it was okay for our chicks to be on the laps of, like, 
[03:29:00]  these big, black, fucking perfect body guys.  But if we did that with, you know, the female workers there, oh, there'd be hell to pay.  But no, we're just, it's innocent fun.  We're okay, right?  So, Ann and I are watching.  My chick was on this guy's lap and stuff.  And the boat's slowing down.  I swear to God, I'm getting fucking, honest to God, I'm so fucking angry right now.  I want to, if I saw one of these guys, like, punch him, you could do.  You should have said something.  Yeah, there is.  You should have said something.  This guy is 6'4", perfect. 
[03:29:30]  I mean, the guy could just squash you like a, it doesn't.  Or is that called a co-worker?  Trust me.  Trust me, it doesn't matter anymore.  I get aggravated with that shit.  So, we're taking the slow ride back.  And now there's a storm coming.  You see the storm clouds, like, catching up to the boat.  And this guy is just slowing down.  Because he's dry-humping one of these broads as he's driving the boat.  That's why this friggin' tropical thunderstorm is catching up to the boat.  Dude, this is a true story.  Because he's dry-humping.  Dry-humping.  Anthony and I are in the back of the boat.  Pretty much the rest are passed out or barely awake. 
[03:30:00]  And we're watching the guy who's supposed to, you know, safety first.  He's dry-humping as he's driving the boat drunk back to the mainland.  This girl is sloppy drunk.  She's grabbing his hog and stuff, right?  Yeah, I'm getting so fucking annoyed right now.  Dude, true story.  So then, you know, it's a flesh snorkel.  Here, breathe into it.  So, this girl was being like a complete, complete whore all the way back to the mainland.  You fast forward a couple days later, we're back at JFK or whatever.  And she runs into the arms of her boyfriend.  And I'm like, oh, sweetheart. 
[03:30:30]  I wanted to pull this guy aside and go, if you only knew what was going on.  Why didn't you?  Dude, I need those.  Totally blow up.  I would have.  I would have.  That shit, you know what?  This is the one thing about women that, and this makes me just annoyed, how naive they  pretend to be.  They are.  When you go away on vacation, it's like your girl, like, yeah, let's just go walk around  at night.  Listen, you dummy.  Listen, I know you think it's beautiful, but these savages here.  It's a crime-ravaged area that they plopped this resort into, okay? 
[03:31:00]  My money's ten to one here, okay?  One dollar.  They can live for a month and buy a condo.  Are you out of your mind?  I'm not funny.  And then, and then, oh, these son of a bitches, one of those, they came up to us on the beach.  They wanted us to, hey, come to the, we should do that.  We should go.  It'll be fun.  I go, let me tell you something.  I'm not going to a fucking island with a bunch of savages that I don't know, okay?  Okay?  On a boat, their boat, to some island with nobody.  You're out of your mind. 
[03:31:30]  It could be fun.  Find your bodies years later.  You're out of your mind.  Sun-bleached bones and no wallet.  You wake up with no kidney.  You know, that's on eBay.  A friend of mine's girlfriend just got mugged on the train.  She was taking the train home from downtown, Spring Street, at two in the morning, by herself.  She got punched in the face and she got her stuff taken away.  And it's like, that's so, why would somebody do that?  Because it's two in the fucking, it's New York City, you shithead.  Yeah.  You know.  To any normal thinking person, you would say, well, if you saw a hundred dollar bill on the sidewalk, wouldn't you bend over and pick it up? 
[03:32:00]  Right.  That's to us, any normal thinking person.  To some of these animals on the subway, it's the same thing.  They're not looking at a girl trying to get home.  They see money just sitting there on the subway.  Exactly.  For the taking.  Either money or pussy.  Pussy too, yeah.  Oh, if you saw a chick with a leg spread, beautiful girl going, you want to fuck me?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Yeah, exactly.  That's the same thing in the subway.  So what, she's got her clothes on and that horrified look and tears running down her feet. 
[03:32:30]  The same thing.  Again.  We're going to back up slightly.  AJ from Cleveland.  Go ahead, AJ.  Oh, darn it.  Hold on a minute, buddy.  Oh, we got to fix the buttons.  Don't talk.  Start over.  Start over.  Start over.  Start over.  You might have said something really good.  Go ahead.  Hey, you guys, remember the theme.  Along Came Polly, where Ben Steeler caught Hank Azaria, the scuba diving.  That, oh, my God.  That is an accurate scene.  I'm telling you.  We saw it happen all the time when we went to Club Med.  You know what was the most surprising thing of that movie? 
[03:33:00]  Who knew Hank Azaria was like that buff?  The guy like, what the hell?  Is he working out all the time?  It disgusted me.  I was too busy looking at Jennifer Aniston myself, Anthony.  Well, that Hank Azaria.  Let's see.  He was good in that other movie, too.  He was buff when he played Cuban with Robin Williams.  What was that?  Oh, Birdcage.  Birdcage, yeah.  Thank you, AJ.  Remember that movie?  Now you're really getting gay.  I was wearing the bra and the...  That's nice.  The Daisy Dukes.  Nice.  Wig.  Anthony, we got a couple more Pat O'Brien sex tape remixes from the listeners. 
[03:33:30]  Oh, but, um, no, what's his name?  Wait, I think we called up earlier and said we did too many.  Waldo?  Waldo.  Yeah.  Waldo from Philly?  No, we can't do anything.  By the way, that's Dave, by the way.  He's getting us a lot of attention on the internet today.  He was the one that came up with the flash animation.  Yeah.  Dude, you're really talented.  That's good stuff.  Can you give him a mic real fast, Bobby?  Yeah, man.  Let's go, brother.  Dave, do you have anything to plug?  Anything we can do for you?  I got nothing to plug.  I'm just helping you guys out.  Get you some business.  Yeah, it's up on foundrymusic.com and opiananthly.com. 
[03:34:00]  Grab Tyson, Walter.  It was either that or Terry Schiavo soundboard, but that seemed like...  No, this is Terry Schiavo soundboard.  One button.  You just have one big button in the middle.  It's just air.  Basically, a lot of people are trying to find the Pat O'Brien sex tape.  Well, Dave took it, so you got the sex tapes in their entirety with no one messing with it,  and then the flash animation keeps track of all the stuff that Pat O'Brien was saying during the tape.  Yes, Steve?  It's also up on the very front pages of fark.com and newgrounds.com.  That is huge for the show.  Those sites are massive. 
[03:34:30]  Massive.  It's not exactly radio-friendly, but it works.  It's not exactly radio-friendly, but it works.  It's satellite radio-friendly.  That's why we like being here.  Very web-friendly.  And Travis posted it to about a dozen other really high-traffic sites.  So we're going to get some...  It's way out there.  People are going to get this in their personal email boxes for the next couple weeks.  While I'm thinking about it, real quick, because I know we're going on vacation very soon.  This is hot.  As Carson Reed's rent voice.  I looked over.  I want to thank all the listeners that actually subscribed to it before we leave, 
[03:35:00]  because this is pretty much our last live show before we get taken off the premium channel.  But everybody that really came on board and backed the show and subscribed early  and really supported the show when it cost you two bucks a month to do it.  Yeah, you guys were really stupid, actually.  Because you're stupid and everything.  All you have to do is start listening today,  because now for the next two weeks we're just playing the best stuff we did.  Yeah.  Not all the crappy shows and all the yelling and screaming.  It's just going to be the top-notch stuff. 
[03:35:30]  Top-notch.  April 2nd, it comes off the premium, and, you know, everybody can get it.  But you guys, you know, hold a special place in our hearts like our little retarded child.  At this point, shouldn't they be rolling in a cake or something?  Yeah, really.  That's it.  But, no, you guys, you know, helped us out there.  They know how much we care about them.  I don't care about them.  I'm just saying thanks.  No.  I don't give a shit about these mutants.  Pestering asses.  You can put the book down now, dude.  I know.  You're reading that a little too long. 
[03:36:00]  You're supposed to read a paragraph and laugh and throw it at me.  Not read the thing like you're on the train going to work.  I have just taken my helmet and shoulder pads off.  It's just fun.  It's just fun.  Reminds me of the locker room.  Good times.  Oh, hey.  A little towel snapping going on there.  The rep from Nike came in again.  Anthony, here we go.  Another remix from one of our fans.  I think this is Scott's.  Sunday, 7, 0, 9, PM.  Aye, aye, man. 
[03:36:30]  You're so fucking hot.  Oh, yeah.  You're so fucking hot.  You suck your pussy.  You're so fucking hot.  You and fuck you and suck your tits.  You're so fucking hot. 
[03:37:00]  I don't know what's wrong with me. 
[03:37:30]  I don't do this.  Yeah, a little busy.  That whole thing is so disturbing.  That thing really is disturbing.  Yeah, it's on the verge of an orgasm or just a cow getting shot.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Well, we'll leave on an up door.  Roman War Helmet.  What?  From rockbag.com. 
[03:38:00]  We can't leave with that one.  No, no.  That's the last one we play.  No.  Oh, man.  It's okay with me.  I'm still fucking with you.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  That's fucking how it's facts.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Oh, I've got this feeling.  I suck my cock.  So up eating for us to get together and sing, sing.  If you get this, that's just look at me and say yes.  All right.  That's cute.  I love that song.  That potential.  Very good. 
[03:38:30]  Got to love the listeners.  Ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping.  How does that just jab in your head and not leave?  Dude, that's my favorite part.  That ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping.  Banana phone.  Hey, let's say hi to Ozzy.  We had him on this week.  He wants to say something.  Ozzy.  Hi, guys.  How are you guys?  Pretty good, Ozzy.  Thanks for coming in on Monday.  Oh, absolutely.  I was in the city going to meet with MTV because of the new season.  I was born in my box set. 
[03:39:00]  But I plan on being back in a few weeks.  Maybe I'll say hi again.  But I just want to let you guys know before you guys go on vacation, I've done hundreds  of radio shows.  I've never had so much fun as when I did you guys' radio show.  You guys really doing something unique, you know?  I appreciate it.  Did you enjoy meeting Jim Norton?  He's your biggest fan, you know?  Oh, absolutely.  Jimmy's a very nice guy, and he's a very, very respectful guy, and I was happy to meet 
[03:39:30]  him, you know?  All right.  Well, thanks, Ozzy.  No problem.  How are you doing, Ozzy?  This is Bob.  I just want to let you know you're the first concert I ever went to.  Oh, I appreciate that, Bob.  Boston Garden.  I smoked pot for the first time.  That was the first time I ever had a suicide thought.  I swear to God.  Something came over me.  I was just going to jump off the balcony in the Boston Garden.  Really?  And hopefully land on the stage, which probably wouldn't happen. 
[03:40:00]  I'd probably just land off to the side and you'd keep going with the show.  I hope it didn't have anything to do with my performance that night.  No, no, no.  I was just 10 and I smoked weed for the first time.  And I was at an Ozzy concert.  That was back in the day when you went to a concert and everybody was like, you know,  mesk weed, mesk weed, weed, mesk acid.  But now it's like, you know, Coke, pizza.  I'm glad you enjoyed yourself, you know.  Yeah.  And again, guys, I hope you guys have a great vacation.  He's blowing you off.  I just want to talk to you guys soon. 
[03:40:30]  I'm actually taking a helicopter at JFK, so I get all playing back to Los Angeles.  All right.  Well, thank you, Ozzy.  We'll talk to you again soon, okay?  No problem, guys.  All right.  There he goes, Ozzy, everybody.  Take care.  It says helicopter.  Helicopter.  Someone wants to wish Tyson good luck.  Wayne, Rhode Island.  What's up?  Hey, Tyson.  Yeah.  I wanted to let you know, man, you should be asking for a trade.  With Drew Bledsoe on your team, man, you guys don't stand a chance in hell.  Well.  Oh, Jesus.  I think it's well worth it to judge. 
[03:41:00]  I'm from Boston, and I tell you what, he sucked.  He always throws to the other team.  You guys got no chance.  Holy shit.  The chant is going to be, hey, he's better than Vinny.  Yeah.  I'm from Boston, too.  Why don't you come down here and say that to his face?  Yeah.  How does that sound?  We're running out of show, so, yeah, we want to thank everyone for listening.  I guess when we get back from vacation, the first live show we'll do is from Bill's Bar  in Boston on Lansdowne Street.  Opening day, Yankees, Sox, and we're going to change the show time, 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.  on the East Coast, hoping a lot of people show up. 
[03:41:30]  It's going to be a very, very fun live show because we're all going to be well-rested.  And then the second day, we're doing something at the Paradise.  All the info is up on the websites, okay?  Aw.  Don't you hate when a good date gets broken up by an Amber Alert?  Hate that.  Speak for your soul.  Isn't there an Amber Alert last week and her name was actually Amber?  That's confusing, isn't it?  Bob, anything you want to promote?  Yeah.  RobertKelleyLive.com.  Go to my website, get my CDs up there, and I'm doing Torgasm the whole month of April. 
[03:42:00]  Very good.  So it should be, hopefully, a fun time.  I'll be calling in.  Very funny.  Good job today.  Aw, thanks, guys.  Pleasure having you.  Drew Boogie?  Sirs, if this isn't a show that doesn't say that this show is much better than any other show in the world,  I don't know what would, you know what I'm saying?  I don't know what that statement just meant.  I have no idea what I'm trying to say.  I got to agree with it.  I completely choked.  You guys are more gooder than anybody else on the radio. 
[03:42:30]  That's what that means.  Right there.  Hey, man, all right.  I want to thank Eric and Derek and Danny and Nathaniel and Travis, of course, Ben and Martini Steve.  They work really hard behind the scenes, and we give them a lot of shit.  And they just have done a great job so far for us.  Thank you, guys.  Have fun helping.  And, of course, Masterpuff.  I'll call you from the ship.  You will?  Yeah, I got my satellite phone with me.  I'm going to be bringing my MiFi to see how the worst of sound.  I will, too.  See you later.  See you later.  See you later. 
[03:43:00]  Program complete. </pre>
