<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with technical difficulties involving one host's microphone before transitioning to a discussion about a potential Liberty Media takeover of Sirius XM, imagining the CEOs in Star Wars costumes for a humorous newspaper article.  The hosts then launched into a scathing critique of the Sirius XM bathroom facilities, detailing their appalling state of filth and unsanitary conditions.  This was followed by mockery of Mayor Michael Bloomberg's soda ban juxtaposed with his celebration of National Donut Day, with audio clips highlighting Bloomberg's justifications.  The show then analyzed a video of George W. Bush at his White House portrait unveiling, focusing on his nervous demeanor.  The segment concluded with a humorous ranking of US presidents by their comedic value, also including a mention of one host's former girlfriend, Mimi Beardsley.

The next segment opened with speculation about the location and condition of a wheelchair-bound attendee (possibly George H.W. Bush) at the presidential portrait unveiling, which also featured Bill and Hillary Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama.  The hosts reminisced about a previous shoe-throwing incident at a presidential event.  Chris Hemsworth then joined the show as a guest.  The hosts heavily commented on his attractiveness, and the conversation extended to a humorous discussion of superhero sexuality, particularly Green Lantern.  Hemsworth's interview covered his early acting career in Australian soap operas, contrasting them with Hollywood productions, and his experiences working with Kristen Stewart and Charlize Theron. He also discussed the challenges of acting. The segment concluded with a sexually explicit song, further discussion of Hemsworth, his family (including his brother's role in *The Hunger Games*), and the hosts’ personal lives, including Anthony's upcoming wedding and jokes about Sam Roberts' impending nuptials.

The following segment heavily focused on Sam Roberts' wedding, anticipating and expressing anxieties about the potential for disruptive behavior from Eastside Dave.  There was much speculation about Dave’s likely antics and bets placed on his behavior.  Anthony's reluctance to attend was a prominent topic. Sam discussed logistical arrangements, including a limo.  The conversation touched upon a recent New York court ruling on the non-slanderous nature of labeling someone gay.  The hosts also discussed a picture Sam took with Chris Hemsworth and plans to alter it with Instagram filters. Saad Moussini, introduced by Jonathan, joined the show. His career as a media mogul in Afghanistan, including work on Afghan television and broadcasting American shows to Iran, was briefly discussed. The segment ended with wedding-related banter and Anthony's anticipation for the post-ceremony festivities.

A subsequent segment delved deeper into Saad Moussini’s work in Afghanistan and Iran.  Saad discussed the similarities between Afghan and Western radio formats, his interactions with the Taliban, and his media ventures in Iran, including the broadcasting of dubbed telenovelas. He commented on the US raid that killed Osama bin Laden and the complexities of US involvement in Afghanistan and Pakistan.  The conversation covered Saad's personal life, including his wedding, and cultural perspectives on marriage and divorce in Afghanistan.  They compared situations in North Korea and Brazil,  and Saad shared travel experiences involving danger and violence. He mentioned a short film he was in featuring Devin Ratray and Adrian Grenier.

The next segment continued the discussion of the complexities of the Middle East, focusing on Afghanistan and Pakistan, with Saad providing insights into tribal warfare, corruption, and outside funding of terrorist organizations.  The hosts and Saad discussed US foreign policy challenges, Iranian and Pakistani stability, and potential Israeli action against Iran.  The conversation shifted to Sam Roberts' wedding, with joking about plans to disrupt it, mentioning wearing white spandex, taking Cialis, and possibly having masked men dunk the groom.  They mentioned an anti-social comedy tour.  A listener call-in segment followed, with further wedding-related banter, intern grading, and discussions on Mayor Bloomberg's soda ban.

The final excerpt featured a conflict between Rich Davis and the main host, stemming from Davis revealing the name of someone who spoke negatively about the host. The identity remained undisclosed. The conversation shifted to the host's upcoming wedding and sex life with their fiancé, including details about a stained couch and past sexual partners.  A graphic description of oral sex and semen swallowing followed, sparked by a story involving a male guest (Troy) and an adult film star.  The conversation explored the female guest's (Nicole) sexual experiences, including frank discussions of oral sex, mutual masturbation, and tasting vaginal fluids. The show concluded with final comments, social media plugs, and a transition to the Ron and Fez show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hey, yo, what's up out there?  Nice kill.  That is not good.  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  If you sound a fun, this is offensive.  Just don't listen.  But my guess is, you'll be sticking around.  Let's do it.  It's going down, Jack.  Hey, it's Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony Show  right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:00:30]  This is good radio right here.  Y'all are cooler and shit.  It starts funny and it gets very uncomfortable.  One of the most popular shows in the world.  Radio journalism at its best.  Hello, kids.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  They swear and they're vulgar and they talk about awful, awful things.  That's what you like, isn't it?  I'm Opie.  The show is twisted.  I'm telling you, who's enjoying this shit?  That's what you like, isn't it?  Anthem.  I want dick prizes.  I love when girls go through that.  I'm here for you, ladies.  Remember that.  That's what you like, isn't it?  And Jim Norton.  If a pussy could talk, it would say, die. 
[00:01:00]  That's what you like, isn't it?  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Good morning.  Welcome aboard.  Not enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  I got the Friday morning.  Friday morning.  Friday morning.  Hola.  The hell, oops.  That'll hurt.  Well, let's broadcast.  All right.  Let's do this. 
[00:02:00]  Oh, I missed the broads.  What happened to the broads?  Broads.  Hey, my mic's fucked up today.  No?  That's fucked up.  A little phasing thing happening.  Ah.  That's good.  There we go.  Hi, everybody.  How's everyone doing?  I just said I'm not doing good.  My mic's all fucked up.  I was talking to the audience.  Hello.  In radio land, as they say.  It's fazey.  Is it fazey?  I feel my voice is going like this. 
[00:02:30]  Oh.  Oh.  From right to left real fast in my headphones.  Oh.  Fart.  Fart.  Fart.  Fart.  Fart.  Fart.  Fart.  Fart.  Fart.  Fart.  Fart.  Fart.  Fart.  Fart.  Fart.  Fart.  Fart.  Fart.  Fart.  Fart.  Fart.  Fart.  Fart.  Fart.  It's just slowly lumbering down the hallway.  The only reason you're here is in case you have to tweak something.  Can you tweak this, please?  Ah.  Tweak and then do whatever the fuck you do.  Then you can have your siesta.  It's mass.  There's a faze thing happening here.  Faze.  Oh.  What?  No one else hears it. 
[00:03:00]  Whoa.  Oh, man.  No one else hears it.  It's like, no one else hears it.  Uh-oh.  In other words, I guess your ears is fucked up, yo.  All right.  Huh?  Your headphone jack, perhaps.  I don't know.  Headphone jack.  Jack.  Did you jiggle it?  Just figured out.  Did you wiggle it just a little bit?  Yeah.  I'm going to put the good word in that Liberty Media for you, Mars.  Oh.  Okay, thank you.  I'm going to put the good word in for you.  Oh.  I wonder what kind of purge will happen when that happens. 
[00:03:30]  When Liberty takes over.  I guess there's going to be a takeover.  Is that what the people are saying?  I don't know.  I don't know shit anymore.  I used to know shit.  It's funny.  Mel called me yesterday, and I didn't call him back.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  He's like, I got a question for you.  I need some advice.  When you get back, I'm like, I was busy.  Big article in the paper today.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Well, it's saying.  Liberty Media wants this company.  Is it speculation, or is it things that are actually happening?  Liberty takeover of Sirius could cost him CEO job, it says. 
[00:04:00]  This is the post.  Ah, the post is full of lies, though.  It says John Malone of Liberty Media is pulling out all the stops.  Oh, it's only a bid to take over Sirius XM, which is run by Mel Karmazin, the Gotham-based  media boss.  Oh.  And they are both dressed up.  Mel's dressed like Star Wars people.  Yeah.  Why do they have them dressed like Star Wars people?  And they have the guy from Liberty with a lightsaber.  How'd they get them in the studio to get them to dress up? 
[00:04:30]  I don't know.  I don't know.  It's amazing.  That's why you can't really take that paper seriously.  They're dressing up two CEO titans, media titans in Star Wars gear.  Yeah.  For an article on a takeover.  Dopes.  And I don't know.  Mel looks like he's part of the rebellion.  Is he?  And then, yeah, the Liberty guy looks like he's part of the Empire.  And he's got a lightsaber.  Mel's got a blaster.  So he's more of a hard solo guy.  Yeah. 
[00:05:00]  You ever see Star Wars?  Which one's better?  Lightsaber or blaster?  Han Solo.  Which one's better?  I'll go with a blaster anytime.  I'm more Han Solo-ish.  All right.  Then we're good.  I've seen a lot of things, but I've never seen no force.  There's a spin-off situation here, I think.  No energy.  Merge, spin-off, and then new board.  Uh-oh.  I don't even know what that means. 
[00:05:30]  It's probably friggin', who knows?  Do you think anything will trickle down and change at this level?  Well, I mean, the basics.  Liberty loaned some money to save the company back in, what, 2008, 2009?  Now what, they're coming to collect?  Yes, they are.  They're coming to collect.  That's exactly what's happening.  Where they're going to bust some legs.  They're coming to collect.  Yep.  The company was kind of dead in the water.  Didn't they pull them out a day before?  It was dead in the water.  Dude, a day before.  Liberty came and rescued them. 
[00:06:00]  And now Liberty is coming for some...  Liberty.  For some what?  Uh, payback.  Some payback.  Let's call it payback.  Some interest.  The VIG.  I think Liberty is going to take control.  It's just a matter of how it's done.  Yeah.  I think what is going on here.  What, do they got to get more than a 50% stake in the company?  Rumor has it they're close to 46.  46.  Stakes back there?  I'm starving.  46.  I got about 4% of the company, so maybe Liberty should talk to me. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, I think they got to scrape up some shares.  I might have a few.  Find some.  I might have a few if they need them.  Yeah.  But, uh, yeah.  Who knows?  We've been through this shit so many times, it doesn't even matter.  And then Liberty, they're not like a broadcast company.  No, they would...  They buy companies, and then they, uh, they do like what people do with houses.  They buy a fixer-upper.  Yep.  And they fixer-upper it, and then they off it.  They might spin it off.  For a profit.  They might.  So...  They're trying to save on taxes, too.  Yeah.  Like $2 billion worth of taxes. 
[00:07:00]  So this will just be some tax shelter?  They have to do it in such a way where...  They're trying to do it in such a way where they save a lot of money on taxes.  Really?  Yeah, that's the ABCs, without getting too complicated with the whole thing.  Ah.  Yeah, they're trying to save about $2 billion.  $2 billion.  This company makes a lot of money.  Unfortunately, none of us really get to see it.  It doesn't really trickle down.  Who gets to see this money that's going around?  Upstairs.  Yeah?  You point up...  You just point up.  Yeah.  Apparently, there's people on the floor above us that run this whole show. 
[00:07:30]  Well, I'll tell you one thing.  They know how to treat their bathroom upstairs.  Good bathroom?  Anyone go to the bathroom this morning?  Oh.  What are they...  What a...  Is there monkeys?  And I mean literally monkeys that broadcast after we leave here?  You gotta see what the bathroom looks like this morning.  Oh, is it a wreck?  Out of five stalls, I literally couldn't find one that I could even scrub the dry urine off  so I could sit down and take a shit. 
[00:08:00]  I don't understand.  I mean, where do we work?  I swear to you, the Port Authority bathrooms, and if you know anything about New York, Port  Authority is a scary fucking place.  I guarantee their bathrooms are better than this place.  The fuck goes on?  And much better for jobs.  There was one stall that was a huge nest that someone built, and then another one that had  wet paper towels on the side because someone was trying to scrub the dry urine off the  fucking seat.  I don't understand.  And then every single toilet was not flushed.  So people were dumping on top of fucking other people's dumps. 
[00:08:30]  Who the fuck is doing this?  I don't know.  Animals.  It's something that happens after hours around here.  But you go upstairs, you know, it's like the real corporate people.  Oh, yeah.  Their bathrooms are nice because none of these fucking animals, you know, would be brave enough  to do that shit upstairs.  Flush like a jet engine.  Flush!  One thing corporate people like is to shit in a clean environment.  Dude, it's pristine up there.  But you don't want to walk up the stairs to get there.  How could people not flush, not fucking, they're pissing all over the place, and the 
[00:09:00]  ones that take fucking huge dumps and just, like, leave the shit there.  If you're doing it as a joke, it's funny.  But I know they're not.  No, it's people.  They're just animals.  It's people that just don't know how to, you know, work with others properly and don't  give a fuck.  So they pull out their giant penis and pee on everything.  That's another one.  They're fucking, like, got chemo going on on their fucking pubes.  Right.  They're just falling all over the toilet seat.  There's pubes.  There's pubes.  There's some thick pubes. 
[00:09:30]  I don't know if there was something going on last night where maybe guests were here  or something, but it's worse than usual.  Oh, there's pubes.  There's giant droplets of urine that are dried on thick.  The fuck do you eat that?  No, I don't sock that shit.  I sock for one drop, two drops, my stuff.  No one else's stuff.  I'm not scrubbing.  I'm not scrubbing.  Scrub it.  The Sirius XM toilet seat with my sock.  Are you crazy?  That's where I'm not crazy. 
[00:10:00]  A couple of my own droplets at home.  Yeah, sure.  I'll use my sock.  But you need a spatula to scrape some of the shit out.  You should go see it.  No, I fucking, I'm disgusted.  It's infuriating.  God, flush the fucking toilet, you pigs.  There's toilet paper all over the place.  One guy was brave enough.  One guy was in a stall.  I don't know.  Maybe he found the one stall.  Yeah, magic one.  But I kicked open four doors and four for four.  I could not.  And I swear to you, I'll sit down on some shit, man. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, God.  I really will.  I'll sit down on some fucking toilet seats.  I don't give a fuck.  But these seats with that, I can't get over the dried urine.  It was raised up.  Yeah.  No, they have somebody that cleans.  Someone that's going to hear, they have someone that cleans at night.  No, they have somebody that cleans today.  Today.  They'll clean.  But how the fuck overnight could it get that bad?  Like, people don't.  They're pigs.  Well, the other thing is, yesterday, the guy who cleans, he has to lock the door from the inside.  So I don't know if he's dealing drugs or something. 
[00:11:00]  And we have to rush.  When we go to break, we rush down to the bathroom.  Yeah.  They're on the other side of the floor.  Yeah.  And a lot, not a lot, but enough times that the door's locked.  Door's locked.  And then you've got to go find another bathroom upstairs, you know, the corporate bathroom upstairs.  And they don't want that.  They don't want the pigs going up there to fucking use their clean bathroom.  No.  So, you should check it out, though.  God damn.  Fucking Bloomberg's getting killed.  I love it.  I love it.  Oh, the press is really eating him up about this sugary drinks. 
[00:11:30]  Did you hear what he's doing today?  Yeah.  He's celebrating National Donut Day.  Donut Day.  He is the dopiest mayor in the country.  After all that bullshit about the sodas and the quantity of sodas that you're allowed to buy in New York.  Now.  Yeah.  And then he's doing Donut Day.  Yeah.  He's doing Donut Day today.  But he's telling people, because everyone's calling him out on it.  Of course.  He's like, oh, it's just a fun little thing.  Yeah.  But isn't that giving the wrong message by celebrating the donut? 
[00:12:00]  You stupid fuck.  Donut's make you obese, right?  I have no respect for politicians.  I have no respect for mayors whatsoever.  None.  Bloomberg's an idiot.  None.  He really is a jackass.  And Jon Stewart pointed out how Times Square is just filled with shitty, I'm using the word shitty, shitty restaurants that are not good for you.  We have an M&M store in Times Square.  Yeah.  That sells nothing but M&M's. 
[00:12:30]  But fucking giant.  You could buy the biggest fucking satchel of M&M's.  Right.  That you'll ever see.  And then you could go to these, you know, these franchise restaurants.  Right.  There's not, I've tried to eat in some of those places.  I do try to eat healthy.  And you go there every once in a while with, you know, visitors or people that want to just, you know, eat there, whatever.  Fine.  And I can't find anything on the menu that's under 28,000 calories.  It's amazing.  The Fridays, the Olive Garden, they're all in Times Square and they all just serve fat fucking food. 
[00:13:00]  Right.  And, you know, I believe those companies paid a shitload of money to be in Times Square.  Yeah.  Mayor Bloomberg.  It's a matter, mayor.  But now you can have your 28,000 calorie dinner, but you're going to have to do it with a smaller soda.  Yeah.  This is insanity.  This is complete insanity what goes on.  He just gets these ideas and really follows through with them.  Yeah.  These shitty ideas.  What is he saying about Donut Day?  Oh, I got it right in front of me. 
[00:13:30]  He's literally going to be in front of, like, a giant donut or something.  A giant donut.  And he's going to take a bite.  Worried about the soda ban?  Fear not.  Bloomberg to support National Donut Day today.  You're a clown.  And Iraq came in today?  I thought it was a day off.  But wouldn't you think if you're doing this with the soda and you're the mayor, you might look at your schedule and go, oh, fuck, seriously?  National Donut Day?  So wouldn't you do the soda thing maybe after the Donut Day or maybe you would send someone else to Donut Day and just avoid this controversy? 
[00:14:00]  He's got to go down there and deep throat a cruller.  Right.  Fucking queen.  Yeah, Mr. Mayor, you're not supposed to sit on that.  It's a cruller.  It's an eclair.  Oh, yeah.  He prefers the eclairs.  The eclair.  He sucks all the cream out of them.  Fruit.  You think this fucking guy's out of touch?  Oh, God, yeah.  He's got to be out of touch to think that this is not a problem with his soda ban thing.  Bloomberg Press Conference efforts to stop the sale of large soft drinks at restaurants. 
[00:14:30]  One reporter in attendance brought up the interesting fact that his administration also supports National Donut Day today  and inquired as to whether that muddled the mayor's message on the issue.  Indeed.  So at 930 in the morning, Entenmann's.  Let's go get some Entenmann's.  Oh, my God.  Every time we mention Entenmann's, someone has to run out and get some.  Original, please.  They're so good.  Can't do it.  Wow.  Oh, man.  Look at Jimmy.  Whoa. 
[00:15:00]  Jimmy's got some guns on him.  Double guns.  Jimmy hit the bag for five minutes yesterday.  Yeah.  Well, so to speak.  Again, with the bridge of his nose.  Right.  The ball bag joke.  I think you got it.  Oh, he's unveiling the custom-made Entenmann's large donuts, one foot in diameter.  So it's a new product.  This is our mayor.  He's the biggest idiot on the planet.  So a giant donut.  The day after he wants to ban large sugary drinks, he's going to be at a press conference 
[00:15:30]  where they unveil the giant donut, the large donuts, one foot in diameter, at Madison Square  Park at the same time.  Holy fuck.  Do you think the press is going to ask him about this whole thing?  They won't even catch the connection.  They won't even catch it.  No.  No.  I can't wait to see that.  Oh, they're going to kill him.  He's going to have one of those proclamation letters.  Oh, God.  One of those corny fucking mayor things that they do.  Yeah.  Hand out the dumb key to the city.  Yeah.  I've never seen that door.  Where is it?  The work of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene reflects the mayor's public health 
[00:16:00]  agenda.  The message is that we will do what we need in our official capacity to protect the health  of New Yorkers.  All right.  Then get rid of all those franchise restaurants in Times Square.  Start there.  Those places are fucking packed.  It's hard to get a table in there.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  And then he's going to fucking be doing the donut thing.  We got clips of Bloomberg on TV.  You want to hear it?  Of course.  The donut thing.  I don't get it, though.  One foot wide donut.  Why wouldn't he wait a couple of weeks with the sugary soda thing? 
[00:16:30]  Because he's a dope.  Yeah, he's a dope.  Because people would forget about the donut thing.  He doesn't care.  He's so self-obsessed.  He can't even imagine that people would think he's wrong or doing something maybe that  looks stupid.  Who's putting the donut thing together?  Is it Roger?  I know.  The giant donut.  Is Roger part of this?  And window clings.  And Gary Hoey.  Or is he too busy stealing shit from museums?  Holy fuck.  Are you serious?  Roger. 
[00:17:00]  Give me half that shit you stole, Roger.  Man.  Wow.  Satellite TV units and stuff off the walls.  Well.  Gold records.  You know, usually we go, allegedly.  But I saw him personally take shit off the walls.  I know.  That was the days of NAW when the change was happening.  And there was some fucking...  It was better than the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Some of the shit hanging in those hallways.  Yeah.  And we came to work one day and it was all gone.  They even had a Nirvana thing signed by everybody. 
[00:17:30]  A gold record.  That's gone.  Zeppelin lithographs, right?  Yeah.  On the walls signed by fucking Plan and Page and everybody else.  And man, people went to town.  Roger.  Roger.  Roger.  Who suggested we broadcast in front of the world's largest Pop-Tart.  Pop-Tart.  In Madison Square Garden.  It was going to be a big Pop-Tart.  And he was all excited that we were going to be able to set up a broadcast right next to it.  Didn't he want us to marry a couple in a limo or something on the way to AC?  There's another one.  I forgot.  What was that one? 
[00:18:00]  Goddamn.  Yes.  It was going to...  There was going to be a wedding in a limo.  Was it in a limo?  And we were going to be there as witnesses and we were going to drive down to Atlantic City in the limo.  You sure that's what it was?  Something like that, right?  Yeah.  It was definitely something like that.  Oh, God.  Oh, he sucked.  And then it turned out the giant Pop-Tart wasn't even one Pop-Tart.  It was a bunch of Pop-Tarts put together into a giant Pop-Tart.  Oh, that's lazy.  How cheesy is that?  That's lazy.  I'm not going to broadcast next to that.  Here's Bloomberg on the large sugary drinks. 
[00:18:30]  This guy's a dope.  New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has touched off a nationwide controversy with his efforts to combat obesity.  Bloomberg is proposing to ban any sugary drinks larger than 16 ounces from restaurants, movie theaters, food carts, and concession stands.  Diet drinks and fruit juice...  We've got to stop this because this is what politicians do.  All right, obviously there's an obesity problem in this country, right?  Sure.  But if you go to a movie, the shit they offer you is horrendous. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  So Bloomberg will just blow off all that because that's too complicated.  Oh, let's just try to make the soda smaller.  It's not accomplishing anything.  When you get those nachos with that fake cheese spilt on top of it...  Holy fuck, you get personal pan pizzas and all...  You know the candy they have there.  Or how about you give good tax breaks to healthier foods?  Like in the airport, you want to eat healthy on the road.  I travel all the time.  I can't.  It's hard, right?  It's impossible.  So how about you give fucking tax breaks to places because the money they're going to save you eventually by not making us a bunch of fat fucks. 
[00:19:30]  How about you do that to salad places, which are really good,  so it makes it financially viable for them to open up.  And that's how you combat it.  Right.  You don't fucking ban anything.  You can't ban things.  Right.  But you heard that.  As soon as I heard movie theater, I'm like, are you kidding me?  Sometimes I go to a movie and I'm starving.  I'm like, what am I going to eat?  Because I don't want to eat like that.  Even the popcorn is better.  Even the popcorn is already pre-buttered and pre-salted.  Crazy.  They just put more stuff on.  Yeah.  If you want. 
[00:20:00]  Butter.  I don't know what that is.  Why doesn't he go after all that?  You know why?  Because that's a lot of fucking money coming in.  That's craziness.  This would be exempt.  And joining me now is the mayor.  Mr. Mayor, explain how you think this would work  and counteract the criticism that this is the nanny state run amok.  Well, the way it would work is simply those organizations,  those industries that we regulate,  which are restaurants and movie theaters and carts,  they can still sell 32 ounces of sugar drink to you, 
[00:20:30]  but they'd have to put it in two containers.  And the idea here is you tend to eat all the food in the container in front of you.  If it's a bigger container, you'll eat more.  If somebody put a smaller glass or plate or bowl in front of you, you would eat less.  And at this point, there's an epidemic in this country of people being overweight,  bordering on obesity.  The number of percentage of the population that's obese is skyrocketing.  In New York City alone, the number of deaths from smoking has declined so much 
[00:21:00]  and the number of deaths from obesity has gone up so much.  Those two are about to cross.  We're going to have more deaths from obesity than from smoking.  People are quitting smoking, you dope.  That's because people are quitting smoking and they're overeating.  You won't let them smoke anywhere.  So they shove food in their fucking face.  They're dying to do something.  Exactly.  They're getting fatter and you're saying they can't do it.  What's next?  This interviewer is horrible.  She's got to challenge them on all this stuff.  Yeah, we all know there's a problem out there,  but this is not going to take care of the problem. 
[00:21:30]  People are just going to buy two sodas.  They're just going to buy two sodas.  By the way, the fuck...  Iraq.  Oh, go ahead.  There's donuts outside that Fox.  That's why I was pointing next door.  There's a whole bunch of donuts they're giving out.  So why don't we go get some, he's right next door.  E-Rod, you like your sugary drinks.  I'm not even going for a joke.  Are you going to now drink less soda because you can't get, let's say, a 32 ounce, right?  It's got to go down to 16 ounces.  16 ounces.  Or are you going to find another way to get more? 
[00:22:00]  No, because I live in New Jersey.  It doesn't affect me.  You fucking work in New York, you cunt.  Oh, I see.  You're the worst.  Good answer.  That's a great answer considering half your day is spent in New York City.  You're just a dope.  And I was trying to go with a real thing instead of make fun of the kid.  It's not going to stop me.  You're just dumb.  Involve him in the discussion and what do you do?  I was...  Whatever.  I live in Jersey.  Maybe.  How many meals do you have in New York every day? 
[00:22:30]  Breakfast and lunch.  And lunch.  Lunch.  So two out of your three meals you're doing in New York.  But you live in Jersey.  Hey, why would you think it would affect you?  Jeez.  Poor sweet kid.  Poor sweet kid.  No, you weren't kidding.  Then he tries to spin it.  That's E-Rock's favorite excuse.  I've been doing radio since I was 18.  I know when someone's kidding and not.  You were trying to get out of a dumb fucking comment.  Oh, boy.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit, E-Rock.  I love you.  Oh.  I do.  Still his hero?  I just get frustrated.  I love you.  That's life-size, isn't it? 
[00:23:00]  What?  Bush's picture is life-size.  Yeah, look at that.  Bush was killing it yesterday.  He was...  Can we get that audio?  ...hilarious at this fucking unveiling of a photo.  Yeah, his big portrait.  His big White House portrait is ready, and they're hanging that up, and the ex-first lady there.  And I don't know.  He was talking.  He was killing.  But he kept doing this ding with his jaw after he would blurt out one of his very funny lines,  and it looked like Coke Mouth.  Yeah.  It looked like he was doing that grind-the-teeth thing after you talk, and he's sweating like 
[00:23:30]  crazy.  It's been too long.  I don't remember what Coke Mouth is.  Back on the blow.  I don't remember.  He's back on the blow.  And just grinding his teeth away.  Yeah, he's running around.  He's walking around in his underwear, sweating, going, all right, all we gotta do is, we gotta,  we gotta set up Afghanistan, and then we gotta go over, we gotta fix Iran.  He's just blathering fucking half-naked in his house.  I love this, motor-in.  What's your car?  Little Asian boy setting off fire. 
[00:24:00]  Motor-in.  Motor-in.  I was a guy that didn't, I was a guy that didn't really like Bush, I'll be honest.  But since he's left office, I kinda like the guy.  People love presidents in hindsight.  I kinda like the guy.  Is that bad?  No, he was a funny guy.  Not in office, though.  He was a bit stiff in office.  Yeah.  But now he's like, he's loose.  You don't give a shit, it's nice to see.  Ricky Springfield, buddy of mine.  I love that.  Wish that I had Jesse's girl. 
[00:24:30]  Fucking boogie nights, man.  This is so good.  I haven't seen this scene in a long time.  Right?  Yeah, yeah, Doc Ock.  Oh, it's so good.  In a robe.  Alfred Molina.  That's it, yeah.  Yeah.  He's fucking great.  What a great character.  And he wasn't in the movie all that long or anything, but really stood out. 
[00:25:00]  He absolutely did.  And they're all fucking sitting, they're all wired and jumping at every firecrack.  It was such a stressful fucking scene.  It was an amazing scene.  Oh, I loved it.  And that movie was supposed to be a goof, right?  No.  Nah, that was pretty...  When it first came out, I mean...  No, I think Burt Reynolds didn't like it.  Yeah.  I don't think...  He didn't like it at all.  That's what I'm thinking.  Yeah, he didn't like the movie and he thought his agent screwed him.  He screamed at his agent in the parking lot.  Who told us all that?  Someone told us that story.  I don't remember.  I mean, I've known it for a while, but I don't remember who we heard of him. 
[00:25:30]  And he didn't want to promote it or anything?  Right.  Oh, yeah.  I think it was Mark Wahlberg.  He was doing an Irish accent.  Oh, Wahlberg told us.  Yeah, yeah.  That lunatic.  That fucking...  Oh, God.  He's sitting there.  Idiots.  John C. Reilly.  Who's that guy in the end, though?  With the mustache.  He rules.  That fucking...  Was his name Pete?  He just wanted to rob this guy.  Oh, yeah.  What are you doing, man?  He's sitting there like...  He came in for something else. 
[00:26:00]  What?  Oh, man.  What a great fucking scene.  That movie just gets better with age.  It's one you can definitely watch a lot.  And that scene where Mark Wahlberg and...  What's his name?  John Reilly?  Yeah, John C. Reilly.  They're dancing in the disco, and they square off and do that thing where they're smacking  hands with each other and doing this whole thing, right?  It's hilarious.  John C. Reilly, always funny.  Really funny. 
[00:26:30]  I still say he's underrated.  People called me out on that last time I said it, but I still think he's underrated.  I feel like he should be in a lot more movies as a massive fucking star.  Yeah, he's been in quite a few movies.  He has been in a lot of movies, though.  So, maybe I'm wrong.  John C. Reilly.  Back to Bloomberg trying to explain this stupid sugary drink thing.  We're going to have more deaths from obesity than from smoking.  We've got to do something about it.  Everybody's wringing their hands saying, got to do something.  Well, here is a concrete thing.  You can still buy large bottles in stores, but in a restaurant, 16 ounces is the maximum 
[00:27:00]  that they would be able to serve in one cup.  If you want to order two cups at the same time, that's fine.  It's your choice.  We're not taking away anybody's right to do things.  We're simply forcing you to understand that you have to make the conscious decision to go  from one cup to another cup.  But they're not.  This is silly.  They're just not.  To hear him talking about this.  Yeah, you know who that helps?  The cup companies.  Of course.  They're not going to go, oh, wow, I just realized I'm drinking a lot of soda. 
[00:27:30]  That's not going to solve the problem.  What an ass.  Because people that really like their sugary drinks, they're going to stock their fridges  with it.  Yeah.  So what?  When they're out at a restaurant, they're going to just be hassled a little bit to get two drinks.  Yep.  Yeah.  How about you just let people die?  Let people die.  Let people die.  I'm serious.  That's funny. 
[00:28:00]  Just let them die.  Stop trying to save everybody.  You're supposed to have freedom of choice.  Guess what?  Some people understand completely what they're doing and that they're cutting their life expectancy.  But guess what?  They're enjoying themselves.  You have a right to decide for yourself.  And, you know, all right, whatever.  Two cups.  Fucking ten cups in front of you.  There's ten fucking Dixie Riddle cups in front of you at the restaurant.  You're doing shots of soda at some point.  Can I have 80 fucking ounces of soda in shot glasses? 
[00:28:30]  But let's ignore the beer drinking, right, Mayor?  Yeah.  Because you don't want to take on the beer companies now, do you?  No.  You idiot.  Prohibition didn't work.  And then...  Or all the franchise restaurants in Times Square.  They pay a lot of money.  The restaurants themselves are extremely unhealthy.  Yeah.  Just walk in there.  It's more than a fucking worse than a dumb big soda.  I'm obsessed with this because I can't believe anyone is this fucking stupid.  Yeah.  Well, he sure got a lot of news.  Or is this about something else? 
[00:29:00]  Is this about something else that we don't know?  Him getting on the news?  What's the spin?  Making awareness?  Awareness to the situation?  Is that what he's doing?  I like to say the word revenue stream.  Revenue stream.  Or the words revenue stream.  Got us by our purse strings.  Is this some kind of revenue stream they're creating for the city?  Oh, they are saying that, you know, the extra tax on the sodas.  Yeah.  Because you got to buy two.  Because I don't think politicians in general give a fuck about our health ever.  No, I don't think so.  They make believe sometimes. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  But that's just another way to give out tickets and make some revenue.  Two last night on my fucking car and I got back.  What?  You had two tickets?  Yeah, one to have no front plate.  And one to have no inspection sticker, apparently.  Oh, boy.  I leased a new truck.  I don't know.  From Jersey?  Maybe they wouldn't have inspected.  I have to take it to get inspected, I guess.  That's Key Rock.  He's from Jersey.  He is?  Eric, is that what it is?  Because it's not...  Why is my fucking car not inspected?  It's brand new.  I know you don't know.  I don't know. 
[00:30:00]  You don't have a...  I've never bought a brand new car, so I don't know.  But you have a New York registration, right?  Word.  Yeah, see?  You don't have an inspection sticker in your car?  Nah.  Maybe I do.  Were you down at the cellar?  Yes.  Maybe.  It's the little square one right next to the rectangular one.  Well, it's got to be in the window.  It's not.  Do people know what the city does?  What?  They walk around in the middle of the night catching fucking cars.  Oh, wait.  My registration is not...  Wait, wait, wait, wait. 
[00:30:30]  My registration is not displayed.  What about the inspection?  The inspection is, yeah.  Is it expired then?  No, it's 12 of 13.  Then why did you get an inspection sticker?  No, I have one on the thing.  It says 2 of 13.  Yeah.  That's inspection.  Or is that registration?  So what did you get a ticket for?  I got two.  One for no front plate, which I didn't think you needed.  Oh, there you are.  And one for no inspection or registration.  Or Reggie, as I say.  Reggie!  Hey, Reggie.  Oh, is it Reggie then?  It might have been Reggie.  Is that supposed to be displayed on your window?  Yes.  Registration and inspection must be displayed in the left bottom corner. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, no, it's inspection.  No, my registration is my inspection's not.  You never put your sticker on?  I don't know if I got one.  But the dealership should put the sticker on.  I know they should.  The dealership should put the sticker on.  Maybe they can't because they're New York or Jersey.  No, they haven't.  But someone should have told you.  I know.  They didn't tell me.  If it's registered, if you have New York plates, then you have New York inspection and New York registration.  Oh, I don't know.  What do I know?  Kenny, please, just help.  Oh, Kenny, help the young feller out.  Just teach me.  He doesn't know. 
[00:31:30]  What happened?  I know, right?  I don't know.  He doesn't know inspection, registration, Monday, Sunday, Wednesday.  Yeah, it's like I'm driving a whole bunch of red tape around or something, Kenny, you know?  Well, he brought the vehicle in Jersey and registered in New York, so the Jersey dealer didn't help him out.  That wasn't a dealer prepping it.  But if they have the plates, like you said, won't they have the inspection sticker?  You'd think if they have the plates.  Well, they'd have the Reggie, but not the inspection. 
[00:32:00]  Then you'd have to go to an inspection station and get it inspected yourself.  Yeah, the Jersey dealer couldn't give you New York inspection.  Right.  So you have the registration.  You just don't have the inspection.  But they should have told you that.  Yeah, they should have.  Maybe they did.  So you got tickets?  Yeah.  With your cards and everything?  Oh, no.  I was parked.  I came there on the window.  Oh, yeah.  That's a motherfucker.  And that's the point I want to make.  They will walk from street to street.  A lot of them do it in the middle of the night when all the cars are parked for the night. 
[00:32:30]  And they just fucking write tickets.  Yep.  When I used to live on one of the streets with the brownstones, my driveway was the city street.  Yeah.  And I got tickets all the fucking time for registration and inspection stickers.  That's a revenue stream right there.  That is a huge revenue stream.  They love that.  But they don't do it in small town America.  No.  They don't wander around and look in your driveway at your car.  Fucking see if your equipment works.  Right. 
[00:33:00]  They're doing an inspection on your car.  Oh, they're scumbags.  They are fucking douches.  Back to the sugary drinks.  A lot of people making the point, and I just don't go to franchise restaurants, so I forgot  about this.  Free refills.  Oh, right.  Free refills, Mayor Bloomberg.  He'll probably put a stop to that.  Something going on with Bush.  I'm sorry to interrupt you.  She's been holding his arm the whole time.  Oh, man.  And she held it right after the picture was unveiled.  She reached over and grabbed his left arm.  Oh, shit.  And he was doing that weird jaw thing. 
[00:33:30]  With his mouth.  And he's sweating.  I hope he doesn't.  Maybe he was just really nervous.  He was the president.  No, I know.  But going back, I don't know.  I always felt like he got nervous.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I always felt like he was uncomfortable in his own skin when he was in office.  She looked like she was holding him steady, or is he on a medication for something,  I'm saying?  Oh, man.  Maybe it's a medication.  Are there any medications that cause a reaction where you get a weird thing in the fucking  muscles in your mouth?  Yeah.  Wow.  I just noticed that. 
[00:34:00]  Right after the pictures are unveiled, if you can find the footage, she reaches over  and holds his left arm.  I bet...  In a weird way, too.  I bet people start talking about this.  I'm starting.  I bet we're the first.  Let's do this.  Jim Norton has unveiled this, and I bet this will become a big story.  Jim Norton has noticed.  So let's tweet it.  Someone's going to be going, what's...  Because someone will finally go, what's going on with George W. Bush?  They'll study it.  Because no one's mentioning it now.  Because they're just talking about the initial story, which is the unveiling of his painting. 
[00:34:30]  Right.  But he's grinding his teeth.  She was grabbing his arm, and he was sweating like a pig.  Yes.  Back to the stupid mayor.  Oh, yeah.  So what about the refills?  He's ignoring that, right?  Yeah.  I guess, you know, he can't do everything.  He just does one thing and tries to make it seem like it.  It is nonsense.  It's all nonsense.  It's stupid.  But I like to say this a lot, too.  There's so many workarounds.  A workaround.  It's a workaround.  Workarounds.  Free refills is a workaround. 
[00:35:00]  Well, by his own container rule, nobody gets free refills.  But that's not true at all.  Every time there's free refills, you get up and you get more.  Yeah, you can't tell a restaurant not to have free refills.  Right.  But he thinks that people will only drink what's in the container.  That's why he thinks...  Because he's stupid.  Right.  What a distraction.  Because that's what he does.  People can't control what they eat or drink.  Right.  But that's what he does.  He only eats everything on his plate.  Huh?  Distraction?  This is a distraction.  From what?  From everything else that's important that the mayor should be working on. 
[00:35:30]  And he does it on Donut Day.  Yeah.  I'm obsessed with this and I apologize.  And again, of course...  It's just ridiculous.  Of course, I have my own agendas.  But the fact of the matter is, people are very upset with the mayor because of taking  away their personal freedoms of drinking soda.  Yet, you cannot exercise your Second Amendment right in New York City.  So, you know, you can't do that. 
[00:36:00]  And no one's really saying anything about it.  But they're all up in arms about their soda.  Their right to drink a fucking soda.  It's a distraction to the things that really, like, mean something.  So, he throws shit like this out to get people to fucking talk about it.  Look, it's on every fucking news station.  I know.  And they're discussing it, like, seriously.  It's fat back on our food.  And we have a crisis in obesity in New York City and the nation as a whole.  And we think that putting a cap on sort of the default size of sugary beverages makes 
[00:36:30]  an awful lot of sense.  If people want more than that, they can.  But the default size would be a lot more promoting of health than what we have right now.  But are you targeting the right thing?  And the reason I ask that is because there's a CDC study that has said that people really  only tend to get small amounts of their sugar from soda.  Actually, less than 10% of their sugar coming from soda.  So, I just, I sort of, I'm curious about why you chose soda.  Look at the stats on the screen.  Kids between the age of 2 and 19 are only getting up to 8.2% of sugar. 
[00:37:00]  All right, there's a problem.  We're almost done with the mayor.  It's awful that they're doing this.  And I will say, in all defense of Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, I think these companies are realistic.  They're trying to do something about it.  The public wants full sugar drinks.  They would probably make the same amount of money selling diet drinks as full sugar drinks.  And both of those companies have worked hard to try to bring down the calorie count  and get people to act more responsibly.  I would just like to push that from the consumer point of view and force the consumer to make 
[00:37:30]  force the decision and hopefully move over.  You can't force your people to do shit.  You're the boss.  That's against America.  He forced his will to a third term.  Right.  That he forced the city to fucking look like San Francisco or Amsterdam with the potted plants  and all that shit.  Right.  That's what he likes to do.  You can educate, but you can't force.  He loves forcing.  But everyone called fucking Rudy a fascist.  Everyone called Rudy Giuliani.  He's a fascist.  He's a fascist.  And look at the way fucking Bloomberg operates. 
[00:38:00]  He just does it in a sweeter, lilting voice.  He said force.  That's crazy.  In an effeminate voice.  Yeah.  In America, you can't say that.  We're just forcing people.  Oh, that's good.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Now at least we know what you're all about.  Sarah from Buffalo on the Twitter.  One plate chicken Alfredo at the Olive Garden.  A dish a lot of people like.  Sure.  1,440 calories.  Oh.  Now that's not including an appetizer you're going to get before the main dish and all  that, right?  Sure.  Yeah.  And you'll eat some of the bread.  Unlimited breadsticks.  I guarantee you're talking well over 2,000 calories for your meal alone. 
[00:38:30]  Jesus.  32 ounce Pepsi, 400 calories.  Wow.  So he wants to take away the, you know, knock down the 400 calorie thing.  Yeah.  But what about the probably close to 2,000 calorie meal you're going to have at the Olive Garden?  Oh, you got the same tweet.  The Twitter, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Man.  400 calories for a big Pepsi.  Right.  Pepsi stinks.  Guy who doesn't get the point.  To make the decision and hopefully move over to the less fattening drinks and then everybody 
[00:39:00]  with the aspartame.  Pepsi and Coke will still be selling, still be making money for their stockholders is what  they're trying to do and both companies are well-led and really do understand they're  part of our society and they have a vested interest in making sure that the public is  safe and that their products are healthy.  Aspartame, fuck.  Aspartame, fuck.  Yeah, no.  It's not going to work.  It's terrible stuff for you, right?  It's not going to work.  Aren't artificial sweeteners really bad?  Yeah.  Yes.  So why does he want everybody to drink? 
[00:39:30]  You're almost better off to just have sugar.  Diet soda all the time.  You're almost better off.  Contribute to obesity.  Right.  Yeah.  Which causes his own problems.  Right.  Either obesity or your liver falls out.  Yeah.  Great.  But he's forcing his will on the people.  It's like a fucking emperor.  That's great.  Crazy guy.  Good for you, Mayor Boomer.  What a guy.  Luckily, it's donut day, so everybody will feel better anyway.  But it's just fun.  It's just a fun thing.  It's promoting donuts.  A one foot wide donut. 
[00:40:00]  And, you know, when you have something like that, guess what?  A lot of people, it's subconscious, will now have a donut today because it's donut day.  And it's specifically sponsored by Entenmann's.  Right.  Who makes also coffee cakes and, you know.  All the goodies.  Yeah.  Chocolate chip muffins.  What's that?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Treats.  Yeah.  I just, I also see it as a distraction.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You want to see Bush at the White House yesterday? 
[00:40:30]  Fuck yeah, man.  He was funny, man.  He's a funny guy, man.  Obama, again, is a Harvard.  Bush, the C student is funnier than the A, Harvard Law Review.  Always.  That's the way it is.  Always.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's just a good old boy, you know.  He makes me, Bush of all the presidents, I thought was by far the funniest.  The funniest guy.  Not that that's what you look for in a president, but if you have to judge the funniest one.  Yeah, yeah.  And I don't mean ironically funny.  Like, he doesn't know he's funny.  I mean, he delivers lines fucking hilarious.  Clinton was kind of funny. 
[00:41:00]  Not like Bush.  He was pretty stiff.  Bush is definitely better.  Yeah, because he didn't, Clinton didn't have, like, Bush is big at self-deprecating.  Give me your top five.  Well, there's only five alive, so I'll go with Bush.  I would give.  How about Bush Sr.?  Bush Sr. of the five living, probably the least.  He tried.  Yeah, but him or Carter the least.  Oh, Carter is a dud.  Let's put him.  Carter was never funny.  No, he wasn't.  I just...  Was Gerald Ford?  Reagan was kind of funny.  Reagan was funny.  Reagan was funny.  Reagan was a funny guy.  Reagan was a funny dude compared to... 
[00:41:30]  Do you remember Reagan being children of the 80s?  Was JFK?  I mean...  You just put Velcro on the ceiling.  Yes.  JFK, I don't...  I think...  I don't know.  Obviously, I don't know.  Maybe back then they didn't joke around as much.  Hey, Mimi.  Come here.  Mimi Beardsley.  Dude, I'm now waking up hearing that.  Oh, Mimi Beardsley.  Yeah.  It's me.  That's great.  Mimi Beardsley.  We're going to have to play that today.  She was beautiful, by the way. 
[00:42:00]  You look at some of the...  Oh, the old pictures of her, yeah.  Wow.  She was hot, man.  Yeah, back in the day, he was tagging some fucking hot ass.  Word.  That Mimi Beardsley.  But her name was awful.  So, Clint wasn't...  Who was number two, then?  Fuck the list.  I would say Bush.  And then who?  Either Clinton or Obama.  I mean...  Obama?  That is horrendous.  But I'm saying compared to...  Obama tries to be funny, which I like.  He tries so very hard.  He fucks it up, though, in the delivery.  He's a big Chappelle fan.  Like, that's his favorite show, was the Chappelle show. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  Neil Brennan met Obama because he was writing for Seth Meyers at the White House Correspondents  Dinner.  And Neil was, like, co-creator with Dave on the show, and he wrote for him.  Sure.  Neil's a monster.  Yeah, he's a funny guy.  Oh.  Great writer.  Neil Brennan's...  Oh, my God.  He's a monster.  And he was talking about...  That's great.  They introduce you.  Like, they tell the president who you are when you walk up, because he meets everybody.  Right.  And when he found out that Neil co-created Chappelle's show, he was like, oh, Michelle.  Like, he was like, oh, he co-created...  Like, he was actually psyched...  Oh, wow.  ...to meet somebody who was involved with the Chappelle show. 
[00:43:00]  Oh.  That's kind of neat.  That's kind of neat.  ...Upset me.  Well, let's just play Bush.  So, what?  They're unveiling the big portrait?  Yeah.  Why do they take so long to get the portrait done?  I guess it takes a while to paint that motherfucker.  Yeah.  So, but three and a half years later, they finally get it up there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And what is it?  Is it a hallway with all the past presidents or something?  It looks life-size.  But where do these things go in the White House?  Right over the Obama bed.  Pop it up there.  I guess it's a hallway. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, probably.  What happens when they run out of rooms?  Do some of these presidents' portraits go in the attic?  I bet, like, yeah, Buchanan.  I bet he goes.  Yeah.  Taft.  Would you love, like...  Harrison.  Would you love a tour of the White House of the shit they don't show anybody?  How great would that be?  Like the basement, just weird places.  Yeah.  Storage rooms that they just have stuff laying around that any museum would kill for.  Yeah.  I don't know, man.  How do you do that? 
[00:44:00]  You have to have major clearance, right?  Oh, man.  To get, like, a behind-the-scenes thing?  I don't even know if that's available.  Do they have, like, a shed somewhere?  Ah, the White House shed.  Tools.  A rake.  The presidential rake.  You know they got some shit underground, too.  How great would that be?  I would love that.  All right, so they unveil a portrait for Bush.  He goes up on the wall, and Bush has a few jokes.  Behave yourselves.  Mr. President, thank you for your warm hospitality. 
[00:44:30]  Madam First Lady, thank you so much for inviting our rowdy friends to my hanging.  Oh, oh, hanging in the picture.  And I are honored to be here, Mr. Vice President.  Thank you for coming.  We are overwhelmed by your hospitality.  And thank you for feeding the Bush family, all 14 members of us who are here.  I want to thank our girls for coming. 
[00:45:00]  I want to thank mom and dad, brothers, sister, in-laws, aunts and uncles.  I appreciate you taking your time.  I know you're as excited as Lauren and me to be able to come back here and particularly  thank the people who helped make this house a home for us for eight years, the White House  staff.  I want to thank-  I'll pause real quick.  Do you know what it is?  I bet you he is nervous.  He hasn't spoken publicly like this.  He's speaking in the White House again for the first time in like three and a half years.  Yeah.  He did this all the time, but he hasn't done this in years. 
[00:45:30]  And what happens to an ex-president?  Like, he doesn't get total clearance anymore, right?  No.  I bet he can walk around pretty much do what he wants.  Bush could probably go anywhere.  Yeah.  Who's going to say no?  I don't know.  How does that work?  I bet he can just walk right up to the gate.  Hey, let me in.  You think?  Does anyone know the answer to that?  I forgot something under the bed.  He probably doesn't legally have it, but-  But everyone's like, all right, we know what the law is, but what the rule is.  He's the guy.  Right.  Yeah. 
[00:46:00]  I wonder how that works.  I wonder about dumb stuff like that.  I bet you do.  Huh?  I bet you get like, just for being the president, you get like all the time clearance.  Do you have like a card on you?  Kind of like a PBA type card?  No, but I bet there's like, you know, common courtesy.  You don't just stroll into the Oval Office and sit down.  Right.  But I bet, you know, you could go in there and talk to the guys.  Hey, you know, hey, I want to talk to this guy.  Hey.  I bet you you can't.  You don't think?  Not as easily as you're saying.  I bet you can.  I bet just because you're the president, I bet you got like clearance for life. 
[00:46:30]  They talked to, I read something in either Time or Newsweek had an article about the president's  club, which there's five of them alive.  Continental?  Oh.  Different.  You're flying around, zippity-doodle and stuff.  I remember one time I was in coach.  No, you don't shut up.  I got off the subject, Chip.  Chip gets distracted easily.  It's new medicine.  Is it new medicine?  How they have this, they talk to each other.  Like, Clinton would talk to Bush.  Yeah.  Um, they just, they understand something about each other and the job. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  Nobody else alive understands.  Like, literally, even Carter hates Bush, but like, you know, Bush Sr. and Clinton, who  seem like unlikely allies, they understand something about each other that no one on the  earth understands.  They have a knowledge.  Imagine if, okay, the five of us in this room, imagine if this was the only radio show  in the country, who would we talk about fucking radio with?  Yeah.  Each other.  Nobody else would get it.  And that's, I mean, that's how we feel with our pomposity, but.  Yeah, of course. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, we barely talk to other radio guys.  But you know what I'm saying?  But when you do, you're like, oh, okay, you know the dumb shit we deal with.  You look at each other differently.  Right, right.  You get it a little bit differently.  Sorry.  He just looks nervous to me.  By the way, he's not killing.  Not yet, no.  I guess the news decided to chop this up and make him look like he's amazing.  All serious.  Because I'm sweating over here.  This is not showing Bush killing you.  Well, he's just doing some thank you.  Mission accomplished.  Yeah, hit it.  ...and Bill Allman, the White House curator.  Oh.  I am pleased that my portrait brings an interesting symmetry to the White House collection. 
[00:48:00]  It now starts and ends with a George W.  George Washington, the first.  Okay.  At least just warming up.  When the British burned the White House, as Fred mentioned, in 1814, Dolly Madison famously  saved this portrait of the first George W.  Now, Michelle, if anything happens, there's your man. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's a weird man.  Yeah.  He's having like an eight and a half so far.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, Michelle will run out of the White House with his painting.  I also believe, Mr. President, that when you are wandering these halls, as you wrestle  with tough decisions, you will now be able to gaze at this portrait and ask, what would 
[00:49:00]  George do?  I am honored to be hanging near a man who gave me the greatest gift possible, unconditional  love.  And that would be number 41.  His pops.  Got a little choked up there.  Yeah. 
[00:49:30]  Where's pops?  They didn't give him a good seat.  He's halfway in the back, isn't he?  I hear he's in a wheelchair.  And they're probably requesting they don't show him.  Oh, boy.  I'm guessing they're requesting that they don't show him.  Because I've heard they've kept it under wraps, so he's in a wheelchair.  Oh, boy.  And he's back there all along.  He's no kidding.  Who is he?  They're not really set up for a five-camera shoot in this thing.  Sure.  Well, how about they know the ex-president's there?  I want to thank John Howard Sandin for agreeing to use his consent. 
[00:50:00]  I've had considerable talents to paint my likeness.  You've done a fine job with a challenging subject.  In the portrait, there's a painting by W.H.D. Kerner called A Charge to Keep.  It hung in the Oval Office for eight years of my presidency.  I asked John to include it because it reminds me of the wonderful people with whom I was privileged to serve.  Whether they served in the cabinet or on the presidential staff, these men and women, many of whom are here, worked hard and served with honor. 
[00:50:30]  Lewinsky served on the presidential staff.  We've had a charge to keep, and we kept the charge.  It is my privilege to introduce the greatest first lady ever.  Sorry, Mom.  The way he goes, bah.  Sorry, Mom.  Would you agree to a tie? 
[00:51:00]  A woman who brought such grace and dignity and love in this house.  Who's he talking about?  Oh, he's talking about his wife.  Oh, that makes sense.  Thank you all.  Is that it?  Thanks, everybody.  Now she babbles.  She's a nice lady.  Did you tell any jokes?  I thought we said he killed.  He did.  Well, he did pretty much kill that.  For the press who hates him?  The press who's loving him.  They loved him.  We don't need her, right?  No, she had a funny line.  I don't remember what she said.  Yeah. 
[00:51:30]  That would have been great, though.  Some reporter just stands up.  What about 9-11, man?  Just ruins the whole moment.  What happened?  Yeah.  What was that?  Throw a shoe at him.  Imagine if she gave.  Remember how excited he was?  He was so into the shoe thing.  He ducked that shoe, and he's like, come on.  Come on.  Let's play.  You got another one.  There's three presidents in that room, though.  Yeah.  Oh.  Bush, Obama.  No, Bush, Obama, and Bush.  Was Clinton there?  He didn't acknowledge Clinton.  Clinton wasn't there?  You would think Clinton would be there. 
[00:52:00]  No, they probably don't do for portrait.  Look at the shoe-throwing incident.  He loves that he's in a little fucking game now.  A little battle.  Look.  Come on.  You got another one?  Come on.  That guy was amazing to get both shoes off.  How the fuck did they not just shoot him?  Just take that guy and blast him.  You don't want to.  Throwing shoes at the president.  The smile on his face because he knows there's a second shoe that he has to fucking duck out  of the way of.  He's dodging.  He loved it.  It's great.  I'll catch the shoe. 
[00:52:30]  You're out.  But he actually reaches down and grabs.  Oh, they pulled him right down.  Coming in today.  Chris Hemsworth, huh?  Chris Hemsworth.  He was Thor in The Avengers.  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  And he's in that Snow White and the Huntsman movie.  Oh, yeah.  That movie looks all right.  I didn't realize he was Captain Kirk's dad in that 2009 Star Trek movie.  Remember?  The little reboot?  He was the guy at the beginning that was in the movie until he died in the beginning. 
[00:53:00]  Why don't we have a new Star Trek movie yet?  You just said 2009.  I'm like, fuck.  We should have gotten one already.  Oh, they're filming.  Oh, yeah.  They should pump those out one a year.  Oh, I'm psyched.  One every year and a half.  Come on.  Let's do this.  I hear tell Khan.  Oh, shit.  He's going to be in this one.  Yeah.  Khan.  J.J. Abrams did Super 8 in the meantime.  Pretty psyched.  Oh, that was smart. 
[00:53:30]  How about you stick with the Star Trek shit?  Yeah.  He's all over the place with that fucking bad robot.  Yeah.  Amazing.  Yeah.  I like his stuff.  So we got him.  We got Chris Hemsworth.  He's a superhero.  He's Thor.  The mighty Thor.  Thor isn't the gay one, right?  Thor is not the gay one.  No, it's Green Lantern.  Green Lantern.  He's now gay.  He's gay.  I heard that on the news.  Why do they have to be gay?  Why do they have to be gay?  Why do they have to be straight?  Why do they have to be anything?  Why do we care?  Why do they have fucking press releases about this? 
[00:54:00]  They're fake things.  They're not real.  So why does he have to be gay?  Why does the Green Lantern have to be gay?  And were there signs?  I don't know if there were signs, but...  I mean, having social messages in comic books isn't new.  No?  No.  Give us an example.  X-Men is all...  What?  You know...  What is that?  Society treating mutants as different, even though they're human beings.  Fuck that.  They could kick our ass.  Gotta keep them in check.  You're on the side.  I'm on the other side. 
[00:54:30]  Fuck the mutants.  You're against the X-Men.  Who's the other gay superhero?  On the way in, they told me two.  The Green Lantern and somebody else.  It's Dr. Gay.  He is a producer for a radio show.  Superman's gay.  Superman.  Obviously.  Yeah, they call him pooper, man.  We used to call him that.  That's good.  Big pee on his chest.  No, it's not.  And I guess Batwoman, not Batgirl...  That's Batwoman.  ...is a lesbian.  Lesbo.  Is she really?  I learned that today out of the way in.  Batwoman.  Yeah, because 1010 Wins was talking about this. 
[00:55:00]  You know, because this is real news.  Like it's real.  And Batwoman is a lesbian.  Traffic and weather together after this.  Crazy.  It's so stupid.  It's not real.  I'm losing my mind.  Why are news stations talking about superheroes being gay or not?  Why?  I don't know.  And the Green Lantern is gay.  Sports next.  I'm being told North Star from X-Men.  Is gay?  Yeah, but that's not a big thing.  No.  North Star.  Oh, look at this. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, look at that.  X-Men.  Two men kissing on the cover of an X-Men comic book.  Jesus Christ.  Speaking of gay, you know, it's not slanderous.  I saw that.  To call someone gay now.  It's not?  Yeah, when you say like, oh, Tom Cruise is gay.  Like, you can say that.  Where'd you hear that?  Well, can you say that?  Sure can.  Why?  No, I don't think you can say that.  Yeah, you can say that.  Well, now hold on.  Because it's just like, what?  I don't know if you can say that.  You can say that.  But they can still sue you for it.  What you're saying is, you'll probably win. 
[00:56:00]  Right.  However, you will have to pay to defend the lawsuit.  Well, I was just using it as an example.  Yeah, of course.  I think what they meant with the lawsuit was, you know, stop being gay.  Oh, is that it?  You know how we use that?  You know how we say faggot and stuff, but we don't mean like sucking dick.  Right.  I think that's what they were getting at with that lawsuit.  Because someone, you know, said to another person, you know.  He wasn't accusing him of- 
[00:56:30]  I think he was accusing him of being gay.  You sure?  You know what?  All right.  Saying gay.  After the break, let's find that article and figure this shit out.  Yeah, let's do that.  We'll figure it all out.  Because I assumed it was the other thing.  Where, you know, you have a co-worker and you're like, oh man, stop being gay.  No, I don't think so.  It wasn't that.  No.  Wow.  Really?  No, I think it was the other way.  I think it was actual gayness.  Huh.  Gayosity.  Well, guess what?  There's our tease.  We'll find out along with you.  Are we doing Mimi Beardsley or no?  What do you got, Iraq?  I think she's Mimi Beardsley. 
[00:57:00]  I was going to do one of the George Bush remixes, but if you want to-  All right, do that.  Do that.  I don't care.  Okay.  All right.  There's been a lot of talk about this next song.  This song is not a rebel song.  This song is Sunday.  I can't believe the news today.  I can't close my eyes and make it go away.  How long?  How long as we sing this song? 
[00:57:30]  How long?  Too, too, too long.  Too long.  Tonight.  We can be as one.  Tonight.  Tonight.  Tonight.  Broken bottles under children's feet.  Body stones across the dead in the streets.  But I won't need the battle hall.  It puts my back up.  It puts my back up.  It's the wall.  Sunday.  Bloody Sunday.  Sunday.  Bloody Sunday.  Sunday.  Bloody Sunday. 
[00:58:00]  Sunday.  Bloody Sunday.  How long, how long must we sing this song? 
[00:58:30]  How long?  Too, too, too long.  Too long.  Tonight.  We can be as one.  Tonight.  Tonight.  Tonight.  Sunday.  Bloody Sunday.  Sunday.  Bloody Sunday.  Let's read it.  Anyone who wants more details on my agenda can find them online.  The web address is not very imaginative, but it's easy to remember. 
[00:59:00]  Part, part, dot.  I.  Wipe the tears from your eyes  Wipe your tears away  White your lava-shut eyes  diciendo  Love you Sunday  I love you Sunday 
[00:59:30]  Let's roll  And it's true, not a mean  One fact is fiction and TV reality  And today's mean is hot  We eat and drink while tomorrow they die  Sunday, what is Sunday?  Sunday, what is Sunday?  Sunday, what is Sunday?  Sunday, what is Sunday?

[01:01:00]  Coming in  And we're all talking about how fucking good looking this guy is  And I joined the discussion  I usually don't join these discussions  But this fucking guy is  Because you're the one we're usually talking about  I'm going to beg him not to steal our women  Yeah, I was saying  Like if he's hitting on your chick 
[01:01:30]  You just kind of got to  Just step aside and allow it  Yeah, this guy  You can't even get mad at your girl  She bangs him  We don't like  You know  Interviewing good looking guys, man  It's not cool, man  So he's in the bathroom  Fucking dumping right now  And he's dropping a few fucking turds  And he'll be in here  Big Thor logs  Big Thor logs  They sound like thunder  Pow  They're all made of steel and metal  They got a great contract

Didn't they all sign like  Oh yeah  Shitload of movies  For years  Man  Lots of movies and lots of years  That's smart  Job security  But he's not here to talk about Thor  And the Avengers, right?  Right  He's talking about that movie  Snow White and the Huntsman  Oh, it's Kristen Stewart's in that?  Yeah  Oh, okay  Is that a chick flick?  Snow White and the Huntsman?  No  From the Twilights  I like her  You sure?  Charlize Theron  Okay, wow  Charlize Theron  She's fucking hot  We met her many years ago  Oh, many years ago 
[01:02:30]  Where?  At NAW  Did you?  She came as a girlfriend of somebody  Yes, that's right  Yeah, yeah  Well, it doesn't matter anymore  Of course, I could say  Third Eye Blind  And then that douche  I fucking hated that guy  God, I hated that guy  And then he's like  Please, you know  Please don't mention  That she's sitting out there  I'd really appreciate it  And we were fucking  That was when we were still  Kind of like  Sort of fucking  Yeah  Wimpy-ish  But what were we gonna say?  We were on our way  To become the dicks that you know 
[01:03:00]  It was all, you know  But we were still listening  To people back there  Like, okay, alright  We won't mention it  Jesus Christ  He's only like  A massive fucking star now  Yeah  Chris Hemsworth  Hello  How are you?  Hi Chris, how are you?  Very good  Welcome to the  O'Brien Anthony Show  Hi  Thanks for having me  How are you doing?  We held the door open for you  So you could go in the bathroom  Yes, thanks  Take a seat  We're on the air  We do it  We just do it this way  I need these now  It's a lot easier  They look cool though, don't they?  It's early for you, right?  You don't get up this early  No, not really 
[01:03:30]  Well, yes I do  Sometimes  I mean, I've got in from London  About  Just a day or two ago  So  A little jet lag  You know  It's not too bad  From London to here  Is alright  LA is that little bit  Yeah, yeah  I want to be able to tell someone  I just came in from London  That sounds so cool  I just came in from London  So take a flight  Come back  And say you just came in from London  We just came in from Cleveland recently  Oh, great  That's what we get  Fantastic  That's exotic where I come from  You know  Yeah, yeah  Is it?  Yeah  Alright, fair enough 
[01:04:00]  Whereabouts are you from in Australia?  Melbourne  Melbourne  A lot of people say Melbourne  Melbourne  That's Melbourne  Who said Melbourne recently?  It was somebody on stage  Oh, Keith Robinson  Who's a comic  Who just did a tour of Melbourne  And he's a dummy from Philly  And he's on  And he goes  Yeah, there's some Australians  In the audience  He goes  I'm from Melbourne  I was in Melbourne  It's like  You fucking phony  You were there for 20 minutes  Trying to cop the accent  It really annoyed me  Just drop the R  Yeah  You were a soap star too  In Australia too 
[01:04:30]  How many episodes a week  Were you doing?  Oh, we used to shoot  It was about five episodes a week  Oh, you were on every day?  Yeah  And we'd do 20 scenes a day  And multi-cam  And it was  It was like  It made  Everyone thinks  It never receives any respect  You know, shows like that  It's just a soap  It's harder than anything else  I've ever done  It's gotta be  You don't have much lead time  To learn your lines  And there's terrible scripts  Most of the time  You know, you're trying to make  Something for work  And you know, literally  You know, 15 minutes to shoot a scene 
[01:05:00]  Whereas in a film  You have days  Right, right  You have millions of dollars  To spend on the script  And rehearsals  How do you memorize all that?  That seems impossible  It's funny because  You start to know the writing so well  Of the character  And it's just, you know  It becomes kind of predictable  Let me guess  I'm in a plane crash  Or there's an earthquake  And, you know  I've got my fourth child  And I'm married six times  Do they do the same thing 
[01:05:30]  In Australian soaps  As American ones  Where when they go to  Commercial break  You gotta sit there  And kind of just look at the camera  And make those eyes  Like  It's that sort of steely guys  Yeah, yeah  And then it's like  They ask you something  Is someone gonna call cop?  But what about Bob?  And then you gotta go like  Oh, yeah  What about it?  And as you're making the face  They zoom in slowly  And the music plays  And they  It's constantly sort of like  Exposition for other people's characters  Like, oh, did you hear about  You know, John just got back from  Yabby Creek  And went fishing 
[01:06:00]  And da, da, da  It's like  Yeah, what does that have to do with me?  Wait a minute  I'm here  What was your character's name?  Kim  Kim  And what kind of a guy were you in the  Like, what was your job in the soap?  What was your thing?  I swear to God  He was the lifeguard  And then he had a drug problem  And he was in high school  But then left high school  And became  A real estate agent  And then that didn't work  And then became a bartender  Then got married three times  And literally had  Four different kids  From different women  And stayed 19 
[01:06:30]  For three and a half years  On the show  It was  I never had a birthday  Oh, that's funny  I was watching the soap yesterday  In the gym  I was doing a little elliptical  And  Good, low impact  It was a soap one  Low result  Oh, it's me  We're laughing  Oops  But it was  It was a soap that was on  One of the TVs  And I was thinking of exactly that  Like the amount of  Shooting these guys do  That's unbelievable  And memorize  Script-wise  Is awesome  Yeah, it gets you ready 
[01:07:00]  For everything else  I think  It's like  That was the best training I had  Are you glad you got up early  To talk about soap operas  Yeah, right  Yeah  Instead of a huge  Hollywood blockbuster  That's coming out  Yeah  Snow White and the Huntsman  Yeah, man  At theaters today  Probably  You said  Prepare you for something like that  Like they kind of get you  Yeah  You know, they make your acting  This is probably easy  Compared to that shit  Yeah, no, it is  To be honest  I mean, it's  It's a  You know, you just have more time  And you have better scripts  And you know, the whole process 
[01:07:30]  Is in your favor  But  There's also things like  There's the bad habits  You've got to get rid of  Which is  The steely gaze  Off to the side of the camera  Right  Oh, they didn't want Thor  Looking like that  You guys don't  You're not going to cut  To commercial break here  It's a movie, Chris  How was Kristen Stewart  Because I didn't know  I just actually looked out  And saw that she was  The co-star  Yeah  She's great  Yeah, a lot of fun  I mean, I met her and Charlize  Kind of a couple of weeks  Before we started shooting  Very briefly 
[01:08:00]  And then  Once I landed  In London to shoot  It was kind of  You know  It didn't stop  From then onwards  In four months  And then  As big a film as it was  It had this kind of  Smaller feel to it  Because it was a tight little crew  And cast  And we all went from  You know  Various obscure locations  Snowcapped sort of mountains  And cathedrals  And big beautiful dark forests  And down to Wales  And the beaches  And it was just  It was just beautiful  And there was no kind of  Running back to the trailer  In between shots and things 
[01:08:30]  Because they were  They were obscure  You know, spots  And it was just beautiful  Sort of  One of the more visceral  Kind of organic sets  I've been on  You know, all four  And Avengers  Was green screen  Right, right  Which was mind numbing  Yeah, yeah  What am I fighting?  What's it look like?  A lot of that, yeah  Staring at a spot on a wall  Literally, yeah  A tennis ball next to the camera  Yeah, yeah  Is that how you do it?  A lot of the time, yeah  Yeah  Occasionally the actor's there  Or occasionally  It's, you know  Most of the time  It's not an actor  I mean, we literally 
[01:09:00]  There was a scene  In the Avengers  That big ensemble  Where we're all kind of there  And just the 360 pan  Of all of us  And Renny goes  What the  Who the fuck  What does this thing look like?  And all of us went  Yeah, what's happening here?  And then they had to come over  And explain like  Okay, there's this big Leviathan  What is that?  Big alien shit  I'm like, okay, hang on  But we're just in the middle  Of kind of, you know  Swinging at different directions  And shooting things  And realised we had no idea  What we were fighting  When in doubt  Give it a steely gaze  Gaze  That's it  Just look at it 
[01:09:30]  Do they  When they green screen like that  Will they shoot your action first  And then kind of  Mould whatever the computer animations are  Around you  Or do they do the computer animations first  They go, no, no, no  Swing up more  A bit of both  I mean, they  Yeah, they'll shoot us first  But they'll have in mind  Where it's going to be  And they'll say, you know  You've got to step here  And do this and this  And, you know  There's other times when they  Just kind of, you know  Add it all in  But  Yeah, yeah  We'll fix it in the mix  Is it weird  Is it weird doing something 
[01:10:00]  And then seeing  Is it weird seeing yourself  Fight some mythical creature  On camera  That was not in the room with you  Yeah, especially when it works too  Like, you might  You just  It doesn't matter  How many times you do it  It just always feels ridiculous  Right  And especially when you're screaming  Or you're emotional  And whatever  And the crew's standing around  Like, you know  This green soundstage  In the middle of New Mexico  Bored, you know  And then all of a sudden  It's like, oh, actually  Yeah, there's a building  And there's a monster  And there's a  Wow  That must be something  To see the finished product  When you, you know  There was nothing there 
[01:10:30]  It was, yeah  There was actually a big troll  That I had to fight  In Snow White and the Huntsman  And that was  That was  It was actually  In this sort of  Very shallow creek  And they had like  Little landmines  So to speak  That would shoot up water  So, you know  As I was running  From the troll  It would look like  That was the troll stepping  Oh, man  And then they'll put  They'll put the troll  In later  But the actual water  Is  Which made it really interesting  Like trying to run backwards  And fight with these 
[01:11:00]  Like, you know  Semi-landmines under me  And literally like  Wait a second  And they're  Big, big  Sort of, you know  Punches out of the water  And they were like  Yeah, don't step there  And swing an axe this way  And so  Who is the Huntsman?  What do you like  The Huntsman is just  What is your role?  He's kind of a  He's a bit of  He's a mercenary  But he's a  He's a  He's lost his wife  Years before  And some  Tragic circumstances  And he's a drunk  He's a  He's a lost soul  And he's hired  Initially to 
[01:11:30]  Capture Snow White  And, you know  He purely had a personal gain  The Queen  Promises him  Something  And  So he does it  And then  You know  Knowing full well  Kind of what they intend  To do with her  They mention sort of  Cutting out her heart  And what have you  And then his sort of  Conscience starts to  Creep back in  And the light in her  And, you know  That the beauty  And strength  That, you know  Affects the universe  Around her eventually  Is what he sees  And starts to kind of  Sober up  And think, okay  Maybe I should be 
[01:12:00]  Doing something else here  Who does Charlize play?  Is she the Queen?  Yeah, the evil Queen  Yeah  Yeah, a little darker  Than the cartoon  Yeah  I said yesterday  The dwarves  They're not sleepy  And grumpy  And what have you  They're a band  Of drunken criminals  And they have us  Hogtied  And hanging upside down  And rob us  That's their introduction  Yeah  But played by  Ian McShane  Bob Hoskins  And Ray Winston  And just all those  Classic English kind of  Are they real people?  Or are they  They had little people 
[01:12:30]  Doubles  Oh, they did  So they're the real actors  And then they had  The little people  With the prosthetics  That looked like the actors  And then they'd sort of  You know, in certain shots  It'd be them  And in certain shots  It'd literally be  Me standing on a  On a platform  And Ray Winston  Standing  On the ground  And somehow it works  You know  So much of Tom Cruise's  Scenes have to be done  Because he's a short guy  And he'll be with  A taller actress  And sometimes  They actually have to  Put her in something lower  Like when they're  Walking down a hallway  Or whatever  So they look like  They belong together  You're a tall gentleman 
[01:13:00]  I had to do  Like I'd have to straddle  Spread my legs  Oh really?  And so  To be lower  A lot of the time  How tall are you?  6'3  Oh, okay  Yeah  That was on the soap  When they couldn't really move  The cameras were pretty  Kind of in the one spot  You know  So it's like  Find your lens  What's like  The first movie  You did  That was really  Kind of  Hey, I think  I think I'm  On to something here  It was Star Trek  It was Star Trek  What a great  Opening sequence 
[01:13:30]  That was  I was  You know  I've been a Star Trek fan  For years  And it was just  That was  That boy  If that didn't  Pull you in  Yeah  You're  You just  You have nothing  Going for you  It was amazing  It's funny  Because  I really knew  Nothing about  What the film  Was going to be  And yet  The rest of the town did  And I'd sort of  Just arrived  And I'd sent a tape  Early on  And it was sort of  Last minute phone call  Where JJ Abrams  The director  Called and said  Look  Can you come in tonight  Like Friday afternoon  I was like 
[01:14:00]  Okay, yeah  And I said  I don't know the script  Or whatever  And read at the desk  With him  In his office  And he goes  Okay, great  You got the part  You start Monday  Holy shit  And it was better  It happened that way  Because by the time  I'd finished shooting  Which was only a week  Or something  I went  Oh, this is a pretty  Big deal  This film  And then started  Kind of shitting myself  Can I do it over again  Wait a minute  If I'd known that prior  I'd probably  Have been a lot more nervous  Yeah, it was  One of those  Opening sequences  Where you're kind of 
[01:14:30]  Not sure what's going on  Like initially  I think everybody  Thinks you're  James T. Kirk  And then it's like  Oh, okay  It's his dad  It was really  A great movie  It's funny  For like  The next year or two  I'd just be mistaken  For Chris Pine  Oh, really?  And a lot of people  Actually, we came into  The premiere  With my younger brother  And someone came up  And said  Chris, Chris, Chris  And they're like  I think you're talking  To my brother  They're like  No, you're Chris Pine  Thought he was Chris Pine  But it was a fun role  Yeah 
[01:15:00]  That's a good project  To be  How nice is it to be  A part of a movie  That's made  1.3 billion already  Oh, yeah, yeah  Like you're made  In Hollywood  When that happens  Because they just know  That you're associated  With such a big project  Yeah, sure, sure  It's huge  We all, I guess  Had an idea  It was going to be big  Because the individual  Films had worked  But on this scale  I mean, every week  Even they just  They predicted  Arcade will open  At this amount  And then outdid that  And again each weekend  And the best thing  Was the reviews  Were so good 
[01:15:30]  Not often do you  Have that combination  And not only that  But just people  Word of mouth  Yeah  From people that have  Seen it  Not like just  Critics or something  Yeah  Everybody I've talked to  That has seen it  Is just like  It's amazing  Yeah  The action sequences  Are fantastic  Yeah  It was good fun  What are you doing  After that  Like you shot  I mean Kristen Stewart  Coming off of the  Twilights  Which are  I really like the  Twilights  I mean I don't like  To talk about it a lot  But I do enjoy them  Yeah I do enjoy them  You guys are both  Coming off massive movies 
[01:16:00]  Yeah I did a film  Which is kind of  Refreshing  Because it wasn't  That sort of  200 million dollar  Budget sort of feel  And you know  It was a film  With Ron Howard  Based in the 70s  A true story  About Nicky Lauda  And James Hunt  Formula 1 drivers  And their rivalry  On and off the track  And James who I play  Is a British race car driver  And he was  Basically  The rock star  Of the Formula 1  And refused to  Sort of  Conform to  You know  The establishment  And you know 
[01:16:30]  Dress up  And you know  It's classic  Like we never wear a suit  And bare feet  To events  With or all family  And whatever  And this is the world champion  And would drink  And party and smoke  And throw up  Before every race  Because you just  Wound up or drunk  Or both  You know  And then on the track  Was just kind of  You know  Chaotic  And whereas Nicky Lauda  Was much more  Sort of calculated  And maybe  But it was  It was great  It was a  You know  Smaller budget  Intimate sort of film  And it's refreshing 
[01:17:00]  It wasn't  You know  Full of fight sequences  And CGI  How much time  Have you spent in London?  I just  I shot two movies there  And I'm about to shoot  4.2 there  So  Which will  By the time I finish  That will be  A year and a half  What's 4.2?  Thor  Oh Thor 2  I'm sorry  You said 4.2  Okay  It's my lisp  I'm four  Did you have  A dialogue coach  Or were you just  Pretty natural  At picking it up  Because even as  George Kirk  You know  You always have  Dialogue coaches 
[01:17:30]  Yeah  You know  Like  American  90% of our TV  And film  As kids  Is  You know  From here  In Australia  And so  I think you have  A bit more  Of an ear for it  Than maybe  The Brits do  But look  You just  It's about  Having a good coach  And  You gotta work hard  To Americans  It's pretty funny  I mean  All the time  To see an actor  And go like  Wait what  What the fuck  Is he talking like that 
[01:18:00]  The whole cast  Of The Wire  Is fucking  British  And Scottish  Yeah  Gary Oldman  I never knew  Yeah  It always throws you off  Perfect  Didn't he  Can you do  You can do  American then  Oh yeah  Yeah  It's something  I haven't  I was saying  The other day  When I first  Got to the States  I did like  Three or four films  All in American  And kind of  Had it down  And now  I've been doing  Sort of  British accents  For the last two years  So it's  You just gotta  Then get your head  Back in that  Sort of  Zone  You know  Now I've noticed  With Australian accents 
[01:18:30]  There's like  Two different things  There's like you  But then there's this thing  And we always goof about it  How they'd kind of  Go up at the end  Yeah  Like talk  I was outside  Yeah  Like what  What is it  Is that just  A different place  Or  I don't know  It kind of drives you crazy  Because  Like  It's this upward inflection  On everything  And everything  Everything's a slight  Sort of apology  Or  You know  Non-committal  Sort of  It seems tentative  Go down the street  Maybe  Are you asking me 
[01:19:00]  If you can go down the street  Uh  No  It's like  I'm Ron Burgundy  It's  I had a dialect  A voice teacher  In Australia  Who just  He was like  You've all got to  Stop doing that  You know  Because it's  I guess it's  Probably akin to  A southern accent  Versus a northern accent  Here  You know  It's just  It's gotta be  Different types  I guess it's  Sort of like  From state to state  There's variations  Right  It's more just 
[01:19:30]  Sort of  It's more attitude  That varies  Than sort of  Like  It's not like  Say Boston  You know  That's  Yeah  California  That's just weird  Boston  Yeah  Well it works  I just really want to  Play a superhero  Oh Jimmy  Jimmy  We'll have you  Oh Jimmy  We're just some kind of  A creepy villain  But what kind of superhero  Would you be  I don't know  Probably more of a villain  Just a mediocre guy  Mediocre guy  I was saying  That's not threatening  No 
[01:20:00]  I had a mediocre plan  Maybe I'll take over the world  I wish there was a comic book hero  That just looked like me  Like some frump  Like from years ago  Frump man  Yeah  Something  He was in Spider-Man though  So he's  You know  He's down playing  He knows  The original  Of course  He really was in  Spider-Man  I didn't know  Yeah  He had a big role  No I'm just kidding  I only had one line  I'm the king of like one line  The original like is in  2001  Yeah  Yeah  We didn't even know  I made it into the final cut  Of the movie  Until one of the fans 
[01:20:30]  Of the radio show saw it  And then sent us  I still have like a little reel  Somebody sent us the  You know  Back in 2001  Really  Yeah  That's good  You had one line  And it still made it in the movie  Yeah  Like  That's the  Toughest thing  You know  You do something  And most of the time  The big percentage  Gets lost and cut  Because the film's  Four hours long  Or something  But  Well done  Yeah well it was actually  You must have been  Really good  Like just two action movie guys  Talking to each other  Well you know  Here's how bad I stunk  Because I shot for an hour 
[01:21:00]  And one line made it in  I'm really good for one line  But they realize I fall apart  By line two  I'm fucking finished  Big early  Get out  Do you get to the point sometimes  Where you're just  Doing things  Because I've noticed  It takes forever  Yeah  To film stuff  It's just to move  To move one little thing around  It's like  Yeah  Oh it's  Do you ever look around  Just go  Fuck man  Let's just do this  Oh all the time  And another angle  And literally like  You can take two hours 
[01:21:30]  To reset that  And you kind of get  In the swing of it  And you go  Oh great  Now I get the scene  And we'll come back tomorrow  And finish this off  And then it's like  Tomorrow you've got to  Pick it up again  And that's the exhausting thing  I kind of love  Sort of I guess  The pace of TV  But I don't know  But I certainly prefer film  I love when they say  Turning around  Because that means  That you have so much  More time to not  I hate when the cameras roll  Because I know  I'm just going to  Fuck up and panic  I love down time  Down time is the best  Because you can't  You can't screw up  You can just hang out  And talk to people 
[01:22:00]  There's a confident actor  Right  Look at him  By the way  99% of actors  I think think that  Yeah  Oh thank god  Turning around  I didn't screw that up  They got it obviously  Because we're moving on  To the next one  That's really  Normal confirmation  That you're not being fired  Because they have to  Shoot me from the other angle too  It's panicky  It's really panicky  Acting  The more times I've done it  The more I realize  How hard it is man  I really admire good actors  It's fucking brutal  It looks easy  But it's not  Why can't you just be 
[01:22:30]  Natural  When the camera goes on  Because we all think that  They have that  Called reality TV  But it's like  Everyone thinks we're natural  That's what every person thinks  I can just be myself  And it's like  Well you're not interesting stupid  You have to play somebody else  That's the thing also  People say  Oh he's just playing himself  That's easy  That's the hardest thing to do  Because your bullshit monitor  In your own head  Is like  You don't talk like that  You don't  So you're far more critical  And then you become  So much more aware  And it's much harder  To kind of  Just relax into it  You know  Yeah  And 
[01:23:00]  I mean  It's different I think  If you're improvising  And then it's sort of  There's a looseness to it  Which most people  Can kind of get away with  But  And it's scripted  It's  You know  You're remembering that  Now deliver it  And it'll be natural  Yeah yeah  I don't know  But it  I just don't know how  It does come off  Looking natural  Because it's hard  Not to be so stiff  It's just amazing  Conscious of every  Movement of your hands  Yeah  Dumb arms  Will Farrell  Is like  What I did with my hands  That was hilarious 
[01:23:30]  Put them down  He just keeps  Bringing it up  Into shock  Well Chris  They tell you  It's not your phone  Chris has to go  Because he has  A TV and stuff  Very busy man  Did we sell the movie  Properly  I hope so  We had a great time  With Chris  I just want to make sure  People go and see the movie  In theaters today  Obviously Chris  Is a great actor  And Kristen Stewart  Is phenomenal  And so is  Charlie  I'll say this  The biggest feedback  We've got is  I think most people  Expected it to be  More of a sort of  Chick flick  But it's far more  Lord of the Rings  Than it is any sort of  Clean Disney version 
[01:24:00]  We've seen  And the biggest feedback  Has been from men  Saying shit  I didn't think  I was going to enjoy it  I loved it  It's epic  And it's gothic  And dark  And much more  Sort of what  Chris Nolan  Has sort of done  With the Batman  Or the superhero films  I think this  Is terrific  Thank you men  Very much  Thanks for coming  Thank you very much  Thanks for having me  The Opinetry Channel  Oh yeah

Mimi Beardsley, Mimi Beardsley, oh, Mimi Beardsley. 
[01:27:00]  Oh, Mimi Beardsley, oh, Mimi Beardsley, oh, Mimi Beardsley, Sirius XM, Sirius XM, yeah, this is the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, it sure is. I want to thank Chris Hemsworth for stopping by.  Fine guest.  Snow White and the Huntsman in theaters today. I heard he had a really good time, and fuck.  That guy gets laid a lot, huh? Or used to.  I think he's married now. 
[01:28:00]  Me or Chris?  Oh, you, Jimmy, of course.  It's very hard to imagine a life like that.  You know, again, not just the good looks, but that fucking Australian accent that all the chicks seem to dig.  And the movie star quality?  And the movie star thing.  And it turns out he has brothers all over the place that are movie stars, too.  Ah, that's amazing.  What has he got, two other brothers?  Oh, this mother.  Roland was telling me that his brother's in the Hunger Games.  Yeah.  And his brother's just as big as him? 
[01:28:30]  No.  Roland was saying that.  He's getting up there.  He's getting up there.  He's getting up there.  He's getting up there.  And then Jimmy had all sorts of scenarios.  Like, what was the one scenario?  I said, would you take being Chris Hemsworth, being that good looking and successful, but you had a two inch penis.  But your penis looks like from your middle knuckle of your pinky to the end of your pinky.  Oh, I meant to the elbow.  Just here. 
[01:29:00]  Oh, like you have a baby penis?  Yeah.  Like, could you take that now?  Deformed little peepee.  That's an easy one.  No fucking way.  You need a hog.  Yeah, all right.  You can get things done with a hog.  Imagine, though, you fucking wheel out with a girl.  You look like that and stuff.  And she's got to be like, oh, my God.  Oh, no.  There's nothing.  You have to tell her first.  I would have to tell her.  You know, I'm not saying I have a really, I have a wee willy.  Infantilism.  What is it called?  Infantilism.  Infantilism.  See, that scenario is easy.  What if it was like four? 
[01:29:30]  Like just below average?  Yeah.  Where it looks silly on him when he's nude.  Just small enough to look silly.  Just small enough to look silly.  But big enough to obviously be a functional penis.  Oh, wow.  So what, about a four?  Yeah, but thin.  But thin.  And rock hard so it snaps really good.  No girth, right?  No girth whatsoever.  Yeah, what do you know?  The women out there were dripping, man.  And they were losing their fucking minds because we had him on today.  What women? 
[01:30:00]  They were dripping.  Dripping.  They were dripping.  Ah, boy.  That's a, you know what?  He was cool.  Gotta take the cock.  You gotta go with the hog, right?  Yeah, isolate that one.  You gotta go with the hog.  You gotta go with the hog.  Yeah, you probably do.  That's easy.  That's an easy one.  Yeah.  All right.  Go with the hog.  Yeah.  He was also in Cabin in the Woods.  Was that a good movie?  I heard it was.  What happened? 
[01:30:30]  People liked Chris Hemsworth in Cabin in the Woods, too.  Oh.  Wow.  Who farted?  Jimmy?  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  You're the go-to fart guy.  Someone farted.  I don't smell you.  It's kind of sour.  Was it you, Roland?  Oh, God.  Jesus.  Fucking Roland.  I was scared.  You're not scared.  Oh, fuck Roland.  Man.  Jesus.  That's a bad one.  Man.  Hey, none of us have seen The Avengers, right?  You haven't seen it?  Jimmy, you haven't seen it. 
[01:31:00]  No.  You've seen it, Sam?  Yeah.  I want to see it.  How do I get an illegal copy?  Why don't you just go to the movie?  Well, first of all, ask your door, man.  Shh.  I saw...  That wasn't supposed to happen.  You put him on the air.  I saw Prometheus.  Fuck.  Yeah?  That is...  You did?  Yeah.  It is so fucking good.  How did you see it?  I didn't see it.  People were like...  I looked down.  It's like, what?  I didn't see it.  It looks great, though.  Fucking God damn.  I want to see that the second it comes out. 
[01:31:30]  That's a movie I'm going to go to the movie theater for.  Yes.  What time are you going to go?  Are you going to go on like a Sunday morning to avoid a crowd?  No.  I think I'm going to get a crowd experience.  I haven't had one in a while.  I think I'm going to go in a packed movie theater experience.  You're probably going to be very careful about the community the theater is in, though.  You know what?  Yeah?  I don't care.  Yeah?  I'm going to go amongst the people.  Good for you. 
[01:32:00]  What?  There's a screening coming up.  When?  Next week.  At the gang-related movie theaters?  No, like their private screening room.  Private screening room?  Are you kidding?  No.  Dude, that I would go to.  What movie, buddy?  Prometheus.  Because that girl knew me wanting to come in.  Isn't Charlize Theron in that, too?  Yeah.  Yeah, she's in a couple of hit movies.  She looks good as the ice queen in this Snow White movie.  I see that bitch all the time.  With those icy blue eyes.  Restaurants.  And they're making it dark.  Nice.  Oh.  You were basically telling that I laughed awkwardly there because you were asking Chris Hemsworth 
[01:32:30]  if they used real people for the dwarfs.  And I think what you were getting at were...  Actual.  I know, but it was funny how you said it.  And I wanted to call you out on it.  Like midgets who aren't real people.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  That's what I was doing.  Great.  That's very funny.  Yeah, you're like, do they use real people or, you said, and then he started answering  the question.  Yeah.  Mattel is the funniest joke about the word little people.  I hate David.  So...  Oh, he's brilliant.  Yeah.  God damn it.  What's his...  Yeah, what's the line?  What's his joke? 
[01:33:00]  All right.  I shouldn't do it, but...  Little people.  They want to be called little people.  Hey, if they're people, that elevates the rest of us to gods.  What he does with that...  God.  He is fucking funny.  God.  I can't watch him.  Oh, God.  He's so goddamn good.  I can't watch Dave.  He is fucking funny, man.  Does he make up shit on the stage sometimes?  Oh, constantly.  He also, I think, writes a lot, but yes.  So brave.  He's so good, man.  So brave to just fucking make up shit as you're going along. 
[01:33:30]  He's a gifted guy.  Colin, too.  I was watching some of Colin.  Yeah, Colin's great.  His hunk on the new Secret Service, a bit about...  Oh, he's got to think about that.  Of course he does.  Why wouldn't he?  Why wouldn't he?  Motherfucker.  The angle.  I'm not even going to blow the angle he goes, but it's such a smart, funny angle.  Colin always is...  He's a very smart guy.  That annoys me.  But his comedy is fucking...  We've got to get Colin in here.  Yeah, he hasn't been in in a while.  It's been a while.  I saw him last night.  Yeah.  Remember when he used to just roll onto the show from, like... 
[01:34:00]  Oh, when he'd walk in?  Slippers on?  Yeah, looking like grandpa.  Slippers.  Slippers.  Yeah, slip it all over.  No.  Yeah, he didn't slip.  Jesus, Chip.  We met him because he was on his way to OTV.  That's how it all started with us.  We were outside NAW.  He's like, oh, you're old Pete Anthony.  Been on the nag.  I'd like to come on your show, but...  Yeah.  Like, oh, Colin Quinn.  But he went across the street to that old OTV joint.  Yeah.  The good old days, right?  That's what they're saying.  They miss those days. 
[01:34:30]  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  We all miss those days.  Don't we all miss the good old days?  Now we just got to chatter.  Now we just chatter for four straight hours.  A little chatter.  Instead of having bruds and such.  You know who's going to miss the good old days?  Sam Roberts.  You're obsessed with his wedding.  It's really strange.  I am.  Why are you obsessed with his wedding?  People are excited about it.  I'm excited.  I can't wait to go.  It'll be a good time.  But Anthony's obsessed.  His excitement is manifesting itself.  He doesn't want to see you happy.  No, he does.  No, he doesn't.  He's excited about the wedding, and it's manifesting himself in venom.  Because it brings up something in him. 
[01:35:00]  He doesn't want to see you happy.  No, you know your marriage.  It's true.  And you said yourself.  Yeah, you went into it knowing it was going to suck.  Yeah, I did.  I know a lot of marriages fail, but you went into yours knowing it was going to fail.  I know, knowing it was going to fail.  See, most people don't do that.  From day fucking zero.  See.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, but you know, I was just telling Sam that things change after marriage, and  you've got to set the fucking rules in place right when you get married. 
[01:35:30]  Let her know, like Ralph Kramden says, that you're the boss.  We live a comfortable lifestyle together already.  Right after I said, I do, I said, I'm the boss.  You did.  That's what you do.  Just let her know.  Yeah, yeah, let her know right away.  And weekly weigh-ins.  Because wives have a tendency, get a little, you know, they get a little comfortable, let's  say.  Well, she takes a lot of pride in her appearance.  That goes away.  It does. 
[01:36:00]  Because then they got the guy.  They roped the guy in.  Now, you know, they could get a little comfortable.  Which, in comfort, comes the pounds.  So you weigh him, you give him a fucking, you know, like in a casino.  I guess I never assumed that she was trying to keep herself in good shape because a stud  like me might run away from her.  That is true.  Sam understands what a non-catch he is.  Sam sort of knows he's got a little...  I have to work hard.  There's a little luck involved here. 
[01:36:30]  Sam's a driven four.  That's exactly right.  Yes.  She's an eight and a half, nine.  Sam's a driven four.  Yeah.  That would give her a higher number, but that would go into looking disrespectfully at  her body.  Right.  That's true.  Are you the short end of the stick there?  In the relationship?  Yeah.  Personality-wise?  Or just...  Just overall?  Yeah.  Yes.  What are you going to do for the wedding as far as your appearance goes?  Are you changing anything?  No.  Are you going to wax the brows?  No.  Are you going to cut the hair? 
[01:37:00]  Although she did see a hair.  She left an eyebrow, like a little eyebrow scissor clipper with a post-it that said, trim  your eyebrows.  See?  Are you going to?  No.  I mean...  Just trim them.  They don't have to be that bushy.  I might check for some stray hairs, but beyond that, no.  See?  And let me tell you something.  Trim your eyebrows.  She left them a gun.  Can we do it with a weed whacker?  Be a good radio bitch the day before your wedding.  And this is before the wedding, and she's leaving you notes about your eyebrows. 
[01:37:30]  You know how fucking quickly that turns to, trim those fucking eyebrows.  I'm not going to be seen with the likes of that shit.  That's right.  That's why the precedent is being set now.  She will see me at the altar with my eyebrows appearing as they always do.  Oh, boy.  And my hair appearing as it always does.  She's going to just get mad at you.  So we don't have to dress up for this wedding, obviously.  If you're going, you're going like you.  Well, I'm going to have a nice, a very nice suit on.  A suit that you're going to wear for other weddings.  And I'm going to look like a million bucks at all of them.  A million bucks.  Guess where my suit is for my wedding. 
[01:38:00]  Where?  I don't know.  That's why he wanted you to guess.  I don't know.  I don't know.  You wear it once.  But you've got cash like that, okay?  No, you wear it once.  What about renting a tux?  A really nice tux?  No.  They got nice tuxes now.  If you get a nice suit, then you can wear it many times.  You shouldn't have...  You should have the best suit in the whole place.  I believe I will.  Uh, is it Armani?  No, it's not Armani.  Hi, mine's Armani.  It's Hickey Friedman.  So what are you going to do?  Hickey what? 
[01:38:30]  A Hickey what now?  Hickey Friedman.  You're going to like the way you look.  No, it's not men's warehouse.  Men's warehouse.  You see his new commercial where he's in the car?  He's driving, talking all deep.  With that voice.  Somebody tweeted something once where he said his tagline sounds slightly threatening.  You're going to like the way you look.  Oh, no shit.  I guarantee it.  He's going for a mafia thing, I think.  Yeah, I think he is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You got a Hickey Friedman?  A Hickey Friedman?  It's a very, very good brand.  Very upscale.  It's not Armani. 
[01:39:00]  What's Hickey mean?  An Armani suit.  I think it's probably two last names.  It's like an old school brand.  Did he play with the Grateful Dead or something?  No.  Hickey Friedman.  Look at this.  I'll give you my Armani suit, but I want two dinners.  Look at the handsome guy.  From Mendy's.  That's that guy.  Look at that.  He's a guy.  He's an actor.  Tailored clothing.  What?  Look at these suits.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, God.  This looks like a cheap fucking Sears ad.  Jesus.  All right.  You need a few bucks.  Shark shit.  Okay, yeah.  Cheap ad.  Look at this one.  You need a few bucks. 
[01:39:30]  Why don't you get this mahogany sport coat?  It cost $1,095.  How much does your suit cost?  I don't know.  Pops paid for that.  Oh, God.  His father pays for that.  No, no.  Oh, my God.  I've had discussions with Sam Roberts' father.  He makes Sam pay for everything.  Yeah.  What?  There's some kind of...  Fuck yeah, man.  There are Excel documents somewhere monitoring every penny that was spent on his wedding.  Sam's parents do not dish out money to Sam Roberts.  Now, doesn't Jess's family have to foot the bill for the wedding? 
[01:40:00]  No.  Is that how it works?  What?  I mean, that is a sort of...  That is the tradition, right?  I guess it's tradition, but that's a little old school.  What?  We split it.  We went Dutch on this bad boy.  Why?  What do you mean, why?  Why not have the traditional...  Not so traditional these days.  Pride's family pays.  That's not so traditional these days.  That's why your father's fucking keeping tabs on all the money.  Yeah, he wasn't happy about it.  He loved the tradition.  Yeah, he loved the tradition. 
[01:40:30]  He wanted to go very...  Oh, he's a chiseler, your father.  Oh, he's a cheap skate.  He's obsessed OCD with money.  He knows where every dollar is going.  Every penny.  And he wants to make sure Sam understands the value of a dollar.  He was also very generous, and it was very unexpected when he offered to pay for the  suit.  I think my mother probably pushed him to it, but it was very generous of him to do that.  Penny saved is a penny earned.  He has a fucking handlebar muster.  She had to bully him into it.  Oh, yeah.  She put on the special belt.  And taught him a lesson in his rump. 
[01:41:00]  I like Sam's father.  I do, too.  I like him more now.  I have to think of that.  I like him a lot, actually.  I like Sam's mom, too, but she just laughs the whole time, so I don't really have conversations  with her.  Oh, this is going to be unique now.  I'm going to get to meet...  Oh, you've never met the family at all.  The Roberts...  Yeah.  Did you meet the father?  You've met my dad.  Yes.  I met your dad.  Because he walked in that time well after you stopped dating Joe.  And he knew that.  Oh, right.  But he wanted an awkward moment.  So he said, hey, where's the traffic girl?  Yes. 
[01:41:30]  Yes.  That bastard.  You're going to have to pay him back for that one.  He's the son of a bitch.  Yeah.  Be like, hey, so your queer son's getting married.  Good one.  Well, I'll think of something.  Yeah.  You got time.  Maybe Chip could write it for me.  What's that?  I'll write anything you need.  You need jokes?  I'm jokes galore.  Trust me.  My suit is going to look like a million bucks.  It's going to look really nice.  Oh, my God.  Is there?  Okay.  Open bar.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  That's not a problem.  Yeah.  All right.  Drink to your heart's content.  Are you bringing a lady? 
[01:42:00]  I'm marrying one.  Ah, you.  That's very funny.  I'm marrying one.  Of course I am.  Me and Ann are going up together alone in the limo.  And we're just going to jerk each other off in our suits.  We're both.  We walk out with cum stains all over.  Just pre-cum all over the front of our black trousers.  Ann and Jim are acting weird.  Toothpaste.  Yeah, toothpaste.  I'm walking in a black light.  Don't we have to end the show early today so we can get up there?  Oh. 
[01:42:30]  I mean, no.  Are you sure?  I'm going to do the after show.  So if you leave, Jess isn't happy about that.  But if you leave straight from here.  Why are you doing the after show today?  You do the after show.  We could have got out of here at 9 o'clock.  We can't.  Not happy about you.  What the fuck?  Your eyebrows.  Your fucking schedule.  I can see what happens.  She's happy about me.  Why are you doing the stupid after show a day before your wedding?  Because if people want to hear a show, we can give them a show.  You're getting married tomorrow.  You're getting married tomorrow.  Right.  You fucking chill out for a day.  Sam's a dedicated guy. 
[01:43:00]  What he lacks in talent, he makes up for in his ability to be on the air.  Right.  His willingness to sit here.  There's an OCD thing there.  There's some weird OCD fucking thing.  Yes, there is.  You're like when I used to do spots.  I would do a few a night the same way.  It's good, though, to be that way.  It gets you into good habits.  I'm never going to get good unless I just keep doing it.  Even if you keep doing it.  And I booked the limo so I can leave whenever I want.  That's right.  I can just go home.  Stay for a couple of songs.  I'm starting to get the feeling. 
[01:43:30]  He really doesn't want to go to your wedding.  Oh, my God.  He's making it very clear to everybody.  Yesterday, you and Eric both said you didn't think he was going to go.  You said you didn't think he was going to go.  I don't know.  You gave 70-30 odds.  70-30 odds.  I still don't think he's going.  Do you still give it the same odds?  No.  Everything's booked.  Like the limo's booked.  He's got to get through Friday night.  We'll see how Friday night is.  That is true.  You're right.  I don't know if he's going.  I could sleep in the limo.  I don't care.  I still think that odds are good he's not going to show.  No, no, no.  Okay.  Still 70-30?  I'll go 60-40 now that I know you've got a limo.  No, I'll be a good boy.  So it's getting close to 50-50. 
[01:44:00]  I'll be a good boy tonight.  I'm not going to get completely fucking wasted.  You can get all fucked up at the wedding, though.  I'll be all hungover.  No, I hate that.  I'll get all fucking tooled at the wedding.  Yeah.  Hell yeah.  I'm going to be fucking playing grab-ass with your fucking old lady relatives.  I'll play grab-ass with your mom.  My mom.  Like, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Like, come up behind her, just pinch her ass.  She'll be like, oh, and I'll laugh at her, right?  And then just cup her vag with my hand.  And squeeze it angrily while looking at her in the eye.  Oh, God.  Fucking bite your lip.  Maybe don't drink. 
[01:44:30]  I'll just grab her vag, squeeze it hard, and then look at your dad and go,  Traffic girl, huh?  Where's the traffic girl?  Here she is.  Funny, right?  Funny?  Nah.  Funny.  Why so aggressive?  Just conceptually.  Why so aggressive?  I was actually looking at her.  So it's a double combination.  I think at some level he's looking, but he can't admit that he thinks it could be a good time.  Yes, for some reason, Ant doesn't want to show nice guy Ant. 
[01:45:00]  He has to be like, I'm a fucking dick.  I'm very excited that I will be.  I'm a fucking dick, Ant.  Why are you doing that?  Is it that or?  No, is it that or?  I'm confused.  Is it that anything that interferes with Ant's addictive behavior?  That is true.  He kind of hesitates with, but he likes Sam and wants to go.  That's true.  I think Ant is out of the ordinary stuff.  I like ordinary.  But the bits have been a lot of fun.  Don't get me wrong.  But there's something going on in Ted here.  It's fun radio.  You're very aggressive over Sam's wedding.  But if it was true, I would call him after the show and be like,  Ah, you getting married? 
[01:45:30]  What the fuck?  Dude, let me talk to you.  I forget all this shit once I'm in my truck.  My perception of Ant has always been that he's very secretly supportive,  but he doesn't want to tell.  He doesn't want anybody to know.  He doesn't like showing that side.  The clan of the white supremacists.  The Aryans.  He doesn't like showing that side.  Very supportive.  But that's fine.  I don't mind that.  Yeah.  You know, I'll wish you two the best of luck.  And during my toast, I will say that. 
[01:46:00]  Can I tap the glass?  And be like,  Everyone, I want you to raise your glass.  How horrified would you be?  I'm all drunk.  And I start doing that fucking clink, clink, clink, clink on the glass.  Yeah.  And everybody looks over like,  Oh, why, why?  And I go,  Ladies and gentlemen,  I want you all to stand.  And then my rattlesnakes are going,  That's Anthony from the show.  That's Anthony.  Oh, he's doing his speech.  That's Anthony.  He'll probably talk about this on the air.  You know, this little fuckwad.  Oh, no.  Oh, the people would be like,  Oh, no.  No.  Eastside Dave would be laughing.  Falling on the floor. 
[01:46:30]  Because he does that.  That's what he does.  You'll end your speech with,  And now Eastside Dave wants to say something.  Let's burn this motherfucker down!  Yeah.  Hey, everyone.  Guess what's in my asshole?  And then he pulls out like the fucking top of the cake.  You two.  When do you think Eastside Dave's going to do something really awkwardly stupid?  I think you'll be...  How long will he last?  Because we all know he will do something stupid.  Ow.  Oh.  Speaking of stupid.  Oh, Jimmy.  Yeah.  What was that?  Your arm is stretched and pushed the light. 
[01:47:00]  He's just doing the skyhook to get a thing in the garbage can.  And it got blocked.  I don't think Dave will fuck anything up at the reception.  I think if we do like an after party or whatever, he might fuck some shit up there.  Wow, are you naive?  I had a half hour long conversation with Dave on the phone about the wedding.  Yeah.  First of all, he wanted to know if I was going because he was going to be bummed if I wasn't  going because he wants to hang out and drink with Mr. C.  Mr. C.  He loves Mr. C.  Who was me.  And then he's like amazed that people really think he's going to fuck around at the wedding. 
[01:47:30]  He's like, no, I'm not going to do that.  You know.  I don't think he is.  No, I don't think he will either.  But he'll have fun.  He can't help himself.  Thank you.  Because he is a raging alcoholic with just no inhibitions once he starts drinking.  Yeah, but he'll also like, he'll get all drunk and then he'll come over to me and be  emotional.  He's like, Sammy, Sammy, I wanted to set something on fire, Sammy, but I'm not going to do that  to you.  Not at your wedding.  I'm not going to do it here.  And then he'll start yelling at me.  Drinks, Mr. C.  What are you having?  He will take his pants down.  Maybe. 
[01:48:00]  He'll probably take his pants down, but that's to be expected.  He's going to do something stupid before the official end of the wedding.  I'm not talking after party.  Hmm.  Wow.  And he doesn't intend to.  Like, I think it might take his pants down or something.  All right, that's stupid.  Okay, yeah.  Most people wouldn't appreciate that at a wedding.  Most people wouldn't.  Most people wouldn't appreciate that.  I would laugh a little.  Boxer shorts, it's okay.  That's funny.  No, he'll take his boxers down, too.  Jockey's a little creepy, but he will go full up.  He'll try to stick his penis in the wedding cake.  Oh, that'd be funny, right? 
[01:48:30]  But he didn't mean to.  Because he keeps going.  All this he didn't mean to.  I get it.  Because Dave gets laughs, but then he keeps going until it's just horror.  Right.  Right.  Like, he can't just let the laughs be there.  That could be his mistake sometimes.  Right.  Like, he gets laughs.  He gets the big laughs.  He pulls his pants down and gets laughs.  And then he's like, oh, more laughs?  And he pulls his underwear down.  He doesn't know.  He's like, what can I do with my dick?  He starts jerking off.  And everyone's like, what are you doing, dude?  Oh, God, yes.  Kenny has to remove him.  Come on, Dave.  Didn't he eat a piece of shit on our show? 
[01:49:00]  Oh, yeah, he did.  When we were in that shit humor stage for a while.  He ate his own shit.  He ate his own shit.  Then he showed up at your bachelor party at your brother's restaurant.  Oh, my brother almost beat the shit out of him.  Yeah, because he pulled his pants down and started dripping hot wax on his balls in the  middle of the table.  And your brother was pissed.  He was throwing shit at him.  He's like, get the fuck off that table.  My brother was not happy.  And that was a situation where he said Dave didn't mean to do anything.  No.  He just can't help himself.  He thought he was being a funny guy.  So he might want to be a funny guy at the wedding. 
[01:49:30]  He might.  I'll keep an eye on him.  Yeah, but you're a horrible influence.  I'm going to egg him on.  And that was actually when I was doing the tables.  I was like, well, if I put Dave at their table, on one end, he may not try to be a  complete asshole because he'll know that's Mr. C and Opie and Jim.  But on the other end.  He knows I love it.  He may want to show off.  Mr. C will be.  He's going to show off.  And Opie is also a bad Eastside Dave instigator.  I retweet all his videos because they're hilarious when he's yelling and falling down. 
[01:50:00]  You're an asshole.  Why?  Don't put me in this.  I'm going to be well behaved at your wedding.  All right.  I don't know why you're obsessing.  I will, too.  I'm going to be a problem, too.  I will, too.  I'll just use Dave to do my bidding.  Yeah.  I'm going to sit right next to Dave, too.  So me and him are just fucking going to be like pounding drinks.  And then I might, you know, I might whisper in his ear a few things.  Hey, Dave, what do you say?  Get a load of this, Dave.  What, Mr. C?  What, what, what, Mr. C? 
[01:50:30]  And he takes your, you go, that would be funny.  And he's like, wow, Mr. C knows funny.  Yeah.  And then he does it.  And then he looks over at me and I'm just laughing like, yeah, this is great.  And then he goes too far and you're already at the door in your limo.  And I'm in the limo driving home and everything's safe.  And that's it.  Yeah.  Love it.  Can someone help me with an Instagram filter?  I'm trying to, I'm trying to make Chris Hemsworth look really ugly through Instagram.  You're going to put it through the Norton filter.  Norton filter.  It moves the chin, adds tits.  Where do I go?  And makes the penis semi-functional. 
[01:51:00]  Semi-functional.  Swim walk.  I can't tweak this picture until I can ugly him up a little bit.  Yeah.  I might have to go Kelvin.  Good luck.  Kelvin.  Kelvin?  Kelvin's a bad filter, man.  Yeah.  That's a very interesting thing.  I'm going to go Kelvin with a little fucking blur.  Because in Star Trek, by the way.  They used Kelvin.  He was on the ship.  He was the ship, not ship.  The ship, the Kelvin.  Really?  In the Star Trek movie.  So I go Kelvin filter. 
[01:51:30]  Yes.  I got to ugly this guy up, man.  Yeah.  Good luck.  That guy's a handsome gentleman.  E-Rock just sent me the picture of me and Chris Hemsworth.  Yeah.  I'll be posting that.  You know, I was thinking that, too.  Get the fuck out of here.  And E-Rock gave me the picture immediately because, you know.  Yeah.  He wanted to rub it in.  Of course.  Usually takes days to get these pictures.  Guess what?  E-Rock immediately.  I got a picture with Chris Hemsworth and it's on my phone 30 seconds later.  That was E-Rock saying, hey, ugly fuckers.  Look at this.  Yes.  Of course.  Is he on Twitter, Chris Hemsworth? 
[01:52:00]  No.  I don't think he is.  Why would he be?  Why would you be?  He doesn't have to be.  Twitter's a dating service.  He's too handsome.  He's also going to be on there.  What is he?  He doesn't need to be on there.  Hey, everybody.  Thor here.  Oh, boy.  That's what I would do.  He's not at Thor?  Oh, God.  Who's got at Thor?  God damn it.  Roland, you're going to have to leave the studio.  No, that's him.  It's not me.  It's Roland.  That was a Jimmy fart.  I know the difference.  Oh, my God.  I do know the difference.  That's why I was a little confused by the last one.  But it came from all the way over there.  That's pretty potent. 
[01:52:30]  Wow.  That is brutal.  Oh, the gay thing, yeah.  Oh, the gay thing.  The New York court thing.  Yeah, that it's not slanderous.  To falsely call someone gay.  Right.  I think you're right.  If they're not gay.  I believe you're right now.  You could say, hey, that guy's gay.  And in New York, they're not going to slap you with a slander charge.  The mid-level appeal court in Albany, New York, has ruled that it's no longer slander  to falsely describe someone as gay.  I'm surprised it worked out this way, right? 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  How PC everything's getting.  Well, but it makes sense because of how PC things are.  Not seen as an insult.  Because it's not seen as an insult.  Wow.  That's not negative.  It's not something that anyone should be embarrassed by.  So that's why it's not considered.  However, that will be challenged in other places.  And good luck.  Now, there's a precedent for it.  But good luck doing that one in fucking Georgia.  Or somewhere else.  And again, you can still be sued.  You have to pay the ticket.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:53:30]  It used to be if you called someone gay or lesbian, there was sufficient grounds for slander.  Oh.  It's no longer the case because gay is no longer seen by society as negative.  I think it is seen by society as negative still.  Yeah.  That's the political correctness that comes into play.  Right.  Where it's like, oh, it's not seen as negative.  No, it is.  It is.  There's more open-minded people.  That's why people ain't flying out of the closet every fucking two seconds.  If I think in general, it's still seen by society as negative.  Yeah.  I really do.  Yes. 
[01:54:00]  Case concerning a man from Broome County.  Mark, who sued after being called gay because it hurt his relationship with a girlfriend.  Justice Thomas Merker ruled that there has been a tremendous evolution of social attitudes about homosexuality.  True.  That judge is gay, I think.  And concomitant.  What?  Is that how you say that word?  I've never seen that word before in my life.  What's the word?  C-O-N-C-O-M-I-T-A-N-T.  Hold on.  I have to see it.  Concomitant. 
[01:54:30]  Where is it?  Concomitant.  I've never seen that word.  What does it mean?  Oh, I don't know.  Concomitant?  Concomitant?  Homosexuality and the concomitant increase in gay rights.  I'm going to guess progressive or continued.  Yes.  Nice.  C-O-N.  Someone knows their way around a thesaurus.  Wow.  Incorrect.  What?  Concurring.  Incorrect.  Concurring?  Yes.  Naturally accompanying or associated.  Oh, really?  All right.  Well, okay, so kind of progressing.  No.  Concomitant increase in gay rights gave sufficient grounds to overturn previous rulings. 
[01:55:00]  Your concomitant remarks are driving me crazy.  Oh.  That's not the correct use.  Yeah, it is.  Or maybe if it's common, it wants to jail.  Double guns, motherfuckers.  You evolved into Chip for that joke.  Oh, boy.  He's a concomitant.  I just received a text from Eastside Dave McDonald.  Oh, boy.  Breaking news.  I've bottled some Molotov cocktails for this thing.  This barn is going to look like a prop from Mississippi Burning. 
[01:55:30]  Yee-haw.  Yee-haw.  That's not good.  He's all set.  You've got to put a man on Eastside Dave.  Let me tell you, Dave.  The whole time he's there.  I am with you.  Me and you are finally going to hang.  It's been quite a while.  We're going to get some fucking beverages in us.  And we are going to have a good goddamn time.  Well, you can have a good time without being destructive.  Yeah?  How?  At a wedding?  That's right.  I don't know about that.  I'm going to...  What do I got?  The beef?  Chicken?  What do I got?  I think you got beef.  I got chicken. 
[01:56:00]  Nice.  You got chicken.  What are you?  You probably got beef.  Nice.  Right now, Dave's just dancing around his house.  Welcome to the jungle.  I wonder if I can hire Kenny for the wedding.  Oh, wow.  You want him on the clock, huh?  He's going to be at the table anyway.  That's true.  Dave, please.  Oh, that's good.  We could slow dance, me and Dave.  That would be embarrassing, right?  And we just open mouth, make out kiss in the middle of the dance floor?  I would like that.  Or when you guys are supposed to do your first dance, me and Dave get up and just wreck 
[01:56:30]  it by doing a dance and making out.  And then we just start fucking, before everybody else gets invited.  No, how about you go out there and you go like,  Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.  I have got a pair of wood to juice, pretty wood to juice, little wood to juice.  Oh, my God, how embarrassing.  Living out the fantasy that you wanted to play on your sister all over yourself. 
[01:57:00]  It'll be silently humiliated for you.  I think he's trying to be funny.  Jesse and me would stop dancing and just look at you.  I'd just ruin the dance.  And then is it going to be a daddy's little girl dance?  I think we're doing parents' dances, yeah.  Yeah?  I think so.  So she's going to dance with her dad?  What if I come sliding in with just my socks on on the floor?  So I slide and take the father out with a cross-body block?  It would be inappropriate.  Oh, yeah.  And then I get up and go like, yeah, motherfucker! 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, that's crazy.  Still, I don't think you'd get the reaction that you wanted.  Me would.  Maybe from you.  Everyone would laugh at our table.  I'll be good.  Opie and Kenny wouldn't laugh.  They got my back.  I'm pretty mellow at weddings.  No, I'm still going to laugh.  I'm just going to behave.  I'm going to behave.  I'm going to laugh at stuff.  That's encouraging.  Are you going to have an honorary table for Virgil at your wedding?  Can you do that, please?  One of the fans.  I can't remember.  I wish I remembered his Twitter name.  Some fan sent me an autographed Virgil picture that said, 
[01:58:00]  To Sam, have a great marriage from Virgil.  No way.  Yeah, it's real.  He sent me a picture of meeting him and everything.  Wow.  That's a cool little gift.  I'm going to put that photo at the gift table, I think.  Nice.  That reminds me.  I got packing.  Damn.  LonelyVirgil.tumblr.com is, by the way, in big business right now.  Oh.  Hey, is there internet at this place?  I don't know.  In a wireless?  Wi-Fi.  Wi-Fi?  Why do you need it at the Saturday?  Yeah, can I do a compound show from the table? 
[01:58:30]  No, absolutely not.  I think I might want to do a compound show from the table.  It'd be fun, though, right?  No.  Just set up some cameras, fucking intrude on your private fucking great moment.  That wouldn't be fun at all.  On your fucking life moment, just make a mockery of it on PalTalk or live from the compound.  No, don't do that.  How bad would that be?  Man, it doesn't want to go.  He wants to go.  I just quietly, like, I show the ceremony and everything, but I put my mouth right by  the microphone. 
[01:59:00]  I go, look at this fucking dick.  Oh, how horrible would that be?  Ant can't admit that he can have a good time at, like, a nice event.  He feels like he has been forced to go to your wedding.  He's not forced.  Listen, listen.  Yeah, I'm not forced.  He keeps bringing it up.  Oh, it'd be great, you know, just fucking go to this place in Connecticut instead of  hanging by my pool.  He's not forced.  That's a real thought right there.  You know why?  Because there's plenty of weekends during a summer.  There's so many weekends.  You've not, dude.  It's limited.  Oh, Jimmy.  You didn't have to go.  You chose.  You know, you sent me an invitation. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah, you kind of emotionally blackmailed him into going.  You can go to Than's wedding.  I didn't go to E-Rox either.  I know.  I didn't want to bring it up because he's right there.  How come you didn't go to E-Rox?  The poor kid's running soon.  I think I was busy.  Why don't you like you?  Surely.  When was it?  When's your anniversary?  November 19th.  Yeah.  Oh, November 19th.  You were busy at that.  That was what?  How long ago?  2010.  Oh, right, right, right.  And it was a Friday.  I remember that.  I was, uh, I think I was in, um, I was out of the country. 
[02:00:00]  You interviewed Zach Levi.  That's why you told me, he's like, well, you have to stay because this interview was  so important.  Chuck?  What?  Zach Levi.  He was at night?  What?  Oh.  The fuck are you talking about?  What happened?  You're like, what are you talking about?  Who is this bitch?  That Friday when we, when most of us took off.  I didn't take off and I still went to the wedding.  It was at night.  The show's in the morning.  I didn't take off either.  What happened?  You did take off.  I did not.  Yes, you did.  Yeah, you did.  I did not.  Opie did not take off.  Thank you, Sam. 
[02:00:30]  I did not take off.  Oh, I almost remember this.  Yeah.  I got to go home to get ready for your wedding.  I can't believe you're staying until 11.  It's all good.  You can't go home using the wedding as an excuse when the groom isn't going to be going  home.  Yeah, that's why I'm so mad at him today.  He really did screw the pooch for everybody.  You haven't learned shit from us.  It's all good.  You haven't learned shit.  It's all good.  You take advantage when you can.  No.  It's a show.  You're doing a show for the people.  Why you haven't even seen bosses in weeks?  Because they're all panicking if they're going to be part of the new company. 
[02:01:00]  Is that why?  Yeah, this is a perfect opportunity to take advantage.  No, it's all good.  So instead of going home early, even, he's staying and doing the after show until 11.  But I'm missing four shows next week.  Wow.  What's that, one day?  You're getting married.  You're getting married.  I'm missing four days.  That shouldn't even be a thought in your head.  Yeah.  I'm back on Friday, though.  This marriage is becoming an inconvenience to your radio career, isn't it?  Yeah, I didn't want to.  I didn't like this.  I was annoyed.  There were a lot of fights.  Jess wanted a long two-week honeymoon. 
[02:01:30]  They'll forget about you here.  I said it was completely unnecessary.  To spend two weeks on vacation.  Oh, man.  It's completely unnecessary to be with you for two weeks.  With your new bride in some nice locale.  Yeah, that's crazy.  Fucking without condoms.  What is wrong with you?  You can do that wherever you are.  Wow.  You're heading toward therapy.  You know that.  It's going to take a few more years, but you'll get there.  I need therapy.  You're going to need it.  Jeez.  You've got some weird thoughts on that head.  How many people at this wedding?  Under 200. 
[02:02:00]  That's a nice number.  That's a good number, yeah.  More your side or her side?  Probably more my side because we've got a big family and then a lot of work people.  What?  There's three SiriusXM tables.  Plus a table of reference from home.  Oh, my God.  I invited two people from here.  Wait a minute.  Three SiriusXM tables.  We know who's at the star table.  There's the star table, yeah.  Then we know who's at the secondary table.  Who's the likes of your Iraq?  Wait, who's at the secondary table?  Secondary table is E-Rock, Troy, Roland, Troy, Roland. 
[02:02:30]  Who else?  And then Stinky.  Nice.  Stinky should be at our table, by the way.  And then Monica, who's been on the show before.  She's the voice of the issue.  We're going to try to get her hooked up with Troy and his chick.  Nice.  Oh, is that the game plan?  See if we can figure that out.  Wow.  Is that the whole second table?  Yeah, pretty much.  Roland's bringing a date.  Friday the morning mashup?  We have to fucking socialize with those people?  Oh, good.  I'll be happy to see those guys.  The entire mashup is invited?  Yes.  And they all said yes?  The entire mashup and Mikey Piff, who's the producer.  Who's that one guy that walks around?  I don't know his name.  Ryan.  Oh, Ryan. 
[02:03:00]  Is he going to be there?  He gets so mad.  Well, because he gets so mad, and I swear I still don't know his name.  It's not even a bit.  You go Rich, Nicole, and Stan.  Ryan is there, too.  He does the weather and stuff.  Gary?  Gary?  Steve Blatter?  Steve Blatter?  They didn't get invited.  Nice.  Nice.  Not even an invite, huh?  No.  Wow.  That makes a statement.  Why were you afraid they might have said yes?  They were going to get invited.  Oh, man.  Because they don't treat them right.  Yeah.  They make believe they do.  That's what they're going to do.  No, they want to know. 
[02:03:30]  Actually, they think they treat you right.  But the fact is, they don't, and that's what you're saying to them.  I like that.  They were on the original rough list.  Yeah.  They didn't make the cut.  Yeah, you got to cut people out.  Good for you, man.  Too many people.  Yeah, no, they didn't make it.  What about Jess's side?  Like, was there anybody on the air that you were like, oh, fuck?  Um, no, I like all her friends.  Oh, no, you don't.  You couldn't.  They're all good people.  No, you don't.  You got to say that. 
[02:04:00]  We understand.  And she's not bringing that many people from work.  Good.  Why would you?  Wait, who's at the third?  Yeah.  That's the mashup table.  Oh.  They get their own table.  There's four plus dates plus Mikey Piff.  That's nine people.  Jesus.  I don't want to fucking socialize with them.  Now I got a problem.  Thank God they're at their own table.  And I separate.  There's a buffer table between you guys and the mashup.  Thank you, Sam.  Lots of buffers.  It goes, ONA staff, ONA talent, friends from New Row, New Rochelle. 
[02:04:30]  Oh, no, your dumb friends from New Rochelle.  They're going to be so starstruck.  The New Row guys are all right.  One person comes up and asks me for a fucking picture.  Limo is just peeling out of that parking lot.  I don't care what time it is.  We'll all hear like little flecks of fucking gravel hitting the window from the limo.  Just fucking leaving.  You got to beg Anthony not to do that.  Why?  He wanted you to beg.  Please don't leave.  And you know what I found out?  You know what I found out? 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  DJ.  The DJ's a big ONA fan.  Oh, great.  He didn't know I worked for the show until like last week.  That'll be great.  One comment up, hey, any of you guys want to come up here and do this for a while?  Make sure he doesn't do that shit.  I will.  I told him.  It's not a show event.  Want to say hi?  You know, got a few people here I want to say hello to.  Good thing things went okay in the church.  Oh, boy.  Jess is worried.  She had to tell my dad when he's marrying us not to do any show references. 
[02:05:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, really?  He wants to, right?  He wanted to.  No, he looked at her like, no, I'm not going to do any show references while I'm marrying you.  But he's also...  He might do your mom's box or something.  He's a son of a bitch, so he might...  He is a son of a bitch.  Yeah, he's going to fucking...  Family weddings, though.  I always got one relative who goes, hey, why don't you go up there and show him how it's done?  You're a DJ, too, right?  Show him how it's done, huh?  Do you like that?  Every fucking wedding.  Did anyone do that at your wedding?  No, because we had the band.  Oh, that's right.  Did I have a DJ?  I don't remember. 
[02:06:00]  You had a DJ only for your after party.  Yeah.  That was the shit.  The after party was the shit.  This wedding's going to be a letdown compared to that one.  Well, yeah, compared to Obie's wedding?  Well, mine was just a normal fucking run-of-the-mill Philly wedding.  What's wrong with you?  Obie's wedding was ridiculous.  It's not going to be like Obie's wedding.  It was a run-of-the-mill type of wedding.  There was nothing run-of-the-mill about it.  Ignore the chandeliers, and it was just a regular wedding.  Chas Palminteri showed up.  Oh, man.  We're not going to have any of that.  Is the place nice, though?  Yeah.  It's not like wood paneling, right?  No, it's nice.  Not a hall.  It's a barn. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  It's nice.  It's a barn?  Is it AC'd?  It should be.  I think it is.  Oh, fuck yeah.  It better be.  Holy shit.  I'm not going to sit there like a Baptist church.  No.  You know the green fly season starts this weekend?  Sunday.  Plenty up there.  You know that?  No.  I just said that.  That's pretty good.  Everybody would not worry about it.  I heard it starts today.  And the green flies know when their season starts.  Yeah, they wake up on Sunday.  Either today or tomorrow.  The green would envy.  Let's take a break.  Yeah, really.  That was powerful. 
[02:07:00]  Wow.  Well, I'm very excited to be gone, Sam.  Yeah?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think you are.  I'm psyched.  I'm confused by Anthony today.  He's not letting us in.  But I want to interview Ed about this.  He wouldn't be talking about it if he wasn't.  He's very aggressive.  You always think I have an ulterior motive when it's just me.  Yeah.  It's just me being me.  You're being a little more aggressive than usual.  I think I'm looking forward to this.  I think so.  Me too.  I actually am.  I think it'll be fun to all hang out.  Yeah.  You know?  We'll fucking get some lofts in.  Yeah.  They're going to be fun. 
[02:07:30]  He wouldn't be talking about it.  Are we allowed to tweet anything, Sam?  Yeah, you can tweet.  Oh, I'm going to tweet the shit out of it.  I'm going to tweet.  I'm allowed to tweet pictures.  You're going to be able to put all the pictures I take into Photoshop and make a movie out of it.  That's how many times I'm going to fucking tweet.  We're going to tweet pictures, though.  That's why I'm asking.  Is there a media blackout?  No, you could tweet pictures.  Upskirts?  Can I tweet some upskirts?  Updress.  You could tweet upskirts of anyone who works for this company.  No, I'm talking like fucking your family and shit.  No, that wouldn't be good.  Your moms, yo?  Yeah.  Yeah? 
[02:08:00]  And maybe, no, don't tweet pictures of Jess.  She probably wouldn't like that.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, she's a civilian.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  She has no desire to be playing this nonsense.  And my family is dumb.  They'll pose for pictures because they don't understand that once you're out there, it's  not good.  Forever.  And it's not fun.  The internet's forever.  Yeah.  And people just say nasty shit about you.  Of course they will.  They have no idea.  Unlike here, where we only say nice things.  Yeah, exactly.  It's been a long week.  That's why I had to come in today.  Because E-Rock didn't come in on his wedding day.  And we shit on his wedding for an hour. 
[02:08:30]  Oh, man.  That's right.  No, you weren't here.  Yes, you were here.  I was here, Sam.  You were here and you shit on his wedding.  That's right.  I was here.  Hold the tape.  I need to at least be here when it gets shat upon.  Shat upon.  You know?  I like D-Rock's wedding.  That's because...  Never mind.  Uh-oh.  What?  What?  Go ahead.  What did I do at his wedding?  No, you didn't do anything.  There's just been jokes about him taking some of the elements from your wedding.  Oh, my God. 
[02:09:00]  Did he?  It kind of did, yeah.  And kind of making it like a lower scale.  There was a few things that looked a little familiar.  Did you get some ideas for my wedding, E-Rock?  You like my car?  Yeah, I painted it orange like yours.  Oh, my God.  But fatter.  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  What did he do?  I didn't see many photo booths until my wedding.  Oh, but did he take you into the next room?  Did you look at the candy?  I wanted to show you the candy that I got.  It's like yours. 
[02:09:30]  Fair is fair.  We're going to have a photo booth.  Kiss you on the mouth.  I think I started the photo booth trend.  I've been to a lot of Philly weddings since, and they all use photo booths now.  Oh, really?  We'll have a photo booth.  I know I wasn't the first.  Oh, you got a photo booth?  In my world, I was.  Actually, you were.  I don't know.  Candy table?  No.  That'd be a direct rainbow.  White trash.  White candy table.  Did he rock to a candy table?  Well, the thing is, Obie's candy table.  Main table.  Obie's candy table could not be competed with.  Can I?  Yeah, it's crazy.  I don't like really talking numbers, but I'll tell you this much. 
[02:10:00]  The candy table probably costs as much as an average person's wedding.  Oh, boy.  Probably as much as my wedding.  Oh, my God.  I'm not even joking.  Oh, my God.  How big was that candy table?  It was huge.  It had everything you could imagine.  It was enough to stock a candy store.  Literally.  Jimmy was very excited.  He was filling up bags of candy.  Yeah.  Jimmy was so excited.  I'll tell you that much.  I think the candy table was a little over the top.  What else did Irock do that was kind of familiar?  He did the candy table.  But he did like, it was like familiar, but it wasn't quite there.  Right.  He had a photo booth, but it wasn't a photo booth. 
[02:10:30]  Oh, no.  Are you doing the photo booth photo album?  Yeah.  I mean, that's why it's the only way to do it.  You know?  And like, you know.  Oh, the jobs numbers came in and they're under what they said they were going to be.  No.  Yeah.  It was at 8.1.  Now it's 8.2.  Yeah.  Unemployment up to 8.2.  Yeah, I know.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  They thought it was going to be higher than that or lower?  They thought it was going to stay the same and there were going to be more jobs.  Well, it's sort of the same.  8.1, 8.2. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  Believe me, when it's up in the 8s, 0.1 or 2 makes a big difference.  True.  Yeah.  They're saying he's the first president with levels that high.  Yeah, this is crazy.  Going into a re-election, right?  Very, very vulnerable.  This is going to be a tricky one.  Yeah.  He could be a one-termer.  It's actually in the realm of possibility.  Well, but gas prices will be 50 cents a gallon.  Oh, it's going to be amazing.  Just watch the gas prices plummet by the end of the summer.  Yeah, October.  Oh, it's going to be great. 
[02:11:30]  You're going to love it.  He'll save everything.  Well, yeah, I guess I'm trying to think of what I was doing.  Why I couldn't make it to E-Rock's wedding.  Well, I remember Stan's wedding.  There was a chair for you.  Oh, boy.  What happened there?  I don't know.  You weren't there.  I was probably...  I think...  And the chair at my wedding might have been empty for half of it.  I was away.  I think you didn't...  No, I hung out for that one.  No, you left kind of early.  Did I?  Yeah, you did.  A little early.  Let me think. 
[02:12:00]  You went to AC.  You went to AC.  Oh, yeah.  With your entire table by the way.  Yes, I did.  You know what?  That's right.  That was a nice gesture.  Hey, we were close.  We appreciated that one.  It was nice.  Shut up.  It was nice.  Yeah.  All of a sudden, there's a whole empty table.  Where are they?  Oh, they're on their way to AC.  They're on their way to AC.  They're down in Philly.  It's close.  It was a nice touch, though.  It was different.  Everybody's spread out.  We got a little more room.  We came back, I think, right?  No.  No, I'm kidding.  I had a gig for E-Rock's wedding.  I was a hard one, but I was in Poughkeepsie, and that was a money gig. 
[02:12:30]  You're giving up money for Sam's wedding.  Yes, I am, but I am rebooked.  Right.  Oh.  A good amount of money for Sam.  But E-Rock's gig.  I think everyone knows Sam's more important than E-Rock, though, in our lives, to be honest  with each other.  I know how we're kind of dancing around the subject here, but Sam's a little more important  than E-Rock.  Yeah, a little bit.  I don't think it was coming up at all, but thanks for introducing it.  I didn't even bring that up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just couldn't give up the money. 
[02:13:00]  E-Rock, do you feel weird, though, that everyone's going to Sam's and half the people  didn't show at yours?  No, I got very nice gifts from the two that weren't able to attend.  I gave you a gift, right?  Yes.  Can I tell you something?  Jimmy's good for a good gift.  I hope so.  Oh, boy.  The gifts.  What about the cash?  What about the envelope?  Yeah.  We're hoping for an envelope.  I do checks.  Yes.  Checks and cash.  What about cash?  Cash is great.  Cash is king.  Yeah.  Don't worry about that pesky registry. 
[02:13:30]  Now, who do you think is going to come up with the biggest fucking amount?  I want all three of you to know there'll be a direct competition going on.  I want an asshole to find out.  No, there's a competition between the two of them.  We all know who's coming in third.  I am.  Oh, Jimmy.  I don't mind.  Yeah.  There is.  We're changing it from Opie and Anthony to Opie versus Anthony, Czech Wars.  Oh, Czech Wars.  Yes.  That's great.  Uh-huh.  New on A&E.  Well, it all depends on what time of the night you get Ant to write the check.  That's true.  If you get him to write at 8 o'clock, it could be close. 
[02:14:00]  If it's fucking 2.30 a.m., hands down, Ant wins.  I do tend to get a bit generous.  It's not good as money if you're not giving it away.  It's going to get a bit generous.  I think Eric's wife is a little annoyed that Roland is coming to mind.  Oh.  Because not only...  Because Eric had asked him to be a best man.  Wow.  And Roland said yes.  Then like a week out, he flaked out.  And then he also said he wasn't going to the wedding.  Holy shit.  Why did he do that?  Why did he treat it at your Oxford Terrible? 
[02:14:30]  And I think Eric's wife is a little annoyed at Roland.  And that's not based on anything she said.  It's based on the tone of her voice when she was talking to Roland on the phone about it.  Is that because she had a cradle E-Rock through his tears when he...  Were you upset?  When Roland said he wasn't going.  Were you upset?  Yeah, why did Roland go to your wedding?  I still don't have a direct answer.  Going from best man to not going to the wedding is pretty fucking huge.  It's fucked.  I had one of those.  You did?  Yeah.  Anyone we know?  No, a guy I grew up with.  We were like really good friends. 
[02:15:00]  And then he started smoking pot.  And he blamed his pot smoking on me.  Because his fucking wife called him out on it.  So I went from assuming I was going to be best man to being in the bridal party to not being invited at all.  At all.  Because his fucking wife-to-be thought I was the bad influence on this kid's life.  Wow.  Wedding, going to Anne's Point didn't last at all.  And I haven't talked to the kid since.  How pathetic are you, man, to do that? 
[02:15:30]  What happened with Roland?  He told me, well, the new Harry Potter was out.  So he needed to go see it.  Wow.  Why are you still friends with him?  I have no idea.  Yeah, what's the matter?  Why do you take abuse from people that's genuine?  Like, I mean, we all goof on each other.  But if somebody mistreated me like, like, and then why would you tolerate anybody doing that to you?  Yeah, I wouldn't talk to the person again.  I didn't talk to him for a while.  Oh.  For a while.  Ooh, that showed up.  That showed his boss.  You should only be friends with people who are nice to you.  I would never talk to Roland if he did that to me. 
[02:16:00]  Oh, Roland.  Wow.  You guys are good friends, man.  Where is Roland?  He should come in here and explain himself.  Yeah.  I wonder why.  Does he get awkward at events?  He gets drunk at events.  Like, hostilely drunk.  He does, though.  Like, he's not a guy to go to weddings.  Like, he no-showed my bachelor party.  Like, I don't think he feels comfortable in...  Yeah.  There's some stuff you don't want to go to.  You just do it.  He doesn't feel comfortable.  He fucking was in the strip club coming in his pants in fucking Cleveland. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah, but I think that's around, like, us.  Like, I don't think he feels comfortable going to, like, weddings and stuff like that.  Oh, yeah.  Is he going to eat this one?  He is going to mine.  Oh, so he says.  I hope he doesn't know, Sean.  Prometheus is out, so.  He might be going to see Snow White and the Huntsman.  Yeah.  Very busy seeing movies.  All right.  We should break.  Maybe we get Roland in here to explain himself.  Don't we have another guest coming in? 
[02:17:00]  Saba Saga, yeah.  I don't know who he is, Jimmy, to be honest with you.  He's Jonathan's friend.  I've eaten with him.  He's a...  I love this guy.  You do?  Yeah, yeah.  He's been on Jon Stewart and Colbert and Charlie Rose.  He's a media mogul in Afghanistan.  Wow.  Who, uh...  He's the guy that runs the Afghan television stations.  And he's the guy that pipes in American shows to Iran.  Oh, wow.  In Farsi.  Just to fucking expose American culture to the Iranians.  And the Iranians hate him. 
[02:17:30]  So the Iranians turn on TV and all of a sudden it's like, ah, womp, womp, womp, womp, womp, womp, womp, womp, womp, womp.  And the Ropers are talking and fucking...  There it is.  The officials hate him.  The people must love him.  The people do like him.  They're always trying to block his signals.  Yeah, because the people of Iran are ready for some change.  Yeah.  But they're able to keep him down still.  And he runs the...  There's a show called Afghan...  Not...  There's American Idol, Afghan Star, which is the American Idol.  And they get like 30 million viewers a week, I think. 
[02:18:00]  They got Afghans doing American Idol.  Yeah.  He's running American type culture television.  I would love to see a clip of that.  Like, what songs do they sing?  And he has a fucking show there called The Ministry, which is like The Office, which is...  It's about...  The Ministry.  It's a sarcastic...  I think it's about like the Ministry of Garbage, where it's like a reality...  A fake reality show based on the Ministry of Garbage, which doesn't exist, of course.  But I want to ask him Taliban questions, because...  Yeah, sure.  He's constantly... 
[02:18:30]  President Karzai is, I think, constantly irritated with him.  He's interesting.  Here comes Iraq's best towel.  What is it?  What happened?  Roland White.  Now, we heard you went from being the best man at Iraq's wedding, which is a pretty big fucking thing.  You had three best men, though.  Did you?  You can't have three best men.  They're groomsmen, then.  Yeah, I had a best man and groomsmen.  Roland was going to be one of the groomsmen.  Oh, see, that's...  Oh, my God.  Fucking butchered the story.  You just fucking lied.  I'm not going here already again.  You said he was supposed to be the best man. 
[02:19:00]  I never said that.  You said that before.  You said that.  Yeah, but you didn't...  You agreed to it.  But you didn't correct anybody.  Yeah, and you said it before.  If it was wrong.  When it was actually happening.  You said he was going to be...  He was supposed to be in the wedding party.  And you said...  Oh, man.  You said as recently as last week that he was one of the best men.  Liar.  You always said best man.  Because...  Fuck it.  I'm not telling you this again.  Liar, liar, fun, do on fire.  Don't listen.  You said he's a best man.  And then just now you said he's a groomsman.  Two because my wife couldn't pick for her maid of honor between her sister and her best friend. 
[02:19:30]  So she had both of them.  So I was going to have two on my side.  And he was going to be one of them.  Just a minute ago you said he was one of three groomsmen.  And now you're saying he's one of two best men.  Because it's...  I keep trying to explain this to you.  Was he one of three or one of two?  You're not explaining it, stupid yellow-faced shirt.  Was he one of three or one of two?  Who cares?  He didn't show up.  That's true.  Why didn't you go, Roland?  Wow.  The real reason?  I flew out to his bee with my dad.  He had knee surgeries.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  Iraq, why are you angry at that, man? 
[02:20:00]  That's a very good reason.  His dad had knee surgery.  Iraq, do you believe that?  I just sound the air out with that Harry Potter.  Iraq?  Oh.  Iraq doesn't believe him.  Iraq?  That's...  Iraq?  It's hard to argue with.  Iraq wants medical records.  Why is it hard to argue with?  Because I know about some of the stuff with his dad for the past couple of years, and  I can't argue with that if that was the case.  Yeah, but you don't believe him. 
[02:20:30]  Why don't you believe him?  I didn't believe him about the Harry Potter at all.  I know.  I just gave that as an excuse because my dad didn't want anybody to know.  That's all.  So you...  That's the worst...  That's the worst cup of rum ever.  I love that Roland doesn't mind making himself look like an asshole.  Yeah, I don't care.  He's a loyal guy.  I love that Roland had a real issue, but then goes, ah.  I'll just tell him I'm going to see Harry Potter.  Yeah.  That's right, though.  I'll just fucking...  Anyone else would have something a little better than that.  Yeah, so people would just laugh.  I didn't go, what a dickhead.  And then they'd move on and leave me alone.  Oh, my God. 
[02:21:00]  You didn't go at all.  And I did go to Sam's bachelor party because I started my diet, and I know week one I'll  go booze crazy.  So I was doing booze.  Good real reason.  I thought you were uncomfortable at events like that.  No.  Oh.  I just...  I go...  This is week one.  If I know Greg Charles, I love him to death, I'll go boozing with him.  So I was on my diet.  He is a red-faced drunk, isn't he?  Oh, he is.  So you'll be okay with this, though.  You're on the mend for a while now?  Well, yeah.  Now I've been on, so I can have fun.  We're going to have fun in the table?  We'll have carrots together, Rowland. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, some carrot sticks.  I love a good small fucking baby carrot.  Do you really?  Yeah, who doesn't?  Ugh.  Little dog dick.  That's why I love it.  In one sentence, Rowland went from being a scumbag to being, like, an awesome guy.  Yeah.  Like, you're a good guy.  Wow.  No, but I just...  My dad goes, ah, just say something.  I'm like, all right.  The only thing I can think of.  Harry Potter.  You rock?  You all right with that now?  I'm going to have to be.  Oh, boy.  What do you mean you're going to have to be? 
[02:22:00]  You should be.  You should be.  It's family.  You bag of shite.  You're not happy.  But there is a Prometheus screening, so...  Next, it's on Tuesday.  I'm going to go to that one.  I'm going to try to get some pussy at this wedding.  Yeah?  Fuck yeah.  Some snitch?  I'm on pussy hunt mode.  I'm trying to get some pussy.  I'm going to be fucking...  I'm going to pop a Cialis' slow dance with every hole in that room.  That'll be fun to watch. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, man.  Oh, you old pup tenting.  Fuck yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, look at that.  Should we take a break?  Because our guest is here.  He's here.  Let's take a break-a-rooney.  All right, quick break, and we'll have Saad...  Moussini.  Moussini.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Next.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And we're back. 
[02:23:00]  Got a special guest in the studio.  Saad Veson.  That's right, Saad.  Am I saying it right?  Moussini.  Moussini, yep.  Good enough.  And Jonathan, of course, too, who brought Saad in.  Hello.  Yeah, Jonathan introduces weird groupings of people.  That's what I say to Jonathan.  With that?  Who is this Jim Norton guy?  Yeah, but it's like, we're two people that probably never should have met and become  friends in a fair world.  But Jonathan just has this really weird interweaving with any group.  Oh, I've seen him socialize with just the most eclectic group of people. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah.  The drunk chick and her boyfriend at the hotel were great.  He was sharing pizza with them.  That's right.  Amazing.  Yeah, at 5 o'clock in the morning.  Yeah.  How do you guys know each other?  Through Tom Preston.  Our friend Tom.  Our old boss.  Yeah.  Yeah, he used to work for CBS.  He wasn't really our boss.  He was in the TV division, I think, at the time.  Well, no, he was president of ICOM.  Oh, was he?  Yeah.  Well, that's a big wig.  And then Tom, who used to live in Afghanistan, he met Saad. 
[02:24:00]  How did you guys meet Saad?  Well, my wife actually met him because she's in the rag trade.  And she said, you have to meet this guy who in the 70s was producing clothing in Afghanistan.  And now he's in the television business.  I rang him up one day and we decided to catch up.  And that's how it started.  I would never do that.  I would never just call somebody I hadn't met. 
[02:24:30]  Like, Jonathan will do that too.  He'll go away and go, I had dinner with him.  I'm like, with who?  And he's like, oh, well, you know, Saad has a friend who, I'm like, you met this guy and  ate with him?  What's the matter with you?  The funny thing was that, so I said, what does, you know, I didn't even Google him.  I asked him, I said, what's he look like?  And she said, oh, he's rugged, he's like a Marlboro man.  And she described me to him as an Afghan.  So we sat opposite each other at the Four Seasons Hotel for 40 minutes, failing to recognize  you.  So we finally came up.  He goes, hey, man, are you Saad?  I said, yes, I am.  And that's how we...  Well, you don't look like an Afghan. 
[02:25:00]  He does not look like the Marlboro man.  That's a terrible description of Tom Freston.  He looks more of an Afghan than I do.  Yeah, yeah.  He's kind of a creepy looking guy.  And I was trying to describe what exactly it is you do in Afghanistan.  Because here, we don't know a lot about...  I mean, I do.  But a lot of the audience doesn't know a lot about Afghan culture.  Well, I mean, we have television and radio stations.  You know, we have programs like your program in the morning, probably a little bit less  risque.  But so we have radio, television, we have a production company. 
[02:25:30]  And, you know, we reach, you know, 60, 70 percent of the population on a daily basis.  What is the radio like there?  That would be interesting, too, because you own a radio station there.  Yes.  Or more than one.  We own two networks.  They're both national networks.  Now, what is the radio, morning radio there like?  You know, it's, you know, formats are very similar.  I mean, people just, a lot of, it's fast, you know, it's funny.  They drag all sorts of people in in the morning.  They ring government officials. 
[02:26:00]  They make fun of them.  Literally drag them in.  Literally drag them in.  And, you know, and people have complaints.  They call people directly and say, you know, how do you respond to this?  But it's a lot of fun, music.  It's lively.  It's actually the sort of format that works elsewhere.  Because we have this, I have this conception of Afghanistan as this frightening wasteland where any type of an infraction is going to have the, literally, that's the way I see Afghanistan.  I've seen these horrible videos. 
[02:26:30]  When I went, Jim said to me, they're going to cut your head off.  I really did.  I was telling them to watch beheading videos because I said, dude, you're fucking crazy.  It scares me to go there.  But then you hear, like, no, they got morning radio.  And what is the Taliban influence?  Like, do we get it?  Is it blown out of proportion of what we hear here?  Yeah.  I mean, they have influence in some parts of the country and they terrorize.  So they don't actually, you know, control things.  They just basically plant bombs from time to time or use suicide bombers.  But you don't actually see them on a daily basis. 
[02:27:00]  New York is a lot more dangerous.  Really?  Than Afghanistan?  Than Kabul.  There's parts of Afghanistan you wouldn't be safe in.  But overall, I mean, it's always, media always exaggerates these sorts of things.  What's your relationship with the Taliban?  Well, they commit all sorts of acts and they call us up and they take credit and we air it.  And, I mean, there was one time I got a call.  I was at a function and there was a very polite person and he said, hello.  And he asked me how I was and I asked about the family. 
[02:27:30]  I asked, I mean, a polite conversation going on for a few minutes.  Then he finally said, listen, you know, we feel hurt.  I said, why?  He said, you know, every day we kill so many Americans and so many heathens.  And, you know, you don't give us credit.  You know, we put so much effort into this, we don't get enough credit.  I mean, it was serious.  It went on for 20 minutes, you know.  And I said, well, we'll try, you know, but, you know, you do tend to exaggerate things.  He said, we never exaggerate.  Just today we killed 50 Americans.  But, you know, of course, they have these sorts of declarations on a daily basis. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  So as a media company, you obviously have to, you know, they talk to you, they ring you up.  But, you know, we don't have any other relationship besides that.  But, I mean, they do, like, is it like a love-hate thing, like where they would, because, again, we look at them like they're these, these, you can't communicate with them.  And I forget, like, they're like any other group, good, bad, or indifferent.  They have ways they conduct business and ways they do public relations.  They're very professional.  They're a lot better than the U.S. and Afghan forces because their media operations is savvy. 
[02:28:30]  They tweet.  And then at times, and then at times, I'll give you the address.  You have to follow them.  And then usually you have, you know, a shit fight between the NATO guys tweeting and the Taliban.  So they say, we killed 20 people.  And then ISAF says, which is the Americans, well, you know, they're not being very truthful.  And then they say, yes, we are.  And they say, you know, I mean, this goes on, like, for 15, 20 minutes.  Are you afraid?  Well, you know, of course, we all have fear from time to time. 
[02:29:00]  It's completely natural, yes.  But it doesn't paralyze us, but we're very mindful of how, what a threat, you know, some people are to us.  Are you like a marked man?  The people want to get rid of you?  Really?  Well, I suppose so.  But there are probably a lot of marked men in Afghanistan on both sides.  But also Iran.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You've got some shenanigans going on there in Iran, huh?  We've got a couple of satellite channels going into Iran. 
[02:29:30]  And what gets broadcast to Iran?  Dubbed telenovelas.  Dubbed telenovelas.  So, it's that heavy drama stuff.  The heavy drama stuff.  And, you know, it's, you know, the regime thinks that we're giving people ideas to do bad things.  And they don't like us.  Probably pornography is what they say.  What kind of shows, though?  What shows in particular?  You know, we buy a lot of stuff from, you know, Telemundo and Caracol and all the Telemundo shows. 
[02:30:00]  With those big-breasted.  Lots of cleavage.  Oh, yeah.  I just love that.  Would you show my special in Farsi?  Do you know how happy that would make me?  How much that would not be popular in Iran?  That would be cool, yeah.  Your happiness is really important to us, but probably not that important.  I would like that a lot.  Can we get it dubbed in Farsi?  I just saw the opening.  It's great.  Fantastic. 
[02:30:30]  Oh, the new one.  Oh, I meant the old one.  Oh, the new one.  Yeah, that probably would play very well.  That wouldn't play very well.  Oh, no.  Not at all.  It'll give people ideas, though.  So, when you...  Do you go to Iran?  No, I can't.  Oh, man.  Would you be arrested?  First and foremost, they wouldn't give me a visa.  But if they did, I'd just have to be careful.  Maybe I'm too high-profile for them to arrest me, but they would never give me a visa.  And what about...  You know, I've argued this point many times, because we talked about the raid in Pakistan, 
[02:31:00]  which got bin Laden, and people who like Obama.  Like, I kind of like Obama.  I thought, yeah, it was a ballsy move to make to go in there to another country who's an ally.  And people who are like, no, any president would have made that call.  And I may be wrong, but was that a ballsy thing for him to do?  It is, but there has to be follow-up.  I mean, the thing about Pakistan is...  I mean, I don't understand.  I mean, there are a lot of threats in the world, but Pakistan is literally...  It's a state that trains terrorists, funds terrorists, gives them sanctuary. 
[02:31:30]  And I think we're all in denial that this is...  Yeah, it's a good vacation place.  And the Americans are still giving the Pakistanis billions of dollars of aid on an annual basis.  I mean, at some stage, someone's got to say, enough's enough.  And I think a lot of people feel, well, we can't do without them.  It's, you know, the option of just shutting them off completely, you know, closing basically the relationship completely or shutting it down is...  It's not something we should contemplate.  But, you know, we have to... 
[02:32:00]  I mean, they contribute to U.S. deaths on a daily basis in Afghanistan.  Yeah, why are we paying them?  And you're paying them.  That's crazy.  Do they hate us, the people there?  Well, I think, you know, they've been provoked.  I mean, it's very difficult to tell.  The Americans, obviously, you know, from a PR perspective, you know, they sort of run...  It's difficult to win this PR war, given that there's a conflict going on next door.  But, yes, I think the people have been provoked.  And the country is very miserable. 
[02:32:30]  It's very poor.  One percent of the population pays taxes.  People are unwilling to...  It's like here.  Yeah, at least you have some rich people, the one percent.  But I think the guy who...  The biggest taxpayer in Pakistan makes $100,000.  It's something...  As an individual.  The largest individual tax.  Righteous bucks.  And he's like the local CEO of IBM, so he has to pay his taxes because IBM probably insists on it.  So I think in places like Pakistan, people have to be forced to take ownership of their own issues 
[02:33:00]  and not blame others for their problems.  So it's a country that's heavily subsidized by the international community, the IMF, the World Bank, the U.S., and everyone.  And yet they offer sanctuary to thousands of terrorists on a daily basis.  What's the endgame with Afghanistan?  It's like Obama said he was going to end the war and then he was going to close Guantanamo.  And we haven't done either.  Well, I'm not sure about Guantanamo.  I think that they have severe problems in terms of dealing with these, you know, enemy combatants.  But the war in Afghanistan is coming to an end. 
[02:33:30]  I think the Americans will probably have some sort of a permanent or semi-permanent presence in the country for at least 10 years.  But then...  You said once, I saw you speak and you said that if the Americans pulled out today, the government would collapse within 24 to 48 hours.  Wow.  Well, that was probably...  I mean, every day, things improve, you know, because the army gets better, the police gets better.  It's probably less and it would be less drastic today than it was six months ago.  And in a year's time, it's going to be a lot better and the Afghans could probably take over. 
[02:34:00]  But, you know, it's costing you 100 billion plus dollars a year.  I mean, that money doesn't go to the Afghans.  It goes to, you know, food, clothing, heating, and it goes to all the big contractors.  I mean, there was one story a friend of mine was telling me that he sells $60 million worth of mineral water to the military.  And I said, well, $60 million, that's quite a bit of money.  He said, yeah, but they...  Some soldiers are so paranoid that they use the mineral water for the showers. 
[02:34:30]  Why?  Because they think that the well water is not, you know, clean.  And so they have these Afghan guys who basically, you know, use one liter bottle just to fill up these big tanks so they can have showers.  So what are the odds of getting our show broadcast in Afghanistan?  Can we get a lot of soldiers that actually listen to us?  A lot of U.S. soldiers will listen to us online.  Online, yeah.  I'm great with that.  And say like, yeah, would we be popular with the...  We'd behave.  We'll behave. 
[02:35:00]  Well, I'm sure that you can request to go.  They will fly you up there and protect you, and you'll be in the base.  No, no, I mean with the local Afghans.  Would this show be well received?  Well, maybe.  It's possible.  Anything's possible.  Would I be safe if I went there on a vacation?  Yes, absolutely.  Really?  Yeah.  None of us believe that.  Bold.  No, I'm just saying, as Americans, none of us believe that.  He's crazy.  Why would we be safe?  Like, change your minds on that. 
[02:35:30]  Well, firstly, you know, people are not anti-American per se.  Walking down the street, no one's going to say anything to you.  Jonathan, is that true?  That's true, yeah.  And, you know, it's not like Iraq, where I think it was palpable how much they despised the Americans.  And Afghanistan, the internationals still remain popular after 10 years of fighting, which is extraordinary.  So, you know, you'd be completely safe.  How about Iran?  Do they hate us?  Because I've heard that the people in Iran like us, and they like the fact it's their own government that they hate. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah.  I think the Iranians, you'd be surprised how welcoming they would be.  But they would never let you in.  Why?  They've probably seen your show.  No, I'll eat it.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, there's a few Muslim jokes.  Would I be arrested for those jokes there or no?  Well, if you made them in public, probably, potentially, yes.  How about Dubai?  Because people tell me to go do gigs in Dubai, and I'm like, nah.  You know, Russell Peters was there.  And then...  Yeah, but he had a problem there.  Did he have something?  Russell wanted to do certain... 
[02:36:30]  Because he sells it everywhere.  His first concert was okay, but then afterwards he got a call, or they came and visited him, the police.  Oh, jeez.  And they said, you know, but Dubai is quite good in the sense that, you know, everything's relative for, you know, there's no other country like Dubai, so they have a high degree of tolerance.  I think that he still did a few jokes, but, you know, he just had to be careful about certain acts and so forth on stage.  What is, like, if you do stuff, anything sexual or anything that is... 
[02:37:00]  Because you broadcast stuff that, I guess, deemed offensive to Islam, right?  Well, to some people's interpretation of Islam.  Right.  Uh-huh, yeah.  It's been interpreted differently.  Different lies the problem.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, the Taliban had a rule about, you know, beard length, you know, I mean, things like that, which are ridiculous.  So, yeah, but, you know, like, the silent majority, they just want to do normal things.  They want to watch music videos.  They want to watch soap operas. 
[02:37:30]  They want to have fun.  It's usually the crazies.  Weren't you showing stuff that the Taliban had never seen, like, men and women talking on TV?  Like, wasn't that something that they didn't show on the television?  Well, they didn't have a TV.  They banned television.  Oh, did they?  Yeah.  But, yeah, I mean, we had men and women together, and they're, you know, conversing in a normal way.  We've come a long way in 10 years.  You've got to remember, also, that the country is 60% of the population is under the age of 20.  It's a very young country.  So, the demographics are changing very quickly. 
[02:38:00]  I mean, all of the Middle East is like that.  The bulk of the population is under 30 in almost every country from North Africa all the way to Indonesia.  Is that why they're so radical?  Like, the ones that are radical are easy to make radical because they're young and impressionable?  They don't have jobs, you know.  They're poor.  And they're frustrated.  And the government's corrupt.  And sometimes, you know, you look at Egypt.  You know, why is the Brotherhood gaining in popularity?  It's because they're one of the few groups that do provide services, and they seem to be more honest than the others.  Same with Turkey.  Isn't it weird? 
[02:38:30]  Like, we help kind of, we support Egypt overthrowing their government, and it's going to be a more radical government that's probably anti-U.S. than Mubarak was, right?  Yeah, but you've got to look at it longer term.  You know, the country may go to the right in terms of fundamentalism, but it'll come back to the center.  Maybe, you know, what's 10 years or what's five years?  Mubarak, it was inevitable that Mubarak was going to fall.  If you had been seen as protecting Mubarak at the end, it would have played very badly for decades. 
[02:39:00]  Do you think it was nice that they stripped Gaddafi naked?  Did they do that just to kind of humiliate him, you think, strip him naked?  They just maybe wanted to check him out.  Yeah, right?  Let's see what he's packing.  I would probably be curious, because he did always have women around him.  I would probably be curious too as to what he had.  Yeah, and a lot of pornography, I guess.  He had their videos, and who was he really in love with?  Condoleezza Rice.  Yeah, Condoleezza Rice.  He had a mad crush on her.  Did he really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He'd written poems about her and everything, yeah.  Yeah, really?  You didn't know that?  No!  Oh, yeah.  By the look on Jim's face, I don't think you're pleased to hear that. 
[02:39:30]  I was in a short movie with Devin Rattray that was about him being into Condoleezza Rice, and he had this big crush on her.  And I did a couple of weird improv scenes, and they keep wanting me to promote it, but it's like, no, I just did it like, you know.  It was you and the guy from Entourage.  Yeah, Adrian Grenier or something.  Grenier.  Grenier was in it too, but I don't know if he's promoting it.  They keep asking me to go to the premiere.  I'm like, no. 
[02:40:00]  What do the Afghan people think the end game is as far as the Americans being there?  Like, what do they think our mission is there?  Well, I mean, obviously, there are a lot of conspiracy theorists.  A lot of Afghans believe that Afghanistan is situated very strategically between Iran and Pakistan, and both of those countries potentially could threaten the world and U.S. interests.  So a lot of people believe that, you know, the Americans need to have a presence for that reason, and terrorism, of course. 
[02:40:30]  Some people believe because of the large, vast mineral resources that we have that have been completely unexploited.  They're a combination of things.  But, you know, the international, even to this day, something like 60% of the population supports the presence of international troops on an ongoing basis.  Well, between America and the Russians, it's been that way for so many years.  Maybe they just don't know the difference at this point.  Well, the Americans, I mean, the Russians killed a million Afghans. 
[02:41:00]  There's a difference.  And they went into people's homes, and basically villages are completely destroyed.  You know, toys is, you know, bombs shaped as toys and mines and all sorts of things.  A million people handicapped, a million people killed.  So there must have been an apprehension to let the Americans in in the first place.  It just might have seemed like, oh, boy, here we go again.  No, I think that because of the Taliban, I mean, they'd been in power for five or six years.  I mean, it was just, people were so badly treated. 
[02:41:30]  They would have welcomed anyone to rescue them from their clutches.  How do you get a nation that just has been war-torn for so many years?  Like, what is it about Afghanistan that just says war all the time?  Well, you know, you've got to, I mean, I think a lot of Americans don't realize this.  Afghanistan was a country at peace.  The last conflict we had had was in 1919 when we fought the Brits, our third war against the British.  And in 1979, late 1979, the Russians invaded Afghanistan. 
[02:42:00]  And then the world, and particularly the Americans in the Southeast, pumped billions of dollars into, you know, into the region, provoking and encouraging the Afghans to fight the Russians.  So in effect, we fought the proxy war on behalf of the world.  So the sacrifices the Afghan nation made in that 10th decade, because the Russians pulled out in 1989, it was enormous.  And, you know, of course, I mean, I think a lot of people forget what a big sacrifice it was, because to a large extent, I'm not saying that that was the reason why the Russian Empire, the Soviet Empire collapsed. 
[02:42:30]  I think it was a big part of...  But it may have been a couple of big straws at the very end that broke the camel's back.  So it had a huge impact.  Then the world completely forgot about Afghanistan.  It was basically outsourced to the Pakistanis.  And the Afghans have suffered greatly.  But the fighting, you have to remember, started because we were, to a large extent, used by the internationals to fight this proxy war against the Soviets. 
[02:43:00]  So we kind of fought Russia through Afghanistan in a way, the way they fought the Americans through Vietnam.  Like that.  Just by giving...  Like we fought the Chinese at Korea.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's always...  There's always some poor country that's got to deal with the big boys fighting in their yards.  It was very costly for the Russians, for the Soviets.  And, you know, so the Afghans did play an important role in terms of the Soviet Empire collapsing.  And since then, it's been bad news.  But, you know, again, the people, you know, and Jonathan's been there. 
[02:43:30]  It's not like they're war crazy.  And people are tired.  I mean, they just want to do normal things.  I would gather.  And so how does that get solved with the Americans finally leaving at some point?  What did Obama say?  2013?  Something like that?  It's by 2014.  But it may happen sooner than that, actually.  Yeah.  And where do you see the country going, though?  Do you see a resurgence in the Taliban?  Do you see going back to business as usual?  Well, you know, I don't think so. 
[02:44:00]  The Taliban, you know, this is where a lot of people make this mistake.  They believe that the Taliban are like the VATCOM with a huge supporter base.  The Taliban's approval rating nationally is 10%.  Yeah.  Their approval rating.  I like the fact that there's an approval rating.  Yeah.  In the Nielsen's, they don't reach it.  But they don't look at the polls, obviously.  But, you know, they're despised.  I mean, who would want to be told how long their beard should be?  Yeah.  Or they're women beaten up on the street.  Or they're women kept at home.  Or not being able to have a television set. 
[02:44:30]  The TV and the beard were with you on the beating up the women.  I mean, we've never experienced that.  I wouldn't mind a month of that.  Then we can kind of go back to the way things are.  Just give us one month.  Just to straighten our broads out.  Yeah, just to show them how bad it could be.  Put them on the street.  What does Afghanistan have to contribute to the world as a nation that isn't at war?  Well, I mean, it has a very rich history.  And, you know, it has, I mean, to a large extent.  I mean, if Afghanistan's stable, there's a good chance that the world will be stable, 
[02:45:00]  given that the poorest region between Afghanistan and Pakistan has produced so many well-known terrorists over the decades.  Pump them out.  Look at the top 20.  All of them have come from that region.  So I think the question is, you know, that if a politician was to say we will disengage  and, God forbid, something were to happen in six months, who's going to take that responsibility?  And I think that, you know, people have to be very mindful of that.  The cost will be enormous if something bad were to happen. 
[02:45:30]  So I think there's a responsibility to continue keeping engaged.  But Afghanistan and Pakistan, I mean, Afghanistan's population is going to grow to 100 million from 30 million by 2050.  And Pakistan's population is going to grow to 400 million.  So you're going to have half a billion people by 2050.  And these things need to be taken into consideration.  And I think that's why this continued engagement is so important.  How many people are in the Taliban? 
[02:46:00]  20,000.  That's the whole fucking Taliban?  That's it.  And a 28 million people in the country.  Is it 28 million?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow, I thought there was a lot more than that.  They're just like a rambunctious 20,000.  That's a loud, that's the squeaky wheel.  But Jim, I mean, this is the thing with terrorism.  When you terrorize, you don't need to have a lot of people.  You know, they're not winning a conventional war.  They're terrorizing.  Where's Mullah Omar?  In Pakistan.  Oh, he is?  The one would assume, yes.  Oh, nobody knows.  He's hiding.  He's probably living in a house not dissimilar to the one that bin Laden lived in. 
[02:46:30]  Bin Laden, yeah.  Do you think the government knew bin Laden was there?  Absolutely.  Because they said we found no proof that they had.  No, no, but I mean, we have found no concrete proof that the government knew.  Listen, everyone knows it.  I mean, they will tell you this off the record.  But, you know, people think, well, shit, you know, we can't say this out loud.  It's going to ruin our relationship with the Pakistanis.  I mean, the doctor who helps the Americans get justice.  He's arrested, right?  He locked his ass up.  He locked up for 30 years or something.  I mean, they've thrown away the key, yes.  30 years for what?  He was getting blood samples to see if there was any bin Laden DNA, right? 
[02:47:00]  Do you know why he's been charged with and found guilty of?  What?  Helping militants, ironically.  Militants.  Terrorists, yes.  Yeah.  Meaning us?  No, bin Laden.  So he's been, I mean, the whole accusation, the court case was just a sham.  Yeah, yeah.  So they knew he was there, and why didn't any of it?  Jim, imagine West Point, all right?  And imagine within 500 meters of West Point, the biggest terrorist on the planet lives in  a mansion which stands out. 
[02:47:30]  You've seen nothing like it in the entire, like, region.  It's the three-story thing with high walls and ten times the size of the average house  there, 500 meters from the military college.  Wow.  And supplies had to be going in and out of there, and people.  So people, it's not like you can hide in a place like that for that long without people  from the outside kind of at least suspecting something's going on.  But, you know, I mean, Pakistan is in constant, you know, state of war, basically. 
[02:48:00]  So a military town, I mean, they would vet every individual who lived there because they're  so vulnerable, right?  It's not, I mean, West Point is probably not a good example because America is a very relaxed  place once you're inside.  So, you know, they're not going to vet people living around West Point, but in Pakistan they  would.  They would vet every individual who comes into that town because they would feel so vulnerable  they'd be scared of the Indians coming in.  So, like, if Jim went there to set up a house just for a vacation home, he would get vetted?  They would check him out, right?  Unfortunately, they destroyed Bin Laden's house, otherwise they would have probably offered 
[02:48:30]  that to you for a while.  Yeah, they'd probably put me and my quote-unquote lady friend behind those giant walls.  We don't want her running around.  But I heard that, like, there was, like, the guy who was his bodyguard was, Bin Laden's  bodyguard, the wife who lived with him, only saw Bin Laden once in five years because there  was a wall between the guardhouse and where Bin Laden was actually living.  It's like this place in Stern.  Yeah, exactly.  Pretty much the same height, at least.  I mean, if you're a senior military guy, you're going to your work, you know, and you see this 
[02:49:00]  monstrosity of this three-story house on your way to work, wouldn't you ask, hey, listen,  who lives in that house?  What is that?  It's a big house, right?  Let's find out, you know, who lives in that person.  Maybe we should have him over for dinner.  So I think people knew.  And wouldn't people say, like, I bet it's Bin Laden.  Like, it just would have to kind of go, eh, could be.  You know, I got a feeling about that place.  Yeah, yeah.  Do you think that he chose that place because of the military presence there?  Yes, because it would have been difficult for outsiders to come in and, you know, basically, 
[02:49:30]  you know, people were on the lookout.  I mean, there was a $25 million bounty on his head.  That just seems very coincidental.  So we don't want people sniffing around.  Let's have him in a place.  It's going to be difficult for others because anyone coming in to investigate the guy, they  would have found none that would have kicked him out, which is probably exactly what they  did.  And that's probably why the U.S. was never told Pakistan.  Well, do you blame them?  No.  I think it was a great, I think it was a ballsy move to go into a quote-unquote ally like 
[02:50:00]  that to fly in under their radar and embarrass their military.  I had dinner with General McRaven, the head of the Navy SEALs, who obviously was responsible  for that.  And, I mean, the training, they recreated the house somewhere else and they trained and  trained.  I mean, those guys are very good, the Navy SEALs, obviously.  Yeah.  But he was, you know, full of praise for Obama.  He said he was always the smartest guy in the room.  He knew exactly what he was doing.  And even when it was like 40, 60, success, he said, let's do it. 
[02:50:30]  And one mistake they made was, didn't they, this was apparently brought the helicopter  down, was they made it a chain link fence when they were doing the training, but the  actual wall was concrete.  So there was something about the wind with the helicopter whipping around, which smashed  the helicopter, which they didn't plan for.  Yeah.  I mean, these things can go wrong.  I mean, you look back to Iran.  But they planned for what would happen if a helicopter crashed.  I mean, that defined Jimmy Carter's presidency.  It certainly did, yeah.  And it was a risky move by Obama, but I think he had no choice, really. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah.  And he didn't want to drop bunker busters or whatever because they think that the Pakistanis  would never help us go through and, I mean, I would have bombed the place.  Yeah.  We would have lost all the information, though, that was going to help.  True.  True.  All that porno.  And giving an American soldier the opportunity to just blast that fucker in the face.  You know, come on.  Bomb.  It's a little less personal.  Yeah, they could have probably taken him alive if they wanted to, right?  But what for? 
[02:51:30]  I mean, it becomes a circus, you know.  A circus, a martyr.  The Norwegian guy.  It's a liability to have him alive.  You give him a platform, then.  Then he can say all sorts of things and, you know, provoke thousands of other young kids.  They probably did the right thing.  No, no, I mean, they could have taken him alive and let nobody know they'd taken him  alive if they wanted to.  Well, some people believe that that's the case.  Oh, well.  Where is he?  Jim's got to look into that.  Yeah, no, I don't know.  I kind of believe they just got rid of him quick, dumped him. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  You know, it was smart to put him in the ocean, right?  Because then there's no rallying point for people to go to.  Yeah, he doesn't become his shrine.  He just disappears.  Yeah, that's it.  There's some guy looking for his grave now in the ocean.  There's some guy who thinks he found bin Laden's...  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's like one of those explorer guys that, like, hunts for treasure.  And I think he thinks he knows where the body is.  James Cameron.  He's down there looking for his little sub.  There's a Nat Geo special coming up.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, did you hear about the mermaids?  That was pretty realistic.  Oh, stop it, Jimmy.  The animal planet really stinks.  For the love of God. 
[02:52:30]  So, uh...  It's interesting stuff, man.  But wait, when you went there, when you first went back, because you hadn't been there in  how many years?  Probably 20 years.  Was it crazy?  Was it still...  I mean, the U.S. was there at that point.  No, I think people were...  They were like zombies after, you know, living under the Taliban for such a long time.  They were just wandering aimlessly and, you know, the blank, you know, looks on their faces.  Because it's pretty amazing because he went there with his brother and they set up a TV station. 
[02:53:00]  They set up a radio station initially.  Oh, okay.  They didn't even know how to DJ, so I had to usually sit behind the mics and, you know...  I mean, like, Sod and his brother were reading manuals to set up satellites and stuff.  Jesus.  Literally.  That's pretty amazing.  Yeah, especially in a hostile place like that.  Yeah, yeah.  We can't get, like, good promotion here.  And we've stepped into, like, a fucking satellite company.  Yeah.  And to just go there and, like, with a hammer and nails and build a radio station is pretty impressive.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:53:30]  So what's happening in the news today?  I don't know, actually.  We've been talking about it.  He's getting married.  That's kind of our twink friend.  And we're all going to his wedding.  What did you call him?  Your first time?  Twink.  Twink?  Oh, God.  First marriage or second?  Or third?  Oh, man.  Oh, you're getting married, huh?  Yeah.  The first one, okay.  Yeah, congratulations.  For a little feller.  He's married and he was married.  I used to be, but fuck that.  I had it.  It didn't go well.  Oh, my God.  How many wives can you have in Afghanistan? 
[02:54:00]  As many as you wish.  As many as you wish?  I think it's technically four.  Yeah?  Who would want that?  I know.  That sounds great.  Like, yeah, you can have sex with all of them, but it's like, yeah, just marry one and  cheat.  There's no reason to have four people that you have to answer to.  Yeah.  It just seems sucky and enraging and expensive.  Yeah, of course.  Well, there's no divorce stuff.  You know, you don't get a piece of somebody.  You know, if you get divorced in Afghanistan, they can't sue you for alimony.  Or can they?  Yeah.  No, you have obligations.  You have to look after them and look after the kids. 
[02:54:30]  It's an expensive exercise.  All right.  What is it inherent about that area that just seems to promote the instability?  Like, there just seems to be so much infighting in the countries within, you know, tribal regions  and whatnot.  Like, what?  How did, not how did it start?  That's kind of silly.  But just what keeps it going?  Lack of education.  People are being sophisticated and they're, you know, basically not city dwellers. 
[02:55:00]  But all of that's changing.  I mean, it's becoming urbanized and people are becoming more sophisticated.  I mean, who would have thought that Egypt would have this sort of a sort of orange revolution  of sorts, a peaceful way of changing government?  Semi-peaceful.  I'm sure there are a few people that would beg to differ.  Guys that were run over by trucks down the street.  But they persisted, you know, the protests I'm talking about.  Yeah, yeah.  Doing it through peaceful means.  So Egypt has changed in 20 years. 
[02:55:30]  It's changed dramatically.  And people know what their rights are.  And young kids are using Facebook and they're tweeting and they're using the internet.  And, you know, that's a good sign.  And I think most of these countries will change for the better.  Yeah, communication does seem to be that thing that kind of brings people forward.  Television and mobiles.  Yeah, yeah.  It's changed the world more than you'd care to believe.  I think that was another straw with the Soviet Union, the fact that they couldn't 100% keep  the news state run.  Yeah. 
[02:56:00]  I mean, they were starting to get satellite and cable television from various other  regions.  And their lies weren't holding up anymore.  Yeah.  I mean, it was always the domain of the state, which is no longer the case.  And this is the problem we have in Iran is that, you know, 20, 30 million people watch  our television station in Iran and they don't want to lose that monopoly.  They want to monopolize people's eyes and ears.  Yeah.  Because that's how they can influence them.  Not that the people are never that stupid.  I mean, the only country which surprises me, people still believe the government line is 
[02:56:30]  in North Korea.  Right.  So when they go to South Korea and they think the whole thing is an act for them.  So some plumber from North Korea makes it to South Korea and then he believes that the  whole thing has been staged for him.  It takes a lot.  Ah, you guys.  It's not this good.  That's unbelievable.  Yeah.  What do you mean staged for him?  Yeah.  These skyscrapers, you know, beautiful women.  It's all fake.  It's all fake.  The bars, the cars.  It's not real.  Propaganda to show the North Koreans that, you know, look how great it is down here. 
[02:57:00]  But it's not really great.  It's all fake.  Yeah.  How do they accomplish that?  For the North Koreans.  No, I get it.  Brainwashing.  But what kind of brainwashing?  Where you get that it was all set up for you like that.  I mean, you saw the, I mean, the funeral.  Oh, yeah.  I've never seen somebody, you know, that had floods in North Korea because people are crying  so hard.  It seemed pretty genuine to me.  They said that, right?  Oh, they looked crazy.  They looked crazy.  Yeah.  So how do they brainwash them? 
[02:57:30]  Do you know?  Through fear.  To that point.  But to that point.  I wish I knew.  I wish I knew.  But I think it starts at a very young age.  Yeah.  They put the fear of God into people.  And, you know, I mean, it's extraordinary that people have been brainwashed like that.  Even in China, they weren't.  Right.  We get the brainwashing.  It's been happening around the world.  But, I mean, they take it to a whole other level.  It usually takes threats of violence and, you know, you've got to rule with an iron fist  in order to really keep your people down.  And that's what's happening with Iran.  I mean, you've got so many people that really do kind of want to be free and they're starting 
[02:58:00]  to get into social media and stuff.  But that iron hand of the government just will not even let them budge.  Boy, do they know how to squash an uprising.  You know, there's none of this like, well, the media's watching.  Let's keep it nice and maybe not look like we're really hurting that many people.  They're like, you with the camera, get the fuck out.  We're going to squash this.  Yeah.  Because you've got to remember that the Iranian government is very mindful of what happened  in 79.  The Shah actually blinked. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And that was an important lesson for this government, saying that if we show any weakness in the  way we deal with these protesters, we're history.  And it's probably true.  Yeah.  So let's go, you know.  Balls out.  Yeah.  I mean, let's go.  You've got to use every little uprising to scare the next people that might want to do  that.  Yeah.  You know, because if they see any success, they'll be like, yeah, let's continue.  Instead of, holy shit, they wiped them out.  Maybe I'll just, you know.  And that's what makes it hard.  How would you like to be the one, you know, the two guys in the corner going, okay, you're 
[02:59:00]  going to hold up the sign.  I'm going to, I mean, who wants to go first?  Yeah, yeah.  You've got to really trust that other guy.  Because, boy.  Yeah, he's just standing there.  Leaves you hanging.  Okay.  I'm going to walk down the street with a sign.  You're going to come from the other end.  Yeah.  I'm going to follow your lead.  Yeah, Seth.  That was cool.  Please, you first.  Please.  Go right ahead.  Well, North Korea, weren't they punishing people for not grieving hard enough on television?  Yeah.  Like, they were actually finding people from TV who they didn't think grieved publicly enough. 
[02:59:30]  Or if they didn't, yeah, if they thought you were, you were not genuine, yeah.  But, you know, the stuff they said about, you know, their dear leader, that he, you know,  invented the hamburger.  Oh, he was infallible.  But did you see what they did recently?  The new guy, Kim Jong-un.  Oh-un.  Oh-un, yeah.  He's purging a lot of people because he wants to establish his power base.  So they're doing things like, you know, some of the officials that he wants to get rid of, 
[03:00:00]  he can't, for whatever reason, he's just, he's staging traffic accidents.  Oh-un, Jesus.  Has a way of executing them.  For real.  Wow.  Yeah.  It's, it's, it's.  That's brilliant.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  Well, there's no traffic anyway there.  Well, are they asking questions like, why, why there was a fender bender and the bullets  were involved?  His head was found under the wheel.  But the country's so poor.  I mean, people are literally starving.  I mean, if they were wealthy and people had big houses and they say, oh, we don't want  to sort of rock the boat.  But the country is like literally starving to death. 
[03:00:30]  I mean, their malnutrition is, you know, it's killing more people than Africa, probably.  Wow.  And yet people tolerate it.  It's quite extraordinary.  You know, when do people rise up?  When do people say enough's enough?  Yeah.  So that could be your next, you could expand your television network there.  I don't know.  I'm looking at your political system here, Jonathan.  Yeah.  What do you, what do you think of that whole thing going on here?  Well, you know, the funny thing is that the difference between the U.S. and Syria's during 
[03:01:00]  their elections and your elections is that you have one more candidate.  It's quite extraordinary.  It's great.  I mean, democracy obviously is very flawed, as Churchill said, but there's nothing better  than democracy.  So, but still, it's, it's quite extraordinary that in order to make it as one of the establishment  candidates, you really have to sell, sell your soul all the way up to the top.  And when you get there, there's not much left of the, of the candidate.  No.  And, and I've always said that, that perhaps the best president that could ever be will 
[03:01:30]  never get the chance because, you know, they don't have the money.  Uh, maybe he's got a slight indiscretion in his past, but that doesn't necessarily mean  you're not going to make a good president, but we've kind of built it into this thing  where you have to have been perfect since birth.  Yeah.  Um, and the, the money involved to just get on board is, is ridiculous.  That, that's the kind of money that has to be raised that no one can come up with. 
[03:02:00]  So we're very limited as to who we get to choose as our presidents.  Uh, it doesn't seem like things ever get done.  And then you need to be the establishment figure.  And, uh, and, uh, without, but you know, I'm sure that the American public is going to  be more forgiving than what it's, you know, being given credit for.  I think that if a real leader emerges with ideas, but yet that person is flawed, I think  the public is going to be a lot more forgiving than.  It's so hard now to find somebody and, and get to the point where you actually understand 
[03:02:30]  that person, you can rally around him because so quickly the media will just start bashing  the shit out of that person, chopping them down.  It, you don't really get a chance to let the person build and kind of find out what they're  all about before you already hear 20 nasty things about the person, especially if they've  had, you know, certain indiscretions.  Well, the media, you know, is, is, is, it's the way this 24 hour news cycle is just, it's  not good for democracy. 
[03:03:00]  No, I don't.  Because everyone is focused on the next poll rather than actually fixing the country.  Yeah.  So no one actually has this blueprint for a four year plan.  It's usually a, it's, it's, it's, it's more tactical.  It's more about, you know, sprints rather than a long run.  We want the instant gratification now.  Do you know, my shot at the presidency was ruined when I was seven.  By the time I was seven, I had done enough to guarantee I would never be elected.  Do we have to break?  We got to take a break.  One more break before we go.  Um, no, we go to the end. 
[03:03:30]  Do you want to?  Okay.  That's fine by me.  I wasn't sure we had to break if we had to leverage.  Where do you live now, Saad?  Not a specific address because I'm sure people want that info, but.  They probably know it.  Uh, yeah, they do.  I'm sure they do.  I live in, um, I spend most of my time in Dubai cause we've obviously got a regional business  and, uh, and I spend two days on average, one or two days a week in Kabul.  It's only a two hour flight between Dubai and Kabul.  So I get there.  It's very quick.  And, uh, when Jim comes our way and he'll, he'll see it for himself. 
[03:04:00]  I'm scared to go there, but I might, I would probably go to Dubai first.  That's when I'm going to tiptoe into the Middle East, go up to the Burge Tower, wave a little.  Yeah.  And then Kabul?  No.  No.  You'll leave Kabul alone?  No.  How's the air travel around there?  We always, uh, we always imagine like an Indiana Jones flight with chickens on board the plane.  And well, Jonathan's had a few of those flights he's talked about.  I flew on, uh, was it Safi Airways?  Yeah.  There were chickens?  No, there weren't chickens in Safi Airways, but there was the, uh, the sign that said live 
[03:04:30]  vest under seat.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Which means what?  Not life.  Live vest.  Live vest.  Yeah.  Oh, is it a misspelling?  Yeah.  A lot of misspellings.  There's, there's, there's, there's.  No, they probably meant if you want to live, if you want to live, there's a vest to live.  Vest under seat.  Yeah.  So, do you think Jonathan's crazy like we do?  He goes to some crazy places.  Yeah, but you got to see things.  I mean, um, this is, uh, you know, the, the, the, the world is a, is a wonderful place.  I mean, the good and the ugly, both need to be seen. 
[03:05:00]  And, uh, it just puts things in perspective.  Jonathan has a passion for, for danger, for the world.  And danger is a part of it.  He's like a good diplomat.  He was telling me about Rio de Janeiro.  He went for a wedding and he's, he was, he was really traumatized by it.  He said, listen, I'd rather, much rather be in Kabul than Rio.  Wow.  Rio's dangerous.  Yeah.  I mean, it's really dangerous.  You noticed that it was dangerous.  I saw, I saw.  Because you usually don't notice, uh, the dangerous thing.  We were at a really nice hotel, for real.  I mean, uh, one of the nicest hotels in the whole country. 
[03:05:30]  Rio Copacabana?  Copacabana Palace Hotel.  Okay.  Right in front of it, uh, a girl who was, uh, part of the same wedding party that we were  at.  And literally her phone got stolen right out of her hand in front of us.  Now she reacted.  She started running after the guy.  And her husband grabs her and says, are you out of your mind?  Because the thing is, what they want you to do is run after them.  Because then the second wave comes where they then grab you and take your wallet and everything  else.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  And, uh, I mean, we saw this happen right in front of us. 
[03:06:00]  And, uh, you know, they would close off areas of the city, uh, because of, you know, in the  favelas, the, the shooting and stuff like that.  Oh, it's, wow, man.  Yeah.  Imagine getting prostitutes there.  I went three times for that and I never go back because it's too dangerous.  That's the best part.  Jim gives me a hard time about going to all these places.  Yes.  He went to Rio.  Rio.  And it was probably even more dangerous then.  To get prostitutes.  Yeah, but it was scary.  I always had a feeling of menace and that's what they thought about you too.  Yeah. 
[03:06:30]  That was scary.  It was just creep paying for our women ruining the gene pool.  But it was, uh, it was scary because you knew that you could be injured there.  It was funny because Patrice used to, when I went, I remember talking to me,  and Patrice about it and he said, do not go.  The only place you can go is the beach.  Like you can't go.  Cause I was like, I said, you know, I'm thinking about, I think I told Jim this.  I think about renting an apartment there and rather than staying in a hotel,  which my wife was really upset at that.  And you speak the language, right?  You can understand Portuguese.  No, I can speak Spanish, but I, but Portuguese, I mean, maybe a little here and there, 
[03:07:00]  but, but I go, Hey, what about renting an apartment?  And my wife goes, what?  No, we'll stay at a hotel.  And then I told Patrice and she goes, are you out of your mind?  You're not doing that.  You got to stay.  You don't leave the beach there, man.  You don't leave the beach except to go to the, the thermos.  The thermos, I think.  Yeah.  That's what, that's the brothel.  The whorehouse.  I said, well, I'm going to be with my wife.  He said, oh, can you get away?  And I was like, no.  We walked one time with me and a few other guys walk from the hotel during the day to 
[03:07:30]  the, uh, the whorehouse.  And, uh, it was probably, um, a three quarters of a mile walk, which you're crazy.  But I didn't realize how dangerous it was.  Like you'd be fine on one block and there was three or four of us walking, four guys.  And, uh, you could feel groups of guys staring at you.  And we just happened to be on a very, very main drag, uh, on that main one that, uh, that  goes in Coba Cabana.  So I think we were okay.  But as it was getting to be dusk, we were coming back to the hotel and you could feel  that if it was dark, we would have been in deep trouble. 
[03:08:00]  But New York was like that 30 years ago.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the certain blocks, if you, you know, I remember that people telling me, listen,  you can't go beyond this street.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And Washington, DC was the same.  DC is still like that.  Certain blocks are fine.  And then, um, and then you're in the walking dead and then you're fine again.  And then you're in a horrible place.  But Brazil's going to change.  I mean, it's, it's an extraordinary country and the way it's growing, it's going to be a, a sort  of economic power.  Well, you're an optimist, uh, with a lot of these, uh, places.  Yeah.  It's like, yeah, it's going to change once I get Facebook. 
[03:08:30]  It's all, uh, the best.  No, I'm from Afghanistan.  Anything looks more, you know, positive.  Everything's relative.  Well, Rio is changing for the, uh, for the Olympics.  I mean, there's a clear, the theory with, with, with Brazil is that because of the Olympics,  what they're going to do is there's this like shadowy council or whatever that's making a deal  with all the drug dealers that, you know, like, like when, uh, what was the Ali fight?  In the jungle.  Yeah.  When, uh, Ali, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, well, he went around and, and, uh, it's a hair. 
[03:09:00]  Mobutu went around and he made a deal with, he didn't make a deal.  He basically threatened everybody.  Like there was to be no violence during the period of, well, I think in Brazil, what they're  saying is, uh, listen, here's the deal.  No violence, nothing, nothing can happen while we're here.  Well, the world is here.  And, um, somehow or another, they'll cut them in, in a slice of the action, I guess.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Because there's billions of dollars.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's a war.  I mean, they had to go and actually, and it was like sending troops to get bin Laden. 
[03:09:30]  They had to send troops to get these drug dealers, drug lords.  And, um, and it's extraordinary.  The day that I arrived in Brazil, seven people were killed in a gun battle.  Okay.  In your honor.  And there was, they discovered, uh, 500 weapons.  Oh, wow.  You know.  Jonathan does this to people because he came to Afghanistan.  Remember that they blew up the Indian embassy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That killed about 70 people.  Yeah.  Wow.  Have you ever been near a bombing? 
[03:10:00]  I've seen one.  Jimmy Nort.  Well.  Yeah.  They attacked, uh, his, his TV station.  Yeah.  They sent a missile after you guys.  Oh, man.  No, no.  They were attacking the US embassy.  Unfortunately, we're not far from the US embassy and they're not good shots.  Oh, okay.  Yes.  They landed on one of our, uh, roofs and, um, and you know, it was raining, uh, bullets  for 24 hours.  Remember that they occupied the high building adjacent to the embassy?  I remember.  You know, there's so many incidents like that, but, uh, so literally people were like in 
[03:10:30]  a, in a safe house down below for like 24 hours.  Do you have a strong sense of national pride for your country or are you just kind of like  an observer?  Do you have a, do you, do you really care about the, what happens?  Absolutely.  Yeah.  I mean, Afghanistan is a, it's an old country.  It's been called Afghanistan for 250 years.  So it has a real history and the people have never been colonized.  Uh, the, the, the, you know, it was certainly not the last two centuries. 
[03:11:00]  Um, and, uh, the people as Jonathan knows, I mean, they're really decent people, very hospitable.  They're very different to every other country in the region.  Um, and they don't, you know, Kipling, I think it was the one who said that the Afghans are  the only people in Asia who don't have an inferiority complex.  Um, so they, they have a lot of pride, but yeah, they're in their own ways are very humble.  It has enormous potential to, to grow.  It's, it's given the opportunity, but it's one of those countries that everyone is meddling 
[03:11:30]  in it.  The Pakistanis, the Iranians.  Right.  Yeah.  Even you guys.  And how does that get resolved?  I wonder if they're really annoyed.  Do you think like Egypt's really annoyed that Facebook helped bring them down?  And it started by a guy named Zuckerberg.  They look at each other and go, you fucking knew it with these people.  It has to bug them that a Jewish guy started what eventually ended that.  Because it really is.  I'm serious.  That's, you know. 
[03:12:00]  But that wasn't just Facebook.  It was also, I mean, let's give Al Jazeera credit.  I mean, Al Jazeera had a huge impact in terms of the Arab Spring.  Yeah.  You know, people managing to get, you know, to get the news.  I mean, look at what's happening in Syria.  You know, killing these kids.  Yeah.  If it wasn't for, for, for the footage of these kids.  I mean, we, this, this, the reaction is mostly because of the media.  And Al Jazeera, I'm sorry, are they, are they your competition?  No.  Well, they're in Arabic.  We're not in Arabic.  And they, they do pan-regional stuff and we're more country specific. 
[03:12:30]  I mean, Al Jazeera is, it's, you know, people are critical of it, but I think it's been certainly  more good than bad over the last 10 years.  Well, there was so much support given to the revolution in Libya, but Syria is just sitting  there and getting chewed apart and no one's really popping in there and giving them a helping hand.  That's a good point.  Maybe because they don't have oil, but I mean, because I think people are scared that if we  get rid of this guy, it's a devil we know who could potentially come and replace him. 
[03:13:00]  And I think it's a serious concern people have, but, but the world, I mean, it's a big question.  I mean, I don't know the answer to this is when do we say enough's enough and we act?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It seems like a very pick and choose, but a willy nilly way they go about it.  There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason as to why you help these rebels out and why  you just leave these guys alone.  And why do we not get more involved in Africa?  And there are a lot of bad people in Africa and yet in some other parts of the world, we  get more engaged.  I think more value is put on certain people's lives than others around the world. 
[03:13:30]  I think race plays an important role.  Yeah.  And I think that's one of the things about Bosnia.  Well, it should.  Did the Saudi just get silence?  I love that.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  What's the Saudi influence in Afghanistan?  Are you asking me or something?  No, I'm asking.  Well, the Saudi state probably has, you know, has a policy that's fairly neutral, but there 
[03:14:00]  are a lot of families in the Gulf who are helping terrorists because they feel sympathetic.  And this is one of the things that has to stop.  I mean, I think this is what the Americans are also looking to do, to find out who's  funding these organizations.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They could receive hundreds of millions of dollars.  Some guy sitting in a city in the Gulf, you know, he's drinking away and, you know,  having mistresses and so forth, yet believes that ideologically the Taliban should prevail.  So they're sending money to the Taliban. 
[03:14:30]  They're sending money to Al Qaeda.  And this is another battle.  I mean, this war is being waged at so many levels.  It's a sort of a 3D conflict.  It's got so many different angles to it.  And that's why it's something that has to go on for a long time, I would say.  Yeah.  A lot of times with traditional wars, battles, civil wars, world wars, you kind of know what 
[03:15:00]  you're dealing with.  A lot of these situations with the instability in the Middle East and parts of Asia, no one  really gets it.  We don't really get a good grasp of tribal warfare.  We don't get a good grasp.  I like those.  I like when you look at a map and just see a shaded region with a name of who's there.  It's like there's no real borders.  It's just this gray blobby area.  These people are kind of in charge of it.  It just goes without saying that they're. 
[03:15:30]  So we don't really know what the end game is for a lot of these battles that are going  on.  A lot of these tribal warfare wars that are going on.  I don't think the tribal thing is, is it's not as big as people make it out to be.  Yeah.  It's actually not as complicated as, as the way it's, it's, it's basically it's, it's  put in the media.  I mean, there's an area in Pakistan, which is an, you know, it's been since the British  days, a sort of a no goes on, even in the British time, you know, the, the Fatah F-A-T-A,  which is Waziristan and those areas. 
[03:16:00]  But you know, I mean, this is one of the things and you tell Pakistan, if this is your country,  you have to reintegrate that area back into your own country and you have to introduce  laws because none of the laws in Pakistan applied to that region.  So it's autonomous.  Wow.  That's crazy.  It's like buying cigarettes at an Indian reservation.  Right, right.  You just drive in and go, holy shit.  Yeah.  So, I mean, I think that this is the thing, you know, you give them responsibility and this  is the 21st century.  You have to deal with this region.  You have to clean it up.  You have to force people to go to school. 
[03:16:30]  You have to invest in infrastructure.  But then when a country is so corrupt as Pakistan is, none of that money actually ends up with  the people.  Right.  Like 30% of the budget goes to the military.  And they're only getting ready to fight the Indians.  I mean, that military is not doing much good except, you know, you know, they're always  prepared to attack the Indians.  That seems to be the problem that we have a lot when we give money to a lot of countries.  People, people are always saying, hey, why don't you help out?  People are starving here or help out.  You know, there's a natural disaster. 
[03:17:00]  Just throw money.  Like our country loves to just throw money at shit, but has no concept that that money  is going to such a corrupt government that they're not using it to help the people.  They're using it to buy weapons and whatever else for their various wars.  I don't think we, I don't think your basic American has a understanding of that.  And I don't think the government, I think they know, but it just looks good to send money.  You know, not knowing that it's hurting, it's doing more harm than good. 
[03:17:30]  Well, I mean, you put yourself in the position of an American politician.  It's difficult to figure the entire world.  I mean, Afghanistan is one country and Pakistan is another country, but the entire world.  And the Americans, you know, are the most dominant force in the world today.  Now, how do you micromanage so many different countries with, you know, and the complexity  of the world of each country is such that, you know, you don't really have experts.  A lot of the people that we deal with, the State Department and USAID and others. 
[03:18:00]  I mean, you know, they come straight from like a country in South America to Afghanistan.  And by the time they get to know the country, they're gone.  I mean, they got another posting.  So you don't have too many experts and not many people speak the language.  It's a very, it's a huge challenge.  Is Karzai a good guy?  You know, Karzai is a very complex figure.  I think that deep down he's a nice guy.  He means well.  I think that he's a patriot.  But, you know, he's, I mean, it's a difficult job. 
[03:18:30]  Being president of Afghanistan is a lot more difficult than any other presidency.  So he's had to juggle a lot of things.  We've had a lot of issues with him.  But, but, but at the same time, you know, I sort of appreciate his predicament.  I mean, I haven't seen him for a couple of years.  He refuses to see us.  But one of the good things that's about him is that he tolerates criticism.  Does he like you?  I think deep, deep, deep, deep down he does.  You've pissed him off, haven't you?  Regularly. 
[03:19:00]  What do you think, do you think Israel will take any preemptive strikes against Iran?  And if they do, like, what do you see happening?  I don't think they will.  You don't think so?  I don't think so.  I think that if they were to do that, they wouldn't talk about it so much.  There's too much saber rattling right now.  Mm-hmm.  And they're trying to force the Iranians to do something, to, to, to actually abide by  what the international community is demanding.  Yeah.  But I think, well, you know, the, the, the, at the end of the day, you know, I mean, 
[03:19:30]  Iran is a lot more stable than Pakistan.  And Pakistan's got a hundred nuclear missiles sitting there, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Um, and, uh, and what will Iran produce two or three missiles?  And they will never, never use it against anyone in the neighborhood, especially against  Israel, because Iran will be destroyed.  So they understand the risks of doing anything like that.  But, um, and I think the Israelis are mindful that if they were to do that, the international  reaction would be pretty severe.  So I don't think anything will happen. 
[03:20:00]  They've been, they've been known to pull some shenanigans though, uh, throughout history.  Well, up until the elections, I mean, anything's possible because they could, uh, you know,  I mean, Obama's vulnerable and, you know, both candidates are vulnerable.  No one's going to actually, uh, condemn, you know, if, if Israel was to act, no one's going  to have the, the guts to condemn their action.  Yeah, yeah.  And so it, it, it, it must be tempting for them.  So we'll see.  Hmm.  Interesting, man.  Yeah.  Well, look at the time. 
[03:20:30]  10 o'clock.  We're done.  Yeah.  Uh, wow.  Oh, tomorrow, Sam's wedding.  Sam's wedding.  Wait, tomorrow.  I'll be broadcasting live from table two.  What?  No?  Shit.  Our whole goal is to ruin his special day.  His big day.  I'm wearing white spandex tight pants and I'm taking a Cialis before I go.  I'm going to destroy every wedding photo or enhance it.  It depends on what side of the fence you're on.  So, uh, good luck.  Thank you.  Yeah.  He'll, he'll need it.  Saad's in town if you wanted to invite him. 
[03:21:00]  There you go.  Yeah.  Why didn't you invite Saad?  That's what you need.  Right during the ceremony, some masked men to come in and have dunked him.  I'll only come if I can give a speech.  There you go.  That would be great.  Nice four hour speech in the middle.  On the Middle East.  We're all trying to have fun.  Right.  Come on.  Come on.  That's how you ruined the wedding.  Exactly.  You finally figured it out.  Yeah, just show like graphs and photos.  Right, right.  Sad videos.  Show footage of terrorist attacks.  Saad, what are you promoting?  Anything? 
[03:21:30]  Are you promoting anything?  No, no, nothing.  Just hanging?  He's just hanging out.  That's cool.  Thanks, man.  Yeah.  Well, he kind of wanted to promote the anti-social comedy tour.  Oh, okay.  Next Saturday, the 9th, me, Artie, Dave, and who else?  Me, Artie, Dave, and Nick DiPaolo at Foxwoods in Northern Connecticut.  And I guess we're good until Monday?  Monday, yeah.  Monday.  Thank you, everybody.  Sam will continue.  And thanks to Chris Hemsworth.  He's getting ready for his wedding.  He's getting ready for another hour.  Oh, yeah.  Chris Hemsworth. 
[03:22:00]  He's very good.  What, Snow White and the Huntsman, right?  Yes.  Opening today.  Jonathan, good seeing you, buddy.  Good to see you guys.  Nice to meet you, man.  Good meeting you guys.  Have a good weekend.  We'll see you Monday.  Bye.  You've heard about it.  You've waited four long hours for it.  And now the moment you've waited for rears its ugly nose.  Head.  After Opie and Anthony Live is coming up next.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues. 
[03:22:30]  This is After O and A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Oh, yeah.  Still here.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  I was just talking to one of our interns about his underage drinking habits.  866.  866.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  I won't tell you which one.  866-969-1969.  So you can tell me what you learned today on the Opie and Anthony show.  I feel like, I mean, how are these interns doing, Sal? 
[03:23:00]  They're cleaning up the studio.  Are they learning?  They're learning.  Quickly enough, or?  I don't know.  It's a bit of a...  They're not as good as...  You?  No.  Is that what you're going to say?  Yeah, they're not as good as me.  But, you know.  In time, they'll get it.  Do you think that any of these interns are as good as you were on your first day?  Or third day?  I noticed a lot of the same nervous jitters that I had.  Right.  I see it in them.  So, um...  You're over that now, huh?  No.  I still get nervous.  Really?  Yeah, sometimes.  I don't know. 
[03:23:30]  I'm just a silly goose.  Yeah.  Why not?  Talk on the mic.  Or talk off the mic.  It's cash, baby.  When do you get nervous?  Uh, I don't know.  If there's just something that's, uh...  Why do you get nervous?  Sal, why do you get nervous?  Sam, I'm gonna start to fucking...  Sal, answer the question.  Stop.  Stop.  You're sweating.  No, I don't know.  Um...  You get nervous when you're on the air, or you get nervous just doing stuff?  Just doing stuff sometimes, you know.  Yeah.  Work?  Work.  What did you learn on the Opie and Anthony show today?  I learned that, um...  I don't know.  I can't remember.  It's one just...  Jeff Spicoli, the intern? 
[03:24:00]  Yeah, I'm pretty bad today.  Oh my god.  Well, let's see if any of these other interns can do better.  Raise your hand if you learned something on the show today.  I didn't hear a minute on the show today.  I didn't hear any of the show.  Why don't you...  Eric, how come the...  Oh, he's answering the phones.  Don't worry about it.  How come none of the interns...  I was doing work over there.  Microphone.  None of you guys listen to the show?  Uh...  It's great.  Well, I was listening to...  You should check it out sometime.  A lot of it's funny, and today, like...  I was listening to the Worst Of clips.  I heard the show today.  So was I.  Yeah, you guys were listening to Worst Of?  What for? 
[03:24:30]  What do you listen to Worst Of for?  Um...  I don't know.  I was listening to you listen to Troy Have Sex, though.  Right.  That was pretty funny.  Thank you very much.  But you don't know why you were listening to it?  I was just listening to it.  We were typing in on an Excel document what they were about.  It was to...  How big was it?  Describe.  This Excel document.  I didn't even know.  Good one, right?  Yeah.  So what, do you make descriptions of the Worst Of?  I guess so.  You didn't know that one, though.  And what about you, Connor?  What did you learn on the show? 
[03:25:00]  Oh, you caught me off guard.  Um...  It took him 15 seconds to say you caught me off guard.  What did you learn, now that you're on guard?  Uh...  You said, I listened to the show.  You were like this.  I was talking to the other two, and you go, I was listening to the show.  Like, who are these fucking jamokes that you got me paired up with?  I listened to the show.  So what did you learn?  I just learned to keep my mouth shut.  We didn't talk about that on the show at all.  What did you learn on the show?  Anything? 
[03:25:30]  Nothing?  Um...  No, I learned that, um...  Oh, you know what?  What did you learn?  What did you learn, Rob?  Go ahead.  Rob the intern.  Today is National Donut Day.  Two points for Rob.  That was good.  You know what I learned?  What?  In New Jersey.  I'll talk to him about that, what he's done on the phones in a second.  Connor, you gonna let Rob steal it from you?  Uh...  No.  And he didn't even listen to the show.  Wow.  You caught off guard.  That actually...  Did I have one more time off guard? 
[03:26:00]  That actually does sting.  Yeah.  Um...  I learned that you're getting married, actually.  You just...  I didn't pay attention, really, yesterday.  I was just focused on getting everything done.  I've been talking about that for about a year and a half.  I gotta be honest with you.  I don't have SiriusXM, they cancelled my account.  Huh?  You've been engaged for a year and a half.  On the mic.  I'm just talking to him.  Yeah, we're just chatting.  What is there, an audience?  Yeah, I was engaged for a year and a half.  Oh, alright.  What's the problem with that?  I don't know.  It's not like a weekend thing.  Usually people, it's like six months, like something like that.  I don't know, that's just what I figured.  You think it's six months? 
[03:26:30]  I don't know.  You got any prospective fiancés in the future?  Yeah.  Do you do?  You have somebody that's...  Yes.  Who's that?  Is it your girl you've been dating?  I haven't decided yet.  Is it your girl you've been dating?  No.  You're single?  I'm just gonna go pick someone up on the street.  Okay, now you're just doing bits and jokes.  I love Berserker.  Is that his name?  Berserker?  He looks like the Berserker, the wrestler.  You should wear a Viking helmet from now on.  I'm gonna call my cousin Olaf and I'm gonna get a Russian mail-order bride.  Oh, I don't know what he's talking about anymore, Travis. 
[03:27:00]  This is Olaf.  The Berserker guy.  He's from Russia.  Alright, 1996.  We got it.  Were you even born when that movie came out?  How old were you when Mallrats came out?  You remember when that movie came out, right, Travis?  Three.  I was three.  You were three years old when Mallrats came out?  Three years old.  How does that make you feel, Travis?  Old.  Me too.  Yeah.  Me too.  Connor, what did you learn on the show tonight?  Third time.  God damn it.  I'm gonna go ahead and just go to the calls.  Connor, you get a big fail for today.  Alright. 
[03:27:30]  You get a grade of zero.  Alright.  Alright.  Kevin, I'll go, Rob, you get an 80.  Yes.  It's passing.  It's more than passing.  Kevin.  It's a C plus.  You get an 84.  Yes.  Still good.  Still beat you, Rob.  You got some stuff, because he's good on his feet.  You're not as good.  Congratulations on getting married tomorrow.  Thank you very much.  Kevin gets an 84, though, because he's got the improv chops.  Understandable.  You understand.  Rob doesn't get points for, like, looks?  No, he had an 87 before, and then the looks run down to an 84. 
[03:28:00]  Bill in Boston, what did you learn?  Sam, I learned two things today.  Mm-hmm.  Not all Middle Eastern people hate the actual American people.  Yeah.  And you have such a need for attention that, despite your fiancé's wishes, you're still  there.  How about, I have a need to entertain you, Bill?  Why would you, I'm sitting here giving you a new live show, and you're gonna insult  me for entertaining you?  I'm not, I'm not insulting you, Sam.  Oh, I thought you were gonna say, I'm not entertained.  Come on, you. 
[03:28:30]  Thank you.  Thank you, Bill.  Um, yeah, I thought that guy, uh, I don't know how to pronounce his name.  Do you have any idea how to pronounce?  Saad?  Saad?  Saad.  Saad.  Saad, he was in here, and, uh, what's Berserker doing over there?  What are you doing over there, Berserker?  Very comfortable.  I'm listening.  Oh, okay, good for you.  I hope you enjoy the show.  We have to do, I'm doing most of your job, you realize that, right?  He's listening.  Let him give the show a listen.  What do you do?  Well, that wasn't cleaned up.  Yeah.  The headphones aren't replaced.  Someone should be on phones.  I'll get phones. 
[03:29:00]  Why?  Because phones include sitting down.  I really like these guys.  So do I.  I really like them.  It's your first class.  What's up?  It's your first class.  Yeah, I love anyone that has to get food as opposed to me.  You'll never forget your first class.  Yeah.  You won't.  Right?  No, you won't.  Absolutely not.  Other than you guys.  Well, no, it's not that better.  Yeah, you are.  They're doing a lot of work that I don't have to do anymore.  Exactly.  He's the best.  Berserker.  Yes.  He is the best.  But Saad was in here and he blew my mind today because I can't, it's like he's describing 
[03:29:30]  a culture that is so alien to us.  It's like it's a different world.  You don't even realize that, like this is a guy who's actually got human experience  living in the Middle East and like talking about Afghanistan and he's a business entrepreneur  in Afghanistan.  Yeah, and it's weird because I've talked to a couple people that have lived there.  Like I used to talk to this person online who lived in Israel and it's just, you know, 
[03:30:00]  a normal place where they've just got some, you know, terrorist activity here and there,  but it's just another normal place and you don't think of it like that.  Right.  Like it's just like, yeah, there's some terrorist attacks, but other than that we just live.  Yeah, other than that I go to school, I go to work, I go to the mall and everything's cool.  Even in, when I was living in England, like there were just little things that were different.  It wasn't any terrorist activity, but because of like the IRA and stuff like that, it was,  a bomb scare was as common as a fire drill.  So like once or twice a year we'd go home early because there was a bomb scare. 
[03:30:30]  We'd go, yay, bomb scare, we get to go home.  And you have some kinder eggs.  And we had kinder eggs because, I don't know, those aren't allowed in the United States.  No, they're highly illegal.  I guess that's part of our jingoistic view on the world.  But you know what?  I mean, really, I'd rather live in a place where terroristic violence was a foreign concept  than a place where we just accept it as a reality.  Let's see, Joe in Long Island, what did you learn?  Hey Sam, first of all, congratulations.  Thank you. 
[03:31:00]  But I did learn that despite what your fiancee says, you will not be cutting your hair or  shaving your eyebrows before your wedding.  First of all, if I shaved my eyebrows, I think she'd be horrified.  And second of all, no, she's marrying me, so I'm going to look like me.  I don't understand why, like people have actually asked me,  why aren't you going to cut your hair for your wedding?  And I'm like, my fiancee has been living with me for the last, however, four years  or however long it's been with my hair looking like this.  Like, she obviously approves. 
[03:31:30]  Yeah, this wasn't like a build-up to you getting married.  No!  It's not like, hey babe, I'll cut my hair when we get married.  Yeah, no, not at all.  And you would look so weird.  I would look like a totally different person.  Absolutely.  It would just be strange.  People still think it's a bit.  There's no bit.  I just have long hair.  That's the thing.  When are you going to cut your hair?  I don't want to.  How about never?  Or, I don't know, when I want to.  JP in New York.  What's up, buddy?  Hello, young Sam.  What did you learn?  I learned that I didn't even get to listen to the show today. 
[03:32:00]  And I can still play the shit show game better than the interns.  Yeah, these interns have got to pick their game up a little bit, because I asked them  the question, what did you learn?  And they looked at me like, I have three heads.  What?  Learn?  No.  Yeah.  From what?  Matt in Ohio.  Hey, love you.  Love the show.  Thanks, man.  And congratulations.  Thanks.  I learned that your dad keeps a spreadsheet for every dime he's ever lent you.  He does.  He likes to keep track of all money that he's spending, whether it be on his children 
[03:32:30]  or on other things.  He is guided by numbers.  Mike in Philly.  Hey, Sam.  Congratulations on the wedding.  Thanks.  I learned today that little people think we're gods.  That was really funny.  And you could, Jim credited David Tell with the line, of course.  He did one of David Tell's jokes saying, you know, little people, if they're little,  if they can be credited as people, we should be credited as gods.  What David Tell really is.  I mean, I think that anybody who, for a second, didn't think David Tell was one of, if not 
[03:33:00]  the funniest guys to come on the show, that Patrice special, the one line where he said  we have a giant coffin in a purple suit to pay for, was it.  Like, that explains everything.  Andy in Cleveland, what did you learn?  I learned, Timmy.  You're a very, very brave individual, being as steeped in tradition as you are, and your  family is, to invite Anthony, your boss, ergo your lord, to the wedding. 
[03:33:30]  Where he could invoke the ancient custom of Dwar the Senor and actually take Jess on your wedding night.  Well, here's the thing, Andy.  I appreciate the job, and I love everything that I do here.  But, I would probably object if Anthony came to my wedding and said, Sam, I'm your boss.  I get to have sex with your bride.  Well, regardless, Sam, congratulations to you. 
[03:34:00]  And, Jess, if you're listening, our thoughts are with you in this moment of sadness.  I'm glad that you are looking out for both of our interests there.  Thank you, Andy.  Um, cigars and scotch.  Hey, Sam, I just wanted to warn you, do not invite Jake the Snake Roberts to your wedding.  He's awful at these things, and don't let Jess open any gifts from him.  You're right.  What a good reference.  Thank you, cigars and scotch.  No problem.  Good luck.  Thank you.  Miss Elizabeth learned that the hard way. 
[03:34:30]  Jake the Snake brings a gift, and guess what?  It's a motherfucking cobra that jumps out at her.  I thought Jake the Snake Roberts was a good, decent, honest guy.  And, all of a sudden, there's a snake jumping out of the box.  That's a great reference.  It really is.  Thank God Sid Justice was there.  You think Eric enjoyed that one?  Eric, you like that?  Very much so.  Cigars and scotch are always up for a good one.  Um, are those for the listeners?  No, this is just that Gerard Butler's new movie.  Oh!  She got preachers out on Blu-ray next week.  You just learned to plug it because you have a crush on Gerard Butler? 
[03:35:00]  I do.  Um.  Plus, he's awesome.  Jim in PA.  Plus, he's awesome.  Yeah.  What's up?  What did you learn?  Congratulations on your nuptials.  Thank you.  And I learned that you're pretty frugal.  Instead of renting a tux, you got a suit that you can wear over and over again.  It makes sense, doesn't it?  I'm a logical guy.  Absolutely.  I did at my wedding, so.  Right.  You get it.  Thank you, Jim.  Yeah.  And it's a very nice suit.  So, let's not get, you know.  Um.  Eric in Ohio.  How about you? 
[03:35:30]  I learned that the Taliban has about the same approval rating as Congress.  Yeah.  That's, I mean, we're not terribly happy with our people over here either.  Uh.  The Phantom is on the phone.  Roland.  First of all, I gotta say mazel tov.  Thank you.  Uh.  And I gotta, you know, bone to pick with you, buddy.  What's that?  I emailed you maybe two months ago.  I know you got a lot of things in your mind.  Right.  But I have a wrestling radio podcast.  Mm-hmm.  And I wanted you to become a, you know, guest interview.  And I haven't heard one thing from you. 
[03:36:00]  I haven't heard, yeah, I'll get back here after the wedding.  Yeah, after the honeymoon.  Nothing.  Nothing.  I intend to do it.  I like doing it.  I'm a 50-year-old, I'm a 50-year-old guy.  Yeah.  I'm not famous or anything.  You know, I'm, I'm, you know, this is, this, I've been saying Sam Roberts is coming  on the show for about four weeks.  Sorry about ruining your place.  And it's not, and no offense, it's not even like, I'm saying, you know, Hogan is coming  on.  No, it's not.  Sam Roberts.  And people are like, when is Sam coming on?  They're asking about me?  He's coming on soon.  They're saying, when is Sam Roberts coming on? 
[03:36:30]  I said, he's coming on soon, I think.  I mean.  Yeah.  Did you get my email?  No.  Yeah.  I think I remember it.  I have just not been responding to people.  I've been doing a wedding and 19 radio shows.  I'll do it.  I like doing wrestling.  Huh?  You are a dick.  Yeah.  That is a dick move.  But I like doing wrestling podcasts.  I did, I did the Shining Wizards wrestling podcast.  I don't know if you know who they are.  I didn't know who they were, but they do a wrestling.  Well, go to their website and why don't you download the show that I did with them and just 
[03:37:00]  play that.  I could insert questions there.  Yeah.  My own questions and use your responses to them.  Well, like what are you going to ask me about?  I don't know.  Well, you have no idea.  I would, I would just, I would just try to get Opie eventually on.  So that's how I would.  On your wrestling podcast?  Yeah.  He liked wrestling back in the day.  I mean, he barely did.  He really didn't.  He's not, he doesn't.  Unless, unless.  I was on the show once.  I got on the show once. 
[03:37:30]  Yeah.  And they were talking about some fake iron sheet guy who was doing comedy in New York.  Mm-hmm.  And I told him I was there.  We had a nice little laugh about Stephanie's implants.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, yeah.  He knows Stephanie McMahon has implants.  Unless you know, unless your, your interview is focused on the Polish hammer, Ivan Putzky.  Scott Putzky.  Or the late Chief Jay Strongbow.  Right.  We're big Scott Putzky fans.  No, he's all about Ivan Putzky.  All right.  All right.  Well, listen, how about after, send me another email. 
[03:38:00]  Just send me another email.  Enjoy the wedding.  Listen, enjoy the wedding.  It only happens once.  Right.  And if you need a good videographer, let me know.  I will.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Can you be there tomorrow?  Much mazel.  All right.  Later, man.  No, I'm not using a videographer.  I got two flip cams and a camcorder and a tripod.  Oh, you're giving away a machine game preacher on Blu-ray.  This comes out this Tuesday.  Now, am I giving it away or did you just sneak in a plug?  I just sneaked in a plug.  Okay. 
[03:38:30]  No.  I'm going to figure out who's going to.  There's a couple of the wedding guests are going to be videographers.  Do they know this?  No, I don't know who it is yet.  I don't.  I don't know.  It's definitely gonna be somebody in my family, though, because I gotta get somebody.  Can't you Rob the intern?  I got.  No, he's not coming.  Get somebody in the front row to hold a flip cam.  So maybe my mom.  I don't think she's gonna want to do that.  Well, you know what?  We all make sacrifices.  What about your brother?  No, because he's the best man, so he'll be up there.  Oh.  You know, I'll set up the tripod so nobody has to.  What about Anthony?  No, because he'll be like filming his balls or something the whole time. 
[03:39:00]  Yeah, but you could have an interesting perspective on your wedding.  It will be interesting.  Oh, you see like a couple of Jack Daniels going up and down?  Yeah, exactly.  They'll be just alcohol, sticky alcohol spilled on it.  I won't get anything off of it.  Josh, in Boston, what did you learn?  Yeah, I just wanted to let you know that once you guys get married, ask any guy that's married.  The women, especially once they have kids, they stop having sex, stop anything.  Travis, is that true?  No. 
[03:39:30]  No, okay.  I just asked somebody and he said it's specifically not true.  And Travis has a kid and he's married.  And he's still sexually active, he says.  Yeah.  So, I'm gonna go with you on that one, Travis.  You go, he's still sexually active.  Yeah.  Eric, has the sex life decreased since marriage?  No.  Do you think it'll decrease?  What about since Legos?  What about since Legos?  Legos start after Sam's wedding.  Oh, okay.  Sex life has decreased since the Legos, but that's because Eric's been busy.  He's been building Legos.  He doesn't have time.  I sorted them yesterday.  Yes. 
[03:40:00]  Is this something you're looking forward to really digging your teeth into?  Yes.  Don't eat the pieces, Eric.  I was just gonna say, I hope your cat eats like one piece that you can't finish something  with.  Oh, man.  No, it's in a room she can't get to.  Do you think that sex will slow down after kids?  Is that something you're worried about?  I don't know.  I don't think it will.  According to Bethany getting married, it slows down for at least 10 weeks.  Who?  Bethany getting married.  Bethany getting married.  Yeah.  Your brother.  Oh, that's the desperate or the real housewife.  Yeah. 
[03:40:30]  Is it true?  Yeah, never mind.  If it's not true, then I shouldn't make that announcement myself.  I love the show.  Um.  So just wait 10 weeks afterwards.  It'll be fun.  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  Thank you for the advice, Roland.  I'm glad I have you in my life.  Hey, Jason.  He sets in his little dear diary because after 10 weeks everything went back to normal.  What did you learn, Mario?  Sammy boy, congratulations on your wedding.  Thank you.  Double guns, baby.  Double guns.  And by the way, there is a table place card for Lyle Chip Chibberson and Paul Hargis because 
[03:41:00]  that's who was on the RSVP.  Exactly.  I, uh, what I learned today was that Roland will make up-  Tell someone to answer the hotline.  Sorry to interrupt you, Mario.  Go ahead.  Tell Berserker.  Berserker!  Just ringing.  Just ringing.  Go ahead, Mario.  I learned that Roland made up a worse excuse to not be at E-Rock's wedding than the actual  truth.  That was funny, Roland.  I mean, you were like, you know, the whole point- I mean, the point of the conversation  was that Anthony knows shows weddings and that's why he's got- that's why I was wondering 
[03:41:30]  whether or not he was going to show up.  But I said that I thought Eric's wife was annoyed that you didn't show up to his wedding.  And, uh, and I brought up my bachelor party too and it was all, you know, cause for  a year and a half, or however long it's been since Eric got married, it's been like,  oh man, Roland was kind of a dick for not showing up.  Cause you went on the air and said, well, Harry Potter's gonna be on.  Yeah.  Avoid- avoid- avoid talking about it.  So people go, I want an asshole and you guys move on.  And then- and we did move on, but like, we brought it back up and today, you just squashed  it just like that.  You had a medical issue you drew- you were dealing with- with your parents. 
[03:42:00]  Guess what?  Acceptable reason to not be there.  Yeah, but if these are people that ask too many questions, what's wrong?  Is he okay?  Just saying this-  You don't want to talk about it at the time.  Just saying this, they go, what a dick.  Roland would have much rather come off as the biggest asshole in the world.  Than be at all sympathetic.  Yeah.  Um, everything is okay now though?  Yeah.  That's great.  Uh, and Eric.  Yeah.  Do you forgive Roland for not being there?  Well, I can't argue with the fact-  I didn't ask if you argued.  Do you forgive him for not being there?  I don't forgive the way he handled it, but I forgive the reason why he was gone. 
[03:42:30]  What's wrong with the way you handle it?  Isn't it all in good fun now that everything's out in the open?  Yeah, I still feel bad.  I mean, that's the way he handled it.  I do.  I mean, I would have loved to gone.  Yeah.  I'm sure you would have.  You'll have, whatever.  You'll have fun with him at my wedding.  And you, you know, it's a celebration for both of us.  Do you forgive Roland?  Yeah, why not?  Well, please, could you tell him?  Roland's forgiven.  No, could you say, Roland, I forgive you?  I just did.  No, you said Roland's forgiven.  That's what you're getting.  No, you said Roland's forgiven as if Roland's not even in the room.  I pardon you.  Could you talk to him like a friend, like Roland's feeling alone? 
[03:43:00]  It's fine.  Don't be a woman.  Like Bethany says.  Like Bethany says?  Yeah.  Does Bethany say don't be a woman?  Well, it's a Sunday.  I woke up early and saw like from like 8 a.m. to like 8 p.m. like the whole marathon.  Of Bethany getting married?  Yeah.  Did she get married?  The cherries are married, but I know shit though.  If you need advice, I'm here for you.  Because of the Bethany show?  Yeah.  Roland watched a marathon and he's got it all under control.  Yeah.  He figured it out.  If Jess doesn't match you, this means she might be in her time of month. 
[03:43:30]  Let her go.  Okay, you learned that from Bethany or just that people know when women are on their periods,  they get bitchy?  From Bethany.  Oh.  I think Eric should show his forgiveness to Roland by buying him lunch.  No, I'll buy Eric lunch.  No, that's not how it works.  And Eric, will you accept Roland's lunch that he's purchasing for you?  If he's purchasing for me, yes.  I love when friends come back together.  I'll purchase lunch for Eric and you, Sam.  I gotta go.  I don't want it though.  I know because I know Sam has to go. 
[03:44:00]  Bobby in Connecticut.  Good morning, Samuel.  How are you?  I'm very good.  How about you, Bobby?  Alright.  Congratulations on the wedding.  Condolences to Jess.  Thank you very much.  What I learned on the show today was that Mayor Bloomberg can't decide whether he should  put an eclair in his mouth or in his ass.  That's true.  Thank you, Bobby.  If Roland had any DVDs, I would have given him one.  That was funny.  Because you can get Machine Gun Preacher this Tuesday at Amazon.com.  Oh, okay.  So you're just telling where to get it.  Yeah. 
[03:44:30]  This is what it gets sent to me.  Just like winning one.  You're opening it up now?  Yeah.  It's heavy.  It's a heavy one.  What's it?  Three discs or whatever?  Three or four discs, yeah.  Four discs?  Machine Gun Preacher?  Yeah, it's awesome.  Good Lord.  Did you have a movie when it was out?  Yeah, it was really good.  That's when Gerard came in here to promote it.  Yeah, I remember that.  He was a good guest.  He sent me back soon, too.  Yeah?  He sent me an email.  Eric, what do you think of Bloomberg's...  You're kind of the food expert.  You and Roland.  I'll ask Roland in a minute.  He's a fucking asshole.  Who's a fucking...  Bloomberg? 
[03:45:00]  Yeah.  You're pissed about it.  Well, actually, it's smart, though.  It helps the restaurants.  I'll save money on drinks.  Right, hey.  I'm sorry.  Hey, all we can do is 16-ounce, but go ahead and buy two if you want.  Yeah, and so the restaurants will just charge more, so...  Economically, but you don't think that this is a...  No.  But what you're forgetting, too, is that...  Alright, so you can't get a 32-ounce or whatever.  That's right.  But there's certain places, like Dunkin' Donuts and 7-Eleven, where they charge a fee if you  brought your own container in.  Yeah.  Oh, that's true, yeah.  So, like, if you went to Dunkin' Donuts and had your own, like, insulated coffee thing... 
[03:45:30]  Yeah, but...  Can you get, like, a sugary drink in that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can?  Yeah.  Like, 7-Eleven does it, where if you have your own container like that, there's a set fee  or something that they charge you, and you fill up your drink.  Yeah.  In your own cup, and they're not technically selling you a 32-ounce, 64-ounce, whatever.  You're just doing a fill-up.  And plus, 44 ounces of coffee, I think, is worse.  Yeah, it probably is.  Because of the caffeine, the sugar, you're like, yeah!  What's the large equivalent at Starbucks? 
[03:46:00]  Is it Vente?  Oh, no, they have that one they tried out.  I think it was 33-ounce.  It's like a super...  Jesus Christ.  No, but their regular one.  Oh, Vente.  Vente.  That was in one of the news articles saying that, like, the Vente Frappuccino, whatever that  stuff is, that they're not even going to be able to sell that.  You have to get a smaller version of it, and that's what people buy all the time around  here.  So the deal is, Mayor Bloomberg, who's the mayor of New York City...  He's an asshole.  Yeah, he's a dick.  He wants to put out this ban on...  It's basically for sodas and Hawaiian punch, I guess too, soft drinks. 
[03:46:30]  That's like 50 grams of sugar.  Who...  Large ones.  So, people will only be able to buy 16-ounce drinks.  That'll be the maximum.  So, KFC can't do their big 46-ounce, whatever.  7-Eleven can't do their big gulps anymore.  And his theory, you can buy two 16- ounces, you just can't buy one 32-ounce.  It's...  Health concerns or whatever that they're trying to play it off as, it's...  They're really dicking you over to spend more money.  Now, would having to buy two 16-ounce drinks stop you? 
[03:47:00]  No, it's like going to the Prudential Center.  You only can buy two beers, the minimum.  Yeah.  So, what you do is buy two beers, and then you go to the next person and go,  two more beers...  And you just keep going.  So, it doesn't work at all.  You're going to do the beer line at 7-Eleven.  Yeah!  What about...  So, Eric, you would buy...  You would just get...  If you wanted a large drink, you'd just get two.  Um...  I don't usually get the open container stuff, like at 7-Eleven, but if...  Like, if I did, it would be like the super big gulp, which I think is the 32-ounce. 
[03:47:30]  Mm-hmm.  So, yeah, you'd have to get...  I don't know if I'd buy two.  I mean...  It might stop you?  You're going to walk around with two fucking cups?  Or you might...  Or would you just buy a second one after you finish the first one?  Well, you can take your same cup back and get a refill.  Oh, yeah?  So, you just walk around...  You guys are beverage experts.  Yeah.  You should do it on road trips.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You stop at McDonald's, you get a large soda, and then you just drive, and then you stop  at another McDonald's because it's free refill.  You just hand it in your cup.  You could go from here to Florida and only pay for one drink.  You're right. 
[03:48:00]  Now, I ask you this, Eric.  Why did you, when Opie and Anthony talked to you about this, did you give them the response  that resulted in Opie screaming at you and telling him how dumb you are?  That's hilarious.  Yeah, I think he overreacted on that.  He got really mad at you.  I thought it was funny by the fact that it's not going to affect me.  It's hilarious.  I live in New Jersey.  I thought that was funny.  But what he was looking for was a conversation about it, because you don't have that clip,  do you?  No, I don't have an idea.  Okay.  Because Opie goes...  Listen to the replay.  Yeah, it's at 3 o'clock. 
[03:48:30]  Opie goes...  Eastern time, of course.  Opie goes, Eric, would you just get two 16-ounce drinks?  And Eric goes, well, this isn't going to affect me.  I live in Jersey.  And Opie flipped out on him because Opie was looking...  I think that's funny.  Fuck this.  It's not going to affect me.  Looking to further the conversation, though, and that's like being on stage to improv.  And a guy being like, Eric, you're getting on a school bus.  And you being like, there's no school bus here.  That's funny.  And he's like, what the fuck am I supposed to do with this then? 
[03:49:00]  You get yelled at if they ask you stupid questions and you give a serious answer.  But the rare time they ask you a serious question and you try to give a joke answer,  they yell at you for that as well.  Who's on the highlight?  All you can do is answer honestly.  Oh my goodness.  Look at this.  Otto!  Sammy!  What's up, buddy?  Well, Trish just told me you're getting married.  I had no idea.  I just wanted to say congratulations and best of luck and no jokes or anything.  Just that's awesome.  And Trish is like, you should call in.  You know, she's all about getting my stupid name said again on the air. 
[03:49:30]  I wish you the best.  That's great.  Well, thank you very much.  It means a lot.  You got big plans on honeymoon and all that shit?  Well, we're going on a little trip next week.  But we're only going to go for like three or four days.  And then we're going to Hawaii like later in the summer.  That's ridiculous.  Wow.  Hawaii.  Everybody goes there, says they want to buy a house there.  So how long have you known this lady?  Seven years almost.  Oh, that's good.  That's a nice long time.  Yeah, I've known her for a while. 
[03:50:00]  We've been living together forever, so.  Oh, in Sydney.  Are you planning on having children?  At some point, but not immediately.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know if you've heard, but SiriusXM does not exactly make producers rich here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can't throw rice because it kills pigeons.  So...  Is that right?  Anthrax is a good substitute.  Anthrax.  Yeah.  A nice big anthrax for the in-laws.  Oh, that's awesome.  Yeah.  You got anything going on this weekend?  You could plug. 
[03:50:30]  I mean, you could...  I don't think you called just to plug, but that doesn't mean you can't plug.  Well, this weekend I'm doing a private party in Tom's River, and then next week I'm  at Bananas both Friday and Saturday in Hasbrok Heights at the Holiday and the Cock.  Cool.  Cool, man.  Well, thank you for the well wishes.  It's good to hear from you.  Thanks, Sam, and thanks, Trish, for always trying to keep my career alive.  Yeah.  Thank you, Trish.  Have a great weekend.  Thanks, Sam.  All right.  I'll talk to you later.  Bye. 
[03:51:00]  Bye.  Also, puppiesandsunshine.com for Otto's podcast.  Right, yeah.  Check out the podcast.  What were you saying?  That's ridiculous?  It's ridiculous, because I've been thinking about this for the last couple of days.  You didn't take off today to get set up for your wedding.  No.  But you're off next week, except for Friday, where you're coming back.  No, I'm literally, like, after this, like, as soon as I'm off the air here, I gotta grab  my bags and go, and I'll literally show up.  Oh, but he's gonna beat you there.  He will.  I will literally show up as the rehearsal is starting.  Like, that's the plan right now. 
[03:51:30]  What time's your rehearsal?  To 1.30.  Dude.  Aw, you're fucked.  Yeah, well, we'll see.  We'll see what happens.  But everybody, but like, yesterday, I went to dinner with my family, and like, my sister  goes, well, aren't you worried about showing up late for the rehearsal?  And I looked at her, I was like, in case you didn't realize, this is my show.  There is no me showing up late.  The rehearsal starts when I get there.  It's impossible for me to be late.  It'd be great if they have stand-ins.  Yeah.  Opie's just there as the stand-in.  Why is your rehearsal so early? 
[03:52:00]  Usually they do it towards the end where you go right into a dinner.  Yeah, that's the point.  Because we do it at, we're doing it.  That's like a lunch.  We're not going.  It's a brunch.  It's like appetizers.  Roland, it's not a meal.  It's a rehearsal.  We're doing dinner later.  You go to the rehearsal just to go to the dinner.  No.  Stand there, stand there.  Here's appetizers.  Jesus.  We're doing the rehearsal, because there's another wedding at the venue.  So we had to do it before that wedding.  Oh, today?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, okay.  But yeah, so I'm leaving here right after this.  You should do the rehearsal during their wedding.  And then, yeah.  Just say, do what they do.  Stand behind them. 
[03:52:30]  Just shadow the bride and groom.  Yeah.  Just do what they do and then leave.  Go have lunch.  You're always about the meals.  My steak better be cooked right.  I have to send that shit back tomorrow.  Send it back.  Roland's been a little bit obsessed by the fact that I guess you guys discussed that there  should be ice cream there.  Yes.  Nobody discussed that.  You just started texting me or tweeting me or something.  Yeah, so where's the ice cream cake?  There's an ice cream cake.  It's wedding cake.  It's not ice cream cake.  I said good morning to him and he goes, there better be ice cream there.  Yeah.  I don't think there's going to be ice cream. 
[03:53:00]  That's bullshit then.  How many weddings do you go to with ice cream?  How many weddings that they should have ice cream?  Okay.  That's a good point.  How many weddings should there be ice cream is what he said.  Yeah.  And then next week, yeah, I'm going to be back on Thursday.  I'll be back in town.  So I'm going to do the show on Friday.  Why would I take the day off?  Why come in for the last day of the week?  Listen.  Why don't you just take, you're taking the whole week off as it is.  Because...  Plus he has an interview Friday. 
[03:53:30]  Do I?  Who am I interviewing?  OJ.  Oh, nice.  Love it.  Love it.  Yeah, and I have an interview that day.  But in my mind, I believe the only way to get very good at something is to do it a lot.  I'm not going to pass up.  Listen, when I was 15, if somebody had been like, yo, you can go do your own radio show  or you can be on the Opie and Anthony show, I would have been like, that's fucking awesome.  I wouldn't have been like, no, I'm taking Friday off. 
[03:54:00]  I would have been like, yes.  That's totally different than the week of getting married.  No way, dude.  Yes.  If I was a teen, when I was in high school, if you had been like, yeah, I know you're on your honeymoon, but...  I can't compare that.  That's you in high school.  It's still awesome.  It is awesome.  Just because...  But you're getting married.  Yeah, but you know what?  This isn't about just you.  Well, what am I going to just sit home and look at Jess?  She'll be there when I get home.  Is she working that Friday?  No, no, no.  She's taking the day off.  So why don't you spend the time with her? 
[03:54:30]  She's probably got stuff to do.  I don't know what she's going to do.  But you know what?  I can come in here and like, do some cool shit.  And entertain the people.  And hear from...  And it is...  You know what?  If you mop through all the people that don't realize that Ant and Jim are just kidding around.  On my Twitter, finally today, I'm getting all these wonderful well wishes.  There are some wonderful people who listen to this show.  And those are my people, Eric.  Yes, I understand.  I need to be with my... 
[03:55:00]  It's not about them.  Yes, it is.  I need to be with my people.  It's not about them right now.  It's not.  It's about you and your new bride.  Let me ask you one thing, Sam.  What's that?  Are you going to do the one-sheets for Monday?  Because we have a busy show.  Fuck that.  What an asshole.  That's all you, Road Dog.  What about the kid?  Tell the high school kid to do it, you dumbass.  Which high school kid?  The one you were just talking about.  Who?  That's so exciting.  If I told the high school kid, tell him to do the one-sheets.  Yeah.  You get to do the one-sheets for celebrities.  Fuck that.  Who do we have on Monday?  That's really funny. 
[03:55:30]  Monday is Anthony Bourdain, Paul Williams, and Uriah Faber.  Jesus.  I know.  Tell the 15-year-old kid to do the one-sheets.  All right.  Nick, you're on After Open Anthony Live.  Hey, I just wanted to say a couple things.  One, I live on the West Coast, and at first I was getting disappointed that I didn't get  to hear ONA.  Yeah.  But I've fallen in love with your show.  I love that.  Thank you for that.  Yeah.  Thank you. 
[03:56:00]  My wife and I have been together for 12 years, and don't listen to everyone else.  It's up to you if you have a good relationship and good sex.  Right.  You're still banging all the time?  Oh, yeah.  All the time.  All the time.  That's what I'm talking about.  I basically walk around with her on my penis.  That's what I'm talking about.  That's the life I want to lead.  Exactly.  The third thing, just to quick go back to the soda thing.  What soda thing?  About the mayor changing the law. 
[03:56:30]  Right.  I think that his plan is going to work because you guys were talking about ways to get around  it.  You are free-thinking, clever individuals.  Remember that most of America are sheep, and if they change a rule, if the government  changes the rule, the people will complain about it for a little while, and then they'll  just be like, oh, well, I can only get a 16-ounce drink, and that's all they'll ever buy.  That's probably right.  Most people would probably not put two and two together and realize that you could get 
[03:57:00]  two drinks.  They'd just be like, oh, that's as big as they come?  Well, then that's...  Bring your own cup.  That's what I'll get.  Enough with the bring your own cup, Eric.  They're not going to do that.  People, then they would have to plan ahead.  Yeah.  The plan will work, and it is the beginning of the nanny state that everyone's always  talking about, but I think that it will cause a reduction in obesity that's noticeable  in New York, and then other cities are going to see it, and they're going to start adopting 
[03:57:30]  similar rules.  Alright.  Thanks, Nick.  And Nick's probably right.  Sorry, buddy.  Nick's probably right.  It probably will decrease instances of obesity, but it will increase the fact that the government  is now controlling how much soda we can drink.  And then you'll get a ticket if you're walking around with, you know, a larger container.  Hey, that's a...  Listen, Eric.  Nagel.  What?  We've talked to you about this before.  We've written you up for those 20-ounce bottles.  Fuck you, pig!  Yeah.  Just walking around with a 20-ounce like it's a can of spray paint.  Or do what they do now? 
[03:58:00]  Like, Gucci and Prado will have like a purse, but it's actually like a container filled  with soda.  That would be awesome.  Would you get it?  Fuck yeah!  Fuck yeah!  Like the blind satchel.  I would say Rich Voss' version, the middle version.  What's up, Tim?  Tim, you're on After Open Anthony Live.  Hey, Sam.  So glad you were able to stick around.  See?  We the people are here to congratulate you and I know you're going to make somebody  a wonderful wife.  Yes, I will.  I will be a wonderful wife.  Thank you very much, Tim.  This is what I'm saying, Eric. 
[03:58:30]  These are my people.  Yes, I know.  These are the people.  These are the people.  But for one week, I think your wife and your family should take higher priority than these  people.  They got four days.  Four, and?  And the weekend.  And the weekend.  I'm putting on a best of Sam Roberts show on Sunday.  Instead of the live show.  As you should.  But that's, so that's five days of radio that I'm giving to lovely Miss Jess.  Yeah, if you don't come on Friday, your Sunday show will miss a guess or two. 
[03:59:00]  I'll be here on Friday, Roland.  I know you will.  You bet your bottom dollar I'll be here.  Yes, I booked you on Friday.  Nicole's pointing at me.  Come on in, Nicole.  What are you pointing at me through the window?  She was angry this morning, screaming down the hall.  She was.  Should I ask her about it?  Mm-hmm.  Nicole, what was going on this morning?  You were a little angry?  I was a little angry.  Why were you angry?  Nicole from the morning mashup, everybody.  Because Rich Davis, um...  He's your co-host on the show.  He's my co-host.  And he's a douchebag sometimes.  Why do you say that?  Because he doesn't, as long as it benefits him, he will, he will throw you under the bus 
[03:59:30]  or...  What did he throw you under the bus for?  He benefits, if he's benefiting on the air, if it makes a good topic, if it makes him sound  good on his other show, Covino & Rich, then he will, um, he will, he doesn't really care  if he gets you in trouble, if it makes you look bad.  So I was angry at him for saying something that I asked him not to say.  I asked him not to say somebody's name that I told him was talking crap about him.  Who was it?  I'm not gonna tell you.  Was it somebody who works here?  Yeah.  Was it Taylor?  No.  No, she was very angry screaming.  Was it a host?  No. 
[04:00:00]  Was it somebody that the audience would know?  No.  Was it Mikey Piff?  No.  He talks a lot of shit.  No, no, but...  He was talking shit about me and Carly Rae Jepsen.  He doesn't work with any of us in any capacity.  No.  But it just was like, now you brought me into something because you had to bring it on the  air.  Yeah.  No.  No.  So anyways, I was a little angry and I didn't mean to swear and hurt your ears.  Um...  You're one week away from your wedding.  I know, and you're...  I'm a day.  You're a day.  You're a week away.  I know.  Have your savings for cock gotten worse?  No.  They've actually subsided a bit.  Really? 
[04:00:30]  Yeah.  They've subsided.  I feel like...  I think...  Have you...  Is that because you've satisfied them with other...  With strange men?  No.  Okay.  I've just been...  I've been using what I got in front of me.  Mm-hmm.  And it's been working.  I think...  Is that you're talking about your fiancee?  My fiancee has been...  Okay.  He's been working out well for me, so...  Yeah.  You've been having a lot of sex with him?  Yeah.  A lot.  Good for you.  You took a couch recently and had to throw out your other one because there were jizz stains  all over it.  Well, it wasn't...  That wasn't the reason we threw it out, but...  Come to think of it, I mean, it was the right thing to do because I'd had that couch for, 
[04:01:00]  what, ten years and...  Mm-hmm.  How many sexual partners had you had on that couch?  Probably a good amount.  How many do you think?  I couldn't tell you if my life depended on...  I don't know, but I mean...  More than a dozen?  I don't wish to say.  If the couch could talk to you and go, fuck!  No, I just...  I just have had that...  I had that couch when I was in the prime of my single early twenties, right before I met Matt.  Right.  And...  And so you were...  I mean, you had a lot of partners at that point in your life.  I had a...  I had a...  I had a... 
[04:01:30]  I lived a bit.  So you were a little bit of a whore in your twenties?  I did, dude, and I have no qualms about it.  That's good.  I lived it up.  I have now...  See, now I don't have as much trouble getting married because...  Did you ever snowball with anybody?  I don't know what that means.  It's when you...  Well, Troy, do you want to explain it and get more familiar than I am?  Or do you want me to take it?  Go ahead.  Okay.  It's when you blow a guy, right?  Yeah.  And his semen's in your mouth?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  I've never done that before.  From your mouth to his mouth.  I've never done that before.  I've got way more respect for the men that I slept with to do such a thing.  What a square, huh, Troy? 
[04:02:00]  Prude.  What a prude.  Do you like that?  Do you like semen in your mouth, Troy?  No, I've had it done to me, but it's...  I didn't enjoy it.  But in Troy's instance...  Whatever.  It was the partner that he was with, which we're not going to mention by name because  we're classy here on After Open Anthony Live.  Can I mention her?  No, you shouldn't.  Out of respect for Troy Kwan.  But this person is a star of adult film, and it was worth doing.  I would have done it, too.  Just for the novelty of it?  No, just because it's hot.  Like, you made the right move.  It's not hot.  I don't know if I've put that on record. 
[04:02:30]  Like, I know when you first told me the story, I said, no way.  You made the right move.  Why is that hot?  Well, because of what the person was with.  And it was like, I've never done anything like that, and it was so taboo for me.  It was like, well, fuck it.  So then what do you do once it's in your mouth?  Swallow it.  You know, everybody has such a bunch of swallows.  You've probably, have you never fingered yourself and tasted your own pussy juice?  Nope, leave it.  Have you ever done that, Nicole?  Never, never, never, never, never, never.  Nicole, that's a lie.  Never my own.  Everybody's a bunch of fucking liars.  You tasted somebody else's, though.  Have you ever fingered a girl and licked your fingers?  Yeah, and I'm gonna leave now. 
[04:03:00]  Yeah, it's your box.  Why wouldn't you taste it?  I know, my God.  Listen.  Everybody, I'm glad you tuned in today.  Nicole has fingered a girl and tasted the girl's vaginal appreciation.  Everybody's a bunch of fucking liars.  They're a bunch of liars, aren't they?  I hate that shit.  I try to keep it real with you.  I try to keep it one hundo with you.  She said she did it on a beach, right?  Every girl tasted their own pussy juice.  You think so?  Yes!  Look, we gotta go.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  I appreciate all the well wishes and the nuptials from everybody.  It's very kind of you.  I like when I see a little bit of your souls out there. 
[04:03:30]  I want you to know you are my people.  And I will be back here for you on Friday.  Until then, you'll have to deal with those Opie and Anthony guys.  Maybe Jim Norton will be here, too.  Ron and Fez are on next.  Goodbye, everybody.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O&A show on Facebook at Facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.
