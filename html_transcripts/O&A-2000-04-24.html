<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a caller's explicit and graphic account of an unwanted sexual encounter with a bank teller in a bank vault.  The hosts then segued into a discussion of the Elian Gonzalez case, using crude and sexually suggestive language to describe Donato, Elian's cousin, and Janet Reno.  They extensively mocked their appearances and speculated about their motivations, focusing heavily on the infamous photo of the armed agent pointing a gun at Elian.  Numerous listener calls followed, contributing to the offensive and humorous commentary surrounding the Elian Gonzalez situation, with callers suggesting captions for the photo and participating in jokes about Janet Reno. A humorous rap song about Rudy Giuliani was also played. The segment concluded with a reference to a previous segment involving a woman covered in hot wax, with listeners encouraged to view pictures on the website.

The show continued with Opie's acne becoming a focal point, with humorous comparisons to various fictional characters and objects.  The hosts again referenced the hot wax incident involving a female guest, and proceeded to review the National Enquirer, mocking the appearances of aging celebrities like Bob Hope and Catherine Bach. The conversation returned to the Elian Gonzalez case, with more jokes about Janet Reno.  A listener then called in, expressing anger over the hosts' jokes about *Dukes of Hazzard*.  The news of James Doohan's late-in-life fatherhood prompted a discussion about the potential impact on the child.  The segment ended with a significant portion dedicated to a phone call from a superior reprimanding Opie and Anthony for repeatedly violating station policy, specifically mentioning their mockery of a sexual harassment training video and threatening termination. The hosts attempted humor during the reprimand, and there was discussion regarding the limits of on-air humor.

The next segment addressed the hosts' anxieties about corporate restrictions on their content, joking about the lack of acceptable targets for their satire due to corporate ownership.  A listener called claiming an impending FBI raid led to exaggerated scenarios of their arrest, including humorous requests for a Playboy model to replace a female guest. Anthony's laugh was repeatedly mocked.  A sponsored segment for the Vermont Teddy Bear Company followed, offering opportunities for more irreverent jokes and inappropriate commentary on the "sexual harassment video." A substantial portion was dedicated to a graphic and vulgar discussion of a segment from the Crocodile Hunter's show depicting his wife giving birth, with further offensive jokes and anecdotes about the Crocodile Hunter. The show concluded with a "What did we learn today?" segment, featuring listener calls filled with obscene and humorous takeaways from the broadcast, including jokes about bodily functions and obscure references to previous segments.  Celebrity promotional announcements, highlighting failures, and further jokes about upcoming ratings completed the broadcast.  Beyond the hosts, no other guests were explicitly mentioned as being in studio.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  OP and Advocate.  1027 WNEW.  Hi, what can I do for you?  Okay, is this Mr. William?  Yes.  Great, okay.  Basically, we're conducting a brief satisfaction survey for F*** Bank.  To do that, please indicate your level of satisfaction on a 1 to 7 scale,  where 7's the highest and 1's the lowest rating.  Um, 1.  Did you visit a teller on your most recent visit?  Yes, I did.  I'd like you to rate your teller visit at the branch  on three characteristics using a number from 1 to 7. 
[00:00:30]  Let's start with giving a personal touch to your transaction.  Uh, that would be a 7.  That was the problem.  There was too much touching going on.  Ah, I see.  Okay, how about the length of time you waited?  I didn't wait at all.  I guess he liked me.  Okay, 7 would be your highest level of satisfaction  and 1 would be your least.  Ah, well, the service was prompt,  but I didn't appreciate him hitting on me in the bank vault.  Ah, I see.  I think I got a sexual harassment suit pending myself.  Just so you know, there are comments later if you choose to add things. 
[00:01:00]  Oh, I got plenty of comments.  Okay, okay, good.  Yeah, he led me right into the big bank vault.  Okay.  How about your overall satisfaction with the teller service?  I didn't think he was going to try to make a deposit on me.  I'm sorry to hear that, sir.  You're still reading from your script,  and I'm trying to tell you that a guy at that branch  was hitting on me in the bank vault.  I assume you want to add comments,  those comments in later when I get to the comments section, ma'am?  You don't find this shocking that he bent me over in the bank vault? 
[00:01:30]  Well, I do, but unfortunately I'm not allowed,  I'm not supposed to offer any input one way or another.  His thingy looked like a roll of quarters.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry this happened, sir.  At any rate,  how would you like to rate your overall satisfaction with the teller service?  He was good, but I just don't go that way.  Okay.  The withdrawal process was a bitch.  Was a real problem, huh?  Did you talk to a manager?  You try pulling a roll of quarters out of your butt  and see what you would think.  Did you talk to a manager about it? 
[00:02:00]  Of course not.  I was horrified.  Okay.  Did you visit a sales or service representative  or branch manager at that point?  He said he would hurt my family if I told anyone.  Uh-huh.  He said it was going to be our little secret.  Yeah, little secret.  No, I got a big secret in the back of my pants.  Uh-huh.  Okay, sir.  Okay, did you visit a sales or service representative or branch manager?  Eight freaking inches.  Pardon me?  Go ahead.  Did you use an ATM at that branch in the last 30 to 45 days? 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, I had a PAM.  Okay, rate your overall satisfaction with the ATM service on a scale from one.  Oh, it was just dandy.  Just dandy?  Yes.  Okay.  You figure out the scale on just dandy.  That I can't do.  Um, I need an input from you.  I think I've heard enough about inputs.  Okay, do you want to rate it on the one to seven scale?  It was about eight inches.  I told you that earlier.  All things considered, thinking about your most recent visit to the branch,  rate your overall satisfaction with the service received at the branch  using a number from one to seven. 
[00:03:00]  Lady, it was a one.  He f***ed me in the b***h.  There are many service issues beyond your last branch visit  that affect your overall satisfaction.  Are you listening to me?  Do you understand what he did?  I understand what you're telling me, sir.  Have you ever been anally penetrating when you weren't expecting it?  Quite frankly, I don't think you are using the proper venue to express your frustration.  What do you want me to do?  You called him out of service.  I'm telling you what happened.  My butt wasn't a proper venue. 
[00:03:30]  Who are you kidding?  If you have comments later, I'll be more than happy to...  I need to comment now!  Okay.  I bent over, grabbed my ankles, he took this thing that looked like a roll of quarters  and he shoved it up my f***s!  The Opie and Anthony Show.  There's a good example of four programs.  One-oh-two-seven-W-N-E-W.  I want to welcome all of our affiliates back to the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:04:00]  Affiliates?  Just practicing, Anthony.  Yeah, for what?  It's the O and A Show.  Our phone line, 212-757-1027.  Write that down.  Call us whenever you feel like it.  We don't care.  Just try to have something good for the radio show, right?  Yes.  Right?  All right.  Well, let's talk about Ileon Gonzalez.  Ileon.  The taking of Ileon.  Do you know this is the second most talk-about news story? 
[00:04:30]  I heard it's number one now.  I heard it passed Lady Di.  No, that Lady Di isn't number one.  It passed Lady Di.  It passed JFK Jr., who was the second and third, respectively.  It is now in second place.  Wait, wait.  All right.  What is number one?  What is number one?  Huh.  It's something like 290 stories were dedicated to Lady Di.  Okay.  And I believe closer to 200 dedicated to... 
[00:05:00]  Oh, it's obvious.  It just hit me.  Okay.  Dedicated to JFK Jr.  Right.  Ileon is now pushing 300.  Uh-huh.  Um, and then the number one has, uh, up in the 520, uh, stories done on, on the subject.  OJ.  Yeah.  I forgot all about OJ.  That was the killer story of all time.  You're never topping the OJ thing.  That had to be the greatest story ever.  We're trying, though.  Up for the news.  We're trying, because this whole Ileon Gonzalez thing has all sorts of characters. 
[00:05:30]  You know how, like, OJ had the Judge Ito and the Cato?  Right, right.  Now we got the fisherman, uh, Al Cowling.  Yeah, Al Cowling.  Now we got the fisherman, uh, Donato, and we got the hot cousin, and...  Yeah, I like the uncle guy in the closet with the kid.  No, that's the fisherman.  Yeah, the fisherman.  That guy was great.  That's Donato.  That's the guy that pulled him out of the drink.  So, our commentary is going to be a lot different than any other station.  Let me tell you something about Donato.  So, he, uh, he rescues the kid five and a half months ago.  Yeah.  He wants to get into that cousin's pants. 
[00:06:00]  That's what he wants.  I think that's where his, uh, interests lie, more so than this little kid.  He's been hanging out in that house ever since he scooped up this kid,  not because he actually cares about the plight of the kid and the political, uh, ramifications.  I know.  He wants to get in that hot cousin's pants.  In the cousin's pants.  Flying up to Washington with her, going wherever she goes.  Yeah, they had pictures of them on the plane and getting off.  This is great, man.  Look, look at this.  I'm just some dopey fisherman.  I get hooked up with this, and I'm going to try to score with this broad. 
[00:06:30]  Uh, and man, does she have Hummer lips or what?  Yeah.  I want to see, uh...  Uh, Dan, what's going on?  Yeah, I was just wondering, too, if anybody else wanted to bang that Mary Sleeth's chick.  Who doesn't want to bang her?  She's like a CNN site.  Usually I can pop some pictures of her up.  They, they, CNN is like a porno site now.  Every picture is of her.  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, she, there's something about her. 
[00:07:00]  She's sitting there talking.  I mean, first of all, she's a good-speaking Cuban, which is, you know, something to be said.  She's going to Washington, and she's all hot and stuff.  She's all hot and stuff.  She really is really hot, so.  All right, Dan.  Thank you.  Bye.  So, uh, I guess we've got to talk about the, uh...  Well, uh, Janet Reno sent in some, uh, INS guys and some...  She is just not human, first of all.  Human.  The lady is not human, man. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, she's, she's like out of control.  You see her at the press conference, first of all.  Did anyone else notice that right side of her body shaking like a, uh, a bad car on...  No, a car on bad gas.  As Jay Moore would say, a car on bad gas.  Yeah.  She's in bad shape.  So where do we begin, Anthony?  Where do we begin?  We've all seen the footage and the picture, and...  Well, they asked for the kid, obviously, to be handed over.  Uh, they didn't hand him over.  They were making all kinds of plans on how they were going to encircle the house. 
[00:08:00]  Mm-hmm.  Uh, to keep, uh, Ely on, uh, with them.  How lazy are these damn Cubans down there in Little Havana?  Well, I guess the, uh, INS people knew that because they struck in the middle of the night and they're all asleep.  They're either really lazy or really stupid because, uh, during the day,  there's, what, a thousand, uh, uh, supporters outside the house, right?  Yeah, like they're just going to come barging in for the kid during the day.  Right.  Yeah, like the, like the INS is going to have a little lunch at McDonald's and then, you know,  12 noon, come walking down the street and get the kid.  Yeah.  They're not stupid, first of all.  No, they always do. 
[00:08:30]  They have all these leaders and stuff.  During the day, they were making human chains around the whole house, Anthony.  Yeah.  Like, uh, they'd have a code word and within two minutes they had a complete human chain around the entire house.  Uh-huh.  Where it would be pretty tough to, to get through this damn chain, okay?  There could be some problems.  So, obviously, they're not going to come during the day.  They, they, they chose, what, 5 a.m. or something ridiculous like that?  3 a.m.?  3 in the morning when everybody was asleep.  When everyone was asleep and at home and there were like 50, you know, people outside the house.  Yeah.  How stupid are you? 
[00:09:00]  Of course they're going to come at night.  They should have had some kind of plan where they, you know, had a bunch of people staying a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday night and, you know.  Well, that would take some form of organization.  Right.  Please, don't get silly now.  Because everyone was shocked.  They, they wake up and like, what, they came and took the kid in the middle of the night?  Yeah, of course.  What'd you think they were going to do?  The, uh, the picture I love.  The guy with the gun with the grenade launcher on it.  I mean, you see that thing?  He's got like the M-16 with the grenade launcher on the bottom. 
[00:09:30]  And, um, and Jack's pointing it at the kid's face.  And Janet Reno, that piece of crap, trying to say, like, but if you look closely at the picture, you know, his, his finger's not on the trigger.  His finger's not on the trigger.  Oh, your gun, you're going to freak out.  I don't care that the, the, the finger wasn't on the trigger.  It looked like some kind of bizarre scene out of Half-Life.  Yeah.  Out of one of my computer games or something.  Do you think that the guy with the gun that was pointed at Elion and, and Donato, uh, goes home after, like, the seizure and hugs his kids and has a nice Easter dinner? 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  Oh, he must have.  Is he able to sleep after that?  Oh, he didn't shoot him.  He was just pointing the gun at the, uh, at the kid and the, the, the, the other guy.  I'm absolutely amazed there were no shots fired in that house.  I'm just so glad that AP photographer was in, in the house, though, because, I mean, you, this stuff happens all the time.  We think this stuff only happens in other countries.  No, it happens in the U.S. of A.  And we finally have documentation. 
[00:10:30]  We're bastards, too.  You know, it was, uh, great in that picture, though.  The, the, the, the idea that the guy didn't smash the photographer in the face with the butt of the rifle.  Yeah.  I mean, you see a camera go off.  Oh.  Spin around and whack him in the face.  And, and take the camera.  Take the camera.  No pictures.  I, Clinton.  Back at, well, he's in New York today.  He must be just so freaking pissed.  What?  That, that, that the, that the picture got out.  You don't let a picture like that get out. 
[00:11:00]  Whether you agree or disagree with what happened, you don't, I don't care.  You don't allow a picture like that.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I'm out in a few months.  I can't run again, so I don't care.  It's all in Gore's lap now.  Screw him.  I'm getting some gag.  But you don't let a picture like that get out.  Oh.  Don't care.  Don't matter to me.  What do I care for?  Anyone else notice?  I just want that hot cousin.  Come on, baby.  Where are you?  I got a little on here in my pants. 
[00:11:30]  Well, she wants to go, uh, she wants a, uh, a face-to-face meeting with Jennerino and the president.  About a face-to-crotch meeting.  Right, exactly.  Where's the president?  How about that one?  Better put a few more pounds on before you go see the president.  Well, I'm a seagull.  Right.  Ruben.  Oh, that was the best sign.  What the hell was it outside the house?  Uh, Clinton loves our cigars but doesn't love our people.  Something like that.  Some of the signs were hilarious.  Uh, any OK Terrific?  No, I was looking for the OK Terrific sign. 
[00:12:00]  That's why we have to be syndicated, so no matter where news breaks, there will be a ridiculous wow sign or an OK Terrific sign.  There was an OK Moody blend.  Yeah.  OK Moody blend.  And then the footage of them running out of the house.  Did anyone else notice that dyke lady that they, you know, they wanted a woman to carry Elyon out of the house?  Yeah, yeah.  They picked the most butchy woman, you know, they could, I guess.  Or maybe that's the most womanly woman they have in the INS.  And then, um...  And she runs into... 
[00:12:30]  Did anyone else see when she ran out the front door, she ran right into a bush?  Was I the only one that picked up on that?  She runs into a bush and they had to pull her out so she could continue running toward the suburban?  That was my excuse.  I just ran into that bush.  What happened?  And the best thing, Elyon just hysterical crying as they're dragging him out of the house.  Yeah.  A few hours later, there's nice pictures of him smiling and having fun with his father.  I think Clinton personally took those pictures.  Smile, you little bastard.  I think Clinton got to that Air Force base and had his little camera around and made sure that he got some good shots from the media as soon as possible. 
[00:13:00]  You're going to smile, you little son of a bitch.  Just hit him in the midsection with a phone book so the bruises don't show.  There you go.  Cry once on camera, I swear to God, I will shoot you.  Remember that big scary man with the gun and the helmet?  He will shoot you when you sleep.  He will smile and play with the toys that we gave you with your father. 
[00:13:30]  What's your cousin's number?  I want to know who's paying for this family to fly to Washington.  Yesterday, they're shopping all day.  They're staying at hotel rooms.  They've got the best lawyers.  Now, this is interesting.  The father and Elian now together.  Where are they?  Washington?  The Air Force base.  Any time frame on when they're going back to Cuba?  Months.  Months.  Months.  Why? 
[00:14:00]  Because I don't know.  I guess he just gets custody, but they're still going to have some kind of a court battle over this.  Yeah.  So they just took him so they can enforce this custody thing.  Right.  While the thing is pending.  Okay.  Because I have a little scenario.  Yeah.  I think I see what's going to happen here.  I see why they wanted to get the kid with the father as quickly as possible.  Now, the father and son, very happy in the U.S. of A.  Stay.  Money pouring in.  Stay.  They're going to take care of him.  Best hotels. 
[00:14:30]  You think this guy is going to want to go back to Cuba?  No.  Because politically, I mean, Clinton looks like a hero if the father stays in the country now.  With the kid.  Yeah.  But you know what, though?  Did you see the conspiracy theories in the post today?  Oh, no.  What's that?  The conspiracy theories are, like, going crazy already.  A lot of people are saying, Anthony, that that baby that came over with the father and the new wife is, wait a minute, is Fox Mulder's missing sister? 
[00:15:00]  It's not their baby, and the real baby's back in Cuba.  And that's why the guy is definitely going back home.  Oh, that's it.  So it's like a fake baby.  The real baby's back in Cuba, and he gets the real baby back when he goes back to Cuba.  When he goes back.  So there's some, yeah, because I don't think Castro would have let him come here without having some kind of guarantee that he's coming back.  There's some great conspiracy theories in the post.  But it seems to me like a lot of Cubans that are here really didn't give a flying F about any family back there, because they stayed. 
[00:15:30]  Right.  And their whole family didn't make it over, so.  There's another theory that, a conspiracy theory, that if this doesn't work out, like Fidel Castro threatened Clinton to get the kid back.  Yeah.  That Castro was just going to send a ton of RAF people heading toward the United States.  That's like his Navy.  It's just refugees.  It's funny, because supposedly Castro has done this in the past.  Yeah.  When he wants to get the United States back, he sends a lot of people toward the United States. 
[00:16:00]  On inner tubes.  On inner tubes.  Fences and stuff.  Not just a few.  He sends hundreds upon hundreds.  Yeah.  Which is just a nightmare for our government.  Yeah, they did that a few years back.  Is this guy dropping dead anytime soon?  He looked pretty good on TV the other day.  I'm so tired of this guy.  He's the last real communist stronghold around here.  He doesn't even really have that much power anymore, except in his own little island. 
[00:16:30]  We're just waiting for him to drop.  Oh, the casinos.  Come on.  Then democracy is just going to run rampant in that damn island.  Cuban people.  Oh, you would have the casinos, the beachfront hotels, all kinds of revenue from tourism.  That place would be unbelievable in a few years.  Right.  There's the picture on the computer.  Just think what your dream would be like, Cuban people, if you hear me over there in Cuba right now from one of our affiliates. 
[00:17:00]  If all the hotels and casinos, think of your dream come true.  Here would be you.  Housekeeping.  Housekeeping.  Housekeeping.  When you check out.  This could be you.  All right, and obviously a ton of people have comments about it on the phone lines.  Don't get too serious, because we have no desire to get too serious with this whole thing.  No.  Every other damn TV station and talk show is talking about the political crap. 
[00:17:30]  Ilyon.  This is just going to end up one of those things where years from now they're going to say, whatever happened to Ilyon?  And you'll just see this big, fat, bloated Cuban guy.  I was Ilyon.  Wait.  Remember how cute I was?  Here's the picture of me and my hot cousin.  The cousin will be all fat and dumpy, mustache.  Yes, I cared for him.  Oh, that night when they came to get him, it was terrible.  No one will care anymore.  No. 
[00:18:00]  But now, you know, it's a big story.  Oh, look at that shot of the cousin.  Where?  Let me see.  A little halter top.  Someone sent it on instant feedback.  All right, hold the phone.  Look at those lips.  Got to punch that one up.  Whoever sent those on the instant feedback, you rule a whole bunch of pictures of the hot cousin.  What, he sent a link?  Uh, yeah.  Oh, wait.  Oh, I like the red top.  No, no, keep going.  Screw the first shot.  Let's get through all the shots.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  We got that one.  He needs a boob job, though, I think. 
[00:18:30]  Why?  What are they looking like?  They're nice, but, you know.  Oh, wow.  She's making a dopey face there.  Yeah, man.  She's...  The first picture's the first one.  The first one?  The second to last was really good, too.  Very nice.  Someone send that link to Steve.  Why do you think she needs a boob job?  From the unofficial website.  A boob job for size or for firmness?  No, I don't know.  Just to make the fantasy complete, I guess.  Oh, is that...  Oh, wait.  Okay, I'm getting the picture by the red car there?  Yeah.  Hey, that's a good one. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, come on, baby.  Goddamn.  I will do anything in my power to get my swing.  All right.  I mean, to get...  And we'll go to the phones next.  We'll spend one more break on Ileon, and then we'll move on, okay?  Right.  A lot of people have comments.  Phone line 212-757-1027.  This is a favorite from the ONA archives.  It's Anthony and his old band with Joe and Foot and Rex and Fred, I believe.  Right?  Yeah. 
[00:19:30]  You know the song.  You'll love it.  Here it is.  We'll be back.  Drown, drown, cubans, drown.  Drown, cubans, drown.  Yeah, cubans, drown.  Drown, down, down, cubans, drown.  Turn around.  Oh, we hope you won't drown.  You're on your way.  Come to the USA.  Drown, down, down, down, knock it down.  Let's hear it for the refugees.  Give them a hand.  For the days just to open up a taco stand. 
[00:20:00]  20 cubans float on a wine bottle of cork.  Guantanamo Bay is just a five-minute walk.  Turn around.  Drown, down, down, down, down, down.  We hope you won't drown.  Drown, down, down, down, down, down, down.  Cubans, let's get a shame.  Drown, down, down, down, down, down, down, down.  Drown, down, down, down, down, down, down.  Drown, down, down, down, down, down, down, down.  Because all your relatives stay away.  Remember Ricky Ricardo, Babalu, I.A.  Look at Mama Sita, she's as big as a boat. 
[00:20:30]  You'd shove a motor up a raft if you thought she'd float.  Turn around.  Oh, we hope you won't drown.  You're on your way.  USA, down, down, down, down, down, down, down.  Oh, we hope you won't drown.  Oh, we hope you won't drown.  Oh, we hope you won't drown.  Oh, we hope you won't drown.  Oh, we hope you won't drown.  Oh, we hope you won't drown.  Oh, we hope you won't drown.  Oh, we hope you won't drown.  Oh, we hope you won't drown.  Oh, we hope you won't drown.  Oh, we hope you won't drown.  Oh, we hope you won't drown.  Oh, we hope you won't drown. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, we hope you won't drown.  Oh, we hope you won't drown.  Oh, we hope you won't drown.  Oh, we hope you won't drown.  Oh, we hope you won't drown.  Oh, we hope you won't drown.  Oh, we hope you won't drown.  How you doing? This is Andrew Dice Clay.  And you're listening to, no, not Anthony Dice Clay, Andrew Dice, and you're listening to Hopi and the guy that wants to be me show on WNEW 102.7.  And our phone number, 212-757-1027, spending a little time with the Elion Gonzalez thing, taking a little different angle than everyone else. 
[00:21:30]  I'm trying to get Louis Black on the air today, Anthony.  Oh, yeah, I'm sure he's got plenty to say about it.  From Comedy Central, we're having a hard time hunting him down. 
[00:22:00]  I think he just filled with comments about the Elion Gonzalez stuff on the weekend.  I wouldn't doubt it, knowing him.  What do you got over there, Anthony?  Well, I'm just lapping along, looking at the Elion Gonzalez picture of that Donato guy holding him with the same green shirt on.  Yeah.  The guy's been wearing that green shirt for two weeks.  You must smell.  And what were they, hiding in the closet?  Yeah.  Because then the guy, oh, my God, this guy is now famous. 
[00:22:30]  Like, in a second, you're famous.  He's got his little helmet on, his little goggle.  Looks like he's going out to play paintball.  And he's pointing the gun right at him.  And he looks like he's grabbing for Elion's throat.  That's going to be one of those pictures that's going to be as famous as, like, the Vietnamese kids running down the street naked.  Naked?  After the napalm attack?  Yeah.  Yeah, that one.  Or the guy getting his brains blown out in Vietnam? 
[00:23:00]  Mm-hmm.  By the other guy?  Right.  Yeah.  The Viet Cong guy?  Yeah.  Wasn't that a good one?  Ah, the videotape of that is even better.  People Magazine has an article about Vietnam.  I mean, an article, a whole issue pretty much dedicated to going back to Vietnam.  Yeah.  And they have a lot of those pictures that they took, and then they, you know, they have the update of what they're doing now and stuff.  Yeah, that guy lives in the United States, the guy that shot him.  Yeah.  He's like a cop or something.  Right.  The video's great, though.  He puts it to the head.  The guy's just like, oh, no. 
[00:23:30]  Some of the little kids that were running down the street naked, they still live on that exact street.  Really?  Yeah, it's an interesting article issue, I should say.  But in about ten years, People Magazine will, you know, do a where are they now with this picture that we all saw.  Memorable photos from the thousands.  From the OOs.  From the OOs.  Gileon.  You know, we should put a caption of this. 
[00:24:00]  A caption on the picture?  Yeah.  We should have a little caption contest.  Taco Bell should use it.  Drop the chalupa.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  They probably could have just put any Cuban kid in the closet, in the closet with that guy.  Mm-hmm.  And hide Eileon under the bed and then just have the agents take the fake kid, the wrong kid. 
[00:24:30]  And by the time they realize their mistake, they could have Eileon somewhere else.  Yeah.  They weren't really thinking.  Not that organized.  Not that organized.  We went over that already today.  If they were organized, they would have overthrown Castro instead of sailing over here on a piece of lumber.  Well, let's go to the phones.  Everyone has comments today.  Jamal, what's up?  What's up, guys?  How are you?  All right.  I was listening to the chick this morning and I'm listening to you guys now.  Am I the only one who didn't notice these people are, like, throwing lawn chairs at the cars and crap like that?  Oh, when they got the kid out of the house? 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They can barely afford chairs and they're, like, throwing them at them.  Oh, they're very passionate.  Yeah.  They're probably throwing garbanzo beans at them, too.  I don't understand the protesters outside the Lincoln Tunnel over the way.  Oh, my God.  Well, there's a 10-year-old kid out there laying on the ground.  Yeah, laying in front of buses.  If you're protesting something that's going on in Miami, why the hell are you blocking the Lincoln Tunnel?  There's a great way to get support for your cause by effing up traffic for people. 
[00:25:30]  That just makes us more pissed off.  Like, I'm going to go, oh, thank you for stopping traffic.  Now I'm late for where I have to go.  I'm really behind you now.  But you know what?  Yeah, I'm very sympathetic toward your cause.  Thank you.  Thank you for making me an hour and a half late for my Easter dinner.  Thank you.  Throwing out racial epithets of the people out of my window.  All right, Jamal.  All right.  Thank you.  It doesn't really help when you take your protest somewhere far away.  You want to protest?  Get on a plane, fly down there, and protest.  Get your cute little sign and hang out with everyone else. 
[00:26:00]  I love people that protest.  Like when something happens in Indonesia and you get the Indonesians over here protesting in New York.  What the hell is that going to do?  We're not doing it.  We're not over there.  Yeah, it wasn't our deal.  Oh.  Where's Hillary?  Why hasn't she made any comments yet?  Oh, she's afraid to open her mouth.  They haven't told her what to say yet, obviously.  They haven't told her what her position is on it yet.  You know, love them or hate them, at least the mayor just always speaks his mind immediately.  What is he saying about this whole thing? 
[00:26:30]  He's pretty much outraged.  I'm outraged.  I'm not saying I agree with him, but I appreciate the fact that he'll just at least give you a comment right away and speak his mind.  He should be outraged at his wife, Giuliani.  The vagina monologues.  What's that?  That play that she's in now?  Yeah, she's doing the vagina monologues.  The vagina monologues.  Where women get up on the stage and talk about their vagina.  Yeah.  And this is the wife of a man that closed down an exhibit at a museum because he dubbed it a little pornographic or sexual or too touchy or disgrace. 
[00:27:00]  Right.  You know, he puts his ideology on things, but he can't even keep his old lady in check.  You know she's doing it on purpose.  You know she's caught.  They cannot friggin' stand each other.  You know, he hasn't had a monologue with that vagina in quite a while.  Right?  Absolutely not.  Allegedly.  Allegedly. 
[00:27:30]  From what I can see on the outside, basing my own judgment here on things I've seen in the past, I don't think they get along very well, Opie.  I think he's sticking out this marriage thing.  What makes you say that?  I think it's a perfect relationship.  You don't have to see the other person.  I just don't think he wants the big divorce on his record there when he's running for the Senate or any other future political aspirations that he has.  So they just go their separate ways, but they're technically still married.  You'd think if she came to him, 
[00:28:00]  Um, hon, I'm going to do a play.  Oh, that's great.  That's great, sweetie.  Very good that you're getting back into this whole thing.  You've got the Channel 5 news thing that you do every morning so well, dear.  You look wonderful.  On good day, New York.  So what's this play you're doing, dear?  Oh, um, the vagina monologue.  The vagina monologue.  Well, that sounds fascinating. 
[00:28:30]  What's it about?  Vaginas.  See, it's a bunch of ladies, and we get on stage and talk about vaginas.  Talk about vaginas.  That's wonderful.  You have my blessings, dear.  Feel free.  Do that.  I don't think that it went that way.  No, I don't think so.  I think it's like, yeah, I'm going to do this, and it's just going to dig into him.  Well, it's interesting, you know, who was putting on that play, too. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, yeah, a Hillary supporter.  Yeah, the woman that wrote this play is the one that headed up her expeditionary, expeditionary commission, whatever it was.  Whatever it was.  Exploratory committee.  Right.  To see if she should run.  To see what the polls were saying.  And now, you know, it just totally goes against everything Rudy would like for his wife to be doing.  He'd like the wife to be right by his side every time he gives a speech.  And she's never there.  Never.  So now she's doing the vagina monologue. 
[00:29:30]  That's wonderful.  We've been back in New York for two years now.  I don't remember ever seeing them together.  Yeah.  But I'm just speaking for the last two years.  I haven't seen one picture with them together.  I'm going to be in a play of the penis story.  It's going to be great.  We all, a bunch of guys get together and talk about our swings.  Swings.  The vagina monologues.  Hi, I'm Donna Hanover's vagina. 
[00:30:00]  Who is this Rudy guy?  Don't think we've met.  Dude, not to interrupt you, but people are starting to, like, you know, fax in their own captions for the picture.  Good.  Look at this one.  They show Ileon with a water pistol aimed at the stormtrooper's head.  Look at that.  That's cool.  That's classic.  Yeah, feel free to superimpose anything else you might want to.  Goddamn, that's funny.  One guy sent in a picture where.  Ileon resists, it says.  He's got a little water pistol. 
[00:30:30]  Look at that.  One guy sent in a picture where you're, like, the stormtrooper guy, Anthony.  Oh, really?  Your face is superimposed.  And I'm Donato holding Ileon.  Yeah, that's even better than a caption.  Just use some of your little computer software and do this picture up.  This looks funny.  Yeah.  He's pointing it right at his head.  It looks like he's smiling at him.  The best doctoring of a photo I ever saw was Oswald being shot of Jack Ruby. 
[00:31:00]  And they superimposed instruments in everybody's hands.  And it looks like they're a band.  Yeah.  And Oswald is screaming because he got shot.  It's like a punk band.  He looks like he's.  Yeah.  And they have a microphone in his hand.  It looks like he's screaming.  Doing like a punk scream or something.  And the cop that's rushing to Ruby to get the gun, his hands are out.  They put a keyboard under his hand.  So it looks like he's playing keyboard.  Another cop's got a guitar in his hand.  And all their faces look like they're just rocking.  It's the funniest friggin' thing.  I need that on a shirt. 
[00:31:30]  I've seen those on shirts.  That picture on a shirt.  Yeah.  Feel free to doctor up the Ileon picture.  I would love to see what some of you sick Fs have in your head.  Let's go to Roger.  Roger, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  What's up, man?  I got a caption for you, Ileon.  Yeah.  What's up?  Jesus.  What's up?  What's up?  It's more like, K-Vaza.  Okay, guys.  Have a good day.  Go, Knicks.  Go.  All right.  Yeah, go, Knicks. 
[00:32:00]  Go.  That's right.  Let's go to Rich here.  Rich, what's up?  What's up, R&A?  How are you?  I was scanning through the cable yesterday, and I saw the cousin on T-Spin.  Yeah.  And she was doing the fakest cry you'll ever see in your life.  And out of nowhere, she goes to the serious face, holding up the picture of the SWAT guy  with the gun.  Yeah.  Superimposed.  It looked like a family portrait type picture.  And just kept throwing it up.  Federal child abuse.  Yeah, I know.  We all seen that.  Yeah, she's just crying in serious face.  She could have got an Academy Award for that.  I couldn't concentrate on what she was saying, because I was looking at those Hummer lips 
[00:32:30]  of her.  Yeah.  I like the fall one.  Those are, those are the, wow.  Those lips just, these, these lips, oh?  Ah!  Just showed me a picture of Janet Reno.  You ass.  Oh, that's Janet Reno?  You know, I always thought it was Johnny Reno.  Wow.  You know, I think.  That's a chick?  I think if you do Janet Reno, you're officially gay.  Yeah.  I really think you're officially gay if you, uh, if you do that mess. 
[00:33:00]  She's looking hot, though.  Oh, my God.  They try to dolly her up, man.  There's not enough spackle in the world.  She's wearing lipstick.  That's what I mean.  Lipstick on her.  They dolly her up.  What's that all about?  They made her wash her hair before that press conference, finally.  Yeah.  Yeah, she has the greasiest head of hair.  Oh, my God.  Yeesh.  When was the last time anyone had a monologue with that vagina?  A vagina monologue starring Janet Reno. 
[00:33:30]  Yes.  Yeah.  In a stunning twist, Janet Reno is, is, I don't know, a vagina monologue.  Let's hear her vagina's monologue.  Fascinating.  Wait, I'm trying to get some people in.  He's got to be so pissed.  There it is.  Hello?  Janet, anyone home? 
[00:34:00]  Oh, my God.  It's very dusty in here.  Wow, this thing is sealed up tight, isn't it?  A lot of cobwebs.  I'm trying to get through again.  There's no getting through this.  It's barren and dry.  Boy, this thing is sealed up tight.  I don't think that's going to work. 
[00:34:30]  Fire in the hole!  I don't think anything's been in here for years.  There's a vagina monologue.  There's not enough KY in the world to get that going.  All right.  Well, Anthony, we're having a lot of fun today, aren't we?  Oh, yeah.  Give Raph Boy to Dr. Smith.  All right.  Yeah.  Keep line one on hold. 
[00:35:00]  We'll go to him next.  You should put Dr. Smith's face in that guy that's got the gun.  Oh, that's good.  Give me the boy.  Give me the boy.  Give me the boy.  Woo!  Unhand him.  Give him to me.  Put his hand in the last.  Woo!  Yeah, put the robot's head on the stormtrooper.  Oh, dear.  And put Dr. Smith's head on Donato, and that would be a very funny picture.  Get away from him, you metallic crustacean.  Oh, more captions coming in for the picture, Anthony.  Yeah? 
[00:35:30]  Paul E. from New York writes,  Give me the boy, or I'll hit you with a Yule log.  I wonder who's face he put on that.  Come on!  All right.  We have to take a break.  We're going to try to replay the audio from Friday.  A lot of people missed a great segment, because it was Good Friday, and a lot of people had off.  We had a very, very hot lady in here.  Jill was her name, and we poured hot wax all over her body.  There's some great pictures on the unofficial Opie and Anthony website, foundrymusic.com.  And if you did hear the segment, it would be kind of cool to interact with the pictures while we replay it. 
[00:36:00]  Right.  Right?  Mm-hmm.  Wouldn't be a bad idea.  We're going to try to get that on soon, but there's still some great phone calls about the whole  Elion Gonzalez thing, the Janarino thing.  Elion.  Giuliani.  You want to play this real fast?  How's your vagina?  All right.  Let's play the Rudy rap as we go to breaks.  We'll be back.  Yeah, you taste that, Biotch.  Boom.  Let me taste it.  I'm a bad mother f***er. 
[00:36:30]  Lord Cuomo.  Let me taste it.  What a thing.  It's twice as easy.  That's right.  I'm Rudy G, I'm here to say.  My hair looks like a roadkill toupee.  I'm the number one man in NYC.  So why are all the homo so pissed at me?  I'm the R to the U to the D to the Y.  A bad mother f***er makes a food vendor cry.  Mm-hmm.  Get the cars off the streets, you goddamn immigrants.  That's right.  That's right. 
[00:37:00]  I'm a bad mother f***er.  Close the strip clubs and porno stores.  I don't care.  The cops bring my horse.  Take on Al and Farrakhan.  I'm plenty f***ing tough for a skinny white man.  So squeegee guy trying to turn a buck.  Get yourself a job, you lazy f***.  Yeah.  I'm the mayor, man.  I'm number one.  I got a frigid wife and a big fat son.  But give me no s*** about Hillary.  That fat ass b***h ain't no better than me.  I can't bother with the homeless and sick. 
[00:37:30]  All the motherf***ers can suck my d***.  I'm Rudy G.  Yeah, I'm Rudy G, motherf***er.  The Lispin' Mayor, Rudy G.  Lord Comeover to the motherf***ers in my house.  Word.  Dudes with dudes.  I think every time we open our mouths, we're pissing someone off.  Opie and Anthony.  Get in there.  Get in there.  We're out of control. 
[00:38:00]  We're so lazy.  All right.  Knock it off.  1027 WNEW.  It's the ONA Show.  212-757-1027.  Talking about Ileon Gonzalez for a little while longer.  And then we're going to replay the hot wax chick from Friday.  Amazing radio.  We found a new concept.  We invite girls to come down here and get naked in week four.  A candle wax all over.  It's very hot.  We're talking about Janet Reno, too. 
[00:38:30]  Janet Reno.  We were talking about, imagine having sex with Janet Reno during the commercial job.  Yeah, that was a quick conversation.  That was a very quick conversation.  Okay, imagine it.  No.  Thank you.  There's an instant feedback came in.  Some guy was watching the news.  The assistant attorney general said that he had to hold a crying Janet Reno after she gave the word to grab Ileon.  Yeah, right.  Holding Janet Reno.  A crying.  Imagine that.  The big, gorky, manly Janet Reno. 
[00:39:00]  You have to hold.  I can't believe I had to give the order.  You're like running your hand through a greasy hair.  There, there, Janet.  Oh my God, this is disgusting.  You're holding.  You're holding your hands and you're shaking along with her.  That would be a hell of a hand job, though. 
[00:39:30]  Imagine that surreal moment.  Janet, could you just put that arm down my pants?  I have to give the order.  It's so tough doing me.  Having sex with her is like having sex with a jackhammer.  You just jump right aboard. 
[00:40:00]  Janet, I was thinking maybe if you and I got together, we could have a lemon.  That's a good one, too.  There I am.  Always late.  You can play.  Yeah, that's one sound you'll never hear with Janet Reno.  Dave on line, too, has a good idea.  You can play orgasm or tremor with Janet Reno. 
[00:40:30]  You're having sex with her and you have to try to figure out if that's an orgasm or a tremor.  That's funny.  We've got to get Dave on the line.  It's his joke.  Dave, that's funny, man.  I thought you were going to take my light there.  You know what I'm saying?  No, we try to give you guys credit as much as we can.  I appreciate it.  That's very funny.  My other question for you is with this Elion thing.  What was that putz wearing the freaking ski cap for?  Yeah, really? 
[00:41:00]  Because he doesn't want to be recognized because in his community, he's the idiot.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  And you know what INS stands for, for that dyke who took him out?  I need a shower.  She was a mess.  Yeah.  Oh, what a butch.  But listen, you guys rock.  All right, Dave, thank you.  Let's go to Rob, who had that Raph Boy, Dr. Smith thing.  Rob, what's up?  What's up, brothers?  How are you?  I just think this could have been settled a long time ago if we gave the kid to Dr. Smith.  Yeah.  Just throw him that way, you know? 
[00:41:30]  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  I would take care of the young boy, wouldn't I?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Young, hairless boy.  Woo!  As far as Janet Reno goes, you know.  Wow.  All right, Rob.  And A.O.P.  Yeah.  Thanks for showing the world you love rock and roll, man.  Easy.  Show the world you love rock and roll.  Ah, Vinny from the Bronx.  I heard Janet Reno won't be able to hold Elyon due to the shaking baby syndrome.  A lot of people coming up with captions for the famous picture of the gunman and Elyon 
[00:42:00]  in the hands of Donato, the fisherman.  Yeah.  Keep them coming in.  You're making us laugh.  Steve C. from foundrymusic.com.  Ah, getting into the scene.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  That's the unofficial Opie and Anthony website.  He's got the pictures of Elyon's aunt up on the website, so you could check out what we  were checking out.  Someone came up with all the pictures of her. 
[00:42:30]  That was very nice.  Thank you.  I cropped out everything except her.  Hopefully that'll speed up viewing.  Jerry thinks Reno is a great American.  Jerry, what's up?  I think she's all right.  I think you guys are terrible for busting on her.  She's a great American.  Oh, come on, man.  Now, Lily.  I'm actually...  We must get Elyon, Lily.  No, I actually...  Grandpa!  Grandpa!  Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  I have...  I'm an independent filmmaker. 
[00:43:00]  I have plans when she leaves the office, making her an offer to do a porno with that  guy that was flopping around during the Oscars.  The Gim.  Yeah, I'm going to put them both together in a porno flick.  God, I would rent that.  I would rent that, too.  Okay, then.  Do you guys want to be in it also?  Yeah, sure.  Do you guys want to finance my next play?  It's going to be called The Penis Monologues.  Okay, terrific.  Thank you, Jerry.  All right.  One joke, too many.  Jerry did just fine.  Al, what's up?  Hey, Anthony, you guys suck. 
[00:43:30]  All right, Al.  How are you doing?  Good.  I heard on the news that the FBI wanted to see if there were any guns in the Elyon's house,  so they positioned a satellite.  They didn't do it for that.  They did it so Clinton could get his rocks off watching the cousin take a shower.  Put a camera in her shower.  Move it faster.  Get it in faster.  I'm almost up.  You're a bitch, you little whore.  Yeah, I'm going to bang you.  Ed, I'll get you a green card, you whore. 
[00:44:00]  Ed, what's up?  Say okay.  Look, someone like Panarino, you know, a manly person like she is with a big set of balls to do with, you know, what happened.  She sure does have a set.  But she's, you know, she's the size of, you know, like Andre the Giant, it looks like.  Well, you know, no one died in this one, so one for three.  Not bad.  They did the right thing.  One for three.  All right, Ed, thank you.  All right. 
[00:44:30]  Let's go to Vinny.  Oh, boy.  Vinny.  Oh, and hey.  Vinny the racist.  Vinny the racist.  How you doing, man?  Yeah, I don't like that.  I don't like the name racist.  But anyway, fellas.  When you call other shows, you're just Vinny, right?  Yeah, well, I've got to say Vinny the racist so they know who I am.  Are they paying you at any W yet?  I hear you on every other radio show.  Stop cutting it out.  You do not.  But that's all.  They want to say this, though.  You know, these Cubans are so courageous.  You know, they're forming a human change. 
[00:45:00]  They're laying in front of the Lincoln Tull.  How come they weren't doing this over in Cuba?  Now they've got all this courage.  These people get me sick to my stomach.  They're sickening.  I'm tired of it.  What you're saying is they should have shown some courage against their own government,  against Castro.  Well, they know they can come over here, Anthony, and do whatever the hell they want  because they know they're not going to get shot.  But they're so brave.  But they didn't have any bravery when they were over in that Cuba country.  They come here, they're very brave. 
[00:45:30]  I give them a lot of credit.  You know?  Well, you know, I actually have to agree with Vinny the Racist on this one.  Thank you.  Anthony, thank you.  You know, we are worlds apart sometimes, Vinny the Racist.  But on this one, I have to agree with you.  Anthony, that's because you're Italian, brother, and you know what's going on.  You know, and I'm watching this pro, this Marciales, Gonzalez, whatever, on TV.  She's looking for the cameras.  She wants to make sure before she cries that there's a camera on her.  All these people are scum. 
[00:46:00]  And I'm just fed up with it.  And I'm just so happy that this guy finally has got his son back.  And finally the United States had a little guillardies to go in there and do the right thing.  It took him long enough.  All right, Vinny.  All right, I'm sorry.  No, I'm sorry.  Thank you.  I love you guys.  All right, Vinny.  You love me.  We like you.  How's that?  You love me.  All right.  So long, LP.  Bye. 
[00:46:30]  Another caption for the Ileon picture coming in.  Hi, my name is Spaz.  Can we be friends?  Maybe go for a beer or something.  Keep the captions coming in.  I got one that just simply says, say hi to my little friend.  All right.  Let's go to Fred.  Fred, you're next on WNEW.  How are you?  What's going on, guys?  Did you see how when the woman came out with the Ileon or whatever the hell his name is? 
[00:47:00]  And she ran into the bush.  Next time you see the watch, she runs into the bush.  It's funny.  That's not really what happened.  If you saw the woman from the crowd come in from the left, this INS agent takes her and  slams her into the ground.  Oh, yeah.  They weren't pulling around.  She went to Hoffman.  And then they pulled her out of the bush.  Felt like I was watching cops.  Oh, it was great.  One hand.  Took him down.  I was waiting for the drunk guy with the white beater shirt. 
[00:47:30]  Also, Anthony, with all the PlayStation games you play, that wasn't a grenade launcher.  No, I know.  It's the last time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're getting more slides.  They should have used the grenade launcher, but you should have blown the whole damn house  up.  After reviewing the picture, I realized, yes, it was indeed a flashlight.  Yeah.  I don't mean to make you feel bad, but...  That's okay.  All right.  All right, man.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  ...someone's saying they should have set the house on fire.  Ah, like Waco.  Yeah.  That would have been a fun ending for the story. 
[00:48:00]  How are they supposed to do a movie of the week about this if it doesn't end in total  tragedy?  A big cluster F.  There's still time.  There's still time for tragedy.  Friday, I agree.  Let's come back and replay Jill from Friday, the hot wax lady.  Yeah.  A lot of people are getting pissed when we said we'd get it out of four.  Yeah, that was really good.  So it was really, really good.  And if you did see it or hear it Friday, you can check out the pictures on foundrymusic.com,  and you can view the pictures as we replay the bit. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  Either way, it'll be cool radio, okay?  Yeah.  I'm going to cut the crap on this one so I can tell you there.  One-oh-two-seven-W-N-E-W.  I want to drink with that guy.  I'm going to cut the crap on this one.  Okay, terrific.  He comes up with the best stuff when the tape is just rolling,  and he doesn't realize they're recording him. 
[00:49:00]  That's how the old tape's riffing came about.  In between doing station liners, you know, Jimmy, who puts all that stuff together,  says to the voice guy, who's, I don't know, he's in Canada or something,  says, hey, man, we're done, we're cool here.  He goes, okay, terrific.  All sarcastic.  He didn't know we were rolling tape, and now, okay, terrific.  It's huger than huge, Anthony.  I love when people write us emails and stuff and say that that,  oh, I know where that clip is from.  It's from a movie back in 1970s. 
[00:49:30]  It's like, no, it's our voice guy.  And then they write back, no, no, you got it wrong.  He found it.  The okay, terrific guy.  Yeah, it's our voice guy for the radio station.  Okay, terrific.  All right, we got to play the hot wax girl, Anthony.  But first, Joe, real fast.  He's been waiting a long time.  Joe, what's up?  Yeah, what's going on?  Did you guys see Millionaire last night?  I did see Millionaire last night.  I can't be bothered with that show, but last night I checked it out for a little while.  Millionaire.  Yeah, I think they had their, I don't know if he was their first black contestant, 
[00:50:00]  but it was the first one I saw.  We had our first donkey.  Yeah, exactly.  Millionaire.  I heard you playing that clip earlier before you guys came on.  Yeah.  And I tell you, man, as soon as the guy comes up, you know, he greets him, shakes his hand.  Most everybody is like, yeah, how you doing?  Come on, let's go win a million dollars with this guy.  He goes, all right, my man.  All of a sudden, I'm hit.  Yeah, he's doing it like three times.  All right, my man.  Set my hot seat.  We all do that, though.  I do that all the time.  When I'm hanging with a brother, all of a sudden, my whole language changes. 
[00:50:30]  Yo!  I mean, it was so obvious for him.  You know, it was funny.  Me and I, the guy's like a doctor, and like, probably the only black guy that's got four  kids with the same woman.  That guy looked like a young Al Roker.  Yeah, he did.  A young female.  Was he the one that lost on the U.S. hockey team question?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, they don't know anything about hockey, those people.  He picked Sweden or somewhere with Finland.  Yeah.  Well, the question was, what team did the Americans beat for the gold medal back in  1980?  What did he say?  The Lakers? 
[00:51:00]  Is that your final answer?  And, yeah, there's a lot of people think that, you know, that we beat the Soviets for  the gold medal, but that was not true.  We had one more game after that.  Yeah.  And it was Finland, yes.  Oh, that's all.  Thanks a lot, guys.  All right, man.  Now, take a position in the hot seat.  Now, your people are probably very used to this being an interrogation, but it's a game  show.  Bless you, Rick.  Go home.  I wanted blacks, and I got them. 
[00:51:30]  Rick, go home.  Rick's sick again?  Yeah.  What do you got, FBA?  Dude, you're sick all the time.  Between him and his wife, they're sick like every other week.  Rick, you're sick all the time.  Go home.  You're sick all the time.  You're constantly congested.  You got married.  No, even before that, I remember him walking around with tissues, shoving in his nose, and  then he gets everyone else sick around here.  Rick, go home, please.  All right.  I'm serious.  Ant knows. 
[00:52:00]  You know that Opie's like one of those aliens from War of the Worlds.  Once the ship cracks open and some virus gets in there, it's all over.  Yeah, and I get sick forever.  You breathe the wrong way, and I get sick.  Shut up.  I haven't had swamp loop in a while, ass.  Wow.  Anthony, I can't believe you bring that up.  That's like taboo.  You want to get hit?  Yes.  You do?  I got it with you today.  I'm telling you.  What?  I'm pissed off with you today.  Wow.  Anthony fights back.  Ooh.  You're going to punch him up. 
[00:52:30]  Tough fight there.  You're going to punch him up.  See him try to chase you with that gimp leg?  That's what I'm saying.  Tough fight there.  Don't mention my swamp lip.  Oh, that thing is ugly.  There are two things you don't mention on this show.  You don't mention a couple things on this show.  One, I'll speak for myself.  Do not mention swamp lip.  And me, too.  I will speak for myself when I get the second nose growing on the side of my face.  I would gladly appreciate it.  Look at that.  I've seen that.  Of course you did.  How do you miss it?  It's like a frigging lighthouse. 
[00:53:00]  Everyone sees it.  You don't say anything.  It's kind of like that scene in Wayne's World with Kevin Pollack, who was in here a couple  weeks ago, with the eye.  Yeah.  You just make believe you don't see it.  You look away.  Or the other clip from Cheech and Chong with Strawberry.  He's got a birthmark on his face, man.  Don't look at it.  Yeah.  Hey, man.  We like to, whoa.  What's on your face, man?  He just blurted it right out.  Hey, what's on your face, man?  I don't acknowledge it when it happens.  The swamp lip pops up. 
[00:53:30]  Ben is the coolest guy around here.  Everyone else, what the F?  We all know.  And me, of course, in my 30s, and I still got to worry about my teenage acne.  For the love of Christ.  You know, when I hit my 20s, I thought, you know, thank God.  Finally, this will start going away.  Yeah.  Oh.  Dermatologist still.  Hello?  I need some Depend undergarments, some spare colostomy bags, and some Stridex pads. 
[00:54:00]  That's funny.  For the love of God.  Anthony, the limo guy, said, oh, yeah, I've noticed that before.  Yeah, no clapped.  Usually on the left-hand side.  Very good, Anthony.  Why are you looking at his face so close?  Sometimes I go into the bathroom, it'll blow my nose, and I grab the zit instead.  Oh, that's not it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, you're just, oh, man.  I'm like, Cyrano, Pinocchio. 
[00:54:30]  All right, listen.  See, there's the Pinocchio on the nose.  Then there's one on the chin, the Dudley Do-Right.  I like to call that one.  The chin kick out.  Then there's the jowl one, the Richard Nixon's, which you get on the side.  And then, yeah, right in the middle of the farhead, the Cyclops.  That's a good one.  Then just an errant cheek one, which is the conjoined twin from South Park.  You made your sense. 
[00:55:00]  That rocks.  Yeah.  That rocks.  That's fun, man.  That's good.  I just went to a new dermatologist, though.  He hooked me up with a pretty good description.  Yeah.  It's heroin.  It doesn't help, but it makes me really not care about it.  It makes you feel better, though.  Valium.  I just sleeped through the outbreak.  I was pretty impressed with that, huh?  I was pretty impressed with that last week.  Dude, I saw a guy on the elevator coming down from the skyboxes at the garden last night 
[00:55:30]  after the Knick game.  On his nose was something almost the size of a golf ball.  It was affecting his vision, and I'm like, whoa.  And everyone on the elevator, because you've got to look, but you've got to try to sneak  peeks and stuff.  Don't comment on it.  Oh, my God.  I feel so bad for this guy.  I've never seen one that big in my life.  Dude, it was like half the size of a golf ball like this on the sides.  Oh, my God.  It was the worst. 
[00:56:00]  They'd blow it out.  No, no.  This was one of those, like, Soviet Union things.  Like a big sister or something.  You know, like the Soviet Union ladies and stuff?  They have all those moles and stuff on their face.  You see them on the subway?  You don't see American girls with that crap.  It's only, like, the Romanians and the Soviets.  What the hell is that?  And the Czechs and stuff.  They're on the subway.  They speak some foreign language, and they have this crap all over their face.  It's a strong book we don't mention right now. 
[00:56:30]  I apologize.  He's like a grown-up fan.  Jimmy, what's going on?  What's going on, guys?  How's your back, O?  My back is still not 100%.  What's your clean time?  I'm up four days.  All right.  Keep coming back.  It works if it works.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Have a good one.  Maybe five.  Five days without Valium.  Thank you.  Five days Valium break?  All right.  You might have this thing kicked. 
[00:57:00]  It's a problem.  Your drug problem.  You asses.  I had one half of the Valium.  It can help my back.  All right.  Listen, let's, we've got to play Jill, because now they're going to just fry us up the steak here.  Yeah.  All right.  Jill came in Friday.  Hot.  Very, very hot.  A lot of people saw her, matter of fact.  She was at our party before we went on vacation about a month and a half ago when we did that  at La Barbeck.  She was one of the, she was the Italian girl that got on stage and got pretty much completely 
[00:57:30]  naked for us, just about.  Yeah.  Guys loved her ass.  And she came in here on Friday, and Matt and I were able to pour hot wax all over her  body.  Yeah.  We lit up some candles and just gripped hot wax on.  There's great pictures of this on foundrymusic.com.  Great, great pictures.  And at one point, my candle is melted into a cup shape at the top, and it was holding  up like a little puddle of hot wax, and I gave it a sidearm, like, swat, and it just  went all up her side. 
[00:58:00]  She was like, wow!  We have a new game, too.  We aim for the bullseye.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a balloon knot.  No, she was completely on her back, and, you know, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,  the, you know, we were nips.  The old days, I would have said it.  It was like, we were, we were, uh, dripping it onto the, uh, the bullseye.  Yeah.  Anyway, it was, it was a great little piece of, uh, radio.  A lot of people missed it because it was Good Friday, and you didn't work and stuff, so  we want to replay it here.  And if you did hear it on Friday, why don't you go to foundrymusic.com, so you can check 
[00:58:30]  out the pictures that we replay here, okay?  Don't worry about this.  We'll be back in just a minute to check this out.  We won't be the end of the day.  Well, you guys are both stupid.  You're like a black eye for all mankind.  I don't think they're very nice people.  The only way I could actually think they were funny was to be on heroin.  Hopi and Anthony.  You know, I just, like, want to throw up.  Feel the love.  1027 WNEW.  You're checking out the O&A show.  On this gorgeous Monday afternoon. 
[00:59:00]  Yes.  Finally a nice day.  About time.  What, did it rain for like a week straight?  Pretty nasty.  Cold.  Phone line 212-757-1027.  It's like the music I would be listening to if I barged into a Cuban house to grab young  Gileon.  I'd have this on the headphones.  Point my gun at people.  Hit the floor.  Hit the floor. 
[00:59:30]  This room's clear.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Get on the floor.  Get on the floor.  That would rock.  Yeah.  We discussed the Elyon thing for a little while there.  Yeah.  We discussed Janet Reno's...  Disgusted.  Package.  Her stuff.  Getting to the important issues on the O.P. and Anthony show today. 
[01:00:00]  Can we see your stuff?  No, no, no.  Thank you.  Janet?  Can we see your stuff?  No, no, no, no.  No, thank you.  She has junk, I'm sure.  Shaking junk.  Quivering junk.  Like having sex with a jackhammer.  All right, Anthony, let's move on with the radio show today.  Yeah, well, I was thumbing through the latest National Enquirer.  The one with the...  Why would they put Mr. Freeze from the old Batman thing on the cover of the Enquirer? 
[01:00:30]  Anthony, that would be Mr. Hope.  Oh, Bob Hope.  Fooled me again.  Fooled you once.  Let me tell you, though, they know how to sell rag magazines.  After the Knick game, I'm at Penn Station waiting for my train.  I saw that cover.  I had to pick it up.  Did they...  I had to check it out.  Did they doctor up his eyes with some red?  I don't know what the hell's going on with his eyes.  Or is that really him?  Bob Hope deathbed vigil.  They say he's dying.  They say he's been dying for 10 years.  Yeah.  What is he now, like 96?  Hey, all my friends are dead. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  Where's Bing?  Oh, dead?  Yeah, where's Dean Martin?  Oh, dead?  Yeah.  So now they're just waiting for him.  But, yeah, screw him.  Next page is even better.  They got...  Remember Daisy Duke?  Catherine Bach?  Yes.  From the Dukes of Hazzard TV show?  Very hot with those little, little, little cut-offs.  Daisy Dukes.  I know, Daisy Dukes.  They actually called them Daisy Dukes because she would wear the little cut-offs where half 
[01:01:30]  her ass was hanging out on the Dukes of Hazzard.  They got some pictures of her in here.  Oh, my God.  What, hot pictures?  Oh, yeah.  What?  Let me see.  Well, let's just...  Yeah, let's take it like that.  Ah!  What happened?  She was Daisy Duke.  I used to love when she jumped in the General Lee.  Now she's Daisy Puke.  Yeah.  No, she had the little Jeep, didn't she? 
[01:02:00]  She had like the Jeep Wrangler.  Yes.  She had to follow the Duke boys around in the General Lee.  And, oh, my God.  She has got the biggest gut.  You know how big her boobs are?  Yeah.  Her gut is sticking out further than her boobs.  Anthony, I believe that's called a bunt.  A bunt.  She now has a bunt.  Now them Duke boys are wondering, where did that bunt come from?  General Lee jumping over her bunt.  Trying to get away from her.  She's the new boss hog. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, man.  Time's a bitch, huh?  Time is a bitch.  She was like hot sex symbol of the early 80s.  Late 70s, early 80s.  A lot of people had her picture up in their little bedrooms growing up.  Yeah.  And then they had to put the contrast, the hot picture of her from the TV show.  Yeah.  Got her arms folded, holding her boobs up real nice.  Look at her waist.  It's tiny.  And her belly.  Teeny-weeny belly there.  All right.  Let's fast forward a few years.  Oh, here we go. 
[01:03:00]  You sure she's not pregnant in that picture?  No.  It says, and they try to give her a compliment.  Let's see.  Barbara Bach bearing her midriff these days, showing the effects of time and motherhood.  Because she's, you know, had a kid and stuff, a couple of kids.  So that's the effects of time and motherhood.  She's now 47.  And, but why is she wearing a little midriff top?  It looks, because she's, she used to wear them when she was in, you know, on Dukes of 
[01:03:30]  Hazard.  Yeah, but do you think she knows?  Do you think she still thinks she's Daisy Duke?  Well, she's got to keep up the image, Anthony.  Well, that ain't doing it.  No, I know.  And look, the side view, look at the big double chin.  It's just, time just blows.  Time blows, man.  Oh.  Yeah, I still think she's hot.  How about that brook shield?  Oh, yeah, there it is.  You remember this.  Just a good old boy. 
[01:04:00]  Never meaning no harm.  Beats on, you never saw.  Been in trouble with the law since the day they was born.  Yeah, sure.  Straight in the curb.  Flat in the hill.  Oh, terrific.  It's a mountain by a dinner, but the law never will.  Making that way, the only way they know how.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah. 
[01:04:30]  Okay.  That's just a little bit old.  There's a normal life.  It's a good old boy.  Yeah, yeah, well, okay.  What will change if they could?  Back in the city like a new modern-day Robin Hood.  Ah, there's our fantasy girl when we were growing up.  Time.  Daisy Puke.  But Bob Hope on the cover.  Wow.  Yeah, he's looking bad.  And then in the same rag magazine, they have a picture of Harrison Ford. 
[01:05:00]  God, these guys just love screwing people over, the Inquirer.  God bless them.  If you screw up in Hollywood or something, you don't even have to be in Hollywood.  They will catch you.  Montel.  They have a whole story in here about Montel's little chippy.  And when his wife saw the pictures in the Inquirer of Montel and his chick, she threw all his clothes out on the front lawn, threw his stuff out.  I personally didn't find that funny at all.  But at least Montel had a chance to get his clothes. 
[01:05:30]  They just happened to be on the front lawn.  On the front lawn.  Right.  Other people I know didn't have that chance.  No.  They were thrown in a dumpster.  I saw some guy walking around Huntington, some homeless guy, with an FM Talk at 1027 shirt.  And a wow cling on his shopping cart.  But, yeah, they nailed Harrison Ford this time.  All smiles as he hits Miami's red-hot South Beach scene.  Let me tell you, I was down there, what, about a month ago? 
[01:06:00]  And, yeah, South Beach, all stripped down there.  Just chicks, scantily clad, walking around.  They show him here in this car, in the back seat.  The car is loaded with chicks.  Loaded with, I mean, from a still picture, you can tell they're all drunk.  You can tell he's very drunk.  Yeah, he's just got this look on his face.  This chick's passing around, like, makeup.  They're all sloppy and stuff.  They got, like, their whore makeup on.  Which one's going to go first?  Yeah, which one's going to go first? 
[01:06:30]  Including four young beauties.  He had the star's wife nowhere in sight.  As revelers were a snap leaving a restaurant and heading off for a nearby club.  So I'm sure you'll be reading in future issues how Harrison Ford's stuff is laying up on the front lawn somewhere.  But he's like, I don't know, I guess you think of him as Indiana Jones or something.  But you know what he is?  He's just a horny guy.  He's a horny guy loose on South Beach.  Having a good old time. 
[01:07:00]  Having a good old time.  Look at him.  Dennis is pissed at us for making fun of the Dukes of Hazzard.  Dennis!  Hey, what's up?  How are you?  How are you guys?  Good.  Take it fast.  Your phone sucks.  I know.  I'm on the top of the bridge.  All right, guys.  Congrats.  Hey, I still watch Duke to Hazzard every day.  It's on twice a day.  Yeah?  How can you guys bust on them?  How can we bust on them?  You've got to see the picture of Daisy Duke in the latest National Enquirer.  She doesn't look as good as she used to, but, you know.  She's twice the woman she used to be. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, did I say Barbara Bach?  I'm getting reports.  It's Catherine Bach.  Catherine Bach, yeah.  Shut up, instant feedback people.  Shut up.  Well, they pick up on everything, Ant.  No.  All right, Dennis.  Thank you.  Take it easy, boys.  All right.  You have proven NEW is the world's largest music library.  Where the hell did you find the Duke's team?  It's in here.  A twofer.  We'll play Bewitched next.  Yeah, you've got to watch what you're doing, man. 
[01:08:00]  I hate that.  That lip smacking thing is disgusting, right?  You hear it on the radio.  But some good news, Opie.  Yeah?  In the Enquirer also.  Okay.  Come on, Scottsdale.  Scotty from Star Trek.  Remember him?  Of course. 
[01:08:30]  Remember Scotty?  What's his name?  James Doohan.  He's got to be pushing 80 at this point.  He is 80 years old.  80.  Wow.  Him and his lovely wife, Wendy.  How old is she?  Like 40?  43.  43.  Ice up.  Like I said, my wife's not born yet.  You could honestly say that and be right according to his math, I think.  That's right.  So, the proud papa, James Doohan, their parents. 
[01:09:00]  80 years old, this guy is a brand new daddy.  It's a little selfish.  I just think it's selfish.  What's going to happen now?  He's going to die.  Right.  The kid's going to...  I mean, if he does live...  Okay, figure...  He's...  The kid's 13 years old.  Scotty would be 93 when he starts having to maybe go to the schools for the father-son breakfast. 
[01:09:30]  Mm-hmm.  And you're taking a 93-year-old man...  Sure.  ...when all your friends' parents are like in their 20s and 30s or something.  We're in their 30s, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I'm sorry, eh.  Why, what's...  Oh, you got a caption for the picture?  Yeah, you know the famous picture of the Elian Gonzalez, C's?  Yeah.  Everyone's coming up with captions or, like, putting the picture in Photoshop and making their own pictures.  The latest one I got in my hand is Janet Reno as the stormtrooper with the gun. 
[01:10:00]  And Donato, the fisherman?  Yeah.  Holding spats.  Oh, my God.  Hey, that's pretty good.  That is funny.  That is good.  I just think it's a little selfish.  You know how cruel kids are.  Remember the father-son things you would go to or when your mother had to show up at a PTA thing?  Oh, like the pancake breakfast or, yeah, a little PTA action, sure. 
[01:10:30]  Remember how...  And the conference?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Remember how kind the children were when one of your friends' parents were maybe fat or old or stunk?  Or had lupus.  Or had lupus.  Or a wooden leg.  Yeah.  Or something.  Or a mustache.  Yeah.  I remember one kid.  His mother came in.  A beard and mustache.  Goatee.  Goatee?  Yeah.  And the kids look at her and go, now, don't be cruel because I'm sure she's a nice woman. 
[01:11:00]  Mm-hmm.  She just has some facial hair.  It doesn't mean...  Oh, yeah.  Hey, hey, hey.  Look at your mom.  Your mom's got a beard.  How big's your stuff?  Kids are cruel.  So, if he's alive at 93, could you see him wheeling in to the poor kid's school?  He'd be wheeling in like the grand pilot from South Park.  Somebody kill me!  Right.  And it won't even matter at that point that he was Scotty on Star Trek. 
[01:11:30]  No.  It'll just be the old guy.  He's not going to make it to 93.  I remember how bad it felt for, like, kids when the parents would show up.  And especially, like, the moms are one thing.  Because, you know, it's very rare that someone has an attractive mom.  And when the attractive mom would come in...  I remember all the attractive moms.  Yeah, but you remembered them.  But most of them weren't.  The attractive mom.  Those kids became my best friends.  So I could go over to their house and check out the mom.  Those are the ones you remember.  But then the dad thing was totally different.  Like, if the dad showed up and he was the little wormy, weaselly guy, 
[01:12:00]  you're just like, oh, that's the guy's dad?  You know, that's pathetic.  What's your dad do?  Oh, gee, your dad is like a data entry guy at the accounting firm.  Well, yeah.  You know?  What's wrong with that?  It just sucked as a kid.  You didn't want that.  See, J.D. from Hyde Park writing the obvious that we chose to pass on,  but we might as well say,  Scotty's wife can change the baby and Scotty at the same time.  Whack, whack. 
[01:12:30]  Whack, whack.  That old gag.  Or the guy's dad.  You know, because kids don't, remember you wanted some cool thing?  You know, my dad, for instance, was a private investigator, which was cool.  Your dad gave you cool stuff in general.  He gave you whores when you were like 12, 13.  Guns.  Guns.  Guns, horses, whiskey, and chicks.  Yeah.  Anthony's dad gave him guns, whiskey, and whores when he was 12 and 13.  And horses.  And horses.  Yeah, it was great. 
[01:13:00]  Rifles.  Anthony could have had the coolest dad in the world.  Yeah.  That rocks.  Yeah.  It was pretty cool.  Once he, you know, left New York and went to California.  Wasn't too cool living under the same roof with my mom and him.  No.  Oh, geez, here comes the big bowl of pasta heading toward the wall again.  Oh, Jesus.  It's going to be a real Donnybrook tonight.  I'll just go with Joe and Dawn and cower in the bedroom until it's over.  This won't affect me in the future.  Don't worry, you two just yell at each other. 
[01:13:30]  Once you get your little red wagon.  Yeah.  That movie was on TV.  What the hell?  The radio flyer.  The radio flyer.  Oh, the king's coming.  Remember that one?  Let's escape with our radio flyer and make believe it flies in the sky.  That'll make me forget about the beatings I'm getting every night.  No, they never told on us or anything.  They just couldn't stand each other.  Yeah.  My parents.  Oh, they were just yelling like all the time.  And don't worry about the line.  I learned my curses very young. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, yeah.  You mother effer.  Wah, wah.  You know.  Because my dad, he really didn't want to be married.  You know?  He had like kids and stuff.  And, you know, he'd like father, like son.  Well, I don't have kids.  I'm not ready to move out to California.  Not yet.  You know, so once he moved out to California, got his own life and stuff, and I went out there.  Oh, he hooked me up.  Was he your dad at that point, or was he like just your bud? 
[01:14:30]  Nah, he was like dad, you know.  Yeah.  Because I was still pretty young.  I was like 12, 13, 14, 15.  I don't know how many dads out there.  That bring you like a whore for your 13th birthday.  Well, when you're 13 and stuff, you know, it's time to make the big jump into manhood.  Anthony at 17.  What was the name of that show?  James.  James at 15.  James at 15, then James at 16, and then James at 17.  James at 17, when he finally got laid.  Yeah.  When the show went off the air.  Yeah. 
[01:15:00]  Anthony at 14, what a hot looking blonde model.  No, no, it wasn't no hot looking blonde model, believe me.  No, her name was Buzz.  Buzz.  Buzz.  Anthony's first lady was named Buzz.  It was Buzz.  Buzz.  To infinity.  She always had a buzz on.  She was always tanked.  That was great, though.  I went out there, bought me a nice horse.  Mm-hmm.  Big, uh, big black horse and, uh, guns.  I remember my birthday.  I think it was like my 12th birthday. 
[01:15:30]  Got a nice Ruger Super Single 6 six-shooter.  Oh, God.  I got a strap-tie that thing down to my leg.  I had you bought me the holster that ties like right above the knee.  I went riding, shooting everything that moved.  I didn't care.  You know, I got a shiny bike.  I think it was my first 10-speed.  And then, uh, you got a six-shooter.  I got a 10-speed.  Then, uh, he got a dune buggy.  Yeah.  I didn't even have a license, but he's like, yeah, okay, go, go run the dune buggy. 
[01:16:00]  Have a grab some beer.  Really?  Yeah.  I jumped and, uh, wah, wah, wah.  It was great.  It was like, uh, it was like camp.  That is awesome.  Then I came back here and it was like, uh-oh, reality, you know.  I better go to school and try to do something with my life.  That lasted for a week.  You got some great stories, man.  Oh, I've had fun.  Great stories.  My favorite, I know you've told it a million times, is the Uncle Pot story. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, yeah.  Either that or, uh, Joe's Pot story, your brother.  Were you?  Yeah.  Were you?  That was, uh, that was back here in New York.  Actually, I don't think you've told that one in a long time.  I was, uh, living over in Huntington.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, we had just seen something in school.  Um, I was still in Cuba Hill Elementary School.  And, uh, we'd seen something on drugs.  Identifying drugs, Opie.  Marijuana.  They showed us the leafs and everything.  Sure.  Very dangerous drugs. 
[01:17:00]  Stay away.  Stay away.  Um, so, uh, I went into the woods, because, you know, there's woods right near the house,  and that's where we used to hang out.  And, uh, I came across marijuana, Opie.  And I saw it, and I went, I've just seen this.  It's marijuana.  Right.  And the plants were, like, two feet tall, weren't even, like, mature yet.  They were in this ditch.  Was there a lot of them?  Yeah, there were about 20.  20 plants in a ditch.  In a big, long, trough ditch, covered with, uh, glass.  So, I guess the heat from the sun. 
[01:17:30]  In the middle of the woods.  Like, where the guy must have planted it and just gone, this is the perfect spot.  No one will ever find it.  Sure.  I could bury a body.  Make it his own little greenhouse in the middle of the woods.  Yeah.  So, I found it.  I was like, oh, marijuana.  Well, I, I must harvest this up and, and show my mom that I know what pot looks like,  and I'm doing my part against drugs.  So, I rip the glass off, and I rip up 20 plants and bring them back to the house.  Mom, look, marijuana.  She's like, oh, well, that's good.  You found that.  Meanwhile, she's, like, probably, like, oh, geez, you pull off a few leaves. 
[01:18:00]  Let me smoke that.  The plants weren't even mature yet.  Yeah.  So, she goes, well, just take it out back and step on it on the cement.  It's like, okay.  So, I take it all back.  I'm very proud doing my part, Opie.  And, uh, started smashing them.  I look up at the house.  My brother is in the living room window.  Uh, uh, looking out of the curtains, and I swear, when the sunlight hit him perfectly,  I saw a glimmer of a tear run, run down his cheek.  Like, like the old Indian from the. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, like the littering Indian.  The littering Indian, sure.  Yeah, he was, he was just devastated.  Uh, it turns out the weed belonged to the guy that lived next door, him and his biker friends.  Oh, yeah.  So, Joe knew, you know, it was, uh, probably not too cool if anyone found out it was me.  So, he ran right outside and scooped up any evidence that was left.  Waited for my mom to leave.  Put it on some tin foil and shoved it in the oven to quick dry it.  And smoked till he got the worst headache of his life.  And, uh, they blamed it on some guy that lived down the street and beat the living crap out of this guy. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, not cool.  This guy, innocent guy, got bludgeoned because I was doing my part against marijuana.  See?  When you try to help, that's when the people got hurt.  And I tried to do my part.  And then, uh, later on in life, I spent many, many nights on that next door house, a smoking pot.  You went on to the dark side. 
[01:19:30]  And hash oil.  Yeah, yeah.  Smoking that under a glass, I assume.  A little pin, right?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  The good old days.  Someone says I sound like a psychopath because, uh, guns at a young age, violent video games.  No, that's what keeps me level-headed.  I was the Wrangler, Opie.  I know you were.  Let's take a break, Anthony.  We'll be back.  You guys have deteriorated beyond belief right now.  Please. 
[01:20:00]  Opie and chance of the show.  Thank you.  1027 WNEW.  Hey, New York, this is Vince McMahon of the WWF, and you're listening to the greatest tag team in radio.  Opie and Anthony on 1027 WNEW.  Ah, thank you, Vince.  Thank you, Vince McMahon.  I love turning my children out like whores.  Dress Stephanie up like a young slutbag.  Come on, Triple H.  Banger in the behind. 
[01:20:30]  Of course, Raw is war tonight.  The storyline's getting very interesting.  Stone Cold's going to be performing at the, uh, the next pay-per-view.  Big article in the paper about wrestling, too, today.  Oh, yeah?  They're trying to get the drug testing going on once again in, uh, in the wrestling world, Anthony.  Oh.  Uh, there's a bunch of, uh, lawmakers trying to push a controversial legislation that would further regulate, uh, wrestling in New York.  They want, uh, the wrestlers to take mandatory drug tests because they are role models, Anthony.  What?  Is that the reasoning? 
[01:21:00]  Uh, that's what they're pretty much saying, yeah.  The performers are role models and shouldn't be involved with banned substances.  Do you care if the wrestler is, like, pumping up on juice as long as they look, uh, like they're, uh, uh, kicking ass out there?  I could care a lot.  Yeah, that's fun.  Vince McMahon, uh, did something brilliantly, uh, brilliantly, uh, a few years back, Anthony.  Yeah.  Uh, there was a lot of, uh, problems with, uh, drugs and wrestling.  Yeah.  All right?  And, uh, there was, uh, there were some, um, states banning his wrestling. 
[01:21:30]  Because it was.  Certain arenas and stuff.  Classified as a sport.  Right.  A sporting event, and, and, uh, athletes would have to be drug tested.  And, uh, Vince McMahon refused to have his wrestlers, uh, wrestlers drug tested.  Mm-hmm.  But he still wanted to, uh, have his shows in these cities.  Right.  And we're not, we're not, uh, claiming that there's, uh, you know, drugs being abused in,  uh, the WWF.  But what Vince did was turn around and tell everyone that wrestling's fake.  It's all fake.  And it's entertainment.  Yeah.  And with that said, now you can't, uh, you know, test the guys because they're not athletes. 
[01:22:00]  Doesn't matter.  Right.  It's like testing a band.  Right.  Would you test, uh, drug test a band that's going to be playing at the Garden?  No.  Imagine that.  Hey, look at that.  That show would suck.  That would suck.  Let's test Ozzy.  That would be off the charts.  So, Vince, in the paper said pretty much the same thing you just said.  Uh, that means you should go and, uh, test all the Broadway performers or, or everyone that's  performing in a circus.  Hey!  Hey!  Or everyone that's, uh, performing in a circus. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  Because it's the same thing, basically.  Yep.  Entertainment.  All entertainers, so.  Like I said, I don't care.  I don't care if, uh, they end up like Lyle Alcedo with a big monkey growing in their head.  Remember Paul Lyle Alcedo?  I forgot all about him.  Big, hulking football player.  Mm-hmm.  He was on the roids.  Mm-hmm.  He retires after, like, numerous bones just kept cracking as he's trying to do strenuous  activity, like get out of bed.  Yeah.  And, uh, then he got that big brain tumor that took him out in like a week. 
[01:23:00]  Huge tumor.  Boom.  Oh, gone.  What's the price you pay?  You know, you want to, uh, burn the candle at both ends with your body.  Well, I think the people that are taking the roids understand the, the risks that are involved.  Mm-hmm.  Sure.  You're going to pump up.  It's none of our business.  Really isn't.  No.  I don't care.  They're not doing it.  Like I said, as long as it's entertaining to me.  They're not doing it in front of the kids.  Yeah. 
[01:23:30]  If they're doing it at all.  Yeah.  A role model.  Do they, do they, uh, juice up in the ring?  I don't think so.  What they do behind closed doors is their own business.  I don't know.  As long as they're not.  I don't care what they do.  Hurting each other or others.  A role model.  A role model or not.  These athletes should be able to do whatever kind of drugs they want.  Talking about wrestling.  Not a man.  You never see, you never hear those breaks over there.  No.  And I guess we're still allowed to make fun of Mike and the Mad Dog because they have 
[01:24:00]  a sense of humor.  Yeah, talk about the roller derby.  They have a sense of humor.  What?  Not if you ask Mike.  Some people in the company don't have a sense of humor and, uh, don't want to be made fun  of.  That's all I'm trying to say.  I know.  Some of them, like Mike and the Mad Dog, they're, they're cool.  They never, you know, cried to anyone about making fun of them.  I'm cool, too.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Uh, what?  Nothing.  No?  No comment.  Maybe I just don't know what you're talking about me. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Maybe.  Someone's got to punch him in the side of the head in the morning, man.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He doesn't look.  Ah, shut up, Bernard.  He doesn't look awake in the morning.  Mm-hmm.  5.41.  Oh, I said that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Where's a Billy Saul Hargis bit?  Can I rerun one of those from, uh, you know, 1978 or something?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  M-B-Z.  You want to order a thousand hamburgers? 
[01:25:00]  A thousand hamburgers bit.  No, that was funny.  It wasn't.  Yeah, yeah.  How'd it go?  I forgot.  I got that CD so much.  That's like the worst prank call I've ever heard.  How's my, uh, my big fag cowboy hat today?  I don't think I got that CD with us today.  If you find it, that'll be a great find.  Is it looking good?  My big fag cowboy hat, baby.  And my, uh, bandana I wear around my neck.  I'm like a big fag cowboy, baby.  Hides the, uh, the, uh, chicken skin on my neck. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Now, shut up, McCord, jerk.  You see that, um, uh, uh, Janet Reno?  Yeah, everyone.  That whole, uh, damn, uh, Ilium Gonzalez thing.  Yeah, everyone talking about that.  Baby.  You must have some great...  Ah, they're all just stupid.  I mean, they barge in, uh, with the, uh, uh, the, uh, the, um, the guns. 
[01:26:00]  The guns, right.  You know, uh, my, uh, brother sells a salsa.  Yeah, yeah.  Baby, salsa.  On WNBC.  Wait, where am I?  Uh, the fan, I believe.  The fag?  The fan.  The fan.  The fan, yeah.  Imus in the morning program.  Is that all you have on me?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Julian Gonzalez?  Um, he's, uh, the father.  He's the father.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And, and?  And, uh. 
[01:26:30]  And, uh.  I think he's a kid toucher.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Baby.  Bill is Saul Hargis.  Now watch out, Ilium.  Moby Worm coming to get you.  I see him right now.  He's coming down, uh, to Miami.  We got him on our radar right now, and I'm seeing, uh, Moby Worm, baby.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't care if it rains or freezes, as long as I got my plastic Jesus riding on the dashboard of my car.  5.43 in the afternoon, why am I on? 
[01:27:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, very nice.  Uh, what about the, um, Ilium's, uh.  Ilium's.  That, uh.  That, uh.  Cousin.  The cousin, the hot cousin?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, baby.  Yeah.  Ed?  Oh, shut up, Bernard.  What a slut.  Not her, Bernard.  You think she takes it in the balloon nut?  Uh.  I'd like to, uh, think that.  Yeah. 
[01:27:30]  I just hope, uh, hope she shaves so it's as bald as Bernard's head.  Oh, shut up, Bernard.  You do my cord.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hoop.  My shift done yet?  Uh, no, not yet.  Hmm.  I see the, uh, CNBC cameras on me.  Yeah.  Right now.  I'm trying to look my best.  Yeah.  So I, uh, I take a thread.  Yeah.  And sew the back of my neck together to try to pull the, uh, skin out. 
[01:28:00]  I see that.  Yeah, yeah, it ain't working, baby.  No.  I got Moby Worm under my chin.  Where's that cousin?  Sit on my face and practice Spanish.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Baby, Moby Worm in my pants.  Where's my young wife?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Quack, quack.  What about, uh, that, uh, uh, Fidel, uh, Castro?  Who?  Fidel Castro.  Yeah, what's up with him? 
[01:28:30]  With that, um, that, uh, beard.  What about it?  It looks stupid.  Yeah.  What a jerk.  Is it 546 yet?  No, not yet.  Quack, quack.  Time check.  All right, 545 in 38 seconds.  Need material, baby.  Yeah.  In the, uh, news?  Yeah.  Nick's had a great, uh, win last night.  Oh, well.  Yesterday afternoon, whatever.  Rudy's, Rudy's wife is doing the vagina monologue. 
[01:29:00]  Vagina monologue, baby.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, uh, with Rudy, uh, in the, um, Senate race.  Right.  Uh, fighting for that minute.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Vagina chronicles, or monologue, baby.  But, but, yeah, the monologues.  Monologue.  Vagina monologues, yeah.  You got that, uh, Hargis bit, uh, cued up?  No, not yet.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I got my fag cowboy hat on.  Did I mention that?  Yeah, you did already.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, that Janet Reno's, uh, man.  Uh.  Hey, look, I, I got out a full idea.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  What's up with that?  Yeah, yeah.  Aw, shut up, McCord.  Yeah, uh, Reno's face looks like, uh, Bernard's ass.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey, another idea, baby.  Look at that, a complete sentence. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Quack, quack.  Still five.  Quack.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Shut up.  Wow.  See, kids, that was a parody.  That was a parody.  Hmm, doesn't mean we, we hate the company or that station, or hate the man himself.  Oh, damn me, boys, ain't no one. 
[01:30:30]  If you want to be syndicated like Mr. Amos, you, you can't be talking to him, Mr. Amos.  See, uh, Mr. Amos uses character.  Right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Baby, mobile work.  Coming right down 57th over to 7th.  Going to grab up Obi and Anthony.  Moby Worm coming to get you, baby.  It's, uh, Fat Nard looks over there, covering up his bald head. 
[01:31:00]  Shut up.  Shut up, Bernard.  Jerk.  Where's the, uh, CNBC camera?  Right there.  Oh, thank you.  Uh, can maybe Spielberg do some tricks and make me look good?  God damn, I look like I'm melting.  5.40.  Uh, Mike, what's up? 
[01:31:30]  Hey, what's up?  How are you?  Good.  Looks like you guys got another month handed on to your, uh, syndication.  Hang on another month.  I don't know when the hurry is going to be, but it is another month.  You boys will never learn.  Another click and, uh, another check and the stupid column.  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  We assume we can make fun of the people that have a sense of humor, right? 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  A what?  A sense of humor, sir.  I'll look that up.  Maybe.  Thousand Hamburgers.  Moby Worm.  Reverend Billy Saul Hargis.  I'm five, four...  Did I mention my brother's salsa?  Uh, yes. 
[01:32:30]  You pretty much mentioned everything today.  I'm thinking of a mud-eyed cowboy hat.  Where, uh, you dip chips that are shaped like my big fag bandana in the big fag cowboy hat and pull out my brother's salsa, baby.  Oh, I'm going to move to the ranch out there now.  Where the hell is he?  We are.  Arizona, New Mexico?  Yes.  Oh, shut up.  We are being dumped out of?  Left and right.  Hmm. 
[01:33:00]  We are?  We are up here yet?  What, you can't mention that?  Yeah, where's the Van Halen song?  Aw, come on.  You can't talk about Mr. Amos?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, that should be allowed.  It's fun.  Parody.  Yeah.  Wow, what do they dump out of?  Huh.  Aw, that's odd.  I miss?  I miss my train.  Yeah, we'll just keep going. 
[01:33:30]  The lay will run out.  Amos, Amos, Amos.  Morning, morning, morning.  Oh, boy.  Oh, well.  Can't do anything anymore.  Just trying to have fun.  Wow.  They're really dumping out like crazy?  That's what everyone's saying.  I thought we were able to talk about that.  When you say the time they are dumping out.  Amos in the morning program. 
[01:34:00]  Amos in the morning program.  Amos in the morning program.  I'm waiting for the Van Halen to kick in.  Amos in the morning program.  Amos in the morning.  O.B. and Anthony.  Fun to let you go.  You guys are really funny and stuff.  But you guys take it too far to the point where I literally get nauseous and sick listening to your radio show. 
[01:34:30]  Go take a Mital.  1-0-2-7.  1-0-2-7.  1-0-2-7.  1-0-2-7.  1-0-2-7.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Yeah.  What?  What?  I thought we were all just having fun, right?  What happened?  All right.  We will let you in on what we just had to listen to for the last 10 minutes, okay?  This is a reenactment.  Now, I thought we were clear on what we weren't going to be doing on this program. 
[01:35:00]  How much more clear do we have to be?  You boys can't be doing that.  I've said it a thousand times.  Look, we think you're very talented.  You're going to go far in this company.  You're doing very well for the station and for the company.  But not damn, we will throw you out of the house and crap through a goose.  It's because you don't knock this off.  Why are you too stupid? 
[01:35:30]  You are stupid.  Stupid.  We make policy for reasons around here.  Not to be broken by the likes of you so we can play Van Halen more than Q104.  Well, I've got to explain to everyone.  When they run out of dump time, when we're being bad,  they turn off the station and they go to the Ain't Talking About Love song. 
[01:36:00]  How the hell do you run out of dump time when you're on a dump as long as you?  Unless you blatantly break some station policy.  Allow me to reiterate from Ken Stevens.  Effective immediately on making station policy.  No one discusses any other infinity station or air personality in any way.  Not even as a comedy little bit that you do on your program.  If you have a problem, see me, Ken Stevens. 
[01:36:30]  Not me, because I'm the other guy down in Washington.  I just punch up on the telephone every time and get nauseated.  With your blatant disrespect of station policy.  Holy Jesus, Palomino.  I go down the hall.  I'm like, what's the problem?  I just get a memo in my face.  Not a word. 
[01:37:00]  Just a memo.  Comes flying at me.  I don't get it.  Don't forget the sexual harassment video.  Hey, boy, look.  I heard you watch the sexual harassment video that our company put together.  Yeah.  At great cost and effort.  Yeah.  To teach everyone who works for this company about sexual harassment and how to avoid it in the workplace. 
[01:37:30]  And I hear you boys just laughing at it.  Ha, ha, laugh, laugh, laugh your ass off.  You'll be laughing out the door all the way to the unemployment line.  God damn it.  We had station employees acting the roles.  And you were making fun of bad acting?  Did you happen to see who was playing the guy behind the computer whacking it to the porno?  That was me.  I thought I did an Emmy Award winning appearance. 
[01:38:00]  You boys break every rule.  And make fun of the God damn sexual harassment video.  Didn't you see when I pulled that girl's head into my lap?  That was sexual harassment.  I was doing that purely for the videotape to teach you.  And you mocked it.  Now look, you boys are very talented.  We like you.  We wouldn't have taken you aboard this company if we didn't think you could go very far. 
[01:38:30]  But you've got to tell the line.  You boys don't understand the rules.  We will throw you out.  Wait, my other phone's ringing.  Hold on.  Hello?  No, I don't know what the hell I do here.  Okay.  Hello, boys.  Hi.  Fly straight. 
[01:39:00]  I don't understand you, boy.  Straight and narrow, and you'll go far.  You've been with this company a long time, like Dan Raddick.  If I hear you ain't talking about love one more time, I swear to God you're out the door.  Okay.  All right, boys.  Wink, wink.  I don't get it. 
[01:39:30]  I didn't say anything.  Are you nuts?  I didn't say anything.  It's just my deep voice guy.  It's the Ivan in the Afternoon program.  No, no, no.  Why?  Why?  You ever heard Ivan in the Afternoons?  No, I haven't.  It's a funny show.  I haven't heard Ivan.  And then, yeah, he's got a brother, Phil, in Montana.  He makes dip. 
[01:40:00]  He wears a derby and a bolo tie.  I see.  It's great.  I've heard of Spike and the Angry Wolf.  They do a good afternoon drive show.  Yeah.  What we have here is a failure to communicate.  Oh, boy.  I'm waiting to hear that from the guy.  What we've got here is failure to communicate. 
[01:40:30]  Now, you boys want a long career with our organization.  Look how long Danny Ryder's been with us.  Look how long he's been on there.  He's been dead 10 years.  He's still working with the company.  But we like him.  He doesn't make fun of anybody else.  And we want you boys to die here, too.  Sooner than later, for the love of God.  I should have known when we hired him after freaking killing the mayor of Barnes and this 
[01:41:00]  was going to be trouble.  They flew down to Washington, met me.  I thought everything was cool.  They pulled the wool over my eyes and bamboozled me like Satan.  You can't make a deal with the devil.  You never win.  It sounds good.  You think you have all your bases covered.  But before you know it, you've got a pitchfork in your ass. 
[01:41:30]  That was two years ago.  Yeah, it was.  A little plane trip to Washington.  Oh, you boys look okay.  Go back to New York.  Good luck.  Goddamn, I could bite my goddamn tongue off for saying that.  Two years ago, we had to fly down to Washington to meet the guy behind the voice.  Yeah.  And he wanted to just make sure we didn't have horns in our head, and then he sent us  on our way.  Remember that day?  Yes, sir.  We do regret what we did in Boston.  It was a simple little joke gone awry. 
[01:42:00]  We will never do anything like that again.  It totally got out of hand.  We blame it mostly on management who didn't intervene at an earlier date and could have  maybe saved the whole thing.  We are but entertainers who would love to entertain for your company, sir.  I hope you look okay.  Go to NAW.  Have fun.  Fast forward one month.  Goddamn, boys! 
[01:42:30]  Don't give me a heart attack!  That was the best, though.  Oh.  Before NAW was allowed to hire us, we had to fly down to meet the guy behind the voice.  Yeah.  We flew from Boston to Washington.  We took a 45-minute cab ride to his office.  We met with him for a total of five minutes.  Five minutes.  He made sure we didn't have horns in our head.  We were, like, dressed in suits.  Just in suits. 
[01:43:00]  I assumed I'm going to be in Washington for the night and have dinner and drinks and stuff.  We were in his office for five to seven minutes.  He goes, all right, wait, I'm fine for your cab.  Right.  He goes, okay, I'm satisfied.  I'll let them hire you.  And he goes, can I call you a cab?  Yeah.  And then we had to take the 45-minute cab ride back to the airport.  Then we were in Boston for dinner.  It was the most bizarre day of my life.  I should have killed you when I had the chance.  Oh, man. 
[01:43:30]  You were right in front of me.  Right before me.  Beezle bulb right there, right in front of my eyes.  And I didn't see it.  Can't enable.  I should have killed his bulb.  This is coming in.  Anthony, you have bigger balls than Jennery.  I didn't come in.  Oh, please.  Well, all right.  You've got to be good, Opie.  I was good.  For the first time, I was good.  Hey, isn't you just doing this break in the middle? 
[01:44:00]  Just doing this impression, God damn it.  Is it really?  Technically.  I didn't discuss any other, well, no, no, no.  Station or air personality.  Hi-hi, your free game.  Joe, what's going on?  Hey, Joe.  Hey, I read a rumor that they're going to hold back syndication in now 17 years.  I read it on the New York Radio message board, or are we going to devour that now?  We had syndication right in our arms, and it was ripped away by an armed guy in a helmet. 
[01:44:30]  Who is it, Earl?  All right.  Hey, don't forget Paisano's lunch specials.  Thank you, Joe.  Joe Soprano.  I'm sure Joey appreciates it.  Yes.  All right, man.  My boy, Steve.  Bye.  Bye.  Let's go to John real quick.  I love the pasta.  Hey, John, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Pretty well.  Okay.  That's good.  You guys got to stop making fun of your boss, because you've got to get kicked off of that  now.  I don't think he listens. 
[01:45:00]  What?  What?  What?  Never welcome back, Connor.  What?  What?  Where?  Why?  What happened?  All right, John.  Thank you.  All right.  I'm a step.  We don't know what he's saying.  I don't know.  Frank, what's up?  What's up, guys?  How are you?  Anthony, you've got to stop.  What?  We love you.  You get me through the afternoons.  You know, I was walking around with my transistor radio in my head around the office, because 
[01:45:30]  I didn't want to miss a second of this.  It was so funny.  But when you start doing, you know, the Danny Umis shoe show in the morning, they're going  to fire your ass, man.  You're gone.  And it's going to be the Rick and Opie show.  No.  No.  No.  That won't happen.  If one goes, the other goes.  I swear to God.  If you can't take a chance, we'll get another freak.  That's the truth.  Thank you, Frank.  All right, guys.  Bye.  Just trying to do good radio here.  Let's go to Don on line 10.  Don.  Yeah.  How you doing, boys? 
[01:46:00]  I just want you boys to know that it's okay for you to...  Knock it off!  I don't know who that guy was trying to imitate.  James, what's up?  All right.  Okay.  Doug, what's up? 
[01:46:30]  Hey, what's going on?  I'm just seeing what you guys did.  I came out of the store.  I heard the radio.  I heard him talk about love.  What are you guys up to now?  We ran out of delay.  Let's just put it that way.  They turn the key when they run out of delay, and then they put music on, and it happened  once again today.  Jesus.  There's no way I can compare you to, like, you're the two kids in the back of the classroom  that just makes fun of everyone.  It's no way I can compare you. 
[01:47:00]  I just wish we knew when to stop.  We're like the crack man.  We're trying to stop, but...  I have to slow down.  But we're always jonesing.  You can't get off the crack pipe.  We're trying to cut back.  We're trying to stop, but, man, it's right in front of us.  I don't like your say-now, pay-later policy.  The first step is admitting it.  All right, Doug.  Thank you.  All right.  All right, let's go to Steve real fast.  Steve, what's up?  Yeah, Anthony, you better stop booking some more Band-Aids. 
[01:47:30]  You might need it.  You're the best when you go over the line.  Yeah.  You're only making money.  Yeah, well, for some reason, that doesn't matter.  Hey, Opie, you better take up an instrument.  Take care.  All right, man.  Oh, well, I guess that bit's done.  Steve, what's going on?  Steve?  Yo.  How are you?  I just called before because I wanted to make sure you weren't playing some more archive stuff, 
[01:48:00]  and you were still there, and your asses weren't out on the street.  No, I think that was okay, right?  Oh, listen, I think that stuff is like the funniest stuff there is that you guys do.  Ron Ivan.  Ivan in the evening program.  In the old days, you used to be able to make fun of everyone,  but now that, like, only two people own every station in New York, it makes it very tough.  Yeah.  It's unbelievable how corporate America...  We're just trying to have fun.  Corporate America's taking over, and it's just so PC now. 
[01:48:30]  You can't make fun of anybody.  Trust me.  We would love to make fun of, like, Scott and Todd or something, but there's nothing there.  Nothing funny there to make fun of.  There's nothing there.  Rocky Allen, he got fired today.  Well, we can make fun of that a little bit.  Rocky Allen program.  Who are we going to make fun of?  There's nothing out there.  We own the...  This company owns the guys you want to make fun of, because they got the personalities that are, you know...  Yeah, see?  I always thought it was a good thing.  Sort of like cross-promotion in a twisted kind of way, but... 
[01:49:00]  Sure.  I mean, we're going to own MTV soon.  I guess we're not going to be able to make fun of MTV soon.  Yeah, what are we going to make fun of?  The Q of the day.  I'm the kid.  There's no one to make fun of on Q104.  Two for Tuesday.  Two for Tuesday.  You guys should rename that song, Ain't Talking About Syndication.  Yeah, we need a new song.  Yeah, we need something that's more appropriate. 
[01:49:30]  Highway to hell or something.  Poor John, the dumb guy, man.  Just seeing him come in, he was all sweating, and he was...  I swear to you, I'm not kidding, he was waving a white flag.  He had a white piece of cloth, and he's like, enough, please.  He ran out of delay.  Get that arm guy from Little Havana to rescue John from the dump room.  John Gonzalez.  John Gonzalez.  All right, let's go to line seven.  Sir?  Hello.  Yeah. 
[01:50:00]  Shut up, Opie.  Ah, shut up.  Debbie, what's going on?  I just wanted to say goodbye to you guys.  I heard the FBI was coming in in full assault gear to take you out of the station.  Yeah, you're going to see me and Opie crying as we're being pulled away.  I'll miss you on my drive home.  It just won't be the same anymore.  Who's going to replace you?  If they're going to rip me out of the studio, though, if they're going to rip me out of the studio, I hope they, you know, send like a Playboy model instead of that bookie lady they sent for E.D. on. 
[01:50:30]  Will you be in your pajamas?  Yes, I will.  My little PJs.  My little PJs.  I got feety pajamas.  All right, guys, take care.  Thank you, Debbie.  Bye.  We better take a break, Anthony.  All right, Scott from Weehawken, I hear a very, very annoying laugh in the background.  Yeah, that's Anthony.  Anthony, you are so annoying to people on the instant feedback.  They can't stand you.  Limo guy.  Really?  All right.  Yeah, you have one of those sitcom laughs.  That's good.  When you're trying to watch an old episode of Mary Tyler Moore or Happy Days or something, you have over the regular laugh of the audience. 
[01:51:00]  Say that.  That's the, all right.  You hear the regular laugh, and then there's like a.  Freeze!  Freeze!  Oh, no, Psycho Marcus is taking me away.  You're coming with me!  Earlier this afternoon, Anthony from the Ovi and Anthony show, taken out of the studio by armed INS agents and sent to Cuba by some southern guy from Washington. 
[01:51:30]  Please don't own NBC soon, because we don't want to lose the chance of making fun of Tom Brokaw.  I'm trying to work a deal out with Brokaw.  He ain't coming over here and let your boys shut up.  I'm talking about Bill Butel or something.  He's dead.  He's not dead yet.  He just looks at him.  Oh.  You idiot.  We're running out of things to make fun of.  What if we let you drink in the studio again? 
[01:52:00]  Okay, when I cure things, God damn it.  All right, Ann, let's take a break, okay?  Oh, but if we take home, we might not be there.  They're waiting outside.  We need our protesters outside the studio every day to make a human chain.  Human chain.  Yeah, they'll be asleep, too.  Whisked away over sleeping bodies outside.  They'll just slowly step over them.  Knowing our listeners.  Okay.  All right. 
[01:52:30]  Okay, terrific.  A gigantic boombox is coming down the street.  Hand me the RPG-7.  He and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  Hey, Anthony.  Yes?  The Vermont Teddy Bear Company.  Yes.  Maybe we could send one to our big boss in Washington to smooth things over.  Smooth things over a little bit? 
[01:53:00]  Let's smooth things over with the big boss man down in Washington.  Send him a Vermont Teddy Bear.  Why not?  We would call up a bear counselor, 1-800-829-BEAR, and tell him a little something about the boss down in Washington.  And they would come up with a bear that would suit him.  Right.  Real boss bear?  Mm-hmm.  The business bear?  Or the voodoo boss bear?  Oh, I want one of those for myself.  Please take the pin out of me.  Take the pin out, okay? 
[01:53:30]  Bosses, Bosses, Secretary's Day is this Wednesday.  Wow.  Hey, we just watched the sexual harassment video, too.  There's probably some inappropriate ways to give a Vermont Teddy Bear.  You don't want to go up, squeeze her cans, and then give her the bear.  Right.  That's bad.  I learned.  We learned that.  Sure.  You don't want porno on your computer screen when you're calling her over to give her the Vermont Teddy Bear?  No.  Do something different this year.  Surprise your exceptional assistant with a bear gram gift from Vermont Teddy Bear.  Great way to show your appreciation in a way that's original and fun. 
[01:54:00]  And what do they get?  A beautiful bear, handcrafted in Vermont, delivered with a personalized card, candy in a colorful gift box.  For some reason, my throat hurts.  I wonder why.  I don't know.  If you stop yelling, maybe you can get me to goddamn some commercials.  Thank you, boss.  A bear gram gift, creative change of pace from flowers, and will be enjoyed forever. 
[01:54:30]  You're a psychopath.  I know.  You're like Anthony Hopkins from that movie Magic.  You've got two weird personalities going on over there.  When he talks like the boss, he's convinced he's the boss.  I'm the boss.  I am.  For everything your assistant does, for you all year, they deserve the best.  Vermont Teddy Bear Company.  Guaranteed overnight delivery, so your assistant's bear will arrive on time.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Want to give him the number and all the other info? 
[01:55:00]  Oh, yes.  I can do that, Anthony.  Call 1-800-829-BEAR.  That's 1-800-829-BEAR.  Or shop online at VermontTeddyBear.com.  It's the creative alternative to flowers for Secretary's Day, which is this Wednesday, Mother's Day, or any occasion.  Mother's Day, right around the corner.  This would be a great gift, guys.  That's 1-800-829-BEAR.  1-800-829-BEAR.  Tell them Opie and Anthony from any WCEN show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  This happens to be one of my favorite shows.  I'm going to listen and learn. 
[01:55:30]  I learned that from my ride home.  I'm going to wear the pants because I think that your show's so funny.  I'm going to peen myself every day.  Another goal we have.  Everybody wetting their pants on their drive home.  That's a dumb.  Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?  1027 WNEW.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Ouch. 
[01:56:00]  Ouch.  Ouch.  Ouch.  I've got to tighten that up.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Ouch.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Use it or lose it.  That's right, buddy.  We're trying.  Phone line 212-757-1027.  Maybe our own spaz can build a relationship with our boss by going out and drinking beer 
[01:56:30]  and plead our case.  And it can smooth things over?  Sure.  That's what I'll do.  I could do that.  I could do that.  Scott asked for Mawa.  That's interesting instant feedback.  I don't know if this is true.  Maybe you know it.  Anthony, last night the Australian crocodile man did a show from the delivery room while  his wife was giving birth.  Yeah, how about this guy?  Is this real?  Yeah. 
[01:57:00]  Supposedly, he named the baby after his favorite crocodile.  It was effing hilarious.  Yeah.  He's the biggest tool.  They didn't show the vag, though.  No, they had the over-the-shoulder shot.  But they did show the wife sweating and close-ups of him saying how beautiful it was later, Scott.  Breathe, baby.  Breathe.  Is this really true?  Yeah.  He had it live on his little TV show that he does where he's usually wrestling alligators  and being bitten in the face by various Australian outback creatures.  Yeah.  No, he was, you know, push, baby, push.  Look at that little bugger. 
[01:57:30]  He's gorgeous.  Look at the doctors reaching in my wife's privates.  Look at that, Doc.  Both hands in there, right?  Now, Doc, try to clap.  You can't, can you?  Tied, huh?  That old gag.  You gotta watch.  It's got teeth just like a gator.  All right, Doc, look, she's, oh, she's thrashing about. 
[01:58:00]  I'll try to sit on her head.  She's going into a death row.  She can be quite tricky.  It's a custom here in Australia to eat the afterbirth.  Mmm, yummy.  Like a Vegemite sandwich.  Yeah, he did that.  No kidding. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah, this guy seems to me like he'll do anything just to get some people watching his show.  Look at me wife's gear.  Hey, I saw another guy on Animal Planet.  Yeah.  He jumps right into the swamps with the alligators to try to catch him.  Yeah, nuts.  Have you seen that guy?  There's a few people that are trying to, they're ripping him off.  He's like the biggest redneck.  Yeah.  And he jumps into the swamp, up to, I mean, up to his, like, nips.  Yeah.  And he's hunting, and he sees an alligator and he goes for it.  Crazy.  You know what the funniest thing I ever saw was? 
[01:59:00]  Was the guy that put his head in the alligator's mouth.  You ever see that video?  From India?  Yeah, he used to do this all the time.  He'd open up the alligator's mouth, stick his head in, and pull his head out for, like,  a little carnival act or something.  And this one time, a bead of sweat rolled off his head and hit the alligator's tongue,  and the alligator's like, oh, dinner.  That's all it takes.  Clamped down on this guy's head.  He's, like, squealing and trying to get his head out.  And the alligator's just, you know, ho-dee-doo. 
[01:59:30]  I got his head, and I don't care.  I'm laughing my ass off.  Other people's pain is so funny.  It's funny because I don't know him.  It's funny because I don't know him.  It's funny because it's far away.  I love those homo-likes.  It's true.  It's so true.  Mike, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  What's up, man?  You're on the air.  Let's go.  I saw this last night.  Yeah?  Freaking hilarious.  This guy is such a tool. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah, he had his wife giving birth.  He was really in the delivery room.  That's amazing.  And he had the enthusiasm like he was on TV.  Oh, it's a boy.  It's a boy.  Look at him.  Look at the little wiener.  That's how we tell it's a boy.  Look, he's trying to bite me.  Over and out, Diamondbacks.  All right.  To keep the baby quiet, I'm going to put a burlap sack over his head and rope it down  until we get him back to the compound.  Greg, what's going on?  What's going on, guys? 
[02:00:30]  How are you?  I'm just calling up to defend the croc hunter here.  All right.  We love the croc hunter.  You got to love him.  And I do admit that he might have gone a little overboard when he was recording his wife's  birth.  But you got to respect the guy that gets that excited about everything.  What company does the crocodile have to work for?  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  This just in.  The crocodile hunter is owned by CBS.  He's a real man's man.  Who else do you know that could jump in swamps and wrestle snakes and alligators and everything?  The guy is sick.  I saw the guy jump off the fender of a car to try to catch some kind of gazelle or something. 
[02:01:00]  Like they were trying to get him with a rope.  Yeah.  And he's swinging the lariat from the hood of this Land Rover.  And then he throws it and misses.  And like the rope goes under the tire.  So he lets go.  So he's just going, well, get closer, honey.  Get closer to him.  And he just flings himself onto this thing at like 40 miles an hour.  Did you ever see the one where he was roping kangaroos?  No.  No.  On the side of his truck.  And his wife was driving him and slammed him into a tree.  And he goes flying off the truck and his ear was splitting half. 
[02:01:30]  He's like, look, I split my ear.  There's blood all over me.  When he found the snake den in the hole in the rock.  Yeah, right.  It was no bigger than his shoulders.  Just reaches his hand in and starts grabbing the snake in.  The whole face.  He squeezed it.  Hey, shut the.  Shut up, sir.  He squeezed his whole face in there.  The snake comes slithering up and just starts biting him in the nose and the cheek and all  over his face.  And he's just like, well, no, it's okay.  I understand.  He's a little angry. 
[02:02:00]  He's scared.  If I saw a big bugger poking into my house, I'd be a little perturbed.  And he's just letting the snake wham, wham, wham.  He's slamming his face.  He's got fang marks all over him.  Isn't he gorgeous?  Imagine those two in bed.  The crocodile hunter and his wife.  Must be a freaking circus scene, huh?  Oh, brother.  Let's go to Michael.  Michael, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Great. 
[02:02:30]  Two things on the show last night that you guys had mentioned.  One, it was a girl.  And if you saw the look of terror on his face when he realized his new baby was a girl,  he was like, oh, no.  It was unbelievable.  The other thing, did you see, after he, like, caught the baby, he was hunched down like  a football player, and he took the snap.  He had blood all over his hands, and he was shaking, like all his camera crew and the  doctors congratulating him and stuff.  Absolutely sick.  And he was shaking hands on them.  He was shaking hands with the blood and the sinew and all that stuff dripping off. 
[02:03:00]  I'm bummed I missed this last night.  It was unbelievable.  I was watching Jesus last night.  Jesus?  Oh, that sounds like fun.  What, one of those religious Easter movies?  Jesus was all over the tube last night.  Yeah.  All right, Michael.  All right, thanks, man.  Thank you.  Bye.  I can't get away from that religious programming on Easter Sunday, can't they pull all those  movies out?  Jimmy.  Jimmy!  Hey, what's up, R&A?  Love the show, brother.  Hey, Jimmy. 
[02:03:30]  Thank you, brother.  Hey, CJ.  Hey, brother.  Thank you.  You guys ever see the show where he's crying?  Like, he's finding all the lizards burnt, and he's like, he gets out of the car in the  middle of the road, and the snake is all burnt, and he's crying.  Look at the little bugger.  Yeah, he gets real emotional, and he sees the dead animals.  Yeah, it was like a two-inch snake, and he's like, oh, look at the little bugger.  He's all upset like it's this kid in the street.  The best episode was when he was going after the sharks, and instead of getting in a scuba  suit and, like, a wetsuit, he just put the tanks on, the mask and the fins, and still 
[02:04:00]  was wearing his shorts and his, like, Outback-style outfit, and he was swimming with the sharks  with his little outfit on, and his hands all cut.  There's blood in the water.  Should have the sharks cruising any time.  He's nuts.  I'm waiting for something to just bite his head off.  Just a big, oh, look at the big bear.  And just, like, bite his head off.  He took me head off, but I'm okay.  Mike, what's up? 
[02:04:30]  Mike.  Yo.  You're on the air.  Let's go, Mike.  You see the one where his old lady falls in the river?  Yeah, I've seen that one.  He's got that croc, and he comes up, and he says, oh, look, he just got that big pig.  And then they hit a branch or something, and she falls in.  Yeah.  Yeah, they had these.  They would get these huge pigs and use them for bait for the crocs.  And the crocodiles that would come up were so friggin' big.  There was one that had to be, like, 20 feet long.  Big, big, big one.  Yeah, that was 15-footer.  And he gets his wife to sit on the thing's head while he tries to roll it over and tie it up. 
[02:05:00]  And the wife couldn't.  She really was almost going to get eaten because she couldn't handle it.  The things like whipping around, and he had to come up to the front end.  Funny as hell, though.  Come on, grab him.  Grab him like it's me genitals.  Don't let go.  Yeah, you're used to dealing with a monster.  Yeah.  Let's go to Brian.  What's up, Brian?  Hey, did you see the one when he called the shark the wolygogos? 
[02:05:30]  The what?  Wolygogos.  They had all these names for all the, you know, things around the reef.  These little sharks, they were, like, about two feet long.  They had, like, flat heads.  That's funny.  And he goes, they're okay, as long as you don't stick your hand in there.  And, of course, he sticks his hand in there.  Yeah, I know.  It takes off, like, three fingers, and he goes, whoa, look at that.  That's one of those shows when it's on, though, you've got to watch.  Yeah.  You've got to stop for a little while.  All right.  You see the boat?  They've got, like, a 12-foot aluminum boat.  What kind of budget does the guy have? 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, really.  He's got the worst crap that he works with.  He's got, like, a six-horse motor.  His wife, oh, steer over here.  All right, Brian.  Love the show.  Thank you.  We can start singing into what did we learn on the show today, I'm sure.  Sure.  I think we've talked about the crocodile guy.  Oh, yeah.  John Skinny from Jersey.  Sure.  What I learned on the O&A show today, being a Jew, all we get on our 13th birthday is a lame bar mitzvah party,  but if you're Italian, you get a whore. 
[02:06:30]  Whores, horses, guns, whiskey.  Birthday of champions.  Thanks, Dad.  Thank you.  Cindy.  I'll be in Anthony.  Hi, Cindy.  How are you?  Hi.  How's Jan, Marsha?  Good?  Oh, they're super.  She did the list.  That's okay.  Very good.  I had a comment about the crocodile guy.  Okay.  Well, because of you guys, I got totally hooked on it, and I was watching it last night,  and I found out he named his daughter after a baby crocodile and the dog. 
[02:07:00]  Oh, really?  The baby's first name is whatever you call a baby crocodile, and the middle name is Sue,  because the dog's name is Suey.  Suey.  He's out of his frigging mind.  I know, and he even explained that like it was okay.  Like it's okay, yeah.  So, we love you guys, too.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  Baby talk, baby talk.  It's a wonder you can walk.  You shut up, Buddy Hinton.  Thank you.  Okay, brother.  Ouch.  Okay, brother. 
[02:07:30]  Ouch.  Wait, I can't do that.  Okay, brother.  Ouch.  I love Jimmy Superfly Snooker.  He's our fave.  Ouch.  Yeah.  Okay, brother.  What are you people on?  Oh, you want to play the Jimmy Superfly Snooker? 
[02:08:00]  Sure, we can do that.  Yeah, where is he?  As they're lining up the phones for what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show today,  this is the Jimmy Superfly Snooker.  All he had to say was, hi.  Well, wait a minute.  First, do we have an example of somebody who cuts a promo for us that goes flawless?  Yeah.  Just sounds good the way it's supposed to go.  Whenever we have anybody in here of any notoriety, we'd like them to do a little promotion for the show.  Louis Black.  Okay, Louis.  Took him one take.  Here it is.  Hi, this is Louis Black from The Daily Show. 
[02:08:30]  And you're listening to two of the most psychotic human beings I've ever met.  My pals, Opie and Anthony on 102.7 WNEW.  He improvised.  Had a slight problem with 102.7.  Slight.  That's okay, but he went right through it.  Right through it.  One take.  A little improvising.  Very good.  Right.  Okay, this is Jimmy Superfly Snooker from a week ago.  This was three minutes long.  It's down to a minute 20.  Okay, Opie and Anthony on 1.2.7. 
[02:09:00]  Ouch!  I need to.  Mm-hmm.  Opie and Anthony on 1.0.2.7.  Well, this is the Superfly Jimmy Snooker, and you are listening to Opie and Anthony on 1.0.2.7 on WNEW. 
[02:09:30]  Right again, 1.0.2.7?  1.0.2.7.  Yeah, we call it 1.0.2.7.  Okay, 1.0.2.7 on WNEW.  Do you want to say his name instead of first?  You want to say anything?  Hey, this is Jimmy Superfly Snooker.  One more time, and I'll edit that in.  Ouch!  It's the Superfly Jimmy Snooker, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony on 1.0.2.7. 
[02:10:00]  Opie and Anthony on 1.0.2.7 WNEW.  Superfly Jimmy Snooker on your radio doll.  Do you use your tongue prettier?  Do you use your tongue prettier than a $20 whore?  And it ends with this, and you missed it.  Okay, brother.  Okay, brother.  Ouch!  That's our favorite celebrity ID, though. 
[02:10:30]  It's our favorite.  That's a good one.  Just to give you an idea, we did Filter last week.  It's just not as exciting when you hear it like this.  Hey, what's up?  This is Gino.  And this is Richard, and we're from the band Filter.  And you're listening to our friends Opie and Anthony on 1.0.2.7 WNEW.  Hey, look at that.  That's perfect.  Picture perfect.  All right, Ant, let's get to a quick round of what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show today.  Right.  Okay.  Let's start with Lenny from Brooklyn.  I learned that for great limo service, I should call 516. 
[02:11:00]  I love the obscure references.  Most people look at their radio when we read an obscure one and just go, what?  Huh?  But someone out there got that.  Of course.  I had a whole discussion with some guy at your gig Saturday night about how I love the obscure references when they're made on this show.  It shows people that are listening.  Stinky from Princeton, I learned that your boss is Ross Perot.  Pretty close.  Not from it. 
[02:11:30]  All right, let's go to the phones here.  Hey, Jason, what did you learn on the show today?  What's up, guys?  I learned that sometimes Opie and Anthony like to use some keg and get them in some trouble.  Thank you, Jason.  Syndication, whatever.  Yeah, sure.  P, what's up?  Yo, ONA.  Yeah.  Yo, I learned that no matter how much I look, I can't find Ivan in the afternoon on the radio.  Yo, fellas.  I got to dump out of that.  You can't find Ivan in the afternoon.  You can't find Ivan in the afternoon. 
[02:12:00]  A smash hit afternoon show, Ivan in the afternoon.  In case the bosses are still listening, I took it upon myself to dump out of a mention of someone that works for the company.  Why?  Why?  Shut up.  Let's go to Joe.  Joe, what's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What did I learn today on the Opie and Anthony show?  Never talk about your nasty swamp lip.  That's true.  Thank you.  That would be appreciated.  And never talk about Jennifer. 
[02:12:30]  Hey, thanks.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, please.  That's an obscure reference.  Tom, what's up?  It certainly is.  Hey.  Hey, I learned we have a new sound wave now that is going to sweep the nation.  Okay, brother.  We love okay, brother.  And also, I also learned, I can't listen, you can't mention, I'll find this in the corning.  That's right.  Okay.  Later, guys.  Bye.  KYK from Queens, I learned that Hooked on Phonics drops Superfly as their sponsor. 
[02:13:00]  Scott, I learned the words to Ain't Talking About Love.  It's true.  I learned that Superfly Jimmy is like Timmy on South Park.  The only thing he can say clearly is his name.  Timmy.  Okay, brother.  Ouch.  There's like freaking eight-year-olds in here. 
[02:13:30]  All right, a few more here.  Mike, you're next on N.E.W.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up?  I learned never to mess with anybody else's weed in the middle of the woods.  Very good.  That's true.  You guys suck.  All right, thank you.  Some innocent man will get...  Pip-head, guys.  Pip-head.  Pip-head.  Mike, if you want a comic, Mike.  Later, guys.  All right, so let's go to Frank.  Frank, you're next.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I learned that even during a tense political crisis like the Alien Gonzalez case, there's  still time to check out hot Cuban games. 
[02:14:00]  Hey, I learned one more thing.  Can I say that one?  The cousin has those Hummer lips.  Oh, my God.  I did learn something else.  Can I go with that?  Yeah.  I also learned that you guys have the power to turn me into an S&M freak between Bridget's  waxing and Friday's hot wax.  The hot wax.  Yeah.  That's awesome.  We've got to get more girls in to do that.  I never thought anything like that would be hot, but it kind of worked out that way.  Oh, me too, Ann.  I was never into that, and now I'm totally into it.  Yeah.  Well, we've got a few more girls down for that.  All right, guys.  Now you know it, you'll be into chopping up girls and burying them in the woods.  Stuck tape and a spade shovel.  Edith from California. 
[02:14:30]  Might be getting the show illegally on the Internet.  A few of those people checking in lately.  Put your tongue in it, don't you?  Ah.  I learned that it's not okay to ask for a Hummer from a co-worker.  That's true.  Let's go to Paul.  Paul, you're next on NEW.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  Hey, Ann, I learned someone stuck their tongue in your rear.  No, they were trying to stick their tongue in his rear. 
[02:15:00]  In my ear.  Not rear.  See, it doesn't work when you word it like that, Opie.  In, yeah, in the rear.  No.  In the ear.  In the ear.  In the ear.  In your rear?  In your, oh, I got it.  I got it.  Okay, I'm sorry.  I spit up the whole book.  In your ear.  Right, okay.  In your ear.  In your ear.  All right, guys.  In the tangent, who gives a crap?  All right.  See you.  That's the one I like now.  Syndication, who gives a crap?  Right.  It only works if you have the word your ear.  Your ear.  Right.  It's your ear.  I got you now. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah, what's the matter?  Someone tried to stick their tongue in his ear?  How come it's not funny when I do it?  Hey, someone tried to put his tongue in Anthony's ear.  See?  Me.  And I got another very good obscure one.  Okay.  Anthony from Medicine, New Jersey.  I learned if you give Superfly a flute, he could be Gray Wolf.  Yeah.  That is very good.  Ouch.  Do we have any Gray Wolf audio?  Okay, brother. 
[02:16:00]  Ouch.  Okay, brother.  Brother.  Brother.  Ouch.  And let's go to Sean.  We're just about out of here.  We got to step aside from Dynamike.  Sean, what's up?  What's up, fellas?  Listen, I learned a new I.N.S. motto.  Yeah.  Drop the chalupa.  Take care, fellas.  Have a good day.  All right, Sean.  Bye.  Unhand the boy.  Unhand the boy.  Oh, dear.  All right.  Let's get a little on you.  There's some great ones on the phones, but we have to step aside here. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah.  And we had a lot of fun today, huh?  Certainly did.  Nice for a Monday.  Yes.  I'm feeling good.  Yes.  All right.  Say a prayer.  Ratings come out tomorrow.  Oh, that's right.  Hey.  Ouch.  Maybe the only thing that saves our asses.  Yeah.  Hit or miss, isn't it?  We just hinge there every three months.  Ouch.  That's right, Jimmy.  Ratings tomorrow.  We'll see everyone at two tomorrow, right? 
[02:17:00]  Maybe.  Ouch.  Okay, brother.  Give me your rules.  We've got to get him back on the show.  See where it went wrong.  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, man, thanks.  Okay, brother.  We're looking for a few good enemas.  What the hell are you talking about?  The Sophie and Anthony Show. 
[02:17:30]  Crap, whiz, and vomit.  1027-WAW. </pre>
