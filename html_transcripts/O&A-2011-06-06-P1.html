<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with an unexpected introduction by Larry King, setting a bizarre tone for the broadcast.  The hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, discussed their sleep deprivation, a new favorite custard pastry shop, and their recent Twitter spats regarding LeBron James and the NBA playoffs.  This segued into a discussion about racial differences in Twitter usage, followed by Anthony recounting a humorous story about a penis-shaped drawing on a parked car.

Opie then detailed a trip to a gun range, describing his firearms and targets (including Osama Bin Laden, a stereotypical Arab, and a stereotypical 90s Black gangster), noting the awkwardness of shooting the Black target while a Black man was present.  The conversation then shifted to Plexico Burress's imprisonment, their disdain for Mayor Bloomberg's anti-gun stance, and complaints about the traffic caused by the Israeli Day parade. Opie recounted aggressively navigating this traffic to reach his nephew's baseball game, leading to a broader discussion of New York City traffic compared to Los Angeles and Connecticut.  They played an old audio clip from their "Get Your Ass Off the Couch and Go Do Something Report" from their Boston days, featuring altered voices. The segment ended with Opie's account of a bizarre near-accident on the Cross County Parkway involving a series of brake checks.

A caller then described a chaotic incident on the Cross County Parkway involving a large group of young Hispanic people drag racing, blocking traffic, and creating dangerous situations.  Another caller, Marcos, clarified this as a form of organized drag racing.  This sparked a discussion about similar events, including Oakland sideshows, and the lack of media attention to race and ethnicity in relation to flash mob robberies and violence.  The conversation then veered into a discussion of "The Book of Mormon," followed by numerous sexually suggestive anecdotes from the hosts' past involving encounters with women at various clubs, restaurants, and on tour, including a missed skinny-dipping opportunity with "Kahlua Girls," and an incident involving underage girls on a rock band's tour bus.  A memorable encounter at Quality Meats involving a person with a severe facial deformity was also recounted. Jim Norton's upcoming role in an FBI agent comedy film was briefly mentioned.

This led into a further exploration of past sexual encounters and near-misses, often involving graphic descriptions and highly offensive language.  Multiple anecdotes featured women, some underage, including the missed opportunity with the Kahlua girls, an incident with a woman on a host's shoulders outside the station, and a visit to a sorority house involving keg stands.  They discussed regret for not pursuing these opportunities, attributing their inaction to fear of repercussions from their wives.  The conversation touched upon a past negative TV news segment about the show and Anthony Weiner's sexting scandal, with speculation about the explicit content. A parody of Andy Rooney and a call about "man boobs" were included. The segment concluded with plans for a paintball event.

The show then transitioned to a discussion of Jesse Jackson's controversial comments, including a racial slur and a violent statement.  They briefly mentioned a previous studio visit from Debbie Gibson and Tiffany, before focusing on transcripts from flight recorders, specifically the Air France crash and a July 4th, 2001 crash.  The hosts described these transcripts as "short horror stories," highlighting the mundane pre-crash conversations.  A flight instructor, Mike, called in to provide context about air crew coordination and the dangers of pilot error and instrument failure.

This led to an interview with Dan Weldon, the Indy 500 winner.  The conversation encompassed Weldon's win, the crash that led to it, the risks of racing, racing strategies, the intense competition, car speed, safety features, pit stops, the physical demands on drivers, sponsorships, and future plans.  The hosts incorporated jokes about cologne, urinating in the car, and sexually suggestive comments referencing Danica Patrick and Debbie Gibson.  The interview covered technical details, such as tire changes, driving in wet conditions, sensations of high-speed driving, incidents with other drivers (including Weldon giving another driver the middle finger), the lack of distractions during a race, the open-cockpit design, tear-offs on helmets, and the post-race milk tradition (with a humorous suggestion of breast milk). Weldon mentioned upcoming races at Texas Motor Speedway and his sponsor, William Rast.  The segment concluded with a mention of Sugar Ray Leonard and Florentino as the next day's guests and a giveaway of Duke Nukem video games.  The interview with Dan Weldon was also partly covered earlier in the broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hi, this is Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  What the hell am I doing here?  Isn't it brilliant?  Forget it. The thing's out of control. Out of control.  Great guests, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It gets my nipples hard, you know what I mean, son?  Are you out of your mind?  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to intro it.  Oh, you're going to have a ball. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, you're good.  Let's welcome our hosts, Opie and Anthony.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  That's pretty good.  That's awesome. Thank you, Larry King.  I haven't heard that.  Well, that's a drop-off.  Larry King used to host his own show, and now he's introing our radio show.  Ouch.  Introing this drivel.  Ouch.  Morning.  Morning, everybody.  Good morning.  How's everybody doing? 
[00:01:00]  Good morning, everybody.  How's everybody doing?  Monday morning.  I didn't sleep well at all.  Oh, Jimmy.  No, no, no, no, no.  We did that show already.  Oh, that one.  Very sleepy.  No, we did that already.  Oh, Jimmy.  No, no, no.  You were supposed to get sleep.  I tried.  We can only have one of those shows every once in a while, or it just gets really annoying.  Did you have sleepy troubles?  I really did again.  I would say it was probably three-something before I finally got to sleep.  Ouch.  I tried.  Three-something was just a mere hour ago.  Two hours ago. 
[00:01:30]  Two hours ago.  Whatever.  Yeah, wow.  Damn.  Are you drinking coffee too late?  No.  Are you having little treats late?  I did have a little treat yesterday, but not much.  I think I slept.  Yeah, Mondays are always bad days for me, because I think I had whipped cream last night, but  it's sugar-free, because that wouldn't keep me up.  We discovered this place, this custard, puff, pastry place.  That sounds fattening. 
[00:02:00]  I was coming back from Long Island, and my wife had stuff to do in the city yesterday, and  she was walking by the place.  Yeah.  And she's like, do you want me to get you one?  I'm like, I had to beg her, do not get me one.  What is it?  It's just this place of just ridiculous goodness.  Custard creamy deliciousness and some cakey stuff.  It's just, it's some kind of a puff, but you can get a chocolate puff that just breaks  when you put it in your mouth, it just all breaks apart, and then in the middle is the 
[00:02:30]  best custard you've ever had in your life.  And I'm not necessarily a custard guy.  But goodness.  And I'm really mad that we discovered this place.  Where is it?  It's in the 70s, and kind of like either Broadway or Amsterdam.  I always get those two confused as far as where shit is.  So, it's unbelievable.  I might have to bring some in here, so you guys could try these out.  I don't like eating stuff that's delicious.  This thing is ridiculous, because you choose your puff, or your shell, I guess they call 
[00:03:00]  it.  Your puff.  And there's all kinds.  I tried the chocolate one, then they got the regular one, then they get really crazy  and fancy, then they shove this thing in, and fresh custard.  It's always a gimmick.  Oh, yeah.  The places all have gimmicks.  Yeah, this is a...  You choose your own.  It's like choosing a ring setting, and then the diamond.  Yeah, exactly.  You choose your shell first, and then you can choose what kind of custard you want inside,  too.  Yeah.  What kind of options are there?  I don't know.  My guy just stands there jerking off all day, shoving his dick in there. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  All right.  You want a little hepsy?  We're four minutes in.  I have...  What am I doing?  I have absolutely no self-control.  So, when we discovered the place, I didn't even want to walk up to the counter.  Yeah.  I figured the less I know about the place, the better off I'll be.  And then she came back with this chocolate thing with the custard inside.  I'm like, fuck.  It's delicious.  It's really ridiculous.  I'm curious now as to what custard options are.  All right.  I'll go back.  I bet vanilla is really good.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:04:00]  That's some kind of banana thing, too.  I believe so.  Banana cream.  I believe so.  Anything banana-y is great.  You want to go now?  No, I really do.  I mean...  You want to go now?  I had a big dessert the other night.  Like, I can't.  You want me to bring some in tomorrow?  I mean, yes and no.  I mean...  I'll have to.  Will they keep overnight?  I think they will.  Probably not.  Probably not as good as that fresh fucking injected cream.  Well, there's another place on Columbus.  It's little Italian donuts that are filled with shit. 
[00:04:30]  Don't fuck it.  This city's weird.  That place is called Bombolino or something like that.  Look it up.  It's...  Yeah, yeah.  That's ridiculous.  Yeah, good shit.  With fresh gelato.  You want some gelato?  See, that's my...  My problem is I could eat...  I could eat well...  Actually, I could eat almost perfectly all day long.  Yeah.  And then that dessert gets me every fucking time.  And around the city.  Then I just ruin it with the calories from fucking dessert.  Salads all day, oatmeal in the morning, all this crap. 
[00:05:00]  And then I'll sit in front of the TV and watch, you know, the NBA playoffs or something and eat a half gallon of ice cream.  Like, what the fuck's wrong with you?  See, that's what fat people do.  Yeah.  It's hard not to.  It's like I said, delicious stuff.  Delicious.  It's delicious.  You got to stay away.  Stupid Dirk for the people that didn't stay up.  Fucking missed a buzzer beater.  So now the Miami Heat lead the Mavericks two games to one. 
[00:05:30]  LeBron James is two games away from getting a championship.  Well, that's the way it was supposed to happen, right?  And then people still argue.  Like, the super team, right?  Well, they're still arguing with me on Twitter.  One guy's like, I really need to know why I don't like LeBron so much.  Is it because the way he left?  I go, yes, exactly.  I go, it's the way he left and no class.  So then everyone has to beat the shit out of me.  You know, he raised $2 million for the boys' club by doing it that way.  Who cares? 
[00:06:00]  All I saw was a clip of a monster shoving a ball in a fucking hoop with someone right in front of him.  Yeah, that was, I don't even, yeah.  That was retarded.  And I don't even like basketball, but I watched that and just went like, all right, that guy's got to fucking have something going on.  Yeah, that was LeBron.  I don't know who he took over.  He faced somebody.  Oh, it was ridiculous.  Because the guy was in perfect defensive position.  He really was.  He did exactly what he was supposed to do.  And LeBron just jumped pretty much over his hand. 
[00:06:30]  Over his hand.  And then dunked it by him.  And then sunk.  It was crazy.  So, I don't know.  The Mavs are in deep trouble because Dirk is hurt.  Dirk's got fucked up wrists, fingers.  He's all fucked up.  Is this it?  LeBron James is good to know that Bohemia is down with the king.  And then someone goes, you've got to respect his skills.  Look at this.  I'm like, of course.  He's just right over the guy's fucking hand.  He's a great player.  Of course he is.  He's like, fuck you and your hand. 
[00:07:00]  He's not going to win no championship with the flu, though, like Jordan did.  And I had an argument with the guy with that.  He goes, that was game five.  They had to play another game after that.  I want to write back to the guy.  Yeah, he still probably had the flu, though.  You don't have the flu for one day.  Yeah.  That was your Twitter argument?  Because I had to give up last night.  Really?  Yeah, I gave up.  I was battling with just basketball fans.  That's all.  Yeah.  I don't even know that much anymore. 
[00:07:30]  I used to know it all.  But I realized I couldn't really accurately get a Second Amendment argument going in 140  fucking characters.  No matter how many times I turn Y-O-U into the letter U.  Right.  You know, T-W-O into the number two.  Right.  No matter what.  I could not really get my point across of a huge debate like the Second Amendment in 140.  Can I tell you something?  And then, you know, people go, well, just do TwitLonger. 
[00:08:00]  No one reads anything that is more than 140 characters.  You can't do it.  Every once in a while, I'll do it.  If I get lazy retweeting somebody else and I want a little comment, I'll do it.  I never click on a link in someone's Twitter for a TwitLonger.  You know what I mean?  No, no.  I'll click on links that somebody has.  It's like, hey, you know, check this article out or something.  And I'll click on that and look at that shit.  But I won't go to a TwitLonger because that defeats the purpose.  I mean, I obviously love Twitter, but it's obvious when you tweet, maybe 10% of your followers read your shit. 
[00:08:30]  Maybe.  I think it's less than 10%.  So then on top of that, you've got to TwitLonger.  Now you're cutting down your 10% to probably 3%.  They're not reading.  You know?  And then when you're going back and forth with somebody, you have to add in their point and their name.  And now you only get a few letters to fucking give you a response.  So I was just like, I can't. 
[00:09:00]  I was like, good night.  I know you don't like them that much, but you've got to follow the lead of the blacks.  The blacks know how to tweet.  What are they doing?  They got all sorts of shit going on.  Abbreviations and...  Abbreviations, yo?  They come up with new words.  You ever follow a trending topic that's a very black topic?  No.  Holy...  I don't know...  I was going to say something that would have just got me in trouble.  I do have a filter, people. 
[00:09:30]  Even though it doesn't seem like I do it.  I was...  It was...  That word was on my molars.  Really?  Yeah.  But they pretty much are coming up with a whole new language for Twitter.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not just...  Not regular black slang that we sort of are aware of.  They're coming up with a whole new thing with Twitter, too.  See, that's a good thing to do.  Like, just kind of...  They could get some shit done in 140 characters.  What, are they pulling vowels out?  Yeah.  Yeah, you just pull vowels out?  Yeah, they pull the vowels out.  They need no goddamn vowels. 
[00:10:00]  Numbers.  They also...  Black people have a higher percentage of blacks on Twitter than whites.  I think so.  It absolutely is.  Yeah?  Why is that?  I don't know.  I forget the...  I forget the percentage, but I want to say white people...  That's probably right.  4% or 5%.  I know they're four times more likely to check Twitter during the day than white people.  There was a big study, though, and I don't...  Yeah.  13% of white people and, like, 20% of blacks, I think, might be it. 
[00:10:30]  I believe that.  Wow.  Oh.  The fact is, even though we're all about it, still probably a very tiny percent of our audience  even has Twitter.  Twits Twitter.  An extremely small percent.  Yeah.  I think they...  I think if you're a fan of the show, you should get Twitter, because we're all doing shit  outside the show.  That's kind of cool, man.  The second we leave here, it's just...  All of us are doing separate shit and different weird shit on Twitter.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:11:00]  It definitely keeps the show vibe going.  For example, last night I was leaving FH Riley's.  I was telling Anthony...  Where is that?  The Heart of Huntington Village.  Ah, right.  Trust me.  My brother doesn't need any help anymore.  I do want to thank the listeners, because if it wasn't for the listeners, he probably  wouldn't have survived, because it's really tough to get a new restaurant off the ground.  And I was talking about this last night.  The listeners were the ones that kept that place going for the first year.  Yeah.  And now it's just what he does with the food and...  Now he throws him out.  Yeah.  Get out of here. 
[00:11:30]  Get the hell out of here.  We have a class restaurant going now.  We don't need the likes of you.  So he won't let you in unless you say Baba Booey at the door.  But honestly, they're the ones that really got the damn thing off the ground, and I'll never  forget that.  My brother will never forget that.  But now it's about the reputation of the food and everything.  I mean, it's the place to be in Huntington.  It's unbelievable.  Fucking pasta sundae.  The place is packed.  But I'm coming home, and I tweet a picture of this car with a nice, big, huge, fucking  hairy dick on it. 
[00:12:00]  What?  That never gets old.  A big, hairy dick?  Big...  I mean, a large, hairy...  What was it written in?  It almost looked like it was in lipstick.  So someone was...  Someone fucked him over.  Where is it?  I'll find it really fast.  Yeah, was it Damone's car?  Did it say little prick on the side?  Yeah, right?  Hey, thanks.  We were talking about Fast Times yesterday as well.  Once again.  Yeah, here.  The classic, huge dick on the side of the window. 
[00:12:30]  It's up the window.  It takes up the back and the side window.  And this dick is coming, if you look closely.  Oh, right, right.  It's coming.  It's a big, huge, pink dick.  The balls start in the passenger window, and the head of the penis is all the way in the  front window there.  Yeah, that's...  Did I say that right?  No.  I mean, the back window to the front window.  All right, whatever.  Yeah, it takes up the whole side of the car.  Isn't that great?  Wow, that's...  Just parked on the street in Huntington. 
[00:13:00]  Universal symbol of the cock, right there.  I would imagine someone had a really late night, and they probably were crashing all day  Sunday, and they have no idea they got a huge pink dick on the side of their car  yet.  That's why you gotta follow us on Twitter.  I gotta see the big pink dicks.  Yeah, all this shit is happening after the show, but...  Yeah, I had a...  I went to the range and took some video with my hat cam.  My hat cam.  Yeah.  And that was fun, you know, just blasting some shit off.  But then that's what started the whole Twitter war thing. 
[00:13:30]  With the Second Amendment.  Yeah, you go on there, and people are like, what?  Because some big, fat pig woman is like, ah, what's with you and the guns?  We all know it, you're making up for a small dick.  Like, really?  Is that what it is?  Fatty?  And I was just like, you look like you smell, and I was just, you know, nice, immature shit  I was getting at.  Right.  But it's like, and then people just start like, you know, what's your problem? 
[00:14:00]  How far?  Should we be allowed to have missiles?  It's like, I can't do this.  I just can't.  So I just bailed.  The small dick argument is so stupid, because when you tweeted that picture of all the guns  that you were taking to the range, I don't think I got a semi.  It's like, and I'm not a gun guy, but I'm like, that would be fucking cool to do.  Get your little bag, your guns, you go out there and you blast some shit.  It has nothing to do with your dick.  It has something to do with it.  It's just fun. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  I had all my targets.  That was another thing.  I fucking, and this shows, I don't know, I don't know why I reacted like this, but I did.  I took a few targets down there.  You know, your standard Bin Laden zombie target now, because Bin Laden's dead.  Now I got Bin Laden zombie targets.  Right.  And then there was one of some Arab guy.  There's the picture I was talking about.  That's the fucking haul that I took down to the range.  You took all those to the range?  Yeah, I took them all.  One, two, three, four, five, six guns? 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, just blasting away.  Six guns.  It was fun.  Six assault rifles?  One AR-15, a submachine gun, and the rest were pistols.  Wow.  What's your favorite gun out of all those?  They're all so different.  I know.  They're all my children.  That's why it makes them.  You can't pick one of your favorite children.  Oh, really?  That's my favorite rifle I have.  My favorite AR is that one.  Yeah.  But as far as the pistols go, the Wilson Combat 45, I like that. 
[00:15:30]  It's small, .45 caliber.  But then I also, you know, the Desert Eagle.  I can't pick.  That's why I took them all, because they're just so much fun.  I love it.  You don't say how many.  I have a lot.  Can you write it down?  I really need to know.  I don't even know it at this point.  I'd have to count my head.  Is it?  It's more than, yeah, it's, no, no, no, no.  Not 50.  Well, I'm not, you don't have to tell, you don't, I don't know.  It's probably in the, it's in the 20s somewhere. 
[00:16:00]  Jesus.  Not that many, but.  So I go to the range.  I have all these targets that I got, and they're fun, fun targets, you know, A-Rabs and shit  like that.  And then I have one target of a homie.  It's like a homie.  He looked like Eazy-E.  And he's over a car hood with a pistol point.  I'm like, all right.  So I go to the range, and the woman goes, you know, okay, range two, slot C.  I'm like, okay.  They're going to range two, slot C. 
[00:16:30]  There's one other guy in there, an A, and it's a black guy.  And I'm like, god damn, you know, I.  You can't use your target.  But I can.  There's no reason I can't, maybe not first target, but I put up my zombie bin Laden target,  right?  And I'm blasting away at it.  And he actually came over, and he goes, damn, that's a great target.  Well, you're not going to like the second one.  That's all I'm thinking is, well, you ain't going to like the next one.  When are you leaving?  Because I got a second target.  Yeah. 
[00:17:00]  So I ran through all of my targets, all of my bin Laden, and then I had one that looked  like Bob Kelly with a gun and a fucking wool hat, another one that looked like he just came  from the gay parade, and an Arab, you know, wearing his headgear and shit.  But I wasn't comfortable wheeling out the black guy target with a black guy in the range,  but that shouldn't make a difference.  It really shouldn't make a difference. 
[00:17:30]  Well, you know, because you already know how you, where it's coming from, and you're afraid  that he will see it.  No, it's just, I really don't feel like, oh, great, a black target, let me shoot at it  like with more zeal, I'm like, it's just another target.  It's because you do shoot at it with more zeal, and it's probably all the stuff you can't  help yourself, where you're shouting out things as you're shooting at this target, and you're  like, well, with this fine gentleman to my left, I can't do this target yet.  I swear I wasn't yelling anything out. 
[00:18:00]  Because with this target, I get very vocal.  I wasn't yelling anything out, I swear.  And I was just chewing up, like, Arab guy targets.  So it's like, what's the difference?  And obviously it was like a 90s black guy.  It looked like he was from fucking NWA or something.  New Jack City.  Yeah, New Jack City.  Definitely.  Boys in the Hood shit. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  But, yeah, but I felt like I couldn't, look at the guy with a mullet.  When did you pull out the black target?  The second he left the, the second he left the range.  Why didn't you talk to the guy a little bit?  Get to know him.  No, well, he was cool.  You guys had something in common.  He was into his own thing.  He liked your target?  I did.  What kind of target did he have?  He probably had a white target.  He's like, when is this honky going to leave so I can use my white target?  I noticed the target he was using because I was, you know, in a bit of turmoil about 
[00:19:00]  my target choice.  He was using the old, meh, meh, see?  The old white guy, mugsy fucking criminal target.  The go-to one.  The go-to with the cigar in his mouth.  We've seen it a million times, right?  The derby.  It looks like any crook from a Bugs Bunny episode.  Meh, meh.  And he's holding his fucking revolver.  That's the guy.  Meh, see?  Meh.  That's what he was shooting at.  Now, he's shooting at a white guy.  That guy's going.  That guy's known.  That guy's going after Al Capone.  Yeah, yeah.  He's one of Al Capone's guys.  He's, meh, see? 
[00:19:30]  Don't ever get me alive, see?  Yeah, never get me a copper.  You lousy screw.  I do enjoy his criminal wear that he's wearing.  He's got, like, Dockers and a members-only jacket.  Members-only jacket, Dockers.  He's got big fucking balls in his pants or something.  Just horrible balls.  He's got his hairy criminal hands that, you know, just touch hookers because he can't  get into a relationship because he's a crook.  He really does have a nice head of hair on that.  Oh, and that good, nice, big head of fucking 50s actor hair. 
[00:20:00]  It's like slicked with greasy hair.  Yeah, so very greasy.  His hair like a Greek.  It's like Gleason's hair.  Jackie Gleason's hair.  All greasy and slicked back.  Damn Greeks have good hair.  They certainly do.  Always.  But he's shooting at that target, the white guy target.  And for some reason, I just felt like, maybe if there were other people in the range, but  it was just me and him.  You should have just went with it.  First target out of the gate?  No, you should have pulled it out and then laughed and said, maybe we should switch.  And then he would have laughed.  Hey, maybe we should switch targets. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, he'd go, oh, what?  The paper for you, motherfucker?  No, that'd be funny, though.  I'll shoot the white guy.  You shoot the black guy.  That would have been funny.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You think?  If you said, hey, maybe we should switch targets.  He did laugh at the bin Laden zombie targets.  But that's the video you gotta make.  Yeah?  You show the black guy, you show your black target, and go, ah, what are you gonna do?  And then you freaking do it.  I didn't want to make him feel uncomfortable.  You know?  No, you didn't want to make you feel uncomfortable.  Yeah.  It's all about your comfort zone.  But the whole vibe would have been a little uncomfortable if I would have pulled it out first. 
[00:21:00]  I should have pulled it out, like, second.  You should have went over there and slapped him, the target, for looking at a white  lady, and then fucking shot him.  You should have said, you should have said, you're lucky it's not you.  Oh, yeah?  I would have gotten, I would have made good will in the range.  I could have had you shot for that.  It just seems like it's a weird double standard thing, but I don't know what the protocol  is if you're shooting at black targets with a black guy in the range, and it's just a 
[00:21:30]  criminal guy.  It's not like, it's not like a black guy that's, you know, walking his kids to school  or something.  It's a black criminal guy, just like Muggsy.  Meh.  Well, next time you gotta go for it.  I'll go for it.  You gotta go for it next time.  You know, speaking of guns, I think I'm gonna go get a gun.  Yeah, huh?  I'm gonna get an illegal one, though, because that paper is a nightmare.  Well, yeah, you just pick one up illegally.  I'm just gonna get an illegal one that I could have in my car.  On that note, Plexico's getting out, I guess, today. 
[00:22:00]  See?  20 months in jail for a...  I could do 20 months.  20 months on your head.  Dude, that makes me so angry that that guy had to go to jail.  Yeah, no kidding.  This is making me angry that Casey Anthony's gonna be going to jail, because I just like  her.  Well, anyway.  It's all because Bloomberg fucking spoke up.  Huh?  If he would have just kept his fucking DSL shut, Plexico...  I heard Morgenthal didn't want to do it, so he probably would have been okay.  Yeah, but he's just...  Bloomberg is anti-guns in the city. 
[00:22:30]  I have such a hatred for Bloomberg.  Mandatory.  And the thing is, Plexico was licensed in Florida, I guess.  But he wasn't aware of the laws that no one can carry in New York City.  Did he do 20 months?  Yeah.  20 months.  That's 20 months?  I know.  It doesn't seem like that long.  He did 20 months.  20 months.  I would have sworn it was less than a year.  So he doesn't have the option Bloomberg does, which is go to the city council and have them  fucking change the rules for you, and then it's not illegal, technically.  Yeah, do that one.  Like running for a third term.  Right.  That's what he does.  Right?  Speaking of Bloomberg, because of Bloomberg, I'm gonna be very, very mad at the Jews for 
[00:23:00]  the next couple of days.  The Jewish council.  Maybe someone could call and try to explain to these guys what a nightmare the city was  yesterday because they had the Israeli parade.  Yeah.  Every weekend in the city, they need a parade for some reason.  I guess it started with the basic parades a long time ago, and then everyone had a bitch  and complain.  That St. Paddy's Day parade, that's a big one.  It's been around since before fucking like the country.  Just march in the St. Paddy's Day parade and be done with it. 
[00:23:30]  Why does everyone have to have a separate parade?  But yesterday was the Israeli parade.  And because, you know, there's a lot of people that want to do harm to the Jews.  Yes.  Usually they shut down Fifth Avenue for the parade.  You know the deal.  Yep.  Right?  It's either Fifth Avenue or Thanksgiving Day parade.  They go up Central Park West and down, what do they do?  I always forget.  Broadway or whatever they do.  Yeah.  But most of the parades are on Fifth Avenue.  And usually when there's a parade, they shut down Fifth Avenue.  So that's kind of a drag and you got to get around somehow the parade route. 
[00:24:00]  But because it was the Israeli Day parade and someone's got to back me up, maybe a cop can,  they closed down entire avenues.  You get more streets or avenues on either side of the parade route because I guess they  didn't want a car bombing or something.  I don't know.  Yeah, something like that.  A fucking suicide bomber.  So you got to squeeze through gates and there's cops all over the place kind of checking people  out.  So Bloomberg thought it made complete sense to do this to keep everyone safe in the Israeli 
[00:24:30]  parade.  And the city was in complete lockdown yesterday.  Grid lock.  Yeah.  Because of a dumb parade.  At that point, don't you tell the people, look, we can only shut down Fifth Avenue if  you want to do your parade.  Great.  If not, that's the best we could do.  But no, they just catered to cater to the yesterday and everyone else had to suffer.  Everyone had to suffer.  They they get their time like everybody else does, like everyone else in the city. 
[00:25:00]  They all get their fucking parade days.  But I had I had to get out to Long Island for my nephew's little baseball game and usually  takes me 15 minutes to get off Manhattan Island and then start my journey.  Yeah, it's not big on the Long Island Expressway yesterday.  Tuesday, an hour and 15 minutes just to fucking start my journey.  Just to get off of Manhattan.  Hour and 15 minutes.  What time did you leave?  Wow.  I left at 12 and I finally got into the tunnel at 115. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, maybe 120.  What time was the game?  Jesus.  Two.  Oh, so you gave yourself plenty of time.  You just want to fucking.  Two hours is fine.  Two hours is fine.  To leave your house.  Oh, yeah.  You gave yourself plenty of time.  I thought I was going to get out there early, maybe go to Starbucks or get a little bite  to eat or something.  Just chill out.  Hell fucking no.  It got to the point where I was I turned into Anthony.  I was doing all sorts of illegal moves, complete illegal moves.  One where the traffic cop gave me the finger back and forth.  Like, I can't.  I never skate past the real NYPD.  Hell no.  Never.  Those fucking fat bitch traffic women that wear the yellow vest. 
[00:26:00]  Right.  I will fucking make a left when they don't want you making a left.  I will left around them.  Yeah, but some of them have real passion and they'll actually get in front of your car.  Oh, they'll get in front of your car and shit.  You want to die for a right turn?  That's why you got to make the surprise move.  That's what I did.  You got to sit there.  Make like you're going to comply.  Don't make eye contact.  Even when I'm like, yeah, I got this.  I know what's going on here.  And then the second that light turns, you got to pick your spot.  Watch which way she's moving.  If she's moving fucking right, you got to go around her left. 
[00:26:30]  Right.  Because they didn't want anyone making.  It's a long story.  And I won't bore you with that.  But at one point I needed to make this left.  Or I was in.  If I didn't make this left, I would not have made the game.  And I would have just went home.  And I really wanted to get out of the city yesterday with my kid.  There are times where if you can't make one turn that you want to make, it's another  hour.  Tack another hour onto your shit.  Exactly.  So you have to make the turn.  And there's people there making it so you're not allowed to make that.  Yeah.  So I'm at this red light and she's letting the cars come in from my right cross in front 
[00:27:00]  of me.  Yeah.  You could go straight.  So obviously this road is open.  But it's an illegal left because they have those dumb bike paths now.  So you're not allowed to cross the bike paths.  Yeah.  But because the whole city was in lockdown with entire streets closed, I'm like, ah,  fucking throw the rules away today.  Yep.  So just like you said, she's like showing everyone you got to go straight here.  And I'm like this all like waving nice.  I got my seatbelt on.  Like, okay, thank you.  Thanks for the info.  Nice lady.  And just like you said, I'm inching up because now I have to, there's a car to my left too. 
[00:27:30]  So not only do I have to make the illegal left, I got to make it from the right side.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a move.  And also in the light changes and she does the, all right, come on, come ahead.  Yeah.  And backs off.  And I gun it in front of this guy and her to make that left.  She was out of her fucking mind.  Oh, I always look in the rear view and they are.  Yeah.  All they could do there was shake their fist.  Why you?  She gave me the finger back and forth like, ah, no, you didn't.  And it's like, yes, I did. 
[00:28:00]  What are you going to do about it?  You know why?  Because she's left standing with the other motorists going, now what are you going to do, fatso?  Right.  What are you going to do about it?  It's almost like in the wire when the security guard had the fucking Marla took the lollipops.  Oh, shit.  That's like the other customers still standing there going, what the fuck are you going to  do?  You saw that?  Yeah.  And everyone knows once you did that and she stood there, she hasn't, she doesn't do a  fucking thing.  Do what you want, fellas.  Right.  If you're going to lock down this city and make it a complete gridlock, then I say throw  the rules away.  I'm serious. 
[00:28:30]  I was making U-turns and all sorts of shit.  You would have been proud yesterday, man.  That's great.  You would have been fucking proud.  That's every day for me.  Did you feel frustrated?  Dude, I went from, I went from, I left my house and, you know, I got a one-year-old  too, man.  I mean, the parents understand this shit.  I timed my trip with his nap.  This is a parent thing.  You guys time it with, I time trips with my nap.  Yeah, exactly.  It's a parent thing, but it makes it a lot easier because, you know, kids get fussy. 
[00:29:00]  So like, all right, it's nap time.  I put him in the fucking car.  He's out cold.  But now I'm on the clock.  I only have a certain amount of time.  How long is his nap?  Could be anywhere from an hour to two hours.  That's like a time bomb.  It is.  It's a time bomb in the back seat.  Time bomb.  So then I pull out.  I'm like, all right.  And then the first road closure, I'm like, all right, I can handle this.  I live in the city.  I know this shit happens.  So I'm not mad yet.  And then when I started seeing road after road after road closing, as they're funneling  everybody, because as soon as there's another road closed, that means more cars funneling, 
[00:29:30]  more cars funneling.  Then it got to a point where every light change, maybe one car was going through.  And now I'm starting to heat up.  And now I start punching things.  Actually, that's why my left hand hurts.  I went to bed last night trying to figure out why my left hand hurts.  I forgot.  I was fucking pounding my left window.  So now you go from punching things because you're out of your mind, beeping horns like  a lunatic because you're just frustrated.  Not that it's going to help anything, but you don't know what else to do.  And then it got to a point when all of this for the locals, when I was down at 23rd Street, 
[00:30:00]  when I usually cross over around around 66, I almost started crying.  Oh, well, you could.  I almost started crying.  I've been in that situation.  I went from this is okay to complete frustration, beating the shit out of myself to I wanted  to cry.  I was almost brought to tears.  This has only happened two, maybe three times since living in the city.  That is literally, by the way.  It's not like a figurative I wanted to cry term.  Literally, you're sitting there and you're like, I, as a grown man, am going to start crying 
[00:30:30]  because I'm so frustrated.  Because, I mean, when you get really mad, that usually helps.  And then usually the traffic opens up.  Like, call me, call me whatever you want.  I don't care.  People understand this.  Oh, it's frustration.  And then it gets to the point that you have no more moves left in you.  Because if you know what you're doing in a car, you'll work some moves.  Yeah.  And then you try some shit. 
[00:31:00]  And when nothing's working, now you're sitting there like, what else?  What can I do?  And you literally want to break down and cry.  Do you know, I've been through that traffic literally where you want.  It is like a childlike desire to weep and be everything made better for you.  But in a way, it's a testament to how good we have it.  Like, that's utter helplessness.  When you're in traffic like that, something has been set in motion and you're totally helpless to stop it.  Yes.  And that's what's so frustrating.  And yet, and I forget what Jonathan was telling me, the traffic is like that, where their commutes are about three hours a day each way. 
[00:31:30]  This guy, you know, it might be Jakarta or Indonesia, which is the worst traffic in the world where they deal with that.  Right.  Like, every day going to work and every day coming back home.  But that doesn't break you down crying.  Like, when me and Ann used to commute together and we were doing afternoons, it was a little rough.  But you knew what you had.  As soon as you got in your car, you knew exactly what you had and you dealt with it.  When it's more than that is when, you're still mad.  But when it's more than that is when you start getting the frustration and then possibly breaking down wanting to cry. 
[00:32:00]  Do you remember when I was living on 43rd Street and we were off the air and you came...  Oh my, the Metallica show.  No.  Oh, that was bad too.  No, no, no.  When I had to go to Cleveland with stupid, my buddy Gina was the opening act, I think, and you came and we hit gridlock leaving my apartment.  There was...  I thought that was for the Metallica show.  No.  That was...  Then we'd done it a couple times.  That was going to the airport.  There was fucking, leave my apartment on 43rd Street.  You make a left and you're in a block and a half, two blocks to the Lincoln Tunnel.  That's it.  But there was a water main break and it was stopped. 
[00:32:30]  And it might have taken us 25 minutes to get to the end of the block and around.  Like, we're going to miss the fucking plane.  So I made the driver take us to the fucking Port Authority and we took the train.  Oh, fuck yeah.  We got all about this.  But that was that type of traffic where I'm just watching.  Like, we're going to miss the fucking plane.  Yeah, when you have to be somewhere like that, especially for a plane.  For a plane.  Then you start getting violent.  Dude, it's...  Yeah.  I remember that.  Oh, it was terrible.  But you know the grid of the city and like I said, you know how to make moves usually.  But when all your moves are failing you, you just want to pull over and go, could someone 
[00:33:00]  help me?  You know, you just...  It's whatever, but...  I would always rather be in the city because worse came to worse, you could always just  put it in a garage, get out and fucking take the...  Like, you know you have...  That's the atom bomb.  Yeah.  If I have to park this piece of shit illegally in a yellow zone, like, I can do that.  That's the fucking...  That's the A-bomb.  But when you're on the LIE...  Oh, and there's no way to go. 
[00:33:30]  You're in between exits.  The LIE is the worst.  You're dead stop.  It's like...  It's like...  Sorry, the LIE is the worst road in America.  Worst road in the country.  You're just going to be like falling down.  You're just fucking...  You're just fucking get out of your car.  And just walk.  Walk away.  And do horrible things, I guess.  I don't know.  Oh, awesome.  My skin cancer just came off.  Oh, Jesus.  No, she said that would happen.  It's pre-pre, by the way, but...  Look, yeah.  The pre...  My skin cancer's gone, officially.  She said it would scab up and fall off. 
[00:34:00]  I'll pick.  I should have ate it.  Oh, God.  We'll have gotten someone else to.  That's right.  Have a bite of cancer.  Oh, fuck.  I've had traffic like that in L.A. once or twice.  L.A. can be horrendous.  Brutal.  Connecticut literally...  Ooh, 95.  If they carved Connecticut off and then just kicked it into the ocean, for traffic reasons  only, I would be fine with it.  95?  It's the most underrated traffic piece of shit fucking state in the entire country. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah, I think you're right.  Because it's by New York and it's between New York and Boston, so we get all the fucking  the heat, and L.A. gets all the heat, but Connecticut fucking eats my ass when it  comes to traffic.  95.  Abominable.  It's one long traffic jam.  Terrible.  It's one long rush hour.  Terrible.  And the bad thing about it is you'll be on 95 doing a good clip and thinking, oh, this  ain't so bad, and then, wham, you dead stopped some kind of fucking construction.  How many times did we do the Boston to Long Island trip? 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  I was telling people about that.  You know that we left Boston on a Saturday?  What was our shift?  We were over by noon, maybe?  Oh, God, when we had to work Saturdays.  I think we were done by noon.  Yeah, we did by noon.  And we wanted to come home and visit.  So we would leave Saturday at noon as a group, get to Long Island, and then drive back Sunday  night.  Do you remember that?  I drove back Monday mornings a few times.  That's right.  Yeah.  Wow.  Monday morning to make the afternoon show.  Is that when you were already living up there or when you first went up? 
[00:35:30]  Did you guys move up there?  I was living up there, yeah.  Like, from when you got the gig, did you automatically get apartments up there or did you work for  a month?  No, we lived with my mother-in-law.  Up there?  Yeah.  Oh, you did go right away?  Right away, yeah.  Yeah, right away.  And I think, didn't we both just have to leave the girls down here for a while?  She should have fucking stayed, too.  Yeah, believe me.  Not in the same fucking way.  I get this amazing gig.  She doesn't want to go.  I'm like, whatever.  Then stay fucking home. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, did she not want to move?  And then she moved up, I don't even remember anymore, it's been so long, but six months  later, I think, something like that.  And then when we got fired from Boston, she didn't want to leave Boston.  I'm like, whatever, then stay up there.  Yeah.  And then I told the story, I'm coming through the tolls, I'm listening to N.E.W., they were  playing the Allman Brothers, I remember like it was yesterday, and I'm paying the toll  to go to Long Island, because we are now moving back to New York for this amazing gig.  Shoot.  And I didn't have easy pass, and we're waiting to pay the toll at the Throgs Neck Bridge. 
[00:36:30]  I remember this like yesterday, and I look over to my right, and she's fucking crying.  This is the break of my life.  What's wrong with you?  Oh, chicks.  And I should have told her, all right, then just stay in Boston.  What good are you?  Yeah.  If you can't get up for the fact that we're moving to New York and, you know, going to  be on New York radio, what do you want from me?  That should have been a sign.  You sure she wasn't crying because you didn't have easy pass yet? 
[00:37:00]  That's why I would have been.  Yeah, right.  Look at them zipping by in the left lane.  It's so fast.  That should have been a sign, but I'll tell you, five years later, I did something about  it.  Five, I know.  Five fucking years later.  I went through nine years of fucking hell for nothing.  Oh, fuck.  Why is my phone beeping?  What the hell was that?  Beep, beep.  You have a good boy phone.  Why do you have a fucking black face?  I'll tell you why he does. 
[00:37:30]  Why?  He's got a good boy phone and a naughty boy phone, a naughty boy's phone and his good boy's  phone.  He's got a good boy's phone and a naughty boy phone.  Oh, that's the happy Jimmy.  A naughty boy phone and a good boy.  What an idiot.  You laugh the way through it.  Does anyone have a charger?  I plugged my phone in and I guess, I don't know, maybe it wasn't in the wall.  Maybe my kid fucking ripped the plug out of the wall.  An iPhone charger?  Uh, Android? 
[00:38:00]  Oh boy.  An Android charger, huh?  Also a BlackBerry charger.  Oh boy.  Do they make those?  The new BlackBerry charger where it got thin because they wouldn't need you to fuck, they  need to change the chargers.  Really?  Just so you can't use your old ones, right?  Right.  Really?  Because it's all about accessories, right?  Fucking assholes.  Does BlackBerry come with a picture of an ass on the cover and a big dick in it?  They're terrible.  Well, now the dick is thinner.  That's what they do.  That's nice.  They gave you a thinner dick for your ass. 
[00:38:30]  I'm sort of out of the BlackBerry world finally.  I mean, I have this for corporate email because I refuse to give this company any of my other  email accounts.  And so I lost one of my chargers.  I'm like, oh, I got my old BlackBerry charger.  This is perfect.  It's a different charger.  Yeah.  Why?  Which one you got?  I got the BlackBerry charger.  Oh, you rule.  Yeah.  Hey, Roland, Roland.  I'll put this shit in.  Roland comes in.  He comes through.  Thanks, brother.  Comes through in a pinch.  Comes through in a pinch.  Oh, anyway, we were talking about Boston because we were leading to something. 
[00:39:00]  We were leading.  Jimmy, listen closely.  Oh, good.  Hey, it's time for the get your ass off the couch and go do something to report.  Here's my buddy.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Ah.  Look at Jimmy's face.  Look at Jimmy's face.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh.  What was that?  Wow.  Well, Anthony, I think Anthony referenced it last week out of nowhere. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, yes, I did, unfortunately.  I really don't remember we used to do this, but at AF, we did the, what was it?  Get off.  Get your ass off the couch report.  Go do something report.  It was, uh, it was, uh, yeah, it was a sponsored thing that Dave Dickless, our program director,  made us do.  By who, Massengill?  That's a douche.  And we had to, like, like, paw through the local fucking rag bar magazines and find what 
[00:40:00]  bands were playing where and kind of do a whole rundown of what's going on in Boston  because Dave Douglas thought, you know, people needed to know.  And, uh, oh, God.  Oh, first of all, what the hell?  Whose voices were those?  Whose voices were those?  Yeah, I was telling.  They were pumping helium into the studio back then.  I was telling the guys before the show, I mean, uh, I mean, a fact is a fact.  We were looked at as, like, rock stars up there in Boston. 
[00:40:30]  Oh.  I don't know why.  Because I listen back, everything stinks.  Because I listen to this, and I'm like, what were these people thinking?  Everything is just horrific.  It's horrific.  I guess people just, it was before smartphones.  Yeah, yeah.  They were starved.  They were starved for entertainment.  Starved for entertainment.  They would accept anything.  And there was no way for one person to really get their point across if they thought we sucked  to everyone to point it out.  Right.  Like, oh, my God, why are they doing that? 
[00:41:00]  That sucks.  And then you'd be like, you'd read a website or tweets or something and be like, yeah,  that does suck.  Yeah, yeah.  And then the whole wave of people that hate you starts up.  But people were actually able to think individually back then.  It wasn't a collective.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  It wasn't a collective like the Borg.  They couldn't get together.  Right.  They couldn't gang up.  They couldn't gang up.  Is that all that's on that CD?  Oh.  And do some flash mob hating.  Oh, no.  Yeah, that's all.  That's all.  Oh, is there more?  Unfortunately, that's all I like to call him asshole from Connecticut came up with. 
[00:41:30]  I didn't hear the beginning.  Kevin from Connecticut.  I guess Kevin from Connecticut.  I didn't know he went that far back with us.  He's got old fucking tapes of ours.  Ah.  Because Ant referenced this, and next thing you know, he's tweeting this over the weekend.  Yeah, yeah.  What is it?  Kevin from Khan, his Twitter name?  Wow.  It was just...  Khan with two N's.  That's abominable.  We have a little more.  Can I hear the beginning again?  Because I want to hear any context.  No, you...  Oh, God.  Watch Jimmy's face.  I'll be okay now.  I know you can't out there, but watch Jimmy's face. 
[00:42:00]  Hey, it's time for the get your ass off the couch and go do something to report.  Here's my buddy.  Get that.  Thank you.  Bah, bah, bah.  Dude, that literally...  It makes me shudder.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What were the names?  They would change constantly.  It's too long to change.  See, what happens...  Bah, bah.  What happens is, when you say something long enough, and many times, you change it.  And it becomes, like, its own word.  Our names just kind of became, bah, bah, bah. 
[00:42:30]  Like, Anthony became, bah, bah.  And Obie just became, bah, bah.  But it was a slow change.  See, it wasn't a thing like, let's call ourselves this.  It was a organic kind of change from the name to a thing.  It's like a...  I'm trying to explain this, and it's going nowhere.  There's no way to explain it.  You guys are a couple of quok suckers.  Yeah. 
[00:43:00]  Quok.  People, like, listening, they said that was like a punch in the stomach.  Uh, ew.  Where did that come from?  Oh, God!  Exclamation point.  Chills.  Chills.  It's almost like, he's got a, nah, nah, phone, and a, nah, nah, phone.  Right.  See?  But now people know what you mean.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Believe me.  We'll, uh...  Believe me.  I, uh...  I guess we'll get into that after the break, huh?  Yeah, I'd like to hear a little more of that. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, God.  We'll play, uh...  It's a whole minute and 40 seconds.  Oh, boy!  Hey, we gotta get off your head and report here.  Thank you.  What's with the voices?  I don't know.  What happened?  I guess we've, uh...  Our voices have matured over the years.  I listen to stuff from the beginning of XM, even two years into that, and it's still like,  the voices sound so different.  Yeah, what the fuck?  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I listen to stuff and go, fuck, that sounds different.  Yeah.  This guy's saying, uh, Memorial Day weekend, 25 miles of traffic from Greenwich, Connecticut 
[00:44:00]  to Bridgeport.  Oh.  Just one long fucking traffic jam.  How do you do it?  Wow, I hate that.  Well, the people, you know, that came before us didn't figure out this road system.  No.  They just thought we needed only two, maybe three lanes of fucking highway.  Everyone's gotta get where they're going.  It's a pain in the fucking ass, yeah.  I think we stop at ten lanes.  Ten lane highways.  No one would ever be in traffic.  There would be some idiot in the tenth fucking lane, holding up the whole fucking shittery. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah, I guess.  It doesn't matter.  People drive like idiots, and that's why there's traffic.  Fucking morons.  They never know how to go around things.  You ever see somebody parked on the side of the road?  You ever see someone parked on the side of the road, like their car's broken down,  and they're kind of pulled over, and a little bit of them is sticking into maybe the right  lane, but most of them is on the shoulder, and even people in the left lane have to jam 
[00:45:00]  on their brakes.  Yeah, it just stops everything.  And if everyone just kind of moved over a little bit and maintained speed, it wouldn't  even be a problem.  But everyone's gotta just stop, because they think it's dangerous, or they gotta look,  or it's just something.  Just fucking go.  So, when a rubbernecker is in front of me, by the way, if there's an accident on the  other side of the road, I just wait.  The second I see fucking brake lights from the person in front of me, I lay on the fucking 
[00:45:30]  horn.  There's no reason you should be fucking on your brakes.  But you know you watch, or look, without slowing down, though.  I could give a quick fucking peek without touching the brake pedal.  Believe me, no one should even let off the gas.  Fuck you.  Move.  I hate those people.  Unless it's a plane crash.  If there's a plane crash in the other lane, I would be like, alright, I understand why  you want to stop.  I gotta take a look.  Yeah.  What about the picnics that pop up?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I look at the picnics on the side of the road. 
[00:46:00]  Those are usually the parkways.  I think they finally...  I haven't seen a picnic in a while.  I swear to you, man.  There was a time if a certain minority broke down on the side of the road, they had hibachis  in their fucking cars, and they would start picnics on the side of the road waiting for  the tow truck.  Lay a blanket down, start cooking, kids are running all over the place.  And I know you've seen them, too, but I haven't seen them lately.  They don't call them a picnic, either.  I know.  It was called another word.  Yeah, yeah.  That sounds like pic. 
[00:46:30]  Yes, yes, yes.  But it was a derogatory term.  But I guess they finally said, you know what?  We can't have picnics on the side of the parkways.  Yes.  Sorry, people, but you're going to have to find another place to do this.  Yeah, another place to fucking do it.  It's a highway system here.  I haven't seen one of those in probably maybe 10 years.  But there was a time you would see this shit.  All the time.  All the fucking time.  I don't know what that was about.  Hey, I know we're doing too much traffic shit, but something happened to me Saturday night,  and there's something going on out there, and hopefully someone with more knowledge 
[00:47:00]  could tell me what the fuck this is about.  Yeah, this is odd.  I don't know if it's a thing.  I told Anthony, and he couldn't figure it out either.  Like, I've never seen it before.  So Saturday night, I'm on the Cross County Parkway.  I've got to make it local for people because this is what this is about.  Coming home at midnight on Saturday night, I pull onto the parkway.  It's me, my wife, and my little kid.  He's asleep.  I had a good night out.  And also, I'm driving along about 60, 65 miles an hour, not too crazy. 
[00:47:30]  And all of a sudden, everyone jams on their brakes.  Listen closely because I need someone to fucking figure this out.  Everyone jams on their brakes.  So me as the driver, I'm thinking, okay, was there a fender bender?  Did someone hit a deer?  Is a deer crossing the road?  And then I'm thinking my final option is someone having a problem with somebody else, another car.  Maybe a car cut someone off.  I'm going to fuck with you, right?  So now we're at a complete stop on the Cross County Parkway. 
[00:48:00]  And I'm looking around.  I'm in a group of cars.  And I'm like, what the fuck's going on here?  No one's moving.  And I'm looking ahead, and I'm like, what the fuck?  Someone has their, I forgot to tell you this, their brake lights on the whole time in the slow lane.  And all of a sudden, the guy with the brake lights on in the slow lane peels out, peels the fuck out.  And then everyone peels out.  And I'm like, all right.  This was my first clue that there's a group of people doing something.  So I get it back up to speed. 
[00:48:30]  And then all of a sudden, less than a mile down the road, the guy with the blinking lights in the slow lane,  even though he was going the fastest, jams on his brakes again.  Everyone jams on their brakes.  And I swear to you, a car to my right goes into the guardrail and crashes.  Not bad, but crashes his car.  I'm like, what the fuck is this?  So then I'm in the middle lane at this point, and I see there's an opening to the left.  I'm like, I'm getting the fuck out of here.  So I try to make a move to the left lane.  A minivan pulls in front of me that's part of this group and doesn't let me go. 
[00:49:00]  Now I'm thinking, goddammit, I wish I was Anthony Coombe with a fucking gun.  Because now I'm thinking, am I going to get carjacked?  What's going on here?  Then the guy gets out of the car, and he's sort of pointing at this one car.  And I'm like, are those the two having problems?  And this guy just won't let it go.  Then at that point, we look to our right, and there's a car next to us, and they're all laughing in the car.  I'm like, what the fuck is this?  Once again, the guy, because he got out of the car, this is the key to it, the guy obviously was signaling something. 
[00:49:30]  Because he got out of the car, he pointed at this one guy, I thought he was yelling at him, I thought he was having a problem with him.  Gets back in his car.  He peels off by himself.  I forgot to tell you that.  About 100 to 200 yards down the parkway.  Jams on his brakes, and now reverses, and comes back to the pile.  And this is a major highway.  Yes.  Cross County Parkway.  People know this fucking road.  And then all of a sudden, the guy peels out again, and they all fucking take off again. 
[00:50:00]  And then they jammed down the brakes again, but at that point, I was lucky enough that I had an exit I could get off, and I was out of that.  It's not like a flash mob, but driving.  Ah, might be, right?  Like, they're fucking with people, not you necessarily, but anybody who isn't them.  And they were young Hispanic people?  Yeah, they had super...  Is that what we're, uh...  Young, anywhere from, tough to tell, mid-20s to mid-30s, probably.  Were they racing? Were there two of the cars racing? Were they blocking for people racing? 
[00:50:30]  They all were. There was about, if I'm looking back now, at least five to six cars involved with this, at least.  But as soon as the one guy stopped, they all would jam on their brakes.  So it's enough to fuck up all of the traffic.  I don't know if they were trying to get people to crash into each other behind them.  I have no idea. I don't know what the fuck this was, but...  They were racing... Hold on a second here.  Let me say hi to Marcos and Yonkers. Marcos.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up?  What's going on? What you saw was actually drag racing. 
[00:51:00]  What they do is a group of cars.  It could be 10 to 15 cars.  They stop on the parkway, and the first two cars peel off, and everyone else follows them to see who wins.  But they weren't even going that far.  Oh, so they stopped traffic so they could start their race.  Oh, they stopped traffic so they have...  And they got some room.  Oh, and maybe the...  That's why maybe I couldn't get past them, because they didn't want anyone.  They wanted just open road. 
[00:51:30]  Right.  And then they...  Exactly why.  They take off, and then the other guys follow them to see who won.  But then they all jam on the brakes at the same time.  Maybe they're all on phones?  No?  No, no, you can't hold the iPhone.  Then they do it again.  No, what it is is that they stop the traffic behind them to make sure no police...  They say there's a county cop way behind.  They can't come up to the front.  And they're all together.  They're all rolled together, and they go to different places and race like that.  Uh-huh.  And they're laughing and shit. 
[00:52:00]  I mean, I saw a car accident.  A guy was last guy into the pile.  And I actually tried to avoid the car in front of him, and he hit the guardrail.  I'm like, what the fuck's going on?  When you're stopped, when you have to jam on the brakes like that, do you always think,  I'm going to be paralyzed by the guy behind me?  Yeah, yeah.  You look in the rearview mirror.  I always look.  And you look like, does it look like he's slowing down?  Okay, he's slowing down.  He's slowing down.  And then he's dead if someone else comes and rear-ends him.  Yeah.  I think Marcos might be on to something, because it absolutely looked like some type of drag  racing.  But what was confusing me was they weren't going that far, and then the guy backing up 
[00:52:30]  his car on the parkway.  That makes perfect sense.  This guy had complete control of the road.  Yeah.  But I was like, I'm trying to figure out what the end game is here.  Are they going to carjack somebody?  Are they hoping cars crash behind this group of cars?  Yeah.  I could see what this guy means.  They just stop traffic.  Guys will race.  Then they take off.  Stop again.  Yeah.  Oh, it seems a little dangerous. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  It was...  Jesus.  I was like, fuck, why don't I have a gun?  I would be thinking I was getting jacked.  Marcos, I think you're on to something.  Head on a swivel.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Greg in California.  Greg?  Joe.  Hey.  Ow.  I'm down in Southern California, but up in Oakland, there's a group of blacks that'll  shut down an entire highway and have a party in the middle of the highway, and they call  it sideshows.  You can look it up on the internet.  What do they call it?  Sideshows. 
[00:53:30]  Sideshows.  But how do they close down the road without the authorities getting involved?  They're going to force everybody and stop the traffic that is coming, and then they'll  park their cars in front of everybody, and then they'll just stop the entire fucking  I-80 and have a party in the middle of the street.  I shit you not.  I believe you.  They do that shit in Brazil, but they rob you.  They do it in Mexico, too, but they'll stop traffic and then go door to car to car  with a machine gun.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That's how you can get kidnapped, but they usually just rob you.  But with this Oakland situation, how long do the parties last before the cops go, all 
[00:54:00]  right, we've got to stop the fucking party in the middle of the highway?  The cops usually can't get up there that fast because there's miles and miles of traffic  now because they shut it down.  Wow.  So some motherfuckers.  They usually have to go to the other way and drive the opposite way on the highway, which  is hard to do.  I got to admit, I'm old.  Finally.  Just have no idea.  It's time to throw in.  Shit like this is going on.  Dude, I'm trying to throw in the youth hat, man, because this shit going on out there, I  have no idea about it anymore.  I used to know shit.  I didn't know this drag racing thing where they're stopping all traffic so they can fucking 
[00:54:30]  race.  I don't know about sideshows.  Sideshows we're learning about today.  I didn't know about this shit.  The fuck?  I read a few great articles on a few more flash mob fucking robberies and beatings over the  weekend.  And some of the mainstream news is starting to actually say these are groups of black  men, teens and men that are doing this. 
[00:55:00]  15 to 20 of them coming up and just beat the piss out of some fucking guy, robbed him.  And then again, another group, about 15, just beat up some guy, took his bike.  And it's just like fucking, I'm glad someone's acknowledging that there's a problem in a  certain community with these flash mob robberies.  Just as you said, I thought we were going to break.  I was just going to jokingly tease something like, hey, we're kind of winning a certain  battle.  In the daily news, Central Park, Seek 4 and Central Park mugging. 
[00:55:30]  And there's a picture of these, a black suspect, but it says police received a sketch of the  subject who's described as a black male.  And they say their three subjects are black males, age 14.  And there was a while where they weren't doing, they were not saying the word.  I'm noticing a trend now.  And I think it has to do with a lot of this happening that people want to know.  People are sick of it.  Yeah.  If you're legitimately describing a person and you're describing the sweatshirt they're 
[00:56:00]  wearing, which they could change, but not the skin color.  Yeah.  Saying somebody's a white suspect or a black suspect automatically excludes a lot of people.  Right.  Yes.  But when you say that the suspect is described as 5'10 with a burgundy sweatshirt.  What the fuck?  Just say this.  A Van Heusen sweater.  Yes.  He was blinking a lot and he had glasses and a cowlick.  Why don't you just say, we don't have the courage to list certain aspects of this.  Yeah.  And I wonder if the reporters got sick of it.  They're like, what are we doing?  They probably did. 
[00:56:30]  I think the people are getting sick of it.  Sick of it.  When you read about these flash mob robberies and beatings, just random violence that's  going on.  And realize, you know, it's mostly from what I've seen on videos and read and researched,  mostly young black guys.  For some reason, they just want to go out and beat the fuck out of people.  You know, and it should be described that way in the paper. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  That's who did it.  Why don't we say who did it?  I want to see a video of Sideshow.  These Sideshows that are going on.  They called Sideshows on the Highway?  Sideshows.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Uh, oh, here's a guy that does.  Oh, all right.  Perfect.  I'm going to get my answer.  Drew in Jersey.  Drew.  Yeah.  This happens all the time.  Like, they go on industrial roads or highways, anything, and they'll block off traffic.  You see the hazard lights.  The two up front will race, either from a stop or from, like, rolling for miles per hour, 
[00:57:30]  and they'll race.  They'll stop again.  They'll race.  You can go on YouTube, and you can just type in, like, a car.  Are you part of this, Drew?  Uh, I've engaged in a couple.  It scared the shit out of me, because I didn't know what the fuck it was.  What, do you got a Toyota Corolla with a wing on the back?  Civic.  So is there...  Civic.  Is there one guy that kind of just, uh, cues everyone to stop the traffic?  And how many cars are involved, usually, and how many cars are racing?  Like, I need to know the whole thing, because there were definitely a couple guys who absolutely 
[00:58:00]  seemed to be racing, but then there were everyone else taking off at the same time behind  them.  So how many cars do you usually get together?  Usually what happens is they're able to meet up at a place, like, I don't know, like a  Dunkin' Donuts, they'll fill up the parking lot, and they'll, like, negotiate a race or  something in, like, a whole parking lot.  It could be 50, 100 cars.  They all leave.  They go to a spot, and they'll do it.  So it could be a lot of cars.  But you have stopped traffic on a main highway?  I haven't been on a highway. 
[00:58:30]  Mostly, like, industrial road.  I know.  This was on the Cross County Parkway.  People know it.  They did live in the area.  All right.  All right.  Yeah.  There's that other one where you go neck and neck with somebody at about, you know, 30,  40 miles an hour, and then you give three beeps on the horn.  Bam.  Bam.  Bam.  And on the third beep, you both fucking just take off.  That's like a flying start.  That's not a standstill.  Right.  So if you ever hear three fucking beeps, just slow down.  And one more, and then we'll move on. 
[00:59:00]  Bill in Boston.  Bill.  Hey, Opie.  Hello, Bill.  The reason why they're going short distances is that's what drag racing is.  Do you guys remember?  No, I know what drag racing is.  But, I mean, what's the shortest drag race, though?  Two feet.  You want to do a quarter mile.  Come on.  Do you guys remember $4.95 when you lived up in Massachusetts?  Of course.  Okay.  Well, what we used to do is we used to go about 2.30 in the morning and do this. 
[00:59:30]  There's a whole lot less, you know, guys with their wife and baby on that point in time.  And you're not fucking anybody over.  You just start.  You have a four-guy stop the lines.  And then you just take off.  That's all you have to do.  Yeah, but my point, once again, is then there's other cars involved to stop all traffic on  the highway so you guys got an open road.  All right.  That's what we should do, but I don't understand this.  You seem to be a little less responsible, isn't it?  All right.  Less responsible.  If you're doing it at all, it's irresponsible.  What are you going to do?  It's really not a...  I've seen good videos, Anthony. 
[01:00:00]  Come on.  Hey, come on.  Yeah, you got some crazy ones.  Ah, yeah.  I don't go down the highway like that.  All right, brother.  Maybe I don't know.  Someone's saying look up world's wildest sideshows on YouTube.  World's wildest sideshows on Spike.  Are we learning about sideshows today?  I've never heard this term before.  Have you heard the sideshow term before?  I've never heard of this.  Wildest sideshows.  I don't know what this is.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, this could be the right video.  Oh, they're showing up.  Uh-oh.  They're zooming in on California.  They're showing up Oakland.  Yeah, y'all.  So far, it's just a map still.  Map, map, map.  Oakland.  Wildest sideshows.  Wildest sideshows.  Uncensored, bitch.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, look at Cole Burner. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, God.  This is my nightmare.  These are my nightmare.  Look, fights.  They're just fucking, they're driving their cars around and peeling out in the intersections,  making a lot of smoke.  And it's just wild black guys fucking doing wild shit.  The doors are open.  They open the doors, hang out of them, and start doing fucking burnouts.  Now that it's all the chicks doing the ass dance out the windows of the cars.  Where is this? 
[01:01:30]  I'll tell you one thing.  Why is this part of America?  They're having more fun than we do on the weekends.  Yeah, it's fun.  Look.  Look, they've just completely taken over the street.  Yeah, look.  No one could use that street.  No, no, this street is unusable.  But who really wants to drive down that street anyway, I bet.  Everyone's now out of their cars.  And it's just chicks like fucking doing their fuck me in the ass dance.  I like this.  He was riding in the trunk, cut loose.  Look, they're standing all over the cars. 
[01:02:00]  I think this is great.  I think it's great.  Because do everything that you're doing, because it's more of a chance for me to succeed.  Yes, true.  You know what I mean?  Don't think.  Don't use your brain.  Spend all your money on rims, because now I have a better shot.  Don't I have to get up for jobs tomorrow?  Oh, I'll be.  Look at these guys.  What I'm seeing here is beyond anything.  You know what this is?  It's a beatnik.  What was it called?  Freaknik.  Freakniks.  Excuse me.  This is Freaknik. 
[01:02:30]  We saw this shit in Atlanta.  Yep.  That at one time.  They don't like shutting their doors when they drive, for some reason.  Oh, my God.  And you know what, too?  They don't like to walk on sidewalks when there's a perfectly good sidewalk available.  Nuh-uh.  I don't understand what that means.  Walk in the street, yo.  Oh, great question coming in, Ant.  Great question coming in.  I kind of like this song.  I know.  I know.  I was just really quite enjoying that.  Digging on it.  Silly Goose, a regular.  He writes, Ant, 
[01:03:00]  would you rather live a month in Oakland?  Mm-hmm.  Basically in the area we just saw.  Uh-huh.  This is going to be a rough one.  Or?  And you got to answer.  You have to answer.  Jesus.  Or live a month with your ex.  Holy shit.  Wow, what a great question.  This could be the perfect question.  All right, all right.  You saw the video.  You have to live right in the middle of that shit.  I can logically figure this out.  All right.  I have to live in that place for a month. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  Or with the ex-wife for a month.  Yeah.  If I chose the ex-wife,  I'd be living the rest of my life with those people.  Because I will have killed my wife.  So I will go with Oakland for a month.  Wow.  Because I would end up in prison.  Call it Oaktown.  Oaktown?  Is that what they call it?  The Oaktown.  I don't know.  I think so.  Oh, this is Sideshow Niggas Mobbing on Females. 
[01:04:00]  Yo.  Well.  In East Oakland.  Well, you got to.  Oaktown.  If you got to females,  you got to do some of that mobbing.  Look, they just drive around in circles.  Are they mobbing?  What are they saying?  Nothing.  Nothing?  Oh, sorry.  Oh, you can't hear them.  They're mobbing on some females.  What is mobbing?  Is that like rape?  Come over here. 
[01:04:30]  Get in the core.  That's a scary accent to me.  Oh, it is.  West Coast black guys don't fucking play dance.  Yeah, man.  That scares the shit out of me.  Get out the core.  Get out the motherfucking core.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a scary one.  I don't like that.  That's a fucking hardcore West Coast.  She's going to get her herded.  And I got the final piece of the puzzle of what happened to me Saturday.  All right.  They go short distances.  Thank you, Sean.  I don't have time to go to you.  Because of exits on the parkway.  Oh.  And entrance ramps.  Oh. 
[01:05:00]  Because they're trying to keep it safe.  Like they're trying to race without anybody else on the road.  Right.  So they go to the rear end of some fucking station wagon.  Right.  So they go short distances.  Because, yeah.  Oh, okay.  They don't want people coming in, you know, onto the parkway in front of them.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Now I understand what happened to me this Saturday.  Do you think Honest Abe Lincoln would have been at one of the sideshow niggas mobbing on females?  I wonder if he saw that coming.  There's probably a lot of things he didn't see coming.  I understand. 
[01:05:30]  Smartphones.  I know.  I'm just saying.  Believe me.  I just chose one thing.  I just chose sideshow niggas mobbing on females.  Well, let's just say, look at Anthony Weiner's scandal.  Do you think George Washington saw that coming?  Something that someday a member of his government would photograph their cock and send it out to everybody?  Jimmy, I am not arguing a bit.  I just chose one thing.  You chose another.  Mr. Weiner is...  It didn't go away. 
[01:06:00]  No.  No school shootings this weekend.  No fucking plane crashes.  He's MIA.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  We got a break.  We're just battling it.  Can I plug one thing?  It's not even for me.  I just saw it in the paper.  Yeah.  HBO has a Bobby Fischer documentary.  Ooh.  It's called Tonight at 9 o'clock.  I just saw that in the Daily News.  And I was talking to...  I saw Bonnie McFarlane at the cellar this weekend, Rich's wife, and we chatted about Bobby Fischer.  So now I'm just going to annoy her until she watches it on Bobby Fischer.  So please retweet Bonnie McFarlane on her Twitter and tell her to watch the Bobby Fischer documentary. 
[01:06:30]  She was asking questions.  That must be something for her to be able to actually have an intelligent conversation with somebody every so often and then having to go home.  She looked good, too.  Did she?  Oh, yeah.  But she said Rich is in Minneapolis.  Speaking of that, did you see him on the local TV?  Oh, God.  You saw that, too?  Yeah, yeah.  No.  See, that's why you got to be on Twitter.  Someone goes, we follow you.  We don't actually have to be on Twitter.  Whatever.  Then follow us.  Yeah, whatever.  Just check out our shit because there's some great stuff always going around. 
[01:07:00]  Someone was tweeting Rich on local TV in Minneapolis.  Yeah.  Where he's flirting with the on-air host.  Then he's wearing his crazy golf outfit.  His golf outfit.  That was funny.  It was pretty funny.  Oh, Jimmy, when we get back.  Oh, in case people forgot.  We'll explain this when we get back.  Hey, it's time for the get your ass off the couch and go do something to report.  Here's my buddy.  Dad, doc.  Thank you.  Dad, man.  Sirius XM.  The virus.  Sheriff, it looks like we've found another body. 
[01:07:30]  This is the third one this week.  I think it's about time we call in the FBI.  Somewhere out there, a killer is on the loose.  Why, yes, Sheriff.  I have been following that story in the papers.  It used to be such a peaceful little town.  And there's only one man who can catch him.  Now, don't you worry.  I'm going to send my best man down there to help you in your investigation.  But he was busy. 
[01:08:00]  Here comes fucking ferret face.  Whatever.  All right, Agent Voss.  Someone's out there murdering innocent women.  I want you to go down there and assist the local sheriff.  You're one of the bad.  Get down there and help the sheriff.  How could he be a profiler?  His vocabulary is so bad.  Yeah, but no one listens.  This summer, the Opie and Anthony Show presents a comedy about an idiotic comedian pretending to be an FBI agent.  So, you work a lot of murders before? 
[01:08:30]  Now, we're doing mainly a lot on terrorists and terrorist-type threats and stuff like that.  But, you know, back in the day, it was more murder.  What are some of the cases you worked on?  Just, you know, Seattle, the Green River.  What do you call it?  Look, I can't talk a lot about it.  I don't get this much in detail.  Starring Jim Norton.  He just keeps saying profile, profilers.  Other profilers, profilers.  And Rich Voss.  Great minds think a lot.  I like, oh my God.  The Profiler.  Coming to a theater nowhere near you or anyone else. 
[01:09:00]  Thank baby Jesus.  Sirius XM.  The virus.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  We got Dan Weldon coming in today.  Yes. 
[01:09:30]  Exactly.  He's the guy that lucked out and won the Indianapolis 500 because Dummy crashed on the last lap.  Oops.  And then Dan Weldon said, well, I'll fucking win this thing.  And he did just that.  Yeah.  So we talked to him today because he's got a good story.  He's sitting there in second place going, oh, well, well, I'll take second.  Oh, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  I'm going to win this thing now.  What's that up ahead?  So we'll talk to him for five minutes and get him the fuck out of here.  You know, I'm just fucking off already. 
[01:10:00]  It's like the catch you were saying.  Oh, my God.  Like the catch.  Remember the catch?  Is he going to write a whole book on this?  Didn't Dan Weldon used to drive the Sirius car?  Did he?  Did he?  That's what Denver Pest is saying.  Then we, I think we talked to this guy before.  And then someone says no.  Oh, okay.  End of discussion.  Sirius never sponsored Indy.  Only XM did.  Well, I'm just reading a conversation between two people.  This is great.  Do we still have.  Yes. 
[01:10:30]  Josh Gad coming in Thursday.  Who?  We do, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  From Book of Mormon.  He was not in the one I saw.  I saw it Saturday.  You finally saw it.  Yeah, he wasn't.  His second.  Whatever they call it.  The understudy did it.  Because he was, I guess, in a throat thing.  Yeah.  And it's so funny when they announced right before the play started.  Tonight, the part of Brother, whatever we played by.  And I was sitting next to, like, a 60-year-old woman.  And she was like, oh, that blows. 
[01:11:00]  This blows.  Wow.  She was 60 years old.  And she kept saying, this blows.  Dude, it was fucking great.  A theater goer.  Well, he's nominated for a Tony.  She wanted to see him.  I didn't know the difference.  I think they should never tell the audience.  Because I bet you 90% of the audience wouldn't even know.  Wouldn't even know.  Wait a minute.  Who's in a gang?  I don't know.  Yeah.  Jason something.  But it was fucking, what a masterpiece the Book of Mormon is.  Good, huh?  Dude, I'm not a musical person.  I hate musicals. 
[01:11:30]  I fucking hate them.  You're not looking at the program going, oh, fuck, only 12 songs to go?  Did you do any of that shit?  How did you do that?  I fucking.  It was a long night.  I loved it.  It was brilliant.  The songs were really great.  It's fucking hilarious.  It's smart.  It's like I had heard it so much.  It was better than I thought it would be.  Wow.  I really liked it.  And it was a couple.  I was by myself.  I wish I would have went with a friend or a fucking chick or something.  Because I laughed out loud at a few of the lines.  And a few of the things really caught me off guard. 
[01:12:00]  Oh.  Wow, really?  Those guys are fucking.  They are fucking brilliant.  So ballsy and edgy.  Give it away.  Most people listening to us will never see this.  But there's really nothing to give away.  Far away lines.  It's simply about Mormons.  And the story is known.  It's about a group of Mormons who are.  Joe Smith?  Yeah.  They discuss how the Mormon church began.  And there's a group of them that go to Africa.  They're all being assigned places. 
[01:12:30]  And this group goes to Uganda to try to convert Africans to Mormonism.  Or Mormon, whatever you call it.  And it's fucking amazing how good it is.  So I don't know how.  Josh is supposed to be great.  But the guy that subs for him, it was phenomenal too.  Yeah.  Such a good.  It's sold out for a month.  They don't need us promoting it.  But it was a real.  I cannot rave enough about how much I loved it.  It's a hit.  It's hilarious, dude.  I go Wednesday.  I can't wait.  Really brilliant. 
[01:13:00]  Really brilliant.  It's like they're so good.  This is what Matt and Trey are so good at.  Absolute ridicule.  They're amazing at absolute ridicule without anger.  That's the thing about them that's so great.  And that to me is what makes Colin great.  Is the way they can absolutely dissect something without anger.  And that's anger blocks what I do sometimes and what a lot of other people do.  It's hard to not be angry.  It's a blocker.  But the way they do it, you get the point. 
[01:13:30]  They make fools out of the people they're trying to make fools out of.  For them, they kill everybody equally.  They're just great.  But it makes me angry after I see something like that or South Park because those guys,  it makes me hate people, not them.  I love them.  I think they're amazing.  Yeah.  But it makes me hate people so much because literally they're singing brutal songs, some  of them.  Some of them weren't brutal and some of them are brutal.  Thank you.  And there's old women laughing at it. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I'm like, it is possible.  It is possible to sell this to an audience.  To actually make it mainstream.  It makes me hate people because they only accept brutal parody from certain avenues.  Yeah.  You think?  Yes.  Absolutely.  People love in the cartoon.  Or maybe the networks only accept it.  And that's not the fault of the artist.  That's the fault of the networks and the public.  I think people would accept it in other forums, but I think for some reason the people that  are in charge are the ones that are scared. 
[01:14:30]  That's possibly.  And only go with the safe way, which is through cartoons, like you're saying.  Possibly.  Or the advertisers.  Yeah, that's true because they accepted it from Carl and they do accept it from stand-ups.  Yeah.  But it makes me hate the companies more.  I think the people in charge of these companies are the ones really fucking enough for everybody.  Yeah.  Radio they don't.  That's for sure.  Radio.  Radio's under the microscope all the time.  Radio sucks.  You slip up and they fucking nail you.  It's so good, dude.  It's so good.  I go, like I said, I go in a couple days.  And then he's coming in Thursday? 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  I mean, even though he wasn't, it didn't matter that he wasn't.  It was still a great fucking piece of work.  I deal with understudies.  Who cares?  Get up there and fucking entertain.  I'm fine with it.  Yeah, if you're the understudy on that one, you're, and the guy was, you know, he didn't  miss anything, obviously.  And it turns out these understudies only get maybe, sometimes they never get on the stage.  Well, this guy's had a couple.  And if they do, it's only a couple tops out of a whole run.  You want that fucker to get sick, I guess.  Right.  Oh, of course.  I know this part.  Of course.  He was great. 
[01:15:30]  You're fucking giving him old mayonnaise on his sandwiches and everything, anything to  get him sick.  Yeah.  So you got a shot up there.  Never ask your understudy to get you lunch.  Nope.  I guess that's probably a rule of thumb.  Nope.  Or anything to drink.  Yeah.  We'll put some shit in there.  Um, I would, if I was an understudy, I would absolutely give him explosive diarrhea.  Yeah, you have to.  Yes.  Starts gurgling and percolating before showtime and you're, you're all fucking ready to go.  You're already warming up your voice.  Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me,  What's the matter? 
[01:16:00]  What was the last musical you went to and did you like it?  What was the last musical I went to, I believe, was, um, was, uh, a Disney production.  Oh, boy.  Of, it could be The Little Mermaid.  Oh, boy.  Or, it was, yeah, big smiles.  Little Mermaid or Beauty and the Beast.  I'm not sure which one.  Was it good?  Um, it's, you know, it's that Disney drivel.  So, it's all those little songs and fucking lots of very expensive sets and shit like that. 
[01:16:30]  I think it's a...  I went alone.  It was just something I felt I wanted to do.  I, uh, no, actually, girls will always drag you to those things, eh.  I went to that Jekyll and Hyde with, um, uh, Sebastian Bach.  Wow.  That was the last show?  You friends with him?  A long time ago.  No.  Has he ever done our show?  I don't think so.  Maybe he's good.  I did my Boneyard show.  He's fucking hilarious.  An animal.  Oh, we've had him on.  He's crazy.  We did, I think we did phoners with him.  He's a great guest. 
[01:17:00]  And he was...  I saw him in Rocky Horror.  He knows how to fucking sing.  Oh, yeah.  That Jekyll and Hyde, it kept my attention.  Oh, the musical.  I thought you meant the restaurant and you went with him.  I'm so...  Oh, oh, no, no, no.  I swear to God, that's why I said you're friends with him.  We went to Jekyll and Hyde once, years ago, and it got ripped off.  That's where they ripped off his credit card.  That Jekyll and Hyde stole my credit card.  Not the actual credit card, but they got his number.  Yeah.  It was a brilliant scam this guy had.  Oh, you just talked about the scam last week.  Sorry.  A brilliant scam this guy had.  Yeah. 
[01:17:30]  He had a card reader.  A card reader in his little apron.  And he would just zip it with...  And when you'd give him your card to pay the bill, while he's walking from the table to  the register, he would go on his apron, swipe the card in his card reader, and then  I guess when he got home, he'd plug it into his computer, run off a bunch of blanks with  the fucking shit on it, and get the info, and do shit, so...  And you're thinking nothing of it, because your card's out of your hands for two minutes.  Yeah, two minutes.  Who's going to fucking do anything?  So, yeah, he got all that info, and they bought like $800 worth of phone equipment on 
[01:18:00]  it, but Amex, you know, if they're good like that, you call them up and they say,  all right.  I don't even know if the restaurant Jekyll and Hyde is good.  I don't remember.  That was a while ago.  They were trying to do a, and I remember talking to the owner years ago, they were trying to  pull off the Adventurers Club vibe from Disney, where you'd go into the Adventurers Club and  it was like, you're eating, you're not eating, it was pretty much just drinking there, but  there'd be shows going on and weird fucking eclectic people in costumes and things like 
[01:18:30]  that, and they were trying to bring that to New York, but it didn't work.  Jekyll and Hyde Restaurant?  Yeah.  Is that gone?  It's still there?  No, it's still there, but it's kind of like, who gives a shit?  Yeah.  Who goes?  I went years ago when I first started doing like N.E.W., there was like a fan party there,  like one of those message board parties, that was like 2001.  Got a great beer selection, I'll give them that.  Do they?  Yeah.  I want to go to the, what's the one where they had the fucking Excalibur shit, the restaurant  Medieval Times?  Oh, Medieval Times, we all went.  Is it good or is it terrible?  You know what, it all depends on who you go with, because I went with like Eastside Dave and 
[01:19:00]  shit.  You gotta bring fun people?  It was fucking hilarious.  Dave is just over the top, which, it was absolutely like Cable Guy having Eastside Dave there.  He puts on the crown and he's got a sword.  Oh yeah, it was hilarious.  Where is this place?  This place is in, where is that, Jersey?  Maybe.  Somewhere in Jersey?  Yeah.  Nice work.  And you know, each section gets their own coat of arms to root for, for their night. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah, you go there and you get into the moment, you put on, you go out and you buy like your  beer glasses and fucking crown hats and swords.  Beer glasses, that's what every girl who fucks me is wearing.  Medieval Times.  Medieval Times.  Ah, yes.  And you get into the food.  Is it bad?  Well, you know, you're not really going for the food. 
[01:20:00]  It's just some fucking bad chicken.  Are you doing the get off the couch and do something report?  Yeah.  That's right.  You should go to Medieval Times.  Well, you know, it's funny.  I went and got, I went to Morton's.  Yeah, no, never mind.  And I had a, that's on you.  And I had a fucking big Sunday dessert.  I don't know why I'm thinking of that, but I like a nice meal with a nice dessert.  Ooh.  I shared it with my ex and I went, I had a nice.  You like Morton's Steakhouse? 
[01:20:30]  Love it.  Love Morton's.  Yeah, I like it.  I wanted to, I was going to go to Porter House, which is also amazing.  Porter House.  I went to.  Look at these shoes.  I went to the Morton's here in the city and I'm sitting there.  This was, I guess, last week.  Because it sounds like Norton's.  That's what I like.  Right.  Oh.  And I'm sitting there.  I'm like, why does this place look familiar?  Because I do a lot of steak joints, but I haven't been to Morton's in a while.  And there's a place called Quality Meats.  I think.  I've been there, yeah.  That's a really.  We saw a person with a genetic deformation in Quality Meats, an Asian guy.  His lip literally probably weighed five pounds. 
[01:21:00]  Oh.  And he had a giant tongue.  Ah.  Yeah, he was a disgusting.  People wouldn't be moving their tables.  He sat down and people at the table said, we moved.  Oh, my God.  I felt bad for him, though.  Fuck that.  I'd pull my camera out.  Oh, monster boy.  He just wants to sit and eat.  You should go in the back and just throw it on the grill.  Put your lip on the grill.  You sure it was his lip and not a porterhouse that got stuck?  Dude, it was his.  Eating a whole steak.  It was hanging past his chin and it was fat.  It was obviously a horrible.  Can't you cut that? 
[01:21:30]  You really should.  Do something.  Ow, ow.  I can't.  I hate things.  Medical anomalies like that.  I'm sitting in this Morton's and I'm going, why the fuck does this place look familiar?  I haven't been here in years, right?  Oh, sorry.  My new favorite commercial.  Oh, yeah.  The United Healthcare girl on the surfboard commercial.  Boogie board, actually, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Look at this slow motion ass shot.  She's going by.  And then they slow it down even more, right?  Yeah.  She's got cheeks.  That's great.  For United Healthcare.  You know what they're selling there, right?  Ass.  Young pole. 
[01:22:00]  Young fucking ass.  They want you to look at her.  Well, she's a pretty girl.  She's going by and everybody's hoping that you look from her legs up to her.  Pussy.  The violent way you say that is the best.  So.  Yeah, sorry.  I'm in.  I don't give a fuck.  So distracted.  I'm in Morton's and I'm going, why is this place looking familiar?  And it finally hit me.  It was the place that Dice caused the fucking scene.  With the butterfly fucking steak that he made. 
[01:22:30]  Where he had the whole restaurant just looking at his steak on the grill.  Because the grill's right there.  Yeah.  They cook the steaks pretty much right in the room with you.  Do you remember when I asked you, I want my potato grilled.  So I'm telling the story to the people that I'm with.  How many times did he.  Send it back.  Send it back.  Oh, my God.  The steak three times with the potato a couple times too, right?  It was awful.  Yeah.  It got to the point it was embarrassing for everybody.  It went from funny. 
[01:23:00]  It went from he had a real problem to it's funny to I just want to leave.  This is really embarrassing.  Yeah, it's really embarrassing and uncomfortable.  And they're going to spit in all of our food.  What day did you go?  A couple Fridays ago.  Oh, okay.  And yeah, at one point they had everyone in a circle around the grill staring at Dice's steak  as they try to cook it properly for him.  Because like 10 seconds plus or minus was too much or too little.  For Dice.  Right.  Like it had to be done perfectly.  And it was funny because when he walked in there, obviously very recognizable guy. 
[01:23:30]  There's a whole bunch of us.  It was at least 10, 12 of us.  Yeah.  Big group.  And everyone's excited.  Dice is at Warren's.  Oh, my God.  It went from excitement to they hated him by the end of that.  They're like, I don't care.  He's recognizable.  Yeah.  He's driving us nuts.  And I think that's what Dice was going for that day.  Oh, yeah.  I think he was.  Absolutely.  I think he decided to just fucking be a good boy.  Absolutely.  The bread.  The fucking place is amazing, man.  I had a medium well filet mignon. 
[01:24:00]  And you can't not eat the bread.  The hot fucking onion bread.  You can't not.  You like medium well?  Yes.  I like well.  What's wrong with you?  Always.  Medium.  Wow.  No, I like it medium well.  Because when they cook medium well.  Do you like your pussy like that, too?  No, I like my steak the same way I like my pussy.  With all grout and potatoes next to it.  No, I like it medium well.  I don't like rare meat at all.  You need a little pinky on the other.  No way, man. 
[01:24:30]  I like it.  Chard on the outside.  No, I like chard on the outside.  But I like a rare steak.  I don't.  Not rare.  Not rare.  Too chewy.  It's medium rare, but I slice it real thin.  Oh, it's hard.  I don't live on the Serengeti.  I don't need fucking.  I don't need fucking.  What, I like the hoof on the thing, too?  I like it nice and medium.  But when they cook medium well, it really is just medium well.  They don't ruin it.  They don't ruin it.  Yeah, you can't.  I don't know.  I like it a little fucking on the rarer side. 
[01:25:00]  I just want to get off my ass and do something.  Oh, Jesus.  No.  All right, we'll play this.  Oh, no.  Oh, come on.  So I had references last week.  It's the Get Off the Couch and Do Something Report.  This goes back to WAAF, the only station that really rocks.  Jesus Christ.  It could be.  This could be 15 years ago.  This is probably, yeah, 15 fucking years old.  That's the only excuse we got.  That's the only one there is.  Dave Douglas, the PD, made me do this fucking segment where I had to go through the fucking 
[01:25:30]  local rag and find where bands were playing in Boston and announce it to the people.  He wanted us to do segments.  Segments.  He was a big segment guy.  Fuck you.  We'll make sure the oranges are all stacked nice.  Yeah.  Last I heard, he was working at a supermarket.  Yep.  Oh.  Opie and fucking Anthony.  Motherfuckers.  We drove him nuts.  Yeah, I'm running the produce section here at the supermarket. 
[01:26:00]  Things are going real good.  I don't know if he's really working at a supermarket.  I heard it got so bad, he was a greeter.  A greeter.  At a supermarket.  I heard that.  I don't know how true it is.  I know he had a very religious wife that hated us.  Yeah, and I think that affected what he did with our show.  Yeah, there was some conflict there.  Right, because you go home and the wife says, hey, what's that?  You know, you're on a station that, you know, your name is attached to a station that does shit like that. 
[01:26:30]  That's all I was imagining when he went home.  Well, we were the only station that really rocks.  Why would you say shit like that?  And that song by Live, where the fetus hits the floor, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  This was back in...  The placenta falls to the floor.  Placenta, excuse me.  Thank you, man.  This was back when you could get away with a lot on the radio, way before God, as PC as it has gotten.  Oh, you just play the who and let him say, who the fuck are you?  All that shit.  And it would go right through.  But we're on this, like, rocket station. 
[01:27:00]  It was supposed to be really edgy.  And, yeah, he had an edit made.  An edit made.  So the whole first verse to Lightning Crashers by Live was cut out.  And then it started with the second verse because he didn't like the whole the placenta falls to the floor was, like, a little too...  And that was personal taste because every other station was playing it the way Live meant it to be.  And, you know, it's so fucked up about how, like, we... 
[01:27:30]  I was embarrassed by that.  And we never spoke of it, really.  But the other stations, like, why wouldn't BCN, some of the personalities, have jumped on that and called us faggots or pussies or whatever?  Like, that's because that's what we did and wound up, like, winning in the ratings over those stages because we would have jumped on that shit.  Why? Because those guys were faggots and pussies.  Pussies.  Yeah, I don't know. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah.  But Dave Dickless made us do this segment because it was, like, the one thing, I think, that was ever sold on our show, sponsored.  Yeah.  So I had to do it.  I remember I skipped it once and he really got mad at me.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  God, I don't remember any of this.  Had to do it at 6 o'clock on the nosy.  And he, I skipped it one day.  I was just like, you know what?  Fuck this.  I don't give a shit.  I don't remember this at all.  And he's like, you know, that's part of your job.  You have to do it.  I was like, shut up.  Shut up. 
[01:28:30]  Have some pride.  Have some pride.  Boys down at IBM want these.  Have some pride.  Yeah.  They expect to see the Captain Hook uniform.  Have some pride.  Have some pride.  That Captain Hook uniform represents.  That boss was an asshole.  The same type.  Oh, God.  Look, there he is.  What is that picture of?  Dave Douglas.  Let me see.  Sex Man found it.  But who is he with?  He's with Kid Rock.  Oh, that's Kid Rock?  Amazing.  How people find this shit. 
[01:29:00]  That's Kid Rock before anyone knew who Kid Rock was.  It's one of those FMQB, you know, in history.  Yes.  Well, there's Dave Douglas.  Stupid mustache.  Was he a big guy or no?  I just want to punch him.  Mustache is a little worm.  Mustaches are starting to come back for some reason.  But I just lived through the whole phase where it didn't.  And I'm going to shave mine when it comes back.  I'm a rebel.  Mid-90s, it certainly was not the thing to be wearing.  No, it was all about the goatee during the 90s. 
[01:29:30]  But Dave had just a regular 70s porn mustache.  Yes, indeed.  And trying to work for this hip rock station.  Oh, he was the worst, man.  Sorry, Dave, but you really were.  God.  Was he unpleasant to work for?  I can't even spin it 15 years later.  He had no way of communicating with the bands.  Thank God for John Osterlin, the Ozone that worked there.  Yeah, Ozone was great.  Because there was just no one that could communicate with the bands and the record fucking guys  that would come around and shit.  Who's all that?  Who was that? 
[01:30:00]  That's him.  With Dave Mustaine and I guess record people.  Oh, I see.  Is that Mustaine right next to him, right?  Yes.  I never realized how young Dave was.  I was picturing him as the old fuddy-duddy guy.  He wasn't all that old, was he?  He was probably only a few years older than us.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah, probably.  We were faking our age, though.  Oh, well.  You guys were pretending you were younger?  Man, we had to be fucking rocking.  We weren't married.  We didn't have girlfriends.  We were fucking 10 years younger than we were. 
[01:30:30]  It was just the worst.  But they told us to do this shit.  You know, it's a rock station.  The demo is anywhere from fucking 16 to 22, and we're like...  We need it to sound available.  We're like mid-30s.  It wasn't that bad.  Just fucking...  We need it to sound like we were, you know, going out every night, boozing it up, which  I was, but...  You know, hitting the clubs.  And we had to bring our broads to the parties.  Oh, God. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, God.  Some of those fucking gigs, though.  Wow.  Oh, Club Cadillac.  All right.  Fucking Kahlua Girls at Club Cadillac.  I'm fucking just drunk in make-out session with some chick with braces.  She had fucking braces.  Do you want to fuck her?  Oh, did I ever want to fuck her.  It's one of my favorite stories of all time.  The day we said no to skinny dipping.  To skinny dipping.  With 19-year-olds.  With fucking a chick. 
[01:31:30]  19 and 20-year-olds.  Kahlua Girls with braces.  Who said, I quote, we're getting some beer and we're going skinny dipping.  We're going skinny dipping.  Are you guys in?  Why didn't you just go?  And we said no.  No, I have to get back to my wife!  We said no.  Jimmy, we said no.  One of the biggest regrets in my life.  Absolutely.  Right there.  Never saw her again, did you?  Nope.  And it wasn't like there was a lot of email or things where you could go, look.  No, there was nothing.  It was done.  But no one would have blamed... 
[01:32:00]  Game over.  No one would have blamed us.  Our relationships were shit.  Even if they were great, I wouldn't have blamed you.  They were in the shitter then.  I was such an idiot.  I should have fucked her.  I should have went skinny dipping.  I should have.  I'd love to go with you.  What did I do?  Yeah, well.  They might have been...  The bathroom.  The toilet.  Standing in the toilet tank.  Yeah.  We used to have one foot in the tank, one foot in the ball, just jerking each other  off and kissing.  Like holding onto each other's shoulders so we don't fall. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, it was just skinny dipping.  And when you're about to come, I'll reach into the septic tank and splash water on you  so you'll feel like we're frolicking.  Come while we frolick.  Oh, that is an awful, awful picture you painted.  Holy shit.  I love when the skinny dipping story comes up.  It's one of my favorite things ever.  The day we said no.  And they were hot.  They couldn't have been more.  Maybe 20.  Yeah, yeah.  Maybe.  Dude, they were so hot.  Maybe.  Remember we were thinking about, well, we'll go skinny dipping and then I'll just dump 
[01:33:00]  my fucking truck in the lake.  Yeah, we actually were saying maybe we can drive the truck in the lake and say that we  lost control of the vehicle.  Like this was a viable option.  And that way we could be wet and not.  Would it have gotten you like, did your chicks know you were supposed to be back by like 10?  They knew we were at a gig.  They were together waiting for us to show back up. 
[01:33:30]  They knew we were at a gig and they knew, you know, girls were at these fucking gigs and  they were constantly jealous.  They were on high alert to begin with.  Always high alert.  If we came home stinking of some fucking swamp and pussy at the same time.  Massachusetts fucking swamp and yeah, vagina and nice fucking 20-year-old vagina smell.  Imagine that fucking braces, lips on your dick though, looking up, seeing him kiss your  balls.  I know.  Please, believe me.  Who says no to skinny dipping with 20-year-olds when you're in your mid-30s? 
[01:34:00]  Oh, I know.  Oh, God.  What a fucking dummy.  You regret that one, don't you?  That was one of the biggest regrets of my life.  How was her body?  It was stunning.  She probably would have kissed you while she fucked you.  It was stunning.  She probably would have wrapped her legs around you.  Yes.  And she probably would have said, look, I'm not 20.  And as you were ready to come, she probably would have said like, what now?  As I'm ready to come, what now?  I'm a lot younger.  Don't tell the people that Kahlua because, you know.  Yeah, her lips would have tasted like cherry or something from her little lip gloss. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, lip gloss.  And obviously those relationships we had were ending.  Yeah.  They were going to end.  Oh, my God.  Well, I guess at that time, to be fair, I didn't know it was going to end yet.  I did at some point.  As you were fucking about to come, she would have coughed.  And then she would have just forced out diarrhea shit all over your balls.  And then diarrhea shit all over your fucking big low hangers.  It would have ruined the fucking moment.  It would have wrecked everything. 
[01:35:00]  Do you remember when we went to, I don't know if I've ever told this story on the air.  Maybe I have, but it's been a long time.  Remember the time we went to, I think it was Ten's Show Club?  Ten's Show Club.  Is that the one right over the border that we used to go to every once in a while?  Yeah, I think so.  Remember we went as a group?  And my chick at the time, extremely jealous.  Yeah.  Extremely jealous girl.  But she says, yeah, let's do this.  This will be fun.  Yeah.  It's a whole bunch of us. 
[01:35:30]  A bunch of couples.  There's probably a bunch of other people from the radio station.  We're at a gig somewhere close to Ten's.  And we're like, yeah, let's go.  Well, you know, they treat us nice there.  We'll drink for free and all that.  And so I'm at Ten's Show Club.  And of course, I started looking at the girls.  Of course.  She gave me this look of death.  I'm like, what the fuck am I?  So I remember just staring at beer taps.  Oh, God.  Because I didn't want to deal with it.  So you couldn't even look at the girls? 
[01:36:00]  No.  That's wonderful.  I'm like, why are we even here then?  Great relationship.  Why are we even here?  And then I remember I'm at the bar.  And then I'm staring through beer taps.  And then I'm trying to get glimpses either through the beer taps themselves or kind of look over.  But in all fairness, I didn't want to deal with it.  I'm like, why are we here then?  You agreed to come in here.  Now you're mad because I'm looking at the naked girls.  Are you kidding me?  Believe me.  None of this shit made sense to me. 
[01:36:30]  Back then, it was just like.  Because then all you had to say was, look, I feel uncomfortable.  I don't think I want to do this.  All right.  I probably would have said, all right, we'll go do something else.  But she agreed.  I was always on the verge of getting laid back then.  And then the dumb fucking wife would get in the way.  Dude, you're the greatest.  I know these are old stories.  I apologize.  But they're great stories.  And maybe there's people hearing them for the first time.  Anthony.  Oh, my God.  We had maybe. 
[01:37:00]  Maybe they were 17.  17 year olds in the rock bus.  Oh, God.  That fucking one was great.  This girl was 17, just built for sex, this one girl.  And then her friend that was a little frumpy, but she had youth on her side.  So she was all right, too.  And Ann gets the brilliant idea to make them do fucking headstands without panties on.  Yeah, that was my old ploy.  And then remember we started making. 
[01:37:30]  We started drawing on them with Sharpies.  And we were writing all over their tits.  And the girl took her top and bra off, and she had, we just, we both just went like,  oh.  They were amazing.  They had 17 year old cones.  Well developed.  Yeah, yeah.  They were big and fucking.  And we started drawing nips.  Bullseyes on their nipples and smacking ass.  Because guys were coming and going.  We were at a gig.  Yeah, we were at a gig at the time. 
[01:38:00]  We just locked the rock bus door.  And our fans at the time, they're like, where's ONA?  Hey, we're at the back fucking drawing bullseyes on these girls' boobs.  And they're like, what the fuck?  When are you guys coming out?  We're like, we'll be out in a minute.  Relax.  And I was, I, again, I wanted to take the girl back into the, you know, the back room  that had the door.  That's where we broadcast it from.  Yeah, yeah.  I wanted to go back there and fuck that girl.  But again, the dumb wife.  Do you regret the Kahlua girl or her more?  I regret every fucking minute of my marriage. 
[01:38:30]  There were a few opportunities we had up there.  There were so many.  Because the station, you know, catered to the young, man.  Yeah.  And these chicks would come up and they're all just goofy.  And we were the hottest show on the channel at the time.  And we were rocking.  Channel.  It's a radio station.  We were saying things like, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Would you, Matt, it would have been great if you were licking the braces girl's pussy  if she was sitting on your face.  And like, as she was about to come, she would say, oh God, you make me feel even better  than Raheem.  Oh no, I wouldn't like that, Jimmy.  That would be wonderful.  I don't think I would have liked that.  Yes, if you had a nice interracial seed dripped in your face. 
[01:39:00]  It was Boston, so the odds of that happening.  Please.  She obviously was angry at somebody.  What better way to get back at mother and father in Boston?  It's great.  That and she had a Yankee hat on.  But this girl was nice.  She's like, like this?  And she's doing headstands without panties on.  And then spreading her legs.  It was fantastic.  And then they were wondering when we were going to step out of the rock bus to go.  Oh no, we are a motherfucker.  We look at, it's just a dick fest outside.  That's what I want.  I want to talk to some fucking asshole outside about Rage Against the Machine. 
[01:39:30]  And there's fucking hot nymphs in the rock bus.  That we were too scared to just say fuck it.  To close the deal.  Why did we just say fuck it?  Too scared to close the deal.  I wasn't even married.  It wasn't even going to cost me anything.  Too scared to close the deal.  I have a theory.  Because you're dummies.  That's why you didn't close the deal and fucking put loads all over.  Some guy wrote before.  He goes, well the reason you didn't do it is because your wife would have gotten some scumbag lawyer and taken you to the cleaners. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, wait.  Yeah, but if she got you then.  Back then, that would have been fucking beautiful.  You could have taken that hit easier.  Hey, take a percentage of my fucking $40,000 a year I was making.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And I would have had braces, fucking girl.  That would have been fantastic.  I was making out whether my tongue was hitting her braces.  It was great.  Fuck, it was great.  Oh, my God.  These girls are now... 
[01:40:30]  Smelt like fucking pencil erasers and bubble gum.  Those girls are now in their 30s.  Wow.  Even the young ones.  The young ones are now 30.  30 to 30.  Holy shit, wait a minute.  That fucking 17-year-old in the rock bus is like 32.  Has to be.  Yeah.  Wow.  Wish we would have given her a horrible memory.  I wonder if there's any pictures of a Kahlua girl from Cadillac.  There might be.  There probably is.  We used to see the Kahlua girls here and there after that, but they already knew we were 
[01:41:00]  not goers, so they never even tried after that.  Yeah.  They gave us our one shot.  We said fucking no.  We said fucking no.  We could have always said yes after that.  You know.  No, they moved on.  Regret is a horrible thing to have.  That's right.  All right.  Anyways.  I actually saw one of the Kahlua girls.  Remember the shorter one?  It was like the shorter one.  I was with that tall, the tall one with the straight black hair and the braces, and then 
[01:41:30]  there was a shorter one that was buxom.  She was fucking hot.  I saw her at that fucking place there.  Framingham.  Framingham.  The old train station there.  I forgot the name of that place.  Ebeneezer's.  Ebeneezer's.  I saw her at Ebeneezer's once, and I was with my fucking wife.  And so we weren't even able to talk like we would have, because I would have asked her,  have you seen, you know, whatever the fuck her name was, braces, and, you know, is there 
[01:42:00]  any way, like, I would have tried to find out a little more, where I could get in touch  with her or some shit, but Dummy was there, and I couldn't fucking say anything but, hey,  how you doing?  Oh, yeah, yeah, great.  All right, see ya.  And then, listen, get me a shot of Jack.  Fuck you.  Did you want to get away from her for a minute just to go talk to her?  Yes, Jimmy.  What?  I did.  Here's the, I hate this.  Here's the question.  What the fuck were we scared of? 
[01:42:30]  Without the jokes, Jimmy.  What the fuck were we scared of?  I mean, my relationship, I can't front, was okay, but I knew it wasn't going anywhere fast.  I knew that, like, we weren't heading toward marriage or any of that shit.  It was just kind of one of these relationships that just kind of was okay.  Oh, I know why I didn't.  Why?  It was the marriage thing, because we had been married for maybe five years at the time.  You were definitely, and I didn't want to, you were more miserable than me, so I'm wondering 
[01:43:00]  why didn't you just say fuck it at that point?  Because five years into marriage, and I was the first one out of me and my brother and sister  that got married, and, of course, divorce running rampant in my family and shit like  that, I didn't want to, I wanted to be the one that was like, see, I could do this, I  could make this work, I could do this, and, of course, I hung in there for another four  fuck years.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but not doing those things, God, the hotness. 
[01:43:30]  Who did the, uh, the one, there was one I won't even talk about that was at the actual  station.  Holy shit.  Oh, I know.  She was on my shoulders with her top off outside.  Yeah.  We didn't know.  I had no idea.  We didn't know at the time.  I didn't know until later.  Give me a number.  Just say a number.  It's not as bad as I thought it was.  Oh, really? 
[01:44:00]  Oh, come on.  What are you doing?  It could have been worse.  Minus two would have been perfect for me.  No.  But she looked.  Yeah.  She did.  She did.  Did you fuck her?  What's the statute of limitations?  No, no, no, no.  No, but again, could have.  Should have.  No, she was a young little nymph.  She was crazy.  That might have been part of a TV piece they did on us.  Yeah.  She looked great.  With the asshole with the fucking earring.  Oh, that.  Where is that cock? 
[01:44:30]  He makes believe.  We were.  What did he say?  Danny's even bought a dish now.  Yes.  Hello, Danny.  We weren't.  We weren't media savvy at all.  Even when we were at NAW, we still had a lot to learn.  Now we're pretty fucking aware.  But back then, you know, when someone comes to you and goes, hey, we're going to do a TV piece on you guys.  You're all in and thinking, oh, they're going to just make us look great.  And it was about the it was about the wow stickers that just.  No, we didn't have wow stickers. 
[01:45:00]  We weren't allowed to have it.  So everyone was making homemade wow signs for their cars to see the tits.  Whip them out Wednesday, which we don't talk about as much these days because we do mornings.  But whatever.  It became huge up there.  And the state was trying to shut us down.  The mayor, before he finally got us fired, was fucking pissed.  The state troopers passed.  And local Fox, I think it was, want to do a whole piece on this phenomenon, this wow phenomenon.  Phenomenon, excuse me, with Opie and Anthony.  And he comes in, does his whole piece.  And he shows up with an earring. 
[01:45:30]  That should have been our first sign.  Like, and he's filming, like, tell us about wow.  We're just clueless, like telling the whole fucking thing.  And long story short, the story when it aired was a whole piece about how we're a bunch of fucking dicks and assholes.  And this needs to stop.  And the guy that was kind of hip with the earring and kind of casual clothes now has a suit and looking like a newsman.  Now he's the news guy.  And he's on an overpass over the Mass Pike saying how dangerous this is.  And this needs to stop.  We're like talking with state troopers. 
[01:46:00]  This is the fucking guy.  When the cameras weren't rolling, this chick just happened to be in that day.  And she's doing all sorts of shit.  And this guy's loving it.  Matter of fact, I'm not.  My memory tells me that the guy even got a lap dance from this girl.  He might have.  He got some, you know, something.  And he was loving the whole fucking thing.  And he's just like, yeah, cameras off.  And he's like, guys, this is fucking great.  He's cursing a lot.  Right.  This is fucking great, man.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  You got.  And then he got on the air and it's like. 
[01:46:30]  I'm like, who is this guy?  Where's the guy that showed up?  Is there any way to find that piece online?  God, man, that was ages ago.  That might be a tough one to find.  I don't think anyone has YouTubed that because that was before anyone gave a shit totally  about us where they saved their stuff.  To answer your question from before, what were you afraid of?  Getting caught.  It's literally the argument that will ensue.  It's the fuck.  It's it's.  Well, looking back, it's like, why not get caught?  Because then now we could do whatever the fuck we want. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  But.  Yeah.  You don't look at it that way when you're in a relationship.  No, you look at it as a very.  A lot of stress, a hassle, pain in the ass, fucking like now what?  OK, I got to move like somewhere else.  I got to find a place because the marriage is over.  I got to go through divorce.  I got to get it just wasn't it wasn't worth the fucking bullshit.  But but it was.  Now I know it was.  I should have.  I should have just been a fucking monster. 
[01:47:30]  I guess the guys are thinking about it.  Just do it.  Because.  Yeah, guys, this is a lesson for you.  I mean, very good, I'll be a lesson, gentlemen.  If you're thinking about it, do it because eventually your your relationship or your marriage  will be over because you're thinking about it means that there's a problem.  And if you're really thinking about it to the point where you can do it, then there's  a problem.  So just do it.  But you have everyone thinks about it.  No, no.  I mean, think about it to the point where you would where you want to do it. 
[01:48:00]  You will do it.  The only thing stopping you isn't love.  If it's the pain in the ass and hassle, that then is a problem.  Imagine those little legs wrapped around you, those fucking braces legs wrapped.  I mean, I really like fucking Forrest Gump.  Exactly.  Braces legs.  Fuck her magic shoes off her.  I love polio girls.  Braces legs.  I'll inoculate you, whore.  Dude.  Spray Kahlua on her back.  You would ache with temptation.  And then I remember going back, just staring at the ceiling at night going, fuck, fuck, 
[01:48:30]  fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.  We had to hide.  Me and that girl had to hide, like at Club Cadillac.  No, you hit behind a Budweiser banner.  Yeah.  You made out with her.  It was Budweiser and Kahlua girls.  Yeah.  And I think the bottom, obviously it was a banner, so you saw our legs like right there  facing each other.  It was pushing this big honk against her.  I was fucking, I think I was dry humping her.  Did you have a rod?  Yes! 
[01:49:00]  I think it's-  A kissing rod.  You know what that's like?  I do.  I think it's time to write books because I think we can write one book just on our AF shit.  I know we can.  Holy moly.  Tell me about it.  Because then you got the parking lot incident.  Wow, kissing rods rule.  They really do.  And didn't you have kissing rods?  Yeah, really kissing rods rule.  No, not kissing rods.  Kissing rods rule.  We had the parking lot incident. 
[01:49:30]  That is a bad line to have on tape.  Didn't you come close at the cake, when you were doing the cake stands?  Ah, at the college.  At the college, at the sorority house.  At the fucking-  I didn't get to go to that one.  Yeah, that was another one.  I think I actually did get in trouble for that.  How did you get there by yourself?  Ah, fucking bitch was probably with her mom.  But how'd you get there?  I don't remember that one.  I think I drove.  But what was the logic that you ended up in a sorority house doing cake stands with 18-year-olds?  It was a bunch of guys that were just like, dude, we're huge fans of the show. 
[01:50:00]  You gotta come down.  I think it was at Ebeneezer's again.  I was down there.  And that's where everything started.  And guys were just like, dude, I'm in this huge party down at the college.  Come on down.  And I was like, all right.  So I went down there.  And it was just like naked broads and fucking keg stands, funnel shots, all kinds of shit.  And yeah, there was some shenanigans going on there.  But again, didn't close the deal.  Because you got home really late.  Yeah.  And I remember she was pissed.  Oh, yeah.  Thank God there wasn't a lot of cameras around back then. 
[01:50:30]  Because people would have just been snapping pictures.  Hey, here's Anthony behind the butt banner.  Here's Anthony with his feet up on the fucking ceiling doing a keg stand.  You know how good that fucking ass cheeks would have felt as you were fucking squeezing our ass cheeks?  Oh, well, I got to squeeze the ass cheek over the pants behind the beer banner.  But boy, did I want to just fucking ravage.  Couldn't go skinny dipping.  Imagine that.  She's all shy taking her little, because they were wearing the Kahlua with those little short skirts. 
[01:51:00]  It's like, oh, I hope you don't mind.  I'm not wearing panties.  Oh, I don't mind.  Then you hear like an accordion-ish noise.  And you go, what was that?  And she's like, sorry, my fat pussy lips tumbled out of my underpants.  That's why you hear the Irish accordion.  Those were crazy times, man. 
[01:51:30]  There's a few more stories.  How can you sit there and regret something from 15 years ago?  I understand it.  It's crazy.  There's a couple more stories I'm still not brave enough to tell.  Oh, boy.  One of these days.  You've got to bust a couple of those out every so often.  I got new stories.  Yeah.  For another day.  Yeah.  For another day.  Another day.  We're worried.  All right.  All right.  15 years ago.  We were at the uncool portion of what we were doing.  You were going to play.  Yeah.  I was going to play. 
[01:52:00]  Hey, Charlie Callis.  You guys used to call each other those words all the time.  Hey.  It's the get off the couch and go do something report from 15 years ago.  Submitted by Kevin from Connecticut.  Kevin from C-O-N-N on Twitter.  Thank you, Kevin.  Thanks, asshole.  I think he did a recap slash report.  I think what this clip is us talking about this last week.  And then he put a little something together because he kind of likes doing a little production himself.  Yeah, he certainly does.  Why don't you do a segment every day? 
[01:52:30]  Okay.  So, yeah.  I remember this.  This was only a couple days ago.  It was talking about the get off the couch and do something report.  Back in the day.  And I was imitating Dave Douglas telling me what to do.  Here's the setup.  Why don't you do a segment every day at 6 o'clock about what's happening at the local club scene?  I was going to sit there and mention shit, Boston fans.  Did he actually say that?  Hunker Bunker.  I don't remember.  Remember that?  The get off your ass?  Oh, the get off your ass report.  The get off your ass report.  It's like get off your ass and go do something. 
[01:53:00]  And he made me go through the fucking local rag.  I forgot.  And name like, hey, running with scissors is going to be at the rat tonight.  Great.  I forgot.  Fucking blow me.  What a fucking asshole.  Sucked.  You mean like this?  Hey, it's time for the get your ass off the couch and go do something report.  Here's my buddy, Dad Dog.  Thank you, Pap Pap.  And you know the get your ass off the couch report is brought to you by the Worcester Centrum Center. 
[01:53:30]  Nice.  And UMass basketball.  Why is the Worcester Centrum nice?  It's not.  Nice.  I don't know.  Why is it nice?  Nice.  Why, you asshole?  It's not.  I'm talking to my old self.  Why?  It's not nice.  Why do you need to go nice?  Why?  It's a rockin' place.  It's a rockin' place.  You know what?  Before they get your ass off the couch report is brought to you by the Worcester Centrum Center.  Nice.  UMass.  What's nice about that?  I think it's a rockin' place and you're rockin' guys.  Nice. 
[01:54:00]  And this is why I know I will never come in possession of a time machine.  Why?  Because if I would, I would have gone back and as I was standing at Club Cadillac making  out with that girl, I would have looked up and I would have poked out from behind a tree  of something as me now just going, Anthony, it's me.  It's you.  Time machine.  Do it.  Fucker.  Do it.  Fucker.  Fucker.  And then, so obviously it never happened. 
[01:54:30]  But then you fast forward.  All of a sudden she has a kid.  Let's just say you knock her up.  Uh-huh.  And she sees fucking dollar signs.  And so now you're married.  Oh, boy.  And some kid with braces has a baby even though she knows it's going to be profoundly retarded.  Jesus.  Fetal alcohol syndrome.  But she knows that you're going to have to take care of it.  And you have a baby with her that is profoundly retarded.  Who is now 15 with the mind of a three-day-old. 
[01:55:00]  And he's running around your nice mansion knocking everything open.  All over.  Knocking everything over.  Knocking everything over.  Just a profoundly retarded 15-year-old I would have.  He eats the corners of your furniture like George the Animal Steel.  Everything Angie buys you he eats and urinates on.  He thinks the world is a giant toilet.  Jesus Christ.  Well, how many...  You make a good point.  How many just young, supple breasts did we have in our left hand? 
[01:55:30]  Oh, as we signed with our right.  Yes.  As we signed with our right.  Because that's how you sign a boob.  Did you sign my tit?  Oh, yeah.  Ka-chung, ka-chung, ka-chung.  The tit was like...  Ka-chung, ka-chung, ka-chung.  There was no tit falling over the sides.  Like trying to hold mercury.  We get to fucking NEW and it was like, could you sign my tit?  Like one of those fucking party favors.  Like a fucking whoopee cushion.  Like a deflated whoopee cushion we're signing. 
[01:56:00]  Ugh.  Back then it was...  Ka-chung, ka-chung, ka-chung.  So firm.  It was like...  Boom.  Boom.  Boom.  You could just hold it and go...  Boom.  It had a frequency.  Speaking of nipples...  I was going to tweet this last night.  I was mortified, but I'll say it now to you guys instead.  I'm in bed with my kid trying to get him to sleep and I'm watching the Mavs game.  I don't acknowledge that the Heat are playing too, but I guess I have to.  And my kid discovered my nipples. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, no.  Started poking at him with his finger.  And then he grabs my nipple with his two fingers and he's trying to pull it off my body.  You go, stop!  Stop!  And then the other day while I'm feeding him, he pulls up my shirt and starts poking at  my belly.  These kids notice everything.  What the hell are they doing?  I think...  Why?  I think I'm in okay shape and my kid is telling me, uh...  Uh...  Saying, what do you got going here?  Lose weight.  Yeah, but he's yanking at my nipples, like, trying to pull them off my body. 
[01:57:00]  That's, uh...  That's fucked up.  I can't...  I guess if my chest was a little flatter, maybe he wouldn't know.  He obviously has noticed that I have fucking...  A little too much going on, I guess.  Like, mommy.  No, because that's what my wife said.  You're, you know, lucky he didn't try to suck him.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  No, he was violently trying to pull them off my body last night. 
[01:57:30]  I'm like, this is fucking embarrassing.  Yeah.  No one else is in the room and I'm embarrassed.  Then I had to cover myself up all, like, fucking...  I was embarrassed and pulled the covers up so he doesn't pull up my nipples anymore.  That's embarrassing.  Yeah, it's just covering shit.  All right, back to this.  Oh, right.  And you know the get-your-ass-off-the-couch report brought to you by the Worcester Centrum Center.  Nice.  UMass basketball versus Maryland at the Centrum, uh, February 15th on sale.  This Saturday at 10 a.m. in person at the Centrum Box Office.  I called Tiki Master. 
[01:58:00]  Okay?  Tonight, come on.  What?  What's wrong with that, Jimmy?  Tiki Master.  It's called Tiki Master.  Okay.  See, it was like Tiki Master.  It was Ticket Master, but I said Tiki to make it all fun and cute.  Oh, God.  Choo-choo.  Tiki Master.  Okay?  Tonight, come on.  The place to be.  It's the Roxy.  C-O-C, another society.  Handsome.  They're going to rock.  Another society was in here before.  Cool guys.  Very cool guys. 
[01:58:30]  And their music rocks.  I'm looking forward to drinking with those boys in a little while.  Yeah.  What?  Jesus Christ.  Why?  You wanted to drink with the boys in a little while.  That's fine.  Holy shit.  I didn't even go out.  I didn't even go out.  I didn't even go out.  You weren't going to go drink with those boys in a little while?  We didn't go out.  Maybe on the weekends.  I didn't go out.  I guarantee I didn't drink with those boys.  But you didn't want to say I'm looking forward to seeing those guys?  I'm trying to have this rock image all the fucking time.  Oh, God.  I hate myself. 
[01:59:00]  Cool guys.  And their music rocks.  I'm looking forward to drinking with those boys in a little while.  Yeah.  If you're up.  I went home to my cats.  My girlfriend that obviously didn't fucking want to be there.  Unlucky enough to get there and they're sold out.  Oops.  Go to TT the Bears.  See the Mighty Mighty Boston.  They're playing there.  They're cool.  Stallone.  Daylight.  In the movies.  Sleeper.  Good night, Bruce.  Good night, Bruce.  It's our big boss, Bruce Mittman, checking in. 
[01:59:30]  And the Celtics with fleets and a plane.  Terrano.  Terrano.  Terrano.  All right, brother man.  Hey, let's ride down with Ozzy.  Let's do that.  Oh, oh, oh.  Whoa.  See, now when I say brother man, I do it as a joke.  Oh, I can't.  There's no joke behind that brother man.  No, there wasn't.  I can't.  Nope.  Nope.  I'd like to hear that little second part again.  I didn't get the chance to really. 
[02:00:00]  I couldn't have seen that coming.  I, uh.  Well, here's the end again.  Here's the end.  And the Celtics with fleets and a plane.  Terrano.  Terrano.  Terrano.  All right, brother man.  Hey, let's ride down with Ozzy.  Let's do that.  That was me saying, get off your ass, go out and do something.  I don't care what you're saying.  See, that was me.  Because I could care less, but I.  You could hear the conference, though.  Oh, it was all there. 
[02:00:30]  It was all there.  I wouldn't mind doing a gig up in Terrano.  Terrano.  Tiki Master.  Wow, that was, that was harsh.  What's wrong with that, brother man?  And why did Bruce Mimmon stick his head in?  Good night, boys.  Good night, boys.  I'll be listening.  Don't do anything stupid.  Please don't make fun of the fags tonight.  Yes.  While I'm driving home.  I don't want to have to sit with a bunch of fagalos or give them a big check. 
[02:01:00]  So be good, boys.  I'm leaving.  I'm taking my rope ladder to get into my SUV.  And I'll be driving home, sitting on phone books, boys.  Is he still on radio or no?  I don't know.  He's got a consulting firm or something.  I hear from him every once in a while.  He had to drive the biggest fucking SUV.  And he couldn't have been more than five, honestly,  five, five, maybe.  He was a short little feller.  There he is.  Look.  There he is.  He looks like MITCOM. 
[02:01:30]  He runs MITCOM Industries?  Yeah, he does.  Wow.  I actually love it.  That's like Cramerica.  Now looking back, I love that guy.  I know he fucking ripped us off, too, but so many guys ripped us off.  He got his piece out of us.  But I love that guy.  He believed in us.  He really did.  Yeah, he did.  MITCO.  MITCO Industries.  Boy.  MITCO.  Let me tell you.  We're merging with Cramerica. 
[02:02:00]  Please tell me to have a presentation.  We're making oil tanker liners.  Is there a presentation video?  I got to hear Bruce.  All right.  Man.  I'm on Red Eye tonight.  Tonight?  Yeah.  Are you?  Yeah, I'm on Red Eye this evening.  Who are you with?  And don't lie or I'll know.  I'm not sure.  Michaela, the booker, the girl.  Yeah, she's gone, man. 
[02:02:30]  She's leaving.  She's leaving for a political career in D.C.  Thaddeus McCutter.  With Thaddeus, yes.  And we had a party.  They had a party for her Friday.  Went there and had a few beverages with us.  Oh, I wish I would have known.  The wonderful people from Red Eye, which I'll be doing tonight.  Oh, were you in the city?  Yeah.  Oh, I wish I would have known.  It was like a spur of the moment thing.  We were hanging out at home.  And then Melissa was like, want to go to the party?  I was like, eh.  I didn't know about it.  And then, yeah, took the choo-choo in. 
[02:03:00]  You did?  Yeah, because I was going to be doing some of that, what do you call it, drinking.  How was the train?  The trains are pretty civil these days.  Not bad.  Yeah.  You got the new one with the weird seats that make your fucking back hurt?  No.  They can't figure that shit out.  Why can't they have a comfortable chair?  Because fucking seat or whatever.  Degenerates will fuck them up, I'm sure.  They got to make them hose-downable.  Yeah.  You know?  And then I took the subway, which I don't normally do.  Wow, you on the subway.  Subway. 
[02:03:30]  Long Island train's different, but subway for now.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Well, I'll just tell you, there's a little difference riding the subway these days.  A little more confidence, that's all.  You feel better, honestly?  Yeah, I just feel a little better riding the subway.  I'm not bothered by anyone walking onto the subway and sitting down.  It doesn't bother me.  That's pretty much what I'll say.  Yeah, you know.  All right.  Before break, Marcos Yonkers.  Is this your second phone call of the day, Marcos? 
[02:04:00]  Yes, it is, Opie.  You did the drag racing thing earlier for us, which was nice.  Yes.  I was going to say, go away with what you said about your son and noticing things.  Yeah.  I was in Miami Beach this weekend, and I went to take off my shirt, and the first thing  my son goes is, Daddy, you got man boobs, and he starts laughing.  How old is that little fucker?  He's five years old.  I would kick him out of the house.  No, it got me by shock, because I didn't even know.  I didn't even think he knew what man boobs was. 
[02:04:30]  I'm like, where did you hear that?  He's like, I've seen it on TV.  I think that's what my one-year-old was getting at last night.  I cleaned up the story a little bit, but I think he's looking going, hey, hey, I know  I'm a lot of work, but why don't you get back to the fucking gym, pulling out my nipples,  trying to pull them off my body?  Oh, I was going to say, guys, I love all of you guys' Twitters.  I follow you all the time.  Of course you do.  I love all of the videos.  Yes, all of it.  Yes, everything, Anthony.  Why am I being that way to you? 
[02:05:00]  I don't know.  Join the club.  Yes, of course you do.  You and countless others.  We're beloved.  I guess you don't have to officially join Twitter, but definitely check out our Twitter  accounts.  They're pretty good.  Yeah.  All right, Marcos.  Thank you.  Yeah.  And we all do very different things, which makes it cool, too.  Yes.  Yes.  Want to talk to Ed about a subway adventure?  Subway adventure.  Bernard.  Oh.  Hi, sir.  Colin, hello.  How do I not see any headlines today in the Daily News about Anthony Getz? 
[02:05:30]  No, everything was nice.  Everyone was very pleasant on the subway.  There were some real drunks at the end of the night.  Well, that's what I was asking about.  You, too.  Yeah.  Were you guys really drunk?  No, no.  Blending in?  Not really at all, to tell you the truth.  Any beer cans rolling up and down the aisle?  No, just drunk, noisy.  And it was mostly white kids, just drunk and noisy, going back to Long Island.  Like, all right, shut the fuck up.  That's called the bridge.  Boo, boo, boo. 
[02:06:00]  That's called the bridge and tunnel crowd.  Yeah, yeah.  You're part of that, technically.  They're just boo, boo, all yelling and drunk and shit.  Who are you on with tonight?  Yeah, right.  I'm not sure.  I have to check.  But, yeah, I'm red, red-eyed.  And you have to stay in the city Friday night.  Friday night?  Why is that?  Because it's Saturday morning.  What's Saturday morning?  Pop, pop, pop, pop.  Yeah, I know.  A little wire paintball.  Yes, we're doing a paintball with the wire cast.  Where's that?  It's somewhere in the city.  It's great.  Where is it? 
[02:06:30]  It's right outside the city.  Right outside the 59th Street Bridge.  Oh, I didn't realize it was in Manhattan.  The Queens.  Is it indoors?  Indoors, yeah.  It's that Van Damme Street paintball.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Van Damme.  Oh, I thought you guys were going in a field.  No, you know, I only played paintball in, not even fields, like woods, forests.  But, yeah, this is the first indoor one.  And I'm sure they have those courses set up, barriers and cover.  It goes 8 to 12, right?  Shit like that.  I got to check the detail.  I think it's 8 a.m. to noon.  It's a really weird time.  You guys going to be shooting video? 
[02:07:00]  By the way, I am putting on my fucking helmet cam for this.  Paintball.  What's that?  That'll be covered in paint in no time.  Oh, I know, believe me, but I got to try it, right?  Yeah, you got to.  I got to try fucking helmet cam on.  Bring a lot of wipes with you.  Yeah, yeah, I'll just fucking wipe it off.  I never played it.  You got to, you wear regular, do your clothes get ruined?  Oh, boy.  No, no, your clothes are fine.  They don't get ruined.  Believe me, wear like heavy shit that covers everything on you. 
[02:07:30]  Your arms, everything.  And hopefully they'll have some protection there as far as chest protection, eye protection,  face protection.  You will go home with welts on you somewhere.  You will have giant fucking welts on you.  Do they have eye goggles and stuff?  Yeah, yeah, you need that.  Take a fucking eye out.  I got to see Jimmy playing paintball.  But, yeah, what you're doing is, yeah, there's type of gun, there's your type of, is that  the place? 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  Okay.  That looks cool.  So it's got like lolly columns that are all fucking covered in big padding.  And then we got some barricades, like some fucking, they look like heavy bag barriers  and inflatables.  Big giant fucking tube-like thing, so it's like you're in a trench.  Yeah, that's pretty cool.  Yeah, right on.  I'll be blasting some motherfuckers.  Let's say protective gear.  Yeah, you get some protective gear.  And I guess the object, like any, capture the flag, where are we going? 
[02:08:30]  You got to go from fucking your team to the other side, grab the flag, get back.  I don't know what kind of game, they'll probably get you guys in a bunch of different games.  Is it attrition?  Is it just wipe out the other side, last man left, death match?  What's the point of this?  It's a charity.  Jamie Hector's charity.  But how did he collect the money?  It costs money, I think.  To join?  To be on a team or something.  Yeah.  You donate to get a team.  Because no one could watch this.  Right.  Yeah, there's no spectator thing going on? 
[02:09:00]  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  I think just to play against them or...  Yeah.  And those guys are all cool, so you probably get to meet them.  Oh, no, it's going to be awesome.  Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.  Pop, pop, pop, pop.  Yeah, we should break.  I'll videotape some.  Oh, boy, do I have to tickle.  What are we doing when we get back?  I guess we'll just figure it out.  We'll go on the fly.  We'll figure it out.  Where's the curse from last night?  I guess when someone curses on TV, it's a big deal.  Is it still?  I guess.  Is it still?  Do we watch enough on the internet and shit where it's like... 
[02:09:30]  I don't know.  ...in movies and streamable shit where it's just like...  Does hearing fuck really freak you out?  I'm going to fuck a baby.  All right, that might be a little harsh.  It's a quote.  I'm quoting something.  Yes, of course.  Quoting something I saw recently.  Yeah?  Really?  A musical.  Oh, wow, really?  Okay, that's...  They go brutal.  Yeah.  Wow.  It's good for them.  I can't wait.  Wednesday.  The words, they don't play fucking games.  That's fantastic.  It's great.  Good to hear, right? 
[02:10:00]  Oh, it's great.  All right, brother man.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Sirius XM.  The virus.  The Opie and Anthony Show presents...  Primetime Sam Roberts.  And one question with a guest we couldn't get.  Star of film and television.  Robin Hood star, Christian Slater. 
[02:10:30]  Primetime Sam Roberts here with Christian Slater.  Christian, do you watch Top Chef?  No.  Thank you so much for your time.  My pleasure.  This has been Primetime Sam Roberts.  And one question with a guest we couldn't get on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to another performance of My Thoughts on Life with Andy Rooney.  Regrettably, Mr. Rooney has developed an unsightly goiter and will not be performing this evening.  In his place, please welcome award-winning thespian, James Norton. 
[02:11:00]  I'm Andy Rooney.  I'm Andy Rooney.  Nobody wonders why I complain.  I've been doing it since 1967 on the same show every week.  No one wonders.  People wonder why God hasn't struck me down.  People wonder if I shit my pants occasionally.  Do you ever notice I ran out of shit to talk about in 1971 and somebody's been too polite to fire me? 
[02:11:30]  I must have naked photos of Les Moonves or somebody else at CVS.  And my shoes.  I miss a lot of things about being younger.  Barefoot in the summer.  Remembering to pull down my pants before I defecate.  I miss those days.  Sometimes I sit on the toilet for an hour reading the paper.  And then someone says, your pants are still on, Andy.  And I feel like a silly goose.  This concludes tonight's performance of My Thoughts on Life with Andy Rooney.  Starring James Norton.  The Virus. 
[02:12:00]  Sirius XM.  This is the Odean Anthony Show.  All right.  We got Wienergate.  We got an update on that in a minute.  But first, I guess the MTV Movie Awards were on last night, huh? 
[02:12:30]  Yeah.  That was kind of a who gives a shit.  I didn't even know until they were pretty much over that they were even on.  I was watching basketball and having my, like I said, my kid pull at my nipples.  So I missed it.  Yeah.  That'll do it.  But I guess there was a curse.  And now everyone's up in arms today.  Or are they?  It's.  Jimmy. 
[02:13:00]  Hello, Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Jimmy just strolls in.  Strolls out.  Jimmy multi-tests.  He left the show the other day just to get a picture with Huckabee.  Oh, when it's a picture moment.  When it's a picture moment, he will just leave.  And we don't care.  Trust me.  No, no.  But it's funny for the show to bring it up.  All of a sudden, it's like, where's Jimmy?  Then he comes back 15 minutes ago.  He goes, I had a great discussion with Mike Huckabee.  You got a picture with Mike Huckabee.  When was that?  Thursday or Friday?  Yes.  Mike?  But he was cool. 
[02:13:30]  We were talking about politics, too, which is interesting to hear him talk.  Good guy?  Really nice guy.  I was surprised to, I didn't mean to be out for so long, but I was waiting for him.  I want to take a quick shot, because I have never seen him over at Fox.  And we were just, there was rumors that he was going to run for VP, possibly with Romney.  Not happening.  No, he said no.  I asked him, and he said he would not.  I wonder if the media knows that.  Probably.  I think.  I hope so.  And at this point, everything's still up in the air. 
[02:14:00]  Oh, boy.  Yeah, we're going to get to that in a second.  Oh, boy.  Like, who saw this coming?  Can I say, I like mid-show prep sheet.  That's right.  Mid-show prep sheet starts today.  Oh, boy.  We got a doozy today.  What's that?  Hey, you want you over here?  What am I, a fucking piece of shit over here?  Yeah, hey, hey.  You want this?  Is your prep sheet right there?  I didn't get my mid-show.  Jimmy grabbed your mid-show prep sheet instead of his own mid-show prep sheet.  Oh, Jimmy. 
[02:14:30]  Oh, here's yours.  Go, fucking.  He just threw it in the garbage.  Ha, ha, ha, you ass.  I don't know.  I need that.  Oh, boy.  Wait, before we get to the mid-show prep sheet, which could now be a bit every day.  Oh, boy.  The number one is a doozy.  But it's what we thought?  Yes.  Yeah.  Wait.  Oh, boy.  I just got to play this curse real fast.  Okay.  It doesn't need a big setup.  Some idiot curse.  Thinner.  Thinner.  Thinner.  See, play the curse?  No?  Oh, I die with it in my mouth. 
[02:15:00]  In my mouth.  You never see us.  It's the curse of the white man from town.  He'll laugh.  The white man from town.  The white man from town.  And they're like...  Speaking of which, oh, boy, are we going to be targets Saturday morning.  Oh, my God.  Don't expect a lot of fucking NYU white kids in this fucking event.  Yeah, you think all the black guys are going to be shooting at you first?  Every one of them.  Oh, hells yeah.  The only white guys play with the wire guys. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, hell yeah.  Yeah.  Listen, MTV Movie Awards, this happened.  This is the truth.  Seven years later, we work together again on a movie called Water for Elephants.  And this time he played my lover.  I didn't cut you out.  But I did fuck you.  Nice try at the dump. 
[02:16:00]  But I did fuck you.  That's a good use of the word fuck, by the way.  Usually they don't say fuck you.  Usually fuck you.  Yeah, fuck.  Now, and here's the thing there with that.  It's MTV, first of all.  So it's cable, right?  No problem.  But on regular TV, that would be a problem because it's being used in a sexual way and  not in, like, we had a fucking good time.  Right.  Like Bono, I remember he said fuck.  He dropped the F-bomb. 
[02:16:30]  But they determined that it was more of an exclamation than a description of sex.  But that guy said, but I did fuck you.  Which, you know.  Do you find it ridiculous that it's just on TV, but one channel away could be regular TV  and the other is cable TV?  But if it's on cable TV, it's okay.  But if it's on regular TV, it's not?  Yeah.  Because none of us look at it that way.  No.  We all just got cable.  It's all TV.  We even call it, ah, here, I got cable.  Oh, it's on regular TV.  Look out.  But are they serious that they're still thinking of it that way? 
[02:17:00]  Why is it okay on MTV, but it's not okay on ABC?  Why?  Yeah.  And then why can you say anything on HBO?  Right.  And it's all on the same fucking TV that you got in your house.  One is a subscription-based decision you're making, and one can be gotten by anybody.  I understand, but...  HBO just uses the language freedom that MTV is too scared to be.  But MTV is barely a subscription.  I mean, it just comes with your cable.  But not really the...  Oh, we're thinking more kind of abstract than that. 
[02:17:30]  You gave the very literal business application of subscriber-based, but realistically speaking...  It doesn't make sense anymore.  It's all in the same fucking thing.  It's all blurred.  You don't look at it that way, each individual station anymore.  All right, mid-show prep sheet.  Somebody is finished!  Why don't we start from the bottom, though?  No!  Oh, the bottom.  The sloppy party bottom.  Winnipeg sells 13,000 season tickets for new hockey team in 17 minutes. 
[02:18:00]  That's huge if you're a hockey fan.  Okay.  Good for Winnipeg.  Cool.  Ice cold.  There you go.  Done.  Women claim she woke from dental surgery with a British accent.  We get these stories every once in a while.  Wow.  Madonna had her teeth fixed.  All right, that's interesting.  All right, you're done with that?  He squeezed me tits.  I can't believe it!  I had me molest fixed!  And you know what it was?  It was just like...  Of course she woke up with a British accent if she was having her teeth worked on.  How perfect.  I don't know what happened!  I'm from Connecticut and me fall asleep! 
[02:18:30]  Me fall asleep!  All I know, Ice, I had a good boss phone and a naughty boss phone!  I'm not a boss phone and a good boss phone!  It's this English version!  I can't help it!  I had a good boss phone and a naughty boy's phone!  Jimmy's English accent...  A naughty boy's phone and a good boy's phone!  They're just hammering you!  It's Jamaican English Jimmy.  Irish, they're saying a lot of Irish in there. 
[02:19:00]  No, it's not.  Wait, what do you want?  Do you want a different accent?  Here's the Irish one.  He's got a good boy's phone and a naughty boy's phone!  A naughty boy's phone and a good boy's phone!  That's the one he called his ex-wife in from the White House to get to the president.  My David.  David's got a good boy's phone and a naughty boy's phone!  A naughty boy's phone and a good boy's phone!  Someone has a naughty boy's phone. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, speaking of what?  Wait, we're not there yet.  Oh, no.  No, no, no, no, no.  Because this dope of a woman, Karen Butler, 56, I don't feel different inside at all.  I'm the same old me I ever was.  But basically, she had gingivitis, which prompted her to have all her top teeth and her front  bottom teeth extracted.  Ew!  So then she wakes up to...  She's not speaking English.  She's not used to her new teeth yet.  Nice breath, dick.  Oh, hello.  And then she's being diagnosed with foreign accent syndrome, a medical condition with only 
[02:20:00]  a few dozen documented cases.  Get down.  This isn't a real fucking syndrome.  It happens to you.  It's something inside of you just changes.  And you're not sure why.  All of a sudden, you're talking different.  Happened to me.  After I clipped me toenails.  Yeah, started talking like this.  Well, you say everything up at the end. 
[02:20:30]  I get my accents mixed up.  I don't know who I'm doing.  It's kind of Irish.  I don't know what I'm supposed to be.  It works.  Yes, it does.  Amphony.  Amphony.  Amphony.  It's the third.  The third.  It's the third.  That's that fucking Cockney shit.  That's like English ghetto talk.  Do you know in England they have a soap opera that has been on for 50 fucking years?  What a bunch of dull people over there. 
[02:21:00]  And there's one guy, an original cast member who's been on.  He's still on.  It's called, it begins with a C.  I honestly don't, it's the fucking, the something.  Make your own jokes at home.  Coronation Street?  Coronation Street, that's it.  Yes, everybody knows.  50 fucking years.  Look at these motherfuckers.  And I watched, I watched a couple of moments of it, and there was one clip where the guy  fucking screams at his wife for having an affair.  And I'm like, I would fucking watch this show.  Really?  Good? 
[02:21:30]  The way he screams at her, I'm like, that was a real.  You fucking whore!  It was, uh...  Bloody hell.  No, he was really mad.  She tries to apologize, and he's saying it's not enough.  But it's a real fucking...  It's not enough.  Like, the way I would yell is, that's not enough.  Enough?  With that finger point, too?  Yeah, that's enough.  Sideways, kind of upside down.  It's not enough!  Oh, he fucking told her.  Gave her a talking to?  She was not happy.  Mid-show prep sheet. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, yeah.  This NYPD sergeant files sexual harassment, complaining against his male boss.  Oh, God.  What the fuck happened here, huh?  That's right.  Do you want to...  Fed up with getting unwanted advances from his boss?  He'd call me in for no particular reason.  Then he'll lounge back with his feet up, and he puts a pen in his mouth and starts sucking  on it in a sexual manner.  Oh.  Will you just openly laugh and just leave? 
[02:22:30]  He doesn't say a word to me.  He's looking at my crotch and smiling.  I give him a disgusted look and turn around and walk out.  This guy has no case, by the way.  No.  He doesn't say a word.  He just looks at my crotch and smiling.  It ain't gonna work.  You gotta get some fucking tape of him going, hey, nice cock there, fella.  Well, the complaint also alleges unwanted touching.  Oh, yeah, but on the subway.  The train is not crowded, and he's on top of me rubbing his arm on me.  Oh.  It's all... 
[02:23:00]  And then this guy says, I'm fed up with it.  Everyone in the command jokes around, why don't I take one for the team?  I'm tired of that.  Just take one for the fucking team.  Exactly.  Let him suck your cock.  What?  His little captain's hat falls on your leg.  Oh, what are you gonna do?  This is how smart we are.  The boss.  The boss man, old school NYPD.  The guy with this being, quote, sexually harassed.  Young guy that might be a little, uh, a little, uh...  Confused?  Might be a little confused.  So the fucking boss man is having a little fun with it. 
[02:23:30]  Giving it to him.  That's what this is about.  Yeah.  He's out of the boss man wants to suck his young patrolman cock.  See him late at night at some gay bar, leaning off the bar stool.  Yeah, at the background.  Fucking rolls.  Oh, Jesus.  Is that a crazy scene?  That is crazy.  The gay harassment.  Craig Craig.  The officer known as Keith the Cop was seen staring at the crotches of young recruits.  Ah.  We got another singing sensation. 
[02:24:00]  What?  Girl belts out star-spangled.  Oh, shit.  I said this bitch was gonna be huge, uh, this week by Monday.  She's terrific.  Who is she?  Can you find it online?  She was actually...  I think she's singing right now live.  Right here.  Oh, really?  Yeah, she's one of the kids in The Shining.  Here by the dawn's early light  What so proudly we hailed  At the twilight's last gleaming  Whose bright stripes and bright stars 
[02:24:30]  This is going great!  Through the perilous fight  Be boooooooon!  Oh, hello, Ray!  Oh, thank you for the morning, eh?  Oh, oh, girl!  Gay!  You're so gallantly streaming  And the rocket's regalant  The bombs bursting in the air 
[02:25:00]  No, I didn't mean it that way.  I meant the note was flat.  It broke through through the night  That when our flag was still there  Oh, say does this star-spangled  That's quick, man.  I doubted that shit.  What?  She's sick!  Oh, she's sick!  And whales  Oh, the land of liberty 
[02:25:30]  Boo!  It goes into falsetto mode  And the heart of the brave  Great job, Julia  Back with Julia Dale and friends right after this  Yeah, it was a good job  I forgot if it was hockey or basketball  She sang it before  One of the finals games there  Well, she's 10  Yeah, she's 10  So she can, you know  When you sing like that  That wasn't as good as the one I heard 
[02:26:00]  Make it all look like  Whatever the fuck that was  Mid-show prep sheet  Mid-show prep sheet  And here's the doozy  And we said this was coming  Oh, yeah  We know way more than anybody else  This is a good one  New woman comes forward  Claiming she has intimate photos, chats, and emails from  Jim Norton  That's right  And she's not a woman  From Anthony Weiner  Ah  It's over, Johnny  It is finished  It's over, Johnny 
[02:26:30]  That's why he didn't want to deny that those pictures were his  Because he knew he had sent them to somebody else and there's more  That's what we said  He sent this fucking picture around  Around a bit  Here it is from Breitbart here  A new woman has come forward with  What she claims are photographs, chats, and emails  With Rep. Anthony Weiner  Democrat, New York  These appear to undermine severely  Weiner's explanation  That he was the victim of a prank or a hack  The detailed new information suggests that 
[02:27:00]  The Brooklyn and Queens-based representative  And the young woman in question  Were involved in an online consensual relationship  Involving the mutual exchange of intimate photographs  Biggovernment.com and BigJournalism.com  Were approached regarding this information  More than a week prior to the separate independent event  Of Friday, May 27th  When the link of the now infamous grey underwear photograph  Appeared publicly 
[02:27:30]  On Rip Weiner's Twitter feed  We will be updating BigGovernment.com and BigJournalism.com  Throughout the day with photographs, timelines, and other clarifying details  However, we will not be releasing all of the material  Because some of it is of an extreme graphic nature  Wow!  Why won't they release it?  Is he, John!  Because it's probably fucking boners 
[02:28:00]  Good!  Fucking cum shots  Shit that you can't just put up on fire  Alright, now  He probably writes sexy things to her  Like, I want to kiss your belly  And I want to open your thighs  Then slide my big awful nose  And you're a big  Pussy!  Yeah, you ever been schnoz fucked?  Big schnozola  A dinka-dinka-doo  A stinker-stinka-doo  Everybody wants to get into the pussy

[02:30:00]  all of your fingers like you're picking something up with all five fingers like like a like a  horseshoe crab and you just go like and you and you just and you like grab the helmet like this and  it keeps slipping off the helmet a little horseshoe crab it looks like the thing in the carnival  you're trying to grab the toy oh yeah the little crane thing that you got to grab the stuffed animal  that's how you tweedle with a cock right and you tweedle yeah oh his rep wiener finished wow  wow that is astonishing it was applaud for the republicans to put out these wiener photos why 
[02:30:30]  uh well jimmy why why jimmy because the wiener was the only democrat that had money  a viable candidate for office for mayor don't you realize that  well the photos have to exist for someone to put them out yes are any up yet not yet uh once  they're up they're going to be everywhere john and jersey hit her jan hello anthony you son of a bitch 
[02:31:00]  what you're lying about the six-year-old being flat resulting in me spitting ice tea  but that was that was jimmy that was jimmy i just reiterate it was like a uh fucking abon costello  bit that one i i spit i see him without the drowning kid in the pool i can't ever not fuck uh you spit  your iced tea on the uh windshield eh yeah that's good  in front of me to avoid that 
[02:31:30]  hey we rule we understand thank you sir chris in jersey chris  chris in jersey  i uh i wouldn't say  because i mean people in new york still elect charlie wrangle every time and he's yeah are you  are you trying to get me uh riled up sir is that what you're trying to do what he's saying he may  be able to survive this no charlie wrangle survives because of his constituency they're very uh uh racial  racially based um he's a race baiter he plays the race card uh the the voters will vote him in 
[02:32:00]  based on his skin color alone wiener on the other hand is a white guy uh and white white guy politicians  are open to every scandal black guys get away with it you get uh and not even politicians like  he's a self-anointed and appointed leaders can say hi me town can say something about fucking  president obama and his uh lack of balls or uh what have you and just skates and uh uh reverend al 
[02:32:30]  same thing um marion barry uh but white white politicians uh one scandal you're done look at john  uh uh uh edwards what's his name finished uh yeah done what what jesse jackson said was about obama  he said uh he said uh i'd like to did he decide to rip his balls off yeah yeah he goes he's talking  down to niggers he said niggers and he said rip his balls off and still people go to him for you  know even fox backed off on it they didn't kill jesse like they should have for those comments even 
[02:33:00]  fox they should have nailed him like any other fucking politician or uh spokesperson for any group  would have been nailed what was that debbie gibson again yeah she's here  i'll get a picture with her why isn't debbie coming by she was just here oh really that was a  while ago now that was winter no way her and fucking that was winter when she was here with  fucking yeah it was winter when was that her and tiffany that was uh i would guess uh february 
[02:33:30]  yeah maybe early march no february i would say i was thinking like when you said winter i always  think like december december yeah i'm thinking december but it wasn't i um friday i don't know  how i got to this website january 21st wow january quick with the info all right eric fuck of course  debbie gibson he knows yeah we don't really want her in here that was just a thing eric runs i'll see 
[02:34:00]  if i can get her in nah it's okay if it happens naturally then we'll have her pop in and say hi it  was nice friday thanks though friday i found a website it was um uh they had that air france  crash that they were investigating that crashed into the ocean and shit and i was trying to find  the transcripts to the the flight recorder oh but uh i guess i couldn't find them but i found a site  where they had transcripts to all kinds of flight recorder um from accidents and this was like right  from when they're still at the gate talking to each other and checking systems to the point where 
[02:34:30]  the recorder peters out and it's like reading a short fucking horror story because you you kind  of get to know these people based on like their dumb conversations what two guys are talking about  like the unions and stuff you got one good one we can play like the union no these are uh just a  transcripts they aren't the actual audio i'm sorry but it's like reading a a short story that you  know ends tragically with these two characters uh dying and meanwhile it's real people there is a 
[02:35:00]  uh a couple of guys they're just talking about fucking um uh the union and yeah fucking uh flight  uh uh this director uh is is giving isn't giving me enough hours and just like bullshit and then it's  like you hear a yawn or you hear this and well maybe instead of talking about unions they should  have talked about the flight plan but they did you know what they were they would go running  through system checks and then they're they actually run through a whole thing of what happens if 
[02:35:30]  they do lose power where they'll go this is all like shit that that happened you got one that's  not too long that you can read through you know i really don't they're all kind of long okay and uh  well can't we just get to the end of it and like read the last few minutes well but the whole good  thing is is not a good thing it the build-up makes it more character development yes and i was  thinking that it's like this has character development because most of the time when they play the  transcripts or read the transcripts or play the tapes it's right at the end but this is like the 
[02:36:00]  whole thing so it's the guys and they're flying and they're just yapping with each other and then  you'll hear the beginning of a problem it'll say like in parentheses it'll say like banging noise  and you'll hear one of the guys go got that it's like i think so like and shit like that like and  then strained voice uh hold it hold it keep it you got it you got this one you got it buddy you got  and they're like yelling you got it and then it's like one one of these the fucking plane flew they  couldn't fly it right side up the upside down the plane actually flew think you can fly a plane upside 
[02:36:30]  down yeah if you have enough power and enough angle of attack fucking scared people must have been  it must have been shitting yeah but you can fly the plane upside down with enough power and enough  angle of attack and shit like that but um they tried to roll it back over and the fucking thing  just went into some spin and stuff and the guy's telling him try to get it back on its back are we  flying are we flying and and then you just feel like it's always oh no oh shit my god and then 
[02:37:00]  you sometimes you'll see parentheses screams and then just like end of recording just fuck it it's  it's the most horrific shit i don't know why it's so fascinating flying upside down as long as they  could keep it but even upside down it was hard because they try to roll it back over and then  they were like now let's try to roll it back on its back because at least they'll keep flying 
[02:37:30]  till we figure out what went wrong what was what did go wrong on that plane some hydraulic fucking  problem where they lost control services uh then there's some pilot error ones which are just like  ridiculously that's what they're saying happened with air france by the way just pilot error they  they concentrated on their instruments um or or one of their instruments too much it was showing an  airspeed that would have been normal for an uh uh that air aircraft but uh the the pitot tube that 
[02:38:00]  measures airspeed was frozen the one that was the one that documentary said would be happened yeah  frozen solid so they were getting um a false airspeed reading but their nose was up at 90 uh  90 35 degrees and they were getting a stall warning and they were still pulling back on the fucking  controls putting it even in in more of a stall until they just crashed instead of aiming it down  instead of pull it pushing in getting the nose down so they were just looking at one thing not the 
[02:38:30]  they were looking at airspeed they weren't looking at the artificial horizon they weren't like they  just but these were experienced like pilots three of them in there and none of them figured out that  their nose was way too fucking high it wasn't the pilot it was like the uh it wasn't the captain that  was at the helm like a minute into the the disaster he came on yeah yeah it was the other guy he went to  he went to sleep for a while i was going to take a nap ski and uh yeah the co-pilot was taken over  but then the pilot came in and none of them noticed that they were you know way too far nose up 
[02:39:00]  they got stall warning and then they just slowly kind of you know relatively speaking they didn't  nose dive into the water 10 000 feet a minute a minute three and a half minutes three and a half  minutes of falling and then they just hit the fucking water and that was that but i wonder if  people knew they were falling and not descending i guess oh yeah you're over the ocean at that speed too  it's like plane crash info.com yeah there's a bunch of them some of them actually have the uh  that might have the audio fuck this one sucks oh my god there's a lot of panic like this is the first 
[02:39:30]  one i'm seeing where there's more than because a lot of these recordings i've been looking at  it's just like the last two lines it's like oh no and that's it but this one has a lot of panicking  here let me see no stop stop where where the guy's like fuck he's cursing fuck what are you doing  it's like this was i guess july 4th 2001 uh land of stokavia flight three it must have been a  russian plane aeroflat and crack what's a flat fuck push up push up stop where where stop stop 
[02:40:00]  uh this way this way this way this way we're recovering easy make it easy easy let's let's to  the right oh my god power add thrust power got it add thrust take off power oh my god take off set  that's all guys fuck that's all guys fuck he's just like that's it oh we're done we're done that's all 
[02:40:30]  guys that's his last words that's all guys fuck he knew oh crap oh yeah those are those are uh just  really frightening and the audio ones are even worse if you can find a site that actually has  the audio uh wow brutal but yeah that's a that was my nice friday uh afternoon kind of a thing  i just spent reading horrid transcripts that's crazy let's go to mike in uh utah utah flight  instructor mikey hey how's it going guys um this is one of the things that they make every single 
[02:41:00]  airline every single flight student go through um it's called air crew coordination training if you  look it up online you can come up with a couple different sites that'll have a whole bunch of  videos and audio and they're pretty nasty and it's it's basically designed to scare you to let you  know that if any of your instruments fail this is going to happen and that's what they're thinking  happen to that flight over in brazil yeah you could be you could be rolled over at like fucking 30  degrees with fucking 30 degree nose down and still think you're flying level like your body you think 
[02:41:30]  you think your body would know but it doesn't your visual reference is just to the inside of the  aircraft so to you you're level and unless you have a visual reference like a horizon or something  you're fucked well don't you have a readout on the front that's just it you gotta trust your uh  artificial horizon and your instruments but when your instruments fuck up you gotta look at other  instruments to see if you're indeed stalling if your airspeed's normal like when that airspeed 
[02:42:00]  fucked up uh and and the autopilot clicked off uh they didn't look at their artificial horizon and  realize they're a 35 degree climb well and that's exactly what um they call it partial panel uh instrument  flying and it's part of the emergency procedures that you gotta practice and one of the weird things  like what you were describing earlier is if your pedal system if you get a pedal blockage  your airspeed indicator will actually act like an altimeter so as you're climbing because of the 
[02:42:30]  back pressure in your static system um your airspeed will indicate an increase in airspeed when you're  really not when you're not oh well isn't it isn't there a formula too like a 15 and this percentage of  the uh engine is is the one that will safely fly you if your instruments are fucked up it's like this  percent of a lift and this percent of your engines is the formula to fly with until your  equipment comes back well yes but the problem is is uh most of these scenarios you're in pure imc 
[02:43:00]  conditions instrument meteorological which means you've got no visibility so you have to rely on your  instruments now a lot of the newer systems you've got backups to the backups to the backups to be able  to go to but it's through basically when you fly too much and you get too used to it being the same  thing same thing same thing you don't look at and scan the other instruments to show the failures on  your on your active instruments yeah just look at the old school ones you know i i think some people  are so used to those glass panels now it's like just look at the old school fucking dials 
[02:43:30]  yeah exactly and that that's where your problems falling guys yeah wow these experienced pilots  that's amazing thanks man all right punch it up thanks mike you punching out maybe ah say you should  be saying that i'm punching out leaving everybody else in here yeah so i mean if you're interested in  that kind of thing uh it's all over the web we're gonna i don't know how i fell in there  sometimes like how yeah how did i get here dan weldon's gonna be in here in a few minutes 
[02:44:00]  the indy 500 winner winner winner is anything there uh not yet not yet all right disaster that's  happened to me one time when i was in a cockpit and there was some problems i was just i was just  helping him out yeah and i told the guy pick it up pick it up did he pick it up yeah oh okay  sounds sounds like everything worked out fine it was fine i said your altimeter or something's not  good an altimeter sure sure all right chip we'll break get ready for dan weldon yeah 
[02:44:30]  maybe play one of these uh audio clips if we find a good one yeah we'll figure it out frightening  is that it for uh mid-show prep sheet mid-show prep sheet the big story wiener and uh possible  graphic nude pictures new woman comes forward yes we're a cache of intimate photos we're your wiener  your official wiener station so then it makes sense that that seattle broad that was uh had the ample  bosoms yeah or the ample bosom maybe he was uh doing a little fishing could be through his hook in 
[02:45:00]  the water to see if there might be a little interest there could be maybe he had a trip to seattle that  it was in his future or something right yeah um yeah more as the day goes on with this thing this  thing is about to fucking explode yes all right dan weldon next this is the virus  sirius xm and now the opie and anthony show  all right uh i will be running out for a photo of debbie gibson we had her in here i know i didn't 
[02:45:30]  need it we should give something away for the people that just waited through that long  longish break what should we give away what do we got we got some duke nukem stuff what  you could do uh duke nukem and uh or we still have some steven singer uh gift cards left 
[02:46:00]  how about duke nukem is coming out duke nukem forever for xbox 360 or playstation 3 must be  given away this week yes okay two copies of the new duke nukem forever video game for xbox anyone  play this yet no i i got a uh demo instead of the game i was supposed to get the game what but there  was a mix up but um that sucks i yeah i want to play the game i want to see the babes i want to be  duke nukem saving the the babes why would they give you a demo i don't know somebody's got to 
[02:46:30]  someone messed up that answer fine fine let's just give one of those away we'll save the other one for  another day all right we'll give out one duke nukem forever in stores june 14th rated m for mature  must be at least 18 years old and a listener or subscriber not open to residents of alaska hawaii or  why they don't want to pay the air shipping pay the postage how much does it cost though two  million two million dollars fuck that's a lot but wait there's more duke nukem it sounds like 
[02:47:00]  you're dropping nukes on a guy named duke or something that does sound like that chip  hey we got this uh dan weldon dan weldon indy 500 winner yes that's a pretty prestigious title  well he piqued our interest because he wasn't supposed to win this thing no offense to dan weldon  no and also the guy crashes on the last lap i mean not even the last lap like he saw he could  see the finish line right it crashed it was yeah it was he was in the last turn the last part of the 
[02:47:30]  last turn and then uh that guy crashes and there here comes dan weldon yeah what a story for him  certainly is and he won the indy 500 is he outside ready to come yeah bring bring him bring him on in  why don't we bring him on in yes i think he'd be in faster you know race car driver  we can compare notes about my racing perhaps hey dan there he is like you look like a race car you do  look like a race car driver how you doing man look at him he's all handshakes for everybody man 
[02:48:00]  what's up dan yeah he's got that congratulations indy car driver look there right yeah you kind of do  do you have to walk around with sponsorship shirts yeah i see that honda you got the izod  he's the big one bro which one william rast yeah william rast is uh racing team no that's justin  timberlake's clothing line yeah that's like the the primary sponsor right really when you've got  uh curb records big machine records yeah is there babes in this sport curb records i think look after 
[02:48:30]  taylor swift yeah i see okay that's that's a babe right there that's hot chicks you smell really good  by the way it's always awkward to tell another man that but he smells really good it's good call  i ain't gonna sleep with you bro no no no i'm sorry to break that you know what though  wearing a little brake fluid behind his ears instead of beating up jimmy i'm gonna second  that because now i smells good yeah it does what is that shit what is that probably a better way to  ask what is it clean clothes yeah it's a man that actually showered and changed as i sit here in 
[02:49:00]  sweatpants today yes why is your hair down you'll wash it okay do you know what it is jimmy can you  figure out no he doesn't want to say because some of these colognes they don't want to be  passed around to everybody it's every fool yeah i don't blame him i don't blame you keep it to  yourself oh it's in a silver bottle yeah there you go yeah it's just whatever it is good stuff  hey congrats wow that's uh that's a biggie you you enter a uh a long and prestigious list of people 
[02:49:30]  who have won the uh indy 500 and uh an exciting style nonetheless yeah it was definitely uh he  was obviously it's a big race to win the 100th anniversary of the indianapolis 500 yeah what i  gotta ask you you you're driving and also i'm you guys have seen it all but weren't you thinking what  the fuck i'm gonna win this thing because this guy crashes do you know what i didn't until until i  looked at the the replay i've been i watched the the replay a few times now yeah and and it's and it's 
[02:50:00]  different it's it's different when you're in the cockpit that's that's that's one of those things  is you can be a monday morning quarterback like the guy the guy that he was overtaking around the  outside was going incredibly slow right the closing rate for us i was probably approaching him doing  225 miles an hour so if he catches somebody that's 150 and he slows down to that speed i'll be on that kid  really quick right um so he was probably concerned about that i know he was being told because he was  having to save fuel i wasn't that i was coming and then he made that decision but it's uh that's 
[02:50:30]  always a big risk going around the outside it's very much a one one lane or one line as we say  racetrack but when you get up into that gray it just sucks you right yeah the rub the rubber is laid  down in the groove right and and that's pretty much where you guys stay you get up high what do you get  little marbles and the marbles and the dust and and just uh and uh yeah like i said what happens as  soon as the car gets up in there it just goes light and then it won't react to the from his in-car 
[02:51:00]  camera you could see the front end got really light and kind of slid over for it looked like for no  apparent reason yeah it's just there's no right there's no grip yeah no grip so uh oh yeah how did  you know he was running low on fuel do you guys know that about the other cars yeah because well just  with with strategy um he pulled up next to him and looked at his game he came alongside and held up  yeah i think no it's uh he he decided to pit he actually was running about eighth ninth or tenth the 
[02:51:30]  whole day so so at that point in the race teams will try different things to to get their car up  front well what they did is is they kind of pitted before us and then just tried to you know stretch  out you know the amount of laps he could do on on a tank of fuel um myself and another guy scott  dixon we we pitted um and you know it was a disadvantage from the standpoint of track position  but it meant that we could go flat out for the rest of the way push it harder yeah so uh we were  we were coming with a head of steam for sure oh okay oh yeah you are now you're you're saying you 
[02:52:00]  were coming with a head of steam now obviously that if this guy hadn't wrecked you were second  so what what were you thinking maybe five laps before this happened were you thinking that you had a  chance of catching this guy or or were you pretty much relegated to the fact that you might be  second here no so so my team had told me that he this was his 36 lap on 36 he'd done yeah 36 laps  on that tank of fuel so he was close to running out and uh it's one of those things where you just you 
[02:52:30]  you just got to go for it so you were going flat out just trying to catch this guy yeah because you  got to you got to put him under pressure he could run out at any any time so for me it was important  just to stay flat out and keep the pressure on and and in effect hope that he hoping he pushes  it too far runs out of gas before the start finish line and then i'd have been able to capitalize  now uh probably a dumb question but obviously in the end it was a mistake but uh he had no choice  he had to try to pass him on the on the outside like that or was there something else he could have 
[02:53:00]  done that he didn't do he could he could have bottled up behind that car but you were screaming up on  exactly and that and that's why that's why he chose not to do that so it's one of those things  so he pretty much had to do that maneuver yeah if you like i think he that you've got to have that  mentality that winning mentality and he didn't want to give up the indy 500 by breaking and sitting  behind another guy he wanted to go for it which you got to give him credit for here's a question of  you know you're never going to know what would have or could have happened but let's say he tucks up 
[02:53:30]  behind him around the curve yeah right after he's out of that curve now he comes out to pass him  he's already slowed down to stay behind him around the curve you come out of that curve flying do you  think you could have passed him on that straight if he had to slow down for that car before the the  finish line yeah at the right i was coming there would that would have been a good chance yeah that  you you might have nailed him if he had safely gone behind that guy until he hit the straight how come  you could have made the turn and he couldn't because he was passing somebody had to go farther out he was 
[02:54:00]  he was passing on the right yeah there was no one in the way for him he would have been in the  straight and he would come around and blow past him probably because he still would have been coming  up to speed he was younger thinking damn this uh this two and a half million checks oh man oh  that's what the winner gets yeah i think i think i got just under 2.6 two and a half million  i love you talking about it that's what does he come in guys making an hour right  did he make uh second place that guy yeah so he may i think for instead of 2.6 what does he get 
[02:54:30]  he would have got a stake dive yeah so that that crash cost him 1.6 yeah well  mill's still wow man he's a rookie right yeah yeah he's his first year wow damn so now you you  you pass this wreck uh did you did you see it how close did you get to it did you take your eye off  the prize there for a second to take a look did you rubberneck no and i and i tell you this is this 
[02:55:00]  is a true story i followed sam hornish we were in practice in 2006 and there was a crash in front of  the two of us sam hit the debris he was going dead straight he ran over a piece of carbon and it flipped  the car so so so in all seriousness when he crashed that the last thing i was thinking is damn i'm  going to win this race like the the biggest thing for me was to avoid the debris and you never know  what an indy car driver's thinking right you're leading the indy 500 you hit the wall you've got 
[02:55:30]  the second place guy coming like do you drive across the track and take him with you and hope  that you get i mean hope you come across the track i'm like so i i got to avoid the debris and it was  important for me to focus on making sure that i could react quick enough if he decided to come  back across the track and and once i cleared that then i'm like yes i've just won my second race  what do you say to yourself in the car was there a holy shit come on what was it what was it i need  to know honestly there was a lot of emotion it wasn't like a holy shit there was just a a ton of 
[02:56:00]  emotion there was there was a lot going on for me obviously this is this is my only one or it was my  only race that i'm contracted to do i'm actually unemployed right now so it's the biggest  that's the biggest unemployment check i received wait you don't have a sponsor right now no my  deal was just just for that one take that shirt off why are you giving them free advertising  i'm out of contracts well you gotta you gotta have something kind of in the pipe you've been  talking i bet right yeah well the the biggest thing for me at certainly at my stage in my career is to 
[02:56:30]  make sure i'm with a good team i mean right you know you you want to do this to win and um you know  with all due respect to a lot of the teams out there it's hard it's hard for them to compete with a  couple of the big guys you need the big bucks coming in and uh no it's not the big bucks it  doesn't matter about that now i've done well enough where i can i can be more selective i i don't mean  for you personally i mean for the team that you need you need money to pay for the machinery you can't be  you know uh rigging something together instead of getting you know quality parts and you have 
[02:57:00]  mechanics you got to pay the best it's you're right and it's the development the wind tunnel the  wind tunnel stuff the shaker rig and all these all these crazy things that perhaps people don't see  from the outside but it's it's so important when you're in the business yeah that's uh so so you're  you're looking and are people contacting you and yeah we've i would assume we we've we've had a couple  of offers for uh for the next race the next race is a it's a it's a twin race the texas uh 275 
[02:57:30]  um so they're gonna do it's the first time they've ever done this they're gonna do uh you know one race  it's a shorter race based on you know you'll qualify the quickest guy starts first um and like  i said it's gonna it's gonna be a shorter race but then for the second race that they're gonna do on  the same day you draw out the hat or out of a hat for your for your grid position and then and then  you start the second race like start it like that i'd love to be part of it but unfortunately i'm gonna  be in the booth i'm gonna do the the tv uh oh you are yeah okay what do you uh how do you get 
[02:58:00]  started in uh in racing that's always uh kind of a weird thing with some guys like in the old  days it was bootlegging right right you know uh had to get started people no believe it or not i  started in go-karts at four years of age and when i when i say i started at four years of age my father  was was a really good go-kartter and he drove for one of the big teams well the rival big team  you know took it took a bet on on me thinking that i'd be as good as my dad hopefully and uh i was i 
[02:58:30]  was at the racetrack every weekend obviously i wasn't allowed to race till i was eight but every time  i could practice i'd be on on the track practicing at four years of age and it was it was professional  it wasn't like it was you know your kid karts at the fair yeah yeah it was uh it was full-on but it's  um it's it's a really cool sport to be part of i i mean i love it i really do oh i don't doubt i  would tell you about my own racing experience uh it is in the uh nascar uh but um uh yeah i i went to  i went to yeah nascar nascar uh i went to a pocono uh raceway and uh i was hearing it took a few laps 
[02:59:00]  around there what speed did you get up uh you know for you it's uh probably nothing i uh i got to  about 170 at one point oh so you were doing what we do in second gear it's second gear  that's uh yeah that that does amaze me because uh this this is a this is my um run with my own  car this is with the shelby i had the uh he's got the mustang but this is nothing are you expecting 
[02:59:30]  him to be impressed by this no but it's fun do you realize him show you showing him that that's  the pace car coming out of the pit that's like somebody sitting you down going hey look at this  podcast i did in my living room exactly i know hey he's got to appreciate the fun and excitement of  uh being behind the wheel uh i think no it's it's it's cool like um no it is the the indy cars 
[03:00:00]  especially right now that they're so fast and i don't know if you guys watch the qualifying shows  but to think that michael andretti's two of his five cars were bumped out the field was i mean it's  oh it's it's so so competitive wow that is yeah it's good to be part of right now do you uh do  you look at with a certain respect on the old guys that that uh did this when perhaps it wasn't as  safe and uh they were still experimenting with a lot of things yeah you look at you look at some of 
[03:00:30]  the cars these guys used to drive and yeah i wouldn't even step in them goofy ideas of the higher  wing it's unbelievable hot water radiator pipes running right next to your legs and stuff like  we're we're blessed these days our cars are incredibly safe and we've got the you know the  the soft wall around the outside of the track now which they say is soft but when you hit that thing  at 225 it still hurts yeah i i believe it the uh yeah the safety technology has gotten amazing when  you could look at uh like you know what happened in front of you there uh and and he walks away from 
[03:01:00]  it uh jr yeah well the the biggest thing is it's supposed to look a lot more spectacular because  all that stuff flying off is dissipating the energy taking it away from the driver yeah the worst thing  is not seeing anything leaving the vehicle because then the driver is absorbing a lot of uh energy yeah  if you see our cars going backwards with the gearbox first that's when you when you tend to worry but um  yeah for the most part and knock on wood we we haven't had any uh injuries for for a while which is 
[03:01:30]  which is great that is amazing because years ago you would just see these spectacular flaming crashes  up into the up into the friggin stands on fire it's like like the hindenburg disaster and uh it is  amazing you have a bad crash yeah i've i mean i've been doing it a long time now so i've had a couple  um and it's always the ones that actually don't look that bad are the ones that hurt the most i was  doing uh richmond it's um you know it's a tiny track that we that we used to do um i was doing a 
[03:02:00]  qualifying sim round there and uh one of the mechanics had forgot to do the suspension bolt up  they put they mounted in a different position for for performance but he forgot to put the bolt on  and i came out i came out of turn two and yeah i mean it's it's a 15 16 second lap and i was probably  doing about 170 and the car just turned hard right into the wall that was a big one but indianapolis  in my rookie year i uh defended kind of vigorously i i had some guy was was getting a run on me 
[03:02:30]  so i defended pretty pretty vigorously actually too vigorously to tell you the truth and uh i paid  for it i hit the wall and then the wind got underneath the car and flipped it over oh it did  one of those yeah yeah those are what kind of injuries you get from that no actually i i didn't  have i didn't have it no nothing at all not even bumps it's amazing that you walk away from  something like that it was one of those things i was just yeah you know indianapolis is it's a  month long and and the you know it's it's a month long at the racetrack but what people don't see is 
[03:03:00]  the preparation that these guys put in back at back at the race shop itself you know they're they're  away from their families for a long time yeah and and and the seams on the car just when you rub your  hand over the bodywork if you can feel that they'll spend days trying to rub that out so you just you  can't feel it over the course of the whole race that would take some time off of your  and um you know i was i was just bummed for for letting them down on that one but that's that's  the way it's this is a very very special race for us oh yeah that would have to be sure uh that's  amazing i have to ask uh danica patrick you guys don't think she's hot do you 
[03:03:30]  she's a buddy of mine she's a buddy even though she's been tugging on my arm every now and then  actually you can pull that one up on youtube oh yeah that's a good one but uh  she's she's all right they make her sound like she's this she's bombshell i think she's very  attractive when she's dressed up for a shoe she looks good yeah yeah all right i'm sorry i'm sorry  i didn't know you guys were friends no i mean she's an indie car racer i'll tell it like it is she's 
[03:04:00]  she's cute she's all right yeah and you know based on the curve of the drivers she's like really  really hot yeah because you know i think of who else is racing how was debbie gibson what's that  she want to come in and say hi real fast i didn't ask her you know debbie gibson i just said hi no  i don't know debbie gibson she's an old pop singer from years ago she was like the first britney  spears really many many moons ago where you originally uh from uh originally from england  england yes i tell everybody alabama but yeah i don't think i don't think they buy it 
[03:04:30]  how long are you racing so i've been in indycar since 2000 so i've been doing i i started in go-karts  at four um moved moved into the race cars about 18 um and just been doing it ever since do you  ever see grease lightning yeah with wendell scott right what was the name wendell scott uh yeah  race car driver and then talladega knights oh yeah okay that one or will ferrell i didn't see that  it was pretty funny i guess that's like their spinal tap all right the race car drivers that's a good 
[03:05:00]  one it's uh not very accurate but it's a good one yeah do you i i remember watching in the uh in the  old days too where uh you never realized how how the pit area was so dangerous uh until you just  saw people with that with that fire that you can't see yeah and some of the pit crew would just be  going ah just freaking out and now the pit crew is dressed in all the safety but they used to just  be in jeans and fucking t-shirt and yeah it's fuel them up let them go it's it's crazy it's the best 
[03:05:30]  way i could i don't know your big freeway here but like in la the 405 it's it's it's like you being in  the slow lane and and changing a tire uh on the 405 freeway in rush hour it's it's nuts i mean yeah  the big the biggest thing now it's so competitive that to make positions up in the pits is you know  what everybody's trying to do right it's hard to pass on the track and uh you know you're trying to  save tenths of a second we're trying to drive into our pit box very quick and break at the last 
[03:06:00]  possible minute well you know sometimes you end up hitting you guys yeah you've got to get out really  quick it's a tight pit lane it looks like on tv it looks very wide but when you're trying to get  you know multiple cars out it's uh it's it's really tight we get we get a lot of incidents  there actually do you guys all have i'm sorry do you guys all have your own pit area yeah stupid  question no no it's a good question it's an assigned pit area indianapolis is based off your  qualifying speed so so the person that qualifies on the pole has the first pick so typically you want  to be as the furthest down yeah i would want to be yeah that's a huge advantage obviously yeah 
[03:06:30]  absolutely yeah when you pull into the pit you're yeah what do you they change your tires whatever  they do how long does it usually take like an app like a problem free pit four tires and fuel  four tires and fuel is eight seconds just it should it should be less than that a little bit less  it's hilarious are you fucking eight seconds yeah what and it feels like an age if it feels like  come on come on yeah what how long was it uh say 20 years ago holy smokes uh they just have to pull 
[03:07:00]  the jacks out and stuff yeah man it's got they got down to a science now obviously it's it's got to  have been 45 seconds right really yeah oh look at this look at that we're watching a pit change  there you go where's the gas right here yeah on on the on the left side of the car how do you get  the gas in the car that fast it's uh yeah it just comes from a big tank that that flow it flows 
[03:07:30]  extremely quickly wait now that was only one bolt on each one yeah only only only one only one wheel  nut one right on the middle it's good they don't have like my old saturn did you have like the wheel  lock and all that shit yeah he's in the glove compartment trying to find it and another uh great thing  about this and i don't know when they uh when they came up with this but what a great idea just  having that pneumatic jack system yeah that's in the car they plug in a hose uh and jacks actually  come out of the bottom of the car lift the car up man you know what you're talking about it's 
[03:08:00]  fantastic it's amazing so that because it used to be the guy coming out with the fucking jack yeah it's  like how long it takes to get the fucking car up now it's boom it's up it's back down and the guy's  what if you hit that when you're driving or does it have to be a certain speed you can only the  pick guy has to put it in how long uh do these guys practice that just hours at a time uh you know  the the top teams will practice every single day i mean look how dangerous that is oh damn yeah he  just got we just watched some guy get hit by a car that's coming through is he dead 
[03:08:30]  it's uh you know it's it's just um but everything happens so so quick but what they do now as well  this this is this is the the hard one for me is they won't allow because what people were doing  they were they were leaving as quick as they possibly can as soon as a guy waved right but  sometimes you know that that the fuel probe that they connect to the car to you know put fuel in the  car that's really heavy and if it doesn't come out at the right angle it won't come out right away  oh so what happens was the guy that sends you out the pits would would pull it out but it wouldn't 
[03:09:00]  come all the way and the guy like would see that motion and go go send it and then you're dragging  a freaking pit tank down the road i've seen that happen a couple times danny just uh picked up on  something in this video where he punches the guy in the helmet for running him over i guess after the  fact he leaps over and punches the guy in the helmet watching the guy get run over in the pit a little  bit and then he gets pissed off and gives him a right gonna do anything should have head butted  him oh man seen that before but yeah i mean there's there's the mechanics don't like when when 
[03:09:30]  people make silly mistakes on pit road and you shouldn't as a professional no it's way too  dangerous for those guys how many uh how long are you actually uh riding it by the way this is what  an asshole as i'm talking to him i'm making an oval circle with my fingers just so you know i'm talking  clearly how long the time are you actually going for so so like the race the race length is about  indianapolis 500 is about three and a half hours and then uh a typical stint where you know you can 
[03:10:00]  run out of full tank of gas uh well jr did 36 laps so i could only do about 32 laps how long for a lap  so it's 30 39.5 seconds between 39.5 and 40 seconds depending on traffic so 40 times say 36 is uh wow  okay that's about 28 minutes something like that can i ask the p question i was actually gonna ask  do you ever have to shit while you were riding i figure you get the duties out of the way before 
[03:10:30]  the race but but the p i mean you're drinking a lot of fluid because you're dehydrating yeah  come on hey if you gotta go you gotta go right have you repeat your pants while you're running  after yeah everybody does actually robbie gordon the nascar driver yeah a funny story um dario got  injured at indianapolis and uh so they put robbie in to replace him and uh you know dario didn't want  you know the guy taking his spot to pee in his car that was like dario's car and robbie gordon put on  this like he i was a rookie in the team there so he he was the guy that was i think he thought it 
[03:11:00]  was his job to teach me all the bad things because he's that kind of guy he's a great guy funny guy  and uh so he puts his catheter thing on and a tube that runs down his leg and it comes out like  the the bottom like of his of his race suit and uh they're sitting on the grid um prior to the race  and i guess one of the mechanics like runs over to the car because he can see leaking fluid  and uh so he gets on the radio and speaks to robbie and robbie just like smiles at dario but dario was 
[03:11:30]  a little upset with that one but yeah if you if you gotta go man you gotta go  piss in the car you guys gotta go three and a half hours yeah fluids in all seriousness is it's  very important to stay hydrated like when we run as close as we do obviously you know you you lose  clarity uh with your vision so it's so important to stay you know hydrated and and you the diet has  to be right what what time would you pick to do that because i don't think during a this is  technical it's kind of technical now well it is kind of interesting that that you kind of are a 
[03:12:00]  little distracted when you're just kind of ah you know ah letting off that that fluid there and uh  if you were making a move at that point i would think you'd probably want to be under yellow or  something anytime that i've been yeah it's it's been under yellow you don't think about it no pun  intended yeah when you're yellow when you're going when you when you're running you uh you wouldn't  even it's a great question because when you're in the ocean you got a leak you can't relax yourself  because another wave's coming you know what i mean so it's something to do yes you can't just 
[03:12:30]  relax remind me never go swimming with you guys yeah yeah stay out of the pool fuck that  so now by the way do you have a straw or something you're not actually picking something and drinking  it are you do you have a straw because you got to hold the wheel both hands no we have uh it's  we're actually kind of like we have um basically it's uh like a camel pack thing um that the cyclists  use a great big one of them and uh there's a tube that that that comes up into your helmet but  it's got a motor on it so you push a button and it kind of shoots that oh okay water into your 
[03:13:00]  mouth you guys have thought of everything it's got to be that's got to be pretty warm water after a  while no the mechanics are good they they freeze it they freeze it the night before so uh yeah you're  all good to go i mean yeah if you don't do that it'll literally burn your mouth and it's got yeah  it's got to be hot in the cockpit there uh during the race what what what do they use to cool you  down is it uh no airflow or yeah the airflow typically takes care of you but i mean we've  we we do it so much you just get used to it it really doesn't bother you that the most it bothers 
[03:13:30]  you is when you do a practice day because you pretty much don't get out of the car very much  you're in it the whole time and it's when you come in the pits that you notice the heat as soon as you're  on track you're fine but when you when you come in i mean some days we're testing and it might be  you know 90 degrees well that means in the cockpit it's it's well over 100 so yeah and the track is  just burning i'm sure exactly so it's it's it's it's not bad though i mean like i say we've been doing it  long enough and it's it's not like you're worried about sweating really so practice how can you  really practice on a practice day though because there's no other cars with you right yeah but you 
[03:14:00]  work on the setup of the race car you'll do long runs see how the car performs over the duration of  the run um you know a lot a lot of different things like that you'll see a lot of aerodynamic  tests that we do um you know they'll they'll change they'll change the shape of you know a  certain wing part and it can make a huge difference believe it or not when you think we  you know you win races by hundreds of a second um that these little things that can make a huge 
[03:14:30]  difference i've seen uh some of the adjustments on the front wing of some of the nascars and there's  so many adjustment rods on there just to tweak it or twist the wing a little bit uh it's amazing to  me that it's gotten to that point where you're talking about hundreds of seconds adding up yeah  absolutely each lap absolutely well i mean on the on the steering wheel i can i can move uh weight to  to um the the inside front wheel and that'll in effect make the car more loose loose as you guys say 
[03:15:00]  loose i say uh i say oversteer and understeer but that'll make the car that'll make the car  more loose or you know obviously if the car is loose i can i can shift weight to the other side and  it'll give the car more push more understeer um so and then we've got uh front and rear anti-roll  bar adjusters um there's there's there's you can even have a damper adjuster in the car shock 
[03:15:30]  in the car so now as you're going something that would have taken you know going into the pit  and having some guy turn a wrench you can feel it as you're driving and adjust accordingly like  that exactly and each click we have a range of 20 clicks and it'll shift 10 pound a click and it  makes a huge difference to us i that's amazing yeah god when you're i have a question when you're  thought of that don't you when you're going i'm always like worried when i'm passing in traffic  how do you how do you not you're doing 200 fucking miles and how are you not worried that your tires  are just going to bump in i how do you make any sense out of that decisions too in the lack of 
[03:16:00]  space you have to work with yeah yeah you know you you just get used to it and um you know typically  it's been the same group of drivers now for a while obviously you get rookies come in and and you get  new people but you you get to learn their traits like you can learn elio castroneves you can drive  very close um with with him because he'll respect the fact that you're close but he's he's not  unpredictable um yeah you're around something like canaan he can get a little unpredictable 
[03:16:30]  sometimes how close is close for you guys i mean literally an inch yeah you're you'll see i mean  you can see on uh you guys are an inch apart when you're going that fast yeah open wheels and you  know what we can be like at texas this this next race coming up you're that that that's a high bank  track um so we'll run inches apart side by side but you might also have a car at like an inch or two  in front of you and you'll be sitting right up behind that car you could even have cars you know 
[03:17:00]  like inches behind you so you're in you're in close proximity to you know it could be four to six cars  it's uh it's it's nuts and maintaining speed yeah a lot of tailgating happening yeah and uh that's  that's why you just got to trust the people you're around but but i think you know like i say a lot of  us have been around enough to to respect one another and know that you know bad things can happen  how do you all right so say you're sandwiched between three other cars how do you pass anybody  no one's gonna move how do you fucking get around anybody i don't get it it's horrifying 
[03:17:30]  well we have to rely a lot on aerodynamics so um you know if sometimes people's cars don't  they're not able to run that close and they'll wash up the track they'll push up the track  so uh yeah that's when that's when you make your move wow you could see when you're watching uh  when you're watching at home it's a lot easier to see like oh shit that guy's slowing down or  something's fucking up with his car or guys like to cuss on air right yeah a lot yeah just accentuate 
[03:18:00]  what you're saying right it's just the way we talk it's so weird yeah i don't know does it sound  weird i wonder why sounds yeah no it's just talking about fucking cars you know we try not to do it  gratuitously like we're discussing cunting tires  you want to sound more manly and we throw a couple fucks i know you're a race car driver  we gotta toughen up here we're fucking fruity radio people you ever uh time for another hack  question you ever uh get speeding tickets yeah driving uh as a civilian no we used to we talked 
[03:18:30]  to the shield we talked to the motocross guys a while ago and they said they don't own motorcycles  because they're not crazy they would never put bring a motorcycle on a highway right but they  would do all the what they do in motocross you know yeah it's pretty much the same with us i  know um yeah when i go on the road i'm pretty chilled you know yeah it's one of those things  when you when you're in the race car you're getting every last tenth or hundredth of a second  out of the thing it's nice when you when you're driving home just to like kind of relax relax i mean  i've got the coffee like in one hand i got the cell phone in the other that's my and steering 
[03:19:00]  where you need that's that's my biggest problem doesn't that make you crazy when you're in like  the lincoln tunnel or something and you're like that's a hundred and a tenth of a second you're wasting  because i'm horrible like i literally will look at the guy in front of me and there's five car  lengths in front of him i'm like you yeah that's why i'm in traffic because i don't know how you guys  i guess maybe because every real bit of driving is kind of pussiest compared to what it just turns  his brain off probably but when you're when you're driving though do you just as a civilian do you  still look five six cars ahead and go yeah i could cut around to make a couple yeah i'm going in here 
[03:19:30]  i like to glide through the traffic i hate the people that sit in the freaking slide right fast  lane going yes yes i hate them that's an american thing i've traveled a lot that's an american thing  man americans are stupid get out of the left lane move you you're over in germany they're not pulling  that well the autobahn has no speed limit right yeah in some spots you really don't see this anywhere  else except for america no no well are we such assholes you do but like it's a it's a big that's an 
[03:20:00]  american thing it really is left lane 40 miles an hour with nary a clue that there's a parade  behind them exactly if you look in your mirror and see a bunch of cars behind you and you look in  front and see nobody don't you realize you're the problem yeah well it's like my bumper sticker  says sober slow on booze enjoy the road so anywhere else man if someone's behind you they just move  out of your way if you're in the fast lane yeah i mean you can write that be yeah there's some 
[03:20:30]  crazy people i mean in in england yeah you know if you're in the fast lane you're you're hauling  bar you better you better move so if you're if you're going slow they're gonna they're gonna come  right at you they'll let you know and they're they're actually aggressive they'll they'll pull  you over and beat you oh nice driving hooligans i love it what's the uh what's the big race in  england like is it as popular there is it his here uh yeah motor racing is is popular obviously  the indianapolis 500 is the biggest race in the world there's uh there's definitely no race like 
[03:21:00]  that um but the the the big races in england are obviously the british grand prix the one with the  most history is is monaco um that's obviously not in england but it's uh that's that's kind of  europe's europe's right kind of blue ribbon you've raced in all these places right i have i haven't i  haven't raced in formula one i actually declined formula one to stay in indy cars so i'll never be  allowed back there oh wow it's just a bit of an ego thing but i love the indianapolis 500 and um 
[03:21:30]  you know it's it's it's such a cool event to be part of like the qualifying the practice and the  way the car feels driving around that track there so now you haven't done road courses yeah you race  yeah indy car indy car has road courses now but obviously when i was when i was um in europe it was  it was all road courses i only did ovals when i came over here road course where they just rope off  regular road no it's a different you now you're turning right and left right and left yeah you're  right though they they do uh we do a very big street race um in actually my my home city st petersburg 
[03:22:00]  florida long beach is a big one yeah long beach grand prix is more um actually you had a track not  too far down the road from here watkins glen oh yeah that now that is is a phenomenal road course to  drive really really good everyone talks about watkins glen yeah that's a great track do you prefer  road or ovals i like them both they require a different different technique but i really like  them both mixes it up hey is there a button on the steering wheel to pass people dave and pa's uh  saying you gotta ask them about it it has a push to push the pass button so uh we it's um you know 
[03:22:30]  honda uh is is the engine that we all use and they've developed a system where it's it's almost like  a shoot of extra horsepower for a certain period of time and they can adjust that that length of time  um at indianapolis i believe it lasted you got uh 15 15 push to passes and each one lasted i think uh  20 seconds so it gives you it gives you just a little bit of extra horsepower and what it helps  you do is complete an overtaking maneuver basically um so you're going around someone you know you're 
[03:23:00]  going around them you just want to get around them faster you hit that but why obviously you're  sacrificing fuel during that time you're going to use that you're going to use a little bit more  fuel the other guy pushes his button too yeah yeah that's that's a good point thank you  that's why he's got some knowledge and i'm doing the common guy shit that's great i love this work  looks like the old cruise control on my steering wheel that's right jim jim jim uses his car for 
[03:23:30]  different things that's right uh really you have a passenger seat in yours no it'll be no good for me  because where would a young lady sit when she hops in for money or you know jim likes to take a lot  of right turns himself yes it's a whole prostitution ritual thing so um you press that and it gives you  extra horsepower how many horsepower are you riding um when you're when you're uh going down the road  regular no no no in the in this car how many horsepower uh in in the indy car you'll you'll probably 
[03:24:00]  have close to 700 and uh 1500 50 it's about 1588 pounds the car wow 1500 power to weight ratio is  very good what are you driving your personal life i like i've been part of the honda family so i i have  and i've got two kids now so i've got the acura mdx i've got um the honda cord yeah hatchback yeah it was  one of my first cars nice that thing fucking flew nice it really did yeah what do you know i got the  acura rl i mean when i was single i had like the lamborghinis and stuff like that but there's 
[03:24:30]  really no need for them anymore no yeah exactly they are just good to pick up i'd be scared i i could  never drive something like that up to a place because my self-hatred and shame like as i got  out everybody would know i just felt like i didn't deserve such a nice car so i could never drive a  fancy car that's debbie oh she's very lovely i can see why you like debbie isn't debbie great  yeah she's like a legendary singer yeah she's been a pop star here for like since the 80s  yeah look at the friggin time what are we doing yeah we gotta run i know her body looks great she 
[03:25:00]  looks fantastic wow so wait are you married no i'm single well let's see what game you got  he's got game jimmy down here's my here's my game go ahead show him all right look i'll give you this  for oral this for full service that's my game look i'll be really nice to you if you do this  at the end of the massage i have no rap i have forgotten how to have a rap with a chick i really  if there's no money involved i'm a lost soul really i'm totally lost try using your honesty 
[03:25:30]  that doesn't work a lot it seems to now it's it's it's well worth it sweetheart valtrex  update on move the mic so you get a picture for twitter for you no worries do you make fun of  the people that have to drive the viagra car well that's the viagra don't sponsor anybody in indy  cars they don't do that in indy yeah they do us they're doing that nascar i think that was mark  martin right for a while was it yeah i think so i bet you're here when the viagra car is right behind  you that's good stuff on the brakes do you guys have rear view mirrors and directionals 
[03:26:00]  we do we have mirrors either side of the cockpit okay and then actually we have uh uh spotters  and so they're they're up on um in effect like a spotting tower where they can basically see the  whole track uh we have two of them at indianapolis and we have obviously radios in our ears and we'll  be able to they'll let us know um you know where where another car is in relation to us and they'll 
[03:26:30]  let us know things like um if if if you're not leading and the guy leading is is doing uh  different racing line or using a different racing line to what you are they'll say hey we'll try  moving up the track and this is working for the leader stuff like that so they're kind of  take what the leader's doing and kind of pass some info on to you yeah they're a good source of  information for us the announcers to me like uh horse racing uh guys who play by whatever they  call her announcers are amazing because there's so much action and to remember all the names and i  imagine for indy it's like a three and a half hour race where you have to you have to talk 
[03:27:00]  and here comes number six number five is still slowing down number six is ahead of him again  and now here comes number four it's like you gotta talk for three and a half hours like that  it's fucking amazing knowing all the cars pretty you know because i uh i did one race where i was  um in the commentary booth too it goes much quicker when you're sitting all right yeah yeah yeah and  it's much harder than you think they've got an earpiece in you and they're telling you like when to  wrap up and it's it's uh i give those guys credit it's definitely harder than it looks i mean uh 
[03:27:30]  is that what you're also looking to do though so doing the commentary i think i'd like to keep  driving for another five six years but maybe after that it's i definitely i definitely enjoy it  yeah yeah if you're not going to be in the race car itself it's uh it's it's better than being at  home i think watch some of the new young bucks out there yeah tearing up the track do you have to  be a certain weight you know with with jockeys they weigh them on the horse and it's like i guess  you're an in-shape guy so you don't want to be like 20 pounds overweight right that just slows you  down yeah well yeah it definitely slows you down and then so for us what they do is they weigh you at the 
[03:28:00]  start of the season you have to pass an indy car medical and they'll weigh you then and then what  they do like danic is obviously the lightest and so they give her you know a certain amount of  ballast that she has to carry and then with the other drivers they'll kind of look at the you know  the range and then depending on where you fit within that range they'll they'll give you a  certain amount of ballast they handicap you with extra weight where does that weight go put in the car  it's almost on the floor of the car uh they have like kind of areas for ballast because don't you  guys have to figure that out now too what's that when you figure out how much weight probably 
[03:28:30]  center gravity you probably yeah yeah that's that's uh that's a huge performance that makes  it adjust all sorts of stuff too right yeah so being light is is is important because you can  kind of move the weight around to suit the characteristics of the car i'd put it all in  the front wing yeah that would be a good spot for it going around those cars talk about push it is up  to you guys where you want to put it yeah you can play you can place it um put it just right on  your crotch or something no probably not probably not balance is like what 10 15 pounds something 
[03:29:00]  like that uh depending that's what you're saying i i carry i carry uh 15 for the indianapolis 500  wow so does anybody carry none like the heaviest one yeah yeah there's there's there's some people  that carry on actually uh townsend bell my teammate he i don't know how this worked he was five or six  pounds heavier than me but yeah he didn't have to carry any but you had to carry 15 yeah yeah so maybe  their meth is not as good as it all the cars weigh the same or no uh it depends there's uh we've been 
[03:29:30]  using the same car for for about seven years now i believe and so some of the older cars have been  crashed the tubs have then been repaired or typically if the tubs have been repaired from crashes that it  keeps adding weight so uh again that's a disadvantage to have an older tub the car that i actually won  500 in this year uh was the seventh car made in 2003 so it was a it was a really old car wow that is  an old one yeah but you probably like that you know everything about how it handles and you probably  you know all the parts are always kind of new right so yeah they they they have to um if if they 
[03:30:00]  don't put new parts on they'll crack check them to make sure they mileage them and then crack check  them to make sure that that they're going to be fine how long are tires good for one set of tires  can go how far fast don't do a good job actually they do they do a phenomenal job um you know  uh indianapolis we'll so we'll we'll do laps uh around an average speed of 225 miles an hour and  they'll be good for you know 30 30 to 35 laps which every pit you change them yes yeah you you can 
[03:30:30]  actually you can actually go longer it just you like if if you put new tires or if i didn't put new  tires on and the rest of the field did then then i'd be swallowed up in a heartbeat where do all those  tires go back to firestone oh and they what just make uh melt down the rubber probably yeah they go  into the rain forest and just light them on fire get rid of them forest got nothing going on  wait now what about rain see i hate driving in the rain i'm always afraid of hydroplaning  um when it rains do you panic or no yes but i mean you know what i'm saying like you're in a circle 
[03:31:00]  you're gonna make sharp turns in the rain oh my god you ever tried doing that well they shut down  races if it's raining on on the ovals yes on the on the road and street courses no we'll we'll carry  on in the rain they just put wet tires on so what's a wet what's the difference in a wet  tire on a regular it has like the grooves oh okay for the water to to go but you can take a  turn just as well in a wet tire and not not as quick no not not as quick you'll slip and slide  around more but it's actually it's fun to drive in the rain you can you can kind of throw the car 
[03:31:30]  around a little bit more you have to use throttle control you don't have to worry about being so  smooth so if you drive and you feel it like wavering a little bit you don't freak out  no you gotta be really gotta be relaxed and cool in there i would hate that  slam on the brakes jimmy would be the worst yeah i really would i'd be doing i'd be doing like 80  like zipping away and 55 on the turns direction i like your questions i mean you got some good  questions i'm kidding this is what everybody gets curious about yeah the weird shit what scares the  shit out of me in in a in a car i can't comprehend like i would like to sit in the passenger seat and 
[03:32:00]  just go around once when there's no one on the track like have like just do like a nascar you  could you can do they do two-seater rides now do they uh yeah mario and jordi does does them  sometimes and that guy's like i mean he's a legend he's so committed in the two-seater program he goes  as quick as some people in in the regular car oh man he uh no the the big thing with us is you've  you've got to uh you got to be able to feel what the car's doing like indianapolis is all about  the confidence the driver's got to have a ton of confidence and so you know if if you do feel it 
[03:32:30]  getting loose you know don't you you just you know take a deep breath and then kind of look at  the the controls in the cockpit and try and adjust them to you know compensate for that do you have a  horn no i'd say what i did do i tell i i had i this is nothing to be proud of but i get i gave  somebody the bird uh at the 500 with like 15 laps to go i i like i talk about the aerodynamics i got up 
[03:33:00]  i got a run on a car and i picked up a push behind that car so coming out of turn two what's that  mean you picked up a push behind the car the car kind of washed up towards the wall and so i lost  some momentum well i mean i lost some momentum and there was a guy behind me that had a run on me  well he just drew alongside and just started driving me towards the wall yeah and i know yeah you know  i've been around long enough to know there was nothing i was i could do he was going to pass me  but he continued to like pin me to the wall so you know went once uh he he got by me i then i uh 
[03:33:30]  kind of let him go a bit then i got the run and and got him back and yeah i did have to give him  the bird to let him know that i was not best pleased because there was no need for that that's  awesome there was no need for that yeah it would be great if you threw something at him to like  through your coffee why does he have a cup of coffee he's gonna fucking drive it three and a half  hours yeah he's gotta stay awake indy 500 he's got a coffee in his hand what's wrong with you of course  exactly let's just fucking try to program his ipod right there's a coffee cup that he's got right to  his right you can't hear any music while you're doing that either right no music at all no no 
[03:34:00]  they play a little music why not they got people talking the whole time he's gotta hear his team  and it's with all sorts of figures that's great and uh this is obviously there's windshield wipers  on the rain which they they must coat the windshield with something too we don't have  windshield no no no no so it's all open oh i didn't realize that it's on his helmet you know  then how do you protect from the mosquitoes so wait so in the rain you're just getting wet  yeah well yeah oh that's fucking the aerodynamics of the car too kind of blows the shit away from you 
[03:34:30]  it blows it it blows it okay so oh that's gotta be a very powerful fucking force 200 over 200 miles an  hour uh is a little different than you know like 50 miles an hour on the highway with rain  so there's no there's no there's something on your helmet that that takes the rain off  no so so obviously i mean you've seen a a regular helmet we've got the visor and and basically the  way it's the way it's shaped kind of the water just pushes it right off and i mean they put like  that clear that what's that rain next or whatever on it yeah that stuff supposedly works do you guys 
[03:35:00]  still have that plastic that that tear offs the tear offs yeah yeah absolutely because i've seen the  ones do you ever see the ones with the motors on the side and they go and they just kind of  move out of the way that's what they do in motocross motocross yeah we don't do that we do uh we do  the you know they're just the the regular terrace so you pile up a few of these clear plastic things  and if someone's engine blows or they throw some oil at you and it sticks there they could just rip  off one and it's clear again jockeys do that too they have x amount of i forget how many goggles each 
[03:35:30]  one has but i guess they have to rip them off because of the dirt that's getting kicked up in their  face it'd be funny if it lands on a horse behind them and the horse's goggles on yeah i know  but don't think that's that's kind of sucked over your fucking if someone throws their goggles  and your horse trips humiliating fucking horse trips on goggles humiliating yeah that's the word for it  uh well dan weldon dan this was this really was great i know i think it turned me into a little  bit more of a fan you should be i'm not a big you guys should come out it's indy 500 yeah i'm not a  big uh fan of this sport but after this interview i think i'm gonna take a little more of a look 
[03:36:00]  when's the next time you race well there are i don't know yet i haven't uh finalized my deal  but then well the next race is uh happened to texas motor speedway this weekend on uh on saturday  night um and then there's two races right i gotta say two texas 275 um you'll be uh you'll be  impressed it's uh it's going to be intense and um you're like the sparks that the cars kick off  at night time it'll be uh i'm gonna check it out i think it's gonna be on versus yeah so it'll be 
[03:36:30]  the texas twin 275s on versus yeah it's a hell of a watch by the way what is that thanks man can you  really tell the time on that because i like numbers on my watch i i hate when it's just hands i can  never fucking i swear to god i can't it's like a child but honestly i love wonderment i like a watch  with a big six and a five on it yeah and all the other numbers yeah you know so yeah i cannot i cannot  look at a watch it's a very fancy watch a gentleman's watch there's very good eyesight  thanks gather yeah that's great you ever you ever hear the uh texas mile what they do out there and 
[03:37:00]  they just they have a mile of uh it looks like an old runway or something and you're just able to  bring your car there you make it go and people have taken their cars and just wrecked them at  over 200 miles an hour there's a lot of youtube videos on it it's uh probably not the safest thing  to do yeah well i think they do that at the racetrack too right at texas motor speedway i saw  something on tv once that they were doing a similar thing really just out there yeah there's  some passionate people with with with their cars crazy ass people yeah yeah well all right uh dan 
[03:37:30]  and it's dan weldon on twitter w h e l d o n is how you spell yeah dan was uh great man thanks guys  i appreciate it hopefully uh you will be uh tuning in more i absolutely would love to watch you uh have  you met not yet but he's one of the sponsors all right yeah yeah william rast is is one of the  sponsors on the car i think he'd be right up there you'll have to meet him now he just won  the big indy even after you won the race he's still doing yeah nice he sent me a message  he's probably busy busy to not call the guy who won the indy 500 he sent him a message 
[03:38:00]  yeah he sent me a message for a buddy or through colin dine that works for i was wondering do you  drink the milk after the race uh if you're lactose intolerant you can choose what milk you drink  you can yeah you can you can do uh chocolate milk skim milk but you can do whatever milk you want  it's not tradition the winner gets a big thing of milk yeah no one drinks soy milk though right  that's uh well you could it's on there yeah i think it's it's on the list of things to choose from
