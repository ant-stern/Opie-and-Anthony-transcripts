<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about Tax Day, focusing on their own tax burdens and a rival radio station's poorly conceived "Axes and Taxes Day" themed playlist.  They ridiculed the playlist's inconsistencies and jokingly suggested alternative themes like "Faxes and Taxes" and "Saxes and Taxes."  This segued into a discussion about the lack of recognition given to a deceased former colleague at their previous station, followed by commentary on a Howard Stern lawsuit against Sirius XM. The hosts then reviewed a list of absurd Tax Day radio promotion ideas ("Prep Burger" list) including a 1040-painted refrigerator demolition and an IRS agent dunking booth.  Celebrity tax debts, specifically those of Lionel Richie and Pamela Anderson, were also mentioned. The discussion took a bizarre turn with a detailed and vulgar conversation about barnacle penis size, fueled by a callerâ€™s contribution.  The segment concluded with a discussion about a space shuttle being transported atop a 747, and an announcement of upcoming guests: Vic Henley and Vinny from the Jersey Shore.  Throughout this section, the hosts frequently used vulgar and offensive language.

The show continued with a series of crude jokes targeting a woman's appearance and sexual preferences, transitioning to similarly derogatory comments about a CNN commentator's looks.  This offensive commentary extended to a discussion about a female judge's attractiveness.  The main focus then shifted to a clip of Bob Beckel's on-air meltdown on Hannity. Opie and Anthony played the audio, reacting with amusement and speculation about the reasons for Beckel's profanity-laced outburst.  They then played a listener-submitted rap song containing extremely offensive and racially charged lyrics.  Their reaction to the song involved shock and amusement, and they themselves used racial slurs in their commentary.  Further discussion included their opinions on Barack Obama, Mitt Romney's attempts at humor, and their criticisms of other radio personalities' work ethics.  The show reiterated the upcoming guests: Bob Beckel, comedian Vic Henley (potentially confused with Don Henley), and Vinny from the Jersey Shore,  with a significant portion dedicated to mocking and analyzing Beckel's on-air meltdown.  The entire segment was rife with vulgar and offensive language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Reg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment  and having very few minutes.  Oh, my God. 
[00:00:30]  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny, and it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  Yeah, crazy the better, yeah, yeah.  What, are you 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show's on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go, fuck.  I have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime. 
[00:01:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  Hey, everybody.  See, here we go again.  He did.  I was trying not to do any noises.  I was.  I was going right for the, hey, good morning, everyone.  Arr, arr, arr.  Not the, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.  You got to make it sound like you're saying something, but you're actually testing.  So it's like, how we doing this morning? 
[00:01:30]  Do a rollercoaster with your voice.  Make sure all the tones are there.  Fucking tax day.  Oh, it is.  Damn it.  We had a couple of days reprieve, because it was Sunday.  Oh, really?  And they don't do that on Sunday, which was the 15th.  And then yesterday, apparently, was some type of Washington holiday.  Some holiday.  Yeah, it was something. 
[00:02:00]  Holiday.  I'm not sure what it was.  Well, those guys, like Howard Stern, like to take a lot of days off down there in Washington.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oops.  Did I mention Howard Stern in there?  Whoops.  Oops.  But today, you have to have your taxes in and postmarked by midnight, people.  Really?  Or you will pay penalties, unless you have filed for an extension.  I haven't signed shit yet.  No, we are filed for an extension.  We are.  Yeah.  Our accountant has to look into something with our retirement plan. 
[00:02:30]  This is where me and Ann are a married couple.  Yeah.  How do you know that I haven't paid my taxes yet?  I know.  I know you haven't.  You shouldn't know that.  I know you filed for an extension.  You're waiting for information from our defined benefit plan to come through to our accountant,  and then we will file.  You can use my kid as a dependent, though.  I'm sorry.  I have been.  I'm sorry.  You can't do that.  You can't do that.  Damn it.  What was I going to say? 
[00:03:00]  Tax day.  Oh, someone fucking tweeted me yesterday.  I can't respond to everyone.  I do want to say that, but I read just about every tweet.  I try, right?  Our old station for tax day.  I got to know if this is true.  Oh, wait.  And I was lazy yesterday.  Which station?  Did you get the tweet?  AAF.  Oh, AAF?  Supposedly, they're doing, it's called, because you know we like this, you know, this  October shit, even though it's not October, they're doing something, yeah, it's right  there. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  What is that?  No.  Axes Taxes Day.  It's Axes and Taxes?  Axes.  Is there an and there?  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Axes and Taxes Day.  In honor of Taxes Day, they're going to play a lot of tunes where the Axe Man is front  and center.  Like guitar rock, because axes are guitars.  Like, yeah, my axe.  And Taxes, boy, they must have brainstormed for that one.  What can we do for Taxes? 
[00:04:00]  Axes and Taxes Day.  Dude, I got it.  What, what, what?  How about Axes and Taxes?  Play guitar.  You're fucking brilliant.  You're brilliant.  Terrible.  Oh, man.  Terrible.  And they play classic rock now.  I was listening to them online when I found out Rocco died, and I thought...  Dude, I'm dead.  I thought the radio station would do the right thing and maybe talk about it.  They didn't talk about it at all, which was really strange, because, you know, in the  heyday when we were up there and the station was doing really well, he was part of the 
[00:04:30]  lineup, so you would assume that they would do something for the guy.  Yeah.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Not a mention, but I was listening online to see, you know?  And they're a classic rock station, basically.  And then they play some kind of newer rock, sort of, and then kind of a lot of the 90s  shit.  You should see what...  But they'll play Jethro Tull now, which is strange to me.  Yeah.  That's weird.  You should see what the jazz station is doing.  Saxes and Taxes.  Oh, shit. 
[00:05:00]  Final extension.  Oh, yeah.  It's great.  I'm going through the alphabet right now.  Yeah, right.  Let's see.  What else do we do?  Yeah.  The only thing I can get, but it's not a show, is Faxes and Taxes.  Faxes and Taxes.  We're taking it retro.  We're taking all your requests by fax.  And it's Faxes and Taxes.  It's going to be great.  Yep.  What kind of songs are they playing for Axes and Taxes, Dave?  I would say some Van Halen. 
[00:05:30]  Is this an Axe song?  Oh, this is Axes and Taxes right here.  You sure?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  This really gets my 1099 going.  Come on.  Give me a song list.  All right.  Wait, is this their lineup?  Wanted, Dead, or Alive?  Burning Down the House is not an Axe song.  Yeah.  You know they can't commit, because the research doesn't show.  No, no.  They can't just do Axes and Taxes. 
[00:06:00]  They can't even commit, so they've got to throw their regular horse shit in there, like  burning down the house.  Which is a great song, by the way.  I do like some talking heads.  But it's not an Axe song.  But it's not an Axe song, is right.  And the Sweater Song, is that an Axe song?  I don't think so.  And the Crater Will Rock, that Axe is full in the rain.  That's an Axe song.  Sweater Song is no way an Axe song.  Really?  What is the Sweater Song?  By Weezer?  Oh, Weezer, yeah.  I'm done.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  What about, keep going, scroll down a little.  Scrolls, scrolls, scrolls. 
[00:06:30]  Renegade by Sticks?  They're playing Renegade by Sticks.  I told you, that's about the lawman.  The lawman's looking.  I know.  Oh, mama, I can't hear you.  Yeah.  Fearful.  On the long arm of the law.  Hangman is coming down from the gallows, and I don't have very long.  No, you don't.  The jig is up.  I like that part.  Of course you do.  I like this dopey song.  I do, too. 
[00:07:00]  I like Renegade by Sticks.  The old mama part I could do without.  Oh.  Oh, the harmony kicks in.  Yeah.  This is great.  Somebody's, like, sleeping right now, and they're just waking up.  There's a whistle.  Clock alarm.  It's like, ah, this is so nice.  Nice, gentle harmonies to wake me up.  Ah, I like waking up like this.  Ah!  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  They just scream, and now it's rocking. 
[00:07:30]  There's the axe.  And here's the axe.  Yeah, man.  She's a toxic.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was part of that world, but way too long.  Boy, does it stink.  Yeah, you're home of rock and roll.  God, if I ran a radio station up there, I would just laugh at this.  It's ridiculous.  I would make all my jocks just laugh at AF today.  Yeah.  They follow up Sticks with Alice in Chains.  Rooster, right? 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  I like the Rooster.  And then Low, Ra, Duh.  I'm hearing that song a lot lately.  Is that part of a soundtrack or something?  Must be.  That's what I know about.  I've been hearing Lowrider a little more than usual.  A little more than the usual.  Take It Easy by the Eagles?  Yeah, man.  Wow.  This is fucked up.  You want to scroll a little more?  Scrollage?  Scroll.  Let's go with this song for a second.  Yeah.  Where's the accent here?  A little bass.  Are they taking a break from it?  It's a horn.  Yeah. 
[00:08:30]  Whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip.  Uh, yeah.  Wow.  AF is a completely different animal.  I told you.  Look.  No Sleep Till Brooklyn into Magic Carpet Ride.  What?  Steppenwolf?  I wouldn't mind that.  Yeah.  That's not a bad segue.  No.  But, you know.  Very strange.  Weird.  When I was coming up in music radio, you would never do Beastie Boys into Steppenwolf.  No.  You wouldn't even dare to do that.  That would be crazy. 
[00:09:00]  Black Betty's in there.  I'm back to.  Is this an accent?  This is.  Let me hear when it kicks in.  I love when they just used to make.  What instrument is that, by the way?  That's like an echoplex.  That's all it is, right?  Yeah.  I think it's like one of their wacky effects turned up too loud.  What instrument are they playing through that?  I think it's a guitar.  Oh, wow.  Jink, jink, jink, jink, jink, jink.  Yeah.  You used to take those, um, an echo, it was like an echoplex, I think it was called.  It was actually a tape inside. 
[00:09:30]  It was a tape, a loop of tape.  Wow.  And it would record what you're playing and then play it back.  And you could vary the speed and everything.  And it used to be, it may have been to make a feedback and go like, jink, jink, jink, jink, jink, jink, jink, jink, jink.  That's kind of cool.  It was pretty creepy, but, uh, yeah, a real tape.  Not many bands use that effect.  No, my brother used to have one, though.  It was pretty fucking cool.  You'd open up the thing and just see if this piece of tape spinning inside.  And then the Leslie, see that keyboard?  You hear that?  Yeah.  It's like a Leslie cabinet. 
[00:10:00]  They used to have mechanical things for things that are digital now.  It was a speaker inside a cabinet that literally spun around.  You know what?  So it would give you this Doppler effect of like a, what kind of a sound.  It's weird.  You're a bit ahead of me, because as you were talking about that, I was about to jump in  and say the last time I saw the Allman Brothers at the Beacon Theater.  Yeah, yeah.  I was lucky enough to be on the stage to the side in these seats.  And I was just amazed by the spinny thing.  The spinny fucking speaker, yeah.  And Greg Allman's organ.  Isn't it weird?  It's a huge thing that just spins out of control. 
[00:10:30]  It spins around and it gives you that Doppler effect.  So it makes the keyboard sound like, wah.  It gives it that real 60s sound.  It's a great sound, man.  Yeah, yeah.  It's cool.  When is it happening?  I'm listening.  You can hear it going like, wah.  Right there.  It's not so much during this part, but there are some songs where it's like crazy.  What's his name?  We used to play keyboards.  Was it John Lourdes?  That was a keyboard player for like Deep Purple or something.  But Deep Purple used to have it a lot. 
[00:11:00]  Allman Brothers, absolutely.  Really cool, though.  Axes and Taxes.  All right.  Axes and Taxes.  Are they having any special programming?  Or is it just Axes and Taxes where they every once in a while play a song that has an axe in it?  I'd love to hear their production for it, too.  I bet it's Axes and Taxes.  Can we get some production elements from WAF, the station that used to rock?  Yeah.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Den, den, den, den, den. 
[00:11:30]  Any other radio stations doing special shit for Taxes?  They gotta be.  Remember when we broadcast live, though, outside the IRS?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, the post office.  It was outside the post office for Tax Day with AAF.  We were talking to people like, hey, let's talk to Bob here.  He's doing his taxes.  He's coming in.  How do you feel about your taxes?  Oh, man, it sucks, you know.  Oh, but, ha, ha, yeah, yeah, it sucks.  We're outside the post office?  Yeah. 
[00:12:00]  In the rock bus?  Yeah.  I'm trying to find a way to mail my right arm.  Ah, because.  I do remember we were in the back having lovelies rub all over us.  You know what?  That was the only thing.  That was our excuse for doing any remotes with AAF was the fact that there'd be young girls nude in the rock bus.  Shut up.  You're gonna ruin us.  You're gonna ruin it.  I think the statute of limitations is gone.  Oh, yeah, I don't give a fuck about my ex.  Oh, my God.  Crazy.  You're right.  That was great.  Made it?  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam. 
[00:12:30]  Is this an axe?  It's got a bam, bam.  Yeah, that's an axe right there.  There's an axe in here.  I fucking love this song.  Yeah, it is.  I'm so happy right now.  It is a good one.  I don't know what it is.  It is a good one.  It's a good goddamn song.  And that spider bait, their version of it,  where they really fucking go for it?  Yeah.  God damn it!  That's what you have to do,  is pick some songs to keep me happy.  This one keeps me happy. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, listen to this version for a second.  Yeah, yeah, that's good.  They made it their own.  Yep.  I love when bands can make a song their own  when they're covering something.  This is another song that movie trailers use  all the time now.  Do they?  Yeah, it's a go-to song.  There's a lot of those go-to songs  that you hear in a bunch of different movies. 
[00:13:30]  Listen to that.  Turn that up.  I like how distorted the vocal is.  Sounds like Troy Kwan yelling into the mic.  Now, what effect is that?  That's just heavy distortion on the vocal.  That's cool.  So what, is he eating the mic?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, they can do it digitally, too.  You just make it sound like  there's much too much gain on it.  Nice. 
[00:14:00]  So it's Tax Day.  Taxes.  All Lead Belly's song.  Like Betty.  Oh, yeah, I've heard...  Do you have Lead Belly's version?  The white man just fucking...  Just touching.  Snatching off of it.  But a few of these songs needed to be pumped up a bit.  The white man put on it.  You're right.  There's a Steppenwolf song.  Was it, uh...  Which Steppenwolf song was a big, uh...  Yeah, listen to this.  I mean, come on.  Who turned the mic on outside? 
[00:14:30]  The homeless guy down on the sidewalk.  Jump steady, black bitty.  Bam, bam, oh, black bitty.  Bam, bam, oh, black bitty.  You know that slap you hear in the song?  Yeah.  It's his actual dick he's slapping into his hand.  People don't know that.  Into his hand like a blackjack.  People don't know that, though.  He wanted to do something special.  Wow.  Bam, bam, bam.  Oh, black bitty.  Bam, bam.  Oh, black bitty.  This song needed to be pumped up.  Bam, bam, bam.  Black bitty.  I like how...  Whoa!  It started off like...  Whoa!  Like, oh shit. 
[00:15:00]  Little thing went crazy.  Bam, bam.  Little thing went crazy.  Bam, bam.  Oh, black bitty.  I need a Bambalance.  Oh, Black Bambalance and a Bambalance.  I need a Bambalance.  You don't like this song?  No!  I like this.  This just sounds like some guy rambling on the sidewalk.  I love it.  He probably had to clap his hands because he probably broke his guitar against somebody's head.  He had some problems, huh?  Yeah.  I'm more amazed that anyone heard this and thought they could make something good out of it. 
[00:15:30]  As opposed to listening to this and saying it's great.  Come on, Eileen.  The white man is amazing.  Yeah.  He's had some buildings, like Billy.  Yeah?  Yeah.  He was great.  I've heard a music version, I think, of this by him, too.  I don't think this is his only version.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, Black Bambalance.  I wonder how these guys sounded before they started recording them.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  There was someone that came before him.  There's no recordings of the guy.  Black Betty was really black, too, I guess, during this song. 
[00:16:00]  Like, when he was singing about her, she went Black Betty.  Black Betty.  Nice.  No mocha Betty there.  Black Betty.  Yeah.  I just want to say black.  Oh.  Oh, good.  Yeah.  Sam has a prep burger list.  We haven't talked about prep burger.  Oh, wow.  Prep burger!  Yeah!  A prep burger list of what?  Bad tax day suggestions?  Yeah, just in case, you know, you guys wanted to do a tax day.  By the way, people pay for this service.  Yes.  It is a pay service that jocks get delivered to them every day. 
[00:16:30]  Wait, are we paying for this?  Not right now, no.  Is this the free sample?  This is the sample.  They give samples out so you can look and go, shit's gold, Jerry.  It's gold!  Like a good drug dealer would give you a few samples.  Yeah, get you hooked.  Get you hooked on the laps.  Get you hooked on prep burger.  Yeah.  Why don't they call it round team?  The cup's round.  The jar's round.  Dude, we should do a week of prep burger.  Prep burger.  A week of prep burger.  You know what?  That sounds like a great idea. 
[00:17:00]  You know us, though.  Within an hour, we're like, all right, enough of this.  Okay, we'll just do a day of it, then.  It could be very funny.  Oh, my God, right?  After, like, an hour, we'd be like, fuck.  I can't take this.  But, guys, we planned five days of this.  Yeah, did we?  Let me prep a show for you using prep burger.  Prep burger.  But that would mean we'd have to prep for a show.  I'll do it for you.  You want to prep our show?  Yeah, why not?  We're using only prep burger.  Yes.  That would be really fun.  You want to do that?  We should do that.  Yeah.  Let's do it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's not tell the people which day it is.  No.  We'll do it in, like, two weeks. 
[00:17:30]  Don't know.  It'll be the good one.  You know, they really stepped their game up.  Oh, management should be come over.  You know, today's show was really good.  Yeah.  I liked how it was, you know, laid out.  You know, you need to do more shows like that.  You think management threw a party yesterday?  Oh, my God.  Oh, boy.  They went dancing.  And I bet they went dancing.  I don't know who I got in that horse race.  Dude, I had the same feeling, man.  That's a tough one.  Mixed reviews.  Yeah.  I was happy about him losing because for stock it might be better. 
[00:18:00]  And I got stock.  And selfishly.  But, you know.  Howard lost his what?  Lawsuit?  They just missed it.  Everyone's talking about it.  I reckon so.  Of course.  We can at least fucking talk about it for a minute.  He was asking for, I don't know, $300 million or something like that.  And he was thrown out of court yesterday.  Yeah.  So, you know those douchebags down the hall were fucking partying.  I think their contention was that he, it was all over bonuses from what I gather.  And when XM and Sirius merged, violent takeover of XM satellite radio. 
[00:18:30]  Wait, can I slow you down for a second?  Yeah, yeah.  Because you're going there?  Yeah.  If it was a merger, who from XM still works here?  Yeah, exactly.  Besides us.  I'm in murders and executions.  What?  Wiki.  And us.  That's it, right?  And Wiki Wicklin, who must have fucking naked pictures of every big wig around here.  That's it, right?  And Bob Edwards, maybe?  Ron and Fez?  There's one other guy who he, I'm not going to tell you what his name is because he told  me what it's like in D.C. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, it must just be.  It's not what it was.  It's like a defeated country.  Yeah.  Because they are a defeated nation, so it's just they're walking around like Japan fucking  blurring out pubic hair.  So you're right about the violent takeover, because when it technically merged, there  were some really good XM people that they kept, but they're fucking closed-minded and  thought their people were the best, so they pushed out a lot of very talented guys.  They really did.  I'm sorry.  Yes, they did.  But anyway, violent takeover.  Yeah, after the violent takeover, and then it becomes one company, it looks like Sirius 
[00:19:30]  got a fuckload of new subscribers.  But they were actually the XM subscribers that were kind of, you know, brought in to  the fold.  Right.  And I guess Howard's contention is that, hey, those are new people, so I should get a bonus  based on the amount of people that were coming in.  And Sirius is like, no, these are subscribers from the company that we took over that, you  know, they were saying you had nothing to do with bringing in. 
[00:20:00]  And so, yeah.  I think he filed right after the McCartney concert, where they were celebrating 20 million  Sirius XM subscribers.  Right, right, right.  So once they made that announcement, he was like, well.  So that was the whole thing.  And I guess the court said, you know, agreed with Sirius and said, no, these are listeners  that were already there.  Yeah.  The merger.  Merge.  Oh, God, stop it.  All right, back to Prep Burger.  Oh, Prep Burger.  These are ideas for tax day for some radio stations out there. 
[00:20:30]  Because I'm the tax man.  Isn't that Voss's music?  Didn't he used to come on to it?  No, he used to walk on to Paperback Rider.  Paperback Rider.  Why Paperback Rider?  Well, that was when Bonnie made a great joke.  She said it's so ironic because he's never read one.  He's not well read.  That's funny.  He's really not well read.  Tax man.  Certainly not.  Cause I'm the tax man.  Yeah.  I'm also the axe man.  Yeah.  Oh, nice.  I like that.  I fit it in. 
[00:21:00]  I shoehorn it in.  God, the Beatles are great.  Oh, my God.  Be thankful I don't take it off.  Yes.  Take it off.  No Buffett rule.  No Buffett rule.  Ooh, Ringo.  Did you hear that?  That was him.  Oh, yeah.  He's fucking kicking ass on this song.  Wow.  And he doesn't want to sign autographs anymore, huh?  Oh, fucking Ringo was rocking on this one.  How did Ringo ever do?  Oh.  Sit there shaking his dumb head while he's fucking playing. 
[00:21:30]  Now I'm going to have to hear from the Beatle people.  What a dolt.  He stepped in the fucking best shit ever.  Every day he should jerk off from fucking looking at Pete Best's picture.  I can't believe it.  I can't believe I was one of the Beatles.  Yeah.  Neither can anyone else.  Nope.  The genius of fucking Lennon and McCartney.  Harrison, too.  Fucking Harrison.  Yeah.  Harrison, too, man.  And the old Beat Keeper.  And then there's rumors that when he went home, some things happened in the studio. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, well, later on with some of the more complex albums and Sgt. Pepper, yeah, they  listened to his drum tracks and were like, get this shit off.  Can we get a real drummer in here to spice this shit up?  Ringo would be like, I'm going home.  Put a run in there.  I'm going home.  I never realized, listening back, how good of a drummer I was.  I listened to the tracks and hear Phil's I don't even remember putting in.  They would make sure he left early and they would lock the door, throw away the masters 
[00:22:30]  and start over.  Wow.  There's rumors.  There's rumors.  Rumor had it.  Rumor had it.  Lionel Richie owes a million dollars in back taxes?  Yep.  Holy shit.  Talk about the tax, man.  Yeah, they're coming for Lionel Richie.  Hello.  I do like that song.  Is it me you're looking for?  Yes, it is.  It is you we're looking for.  Yeah.  Give us our money.  Pam Anderson, half a million dollars she owes in taxes.  Oops. 
[00:23:00]  Half a mil.  Oops.  She's got to cough up so it could be used stupidly.  Oops.  Yeah, true.  So true.  Hey, man, we were doing axes and taxes and now we're fucking not axes.  You like this shit?  Fuck yeah.  What do you mean, fuck yeah?  I'm filling out my new 1099.  Did I pay my taxes?  Hell no. 
[00:23:30]  This is blacks and taxes.  Blacks and taxes.  Blacks and taxes.  Blacks and taxes.  I didn't want to go with blackses.  Blackses.  I thought that might have.  Whatever.  All right, let's do the prep burger.  Well, let's help some radio shows out there.  One thing we could do.  Now it's me they're looking for.  I can see it in your eyes.  How dreamy.  Yeah.  It's a dreamy song.  You're getting laid. 
[00:24:00]  Sing the shit out of this.  I want to hold a girl's chin while I mouth the words.  Just her chin.  Cut off her body as she lays bleeding, screaming across the room.  No, I want to hold it between my thumb and pointer finger with my nails, pinching her chin skin.  Pinching her chin?  Yeah.  Would she be smiling at you?  No, she wouldn't.  She would be horrified?  Yeah.  I'd be in her house in a home invasion just singing hello at her.  This is a good one. 
[00:24:30]  All right, let's do this.  What do you got for the radio shows out there?  Well, today you could broadcast from the post office and offer tax survival kits.  Oh, that's good.  Some swag?  Pepto-Bismol, aspirin, and the name of a good lawyer.  Ah, that's great.  That's good.  Oh, my God.  Who the fuck would do that?  Guys, I'm a little worried about the Pepto-Bismol, actually. 
[00:25:00]  If we could just say bismuth, that you're using a generic bismuth, because we couldn't  get a buy from Pepto, and we don't want to...  Okay, I'll get back to you on this.  Oh, God.  All right.  Shut up.  Get an old white refrigerator, paint it like a 1040 form, park it on a flatbed truck in  front of the post office, and allow people to take swings at it with a sledgehammer. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, guys, we ran this through legal.  It's a little dangerous with the sledgehammer, so we're actually going to take a Nerf dart  gun and let people shoot it with that, but everyone has to wear goggles.  The eyes are very vulnerable.  Okay?  So we're still working out with legal, but we'll get back to you.  Everyone has to wear goggles.  It's just, you know, I want to laugh along with you, but it's so sad.  It's too true.  It just brings back too many memories of shit they've told us. 
[00:26:00]  But you're implying that they'd ruin it.  Yes.  That is something they would actually tell you.  Of course it is.  Oh, my God.  Here's one.  Hold on, E-Roy.  Didn't you guys have people come and take swings at a Bronco?  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  Yeah, with a sledgehammer.  Same concept.  See?  We fucking ruled.  See?  We fucking...  Everyone's ripping us off.  Here's one labeled always a favorite.  Oh, always a favorite.  Yep.  The IRS dunking tank.  Uh-oh.  Let listeners try and dunk an actual IRS agent and relieve those frustrations. 
[00:26:30]  Wow.  Yeah, guys.  There's no way we can ever get a real agent.  So we're just going to have one of the interns dressed up like an agent.  And he'll be that.  So don't say anything to listeners.  We don't want to make them think we're lying to them or anything.  But it's going to be that.  And the level of the water.  Yes, the level of the water cannot be over the intern's head.  And we're not even sure we can use it.  I don't know.  We might have to scrap this whole idea. 
[00:27:00]  I'll get back to you.  They were making, like, waist deep or something.  Yeah.  Just ruin everything.  They just suck.  They can't just do something.  Where are these guys in this building?  I want to punch them in the face today.  This one is one we'll have to run by the lawyers.  Uh-oh.  W-X-X-X.  In our case, it would be the Opie and Anthony channel.  Right.  Got our refund and blew it on you.  Station personalities armed with a leaf blower full of dollar bills blow money through open car windows of folks waiting to drop off returns at the post office. 
[00:27:30]  Wow.  That I don't like at all.  That sounds cool.  Look, this could start a riot.  But even that, I mean, just the money flying out, there could be paper cuts and lawsuits.  We can't risk it.  We can't risk it.  Okay.  Fucking management.  All right.  If you have a Pofolks restaurant in town.  Pofolks?  Do a special tax day remote offering cheap food for poor folks.  Finally.  Pofolks. 
[00:28:00]  Is that a name of a real restaurant?  I guess.  Or is it just like Red Lobster?  Oh, there's...  I don't know.  Yeah.  Red Robin?  Set up a typical spin wheel and put cash amounts on it.  Listeners show up holding a completed 1040 to play.  The wheel could include cash, stamps for mailing the 1040, tax preparation for next year, etc.  That's a pretty good idea.  I like that.  You like that?  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:28:30]  Can we make it our own, though?  Can I get the call letters in there?  How about we put the call letters up on the spinning wheel, too, so when it hits the call  letters, they win like a grand prize?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good.  Uncle Paul's nephew on Twitter.  Oh.  Let's do smacks is, smacks is, I guess, and taxes.  Chris Brown all day.  Chris Brown day.  Oh, God.  Any more, Sam?  Yeah.  Shirt off your back day, since, you know, it's tax day and you got to pay, you know. 
[00:29:00]  Do a clothing drive.  A clothing drive.  Nice, warm, nummy.  Is what it says here.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Nice, warm, nummy.  Nice, warm, nummy.  Mm-hmm.  What is that?  I don't know what that is.  I don't know.  What's a nummy?  I don't know what a nummy is.  It says nummy.  Can we look up what a nummy is?  Get it.  Yeah.  God, these awful fucking ideas.  These are funny.  Yeah, okay, you're right.  All the rest of the April ideas are April Fool's Day ideas. 
[00:29:30]  Oh.  One of them said that the mayor died in a horrific car accident while having a young, what was  he?  Haitian boy in his car.  Was that part of that?  People always forget that was also the kicker, was that he had a young Haitian boy in the car  with him, Mayor Menino.  Oh, they forget that part.  It was so, like, it was so overshadowed by the horrific crash that they forget that  we actually said there was some type of young, ethnic, child boy in the car with him. 
[00:30:00]  Can you find a clip of that, E-Rod?  Oh.  I need to hear that.  I forgot that part of it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's an April Fool idea?  April Fuels Day.  April Fuels Day.  April Fuels Day.  Let me tell you, you're going to the gas station, right?  Yeah.  You're giving away gas.  That's correct.  But then, when they get there, you actually, it's because it's safe for fools, you douse  them with the gas and throw a match at them.  Right?  That'd be fucking great.  You watch them burn.  Oh, jeez.  Chip loves the gas station. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, fuck, I love that shit.  Oh, here's one.  Yeah.  Announce the time one later, one hour later than it really is, in parentheses, if it were  a weekday, you'd have a lot of missed showers.  Oh, wow.  Oh, they give an example of the ensuing hilarity?  You think they get phone calls?  Oh, my God.  That's what I would hear.  You can't do it the other way, because then people would be late to work, and it would be 
[00:31:00]  very bad.  We can't do it that.  Why don't we do it the other way?  So people, no, no.  We can't.  If people are late to work, they're going to get fired, and we could be held liable.  You got to do it early so people hear that and go, hey, they said the wrong time.  Yeah, exactly.  So they look at their own fucking clock and watch and go, no.  They're digital clocks.  Yeah.  They're never wrong.  Change the alarm clock.  You'd still wake up on time.  It's not a bad idea, though.  A lot of blacks would be on time for once.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  You could also...  Blacks is in Texas. 
[00:31:30]  Blacks is in Texas.  You could also trade air staffs with another station in town.  In parentheses, best, if not direct, competitors.  Well, of course.  That's crazy.  Yeah, but wouldn't that be the best thing to do?  Of course it would.  You idiots where you're brave enough to go, you know what?  I fucking hate that guy.  He hates me.  But let's just do this for one day.  They would do it with a station that's under the same corporate umbrella.  Of course.  You know, like CBS would do.  It has to be a CBS station.  No one would notice because it's the same droning hacks. 
[00:32:00]  Jesus.  By the way, someone on Twitter reads, who needs a prep burger when you have the mashup  on Hits 1?  Oh, shit.  You just answered the question.  That's who needs prep burger.  Oh, no.  They use prep burger?  They don't do any bits.  What are they doing for taxes and axes?  Let me go.  Ask them.  Oh, my God.  They got to be doing something for tax day.  Right?  They seem like the type of fun show that would do something for tax day.  Of course. 
[00:32:30]  What are we doing for tax day?  This.  We're goofing on other people that actually worked to do something for tax day.  We're like pilot fish on a shark.  Shut up, man.  We just sit there hoping to get crumbs.  We're fucking barnacles.  From the thing that's really doing the work.  We're just slowing down boats everywhere.  We're sucker fish on the side of your tank.  Stupid barnacles.  Anything more annoying than barnacles?  We're barnacles on the hull of ships that are actually doing something.  You ever get scraped by a barnacle? 
[00:33:00]  Oh, barnacles suck.  Swim around?  By the pier?  How the fuck do they appear like that?  I don't know.  They are amazing, though.  It's really strange.  The barnacle.  Oh, what's up there, Sammy?  What's happening over there?  They said they'll mention it today, but Stanley T. looked at me and said, no, no, man.  This is a hot show.  We don't do lame bits for tax day.  Well, I'm sorry.  Someone seems a bit uppity.  Someone seems like they want to be on a show that they're not on. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, he wants to be on Shade 45 so bad.  Oh, man.  Does he, Stanley?  Oh, you got to think that he's just waiting for Sway to give him the call.  Yeah.  Stan used to do radio in Philly, man.  He was like a Philly dude.  Really?  Was he a tough guy?  I'm sure he is.  He was a local celebrity down there.  Yeah.  He was big down in the Philly area.  He's from Brooklyn, right?  By the way.  I think he was born there, yeah.  Will you do me a favor and watch game four tonight, please?  Um, no.  Please.  No.  Put it in the background.  Um, no. 
[00:34:00]  The Penguins fucking Flyers game tonight is going to be, dare I say this, epic.  Epic.  I don't like using the word epic often.  A lot of people overuse the word epic.  It's going to be epic.  It's the new literally.  It's going to be an epic game.  Yeah.  It doesn't matter if you like hockey or like any of those teams.  It's going to be a sick hockey game tonight.  Please watch.  Please.  Jimmy, would you watch hockey?  I use epic at the wrong time.  Uh-oh.  Oh, what happened?  I don't mean to.  I'm like, hey, where did my epic socks go? 
[00:34:30]  I'm like, what makes socks?  Give me some epic marmalade.  No.  No.  We will be talking about the Flyers-Penguins game tomorrow.  I'm telling you, because some shit's going down.  Some shit is going down.  Well, I watch it.  I don't know if I remember.  I'll forget, to be honest.  These teams don't like each other.  Flyers are up three games to Zippo, and they want to fucking beat the shit out of Sidney  Crosby.  Oh, stop now.  Did you hear that?  It was my imagination.  That was your imagination. 
[00:35:00]  I forgot to turn my phone back.  Wow.  Who is that?  I know.  That sounded very like, ooh.  Oh, it's Wednesday.  I remember what I said about the Flyers and the Penguins.  Oh.  It's on tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  Right?  They're taking two days off?  Oh, I'm an asshole.  I'm an asshole.  No, you're not.  You just made a mistake.  Wow.  That sucks.  Who's playing tonight, then?  Rangers played last night.  That was a solid hockey game.  I'm just going to talk to myself for a second. 
[00:35:30]  I saw the game last night.  Rangers shut out the Ottawa boys' one zip.  Oh.  It was a really good hockey game.  It looked like they were going to come around in the fourth thing.  That game's tomorrow?  Yeah.  Coyotes, Blackhawks, it's tonight.  I don't care.  All right.  Yarg.  Do we got club soda?  Can he sing in a song or something?  Yeah.  What is this? 
[00:36:00]  Oh, I hear there's a new...  What is this?  Because I want to take a break.  New bit.  Because I want to get to Bob Beckel.  Good old Bob Beckel.  Is there food here yet?  Where's he going to talk about food?  I'm hungry.  Damn hungry?  What did you do last night, Jimmy?  Nothing.  I went down to the cellar and never spawned.  I'm such a dummy.  Why?  Why are you a dummy?  Because I thought I had one.  Oh.  I'm so stupid.  You guys want to learn something about the barnacle?  The barnacle?  Do you?  Yeah. 
[00:36:30]  This is something I did not know.  What about the barnacle?  It's Megan.  We like Megan.  She calls from time to time.  She's from the D.C. area.  Megan.  Hi, guys.  Hi, Meg.  The barnacle has the longest penis in the animal kingdom relative to its body size.  Where is the fucking penis on the barnacle?  It's 43 times its body length.  They can't move, so it has to stick way out and go into another barnacle, and they're  hermaphrodites.  Ew.  And they're hermaphrodites? 
[00:37:00]  What?  Yeah.  Wait, you missed the best part.  They're hermaphrodites, and they do what?  So they can fertilize each other, because one will send out its penis to the other, and  it'll send its penis back.  Does barnacles like to suck each other's cocks?  I guess you could look at it that way.  How much would it suck to be a barnacle on the bottom of a boat, and another barnacle  sticking its giant penis in you?  Especially one you don't like, and it's reaching over three hot barnacles, so fuck you.  And you gotta think, there's one lonely barnacle. 
[00:37:30]  The barnacles on the outside are waiting for their penis.  Where's his penis?  Right?  Right?  Right?  Oh, that thing sticking out is the barnacle dick?  Barnacles are awful.  But they got big dicks.  Look, it has a head and everything on its penis.  Where's the balls?  Probably cupped in the barnacle area.  Really?  Like the barnacle sack area.  There's no room for a brain if you got a penis that big.  That's right.  You don't need a brain with a cock like that.  You just swing it all over. 
[00:38:00]  You're really the king of the ocean.  That's so true.  They just hang out on the ship and drag their big dicks all over the water.  So they just shove their big dicks into each other?  Their big barnacle dicks.  That's why they get on a boat so they can just go from fucking hub to hub and show their  big cocks off.  And what about the barnacles on the outskirts?  Are they just like opening up their bungholes waiting for their big dick?  Let's give me some lonely barnacles on the outside.  What?  I said they're not monogamous, so, you know, they can just wait their turn. 
[00:38:30]  But do they fall off the ship or something?  No, man, their barnacles are a motherfucker.  But how do they pick a plane?  Do they just get born on their ship and stay there like assholes?  I don't know.  There's people that make a lot of...  Well, they're larvae and they settle and then they attach and they grow.  Where do they settle?  How do they...  Like, what if I had a barnacle on me?  That would suck.  There's companies that make good money scrubbing barnacles off the bottom of boats.  Imagine they're getting scrubbed off dick first.  Like you're minding your business and your big dick gets hit by a fucking...  Some guy in a scraper. 
[00:39:00]  Wow.  I did not know this, that they have large penises.  Forty-three times the size of their body, huh?  Yeah, but they're all length.  They're not girth.  Who is the tiny penis in the animal kingdom?  Yeah.  Oh.  Relatively speaking or literally just...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The barnacle.  I think gorillas have pretty small ones relative.  You don't have to explain.  The barnacle.  Yeah, I need to know who has the tiny peener in the animal kingdom. 
[00:39:30]  And why did they just say it's 50 times or 40 times?  Who said it's 43 times?  Exactly.  We're not going to measure ourselves.  Yeah, yeah.  We'll trust you.  Then it's got to be give or take.  Who's the scientist who's fucking on fucking barnacle dick measuring duty?  How do you get that gig in the scientist community?  Oh, yeah, they go on whales, too, right?  I thought it was Opie's brother.  Huh?  I thought it was Opie's brother doing that.  Well, my brother is a marine biologist.  He certainly could...  He'll probably text me way too much about the barnacle now that we mentioned it. 
[00:40:00]  He likes to do that.  They measure...  Who's got two inches?  Gorillas.  Gorillas have two-inch cocks?  Yeah.  Wow.  That's why they're so aggressive and ordinary.  And there goes that theory, then.  Wow.  Oh, jeez.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Two inches?  Two inches.  Two inches of love right there.  Did you say now you know why they're so fucking angry?  Yeah.  You said it already?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Ornery cranky.  Ornery right, yeah.  Look at them.  Just all embarrassed. 
[00:40:30]  And that's why they get on all fours.  They don't want anyone checking out their tiny penises.  They're trying to hide it.  How embarrassed was King Kong as he was climbing the side of the building,  and every floor people were going,  aw, look at his little dick.  Aw.  Aw.  You had to hear that 110 times.  All right.  All right.  Thanks, Megan.  Wow.  Two inches.  We learned about the barnacle penis today.  Yeah.  Sam, I hope you get a call about that when you do, 
[00:41:00]  what did we learn?  Getting better.  That's probably so they can't rip them off in fights.  Oh, man.  Because they go for, like, apes,  and, like, I know chimps go for balls and stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  Fishes.  So the dicks are probably all fucking frightened.  Yeah, they're all constantly scared.  Yeah.  Sucking in.  Nobody wants a big cock in the fucking gorilla community.  Oh, man.  Because that's the target.  Yeah, you just grab it and rip it off anyway.  Yeah, around the water cooler.  It's crazy.  You heard what happened.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  If you were in a plane crash.  His dick ripped off.  On the side of a mountain, 
[00:41:30]  and you had to eat your pal's balls to survive,  would you do it?  Eat your balls.  Sure.  If the crash was in such a bad way  that the only thing left was his balls,  would you eat them to survive?  Sure.  Yeah.  Even if help was on the way.  Even if help was on the way.  You make believe you don't see the helicopter.  Yeah.  This is fucking pretty cool right here.  What happened?  I guess they're taking the shuttle to the Smithsonian.  Oh.  I heard we're getting one. 
[00:42:00]  Are we?  We might get one, right?  Yeah.  So they're flying it on top of a 747  from the Cape up to Washington.  That's pretty fucking cool.  Piggyback that thing.  Wow.  Who thought that would work?  And it did.  How did that not blow off?  Who fucking thought that would work?  I just don't get it.  It's just too much weight.  That's heavy.  I don't understand.  When you look at a fully laden 747,  you think,  a lot of people in there.  That's got to be heavy.  Nah, 
[00:42:30]  you could just strap a space shuttle  to the top of it and fucking...  Where is it?  When does something become too heavy  to get in the air?  Oh, man.  I don't know.  Obviously,  based on the engines.  Yeah.  Can we continue to just make powerful engines?  Like,  bigger and bigger?  Where we're flying some crazy-ass shit in the air?  I'm sure there is a point  where it becomes too big  for even a bigger wing.  It's going to suck if it blows off.  It blows off.  Imagine if they just put it there  and they didn't nail it down or anything.  Nail it down! 
[00:43:00]  Like,  even if they did nail it down,  why is it nailed down?  Is there a guy in the shuttle?  I doubt it.  That would be great.  Why?  That would be the coolest thing ever.  That would be a cool ride.  Just be like,  whee,  I'm in the shuttle.  I mean,  this country needs money.  Some asshole would have paid a million dollars  to sit in the shuttle  as they're bringing it to the...  Where?  Oh,  Washington?  Yeah.  Smithsonian.  I thought you were supposed to get one  on the Intrepid.  Oh,  the Intrepid Air and Space Museum.  Where's that?  Here?  Yeah. 
[00:43:30]  The big aircraft carrier  down on the west side.  Right.  Why is it so slow?  What the...  Was there a fucking traffic  in front of it?  Take off.  Just sitting on the runway.  It's just sitting there.  What are they,  chit-chatting?  A niner,  something niner.  Yeah,  there's probably some dope  that doesn't know  what's happening.  Flight 682,  there seems to be something  on top of your plane.  Might want to have that checked out.  Now,  they would know  because they all work  for the agency.  The agency,  huh? 
[00:44:00]  Yeah,  even the people on the news  are now watching  just going like,  oh God,  we went with the shot.  We have nothing to say.  And there's,  it's just sitting there  on the runway.  Now they show you  at a faraway angle.  I bet they need  a really long  fucking runway.  Yeah.  That's got to be  a little bit of room  to,  it looks like  plane rape.  That's what plane rape  looks like.  Plane rape.  That's some barnacle shit  right there.  Now all the news stations  have it on.  Do you want to go with,  right south to north  and then lift off here  and start heading down?  Do you want to go 
[00:44:30]  with Stephen Mishkin?  He does aircraft  wing balance.  Oh!  You want to do this  real fast?  All right.  We could get a little  physics.  Steve,  real fast  because this thing's  about to take off.  What do you got?  Real,  well it weighs about  37 empties,  about 83,000 pounds.  Put your shirt.  Moving.  October of 1990,  2020.  It's going slow.  What,  a good drive there  or something?  See,  I don't pay your tolls.  Here's your hat.  I forgot.  Fucked up.  You would have said  to me just a minute.  Wouldn't it be cooler  if they just put it 
[00:45:00]  on the highway?  Yeah.  I'm great with that,  man.  That is a fucking  heavy load,  man.  I'm not.  Wow.  It's hard.  It's hard.  That's a long runway.  This is for you guys  and for everybody here  to the world force.  I would gather  they got to get  a little bit of lift  from the actual  shuttle too,  right?  It is.  I mean,  it's got to be  I think I hear it.  It doesn't look  that fast.  No.  Take a look.  It's off.  Here we go.  What the fuck?  It's still got,  wow,  that is a long 
[00:45:30]  fucking time.  There goes  the nose wheel.  Get the fuck out.  Look,  it's lumbering  into the sky.  It is lumbering  into the air.  Oh, man.  I'd be,  I'd like to,  it's a great shot  right there too.  Wow.  Nose on.  Look at that.  Yeah,  I know.  It's clear in the trees  here now.  We've seen this before.  Heading down  to the south.  That's what they used  to do before  while they were  testing the shuttle.  Bob is going to go  down the beach,  fly down the beach.  You're going to fly  actually over pad  39A, right? 
[00:46:00]  Oh, the beach.  Turn around  and come back by  and fly over  the maxi pad.  Yeah, I know.  Why don't you land  like a period of something?  That's fucking cool.  That's fucked up.  We've seen that  before though, no?  Yeah, yeah.  They used to do that  when they tested  the shuttle.  But every once in a while  where they,  oh, they'd have to  bring it back  from like Edwards Air Force Base  or something.  I wonder if you know  what it is.  The shuttle probably  needs too much room  to land too.  Plus, I don't think  it can take off with this.  How does that feel  you think if you're  on the plane? 
[00:46:30]  Man, I bet it just  feels like you have  a space shuttle  on the roof  of your plane.  All right.  That looks so weird.  It's fucking cool  that they even suggested  like, how are we  going to get the shuttle  back when we have  to land it in the desert  and bring it back  to the Cape?  Well, we could just  pop it on top  of a 747.  Crazy.  No, we can't do that.  Is that a special  747 thing?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  The tail looks different  and it's probably got like,  it's probably stripped  on the inside.  Oh, really?  Big fucking engine.  You don't think  there's a bunch 
[00:47:00]  of empty seats?  They actually sold it.  There's people on the plane.  Yeah.  They sold the seats.  Yeah, I don't mind  the shuttle on the roof.  All right.  We're going to break.  Today is tax day.  So do whatever  the fuck you need to do.  That's what I say.  We got Vic Henley  coming in at 8 o'clock.  Yeah.  A funny guy.  I like Vic Henley.  Yes.  He hasn't been around  in a while.  And, uh,  said Vinny.  From the Jersey Shore.  We told him to come back  when his book came out.  His book came out.  How come we don't have 
[00:47:30]  copies of it?  Said Vinny.  I'm sad.  Or do we?  I think we might.  No one gave me copies of it.  Jimmy's a reader, man.  I know.  I'm still in that  Clint Hill book.  It's fucking amazing.  Jimmy's well read.  Yeah.  I'm going to read a book.  When?  Soon.  Oh.  I know what my next book is.  What is it?  I mean, if I'm going to finish  a couple that I started,  I have to finish them.  Would you read a whole book  on barnacle penises?  I would love it.  I'd read one and write one.  I would write to  conflict the opinion.  Whenever that says,  I'm going to write the opposite.  Can we learn more  about barnacle penises? 
[00:48:00]  I think there's more to learn.  Yeah.  I really do.  About barnacle penises?  I think there's more there.  Oh, no.  Donald, you're flying.  Ah, there he is.  You're flying.  Did you do that show?  Yeah.  In a second.  Yeah, I know.  It's a good show.  It's not a good show.  It's your best show.  It's okay.  It's really good.  God, I feel like an idiot.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, a girl in the car.  What happened?  Is that it?  There was a girl in the car?  When?  I thought we said  there was a boy in the car  with Menino.  I thought it was a girl, too. 
[00:48:30]  Oh.  I think we wanted to go boy,  but the news reporter  Well, we did want to show  some responsibilities.  Yeah, yeah.  I hate the hairdo  on the fucking Morning Joe chick.  She has a cunty hairdo.  Yeah, she does.  That really is a cunty  cunty fucking hairdo.  That hairdo just yells cunt  really loud out the window.  What, on the Morning Joe?  Her hairdo is cunt.  It's just a cunty cut.  Me and Ant, you were gone, unfortunately. 
[00:49:00]  We did an hour on those two.  It was some of our finest work ever.  Think he hates her?  Well, that's what we were getting at,  but then the dumb times  comes out with an article  where it hints that  they kind of like each other.  He had to say that.  You think?  Yeah.  He's not allowed to trash her, remember?  We had a whole angle on it, man.  It was fucking terrific.  Well, her hairdo is just cunty.  That's what she said  when she goes into  the fucking beauty palette.  I'll have the cunty.  Yeah, let me have the cunty  with a little over the ears. 
[00:49:30]  Terrible hairdo.  Fucking helmet hair.  Can you dye it twatty  while you're at it?  Yeah, cunty do with twat dye.  Twat blonde.  She's a good fuck, though.  She's horrible.  No, she's probably a dirty sub.  Ah, yeah, probably.  Fingers in her ass.  She fingers her own ass?  I'm guessing she likes them in there.  Like a digit or two?  Yeah, but she likes  thick construction worker hands.  With calluses?  Yeah, like man hands.  Oh, there's fucking 
[00:50:00]  there's fucking old  fucking red lips ink  on fucking CNN.  Yeah, that guy again.  Yeah.  Why?  He looks like a tranny.  Yes, he really is awful.  He's doing a lot of the commentary  about, uh...  Oh, is he a lawyer?  He looks like he has  mascara on, too.  Look at this.  Look at his red lips.  Integrity.  Were you surprised  that she waited  to be asked  versus immediately  when it was clear  that you're...  Is that Soledad?  She stinks, too.  Well, my...  Wow, she's pretty,  that fucking judge. 
[00:50:30]  That's a judge.  Damn it.  My time at Chapstick.  I wouldn't mind  being found guilty  with her.  Yeah.  Let's see what I did there.  I wouldn't mind her  hitting my balls  with her gavel.  What?  I don't know.  Wow.  She's pretty.  Hey, when we get back,  please don't go anywhere.  I mean, we got you.  You know, you're a subscriber,  so it don't matter.  But it does matter today  because we have Bob Beckel.  Bob Beckel.  You gotta hear Bob Beckel  after the break. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah, I love this clip.  You love it, right?  I love it.  Good old Bob Beckel  got himself into a situation  on Hannity yesterday.  A good situation.  And then he panicked  over his situation.  Yeah, he did.  We're gonna play  Bob Beckel next.  And about me sounding  like a white supremacist  over the past week or so  since Obama was elected,  I'm seeing things 
[00:51:30]  that are happening outside.  I'm experiencing things myself.  This isn't my imagination.  I am being bullied.  That is just what's happening.  And here we go number two names.  Come on.  Now I've been listening  on the radio  to what's going down  on the O&A show.  Obama's got Anthony's  tickets in a twist.  Yeah.  Something about the blacks  and the guns in his fist.  Wow.  Guessing them best.  They gonna take  Ant's guns away.  Robbing the rich  for the black man's  fat and death.  Wow.  That's just crazy  if you think for a second. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  Now why the fuck  would I want Anthony's  check unless I'm getting  to show me  for chicken to smell me  on the sweet radio show?  Yeah, that would sell me.  But am I getting paid?  And I'm a president now.  That's right.  But I'm not taking this crap.  I'm not taking this crap.  I'm not taking this crap.  We're moving on.  But I'm not taking this crap.  And give it all up to me. 
[00:52:30]  That's what you do.  You're a hot profile radio host.  Dude, I can't take this anymore.  I can't take it.  It's the United Negro  call me a bond.  A chicken in every bed  and under 21.  So turning the guns  for the comic brands.  And the Starbucks  for the great soda machines.  Gonna get me fired  but to punch it in.  And Anthony's gonna  have to take it on the chin.  I'm bumping in the crackers  at Toasted Clear.  It's the black man's time  for a terror and a death. 
[00:53:00]  Don't worry about  the mortgage  old paying your rent.  Obama's got your back  cause he's heaven sent.  And when he's done  improving my life  I'm gonna have more money  than that's actually life.  I'm not joking.  This is what we're dealing with.  In this country  you've been allowed  to voice that opinion  and then have a dialogue  about it with other people  who disagree with that opinion.  That's great.  It's a great thing 
[00:53:30]  but we've gone to this point  where you just  you can't do that anymore.  It's um  it's no  hey  Obama president  nah  that's what the president's  gonna do for you?  Now you can walk  in front of white people's cars.  I'm sick of it.  Do you need a baby aspirin  or something?  Shut the F up.  I was blind  but now  I see  Obama president  nah  Sirius XM  This is the 
[00:54:00]  Opinion Anthony Show.  I love when they put  a little nigga in it.  Oh gee  why?  What happened?  That's what's going on here right? 
[00:54:30]  Uh huh.  GGA  GGA  They take a song  and then they you know  you start here  in the beginning of it  and you're like  oh this is that song  and then you're like  oh  and he's saying it too  so I can say it.  Of course  it's in the song.  It's part of the rules.  Is that the rules?  They're always changing.  In person.  A negro  I guess that's for tax day  Iraq  we don't need your sweeper today.  Flaxes and taxes.  Flaxes and taxes  that's what we're doing today.  Stupid morning mashup. 
[00:55:00]  Sorry they were walking  by the studio.  I want their job.  What do they do?  It's so easy.  They just wander around.  They just walk around.  You gotta go to their show prep.  It's so easy.  It's like school.  They're like the people  at school that were done  with their classes  and they just like  they're just ready  to graduate  so they just walk around.  Stanley T what's up?  He didn't hear you.  Why ain't he walking  with the rest of the cast?  He's probably made. 
[00:55:30]  I'm made today.  I'm made.  He's giving us the love.  Yeah.  Give us some love.  You're giving him  the devil horns.  It's the easiest.  That's the white thing to do.  It's the easiest job here.  Well we have three hours  of radio to do today right?  Three more yeah.  Three more.  They're not even gonna  talk the amount  we just did.  Oh my god.  For the whole week.  They do maybe 15 minutes  an hour.  Of talk?  Of talk.  Maybe.  And they do three live hours.  Can we do a tribute 
[00:56:00]  to the mashup  and do a show  based on their show  so we could just  talk for a couple of minutes  and I think that'd be fun.  See technically  it's a six hour show  but what?  Which three live hours  and then just replay  on the same day.  And they make believe  that no one notices.  That's right.  Oh I see.  Let's get to Bob Beckel  please because we got  a lot of people  coming in today.  We got Vic Henley  very funny comic  and Don Henley  Vic.  Oh that's different.  And we also got  Vinny from the Jersey Shore. 
[00:56:30]  Vinny?  He's a pal of ours  and he's got his new book out  so he's gonna help  some people out there  control the crazies  is the name of his book.  He's probably listening  to us right now  because he's on his way in.  Well and on the cover  he's standing in a peaceful  hands folded pose  in the street  while there's a blurred  vision of traffic  around him  which probably  symbolizes craziness  going on around him  while he remains calm  or attempting that.  Do you think that  represents the crazy?  I think so sure.  I would have represented 
[00:57:00]  the crazy differently  I think.  Me too.  The guy banging  a fat chick.  He's crazy.  You wanna hear Bob Beckel?  I wanna hear Bob Beckel.  Bob Beckel.  You've done Hannity  with Bob Beckel?  A few times.  Hannity,  Red Eye  I did with Bob Beckel.  You know the Bob Beckel?  Oh yeah.  I like Bob Beckel.  I didn't think I would  but I really do enjoy  Bob Beckel.  Yeah.  He's a fun guy  to chat with.  Yeah.  He's a boisterous  bullshit bastard.  Oh that guy.  Kind of has like that 
[00:57:30]  John Candy  Chris Farley  type thing.  Yeah.  He wears the spenders  and he's a Democrat  but he really has  a unique little take  on things  and he's  batshit crazy.  He used to be  a raving alcoholic.  Oh really?  And drugs.  He's talked about it.  He's talked about  his past.  He was  who was he with?  Jimmy Carter or something?  Who the fuck was he with?  I don't know.  He was with one of the  one of the Democrats there 
[00:58:00]  who was like  working for  not sure  let me see what it says.  Who was he working with?  Career.  Oh.  Oh Mondale.  Mondale.  He was Walter Mondale's  he worked on his campaign.  Yeah.  Well that didn't work out too well.  Campaign manager  for Mondale.  I don't remember  hearing President Mondale.  No.  No.  Oh Walter Mondale. 
[00:58:30]  He got wiped.  49 states  to one  they lost.  No.  Mondale Ferrara.  Yes.  Lost to Reagan.  But that's impossible.  There's states where they  they wow  really?  They even lost  Mondale's home state.  I don't remember  which one they won.  Yeah that was  what they call  the landslide.  They were  they were scared  of the broad.  Landslide election.  We weren't ready  for the broad.  No.  Especially not  Geraldine  with her shady husband.  Why was Walter Mondale  was he like a real liberal? 
[00:59:00]  I don't remember  much about him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  America had just  come back.  It was four years  of Reagan.  So America  had just come back  from the fucking  Carter administration  where we were  the laughing stock.  We were powerful again.  Reagan like  restored some pride  in the country  and shit.  And then you get  this guy  who was another  Jimmy Carter.  Wow.  And people did not  want to have it.  It was Dunsky.  That's amazing.  49 to one.  Yeah.  Because this election  coming up is  me and Ann 
[00:59:30]  were talking  it's going to come down  to just a couple  swing states.  That's it.  Didn't he say  he was going to  raise taxes too?  Yeah.  Mondale said  I'm going to raise taxes.  Like he was honest  and they punished him.  He told everybody  don't tell the truth.  And we bitch all the time  that these guys  aren't honest.  Well I guess  when you are honest  that's what happens  right?  We got to play  the Mitt Romney clip  trying to convince people  that he is funny  and he pulls pranks.  I can't stand Mitt Romney.  Please find that clip.  I forgot about it.  Oh right.  Yeah yeah yeah.  Because he's talking 
[01:00:00]  about SNL.  Because there's rumors  that he might do SNL  but I don't think  that's a real possibility.  They asked him  who's funny  or him or Obama  and he's like  I don't know.  I don't know  I haven't heard Obama  being funny  and anything like that.  He goes but  you know  people don't really  know me either.  I'm a funny guy.  The pranks I pull  with the pranks  he pulls with his friends  he was talking about.  Imagine  how great they are.  Imagine you at the cellar  with your boys  at the table  and you talk  Mitt Romney sits down  and everyone goes  whoa look out  here comes the heavy guns. 
[01:00:30]  You talk about  the pranks you've pulled  to kind of show  everyone at the table  how funny you are.  but imagine  if he had  the best ones  like you say  I was sitting there  with Keith  and Mitt sat down  and said  one time  I had one of these  he pointed at Keith  pretend to be  my neighbor's  new neighbor.  Oh  I put a bunch  of them in there  I said go over  introduce yourself  as the new neighbors.  Some girl  falls asleep  at a party 
[01:01:00]  writes cunt  on her head.  He's a crazy guy.  He did a lot of pictures  of Mitt  with his cock  hanging out  by people's  his friends  passed out mouths  tea bagging  putting his ball bag  on the bridge  of their nose  he set moose shit  on fire  on people's  fucking cabin  steps  knocks on the door  and runs off  except he would  do it really bad  like he would  set the front door  on fire  and when they came out  just throw dog shit  at them  he got it wrong  but he did it meaner  he used a lacrosse stick 
[01:01:30]  we'll wait to hear  the clip  try to convince people  that he's funny  it's horrible  him and Obama  not funny  not even close to funny  Obama's a geek  and he's  he's just a  fucking  out of touch  he's a nerd  we've said it a million times  on this show  Obama is a nerd  Obama's a nerd  I don't know  what category  but Romney  falls into this  fuddy-duddy category  thinks they're fun  thinks they're funny  I don't know  you know what 
[01:02:00]  it gets me  every time I read  like on Twitter  I think somebody  didn't like  Ricky Gervais'  tweets about being  on the show  and the  dicks on chicks  and shit like that  and she wrote like  oh the language  enough  bye  and like  unfollowed them  and then her profile  on Twitter  was like  love fun  laughs  and having a good time  it's like  no you fucking  don't  shut the fuck up  you're the  fuddy-duddy 
[01:02:30]  that everyone  hates being around  you think you're  funny and fun  but you're not  you're just not  funny really  so Gervais says  something funny  but it  you know  not your cup of tea  and you're like  well you had to write  bye  you had to be heard  you couldn't just go  just go  but boy  I bet you're a  fucking genuine  pisser  what a load of laughs  you must be  and you see that  all the time  people are  you know what  that's not appropriate  and then it's like 
[01:03:00]  love joking  love having laughs  you really don't  you're dull  unfunny  miserable  and fucking  your friends hate you  alright dude  I'm trying to change  Jesus  it's getting uncomfortable  in here  Bob Beckel everyone  Bob Beckel  this is what happened  with Bob Beckel  on Hannity yesterday  it's a curse word  god if you haven't  heard this yet  I'm not  oh  here it is  fuck it  head start is a failure  you don't know  what the fuck  you're talking about

[01:04:00]  and shits  and what not  in check  it's very difficult  sometimes  because on here  you're just used to  you know  whatever comes to your mind  like I wanted to say  fucking cunt  but I said  fudgy  fudgy wudgy  carbuncle  do we curse a lot  on this show  you think  I don't even know anymore  in natural  I remember when we  first started on the satellite  we couldn't help ourselves  we were really peppering  our speak  with a lot of curses  I remember  I was intentionally  throwing in a bunch  of fucks and stuff  and we were so conscious 
[01:04:30]  of it too  like you would say  fucking  and it would be so weird  because just to have  the microphones in front of you  and be in this environment  you're like  it's just  it didn't feel right  you were waiting for them  to turn off the whole  so it was awkward  channel  yeah  now it's just  you know whatever  you just talk  I don't even know  if we curse a lot  I have no idea  alright  Bob Beckle  so yeah  it was live on  head start is a failure  you don't know  what the fuck  you're talking about  whoa bleep  what are you doing  failure  I can't  I just can't stand  right wingers  I love all the time
