<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast on February 26th, 2002, began with Opie and Anthony discussing their rising ratings in Washington D.C., jokingly comparing the improvement to a "dead cat bounce."  Anthony then recounted an embarrassing bathroom experience during a high-profile meeting, focusing on the awkwardness of needing to use the restroom and the subsequent questioning about whether he'd put the toilet seat down.  They mentioned a visit to the Gotham Bus Company to see Mr. Marshall.  A game segment followed, with callers guessing the topic of a meeting the hosts had (which was revealed to be about the show's future).  Several callers participated, some offering commentary on Anthony's toilet seat incident.

A bizarre directive from Jeremy Coleman to "camouflage" the studio's green room to prevent identification dominated a significant portion of the show.  The hosts humorously brainstormed increasingly absurd solutions, including blindfolding guests and wearing masks.

The show then shifted its focus to the upcoming "55-gallon drum challenge," a contest with a $2,000 prize.  The hosts detailed previous contestants' feats: Becky from Brockton (ate chocolate-covered lamb eyeballs), Stephanie from Taunton (blew bubbles in a toilet with feces), and Double LC from Cleveland (performed a self-administered headstand while masturbating).  In the studio, Sarah, an 18-year-old from Cleveland, prepared to eat lamb brains from a skull.  Frenchy, a show staffer, graphically described preparing the lamb skull on-air.  This segment also included graphic descriptions of the process, Sarah's reactions, and the hosts' commentary.  Opie shared stories about his high school years, including extensive truancy and marijuana use. The "F.U. line" call-in segment featured listener messages.  Jamaica Mike, a parking garage attendant, made a cameo.  The "Naughty Nighty" contest was also briefly updated.

The "Naughty Nighty Contest," a month-long competition with nearly 100 entrants, was concluded. Five finalists – Lisa (Boston), Stephanie (Washington D.C.), Daniela (Sacramento, also featured in Penthouse), Amy (New York), and Nikki (Sacramento) – were interviewed.  The hosts discussed the contestants' appearances and personal lives in sexually suggestive terms.  Stephanie from Washington D.C. won a trip to Hedonism 3, while Daniela from Sacramento took second place.  Callers reacted to the results, sharing unrelated stories, including celebrity sightings (Iron Sheik, Hulk Hogan).  A listener questioned the authenticity of a lamb's head prop in the studio.

Further discussion of the "Naughty Nighty" results followed, with callers expressing strong opinions on the outcome. One caller vehemently criticized Daniela not winning, while another celebrated Stephanie's victory. The hosts speculated about potential voting irregularities.  The show featured more listener anecdotes, including a bizarre plane encounter with the Iron Sheik and a sighting of Rowdy Roddy Piper handing out tacos.  A segment was teased where a woman would be sprayed with lamb blood from a Super Soaker.  The show also reminisced about a brutal gym teacher ("Giblets") and his sadistic dodgeball games.  Finally, the show satirized Earl, a black man, attempting to ski for the first time, using racially charged jokes about his potential performance.  Future segments involving the "Naughty Nighty" winner were teased. The show ended with a musical outro by Drew Boogie, featuring remixes incorporating audio clips from previous shows, including a remix based on a call from Buddy Epson, and discussion of upcoming plans that include using super soakers filled with animal blood.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hello. And welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show. Hi. For this Tuesday. Tuesday. October 17th, 2001. How are ya? Nah, just kidding. We're here. We're live. It's a nice day in New York. It's Tuesday. It's, uh, I don't know. February 26th, right? February 26th, 2002.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area. 877-692-1027. Anywhere else, including, well, including Washington, D.C. D.C. Opie, I do believe D.C. was showing a little, um, well, they call it a sign of life. Yes, there's a sign of life in Washington, D.C. as far as the Opie and Anthony Show goes. How nice is that? 
[00:00:30]  Hey, man, it's just a sign of life. It's, uh, yeah, yeah. Slow down. We're not getting carried away, but, uh. 
[00:01:00]  This life form is not ready to do some effing. It's just nice to see the plummeting stop.  Sometimes the heart, uh, wants to feed a few more times before it's finally, well, maybe that's it.  Stops. The dead cat bounce. Dead cat bounce.  You're looking at your grandma in the hospital bed, and, ah, she died. Ah, she died. 
[00:01:30]  But she was getting better.  But then all of a sudden, as you're walking out the door, you see on the monitor, beep.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  What happened?  And then you look a little closer, and you see, like, uh, like a heartbeat going through those veins of hers.  Yeah.  Like a, like a, like a beat there, like a pulse.  Yeah.  Going through her blue, uh, veins that you can see, because her skin is so transparent at this point.  Sign of life.  A little sign of life.  It was nice to see. 
[00:02:00]  Actually, as, um, month to month goes, it was a marked improvement.  I felt very good.  It was a marked improvement.  I'm feeling love from D.C.  Still in the crapper.  Oh, yeah, don't get any, you know.  It's going to take a little while.  But it looks like we're climbing our way out of the toilet bowl.  Yeah.  Just a little bit.  That's nice.  Speaking of toilet bowls, I think I left the seat up.  Look.  I, I, how long ago did we leave? 
[00:02:30]  Two hours ago?  Three hours?  I, I think I left the seat up.  Wouldn't you, wouldn't you?  I, I told him I, I put it down and he asked and I, I, I, I think I left it up.  Is he going to call me on it?  You know something?  He might.  Because if he asked, which he did, if you put the seat down, if you left me alone to go to the bathroom.  Don't you, how long is a meeting supposed to take?  Can't you time it out where you don't have to get up and take a leak in the middle of the meeting with Mel? 
[00:03:00]  I, I, I, I didn't time my, uh, coffee and water intake before, uh, going, uh, up to the top of the world.  And he leaves me alone.  I'm like, could, I, I, where's your bathroom?  Well, like, what is, where are you going?  Can I explain a little bit?  Yeah.  When you're, uh, when you're taking a trip that high into the stratosphere, I, I was assuming that, uh, I needed to drink a lot of water. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, did you?  They say if you're going to, like, climb Mount Everts, Everts, uh, you, you need a little water.  You gotta, you gotta drink some water, do you?  So I, uh, I, I had my coffee and my water and we're in the middle of this intense meeting and, and, uh, he, he was talking about something I know nothing about, revenue.  So I said, uh, I need to take a leak.  Yeah.  I held it as long as I could, eh?  And then.  And Opi had to go so bad that he says, um, I, where's your bathroom? 
[00:04:00]  And he goes to the bathroom and, and then, uh, Mel turns to me and goes, what's he gonna throw up?  What, is he sick?  Yeah, is he sick?  I'm like, what?  No, I don't, I think he's just gotta take a leak.  Oh, you know, Steve's gonna call me or something and he's right.  Uh, Bill Hicks.  Sorry, Steve.  That one line about the grandma with the, the blood and the rye.  In her blue transparent veins. 
[00:04:30]  You're right.  Bill Hicks rocked.  I wasn't thinking I was gonna, uh, recite Bill Hicks when we went into this, but you're right.  Oh, we got audio of that.  Of what?  Oh, yeah, I, I do, we do have audio of me in, uh, the bathroom, man.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That better not have been.  Oh, I'm sorry, that, that's the wrong audio.  No, thank God.  That's the audio of what, uh, we thought of, uh, the radio station we broadcast on in New York. 
[00:05:00]  I'm sorry.  No, stop it.  Wait, I can find the other audio of me in the bathroom.  All right.  No, sorry, I didn't time it right.  I'm sitting there.  You see me squirming like I'm like a, like a six-year-old kid?  Yeah, that was really bad and embarrassing.  And I finally had a, uh, you know, excuse myself.  And then I get out of, out of this, uh, unbelievable bathroom.  The first thing he says is, did you put the seat down?  Um, and Opie just goes, yeah.  And I know damn well you, you, you didn't think about it long enough to give an answer. 
[00:05:30]  You just said, yeah.  You would have had to, and I, I know you probably don't put the seat down.  Well, you probably don't lift the friggin' seat up to go in the first place.  Did you lift both seats or just do it like on the part you sit on?  To be honest, I, I didn't touch the seat and I left a little on the, on the seat.  Oh, no.  To show them who's, uh, boss.  Yeah, great.  You don't leave any, you know what? 
[00:06:00]  Here's what I would have done.  First of all, I never would have put myself in the position where I had to use the bathroom.  I couldn't help it.  It's just a bad move.  I, I, I was starting to get the stomach pains.  That's how bad it was.  Bad move.  You talk to anybody that, uh, knows anything about corporate meeting, you do not leave to go to the bathroom.  And then secondly, if, if, if there was some emergency where I had to go,  you make sure you lift both seats up, you go, and then you, you take some toilet paper and wipe off that rim.  No stray hairs, no driplets anywhere. 
[00:06:30]  Check the floor.  You leave that just the way you, you went in.  Did you notice?  And put the goddamn seat down.  Did you notice how long it took me to get back out of the bathroom?  No, I didn't notice because I was there alone now talking finance.  The hell do I know?  It was like, uh, that scene of Risky Business.  You're looking at the clock and it starts going backwards.  Oh, click backwards, a tick.  Like, yeah, what am I going to add as far as finance goes?  The guy's been on the cover of Fortune magazine and everything else.  And I'm, I'm sitting there.  And I, I'm like, bar. 
[00:07:00]  Dude, I got some, uh, really nice souvenirs though.  What did you, don't even, don't even joke that you took anything.  I got a few things.  A few things.  I got a few things.  But, um, some nice towels with a big M on it.  Yeah.  Hand towels.  So, uh, yeah.  I, I, I, I think I put the seat back down and I've been freaked ever since.  The OCD kicked in as soon as we hit the street.  I'm like, uh, I, I, I, why would he ask such a question? 
[00:07:30]  Is he going to call me on this someday?  Uh, uh, so, yeah, we, we had an interesting morning to say the least.  Yeah.  We were pretty much on, on top of, uh, the world.  I think we were in the tallest building that's still standing in New York.  Something like the 50 something floor.  Overlooking like three states it seemed like.  Yeah.  You can see ground zero like it's right there. 
[00:08:00]  The Empire State Building, you can, we felt like we could reach out and touch it.  Very nice of it.  And we didn't have to, we didn't have to go into the conference room where you see the big 666.  Went down to the Gotham Bus Company to see Mr. Marshall.  Hey there.  Hello, Bill.  Hey there.  That was the line, yeah.  Oh, Doug's got it, yeah.  Hey there.  Hey there. 
[00:08:30]  Tom, what's up?  What are you doing?  Tommy.  Hey.  Uh, yeah, it sounds like, I hope he sounds like, uh, Michael Corleone having to get up  in the Italian restaurant.  No, yeah.  I gotta go to the bathroom.  Did he have a, did he have a gun hidden behind the toilet just in case?  No.  Well, someone planted one, but we, uh, we felt like we didn't need to, to go to extremes today.  It was, uh, very nice.  It was nice to, uh, go to a meeting and not, uh, be yelled at.  It was nice.  We're not used to that.  So.  And after yesterday's show, I'm very surprised that didn't happen. 
[00:09:00]  Uh, all right.  Andy, what's going on?  Just want to know, Opie, how many towels did you steal?  A couple hand towels.  That's nice.  And a cute little, uh, little, little soap thing in the shape of, like, a shell?  Like a shell.  Was it a little clam shell piece of soap?  Yeah.  Can you put them out there on eBay so we can have a chance to buy them?  I took one.  I mean, they had a whole little bowl of little, uh, I don't know, shell soaps type things.  Yeah. 
[00:09:30]  So I took one.  Nice.  All right, Andy.  Later.  Bye.  Uh, Tom, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I want to play Guess What the Meeting Was About.  All right.  Guess what the meeting was about.  Okay.  I'm saying that you got to invite the other shows to the island so they can suckle off  your teats and they can get fed.  Uh, no, no.  That wasn't what it was about.  No.  Nope.  Damn.  Eh.  Oh, well.  Later, guys.  Uh, only one guess per person.  Uh-huh.  No, that wasn't it at all. 
[00:10:00]  One guess.  Now, we're not really going to play that, are we?  Why not?  Sure.  That's what the meeting was about.  Jeff, what's going on?  Uh, I think I got the wrong number.  I was looking for the Brewer-Baldwin show.  Later, faggots.  What a dick.  Very good.  All right, Ed.  Why don't we, um, why don't we, um, do a radio show now?  Yeah, we can do that.  Because we're able to.  Because, uh, doesn't look like the station's going to, uh, blow up anytime soon. 
[00:10:30]  Uh, yeah, we learned that today.  Yeah.  Uh, Frank, what's going on?  What's going on, guys?  Hey, Frank.  I was wondering if old Mel Carmson is kind of like LBJ.  Does he talk to you while he's sitting on the commode?  No.  No, no.  Very class act.  The LBJ used to do that.  I, I, I, I did hear that.  Lyndon Johnson used to, uh, have meetings on the bowl.  To show his power and his masculinity over people.  Yeah, he would be, uh, taking a, uh, a crapper. 
[00:11:00]  A crap.  And he'd have the door open and he would be, uh, having meetings.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I, I read that somewhere.  All right, you guys.  Take it easy.  All right.  We can tell you this much.  Um, you're listening to, uh, two very powerful guys right now.  Oh, yeah.  Anthony is the, uh, new head of, uh, Blockbuster, I believe.  Yeah, he gave me Blockbuster Video as a goof.  And, uh, I don't think I'm going to have too much more time with the radio show because  I, I, I think he kind of talks in circles and stuff.  Yeah.  But I think I'm in charge of MTV now.  I think I'm the new head of MTV. 
[00:11:30]  See, I was under the impression they gave you, uh, VH1.  I didn't think it was MTV.  It sounded like VH1.  VH1 instead of MTV?  Yeah.  It's kind of, you know, meh.  I thought it was Lifetime.  He did say.  Did you get black entertainment television?  He did say I was in charge of videos.  I'm just happy because now I, I don't have to pay any more late fees at Blockbuster.  All right.  Well, there's some more people want to guess, I guess.  Aaron, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Am I going to have to be changing my presets in my radio station? 
[00:12:00]  Wrong.  Try again, dumbass.  Nope.  Nope.  All right, guys.  Take it easy.  Your pals will be staying right where they are.  Yeah, there's nothing.  Uh, Nick, what's going on?  Hey, fellas.  How's it going?  Hey.  I think I know what you guys are going to have to be doing.  All right.  Playing some real, uh, snazzy Linkin Park songs to, uh, boost up the ratings a little bit.  Some more music.  Some alternative rock music.  Wrong.  Try again, dumbass.  It's really kind of anticlimactic.  We will not be playing music. 
[00:12:30]  There's nothing, uh, it wasn't a meeting that, uh, was going to change anything.  We learn about it.  We learn we're doing just fine.  Yeah.  Just fine.  All right?  All right.  All right?  All right!  All right!  And we're going to kill Linkin!  Right?  You know.  Let's go to Jeff.  Jeff!  You're on, uh, Opie and Anthony.  What's going on?  Yeah, I want to guess what happened at the meeting today. 
[00:13:00]  Oh.  All right.  I want to guess that you and Ron DeFant's got to do 12-hour shifts now.  Wrong!  Try again, dumbass!  No, sir.  Thank you.  Thank you, Jeff.  No, sir.  All right, Ant.  Uh, another thing we got to, um, talk about before we move on with the regular show is something  we heard, uh, that they're, they're starting to do, how can I explain this?  Uh, we, we heard something just before we walked down the hall.  Yeah.  Um, Steve comes walking into our office from foundrymusic.com. 
[00:13:30]  This is part of the...  I guess he's also the maintenance man around here or something.  Is Steve the maintenance guy?  Oh, hold on.  I've got to answer Kevin's question.  Kevin?  Hi, uh, I just wanted to ask Opie, uh, how old is Mel?  56 years old.  Thank you.  You're a jackass.  Well, remember, they said I was going to have to guess his age.  Guess his age.  Right.  I was right on, wasn't I, Ant?  You were.  So, anyway, uh, Steve from foundrymusic.com, he's also the maintenance man around here. 
[00:14:00]  Look at the tool belt he's got on now.  Yeah.  He comes in looking for a hammer into our office today.  This is how insane the people have gotten around here.  This, uh, edict came down from who?  Jeremy Coleman, right?  Thank you.  Thank you.  Jeremy, uh, said, get, get what Steve is supposed to do.  Camouflage.  Camouflage the big room, the green room, we call it, outside of the, uh, studio where everything 
[00:14:30]  happens, where most of our photography and video is taken of, uh, lewd and crude acts  of, uh, things that we've done on this program.  Camouflage the walls with tarps so that when you're taking pictures and videos, no one  will know where it was done.  Bingo.  Because we don't want them to think it actually happened here at the station.  It wasn't necessarily tarps. 
[00:15:00]  It was just something to cover up.  Some type of camouflage.  I wanted to do big blue tarps so I could maybe blue screen it out when I was at home  and maybe, like, put, like, a jungle picture or something.  Right.  I think at this point, Jeremy is going insane.  He's, that is the first sign of, of a lunatic, somebody losing their mind.  We got, they're watching.  People are, people are watching.  He thinks, uh, helicopters are hovering outside his office, too.  I've heard them.  Listen.  Shh, shh.  Listen closely.  I told you. 
[00:15:30]  The black helicopters, they look in the windows, and if we don't camouflage the studio, they'll  complain to somebody that naked women were here in the studio, so put up tarps or just  go to, go, go to Home Depot, get some paneling, put up different paneling every day.  He did not tell you to camouflage.  Why do you have Wednesdays paneling up on Tuesday?  Yeah, it was, it was just like that, uh, that bad Mel Gibson movie, Conspiracy Theory,  where he's got locks on the refrigerator. 
[00:16:00]  And the whole place is wired with explosives, just in case he has to blow it up.  God forbid someone sees a pair of boobs.  Coleman.  Jeremy Coleman.  Hey, James, this is a fine camouflage to use.  You just hang it on the wall and nobody knows anything.  Thank you, Q.  He's like a secret goddamn agent now.  But apparently, yeah, so, so any digital pictures and any video that was taken now...  He can't be serious about camouflaging the place. 
[00:16:30]  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  I don't know.  I'm trying.  Are we going to have to blindfold our guests so they don't really know where they are?  They won't be able to tell anyone where they came from.  Oh, you just gave a great idea.  Kind of like the bat cave?  Yeah, it's like the bat cave.  Well, like they do in Afghanistan, where they're taking someone to a secret location where the sheik is hiding.  I am trying so hard.  Rick, from now on, when our guests arrive on the 10th floor, I want you to blindfold them.  I want you to spin them around a bunch of times.  And I want you to have them walk the steps up and down so they don't really know where they are. 
[00:17:00]  Then take the elevator up and down a few times.  Right.  Yeah.  And then let them out into the studio.  And we'll take off the blindfold.  Of course, Ant and I will not be showing our faces ever again.  So that's why I'm wearing this really cool Mardi Gras mask right now.  Yeah.  I have the Halloween mask on, the one that looks like William Shatner.  Remember that one from the movie Halloween?  Yeah, see?  It's great.  That way, if we're photographed...  Wait, you mean you're really not Shatner?  No, no.  It's the Halloween version of Shatner mask.  I thought I got a new partner here for the radio show. 
[00:17:30]  No.  No.  I just thought William Shatner did good voices and he was doing Anthony.  And then while our guests are maybe talking after we pull the blindfold off, we'll run  up and cut their neck or something?  Yeah.  Yeah, do that.  All right.  Because you never know.  I'm trying to...  I'm so hard to do the reasoning behind this.  Like, what was Jeremy thinking?  What's the chain of events that could possibly happen from a picture with the studio in the 
[00:18:00]  background?  All right.  And then go.  What happens?  Someone sees it.  They see that there was a naked girl and does what with that?  And then the thing that happens is what?  What now are we looking at?  Well, I don't know.  The picture is taken.  There's nudity.  There's the couch that then could tip people off to the fact that they're in the WNW studios  here in New York.  And they do with this picture, what then what? 
[00:18:30]  I don't know.  No clue.  I don't know.  I can tell you it hasn't happened yet.  This is complete paranoia and it's completely unsubstantiated.  But you were searching for a hammer and you had a tarp in your hand.  Yeah.  Me and Rossi were walking around with a hammer.  And I look at each other like, this is not going down.  No.  He really wants to hammer up a tarp somewhere.  Do you know, there are shows that are actually on television that are based at radio shows 
[00:19:00]  that don't have to camouflage anything.  Everyone knows exactly where they originate from and stuff happens there.  So what's Jeremy's problem with a website where there are pictures that show the studio  in the background?  It's not like we're hacking people apart and hiding the bodies.  We're not.  These aren't crimes we're committing.  It's not like we're a crematorium.  That is really, really funny.  Melissa has a great idea though. 
[00:19:30]  Melissa, go ahead.  You're going to be making snuff movies in the green room now.  That's it.  That's it.  We're making snuff films.  And then the people are going to be able to figure out where we had the person killed.  This is better than preparing for a show.  People are losing their minds around here.  Steve's searching for a hammer.  There's two guys with a tarp.  I'm like, what are you guys doing with the tarp?  Yeah, Steve comes in.  And when he told us, we were like, you're joking, right?  Okay, what's the gag?  Yeah.  No, really?  I'm hanging this up.  We're like, no. 
[00:20:00]  No, you're not.  No, you're not.  That is silly.  Apparently, we're committing crimes here that have to be covered up.  We're covering up evidence.  All right.  Well, we're going to take a break.  We're just getting started.  Today's the big day, by the way.  Oh, we announce the winner of the 55-gallon drive.  Of the 55-gallon drive.  I'm ahead of myself, Opie.  The winner of the Naughty Nighty contest.  The Naughty Nighty contest. 
[00:20:30]  You have an hour and a half to get your last-minute votes in at opianthony.com.  Man.  And shortly after five, we will have the top five live on our show,  and we'll announce the places they all came in, okay?  Right.  So that'll happen in the 5 o'clock hour.  Before that, we got our latest contestant trying to qualify for the 55-gallon drum challenge.  She's here, right?  Her name's Sarah.  Her name is Sarah.  Oh, what's she going to do?  She's in the green room.  That still looks like a green room,  but we've got to put the tarp up.  Put the tarp up.  My God.  We still have to camouflage the place. 
[00:21:00]  She will be eating lamb brain.  Lamb brain.  Directly from the skull with a spoon, scooping it out.  Scooping it out, eating lamb brain.  And will she be doing this in any state of distress?  Yeah, she's got to.  Well, I mean, lamb brain, that's a piece of cake.  Eating lamb brain's like hot, but you've got to make it hotter.  And then tomorrow, Anthony, is the big day.  Oh, yeah.  Tomorrow, the girl comes in.  Bron panties.  We have super soakers filled with animal blood. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  I don't know what animal blood we're using,  because there's all sorts of questions.  Like, well, you can't use this because that...  I thought it was lamb.  Is it going to be lamb blood?  We'll find out tomorrow, but we're both going to have super soakers filled with blood,  and we're going to spray it all over.  Unload on her with blood and super soakers.  How cool is that going to look when it hits her and starts dripping down?  She's going to look like she's being shot.  She's going to look like Carrie.  Right.  And also tomorrow, continuing with the blood theme, 
[00:22:00]  we have this girl, Maria.  She's coming in tomorrow.  New York.  Oh, New York.  Finally.  Look at you, Maria from New York.  New York.  She's going to come in, and she's going to drink, I think, a pint of pig blood.  Stop it.  A pint of pig's blood.  So it's going to be a bloody show tomorrow.  Why haven't we spoken to her?  She's going to be on the phone in about a half hour.  Thank God.  Well, how about we call her after break? 
[00:22:30]  Okay.  Is that cool?  Yep.  So we've got lots to do today.  Also, more of your phone calls in the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including Washington, D.C.,  where there's a slight sign of life today for the Opie and Anthony Show.  A little pulse.  866-277-4WOW.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, it barely fits through the hole.  Just squeeze it through.  Squish it through.  Squish it through.  Oh, my God.  It's another kiss. 
[00:23:00]  That was a whopper.  Coming soon.  The return of the 55-gallon drum challenge on the Opie and Anthony Show.  And E.W.  System of a down.  Toxicity.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  In the New York area, give us a call, 877-692-1027.  Maria's from New York, Anthony.  And she wants to be a contestant in the 55-gallon drum challenge.  She's coming in tomorrow. 
[00:23:30]  Maria, what's up?  I guess you called when we were off the air yesterday, huh?  Yeah, I didn't get the email until later.  So, you want to come in and drink sheep's blood?  Pig's blood.  Oh, pig's blood.  Pig's blood.  They have sheep on the screen.  I wasn't sure if you changed your animal on us.  You ever done this?  No.  Why would you?  Wow.  Why'd you pick that?  I don't know.  It was an idea.  I didn't think of anything else, so I said, hey, why not?  Um, um, uh, well, she gets sick. 
[00:24:00]  Drinking pig's blood.  I know that, uh, if you eat raw pork, you can get, uh, trichinosis.  We need an expert on the phone.  Which is bad.  Um, I don't know.  I think you could probably boil it.  Ugh.  Can we get an expert to make sure Maria's going to be okay?  I would say not safe.  I have to say not safe.  Not safe?  If eating raw pork, that means we gotta do it.  If eat, well, yeah.  If you eat raw pork, you're gonna, you're gonna get effed up. 
[00:24:30]  So, I would think drinking the blood's the same thing.  Well, we'll get someone to call the show to find out.  Yeah.  Alright?  Okay.  Alright, uh, well, we look forward to seeing you tomorrow.  Hold on a line just in case someone is checking in now.  Alright.  Because of the delay, they're finally finding out that we need their help.  Alright.  Hold on.  There goes Maria.  She wants to drink pig's blood tomorrow, Anthony, to get in the 55-gallon jump challenge.  A couple instant feedbacks coming in.  Frank from Manhattan.  O&A.  Earl has the station hammer and is still hanging in those pictures in the lobby. 
[00:25:00]  That's why Steve couldn't find it in your office.  Oh.  And Dan from Hoboken.  We were talking about the ratings in Washington.  There's a slight, very slight sign of life.  Sign of life.  In the ratings.  And Dan from Hoboken writes,  The Washington ratings show about as much life as a girl 30 minutes after she leaves her cocktail alone with Norton.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It seems in Washington, January more gooder than December.  That's what we're hearing. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  That's what we're hearing.  We don't subscribe to the ratings.  No.  No.  So we need like spies and stuff to kind of hint that we may be doing okay.  More gooder.  And it is good to just see a nice little sign of life there like that.  All right.  Let's go to Pete.  Pete, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yo, they make soup out of pig's blood.  It's not like a dangerous thing.  I wouldn't worry about it.  Yeah, but don't they cook it?  They heat it up.  Don't worry about it.  Everything is edible on a pig. 
[00:26:00]  Hey, Norton.  Yeah, but if it's cooked.  Yeah.  What?  All right, Pete.  Thank you.  Norton's not here yet.  Let's go to Tom.  Tom, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, boys?  Hey.  You can't drink pig blood like that, man.  And Anthony's right.  You at least have to boil it.  But it's full of all kinds of toxins and crap.  You really will get sick.  It's a good chance you have to get AIDS already, but what am I?  See you.  Iris loves you.  Are you a professional, though?  No, he's not. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, all right.  Well, what are we going to do?  I agree with the non-professional.  Gary, what's up?  What's up?  You tell us.  She drinks that pig blood.  She'll get trichinosis.  You boil it, it'll coagulate.  It coagulates when you boil it?  Oh, yeah.  So then she'll have to eat it like it's pudding.  There you go.  Oh, lumpy, coagulated pig blood.  Well, let's see if she's up for the challenge.  It'd be like tapioca.  Hey, Maria.  Yeah.  Are you willing to eat the blood?  Because after we boil it, it's going to kind of harden a little bit there. 
[00:27:00]  It might get gooky.  It's going to gelatize.  You're going to cook it first?  We're going to cook it, so then you're going to have to kind of eat it with a spoon.  Get a heaping helping.  All right.  Yeah?  I'll do it.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Now, Nick is yelling.  Nick, what's up?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Hey, what's up?  Well, there hasn't been a case of trichinosis in 50 years because of the way they keep pigs  nowadays.  Because their poop doesn't mix with their flesh anymore.  Oh, yeah?  So we don't have to worry about the trichinosis thing. 
[00:27:30]  No.  All right, good.  There you go.  Drink away, guys.  I'm sure there's something else.  It just doesn't seem very healthy.  We really need to eat raw animal stuff.  We really need someone that knows what they're talking about.  Yeah.  Right?  Doug, what's going on?  When are you guys going to learn?  Don't say what you're going to do.  Just do it.  Well, we know, but we don't want to kill the girl.  Well, you're not going to kill her.  Go through her system.  What's the big deal?  Actually, to tell you the truth, though, if it doesn't matter, if we camouflage the studio,  they'll never know she died here. 
[00:28:00]  That's right.  I believe you're doing scenes from the New York Chainsaw Massacre.  Yeah, and then the only thing we have to worry about is getting a body out of the building without anyone noticing.  Oh, Beast, stop it.  We wrap her up in the tarp that was camouflaged in the studio and just leave it in the corner.  Drag her outside in the tarp into a dumpster, and that's it.  There you go.  O.D. is an expert on pig's blood.  How are you an expert, old dirty?  Hello.  Yes.  Yo, man, you didn't see Snatch?  I didn't see Snatch. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, yeah, Snatch.  Come on, man.  Bricktop explained everything, dude.  Yeah.  What is that, B?  Pigs will eat anything.  Pigs ate up a...  Yo, you didn't hear about the pig farmer?  I don't know if it was in the Midwest or something like that.  But, O.D.  What happened?  We're talking about the girl drinking the pig's blood.  I wouldn't recommend it, B.  Why not?  I don't know, man.  Pigs are dirty, dude.  After I saw Snatch, I swore off pork chops and bacon, kid.  All right, hold on.  Let me ask her another question.  We'll work this out. 
[00:29:00]  This is how we do things.  Maria.  Yeah.  Instead of drinking the pig's blood, can we get you naked and throw you in a dumpster?  Get me naked and throw me in a dumpster?  Well, like you wear the bra and panties and Rick will find a nice dumpster somewhere.  You jump in, you roll around a little bit, get all messy, and then you qualify for the  55-gallon jump challenge.  What happened to you guys boiling it?  You want...  Well...  If someone could tell us that she'll be safe if we boil it, I would love to see you  scooping up pig's blood on a spoon. 
[00:29:30]  I would assume that if you boil it, it would kill anything that would hurt her.  We don't have one real expert that listens to the Opie and Anthony show?  Then it ends up a food product.  Maria, how old a girl are you?  21.  She sounds like she's about 12, doesn't she?  21.  Well, you got a little voice.  21, you're extra healthy.  You'll be fine.  Yeah, you'll walk it off, pig.  All right, hold on a minute.  Let me go back to old Dirty.  O.D.  You're going to boil the blood?  Boil the blood and have her scoop and eat it.  Yo, what is this turning to cannibalism all of a sudden, B? 
[00:30:00]  You got three bitches going to drink blood tomorrow.  What's going on?  Hold on, hold on.  Come on.  One girl eating pig's blood and one girl getting squirted by blood through super soakers.  Yeah.  Well, we all agree that there's blood in the mix.  Can we agree on that?  Yeah.  All right, man.  What's up with you?  Oh, my God, yo.  Yo, did you?  Yo, my man.  I forgot to tell you.  What?  Did you see the glutton ball on Fox? 
[00:30:30]  Oh, yeah, the glutton ball.  That's Thursday.  We talked about that, Ralph.  We talked about it, too.  Talk about that?  Why didn't you call in?  I was out of state, my brother.  We weren't happy about the glutton ball because they didn't show the contestants puking.  I think puking is the whole bit.  Yo, dude.  Puking is always funny.  Yeah.  I don't care how disgusting it is, but it's disgusting, but it always makes you chuckle.  It's always fun.  Hello?  Yeah, go ahead.  Yo, let me tell you something, man.  We have failed as a society if that makes it on TV, dude. 
[00:31:00]  Why?  You know what I'm saying?  It's entertainment.  Yo, entertainment.  Picture taking that flick and showing it in Africa.  Them poor skinny people out there, they'll be shocked and amazed at the way these people  are eating that thing, man.  I was thinking that, too.  36 eggs.  I was like, oh, my God.  This is like a slap in the face.  It's like, we got so much, we can make a show out of it and just waste, you know, like  a ton of food feeding these fat pugs, you know?  Funny, man.  I hear you, dude.  We do it for our enjoyment.  Yeah, yeah.  No doubt. 
[00:31:30]  No doubt.  All right.  You can buy pasteurized pig's blood.  Where the hell would you get that?  Yo, man.  I'm telling you, man.  All right.  We're still waiting for that true expert to tell us if we could get away with this one.  Yo, but you didn't hear about the pig farmer that was feeding his pigs human body parts  or something like that?  Yeah, we heard that.  They eat anything.  Yeah, man.  Come on.  Picture what's in the blood, dude.  Hey, old Dirty.  What's up?  You have nothing today, so we're going to move on.  Peace.  We're trying.  We're sitting here.  Nothing's happening.  Nothing.  I hear you, man.  I hear you.  It's the reality of what you do and what we do. 
[00:32:00]  It doesn't mean you suck.  You're just not happening today.  You got nothing today.  You got nothing.  I got nada.  But next time you call, you'll smoke for us.  You know what I'm saying?  Oh, yeah.  No doubt.  All right.  Things happen.  All right.  Peace, baby.  We'll talk to you soon.  All right.  Oh, did you like the rest of the Olympics?  It sucked.  Look at me.  You're still trying as I reach for the hang-up.  You watched the closing ceremonies.  Oh, yes, I did.  And anything?  It sucked.  Sucked.  That's all I got. 
[00:32:30]  That's all you got.  Oh, man.  Nothing.  You have nothing.  Nothing.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Later, yo.  At least we're honest with each other, you know?  You know what I mean?  All right, kid.  Peace.  That's our job, though, to try to, you know, to just try to, I don't know, get something  going on.  Yeah.  Even when there's nothing.  Yeah, we tried it all dirty.  Sometimes he's a diamond in the rough.  Right.  That time, just rough.  Oh, cool, man.  We have some brand new Drew Boogie stuff. 
[00:33:00]  Drew Boogie in the studio.  Hello.  Drew Boogie helps us get a little rhythm on this radio show.  Yes, sir.  Because we suck.  Drew Boogie helping out the white boys with a little rhythm.  So we can get our listenership up, Anthony, because we know a lot of the people in the  hood listen to us.  The brothers are listening.  That's right.  So we try to impress them with some rhymes every once in a while.  And this is great stuff because he takes clips from the show.  So whether it's a phone call, in this case, what, Buddy Epson, you got some stuff from  Buddy Epson, or my mom singing one of her songs. 
[00:33:30]  Bring back your nightmares.  During the Super Bowl party.  And then he actually, what do you, you put these things on acetate?  No, actually, I got a nice little CD running.  Oh, look at you.  You're not kicking it old school no more.  No, no more acetate.  It's too expensive.  Yeah.  So I got this nice little CD unit and I got a computer program.  So now everything's much cleaner.  Wow.  Look at that.  And he mixes our stuff is what it comes down to, Anthony.  Yes.  Drew Boogie in the computer age now. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  Throws a little rhythm into what we do.  Yeah.  So he walked in with like five new things that he did.  I swear to God, we haven't even heard him.  No.  You just walked in, right?  I just walked in.  So we're going to like debut this together.  You trust me that much.  Oh, yeah.  You've never done this wrong in the past, my friend.  Yes.  All right.  So let's try it.  Let's try the first one out.  It's Mercedes Benz.  Okay.  This must be my mom singing Mercedes Benz.  It's mom singing when she was drunk one night and you put a little rhythm to it, right?  Yep.  All right. 
[00:34:30]  Let's check it out.  Drew Boogie.  Oh, Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz?  Oh, Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz?  Shoot it loud.  Shoot it loud.  Not on your goddamn video. 
[00:35:00]  Hey.  Oh, shut up.  Oh, this is just hiding.  Oh, stop it.  Shut your mouth.  What the hell is going on?  Is that supposed to be sexy?  Hey, hey, hey.  Hey, hey, hey.  Oh, Lord.  Oh, Lord.  Shut up, stupid. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, Lord.  God damn it.  That's funny.  Not on your goddamn video.  Oh, what a bitch.  Oh, my man.  Son of a bitch.  No.  Hey, that's pretty good.  Wow.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Nice.  That's the first one he did.  And the next one is Well Doggy.  Well Doggy.  Well Doggies.  The Well Doggies.  Yeah.  Oh, oh, oh.  We do have four different Well Doggies.  Yes, we do.  Our buddy, our pal, Buddy Epson. 
[00:36:00]  Yes, Drew Boogie?  It's just that they're mainly the same thing, except for there's two distinct different versions.  So, this one is the first one.  The happy ending.  Right?  What does he say?  I see number six.  That's why.  Oh, okay.  Yes.  All right.  So, let's check this out.  It's Drew Boogie and a remix of Well Doggy, Buddy Epson.  Buddy Epson!  Well Doggies to you.  Hey, Buddy.  Hey. 
[00:36:30]  Last time you were on our show, we were singing a dirty version of the Beverly Hillbillies theme.  A dirty version?  It was kind of saucy.  You ready?  Yeah.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Use it or lose it.  Well Doggies.  Well Doggies.  Oh, yeah.  Well Doggies.  Well Doggies.  Well Doggies.  Can I get a seat?  Yeah Doggies.  Oh Doggies.  Yeah Doggies.  Yeah Doggies.  Yeah Doggies.  Oh yeah.  Oh Doggies.  Oh Doggies.  Yeah.  Well Baby.  Hey. 
[00:37:00]  Well Doggies.  Oh Doggies.  Huh?  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  Oh.  Well Doggies.  Oh, I get you.  That's a little racy there, Buddy.  Huh?  Is that what you wanted?  Yes.  For something racy.  That's just racy.  You like it.  I like that.  Well thank you very much.  There you go.  Yeah.  Just a basic version.  Now what's the difference between that one and the other one that's on here?  Oh, you'll see.  Oh, let's go right to it then. 
[00:37:30]  Here it is.  Well Doggies again, right?  Yeah.  Buddy up, sir.  Well Doggies to you.  Hey Buddy.  Hey.  Last time you were on our show, you were singing a dirty version of the Beverly Hillbillies theme.  A dirty version?  It was kind of saucy.  You ready?  Yeah.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Use it or lose it.  Well Doggies.  Well Doggies.  Oh yeah.  Well Doggies.  Oh yeah.  Oh, Carter.  Well Doggies.  Oh, did I get a change?  Yeah, doggies.  Oh, Carter.  Yeah, doggies.  Oh yeah.  Yeah, doggies. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, doggies.  Oh yeah.  Oh, doggies.  Oh, doggies.  Yeah.  Well, baby.  Hey.  Uh.  Oh.  All right.  Hey.  Oh, women.  Oh, doggies.  Yeah.  Oh, doggies.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Buddy.  Come here.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  It's just me.  Oh, my God.  They're sick, man. 
[00:38:30]  Very nice.  You killed Buddy.  We got a couple more to play, but there's a cardiologist on the line here.  Frank, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  All right.  You going to help us?  Are you going to be the expert here or what?  Well, I don't know if I can be the expert, but I only have a second.  But to answer the question about trichinosis, there are no cases of trichinosis anymore.  Besides, trichinosis is a parasite that would be found in the flesh of the animal, not necessarily the butt.  Okay.  I would not personally advise anyone to drink animal blood of any kind. 
[00:39:00]  You know, chicken blood or beef blood, if it's not cooked, can carry some blood-borne pathogens.  Oh.  And there is the potential.  Whether or not you would develop those is not a guarantee.  You could drink as much blood as you could and walk away fine.  Other people, depending on their immune system or other factors, could develop some kind of parasitic condition.  Oh, my God.  So what do I have?  What do I? 
[00:39:30]  Oh, sorry.  All of a sudden, I felt like a doctor.  It was telling me bad news.  You know, I guess you'd boil it.  That probably would resolve the parasite issue.  But, hey, no guarantee.  All right.  But, you know, worth a shot.  All right, Frank.  I mean, I'll be listening to you what happens, so I'll know in the future what to say.  All right.  Thank you.  Okay.  Bye.  Yeah, nothing either.  Rich, what's up?  Hello.  Hey, go ahead, Rich.  Real fast.  Okay, yeah.  If you boil the blood, you'll be killing the bacteria. 
[00:40:00]  The bacteria dies around 160, 170 degrees.  If you boil it, you'll bring it up to around 212.  I've been a professional chef for 20 years.  Ask Frenchy about blood sausage.  Okay.  So as long as we boil the damn thing.  Absolutely.  All right.  We're in.  We'll be able to eat it like pudding.  There you go.  You guys ready?  All right.  Maria.  Yeah.  We'll see you tomorrow.  How are we getting the pig's blood?  Are you getting the pig's blood, Frenchy?  I got the lamb blood out there. 
[00:40:30]  You got lamb blood?  Yeah.  How much?  A whole gallon of lamb blood?  For today?  Yeah.  No, for tomorrow.  Oh, that's for tomorrow.  Bring the blood in.  I want to see that.  Let's take a look at it.  Maria, we got to figure out how to get the pig's blood for you, all right?  All right.  You can't bring it in, right?  Yeah, right.  Obviously not.  All right.  Hold on.  We'll talk to you.  It looks like we're in as long as we boil the blood in.  Yeah.  I say she would vomit.  All right.  I don't think she'd be able to.  That would look so cool, though.  Her puke and blood.  Oh. 
[00:41:00]  All right.  We got a couple more from Drew Boogie.  Well, we'll play one more, then we'll play a couple more after the break.  How's that?  Yes.  Oh, there's the blood.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Here, bring that over here.  Oh, God damn.  We're putting this in super soakers tomorrow?  Dude, look at that stuff.  Oh, my God.  That is bloody.  And we'll be able to...  Don't open it.  No.  Don't fill it.  Shut up.  You drop everything.  Dude, look at the blood.  Oh, it's just...  Stop it. 
[00:41:30]  It doesn't smell like anything.  No, I'm looking at the blood dripping off of the rim there.  It doesn't smell like anything.  I don't care.  No, as long as it's cold, it's fine.  Look, it's blood.  And we'll be able to squirt this out of a super soaker?  Yeah, you will.  Oh, yeah.  It's liquid.  Oh, nice.  How cool is that?  Ladies, we love it.  It's going to be cold.  Screw the rest of today's show.  I can't wait for tomorrow's show.  I know.  Isn't that great?  We have nothing for today compared to what we're going to do tomorrow.  Just put that back in the fridge.  All right, here you go.  Refrigerate.  Dude, there's blood all over you.  See?  I knew it. 
[00:42:00]  The container's all bloody French.  Let me see your hands.  Ah.  Dude, it looks like you had some of that prison sex.  Oh, man.  Give me a towel.  What?  Relax, Ben.  That's how Schillinger's junk looked after he got ready with that rapist kid.  Okay. 
[00:42:30]  Hold on.  All right, Drew Boogie, what's the next track we got here?  I think it's Whip Em Out.  Whip Em Out?  A new Whip Em Out chant?  Yeah.  All right, let's check this out from our buddy Drew Boogie giving us a little rhythm on the show, Ant.  It's Whip Em Out Wednesday!  Whip Em Out!  Whip Em Out!  Whip Em Out!  Whip Em Out!  Whip Em Out!  Whip Em Out!  Whip Em Out!  Whip Em Out!  Yeah!  Whip Em Out!  Whip Em Out!  Whip Em Out!  Whip Em Out!  Whip Em Out!  Whip Em Out!  Whip Em Out!  Whip Em Out! 
[00:43:00]  Whip Em Out!  Oh, my God.  B double O be boobs!  Boom!  There's a lovely young lady showing her breasts.  Boop.  Boop.  Boo.  They make you chuckle.  Girls all over the country flashing their lovely boobs.  I'm scared how many groups I tell you.  Can?  I don't have those.  You are particular.  Bownies. 
[00:43:30]  What's this?  Bownies.  Man.  That rocks, man.  That's great.  I love the Norton touch in there.  Very nice.  We've got a couple more to play.  At least two, maybe three more to play from Drew Boogie after the break.  Okay?  Anthony, one hour to go in the voting for the Naughty Nighty contest.  Last minute votes. 
[00:44:00]  Get them in.  Go to opianthony.com if you have not voted today.  We will announce the winners in the 5 o'clock hour today, shortly after 5.  The voting will stop at 5.  We've got to just do a quick tally.  And we'll have the top five winners on the show in the 5 o'clock hour today.  And we'll announce the grand prize winner for that trip to Hedonism 3, okay?  Who's it going to be?  And when we get back from break, we have Sarah coming in.  She's going to eat lamb brain right from the skull.  Right, Frenchie? 
[00:44:30]  Yes, that's it.  Can we bring that in real fast?  I want to see that real fast.  Take a look.  Frenchie.  He told me that he prepared the skull so that the girl could just scoop it right out.  Scoop it out of the skull.  We've got to check this out real fast before we take a break.  On the Opie Anthony and Frenchie show.  Look, it's in a big plastic bag.  All right.  Well, it's in another bag.  And then paper.  And he's got his knife with him. 
[00:45:00]  Let me see.  Here he goes, opening up, wrapped it up very nicely.  Hey, Frenchie, by the way, don't make fun of anyone today because that's what they're expecting.  Show another side of it today.  It looks like a roadkill in Texas.  Get a picture of that for the website.  What's that?  Wait, is that his tongue?  Yeah, that's the tongue.  The tongue is like just hanging out to the side of its mouth.  Frenchie, how's she going to get to the brain?  That skull looks intact. 
[00:45:30]  No, he's going to...  Go ahead, French.  I cut it open.  You will cut open the skull?  Is it already open?  No, no, no.  It's closed.  I'll do it later on in front of her.  Is there like skin still on the skull kind of?  Yeah.  It stinks.  Oh, God damn it.  It stinks.  Okay.  Back in the fridge.  Get it out of here.  Back in the fridge.  Why should we think it shouldn't smell anything like dead animal?  Frenchie, hold it up.  Look at you.  You get your picture on the website. 
[00:46:00]  Hello.  Hey, I'm Frenchie.  Oh, it's not the tarp.  Oh, yeah.  Where's the tarp?  Just in case a lot of lambs start calling up and wondering where their lost child is.  Why does it stink so bad?  Frenchie, why does it smell?  It smells like lamb.  It's boiled lamb.  It smells like dead animal.  That's it.  Because it's dead animal.  It's delicacy in Italy.  It used to eat the eyeballs in the soup.  Well, you know something?  I'm an American.  I know nothing about those stupid dagos eating the goddamn lamb head.  Anthony, when we get back, Sarah will be scooping out the brain directly from the lamb's skull. 
[00:46:30]  Well, she does this.  She will be our fourth contestant in the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Raunchy audio.  Look like a dog for me.  Spankable video.  I got my thing in my hand here.  All the best parts of the Opie and Anthony show end up on BoundaryMusic.com.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:47:00]  Lots to do today.  In about an hour, we'll announce the winner of the Naughty Nighty contest finally.  God, that thing stinks so bad.  If you can get a last-minute vote in for your favorite in the Naughty Nighty contest,  go to opianthony.com.  Hey, Frenchy.  Could you move the lamb head that way a little bit? 
[00:47:30]  Keep going.  Keep going.  There you go.  That's good.  All right.  Stinky cam's up so you can take a look at the lovely lamb head.  And Frenchy's going to prepare the skull.  Sarah's outside the studio, and she seems a bit nervous there today.  It looks like a dinosaur skull, doesn't it?  Yeah. 
[00:48:00]  Or a collie skull.  Collie skull?  Yeah.  Oh, look at Frenchy go.  Don't hurt yourself there, Frenchy.  Wait, wait, wait.  Get it on mic.  I want to hear you cutting into the skull.  Yeah, put that there.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  There you go.  Listen to this.  He's just hammering the knife into the skull.  Frenchy, do you know what you're doing?  Yes.  Are you sure? 
[00:48:30]  Yes.  See, they only pick up weapons against animals that are already dead.  Oh, my God.  Just sprayed out all over Steve, it looked like.  You realize this thing's really going to stink once he opens it up.  Oh, God.  He's cracking big holes in the skull.  Listen to gushy it sounds.  You hear the gush?  A little hammer. 
[00:49:00]  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  Oh, my God.  How much does she have to eat?  I don't know.  Enough, I guess.  Open the rest up.  Let's hear.  I don't know what the sounds are. 
[00:49:30]  He just broke the knife.  It's like.  All right.  All right.  We get the point.  Thank you, Frenchy.  Before we invite Sarah in to do this, to try to qualify for the 55-gallon drum challenge,  we have one more remix from Drew Boogie who stopped by with a bunch of remixes for us.  Yes, sir.  One more we want to play here.  Because the other one's a theme song for Sucks to Be You.  Yeah.  One of our segments that we do every once in a while. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, save that.  But here's Drew Boogie adding a little rhythm to our show with a little piece he calls Ear  Splitter.  Ear Splitter.  Listen to it very loud.  Very loud.  Turn up your radio.  It's Drew Boogie.  Are you ready?  Here they come.  Opie and Anthony.  How you guys doing?  Get down.  Yeah.  Oh!  Shut up.  Shut up.  More weed every day.  Oh! 
[00:50:30]  Smoke weed every day.  Would you shut the f**k up?  What?  That's how I do it.  No, no, no, you imbecile.  No.  Wow, I thought you were a girl.  You're an ass.  What the hell were you thinking?  Are you going to do it?  You stink.  Are you going to do it?  We suck.  Are you going to do it?  Shut up, stupid.  Stop, stop, stop, stop, die. 
[00:51:00]  Don't shoot dogs, you carry the mail.  Do wind and thunder, snow and hay.  Had no dogs, they had no slant.  But what the drove them straight ahead?  Go, man, go.  He's mushed in his food bowl.  So go, man, go, man, go, man, go.  I say, Oopie, what did you learn?  There you go.  Very nice.  Drill boogie.  Thank you much.  Helping out the show.  We appreciate it.  As Frenchy prepares the skull over there in the corner. 
[00:51:30]  The lamb skull.  You can get a peek at it on the Stinky Cam.  Keep the mic over there a little bit so we can just hear.  All right.  Chris, what's going on?  Yo, guys, that was the sickest thing I've ever heard.  Aw.  What, the knife going into the skull?  Yeah, it sounded like Norton on a first date.  Aw.  It is so hard to watch.  Yeah, you don't have better tools than this?  No, I just got these.  No, the French do it this way.  I think we need, like, pliers or something so we can kind of pry open the, uh, just watch 
[00:52:00]  it don't slip into your hand.  Yeah, I know, I know.  That seems to be a very unsafe way.  There you go, Anger.  All right.  Sorry.  All right, I'm getting nauseous.  God, it's all...  It's all gooey.  It's all, like, gook pouring out of the skull.  All right, Ant, uh, 55-gallon drum challenge.  Well, I think we're going to try to do it a week from, uh, Friday.  Yeah.  I believe.  Mm-hmm.  We need to get, uh, four more contestants, right? 
[00:52:30]  How, um, how many we got so far?  Uh, three.  This will make three?  Uh, this will make four if she...  Oh, four.  If she does it today.  All right.  Matter of fact, I got the audio of some of the girls qualifying really fast.  Oh, there it goes, right?  Is that the skull just popping off, the rest of it?  Almost, yeah.  No, it was just the spoon.  It hit the plate.  How big is the hole from the back of the head?  It's enough to put the spoon in.  Oh, look, look.  There you go.  Oh, man. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, no.  The whole top of his little lamby head is gone.  Oh, no, he's hitting it with a hammer.  I got it now.  That's the one.  All right.  Frenchie's...  Frenchie's always talking about that.  Now, let's see with that little cap removed.  Oh.  Ah!  Damn!  All right, Ant.  Oh, that was wrong, man.  So, let's review to show the people how we got to today. 
[00:53:30]  All right?  Oh, dude, he's putting the spoon in.  Look, look, look at the spoon's in.  Dinner is served.  Bon appétit.  Leave it right there.  Make sure it's facing the stinky cam so they can see the spoon and all that.  All right, Anthony.  So, I forget all the girls' names.  I think the first girl to qualify was the one from Brockton, right?  Yeah.  Becky from Brockton, I believe, right?  Becky from Brockton.  This is what Becky from Brockton did.  She ate lamb eyes.  Yeah.  She ate two of them.  Chocolate covered, by the way.  So, she had to bite into these big chocolate messes, and there was this tough, chewy lamb eyeball inside. 
[00:54:00]  And this is Becky qualifying for the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Here we go.  Suck it!  Oh, God.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Oh, God, I can't take this.  Let me see.  Let's see half.  Chew, chew, chew.  Chew, chew, chew.  Oh, God damn it.  This is disgusting.  It's not bad.  You have to eat the other half of the little fella's eye.  How did that taste? 
[00:54:30]  It's like black inside.  How did that taste?  How did that taste?  Oh, DJ.  It doesn't really taste like anything.  It's just like super, super chewing.  Yeah.  It's not going to hurt you.  Eat the other half.  There you go.  Hey.  Oh, you hear a crackling?  God, do you hear it?  It's making that gushy sound.  She's doing good.  She'll finish it.  Oh, she's chewing.  She's chewing.  Oh, she's gagging.  Uh-oh, she's gagging a little bit.  Swallow that fatty eye.  That ligament and cartilage off the little lamb's head.  Oh, that is just lamb fat. 
[00:55:00]  Gouged out with a big knife and...  All right, that piece is a little rougher, huh?  She's a really cool chick.  She's a really cool chick.  So that's how Becky qualified for the 55 Grand Drum Challenge.  Next up was her friend Stephanie from Taunton.  What?  Taunton.  I'm so disgusted.  I can't even look over in that direction.  I popped the stinky cam up to look now, so I don't have to look directly at it.  With the spoon hanging out of the side of its head. 
[00:55:30]  Does it make it better that it's on the computer?  Yeah, it does.  I can't look at it in real life.  All right.  So here's Stephanie.  She decided on a whim to stick her head in a toilet bowl and blow bubbles, Anthony.  Uh-huh.  But there was a little surprise.  Yeah.  That we didn't tell her about.  A little tidbit in the bowl.  Here's Stephanie qualifying for the 55 Gallon Drum Challenge.  Hey, there's something you don't see in a toilet every day.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:56:00]  All right, Rick.  Is she ready?  Yeah, she's ready.  She's staring face first into the bowl.  Are we taking video of this?  Yeah.  Stinky's running video, and she knows she's got to do it for five seconds and blow bubbles.  I want to hear gurgling.  Get the mic right there.  All right.  Here we go.  One, two, three.  That's definitely five seconds. 
[00:56:30]  What the f*** is that?  No.  That was gross.  Thank you.  Don't curse.  What?  What's wrong?  What was that?  Stephanie, why are you cursing?  She said, what the f*** is that?  I'm sorry, I threw poop in there.  There's a nugget.  Someone popped a nugget.  Man, these girls are troopers.  They really want to be in the 55 Gallon Drum Challenge.  Yes.  Can we tell everyone that first prize in the 55 Gallon Drum Challenge will walk away with $2,000? 
[00:57:00]  Two grand.  $2,000.  There you go, ladies.  And finally, Anthony, this was from yesterday.  Double LC from Cleveland.  She was the girl that got on a bus at midnight to make it to the radio show.  Yeah.  She was on Greyhound.  She fell asleep because she started her trip at midnight.  Yeah.  She woke up because she was being fondled by an Arab gentleman.  Another gentleman, an Arab, was fondling her. 
[00:57:30]  She got to the studio and she performed the headstand discipline thing.  Yes.  She did a headstand and pretty much just unleashed on herself.  And this is how it sounded yesterday.  To qualify for the 55 Gallon Drum Challenge.  Yeah.  Only show people.  Everything's good.  Just relax.  All right.  Concentrate.  All right.  She's thinking.  She's thinking.  She's thinking.  There you go.  Just concentrate.  Concentrate. 
[00:58:00]  All right.  All right.  There we go.  Go ahead, Norton.  Hold her up.  Hold her up.  Hold her up.  She broke her neck.  There we go.  Okay.  Let her rip.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  Keep it moving.  Keep it moving.  All right.  Hold her up.  Hold her up.  Lift up.  All right.  Don't explain what happened.  All right.  Wow.  Yeah.  Okay.  A little bit.  All right.  Hold on.  All right.  There you go.  Just finish up however you want. 
[00:58:30]  All right.  Well.  Wow.  How do we explain that one to the kids?  That was great.  It was interesting.  Yeah.  It was fun to watch.  Norton really enjoyed it.  Yeah.  It ended up everywhere on her.  Yeah.  It's great.  Yeah.  So there you go.  There are the three girls that have qualified so far for the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Today, we have the lamb brain girl.  So let's get Sarah in the studio here, okay?  Yeah.  Bring Sarah in.  And tomorrow, we're going to get a bunch of lamb blood. 
[00:59:00]  Well, we already had the blood.  We got a gallon of it.  We're going to fill up super soakers and shoot a girl until she's just covered in blood.  Right.  She'll be in her bra and panties.  Hey, how are you?  Hi.  Look at you.  You're a real small little thing, aren't you?  How old were you?  18.  18.  And where are you from?  Cleveland.  You drove from Cleveland, too?  No, I didn't drive.  My friend drove.  God, Cleveland loves this damn radio show.  Look at the support they give us, Ant.  Driving all night to get here.  What time did you guys leave?  This morning?  Yeah, about 5 in the morning. 
[00:59:30]  5 in the morning.  And how long did it take you?  Oh, about 8 hours.  7 hours.  7 hours.  Say, not bad.  Greyhound, 11 hours.  Get a guy to drive you.  7 hours.  7 hours.  Did you ever wake up with his hand in your lap?  No.  No?  No.  Not once.  One of the perks of Greyhound, I guess.  Right.  You don't get what to drive with your friend.  And Sarah, how old are you?  18.  18.  She's cute, too, Ant.  There you go.  Our first team.  Yes.  Our first team.  That could be in this 55-gallon drum challenge.  You seem really nervous. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah, I am.  Why are you nervous?  I don't know.  I just don't know.  Look at how nervous she is.  Let's just stare at her until she freaks out.  She's going to be a perfect contestant in the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Yeah, I think you're going to be petrified.  I think you're going to be freaked out being in the drum.  Have you ever eaten anything like that?  No.  Have you ever seen anything like that?  No.  Look at it.  Are you having second doubts right now?  No, I'm going to do it.  You're going to do it, huh? 
[01:00:30]  Look at the back side of it there, where the brains are.  All right.  What do you do in Cleveland?  This is what you do.  This is the get-to-know-you portion of the radio bit.  I don't work right now.  Well, you go to school?  What do you do?  I just stay home right now.  You just stay home?  Stay home.  You just hang out?  Yeah.  What do you want to do?  I'm taking a year off school.  Do you want to do anything, or do you want to just stay home?  I'm going back to school.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Spoke a lot of school.  No.  What school?  Huh?  What school?  High school?  Yeah.  Oh, my God. 
[01:01:00]  You're taking a year off of high school?  Yeah.  Why is that?  What happened?  You screwed up, didn't you?  Yeah.  What did you do?  I did that, too.  I got to the point where I screwed up so bad in school, it was best for me to just punch  out Maverick, just eject from the school, and start again the next year fresh.  You went to surfer school in California, didn't you?  In California, they sent me to what was called continuation school, or con school, as we called  it, and it was for the people that didn't like showing up to the nice school, which was  Dana Hills High School in Dana Point, California, and, oh, we can't have your type of people 
[01:01:30]  that cut class and go out and smoke drugs.  So, look, instead of, you know, maybe trying to have you fit into this school, we'd just  banish you to the stoner school, which I didn't mind at all.  Like, the teachers would leave to go surfing at noon, and everyone would just go out and  smoke pot.  You did about five dittos a day.  You'd get a ditto at your work, and it was the easiest stuff, and you'd hand it in and  get a grade.  And that was like one whole high school grade I went through like that.  And, but I screwed up so bad at John Glenn. 
[01:02:00]  I went to John Glenn out there in Elwood, and I had to take the whole year off.  I was so bad.  The guy, Pete Polina, he says to me, there's no chance you're going to graduate this year.  You've done nothing the whole year.  But what did you do?  You just started cutting a lot?  Yeah.  The thing is, a lot of the people I hung out with also cut, but they cut one class a  day.  I noticed I was hanging out with everybody all day long.  So I'm like, how come everyone else, like, is doing well?  Well, you notice it was like Joe Curry I was hanging with there at the second period, and 
[01:02:30]  then maybe Pete Googler I'd hang out with in the fourth period, and then John Inzalaco  I'd hang out with in the fifth period.  So they're all going to the rest of the classes.  I'm with everyone all day long, just smoking pot.  Where would you guys hang?  At school?  Yeah, at school.  We'd hang out.  You would hang at school, but not go to the classes.  How ridiculous is that?  When we cut at Harvard Field High, we would leave campus.  No.  I would leave sometimes, but only right down the road.  I had a friend, Frank Bush.  He went to the same school, and we'd go over to his house and watch cartoons. 
[01:03:00]  That's what we would do.  But again, he would go home for lunch.  We'd watch cartoons, smoke more pot, and he'd go, hey, I've got to get back to school.  And I'd be like, all right, Frank, I'll be here.  It's his house, you know?  Right.  I'm like, I ain't going.  F it.  So I'd just sit and watch the rest of the cartoons.  Or we'd just go out back by the gym and smoke pot.  When you were cutting at school, where would you hang?  Behind the gym.  Like right in the gym doors.  The whole day.  Then you'd walk around, and then you'd go to the cafeteria, you'd get something to eat. 
[01:03:30]  And then you'd walk back out.  Well, everyone else was educating themselves.  You would hang out at school.  But not go to classes.  But not go to classes.  Absolutely.  And you would walk into school to get some food, because you were hungry.  But you've got to eat.  I've got to eat.  So, yeah, I'd go in.  And I, you know, I was so stupid.  Oh, you're telling me something I didn't realize as I was knocking tin on rooftops going,  why did I go to school?  Why my mommy was right?  Why do I have this better job? 
[01:04:00]  I understand the whole cutting thing.  We all do it.  But to cut and actually stay at school day after day.  I cut for no reason.  I cut because I didn't want to.  And then it got to the point.  See, when we cut, we'd go to Manhattan for the day.  We'd hit the beach for the day.  It's like work.  I didn't want to go to school because it was like work.  To actually get the motivation up to stop smoking pot and go somewhere?  Stop it.  But you guys are talking like a crazy man.  You can smoke pot on the Long Island Railroad.  You can smoke pot at the beach. 
[01:04:30]  I would go to the school.  I would check in a homeroom.  And then leave.  And then we'd get to the point where...  Look at your sole responsibility.  You know, I didn't want to be marked completely absent.  Because then the letters get sent home and then...  So you're in Holmack and then they check you in.  Yeah.  And then what's your first move?  My first move is to cop a joint off of somebody.  And I'd buy a...  Who was careful back then?  You know, a couple of the guys. 
[01:05:00]  I don't remember any specifics as far as names went.  But, you know, we'd buy some joints and smoke pot outside the gym door.  Outside the gym doors in the back.  And then occasionally if like there was a class where a bunch of my friends were in or one class,  I might go to that one.  But then I'd get to the point where like I was in social studies and I hadn't been there for so long.  It's ridiculous that I'd just pop in.  Hi, remember me and sit down.  Right.  You reach a point of no return where there is no going back and getting into your classes.  Pete Polini or whatever his name is. 
[01:05:30]  Pete Polina.  Pete Polina.  He called me in and said, what are you doing?  You're wasting your time.  Now, did the teachers see you just kind of walking around getting food and stuff?  Sometimes, like if I saw...  Miss Gasser was the social studies teacher.  If I saw her walking down the hall, I'd do that.  Whoop!  Big about face and run around the corner.  Right.  And she saw me and stuff.  But, you know, oh, I think I got away with it.  I had time.  She didn't see me.  Yeah, I would do that.  I would just dodge the teachers.  I would go out back by the gym doors.  Would you use any of the other facilities while you were there?  Well, the bathrooms.  I had to use the bathroom. 
[01:06:00]  The bathrooms, sure.  And the cafeteria.  The cafeteria to get the food.  Great strad and all that.  Sometimes I would use the wood shop to make a pipe if no one had joints and I just had like a nickel bag.  I'd just get a piece of wood, grab a nice half-inch wood bit, drill that in, and then I'd grab the quarter-inch bit, drill it the other way to make the mouthpiece, and I'm smoking my weed out of a two-by-four.  Thank you, shop class.  You sound like Spicoli.  I pretty much, yeah, it was pretty close to that.  Believe me, I did nothing.  And then I went back the next year, and I really applied myself, and that was the best week in high school I ever had because I went right back to doing the same thing. 
[01:06:30]  And I just ended up leaving school and going into the lucrative career of dishwashing and then tin-knocking until my lottery ticket came in on the OP show back in the...  At any point did you think to yourself, wow, this is not good?  Yeah, but I couldn't...  Did you try to turn it around?  I was trying to turn this thing around. 
[01:07:00]  Where's your toolbar?  Because most people will cut to the point where they realize they better stop and just do the basics and get through school.  You are absolutely right, and when that thought entered my head, I squashed it with pot.  You would smoke more pot, and the best thing about pot was it would make you think, I'll do it tomorrow.  Like, I'm going to apply myself tomorrow.  And before I knew it, tomorrow I was 28 years old, and I'm knocking 10 on a roof going, I can't go back to high school now. 
[01:07:30]  28.  You know?  I'm done.  I screwed up, and there's no turning back.  Good enough diploma.  I'm getting a GED.  Good enough diploma.  I'm going to go to college.  Slow down.  Slow down.  Why are you dodging teachers?  They wouldn't have recognized you anyway.  No, they're not.  There's your foot.  What's up?  Hey, what's up, man?  Anthony, tell them about Anthony Kimi, a professional gym student.  Yeah, then here was that last year after they let me back in, after I screwed up. 
[01:08:00]  I had to make up gym credits.  How old were you when you were giving it that last shot?  Oh, yeah.  I was 32 years old.  No, I believe I was 19.  I was 19 in high school.  No offense, dude.  Dude, me.  Everybody shows their face at 19 at a high school.  I wanted to try.  I had a problem.  I gave it a shot.  I gave it one last shot.  I understand.  How are you doing?  Yeah.  But age was so different back then. 
[01:08:30]  When you saw like a 19-year-old hanging around the campus, you're like, what's the old man doing?  I'd have the teachers yelling at me to go home.  I'm like, no, I go here.  Now you're down.  Stop it.  You're selling drugs to the kids.  Yeah.  Remember when I had my beard, my long hair, I looked like I was 42 years old?  Yeah, this guy, Joe Curry, man, he could grow a full like lumberjack style beard.  I think there were even some grays in it at the time.  Yeah.  And he'd be walking down the hall going to class and he'd have teachers going, get out of here.  Yeah.  Okay.  I'd flip one day.  I'm like, fine, see you later. 
[01:09:00]  So professional gym student?  Yeah, so I got to the point where I needed so many gym credits to make up.  Usually you went to gym every other day.  That was it.  You had your gym class, maybe fifth period every other day.  And gym credits looked like the deficit clock.  Yeah, it was the deficit clock.  I had to make up gym.  So I had two classes every other day and one class every day.  So it was like I was going to gym sometimes twice a day, but I was going at least once a day. 
[01:09:30]  Just to make up for it.  Jim is the biggest joke to him.  And Jim Friggin Cirillo was the gym teacher.  No different than any other gym teacher.  It was just a prick on wheels.  And I had to deal with that on a daily basis.  Tell me, where's your uniform?  Uniform?  What?  It's gym class in a school, you dick.  It's not a uniform.  Oh, let me get my dress shorts on.  It must be, you know, the officers are coming to inspect the gym class.  So what would you have to do in a gym twice a day? 
[01:10:00]  I did nothing.  I played badminton.  Sometimes I got in my shorts.  I would make sure he took attendance.  I would go out back doors and smoke pot with my friends.  Yeah.  I smoked more pot in high school.  It was ridiculous.  I would wake and bake.  And I would wake up late.  Like I said, I went to a homeroom.  That's if I ever got there on time.  Yeah.  I would wake up.  And my mother would think I was gone already.  But I couldn't sneak past her.  I had to jump off the second story porch out the back door.  Because I had woken up and smoked pot and went back to sleep. 
[01:10:30]  So then I'd walk to school.  I'd get there about, I don't know, 11.  And continue smoking pot with my friends and make them believe I was going to school.  Did your mom try to turn this thing around?  No.  She gave up.  She had given up.  She gave up.  What's cause?  She gave the old college try at raising three kids by herself for a while.  And she did a great job.  But once we reached an age where we were supposed to let our own responsibilities take over,  it was like she just said, look, you're wrong.  You're wrong.  What am I going to do?  You know, put you up and everything for responsibility. 
[01:11:00]  It's yours.  Take it.  Embrace it.  Run with it.  Have fun.  Give it a try.  How about the time I almost got you busted?  We were smoking cigarettes.  And you go, watch that nobody comes.  Right, boy?  I go, watch that.  Joe, get by the bathroom door and make sure no one comes in.  I take a hit of this thing.  And there's a teacher standing there.  And Joe going, I thought he couldn't talk.  Yeah, I got tongue-tied.  That's all right.  It's not like I was getting in any more or less trouble.  I was always at the peak of trouble.  That's classic.  Yeah, it was a lot of fun.  All right, Foote. 
[01:11:30]  All right, boys.  Got to run.  See you later.  All right.  Bye-bye.  And Foote's one of the guys I used to hang with and do this stuff with, but it was for  one period a day, the one period he had off.  Right.  And there was all the other friends.  And I was thinking, how come they're all graduating and I'm not?  And then it hit me.  Oh, my God.  I was hanging out with a different person every period.  So what's your excuse?  Yeah.  Back to Sarah, who's in about me, douchebag.  Now, why are you taking the rest of the year off?  What did you do?  Because I turned 18 and I figured out what the hell. 
[01:12:00]  You figured what the hell you'd drop out.  Now, something tells me you don't look at your last report card and go, ah, the A's  are going to hold me.  I could just not go.  You're probably doing poorly, right?  You were doing B's and C's and you leave.  There's a subplot here you're not telling us.  Yeah, what's the real story there, Sarah?  That's the real story, yeah.  So are you going to go back next year?  Yeah.  Older friends?  What do you have friends that aren't in school?  Yeah, I'm bringing your guy in here. 
[01:12:30]  Is this a boyfriend or just a friend?  He'll tell us the truth.  Frenchie, move over.  It's not about you today.  Jesus.  Ah, suck it.  What's he saying to you, Opie?  Suck it!  Oh, my God, Frenchie, you better watch it.  Frenchie's not going to make fun of you.  You dumb, Opie.  Nope, don't say that about Opie.  You stupid faggot.  Stop it, Frenchie.  Frenchie's not going to make fun of anyone today, Anthony, because that's what they're expecting.  Right, we don't want to burn you out.  We don't want to burn you out.  We want to show another side of you today.  What's your name?  Hiroshima.  Steve, you brought Sarah down from Cleveland, right? 
[01:13:00]  Yes.  Do you want to do her?  No.  Of course he does.  You're such a liar.  How do you know each other?  Don't even lie.  Unless you're brother and sister, I do not believe you.  No.  How do you know him?  I'm friends with her boyfriend.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Oh, boy.  This is bad.  So why didn't a boyfriend drive Sarah down to New York?  First time in New York, Sarah?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Why isn't the boyfriend here?  He doesn't go to school today.  He's not in school today.  It all comes around, don't it? 
[01:13:30]  It's true.  So he's going to school.  And said, dude, take care of my girlfriend in New York, right?  I don't understand this.  Your boyfriend is still in school, but you chose to leave school.  Yeah.  And hang out with guys that aren't your boyfriend.  Well, I mean, he's just my friend.  No, no crimes taking her across state lines, are there?  Sarah, I got what he's got.  What, a schlong?  Yeah, and he definitely wants to do it.  Take care of me.  Yeah, it happens.  It's just this on the show.  It's natural.  It's nothing to be embarrassed about or anything. 
[01:14:00]  Now, even though your friend's going out with Sarah, can you at least admit that she's  attractive and you would love to have her if the dance came about?  Oh, yeah.  She's very hot.  All right.  There you go.  There you go.  See?  You guys talk and like you tell each other little shit.  All right.  So, why isn't Sarah in high school anymore?  What'd you do?  Pretty much the same reason as Aunt.  She discovered the magic herb.  Oh, gee, you smoke a little weed.  What happens?  It's okay.  Mom, we're just kidding if you're listening.  Hey, you know something? 
[01:14:30]  Any kid that's out there smoking pot and thinking of leaving school, just look at what happened  to me and really apply your...  Oh, wait a minute.  That's right.  I have a great career in radio.  What happened?  Oops, that example doesn't work.  No, but you know what happens?  Eventually, you'll stop smoking the weed.  And the parents are cool with you?  It's a stepping stone.  You move on to Coke and morphine.  And the E and...  Whatever else comes across.  Are your parents cool with you just taking a year off?  They don't care.  They don't care and they're not telling you to get a job or anything? 
[01:15:00]  Just hang out in the house and have fun for a year?  It's my sister.  Your mom doesn't care.  They don't care?  Mm-mm.  Didn't say anything?  You just said, screw it.  And you just stay at home?  Is that what you do?  Well, I mean, I'm a guy.  I go out.  You go out?  I have a job.  I just quit.  I just quit it.  What was your job?  I'm a giant eagle.  Work in the solar department.  You were a giant eagle?  Yeah.  It's a grocery store.  Oh, okay.  Thank you.  Local reference, giant eagle. 
[01:15:30]  What did you do at the giant eagle?  Cashier?  No, I was in the solar department.  Oh, so you just kind of...  A lucrative career.  There you go.  Okay.  At the golden eagle, the flying what?  Were you the assistant to the assistant manager?  Hey, Rhett.  Your assistant to the assistant manager at a movie theater.  All right.  Did you get that shirt out of the hamper?  I think there's more to the story, but she's not...  She's not dodging us a little bit on this one, but that's cool.  It got me...  You made me reminisce about stuff that I just blacked out from over the years. 
[01:16:00]  A lot of fun.  There you go.  All right.  Are you psyched about being in the 55-gallon drum challenge if you could eat those lamb brains?  How much does you have to eat?  Yeah.  Oh, look at the face she's making.  I know.  She's so cute and stuff.  Yeah.  She's like, don't make me do too much.  How much do I have to eat?  Two.  Two?  Yeah.  You know why?  One is like, oh my God, I have to do one, but I did it and I swallowing and I got over it.  The anticipation of having to do a second one after you know how bad the first one is is kind of... 
[01:16:30]  Frenchy, what could you say lamb brains most resembles in a conventional food?  Dog crap?  No.  No, like cat food, like, you know...  Like cat food, kind of mushy.  And flavor-wise, is it like beef?  Is it like chicken?  It's lamb, but it doesn't really taste like anything.  It really doesn't taste like anything.  It doesn't taste like anything.  All right.  Look at the face she's looking.  So once you can put it out of your head that you're spooning big hunks of lamb brain in your mouth, it's nothing. 
[01:17:00]  Nothing.  She's making that face like, is this going to hurt?  I know.  She truly looks like, you know, the last time I saw that look, it was, hey, this isn't the way to my house.  You know?  All right.  Well, we're going to take a break.  When we get back, Sarah from Cleveland, who blew off school and drove all the way to New York with not her boyfriend.  Yeah.  We'll be attempting to qualify for the 55-gallon drum challenge, Anthony.  I think she's going to do it.  And less than a half hour left in the voting for the Naughty Nighty contest. 
[01:17:30]  You can do some last-minute voting at opiananthony.com.  We will have, hopefully, the top five girls on the radio in the 5 o'clock hour.  And we will announce the grand prize winner of that trip to Hedonism 3.  Roy!  All on the way on the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Naked Toucher.  Coming soon, the return of the 55-gallon drum challenge on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:18:00]  N-E-W.  Yeah, we're back.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Full house once again today.  Frenchie in the studio.  Oui.  Oui.  Jumbo game.  Also, Jamaican Mike making an appearance.  Jamaica Mike.  Big up.  Big up, Jamaica Mike.  Big up.  So you're doing a little commercial spot there for the gym.  Yeah, you see that?  I heard that.  I'm moving on up, man.  Hi, this is Jamaica Mike. 
[01:18:30]  Thanks, of course.  That's pretty good.  Yeah, but I've got to say thanks to you guys, you know?  It's been a while, yeah.  Yeah, it's been a while, yeah.  You know what?  I feel so privileged.  Mike runs the parking garage downstairs in the building that we're in here in New York.  And I use it every day.  I come wheeling in.  And some days they're very busy down there.  And it takes a while for one of the attendants downstairs to punch up my ticket to hand me the little slip.  And, you know, then they put the other part in your windshield wiper. 
[01:19:00]  And when you go to get your car, you give them the little piece of slip that they gave you when you came in.  So, sometimes you're standing around for a while.  Mike goes, let me show you how it's done.  You hit the monthly.  Now you hit this and the number and enter.  So, now I come wheeling up.  Peep, peep, peep, peep.  I do my own ticket, Opie.  People get so pissed sometimes, like some guy will be standing there a while.  And I'll just come air wheeling up.  Peep, peep, peep, peep, peep, peep, peep, peep, peep, peep, peep.  I put it under my own windshield wiper. 
[01:19:30]  I'm out.  Mike rules.  You see that?  I got to look out for you guys, man.  Because you guys always be good.  You're such a botty boy.  I'm not.  Interestingly enough, after my high school career, I realized that if I didn't get into radio, I'd be doing that job all the time.  Peep, peep, peep, peep, peep.  Yeah, so, Mike, why didn't you graduate high school?  What do you think of the lamb skull next to you there, Mike? 
[01:20:00]  I don't know, man.  This look all gross, you know.  They don't eat that down in Jamaica?  Yeah, but you know what happened?  What?  We roast it.  Like, you know, you get the heat up and you're putting it under fire.  Who has time to roast?  Yeah, but we got a radio show to do.  That cooking stuff is so overrated, right?  Put some jerk on it.  It'll be all right.  Put a little jerk on it.  That's right.  Yeah, a little jerk sauce and you're ready to go, you know.  Put it in a crock pot.  Let's open up a red stripe.  Yeah, a red stripe or a guineas that you're ready to go, man. 
[01:20:30]  Well, Jamaican Mike is now a star, Anthony.  Oh, let's hear the...  I got his testimonial.  It's for a gym in the New York area.  A gold's gym in New York area.  They're pretty much everywhere at this point.  And Jamaican Mike has a little thing.  Wow, look at you.  Let's hear.  Garden City Farm.  You can find him at goldsgym.com.  Hi, Jamaican Mike.  Thanks to Gold's Gym, I can hammer a nail with my bicep.  One week.  Three.  Yeah.  I can hammer a nail with my bicep. 
[01:21:00]  Who are you?  I ain't calling you, lady.  I'm asking.  Yep.  I'm asking.  Somebody was commenting that now that's your second appendage you can hammer a nail with.  Being Jamaican and all.  All right.  But that was good, though, man.  Yeah.  You know, it was great.  Well, did you meet Sarah from Cleveland?  No.  Sarah?  How are you?  She's real nervous.  Yeah.  She's all nervous.  She's going to be perfect for the 55-gallon drum challenge. 
[01:21:30]  You'll be okay pretty soon, Sarah.  You're going to be perfect.  Speaking of which, Greg has a question.  Greg, what's up?  Hello?  You're on the radio.  Hello.  Let's go, Greg.  Hello?  Hello.  Hey, Greg, go.  Oh, I was wondering what the 55-gallon drum challenge was.  What?  Yeah.  Where have you been?  I've been listening for like a week and a half, and I haven't heard anything.  Well, the 55-gallon drum.  You're calling from New York, too, right?  Yeah.  You just started listening to us?  What are you, insane?  No, I've been listening to you for about like six months now, and I just came back, 
[01:22:00]  and I was just listening for like a week, and you've been talking about it and getting  all these contestants, and I don't know what it is.  Basically, we get a bunch of contestants.  We get 55-gallon drums.  We put the girls in these drums in their bra and panties, and then we proceed to put things  in the barrel.  We don't want to give too much away.  Yeah, understandable.  Well, we put things in the barrel, and we see how much they can take.  All right.  And the girl that can take the most, she's going to walk away with $2,000. 
[01:22:30]  And girls are coming out of the woodwork to be part of this contest now, by the way.  All right?  Is New York actually being represented?  Uh, tomorrow we got, um, a couple girls from New York coming down to qualify.  Yes.  All right, good.  All right, Greg.  Thank you.  All right.  You guys suck.  Norton rules.  All right.  Uh, Liz has a problem.  Uh, Liz, what's going on?  Liz?  Oh, man, that would have been great.  Damn, what was it?  Liz, uh, called, uh, this number.  Because she found it on her husband's cell phone bill. 
[01:23:00]  Oh, damn, I love that gag.  So she's checking up on her husband.  You know, we've had a call like that before.  Here's a number I don't recognize.  I better call it.  We had a call like that from a mother who called because, uh, her son was using the phone.  Right.  And she called us and said, and, uh, didn't know it was a radio station.  And she was asking, what is this, uh, number?  Because, um, my, uh, we have a lot of calls that said, do you have a young son, uh, that  uses the phone?  She said, yes.  And then we went into a whole thing about how it's a gay male sex, uh, like meeting place. 
[01:23:30]  And now maybe you should sit him down and talk to him about his gay sex tendencies.  Ding dong.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Anyone else in here?  Look, man, we'll explain why we know this one.  Ding dong.  Ding dong.  Hello.  Hi.  Hi.  Are you, you're in here too?  Yeah.  Who else is in here?  Ding dong.  There's someone else.  Hello.  Hey.  Hi. 
[01:24:00]  Who are you?  Where are you from?  I'm from Jersey.  You want to get together?  You're close enough?  No, it's more like, I'm from Worcester.  Where are you from?  Hi.  Ding dong.  Hi.  Oh, we got someone else in here.  Boy, it's a regular little crowd starting up here.  So what are you guys into?  I like sucking C.  That was how this thing was.  I picked up a, uh, a scanner.  Right.  Picked up a police scanner, but it got everything. 
[01:24:30]  It got cell phones.  It got cordless phones.  Everything.  And, um, we used to sit around and just laugh our asses off, because you'd hear a bunch of  It was better than going to the movies, my friend.  It was better than a TV show.  Better than going to a bar and getting hammered.  Better than radio.  It was better than radio.  Right.  You, I would sit there for hours listening to people's cell phone calls, uh, guys cheating  on their wives, drug deals going down, just, uh, deviant sex calls.  It was great.  It was fantastic to listen to.  And, uh, one call we were listening to was, uh, a gay guy calling up a gay sex line, but 
[01:25:00]  it was like a chat room, uh, over the phone.  You call up the number.  And I guess whenever somebody...  It's like a party line or something.  Yeah, like a party line.  Whenever anyone else would call into the party line, you'd hear the bell ring, and it alerted  everyone that someone knew it was in, knew meat was in the sex room.  And it was all, 99% of it was them saying hello to each other, and is someone there?  Hello?  Hello, you...  Hi.  Hey, how are you?  You're in here, too? 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, yeah, just hanging out.  You know, looking for some...  Hello?  Hello?  Hi.  Hi, who are you?  Hi, how are you?  But you sound like me.  How many people are in here?  We all have this whispery, gay voice.  Everyone that's in the room, say hello.  Hello, hello.  Hi.  Hello, hello.  Hi.  Hello?  Oh, someone else.  New meat.  Hello?  And then they'd slowly get into what they're into, you know?  Not really, though.  Barely, I know.  Because no one wanted to make the first move.  Because, like, some guy, I remember, it would be like, oh, I'm so horny. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah, me, too.  And then before you get a sentence out, it was like, yeah, me...  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  New meat.  Hello?  Hello?  Oh, really?  And we were rolling, man.  It was really hysterical.  Hello?  Oh, it was very funny.  Okay, Anthony, by the way, the voting for the Naughty Naughty Contest ends in ten minutes.  Yes, it does.  Ten minutes.  Cast your last-minute ballads.  And by, like, 5.15, we will be announcing winners, so. 
[01:26:30]  Look at Carney from Jersey saying, Morgan, I've been voting for Anna, Amy, and Lisa, but  now all my votes will go to Morgan.  I saw a dance last night.  What an ass.  Holy ass.  I've never seen a chick climb through the rafters of a strip club before.  This chick is off the charts, hot in person.  It is craziness.  Her pictures do nothing for her.  This guy's like a stalker now.  Is that Morgan?  Morgan from Philly?  From Philly.  Remember?  Yeah, because she's dancing in Jerusalem.  I think that's when Rick wanted to win the whole damn thing.  Her pictures didn't do justice, but I don't think. 
[01:27:00]  There were some good shots, though.  I thought she was well-represented.  You know, when she dances around, you can tell she's, like, got the moves, and it kind  of adds to the look.  So, and go figure.  She's a dancer.  And she did not make the top five.  Oh, no.  Well, the last-minute voting might put her over the top.  That far away?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Wow, that is hard to believe.  So who's your leader?  We can't just say it like that, Mike.  Okay, Hope, okay, Hope.  I'm just asking. 
[01:27:30]  Do we ask you where you park all the cars?  In the basement.  In the basement.  Yeah, but you got spots and stuff.  Like, okay, this one goes over here.  This goes, you know.  Okay, okay.  Some people don't have to wait for their car.  Yeah, you know that.  VIP, you know?  VIP, man.  Mike, what's going on?  Mike, you got...  Yeah, I got my balls busted about the whole cell phone thing last week.  By your wife?  Yeah, she checked up on the bill.  She seen you guys' number.  I called last week that I wanted a drink in to be an Olympic sport, 
[01:28:00]  but I got cut off on the phone.  Man, your wife...  I don't understand that.  Your girlfriend or your wife doesn't trust you  where she's calling your phone numbers on your cell phone, bro?  No, I don't know.  She's Dutch.  She's a little Dutch girl from the Cole region in Pennsylvania.  She drives me batty.  Yeah.  All right, Mike.  Yeah, yeah, thanks, bro.  So she checks up on his phone calls?  Yeah.  Like she'll hit redial or something?  Yeah.  That redial has killed more guys, man.  Those dopey bastards calling their chicks or something. 
[01:28:30]  No, okay.  I'll see you.  Click.  Redial.  Hello?  Who's this?  Oh.  Click.  That's classic.  See, is that you?  Hello?  I got caller ID.  I know you're calling me.  Hi.  I'm so glad you called.  I'm going to bend over a chair and, who's this?  I mean.  Oh, man.  Next thing you know, the husband is calling another line. 
[01:29:00]  Hello?  Hello?  Hi, who's in here?  Hello?  Hello?  My wife castrated me and this is all I got left.  Hello?  Oh, I'm so horny.  Fun guy.  So horny.  Anthony, the other thing we should say about the Naughty Nighty winner.  Yeah.  Uh, we are going to bring her to New York.  Oh, yeah.  And put her on display later on this week.  Mm-hmm.  How do you know?  Maybe I was tricking everyone.  Oh, okay, okay, okay. 
[01:29:30]  Okay.  Oh, man.  Jeez.  Whoops.  All right.  Oops.  So New York did not win the Naughty Nighty contest.  Oh, hey.  Yeah.  You know, Mike, that comment probably went over a lot of people's heads, but you had to,  like, focus in on it.  Oh, she's not from New York, ma.  Oh, no, you said bring her from out of town, so I'll see.  All right, so, so far we know she's not from New York and she's not Morgan.  And it's not Morgan.  How many New York contestants were in the finals?  I don't even know.  I think how many?  Uh, two or three.  Wow. 
[01:30:00]  That's four people already that can be just eliminated.  Out of the 20.  Out of the 20.  Right.  All right.  Yeah.  But we're going to parade her around after one of our shows this week and invite everyone  out for a beer.  Yes.  Details on the way.  By the way, this isn't a tease as far as having our fine young lady here eating the lamb brains.  It's a torture tactic from us to her that she has to stand there this long staring at  those lamb brains.  And if we took a break right now, our listeners will kill us.  Fresh in the skulls.  Get a good one. 
[01:30:30]  So I think it's time for Sarah to do this.  We got to get Steve in here.  You know, you got some, uh, something to drink?  Yeah.  What do you got?  Some hot chocolate.  Ugh, hot chocolate.  Look at her.  She makes the little faces and everything like, uh.  Now she goes to hot chocolate.  Sarah, if you qualify, you're going to come back down from Cleveland to do this, right?  Yep.  I think we're going to do it in about a week.  Hopefully.  Yeah.  A week from Friday, we're thinking.  All right.  Well, Sarah from Cleveland's here, Anthony.  Yes.  To get into the 55-gallon drum challenge.  She has chosen to eat lamb brain right from the skull. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  Um, Jamaica, Mike?  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Do you see that round ball camera that's in front of you there?  Yeah, yeah, right.  Could you raise it up so it's facing, uh, Sarah?  There you go.  That's perfect.  Right there.  Right there.  You see that?  I'm good at doing this.  You are the man.  That's it, man.  All right.  Well, how do we want to do this, Ant?  Well, um, I just say she, she grabs a big heaping spoonful and, um, there's some great  pictures up on the stinky cam, by the way. 
[01:31:30]  Shovels it in her mouth.  That's what I say.  Wow, the pictures on the stinky cam are huge now.  Yeah.  Bravo!  It was like looking at a goddamn postage stamp for a while.  Yeah, it's nice.  Oh, we'll use this a lot more now.  All right, um, well, Sarah, in front of you is the, uh, the skull, with the spoon sticking  out of the skull.  Yeah.  Ben, you're going to be all right for this?  Yeah.  Uh, Frenchy is, uh, has prepared the skull, barely. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  Look, I'm on the stinky cam.  Look, I am on the stinky cam.  You stupid stinky cam.  Suck it, stinky cam.  Hey, Frenchy, Frenchy, stay behind Sarah so everyone can take a look at you.  So we can kill you.  We got so much heat on our show, they might as well take a glimpse of you.  Stinky cam.  You belong in the dump in Staten Island.  Staten Island.  You have nothing to say to Jamaican Mike, right? 
[01:32:30]  Jamaican Mike is a cool guy.  He's a cool guy.  Yeah, do you see that?  That's right.  He's not going to rip on me.  You know better, you know.  That's right.  He'll come down, his car will be on blocks.  He fucks my car every time I come in.  He's a cool guy.  Yeah, man.  Yeah, I'm on.  All right.  No one wants to see Frenchy.  Get Sarah in front of the skull.  All right, Sarah.  Get her right there on the stinky cam so we can see.  Why don't we mic Sarah?  All right, Sarah, here you go.  Sarah.  Oh, my God.  It looks like...  It does look like cat food, Anthony. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah, kind of holding.  Get a good one.  Very moist cat food.  Get a nice, big spoonful.  Sarah's making some really bad faces.  Yeah.  All right, she's trying to scoop out the brain from the skull.  She's having a tough time.  Ah!  It went flying everywhere.  Oh, God.  Frenchy, what was the...  Hold on, hold on, Sarah.  Don't smell it.  What does it smell like?  Rose beef, actually.  It smells like rose beef.  That's not the face you made when you sniffed it.  No.  All right, Sarah's got a spoonful of lamb brain in front of her. 
[01:33:30]  Go ahead, Sarah.  And she's got the spoonful in her mouth.  Swallow it.  Swallow it.  Just swallow it.  Oh, there's little pieces of brain chunks in there.  There's skull.  She's not going to survive, guys.  She's not going to make it.  She's not going to make it.  She's not going to make it.  She's not going to make it.  Swallow, swallow, swallow.  Oh, my God.  She drank some hot chocolate to get it down.  See, the worst part is, now you've got to do another one, and you know how bad it is. 
[01:34:00]  Wait, wait.  Did we get any of those pictures, Rick?  Where you're snapping?  Oh, was it, Kay?  Is she crying?  You look like your eyes are watering, though.  Look at the faces she's making.  All right, hold on.  Here she comes.  All right, here you go.  All right, she's...  All right, Swallow.  She's got a little spoonful of lamb brain.  Swallow, she's dry even.  Yeah, there you go.  You okay?  I'm not going to make it.  You all right, Sarah?  And she did it.  All right.  All right, that's great.  That's great.  You are in.  The 55-gallon drug challenge.  How did it taste? 
[01:34:30]  Not bad.  Not bad?  You seem to be really skeeved out about it, though.  Yeah, what were you skeeved at?  Was the texture bad?  Were you pulling pieces of skull out of it?  Yeah.  Yeah, what were you pulling?  The brain...  Skull fragments?  Oh.  Wow.  See, you're all shivery and everything.  You got the heebie-jeebies, don't you?  I think I'm going to drop tonight.  Are you going to puke, you think?  How about one more scoop?  Oh.  Kind of like the encore, Anthony.  No, poor girl.  What?  No one else wants to... 
[01:35:00]  What?  Are you going to puke?  No.  Do you feel a little queasy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  One more.  One more.  One more scoop.  One more scoop.  One more scoop.  One more scoop.  One more scoop.  She's going to go for it.  One more scoop.  Get a good one.  One scoop.  She's going for it.  All right.  One more scoop.  She's being a trooper.  What a trooper she is.  She's going to do good in the 55-gallon drum challenge, Anthony.  And Sarah from Cleveland, she can't even dig out another scoop.  Is there any brains left there, Frenchie? 
[01:35:30]  Yes, a lot.  No?  Oh, there's a lot?  Okay.  Oh.  That's a nice big spoonful of brains.  Frenchie's got a whole scoop.  Rick is taking pictures.  They'll be up on opianthony.com.  She's got a face.  Look at a face.  Awesome.  Oh, yeah.  She's not happy now.  No, no.  That's it.  That's it.  That's great.  We might have pushed her a little too far.  Very good, Sarah.  Thank you.  Was it worth it? 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  It was worth coming down from Cleveland?  All right.  You're going to have fun for the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Anthony, we now have four contestants for the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Yes, we do.  We have Becky from Brockton, Stephanie from Taunton, Double L.  C from Cleveland.  And now we've got to add Sarah from Cleveland to the list, Anthony.  Right.  Tomorrow, I forgot her name, but she's coming in.  Maria.  Maria.  There's two Marias coming in then?  Because wasn't the other girl in Maria?  The girl that's chugging the pig's blood is Maria. 
[01:36:30]  And then we have another girl that's going to be in brown panties as we fill super soakers  up with lamb blood.  We got the lamb blood.  It's already in the fridge, and we're going to shoot lamb blood all over.  Using super soakers.  Great.  We only have, I think, like three to four more spots left in the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Look at the last snapshot that was on the stinky cam.  It says everything.  It's hurt.  Sarah's disgusted.  She is so disgusted, staring down at the actual skull in horror. 
[01:37:00]  You froze that image?  Yeah, that's the frozen image.  Good.  Go to opedataly.com.  She looks so, so distressed there.  Check out the stinky cam.  You look like you're ready to just cry.  This is her chewing.  Oh, God.  Yeah, that's good.  All right.  Do you want to see those pictures?  Yeah.  Yeah, Rick, show her pictures.  Show the pictures.  Rick got some great shots of her just eating the lamb brain.  We'll get those up in a little while. 
[01:37:30]  Anthony, we're going to take a break.  When we get back, it's about time.  It's a contest that's been going on for about two and a half years.  We will announce the top five in the Naughty 90 contest and the girl that won it all.  Yes.  Can't wait.  Let's go to the F.U. line real fast.  Naughty 90 next.  Thanks for calling.  And here's the oped Anthony F.U. line.  Yeah, I just want to give a big F.U. to Marion.  You sound like a retard.  Hey, ONA, why don't you ask her who the U.S. lost to in the gold medal hockey game? 
[01:38:00]  It might be Canada.  You sound like an idiot.  Next message.  Yeah, this is a big, seeming double F.U.  One to my ex-blaws, you tool.  You're white.  Quit playing in a friggin' reggae band.  And the second one's for my ex-girlfriend, Dana.  Yeah, I hope you're happy with your new sugar daddy.  Dude, she's just using you for money and status.  Get out while you can.  F.U.  Next message.  I want to send a big F.U. to that whore-backed bitch who waited until the end of the day, 
[01:38:30]  two hours before I leave for vacation, to give me all the edits.  I gave you the proof six days ago, you effing whore.  I want to wrap you in barbed wire, shove your head in a bear trap,  throw you onto a bunch of steak knives,  and grudge you, your fat jujube-eating ass, you fat effing whore.  This is like therapy.  End of message.  F.U. 
[01:39:00]  I love snatch.  B.U.  Bring on the whores.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  You filthy crazy.  Where's that anthrax?  That's going to make a sweeper.  Where's the caboose?  M.E.W.  I wanted that one.  I didn't get that one in time. 
[01:39:30]  How you guys doing?  My bad.  My bad.  How you guys doing?  How you guys doing?  How you guys doing?  How you guys doing?  How you guys doing?  My bad.  My bad. 
[01:40:00]  I didn't get to check them.  All right.  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Yep.  John, what's going on, bro?  How much?  All right.  What do you got?  Dude, you guys got nothing on Fear Factor.  It's just really sick.  What?  What have you got?  What people have to do to get on your show and do things?  Well, the girls are coming up with this.  They're coming out of the woodwork.  We're turning down girls left and right now.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah? 
[01:40:30]  We only got like three spots left in the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Yeah, there's a lot of money at stake, man.  Oh, I know that.  But, I mean, if you look at everything you guys done between the puke, people eating clam chard  and puke and then eating the puke, it's just terrible what you guys do.  Well, today was quite interesting.  The skull just sitting on the counter and Sarah scooping out the brain with a spoon.  I got to say something here.  Mike from Queens, what a dick. 
[01:41:00]  Not that I don't believe you guys, but the lamb head looks kind of fake.  Are you out of your mind?  Look at the pic on the stinky cam and look.  It looks like your studio with a cut-out picture of a lamb's head placed on top of your studio background.  Look closely and see later.  Guys, you suck.  Are you out of your mind?  I can't believe some of these people. 
[01:41:30]  It's fake, dude.  We're going to need a window like the Today Show so you can just walk on by and check it out for yourself.  Come down here.  Wait, where is that guy?  In Queens.  Come on down.  Mike from Queens.  Come down here.  Come down right now.  Before the end of the show.  And if that thing is real, you have to eat a spoonful of lamb brain.  Come on down.  Out of the fake cardboard lamb head.  You're calling up on something. 
[01:42:00]  Come on down.  You come down.  Check it out for yourself.  You can compare the picture that's on the internet with the actual skull in the studio.  But if it's real, like we say, and like 99% of the people know it is, you have to eat some of the lamb brain.  We're here until 7.  Come on down.  So come on down.  Come on down.  Or tongue it.  Yeah, you've got to tongue kiss the skull.  All right, Ant.  We've got to get down to business here.  Well, today...  The Naughty Nighty Contest is officially over.  Yes. 
[01:42:30]  It started, I don't know, around Christmas maybe.  When did we start the Naughty Nighty Contest?  97.  No, seriously.  When did we start, though?  When was it?  When we went down to Philly?  No, it was even before we went to Philly.  It was a week after we went to Philly.  Yeah.  February.  So it's been well over a month.  Yeah.  And...  We had almost 100 girls get pictures taken all over the country.  Yes.  And then our fine listeners have been voting for over a week now.  Well, like two weeks of voting, I guess. 
[01:43:00]  And it's time to announce the winner, Anthony.  Yes, it is.  This is for the trip to Hedonism 3.  So I'm a little surprised at some of the results.  A little surprised.  Just a little.  Well, pleasantly in some ways.  And I'm a little boggled by others.  Well, it was up to the listeners.  I know.  We left it in their hands.  So what we got is we got the five finalists on the phone, Anthony. 
[01:43:30]  And in no particular order, we're just going to announce the top five here.  Get them all on the air and then we'll announce who won the damn thing.  Okay?  Yeah.  So in no particular order.  Let's go to Lisa, number 97.  Right.  Representing Boston, Massachusetts.  Hi, guys.  Hi, Lisa.  One of our top five contestants here.  Lisa, we didn't get to see you live.  No, you didn't.  You decided to come in after we left Boston. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  You guys were in New Orleans when I came in.  After the Chowder Bowl.  Yeah.  And I must say you're beautiful.  Thank you very much.  You have a very nice naughty nightie.  Thank you.  I like the picture of you with the hot pants and the sunglasses.  I'm looking.  With the little shirt and stuff and the white high heels.  Yeah.  Very hot shot.  The retro shot with the hot pants.  Very nice.  Now, Lisa, a lot of people want to know, do you dance in Boston? 
[01:44:30]  No, I don't.  No?  No.  What do you do?  I work for a freight forwarding company.  I work a full-time job, no dancing.  You don't know how much money you can make with a body like that?  Have you considered dancing or you just...  Did you used to?  No.  I've never danced.  Don't want to.  Well, you must be the hit of the...  What do you do?  I work for a freight forwarding company.  I do reports.  So, like, the guy's always checking you out? 
[01:45:00]  A little bit.  Is it true that your mom got upset because of your pictures?  She was very upset, yes.  Why?  You're not really showing anything, are you?  Just the point.  It's my mom, you know?  She's just jealous.  Yeah.  Wow.  And, Lisa, how old are you?  23.  23.  Very, very lovely.  Thank you.  All right.  So, there's Lisa, one of our top fives, Anthony.  Hold on, okay, Lisa?  Thanks.  We're going to put all the girls on at the same time in a minute here.  Okay.  All right.  In no particular order, Ann, let's go to contestant number 37. 
[01:45:30]  Oh, Stephanie.  Representing Washington, D.C.  D.C.  We've talked to Stephanie a few times.  We know her deal.  You're not dancing, Stephanie.  No, I'm not.  Great body.  We learned that you have breast implants, and it was a very nice job by the doctor.  Thanks.  What else did we learn about you?  That I work for an oral surgeon.  Oh, that's right.  That's right.  I knew oral was involved somewhere. 
[01:46:00]  Have people started recognizing you?  One person did.  Just one person, huh?  Yeah, I was out at the club.  You know how many people have checked out your pictures all over the world?  No.  A lot, probably.  A real lot.  Yeah.  All right.  So you made the top five.  We've talked to her, so let's put her on hold.  Hold on, Steph.  Okay.  All right.  So that's two out of the top five, Anthony.  Uh-huh.  Next, let's go to, uh, Daniela from Sacramento, Anthony.  Where's that, 93?  Let me punch it up.  Contestant number 93.  I always like punching up the pictures here so I can, it feels like I'm talking right to 
[01:46:30]  the person.  She was in.  Oh, yeah.  She was featured in Penthouse.  Yes, you were in Penthouse.  Did you guys get it yet?  We didn't get your Penthouse.  Well, it should be there any time.  You said that last week when we talked to you.  I sent it to you guys.  I told you I did.  Well, hopefully we'll get it soon.  They opened the mail upstairs, so I'm assuming someone else is enjoying it.  Did somebody take it?  Your layout in Penthouse.  What else do we know about Daniela from Sacramento, Anthony? 
[01:47:00]  Well, she's got three different outfits on her, uh, yeah, voting site.  I know that much.  Well, they took a lot of pictures of her.  Each one better than the last.  She's quite lovely.  And if you guys want to see more pictures, can I name my website?  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Can I?  Can I?  The voting's over, so it won't sway the voting.  I know, but it's nude pictures.  It's always good to go and see nude pictures.  Well, you're supposed to give us the website first so we can approve it to make sure it's,  uh, worthy.  All right.  She says it fast enough.  I'll get through it before the delay.  All right. 
[01:47:30]  Go ahead, Danielle.  It's www.leftcoastgirls.com.  Leftcoastgirls.com?  Mm-hmm.  All right, we're going there right now.  Thank you.  Daniela also took a shower for us live on the air, Anthony.  And screwed up my phone.  Screwed up your phone?  Where are you?  Where are you?  I'm in the house right now, and I'm not in the house.  No, I mean on the website.  Just please enter.  Oh, it's under Darien.  Under.  Enter.  Go to Left Coast Girls.  Yeah.  Yeah, we got that.  Okay, and then go to Darien.  I'm like the first girl.  Oh, no.  Darien. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  We can't find Darien.  Why?  Oh, my God.  Where's your name?  Hold on.  We got it, right?  Okay.  Okay, we got it.  We got it.  Wow.  Darien.  Measurements.  34, 24, 35.  Brown eyes.  Brown hair.  Oh.  High five six.  Available for.  Wait, wait.  Available for.  Printwork.  Swimsuit.  Lingerie.  Fashion.  Promotional work.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Look at her nude pictures.  Are these pictures that were featured in Penthouse? 
[01:48:30]  No, these are just pictures done by Eric Melendez.  He does all my photography.  Isn't he in prison for killing his father with his brother?  No, that's somebody else.  Oh, Melendez.  And, Anthony, we also learned that Daniela listens to the Opie and Anthony show.  Yes, I do.  Yes.  All right, Daniela, you're one of our top five finalists here.  Okay.  Hold on the line.  There you go.  All right, I will.  Daniela from Sacramento, Anthony.  Yeah.  Up next, in no particular order, let's go to Amy from New York. 
[01:49:00]  Number two.  Amy.  Hi, guys.  Teen Amy.  No, no, no.  This isn't Teen Amy.  No, that's right.  No.  You're out of teens.  I'm out of teens, guys.  I wanted a teen in there.  No, I don't think we got any teens in the top five.  Amy is from Hot Something Wide.  Yes, yes.  Which one were you?  Well, actually, the site is shut down now.  Uh-oh.  What happened?  That's a really long story.  Oh, no.  I had to shut it down.  All right, hold on.  You can't.  No, you can't just leave us.  You got to tell us what happened.  You got to give us something. 
[01:49:30]  Okay.  Tell me you're getting a divorce because of this nonsense.  You guys are too nervous.  What's wrong with you guys?  What do you mean?  It was no problem.  You guys could have shot any way you wanted me.  Oops.  I guess you guys were a little nervous that my hubby was around, huh?  Amy, what the F are you talking about?  Well, when I went into the studio and I got the pictures taken, it seems as though you  guys were a little bit nervous about taking the pictures because my husband was there.  Oh, yeah, because you're so hot.  What are you talking about? 
[01:50:00]  No, Rick, I'm serious.  Rick got great photos of you.  I could have gotten much better.  Well, it was up to you, too, to suggest things.  You're right.  You're right.  All right, so why did your website get shut down?  Well, I guess since being on your show, I was found out by the wrong person, and it  was a matter of what's doing more, the website or other things.  You know what I mean?  Well, that's clear.  Yeah.  Well, you know, I can't be too specific. 
[01:50:30]  Did your daddy find out about the website?  No, no, it had nothing to do with family.  Please.  No?  No, not at all.  Wait, your husband pretty much runs the site, so who had the problem?  No, no.  No, actually, it was just work-related with my husband's side.  Oh, so your husband's work.  Right.  Your husband has a real job.  Yes.  Aside from the website, and all of a sudden, word got out, and...  Hey, Frank, I don't know how to tell you this, but your wife's thinking all over the internet.  Yeah, right.  No S, Sherlock.  I saw your wife on the internet. 
[01:51:00]  Holy S.  Did he get to TF those things?  Some water cooler talk, maybe, going down at your husband's place at work?  Something like that.  So you shut down this lucrative website of yours?  Well, it wasn't as lucrative as what he's doing, so, you know, we've got to pay the bills.  Ah.  You know what I'm saying?  Why?  Did the company give him an ultimatum?  Pretty much.  Now, you should have shot your pictures with a tarp.  Yeah, right?  Yes. 
[01:51:30]  Camouflaging the background.  Ah, you should have spoken with Jeremy Coleman.  Call back to 320 today.  Okay, go ahead.  In all reality, I'm not ashamed of my website.  All right.  I'm proud, and then that's it.  I had fun.  Okay.  You guys are the best.  All right, Amy.  So you're one of the top five here.  Okay, cool.  All right.  Obviously, she wasn't listening 20 minutes ago.  Yeah.  Let's go to our last finalist.  Another.  Teen Nikki.  No.  Oh, damn it. 
[01:52:00]  Another girl representing the fine, fine city of Sacramento, California.  Two girls in the top five, Anthony.  It's Nikki.  And one of the biggest fans of the Opie and Anthony show.  She would be number 69.  We quizzed her, and we found out she has no effing idea who we are.  She never listens to the show.  But she's hot just the same.  Hi, Nikki.  Hi.  Have you started listening to us ever since that day?  You know, I work eight to five every day. 
[01:52:30]  Come on, Nikki.  You said you'd give us a try.  Nothing.  Nothing.  I actually did hear that show when you guys ripped me to shreds.  I did hear that one.  What?  We ripped you to shreds?  I did have that day off, so I got to listen to that one.  What did we say?  Well, we didn't know.  Well, when you guys were quizzing me and all that.  Oh, well, you were there.  It's tough to rip a girl that looks like you to shreds.  There's nothing we can say.  No.  I thought you were a listener at this point.  I thought we had something going on when we had that exchange.  Yeah, I thought maybe that would be the thing like, 
[01:53:00]  Oh, I better listen now.  My career is more important, unfortunately.  And what's your career?  Oh, I'm interning at a medical office.  I'm a med student.  You're a med student.  That's a med student?  Oh, my God.  Nice.  What the hell's going on there?  Nice and nice.  Turn and call for me, please.  All right, Nikki.  I have something on my junk.  There's really nothing to say to you because you have decided that you really don't care 
[01:53:30]  about us and our radio show and that you're doing this for a free trip to Hedonism 3.  But it's okay.  I mean.  But at least we understand each other, right?  That's not true.  It is true.  You guys, this show is great.  The few times that I have got to listen to it.  Oh, no, no, no.  You just admitted you only heard us that day that we ripped you apart for not listening.  That means you've heard one show.  You don't work between three and seven?  Three and seven.  Yeah.  No, she works eight to five.  I work two jobs. 
[01:54:00]  I work eight to five.  Then I work six to 12.  Do you realize that people, they tape our show if they can't listen to it?  Well, it's not that important.  All right.  Well, Nikki is in the top five, Anthony.  Yes.  It's time to announce this.  Let's get all the girls on there.  Let's get all the girls on there.  This better work.  All right.  So we got Nikki.  Yeah.  From Sacramento, number 69.  All right.  If you're following along at home.  Let's go to Amy.  Amy, you there?  Amy?  Amy?  Yeah. 
[01:54:30]  Okay.  Amy's there from New York, contestant number two.  This is so exciting, isn't it?  Let's go to Lisa from Boston.  Contestant number 97.  Lisa?  Hi.  She's there.  Daniela from Sacramento, California.  Contestant number 93.  Hi.  Oh, my goodness.  Can the phones handle this?  Pete Johnson, did you make it so we can take five calls at the same time?  Uh-oh.  I don't think we can.  Oh, no.  Oh, what happened, Pete Johnson? 
[01:55:00]  He hasn't set up.  We can only get four.  Oh, no.  What happened, Pete?  All right.  Hold on.  All right.  Hold on, ladies.  All the girls, hold on.  We got to call Stephanie on the national line, and then we could do something here.  Oh, they're missing a girl.  Yeah.  We can hear all of you, everything you're saying.  So, all right.  As we try to get Stephanie on the line, we could all just kind of hang out in this room and  get to know each other.  Hello. 
[01:55:30]  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  How are you?  Anyone else in here?  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hope you're getting too close.  Step back, Hope.  Hello.  Step back a little, Hopey.  Hi.  Hi.  Anyone here?  Hopey.  What's your name?  Hello.  I'm horny.  God, I'm so horny today.  Anybody else horny in here?  Hello.  Hello.  Ew.  Ew.  I hear girls giggling.  Who gave them the number? 
[01:56:00]  That's disgusting.  Girls, don't even talk.  Hello.  Hello.  Please be a guy.  Please be a guy.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Please be a guy.  No, that must mean Stephanie's going to join the conversation, Ant.  Where is she?  Stephanie.  Hello.  Hi.  Hi.  Oh, all right.  We got everybody.  Everyone's on.  I told you I would work it out.  You have to improvise, adapt, overcome, simplify.  All right.  Stephanie, contestant number 37, another one of the top five contestants in the Naughty 
[01:56:30]  Nighty Contest.  Anthony.  What's that sound?  What?  Somebody go to the bathroom.  What was that?  It sounded like a toilet flush.  Okay.  Well, Opie, our five finalists are on the phone right now.  One by one.  Coming in.  Fifth place in the Naughty Nighty Contest.  And no bitching and whining.  That's right.  It was up to the listeners of the Opie and Anthony show.  We had no say in the final voting.  It was completely up to the listeners voting on the website. 
[01:57:00]  Goddamn.  The longest drum roll ever.  Oh, my God.  Come on, guys.  Jesus, Rick.  Where'd you find that?  That is the lamest drum roll ever.  You have a shorter one?  All right.  All right.  We're going to have to go through it with every one of them.  In fifth place in the Naughty Nighty Contest, from New York City, number two, Amy.  Amy. 
[01:57:30]  Hey.  Uh-uh.  Thank you.  He's got a little disappointed, but Amy, did you think you were going to win?  Um, honestly, you want to hear a weird story?  I had a dream that last night I was in sixth place.  Sixth?  Sixth.  Wow, that's weird.  Your dream was one place off.  That's right.  That's kind of weird.  Hey, it's cool, though.  I had a lot of fun.  All right.  Any final thoughts?  No, you guys rock.  Okay.  You win a prize pack, whatever the F that means.  All right. 
[01:58:00]  That means Earl will dig into the prize closet and find some piece of crap to hand you.  Go F yourself.  So, Amy, thank you for doing the Naughty Nighty Contest.  Thank you, guys.  And good luck to the rest of the girls.  All right.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Okay.  Bye-bye.  All right.  Now, remember, this field narrowed down from a field of about 95 girls, 98 girls.  So, you're all winners.  Amy's got to hang up now.  Okay.  Good night.  Bye.  Because we can't hang up on you.  So, nighty night.  Bye.  Bye.  It's kind of like the weakest link.  Get out of here. 
[01:58:30]  Go.  Yeah, it is like the weakest link.  The weakest link.  Because they're brutal.  No, you know why?  Because we can't hang up the phone without all you girls maybe getting hung up on the  door.  All right, man.  We're down to four girls.  Four girls.  Here we go with the drum roll.  Fourth place, as decided by our listeners in the Naughty Nighty Contest.  Phil and Phil.  Well, we're talking fourth place, which is one place above third, but it is below the fifth.  Unless you're doing it in terms of winning, then it is truly above fifth and below third. 
[01:59:00]  Thank you, Rick.  Fourth place in the Naughty Nighty Contest.  She has no clue who we are.  Oh, it's Nikki.  From Sacramento, California, contestant number 69.  Nikki.  Nikki.  Thank you.  Who's squealing in the background?  Who's squealing in the background?  Who is that?  That's not my line. 
[01:59:30]  Who is it?  Daniela.  Daniela's squealing?  I just get really excited sometimes.  Oh, you get excited as they get, like, one after another falls to the waistline.  Any girls want to moan or anything?  Oh, jeez.  Well, Nikki, thank you so much for participating.  Perhaps you'll find some time to listen to the program.  But I don't think that had any bearing on the voting.  Because you're very hot.  And, yeah.  And, well, you lost.  Well, thank you so much.  Congratulations, ladies. 
[02:00:00]  And we're going to send you a prize pack, Nikki.  Oh, I'm looking forward to it.  A prize pack.  All right.  Any final thoughts?  Do you want to talk to anyone that voted for you?  What do you want to say to the people?  Oh, no.  Just it was fine.  And congratulations to the girl, Eric.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  There goes Nikki.  I can buy my own trip to hedonism.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you, Nikki.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye, Nikki.  You have to hang up, Nikki.  Okay?  There she goes.  There you go.  Somehow I feel we will never, ever, ever, ever hear from her again. 
[02:00:30]  Hey, girls who are still on the line?  Yeah.  You guys will continue listening to us, right?  Yeah.  You're the top three.  As long as you don't get that old lady, the psychiatrist, sex psychiatrist, on again.  Oh, what?  What's her name?  Which one?  Nora.  The one that says that the girls need to satisfy their men.  Right.  Otherwise, they cheat.  Nora Hayden.  Nora Hayden.  Who are we talking to here?  Daniela.  Daniela from Penthoosh.  Nora Hayden's out of her mind.  The woman's got Alzheimer's. 
[02:01:00]  She's a crazy fraud.  She's a lunatic.  Yeah, but...  You need to lock her up.  Yeah, but she told a great story about being in the hospital after her husband, you know...  Quite possibly one of the greatest stories ever told on this.  When you're looking at an old broad that is like your grandma sitting there trying to talk about sex,  and then she conveys a lovely story of how her husband wanted balloon knot backdoor action so badly  that she figured she'd give in and have him do it and ended up limping to the hospital. 
[02:01:30]  What did I tell you guys?  She knew all about everything and honestly not enough.  That's right.  See, Daniela listens to our show, Anthony.  I like this one.  Yes.  Okay.  Are we ready for third place?  Third place.  In the Naughty Nighty contest, she'll walk away with $250, by the way.  $250?  Not bad, not bad.  And third place in our Naughty Nighty contest.  The place being third, just above second, above fourth. 
[02:02:00]  Great number three.  Two of them put together, make an eighth, but that has nothing to do with third.  Coming in third place, and she wins $250.  Yes.  From Boston, Massachusetts.  Yes.  Contestant number 97.  It's Lisa.  And Lisa, we're going to throw in a Godsmack CD.  Oh, thank you guys. 
[02:02:30]  You know those guys?  They're from up there.  Yeah.  Oh, you do?  Yeah, they rock.  Do you like Godsmack, Lisa?  You know.  You know what?  What do we know?  I heard you guys on the radio talking about me last week.  What?  Hey, don't sully this call with anything.  What?  What happened?  Thank you guys.  There you go.  Any final words?  No, just I had a lot of fun, and good luck to you girls. 
[02:03:00]  Thank you.  Bye.  Hey, Lisa, next time we're in Boston, you know, you've got to, you know, come out with us  when we do a road show so we can introduce you to the crowd and all that, all right?  Oh, she hung up.  Oh, me.  Oh, God.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let me turn away feeling all embarrassed for a second.  Hold on.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, God.  I need some light.  Look at what he's doing now.  Oh, boy.  Okay.  I mean, it's like, oh, God, did you just get blown off. 
[02:03:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Hold on.  I've got to recover from this.  Let me pick my jaw off the floor.  Oh, yeah.  You have to play that back to find out what's going on in the background.  Hey, why do we do it to ourselves, though?  I was feeling good.  I was feeling good.  I want to be a little friendly with her.  Hot chick.  Loves the show.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm feeling a vibe like she's laughing at some of our jokes and stuff.  Hey, what the hell?  Hey, when we're up in Boston, why don't we go? 
[02:04:00]  Click.  Click.  Oh, my God.  Ooh, okay.  All right, Anthony.  So we got two left.  Do we do it beauty pageant style, or do we just go for number one?  With number two, understanding what just happened.  We'll go for number one.  Okay.  Number two will understand that she got second place, so we will announce the winner right  now.  This will be the winner.  And, of course, second place will be the runner-up, and she will have to assume the 
[02:04:30]  duties of the winner of the Naughty Nighty contest if the winner cannot assume the duties.  That's right.  The duties are nothing.  Girls, what's going through your heads right now?  What are you thinking, girls?  Do you have a thought between you?  What?  Very nervous.  I want some ice cream.  I want some ice cream, Anthony.  Yes.  All right, nervous, and I want some ice cream.  Good.  All right.  Ladies and gentlemen.  You have 18 cities listening, and I'm nervous, and I want some ice cream. 
[02:05:00]  All right.  If we can now announce the winner of the Naughty Nighty contest.  Of the Naughty Nighty contest.  Oh, by the way, before any other ladies hang up on us.  Oh, yeah, yeah, okay.  Before you guys hang up on us, will we be hanging with you?  Look at you getting the safety net out.  Right.  Before you hang up in disgust, is there a possibility we'll hang with you? 
[02:05:30]  Of course.  Not in a sexual way, but just in a, hey, look at us.  We're cool.  We got hot chicks, and hey, guys, check out our hot chick friends.  Of course.  Hey, if there's going to be a second place, if I'm going to get it, I'll fly out to New  York and visit you guys.  That's nice.  All right.  That's nice.  Okay, Anthony.  Nothing the same.  Here we go.  Anthony, the big buildup.  Opie, we might as well tell what the grand and second prize is right now before we do  announce.  All right, yeah.  Second place will win $500, and first place will win the trip to Hedonism 3. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  Is there a tagline for the Hedonism 3 trip?  It's already all done.  It's all done.  We're set there.  Okay, Ed, take it away.  Ladies and gentlemen, it's between contestant number 93, Daniella from Sacramento, and contestant  number 37, Stephanie from D.C.  And the winner, as chosen by our audience, due to the pictures on the website, they went  there, chose, 98 girls started, two remains. 
[02:06:30]  The winner of the Dondon Knights is Stephanie, number 37 from D.C.  Stephanie, coming in second, of course, that's a winner, is Daniella, the beautiful Daniella  from Penthouse, second place.  Thank you.  Hold on, hold on, ladies.  I'll be a Miss America.  And I'll be flying in second, my heart. 
[02:07:00]  You're a girl.  Someday, when they sing their singing, they'll put the crown on me.  Could you shut up?  And then you'll make a lot of things on TV.  Oh!  Now we're having fun.  And I am in seven.  Wish somebody put this retard out of his misery.  I'll tell the world to make this stuff in your yard. 
[02:07:30]  This is legal, isn't it?  And what fun's gonna be when we just sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing,  Oh, someday, someday, someday, someday, someday, someday, someday, someday, I'll be Miss America.  Oh!  Is that supposed to be sexy? 
[02:08:00]  Sweet, merciful crap!  Oh, my God.  So, there you have it, coming in second place from Penthouse.  Yeah, yeah!  The Dutch version of Penthouse.  You know her, you love her.  Yes.  Daniella from Sacramento, contestant number 93.  Thank you, guys.  Congratulations, Daniella.  Thank you.  Obviously, that's not too shabby whatsoever.  What, sorry, say that again?  Uh, that wasn't too shabby. 
[02:08:30]  Not too shabby.  It's great.  Like I said, I'll get a ticket to New York and come and visit you guys.  You do that.  I will.  Uh, we got another, uh, contest coming up in about a month.  And what is that?  And I do believe you'll be entering again.  I will?  Oh, yeah.  What is it?  We can't talk about it yet.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  You better keep listening.  Some learning guys having secrets from me.  That's not fair.  You better keep listening to the Opie and Anthony show.  I will.  Hey, maybe a few girls are...  Click.  Uh, Daniella, any final words? 
[02:09:00]  Any thoughts?  Just thank you, everybody, for voting.  Thanks, Leon, for the pictures.  And thanks for the...  Prompt to every girl.  Every girl looked beautiful.  And Sacramento rocks.  And so do you guys.  And, you know, not to take away from Stephanie, who is our grand prize winner here, but I do  believe the strategy that Sacramento took...  Yeah.  ...backfired.  I think so.  Backfired.  Too many hot chicks.  They had three or four...  Three or four hot chicks to pick from, so, like, the local vote was very confused.  They didn't know which way to go.  A lot of Ross Peros in there, ruining the vote. 
[02:09:30]  A couple of Ralph Nader's thrown in there, you know what I mean?  Yeah.  Nikki was like a Ralph Nader.  Well, Stephanie, you look great.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  And have fun in Jamaica.  All right.  Thank you.  And, Danielle, why don't you tell everyone where you dance?  I dance at the Ambers in Sacramento on Auburn Boulevard, Wednesdays and Friday nights from  7 to 2.  And you get a lot of people coming by now saying...  Oh, yeah.  Everybody's been trying to vote.  Oh, good.  All right.  Well, congratulations, Danielle.  Thank you.  Once again, thank you very much. 
[02:10:00]  And, Danielle, keep in touch, all right?  Sorry?  Click.  I know.  It is messing with you.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  All right.  Props to all the girls.  Even the girls that look like they walked into props.  There's a couple of them on the list.  Not many.  All right.  And, Danielle, there goes Danielle.  Yeah.  We'd hang up on you, Danielle, but...  Do I need to hang up or what do I...  Yeah.  You've got to hang up or we might lose somebody.  Okay.  Bye.  Bye.  There she goes.  There she goes, Danielle.  Very attractive girl.  Very nice. 
[02:10:30]  Knows the show.  She was in Penthouse.  And, uh...  Supposedly, we still haven't received our copy of Penthouse.  I'm willing to, I believe her.  All right.  Stephanie.  Stephanie.  Representing Washington, D.C.  Let me tell you something about Stephanie.  What a day for D.C.  We can finally announce this.  Stephanie, you ran away with the contest.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was ridiculous.  What's going to happen is we're going to post all the votes up on opiananthony.com.  Scott is working on that right now.  For the top, um...  The top 20. 
[02:11:00]  20?  So, you'll see where your girl placed and how many votes she got from 20 all the way  to first.  But, Stephanie, you pretty much ran away with the damn thing.  20.  And, uh...  I guess we're flying you up or you're going to jump on a train and come up to New York?  Yeah.  Uh, what day is this happening?  Thursday.  Uh, I think Thursday.  All right.  Uh, Stephanie, contestant number 37, the grand prize winner of the Naughty 90 contest, will  be in New York on Thursday.  After the show, we're going to go down to either Hooters or one of the, uh, the joints  around, uh, the station so our New York listeners can get a glimpse of Stephanie in the flesh. 
[02:11:30]  Mm-hmm.  Stephanie, you've got to pick out a nice, nice, uh, outfit for the event.  All right?  Okay.  I'll go shopping.  Huh?  I'll go shopping.  All right.  Good.  And I think, uh, we're going to, we're going to work it out where we go to Washington and  show everybody in Washington, uh, their hometown girl who won the Naughty 90 contest, right?  Right.  By the way, was that John Vanay Ramsey?  No.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  That was, I know.  A lot of people thought.  No, no.  I honestly thought it was John Vanay.  John Vanay! 
[02:12:00]  That is going to be stuck in my head.  It was, uh, it was that HBO special.  Oh, that's right.  I knew all that.  I knew I'd heard it somewhere.  Not all the four and five year olds that, uh, you know, enter all these pageants.  Four and five, they had an 18 month category if I remember correctly.  So, uh, Stephanie, you're coming up to New York and we're going to, you know, have some  drinks with the listeners and then, uh, in the very near, in the very near future, we're  going to, we're going to go down to Washington, DC, broadcast live from WJFK and do the same 
[02:12:30]  damn thing in Washington.  We're going to figure all that out, uh, soon.  Oh, cool.  All right.  All right?  It'll be fun.  Yeah.  Well, Stephanie, congratulations.  Thank you.  You have won the trip to Hedonism 3.  Oh, I'm excited.  Any, uh, any final thoughts?  No.  I'll make sure I bring back some wow pics for you guys.  What?  Some wow pics.  Oh, more wow pics, Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  Very nice.  All right, Steph, we're going to let you go.  Okay.  Uh, you know what?  We're going to need to play this out here. 
[02:13:00]  Someday, I'll be a mess of man.  Okay, terrific.  And I'll be shy and say, my love.  It's torture.  It's torture.  It's torture.  It's torture.  It's torture.  Someday, when they think that she is, they'll put the crown on me.  And then you'll make a lot of feet on TV. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, someday.  And don't be stupid.  When I am in America, I'll be the one to make sure you start when you're young.  And what fun's gonna be when we just see this on TV.  Oh, someday. 
[02:14:00]  I'll be here someday.  You know, my brother, you've got to buy your own.  Oh, wow.  Let it be America.  Ooh, ooh, ooh.  All right.  How about a nice bucket of eggs?  Hold on.  Hold on.  A bunch of people wanted to say hi real fast.  Andrew from D.C., what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, ma'am.  I want to say congratulations to Stephanie.  I also want to say that this is a sign that you guys are not in the tank in Washington, D.C. 
[02:14:30]  Maybe you weren't listening earlier.  We got some good news from D.C.  We got a sign of life today.  We got a pulse when the ratings came out.  Oh, we got a slight pulse in the ratings today.  All right.  Well, you know, there's a bunch of closet listeners around here.  They just don't want to admit to those poor guys.  I got the wow sign in the back of the car.  I haven't seen anything yet, but there's still hope.  It takes time.  We haven't even really pushed wow for all the newer cities.  That is going to happen in a matter of weeks.  And warmer.  All right, Andrew. 
[02:15:00]  Thank you.  Jay on Line 4 writes, Stephanie got more votes than D.C. listeners.  Oh, have that out.  Oh, wow.  Hold on.  Morgan, very upset.  Morgan.  Hello.  Morgan, contestant number 14 from Philly.  Oh, my God.  Stinky wrote on the screen that you sound upset.  I am.  I'm pretty mad.  I think I deserved the trip.  I was kind of hoping I was going to win.  Morgan, I got to tell you something.  You were a favorite of a lot of guys around here.  Was I your favorite? 
[02:15:30]  Absolutely.  You were Rick's favorite.  I voted for you in the preliminaries and everything.  I don't know.  I was kind of scared at first.  I didn't think I was going to make the top 20 because I know a lot of girls, like, had  taken their nighties off.  I don't know.  I kind of thought it was like a nightie contest, not a naked contest.  Ah, well, you know something?  Everything degenerates to nudity on this program.  True, true.  So if it's a naughty nightie contest, if it was a Bible study contest, it would be nude  Bible study by the end of the contest. 
[02:16:00]  It's just how it works.  All right, Morgan.  You did real well, though.  But there's a contest that we're doing soon.  Maybe you can get involved.  Yeah.  Another one.  We need to let this contest kind of fade away, and then we're coming back with something  really strong.  Oh, yeah?  Okay.  I'm ready.  And I have a feeling a lot of the girls that were in the naughty nightie contest will be  back in.  Yes.  It's the naughty ovaries contest we'll be doing, and I can't wait to take some pictures.  I want to find out, Rick.  Who has the hottest ovaries? 
[02:16:30]  Pose those ovaries, Rick.  Get a good angle.  Get a good one.  Get a good angle.  Yeah, Morgan, I don't get it either.  And you know where we're going to have to put the camera to get a good shot.  All right.  All right, Morgan.  Hey, did the anal monster beat out Morgan?  No, stop it.  No, we don't know.  Give me some votes.  Right now on opandanthony.com is the top five in the naughty nightie contest with the amount 
[02:17:00]  of votes each girl got.  Scott's working on all top 20 girls.  So, Morgan, you can find out how many votes you got in the contest.  We'll have that up soon, all right?  Okay.  Thank you.  All right, Morgan.  There she goes from Philly.  Bye, sweetie.  All right.  All right.  All right, Stephanie.  We're done with you.  And when you're in...  No, I'm just kidding.  I was just talking to Morgan.  I'm just hanging out.  All right, Stephanie.  So, we'll see you Thursday in New York City.  Yes.  All right.  Congratulations.  Thanks, guys.  Congrats.  All right, there she goes.  See you soon.  Representing Washington, D.C. 
[02:17:30]  Great job.  Thanks.  Contestant, remember Contestant 21.  She's calling all pissed off.  Yeah.  Hello?  She's a hell of a singer, though.  A little angry.  Anal monster coming knocking down city.  Anal monster.  Classic.  Wow.  A lot of people will comment.  Man, people, like, really happy, but a lot of people really pissed off that the girls 
[02:18:00]  they voted for didn't win.  All right.  We'll go to the phones next.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  She's fighting.  Put more in there.  Put more in there.  Christy is being...  Christy's fighting back.  Which means more.  More.  Oh, my God.  The tank is coming apart.  Coming soon, the return of the 55-gallon drum challenge on the Opie and Anthony Show.  And E.W.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show? 
[02:18:30]  Why bother watching the Grammys this year?  Why's that?  Clean sweep for you, too.  Oh, you think?  They're going to win it all.  They're going to win every damn award.  They could possibly win.  And that'll make me happy.  I have no idea who is even up for awards.  Why?  Who are they against?  I don't know.  You know?  See?  So it's not really saying, hey, you two's great and all.  It ain't saying much when I can't name one other band. 
[02:19:00]  All right.  We got to go right back to the phone.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Joe, what's going on?  How you doing?  Even though all my votes went to Sasha, I want to congratulate Stephanie.  But we might have two winners because I don't think you told Stephanie there's no plane tickets involved with this trip to Cancun.  She might want to call Danielle back and see if she shares that $500 second prize.  Joe, we're improving.  Unlike our Super Bowl trip, this trip comes with a flight. 
[02:19:30]  Can I give a big F to Eddie Tronk?  I think I've been requesting a song for eight weeks and he hasn't played it.  If I was Mike Piazza, he'd probably play it all night for me.  All right.  What are you requesting songs for?  I want to hear Changes by Black Sabbath.  And for eight weeks, I've been calling and requesting it and nothing.  And I'm glad to hear you guys on.  I have my radio set on to see in the hall of Pirate Radio. 
[02:20:00]  And when I turned in, I said, oh, no, these guys got fired.  But then I realized I had it on the wrong channel.  Dude, can we guess what drug you're on, please?  Me?  Me?  I got a little Xanax and a little Valium.  Yeah.  A Valium.  A little Valium.  Yeah, a little about five.  I got a Valium.  All right, Joe.  It's on the Valium.  You all right.  You like that Pirate Radio stuff?  Yeah, it's cool.  I like Regina.  Arr, we're going to play some Ozzy R, matey.  What's so cool about the Pirate Radio station you like?  I like this one girl, Regina. 
[02:20:30]  She's got a nice voice.  Yeah, and does she play, like, different stuff?  Yeah, she plays whatever.  I like, I'm into, like, the 80s metal scene.  She plays all that stuff.  Right on.  Yeah.  All right.  Go, Sasha.  Sasha.  I used to love the Pirate Radio stations.  There's not many around these days.  There was one that popped up off the coast of Long Island.  Right.  This goes way back, and they were on some weird barge or something.  Yeah, they anchored themselves out there.  And they were just outside the international water. 
[02:21:00]  Something like that, and they had a Pirate Radio station.  They got shut down.  And it was the coolest thing for the summer.  Was it?  And then they finally figured out how to shut them down, but...  Well, I think this is a legal station.  It's a college station.  Yeah, then that's not a Pirate Station.  Well, that's what they call it, Seen Hall Pirate Radio.  Oh, it's fake Pirate Radio.  Oh, where do you introduce the show?  Seen Hall Pirate, John R.A.  Oh, Seen Hall Pirate, yeah.  Oh, my God.  All right, I just figured it out.  All right.  Thank you, Joe.  All right, thank you. 
[02:21:30]  I love Sasha.  I love you, Sasha.  All right.  Don't stalk her, though, bro.  I'm in Newark, New Jersey.  I think she's in Washington, D.C.  No stalking the contestants.  Hey, you guys want to hear a ghetto fight between some girls?  Yeah.  I'm looking out the window.  They're out here arguing over kickball.  Yeah, let's hear.  Let me see.  I'm going to put the phone out the window.  All right.  Hey, bitches, start yelling.  Stop this, kid.  All right, Lou.  Yeah, well, Joe.  Yeah.  Joe, I think you're cursed.  Oh, I'm sorry. 
[02:22:00]  I'm sorry.  Well, what's going on outside your window?  Well, we got a bunch of little kids out here playing kickball.  And one girl just about like five, ten minutes ago, they were fighting, and one ripped the  shirt off the other one.  Everybody was going crazy.  All right.  How old are these girls?  These girls are like 12 or 13.  Oh, Jesus.  They got a lot of junk in the trunk, if you know what I mean.  Yeah, they're dragging this dragon in a mean wagon.  Hey, I like that dragon in a mean wagon.  All right, Joe, yell at them again.  Let's hear this.  Everyone be quiet.  Don't curse, though, this time. 
[02:22:30]  Hey, leave that little girl alone.  Hey, Mongo.  Mongo.  Slap her.  Did you hear that?  Who's Mongo?  Oh, it's this big black guy, my friend.  Yeah.  Nobody's selling his crack.  He's in the hall.  I don't want to.  Mongo, and who's the other guy?  The other guy?  No, no, he's the only one out there right now.  The other guy's inside the car.  Oh, you asked Mongo to slap her?  Yeah.  Oh, I thought slapper was another friend. 
[02:23:00]  I don't know if you've ever been to a project that's pretty loud out here.  You're in the projects where?  In Harlem?  No, in Newark.  Oh, I thought you said Harlem.  No, not Harlem.  Newark, Newark.  I thought you said Harlem.  All right.  If you need crack in Newark, find Mongo.  If you guys want after 12 o'clock, I can hear that.  I can give you gunshots all night.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, they just shoot them off.  I don't know if anybody dies, but I hear them all night.  Hey, so, Joe?  Yeah.  What went wrong in your life that you're in the middle of the ghetto in Newark? 
[02:23:30]  Well, actually, let me see.  I'm something like you.  I dropped out of high school.  Yeah.  Got hooked on heroin for a couple of years.  Nice.  Well, that's...  No, but I beat that.  I beat that.  I stopped cold turkey.  You what?  I stopped cold turkey.  Now I'm just taking couples and axes and volumes.  Just to take the edge off, volumes.  Well, no, I'm pretty cool.  I just do that for...  And how old are you, Joe?  I'm 30.  30-year-old white guy living in the ghetto of Newark. 
[02:24:00]  No, Puerto Rican.  Yeah.  Oh, look at...  Oh, wow.  Oh, sorry.  Sorry, Joe.  And how do you make a living?  Well, right now, I'm living with my mom.  Oh, wow.  I got money in the bank.  I can still get high.  Kids, stay high.  Little beastie boys.  All right, Joe.  I get it.  Hey, Joe, you called back.  We like you.  All right, man.  You got it.  All right.  All right.  There goes Joe.  Say hi to Mongo.  Mongo.  Mongo.  You get your crack from Mongo. 
[02:24:30]  John, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  I just want to say that the drum roll was longer than the whole damn contest.  Yeah.  Yeah, and John Bonet Ramsey sounds better in her coffin than that girl did singing.  Oh, oh, John.  All right.  Thank you, John.  All right.  John.  Phil, what's going on?  Hello.  Hey, Phil, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  All right.  Hey, guys, I am stupefied.  I'm sorry.  Why?  I thought Daniella should have won that contest.  Yeah, I was really into... 
[02:25:00]  Oh, I was shocked.  I was really into Anna at first, then I went with Stephanie for a while.  Actually, I started with Bobby from Philly.  Yeah.  I was really into Bobby from Philly.  Then went the way of Anna, then Stephanie, then I leaned toward Daniella at the end of  the contest.  Yeah, but was it the Gillian Anderson look that got you think?  A little bit.  That's what it probably was.  I was like, oh.  Right down to the wire, though.  How many votes did she win by?  Do you guys know?  Stephanie won by a lot.  A lot?  We're going to post all the votes for the top 20.  It's going to take a little while, but I think the top five are up on opianthony.com 
[02:25:30]  with all the votes they got.  All right, guys.  All right.  Thank you, Phil.  Bye.  A lot of people want to comment, Anthony.  Let's go to...  I was stunned that Anna didn't make the top five.  I'm very surprised.  Well, that was the strategy thing.  Oh, yeah.  Sacramento, too many hot chicks.  Too many hot chicks.  Yeah.  Someone had a fall by the wayside.  They thinned out their votes, Anthony.  They certainly did.  Let's go to Rob.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, gentlemen.  How are you doing?  I'm Rob.  I live out in Central Ridge, Long Island.  All right.  And when I was a kid, like in maybe 10th grade, 9th grade, there was a guy that put up an 
[02:26:00]  antenna in the sump in Holbrook.  And he used to have like a, you know, old metal and stuff playing.  And go ahead.  I'm sorry.  No, go ahead.  I just love those pirate radio stations when they pop up.  Yeah, it was cool.  But it was like up at like 88 on the FM dial, you know.  But the other thing I wanted to tell you guys, I went out the other day to Sports Plus.  Do you know what that is?  On Long Island?  It's like a big arcade and they got a bar upstairs.  Yeah.  Okay.  The Iron Sheik was there. 
[02:26:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, boy.  He was there and he's a mess.  Well, he can't walk because his legs are all curled and stuff.  And he was like in some sort of wrestling match.  And then he was at the bar rubbing cigarettes and drinks off of people and signing autographs  of pictures of him with Steve, Stone Cold Steve Austin for five bucks a piece.  Oh, the poor guy.  And he was, I remember him, I think he was the big battle royale at the last Wrestlemania  and he won the whole thing and he couldn't even move or walk. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah, he looked horrible.  He walked up to the stage because they had a band.  Yeah.  And he went up to talk on the microphone.  I swear to God, I didn't think he was going to make it up there.  And then when he gave his feet, nobody understood what the hell he was saying anyway.  We're trying to get him on the show.  The last time we tried, he got stopped at the Rochester airport.  Rochester airport.  They wouldn't let him on the plane.  Because he wouldn't take his shoes off because he had those curly fry type shoes.  He didn't have them on this time.  Where they're laced all the way up to his knee practically and he didn't want to take  the shoes off so they wouldn't let him on the plane.  How's that supposed to be sexy? 
[02:27:30]  He missed his flight and we didn't get him on the show because of that.  So we'll try again.  Yeah.  He was at the bar and he had this really nerdy Jewish looking manager.  Right.  And all of a sudden, the manager's talking to him.  Everything's nice and nice.  And all of a sudden, he turns to the manager.  He's like, you want to go?  Get out of here.  Go to get out of here.  He goes, I'm staying here.  These are my fans.  Get out of here.  Oh, boy.  He threw the guy out of the bar.  Requiem for a heavyweight.  All right, Rob.  Thanks for the story.  We'll get him on, hopefully.  All right.  Take care, guys. 
[02:28:00]  All right, man.  Bye.  Let's go to D.C. and talk to James.  James, what's up, bro?  How you doing, man?  How you doing?  Hey, I just saw Hulk Hogan at McDonald's, man.  He was getting happy meals for everybody.  But that's another story.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Man, what is in the water today?  Hey.  Hold on.  James, there's no way Hulk Hogan is in Washington, D.C. right now.  So, maybe it wasn't him.  They're taping, I guess, SmackDown or the next, I guess it has to be SmackDown in Boston tonight. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah.  Maybe it wasn't him.  I'm sorry.  All right.  Go ahead.  Hey, how is it with our 10 listeners we mustered up the prettiest woman out of your 18th city?  What's up with all these other pucks in these cities?  You know, because I think the listeners listened to us and they just voted for the hottest girl.  And they have said that Stephanie is the hottest girl in the Naughty Nighty contest.  She won, if you're just tuning in.  So, what does that say about D.C. is what I'm saying?  We saw life. 
[02:29:00]  We saw some life.  Some life.  Yeah.  We saw it.  We're kicking butt.  Hey, I got a Norton impression.  Go ahead.  www.smudge-proof.com.  Oh, look at you.  You didn't even get the last W in.  Very good.  www.  All right.  Let's go to Bill.  Bill, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Oh, we got to get this.  Bring him in.  Bring him in.  Hey, Bill.  Yeah.  As I was going to say, I was slightly disappointed with the votes.  I had DeVita in the fourth to place. 
[02:29:30]  Oh, Jesus.  All right.  Enough about that.  I'll see you guys later.  And you say, we beat a joke into the ground.  All right.  All right.  Well, Sarah has to go back to Cleveland, Anthony.  Oh, you're heading back, huh?  Yeah.  Well, what is it?  A week from Friday?  I'm sorry?  You're going to come back for the 55-gallon drum challenge?  I am.  Sarah came and...  It's not like she goes to school or nothing.  And she ate the lamb brain right out of the skull. 
[02:30:00]  Lamb brains.  Three heaping scoops.  Scooped it out with a spoon and now she has qualified for the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Did you have fun in New York?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  My first time here.  You got the gas money and everything?  Yeah.  You're going to try to make some time with her on the way home?  Long ride home?  Yeah.  Rick made arrangements for us to get in a hotel afterwards.  Oh, really?  Nice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No.  Is your boyfriend listening to this?  No.  No?  No.  The crappy Cleveland station doesn't even come in.  Oh.  Cleveland station doesn't come in where you are? 
[02:30:30]  Oh, that's good.  Then how did you find out about this?  Oh, you're a buddy.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Well, we're going to see you in about a week.  Have a good trip back to Cleveland.  Thank you.  Thank you for everything, guys.  Yeah, thank you.  And to get back into high school, huh?  I am.  Oh, so overrated.  All right.  There they go.  All right.  Well, thanks, you guys.  Thanks, Sarah.  Thank you.  All right.  There they go.  Best meeting you guys.  Thank you.  I can't read her.  I don't know if she's happy, sad, betadded.  I'm kidding. 
[02:31:00]  It's a little joke.  Hey, Will, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  I'm really effing pissed off about all this.  And I'm from Cleveland, and I wanted so bad for a Cleveland chick to win.  But, God damn, that Stephanie, half your listeners must be faggots, because I'm telling you,  Daniela was so hot.  Why in the F wouldn't they freaking vote for her? 
[02:31:30]  I don't understand that crap.  You know why?  Because, like we said earlier, there is Sacramento really effed up in this contest by throwing  a ton of hot girls at us.  Yeah.  Because you've got to think part of the vote is going to come from the, you know, from  the locals in that city voting for their hometown girls.  But in Sacramento, they had to split their votes between four hot girls.  Yeah, but Daniela was just beyond hot.  She was, like, alien hot, dude.  She was so gorgeous. 
[02:32:00]  It was like, I can't believe that.  See how passionate these guys are with some of these girls.  It's okay.  We didn't have to execute her because she lost.  Yeah.  I know.  She's still alive and well, and she dances every Wednesday and Friday at that strip club  in Sacramento.  Damn, I'm telling you, my computer screen's a mess.  See the way he's talking about her?  Yeah.  There were guys talking about girls that just, there was no goddamn business for them saying  that about that girl.  Like, dude, man, number, and then whatever. 
[02:32:30]  And then I punch it up and go, oh, my God, was this guy blind?  But, no, Daniela was very hot, and she's happy with second place.  Oh, all right, guys.  Thanks.  I'm going to go listen to myself.  You guys suck.  Thank you.  Thank you, my tool friend.  Let's go to Jesse.  Jesse, what's up?  Yeah, I just wanted to know, you know how you told that dude from Newark to call back?  Yeah.  What do you think the chances are after that dude, Mongo, finds out that he told everybody  he's so cracked that the dude's actually going to be able to call back? 
[02:33:00]  Yeah, the guy just ratted Mongo out to 18 cities.  I'm hanging up.  That's funny, Jesse.  Very nice, yeah.  Dude?  Sean, what's going on?  Hey, you tools.  Hey, Sean.  I want to know, now that you know that we have the highest percentage of hot women in  Sacramento, why don't you guys bring a show out here?  Oh, well, that's way over there.  Yeah, we'll get to that.  Where is that?  Somewhere near Chicago?  Or at least could have set a tape delay. 
[02:33:30]  I think they're setting something up for the summer in Sacramento for us, so we'll have  details when we figure it out.  Great.  All right, Sean.  You guys suck.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Whew.  My God.  People get so touchy about these contests.  More Iron Sheik stories coming in, Anthony.  I love you.  Bob, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, my radio buddies?  Hey, Bob.  Listen, I got an Iron Sheik story.  Back in 1992, me and my wife went down for a honeymoon to St. Martin down in the Indies, 
[02:34:00]  West Indies.  And on the way back, I saw him on the plane.  The guy's got a head.  Jesus Christ.  I've never seen a head so big and big.  I never saw such a big head.  My own.  Look at the size of your head.  It's like a midget head.  Anyway, people were starting to bother him.  I guess he was up in first class and they were breaking his chops.  So he moved back to where I was and I snuck a little, you know, those airplane bottles  of vodka. 
[02:34:30]  I slipped one through the seat to him.  He accepted it.  And I asked him, hey, how did you manage to get away with cowboy Bob Thornton back in  Arizona?  He had a problem back there.  Snort, snort, you know?  And at first, it looked like he was going to rip my head off and kill me.  But after that, he was cool about it.  He asked me if I had another drink.  I pulled out a bottle of that overproof rum that they got down there.  When you're telling these little stories, here's a good idea.  Have a point.  It makes it so much more interesting.  Come on, listener. 
[02:35:00]  Torture!  That's torture!  Jesus, man.  The guy started out strong, too.  It's so horrible when they crash and burn like that.  Dean, what's going on?  Hey, man.  I just seen Rowdy Ryder Piper.  Rowdy Ryder Piper at the taco bell.  Man, you should check him out.  He's handing out tacos to everybody.  He's playing tacos for everyone.  It's incredible. 
[02:35:30]  I know.  I gave him a bottle of rum.  Very good.  Thank you, Dean.  He's funny.  All right.  So then, like, I heard the landing gear come down, right?  Right.  And I said to the Sheik, look, the gear are down.  All right.  Great.  All right.  Tomorrow's the big day as a girl comes in and gets super soaked.  This is going to be so much fun.  We already have the blood in the fridge.  A huge gallon jug of lamb blood. 
[02:36:00]  And there's no distinguishing lamb blood from human blood.  No.  It really, we opened it up and looked, and it just looks like a murder took place.  And we're going to put this in a super soaker, pump them up, and shoot this girl with super  soaker full of blood.  She's going to look like a murder victim when we're done.  It's going to be great.  And she'll be in brawn panties for this.  Steve, see, already camouflaging the green room.  So nobody knows where this was done.  That's right.  For some reason, Jeremy's all paranoid about that. 
[02:36:30]  And then we have another girl coming down to, well, she was going to drink pig's blood,  but we have to boil it, so she'll be eating.  We found out when you boil it, it coagulates and turns into this pudding-like thing.  You should dump it from a bucket from overhead.  You should dump it from a bucket overhead and have a carry moment.  Stop it.  They'll all laugh at you.  You know, we wanted to do that in Philly.  Wanted to do it to Stalker Patty.  Stalker Patty.  What happened?  Now that we know we can get the blood like that.  I decided to come out in a Superman suit and stood. 
[02:37:00]  Good.  Disgusting hammer-toed mess.  All right.  Hey, I've got to read an instant feedback here, Ant.  Maybe someone out there has some info on this.  Oh, now I've got to find it.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Okay.  You were speaking of gym class earlier?  Yeah.  Bo from Cleveland writes,  Oh, and hey, speaking of gym class, did he catch Real Sports on HBO last night?  They did a whole story about how there is a movement across the country to ban dodgeball.  Ban dodgeball.  And all other forms of competitive activities because kids will feel bad if they don't win. 
[02:37:30]  Oh.  They even had a gym teacher who taught jumping rope but without the jump rope because then the kids will feel that they were more successful at it.  Well, if you jump rope without a jump rope, that way you can't trip over it.  And no one can make fun of you going, ah, you can't even jump rope.  That's smart.  So you take away the jump rope.  Play rope.  That's smart.  That's great.  I like the dodgeball.  That was fun.  Make sure the kids have no competitive edge when they go into the real world. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah, they'll do fine.  What was you trying?  That's why they're picking up weapons and shooting each other.  You need some good old-fashioned competition.  You need to pick up that red dodgeball and wail it into some nerd's face.  Ping.  Boom.  Boom.  That thing almost rang, didn't it?  When it hit.  Boom.  Right off your forehead.  You're like, oh, damn, that was close.  So you turn around and go, oh, now I can't turn back around.  Right.  Like, you're cowering with your back to the fire. 
[02:38:30]  And then the second you turn around, what do you see?  Voight.  You see the Voight sign an inch away from your face.  Boom.  Ah.  You ever see one of the multiple balls going back and forth?  Oh, yeah.  And some guy gets nailed, like, two times simultaneously.  It's just like a split-second pause, like, boom, boom.  Two of those big, huge, red welts on them that are about five inches in diameter.  Five inches across.  There was a sadistic bastard gym teacher.  We had Gil Lilienthal. 
[02:39:00]  Giblets.  Giblets in John Glenn High School.  And he would go, all right, everyone, down to the boiler room.  He put mats on the walls of the boiler room downstairs.  We didn't even have gym in the gymnasium.  This guy was the sickest bastard.  And he'd play.  It wasn't even called dodgeball.  He called it something else ball.  It was like assault ball or attack ball.  It was like kill ball or something.  Kill ball 2000.  Yeah.  You'd go downstairs into the boiler room. 
[02:39:30]  And he'd split it up into teams.  And you'd play with this little ball.  When you got hit with it, it hurt.  And you had to play on your knees.  What a sick F.  In the boiler room.  It looked like a scene out of Oz.  And the team were always fair.  They had like a thousand jock wrestlers on one side.  Oh, yeah.  That's what he'd do, too.  Me and Anth on the other side.  Yeah, yeah.  It was.  It was absolutely that.  He'd have his jocks on one side.  All right.  I'm going to split up the teams.  Boom, boom, boom. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah.  And it ends up like a scene out of Oz.  I got shanked in the boiler room at John Glenn.  And it was sick because you'd be on your knees.  And if you moved your head to get away from the dodgeball, you hit a big steam pipe.  Like, there's pipes down there.  I don't know how this guy got away with the abuse he used to dole out on a daily basis for as long as he did.  You remember when somebody missed enough gym classes?  He would, like, give you a choice of either running the track, like, all period, or punching you in the chest. 
[02:40:30]  Or punching you in the chest.  He did the same thing with smoking.  If he caught you smoking, he'd go, okay, you got a choice.  What a sick F.  I could take you down to the office and say, I caught you smoking, run you through the system, he'd say.  The system, like it's a goddamn city he's running there.  He's the sheriff, new sheriff in town.  Or he'd go, you stand there, I will punch you in the chest.  And a lot of people that were afraid to get in trouble opted for the punch in the chest.  And they'd sit there, and you would fly.  Like, your chest would cave in, and you'd look like you were in a sitting position, only you'd be in midair with your hands straight out in front of you. 
[02:41:00]  Cartoon style.  Absolutely.  Isn't that how Houdini died?  Huh?  Isn't that how Houdini died?  Yeah, with the punch in the gut.  Well, the Oriental kid, I remember saying, straightened his eyes out.  I swear to God, man.  I didn't take a punch.  That's the only thing I ever saw.  He was huge, too, Lillian Ball.  Huge guy.  Used to play for the Broncos before he got injured.  And then nothing more bitter than a professional football player getting injured and having to teach snot-nose, could-give-a-crap high school students' gym class. 
[02:41:30]  So it wasn't like he was bitter or anything, that he gained 600 pounds and had a beat-up on children to make himself feel better.  That's wild.  It was fun.  Kurt, what's up?  Yeah, how's it going?  Listen, I have no idea how this chick won.  Stephanie, Stephanie, you look like number 20 of the two of my life.  Sorry, sorry, sorry.  Hey, hey, hey.  Hold on there.  Hold on.  It must be some block of people that are sitting outside, like White Castle in the middle of the day with nothing to do, just, I don't know, got a hold of a computer or something, because I'm just... 
[02:42:00]  We got some techies on the job, and they're saying it's legit.  Stephanie, number 37, won the Naughty Nighty contest, announced about an hour ago.  You got, like, ten times more winners than you have listeners in that town.  Well, she won the whole damn thing.  Oh, all right.  Did you see the Z-Mark part she's got in her head?  It looked like Jim Norton got a hold of a thresher and knocked her unconscious with it. 
[02:42:30]  All right, Kurt.  Thank you.  You know why we didn't read that on Instant Feedback?  Because it wasn't that funny?  Right.  I'm punching out Maverick.  All right.  Stephanie is coming to New York, and we're going to have some beers with the listeners with Stephanie later on this week.  I have two words.  Anna.  Whatever the hell.  No doubt.  I know.  What happened to her?  She didn't make the top 20?  No, she was in the top 20.  Oh, was she?  Yeah.  Aaron, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  She's got their instant message up there, and she has the auto-reply message set, and it 
[02:43:00]  says, when you click on her name, I love you all.  Thanks to each and every one of you for the vote.  I'm going to have my own site by Thursday.  Super Naughty website.  So you just promoted the porn star.  Wow, she's already promoting herself as the winner of the Naughty Nighty Contest.  What's her screen name?  V-A space V-1-X-E-N.  V-A Vixen with a one and seven I.  I got you.  All right.  And you get that response.  Cole?  Yo, guys, one other thing.  Yeah.  There's some guy who hacked into your instant messaging thing and started talking to me. 
[02:43:30]  He started asking me questions.  What?  Some guy hacked into your instant messaging thing, and he sees them as you see them, and  he sent me an email asking me what her screen name was before, as soon as the IM to you guys.  I have no idea what you're saying.  I think your phone's crapping out.  Oh, is it?  Yeah.  No, I'm telling you, if you put Ben or Rick on the phone, I'll...  There's a hacker.  I don't think that was his phone.  That was his brain open.  That was Jeremy Coleman with another conspiracy theory.  We got a hacker.  A hacker.  Rock and roll Johnny Race. 
[02:44:00]  Uh-oh.  Rock and roll, boys.  Rock and roll.  Rock and roll.  He's got his touch right.  Rock and roll.  Rock and roll, brother, love.  I just learned today that my mother-in-law could almost get a record contract.  That was classic.  You guys.  Hey, man.  That mix with Ro was unbelievable, and I got a punch out, Maverick.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Silent game with Johnny Race. 
[02:44:30]  Okay, terrific.  Anthony, we got to take a break, and then we're going to play What Do We Learned on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Very educational.  But really fast, I've just been handed a note.  Tomorrow, we could do this on the show tomorrow?  Yeah, he's going skiing.  Earl, go skiing for the first time tomorrow on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  This is going to be great.  Earl, what the F is this about?  Grab that mic real fast.  Our good friends at Budweiser thought it would be a good idea if I hosted a day of skiing. 
[02:45:00]  What the hell is...  What?  Because we all know skiing is a black man's sport.  Yeah, it's kind of really not...  Yeah, they're sending me up to Mountain Creek, and I think it's Vernon, New Jersey.  Oh, that's what they told you.  This is from the bright mind of Lisa Orban.  Are you going to be on skis tomorrow?  Possibly, yeah.  Earl on skis.  Are you going to be in all black?  Yeah, are you?  Yes, I am.  You're going to wear all black on the mountain.  Pure white mountain, a little black spot coming down the mountain. 
[02:45:30]  Earl will be on the black trail.  You know what's strange, though?  A black diamond.  Earl going down a black diamond, even on skis, he would go really slow.  Could you just imagine him?  It's like, Earl, where are you?  What's taking you so long?  I don't know.  You're just skiing.  Go F yourself.  So you'll be checking in from the mountain tomorrow?  Yeah, first thing tomorrow.  Mountain Creek in New Jersey.  A black girl from the future here, I break my leg, I go ass over tea kettle, down the mountain. 
[02:46:00]  I saw that happen.  I was in a cast for six to eight weeks.  As a matter of fact, when I was totally incapacitated, I got more done at work than I do when I'm healthy.  Are you going to try the dinner roll tomorrow?  You're going to do the dinner roll, that little move there, freestyle?  I call myself Peek-a-boo Earl.  That's me, Peek-a-boo Earl.  Budweiser, the king of beaters.  I'm Susie Earlstick.  A little skiing. 
[02:46:30]  All right, Earl.  You've never skied in your life?  No.  Somehow, it doesn't surprise me.  What about the weak ankle theory?  Yeah, you know something?  I've heard that stereotype say the black man has the weak ankles.  And, you know, ankles are very important for skiing.  We'll find out tomorrow.  What happens is, you know, they didn't breed it for the strong ankles.  So what happens when a black man skis, they tend to fall down a lot.  Is this on?  Oh, no.  Hello?  Ding dong. 
[02:47:00]  Hello?  Who's in here?  Hello?  Earl is skiing.  Tomorrow.  That's great.  Too many jokes.  I can't wait to get...  Now, you're going to be calling us, right?  Yeah, first thing, straight up 3 o'clock.  That's great.  God, who's not tuning in?  Yeah, all we're going to hear, he'll be calling, we'll hear,  Whoa!  Lord, damn it!  Whoa!  I brought back some clips of me from the future tomorrow. 
[02:47:30]  Here's me going down the bunny trail.  Help me!  Help me!  Help me!  Somebody help me!  Help me!  Help me!  I don't like it.  That's kind of...  Here's me when I fell down.  Ouch!  I'm seeing if we have any audio of Earl over here.  Let me see.  And here's the ski instructor when the Asian gentleman with me fell down. 
[02:48:00]  Stock that chink a day's pay for napping on the job.  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir, Mr. Taggit.  Here's Earl looking for skis, Anthony.  All right.  No, my brother.  You got my own.  Earl finally gets fed up and gives his skis to one of the young people there.  And somebody asked where they got the skis.  I got it from a Negro.  Ah.  Really?  Well, Earl fell down there. 
[02:48:30]  And here's Earl talking to a female ski instructor.  Ooh, who are you?  I ain't calling you, lady.  Wow, he sounds a little out of it.  Well, yeah.  Why did that happen?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  Have fun, Earl.  Thank you, Budweiser.  Next.  What did you learn today?  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:49:00]  Hey, we had fun today, huh?  Oh, yeah.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  We announced the winner of the Naughty Nighty Contest.  That's what I learned today.  Who won the damn thing?  It's Stephanie from Washington, D.C., contestant number 37.  She's going to be in New York later on this week, and we're going out with our listeners with Stephanie.  So you can see her in the flesh.  Uh, Daniela came in second, and, uh, Lisa from Boston came in third.  You can see the top five on, uh, opieandanthony.com. 
[02:49:30]  Maybe I should just take Anna out.  Anna?  Yeah, you guys are taking the winners out.  First of all, she's in Sacramento.  Click.  That's what you'd hear.  Click.  She's in Sacramento, and, um, she's too hot.  You'll be able to find out what place your girl came in.  Scott's working on that.  It's going to be up later on tonight, and you'll see how many votes all, all the, uh, top 20 got.  So the difference between first and second place is over 10,000 votes. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah.  That's, uh, sick.  See what some cans will get you?  She took her shirt off quite a few times during that photo shoot, and that seems to, uh, be able to put her over the top.  Go to opieandanthony.com for the results.  Also, you can see the pictures of Sarah from Cleveland eating the lamb brain today right from the skull.  A lot of that stuff will be up on foundrymusic.com as well, all right?  I learned those guys from Budweiser are funny mother effers.  Send an Earl Skeen.  And Black Earl from the future learned that, uh, if there's an avalanche, at least they'll be able to find me. 
[02:50:30]  Go eff yourself.  Going to shred it up?  You think you're going to, uh, do some snowboarding?  No.  Americans, uh, got three medals in that one.  All those, they swept it.  You talked me out of it.  Ben talked me out of it.  Yeah, I don't think Earl wants his feet confined like that.  Oh, God.  Oh, I wasn't even going to go there. 
[02:51:00]  Oh.  At least with skis, he can move around a little bit.  Oh, God damn.  That's awful.  Two boogies laughing, so I think I'm okay.  All right.  Hey, it's a nice resort, is it?  It's a nice place.  I hope so.  Thank God I got my line in, eh, and I almost missed out today.  I know some ski places, because ski, you got to admit, skiing is a predominantly white sport.  Yeah.  And some of the, some of the ski places don't want, you know, a lot of black people coming 
[02:51:30]  there.  And I know, one, that as the ski lift came around and the black guy got ready to get  on, it was just a noose that came around from the chair.  Waterdoodle.  Waterdoodle, apologize.  Bone dry.  No wonder they hang nooses from ski lifts.  What?  Hello?  Hello?  Ding dong.  Hello?  Is this on there?  Who's in here?  Waterdoodle.  That's the tow rope.  Bone dry. 
[02:52:00]  Snarlins.  Time for a bone dry and the unemployment line waterdoodle.  Tomorrow on the show, super soakers filled with blood.  I'm psyched.  As we spray a girl in her bra and panties.  That's going to look great.  That's going to rock.  You want to get a right at, like, that spot, first thing, so it looks like you've got to  go to the bathroom.  We could have a little friendly wager between you and I.  A little target practice.  Yeah, why not?  It's time to play What Do We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Al Mack from Clifton.  Today I learned that the green room is becoming the Batcave.  Today I learned that Lisa came in. 
[02:52:30]  Click.  Fresca's Ghost checking in from Huntington, Anthony.  I learned Steve C. is the new maintenance man at WNEW.  And camouflage makes lewd and crude acts all better.  Gooberts from Huntington.  A lot of people checking in from the old town.  I'm not here.  I learned today you can get crack from Mongo.  Where was that?  What part of Jersey?  Newark.  In Newark.  Look for Mongo. 
[02:53:00]  Get your crack.  Stones fan.  From New Hampshire.  I learned today old wrestlers never die.  They just buy fast food for people.  And Anthony's gym class credits look like the deficit clock.  Took a lot of gym there, Ant, huh?  Kudos to Plankford on that.  I just heard Lisa from the sales staff is trying to get Mongo as a sponsor of the show.  Is that true?  Come on.  I will suck your...  How much for one ramp? 
[02:53:30]  Oh, my God.  Hey, Mike.  What's up?  What's up, Don?  Hey.  Hey.  Yeah.  I learned that Anthony was on his knees in the boiler room with other boys.  Well, we learned that today.  Sure.  Fig.  No matter how much I scream, just push hard until you see blood.  Jesus.  Chris, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Today I learned, hope you left the seat up. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah.  Great move.  Skiing is now going to be a black man's sport.  Hey, and if this radio thing doesn't work out, Anthony's qualified to work in the parking garage.  There you go.  I've been trained.  Later, guys.  Thank you, Chris.  Yeah, Uncle John's always good for one.  Uncle John, what did you learn on the show today?  Hey, guys.  I learned that Earl was going to be a black speck on a white mountain. 
[02:54:30]  Jesus.  Later.  I can't wait to hear that now, tomorrow.  He's not even going to attempt skiing.  You don't think he's going to try it?  Let's stop teasing this.  He'll try it.  Three o'clock, I will make a wager he doesn't even put the skis on.  Really?  No way.  Is Earl skiing tomorrow?  I want to hear him swishing down the mountainside.  I'll be swishing.  Shushing.  Shushing.  Shushing.  All right, really fast.  Big Mike from Philly learned every contest on the O&A show.  Eventually involves bare skin.  And Jersey Bob, I learned that if you're going to ask third-place contestants any questions, 
[02:55:00]  you have to do it before they know they're in third place.  We've got to get out of here.  Tomorrow's going to be a great show.  Thanks, everyone.  Go see Brother Joe at Bar 9 tonight.  Bar 9.  Between 5th and 54th tonight.  Thank you.  Bar 9.  9th Avenue, isn't it?  Yeah, it's on 9th.  Between 5th and 54th.  Bar 9.  Bar 9 tonight.  Nice.  With Brother Joe and a bunch of the people that you know and love from the show.  And Jim Land.  And Jim, yeah.  My buddy Jim.  Jim's going to be there, too.  Jim will be singing.  Fine vocalist, I might ask.  Yes, he is.  Also, really fast, thanks to Drew Boogie for adding some rhythm to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:55:30]  Great job, Drew.  We'll leave with one of his pieces, and we'll see you guys tomorrow.  I am a big fan of Drew.  Yes.  Are you ready?  Here they come.  Opie and Anthony.  How you guys doing?  I am down.  Yay.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Smoke weed every day.  Oh.  Thank you.  Yeah, yeah.  Smoke weed every day.  It's my time.  Oh. 
[02:56:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Would you shut the F up?  Huh?  What's up doing?  No, no, no, you imbecile.  Oh.  Wow, I thought you were a girl.  You're an ass.  What the hell were you thinking?  How you gotta do it?  You stink.  How you gotta do it?  We suck.  How you gotta do it?  Shut up, stupid.  Doc, doc, doc, doc, doc, die.  No shit done, you can carry the mail.  New wind and thunder, snowed hay.  Had no dogs, they had no slits.  But what thought drove them straight ahead? 
[02:56:30]  Go, man, go.  Be mushing as to mow.  So go, man.  Go, man.  Go, man.  No.  I say, Opie, what did you learn?  I say, Opie, what did you learn? </pre>
