<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show started chaotically, with Opie and Anthony, alongside Norton, complaining about their lateness due to traffic and rain.  The conversation quickly shifted to their newly received Sony PSPs and the immediate need to charge them, sparking a humorous rant from Opie about the lack of power outlets on the Long Island Railroad.  This led to a gripe about his Blackberry and the deluge of irrelevant work emails.  The discussion broadened to corporate surveillance and anxieties surrounding company-provided electronics. A caller, Joe, chimed in about the PSP battery issue.  This transitioned into a discussion of a controversial human body exhibit, touching upon its ethical implications.  A missing PSP was discovered on Ben's desk, leading to a debate on how to fairly distribute the remaining two, generating absurd suggestions for a competition: arm wrestling, a staple gun challenge, a water-drinking contest (with warnings about water intoxication), and finally, applying Icy Hot to the testicles.  An intern, Bill, was chosen as a test subject for the Icy Hot challenge.  The segment was rife with off-color jokes and sexual innuendo.

The Icy Hot experiment continued, with Bill applying Icy Hot to his genitals, followed by a discussion of the resulting burn.  The proposed Icy Hot contest, with PSPs as prizes, was further elaborated on.  A caller shared a story of Icy Hot causing temporary erectile dysfunction.  Simultaneously, a heated debate ensued regarding Boston's renaming of a Christmas tree to a "holiday tree," with the hosts expressing anger at political correctness. Callers offered differing opinions, some agreeing with the hosts' stance, others highlighting the use of taxpayer money for religious displays.  A disruptive homeless person outside the studio frequently interrupted. The Wright brothers and airplanes were briefly, nonsensically discussed, interspersed with the Icy Hot and "holiday tree" discussions.  The segment ended with preparations for the Icy Hot contest.  The human body exhibit was mentioned again.

The Icy Hot contest commenced, with Hawk, Travis, Eric, and Danny participating.  Travis quickly withdrew.  The hosts encouraged the remaining contestants to endure the pain through squats and jumping jacks, applying more Icy Hot and water.  Participants described intense burning and tingling, with graphic details of their suffering.  The hosts suggested further methods to increase the pain, with discussions of potential cheating.  The contest ended without a clear winner, punctuated by expletives and crude humor.

A wedgie contest ensued, with Eric, Nathaniel, and Danny (Travis having already quit) competing for PSPs. Steve administered the wedgies; Eric's underwear tore.  Thane also received a wedgie.  The hosts discussed the pain and cleaning up the mess.  A phone call with Bill Burr and Peter Iwers (In Flames) followed, promoting a benefit for a beaten special needs child.  This was followed by an interview with Raymond, an Amish comedian, who discussed leaving the Amish community and his career.  Dave (Wolf), a homeless Sioux Indian, interacted with the hosts and guests, discussing his life on the streets, alcoholism, and family.  He performed a Sioux chant and received money. A "homeless shopping spree" was mentioned.  Various callers participated throughout the segment.

The final segment included an interview with In Excess, a band promoting their new lead singer chosen from a VH1 show.  Their publicist was reportedly upset about the show's lateness.  Raymond (the Amish comedian) was present, bringing whoopie pies.  Keith "the Cop," a homeless individual, also appeared concerning the "homeless shopping spree." The interview discussed the VH1 show's premise, the band's decision to retain their name, their experiences, and their upcoming tour and album release (November 29th). The conversation included crude, sexually suggestive comments, misogynistic remarks, and tangents about a "sex with animals" farm and aggressive airport security.  A caller from Australia called in.  The segment ended with a performance of "Pretty Vegas."

Don't you smoke  crack. You need to shut the fuck up.  Opie! Anthony! And Norton, too! Good times, great hits! XF-202! Stuck my fucking cock! 
[00:06:00]  Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Let's do it!  All right, let's do it. This is the Opie and Anthony program for this fine Two for Tuesday.  Oh, wait. Oh, sorry. That was, what, six years ago or so now? 
[00:06:30]  Yeah. Two for Kenny Wayne Shepard. Did we do a two for from Kenny Wayne Shepard once?  I'm sure we did. Playing all the music that no other radio station in New York will play.  Yeah, that was a brilliant idea. Bravo to you, Gary. Good old Gary Wall. Yeah. Well, if it  wasn't for him, we wouldn't be here. At XM Satellite Radio. That's right. The ONA virus spreading 
[00:07:00]  across America. Thank you, XM. Thank you. Where do we begin today? Oh, Christ. What, what,  what, what, what? Uh, just, uh, uh, trying to get in this morning. I was late. Uh, we were  all late. Expressway traffic. Stupid rain. And last night I was just toiling with my, uh, my  little PSP, my Sony PSP. Yeah, we got some PSPs that arrived at, uh, the station here. 
[00:07:30]  Yes. The, the broadcast center, the Opie and Anthony broadcast center. The rich get richer.  High and top the world. It's like a couple of guys that could, you know, we could afford  to go out and purchase those. Yeah. And, uh, you know, for, uh, uh, to be nice, we, you  gotta get them, uh, for free. I don't care how much money you make. It's always fun to get  something for free. Free toys. Free toys, always more gooder. That's right. I brought 
[00:08:00]  my PSP, uh, home to Long Island yesterday. Stupid Sony. Hey, but they gave you a freak.  Stupid Sony. Sony rules. Let me tell you, I had an hour and a half train ride to Long  Island, right? Had to pick up on the restaurant that we're opening up in Huntington. Oh.  Getting very close. Cracking the whip, are you? If the goddamn floor guy, uh, came last  night like he told us he would, we would, uh, we were going to open up, uh, tomorrow  night. Wow. Because it's a big bar night. Yes, it is. Oh, everything else is not ready,  but we said, fuck it. Let's just open up the place and get some cash flowing. Open 
[00:08:30]  the bar. But stupid floor guy blew us off. Yeah, it's always the way. It's instruction  people. So now I think the restaurant is going to open up in early, uh, December. We're  going to have a big opening night, inviting all the listeners out there. Ooh. You have  an invite, Anthony. I will show up to, uh, uh, make an appearance, of course. I hope  you do. It'll be great. Absolutely. Restaurants in Huntington on, uh, 110. No, you can't  come. No, no. I'm sorry, you can't come. No, this, this is a classy joint, Jimmy. When 
[00:09:00]  is it? See, that's the confusion that's going to be out there. It's a classy joint. Mm-hmm.  So we're looking for our, uh, classier listeners to show up. Right. Class. No, you're  all invited. I don't give a fuck. We want jackets. Did you do with one listener? Yeah, right.  One guy with a fucking, like, a piano tie. Jackets required. One guy with a smoking  jacket in it and I. Right. Getting all creeped out. Sitting with him. Yeah, but the restaurant's  going to open up in, uh, Huntington on Long Island there. Pretty much. I'm forward to it. 
[00:09:30]  Pretty much in town, so. Anyway, uh, I, I jumped on the train with my brand new PSP and a new  game, uh, a new game called, uh, Infected. Yes, Infected. A gaming company thinks it's a great  tie-in because we like to call this show a virus. Yeah. The only virus. Mm-hmm.  Because there's something about this show. It gets under your skin and just kind of festers  there. Itches. And before you know it, you're kind of hooked. Yeah, it's like a virus and  then you could spread it to other people. That's right. Like the bird flu. So I'm like,  all right, I got the PSP. I got, uh, a new game called Infected. I also got the Grand Theft 
[00:10:00]  Auto Game in my book bag. Yep. And a long train ride. Perfect situation to be doing a  little gaming, right? Sure. So I open up my PSP. I put the whole thing together, which  is obviously very easy. Mm-hmm. I throw the battery pack in. Boom. Push power. No power.  Uh, now let me tell you something. When I got the Nintendo DS and did the exact same thing  with the battery, power. Why do they make you fucking charge the battery right out of 
[00:10:30]  the box? It's very rare. It's so stupid. Just charge the fucking battery. Yeah. How  tough could that be? Uh, pretty tough, I guess. Get some stupid, poor Asian kids from a third  world and charge our goddamn batteries. Their whole day is just... We're Americans, goddammit.  Popping batteries into chargers. Yes! Their little chafed fingers all day, just trying  to pop them in and pop them out. That's why we're in this great country.  Charge our batteries. Mm-hmm. So I'm like, you gotta be kidding me. No plugs on the 
[00:11:00]  train? So I had... On the Long Island Railroad? They haven't gotten that yet? I haven't been  on the Long Island Railroad. Poof. When was the last time you were on the Long Island Railroad?  They didn't have them double-decker trains. So what? 15 years? 12 years? Yeah. 12 years,  let's say? Probably 12 years. Pretty much the same trains. Really? They got a couple new  ones here and there. Same exact fucking trains. No plugs. No. Still don't have flying cars. Still  don't have a lot of brand new trains going out to Long Island. Unbelievable. We have  a few, I know, because people are going to call up. But no, most of the fleet is still 
[00:11:30]  fucking old and smelly and stupid. It plugs in. And then you got the conductors yelling  at you because you have your feet up on another chair. Oh, god. Wow. That's really going to  make a huge difference with this shithole. This shithole on wheels. So no battery. So you  couldn't use your PSP. So I had to read stupid magazines and check my... Reading?  Ugh. And then I had to check my Crackberry a million times to get the hour and a half  over with. You're addicted to the Crackberry, by the way. I'm trying not to. I got reprimanded 
[00:12:00]  by one of the staff, one of the higher-ups here for not using my Blackberry. Excuse me,  we don't have higher-ups here. That's why I didn't say boss. One of the people that are above  the people we hired for our show. Let's put it that way. They're above Derek. Barely.  Well, they got you a Blackberry and you decided not to use it. Why? I didn't even decide not  to use it. I have absolutely no use for that thing. I get my email on my phone. I get video 
[00:12:30]  on my phone. I get web access on my phone. So I really got no use for another piece of electronic  equipment. So you should repack it? Loitering on my person. Repack is you give it to someone  else this holiday season. So they can get the XM friggin' mail? Yeah. That was the thing  that put me over the edge, too. I cannot take sorting through 40 emails every hour. And that's  not an exaggeration. 40, 50 emails every hour come in from XM. It's like every XM, every person 
[00:13:00]  that emails somebody at XM, it goes to everybody. So you sit there and go, all right, I'm going  to just scroll through this shit and try to find if one is to me. No. Sorry. Use my regular  email address. People go, I emailed you at, I don't even know what it is. Anthony at dot  XM dot. I don't know. Dot, dot. Who knows? It was like your name and then at the dot and  the XM dot. Well, it is weird because we get the company email and we're up here in New York 
[00:13:30]  and the whole compound, which is massive, huge, and awesome down there in Washington.  And then some dope that works down there that I don't even know their name will all of a  sudden just go, hey, anyone see any car keys? I lost my car keys. Maybe a cafe. That's  what it is. And that email is sent out to well over a thousand employees. Yeah. You're a fucking  problems. Throw signs up around the Washington compound. Don't waste my space on my BlackBerry  with your stupidity. You know what the XM BlackBerry is? You ever play a video game where 
[00:14:00]  you go around an office complex and you click on like people's data disks on their desks  and you read through their emails and 90% of it is just garbage and sometimes you get  like a passcode to a door you need? Yeah. That's exactly what it is. That is exactly what  it is. Yeah. Crap. Yeah. So then, or, hey, I baked some muffins. Come by my desk and  grab a, uh, uh, grab one and get all the goodness. It's like, I'm here in New York. 
[00:14:30]  I don't need to hear about your stupid fucking muffins. Walk around with your dumb plate of  muffins. We're trying to get things done here in New York. No wonder people just run into  office buildings and fire at random. Well, don't they make you? Why would you send that  out to the entire, it's, it's called the programming staff or whatever. Yeah. That's an  option. No. Oh, is that an option? What? To send? Yeah. And they'll talk about their  muffins and their lost car keys and the dumbest shit. Stop by the office. I put a new poster 
[00:15:00]  on the wall. Oh, really? Yeah. And that's no shit. Yeah. That's the kind of crap you  get. Yeah. So you're right about that. So you gotta, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta weed  through all that. And the scariest thing is that they knew I wasn't using it. They knew  I wasn't using it. Not because I didn't send anything, but because they knew if I had turned  it on in a certain period of time, cause you haven't been using your Blackberry, have  you? I go, no. Yeah. Uh, one of the tech guys, I guess, uh, said that, uh, you hadn't turned 
[00:15:30]  it on in quite a while. Oh, I'm glad they're keeping track of that. Well, they gave us those  laptops. Oh shit. Oh, you know what? I still haven't turned mine on. Hey, there it is.  I'm like, I still haven't turned mine on. I'm like, yeah, right. You're going to start  tracking me. Go fuck yourself. There's mine. It's right back there behind the monitor. It's  covered in dust. I will never, I know there's tracking on there. I'm like, no one just gives  you a laptop when you join a company. Here you go. Download everything you like. And 
[00:16:00]  with the reputation, uh, we have coming into this new gig at XM, well, it's not new anymore.  We've been here over a year. Uh, I'm like, they're just gathering info for when we do fuck  up. Aces in the hole. That's what they're gathering up. Oh really? You did this and you got a problem  and you might go to court or you might do the, whatever the problem might be. Yeah.  Well, look at this that we gathered from your laptop. Oh, all right. Whatever you want.  Just please. All right. You don't have to pay me anymore. Just please get rid of that. 
[00:16:30]  Please just destroy the laptop. I'm not playing their stupid game. No. They, we, we joined XM  and they go, here you go. A shiny brand new laptop for you and Anthony. Electronic equipment.  I'm like, wait a minute. Why would we ever need a laptop? I thought I heard some beeping  under my Escalade the other day. It's like bait. Beep, beep, beep. It's like a, it's like  a nice fresh worm, but, but, but it comes with a shiny hook. There's a hook in it. You bite, 
[00:17:00]  you bite. Ooh, that laptop's nice. Ooh, a Blackberry. Fuck that. Ow! They got me! They got me!  They, they're just gathering info because we will fuck up again and then they're going  to have to have some kind of, you know, court case and, uh, I don't know. Ain't getting  nothing out of me. But anyway, so, uh, you know, this guy's really pissing me off. Let's  go to Joe in O-Town. Joe, what's up? Dude, I got to call you out on, uh, not charging your  battery, dude. It was in the brand new box. Yeah, but every single electronic device. Not 
[00:17:30]  every single one. I got the, uh, Nintendo DS or whatever it's called and, and that was all  charged and ready to go. Sometimes you get lucky, yeah. I'm sorry, man. I had to call  about it because every time Anthony knows something and you don't, like, no one says anything to  you, but like, everyone like rags on Anthony, you know? Uh, I, I get, uh, ragged on pretty,  uh, pretty regularly. I know Anthony knew that, right? You know that Anthony, right? What?  Joe, he agreed with me. There are times where you don't have to charge the battery. There are  times, yeah. We pop it in and to tell you the truth, I plugged in my, uh, I, I, I put 
[00:18:00]  the battery in my PSP and I had, uh, two batteries, two battery lines on it. Really? Yeah. So  I had no problem. I was, uh, trying to hook it up to my network. Look, we are America.  Get the stupid third world countries to charge our batteries for our fancy gadgets. We're not  asking for much in America. We're fancy, fancy people. We just want batteries that are  charged. Find a country where you can pay someone 30 cents an hour. I want my battery 
[00:18:30]  charged. 30 cents? That's a day's wage. Oh. All right, Joe. All right. See you guys.  I spent, uh, all night trying to, uh, get hooked up to my network. Well, cause I know what you're  going to say. Can I just finish? Cause then, then you can jump in and, uh, relate to this.  So, so then I, uh, I charge it cause I have, um, I went and had dinner at my sister's house.  I'm like, all right, I'll try, I'll charge the PSP here. So now at least on the way, on the  way back to the city, I can play this game infected, see what it's about. That's how 
[00:19:00]  the games I got in my book bag. So I got the battery all nicely charged and I'm ready to  go. I, I throw the game in and now it says, uh, before you pay, uh, play infected, you  have to update your system, your PSP system. There's, there's an issue. So I'm like, all  right. Oh, look, dead bodies. Get this. This is what we were talking about yesterday.  Oh, it's on the news. Yeah. Today's show. Man, we're on top of current events. Look at  that. Look at that. Should dead bodies be on display? We did, we did this whole break 
[00:19:30]  yesterday. Look at that. Controversely. There it is. There's the veins and the capillaries  I was telling you about. The thinker guy with the brain. All right. We got to get this audio.  Okay. I, this is a very, very controversial, uh, exhibit that we were talking about yesterday.  Yeah. And look, look, look, look, look, look, that's a dead body. Yes. Sorry. I know this  is radio, but this, uh, this is all the stuff I saw in Philly. Basketball dead guy. Yeah.  Basketball dead guy with some of his flesh still on and his muscles shown and his tendons  shown. Isn't that unbelievable? Cadaver controversy. Should dead bodies be on display? Beef jerky. 
[00:20:00]  There's the black lung I talked about yesterday. Yeah. All right. We'll get into that. We'll  get the audio. Anyway. So, uh, I charged at my sister's house. Yeah. Okay. So it says update  the system. I'm like, all right, well, and there's a way to do it. So I hit and it goes,  no, you have to plug in the adapter to, uh, update your system. Now, stupid me. I'm not,  I'm not, uh, as good with the technology as Anthony. I'm like, what? Plug it in. So I go 
[00:20:30]  home and the story, I couldn't play the PSP back to the city. Right. And I plug it in to  a, just a wall outlet and now I could update it. What is that about? Hmm. You must have,  uh, someone with a wireless wifi wifi in your apartment and you're probably hooked right  into his. And then they were able to update the PSP, which is nice. You know, it's a,  it must've been nice to be able to pop in and connect to somebody's network. Cause I, I spent  all night trying to get onto, on my network. Oh, they got one of the dead things sitting 
[00:21:00]  on the today show couch. Wow. That's so wild. All right. This audio is going to be great.  Oh, look at that. Matt Lauer's looking over at it. All disgusted. I guess he's a  against it. It's really creepy to be honest with you, but, uh, also very, very interesting  that, that used to be a person. Yeah. How crazy is that? Oh, meat. Get these cadavers that  they're actually going to be on display because there was like a mother and a father and a 
[00:21:30]  small child where they were showing the nerve endings and it just, I don't know. It made  me wonder how they would feel. I mean, it's all polymer preservation and you're right. You  have to worry about, wonder about the human stories behind the bodies, but this is, it's  an amazing technique when it comes right down to it. It uses liquid silicone. Yeah. There's  the thinker over there and the black lung corpses are really interesting too. And a good warning  for people about smoking. I don't know on a weekend, maybe six flags for me. Meanwhile,  still to come this way. All right. Well, six flags instead of, uh, yeah, there's a lot 
[00:22:00]  of, um, like children or younger adults, whatever you want to call them at the exhibit and they  weren't freaked out at all. No, which is pretty interesting. This thing's going to take off.  You watch, it's going to explode. Yeah. But anyway, so I updated the system. You're saying  you couldn't do the, you couldn't update yours? No, I spent all night, all night, just  ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, trying to get the change in IP numbers in the PSP and, and  like the instructions they give you are just like you, you read it and go, Oh God, I got 
[00:22:30]  to do this. I got to find this now, uh, go into your, the router menu and, and it just  for hours. And you know what I accomplished not getting on online with the PSP and fucking  up both laptops in my house to the point where now they can't get online either. So I, I accomplished  not being able to get online from my laptops, uh, anymore. So now I got to go home and fix 
[00:23:00]  that later on. Well, I don't know. I mean the, the Xbox three 60 is coming out today. People  are like waiting online, waiting online in the rain, the rain to be the first ones to get the  Xbox three 60. It's weird with the, you know, these new gaming systems. It's, I need the  dumbed down version. Yeah. I just want to turn it on and start playing games. The menus on  the menu on the PSP is pretty amazing. Yeah. There's a lot of stuff in there. Holy crap. 
[00:23:30]  Well, they want it to be more than just a gaming system. Oh yeah. With the batteries and the  download. I mean the batteries, the movies and the music and stuff you can put in there,  right? Yeah. Oh yeah. You could, uh, have a whole thing with pictures that you take. Download  movies, download your photos, hook it up to your computer at home and do some shit. You didn't get  one Jimmy? No. Sons of bitches. What happened to yours? Kevin, you can't just hand that over.  Yeah. Maybe he wanted to look at it. No, he can't look at it. Then he'll want it more. They,  they, they got mad because I didn't use my Blackberry, but it's like when I wanted the 
[00:24:00]  Blackberry, I didn't want to tie it into the XM account. Like why would they make you do that?  I wanted to tie it into my other account and they, well, it's because they want to track again.  They want to track us. But I get all my emails from you guys that we need for the show on my  regular account. It's forwarded to everything I need from this show is forwarded to my account.  And that's another thing. Every email that is sent through that is like recorded. So  then later on, if there's a controversy, they could pull up every email you've ever sent  to anybody and, you know, see who is responsible for something, things. Remember when we got  fired over there? N.E.W.? Yeah. Well, that's the first thing I did. Yeah. Cause I pulled my 
[00:24:30]  frigging computer out of the wall and ran downstairs with it and threw it in my truck.  I fled the building with this hard drive. Like, that's it. Cause I know what they do.  They paw. Oh, they got me. They got me bad. They got you. I didn't find anything, but they  got me. They get you something to gglitter at ml.com. And that's because it was my computer  also. I had brought my personal home computer there because the computer they had stunk on  ice. Couldn't play games on it. Yeah. Well, that's why we had the paranoia when they handed 
[00:25:00]  us laptops. Like, we know this game. Yep. Cause when we got fired at W.N.E.W. for the  St. Pat's thing, they cornered, they, they, they had tape on our office. Yep. They changed  the locks. I remember getting a phone call from Bob. Um, Anthony? Yeah. The guys are  calling me over at, uh, N.E.W. and they want the hard drive? Oh yeah, Bob. Um, I, I formatted 
[00:25:30]  that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I just pretty much formatted that hard drive. There's nothing  on it anymore. Oh, well, where's the computer? I gave it away. Formatted it, gave it away.  Yeah. It's now far, far away somewhere. You know, why did they, they look at all your emails?  Well, when we were, when the whole thing was going down, they had a tech guy come into our  office and he told me, he goes, step away from the computer. Step away. Step away from the  computer. And then he sat in my chair and just went nuts. Yeah. Just all sorts of coding 
[00:26:00]  and I don't even know what the hell he did. Pulling everything out. Trying to find something  they could use against us. Thank you, no. Which by the way, they never found. You fucking  assholes. No. So, uh, anyway, we do have, uh, one maybe, we only have one PSP left? I  thought we had four total. I think we had two. What happened? Well, we have, uh. I took one,  Opie took one. How many does that leave? We should have two left because we were going to do something  with like the rest of the guys like Eric, Ben, Steve, Travis, Derek, Danny, Nathaniel. The 
[00:26:30]  guys were drooling. I felt bad. They come in and poor Travis looks at me like, I don't have  one of those. I want one. You, you motherfucker can just go with, you know, your lunch money  and go and buy one. And, uh, he looked like he wanted one. So those guys really want one  and, and on the, uh, mere pittance they're paid to work here, I'm sure they can't just  go out and buy it. This is good. It's got like the one gig memory card and everything. 
[00:27:00]  And, uh, so I guess we're going to, we're going to be giving a PSP to one of the staff.  One. Someone stole the other one then. Where's the other one?  Did someone steal the other one?  There's a new controversy, uh, kicking up here because there was supposed to be two  for the rest of the staff.  I only took one home.  Because Jimmy wanted one, but he wasn't sure if he was going to use it. So I'm like, Jimmy,  you know, let's get, let the, you know, these guys have it. And then if you really want one,  we'll just, uh, tell them.  Yeah, Opie gave Jimmy's away.  Yeah.  Like, yeah. 
[00:27:30]  You fucker. I did not.  You did.  I go, are you going to use it? You go, I don't know.  I don't use it, but I, the other, it was all because, it was because of the Blackberry.  Like, I didn't use the Blackberry. She's like, well, if you don't use the Blackberry,  you won't use this.  Then you won't get this.  Blackberry, I would have used it if they didn't make you tie it into your XM account.  So we had to punish you. I'm sorry.  I don't want to be punished.  Punished.  Well, there's a new controversy, though. There's only one BSP left.  Someone took off with the fourth one.  That's what I'm thinking.  Look at Hawk running around now like a madman.  Steve's running around.  Oh, now Steve is going into the office. See, now there's a problem. 
[00:28:00]  Nathaniel is digging through Ben's desk pile.  Who took it?  Who took it?  The guys in this room are not even looking at us anymore.  Did they find it?  Wow, something's going on. Something is going on outside the studio.  Here comes Eric. It looks like he might have found something.  Ah.  Does he have it in his hand?  I think he does. There it is.  Where was it, Eric?  Where was it?  It was on Ben's desk.  Oh, Ben.  Does Ben want it?  I don't know. He's not here.  Oh, okay.  Well, here's the dilemma.  So we got, how many people want this? 
[00:28:30]  Pretty much everybody? Steve?  Yeah.  Steve wants it.  Nathaniel wants it.  Travis wants it.  Dirk wants it.  Danny wants it.  I see you, Danny.  So, but we only have two, so we want to have some kind of competition with these guys today.  Are those two different types?  Is one better than the other?  Two different types.  One have the memory card?  The one gig?  Wait, which one has the one gig?  One has the one gig and one has a 32 megabyte.  Oh, boy.  Wait a minute.  One of the blue box rocks.  A first and a second prize. 
[00:29:00]  Uh-oh.  Holy shit.  I didn't get a blue box.  Oh, dude.  You got the shitty memory card then.  Is that all the difference?  Mm-hmm.  Yep.  You sure?  32.  How much is the gigs in the big one?  You get one gig in the big one and you get like 32 megs on the small one.  Oh, okay.  You can't really fit much.  What can you fit on one gig, though?  Can you fit a lot of movies on one gig?  No, not really.  A lot of songs.  You hold them.  They're like the little handheld things and you can watch movies on them.  Those are great, man.  Yeah.  I like those.  There's selling movies for this now. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, you can put movies in there.  You pop them in a disc in the back.  The disc goes in there.  Yeah.  But can you put a stand for them?  Because you've got to hold them right now.  Yeah, there is a little stand.  Ooh.  A little plastic stand came with the blue box.  It looks like we're going to have to get another PSP.  No, no, no.  Blue box is better.  Six-hour flight.  That's pretty cool on a six-hour flight.  One is the Gigapack, and the other is the Value Pack.  Value Pack.  You don't want the Value Pack.  Shit, I got the wrong one.  You got the Value Pack? 
[00:30:00]  No wonder your battery wasn't charged.  Mine was charged and made of solid gold.  Amazing.  Love it.  That's not true.  Anthony, are you an Italian?  I corrected everybody.  No.  You're going to say, that's not true?  I was going to say, that's bullshit.  That's not true.  Anthony in Pennsylvania, what's up?  Yeah, I just wanted to say that corporations these days, just by the very nature of your  computers being on their network, they can lift things off your hard drive and check your 
[00:30:30]  email in real time.  Yeah.  Yeah, I totally believe that.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's crazy, man.  So you have no privacy.  If you take the computer and run, it does nothing.  If they really wanted to, they'd have all that today, tomorrow.  Now, back in NEW, they didn't have that technology there.  Yeah, we get to go back a few years.  Now, the same scenario, you're right, but I don't think they had that in place back  then.  Now everything goes through their filter.  All right.  Thanks, Anthony.  Tell them Fred is writing, if you remember, Jim didn't even know what a PSP was in his 
[00:31:00]  pop culture quiz.  Probably not, but I didn't know.  Do we have the second pop culture quiz for Jim Northampton?  But I knew what it is by sight, because I just didn't know what it was called.  Okay.  What's in the name?  Shakespeare wrote something about a rose.  All right, listen.  Listen.  So we got these two PSPs to give away.  How are we going to do it?  These guys want to have a little competition to see who gets the PSPs.  Got to be a competition.  Yeah.  Maybe the listeners could come up with something.  Something quick and fast for this.  Got to be a competition.  No, not arm wrestling. 
[00:31:30]  Not arm wrestling?  Silly.  That means Travis doesn't get one.  No.  Not at all.  A little broken arm.  Yeah.  Fucking spindly douche.  Who would you say would win an arm wrestling contest?  Nathaniel.  Obviously.  Yeah.  He's a lot bigger than everyone else.  Yeah, he's taller, but I would have picked Derek.  I would have picked Derek.  No?  You know that Nathaniel was this close to getting that giantism thing that we were talking about  last week?  He's like, what are you, 6'4"? 
[00:32:00]  That's not that close to the giantism, big-headed thing.  When did you stop growing?  You're talking about slipping a chromosome or something.  No, he looks fine, but, you know, you probably were starting to sweat it, right?  No, I was, you know.  How tall are you?  Six, I'd like to say 6'5".  I was growing six inches every year.  And then my parents started to notice something wrong with my head, so they took me to a specialist,  and that's when I was diagnosed with giantism. 
[00:32:30]  Here's some of my baby pictures.  They're perfectly normal, up until eight months old.  That's when my parents started going, I think there's something wrong with my child, took  me to the doctor.  Big, misshapen head.  They had the tallest man in the world, what's his name, that we were talking about last week?  Waslow, or whatever his name was.  Yeah.  And they have a picture of him in, like, sixth grade. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, it's always the sixth grade picture, he's powering, just ruining the photo.  It's not even close.  Here I am in sixth grade.  That was already six age.  Of course, I'm in the back row.  This is Mary.  Mary, I remember I was, I had quite a crush on her, and she ran in horror, screaming from  me.  So I had that big head.  And my lurch posters on the wall.  I had to relate to somebody back then.  What size is your shoe? 
[00:33:30]  I have a size 28 shoe.  My feet kept growing very hard for my mother to keep me in clothes.  Yeah.  I would grow out of them by the next morning.  I bet you have a special bed, possibly.  Yes, actually, I had to put two beds foot to head to sleep for quite a while when I was  at home.  And then I would wake up, and they built a dormer for me in the attic, because I kept cracking  my head on the ceiling.  The ceiling was 10 foot 3. 
[00:34:00]  I kept cracking my big, stupid-looking, misshapen head.  My to-serve-man, Twilight Zone head.  And I hear your brother was normal size, right?  Well, the rest of my family were all normal size.  Yeah.  So I really looked freakish.  But I bet you were a normal kid.  Just a normal kid.  I loved actually playing baseball.  Yeah.  I loved sports.  You had a six-foot strike zone.  Very hard to pitch to. 
[00:34:30]  Of course, if I did hit the ball, I couldn't run at all.  I just looked like some freaky creep.  It was great.  I'm trying to run.  And I looked more like that big alien that came out of the ship in close encounters at  the end, raising his arms.  What about showering?  All these things that you take for granted are very difficult for me and my giant misshapen  head.  I would try to take a shower.  Actually, the water, the highest I could get it was penis height. 
[00:35:00]  So I was big, but I had very clean genitals.  I couldn't shampoo my hair on that huge misshapen head.  Sometimes puddles would form in those crevices in my head.  I thought you were a normal kid.  I just tried to be normal.  You know, just try to fit in with everybody.  Here's me at my prom.  Here's a picture of me at my prom. 
[00:35:30]  Yes, it does look completely ridiculous.  It's me and Thumbelina at the prom.  Well, weren't you getting nervous there, Nathaniel?  6'5"?  You've got to start thinking when you're getting up over 6.  Do the parents think that they're going to have to deal with, uh-oh, the neighbors are  going to make fun?  Well, my dad's 6'6", so...  Oh, really?  Yeah.  All right.  Mine's pretty tall.  Mom's 5'10", so...  Wow.  Wow.  You could have been a lot taller, even. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  I think I got the nice, normal side of the bell curve.  You definitely did all right.  You've got any siblings, do you?  I do.  How tall?  My brother is about the same height, too.  Man.  You just must be the family walking down the street like, ah!  Just a bunch of them.  Give us your shit, Nathaniel.  Did you play basketball?  Yes, I did.  How many times have you been asked that?  Every...  Every fucking day, right?  Every time someone meets me.  What about the Giants?  What about the Giants in the studio?  Did you, uh...  Were you talked into playing basketball? 
[00:36:30]  I got a lot of joint problems.  Yeah.  I got the, um...  Osteoporosis.  Yeah.  I have some, uh...  Rheumatoid arthritis.  So it makes it hard to really move.  Um...  I was tall enough to put the, uh...  Ball in the basket, but once they passed the ball to me, I really couldn't move on the  floor at all.  Very difficult.  Lumbering.  Lumbering.  I looked like a newborn moose.  Just big, big knobby joints that couldn't really move. 
[00:37:00]  Not sure.  Sometimes my legs would shake and I'd fall down.  Very difficult.  All right.  Big head that could probably fit moose antlers, too.  Nathaniel, you got a good idea for the PSP giveaway for you guys?  Um, well, there was some mention of staples.  Staple gun roulette?  Yeah.  You know, when I saw that email, uh...  I thought, great idea.  I'd been through it. 
[00:37:30]  I'd been through it.  I mean, Opie, you've been through the staple gun challenge.  Yep.  It, uh...  The fans seem to really enjoy it.  So, I don't know.  That could be a good one.  You know how that works, don't you?  Uh...  Do you recall?  Yeah.  I believe you take a, uh...  Newspaper.  Ordinary newspaper.  The Daily News.  The Post.  Uh, yeah.  You...  Go ahead.  Put it on your leg.  Put it over your leg.  It's pretty thick, the newspaper.  Take a standard staple gun.  And...  Through the newspaper. 
[00:38:00]  Of course, what will that do?  Nothing.  Yeah.  Doesn't do anything.  Then the other guy does it.  Nothing.  Now, here's the trick.  You take away a page.  Just one page.  It's paper thin.  What difference could it make?  Probably none.  Psh, psh.  Nothing.  Psh, psh.  Nothing.  Another page goes.  Repeat, repeat, repeat.  Before you know it, you go,  Ooh!  I think the staple is making it through the paper.  Because you feel a little tinge on your leg. 
[00:38:30]  Another page.  Another...  Before you know it,  a lot of that staple is coming through the paper  and going into your leg.  And who wins?  It's the one that has the least amount of pages left.  Or no pages.  It's a great idea,  but knowing these guys,  they'll go the distance,  all of them.  Even frail little Travis.  Dude.  They will all grail little Travis.  Staple goes through his leg breaks.  I'm glad he's stuck to the chair. 
[00:39:00]  A waffer thin gentleman, sir.  A little toothpick leg.  Well, we've got to figure this out.  I don't know if that's going to work.  I'm telling you.  I think these guys will all take a staple.  I thought, you know,  when you first start the game,  you're all cocky thinking,  you know,  you're going to go the distance.  When it starts going through  and really hurting,  it's very hard to work up the guts  to do that next one  and the next one.  I say a nail gun  with the New York Times.  Well, we can start 
[00:39:30]  with the Sunday Times,  you know,  just to give it a little padding.  How about over the ball bag?  Ooh, over the ball bag.  For the staple.  Jimmy will do the stapling.  No, that can really injure  some vital components.  I would if we use  like a regular staple  that you have to hit  and it has to be on the desk.  We've got to shove your yam bag  in the old swing line.  All right, well,  we have to figure this out.  If you guys,  any of the other boys  have an idea for this contest? 
[00:40:00]  No?  Wow.  Uncreative bunch of asses.  Well, I was thinking of an idea.  It's kind of hard to put the job  to the people  that are going to be winning it.  All right, alphabetical order.  Height.  Height, yeah.  He picks height.  We've got an eggnog  drinking contest coming up.  I think, by the way,  it's going to be  a week from Friday.  The eggnog drinking contest.  Eggnog drinking contest.  We could do, uh,  we could do the old  drink water  until you have the leak game. 
[00:40:30]  I don't know about  the drink water thing.  Why?  Last guy that runs out of here  to take a leak?  Take a leak, yeah.  If they're drinking like,  if they're drinking,  I don't know,  you know,  a half a cup of water  every minute.  Yeah.  I don't know.  People die from that.  They're not going to die from that.  That's one of those  hazing things  that people have been  dying from.  Yeah.  But it's just these guys.  Yeah.  They're replaceable.  Don't get me wrong.  I don't care about that. 
[00:41:00]  I just care about the lawsuit.  Oh, yeah.  Good point.  Their families  probably care for them.  How about chatter  or something else  that they won't die from?  Yeah.  They're not going to die  from the water game.  You and I did that  way back in the day.  Well, the diaper  and the drink in the water?  Yeah.  Wearing the depend all day?  Yeah.  We weren't doing like shots  though like that.  It was just  drink normally  and try not to piss.  I was drinking beers.  Beers might be,  you know.  How about these guys decide,  you know,  how much water  they can take? 
[00:41:30]  It's up to them.  I don't know  if they really know  how much water  will give them  that fucking  water on the brain thing  and put them  in a water coma.  It's not,  get a doctor on the phone.  You really don't care  whether we live or die,  do you?  All right,  let me ask you this,  Nathaniel.  Would you do this bit?  What?  Would you do the bit  for the PSP?  Yes.  See?  Danny?  What about a power hour?  A power hour?  Shot a beer a minute  for an hour?  Well, we can't do  the beer thing.  Why?  They're kind of like  employees and shit. 
[00:42:00]  How about a duty contest?  Oh, someone's got  I win.  Someone's got a great idea.  Fight club.  Yeah, but Nathaniel  takes jujitsu.  He'd kick the shit  in the woods.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Good point.  Yeah, he is a karate guy.  That's a good idea.  Good point.  The fact that water  can cause fatal overdose  is not well known.  It's called water intoxication.  Yeah, but how much  does it take?  I hear it takes like gallons.  Water poisoning results  when too much water  is ingested  in a short amount of time  without replenishing  electrolytes,  particularly sodium  and potassium,  which you need  to kind of dilute  your system.  Get Gatorade. 
[00:42:30]  Maintains an equilibrium  of the human body  of electrolytes  in the bloodstream.  I'm trying to see how much.  Water poisoning deaths  are real,  although small.  Problem with recreational use.  Health and water issue page.  Occasional deaths  in the U.S. and Canada.  Accidentally drinking  too much water,  some from intentional  or forced overconsumption.  as a case of a young man  required to drink  two or more gallons  of water  as part of the college 
[00:43:00]  fraternity hazing.  Two or more gallons  of water  this guy drank  and he died.  What happens?  Your water fills your brain?  No, it dilutes  your system so much  that all the vital  little nutrients  like sodium,  things like that,  aren't effective anymore.  Nah, you've got to have  weak DNA for that to happen.  You think it's you're weak?  You can't.  It's water.  It's stupid water.  Stop.  But we're not allowed to piss.  That's the problem.  No, no, no,  but when you're going to die,  you can go.  Yeah. 
[00:43:30]  Well, someone's suggesting  the old icy hot  on the balls trick.  Wow.  How do you win that?  That's a brutal one.  Yeah, how do you win that?  You don't.  We do.  It's an all-lose scenario.  Icy hot on the balls.  Jesus.  Eric.  Eric just pulled out  the icy hot.  And his balls.  That's right.  All right, guys, line up.  Line up.  I'll swipe some  on their nutsack.  Get a good one.  I don't like you shaving.  Get a good dollop.  Yeah, a dollop.  Let's get a dollop of icy hot. 
[00:44:00]  Who's going to make sure  that they put it on  and how much?  And then what?  And then what?  Eric's so eager  to take it on.  Yeah.  Ooh.  And then what?  It's like the last person  to leave the studio  to wipe it off.  It's brutal  on the ballies.  It's beyond brutal.  I don't know.  That's a good one?  But isn't there  a way to make it  even worse?  Like you put the icy hot  and then it's like  cold water?  Or you apply it  with a Zim Zam paddle. 
[00:44:30]  A meat tenderizer.  Well, Kevin in Minnesota  has a great idea.  Kevin, go ahead.  What's going on, fellas?  Hey.  Hey.  Up here in Minnesota,  my brother and I  get in trouble  back in the day.  My dad had his little  mini three-foot canoe paddles.  Yeah.  It's nothing gay or queer  or nothing,  but I have the boys  drop their pants  and then have Jimmy  rear up on that paddle  and give them  shot for shot. 
[00:45:00]  That is so gay.  Guys paddling other guys  in any circumstance,  in any context, sir,  is so gay,  so homoerotic.  Jimmy would be doing it.  He loves trannies.  Yeah, Jimmy.  I don't paddle other men.  It's not happening  unless they've been bad.  Well, this is more of a...  I wish I knew  how to quit you.  I wish I knew  how to quit you.  All right, Kevin.  Thank you.  I wish I knew  how to quit you.  Well, the Icy Hot 
[00:45:30]  thing can work.  Oh, you like that,  don't you, faggot?  Who would Icy Hot  today for the PSP?  Definitely Icy Hot.  Danny would Icy Hot.  But what's the end game?  The end game  is they stay in the studio,  the screamer would get  to the point  they would have to run out.  I don't know.  Does that happen?  I don't know if it happens.  And then the tie  is decided by height.  I don't know...  I don't know  if it happens.  If you wipe that  on your nutsack,  is it going to hurt?  There would be hell.  We need a test. 
[00:46:00]  There would be hell.  We need someone  to test first  that isn't involved  in the contest  to see if it's worth  doing the contest for.  Because if we do  the contest,  it doesn't work.  So somebody  not involved  in the contest  is going to have  to do it.  I have little balls.  And that would...  That would make a difference.  No.  Conserve the icy hot.  Wouldn't need as much.  Your tiny little nutsack. 
[00:46:30]  Bring in Bill.  Oh, intern Bill.  Why don't we bring in...  Bill will do anything.  How about if Bill  just takes just  a slight dollop?  A slight dollop  and wipes it  on his nutsack?  Yeah.  Where is he?  We need a test subject.  Somewhere loading  magazines?  Where is he?  Why don't we bring in Ben  and then just put him  on with a paint roller? 
[00:47:00]  Bill's doing a food order.  Oh, Bill's doing  a food order.  All right,  we'll wait for Bill  to come back.  How's that?  We'll wait for Bill  to come back.  He could swipe on  a dollop  and we'll see  if it's really that bad.  Where he has to  flee the studio.  Who would dollop  for the PSP?  Danny?  Eric?  Holy crap.  Eric's eligible?  No offense,  but never mind.  No, I'll say it.  The guy won  $100,000.  Thank you.  From show papers. 
[00:47:30]  Go fuck yourself.  Buy it.  From show papers.  Still that controversy  that you should have  shared with everybody  because it was  the show's paper.  Hey, he bought us  a rock and roll sandwich.  What do you mean  we started?  Let's not  dump on it too much.  The Philly cheesesteak  was delicious.  Thanks.  What do you mean  show papers?  It was the papers  from here,  not his personal  home paper.  And he scratched it off  and realized  it was one of those  false winners.  So he had to send it in  and they drew it  out of a hat.  Well, we need  at least three contestants  though. 
[00:48:00]  If we don't get three  then Eric's in.  Travis is in.  Skinny.  I know Derek  won't do it.  I know him pretty well.  Derek ain't fucking  doing nothing  with his ball bag.  He's a creep  with open-toed sandals.  Does he have that?  He always does  his stupid little  fucking toes  sticking out.  Why are you  looking at feet?  I don't understand  guys that look  at other guys'  shoes and stuff.  You can't not see it  when you look  at a man's feet.  I don't look  at a man's feet.  How do you not?  You're not giving  them the up and down.  You're like a man.  You look them in the eye. 
[00:48:30]  A bunch of people  suck my cock.  A bunch of people  from Wack Bag  were commenting on  the fact that I was  wearing sandals  with white socks.  Remember that?  Well, that is silly.  It was a whole thread.  Well, because I  inline skate to work  and it's easy  just to throw on  some TVs or something  after I get here.  And all these people  are like,  what's wrong with  Ope?  He's wearing sandals  with white socks  and I'm sitting there  at home like,  why are you guys  talking about the fact  that I have white socks  and sandals on?  Who took the picture? 
[00:49:00]  Put it online.  It was a fan  that wanted a picture  one day after the show.  I'm like,  yeah, no problem.  Oh.  And then they're  commenting because  I still got the  TVs on with the  white socks  because it was  after the show.  I'm ready to take  the TVs off  and throw my skates  on.  Yeah.  But then they have  a whole discussion  about this.  Bill do that.  It was bizarre to me.  I'm coming into work  with a bunch of guys.  It doesn't matter  what we look like.  Mm-hmm.  All right,  so where's Bill?  Food order.  Still.  All right,  so we got three.  One, two. 
[00:49:30]  We got to have  Eric do it too, man.  Just for fun?  Yeah.  Rich Eric.  Yeah.  For fun.  Wealthy Eric.  Yeah.  There are two of these,  right?  Yeah.  It's not like  there's only one.  I don't know why  I had to say that  if you said there's two.  So what's it going to be?  The last two left?  That's kind of...  Well, that's what  we got to figure out.  I think there should  be two separate contests.  If anyone has done  this icy hot thing,  give us a call  because we got to  figure out the details. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, I don't know.  I think what's going  to happen,  I'm assuming that  it's going to be so brutal  you're going to want  it just off you  and that's when  you just run out  of the studio  to take care of yourself.  Does it get hotter though?  I don't know.  How does icy hot work?  I don't know.  We need some icy hot experts.  How about we take a break?  We'll use Bill  as a test subject.  All right.  And then we'll get  the rest of the guys  who want in  and they'll do it  and then we'll get a winner.  Oh, Steve doesn't want in?  Uh, no.  Steve? 
[00:50:30]  Oh.  Bill's back by the way.  He has no idea  what we were talking about.  No, I've put icy hot  on the balls before.  That hurts.  You have?  How bad is it?  It burns.  It burns a lot.  I mean, like just residual stuff.  Like, I mean,  I've been putting it on  like sore muscles  and then went to scratch  my nuts kind of.  All right.  And that hurts enough.  Someone's got a great...  Maybe I'm not going to do it again.  Someone's got a great idea.  Bib from Whack Bag,  add more icy hot  as the contest goes along.  Hmm.  That's a great idea.  A fan to blow air on it.  Ooh.  Oh, you mean  like a mechanical fan. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah, you did.  I thought just a fan  of men's nuts.  Making his way  into the studio,  it's Bill the intern.  There he is.  Hey, everyone.  Who's crazy.  Bill, we got an idea.  Mm-hmm.  But then maybe  we should have him  in on the contest.  Please, he's a ringer.  Yeah.  He wouldn't even wipe it off  when the contest was over.  No.  All right, Bill.  Stay around the rest  of the day with it  on his side.  Bill, here's the idea, okay?  Mm-hmm.  We got Nathaniel, Danny, 
[00:51:30]  Travis, you're in, right?  Travis, and possibly Eric.  They're going to try  to win these PSPs  that we got yesterday.  We want to do  an icy hot contest.  Okay.  But we need a test subject  to see how bad  it would actually be.  Oh, yeah?  So all we're...  Oh, yeah.  So all we're asking  is if you would just take  just a little of this icy hot.  It's extra strength.  He knew we weren't going  to ask him  to find somebody  to test it.  Right.  And then just take  a little dollop.  You don't have to go crazy.  Throw it on your ball sack  and we wanted to see  how effective  this contest would be. 
[00:52:00]  Because it seems  that things don't affect you  like other human beings.  Yeah.  So we're thinking  if we do get  a good reaction out of you,  then the reaction  out of these guys  will be even that much better.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Just a little, I guess.  All right, good.  I'll try.  All right.  And we don't want  to see you actually doing it  so you can like  turn around  and throw it in your...  Yeah, turn around.  Well, how do we know  who's seriously...  How do you know  who's putting how much  on their bag?  Yeah, you guys can't cheat.  That's true.  You guys can't cheat?  Please, that's all  I would do is cheat.  We...  We...  Somebody. 
[00:52:30]  You're going to have  to see the bags  and I'm not being a...  The bottom line is this.  You're going to have  to see the bags.  No, I'm not looking  at enough bags.  How about this?  You got to keep  your mule in  but you just pop your bag  out through the zipper.  It's a bunch of bags.  Who cares?  Why don't you make  Bill the spotter?  Just hang the brain  a little.  Just fucking bags.  Huh?  So what?  Why are you going  to make Ray watch  ball bags?  He's just concocting  his own fantasy here.  Yeah.  Ben's ball bags. 
[00:53:00]  Ray.  Some icy hot.  Come here.  Ray does a great job.  No, over there.  Ray, what are you doing?  Ray does a great job  for us behind the scenes  and he has a killer  radio voice.  Would you watch guys  put icy hot  on their ball bags?  Sure.  Talk into the mic.  Sure.  You don't mind?  I don't care.  Wait, do we have  to agree too?  Yeah, these guys  would probably mind.  I like Ray.  I'm thinking, 
[00:53:30]  you know,  Ray's a good guy.  You gotta go  whipping your bag out.  You gotta have a spotter.  You have to for something.  It's not fair if you don't.  How about if they're  down in their underwear  and then they pull  the front out a little bit  and they got the dollop  on their fingers  and it has to go somewhere.  It's gotta go somewhere.  You wipe it on the ball bag  and somebody will  actually watch  from behind  and make sure  that they, uh...  It'll be obvious  if they're wiping  on their leg or something.  He's gotta know.  But first,  we gotta start with Bill  to see, uh...  Bill's our test subject.  This is so gay.  What is this called 
[00:54:00]  in science  when you have the...  Gay.  Hot.  Guinea pig?  No.  The test subject?  It's a, it's a,  it's a, um...  Control group?  Yeah.  Yeah.  A control.  Thank you.  Here you go, Bill.  It's all upside for you, Bill.  All right, Bill, uh...  Get a, get a good, uh...  Oh, wow, you can't even just...  Should we, uh, nuke it a little bit?  All the agony with no, uh,  no prize.  We're good.  Oh, he got some.  Yeah, you could get some in there.  Get like two fingers.  You want to heat it up slightly?  Someone heat this up  for like 15 seconds. 
[00:54:30]  That's a...  15 seconds?  No?  That'll be blazing.  Bill, I said a little,  you psycho.  That's good.  Yeah.  I'm not gonna wipe that.  All right, go ahead.  Rub that on your bag there.  His whole fist in there like Caligula.  Wait, get...  All right, get on the mic.  Wiping some off of his fingers, though.  What a curse.  Yeah, I just, uh,  gotta wipe, get a little.  I'll turn around right now.  All right.  That's right.  Face that, face that right there,  inside.  That's one way, Glenn.  Make fucking Travis and Derek  see a bag.  Now, really wipe it on.  Wipe it on the undercarriage. 
[00:55:00]  Ugh.  How about you gotta wipe it  up the back of the shaft  and over the hole, too?  And if you have any open sores,  we want it wiped on that, too.  That would have been the best  if we had a chick,  we planned this  and had a chick come in  and shave their bags  and then apply Icy Hot.  That would have been  really fucking on the list.  Yeah, yeah.  If it shook...  A little bit.  You got a little bit  on your sack.  All right, Ed?  Any sensation?  He doesn't care.  Yeah.  What's it feeling like? 
[00:55:30]  Icy?  Well, at first it was icy.  And then...  Eventually,  it's getting hotter.  Yeah, so they're gonna  need a bit of this.  I think you should  heat it up a little  and get a good, like,  tablespoon.  Tablespoon?  Oh.  And make sure they all  have the correct  equal measurement  for each person.  And, uh...  This is hurting a lot more  than I would have thought it would.  Is it really hurting now?  What is it?  What is it?  Is it a sting  or a burn or... 
[00:56:00]  Burn.  It's a burn.  Yeah.  Did you apply it  to the underside  of your bag?  Yeah.  I love that we can't  get a reaction.  No.  It's actually...  This really sucks.  Build rules.  I can deal with it, though,  but I think this would be  a very good competition  for those guys.  Ooh.  Little heated up.  Oh, look at that.  Those of us with nerve endings.  Yeah.  Those of us with a soul.  Not deadened 
[00:56:30]  by some pharmaceutical.  Wow.  And?  Yeah, this, uh...  I'm having trouble  coming up with  things to say right now.  I'm really concentrating  on not...  Screaming?  I can deal with it, I think.  As long as it doesn't  get any worse than it is.  Now, get...  Try this.  Get a cup of water,  somebody.  Get a cup of water,  two fingers,  wet your fingers,  and then wet the area  that you just rubbed on.  Was I going to make it worse?  Well, I don't know. 
[00:57:00]  See, I don't know.  I've heard water kind of...  How about we have...  I learned how those guys do it,  seeing how they're in the competition  and I get nothing  from doing this.  Wow, that's the first time  he's actually come close  to saying no to something.  Do you realize you're becoming  a star on this program?  Sure.  I guess.  He's doing the pee-pee dance.  Now, just try a couple of fingers  first in the water.  Fingers for all you motherfuckers.  Well, we'll have the guys  dip in the water,  dip in the icy hot. 
[00:57:30]  Apply.  I think the water's got to go after, though.  All right, so, icy hot?  Yeah, here he goes.  He's putting his wet fingers.  Jesus.  Here we go.  All right.  Who the hell is that?  Is that one?  Is that Grey Wolf?  Is that him?  No, that's not Grey Wolf.  Move out of the way.  I don't know.  Is that Grey Wolf?  No.  Is that guy going to throw a sink  through the fucking window?  Do we have a new homeless guy  that's coming in?  Yeah, a new homeless guy.  Not the Grey Wolf,  but another Indian film. 
[00:58:00]  We're getting ready  for the homeless shopping spree as well,  and every week,  Keith brings in a new homeless guy  for us to interview.  What is it doing?  I put water on it.  It seems to just be stinging a lot.  I think this would be  a good competition for those guys.  I mean, a jiu-jitsu expert  like Nathaniel might be able  to psych out the pain,  and I know Danny is really good  at doing stuff,  like crazy things.  Like with his sack.  Yeah, and so... 
[00:58:30]  I don't know.  I'm just having trouble  thinking on my feet right now.  I think that's great  for one of them.  There's got to be two contests.  There's two different PSPs.  Yeah.  Wow.  All right, for one.  How much did you actually put on?  You put on very little,  didn't you?  Like a finger's worth.  But it wasn't even clumped up.  It was like just spread on your...  Yeah, this guy's going to have...  It was a bit clumped up.  I mean, I took a lot off...  All right.  Because I had two fingers at first,  and I took a bit off...  Heat this off for like 10 seconds  just to get it a little softer.  Don't go nuts. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, look at the instructions first.  See if it's going to blow up  the microwave.  Who cares?  That's what I love about Bill.  He's in pain right now,  but that's the best reaction  we're going to get out of him.  That's the same reaction  he'd have if he was  murdering a prostitute.  Yeah.  Just the same, no...  Nothing.  Nothing.  It's all focus.  The person that he's killing  is thinking with their last thought,  like, my God,  how can he just stand there like that?  He's unfeeling.  Yeah.  So unfeeling.  The head tilts like Michael Myers  when he's confused.  Why is the homeless guy 
[00:59:30]  drinking a beer out of a Starbucks cup?  I don't know.  He's classy.  He's an Indian dude.  He certainly is an Indian.  All right.  Guy from Predator.  All right, Bill,  you can go to the bathroom if you want.  Yeah, he looks like the guy from Predator.  All right.  No, it's a big mess.  You think it'll be a good contest?  Yeah.  And these guys will have to keep applying  every, what, five minutes?  Billy Bear.  That sounds about right.  Every five minutes, Ant?  Yeah.  Or what?  Yeah, all right.  Yeah.  All right, cool.  All right, thanks, Bill.  So what is the method of removal 
[01:00:00]  if not water?  That's your problem.  Yeah.  Okay.  You better get some towels.  All right.  What's that static?  It might be the wireless.  It might be the wireless.  All right, why don't we take a...  The wireless.  Why don't we take a break  and we'll figure out  this whole Icy Hot thing.  Next, okay?  Good idea.  For the PSPs, for the boys.  Francine.  Who invented the airplanes?  Oh. 
[01:00:30]  I don't remember.  Could you give me a clue?  Just pick a name out of a hat.  What did the...  Kitty Hawk.  What did the first airplane look like?  Uh, it had wings  and a thing that spins in the front.  Right.  Very good.  Right.  I believe it was invented by BMW.  Right.  Right.  I think it spun in the back, didn't it?  There's two of them.  Yeah.  There's just one.  Actually, it was...  Right.  And they were small. 
[01:01:00]  Right.  They were much wider.  How many passengers could it hold?  Two.  And who were those two?  I don't know.  It was the BMW brothers.  Their name.  Of...  Right.  Right.  They were German?  Right.  Right.  Absolutely right.  You're so right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Again, Francine.  Too right.  You know, I went to go see my brothers.  Yeah.  This weekend.  Right.  Mm-hmm.  Right.  And my brothers were... 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, I hadn't talked to them in a while.  Um, will Burr be playing, uh, somewhere this weekend?  Yeah.  You're right.  Right.  My brothers are coming to my show in Montclair, New Jersey.  Yeah?  Mm-hmm.  Very good.  You think it was wrong to do what we did earlier?  Nah, that was right.  Yeah.  It was very right.  We gotta stick together if the cops come here because, uh, we're brothers.  Right.  All right. 
[01:02:00]  Very good, brothers.  Right.  BMW invented the airplane.  Yep.  Uh, anyone ever call you Will?  Oh, yeah.  Is it Bill?  That just seems weird with my last name.  Wilbur?  Yeah.  Wilbur.  Yeah.  Wilbur.  Right.  Wilbur.  Mm-hmm.  Huh.  Well, anyway.  I can't think anything.  You can't, uh, it's not coming to you?  No.  That's a tough one.  All right.  You don't know the brothers' names.  But she's got the last name, the BMW.  Um, or, will I be at, um, Bananas in Cincinnati? 
[01:02:30]  I don't know, Will.  I don't know, Will.  I don't know, Will.  Will Burr be at, right.  All right, let's go to Tomboy from Illinois.  Tomboy.  Yeah?  Oh, you're a chick.  What's up? 
[01:03:00]  Oh, not much.  Tense Tomboy.  I know.  So, what do you got for the show today?  Well, I got a little warning about that Icy Hot contest.  Oh, yeah.  One of my friends in high school did it.  And he left it on for maybe ten minutes, but it gave him such a bad reaction that he  couldn't masturbate over three weeks.  He couldn't jerk off for three weeks after he did it?  Nope.  That's impossible.  He could barely even run.  That's impossible.  You find ways.  You just would. 
[01:03:30]  That's what he told me.  Like, he could not do it.  Yeah.  I think he has other problems.  Especially in high school or, you know, that age where you're just spanking it all the  time.  I remember cranking once when I was a kid so much like a monkey that I was chafing.  And I still did it.  You just work around it.  Yeah.  Open sores and everything.  You'll find a piece that's uninfected.  I'm down to using my thumb and index finger at the base.  You know, like the lowest possible pleasure you could have. 
[01:04:00]  You just, it's all that's left.  The only area that doesn't hurt to touch anymore.  Like the, uh, like the bottom of a, of an asparagus.  Yeah.  That part.  The part of the asparagus you cut off.  Yeah.  There's still some feeling down there.  There's some taste if you really need it.  I can work it.  All right, Jason, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I got a story.  When I was in high school playing football and shit, these guys put out some Icy Hot  in this guy's girdle.  You know, that shit that holds your pants and shit right around your nuts.  Yeah. 
[01:04:30]  We get out there and he's whining, grabbing his junk and shit.  Then the coach made us run some laps.  So we get sweat going, open up those pores.  I thought this fucker was going to cry, man.  Oh, really?  They always heard those stories of the sadistic coaches.  Jumping jacks or shit for it.  You know?  Get them sweating and shit for it.  Put that stuff on there.  All right.  Sadistic gym teachers and coaches that did that and made the guys run.  Yeah.  Put it in their jocks.  Those homosexual gym teachers.  All right, Jason.  I think we're just about ready for the contest.  Ah.  What do you think?  This is a quick one, huh? 
[01:05:00]  What do you think?  Look at that.  Thawed up and ready to execute.  Why not?  First, we got a quick story.  Holiday season upon us.  It certainly is.  Are you feeling any merriment yet?  Fuck no.  No.  I'm feeling the gridlock.  Christmas is for young kids.  Gridlock alert here in the city.  And then yesterday, I actually got mad for a second.  And then, you know, I try to blow things off.  So I got mad for a second and then I realized what I was getting mad at.  One of the lanes on 57th Street was closed, the right lane. 
[01:05:30]  So, of course, it makes big traffic and you've got to go around it and everything.  And it was a truck that was stopped putting up Christmas wreaths on the light poles.  I'm like, motherfuckers, I'm trying to get...  They're putting up fucking Christmas wreaths.  Could I just have a moment here of being nice and...  Yeah, you can't be mad at that, right?  Not being pissed that they're decorating the city up for Christmas.  Well, listen closely and hear what they're doing in Boston.  The holidays are taking on a more neutral tone in Beantown.  Boston city officials have come up with a less politically charged term for their holiday centerpiece. 
[01:06:00]  Rather than call it a Christmas tree or a Hanukkah bush, they decided to go with a holiday tree.  The 48-foot spruce will stand in the Boston Common.  City leaders say they renamed the Christmas tree to avoid offending anyone who does not believe in Christmas.  Holy shit.  It's not really a holiday tree.  It's a Christmas tree.  It's supposed to gather families together and bring in Christmas.  That's interesting.  That's probably politically correct, isn't it?  The city will light the tree at a special ceremony next week. 
[01:06:30]  Who's the guy that comes up with these bright ideas?  Yeah, under what kind of pressure?  Like, how many people actually complain?  And how many people really either don't care or want it to remain a Christmas tree?  Why the fucking ACLU sues because it's some sort of a religious symbol because of Christians?  They always do that shit.  That's what they do.  But why do we get penalized for coming up with the greatest holiday of all time?  Greatest ever.  Greatest ever.  We come up with this great holiday and we get penalized every fucking year. 
[01:07:00]  Everyone tries to dilute it.  Make it their own.  Tough shit.  You guys didn't come up with this.  It's not yours.  The whole tree with the lights and the presents under it.  There's just a lot of religions out there very jealous of us because we came up with the Mac Daddy of holidays.  The one that just, like, blows any other holiday away.  Well, Ramadan's fun.  You don't eat for 40 days.  That's a fucking hot time.  And the Jews have a bunch of fun ones.  You'd grieve and cry and apologize for a week.  Yeah, a bunch of guilt.  Guilt holidays.  And that fasting holiday, you don't see us jumping on the bandwagon because, say, it's not a good holiday. 
[01:07:30]  No.  Come on.  You can have that Ramadan.  We don't give a fuck.  Eating matzah.  What's that one?  Awful.  Passover.  Yeah.  You've got to eat the unleavened bread, and so we're not trying to weasel in on that one.  Yeah, we don't give a crap.  Leave our Christmas alone.  And she said it's a politically charged...  It's not...  What's politically charged about calling it a Christmas tree?  It's just people...  It's just a tree.  Shut up.  It's a Christmas tree.  Just let it be.  Holiday tree for everybody, field included. 
[01:08:00]  Holiday tree.  Pretty soon the only sport that we're going to be allowed to play is soccer.  Why?  Because everyone just wins and plays, and you don't even know who...  It's worldwide kind of thing.  And you don't even know who the real star on the team is, because they're all just very  equal out there, just kicking the ball around.  We are fucking finished as a society.  We stink.  Boston is...  And I get bashed sometimes for bashing Boston so much, but there you go. 
[01:08:30]  There's another one.  There you go.  I know that the Christmas tree here in New York City is still called the Christmas tree.  It's the lighting of the Christmas tree.  It's not a holiday tree.  But up there, for some reason, they buckled under to some kind of...  What?  What'd they get?  One letter?  Probably.  And it's Boston.  If they want to be so politically correct, why don't they open the gates that surround  Roxbury and let them run free in Newton?  Let the drawbridge down. 
[01:09:00]  Let the drawbridge down.  The most racist city in America.  You find me a city that's more racist than Boston, but they're going to go after the  holiday tree.  They're going to call it the holiday tree instead of the Christmas tree.  We are lighting the holiday tree.  Oof.  All these do-gooders.  All these do-gooders you hated in high school.  Now they're like controlling the world.  Because there's probably one little group, but it's like, can't people just be offended  and take it like, sorry you're offended? 
[01:09:30]  We have to fucking bend and grovel just so somebody's not upset by something.  Why do they have to be offended?  And how come their being offended doesn't re-offend people that celebrate Christmas and want to  call it a Christmas tree?  Hey listen, I don't think we should call it Martin Luther King's birthday, because that's  too specific to blacks.  How about just a civil rights day?  Yeah.  Let's just call it civil rights day.  Let's do that.  Let's do that, because you're offending anyone who isn't black and didn't, uh... 
[01:10:00]  Right.  Well, maybe the Klan's offended.  People in the Klan are offended that his birthday is being celebrated, so how about just a guy  day?  How about guy day?  That's just stupid.  Yeah.  We get penalized for coming up with the greatest holiday ever.  You find one that matches Christmas.  Not gonna find it.  Nope.  It's such a jolly time.  I love the Jews with their Hanukkah bushes.  Has anyone seen a Hanukkah bush? 
[01:10:30]  Man, if that's not showing jealousy for our holiday...  Have you ever seen one?  Have you ever seen one at a Jewish person's house?  A Hanukkah bush?  A Hanukkah bush.  Isn't it a Christmas tree?  You always got the menorah.  That's in the window.  What do they call that?  I don't know.  Did they have a menorah in Boston?  I don't know.  Somewhere in Newton?  They put the menorah?  It's just one of the things that is pissing us off today.  What a dumb, dumb thing that Boston's doing.  Enough with the political correctness. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  We love expressing ourselves as human beings.  Stop it.  And sometimes we're gonna express ourselves in some ugly ways.  People don't want us to be different, either.  Like, there's no...  Everyone wants everybody to be the same.  Well, no, no, no.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  No, no.  If you're on the RCon line, and you want to have the sign-in screens, we have the one that's  sports-oriented, we have the one that's news-oriented, and then there's black voices.  So that's okay to be separated. 
[01:11:30]  When you're a minority group and you want to be separated, it's okay.  But if the majority wants to separate you, they're all racists or homophobes or sexists.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's how it works.  But if we're a minority group, and it's in our best interest to be separated, then we're  separated.  Yeah.  Until you want to be...  Wait, AOL's using black voices at the sign-in screens?  Well, there's one of four sign-in screens you can choose, and one of them, these groveling  motherfuckers put black voices.  So what is that all about? 
[01:12:00]  What if you want something else?  What if you want, I don't know, you're Polish.  You want the Polish one.  No, only Spanish and black.  Oh, they got Spanish?  Yeah.  They won't have white voices, powerful, beautiful voices.  White voices.  Yeah, that probably wouldn't be a very enchanting sign-in screen.  What par?  What par?  Teen People, that magazine Teen People, getting in a little bit of heat about those two little,  those two cute little girls.  Oh, the white supremacists.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What, Prussian Blue? 
[01:12:30]  Prussian Blue, sure.  The little, have you seen this, Jimmy?  Sure have.  I was here with you.  Little girls.  I never know when you're here anymore.  We don't know when you're here anymore.  But I was, guys.  We have no idea what bits we did with you.  You didn't even call me.  You didn't even call me, Jimmy.  Jimmy's defending himself a lot the last two days.  I was here for that bit.  We don't know.  But no, I don't want you guys to have to explain it, because then you, like, you know,  I was over here.  I was like, yeah, no, I remember I was there.  I don't want you to have to...  We did save one of our best bits for you to, from when you came back, which is this week.  Where is it?  Well, while you look, they're doing this story in Teen People on racism, I guess. 
[01:13:00]  And racism and entertainment.  So they're doing an interview with these two.  And people are a little upset that they're giving them any time at all, because they're  saying they're more dangerous than skinheads, these two girls, because they're so adorable.  They're like little, they're like puggles with training bras, aren't they?  They're the cutest little things.  And they sing horrible racist songs. 
[01:13:30]  And they're getting the word out to the little teens out there through their horrible music,  by the way, because they can't sing.  If they could sing, they'd be powerhouses.  It's funny, because the media just stinks, because they make believe when they do stories  like this, like, look at how outrageous this is.  I can't believe this is going on.  And they're turning on so many people to this that would have never been turned on to it  if they weren't doing their stupid story.  60 Minutes or 20-20 or whatever the hell.  One of them, yeah.  What show is it on Sunday nights? 
[01:14:00]  60 Minutes.  60 Minutes.  They took on the whole online gambling thing that's becoming a huge issue, right?  Yeah.  And basically turning on people how you could online gamble now.  This is how simple it is to open an account.  Right.  First, go to this site.  Right.  Now type in your credit card number.  We're going to show you how easy it is to gamble online.  Put the money that you want to gamble.  Now hit enter.  You're ready to gamble.  Did you see that?  I am.  You saw that story Sunday? 
[01:14:30]  No.  Pretty much just explaining to the kids and everyone else out there that this is happening  and this is how easy it is.  Thank you.  These are the parts of a hydrogen bomb.  Easily obtained and put together.  First, take the core.  Now put it in.  That's how they do the news.  And they tell the little instructions.  And they do the story like this is an outrage and this should not be happening.  But it's backfiring because they're turning more people on to online gambling.  Look how easy rape is.  Know what I like?  I'm in this dark hallway as this unsuspecting woman is coming up the stairway. 
[01:15:00]  Watch how easy.  I pull her panties off.  I look like a fireman.  Shut the fuck up, bitch.  Shut the fuck up.  I came.  Now I'm gone.  And they act like they're doing good out there.  They're not doing good.  No.  Sensationalism.  But these online gambling sites, if you go to like .com, that's where you're just kind  of learning how to play cards and gamble and stuff with fake money. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  But if you go to the same website and put in .net, that's where the action is.  Where the action is.  I had no idea until I saw the story on Sunday.  That's how it was.  Yeah.  They push.  How they were getting around the laws.  They push like party poker during the, when they show on the poker on TV.  Yeah.  And it says, not a gambling site, just play money, blah, blah, blah, whatever.  And it's .net or .com.  I'm not sure which one.  But then you put in the other thing, .com, and there you go. 
[01:16:00]  Full gambling.  I had no idea because they're like, how are these companies allowed to advertise as much  as they are?  And they explain why.  Because the website they're advertising is legal.  It's the legal one.  Because you're just practicing and you're using fake money and all that crap.  But the other one is the .com one or the .net one.  Well, whatever, yeah.  And that's all you have to do to switch over to real money.  Because the logos look exactly the same, too.  And the tables and everything.  But 60 Minutes is doing this story, like, you know, and I'm thinking to myself, how many  people are being turned on to how this works now? 
[01:16:30]  Thank you, 60 Minutes.  Thank you.  All right.  Today Show Audio, dead body exhibit.  This is the exhibit I saw in Philly over the weekend.  Yes.  And now they had a couple of these dead bodies on the Today Show.  We should throw that video up on opianthony.com because people are still trying to, you know,  visualize what this looks like, this whole process.  And they had one just sitting right next to Matt and Katie pretty much.  Not next to them.  That would have been cool.  They had them in a chair in a distance.  Yeah, it was kind of far away.  It should have been between them.  They didn't want to buddy up to us. 
[01:17:00]  It should have been between them.  So we got some audio.  These are real.  What?  Go ahead.  Just picturing them between them.  Just the little banter they'd have.  Put your hand on his knee.  How you doing there, champ?  Looks like you after a few drinks.  They laugh.  They elbow it.  Looks like he's having a rough day.  Didn't get enough sleep less.  Oh, shut up.  Old Kennedy head.  All right, here's some audio from the Today Show. 
[01:17:30]  Cole Porter may have written, I've got you under my skin, but have you ever really thought about what's underneath yours?  Well, a controversial exhibit now here in New York City can help answer that and other questions about the human body in a very unique way.  It's putting dead bodies on display.  We should warn you, some of the images in this story may be a bit disturbing.  May be disturbing.  It's an anatomy textbook come alive, so to speak. 
[01:18:00]  22 human bodies, along with 260 organs and other preserved body parts, making up a new educational experience called What Else But Bodies?  I'm in shock and in awe.  Through nine galleries, the interactive exhibit explains not only the parts, but the systems that keep your body alive.  The skeletal, the muscular, circulatory, each vitally important and interconnected.  The body is the one thing you carry with you from the time you're born until the time you breathe your last breath. 
[01:18:30]  It's the most practical information that a person could want to know and understand.  All right, so there's some audio.  You know what would be great?  Just, are they roped off in any way, or are they just kind of there?  Oh, you can touch them.  Well, I don't think they want you touching them, but they're right there to touch.  Just start fucking one.  Just get up behind one and start fucking it.  Would you start yelling at us?  And whoever comes over, just go, look, I know him. 
[01:19:00]  He owed me money.  Right.  A wow sticker on the hand of one of those bodies.  Hey, ooh.  The specimens are preserved through a technique that can take as long as a year.  Some are frozen in motion, skinless cadavers posing as athletes, a body holding hands with  its own removed skeleton.  There's also a section to scare you straight, showing the effects of disease, like a smoker's  blackened lungs.  Not really grossed out, a little bit like, well, that's interesting. 
[01:19:30]  Critics question the ethics of displaying the death for profit.  Human rights groups are concerned that the bodies, all on loan from a university in China,  may have been illegally obtained.  But organizers say their goal is to educate, not simply make money, and insist the bodies  come from legitimate sources.  Yeah, I'm very comfortable with the way they were obtained, and quite frankly, we wouldn't  be involved if they weren't obtained in a legal manner. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah, they're very comfortable because no one's talking.  How do they keep track of where those bodies come from, from China?  Just stop it.  Why do you think they're removing the skin so you can't figure out who it is?  Figure out who the fuck it is.  You wouldn't be able to anyway.  You are...  China.  You are...  Good news.  You travel to America.  And finally, some cute banter going back and forth with the flying TV host. 
[01:20:30]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Oh, wait.  Big Kev wrote a note.  He cut his brain.  From Planet of the Apes.  Are you ready?  Go ahead.  Wanted you to buckle up.  Wait, wait, wait.  Sorry. 
[01:21:00]  Got it.  Thank you, Big Kev the Joke Man.  All right.  All right, we get it.  All right, we get it.  Finally, this.  You know, I have mixed feelings about it, but I took the girls to the Franklin Institute  in Philadelphia, and I think they, it was pretty fascinating.  I just wonder about the people.  Do they realize when they donate their bodies or where they get these cadavers that they're  actually going to be on display?  Because there was like a mother and a father and a small child where they were showing the 
[01:21:30]  nerve endings, and it just, I don't know, it made me wonder how they would feel.  I mean, it's all polymer preservation, and you're right, you have to worry about, wonder  about the human stories behind the bodies, but this is, it's an amazing technique when  it comes right down to it.  Yeah, there you have.  Liquid silicone.  Yeah.  There's the thinker over there.  Yeah.  And the black lung corpses are really interesting, too, and a good warning for people about smoking.  I don't know, on a weekend, maybe Six Flags for me. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, that's a doozy.  Oh, boy.  That's a doozy.  Oh, that's why he's paid the big bucks.  I got it.  Six Flags is a bit of that.  Oh, wow.  That's a funny one.  Wow.  He's quick on his feet, isn't he?  That guy's good, man.  He's good.  He's good, you. 
[01:22:30]  Let's say hi to Kip in New Paltz.  Kip?  Yo, what's up, man?  Hey, Kip.  So, listen, you got to know, get back on track, and you have to talk about the icy hot  on the balls before.  Oh, yeah.  I was in high school, triple sessions one day, and I took a real bad hit to the inside  of my side.  So, get home that night, and I start, you know, putting some icy hot or whatever it was  at the time on there.  And I don't know if I went to take a leak or something, but I got some on my nuts, and  it was killer, bro.  It was like the worst thing ever. 
[01:23:00]  So, I run in the kitchen, and I hop up on the counter, and I'm using a sprayer on the  kitchen sink, you know, trying to spray my nuts off.  Uh-oh.  In the front door, I walked my aunt and uncle, with my balls hanging in the kitchen sink,  spraying it.  Uh, not a good sight.  Uh, a little explaining to do for them.  Didn't that hurt even more, though?  Uh, no.  It was kind of refreshing, to tell you the truth, because it was pretty damn hot.  All right.  So, letting you guys know, these boys ran for some awesome pain. 
[01:23:30]  All right.  Thank you, Kip.  Yeah, man.  Faithful listener to the show here, Nate in Brooklyn.  Nate.  Good morning, guys.  Hey, Nate.  Yeah, I just want to take issue with you guys.  You guys are really misrepresenting what this whole religious display thing is about.  And I agree, there are some people that say, yeah, you can't have any religious display,  period.  I don't care what happens.  But the most, the majority of people who are objecting to this are doing it because  they're spending tax dollars on it, and that's the problem.  You're right.  If it was, if it's privately sponsored, no problem.  But if it's going to be tax dollars, now you get into a whole thing, because the Muslims 
[01:24:00]  want their thing, and the Jews want their thing.  That's the problem.  We've been doing this with tax dollars for many, many years, and no one spoke up.  Yeah.  Why now?  Why now?  Why do we have to include everybody?  OB, you're 100% wrong.  There have been religious groups that have been objecting to this since the 18th century.  The Jehovah's Witnesses were objecting to this hundreds of years ago.  They're kooks.  And you know what?  We had people in place that heard all that crap and just went, shut up.  Yeah.  Back in the old, yeah, shut up days. 
[01:24:30]  Right, but that's exactly the issue that why people are getting all upset today.  They're saying you're taking tax dollars to promote one particular religion.  Let's not kid ourselves.  They're not promoting the religion, dude.  It's just a tradition, dude.  It's a tradition.  A Christmas tree is a Christian symbol.  It is a Christian symbol, but you know what?  It's about a fucking fat douche in a red outfit with a beard.  No one is promoting Christ on the cross.  Right, but then why can't you just put the menorah up and put the Muslims are going to say,  I want to have...  Because, you know, I'll tell you what.  You know why? 
[01:25:00]  Because it's not as popular.  That's the problem.  Because we came up with the greatest holiday ever.  Why are we being penalized?  Okay, but there's a constitution also.  There's a First Amendment which prohibits the government from endorsing...  They called them Christmas trees back then.  You think Honest Abe dragged in the holiday tree?  It was a Christmas tree.  I'm not saying it didn't happen.  That doesn't make it right.  I guarantee you, good old Abe Lincoln used the N-word as well.  The problem is the tax dollars.  If they don't spend tax dollars on it, no one's going to say... 
[01:25:30]  Who are you kidding?  We do know that, too.  But how about the fact that in public schools,  now they teach stuff about Islam in certain schools,  you know, just to kind of, like, diffuse how they've been behaving?  No, I don't disagree that there's problems in the public school.  And the public school system, of course, is also supported by tax dollars.  And I don't disagree.  No, I agree with you.  I'm agreeing with you.  And that's the problem.  They're completely dishonest on that side.  But when you're talking about that one issue,  and the issue really is that they're spending tax dollars on it, 
[01:26:00]  and that's why people get all riled up.  They say, hey, if you're going to spend tax dollars on this,  you've got to spend it on my stuff.  But, Nate, we've just got to stop.  This political correctness is out of hand.  Don't you understand that?  You're completely ignoring the whole point.  That's right.  That's right.  Nate, no one's ignoring the point.  Your point is right.  That is why there's a problem with it.  But it's like, who gives a shit?  Do they have to buckle every time with something so unimportant as a stupid Christmas tree?  Is that weird?  And Christmas has nothing to do with religion these days.  Hold on a second, Jim.  If there was a small town that had a predominantly Muslim population, 
[01:26:30]  they'd say, you know what, we're going to put up this symbol to some jihadist  that we feel was some symbolic guy to our religion.  People would be up in arms, and rightly so.  But the difference between a jihadist and a fictional character, Santa Claus.  What if it's just some old Muslim guy with a big sword,  and they want to put the religion up there to some Muslim guy?  First of all, where were Muslims?  This has not been happening in this country for 200 years. 
[01:27:00]  It's just a tradition.  Jim, I'm telling you, you're wrong.  And Christmas has nothing to do with religion.  Beat them down and tell them to go fuck themselves.  If Muslims weren't behaving the way they have been lately,  I wouldn't have a problem with it if they weren't misbehaving so much.  No, I mean, I believe you wouldn't,  because, I mean, you're pretty honest with this type of stuff,  and I know you don't personally care,  but you can't imagine that if there was some town in the middle of Kansas somewhere,  and it was predominantly Muslim,  and they wanted to put up all sorts of Muslim crap everywhere,  at taxpayer expense, which would include the local Christian community, 
[01:27:30]  they wouldn't want to, and rightly so.  Fuck them.  Fuck them.  How about in fucking Miami?  Dude, how about in Miami or everywhere in this stupid country,  in predominantly Spanish areas, everything has been switched over to Spanish.  I know that's not like a religious issue.  Exactly.  That's the difference.  There's nothing in the Constitution about ethnicity.  I understand that, dude.  I know that, but it's still irritating,  and it's just buckling under a pressure and a fear of offending somebody.  No, 100%.  The political correctness has gotten completely out of line,  but the reason the courts take the whole religious issue seriously 
[01:28:00]  is because that's the first amendment.  I mean, that's the first one.  That's the first amendment.  I mean, you can't spend the tax dollars on it.  If they really don't want to make an issue out of it,  have it privately sponsored by a church,  lease it to the church group for the holiday season.  Oh, stop.  It's not always about the church.  All right, Nate.  They've tied Christmas into the church thing.  It's two separate things.  There's the religious Christmas and the celebratory Christmas.  Some people are atheists and celebrate Christmas as a holiday  that has nothing to do with Jesus.  100%. 
[01:28:30]  And it's still a Christmas.  It's a Christmas tree.  Right.  It's not a holiday tree.  But, Anthony, you've got to be honest.  But Christmas, if you're going to relate it to a religion,  it has nothing to do with any other religion except Christianity.  No one's thinking about it as a religion.  But who doesn't?  You're telling me people don't celebrate Christmas as a religious holiday?  They do.  I know you're saying that they put it up.  Not a lot of people.  In a secular way.  But the bottom line is, it's a Christian holiday.  And that's why people are getting all upset.  And they're spending tax dollars on it.  And they're taking everyone's tax dollars. 
[01:29:00]  It's the head muckety-muck holiday around this time of year.  And everyone wants to pile on.  And I say, fuck them.  It's Christmas.  All right, Nate.  Nate, Nate, Nate.  Thank you.  And if you can take that attitude, you can't be surprised when people are going to get  all up and off.  No, I can be.  And I know you're right where you're coming from.  I'm not saying you're wrong.  But it's just annoying that they constantly buckle to that.  And then the Constitution, I don't know.  I don't think that's what the Constitution was designed for.  Of course it wasn't.  It was to keep a bunch of Muslims and Jews and other people happy because there's a big  tree up.  Who gives a shit?  No, don't. 
[01:29:30]  But the compromise has to be no tax dollars spent.  And then the people on the other side, the left, can't get upset when it's purely symbolic  being sponsored privately.  Well, tax dollars are being spent in other religious areas, which are, to me, much more  offensive than a stupid tree which people come and look at.  Exactly.  I think that would be offensive to you, not necessarily to the people who want it.  No, no, no.  I mean like Islam being taught in schools and all these stupid...  I agree with you 100% there.  All right, Nate.  Thank you.  Take care, guys.  There you go.  Hey, it raises a good point.  Tax dollars.  I don't want to call it the holiday tree. 
[01:30:00]  I don't either, but...  Tax dollars.  I guess he makes a good point.  Should we do the icy hot thing next?  Of course.  Okay.  We'll do that next.  Ladies and gentlemen, the one, the only, Sandy Kane.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, oh, ow.  Oh, ow.  Oh, ow.  Oh, ow.  Ow, ow.  Ow, ow.  Ow, ow.  Ow, ow.  Ow, ow.  Ow, ow. 
[01:30:30]  Ow, ow, ow.  Ow, ow.  Ow, ow.  Ow, ow.  Thanks.  Ow, ow, ow.  Thanks.  Ladies and gentlemen, joining Sandy Kane, Mr. James. 
[01:31:00]  Wrạnh.  Ow.  Oh.  Oh, ow, ow.  точки Ya.  I don't want to call it.  Whoa.  Oh, ow.  Oh.  Oh, ow.  Oh, ow.  One.  What?  Oh, ow. 
[01:31:30]  Oh, ow.  Oh, ow.  Oh, ow.  Oh, ow.  Oh, ow.  I don't play it.  I'm playing it.  I'm playing it.  I'm playing it.  I'm playing it.  Hey, hey.  Hey, hey.  Thanks.  Oh, ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Oh, ow.  I'm playing it. 
[01:32:00]  Drink a six pack, turn off the lights,  and smoke some crack. I'm beautiful.  You're a filthy whore!  I don't look like that.  That should be a problem.  This thing has been falling out for a while. 
[01:32:30]  Alright, we're back with the Opie and Anthony program  on XM Satellite Radio.  Big hi to everyone listening to us on DirecTV, Anthony.  Yes.  We're hearing from some old fans.  Uh-huh.  I read an instant feedback earlier today,  and it was a guy who...  in Vegas, I think.  Was it Vegas?  Yeah.  We were actually on in Vegas on regular radio.  Remember that?  Yeah.  XM Satellite Radio. 
[01:33:00]  He had DirecTV.  And found us by accident.  Just flipping around.  Liked what he heard.  He was actually gonna buy a Sirius satellite.  He was under some misconception that it was good.  Mm-hmm.  And now he said, fuck that.  I'm getting XM.  There you go.  Directly linked to DirecTV.  Another XM sub.  That's very true.  Because, like, a lot of times I listen to XM, and I'm like, fuck, man.  I miss commercials.  You know? 
[01:33:30]  And they're gonna be putting them in, which is really good.  Because Mel did a great job when he was over with the commercial radio.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, the big mistake they're doing is just turning it into a radio company.  Yeah.  It's so stupid.  Yeah, that's what they're doing.  It's not gonna be anything different than regular radio.  Mel's known to be a guy who sells, sells, sells.  It's all about the bottom line, the money.  They gotta recoup a lot of this money that they're pumping out,  that they're hemorrhaging.  And they're gonna do it, and he's even said it, they're gonna do it through sales.  He's hiring salespeople that he used to be buddies with at Infinity. 
[01:34:00]  Mm-hmm.  And they're gonna treat this like regular radio.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, he says, oh, the spot loads aren't gonna be as big as they were when Howard was on broadcast.  Eh, probably to start.  I'll give him that.  There's gonna be quite a few.  But then, eventually, it's gonna get there.  It's gonna get to be loads of commercials.  Have fun with them.  This is an entertainment company, XM.  XM.  Yeah.  It really is.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  The big mistake you make is turning it into a pure radio company. 
[01:34:30]  Radio.  Because there's a bunch of radio guys out there that stink.  So now you're gonna bring them to satellite radio.  Just because they're radio people.  And now they're gonna be better.  Why?  Mm-hmm.  They're gonna bring some radio talent aboard.  But in general, you gotta think outside the box.  And that's why we love being here.  XM thinks outside the box.  Big time.  You gotta bring in people that aren't your basic radio people.  Mm-hmm.  Got a little something extra.  So how do people feel about the meeting with Ted the enemy?  Ted the enemy? 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  The arch enemy?  Yeah.  Ted?  Yeah.  Ted.  Am I missing some?  Yeah.  You're not getting the whole throw everyone off the fucking line thing?  Jesus.  Eat your cereal and let the men talk.  Oh.  We're not dating.  Why'd you kick me under the table?  No.  No.  No.  People are all pissed off about the arch enemy thing.  Yeah.  They are so pissed.  I know. 
[01:35:30]  But if you don't know by now, you're fucking retarded.  Yeah.  Oh, you're not announcing it, right?  You're severely retarded.  No, I didn't announce it.  I got them right where I want them.  Enough shit has been thrown out there where you should absolutely know who it is.  If you're still bitching, because I got people on instant feedback going,  you motherfuckers are making us sit here and not know who the arch enemy is.  You're a retard if you don't know who it is right now.  I actually gave out initials on Friday.  Of course.  Everything was given out.  That had nothing to do with anything.  Yeah.  Oh, was that it? 
[01:36:00]  People were speculating whether it was a famous author coming aboard.  Or a famous comedian.  Yeah.  C.O.B.  Mm-hmm.  It's Caroline's on Broadway.  It's actually...  When is this for Saturday?  Yeah.  Where Jimmy's going, I'm going to be there.  I'm appearing.  Caroline's on Broadway.  It's on Broadway.  Did I say that?  Your friggin' spots for where you're going to be are either disgusting or paint you as  a lunatic.  And you're both of those things, so they're very accurate. 
[01:36:30]  A lot of instant feedback coming in about these shows coming up.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, really?  A couple of them are sold out.  I think two of them are completely sold and two were about 15 tickets away, so...  That's it?  Yeah.  I'll be there Saturday, Jimmy, to support you.  Okay.  Alright.  Kiss, kiss.  Okay, why don't we do the Icy Hot thing?  Please.  We got the two PSPs.  We should bring the boys in.  So, Ray's going to be the spotter.  And we went with a different type of Icy Hot? 
[01:37:00]  Why did we go with the tube kind?  Because it was easier to get out than the other one.  Easier to spread.  Alright, we got four guys, Anthony.  Four men.  Young go-getters.  Men.  If you're just tuning in, we're going to do an Icy Hot contest, and the last two guys  in studio win the PSPs.  Alright.  Right.  We have Danny.  Say hi, Danny.  Hi.  We have Nathaniel.  Hi.  How's it going?  We have Travis.  Hello.  Oh, Travis is so out first. 
[01:37:30]  No, I'm very confident.  You think?  You're very confident?  Why?  I just think I can handle this thing.  Someone on the phone lines is saying that the guy with the most ball bag hair is going  to win.  Why?  Less hits your ball bag?  You got protection.  Is it gay if I said we just had this conversation in the studio?  Oh, really?  So we kind of took that into account and have all decided that we probably don't have a  big foresty bag to the point where it's going to affect this competition. 
[01:38:00]  Let's take a look.  Who would you put?  I would put in hair order, I would put Danny the most hair, then Than, and then Lil Travis.  I don't know.  And we'll never know.  Actually, Travis has a lot of facial hair.  Yeah, he's got those bushy sideburns.  He looks so young, I bet you his hasn't even dropped yet.  It's just like a little sack.  It's empty.  Empty little sack.  Alright, I guess Ray has to come in here for this. 
[01:38:30]  Are these guys going down to their underwear?  How are we working this?  We don't trust each other.  Huh?  Well, is E-Rock playing?  Yeah, E-Rock's playing.  I'm going to spot her.  Ooh.  A lot of aggression towards E-Rock.  Yeah, well.  Well, no one really likes E-Rock.  Why?  I don't know.  Just because of that dumb shaved face?  It's really bugging me.  I like you unshaven and messy.  Not chipper.  Alright, well. 
[01:39:00]  Well, are we ready?  Down in your underwear, boys.  Ooh.  This is just the worst.  That's the worst.  No, it's not.  A bunch of men standing there in their underwear putting stuff on their balls.  It's called a contest.  It's called a contest.  It's called a contest.  And it makes me sick that you guys have fucking chicks squirting all over the place and then  I come back and you've got these fannets in their undershorts.  I know.  It's not right.  Well, Kevin from Colorado has a good point on the phones.  Uh, Kevin?  Yeah. 
[01:39:30]  Hi, guys.  How's it going?  Hey, Kevin.  How you doing, Kev?  Thanks for calling the program.  Oh, thank you.  I just wanted to say we definitely know Jimmy's back in town because instead of hot chicks,  you know, squirting on Big A, we got guys in the studio rubbing icey out on their ball  bag.  Good choice, bro.  Believe me.  Punch it out.  All right.  Okay.  Well, we're ready to go, guys.  Um, you want them to apply every two minutes because we don't want to sit around for five  minutes.  Eef. 
[01:40:00]  I, uh, should we do other body parts?  Ugh.  Yeah, how about a dollop in the old asshole, tough guys?  How about a finger full right on the old brown eye?  Tough guys.  You want to be men.  That's what we do to be men.  You put a whole thing right up your ass with a little icy hot on it.  Timmy's energy always gets picked up when, to a new level when we do these weird things.  Yeah.  Well, you can hear it in your voice.  Well, dude, we were just talking before about the holiday tree, and now there's four guys  about to fucking scald their own testicles for a fucking PSP game. 
[01:40:30]  How do you not get juiced?  Steve?  Sorry.  Are they going to dip in water too, Ant?  Uh, I think, I think, uh, after a while.  Yeah.  It's not looking like they're suffering.  All right.  Maybe a little water in there, because I think that activates a little more.  All right.  So, what's, uh.  All right, uh.  Oof.  You gave us the order, Ant.  Gentlemen, apply to your bags.  No, wow. 
[01:41:00]  Flip it up.  Give it a container.  All right.  Um, waiting for Eric.  You guys should do it all at the same time, because that could be key to the contest.  Let's walk on the test.  I don't know.  Getting a cup of water.  Oh, yeah, you're right, because that would be whoever goes last.  Yeah.  Yeah, they all gotta do it at the same time.  Uh, who went out and got, uh, more containers?  Do they like toothpaste containers?  I do.  Oh, that's probably more easily applied.  Yeah, that stuff goes on a lot easier.  It's like toothpaste consistency.  All right, who's gonna, uh, who's gonna dish out the Icy Hot?  Icy Hot. 
[01:41:30]  There's two fingers first.  We're going on Travis's, uh, fingers.  Oh, my God.  That much?  Yeah.  It's gotta be a lot.  It's gotta be a lot.  It's gotta be a lot.  Yeah, Kev.  That much.  Kev, use your hand.  Just put it, like, on your fingers and just put it on your balls.  Make sure it's the same amount.  Is it about the same?  It's about the same.  It looks like Travis got a little more.  Yeah, it looks like I got some more.  Yeah.  A little more for Than.  A little more for Than.  There it is.  Hold on, Danny.  Fucking all eager.  Danny.  Little.  Oh, Danny's got a lot.  All right.  Ray, the intern, has to kinda make sure they're actually applying. 
[01:42:00]  No cheating.  Yeah, don't cheat, man.  Don't cheat.  Now, that's gotta be wiped.  And you gotta kinda rub it in a little bit, guys.  Don't just leave it there as a swipe.  You gotta get your, uh, I think you gotta get the palm of your hand involved.  Once you wipe it on your bag, give it like a rant rant like you're shining a doorknob.  Uh, and then you'll be done.  Yes.  This is for the PSP, remember.  Yes.  Make sure you massage those balls good. 
[01:42:30]  Yes.  That's right.  Rub it in there.  Good ones.  What exactly is Ray?  Make believe you're throwing a spitball.  I'm looking at it when we're doing this.  What?  He's kinda just making sure your hands are in the right spot.  Yeah.  Your fingers are not wiping it on your thigh.  He wants to make sure you're going inside your underwear.  Inside your underwear.  Yeah.  You're not wiping it on your underwear.  Right.  Yeah.  You know, you're not wiping it on your side as you're trying to fake it.  That's right.  Gotcha.  No cheating.  If we find out you're cheating, um, be angry.  Well, then Jimmy's gonna paddle you.  That's right. 
[01:43:00]  You get a good paddling.  You did say, uh, you will paddle if, uh, if they were bad.  Huh?  Yes, Travis.  We're all doing it at the same time.  How's Ray gonna watch all of us?  Well, Kevin will be watching, too.  Look, why?  Are you saying that you're gonna cheat?  No, I'm definitely not.  Then who are you thinking is gonna cheat?  Eric is gonna cheat.  They all think Eric's gonna cheat.  I think Eric's gonna cheat, too.  Me, too.  Who do you guys don't trust in the contest?  Who are gonna cheat?  Everyone's playing Eric.  Everyone's playing Eric.  They hate Eric.  Because you cheated to win $100,000.  Exactly.  Eric, don't worry.  It's okay to be hated.  You're already mushing it around in your hand to try to activate it. 
[01:43:30]  I'm working up a good lather.  You're cute.  He's activating it.  Alright, drop the mic and apply, I guess.  Apply to your bags.  Get those bags out, studs.  Fucking hot chips are not here.  I get these.  Look at what you get.  And Steve is videotaping, so...  You're gonna have to maybe through the top.  I don't know what Dan's doing.  He's gonna try to get it through his fly.  You have to, because you're gonna rub it over the helmet the other way.  No, you gotta get it through the top of your pants, I think.  No way. 
[01:44:00]  You get the balls out the bottom.  You never get it in there.  You take your balls out the bottom.  Would you actually go...  Do you want to go over your fucking shaft and helmet with that stuff on your hands?  If you pull your underwear and pants away from you far enough, you're gonna be able to get in there.  That's how they...  That's what you guys gotta do.  Danny's just, like, doesn't care.  Danny's got his pants open.  Danny's got his pants open.  And then just, yeah, get it on there.  Get it on there.  Alright, where do you want to look?  Whenever you guys are ready.  I'm trying not to, but I wanna make sure you're not fucking cheating.  Yeah, sure, that's what you're doing.  Are we doing this on my head?  Yeah.  Alright, are we ready to apply? 
[01:44:30]  We need to rub it in and...  Well, just give it a nice, just give it a good...  Wipe on.  So it's on there, good, not like hanging off your sack.  Get it all off your hands.  In ten seconds.  Yeah, get it all off your hands.  Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, apply!  Oh, Jesus.  Contest on.  Oh, Jesus.  Can't wait till later when Jimmy's upper lip smells like I see hot.  Now, wait a minute.  I don't like the implication. 
[01:45:00]  Alright.  Alright, it looks like...  Alright, they're rubbing.  That looks pretty authentic.  Alright, Travis has come out with an empty hand.  Their hands are pretty clean.  There it goes.  Alright, is it icy yet, guys?  It's hot.  Very.  It's getting hot already?  Yeah.  Alright, let's get some mics over there.  Yeah, Kevin, why don't you work the mics for us, please?  Big Cav or Steve, somebody.  Uh, what are you feeling?  Oh, fuck.  Burning sensation?  Nice. 
[01:45:30]  Burning sensation.  Holy shit.  Get in the bag and get the holy shit out of that.  Ray, open the door.  Wow.  It stinks.  Hawk is really having a tough time.  He's turning red.  Hawk?  It's burning.  I'm gonna pee myself.  Yeah.  It almost feels like you've already pissed your pants.  Yeah.  Oh, look at Travis scratching the back of his neck.  I might have to tap out.  Yeah!  Oh, my God.  Wow.  They're all doing the pee pee dance.  They're all like...  Alright, the Icy Hot has been on for one minute at this time. 
[01:46:00]  Who wants to tap out, man?  That bathroom's waiting.  You can wipe it down and...  Paper towel.  Is it really that bad?  It's burning.  It's awful.  Hawk is hyperventilating.  Why don't you act like men?  Travis is spinning in circles.  Yeah, get a mic on Travis.  What's up?  Ugh.  I'm just trying not to think about it.  What, the fucking agony on your bag right now?  Ugh.  Ugh.  You guys talk...  Wow, Danny, I've never seen him look like that.  Danny's focused.  He's really trying to... 
[01:46:30]  Danny's trying to go into his own.  Yeah.  Trying to not think about this.  Eric's shaking, too, now.  They don't want to talk.  It hurts so much.  What does it feel like, Eric?  Does it feel like the beard stubble of an uncle?  Eric?  It feels like there's a lighter right under you.  That bad?  It's burning.  Wow.  Holy crap, look at these guys.  They're losing their minds.  Yeah.  Travis, you alright?  Just say something for the radio audience.  I'm good. 
[01:47:00]  Alright.  It smells so minty in here.  Nathaniel?  I'm dying.  Nathaniel's dying?  Who's gonna tap out?  Who's tapping out?  Who's tapping out?  Who's tapping out?  Two minutes.  Oh yeah, we gotta start applying more.  I like five.  Huh?  Five?  Five minutes?  No, not yet, not yet.  Now this is for real.  Travis is like, not yet, not yet.  Oh wait, what?  I'm getting all tingling and passing out feeling.  Yeah.  Oh no!  Travis is out!  Have somebody assist him so he doesn't just fall on the bathroom floor. 
[01:47:30]  Have somebody fucking hide the paper towels in there.  Just make sure, he said he was feeling like he was tingling and ready to pass out.  He did not like that at all, man.  No.  He was having a really tough time.  Wow.  Steve is videotaping this.  We just need one guy to drop out and the other two get the PSP.  Sam looks a little pale.  Dan, how you doing over there?  Danny's being quiet.  Good.  Alright.  He's using the Master Poe thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are you taking your pulse?  He's squeezing his...  Eric? 
[01:48:00]  Oh, moving sucks.  Moving sucks.  Moving sucks.  They're trying to stay still.  The dance stinks.  Huh?  Dancing around does not help.  Well, that was a good thing you told us because you know what the next step is?  Jumping jacks!  A little exercise.  A little running in place.  Just fucking tap out, pussy, so we can get these fucking things.  Danny's an animal.  Danny is an animal.  Danny is doing okay.  Yeah, Danny's not doing bad at all.  Eric, why are you suffering?  Look at Danny.  Danny's not going anywhere.  It's very obvious.  Money bags. 
[01:48:30]  Tap out.  Sing it out.  Sing it out, Hawk.  You can do it.  Alright.  Don't let these two...  They're trying to punk you because you're rich and spoiled and had a great...  You guys now, ten squats.  Ten squats.  You've got to go down, bend at the knee, all the way down, and then back up all at the  same time.  Or do we go with another dollop?  Well, ten squats first.  Yeah, a couple of squats.  This is when they're moving.  It really hurts.  Alright.  Ready?  Alright.  Ready and down.  One!  Two!  Two! 
[01:49:00]  Three!  Four!  Five!  Get lower!  Get lower, Danny!  Get down there, Danny!  Six!  Get up, down!  That's right.  Squat, Danny!  Seven!  Eight!  Move faster, Hawk!  Hawk is one behind.  Nine!  Hawk's doing real squats, though.  Ten!  Alright.  There you go.  God, do I miss Los Angeles.  Is that?  One!  One!  One!  Two!  Two!  One more for Hawk.  Any difference?  Hawk?  Activated it nicely. 
[01:49:30]  Hawk is really having a hard time.  Nathaniel?  I'm somewhere else right now.  Alright, fingers please.  It's time for another dollop.  Danny?  This is the worst thing I've ever done.  Danny?  Yes.  How are you feeling?  It sucks, dude.  It's pretty tough.  It's pretty tough.  It's pretty tough.  It's pretty tough.  Did you see Travis?  No.  Can we do a smaller dollop?  Yeah, smaller dollop, sorry.  That was fucking tough.  Alright, Eric?  It's spreading.  It's spreading.  This is going to knock Eric out right here, I think.  I don't know.  Eric's doing better than people expected him to do.  He's hyperventilating.  Don't breathe so heavy.  Alright.  I guess it's time to apply the next dollop of Icy Hot. 
[01:50:00]  Next dollop of Icy Hot.  Now, you'll be really inclined to cheat right now, I'm sure.  But do not, or you will be disqualified.  That's right.  We have monitors here watching you.  Eric is ready to cry.  Alright.  He's fine.  I'm ready.  Alright.  Ready?  He's not cheating.  I haven't done anything.  I got faith in you, Hawk. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  Let's go, Hawk.  Wipe that bag.  Wipe that bag.  Oh, my God.  Get in there.  There it is.  Alright.  Second coat.  Does it hurt to just touch it?  It's cold.  My scrotum's in my rib cage already.  Oh, wow.  Oh, Danny's having a hard time.  Come on, Danny.  That'll cool it off.  Eric is out.  Wow.  Alright, Danny.  Danny's in another place.  Eric's not out of the contest.  He just...  Alright.  His fingers are...  See, this is nice.  This is the calm before the storm. 
[01:51:00]  I think the icy is coming back in.  And then it gets hot again.  Yep.  In here it is.  Right now.  Uh-oh.  Is it heating up?  Okay, he didn't cheat.  His timing is perfect.  Yeah.  Alright, so now it's...  Hawk, say something.  It's burning.  It's tingling.  I think maybe some jumping jacks would be good.  Shut up, Dan.  Wow.  Dan is really...  Go get her.  Yeah.  He's hanging in there.  Danny's having a tough time. 
[01:51:30]  He's doing some deep breathing exercises right now.  He never intended to procreate anyway, so it's fine.  And Eric just wiped his eye.  That's real smart, Eric.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, I think...  Okay.  Uh...  Jumping jacks.  Ready?  Yeah, hold your pants up.  One-armed jumping jacks.  That's right.  Ready?  Let's get jumping.  Make sure you do it high and open those legs up and then close them again.  This is impossible, jumping jacks.  Ready?  And...  Exercise.  One, go.  One, two, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. 
[01:52:00]  Very good.  Alright.  Oh, Danny, that kind of hurt, Danny.  Danny, what happened?  What is that doing?  Is it unpleasant?  I have balls.  That just about sums it up.  Push my balls and me.  Push the side of my jeans.  What's that, Danny?  Uh-oh.  Push the side of my jeans.  Danny might be out.  Danny might be out.  Yeah, Danny can't let...  He won't let Eric beat him.  Bring in the cheese grater. 
[01:52:30]  That's right.  Alright, go get the bag of marshmallows.  They're having a hard time.  See, they don't want to let Eric beat him and Eric doesn't want to lose because he knows  he was expected to lose.  Oh, I know.  I know, this is a great...  Well, he didn't lose.  This is a great contest because Eric doesn't want these guys showing him up at all.  Nope.  Eric, how are you feeling?  Oh, well.  You're ready to tap out, aren't you?  I'll do some more.  Oh, Hawk's ready to do some more. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, wow.  I wonder how the water will do.  It will help it.  That'll activate it or help it?  It'll relax them.  Yeah?  Yeah, it'll relax them a little bit.  Put some water on it.  Danny?  Put a little water.  Eric's cheating.  I don't think that's really icy hot on his fingers.  Do you want to take a look, Danny?  Go ahead.  Do you want to take a look?  Oh!  Those are fighting words.  Nathaniel?  What?  I don't want to look.  Oh, your mic's off now.  My mic ain't working.  Fantastic.  Fantastic.  Fantastic.  Anything?  Anything to add? 
[01:53:30]  Um, I don't know.  Is it calming down now?  I just can't, yeah.  Yeah, it's calmed down.  It's only about E-Rock.  E-Rock?  E-Rock?  I'm not tapping out.  Oh, E-Rock's not tapping out.  He said no.  I don't think he's cheating.  E-Rock, why don't you get health insurance?  Come on.  Alright, more.  How's the Game Boy?  More icy hot.  How's Travis doing, by the way?  More icy hot.  More icy hot.  Here we go for round three.  Where's Travis?  In the bathroom, washing out.  Oh, good.  He's alright?  He's got his ball bag in the sink.  I just want to see who walks in to wash their hands. 
[01:54:00]  See these four creeps in their scrotums.  They've got nuts in the sink.  Because at that point, you'll just throw your ball bag in the sink.  You don't care who sees.  Alright, ready for round three?  Wait, Dan, you know what I'm talking to the mic?  Nah, it's the one in my face.  Alright.  Alright.  Well, it's called radio.  It's called radio.  Yeah, he's starting to lose it.  Talk loudly.  He's starting to lose it.  Yeah, we've got to entertain the people.  He's getting a little...  Alright, here we go for round three.  Here it is.  Another application.  Guys, let it rip.  Apply to those balls there. 
[01:54:30]  There they go.  Oh, I can't.  You can do it.  Christ.  Is it hurt to even just touch it?  Not when you put it back on.  No.  Oh, it's kind of numb.  Hey, Travis.  Travis is back.  Oh, Travis.  Alright.  That's the most pain I've ever been in.  Wait, get Travis on my...  Look at Travis sweating like crazy.  It's still not off.  I don't know how you get it off.  But you just...  You just got to sit still.  Did they get it?  I had some...  Danny had some left.  I had some sneak away between my fingers.  Yeah, straight down.  There it is. 
[01:55:00]  Travis is sweating like he just pitched an idea in a meeting.  Yeah, Travis was the first to tap out.  He's sitting there with his legs spread on the seat.  He can't take it.  These guys are up to their third round.  And they're fighting it.  Wow, Danny.  You alright, Danny?  Fine.  Alright.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Just when you think it's gone away.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hawk, how you doing?  It's a fucking burn.  Does it hurt?  Oh, yeah.  Wait, go back to Eric. 
[01:55:30]  He's having a really tough time.  It's all about Eric right now.  Listen in.  It's spread on my thighs, too.  Yeah.  Oh.  Listen to the breathing.  Dan?  Can I have a beer?  Alright.  Put your...  Now, here's a little exercise.  Put your legs together.  So your feet and knees are touching.  Ankles touch.  Go ahead.  Ankles touch.  No, make them touch.  Ankles touch. 
[01:56:00]  Okay.  Now, twist at the hips.  Oh, look at Eric.  Back and forth.  Twist at the hips.  Twist at the hips.  Further.  Further.  Twist at the hips, Hawk.  Oh, my God.  Hawk, twist at the hips.  Oh, my God.  Go down.  Go down.  Go down.  Go down.  Eric is staggering.  Twist at the hips.  Twist at the hips.  Twist at the hips.  Not at the knees.  Twist at the hips.  Twist at the hips.  Not at the knees.  Twist at the hips.  Not at the knees.  Twist at the hips. 
[01:56:30]  Eric is staggering.  He stinks.  Alright.  There you go.  Fuck.  Did it hurt, Finn?  Wow.  Did it hurt, Finn?  That really must have hurt.  What do you mean?  Oh, relative.  Eric?  Can I separate or do I still got to stand like this?  No.  Stand with them together.  They got to stay together now.  Good idea, Anthony.  Knees together, Danny.  Yeah, Danny.  Anthony.  Anthony's not Italian.  He's definitely German.  Put your knees together.  You're a sick fuck.  Oh, they're having a tough time.  Yes.  Alright.  Hawks.  Look how rosy red hawk's cheeks are. 
[01:57:00]  It's kind of nice, actually.  He's hyperventilating.  Wow, look at Danny.  Danny looks like he's going to kill somebody.  Danny, you alright?  Fine.  This is great because there's a whole thing going on here.  Like, these guys.  Oh, the competition between these guys.  Yeah, the competition between the rest of the gang and Eric.  Yeah.  It's always there.  Always there.  The next exercise is knees to the chest.  Oh.  Knees to the chest.  With legs completely together.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:57:30]  My arms are actually, I can feel them going numb like they're tingly.  Yeah.  That's how I...  How you doing, Eric?  My crotch is burning so bad.  You better tap out.  I don't know.  I think clock...  Yeah.  I would tap out.  You'd tap out, have everyone laugh at you, and then you can wipe off.  Don't tap out, Eric.  For the rest of the fucking...  of the day, they're going to know their balls had a little bit more temerity than your balls.  Well, someone suggested they run in place.  High-stepping.  Yeah.  High-stepping place.  High-stepping.  It's either that or another dollop.  What do you guys think?  High-stepping.  All right. 
[01:58:00]  Get over there, Eric.  Move over a little bit, guys.  Yeah, so you're in line with each other.  Watch your head on the TV.  You can button up so you can high-step without your pants falling down.  Yeah.  Button up, boys.  A little high-stepping and a little knees up.  Very nice and minty in here.  Yeah.  Isn't it?  It's wonderful.  It certainly is.  What?  Oh, yeah.  Travis, you still burning over there?  Travis, wipe the hands off.  These old men.  Come off the towel.  All right.  Here we go.  Danny's just a fucking crank. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah.  Danny will do anything not to lose this contest.  Oh, man.  All right.  What do you want him to do?  High-step for 15 seconds?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do we have to touch her?  Yeah, get your hands in front of you.  It should be high, yeah.  As high as you can.  High-high-step.  In four, three, two, one.  Run in place and high-step.  Go!  High-step.  There it is.  Oh, Jesus.  We've got two and three contestants left.  Oh, Eric.  God, I heard.  Get him up there.  Hawk is high-stepping.  Hawk is high-stepping.  Hawk is high-stepping. 
[01:59:00]  Danny's high-stepping.  Certainly is.  Everyone's high-stepping pretty good.  And stop.  There you go.  Eric.  How's that?  Oh, shit.  It rejuvenates the feeling.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think Nathaniel's not going to tap out.  No, Danny and Eric.  Dan is really being a trooper about this.  Dustin.  Eric?  We'll take more.  Oh.  Wow.  You asked for it.  We'll take more.  Oh, man.  Here comes the big dollop.  Here's a big dollop.  Here comes the showstopper.  Big Kev, apply.  What do you think we should stick some back to the crack, Bill? 
[01:59:30]  Oh, Kev.  That's a good big dollop.  That's a bit much.  That was too much.  That's...  It's got to be the big dollop.  Holy shit.  There it is.  Oh, my God.  Dude, we're almost done with the tube.  Get it in there.  Just to make sure.  The tube is...  He has way less than I do.  I'm sorry.  That's okay.  You're allowed.  Oh, Jesus.  I have those two.  Van, a little more.  There it is.  You're just going to keep getting more and more, people.  You know what's going to happen?  It's going to be fucking 11 o'clock and we're just going to be here with burning balls. 
[02:00:00]  I don't know about that.  You've got two hours.  Believe me, you ain't going to make it two hours.  Yeah, we're going armpits next.  And Travis actually has a suggestion.  He said, sit Indian style.  Now that he's out, he knows all the stuff that would have worked.  Yeah, look at Travis sitting there all relaxed.  Travis is going to get his fucking neck broken.  Look at the sweat coming from Travis.  Yeah.  I think now that they're a little sweaty though, you go armpits next.  I agree.  Armpits next.  That'll hurt.  All right.  Here we go.  Guys.  Hold on.  Reapply. 
[02:00:30]  Danny, why are you holding keys?  All right.  Sorry.  It fell out of my pocket, little Jimmy.  All right.  Here we go.  They're applying.  Don't get on Danny's.  He was holding keys.  He's going to kill you.  I didn't know why he was holding keys.  I just asked him.  I didn't yell.  Stab you in the neck with them is what he's going to do.  It's understandable.  He's angry.  All right.  Here we go.  Here we go.  We got the two PSPs, Anthony.  Three contestants left.  This is fucking ridiculous.  One guy.  Fucking A.  One guy bails and the other two guys will get the PSPs.  Here we go.  Start applying. 
[02:01:00]  Let it rip.  Get it.  Get a good one.  Get it right down there.  Make sure they're doing it.  Right under.  Spread it around that sack.  What a shock.  Fucking Steve the Sadist writes helmet question mark.  Oh.  Wow.  Fucking creep.  Is it getting onto your junk at all?  Yeah.  By accident.  I almost got the fucking cock head.  Oh.  Wow.  That would hurt.  Way to keep it fun, Steve.  Let's scar them for life.  Ah, shit.  Wait.  Wow.  No, no, no.  Ice application. 
[02:01:30]  Get it in there.  Come on.  Get it in there.  Get it in there.  Yeah, you're all done.  Nathaniel's done.  Eric's done.  Danny is now.  All right.  Danny got it.  Danny's done.  There it is.  They're enjoying that very quick moment of icy.  Ah, the icy.  Before it turns hot.  Mmm.  Oh, fuck.  And I believe it's turning hot.  Underpants budget.  Yeah, you need some new drawers there, huh?  Mine is beautiful.  Someone is suggesting that we make them teabag the jar. 
[02:02:00]  Another paper towel.  Danny of Staten Island.  Very good, Danny.  As they buckle up.  Do the fucking thing.  How do you think a rubber band against a ball bag would be?  Ow.  Now, guys, after you buckle up, pants or whatever you're doing, again, legs together.  Touching.  Hawk touching, yeah, at the knees.  Yeah, the legs together.  Ankles together.  Ankles and knees together.  The legs together seems to work.  Standard attention.  Wow.  Hawk is now bull-legged.  Come on there, Hawk.  Come on, ankles together. 
[02:02:30]  There you go.  All right.  Ankles together.  Nathaniel's doing good.  Yeah.  Unless he's playing possum.  You never know.  And all you guys, and touch your toes.  Go ahead.  Up.  Without bending your knees.  I'm not that far.  There you go.  And touch your toes.  One more time.  Give those toes a little touch.  And touch your toes.  One more time.  Oh, Hawk almost fell over.  Hawk fell backwards.  Danny is crying.  Danny is losing it. 
[02:03:00]  Hawk.  I feel like someone has to sneak onto the junk.  Yes.  Uh-oh.  Absolutely.  That kind of got it onto their junk, I think.  Hawk?  Mine's sliding into the back.  Oh, great.  Up your ass.  Are you cracking?  Hawk, stand up straight.  You're bending over.  Stand up straight.  I think one more toe touch, Ant.  I mean, that's just my opinion.  And one more toe touch, Ant.  Down to the toes.  Keep those knees locked.  There you go.  And back up.  Stand up straight. 
[02:03:30]  Eric?  That burns.  Stand up straight.  Oh, Eric might be out.  No, he's not.  He's staggering.  They all expect him to be out.  He's staggering.  All right.  You know what exercise I used to love as a kid because it was so much fun?  Which one, Ant?  When you get on your back, hold your hips up and do the bicycle in the air.  Bicycle.  Bicycle, guys.  Bicycle in the air.  It's fun.  It's bicycle time.  Now, get on your backs.  Ant, you're a statistic.  Come on.  Fuck.  Yeah. 
[02:04:00]  Which way are we going?  It's nice.  I saw their legs together.  Get on the backs.  This will make some drip into the ass crack.  That's right.  Now, hold your hips up and get your legs in the air.  Oh, it's dripping.  And now pedal like a bicycle.  Wait.  Danny might be out.  Come on, Danny.  You're not on your bicycle.  Look at Hawk.  Hawk's pedaling away, Danny.  Hawk's pedaling.  Hawk is pedaling.  I don't see Danny pedaling much.  Jesus.  Danny might be out. 
[02:04:30]  I'm going.  Danny's going.  Danny's pedaling.  What?  I'm going.  Going or gone?  No, I'm going.  As in my legs.  Oh, he's going.  Alright.  Well, they're doing a good job.  Alright, that's enough of that exercise.  Alright, back up.  Back up.  Let's see what that did.  Let's see what that did.  Hold on.  Fucking Master Paul is a suggestion.  Po?  What's your suggestion?  Yes, Master Po.  You feel okay?  Wait, Eric.  Hold on.  Hold on a minute.  Eric, you alright?  Eric?  Yeah, I'm alright.  Cool. 
[02:05:00]  I think the exercise is what's killing Eric.  Yeah.  That's right.  All that mayo.  That's right.  Okay, guys.  He's just smearing mayo on his balls.  Fucking meat arteries.  Alright, Master Po's in to help out.  Help the situation.  Alright, guys.  Slowly, I'd like for you to lift up your knee.  In the air.  Alright?  And then I want you to bring your knee to the left.  Oh.  That's a good idea, Po.  Bring it to the right.  Po, don't you have a homeless guy going to need some help?  Alright, one knee up.  One knee up.  You can balance yourself.  You have to...  As high as your belly button.  So it's like a 90 degree angle.  There you go. 
[02:05:30]  And now over to the side there.  There you go.  Just ample.  And then to the right.  You're not turning your...  He's...  He's pivoting on his ankle.  That's the worst.  What am I doing wrong?  You're pivoting on your ankle.  You're supposed to move your leg over.  You're moving your leg.  Look.  You're not death of a swan, you homo.  Fucking...  Bring your foot right where it is and then you bring it to the left and then to the right.  Oh.  To the left and then to the right.  You don't pivot though.  The one leg stays straight.  Alright, that's right.  A lot of people are suggesting the armpit now that they have...  Now that they have exercised. 
[02:06:00]  You guys get the choice of one armpit.  That's right.  You have to keep on going, guys.  No, they're done with that.  Alright, we're going armpit.  Eric, take off that sweater.  You've got a t-shirt underneath, right?  Yes.  I don't want to ruin your shirt.  Oh, please.  A big dollop to the armpit.  Now that they've exercised, this could be brutal.  A lot of people suggesting this.  It's going to burn, really?  A lot of people suggesting this.  Armpits?  Yes.  That'll burn.  Sure it will.  Yeah, now they've got to concentrate on two areas.  It could really mess them up.  I don't care.  Well, Danny, look. 
[02:06:30]  You're not going to kill one of us, Danny, after this, are you?  Uh...  Let's see.  Alright.  This could be the showstopper.  Look at Eric.  Eric is going from rosy red to pale.  You've got to give Eric a lot of credit.  No one thought he would hang in this long.  Can I just request some help with rolling up a sleeve, please?  Sure.  Alright.  I'm going under.  Alright.  Are you going under?  Sure.  Alright, ready?  And, uh, yeah. 
[02:07:00]  Apply.  Apply.  Look at Danny.  Oh, look at that.  He's rubbing it in.  Rub it in.  Rub it in.  There they go.  Yeah, Sam ain't gonna cheat.  Holy crap.  Danny looks like LL Cool J from the, uh, MTV Video Musical.  They always show that clip.  The fuckin' white.  Put the arm down.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Put that on.  There you go.  Alright, so right now it's nice and cool.  Now, yeah.  And, what are we thinking?  Is it burning yet? 
[02:07:30]  Starting to warm up.  Starting to warm up, Eric.  Look at these ideas coming in.  Go with the upper lip.  Put some behind their knees.  Have them blow each other.  That's to celebrate the victory.  Eric?  Starting to burn.  Starting to burn, Eric.  Okay.  And?  Danny?  I mean.  Nice.  Taking your mind off the nuts.  It's not your balls.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's true.  Alright, we'll go back to the balls.  That's true.  No, I mean, not that I was complaining.  Alright, well, if you want to go back to the balls.  It's not complaining. 
[02:08:00]  Behind the knees.  Why?  Would that hurt?  Odd as hell.  Other pit.  We already all...  Do the other pit.  What?  I was just gonna say, we already all think you're gay, so if you tap out now, it's not  like we'll think differently.  Aww.  Oh, shit.  We're going home without a PSP, so it doesn't matter.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Wow.  Alright, we gotta figure out how to decide this, huh?  Yeah.  I say no one gets it.  Yeah, why don't we just do a fifth-caller thing and give it to a listener? 
[02:08:30]  I'll give it to a listener.  Alright, back to the balls?  It's kinda taking their mind off of the nuts.  Well, this will be the end of the first tube of Icy Hot, by the way, just about.  Yeah.  How can they fit so much Icy Hot down their pants like that?  I don't know.  You know, honestly, after that last dollop, I don't even think applying more to the balls  is even gonna do anything.  Cool, reverse psychology, put more on it.  Alright, we'll do that, we'll see how that works out, and then splash a little ball 
[02:09:00]  We'll splash a little water on there.  And if that doesn't work, we'll splash a little Old Spice.  Yeah.  We could have them just rub their eyes.  Oh, God, no.  You insane.  That's right.  They're blind and can't play the game.  Run across 57th Street.  Bittersweet.  Huh?  My butt just fell off my pants.  Oh, did it?  We'll pick it up.  He's got to bend down and pick up part of his pants. 
[02:09:30]  All right, here we go.  Let's apply again the Icy Hot to the balls.  Ooh, that's reactivated.  Not dead.  All right.  We might have to go with pine cones up the ass.  Take some football camp advice.  We doing it?  John?  Yeah, let her rep.  All right.  Oh, my goodness.  What?  What's the deal, Danny?  My balls feel like oatmeal.  Oatmeal?  Nathaniel?  It's just a mushy mess.  Nathaniel?  Eh.  It's more of the same uncomfortable awfulness. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah.  And Travis was in there for maybe 30 seconds.  You really tapped out.  Maybe a bit.  You know, some got in his vagina, so he had to tap really.  Wow, Danny scores.  All right, what other exercises?  What was the one exercise that really got him?  Knees together?  Yeah, anything with the knees together.  And then bending down?  Bending down at the knees.  Ah, fuck.  Oh, it's bad.  What, Danny?  I thought you said there was no feeling down there.  Oh, wow.  I just, I think I'm just. 
[02:10:30]  Wait, you know what?  Uh-oh.  You might have got the shaft.  Danny, what's going on?  I just got like one of those waves.  You know, like one of those, that heat wave that you get?  Yeah, like a hot flash.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And the hawk is feeling a little uncomfortable.  Wait, how about this?  You've got to stand straight up with your legs together, and you've got to take one foot  and cross it over the other foot.  Oh, yeah.  Cross your feet.  Yeah.  Legs together.  Legs together.  Yeah, cross your feet so you're standing.  No, Eric, look at me.  Yeah, the hawk's right so far.  And there you go. 
[02:11:00]  There you go.  And just stay like that.  There you go.  Just stay like that.  Yeah.  Go, Danny.  Put it all the way over.  That's a good idea, Jim.  Eric, let's go back to Eric.  He's having a problem.  Don't give up, Eric.  You all right?  Kind of stings.  Good luck rubbing this stuff off.  And with legs crossed, touch the toes.  Here we go.  Yay, touch the toes.  Touch the toes.  Get as close as you can.  As close as you can get. 
[02:11:30]  Back up.  Eric?  I have an idea.  How about doing splits?  That might relieve the pain.  Oh, no.  I don't think I can practically do a split.  What?  I can't do a split.  Yeah, he can't do a split.  How about they just...  We're dealing with your cheerleaders.  How about they just...  Watch the whole area.  How about they just lay on their bellies?  I might spread things out a little bit.  Yes.  Hmm.  Yes, good idea.  Do the caterpillar.  Yeah, you lay on your belly and you're bump. 
[02:12:00]  Eric?  No problem, right?  I'll do it.  Danny?  I'm just going to have to.  Yep.  Oh, my God.  I don't know.  I think if you're going to do that, you might as well just have them from the outside of  their pants just grab their sack and jiggle.  Yeah, we could do that.  You know?  If the floor is supposed to do something, I think...  All right.  If they just, you know...  How about punches to the ball bag? 
[02:12:30]  Eric?  You know, you ever see Full Metal Jacket where they're marching around?  Ah, this is my rifle.  This is my gun.  You know, you got to kind of just grab like that and jiggle.  It's $300, man, for this thing.  Wow.  They don't want to do it.  Let's do it.  Let's do it.  All right, go ahead.  Just grab a hole of your sack from outside your pants and, yeah, and just kind of scratch 
[02:13:00]  a little.  Give it a good squeeze.  Dig in like you got the crabs or something.  Dig in there.  They're wiping it off on their underwear.  That's all right.  Trust me, it makes it work.  Shut up, Kevin.  Ooh.  I love you.  Ooh.  Shut up, Kevin.  There we go.  Oh, they're itching real good now.  All right.  All right.  Jesus H. Christ.  I think he's been hard on me. 
[02:13:30]  It's burning.  I got an idea.  Yeah, I mean, I say they take a cup of water now and pour it down the front of their pants.  It'll activate everything.  Yeah.  You think so?  Oh, yeah.  We got to get one more.  Let me see your war face.  Sir, you got a war face?  Ah!  That's a war face.  Now let me see your war face.  Ah!  I don't know.  All right.  All right.  Do your war face.  I can't do war face.  No, it's a scream. 
[02:14:00]  Ah!  That just fucked our audience up.  Yeah, well.  Should we do the cup of water?  Or just take a hand of water, because it's cold.  Yeah.  Take your hand of the water.  Rub it in there.  And rub your whole ball bag in the area.  Rub your bag with some nice water.  That ought to help.  I think if you just open up the underwear and pour it in, though, it's going to start dripping  everywhere.  You think?  You got to go home.  Yeah.  You got to go home.  Just get a cup of a palm full of water and rub it on there.  Get under the balls.  Get a good one.  In the grurn. 
[02:14:30]  Oh, wait.  Danny?  How you feeling?  All right?  I'm really glad I took a dump before this contest.  Ew.  Your days of finger-banging, old Mary Jane's rotten crotch, screw her pretty pink panties,  are over!  All right, guys.  All right.  Palm full of water.  Sorry.  Well, we kind of all have to do it pretty quick, right?  I'll agree.  At the same time. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah.  How exactly are we doing this just so I get the strip?  You take water, you get your hand all wet.  All wet.  And you cup your balls and just rub under the ball bag.  All right.  There you go.  You don't need to put your cup down, then.  What have we got here, fucking comedian?  All right.  Here we go.  Now they're going with water.  They're in a lot of pain.  Well.  No shit.  No shit.  Well, thanks, Dan.  As much of our hands we can get, right?  Yeah.  Let your whole hand get wet.  All right.  You can bend your hand, too.  There you go.  Perfect.  Shit.  But Dan has got that giant hand. 
[02:15:30]  He really does.  Not a giant.  Not a giant.  All right.  All right.  Ready, set, go.  Under the balls.  Under the balls.  There they go.  Now push back towards the crack.  Yeah.  Piece of.  All right.  A little water.  My body kind of needed this anyway.  Yeah.  Might be refreshing.  We don't know.  That's right.  Cool.  I think it's refreshing, right?  Eric?  It's not hurting yet.  All right.  Well, good.  There you go.  We gave you a little help there. 
[02:16:00]  Danny might tend to disagree.  Danny?  It fucking hurts, bro.  Danny's having a problem.  It hurts.  Eric?  This nut sack is probably very chafed.  It's starting.  Eric?  Now cross your legs again.  Yeah, cross your legs again.  Cross them legs.  Cross your legs, Danny.  Ooh.  Uh-oh.  I am hard, but I'm fair.  This is going to end with a fight.  You watch.  There is no racial bigotry here.  I do not look down on niggers, kites, wops, or greasers. 
[02:16:30]  Danny's puffing and puffing, having a hard time there.  Well, Eric?  Eric, grabbing for a paper towel.  It's burning.  It's burning?  Guys, is it burning worse?  We all know what's next, unfortunately.  Yeah.  We all know that a little finger in the dollop between the old asshole is next.  It's either that or the wiffle bat.  How about both, Hope? 
[02:17:00]  Oh, Jesus.  They can't.  They're not, they don't even, look at them.  They can't do that.  Eric?  I'll do more.  Danny?  Uh-oh.  Danny threw his arms up in disgust.  Danny's like, come on, just tap out.  You want a hundred thousand.  Danny?  You know, I mean, I'm down for it.  It's probably getting close.  Yeah.  It's probably getting close. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, it's getting close, huh?  Um, I'm fine.  That's fine.  He is.  My leg is cramping up.  The front of the pants are getting wet.  All right.  Any other suggestions there, Anthony?  Danny's getting close, so.  Yeah, I know.  I think the water really did it.  I say wet your hand, icy hot, combination, right? 
[02:18:00]  Like a watered-down version of the icy hot, wet hand, and icy hot.  We're on the second tube of icy hot, by the way.  All right.  I've never seen more instant feedback in my life.  Just wet your hand a little bit, put a little icy hot in there, and, uh.  Yeah, dunk the hands.  Yeah, it doesn't have to be soaked, but.  Dunk the hands nice.  A little icy hot.  I think I had a big dollop.  Oh, my God, nice size.  Yeah, as big as the last one, I guess.  Yeah, a nice-sized dollop.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A little raculate. 
[02:18:30]  All right.  All right.  Oh, Christ, let's give it to my leg.  All right, Eric?  Eric is not going to tap out.  There's a lot to prove here.  Yep.  All right, here we go.  Apply.  Jesus.  Apply.  I guess, too.  Talk to you guys.  There you go.  There you go.  And they're applying.  Once again.  With a wet hand right there.  From the icy hot.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to flip back there. 
[02:19:00]  I need more surface area.  You probably don't want to say that to a national audience,  I said you need more surface area.  Well, stuff tends to retreat when you're putting icy hot all over it.  Keith had a good idea.  What about a little on the nipple?  On the nipple?  Why the nipple?  It's a sensitive area.  Try it.  Let's see how this works out first.  Yeah, let's see.  What's going on?  It's a little icy right now, right?  A little icy?  It's hot.  It's hot?  Yeah, it's getting hot.  The armpit's still burning.  Armpit's still burning? 
[02:19:30]  Okay.  Hmm.  I'm not thinking of any more sick, cruel things.  Dude.  China.  I'm telling you, the fucking, the ass cheeks are the fucking, that's the deal.  The, uh...  Might have to be the tiebreaker.  Of course it is.  The feedback is ridiculous.  Chris from Long Island.  E-Rock hasn't wanted anything this much since the last time Hellman's released its new line of mayo.  Shittooth from Long Island just tuned in.  Are you guys doing a live version of Rent Boys? 
[02:20:00]  Shit.  Someone suggesting they should do the, uh...  The Silence of the Lambs talk.  Oh!  Yeah.  Oh!  I already did that at the Halloween party.  Bill from Waterford.  How much of a pussy is Travis now?  Yeah.  A lot of people suggest that they get some on their taint.  It's already there.  It just drips in.  It's well in there. 
[02:20:30]  This is gayer than a, uh, Andy Dick hot tub party.  Oh, that's my brother from South Pole.  Very good, Scott.  So, Dan, what are you going to play tonight?  Your brand new PSP or your brand new Xbox 360?  It's 360, which is being delivered today.  Hopefully both, Danny.  Oh.  What else can we do?  Let's try.  The cheeks.  I did.  The cheeks.  Gotta go between the cheeks.  I'm just going to make sure that is accomplished.  If you, if you, you take it and you put it down between, you can see them rub it.  Believe me. 
[02:21:00]  I, I rubbed toothpaste in my asshole when I was young once because I thought it would cool  me off.  I gotta tell you, as gay as this sounds, I've never seen more instant feedback in my life.  Yeah.  Uh, people.  No one is going anywhere.  Going nuts over here.  Going nuts.  There's some bragging rights here.  Yeah.  What else can we do?  The floated kick.  Cheeks.  Well, you might have to do, but now I understand, uh, you probably don't want to, uh, take a  finger and jam it up your ass or anything like that. 
[02:21:30]  I would, I would put it on a paper towel and then have them wipe with it as if they were  wiping their ass.  No, because it might pull something up like that.  Danny just took a dump.  I don't want to see that fucking dirty towel.  Yeah.  Bill, you don't have to show us when you're done.  Helmet.  Helmet.  Told you.  Helmet.  Helmet.  I'm not going to put it over the cock hole.  That way.  Way to take a stand, man.  Really?  That would, uh, that would be.  We're not going to do anything degrading. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah, that would be so much pain.  Yeah, that's taking it too far, obviously.  That's your rally cry.  Really?  I would, uh, no.  All right, what else can we do?  Cheeks.  It's got to be between the cheeks.  It's got to be a little bit, not...  The exercising was the thing that was really helping.  We haven't exercised in a while.  And Anthony's coming up with the good exercise.  I'm trying to think of any more of that.  What was the one exercise that was really good for this?  You know, I don't remember.  The running in place.  Jumping jacks they hated.  They hated the jumping jacks.  Okay.  All right, guys. 
[02:22:30]  I had a couple more jumping jacks there.  Everybody's got both hands free now?  Yeah.  All right, here we go.  Let's make them count.  All right, make them count.  Let's make them count, guys.  All right, here we go.  More jumping jacks.  Ready?  And go.  Go.  One, two, three, four.  I love the Marine.  Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, 
[02:23:00]  eighteen, nineteen, three, four, five.  All right, that's good.  That's good.  That's good.  Anything?  Yeah.  It's starting again.  Eric?  Wait, Eric is staggering.  Eric?  Hey.  Huh?  Some ended up around the crown.  You can tell that Nathaniel's a martial arts guy, man.  Danny?  The crown.  All right, more jumping jacks.  This is what's going to do it right here. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  More jumping jacks.  Here we go.  Danny's out of shape from smoking, though.  You can't make him do too many jumping jacks.  He'll pass out.  That's all part of the game.  That's not good point.  More jumping jacks.  That's what's getting him.  You can't let him recoup here.  Ready?  Let's go.  Another set of fifteen.  Here we go.  Ah.  The jumping jacks.  It's not that the jumping jacks hurt.  It's this whole process now that hurts.  Yeah, I understand.  But more jumping jacks is going to make it hurt more.  Ready, Nathaniel?  Yes, sir.  All right, here we go.  Dan? 
[02:24:00]  And...  Ready?  One, two, three.  Go.  Exercise.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.  That's good.  That's good.  That's good.  All right.  That makes their junk kind of move around in areas that it shouldn't be.  Legs together.  Legs together.  Yes, legs together. 
[02:24:30]  Shut up, Kevin.  Shut up.  Oh, wow.  Oh, shit.  He is pissed.  And touch the toes a couple of times.  There you go.  Oh, there you go.  There you go.  All right.  Eric?  Oh, oh, Eric.  Oh, oh.  Eric?  It's burning really bad.  Yeah, you better tap out.  Don't do it.  Just tap out.  You got that $100,000, man.  100K.  You got 100K.  Who cares if they ridicule you and call you a faggot?  So what?  What do you think, Eric? 
[02:25:00]  I'm still in.  Damn it.  We have a radio show to do.  Yeah.  Jeez.  100,000 if you stopped buying medium T-shirts.  Eric?  What?  You're in?  No, he's fine.  Yeah, I'm still in.  Holy crap.  How are you going to decide?  I don't know now.  Now I'm at a loss.  Why don't we just play Rock, Paper, Scissors?  Yeah, exactly.  Cheeks.  Exactly.  Cheeks.  It's got to be cheeks, man.  Yeah, it would have to be.  I hate the fact that it has to come down to this.  I hate the fact that it's come down to this, but yes, Dan? 
[02:25:30]  I think there's a huge sort of gay element to that.  No, no, no, no, no.  No, just the fact, are we talking cheeks or anus?  I think we're talking like...  Wait, what's the matter?  Danny's saying no.  No.  Danny's saying no.  It's going to drip, because it kind of like, it just kind of like melts into you.  So I know it's going to drip and actually get in there.  And that's not going to be fun.  In his ass. 
[02:26:00]  Exactly.  I believe it says for external use only.  Okay.  All right.  That is external.  Someone is suggesting we run out and get some Tiger Bomb.  Ten times hotter than Icy Hot.  Same shit.  I don't know.  These three are troopers, and I don't think...  Someone is saying that we should set up a fan to blow air at him.  Well, then they'd have to stand there, circle jerk.  Well, Eric?  Bring it on.  I'm ready.  Yeah, he's not giving.  This is amazing. 
[02:26:30]  This is really amazing.  Paul suggested those cross-legged jumping jacks.  You know how you cross your legs when you do jumping jacks?  No?  Oof.  I couldn't even do those.  Like, without Icy Hot.  Like this.  Like this.  Yeah.  Oh, look.  Like river dance.  Yeah, exactly.  Do some river dancing.  Something's dripping.  I really think it's between...  Something.  It's definitely between Danny and Eric as far as...  I don't know if it's the cream or my actual balls melt this.  As far as tapping out.  His nuts have melted.  That's what it feels like. 
[02:27:00]  Eric, is it unpleasant?  A little bit.  I'm ready.  Give me something else.  Yeah.  I don't know.  You might be in some trouble here.  More Icy Hot.  One more big dollop.  I think Eric is going to be comfy up here.  One more big dollop of Icy Hot.  Here we go.  Yeah, and then we've got to figure something out.  And we're going to work the exercise angle.  How can we grapple?  Huh?  Those squats worked pretty well, too, right?  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:27:30]  And I think the bicycle worked pretty good.  Yeah.  Let's apply and...  Yeah, the bicycle.  Yeah.  Squats and bicycle after this.  And apply.  Kev, you've got to make sure they're doing it.  Yeah, Kev.  Get down in there.  Danny's not doing it.  I'm trying to get my fucking button.  Good call, Kev.  Yeah.  Good call, Danny.  Danny.  Kevin, get that buckle for him.  All right.  I'm just looking for anything else that might work. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  Get any raid?  Up here, go ahead.  Get the razor blades.  Nah.  Jesus, it's fucking everywhere.  No, it's just...  It's not absorbing anymore, Kev.  All right.  It's just getting put...  There's so much of this on your balls  that when you try to apply more,  it just moves it around on your head.  I can't imagine if these guys are dealing with this.  Completely clean hand.  Which is fucking impossible.  Dude, I tried rubbing that all on my balls,  and I still have a ton of it.  You just rubbed it on your underwear. 
[02:28:30]  Ooh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Controversy.  Either he's cheating,  or he's got the biggest set of balls  on the face of the earth.  Like a basketball.  He's cheating.  He's cheating.  He's cheating.  Nope.  How come Danny and I  have had totally different-looking hands than you?  Uh-oh.  They're accusing him of cheating.  Want to take a look?  Yeah.  As a matter of fact,  Danny definitely would.  I say a little man-to-man inspecting.  Because I think he's bluffing.  I think there's going to be a big fucking clump.  Right in his underpants. 
[02:29:00]  Uh-huh.  Well, then take a look.  We could do a post-mortem.  Go get the Tabasco.  Dude.  Tabasco.  I don't know what we do here.  All right, now we do the squats.  We're squatting,  and then bicycle kicks.  With the legs together.  Yes.  May I have something to drink?  No.  No.  All right, let's do some squats.  Yeah.  It's got icy hot, man.  It's handed on the water cup  that he's been dipping his hand in.  His ball hand.  Go ahead.  And start squatting.  Wow, Eric is sweating. 
[02:29:30]  All the way down.  One.  There we go.  Two.  Legs together or apart?  Three.  Together.  Together.  That's what I heard.  Yeah.  Everybody legs together.  Three.  Come on, three.  Four.  Four.  Ooh, I was having a tough time.  Five.  Five.  Six.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, God. 
[02:30:00]  That might cause spontaneous combustion.  Let's go.  Four more.  Their balls could burst into flames.  Seven.  Seven.  Oh, shit.  I'm tough.  Eight.  Nine.  There you go.  Last one.  Make it deep.  Ten.  There it is.  How you doing there, Eric?  Eric?  Not good.  Not good?  I've lost all faith.  Yeah? 
[02:30:30]  Wait.  All faith in what?  In the integrity of Eric's play.  Yeah, me too.  You think he's bullshitting?  Yeah.  Fuck.  Anything to win, right, Phil?  Ooh.  Anything to win.  I like this smack-talking.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, this will end in a fight.  Yeah.  Good.  Kill two birds with one stone.  We have in front of us the mega death sauce.  What is that now?  The hottest sauce.  That's Blair's death sauce. 
[02:31:00]  Apparently, it's in the Guinness Book World Records as the hottest hot sauce on the planet.  This stuff is like if you get in your face.  Danny again is like saying no.  What?  Dude, I have such a bad tolerance for hot sauce.  My brain would probably explode if I had any of that stuff.  How often have you put it on your balls?  Yeah, exactly.  You'd be eating it.  Yeah, you know.  Well, then...  Yeah, it wouldn't be eating it.  It would be putting it on your ball.  Gay men's health crisis.  There goes Steve. 
[02:31:30]  Should we go with the hot sauce?  How would you do that?  Will that be any hotter than the icy hot?  I have no idea.  This is uncharted territory for me.  We didn't think we'd get to this point.  No.  The exercise was working, man.  Not Eric.  Eric?  No, the exercise was working just because it was exercise.  Let's do more squats.  Let's do more squats if it's hurting.  You got it.  We need a winner here.  Here we go.  Ten more squats.  And go.  Go.  One, two, three, four, five... 
[02:32:00]  Go down.  There you go.  Six, seven...  Almost.  Eight, nine, and ten.  Ten.  How are you holding up?  Eric can't stand up straight. 
[02:32:30]  Eric?  My head hurts.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah, I think it's just the exercise.  Could be.  It's...  Well?  You're fine.  I'm still in it.  Oh.  I thought he was going that time.  I thought they had him.  He's wiping sweat off himself.  He's got flops and fries, dude.  Danny's really pissed off. 
[02:33:00]  You don't think he's doing this?  Well, I mean, regardless of whether or not he's doing it...  I don't think he's deserving of a PS, a brand new shiny PSP.  That's not the point, Danny.  What's your point, then, Eric?  Eric, if...  Stay in this.  Eric, if you win the PSP, I want you to just smash it in front of the other guys.  And then buy one with your riches.  That's right.  Okay.  Dude, you are worth $100,000.  That's right.  This is just to basically humiliate these two.  He doesn't care about this.  Yeah, I know. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah, that's what he's doing.  That's nothing to him.  That's nothing to him.  No, he laughs at that thing.  PSP.  Buys a bunch of them.  Give him to the kids in the neighborhood.  Yeah, there you go.  That's what he does.  He's hurting.  What's hurting?  What's hurting?  It's a combination between the armpit and the sack.  Someone is suggesting we get Steve to give him all wedgies.  Oh, jeez.  Great.  He's pretty much ruined anyway, so...  I don't know.  I'm at a loss now.  Would you guys go with the quick wedgie? 
[02:34:00]  Wedgie?  Wedgie.  All right.  All right, get Steve.  Oh, Steve's going to love this.  He don't care.  I don't want to touch him.  It's my fantasy come true.  Add heat to it from a hairdryer.  Do we have a hairdryer on hand?  This will kill him.  Yeah.  You have a hairdryer?  I have a hairdryer, but a dryer.  All right, let's get...  We're going to get a dryer.  It's not one of those things that are used to melt insulators on wire, is it?  It is?  Isn't that a little hot? 
[02:34:30]  No, it's like a hairdryer.  No, it's like one.  It looks like one, but it's about a thousand degrees more.  No, I'll do see.  All right, we'll bring in the hairdryer.  Steve.  Yeah.  Would you give these guys a wedgie?  What do I want to do with you?  It's all about the lawsuits that I want to do with.  Happily.  With your teeth.  All right, you've got to give these guys all a little wedgie.  All right.  All right.  The classic wedgie.  We're not talking atomic wedgie.  We're talking a classic back of the underwear lift up wedgie.  Yeah.  Okay. 
[02:35:00]  Full force.  You don't like...  You don't hurt them, but just...  No, I don't want...  Yeah, no hurt.  You don't hurt me in pain.  That's the thing.  Just a snug...  You know, not that you're trying to rip it out.  Not that you're falling and you're trying to pull your ripcord kind of thing, and it's  not working.  All right.  Just a firm...  Okay.  ...bit of discipline.  Here's how you do it.  Steve, pull their underwear until you start to get a hard on.  Oh.  Oh.  That's my application, Jim.  If you're just tuning in, by the way, we should reset this, Anthony.  We've got three guys that are trying to win a PSP.  We've got our boys behind the scenes. 
[02:35:30]  We only have two PSPs.  We started with four guys.  We're down to Eric, Nathaniel, and Danny.  Travis bailed within the first, like, 45 seconds or so.  We're almost, like, 45 minutes into this contest, I think.  I think one of our homeless are missing.  Yeah, the homeless guy just wandered off.  All right.  Go ahead, Steve.  Give him all wedgies.  All right.  Here's the first one.  This is Eric's wedgie.  Two.  One.  Ah!  Ah!  Quickly!  Quickly!  Oh, he went down.  You've got to do it quickly. 
[02:36:00]  You know what?  So it's fair.  You know what?  Come on.  I just wanted Eric to get his wedgie.  Oh!  Danny jumped out!  Danny jumped out!  He just wanted Eric to get a wedgie.  Eric!  Get a mic on Eric!  Eric!  Eric!  How's that feel?  Well, that fucking hurts.  Oh, no.  I've got to say, though, in fairness, I hate to throw Thane under the bus.  He should have to get one, too.  You can't fucking have to put a set of rules.  Dan should have to get a wedgie.  Yeah, sure.  Thane will take it, but you've got to, just in fairness for Eric. 
[02:36:30]  Well, keep a mic on Eric.  Eric's losing his mind over there.  Eric?  Steve, you've got to give Thane one up.  Eric, are you crying?  Eric, there are tears coming out of his eyes.  Burning like...  Fuck.  You need to get a wedgie here.  Excuse me.  All right.  And...  Wait, keep a mic on Eric.  Eric has tears in his eyes.  Yeah.  So do I.  Three, two, one.  There goes my underpants.  This is the gayest shit we've ever done.  We've got grown men giving other grown men wedgies. 
[02:37:00]  What's wrong with us?  Can I pull it up there or can I pull it down?  Huh?  I've got to keep it up there?  No, you guys are in there.  I think that they're in there.  Yeah, you've proven your metal.  Now there you go.  Pull it out of your ass.  Oh, shit.  That's true.  We do have a...  Let's make money bags by a memory card.  I can have the one gig.  All right.  Finally.  Yes, then.  You could have the one gig.  All right.  Wow.  Wow.  That was great.  Did you get video of the wedgie?  You got...  All right.  Good.  Travis got video of Eric's wedgie.  That's going to be classic. 
[02:37:30]  God damn.  Huh?  Was my underwear breaking audible?  Yes.  Okay, good.  Your underwear actually busted.  He broke your underwear.  Yeah.  Wow.  Are you wearing...  You're wearing boxers, then?  Yeah, boxers.  And you are wearing...  The boxer briefs.  Boxer briefs.  Yeah, that's a little rougher.  Oh, my God.  That looks so painful.  That wedgie was hysterical.  Danny.  Classic bully wedgie.  Congratulations, Danny, for hanging in there that long.  Yeah.  Really good job.  Now, go in and wash your balls.  Yeah, I went into the bathroom, and I was just... 
[02:38:00]  You just...  You're looking at the stalls.  You're looking at the sink.  What are you going to do?  You don't even know where to start.  You know what?  I would wet some paper towels, go into a stall, and scrub a...  Just scrub a towel, right?  Yeah.  Wet a stack, and then wet another stack, put some soap on that one, and then wipe.  I wouldn't wash, and...  What?  I think that's going to activate again.  What the hell are you going to do?  I don't know.  I would dry wipe it.  Dry wipe it, yeah.  That's what I would do.  Ask Travis, the one that lasted a whole 40 seconds.  Travis, what did you do?  Don't lie to us.  What did you do?  Take a Q-tip and just wipe it off?  Fucking hump. 
[02:38:30]  No, I dry wiped, but that kind of spread it, so I just kind of sat there in pain and sweat  and dry wiped some more, but I wouldn't put water on it.  No?  No.  What about soap and water?  I didn't try soap.  Yeah, like put soap and water on a paper towel and scrub vigorously.  All right, go get the razor.  We're going to celebrate by shaving Eric's balls.  You know what might get it off?  Just chew up a little bit of dentine and slap that, or cinnamon gum, and slap that on your 
[02:39:00]  sack.  Oh, wow.  You've got to see the video of Eric getting a wedgie.  That is going to be...  There were tears coming out of your eyes, man.  You all right, Eric?  That looked very painful.  Why don't you go wipe off, you fucking cook?  Was it so much the wedgie or the fact that it made it burn and moved it?  The wedgie kind of divided it in half, and then whatever residue was left on the underwear  went all the way down and up.  So it's like a big line going all the way up to the back. 
[02:39:30]  Like you shit yourself off.  Well, fucking, you're tougher than Danny.  That's got to bug Danny.  Danny just didn't want to take the wedgie.  I understand.  He did want to see you get the wedgie, but who wants a wedgie?  No, you've got to keep it fair.  Danny was hurting, too, man.  No one wants the wedgie.  He was hurting bad.  He was hurting really, really bad.  In all fairness, your PSP.  So Eric Erock gets the PSP and the new infected game, and Nathaniel gets the same.  Doesn't it suck that me and Opie got one of those, and we just had to be us? 
[02:40:00]  You mean you didn't go do this at home just to...  Well, you know, have a little fun.  Yeah, my heart was really going out to you yesterday when you were having all those technical  issues with your free PSP yesterday.  Yeah, it's like I'm trying to get online, and I got icy hot up my ass, and make sure  the batteries are charged before you try to play it on a train, okay?  I'll, uh, yeah, well, I will play a little, we'll go in there and, uh, yeah, have a little  network.  All right, we're going to be gone for a while. 
[02:40:30]  We got a lot of catching up to do, I believe.  I think they did that for almost an hour.  I certainly am not going to go into the bathroom and take a leak this week.  How long?  I've got 45 minutes of tape.  45 minutes of video?  And you pussied out, uh, quick, so that must have been 48 minutes of, uh...  Yeah, I was going to say 45 minutes and 40 seconds, exactly.  Derek, get us out of here for a while.  We'll, uh, continue with the Opie and Anthony show.  We got a comic outside the studio.  Who is that?  Raymond.  He's an Amish dude.  He's an Amish comedian.  Is he really Amish?  For real Amish.  And he's really a comedian. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah, I know him for a long time.  I thought he was joking.  No.  Is he allowed to deal with electricity, though?  Oh, yeah.  How can he, uh, how can he, uh, be, uh, in the big city?  I think he explains it.  I gotta ask him.  Oh, he'll explain the whole thing?  I guess.  And also, uh, we have InXS coming in today.  Ooh.  Uh, all right, Derek, why don't you get us out of here for a little while?  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the ONA virus.  All right, we're going to lose Bill Burr soon, so let's get back into this.  We got one more here from Peter from Inflames. 
[02:41:30]  Hey, what's up?  It's Bill Burr.  Hoping after this show.  You know that because you're listening to this shit.  Uh, I'm with the bass player from Inflames, Peter Iwers.  Hey, how was your set today, man?  Uh, it's going to be fine.  We haven't played yet.  Oh, you haven't played yet?  All right, we need to start that again, so I don't look like I'm going to...  You hear that and go, yeah.  No, fuck it.  Just keep going, man.  I'm like a retarded, uh, I got no reference there.  So how do you think your set's going to go tonight?  You looking forward to it?  Are you on the main stage?  Yeah.  Are you over there?  I think it's going to go great. 
[02:42:00]  I mean, it's, uh, we always put in 150% and, you know, it's a bit different playing from  a sitting-down crowd, but still it's going to be great.  So far, all the shows have been amazing, so I'm pretty sure today will be as well.  Do you guys like your vibe?  You become more mellow, melodic?  Is that, like, how you guys are?  I think we're metal.  Oh.  It's, you know, it's hard to categorize us into one base, basically, you know.  Okay.  All right.  So, you know, like, Iron Maiden meets, you know, like, like, movies and stuff, you like  Iron Maiden meets, uh...  I guess we could say that, but it would be unfair, probably, to just categorize it into 
[02:42:30]  one, you know.  I don't like that.  We're metal bad.  All right.  That's cool, man.  That's cool.  How long have you guys been playing?  Uh, a long time.  I was just, uh...  I think it's, like, 12 years, something.  Like, 12 years?  Out of everybody in the band, if you had to kill someone, who would you kill?  Myself.  You'd kill yourself at the road sign to get to you?  No, no.  But, I mean, it wouldn't be fair to the others, otherwise.  It's just one.  Oh, God.  That's just...  No one would go with it. 
[02:43:00]  No one wants to commit.  It wouldn't be fair to the others.  It wouldn't be fair to the others, otherwise.  Cheers, man.  I like this guy.  This guy, I can tell you're like the peacekeeper in the band, right?  You're like the mellow one.  Listen, man.  We're also doing, uh...  This is kind of a side thing.  We're kind of doing this, uh...  This benefit.  Somebody beat up a special needs kid in, like, Newark.  And, uh...  So, we just want you to just say, you know...  Just give a shout-out to the kids so they know not to beat up somebody with, like, you  know, special needs, you know?  To just, you know...  Just say, like, uh, you know... 
[02:43:30]  Hey, guys, you know, it's not cool to beat up somebody.  Just because they're different or whatever, you know?  Just, you know, just like a quick kind of, like, uh...  Like a sound bite.  And it's kind of weird, but throw a couple of, you know, fucks in there.  Just because our fans are kind of retarded, you know what I mean?  So you need to, like...  Like rock and roll, you know?  So just wing it.  Hey, guys, this is Peter from Inflames.  You should not treat everybody equally and, uh...  Don't beat anybody up or do something bad to them just because they're different.  Everybody's the same way.  Okay, that's totally the perfect vibe.  Just throw in special needs and throw in, like, one or two fucks. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah, the upwards.  Yeah, just kind of...  Like I said, they're retarded.  Same thing again, or what?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey, this is Peter from Inflames.  Treat everybody the same way.  You know, people who have special needs and everything like that.  Don't fucking go and do any bullshit and start treating people up because they're different.  Treat everybody the same, dude.  That's beautiful.  And the kid's name is Russell.  Just give him a shout-out.  Same thing, a couple of fucks.  He's a big metal fan, so it'd mean a lot to him.  That's the kid who got beat up, Russell, from Newark.  Hey, Russell, what the fuck are you doing? 
[02:44:30]  Sorry, chef, please.  And just take care of yourself, man.  See you soon.  All right, dude, that's beautiful, man.  Thanks so much, and good luck tonight.  That's beautiful.  Holy shit.  You are insane.  I love how in the same breath.  I wish you could have seen the looks on their face as they're trying to wrap their fucking head around the concept.  I don't doubt it.  I love how in the same breath you're saying this poor special needs kid.  Yeah, listen, there's a fucking retarded.  They use this archaic term like retarded. 
[02:45:00]  Oh, wow, Bill.  That's great.  Yeah, that was great.  Just add special needs and throw a fuck in there.  A couple of fucks.  Oh, and they just do it.  Say hi to Russell.  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  I need PSP games.  GTA. 
[02:45:30]  We're back.  It's the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  We've got to get the Amish comic in here.  Wow.  I didn't realize what these guys did for the show.  Phones are ringing like crazy.  No one's answering them.  I don't have instant feedback to my left.  There's no one around.  They're all just scrubbing their ball bags in the bathroom.  Oh, Eric.  The first one back in the studio.  He's limping in.  How you feeling, buddy?  Oh, it hurts like hell.  How'd you take care of it?  Well, whoever suggested soap should be shot. 
[02:46:00]  Soap made it worse.  That would be me.  I'm sorry.  I was just speculating.  It's trial and error.  It's like alchemy.  Hell, we don't know.  I thought we were experts because we had these microphones in front of us.  Try this elixir.  It's about as red as Ope's shirt there.  Oh, your ball bag?  Thighs, everything.  You got a rash?  You got a little dirty rash?  All wrapped in paper towel right now.  Danny, how are you feeling?  Better.  It's still a little difficult to walk. 
[02:46:30]  You're going to be walking a little bow-legged.  Yeah.  I can manage like this a little better than before.  No, it's weird.  I was in the bathroom.  Jimmy and I went for leaks and it was like a big party going on in the bathroom.  All you smell is the minty freshness of the icy hot and then you smell shit.  And then I found out.  I'm like, holy crap, that's disgusting.  Someone's dumping in the stall, right?  And then I asked Keith.  I go, Keith, what happened to your homeless guy?  He goes, oh, he didn't wander off because we thought he just wandered back onto the streets. 
[02:47:00]  Oh, no.  He said that he had to go to the bathroom and what did you say?  Tell me.  Go ahead, sorry.  He had the Hershey squirts.  Look at the Hershey squirts.  That's what we were smelling in the bathroom.  That smelled like rotted flesh.  It was awful.  It was awful.  Oh.  Someone is suggesting do not get Opie Luminous or whatever it's called.  Luminous, L-U-M-I-N-E-S.  It's puzzle crack and he'll play it like solitaire. 
[02:47:30]  Oh, this guy remembers my solitaire addiction.  Oh, yeah.  Which is a dumb addiction, I know.  All right, let's get the Amish guy in.  Let's get the homeless guy in.  We'll start with Amish guy.  Amish comic.  Yeah, he's dressing the part, that's for sure.  He's totally Amish.  Jimmy, you know this guy?  We haven't worked together in many years.  We used to do gigs together in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.  Of course.  And he's still doing gigs in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.  There he comes.  He is Amish.  How are you doing, sir?  How are you?  How are you, sir?  I'm a complete terror man. 
[02:48:00]  I've seen three guys limp down the hole and I didn't even want to come in here, man.  If we're going to ice my nuts, I'm out of here.  No, we will not ice your nuts.  That was just for a PlayStation Plus PSP.  Wow.  Very popular in the Amish community.  I don't really like video games and I don't think I'm ever going to get into them now.  No.  Man.  Well, see, now I'm confused.  Yeah, we are very confused.  I'm very confused.  That's good.  That means you're thinking because if you see me in the city and you don't smash into something,  then there's something wrong with me.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:48:30]  I'm walking around New York this morning causing accidents.  What the fuck was that?  Yeah.  See, I don't understand.  I thought, perhaps it's a misconception about the Amish people.  I thought technology was a no-no.  It's a horrible no-no.  But see, I'm out.  I'm an ex-Amish.  I'm the black sheep.  Oh.  I'm running around Lancaster putting wow stickers on boogies and the cows are showing me their  teats.  It's not working out the way I wanted.  But at least we're starting with. 
[02:49:00]  But now it works for you to keep the look of the Amish because on stage you come out and  do your act and it's probably a little, you know, different.  It's a lot different and they stare at me like a deer in the headlights.  There's that moment of denial like I'm death and I've come for them.  They're just kind of.  Yeah.  That is some beard you got there.  And that's part of my real head.  You know, I get that all the time.  Is that weird?  No, that obviously is real.  Where the hell would you buy something like that?  You might want to grow a mustache just to kind of. 
[02:49:30]  No, that's the whole Amish.  And I'm more aerodynamic in the boogie without that.  You know, I can bank them turns.  The beard though.  Could you be Amish if you are not very hairy and can't grow a beard?  I can't be Amish just for coming here now.  Well, I understand that.  I don't mean you.  I mean, like, could somebody who can't really grow a beard.  There are people out there.  You never see Asian Amish.  Because I don't think it's because they can't grow the beard.  I think that's it.  I think that's it.  But basically the beard is when you get married. 
[02:50:00]  Oh.  That's what it is.  And then you grow the beard.  You grow the beard.  So when you're single.  You can't go whoring around because you can't really hide that wedding band.  Are you married?  Ha, ha, ha.  No, that hair club for men guy fucked up.  I don't know.  You try to part it in the middle and comb it over your head.  It just doesn't work.  One of my fondest Raymond memories, we were doing, like, this Wildwood gig together years ago.  Great.  I'm going to need therapy after this story.  No, it wasn't that bad, but it was really funny.  Like, him and his, uh, you still married?  Yes.  I remember he and his wife went to the beach.  And I'm like, uh, he came back. 
[02:50:30]  He was like, oh, it was great.  I just got a blowjob on the beach.  And it was just great to hear a fucking office guy talking about a hover in the sand.  And it is when you're enjoying yourself.  A seagull from hell swoops down and sucks a $45 weenie out of the roll and it's gone.  What happened with you and, uh, being Amish?  I, I, I, how old were you?  I, uh, the process started about at 12 years old, man.  And, and, and city, you see, when you guys fuck your lives up, you're like on your own.  But when an Amish kid goes to a party, I have cheerleaders, man. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah.  They're cheering for you to just totally screw up your life.  Here, have another beer.  Smoke some dope.  Come on.  Why is that?  I, it's, it's fun to bring someone over.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Over to the dark side.  It's weird, man.  But, uh, I, you started doing that, I guess.  I, uh, I got sucked into technology.  To this day, I have a technological obsession, man.  If it plugs in, I gotta have it.  Laptops, cell phones, whatever it is, man.  Cable TV, man.  I just, you're getting action? 
[02:51:30]  Yeah.  Any of your family defect?  Or was it just you?  No, no, my, my parents are dead, man, so it makes it rather easy to do what I do.  Any siblings or anything that are still Amish?  Uh, no, everybody's out.  Uh, yeah, everybody's out.  Wow.  Out of the closet.  That is something.  And even, you know how, this is a weird city, and in this city, I still get stared at.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, look at you.  You get stared at, people travel there to look at Amish people.  People travel to, look, it's like a fucking tourist attraction. 
[02:52:00]  Well, a lot of people are too busy to get on the tour bus, so I have to go around and  see them one at a time, right?  Amish teenagers wear very tight slacks.  I noticed that when I used to work at Lancaster.  Yeah, it was kind of creepy.  It was, like, really fucking, like, homoerotic, a bunch of very tight slacks.  Ben and I'd bitch in a bonnet, look at us over at the barn raisin.  Do her buggy style.  Do they fuck in, like, when they're young there, or no?  Oh, yeah.  Scrapple sucking sluts, man.  You take them around behind a barnyard and do them buggy style, and who's your daddy?  Really? 
[02:52:30]  And we know, because we all got the same DNA.  It's just a whole other problem.  Amish whores.  Holy crap.  We got no nudie stripper bars, man.  You get a lap dance in Lancaster, an old man comes out named Lap and does a little jig for  you to pay him a dollar to get rid of him.  Leave me alone, you bastard.  Amish comedy.  I got to tell you, I'm a little distracted, because the homeless guy that Keith the cop  brought in is shaking hands with NXS and conversing with them, and NXS has no idea that guy is  homeless and probably carrying at least four or five diseases. 
[02:53:00]  He told them it was chief from the cuckoo's nest, so I think they're getting his autograph.  He absolutely looks like him.  We have to get a feather headdress and have him stand on the side of the expressway and  just cry.  Yeah.  Just weep.  You know, he was jonesing for liquor.  He was jonesing for liquor, and he said, I'm shaking, and the liquor stores are open,  and he left and came back, so I guess he's okay now.  You know what we should do?  Make him stand outside in front for liquor money and just go, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo,  in a circle. 
[02:53:30]  I'm out there smelling that guy, in here watching these guys get their nuts scrubbed with lava  and Listerine, and I'm thinking, okay.  Where do I fit in?  You're feeling just fine.  Should we get the chief in here?  Yeah, I would love to talk to the chief.  We've got to talk to the chief as well.  All right, here's how the seating arrangement's going to go.  Kev, you are going to have to go over there.  You, Amish friend, you can sit here.  Wow.  Anthony doesn't give anyone that seat.  That must be a... 
[02:54:00]  I like the Amish.  All right.  I like the Amish.  Well, that's good.  See, I brought you guys whoopie pies.  What?  You brought us what?  Yeah, you can do that.  Whoopie pies, man.  What's whoopie pie?  It's basically like a giant, tasty cake.  Whoopie pies.  Why am I changed there?  Don't worry.  Oh, shit.  It's going to hide my money.  And now...  What did you just say, Jimmy?  Who left my change there?  Whoopie pies for you, man?  He's a good egg.  What the hell is this?  What is that? 
[02:54:30]  I'm not eating a whoopie pie.  It's like these big, chocolatey, cookie, cakey-looking things with cream in the middle.  They're probably good.  Can I have one?  Where do you get these?  It actually looks like they are so goddamn tasty.  But this...  Forget it.  I didn't bake them, man.  Shady Maple from the Smorgasbord and Lancaster.  No, I'm sure they're fantastic.  But, you know...  You might want to give them to those guys.  They feel their nuts off a little bit.  I think Chief might want one of those. 
[02:55:00]  Chief might want one of those.  Chief, what's your name?  Dave.  They just call me Wolf, though.  Oh, Wolf?  They call you Wolf?  Yeah.  Or Wolf?  What's up?  What are you guys doing?  We're hanging.  Do you want a whoopie pie?  You want one of those?  A whoopie pie?  Nah, because I don't think I can hold that down in my stomach.  No?  Yeah, you just had the liquid shits in the bathroom, huh?  Yeah.  The homeless guy there.  The whoopie pie will hook you up, I think.  He was making whoopie pies in the toilet.  Oh, God.  Look at that one of the kids' wrap machines. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, Jesus.  It's Seldo's on the corner.  Huh?  You can't hear nothing?  You got headphones on.  That should work.  So, Keith brought you in.  We're doing the homeless shopping spree in, I don't know, two or three weeks from now.  And we like to interview the potential homeless people.  Right.  Well, if I ain't in jail by then, I'll go on that street.  What happens?  You get into trouble?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, out on the street?  What?  Fights and shit?  You know me.  Look at my knuckles are swollen.  You like to battle it out on the street? 
[02:56:00]  Yeah.  Well, you know Indians.  Yeah.  Indians and vodka.  They mix.  I know.  Yeah.  The fire water fucks you guys up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Shit.  Gave away a whole fucking country for a few beats because of that shit.  No.  I'm going to hustle up 24 bucks and buy Manhattan back.  You think you'll get them to sell?  I'll get it.  I'll try, you know.  What type of Indian?  What tribe of you?  I'm a Sioux Indian from South Dakota. 
[02:56:30]  South Dakota Sioux?  Yeah.  Wow.  That's the real shit.  Yeah.  That's none of those fucking Long Island Indians.  We were the ones that killed Custer.  Yeah.  You fucked his day up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And they still hate us.  You got any ancestry you can trace back?  Any warriors and shit?  Yeah, I got family.  I went back to South Dakota about two months ago.  How did you get there?  I took the bus because I got so drunk.  My brother put me on a bus.  Yeah.  And I just slept for the whole way.  I got off in, what was that? 
[02:57:00]  Chicago.  I had a layover there.  That's a little car.  A bus layover.  Yeah.  A bus layover.  Wow.  It was like five hours.  Who booked your bus?  Don Wicklund?  A little inside joke.  I went back and I seen my sister.  Instead of a nice greyhound, it was an old school bus.  It takes like three days to get there.  Yeah.  That's a long trip.  Yeah.  What do you do on a bus when you're on it that long there?  A little faster than a travelway, though.  You just fall asleep. 
[02:57:30]  You fall asleep.  You fall asleep and then you fall asleep and hope you don't get butt raped.  You fall asleep and then you fall asleep and then you fall asleep and I fell asleep in Chicago for a while.  Yeah.  Then I got back to Rapid City and I called my sister and she came and picked me up.  Then I was like this.  I said, Audrey, I need to sober up for a little bit.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden her husband walks in with two cases of Budweiser and I was like, oh no. 
[02:58:00]  Oh boy, back.  Here it goes again.  Here you go again.  You a drinker?  Oh yeah, Indians drink for sure.  Indians drink, but homeless guys drink too.  So why are you homeless?  So I went over and I seen my, I was drinking there for about ten days and I said, oh man.  And my cousin came down from Minneapolis.  Yeah.  So I went up to see my daughters, you know.  Uh huh.  And I went up there and drank there for a while. 
[02:58:30]  How many daughters?  Two daughters.  They're in college up there.  Squaw?  No, two squaws.  Yeah, two squaws.  I love using derogatory Indian terms.  Jesus Christ, this guy's going to hit me.  It's going to scalp you.  All of a sudden I started getting slapped up.  Yeah?  And we were like this.  You're getting drunk again.  I was like, yep.  Mm-hmm.  Because I stopped drinking for about 12 years until the towers fell.  Then I was down there volunteering and I started drinking again and my ex-wife was like, 
[02:59:00]  hey, you got to check into a detox.  And I was like this.  Nope.  Yeah.  Got a backpack, put in a couple of pairs of pants.  And took for the streets.  Got out.  I, I, it's, it's, it's cheaper to get married than to get divorced.  Hell yeah.  Where did that come from?  We got married at town hall for like 25 bucks.  Philosophy here from all the cultures.  Yeah.  We, Amish, we can't get divorced.  Yeah.  And a divorce was like $1,500. 
[02:59:30]  Shave the damn beard.  I'm out of here, bitch.  $1,500 to get divorced.  $1,500?  Yeah.  Wow, that's expensive.  Holy shit.  And it only cost $35 just to get married.  See, $1,500 to get divorced?  You overpaid by.  Wow, did I overpay by almost a million.  Jesus Christ.  This is a long island.  You know what?  I'm going to send a $1,500 check next time.  And see what the lawyer sends back.  I shook the, I shook the lawyer's hand. 
[03:00:00]  He had a limby little fish hand.  And I was like this.  Yeah.  At least give me a squeeze, motherfucker.  Should have treated him like Custer.  Yeah.  Oh, motherfucker.  Now, what, uh, what.  This is good, actually.  What do you do to sustain yourself out on the street?  How do you get your money?  How do you earn the couple of bucks you need to make the.  I usually hit the women up, you know, because Indians are very rare in these countries.  Well, that's true.  Especially here.  So I usually hit the women first.  We did a pretty good job with that one.  Yeah.  The women usually. 
[03:00:30]  So the women like to have.  Well, would you, do you think you'd do better in maybe a little more traditional Indian dress  out on the street, maybe for money?  Sometimes I do, but, but I got this one necklace, but the girl took it away from me.  Oh, what, turquoise?  Yeah.  Stuff, real Indian looking stuff.  Yeah.  See, I'm thinking if you got out there and was like, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Oh, sometimes I do the ring.  Oh, people fucking, you know, you make a lot of money. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah, I do sometimes.  Do you do the rain dance?  Did you do the rain dance today?  Sometimes I do the rain dance.  You son of a bitch.  I'm looking out there.  That's what I did.  That's what's raining out there.  It's been nice, and then you made it rain.  Because I got my Walkman now.  So when I start hearing anything, you know, you hear the weather report, and then you laugh  at him.  I heard Leonard Skinner this morning, and I started dancing.  Yeah, what's Skinner's song?  Sweet Home, Alabama.  I thought it was, ooh, ooh, that smell.  Yeah, that's a good one.  I started dancing.  Can't you smell that smell?  It's probably raining now. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah.  Hey, I...  And ooh, that smell came on right after that, too.  Oh, it did.  And I was dancing for a while.  And you didn't take the hint.  Three of them.  For once, it wasn't me.  Right.  I would like to see him do a rain dance or something.  Yeah, Walt.  Can you do a little chant for us or something?  Do you know any Indian chants?  Any rain dance type of Indian...  If I do that...  We don't get many Redmen in this studio.  Hey, how are you? 
[03:02:00]  He's Amish.  I know.  It's my friend.  I've been talking to him.  Yeah, he loved me on the sidewalk.  That's where you got the Walkman.  I'm kicking his skin out of that Amish guy.  He won't fight back.  He didn't build a barn around him with no doors.  I told him.  I said, I like to have that beard.  Only I get the Fu Manchu mustache like that.  See, Indian can't be Amish.  I'm not that familiar with scalping, so there was a moment of panic.  He might have taken your chin.  Are you kidding me?  Yeah.  There's not much to scalp there.  Let's get a chant going.  Can you do a chant? 
[03:02:30]  Nope.  I ain't going to do no chant.  Why not?  Because then it'll start raining even more.  Do you know a sun chant?  How about a sun chant?  Do you know something to make the sun come out?  Yeah.  And what do you do for a...  How do you get your money with the hustling?  You just kind of go up to the women and do what?  I'm like this.  I'm like this.  You got spare change on you.  Yeah.  And if they say no, then I say, how about a cigarette?  If they say no with the cigarette, I say, how about a piece of gum?  And if they say no, I say, how about a ride to South Dakota? 
[03:03:00]  And put my thumb up in the air like this.  Ah, that's the gimmick.  Then they quit.  Give me a dollar.  That's four hits.  And if they don't hit on the fourth one, they usually hit on this one.  How fast do you talk?  You hit them over the head and take their money.  I never stop and chat with anybody.  You got me and I'm gone.  Hey, can I please?  No.  Usually.  What step is the cobblestone over the head?  And then you give them a compliment.  When they're walking by, you're like this.  Whoa, beauty deserves to be blessed.  And you bless the beauty that walks by. 
[03:03:30]  And you step back and let them go by.  Yeah, at that point they're running.  And then sometimes they come back the next day and they take you home and you take a shower.  Oh, yeah?  You're taking a shower and all of a sudden they come into the shower.  On Earth 2.  Whoa.  All right, listen.  Listen, we got Tim.  Tim from Newburgh on the line.  Tim, go ahead, Tim.  Hey, sitting bull, do you cry when you see litter?  Has anyone ever...  Yeah, when you drop it, though.  Oh. 
[03:04:00]  No one's ever thrown garbage at your feet on the side of the highway, right?  That's an old one.  All right, let's go to Todd the trucker.  Todd.  Good morning, boys.  Welcome back to the program there, little Jimmy.  Thanks, fella.  Hey, I would like to play Make Bill Puke.  Do you think we can get the homeless guy to lay down a liberator and Bill can come in and  sniff his ass?  Ooh.  We've done a lot of things.  Okay, look at the time.  I've got to get out of here.  The Amish comic wants out now.  He's having a whoopie pie going home.  Yeah, he's taking enough Icy Hot.  He's having out.  Who was the comic that told that joke when he was a kid? 
[03:04:30]  His teacher told him to sit Indian style, so he laid in the gutter.  That's like Ira Hayes.  Voss.  Is that Voss' joke?  So I got a bottle of whiskey and laid on the curb?  And laid on the curb.  I took a header the other day, man.  You did?  Yeah.  I fell off your horse.  No, I tripped on one.  It was a little, when the high little, some of the paveways are a little higher than the  other one.  Uh-huh.  And I tripped, and I was on vodka big time.  Oh, shit.  Oh, man. 
[03:05:00]  Vodka's your poison.  I ran across the street, almost ran into this girl, slid for a little while, and I was  like, oh, man.  Yeah.  I said, I almost hurt this white girl.  Yeah.  You know how many Indians are in this country making fortunes on the casinos?  Oh, I got money.  Can't you get involved in that?  No, I got money.  I'm a carpenter.  I'm in 608 Union.  You're in a union?  Yeah.  I'm a 608 Union worker. 
[03:05:30]  So what are you doing?  Why are you homeless?  Why?  Because I choose to be.  You choose to be?  Why?  Because the list is so long.  It's like 3,400 people.  It's going to take like three months for me to get called back.  Like, I could go, you know, shape jobs, but why do that when I could make a lot of money  out there hustling on the street?  Wouldn't you like to have a roof over your head, though, and a place to go, and, you know. 
[03:06:00]  I had that for a long time.  Might as well just hang out with my friends down on the corner.  He's basically saying he'd rather be homeless than married.  If that doesn't say a lot about the Institute of Marriage.  This girl comes up to me.  These girls always come up, and they're like this.  You've got to stop drinking, and we can do something.  And I'm sitting there going like this.  Nope.  Because when you wake up in the morning, and you've got the shakes, it's easy to say stop 
[03:06:30]  drinking, but it's hard to do.  But you're an Indian.  Just throw a tambourine in your hand.  You'll be fine.  Yeah, right?  That's why you've got a peace pipe, man.  Fire up a little peace pipe.  My other man.  My other girlfriend.  Mister.  Mister, how often do you go to jail?  Yeah, how often do you go to jail?  Mister.  Like every other week.  Mister.  Every other week, and it's always...  This guy throws me in jail.  Have you been to the tombs?  Yeah.  Yeah, I've been all over.  Why were you in jail?  You ever throw him in jail? 
[03:07:00]  They try to throw me in jail all the time.  Nah, I haven't thrown him in jail, but he's gotten a boot to the ass a couple times.  Yeah.  I ran from him one time.  What are you insane?  I thought I was fast.  But this dude's quicker than me.  He's a fast motherfucker.  He grabbed me behind the back, and I was like, ah, put my hand on behind my back, and  he's like...  Why were you running from him?  Why am I running from you, Keith?  Why was he running?  I love all the homeless guys.  I love his first name.  He's a little heavy-handed with some of the other boys sometimes, and we don't like them 
[03:07:30]  to beat on Tippy Tom.  Nah, nah.  Are you beating up the other homeless guys?  Nah, you saw me kick Steve in the mouth, remember?  Because Steve kicked me in the head.  Yeah, you can't count back.  And I turned around, and I was like this.  I seen him standing, and I was like this.  Holy shit.  It's like you're a fucking camp counselor, Keith.  Yeah.  And it's like rowdy kids, and you've got to keep them in line.  Yeah, you're...  Nah, but if I lay down, and somebody kicks me while I'm laying down, I jump up and kick 
[03:08:00]  them back.  Yeah, but you're on a sidewalk.  Nah, this was down in the subway.  Oh, oh, you sleep down in the subway?  Yeah.  Are you a mole person?  Is it warm down there?  Are you a mole person?  Yeah, do you live underground?  Sometimes, but now they know my face, so I can't go down there no more.  Yeah, put on some war paint.  Why, they don't like you down underground?  That'd be good.  For the people around America, man, there's mole people in this city.  There's thousands of people that live on the streets of New York.  When I jump to turnstile, usually they know me, all the ladies. 
[03:08:30]  Why don't you get a MetroCard?  Well, because I don't want to spend it, I'll spend it on beer first.  I hear you, my friend.  Do you do drugs, too, or is it just alcohol?  Nah, it's alcohol.  Yeah, you can kind of tell me I'm just an alcohol guy.  Oh, well, if we...  Hey, by the way, Eric is coming up with a very good observation from Georgia.  Eric?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, how did you get David Lee Roth in the studio?  My voice sounds like him.  All right.  It does sound a little like him. 
[03:09:00]  Panama!  It wouldn't surprise me if they gave him a few markets in the city company.  Did you get picked up in Central Park again with the weed?  Nope!  All right, sing some David Lee Roth for us.  Do it, do it, bobbity-bop!  Yeah, come on, give us a little David Lee Roth.  No, David Lee Roth!  Why?  Because my voice is going out again.  Sounds good, actually.  Yeah, it sounds wonderful.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  All right, let's go to Pennsylvania and say hi to Jim.  Hey, Jim?  Yeah.  What's up?  I was wondering, a question for Raymond there. 
[03:09:30]  Has he ever eaten chai, foots, and boona?  Not really, but...  I swear she was breathing when I left her.  Yeah, that's...  See, that's Raymond, the Amish comic.  Wait, what did you ask me, V8?  Whenever I hear Pennsylvania Dutchman, I always think there's Amish bounty hunters sent out to haul my ass back in.  I get it.  A little twitch in the back of my neck.  What did he say?  Five foot, and boona.  No, I didn't.  As a matter of fact...  Well, now the Amish guy's answering. 
[03:10:00]  A question for the Amish comic.  But when I went back to South Dakota...  Yeah, South Dakota.  We ate some dog.  They cooked up some dog, and I was like this.  Whoa, that's got it, gamey.  All right, listen.  Well Hung from New Orleans is saying,  Is his Indian name dances with delirium tremors?  Ah, you're chewing gum.  That's a very good idea.  That's great.  Hey, we got the Jägermeister music tour featuring Disturb with special guest Corrosion of Conformity, Anthony.  Win custom tour prizes from Schechter, Coffin Case, and Peavey.

Well, I hope you're not.  I'm not in jail.  What is that a picture of?  This photographer took a picture of all the homeless people on the corner.  Oh, I see good old Tippi Tom there. 
[03:13:00]  Yep.  He has a nice little pose.  Everybody's there.  Well, we want to get everybody on a bus and take us out to the Short Hills Mall.  Are you friends with Tippi Tom?  And take us shopping.  Huh?  Are you friends with Tippi Tom?  Yeah.  Tippi Tom gave me this jacket.  He did.  That's very nice.  This is Tippi's jacket, but we traded because he said he's getting...  People are starting to get him...  Very nice picture, though, sir.  What?  What'd you do that for? 
[03:13:30]  Opie.  Give it back, Opie.  All right.  Here you go.  You're going to, what, tape it back together?  Yeah.  Of course I am.  You should know some spells to make that thing just suck back together.  Opie, why'd you rip it up?  Oh, I'm a magician.  Here's your picture back.  Oh.  Can I see that?  Ah, yeah.  Mister, can I look at it?  I was fucking not watching you.  All right.  So, anything else you want to say there?  Yes.  Hold on.  Don't rip it up, lad.  I'm not going to rip it up.  Anything else you want to say? 
[03:14:00]  We're going to take you out there to Short Hills Mall and take you on a shopping spree.  Is this right, like, on fucking, like, 8th Avenue down by the Meatpacking District?  No, it's on 13th and Granite.  Are you familiar with the Meatpacking District?  I actually went through with you on a drive-thru one time.  Well, what do you think?  That's a good picture of us.  But no, this, I actually saw Tippy Tom one night there.  He ran over, and I gave him money on the fucking corners.  I was making it right on 8th Avenue.  Tippy Tom.  All right.  That is a good one.  Well, we're going to...  That's why I'm saving it. 
[03:14:30]  We'll be in touch.  We've got to decide if we want him for the homeless shopping spree.  I think he's pretty good.  Keith, have we covered it?  Booze him up.  Anything else can he add?  Yeah, what else you got?  Anything?  Well, we're good.  You don't want to do any chanting or any of that?  No chanting, because if I start dancing, it's going to rain even harder.  Well, let's dance a little bit.  Let's go to break with a little dance and a little woo-woo.  Only when I hear Legend Skinner.  Top ten classic.  The old woo-woo.  So you'll do a dance to a little Legend Skinner that we had some? 
[03:15:00]  Ooh, that smell!  Let's do the top ten woo-woo songs.  No, the other woo-woo.  Oh, tree, get out of my way.  Hey, how are you now, bonec?  I gotta go to Apollo.  Yeah?  Let's make a drum circle.  Let's do something.  Drum circle.  No.  We've got to get some drums in here.  It was great to meet you.  Well, thank you.  How much change you guys got?  Nice to...  I'm not giving you any.  Yeah, no dance, don't change.  What do you mean you ain't giving no change?  You chant, you chant. 
[03:15:30]  Nobody's got.  Chant for change.  Nobody's got a penny or nothing.  I'll give you a whoopee pie.  How much?  I got no pockets.  Is this a whoopee pie?  We need some change.  That's a whoopee pie.  Give him a whoopee pie.  Yeah, have a whoopee pie.  Chant for change.  Yeah, look at all that money.  Look at all that money Jimmy has.  That'll buy a lot of alcohol.  Look at that.  Are we buying a chant?  I have.  Because then you can chant, it'll rain, and you don't have to hustle.  $5.75.  I'm going to kick them in for the chant, because this is too weird.  Only for chanting.  Yeah.  Opie has to say what I can give it to you. 
[03:16:00]  That's right.  That's up to Opie.  He's the boss.  Well, I'm not giving him a chant.  How about a chant or something?  I'll kick in three.  I'll kick in three for the chant.  That's $8.75.  Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, no, no, I'm Mike.  I'm giving those other guys 50 bucks to put their nuts in a blender, bro.  Is that an ending?  Yeah.  So, what kind of chant was that?  Well, it's like the version of the American Anthem. 
[03:16:30]  Oh.  In Sioux.  Let me hear that again.  Yeah, let's hear that.  That's great.  It just means the flag.  It's like the American Anthem.  Do they sing that before, like, a big scalping match?  Scalping match?  It seems like what they do is they sing it before, like, the powwow when people come out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When they first come out to dance, they sing it just like, you know, the opening song. 
[03:17:00]  All right.  Like, sing it like you mean it, man.  Yeah.  Come on.  That's cool.  Are you kidding me?  We have a lot of Indian listeners all over America right now.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, they'll probably call back and say, hey, that motherfucker's drunk.  And your point is?  All right.  All right.  Very good.  Well, thank you very much.  We will...  Here's your $8.75, sir.  Hey, that's pretty good.  That's very nice.  Not a bad take. 
[03:17:30]  That is pretty nice.  That's sweet, right?  Good job.  Huh?  Are you going to kick me on the...  Whoa!  I didn't see that blonde up there.  Ah, he found the pictures on the wall.  Yeah.  You saw the blonde, you have to give the money back.  Yeah, you see all the naked pictures on the wall?  Great.  Some poor woman's getting raped tonight.  Oh, man.  It'll be some fucking random blonde.  Yeah.  $8 left that's seen as a crime.  Wait, you hear him?  He goes, why are you doing this to me, man?  What's wrong, man? 
[03:18:00]  You haven't seen a naked woman looking like that in a while, huh?  Not on the wall.  I usually see them on the bed.  I think you're overstating your sexual prowess.  No, he lays his pictures out on the bed.  It's a better toss that way.  Keep no wind up.  All right, hold on.  That's funny.  We got a guy from South Dakota, Sean.  Sean, what do you got?  Hey, how's it going?  What do you got?  I'll just call him Bravo Sierra on this guy.  All right.  He don't sound like he's a native at all. 
[03:18:30]  Why?  I sound like David Lee Roth.  Well, anybody can sound like David Lee Roth.  Hey, speak Indian to each other.  Well, I'm from Pine Ridge.  I'm from Rosebud.  My dad was born in Parmlee. 
[03:19:00]  Hey, speak Indian to each other.  Yeah.  Yeah, talk to me.  Where are you from?  I'm from Rosebud.  Speak in native tongue.  What are you doing in Rosebud?  What are you doing?  I work for a living, man.  I went to firefighting school.  Remember, just past Rosebud?  All right.  Then you get up in the firefighting.  You hike the mountains up there.  All right.  Thank you, Sean, from South Dakota.  Sean in Jersey, real fast, because we've got to move on.  We've got NXS waiting outside the studio.  All right, hey, man. 
[03:19:30]  Good to meet you, Sean.  I was just wondering if the chief had a...  Parmlee, my name's...  All right, all right.  Sean?  Did you ever have to smoke the flesh-colored peace pipe in order to get some money on the street there?  Who hasn't?  All right, let's get him out of here.  I'm out of here now.  This dude made me crazy now.  Yeah, all right.  All right there, sir.  Thank you, sir.  I like your leather coat.  All right, cool.  That's Tippy Toms.  That's Tippy Toms?  Yeah.  David Toms.  Well, we traded.  I'm sure.  He got the coat, and Tom got to keep his teeth.  Right. 
[03:20:00]  Tippy Toms said I'm starting to get known by this coat.  Yeah?  So he's like, I guess I got to get rid of it.  So I gave him another black coat.  All right.  Take care, buddy.  You can use the door.  You don't have to go out the window.  Woo-woo now once.  Don't throw anything through the window.  He dropped something.  Okay, good.  All right.  No.  No, no, it's okay.  You didn't.  Oh, wait.  There is some right over there.  Didn't drop any.  No, over here.  Dude, there's Ash.  Give it a roll by him.  No, right over there.  Oh, Jesus.  It's Jimmy.  See, right there.  No, don't you dare. 
[03:20:30]  Over there.  You point over here.  I will kill you, Jimmy.  I will literally kill you.  I don't know what it is.  No, it's just it rolled, so he's just trying to get it.  All right.  All right.  We got you.  All right, gentlemen.  Oh, there it is.  By the floor, right by your feet.  Oh, that dollar.  Dude, it's right by your feet.  Yeah, there's a dollar right there.  See?  There it is.  That made my heart good because he was out there with his hands in his face complaining.  All right.  The homeless guy complaining that he had to wait a whole hour to come in here.  Yeah.  And he goes, he goes, Christ, I hope they give me money.  Yeah.  Eight bucks. 
[03:21:00]  I mean, that's a day.  He got a few bucks.  Okay.  We need to fumigate this place.  Raymond, the Amish comic, what are you promoting?  Nothing.  Hanging?  Nothing.  I have no job.  Want to help us out with In Excess?  They're coming in next.  I would be honored.  With their new lead singer.  They found a new lead singer.  Oh, they did?  Okay.  With the VH1 show they were doing?  They are going to be sickened by the smell in this place.  All right.  Why don't we step aside and we'll talk to...  I want some nice one.  In Excess with the new singer next.  There is nothing quite like a Cuban cigar. 
[03:21:30]  Right, Ramon?  The rich texture.  The full flavor.  So relaxing.  Oh, fiddlesticks.  No ashtray.  Ramon, open your mouth.  All right.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio. 
[03:22:00]  We got Raymond, the Amish comic.  He stopped by to say hi with some whoopie pies.  No one's partaking.  Jimmy did.  Oh, Jimmy tried.  He liked it.  Norton went down on that sucker mane.  He really did.  It was fantastic.  It really did.  I want to thank the homeless guy for stopping by, Keith the Cop.  He may be part of the homeless shopping spree.  Homeless shopping spree three.  Yeah.  Coming to the radio in the very near future.  We're trying to nail down an official date.  This year we're going to give out the mall in advance because we want a lot of the faithful  listeners to show up and help the homeless shop.  Right, Anthony?  Mm-hmm. 
[03:22:30]  All right.  Right now we got NXS coming into the studio to say hi.  I guess the publicist is really pissed off or something?  Yeah, that's what I hear.  Why?  I don't know.  Oh, all right.  Too many.  I waited too long, I think, is the problem.  The issue.  Hey, guys.  What's up, man?  There they are.  How good is it?  Good gentleman.  Sirs.  So the room's been disinfected?  We hope so.  We hope so.  It was...  Nice.  A charitable event.  How are you doing, man?  A charitable event.  A charitable event we're doing. 
[03:23:00]  Raymond, you want to let one of these guys grab a mic?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Jimmy, move over there.  Yeah, you guys.  One of you guys take this one.  Yeah, yeah.  And Raymond will move over.  We'll have a cozy moment.  Sorry to make you wait.  That's what happens with live radio.  I hear some of your people a little mad.  I hear the female in the group is very, very pissed off.  She's on her phone.  She wants answers.  I want answers.  We're running late.  What can I tell you?  We had a homeless guy in.  We're doing this homeless shopping spree where we do a nice thing for the homeless people  every year.  And we send them to a mall and let them shop. 
[03:23:30]  No way.  First time in quite a while.  Yeah, you got to talk on Mike there, bro.  Yeah, we actually do it every year.  We have a bunch of homeless people go shopping in a nice, fancy mall.  Yeah, and they get clothing and footwear, things they need for the year.  Cool.  Can I buy like a suitcase so they can get more stuff?  That could work.  What a great buy that would be.  Well, it turns out, yeah, what ends up happening is the listeners go to the mall that we pick  and they start buying stuff for the homeless.  It gets very, very festive.  It's very, very nice.  I saw a homeless guy in Toronto with a cell phone.  I'm like, who the fuck are you talking to, man? 
[03:24:00]  You know what I mean?  Burger and pizza or what?  Oh, that's right.  You're from Toronto, right?  Yeah, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I took a peek at that show.  At first, I was, you know, and then I got hooked.  I got hooked on the show.  It was very interesting.  Are you guys all Canadian?  No.  No, we're all Australian.  No, they're from Australia.  Hell yeah.  My cousin's actually from Toronto and his wife, Paul Bernardo and his wife.  Shut up.  You hear that all the time, right?  Really?  That's just wrong, man.  So you guys got great exposure doing this thing on VH1, huh? 
[03:24:30]  We never exposed ourselves, but yeah.  No, I understand that.  The show got good ratings.  How did that idea come about?  Mark Burnett came to you?  No, there's a gentleman right here.  We went to Mark Burnett and he loved the idea and we loved him and we did it.  Right.  It was pretty cool.  Some people had a problem with it, though, huh?  Thought it was a little morbid.  At first, man, the critics sort of dried up once they saw that, you know, there was  15 people out there slugging it out trying to follow their dreams.  It wasn't like there was a bunch of, you know, fucking, it was just perfectly timed 
[03:25:00]  that we all were wanting this so badly and the 15 of us lived in that house for three  months, man.  No TV, no radio, magazines, internet, no phone calls home and one of us walked away.  Yeah, the concept of the show, there was 15 of you guys trying to become the new lead  singer of NXS.  I thought it was a waste to have the women on the show because I didn't think you guys  would actually get a female.  I didn't.  That would, well, that would have changed the whole dynamic of the band, wouldn't it?  Yeah.  It was kind of the idea.  Oh, really?  Yeah, we seriously thought about that. 
[03:25:30]  I mean, big time.  Really?  Yeah.  Oof.  Because, because they're really.  Yeah, it's so hard to deal with, though, especially the band.  Yeah, I noticed there's a lot of men in this station and not very many women.  No, they don't fit in here.  Good posters, though.  And that's why we're very successful because, you know, they just bring us down.  We call, uh, women in radio, we call the holes.  They're just a hole.  They sit there.  Rock and roll lives in the holes right here.  Rock and roll lives in the holes, man.  And fuck everything up.  They sit there and go, oh, guys.  Now, now. 
[03:26:00]  Stop that.  They have feelings, too.  Like, things like that.  And you just, shut the fuck up.  Well, they do.  Yeah.  Exactly.  You don't need a chick in the band, though.  You don't want that, man.  Fucking dick.  Well, they chose, they chose, uh, the guy from China.  No, no, I know.  What I'm saying?  So why you?  You guys got daughters, or?  No.  No, no, no.  Hell no, man.  No, it's.  I'm out there with savages like you guys out there to fuck them.  Never.  No, it's baloney.  That's amazing.  Fucking dick.  No, it's, it's two different worlds. 
[03:26:30]  We live this radio world, and it's different than, uh, the real.  The real world.  Yeah.  We don't have daughters.  We fuck other people.  What do you think they do?  Six guys in a rock band?  A fucking chick looks like a mummy when they're finished with her.  By the way, by the way, I'm so turned off by that.  For the future of the planet.  I just noticed that.  Yeah, that's, uh, Jimmy's head on a female's body there.  So why you?  What was it about you that, uh, uh, was, was better than the other people?  Heart.  Yeah? 
[03:27:00]  Yeah.  Is that it?  Yeah.  I, uh, you know, just heart, man.  I followed my heart, and.  Is there a sound to your voice, look, something they were going for?  Oh, no, there was a lot of great sounds, a lot of great looks.  It's just what happened.  We all gelled together, and we came together.  It's kind of uncanny.  We feel like we've been a band for about ten years, man.  It's pretty cool.  Yeah, I mean, Jason went off and wrote a song, uh, to one of Andrew's, uh, penned already  pieces of music, and it, it sounded fantastic, and that's when our ears suddenly sat up, and  we went, oh, okay, this sounds kind of cool, you know, and he went out and wrote Pretty  Vegas, and that was when we sat up and took notes. 
[03:27:30]  The other time was when he escaped from the mansion, and, uh, he and Marty, and we knew  it was down to those two, because it was the kind of danger we wanted, you know.  Plus, I knew I could beat the crap out of everybody on the show, so.  Were you a fan of the band beforehand?  Yeah, man, a huge fan when I was growing up.  Yeah, I was amazing, yeah.  You know, posters on the wall.  Well, actually, I couldn't really afford posters, but I lived in a farmhouse, so I  had the EPs just opened up and tacked in with ACDC, NXS, and Bob Marley.  That was my life, I'm just trying to plug away songs on the guitar. 
[03:28:00]  Farmhouse, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  Grew up in the, on a farm.  Yeah, I did, man, Nova Scotia, yeah.  Nova Scotia.  That's usually where you find a farmhouse.  I thought it was a farmhouse in a big city somewhere.  Yeah.  It was really odd.  The only one.  Like Stuart Little, just right there.  Why did you guys decide to continue as a band, instead of maybe, uh, forming a new band  or a new project?  So we could do radio shows like this.  Well, you're being honest, right, because NXS has a lot of pull, obviously.  We didn't really stop. 
[03:28:30]  We kind of, uh, um, you know, after Michael died, which, by the way, is eight years today.  Wow.  So, um, wow.  We kind of, I don't know, we just started getting offers from promoters and things to  come and perform, and we're like, we don't have a singer.  And it just went from there.  So what were you guys doing in the last eight years?  Uh, we were performing, but what, just, uh, getting some guys to...  Yeah, we, we, we spent about three years with, uh, a New Zealand guy, John Stevens.  Um, just doing stuff, you know, kind of around the world, but mostly under the radar, because  we hadn't done anything new. 
[03:29:00]  Right.  Building farmhouses.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Did you guys go back to doing...  In the city?  Yeah.  Did you seriously go back to doing other things?  Sure.  Yeah.  I actually do work on a farm.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Farmers?  How hard is it, though, after being in the life and being, like, you know, like, one of the  biggest bands, all of a sudden, you're like, you're not there anymore.  It's got to be fucking awful.  Well, it's pretty cool, though.  Well, what is a big band?  Do you mean, like...  Dude, you guys...  Dude, please, you guys are really well-known.  You guys were huge.  You guys were probably get blown whenever you want, which to me is the most success with  any human being. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah, it's kind of, it is kind of hard, you know, when it's sort of all...  It all just seems to have fallen away, but, you know, we've, we always felt that, um,  we still had a lot more music to make and a lot more to do, and, you know, with Michael  departing the planet, it was kind of, it was obviously a shock, uh, and we weren't ready  to stop, you know, so we just had to find the right way to find the right singer, and  that's what the TV show did, you know?  Right, and then your record starts selling like crazy again, right?  With all your exposure?  The record comes out November 29th.  But, I mean, the back catalog started selling like crazy when you guys were trying to find 
[03:30:00]  the new lead singer.  Yeah, it's kind of cool.  Like, you know, we have a sort of cross-section now of fans, and, you know, younger fans are  coming up, and they're rediscovering, because the hits are still, the hits for a reason,  you know what I mean?  And music's a language, and if you speak it now, you speak it forever, you know, so...  Right.  Do you feel a little odd singing the old stuff?  No, not at all, man.  I feel right at home.  I get to live out my boyhood fantasies, which is great, you know?  And then, after the show, I get to live out my adult ones, so that's pretty cool.  These motherfuckers, right?  You gotta get to sleep one of these nights, J.  Yeah, I know, I know, I know. 
[03:30:30]  You're gonna burn out, man.  Are you just banging like crazy on the road?  Dude, sometimes I don't even have time to wonder...  No, I'm just kidding.  No, it's...  No, you're not.  He's not kidding.  No, all he does is bang.  That's all he's doing, is singing and banging.  You gotta get it on the fly, sort of thing, so it's kind of like...  No, I bought that brass handle downstairs, and we put it on the door, don't you?  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, man.  You know, secret code.  Are you guys all living secretly through him?  Yeah, you know, we all peek through the hole.  I can see my phone missing. 
[03:31:00]  Now, you see all sorts of things get born on a farm, you know?  Well, there's been some farm stories...  Female, it's amazing.  All sorts of things created as well.  Well, there's been some farm stories that have come out in the recent months.  Did you hear about the farm in Seattle?  No, what's that?  Where, uh...  Yeah, you could just go there and have sex with animals.  Have sex with animals?  If you wanted to.  Well, yeah.  Where is it?  Huh?  That's kind of sad.  And you know where it is?  Yeah.  Oh, no, it was a national...  Hey, you've got to be informed. 
[03:31:30]  It was a national story.  Was that called a fondling zoo?  It was a...  Are they male or female animals there?  Is that going to fond you?  Hey, Timmy, what's that?  Timmy, why do you fuck a sheep on its back?  Uh, so you can kiss it.  There you go.  It was a national story, and a guy took a horse cock right up the hill.  Yeah, he died.  Oh, way.  And he died, and then the...  And that AI did eat the pipe in the semen store, or was it?  And then the farm was exposed for a place where, like, people knew they could go there and have sex with animals. 
[03:32:00]  Anything you want?  We have the video, actually.  We have the video.  Well, I don't know if we officially have the video.  I'd like that.  Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.  Also, personally, I prefer eggs, you know, but...  Yeah, from the chicken.  Not fucking it.  All right.  It's up to you guys.  Let's go to Sanford, California.  Oh, Sanford in California.  Sorry.  What's up, Sanford?  Yeah, just...  I'm from Australia, living out here.  I'm really big fans of NXS.  I think you guys are freaking awesome.  Really sad to hear about when Michael died. 
[03:32:30]  And just wanted to know when you guys are going to be touring again.  Yeah, we start January the 18th in Vancouver, and we'll be all over the U.S. and Canada throughout  that period.  We go home to Australia for about five weeks, I think.  Right.  And then back over here shortly after March.  Are you doing any gigs out in California?  Yeah, we are.  We're playing out in, yeah, about four or five shows out in California.  Just check out the website, NXS.com, and it's got all the listings there. 
[03:33:00]  Sweet, guys.  Right on, man.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Punch it out.  Thanks, Mark.  You going to try to pick up an Australian accent?  Sometimes.  Well, I've got a sort of Canadian accent, and the more I, you know, have a few...  Canadian accent.  It comes out a little bit, you know.  Canadian accent.  As far as girls go, Canadian accent is so lame compared to the Oscars.  If any Aussie could just come to this country and start fucking rapping with chicks, and  it's over, Johnny.  You know, I'm just jumping on them.  I was sitting there at the bar going, do you want to go out for a... 
[03:33:30]  Oot, oot, oot, oot, oot.  And I was like, these guys are talking about fucking...  I'm going to my hotel room.  Yeah.  I'm going with him.  It's true, though.  Horses don't really care about it, actually.  Horses don't care.  Donkeys do.  Well, actually, what goes around, comes around.  You know, I used to live in England for only five years, and they hang shit on us there,  so don't worry.  Really?  Even better, you get a boarding pass when you come to the U.S., and it's got SSSS on it.  When we figured out, I mean, super special treatment.  Ooh.  Super special treatment.  Let's see what's in the bag. 
[03:34:00]  They really treat you like shit in England?  Really see what's in the bag.  Oh, yeah.  It always does, yeah.  Even me coming now, now with the life after 9-11, stuff like that, I have a working visa in  the States, and, like, I don't know what it is, man, but they, you know,  I'm Canadian.  We're the most unthreatening people on the planet.  Yeah, what are you guys going to do?  And it's like, you know, I get the customs guys, and you're probably listening now, I'm  getting shit today, but I get literally, let's see your ID, and it's, like, every time,  let's see what's in your bag, what's da-da-da, what's da-da-da-da, and it's just...  Like, you're the threat.  I guess they'll be keeping on it for you now, right?  I'm from Canada, too.  We know what the threat looks like. 
[03:34:30]  It doesn't look like in excess.  It's Canadian.  Bad jokes.  It's a lot of scint in your bag.  Right.  We gave you South Park mother effer.  You know what I mean?  Those guys claim Canada.  Oh, yeah.  They're from Colorado.  Yeah.  Let's go to Tom in Indiana.  Tom, what's up?  How much, man?  Hey, J.D., I got a question.  I want to know if Pretty Vegas is going to be on a new album, dude, because that's the  most rockin'est song I've heard since they did Mystify.  Oh, right on, man.  Thanks a lot, bro.  Yeah, it's going to be on the new record.  It comes out the 29th.  You can pick it up.  I think it's track number three, dude. 
[03:35:00]  Sweet.  I appreciate it.  Look forward to seeing you.  Number two, man, sir.  I'll have a good one.  Hey, thanks a lot, bro.  Hang in there.  Hey, weren't you close to making it as a singer before this opportunity came about?  Actually, yeah.  I was in a band that was really sort of progressive punk.  It was called Juice, and they're out of Toronto.  How pissed are those guys?  Yeah.  What happened was I sort of left that band and just started doing some spoken word poetry  and get my writing together and literally ended up living out of my car for a couple 
[03:35:30]  months.  Did you have a record deal with the old band?  They had a publishing deal, and what was really funny was when I auditioned for that  band, they had a singer that quit, and they told me that they had a record deal.  So I learned like 14 rap core tunes within like nine days and then had a showcase for  the label, and I thought it was like, oh, we're getting signed.  I'm going to get this check, and everything's going to be cool, and it turned out it was  actually just like a showcase for the A&R.  They weren't signed, and even their manager was like, yeah, we're signed. 
[03:36:00]  Don't worry about it.  We're signed.  I'm like, cool.  Great.  Got a record deal.  It's all good, and it turns out they didn't.  Everyone looking for a new member has some kind of deal.  If you look in the classifieds of some of the papers, it was always like, lucrative deal  waiting, just need the right guy.  It's like, yeah, sure, okay.  Please invest $1,400.  Already signed.  Just need drummer, bass player, guitarist.  It's like, what the fuck did they sign you for?  Must have owned van.  That's what you know, it's a lucrative deal.  Complete thin picture of van. 
[03:36:30]  Must have owned shit.  No attitudes.  Apparently, I'm running in the van because I had a van.  You're the van guy.  These guys had to go through the same shit you did, Anthony.  Oh, it's just so much fun.  I left for radio, by the way.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I had a band, and those guys, to this day, it's like 11 years, and they're still  pissed.  Do they still give you shit?  Yeah.  Still get shit every so often, motherfucker.  They're still convinced that the big comeback tour is going to happen.  Yeah.  I get the call every year.  Dude, you want to just get back together?  We'll do a couple of gigs and see what happens. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah, yeah.  You're still in denial, Rob.  I'll be right there.  Yeah, absolutely.  I'm sure you don't give him shit about your decision.  Yeah.  No, I get some shit every so often.  My brother was in the band, and if I didn't cut him a check every fucking month, he'd give  me shit, too.  Oh, no.  It's fun.  The band doesn't really talk to me that much.  No.  No, no.  They didn't like Opie.  They're fairly polite.  Yoko.  Yoko Opie is polite to me, so I took Anthony away from something.  Right on, dude.  Well, goddamn, man.  It's great to see you guys actually work it out. 
[03:37:30]  A lot of guys, you know, the singer either dies or leaves, and the band's done.  You guys...  Well, you and the other guy that were in the finals both sounded just like Michael when  you were singing those songs.  And what were you guys thinking?  Because it got pretty emotional on the show when these guys were singing the old NXS songs.  You guys were practically crying right on TV there.  We were just complete wrecks.  I mean, it was the most stressful thing for us, but no one slept because everyone's going,  you know, just weighing up all the options, and everyone was so talented towards the  end there.  And we really were, honestly, coming into this competition, you know, expecting, you 
[03:38:00]  know, fully to accept a woman, and that was one of the other weird things.  I'm still not buying that, by the way.  No, man.  Yeah, I'm glad I brought that back up.  I'm not going to buy that.  And moving right along, you know.  I'm not going to buy that one.  Thanks, John.  You're not talking to a morning zoo.  We're not buying that one.  You're pretty cool with the cross-dressing and everything.  He touches my feminine side.  Yeah.  It is kind of something that you don't want to be a tribute band of yourself, where you get  a singer that either looks or sounds exactly like Michael, but you do want a guy, because 
[03:38:30]  the people do want to hear the hits, and they want to hear them the way they sounded.  Yeah.  So it's kind of a...  That's why we got the record, too, man, because it makes sense.  If it was just to do that, you know, to just do the back catalog, then, I mean, really,  they could tour with whoever they want and just keep having guests for the rest of their  careers.  We got a copy of the songs here, right?  Switch, right?  Yeah, we could play that.  We should throw it if you want to.  We'll play Pretty Vegas at the end of the show.  And that's the cool thing.  We actually have a great product.  We've really worked hard, and we wrote, and we wrote and killed ourselves for five weeks 
[03:39:00]  from start to finish to do a full record produced by Guy Chambers.  And, I mean, it was literally full-on 18 hours a day, three studios simultaneously.  We're recording here, writing here, and doing this, and going like that.  And that was the day after the show finished.  So, it was like, you got the gig, so now it's fucking time to work, you know?  Let's say hi to Jennifer in New Jersey.  She wants to bang JD at the Philly show.  Jennifer.  Hi, guys.  How are you?  Do you want to bang JD?  I would love to.  You're a slut. 
[03:39:30]  I like my girls either slutty or intelligent, so what school did you go to?  I'm also 5'10".  How tall are you?  I'm 6'2 and a bit.  Beautiful.  5'10", how much do you weigh?  130.  130.  Nice.  It's nice.  It's acceptable.  Do you live in a farm?  She's a wood farm girl.  5'10", 130.  Have you been fucking Popeye?  No, I'm perfectly proportioned.  I could bounce you on my knee, Jimmy.  All right.  Well, you're going to have to knock down the stage door. 
[03:40:00]  Yeah.  We're running out of show, and we want to get a piece of their latest song, Pretty Vegas,  on the radio.  Guys, thank you.  What are we plugging?  What are we plugging?  The record?  The record comes out November 29th, one week from today.  Switch.  And NXS.com for four days.  All right.  We'll leave until you're a homeless-hating publicist that don't worry about things so  much.  She's our manager, actually.  Oh, manager?  Oh, really?  Wonderful.  She's from New York.  Good luck with that.  Yeah, man.  Here's NXS in Pretty Vegas as we end the show today.  Check it out. 
[03:40:30]  Love you guys, man.  Thanks for having me.  Thanks for having me.  Thanks for having me.  Thanks for having me.  Falling asleep every wheel again, baby.  You're drifting over the line, line, yeah.  Your hands are tied, but you're losing grip quickly.  Fix me, can you read the signs?  Coming your way to Vegas, steady and dreaming of the other side.  Save me on tears and laughter, because it doesn't matter what you find.  It ain't pretty, and I've done that show. 
[03:41:00]  It ain't pretty when the brain leaves you, and no place to go.  If you think you need it, here's the place to be in.  But it ain't pretty.  Gotcha, and I'm out of here. </pre>
