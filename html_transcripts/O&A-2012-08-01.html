<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Anthony recounting a frustrating encounter with the Nassau County police, called due to a noise complaint from his neighbor.  The "domestic disturbance" was actually boisterous poolside revelry, including Anthony’s Steve Buscemi impressions.  He revealed the police were familiar with the show, having previously responded to a noise complaint involving (allegedly) nude women smoking marijuana. Anthony called his neighbor a "cunt" and a "bitch," speculating the "domestic disturbance" call was a strategic move to ensure a quicker police response. The hosts discussed neighborhood dynamics on Long Island and varying noise tolerance levels. Anthony also plugged his upcoming August and Labor Day parties.

The conversation shifted to the Olympics, with Anthony criticizing the appearance of some athletes, calling one gymnast a "pygmy" and mocking another swimmer's speech impediment and looks, playing clips of her post-gold medal interview for comedic effect. They then discussed a badminton match where players intentionally lost to avoid playing China.  The segment ended with a discussion of MTV's early music videos, prompting Anthony to share a personal anecdote about finding a lyric sheet from Thompson Twins' "Hold Me Now" pinned to his dorm room wall, leading to reminiscing about college and a near-rape incident in Buffalo.

The next segment focused on the hosts' past relationships, detailing one host's past relationship and the song ("Hold Me Now") he wrote about it, using graphic and sexually explicit language.  This transitioned into a comparison of Samsung Galaxy and iPhone phones, focusing on features, volume, camera quality, and operating systems. One host favored the Samsung Galaxy. A caller shared a post-coital anecdote. The segment concluded with further discussion of smartphones and reminiscing about past relationships.

A chaotic discussion about mobile phones and the Facebook stock market crash followed.  The hosts debated the Samsung Galaxy S3 versus the iPhone, highlighting the Galaxy S3's facial recognition. A caller, Mike from Philly, confirmed having the Bank of America app on his Android.  Guest "Big A," a Galaxy S3 owner, explained its features, particularly the confusing palm-based screenshot function.  The conversation veered towards Big A’s feelings about his past appearances on the Ron and Fez show.  A significant portion covered one host's significant financial losses from the Facebook crash.  The hosts extensively reminisced about *The Breakfast Club*, quoting lines, discussing characters, and debating Molly Ringwald's attractiveness.  A video clip of the controversial badminton match further fueled humorous and profane discussion. The segment ended with an argument about obtaining donuts, accusing producer Roland of lying about flea market donuts.

The following segment started with a request for Dodo Donuts and complaints about incompetent interns' computer skills.  This transitioned to commentary on a fencing match. The main focus became a heated discussion about E-Rock (an intern's supervisor) allegedly keeping his hand on Opie's sister's leg for an extended period while showing her photos of his new house at Opie's home.  The discussion involved interruptions, accusations, denials, and an attempt to recreate the event with an intern. E-Rock ranked those he was most upset with, placing Opie first.  The conversation included sexually suggestive remarks and vulgar language, speculating about the contact's intentionality.  Roland and Troy were mentioned, and there was speculation about what Opie's sister might have said, but no resolution was reached.

The final segment involved ranking show personnel by friendship/favoritism. The banter turned vulgar, with accusations of being a "piece of shit" and commentary on one host's "vinegary" belly button odor.  The ranking was revealed: Opie first, Troy second, with mentions of Roland and E-Rock. Apologies were offered to E-Rock, followed by more insults, the hosts' desire to leave, and a nonsensical song about E-Rock.  The overall tone was informal, combative, and heavily profane.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning. Welcome aboard.  Enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  And with that, we say good morning to everybody.  Yet again. Yet again.  I was asking Sam before the show, when does this end?  When does this nonsense end?  It's like a TV series. It doesn't end.  Really? It goes on and on.  On and on and on.  You're like a long-running TV show, like Gunsmoke. 
[00:00:30]  Wow. You know? You know what?  Yeah.  Wow.  We are.  We're in our 18th season.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  Do it again.  I never expected longevity with this whole thing.  No, it's insanity.  Here we get a few years in, make a few bucks, and move on.  Make a few quick bucks.  We're in season 18. Are you kidding me?  Before the management, that bee, is on to us. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  Realizes we're frauds.  Oh, yeah.  They're frauds. Fuck them.  I ain't dealing with that shit.  We're not frauds. They're frauds.  How's everybody?  What a great morning.  Why?  I don't know.  Say that.  It's not.  It's just another morning.  I had a cop at my house last night.  Why?  I don't know.  I think a neighbor called and thought it was a domestic going on.  It's just fun. 
[00:01:30]  Did you have a domestic?  It was just fun going on.  It was just fun, but they thought it was a domestic?  I was a man.  My buddy comes over every so often.  He's a law enforcement.  Domestic with a buddy?  He's law enforcement.  Spelled B-U-T-T-Y.  No.  Yes.  He's a friend of mine.  I don't know.  The music wasn't loud.  And I honestly, I know Jimmy's been there.  Jimmy has been there and has known. 
[00:02:00]  Jimmy has talked about the music in your house.  Yes.  It's uncomfortable.  Jimmy says it gets uncomfortable.  I got this for a second.  Jimmy says it's uncomfortable and he turns to you and goes, look, it's real.  And I said, by the fence, it's not that loud.  Yeah, exactly.  And then he goes by the fence and goes, yes, it's the same volume here.  It was 10 feet over there.  And I talk like there's acres.  Yeah.  It's loud everywhere.  What are you talking about?  Like there's big thick glass between the fence and there's a clue that's not.  What does he go?  No, the speakers are facing this way, so we're okay. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  Have you pulled that one yet?  Yeah.  Because the speakers do kind of face a little downward.  So in certain parts of the yard, it will be louder than other places.  But it wasn't the music.  It wasn't.  I think we were just like laughing and yelling in the pool.  Yelling over the music so you can hear each other.  No, it was like, yeah.  Like, you know when you do an impression of something?  I do these impressions.  You'd think it was the real people.  And I do the impressions. 
[00:03:00]  And sometimes you've got to yell to do them because that's the sound.  And I think I was doing some impressions of Steve Buscemi from Fargo.  And it's like, you know, give me the fucking money!  You know, that shit.  Oh, nice.  Yeah, yeah.  I can see why they thought there was a domestic hole.  King clip-on fucking tie.  You know, that shit.  Right.  And then I hear, hello!  Hello!  By the gate.  And I'm like, oh, what the fuck is that?  I turn around. 
[00:03:30]  And it's by the locks gate, actually.  And I said, you've got to go to the other gate.  Come around the other side.  And really quickly...  They came around the other side.  Four Nassau County policemen were in my yard.  Uh-oh.  And I was talking to them, and apparently they knew the show.  One of them had been to my house prior, a few years ago, for a noise complaint, and had 
[00:04:00]  stood waiting by the gate for a while, and observed nude women smoking marijuana cigarettes,  I believe.  Why are you admitting all this?  Well, that was a while ago.  Well, allegedly.  I'm not saying they were.  I'm just saying that's what they said they had observed.  And this was years ago.  But you're not going to admit that they were just looking in a way, right?  No, no, no, not at all.  They did their job.  They came up.  I'm just trying to help you out.  They observed.  They saw what the complaint was about, noticed that nothing was really going on, and went 
[00:04:30]  about their way.  Last night, they said that they had gotten a call and were checking it out.  And they realized when they came back that it was no big deal.  Yeah, just a couple of queers frolicking in the hot tub.  A couple of queers.  Just a normal Tuesday night for you, right?  Just hanging out.  As the neighbors are trying to sleep.  Trying to sleep.  Why wouldn't you do Steve Buscemi at midnight outdoors? 
[00:05:00]  You know, on a Tuesday.  And I'm just flying my helicopter around through neighbor's yards and whatnot.  It was fun.  They love you, right?  The neighbors?  They got to.  Come on now.  A little excitement.  I mean, your houses are kind of close together, but that's how it is on Long Island.  I mean, obviously, a very nice spread you got.  Look, I would love to have.  It's not like you're in the middle of the woods where your neighbors are far away, and  this shit wouldn't happen.  I would love that, but I can't have that because I have to come into work every day  in the city.  So the closer you are to the city, it's less land, obviously, for people that don't know. 
[00:05:30]  I could move way out to Suffolk County and have a palace, and no one would bother me,  but then I would be miserable here because my commute would be three hours a day.  So hence, you got the neighbors a little closer than you would like.  Yeah, and someone fucking called.  The fuck is that about?  You're mad at them.  Yes, because here's the deal.  How are you mad at them on a Tuesday?  Because here's the deal.  They know me by now. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, but that doesn't mean they have to deal with it.  No, they do.  They do.  They do, because I wasn't being crazy loud, and they didn't call a noise complaint, because  the cops wouldn't fucking show up, so they call a domestic, knowing me.  In all the years, I've never had a domestic at my house.  They won't show up for a noise complaint?  Eh, they'd probably look and say, oh, it's Anthony.  Who gives a shit?  Well, domestic gets people moving.  Yes. 
[00:06:30]  They have to at least check it out.  So some fucking neighbor is now on to, you know.  Can I play the other side here?  No, you certainly can.  Okay.  And no disrespect, sir.  They've probably tried the noise complaint a million fucking times, and they get no action,  so they're like, well, motherfucker, what can we do now?  So then they go with the domestic.  You know what?  That's all I'm saying.  Here's what you do.  I'm not an unreasonable guy.  Come to the fence, and go like, hey, excuse me, excuse me, my baby's trying to sleep. 
[00:07:00]  I'm an asshole and hate fucking people having fun in this neighborhood.  On a Tuesday.  Anything.  On a Tuesday.  Why is Tuesday?  Is Tuesday no fun day?  You're right.  Is Tuesday no fun day?  Let's break it down.  I think.  Break it down.  Oh, oh, oh.  I think if you have relatively cool neighbors, they will give you a Thursday.  They will give you a Friday.  They certainly will give you a Saturday, and they will give you most of a Sunday. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  So I think Monday and Tuesday are those days where they're like, I've had it.  You know, Manic Monday, that's my fun day.  And so is Tuesday.  Why can't I have fun on Tuesday?  And the other thing, because I'm a good listener.  I have the feeling that your neighbors are petrified of you, sir.  Or they might be.  And they probably see a thing or two in that backyard.  So I don't think it's an option for them to just peek over the fence and say, excuse 
[00:08:00]  me, sir.  They should.  And I know what neighbor is.  Have you ever fucking know which one it is?  Which one is it?  It's the one that isn't cool.  It's the one in my neighborhood.  Wait, you got one cool neighbor and one not so cool?  Every other neighbor is cool, except for this one.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's not bad.  And I'll tell you who it is.  This?  It's, no, no, he's cool.  Oh.  He's cool.  Really?  I thought it'd be him.  Look around my neighborhood.  Notice the houses that have not, no, no, no. 
[00:08:30]  I'm sorry.  Notice the houses that have been, that have been knocked down and bigger, what they call  McMansions, have been built in their place.  Those people are cool.  Those people are cool.  So it's, it's this holdout fucking cunt rag in this piece of shit 1955 house that he doesn't  fucking want anyone having fun in the neighborhood.  An old timer who kind of liked the neighborhood when he moved in a long time ago.  Probably. 
[00:09:00]  You mean when a man could sleep on a Tuesday at 1230 without hearing Steve Buscemi impressions  from a drunken off-duty police officer and radio host?  And he has to yell the impressions because he's half deaf?  Come on now.  Let's be honest, we're all half deaf.  So loud to you is different than loud to others.  But it wasn't, it really wasn't.  I've had the music up full blast and it does get loud.  On purpose, it wasn't that loud. 
[00:09:30]  It really wasn't.  And there was just a couple of outbursts of Steve Buscemi impressions.  I would love this.  I can't take that.  These are the type of videos that would be awesome.  I can't do that.  I was taping some of the helicopter.  Yeah, but you don't have to see like.  I was buzzing around the yards with my helicopter.  Yeah.  No, it was just fun.  Yeah, the footage is pretty cool.  Yeah, it's fun.  Saw a little of that before the show.  I just, I don't care.  So the cops left and did they at least tell you to turn down the music?  No, because it wasn't loud.  I swear it wasn't loud. 
[00:10:00]  Wow, so the neighbor fucked himself because now the cops leave, there's no domestic, so  now he doesn't get the music turned down because that's the real reason why he called.  Well, I did invite them to my big August party.  They will be showing up at my big August party.  What is the big August party?  Well, it's kind of a friends and family party.  Oh, it's not a Labor Day party?  Not complete debauchery.  No, no, Labor Day party is going to be something different.  Oh, so you've got an August party and a Labor Day party.  Yeah, this is the mid-August family friends party, where it's not complete debauchery of 
[00:10:30]  people that, you know, like anyone can come.  You think your neighbors have a calendar, like just counting down the days to the first  snowfall?  They hate summer.  Oh, do they hate summer.  They probably sleep during the day because they just know that they're not going to be  able to sleep at night.  They're all fucking napping in the afternoon.  How close is this neighbor?  You know what?  As far as the bordering right on my property neighbors go, further than all the other neighbors. 
[00:11:00]  Wow.  Wow.  Your music must be really loud.  No, she's a cunt.  She's fucking a bitch, man.  She's the one that called the cops on me years ago, too.  I know what you want to say.  She's a bummer.  She's a bummer, dude.  How old is she?  She's a bummer.  I don't know, but when I hear music coming from there, it's always like Crosby, Stills,  Nash, and Young.  Oh, so she's kind of an old hippie, man.  Yeah.  She should understand a little bit.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Thank you.  Look, I don't care, by the way.  I'm just trying to vent this out and get some radio out of it. 
[00:11:30]  Playing the cunt's advocate.  I get it.  No, not at all.  I get it.  Those fucking...  I can't stand it.  It's like, come on.  Maybe offer some pot or something.  Nah.  I don't even fucking talk to that neighbor.  The other neighbors I talk to.  Do they come over ever?  No.  Why don't you...  Do you invite the neighbors to the party?  The other neighbors are cool.  They pop...  Like, all right, earlier in the evening, I was fucking around with the helicopter, and  I had it hovering over the neighbor's driveway and stuff, because they had their kids over 
[00:12:00]  there and stuff, so they were like...  Oh, boy.  No, no.  They were being fun and everything.  Oh, boy.  They're like, lower, lower.  You're going younger.  Oh, my God.  No, no, no.  I swear.  I swear.  It was just fucking around.  Like, having fun.  Oh, there's more to the story?  I'm sorry.  What happened?  No, no, no, no.  I just heard my helicopter that shoots video in little kids.  What happened?  No, it was just...  They, like, have fun.  They were like, lower, lower, lower.  Oh, let me see.  No.  Yeah, they start yelling, right?  No, but the nanny and the mom were in the driveway also. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, okay.  And the kids were just having fun.  I should have listened.  The kids were just having fun.  Right.  They were like, oh, and they, they, they, like, were all excited.  Yeah, they were all excited that there was, like, a helicopter flying over their house.  Were you making them bend over to pick up the helicopter?  No.  Wave to the helicopter, hi.  See, this is where everybody gets all fucked up.  Were you having a handstand party?  No.  What was going on?  I was just flying the helicopter around the yard.  I just want to make sure everybody's laughing. 
[00:13:00]  They, they, they love it, you know.  Sure.  They had a little interaction with the neighbor's kids.  And, and the parents.  Were they jumping up yelling, heck, hop, the heck, hop, the heck, hop, the heck.  No.  No, they weren't.  When did the, they were having fun.  When did the parents come running out of the house in a panic?  They were hanging out in the driveway and they were enjoying the fact that the kids were,  like, they were, they were having fun looking at the helicopter.  Were you lifting a little girl up over your head going, touch the helicopter?  No.  Listen to the sound it makes.  No. 
[00:13:30]  It wasn't a helicopter like that.  It's a real helicopter.  You're an awful man.  Yay.  Your dress is yellow.  Listen to the helicopter.  And, and the neighbor was cool.  The neighbor was totally cool.  The neighbor was like, oh yeah, the kids are, oh, they love watching it fly over the house.  Like, oh, you know, that's cool.  And, and that neighbor's fine.  And that neighbor's the one that also needed all of us neighbors next to them 
[00:14:00]  to sign a variance that said that we didn't mind that they had a closed-in garage  because it was over the square footage of the house.  So they owe you a favor.  So they'll never complain, and they're cool.  They owe you a favor.  And they're cool.  The neighbor's on the other side of me.  You're doing old-school mafia shit.  That guy's fine, too.  Really?  He's cool.  He belongs to the same pistol range that I go to,  and everything's cool with him.  The Chinese guy behind me, he's cool.  We talk over the fence about gardening. 
[00:14:30]  You don't garden.  Well, no, my landscapers do, so I talk about my flowers.  Oh, okay.  I know what I have back there.  What do you got back there?  Some buttercups.  You have buttercups?  I have no idea.  I don't know what the fuck they are, but I try to fake it.  Buttercups are a little rough, bro.  But he's cool.  A little rough, bro.  But then there's the back next to the Chinese neighbor guy,  kind of at an angle to my house neighbor.  The first away.  There's a fucking piece of shit that won't leave me alone.  I'm having fun.  What?  You don't like the sounds of fun? 
[00:15:00]  On a Tuesday night at 1230.  Who gives a shit?  I think you're right on this one.  1230 is not fucking that late.  Yeah.  It's really not.  I don't know what to say about that.  For the Irish working Joe, 1230 is pretty rough.  I'm here.  6A.  You're an anomaly.  6A, motherfucker.  You're an anomaly.  Trust me.  I'm not going to.  I said anomaly.  What's he going to pass?  I'm thinking of anomaly.  What about like a Vietnomaly or something?  That's not funny.  A lot of people died there.  Oh, well, sorry.  Quite frankly, I don't even know how you do it. 
[00:15:30]  Quite frankly, I don't even know how you do it.  I don't either.  What time did you go to bed?  First of all, I went to sleep.  Yes.  By 1015, I'm in bed.  They don't get to do that.  They don't know that.  They're not allowed to do that.  They just started their work day.  Oh, I never realized that they don't get to nap.  You might be on different schedules.  That's what I'm getting at.  1230 for most people.  Live your life.  You get in a great neighborhood, a great house.  You got a great neighbor, me.  Just enjoy looking over the fence. 
[00:16:00]  Just enjoy you?  Live vicariously through me, motherfucker.  Enjoy you?  Have fun.  What's the average time people go to bed?  11?  Sometimes after the local news.  So they've been in bed probably an hour to an hour and a half.  And then they hear you doing your far-go impression.  The Olympics was still on.  Put down that fucking money!  It's great.  What did you say?  Somebody shot me!  What?  I got shot in the fucking face! 
[00:16:30]  You got to hear that.  Who's cursing at this hour?  So what time did you crash after the complaint?  Well, after the cops showed up, I decided perhaps I should take it inside.  Oh, you did?  And go for a little karaoke.  Yeah.  Karaoke?  So it was karaoke time.  At what time?  Maybe two.  Holy...  How do you do it?  I slept...  I don't even know how you do it.  But I slept from the time I got home... 
[00:17:00]  Right.  ...until into the afternoon.  Wow.  I sleep.  And it's that way I'm able to have fun that my neighbors don't fucking enjoy.  My fun.  But I have fun.  Don't you second-guess me, Sam.  What if you did karaoke in the afternoon and slept at night?  No, I'm exhausted when I get home.  What?  Because I've been up all night.  If you did these activities...  Yeah, all you have to do is a slight...  All you have to do is a slight adjustment, and you'd be good. 
[00:17:30]  If the neighbor knocked on my door and handed me a slip that said,  uh, I want to sing ABBA, here's the song, I would fucking cue it up,  and they would be having a fun...  They'd be having fun, too.  What does this lady look like?  Have you ever seen her?  Only through the lens of my remote-controlled drone helicopter.  When I pop it over the fence and see what the neighbors are doing.  When they sit out during the afternoon playing old folk music, 
[00:18:00]  like Dylan and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young,  and fucking, like, Joni Mitchell, shit like that.  That's hippies.  That's hippies.  Old hippie, though.  It's like, oh, God.  That's like early hippies, right?  But I've seen them.  That could be Woodstock hippies.  I've seen them.  They've got, like, a dog.  69, 49, 51.  They're probably 63-ish.  Yeah, and the jacuzzi's like...  Most early 60s.  The jacuzzi kind of borders their fence and stuff,  so they might hear that.  But, you know, you know what?  Don't call the fucking cops. 
[00:18:30]  They've got better shit to do.  So it's Nassau County.  There's a cat to get out of a tree or something.  There you go.  There's a firehouse parking lot to pull into  with the cars going one way and the other way  to talk to each other.  Oh, really?  Come on now.  They're very busy.  Not much going on.  It's Nassau.  What are you getting?  What about the home invasions?  Well, that's true.  They do like a good home invasion.  But mostly it's D-Wee tickets  and scraping kids off the fucking pavement.  That's pretty much Nassau County. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  I would think.  Well, you had the wrong way driver on L.A. recently.  Yes.  How the fuck do you do that?  I don't know.  It seems like a real hassle to get on the expressway the wrong way.  That would be pretty amazing to do.  I don't even know how you do it.  You've got to hang a really hard turn.  Sharp.  You've got to go sharp.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm trying to even think.  You would have to go on the entrance and then make that sharp left, I guess.  Yeah.  You're on the service road, right?  And then you've got to make a hard, sharp left. 
[00:19:30]  Well, wait a minute.  No, no.  No.  Because that's the...  You'd have to get onto the L.A. and then make your weird left and then drive into traffic.  Wait.  On the off-ramp.  So you're on the service road.  You make that hard left on the off-ramp and now you're going the wrong way.  I think that's what you do.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  I don't know how you do it, but...  Those assholes get one every once in a while.  So fucking past it.  Can you imagine the feeling you'd have if you're driving down the highway and a car's  coming at you?  Oh, my God. 
[00:20:00]  Holy fuck.  That's frightening.  I mean, you've looked out the window when you're flying, right?  And you see the jets going the other way and you can barely see them?  Yes.  Isn't it a weird, scary feeling to look like when you look down and you see a plane zipping  by going the other way?  I don't know why.  It's because you're not used to seeing anything up there.  Yeah.  It just feels lonely.  You can't see something.  The New York to L.A. flights, you'll see the planes going the other way in the distance  because it's almost like a highway up there or whatever.  And what is it like?  It's like it's going 800 miles an hour? 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, closing speed.  You're going 400.  They're going 400.  Yeah.  Even more sometimes.  Closer to 1,000.  You see these things.  It doesn't look real.  Yeah.  How it shoots across the sky when you're looking.  Yeah, when you see something relative to your fucking speed, it's pretty cool.  Yes.  Yeah.  The 2012 Olympics.  You watched it all last night?  Yeah.  I watched a little water polo until I got completely fucking disinterested after five minutes. 
[00:21:00]  I'm getting bored with the Olympics.  That was it with the Olympics.  Yeah.  I'm starting to bore out, too.  I'm getting bored.  The swimming.  How much swimming can you watch?  Who cares after a while?  Women's gymnastics, though.  I was watching that.  USA won the gold?  Oh, that Mikayla girl is just an evil little bitch.  What about the one that looks like a pygmy?  Which one?  They all fucking look short.  No, Gabby looks like a pygmy.  Gabby?  Oh, boy.  That's not nice.  That's racist.  Is it?  I don't know. 
[00:21:30]  Is it?  Well, I've never seen a white pygmy.  I'm sorry.  I never did either, but...  How is that racist?  I don't know.  If only blacks could be pygmies.  Because if you talk about black people, it's racist.  That's pretty much...  Yeah.  It doesn't matter what you say.  I don't mean anybody.  It's just an observation.  She has very small features.  She really does.  That's kind of weird.  Yeah.  Yeah, she does.  She has a little tiny thing.  Should I apologize now for saying pygmy?  Yeah, you probably should.  I don't think pygmy has been used on the radio for 10 years.  One of America's sweethearts. 
[00:22:00]  She really is, and she won gold, and congratulations.  She just looks a little weird to me, that's all.  Keep up your good nature.  Let me see a little gal.  What's her name?  Gabby something.  Yeah.  There she is.  She's on the TV.  There's Gabby.  Oh, that's not her.  No, that's not.  No, this is the old...  That's past.  This is old school.  See, you can't even tell the difference.  They're all little troll-y fucking mutant little things.  There you go.  There she is.  She's got weird little features.  Aw.  I don't know.  Good for the U.S.  She does look weird, though. 
[00:22:30]  How old is she?  16, 17, somewhere around there.  They'd like him to be about 16 if they're Jimmy.  She looks like Todd Bridges in 1978.  There's something going on there, right?  She looks like a young Todd Bridges.  Yeah, there is something going on.  She looks a little different.  I don't know.  Did you see the women's swimmer there who talks really funny?  No.  Which one?  Oh, my God.  What's her name?  She's like America's sweetheart.  Schmidt.  Thank you, Iraq.  Oh, the Schmidt one? 
[00:23:00]  Did you see her?  They interviewed her after she won the gold?  Was it Mary?  Did Mary interview her?  You sold your swam, and it's one of your personal best.  How did you feel about that?  Could you get the interview of her after she won the gold medal?  Possibly because I swear to you, if you were just flipping around the TV and this came on,  you would think for a split second you were watching the Special Olympics. 
[00:23:30]  I've got to say it.  I've got to say it.  Really?  Retard face?  It's how she talks, too.  Oh, okay.  And she's another one of America's sweethearts, so maybe we shouldn't say this.  It's not Franklin.  Huh?  No, not Missy Frank.  No, not Missy.  No, it's Schmidt.  I guess she trains with Michael Phelps.  There's Schmidt right there.  We need the interview part, though, Sam.  We need the interview.  Yes, Sam.  Maybe just any interview.  Allison.  Allison Schmidt.  Allison Schmidt.  I was expecting her, but I was trying to go fast. 
[00:24:00]  I was like, hey, by the time.  I didn't know.  What's wrong with her?  She sounds deaf.  Now, you've been going by 155 this whole season.  Was that kind of, were you setting any time goals for this whole year?  I didn't really set up time.  We'll start now.  It's going to be that fast.  I'll do anything.  You're out on your world.  She can't be deaf because she's hearing the guy talk.  Well, she might be just.  I mean, she sounds like partially deaf.  I don't think so.  Maybe she still has a lot of water in her.  Dude.  I swear to you, I'm like. 
[00:24:30]  She sounds fucking like there's a problem, but.  My mouth was wide open.  I'm like, what the fuck is this about?  Dude, what the fuck is this?  She sounds like Rosie O'Donnell in the bus movie.  Yeah.  Oh, here it is.  Another one.  All right.  Let's hear it.  That way.  Thinking about my stroke.  Try to keep it long.  Keep on the legs.  Allison, you look so good out there.  This is Mel.  I want to ask you one question.  How many dolphin kicks do you want to take off of each wall?  What is Bob telling you to do?  Uh-oh.  I mean, as many as I can right now. 
[00:25:00]  We're still working hard in the weight room trying to get off that wall fast and strong.  So, I mean, there's not a set number, but.  Now, if you didn't know any better, would you think maybe Special Olympics?  I would think this is Special Olympics, especially with that dumb big headset she's wearing.  Well, her face is.  They gave her a stupid headset.  She has a big, toothy smile.  Oh, look at her shoulders.  Like, right where her boobs start after her arms.  Look at the muscles on there.  Yeah.  From doing that swimming.  That's guy arms.  God damn. 
[00:25:30]  She's a man.  Yeah.  Yeah, but she's America's sweetheart, so.  Does America really love her?  Oh, yeah.  America loves any of our Olympians.  It's an observation is all.  Yeah.  Push play again.  This isn't the one from last night, by the way.  Good with you in there.  It looked like your tempo was consistent all the way through.  Did you feel nice and clean on the last 25 yards?  I mean, it felt pretty smooth through it, so that's a good time.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Thank you, Allison. 
[00:26:00]  Where's she from?  I don't know.  I don't know much about her.  She certainly sounds a little off, but she isn't.  It was the first time I saw her talk last night.  I was a bit shocked.  It sounds that way.  The town she's from?  Yeah.  She's from Dodo Birdsville.  And then Michael Phelps, I guess, has won more, what, medals than anyone else at this  point?  You know what, though?  He's given up on the gold, hasn't he?  Well, he doesn't give a shit about gold.  He's just like, ah, whatever medals I can get.  He fucking blew it in the, well, what was it? 
[00:26:30]  The butterfly, which is supposedly his race, kind of coasted at the end, you didn't see  the clip.  The end is like where you gotta fucking pour it on.  And he got out-touched.  He went for that, kind of like that, kind of just cruise under the water to tap the wall.  And the other guy, I don't even know, because he's from another country, who cares?  He did it like one last extra sort of stroke and out-touched him.  So then Phelps had to get the silver on that one.  And then won a gold later in the night, and now he's the guy that has the most Olympic 
[00:27:00]  medals ever.  Gold, silver, what's the other one?  Bronze.  Bronze, right.  He would have got the gold?  Yeah, he's the most in history.  Like him?  Never.  Most in history ever?  That was the big deal last night.  That was the big deal that Bob Costas was teasing all night, making believe that no one  knew it already happened.  They're stupid with their coverage.  I don't know what they're supposed to do, but...  In this day and age, come on.  In this day and age, it's impossible to keep the info away from people.  What else could they do than just play it off like, eh, if you didn't see it, eh. 
[00:27:30]  They got it.  I don't know.  There it is.  But it's kind of dumb to tease it and hint that, you know...  Yeah, the tease is stupid.  It's ridiculous.  People have seen it.  If you care about the Olympics, you're watching online as it's going on, you're following the  Twitter feeds, you're, uh...  No, you're not waiting all day.  How do you walk through your life without knowing?  Without some asshole blurting it out?  It's impossible.  It's impossible to keep movie spoilers...  No one tells me what happens. 
[00:28:00]  Away from people, all that shit.  I'm not going to watch it.  I'm not going to watch it.  The world's changing, man.  You can't, you can't, you know...  Unless the police come over and tell me about it when the neighbors call.  Oh, boy.  The neighbors call.  Well, you hear it over the radio while they're fucking scolding you for doing Steve Buscemi impressions.  At 12.30?  Yeah, but no, I was doing Fargo.  I was going right into Boardwalk Empire.  I don't know what the problem is, but it starts to your life.  I didn't tell them about the Steve Buscemi impressions.  To me, it's normal, right?  For a Tuesday?  Yeah.  I think so, too.  At least Anne has a good reason. 
[00:28:30]  He's like, but why don't they just understand having fun?  They should understand fun.  I think the neighbor was way out of line.  Fuck the neighbor.  That's right.  I'm just...  And it wasn't even that bad.  Come on, now.  It wasn't even that bad.  It was bad for Tuesday is what I think she was trying to tell you.  No, it wasn't.  She might have accepted it on a Friday.  I was actually consciously being cordial.  I was turning the music down.  Occasionally, a little outburst of, you know, some loud jocularity. 
[00:29:00]  But for the most part, it was just, you know, a night.  I don't get it.  She's jealous.  They're jealous.  Stop it.  That's true.  They're not having fun.  She's a miserable bitch.  Put down that fucking money!  I want my daughter!  Did you see the badminton clip?  Intentional netting of the shuttlecock.  Call it a shuttlecock.  I thought you were going to say no. 
[00:29:30]  It was a good mitten.  Fucking A.  Jesus.  In the badminton thing.  Can you find the badminton clip?  Olympic badminton players face charges over lackluster matches.  They're throwing matches because they don't want to deal with the Chinese.  Apparently, the Chinese are very good at this.  The Chinese have a super team.  No one wants to fucking play them.  So they're throwing matches.  So I think they're in another bracket, which gives them a chance at at least a silver.  They lose in the prelims, right? 
[00:30:00]  But they're still in.  Something.  And then it gets them down a notch, and they get to play some shittier team than the Chinese.  I would know more if it wasn't badminton.  But basically, they chose not to play the game.  So they were just intentionally, slowly just bloop.  Right.  Just throwing the shuttlecock.  Just blooping it.  Blooping it.  The shuttlecock.  Blooping it.  Into the net.  Make sure you check out the video sometime today.  It is pretty weird.  A net.  Cigarette.  The shuttlecock.  The shuttlecock.  These people train their whole lives, and now they're in the big Olympics. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  They don't want to play the Chinese.  And they're throwing games.  Yeah, that doesn't seem like the spirit of the games.  That's the only Batman clip I'll ever watch.  And the official was actually getting in there and saying, hey, you can't do that.  And since there's no real technical thing they could hold them on, they didn't care.  Oh, boy.  That's not even English, is it?  Is it, Sam?  Is it?  Oh, my God.  Breaking news, and then it's a lot of pubic hair. 
[00:31:00]  Pubic hair writing.  Pubic hair writing.  Pubic hair writing scares the shit out of me.  Oh, it's crazy.  You know some shit's going down if you see pubic hair writing.  Yeah.  But apparently there's nothing they can do about it.  Obviously.  But they could tell you, look, hey, you know, step it up a notch.  This is stupid.  But they didn't.  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  The only excitement in badminton.  Is it badminton or badminton?  There's an N in there. 
[00:31:30]  It's one of those, well, not technically.  Badminton.  Well, it depends on who auditions.  What fucking teams, what country.  Auditions.  I don't pronounce the N.  Badminton.  Badminton.  What's that?  Oh, Entenmann's.  That's the other one with the N.  Entenmann's.  Entenmann's.  Entenmann's.  Badminton.  Let's get some Entenmann's.  Entenmann's.  Can we get some Entenmann's?  Here we go again.  Entenmann's.  But we can't find what I want, so fuck Entenmann's.  Why would they take that out of the store? 
[00:32:00]  Now I'm obsessed with Entenmann's again.  What, the chocolate donut?  No, it's the fucking original coffee cake.  That's all I ever want.  They have it in the vending machine.  In 2000.  What the fuck?  Vending machines stink.  They used to.  It's about time someone says it.  Vending machines stink.  I'm not getting the freshest.  Every once in a while you can get a good, like, candy bar.  But in general, their shit stinks in vending machines.  It's horrible.  Over-processed.  And it just doesn't taste fresh.  Or a soda.  You can get a soda and maybe some water.  Canned soda. 
[00:32:30]  Not those old ones where the cup used to go, and it would just piss in the cup.  Seltzer and fucking, and syrup.  It did that?  Yeah, back in the old days, Sam.  Child of the 80s, baby.  In the 80s?  Child of the 80s.  A soda would come out like that.  A cup would drop down and go, chunk.  They used to serve coffee like that, too, in vending machines.  They still do, don't they?  A cup would come down.  Yeah, you could find a coffee machine like that.  No way, like that, where the cup would come down?  Every once in a while you can.  That's crazy. 
[00:33:00]  You certainly can.  I don't think so.  Sam, we're stalling here.  Are they Japanese?  Because their hair looked like American hair on Japanese people, which looks really silly.  Oh, we were talking about that yesterday.  People appreciated that tweet.  They get perms, they color their hair.  Well, the difference between the Chinese and the Japanese, the Japanese people do shit  with their hair, period.  I get the Kajagoogoo hair spike.  Like the Beatles and a lot of 80s bands.  A lot of 80s bands.  And a lot of color in that hair.  I get the tears for fear.  I get it. 
[00:33:30]  It looks great.  It looks great.  There's three cats.  I get three cats struts.  And the hair look good.  No, it looks kind of silly.  Can you Google image Japanese hair?  Let's do this.  Japanese hair.  Let's have fun with this.  Let's look because they love it.  Let's get real stirred up to the Golan races today.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm turning Japanese.  Oh, wow, yeah.  Let me see something.  This is the vapors. 
[00:34:00]  I get a frack of a cigar.  Hair do.  Look good.  Duran, Duran.  Duran, Duran.  Duran, Duran.  Duran, Duran.  Duran, Duran.  Hungry like the wood.  The spit.  I spit.  See?  The Japanese know what to do with their fucking hair.  The Chinese still don't.  My girlfriend, good Pat Benatar. 
[00:34:30]  Look good.  Now, the Pat Benatar, I think, is the one, the Chinese.  All right.  All right.  The Chinese do the Pat Benatar.  Yes.  The Pat Benatar, if you're a woman.  The Beatles, if you're a man.  Wow.  See, that's Japanese right there.  It is Zig Zig.  The Motley Crue.  Hey, Motley Crue.  They're much more in tune with Western culture.  Yeah, they are.  They know what to do with their hair.  I'm telling you.  Yeah.  Look at this shit.  They love that spiky hair. 
[00:35:00]  They love it.  I haven't heard this song in years.  I really think so.  What was this about?  Why would you turn to Japanese?  I think it was about jerking off, right?  It was about jerking off.  And when you come, your eyes kind of squint.  You're like, oh.  And you make Japanese eyes.  But no one really knew that.  No one, no weapon.  Not the time.  Oh, there's a Japanese fella.  Oh, that's Troy Kwan.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I get a Troy Kwan hair. 
[00:35:30]  Make you believe he's not 42 years old.  Troy Kwan.  I get on with a skateboard.  Long board.  I get on a long board.  It must sell because I move.  Now go Chinese.  I really think so.  Men's Chinese hair.  All Pete Rosenmo.  Thank you, Keeney.  All right.  I'm Japanese.  I really think.  No, it's very tamed down. 
[00:36:00]  Come on now.  No, but they don't have a little body to it, but he's trying.  But the point is, they don't have a lot of Google images for men's haircuts for Chinese guys.  No.  They try.  Not like the Japanese, man.  The Japanese are ahead in that category.  What?  Did you turn this up in the car when you were driving back in the day?  Yeah.  Fuck yeah.  It was pretty cool.  Being a child of the 80s, you had to.  Of the 80s.  I really meant that.  You know, speaking of the 80s, it was on this date back in 1981 that MTV started. 
[00:36:30]  Oh.  So does that mean that we had Nina Blackwood in here a year ago already?  Wow.  Is that a year?  Like that?  Remember when she came in?  I remember.  It was an anniversary.  They had all the VJs doing all their press for the 30th anniversary?  It was 2011, and yes, since it was 81.  Now it's 31 years ago.  MTV started with, of course, Video Killed the Radio Star.  What?  I never heard that bit of trivia before. 
[00:37:00]  The first video ever played on All Right.  Turning Japanese came out in 1980.  There you go.  Child of the 80s.  You were driving around?  No, I wasn't driving.  I wasn't driving in 1980.  You both just said you were driving around and turning it up.  Well, yeah.  Get your license to like 16.  Fucking older sister.  What happened?  My older sister would drive me to the Walt Whitman Mall, and we would crank out the tunes.  Ah.  I remember the buckles.  Although she was more into the AM fucking radio.  Oh, wow.  What was the second song? 
[00:37:30]  Video Killed the Radio Star.  What was the second song?  Did we do this bit?  No one knows.  I have no idea.  No, we did this bit.  The second video MTV ever played?  That's the trivia.  Well, how about the first ten songs?  That would be a good little thing.  That would kill two minutes today.  Yeah, come on.  Get the first ten song set list from 1981 MTV.  I'm going to guess David Bowie now. 
[00:38:00]  I'm going to guess.  Let's do it.  I'm going to guess.  There's the buggles.  Hold on.  We don't want the answers.  What?  It's going to be hard to guess.  I'm going to guess Burning For You by Blue Oyster Cult.  I would guess that, too.  That's number two?  No.  Well, in the top ten, I'm going to guess.  Oh, oh.  I'm going to guess.  Maybe Pat Benatar.  I'm guessing Pat Benatar.  For number two?  Yeah, because I'm guessing she was like a biggie.  Can we reveal number two?  I'm going to guess Gone, Gone, Gone.  She'd be gone so long. 
[00:38:30]  Gone, Gone, Gone.  She'd be gone so long.  Gone, Gone, Gone.  The Chilliwax.  I'm going to put the Chilliwax on.  I get the hair like a Chilliwax.  The correct answer is.  Number two is.  Pat Benatar.  You better run.  You better run.  You better hide.  You better leave.  Wow, that sucks.  She's number two because no one knows that.  No one remembers that.  All right, number three.  31 years ago today.  Rod Stewart.  That's going to say Rod Stewart.  Which one?  She Won't Dance.  Which song is that?  Give us She Won't Dance.  Why wouldn't they do it? 
[00:39:00]  If you want my body, then you think I'm sexy.  Come on, sugar, let me know.  I'm going to butt.  I had that on a 45.  I thought it was really good.  Yeah?  I loved that song as a kid.  It was a guilty pleasure.  Yeah.  They call those guilty pleasures.  For me, I thought that was cool stuff, though.  You know what a guilty pleasure was for Rod?  A stomach full of cum that he needed pumped out.  No, that guilty pleasure was kissing a girl.  Oh, yeah.  She Won't Dance.  I don't know if we know this one, do we?  It's not available on YouTube.  And Sex Man says...  I don't see it in here. 
[00:39:30]  It's not in the system.  What the fuck's wrong with Rod Stewart?  It's the third song ever played on MTV, and he doesn't want it out there.  It should have been one of his big hits.  How is it not in the big computer, E-Rock?  E-Rock.  This is satellite radio, for Christ's sake.  He had a huge hit there.  He had that fucking...  What was that big hit he had back then?  She Won't Dance.  The other one.  Run Train Thing.  Downtown Train Thing.  That thing.  The other one.  What other one?  Rhythm of My Heart. 
[00:40:00]  No.  Oh, God.  No, that was...  What's that song he had about the fucking girl?  Oh, Maggie Mae.  Wake up, Maggie.  I think I got something to say to you.  I could sing that one, I think.  I hear like a Rod Stewart.  It's very spiky on the top.  A cropper cut.  What are you doing, Sam?  Looking for the video for She Won't Dance?  We don't care anymore.  We've moved on.  It's fair.  Let's go.  I want to know the top ten.  Get the hair to go.  Red Rocker.  Sammy Hagar. 
[00:40:30]  Number four.  Number four would be...  Oh, I was going to guess that one.  Oh, man.  No, I would never have guessed that.  I would have guessed another song.  You better, you better, you better.  You better bet your life.  How many things are you going to bet?  I will cut you like a knife.  They're more terrible than with Snuff.  The Who loves repeating words.  You don't like talking about my generation.  You better, you better make a bet.  I bet, you better, you better bet. 
[00:41:00]  We heard you.  You better, you better, you better make a bet.  Betty and Betty Colby said, you better bet.  Right?  It's just you better, you better, you bet.  Why do they have to make a bet?  You better go to bed.  Betty said bet.  Bet.  We're right.  I like Jimmy's take on...  Who, who, who, who?  That's how I sing it now.  I know.  I can't listen to that song now without thinking to Jimmy.  Well, the Who, I'll say it again.  The Who loved repeating words in their songs.  Yeah.  A lot.  You better, you better, you better, you better, you better bet, bet. 
[00:41:30]  This is when everything just had this sound.  And it was just like every solo Pete Townsend song.  This brings me back, though.  I like this song.  I used to love The Who.  I like this one.  I don't know why.  It was played a shitload.  Who didn't own Who's Next?  Come on.  I never owned it.  Stop it, people.  Shut up.  Behind blue eyes, baby.  It was great.  Who's Next?  You related to the lyrics?  That makes me laugh.  Listen to the words, man.  I'm heating up again.  Stop.  No, I think you and I.  I actually like that song.  Everyone has their, their, listen to the words, man. 
[00:42:00]  They're talking about me.  Or that's how I feel, man.  Man.  That is one of mine.  Why did you, how did you think that fit you?  No one knows what it's like to be the what?  The bad man.  The bad man.  See, I'm a bad man.  But I'm also a sad man.  No one knows what it is.  I like to be the bad man.  Boom, boom, boom.  I know what it's like to be the bad man.  No.  The bad man.  Behind the lies.  It's just a song that talks to me, man. 
[00:42:30]  Behind the, behind the eye, nose mole.  When I was going through my growing up years, you know.  People didn't understand what I was about.  Would you, would you fantasize about singing this on stage in front of a crowd explaining  yourself?  Oh, no.  Didn't have a period of explanation.  No, no, no.  But you would like pretend that you were singing and they were all just kind of getting  you?  Yeah.  Finally getting me.  Yes.  This is a good goddamn song, man.  It's a great song.  Shit, yeah.  What song talked to you where you're like, man, this, this, this is me, man. 
[00:43:00]  I have so many.  Give me one.  Mine's fucking behind blue eyes at the time, anyway.  Boom.  You got one?  Boom, boom, boom.  I have to think.  I'm sure there's 50.  And Whistle's little fucking baseless.  You got one in?  What?  Oh, no.  That means exploring your emotions.  Sorry.  I didn't mean to ask you that question.  That's crazy.  Oh, right.  I might throw it out there.  What?  Do you have a song that kind of, you felt like it speaks to me?  It was talking about you.  Yes.  It was the house next door to me.  The house next door to me was.  Yeah, well.  Come on.  Everyone's got one. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, man.  You don't have one.  I can't think of it off the top of my head, but I did.  I think I have others, too.  I'm going to start thinking.  I did back in the day.  Back in what they called the day.  Oh, wait a minute.  You know, child of the 80s.  Probably some song that might have been, hold on, from the 70s.  I mean, every day.  I have another one, and I don't know if I've ever brought this up in here.  Oh, shit.  I'm not really sure.  It's time now.  You should.  I don't know.  I am here like a kipper winger.  Thank you.  If this goes bad, I'll be honest with you.  I'm going to attack Iraq. 
[00:44:00]  Okay, great.  Is that fair?  All right.  It's always a fair game.  Is that fair?  Win-win.  I'm going to use him as a punching bag if this goes badly.  It's horrific.  Punching bag.  I can't do this one.  Why?  I don't know.  Maybe we should take a break.  Nah.  It could be an hour.  Come on.  Nah, I can't do it.  Nah, you got it.  What song are you saying?  I even wrote down the lyrics.  Ooh, that's doochie.  I wrote them down and they were hanging up in my dorm room and my roommate ripped them 
[00:44:30]  down.  Well, is he humming the lyrics in a college dorm?  Yeah.  I'm 18, though.  Fuck it.  I was 18 and very immature.  I wasn't ready for college.  So if a girl came back to your room, you would explain to her?  No, it was about a girl.  Read the world.  Oh, no, no.  It was a song that talked to me and it's what I was feeling with this relationship.  I can't do this.  Oh, what a lonely boy.  Oh, what a lonely boy.  No, I was actually feeling that maybe love thing for the first time.  Was the girl feeling the same way? 
[00:45:00]  Oh, yeah.  At the time.  I was hoping no.  So you wrote the lyrics down about her and put them on the wall?  Oh, my roommate who just ripped them down.  Was it, girl?  Look what she's done to me.  It's a New Wave song.  It's a New Wave genre.  People are guessing.  Peter Cetera, Gloria Love.  Wow, no.  She blinded me with science?  It's more in that genre of New Wave.  Yeah.  Not the Karate Kid 2 song from Chicago.  Oh, boy. 
[00:45:30]  Ooh.  What's on the top ten list on MTV?  It doesn't matter.  Oh, that song.  I'll be a man.  You will fight for your honor.  Is that it?  No.  I can't do this, man.  I actually stopped breathing.  What is it?  Open arms.  That's a good song.  Open arms.  This is.  It's up there.  Open arms.  Open arms is up there when you're feeling that love for the first time.  No?  Nope.  Is it Africa by Toto?  It's more New Wave. 
[00:46:00]  Open arms is journey.  I don't know who's New Wave, though.  What's New Wave considered?  New Wave pop.  New Wave is like, think early 80s.  I would walk 5,000 miles.  New Wave is any singer that sounds like this.  A new wave pop.  And then your stupid keyboard's got to move around a lot.  Yes.  Keyboards.  He plays the synthesizer.  What's on the top ten list?  We can move on.  It doesn't matter.  Hold on.  Wait, was it not?  It's brutal.  It's not?  I might want to save this when there's more guys in. 
[00:46:30]  Fishman's got it.  So my beating is really good.  Fishman's got it.  What?  Come on and rock me.  I'm a deus.  I'm a deus.  I'm a deus.  I'm a deus.  I'm a deus.  Wait, what was the fucking one?  God.  Not Thomas.  Just not.  Wait, what did you just say there?  That's Thomas Dolby.  Thomas Dolby.  No.  No?  It couldn't have been Thomas Dolby.  That's the Thompson Twins.  What?  The Thompson Twins.  Oh, no.  What?  Oh, no.  Is it?  Hold me now.  Wow.  No, it couldn't be. 
[00:47:00]  Hold me now.  I'm going to turn B red today.  And I rarely do this.  It was.  It was.  Yeah.  It was hold me now.  Thompson.  Dude, how did you get that?  How did you figure that out?  Because his reaction when I said Tom, and I'm like, what else was Tom?  So I just went to Thompson Twins.  Then Tom hates.  This song.  This is what I thought.  This song.  No, I don't know.  It was Tom.  This song.  Tom hates him.  You wrote these lyrics out?  This song.  This?  I'm so embarrassed.  Why?  You wrote the words out? 
[00:47:30]  Ew.  He wrote hold me now.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Bring them up, Sam.  Hold on.  Pause this for me.  I have a picture.  Before I bite you in a fat neck.  Sorry.  I could be taking a plaid.  I was going to bite you.  Oh, my God.  This spoke to me.  My first, like, real relationship when I was, like, 18 in college.  I have a picture.  I have a picture.  Oh, my God.  Pin to my wall.  Pin to my wall.  I got to shut down my Twitter.  I'm going to the country club and caddying.  I hope he doesn't lose his ball. 
[00:48:00]  Yes.  I have a hole.  I'll drill in the wall.  On my chin is a pair of balls.  We're pouring cement in our backyard.  We're ditching our car and taking Fresca because he's dead.  Poor Fresca.  Oh, poor Fresca.  Oh.  Road sodas now.  Road sodas now. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, my God.  Help me.  Oh, it's the douchiest thing.  Hold on.  I'm sorry.  I'll pause this for a second.  The doors wouldn't shut, so we strung a cable that would have cut us in half.  Oh, stare at me while I sleep.  Oh, the Negro stared at me while I sleep.  Oh, wow.  Very good.  Good call back.  The day I was supposed to be raped in Buffalo.  Yes.  Wow.  That is a true story, man. 
[00:49:00]  That is an image.  I was supposed to be raped in Buffalo.  People don't understand that, do they?  Wow.  Well, I have a picture pinned to my wall.  I want to know which one.  An image of you and me.  Mm-hmm.  And we're laughing and loving it all.  So you kind of had an image of you two just frolicing.  Well, I probably, because this is a long time ago now, probably actually had those pictures, yes.  Oh.  Oh.  Look at our life now.  Tattered and torn.  Ooh.  See, that didn't make sense.  Why?  Sure, it didn't.  Because you were both tortured souls. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, I know why.  I know why.  You probably smelled it with one T in the middle because you were young.  All right.  Does it look like tatered?  Does it look like Ron White's act?  Tatered and torn.  Tatered and torn.  Oh, no.  He rocked his pacing back and forth.  I'm ready to go, E.  Oh, Jesus.  Get ready for a couple punches.  We fuss and we fight.  Wait, the tatered and torn, I will break this down for you.  It was a long-distance relationship, so there's the tatered and torn.  I'm a kid, and I'm like, how the fuck am I going to make this work?  That's tatered and torn. 
[00:50:00]  You live there.  You're right.  I live over here.  You're right.  And you live over there.  I'm over here now, tatered and torn, y'all.  So that was the tatered and torn, and that's what spoke to me, like, ah, fuck, how are we  going to make this work, man?  Oh, wow.  I don't even have a job.  But we fuss and fight.  And I got to get back to Long Island and do some of that caddying.  Yeah, come on.  We fuss and fight and delight in the tears that we cry until dawn.  Oh, there you go.  You hung this up.  Transcribed it.  Look, I didn't want to do this.  I know.  I've been here before. 
[00:50:30]  Whenever you've got to go, look.  I didn't want to do this.  Oh, no.  I was going to hold back this information.  Yes, I did hang this up.  Fortunately, you didn't.  Hold me now.  Hold me now.  Warm my heart.  Because you had kind of a cold heart.  No one understood you.  A girl could warm your heart.  Yeah, this one could.  We could all understand that, right?  This girl could.  Right, guys?  We could understand that part.  We're all in the same boat here, right?  Right.  Stay with me.  Let loving start.  Yeah, see?  Aw.  Nice, right?  Let loving start.  But would she really say you were a dreamer? 
[00:51:00]  Say you were a dreamer.  You would say something and she'd say, oh, but you're a dreamer.  I had dreams of doing radio back then, yeah.  With two of a kind.  I was dreaming for something better for myself.  So she was a dreamer, too, because you're two of a kind.  Yep.  You were dreaming about doing radio and she was dreaming about somebody who didn't hang  lyrics in a college dormant.  We were going to do this together, man.  Both of us searching for some perfect world we know we'll never find.  Wow. 
[00:51:30]  That's like a premonition of Sirius XM satellite radio.  Perfect world we know we'll never find because it's just there.  I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.  Where's that dick?  Oh.  So perhaps...  You can't do that bit!  We're going to Chicago, but you can't do anything.  Oh, shit!  I'm shutting down my Twitter for 12 hours so these people can't get to me.  Sorry.  Keep up your good nature. 
[00:52:00]  12 hours.  I'm going dark.  So perhaps I should leave here.  Yeah, yeah!  Go far away.  Go far away.  He left Long Island and went to...  College.  College.  That's right.  That's how you get your dreams done.  You've got to move away from Rome.  Don't these people understand this by now?  They should.  Nothing happens in your hometown.  Wake the fuck up.  Get out of there.  Leave.  But you know that there's nowhere that I'd rather be than with you here today.  Did she know you fucking felt this way? 
[00:52:30]  That's kind of true, actually.  Did you know she...  Did she know that you felt this way?  Oh, yeah.  And you told her about this song and said,  Baby, this song is about us, man.  It's our song.  And like she'd be talking while it was on and you'd go,  Psh!  Psh!  This part!  This grattled.  I stopped breathing again.  So wait.  Now would you rewrite...  I've got to remind myself to breathe.  What?  Would you write, Hold Me Now, Warm My Heart, Stay With Me, Let Loving Start?  Would you actually put the parentheses that says, Let Loving Start? 
[00:53:00]  Let Loving Start.  I wrote it as is, man.  Oh, yeah.  You ask if I love you.  Well, what can I say?  What can you say?  You know that I do and that this is just one of those games that we play.  So you two would probably quarrel.  No, it's very literal.  They played Monopoly.  It's just one of the games that they play.  They played Doctor because she was six and he was 18.  Oh, kick your legs now. 
[00:53:30]  Why is he wrong picking his nose?  Oh, here.  Don't pick your nose in there.  It's disgusting.  He probably had some food from last night.  Oh, no.  It's coming out his trunk.  Are we done?  So I'll sing you a new song.  Are we done?  Oh, no.  Please don't cry anymore.  Oh, you're fucking helping her out.  Don't cry.  And then I'll ask your forgiveness.  Yeah.  Though I don't know just what I'm asking it for.  Yeah.  So that when you two would fight, you'd be asking for her to, hey, let's straighten this out.  You don't know.  You just want to get it better.  You just want to get to that better place. 
[00:54:00]  You wanted the hurting to stop.  Right.  Right.  Let's move on.  Well, you want to let loving start.  Let's move on.  You want to let loving start.  No, I mean, let's move on.  Let loving start.  Right.  Emotion.  Oh, oh, hold me now.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  I'm sorry.  Can we hear the song?  Wait, are you done with the lyrics?  There's no more, yeah.  Oh, good.  You ought to know.  You wrote them out.  They're beautiful.  It's a short, beautiful poem.  There it is.  I was as lame as they call them when I was 18.  I would think you were lame if you just enjoyed this once on the radio. 
[00:54:30]  If you said I heard this once and didn't turn it off, I'd be like, what a douche.  I was extremely innocent before life fucking beat the shit out of me.  I'm not innocent anymore, motherfuckers.  Is that believable?  This second verse.  This is your verse.  Yeah, that describes that dreamer.  We know we'll never find.  So perhaps I should leave here.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, go far away. 
[00:55:00]  It's Geneseo.  But you know that there's no way to do.  I'd rather be than with you here today.  Oh, oh, oh.  Someone to the hole in a wall.  Hold me now.  Hole in wall.  Oh, hole in wall.  There's a cock singing to him.  Hold me now.  Why am I the only one?  Where's your song, motherfuckers?  I talk about my song.  I confess going to a tranny bar and losing my wallet. 
[00:55:30]  This is fair game.  There it is.  I have the gayest.  Alone without irony.  The gayest Chicago song was mine because some girl that.  Would you like the side note to the story before we move on to yours?  Yes.  Oh, no.  We don't have to move on to mine.  The side note to this is she was the one with the hairy back.  No.  That's who I lost my picture.  Stinky pussy.  Stinky twat.  Yes.  Oh, no.  Hold my hand out the window.  Hold my nose. 
[00:56:00]  And the story goes for the newer listeners.  I was driving back to Long Island on one of the breaks, probably Thanksgiving, I would assume,  somewhere around there.  And I finger popped her the night before.  It was a fantastic Geneseo drink special the night before.  And there was some finger popping going on.  Wow.  And it smelled so bad.  I swear to you, my hand was out the window for most of the ride.  Wow.  And I went left-handed for some reason.  Ah, Southpaw.  Yeah, because I remember distinctly having. 
[00:56:30]  Switch to Southpaw Rock.  He's ready.  Believe me.  Having my fucking hand out the window.  I know why you did it.  It was horrendous.  And I scrubbed and scrubbed.  And this is when I was really young.  I didn't understand that this shit could go on.  And it was actually.  Yeah.  I thought all women pretty much smelled like this.  You were playing with a pussy.  And you were probably, with the other hand, quickly looking for the cassette deck to pop this in.  That's why you were going lefty.  And then you learned years later that some girls have that thing.  What is it called?  Vaginas. 
[00:57:00]  No.  Yeah.  Why don't I have to make it real instead of laughing at the joke.  A scratch and sniff picture of you on the wall.  Hold my nose.  Hold my nose.  That was her flaw, man.  It was brutal.  Yeah, that's a rough flaw.  It was fucking brutal.  A milky badger sparse.  The rest of her was terrific.  Why did it end?  Well, because I was growing up there, Sam.  Yeah? 
[00:57:30]  I was just a kid when I went to college.  And I became a very different person by the end of this.  Did you leave her?  And she was still extremely innocent.  And she moved back to her little, I don't even want to say where she's from, a little town in upstate New York.  Ooh.  And a little town called Stinky Cunt New York.  I just stole her the K.  And at this point, she's probably been married, I don't know.  Oh, God.  Eight times.  Once they fucked and they divorced her.  A guy that had his olfactory taken out.  Exactly.  She works at the fucking, at the sinus removal center. 
[00:58:00]  So she can meet guys.  There were men that had their noses removed.  She's like, I'd love to go out and have coffee with you.  She loves guys that were attacked by chimpanzees.  She was a trooper, though.  She kept people on bath salts.  She followed me for a little while, but I was like, it's just not going to happen anymore.  When I moved to Rochester, all of a sudden she showed up in Rochester.  I was like, hey, I got to get a job here.  It was weird.  It started getting a little weird.  She was really cool, though.  The seagulls are circling. 
[00:58:30]  Yes.  We tried to look her up about a year ago.  Yeah.  This one's a very hard one to look up.  The day we were all looking up exes and stuff.  For some reason, I can't look up any of my exes.  They're all, like, fucking underground.  I don't know what that's about.  Mine won't take, I have one ex.  They're all underground, though.  I won't take my Facebook requests or anything.  She must hate me.  Really?  Yeah.  Can you see what she looks like?  I'm curious to see what these...  Yeah, she's a pretty girl.  I want to see what these exes look like nowadays.  Right. 
[00:59:00]  And just what their lives became.  You're right.  My one ex is totally underground.  Totally.  I got underground exes because I found, I always found the weird ones.  She doesn't want to show her Facebook pictures with a lot of sarcoma on her face.  You know, you gave her eights.  We got it.  We got it.  That's right.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Leather and Lace.  That's a nice one, too.  Give to me your leather.  Take from me my lace. 
[00:59:30]  You know what?  It kind of did have a...  Oh, you got one.  That song, as a matter of fact, with that Lisa chick that...  Leather and Lace?  Yeah, yeah, because our father...  Remember our father was...  Jimmy's making a weird look.  My fine-feathered friend.  Yeah, I remember that guy.  Listen, my fine-feathered friend.  You were into that girl, right?  Yeah, Lisa.  And you would visit her at college and the father...  The father got mad that I was visiting her at college because I was laying the fucking  pipe to her.  Basically, you were living in an 80s movie.  Yeah. 
[01:00:00]  You were.  And then the father had to get involved, like, you're not going to see my daughter.  He was the guy from the other side of the tracks.  Yeah, and I was the leather, she was the lace.  See?  Nice.  Get it?  I love it.  They just have to go up to Quinnipiac College.  You know, I graduated...  Taking a poll?  Yeah.  Who's the biggest deuce?  I took my poll up.  Can you pause your story?  Yeah.  I don't want to lose this phone call.  It's a quick one.  AJ, quick.  Nebraska, go ahead.  Hey, I finger-popped a girl one night. 
[01:00:30]  She stunk so bad, I had to wash my hands in diesel fuel.  Diesel fuel.  That's bad.  That's pretty fucking bad.  Thank you.  That's all I wanted.  Sorry, Ed.  No, this guy's cool.  I used to have to drive up to Quinnipiac College to see her.  Yeah.  And, yeah, I graduated from the School of Hard Knocks, and she was an honors student at  Smithtown High School before she went to Quinnipiac.  And we spent the summer in between her graduating high school and her first year of college. 
[01:01:00]  So it was that summer, and then, you know, she had to leave in September, so it was very,  you know, very emotional.  Those summer romances.  You know, because, you know, it's just over.  And it was.  We tried to.  They never worked.  We tried to continue it.  It didn't work.  I just want to get into the summer romance thing, because this is something that a lot  of people can relate to.  You do the summer romance where it's perfect.  It's perfect, right?  Summer loving. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  And then you make it into maybe mid-September, and then the wheels always fall off.  You know what she told me?  She told me, if you're going to come up from now on, could you please call first?  Oh, that's the girl?  Yeah.  Could you please call first?  Because I thought, like, a surprise with, like, flowers, and I was like, hey, baby, I'm  here.  Oh, my God, I wasn't expecting you.  And then she was like, yeah, could you call before you show up?  Because I'm probably going to be sucking some Negro's cock in the dorm. 
[01:02:00]  You want to hear another lame story?  I had a summer romance.  It was the ultimate summer romance.  Where's summer loving, you fucking pig?  You got a stinger in his nose?  Your song, by the way, should have been called Leather and Cheerio, because you're an asshole.  I had the ultimate summer romance.  Sorry, you're on.  And then, it was amazing.  And they're like, you know, the whole, we'll keep in touch, blah, blah, blah, here's my 
[01:02:30]  phone number, we'll write, blah, blah, blah, blah.  She went to, I'll say it, fuck it, Boston College.  Uh-huh.  And then, it's early.  I think a few people went there.  Exactly, yeah.  No, she was from fucking, I don't care, North America.  It's my circle that'll know, that's what I'm saying.  The people still don't know, I don't know shit.  So, she's at Boston College, and I'm like, I gotta keep this fucking romance going.  This was, it was an amazing summer.  Right, right.  So, I start calling her stuff, and I'm like, all right, I want to come up next weekend.  All right, well, how about, you know, the two weekends, right? 
[01:03:00]  A lot of little weird excuses, but not the classic, no, it's over.  Well, did you think that she didn't like you when you showed off splashing around?  Under the tax.  So, then my friend Buzzy, at the time, was living in Boston.  So, I'm like, I got it.  I'm going to go to Boston to see Buzzy.  Now, I'm close.  Now, you can go see her.  Now, I'm close, instead of doing the creepy ride from Long Island.  Yes.  So, now I call her.  I'm like, hey, good news, I'm in Boston.  I'm like, you know, can I stop by? 
[01:03:30]  We'll have lunch, spend the day together, you know.  Long story short, I wasn't taking this weird, vague no for an answer.  So, she goes, all right, come on by.  So, I come by Boston College.  She didn't want you to come by.  How about this?  She meets me in the fucking lounge area, the dorm.  She wouldn't even let me go in her room.  Are you kidding me?  What the fuck is that?  It was a polite little, oh, it's good to see you, blah, blah, blah.  I'm like, well, you want to go, you know, get a drink or lunch?  Eh, well, I got this thing. 
[01:04:00]  She's wiping Afro-Sheen off her pillow.  Did a friend come down and tell you that she was killed in a kiln accident?  But I'm in a lounge in Boston.  I felt like the biggest douchebag, because now at this point, obviously, I'm not that stupid.  I realize, holy fuck, this is over.  How long are you talking about Leibovitz?  This goes back a long time, too.  I would say maybe a half hour.  Did you make out of there?  No, nothing.  Nothing.  But now I'm standing there going, oh, my God, this is over. 
[01:04:30]  Holy fuck, and this is how I have to find out.  Yeah, that's good.  And I said, all right, well, you know, I'll call you soon or whatever.  I made some excuse and hightailed it out of there and never spoke to her again.  That was it.  That was fucking it.  Oof.  But you never get it.  Are you embarrassed when you were leaving?  I was bored of, I was so, probably the most embarrassed I've ever been when I realized,  hey, stupid, why didn't you figure it out before now?  You should have read the signs you knew, but you didn't want to accept, so you took those 
[01:05:00]  vague, little, weird, almost no's as a possibility it's still happening.  And I never talked to her again.  That was it.  Oh, my God.  And I was in, man.  My summer dreams ripped at the sea.  John Travolta sings this to that guy who was kissing on his airplane steps.  Oh, yeah.  I found out years later that she obviously, you know, found a guy almost immediately when  she went to Boston College.  Oh, man.  And I was out.  Summer romance. 
[01:05:30]  Done.  Done.  Did you ever look her up on Facebook?  Oh, no.  What will they say tomorrow at school?  Sam.  So you turned around, you hugged your body, like, I'll talk to you soon.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  All that shit.  But I could tell with her body language and how she was talking to me.  I know.  Oh, my God.  Body language.  And I just wanted out of it.  John is slamming shut.  I wasn't even mad.  I was just like, oh, my God.  You're the biggest fucking douchebag.  It's humiliating.  It was completely humiliating.  You bitches don't even know what you do.  I'm like, I guess you didn't think the summer romance was as good as I thought it was. 
[01:06:00]  Holy fuck.  I was, like, fast-forwarding on that one.  Jesus.  Hey, this could be something.  You were in Long Island.  Where did you meet her?  In Long Island?  Yeah, Long Island.  So she was a Long Island girl.  Yeah, did a lot of beach shit and stuff.  Fucked her?  Huntington.  No, actually.  Fuck off.  Oh, you never fucked her?  That's what happened.  She went to Boston College.  They made out under the dock.  She was younger.  12 o'clock.  She was younger.  How old were you?  We did a lot, but we didn't do the other.  She was six.  How old were you?  She went away.  She was at the daycare.  She was going into college, so she was 17, 18, and I was, like, 20, 21. 
[01:06:30]  Isn't that 19 going into college?  Unless she's really smart.  18, you're going into college.  Unless she's smart.  So she was 18.  She's smart.  And you were, like, 20?  I was 20 going on 21, I believe, at the time.  Oh.  What were you doing in Long Island, work-wise?  Caddying.  Oh, you're caddying.  She was a rich girl.  Oh, awesome.  Winning that caddy tournament.  She had, like, a way nicer car.  Me at 17.  So when you would try to come and see her, she would always have a reason why you couldn't?  No, it was the one time. 
[01:07:00]  That was it.  That was fucking it.  After getting the excuses on the phone, these vague, ah, yeah, we'll try to work something  out soon.  I'm studying for finals, whatever the fuck.  This goes way back, too, so the details might be a little cloudy, but I remember that it  was a fucking fist to the face.  Sledgehammer, I should say, to the face.  What's that Chicago song about, like, oh, God, the chick fucking...  Sweet home, Chicago.  Unrequited love.  Come on, man.  I don't know that one. 
[01:07:30]  God, I hate it.  It's called Unrequited love?  No, it's just about Unrequited love.  What is it?  I don't know, but I felt terrible every time I heard it because there was a girl that  didn't like me in Dana Hills High School.  You narrowed it down to one girl?  It was a girl who didn't like me.  She represented all women.  It's Eve.  Nice.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was terrible. 
[01:08:00]  Nice.  And the fucked up thing is, I think back, she looked like Ann Romano.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  High school version of Ann Romano.  She had that short fucking red haircut.  Yeah, I know.  Would you walk by all cocky and go, so up on your feet?  So up on your feet.  I rolled up cigarettes in my sleeve.  Tried to fix her plumbing.  I think.  This is it.  I'm even trying to remember what her last name was.  This is a good tune. 
[01:08:30]  This is weird shit today.  This is stuff I haven't thought of in a really fucking long time.  Best shit.  You get it out of your system.  Oh, yeah.  It's all good.  I don't give a fuck.  R-A-M-S-E-Y.  See?  Why this chum in a ramp?  Oh, here it comes.  I hate that part.  Dude, another accent's on the ground.  Let's try to look her up. 
[01:09:00]  Another accent's on the ground.  He shot us.  It's not that it's on the ground.  These broads are so old.  They don't understand social networking, and they're married.  You're not going to find these fucking broads.  I had like five exes up until like five years ago.  Wow.  Now I got fucking 300.  I really went on a tear.  Yeah.  You ramped it up.  I really did.  Eh.  What happened?  I'm trying to think how many relationships I took seriously. 
[01:09:30]  Every one of them was serious.  There's a bunch in between, but actual serious relationships.  What?  I'm probably at around five to believe.  Five, maybe six.  Somewhere around there.  Serious relationships.  Oh, no.  In my life.  And a lot of them were fucking nuts.  The smelly vagina one.  She wasn't nuts, though.  Smelly vagina one.  Strong family background.  She worked hard.  She's got a career.  One in Buffalo who's batshit crazy. 
[01:10:00]  No, it's not that one.  It's hot for me to say.  I'm sorry.  The one in Buffalo's batshit crazy.  She was the one that didn't take the breakup well.  Oh, it's in Bob Kelly's book.  Oh, the cheat.  The cheat.  Yeah.  Yeah, where she decided to have sex on my answer machine with her ex.  Oh, that's hot.  The one she said she wasn't with the whole time I was with her when she was with him as  well.  That was fun.  It was a big hit in like 1975.  Which one now?  I don't know.  Chicago song. 
[01:10:30]  Oh.  It wasn't this one.  I like this one for fuck's sake.  Yeah.  Being a child of the 80s, it was 1975.  Jesus.  You got to start doing these music bits if you want to keep that alive.  All right.  Come on now.  There's a lot of weird things going on.  I went to...  You're a little older than me, but I'm starting to think you might be...  No, I never...  You sure you didn't fucking pad your age over the years?  I never padded it.  All right.  I never padded it.  Because you have...  I went to the same high school as Nicole Brown Simpson.  Wow.  I was a freshman when she was a senior. 
[01:11:00]  She's been dead for 18 years.  I know.  Okay.  Yeah.  You went to the same high school as her?  Yeah, Dana Hills.  Was she hot?  I wish she had...  She was into the black guys back then, too.  Really?  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  Did that bother you?  Is that where this whole thing started?  There were only two black guys in Dana Hills High School.  Yes.  One nobody and one who would decapitate her.  Yeah.  No, it's not bad.  So you knew her?  No, no.  No, I saw her. 
[01:11:30]  She was, like, very popular as a senior.  I didn't know this.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was a freshman.  But I was very...  Oh, I was just...  Look at the ground guy.  I was, you know...  You couldn't compete with the OJs.  I had horrible cystic acne.  So it was very hard to get up to my friends.  What does cystic mean?  Oh, it's just big fucking...  It literally looked like I was beat up every day.  Oh, that sucks.  Like, just big fucking...  Big poons all over my face.  Yeah, I was that guy right there.  I was terrible. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, I knew a guy like that in school.  Oh, thank God for Accutane.  But it was a little...  You know, I was a day late and a dollar short on it, so...  Are you going to know?  No, you did all right after that.  No, it would have been great if I didn't have to wait until, you know...  I got what they call your scarring.  But you know what?  It made me reinforce my personality and made me the wonderful person I am today.  If this is the fucking...  This is the improved personality.  Fuck my neighbors, I'm doing Buscemi. 
[01:12:30]  See, this is what's...  Put down that fucking money!  Blood has been shed, Jerry.  If you leave me now...  What do you mean?  What do you mean?  If You Leave Me Now by Chicago?  If You Leave Me Now.  Yes!  That was it!  If You Leave Me Now, E-Rock!  I've been sitting here...  You'll take away the biggest gut...  Pardon me!  I've been sitting here racking my brain on that one.  I like this one.  This...  I...  I would think of... 
[01:13:00]  I was so in love with this girl.  She had the little short haircut like Ann Romano.  And I would look at her and...  This is a song from somebody you would think that already was in...  You know, you were in love.  You had a relationship.  Don't go.  Please don't go.  This was all beforehand.  I would...  I would hear this song and think of this girl thinking that if we were in a relationship,  I wouldn't want her to leave me.  Oh, my God. 
[01:13:30]  What a douchebag I was.  You don't even have to relate.  I didn't have a...  She didn't know...  That's worse than my Hold Me Now.  Come on.  To this day...  That's worse.  She never even knew who I was.  Oh, I had one of those.  I looked at her like she was fucking it for me.  I used to go home and just think, oh, my God, I want her to be my girlfriend so bad.  And I would hear this song and be like, I was so sad because I was thinking, don't  leave me, but I never had her in the first place.  This is a fucking horrible boom, boom, Washington hairdo. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, I know.  Oh, and then my dad would walk in the room and I'd be all weepy because I was thinking  about her and he'd go like this.  Son of a bitch.  Find another girl and give me words of wisdom.  Jesus Christ, there's plenty of fish in the sea, faggot.  All right, Dad, thank you.  Would you really be curled up on your bed just listening to the song?  This song would make me all weepy because I loved the girl so much and just never...  Why did I talk to her?  What a dick bag. 
[01:14:30]  What a scared little fuckwad.  How old were you?  I need a DeLorean.  19.  How old were you?  I got to go back and fucking...  It was 25 in high school.  Exactly.  You've got Apollo air conditioning.  I would look back a few times.  It was scary to talk to girls.  I was 15.  I was 15.  Those years were brutal.  You were older than I thought, actually.  I already had buzzed fucking buzz cum on my cock.  And I just wanted that girl.  I wanted that girl.  Oh, what was her name?  I can't even remember her name.  Oh, I bet I could if I had given a little bit of time. 
[01:15:00]  But she was it for me.  And we were in one class together.  It was business math.  And she used to sit, not right next to me, but one row over.  So I had to look past this fucking pig that I hated because she blocked my view of my true love.  When you'd get all weepy.  I would hear this song and be like, how could we end it all this way?  Me and you, we're a couple.  We're in love. 
[01:15:30]  Ew, what a dick.  Would you fantasize you sing to her?  Dude, I fantasize like.  I actually went through.  We were going out and then breaking up.  So I'd hear this song and be so upset that we were breaking up, but we were never together.  Jimmy.  What a fucking idiot.  You have to judge.  Which is worse?  The Hold Me Now, which is brutal.  I'm not going to lie.  Which is the worst story?  Come on.  How old were you, Ian?  15.  Okay.  Hold Me Now is worse because you wrote the lyrics out. 
[01:16:00]  We've all, because.  But he didn't even have a relationship and he's dreaming.  But you've also had those fantasies too.  I've had them too, but you wrote the lyrics out.  That's bad.  And in college.  Don't say what the fuck, Ant.  Adam from the UK, you stupid London cold weather.  Yeah, exactly.  No topless fucking.  Yeah, go have some crumpets or something.  Yeah, have a crumpet.  Thank you, Chip.  Yeah, why should I go say hi to the queen or something?  Look, the fucking girl.  I'm sure.  Oh, you never did that?  Hit the cheerio, you fucking asshole.  I bet you were in love with, too, with a girl with bad teeth. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah, you probably fantasize about a German girl bombing his home city.  Right, right.  Oh, I hope a fucking incendiary bomb that was in a basement that never got found blows up.  Yeah, or an incendiary bomb.  Incendiary.  Wow.  I also had one of those relationships that never was a relationship.  I used to follow a girl home.  Dude, right?  I followed a girl home.  I lived at least a block from the grammar school. 
[01:17:00]  It's never good to pause in this show.  You should never pause in this radio show.  All right.  I lived probably, I'm trying to remember, at least three miles from Harborfields High School.  I had to take a bus home.  Yeah.  But this girl lived close, and I found out she would walk home.  So my move was to walk home and try to talk to her.  And the bravest I got was to, like, get close to her as she's walking. 
[01:17:30]  And I never, ever told her.  And I followed her home for probably a couple weeks, making believe I lived close, too.  And the butterflies in your stomach, like, all right, today's the day.  You're just going to go up there, and you're going to say something.  You're just going to start a conversation, right?  Today's the day.  You had these fucking insane conversations with yourself, and just when it was time to do it,  I always just backed off and could never fucking do it.  And now I'll say fucking anything to anybody.  Now I will literally say anything to anybody. 
[01:18:00]  Like, I don't fucking care.  And I've looked up.  I've had the old days.  You don't give a fuck.  I don't give a fuck.  And then you look back, and you look at the girl and stuff, and you're like,  what the fuck was I even fucking worried about?  It's not stalkerish people.  You people don't even fucking remember.  Every guy did this.  Yeah.  It's not.  This was before motherfucking the internets.  You know, and day after day, she would make her turn to wherever she lived. 
[01:18:30]  And this is why it's not stalking.  I couldn't even tell you where the fuck she lived.  And now I'm stuck with a two and a half while I walk home.  Oh, God.  Yeah, that's pretty bad.  Because I knew I had, I only had, and I'm just making shit up now because I don't remember exactly.  I, let's say I had a half mile to make it happen.  Yeah.  To start the conversation.  And then sure enough, she would make her turn.  I'm like, well, now the stalking would have been to continue at that point.  Because now it's one of those local roads where you're like, okay, why the fuck?  I know everyone who lives on this road.  You don't live here.  Yeah.  So I knew I had to make the move before she made the turn. 
[01:19:00]  And every day I fucking couldn't do it.  And now I'm stuck with two and a half miles.  Oh, Jesus.  Wasn't it weird to be in a girl's neighborhood when you didn't live close?  Like, it was a weird feeling to be in her neighborhood.  Well, because if you were.  You'd always have to shit.  Like, I have nowhere to go.  You'd have the nervous shits.  Yeah.  The nervous shits.  But I never, never was able to do it, man.  And the butterflies in my stomach would just get to me, get the best of me and my lack of self-confidence, you know, and all that shit you'd deal with growing up. 
[01:19:30]  Well, at least you didn't, at least you didn't write her a note and put it in her locker and tell her if you want to know who I am.  Oh, the big mystery.  Wear this scarf the next day.  Dude, at least you made a fucking effort to do something.  No, but a couple of fags we are.  Yeah, but she never knew who it was.  She knows now, though.  And I told you, I read that note.  Oh, right, yes.  She still looks good.  She still looks pretty good. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, she's probably noticed the best decision she ever made.  She, um, no, but then I signed the note.  I forget, it was in Spanish.  And I, hold on, look this up.  Wait, you signed the note in Spanish?  In Spanish?  Hold on, let me see.  Oh, my God.  I'm having Sam look this up.  Write this, find out what that is in Spanish or write it down.  Oh, God.  El Luzero. 
[01:20:30]  I put a big Z for Zilcho.  Zilcho.  Boro.  Yeah, she was really a pretty girl, though.  I told the story, the one who I asked out on the phone.  Of course.  And she said, no, I don't think so.  I was trying to be funny.  I said, well, that's how the cookie bounces.  That's how the cookie bounces.  Yeah, now I really don't think so.  Jimmy. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, we all tried.  We all tried back then.  Oh, it was just nerve-wracking, man.  Oh, God, why?  You haven't?  The one is not right.  The damn hormones with these boners make you fucking lose your mind.  You're the assistant to the assistant manager of the movie theater.  Come on, rant.  Can't find it?  No, because it's an expression.  So it's like, I would be like, uh...  Do you know what it is, Sam?  You've got some Spanish in you.  Like, hablar del diablo?  Yeah.  Is that what you wrote?  I don't remember.  Whatever it was. 
[01:21:30]  Because it was Speak of the Devil in Spanish.  And I was an Aussie fan, so I think...  That was an Aussie record?  Why would you do it in Spanish?  And why in Spanish?  And why that line?  No, she wasn't Spanish.  Why would you do it in Spanish?  Because I was a douchebag.  Oh, you're an idiot.  See, my favorite...  Jim's stories are my favorites, because, like, you and Opie have these stories on some level  we can relate to, because we've all been there.  But Jim was such a delusional kid. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  Like, I would never get out of my head the vision of Jim walking by a girl's house playing  Iron Man out of boombox.  Because he's Iron Man.  Come on.  So she'd be like, oh, man.  Oh, hey, by the way.  Who's that guy?  That part of the lyrics is him.  You played the scenario out in your head that she was going to be like, oh, hey.  Hey, I like that.  Because he thought that every girl thought Aussie was as cool as he thought Aussie was.  I know, what are you thinking? 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, a real girl fucking band there.  Well, yeah.  Aussie.  That was not good.  No.  82.  It'd be like if I walked by a girl's house playing Hulk Hogan's music.  Oh, well.  Let me tell you.  You've done some weird shit, too.  I am a real American.  I'm either going to pull in Artie Lang or we've got to take a break.  What's the matter?  Oh, you've got to make wee-wee's.  Yeah, yeah.  I've got to make wee-wee's.  She's a dope.  We could continue after the break, or you guys could continue.  I don't give a fuck.  I've got to eat.  I've got to leak.  37, uh... 
[01:23:00]  Jesus, 7-fucking-40?  Wow.  We did good today.  I think we should go home now.  Let's just leave.  No, you did one break.  You've got more to do.  But one really long break.  It was great.  It was a great break, and like I said in the beginning...  What's going on in the front of your head right there?  Where?  That little dot.  Oh, I think you meant the fucking ridge.  The fucking...  No, just above your hairline.  Go up.  Up.  Right there.  Oh, boy.  What is that?  My hair parts.  No, that's where it begins.  Oh, boy.  That's where it begins.  Well, yeah, I mean, there's no secret about where my hair begins. 
[01:23:30]  No, but it's past your hairline.  There's like a dot.  Here?  Like something was like shaved out.  No, it wasn't shaved out, but it's just...  Because they're going to part it like that.  But a part is a line.  Let me see.  He's in denial.  See?  Look at that.  Right?  He's in denial.  See?  You think that's where a part is?  He's in denial.  I don't know what that is.  Uh-oh.  It's weird.  It's like a thumbprint of no hair.  Yeah.  Exactly.  I don't know.  Yeah.  That's what Robert Duvall had.  Just a part.  Just a part.  The worst horseshoe.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If you're a great actor like that, you don't deserve the worst horseshoe ever. 
[01:24:00]  Brady Bunch reboot.  Vince Vaughn behind new show.  Brady Bunch reboot.  Oh, good.  No.  Come on.  I got to know what this is because I am an aficionado of Brady Bunch.  They've just given up on trying to come up with new shit in Hollywood, huh?  Yeah.  They've just completely given up.  Yeah.  Do we need a reboot of the Brady Bunch?  They tried all that.  Yes, we do.  They did movies and everything.  The first movie was Brady Bunch.  And Casey Newsom Magic Johnson is Mr. Brady.  It's just...  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Look at that hairpiece on TV. 
[01:24:30]  Vince Vaughn and CBS.  They got a cast yet?  I got a leak.  You guys continue.  All right.  Let's take a break.  We'll be right back.  Sirius XM.  XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Does this mean anything today? 
[01:25:00]  Nope.  All right.  All right.  No birthdays or anything?  Who's birthday is it?  Who's birthday?  What song is it?  My chow.  My chow has a birthday.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Your chow has a birthday?  Chow?  Chow.  Chow.  Let me tell you about my chow.  You know what?  This fucking...  What happened?  This fucking Galaxy 3 is kind of getting to me.  What is? 
[01:25:30]  I'm telling you.  Samsung Galaxy 3.  Is that a phone?  The Samsung...  Yeah.  They make good phones.  I'm telling you.  And if I buy one, I'm shorting the shit out of Apple because there's...  Dude, I'm telling you.  I'm really...  You know what?  I really do like my phone a lot.  I was looking at someone's last night.  I got the Samsung.  And it is...  When did the Galaxy 3 come out?  Pretty fucking good.  When did it come out?  The Galaxy 3.  This one's only four months old.  I don't know.  It's relatively new. 
[01:26:00]  But I tell you...  What do you like about it?  Just that it's a little more computer-ish than the iPhone is.  There's a few more...  The iPhone's looking...  Features.  Slightly outdated.  It's looking...  It really is.  iPhone's got to do something.  I'm not saying it's...  It's cutting edge of technology when it first came out.  And everything else...  Don't even front yo.  So every other smartphone was using iPhone technology, but...  The iPhone's not shitty.  Don't get me wrong.  But it's starting to look slightly... 
[01:26:30]  Like, they gotta...  They gotta, like...  Because they haven't really stepped it up in five years.  They haven't, right?  No.  And now this Galaxy 3, I'm looking at it going like, I might fucking pick one of these up.  We have them for Verizon?  I might fucking pick one up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm looking going like, man, some of these features are cool.  The fucking picture-in-picture video.  I've been Samsung-ing for two years, man.  It's about time you give me some props.  Some slight props.  Well, I would if it wasn't for the fact that the only reason you got it is because you didn't 
[01:27:00]  want to get the iPhone.  Oh, true.  It was a default.  You got it by default.  Just to frustrate the people around me.  And you know what?  That's how sick I am.  Because, yes, that's the reason.  They have picture-in-picture video?  Yeah.  Like, you could be watching video and then you could check your email and stuff.  And the video will keep running, like, off to the side.  There's just little, a bunch of little features like that.  I like droid phones in general, man.  The whole fucking operating system.  This is my second Samsung, and I love it.  I really do love it.  Samsung are legit phones. 
[01:27:30]  They're really good.  I've had no issues with this, by the way.  And Samsung did, the last quarter, outsold the iPhone.  But the thing is, the iPhone is antiquated now until the new one comes out.  No one's really buying the old iPhone now because the new one's coming out.  But Samsung has been in the game.  They've been right there.  They're right there.  Apple has withheld technology.  Here's what Apple's done wrong.  They've withheld technology.  Like, before, they took them fucking three versions to put a flash on the iPhone.  There's all these things.  That's the whole thing.  They could probably do.  But if Samsung can do that with picture-in-picture, so can the iPhone. 
[01:28:00]  I still can't get flash on the iPhone.  It sucks.  You can't look at flash video.  I meant a flash on the camera.  Oh, no, I mean flash video.  You can't.  And that fucking is the most frustrating thing.  When you go to a site to see a video, you click on a link, and it's like,  Oh, you need flash.  I'm like, I'm fucking pissed.  Because they're bullying people into going to HTML5.  Yes.  And you know what?  Flash is here.  It's real.  And people are using it on the internet.  And if you can't watch it, it's very frustrating. 
[01:28:30]  They're going to bite their own ass.  I might be picking up one of these Galaxies.  And you know me.  Dude, you know me with the iPhone.  No one really knows me.  To tell you the truth.  I'm a fucking hermit.  You don't even know yourself, sir.  I really love the iPhone.  I'll tell you, there's some guy in the rest area that knows you.  Ryan and the gay Joe.  Oh, God.  Why did he?  All right.  But, I mean, I really do like my Samsung.  I like this.  I like it.  I do like the fact that it's a little figure.  What does this Galaxy 3 have? 
[01:29:00]  And I guess I've got to buy a new phone today.  Fuck.  I was looking at it last night.  I'm just like, God damn, this fucking thing is, it's very computery.  Well, I bought it for the media.  I feel like this takes better pictures than the iPhone and better video.  How many mega?  It probably is better.  4,800.  Oh, that's much better.  See, Apple's only, I think, three.  No lag on their pictures, too.  I was looking at the photos and videos.  No lag on the, you snap the picture, it fucking was instant. 
[01:29:30]  And the video was great.  I'm just, I'm kind of looking toward it.  And really, if I fucking defect from Apple, it's bad.  Because I am fucking hardcore Apple fanboy.  When's the next iPhone coming out?  September.  And I fucked up my bet with Travis because I told you the iPad was going to get it.  It was going to get smaller.  And the iPhone's supposedly getting bigger, but it's not really getting bigger.  And I told you.  I told you all that, but I was a little behind.  A lot of phones are, people are accepting a bigger phone now.  Yeah, they are.  As long as it's still, because the video is better. 
[01:30:00]  But the key is, as long as it's, you can keep it in your pocket, that's all people care about.  And the iPad is outselling every other tablet.  It's fucking blowing everything away.  It's not even close, right?  But the iPhone is starting to slip a little bit.  Slip because it's the old iPhone.  But if the 5 now, the 5 that's coming out, iPhone 5?  When is it coming out?  It's September.  So you've got to wait for that.  But if it's not really leaps and bounds ahead of the fucking 4S, ooh, there's going to be a fucking problem. 
[01:30:30]  Well, there's photos of the new iPhone that are supposedly out now.  Yeah.  I don't know if it's on, I can't say the word, Moto.  Game, Moto.  I guess Moto.  And I heard they're supposedly going with a smaller plug for the bottom charger.  So that eliminates every fucking charger cord you have.  How about the radios that you have where you can plug your phone into your shit?  They do that just to get an adapter.  Well, they said there's going to be an adapter, but who wants a fucking adapter?  What is it, a dongle? 
[01:31:00]  I need my dongle.  Where's my dongle?  I hated the dongle.  I don't even know what it is.  It was an adapter for your Ethernet.  That drives me nuts when they change their accessories.  It's like, how much money do you need from me, really?  Now I can't use any of my old chargers?  You're a fucking cunt.  They're supposed to be changing that.  Why?  What's the reason, though?  The other one's fine.  Yeah, what's the new one?  It's worked forever.  Just to go to less pins, I guess it's...  Is there a real reason besides they want to get more money out of you? 
[01:31:30]  That's what I'm asking.  Yeah, probably to sell more shit.  Yeah.  Is the number one reason.  And then they'll say, no, actually, technically, this is better.  What's this?  This is a video about what the new iPhone's supposed to look like based on parts, pictures of parts people have seen.  See, it's got to be thinner.  The Samsung is definitely thinner than the iPhone.  It's thinner.  It's bigger.  And I just...  I'm really digging it.  I'll tell you one thing they need to work on with these fucking Apple products, and I love Apple, is the volume. 
[01:32:00]  Like, even on the iPad, you cannot watch a movie.  It's hard to watch a movie with headphones on a plane because the bucket outside noise, you can't hear what's on the screen.  Why can't they figure out the volume?  I think they're trying to prolong battery life because the higher the volume, the quicker your battery will be.  I'd rather have shitty battery life and be able to hear my shit.  But it's that fine line where they're like, eh, we'll give people some fucking lower volume and we'll keep the battery power.  It's really frustrating. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  Dude, if I defect, oh, man, it's bad because I have just been a strong supporter of the iPhone and iProducts.  I guess in the end, I was right.  You know, it might have taken three or four years, but in the end, I was right.  In the end.  In the end.  It just looks pretty goddamn good.  They have...  I wouldn't mind...  You know, I'm...  Goddamn it.  Now, Ann says that.  It's like, I'm fucking...  You should take a look at it.  I'm going to look at the five first.  I mean, as much as I make it a bit, I did look at... 
[01:33:00]  I'm going to look at the five first.  As much as I make it a bit, I did look at both phones.  And I just like the Samsung better.  This one is four months old.  But the thing is, you'd been through so many other phones that sucked compared to the iPhone.  True.  I finally got something where...  That you were crying wolf.  It was the boy who cried Samsung.  Look, I've got an Etch-a-Sketch that you would make my phones on.  I really thought the Pebble was going to happen.  The Pebble stunk!  P-E-B-L.  It had nothing.  It wasn't only P-E-B-L.  It was a phone. 
[01:33:30]  Hello!  I liked it because it looked like a sushi rock.  It did look like a sushi rock.  And for some reason, that was cool to me.  It was like the Jitterbug.  That was before the smartphones, really.  That was the last hurrah for a lot of phones before the smartphones kicked everyone's ass.  Yes, indeed.  I went Pebble.  Look at that.  It's a cool phone, man.  It was all nice and soft.  Pebble stunk.  Pebble stunk.  At the time, it was cool, though.  No.  It felt like a soft rock.  It didn't have anything.  I liked it.  Fit right in your hiney. 
[01:34:00]  Hiney.  Crawl up the fucking Pebble.  Oh, then I went...  It's way mature.  And then I went BlackBerry.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The BlackBerry's done.  But now you laugh at BlackBerry users.  Done.  But for a while there, it was the phone.  Research in motion.  Done.  Their volume is great.  I probably bought two BlackBerry's that I should not have.  You increased their sales by 100%.  I was trying to hang in there.  And I finally was like, holy fuck, I can't hang with you guys anymore.  I'm sorry.  Might be gone with the...  And then finally went Samsung. 
[01:34:30]  How's the volume on your...  Can you play on your music?  Play Misty for me.  On the phone?  Yeah, play...  Yeah, what is...  Like, just from the speaker, how loud...  Like, I'll play a song off the iPhone, just from Louis R here, like a desktop level.  What do you want to hear, man?  Whatever, I'll play what I was listening to on the way.  This is full volume.  All right.  That's not bad.  Hold on, let me do one.  God, you're gay.  I realized, but I forgot how good this song is.  It's my favorite. 
[01:35:00]  Where's Mama Rotsy?  Fucking Colby, you can't say nothing around this cocksucker.  Mama Rotsy.  That was such a fucking thing, you crazy fuck.  Crazy like a fox.  Yeah, that's right, Chippa.  Yeah, just find a song on there and...  I'm trying.  It's a fucking...  Oh, she's hot.  Yeah, the new Chip...  Oh, man, who is that?  The new Chip...  That's Chip.  Your hat's adorable.  Come on, Chip.  The new Chip video is up, so just... 
[01:35:30]  Chip's hat is adorable.  Chip TV.  I was trying to find Do You Think I'm Sexy, but it's not available for mobile.  Where have you on my body?  Do you have anything on there?  Yeah, do you think I'm sexy?  Well, not really.  I don't need music on my phone.  No?  You might have one song.  No, I really don't.  How many gigs you got on that?  How many gigs storage?  Because the fucking Samsung...  4.5.  It's fucking crazy.  4.5.  It's fucking crazy.  4.5.  It's 8 million fucking gigs.  Oh, wow.  See, this is much less.  8 million, 4 billion, gazillion gigs. 
[01:36:00]  Mama Rotsy.  It's all I'm going to think of for the rest of the fucking millennium.  Right?  Right here we go.  Yeah.  Why'd you turn it down?  We want to see how loud it is.  Dude, that's fucking loud, right?  Yeah, he's holding it right to the thing.  Well, hold yours right to the thing.  I will.  Hold on.  No, I'm hearing it like without the headphones.  Pretty good.  Hold on.  I've never had a problem with the phone volume.  We're doing a show here. 
[01:36:30]  He's the one that lacks self-confidence.  Hey, no, I'm fucking with it.  We rock star.  One of your minions.  Who wins?  For song choice, mate.  He's going for you.  We never goof on Pearl Jam on this show.  We should do a whole break based around Pearl Jam.  Who's louder?  He's just so much louder.  Isn't he?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:37:00]  Sorry.  When Steve Jobs died, that was it.  No, I'm telling you.  I mean, you're not going to win the volume value.  No, I'm actually curious.  The iPhone volume, it's terrible.  Level stinks.  It's terrible.  Because I got iPhones in my family.  I just don't like them.  I use them.  I use iPhones when I need to use a phone and in a pinch or something like that, and I just  don't like them, man.  Look, I like the iPhone.  I'm not going to say I don't like it, but I'm starting to see that it's not the be all  and all of smarty phones. 
[01:37:30]  And I understand it's kind of stupid to say I don't like the iPhone.  I just prefer the Samsung.  And here's the thing I think also, as far as apps go, I don't know anything about the  Samsung apps.  Like how you get them, where you get them.  Where the fuck do you get them?  I know I could go to the Apple store and just buy apps, and it's easy.  Samsung, too, probably.  Yeah?  I'm sure they're compatible.  Yeah, they're catching up.  I don't think they're compatible.  iPhone was way ahead in the app department.  I'm not going to lie to you, but they're catching up. 
[01:38:00]  It's the Google Play Store?  What?  Yeah.  Ew.  What the fuck is that, Google Play Store?  Stop it.  I don't even like the sound of that.  Why are you yelling?  I don't know.  I'm always yelling.  It's on 1230 at night in your backyard.  Give me the fucking money!  Listen to the beginning of the show today.  Oh, my gosh.  Yeah.  No, they're catching up with apps, but I'm not an app guy like you.  I have a few.  I have Mr. App, they call me.  I have a bunch.  Mr. App.  They call me Mr. App. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Love a good app.  It has the facial recognition on the Galaxy S3?  What a terrible nickname Mr. App is.  Wow.  Mr. App.  That's what they call me.  All right, it's a micro USB plug, and there's a huge difference between 3G and 4G, so I guess...  What?  For the new adapter.  Oh, the new...  Oh, right.  Okay, because they're changing it to 4G.  Mike in Philly.  Mikey.  Mike?  I got 4G.  You don't even have 4G?  I have 4H. 
[01:39:00]  You don't have 4G on your iPhone?  Like a fucking...  Like a raising a cow for a fucking fair.  4G?  No, I always just sign my own name.  Ah-ha!  Boy!  Yeesh.  You don't have 4G?  Um, no.  I don't.  What the fuck's iPhone doing?  iPhone is, uh...  Moking the technology through one more version.  Just hanging out.  It's gonna fucking punch me in the face.  They're gonna take that chance a little... 
[01:39:30]  Whatever.  It takes over...  Wait, wait.  Yeah, and have his own app phone.  It's called over...  All right, look.  The apps are fucking good.  I need...  Let me see which apps I really use, though.  Let's be real here.  Let's be real here for a minute.  Probably would've worked.  Let's get real.  Yeah.  How about my Twitter?  All right.  I got Twitter rhetoric.  I got Twitter rhetoric.  Uh, what about my Bank of America and E-Trade?  Am I gonna get those apps for fucking, uh...  The Samsung?  Can I...  Can I do some banking and some, uh... 
[01:40:00]  Stock trading?  I really don't know.  How about my Apex fucking smart, uh, Apex so I could monitor my cameras, uh, my security  cameras?  How about my fucking, uh, uh, uh, my, uh, uh, iAqua link for my pool so I could control  my pool from my iPhone?  I would bet you would probably have a problem with some of those.  My Fios, uh, and my Fios remote so I could run, uh, all those.  How about the AR free flight, uh, uh, helicopter remote so I could use the iPhone or iPad? 
[01:40:30]  Well, I'll still have the iPad.  Um, how about my scanners?  Scanners.  Scanners.  Uh, uh, uh, ha, ha.  You know, I gotta ask these questions.  Well, let's go to Mike in Philly.  Mikey!  Maybe I'll just have it as a good boy or a naughty boy phone.  And I'll keep my iPhone.  Hey, boys, how are ya?  If you got two phones, you might as well take a chance.  Why not three now?  Three phones I do.  I'm like a fucking bank of phones.  Let's go, uh, Mikey.  Hey, uh, you guys, uh, you can get any app from the, uh, from the iPhone. 
[01:41:00]  You can get it on Android.  Uh, I have Bank of America.  I can get that app.  The Samsung S3 has facial...  I don't believe it.  What's your password?  Let me see.  Oh, yeah, sure.  You got the Bank of America app, you're saying?  Yes.  Wow!  Oh, God.  But anyway, you know how, like, if you're trying to read something on your phone and the  screen keeps, uh, dimming out on you, the Samsung S3 uses the front-face camera to recognize  your face.  It knows you're looking at it.  So it won't dim when you're looking at it because it knows you're looking. 
[01:41:30]  Wow, that's kind of cool.  That's pretty fucking cool right there.  Get it.  I love it.  It's the best phone I've ever had.  That's what I want a phone who knows I'm looking at it.  Yeah, hold on.  The future is here.  The future.  We're here in the future.  Ladies and gentlemen, something bigger and better than the iPhone.  Hey, Jimmy, uh, did you buy back into Facebook?  Oh, I need to know.  Yes, I did.  Okay.  I'm so fucking pissed.  When Apple took that big shit, I bought back in, uh, calls, but I sold, um, two days 
[01:42:00]  ago.  That's good.  I waited until it went up a little bit.  Sold.  It's been up 16 yesterday.  Hey, fuck it, it's, it's poised to go up again today.  I punched out too early, but, but at least you didn't buy Facebook.  Like, no, that Facebook is tanking.  You mean you bought twice so far, right?  Tanking.  Can you give us the history of your Facebook, um, trades, your transactions?  You started at 38, right? 
[01:42:30]  No.  Oh, no.  You, you, when it dropped the first time you bought it at what?  32, sold at 27, bought back in at like 30, 32.  What is it now?  Wait, you bought back in when?  Oh boy.  21.  Oh God.  Yeah.  You didn't know this?  No.  I'm sorry.  I was just, I thought you knew.  It's actually a 21, 71, 43% below their IPO.  We got a Citadel stock on our hands, people.  Oh my God.  We got a Citadel.  Wait, what, what? 
[01:43:00]  We have not mentioned Citadel in a while, but we got one.  It's Facebook.  People are getting, people are getting killed with this stock.  Yeah, yeah.  And, and they really thought this was supposed to be the big IPO.  The big Google.  You get in early.  Everybody was very excited.  It was going to shoot up, be another fucking Google or Apple.  No way.  And it's just tank.  It's a life lesson.  Yeah.  It's the famous, it's too good to be true shit.  We learned it.  We learned it with Citadel.  Well, I hope everybody else is learning it with this piece of shit Facebook stock. 
[01:43:30]  And they announced their earnings and, and apparently their advertising went down.  They're not getting that advertising revenue that they thought they were going to have.  They missed the Wall Street's estimates and it fucking just took a shit.  Too good to be true.  And there's nothing.  Always.  There's no light at the end of the tunnel with this stock.  No, because Facebook stinks.  Yep.  Yeah.  I should sell it again.  I'll just take the loss.  I'm not a fan of Facebook.  I update, but it's just, it's, it's not easy to, to maneuver around. 
[01:44:00]  No, it's not at all.  You need to.  Pillow fight.  Jessica poked you.  Fucking end our now friends.  You don't like this stuff?  No.  At least the mobile app works really well.  Wow.  What a piece of garbage.  Freezy McFreezer.  Why did they, why did they, Larry posted a photo on Marmalade's page. 
[01:44:30]  Who gives a fuck?  You're not, I don't like when they have to tell you someone became friends.  I don't care.  You don't know that in real life.  People just become friends.  I'm a penny in pre-market.  What?  Facebook?  Facebook.  Yeah.  I don't care if you're becoming friends with someone else.  Why should I care?  All that Facebook is good for is seeing what chick wants to fuck you.  You just go on, look at the messages, see what chick wants to fuck you. 
[01:45:00]  And you siphon out.  And you siphon out your messages.  And you fucking answer back.  And then you get naked pictures of the chick that wants to fuck you.  Fucking A, man.  You start looking at a pussy going, that's hairy.  Chip, you probably never get any nudes from any girls on Facebook.  How many fucking followers you got?  How many likes?  The maximum, like 10,000.  2, 10,000?  2, 10,000. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, Facebook annoys you.  I'm dumb to buy back in.  I just was dumb.  You know?  But that's the stock market.  You never know.  At the time, you weren't dumb.  You thought, okay, this must go back up.  There's no rhyme or reason to a lot of this shit.  Like I said, Apple missed its Wall Street estimates on the amount of iPhones that it was selling.  And they did great on iPads, but they missed their estimates.  They missed their price per share estimates. 
[01:46:00]  And it took a fucking shit.  It went down, I think it was 20-some-odd dollars the day after they announced earnings.  And they're back up to $614 a share, $614 a share, in about a week.  Wow.  Out of nowhere.  Like, all of a sudden, what?  The stock got better?  Right.  It's the same stock it was when it took a $20 shit.  It's just, it's beyond me.  Someone's moving and shaking this shit, man.  And it's not the people.  It's fucking Wall Street, not Main Street. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  I know what happened with Apple, actually, is that they found out that the orange crop was not affected by the bad winter.  Did Mr. Beaks tell you?  Yes, is that one scene where Anthony is talking to Anthony in the bathroom?  Oh, wow.  Clarence Beaks.  He was a Breakfast Club guy, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What a great fucking character actor that guy was. 
[01:47:00]  I think he's dead, right?  I think he finally passed.  I think he's dead.  He was a great character actor, though.  Yeah.  Played the exact same guy in every movie.  He was so good in The Breakfast Club, man.  Yep.  So fucking good.  Who did you relate to in The Breakfast Club, man?  You know, I was...  Oh, God, I'm so douchey!  Ah!  Yes.  Don't, don't.  Didn't we all want to be the fucking rebel?  I was absolutely Anthony Michael. 
[01:47:30]  Weren't we all?  I don't know, man.  I was a kid who had his asshole hair ripped out by a million of the rest of us who wasn't even in the movie.  Oh, yeah, because no one was the jock in the school.  I was the janitor downstairs.  You might have been the stoner.  No, I was never that cool.  So we were all Anthony Michael Hall?  We were all Anthony Michael Hall.  We thought we were cool?  He never even thought he was cool.  True.  He just knew he was a dickbag and not popular and never was able to hang out with the cool people. 
[01:48:00]  Rain keeps falling.  Rain keeps falling.  So fucking, oh, man, so meaningful.  He got him a fucking carton of cigarettes for Christmas.  It's fucking crazy.  Yeah, Dad.  Oh, yeah.  What about me?  Me.  That's a good scene, actually.  Oh, God.  What about me?  Yeah.  Smoke up, Johnny.  Oh, right.  Thank you. 
[01:48:30]  Can you find that scene?  Ali Sheedy was cute in this.  Molly Ringwald.  I didn't.  Molly Ringwald.  Overrated.  Molly Ringwald.  America's little sweetheart for a while.  Over-fucking-rated.  Not at the time.  In hindsight, perhaps.  No, she was very, very cute back then.  Oh, the fucking race.  Everyone loved Molly Ringwald.  Overrated.  Overrated.  Where's my people at?  Overrated.  Everyone loved her.  You thought she did.  She was America's sweetheart.  Overrated.  Molly Ringwald was never cute.  Look, Zippy.  Look, Zippy, Del. 
[01:49:00]  I don't give a shit what you say.  Everyone loved her.  Oh, really?  I was a child of the 80s, and in the 80s, she fucking...  Shut up.  She was fucking everyone's sweetheart.  I will blow your Molly Ringwald out of the water with Phoebe Cates.  Thank you.  Good night.  All right.  I win.  Again.  His gloves.  Judd Nelson's gloves.  Is that his name, Judd Nelson?  Yeah.  His awful open gloves.  But he's doing grunge before grunge, man.  Oh, boy.  Look at the grunge gloves.  Come on.  He's doing his little speech. 
[01:49:30]  Why don't we listen to it a little bit?  This is the quintessential 80s movie.  Go back.  Yeah, this is a great scene.  Rewind.  I like this scene.  What year is this?  Maybe it's a stupid scene now.  Let's see.  Let's see.  Mad.  This is a scene we were referring to.  It's Emilio Estevez, Michael, Anthony Hall, and...  Yeah.  Or Anthony Michael.  Really?  Yeah.  Judd Nelson.  Stupid, worthless, no good, goddamn, freeloading, son of a bitch. 
[01:50:00]  Son of a bitch.  Harded, big mouth, know-it-all, asshole, jerk.  Music's building.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  I got ugly, lazy, and disrespectful.  Shut up, bitch!  Who puts me turkey pot pie?  This is my dad.  Wait a minute.  Maybe I was this guy.  Fuck you.  No, dad.  What about you?  Fuck you!  No, dad!  What about you?  Fuck you!  Yeah!  Man! 
[01:50:30]  He's reenacting him being punched by his dad.  I don't know why.  You want to come over sometime?  That's bullshit.  It's all part of your image.  I don't believe a word of it.  You don't believe me?  No.  No?  Did I stutter?  No.  That was a good one, Chip, right?  Fuck yeah.  I would go, no, no, no.  That would have been funny.  You believe this?  Oh, shit.  What happened?  What is that?  What is it?  It's about the size of a cigar.  Do I stutter?  Oh, man. 
[01:51:00]  This is what you get in my house when you spill paint in the garage.  Oh.  Oh, the time we spilt the paint.  The time I burned the overactive.  I need this shit with you fucking dildos anymore.  Yeah, man.  Oh, then he runs out.  He's tortured.  He's tortured.  He's so tortured.  He's let his paint out, finally.  Yes, finally.  Oh, he knocks things on the floor.  Oh.  There's a lot of pain in that guy.  Oh.  Oh.  He's climbing.  He's been walking up the steps.  And Molly Ringwald's looking at him like, oh. 
[01:51:30]  Look at how pained he is.  He's pained.  His pain finally came out.  Fuck you.  His pain came out.  Fuck this guy.  His pain came out.  Oh.  He's a director now.  Is he?  Yeah.  Sometimes he's got to explode.  Judd Nelson.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's the director now.  I fucking knock things on the floor and tell a bunch of paper clips.  Yeah?  How'd that work out?  Fucking place.  It's like, oh, Chip, you're in pain.  Oh, Chip, you're in pain. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, I said, I am in, I said, I'm not in pain.  I'm in Spain.  I'm Spanish.  That's fucking great.  Fucking A, Chip, I'm in.  I was always in detention.  Were you?  Yeah.  My mother told me I should have been an astronaut because I took up so much space in school.  Yeah, I was in there and I was in detention just fucking cracking everybody up.  No, you weren't.  Yes, I was.  No.  I said to the redhead, hey, how you doing? 
[01:52:30]  Just a fucking drapes match, you pussy.  Oh, oh, yeah, yeah.  I was like, nice red hair.  What are you, Ernie and Bert or something?  They took shit much too seriously.  It's too seriously.  And that's moving.  Do you think it was too melodramatic?  So melodramatic.  And then when.  Yeah!  Yeah, dad!  And then when Molly Ringwald, like, puts her lipstick on with her tits and shit.  And he, like, starts ragging her about it. 
[01:53:00]  Like, she should have just been like, fuck you.  Shut up.  Yeah, relax.  Dick.  I hope your father burns your face.  Right.  The scene was.  But she's like.  You didn't do that.  Why did you do that?  Oh, shut up.  You're dramatic cunts.  Amelia Lester has had a good scene, though, where he describes the embarrassment of the  kid whose ass hair he ripped off.  Yes, all right.  Having to go back and tell his own father that.  I think that was a great scene.  I'll give him that one.  Find it, Sam!  Don't listen to this captivating chat!  Stop enjoying the show like a listener! 
[01:53:30]  I think he does that.  Sam's sitting there like a fanboy.  He loves this show!  I don't like him!  He loves this show!  With that giant fucking helicopter landing pad bald spot.  He's enjoying the show!  Oh, my God!  Find that damn scene!  Now watch it.  I watch it.  I think it's terrible.  Man, it's...  Yeah.  It's never true.  Are you trying to say he gets too caught up in the show sometimes?  He's a fan!  He really does.  Hey, we got someone that's got the Galaxy 3.  Someone we know. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, well.  My Galaxy.  Big A.  Oh, Big A.  What's up, everybody?  Hi, Big A.  How are you?  Just like the T-Mobile girl.  What's going on?  You got the Galaxy 3.  Yeah, about a week or two ago, I got the Galaxy S3.  Really, man?  Do I stutter? 
[01:54:30]  Hey, Dad.  This could take a while, but I'm going to ask him.  Yeah.  What does he like about the Galaxy 3?  Yeah, that's a good question.  Because we're all thinking of upgrading.  Sell me on it.  Yes.  I like the feature of it.  It takes a screenshot of anything on the screen.  All you have to do is pass your hand on the screen. 
[01:55:00]  You know, take a screenshot of anything on the screen.  What's it, constantly just taking screenshots when you pass your hand in front of it?  Say screen again.  Yeah.  Screen, screen.  Something about a screen.  There was a screen.  Something about a screen.  You're at the mall.  There was a screen.  Yeah, you're just screen, screen, screen.  Jesus, we heard you. 
[01:55:30]  It's got a screen.  You look at the screen.  Star of Stages screen.  What if you just inadvertently pass your hand in front of the phone when you're down there?  How inadvertently?  Oh, Jesus.  Big A, you got an answer to that.  What happens, Big A?  Only if you put your side of your palm.  You know, you put the side of your palm and move it either to the right or to the left. 
[01:56:00]  I mean, it's not, if you do it like all the, if you, the side of your palm to the right  or to the left, it takes it.  Wait, what about the palm?  Something about the palm.  Yeah, I don't know what you're talking about.  Yeah.  Yeah, explain. 
[01:56:30]  Use the side of your palm.  To do what?  And what does it do?  It takes the screen shot of anything on...  But how do you do it, and why does it not do it every time?  How does it work?  Um, I don't know if it takes every time, but you do it, um, you know, side of your palm. 
[01:57:00]  Um, against the, um, screen to the left or to the right.  Can you use your fingers on it, or what?  Well, that's a good question, yeah.  Um, I have, I have used, at the point of...  What's the best way to take the screen cap, though? 
[01:57:30]  I know you're trying to make me say, size of the phone, I know.  All right.  I don't...  He sounds it, but he's not stupid.  Yeah, I don't know, uh, if you sold this phone.  He did a terrible job.  What else does it do?  Like, how's the video?  How's the, uh...  Yeah, if you're just snapping a picture, how's the quality of the picture?  Oh, oh, cameras...  Amazing.  The camera and the video is very...  You strike her in the throat with the side of your palm. 
[01:58:00]  You yell, you yell, hi-yah, like it's karate, and you collapse the crib on her.  Oh, my God.  So, the quality of the phone is good.  I mean, the picture taken.  Yeah, it is very...  And also, the video is good, also. 
[01:58:30]  HD.  What kind of trees can you take pictures of?  What kind of what?  Like, if you're in Florida.  What kind of trees do you take pictures of?  Oh, Jesus.  Probably lush.  Exactly, Chipper.  Oh, fucking Chipperson.  Yeah.  They're a funny cunt.  Palm trees.  He's once in a tree with a bunch of fingers going,  Hey there, what's going on with you?  Double leaves.  Yeah.  Fucking double coconuts, cocksucker. 
[01:59:00]  Anything else about the phone, Big A?  Yeah.  Well, just like Anthony mentioned before,  you couldn't watch video and do anything else on the phone, also.  It's like magic.  I was watching video.  No other phone has that.  You so far said that you can put your karate chop it and it takes a screen cap and that  you can actually make...  You hold it to your ear and hear sounds. 
[01:59:30]  Right?  All right.  Sounds great, I guess.  Sounds great, right?  Sounds pretty good.  Sounds pretty good.  Big A sold me.  Yeah.  On the iPhone.  Yes.  Yeah, I hope they don't go to you for advertising.  Yeah.  Big A 614 on Twitter.  Look what I just did.  Oh, he's down a few.  Yeah.  Big A.  Big A.  Big A did a great job of selling that. 
[02:00:00]  I think so.  You ought to be in advertising.  You watching the Olympics, Big A?  Sad men.  What do you like about the Olympics?  Right, Steve from Bayshore.  Hey, what do you like about it?  Come on.  I like track and field.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, that's good.  They haven't started that yet, though.  Yeah, what are you talking about?  What else do you like? 
[02:00:30]  Swimming gymnastics.  Swimming gymnastics.  I got to check that one out.  I haven't seen that one yet.  It sounds hard.  It sounds really hard.  Swimming and gymnastics.  Oh, well, you didn't say that.  I'm swimming gymnastics.  You didn't say that.  Yeah, you said swimming gymnastics.  Yeah.  You like all the asses.  You can see a lot of Olympic asses.  I thought you meant the show. 
[02:01:00]  All right, Big A.  Very good hearing from you, sir.  Absolutely.  I'm going to check out that phone.  Bye-bye, Andrew.  Take it care, Jimmy.  What about us?  Take it care?  What about us?  Yeah, what the fuck?  Did he say take it care?  Yeah, he did.  What about me?  What about it?  Yeah, what about Sam?  What about everybody else?  What about Sam the fan?  Why are you just singling out Jimmy?  Yeah.  We have feelings, you know.  We used to say goodbye, Andrew. 
[02:01:30]  That's why.  That's true.  I did.  Well, I said, all right, Andrew.  Or Big A, whatever.  I said, all right, Big A.  Fuck.  That usually means, okay, Ope.  All right.  Yeah.  All right, Ope.  And Sam and Travis and everybody else.  You used to do track and field when you were younger.  You know that, right?  Yes.  Oh, yeah, you did.  You were quite the athlete back in all the day.  What was your event?  The face bite. 
[02:02:00]  Anything?  I'm scared, which I know it's on track and field, but I'm scared, which I did.  What?  You don't remember what event you did?  How do you not remember the event?  Exactly.  The pole break?  How do you not remember if you did track and field? 
[02:02:30]  Did you actually run track and field, or did you take the baton and instead of handing  it off, bludgeoning the girl?  No, I did the track and field, but...  Yeah.  Duty Cookies is saying that you did the girdles.  The 100-yard drive.  I think.  You don't know, huh? 
[02:03:00]  That's weird.  A little weird to me.  Yeah.  Would you do the shot put?  No, no, no.  Would you run the 100-meter dash?  The javelin?  The long jump?  The 50-foot traipse?  The high jump?  Yes.  Would you do the two-mile galavan tour?  I don't know.  Galavan.  Galavan.  Do you know how to bust the two-mile galavan tour? 
[02:03:30]  Galavan.  Oh, God damn.  Oh, shit.  Nothing.  No.  I'm upset.  I need to know.  I know.  What did you do?  I kind of need to know.  I think I did the 100-yard dash.  Yeah.  Sorry.  He did the 100-yard dash, but he was in the triathlon. 
[02:04:00]  Did you do the 350-pound jerk?  All right, big A.  Bye, buddy.  All right.  Take care, everyone.  Say hi to Ron for us.  Right.  Yeah.  Your other friends.  I haven't called in or been on the program in ages right now.  Oh, you got a problem with Ron?  Yeah.  What's the matter with that?  No, not at all.  What happened with Ron and Fez?  Why won't you call them?  Yeah, I'll make sure Ronnie knows you got a problem with him. 
[02:04:30]  I don't have a problem.  I just said, say hi to Ron.  You said, I don't call him anymore.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  It did sound like something happened.  What happened?  I'm loyal to you guys.  Wow.  It's too late for that now, isn't it?  Why is that?  Maybe you should have realized that before you did 180 appearances on Ron and Fez.  But it's fine, wouldn't you?  I love Big A.  I like Big A, but if Ron booted him off the show and then he comes crawling back to this show. 
[02:05:00]  Yes.  He's loyal to us.  Wow.  Can you look up the word loyal, Sam Roberts, please?  Why would you want to be loyal to this show when you look back at some of the fucking people that we've had?  Stalker Patty?  Bobo?  Where is Stalker Patty?  Why would you want to be in that fucking illustrious?  I bet you nothing has changed in Stalker Patty's life.  Well, I have another minute of vacation time.  I practice my good hygiene.  Oh, stop it.  And I listen to the Beatles. 
[02:05:30]  You know how I picture Patty washing her vagina?  Oh.  You ever see those giant things?  You go, they look like giant perfume sprays, but they kill insects.  They spray bug spray.  I know what you're talking about.  What is the name of that?  I don't know.  A big bellows?  You don't know the real name.  Like a bellows?  Jesus.  How do you know what that is?  I don't know.  The bellows?  The bellows.  What's that?  Is that if the bell borrows money?  Bellows.  Fucking Chippison. 
[02:06:00]  The bellows a few ringy things.  Pay up, motherfucking bell.  Dong, dong.  Cocksucker.  You guys want the definition of loyal?  Sam, if you will, please.  Unanswering in allegiance as A, faithful in allegiance to one's lawful, sovereign, or government.  B, faithful to a private person whom fidelity is due.  C, faithful to a cause, ideal, custom, institution, or product. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah, that's not you, Big A.  Oh.  Okay.  Yeah.  Unless you can be loyal to two people.  Right.  You're more like, um...  This is another definition.  Complete ass.  All right, so we'll let Ronnie know you've got a problem with him now.  Yeah.  Is it a Fez thing, or you just have a problem with Ron?  Sexual tension?  Mm-hmm.  I don't think it's... 
[02:07:00]  Since Fez came out,  Big A has shunned the Ron and Fez show.  Yeah.  You're homophobic.  Are you?  No, no.  You like the gays?  Not at all.  You good with the gays?  Of course.  Anyone who says of course has problems.  Yeah.  He's saying of course because he doesn't like them,  but he's let a few of them suck his dick for car fare.  Of course.  Mm-hmm.  What was it about the Ron show that got to you? 
[02:07:30]  The Ron show.  Did you call it the Ron show just now?  What are you doing?  What's the Ron show?  Holy shit.  Is that bad?  Ron has a co-host.  Call it the Ron show?  Jesus.  I didn't mean to say that.  Ron and Fez.  I think you...  I'm pretty sure you did.  No, I didn't mean it.  It just came out.  That's how you think of the show?  It just came out the way.  Because it's Ron and Fez still.  Yeah.  Fez is there.  All right.  Fez.  So what did Ron do to you?  Nothing. 
[02:08:00]  Nothing at all.  I mean...  But you obviously got tired of him.  What was it?  Oh, I didn't get tired.  I mean...  He never showed you respect like we do?  Why are you laughing at that?  Oh, man.  Why are you bashing fucking Ronnie like this?  A big A.  Ronnie's a good guy.  I sure hope this doesn't get back to Ronnie.  Great interviewer.  And you're just shitting on him.  Yep.  I hope...  Yeah, I hope this doesn't get back to him.  I hope so.  Guy's a saint on earth.  And what you're doing is... 
[02:08:30]  I always...  I always...  I always...  I always...  Easy for you to say.  Exactly.  Okay.  You know, Spider, you're...  Always funny.  Always funny.  Oh, boy.  Has he ever done this spider for us?  Spider, you're stuttering, muttering, fucking prick, yeah.  We haven't done that bit with you yet?  What do you want?  Fuck, we should do that bit with you.  Anthony, you got a problem with what I did?  Making me think what I did over here.  Hmm.  All right.  All right, Big A.  We learned a lot about Big A today.  He's got a phone. 
[02:09:00]  I like that Galaxy...  He's got the Galaxy S3 there.  And he has a problem with Ron.  From Ron and Fez.  I don't have a problem with Ron at all.  All right.  Well...  Ron's a comedy genius.  You can't now backpedal right at the end of the call about just shitting on Ron Bennington  like that.  Backpedaling.  He is backpedaling, Edgar.  I don't like it.  Edgar.  Why do we use these names with him?  It's Jimmy.  I don't know.  I swear it's Jimmy.  I know it is.  Big A, thanks for supporting us.  The FH Riley's, by the way.  Just fucking buy right into it. 
[02:09:30]  Shut up.  Big A.  Shut up, Big A.  Big A.  Big A.  No, it's a long A.  It's not a short A.  Shut up.  It's a long A.  I'm Big E.  Big A.  All right, Big A.  I don't think we got the proper FH Riley's plug in there, though.  Oh.  I didn't hear it. 
[02:10:00]  I know you didn't.  It's not proper, yo.  FH Riley's, 400 New York Avenue in the heart of Honerton's Village.  There you go.  My brother's play's still going strong, thanks to Big A and others.  Yep.  All right, Big A.  I'm going to take care.  Later.  Shut up.  Later, gator.  Garbage.  Let's go to break.  Okie dokie.  You know there's nothing in the news today?  What?  It's the Olympics.  We did the Olympics.  Oh, that's right.  What else are we going to say about it?  Nothing's happening. 
[02:10:30]  Don't say that, because every time something is not happening in the news, a huge story breaks.  What do you mean?  That's when we get in trouble.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Well, that's why I'm acknowledging it ahead of time.  I remember right.  The problem with the Olympics is no one's winning gold medals.  I haven't seen a gold medal actually won.  I remember I said, like, right before 9-11, I said, like, wow, there just hasn't been one of those big stories.  You really said that?  Yes.  It's terrible. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah, but you said it two years earlier.  Yeah, well, you know, it was before, technically.  Exactly.  You said it on 9-12.  We're like, how about a touch of yield?  All right, we'll figure out what to do next.  SiriusXM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Yeah, we know that.  Ha, ha, ha.  Noises.  I kind of like that one.  Noises.  I don't know what the fuck I was saying.  This show is very musical.  I was saying noises.  Very musical. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah?  Yeah, I think it is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  By the way, Ari yesterday?  Shafir?  Yeah, he was very good.  With two Fs?  Yes.  Yes.  Then I was listening to the after show, and Sam sounded like a little bitch.  Why?  He sounded like some little, like, star-struck bitch with him.  You were giggling and like, oh! 
[02:12:00]  It's funny.  Are you saying something funny?  Well, you know what?  Funny's funny, but you really kind of sounded like you were giddy.  You think so?  Yeah, a little bit.  Why were you giddy?  Just a little constructive criticism.  Maybe that's something I've got to work on.  Yeah, you don't want to sound too eager.  I used to, back in what they called the day.  So you get it.  And I remember that happy-to-be-there thing, and if I could go back in time, I would tell  me not to do that.  This is like you doing that. 
[02:12:30]  Yes, you are, I'm like Marty McFly.  I'm coming back in time to tell you, my dad, to, you know.  Show the fuck out?  Well, hook up with the chick.  Getting confused.  A little bit.  All right.  Jesus.  Ant, there's hope for you and your ex.  Wait a minute.  No, there is. 
[02:13:00]  You don't mean ex-wife, do you?  Yeah.  New York couple.  Uh-huh.  Hear me out.  New York couple, 85.  They're both 85.  85.  To remarry after 48-year divorce.  Oh.  This could actually happen.  Oh.  Okay.  Sure.  But what happened?  What were their problems?  I don't know what their problems were.  Why'd they get divorced?  They're just getting married again.  That's silly.  I don't know.  I just want to use the headline to kind of fuck with you a little bit.  I don't really care about the story.  Fucking way. 
[02:13:30]  They got married in Tennessee, Chattanooga, while they were still teenagers.  Oh.  Young love.  They had four children during that time, but later divorced.  All these years later, the two remained on good terms.  Hmm.  And then, like, even would give the new wife pointers on how to deal with him.  Ugh.  I hope he punches her.  Goddamn.  Found themselves single. 
[02:14:00]  I hear someone selling hot dogs at a bar in Huntington.  Really?  That's what I hear.  What's wrong?  I don't know.  What bars sell hot dogs?  I don't know.  It's one of those little fucking hot doggy things.  That's her job?  That's what I hear.  What happened to the money?  Godspeed.  I don't know.  What happened to the money?  I don't know.  Buy a house, and then, you know, do whatever the fuck else you want with the money.  I don't know.  The Huntington Tavern? 
[02:14:30]  What?  I don't even know where that is.  I don't know.  What's with the question marks?  Does it be?  I'm mad at Roland.  Why?  What happened?  What happened to our donuts from the flea market?  The flea market's on the weekend.  I am not fucking you.  So then why would he offer us donuts from the flea market?  Yeah, he's bullshitting us.  He's bullshitting us.  Thank you, Sam.  Why would he do that?  But I don't really want to fuck with Roland today.  He's got that look today.  He's on a tear.  He's angry pandan.  Yes.  And we don't know why, but something happened.  Oh, we should play the fucking, uh, the Sal. 
[02:15:00]  Angry panda bit.  Uh-oh, here comes Roland.  God, that was so funny.  You liked it?  It was so funny.  Zito didn't think so.  Zito did.  Hold on, hold on.  When he was owning Sal.  Oh, shit.  Oh, he owned him.  That's after show shit.  I don't give a fuck.  Roland.  Shit.  Roland.  Yes.  I'm a little scared because I see it in your eyes.  You're an angry panda today.  Oh.  Why are you an angry panda?  I'm not angry.  Why would you look at anyone?  Hmm?  What happened?  Those are my stomach hurts.  Why?  Uh-oh.  Probably because of breakfast. 
[02:15:30]  What'd you have for breakfast?  A healthy wrap?  That's going to be soon.  Are ya?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Why can't we get donuts?  It's on Sunday.  Yeah, but you offered donuts.  Yeah, I offered it.  You offered knowing that we all don't hang out on weekends usually.  I thought it was a show thing where you come in with the flea market donuts.  I will.  I'm going to go to Williamsburg on Sunday and pick them up.  So we'll have them Monday? 
[02:16:00]  You'll have them fresh on Monday.  You're going to try a flea market donut?  Nope.  But they do have a place in Carroll Gardens, too.  Where's that?  I don't know.  What are you yelling again?  I don't know.  I just Googled it.  It's at Carroll Gardens.  I've never been.  Carroll Gardens.  Yeah, it sounds dangerous.  It does.  And what's going on with our meatballs?  They're going to come next week.  And when do we get more Sunday gravy shit?  Balls are coming next week?  Sunday gravy could do this week.  And when are we supposed to get deep dish pizza before we go to Chicago?  Some of that pizza, yeah.  If you like. 
[02:16:30]  Well, yeah, we like.  We've said it for a while.  We want to get ready for our Chicago trip.  Are they going to ship it out from Chicago?  Or are we getting some of that New York Chicago deep dish pizza?  We can get it from Chicago.  No, we want the New York version of deep dish pizza.  That's only Uno.  Oh, really?  That's the only place?  I think.  Yeah, pretty much.  That's bullshit.  Because all they have is that and Sicilian.  That's bullshit, yo.  That's bullshit.  I know that's bullshit.  Sicilian ain't Chicago.  There's an Uno's on Central Ave. 
[02:17:00]  Like.  They have one on.  Great.  Shut up.  Not this again.  Like Ronnie said, Chicago deep dish pizza is like lasagna soup.  It's got to be.  It's not Sicilian.  Sicilian pizza is regular pizza on like doughy fucking thick doughy square bread.  All they have is stuffed pies in New York.  And stupid Chicago deep dish pizza.  It's they just dump the tomatoes on there and mush it all together with some cheese and some fucking dough.  And it's a big slappy fucking mess. 
[02:17:30]  Nice.  Yeah, because they put dough, cheese, the meat, the more cheese.  And it's sliced.  More cheese.  Like fucking.  What kind of cheese they put on there?  Rigol.  Mozzarella.  No, it's a mozzarella.  Mozzarella.  Is it mozzarella?  Yeah.  I was thinking lasagna.  Lasagna does the rigol.  Arricot.  Arricot.  I like head cheese.  Head cheese isn't even cheese.  Edgar.  Edgar.  You rock.  Try the head cheese.  I love it.  Really?  Block of head cheese. 
[02:18:00]  Why are you laughing at the mention of Iraq?  Anytime Iraq's eating.  Iraq, you ate head cheese?  What is head cheese?  What is that?  It's in here.  It's people cheese.  What is it?  Isn't that like.  It's the cheese that's in charge.  It's a chart of taste.  The head cheese in charge.  Yeah.  So you have to say it on TV now.  Exactly.  What is that head cheese?  Wasn't it leftover like meats that were put into a gelatin?  I thought you ate it.  I think I did.  Head cheese is fucking violent. 
[02:18:30]  It's like eating an autopsy.  It's like.  Oh.  That shit they hose off the table at the end.  One that was left down in the sun a little too long after he died.  That's what Quincy revealed.  Oh my God.  I can't imagine.  Could you eat an autopsy?  If you had to.  Just if you had to.  Can I eat a body part?  No.  No.  If you had to.  To eat an autopsy is to eat a body.  No.  No I understand that.  I couldn't.  Newman.  Newman.  Yeah.  Newman.  His was the most.  The most. 
[02:19:00]  Newman.  Kirk.  Getting emotional.  I know.  Fucking love it.  I know that one.  I watched the Wrath of Khan again.  Why?  Over the weekend.  I can't not watch it.  Once.  It tasks me.  I can't not watch it.  Once is good enough.  No because then I start thinking like why is a veteran Starfleet crew running a training  exercise like the Kobayashi Maru at the beginning.  Oh you think shit like that?  They have everybody there.  Spock.  Fucking.  Tetley.  It's Tetley.  The security guy.  Yes.  Fucking Scotty Bones for some reason the doctor is on the bridge simulator when they're 
[02:19:30]  running the Kobayashi Maru.  Why?  I don't know.  It doesn't make any sense.  My answer is I don't know.  Well you know what?  I'm going to keep watching it until I figure out the answer to all these questions.  Was that the first Star Trek movie?  I didn't know.  That was the second one.  What was the first one?  The first one was just Star Trek.  Star Trek the motion picture.  Star Trek the motion picture.  And it was a little.  They were trying a little too much for a 2001 A Space Odyssey thing. 
[02:20:00]  Oh okay.  It was very antiseptic looking.  It was a sterile environment.  And the Wrath of Khan was seen as a very good film.  Wrath of Khan was one of those.  Yeah.  It was finally some action.  Some phaser fights.  Ships going at it.  I like the reboot.  I know.  I like the reboot.  That was great man.  The reboot was great.  They're doing another reboot.  The reboot's great.  And what I hear.  Why are they doing another one?  They're filling it.  But it's been a couple years already.  Next year.  It takes a while to do that one.  Fuck that.  Why?  Because it's a fucking huge motion picture. 
[02:20:30]  JJ Abrams and by the way.  And I hear Khan is in this one.  I hear this is going to be a Khan kind of fucking one.  The name of this one is actually Star Trek 2.  Spock buys a hat.  Not the hat.  Enough about that.  It's called Space Age Polident.  He tries to keep his choppers in his head through the galaxy.  He has the wind resistance picks up even though there's no wind in space.  No wind.  His teeth are rattling.  Yes, the solar winds.  I wonder if solar winds are.  Do they really blow like regular wind? 
[02:21:00]  No, it's.  They come blowing in.  It's.  It's not wind.  It's not air.  Right.  So what is it?  It's like fucking particles.  Like when the sun blows out those big.  Those big.  Sun spots.  Yes.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  I actually did not know what that was.  So where were we?  Well, I was also asking.  Why?  What?  In the Wrath of Khan. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah.  I love that movie.  Can't get enough of it.  Dude, I don't remember it.  I should probably watch it again.  Oh, I'd love it.  You'll hate it.  Just because it's outdated and kind of badly acted.  Remember the badminton players that we talked about earlier?  You know.  They all committed suicide.  Well, they have been.  Disqualified.  Booted.  Really?  Because they didn't play.  It's a great video.  Fair and square.  Let me see.  Do we have the video yet?  This video is amazing. 
[02:22:00]  They didn't want to play the chinkies.  Oh, chinkies.  I mean.  It's crazy.  Sorry.  Yeah, they.  Is that a bad one?  Yeah, it's a bad one.  I apologize to everyone who was offended by that.  Waddle be doodle.  Get out of the way.  Right away.  The Chinese.  No one wants to play the Chinese.  So they threw the game.  Yeah, they were just throwing.  How could you see them throw it?  Watch, watch, watch.  Throwing the shuttlecock right into the net.  Watch.  They weren't playing.  Look, they're not going for anything.  Just sitting there. 
[02:22:30]  They're throwing the match.  He let that one hit the ground.  Boo!  And everyone's like, what the fuck's going on here?  Watch.  They're just throwing the game.  It's the weirdest fucking video ever.  Wow.  Look at that tiny little tennis court looking thing.  They're not even hitting it back.  Because they don't want to play the Chinese.  Which ones are the Chinese?  Are they the Chinese right there?  I don't know.  I don't know.  It's hard to tell.  Honestly, yeah.  South Korea?  South Korea.  Now they're booing because they're like, okay, I see what's going on here. 
[02:23:00]  We see what you're doing.  Boo, South Korea.  Boo, South Korea.  But now they're just laughing because it's hilarious.  They're playing badminton like any one of us would play it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We'll fucking.  Watch, watch, watch.  What a disgrace.  Look, they won't even fucking hit the.  What is it called?  The birdie?  The shuttle cock.  The shuttle cock.  The shuttle cock.  So I guess they're disqualified.  They're done.  Good.  They should be.  That's disgraceful.  But they've been training their whole lives and then they get fucked. 
[02:23:30]  It's not the spirit of the games.  True.  Yeah.  You've got to play.  And then the referee, look, he is pissed.  Like, you can't do this.  Man.  Now he's saying, play.  Look, he's like, come on, let's do this.  Let's get it out.  You see that?  Yeah.  It's like a fight ref.  Then he goes back to his thing.  And then they don't do anything, right?  Yeah.  They're like, okay, we heard you.  Now watch.  We're going to make it look good.  And they hit it right to the net. 
[02:24:00]  Unbelievable.  Watch.  They just aren't doing anything.  But both sides are trying to throw the game, right?  I don't think so.  Good.  Look at the fucking disgraceful.  Look at my hairstyle.  Another.  Wow, China with a hairstyle.  It's on.  But wait, China is, how is China throwing it if no one wants to play China?  Uh, I don't know.  I don't think China was throwing it.  Sam, because now I'm confused.  But watch.  Right to the net again.  They never really played a point. 
[02:24:30]  At least the whole time.  So stupid.  Fuck.  Oh, there was actually a volley there.  Yeah.  The teams that were investigated were two teams from South Korea, one team each from China  and Indonesia.  Why were they both trying to throw the game?  That's, that's weird.  I don't know.  Why do they want to lose?  Supposedly China's like the best and no one's going to beat them. 
[02:25:00]  Why was China in trouble then?  Yeah.  I don't know.  And who gives a shit?  I don't know.  Badminton.  Badminton.  Badminton.  Badminton.  I don't know.  Sam, can you read?  What, what, what happened?  Badminton.  Roling.  Badminton.  Badminton.  Badminton.  Badminton.  Badminton.  Badminton.  Badminton.  Badminton.  Badminton.  Oh my God.  You guys are saying it like so much.  No.  We're scared of it.  Valid, Jim.  We don't understand.  It's valid.  I don't understand the letter N in a lot of words. 
[02:25:30]  Well, I don't, I don't like it either.  Badminton.  Like my neighborhood.  Badminton.  Sam.  Badminton.  It's in the rules of the tournament.  Teams blame the introduction of a round-robin stage rather than a straight knockout tournament  as the main cause of the problem.  If the round, in the round-robin format, losing one game can lead to an easier matchup  in the next round.  Oh.  Oh, so you lose and they're like, all right, let's put this asshole team against the fucking  shitty team.  But again, that's funny. 
[02:26:00]  They should be, I'm, they're all kicked out?  Yeah.  That's great.  Get the fuck out.  Yep.  Good.  That's why the Olympics stink, by the way.  The Russian, you know what's funny?  Well, it wasn't the Olympics.  Bobby Fischer used to accuse the Russians of cheating like that.  I could cheat.  I did cheat in chess.  Because they wanted to set it up a certain way where they were all Russians, so they  would lose certain matches to make sure other matchups happened.  Yeah, that's what's going on here.  Yeah, exactly.  And Fischer was yelling that in the 60s.  The fucking Soviets!  You know.  Well, the Olympics should have figured that this was a possibility.  If you could throw a game and then play a shittier opponent, why wouldn't you do that? 
[02:26:30]  And they were stupid because they made it obvious they were throwing the game.  You could throw a game.  Yeah.  You'd get a few volleys in and all of a sudden you hit it just a slightly, you know what I  mean, a little harder.  If you want that shuttlecock to go over the net, that's pride fucking with you.  Can we read Samuel L. Jackson's tweets?  Did he have any good ones overnight?  I wasn't paying attention to Twitter, nor was I paying attention to the Olympics.  I was too busy having fun. 
[02:27:00]  Jimmy Kimmel?  What?  He had the celebrities read tweets that people trashed them.  That's pretty funny.  What was it?  It just doesn't have anything to do with anything, isn't it?  What tweets?  Tweet, tweet.  What are you talking about?  You never want to be told.  What are you talking about?  The worst that you never go.  I don't know what Roland is saying.  I'll just bring donuts tomorrow.  No, Flea Market Donuts.  I don't eat Flea Market Donuts. 
[02:27:30]  No, they have a store in Carroll Gardens.  I'll wake up early.  Carroll Gardens again.  Go in the open and I'll bring it back.  Where's Carroll Gardens?  It says here Brooklyn.  They're going to go all the way to Brooklyn?  Is that like Marvin Gardens on Monopoly?  Yeah, or Carol Burnett or Carol Brady or maybe Carol O'Connell Christmas Carol.  A lot of fucking carols.  I was fucking voted most likely the young carol at a weird time in high school.  And Carol, I've never heard that name on a man before. 
[02:28:00]  It's a Donald Sutherland line.  Yes.  Little Murders.  Don't call me Carol.  I don't turn me on to that movie.  Oh, I haven't seen that one.  Little Murders is very funny.  Good?  Really funny.  Yeah, really bizarre movie.  Where are you getting these donuts from?  Carroll Gardens.  What's the name of the place?  Doe Donuts.  Doe Donuts.  Doe Donuts.  Doe Donuts.  I don't know what a Doe Donuts is.  Doe Donuts.  Doe Dummy.  How about some?  Yeah, exactly.  How about some fucking couscous couscous? 
[02:28:30]  Can we call it the couscous loop?  They're amazing, though.  They're a fuck package.  Yeah, I've heard of them.  Yeah, they're fucking amazing.  Let me see.  I've never heard of Doe Donuts.  Doe Donuts.  What are they?  Are they Donuts or are they Doe Donuts?  What is it?  They're magical.  Did you just say...  They're retarded donuts with Down syndrome.  Did you just say Donuts are amazing?  Of course they are.  Donuts.  These are beyond amazing.  No, every donut is amazing.  Every donut's...  There's bugs on that one.  That's no good.  That's a blood orange.  What are those?  Exactly.  I hate blood orange.  Why do they have...  What is that? 
[02:29:00]  Why do they put scabs on it?  They put scabs on their donuts.  It looks like fucking...  It looks like one of those blood boogers.  It's blood orange.  What is that?  Blood orange.  What do you mean blood orange?  Caked blood boogers.  You don't know what blood orange is?  It's delicious.  I know it is, but how do you get that in a donut?  Oh, I don't know.  Maybe.  Does it look like caked blood boogers?  What's that shit on there?  It's delicious.  These donuts are awful.  I hate this place.  I hate this place.  I want Dunkin' Donuts.  You don't want a Doe Donut?  No, I want Krispy Kreme.  Dunkin' Donuts.  Or Dunkin' Donuts.  Da Dunkin'.  Da Donuts.  I'll bet you these are good.  Dunkin' Donuts taste like shit. 
[02:29:30]  They're still?  No, they don't.  I wouldn't even feed the homeless people Dunkin' Donuts.  You said still?  Still.  I like Dunkin' Donuts.  That apple one is fucking amazing.  What's that?  And then the Bavarian cream.  Ew.  It's good.  A Boston cream, too.  Oh, I love Bavarian cream.  Dunkin' Donuts.  It's worth the trip.  Oh, wow.  Nice.  It's going back a ways.  It's an old one, right?  Jimmy, maybe you could get it out of him.  Roland is fucking pissed today.  Why are you pissed?  I'm fine.  Tell us.  We can maybe help you out.  We're good.  Is it what we did or somebody behind us? 
[02:30:00]  Somebody imagine.  We're good at solving problems.  Some imagine.  What happened?  I'm good.  That's what Roland would say.  I've been checking out how Roland talks and why he says certain things.  If he said, why are you mad?  And he'd go, it's something with management.  Yeah.  Instead of saying, it's something with management, he would go, it's some management.  It's some management.  It's some management.  And his worst tell is when he says, I'm good.  Okay.  I think he's annoyed with you guys.  Are you annoyed?  Why?  Yeah.  I think so.  Why?  I'm fine. 
[02:30:30]  That's my own personal.  We said yes.  I know.  In the end, we said yes.  Roland's words all melt into each other is what happens.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  He hates being accused of bullshitting.  It's his biggest pet peeve.  I didn't say he was bullshitting.  Oh, well, the donuts.  I think he's lying about that.  He hates that.  That's my impression.  He's never said that to me.  It doesn't sound like Roland.  I was just confused.  He offered us donuts from the flea market, and the donuts aren't here today.  And then he goes, well, that's Saturday and Sunday.  And I said, well, why would you offer us the donuts?  Because we're not here on Saturday and Sunday.  That's all that was about.  Tomorrow, they open early, so I'll go in the open. 
[02:31:00]  What time are they open?  How are you getting it?  You're going all the way to Brooklyn to get us dumb donuts from Dodo Donuts?  They're amazing.  Why don't we have an intern get them?  They're probably at Lawson.  Ah, E-Rock.  They're your people.  Yeah, exactly.  Tell one of your fucking dumb people to go to Dodo Donuts and get us some fucking Dodo Donuts.  He's not been a great leader, I don't think.  No, he's a terrible leader.  He really is.  I bet you E-Rock won't fuck the Dodo Donuts rules up.  Oh, boy.  Those directions.  Yeah.  And bring back a box for me. 
[02:31:30]  I found out literally last week one of the interns didn't know how to burn a CD.  Come on.  Oh, boy.  I didn't know whether to blame leadership or the internet.  Is that a generational thing?  Maybe these kids don't need to know that.  No, a CD's not that old yet.  It's all digital.  Who cares?  And besides that, he really should have been taught by E-Rock.  The head of the interns.  I don't need to know who the head intern is.  The boss of the interns.  Is someone actually asking me to post the badminton footage? 
[02:32:00]  What's wrong with these people?  Yeah, just Google.  People don't know how to Google anything.  Holy fuck.  They don't know more difficult.  Maybe some of that weird, rare shit, but...  Yeah.  They don't know what Google is.  Yeah, just put badminton in.  Oh, yeah.  Google.  Just type out badminton, badminton, badminton.  I'm so glad they kicked these cunts out.  Just Google badminton.  Badminton.  Man, do you think they're upset they got booted?  Nah, they don't show any emotion, those people.  Oh, boy.  Jesus.  Oh, boy.  Is that rolling like that one? 
[02:32:30]  Oh, it's fencing.  Fencing.  Fencing.  And then fencing's a dumb sport.  I don't know.  It's pretty duct-tangular.  Sabunis.  I thought this...  I thought this...  Oh, it's the light.  It's like a laser tag.  Two touches away from advancing.  Just a straight attack in the middle.  Oh, you can see where you're in it, it lights up.  It's purple.  Zagunis threw fastball.  Got her on a very easy touch.  Not just for Mario Zagunis, but for all these competitors.  How tough is it in your hall of 1.00 to the Olympics to be right on point?  my sword at the next person what was that scream after four years of hard training and traveling 
[02:33:00]  competing all of a sudden here's the moment and sometimes she's kicking that chick's ass i would  just be swinging the sword going karate chop three to two in this match wow she's stuck in a 12 to 4  run just smack over there is within one touch of advancing  i wouldn't wear a helmet that's pussies wow ungal chance of usa here at the excel protectors  oh and she got her again that just stinks i know she's got the fucking she's got the sword

All right, we got this other part we're going to work on.  And then they never got to that part is what I'm saying.  That was the other night.  Everyone says they're brilliant.  Do you like Iraq's hand on your leg?  No, no, no, no.  Oh, man.  No, no, no.  She didn't like it.  I didn't say she didn't like it.  Did she?  Is she married? 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  Where was her husband?  So was Iraq.  He didn't seem to care.  That's true.  About his wedding vows.  A sordid affair.  While she's five feet away.  Oh, yeah.  She probably dozed off and he took the opportunity to start feeling some leg.  Iraq, this has gotten a lot worse than it was.  What was it that your sister said?  Yeah, what did she say?  About the incident.  Yuck.  Yeah.  He's on his phone again.  Good morning, everyone.  What?  She wants us all to leave.  Oh.  Well, yeah. 
[03:01:00]  What did you...  Oh, we have to know what your sister said.  I'll check the nanny cam again.  Relax.  Oh, man.  We got the nanny cam.  Let me go over the footage again.  Got one of those secret nanny cams?  Yes, I do.  Many of them.  What did she say?  And I'll have a full report on this.  And I will actually time the incident.  Dude, if you could get that video.  Actual video evidence of Iraq fucking molesting your sister.  It wasn't a molestation.  It sounds like it was.  I've learned it's molestation.  Molestation. 
[03:01:30]  That's like to say badminton.  Badminton.  Badminton.  Badminton.  Yeah, if you were molesting your sister.  Yeah.  Were you molesting my sister?  No, I was not.  Apparently was.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  How did the leg feel?  Soft.  I guess.  Whoa!  What the fuck?  Yeah, E-Rod.  What are you doing?  E-Rod.  That's fair.  I mean, it's nice and all that you would say good, but fuck.  Now it's getting weird in here. 
[03:02:00]  What?  It is.  A minute ago he didn't do it.  You felt the heat on your hand and her leg.  Yeah.  You can't not feel it.  Did you feel my sister's heat?  Yeah.  A little bit.  Was she pushing into your hand?  No.  But she wasn't moving it, and that was a weird silent signal.  Yeah, yeah.  That is the best feeling when they push.  Oh, when they push into it.  Push back a little bit.  When a girl shows she is ready, willing, and able.  He was like in Boogie Nights.  Feel, feel, feel, feel the heat.  Feel the heat.  So you felt that warm leg, and she wasn't pulling away, and that was what the turn on 
[03:02:30]  Why would you say it felt good?  You just asked.  It's getting weird, man.  You enjoyed the feeling, and you asked.  So did you move your hand at all on her leg, or did it stay stationary?  Okay.  Up until this point, I didn't even realize I was touching her.  Yes.  If I accept, do you remember how good it felt?  Did you give a little squeeze?  No.  You know, between the thumb and fingers?  No, I bet it was the back of his leg.  No, the back of his hand.  Oh, the back of his hand?  Like in casual, and he probably would press down a little bit while he was showing. 
[03:03:00]  Let her know that it's there.  Yeah, and she didn't move, so she was saying, hey, look, the ache is where you think it  is.  You're filthy.  Dirty birdie.  I just wish I knew what Oak's sister had said.  I would love to know that.  Yeah.  I'll get back to her.  Yeah.  You've got to let us know.  I want to know what she said.  It's so uncomfortable.  Because I didn't feel like this needed to be on the air today.  What?  Fucking subordinate.  At all.  I really thought this was like a who gives a fuck. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah.  What?  Well, it is.  All right.  But, you know, we just want to know what happened.  I gives a fuck.  Why do you give such a fuck?  It's very interesting.  It is.  God.  Iraq, you should be mad at Sam.  Very presumptuous, Iraq.  Really?  Why?  He's pushing this.  Explain that.  He's pushing this.  I'm on my phone.  I'm making believe nothing's happening.  Yeah, this shouldn't have been brought up because you brought it up.  Of course it shouldn't have been brought up.  But you're over it.  You're all good.  Prove that I brought it up.  We got the tape. 
[03:04:00]  Shut up, Sam.  Okay.  Do you remember how this conversation started?  Yeah, I just brought it up out of nowhere.  I didn't bring it up.  Jimmy started, like, kind of pushing it.  I wasn't there.  Jimmy pushed, though.  But Opie said, no need.  And we all know I can't help myself at times.  I was fine.  And then Jimmy's like, hey, so...  But talking about donuts.  You were hanging out with Iraq.  I didn't know what happened.  I wasn't there.  You're the one that said the leg.  I didn't know that even happened.  But Opie said, no need to mention how your hands are.  So he said, no need to do it. 
[03:04:30]  Thank you, Anthony.  And then E-Rock started...  That's a record show.  I was trying to avoid the situation.  And then E-Rock started introducing the situation.  I did not.  Jimmy did.  There's no need.  Jimmy had nothing to do with it.  I didn't know it was like...  There's no need me.  Come on.  Jimmy goes, oh, so how was your weekend with E-Rock?  No need me.  Even though it's Wednesday.  Jimmy brought it up.  And I was like, it's really no need to.  Yeah.  And then...  How did Jim find out?  I don't know.  That's kind of strange.  Oh.  Oh.  That is kind of weird.  Jimmy's just touching himself right now. 
[03:05:00]  I didn't know that it happened.  Why are you touching yourself as we talk about my sister?  Because it's hot the way he was seducing her.  This is getting fucked up, man.  He was seducing her.  He felt the warmth of her body against the back of his hand.  We all have sisters in this room.  Let's relax.  That's right.  E-Rock's going to fuck them all.  Oh, E-Rock.  Yeah, no letting E-Rock around your sister.  Jimmy was touching himself?  Yeah.  He was.  Jimmy, why?  It's just in his pocket now, but he was venturing.  Why were you fiddling?  Just because it's so hot, the idea of the back of that hand pressing the leg and her 
[03:05:30]  not moving, giving silent consent.  Silent consent.  Oh, that's great.  Love silent consent.  Yeah, me too.  Even if it's due to...  Sam, let the record show I was avoiding this situation today.  Rufies.  Is that what the record shows?  And I was doing a good job.  You did say it.  Yep.  You said, let's not bring it up.  No need to bring it up.  That's right.  No need to bring it up.  No need means no need.  And then how is it brought up?  I don't know.  Somebody then mouthed off about it. 
[03:06:00]  No, he said no need.  Then you fucking jumped on it.  And that brings it up.  No.  No, it didn't bring it up.  You said.  I said no need.  I said.  Look, here's how it went down.  I said no need.  But then people would be like, no need for what?  And I go, well, no need to bring up the fact that E-Rock had his hand on my sister's  leg.  And that should have been the end of it.  Should have.  But then there were questions from me and Tim going, what are you talking about?  Yeah.  Yeah, we had to ask.  I mean.  But at that point.  I didn't know that happened.  I was showing good faith.  After E-Rock bragged about it.  By introducing the subject.  You said there was no need to talk about it.  Yeah, there was no need. 
[03:06:30]  Kiss and tell motherfucker.  And then blame Jimmy for it.  He just started blabbing.  Nope.  That's not what happened.  Locker room.  Talking about his sexploits.  It's crazy.  Sex bagelploits.  Sex bagelploits.  Sex bagel.  Yeah.  Remember the sex bagel?  Mm-hmm.  There really was no need.  Jesus, E-Rock.  He was on there for a while, wasn't he?  It's low.  Your sister wanted to hang out with him again?  Oh, no.  No, never again.  Afraid.  Oh, boy.  Fucking restraining order type of shit right there.  Mm-hmm.  That's restraining order shit. 
[03:07:00]  She was probably in stunned disbelief, which he misinterpreted as sexual tension.  Yeah.  I bet you that she was uncomfortable, and you felt that her sex was throbbing.  Like Sandusky.  Fucking pervert.  Jesus.  You thought it was body heat, but it was really uncomfortable, because she didn't know what  to do.  The girl's just trying to fucking sit there and look at your dopey-ass pictures, and you're  feeling her up.  Didn't she used to consider her like an aunt?  Oh, man.  No.  She didn't want to get you fired by blurting it out, like, what are you doing? 
[03:07:30]  Yeah, exactly.  I'm the boss's sister.  What are you doing?  Yeah, what were you doing?  Now that we brought it up.  Boy.  Now that we finally brought it up.  We're finally bringing it up.  You know what?  I'm all in now.  What the hell?  Let's bring it up.  In the light.  It's on the table.  Now it's on the table.  What were you doing?  Just being nice.  That's not nice.  What are you doing?  Coming.  I already explained this for the last 20 minutes.  You lied.  You said it felt good?  He saw something he liked.  He went for it. 
[03:08:00]  Look, could you please explain it for 14 more minutes?  Yeah.  Not to mention the hour that follows, by the way.  Right.  Wait, are you not going to drop it?  No.  Why would you?  I don't know.  I see what's going on.  I don't know yet.  You should drop it.  You think so?  Yeah.  This should not have been brought up in the first place.  It's hurtful.  Right.  It's hurtful.  But E-Rock thinks that you...  What are you checking your phone for?  Nothing.  Did you take discreet photos of her?  Oh, God, E-Rock.  What a pervert.  You didn't steal her phone and take all her pictures off. 
[03:08:30]  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Why would he do...  Oh, right.  He has a bunch of self-nudes.  You didn't ghost her...  What is it called again?  You're saying because he's done that to her family members before?  Oh, right.  The ghost thing?  You didn't ghost her phone.  He loves the hueses.  I don't even know what to do so much.  You know, like when you steal Opie's photos?  Stealing shit from Roland so he can give it to his son.  Yeah.  Here.  Stealing.  Jesus.  E-Rock didn't mention it was...  You didn't mention that, Roland.  Yes, I did. 
[03:09:00]  Oh, you did?  I did.  I didn't remember hearing that.  I didn't hear that.  And that one, I said, this is stuff from Roland.  I did get a box of stuff, too.  Thank you.  All right.  Can I...  Oh, maybe I can come upstairs and give you a gift.  Is your sister out there?  Yeah, maybe we can...  We were just going to go home, but he invited us up, so we came up.  I did.  How could he not?  I did for a half hour.  Take liberties with his sister.  Exactly.  Good guy.  Exactly.  He just thought you'd give him a gift.  Welcome.  Didn't even realize it was a stolen...  No, there'd be something you would be taking in return.  Exactly.  He didn't realize you were trying to get a DNA sample on your fingers. 
[03:09:30]  Oh, my God.  That is terrible, right?  Terrible, but all too true.  Oh, my God.  You weren't trying to get a DNA sample of my sister, were you?  No.  Okay.  He wants that Hughes DNA.  You're not trying to clone me, are you?  No.  All right, good.  Have you in the past?  Try.  I bet he goes in and smells your toothbrush and sucks on it.  Oh, my God.  Do you do that here?  No.  I bet he looks at your toilet and he goes, this is where the piss sock was. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah.  And he looks like...  He probably actually mouths the words, right cheek, left cheek.  And he traces his fingers around the toilet.  How weird would that be?  Do you trace your finger around it and then shove it in your mouth like peanut butter?  No.  I don't know my teeth.  Hubie hairs.  Do you lift up the toilet seat and scrape out anything that's brown and just hope it's  his?  Brown.  Did you ever take a shower at Opie's?  No.  Never?  Nope.  No.  Not at all. 
[03:10:30]  No?  You want to keep that smell on your hand, right?  That's why you don't shower.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  You touched her leg?  Oh, fucking.  He said it was warm.  He did more than that.  And good, he said.  You touched her leg?  Yeah, he said it was warm and good.  I never said it was warm.  Yeah, you did.  I think she did.  Of course she was warm.  Someone said it.  I think you did.  Someone said it.  I didn't make that up.  Yeah, this really didn't need to come up today.  Yeah, I agree.  Roland just texted me a question.  That's a braggart.  Why doesn't Roland come in here himself? 
[03:11:00]  Because he doesn't think that I'm just going to shout him out.  No, Roland texted me.  Hey, Sam.  What does Troy think of all this?  There is a rumor that...  Fucking Roland.  It's a good question.  He thinks that I'm going to be the shitster.  Right.  This is Roland.  We should ask Troy.  And there is a rumor going around that Roland really likes this.  What likes what?  The fact that E-Rock got caught putting his hand on my sister's leg.  Did you tell him before?  I didn't tell him.  Wait, there's a rumor going around.  When did this rumor start? 
[03:11:30]  We were talking about this in the same room.  Monday morning this rumor started.  Where's Troy?  Where would Roland have found out about this?  How's someone get Troy?  Yeah, where's Troy?  That's fair.  It's only fair.  Here he comes.  Okay.  Oh, boy.  Oh, it's Troy Kwan.  Hey, Troy.  I don't want to get involved.  Oh, man.  I just want your...  You're a very open-minded individual.  And there's a...  Your many years of experience.  It's not even a rumor.  It did happen. 
[03:12:00]  You know, he said he doesn't want to get involved, for the record.  A-Rock was leaning into my sister on this big, huge couch.  I can't keep my mouth shut.  Showing pictures of his new house.  And he might have...  No, he didn't might have.  The record will show.  He did.  That he had his hand on my sister's leg.  For the whole time?  For a while.  Oh.  When does it get weird?  Is it all right to put your hand on somebody?  For maybe a couple seconds?  I mean, if it's like...  Yeah, yeah.  Breathe.  I mean, something like that.  But even that would be uncomfortable, because it's your sister? 
[03:12:30]  Yeah.  It was a good 20 minutes.  Then they listened to Paul McCartney together?  Well, we all did.  Yeah, but you all didn't have your hands on each other's legs.  Did he walk in at some point and go,  Hey, you.  Get your goddamn hands off her.  You know?  Back to the future.  I bet you that he was talking sexy.  Well, you know, the foundation was laid.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Here's the bathroom.  Here's the bedroom.  Let me show you where they buried the pipe. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah, you rock.  Sexy talk.  See, you gotta be careful here,  because if you don't do the electrical work right,  sparks will fly.  Oh, shit.  You think it was an innocent, like, thing?  Probably?  See, I don't even know if I want to comment.  The dehumidifier's down here,  just in case things get a little damp.  Yeah, you know.  I never forget to pull out of the garage.  Oh, shit.  We got a sump pump,  because things get really wet down there.  Yes. 
[03:13:30]  Hey, can I put my balls on your nose?  Oh, wait.  It doesn't quite fit the...  This is why I didn't want any of this brought up here, Ron.  Yeah, see what you did here, Ron?  What were you going to say?  Oh, shit.  Oh.  Well, you know.  Ron's loving this.  Yeah.  Oh, he's freaking out in the back.  He is.  He's free loves us.  Let the record state.  Yeah.  Eric can be a little creepy.  You think so?  Yeah.  Now, you think so?  You've seen that before?  I don't think it was creepy. 
[03:14:00]  Well, yeah.  I think he has a perfect, you know, answer for this.  Oh.  But it shouldn't have been brought up in the first place.  Absolutely not.  Yeah.  I don't know why it was.  I agree.  Absolutely not.  And everybody knows it.  Now that I'm getting my friendship back together with E-Rock, it's absolutely not even brought  up today.  Oh, yeah.  You two are like two peas in a pod.  Yep.  One giant one.  I mean, all anybody has to do is talk about direct messaging.  Oh, shit.  What's going on there?  I don't know.  You tell me.  I know. 
[03:14:30]  Exactly.  Jesus.  Right.  Do you think E-Rock knew his hand was on the leg?  Do you think he did?  Of course.  Of course.  It's fine.  I mean, maybe.  Is your sister hot?  I don't know.  I think she's right.  I hope he gave her a seven because we're on the radio.  Off air, though, he put up the four fingers.  That's what E-Rock did.  Put up the four fingers.  All right.  I've got to get back to work.  E-Rock, you look very upset.  That would imply you were working before. 
[03:15:00]  I don't blame E-Rock for being upset.  There's no business being on the air.  There's just an innocent moment for 20 minutes at my apartment.  Get rolling.  Howling.  Moment for 20 minutes.  What?  Is that Rowling howling out there?  Yeah, you hear me?  Oh, yeah.  Why is he howling?  E-Rock, why does Rowling like when you're in the barrel?  Because it takes attention off of him.  Oh.  Shit.  Jesus.  Because he's avoiding whatever he was pissing him off.  His hand wasn't on someone's sister's leg.  What are you talking about?  Get rolling into him.  So you know that there's something bothering Rowling today. 
[03:15:30]  I saw it as soon as you started bringing it up.  You could see it in his body language.  Yep.  All right, so you're saying that Rowling is lying.  Oh.  Rowling.  All right.  Around the circle.  Now it's just got it.  He's saying you're lying.  Yeah, now it's got real.  Now it's real.  He's not sharing.  Ooh.  She just got real?  Yeah, E-Rock noticed that you're in a bad mood today as well.  And now this is you avoiding your bad mood by making fun of him.  He's saying that you manipulated this whole thing to avoid your bad mood.  Yes.  I didn't put my hand on his sister's leg. 
[03:16:00]  Good one.  No, I'm not fine.  I'm fine.  Just my stomach is killing me.  You're owning him like Zito was owning Sal.  He killed him, right?  Definitely.  He killed him.  Sal looked like a fucking dumb piece of shit.  Wow.  He did.  Ouch.  He did.  Sal did use big words.  Yeah.  Now E-Rock is looking real bad.  He is a transient.  A transient.  I was like, what?  That's a big word.  Murdered by a transient.  He did things with the skin. 
[03:16:30]  See, E-Rock, what are you looking at on your phone?  More house pictures to go of with your zipper open?  Was your fly open there?  Of course it is.  Whenever those house photos come out, cock knows it's time to play.  This is why this shouldn't have been brought up.  It should have never been brought up.  It's very exaggerated what really happened.  And it's fucking embarrassing for everybody involved.  I mean, it left the fact, you know, remain that it was 20 minutes and that's it.  A little self-control.  Nothing else happened.  Just assume like that.  It's very presumptuous of you to think a girl is going to enjoy you fucking rubbing her leg 
[03:17:00]  with your wife standing right there and she's married and you're fucking, you know, perving out on her.  Wow.  See, this is why it shouldn't have been brought up.  It shouldn't have been.  It was a very innocent thing.  20 minutes of innocence right there.  There's been a lot said about it.  A little too much.  E-Rock.  It's just he said moment before, but 20 minutes, it's like so many moments.  More than a moment.  It's a lot of moments.  Well, the Paul McCartney song alone is about seven minutes and 30 seconds. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah.  Is it the live version?  Huh?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You touched her while listening to Paul?  Do you remember that part, you rock?  Nope.  Is this your song?  Yeah, this isn't.  So, were you mouthing the lyrics as your hand brushed her thigh?  Blowing them into her ear.  See?  I thought it was nice. 
[03:18:00]  E-Rock looks very upset.  Why are you upset?  Well, you got three minutes.  You know what's a good exercise?  How would he know that?  I'm sorry.  Fair point.  Fair point.  That's not nice.  Fair point.  That's not nice.  When you have E-Rock go around and list who he's upset with the most in which order.  Why?  It's always me.  I hate when it's always me.  Why can't it be different for once? 
[03:18:30]  I have a feeling he's more upset with somebody else.  All right.  Okay, E-Rock.  All right, I got hope.  Go around the room who you're most upset with.  But it's always me in the number one position.  Well, when you're the number one hero.  Exactly.  You take the biggest hit.  You're the number one emotional target.  E-Rock, start with the person you're least upset with.  The intern sitting next to me here.  Okay, fair enough.  Because he didn't do anything but look adorable.  And he had to get molested for a bit.  Yeah, exactly.  He had to reenact the crime.  Yeah.  Troy's not in here, but he's associated with it because he was in here. 
[03:19:00]  All right.  Who are you least upset with next?  Anthony.  All right.  Come on.  Why?  I always put right in under the wire like that.  What have I done?  Nothing.  Besides just pound you relentlessly.  You didn't initiate this.  That's true.  That's true.  I'm just a fucking innocent bystander.  I so didn't initiate this.  Yeah, me neither.  Because I see it already.  I'm going to be the number one again.  I'm going to fight all the way.  Who's the next one you're least upset with?  You know what? 
[03:19:30]  I'm going to have to say Sam.  Yes.  Wow.  Holy shit.  Wow.  Sam must be tired today.  You know what?  No, I know what that's about.  What?  It's all about air time.  It's all about air time on the after show.  Really?  Oh, it's the fucking Sam and E-Rock show.  And, you know, if you let E-Rock fucking dictate it.  I don't think that's the case.  E-Rock likes his air time on the after show.  And it's a different E-Rock.  Yeah.  It's the confident.  It's very strange.  Fucking bon vivant E-Rock. 
[03:20:00]  We're friends.  Why are you so different on the after show?  Comment, E-Rock, why?  Comment, E-Rock is my favorite phrase.  I love comment, E-Rock.  Okay, so who's after Sam?  Wait, why is he different on the after show?  Yeah, why different?  Yeah.  Well, let's see.  If I say something, I'm not getting the mash theme, a fat joke.  Oh, another fat joke.  Everyone dies down for a little bit.  There you go.  Yeah, but that's not enough.  Besides all that.  I think almost eight years of that is enough to validate why I don't talk. 
[03:20:30]  He's been able to complete a record number of sentences on the after show.  Yes.  Yeah, it's always strange to hear him actually get to finish a thought.  All right, who's next?  Jimmy's got to be number one this time.  How?  You're left with Roland, Troy, Jim, and Opie.  What the hell did I do?  I was even there.  Off to go with Jimmy. 
[03:21:00]  Thank you, E-Rock.  He was the one that said, how was your weekend with E-Rock?  It's Wednesday.  That's a fair question.  I didn't know what happened until it was Wednesday.  It's Wednesday.  Ran out of steam.  We had to bring it out.  We had Roland, Troy, and Opie.  Opie.  I'll go next with Roland.  Why Roland?  Because he's complaining about getting credit for a toy that I had told people. 
[03:21:30]  Troy, you realize it's between me and you as the one he's most pissed at.  You've been part of this bit for ten seconds.  And I know I'm going to be number one again.  It's bullshit.  Dude, I left the room so I didn't say anything.  He actually fucking showed restraint and got himself out of the situation.  What were you going to say?  I haven't said anything about you yet.  What was I going to say?  Troy and Sam should be switched easily.  Thank you.  No fucking way.  Holy fuck.  Sam didn't instigate this.  No, I didn't.  How is Troy, it's obvious, the runner-up guy you're most pissed at? 
[03:22:00]  I left the room.  Bullshit.  I've had Iraq side the whole time.  The only thing I said was direct messaging.  That's all I said.  It's not right.  Not right.  It's not right.  It's not right.  This whole thing shouldn't have been brought up.  Of course it shouldn't have.  And Sam, you better play the tape because I did say it shouldn't have been brought up.  Yep.  And you also should play the tape of Jimmy fucking starring the whole fucking thing.  He should be the number one guy.  Man, Jimmy.  But I didn't know that happened until you said it.  Jimmy should be the number one guy because I would have never said anything.  A little prodding and then I'm like, oh, I see what's going on here. 
[03:22:30]  And then I even said we shouldn't bring it up.  But then when you say you shouldn't bring it up, people out there are like, bring what up?  And so I said, bring up the fact that Iraq had his hand on my sister's leg.  And that was going to be the end.  I figured that we would just.  Jimmy number one.  And what the fuck did I have to do with this?  Yeah, you know.  You had nothing to do with it, but you showed up anyway, so.  Oh, man.  This is just bullshit.  Did Jim not say for me to come in?  Well, let's get it over with.  You're mad at me again. 
[03:23:00]  Let's get it over with.  You're mad at me again.  Who are you mad at?  Above Roland.  Big surprise here.  Above Roland?  Yeah.  And he's not going to be mad at Roland because Roland hooks him up.  No, Roland's in third place.  No, I wasn't mad at him.  But Roland's never going to be first.  Roland's a shit starter.  He's a shit starter.  I've got to be first again.  But in this situation, what's going on here?  He's obsessed with me.  These two stoked the fire.  And he's obsessed with that.  You didn't do much to help, by the way, Troy.  I removed myself from the room, so I didn't do anything.  Yeah, but you threw gas on first.  Yeah, you cryptic comments. 
[03:23:30]  All right, go ahead.  He knows what that means.  You really are responsible for a lot of this.  Who's the runner-up guy you're most upset?  Oh, I think we're out of time here.  We're past 10 o'clock.  Yeah, but we don't mind going a couple minutes late.  I love going late.  Me too.  Really?  Yep.  You do?  I sure do.  Hearing Opie in the record show.  Or inappropriate.  Late a lot.  Go ahead.  Say it.  Might as well say it.  Peace out.  Go ahead.  Say it over Roland. 
[03:24:00]  What did I do?  We're not the answer.  No.  Roland, he's pointing at Anthony.  I'm okay.  Yeah, he's safe, right?  Opie and Troy have yet to be listed.  I'm going to be the guy, even though I said it shouldn't be.  Irock.  Go ahead.  Let's get it over.  Finish it up, Irock.  Come on now.  Come on, Irock.  Finish it up.  Always has to be me.  You're mad at it.  Well, if it is what it is, it is what the end of the end of the end of the end of the  Whatever it is, it is.  Yeah, don't change it now.  Yeah, don't change it now.  Why would you be mad at me?  What did I do?  He's just here.  You're the runner-up guy.  So then why would you be mad at me? 
[03:24:30]  Troy, let him list you before you get upset.  He hasn't even mentioned you yet.  Yeah, but why would I be second place?  He hasn't mentioned you.  Dude, except second place, I've got to be number one again.  Yeah, but you brought this up.  Again, every fuck...  I didn't bring it up.  You did bring it up.  Jimmy brought it up, and I said, this shouldn't be brought up.  I didn't even know it happened.  I was just going to ask about the boring weekend.  And then I heard the listeners out there go, bring up what?  So, of course, you've got to give them that knowledge.  And then I said, let's move on.  But why do you have to give them that knowledge?  Fine broadcaster.  I'm a good broadcaster.  I paint the pictures.  I would love to know how this list rounds out, though. 
[03:25:00]  Go ahead.  But let's get it over with.  Let's find my button.  Maybe I could learn from this.  Don't beat yourself up.  Whoa.  Iraq, do you want some belly button?  Oh, no.  People were Twittering me that last night saying that you came in your belly button.  I didn't.  Oh.  I'll give you a little belly button, and you can finish up the list.  Come here.  That's fair.  A little belly button for Iraq.  It'll bring everyone together.  Just catch him in the room.  Come here.  Come here. 
[03:25:30]  A little belly button.  Let's catch him in the room.  Ooh.  Oh, man.  Is the intern allowed to smell it?  Yeah, you can smell it.  No, I don't know if the intern can.  He can smell it.  It's just the smell.  What?  Can I smell it?  I want to smell it.  Okay.  Get a good one.  Get a good one.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  It's very vinegary.  Thank you.  Vinegary.  I, you know.  Oh, I smell it from here.  Jesus, fuck. 
[03:26:00]  Yeah, you know.  Jeez, man.  Why do you let it pull up in there?  Well, you know, last night, things got out of hand.  Fuck.  I would have rather talk about that than this crap.  Yikes.  So, uh...  All right.  I'm number one.  Troy's number two.  Why is Troy number two?  Well, that remains to be seen.  Sam.  Well, Troy is number two, but I was just hoping it would stretch for time, because Troy likes  to fly off the handle, but...  And that makes...  Number one is Opie.  And he just called Troy number two, which is his way of saying Troy is... 
[03:26:30]  Shit.  He is a piece of shit, right?  He is a piece of shit.  That's your interpretation.  I'm number one again.  That's not what I said.  Shocking.  Troy?  Wow.  You're a piece of shit.  You're a rock size.  Number two.  Only person he hates more than you right now is Opie.  Shocking.  I don't even know how I'm...  Number two.  You should be way up the list.  Roland should be way up the fucking list.  He's right behind you.  Roland is the one that texted me and said, I wonder what Troy thinks.  That is true.  Rock starts so much trouble.  All right.  Can we go home now?  Where's our agent?  Isn't he here today?  Yeah.  He's outside.  He's outside.  Outside where? 
[03:27:00]  I'll help me from the ledge.  Well, this is back in a good mood.  Thanks to E-Rock.  All right.  Anybody want to apologize to E-Rock who's on the list?  I will say that even though I'm low on the list, anything I've done to offend you, I'm  very sorry for it today.  You're not, but I'll accept that apology.  Thank you.  I want to say anything.  Look, I don't even have...  Don't even...  Don't even...  Don't even...  Don't even offend you. 
[03:27:30]  I will...  He apologizes.  I will apologize because you do look upset, but all I was trying to do was avoid this whole  thing.  That's...  That's...  But you're over it, right?  We're good?  Yeah, I'm good.  I'm just glad choice number two.  He was the first one saying...  I'm sorry for not doing anything.  Roland?  I'm just happy choice number two.  He called it.  And Roland?  You have moved up the friend list today.  Oh, E-Rock moved down?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, no.  Way down.  Down on the friend list.  Way down.  And tomorrow's no donuts.  It was...  Oh, shit.  All right.  Fuck that place.  Don't donuts. 
[03:28:00]  I'm going home.  Stupid.  You going home?  I'm out of here.  You guys had a great show.  I told you it'd be good.  Yeah, what else is new?  Right now.  They take us to granted.  Great show.  No shit.  Yeah.  Where's stupid Bob?  He was pissed.  I really thought we'd get to Thursday before I brought that shit up.  I know.  Oh, there's Bob.  By the way...  We were dragging. 
[03:28:30]  Over the weekend, it was...  This won't come up on the air.  Shh.  What's up, V-Rock?  E to the rock.  I'm out.  He will rock you.  He will roll you.  Baby, don't you know?  My heat will move your soul. 
[03:29:00]  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.  Love me today.  Love me tomorrow.  All day, all night.  You feel my heat.  Feel, feel, feel, feel my heat.  I think we should repeat that again. 
[03:29:30]  Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, feel.  Feel my heat.  Feel my heat.  Yeah.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Sirius XM. </pre>
