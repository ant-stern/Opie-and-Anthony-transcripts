<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a raucous discussion of the Bill Clinton-Monica Lewinsky scandal. Opie and Anthony employed crude and sexually explicit humor, detailing their impressions of the affair, the infamous dress, and even engaging in humorous role-playing of conversations between Clinton, Lewinsky, and related individuals.  New photos and videos surfacing of the pair were also a topic of conversation, fueling further sexually explicit jokes. Listeners called in to dedicate songs to Clinton and Lewinsky, creating a comedic musical montage.

The tone shifted somewhat with a discussion of the recent deaths of several children's television personalities, focusing on Shari Lewis, the creator of Lamb Chop.  Speculation arose regarding a supposed "curse" affecting ventriloquists.  This led to a comedic, albeit vulgar, faux-interview with Lamb Chop, where the puppet character unleashed a tirade of bitter and profane comments directed at Shari Lewis.

Opie then shared details of his personal life, revealing his chaotic living situation: paying rent on two apartments while residing on his brother's couch.  He recounted a humorous anecdote about receiving a telemarketing call shortly after setting up a new phone line.  Announcements followed, promoting upcoming musical guests for the show's "Imaginary Ballroom" segment: Third Eye Blind, Semisonic, and Fastball.  The broadcast concluded with a listener prank call segment, featuring a daughter calling her mother in Montana, pretending to be working in the pornography industry.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And my new place doesn't have a bed.  Sleeps on the floor.  So I'm actually staying at my brother's house.  So here it is.  I'm paying rent at two places.  And you're not staying in either one?  Either one of them.  Bravo, good job.  Yeah, not bad, huh?  You're a mess.  I am a mess.  I need a secretary to figure all this out.  All right, but I'm in a good mood.  We're right around.  We're going to talk about Shari Lewis in a little while.  I can't believe this happened.  What is going on?  All these kids show ventriloquists. 
[00:00:30]  They're dropping dead.  We had Bob McAllister from Wonderama.  And Buffalo Bob Smith from Howdy Doody.  And now...  Shari Lewis.  Yeah, Shari Lewis.  The creator of Lamb Chop is dead at 65 of pneumonia.  They all die in threes.  I'm telling you, we brought this up weeks ago on the show.  This is a weird one, though.  Three, you know...  Ventriloquist kiddie show people.  Thank you.  I've died in the last two weeks.  That's amazing.  So we'll get into that a bit.  And if you got something, 212-757-1027. 
[00:01:00]  Fax line 212-957-WNEW.  And the instant feedback all set and ready to go?  Yes, it is.  WNEW.com.  All right.  Go with that.  This is not what I'm used to.  1-0-2-7-WNEW.  The Rock of New York.  Third Eye Blind and Jumper from the band from San Francisco.  And one of the bands that played in the Imaginary Ballroom thus far on the Opie and Anthony show.  This week, is it true?  We're going to have Semisonic in the Imaginary Ballroom?  That's what I'm hearing.  And possibly Fastball? 
[00:01:30]  Are these bands confirmed?  I do believe they are for later this week.  So...  Imaginary Ballroom.  Something to look forward to.  Anybody get any on them?  Out in the Hamptons this weekend?  Any of you ladies get any on you?  I guess Bill's leaving.  He's gone.  Yeah.  He's out of there.  His little weekend fun is over.  He hung out with his Hollywood hotshot friends, raising money, using tax dollars to get there  to the Hamptons to hang out with his friends and raise money for the Democratic Party. 
[00:02:00]  Yes.  Isn't that great?  It's lovely.  Isn't that a great system?  It's a great country we live in.  And Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger hosted him one of those nights.  What was going on in that household?  Is Alec out of his mind?  He's a mess.  He must have been with her every second.  Right.  Yeah.  I'm going to go into the kitchen and get something, honey.  Oh, I'll go with you.  Like just staying by your side 24 hours a day. 
[00:02:30]  I'm just going to go take the garbage out of you.  Oh, no.  Honey.  Kim.  Kim.  Kim, where are you?  Oh, your eyes are.  Where's Bill?  Yeah.  You know, I saw him downstairs.  You know, it's got to be in the back of Alec's mind.  Of course.  The whole weekend.  Yeah.  What's he doing down there?  Yeah.  He's the president of the United States, but he left some of his presidential's on another  woman's dress.  Hey, Kim, could you come over here a minute?  I got something I want to ask you about this little thing I'm looking at on the table.  What, Bill?  What?  I can help you with it. 
[00:03:00]  Right.  I know just as much.  No, Kim, you stay there.  I'll take care of Bill.  You've got to just be petrified.  He'd be like a horny dog or a goat jumping on anything around you.  How true, how true, how true.  And Spielberg, you stayed with him and Kate Capshaw.  Mm-hmm.  It's another one.  You brought up something really funny on Friday with that whole thing.  What was that?  With the blue screen and the...  Well, if he catches them, you know.  Yeah.  Honey, what...  Oh, my God!  Kate!  Bill, get off her! 
[00:03:30]  What's the matter, Steven?  Would this look better if it was filmed in front of a blue screen?  You could just add in your own background.  You could have the making of me doing your wife.  Before the actual feature.  He's just everywhere.  I mean, he's on the cover of all the papers.  And all you think of when you see him is...  He's a horny old goat.  He sure is.  What's going to happen with this, you think?  What, in your mind, Ant, is going to happen? 
[00:04:00]  Well, I don't know.  When Ken Starr, you know, releases this report.  The guy is a slippery guy.  So, it's really up in the air.  But, um...  I think he'll just continue to lie and deny.  Ah, I think he's got to admit at this point.  No, he doesn't have to do anything.  He'll just...  Unless they...  See, if he lies, though, and they find out that...  DNA?  The DNA matches up.  He is done as the President of the United States.  And the patch of presidential porridge left on her dress.  Yeah.  I think he has to go in front of America and admit that... 
[00:04:30]  I have sinned against you, Martin.  Exactly.  You think so?  Nah.  I think he has to.  He can't take the chance that the DNA is going to match up.  That all depends on what comes out when she testifies  and when the FBI gets back that test of the dress.  That's another thing, too.  The FBI, like, he can't just make some fun calls.  Hey, that dress, lose it.  No.  Just lose it.  No.  Just send it to the cleaners.  Right.  Oops.  It'll get sent out to the cleaners or something. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  The next two weeks are going to be very, very interesting to say.  We will see.  All right.  On the way, we've got some Steely Dan, Genesis.  Phones ringing like crazy.  We'll go to those next as well.  Stay there.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW.  Steely Dan.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Beautiful day today.  Beautiful weekend, matter of fact.  Yes.  Got to love that.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, I was mentioning earlier, so I moved into the new place, right?  Yeah.  Well, let's get the facts straight again.  I'm still paying for my apartment in Boston. 
[00:05:30]  Right.  I'm paying for a place in New York, and I'm not living in either one of them.  Brilliant.  I'm on my brother's couch.  You're a brilliant man.  Thank you.  But I got the phone hooked up in my new place.  Right.  Okay.  And I'm unpacking bags and stuff and boxes and trying to get the new place going.  And the phone has been hooked up for two and a half hours, let's say.  Maybe even less.  Mm-hmm.  Do you have my phone number, Anthony?  No, I don't.  Does the boss at NEW have my new phone number, Anthony? 
[00:06:00]  Probably not.  Does my mom, who lives down the street, have my new phone number, Anthony?  I would gather no.  Okay.  Does my girlfriend have my new phone number?  Yeah, well, she's got mine to be.  I, I, no.  Of course.  Of course.  No one has it, because they just installed the phone.  Mm-hmm.  Why is the phone ringing then?  I don't know.  Who wasn't?  The phone was hooked up for an hour, hour and a half, maybe two hours.  The phone rings.  Mm-hmm.  It's a telemarketer. 
[00:06:30]  How did they get my number so fast?  I haven't even given it out yet.  They do get them fast, man.  It's ringing.  I'm like, I'm figuring it's the phone company.  They screwed up something.  No, it's a telemarketer trying to sell me stuff.  Oh.  What were they selling you?  I taped it.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  What were they selling?  I don't know.  Cabinets or something?  Cabinets?  I'm renting.  I, I have no need for cabinets.  Oh.  So I'm like, this is too good, so I push record on my answering machine. 
[00:07:00]  Would you like to hear this?  Yeah, let me hear.  All right.  Hi, Mr.  Yes.  Hi, sir.  My name is April, and I'm calling from Century 21 Cabinet Refacing.  And the purpose of my call is to tell you about a service that we're providing for homeowners  in a wide-to-lea area.  Mr.  Do you own your home?  Yes, I do.  You do?  And this is in my statistics, am I correct?  Yeah.  Yes, sir.  Okay.  Mr.  Um, I'm kind of in the middle of my job right now. 
[00:07:30]  Okay.  No problem, sir.  Um, I'm a college student.  I'm trying to make some extra money on the side.  Oh, me too.  Are you?  Yeah.  What, what do you do?  I'm telemarketing, sir.  Oh.  I, I, uh, this is kind of embarrassing, but I, I donate to a sperm bank.  Oh, okay.  Well, I'll call you back.  Yeah, I'm kind of in the middle of it.  I appreciate it.  Okay, thank you.  A hundred dollars a whack, which is pretty nice.  Okay.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  All right. 
[00:08:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Oh, man.  1027-WNAW, The Rock of New York, Van Halen, Dance the Night Away.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Sing it, Dave.  I'm laughing because, uh, the front page of the post.  Yeah, they found some new pictures.  New videos of President, uh, Clinton and Monica Lewinsky together.  Look at her.  I know.  Oh.  What a pig.  No.  Here she is.  Yeah, mooing at him.  Look at her.  She's, in picture number one, if you turn to your, uh, New York Post workbooks here. 
[00:08:30]  Okay.  Uh, picture number one shows her with her mouth agape.  Uh, a pose I think Clinton's pretty familiar with.  Then, uh, picture two, Clinton drapes his arm over Lewinsky's upper back.  Yeah.  Something tells me he's done that a few times also.  To shake someone's hand.  Uh-huh.  Picture three.  Caught between the crowd and the Commander-in-Chief, a glowing Lewinsky gazes into his eyes.  Mmm.  Ugh. 
[00:09:00]  What a mess.  And then, uh, he gives her a little hug.  Right.  And tries to move on down the crowd.  Mm-hmm.  But she just won't leave him alone.  Now she's staring at him, and then he puts his hand on her shoulder.  Trying to push her down.  It's just the look of love.  Come on.  The look of love.  That's not the look of love.  What's that on your lip?  What a mess.  He's so guilty it's not even funny. 
[00:09:30]  That first picture's great.  Ah.  Her wanting.  Her yearning.  Ma.  Her crawl.  And you mentioned this Friday, I think.  The newspapers are very creative with their headlines.  Yeah.  Here's one.  It's so long.  Island for Bill.  It's so long.  And they put commas in between on purpose, so you'd have to say, it's so long.  Island for Bill. 
[00:10:00]  And then, heads home from Gideon Hampton.  Head.  You said head.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, that's great.  Very nice.  All right.  You got the new videos of the Prez and Monica.  You got that dress.  That foul dress.  Yeah, she supposedly turned over her little dress that she was wearing the night she paid  visit to Bill.  And some of his DNA could be on the dress.  This is our president, right?  We're talking about?  We're talking about the leader of the free world. 
[00:10:30]  This isn't the guy that got caught for doing some peeping today.  No, no.  That guy's funny, too.  But it's the president of the United States.  Okay.  Just want to make sure.  Mm-hmm.  What a mess.  Can you imagine if, you know, the president had other dresses in the White House that he  needed cleaned?  I wouldn't be surprised if he does.  Like, he should.  He probably does.  Look at them stashed all over the White House.  And he'd have to call the laundromats and see if they could get those nasty stains out.  Get those stains out, man. 
[00:11:00]  I wonder what that phone call would sound like.  Hmm.  Hello?  Hello?  Who is it?  Hi, my name's Bill.  And I have a problem with a stain on a dress.  I'd like to know if you could get a stain out of a dress.  Excuse me.  What is it?  I have a stain on a dress that I'd like to know if can be dry cleaned out.  It's a big splooge stain.  You have to bring over to us.  I don't know.  You don't know if you could get a splooge stain out?  What kind of stain? 
[00:11:30]  It's splooge.  It's a big old splooge stain.  And it could get me in a lot of trouble.  And I just want to know if you could get that out.  I don't know.  You don't know?  Because the stain out, I don't know.  You have to see how it is.  Well, I'll let you know.  It's on a black cocktail dress.  And it's right on the front, right underneath where the chin would be.  I don't know.  And it's a big old splooge stain.  It's bigger than the...  You don't know.  It kind of dripped out.  I kind of missed it.  Yeah, it's a big old splooge.  What do you use to get splooge out? 
[00:12:00]  What kind of chemicals best use for splooge?  I heard that commercial, protein gets out protein.  Shouldn't that wash itself out there?  I don't understand what you say.  I don't understand.  It's splooge.  I don't understand.  You know splooge?  I don't understand.  Yankee cranky.  When you're Yankee cranky.  I don't understand too much English.  Okay.  When you Yankee, the cranky.  What are your thoughts on the Opie and Anthony show?  They suck. 
[00:12:30]  Blow them up.  We should hang them.  Oh, we're having fun today.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW.  What the hell?  Another song from Monica Lewinsky.  1027 WNEW, where rock lives.  It's Opie and Anthony.  I just can't get over the dress that everyone's talking about.  The dress.  Did you realize where the dress came from? 
[00:13:00]  Where?  Monica Lewinsky got the dress from The Gap.  She shopped at The Gap.  She shopped at The Gap, got this lovely little cocktail dress.  She should never do an endorsement.  Yes, of course she should.  And the president fouled the dress, and we all know what else is going on.  But the interesting thing is, first of all, The Gap doesn't sell this dress anymore.  Why?  I don't know.  You could get it in the retail shops.  With her, it probably took too much material.  She used up all the material for it.  That cow-like physique. 
[00:13:30]  But this is how weird our country is.  Because Monica bought this dress from The Gap, and the president fouled it, everybody wants this dress.  That's the way it works on this country.  A ton of women out there want this dress.  Remember a few years back, Sharon Stone wore the Black Gap t-shirt to the Oscars, I guess, right?  Mm-hmm.  Just because she wore a black t-shirt to the Oscars.  Everyone wanted it.  Yeah.  They couldn't keep them on the shelves at The Gap.  Same thing is happening with the Monica Lewinsky dress.  They're calling the stores like crazy, and they can't get the damn dress. 
[00:14:00]  So they went like a factory-installed stain, or like pre-stained, you know, like pre-washed denim and stuff.  I want it just like Monica's with the presidential patch of porridge.  I've never heard it called that.  That's pretty good, actually.  Yeah, she's definitely gone through a makeover, too.  You see her?  Yes.  Nowadays, every day, she's in the paper, and she looks, well, she's trying to look just a little better. 
[00:14:30]  Well, they're talking about that in the papers today, too.  All the women want the Monica Lewinsky hairdo.  They want the Monica Lewinsky makeover, basically.  The look?  Okay, we'll start with 20 boxes of Twinkies in one sitting.  Yeah, isn't the Monica look, the Rosie O'Donnell look?  It's the same look, right?  Yeah.  Pretty much.  It's the same damn look.  Just update a little bit with a little of the porridge.  Jeez, a little, that pudge look.  But she's trying, like that other one. 
[00:15:00]  What's her name?  Paula Jones?  Paula Jones chopped her nose off to try to look better.  They should send some of that nose over to the starving.  Somalia or somewhere.  Very nice.  So, there you go.  All right.  Pretty interesting.  We'll see what happens.  Hey, if you got an angle on this Bill and Monica thing, we'd love to hear from you today.  Or you could use the instant feedback through the WNEW website.  Just click on our pictures, and you can shoot us a letter right to the studio immediately. 
[00:15:30]  We'll read it on the air, give you credit for it, right?  Yeah.  And if you want to fax, it's 212-957-WNEW.  1027-WNEW.  The Rock of New York.  The Bryan Central Orchestra recorded live in the Imaginary Ballroom.  Jump, jive, and whale.  We got a few performers coming into the Imaginary Ballroom this week.  Yeah.  I believe on Thursday, it'll be Semisonic doing Closing Time and a couple other ditties.  And then Friday, the song of the summer, I do believe.  Fastball, the way?  Yes.  They're coming in.  That's cool.  To play in the Imaginary Ballroom. 
[00:16:00]  Hear that?  On the Opie and Anthony show.  That is so freaking cool.  All right?  Good.  The listeners are onto something here.  I like this.  We were talking about, actually, we were coming out of Bad Company, Feel Like Making Love,  and we sent that song out to Monica Lewinsky.  And the listeners are calling up with requests for Bill and Monica.  They're pretty funny, actually.  Someone called in for ACDC, Shoot to Throw.  Shoot to Stain.  And who was that guy that we just talked to? 
[00:16:30]  I forgot his name.  I'm sorry.  I apologize, because he came up with a great song, too.  David Bowie, Rebel Rebel.  Yeah.  Put on your dress.  Your face is a mask.  A mask and all that.  Very good.  So if you want to add to the list of songs for Monica and Bill, you could do that by giving  us a call, 212-757-1027.  You could fax them in to us, 212-957-WNEW.  Or you could use the instant feedback, right?  And maybe we'll play just a little bit of each song and put a little montage together 
[00:17:00]  for Bill and Monica.  Sure.  Sounds like a plan, huh?  All right.  Also on the way, we got the Talking Heads and the Goo Goo Dolls with that song that everyone  loves, Iris.  Next.  Stay there.  All right.  We're building our Bill and Monica music montage.  If you got a song you want to dedicate to the lovely couple, give us a call, 212-757-1027.  Here's the Goo Goo Dolls, Iris, on the rock of New York.  1-0-2-7-WNEW.  1-0-2-7-WNEW. 
[00:17:30]  The rock of New York.  Johnny Lang, Lie to Me.  One of the songs he did in the Imaginary Ballroom last week.  He was absolutely great for us last week.  The kid rocks.  He did rock.  And he put on a great show with Buddy Guy.  It's hard to believe he's 17 years old.  So this week in the Imaginary Ballroom, don't forget, we're going to get Semisonic to play  Closing Time and a few other ditties.  Yeah.  And also Fastball coming in Friday to do The Way.  So that's something to look forward to here on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:18:00]  The song of the summer.  That's right.  The Way?  Yeah, I would think.  I think so, too.  No other songs really stand out this summer.  It's the song of the summer.  The song you hear everywhere.  The one that gets stuck in your head.  Yeah, when you're, you know, tolling around the beach, no matter what station it's on,  you hear that same song coming through the radio.  It happens every year.  There's always one that crosses over to many, many different stations.  I think maybe Fastball is one of them.  Yeah.  All right.  Sophie and Anthony, do we have an exclusive interview with Lamb Chop coming up in a little  while, Anthony?  Well.  Is that possible? 
[00:18:30]  Yes, Sophie.  I think I'm trying to line that up now.  Sherry Lewis.  Okay.  Of course, the creator and puppeteer who created Lamb Chop.  The Little Sock Puppet is dead.  That's 65 years old.  That's the, Bob McAllister, who did Wonderama.  He was a ventriloquist and puppeteer.  Dead.  And Buffalo Bob with Howdy Doody.  Dead.  And now, um, Sherry Lewis.  Dead.  The trifecta.  Celebrity.  The triple came out. 
[00:19:00]  I'm telling you, celebrities die in three.  But that's like three in the same industry and everything.  Same group.  Kids shows, same group.  Ooh.  A little creepy conspiracy, maybe.  And what did that guy write on the instant, uh, email?  Oh, which one?  He just knows our show already.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Someone already said, hey.  Hey, guys.  Yeah.  Sherry Lewis, dead of cancer.  I guess he's waiting.  He's waiting for the musical tribute that you did with...  Waiting to see our tribute.  ...Pom McAllister and...  ...and Buffalo Bob. 
[00:19:30]  No, I think we're just going to go with the interview.  The interview with Lamb Chop on the way.  Lamb Chop, yeah.  We're trying to get Lamb Chop on the phone.  Oh, I don't think, uh, anyone else in town has the exclusive interview with Lamb Chop.  Hell no.  Hell no is right.  Just here.  They're too busy doing knuckleheads in the news and all those other wacky radio bits.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, ho.  That's Zini.  Hey.  Wow.  Hey, did you hear the one?  That's Wack-Zin-erific.  Here's a wacky story coming out of Tampa Bay, Florida, everyone.  Can you believe it?  Hey, ho.  A guy put a rocket motor on his car. 
[00:20:00]  And he drove into a brick wall.  Oh, that's insane.  That's wack-o-ricious.  Jesus.  So, stick around for our exclusive interview with Lamb Chop.  Also, the listeners are getting involved.  Actually, they pretty much created this bit, which is pretty cool.  We've been talking about Monica and Bill off and on throughout the afternoon here.  And people started requesting songs for Bill and Monica.  And we're putting together a little montage of songs for the cute little couple.  Yeah. 
[00:20:30]  Cute, cozy couple.  You want to hear what we got thus far?  What do you got?  Hi, N.E.W., do you have a song for Bill and Monica?  Yeah, Pearl Necklace by ZZ Top.  Yeah.  It's perfect.

[00:22:30]  Huh.  Matt from Manhattan.  I think your references to Sherry Lewis' death is tasteless.  You're rude, crass, and obnoxious.  And I'm glad to know that I have someone to listen to from 3 to 7.  That's pretty cool.  We didn't even say anything.  All we did, really, was report on it.  Yeah, actually, we're trying to get Lamb Chop on the phone for the exclusive interview.  Of course, popular puppeteer Sherry Lewis, who won a dozen Emmys and a Peabody for children's  programming in the 60s, died Sunday night of pneumonia while being treated at a Cedars-Sinai 
[00:23:00]  hospital.  She was 65.  Sherry Lewis, of course, had her little sock puppet, Lamb Chop.  And, of course, Charlie Horse.  You might remember Charlie Horse was another puppet who never really got top billing.  No, not as popular as Lamb Chop.  Right.  And everywhere she went, she had the puppet.  Yeah.  Everywhere.  Wasn't Lamb Chop just a sock?  Yeah.  That's what it was.  A sock puppet.  Like you used to make when you were a kid.  I know, but it was just a sock.  Yeah, that's a...  Right?  Yeah.  Just a sock. 
[00:23:30]  Just a sock.  Had some yarn on it and stuff.  Right.  Kind of a dittied up, but it was a sock.  All right.  Well, we got our exclusive interview with Lamb Chop now that, you know...  All right.  Was Lamb Chop a girl or guy?  I don't know.  Lamb Chop.  Lamb Chop.  Interesting.  I think it was a guy.  It must be a guy.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  Just had to make sure.  Okay.  So, Lamb Chop, now that his owner has passed along, we got the exclusive interview here  at N.E.W.  Hello, Lamb Chop.  I'm free.  I'm free at last. 
[00:24:00]  Free at last.  Thank God Almighty.  I'm free at last.  Wait a minute.  What are you talking about?  I thought you liked Sherry Lewis.  Well done.  The witch is dead.  What do you mean by that?  Thank God.  Why do you sound so bitter?  She gave you your break in showbiz.  You'd be bitter, too, if you had to hand up your ass for 20 years.  She wouldn't even take me off when she went to the bathroom, if you catch my drift.  Ah, come on.  And then she thought it was cute, calling me fucking Lamb Chop.  It's like calling a cow Meatloaf, sadistic bitch. 
[00:24:30]  I was the whole act, and she knew it.  We hated each other.  She sucked.  Oh, she's real creative.  I haven't listened to that shit for 20 years.  Creative?  I'm a fucking shock.  But then she didn't have a condom in her hand when she thought me up.  Things would look a little different.  Hey, her fucking lips move when she's dark.  What kind of crap is that?  It's about to be a ventriloquist.  Your mouth is moving like Monica Lewinsky. 
[00:25:00]  I'm a 45-cent sock from Woolworths that she made a fucking fortune off of, and I didn't get kicked.  Lamb Chop, what's in your future?  I'm going to be in a couple of new films.  Yeah?  That Lamb Chop sucks a big dick.  And shove your fist in my ass.  And my career's flying, that fucking bitch.  All right, Lamb Chop, I better let you go mourn some more. 
[00:25:30]  All right, bye-bye, kids.  Bye.  All right, it's Lamb Chop, everyone.  Opie and Anthony.  1027.  1027 WNEW, the rock of New York, Creed, and my own prison.  In excess before that, it's Opie and Anthony.  The phone's going absolutely crazy here.  Everyone wants to come up with a little song for Monica and Bill.  Well, everyone is talking about the dress and the, and the, and the, and the, and the stain. 
[00:26:00]  The stain, thank you.  The most famous stain since the blood stains on OJ's driveway.  There's a stain on Monica's dress.  This is the most famous presidential stain since JFK.  Oh, since, since Jackie's dress.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  What a coincidence.  Another dress is involved.  Another dress stained by the president.  Right.  Oh, my God.  It was a different type of shot. 
[00:26:30]  Out of a different head.  Ouch.  Sorry.  We couldn't resist that.  We always have to end up way down here.  And we do apologize.  We can't help ourselves sometimes.  We're trying to control ourselves.  Ah.  God damn, that's funny, though, man.  Oh, my God.  Anyway, everyone's calling up with songs that they want to dedicate to the president  and Monica Lewicki.  It's a dedication. 
[00:27:00]  That's right.  What songs do you want to request?  Right.  And we've added to our montage, so we got the first part of the montage we played a little  while ago, and then we got some new ones at the end, so check this out, huh?  Hi, Andy W., do you have a song for Bill and Monica?  Yeah, Pearl Necklace by ZZ Top.  Yeah.  That's perfect.  A pearl necklace.  A pearl necklace.  Billy from Queens has one.  ACDC, Shoot to Thrill.  Hi, do you have a song for Bill and Monica? 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, but Pat Benatar, say, hit me with your best shot.  Yeah.  Hi, what do you got for Bill and Monica?  Oh, I think I was Miss Bill's big ten inch would be just right. 
[00:28:00]  Hi, who's this?  This is Paul from Cranford.  All right, Paul, you got a song for the cute couple?  Yeah, the Lemon Song from Led Zeppelin.  Say no more, say no more.  Hi, Andy W., do you have a song for the Prez and his lovely little girlfriend? 
[00:28:30]  Yes, I do, Fat Bottom Girls.  Oh, you're gonna let it all hang out, Fat Bottom Girls.  You make the rockin' world go round.  Hi, do you have a song for the Prez?  Yes, I do. 
[00:29:00]  Let's hear it.  I, The Cars, and Tonight She Comes.  I know tonight, she comes.  Hi, do you have a song for the lovely couple?  Oh, I got a perfect song for Monica Bluinski.  All right.  How about Suck My Kiss from the Red Hot Chili Peppers?  Yeah. 
[00:29:30]  Came in a little early there, sorry about that.  It's Hopi and Anthony.  Hope you're enjoying the festivities today.  We're in a really good mood for a Monday.  I don't know what happened.  I think it's the boss, you know, whipping us into shape because, I don't know if anyone  else noticed, but on Mondays, we really, we're not that good.  Yeah, maybe we should just have a formal blanket apology for every Monday we've done so far.  Well, we have to apologize for a lot of our bad shows.  On Mondays, we have really, really bad shows, usually, but not today, thank God. 
[00:30:00]  And every time our stock goes down, we have really, really bad shows as well.  The Dow down today, big, but for some reason, when the Dow goes down, our stock goes up.  Yeah.  So I think between both of us, we might have made somewhere in the realm of eight or nine  bucks today.  Really?  I think so.  That's cool.  No, not made.  That's total worth now.  Okay.  We made about two or three dollars.  And you might have noticed last week we had a lot of bad shows.  Yeah.  The Dow was all over the place and we apologize for that. 
[00:30:30]  Actually, I'm blaming any bad shows we have on the Asian economic crisis because it's  very, for some reason, it's affecting everything over here.  You know something?  Yeah.  Everyone go out tonight and buy sushi because for some reason, Japan is going down the tubes  and a bunch of people are selling off on Wall Street.  Yeah.  It's making me a little nervous.  Of course.  Go out, buy some sushi.  But there you go.  Pump their economy up.  I think that's the deal, though.  Our stock went up today, so we're having a good show.  Okay.  That must be it.  Our show depends on the stock market like everything else in this country lately. 
[00:31:00]  Bill gets a...  And the stock, you know, plummets.  What the hell's going on here?  Okay.  Wow.  Lots of facts is coming in.  How did you guys do that stained skit with the Chinese lady without laughing?  That was hilarious.  I don't know what she's talking about.  That was Bill Clinton.  Bill Clinton.  They want to hear that again.  We'll try to get that before the end of the show.  My friend was away on vacation. 
[00:31:30]  Did not hear the big Willie pop.  Please play that again, Emily.  All right, Emily.  We'll try to get to that.  And this guy wants to dedicate a song to Bill and Monica.  Dedicate Don't Come Around Here.  No more.  Very good.  What are you getting on the instant feedback?  I'm getting from Lake Success.  Can you play a bit from your record which is unavailable in New York?  New York.  It's unavailable everywhere.  Not available in stores near you.  You played a bit from your record last week called Butt Plug. 
[00:32:00]  Yes, we did.  Please play another one today.  Well, all right.  I got the CD here, actually.  Opium Athlete's The Better World.  Don't bother trying to look for it because you can't find it in New York.  Unavailable.  Unavailable everywhere.  I wonder why.  All right, we can play a bit from this.  You want to play Hi, Mom, I'm in Porno?  Yeah, that's kind of cool.  Kind of cool.  This is so brutal.  Giving you another taste of our personality here.  What would the average mom do if her daughter called and told her that she was not doing what 
[00:32:30]  she thought she was doing, but she was in porno movies and really convinced the mother  that she was now went from sweet girl to doing porno.  Yeah.  It's brutal.  This is really brutal to listen to.  And this is how we celebrated Mother's Day at our last radio job.  We had all these girls calling their mothers and breaking bad news to them. 
[00:33:00]  And the other radio stations are, hey, we're going to send some flowers to your mom in your  name.  As our little mother's day dad.  No, we have daughters call up and tell moms they're in porno.  So this is Hi, Mom, I'm in Porno off Hopi and Anthony's The Better World CD where you  can't find anywhere.  Hold on to your hats.  Hi, Michelle.  You want to play Hi, Mom?  Yes, I do.  All right.  I hear you want to play Hi, Mom, I'm in Porno.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Awesome.  Now, where does your mom live?  Montana.  Well, what are you doing in Boston?  I'm a nanny. 
[00:33:30]  You're a nanny.  Yes.  Maybe you could tell your mom you lost your job as a nanny and you had to make ends  meet so you jumped into porno.  Okay.  All right.  I got your mom's number.  I'm giving her the call right now.  Okay.  Nutrition Center.  Hi, can I speak to Jean, please?  Is this Michelle?  Yes, it is.  It's important.  Okay.  Hold on, hon.  Uh-huh.  Now, play it up.  Say you lost your job.  You had no other choice.  Okay.  You were all alone.  Hello?  Mom?  Yes?  I have a problem.  I lost my job.  Why? 
[00:34:00]  Because I just wasn't doing it.  I couldn't cope with it, you know.  I thought you said it was going great.  It was, but things just fell apart.  I'm having a really hard time, so I didn't tell you sooner because I was too scared to,  but I know I got a different job, but I'm doing...  I don't know how to tell you this.  What?  I'm doing porn movies.  No.  Yes?  No.  Mom?  No.  What?  It's too late.  No.  Mom?  No. 
[00:34:30]  No.  Um, I'll...  You, hold on.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Holy Jesus.  I think she believes you.  I'm shaking.  Michelle?  Yeah?  Where can I reach you?  Um, I have...  I have, like, three days to get out of here, so I...  You don't do that.  What?  Don't do what you told me.  Well, what am I going to do?  How am I going to get home?  You don't have money in the bank?  Well, yeah, but I kind of had to use some of it to get this rolling. 
[00:35:00]  I had to get an agent...  No, you don't.  Where can I call you?  The same number, but, Mom...  What?  There's something else I have to tell you.  Happy Mother's Day.  I love you.  This is just a joke.  I'm on the radio.  Oh, my God.  It's a radio program.  Oh.  I just wanted to let you know that I love you.  Oh, my God.  I'm thinking about you.  Mom?  You know, I think those things are so funny when they happen to other people.  I mean, I would sit and listen to them all day long because they're so funny, but that... 
[00:35:30]  You killed me.  Oh, my God.  There you have it.  Yeah, that always makes me laugh.  She was just crutched.  There you go.  Hi, Mom.  I'm in Pornham.  No wonder this CD of ours isn't available anywhere.  Just conjured up that mental picture in her head of her little girl.  Well, you know, I came up with a new idea that I want to pull off.  What?  I want some guy to call his wife and tell him that he lost his wedding ring at the strip club. 
[00:36:00]  Mmm.  Oh, that's a good one.  That's a pretty good one.  Hi, honey.  I lost my wedding ring.  At a strip club.  At a strip club.  Right.  Maybe we can make that happen.  All right.  On the way, we got some Sheryl Crow and Dire Straits and whatever you want to do.  Give us a call.  Save your beer soul.  Sam Adams.  A better glass of beer.  It's like my great-grandfather used to say,  if you have kegs of beer at your house, you're going to get laid. 
[00:36:30]  I'm Buddy Jim Cuxley.  Yeah, we've got to get him on the radio.  We've had him on in the past.  That guy is a blast.  Went to the Caribbean with him.  Yeah, he has the best drinking stories ever, ever, ever, ever.  Some on the beach at like 8 in the morning.  Yeah.  He's got a Sam Adams in it.  Yeah.  A better glass of beer.  We've got to get back to the music.  Yeah.  1027 WNEW, where rock lives.  It's Opie.  It's Anthony.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey. 
[00:37:00]  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, stop that now.  Cut it out.  I don't know.  Do you want to play the cleaner thing again?  The cleaner.  Well, people are requesting it.  Well, yeah.  Okay.  Bill Clinton has a problem with stained dresses, I guess.  Well, everyone's talking about Monica's dress.  Yeah.  And earlier in the show, we were just wondering, you know, if the president has more dresses  that are fouled in the White House.  And maybe he wants to get them cleaned, you know, so the evidence isn't there. 
[00:37:30]  And he would have to call it cleaners.  Hmm.  Would he?  And he would have to discuss how to get the stains out of the dresses.  And we were just wondering how that would sound.  Hmm.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York.  Pretty big buzz on this guy.  Hmm.  Sean Mullins, Lullaby, guy from Georgia.  His CD's called Soul's Core.  And you can't find it in New York yet.  But you will in the near future, because he was on a small label.  But I do believe one of the major labels just picked him up. 
[00:38:00]  And they'll be distributing that CD in New York soon.  Well, good.  Very good.  Mm-hmm.  And we're pretty proud of the fact we were the first station in New York to bring that one to you.  Right.  Oh, go.  You know how we were talking about songs that kind of fit the Bill and Monica thing earlier in the show?  Yeah, we had listeners requesting songs to Bill and Monica.  Sure.  Mm-hmm.  This one's a good one.  Bruce from East Village.  The Weight by the Band.  I think that's got to be one of the best lines for this situation ever. 
[00:38:30]  Ever.  The best line ever.  What would that be, Ed?  This one.  And you put the load right on me.  Hey, that doesn't say it all.  I don't know what does.  Woo!  There you go, honey.  Oh, baby.  Yeah.  Put the load right on me.  There you go.  Oh, my cocktail dress.  Damn you, Bill Clinton. 
[00:39:00]  I'm going to have to clean this.  Or press it like my prom flowers.  That's probably what she did.  Wrapped it all up in plastic.  Ew.  Pulled it out for her friends.  And you know what this is?  The cocktail dress I wore.  See that?  You know what that is?  Yeah, but it's got to be an order of appearance.  She probably has all her dresses lined up.  You know, her communion dress.  Her junior prom dress.  Her senior prom dress.  Working her way out.  And Monica, what's this one? 
[00:39:30]  Oh, it's my cocktail dress.  Remember, Monica, if you go to school and do your homework, someday you'll grow up to do the president.  Do we have to get off the air?  Can we do another hour, Matt?  Come on, man.  Let's hang.  Let's do it.  It's your turn, I guess.  Like Lennox Lewis.  Come on, man.  Let's get it on.  Let's get it on.  Let's get it on.  You don't sound so bad with that British accent, you know?  Come on, man.  Let's get it on.  Let's get it on. 
[00:40:00]  Meantime, we'll knock someone's head across the block.  Yes, what's up?  So, you know, I left something in here last...  I lost something.  I can't find it.  I left it in here last week.  You guys see the month of July?  I know.  Wow, it did go by.  Summer is flying by.  Actually, we had a...  Me and Anthony, while we were driving to Manhattan today, there was a huge sign that the summer is, you know, almost over.  Dunsky, what?  The women are starting to wear more clothes all of a sudden.  What happened to that?  That's no good.  Already.  Already.  It could also be the 64-degree temperatures we've had. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, well, people were bitching about the heat.  No, it's a little cooler, which is nice.  I hear the back-to-school on TV.  Yeah, yeah.  Football commercials.  That...  And, I mean, which is cool, because I look forward to that.  But that's one of the reminders that, like, meant false just around the corner.  I mean, Giants playing the Bengals Saturday.  You could hear it on NAW, 705 Saturday.  But I just...  It doesn't feel right yet.  In a few weeks, it will, obviously.  I know you love people that, like, we're talking about summer, and everyone goes, oh, where 
[00:41:00]  did July go?  But does anyone worry about February?  No, not at all.  The person goes, damn, where's February go?  Where did February go?  I was just getting into...  Eight hours of daylight?  Yeah.  Cold?  You know.  Yeah.  Nothing to say.  That's true.  Before you know it.  Oh.  Don't even go there.  Come on.  It happens.  No, no, no, no.  Because you know how it works with summer, for some reason, when spring rolls around,  it's freezing for months and months.  Even in spring, it's still cold for some reason. 
[00:41:30]  When Labor Day hits, all of a sudden, oh, you're out, you're sunning, the next day, whoosh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That is so weird how that happens.  It just cuts off and it's done.  So appreciate this last month.  We're long out of it, guys.  You know, I used to spend my summers always at the Jersey Shore.  Right.  So, I mean, was it the same, like, the minute, like, the second, the hand-hit midnight?  It's all over.  It was Labor Day.  It's all over.  Boom!  Done.  Everyone just leaves.  Yeah.  There's people down at the Jersey Shore.  They have banners hanging over the overpasses on the parkway. 
[00:42:00]  Bye-bye, Benny.  You know, go home.  Yeah.  All over the place.  And they've had it at that point, so.  I was on the parkway yesterday.  Have you guys seen these extreme bumper stickers?  No.  What are those?  Dude, just, you know, it's just like, everybody's got a cause, or, you know.  And now it's like people cracking on other people's bumper stickers.  And it's like, I just love it.  It says, your child may be an honor student, but you're still an idiot.  I saw three great ones this weekend.  One said, Earth first, we'll strip mine the other planets later. 
[00:42:30]  Very good.  I like that.  Stop repeat offenders.  Don't re-elect them.  Oh.  I mean, you know, there's going to be a little more edge in them.  Yes.  Oh, I love the one.  Ask me about my grandchildren.  Like, I'm going to pull up.  First of all, if I did get the opportunity to come up to your window, and you roll it down,  and me talk to you, it would be about how you drove 10 miles an hour in front of me for 50 miles.  I just ran you into a tree at 60, because I want to talk about your grandkids.  Oh, speaking of traffic, too.  Five more minutes left. 
[00:43:00]  Okay.  If you're on the Queensborough Bridge right now, on the upper level, hang a Yui.  Real quick.  They're changing the pattern in five minutes.  Well, they did.  I know.  The upper level now is going to be regular traffic now.  No way.  But right now, it's just outbound.  Yeah.  How's Charlton Heston going to deal with that?  My God damn them all to hell.  All right.  We got to get out of here.  Yep.  Dunsky.  Hey, Bill, did you want to hear your song one last time?  Huh?  What song?  This song is dedicated to you. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, yeah, please.  Could you?  Ah, yeah.  Ooh.  When you put the loan right on.  The loan right on.  The loan right on.  The loan right on.  The loan right on.  The loan right on.  The loan right on.  The loan right on.  The loan right on.  The loan right on.  The loan right on.  The loan right on.  The loan right on.  The loan right on.  The loan right on.  The loan right on.  The loan right on.  The loan right on.  The loan right on.  The loan right on.  The loan right on.  The loan right on.  The loan right on.  The loan right on.  The loan right on.  The loan right on.
