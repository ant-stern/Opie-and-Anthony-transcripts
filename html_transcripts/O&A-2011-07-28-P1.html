<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton excitedly, yet crudely, discussing their upcoming live show at the Hard Rock Cafe in Times Square.  The event was to feature stand-up performances from SiriusXM employees Sam Roberts, E-Rock, Roland, Travis, and Bobo (who would also sing and perform a one-man band act), as well as a Stalker Patty Amy Winehouse tribute.  The hosts' banter was heavily laden with homophobic slurs, misogynistic remarks, and general profanity,  touching on Bobo's nonsensical tweets, Opie's secret Twitter account, and Sam's perceived career maneuvering.  The conversation jumped between planning for the show, the movie "Change-Up," Mad Dog Sports Radio's Women's World Cup coverage, Roland's impending move, Christopher Walken anecdotes, and Jay Moise's podcast. A false emergency broadcast system alert briefly interrupted the proceedings.

Following a phone call with Jay Moore promoting his podcast (including a story about Bert Kreischer's alleged bear encounter), the discussion shifted to Anthony's plans to see a Fedor Emelianenko fight in Chicago, triggering recollections of past road trips and Anthony's aggressive driving habits. He recounted a near-collision with a Lincoln Town Car, resulting in a furious shouting match.  The hosts discussed road rage, referencing Kenny, and further anecdotes about Anthony's confrontations with other drivers. The conversation returned to the Hard Rock Cafe show, initially giving the wrong address before correcting themselves. They expressed frustration over the unexpectedly high number of RSVPs and the chaotic RSVP process, a sentiment echoed during a studio conversation with comedian Kurt Metzger. They then headed to the Hard Rock Cafe, airing highlights from recent "walkovers," featuring Rich Voss' stand-up, a staged John Cena "nut-kicking" scene, a man-on-the-street interview with John Montone, and other street encounters. Sam Roberts announced the imminent live broadcast from the Hard Rock Cafe.

The live broadcast from the Hard Rock Cafe started with the hosts' usual vulgar humor and banter, commenting on the small initial crowd and their desire for more women in the front row.  A rape joke was told early on, and an 18-year-old woman from a previous show was briefly mentioned. Kurt Metzger was present but not immediately introduced.  The hosts also made derogatory comments about K-Rock.  Big A, noticeably thinner, attempted a news report but struggled intensely with nervousness, resulting in comedic riffing from Opie and Anthony.  The main portion of the show was a staff stand-up competition hosted by Kenny, featuring Roland (whose act was hard to follow), Sam Roberts (who shared a painful circumcision story), Troy Kwan (whose routine focused on "fat chicks"), Danny Ross (who discussed his fear of waking up gay and his dating life), and Stalker Patty's Amy Winehouse tribute. The hosts frequently heckled the performers.  Pat from Munaki briefly discussed the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest, Bobo performed his one-man band act, and a Penthouse Pet was interviewed, leading to an uncomfortable exchange due to the hosts' sexually suggestive comments.  The broadcast concluded with a teaser for a future prostate exam for a staff member by Dr. Steve.

The live broadcast continued with a bizarre segment where Dr. Steve performed a rectal exam on Roland on-air, preceded by a negotiation about the number of guests Roland could book without approval (the agreement settled on three guests over several months).  After the exam, the show featured stand-up from Club Soda Kenny, Travis (detailing his childhood games "Undy Flip" and "Peenie Flip"), and E-Rock (who insulted Sam). Big A delivered a rambling news report about a mass killing in Norway, and Bobo performed another disjointed stand-up set.  A brief interview with Joel McHale from *Community* and a promotion for a future show covering Jim Norton and Sam Roberts' Comic-Con experience concluded this portion.

A later segment focused on Ken, a former general practitioner turned entertainer, who had humorously diagnosed Joe Russo's leg pain as a pulled muscle, contradicting a studio nurse.  They discussed the legal ramifications of such impromptu diagnoses. Ken joined the show, confirming the story and mentioning his "Dr. Ken" stand-up act.  The conversation then shifted to Joel McHale, who discussed *Community*, Michael K. Williams joining the cast, and the lack of awards for *The Wire*.  The majority of this segment covered Jim Norton and Sam Roberts' Comic-Con experience, featuring interviews with the *Wilfred* cast (Elijah Wood, Jason Gann, Fiona Gubelmann), footage of Sam's interactions, Chip Chipperson's crude interviews with attendees, Bruce Campbell promoting his *Burn Notice* spin-off, and Carrie Byron from *Mythbusters*, with emphasis on Danny's admiration for her.

[00:00:30]  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:01:00]  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:01:30]  Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony Show.

[00:02:30]  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:03:00]  Opie and Anthony Show right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:03:30]  What the hell am I doing here?  Isn't it brilliant?  Forget it.  The thing's out of control.  Out of control.  Great guests, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It gets my nipples hard, you know what I mean, son?  Are you out of your mouth?  It's not the most talked about, not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to a show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to answer it.  Oh, you're going to have a ball.  Oh, you're going to have a ball.  Oh, you're going to have a ball.  Yeah, yeah, you're going to have a ball.  America's most trusted name in news, the Opie and Anthony Radio Show. 
[00:04:00]  Let's welcome our hosts, Opie and Anthony.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  By the way.  Who's Jim Norton?  He's right here.  By the way.  You old, doddering old tool.  Hi, Jimmy.  What a drop-off for Larry King.  Ah.  Used to host his own TV show now.  He's introing this fine radio show.  Yeah, by the way.  By the way.  Big day, I guess, huh?  Oh, yes. 
[00:04:30]  I got my daily phone call from Club Soda Kenny.  Oh, right.  To awaken me.  Right.  It's just a treat, a joy.  Right.  To look forward to.  Right.  And when I answer the phone, he was like, big day today.  I was like, oh, yeah, it made me just jump out of bed.  Big day today.  A little spring in your step today.  Ah, just a tad, just a tad.  So he's all in civilian wear.  He's not wearing a suit.  He's wearing his, I'm going to be out in public wear. 
[00:05:00]  Well, it just makes it easier to crack skulls if he has to.  And that's true.  He likes loose-fitting clothes just in case.  He doesn't want to get any brain matter on his suits.  Nah, not at all.  Something my wife can clean easily.  Well, I'm checking Twitter.  There's people standing online already.  Ah.  Where are we going today?  I don't even know.  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  We're going to be at the Hard Rock Cafe right here in Times Square.  Fuck, really?  What time?  8 a.m. is when we'll go on the air. 
[00:05:30]  Who's going to be there?  Obi, Anthony.  Oh, I thought we were going to watch a show.  No, you will actually be hosting.  Oh, wait, we've got to fucking do a show.  Do we have to do something there?  Oh, man.  Oh, fuck, man.  We've got a lot planned for you.  Yeah, what did you guys plan for us?  Yeah, what did you do?  Well, we're trying.  Are we really at this point in our careers?  What did you plan for us?  Because I have no fucking idea.  We have some news from Big A.  Oh, what kind of news from Big A?  Some of the big stories of the summer so far. 
[00:06:00]  Nice.  And what we actually did was we put in some S-T words.  No, yay!  Why would he do that?  You know he has a problem with S-T words.  That's not fair.  From what I know, he can't really pronounce it, so that might be awkward.  Why would...  Shit, I didn't write it, you know, so I don't know what...  Can we numb his tongue today?  I don't see why not.  Just try something different?  Yeah.  Will the lawyers have a problem with that?  Speak better.  Is there something we could do?  Put some ice on it?  I don't know.  Slam it in the door?  Yeah, just stomp on it.  Stomp on it. 
[00:06:30]  Anyone have any illegal Novocaine?  No, I mean, I wish we had prepared better.  We'll also have Stalker Patty there to sing a fitting tribute to Amy Winehouse.  That I can't wait for.  Kurt Mesrick will be there?  Yes.  Wait, wait.  Slow down.  Did I say his name wrong?  Yes.  Kurt Mesrick is if the big creepy comic and the author got together.  Kurt Mesger's a comedian.  Can you go backwards, though?  Is Stalker Patty doing the Amy Winehouse?  I mean, has she been practicing? 
[00:07:00]  Is she ready?  Yes, I believe...  She's been spoken to about it.  She's looking forward to it.  She's really ready for it.  And I think the audience is going to be moved.  They're going to be moved by her rendition of what?  Rehab.  Rehab.  Right out the door.  Everybody out the door or something.  Bobo will be there.  He said we've told him to prepare not only some kind of comedy routine, but also a song  and a one-man band, so we can kind of make that up on the fly.  Has he had a stroke, by the way?  Bobo?  Why?  Why?  What happened? 
[00:07:30]  I read his tweets.  I don't understand what the fuck he's saying.  It's called retardation, idiot.  Is it?  I'm sorry.  I thought it was vertation.  Sorry, sorry.  I didn't mean to say it that way.  I don't care.  I am an idiot.  No, I'm sorry.  No, you're right.  He is.  You couldn't have said a true thing.  Very accurate.  Cocksucker, dummy, all would have been accurate.  I do say those things in a loving way, but sometimes it comes across like being a complete  jerk.  Sorry.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to say it that way.  Radio Bobo XM-105. 
[00:08:00]  XM-105.  A nice easy Twitter name.  Fuck, he has more followers than I do.  You know, no one has found my real Twitter account yet.  Really?  Yeah.  Still?  Yep, still.  Wow.  A secret Twitter account.  No, my real Twitter account.  The one?  Yeah.  OP Radio.  I don't know who's running that fucking thing.  Oh, shit.  They do an okay job, but I got a much better Twitter account than that.  Nobody can find it.  It's okay.  I like it that way.  It's not Radio Bobo XM-105, is it? 
[00:08:30]  No.  No.  Because I think these are coded messages to some terrorist cell, because it's not English.  You mean, I am so drozy, I fell like a zombie right now?  You know what Bobo's tweets are like?  You ever buy something that was obviously made in Japan, and you have to put it together,  and you get the directions, and they must have ran it through a translator, and the words  aren't quite right?  Those are Bobo tweets.  I don't understand it.  There was one where it was a complete bertation. 
[00:09:00]  This was your bertation.  It was, he said, not Sam.  I got in in Thursday.  I got the email, no bedging, to get in from me, OP Radio, Anthony Cumia, Jim Norton.  I totally get it, though.  I saw that, I'm like, what?  I read bertations.  Do you?  Yeah.  Yeah, he's going to the Hard Rock Cafe, and he didn't have to ask anyone to get in.  He did it all himself.  Oh, so it says, I got, I got in on Thursday, period.  Yeah.  I got the email, comma, he sent out an email like everybody else, the company got back 
[00:09:30]  to him and said, you're one of the 400 or whatever the fuck they're going to try to  squeeze in there.  Oh, so he doesn't have to beg.  So he's basically telling you, I got in Thursday, meaning I'm going to be there.  Oh, okay.  I got an email from the company, meaning I didn't have to ask anybody, I did this on  my own.  And the one time he does something on his own, he would have been on the guest list anyway  because we want him to perform.  He's a performer.  Should we bring the chair of honor to the big broadcast, Jim?  I'm sure that'll be easy. 
[00:10:00]  Get the lawyers on the phone.  Can we transport a chair without a problem?  Someone then sits on it at the venue.  We want indemnification that if the chair collapses, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  What else do we have planned for today?  Well, the main event of the evening.  Yes.  Which is at 8 a.m.  That means we should probably leave now.  Because there's so much stuff?  Yes.  You mean go home?  Leave home?  What?  Wait, a question is, can people still get in or no? 
[00:10:30]  Answer.  No, it was RSVP'd and there were far more, like, I think a thousand people emailed in.  And so of those people that RSVP'd, it's first come, first serve.  Sam, are you jealous that we're so damn popular?  It's crazy, right?  No.  It bothers you, doesn't it?  I think you guys deserve it.  It bothers you, right?  Well, I'm a fan first before I'm a worker, so I get it why you're so popular.  You were a lot of things before you were a worker.  When you become a worker, let us know. 
[00:11:00]  You're a burden to creep.  You're a pederast.  Yeah, the main event is at least Sam, E-Rock, and Roland doing stand-up.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Sam, E-Rock, and Roland.  So it's me and then two guys who went to comedians to write their sets.  No, they didn't.  And that's the stand-up comedy showdown?  What about Travis, Danny?  Are they on standby?  Everybody's ready to go.  Everyone's ready to go.  It was already five.  Oh, what about Troy?  Troy's got three minutes that he says will knock your socks off. 
[00:11:30]  All right, so yeah, we've got most of the guys doing stand-up today.  Good.  And I know...  We've got to squeeze a lot in is what's knocking our socks off.  I know Travis has prepared three minutes.  Wow.  And I've heard some of his set.  Great.  Wow, great.  Travis?  Yes.  Now, Travis was being poked at a bit on the after show, the shit hour, which I like to call it.  We were good at after show, but...  Yes, yes.  But we all listen.  He was being poked at that he is...  What was the word called? 
[00:12:00]  It was somethingly unfunny.  Oh, yeah.  I mean...  Whether it was painfully or...  Notoriously, maybe.  Notoriously unfunny.  Like...  Yes, and he took that to heart, and I believe came to what I call the table.  Now, he's...  Wow, he's marching down the hall.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Look out.  Look out.  He's the one staff member who's a father, so his act is a little more family-friendly.  He does have some family-friendly stuff.  What did they call you yesterday?  Was it notoriously unfunny? 
[00:12:30]  Well, why are they calling you notoriously unfunny?  They...  If by they, you mean Sam?  Yes.  I speak for the people.  Well, him being at the helm of the shit hour, he is responsible for other people.  Yes.  So it is a they kind of a vibe.  Although it has turned into what I call the urban hour yesterday.  That was nice.  It was a nice urban radio.  I got one person on Twitter say...  Well, I won't say what he tweeted, but...  Well, I'm sure.  Or was it Anthony Cumia at Twitter? 
[00:13:00]  No, he sounded like a friend of yours.  Who was in?  Who Kid was in.  Stop with the black thing, man.  It has to be related to our show somehow.  Who Kid's been on the show a bunch of times.  I don't even...  I don't know Who Kid.  Who's this Who Kid?  He's trying to get Sway on the show.  Sway.  It's fucking...  I was waiting for you to play a Fitty song.  A Fitty.  Oh, my God.  Well, I mean, you know, we just like to have people who are fellow employees all come in.  It's a family.  Your show's very diverse as opposed to this one.  Well, I try to do some things for everybody. 
[00:13:30]  Don't use the after show to try to develop names that you can throw out on a train if  you're about to get beat up by eight black people.  That's Sway.  Who Kid.  Who Kid, please.  Oh, damn.  You motherfucking Sam.  He uses that hour to audition, I think.  Yeah.  Oh, it's total audition.  Because he so wants out of this organization.  It does.  You want to be working for a black show, right?  Sam.  I'm using Who Kid's show to audition.  Ah.  That's what I'm doing.  Who Kid is the man.  He's got some shit going on.  I know that.  Sometimes you have to return the favor.  All right. 
[00:14:00]  So Travis is doing stand-up.  Well, I've got, you know...  You're prepared, just in case.  I'm prepared if it gets that.  If need be.  Yeah.  A lot of, hey, I'm a dad.  I'm a dad.  Hey, you ever notice this?  Hey, you ever notice that?  Hey, you ever notice this?  Yeah.  You ever notice that?  Yeah.  I'm just doing Seinfeld.  Your comedic...  Oh, yeah.  I was going to ask you.  Your comedic style, is it sort of a Seinfeld thing?  No, it's more long form.  You're a comedian, right?  Long form.  But who would you point to?  Just so people get a visual of what kind of comedy.  I don't know.  Who's the least funny comic out there? 
[00:14:30]  Oh, shit.  Really?  You want to see it?  Don't understand.  You're going to do this all to write down somebody?  You know, it is what it is.  I've never, you know, written anything before, so...  Are you nervous about it or looking forward to it?  Well, I'm certainly not, you know, looking forward to it, but I'm certainly not nervous  about it.  I mean, look, I'm not a standard comedian.  Being a new dad, it's just a lot of different things that happen.  Hey, you guys ever notice diapers?  Just the other day.  You ever notice...  Yeah, you do a lot of that. 
[00:15:00]  You ever notice...  But it's relatable, which is strong.  Yes.  Relatability.  A lot of parents in the crowd that won't have the outlet with the other comedians.  All right.  That is true.  E-Rock and Roland, like, who are they?  Well, E-Rock is patterning his act after Shuley from the Howard Stern show, because that's  who wrote it.  Oh, nice.  Shuley wrote Roland's act?  No, E-Rock's.  E-Rock's act.  Why'd you say that?  Now there's going to be a problem.  What do you mean?  I don't know if Howard wants his people doing anything for us.  Oh, it's already came up on the after show.  I thought E-Rock could have been more of a...  I love Shuley, by the way.  Shuley rules. 
[00:15:30]  A Louis Anderson bit.  Why is that?  I think I'm going to explode if I don't sweat.  Ah, I swallowed a lot of aggression.  You should move the mic out of the way when you stand up, E-Rock goes, so he can see me.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That was funny.  Lily used to do that.  Yeah, really?  You take the mic stand and move it.  Let me move this so he can see me.  What did he move it?  Up his ass?  That's a queen.  I got it.  Right?  I thought I'd reiterate.  Nice.  All right, and who else? 
[00:16:00]  Troy.  Troy, he's developed an act that...  I like his premise.  I haven't heard his act, but I like...  I bet it's in your face.  Well, yeah, and let me tell you something.  Let me tell something to any of the fans out there who are going to be there.  If you start booing Troy when he gets up there, he will be in your face.  Oh, shit.  Why'd you say that?  So he can work the crowd.  Why'd you say that?  Troy Kwan can work the crowd.  What?  Oh, shit.  Troy, go ahead.  He's pissed now. 
[00:16:30]  Shut the fuck up.  What the fuck are you doing?  Oh, damn.  Yeah, go ahead, Troy.  He's just talking out his ass.  He's setting you up to fail.  Of course he is.  Yeah, that's what Sam does.  Of course he does.  Because now everyone's going to boo as soon as Troy hits the stage.  I mean, that's fine.  Whatever.  You just set him up to fail.  Yeah, why are you doing that?  What the fuck, dude?  I didn't.  Yeah, you kind of did.  Troy will be ready to go.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  That's not cool, dude.  I mean, like, shut the fuck.  Like, what are you running your mouth for?  Shut the fuck up.  I'll bet you Troy will be good.  Yeah.  Yes.  Kind of like maybe a Kinison vibe. 
[00:17:00]  High energy.  Some yelling, maybe, from Troy.  I picture a lot of high energy.  Yeah.  A lot of stage pacing, maybe.  Yeah.  You know, physicality.  Something like that.  Who's going to be the comic that throws down the mic after they're set?  Puts their hands up, like...  Like, boo!  Yeah!  Who's that?  Roland?  Yeah.  He'll drop it on accident.  Is Roland even going to show up today?  Yeah.  I mean, apparently he's got a dream set.  What's a dream set? 
[00:17:30]  This is an all-star set.  I will guarantee today that Roland gets fired for his set.  Oh, damn!  I'm going to guarantee it.  I mean...  That's a guarantee.  That's an opster guarantee.  Wow.  Because I have a feeling that his jokes are going to be a little too fucking harsh and  too real.  Really?  He's made a few people in this company very uncomfortable.  Roland, are you going to get fired today?  No, no, no, no.  You're going to try not to?  I have to move, so my set is nothing about the fine gentleman down the hall.  I got to tell you, man.  This company pays so well that Roland is moving on up, ladies and gentlemen. 
[00:18:00]  Moving on up.  Are you?  All right.  He's tied to a deluxe apartment in the sky?  He was sharing an apartment on the Upper West Side with somebody.  Uh-huh.  He's losing his roommate.  The person's going to L.A., so he's moving on up.  Where are you moving to, Roland?  Long Island City.  Don't get jealous, people.  Pussies are flowing.  And if the manager wanted to come hang out with me in my luxurious apartment, they can't  wait.  I'm not sure if you'll fit.  One at a time. 
[00:18:30]  One at a time.  So, what you have is a little bit of...  I got a dick in the ass, sir.  Maybe you're a little torn.  I just open your ass really wide.  You got a little view of the Ed Koch-Queensboro Bridge.  No.  I have a view of a guy barbecuing and rubbing his nets.  That's my new view.  That's your new view?  My old view is like the luxurious park, people, families walking.  It was really happy.  Are you on the water?  Are you on the East River? 
[00:19:00]  I could jump in there.  I could walk?  No.  No, you're not.  It's on the water, but my apartment face is like...  Long Island City.  Like, um...  They're trying to build it up, but it sucks.  How close to the Citibank building are you?  You're like in New York, man.  That's what it says.  You're like in New York.  Hey, it's a skyscraper.  You have to walk.  There's one building.  It gets stuck.  It doesn't work.  But hey, it's like in New York.  It's one building that looks like all the other buildings in Manhattan.  Yeah.  In Long Island City.  There's just one.  And people sell it like that. 
[00:19:30]  It's like, it's just like New York.  It's just only 10 minutes away.  You're right on the other side of a river.  So it's just a river separating.  Everybody's like this.  We're just 10 minutes away.  And then we just cry inside.  And then you...  Ladies and gentlemen, the Grand Central Station is following us up.  We're having problems on the track.  We're like...  Why not?  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Yeah, he had to move down to Long Island City.  Long Island City.  That's too bad.  That sounds like Manhattan when you say it. 
[00:20:00]  I'm going to have no one to walk around with now.  How much longer do you get to work?  Go to Long Island City, Ope.  You can hang out.  Fuck that.  I think it's a month.  No, no.  How much longer do you get to work?  How much commute length?  I don't know.  It's like 15 minutes from Manhattan, but it's just...  If the trains...  If the trains are the perfect sky...  Yeah, everything's got to work perfectly.  And if there's snow on the track, I'm going to walk in.  So, what's your set going to be like today, Roland?  It's going to be about this and that. 
[00:20:30]  Are you nervous?  Of course.  I'm not a stand-up comic.  What?  I'm scared.  He's...  From what we hear, though, he's got some ringers that have fed him.  They're not ringers.  They just give advice.  They didn't write down anything because they're very busy people.  What kind of advice does a comic give that would help you?  Well, first of all, who did he search out?  Joe McKell.  Keep going.  Bill Burr.  Bill Burr? 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, because he said, just be yourself.  This is what you should do.  You shouldn't do this.  Jimmy Kimmel, give...  Just be yourself!  What's the matter with you?  Right.  Dude, you've got to go up there.  They're going to be animals.  Just smile at them.  Go fuck yourself.  Yeah.  That's pretty much what it is.  They're a bunch of fucking creeps.  Who gives a shit?  To be fair, Sam did call the great Ronnie B in for advice.  During his after show.  So, I'm just saying, though...  I called him for advice for everybody.  Ronnie B has done so many interviews...  Why are you bothering him?  ...with the famous comics. 
[00:21:30]  Yes.  And he's very good.  And him himself is very funny.  Yes.  He was involved with a comedy club down in Florida.  Didn't he do stand-up, too?  And I think he has done stand-up.  So, that's probably a wise gentleman.  You sought out Yoda.  Yes.  Is what you did.  But it was for everybody.  It was on the air.  Everybody was in the room.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Was that the part I missed?  No, it wasn't yesterday.  It was when this was first announced.  Okay.  Yes.  So, I said, I'll seek advice from others, too. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  And apparently, everybody is.  Yeah.  It's like a...  I mean, it's not like I wanted to, but I wanted to try to do the best I could.  So, I seek advice from the best.  Who's going to start this whole thing?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Who's in charge?  I don't know.  I thought you were!  I thought, yeah.  Wait, are we in charge?  Maybe we could have a little hat and you pick your name out of the hat.  A hat!  We'll pick names out of the hat.  Sweetie?  Make it very random.  Are you ready? 
[00:22:30]  Define ready.  You feel okay?  No.  No.  What is your main subject matter?  You're a funny dude, man.  I think you'll be okay.  Yeah.  Well, I don't really...  Everyone on the staff is funny.  He's a funny guy.  There's no people on the staff that aren't funny dudes.  Everyone here has got something funny going on.  Three minutes, while to most people might sound like a commercial break, it's an eternity  worth of stand-up material.  So, you know, I was trying to stick to one thing, but I felt like it was just droning 
[00:23:00]  on, so I just broke it up, so it's jumping around a bit.  Yeah.  I like that.  He doesn't want to reveal what he's going to talk about.  That's more probably the way I'm doing it.  And Jimmy is just basking in this.  I mean, it's probably not that he really is.  But I'm honestly not.  It's a scary thing, but it's done when it's...  You're kind of basking in it, though.  A little bit.  I think it can be very funny.  I think it's something people are scared to do, but when you do it, you realize that  you survive it.  It's not...  It's like, oh, okay, that was nothing.  And let me think, this may launch a couple of comedy careers. 
[00:23:30]  We'll get great audio out of it.  I hope we're recording.  We'll get good audio out of it, and I think somebody will be surprised at how much they  like it or how good they are at it.  Sirius doesn't like recording.  They love recording!  Oh, God.  They love it!  All right.  I saw the change-up last night with the mash-up.  We were all worried, and it was awesome.  It was hilarious.  Change-up was awesome?  It was really, really good.  Even the mash-up.  It looks so swarmy.  Who's that with Ryan?  Wait, wait, wait.  You said even the mash-up?  They love it. 
[00:24:00]  I don't get my fucking movie ideas from those people.  Why?  Are they really critical when it comes to movies?  They're kind of nerdy, man.  They get Gandhi a so-so.  What?  They get Gandhi a movie a so-so.  Gandhi?  I don't know.  Oof.  Why was change-up good?  I'm fucked.  Is that part of...  Get it out of the way.  Get the bad ones out of the way, bro.  Wow.  I'm just dropping the N-bombs now.  Why was the movie change-up good?  It was really funny.  The way the...  Did they have sex?  After they switched roles. 
[00:24:30]  That's all I care about.  Yes.  No.  Oh!  So the guy that now has to play...  No!  No?  Yes or no?  No.  You fell asleep again.  Fuck.  Oh, he fell asleep.  Oh, boy.  I'm seeing the game on Monday.  The game on Monday.  I think I'm going to have to go with you on Monday.  I thought we were going to go see that other movie.  The Steve Carell movie.  Oh, the Steve Carell movie was yesterday at Ocho.  Oh.  So, but today...  Why was change-up good?  It looks like a horrendous comedy.  That's what everybody thought. 
[00:25:00]  Walking in, they're all just like mumbling, it's going to be bad.  And it was really funny.  Was it edgy?  Yeah.  It was.  It was really funny.  Ryan Reynolds and those guys were really funny.  Because like we said, you know, those movies where they switch roles, but they never have  sex because there's a morality thing in Hollywood.  Yeah.  You're telling me they have sex.  That chick is smoking hot.  Yeah, but the married guy, who's Jason Bateman, becomes single guy, and the single  guy in the movie was banging everything.  So now Jason Bateman as the single guy, is he banging everything?  He goes after the hot girl.  But he doesn't have sex.  I can't. 
[00:25:30]  He's like her boobie.  He sucks her boobie?  That is correct, sir.  That is correct, sir.  Did he put the full nipple in his mouth?  Yes.  Sloss it around a little bit?  Did he make this noise?  I made that noise when I sucked it.  Did I see?  Stanley T had a whole mouthful of popcorn so I couldn't hear too well.  Really?  Yeah.  Why are you going to the movies with the mashup? 
[00:26:00]  Well, I went there and they all came.  Why do they go together?  Yeah.  They do everything together.  They do?  They're like the monkeys.  Yeah, why do they do that?  Remember they all lived in the same place and they all hung out in the same house?  They're friends.  They're all wacky together.  It's just like some fucking, you know, like a whole community thing going on there.  One happy group.  We fucking, we split up like fucking, each in our separate directions.  Like roaches when the lights come on. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  That's what this show looks like.  The light is 10 o'clock.  Yeah.  10 o'clock.  We're all fucking out of there.  One under the stove.  One under the fridge.  One behind the kitchen table.  Roaches.  We get it, Joe.  All right.  Roaches, roaches, roaches.  All right.  So it looks like we're ready for the big broadcast.  Who do you think is going to be the best stand up?  I think E-Rock is going to surprise a lot of people.  Yeah?  I do.  Honestly.  I think.  Is the material.  Are we going to have the virus today?  The virus is headlining. 
[00:27:00]  Club Soda Kenny is hosting the comedy show.  Oh.  And the virus will headline at the end.  I'm assuming that you guys.  Wait.  So we don't really have to do anything today.  Nothing.  That's what I was thinking.  It was like, wow, this works great.  Give yourselves raises today.  Yeah.  Just do it.  Or actually, just at least ask for one.  I won't comment.  Have you asked for raises this week?  I'm not talking about it.  Oh, they got him.  They got him.  They nailed him.  They nailed him again.  They nailed him.  It's none of your business.  I would never talk about raises in the air.  They got him.  Where's the fucking star? 
[00:27:30]  That was T-F-U, didn't you?  Yeah, dig in the ass.  Where's the scar?  It's none of your business.  We're talking about comedy.  Oh, shit.  Oh, they got to him.  Is it good news or bad news that they got to you?  Was it one of those things like, look, it's going to happen, but we really don't want  you on the air talking about it anymore.  A stern warning.  Yes or no?  Oh, they got you, Sam.  You're useless in this business now.  What do you mean?  Don't let those fuckers dictate your career ever. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, fuck.  Boy, do I want to say something today.  They got to him.  But it's a good, positive day because we're going to broadcast.  It really is.  I want to keep today as an up, fun day.  But I've discovered we've got a weasel among us.  A fucking weasel.  What?  Oh, yeah.  I think you should say it.  Not today, boys and girls.  Wait, wait, wait.  For 15 minutes.  In the perimeter here?  No.  Okay.  Oh, boy.  Right outside the perimeter?  Yeah.  If you're on Google+, it wouldn't be in the friend circle. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, right outside.  Do you know how to work Google+, by the way?  I don't either.  I just signed up for it and I put my profile picture.  I'm like, that's great.  I just got, I accepted an invite thing and that's as far as I go.  I'm Harry Potter on Google+.  Oh, that's your name?  Yeah.  I decided to go with Harry Potter.  That's a good one.  It wasn't taken.  How close is the weasel?  Well, I assumed. 
[00:29:00]  This is what I found out.  Okay.  Hope he's doing a little writing.  Wow, he's really thinking this out, too.  He's thinking it out.  He's writing.  This is going to have to be destroyed, by the way.  Oh, right.  Yeah, that was what I heard.  Oh, right, right, yeah.  Yeah.  What happened to the comedy talk?  Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, right, right, right, right, right?  Yeah, yeah, no, I, I'm-  You know all that, right? 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's a weasel move, man.  That is not a good move.  Nah.  Not good at all.  But it's typical.  Of course it is.  Of course.  Yeah.  Does it to himself.  Anyway, what time are we going over there, man?  We'll be leaving the studio here at 7.30.  That's when we will be playing the worst of the walkover.  There's too much walking going on there.  Worst of the walkover. 
[00:30:00]  I love that, too.  It was like, uh, when we first were thinking about doing this, like, do you guys want to  broadcast the walkover?  We can, you know, get that together.  And I'm like, logistic.  And I didn't say this, but I'm thinking in my head.  But logistically, that's a fucking nightmare.  They would never be able to pull this off.  So I never questioned it again, just knowing it would never happen.  Well, you remember that we used to have to have a cart where they would push the cart  with the stuff in it?  Yeah, yeah.  It was like, because it was hard to keep the broadcast away.  Danny had a satellite dish on his head.  Yeah.  He's just wheeling the cart. 
[00:30:30]  And that was only a few years ago.  Yeah.  I bet you now it would be nothing to do that.  And the antennas had to be stuck out the window.  Right.  But now they're on the 36th floor, which is a lot farther.  Yeah.  Can we just move back to our old place?  No.  I say yes.  God, I would love that.  No, you can't.  Is it a ghost town over there?  Erin Andrews is showing her nipples on MSNBC, The Morning Joe, right now.  She's really sexy.  She is so fucking hot.  What have we got here?  And the only reason she's popular now is because of that Peeping Tom thing.  Yeah.  It's the only fucking reason.  And she doesn't dress down. 
[00:31:00]  She's now as famous as she is.  Ooh.  Yeah.  Look at that.  Look at that.  She's beautiful.  Ooh, yes.  Game talk.  Right.  Stop with game talk.  What do you think is going to happen today?  I don't know.  It looks like they have forward front lines.  Shut up.  Fucking shut up.  Fucking.  I don't know.  It seems like they got to keep them.  They got to keep them contained for the first two quarters because if not, I don't know 
[00:31:30]  about that.  Shut your face.  Fucking unlistenable.  It does mean nothing.  It's awful.  It really means nothing.  Well, you know, who knows what's going to happen with him.  I mean, after the third inning, sometimes he tends to start throwing those sinkers.  Really?  Does he?  Fucking shut up.  Who fucking cares?  Who gives a fuck?  And Andrea Pizer took a shot at one of our boys. 
[00:32:00]  We're close with the Mad Dog crew and she had to take her stupid shot.  You got the paper over there, right?  Give me the paper.  Paper to papers.  They were doing a whole thing on women's World Cup soccer.  Oh, wow.  Exciting.  And one of the hosts over there on Mad Dog Radio was having fun with it, calling them  lesbians and stuff, as well as you should.  Be careful.  It's basically saying, were they lesen out or something like that, and Andrea Pizer just  up in arms and really mad that no one is taking them to task. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, right on like that.  Oh, wow.  What was that, Sam?  That must be a tone.  Go to your shelters.  Go to your shelters.  How is that?  I guess that's a tone being sent over from the other place.  At least it's lower now.  Okay.  I'm raising.  I hear it in my right ear.  I'm raising my right ear.  Left.  Left.  Right.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Wow. 
[00:33:00]  This is a test of the emergency broadcast system.  Do you have a...  Broadcasters in your area, in cooperation...  Oh, what?  Is that over the air or just for us?  I think that's over the air.  Do you have the pot on for the hard rock?  I think that's over the air.  I think that's over the air.  No, let's listen in.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Let's see how long it takes for someone to notice this.  And the home of the brave. 
[00:33:30]  I can't find the fucking article now, man.  Someone talk.  At least we had something to listen to while you were...  Yeah.  I don't know where the fuck it is.  I guess that's...  Oh, here we go.  Sports jerk radioactive!  Oh, God.  The headline writers at papers should be lined up.  Andrea.pizer at nypost.com.  This fucking bitch.  In radio, as in politics, misogyny. 
[00:34:00]  Misogyny.  Misogyny to me.  Misogyny?  Monopoly.  Monopoly is the last permissible form of bigotry.  Oh, is it?  A reader sent clips from the Mad Dog Sports Channel on XM Radio, recorded during the Women's  World Cup Soccer Final July 17th, when the United States lost to Japan.  The host, identified as Scott Wetzel, repeatedly calls team members Lady Lezzies.  That's great.  Lady Lezzies.  That's kind of cute. 
[00:34:30]  He discusses a gal's breast size.  Eh?  Problem?  She is a little like Brandi Chastain.  He said, referring to the player who ripped off her shirt and revealed a sports bra during  the U.S. Women's World Cup victory over China in 1999.  There's no sense taking her top off.  No sense.  Meaning, because her boobs are too small.  Right?  That was 11 years ago?  Uh, 12.  Holy fuck!  That's 12 years ago.  My goodness.  Uh, the reaction?  Not much.  It wasn't because no one was listening, because he was getting calls on the topic, and sadly, 
[00:35:00]  most of the callers agreed with him.  Wrote my spy.  Spy.  What would GOP target Michelle Bachman say?  Go away.  Who cares what she'd say?  She'd say, ow, my head hurts.  The stupid Andrea Peisers.  The stupid migraines.  This is how guys, this is guys.  Make an excedrin.  Shut up.  This is how guys talk.  Yeah.  It's a sports talk show.  Relax.  Yeah, we're going to talk about bra sizes and booby sizes and all that shit. 
[00:35:30]  And cunts.  And pussies.  You don't think, uh, some of the things that go on on woman talk shows, on these women's  talk shows, you don't think they offend men when men are just portrayed as fucking  dolts and morons and fucking, you know, oh, my stupid husband couldn't fucking get  this done, or, you know, so we talk about tits and pussie gives a shit.  How many times are they talking about Jeter's butt? 
[00:36:00]  Like, ooh, he's so cute, I'll have to pitch his butt.  Oh, for some reason that's okay.  Yeah.  Which it should be, by the way.  Sure.  I don't give a fuck.  You can't have it both ways.  If you're going to talk about Jeter's butt, we're going to talk about...  Pussy.  My puss-a.  Pussy.  I can't do it.  By the way, our tone radio show that we just did?  Yeah.  More listeners than the Broadway channel.  Ratings just in.  Wow.  Ratings just in.  Wow.  That's great.  The Broadway channel. 
[00:36:30]  That's right.  People don't like, uh, hearing, uh, Oklahoma, where the...  No?  None of that?  Something from Guys and Dolls?  Yuck.  Like a dick in the ass?  Eee.  Oh, oh, oh, the Broadway channel.  Oh, oh, I love it.  Oh.  Are they still over there in the other building?  What?  Oh, my God.  That other building's just wasted.  Why'd they give up the rent on it?  No, it's gone.  It's finally gone?  Yeah, a few months ago.  They let it all go.  We don't own it anymore.  That's so...  Why so high? 
[00:37:00]  They have to wait for the lease to run out.  Yeah.  Why couldn't we stay there until the lease ran out?  Wouldn't that have been...  Well, then we'd have been here now, being all disappointed, like, fuck.  Yeah, but we would have had two solid years of our state-of-the-art, you know, facility.  That's true.  I'm not having to look at, uh, anybody walking down the hall.  I'm a man enough to admit that I'm just not as smart as these guys.  They know what they're doing.  Yeah, they do.  They know what they're fucking doing, eh?  Of course they do.  We gotta let them lead.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah?  Oh, yeah, we do.  76 trombones led the big parade with 110 cornets close at hand.  What is that?  I'm singing from, I think that was the Music Man.  Yes, it was, I think.  I'm doing the Broadway channel.  Led the big parade with 110 cornets up my ass.  They're followed by rose and rose of the finest virtuosos, the cream of every famous band, 76 trombone. 
[00:38:00]  All right.  Look at how gay this is.  I love how you say all right, because you were the one that did it.  You could have stopped it at any time.  Well, you know why?  Can we play rusty trombone now, because wasn't that the same song?  Yeah, it really, it was.  You got that, he rocked.  We did like this play in school in third grade, so I had to sing the Music Man.  How do you know all the works, though?  That's stuck in my head from the third grade.  It's fucking terrible. 
[00:38:30]  It's horrible.  That really is weird.  Can I say it, Sam?  Turn it on a little bit.  The color really weird.  Why is the color and technicolor of the film so fucking weird and bright?  Ah, it's technicolor.  Why is that color so good?  Or did they just use colors better than?  No, it wasn't realistic.  They definitely used colors way better back in the day.  They got all freaked out when it went from black and white to color, and they're like,  Motherfucker, we gotta color this shit up.  But it looks great.  They knew how to use their colors.  Technicolor and cinemascope. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, I really do think they just threw a lot of fucking color in there.  But it wasn't a realistic color.  Like, now, look at this.  Look at the hats.  What a way to live.  They're blue hats.  Look how vibrant it is.  Yeah, it is.  I want to walk down the street looking that goddamn good.  I want to be in technicolor.  Look, Larry Hickox is in this.  I'm the music man.  I like to sing music, and I'm a man.  Hence my name.  Music do should be more accurate, but I never put it on the marquee. 
[00:39:30]  Look at Timmy Everett really going to town.  Where's our rusty trombone song?  The Buffalo Bills were in that?  What do you mean?  Oh, it's a music, it's a bunch of singers.  What year is this from?  Ronnie Howard?  Old.  Ron Howard.  Yeah, Ronnie Howard was in it.  1962.  I think he sings a little song.  Here we go, everybody.  Turn this up.  A rusty trombone is best with a filthy whore.  She'll reach around and get you off with her hand. 
[00:40:00]  All the while, she'll lick your spot by your tiny balloon nut.  Hope you didn't eat too much bran.  A rusty trombone may not be moral.  While I think this sounds kind of gay.  I'd rather get some oral with the finger up my butt.  But that's me.  What the hell?  I'm a nut.  Come on, honey.  Start the music. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  You play that well.  I think that holds up, huh?  I remember that one.  Can I tell you the timing of that was so good that until it said rusty, the first three  words I thought was actually audio from the fucking YouTube.  Because we're watching.  Because he's walking with his arms flailing and the rusty trombone.  I'm like, wait a minute.  That's not right.  Yeah.  That was a big one.  Ladies and gentlemen, Jay Moise.  Jay Moise.  Hiya, Moise.  Hi, Jay.  What's going on, Jay?  We're getting out of here in a few minutes to do a live broadcast.  First one in probably, I don't know, 10 years or something like that. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, it's been quite a while.  Yeah, it's been a while.  Taking it back to the streets.  Getting everybody pregnant on the streets in New York.  Old school.  What are you doing, a fantasy football draft?  No, I said no to that.  Right, Sam?  Tell him.  No, I hope he didn't indeed say no to that.  He refused.  First he said maybe, and then he said absolutely not.  I said maybe knowing that I would be part of the huge press push, and then I told him no.  Is that what it was?  I'm real smart.  Just got the press release out of it.  So now everyone thinks I'm doing it, but I said no to that thing weeks ago. 
[00:41:30]  He's just going over there for eggs with chives?  What are you doing over there?  We don't know what we're doing.  We're doing a little.  We're doing like a couple hours of, you know.  Shenanigans.  Bring the freaks up on stage.  Have them do some shit.  Oh, liggity-diggity.  Yeah, one of them deals.  Anthony, when you see those movies with all that color, it looks just like the future.  It's just like the future.  Ah, in the future, everything will be in Technicolor and Cinemascope. 
[00:42:00]  It makes me so happy when you see the future.  The future.  And you know what?  The future never comes.  Like, not the future that we want.  The one with the Mylar suits and spacecraft.  God damn, you're right.  The future never comes.  The future never really comes.  Like, the future is an hour from now.  We can't just go there.  No.  We have to wait for it.  Always.  Where's our flying cars?  No flying cars.  No flying cars.  I look out on the street.  There's still telephone poles with wires on them.  What the fuck is that?  Jetpacks.  Come on. 
[00:42:30]  No jetpacks.  Getting closer with the jetpacks.  Yeah, you're going to fucking commute like that?  Hell no.  I'd love a jetpack.  What about E-Rock's jetpack?  Jesus Christ.  You wouldn't have to go to the Lincoln Tunnel.  You just jet over the Hudson.  That'd be great.  That would be great.  You'd burn your heels.  But it's never going to happen.  You'd burn your heels.  Everyone would have sore heels from the fucking jet fire.  That'd be like a new word that people would be saying.  Things like, hey, I'm going to be, I got to go burn my heels.  Take it easy.  I'll see you tomorrow.  Heel burning. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I got the solution.  Fuck jetpacks.  Yeah.  Zip lines over the Hudson River.  How fucking cool would that be?  You want to just zip line around New York?  Dude, you got your briefcase, your fucking business suit on.  It would make your life a little more exciting.  You'd zip line right to Manhattan from the Jersey Shore.  Depending on who's doing it.  Why not?  It makes it for some good jokes, too.  Yeah, really?  I'd prefer an all-inclusive line, not just for one group.  Oh, Jimmy, you're in court.  Oh, isn't he?  No, but it's like a bunch of zippers or something like Laurel.  Wearing pants. 
[00:43:30]  Would you zip line around the city if you could?  I would zip line my ass off.  They should go from building to building like that.  Fuck yeah.  Start off at the top of the Empire State Building, and then you slowly just go down a little.  Jay, have you ever zip lined?  I have not, but Jimmy made me think of a great Walken story, because he said those group of  people, and I asked Walken once on the set of Suicide Kings, I said, what was the worst  part of doing the deer hunter?  Because they were in the Philippines for like months and stuff. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  I go, what was like the worst part?  And he really thought about it.  He looked at me, and he said, I swear to God, it's true.  And he looked at me, and he goes, the slopes.  Oh, no fucking way.  Really?  I swear to God.  He goes, they're disgusting people.  They're very passionate, they're spectacators.  And I looked at him like, what are you?  They spit constantly.  You're about to do a scene, and the guy holding the camera, oh, hey, we're down here. 
[00:44:30]  Honest to God, I thought it through, and looked at me like, the slopes.  That's very funny.  The man's crazy.  He just is fucking insane.  I love it.  I saw Dogs of War the other day.  Yeah?  That's an old Walken fucking movie.  I've never seen that.  He was a young guy, just fucking, it was great, played like a mercenary.  It was a pretty good movie.  I liked it.  You ever see that one, Jay? 
[00:45:00]  Dogs of War?  I have.  What's weird is when you see old Walken movies, young Walken, he was gorgeous.  Yeah, like piercing eyes and shit.  He gave a great, like, I'm gonna fucking kill you look.  Jay just mentioned something.  He was in Annie Hall as the psycho brother that gave the speech about wanting to drive  into fucking oncoming traffic.  I have to go, Dwayne, I'm sort of, I'm too back on planet Earth, you know.  You know.  Yeah, he's in Annie Hall. 
[00:45:30]  Wow, I don't remember from that.  Fuck yeah.  Yeah, he was her brother.  Yeah, Opie said it.  And I was fucking slamming it.  No, he gives this whole speech.  I was getting all sweaty waiting for my spot for my impression.  Yeah, but he gives this whole speech about how he gets this urge to just drive it to  oncoming traffic.  And then the next scene, he has to drive Woody to the airport or something.  It's a great scene.  Woody Allen was, like, literally leaving the bathroom, walking down the hall.  And he goes, oh, hey, how are you?  And he goes, sometimes when I'm driving, I just have to via my car into the oncoming 
[00:46:00]  traffic, crashing metal, glass flying everywhere.  It's something I must do.  And he goes on and on.  And then Woody Allen, like, excuse him.  So, excuse me, Dwayne, I'm due back on planet Earth, you know.  And then he sits at the table where they all look at Woody Allen, where he looks like a  rabbi with, like, the collars and the messes and stuff.  And they go, oh, Dwayne will take you to the airport.  They just cut to Woody Allen sitting in the passenger seat and walking, driving. 
[00:46:30]  I think I just saw a young Tom Berenger in there, too.  Like, Dogs of War?  Was that him?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that's great.  That's Tom Berenger.  God damn.  He'll always be Barnes to me.  Y'all talking about killing?  Barnes!  Oh, wow.  Oh, my God.  Good call, Ant, with that mustache.  He's got the 70s mustache.  Jesus.  Even though the movie was 1980, but.  Well, I like to hear about it, potheads.  He, Willem Dafoe, kind of fucked him out of an Oscar, I think. 
[00:47:00]  You think?  Yeah.  Because Dafoe got nominated because he had that great Christ pose at the end of.  Yeah, yeah, you know, that's the big poster shot.  But Berenger was, like, the guy.  I mean, Berenger, when he says to them, 70, you boys, I'm a hero, I'm a lonesome.  Yeah.  Kill me.  Kill me.  You fucked up fire mission!  Check your fire!  Check your fire!  He really wanted them to kill him.  He wanted out.  Yeah, he was done.  You gotta watch it again.  It's crazy.  And even at the end, when Charlie Sheen's standing over him with a gun, he's like, 
[00:47:30]  get me a medic, Mark, get me a medic.  And then he's just like, you know, go ahead, do it then, fuck it.  Give me a medic.  Hey, Jay, how's the podcast been doing?  It was doing good.  I was gonna call, what was it, Monday, I think I was gonna call you guys to promote  the podcast, but you had Mark Maron on, and him and me are like, he's like the constant  competition, because he does like one every hour.  And then Joe DeRosa was coming in, and Mark Maron is not, I say this, I like Mark, but he's 
[00:48:00]  not a happy guy.  So I think if I called, because you and I, Ope, texted about this, I just thought if  I called while Maron was in, it would be perceived as me like sort of blowing up his  spot, like he's in to promote his podcast.  Yeah.  So I was like, you know, he's got a good podcast.  You know, it's funny to me, because my podcast was number one, it was number one for like  every time it comes out, it's out later today, I think, or tomorrow, I'm not sure, but it's 
[00:48:30]  number one, and him and I, he'll be like three, I'll be one, or he'll be one, I'll be two,  and three, and like, he's got like Albert Brooks, and Florin Henderson, and Rob Briggle, and  like, I'm in my fucking garage, like my manager.  Does he have, he got some good guests, right?  Oh yeah, he gets everybody.  He does a good job, he gets good interviews.  He had Jonathan Winters recently.  Oh, did he?  He went to Jonathan Winters' house.  I can't imagine banging the phones all day to get guests for your podcast.  He's got a live space, a live audience. 
[00:49:00]  Does he now, Mark?  Really?  Yeah.  Oh yeah, he's always at like Upright Citizens Brigade, and he can pick us around.  This is the future.  But mine is, we just do it in my garage.  I gotta tell you, man, I checked out a couple of your podcasts, really liked it.  More stories, right?  Oh yeah, people have been talking about that a lot.  I was really pleasantly surprised how focused you were on your podcast.  You said that, you emailed me.  I know, I'm sorry.  No.  Well, you kind of get a little ADD-ish with us, which is fine. 
[00:49:30]  It works, obviously.  But I'm like, god damn, he's focused, and he's like, he's setting the table and making  sure everyone listening knows what's going on.  And I was impressed, Jay, man.  Thank you, brother.  People think when I'm in the studio with you guys, like, is he on drugs, like, Jamie's  a fucking crazy maniac.  Well, yeah, sure.  But what you don't understand is, when I go in with you guys, when I'm in the studio with  Opie and Andy and a little Jimmy Norton, you get super fucking excited, because, like, 
[00:50:00]  it's your friends, and they have their own radio show, so it's like, hey, guys, let's  get there.  It's like you want to save the rec center by having a breakdance company.  God damn, I'm glad I landed that fucking plane.  Yeah, I was all right, man.  This kid's getting a little fruity.  I don't give a care, Jimmy.  How great is that, I don't give a care, I-D-A-C, I-D-G-A-C.  I don't give a care.  Colin's tweets are amongst the funniest on Twitter.  The one I read where I actually laughed and almost choked, because I was drinking, I don't 
[00:50:30]  know, a fucking Hawaiian pot and syrup, like it matters, I was drinking a beverage, and  when he said, just thought for a book cover, me jumping off a fire escape and kicking some  idiot in the face.  No one gets, like, there's people that don't get what he's doing, and actually say, you  know, Colin, you were a lot funnier, you know, years ago, what do you mean, why don't you  use, like, bad language? 
[00:51:00]  Because he's like, I don't like the blue language.  There's no reason to keep it PG.  I like what he says, if he does one in me, he's got to go up on stage and do a spinning  back kick, kick the, I'll kick the trophy out of him from the other hand, it's stupid.  And they'll just catch an emitter, and I'll go up to the microphone and say, whatever,  Trevor.  And I'll walk down to Lake Street, and I'll walk out with my trophy, and they'll be like,  whoa, who dat?  This is the kid that won this trophy, guys.  Who dat, dude? 
[00:51:30]  Well, listen, we got to...  Yeah?  Go, go, Jay, I'm sorry.  I have nothing to say.  I changed a diaper, and I said, before I go back to bed, let me call the bu-bu-bu-boys.  Well, we got to kind of cut it short, because we got to head over to the hard rock cabin.  Yeah, yeah.  Have fun over there.  More stories on iTunes?  A new one coming out today, or tomorrow?  Yeah, today's the one with Bert Kreischer tells a story about when he got raped by a bear.  What a lock.  We had Bert finally...  The machine.  Yeah, you finally had Bert on, my man. 
[00:52:00]  We finally had him on.  I didn't realize he was the guy that was opening up for you and all that.  I didn't know shit.  He is, like, obsessively in love with your show.  Like, he's probably your...  I'm sure he told you all about it with his fucking Don Knotts giggle.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I go, Bert, you're like a young Don Knotts.  He goes, ooh, why do you say that?  Yeah, I told him he's got hot lead and cold feet.  My Don Knotts was aimed at Jimmy, and he didn't take the bat off his shoulder. 
[00:52:30]  I was bummed out.  Chip hit it, though.  Chip, more stories.  You'd think there was, like, a lot of them or something.  Oh, wow.  All right, Jay, we got to go.  Yeah.  We got to go, man.  See you guys.  Thanks a lot.  Check out the podcast.  He's really doing a great job with that.  More stories.  Oh, and Jay Moore, 37 on Twitter.  Jay Moore's.  All right.  We're going to break and eat a little food, and then I think we're going to head to the  Hard Rock very soon.  Yeah. 
[00:53:00]  I need a friend to go to Chicago with.  What?  Fedor's fighting this Saturday.  I want to go.  Let's go.  You want to do it?  I've never seen Fedor fight, and this might be his last fight.  What day?  Chicago.  Saturday.  You got flights?  No.  I haven't even checked.  You want to start driving now?  It's too far.  We should road trip.  How many hours is that?  Ten.  Oh.  No.  Me and you in a car for ten hours?  I wouldn't even be in a car alone.  I wouldn't be in a car with Ozzy for ten hours.  Yes, I would.  We go old school.  We used to drive to Boston together. 
[00:53:30]  Boston's a terrible drive, though.  That was fun.  Two and a half, three hours?  Yeah, that's fine.  It's sort of fun.  I can do Boston.  The problem is, Jimmy has to stop literally every, be honest, 20 minutes to pee.  See, that would drive me crazy.  Every place I think I can meet somebody, I run in.  Jimmy drove with me once in D.C., and I was lost a little bit.  Oh, my God.  That's right.  And it was probably the most harrowing, nerve-wracking experience for Jimmy to be in a vehicle with me  when I'm losing my fucking mind. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah, your girlfriend at the time gave us the wrong director.  Didn't she go like, oh, no, I know where we're going.  Of course.  Of course she did.  And I'm like, fuck!  This fucking thing just goes around in circles again.  Now I'm going north again!  I forgot about that.  Oh, I was freaking out.  See, we're similar.  I yell and scream like that to management.  About management, you do that on the road.  I do it in the car.  It's the exact fucking same thing, man.  I got in a screaming match yesterday with a black car driver.  One of these Lincoln Town car drivers.  I hate those guys.  I can't stand them. 
[00:54:30]  Like I said, whenever I read in the paper that one was found slumped over the wheel  in the Bronx with a bullet in his head, I just go like, oh, well.  Oh, well.  It happens.  Worse than cabs.  Oh.  So this motherfucker is...  And this is the deal.  They say this shit unto the guys that, oh, they're just driving safely.  You drive crazy.  I'm driving safely.  No, you're not.  You're doing your cunt, fuck, savage paperwork at every light. 
[00:55:00]  And while they're driving.  Between fucking lights.  Between blocks.  They're filling out their stupid paperwork.  They're doing whatever they got to do.  Pull over and do it, you fucko.  I told him.  And then he, so he made me, absolutely made me miss a fucking key light.  I know the timing, all these lights and shit.  And I don't expect everybody to know the timing of the lights.  But as long as they're driving the right speed, if I catch a red light, I catch a red light.  Whatever.  This motherfucker, the car in front of him is way the fuck ahead. 
[00:55:30]  He's barely moving.  He's fucking looking down to the side.  And I know he's riding shit.  So the light turns yellow and then red.  And I pull up next to him.  And he's looking at me now like I'm a maniac.  Because I beeped at him.  And he rolls the window down.  What is your problem?  I go, my problem.  I go, do you even want to get anywhere?  I go, because I do.  And I'm fucking stuck behind the lights of you.  You fucking piece of shit.  And I'm yelling at him.  He starts going, fuck you. 
[00:56:00]  Fuck you.  Like, fuck me?  Fuck you.  And it was just a fuck you fest back and forth.  And now we're right at the crosswalk.  Right, right.  Because that's where it stopped.  You know, the light.  It was just him and me.  And I went around his right after I beeped.  So we're both on the crosswalk.  The people crossing the street are, there's two people, two virgins.  The horrified people, which are like the tourists.  And the New Yorkers that are just laughing their fucking asses off. 
[00:56:30]  Of course.  So I go, I'm getting in front of you.  I'm getting in front of you.  And he starts edging forward.  I go, oh, no.  I pull the Escalade right in front of his car.  Like, I would have hit him.  I don't care.  At this point, I don't care.  I will fucking tap your car.  I'm not going to ram into you.  But I don't care.  I'll tap the fucking thing.  Am I going to get another lease and fucking get another car?  So he starts, like, really getting pissed at me.  I go, no.  Ha.  And then I get real mature.  I go, ah, I'm going first.  Ah, ha. 
[00:57:00]  Ah, ha.  Fuck you.  And the light changed.  And then he does this half-hearted effort to try to get in front of me.  And you know me.  The pedals to the fucking floor.  The fucking engines.  And I just get in front of him.  And then get stopped at the next light.  Now he's behind me, out the window, going, now where are you going?  Now where are you going?  And then I roll the window down.  I turn around.  I go, well, if I wasn't stuck behind you, motherfucker, I'd have been long gone past this light, too. 
[00:57:30]  You cocksucker.  How's your blood pressure?  Great.  It's perfect.  That's good.  Yeah.  It really is.  Yeah, it's like fucking, what is it, 130, over 80, something like that.  2,000 over 136.  Why aren't you videotaping this?  You know why?  I was videotaping, like, my drives home.  And it got boring because nothing was really happening.  It's really like trying to catch a moment.  Dare I say it's a big commitment? 
[00:58:00]  It's hit or miss.  It does take a big commitment to do this.  Road break scares me, though, because I've seen footage of people, and you hear stories of people who are shot, and, like, really weird shit happens.  Like, normally it's just two guys yelling at each other.  But there are so many cases of, like, that guy with Kenny, like, that guy didn't know who Kenny was.  Like, he didn't know that Kenny is not only a fucking guy who's probably allowed to carry what he wants to carry because of what he did for a living, but because he's a fucking killer. 
[00:58:30]  He's a two-  Kenny's a black belt.  You're a killer!  He's a black belt in two martial arts, Kenny.  Yeah.  He's a fucking tough dude.  He's a problem.  And that guy's just yelling, fuck you, fuck, like, not knowing that Kenny is six foot five.  Yeah, he will rip you apart.  Like, you know.  You just gotta size up the person, then decide.  But you never know who's carrying him.  That's what scares him.  If it's a soccer mom, come on.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's true, but I don't like to do that because I don't like to yell at women or old people because I'm like, if I wouldn't yell at a six foot five black dude, I shouldn't yell at some old lady because that's a pussy move, so I don't do it.  I will fucking voice my opinions with anybody. 
[00:59:00]  You do.  Anthony screams at our vets.  That fucking pisses me off.  Well, that's because.  And if they want to get out of the car and escalate the situation, I'll fucking open.  The easiest thing is opening the door.  Oh, you said opening the door.  Okay.  No, no.  Opening the door and just kicking it into the person.  Yeah.  Like, people don't think.  They could go right up to your door and most people just kind of back off and stuff.  The easiest thing is you open your door, kick the fucking door right into them.  Right into them.  And then you drive away and go, ah, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[00:59:30]  Have you done that one?  Fuck you.  Not yet.  Okay.  No one's ever gotten out of the car.  I'm such a raving lunatic when these things happen that no one really gets out of the  car.  I think because I'm like, ah, I think I'm not saying I'm a menacing, frightening guy, but  I really am pissed and I think they know it.  You become a bit of a psycho.  I've seen it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Fuck you.  You become very scary when you have to.  It's a very personal thing when people fuck you over on the road. 
[01:00:00]  I can't stand it.  It's a really weird personal thing.  I hate it.  That's why when someone cuts you off, I've had this happen.  So I told you one time I was on a Pennsylvania turnpike in the left lane and it was raining.  It's my old Saturn.  And a guy is cutting into my lane.  We're doing 65 miles an hour.  And I'm like, my mind immediately processed, you're going to have an accident.  Oh, shit.  So aim for the divider and try to stop.  But I knew I was about to have an accident.  So I fucking slam on the horn and he probably missed me by three inches.  And he veers back out into the middle lane. 
[01:00:30]  And the rage hit me like this motherfucker.  You don't look?  And I got up next to him and he gave the sheepish wave like, yeah, I'm sorry about that.  I immediately wasn't angry.  Oh, because he acknowledged that he was an asshole.  It's like somebody stepping on your foot and you're going, oh, sorry, man.  He acknowledged he was an asshole.  Okay.  And that's something that I rarely ever see.  Very rarely do people do that.  There's such fucking...  Oh, yesterday I went to Jersey to pick up my trade of leases.  I got another car.  And I'm fucking coming with a GW. 
[01:01:00]  It's a two lanes into one merge.  Everyone has to merge.  And the guy on my left merges and then it's my turn.  And the guy behind him is easing up.  Oh, you fucking cunt.  If everybody just zippered, you know, one and one, one, one, one, left, right, left,  right, left.  And he fucking...  I would have had to hit him to stop him.  And this is why I'm not qualified to own a weapon because I wouldn't shoot him, but  I absolutely would have brandished the weapon.  Oh, no.  I absolutely would have brandished it.  You would have gotten it taken away from you. 
[01:01:30]  I would have gone to jail.  But I mean, I'm driving next to him.  And he looked like an old Russian.  He looked like he was in his 50s.  He was just a slumped over old Russian or Greek guy and a stupid, like, father-in-law  with him.  It just...  It was a...  And the fucking...  It was all consuming.  Yeah, yeah.  And I'm driving over the bridge and he's, like, behind me and I'm trying to slow down  just to look at him.  Yeah, yeah.  And I just keep thinking of Kenny going, why do you let this upset...  And I'm like, why is this upsetting me so much?  The guy's a cunt.  Why do I feel like I lost and I want to murder him? 
[01:02:00]  Yes, yes.  I want to hit his car with mine.  That's just a human emotion.  But it's beyond...  That's a very normal emotion to just express.  I'll roll windows down and yell things like...  I will yell things like, I'm fucking getting in.  I don't care what you do.  Like when they get right on the bumper of the guy in front of them.  And it's like, they're not getting in.  It's like, first of all, since we're zippering...  It's a zipper merge, there's going to be traffic anyway.  Even I understand traffic.  I'm not the guy...  Believe it or not, I'm not the zip in and out of traffic guy. 
[01:02:30]  I'll zip around cars if there's a big opening in front of three cars going abreast, ruining  the whole fucking roadway.  I'll wait.  And if there's an opening, I'll take it.  Yeah, sure.  If I see a shitload of traffic in front, where am I going?  I understand these things.  I'm not that crazy.  But I will yell at people that are pulling that bumper thing and go, dude, I'm getting  in.  There's nothing you're going to do that will prevent me from getting in here, because you  don't want your car fucked up, and I don't care. 
[01:03:00]  So I will keep coming over on you.  And then they do stop, and that's it.  Have you said that to people?  Oh, yeah.  I yelled.  I go, I don't give a shit.  I backed right into a cab.  Backed right into him.  There was a cab on my ass, and he had been fucking with me, and he wanted to get around  me, and he kept, like, jockeying for position.  I put my truck in reverse, and just went, bump, hit his bumper, he's like, hey!  And it's like, fuck you! 
[01:03:30]  And then I took off.  It's like, what?  Now he knows to stay off my ass and don't fuck with me.  I don't even care.  I don't care.  It's my battle wagon.  I love it.  I wouldn't do it in the Mustang, but that's what that truck is made for.  We got a break, because we got to start figuring out how we get to the high rock and all that.  So people are lining up, and it should be fun today.  Oh, really quick.  Someone said Grand Theft Kumia right here.  And that is absolutely right.  In the morning, when the lights are changing, and they go in order, and they go in order, 
[01:04:00]  the lights, green, green, green, green, green, pedestrians try to cross, and I get them  running.  There's nothing more fun than watching a pedestrian have to run through the crosswalk, because  you're bearing down on them.  I don't approach pedestrians.  I bear down on them.  What's going on here?  What is this?  Oh, that's good.  Jimmy told them.  I said it.  I said it.  I said it.  I said it.  Jimmy told them.  We'll take a break.  Why would you listen to me? 
[01:04:30]  I'm only doing stand-up for 21 years, and I've been doing live events the entire time.  Why would you?  Look, I know that asshole doesn't like being on the radio, but get his fucking ass down  here during the break.  I'm serious.  We're not showing up.  Oh, boy.  Get his ass down here immediately.  Ah, summertime. 
[01:05:00]  What a day for the beach.  Absolute bliss.  You hungry little fella.  Have a french fry.  No, no.  Don't feed the birds.  Why not?  Great.  Now they're going to swarm us and never leave us alone.  Holy shit.  That's some flock of birds.  I told you not to feed them.  No.  Get away.  Get away.  No.  Get away.  Get away.  Get them off.  Get them off.  Fucking birds. 
[01:05:30]  She was a prom queen who could have any guy she wanted.  He was a high school outcast looking for love.  Stay away from my girlfriend.  No matter how hard he tried, she would never notice him until...  No, no.  It's Bobo.  Bobo Loco.  Action.  Bobo.  Suspense.  Tell me what it's all about.  The thrill ride of a lifetime. 
[01:06:00]  Screaming for blood and looking for love.  She wants it.  She wants it.  She wants it.  She wants it.  She wants it.  She wants it.  A man over the edge of insanity.  Bobo Loco.  I won't stop.  I won't stop.  Sirius XM.  The virus.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:06:30]  Oh, Rob Zombie.  Yeah, it's Zombie.  I Twittered, too.  If you want to come down.  It's on 57th Street between 7th and 8th.  We're only going to be there from 8th to 10.  We have some stuff planned. 
[01:07:00]  So come down.  There should be some availability.  43rd.  Wait.  Are you 43rd?  Yeah, I was like, wait a minute.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm thinking Hard Rock.  You gave the old location?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Wow.  That was years ago.  That's been closed up for years.  Seven years, maybe.  43rd and Broadway.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, they decided to go to Times Square back in the 40s, Jim.  43rd and Broadway is the Hard Rock.  Oh, no.  I'm so glad you said that. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  I remember when they moved down to Times Square and John Lennon was down there giving a pair of pants.  At the top of the marquee.  Yes, exactly.  See?  Got the point.  It's old.  I didn't realize.  I'm tweeting now.  I wrote, fuck, I'm wrong.  No, that's not the Jarred Rock.  It's the Hard Rock.  My nervous fingers.  The Jarred Rock.  They're going to let us squeeze some more people in, I'm hearing?  I'm hoping so, yeah.  All right.  So if you're in the area, there's a pretty good chance you'll get in.  Yeah, if you're in the area, pop on in. 
[01:08:00]  Have fun.  Whatever.  We're going to have Kurt Metzger joining us.  Yes, Kurt.  Kurt will be there.  Is Kurt outside the studio?  I just saw him.  Yes.  Well, we're now walking down.  Are we going to take a car?  Huh?  What?  What happened?  I'm a fancy man.  I walk.  Yeah?  You're going to walk?  Yeah, it's nice out.  Maybe stop at Starbucks, get some coffee.  Yeah, it's nice out.  Uh-huh.  It's nice out.  What, we're going to leave now?  We should shortly, yeah. 
[01:08:30]  We should.  Should we say hi to Kurt over here or no?  We'll just bring him over.  Kurt.  Kurt, we should be on the air before 8 o'clock there at the latest.  Yeah.  Yeah, we only got two hours.  What's up, Kurt?  Hey, man.  There he is.  Yeah, we should kind of leave.  We're just heading over to a weird time.  Yeah, I just wanted to say hi to him.  Oh, you got a little badge?  Hey, man.  Save me a book.  Hey, guys.  Do we have to put our badges on?  I just heard you say you're a fancy man.  He is.  Fancy schmancy.  Main C.  Yeah, it's a fancy man.  What do you mean?  You're not walking?  I was thinking of just taking a car over there, you know, if I can sit down, set up, have 
[01:09:00]  a Bloody Mary.  Show up like a rock star.  It's a prerequisite.  If I'm going to broadcast from a bar, I'm probably going to have a drink.  What's this for?  I don't even have to drive home, which is cool.  We don't know what this is for, Kurt.  Oh.  This is, I don't know.  This is just.  I really don't know what this is.  This is just.  I know it's our show and all, but we have no idea.  This is just, yeah, going out.  Yeah.  All right.  On a Thursday morning. 
[01:09:30]  They've been obsessed with us doing something, so we said, okay, we'll do something.  So we're doing something today.  Cool.  Yeah.  It'll be fun, though.  Just come down.  Forget that RSVP nonsense.  Fucking show up.  Complicate everything.  We got to put it right on.  We'll go to the website and go online.  Who the fuck does that?  Just come down.  Every day.  Holy shit.  Every day is something. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah, you got to go.  Backslash.  Sirius XM.  Backslash.  Forward slash.  Yes, I'll attend.  Where are you from?  Kalamazoo, Michigan.  Why doesn't that register with you?  How does nobody know that's going to happen?  Holy fucking shit.  Shit.  Just come down.  It'll be fun.  They actually sent us yesterday, good news, over a thousand people replied to the RSVP.  And we're trying to tell these guys that, yeah, but they're signing up from all over  the country.  And it's a Thursday morning.  Just because they could. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah, yeah.  They're not going to take Thursday and Friday off and fly to New York.  And Jimmy tried to explain this to these idiots.  I sat outside and I told a couple people, you got to do it.  Just come down.  Don't complicate.  It's a fucking live event.  It's a Thursday morning.  It's not like afternoons where people can take off the day from work by 3.30 or 4 o'clock  or 5 and come see us.  This is where they're on their way to work.  What's the point of that, by the way, of RSVP for some?  Exactly.  Exactly.  What is the point?  There is no point. 
[01:11:00]  Well, Kurt, yeah.  What is the point?  You're not smart enough to understand that, obviously.  And we weren't smart enough to understand that.  Putting your own business card in a fishbowl in your house makes as much sense as off  the fucking RSVP.  Because it's the same commitment.  There's no commitment to that.  Right.  I get a park bench.  And we only want subscribers to come down.  Really?  That's what you want at a live event?  Just enough.  Holy shit.  Yeah, you can't hold them to it.  They can just go, yeah, I'll go.  Jesus Christ.  We're going to have a nice crowd. 
[01:11:30]  But, I mean, they were like, wow, a thousand people.  RSVP'd.  And all we're thinking is, like, you're just shutting down the people that didn't RSVP,  that are local, that hear about it and go like, oh, yeah, I'd like to come down.  Oh, RSVP.  I don't want to jump through fucking hoops to go.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's easy.  You just come down.  Fuck it.  No, they made it easy to come to this event.  Right, Jimmy?  Absolutely.  Because you always should have to go to a fucking website and RSVP and then get detail.  And I said, if you're going to do RSVP, you should have something special for people who 
[01:12:00]  do RSVP.  Like, if you RSVP, you get a little something extra.  So, there's an advantage.  But you can just come down.  If you're anything, anything with a website that I, like, when I go to the store and I  do that now, and they're like, could you just go to our site and say how we did?  And I'm almost like, yeah, and then take this code and then you'll get a dollar off  on your mail.  I'll give you a dollar and never say this to me again.  Yeah, yeah.  Lost me.  Lost me.  I love how they ask for your phone number and I go, no.  And they go, well, we don't know how to ring you up then. 
[01:12:30]  I'm like, all right, then.  So long.  And sometimes I leave the product right on the counter and walk out.  And then they go, oh, we're not going to, because I go, you're going to mail me shit.  And they're like, no, we're not.  But they either get it through the phone number or they ask for the actual address.  I'm like, why are you asking for this stuff?  That means you're going to mail me stuff.  I live in New York.  My mailbox is really small.  I can't handle junk mail.  And they swear they're not going to send anything.  I mean, my fucking mailbox is filled with junk.  I never give it.  I say no.  I say no every time, too. 
[01:13:00]  But now through the credit card, they got all your shit.  I was going to tell you, dude, you do the receipt to your smartphone, you know, they  give you electronic receipt.  I did that one time somewhere, dude.  I get spammed all day with 25.  And I don't even know how to take it off my stupid phone email.  I would never fucking do that.  But they actually told me, we don't know how to ring you up if you don't give us your phone  number.  I'm like, oh, well.  Get me a manager right now.  I'll find another store that'll figure it out.  Is this like, what?  What is this?  What's this?  No, I'm just looking at the images from when? 
[01:13:30]  Fantasy sports.  What's going on?  No, no.  I see.  Because there's the fantasy football thing going on after this.  So I want to know how much of an absolute steamroller inconvenience this is going to  be for us when they bring all that in.  Well, this is what, that's what it's going to, that's last year's.  See, see, here's what I'm thinking also.  There's going to be, see, we're used to doing a show, right?  And we walk into the hard rock.  If we do a show from the hard rock.  Yeah.  And we got the dressing rooms. 
[01:14:00]  We got this.  We got the backstage.  We got the stage area.  This.  Are we going to be like when they put the opening band in the front where the lead singer is?  No, no, no.  And like all the rest of the band is, their equipment's covered by a sheet and it's giant  like Motley Crue fucking band.  And we got like the little drum kit in front and.  Oh, no.  And they jab us on the PA.  Oh, no.  You know, I've been in bands.  I know how this works.  Oh, no.  We should head over there right now.  So we get there.  We should head over. 
[01:14:30]  Let's just get this over.  All right.  I'm joking.  I really am kidding.  And that was funny.  Yeah, but I'm kidding.  Let's just get this over.  I'm happy we're doing a live event.  Let's see.  It'll be fun.  We got fucking something planned and it'll be fun.  It's a nice day out.  And let's just fucking just come over there.  We'll have fun either way.  All right.  Yeah.  Let's go.  See you there.  We'll see it.  We'll see you at the hard rock in a half hour.  Don't be confused.  It's going to be a little best of or something.  43rd.  I'm sorry.  43rd and Broadway.  I can't believe I Twittered the wrong thing.  So my apologies.  What a dope I am. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, boy.  That's where the fantasy is.  Oh, yeah, sure.  Am I on that list still or are they officially taking me off?  You're off.  You're off.  You're off.  You're out.  I got a lot of press out of it.  You're out.  I got a lot of press for doing nothing.  That you were going to be there and be involved and then it's like, nope.  All right.  Let's get the fuck out of here.  All right.  See you soon.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Live from the Hard Rock Cafe in Times Square.  Times Square is moments away.  In the meantime, here's the worst of the walkover. 
[01:15:30]  Hosted by Primetime, Sam Roberts.  Hey, it's live event day, everybody.  I'm Sam Roberts.  Opie and Anthony are on their way to the Hard Rock Cafe.  As we speak, we're going to be broadcasting live from the Hard Rock literally in minutes.  I don't know what's going to happen.  Apparently, we're going to be doing some staff stand-up comedy.  But in the meantime, and yes, I am nervous about it.  I'm not even somewhat prepared.  I can't even speak.  In the meantime, we used to be able to broadcast live walkovers. 
[01:16:00]  That's where they're walking.  They're walking.  Can you believe it?  Stars of the caliber of Opie and Anthony are right now walking to the Hard Rock Cafe here  in New York City in Times Square.  When we were on K-Rock and broadcasting on XM at the same time, we used to broadcast the  walk from one studio to the other.  The studios were right by each other.  And we had the technology to actually, we were on the third floor or the fifth floor, maybe  the fifth floor, of a building very close to the CBS building. 
[01:16:30]  And that's where we broadcast out of when we were only on XM.  And we hung antennas out of the window and built a hot dog cart that allowed us to broadcast  live from the streets of New York City as we did the walkover.  Now, that technology simply is not an option for us anymore.  Now that we're at SiriusXM, the Hard Rock Cafe is much further away than any distance that  we traveled during the walkover.  And we're on the 36th floor of a building, which is far, far farther for a signal to travel 
[01:17:00]  through satellites and what have you.  So we can't do the walkover.  We figured that while you're waiting for ONA to get to the Hard Rock and start the live  show, we would do the best of the walkover.  Going over some of the best things that happened in that era that we call, well, the walkover.  We're going to start with a staple.  This became the number one ongoing bit of all walkovers. 
[01:17:30]  It was the Rich Voss Comedy Tour.  Anytime Voss was in and we did a walkover, we literally would just have him go into a  Starbucks, a restaurant, wherever he could, any public place, and just do a few minutes  of stand-up comedy.  Just welcome the people that were having their breakfast to a free stand-up comedy show.  It was really our way of giving back to the community that has given us so much.  It's Rich Voss. 
[01:18:00]  And this was at a restaurant called Rue 57.  It's a fairly upscale restaurant.  A lot of business people hobnobbing there in the morning.  It was about 9 o'clock in the morning and Rich Voss invaded to do stand-up comedy.  It's the Rich Voss Comedy Tour at Rue 57 on the worst of the walkover.  It's the worst of the walkover.  Let's do some retro.  Retro Rich Voss today at Rue 57.  You know, because, I mean, if you come to college, it's all new material, but, you  know, at Rue 57, it's a tough crowd. 
[01:18:30]  Ladies, come see a free show.  Nice talking to you.  They couldn't be bothered with you.  Oh.  Look at this.  Security watching security.  All right.  Who's going to introduce me, though?  I need an intro.  I think, um, Keith.  What, they got the AC?  Are they even?  Oh, there's people eating.  Oh, yeah.  I got to do it over here on this side.  Oh, good.  They're facing me.  Yeah, but, uh, I think we got to walk in the front door.  Should I introduce myself? 
[01:19:00]  See if that door is open.  Should I open for you?  Just see if...  Yeah.  You want to introduce me?  Just walk in and go, ladies and gentlemen.  Your first act tonight, today.  All right.  Bonnie will intro.  What did he say, don't do it?  Oh, well, we'll do it over here.  All right.  Bonnie will intro Rich Voss at Rue 57.  Oh, my God.  This is so embarrassing.  Oh, wait.  Here, Bonnie.  Grab, uh, grab Rich's mic and then you can hand it to him.  You got to be nice and loud.  Wait, wait.  Let our audience go in there, first of all.  This is so embarrassing.  Whoever wants to check out the quick three-minute comedy set from Rich Voss. 
[01:19:30]  I can't watch.  It's one of those things so embarrassing, you can't watch it.  We get paid to do this, Dave.  Hey, it's a living, right?  Oh, this is horrible.  The manager just told me to keep it clean.  Oh, he just...  Keep it clean.  All right.  The manager, who's a real...  Oh, don't you get it when they do that?  Well, the manager's a big fan of the Opie and Anthony show and he told Rich just to keep  it clean.  That's...  All right.  Uh, Bonnie.  You ready?  Tell Bonnie to introduce you.  I think everyone that's going in is in there.  Rich thinks he's hanging out backstage before he's going on. 
[01:20:00]  Go now?  Yeah.  Ladies and gentlemen, your first comedian this morning from Last Comic Standing, please  welcome Richard Voss.  Yeah.  Wow.  Hey, how we doing?  Voss.  It's good to see you guys.  We're going to do a little show because my career is not going...  This is how pathetic my life is.  I owe my eight-year-old six dollars for Girl Scout cookies and I'm dodging her.  She calls me and tries to disguise her voice, but I know it's her to go, hello? 
[01:20:30]  Is Daddy home?  Not bad.  Sir, I'm doing a show you can watch.  Give me a few minutes, all right?  What's your name?  Newman.  Are you two married?  How...  Unfortunately, I got a car and I'm not like the black guys.  I'll leave...  Well, anyhow.  Look, don't get upset, all right?  Turn on BET Comic View and watch black comics tricks, white people for an hour, all right?  White people, crazy.  They pay taxes.  You know what I'm saying?  Loosen up. 
[01:21:00]  We had the girl turn her back on me.  What country are you guys from?  Where are you guys from?  Oklahoma?  There's a nice little Oklahoma pub you might want to go to on 168th and Amsterdam.  It's called Run Whitey Run.  I'm killing it.  They're loving me.  This is the best crowd I've worked in a while.  How you doing, sir?  Do you work here?  What's your name?  What's that?  Maurice, what was Lincoln like as a president?  How old are you?  I love to see you having sex. 
[01:21:30]  Did I have an orgasm or break my hip?  Look at this waitstaff.  It looks like the United Nations is meeting here.  How you guys doing?  Wait, what country are you from?  Bangladesh.  Do you know a guy named Frank?  I love Bangladesh.  Whenever I played Risk, that was the first country I'd take.  Right into Bangladesh.  You live here now?  It's great.  You don't have to walk down to the river to do your laundry?  Nothing on that one. 
[01:22:00]  Come on.  They're from Bangladesh.  Look at dirt crack.  This is the best that I've had in a while.  Anyhow, folks, I got to run.  We just wanted to do a few minutes.  If you're in town tonight, come to Caroline Cedar Show.  Sir, you can get in free.  And we're giving out stool softeners.  Okay?  You guys were the best eight people I've ever worked to.  Thank you.  I can't believe he killed.  Come on.  I'm pissed.  That pisses me off that he did so well. 
[01:22:30]  He called it Bangladesh.  You bastard.  Where's Bangladesh?  Bangladesh.  I hate that he did well.  Eight people.  And you had him.  And they were all turned around watching.  Oh, you had them all.  Oh, God.  Oh, is that disturbing me that you actually killed in a restaurant?  Now we got to get disturbed to do a set in there.  I imagine.  Yeah, that'll wake him up.  Oh, yeah, the acapella thing right here.  I'm going to go tell the manager to come down to Caroline's.  Hold on.  All right.  Thanks, Rich.  That was great. 
[01:23:00]  Oh, Jesus.  That was all right.  Yeah, he did.  I've seen him do worse than that at real comedy clubs.  Right, right.  Bangladesh.  Bangladesh.  Yeah, Bangladesh.  Bangladesh.  Only Rich.  I'd love to look at a map if Rich wrote it.  The worst of the walkover.  Hey, it's Sam Roberts.  Yes, this is the worst of the walkover.  This is a very short show, though.  Don't tune out.  We're going to be back live with Opie and Anthony.  They're on their way to the hard rock right now.  But in the meantime, we're playing some of the worst of the walkover, an era that we all miss. 
[01:23:30]  John Cena, former WWE champion, legend in the wrestling business,  and very clean cut, at least on television.  That is until he came to the walkover here on the Opie and Anthony show  because he was involved in the John Cena nut kicking.  Yes, on the streets of New York City, right there on 57th Street, a public sidewalk.  Everyone's going to work, and John Cena is kicking men in the testicles. 
[01:24:00]  It's the John Cena nut kick here on the worst of the walkover.  Remember, Opie and Anthony will be live from the Hard Rock Cafe in minutes.  The worst of the walkover.  All right, listen.  Everyone else all right?  Anybody else?  Everyone's cool?  All right.  We might get these two to kick each other.  Let her kick them in the balls.  Wait.  You're going to do that?  You'll let her kick you in the balls?  You won't do it.  You won't do it.  How about just a little tap?  No, you won't do it. 
[01:24:30]  A little kick in the nuts.  Wow.  Come on.  It'll be fun.  First of all, she's beautiful, so it'd be a privilege to get kicked in the nuts by a chick  this hot.  That's going to be tough call because she got healed.  That'll be fun, though.  I'll probably leave her hurt.  How about she just kind of stomps on it a little bit?  Yeah, I mean, I'm just...  Not like a tease.  You know, that would be nice.  I'm just judging the book by its cover, but I mean...  Get on the sidewalk.  You probably don't have much there anyway.  We're professionals.  We'll make sure this doesn't hurt that much.  Jimmy, this girl's going to stomp on this guy's balls.  I'll hold the magazines. 
[01:25:00]  This guy is...  If you give him a good kick to the wickets, I promise we'll...  He's enchanting this guy.  All right, hold on.  What are we doing?  A kick?  You ready?  Don't kick him.  Wait, wait.  You going to do a kick?  Dude, what's going on in your pants right there?  Wait, let me see.  He's probably got a hard on thinking he's going to get kicked in the balls.  He does.  He's got a little something going on.  You got a little wood?  I don't know.  You're sporting a little wood there?  Do you want her to stomp on your balls or kick you in the balls?  Yeah, what do you want?  Just like a light...  Are you good for a light one?  All right.  Now, wait, wait, wait. 
[01:25:30]  All right, here we go.  You got to remember this.  Just make like he's giving you a lot of shit.  We were talking about role-playing this morning.  He's giving you a lot of shit, right?  Jimmy, mic him for us, please.  Okay.  He's giving you a lot of shit.  He throws out a racial epithet at you.  Oh, yeah.  Now you got it.  He's standing there.  Wait a minute.  Why does he just do the racial epithet?  Oh, really?  You want to roll for it like a movie scene? 
[01:26:00]  You're about to get kicked in the nuts.  Are you an actress?  I'd be a little pissed.  Are you an actress?  No, not yet.  You want to be an actress?  Yeah.  I can see how you've been an actress, so we can do a scene here.  Now, what did it tell you throwing out, you know, a racial epithet?  You okay with receiving that for this part?  Oh, okay.  And you okay with saying it?  So, like, see black people, I think they suck.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Black people are black.  Here's the line.  Here's your line.  I see Jamaican.  Let me whisper in your ear what the line is.  All right.  Say, fuck you, nigger bitch. 
[01:26:30]  Okay, you got it?  All right?  Oh, no.  Now, and then you respond by going, oh, yeah?  And then, bam, kick him in the nuts.  All right.  All right?  You got your lines?  Wait, scene.  Who's got the?  I got the two magazines.  Hold on.  Wait a second.  All right.  All right.  Yeah, let's mark this.  Racial epitaph followed by kick straight to the boys' hatchel.  All right?  Take one.  There you go.  Okay, you.  Hey, this guy's done a movie or something.  And action. 
[01:27:00]  No, you can't cover up like that.  You're a numbskull.  Wait, wait, John.  Come in here.  Take two.  Okay, you guys are the shits.  Wait till I say action.  Racial epitaph followed by swift kick to the balls.  Take two.  And no, you dummy.  He's just marking the scene.  Would you just fucking show up and actually act like what's fucking going on?  You're really bringing this production down.  Look, you don't say a word till I say action.  Where the fuck did we find this guy?  Hold on.  And you're smiling too much when you say it.  After action. 
[01:27:30]  You're angry with him.  Racial epitaph followed by fucking kick to the nugget bag.  Congratulations.  Take three.  All right.  Remember now, you're angry.  And action.  Screw you, you nigga bitch.  I would have got him a lot better than that.  You were generous.  He's down.  You were generous.  He's down.  I mean, you put the toe right in there.  I would have got him a lot better than that.  No, he got it good, man.  Yeah, wait a minute. 
[01:28:00]  And then the follow-up hug for the entertainment.  She missed the line.  She didn't say, oh, yeah.  How did that feel?  We got to do it again.  You did miss your line.  We got to do it.  I had to be the worst kick ever.  We got to do it one more time.  She didn't say, oh, yeah.  Yeah, but she missed her line.  You kind of liked it, though, didn't you?  You kind of liked it.  Oh, it was okay.  Yeah, we got to do it one more time.  One more time?  One more time.  She missed her line.  That's why.  Yeah, she missed her line.  Ladies and gentlemen, step up if you want to see a guy get kicked in the nuts.  This guy's going to get kicked straight in the balls.  Remember, you're angry. 
[01:28:30]  You're really angry.  And you just go, oh, yeah?  That's your line.  Oh, yeah.  And now your line, very angry.  Okay, you want to mark it?  And I'll call action.  After action.  Racial epitaph followed by, oh, yeah.  Followed by really, really hard kick to the balls.  Take four.  And action.  Fuck you, you dirty skank.  Oh, yeah.  See, that was a good one.  You got a little attitude on you.  That was a good one.  Oh, God.  Yeah, he's rolling. 
[01:29:00]  He's on the ground.  Yep.  How did that one feel?  I think he even broke a little sweat.  That was a kick in the air.  Dude, but you didn't use the racial epithet.  You did.  You got to use the racial epithet.  But it's acting, so it's okay.  You got to follow the script here.  You can't just.  Follow the script, okay?  This is an indie film.  This is the last time.  This is the take, man.  Feel it, okay?  You're angry.  You can't smile when you say it.  I mean, you're not writing your own stuff.  And you're pissed, you know?  Oh, yeah.  Wham.  And you give it to him.  I should have done a pretty good job. 
[01:29:30]  Let's mark a take three.  You got your line.  You got your line.  You got your line.  I mean, really give it to him this time.  Don't hold anything back.  I mean, I really think from the production standpoint, you're holding a lot back.  You really got to get into it.  Okay.  Is that all right?  Okay.  Here we go.  What do you feel about sleeping with the guy who marks the picture here?  I got a chance?  Yeah.  All right.  We'll talk afterwards.  I rocked.  After action.  After action.  Fracial epitaph.  Followed by, oh, yeah.  Followed by, just fucking kick him in the nuts.  Take five.  Okay.  All right.  And remember your lines.  Motivation, your anger, and action. 
[01:30:00]  Fuck you, you nigga bitch.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, he got it.  Get him from behind.  You missed.  There you go.  Drop the elbow.  Something.  You backed off.  You backed away.  Why'd you back off?  Let's just take it from the kick.  Oh.  Yeah, we could edit the kick in.  Just from the kick.  We'll edit the kick in.  We'll fix it in post.  Just close your eyes.  No, honestly.  Just the kick.  All right.  Seriously, you got to be patient about this.  You got to stay open for it.  You know what I'm saying? 
[01:30:30]  Oh.  It was a knee.  Do we need a kick?  We need him.  He's doubled over.  Oh, he's doubled over.  Yes.  That was good.  That was very good.  Yeah.  All right.  And one more kick and go.  Which is, yeah.  Just one more kick.  One kick.  Last one.  Make it a good one.  Now stand up straight.  Don't back off.  Seriously.  One good kick.  He's got the glasses off.  Yeah.  Take his glasses off.  One good kick. 
[01:31:00]  No backing off now.  Just stay like that.  It won't hurt as much.  Yeah.  Stay just like that.  Just give him a swift pick.  Just go.  There you go.  Yeah.  Screw the line.  Just go for it.  All right.  And...  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!  I'm satisfied.  Oh, shit.  I heard that one.  I'm satisfied.  Oh, he went down.  Oh, damn.  I'm satisfied.  Wow.  God damn.  Wow.  Yeah.  It's tough.  Yeah.  Oh, that was a good one. 
[01:31:30]  I heard that.  Please don't try this at home.  We don't have to do any post sound.  Nothing.  I heard that.  No, no.  We don't even have to...  That was great.  Fix that sound in the post.  And they're hugging.  That's perfect.  Hey, you got a camera?  You want a picture with John Cena?  We even popped twitches.  That was great.  Thank you so much.  No camera, bro?  We'll talk after.  No camera?  Great scene.  All right.  Absolutely beautiful.  Wow.  That is a wonderful scene, man.  Fantastic.  Very good.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks for being a good sport, whoever you are.  Thank you so much.  He's not even a fan of the show, by the way.  You got a great kick on you. 
[01:32:00]  I like that.  All right.  Nice kick.  We're going to go upstairs now.  All right.  Very cool.  Thank you, everybody.  Thank you, guys.  Thank you.  Oh, that was funny, man.  That was hilarious.  All right.  We'll see you guys upstairs.  Hey, Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Hey, Norton.  Yeah.  This guy's back at the desk.  What's that?  Missing for a day.  What happened to the guy that was working? 
[01:32:30]  There was a guy working here.  Yesterday?  Yeah.  But now this is the guy that's usually here.  Where?  Right behind the desk.  Everyone see him?  He's right in front of you.  Do you see him?  I just see a ball of scrotum that somebody threw a tie on.  A bleeding ball of scrotum that somebody accidentally dropped a tie on.  I wonder why people always are putting ties on these disgusting items.  How did somebody remove the testes from the scrotum and keep it bleeding and then drop a tie on it?  Why would they do that?  Now, be nice. 
[01:33:00]  I'm going to be nice.  You be nice.  Okay.  Hello, sir.  Good morning.  Good morning, sir.  How are you today?  This fine day.  Another good day.  I'm going to be killed on Christmas Eve.  I hope you die on Christmas Eve.  See you upstairs.  I'm Sam Roberts.  We're literally going to cut this off.  I'm just waiting here before.  I'm going to have to go down to the hard rock myself.  But as soon as Opie and Anthony are live, we're just going to cut this off and go straight to them. 
[01:33:30]  So stay tuned because they're going to be live from the hard rock in just a few minutes.  In the meantime, it's the worst of the walkover, and we continue with New York radio legend John Montone joining us.  For those that don't know him, I'm sure you've heard his voice somewhere, even if you're not local to the New York area.  John Montone is probably the most famous man-on-the-street reporter in all of radio, maybe.  He's on 1010 Winds, the news station here in New York.  And he joined us one day when we were at K-Rock and did the walkover with us, commenting on everything he saw in New York City, giving us news teases live as they happen. 
[01:34:00]  Here he is, John Montone.  We may cut this off midway through.  I don't exactly know what the status is because I'm hosting this show.  But we'll be live with Opie and Anthony at the hard rock soon.  First, here's John Montone on the walkover.  The worst of the walkover.  Wow, wow, wow, wow.  Hey, we are on the air.  Isn't that great? 
[01:34:30]  For the XM portion of the program, Opie and Anthony Show.  We're standing out.  Well, you know where we are by now, right?  We're standing out on 57th Street, ready to make our trek over to XM, the XM Studios.  Now we're uncensored.  Yeah.  So, John, it's like your blog now.  I'm going to give my mic to John because we only have three mics.  We've only been asking.  The way it works over here is you have to ask for at least a year.  We've only been asking for eight months.  Yeah.  John, do you think we can scare some people? 
[01:35:00]  Either scare some people or maybe get a little information from the people that clean the stainless steel.  That seems like a story that would be something you would go for.  How would you approach the scaffold guy with the squeegee that is cleaning this building?  You know, here's a fellow right here.  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  John Montone with 1010 Wins Radio.  You know this stuff? 
[01:35:30]  They found out.  They did a study.  It can kill you.  And did your boss tell you about that?  We're doing it for 26 years.  It ain't killed me yet.  But yeah, how it would?  Really?  Yeah.  You don't like your job, do you?  I don't like life.  Really?  It sucks.  Oh, come on.  It's better than that.  Now you got me feeling bad.  Well, feel bad.  You deserve to feel bad.  Everybody should feel bad.  Actually, this can't kill you.  Yeah, it can.  But you know what can?  Q-tips.  They just did a study.  Q-tips.  People put them in their ear.  Do me a favor.  Talk to somebody who cares. 
[01:36:00]  I don't give them.  John, do you get that a lot?  Very often.  Very often.  Leave me alone.  You know, those are the ones I guess they cut out of the 1010 Wins segments when the people  tell John Montone to fuck off.  Thank you, sir.  Thanks, sir.  At least it's a nice day, right?  Excuse me.  Quick.  John Montone with 1010 Wins Radio.  They just did a study.  You know, people die from using Q-tips.  Do you ever?  Really?  Yeah, it's very scary now. 
[01:36:30]  I mean, a lot of people, they're finding them just dead.  That's a shame.  Yeah.  That's kind of aggressive.  Yeah, all the time.  Well, you're not going to anymore, right?  And she runs off.  She ran because there's a crowd gathered.  But it's amazing.  He gets them to stop.  Yeah.  He can't get anyone to stop.  We can't get anyone to even stop.  He knows how to cut them off.  He's the consummate professional.  John has a great, hey, hold it, whore, way of just jumping in front of the microphone.  I played linebacker in high school, believe it or not. 
[01:37:00]  I was bigger then.  Look at the front of his jeans, too.  He's packing.  Frightening.  John Montone's works.  We'll continue.  We might have to do a human interest story on what's in his pants.  Smuggling a boxing glove.  You notice how the people in New York, though, just really go about their business, and it's  only the tourists that...  They're not impressed with anything.  With anything.  It does not matter.  We have numerous times during this walk have had freak shows and marching bands and other 
[01:37:30]  things that should gather people's attention, but they just keep walking.  They've got somewhere to go.  They don't want to be bothered.  And now, more than ever, they seem so cut off from anything going on around them, because  look at all the pods just sticking in people's ears.  Now they don't have to look at you, because they look at the sidewalk.  They don't have to hear anything.  It's just amazing what this city has become.  So many people, yet everyone is enclosed in their own little pod. 
[01:38:00]  And there's a diner on 57th that Seinfeld eats in every morning.  People don't even look at them.  They just walk by, he sits there, you know.  If this was out in Jersey somewhere, everybody would be fighting to get his autograph, putting  their hands in his eggs.  No, not in New York.  And that diner?  The Broadway diner.  Right.  The Broadway or Brooklyn?  Brooklyn.  Oh, Christ, I'm having a really bad morning.  Brooklyn diner. 
[01:38:30]  I don't know what's wrong with me today.  Hi.  Hi.  How are you?  Hello.  What's up, guys?  Huh?  Oh, the motorcycle ride.  Oh, cool.  Yeah, we're going to talk about the WOW motorcycle ride when we get over to Ex-Am.  Keith the Cop is all set to go.  I think they're assembling at, what, like 6 in the morning outside Free FM?  Very nice.  We're crossing the street.  You want to have John Montone do a little something here, maybe?  Need to go by?  There you go.  Very large.  Isn't that one of the recalled strollers? 
[01:39:00]  Have you heard about that with 1010 Winds Radio?  They're recalling all these strollers?  I don't know.  But that's okay, because what year was this made in?  I don't know.  This one's okay, I think.  You have to check the bottom.  If you can go like that, it's okay.  If not, your kid will fold up like an envelope.  Our homeless friend is out there.  John could do a little time with the homeless guy.  Hey, Gary Sinise. 
[01:39:30]  Looked like him.  Hey, look, an Opie and Anthony little sticker on the back of that big bus.  Ah, we must be famous, Opie.  We're getting there, finally.  Jeez.  Who cares?  Must be time, almost time to get fired again, John.  Don't do that.  The second we start getting right up to that point where we feel,  hey, we're almost there.  The worst of the walkover.  Hey, sorry, we've got to cut that off. 
[01:40:00]  It's Sam Roberts, and we're about to go live.  The Hard Rock Cafe, Opie and Anthony's show.  They're ready to broadcast, so we bring it to you after this.  That's it for the worst of the walkover.  The Opie and Anthony's show, live from the Hard Rock Cafe in Times Square.  Coming up next on The Virus.  You've waited over two years for it to happen again.  And it's the Hard Rock Cafe.  This is just unbelievable.  Now, let's see how long it takes for something to go horribly wrong. 
[01:40:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony show, live from the Hard Rock Cafe in Times Square, New York City.  So we've got to sober.  Oh, boy.  The curtain's going up.  Live from the Hard Rock Cafe.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  All right.  What's going on, everyone?  Yeah.  All right.  We got people.  That's nice.  Yeah.  Who's the girl with the big tits over there?  Uh, E-Rock. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, that was E-Rock?  Oh, I've got to get my eyes checked.  Hey, we're really sorry you guys couldn't drink.  We just found out.  But I'm sure that's what you wanted to do, is come down, have a good sober show.  Well, uh, you showed up.  That's good.  That's good.  Thanks.  That's a plus.  I remember last time we were here, what, 20 people showed up for our Halloween show?  That was, uh, embarrassing.  That was nice.  That was the last time I think we were even out. 
[01:41:30]  We did something here with Imus a while ago, too, didn't we?  Uh, yeah.  We talked to Imus on stage.  Stood on stage.  This is great.  They just stare at us.  Yeah.  Who are the fucking reserve people up front who didn't show up?  Sir, you're at a table with, uh, eight, eight, uh, empty chairs.  Why are you by yourself?  We need a mic in the crowd because we like talking to the people.  Uh, yeah.  Oh, there's, uh, there's Danny.  Young Danny Ross.  In shape Danny.  The new in shape Danny. 
[01:42:00]  Danny, to your right there, the first little sweetie there by himself.  Now, I'm just wondering why there's two empty tables up front.  There's nobody here yet, dude.  No, I know that those eight people aren't there, sir.  That's why.  We can figure that much out.  That's why I use the adjective empty.  Somebody's got to sit.  Oh.  I, I, I've just been informed that they're reserved for us.  They're reserved for us?  Why?  So we can move people up and they can sit in the front row again.  Yeah.  Oh, there you go.  Oh, there you go.  Yes. 
[01:42:30]  We want.  Okay, cool.  We want women in the front row.  That would be nice.  The two girls in the establishment.  That's, yes.  Some things never change, right?  That's great.  Victims number one and two.  Thank you for sitting up front.  We'll have the pool table brought out shortly.  We've reserved a pinball machine for you.  Wow.  Wow.  A rape joke 30 seconds into the live broadcast.  What a shock.  Oh, that's the 18-year-old with the big tits, by the way.  I recognize her.  What?  That's the 18-year-old with the big tits that we had on the couch of Zilchers two weeks ago. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, right.  You want to come up and say hi real fast?  Hi.  All right.  Good.  I'm so glad I went with that.  I have a front row seat.  Then go sit down, madam.  You're pointing at the chair.  It's empty.  Go ahead.  It says reserved.  We need women in the front row with skirts so they can flash us.  Yeah, that would be nice.  Opie's right.  A woman with a skirt.  If you have a skirt, you can sit in the front row.  Or a Scottish male.  We'll take that, too.  All right.  Slow down. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, do they think that was for our friends and family?  Is that what we're supposed to do?  Like, have our friends sit up there and look at us from fucking 10 feet away?  How awkward would that be?  Anybody who might fuck me, besides the company.  I'm kidding.  You know, Jim, that remark about that.  Yeah.  All right.  We shouldn't do that at a live event.  Come on, Jim.  Oh, there we go.  Some people are right.  Cool.  All right.  Oh, who's the man in the hat?  He's really straightening things out.  We have black listeners?  Looks like the guy from The Wire who worked in the rim shop.  Hey, O&A, welcome back.  Thank you. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  That's it.  It's the midget Cedric the Entertainer.  Oh, man.  That's funny.  Cedric the little person.  I'll set that one.  All right.  All right.  You're wearing the hat, though.  What about the hat?  Yeah.  My man.  You can face us, sir.  All right.  So now, are you guys together at that?  What's that, sir?  I miss you guys on K-Rock.  All right.  Well, we're here now.  We've been on K-Rock since 1984.  What are you fucking?  We got in trouble at K-Rock because we said woo-woo instead of hiney.  It's really edgy radio. 
[01:44:30]  That fucking place should be firebombed.  Not that I would encourage you to do that, but if somebody ran in yelling Allah Akbar,  I wouldn't stop them.  Does the guy even have Sirius XM, Jimmy?  Yeah, sir.  You got to get satellite radio.  Yeah, I'll get it.  I'm sure you will.  We've only been on it for seven years.  That was as convincing as when I'm fucking a girl and I go, yeah, I'll pull out.  That's cool.  That's cool.  By the way, our friend Kurt Metzger is here.  We didn't introduce Kurt. 
[01:45:00]  A lot of you guys know Kurt from the Ugly American cartoon.  Very funny comedian.  I'm sorry, Kurt.  We didn't.  Yeah, it was awkward to me.  We just panic in front of audiences.  Well, let's ask Kurt.  It's your first live event with us.  What do you think so far?  A lot of people came from that RSVP shit that we mocked earlier.  Well, yeah.  Yeah, you know what?  But there will be no apology to management.  Hell no.  Never an apology.  It's never an apology.  Yeah, that's very cool.  Everybody showed up.  Who else we got showing up here?  Patty, I think.  Where's stalker Patty?  Where is that dolt? 
[01:45:30]  She's going to sing some Amy Winehouse for us today, I hear.  Oh.  Yeah, hopefully with the same end result.  See that she drops dead.  There's stalker Patty, everyone.  Yes.  All right.  And by the way, can I apologize to anybody who is right now on 57th Street?  Dude, I've been coming here for years.  I've seen Motley Crue here, Priest.  We've done events here.  And I write, Opie and Anthony will be broadcasting live at the Hard Rock Cafe on 57th Street in 45 minutes. 
[01:46:00]  And then I retweeted, fuck, I'm wrong, 43rd and Broadway.  So my apologies to any of you outside on 57th Street.  We're here.  Yeah, the Hard Rock used to be there when Lennon would come down and actually give the memorabilia by himself.  All right.  See?  Ooh.  Pilot to Bombadier.  Pilot to Bombadier.  I also see Big A over there.  Big A!  Oh, wow. 
[01:46:30]  Big A.  The crowd just loves the Big A.  What's going on, Big A?  Nothing much.  Thank you, Dylan.  That's perfect.  Enjoying yourself?  Yes, I am.  That's the same view Lincoln had when he got shot in the head.  Big A, you look very good, though.  I mean, we know you're going to be out here a little later, which is a big part of this crowd just here to see you.  You look very...  How much weight have you lost?  A little over 100 now. 
[01:47:00]  Damn.  A little over 100 pounds.  Oh, look at the crowd.  That's right.  A round of applause for prostate cancer.  The listeners in general look thinner.  What's going on with the listeners?  I know.  It really is depressing.  I would actually fuck at least two of you.  Oh, shit.  I'm kidding.  You know, we could get Big A to start the festivities.  That would be really nice.  Big A, you want to start us off?  Big A, come up on stage here.  There you go.  What are we doing?  We're going to do news with Big A.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:47:30]  A staple of the show.  Just in case people aren't up to date on what's going on in the world.  Big A will help you out.  Big A.  Oh, that's good.  Oh, Jesus.  I hope there's no words in there he trips over clumsily, because that would be humiliating.  Damn, he looks different.  Yeah.  What the fuck, Big A?  It's cool.  Finally being able to get the good shirts.  Well, slow down.  I'll take a Dolph Sweet medium.  All right. 
[01:48:00]  Big A, well, welcome.  And how about you let us know what's going on?  Don't be nervous.  You're not nervous, are you?  No.  I'll get nervous.  No, not at all.  This is being broadcasted to a million people.  There's a lot of people watching.  And there's a lot of people here at the Hard Rock Cafe.  Look at all these signs that they put up, too.  They don't just do that.  Like, don't fuck this up.  Don't worry about the bright lights.  Yeah.  That show every flaw. 
[01:48:30]  Just relax.  I think Big A is going to do the big news stories of the summer, right?  Everyone's watching you.  Yes.  All right, here we go.  Big A with the news.  A Big A.  Good morning.  Be more confident.  Sorry.  Exactly.  Right now you're testifying like Casey Anthony's father.  Come on.  How about a little fucking chutzpah?  Yeah. 
[01:49:00]  A little Casey Anthony's brother.  Good morning, Hard Rock.  My name is Big A.  Big A.  And thanks.  And thanks.  So far so good.  Thanks for.  Oh, he'll get it.  He'll get it.  Thanks. 
[01:49:30]  It'll be noon, but.  Of course.  Come on, Big A.  No, he can't.  That's why we're doing this.  Thanks for.  Hopping by.  For this.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Holy shit. 
[01:50:00]  That's all we're up to is here.  It's crazy. 
[01:50:30]  I really do.  Come on, Big A.  You can do it.  Hold on.  Let Bobo.  Bobo will come out in a second.  Big A is just contemplating the next word  and realizing why did he not iron his pants since 1992.  Jesus, where do you store them in your glove compartment?  Sorry, Andrew.  I didn't mean to distract you. 
[01:51:00]  We're up to the first story?  We're not even on the first story yet.  That was the introduction.  Jesus.  All right, Big A.  That was the equivalent of welcome to News 11.  New York and most of the country suffered a...  was a effling heat wave last week  with temperatures. 
[01:51:30]  In the 90s, most of the week,  even breaking 100 at some points.  At least two people...  Stoned you to death?  Stoned you to death? 
[01:52:00]  Holy Christ, dude.  His impression of a boa constrictor.  Yeah, this guy's making his...  I forget.  I forget.  I get nervous. 
[01:52:30]  These two people...  Uh-oh.  He backed up.  Wow, is he having a tough time.  Oh.  Start over!  Start over!  I'm living in the metropolitan area  because of this...  us...  stunning temperatures. 
[01:53:00]  many sort...  many sort...  refuge...  inside...  and...  use...  egg-conditioners...  Egg...  additioners?  Egg...  conditioners...  Oh, well, fuck me running.  ...to remove this...  nice way to chill two hours, guys.  They're on to us.  Fuck, they're on to us.  Who says we don't prepare for live events? 
[01:53:30]  All right, we'll go from 8 to 9.45 with him reading this paragraph.  And we'll fucking...  And we'll fucking bring out Stalker Patty and call her an aunt for 30 seconds.  When they start yelling for Bobo, it's real bad.  Yeah.  All right, Big A, continue.  Yeah, sorry, Big A.  All right, we didn't mean that.  Oh, boy.  I didn't mean it.  Don't...  Don't pay attention to that, dude.  This is great, the whole thing.  To...  Remove...  This... 
[01:54:00]  You know the genius that is performed on this stage?  Well, this ain't it.  Bring out the Hogan!  You're losing them, Andrew.  That's what that is, yes.  It's called losing the crowd, yes. 
[01:54:30]  Halfway through the first story.  Oh, my God.  Maybe we can just do one story and then something else and come back to it.  You got a little ambitious having, like, three stories on here.  Yeah, we really did.  He's got this.  We should have just had you do the weather.  All right, go ahead.  You got this, Big A.  Go.  And go.  To...  To...  To...  To...  To remove the...  Stuttering pool from the stage? 
[01:55:00]  Sweat from their bodies.  Temperatures...  Finally...  Try wiggling your phone!  Temperatures...  Finally...  It's amazing.  We're all annoyed that we're all annoyed that a stutterer can't say words.  Burn him!  We really are assholes.  Like, we didn't mean to exploit it.  Go ahead.  Just continue.  Just continue.  Temperatures...  Finally...  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  This is a big one.  Get to it! 
[01:55:30]  Stabilize...  Oh, boy.  This is a big one.  Get to it!  Stabilize...  Oh, boy.  This is a big one.  Stabilize...  Stabilize...  Stabilize...  Stabilize...  Stabilize...  Stabilize...  Over the weekend...  Which is...  Happen...  Yeah.  In the right direction.  Oh!  A big A.  A big A!  A big A!  A big A!  We'll do more later.  Good job!  Bye-bye, a big A! 
[01:56:00]  A big A!  Oh, yeah!  He's gonna read three stories, but fuck it.  Holy shit.  Wow.  That was a weather report.  Just to recap the news of the day.  Yeah.  First news, hello, my name's Big A  It was hot  Yeah, that was pretty much  That wraps it up in a nice little package  So what do you think we should do?  Maybe we should have somebody  What's that, sir?  Well, no, virus wouldn't  Oh, no, that's the show star  Although I do like the fact that you model your hairstyle  After Frankenstein, that's really nice 
[01:56:30]  Holy shit  I'll take the undead, please  I think we should start staff stand-up  I agree  Oh, we should have had Andrew say that  Oh, yeah, you want Andrew to do that?  Oh, well  Now, who do you think  Oh, we have a hat?  We have a hat  We need a hat or something  This is Jim Norton's idea  I think it's a great idea  That we're going to have the staff do stand-up  Three minutes each, right?  Yeah, I think so, if they can, sure  Three of the longest minutes of their life  Give them a chance 
[01:57:00]  I'll just yell at them  Because they're all funny dudes  They've been toiling  Don't you think after Big A  They're all going to do great?  Yeah, see, that was a good opener, I guess  Do we have a hat, Travis, or no?  We couldn't get a hat  We just have a hand  Oh, there's one  Talk about a fucking low-budget operation, guys  We couldn't swing the hat  So we'll have one without lice, sir  Oh, Danny's hat, all right  All right  Now, how many  Travis, everyone  Hold on, let me put the names here  Oh, Travis  Let me see 
[01:57:30]  How many names are there?  A load of personality right there  Walking out on stage  Is Kenny going to be the emcee for this?  Club Soda Kenny?  Oh, yeah, maybe  So Club Soda Kenny should pick a name  Club Soda Kenny, everyone  Oh, boy  He's got his casual wear on today, by the way  You're very lucky  Yes  To see Kenny in his casual wear  Look at this monster  Yeah, there's no  Good comic  Hey, Kenny, remember last time you were up on stage?

[01:58:30]  And of course, we're going to start off with a joke  Oh, boy  Oh, we didn't expect this  There was a woman standing in a crowded elevator  And a guy got on and elbowed her in a tit  And a guy apologized saying  If your heart is as soft as your tit, you'll forgive me  And the lady said  If your cock is as hard as your elbow, I'm in room 213  So let's keep the show going 
[01:59:00]  Atta boy  Leave him laughing  Leave him laughing  He knows all too well  You're really going to love our first act  He's the lovable Roland  Oh, yeah  Roland  Roland  We should talk to Roland before he does his stand-up  Don't you think?  Now, Roland  Hi, Roland  They can take the mic out of the stand or no  If they want to  Yeah  Hello  Hi, Roland 
[01:59:30]  Hello  Are you all right?  No  Are you a little nervous?  I'm scared  Aw, Roland  Aw  Alright, go ahead  Have fun, Roland  So, you guys are the ones that fuck out  12.95 a month  Welcome  See, this is the problem we have  I don't mean to interrupt your act  But this is the problem we have  You might not be able to understand Roland  Which, I guess in comedy  Is probably a bad thing  Yeah, it's terrible  Alright, just  I wanted to go to a pro on that  Go out to that  Don't be afraid of these fuckers 
[02:00:00]  Yeah, yeah  There you go  There you go  Here's Roland  Alright, Roland  Now, and then just slow down a little bit  Because I had no idea what the hell you just said  Do you want to start over, Roland?

[02:00:30]  I know, I'm scared  Oh, okay  I'm sorry, Roland  Go ahead, we should have  Yeah, sorry, Roland  In a recent study by Harvard Medical  They said obesity is the number one killer  As I look around, I say bullshit  I've been trying to lose weight recently  I know  I took big AIDS weight  But I just started dressing like a runner  That's about it so far  Well, Travis actually is the thinnest one of the whole staff 
[02:01:00]  But I can't do his diet, I've all come  I tried  Wait, wait, hold on  Actually, Danny right now is passed out  Because he made Travis a protein shake of cum  Oh  Getting personal  Too much with the tag  Yeah, actually  Troy Kwan actually believes that the end of the world is next year  Troy believes the Mayans  Well, he believes that more than he'll get a raise this year  Is this a company meeting? 
[02:01:30]  When has Hooters restaurant become the white trash of American restaurants?  I guess to qualify to work there, you have to have a C-section  I think  That's fucking great  That's all right  I'm going to steal half of these  Yeah, recently took a date to McDonald's downtown  They have a new fine dining restaurant  Where you actually have to get reservations  And then they'll take your order  And everything 
[02:02:00]  Does McDonald's now want us to get pussy anymore?  No, no, don't get mad at Roland  I didn't understand that one either  Because that implies that you would get pussy  If you just took a chick to McDonald's  And it was quick  Yeah, that was a dick in the ass  That was a huge dick in the ass  Here's a New York truck for you guys  I love how people say they live on the Upper West Side  When they actually live on 200th, 30th, and Lexington  If you live around the corner from the ghetto

[02:03:30]  Yeah, good job  Roland, uh, obviously  First time ever  Nice job, Roland  Obviously going to his professional comedian friends helped  Yep  That's what we're here  That's what the rumor is, by the way  That he went to his professional comedian friends  And they wrote his jokes  If nobody does as well, remember, he cheated  That's all right  Right, right  Wait, Roland  Oh, you want to defend yourself?  Roland, not taking any guts  Roland, yes  I did not cheat  I just used the skills  Look at the  Oh, no  Oh, no  Where's Mars? 
[02:04:00]  He's here  His spirit  Uh-oh  Roland  You didn't do the cat hiss  There you go  Oh, shit, look out  Thank you, Roland  Good job, my Roland  Really good, Roland  Bob Soda County  Go up there and host, Gray Buttons  All right, so far, so good  We're going to keep the show rolling  Someone's getting confident  There was an airplane that was about to crash  And a female passenger  She jumps up and she announces 
[02:04:30]  If I'm going to die  I want to die feeling like a woman  And she starts ripping off all her clothes  And she says  Is there a man on board  That can make me feel like a woman?  And a guy jumps up  He rips off his shirt  And he goes  Here, iron this  Kenny!  He should have had to put it in the washer or something  You're really going to love our next performer 
[02:05:00]  Check out his website  NotSam.com  Oh, shit!  He's watched the new Rebecca Black video 42 times  And his cock drips at the end of it  Here's prime time Sam Roberts  Woo!  Yeah!  Thank you  Thank you  So, a lot of you may or may not already know this 
[02:05:30]  But I was circumcised  When I was 19 years old  19 years old  And it left me with the belief that  Every baby  The minute they come out of the womb  Must be circumcised  Male or female  It doesn't matter  Or at least male  Because to live your life  With the knowledge  Of what it's like to be circumcised  Is something that you would never wish on anyone  And it is an excruciating 
[02:06:00]  Painful and humiliating procedure  I mean  What they do is  Is this like the torpedo of truth  Tor of Sam Roberts  They're cutting off the top of your penis  They're taking a knife  And slicing a piece of your dick off  But it's something that we have to do  Because otherwise we get confused with cavemen or Europeans  Which is just  Just awful  So I was 19 when I was circumcised 
[02:06:30]  I was a freshman in college  Getting ready for spring break  Every dude that I knew  Was getting ready to go to a tropical island  Where they could date rape girls on the beach  But me, no  I was headed back to my parents' house  To have a cosmetic surgery performed on my penis  Bobo, you can relate  Thank you, Bobo  His was for urinary problems  Crowd work  So I had the procedure done 
[02:07:00]  And it went as well as a procedure could go  Like that  And I looked at myself  After I left the doctor's office  He had left me swollen and bandaged  Which at least flaccid was impressive  But it was what it was  And I looked at the bandage  And I noticed that between my penis and the bandage  Was what looked like  A layer of hardened gel  That was purple  Padding, obviously  It was protecting me  And I felt protected  So I went  I went a couple days  Healed up 
[02:07:30]  The bandage  Evaporated in the bathtub  Like it should  But the padding  Was still  On my penis  Yeah, it's coming  Hold on  He's talking about  Cock surgery  Give him a second  It's coming  So the padding  Was still there  So I'm sitting in the bathtub  And I start picking at it  To get it off  Peeling at it  To get it off  Where's Big A?  Dude  He'll be on  Wow  And it won't come off 
[02:08:00]  I've prodded it  And I look down at my shaft  And I see that it's still swollen and purple  And that's when I realized the padding was me  And I was trying to peel back my own shaft  That's not funny  It is what it is  I heard her  It is what it is  By the way  Is this what he does  Between like 10 and 11? 
[02:08:30]  Hope not  I like the fact that Sam is just telling a really sad story  It's called  Stand up  It is what it is  It is what it is  It is what it is  Sam Roberts  It is what it is  On HBO  You have a few more seconds Sam  Get to one more  Luckily  Did your mom take care of it Sam?  My mother  My mother did not take care of it  She suggested the procedure 
[02:09:00]  But she didn't take care of it  Luckily my shaft  Remained somewhat intact  And I was able to recover  For the next couple weeks  I spent my time avoiding erections  And getting hit in the nuts  Which usually go hand in hand anyway for me  So it wasn't that difficult  And I developed this idea  That was pretty funny by the way  That deserves something  You talked over a little bit  That was pretty funny  I've lost him already  It's what you know  Not totally  Confidence  They are listening  Dripping with confidence 
[02:09:30]  Or flop sweat  This isn't what I did on my summer vacation show anyway  But it left me with the idea that  Every baby needs to be circumcised  When they're born  Because  You never know  When you're going to end up  With a retarded kid  Who wants to do it later in life  A nice hand for Sam Roberts  Or Tracy Morgan  With that  Wow  And you know what  He's right  They should all be snipped  When they're babies  Alright Sam 
[02:10:00]  Sam Roberts everyone  Yeah see that wasn't that bad  What a set of balls  We're going to take a quick break  We're going to take a quick break  And I'm timing everybody  Sam went over a little bit  But I started late  It was worth it though  He went over at 30 seconds  Well sometimes when you're telling a true story  He's being autobiographical  Which I respect  But sometimes you've got to get to it  Just a little faster  Talk about yourself  Yeah absolutely  Kenny take us to break will you  In your special way  Yes

[02:17:00]  Diabetes  I guess Bobo wants to do the one man band for everyone real fast  Oh wow  Before we get into more comedy  He brought props and everything  Jesus  He brought one frying pan  He brought one frying pan  He brought one frying pan  Classic one man band  Hopefully it's banging it against the plate in your head  No I still got something to make the sound  What's that?  I still got enough to get the right sound  You don't understand that banging a plastic water bottle on metal 
[02:17:30]  Is not the same as banging two metal things together  I only had one old pan  But it's your bit  So bring a new pan  Yeah  Your mother doesn't have two pans in the house?  She was having fits over me bringing a new ones  The expensive pans she was having fits  All right Bobo dropped his pan  Danny knocked it down by accident 
[02:18:00]  I think  I think  I think quickly we'll have Bobo do a circle around the hard rock cafe  And do his one man band  One man band?  Yes  And then out onto Broadway  And in front of a fucking Mack truck  Hopefully  Hopefully  Or a Kenworth  This is going out over the radio  Just walking around  Hitting a plastic bottle against

Where's Club Soda County? 
[02:20:00]  With the one man band  I got to say  I was afraid it would be an anti-climax  But  Watching a retarded guy  Run around with a fucking pot  And a plastic bottle  Is really all it's cracked up to be  Alright  Oh my god  That was a disaster  Well Kenny's picking another name  On the staff of stand-up comedians  Alright Kenny  That was where three strikes  And American  Got talent  Oh  Boom  Boom  He tried so hard  Boom  Sir  Wait we should give him a chance

That was meant?  What happened?  That was where  We heard you!  Back to Club Soda Kenny 
[02:21:00]  I like that guy  Yes  Continuing with the funny  One night I went to visit Troy  When he was DJing at Club 675  And I saw this drunk guy  Staggering towards the bathrooms  And he obviously had to take a piss  Because he had his cock out already  But he was so drunk  He made a mistake  And he went into the woman's room  And he startled the lady  Who was sitting on the toilet  And she screamed 
[02:21:30]  This is for ladies  And the guy grabbed his cock  And said  So is this  The guy?  The guy?  The guy?  The guy?  Yeah  The guy?  There was a guy  I like the comfortable  Back and forth  Foot shifting  Back and forth  What the fuck am I?  Where am I from?  Back and forth  It is so awesome  To watch a giant  Uncomfortable man  The man that can crush your head  And he's so uncomfortable 
[02:22:00]  So speaking of Troy  All he likes to do  Is party and fuck  So let's welcome to the stage  Troy Kwan  Troy Kwan  He's got questions  There it is  He's got questions  Look out  Give it up for Club Soda Kenny  Oh yeah  There you go  Club Soda Kenny on Facebook  Everybody  So  I recently just got out  Of a long term relationship  And  You know  As you may know  It's not easy  Getting back  In the mix 
[02:22:30]  You know  Where you're  Getting back to dating  And  Going out with people  And  Really I've just  I've had enough  I'm done  I'm tired of spending money  That I don't have  On girls  On expensive dinners  And trying to impress  Broads  From here on out  It's strictly fat chicks  Dude  Big A got to the point  Faster than that  Do you know that  I'm not  Well if you want fat chicks  Troy  You'll have your pick  With our listeners  We don't want you either 
[02:23:00]  Oh Jimmy  You got face  Jimmy  And by the way  This is how pompous  I am  I thought she was saying  That to fucking  Handsome Troy Kwan  I really am delusional  You've been me  I apologize  Troy  We shouldn't interrupt  Go ahead man  Well let Role  Troy didn't really  Get to any jokes yet  Don't heckle  Let him get to it  Go ahead sweetie  Fat chicks are actually 
[02:23:30]  A lot of fun to fuck  You fold their belly fat  Like a quesadilla  And come inside  And like bad Mexican food  It's sure to make you sick  Afterward  That's funny  I like porkers  With short  Chubby arms  That have a problem  Wiping their ass  They look like a T-Rex  Trying to scratch its back  I like women 
[02:24:00]  That have a problem  Wiping their own ass  Because if a girl  Asks you to wipe her ass  That means you're fucking it  How can you boo that  It's a fucking  It's an invalid  Slash rape joke  How do you not like that  That's a hit  Fat chicks remind me  Of my youth  I was banging this slob 
[02:24:30]  From behind  And it reminded me  Of my uncle Frank  Tying his shoes  Who the hell is Frank  I love girls  That are so fat  When they're on top  Their ass gets caught  In the ceiling fan  Hey  Viva la fat chicks  Thank you  Oh yeah  Troy Kwan  Troy Kwan  Very nice job by Troy 
[02:25:00]  Good eye right  Yep  See it wasn't that bad  Yeah  Made it through  I like how all the  Comedians so far  Just have one theme  For the entire act  One guy did his dick  One guy his fat chick  You don't want to  Bust it up too much  Just one topic per set  That's the comedy rule of ones  And Ken  Ready to keep the show rolling  Of course  Yes  Great superhero sneakers  You fucking awful  Go ahead 
[02:25:30]  I said it  Was I going to say it again  I wanted to tell everybody  Last time I went to the doctor  I got a finger stuck  On my ass  Not because I needed it  Because of the  Ten dollar copay  I wanted my money's worth  And then one time  I went to a spa  To get a massage  And I asked for a male masseuse  Because I didn't want to feel  Like I was cheating  On my wife  And I ended up  Cheating on her anyway  By the way 
[02:26:00]  It's a masseur  Not a male masseuse  That tomato  Tomato  Tomato  Tomato  I'm fucking kidding  Alright  Let's welcome our next act  To the stage  He got a new tattoo  Put your hands together  For Danny  Yeah  Thanks Kenny  I got my credits 
[02:26:30]  I have a tattoo  It's nice  So  I was thinking  Why don't we call socks  Foot panties  I mean it just makes sense to me  You know  But uh  Preparing for this contest  Was really tough  Because I never had to write  Stand up before  So I really didn't know  Where to begin  And I just kind of thought  The most logical place  To start  When you're researching  Something like this  Is by watching some comedy  But uh  All that really did  Was make me jealous  Because the comics 
[02:27:00]  Were getting laughs  And all I really wanted to do  Was steal the jokes  Because they were funny  So I just compromised  And put on  Sir Carlos Mencia  I think stand up for me  Probably has to be  One of my all time  Biggest fears  And that's no joke  Probably  Like  Right next to  Waking up  Gay  And I'm not saying  That's a bad thing  Right Travis  But  I'm just saying  It would be a pretty  Shocking thing  To wake up  And all of a sudden 
[02:27:30]  You're gay  Like I would panic  I would panic  I wouldn't know  What to do  I mean capris  With sandals  Loafers  No socks  I mean foot panties  Sorry  But I'd really be  In absolute fear  What was that  It was a good callback  Now you've fucked me up  I don't know where I am  Oh don't be so fresh  But no really  It would be absolute fear  For me  I mean  The locker room  At the gym  Is a whole new  Experience now  Smells like balls 
[02:28:00]  In here  Mmm  I was afraid  That was gonna happen  So I was dating this girl  For about six months now  And it's pretty cool  It's pretty cool  Six months  It's a big deal  And it's cool  But it can get a little  Difficult sometimes  Because there's a kind of  An age difference involved  I'm 30 now  And she's only 20  So you know  Sometimes that age difference  Really affects the relationship  In some ways  We don't agree on  100% of the same things  One of which like food 
[02:28:30]  So you know  Dinner choices are limited  Sometimes it's like  A toss up between  Thai food and pizza  And so she'll be like  Wow what do you think  And I'm just like  Well we should probably fuck  A lot  A lot  Because we have  Different palettes  That's why  There's like three tags  On now  Can I just say one thing  Because these are good  Just one thing  Not enough setups  Sorry  Well you know 
[02:29:00]  You can't win  It's either the whole set  Is the same thing  Or you go  It's too much  But even Troy before  Could have just got to  The folding over your jizz  And the fat chick part  You're cutting into my time  Oh sorry  Oh Danny  I apologize  This is fucked up  You gotta like  This is my first time  On the stage  Give me a break  I was just trying  To be useful on this show  And I was taking away from you  And how many comics  Actually have to work  The crowd  Like they're being flanked  In a pincer maneuver  Yeah like  You're about to turn around  No no no  Like it's a flank steak  Or something  If I stop moving around 
[02:29:30]  It's over  You're like a shark  Anyway like I was saying  Right  Jesus  Writing for this thing  Was really hard  I actually  I like writing with a pen  Better than typing  Because I don't get  Those red lines of failure  All over the piece of paper  When I'm wrong  Sucks  See that's what happens  When you gotta flip your paper  To the other side of the notes  There's more joke there  You forget  So I'm watching this 
[02:30:00]  Hitler documentary  The other day  But I can't really enjoy  Yeah  Yeah  Woo  Hitler  Sorry  But I can't enjoy him  Like I used to  Because they always  Depict Hitler the same way  You know  Hitler doesn't change  He's always the same guy  He's screaming  He's sweating  He's angry  Kind of like Norton  Trying to use any product  Made by Apple  And I do throw it at a Jew  When I'm finished  But it really is the same 
[02:30:30]  All the time  And I'm the kind of guy  I'm fascinated by the side  Of the person  That you kind of  Don't expect to see  You know  Like I like to think about  Hitler stubbing his pinky toe  You know  Because it happens to everybody  It's just like  Oh  Fuck  Fuck  You know it's Hitler  Come on guys  That's funny right  Yeah alright  Whatever  But what about Hitler  With a public boner  Awkward  You know  Maybe he woke up gay  Who knows  What about Hitler's shave  He gets out the shower 
[02:31:00]  He fucks up his mustache  In the mirror  Maybe that's how  It ended up that way  In the first place  Fuck  Now it's uneven  Fuck  Now the other side's uneven  Fuck  I'll just go with it  Hey they can't all be singers  You already got one  That's all I got  You get a free mug  In Anthony's house  Good that's really cool  Keep talking  While I got a microphone  So 
[02:31:30]  I mean  Those Charmin bears  Really have an unhealthy  Relationship with the bathroom  Why is this family of bears  Always checking each other's  Assholes for dingleberries  And more importantly  How come no one's  Contacted social services  About this  It's only a matter of time  Before that father bear  Starts preying on other people  Hey little boy  Did you just go number two  Let me check your butthole  To see if it's clean  Let me see it  Let me see it  Is your butthole clean  You gotta check it Danny 
[02:32:00]  On the paper  Oh Uncle Bear  Oh Uncle Bear  You gotta give me some time  We're at 4.30 though  Oh shit  You're cutting into his time  My time is up  Oh yeah yeah yeah  Can I finish  Yes  Fuck it  Go ahead  So I wanna know  Why is it okay to follow people  On the internet now  People love having followers  Even companies market themselves  That way  To get new customers  Follow us on Facebook  Follow us on Twitter  My ex-girlfriend used to follow me 
[02:32:30]  On the internet  Before social media  But that was just called  Cyberstalking  And then before that  It was just called  Regular stalking  And that's not fun for anybody  Can you imagine that  Hi I follow you  In real life  They had Facebook back in 1995  I think that would be  Really strange  Because that's some  Pretty forward thinking  For the time  I mean they even got  The name right  Wow  When you bomb  On your clothes  That sucks  You know what 
[02:33:00]  Danny Ross  You slapped that guy's  Pan out of his hand  And that was pretty  Great earlier too  He did a good job  This is not an easy  Situation  Even  And double the time  Jesus  Yeah he did a good job  And uh  What's your name sir  Yeah Bobby Bacala  Bobby Bacala  Danny did good  Why am I talking like a girl  Danny did good  Hi Adam  Hi  That's all I wanted to know

[02:48:00]  And thus, thus, thus, thus, thus, thus, thus, dartling attacks happen in Oslo. 
[02:48:30]  It's just, just, seven hours, seven hours away from us, us, us, us, back home. 
[02:49:00]  That's just the beginning of the story, hold on.  The Killers, us, us, us, us, us, us, us, the Killers, us, us, us, the Killers, us, us, us. 
[02:49:30]  The Killers, us, we took, a bomb in a government building and went to a youth camp on an island and shot to death.  And shot to death dozens of people.  I actually feel they're luckier than we are right now. 
[02:50:00]  Stop stinking up the joint.  Oh.  What are you, one of the little rascals out there?  Stop stinking up the joint.  See?  I gotta.  Hey, woim.  Yeah.  Come on, I want to hear the story, guys.  Yeah, yeah.  What happened?  The man's.  Stockholm.  The man's. 
[02:50:30]  Us.  Us.  Us.  Oh.  The man's.  Us.  Faded.  Faded.  Faded.  Faded.  Why do you guys do this to people? 
[02:51:00]  I mean.  I know.  It's gorgeous.  That the staggering amount of murderers was necessary to stop liberal immigration and the threat of Islam. 
[02:51:30]  Yes.  Yes.  Big A.  Big A.  Thank you.  Very good.  Yeah.  But you can sit down.  That was Charlie.  Oh, yeah.  Thank you.  Big A, everyone.  Good job.  All the news you need to know.  That's right.  Two stories in a half hour.  Absolutely.  That was like the end of the King's speech.  I think it's time for more stand-up.  Where's our host?  Oh, yeah.  Club Soda Kenny.  There he is. 
[02:52:00]  Doing a heck of a job.  That's right.  In his wrinkle-free slacks.  Usually when he's in front of this many people, they have pitchforks and torches.  Or he's running around or something.  This is easy.  Does everybody know what rodeo sex is?  No.  It's when you're banging your girl from behind, and you start out really nice and slow, and 
[02:52:30]  then you grab her hair, and you pull her head back, and you whisper in her ear, your  sister was better with you.  And then you hang on and try to last for eight seconds.  Why would you say your sister is better with you?  Because I fucked it up.  I'm sure you have another one.  Yeah, come on.  One more.  It's all right.  It happens. 
[02:53:00]  Quick, before these lights start your hair on fire.  Your hair's so dry, it looks like it.  She'd be in a dry-up.  Does everybody know why the race car driver stopped and made ten pit stops?  Because he was asking for directions.  Shouldn't that have been the Polish race car driver?  Isn't that a Polish joke?  I tell it my way.  Which is, you made it a drama. 
[02:53:30]  All right.  But this next guy's going to be funnier than me.  So put your hands together.  For anybody.  Warm, warm, warm, welcome to Travis.  Travis!  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  Yes.  Thanks, Kevin.  Hi, guys.  Hi, Travis.  Hey, young Ed Powers.  I was saying hi to them, but...  I'm saying hi to you guys, Travis.  We're back here.  What?  Take the badge off.  It's unprofessional.  Sorry.  So I've lived in New York, New Jersey for most of my adult life, but I grew up in Florida, 
[02:54:00]  actually, for the first 12 years of my life, which I hated.  I hated the heat in Florida, even as a kid.  You normally don't notice that kind of stuff, but I just always hated it.  I couldn't wait to get out.  My brother and I, we would always run around naked in the backyard.  And we didn't have one of those gated backyards, either.  We would run around at the front.  Dude, I just imagined two little bearded kids that look like their faces hurt.  Yeah, just two little six-year-olds just running around, never got in trouble, no nothing. 
[02:54:30]  We did a lot of weird stuff.  Shut up, Bobo.  Exactly.  But we did a lot of weird stuff.  We did a lot of naked games for no reason, because we didn't live in a good neighborhood.  So we were really...  What does that have to do with the neighborhood?  Sounds like utopia to me.  We were really just friends with each other.  Why is every staff comedian, your stand-up starts with a long story about when you were young? 
[02:55:00]  Because I'm not a comedian.  Well, I guess that was fair enough.  Oh, good, Travis.  You remember all that big A material?  I wrote that.  That's where I excel.  Dude, you had me before.  So anyway, so we would do a lot of naked games.  It was fun.  We lived in Florida.  It was hot.  We had very active imaginations.  And we came up with this game called Undy Flip.  Yeah, Undy Flip!  See?  At least one person is as messed up as me and my brother. 
[02:55:30]  If you've never played it, you missed out on a great childhood experience.  What you do, you get completely naked, of course.  And you would leave your tighty-whities right around one ankle.  Demonstrate!  Just show it.  Not wearing any.  Post useless without pictures.  All right, so you get the tighty-whities on your foot.  Yeah, so you had tighty-whities on one foot, not both, because that would be silly. 
[02:56:00]  Okay.  Yeah.  And we had ceiling fans, and the ceiling fans wouldn't be on.  And the object of the game, for no reason, was to flip your undies onto the ceiling fan.  And my mother hated this game, because once you did get them on the ceiling fan, you had to get them off.  And the only way that we could get them off was to turn the ceiling fan on and just let them fly into the air.  And the ceiling fans were always very dusty, so we would end up having dusty underwear.  And that was the game.  There was no, you couldn't win, you couldn't lose, that was it. 
[02:56:30]  I remember I was over there one time, and it's...  I thought God was giving me a gift, because underpants fell down.  I thought, oh, these are nice.  Look at the little speckle of blood.  Oh, sorry, too early.  Go fuck yourselves.  Sorry, Travis, go ahead.  If you like that, you're going to love the next game we played.  So that was one bit? 
[02:57:00]  What's that?  Wait, so that was the first thing?  Yes, that was the first thing.  I like the way Travis addresses the heckle, though.  He fucking leans in.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Here comes the second thing, Craig.  What's your next thing that you're doing?  The next game we would play, this was completely naked,  because, you know, underwear's on the ceiling fan.  Is this all about games with your brother?  Yes, it is, Kurt.  Thank you for facing me and answering all my questions.  You're welcome.  Next game, it's also a flipping game. 
[02:57:30]  It's called Peenie Flip.  Act it out.  I can't act it out anymore.  It hurts now.  What we would do is we would be completely new.  This was another game you couldn't win, you couldn't lose.  You just had fun.  We would just get naked, and in a circular motion,  we'd just flip our penises around.  Just like that, just in a circular motion, no reason.  And that was my childhood.  Just two kids with their dicks out in the heat. 
[02:58:00]  Thank you.  You know what?  Cute stories.  I know I am not the only hard cock in this room.  No, you're not, Jim.  Good job, Travis.  You told some autobiographical stories.  I respect that.  Cute stories.  You thought those were cute?  They're adorable.  Thank you.  Yeah, undie flip and peenie flip.  I'll come over and, you know.  Well, I'm just going to tell you,  you probably shouldn't come over to the house anymore.  I love to play peenie flip.  It just sounds fun. 
[02:58:30]  Our next live event.  Flip your dick.  Somebody laughs.  Underwear on the fan.  There you go.  Travis.  He put the mic in the mic stand backwards.  Yeah.  He was a little nervous.  That's all right.  He did good.  His hand was shaking,  but I think Travis held it together, man.  Is everybody having a good time?  That's true.  How about a round of applause for our heroes,  Opie Anthony and Jim Norton.  Real heroic, what we're doing here. 
[02:59:00]  Making the world such a better place.  A lot of people.  And our friend Kurt.  Nice hand for Kurt Metzger.  Very funny stand-up comic.  Yeah, Kurt too.  And how about a hand for Club Soda Kenny's Iron.  Working well on those sleeves.  I've never seen such iron sleeves.  I can't have my sleeves wrinkled.  Sorry.  More staff confessionals, please.  Does everybody know why rednecks drive around 
[02:59:30]  in jacked-up four-wheel drive trucks?  Because fat girls can't jump that high.  And why do women wear makeup and perfume?  Because they're ugly and they stink.  Oh, I've heard that before, but it never gets old.  You know that?  Never gets old, no.  And now, ladies and gentlemen, 
[03:00:00]  the moment you've all been waiting for.  Kenny, can you tell one more joke?  What's that?  Can you tell one more?  Do you have one more?  I like your jokes.  Do a peony flip?  I like Kenny's jokes.  I do too.  You know what happens when I go one too many.  That is true.  Do the racist one.  Oh, he's not going to do any racist material.  Yes.  No, no, he can't do it.  He has to go and polish his sneakers.  Shiny shoe, motherfucker.  All right, guys, sir.  As I was saying, it's time for the star of this show. 
[03:00:30]  The man you've all come to see.  So put your hands together and give a warm welcome  to Eric Nagel, the sex bagel.  Ah, shit.  Ah, he's coming out to a little Paul Abdul.  There it is.  There it is.  He's hating this.  They're chanting his name.  He, rock, he, rock.  Wow.  Thank you. 
[03:01:00]  What's up, Hard Rock?  How are we doing today?  Before I start, if you could indulge me a little bit here.  And you know I like to indulge.  Can we just give it up for the troops?  Come on.  Give it up for the troops.  I don't really care about the troops,  but I wanted to get applause at least once while I'm up here.  That's a fucking good joke.  You went from Smith.  That's great.  As I said, my name's Eric. 
[03:01:30]  You may know me as E-Rock on the show.  Sex Bagel 2.  And I got the name E-Rock not necessarily because I rock.  It's because it's the only thing I don't eat.  Well, correction, can't digest.  Jesus, look at this audience.  Look at the size of this audience.  I feel like I'm back in a Weight Watchers meeting here.  Never at one.  That's like saying I was back on Jupiter. 
[03:02:00]  Well, yeah, I guess you're right.  I shouldn't be the one making fat jokes.  I mean, look at me.  A couple years in this show and I've gained a ton of weight.  What are you, Kathy?  I mean, look at me from...  Ack!  Ack, my swimsuit.  But, you know, being fat, it's taken its toll.  I mean, if I stand next to Roland, we look like the number 10, but he's the number one.  Get it? 
[03:02:30]  You look like a couple of zeros.  That joke was number two.  Well, it was because I was the fat zero.  I know, I'm teasing you.  You're not a fat zero.  You're a good boy.  I wouldn't...  What are you, his mother?  Yes.  You're not.  All right, you have four hours not to say anything.  Let me just do this.  Oh!  Fuck us here.  Fuck us running, as Anthony would say.  You're right.  We apologize.  I wouldn't say, like, I would stand next to Roland.  I mean, you can, if you're a fan of not having sound and light reach you. 
[03:03:00]  Oh, shit.  Oh, man.  Oh, sorry, Roland.  And what about Sam's riveting vasectomy story earlier?  Wasn't that fucking brilliant?  Sam vasectomy?  Let me ask you a question here.  Sam's a piece of shit, right?  I don't have a punchline.  I just wanted to see if we're all on the same page here.  Yeah. 
[03:03:30]  People on Broadway have no idea why they're going, yeah!  You learn.  You have a better haircut.  Speaking of his haircut, look at that fucking thing.  Looks like a Q-tip that was shoved up Roland's ass.  This is going well.  It is.  It is.  It is.  Staff stand-up.  You're probably wondering whose genius idea this was.  Well, it came from our own poster boy for the Make-A-Wish Foundation, Jim Norton, over there. 
[03:04:00]  Oh, that's nice.  And Anthony Cumia, you know, the Nazi.  And then Opie.  That's too easy.  Maybe the Nazi comment was a little harsh, you know.  I'm not saying that's racist, but Mel Gibson Twittered him and said, you might want to tone it down a little bit.  Hey, when Gibson Twitters you, dude.  Yeah, you got one down.  Well, we could go back to Opie, but, uh... 
[03:04:30]  It's easy to do it.  You're not taping this?  How are we going to go viral?  I mean, look at this.  This has legs.  Wow.  How much time do I have left here?  At the company, probably not much.  Sam's still a piece of shit, right? 
[03:05:00]  With the show nod.  Sam's still a piece of shit?  Just make sure we're all in agreement here.  You know, you learn a lot from doing a job.  Like this, working on the Opie and Anthony show.  This is the big leagues, top of the radio game, Sirius XM, 20 million subscribers, heard in two countries, online feed that doesn't work.  If working here has taught me one thing, it's that I could do better.  A lot better. 
[03:05:30]  Coincidentally, same thing my wife said to me during our wedding vows.  Oh, the poor dear.  Stand-up's difficult, you know.  You're doing good.  You know, I thought, you know, being a kid at a Norwegian labor camp was more difficult than this.  What?  What?  What?  Topical and brutal.  Very good.  Too soon?  What am I, too late?  Did I miss the boat on Norwegian shooting jokes? 
[03:06:00]  This fucking comedy's all about timing.  Well, I guess that about does it for me.  Look, I know a lot of you probably think I'm not funny.  A lot of you probably think I suck dicks.  But last time I checked, my name isn't Whitney Cummings.  Thank you very much.  Oh, damn.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Good job, E-Rock.  Going for the throat, E-Rock. 
[03:06:30]  Wow.  Good job, E-Rock.  Good job.  Good job.  Very good job.  That was really good.  That was the big surprise of the day for me.  I didn't think he would do that good.  He did very well.  It was all that bile coming out.  Sam, are you offended at what he said about you?  I didn't care for that stuff.  The piece of shit stuff?  Yeah.  It was accurate.  Were you a garbage and you looked like you were shoved up Roland's asshole?  That type of stuff.  That's a great line.  Eric didn't say garbage.  Why would your mic work? 
[03:07:00]  Where's Roland?  Were you all right with E-Rock's material?  I can understand.  I don't speak well.  What?  You know what he said?  He goes, I didn't understand it.  I don't speak well.  But he said well.  I don't speak well.  But he said well instead of well.  I think you said well.  Either way, we're going.  Yeah.  All right.  Fine.  Miss, that's a very...  Not to go into the audience, but I like your hat.  That's cute.  That doesn't stand out in Manhattan.  Yeah, that is...  No, it does. 
[03:07:30]  Oh, literal Jim.  Yeah.  What?  I said at least I'm not getting abused for it.  I'm the only girl in here with a hat on like this.  Jesus.  It's Chipette.  Yeah.  I think you're beautiful.  I like your cowboy hat.  We should go out on a date or something.  I'll take that hat off.  Fuck you.  Oh, shit.  I guess that's where Iraq went to go put his saddle on. 
[03:08:00]  Oh, there's no need to be mean.  I know.  He did great, though.  He did.  He's going to pay for that, but he did.  I think Bobo wants to do three minutes.  Oh, wow.  I forgot about Bobo.  Holy shit.  What a treat this is.  All right, cool.  I did not think you were top Iraq just now.  Damn.  Oh, he can.  That's it.  Eager to get to the stage.  Bobo.  Hello, Daniel.  Hey, good evening, Aardvark. 
[03:08:30]  Good evening.  Just say hi to an Aardvark.  We're here at the Aardvark Cafe.  The Aardvark Cafe.  What are you doing, Aardvark?  Bobo, slow down.  Wait, wait.  The intro, Bobo.  We need an intro.  Bobo, wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Jesus Christ.  You're panicking.  Look at him.  He's freaking out.  You're panicking.  He's pulling up his pants.  Exactly.  Put some socks on.  I'm fine with you.  Look at him freaking out like he's not going to fly Qantas.  Believe it or not, but believe it, we got an extra. 
[03:09:00]  What happened?  We hear the mic.  Believe it or not, but believe it, we got an extra special guest.  Who is it?  Who is this mystery guest?  And what I mean by special, here's Bobo.  Bobo.  Bobo.  Good day, Aardvark.  Aardvark.  Aardvark.  I had this crazy encounter at the supermarket recently. 
[03:09:30]  I don't know.  I saw these two people that were mentally impaired.  Mostly all they do is just pack the bags.  They just load the bags.  But these people were speaking in some, I don't know, some noise or something.  And I know these guys weren't deaf.  All right?  They could hear perfectly because I freaking tell them to pack my bags.  And they do that.  But I've always noticed these making some noise.  I don't know what they were doing.  But they clearly freaking understand what they were saying.  They were going. 
[03:10:00]  And then the other one was going.  And I said, what the fuck are you saying?  And these people freaking understand what they're saying.  Bobo, they're still your parents, dude.  Come on.  Put me some new language.  I should just start speaking to everybody like that.  These guys in the supermarket are going, what the fuck, you guys?  All right?  I don't go to your job.  I don't go to every one of your jobs and heckle you. 
[03:10:30]  Bobo, you're doing awesome, dude.  All right?  Work through it.  Work through it, Bobo.  Bobo, you got to connect with the audience, Bobo.  Go ahead, you talk while when I talk.  And you freaking people from Philly.  Philly suck.  You guys from Philly, you're going to collapse.  And we're going to make the playoffs.  It's going to be a reverse of 07-08.  You guys.  And all your freaking teams in your city are going to suck this year. 
[03:11:00]  They suck.  They suck.  Your Eagles suck.  Your Flyers suck.  And the 76ers suck.  He's doing great.  Yeah, he sure is.  Go.  God.  Get back to your material, Bobo.  Let's go.  Come on, Bobo.  Get to the material.  Back to the material.  Do another bit.  Another joke.  Not being professional.  Or do some crowd work.  Something.  Another joke.  I'll tell you a little bit about this time.  I almost got my dick sucked at a bar.  There you go. 
[03:11:30]  There you go.  Now you're talking.  Now you're talking.  I'll tell you about it, right?  Yeah, at a bar.  At a bar I go to, right?  This woman offered New Year's party.  All of a sudden she freaking comes out of the bathroom freaking laughing saying, it's  a tiny dick at all.  It's a tiny dick, all right?  It's a tiny dick, all right?  It's a small, small dick.  Oh, God.  We go to that laughing, the whole bar, the whole bar. 
[03:12:00]  I get freaking people laughing.  And I all of a sudden see freaking people with the slide whistles all of a sudden.  Doing what Ant does.  Freaking whole bar freaking ruined New Year's.  What, preparing to shoot you in the back of the head?  You're not, Bobo, you're not, Bobo, Bobo, you're not connecting.  What you got to do to connect with the audience is you're just coming out and you're yelling  words eagerly.  You have to connect a little bit.  You can't be so wrapped up in your head that you're just not, you're not interacting.  You slow down, relax, talk in a normal voice.  You just ran out. 
[03:12:30]  Words, words, words, words, words, words, words, words.  You have to pause a little bit, brother.  Yeah, take your time.  You come out and say hello to the audience.  You know, you're walking in front of a room full of people.  Say hi, how are you?  Yes, how are you guys?  We're going to make the long trip.  If I saw the whole line, this is more of people than there was a few years ago, this  place looked like it was so empty than a day when the Mets weren't winning. 
[03:13:00]  That's what this place looked like in 08.  Halloween 08.  It was so empty.  I thought, was I here or was I at City Field in September?  Holy shit.  I said City Field in September.  This is brutal.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  How was the Mets game?  Oh, the hot chick wants to ask a question.  What did she say?  No, I annoyed my whole sister the whole game.  I freaking called her Obie because Obie was supposed to be at that game. 
[03:13:30]  Oh, that's right.  I had the ticket.  I was so bummed.  I was so bummed out about it.  I called Shannon Obie the whole game.  She freaking got annoyed the whole time when she arrived at the game.  I made her even say to me, how are you doing there, brother man, brother man?  What?  I'm not ready for a ticket.  What?  Yeah, you ripped the ticket.  That's why I couldn't go, Bobo.  You did.  Remember, you ripped the ticket.  That ticket worked.  I gave my sister.  Holy shit.  Listen, it's not a good delivery.  I invited you, Anthony.  Didn't you see the invite on Twitter? 
[03:14:00]  Yeah, where was I going to go?  I invited you, Ant.  I'd have gone with your sister.  Yeah.  These stories are fascinating.  I invited you to the game.  Tards are easy to fuck.  And two more years, Ant.  Two more years.  And then she's too old for me.  What do you mean, and then she's been too old for you for eight years?  Well, Jimmy was also invited.  Bobo, you're done.  Yeah, Bobo.  Thank you.  Nice hand for Bobo.  Bobo, you're done.  Oh, my God. 
[03:14:30]  What a great job, Bobo.  It's just noise.  Holy shit.  It's just fucking noise.  Wow.  Seems like...  All right.  What are you doing up there, Sam?  Look like your hair's got blown out or something by wind.  I think we got one more special guest, right?  Wow.  Yeah.  Dice, yeah.  Dice.  You got it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Dice, yeah.  All right.  Oh, oh, oh.  Well, the laughs are just going to keep on coming, folks. 
[03:15:00]  It's unbelievable that he agreed to make an appearance.  But here he is, the virus, ladies and gentlemen.  Oh, shit, the virus.  Come on, the virus.  The virus.  Oh, yeah.  We got his music playing?  All right.  Good, good.  Wow.  Hi, guys.  Hi, virus.  Virus.  Oh, a catchphrase.  I love catchphrases.  What's up, hard rock?  It's hard part. 
[03:15:30]  It's the hard part.  It's hard part.  According to Bobo.  We got to give him a topic, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Way to end it on a low light here.  A low light?  Whatever you call it.  Yeah.  Just call it dusk.  A topic for the virus.  Wow.  Anyone have a topic out there?  How about the chick in the cowboy hat?  Madam in the cowboy hat, what's the topic for the virus?  Yeah, any topic.  Norway. 
[03:16:00]  Norway.  Norway.  She said Norway.  That was a big comedy.  Oh, boy.  Cornucopia.  Can you go with Norway?  Oh, is that the story A reported on earlier?  That was the first I'd heard that.  Yeah, yeah.  Wait, she's got another topic.  Oh, okay.  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Meet me, Anthony.  How about Amy Winehouse?  Amy Winehouse.  Yeah, there you go.  All right.  Looking for one punchline for the virus.  Yes.  About Amy Winehouse.  Winehouse.  Who's that guy?  Probably getting fired.  Looks like the vulture from the Spider-Man cartoon. 
[03:16:30]  All right.  Here's the virus with one punchline about Amy Winehouse.  And go.  Go.  Bye, guys.  Don't yell at him.  You're going to make him nervous.  At least do the setup.  Yeah, if you heard.  You like when he does the setup.  Hey, guys.  Did you hear about Amy Winehouse?  Yeah.  Of course, what happened to her virus?  Here comes the punchline. 
[03:17:00]  Three, two.  They're all watching and waiting.  Go.  And go.  Now.  What about her?  Do the bit.  Do the bit.  You want to do the setup again, maybe?  You're not doing very good improv.  You just got to kind of go with it, you know?  Hit ball.  Do the setup again.  Hey, guys.  Did you hear about Amy Winehouse? 
[03:17:30]  Yeah.  Dead.  No.  What about her?  What happened?  What happened?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Okay.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  We might have one.  We might have a punchline.  Hey, guys.  Did you hear about Amy Winehouse?  Yeah.  Dead.  Stupid whore.  They haven't really figured out how she died.  A friend of mine said, do you think she overdosed?  And I said, well, it sure wasn't a fucking bear attack. 
[03:18:00]  Oh, wow.  That's a punchline.  I think the virus came out with something, but let's keep the bit on it.  Thank you.  Boom.  Yeah.  That's not a very good one, but it works.  The virus, everyone.  I thought it was going to go with congrats on one week sober.  That's fucking hilarious.  Is that yours or is that a joke joke?  I read it.  That's good.  I've got to be honest.  I should have said that.  That is a good one, though.  I'm going to say that in three weeks. 
[03:18:30]  I'll say a month.  Who's the girl right up front, if you don't mind me asking?  You're very lovely.  I'm not trying to hit on you.  That's your type, Jimmy.  Yes, she is my type.  She's alone.  The one over there is Jimmy's type.  Are you alone?  No.  Who are you with?  Uh-oh.  Oh, your boyfriend?  Is that your boyfriend?  That scared me, though.  She was pointing in one direction.  I was going, oh, shit. 
[03:19:00]  Black guys.  Wow.  How long are you with this gentleman?  Two years.  All right.  That's a real, real.  Two years, man.  Fuck.  How old are you?  I'm 17.  Oh, my God.  I'm glad I didn't ask that follow-up anal question I had.  Have you been with him for two years?  Wow.  And I actually regret not asking it.  Wait.  How old is the guy?  He looks a little old.  How old is the guy?  How old are you?  How old are you, sir?  I'm 19.  All right.  So you really just got in there under the wire. 
[03:19:30]  That's good.  Anthony, you're my inspiration.  Ah, that's good.  Well, you've got to aim a little lower.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's pretty good.  Yeah.  When you say how old, you want her to go and hold one hand up.  Welcome, Paul.  This is a fun event.  Now, the girl up front in the white there, what's your name?  Lauren.  Hi, Lauren.  Where do you live?  Staten Island. 
[03:20:00]  Oh, Staten Island?  All right, cool.  Well, I'm from Brooklyn.  I'm from Flatbush.  All right, more information.  Where were you conceived?  What?  What scene from Goodfellas was playing?  Why are you pointing at the girl on the cowboy hat?  Someone's pointing at her.  Where's she from?  I think you're hot.  Where are you from?  Brooklyn.  Brooklyn girls.  What's with the...  We grew up together.  Oh, you're friends.  We grew up together.  All right.  Did you play on the Verrazano? 
[03:20:30]  A little local humor for you.  Bridge joke.  It's great.  Did they ever make out?  You guys ever make out growing up?  No.  Why not?  No.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No.  No?  All right.  All right.  Well, the cowboy hat, would you like...  I'll only make out with Chip.  Yeah, well...  Whoa.  I'd kiss you so good.  I'll fuck you right now.  Chip gets so inappropriate when he gets a little nervous. 
[03:21:00]  So what?  Especially around girls.  I'll put it in right where the shit comes out.  I love the mystique and mystery Chip keeps in a relationship.  It's a romantic.  It's a romance, yeah.  It's a romantic.  So where'd you grow up?  Staten Island.  Staten Island?  I did not grow up in Staten Island.  I grew up...  You make a big point of saying that, too.  I don't like being associated with Staten Island.  Sorry if I offend anybody.  What's wrong with Staten Island?  I'm from Jersey.  You think you're better than me?  I'm from New Jersey.  Fuck you, Jim Staten Island. 
[03:21:30]  You grew up on Jersey's garbage.  How dare you?  Your home was built on a condom I used in 1997.  Oh, the last one you used?  Yeah, I'll kiss you later, though.  Oh, wow.  Where are you going to kiss her?  On a pussy?  I'm going to kiss you where it smells like Staten Island. 
[03:22:00]  I was going to say that.  Fucking asshole.  That's the place.  We do have a nice turnout of women, I think, right, Hope?  Yeah, we did all right with women for us.  We talked to them all.  What are we doing different that we got women coming to these things?  Who's the one standing up over there?  We got a redhead.  We have a brunette standing up there.  Hi, madam.  What's your name?  I'm Amanda.  Amanda, are you a New Yorker? 
[03:22:30]  Yes, I am.  What part of the...  I'm from Long Island.  Oh.  There you go.  Home of Anthony Cumia.  That's true.  Strong Island in his house.  Shut up.  What part, though?  That's important.  Yes.  I live in Long Beach.  Oh, okay.  Long Beach is all right.  Down there.  That's nice.  What part of Long Island did you lose your virginity in?  Massapequa.  All right, speak to her as she knows.  Massapequa.  Another wine dance.  Was it a Baldwin brother?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:23:00]  Was it Alec Baldwin?  Jesus.  Fucking shit.  Fucking shit.  It was a disaster.  Who's your boyfriend?  I am here by myself.  Oh.  Hey, you need a ride to Staten Island?  She'll take you.  How much do you weigh?  Oh, so that's the wrong question.  How old are you?  I'm 27.  That's perfect.  Got a daughter? 
[03:23:30]  Why?  It's time.  I just keep fucking putting that on my head.  Are you single?  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, that means...  What do you think?  Today.  That means today she's single.  So you got somebody...  I don't have a boyfriend.  What's the darkest dick that's ever been in you?  Yes.  It's not very dark, Anthony.  Not dark.  You are.  I think she's lying.  I like white boys.  Ah, there you go. 
[03:24:00]  Oh, yes.  I'm white.  I like twinks like Sam, too.  Oh!  Oh, Sam.  Where's Sam?  Right here?  Oh, I can't see that one.  What do you think of that, Sam?  It's very flattering.  Thank you so much.  Sam's going to be a married man soon.  Yeah.  Buddy's single now.  Yes.  Yeah.  So, Amanda, what kind of work do you do?  I'm an auditor.  Oh, you work for the IRS or no?  No.  An accounting firm.  Oh, an accounting firm.  Oh, my God.  Okay. 
[03:24:30]  I'm probably going to have a lot of conversation.  Very boring, definitely.  Yes.  So if four goes into you once...  Get it?  Can I have a small penis?  Well, what kind of date do you think we would have together?  I don't even know if I could go on a date with you.  I'd be, like, freaking out.  Are you kidding?  Me, too.  I'm in love with you, Jimmy.  Come on.  I would handle that well.  But what about you?  I'm fucking here.  We would have a great date together.  Wait, she's here because of you.  Oh, she's here for the whole show, I'm sure. 
[03:25:00]  Oh, she's here for you.  Jimmy Norton.  She's pretty clear.  But, yeah, you guys are all right.  Jimmy's an endearing little sweetie.  She's here for you, Jimmy.  I need a girl who's like, oh, my God, I love this.  Ask her out.  Ask her out.  I can do that.  Can you do that really good?  Huh?  I would never let you.  I'm on my, you know.  Have you period?  What's your problem?  I don't know.  I'm talking in gym voice as Chip.  What the fuck's wrong with me?  You just lost it.  So would you like to go out to dinner? 
[03:25:30]  I would love that.  Oh, that was quick.  Wow.  And me.  This is like a...  Why did you even bother with dinner?  Dude, that's my question.  Breakfast.  Breakfast?  Like now.  I have to shit, though.  I got to go home and shit.  Excuse me.  That's really good.  I always have to...  No, no, I'm not trying to be gross, but I always have to drop a big deuce after work.  So I want to shit and clean out the asshole.  Because we got two minutes.  All right, we'll talk...  I've never heard you say anything gross like that before.  Oh, I like that.  She knows.  I can handle shit. 
[03:26:00]  Oh, you like to dirty shit.  Oh, good.  Hey, would you drop a log on his chest?  Fair question.  Let's cut to the chase.  There's a first for everything.  Yeah.  There's rumors that Jimmy might be into that.  We're not sure.  And we want a log, by the way, not a nervous, soupy one, because that would just be embarrassing.  I'm sorry.  We're ending the show on shit.  I'm probably...  This is terrible of us.  All right.  The whole show is shit.  I think we were the opening act for this thing, the fantasy sports.  The fantasy sports, if anybody...  Are people allowed to stay for that?  Yeah, they are. 
[03:26:30]  Okay.  All right.  I don't know what it's about.  I don't know much about...  We're going to wrap up the radio show, but we're going to hang, take some pictures and shit, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, let's hear it.  Seriously, let's hear it for the staff.  The staff.  They really didn't want to do that, and I think they did a great job today.  All of them.  Roland and Troy and Danny and Travis and E-Rock and who am I forgetting and Sam.  And Club Soda Kenny.  Of course, Club Soda Kenny.  Let's hear it for Kurt Metzger.  Kurt Metzger.  Kurt.  Yes.  Stalker Patty, Big A, Papramunaki. 
[03:27:00]  Bobo.  Fucking Bobo.  Ugh.  Yuck.  Look at him.  He's taking bows out there.  And Amanda for not minding herpes.  All right.  We'll see you guys on the radio tomorrow.  We're hanging here for a little while.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Live from the Hot Rock Cafe.  Thank you, guys.  This has been the OBNN3 Show.  Live from the Hard Rock Cafe in Times Square, New York.  Stay tuned for Jim Norton and Sam Roberts' Comic-Con Adventure.  Next on The Virus. 
[03:27:30]  Epic interviews.  Awkward encounters.  And the quest for sweet celebrity photos.  This is Jim Norton and Sam Roberts' Comic-Con Adventure 2011.  Oh, yes.  You betcha.  It's me, Sam Roberts, here.  And this is the, what is it called?  Jim Norton and Sam Roberts' Comic-Con Adventure.  I guess everybody needs a catchy title or whatever that is.  It's the Comic-Con show.  The show that chronicles the time that Jim Norton and I had at the San Diego Comic-Con just last weekend. 
[03:28:00]  Comic-Con is just a wonderful place to be.  Jim and I were there last year.  And even though, if you don't remember, look it up on YouTube or something.  But if you do, it was a disaster in terms of getting interviews and finding out where to be and everything.  It was a disastrous trip.  But being at Comic-Con itself was a magical experience.  So magical that we insisted, Jim and I, on going back for another year. 
[03:28:30]  And that's what we did.  We were there live in person for the 2011 San Diego International Comic Convention.  A lot of people from Sirius were there this year.  But guess what?  It was just Jim and me from the virus.  So that's what you're stuck with on the Jim Norton and Sam Roberts Comic-Con Adventure.  It's not just comic books anymore, folks.  You probably already know this.  But it's everything pop culture.  They have movies and TV and video games and toys and a few comic books. 
[03:29:00]  Everything your little heart would ever desire in the pop culture world.  And now big celebrities come to these things and do panels and talk to the press.  I mean, it's almost become a giant press junket more than, you know, a comic book convention.  But it's everything all rolled into one.  It's a huge event.  And Jim and I got to speak to many of those big stars and many of those fans.  You'll hear all that on this Comic-Con Adventure show, whatever it's called. 
[03:29:30]  We'll start with an interview that Jim got to do.  As I said, people come from miles around to promote their movies and their television shows.  Community is one of the hottest shows on NBC right now.  Joel McHale is the star.  He's been on the show before.  I'd like to say he's a friend of the show.  In his heart, I know he's a friend of the show.  But it's been a long time since any of us heard from Joel McHale.  We got to catch up with him at Comic-Con this year. 
[03:30:00]  And Jim Norton sat down.  Ken Jeong happened to be in the room doing an interview with somebody else while Norton was interviewing Joel.  So keep your little ears open for that.  This is our Comic-Con show.  Jim Norton and Sam Roberts' Comic-Con Adventure 2011.  Well, we're sitting here with Joel McHale from Community.  Congratulations, man, on how huge the show is.  Thank you, Jim.  And thank you for coming all this way.  And I'm so glad this is my... 
[03:30:30]  I go on O.P. Anthony like every other month now.  Sorry, guys.  I'm sorry.  No, no, it's fine, dude.  I have a question about the way they shoot Community.  Because a lot of times I'm in the gym and I'll see...  Is it shot differently than most shows?  Because the quality of the video looks really...  Like, it's really different than anything else.  Or am I just, for some reason, seeing that differently?  You're actually...  You're absolutely right.  There was a conscious decision when the series first started to not look like a lot of the  comedies on TV, which a lot of comedies now are shot documentary style, handheld, real 
[03:31:00]  light, and they use a lot of confessionals.  And it's that mockumentary thing.  And we did not want to do that and to make ourselves look separate from those.  And they wanted to be cinematic.  So, yeah, you're right.  They want it to look more like a movie than a documentary.  Do you do stand-up as well?  I do.  Yes, yes.  Did you start as a stand-up or did you start doing stand-up once you began to do well?  I started stand-up after The Soup started. 
[03:31:30]  I started about three years ago.  And because my agent said you can make a lot of money.  And I was like, really?  Let's go do that.  Yeah, so it has been a trial by fire.  And I think, I don't know, you know, you have to go up a thousand times before, you  know, before jokes start working.  But you're used to it, though, because from doing The Soup, you're talking about things  that are going on.  It's all topical stuff.  So you're probably pretty good at writing topical material. 
[03:32:00]  Yes.  There was a lot of wiener jokes a month ago.  But, yeah, The Soup was a strange, not exact perfect training ground for stand-up.  But, yeah, I mean, it's just me telling jokes for, you know, 22 minutes every week.  So, yeah, it really, really helped.  Do you go up a lot?  I mean, do you try to go up a few times a week and do the stand-up?  I try to go up.  But with, like, now the community is shooting again.  We have really long hours.  And I got two kids.  And I do write jokes, but I, and so if I know I'm going to be telling some new jokes, 
[03:32:30]  I'll try to go up and tell them.  I'll see how badly they bomb.  But I was in a weird situation because people were already watching The Soup, and that's  when I kind of started.  So I didn't have to do what, I didn't have to, you know, prove myself the way that real  comics have had to.  I used to have to be funny, though.  I mean, they'll give you the first five minutes, but anything after that, they're not going  to give you.  Yeah, I think Charlie Sheen's show demonstrated that in Detroit.  So, but yeah, no, it was, yeah, now, I mean, now I'm much more comfortable doing it. 
[03:33:00]  But as you know, it's, there's no safety net out there.  No, and I kind of, I think that's what I like about it.  And as opposed to acting, and to me, acting is harder because I can't acknowledge when  something is going wrong when I'm acting.  When I'm doing stand-up, I can really just blow it up if I'm bombing.  But when you're acting and you're bombing, it's horrendous.  Yes.  Thank God for editing.  And yeah, I mean, you've seen Chevy, no, I'm just kidding.  No, yeah, you're right.  I mean, I, I, I, it's funny because I love the acting so much and it's what I very, well, 
[03:33:30]  as sometimes not good, I mean, I'm comfortable doing it.  I love doing it.  So, yeah, it's, it's one of those things where, you know, thank God community is coming  back for a third season.  And, um.  Were you a trained actor before you did The Soup?  Was that, did you come up acting or did you start, again, start acting after?  I came up acting.  Um, I went to graduate school for it.  And when you have a degree, that means you're really good.  Uh, no, uh, yeah, that was what I really pursued.  And when I came here, that's what I came to do. 
[03:34:00]  But I did, I chose, I, I took The Soup because, um, because of Greg Kinnear, the pedigree of that.  And, um, the people that had done that and then gone on to do acting, that's why I did  it.  Uh, because I could not get into those audition rooms to get, you know, for parts that I wanted  or for like, um, you know, being like a series regular, you, I couldn't even get into those  rooms.  So I figured The Soup was, you know, The Soup became like a half an hour audition tape in  a weird way.  And, and obviously, I mean, I love doing the show, but, uh, but people began to go like, 
[03:34:30]  oh yeah, bring that guy in for that thing.  So it really worked out.  Well, Kinnear's a great actor.  I mean, uh, what did he do with Cuba Gooding and, uh, Jack Nicholson as good as it gets,  I think.  And what else, what else has he done?  Like, what was his first breakthrough role?  People like, wow, this guy can really act.  Uh, Sabrina with, um, Harrison Ford and, uh, what's her name?  Julie, uh, she's, I'm, I would kill me if I didn't, but that was the first, he got that  big role in that.  And then, um, uh, he was, did you see, um, it was the one with Mark Wahlberg about the Philadelphia 
[03:35:00]  Eagles.  He played, uh, Dick Vermeule.  No, my friend Dove is in that and I'm so passive aggressive.  I won't watch a guy on my level who does a movie, so I didn't watch.  Oh, I, I understand that.  It's really good.  But his, like, even his Dick Vermeule was incredible.  Like, I'm like, oh my gosh, he's doing a Dick Vermeule.  It wasn't an impression.  We're like, he can even do that.  Uh, but he's worked like consistently enough for like 20 years in the movies.  So.  Do you like being a, I mean, I guess you enjoy it because it's good you do the panel and stuff  like that.  But, uh, is this a culture that you're comfortable with the way people are here or did you have 
[03:35:30]  to kind of get used to it?  No, I mean, it's, it's a weird thing to go somewhere and have people tell you all day  long that you're great.  Um, it's.  I said right, but this is what a phony.  I said right like I experienced that.  I imagine that would be irritating.  You're great.  This is why I'm here to tell you.  No, but it is this thing where you, uh, I, it's weird.  Um, but people talk about, Oh, I gotta go to Comic-Con.  I'm like, you have to go be adored.  And, uh, okay, good.  I'm sorry that you have to go through that.  Um, but, uh, you know, it's one of those things.  Like the last year was, uh, really surprising that really, cause they were like, we walked 
[03:36:00]  in, they're like, okay, there's 2000 people out there.  We're like, Oh, geez.  Okay.  Uh, but their response was, and there was, it raised this huge ego stroke.  So, but, uh, yeah, I really, I think the, uh, with all the people in the costumes,  it's really fun atmosphere and, um, I, yeah, it's great.  I know that people have been like, it's just turned into a huge Hollywood junket, which  it kind of, I guess, has, but, uh, with that.  Where else can you see the cast of a show or a film and get to talk to them? 
[03:36:30]  I mean, there's nowhere else you can do that.  No.  I mean, Spielberg was here yesterday and, um, he was a tough one to get.  Did you get, how was his interview?  I wouldn't know.  We didn't get one.  I'm sorry.  But Peter Jackson, he, did you?  We, we turned him down.  Yeah.  I, I wouldn't have done that, but he seems great.  Uh, but yeah, it's a, I, I don't, have you been here before?  Yeah.  I was here last year with Sirius, um, and we came back this year.  It was, I, I had a lot of fun.  Nice.  All over the place.  Um, a little bit, uh, but you know, an average amount, the same as New York. 
[03:37:00]  Nothing spectacular.  All right.  As much as I'd like.  Yeah.  It, um, it's a great place for, I mean, you, everything, I mean, it, it, it's just a great,  I mean, you said like you can see the casts of everything and you see all these, all the,  like I can't, I want to see Cowboys, Cowboys and Aliens, so, uh, I hope I can sneak in.  Daniel Craig was at Anthony's house.  Uh, yeah, yeah, he hung out with Anthony, went to a gun range, he was over Anthony's  house, and we want to go to the premiere tonight just to establish the fact that he does not  remember Anthony.  We're hoping that he just is like, who?  Good idea. 
[03:37:30]  And he has the eyes of a wolf, if you look at his eyes.  I don't, I'm, I always.  Interacted by them all the time.  Really?  Anthony said he's a beautiful guy, like he's a really handsome dude.  Yeah, and I, I'm happy to admit that, I'm, I'm, yeah, he's gorgeous.  As you stand up, do you think helped with panel because you're in front of 3,000 people?  Are you kind of like the go-to guy?  I mean, Chevy's obviously very experienced with stuff like that, but, uh, are the other  cast members as comfortable?  Oh, you'll see if you're there, uh, the, uh, oh yeah, I mean, Ken Jeong.  If you turn a light on Ken Jeong, and of course, Donald and Danny, I mean, Donald's, his 
[03:38:00]  hip-hop career is exploding, so he's been in front of, uh, um, thousands and thousands  of people, but when, you get Danny and Donald going, and it's terrific, and now we have  Jim Rash, the, who plays the dean, and he's, he's also the bald guy, he's amazing, I'm just  so, was he a stand-up?  I think he was a stand-up, right?  He used to do a really weird character?  Yeah, he was a stand-up, and that's when he was a doctor at Kaiser Permanente, and he  was miserable doing his day job of being a doctor, and he, you know, I, uh, then he was 
[03:38:30]  doing stand-up at night, and then he finally, he got knocked up, and he finally, uh,  knocked up the, uh, movie, and then he finally was able to kind of say goodbye to being a  doctor, and, and he, he'll tell you how much of a, how much happier he, he was pretty miserable  being a doctor.  You know, it's funny, I thought he used to do a character named Dr. Ken or something,  someone said he would kill, because a, a lot of comics have trouble in black rooms, they're  tough audiences sometimes, but they said he would go into this Dr. Ken character and  destroy the room, I guess that was him.  Yeah, I mean, he's, he is like, um, Rumpelstiltskin, in that he can spin, he sees the 
[03:39:00]  room, he'll, like, adapt to the situation, and he can just invent comedy out of nothing.  What kind of, uh, doctor was he?  He was a, I think he was a general practitioner, uh, I mean, he was just a, uh, yeah, he was  like a family doctor, I believe, I think.  Amazing what people walk away from to do entertainment.  Yeah.  People are like, oh, you were helping people become healthy, and, and now you're just a  silly person, uh, with your penis out, and he's like, yes, but he's helping people,  but, no, uh, he, um, diagnoses people on set. 
[03:39:30]  Joe Russo, our, one of our executive producers, um, he, Joe was having leg pain, and the, uh,  the studio nurse showed up, and basically was like, uh, this is clearly a circulation problem,  uh, you, she called it some horrible disorder, and she's like, you should go to the, you should  go to the emergency room right now.  And, uh, and Joe started getting freaked out, and Ken, I was like, uh, Ken went and examined  his legs, and he's like, Ken started asking me all these questions, and he's like, yeah, 
[03:40:00]  you have sore muscles.  You have, uh, you, you overexerted yourself, clearly.  He went, he, like, he found out what, he was like, oh, you did, you did, you did, like,  strenuous, like, work on the house two days ago?  Yeah, you, you, uh, you, your legs are really sore, maybe a pulled muscle, but.  It's ballsy, though, because if he's wrong, and if he really did need to go to the hospital,  there's a certain amount of balls to a doctor, like, a courage, that, uh, to tell people,  like, nah, you don't need to go to the hospital, because there is a risk they could drop dead.  Yeah, I can't, I guess you could sue him, but not for malpractice, it was just like, 
[03:40:30]  a guy told you one thing, and you took his advice.  Is he still allowed to practice medicine, or does that, like, run out?  No, you have to keep that up, and I don't think he has, but.  He probably could if he wanted to.  He could, oh, definitely, and he has that thing where you can see him switch and become a doctor,  like, if someone gets hurt, he, you can see him immediately, he's, he's like a superhero changing,  and he, uh, will be like, oh, you can see he immediately is, you know,  asked doing all the things that is, it's kind of awesome to see.  I think right there.  I'm looking at him, and he, from the side, he kind of has hair like Alan Alda and MASH. 
[03:41:00]  Yes, he does have Alan Alda hair.  What's up, Ken?  We're just talking about you, Ken.  I'm always amazed by what people will give up to, to, to come here and do this.  It's something he always wanted to do, and, um, he, like, getting his, doing his residency  at UCLA and stuff was not, you know, it wasn't a coincidence, I think, because he knew in  the back of his mind he was going to try to be an actor, and, Ken, I just want to show  you.  We were just gushing about you. 
[03:41:30]  We're just talking about something really crazy.  I know, I know.  Look at the hands.  Oh, you got it?  Look how small the hands are.  Wow, you do have small hands.  I have very small hands.  I didn't know you were a doctor.  Joel just told me you were a doctor at one point.  Used to, you, yeah, I was a practicing physician.  Remember he had sore legs, and Joe Russo had sore legs, and he was convinced that he had,  like, a, a blood clot, like, deep in his legs.  It was a pulled hammy.  That's what I love about Joe Russo.  He's, like, the nurse was like, it might be a clot.  You should go to the nurse. 
[03:42:00]  Joe, you're right.  It was, it wasn't, it was a nurse.  Freaked him out.  And I don't want to freak me out, too, and then, and I actually examined him in my trailer.  Just me and Joe Russo in my trailer, palpating his, palpating his, palpating his,  palpating his legs and, like, going, stroking up and down on his thighs, and I'm telling  him, like, no, he just pulled a hamstring.  But, yeah, you're right.  It was, it wasn't Joe.  It was a medic who, the nurse said that.  That's so funny.  He'd just gone to the emergency room.  I got a blood clot.  They're like, you're funny.  You got to go straight to the hospital, get a blood thinner, you know, stat.  So, it's a huge effing deal.  Yeah, yeah.  You weren't afraid that you might give the wrong diagnosis, and when he should go to the 
[03:42:30]  hospital, he didn't?  Good Samaritan law.  If I get sued, I did the best I could.  Good seeing you, brother.  Great seeing you, man.  I love you, Roy.  Thank you, Ken.  I love you, man.  Oh, one more question.  You did the Dr. Ken character on stage, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Stand-up, when I did stand-up comedy, I was Dr. Ken, like Patrice O'Neill.  I met him, like, on the comedy club circuit, and I did BET Comic View, like, three years  in a row.  I was known for that.  So, it was great, man.  I mean, all the instincts I'm doing right now as an actor is only because of the, you 
[03:43:00]  have to cut your teeth doing stand-up to survive and have the instincts you need to, you know,  survive a stage.  Yeah.  It's all, I love, yeah, I'm really proud of my stand-up.  Owning your performance on Community.  Yeah.  That's due to self-medication.  A lot like Chevy.  This is great.  Okay, I see.  I see.  See anybody who's thinking, Ken?  Yes.  Okay, sure.  Talk about what?  Oh, my God.  I totally forgot.  I wanted to ask you, too, one of my favorite people.  Now, is this true?  Michael K. Williams has joined Community? 
[03:43:30]  Yes, he is.  He is the new teacher, the new class.  We're going to biology class now.  He is our teacher.  He's playing, he's an ex-con.  And so, it's kind of, it's so great.  I mean, the fact that he is doing it.  I was so that he agreed to it.  I was like, he's doing it?  So, it's great.  And wait till you see him.  I read what he's going to be doing in the first few scripts, and it's hilarious.  Had you seen The Wire?  I have The Wire on DVD and have watched them backwards and forwards. 
[03:44:00]  Oh, you know the show then.  Okay.  That's a great show.  And not nominated, ever.  We've interviewed all those guys, and it's amazing.  I think they got one writing nomination in season five, but it's amazing that Michael K.  Williams, or any of those, Bunk, or Jamie Hector, never nominated for an acting award, or Bob's  even.  It is a crime.  It should have gotten a Peabody for the things they were doing.  So, yeah.  Show you, Peabody.  But, yeah.  I mean, it's one of those series that, it's like, you know, when, you know, like, something 
[03:44:30]  like the Shawshank Redemption.  It got nominated for Best Picture, and then you never, like, nothing happened.  But then if you look on top ten lists, or like Back to the Future, it's on everyone's  top ten list.  And then you get these movies that, like, when Raging Bull lost to Ordinary People, when  is the last time you saw someone go, like, oh, Ordinary People's on.  I'm just going to watch the rest of it. 
[03:45:00]  Not saying it's a bad movie, but it's one of those things that will, it will live long  forever because of how good it is, and I don't think anyone will, I mean, it doesn't matter  because it's going to live forever as one of the best series ever made.  But they're telling us we have to wrap Joel McHale.  Hey, it was good talking to you, man.  You're a funny guy.  You're a huge star now.  I'm going to the studio in mid-August when I'm there to promote a movie.  We'd love to have you.  Thank you, buddy.  Jim Norton and Sam Roberts, Comic-Con Adventure 2011.  Thank you, Joel McHale. 
[03:45:30]  Jim Norton.  I'm Sam Roberts.  And this is the Virus Comic-Con Wrap-Up, the Comic-Con Adventure.  I don't remember what the name of the show is, but I'm sure it said it in production.  We're just chronicling the adventure that Jim Norton and myself, Sam Roberts, had while  we were at San Diego for Comic-Con just last weekend.  Wilfred is another giant show.  We just heard from Joel McHale from Community.  Wilfred is a show.  It's Elijah Wood's new show, and it's on FX. 
[03:46:00]  You hear about it all the time.  Everybody's talking about it because it's very weird.  It involves Elijah Wood being friends with a guy in a dog suit, but everybody sees it  as a dog, but Elijah sees it as a guy in a suit.  It's a very strange show, but for some reason it works.  A lot of people love it, and that was no different than Comic-Con.  We talked to the cast of Wilfred, including the guy who plays Wilfred, including Elijah  Wood, including one of the lovely females from the show. 
[03:46:30]  So I got to talk to each of them for a few minutes, and this is what it sounded like.  Jim Norton and Sam Roberts, Comic-Con Adventure 2011.  We're here at Comic-Con with Elijah Wood.  Elijah, what's the haps?  No, you know, Comic-Con, yet again.  I was here last year.  I've been here many times.  Is it difficult to promote a show like Wilfred at Comic-Con when there's 100,000 Lord of  the Ring fans downstairs, you know, scurrying about the floor?  Not really. 
[03:47:00]  It's sort of a perfect place to promote the show.  I mean, the great thing about Comic-Con is everyone that's here, they're so pumped for  any kind of content, and a lot of people are obviously coming here for the specific things  that they're fans of, but there's also a lot of just general excitement for what they're  being shown in any capacity.  So it's always a great audience to show people new things to, because they're very receptive  to it.  Especially different things, because Wilfred is a very different show. 
[03:47:30]  Is it nerve-wracking to do this show?  Because it's so different.  I mean, you're a movie star.  You've got a career.  It's not like, you know, you're a first-timer here.  You have a career to worry about, and you're doing this show that's totally different.  Yeah.  I mean, it's been very well-received, I think, so far.  You know, I love it.  A lot of people get it.  But was there a part of you that was like, uh-oh, what if people don't get this?  I don't know, man.  I loved the show so much that regardless of whether people got it or not, I knew it was  something I believed in creatively.  Yeah.  I think it's extremely unique. 
[03:48:00]  It's unlike anything I've seen on television.  It has this really interesting, weird balance between being very funny, but yet there's  something kind of very real happening to these characters.  It's ultimately about a character who's in recovery, so at the very heart of it, there's  something kind of screwed up with him, which is why Wilfred exists in the first place.  So it's, you know, it was exciting to be a part of it.  And whether or not people got it, I mean, we were hopeful, but I never really felt the 
[03:48:30]  sense that it was a risk.  I think we all knew it was a risk, but it was something that we were willing to take  because we thought it was interesting and different, which is what, you know, it's always  what I'm looking for.  I think I'm always just looking for something that's very different from anything I've worked  on.  And it's nice that there are cable outlets doing shows like this now.  Like, USA's doing a lot of shows.  FX, obviously, is doing a lot of these comedies that you don't really see on network TV.  No.  Well, and the fact that FX were the network behind it, too, you know, I knew intrinsically  that it would have, we'd have the creative freedom to make the kind of show that we wanted 
[03:49:00]  to make, which we wouldn't necessarily be able to find on a regular, like, primetime  network, you know?  Years ago, I saw a show on MTV that you were on.  I don't even remember what show it was, but you were in some movie store obsessing over  looking for DVDs and stuff.  Okay.  Yeah.  And it just struck me because you were obsessed with movies.  Yeah.  Are you worried that DVDs are going by the wayside, that everything's going digital?  I don't know if it's so much worried.  I think it's an inevitability.  But does that, like, do you like that?  Does it bum me out?  Yeah.  You know what bums me out is the video store experience. 
[03:49:30]  Yeah.  And that's what you're doing, like, searching through all the...  And that is what's sad.  And it's the same thing that's starting to happen with CD stores falling to the wayside.  Yeah.  However, record stores are becoming very popular now with vinyl.  But, you know, there's a great store in Austin, Texas.  I don't know if you know it.  There's this place called I Love Video.  Mm-hmm.  And it's an amazing store.  They also have a place called Vulcan Video, I think, as well.  And they're great stores. 
[03:50:00]  They're the kind of places that you can go in, and you'll have that personal experience  with the people that work there because they're knowledgeable, and they're fans of film,  and they can recommend things to you.  That's an amazing experience.  And they just got an amazing commercial.  And they did.  You can't replicate that with the digital medium.  That is the one thing that's going to be missed, I think.  You did the Opie and Anthony show on SiriusXM.  Yep.  Not too long ago.  Do you have any idea who Jim Norton is?  Because he's hoping you do, but I seriously doubt that you do.  If you don't, don't lie. 
[03:50:30]  I don't know Jim Norton.  Yes.  Who is Jim Y?  He's the host of the show.  He's a comedian who's on the show, and he sat right next to you.  Oh, the guy right next to me.  Okay.  Yes.  No, you don't know.  I do, I do, I do.  Just not by name.  He was the one.  I don't know him by name.  I'm sorry, Jim.  I'm so sorry.  I was doing a lot of interviews.  No, I know.  People sometimes remember people's names.  Trust me, no is the right answer in this.  But that's unfair.  I see that you were wanting a no.  All right.  Thank you very much.  Thanks, man.  It's Jason Gann from Wilfred.  You're part of this show in Australia. 
[03:51:00]  Bring it to the United States of America.  Was that a risk, do you think?  Because it's a very different show.  Definitely.  When, before the first day of shooting, I'm sitting in my trailer and I'm like, what have  I done?  You know, like, am I about to make a fool of myself in front of the whole world?  You know, it's one thing doing it to a cult following in Australia.  But, um, so it's, it's always a risk and it's a risk for everyone involved in the show.  Me, I guess a little bit more because I'm in the suit. 
[03:51:30]  Yeah.  But, um, you know, I'm incredibly proud of the show and, um, and I, I, I'm a Wilfred fan.  Um, so, I mean, I, I went, after I shot it and I'm watching it, I think every now and  then, oh, that's, that's me.  Yeah, you're just cracking up at yourself.  That's a funny guy.  I don't laugh at many, many things.  And I know if I'm laughing at me, then I'm doing something wrong.  Yeah.  Um, you, you brought this costume to life.  You, you, well, to life.  You're walking around in a dog costume.  Um, we're at Comic Con.  Would it be a dream come true to see, like, little Wilfred's walking around? 
[03:52:00]  Have you seen any?  You haven't seen him?  I haven't seen any dog costumes yet.  There's, I was told there was going to be, there's 95 of them.  90?  They counted?  I've had, yeah, no, they, there's 95 of them together.  I had a photo with them.  Really?  And I was originally told there was going to be 100.  But there was.  And I said, I'm not coming out until there's 100.  Did you bring the suit?  No.  But, I mean, there's 95 and one of you.  Their suits are better than mine.  Really?  Yeah.  But I, I think that should be the case, you know. 
[03:52:30]  Like, whenever you've got a Superman, whenever kids are dressed as Superman, then you've got to  have a crappy suit, you know.  Yeah.  It's got to have, like, baggy underpants that go on the outside of, like.  No muscle definition.  Yeah.  And so, I think that because Wilfred's charm is his bad suit, that any imposter suits should  be really nice and fluffy and cute, and they are.  So, let that be a lesson to all you Wilfred imposters.  Thanks a lot.  Thank you so much.  We're here with Fiona Goobelman.  Goobelman.  Yeah.  It's a tongue twister.  From Wilfred.  Now, Fiona, a name like Goobelman, kids growing up would make fun of. 
[03:53:00]  Oh, yeah.  But it seems like you're good looking enough that you could pull it off.  Is that kind of how it went down?  You know, Goobelman is, you know, my whole life I definitely got teased.  And, but I just, I don't know, what can you do?  It's your name.  And I would just laugh it off.  And now some of my favorite nicknames, I still get called from my last name.  And people, when I first started acting, were like, oh, you should change your name.  You should change your name.  It's weird.  And this.  And I was like, no way.  It's hilarious.  And I've actually, I swear, booked jobs because I walk in and they're like, Goobelman? 
[03:53:30]  From like, right?  Well, they're not going to forget.  You know, yeah.  And you can't forget that name.  Well, look, it's like people, people teased you.  People said you should change your name.  And now you're on a hit show.  So.  You know what?  You can make it with a name like Goobelman.  Yeah, obviously.  So, Wilfred, when you first got the job and you started, you know, really figuring out what it was, were you like, what is this show?  Yeah, well, when I first got the script, I read it.  And I was like, oh, my God, this is so funny. 
[03:54:00]  It's so witty.  I love it.  But what's going on with this dog guy in the suit?  What?  I did not get it.  And then I went that night and watched some clips from the Australian version.  And I was like, oh, my God, this is genius.  This is amazing.  And so I went back and reread the script.  So I read it twice before my first audition.  And I just loved it so much that I was like, I have to be a part of this show.  And I think my excitement just paid away.  Any nerves based on, like you said, you saw the script and you were like, what is this show? 
[03:54:30]  Like, this is weird.  Were you nervous that people would see the commercials and be like, I'm not going to watch this?  I thought our advertising campaign for Wilfred was genius.  I thought they did such an incredible job.  I loved all the spots we shot, you know, because it wasn't clips from the show.  It was just these random, funny little things where you're like, what is that?  Look, I was watching American Idol and I saw Elijah Wood sitting next to a guy in a dog suit.  And I was like, I have to figure out what this is about.  Yeah, exactly.  And so I think it was actually very smart of them, very clever to do that because they 
[03:55:00]  were funny and they caught people's attention and they got them interested in knowing what  it was about.  Because I think it's like when I tried to explain the show to people, they're like, their  face, you know, goes from a smile to kind of like, oh, it's great for you.  And so until people see it, they just don't, I don't think they quite get it.  But I think once you watch the show a few times and you really get it, then it's just.  Is it fun to do a show that's so different?  Oh my, it's amazing. 
[03:55:30]  I always dreamt of being on a dark comedy.  And so to be on a show like that, I mean, that's, it really is a dream come true.  And I love being on something that's unique and refreshing where I'm excited to read the  scripts and I am like, what's going to happen next?  Or what great lines are going to be thrown in there?  And, you know, I'll see an episode and on the third time I catch a joke I never saw before.  So that's just, it's great.  Obviously, we're here at Comic-Con.  Comic-Con.  You can tell.  There's a lot of wonderful people who come to Comic-Con. 
[03:56:00]  At the same time, there are a lot of people who may not be the most social people in the  world.  What's the creepiest thing that's happened to you since you've been here?  You know, I honestly haven't had anything creepy happen to me yet.  So just this interview then?  Yeah, this, I'm very, I'm very, no, no, no, no, really.  The funniest thing, though, I'll tell you, was, so we just came from the signing booth  and Dorian, who plays Elijah's sister on the show, she and I were kind of, we're at the 
[03:56:30]  front of the line.  And this girl kind of walked by and we were like, oh, did you want us to sign that?  And she's like, no.  And then, and then Randall's sitting right next to us.  He's the director.  And he's like, oh, no, they're, they're on the show.  They're the female leads.  And, and she's like, no, I don't, I don't want it.  She wanted to, she wanted all the guys to sign it.  And we were like, okay.  So that was funny.  Well, you'll, you'll, eventually you'll be giant stars too.  And then she'll be sad.  You know, it was so amazing getting to meet people that watch a show and love it and to 
[03:57:00]  hear that.  It does feel rewarding, doesn't it?  Yeah, it's, it's like being, cause you know, in your theater.  People are laughing or they laugh like that.  They're applauding or laughing.  Plus you get to see all these fans and say people, I've seen the numbers, but people  really are.  These are real people watching.  I don't, yeah.  To see the people excited.  That's the best thing.  Awesome.  Well, it was a pleasure talking to you.  Best of luck.  Nice to meet you.  Have a great day.  You too.  Jim Norton and Sam Roberts, Comic-Con Adventure 2011.  All right.  It's Sam Roberts here for Jim Norton, who would be here with me, but he's far too big and too 
[03:57:30]  famous to host a show like this.  We're chronicling our Comic-Con adventure.  You just heard me talking to the cast of Wilfred.  Uh, and that was also the moment where if you can, uh, you can go back on my Twitter and  find the picture, the screen grab, if you really want to see it.  But I ended up, uh, sneaking my Weasley way into the back of a G4 shot.  And apparently a lot of you watched G4 because I got a lot of Twitter comments on that.  And I appreciate it. 
[03:58:00]  Uh, Comic-Con is not just about the celebrities you meet, though.  It's about the people.  The real celebrities of Comic-Con are the people that show up, the fans.  And, uh, I didn't think I could, was capable of interviewing the fans.  Jim Norton said, he also said, he said, I can't do it, Sam.  I don't want to interview these people.  I, I, I don't feel like I'm, I'm worthy of that.  I'm not where I should be as an interviewer.  And I felt the same way.  We searched high and low and we were able to find one man who was willing to interview 
[03:58:30]  some of the people at Comic-Con.  That man is named Lyle Chip Chipperson.  Yes!  Chip Chipperson on the floor of Comic-Con.  And if Chip is somebody who, uh, gets under your skin,  see how long you can listen to this without tapping out.  To me, it's all hilarious.  It's Chip Chipperson on the floor of the San Diego Comic-Con.  Right here on The Virus.  Jim Norton and Sam Roberts, Comic-Con Adventure 2011.  I sound like a 12-year-old when I'm on camera. 
[03:59:00]  Ah, that's okay.  Uh, we're just interviewing people for Comic-Con.  Are you having a good time or something?  I am.  It's been great.  What's your name?  My name is Summer.  Summer?  Oh, it's a good time here.  It is.  Um, are you saucy Princess Leia?  Yes.  You got a boyfriend?  I have 5'15".  Is he, like, who is he?  He plays, he dresses up as Boba Fett.  Who?  Also from Star Wars.  He dresses up as Boba.  Bob Fett?  Boba. 
[03:59:30]  Oh, he was, like, the bounty hunter or something, right?  Oh, is he?  Where's Boba Fett?  I like him.  He's not here today.  How come?  You had to work.  I had a chain like that one time.  I was chaining my bike up with it.  It doesn't work for that.  No, it's too loose.  I don't know what to ask.  Oh, look, the guy's got, like, lobsters on his face or something.  Alien.  Oh.  Let me ask.  Hey, what's... 
[04:00:00]  It looks like you got, like, red lobster or something.  It's an alien facehugger.  What's that?  It's an alien facehugger.  From the movie Aliens.  I've seen the movie Alien Abduction.  Close.  Close enough.  Take it back to your body.  Oh, that's like a ray gun or something, right?  Yeah.  Fits the whole suit.  That's cool.  Does it make a noise?  I had a ray gun when I was a kid.  Really?  Yeah, I would always point it at the girls. 
[04:00:30]  Make them take off their clothes and stuff and rape them.  Not a good idea.  Not a good idea.  Hi, I'm Chip.  Oh, hi, what's your name?  I'm Chip.  Hi, Chip.  Oh, look at you.  You got your tie.  It looks like you're going back to school or something.  No, I was just expelled from school.  I did, too.  We're Hogwarts harlots, and we've been expelled.  Me and my friend Teddy got caught in the closet when I was a kid.  How'd that work out for you?  We got yelled at.  Where are you from or something? 
[04:01:00]  We're from here, San Diego.  Oh, you're from San Diego?  Is this your first time at Comical Con?  Yes, it is.  What are you?  Are you supposed to be the ladies from Hogwarts?  Yeah, we're Hogwarts bad girls.  What's bad?  Uh-oh.  We're too cool for school.  We're too hot for school.  Yeah, I was too hot for school, too.  I would put on the air conditioning.  They could use something like that in here.  Yeah.  There's a lot of ugly people here.  Look at that guy's hat.  I hope he gets shot. 
[04:01:30]  I hope he gets shot.  I was just kidding.  He likes when I say mean stuff about people.  Are you having a good time?  Yes.  Oh, look at this.  The person's all yellow.  Looks like they fell into some lemonade or something.  He's like a Power Ranger.  Oh, wow.  A lot of camel toe.  I think that's definitely a girl, yeah.  Yeah, I think so, too.  I hope so.  Otherwise, he's got a little one. 
[04:02:00]  All right.  We'll see you guys later.  I'll talk to you.  I'm just riffing.  I'm just joking around or something.  Please continue to move.  It's a firehouse.  Okay.  We're just doing like a little interview.  Are you having a good time, sir, at Comical Con?  Please, sir.  I'm going to have to ask you to move aside.  Thank you.  Keep moving.  Keep moving, folks.  I'm trying to do my interviews and jokes.  There's too many cripples here.  Everybody's in wheelchairs and stuff.  They shouldn't let them in.  Tell this guy to be quiet.  Because they're all in a chair, running over people's toes. 
[04:02:30]  They should just make them sit in the sun and bake like a bunch of raisins.  And over here, look at the Lionsgate.  They should say, what do you see outside a lion's house?  Lionsgate.  Bodies just keep going.  I don't care.  Hi.  Can we interview you?  Wow, that's really cool.  What's your name?  My name's Savannah.  Looks like you ate a bunch of blueberries or something.  Yeah, pretty much.  What's that supposed to be?  I'm Mystique from X-Men.  Mystique? 
[04:03:00]  Mystique.  Oh, it looks like, wow, that's really cool.  Is that paint?  Yes, it's body paint, yeah.  How do you get that off?  Um, a really, really hot shower.  Oh, yeah, I take a lot of cold showers, though, because you know what I'm saying.  What's your name?  I'm Leah.  Hi, are you having fun?  Yeah, I am.  It's really fun here.  There's a lot of big, fat people here.  I hate them.  You said it, not me.  I know, it bugs me, though, and they're all fat and stuff. 
[04:03:30]  Don't you hate that?  No, not really, no.  That's why you should say that you're blue, because they stepped on your feet or something.  Oh, there you go, yeah.  Exactly.  How long did it take you to do that?  Probably like two hours, right?  Yeah, like two hours.  And you just put it, you didn't put it all over yourself, right?  Not, not everywhere, no.  Yeah, not, you know.  Yeah, not everywhere.  But, yeah.  How come you didn't dress up?  You just got your shirt on.  She has spark ears.  Yeah. 
[04:04:00]  I didn't even, let me see that.  Oh, could you get that with the camera?  It looks like you're trying to listen to something in Timbuktu or something.  That's real pointy and stuffy ears.  Yeah.  You should probably jab somebody right in the eye like that.  Yeah, there you go.  Yeah, just take their fucking eyes out.  All these fat people.  Well, it's nice to meet you.  Thank you very much.  Have a good comical, kind.  Where is this going to be?  It's on Chipper TV on YouTube.  Chipper TV.  C-H-I-P-P-A-H. 
[04:04:30]  Chipper.  Do you guys have like a card?  We had one, but we gave a bunch of Malcolm Steven Spielberg with you and Bruce Williston.  Okay.  Very cool.  Well, thank you guys.  These are easy.  Hi, how are you?  Good, how are you?  I'm okay, I'm Chip.  What's the kind of gun is that?  It's a blaster.  And a blaster?  And what do you use that for?  To kill people. 
[04:05:00]  Where are you from?  Star Wars.  You're from Star Wars?  Is that like a place to stop?  I'm from a park of lifts.  What have you heard the movie of?  What?  How old are you?  21.  21?  Oh, so you just started drinking?  Yeah.  Wink, wink.  What's your name?  Mariah.  Hi, I'm Chipper.  I like your chain or something.  Is that like a real bike chain?  I had one like that and my friends used to whip me with it.  What's my back? 
[04:05:30]  It's plastic.  Oh.  I had a bike chain one time and my friend Bruce took it off and he was whipping my back and  told the police to stop.  That sounds like it would hurt.  Yeah.  Do you come with a bunch?  Is there a bunch of guys that you like here?  Because they're all dressed up as different people.  Um, I came with a group of people.  Oh, did you guys drive or take a bus?  We drove.  Oh, we took a plane.  Yeah.  Um, I think my group's leaving though, so.  I'm sorry.  Have a fun time at Comical Con. 
[04:06:00]  Bye bye.  It's nice talking to you.  That chick wanted to fuck me so bad.  She was getting all wet and sloppy.  Jim Norton and Sam Roberts Comic Con Adventure 2011.  Thank you, Chip.  I mean, the Comic Con floor was just full of individuals.  I'm Sam Roberts.  There were over 100,000 people at this thing.  And, uh, I guess we got a handful of them.  But, I mean, just everybody in a little costume.  Everybody just had a great time.  So, uh, you can't blame them for that. 
[04:06:30]  But there were more celebrities that we still have to get to.  And, uh, and one guy is a guy who he shows up at Comic Con and these are his people.  I mean, he runs this place.  He was called the mayor of Comic Con by the guy who interviewed him before me.  I'm not nearly clever enough to think of something like that to call him.  So, instead, we just reference that interview even though we have no record of it.  I guess you'll hear it all.  It's Bruce Campbell.  The man from the Evil Dead trilogy. 
[04:07:00]  He was promoting, uh, Burn Notice, The Fall of Sam Axe.  His Burn Notice spinoff movie.  Which, I mean, to be involved with that many successful projects over such a long period of time  is something that doesn't happen too often in Hollywood.  And to have fans that are as loyal as the Bruce Campbell fans are,  well, it's a sight to behold.  This is my time with Bruce Campbell from Comic Con 2011.  Jim Norton and Sam Roberts, Comic Con Adventure 2011.  Sam Roberts here with the legendary Bruce Campbell at Comic Con. 
[04:07:30]  What's going on?  Bruce, what's the haps?  The haps are Comic Con, man.  And it's the beast that rolls into town.  Yeah.  Like locusts.  You're here promoting, uh, Burn Notice, The Fall of Sam Axe.  Yep.  The tragic story.  The prequel story of Sam's last mission as a real soldier.  Did you realize when you signed up for Burn Notice you'd be such a hit that you'd be getting spinoff movies?  Yes.  Okay.  Good to know.  Well, it's good to have confidence.  I was also...  It's just truth.  It's not confidence? 
[04:08:00]  No, it's not arrogance or confidence.  When you just know, you know.  I see.  Like you, today.  You just know that this is going to be an amazing interview.  Is that just my vibe right now?  Yeah, you feel it.  I feel it right now.  You know, you come...  Part of the vibe is the way you look.  You run Comic Con, pretty much.  You're a god around here.  Well, as the mayor.  Yeah, that's what I said in the last interview.  You're the mayor of Comic Con.  You could come here looking like a schlub if you wanted to.  No, no, because that's the job of the fans.  Just come here looking like schlubs.  Yeah.  No, my job is to counteract the lack of effort they put into those camouflage cargo shorts. 
[04:08:30]  You are dressed to the nines.  How long did it take you to pick out this ensemble?  Nine minutes.  Really?  No wonder you're so...  Actually, the wardrobe department from Burn Notice did it.  They costumed you for this?  It's a cool thing.  It's like the old days, you know.  Like, Clark Gable could go into MGM and go,  I need an outfit for tonight, kid.  And they would make him an outfit.  So I'd come into the wardrobe department and say,  Comic Con.  Yeah.  I need something.  Two words, Comic Con.  Your Burn Notice has been such a hit.  It's had quite a cult phenomenon.  How happy are you that finally there's something that people can talk about in minutia with 
[04:09:00]  you that's not the Evil Dead trilogy?  Oh, it's always good.  You know, if you stick around long enough, you can get involved in other stuff.  Yeah.  This came out of nowhere.  And it's fun to just do a different character that doesn't have a chainsaw attached to his arm.  How have you managed to survive this long in this business?  Just don't go away.  Just stay relevant in some way.  I don't know.  That's the secret.  Don't leave.  Don't leave.  Hi.  Still here.  Sorry, guys.  Still here.  All right.  Well, thanks a lot, Bruce. 
[04:09:30]  All right, sir.  Thank you.  It was a pleasure.  Jim Norton and Sam Roberts Comic Con Adventure 2011.  Thank you very much.  That was Bruce Campbell.  I'm Sam Roberts.  And this is the chronicling of the adventure that Jim Norton and myself had at this year's  San Diego Comic Convention.  It doesn't stop.  No, sir.  It doesn't stop.  The Mythbusters.  You talk about science fiction.  How about just science?  They're a group of people who have managed to take a show that is science-based and turn 
[04:10:00]  it into something that is entertaining enough for a mainstream audience.  I mean, Danny, our own Danny from the Opie and Anthony show, he loves the Mythbusters.  Jim got to sit down with Carrie Byron, as well as Grant and Tori from the show, to talk  about the show and also to bring up something that Danny had tweeted to Carrie Byron.  When I say Danny loves the show, I mean he loves the show, but his desire, shall we say, 
[04:10:30]  for Carrie Byron doesn't just go beyond creepy.  It sort of gets to the point where you might want to call authorities on the whole thing  because you don't know how far he'll take it.  He's not a guy who knows when to say when, especially when it comes to matters of the  heart.  And that's how he feels about Carrie Byron.  This is the Mythbusters with Sir Jim Norton on our Comic-Con recap.  Jim Norton and Sam Roberts' Comic-Con Adventure 2011. 
[04:11:00]  All right, so you guys are Emmy-nominated.  Is this the first Emmy nomination?  No, this is our third year in a row, and we still haven't won.  We're hoping that this is our year.  Well, everyone says, oh, it's so nice.  I mean, it is nice to be nominated, but man, I'm sure it would be great to win.  Well, who has beaten you?  Well, that's not a very nice question.  I wouldn't say beat us.  It's just that it was their year.  Intervention, Jamie Oliver's Food Nation, I think, won one year.  But what, you don't like food?  No, I think you guys should win. 
[04:11:30]  Well, thank you very much.  I think you guys should win.  I think it's crooked, and somebody's probably paying off other people.  I think you should be winning.  I think it's just an honor to be able to wear a fancy dress.  See, but that's why she's successful, and I'm mediocre, because you say the right things.  I would just go, ah, fuck everybody else.  You guys are smart, and you say the right things.  Is it disappointing to lose?  I mean, obviously it is, right?  Oh, yeah.  Well, you know, you always go in hoping to win, but you know what?  The competition is really hard. 
[04:12:00]  There's a lot of great shows, and this year, actually, Deadliest Catch is nominated, and  I think they're a really strong contender.  What do you think it is that determines, okay, we're going to give it to this show and not  this show?  Because you guys have been doing such original stuff for so long.  I mean, you're part of the culture.  Everybody knows Mythbusters.  Everybody knows what it is you do.  I mean, you had President Obama did one of your shows.  Yeah, you know what I think it is?  It's usually the shows that are saving lives, getting people off of drugs or alcohol, or  getting little fat kids to stop eating so much. 
[04:12:30]  Oh, no.  No.  Little kids who are overweight.  Can we edit that?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Little kids who are overweight, or shows about little kids who are overweight and helping  them not eat unhealthy.  Yeah.  Although, you're right, though.  Saying little fat kids is not bad, because that's what it is.  It's kids who are not eating healthy, and if it's helping them lose weight, it's seen  as a public service, I guess.  Yeah, right.  But then again, what you guys do is also a public service.  I mean, you're showing people that certain things that people think are myths are actually 
[04:13:00]  dangerous, and certain things that you think would be dangerous are actually not at all  dangerous.  Yeah, you know, the questions that keep people up at night, like, do girls fart, and is driving  sleepy more dangerous than driving drunk.  You know, really important stuff.  Now, did you really do it on the girls fart?  No, it actually never aired on Discovery.  Maybe they thought it was too embarrassing, so it's on the internet, unfortunately.  But yes, I showed up to work one day, and they gave me a pair of underwear with a microphone 
[04:13:30]  and a hydrogen sulfide meter in the area, and it was linked to the PA system in the shop.  It was quite a day.  And did they feed you a certain amount of food or a certain, you know, diet?  Well, after a while, you know, it took a really long time.  I don't know if I was nervous, but it, you know, they wanted me to eat cabbage or beans  or that sort of thing after a while.  But I ended up producing in the end, so.  What food did it? 
[04:14:00]  That's a girl.  What a great way of saying that.  That actually, so what food did it for you?  I mean, for me, McDonald's.  Bad news.  Bad news.  Yeah, we're not having this conversation.  Now, do you think somebody did that as a goof, or they really thought maybe this will  make the error, and just at the end they went, eh.  You mean, are they just mean?  Are they just pranking me?  Yeah, just something silly to do.  That's totally possible.  Yeah, I think that's a great idea.  I mean, I never knew it was a real mystery.  Were you shocked to learn the truth?  Yeah.  I was not shocked to learn the truth, but, I mean, it was a full episode. 
[04:14:30]  It had been edited.  It was incorporated into what was going to be the final show, and then last minute  they pulled the plug and said, mm, not so much, and had to re-edit the show.  Now, did you guys, when President Obama did the show, did any of you guys get to meet him?  No.  I didn't see the episode.  Who was he actually there with?  Or was it nobody?  Was he not actually in the facility?  Jamie and Adam actually went to the White House and did the opening to the show with  him, so he didn't actually come to our set.  So we didn't get to meet him. 
[04:15:00]  Now, you guys come here every year.  You're a pretty big feature at Comic-Con.  Your panels sell out, or I should say are full every time?  Yeah, actually.  These are our people.  These are the geeks.  These are our fans.  So we come here, and they appreciate us.  We really like this.  What do you like about Comic-Con?  I mean, obviously, it's great to get the adoration, but what do you find here that you don't find  in other places?  Well, I mean, for us, we actually get to meet our fans.  We're pretty insulated.  Our shop is not in Hollywood with all the celebrities.  And for us, it's just, we have a basically blue-collar job. 
[04:15:30]  We show up every day.  We get dirty.  We go home at the same time.  So to come out to Comic-Con and kind of realize that we're on TV and meet our fans and see  the effect that we have on them is really wonderful.  What was the first time you realized, like, wow, I'm a celebrity, I'm famous, or I'm well  known by people who probably never would have known me?  I still don't see celebrity.  No, you are, though.  I mean, you are.  Even though your attitude doesn't make you seem like a celebrity because you're very nice  and down to earth, but by definition, you are one.  What was the first time you realized, like, wow, people know who I am? 
[04:16:00]  When I got invited on the Opie and Anthony show, I was like, I have made it.  Is she good or what?  She really is.  You're a great actress, too, because nobody thinks they're famous and they get invited  on the Opie and Anthony show.  That's usually the end of a career.  People are like, I'm on my way out the door.  I would, yeah.  Now, Danny, obviously, on our show.  Now, what has Danny been pestering you to do?  Besides the obvious.  Oh, I think he actually has been on the Twitter trying to get people to get, 
[04:16:30]  an autograph of some artwork from one of the booths, but I haven't been able to make it.  Has he asked you?  Yes.  He actually would like to come visit the set.  I've invited him.  I said we'd give him a tour.  Yeah, what a horrible mistake that is.  You know that, right?  You know, I gave you a tour, so I figured, you know, we have to invite him.  But you know that I'm a nice guy.  I'm not creepy.  Danny's got, like, a creepy love for you, and he'll just lurk around and he'll quote  every episode.  He'll really bug you.  Me and Kenny came by after we went to San Quentin.  Yeah, but you showed up in sweatpants.  How creepy is that?  Fair point. 
[04:17:00]  You know what?  We had a strip club or something?  Well, almost.  I mean, we took a tour of San Quentin.  One of the guards is a fan.  And they said you can't wear jeans.  So I guess because it resembles too much what the convicts wear, so we have to wear sweatpants.  So I wore sweatpants, and I didn't realize that that would be really creepy to show up  in a pair of sweats.  So my apologies.  Well, you know, hopefully Danny will show up in, like, a three-piece suit and offset all  the creepiness that you brought.  And stop asking her to do stuff for you, stupid.  She's busy. 
[04:17:30]  All right.  Thank you guys very much.  Hey, good luck.  I actually hope you win the Emmy.  Thank you.  Good seeing you again.  Good seeing you again.
