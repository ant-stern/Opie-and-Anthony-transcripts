<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a furious segment centered on co-host Sam Roberts' purchase of a 19-inch television.  Opie and Anthony relentlessly mocked the small screen size, contrasting it with Anthony's own 65-inch TV and making numerous jokes about Sam's perceived cheapness, especially given his recent move. Sam defended his purchase, citing budgetary concerns. Listener calls added to the ridicule, with the conversation veering off into discussions of the New York Jets, the Cleveland Browns game, and various NFL players, including highly offensive commentary about the Jets' kicker and praise, laced with racial commentary, for Peyton Hillis.

The show then transitioned to a heated debate about a controversial Hail Mary play in an NFL game, involving multiple interpretations of the rules from the hosts, callers (including a former football coach and a New Jersey high school football official), and punctuated by profanity.  Further tangents emerged, covering the sports commentary's sanitized language, Tiger Woods, movie ratings and a website detailing offensive movie content, a TV show about a person transitioning genders, childhood fears of kidnapping, an unusual sexual practice described by a caller, and an upcoming interview with Russell Simmons.  The hosts also promoted Simmons' upcoming appearance, commenting on his stance on removing offensive language from rap music.

Next, the focus shifted to intern Stevie, whose disrespectful behavior and a prank involving Derek's credit card were recounted in detail.  Stevie's unconvincing apologies were met with derision.  This segment led directly into the arrival of Russell Simmons.  The conversation with Simmons covered a range of topics: his preference for Blackberries over iPhones, his business ventures (including Unirush), charitable work, the challenges in the banking industry, his past music career,  his vegan lifestyle and yoga practice, his views on sex and relationships, and his reality show, "Running Russell Simmons," on Oxygen,  including details about  guests like Amber Rose, Reggie Bush, and Reverend Run, and a specific incident involving an assistant flashing T.I.

The show then returned to the escalating conflict between intern Stevie and producer Derek,  with a played audio clip of Derek's furious outburst demanding Stevie's firing.  The hosts discussed Stevie's repeated poor judgment, comparing him unfavorably with other interns, including sexually explicit anecdotes about Tom and other interns. As a punishment, the hosts sent Stevie on a mission to a soul food restaurant and a cheesecake shop using the subway.  The segment also included discussion of intern Troy and his interactions with Stevie and a woman they both slept with.  Further attempts to mediate between Stevie and Derek ended in a chaotic scene of Stevie grovelling, ending with a potential firing hanging in the air.  The segment concluded with discussion of one host's upcoming stand-up show, Billy Ray Cyrus's divorce (with an audio clip of a contentious interview), and a video of a heated altercation between a mail carrier and a woman.

The final segment focused on a viral video showing a confrontation between a Black man and a white woman, with the woman making offensive statements about Black men, Black women, and IQ levels. The hosts and callers discussed the video, with one caller defending the woman as an "entitled bitch".  The location of the incident (possibly Hingham, Massachusetts) was mentioned, along with a brief reference to a caller from Cleveland. The show concluded with a wrap-up of the day’s broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony are no strangers to scandal  Opie and Anthony on satellite radio  Satellite radio  Apparently Opie and Anthony are dicks  Oh, here they go again  Fun, dopey radio show  Not just any radio show  A radio show that inspires beyond your wildest dream  The show is a lot funnier on any W  The show's host, Anthony Camilla and Greg Opie  Six years without getting fired, a new record for us  It's just astounding to me  I didn't even want to say it's racist, but god damn 
[00:00:30]  This show will rock as best as we could possibly do this radio show  I'm gonna go home and whack to a tranny later  There you go, alright  We just lost our demo, man  What's wrong with you?  Is this the last draw for the watching radio duo?  The Opie and Anthony show  The most popular show in the history of satellite radio  But enough of this palaver  Let's get the show on the road  Yeah  Sam just pissed everyone off  Sam's an idiot  We got a lot to do 
[00:01:00]  We want to talk football and all sorts of shit  But Sam's bragging about a 19-inch TV that he just bought  Because he moved Friday  I'm just saying I upgraded  He had the Nageltron, if you remember  He got his TV from Eric Nagel  And he called it the Nageltron  3000  And it was a CRT monitor  Like a CRT television  Old school TV  Big heavy behemoths  Right, the only reason you didn't bring it to the new place  Is because you can't move it  It's too heavy  I didn't want to deal with it  Oh, you moved already  Yeah, so 
[00:01:30]  The last  Sam tweeted a picture of the Nageltron  Just laying in the empty apartment  As in  I'm out of this old place  Yeah  I'm leaving the Nageltron behind  And I thought that was a very good sign for Sam Roberts  Yeah, that he was upgrading  Out with the old  And in with the new  Then he tweets sometime late Saturday, I think  Maybe early Sunday  I don't remember  Yeah  That he got a brand new TV  I'm like, alright  Sam's moving up in the world  Yes  It's enraging  16.9  You got a 16.9  Oh yeah, widescreen  You know, so you can now watch TV shows in HD and stuff 
[00:02:00]  And he gets a 19-inch television  Why would you get a 19-inch TV?  That's a computer monitor  It's a good deal  It's very inexpensive  It's only $180  You get what you pay for  What's wrong with you?  That's exactly  You know what that is  What is it?  It's that cheapskate thing  That you inherited from your dad  Yep, he's a cheapskate  Bobby would have gave you money for a bigger TV  I don't know if she would have  $180 on a TV?  Yeah, it's only $180 
[00:02:30]  And eventually  Poor people have bigger TVs than you said  Oh, they absolutely do  Dude, it costs more to get jerked off  Right  Than his television  That's right  That's a good deal  When I was making absolutely no money in radio  I always made sure I had at least a really nice TV  That's all I cared about  A nice TV and a car that ran  Not a nice car  A car that ran and a really nice TV  That's all I cared about  Well, one day if we want to get a bigger TV for the living room  Then we can still move this one to the bedroom  One day you had your shot  Yeah, that was your chance 
[00:03:00]  How far away is your couch from the 19-inch TV?  The couch must be six feet away  And can you see, like, the crawl on CNN and Fox News or anything?  Well, I don't have cable hooked up yet, but  Oh, no  It would be difficult  What do you mean you don't have cable?  So what are you watching?  Like, DVDs?  Blu-rays, my friend  Blu-rays  That's the new thing  It don't matter if you have Blu-rays if you have a tiny TV  Exactly  Watch them on your iPhone  Why would you do this? 
[00:03:30]  Just put your iPhone up on your TV stand  No, it does  You connect it, HDMI  His TV has apps on it  It sucks  Where's the picture of this TV for everybody?  Twitter.com slash NotSam  Yeah  We're looking at the picture  And it was hard to kind of get a perspective on the brand new  What do you call on this TV?  The Roberts Vision 5000  The Roberts Vision 5000  And then you see the cable box and realize how tiny this TV is  The cable box is wider than the fucking TV  And then the PlayStation is taller 
[00:04:00]  Yeah, that's what I was about to mention, too  It looks like something out of Gulliver's Travels  It's fucking horrible  Yeah, it's just  And it's a tiny little TV on a stand that's meant for a much bigger television  The scented candle is almost half the size of the television  Yeah, yeah  You did this just to get on the radio, which is fine  But now you're stuck with a tiny TV after this break is over  How much was the next bigger size?  23?  We already asked this question  Go ahead, tell me  It would have been an extra 100 bucks  To get what?  A 24 inch?  A 22 inch was like $270 
[00:04:30]  They're that cheap now?  Fucking plastic  Exactly  Thank you, Jimmy  How much would a 30 inch have been?  Over $300  Alright, so pay the over $300  By the way, did I see rabbit ears?  No  Rabbit ears don't work anyway  What is that that was on the left side?  That's the lamp  It's a small desk lamp  Can we see his lamp?  It's bright  It's very bright  It's washing out  It's kind of washing out because it's on 
[00:05:00]  How does your chick deal with this?  Is she furious?  No, she said she thought it was a good  She also doesn't like to spend a lot of money  So she thought it was a good thing  This isn't like spending a lot of money  Yeah, it is  The frugal couple  That's not spending a lot of money  32 inch Emerson TV for $198  42 inch  He got ripped off  42 inch Emerson  1080p  What is yours?  720p?  720p  Yeah, 1080p for $398 
[00:05:30]  Why didn't you shop around, Sam Roberts?  That's an extra $200  That's nothing for 42 inch  That's what you paid for  $200 is nothing  He's buying at the worst time  We're two weeks away from the holiday season  From the big sales  I gotta watch something  You couldn't have picked a worse time to buy  You could have bought on black  Wouldn't there be deals on black Friday?  All those deals  Yeah, but I need a television now  I have an apartment now  Yeah, but so spend the extra $100 or $200  It's worth it  Exactly  What's wrong with you?  I don't  You're gonna make money one of these days 
[00:06:00]  Does that bother you?  32 inch  720p for $198  $18 more  You saved $18  $18 more  But I have to wait till black Friday  Plus, first of all  Black Friday's  I still paid less  A week and a half away  Yeah, but I'm not gonna sit there  Looking at a TV stand for a week and a half  So wait, you won't miss a week of TV  But you'll sacrifice your whole future life of fun TV for $200?  It doesn't make sense  This will be an upgrade because it's in HD  Unlike the Nageltron  Plus you just sacrifice  You pull all your money out of the bank and get a nice big TV  No way  Plus Jess and me, you split it 
[00:06:30]  So that's only $90  Oh my god  God, you made her fucking buy half the tiny TV  Half a tiny little TV  It's 90 bucks to each of us  That's nothing  Shit  That's less than $100 each, so  Well, you should've went $100 each  You could've gotten the TV twice the size  Anthony, do you know that I upgraded my TV this weekend as well?  Oh, did you?  Just a nice little comparison  That Sam Roberts got a 19 inch TV  And I decided to replace my 52 inch TV in my living room  With a 65 inch TV 
[00:07:00]  Wow  65 inches  65 inch  What do you need it?  My picture in picture is bigger than your fucking TV  His pip  My pip is bigger than your 19 inch  It might be bigger  It might be bigger  But you don't need it  Well, I wanted to move my couch all the way back to my windows  And I figured I couldn't really  I didn't feel comfortable with the 52 inch  I wanted something bigger so I could not  65, dude?  Keep the couches way back  You gotta see the box it came in  Fucking massive  The building is really mad at me 
[00:07:30]  They've never seen a box bigger for a TV  I would like to see it  65 inch  You can sleep in it  Yeah  But now I'm bummed that I didn't get the 70  Because I think I could've fit a 70 in that spot  Can you bring it back?  You just got it  Send it back  I'm thinking  Send it back  I'm thinking maybe  It was a project to get this mounted  And all that shit  What did you do with the old TV?  That's now my bedroom  And then the bedroom TV  What happened was the bedroom TV went out  So I upgraded and moved everything forward  Wait, wait, wait  You mount  Is it on the wall or is it in something? 
[00:08:00]  You can't hang  That's too heavy to hang  What?  The 70 inch?  The 65?  You can hang anything  Oh no, they got double bracket  Fucking  Yeah, you can hang anything  This thing  And I can pull it out and move it  Yeah  If I'm over here, I just like move it to the right  My 19 incher, I can hang like a picture frame  With just like some string on a hook  Yeah  No problem  You're an idiot  Sam, I make money now  But when I was your age making no money  I made sure I had a big TV always  How are you going to watch wrestling on a 19 inch TV?  Oh really?  Now think about it 
[00:08:30]  I'll be able to watch wrestling on a 19 incher  Are you going to be real close?  Like are you going to pull a little chair up?  I might have to sit on the ottoman  On the what?  The ottoman  The ottoman?  What the fuck is that?  An ottoman?  A small car in your fucking living room?  An ottoman is like  Put your feet on, right?  Yeah, it's what you put your feet on  No, it's an ottoman  An ottoman  There's no U in it or A  There isn't any U?  I thought he pronounced it perfectly  I love reading about the Ottoman Empire  I love Otto and George  Otto Preminger 
[00:09:00]  Everyone is coming up with deals for you  So happy  $200 for a 26 inch computer monitor  Yeah, but it's a computer monitor  I want a television  You'll hook a fucking computer monitor  You'll hook a TV up  Do you know what the difference between a computer monitor and a television?  Do they have three HDMIs?  Yeah  They do?  There's just no tuner card inside of a monitor  Yeah, I need it  What am I going to get?  I need a tuner card  Sam, really?  What's going on?  What are you doing?  I need a TV  This is really annoying  I need a TV  Did you get two TVs and you're just fucking pulling a guy for everybody?  No, I swear to God 
[00:09:30]  Did you Photoshop that as a real big TV?  No  But then you made it look small?  The living room has the 19 inch HD  And the bedroom still has the old Quasar built in VCR  Quasar?  I've had the Quasar since college  With a built in VCR  What are you doing?  He's a cheapskate  And what's the brand of the new TV?  Insignia  An insignia  That thing's going to be just smoldering  It's so thin  In a week  Don't leave it on for more than an hour  Just give it like a fucking Mac laptop  And you fucking put it to sleep 
[00:10:00]  And it gets hot  Sam, what the fuck, man  You upgraded your apartment  And you buy a tiny TV  Well, I've got to pay $200 more  We, combined, have to pay $200 more per month rent  Yeah  Jess, you know, $100 to me, $100 to Jess  But, so I can't be spending money on new things  Tell Bobby your situation  She would sneak some money in an envelope for you  Your mom would  She would  She used to do that in college  Your mom would have taken care of you  I know your dad is frugal  That's very obvious 
[00:10:30]  When we were kids  She used to go to the ATM  And take an extra $20 out  And then put it away  So there would be  You know, nobody would notice  And then eventually  Behind your dad's back  Yeah  Wow  But then again  Now if your dad is a cheapskate  And the whole family  Kind of loves slash hates him  Why?  More love than hate  Okay, fair enough  But why would you follow in those horrible, frugal footsteps?  Beyond where frugal is necessary  Well, I don't need a giant TV right now  That's all you do is watch TV  Yeah, you watch it obsessively  What's wrong with you?  It's not a giant TV that you need, either 
[00:11:00]  You need a TV  That isn't a TV  You didn't buy a TV  You bought a computer monitor  That is meant to be, like, maybe two feet away from your face  While you're working on a computer  And you've got a 19-inch monitor  I think a lot of people have a 19-inch widescreen computer monitor  Dude, I have a 30-inch monitor on my desk  A Mac one?  An Apple one?  Yeah  30-inch monitor  I got an old TV for my monitor  That's even bigger than that, I think  If we wanted a big TV  That's an investment  That's something you take time 
[00:11:30]  It's not an investment  It's a TV  TVs are not investments  Exactly  TVs are necessities  Yeah, but you want to make sure  You buy the biggest TV possible  You don't even care if you're going to be kicked out  And this is where Sam is dumb  Because you're in the business  And you actually  You really do talk about it  You watch shows for this show  Right  It's a write-off for you  For real  It's a legitimate write-off  If you had a real account  You could write that off  You absolutely could  In essence, you would have only paid half  Of what you're paying for your TV  Oh, fuck, speaking of which  My 65-incher is a fucking write-off 
[00:12:00]  Oh, of course it is  65-incher, Sam  And by the way, Jim  Jim was wondering if you could hang a 65-inch on the wall  Wow  This brand-new 65-inch Samsung  It weighs 38 pounds  That's the one I got  That's way less than a Nagel  You just nailed my TV  That's a great TV  It's a great TV  That's the one I just got  This thing is so fucking thin  65, the Samsung  Is that LCD or is it  LED  LED, baby  Oh, are those better than plasma?  I don't know  Anything's better than that  My plasma's been amazing for five years  It's not bad, but I mean  The stuff they have now is ridiculous 
[00:12:30]  I  They had a TV for me  That I would have to wait until January  I'm like, eh  I think it's 3D ready, right?  3D, LED, LCD, HTT  Mine's LCD  Wow  65-incher  LCD  LCD  That's expensive  LEDs are the good ones  I know, I saw an LED  You don't know the price?  It was like $300  Hold on, Sam  I gotta see how much I paid for the TV  Because I don't even know  God damn  I paid that much?  Yeah, look at that  That's way more than what I paid  Well  Yeah, that's a lot  That's more than I paid  And I paid a lot five years ago  You know what?  I didn't even know it cost that much 
[00:13:00]  Because it's 3D  What difference does it make, right?  It's 3D ready  Easy come, easy go  It's not even that  Three bag of shells  Yeah  I decided a long time ago  Not to fucking pay attention to that stuff  Next I'm buying a boat with three propellers  An LED  Around 19  I paid the phone man $100  Just to take the clicking out of the line  That's right  They had an LED that was like 19 or 22 inches  And that was over $300  Sam  I didn't pay $200 
[00:13:30]  Sam, my computer monitor is bigger  My computer monitor is bigger too  You just watch TV on your computer  You bought a TV that  You bought a TV for kids  Yeah  What do you mean?  Most families, they'll buy a little 19 inch  And put it in some kind of kid's room  And throw Spongebob square pants  Where the kid can sit on the floor  Like two inches away from it  But if I wanted a big, full-size TV  That's something that I would spend time pricing out  Make sure I get the best deal on 
[00:14:00]  It would take several days, possibly weeks  It's not like that anymore  But you're making  You walk in, you look around in the store  And you go, that's a great TV  Don't you bag?  Boom  Boom, you're done, dude  You drink your coffee  You do that after you buy your 32 inch TV  No, 19 inch  No, who starts  When you go to Best Buy  And you see the tiny ones to the left  Who even goes there?  No one goes over there  They're not even in the same area as the TVs  No, no, no  They're in like aisles  Where like VCRs are  Right, right  They're in an aisle 
[00:14:30]  No one has to get it for you  You just pick the box up yourself  And bring it to the register  When they have the displays  We all go to the right  And go, wow, that's a monster TV  Alright, I'll move over a little to the left  A little more to the left  And then you kind of figure out  What you can handle  Then you just hang out in like the 40s  Yeah, exactly  I know my income  Who hangs out in the teens  Except Anthony  Ba-da-ba-ba-ba-da-ba  Wow  Yeah, Anthony likes the smaller TVs  No, that's not what he meant  I already know what I can handle though

[00:21:00]  Or like that you should be driving a Lexus  No one is saying be an asshole  Yeah  But when you spend $180 on a television  A 19-inch television  19-inch  But you could have gotten a pretty fucking good one for $400  That everyone knows  Nah  That's not being smart  That's just being cheap  You pull the trigger  You make the move  Yeah  You have a credit card?  Yeah  Is it maxed out?  No, no, no, no  And what's your problem?  My credit card is paid every month  No  What's the limit?  No  What's the limit on it?  It's American Express  I don't think they're even 
[00:21:30]  Oh, my God  Well, American Express  You kind of got to pay off, sort of  Yeah, but you could  You don't have a Visa or a MasterCard?  I got it  Yeah, I got a Visa  What's the limit on those?  What's the limit?  I don't know  It's high enough to buy a TV for sure  More than $5,000?  Yeah  Then fucking do it  Why didn't you buy a $350 television?  Because I wouldn't have to pay it off  I'll get the bill  Why would you have to pay $350, Ant?  Oh, my God  $350, Ant?  Well, what could you get for  You buy a $350 TV  You immediately pay $200  And then you just pay off $150  Yeah, there you go  Wait a minute  How much time do you have to return this? 
[00:22:00]  There's a lot of different things  That are going on here, too  Because, like, with Best Buy  What you could do is  If you wanted to get a better TV  You could pay it off over time  You don't even pay any interest  Like for 18 months  Right  But that's besides the point  So you could pay it off  In three or four months  So it's not really  Yeah, and then not pay any interest  Yeah, you don't have any interest  Yeah, but it's  Christmas money and you pay it off  So basically, wait  You paid $140, right?  So you could have gotten one from Best Buy  Put down $140  And then say you owed $300  And then you pay, what?  $20 a month  For the next  And it's basically  Like he said, it's cash  And no interest  No interest  I just don't want to have to pay 
[00:22:30]  A monthly bill  Finally, shit, you're enraging  So you'll sit in front of a 19-inch television  You can't be part of the show anymore  Why not?  Because you're enraging  You're dumb  I'm not dumb  You are dumb  And you're smart  This is beyond ridiculous  I can't remember the last time  The staff was so unified on something  I know  Against  Yes  We're not  No, the staff is not unified  Usually you have somebody on your side  This is ridiculous  Well, times are tough right now  It's not tough 
[00:23:00]  You've got an overbearing mother  That'll do anything for you  Yeah  I don't think she would buy me a TV  She'll sneak your money in an envelope  But she'd loan you money to buy a TV  If you didn't want to  Yeah, but then I have to pay her back  What's wrong with paying people back?  You don't have to pay your mom back ever  I do  There were so many  My dad would make sure of it  But your dad doesn't even know  That she sneaks you in the envelope  With the money  No, because then he'd look at the checking accounts  And say, what happened to this money?  She's been taking the extra 20 out  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah  That's what he does now  He's retired  All he does is look at, you know, numbers  But he also is very keen on money making money 
[00:23:30]  And to have your money  You know what you do?  In a TV  You sit your parents down and go  Look, you're getting a little older  If you want me to take care of you  You're going to do the right thing now for me  Buy me a TV  Buy me a TV  You're working a little bit  And money making money  Sure, I understand that  But you have to enjoy your money too  Again, there's a balance  But I bought a nice computer  Several years ago  That's still good  Okay  And that's what  I spent a lot of money on it  Jimmy's absolutely right  But he's not even in this  He's not even in the zone of, like, getting crazy 
[00:24:00]  Right  Right  You could have easily got a 32-inch  And you're still not getting nuts  Yeah, but I saved mine  I don't need a 32-inch  I don't need a giant screen  Did you do this for the radio show?  No  No, that was ingrained in him by his dad  His dad, a guy  Maybe his dad grew up poor  I don't know  But for whatever reason  I just paranoid about being broke  That's that thing  I don't need it  But sometimes you just  You know what  You need a TV that's bigger than 19-inch  You do indulge  You indulge 
[00:24:30]  It's actually part of your job  And if I was going to do something  Just for the show  I just would have kept the Nageltron  No  You knew that we were tired of the Nageltron  Exactly  No  It's a funny name  I would have wanted to just  Keep saying it  You threw the Nageltron away  You get a 19-inch TV going  Wow, I know I'll be on the air  With these guys Monday morning  I would have been on the air anyway  The problem is  In the end  You still have a 19-inch TV  But wait a minute  How long do you have to bring the TV back?  I have no idea  Probably 30 days  Okay, cool  Even after you hook it up  Did you find some kind of deal  Where if you buy a 50-inch  They throw in a 19-inch? 
[00:25:00]  I swear to God  There is no other new TV  How about this?  If Sam doesn't do this  How about this?  He's fired  If you don't  Around Black Friday  You have to return this TV  Because I'm sure you have the receipt in the box  Because you're an OCD ass  That's true  You have to bring it back  And you must buy a better television  Or I'm fired  Or I think that somehow  Human resources should get involved  And he should be fired for racial taunts  How much is your TV?  $180 after tax 
[00:25:30]  After tax?  Why would you pay tax?  Why would you throw that money?  That's not money making money  Why don't you take a Wesley Snipes type sense?  So over a year  Your TV is going to cost you  About $3 and change a day  $3 and change a day  $3 and change a day  A day  That's nothing  Dude I think less than $3 a day  $180 after tax  $365 times 3  I'm thinking  Wait am I wrong?  $3 a week  $3 a week?  That's even better  That's what I meant  I'm sorry  $3 a week 
[00:26:00]  That's great  For a year  You couldn't  You couldn't sacrifice $10 a week  For a year  To get a really nice TV?  Why not do $3?  That's probably why he likes that shitty food  Because it's really cheap  I mean that's why his dad made a meal  When he was a kid  Because that was the cheapest stuff  In the supermarket  And that's what he got used to  You don't need steak  Boy have fish sticks  They're lovely  I'm calling you cheapskate  Or cheap  You're cheapo  Get out of that habit  I'm telling you  It's a bad habit to be in  Nobody likes a cheapskate  But I spend more money at times 
[00:26:30]  When they're  For instance  When I buy chicken  I'll get  Organic vegetable  I'm telling you  Diet chicken  It goes back to the beginning  Of this discussion  Even poor people  Have really nice TVs  Because that's the one thing  But then maybe that's why they're poor  No  No  I would love  They have really nice TVs  And a nice cable package  And then everything else  Whatever  I would love for Sam  To add up  The amount of money  He spent on wrestler pictures  And autographs  This year  I spent money on wrestling stuff  More than $180  So how about you sacrifice 
[00:27:00]  A little of that  And get a nicer TV  For you and Jen  Yeah how about you  Think about your chick  She's fine with it  She's not fine with it  She likes having a deal  She does  She's not that much  Of a cheap screen  This is way past  She's a hot chick  She could  No hot chick  Likes her boyfriend  To get a 19 inch TV  No  That's a great cock  Lousy TV  She was very very worried  For weeks  That we were getting  $200 more a month  In rent  She's very worried  About money too  Just  You got a credit card  Just max this shit out  That's what you do  I'm not going to be  Pretty much what you do  Look at your future 
[00:27:30]  Eventually  You don't have to worry  About that  But in your 20s  It's all about  Maxing out credit cards  Yeah it's just  Being in debt  The government allows that  Being in debt  They allow you to be  Just in debt  You're not an American  You're not a good American  Absolutely  He's a commie creep  You are  I don't like debt  And then I would have  A lot of pressure  I would have to do things  With my career  To make the money  And I would have to  Possibly make sacrifices  To make more money  And that's not the situation  I want to be in  Yeah well you don't want  To be a little  You don't want to be  A little youngster Sam  Something at risk  To propel you forward 
[00:28:00]  True right  You don't always want  To have that safety net  Of I owe nothing  Therefore there's no pressure  Therefore I don't have  To do this or that  Exactly  That's true  You don't  You just fucking  I got a mortgage to pay  We all got mortgages  That's why  Why do you think  We show up with this  Fucking horse shit  Every day  Oh god  Look at that  Tell me about it  399 bucks  For an RCA  42 inch plasma  42 inch plasma  720p  Yeah but everybody knows  Look at the specs on this  It's nice  That's racist  Oh I'm sorry  But still  I mean that's double  I'm not a fan of specs  It's double what I paid 
[00:28:30]  And double the size  Makes sense  Sam  Right  That's  This is so enraging  It makes sense  It really is  I don't know why it is  But it is  That little piece of shit  I paid for half that  And I got half the size  And here's the only thing  About Sam  That does save him  He doesn't bitch  About not having things  Like when you go  To a restaurant with him  If he can't find anything to eat  He really doesn't snivel  And go let's get out of here  He'll just fucking tolerate it  And he  So it's like 
[00:29:00]  He doesn't bitch and moat either  No I'm not a complainer  You are a queer  But he doesn't bitch and moat  I'll say that  I'll take that  But as long as  It's a TV  I know  That's right  It's exactly  It's a TV  You're just paying for it once  It's not like a new bill  Well not if  Not if you want me to get this expensive one  Where I have to pay off this TV for months  Do you have $400 in the bank  Oh yeah  Oh my god  You should have just  Oh my god  Yeah  Oh my god  What are you saving it for  Your vitiligo treatments  In the end  $400 is going to mean shit 
[00:29:30]  Yeah  But in the now it does  It don't mean shit  No  Max out your credit cards  First of all  You don't even take the money out of the bank  You put it on your fucking credit card  Or you get the best buy deal  Where you pay it for 18 months  Without interest  I don't need other bills  I got my phone bill  My cable bill  How many bills you got  My rent  Phone, cable, rent, car  All right  Normal  Yeah I don't have any debt  Normal mid to late 20 shit  Yeah it's normal  But I don't want to have  You know  More than what's normal 
[00:30:00]  Yeah  Yeah more  Right  More crazy  So you sit in front of  An extra $100 over the next year or so  That's crazy  You sit in front of a computer monitor  But maybe eventually  From six feet away  But maybe eventually  We'll upgrade  And then this will fit perfectly  In the bedroom  And we'll be set  No wasted anything  That's too small for the bedroom  Yeah  Because when you watch TV in bed  You're all the way  Yeah  You can't move up  You can't put it in your lap  Right  You're just gonna fucking sit there in bed  With the thing  Have your girl hold the TV  Yeah  I think the Quasar is only like  A 14 inch square screen 
[00:30:30]  Yeah  Oh  Right next door  What happened?  No I'm just looking at Bush  Oh is he  Right next door  Is that live?  I don't know if it's live  Everyone's talking to Bush  We should have a shot at him  Did we even put in for it or no?  I'm thinking we should  We might have a shot at him  We did?  Yeah  Just about everybody at Sirius put in for it  Is he coming?  He's not doing anything here  He's not coming in this building?  No  Saddle up  Ready to go on  Stupid guy  Becoming very likable in my eyes  And I wasn't a big Bush fan  He's the new fucking prince  But that's a dumb publisher right there  To not see that radio is extremely 
[00:31:00]  Of course  Good at book promotions  Even better than TV  He's on everything  That's true  Everything  All right Sam  Enough  Enough with your  Enough with your stupid  Little 19 inch piece of shite  It's the Robert's Vision 5000  And it is the TV of the future  You did it just to get everyone mad at you  Yeah  Why would I do that?  Because you're  I wouldn't spend the 180  Because you're crazy  You were laughing when you bought this  You were laughing  You were going like  Oh are they going to yell at me?  You are a nut job  This is better than the Nageltron I think 
[00:31:30]  It's smaller but it's HD  What was the Nageltron?  How many inches?  32 right?  So why would you drop down 13 inches?  It's either 32 or 36  For the high def  For the high def  Do you realize the Nagel Vision  Plus the Nageltron  Nageltron whatever  Letterboxd is bigger than your TV  The Nageltron is  You can watch just letterboxd movies  Yeah but it doesn't end at 720p  This is how TV goes too  If you have a 32 inch  You don't go backwards  You always get at least another 32 inch  Or higher than that  But the Nageltron is free 
[00:32:00]  I don't think I've ever actually bought a TV  This is the first TV I ever bought  This is the first TV he buys  And it's a 19  I get a hand-me-down  Oh god  A hand-me-down  Because I had that Quasar forever  Dude  I had my girlfriend's old TV  Quasar  You have a credit card  He has a credit card with no debt on it  You just do the right thing  And you pop that credit card down  And you get yourself a nice TV  I'm not in the business  I pay off my credit on time every month  Yeah they don't like that  They don't like that  You need to accrue some type of 
[00:32:30]  Yeah you should have some debt  Yeah they like debt  Forget that  I'm not paying pay off the debt  That's the only way to build your credit  Is to have debt  Right  It helps your credit score in the end  They don't like when you pay it off right away  You have some of mine  Do you have great credit there?  Well I have very good credit  But I also have a lot of debt  Everyone's got some debt  I still know  I mean  You need that debt  I got car payments  I got rent  The car's in my name  How much is your car payment?  I'm not sure  It's like  200 a month  Maybe a little more  I know they don't pay around here  But Jesus  You got a credit card 
[00:33:00]  With no debt on it  I dreamed of that  When I was your age  It's easy to accomplish  Just don't spend out of your means  I fucking maxed mine out  That's a bad idea  I had no choice  Yes you did  You could have got a smaller  You said you got a big TV  Right  I was very happy with the big TV  But you were very unhappy  With your debt  Not really  Well I would be  I figured I was just  Going to live my life  As a poor guy  I would feel like  There was something  In the end I guess  I lucked out  If I had debt  I would feel like  There was something  On my back all the time  Oh  Oh you're dead 
[00:33:30]  Gay man  Exactly  Your dead fucks you up  Yeah he really did  When you're going to  Start growing the handlebar mustache  I'm not going to  I'm not going to  Grow a mustache  I enjoy my money  But I don't overspend  His hair though  Is the equivalent  Of his father's mustache  Yes  Do you understand that  Like he won't get the mustache  But he's got the weird hair thing  So  Let me go with this  Yeah  You've been growing your hair  For how long now  When was that contest  Probably three years  You know how much money  You've saved on  On haircuts  I know  And dumb ones 
[00:34:00]  Let's say just a stupid  Lemon tree haircut  How much is that  Like 15 bucks  Something like that  Yeah probably  I know  And when were you getting  Your haircut every other month  Maybe  Six haircuts a year  Yeah  Call it 20 bucks a pop  Yeah  Save money  You know how much money  You've saved  Not getting your hair cut  That you could put  To your TV  No you put it towards  If you need it  Or you save it  Yes you need it  A rainy day  You know you could run this place  The way you think  Yeah really  Holy shit  But I got 
[00:34:30]  When the iPhone came out  I got the iPhone  The first day  You know  I spent money that way  So why didn't you get  I think you spent more money  On your iPhone  Than your 19 inch TV  Well yeah for sure  No wonder you like  Mick Foley so much  You two chiselers  Can you sit down  He's another cheapo  But yeah but now  He can leave the WWE  When Vince McMahon  Is screaming in his headset  And not have to worry  About feeding his family  No he didn't want to leave  That's how horrible  That gig was  Exactly  You think he wanted  To leave the WWE  To wrestle in some league  No one knows about  At this point  Stop worrying about  Feeding your family 
[00:35:00]  It's just you and your chick  Isn't that the Great Depression  We are in a recession though  It's like Travis said  It's enraging for everybody  Enjoy your 19 inch TV  We're sorry  The company that he bought  Yeah we're sorry  We try to like  Wake you up a little bit  Enjoy your 19 inch TV  Well you all enjoy your debt  I got a  I almost have no debt  Well you guys make money now  I got a 65 inch TV  65 inch  My TV  What is that like  Is that from The Office  Yeah it's when 
[00:35:30]  Michael Scott had his  In short  It's actually a lot bigger  Than it seems  Look at this  I have a full size bed  Yeah but wait  So you see his big  His big centerpiece TV  I finally broke down  And bought myself  A plasma TV  Check it out  I actually found this  On the wall  Myself  That's good  I want to show you something  A lot of people in the room  You need more space  Voila  He pushes it two inches 
[00:36:00]  Sometimes  I will just  Stand here  And watch television  For hours  That's your TV  They made a joke  About this  On The Office  That's your TV  On The Office  Like three years ago  I think my TV  The screen's bigger  Because he's got the speakers  On the thing  My speakers are under it  So  More screen  Sorry we try to wake you up  Enjoy your TV  Yeah well  I'm confident in my choice  That was really funny  When they pan over  And it's the smallest  Little TV  Hanging on the wall  I finally broke down 
[00:36:30]  That's Sam's TV  My TV's black  It couldn't be my TV  Oh yeah  Like you  Exactly  Great  Let's take a break  Yeah I've had it  I'm depressed  I've had it with you  And your stupid little TV  There's nothing wrong with it  It's 720p  PlayStation hooked up  Blu-ray  PlayStation  PlayStation 3  How do you see anything  It's Blu-ray  It's HD  It's Blu-ray 
[00:37:00]  Very detailed  You're playing video games on it  No I haven't yet  But I will  Which costs more than his TV  By the way  The PlayStation  Oh yes  Double  Almost  That might be the cheapest thing  In your house  The TV  The TV  The TV  Yeah  Yeah  Maybe  I mean a lot of  Hand-me-downs in the house  Except for you  Plus all the furniture  You're the cheapest thing  In your house  Fuck  All the furniture is from Target  So half of it broke in the move  But like that's why  That's why the TV stand  Has no glass in front of it  Particle board fucking furniture  Yeah Target is a piece of shite  My girlfriend had a  I bought her a love seat 
[00:37:30]  Or whatever  A futon from Target  And her fat friend sat on it  And broke it  Really  Yeah we had to send it back  My desk literally  The movers picked it up  And it fell to pieces  And when I say movers  I mean the two guys with a van  That we gave a hundred bucks to  Yeah yeah  A hundred bucks  Why'd you just give them a TV  Why didn't you move your shit yourself  And then put the hundred dollars  Toward a bigger TV  Because moving  Is a pain in the ass  It costs you a hundred dollars to move  Yeah  What they just drag your shit  Behind the fucking ropes 
[00:38:00]  Yeah what the fuck  Who charges a hundred dollars to move  I graduated with the kid  I even went to the same high school  As me  Him and the landlord  Helped you move to a new place  Yeah  Landlord  Alright  There's your update  The picture's on Not Sam  On Twitter  That's right  And there's the Nagotron  Rest in peace  The mover just put it in  Was the Nagotron still working?  Oh yeah  It looks like a table  You should have brought it  To your new place  No I didn't want it  Put the 19 inch  In the fucking bedroom  I wouldn't have bought the 19 inch  If the Nagotron was there 
[00:38:30]  No way  No  I'm officially off the hook  You're way worse than I ever  I'm mad at you  The Nagotron doesn't look  That hard to handle  It's extremely heavy  I know  I know how tubes are  Look at the back of that thing  That thing is like fucking  I think mine was bigger  My tube was bigger  It was huge  Like three feet wide  You get a TV that's like  Three feet deep  That's antiquated  That's why it's out of here mister  It leaves big like burn marks  On the wall  Where it was sitting 
[00:39:00]  Like a nuclear blast  Went off in your living room  Yeah definitely  Is it amazing  How fast flat screens  Kick the shit out of fucking  Oh yeah  I remember having the  A few years ago  The computer monitor  That went all the way to the wall  Yeah yeah  I pick up the Roberts vision  With one hand  Easy  Of course  It's a fucking 19 inch  It could have been made of lead  It would still be light  Yeah  Small  You know what I don't understand  He's so frugal  With his money for the TV  But he dropped $100 on movers  Because moving's a pain in the ass 
[00:39:30]  Yeah yeah  He's a spoiled kid  But  Bobby did everything for him  This kid doesn't know  How to work like a hard dog  You don't think he can drive a U-Haul  Well  Oh my god  Oh actually  I have driven a U-Haul  I hope he can in Oklahoma  I've had to move myself twice  The last two times I moved  I moved myself  What was used to move your stuff?  18 trips  A van  A little van?  Yeah just like a van  One trip?  Three trips  Three trips  Crazy  Couch  Box spring  Of course there's a couch  Yeah would you? 
[00:40:00]  I've had to move myself  Twice before  So the third time  If you moved by yourself this time  You could have bought a better TV  No no no  But then I would have to move myself  What does Bobby think of the 19 inch TV?  She hasn't seen it yet  She's going to think it's pretty cool though  It's flat screen  No she's not  I don't think so  She'll probably be really fed up with me  Because she'll see the things that bother her  About my dad coming out in me  Yeah  Of course  Maybe she'll get me a TV  That she hates in your dad by the way  Yeah yeah  Not to bother  That she hates in him  Despised 
[00:40:30]  He's gotten better with age  So I think she hated those things  But maybe she'll get so fed up  She'll just buy me a TV  Well now you have one  So she's not gonna  You should have went to her beforehand  Right  You should have hinted that  God there's no way to get it through his head  That would have been a great Christmas gift  Yeah say another Christmas gift  How about you bring the fucking Eric TV  Nageltron  Whatever the fuck is called  The shit box  And then you have them buy you one for Christmas  You put in 190  And so you want them to put in 300  As an early Christmas gift  Or 200  And then you buy one on Black Friday 
[00:41:00]  So you get a great fucking TV  You watch the shit Nageltron for a week  I'm sure your mom buys nice gifts for you every Christmas  Oh yes yes  So that's your Christmas gift  A nice TV  I didn't want the Nageltron in my apartment  Why?  I'm done with it  I'm tired of seeing it  Well they would have  And then we would have had to move it  When we got the new TV  So?  I didn't want to touch it again  You throw it out by the curb  Somebody like you  Comes by and picks it up  And fucking uses it  A younger Sam  A younger Sam comes by  You see how tiny your TV is 
[00:41:30]  Yeah I see  I see every picture  Your table box is longer than your TV  Are people starting to comment on that picture by the way?  Many people commented  Are there comments?  Yes  A lot of people commented  Yeah everyone's just mad  Your mom would have put in money for your TV  You could have got an amazing deal on Black Friday  Yeah  Maybe I still will move that TV to the bedroom  Maybe  But I don't know if I'll do it as soon as Black Friday  Every Friday is Black Friday for Sam by the way  Because of the  Because you're black  Oh that's right  Yeah but black people know how to buy a TV 
[00:42:00]  Oh god do they?  But they  Wow  Some  The stereotype of black people is they live outside of their means  Everybody does  I don't  Yet  Is that a stereotype?  I'm not  Huh?  That's right  I didn't know that was a stereotype  Uh huh  Your credit line  You could have had a little debt  Maybe three, four hundred dollar debt on your credit card  And you would have had a nice TV  I don't like  And you would have paid off that debt within months  I don't like that  Breeze  I'm so fucking pissed off  I'm really annoyed with you  Why?  Oh it's stupid 
[00:42:30]  The Opie and Anthony show  On the virus  Virus  Sirius XM  I must admit  I can't explain  Any of these thoughts racing through my brain  It's true  Baby I'm calling for you  Da da da da  Da da da da  Da da da da  Da da da da  Good morning 
[00:43:00]  It was a fine day for football yesterday, huh?  Yes  Unless your team lost  Well  Fucking Jimmy's Cowboys beat the Giants  They did do well  Beat them bad 
[00:43:30]  33 to 20  The Giants probably took them lightly  And when you're on a five game winning streak  You're going to lose eventually  I thought they had somehow switched uniforms  They don't get it  Oh no  Really?  Oh shit  That's loud  And the lights went out too  Which was a little creepy  Yes  Transformer blew up  And at first they decided  Let's just play with the lights kind of going off  Did you notice it on TV?  It was weird looking  Yeah  A little dark  A little shadowy  And then they  What?  They delayed the game a little bit 
[00:44:00]  Yeah  And then they got the power on  It went off again  Any explanation why the power went out  In a billion dollar stadium?  Brands are a billion dollar stadium?  It wasn't a stadium  It was a transformer  At a substation  That supplies part of the power  To the  Lucky Jets  I call them  But the Browns  Seem to be a better team  Than their record shows  Yeah  Yeah I think so  I think the Browns  Nothing but respect for the Browns  Man  They got a good program up there  I don't like the Browns  Why?  Oh  I just don't like  You know  You like the Browns better than the Blakes 
[00:44:30]  Is there an NFL team called the Blacks?  Yeah the Raiders  Oh damn  No you didn't  That was stupid  Yeah the Jets beat the Browns 26-20  With 16 seconds left in overtime  That game was supposed to end in overtime  I don't know why the NFL  Allows that by the way  Games to end in a tie  That's the dumbest thing  They only play 16 games  Shouldn't be a tie in football 
[00:45:00]  There shouldn't be a tie in any sport  But what  People's attention can't handle  Their attention spans  Yeah  There's a million ties in hockey now  Just play these games out  And the funniest thing is  There's no ties in baseball  Which can go on forever  Without a tie  Right  Just nine innings can take forever  Right  And then you get into extra innings  That could take unbelievable forever  And baseball is the only sport  That doesn't have a clock  Yeah yeah  No clock  Whatever  And plus they play 
[00:45:30]  I don't know what time  They play 162 games  So who cares if one of the games  Ends in a tie  It doesn't matter  But in football  You only have 16 games  And you're allowing some of these games  To end in a tie  Possibly  That's so dumb  It really is  Sports is so stupid  There's a lot of stupid rules in sports though  And hockey  They battle it out  A sport I used to follow  Before the Islanders  Completely fell apart  And became the worst team in hockey  You know  That's enraging  When you're sitting there  You know  At a game  And it ends in a tie  Yeah  What does it matter  If it goes another half hour 
[00:46:00]  Who cares  I was talking to Derek about hockey  I absolutely hate  That you get a point  If you go to overtime  Right  You know  Like  Yeah I don't like that  I don't like that either  Because you get  You get two points if you win  You get one point  Yeah yeah  You each get one point  If you go to overtime  But  He's just trying to figure out  Knockin' the fuckin' puck  The length of the ice  But you force the goalie to come out though  And play the puck  Oh man  And he has to move forward  Come on  Who wouldn't want to see this  It's a lot better than a shootout  I think so  They both meet at center ice  And whoever gets the fuckin' puck 
[00:46:30]  Wins pretty much  Yeah  You can just go shootin' in an open net  With two goalies at center ice  Ah shit  That's good  So the Jets and the Browns  Almost ended in a tie  And then Holmes there  Scored with 16 seconds left  Yeah  Jets are doing alright  But man  The Pats are looking good  And the Jets have  We don't have a kicker  Basically at this point  So  No shit  Wow  Yeah folk  That guy blows monkey ass  Huh  Yeah he sure does  Shit  What did he miss?  He missed a 20  I forgot how many yards 
[00:47:00]  24 yarder  He missed I think  Three field goals yesterday  And he missed the one  That was in overtime  Oh yeah  Yeah  Which would have been the win  Right there  And I was taking on Cleveland  Yesterday on Twitter  And I was  I was  I was tweeting  Folk  Folk  Folk  Knowing that he sucks  But people didn't  You know  They didn't understand  What I was doing  And then finally  He comes in  For the winning field goal  In overtime  And of course  He fucked  And he missed it  By a mile  Wait  Cleveland missed a field goal?  The Jets  Oh Jets 
[00:47:30]  Yeah  Well the guy missed three  In overtime  Would have just been  The end of the game  Right there  When the Jets kicker  His folk  And he missed  He missed three yesterday  Oh wait  I hate kickers that miss  I know  Kick the ball  Fuck  How hard is that to do?  It's not  It's not  It's all you have to do  It's all you have to focus on  Nothing makes someone angrier  Than when a kicker  Is missing a lot  Yeah  And that's why kickers  Stay until they're like 50 too  Yeah  There's so many old kickers  Because all they're using  Is their foot  Yeah  I understand what 
[00:48:00]  No I know  You didn't need to explain that  I was like why?  And kickers become  Hold on  Trav this is  Why?  You mean they're not  Taking the same hits  As a linebacker?  Go  No you're right though  Yeah so  So my Jets  They're my Jets  Thanks Aunt Travis  They only use their foot  They don't hurt  We got it  My Jets are 7-2  Without a kicker  We need to get a kicker  I wouldn't be surprised  If they get rid of folk  Today  Dude he should be  Fucking killed  For sucking  Yeah because that game  Should have never went  Into overtime  If he was just  Doing his job  Were you mad 
[00:48:30]  When he missed?  Of course  You just watch it  Go a mile off  What is he  What is he looking at?  You piece of shit  He missed 3  3  He's not a kicker  I think it was 3  I know it was a  46 yarder in OT  I know there was  A 20 something yarder  And I believe  There was a third one  In there somewhere  How did the Jets win?  Did he eventually hit one?  No  A touchdown  No  Yeah it was Holmes  With 16 seconds left  Basically a broken play 
[00:49:00]  And we kind of lucked out  To be completely honest with you  I hate to say it  It could be 5-4  I gotta say it  That was a complete luck out  Yeah we just  That and last week  Against Detroit  That's what makes great teams  You luck out a few times  We've won two games in a row  On the road in overtime  Has never been done before  In the NFL  That's because most teams  Are good enough  Just to win outright on the road  Yeah  It's not a good thing  I know  And the Browns have  That Hillis guy  Peyton Hillis 
[00:49:30]  Holy shit  Is that guy  A fucking animal  A white running back  Who's an animal  There's not many of them  In the league  He's a fucking animal  White  Whitey making a comeback  I don't know  There's not many  White running backs  What do they call him  The great white buffalo  Or something like that  He's pretty amazing  To watch  Hillis  Yeah  How many great running backs  Are there in the league  Right now  Were there any  Famous ones 
[00:50:00]  Yeah  Like from the past  Oh you got  What's his name there  Riggins  Oh wow  Riggins  You gotta go back to Riggins  With his afro  His big afro hair  Has there been a great  White running back  Since Riggins  Larry Zonka  Was Larry  Kazonka  I think Larry Kazonka  Was way before  Riggins  Oh yeah  Yeah  How do you say his name  Kazonka  Larry Zonka  Kazonka  They put a C in there  Just to fuck you up  Larry Zonka  Larry the Tsar Zonka  Yeah 
[00:50:30]  What about Emerson Boozer  Emerson Boozer  Was as black as knife  You couldn't be blacker  Than Emerson Boozer  Emerson Boozer  Why was he booing her  What'd she do wrong  No it's Boozer  Maybe she was doing  Something wrong  Didn't he own like a sports bar  Or a regular bar  In Huntington Station  After his time  Did he  I just remember  I think that was the rumor  I remember seeing him  Play at Shea Stadium  Yeah  At Shea  When fucking the Jets  Played at Shea  You know  And we are talking  To the rest of the country  So we really should  Talk about that 
[00:51:00]  Hail Mary yesterday  Holy shit  Yeah that was a  Big fucking  Can I see that  Because Patrice tweeted it  Holy shit  It's the best play of the year  Let me see it  Now the guy bats it down  And I was yelling  At Anthony  This morning  When we were looking  At the play again  I'm like  Why didn't he catch it  But then again  He was too close  To the goal line  Because that could  Have been a bad scene  Yeah you didn't want  To catch it  But he bats it down  With two hands  Trying to bat it  Straight down  And right into  The guy's hands  It's one of the  Most amazing plays  Ever  He should have just  Whacked the thing  Behind him  Like past the end zone 
[00:51:30]  Yeah but you know  He fucked that up  Real bad  Oh  Can you blame that guy though  I think it's just  One of those  Looked like volleyball  It looked like he was  Spiking the ball  And he spiked it  Right into the guy's  Fucking lap  Hail Mary  We have to  Fucking do commercials  We gotta wait  For the Lexus  Commercial to play  Well thank god  We learned about  Alexis  Alexis  Your video  Is coming in  I told you to go back  He did tell you  Danny  He told you  Yeah Danny  He did tell you  He told you  Yeah I told you  Go back  He did tell you 
[00:52:00]  Twice  He told you  He told you  He did  He's not good at the end  Exactly  I don't like your  Three inch apart  Face hairs either  There's a big space  In between each face hair  And it's bugging me  I should probably  Look in a mirror  Here's the play  For Jimmy  Look at this  Fucking Hail Mary  Whoa  That's a pass  Six of yards  Just about right  Holy shit  Wait how 
[00:52:30]  Holy shit  That was the end  Good for the Jags  Three seconds left  That was amazing  Good for the Jaguars  At home too man  Tied with three seconds left  Watch the replay Jimmy  Because it's hard to see  Three seconds  He's fucking  You said it  Mike Sims Walker  Is going to go  Watch the guy  Trying to just bat it down  Right into the hands 
[00:53:00]  Oh my god  That guy should have  Caught it though  Well I don't know  Because he's right  On the goal line  He could not have  Knocked that  Right into his hand  Any better  That is like  That's a one in a million  Dude he should have  Caught that fucking  Oh  It's right at the goal line  Though  And it was tied  It was tied  But he didn't have to  Whack it right  Into the guy's  Fucking arms  He had to pick him up  And help him  I'm sure that  He didn't want to  Do that Anthony 
[00:53:30]  Do you think he was  Afraid of  Too close to the goal line  To catch the ball  But why  If he caught it  And got tackled  Would that have been  Anything or no  No no no  It's an interception  If he catches it  In the end zone  And gets tackled  Isn't that a safety  No I think  That's why  Quarterback  Is that  No  Is that  If you intercept  In the end zone  And get tackled  Is that a safety  I believe so  I don't think it is  I should know that  But I'm pretty sure it is  No  I don't think it is  No  It's a touch  People are saying  It's a touchback 
[00:54:00]  It's a touchback  Because it gets tackled  Yes  Because I think  If  Or do you have to  Take a knee  For a touchback  I think maybe  If your offense  Can get a safety  On it  But can your defense  And now I'm reading  Holy shit  Sports dummy show  I should know  But wait  Can your defense  Get a  Wow now I'm really confused  I don't know  I always thought  That would be two  If you're tackling  Because that would  Determine you from  Intercepting in the end zone  And you gotta  Intercept in the end zone  If two guys  Are going up for the ball  And you just  Grab it and fall down  That's not a safety 
[00:54:30]  The phone's just  Pull up  You'd never be  Penalized for that  We're now gonna be  Called dummies  About a hundred times  I'm the football key  Outside of the end zone  And then in the end zone  For it to be a safety  Oh you know what  So wait  Outside the end zone  And then go into the end zone  Wait okay  That's what I'm saying there  So then it would have been  A touchback  No he was gonna be  Right on  He was pretty much  On the goal line  Maybe around the  One yard line  So then if he catches it  And then he's knocked  Back in the end zone  What about the forward progress  He might not have known  Exactly where he was  I think he was in the end zone  Can we get the commissioner 
[00:55:00]  Of the NFL on  I have a question  I've been texting him  The whole time  He's fucking  He's sending me cock pictures  Maybe he didn't know  Exactly where he was  Well as a defenseman  Your job is to  Knock the ball away  Alright we gotta coach  Gary in Iowa  Used to coach football  You teach them  To knock that play down  I get that  But would that be  A safety if he caught it  If he caught it  In the end zone  No it'd just be  It'd be a touchback  Alright what if he caught it  On the one yard line  And got knocked back  Into the end zone  Yeah  Or fell back in  You know usually 
[00:55:30]  It's kind of  That'd be a difficult  You don't know either  If he gets knocked  But there's momentum  Going backwards  He's a coach  And doesn't even know  You think  That's good  Wait let me ask you a question  You coached football  See at least our  We have an excuse  We never coached football  Exactly  We're gay  So wait what  Sir  What  First of all  What down was that  Because it was  Three seconds on the clock  What down was that  That was it  That was the last play  No no no  How many downs are there  But why would you  So you said you teach them  To knock it away  Why would you teach them  To knock it away  If like let's just say 
[00:56:00]  That ball got knocked away  And stopped the clock  With one second  No no no  There was no time left  That was it  That was it  No no but he's saying  He teaches the players  To knock that ball away  But I'm saying  Why would you teach them  Why  Well because the odds  Are in your favor there  That you're going to go up  And spike it to the ground  If you go up  And try and catch it  There's more of a chance  Of the ball popping up  In the air  Oh okay  And the receiver grabbing it  Plus the field position  Is there  Or whatever  Yeah  So what's the answer  Derek is saying  It's a touchback  Two points  Not zero points  Safety is two points 
[00:56:30]  So if you  But if you  Let's just say  You catch it  On the one yard line  And fall back  Into the end zone  We should just talk  About football all day  This would be  The best sports talk show ever  I would listen to this  Every day  I'm reading this  Oh my god  Like OMG  Holy shit  I don't know  But those fuckers  Don't know either  I betcha  Hey dog  I betcha  They don't even know  We should have  You know what dog  Get on the phone dog  Who's that dumb Francesa  Touchback  So then  He should have  Caught it obviously 
[00:57:00]  Why wouldn't you  Catch that  No time on the clock  Well cause like  The coach on the phone  Said you're taught  To knock that play  He's not a coach  He didn't even know  Well like the fed coach  Says you're taught  To knock that play  Yeah  Yeah  Pedarrest  That situation  That happened  That is one in a million  Couldn't wait for  After practice  For shower time  Huh Gary  Would you buy  The kids pizza  You smell those  Jock straps  To see who was  Working hard  How many pool parties  Did you have sir  We're doing a  Sleepover at my house  All the parents  Trust me  Alright 
[00:57:30]  Much out boys  Alright Gary  Thank you  You do that  You do that  This guy  Alright Jeff  In North Carolina  Jeff  Hey I thought  I was listening  To the view  Here for a minute  Alright then  What's the call  What's the call  On that sir  If you catch it  In the end zone  It is a touchback  Right  You're tackled  You can slide down  It's considered  A touchback  However  If you catch it  In the playing field  And then you carry  Yourself into the end zone  And are tackled  It is a safety 
[00:58:00]  Okay so that was  The right thing  What about the  Forward progress thing  That's something  That will come down  To a review  He might have  Falling backwards  When he caught it  You never know  But see he was  Moving forward  So then he should  Have caught the ball  There was no way  He was going to  Fall backwards  At that point  Exactly  Correct  So he fucked up  Pretty much  Right  That's my opinion  That's your opinion  I like your opinion  It matches my opinion  Now  Huh  Love Jimmy and Raleigh  Man he was great  Oh thank you man  It was a great club  The good nights in Raleigh 
[00:58:30]  Was fantastic  Raleigh  Thank you  Awesome  Are we done with this  Yeah  Finally we got an answer  This guy thinks  He knows the answer  Rich in Florida  Rich  Good morning  Alright Rich  Get to it  Enough of that shit  Exactly  What do you got  Alright so if the defender  Catches the ball  You see how distracting  That is  It's from 1997  Let it go  I know  We do 3 hours  And 40 minutes of radio  Let's get to the point  Happy birthday Jimmy  Thank you  Man you just wasted  Another 10 seconds  Of course he did  That time  So if the defender 
[00:59:00]  Catches the ball  Say at the 2 yard line  And he is being  Pushed back  Into the end zone  It would be a touchback  Right  However if the defender  Catches the ball  Makes a movement  Towards the end zone  On his own  And then gets tackled  In the end zone  That would most likely  Be a safety  Yeah that's what  The guy before  Before you just said  But that  So a lot of  A lot of people  Say  He was right  To swap the  B-b-b-b-b-ball  Happy birthday 
[00:59:30]  Hail Mary  Right we know  Can I take one more  Because it's an official  Because I still don't know  What the fuck  He didn't catch the ball  He should have  Caught the ball  Gregory  We got it  Hey why didn't he  Molest the children  And the ball  Uncle Paul  That's it  Why did he play  With his balls  That's it  Again yeah  The ball  Again  Guys  Why didn't he  Catch the  Ba-da-ba-ba-da  Ball  How many things 
[01:00:00]  You're gonna do sir  You got it  That's long gone  Oh it's fucking endless  This guy and his  Catchphrases  We know  So do you think  Turd  Turd  In person  In person  All right we got an official  Anthony  We don't have an official  Are you really an official  Yes I am  New Jersey official  Listen  All right go ahead  Give us the scoop  Bubby what happened  Tell us quick  Wait what is a New Jersey official  What do you  I officiate high school 
[01:00:30]  All right good enough  I'll accept that  If you catch the ball  Inside the two yard line  Three yard line  Whatever  And your momentum  Carries you into the end zone  It's a touchback  You have to by rule  Go into the end zone  Bring the ball back out  And then go back in  And get tackled  In the end zone  To be a safety  So basically  If you carry the ball  Into the end zone  And you fall down  In the end zone  We're giving you a touchback  If you run in the end zone  Run around in the end zone 
[01:01:00]  Go out to the one  And circle back in  Then you're screwed  Wait a minute  Hold on  Why is everyone laughing at us  This is kind of complicated  But no no  A lot of times  It's the most complicated rules  There's two complicated rules  In football  Momentum and force  Are both at the goal line  But wait sir  Let me ask you a question  If you are a quarterback  And gets his hike  The b-b-b-ball  And then he goes back  And is tackled in the end zone  He hasn't come in and out  Of the end zone  It's still a safety  No no no  That's a safety  There's no momentum there  He carries  Just say he catches the ball  On the four yard line 
[01:01:30]  His momentum carries him  Into the end zone  He stays in the end zone  It's a touchback  He runs out to the one  Then circles back into the end zone  Alright I got it  Okay  I kind of got it  Alright so you saw the play  Yesterday Anthony  Right he should have caught it  I would have gave him a touchback  Alright that's what I'm thinking  But is that the difference  Fucked up in the end  The quarterback  There's no momentum issue  With the quarterback  Right  Who put the ball  In the end zone  If you put the ball  In your own end zone  It's a safety  If you catch the ball  Then bring the ball  Oh okay  It's a little complicated  It is complicated  Alright 
[01:02:00]  So it's very complicated  So the guy  The guy would have been  Way better off  Just catching the fucking ball  Catch the ball  Lay down on the end zone  And it's a touchback  Even if he  Even if he caught it  On the one yard line  And then got knocked back  In the end zone  I got it now  Put the ball  On the one yard line  Game's over  I got it  He should have  Fucking caught that thing  No way  Alright brother  Thank you so much Anthony  Guys you rock  Alright  I like that explanation  So what's a safety  Alright 
[01:02:30]  I like the people  That get so angry with us  They don't even know  About sports  And they're talking about  Shut up  I'm nowhere near an expert  I love watching sports  Yeah  And I do the best I can  But this  Yeah he should have  Caught that  Yeah he was coming  I think in that moment  You're not 100% sure  And whatever  Maybe he didn't want  To get hit  Wow but he batted  Right in the guys  It's very scary  Does that have anything  Oh no because overtime  Would have started  Watched a bunch of guys  Running after him  If he caught that ball 
[01:03:00]  He was fucking plastered  Where was he going to go  Maybe he didn't want  To catch it and fumble  Anyone know if the Pats  Looked good last night  I couldn't stay up for that  Great  Yeah Tom Brady quit  33-26  How did Tom  B-b-b-b-brady do  33-26  39-26  Oh  Yeah Tom Brady  Had like three touchdowns  He looked very good  It's rock star haircut  Justin Bieber  What a guy  Not even a haircut  He's growing his fucking hair out  Justin who  They're having problems  With that up there  They're not happy  That Brady's  Growing his hair out  Did he say Bieber  Bieber 
[01:03:30]  Bieber  Happy birthday  Justin Bieber  Happy b-b-b-birthday  B-b-bab-boys  And the Bills  fucked it up  They won  Their first game  Of the season  Oh now  It's like  Who cares  Now you're just  A shitty team  I know man  It could have been  The shittiest  If I'm living in  Buffalo  At this point  You want  0-16  Why not  Yep  They beat the Lions.  They had to win one.  I think that's about it, right? 
[01:04:00]  Asshats.  Brett Favarar.  Brett Favarar.  Lost to the Bears.  They only have three wins, right, Minnesota?  Three and six.  They stink on ice.  They're going to fire their coach this week, most likely.  They're in a bad place.  And Brett Favarar saying he's not coming back next year.  No, who cares?  He already announced it.  He started that shit already.  He started that shit already.  Enough of him.  He told NFL Network last week he's not coming back next year.  Enough of him with his fucking retirement.  He said two things.  The Vikings are on a Super Bowl team this year, and he's not coming back next year. 
[01:04:30]  What a girl.  Shut up.  No one gives a fuck.  So he started that shit already.  You little dick fuck.  Exactly.  Take your fucking awful short cock helmet and go home.  That's from all those years from the ball being pounded into it.  It's short cock helmet.  Exactly.  Take your fucking rock-em-sock-em robot cock helmet and fucking hit the bricks.  It is just a weird fucking World War I doughboy helmet.  His cock looks like it's shrugging.  Nobody fucking cares.  No one gives a turkey.  Excuse my French.  You guys remember about five minutes ago we had the high school official on? 
[01:05:00]  Of course.  Well, this guy is saying that high school rules are different than NFL rules.  Oh, great.  I can't believe this.  Oh, God.  This is way better than listening to two guys that know what the fuck they're talking about.  Hey, I dog.  I like it this way way better.  Hey, friend, hey, your facade is not going to hurt.  Then I can't have to shut up.  An hour on that fucking nonsense.  You know what I was reading over the weekend?  That the Yankees have a chance to get rid of those two fucking schmucks and bring in real announcers.  Really?  Contracts up. 
[01:05:30]  You know what?  John Sterling and Susan Wallman could be done.  I'm up in the air on Sterling.  I like him except for his home run fucking calls.  I love him except for that.  They're not getting rid of Sterling.  So maybe they tell him, look, we'll sign again, but get rid of that horseshit home run call.  And we'll all be happy.  They should fucking mace him if he does that.  All right.  Let's go to Don in Ohio.  Don.  Don.  Is Don on the phone?  Real quick here because I know you only got one.  Happy birthday, Don.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fungus.  Just one thing real quick on the NFL rule on the momentum. 
[01:06:00]  If you intercept the ball at like two or three and your momentum takes you in the end zone  and you're tackled in there, the ball is spotted at the three.  It's not a touchback.  They spot it where you first caught the ball as long as you don't advance it back out of the end zone.  Oh, now I completely understand.  In high school, it would be a touchback, but in the NFL, it's spotted where you first caught the ball.  So once again, the guy should have fucking caught the ball.  Yeah.  Regardless, yeah, whether he catches the one or whatever or catches the end zone. 
[01:06:30]  All right.  It doesn't matter where it's spotted.  The clock runs out.  All right.  So the guy should have caught it.  Thank you.  It's still a great win for the Jaguars.  Of course.  Congrats.  Of course it is.  Hey, wrapping up the little sports thing we did.  We're sitting here watching the news before the show today.  And language on TV is driving me insane at this point.  Oh, language.  It's driving me insane.  And now you've got a sports guy here in New York. 
[01:07:00]  Well, sports guy.  Well, just play it.  Listen to what this guy just did.  A Rangers hockey game yesterday was a pretty amazing game.  Lots of fights and stuff.  A couple of brawls.  And this guy was doing the highlights for the Rangers game.  And listen to what he says.  Earlier in the day at the Garden, a wild one between the Rangers and the Oilers.  Sean Avery drops the gloves and goes at it with Lattice Love Schmid.  And he connects with a wild haymaker as Avery starts heading for the box. 
[01:07:30]  All heck break loose.  And the team's both start growing.  He says all heck breaks loose.  All heck breaks loose.  What is wrong with these people?  They're faggots.  They can't say hell on the news.  They're just pussies, dude.  But if you say heck, everyone knows you mean hell.  So you also mean hell.  So what does it change?  They just, dude, they're all fucking terrified of losing their jobs.  A rose by any other name.  A rose by any other name.  That's right. 
[01:08:00]  It would still poke your hiney if you put it in there.  Yeah.  I mean, it's like N-word.  You're a nerd if you say that.  Of course you are.  They used to say racial epithet on the news.  And now they just say, he called him the N-word.  And everybody knows what it means.  And the word flashes in your head.  And it's not like they're not saying the word.  They might as well just be saying the word.  And that becomes the word now.  You're not changing how people think by changing the words.  The new word becomes the old word.  If you walk up to a black guy and go, hey, N-word, you're going to get your ass kicked. 
[01:08:30]  Of course.  Because it's the same thing.  But the dopey news thing, N-word is acceptable.  But you're still doing the exact same thing as saying the actual word.  And they only use it in news.  They don't, like, it's not acceptable to go like, oh, that guy's an N-word.  Like, people would be like, what?  If somebody said that on TV, they would be fired, have to apologize.  Not even saying the word.  Right.  Go with the midget thing.  Midget.  The little things don't like being called midgets, right? 
[01:09:00]  No, little people.  So they want to be called little people.  But now if you call someone a little person, oh, I saw that little person, that means midget.  You haven't changed anyone's mind.  You're thinking midget when you hear that.  You're thinking midget.  But now midget is actually little person.  Yeah.  What are you changing?  Nothing.  And then a few years go by and people go, oh, wow, you can't call him a little person.  That's really not nice.  Semantics, as they say.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It doesn't change anything in the end. 
[01:09:30]  And this guy with his.  Or it's hurt.  All heck breaks loose.  All heck.  Whoa, all heck breaks loose.  Look out.  You're a nerd.  Yeah.  Oh, and really fast, Tiger Woods won a whole season without winning one golf tournament.  The golf season officially over.  It's over for him, right?  He came in fourth place.  Yeah, he'll come back.  The Australian Open, where they give out yellow jackets instead of green jackets.  Oh, ow.  Yeah.  Yeah, they get stung a lot.  It's got to hurt.  Imagine.  Imagine that's what you get if you want the tournament. 
[01:10:00]  They just release a bunch of yellow jackets at you.  You have to wave them off.  I thought this was going to be different.  Time for your yellow jacket.  They just rub honey all over you.  All over your nude body in front of the media.  Nude.  As you get your yellow jacket.  Do you have to be nude?  What they do is they just push you into a giant nest, and you clumsily fall into it,  and your hand goes through it.  Oh, God.  And you try to pull it off.  Oh, how horrible that is.  And when you pick it up, the whole nest comes with you, and you're shaking it, and you break  it on you, it's like trying to get cotton candy off you, or saran wrap. 
[01:10:30]  You're really painting a horrid picture.  Because I can imagine falling into a giant bee's nest, and just how your arm would sink  into it, which would enrage them.  Oh.  They would fly up your arm, and when your arm picked up, a big piece of the nest would  break off and come with you, and they would just be so unhappy.  Now they're just covered in bees that are mad and stinging you.  They would probably all be buzzing, which is that way they're going, do you believe  this motherfucker?  What's he doing?  Cut the malarkey, pal. 
[01:11:00]  Oh, boy.  What's this about?  Sean in Albany.  Sean.  Hey, guys.  What's up, brother?  I got a website you'll absolutely love.  It's called Kids in Mind.  Uncle Paul.  It's a movie rating site for adults, and it breaks down each use of profanity and violence  in the movie, including midget references and sexual connotation.  But wait, let me ask you a question.  Do they do anything with that, or is that only for parents' reference?  No, I think it's just for parents' reference. 
[01:11:30]  Then it's great.  Just check it out and read some of the descriptions they have for references to little people.  How about Megaminds, a big movie?  I saw that there.  Go with one that's kind of in theaters right now.  That's what parents should do.  Have a website where they can go, and they can make informed decisions about what they  want their kids to see so they don't have to bother the fucking rest of us.  As long as it doesn't affect adults and their entertainment.  Fuckers.  Have one parent watch it, write down everything naughty on the website, and then as a parent, 
[01:12:00]  you make that decision.  I'm just going to watch these movies with my kid.  I'm not going to watch it ahead of time.  If there's something in there, maybe I'll fucking teach him a little something.  Show him the under-blanket Jack.  Do you want to hear about all the sex that's in Megamind 3D?  Oh, yeah, sure do.  Sex says here that twice, a woman kisses one of two men briefly.  Okay.  In another scene, she holds hands with one of them while laying side-by-side on a picnic blanket.  Oh, hard.  In another scene, she's carrying groceries, and she's anally raped by three men of different 
[01:12:30]  colors.  They push her face into the lettuce, sodomize her brutally in the park.  Another scene in Megamind.  With a baguette.  An animated woman wearing tight clothing that accentuates a large bosom and wide hips and  thighs, and wears one low neckline that reveals a shadow of cleavage.  We're talking about a cartoon here.  We see a pair of men's underwear hanging on a clothesline.  Oh, shit.  That's risque.  That's sexy.  Watch out.  Yeah.  Did you... 
[01:13:00]  Did you...  What show is that on?  Some dude becomes a hot chick, and then after living as a hot chick, decides he doesn't  want to be a hot chick anymore, and goes back to being a dude.  Did anyone else see this over the weekend?  Yeah.  The most Jim has fucked?  Oh.  That's a good show.  You happen to check this out?  No.  Is it a documentary?  I think it was on MSNBC or something, when they get all weird.  MSNBC gets really just fucking weird during the weekend.  Yeah.  During the weekend, they get all weird. 
[01:13:30]  They get the lockdowns, the lockups, all that shit going on.  Yeah.  Crime things, murders, mysteries.  Yeah.  But this guy became a...  They said, by the way, because I'm like, that don't look like a hot chick to me.  But they kept saying he became a hot fucking go-go dancer chick.  He had to hide his package while he was dancing.  Yeah, it's called a gaffe, what they put it back with.  A gaffe?  It's like a thong with something hard inside of it.  Like a thong with a piece of car... 
[01:14:00]  Like Jim's dick?  No.  No, but they have something to hold their dick back against their crotch.  Really?  A crotch, yeah.  It was called a gaffe, I think.  I could be saying that wrong.  And you can't tell?  I don't know.  If they're in a bikini?  I don't know, maybe.  I guess it depends on the nationality, but the Asian ones, I'm sure, no.  Black ones probably have to wear shorts.  Soccer shorts.  We've all done the talk just for, you know, shits and giggles, right?  What's the gaffe?  It's a gaffe.  Oh, it's a gaffe.  It's $16, and it's in stock.  I put gaffe into Google, and one of the first sponsored links was the Transgendered's Boutique. 
[01:14:30]  It's called Ruffles and Lace.  Yes.  What else can you get there?  Oh, I don't know.  Let's see.  Let's see.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, you can get, like, something that makes your butt look better?  Little girdles?  All sorts of sexy things.  Yeah, there's all kinds of nice, sexy stuff there.  Yeah, girdles and bustiers.  Oh.  A bustier.  Yes, they should.  Breast forms.  Breast forms.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, there you go.  They're fake tits that just stick on your hairy chest. 
[01:15:00]  Hey, hey, hey.  Oh, God.  Your hairy chest.  Brannies.  Enough.  You're not fooling anyone.  Well, speak for yourself.  Hi, Jimmy.  Oh, whatever.  No one saw the show, so that was fine.  But how fucked up are you that you go from a guy to a girl and then say, no, I've got  to go back to being a guy?  And, of course, we end up there. 
[01:15:30]  Well, you always end up there, don't you?  Ex-hamster.  Let's say hi to Mike in PA.  Mike.  Mike.  What's up, fellas?  Hey, brother.  When I was 12 years old, my grandmother took a bunch of guests to go see a nice little  movie called Apocalypse Now.  Oh.  I turned out okay, right?  Yeah.  I don't see anything wrong with it, man.  I don't know.  Great movie.  You've got to know what your kid can handle.  It's as simple as that.  Yep.  And I think if you keep them away from all that stuff, you're going to fucking raise 
[01:16:00]  a weirdo.  Let's be honest with each other.  Something's going to go wrong with the wiring.  But I couldn't handle Bonnie and Clyde.  Told that.  Right.  Fucking, oh, my God.  But your parents got to be aware also.  You just don't fucking bring your kid to everything.  You've got to realize what your kid can handle.  They knew I was sensitive, crying Anthony.  Right.  So they knew I was a little pussy and couldn't handle the shooting and fucking bloodshed. 
[01:16:30]  When Blanche gets her fucking eye shot out.  Oh, yeah.  And then at the end, when they just get mowed down, Bonnie and Clyde get mowed down, I was  throwing up.  I was throwing up in the car.  Really?  Yeah.  Whoa, he's throwing up!  Oh, that was the drive-in, too, right?  Yeah, it was the drive-in.  Why didn't you run around with the rest of the kids while the movie's being shown?  Because he's a dick.  I was afraid to leave the car.  Someone might kidnap me.  That's the greatest thing, just running around.  You don't give a shit about the movie.  I was very afraid of leaving the vehicle. 
[01:17:00]  Because when you're a kid, in my day, they just left the kids in the car when they went  in.  They were like, well, we'll be out in a few minutes.  And then they leave us in the car.  And if some guy or something was going to his car, which was parked next to ours, I'd be  all like, thinking he was going to come in and fucking steal me.  Because I was precocious.  I was definitely a pussy growing up, too.  I was always just petrified of everything.  Yeah, your father would lock the car door. 
[01:17:30]  Good thing.  That followed you, right, Uncle Paul?  I used to have to get a hanger.  Or like he says, a hanger.  A hanger.  Hanger.  Hanger.  Hanger.  And one day, my mom left us in the car.  It was me, my brother, and my sister.  And some guy walks right up the window.  And he's like, hey, how you doing?  And I literally looked at him.  And with my eyes huge with fear, just went, you started crying.  Like that.  And he's like, oh, I'm sorry. 
[01:18:00]  I'm sorry.  He's like, you know, I'm friends with your mother.  I just wanted to see.  And I was just the dick.  He probably went back and went, Jesus Christ, you little faggot son, Anthony, freaked out.  I said to her, oh, I just go over to say hi to the boy.  See, I knew.  And he's all of a sudden crying.  I knew better.  I tell him to pull his trousers down, make sure he's not sweating in the car.  I always thought I was going to be stolen.  By who?  I don't know.  A faggot salesman? 
[01:18:30]  I would have been with their best seller, their commodities.  Yeah.  It just, I was so afraid of being stolen.  Where does that come from?  I was like fucking a little kid.  A diluted view of one's value.  When you think you were going to be stolen.  That's true.  It's like somebody, let's say somebody putting a turd on the shelf and hiring a security guard  to watch it in the store.  We don't want anybody stealing this wet lump of shit. 
[01:19:00]  We don't disrespect the comparison.  We're not taken.  You weren't going to be stolen.  You were going to just be used.  Exactly.  Well, that's what I thought.  Like, I was just going to test drive you and give you back.  Raped and handed back.  And I didn't even, at that age, I swear, I didn't know anything about sexual abuse or anything.  I just thought that I was going to be taken.  I didn't know what for.  I didn't know what the end game would have been after being taken and kidnapped.  Maybe ransom.  I don't know.  But I always thought I was going to be, like, kidnapped. 
[01:19:30]  Like, stolen.  Taken away.  I was very fearful of any sounds in the house.  Open windows.  Things like that.  And, of course, it hasn't carried over into my adult life.  No, at least now you handle it well.  I have surveillance cameras and weapons.  Pistols.  Lock the door and alarm systems.  You worry that Diaz brothers are just going to come up.  You never know.  Oh, Frank, what's better?  For a putz.  Can we go back to Tranny's?  We got an ex-copper.  No, you don't even have to ask that.  You should just say, we're heading back to Tranny's. 
[01:20:00]  And you have one out of three needed votes.  That's right.  Trannyville.  Just pick that up.  Bill in Brooklyn.  Bill.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hello, Bill.  What's up?  Listen, I used to arrest a female prosecutor.  Boo!  Boo!  What?  Oh, hi, Bill.  Hey, Bill.  We're doing stuff.  Now you've got to slow down and back up a little bit.  You just get a little fucking manners.  So what happened, Bill?  They used to take a tampon, take the string, tie it around the head of their cock, and shove 
[01:20:30]  the tampon up their ass.  Wow.  For the ultimate tuck?  And that would give them the ultimate tuck.  God damn.  Works like an anchor.  Yeah.  It's nice.  Get the fuck out of here.  You sneeze, and all of a sudden, the gig's up.  It looks like your cock has lynched a tampon.  It swings.  All right.  All right.  Is that true, you think?  Yeah.  Really?  Strange fruit dangling from your cock.  It's got a log on it.  There's a fucking...  It's now a Lincoln Log set. 
[01:21:00]  There's a cock with a tampon and a little brown nugget on the end.  Nugget.  It's fucking horrible.  Fingernail.  Men's cum.  Whatever else would come out of an asshole.  Of course.  Can't think of anything.  Condom.  Guest pitches.  Never ends.  Do you guys want George Bush?  Yes.  Of course we do.  Hey, I haven't been there in months.  Why?  Thank God.  Oh, jeez. 
[01:21:30]  No, I mean, they're still doing the impression.  Yes, of course.  Yahoo News, Danny.  Just made an article about things you can't say at work.  This is right down our...  Well, well.  Duck.  You haven't seen the last of me.  You'll have to kill me before you fire me.  I'll teach you motherfuckers.  I'll teach you a lesson.  I'd like a raise, please.  Oh, that's just here.  Oh, yeah.  The link is HTTP, semicolon, backspace, backslash, backslash, backslash, finance.yahoo.com, slash, 
[01:22:00]  career-work, slash...  I love those.  Remember when you used to have to give addresses like that?  All right, type HTTP...  But at this point, when someone says www, it's just like, shut the fuck up, what's the website?  Yeah, it's just whatever it is, .com, shut up.  Thank you.  Shut up.  You can't find...  Oh, it's on feedback?  Yeah, it's on feedback.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, it's a work thing.  We like beating the shit out of the workplace. 
[01:22:30]  Yes.  Or what they're doing to the poor people out there.  The workplace.  I even hate the word.  I hate that word.  The workplace.  You know, it's...  Shut up.  We still got it good, even though they fucked it up here a lot, but the regular workplace...  I don't know how they do it.  It's unbelievable.  I don't know how you go to work.  Like, Cubicle City and stuff?  Because that at least had all that other stuff going on where it made it bearable.  Yeah.  With the dirty jokes and making fun of the secretary with the cleavage, maybe pinch a hiney. 
[01:23:00]  Look at the mimeograph I hung up.  I hung up mimeographs.  Maybe fucking, you know...  They're all racist.  Just sit on the copy machine.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Play, whose pussy lips are these?  At the old Christmas party.  You always heard about Christmas party shenanigans, too.  Who has a Christmas party at this point?  No one even has Christmas parties at work.  Everyone's broke.  That went easily five, six years ago.  Yeah.  The end of the Christmas party.  Because I guess that led to a lot of lawsuits. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  And also money that the company doesn't want to spend on their employees.  Yeah, well, that's a big thing, too.  But yeah, you'd get things that would happen, and it would be like, just because it's a  party doesn't mean, you know, the HR criteria isn't still in place.  And you'd sit there and get all fucking tanked up and start squeezing secretary ass.  Right.  Ugh.  What is this, the ten worst things to say at work?  Worst things to say? 
[01:24:00]  Does that mean politically incorrect, or things that'll get your, like, fired?  I don't know, let's find out.  See how lame this shit is.  You can't even find it.  Forbes.  How about you make your website easy to fucking navigate, Forbes?  Continue to say, oh boy.  What the fuck are they doing?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's not politically incorrect things.  It's things that'll, like, leave it to a fan to give us a link to something that sucks  a dick.  Well, it's not only going to add potential, the ten worst things to not say at work. 
[01:24:30]  Or the things you can't say at work.  It's not things you can't say.  Is this different than the Yahoo News thing there, Danny?  No, it's the same thing.  This is the full article.  All right, whatever.  Might be another dead end.  No surprise there.  Oh, of course.  We have Russell Simmons coming in today.  Yes.  Oh, yeah?  830.  What's he promoting?  I don't know.  It's a reality show on oxygen.  Yes.  What?  What is it?  Is it, like, positive?  I don't know.  Reinforcement shit?  What is he doing? 
[01:25:00]  I do not know.  What is this?  What is it?  What does he do?  It's a reality show?  Running Russell Simmons at 10 p.m. on oxygen?  What is this?  What is it?  Isn't that a chick channel?  Oxygen?  Oh, yeah, it is.  Oh, yeah, it is.  I watched the logo.  You watched the logo, huh?  Oh, yeah.  I watched the gay channel. 
[01:25:30]  When is he coming in?  830?  830.  Sam was running down the hall.  Uh-oh.  We talked about your 19-inch TV.  Yeah.  We're done with you and your 19-inch TV.  Exactly.  I noticed you hit after that segment.  Thank God.  What do you mean hit?  I had work to do.  Because the rage continued long after you walked down that hall.  Yeah.  None of us understand.  Do you have another job?  Get it?  None of us understand the 19-inch TV.  I was just going to come in and tell you about Russell Simmons' show.  I know, but we're still fucking pissed off.  Make it better.  Are you going to watch Russell Simmons' show on your 19-inch television? 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  Hell yeah.  In HD.  In HD.  What's the Russell Simmons show all about?  What?  It's on Oxygen because it's about the, uh...  Oh, my goodness.  Bottom screen?  I don't know.  Oh, look how cute!  Come on!  Baby chimps are adorable.  They really have to shake your hand.  Look at him.  He's in a little suit.  They put him in little suits.  I'm sure the chimps love that.  When you come over one day and they eat your friend's face for 20 minutes.  They can't get enough of your... 
[01:26:30]  And their genitals.  Yeah.  You think that ape is the hero of the ape world?  Believe me, that's the Colin Ferguson of fucking chimps.  They all fucking root for the fact that he struck back.  Greatest story ever.  Yeah.  That's the office shooter of chimps.  Yeah.  They're all just happy.  And he fucking finally fought back against humanity.  Oh, look at how cute the little thing is.  It's a wild baby chimp taking his first little steps.  And then he's asking for his mommy.  Why don't you get one of those, Ant, for the compound?  Oh, no. 
[01:27:00]  Why not?  I don't know.  I can make 800 jokes why I wouldn't.  It is very cute, though.  They're adorable.  They get bigger, they'll fuck you up, though, man.  It's mommy.  Aw.  Look at his big ears.  They're very petable.  It's like George Burns before he died.  It does.  You know, what would George Burns sound like if he sang an extreme song?  Ah, excuse me.  Right, Anthony?  Do that while we figure out what George Burns would sound like as a tire iron was slashed  in his fucking mouth.  What would George Burns' teeth sound like being cracked out with a tire iron while he sings? 
[01:27:30]  I'd love to hear that one.  Fucking good blackjack to the side of his head.  Oh, God.  What is this Russell Simmons thing about?  Can we cancel?  No, you can't cancel.  No, I'm just asking.  Just putting that out there.  It follows the women who control Russell Simmons' life, his confidants, his assistants, his  friends, his interns.  The tagline for Running Russell Simmons, that's the name of the show, is behind every good 
[01:28:00]  man is a good woman, but behind every American mogul stands many great women.  It's too long.  You should say every mogul.  That's whatever.  However, the show displays what it's like to keep Russell's life going and features the  many women who help him, including his confidants, assistants, interns, and more.  He's probably worth a quarter billion dollars.  You think?  He sold Fat Farm for $140 million.  Yep.  Wow.  He started Def Jam with Rick Rubin. 
[01:28:30]  He's a rich fucking guy, man.  He's worth a few bucks.  Yeah.  Maybe you can get money off him for a bigger TV, Sam.  You think he'd buy me a big TV?  God, someone's got to.  Just as a special interest story, he'll tell me you're retarded.  All right, so Russell's going to be in at 8.30.  And he'll be out by 8.40, so that's good.  He's got a lot to say.  I'm looking forward to speaking to you.  You got a lot to say?  Yes.  I am, too.  Everything, and living life not only as a rich person financially, but spiritually as well.  Well, he reportedly gained attention by calling for the removal of words like a nigger, bitch, and ho 
[01:29:00]  from the clean radio edited versions of rap songs.  So it's not just the cursing he wanted out for clean radio.  I guess he's okay with it being on, like, the albums.  The albums, yeah.  That's fine.  So if you want to take it home and do it, all right.  I can't believe they don't want to say bitch anymore, either.  Well, more biatch.  He probably realizes also it brings too much fucking heat.  It's almost like if you have an edgy album cover for Walmart, it's not worth the bullshit 
[01:29:30]  you take for it because there's too many stores to sell it in, so you make a nicer album cover.  It's probably the same thing.  It's like, why deal with the crap?  And this way people have no excuse to ask you to censor.  It's like, you know what I mean?  It's like, if it's not on free radio so your fucking dumb kids can't hear it, then they  can't complain.  He's attempting to clean up his backyard, right?  Maybe, yeah.  A little bit.  Yeah, yep.  But you should be able to say bitch on the news.  Yeah.  They do in certain dog stories.  I've seen that. 
[01:30:00]  And they kind of make like a ha-ha-ha joke about it.  You know, oh, there's a bitch.  We're talking the pet store here.  Ridiculous.  And look at the cunt holding the bitch.  Wait a minute.  Are we on?  Somebody's suggesting that Russell Simmons has so much money, he could buy you a television.  Maybe we should ask.  We should ask him, too.  I said that already.  We just said that.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, we did 10 minutes.  I was reading.  I think Jimmy said it.  I was reading somebody actually doing it at the time you were talking about it, perhaps. 
[01:30:30]  What a coinkydink.  Yeah, we said that hopefully he'll buy a...  If Russell Simmons gives me money for a TV, I'll buy a TV today.  If it's from Russell Simmons, that'd be the greatest thing ever.  You know, we should ask Russell Simmons if he'll buy you a TV because he's so rich.  I need a TV.  Yeah, that's a good idea.  Yes.  You're a big Russell Simmons fan?  Well, yeah, for what he's done.  For what reason?  For what he's done for hip-hop.  I mean, he's taken it to the next level.  He's made it a mainstream thing.  He was one of the...  One of the guys who has done that.  Who else?  Well, on an artistic level, your Jay-Zs and guys like that brought it there. 
[01:31:00]  Your Jay-Zs.  How many are there?  Eminem.  Eminem, yeah.  There's eight Jay-Zs.  Eight Jay-Zs?  And there's five Eminem.  But in terms of...  Run DMC, though.  First real crossover by putting Rock with...  Yes, love the Run DMC.  Your Run DMCs.  In terms of opening up the business...  Is he one of the Run DMC guys?  No, his brother is.  I know.  I'm just fucking around.  You're Sam Roberts.  I don't know.  Sam Roberts.  There's only one.  How great is it...  He's more famous than his Run DMC brother.  He's the boss.  I know he is. 
[01:31:30]  But also, business-wise, he...  Are you a Kanye West fan?  Big Kanye West fan.  He's a cunt.  Huge.  In fact, the new album comes out.  He's just an idiot.  He's a baby is what he is.  He is an asshole.  Is he a baby?  What is it?  Baby.  He's a baby.  He's a little baby boy.  But he's...  Look, he's...  I like his music.  He's extremely talented, but he's just a jerk.  And that's how much you know his music is good, because I can't stomach him, and I still  like his stuff.  Yeah, he can't put out a bad album.  George Bush don't like black people.  One of the greatest things ever.  Hamna, hamna, hamna.  One of the few things I like that he did. 
[01:32:00]  Stupid Mike Myers.  Can we...  Mike Myers, ah, hamna, hamna, hamna.  Can we go over it again?  God, it's too funny.  Just that he fucking...  He just didn't go off the...  That horse shit Mike Myers was reading.  Ugh.  I lost respect for Mike Myers.  Mike, you gotta...  Did you have any?  I don't like that he said that, but at least he went on a book.  He did have a good run after SNL.  And then he fell off the fucking cliff one day.  He put out that fucking Love Guru movie, and that was it.  That was his death knell.  That's the only reason we got him on our show.  I know.  Because it was such a bad movie. 
[01:32:30]  He needed all the help he could get.  We got him as he was plummeting.  We saw two seconds of him as he plummeted past us.  Mm-hmm.  Back into obscurity.  All right, why don't we...  Kong-yay, motherfucker.  Yeah, he didn't want to perform for the Today Show.  The Today Show because of the interview that he did with Matt Lauer.  He thought he was mistreated.  That they played the audio of him underneath the interview, which is done all the time.  It's just done.  Like, occasionally they'll be talking to somebody.  They'll put the clip, lowly put the audio under him. 
[01:33:00]  And he threw a hissy fit about that.  I wouldn't mind if it was the video, but if they're playing audio under his explanation,  I almost understand it because it's like, then you're going to...  What do you listen to?  If they play the audio and then show it, but to play it under it while the guy's talking,  it's like, what are you guys doing?  It is a dumb thing, but they weren't trying to single him out as something.  He really took it personally.  It's a dumb thing to do, but they do it to other people.  And I don't mind Kanye West for doing what he did with Mike Myers, the whole, you know, 
[01:33:30]  George Bush doesn't like black people, whatever.  I don't even care about that.  The Taylor Swift one was like...  That was despicable.  That was why I don't like the fuck.  I actually like this type of TV.  And he always bitches about NMTV, the awards.  He's always like, he's a crybaby when he doesn't win.  What he had to say about Bush, that was his opinion.  And I liked it as far as watching TV.  But the Taylor Swift thing, it was like, what are you fucking doing?  He didn't present his opinion, by the way.  Oh, I know.  He just said George Bush doesn't like...  I know, you're right.  President Bush doesn't like black people. 
[01:34:00]  Really?  But he's never put out a bad song.  He is good.  Every single thing he's put out has been amazing.  No.  All of it.  Really?  Stronger's a good song.  I don't listen.  Every album he's put out.  Diamonds of Forever's a good song.  And this album that's coming out, he has...  That's all I know.  He looks like an asshole.  Well, he is an asshole, but he's okay with that.  Does anyone like him?  Who likes him?  Musically?  Yeah.  Everybody likes him.  No, who likes him as a person?  Jay-Z's his best friend.  Really?  Then we better shut the fuck up. 
[01:34:30]  This is a big time.  Jay-Z knows people.  Jay-Z knows he's an ass, though.  I'm sure.  I'm sure he knows he's an ass, but he knows he's an ass.  He doesn't care.  Because he knows that the Today Show needs him more than he needs the Today Show at this  point.  All right.  Well, it leads to our big Russell Simmons interview, which is happening at 830.  Let's say hi to Corey in North Carolina.  Corey, getting ready for the big Russell Simmons interview.  What do you got?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hey.  Hi.  I don't know if you know this, but when the Crown Zero mosque stuff was going on, he was  a really big proponent of the mosque.  He put some kind of a... 
[01:35:00]  I already got that to ask him about, but he put something...  Oh, good.  We got to ask him about that.  Yeah, but he didn't...  I don't know if he was...  He was more like...  He put some kind of a message on his place on the outside, which was kind of saying that  everybody, you know, freedom for all religions or whatever.  You know, whatever.  It's like, yeah, we understand.  They're free, but it's not the point.  We'll ask him about that.  We should look that up.  Yeah, I don't know exactly what it was.  Yeah, we better be prepared for that.  Oh, boy.  All right.  We'll take a quick break.  Wait, I got to plug something.  Oh, go, Jimmy.  Go.  Jimmy, Jimmy.  Where's Jimmy? 
[01:35:30]  Two things.  One, Poughkeepsie this weekend, Friday, Saturday.  Two shows Friday, two shows Saturday at Bananas Comedy Club.  I don't know if I have the number here, if I do.  I don't.  We just give the website.  How about the number, too?  The fucking website?  BananasComedyClub.com.  That might be it.  And tomorrow, I have a huge show announcement.  Oh.  It will go on sale Friday.  It's for Atlantic City.  But I'm very, very happy we got this show together. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, man.  Yeah, it's actually a good one.  I can't oversell it, but it's a great fucking show.  Oh, shit.  And I think people will love it.  Others involved?  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  Want a hint?  You and, uh...  No hints!  The virus.  Sirius XM.  This is the OBNN3 Show.  Doot, doot, doot.  Russell Simmons will be on the show in a few minutes.  I saw Jay-Z just walk into the building, by the way, Sam. 
[01:36:30]  Are you going to try to get a picture?  Yeah.  How are you going to approach Jay-Z so he doesn't think you're a total tool that just bought a 19-inch television?  Tell him about your 19-inch television and make it sound like, yo, I know how to, like, live large, yo.  I don't know if I would say that.  I don't know if I'll try to approach Jay-Z.  No?  It's a big deal to me.  Do we have a couple minutes to do the Derek thing, or is Russell Simmons signing in?  Where's Russell Simmons right now?  Well, he hasn't signed in yet, but, I mean, if you start the Derek thing, he might come in in the middle of it.  I would like to hear that Derek thing, by the way. 
[01:37:00]  What happened with Derek and blind Stevie there, Sam?  Well, you know how sometimes monsters get created out of these interns that are a little silly?  Especially when they're given titles like executive intern.  Stevie, worst intern ever.  Nope.  Worst person.  Really?  You don't think so?  Uh, no.  I'm not talking about, like, eyepatch guy was.  Eyepatch guy was pretty bad.  Was pretty bad.  My name is Luca.  Luca?  Well, she left, didn't she?  She, like.  After we acknowledged her black eye. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  Hence why we called her Luca.  But I just think he's the worst intern.  Well, he's also, like, completely disrespectful to everybody on staff.  Yes.  Except for me.  Oh, oh, okay.  Because I think he likes that I give him titles like executive intern.  You're his trainer.  That's what it is.  Yeah.  You can't just walk into a lion's cage at a circus.  Yeah.  You're going to get mauled.  But the trainer can go in there.  He'll be fine.  Yeah.  Stevie, Stevie lets the teeth out on everybody.  And, uh, I mean, and he gets picked on too, but I guess everybody gets picked on. 
[01:38:00]  So what did he do Friday?  Because we don't have a lot of time here.  Well, I got an.  Because Russell Simmons might come down that hall any second.  I got an email that after I left, uh, he had thought it was a funny joke to steal Derek's  credit card.  Yeah, that's hysterical.  That's a weird prank.  Because Derek gave him the credit card to get him lunch.  And so he gave Derek back the lunch, put his credit card in his pocket.  And then Derek went home not realizing he didn't have his credit card.  Oh, that's great.  Send him home for a weekend without your fucking credit card.  How dumb is Derek to be ripped off by Bobo?  Yeah.  What an idiot.  It was Stevie. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, oh.  Either way, though.  Oh, either way, you're right.  They're interchangeable.  But so then Derek called him and said, look, I'm at Penn Station.  You know, getting it back.  What?  You took it on purpose, though.  You also had every intention of seeing.  But usually.  I had that work out for you.  Usually a prank ends, like, you know, it doesn't, it doesn't continue all weekend long.  Well, what happened?  Especially with someone that could get you in a lot of fucking trouble.  Your fly's open.  Why is your fly open?  Don't touch my cross.  It's constantly open.  They were poking him in the dick. 
[01:39:00]  I had to make sure it was open.  He goes, don't touch my crotch.  Yeah.  Oh, we all just want to touch your crotch.  It does happen from time to time.  Well, Sam, let's not even go there.  All right, to the point.  Really, Stevie.  I had no intention of stealing it.  What happened was I was going to go to Wendy's, bring a whole, because, you know, I enjoy my  lunch.  Why is your nose clogged?  I don't know.  It's just one of those days.  Food in there.  Are you?  There's food in there.  Is it allergies?  I don't know.  I don't know why.  Dipping sauce.  Yeah.  Well, what happened was, honey mustard running out his fucking nose. 
[01:39:30]  I was going to bring a whole big bag of Wendy's back, right?  And I was going to go up to him and give him the credit card, and he was going to think  that I had bought the Wendy's with his credit card, because I had a huge bag of Wendy's,  right?  Oh, so that was going to be your big gag?  Well, because I know he was going to be like, dude, what'd you do?  You bought Wendy's with my credit card?  He's graduated from the E-Rock School of Humor.  Yeah.  This would be a great prank.  Oh, the face E-Rock just gave you, Danny.  Yeah, he made a face.  Damn, he didn't care for that.  He didn't like that at all.  The face he made was sheer hunger. 
[01:40:00]  Old Frankenstein dude didn't like that.  Hey, it's his wedding haircut.  He's getting married this week.  Aw, shit.  Who cut your hair?  Peter Cushing?  What?  So this is a crazy prank there, Stevie.  We might have to call the jackass guys.  That's wild.  You're perfect.  Well, what happened was when I went down to get the Wendy's, and I came back, and he  had flown the coop.  He was gone.  He just went home.  It was the weekend. 
[01:40:30]  Well, I know, but it wasn't a getaway, stupid.  I didn't know he was going to be leaving so early, because he doesn't usually leave  early.  Did you purposely not give him his credit card back?  No.  I wasn't going to steal it from him.  No, did you purposely go down to get lunch with his credit card when you could have already  given it back to him?  Yeah, that was the prank.  Your pranks are terrible.  Where's the prank?  Yes, E-Rock?  He didn't realize Derek was gone, because he came back, and for a while he was sitting  on the chair in the office, dipping french fries into a large Frosty, and then going  through his pockets and realizing, he goes, oh, wow, I still have Derek's credit card, 
[01:41:00]  and then that's how we found out.  So it was stupidity?  It started as a prank, and then it went on too long, because he forgot.  He was pranking him.  Oh, God.  Is that right, Steve?  I don't know what E-Rock said, because I don't have headphones.  Why would you have headphones on?  Why go for them?  That's stupid, right?  Who cares?  All right.  So that's the setup, and we're going to have the audio of Derek talking to you today?  Derek apparently gave you a little...  Talking to. 
[01:41:30]  Talking to.  I think Travis was genius enough to turn on the old iPhone recorder.  Thank God.  By the way, out of all the interns that we've ever had, Stevie is the only intern that I  actually had to say to the guys, all right, let's just cut the shit for two seconds and  actually have a discussion about this kid.  And have a real discussion about him.  Because that never, ever happens.  I hear you.  It happened with Stevie.  All right.  Well, we're going to continue this little storyline after the big Russell Simmons interview.  Please leave before Russell Simmons sees you.  Russell Simmons is coming in here.  Thank God. 
[01:42:00]  I want to feel like an idiot.  Yeah, of course not.  Russell Simmons coming in.  There he is.  Russell Simmons.  Hey, Mr. Simmons.  How are you, sir?  Hey, Russell.  Good to see you again.  Take a seat right there.  Well, we're hanging out doing this radio show thing.  What are you listening to?  Anything good?  Early in the morning.  What are you listening to?  Anything good?  Blackberry, baby.  I'm typing.  I'm typing.  I'm working.  Always business.  Always working, right?  It's always working.  Why do you have a Blackberry?  Do you still like the little buttons?  I could never use them again.  Really?  Yeah, because you get used to it.  They're all iPhone guys. 
[01:42:30]  But you get used to it, though.  You get used to it.  I'm a Blackberry guy.  You can.  Yeah, you can.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I can't type nothing on that.  Because you're used to feeling the buttons.  Yeah.  I'm telling you, you get used to it.  I had the fake Blackberry when you try to make the buttons pop.  Oh, that was the worst phone.  The Storm?  That was a bad phone.  The Storm was terrible.  It was terrible.  The new shit ain't too good either.  Yeah, I know.  No, I didn't buy it.  The torch?  Yeah.  My man's got it.  He's like a big tech guy.  He's the first one to have it.  And it keeps freezing on.  You see all the commercials on TV, so you know they're not doing well.  Yeah, right?  You know, I wouldn't even participate. 
[01:43:00]  I wouldn't say nothing.  I would simply have said, I like Blackberry.  Yeah, I wanted the torch bad, but it's obvious.  No, it's no good.  Like I said, with all the commercials they're running, that means they're in trouble.  That's why Russell's almost a billionaire, though, because he's smart.  He thinks of ways to make money.  I wish I had the money motherfuckers that I got.  I have five suffering charities and all these social and political.  I could give my money to so much stuff.  I'm building a financial service company.  Really?  Wow.  Yeah.  It's going to change the bank.  It really is already changing the lives of a lot of people. 
[01:43:30]  That's a bold statement, changing the banking industry?  Yeah.  It's bold, right?  It's nutty to say that, right?  What is the background on that?  I have this, eight years ago, I started a business, Unirush, and it's for underserved  communities with the idea that they didn't have any credit cards and they had to go to  the bank and get online.  They couldn't, I'm sorry, they couldn't go to the bank.  They were not allowed in the bank.  You know, there's 70 million Americans who have no bank accounts.  They get their check.  They go get online.  They cash their check.  And after they cash their check, they get online to pay their bills, one after another. 
[01:44:00]  It could take eight hours a week.  They can't order shit off online.  They can't rent a car.  They can't rent a hotel room.  They're locked out.  They get online with their family to pay their phone bill.  Wait, we got 70 million Americans?  Like that.  Can't have a bank account.  I have no idea.  And banks don't want the rest of us.  That's what really makes our industry so interesting, the business I'm in, is because you can build  credit.  You can, you know, it's a stored value card.  It's a prepaid credit card, but also it's a financial service company where we give away  health care benefits.  We give away credit building services. 
[01:44:30]  We give away budgeting services.  You can transfer money card to card.  Instead of going to Western Union and paying a fortune, use your phone and you can send money.  So that's the beginning of, and it's cheaper to operate than a free Bank of America bank  account.  So now it's move your money from Bank of America to my industry.  What kind of insurance for it?  Because they have like the FDIC, I guess, to insure.  Is the money insured?  Where is it?  It's insured.  What?  I don't know.  I'm saying.  What are you saying?  Like I'm going to waste your money?  No, no, no.  But how does that work? 
[01:45:00]  No, a bank holds the money.  I mean, and I just, and I represent, you know, this whole, it's called Unirush financial services.  And I just sold a piece to a big banker, but only enough so they can't like corrupt it.  And I sold another piece to a tech company, a little piece.  And they're ones who, you know, they're great.  They help build Facebook.  And so between the two of them, they're really, you know, really ambitious.  But, you know, they're $30, $40 billion companies.  And they look at this industry and they understand what I've been building. 
[01:45:30]  And I was the first.  Now Walmart's got a card.  People, they're competitors.  I'm not alone.  Uh-huh.  Wow.  But it's a really special industry.  Where do you, you get a lot of, you have like a lot of faith in your ideas.  I definitely consider talking about financial services.  But if I get the, I'm saying the reason it had to do with getting more money to pay for  more charity or more, you know, kind of investment in people.  What was the first big, like, because you had, I mean, Def Jam Records.  That was it.  That was the first.  No, the first idea was I wanted to make a record and I hated college. 
[01:46:00]  I'm saying I was in my last year of college and I had a record Christmas rapid.  Oh, so it was actually you.  You weren't even born.  I was.  I'm older than I look.  Yeah.  Christmas rapid.  Yeah.  1979.  Curtis Blow.  Curtis Blow.  I left, I left the hood.  I got on my first plane and I went to Amsterdam.  Wow.  I got off the plane.  I was like, can I have some cocaine and some pussy?  They were like, yes, Mr. Simmons, you can.  I was like, oh shit, I got a hit.  I got a hit record.  It's a great thing to ask for when you get off any flight, actually.  Curtis Blow. 
[01:46:30]  What happened to Curtis?  What happened to a lot of the guys from like the 70s, early 80s?  Curtis Blow was on tour somewhere.  Oh, is he working?  But he also was a rapper.  Yes.  He's like Joey.  Why?  Rev said, like Rev said, preach on a Sunday, rap on a Monday.  Why do most old rappers go away, though?  You don't really see them still doing it like old rock guys.  Like classic rock, like Skinner tours.  Curtis Blow had two records.  He had Christmas Rapper and The Breaks.  He had some other records, but those two significant records.  And he still tours.  Grandmaster Flash is on the road.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, Sugar Hill Gang is on the road.  Goddamn. 
[01:47:00]  Sugar Hill Gang.  What ever happened to Just Ice?  See?  I'm saying he fucked with a guy.  He had one, you know.  Just Ice.  Is that what it is?  One record?  Yeah, he'd have a big.  What happened to Aha?  But I like to know.  These are guys that I was a teenager.  Just Ice, but he had one record.  Never even crossed over.  Never on the radio.  Okay.  He was never bigger.  He had a big, Latoya was a big hit.  The records we loved were artists who didn't have any, you know, kind of meaningful, I  mean, meaningful because culturally they were everything to us, but they were not big  pop records.  Right.  You know.  Hey, how old were you when you made your first million?  I don't know. 
[01:47:30]  Well, because you said out of college you were already doing good, huh?  No, no.  I had my first record out of college, but you know, you think about money.  It's like, you don't remember the moments when you got a check.  You remember the moments when you got on the radio.  I remember when I finally made money.  When I first got on the radio, you remember that more, so much more significant hearing  Christmas rapping on the radio than getting a check.  Yeah.  You know, I mean, you're really, it's more proof that you're here to give, not get all  the time.  And the shit you get is small compared to the work itself.  You know, like being in the studio and listening to Suck MC or Rockbox and being high and look 
[01:48:00]  at the speaker like, oh, fuck.  And what did I think?  Wait till I hear this.  You know what I mean?  Wait till I share this.  You know, make people happy.  That's really what you think.  You don't think, wait till I get paid from this motherfucker.  You don't really think that ever.  That means you had money growing up then.  No.  It means that money is small and that work is different from money.  You do a lot of charitable stuff.  Do you indulge yourself though?  Do you, do you like, you know, I have, you know, I don't know.  Like indulge how?  I don't know. 
[01:48:30]  I leave, I leave work every day, no matter what.  I don't care if the contracts are underpaid and the, and the partners have flown in and  the check is right there.  It's time to go to yoga.  I go to yoga every day.  No matter what.  What do you mean like materialistically?  Do you, do you indulge yourself in cars or, you know, some kind of just, you know, like  what a lot of people that have money kind of do.  They, they have one car.  I have a car.  I have two Volkswagens in the Hamptons and I have a car here, which is not embarrassing,  but it's kind of a hip hop car. 
[01:49:00]  When I went to campaign for the president, I had one and we went together.  McCain?  No, no.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  But I had one, Jay-Z had one, Kevin Laws had one, Steve Stout had one, Mary J. Blanche.  We all were there.  It was like a Maybach convention.  Oh, was it?  I don't have any, like I don't have a gold record, but I have one thing is this car and  I, and I ride around and it's comfortable.  Do you actually, do you ride it or do you have someone driving?  That's like, that's a chauffeur car.  My man who I grew up with would drive the car.  Okay.  You have to have a first class airline seat in the back.  They're fucking amazing cars. 
[01:49:30]  It's really a comfortable thing to have.  I've seen one of those before.  They should make that chair.  It's really about the seat since you're not driving.  It really is about that seat.  And that seat should not cost the money it costs.  Right.  Because it's all about the seat.  That's all it's about.  I could give a fuck about the drive of the car.  Yeah.  It's nice that it, you know, has decent shocks, but so do Toyotas, you know?  Sure.  With the woodwork in there though and everything.  Yeah, we don't give a fuck.  Whatever.  You should have a Maybach seat.  A Maybach seat.  That's the good thing about having money.  You buy what you want.  But the people you say.  I don't want anything else.  I don't even really need that.  I just don't need shit. 
[01:50:00]  Do people overestimate what you have?  I had a bathroom that was so far from my bedroom.  I think it's why I separated from my wife.  I was thinking to myself, I'm getting old, I'm going to pee on myself.  Before you make it to the bathroom.  I swear to you.  So, you know, I don't really need a lot of shit.  You can sit your ass in one seat at a time.  Period.  I don't give a fuck how many seats.  And in fact, if you have too many seats, it's uncomfortable.  Right?  No one's sitting in them.  They're a waste.  And you're wasting.  Empty seats.  But you can at least put your feet up on a stack of money.  That's kind of nice. 
[01:50:30]  An ottoman made of money.  Do you at least have a big TV?  Thank you.  I was heading that way.  This is very similar to what we went through with this guy.  He just bought himself a 19-inch TV.  19-inch.  Flat screen.  Exactly.  He just looked up in the air like, is that even possible?  Do they make those?  It's a computer monitor.  Yeah, it sounds like a...  It's like nothing.  He doesn't make a lot of money, but we were saying...  It's all the same shit, really.  It's all about the TV.  I have a bigger screen, I'm not saying it in a mean way.  And he doesn't buy himself shit. 
[01:51:00]  Apparently, he doesn't buy himself a lot of things.  Can you please...  How much did he spend on the TV?  $180.  Now, for $300, he could have got a much better TV.  He's not being smart.  He's being obsessively cheap.  Did he get the TV yet?  Did he actually leave the store with it?  Yeah.  Because I was going to give you $100.  Did he show him the picture really fast?  I really was going to give you $100.  Yeah, he was going to give him $100 for it.  It's insane.  You've got to take care of yourself a little bit.  You suck.  That's what we're getting at with all this.  So wait, do I have to leave soon?  I better talk about my show.  I'm going to get in trouble.  Yeah, you're sure, man.  Well, if you want to leave.  Yeah, but you don't have to leave.  I ain't got nowhere to go.  This fucking had me here half an hour early like I was a singer. 
[01:51:30]  It's true.  This morning, they had me come here a half an hour early like I was a singer.  Do they always do that to you because they think you're going to be late?  Or are they just obsessively?  I'm never late, and I don't like that.  I don't need to be told, you know.  Yeah, we got...  My publicist said, I didn't do it.  My assistant said, I didn't do it.  So why the fuck?  Who did it?  Somebody did it.  Somebody did it.  She said, I'll show you the email.  She said, I don't know.  I'll find the email for you.  Yeah, we understand the past.  That's his TV.  That's his 19-inch.  That's it right there, right?  Notice the cable box, which is longer than the TV. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, God bless you.  We're enraged.  Yeah, exactly.  The cable box is almost decided on the TV.  I'm going to give you $100.  That's the way to you.  Hey, bud.  Huh?  I still...  All right, bud.  And what are you up to?  You need it?  Yeah.  Are you an aspiring whore?  Don't take Russell's money.  Don't take it.  Don't take his money.  He can take his money.  He's got his wallet out.  Yeah, come on.  No, don't take it.  Oh, man.  Don't take Russell Simmons' money.  Why?  Oh, man.  I know he's a very charitable guy, but he's very charitable.  He's just cheap, Russell. 
[01:52:30]  He's not poor.  He's not poor.  He's just a cheap guy.  That's to take that piece of shit back and get a real TV.  Would you do that?  You have to put Russell's 100.  Would you do that?  Would you email us the picture of a different television, or are you happy with that?  If you give me the 100, I'll do it if you give me the 100.  All right, now you've got to give...  And I'll make sure he gets this.  Will you guys fire him if he doesn't get the TV?  Yes, we're going to fire him either way.  You don't get a bigger TV.  At least he'll have a bigger TV.  All right?  Yeah, you'll be watching a lot of that TV once we boot your ass out of here.  So why...  Thanks. 
[01:53:00]  I was on CNN all weekend, and the woman...  You know what the woman asked me?  Huh?  She was really sweet, though, Frederico.  I did that for an hour-and-a-half interview, and they cut it up to four or five different segments.  So every two hours, a different segment.  One was about my book, Super Rich, which is coming out in January.  One was about just the social and political stuff I do.  One was about the reality show, and they wanted to know why I use certain language on my show.  And it was kind of a tough moment where she said, would you like your daughter's...  I said, well, I said, who are these bitches in my bathroom?  I didn't say I got 200 bitches coming to my house. 
[01:53:30]  I had 200 women come to my house.  We raised $400,000 for Sarah Leung.  We had 200 Victoria's Secret girls.  Some of them were Sports Illustrated.  They came to my house, and then 100 men came, and we built a maternity ward.  It was Angels for Africa, which was the first of the series.  And she didn't really like the language I used when I said, who are these bitches in my bathroom?  And the CNN, it was challenging me in a way that was very uncomfortable.  And I felt, you know, that they didn't mention... 
[01:54:00]  They talk about the missing girl for four months that's from Brooklyn or whoever it is,  and they don't mention the 18,000 Africans that died yesterday for lack of clean water.  Or they don't mention the 200,000 Iraqi innocent Muslims, innocent civilians,  who die in our invasion or whatever we call it.  They don't mention the 10 billion suffering farm animals that die every year  and the greatest cause of global warming and cancer and every fucking thing else.  They don't mention...  They don't prioritize human suffering.  They don't prioritize...  So for them to say, you did that for ratings. 
[01:54:30]  She said, I use my language like that for ratings.  That's ridiculous.  And I felt, you know, I mean, that's just the kind of...  Of course they'll challenge you.  Oprah, anyone will challenge me.  And I'm not saying that...  But I have my own set of rules, and the show is about my own set of rules.  The gay rights, the animal rights, the violence in the communities.  These kind of subjects are covered on my show.  And I thought they were more important than the language,  but she got the one word when I say bitch.  How did you respond to her?  Never mind the maternity ward we built in Sierra Leone  as a result of the first episode, 
[01:55:00]  or the animal rights protests in the second episode,  or whatever it is.  So she responded okay, except that she cut out my response to her.  I said, I'm more concerned with animal rights than gay rights.  And then I said, but how do you justify your priorities?  Like, you make these choices.  They cut all that shit out.  Cut that out.  See, you should tape all your interviews...  You gotta go live.  Because this way they can never fuck you like...  Who goes around and tapes their interviews and shows what they cut out?  Farrakhan.  Who?  WWE?  Farrakhan probably does that.  Oh, Vince does that?  You should have every one of your interviews taped, 
[01:55:30]  so if they fuck you like that, you can put it online and show what they do.  She's a sweet enough woman, but I said...  She's not a sweet woman.  At CNN, don't you have priorities, too?  Don't you...  And is it for ratings that you choose?  It's only fair.  One guy's burning a book in fucking Alaska, wherever he was.  One guy with 30 people in his congregation burns a book,  and it causes protests around the world, international almost crisis,  because one nut burns a book.  And he didn't get to burn the book.  We made big news out of it.  Yeah, yeah.  That became the most important news item over all the suffering, 
[01:56:00]  all of the unconscious behavior,  all the silly shit that happens around them every day,  and they're the news.  And they cut it.  Yeah, they're pushing...  How sickening.  And they're pushing you.  You should be able to push them back.  Push them back a little.  They shouldn't cut it out.  It was my observation about their choices,  just like they had an observation about mine.  Do you feel that you're making a difference,  or do you feel that you're one of those one step forward,  three steps back kind of thing?  No, I don't like to feel that way.  I think that it's intention.  I wake up in prayer. 
[01:56:30]  I feel like I'm going to go out and give,  and I feel like some of the gifts are useful,  and I feel like I'm...  And I know the world is already going to be what it is.  You know, there's going to always be suffering.  There's always going to be, you know, something to change.  There's always going to be some...  But, you know, as a servant, you do what's right.  And what good is a byproduct of you?  If you do right action, then good is a byproduct.  And you hope that you can internalize it,  because, you know, you just...  I mean, a real... 
[01:57:00]  Some people just think the world is so perfect,  they don't have to do shit.  And they're just a servant,  but they've given away action completely.  And I think that's kind of the way I want to believe it.  Like, just go and give and don't worry.  Is it more spiritually based, or is it, like, karmic?  It's kind of karmic, spiritual stuff,  and the sacrifice is cleansing and good,  and, you know, the work is prayer, and that's it.  You know, you don't worry about...  You can't always worry about result,  because then you could be... 
[01:57:30]  It could pile up on you.  You only have control over your actions, not the results.  Do you feel you're sacrificing enjoying other things in life  for maybe something that, you know,  that you're looking for in the afterlife, or...?  What afterlife?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know if I'm going to be a snail.  What the fuck's going to happen?  I just think...  I just find that, you know,  like, people want satisfaction now.  I mean, I always would go out and get...  I've been sober for, you know,  and I've been a vegan for, you know, forever, right? 
[01:58:00]  So I would go out, and I would get high,  and I'd wake up and have a headache.  But I had fun the night before,  and the headache was worth it.  Then one day the headache wasn't worth it,  and the meditation in the morning,  you wanted clarity instead of the headache.  And you liked the morning meditation,  and it just felt better.  And that was what, you know...  And so you move towards these things  because you find out that your mother,  the preacher, the prophet,  the imam, the fucking whoever it is,  the monk, they tell you they're right.  So you try to...  Some of the stuff they tell you,  you learn that it's right.  And you find that, you know, 
[01:58:30]  no matter how many times you try to shift  the blame or the choice  to something less, you know,  holy.  I don't mean holy like holy.  I mean, like, you know what I mean?  Something you find that, yeah,  they were right.  So you get your ass whipped,  and you come back to operating in order.  It just seems like such a chore,  and this is selfish me talking,  such a chore to be so motivated  to do so much help.  I'm a yogi, not a priest.  I'm fucked up with a lot of things. 
[01:59:00]  I mean, I know I accept that, you know,  I'm confused about pussy.  Should I not say that?  No, you please say it, yeah.  I love it.  And I struggle with, you know,  I struggle with that.  I live on 7th Avenue.  I'm surrounded by a beautiful girl.  I know I'm going to be  somebody's bitch again.  But in the short term,  it's not, I'm not quite right.  When you said confused about pussy,  I thought we had a bond over trannies.  You know how much that hurt?  Oh, was I ready to...  Oh, that's good.  I was ready to jump in with both feet.  Your reality show is about 
[01:59:30]  the women behind the men, right?  Yes, not about those girls.  They're my heroes.  I work for them.  Yeah, and that's what I read about your show.  Is that the case?  I mean, are you...  I have one girl who's been with me  for 27 years.  Her name is Simone.  Last episode, she laid nude  in a pool of blood  on 42nd Street  covered with plastic  like produce, fresh produce.  And she's like since become  and always was  an animal rights hero  in the activist community.  I mean, so  that was one of her protests. 
[02:00:00]  She's been laying nude  in pools of blood  and with red, bloody, fake fur  and whatever, you know, forever.  But this particular one  we filmed  as part of one of our protests  and it went on television  and it was a big deal  to a lot of people.  Can I ask you a quick...  Because animal...  I'm kind of...  I eat meat  but I really am big on animals  being treated badly.  It drives me nuts.  Do you think that sometimes PETA  who I think are well-intentioned  or they go too far  and they lose people  that they wouldn't lose?  I know I have...  You have the Humane Society.  You have ASPCA.  It takes all levels of support 
[02:00:30]  for different...  You know, you had John Brown  and you had a legislator,  you know, for slavery  or you had somebody...  You know, somebody has to speak up  and I think what they do  is really valid  and I've negotiated deals  with major corporations  on their behalf  and when they come to the table  to negotiate with a company,  a KFC or somebody,  they come and they say,  listen,  why don't you get machines  to separate the chickens?  If you do this,  then over a period of three years  you'll make this much money  and it'll be that much better.  You know, even... 
[02:01:00]  You'll make more.  The world will be...  You know, we'll be happy.  We won't fuck with you  for 20 years  or 16 years  or 14 years,  whatever it is.  We won't call you back.  You know, and...  McDonald's did it.  Could you do it?  Because if you two do it together,  that's the end.  You don't have any problems.  Everybody will have to follow you.  That'll be the industry.  So we'll have this kind of...  Negotiations that go down.  Or this much...  You know, whatever it is  that becomes the standard practice  because you're the leaders  and so they go after the leaders.  So they do have a certain amount  of common sense that they use  where they're willing to compromise.  When they're compromising, 
[02:01:30]  they have it all sorted out.  They've got to be realistic.  All the economics  that they show,  present a plan.  They go in with a reasonable plan.  They can't say,  from now on,  don't sell chicken.  Yeah, you don't say that chicken.  But that's the image  and the impression  that a lot of people get  is that it's just unreasonable.  Well, they've got an army  of people who are maybe unreasonable  in regards to someone else's business.  They say,  you are causing suffering  so much so  that the karma,  the planet,  everybody is being burned by you  and we hate you  and then they come in and say, 
[02:02:00]  let's move it one step at a time  and negotiate the deals.  So that's reasonable.  Have you been arrested?  Have you marched?  Because a lot of guys  will go out and march a little bit  and have you ever,  like Martin Sheen will go out  and chams off the trees.  I'm so embarrassed to say that.  I mean,  I'm not just an animal rights actor.  I have many causes  and things that I care about  but I've not been arrested.  I'm kind of embarrassed to say that.  That I've not broken my cherry  as a rubber shop.  You just broke your cherry,  boy,  you ain't done shit.  Do you want to be arrested  for one of these causes?  No. 
[02:02:30]  Fuck no.  Do I want to get arrested?  Obviously no.  But you would, though.  Yeah, I would.  It depends on which,  I mean, that depends.  Why do we jump past  the he's confused with pussy thing?  Well, I don't know.  We can get back to that.  I'm pleased.  The show is called  Running Russell Simmons  on Tuesday on Oxygen.  Tuesday is at 10 o'clock on Oxygen.  Yeah, the first show  we had 200 Victoria's Secret models  and they raised,  and some were at Sports Illustrated  and Victoria's Secret  and we raised $400,000  for building up.  Damn.  Yeah, it was Angels for Africa,  first show, 
[02:03:00]  and for Sarah Leong,  we built a maternity ward.  And second show,  we had Simone  did the animal rights protest,  and third show  is our annual Hamptons.  Like, tomorrow,  we'll have Amber Rose on there  and Reggie Bush,  a lot of people on the show.  Everybody from the Hugging Saint  to Courtney Love,  from T.I.  to Deepak Chopra,  from just Swiss Beats  and Alicia Keys  to, you know,  just so many different people  in the few episodes we shot.  Because people come through my office.  Interesting people come through my office. 
[02:03:30]  From the Hindus  to the Muslims  to the Jews  to the, you know,  just every kind of  interesting person  comes through my office.  I love that about my office.  Lots of diversity.  Do you, being in the position you're in,  it's like,  after a while  when you get girls,  you can pretty much bang  any kind of girl you want,  whatever you want.  Do you find yourself  bored with that  and, like,  looking for other stuff  to kind of be stimulated?  Because it is after a while.  You can get whatever you want.  Well, since I've been single,  I've had two very serious relationships.  One was short,  so it was three,  but one was short 
[02:04:00]  but it was really intense.  And then other than that,  I've been single.  So I've been single  for about a year now.  And it piles up,  it gets a little boring.  Yeah.  One after the other?  Yeah, but not one after the other,  but just the idea  that you find,  you know,  people,  sometimes guys  will go after a girl  because she's pretty  and fun a little bit,  but you really know  it's not your perfect match.  Where girls are busy sitting,  some girls are sitting  and looking for the perfect guy.  So they sit around.  Their single life  is less exciting  than a guy's life could be.  You know,  I operate on the 7th Avenue.  I meet beautiful women  all the time. 
[02:04:30]  And, you know,  and sometimes I go out  with girls who I know  I'm not going to marry.  Right?  You do that, right?  Yeah, everyone.  I've never even thought  of marrying one.  Exactly.  I'll be lucky  if they make it out of my car  without blowing me.  Well, there you have it.  So what do you look for?  Because after a while  you have to wonder,  like,  does this girl like me for me  or because I'm like,  what immediately makes you  say about a girl,  like,  ah,  I kind of like this girl.  I kind of like some girls  because they're pretty.  Honestly,  I mean,  I don't like fur,  you know,  wearing,  cigarette smoking. 
[02:05:00]  If I can help it,  I mean,  because they're not,  because you know  they're foreign,  I think,  you know,  from what you're thinking  and people who make fun  of your causes.  I like girls who are  interested in what I'm  interested in.  But I meet these girls  like,  I just came back  from Sierra Leone  and I studied in India  with Batabi Joyce  and I'm a great yogi,  vegan,  perfect,  and then Cocoa's from hell.  You know,  you never know  and people have read about you  and they tell you shit  but I don't know,  I like pretty girls  and sometimes I say, 
[02:05:30]  you know,  are you interested in this?  Really?  I know about that  and I talk about it  and I think,  that's not my favorite subject  but I'm on that subject.  She's real pretty,  so I'll give her some leeway.  So you're equally as guilty  as they are in some ways,  you know?  Who's a better bang,  the vegan who's into meditation  or the Cocoa?  Yogis are pretty freaky.  Oh, really?  Yeah,  yogis are like,  really,  yeah.  You know,  the story about Krishna and Radha,  you probably don't know this.  I know it,  but they don't.  No,  you don't.  You're a lion sack.  Radha was married  and Krishna and Radha 
[02:06:00]  carried on a very scandalous relationship.  He,  in fact,  he was married as well  and Krishna had many girls  and Radha was his favorite girl  and he and Radha,  their love was so inspired  that the whole kingdom  would like,  look at them  and many people  would be enlightened  just by seeing their love.  But,  you know,  Radha was still like,  you know,  and Krishna was still,  you know,  and I think they like,  they both like,  when I think they fucked  a part of the kingdom  between them.  Where were they?  Wait,  where were they?  A lot of Hindus  don't dispute that. 
[02:06:30]  Oh, Hindus,  okay.  But,  but it's just,  there's a deity,  well,  they actually lived according to,  and so Krishna and Radha  were kind of inspired,  right?  But they had the same struggle  and Lord Buddha said  right before enlightenment,  that was his last struggle.  Really?  Yeah.  That was his last struggle.  Yeah.  Like indiscriminate,  like,  you know,  sex,  right?  It's like a difficult,  but most,  you know,  people,  like,  you look at Solomon,  they got problems.  We got problems.  Yeah.  Right?  I really like Russell  because I know this is a guy  who likes to fuck,  and as,  this is what he's...  No,  but not only likes to fuck,  the idea that's just a man 
[02:07:00]  struggling,  they act like it's not,  and you know,  it is,  and it's not so puritanical  in my view anyway,  you know?  I'm less offended by,  you know,  someone who wants to have sex  than I am by somebody  who wants to destroy the planet  by,  you know,  contributing to so much  crazy behavior.  I'm really concerned  that 10 billion suffering  farm animals,  you must think that  there's some karma  attached to that.  I think when you know it,  you must think so.  You know,  when you realize what it is,  you must think that...  Why do they make steaks  so delicious then?  God damn it.  It's just wonderful. 
[02:07:30]  Wow,  Russell just gave you a...  No,  I don't know.  It's true.  It's delicious.  How long did you eat meat for?  Up until,  I don't know,  until 13 years ago.  Okay.  Did you like it?  Huh?  Did you think it was delicious?  It was fine.  I ate pig feet.  Really?  Yeah,  but I feel better now.  Yeah.  I'm much healthier now.  Oh,  yeah,  yeah.  My nutritious looks at me,  he's like,  when are you going to eat some fish or something?  You need some fish oil.  I said,  but you just checked my hair  and my DNA and everything.  Am I missing anything?  He said,  no,  you're not missing anything  for 53 years old. 
[02:08:00]  You're okay.  You know,  so I'm okay.  All right.  You know what I mean?  I wouldn't,  you know,  eat meat every day.  That's for sure.  You know,  moderation.  Yeah.  But I understand.  I've been out with it.  He's laughing at your moderation.  Moderation.  That's a good rap.  People say that shit all the time.  It's not good.  No,  I mean like red meat.  Anyway.  Not judgment.  Being happy is the most.  I'll eat chicken like a motherfucker.  If it's health issues  we're talking about,  50% of that shit's  got to be just happiness.  I think your endorphins  that come out  are anti-inflammatory 
[02:08:30]  or inflat,  depending on where your brain is.  And I think maybe 25%  of it could be diet  and 25% of it's good  to work out circulation.  That's a good mix.  How good is yoga  for losing weight?  Because I took,  I tried Bikram twice  and I almost had a stroke.  Smoke.  Well,  where I go,  they never talk yoga.  Yoga is a whole eight steps  and in the eight steps,  I mean the classic yoga  they refer to as eight steps.  You know,  there are seven steps  that are not about  the physical practice.  But the idea  of the physical practice  is you smile and breathe 
[02:09:00]  in every difficult pose.  Right?  And you take that  with you in life.  So it's good.  That's the physical  practice of yoga.  But when you do it  and it's an aggressive class  like a Bikram class  but not Bikram,  somewhere where it's really yoga  and you do it as practice  and you sweat  and then you're with these people  and they're all dedicated  and they're all vegan  and then you,  you know,  you start to take care  of your temple more  because it becomes,  it gets in you,  you know,  people around you  and it becomes a culture  and you start making choices.  I just want to lose  my stomach in man tits  and I don't feel 
[02:09:30]  like lifting weights.  You can lose  in man tits  and other shit  but yoga does help.  It does, right?  You can lose a lot of weight.  Of course you can.  How long is your class  each one you go to?  An hour and a half.  Wow.  I like it.  An hour.  If Bikram was an hour  I never would have stopped going  but it was that last 30 minutes  that just fucking,  that's the idea.  Yeah, that's where,  the last 30 minutes.  But I wasn't in good shape  for the first hour either.  I wasn't cruising along.  I was near death  and that last half hour  just made me go,  just I want to fucking go home.  But you jumped right in.  You should have taken  a beginner class or something.  It was humiliating.  All these fucking 90 pound girls  with camel toe in front of me 
[02:10:00]  and I'm just sitting there  like a fat lump.  That's the best.  That's how I started.  It was all girls with me.  I couldn't touch my toes.  I was in class.  It was all hot girls.  This was 15 years ago.  There was no guys.  Right.  Maybe one gay guy.  Right.  And you and 50 girls.  Damn.  It was hot.  How great are yoga outfits though?  They're always tight  and they just cling to the crotch.  What's better than a girl  in yoga pants?  Yoga pants.  Women should be forced  to wear yoga pants  to work every day  no matter what they do  for a living.  Female cops. 
[02:10:30]  Nuns.  Yoga pants rule.  Jesus Christ.  You're talking about  the work you've done  in Sierra Leone.  What do you attribute  the problem  and I know it's  sort of not an easily  answered question  but the problem  with Africa  where so much help  is needed.  I was in London  last week  and we raised  a million dollars  for Diamond Empowerment Fund  and what we do there  we have a school in Africa  where kids  some of the kids  are meditators there 
[02:11:00]  and it's Cedar Institute  and Cedar Institute  is a free college  it's impossible  to get in that school.  It's a free college  but you know  and the funnel  people who can get  in that school  versus people  who need education  it's almost like  the new problem  in America.  They think it's funny  that no one gets educated  and everybody's dumb as shit  this is a problem.  I don't know  how we think  we're going to be  competitive on the  world economy  without educating our kids  so that's the problem  lack of education 
[02:11:30]  and opportunity.  It's lack of education  how come that hasn't  just  there's so much  infighting  in  well we create  a lot of the infighting  you know  when somebody has some shit  like you got some oil  we're going to create a fight  you ain't going to  fuck a hole on the oil  if you have diamonds  I mean until recently  you know  now  I work  in some ways  in defense of the diamond industry  I run this jewelry company  and I got  I created this diamond  empowerment fund  and I looked into  I met with President Mandela  I met with President Mahai  and President Mbeki 
[02:12:00]  and we talked about  the diamond industry  and really  it's a great benefit  to the countries  that have it  and have decent deals  and there's a lot more  accountability now  it's a lot more  accountability  but the rest of the industries  extractive industries  are pretty bad  and all of them  you know  if there's something  you find some shit  in your country  and you ain't got  a big military  or you don't have  a strong ass government  you're going to be  destabilized  if you look through Africa  and you find  you look  wherever  there's great resources  there's great instability  and not because 
[02:12:30]  the people are fighting  over it  but yet  the people are  motivated by  different corporations  people  countries  that would like  to participate  in their shit  it's their shit  but they can't  benefit from it  I understand  that part of it  but it confuses me  things like  warlords  taking food away  from the people  that  aid that comes in  aid that comes in  and it's like  you're killing  your own people  you know  but you have to 
[02:13:00]  look at it this way  if you start  with the premise  that people are  all the same  and have the same  aspirations  the same needs  wants  same everything  same everything  and you put them  all over the world  you know  these same people  had the potential  to create  and they all do  create beautiful  religions  with the exact  same principles  and then you see  places where  they survive  you know  and places where  they don't  you know  it has to do  with the freedom  that you give to them  and the lack  of them  you cannot 
[02:13:30]  you cannot deny  people freedom  and expect  them to flourish  right  right  and so  when people  you know  it's always  a result  of karma  and always  a result  of cause  and effect  and always  a result  so it's never  so why can't  they do it  well they have  something you have  they don't have  in some cases  you know  and I can't imagine  what cases  that you can get  away with some shit  because you're  smarter or you're  better  no one's better  you know  so they all 
[02:14:00]  I just  I kind of give  people the benefit  of doubt  I know  that when people  are suffering  there's something  wrong  you know  why can't  these kids  get educated  well you know  I don't know  let's  can we give  them a school  that's  that's better  than their home  and they go  to school  and they feel  happy  and they learn  or can we  what are we  doing  that to help  relieve their  suffering  is the only  question I ask  I would be  out of my mind  if I thought  like that  like you  you are  a very generous  guy  it's amazing  that you could  see these problems  and actually go 
[02:14:30]  I'm gonna do  something about that  like it's beyond  me  it seems  like it would  make you feel  good to do  them  but to me  it seems like  the stress  of having to  actually figure  out how to do  it  would be  overwhelming  no man  it's no stress  it's stress  if you create it  I think the world  you know  as a servant  it doesn't matter  where you are  where you come in  you know  it's very relative  now what do you  consider you a  servant of 
[02:15:00]  like what  what would you  consider yourself  serving  well you know  if I was a  religious guy  which I'm not  obviously I figured  out you're not  a religious guy  but you did  say servant  I would say God  and if God  was like the big  ocean right  and you were  a cup of God  serve yourself  okay  that makes sense  so if you're  connected  if you believe  that you were  connected  to the animals  connected to the  environment  connected to other  people  then when you  go to work  to serve  you'd feel  comfortable  serving  so you're 
[02:15:30]  serving  the collective  which in turn  helps you  that's also  not sweating  the results  too is what  helps you do  it  I'm saying  this just  because I  know other  people who  do it  I'm a  self-centered  ass  of course  you are  but when  you don't  sweat  the results  you just  give and  you don't  panic about  what's going  to happen  it's not  stressful  it's a yoga  principle  obviously  not only a  yoga principle  it's a Christian  it's a Jewish  it's a Muslim  principle  it's a basic  principle  and that's  where he gets  his pleasure  but we're  very jaded  and it's  very hard  to accept  and believe  that people  are doing  something  just 
[02:16:00]  because it's  good  you know  you remember  the Magnificent  Seven when  Holmes was  getting ready  to get it  he already  got shot  he was laying  he was going  to die  and he says  why are we  back here  and he just  looked and he  said for the  gold  you stupid  motherfucker  just died  just fucking  died  for the gold  I had a friend  ask me  what on charities  you run  what's the  angle  you gotta be  asked that  a lot  what's your  angle  what's this  guy  looking into  it  he's gotta  have something  running here  it's not the  specific best route 
[02:16:30]  to new pussy  it's just not  there's other  shit you can do  I don't know  schools in Sierra Leone  are not the way  to meet chicks  I would guess so  unless there's  a bunch of  the schools  in South Africa  Sierra Leone  is maternity ward  so anyway  it's just  you do it  for fun  right  I guess so  I guess  it's not that  big a deal  you could do it  and you do it  now  you like making  people happy  I do like  making people  happy  and if it's  sitting on my  couch watching 
[02:17:00]  television  they're happy  I'm a lazy  bum  Russell  what else  well you only  have a couple  minutes left  so we should  promote the show  yeah the show  running Russell  Simmons  I said too much  about the purpose  of the show  but on top of  that we have  these two interns  they're a lot  of fun  and a lot  of fun shit  we're on  7th Avenue  again I'm a  yogi not a  priest  the most  beautiful woman  you've ever  seen  the most  fun  interesting  stories  I mean  and I  think that  it's not  like most  reality  like last 
[02:17:30]  week for  instance  one of the  assistants  flashed her  pussy at  TI  that was  supposed to  be a big  deal  everybody  that was  one of the  things that  girls CNN  objected to  but it was  a Sharon  Stone moment  and when  they dragged  her in the  office  when they  drag her in  the office  she said  oh my god  was it a  Britney moment  and then I  realized the  generation gap  it was a  Britney moment  you think  Sharon Stone  she thinks  Britney right  right  and then  little funny  stuff happens  throughout  and lots  of parties  and lots  of interesting  people and  it's really a  different show  than you see 
[02:18:00]  and it's not  I didn't want  to have talking  heads  telling the story  because I  didn't want to  stop and see  reality  because once I  see reality  I turn  but you know  I lost that  battle  and the  network and  I have  fought about  little things  but the  creative  aggravation  between all  of it  has turned  out good  and the  show is  very funny  and very  interesting  what did  T.I. do  when the  girl flashed  him  that's a  rapper who  gets a lot  of ass  you gotta be  smart  if you act  like it's 
[02:18:30]  not interesting  to you  that draws  more women  in  that was a  funny moment  but that was  last week  this week  Amber Rose  stays at  my house  globalgrind.com  is my  venture  and the  women from  globalgrind  come in my  office and  they ask me  how to build  a celebrity  channel and  I said Amber  was the most  trending celebrity  on our network  so we brought  her in and  took her to  my house  and we had  this big  party which  I have a  4th of July  party every  year and  it was there  and lots of  celebrities came  to the party  and Amber  was kind of  an interesting 
[02:19:00]  she's crazy  as shit  she needs a  show of  our own  yeah  she's fun  spin off  yeah  who else  is there  my kids  Reverend Run  is on this  show this  week  his kids  are on  the show  this week  it's a whole  bunch of  beautiful girls  and fun  people  and hip hop  Nick Cannon  is on the  show this  week  Reggie Bush  is on the  show this  week  I have a  great idea  for an  episode  if you  haven't  shot them  all  I can't  help my  friend  as a  charitable  thing  you know  a comedian  who's never  had a  threesome  with two  hot chicks  and you  try to make  that happen  and if the  two girls  can get through 
[02:19:30]  it without  vomiting  you give  them a  prize  JB Smoove  was on  the show  of course  he's a  comedian  I know  he's my  friend  but I was  hoping to  get myself  some ass  are you  kidding me  you can't  get ass  I get  radio ass  I don't get  Russell Simmons  ass  there's a  different level  of ass  I get  I really  appreciate  you guys  having me  on  I hope  they don't  get in 
[02:20:00]  trouble  for using  real language  our intentions  aren't that  bad  we're not  that fucked  up  in our heads  we like  real language  running  Russell Simmons  Tuesdays at  10pm on  Oxygen  check it out  man  thank you  Russell  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  there are  whispers  between  the screens  that this  thing can  be done  even 
[02:20:30]  sinners  must  dream  and I  can be  the one  to make  the devil  cry  fucking  phenomenal  I don't know  that one  that's the  heaven and  hell  newer one  they put  out  I believe  on the  album  bible  black  little  deal  great  man  that's  recent  sounding  good  not too  recent  well yeah  not since 
[02:21:00]  he died  well  hey  so back  to Stevie  thanks for  adding that  not since  he died  never would  have known  he died  he died  he died  oh  literal  and  back to  Stevie  so  what  happened  a little  prank  went bad  on Friday  Stevie  thought it  would be  a funny  thing  to  take  Dirk's  credit card  I don't  not giving  it back  for  for Wendy's  run  or something  and then  not give  the card  back  and he  thought  that would  be a funny  prank  Dirk lost  his fucking  mind  and basically  wants Stevie  fired from his 
[02:21:30]  free internship  because he was then  without his credit card  for the weekend  which is  you don't want that  of course not  it's really more  than just the  action  I mean the  action itself  is bad  but it's like  there's just been  a pattern  of Stevie  being terrible  he doesn't know  how to joke  no  the big difference  between Stevie  and other interns  that have been  similar to Stevie  is that  they know  when to just  stop  and it's over  now  and Stevie  doesn't know  why are you  giving Stevie  real things 
[02:22:00]  to do  though  why would  Derek  trust him  with a credit  card  it's not  even that  it's like  what gets  them  upset  and Danny  has sat him  down  and looked  him dead  in the face  and he has  said  what makes  you different  from everybody  else  is Bobo  intern David  I can look  at them  and say  shut the  fuck up  and you know  what they do  they shut  the fuck up  you never  shut the  fuck up  I don't know  let's try it  you've seen him  we sit there  and try to  talk to him 
[02:22:30]  I just realized  I'm sitting here  trying to wave him  in and I'm like  he can't see  what I'm doing  blind Stevie  how much  long are you  with us  by the way  to the summer  well  that's also  a point of  contention  because I've  been behind  team  let's get  Stevie  another semester  and I am  alone on  that team  I'm all in  I'm all in  you don't have to  deal with that  I'm all in  I'm all in  Stevie  shut the fuck  up  that doesn't 
[02:23:00]  happen with us  gotta get the  last word  wait how does  that happen  I mean  well he's not  going to give you  are you sorry  as far as the  Derek thing goes  yeah I mean  I really wasn't  trying to cause  any trouble  honestly  you were though  yeah  not in like  a serious  kind of way  why didn't you  get to the  train station  in a half  hour  like you  asked  because  you know  it's a long  way for me  you know  it's not a long  way for you  it's the same  distance as  everybody else  you had a  half hour  to get to  Penn Station  what did you  do  oh shit  alrighty guys

[02:25:00]  Steve  you ever  hear  you ever  hear  of the  expression  out of  sight  out of  mind  yes  you should  probably  figure out  what that  means  I know  what that  means  really  that slamming  sound  was  Derek  slamming  his hand  down  on the  desk  and just  looking at  Stevie  like  what the  fuck  are you  still  doing  here  why  wouldn't  you  leave  I mean  I was  trying to  leave  but then  Travis  kept calling  me back 
[02:25:30]  he goes  Stevie  and he  goes  motions  with his  hand  and come  back  in  of course  Derek  goes  no  get out  what are you  just doing  an impression  of fucking  Derek  no I'll just  say you know  he was very  mad  just saying  what he  said  Stevie  doesn't do  anything  unless Sam  tells him  it's okay  to  so Derek  is going  Stevie  get the  fuck  out of  my  face  leave  Stevie  I don't  want to  look at  you  Stevie  and then  Stevie  will just  stand  there  and look  to Sam  what do  I do  it's almost 
[02:26:00]  like Simon  says  Sam  says  that's it  what are you  guys fisting  up top  Stevie's all  happy now  he's smiling  we pounded  it out  do you  understand  he doesn't  get  that you're  on the  thinnest  fucking ice  Derek  has a lot  of fucking  clout  with this  show  he just  threw his  hands up  Derek  game  up  do you  know  he's not  just some  fucking  like  sound 
[02:26:30]  guy  that he  has a lot  of clout  with this  show  and a lot  of history  and he's been  with this  show for  many years  and done  amazing work  and you've done  nothing  he's got a lot  of respect  a lot  of respect  for him  he took  his credit  card  how long  were you  out  without your  credit card  all weekend  holy shit  all weekend  because you  thought you'd  make a ha ha  it backfired  obviously  so why don't  you go and  find where he  lives and give  it to him  yeah it was  your responsibility 
[02:27:00]  why did he  have to go  the whole  weekend  when did  you get  it back  today  yeah today  holy shit  well I gave  it back  to eroc  because eroc  said he  would lock  it in his  desk  so  whatever  it wasn't  in derrick's  pocket  why wouldn't  you go  to his  house  I don't  know  I think  because he  lives in  like jersey  or something  oh god  forbid you  go to jersey  after you  fucked up  I think  you could  book a  flight  you fucked  up  so you  shouldn't  have to  it's  jersey  exactly  your prank  backfire  I don't  think he  wants me  knowing where  he lives  anyway  no I  don't  look at  his  why did 
[02:27:30]  it take  you a half  an hour  to get  to Penn  Station  why  why  it's 15  blocks  so what  did you  do  it was  it was  there and  back  I ran  as fast  as I  could  and then  I went  I was  looking for  him  why did  you hop  on the  train  subway  oh  take a  fucking  cab  mom won't  let him  do the  subway  how about  this  at your age  instead of  listening to  mommy  how about  you worry  about getting  the guy's  credit card  that you  fucking  had for  the  weekend  do you 
[02:28:00]  understand  how inconvenient  it is  for a guy  in manhattan  to not be  allowed to  use the  subway  that's the  way people  get around  when they  have a car  and then  his  excuse is  he goes  well  my mom  doesn't want  me to  get raped  and it's  like stevie  no one's  raping you  she almost  did by  troy  and what do  you mean  you didn't  have any  money  you had  Derek's  credit card  but I  didn't  want to  use it  just because  mommy  doesn't  let you  how old  are you  19  mommy has  no say  in whether  or not  you ride  the subway  mommy has 
[02:28:30]  no say  in whether  you're old  enough to  go to the  electric chair  for real  you're old  enough to  join the  military  your mother  has no  legal  power over  you  you know  what we're  going to do  we're going to  send him  uptown  on the subway  oh no  we're going to  send you on a  mission  where you  have to  bring something  back from  a restaurant  like a  napkin  or a thing  from that  soul food  place  Kennedy fried  chicken  juniors  juniors  kennedy fried  kennedy fried  chicken  we want a 
[02:29:00]  menu  from kennedy's  fried chicken  and you have  to take the  subway uptown  to get it  I think he  should make  at least one  transfer  what's that  he should  make at least  one transfer  and a transfer  right right  and we should  go pee diddy  on this  and make him  bring us  back a piece  of cheesecake  from juniors  cheesecake  from juniors  cheesecake  from juniors  that's what  he did  I'm making  the band  what's the  famous  soul food  place up  there  that everybody  goes to  Sylvia's  Sylvia's

[02:47:00]  and he just doesn't  and he fucking exaggerates shit on purpose too  i know  it took him half an hour  to tie his fucking shoes the other day  like relace his shoes  and he did it backwards  he did it from the bottom up  you were looking at me  on me the whole time  i'm not about to tie and pee  yeah right  how's he supposed to do that  derrick i think  i think stevie  you only have one more shot at this  don't you hate watching his lips move  when he talks  yeah and he cuts himself shaving  all the fucking time  and he's got these necks on top  where does he shave  look at his upper lip  upper lip 
[02:47:30]  you don't like his lips yet  no they're like larry sanders  they really are  Gary Shandling lips  he just was never  his mom never brought him in  for the diagnosis  go ahead what's the matter  juicy lips  he's got this thing  stevie maybe if you start crying  show us some emotion  no  it's  perfect  fucking rock  I don't know what else  you can't do anything  you can turn in your key card  in your fucking building id  and just go home  he wants nothing more  for me to be gone  yes because you don't do 
[02:48:00]  anything around here  we don't need you  I do  I told you  I've done plenty of things  you're fired  everybody wants you gone  you can't speak for everyone  except sam  sam's the only one  you don't want to go  you don't want to go  I want you gone too  you want him to stay  I want him to stay very much  and get another semester  thank you sam  appreciate it  well he can work on your show  on saturday then  he's always welcome  he's been here before  but I don't want him around me  like I don't want him  anywhere near me  do you know you're just  you pretty much fuck up  everything you do  he fucks up everything  it's not pretty much 
[02:48:30]  it's everything  I realized the other day  when I sent him out  for the video game  that we gave him  much too much information  it should have just been  hey  get me this game  and send him out  but we gave him  much too much information  a time limit  like all this shit  it should have just been  let's just send him out  and see if he can do this  because I don't think  he would have been able to  but if I screwed that up  he called his mommy  he called another intern  I was being resourceful  and if I had screwed that up  you wouldn't even have  that game at all  you wouldn't be playing  you wouldn't be playing 
[02:49:00]  that game on the first day  being awful  yeah yeah  I wouldn't get it myself  stevie's not allowed  to get food or breakfast  for anybody  at least for me  he wrote something  he wrote exactly  what he fucking wanted  on a piece of paper  and he still fucked it up  yeah  I know what stevie's  track record is  so you know me  and travis  were deciding  what we were  going to eat  for lunchy poo  and I just knew  that he was going to  fuck up  and I didn't even want  to give him the chance  of writing it down  to fuck it up himself  so I wrote it down  verbatim  like all you have to do  is read that 
[02:49:30]  read the words  so he goes down  to where we were  getting lunch  and apparently  he was taking too long  because he's blind  and he can't read  and the guy just took  the fucking paper  out of his hand  like he's going to  help the retarded  so he didn't bother  to like you know  pay attention  see what the guy  was doing  so he just like  sat down  and waited for the food  to be done  so of course  it was fucked up  too  it was fucked up  Stevie are you willing  to do anything  to maybe get  you know  back your relationship  with Derek  you know  I'm just asking  anything  well I mean  I got an idea  I got an idea  you see this long hallway 
[02:50:00]  you see this long hallway  I want you to run  full speed  run into the window  like you're a bird  can you do that Stevie  um  alright  go right through it  I don't  yeah I don't know  if that's a good idea  you know  I break something  well I guess  you don't really  care about Derek  no I do  but I mean  I gave you  I gave you an opportunity  I might get killed  Opie  I mean  I would rather  he do this  I would rather  we put him out there 
[02:50:30]  we spin him around  and around  and around  and make him walk  down the hallway  without his glasses  without his glasses on  all spun around  dizzy  is that something  if it gets Derek  to forgive me  and just you know  sure  act normal for me  sure  sure  okay  you know  they do that  at like sporting events  you know  yeah yeah yeah  that's not a bad idea  alright let's do it  here we go  alright  they're taking him out  in the hallway  so what are we doing  spin this motherfucker  around and around  you gotta like 
[02:51:00]  spin around in circles  a lot  and then take his glasses off  and make him run down  the hallway  run down the hallway  yeah  run down the hallway  that way  and keep going  go go go  keep going  alright  we should have him run  друзья  spinning spinning  keep going  keep going  spin spin  go go go  keep going  keep going  keep going  keep going  keep going  keep going  keep going  spin spin  spin  spin  hard 
[02:51:30]  faster  you fuck  god  you fat lump of shit  alright  now run  run  run  Let him walk.  He's running perfectly normal.  Because he didn't spin good enough.  Because he's fat and dumb.  He just ran perfectly normal after that.  He doesn't know how to spin, though.  He was like, he couldn't even spin around right.  He's incapable of the simplest things.  He really is.  And somebody gave him the talk, too, when he was younger.  He says, like, he's special. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah, he's fucking, he deserves to be treated with respect and all this dignity and shit.  I think he can't get dizzy because, like, he just doesn't see anything ever.  So what's the difference, how fast he's not seeing anything?  How did he not get dizzy?  I know he didn't spin properly, but he spun enough.  He wasn't spinning right.  Were you dizzy?  I'm still dizzy.  You're not dizzy.  You ran a perfect line.  You didn't spin right.  No, I actually ran diagonally.  I almost crashed into the wall, but then I...  You could correct all of that.  Look how out of breath you are.  How old are you?  Nineteen.  Nineteen.  He eats fast food every day.  I know. 
[02:52:30]  I have a lot of it, too.  I have a 12-minute video on my phone of me discreetly filming him eat his lunch one day.  Is it amazing?  You ought to do a little time lapse.  Yeah, because he ate so...  He ate...  That'd be great.  He ate, like, four burgers, and then he, like, went in for, like, the snack wraps.  Yeah, and then he had some chicken sandwiches.  Oh, my God.  He's proud of it.  He's proud of how shitty he eats.  You're going to become obese and just be a burger.  Why is everyone mad at this kid?  Because he's a lump.  Yeah.  He's easy to hate.  Like, private pile.  You're like, private fucking pile.  What did you say, Sam?  Everyone hates him.  I'm not mad at him.  I just wanted to make sure.  Because he said everybody. 
[02:53:00]  You'll be the one fucking hitting him with the bars of soap and the pillowcase.  Oh, he's the fucking worst.  Believe me.  All right, well, we should tell you, buddy.  Then as he's crying, Sam's fucking got his hands over his ears.  Doesn't want to hear fat boy cry.  I know.  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  I don't know how he ran perfectly straight.  I don't get it.  That's weird.  All right, Derek and Stevie, they look like they're mending their problems. 
[02:53:30]  That's good.  Oh, yes.  Absolutely.  Really good news.  Are we still going to send them uptown to get a menu or something?  Yeah, yeah.  Not today, obviously, but we've got to send them on the subway.  Because mommy says he can't go.  So we're going to send them to the most treacherous areas via subway.  Maybe we can give them, like, the entire show on Wednesday.  Yeah, we'll do something like that.  That's a good idea.  The whole show, you're getting on a fucking subway.  I think once 20...  Oh, he'll be here tomorrow.  Good.  Oh, and by the way, we should start real early when it's still a little dark.  Sure.  Good idea.  Very nice reason. 
[02:54:00]  And we'll send them out uptown.  You're going uptown, motherfucker.  Am I going alone?  Yeah.  Oh, yes.  All alone.  Hey, very good idea coming in.  Can we put them in the spinning chair of death and have them do the same exact thing?  Oh, spinning chair?  Oh, so you put them in a chair?  Physically, can we?  Yeah.  Absolutely.  All right.  Oh, so that chair?  And then spin them around.  That way it's not a problem with the idiot not being able to spin because the center of gravity  is...  Yeah, very good idea.  So we're going to put you in the...  Like a Buick.  We're going to put you in the spinning chair of death.  I'm going to think of something heavy.  And then make him open up his own fucking... 
[02:54:30]  Make him open up the studio door and run down the hall.  Yeah.  Can we just have him walk?  What if he runs into something?  Eh, I can't.  You laugh.  All right, here's the spinning...  I say he walks.  Here's the spinning wheel.  Your legs are in, you fucking retard.  You can't even spin properly.  As a matter of fact, walk will be easier because...  I mean, walk will be harder.  I think the running gave him too much momentum.  Yeah.  Well, he's getting caught up in the mic cable.  You can't have him run through glass.  Let him walk.  He's so heavy. 
[02:55:00]  He's so heavy.  They're having a tough time spinning.  Come on, spin him, spin him.  He's spinning Jupiter.  Yeah, really, he's building mass.  All right, they're spinning him pretty good.  You are a waste.  They can't even...  I like the music, though.  That's pretty good.  Are you going to throw up?  I hope he pukes.  Do you know how many fucking bad calories and dumb food would fall out?  Oh, I know.  License.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Now we're spinning him pretty good. 
[02:55:30]  Keep going.  All right, now we got him good.  All right.  He's still spinning into my chair.  Yeah.  All right.  Get up.  Oh, my God.  All right.  I know it's my fault.  All right.  Is he ready?  All right.  Now get up and just walk.  Okay.  Just walk.  And if you're feeling it, you can run.  That's up to you.  No, running gets him momentum.  Walk.  Make him walk.  I don't want him running through a wall.  Just walk.  There you go.  And walk down the hall.  A little faster than that, you fat lump of shit.  Okay. 
[02:56:00]  Okay.  The Opian Anthony Show on the virus.  Series XM.  I'd rather be with, I'd rather be with, I'd rather be with, I'd rather be with, I'd rather be with, I'd rather be with.  Oh, I didn't even know we were on yet. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah, I was just listening to the Pearl Jam.  Loving the Pearl Jam channel.  I don't know when that goes away.  I would imagine it's going to go away soon.  That sucks.  Right when you just really, really start liking it, it'll go away.  Yeah.  That's how things work.  I love it, actually.  It'll be gone in no time.  I've heard it's going to be on a lot longer than I thought.  How long?  How long?  I've heard rumors that it'll be around for a year.  I've heard rumors.  You're straight.  Well, that is actually a fact.  Oh.  Are they still touring, though, or no? 
[02:57:00]  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Are they doing Poughkeepsie this weekend?  I don't think they are, no.  Oh, because I'll be there.  That's not about me.  I'll be at Bananas Friday, Saturday.  I said maybe they're going to be doing it with me.  I don't know.  Really?  And there's some huge Atlantic City show announcement I have tomorrow.  It's me and a couple of comedians.  It actually is a fucking phenomenal show.  It goes on sale Friday.  It will sell out.  And I'm allowed to announce it tomorrow.  I can't wait.  Can you write down the other comedians?  I want to know. 
[02:57:30]  Just say it's me.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  It's a good show.  Yeah, that is going to fucking sell out.  Holy shit.  That's a good show, right?  That's a strong show.  Yeah, it's a very strong show.  Holy shit.  Well, it's not worth that.  No, that's pretty big.  Is there a name attached to it?  Yeah, but I can say it tomorrow.  They didn't name it, but again, just because it's...  That is a...  I got to go to that.  Yeah, I'm happy with that one a lot.  We got everybody we wanted on the show. 
[02:58:00]  That's who we wanted, and that was who we got.  What theater?  I don't know, actually.  I don't know.  It better be a big one.  Possibly, yeah.  I just don't know.  Possibly.  Absolutely.  I hope so.  We know it's going to sell out.  We just don't know when.  That's strong.  What day?  All tomorrow?  All right.  Yeah, I'll announce tomorrow.  We'll have it for tomorrow.  I actually don't know the exact day.  I'll have it tomorrow.  I don't have the paper in front of me.  I only know the comedians.  No, that's great.  That's awesome.  You should see the artwork we have for it.  Just the poster is okay.  You should see what they proposed to make the fucking poster. 
[02:58:30]  Can you show us tomorrow?  I almost fired my agent.  Really?  No, it's not bad.  I might get fucking terrible.  Yeah, bad.  I was screaming at him in L.A.  Embarrassing?  Humiliating for everybody.  Humiliating.  You'll tell us tomorrow?  Yeah, it's stuck.  Oh, good.  I love that.  We'll fill in all the blanks tomorrow.  No problem.  Hey, Billy Ray Cyrus.  None of us really give a shit about Billy Ray Cyrus.  No, we care about his daughter.  But he's getting a divorce.  There was a rumor that Bret Michaels was having sex with his wife. 
[02:59:00]  I don't know if those rumors are true or not.  What?  I think Bret Michaels is denying that.  Because Bret Michaels worked on a song with Miley Cyrus, right?  Right.  So he got to know the family a little bit.  And then there was a rumor that there was an affair going on with the missus there.  And it led to this big divorce that's going down.  I don't know what's true in there.  Yeah, who knows?  But that's what some of the people are saying out there.  And Billy Ray was on this show called Woody and the Wake-Up Call.  And, well, let's just play this. 
[02:59:30]  This is what happened.  But I have to ask you, because you are a celebrity and we have all heard.  Yeah.  Your marriage is going...  Oh, man.  You know what, bud?  I'm sorry.  Woody Johnson.  I had to ask you.  Woody Johnson.  Yes, sir.  God bless America.  God bless our troops.  Woody Johnson.  Yes, sir.  Look at you.  Don't be mad at me.  Oh, I'm mad at you.  Have a good day, brother.  Are you done now?  Are you done?  See you, man.  All right. 
[03:00:00]  I had to ask, Billy.  Very rude.  I'm sorry I had to ask.  I won't talk to you again.  I'm sorry.  Ooh.  What a baby.  He doesn't want to hang out and answer that question.  There's a better way to handle it than that.  Like, to walk off like a baby is, especially if the guy isn't being a dick.  Like, if the guy's pushing you on something you don't want to talk about, then you can  walk out.  But it's like, what do you think makes you interesting at this point? 
[03:00:30]  Do you think it's Billy Ray Cyrus?  Exactly.  But it's your family.  Do you think at this point people are still talking about achy, breaky heart?  They don't give a fuck about you other than the fact that you care about your daughter  and the fact that you're getting a divorce right now.  So why not talk about it and go, I can't get into that right now?  Don't storm out.  That's why I fucking hate celebrities slash love them.  He didn't want any part of that.  Damn.  The Woody guy seemed a little sneaky with it.  He was mad. 
[03:01:00]  No, because the Woody guy wasn't belligerent about it.  He goes, I have to ask you.  You're a celebrity.  I don't know.  You should have started his interview with that.  The whole thing with I had to ask you.  He seems like a cop-out.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  Like, you don't have to ask a motherfucker anything.  He was just scared, dude.  He was trying to soften the blow a little bit.  He was nervous.  He was going to get yelled.  You know, he didn't want the guy to walk out.  That's obviously a big guess for that show.  He was scared he was going to get punched in the face.  I'd love Billy Ray to hit me.  I'd sue his daughter.  You could have said something like, you know, hey, I know it's a touchy subject, 
[03:01:30]  so if you want to answer it or not, a few questions about your marriage.  And if he goes, no, I don't want to talk about that.  And then you go, okay, cool.  That's kind of what he did.  He just didn't do it 100%.  No, he said, I hear your marriage is, like, over.  Oh, going down the tubes?  Like, yeah, yeah.  The way he worded it, there's a better way to fucking do that.  But if Billy Ray had one ounce of personality, he would have said, is that how you, the best  you could word that?  Well, the other thing is.  I fucking hate celebrities.  If Billy Ray's going to be out there, you've got to think that he's going to be asked that  question. 
[03:02:00]  What are you doing interviews for then?  Yeah, then you've got to not do the interviews.  Exactly.  Right?  I hate when publicists tell us, look, you could talk to a certain person, but you can't mention  this one thing.  I would say, do you have something your daughter sat on so I could smell it?  Give you a slap?  You think he'd walk out at that?  Yeah, but that would be a punch in the face.  Oh, you think so?  So, yeah.  He'd laugh.  Yeah.  My fingers.  What happened?  Jimmy had a bomb.  Jimmy doesn't bomb on the show ever. 
[03:02:30]  At a boil.  Ever.  What was the bomb?  I didn't hear a big guest for that show.  You were scared he was going to get punched in the face.  I'd love Billy Ray to hit me.  I'd sue his daughter.  You could say...  You could...  Oh, oh, hey.  I kind of like that line.  Not in the moment, you didn't.  What, in hindsight?  I don't have to react to everything.  It's not a bad line.  What's wrong with that line?  Apparently everything was.  You probably should have acknowledged it.  That's okay.  Maybe we should acknowledge it.  It was a monumental. 
[03:03:00]  I'd love Billy Ray to hit me.  I'd sue his daughter.  What?  What happened?  He was just listening for the love, apparently, that someone had for that line.  Now it's funny.  I just love when Jim bombs and he looks at me and I just...  Oof.  I knew it was a bomb, though.  I was like, oh.  Hey, what's the honest woman on the street interview, Danny?  Oh, it's a short one.  Somebody...  I don't know when it's from, but the TV reporter was on scene at an airport asking somebody about their travels. 
[03:03:30]  Here's a lady who's just asking questions.  Ma'am, mind if we get a quick comment from you on...  We're live on Channel 8 News.  How's your flight day going?  Shitty.  Okay, well...  Sorry to hear you.  A second night.  Here's a lady who's just asking questions.  Ma'am, mind if we get a quick comment from you on...  We're live on Channel 8 News.  How's your flight day going?  Shitty.  Okay, well...  Sorry to hear you say that. 
[03:04:00]  Okay, well...  It was very, very frustrating.  How is the news not in trouble for that, though?  Like, why are they not responsible for that?  I don't know.  They're ratings-driven.  Of course.  Of course.  They have different rules.  Shitty.  Did she just not understand the rules or not care?  We didn't get to the post guy taping that lady.  What?  What post guy?  Oh...  Holy shit, that video was everywhere Friday.  And we had it, but we ran out of time.  What video?  We were doing the Bobo thing.  There's a video going around of a black mail carrier 
[03:04:30]  arguing with an older white woman about a disagreement.  Who taped it?  The mail carrier.  Okay.  Followed the guy in a bunch of men.  Ma'am.  I guess she wanted a letter or a package or something.  She gave them back for whatever reason.  Yeah, I think it's confusing.  I think the wrong letter was delivered.  She said it wasn't the right person, gave it back,  and then decided that she wanted it back.  But now, with the mailman knowing that it's not for her, 
[03:05:00]  and it's not her, he knows that it's the wrong letter.  And so now he will not give her the letter back.  And she's just demanding that he give it back to her.  Was she supposed to give it?  Was he supposed to give it back to her?  I don't think so, because if it's not addressed to her,  it's not her mail, so...  And give me the fucking things back.  Ma'am.  Ma'am, I can't.  The police officer was right there in the front of my nose.  Give me the fucking things back.  I don't want the letter.  Please don't do that, ma'am.  Please don't do that.  I will.  I don't want the letter.  Give me the cards back.  Ma'am, please don't do that.  I said, I don't want the letter.  Give me the cards back. 
[03:05:30]  Ma'am, you already signed for me.  Yes, I keep it.  I sign.  I don't want it.  Ma'am, please don't do that.  It's not for me.  This is not for me.  This is not for me.  It's the wrong name.  How can it be the wrong name?  Because this is...  I do not...  The Rotary Club, the other...  My husband, this is not for me.  They've addressed it to the wrong person.  I don't want it.  I don't want to legally open it,  and I want it back.  I don't sign for somebody else's mail.  Ma'am, can you just bring it back to the office instead?  No, take it back because it's not mine. 
[03:06:00]  Ma'am, no, I cannot give you this, ma'am.  You want the signatures, you fucking nigger thief?  You want me to lock you up for life, you asshole?  Give me my stiff shit back.  Ma'am.  And I'm not prejudiced,  but right now I'm getting real pissed off.  Ma'am, why are you calling me names?  I mean, I'm just delivering your bill.  Because you're acting like a nigger.  Now give me the cards back.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  You didn't see this yet?  Wow.  You got to see it.  Oh, there's a video of it? 
[03:06:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, somebody said it.  Right here.  Sideways.  I mean, asked if it was my mom.  Yes, it's a sideways video.  No, no, no, no.  That wasn't an argument.  You know what?  How does that guy not haul off and knock her teeth out?  We got part two.  She really gets revved up.  All right, ma'am.  I'm going to have to go, ma'am.  I'm sorry.  Give me the cards back.  Ma'am, I'm sorry.  Why are you calling me the N-man?  Because you're acting like a moron.  Give me the cards back.  That's M.  I can't, ma'am.  Call me a nigger.  Could you give me the card back? 
[03:07:00]  I can't, ma'am.  Ma'am, why are you...  What was that again?  She went and she started reaching for her.  Yeah, she goes to like...  I think she went to like smack him or whatever.  Oh, double rainbow.  He's playing it off because he knows he's videotaping.  Ma'am, why you slap me, ma'am?  Why you slap me again?  I can't drop you, idiot. 
[03:07:30]  Ma'am, why you slapping me?  Why do you want to do this?  You killed Martin Luther King.  You niggers turn on each other.  You stupid.  You turn on me on your litter.  You dumb.  Ma'am.  I'll go under.  I can't.  Why you slap me, ma'am?  Because I want my fucking thing.  Why you calling me a thief?  Because you won't give me the cards back.  I can't give you the cards back, ma'am.  You know what those people are doing?  Yes.  What they're doing?  What they are doing, ma'am.  I mean, I don't know.  I don't know them.  I educate you so fast  so that you'd understand. 
[03:08:00]  The black women are against the black men  because they've been exploited so much.  They're with the Hitler-esque people.  They're with the white people.  They work against black men underneath it all.  There are very few white women  who have the strength to work for the black men.  Can you give me a chance to call my employer  before you slap me again?  I cannot.  And you're going to turn on me and then...  I'm not going to turn on you, ma'am.  I just believe that you're male and you slap me.  But your IQs are lower.  And so they're for the people who need to help you  you don't believe in.  Because you've been a kid  kept from being educated in the norm's dreams 
[03:08:30]  for so many years  that the other people forged ahead.  And it's true.  You have to understand this.  My mother taught at a black school, okay?  I looked at all the IQ scores of the kids.  Well, listen to me.  She taught at a black school every year.  Ma'am, I don't want to hear that story.  I don't want to hear that story.  Wow.  Wow, and she's something else.  Oh, my God.  And the tone she uses it.  Yeah, yeah.  She's educating him.  She softens up her delivery a little bit 
[03:09:00]  to make it really hurt.  Here's the deal.  What the fuck, man?  Wow, man.  Yeah, that's everywhere.  Yeah, how did that guy not clock her?  That piece of video is everywhere.  Because he's not educated enough to understand.  Right, that's right.  She said why.  Yeah, yeah, the IQ is a little lower.  I forgot.  Where was that?  Hingham or something like that?  That's got to be some fucking...  That's outside Boston.  Oh, is it?  I think.  Okay, that makes sense now.  What town are we looking at? 
[03:09:30]  Now it makes sense.  Let me go to Brendan in Massachusetts.  Brendan!  Hey, this is Brendan in Massachusetts.  That lady was totally justified.  He was acting like an end person.  Well, that's what she said.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's a lot of those in around Hingham.  Crazy old white ladies who are entitled bitches.  Yeah.  That's what she sounded like.  I'll give you that.  All right, sir.  Let me go to Cleveland.  Jeff, tough loss for the Browns yesterday.  How are you, sir? 
[03:10:00]  Good.  He's good.  He's doing well.  He's doing well.  Jeff from Cleveland.  Jeff, are you there?  Jeff, are you there?  What's up?  Open and end today.  Open and end today's show on the fires.  Sirius XM. </pre>
