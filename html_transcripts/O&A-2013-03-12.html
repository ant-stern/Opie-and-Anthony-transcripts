<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with a discussion of one host's experience playing SimCity.  The host detailed his city-planning strategies, including his (self-described) "liberal" and hypocritical tax policies targeting the wealthy, and the resulting chaotic consequences within his virtual city. This was followed by a retrospective on Van Halen, heavily influenced by a recent in-studio interview with David Lee Roth.  The hosts discussed Roth's personality, his complex relationship with Eddie Van Halen, his post-Van Halen career, and the various lineup changes and musical styles across the band's history, including playing a clip of a Gary Cherone-era song.  They also touched on their past experiences with other musicians associated with Van Halen, including Sammy Hagar and members of Extreme and Godsmack.  Notable moments included the host's SimCity strategies, Riley jumping on the couch, and a photo-bombing incident after the David Lee Roth interview.  David Lee Roth himself was a guest earlier in the show, though not during this specific segment.

The show then transitioned to a discussion about tequila and a night out at Guy Fieri's restaurant with Troy Kwan, who became heavily intoxicated and behaved boisterously in Times Square. This led to a discussion of Roland's unexpectedly successful "Food Court" radio show segment, which preempted E-Rock's scheduled show.  The hosts praised Roland's preparation and impressive guest list, including a hedge fund manager and a chef.  E-Rock's plans for a podcast network (featuring *The Simpsons*, a personal life podcast, a childhood friends podcast, and a radio industry podcast) were heavily discussed, with the hosts playfully teasing his vague explanations and perceived lack of decisiveness.  A potential "trade" of Sal to another station was also jokingly proposed.  Opie shared personal anecdotes about past relationships, including a summer romance that ended badly in Boston, and discussed feeling "out of his league" with previous girlfriends.  A David Lee Roth radio ad was played during this segment.

The next segment featured more of Opie's personal relationship stories, often vulgar and self-deprecating, interwoven with his excitement about an upcoming urban exploration video with Moses Gates.  This video involved exploring illegal locations like Amtrak tunnels and an abandoned World's Fair observation tower, with Gates using a grappling hook for access. Opie discussed Steve Duncan and the online urban exploration community, highlighting the dangers and his own anxiety.  The hosts then heavily criticized Michael Bloomberg's failed soda ban in New York City, calling it "arbitrary and capricious," playing clips of Bloomberg's press conference, and highlighting its inconsistencies.  They argued for personal responsibility over government intervention, and criticized the hypocrisy of targeting large sodas while ignoring other sugary foods. A caller from Atlanta suggested a tiered pricing model for soda sizes.

Another segment focused on Bloomberg's soda ban, but also included a vulgar discussion about food preferences (particularly cheese and cured meats, and Cheez-Its), professional wrestling (Fandango's gimmick and Paul Bearer's death being incorporated into storylines), and Justin Bieber's failed attempts at projecting a "tough guy" image.  Numerous callers participated in the soda ban discussion, and Sam Roberts hosted the after-show, which again covered E-Rock's podcast plans.

Finally, the broadcast concluded with a heated argument between Troy and Eric about Eric's lack of follow-through on promised podcast projects, filled with personal insults.  The hosts and other on-air personalities (Sal and Johnny) participated in the conflict, along with several callers.  Kevin O'Leary ("Mr. Wonderful") from *Shark Tank* then joined the show, discussing his experiences on the show, his investment strategies, and his blunt critiques.  He briefly commented on the earlier argument between Troy and Eric, ultimately declining to invest in Eric's podcast network. The segment ended with promotions for *Shark Tank* and further discussion of business and investment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Gregorio!  Antonio!  I don't know about this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Said show is on said road.  That's right.  Yes.  Let's see what this thing can do.  Yes.  What do you say?  Let's crank it up.  My God.  Oh, ah. 
[00:00:30]  Let's all clear our voices.  Yes.  So phlegmy.  There it is.  My eyes are fucking burning.  Yeah.  From hours and hours.  SimCity.  Of SimCity, yes.  Oh, you got your game.  It finally works, yeah.  Nice.  So, and what do you think?  I like it, yeah.  Yeah?  It's always a fun kind of game.  So, um, but, uh, I noticed I do some things that are a little hypocritical. 
[00:01:00]  What do you mean?  Well.  You get along with blacks?  Uh, no.  That's, uh, I had, um.  What's hypocritical?  Well, I, uh, I, I start building, you know, I do what the game is, you know, building a  city, residential, industrial, and commercial areas.  What city does it look like?  And commercial areas.  I don't know.  It's kind of a mini, mini Manhattan-looking thing.  Yeah, right.  Um, I get to the point where, you know, a lot of buildings start coming up and the skyscrapers 
[00:01:30]  start being built instead of little houses.  Wait, wait, wait.  Slow down a little bit.  Yeah.  Please, please.  It's early.  Yes.  Do you start with just land?  It's just land.  And then you could, like, build a tiny little village, little, uh, like, little house on  the prairie shit?  Yeah, you start off, you know, you put, you lay down some roads.  Okay.  You lay down some goddamn roads.  Gotcha.  And then you got-  What kind of roads do you go with?  Boston roads or you go with the nice grid system that we have here in New York City?  You know, you'd like to have a complete grid system, and then you realize why it's not  like that in Manhattan. 
[00:02:00]  Like, when you get to lower Manhattan, it gets a little squirrely.  Right, right, right.  You know, Brooklyn is a lot different than that.  Okay.  So I try to start with a nice grid, but it ends up you gotta throw something in there,  and then you get that angle.  Oh, no.  Like where the flat iron building is.  And that's where the traffic problems start, right?  And then there's some traffic problems there.  What about some roundabouts?  I don't like the roundabout.  Why?  Go old school, one roundabout.  I shunt.  You don't remember your time in Boston?  I don't like the roundabouts.  No.  Not at all.  All right.  I, uh, I lay down some roads, and then when you upgrade the roads-  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, I'm sorry. 
[00:02:30]  I gotta keep going here.  Because I'm a newbie to the new Sim City.  I'm with ya.  Now, when you start out your little roads in your houses, is it modern day, or do you  kinda go back in time?  It's all modern day.  All right.  So you're basically in the year 2013, trying to build a new city, like in the middle of  nowhere.  Yeah.  Gotcha.  All right.  I'll shut up.  No, that's cool.  It's pretty much it.  And then you upgrade the roads, and you make the plots bigger between the streets.  You know, because I noticed I was making the grids a little too tight. 
[00:03:00]  Okay.  And then I noticed I wasn't getting any skyscrapers going up.  Right.  So I started eliminating that, making bigger squares for blocks, and big skyscrapers start  going up.  And then I realized, like, oh man, I got a lot of shit going on.  And I allotted a lot of money to things like the fire department, police, and even schools.  Go figure that out.  Nice.  That's part of my hypocritical part, what I actually put in for education.  Gotcha.  And then I noticed, oh shit, things are, you know, things are starting to, like, I'm spending 
[00:03:30]  a lot of money.  And the first thing I do is start raising taxes on the wealthy.  No, I do.  Yes, I do.  They don't complain as much.  I fucking jack those bastards up.  Oh my god, it's hilarious.  Until they start screaming, and then I pull it back a little bit.  Right.  So they get happy that I lowered taxes.  But I fucked them.  You fucked them for a while.  I raised those goddamn taxes on those rich.  Do your fair share in my city. 
[00:04:00]  Ah, that's really funny.  That's really funny.  Do your fair share.  Do you have a soda ban in your SimCity game?  No, I haven't gone with a soda ban yet.  Okay.  I may, though.  And then transportation, you know, I got to get the buses running and put up bus stops.  Well, I'm not up to an airport yet.  No.  I don't have an airport yet, but I'm looking.  Is there waterfront?  It is waterfront.  So I got a dock that cruise ships come to, and I have some tourism coming in there.  And I laid down a train station. 
[00:04:30]  Nice.  And I got oil well, because I realized there was oil on my land.  Do you have a bad neighborhood?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I had to put some residential housing by the industrial places where the pollution is the worst.  That's where you put them?  Yeah.  That's where I put my low-income housing, because, you know, not in my backyard.  With a giant fence around the whole thing?  No one really goes there.  There's nothing there. 
[00:05:00]  There's nothing good.  There's no good parks.  Like, you can put parks in the area, too.  And the parks get people working in the parks, so you get a wealthier area.  And it's just nicer for the families to go down there and stuff.  And it increases the value of the land around it.  So you build this stuff, and then the gang starts making people appear, because they're  kind of happy with what you're doing?  Yep.  They really have.  I got a pretty happy city there.  Nice.  But, yeah, there are some bad areas.  I noticed through trial and error that you should pay attention to where you're putting  your water supply and your sewage treatment plants. 
[00:05:30]  You don't want to keep your sewage by your drinking water.  Are you just throwing it in the river?  The sewage?  I was initially just fucking sewage plowing up, but then I got to a point where I was  able to make a sewage treatment plant.  Okay.  So I got one of those, and I'm just about ready to put a nuclear power plant in and  get rid of the oil burn ones.  But if they don't hire a good staff for the nuclear power plant, it could be some problems. 
[00:06:00]  Of course.  So I'll make sure that there's enough people to...  What about natural disasters?  Well, it can happen.  You could turn randomizer on where it just happens.  Right.  Or you can actually start one up.  I don't know why you would do that.  It's just...  I guess if you want to ruin the place, you're just like, ah, here's some tornadoes.  Oh, wow.  And you'll just cut a big swath of shit through there.  Really?  There's fires all the time, though.  And I have a department of safety that I added on to town hall. 
[00:06:30]  And I got a lot of good fire departments and a lot of fire trucks.  And still, the place is like, burns down.  Wow, man.  That looks like a lot to worry about.  There is.  There's a lot of shit going on at once.  Iraq, comment?  Does it have power grid issues sometimes where you see the lightning bolt over a building  saying it's not getting enough power?  You know what?  I am so glad they did away with having to lay down power lines and plumbing.  When you lay down roads, it automatically...  That's where your power and your plumbing goes. 
[00:07:00]  Okay.  And your sewage.  Because that was the biggest pain in the ass.  It's like, oh, I got to fucking lay down power lines.  A little too much micromanagement there.  Now, I see that that's like kind of just suburbia there.  Can you put a ridiculous highway in the middle of a neighborhood?  Oh, yeah.  A neighborhood?  Yeah, yeah.  Just to see what happens?  I've done that with a big two-laner.  Just cut right through a fucking...  The thing is clogs up all the side streets because they're not really big enough to handle  the traffic.  Right. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  And, yeah, so I got oil wells that are supplying oil and selling oil and stuff.  And I'm on a board where other people can join in and build their cities in the same  region.  Right.  And then I could connect like a trucking line or a train line to them.  And get a little trade operation going.  But what if they have a shitty city?  That's just it.  Yeah.  It's like the real world.  And could you go futuristic?  No, they don't have any future stuff.  You can't build like Jetsons houses or anything like that? 
[00:08:00]  You know Jetsons stuff?  They got a lot of things that you can build like big stadiums for games and tourism.  Right.  And, yeah, it's just, it's one of those games that you just sit there for hours on end staring  at the screen and just dink.  You can watch TV at the same time.  It's not like a first person shooter, you know?  Right.  You watch TV and then you look down and go, ah, I got enough money.  I'm going to pop that up.  Can you build a skyscraper that's way too tall?  Boy, I don't know.  I got some pretty big ones going up now.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm getting there. 
[00:08:30]  And it's good because then more people can move in.  And the more people you get, the more places you need for business.  And then you get more money pouring in because you get taxed the shit out of them.  It's amazing.  And then I get loans.  And how big can these cities get?  Well, I'm working with one that's, ah, it's all relative.  So it's kind of hard to say how big, but you get a lot of fucking people.  And then you can take over other cities, too.  You could open up a new region and connect the two by a big highway or rail system. 
[00:09:00]  That'd be way too much to take care of.  Oh, and then you've got to go back and forth.  You might as well be a father at that point.  Exactly.  If you're going to be taking care of that much stuff.  Precisely.  And apparently I'm not a very good dad because, um.  Fine.  Well, Andrew's over yesterday.  Yeah.  Taking care of the house as she normally does.  And, uh, and the lovely Mrs. Travis, uh, was shopping in the area and wanted to visit.  Her and Andrew are very good friends.  And they came by and brought adorable little Riley.  So, uh, uh, Riley goes, Uncle Anthony, look! 
[00:09:30]  And she had taken all the pillows from the back of my couch and laid them down on the couch.  She goes, I'm going to jump over them.  And she's got her little sneakers on that light up.  Yep.  And she's jumping on my couch over the pillows.  And I'm just like, oh, wow!  Wow, that's pretty cool.  And, and I got yelled at by Travis's wife.  Why?  Don't just let her do that!  She's jumping on the couch with her shoes on!  And I'm like, I don't know!  And then Ange laughed at me that she did it and I got yelled at. 
[00:10:00]  Did you throw the couch away?  No!  There might be footprints on it now, though.  She's not a nose picker.  It's all about the nose picking.  Yeah.  You can handle a footprint?  Nose picking.  For the new listeners, Anthony once threw out a couch because a kid hit a booger somewhere on the couch.  Yeah, some kid picked his nose and wiped it underneath one of the cushions.  Right.  Or in between two cushions.  And then I couldn't find it.  So I, I threw the couch away.  You gave it the old heave-ho.  Yeah.  Couch had to go.  You know, I used to love the Sim games.  I think I might have to check out Sim City. 
[00:10:30]  It's pretty good.  Like I said.  It hasn't played in years, I'll be honest with you.  It's probably, probably been eight, nine years.  Wow, it hasn't been that long?  Probably.  It's not one of those action-packed games, obviously.  No, I know.  That's why I like it.  But it's just kind of a good, you sit back and relax.  Iraq.  You haven't ventured into building casinos and racetracks yet?  Not yet.  I hear the gambling really ups the crime rate in your city.  So you got a kind of preemptive strike with a lot of police precincts and jails and stuff. 
[00:11:00]  How do you get your city, because I remember when I used to play back in the day, how do  you get your city to the point of no return where you can't fix it anymore?  Oh, where it's just busted.  Where it's just fucking complete mayhem.  It's losing money.  I love that.  Everyone's moving out.  Because that's what these games end up being.  They're fun for a while and you want to make it all nice.  Like, ooh, look what I did.  But then you get bored and like, okay, let's let this shit start rotting.  Well, when I raised taxes on everybody, because I didn't have a department of finance yet, 
[00:11:30]  and unless you have a department of finance, when you raise taxes, you have to raise it  on every citizen.  So I finally got a department of finance.  Before I did, I raised taxes on everyone.  And then I noticed a lot of abandoned buildings.  And as you go over the abandoned buildings, because you've got to destroy them because  it leads to crime and people not being happy, I noticed when you go over them, it tells  why the building's abandoned.  It said, tax is too high, tax is too high, tax is too high.  So people just start moving out and you lose the number of people you have, you lose jobs. 
[00:12:00]  It's terrible.  So I had to get a department of finance so I could just tax those fucking one percenters,  the wealthy.  So I tax them and they bitch and gripe.  But you know what?  They don't move out and they keep paying.  I like it.  Are you an Occupy Wall Street guy in your SimCity game?  Man, I'm such a liberal fucking mayor of my city.  I'm terrible.  Of course you are.  It just doesn't seem to work the other way.  Shut up.  People get all pissed off.  I can't whip them into shape. 
[00:12:30]  Be quiet.  I'm going to have to fucking figure out how to just beat the shit out of the lower class.  Put it all the weight on the middle class's back and let those wealthy prosper.  Then you played for how many hours?  I was watching, like I said, I was watching TV, but it's constantly just on the laptop  right in front of me.  So it was probably a good 12 hours.  You have 12 hours to kill?  Yeah.  How's that like? 
[00:13:00]  Oh, tell me about it, please.  It's magical.  Look, I'm going to just put my palms on my fucking chin and listen.  From like noon to midnight.  Really?  Just watching TV, playing a game, a little glass of wine.  Oh, it's wonderful.  I had an hour to myself yesterday.  An hour?  A whole hour.  I got to walk around a little bit while the kids napped.  Wow.  I like just wandering around the city like a hobo.  Just alone for an hour.  I love it.  I have nowhere to go. 
[00:13:30]  I just wander.  That sounds great.  Wander with my stupid camera just in case something pops up.  I had an hour yesterday.  Gee.  And then I was editing a video with a crying five-month-old on my left knee.  Oh, that's nice.  So that was almost some time to myself.  That's close enough, really.  You really had 12 hours?  12 hours.  God.  To just do nothing.  I remember.  Oh, it was great.  You know, when you become a parent, you realize how much you took for granted your time. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  I used to have fucking blocks of time where I'm like, eh, this is just a block of time.  I can do whatever I want.  I'm just going to kill four hours just sitting in front of a coffee shop.  Oh, my God.  Or sleeping.  But you just took it for granted.  Yeah.  Sleeping?  What's that like?  Tell me about it.  It's magical.  Really?  I can nod off whenever I damn well please.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  That's awesome.  If I'm on the couch and I notice I'm just kind of, huh, what, nodding off, I'll just 
[00:14:30]  like grab a pillow.  Right.  Throw it on the armrest of the couch.  Right.  Lay down.  Boom.  I'm asleep.  I don't even set an alarm.  When I wake up, that's when I wake up.  But don't the noises in your house wake you up?  Like kids running and screaming?  I, uh, not a peep.  Not a peep.  Although last night, man, I'm trying to get to sleep.  No kids opening your door in the middle of a good sleep?  Oh, nothing like that.  To comment that Daddy's sleeping?  Nah.  That's all it takes for me to wake up? 
[00:15:00]  Last night in the middle of, I was just going to sleep and I hear this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm like, what the fuck?  One of the smoke detectors, the battery.  Oh my God.  But I couldn't figure out which one it was.  Why is it?  I don't know.  Why can't it just light up slightly or something?  Something.  Because it only goes off for that split second and you don't know where it's coming from  and they got that noise figured out because it's as annoying as a gnat in your fucking ear. 
[00:15:30]  And it was so vague.  A mosquito, whatever.  And you could be standing in one spot and then you turn 90 degrees and you don't hear  it as much.  So it could be anywhere.  So you're like, wait, I think it's the one on the left.  All right.  I'm now going to just stare at the one on the left.  And then that time seems to be forever.  Yeah.  And then you give up like, oh, fuck it.  And it went off.  That's not it.  So I run downstairs.  Right.  And I hear the beep again and realize it's not even downstairs. 
[00:16:00]  It was like in the basement.  No.  So I run down to the basement and I hear it's loud.  Now I don't know where it is.  So I'm looking around.  There's so many of them.  You ever have one go off, let's say, at a horrible time, let's say middle of the night.  Yeah.  It wakes you up with that first beep.  You're like, you know what?  I can handle this.  Oh, no.  There's no handling that.  Have you tried?  Well, last night.  I'm like, I can handle this.  It was like three in the morning.  And then I put a pillow over my ear.  I'm like, I'll just deal with that shit in the morning. 
[00:16:30]  You always get up.  Like you throw the covers off and you have to go, shit.  Like I just went, God, fuck.  Because I live in a building in Manhattan.  They have them like, they have them hardwired and they also have the batteries in them.  But they also have them like sealed.  I don't know if that's some kind of law.  Probably.  So it's really hard to get at the batteries.  So when that shit happens, I'll take it off the ceiling and I try to bury it somewhere in my house until I can fucking handle it proper.  Yeah.  And it's still, and you can still hear it. 
[00:17:00]  I'll put it under the fucking couch cushions.  I'll pile blankets and pillows.  I'm like burying it.  It's amazing.  Until morning.  Because you pretty much have to break the thing open to get the batteries out.  I don't know why.  Because people would just disable them.  Yeah, they don't want them disabled at all.  And they obviously don't want them disabled.  So, yeah, it was a pain in the ass.  I finally found it, though. 
[00:17:30]  And, of course, you know, replace the battery.  No, it's 3.30 in the morning.  Right.  I'm just going to fucking twist it, take the battery out, and leave it on the poker table.  That was it.  That was one of the odds of a fire.  Ah, fuck it.  What are the odds of the fire when your alarm is shot?  Oh, boy.  Shot.  Yeah.  I got new alarm guys coming in, too.  Yeah?  Yeah, they revamped my cam system.  So now it's all night vision.  Nice.  And I want to have some of those electronic locks and fucking lights and heat and everything 
[00:18:00]  all taken care of.  So I could just be here.  And before I go home, I'm like, let me crank up the A.C.  Can you shoot someone from here?  I could probably hook it up.  You could hook it up where you could actually shoot somebody?  Yeah, I could probably rig a gun to aim at the front door.  And then if I'm looking, just have it fire at the door.  Or through the door, like Biden says.  You know, just have a double-barrel shotgun and just fire it through the door.  Or just what?  What did he say?  Just fire it in the air?  Fired in the air.  A couple of blasts. 
[00:18:30]  He said a couple of blasts from the double-barrel shotgun.  Hey, Biden, not all of us live in the sticks.  I can't just fire a shotgun where I live.  You go to jail for discharging a firearm in the city limits.  Right.  Unless there's a reason.  But as they're taking your way, you go, look, Biden said.  Biden said.  Well, somebody shot through a door and went to jail.  Got arrested.  And used, you know, hey, the vice president said.  It's a Biden excuse.  I don't care what you say.  But Biden also, yeah, he said a couple of blasts from a shotgun chases anyone away. 
[00:19:00]  And you don't need an AR-15.  They're harder to aim.  Someone put together a great video of women and girls firing shotguns and just being flown on their asses.  Sure.  Losing the gun.  The gun flies out of their hands.  Sure.  They get their tits shot.  They're like, ow!  And then they show women shooting an AR-15.  And it's just like, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, all nice and steady and straight.  Is this a viral video? 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, that one.  Well, that isn't the Biden one, though.  That isn't the Biden shotgun one.  This is just women shooting any type of pistols, like, big...  Oh, my God.  It hit her in the forehead.  Fucking...  I've seen these type of videos before.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, God.  That had to break her wrist.  It came back.  Oh, fuck.  That had to hurt.  They're very, um...  And now she can't get...  She keeps firing.  She can't stop shooting it.  And if you get her finger off the trigger...  It makes her go backwards.  And she fell right on her ass. 
[00:20:00]  Fell backwards.  Shotguns are not the easiest fucking thing to shoot.  They do have a bit of a kick.  Mm-hmm.  Especially the old school double barrel.  Too blast from your double barrel.  I'll take care of business.  Well, fuck, man.  SimCity sounds good.  Yeah, it's pretty fun.  I honestly don't have 12 hours, though.  You'd have, like, a house and a little...  I know.  One little factory, and you'd be like,  I can't play anymore.  I gotta save it.  I gotta save it for later. 
[00:20:30]  I know.  Oh, look, I was able to put in a water tower.  But I gotta save it.  I gotta get those kids in school,  so you get back to gaming.  Right?  What age can you start them at?  Can you put a five-month-old in school somewhere?  Isn't there, like, pre-K or something?  Yeah, my, uh...  The pre-pre-K.  My older one is doing that in the fall.  Here comes the pre.  I remember we started school at five, right?  Dude, I went to kindergarten.  That was my first foray into school,  was kindergarten.  And I think it was five, six,  kind of that age. 
[00:21:00]  Before that,  it was sitting with mommy watching cartoons  around the house.  I didn't go to preschool.  It was nothing like that.  There was no activities.  There was nowhere for a kid that age to go.  The mother was expected  to just take care of the fucking kid  until he was great for kindergarten.  You didn't have...  Well, I guess they always had nannies,  I would assume,  but we didn't...  We didn't know what that was.  We had moms that just raised us.  That was it.  And then somewhere in there,  like, you know,  because it got way too expensive to live, 
[00:21:30]  you had a...  Mommy had to get a job.  Oh, yeah.  We do come from a time  that mommies just didn't get a job  unless they wanted to  because they had a profession or whatever.  They didn't have to work, though.  Yep.  And now every single mom has to work.  My brother got the babysitting gig  way early in my family.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, boy.  Once pops decided, you know,  he'd had it.  Right.  Mom had to go to work,  and she wasn't going to hire a babysitter. 
[00:22:00]  She did a couple of times,  but then she realized,  you know what?  You guys were fucking the babysitter?  What are these kids?  Those kumias get started early.  I learned that recently.  My God.  I love the babysitters.  Not fucking the babysitters,  but a little, you know...  Finger-popping?  A little touchy-feely.  See what the deal...  See what the dillio was.  You can't touchy-feely your babysitter.  Feelio.  What the fuck did I just say?  They seemed so old at the time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I remember my mom needed help, 
[00:22:30]  so my younger sister  was sort of raising my younger brothers.  Really?  One of them being the owner of F.H. Riley's  there in Huntington.  Brett.  Yeah.  And she would give them baths.  Whoa.  That's a little weird.  Yeah.  Well, she was...  Well, they were 15,  and she was...  They were probably four,  and she was six.  Oh, wow.  I think she's only two years older than them.  That is weird.  Isn't that strange?  Yeah, that's a little strange.  We just assumed it...  We just accepted it as whatever, 
[00:23:00]  but now that we're older,  we're like,  that's a little weird.  A six-year-old giving four-year-olds baths.  A little odd.  Is that the age difference?  Something like that.  Yeah.  Maybe two and a half years apart.  Yeah.  Between my sister and the twins.  Anyway.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was...  My brother took over the babysitting duties,  which was kind of weird,  because we were all just still fucking one...  And it was one day we needed a babysitter,  and then the next day it's like, 
[00:23:30]  oh, we don't have one.  Now we're on our own,  like fucking Lord of the Flies in the house here.  Did your brother take it seriously at first?  Because he got that power?  I don't think so.  Oh, no.  Oh, that's cool.  No, he really didn't give a shit.  He's not much older than you,  so that's really strange.  Those were the days  that we were able to eat  all the ice cream sandwiches.  Nice.  And Uncle Joe would call us bummers.  You bummers.  You bummers.  Every time I eat ice cream sandwiches now,  especially when I'm taking the last one  out of the box in the freezer,  I just think Uncle Joe 
[00:24:00]  throwing that box at us  and calling us bummers.  Just say to yourself,  I'm a bummer.  I'm a bummer.  Hey, I want to mention David Lee Roth.  Yes.  That was amazing yesterday.  Unbelievable.  We've been waiting for the day  we'd finally talk to David Lee Roth  and our paths  because the radio kind of crossed  for a little while there.  And he's been, you know,  the legendary singer of Van Halen  for forever.  And we certainly spent our time  over the years  making fun of him a little bit. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  And I got to tell you, man,  we fucking hit it off  with the guy yesterday.  It was a lot of fun, man.  The feedback I got,  most people, you know,  you always got some asshole.  Oh, of course.  But in general,  most people really,  really enjoyed  the two hours we spent  with David Lee Roth yesterday.  It was pretty cool.  You know, he goes off.  You know, he's one of those guys  you got to worry about  a little bit  because he does ramble,  but it was all interesting.  Yeah.  And he kept,  like I was saying to you 
[00:25:00]  just before the show,  he kept getting,  going back on point.  Yeah.  That's when you thought  he lost it or whatever,  he would get back on point.  Yeah.  I laughed so hard,  I got a headache yesterday  from laughing so much.  It was fucking great.  He just,  talking about everything.  The old Van Halen days,  what he was doing after it,  how he felt, you know,  playing a smaller place  as opposed to the bigger.  And like all that shit  is just stuff you'd,  yeah, you'd want to  ask David Lee Roth.  And I know a little bit  about Van Halen  and how the band works  like anyone else  by just kind of,  you know,  paying attention. 
[00:25:30]  But what I learned yesterday,  Eddie Van Halen  and David Lee Roth  never got along.  Never.  I always thought  they were like,  they got together,  they were brothers.  Right, right.  Like we got this thing,  we're best friends,  they hung all the time together  and they wrote these songs.  But he pretty much  admitted yesterday  they never got along.  No.  Because they just came  from very different lives.  They were talking about that,  he was talking about  the time they went  to that concert  and what was it,  the Earth, Wind & Fire 
[00:26:00]  or the other one.  And he said,  yeah,  we weren't even talking then.  Right.  And they weren't even  a band yet.  They weren't a band.  I mean,  they were a band  but they weren't  not like Van Halen.  They weren't Van Halen  as we know them.  Unbelievable.  Never really got along.  I had no idea.  I mean,  you know,  when you work together  with somebody  you got your ups and downs  but with these guys  they never,  never were on the same page  in a way  like where they could hang  and just,  you know,  like each other.  I got to think  Dave's maniacal personality 
[00:26:30]  is probably rough  for everybody  to get into.  Right.  But I got to think  Eddie Van Halen  is just a fucking  prick on wheels.  We've talked to Eddie  over the years  and he,  I never got that impression,  did you?  I don't know.  Professionally though?  I see now that we've  finally got to talk  to David Lee Roth  in person.  We've talked to  Eddie Van Halen  in person.  It's been many years  since we've done that  but we have,  you can see  they're two drastically 
[00:27:00]  different people.  Not even,  because you couldn't  imagine them  even bumping  into each other.  Because Eddie  and Alex,  they want to stay focused  and you know  David Lee Roth  just was throwing  them curveballs  all the fucking time.  Yeah.  You know,  just some ridiculous  thing that they  had to deal with.  Yeah.  And you know,  probably a lot  of that stuff  did end up working out  and making for  some great songs.  Yeah.  But it was probably  exhausting.  But I love  David Lee Roth  because he's such  a free spirit. 
[00:27:30]  That guy knows  how to live.  He just like  comes up with something  and he's like  yeah,  I'll try that.  Yeah,  he said,  you know what?  Give that a whirl.  You know,  I mean,  none of us,  us and everyone  listening to our voices,  none of us  could just go,  you know what,  I'm going to go  live in Japan now  for a while.  Yeah.  But I mean,  he knows he has that  and he goes for it.  And he just ended up  there and decided  I'll stay for a while.  I'll stay here  and I'll learn Japanese.  Yeah.  I mean,  the guy's got to be  pushing 60  and he's still trying  to like learn shit. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  That's fucked.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah.  I was thinking  CBS Radio,  they just blew it  with him.  Yeah,  they did.  Because they just  couldn't think  out of the box.  And we were guilty  of making fun of him  as well.  But someone,  I was thinking,  you know who I was  thinking about yesterday  after the interview  was John Minnelli.  Oh,  right.  Who's,  you know,  what's his title  really?  Now?  Well,  he's still consulting  and stuff.  Is he?  But he's,  he was a guy 
[00:28:30]  that we worked  with for a while  and I,  I,  I always liked  John Minnelli  and he was always  trying to do,  you know,  different shit  with radio.  If,  if John Minnelli  had a David Lee Roth,  he would have made it work.  Yeah,  just something a little  different.  But instead,  he had to like deal  with those fucking  suits over there  at CBS.  They can't,  they can't,  they can't work  with a mind  like David Lee Roth.  No.  Because someone like that,  you got to really  just let him go  and just kind of,  you know,  trust that you,  you hired the right guy. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah,  he wanted to do  some interesting stuff  and they were just like,  no,  stay in the studio.  And that's what  fucked it up  because he wanted,  he wanted to do what  pretty much everyone's  doing now,  podcasting from  wherever the fuck.  Yeah.  That's what he wanted  to do,  you know,  eight years,  nine years ago  at this point.  Yeah.  But I really enjoyed  the time of David Lee Roth.  I hope he comes back.  That was fun.  And we're going to,  are we going to run  his podcast,  D-Rock?  Did we work that out?  His people contacted us  yesterday.  They got to work it  all out first  and then we'll get it on.  Oh,  I'm sure that,  oh boy, 
[00:29:30]  they're looking for money.  Money,  money,  money.  No,  we have no money.  I think they want to,  to give the show to us  to let us run.  It's just,  you know,  we got to get legal documents  and everything.  Yeah,  we just want to,  you know,  sneak an hour on here  and there  like we do with  the rest of the guys.  Yeah,  friends of the show,  which we probably  should start expanding,  I'm thinking.  I'm sure it'll be  something like,  you know,  you can't play it  every day of the week  for,  you know.  No,  no,  we just want to,  we just want to put  an hour on every once in a while.  But I'm sure that's what they,  you know.  Oh, 
[00:30:00]  that's what he wants.  And they don't,  then it doesn't become  property of fucking  Sirius XM satellite.  You got to get your  dumb lawyers in there.  Yeah,  yeah.  Sirius,  like if you accidentally  walk through the door here  because you're looking  for the financial firm  upstairs,  they own everything  of yours.  It's like,  wait,  I just,  I walked in,  no,  no,  we now own everything.  Right.  You didn't read the fine print  on the door.  Yeah.  As we buzzed you in.  As soon as you enter  this establishment,  we own you. 
[00:30:30]  It's insanity.  I wonder if Scott Greenstein  talked to David Lee Roth  about doing a little  something,  something.  Oh.  Because he's one of those guys,  there you go,  just someone fucking  thinking,  you know,  differently.  Yeah,  yeah.  A free spirit guy.  What I also loved about  the David Lee Roth thing  was the fact that  every single,  wait,  did you,  you didn't get photo  bombed?  No,  because he snuck in first.  Oh,  we really did.  Shit,  Anthony's the only one  that didn't get photo  bombed.  I made it out of the  photo bomb.  Are you putting all the 
[00:31:00]  pictures up on Facebook  in one?  Fucking great.  I will,  yeah,  I'm going to put them  all up.  We all got destroyed  with photo bombs  trying to get our  pictures with David Lee Roth  after the show yesterday.  That was a good one  right there.  And snuck in right as  Jimmy was trying to get  something signed.  He goes,  okay,  get a photo.  And then everyone  realized it was photo  time and decided to  fuck with everybody.  Just destroys  everyone's pictures.  Well,  my picture with  David Lee Roth,  David Lee Roth  decided to shake my hand,  which always just makes  for weird fucking  awkward looking.  And then Jimmy's,  you could just see  Jimmy's nose and eyes 
[00:31:30]  behind.  Over both of your  shoulders.  Yeah.  And then you're  photo bombing Jimmy.  I'm photo bombing  Jimmy's photo bomb.  Yes.  And then everyone  just got destroyed  with their photos.  Yeah.  And then we got  Florentine.  Florentine.  Jimmy's between  their heads and I'm  over Florentine's  shoulder.  Yeah.  That's funny.  And Kenny's lumbering  into this picture.  Of course he is.  Sam getting  fucked over. 
[00:32:00]  You're appearing  like right out of  Sam's hair.  Yeah.  In the background.  I'm over Dave's  shoulder making  my De Niro face.  Yeah.  Who else?  Sorry.  This is,  they're very visual.  Because they're not  just,  they're not just,  they're just not,  it's not that they're  just photo bombs  for me.  Just completely  ridiculous,  twisted fucking  faces.  obnoxious.  Travis,  we're just waving  in the background. 
[00:32:30]  It's so obnoxious.  Roland.  Jimmy's making  some face.  Yeah.  It's all about  twisting the mouth  up and opening  the eyes wide.  boo.  Boo.  He rocked.  He rocked.  He rocked.  He rocked.  He rocked the  opie,  Jimmy,  and me.  He got the triple.  I love it.  That David Lee Roth  smiles hilarious.  He. 
[00:33:00]  What do you think?  You think he does a little  something something?  We should have asked him.  He would have answered.  He's always been like that.  He answered every question.  Yeah.  The closest he came to not  answering stuff was the  Hagar.  It seems like he gets along  with Michael Anthony.  Yeah.  But it seems like Michael  Anthony doesn't want anything  to do with Van Halen.  So what's the story there?  He's never really talked  about it.  He didn't want to.  I don't think he wanted  to start any fires.  I think he's about  building bridges,  Opie.  Well, 
[00:33:30]  David Lee Roth,  when I suggested that he  sings a few solo songs,  he goes,  you know what?  That's a great idea.  Maybe I'll talk to the guys.  Maybe I should bring that up.  No.  I don't think that would go  well.  You hear Van Halen  broke up again.  Yeah,  fucking Dave went.  He wanted to do some  of his solo stuff with the band,  which is a ridiculous idea.  And they said,  Opie's like,  oh man,  it's my idea.  Are you kidding me?  My idea for Van Halen.  But how cool would that be?  Why can't everyone  just say fuck it?  I'd like to see  David Lee Roth do  Yankee Rose.  That'd be kind of cool. 
[00:34:00]  There's a couple songs in there  that could easily work.  Yeah.  Also,  he does California Girls  or something.  That'd be pretty cool.  And then Eddie Valen  can make it his own  a little bit.  Yeah.  They don't have to make it  the exact song  like it was on the record.  But you throw a few  of those in there,  man,  hardcore Van Halen  slash David Lee Roth fans  would love it.  Oh yeah.  It would make the show  slightly different too.  You never know when  they're going to break  a couple of those out.  Why not?  Yeah,  that would be  pretty fucking cool.  Make David Lee Roth  sing a Gary Cherone  Van Halen song? 
[00:34:30]  Oh God.  The forgotten era.  I want to bring up  Gary Cherone so bad.  But then I realized  that we know Gary Cherone  and he's just a really nice guy.  So I'm like,  what are you doing?  He was me.  Not the guy.  Oh,  was he not the guy?  I remember we,  I think we saw Van Halen  with Gary Cherone.  I think we went up  to Boston for that.  Man,  I don't remember that.  I have no real memory of it,  but I feel like we did.  No one does.  I think it was through  BCN or something. 
[00:35:00]  That was something to just...  They were putting that together.  Didn't they call their album  Van Halen 3  or something like that?  Yeah.  Because they had 1, 2  and then with Gary Cherone  they decided just to call it 3.  And man,  that just didn't work out.  It was terrible.  Do you have any?  I'd love to hear one.  You got any with Gary Cherone?  What was the big song?  I don't think it was.  The big song.  Well,  the one they pushed.  The one that radio pushed.  Anyone?  Wheeler?  Was it about a hurricane  or some kind of high wind 
[00:35:30]  or...  What the fuck was it?  It wasn't Odara.  Shut up.  Odara.  Odara.  Oh, man.  If you give me a couple titles...  I'm looking for Van Halen 3 here.  I don't know if it's in the...  Wow, they didn't even put it  in the system, huh?  Oh, wait.  There's one song.  One song.  It's called  Year to the Day.  I guess Without You is...  Without You?  Without You is the big...  That was with Gary Cherone? 
[00:36:00]  I don't know.  That's what I'm getting at.  Yeah, see the wind.  Oh, there's the wind.  I told you.  Let's hear a little of this.  There's a music video with it.  Ooh.  We did this break, by the way.  I'll beat E-Rock to the Punks.  Did we?  Yes.  With Gary Cherone?  Yes.  I don't remember with Cherone.  We absolutely looked at this video.  So there you go.  You got the Van Halen sound.  Sounding Van Halen-ish.  Hey, you, wake up.  Get yourself together.  Yeah, you.  So you think you made it better? 
[00:36:30]  Because you know it's coming up the way you're right.  I think he was trying to go for a...  Yeah, I got it.  He was trying to go for a Hagar sound.  The Hagar years were very successful, obviously.  Yeah.  And they were trying to continue with that sound.  Yeah.  Because that's not Gary Cherone's voice, really.  No, and that's what killed him.  He couldn't do that live.  Right.  He had such a problem, because he was also singing the Van Hagar songs.  Right.  And it blew his fucking voice out.  Sammy Hagar, say what you want about him. 
[00:37:00]  The range on that fucker's voice is ridiculous.  And to have that gritty sound with the range...  Right.  If you just aren't born to be able to sing like that, you are going to fucking chew your vocal cords up.  Right.  And that's what he did.  No, I like Sammy Hagar.  I mean, that didn't sound like wholehearted, did it?  No.  No, not at all.  It didn't sound like...  If you didn't know any better, you would say, oh, that's a Sammy Hagar song.  Right.  That they never released or something.  Yes.  Yeah, play a little more of this.  Actually, it's not that bad.  It's not.  It sounds like... 
[00:37:30]  I am on my way home, and I make up your mind.  The Van Halen sound.  Man, did this just not work.  It's just kind of sitting there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's a lot of shit on that. 
[00:38:00]  What are they doing?  They're walking in an ice house.  There's women running in slow motion in an ice house.  This is when they still made videos.  What year was this, by the way?  98-ish.  Right?  Not really.  It's right around the time we were getting fired from Boston.  It's not bad, but it's like missing something. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  The vocals are a little buried, and it's not catchy enough.  Yeah.  There's no real catchy hook.  He's not as dynamic with the vocals as Sammy is.  But he's trying to be...  Has Gary Cherone ever talked about his time at Van Halen?  I don't think he can talk anymore after trying to sing like that.  Oh, my God.  He's a mute.  Poor guy.  Wow.  He took it on the chin, man.  Yeah. 
[00:39:00]  He was the sacrificial lamb.  Then what happened after Gary Cherone?  Did they bring Sammy Hagar back for a little bit?  I don't think...  Because that's 98.  What did happen?  That's 15 years ago.  What happened for all the 2000s?  That's 15 years ago.  Holy fuck.  So what happened after that?  I mean, David Lee Roth was gone for a really, really long time.  Yeah.  After that, surely, was the David Lee Roth-Hagar tour, right?  Well, yeah, because then they're like, well, fuck...  Then they're like, well, fuck you, Van Halen.  We're going to do this.  And so then it was the Sam and Dave tour.  I don't know how they figured that one out. 
[00:39:30]  They probably didn't really talk.  It was probably one of those things where, you know, one dressing room was on the left  side and the other was on the right side of the stage.  Yeah.  I don't know what happened after that, though.  That's a good question.  Like the 2000s.  What was Van Halen doing during the 2000s?  Yeah.  I think Hagar came back for a little bit, didn't he?  Yeah.  But it didn't work or something?  Yeah.  He did.  Did they actually come out with songs? 
[00:40:00]  I don't remember.  Reunion with Sammy, huh?  2003 to 2005.  Yeah.  So they did a couple more years with Sammy Hagar.  Then from 2005 to pre- what?  Three new songs.  Three new songs?  Three new songs.  What were the songs?  Were they hits?  Any hits in there?  It's About Time, Up for Breakfast, and Learning to See.  They put out like a double disc compilation, like Best Of.  Right, and then they had the three songs.  Yeah, so you buy them.  None of those songs hit.  No.  All right, then what happened at 2005? 
[00:40:30]  Oh, boy.  Then they went away for a year, and then they came back for another David Lee Roth reunion.  The second Roth reunion from 2006 to 2008.  What?  Whoa.  Okay.  And then what happened?  And then what happened?  2009 to present.  Yeah, I guess where we're at now.  Oh.  Wait, so the David Lee Roth, they started getting him back together around 2006?  Really?  It just never seems like they're really together. 
[00:41:00]  It seems like, ah, they're just hanging out for a little thing and decided to tour.  But, like, Van Halen, to me, Van Halen broke up.  First there was the David Lee Roth thing, and then there was the Sammy Hagar.  And after Sammy left, Van Halen was done.  Like, and has never been together again.  It was just...  When they got Sammy Hagar, I remember it was such a big fucking deal.  Like, holy shit, how is this going to work?  And then it did.  Because Hagar was huge at the time.  Right.  Not as huge as Van Halen, but he had a great following with the Red Rocker. 
[00:41:30]  Sammy Hagar, the Red Rocker.  And, you know, the songs he came up with, man, they're great, great songs.  But you don't...  I don't feel like...  This is where the whole argument starts.  Uh-oh.  I never felt like it was Van Halen, though.  Oh, man, good fucking guy.  I hate to say it.  I always felt like it was a Sammy Hagar band.  Yeah.  I never felt like it was a Van Halen band.  And now, you know, let's get some fucking drinks and fucking discuss this.  A couple of bands have done that, though, over the years. 
[00:42:00]  They, you know, we were talking about Journey.  The other...  Journey had their original singer.  Right.  And it was a different band.  And then Steve Perry made it, you know, Journey.  But there's still...  Right.  ...two incarnations of it.  I think...  Didn't the Moody Blues have something like that, too?  Probably.  I don't know, but...  Probably.  There were a few bands that had other singers completely different.  Jefferson Starship and then Jefferson Airplane.  Right.  There was Jefferson Airplane and then Jefferson Starship.  And then just Starship.  Starship.  And they got Mickey Thomas was his name, or Thompson.  And that was a completely different fucking band, but it was still... 
[00:42:30]  I don't know.  Sammy Hagar's vocals are so strong.  I just always felt like that was a Sammy Hagar band.  Yeah.  I mean, then with the Gary Cherone, you hear the Van Halen sound more.  Yeah, the Van Halen sound is there.  You know, even though Cherone's now trying to sound like Hagar because they had success with Hagar.  Yeah.  But when I think Van Halen, I do think of the original lineup with David Lee Roth.  Well, that's...  But the Hagar years, I loved.  I went to probably...  Honestly, I probably went to five or six of those shows easily.  But if you talk to people that were the age you were when you first got into Van Halen with David Lee Roth... 
[00:43:00]  It was just a fucking little nothing.  But if you talk to people that age when Hagar was there, they wouldn't even think about David Lee Roth.  Of course.  They'd be like, oh, Sammy Hagar's the singer of Van Halen.  Yeah, of course.  And then there was that other, you know, Pete Best guy that was there before.  Well, Hagar was there how many years?  Before they brought him back.  85 to 96.  Yeah, he was there a long time, 11 years.  And David Lee Roth was there... 
[00:43:30]  When did they start?  Around 75, I would guess.  72 to 85.  72?  They didn't really have...  When did the first album come out?  That was in the late 70s.  Yeah, the 72 is when they were really just getting back together, doing the wet t-shirt concert contest.  78, 79?  I was going to go...  First album, I would say, is right around that Boston first album.  The big hit.  75, 76.  Wow, you think that early?  I think.  I'm going fucking 70... 
[00:44:00]  I'm going 77, 78.  Wow.  Yeah.  Who's right?  Van Halen came out in 78.  Holy fucking A!  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So they did six years before they even had anything going on.  Right.  Six years of despising each other.  70.  And when did I say 75?  Yeah, that's crazy early.  A little too early.  75 was fucking Frampton Comes Alive and Boston.  Yeah.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Eagles.  Hotel California, shit like that.  Right. 
[00:44:30]  MTV tried to make such a big deal about Gary Cherone joining the band.  Uh-oh.  Like, this was the next thing.  Oh, the next incarnation.  Yeah, here it comes.  I remember they had a news special and Kurt Loder was talking about it and they premiered  the video.  I remember there was a lot of hope, but...  Oh, boy.  I mean, Extreme wasn't that successful.  No.  They had two massive fucking songs.  Because they had two hits that didn't sound anything like the rest of their songs.  And then a couple other songs that were good, but they weren't a huge fucking band meeting  with a big catalog. 
[00:45:00]  People bought their albums based on Wholehearted.  And what was the other one?  I don't even know the other one.  I know there was a second song.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  This is Wholehearted.  What was the other song?  Did they do More Than Words?  More Than Words.  More Than Words was the other one.  More Than Words was the other one.  What, you liked Extreme?  No, I just know them.  So they're two kind of mellow songs, you know.  They're melodic and shit.  And the rest of their album was like...  Pretty hardcore.  Yeah, them being hardcore and shit. 
[00:45:30]  So people are like, oh, I don't like that bit of music from them.  I enjoy this.  Right.  It was like when Sugar Ray came out.  Oh, right, yeah.  And their single sounded nothing like the rest of their album.  Yes.  So then the next album sounded like their first single.  Confusing everybody.  Yeah, they're like, fuck, this is what works.  This was a cool fucking song.  It's cool, the right word.  I don't know.  But I like this one.  This was in the era of the ballad.  The, you know, harmonic rocker ballad. 
[00:46:00]  And they did all right.  What's the harmonies?  What was the other guy's name?  Nuno.  Ah, Nuno Betancourt.  We had Nuno on a bunch of times with his solo projects and everything else.  Oh, my God.  It doesn't sound like Sammy Hagar here.  This is the best part of the whole extreme story.  I didn't know Wolverine was in the band. 
[00:46:30]  That guy all the way to the left.  The guy all the way to the left is, uh, had a lot of success with Godsmack.  Oh, really?  He was their manager or whatever.  I don't recognize him in that picture yet.  Yeah, we ran into him.  Godsmack's manager was in extreme?  Yeah, right?  Oh, interesting.  I didn't know that.  Now I'm losing my confidence in this because I haven't thought of this in a while.  No, yeah.  He became Godsmack's manager.  Really?  I believe the drummer of extreme. 
[00:47:00]  Somebody help me out.  It's been Figueroa.  Figueroa.  Figueroa.  I don't know.  Maybe it's the, uh...  Paul Geary?  Yeah, Paul.  Of course.  All right.  Paul Geary.  Paul Geary is the manager of Godsmack when they were hitting.  Damn.  Yeah, Paul...  We ran into Paul Geary a million times when we were at AAF.  That's Denver Pest, the always knowledgeable Denver Pest.  Yeah, he went on to fucking manage Godsmack. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah?  Yes.  And I'm like, you're the dude from extreme.  Get the fuck out of here.  I remember that.  Was he the drummer?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  I do remember him.  Yeah, Paul Geary.  Of course.  When Sully was just a local.  Coming to our gigs.  Sully Erna.  He loves Sully.  Missed that fucking guy. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  He comes around every once in a while.  Yeah.  All right.  Let me say hi to Bill in Pennsylvania.  Bill.  Oh.  Hey, guys.  Hey, man.  Oh, Bill.  Hey, after Gary Cherone left, they did a Best Of CD with three songs with Sammy, and they  went on tour in 04, and Sammy even said that Eddie wasn't in a good place, and they wanted  to continue the tour, but Eddie just couldn't do it, and he was drunk all the time, and whatnot. 
[00:48:30]  Right.  Yeah.  Well, that's when they...  Gee.  Then they brought, you know, Dave back in 07, so...  Yeah, and they've been kind of doing that thing for a while now, off and on.  And, you know, Sammy and Mikey went to Chicken Foot, so...  Right.  And they're having fun with that shit.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're very successful with Chicken Foot, so...  Well, I wouldn't say very successful with Chicken Foot.  But they're doing what they love.  We had Hagar in for a few of those projects. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, yeah.  Well, when he was pushing that Cabo fucking tequila.  Well, the Cabo Wobble tequila.  Oh, he sold...  He made almost, I think, $90 million selling that off.  He made a fucking fortune with that goddamn tequila.  That's why the Chicken Foot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now the big thing is they just come out with a line of rum.  Yeah.  I don't think it's going to be as successful.  No.  All right.  Tequila.  Tequila was pretty fucking good, actually.  All right, guys.  I enjoyed the Sammy Hagar's tequila. 
[00:49:30]  Isn't all tequila kind of the same?  I would like to say yes and don't want to sound like a snob and be like, but no.  I...  You know, Patron is fucking great.  I like that shit.  If you just get the big, tall, clear bottle of no-name tequila, it's so bad.  It really does make a difference.  And that's not...  I like Captain Morgan and Coke's.  They're great.  And if there's no Captain Morgan, someone goes, oh, here, try some of this, like, spiced  rum or try the Bacardi spice rum. 
[00:50:00]  It's like, no, it doesn't taste the same.  Does anyone really enjoy a shot of tequila?  It's part of the whole thing.  Just a question.  Patron is nice.  If you just...  Wait, do you actually enjoy it, Iraq?  Yes.  Okay.  Oh, shit.  The silver Patron is very good.  Damn.  You like tequila, huh, Iraq?  Like Anthony was saying, if you drink, like, Jose Cuervo or something, it doesn't taste as good.  No.  But if you get the silver Patron...  I think that's where my tequila experience ended.  Cuervo, huh?  I think I never moved past Cuervo.  Everyone was trying Cuervo as a kid. 
[00:50:30]  That's all I fucking drank as far as tequila.  Oh, God.  We should get some Patron.  Do some shots.  I'll do a shot in the morning.  Coke floats and Patron in my cup.  Oh, the stupid cold of mine is lingering.  I'll fucking do a shot of tequila.  That would work.  I'll try anything.  You know what?  You don't just grab tequila like you do with beer if you're around the house and it's nice and fucking warm outside.  But with the whole ritualistic thing, if you've got everything with the lime and the salt and a few buddies and you're drinking and you do some shots,  it tastes better because the whole thing is like a thing. 
[00:51:00]  It's just cool.  You know, it's fun to do.  You get some kind of cheap Mexican beer and then a shot of tequila.  Yeah, it's great.  Oh, Roland knows the thing.  He's rubbing his tummy.  Yum, yum.  Like Bob's dog just came in after hearing about tequila.  It's delicious.  Yeah.  It's cold.  Of course the Mexican is saying it's delicious.  Mexican.  After five shots, I'm like me to just bring it to the table.  Yeah?  You really like tequila?  I love tequila. 
[00:51:30]  Now, what does it do to you?  Does it get you fucking hammied?  I will run through water fountains.  Oh, right.  That was when you ran through the water fountain naked or something.  No, I'll run through water fountains anywhere if I get really tanked.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How often do you drink tequila?  Bus store brand new.  Is it a, oh boy.  Is it every weekend?  No.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Yeah.  No, yeah.  Special occasions.  Yeah.  What about Troy Kwan?  Does he partake also when you guys are out doing your guy things?  He did on Saturday. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, he did?  Really?  Oh.  He got fucked up.  Did he?  I mean, he went to the dark side.  Wow.  Really?  After the big food show?  After the big food show?  You guys all went and celebrated?  Troy's not a drinker, so like, he did a couple shots.  What were you drinking?  Everything.  Yeah, yeah, he did a couple shots and he started four.  You went out with them, too?  Yeah, we all went to Guy Fieri's spot.  Oh, that's right.  So he tweeted from that.  Hey.  He got all kinds of fucked up.  With the Cuban?  Yeah. 
[00:52:30]  Guy heard the show and said he wanted everybody to go back there and just have a great time.  Wow.  Did he really hear the show?  Yeah, he called the Cuban.  Really?  I talked to him for a minute, yeah.  That's pretty goddamn cool.  He put us on the chef's tab.  Yeah.  Damn!  We had food and drinks coming to the table.  It's like, literally, probably like, uh.  That's how you hook up a nigga.  20 drinks?  20 drinks just came out in one shot.  You know, it was a little much.  Yeah.  Because we kind of lost track of the fact that Roland's food court ended at 7 o'clock at  night.  It wasn't late. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, no.  So we go to the middle of Times Square, and by 8.30, everybody's plastered and just shouting  and slamming things and going nuts.  It's too early to be that drunk.  And there's families around.  Oh, no.  So, like, at first, they're like, yeah, save room for dessert.  We're going to blah, blah, blah.  And at the end, they had like, you know, we were full and everything.  But Troy goes, I think, are they going to do dessert?  And the waiter goes, uh, no, they actually closed the tab.  Oh, shit.  They wanted you out. 
[00:53:30]  Get the fuck out, you annoying people.  Yeah, I think, Troy, yelling rap lyrics, why there's a family of four behind them from  Wisconsin.  Oh, frightening the children.  That could be a problem.  And banging the table.  To be fair, it was the anniversary of Biggie's death.  Yeah.  Is Guy Fieri's place doing all right?  It was busy.  I don't know.  I think they went broke after we ate all their food.  You guys ate up that tab, huh?  Well, there's a couple things here.  I told Roland Off Air, I should tell him on air, I thought his food court was a really  good show.  I really did. 
[00:54:00]  I mean, that started out as a goof.  Rave reviews.  It started out as a goof, and I think you should do it once a month, once every two  months, something like that.  Definitely.  He's two for two.  I really liked it.  The Cuban, uh, you know, is hilarious.  The other guy you had from Iron Chef was really good, and then you fucking know how to control  a radio show, and you were ridiculously prepared.  You made me uncomfortable.  I'm like, I've never been that prepared for a radio show.  He had notes, and he knew exactly where he was going.  Wow.  He fucking controlled the room. 
[00:54:30]  It was, I was impressed as a radio guy.  I just said that girl's name, Sarma, I'm going to call her Sarah.  And he doesn't speak as mumbly?  Really?  Why is that?  I don't know.  I love food.  Because when he's, I don't know, when he's in charge, something else happens.  They had a vegetarian brought in, and they were beating the hell out of her the whole  fucking show.  So, but she was holding her own.  Yeah, she ran Bain Financial, Demi Romney, Hedge Fund.  Oh, Bain.  And then the other.  David Burke, he was.  And the other thing is, I decided to come in just to get out of the house and kind of 
[00:55:00]  support Roland.  So I was in E-Rock's booth.  Oh.  With my feet up.  Wow.  Troy was in there.  And who's the phone screener?  That guy's pretty cool.  Handsome Johnny Tubestakes.  Who does he work for?  SMU.  Can we move him over?  The names.  He's the one who laughed at your shit before.  I know.  Yeah, he laughed way more than Sal or any of the you fuckers.  You want me to talk to Rob about trading somebody out?  Yeah, let's move him over.  Let's move him over here.  Okay.  We could pick whoever the fuck we want. 
[00:55:30]  Okay.  Wow.  And then what happens?  Move Sal to XMU?  Yeah, yeah.  Let's make that trade immediately.  All right.  Move him over there.  Look, it happens all the time in the major leagues.  We fucking, we're going to trade.  Get traded.  I think Sal would do great at XMU.  Wow.  And we'll take him for Sal.  Yes.  We'll offer him a dick bag to be named later.  Yeah, we'll throw in somebody else.  We'll throw in an intern or something.  Yeah.  No, I like that kid, whoever he is.  Handsome Johnny Tubestakes.  Handsome Johnny Tubestakes, yeah.  Handsome Johnny Tubestakes. 
[00:56:00]  So, I'm over there.  The names.  I'm over there, and his show was supposed to be an hour, Roland's Food Court.  Yes, I heard this.  I heard about this.  My feet are up on the fucking console, and I'm like, who's coming in next?  And Sam tells me, E-Rock's got his show.  I'm like, you know what?  E-Rock was going to fucking surprise everyone.  I'm like, you know what?  This is going way too, way too good.  Oh, you made the call?  I go, if Roland wants, let's do another hour.  Oh, oh, E-Rock, Opie made that call.  And so, you were bumped. 
[00:56:30]  So, Roland did a two-hour show.  He was only scheduled to do one hour.  But Roland, yeah, and E-Rock was coming in to do the surprise show, right?  And Roland, as he's announcing, all right, yeah, we're going to do a second hour.  Yeah.  I can see down the hall, E-Rock has just gotten here to do his show, and with him are his guests.  Strong guests, too.  His best buddy, Giddles, who he wants to impress.  Giddles?  Who's Giddles?  Who's Giddles?  He's just a guy that E-Rock has a crush on. 
[00:57:00]  Do you like Giddles?  Oh, you got a man crush on Giddles?  E-Rock, who's Giddles?  He's my old roommate.  You guys just get along?  E-Rock and Giddles.  But Giddles has, like, he works in television.  Giddles in the morning.  He works in television?  Right, so E-Rock wants to impress him.  Ah.  Ah, look at me.  And he was like, oh, I'm going to have a show.  What does he do in television?  Giddles.  He's editing for various TV shows.  Really?  Oh, yeah?  I've never seen edited by Giddles in the credits.  Mm-hmm.  Giddles.  He did projects for Oprah.  How do you get the name, by the way? 
[00:57:30]  It's a play on his last name.  What?  What is it?  Giddles is his last name.  Ah, oi!  Giddles.  Yeah, that's cool.  Ah, just call me Giddles.  How about...  No.  His other guest?  Yeah.  The man with the worst luck in all of radio.  Pat Duffy.  Pat Duffy.  Oh.  Oh, man.  Thought he was going to get his break.  Again.  His big break on the show.  Right.  And he was bumped for Roland's food court.  I did feed him, though. 
[00:58:00]  Oh, you did?  Because we had tons of food.  Did you?  Yeah.  He wasn't here for the food.  That's fucking great.  Yeah.  Bumperoo.  Yeah, he got the old bumperoo.  Do you know how good a fucking name that is for a show?  Food court.  Food court's perfect.  Because it's like a food court.  Like, you go to a food court.  Or it's like you're holding court about food.  Oh, I know.  It's fucking a miracle name.  He knows his shit, too.  That's like Dirk Diggler.  Right.  I saw a food court in lights.  Right.  And it just exploded.  The name was so powerful.  Right.  It's great.  Roland knows his food, man. 
[00:58:30]  He's one of those foodies, for real.  Yeah.  He knows his shit.  Dude, you can make a lot of money.  Mmm.  We've been telling that for months, by the way.  When you start up a food blog about New York City, you got the built-in audience with us  so we could go, hey, don't forget about Roland's food blog.  Don't waste your breath.  Because a lot of people trying to fucking blog out there, they don't have the reach that  you have here.  No.  We've been having this conversation with them for the last six months.  You're ridiculous.  You could do all the food carts.  You could go Italian one week. 
[00:59:00]  You could go the best dessert, the best fucking burger, all that shit.  Easily.  He doesn't better himself.  It's too bad.  There's good pocket money there.  I'm telling you.  Travis was pointing out that it had to hurt E-Rock more because he was bumped by his hero.  Like his hero is the one that said, you know what?  Nah, Roland's doing a good job.  You sit out this one, kid.  Well, I mean, you know, I didn't purposely try to hurt E-Rock.  I just saw good radio in front of my eyes and said, we got to keep this going. 
[00:59:30]  Right.  Well, I mean, that implies that it was going to be better than what was going to happen.  Well, that means E-Rock should do one this weekend.  I told him he should take the two hours this weekend yesterday.  Yes.  E-Rock can't.  But now he's like, no.  Like he wants to swoop in secretly.  I know.  What is that?  That's why he lost the show because he was so noncommittal about it.  Because he was noncommittal and fucking secretive.  He wants to swoop in.  Swoop in and not let anyone know.  I laugh because you're so right.  I know.  Because he's got no confidence.  That's why. 
[01:00:00]  No confidence and he's mysterious at the same time.  He's always vague and mysterious.  So it was perfect for him.  I'm just going to sweep it.  I might do a show.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Maybe not.  Oh, E-Rock.  When are you going to swoop in next, E-Rock?  I don't know.  Soon.  See?  See?  He doesn't know.  It'll happen, though.  Soon.  It'll happen.  We never know. 
[01:00:30]  Of course not.  He's like the Caped Crusader.  That's right.  Or the masked man.  He said on Dave's show, first of all, Dave let the cat out of the bag that E-Rock, not  only does he want to start a podcast, he wants to start a whole Kevin Smith podcast network  all based on his stuff.  While he's writing a movie?  Yeah.  That's crazy.  That's too much.  And producing a radio show.  And he said on Dave's show, he's already done like four podcasts that he just hasn't  put out.  What?  Why aren't you putting them out? 
[01:01:00]  If it's a podcast and no one hears it, is it really a podcast?  Uh-huh.  True.  Uh-huh.  E-Rock?  I'm getting a website built and then I'll put them out.  It's all the tools.  And then you've got to just put the content out and let them out.  How about you don't know what the fuck you're talking about, what involves with this, so  keep your mouth shut.  Oh!  I don't know what I'm talking about.  It's about time someone slept, Sam.  I'm on E-Rock's side for this one.  Oh, yeah.  We're all behind E-Rock now.  What else you got?  E-Rock.  I know exactly what I'm talking about.  So you're saying you don't know what he's talking about. 
[01:01:30]  A guy that has a podcast that's on iTunes and has a set time that he does it.  Yeah, but you're just a podcaster.  He's like the guy running the show.  I have a show, too.  Do you have a network?  No, I think one is sufficient.  E-Rock is going to build a network.  The E-Rock network.  That's where the real money is.  That is.  But don't you think if there was an audience that was built by just starting to put podcasts  out and then you built a website around that, that they would be there?  Why are you asking us?  Ask E-Rock.  E-Rock. 
[01:02:00]  He's the expert on podcasting.  E-Rock.  The ones that are pre-recorded aren't ready to go out yet.  What are they waiting on?  They're finished being produced.  The following E-Rock broadcast has been pre-recorded.  What do you mean they're post-production?  Take it aside.  Keep taking it aside.  No, because this isn't what your typical podcast is as far as...  Oh!  Brand new fucking business model.  He's reinventing the podcast.  I like it.  I like it.  Reinventing the podcast.  Because everyone can do a podcast.  Yeah.  Stupid Sam does one. 
[01:02:30]  You're right.  E-Rock.  And basically he's saying you're doing a podcast like everyone else.  It's just a mic plugged into a computer.  There's no post-production.  E-Rock is saying, nope.  E-Rock.  I'm going to show you what this thing can do.  You're coming tight.  E-Rock.  Go ahead, E-Rock.  I'm back on E-Rock's side.  Well, this particular one that has some episodes already done, they're not time sensitive.  They go along with something else.  So those are being produced.  Sam's just bursting into laughter.  Because he doesn't know shit about what's going on.  He's laughing at you.  Nobody does, because you're being vague.  Because I wasn't ready to give all the info out yet. 
[01:03:00]  He's never ready to give the info on anything.  Of course he's not.  Because these assholes think, oh, we need to tell everybody before it's done.  What could he possibly be waiting for?  Not you.  Oh!  It's unbelievable, this E-Rock.  I don't know what that means.  I love this E-Rock.  I don't think anybody thought you were waiting for me.  E-Rock.  Oh, E-Rock.  You know damn well you've got to put the podcast out there before you can get a network,  because no one's going to tune in.  I never even said a network. 
[01:03:30]  That wasn't even my speak.  I heard network.  I heard network.  That was from Sam.  You don't have four shows that you're working on?  I have four of them, yeah.  That's a network.  That's a network.  That's Kevin Smith.  Are they hosted by you?  All of them?  All of them.  And you're writing a movie?  Sal's laughing.  Sal's laughing.  Sal's laughing.  His last day with the Opie and Anthony show before the big trade.  He's having a good time.  Or we could just release him like the Jets are going to release Tim Tebow.  Oh.  You're a free agent.  Mm-hmm.  Do you want to be released or traded, Sal? 
[01:04:00]  I want to stay here.  I don't want to be.  No, that's not an option.  I'm sorry.  A lot of players want to stay.  I know.  I remember.  I'm sure Tim Tebow wants to keep that Jet uniform on.  He wouldn't mind.  Nice fucking paycheck.  Right.  Yeah, you're not staying.  But you could either be released, meaning you're fired, and maybe another organization will pick you up.  Or we'll do a trade.  I'm excited about this Sal trade.  I am too, yeah. 
[01:04:30]  I like the tube sticks guy.  It's a good move.  It's a good move, right, Roland?  Yeah, we hung out with him at guys.  Yeah.  It was a good hit.  You rock.  When will the big reveal happen?  When do you think it'll be ready?  Soon.  Soon as I have the server and the website done.  I've seen E-Rock's setup at his house.  Oh, you have?  In the basement.  It's nice.  E-Rock, you got a setup?  Oh, yeah.  It's actually really nice.  I'm trying, yeah. 
[01:05:00]  I think that's where his new avatar picture comes from.  Yep.  Where he's in front of a microphone with his eyes up.  Can I see it?  Yes.  Please?  Oh, wait, no.  He changed his avatar.  Oh, you changed it again?  Yeah.  Why?  Why?  Because I found something else I liked.  Who changes their avatar that much?  You're giving it much too much thought.  Hold on.  Let me see if I have the other one.  That's much too much thought behind,  Hey, my avatar, what is it?  I changed mine for the first time and people lost their minds because I guess they were  used to the old one.  You know what it is?  When you're scrolling through a bunch of things, you just go with a visual reference. 
[01:05:30]  I know.  So a lot of times you do just notice someone's avatar.  I might have messed it up by changing mine.  Yeah, you got to keep it the same.  Yeah.  People kind of know that.  It's not like the beginning of a 70s sitcom where every year they kind of switched it  up a little.  Yeah, I like that.  Yeah.  I didn't mind when they switched it up.  I didn't mind either.  Iraq, what is the podcast going to be about?  Iraq.  Geek-ish?  Geek stuff?  Well, the one that's already pre-recorded is going to be a companion piece to...  Iraq, come on!  ...to something I know a lot about, and that would be The Simpsons. 
[01:06:00]  So that's a specific niche podcast.  Oh, so one podcast about The Simpsons.  Simpsons.  Okay.  That's the one that's been pre-recorded.  Now, does this go with your movie thing where you go back in time to where people gave a  flying fuck about The Simpsons?  No.  Oh, okay.  I thought it was part of the movie.  People still care.  What?  What?  Yes.  They do.  They do?  They do. 
[01:06:30]  Do they?  Yeah.  So that's one of them.  Then, you know, the second one will be, like, what Sam says everyone does.  You can do it once a week.  You plug in.  Talk about, you know, things going on in your life, et cetera.  So that one will be there.  Oh, just kind of, yeah, kick back.  Hey.  Why do you feel like...  Sorry.  Why do you feel like you need four podcasts?  Why wouldn't you have one podcast, and then, like, one of the features would be a Simpsons,  like, feature?  Because the Simpsons one is different from the others.  But it's you. 
[01:07:00]  Each episode, each week's episode pertains to a specific episode of The Simpsons.  So it's the E-Rock director's commentary of The Simpsons.  Oh, I like that.  But are you going to play episodes of The Simpsons?  They're involved with the podcast, yes.  Oh, so you're going to get sued.  Wait, wait, wait.  Okay, so you're going to get a cease and desist.  Which is fun.  Of course.  Maybe not.  They took down my broadcast once for the compound when I did a simulcast of the World Series.  Oh, do they really?  Yeah, because I was actually, I had the entire visual and sound of Major League Baseball up 
[01:07:30]  on the screen, and I was commenting on it, and apparently they frown on that.  I never heard Major League Baseball say anything about the fact that they don't like you rebroadcasting  their stuff.  Never heard it.  No.  They should announce that or something.  They should absolutely announce that every day.  Yes.  It is very strange.  But E-Rock's got four, so we got the two.  Oh, we only got two.  We got the Simpsons, and we got the one which is like, hey, I'm E-Rock.  This is what's happened in my life.  Let me tell you what happened yesterday in the world of E-Rock. 
[01:08:00]  So what's the other two?  And are you going to be able to talk about the fact that you spent the day watching The  Simpsons if it's not a Simpsons podcast?  Can you mention The Simpsons in that other podcast?  Will you be cross-promoting your podcast?  Of course.  Oh.  All right, what's the other two?  The other one, the third one, involves me and some friends from growing up.  Giggles?  It's Gittles, Ant.  Oh.  Will Gittles be part of it?  No, Giggles is part of the Simpsons one.  He's not part of the other one.  But isn't he a guy you grew up with? 
[01:08:30]  He is.  So he could be part of the other one.  But he didn't make the cut with the one with the guys you grew up with?  With the, hey, I'm E-Rock.  He's a busy guy.  He doesn't have enough time.  All right, so the guys that he grew up with, so what are you going to talk about there?  Things in their life and-  Wait, that isn't the-  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  No, he's got a Simpsons podcast.  Okay.  He's got the E-Rock podcast.  E-Rock podcast.  Where it's like, hey, I'm E-Rock.  Right.  And then he's got one with his pals that he grew up with.  Wait a minute.  That's the E-Rock one.  That's what I'm thinking.  Now I'm getting confused.  How do you-  Because we sit here. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  And let's say that us talking about our life, we'll talk about like, oh man, like Opie talks  about a story about, you know, his kid and everything and what's happening now.  But it could easily take a tangent to when we were kids and like, oh, I remember when  my mom would do something like this instead of-  So it kind of, how do you separate, do you have a line that you're not allowed to cross  as far as years go?  Do you go like, hey, hey, hey, this is the E-Rock podcast.  Don't you go into like years ago.  Why not for the E-Rock podcast, you bring in the guys you brought, you grew up with every 
[01:09:30]  once in a while.  And they could talk about E-Rock.  Yeah.  Well, I did want to try doing it as a one person perspective, sort of like what Sam does,  what Bill Burr does, those kind of things.  Oh, so you're just, so the E-Rock one is just E-Rock.  Yeah.  So then the one with your buddies is E-Rock and his buddies.  Mm-hmm.  And now we have one left.  Yes.  It's like when Adam Ferrara comes on this show.  Yeah.  It's not-  It's not the Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  No, it's different.  Opie and Anthony and the buddies they grew up with.  This is so vague.  The lines between these podcasts are so gray. 
[01:10:00]  Right.  They're so-  Well, the fourth one might bring it all together.  All right, E-Rock.  Can I give a secret podcasting tip?  Yes.  Nobody listens to podcasts with just one person unless you're Bill Burr.  Trust me.  Oh, man.  It's rough.  Is that why?  Numbers are a little weak.  Hence putting Jess on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now you're ripping off Rich and Bonnie.  Oh, man.  It's an exercise in futility.  I don't even know why I do it.  All right.  And the fourth podcast? 
[01:10:30]  The fourth one, I-  Oh, boy.  Come on, E-Rock.  Don't you fail out now.  He saved the best for last, though.  That one's going to be ruined.  Don't fail out now.  Don't fail out now.  Come on.  Fourth podcast.  All right.  The fourth one is a little-  It's industry related.  What?  It's speaking to people in radio, past and present.  Oh.  The radio one.  Yeah.  Radio on the radio.  Yeah.  What's bad about that?  Yeah.  Why was that bad?  His guest list. 
[01:11:00]  That's almost the one that kind of makes sense.  You got Cowhead, and then who else?  No.  Oh.  You know-  Skittles?  Brucey?  Skitties?  Can I tell you who he has?  Skitties or Skittables?  Skivvies?  Who's on that one?  Eric, do you mind if I tell them?  No.  Go ahead, because you don't know the whole guest list, but-  No, I just know-  I know very few people, but he has Rob Cross to be on his podcast.  Oh, my God.  Chuck Roast.  Hey, Chuck Roast.  He worked at K-Rock in L.A.  Wow.  Fascinating.  Look out.  What'd he do for them? 
[01:11:30]  Opie, has he asked you?  Huh?  Has he asked you?  He will eventually.  I know he will.  Imagine that.  But he wants to start-  You score fucking Opie on your show.  With Rob Cross.  He's a successful radio guy.  Rob Cross.  What did he do for K-Rock L.A.?  That's the launch show.  What did he do?  Be honest.  That's the launch show.  Right.  What did he do?  He was the music director.  Oh.  Jesus.  Okay.  And then what?  And then he worked over at K-Rock in New York. 
[01:12:00]  They brought him over here.  What did he do for K-Rock in New York?  You're spoiling the whole podcast here.  Isn't this the thrilling stuff that's going to be-  What kind of story could Rob Cross have for your podcast?  I haven't done it yet.  I don't know.  That's what you find out, Opie.  You weave through the story.  That's true.  Fair enough.  You know, some people prepare like Roland.  Other people, you wing it.  You just get a-  When you have a Rob Cross on your show, you don't have to prepare. 
[01:12:30]  And you can't.  No.  And are these going to be weekly podcasts?  Because people like having a schedule.  Those are going to be special editions.  What?  Those come out as they get done.  Which ones?  The radio industry one.  Oh.  Just that one?  But the other one?  All the three podcasts you're going to do weekly?  Yeah.  The others are weekly.  I cannot wait for the E-Rock podcast.  He's going to do them weekly.  And you can spell that any way you please.  Oh, E-Rock.  But then the question is, like, why wouldn't you want to at least start doing shows on 
[01:13:00]  the channel with the audience?  Well.  Yeah.  That's a great question.  You're going to reach so many more people here than you would from your basement.  There's some of those things I can't do here.  Yeah.  But like-  Why not?  Because they won't let me do that.  Who said-  We tell you what you can and can't do.  And I don't mean that in a dicky way.  I'm just saying, like-  The radio industry one I can't do here because then there's a lot of people who can't do  the interviews because it's airing on here because of other companies and things like 
[01:13:30]  that.  Yeah, but you can be your general-  But you've got four podcasts.  And then the Simpsons one you can't do here because if you're broadcasting the episode  or whatever, that's going to be a problem too.  That'd be a problem.  Wait, you're going to broadcast the entire Simpsons episode?  No, but you can't do a half an hour set-up piece to go with the episode that you're  watching while doing it on here.  Why couldn't you?  He is so flustered in there.  Watch out.  You just don't want to be in front of a bigger audience. 
[01:14:00]  What are you talking about?  We play TV clips all the time.  Yeah, you're playing TV clips, but when you're doing-  But we asked you if you're playing the whole episode.  You said no.  So then that would mean you're playing clips.  You're doing the commentary to the entire episode, but you're not playing the entire  episode over the air.  It's one of those things.  You start here, and then we break it down.  Like what we did for Back to the Future.  Is that what you're saying?  Yes.  Yes.  So the episode will be playing, and then you'll pull it down in the mix and talk about it 
[01:14:30]  a little?  Yeah, and we tell you things that you may not know about the people that appeared in there,  some of the production things that they've done with it.  Just watch a draft like that.  Are you going to go old school, Simpsons?  It's only the first 10 years.  That's it.  Only 10 years!  He's priceless.  He's priceless.  I love you.  I love E-Rod.  Only the first 10 years. 
[01:15:00]  Only the first decade.  He always comes up with doozies.  It's a little Lulu.  I love you, brother.  Oh, E-Rod.  It's only the first 10 years.  You should at least start doing the general one or the buddy's one on the channel.  Sure.  The Sunday show I do, it's just on a Sunday afternoon, and it gets so many more listeners  than a dumb podcast.  Right.  Why are you doing both?  Me?  Yeah.  Just because I think for branding purposes...  You've got to keep your feet in the water.  Just to have...  You've just got to have a podcast out there. 
[01:15:30]  I don't care if nobody listens to it, just to say that there is one.  It's there.  I've got a whole box of podcast equipment for Christmas that's just still sitting there.  Well, you don't need it for branding as much as I do.  No.  Well, I have an idea.  I just want to do family stories for my brothers.  But I've got to figure out the logistics of that.  I don't know if I want to do it weekly, either.  That would be a pain in the ass.  You can do the channel.  Huh?  You can put it on the E-Rock Network.  No.  E-Rock's going to fucking...  See if you can get a gig.  Get a gig on the E-Rock Network.  But I would bring it to our channel, obviously. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  I would use my podcast equipment to go fucking do the stories, and then, you know, I would  fucking edit it, you know, and bring the good shit here.  I've got to plug my shit back in.  Yeah, what happened to your shit?  I've got to get back on there.  Well, I was upgrading, and then the power failure happened, so I had to, like, scavenge  the studio for extension cords and fucking plugs and everything.  Right.  And then I just never got the upgrades and everything back online, but I've got to knock 
[01:16:30]  that out.  You see how you guys shit on E-Rock, but he's motivating us all to be more creative.  That is true.  That's right.  Because if I could get on that E-Rock Network...  Yeah, is there a spot for us, E-Rock?  E-Rock?  There'll always be a spot.  Oh, nice.  I want to be in between the E-Rock talking about E-Rock and the E-Rock's friends talking  about E-Rock show.  Just break it up a little.  Really?  Yeah.  But you're not someone he grew up with.  Well, that's just it.  So you're not allowed to be part of that show. 
[01:17:00]  No, I want to be in between those for two broadcasters.  Oh, I got you.  Like a little buffer between the two shows.  So you can make the E-Rock sandwich.  Right.  But you'd have to talk about your experiences working with E-Rock.  That would be a good show.  That's mandatory.  It's part of the contract he gives you.  That would be part of the E-Rock show.  No, that would be a separate show.  Oh, see, I'm so confused by the E-Rock Podcast Network.  You can't complicate these podcasts.  You have to have one thing that you're talking about only.  E-Rock talking about, like, meat martinis.  E-Rock?  Right.  Steak martini. 
[01:17:30]  That's a whole show.  That's a show.  That's a show.  That goes into Roland's food court territory.  E-Rock's whole life is gluttony.  It's not good enough to just have one podcast.  It's not good enough to have one ad food group here.  Why does it always have to be more and more and more for you, E-Rock?  Why does it always have to be miserable and say, you know, you can only do one?  Well, it's not miserable and only do one.  It's more logical, I think.  It makes more sense to put all your energy into one podcast. 
[01:18:00]  Right.  I think you're focusing on the Kevin Smith model, but I don't know how well that works for people.  Like, you could have one strong podcast where you're like, hey, man, it's me, it's my life,  and then I'm bringing in my friends this week because we got cool stories from growing up,  and then you know what?  We're going to go over here for a little while, and we're going to do a little Simpsons action.  Why not?  And just have one big, huge, powerful podcast.  I think you water it down when you have too many, and then the listeners can't figure out how to follow along. 
[01:18:30]  I'd be listening and going like, I'm hearing E-Rock, but now is this the Simpsons?  Right.  Or is this the radio industry show?  Right.  I don't know.  Comment.  Just to say this week, we're going to talk about this Simpsons episode, so that's what we're doing.  Right.  That's the beauty of it.  That's what E-Rock's podcast is this week is the Simpsons, but next podcast might not be.  And then there's less pressure on you.  Yeah.  Because then you're like, you know what?  My life this week wasn't that great. 
[01:19:00]  I don't have much to talk about.  So you know what?  Guess what?  I could do the Simpsons this week.  Right.  I got it in the can already.  And then my friends, they're all busy this week, so fuck, I can't do that podcast, so  I'll go back to the Simpsons again.  Now, doesn't that make sense?  E-Rock, come you?  Just wait until they come out.  Oh!  Just wait!  We're looking at the next Steve Jobs.  He's right there in our mist.  Damn.  All right, we're going to break, I guess.  Yeah.  How do you follow that? 
[01:19:30]  I don't know.  I love how Sam just laughs.  Sam's laughing at you.  Yeah.  This whole thing is, do it like I do it or why try?  Oh, shit.  No, it's not.  Just do it.  You just do it.  You don't talk about doing it.  You do it.  You don't buy equipment and talk about what I'm going to do.  You just do it.  That's my whole thing.  Post-podcast right now is in post-production.  Post.  That's what I'm talking about.  You just do it.  What needs to be done in post-production with the podcast you've already done? 
[01:20:00]  Good question.  Thank you.  There's some production being built for that show.  Like what?  Like an intro, outro, some wraparound stuff.  Oh.  Oh, look at that.  What kind of wraparounds?  We'll have to wait until it comes out.  Oh, God.  We always got to wait.  Everything's a waiting thing.  Wait, wait, wait with E-Rock.  It's wait and wait.  It's always wait with E-Rock.  Whether it has a G-H in it or not.  Yeah, we got it.  Yeah, we got it. 
[01:20:30]  I want E-Rock to be successful.  Yes.  And I want E-Rock to do it his way.  Of course.  But I want him to do it.  To just do it.  Right.  You don't think he's going to do it?  No.  Why?  Because he just talks about it.  Oh, man.  It's the same way we tell Roland, you got to do a food blog.  Oh, yeah, I'm going to do a food blog.  And then it doesn't happen.  Right.  There's just opportunities that are just not.  It's a blog.  You're saying, don't just talk the talk.  Right.  You got to walk the walk.  Or no one wants to listen to Sam.  Either one.  Oh, man.  Shit.  Holy shit.  That came out of nowhere. 
[01:21:00]  I know, because it didn't mean anything.  I don't understand.  It's very difficult to bash the guy that actually puts on a podcast about podcasting.  I mean, it could be sucky.  It could be that.  No one could be what.  The thing is, it's hard to say, fuck you, to the guy that actually is doing it, though.  That's all I'm saying.  I didn't say it was good.  I said I'd do it.  And then you responded by saying, yeah, well, you do it.  Right.  Like, if I have one listener, it's more than you, because you don't do it.  Oh, man.  Mine isn't out yet. 
[01:21:30]  That would be my point.  When's it going to be out, E-Rock?  Soon.  It's a lot of vague.  I love the vagary of E-Rock.  Could you give us more than soon?  He's been so vague for years.  Could you give us more than just soon?  No.  I love it.  He goes, no.  Oh, my God.  I was like, fuck you.  I love when E-Rock goes, fuck you, to me.  I love it.  It's the best thing ever.  He's going to do a good job.  It's going to be successful.  When he does stuff on the channel, rarely, it ends up being good. 
[01:22:00]  People like it.  Yeah.  We're the ones that are in his way.  You know that.  We kill his confidence.  You kill my confidence.  I just do it anyway.  No, we don't.  You destroy me every day.  Oh, you see the wink in my eye, though, idiot.  Of course.  E-Rock has never seen the wink in my eye.  All he's got to do is open him and look.  The funny part is, though, my point is, then I hear E-Rock outside the show, and I feel  like it's a completely different person.  I question myself, like, that's E-Rock, right? 
[01:22:30]  The one we know.  I think that's E-Rock.  That's the guy.  I got blown my nose.  Let's take a break.  We're back.  We've been away for a long, long, long, long time. 
[01:23:00]  We've been through changes.  We've played some games.  The more things change, the more things stay the same.  The more things stay the same, I say.  We're a little bit older, the way we're gliders.  We're back.  We're better than ever.  We're back.  We're back.  Together forever.  We're back.  We're back.  Hey, this is David Lee Roth. 
[01:23:30]  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:24:00]  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show.  That's me in the corner.  Out of time, 22 years ago by R.E.M.  Wow.  That was a big album for the band.  Bigger.  It's bigger than you.  New one.  R.E.M., yes or no?  Thumbs up, thumbs down.  Where you at, Ed? 
[01:24:30]  Used to hate R.E.M.  I like their songs.  I like some of their songs.  Yeah.  Like which ones?  This one's pretty good.  Everybody hurts.  Yeah, this one's kind of good.  I used to really like R.E.M.  Not so much as the years have gone by.  Corner.  Not R.E.M.  Day, though.  No, no, no.  We're not doing R.E.M.  Day.  No.  We've got to save our music days for special, special stuff.  Indeed. 
[01:25:00]  Well, it's James Taylor's birthday, 65.  Oh, 65.  That's a big age.  We should maybe do James Taylor Day.  Oh, wow.  And put everyone to sleep out there.  Exactly.  Too much.  That poor bastard.  He was fucking, in the 70s, you couldn't fucking imagine the amount of pussy that threw  themselves at James Taylor.  And then, like.  Man, every time I just even hear the name James Taylor, I go back to the time. 
[01:25:30]  And I know I've told a story.  I went through the whole story here today.  But the time, me and Buzzy, when the Opster was dabbling in the cocaine a little bit.  Oh.  Back in the late 80s, maybe early 90s.  And we went to a James Taylor show, and we had great seats because of CMF, the station  I worked for.  And we fucking showed up fucking just high on coke.  And it's a mellow fucking show.  Yes.  He's singing this.  That's a coke artist.  And we're thinking we're singing Metallica. 
[01:26:00]  We're out of our minds.  Grinding your teeth.  Grinding our teeth.  Fucking just being way too loud and way too excited about the show as everyone's just  kind of sitting back in their seats.  And everyone.  I know.  And it wasn't the paranoia.  Everyone was staring at us like, look at these two assholes.  This is the concert you pass around.  The wine satchel, man.  I know, I know, man.  And some doobs.  I know, I know.  I don't know who this is to my level.  But take a swig off of this wine satchel. 
[01:26:30]  Dude, we showed up late because we were too busy partying.  Just marching down the aisle as he's in the middle of a fucking song.  And just like, woo!  We were those assholes.  We were those assholes.  We couldn't stay seated.  I think we only saw two songs on how to get out of there.  Yeah, you're not on your feet at a James Taylor show.  Oh, we were in the wrong mindset for James Taylor that day.  I know you were, oh.  Boom, boom. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  Oh, thanks, man.  Let me.  Thank you.  Thank you.  What's your name, man?  Oh, boom, boom, boom.  Boom, boom, boom.  I just can't remember.  But then I went to the outdoor venue up there in Rochester, the Finger Lakes Performing Arts Center for another James Taylor show.  Yeah.  Brought this girl that I really liked at the time.  That's what you do.  And she was the one that blew me off for Blackie.  Uh-oh.  That doesn't sound good to me at all.  Blackie from, um, who ended up in, uh, with fucking Bob Saget there. 
[01:27:30]  What's his name?  Oh.  But he was Blackie on the soap opera.  Blackie on General Hospital at the time.  I got, I got blown off.  Wow.  She said, see you to the opster and went with Blackie.  John Stamos.  Yeah, she, uh, ended up, um, dating John Stamos back in the day.  Nah, what are you going to do?  I lost a chick to John Stamos.  That's not as bad as losing someone to, you know, someone lesser.  I mean, you got to figure, for the girl, that's like.  It kind of hurt.  That's like a fucking.  I was just a part-time radio DJ in Rochester, New York. 
[01:28:00]  But she went down to New York City for whatever and ended up, uh, hanging with, uh, John Stamos  for a while.  Oh, man.  I really liked this girl for a while.  She made the, uh, Hawaiian Tropic, um, Girls Magazine thing.  Really?  Yeah.  And she was in Cosmo.  You had to know you weren't going to hold on to that.  You know what, though?  I've tried to, I've tried to see, uh, uh, find this stuff online.  I can't find it.  No?  So I can show you.  She, uh. 
[01:28:30]  I can prove that I, I knew this, this girl at the time.  You banged her?  Or were you working on it?  Honestly, I mean, I could just say yes.  Yeah, I know.  I got some, I got some things done.  Some action.  I got some action.  Oh, shit.  I'll tell you, I'll tell you, I felt so out of my league with this girl.  Yeah.  I could finally say it.  You're like, oh boy.  I'm like, how, why the fuck is this girl with me?  And I took her to the James Taylor show and she really liked me.  And I was, I just went into panic mode.  And she was way hotter than me. 
[01:29:00]  Well, apparently so.  She went.  Because I'm hot, god damn it.  Apparently so.  No, I just, it was one of those girls, I just felt completely out of my league.  Yeah.  And I was doing everything just knowing at any moment I was going to blow it.  Yeah.  And I obviously did.  But she, I guess she saw the weakness in my eyes at the time and I was done.  She saw you were intimidated, nervous.  Right.  She smelled the fear.  Right.  And went off to John Stamos.  And then she came back to Rochester and I was still like, my heart was still like for her. 
[01:29:30]  Oh.  But then I think I moved to, yeah, because then her and Stamos didn't work out.  And then she, then I ran into her again.  And I was really happy to see her.  But then at that point I was moving on to Buffalo, I guess.  And that's sort of how it all just kind of fell apart.  Take a hike, bitch.  Yeah, man.  You're damaged goods.  I'll give her, I'll give you her name there, Sam, so you can look her up.  But I have looked over the years and I just can't see her shit online anymore.  You should just throw the name out and have the listeners look.  Nah.  No?  No, because I don't care about anybody. 
[01:30:00]  I swear over, like, the amount of time that's gone by that E-Rock wants to pay attention  to The Simpsons.  Like, that's my whole thing.  Ten years.  I used to mention a girl by name in some stories we told, especially at NEW.  Yeah.  Fucking got a call from her family, like, look, man, we'd really appreciate it if you  don't mention her name anymore.  Really?  Yeah.  What was her name?  I don't know what to say.  I said, no worries.  No worries.  Every once in a while you get one of those. 
[01:30:30]  So.  I just fucking lord it out.  Did you ever feel like you were completely out of your league with a girl?  A couple of times.  It's a bad place to be.  A couple of times.  Everything you do, you're just, like, complete, you're just focused and just praying that she  doesn't see the, you know, the weakness.  Oh, you just, first of all, you just know you're going to lose her anyway.  You're trying to hold on to her like a fucking big ball of mercury.  You're fucking, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Because I was, I mean, to this day I still am, but especially back then, I was, what, 
[01:31:00]  early 20s or whatever?  I was so fucking immature still.  Like, ridiculously immature for my age.  We've seen the pictures.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The stupid kid in the Coke shirt.  Oh, the Coke shirt.  Was trying to hold on to a 10.  That was only a few weeks away from blowing that kid off to go hang out with John Stamos,  who was a fucking soap opera star already. 
[01:31:30]  Yes, that's what I'm talking about.  There's the visual.  Coke shirts on my back.  Coke shirts on my back.  There's the visual.  That kid was trying to hang on to a, like a, a 10 that was actually, you know, doing a  little modeling and made some publications.  Oh, no.  That kid.  How did I, how did that kid get her?  That Coke shirt.  Of course it wasn't going to work out.  Oh.  I don't even have a hint of a muscle yet.  Oh, my God.  I'm 22 in that, in that video.  You couldn't grow the big fucking German, German U-boat commander beard back then. 
[01:32:00]  No.  Fuck no.  No way.  No.  Pfft.  Whatever.  That's something.  How long, uh.  I made good, though.  How long did you actually get to hang out with this chick?  It was, uh, officially one of those summer things.  A summer thing, yeah.  It was awesome.  Some of those summer fucking romances were the best.  And then just fucking John Stamos.  Well, fall comes around and just fucks everything up.  Yeah.  People have to go back to school or wherever.  Go back to school.  Or whatever the fuck. 
[01:32:30]  I know.  There was some girl fucking, I had a great summer with her, and she went  to Quinnipiac College.  That was it.  That was it, right?  That's when she told me, don't, um, don't just drop by.  Could you call before you come up?  Oh, my God.  I had one of those.  Um, yeah, don't just, you know, drop by.  Ah, just want to, you know, I want to make sure everything, yeah, really?  Yeah.  I want to make sure a dick isn't in your mouth when I fucking open the dorm door.  You fucker.  I had, uh, another one, uh, it was a Long Island summer romance. 
[01:33:00]  Now I'm back home.  That was mine.  This was, wait, no, this was before I had moved on with my radio.  Wait, was it?  I was in college, I guess.  Yeah.  I was 20, probably around 22, and she was like 17 or 18.  And we had, uh, 18.  And we, uh, had one of those summer romances, went to Montauk, all that shit.  A lot of, a lot of beaches and all this stuff.  Romance.  And then stupid fall comes around and ruins it.  She goes up to Boston and go to college.  And stupid me, where am I at that time? 
[01:33:30]  Uh, I might be back in Rochester, maybe, doing radio.  Trying to remember the timetable here.  And I did what you just said.  I just showed up.  Yeah.  Because we had a lot of friends that moved to Boston.  So I'm in Boston.  That doesn't work.  And I'm like, I'm going to fucking look up my summer romance.  Like, we never really split up, and we were kind of keeping in touch, but it was sort of weird and vague, because it was before cell phones, you know?  But you just assume things are still cool.  And, uh, I showed up where she lived, and I called her.  I'm like, hey, man, I'm in Boston.  Love to see you. 
[01:34:00]  And she would not invite me to her room, and I had to meet her in the, uh, in the common area.  In the common.  And we talked for an hour, and that whole hour, I'm just wondering when it's going to be like, hey, let's go get a bite to eat.  Hey, let's go have a couple drinks.  Hey, you want to see my dorm room?  Something.  No.  You're done.  It never came.  You're done.  And then it was the awkward, like, well, it was really good seeing you.  Bye.  And then I'm just standing in this common area in this dumb dorm in the middle of Boston going, I am the biggest fucking loser. 
[01:34:30]  I had no idea that she obviously moved on and obviously had some kind of boyfriend.  Oh, man.  But she didn't want to tell me.  She officially never told me.  That's what happens.  You fucking bitches.  It's the bitches that are geeks.  And then she transferred to, um, which one?  Yours?  Yeah.  To a Dowling in Oakdale.  Right?  Yeah.  Down in Oakdale, Long Island.  Right.  And, uh, it was even closer.  And, uh, I was like, oh, I could come down.  Now it's going to work out nice.  No. 
[01:35:00]  No.  You should, you know, I'll, yeah, I'll call you and I'll come up by you.  She probably had like fucking pictures of her boyfriend in her dorm room.  Didn't want me to see him.  Didn't want her fucking friends.  Didn't want her, her little dorm mates to be like, why is there another guy?  Hey, where's your boyfriend?  Well, uh, right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was, it was done.  And then, you know, all these stories have been told, but then I got to tell the, uh,  I got to finish my trifecta.  So then I, when I was in college, my senior year, I, I was going out with this girl who 
[01:35:30]  was from Rochester.  We, we went out for a couple of years there and she, she ended up moving to Boston with  a bunch of people.  A lot of Geneseo people moved to Boston.  She was one of them.  I stayed behind.  I was supposed to go to Boston, but I really believed in the radio career and I knew it  was not going to happen in Boston.  So I, I stayed behind as all these people are in Boston having the times of their lives  and me and Buzzy would take the weekend trips there to see all our pals and just party and  all that.  We did the Rochester to Boston trip so many times.  I can't even count. 
[01:36:00]  And, uh, and I showed up and she was living in Cape Cod and I'm in Boston.  I'm like, man, I can't wait to see you.  And it was all that vague shit again.  Cause we didn't have the cell phone.  But she goes, all right, yeah, great.  Come, come see me.  You know, you know, I'll, I'll pick you up.  So I took a train or a bus there.  I forget exactly at this point.  And I had my bag and she opened up the trunk of her fucking car and there were the size.  I swear to you, size fucking 14, 15 sneakers in her trunk. 
[01:36:30]  I'm like, that's not good.  And I just knew.  And we hung out for the day.  I think I spent the night and that was pretty much the last time I ever saw her.  I just fucking knew.  I'm like, holy shit.  You got a fucking boyfriend and you didn't even fucking tell me.  Oh boy.  That one hurt a lot.  That one hurt a lot.  Cause that came out of nowhere.  I know what that means.  But there were the fucking sneakers.  Yeah.  Big, huge motherfucking sneakers in her trunk.  The only one that could get away with that and not be cheating. 
[01:37:00]  Nicole from the morning mashup.  With her giant freak feet.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Her giant freak feet.  Right.  Wow.  Heartbreak.  What are you going to do?  That one was a bad one.  At least it wasn't.  That was more than a summer romance.  We were like going out, out.  And then it was the dumb thing.  Fucking.  See, E-Rock should have been on the ball with that one.  Should have played Summer Lovin'.  He's too busy in post. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, yeah.  How about present?  Yeah.  How about present production?  Fuck post production.  Concentrate on present production.  Right, right.  Ah, there we go.  But that long distance shit.  That was the one bad thing about leaving home to do what I did.  And I always had to go back home.  Yeah, so you got to leave the girl.  You always had to leave the girl.  Yeah.  Or in my case, I stayed home, which was Geneseo for a while.  That was my fucking base of operation to do all my radio shit. 
[01:38:00]  I remember with this same girl that was going to college, and it was still the summer, but  it was like the last week, and we had spent the entire summer together, and it was at her  house, and it was like the last weekend.  We were hanging out together, and she was inconsolable crying on the couch.  Really?  It was like, I don't want to go to college.  I don't need to.  Fast forward.  Yeah, don't show up.  Yeah, don't just show up.  You really, you should call first. 
[01:38:30]  What happened to tears, you fucking...  Exactly.  You phony crock of shit.  We are multi-millionaires now!  Now look.  Now look.  Where the fuck are you?  Look what you're missing.  Jesus.  I had a broad in Buffalo.  Yeah.  She really, really liked me, and I was really into her as well.  Yeah.  But her mom always got in the way, and was like, you gotta marry. 
[01:39:00]  Sexy.  You gotta find a man with money and a real career.  Oh, boy.  I'll tell you, I was in Buffalo making $14,000 a year.  Righteous bucks.  Scraping.  I mean, scraping.  I would save up all my fucking pocket money to take this broad out to a nicer restaurant,  because that's what her mom expected for her daughter.  Right.  Fast forward.  I'm a multi-millionaire! 
[01:39:30]  Way to not see my potential, you stupid bitch.  There was a lot of...  I also found out she got extremely fat.  Oh, wow.  So fuck you.  There sure was a lot of that missed seeing potential.  Okay.  Of course, I didn't show any potential.  But, boy, no one was willing to really look.  Give me a little time, you know.  Right.  Sometimes you need a little time to figure it all out.  Like 35 years.  Right.  To figure out what you're gonna do with yourself.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, that was...  The mom was obsessed.  Like, you gotta marry a rich man in Buffalo with a nice career.  Well, it's in Buffalo.  It's a relative.  Right.  This radio shit's not gonna work out.  You shouldn't be with him.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  That's where it ends.  She was...  She was like...  That's when I learned about, like, chicks that pop pills and shit.  Yeah.  She was already on the Xanax.  She was...  Oh, nice.  She was in her...  What?  She was a few years younger than me. 
[01:40:30]  So she was...  20, 21 at the time.  I was about 26.  Yeah.  25, 26.  She was already popping Xanax.  Like, they're fucking M&Ms.  Wow.  So, trust me, in the end, I'm...  Thank God I wasn't stupid enough to fall for that shit.  Thank God.  At least, uh...  I'm not pining away for her.  Trust me.  At least they relax on the Xanis.  It's like she's taking that fucking...  What is that?  I always get Adderall and Ativan mixed up.  But they're completely opposite ends of the spectrum. 
[01:41:00]  Are they?  Yeah.  One is like, you're too lazy to snort cocaine, so you take those.  It's like, I really don't want to fucking...  Yeah, Adderall is the...  The fucking pill version of cocaine.  Oh, that's the one that gets you all fucking ramped up.  Yeah, yeah.  And Ativan's the downer.  Wow, why would you make something sound so fucking similar?  My mom's done the Ativan.  She's been on that show.  It's like Sauron and Saruman.  Yeah.  I had to watch Lord of the Rings 18 times before I figured out which was which.  Right. 
[01:41:30]  Anyway.  We're going to talk about Bloomberg's Soda Ban.  Soda Ban.  Being blocked.  We got his press conference and all.  We're going to do that after the break.  It's a good name, by the way.  Soda.  Soda.  Soda.  Also, oh.  Seven.  Yeah.  I got the green light on my next Urban Explorer video.  Now, if this doesn't...  See, people thought I was just bullshitting. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  But my friend Moses Gates, who's got a book coming out called Hidden Cities, he's going  to be in here soon to promote it.  Hidden Cities.  He took me on a tour of some highly illegal places.  Hey, is he the guy that climbed up into the fucking World's Fair Tower?  Maybe.  The observation thing?  They all know each other.  There's some fucking guy.  I saw some fucking photos and a whole story about how he got in, what happened.  I'm doing a radio show! 
[01:42:30]  Oh, my God!  It's Moses Gates on Twitter, right?  I promised him a lot of plugs.  And he took me underground, and we went to the Amtrak tracks where all the mole people  used to live with the murals and stuff.  That video's online, and it did really well.  Yeah, there's my pal Moses Gates.  He's fucking crazy, this guy.  Yeah, that's crazy right there.  It's so photoshopped.  No, it's not.  I saw him do it.  No.  I saw him do that exact thing. 
[01:43:00]  I got a little video of that as well.  That'll be the second video.  But.  But.  Look at that.  That's fucking nuts.  What is he doing?  He's not fucking Spidey.  That's fucking nuts.  That's crazy.  Don't explain what he's doing.  No, not at all.  But that's.  I promised him.  He said tomorrow you can finally release the second video.  That's cool.  So don't even.  Because he has one.  He has.  It's all.  How do I explain this?  It's a whole network of people that do this urban exploring. 
[01:43:30]  And they acquire, excuse me, information about stuff.  Like you were saying, the World Trade Center.  Not the World Trade Center.  The World's Fairgrounds.  The World's Fairgrounds.  The Towers Observations Center.  Like someone gets the info.  Like, look, you could do this.  And if you do this and go blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And they trade this info among each other.  It's an underground fucking group.  It was an amazing story.  The guy fucking.  In order to get into the tower part.  The little round part to get up on the ladders. 
[01:44:00]  Right.  There's a door.  There would have a giant padlock on it.  But there was an opening above.  Right.  Kind of far above.  He made a grappling hook.  Right.  And through the fucking thing, it finally connected.  Right.  And he was able to climb it up like a fucking.  Oh my God.  I would love to do that.  Yeah.  Climbed up.  And then the ladders and stairs in there were all rusted.  And, you know, from bird shit and rain.  Sure.  Getting in there.  There was like parts of the stairs where he had to kind of precariously walk on the arm  rails to the stairs. 
[01:44:30]  Because the actual stairs were gone.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And he's really high up at this point.  But he got in and got up into the observation towers that you see on the side of the expressway  using men in black as the little UFOs that flew up.  And he took pictures from up there.  Wow.  It looked pretty cool.  I wanted to take the drone up there and take some video.  But apparently somebody spotted something kind of close to LaGuardia yesterday.  Another drone, perhaps.  I thought you were finally doing that.  I thought that was you. 
[01:45:00]  No, it wasn't me.  Because there was another, yeah, drone sighting.  And I know it wants to go to the World's Fair and then do video with his helicopter.  But now I'd totally be fucking taken in, at least for questioning, for being so close  to LaGuardia with that thing.  But everyone's ruining my fun.  So anyway, Moses Gates and his gang, they check out shit the average person just doesn't  get to check out.  Well, I won't say what it is.  But that is a picture right there that you won't fucking be able to, like, take of yourself. 
[01:45:30]  That's a picture.  It's like, I am probably one of maybe three people that have done that.  Yeah.  Crazy.  Yeah.  Send me that picture, by the way.  Anyway, I got to add it to my video, please.  Just send it to my phone.  Anyway, Moses Gates, we made an agreement.  When he took me around in December, he goes, look, the only thing I ask is you don't put 
[01:46:00]  any video out unless I, you know, give you the green light, because he doesn't want to  fuck it up for his pals.  Because he wants his pals to have the opportunity that we had.  Yeah.  And he finally emailed me last night.  He goes, dude, you can release the next video on Wednesday.  Wednesday?  Yeah, because today I think there might be some last-minute guys doing something.  Who is the guy?  Steve? 
[01:46:30]  Yes.  Steve.  It's on Undercity.org?  Undercity.org.  Oh, Steve Duncan.  I think Steve Duncan knows Moses Gates.  Is he the blonde that's in the other video that went, that did really well?  There's a link to Urban Explorers TV show.  I think.  Maybe they're all, like, in...  Yeah, I'm telling you, they're all the co-hosts.  That's the guy.  He's talking about a grappling hook and all that stuff.  Yeah, it's pretty fucking cool.  A lot of people that are into this Urban Exploring videos, Steve's the one with the blonde hair.  His video did really, really well.  Where was his video?  Just under the city? 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  Well, he was the one that also climbed, was it the Manhattan or the Brooklyn Bridge?  Like, you know, the fucking...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, the tower.  Yeah, he got all the way up to the top of the tower in the middle of the bridge.  Yeah, that guy?  Yeah, they all know each other, yep.  So that's the guy that grappling hooked his way into the observation tower.  Yeah, so Moses knows him.  Absolutely.  So Moses is going to come in to promote his Hidden Cities book, and he'll certainly have 
[01:47:30]  a lot of great fucking stories, so...  He'll be in in two weeks.  In two weeks, okay.  But the video that me and him did, I'm going to release tomorrow morning.  I think you might get your viral video.  I'm thinking it's a good one.  It's going to do really well, because he showed me something that...  Something in New York that only a handful of people have ever seen.  Just a handful.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And it was really cool. 
[01:48:00]  And I'm thinking...  But it was scary as shit, because I thought at any moment I was going to get arrested.  Well, that's what I'm thinking.  I'm thinking this could be a little precarious to release the video.  Well, because people might ask, like, wait a minute.  Some questions?  How do you do that?  Because I'm sure they don't want other people getting similar ideas with maybe more nefarious ideas.  Well, that's why he didn't want me to release this video, because he knows it's going to get a little attention.  Yeah.  A little bit. 
[01:48:30]  Meh.  Send me that picture.  What's that thing that looks like a funnel behind him?  What do you mean?  That's a light.  Oh, okay.  To light up...  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a big light.  That looks so cool, though.  You're a fucking superhero right there, until you know.  Augusta Wind.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, yeah.  It's Opie Radio on YouTube.  I'll have the video on my front page tomorrow morning.  It's so irresponsible to sit up there.  I'm still editing the video. 
[01:49:00]  Well, that's what gave me anxiety attacks for the first time in my life.  I don't know how you did it.  Every once in a while, I still get freaked out as I'm falling asleep at night.  Just watching someone do that?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'd get...  Yeah, yeah.  Yes, I had major anxiety attacks because of this.  Uh-oh, is that him saying shut the fuck up?  We're not saying enough.  Like if a fly just, like, zooms past your face and you're like, uh...  Dude, the fact that you have to turn around is enough.  Like, like, that's enough. 
[01:49:30]  But that's not even the...  That's gonna be the third video.  Yeah.  Oh.  You wouldn't do it?  No.  I didn't do it.  No.  Fuck no.  You'd be crazy.  Yeah.  Do you think that would be, like...  Dude, it was...  Visible?  Wait a minute.  Like, do you think someone would go...  To the people?  Holy fuck!  No.  No.  No?  No.  Because I know...  You're too high up.  You're way the fuck up.  I know I could...  I could see that.  Maybe someone in another building, but not from the street. 
[01:50:00]  A lot of the guys have done it.  The underground guys.  It's a cool fucking picture.  I gotta be honest with you, but to go out there, I wouldn't even change that fucking light bulb.  And that's not even there.  There.  Fucking snazzy.  Anyway, so...  I finally got the gray light.  I'm very excited.  I got a lot of editing to do today to make sure it looks pretty good.  And I'll release the second video of my urban exploring with Moses Gates. 
[01:50:30]  Pretty fucking cool.  Who said, if I'm up for it, he's got some more things this weekend.  So I might do a couple more things this weekend.  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I blew off the one where he said, there is a possibility you could die.  Oh.  Oh.  No, he said, there's a possibility you could die if you're not paying attention.  And then you go, what?  Huh?  Huh?  And I think being a father made me think, fuck. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah.  See?  See what happens?  I think if I was completely single, I would have just said, oh, yeah.  I went for it.  A little seeker.  Yeah.  But I mean, I would pay attention.  Yeah.  But maybe he's not paying attention and he fucks it up.  Could you zoom in on that?  I think.  No.  To him, actually.  I think what it was, it was a timing issue with trains.  But you had to be paying attention.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Go right to him on that.  Wow.  Like, you have.  Oof.  Yeah.  No, see, you gotta whip your legs around in some way, shape, or form. 
[01:51:30]  That's what it looks.  Get the fuck out of here.  And it looks real slippery.  When I was there, all that looks extremely slippery.  Yeah.  And that's why the anxiety attacks.  And it was a windy day on top of it.  Yeah, look at his hair.  Yeah.  You can see it's kind of blowing.  He's got short hair.  Yeah, that stuff is really slippery.  It's very, you know.  Yeah.  Ooh, look out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:52:00]  Good luck to you.  Keep up your good nature.  So, tomorrow will be the second video.  Of the three.  Tomorrow's a biggie.  It's a thrilling one, so.  Could get it.  Yeah, I showed Anthony the footage a while ago.  I showed Joe Rogan the footage.  He fucking freaked out.  He's like, what the fuck?  Yeah.  Yes.  Crazy.  All right. 
[01:52:30]  Want to talk about Bloomberg next?  Yeah, it's dumb soda ban.  Sody pop ban.  Yeah, absolutely.  All right.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Show, show, show.  So, we got the Cardinals heading to Conclave.  Oh, the Conclave.  The Conclave.  I hate when a story has a word in it. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  That you just keep hearing over and over again.  Or like, conclave.  Yeah, yeah.  Conclave has become a word that I just don't want to fucking hear anymore.  Say it to yourself.  It's fun.  I have.  Conclave.  I have.  I've said it alone many times.  Right.  I think it's all nonsense.  You see the Cardinals showing up like rock stars and they're really nice cars and stuff.  And this paparazzi like, hey, I'm a Cardinal from this fucking country. 
[01:53:30]  I'm watching, I'm listening to the news and they're live from, you know, the Vatican.  And it's just, and here comes this Cardinal and, ooh, all dressed in their red, whatever  they call them, and a gold staff as he walks.  Right.  It's like, what?  This isn't supposed to be like this.  I know.  It's like the red carpet for the Oscars or something.  And then they're giving the odds on, well, this guy.  This guy has a five to one shot to be the Pope.  Yeah. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah, yeah.  They're giving odds.  This guy has a extreme long shot because, as we all know, he was touching kids.  Yeah.  This one didn't touch kids, but he did know about it.  Right.  And we frown on that.  Absolutely.  Conclave, conclave, conclave.  Conclave.  Conclave.  I'm going to shove it in her conclave.  That's what I'm going to do.  I'm going to stick my dick in your fucking conclave.  Well, there's still hope for America.  America.  America. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  There's still hope for America.  Finally.  The land of the free.  Yeah.  I was thinking about this soda band.  And I remember when I started thinking about how ridiculous politicians are in this particular  city when they tried to get rid of cigarettes, the smoking ban.  Yeah.  I'm not a smoker.  I dabbled slightly.  Mm-hmm.  You know, in my 20s like anyone else.  Sure.  But I never really smoked a lot.  And I absolutely hate cigarette smoke.  Don't like it at all.  Although every once in a while when I'm outside and I smell cigarette smoke. 
[01:55:00]  Really?  It's kind of nice.  Never.  I like it.  I fucking hate it.  I like it.  When we walk out this building where I'm getting into my truck, there's usually people out there  smoking.  And you've got to position yourself upwind of where they're all fucking smoking.  I hate it.  Do you hold your breath as you walk by smokers?  And then you realize how amazing smoke is because the other day I was holding my breath  past a guy smoking outside my building and the wind was howling and, you know, the wind 
[01:55:30]  was blowing in my face.  Yeah.  So I passed the cigarette smoking guy.  So then I was like, okay, look, I got the wind.  Right.  Clean.  So I can start breathing again and you still smell the fucking cigarette smoke.  What the fuck is that about?  That's pretty amazing.  Cigarette smoke is amazing.  And I do like smelling every once in a while.  No.  But then you realize it's also the guy's bad breath or the girl's bad breath in there  mixed in with the fucking smoke.  It's fucking.  So it takes me out of the game. 
[01:56:00]  Black lung fucking cells.  But do you remember, I think we were at NEW and they started the smoking shit.  And I remember that pissed me off so much.  Yeah.  And it was something that you taught me years ago how, like, you have to stand up for all  this shit because they never stop.  They don't stop.  They never fucking stop.  And a light bulb went off in my head when you said that to me one day on the air.  And with the cigarette ban, I'm like, look, I hate fucking cigarette smoke.  I fucking hate, you know, you go to a concert or you go to a restaurant and your clothes 
[01:56:30]  smell like cigarettes.  Yeah.  I hate.  We all know.  We all know.  And it's great to go into a restaurant or a sporting event and know you're not going to  smell smoke anymore.  But that's not the point.  I hated that we were telling people what they could do with their establishments.  Right.  It drove me fucking nuts.  I'm like, well, what about the poor bartender?  I'm like, well, then the poor bartender has to get out of that line of work.  He got the job.  I mean, you know, there are people that work in chemical plants, too.  What about the workers?  Well, I don't know what to tell you.  Yeah, they know what they're getting.  We all had shitty fucking jobs that probably affected our health. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm getting skin cancer burned off me every fucking summer.  Jesus.  Because of my caddian days or the pre-pre skin cancer.  The pre.  But anyway, do you remember when they started the smoking ban?  They went after the cigar bars.  Yeah, yeah.  And here's a place where you know walking in, it's called Blah Blah Cigar Bar.  And they banned smoking in cigar bars. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  When the sole purpose of going in those places was to enjoy a really nice cigar, something  I never really got into either.  Yeah.  But our old boss used to go to the one on 56th Street.  I would go there once in a while with Ken Stevens because he enjoyed a good cigar and  I would enjoy a good glass of wine.  We would hang out and talk about it.  It's kind of nice, yeah.  Yeah.  And I kind of like the smell of cigar smoke, too.  Absolutely.  That's totally taking a guy's business down.  Right.  Because it's a cigar bar.  It's not just a bar where it's like, well, the people could still smoke outside, but they're 
[01:58:00]  going to drink.  We got the game on.  We got a dart board.  We got a pool table.  It's not that.  This guy's whole livelihood is the fact that he has an establishment that you can go into,  smoke cigars, and drink some brandy or something like that and wine.  And now you're telling this guy that he can't own his business.  And I was pretty much the only idiot not smoking cigars in the cigar bar.  Yeah.  But my pal and my boss at the time did, so we went there every once in a while just to 
[01:58:30]  kind of talk about the show and the stations we were on and all that shit.  Yeah.  And my point being, I was amazed they were able to tell cigar bars that you're no longer  allowed to have smoking in there.  Yeah.  Because it was like, okay, we're losing the restaurants and the regular bars, but now you're  telling a place that was built for this sole purpose they can't do it.  Yeah.  It seems very unconstitutional to take away someone's business.  And I remember this was a good 10 years ago at this point. 
[01:59:00]  I'm thinking, this is crazy in America.  You can't fucking do this to owners of establishments.  Yeah.  Especially when it's legal substances.  Yeah.  You fast forward and now we're dealing with this dumb soda ban in New York City.  It continues going to your point that they never fucking stop.  This mayor has just been, with the trans fats and the traffic where he makes the big mall  area in Times Square, he just loves making people do stuff that he wants them to do. 
[01:59:30]  And it sounds like, oh, really?  Yeah.  All right.  It's funny.  But, you know, really?  No.  Really?  When you reach a point where you have billions of dollars, billions, where you're, I think,  the fourth or fifth most wealthy person in the world is Bloomberg.  Right.  Uh, you, he, he, he gets a $1 a year as pay for being mayor because he doesn't want, you  know, he doesn't need money.  Once you reach that point, the only thing left is to have power over people, hence him 
[02:00:00]  being mayor.  And then also him being a mayor that just intrudes upon your fucking life at every turn.  Right.  For some bozo reason, whether he believes in these reasons or not.  I honestly think he's, he's psycho enough to actually believe that he's going to make  an impact on obesity by taking coffee from Dunkin' Donuts.  Let me see if you get this right.  Dunkin' Donuts.  Right.  Where you can't get four teaspoons of sugar.  In your coffee.  In your coffee.  Yet you can buy two dozen donuts, sit in the place and shove them down your throat until 
[02:00:30]  you're in a sugar coma.  Right.  Of course.  I think, I think because he's a billionaire, he's completely out of touch.  Out of touch.  With how people, you know, think and live their lives.  And he just wants control.  Because we said it yesterday.  I mean, the sugar ban, it seems like a good concept if you really break it down.  Sure.  But it has to affect everybody to, to try to get into a tiny percentage of people's 
[02:01:00]  brains that this is bad for you and you're killing yourself.  When people fuck up, they, they put it on everybody.  Right.  If, if a small percentage of people can't handle something, it has to be taken away from  everyone.  That's what the government does now.  Yeah.  I, you know, and I don't really drink a lot of soda, to be honest with you.  I don't like, I don't drink a lot of sugary drinks.  It was never my thing, I guess, because we grew up with water, powdered milk and watered  down orange juice.  We didn't really have the, you know, the pleasure of having soda in the house. 
[02:01:30]  So I guess I just got used to not having it.  I'll have a soda.  Like, this is the truth.  I might have 10 sodas a year tops.  Fucking love ice cold Coke.  But when I do, when I do, I love it.  Absolutely.  But I can't imagine, you know, a lifestyle where I'm having a soda every day.  I just can't imagine.  But I'm not going to be the guy that's sitting here saying it's bad for you and you  shouldn't do that.  It's stupid.  If you're getting obese off of soda, you have a bigger issue than what the mayor can  do for you. 
[02:02:00]  He's not going to, someone isn't going to not be obese because the mayor is taking  sodas away from, from everybody.  I think it would be a very, very tiny percent of people that change their lifestyles.  An extremely small number, but we all have to fucking make, make sacrifices to maybe save  this tiny, tiny percent of people.  Yeah.  The end does not justify what they saw called the means.  Of course not.  It's a, it's, it's legislation that affects everybody and is effective to pretty much 
[02:02:30]  nobody.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, um, yesterday it came down in the afternoon and it was a great tweet when I saw it, you  know, that it was over, uh, it was overturned.  You come to judge.  You come to judge.  Yeah.  Judge Holtz Mayer's soda ban calls it arbitrary and capricious.  What?  Can you say that word right?  Arbitrary and capricious.  Is it capricious?  Capricious.  All right.  Fair enough.  Arbitrary and capricious.  The regulations are fraught with arbitrary and capricious consequences, the judge wrote. 
[02:03:00]  Hmm.  Well, you know what?  Um, what does that mean by the way?  Well, I think somebody can explain it a little better.  You sure?  Uh, yeah.  Let's, um, let's go to the clip.  Anything?  Clip?  What clip?  Oh.  This one?  What, are you writing fan fiction?  Writing Bloomberg SodaBand.  Ah, shit.  What clip?  Yeah.  As far as I can tell, your entire enterprise is a little more than a solitary man with a 
[02:03:30]  messy apartment which may or may not contain a chicken.  And with Darren's help, we'll get that chicken.  I'm sorry, but we can't allow Darren to continue working with you.  Well, I have to say, this seems capricious and arbitrary.  Your fly is open.  We go to Seinfeld.  He's using Kramer's fucking, uh, his, uh, argument. 
[02:04:00]  Uh, capricious and arbitrary.  The judge's name is Tingling.  What?  Really?  For real.  Judge Milton Tingling was particularly, uh, miffed with the sliding standard of who would  be covered by the ban and not.  For example, supermarkets and large chain stores don't fall under city regulations.  Who's buying large chains?  Oh.  Yeah.  So you're going to find a way to get your soda.  Yeah. 
[02:04:30]  You could literally walk down the block and get it somewhere.  Right.  Uh-huh.  Uh, and, and wouldn't have been impacted by the ban.  Okay.  But local mom and pop bodegas would have been forced to adhere to the 16 ounce ban.  So you blow off your bodega, you go down to the supermarket, which is close, and get  your large, uh, bottles of soda anyway.  Is that the capricious part or the arbitrary part?  I'm going to go with arbitrary.  All right.  Uh, the simple reading of the rule leads to the earlier acknowledged uneven enforcement  even within a particular city block, much less the city as a whole. 
[02:05:00]  The loopholes in this rule effectively defeat the state purpose of the rule, the judge said,  and then he went, bam!  Gavel?  Gaveled.  He gaveled that shit.  Mm-hmm.  So, and then everyone just mocked Bloomberg all day long on Twitter, which was terrific.  Good.  I was laughing.  Hey, hey, both.  Oh, my God.  Mohamed Elrond?  Yeah.  I guess he's, um, who is that guy?  He's some.  He looks like Papa Pui. 
[02:05:30]  He's some Bonds expert.  He's a Bonds guy.  Yeah.  Oh, that's funny.  Anything else in this article that we, uh, that was, that's the meat of it, really.  Yeah, that's basically it.  Yeah.  So, and, and I feel.  That's a good point.  Travis was saying before the show, you know, a lot of these restaurants prepared for this  whole, uh, ban.  So they're.  Almost everyone.  Yeah.  So they're fucked.  They got rid of all their big, large, uh, glasses and, and cups.  Yeah, because it's not like, it's not like this judge ruled, like, three weeks ahead of  time.  Right.  It was tomorrow. 
[02:06:00]  Last minute.  Yeah.  And you know that like, you know, they're going to be enforcing this tomorrow.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So you had to be prepared for it in advance.  So, uh, again, it's just hurting a small businesses.  Like, I don't feel bad for Dunkin' Donuts who like, you know, lost a couple grand on all  the flyers that they had.  Yeah.  You know, they can afford it.  They, they make giant posters for their new turkey sandwich.  But like these, these, like these little restaurants who threw out all their large glasses  and ordered thousands of small glasses.  They're Travis, I'm in the restaurant business, so a little bit, a little bit, a silent partner, 
[02:06:30]  but I know a little bit about the restaurant business.  That's a, that's a big nut.  Yeah.  Yeah.  For a lot of places we're like, fuck, all right, we got to take the hit and we got to  get rid of, excuse me, all our large glasses and get the small glasses in.  That's a, that's a, that's a, that's a big nut for a lot of places.  Yeah.  And, uh, I guess a, a few places here in the city are, uh, complying just because they have  the shit or what is that?  You always get one asshole, but I mean, bravo to them.  Because, uh, they're getting some attention today. 
[02:07:00]  There's, uh, I forgot the name of the place.  It's like Lucky's something.  Lucky's Cafe or something.  Yeah.  Lucky's Cafe or something.  They said, you know what?  We're going to, we're going to, we're going to ban large sodas anyway.  We think it's the right thing.  The right thing.  But I think they're doing it because they know that the press would pick up on it.  Yeah.  So now everyone's talking about Lucky's Cafe, I think it is, today.  I would just go in, you order a soda, drink it, like, instantly, wait for the waitress  to walk her, excuse me, can I have another soda?  Let's.  Excuse me, can I have another soda?  And you just annoy, annoy the staff. 
[02:07:30]  Well, the one, uh, thing we've learned about Mayor Bloomberg, the city of New York.  Femi?  The mayor of, uh, New York City.  He's a femme.  He's out of touch.  Uh, he likes being protected by people with guns, but doesn't like guns.  That?  Uh, yeah.  What an asshole.  He, uh, he doesn't like taking a no for an answer.  This guy refuses to take no for an answer.  Because he's a billionaire.  Why does he have to take no for an answer?  That's his logic right there.  That's how he feels.  I am the all fucking powerful, uh, almighty. 
[02:08:00]  I don't take no for an answer.  Two terms for mayor?  Go fuck yourself.  I'm doing three.  Right.  And then once I get my third, I'm going to take the rule back to two.  Right.  So that the next mayor can't get three.  I feel like, uh, why do we know more about this than him?  Conclave!  Conclave!  Just makes you get excited.  Oh, God.  I feel like we know way more about this issue than he does.  Yeah.  This one he's way off on.  You're way off!  But he did his dumb press conference, uh, to discuss how, uh, the judge fucked him up. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  Obesity is a leading cause of diabetes, heart disease, and other deadly killers.  Agree.  Let's agree right there.  Obesity is.  Okay.  So how are you going to, how are you going to take care of that, Mayor Bloomberg?  By banning large sodas.  You can feel sorry for yourself.  I hope you don't do that.  I hope you don't.  But if the supermarkets aren't part of this ban, then what are you really accomplishing here?  It's capricious.  And arbitrary.  We've tackled it by promoting exercise and healthy eating, and by supporting green markets 
[02:09:00]  and encouraging bodegas to carry fresh fruits and vegetables.  But the fact is, as we all know, that is not...  And the fresh fruits and vegetables just sit there and rot, by the way.  I am a, I am a New Yorker.  I want to be part of a commercial.  I am a New Yorker.  I am a New Yorker.  And I like donuts.  I like my, uh...  I like a donut.  I like my fruits and vegetables, but I have to have them grinded down into, you know,  some kind of drink for them, myself.  But I see the bodegas.  A lot of that fruit just sits there. 
[02:09:30]  No one's buying an apple.  And people go and grab their egg sandwich on a roll and their bagels and all that shit.  No.  A nice buttered bagel.  That's what they want to eat.  What are you going to do?  Knock it out of their mouths?  You could put all that stuff around.  It doesn't mean people are going to fucking eat it.  The fact is, as we all know, that is not enough.  If we are serious about fighting obesity, we have to be honest about what causes it,  and we have to have the courage to tackle it head on.  70,000 people will die of obesity in America this year. 
[02:10:00]  5,000 people in New York City will die of obesity.  Very good.  Now, the best science tells us...  This will never fucking change.  No.  As soon as we introduced all this sugar to our society, it's over.  It's the famous, you can't shove the toothpaste back in the tube.  Right.  Pandora's out of the box.  Back into the tube.  Close the barn door after the horse has left the toothpaste container.  This is the world we now live in.  It's going to be impossible to take all that away from people. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  They just come up with more ways to form sugar into shit.  The only thing the government should be allowed to do in trying to help the public...  Is educate.  Is educate.  Put up some fucking signs in the subway.  Have fucking some kind of school program.  Whatever.  They cannot take away your ability to make an informed or uninformed purchase.  Right.  It's fucking...  That's...  It's mob tactics. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  I'm all for educating.  Right.  Let people know that.  If you drink a fuckload...  Let a dummy that doesn't know already that if you drink a fuckload of soda every day,  you're going to be a fat pig.  Right.  Comment with some major health issues.  No one has an issue with the calorie counts on the menu.  Right.  That's all...  I personally love that because I had no idea.  And I've always tried to eat relatively well.  And when I started seeing some of the stuff I used to eat, I'm like, really?  I used to eat a dumb scone at Starbucks.  I thought that was like 200 calories. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  That's like 680.  I'm like, what?  Really?  Whatever.  But telling...  That's what I get fucking pissed about with the government.  And I get pissed also when people tell me, you're so paranoid.  The government isn't.  And then they insert whatever it is here.  It's like, yeah, not this time.  Right.  But it creeps up and they chisel away at your liberties.  And before you know it, you're not allowed to do something.  Right.  There.  It happens all the time.  And life is really, really hard for a lot of fucking people. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  Maybe their dumb enjoyment during the day is to have a fucking large soda.  A big ass fucking soda.  Or a donut.  Or a fucking buttered roll.  I can bring it back to my dad.  When my dad had horrendous heart issues, they just said, look, you gotta fucking start eating  much fucking better.  Literally salads, no meat, no fried food.  And he tried.  He was already, what, in his late 60s when it all was starting to go bad and into his early 70s?  We saw it on his face. 
[02:12:30]  He fucking hated living that way.  He was suffering.  It's like, just what he did.  And then we were like, who are we, man?  He lived his fucking life.  He wants to go out and have some goddamn chicken wings with some vets.  There you go.  And a bunch of beers.  It's like, you know what?  And we finally let go.  Instead of hassling him about it, we're like, you know what?  This is what is bringing him enjoyment in his life.  Exactly.  And that's how it is, no matter how old you are with some of these people.  A lot of these people.  This is what keeps them going and gives them a little joy.  Yeah. 
[02:13:00]  A dumb ice cream cone on the way fucking home.  You're going to ban that next?  I just don't see, like, if you look at this with the sodas, especially with the Dunkin' Donuts example, the fact that you can just buy donuts and shove them in your face.  The next step, especially listening to him speak, the next step is limiting how many donuts you could buy.  Of course.  And now it's ridiculous.  Like, oh, they wouldn't do that.  Of course.  If you can't walk into Dunkin' Donuts and get sugar in your coffee because they're worried that it's going to make you obese, you don't think they realize the hypocrisy and the fact that you could get donuts and do that? 
[02:13:30]  So why wouldn't they down the line go, hey, you know what?  You can only buy two donuts.  The sugar intake.  Yeah.  You have to only buy a certain amount of sugar.  Right.  Or a sugar product in one shot.  So it would be down the line they would start doing shit like this.  You've got to stop them.  Thank God for this, Judge.  You've got to stop them right here.  Now, the best science tells us that sugary drinks are a leading cause of obesity. 
[02:14:00]  Some people say, just talk about the problem.  Raise awareness and hope that results in...  Oh, he was listening to us.  Hey, look at that.  Oh, well, Mr.  I do want to stop again just to point out to everybody.  You hear it in his voice.  He hates being told no.  Oh, yeah.  He is fucking mad.  Oh, yeah.  Just going to go backwards a little bit here.  Talk about the problem.  Raise awareness and hope that results in change.  But it's not enough to talk and it's not enough to hope. 
[02:14:30]  We have a responsibility as human beings to do something to save each other,  to save the lives of ourselves, our families, our friends.  Yeah, okay.  Could you pause?  You're right.  You do.  So, if you have a family member or a friend that is obese or on the way to obesity  because of drinking too much soda or eating too many fucking donuts,  how about you go up to that person as a friend or family member  and address the problem that way?  The last person or entity that should be involved is the fucking government on any level. 
[02:15:00]  Federal, state, local.  No federal entity should be dealing with this.  But he's right.  You should as a friend and family member.  Not as the government.  Do something to save each other, to save the lives of ourselves, our families, our friends,  and all of the rest of the people that live on God's planet.  It's God's planet?  I don't like this guy at all, man.  Don't like him.  Don't believe in him. 
[02:15:30]  He exists.  Now, there's going to be people that say, we all pay.  We all pay because these people are unhealthy.  Right.  All right.  Then deal with that as a separate issue.  Deal with why we all pay.  We pay through what?  Insurance and medical bills and things like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We pay.  But you're not going to stop this by taking away people's little sodas.  Big sodas.  Yeah. 
[02:16:00]  Well, you're going to not be happy.  Oh, no.  And so while other people will wring their hands over the problem of shivery drinks in  New York City, we're doing something about it.  The Board of Health.  But you're not.  No, you're not doing anything about it.  You think you are because you're a fucking billionaire, out of touch, evil fucking guy.  Dare I say it's a facade.  Yeah.  It really is a facade.  There's nothing behind this.  He's Dr. Evil.  He's like Dr. Evil, but only like as an effeminate man, as a femi Dr. Evil. 
[02:16:30]  Hmm.  What can I do today?  That's what he does.  He's rich.  He has his like lair.  And he just tries to fucking get his influence all over the place.  Right.  Do you think he's in a grumpy mood because today was his big day?  Oh, man.  Do you know what?  His staff is probably fucking.  They're probably like, don't even go in there today.  Don't even go.  It's like fucking.  It's like the Hitler thing.  They should make one more Hitler video from the bunker where he's talking about how his 
[02:17:00]  soda ban didn't go through.  So if someone comes back from lunch at City Hall and accidentally still has their soda.  Oh, God.  Steiner.  Oh, my God.  What are you doing?  In New York City, we're doing something about it.  The Board of Health's limit on the serving size of sugary drinks does not limit anyone's  consumption.  It just requires them to think about whether they really want more than 16 ounces.  Remember, for many years, the standard soda size was six ounces, not 16. 
[02:17:30]  It was six.  Then it became 12, and people thought that was huge.  The Dow was once at 300.  Then it became 16, then 20 ounces.  We believe it's reasonable to draw a line, and it's reasonable to draw a line right now.  With so many people contracting diabetes and heart disease, with so many children who are  overweight and obese, with so many poor neighborhoods suffering the worst of this epidemic, we believe  it is reasonable and responsible to draw a line.  And that is what the Board of Health has done. 
[02:18:00]  As a matter of fact, it would be irresponsible not to try to do everything we can to save  lives.  It's not going to save lives.  No.  And how do they benefit?  What do you mean?  The city, I don't believe they actually look out for the individual ever.  It's always another way to make money.  So where's the money part of this?  Where's the money part of this?  Doling out fines to people?  $200 a clip for people that are selling them? 
[02:18:30]  They always come up with these new laws knowing that it's a nice little money stream.  Again, it's just a power thing.  It's a way of knocking the people down under his fucking iron fist.  Under his fucking pink fist.  That he just, he loves injecting himself into everyone's lives.  Because that's all he could do.  He's already conquered the world financially.  He's a public official in the government. 
[02:19:00]  And all he can really do, the only reason to wake up in the morning, is to see how he  can influence the people under his reign of soda terror.  Throughout its history, the New York City Board of Health has taken bold action to confront  many public health problems.  It banned lead paint.  It required fluoride to be included in drinking water.  And it required calorie counts to be included on the menus of chained restaurants.  All stuff I agree with. 
[02:19:30]  I think lead paint is a little different, too.  No kidding.  It's not like you're going like, yeah, I want some lead paint here.  It was, people didn't know that there was lead paint.  And it was fucking their kids up.  Remember when we had lead paint?  Yeah, remember lead paint?  I miss lead paint.  And you couldn't really avoid lead paint.  I saw lead paint back in fucking 75.  It ruled.  They opened up for Deep Purple, didn't they?  Yes, lead paint.  ...some chained restaurants.  In each of these cases, the federal government later followed the Board of Health's example. 
[02:20:00]  Our Board of Health has always been a pioneer, and we're very proud of it.  It has always been ahead of the curve.  And you would expect nothing less from this city.  Banning trans fats and adopting restaurant grading are just two other recent examples of that.  Limiting the size of sugary beverage.  Education.  I love the restaurant ratings, by the way.  There's A's, B's, C's in the windows of restaurants as you go around New York.  And you could look and go, all right, whether the inspection works or is good or not, it's just telling me that this restaurant has an A as far as its health inspection went. 
[02:20:30]  That's fine.  And how do you feel about him banning trans fats?  I didn't agree with that either.  I don't think any kind of ban or stepping in.  I think, again, you should have to educate people and let them know that there are trans fats in certain things.  Maybe have to reprint your menus, things like that.  But to ban things?  And, you know, damn well some of these restaurants are still using trans fats. 
[02:21:00]  Who are you kidding?  I'm a fat daddy.  Two other recent examples of that.  Limiting the size of sugary beverages is consistent with the Board of Health's tradition and its mission.  And we believe that ultimately the courts will find it consistent with the law.  Being the first to do something is never easy.  When we began this process, we knew we would face lawsuits.  Anytime you adopt a groundbreaking policy, special interests will sue. 
[02:21:30]  That's America.  Special interests.  But we strongly believe that in the end, the courts will recognize the Board of Health's authority to regulate the sale of beverages that have virtually no nutritional value  and which, consumed in large quantities, are leading to disease and death for thousands of people every year.  There are many, many instances where a lower court decision has gone against us and then been reversed.  If lower court rulings had always stood, Grand Central Terminal would have been knocked down 40 years ago. 
[02:22:00]  And we're confident that today's decision will ultimately be reversed, too.  That's not the same example.  He's talking apples and oranges.  It's a whole different thing.  He's an idiot.  And then Bloomberg went on Letterman.  I hope Letterman gave him a talking to.  Letterman didn't give him a talking to.  Oh, why would he?  They're buddies.  He agreed with him.  Letterman did agree with him.  Oh, boy.  I don't see... 
[02:22:30]  Oh, whatever.  Let's make it the same point over and over again.  I know.  We heard today that the sugary 16-ounce soda ban...  We heard today...  Like he's just getting into the conversation.  We heard today...  We heard today that the sugary 16-ounce soda ban has been overruled by the state court.  Is that what happened?  The state court judge said the Department of Health didn't have the authority to do it.  We think that they do. 
[02:23:00]  We'll appeal.  In the meantime, this year, 70,000 Americans will die from obesity.  5,000 here in New York.  We've got to do something about it.  70,000 Americans.  He's trying to save 5,000 people a year.  That'll work.  Out of those 5,000, how many would he actually save?  Because it really is, in the end...  We've talked about this, too.  You can't save everybody.  No, it's a numbers game.  Especially when you have to affect so many people to try to save everybody.  Out of the 5,000 people that are going to die every year from obesity, how many of them 
[02:23:30]  will change their lives because of the soda ban?  Honestly, how many do you really think?  Not many.  Not even 1% of the 5,000?  No, no way.  Not even 1%.  It's a fraction of 1%, I guarantee you.  So everyone has to fucking be completely bothered to maybe, if it's 1%, save 500 people?  Yeah.  Sorry.  That's just, you know, how the world works.  Mind if I wash this down with your unsweetened beverage?  1,000 people will die from obesity. 
[02:24:00]  And what would be the statistics of people who are dying of starvation versus people who  are dying from obesity?  For the first time in the history of the world, more people will die from overeating than under  eating this year.  Isn't that remarkable?  It's all happened in the last 20 years.  And now, I've had this argument with various people over the years, and I believe that  it's the corporate food industry, not the individual, that is at fault. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah, but you're never going to take those guys down.  How come?  That's the point here.  Why?  Unfortunately, you're just not going to be able to do that.  Am I fucking retarded?  Why?  Well, yes.  Why?  Don't make us answer that.  I know.  Why on earth is everyone being given a pass for self-responsibility?  I mean, Dave's blaming the corporate food people.  The mayor's got to step in and save people's lives.  How about individual responsibility? 
[02:25:00]  Making a big old comeback.  Huh?  Holy mother of fuckwad.  Everyone needs a goddamn babysitter now.  It's not like we're all running out in the hallway, getting in the elevator, pressing  five buttons to find daddy.  I'm still sad about that.  It's fucking heartbreaking.  Especially when I saw the kid this weekend.  Like, oh, I just picked him going, mommy, help me.  I was saying, mommy, daddy, help me.  Like, oh, let the kid have a donut.  Oh, he's still talking about it, too. 
[02:25:30]  Never, ever go in the elevator.  Oh, boy.  He's reciting back to us now.  Never, ever go in the elevator?  That's a good thing to say.  They should make a kid's show song about, oh, never, ever go in the elevator.  Very scary place.  Could get stuck with a masturbator.  Something, you know, just to let the kids know what could happen.  It's terrible.  You get Henry Winkler.  Yes.  For a PSA.  Back to Letterman.  The industry, not the individual that is at fault here. 
[02:26:00]  I think that it is incumbent on government to tell people what they're doing to themselves  and let people make their own decisions.  So our job is to educate people.  And the ban on bigger cup sizes was a ways to remind you if you wanted three, two, one.  Bullshit.  We're going to remind you.  Let us remind you how bad it is by taking it away from you. 
[02:26:30]  I'm not taking this away.  We're reminding you that you can't get it.  What percentage?  It's brilliant.  What percentage, we'll just stick with New York, of New Yorkers aren't aware that drinking  a lot of soda is bad for you?  You've got to know it.  Stop it.  You've got to know it.  That number has to be so ridiculously low.  I mean, even if you want to legislate something where something, a warning has to be put on  the can, like cigarettes have it or something and booze. 
[02:27:00]  We talk about it on this show, man.  We're far from perfect.  I want to eat bacon every fucking day.  It's delicious.  I want bacon every day.  Who doesn't?  I want Entenmann's every day.  I love a chocolate Entenmann's donut.  I would eat the crumb cake every fucking day.  What kind of crumb cake, though?  You've got to go original.  Oh, really?  The classic, yes.  What brand puts that out?  Entenmann's. 
[02:27:30]  Entenmann's.  Entenmann's.  Entenmann's.  Yes.  It's wonderful.  I don't know where.  You think I want to eat oatmeal with not even sugar on it and not made with milk every  morning?  That's pretty much my go-to fucking brand.  Of course I don't want to eat that.  He is too fucking much.  But what happens with other people where they just go, ah, fuck it?  But my point is they go, fuck it, but then they think, but now the mayor's going to get  involved and they're going to not say fuck it anymore. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  I don't believe that.  It's all about fucking personal accountability and responsibility and taking the blame for  certain things.  When there's a fucking fatty walking around, unless you carry around your medical records  and can throw a thyroid problem at me and tell me that that's why you're fat, you fucking  know why you're fat.  And to take that into account and say, well, maybe it's because I drink a fuckload of sodas  every day.  Oh, well, that person could drink sodas and they don't get fat, but I do do it. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah.  Well, sorry.  There's your cross to bear in life.  Right.  We all have them.  Like if he really cared about like health and stuff, don't you think he would eliminate  cigarettes?  Oh.  The biggest killer in the world.  But there's a tax on that.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  Really?  Oh.  So that's why it wouldn't be eliminated.  Tobacco in this country.  They lose money.  Yeah.  They lose money.  And wow, would you have a fucking mutiny on your hands.  This guy agrees with, you want to hear from a guy that agrees? 
[02:29:00]  With the mayor?  Yeah, we do like trying to make sure both sides represent a lot of shit.  I'd say we're fair and balanced.  We certainly are.  Let's put that on the fucking wall.  Russ in Atlanta.  Russ.  Anthony, I'm going to try to make this cover all of the topics, but I can't stand Bloomberg.  I feel like he's a meddler, but down here in Atlanta, I hate the stereotype, but every  third person is this huge fat cow.  I don't think that we should take it away, but I think we should standardize smaller portions 
[02:29:30]  and make them pay for bigger portions because ultimately it goes through to people like you  and me who can still see our feet.  We have to pay increased insurance because these fat, I mean, the people that eat at  fat food places consistently are fat, usually, you know, hourly wage people that can't.  All right, hold on, hold on.  I want to stop you because you said something there that's very interesting, which I think  I would agree with.  You said, you know, make the standardized portion smaller, and then if you do want more, then 
[02:30:00]  obviously you've got to pay more, and that way maybe it makes people take care of themselves  a little better.  Where's that?  Because now there's a financial thing.  But you are paying more for larger than you are for smaller.  It's always been that way.  But if you're paying more, more, then where does that money go?  Who's taking it?  Is the state now taking it to fucking tax?  Fatty tax?  Let the corporations have more money.  Who gives a fuck?  But at least that's something where I can see where people go, oh, man, now my fucking 
[02:30:30]  soda habit is really costing me.  I better cut that out a little bit.  What I'm saying is...  That would be more effective, I think, than this nonsense that our mayor is doing.  But I think we should pass the cost.  Like, why should I pay more for insurance when I'm a healthy portion?  And it's what you said earlier.  You want bacon.  I love bacon, but pigs are delicious.  But I say no to them on occasion because I've got the willpower to turn stuff down.  I haven't had soda in years just because I know it's not good for you. 
[02:31:00]  But I feel like they should pay for the increased portion.  I shouldn't have to pay for increased insurance charges because of their decision-making or  lack of...  Well, Obamacare is going to take care of all that.  Yeah, don't worry.  Everyone's going to have free health care.  It's going to be great.  All right.  Good point, man.  Thank you, Russ.  He does make a good point, but I, again...  Well, it would be more effective than this thing.  It would be more effective, but again, I don't like the idea of the government stepping  in, and now they would step in and make it a financial windfall for them, much like 
[02:31:30]  they have cigarettes.  You know, they tax the living fuck out of cigarettes in New York City.  It's up to...  How much is a pack of cigarettes in the city?  Anyone know?  No one even smokes here anymore.  Last I saw it was $10, but I think it's over that now.  I think it's over that now.  It's way over $10.  Someone's saying $12 here.  Okay, $12.  And honestly, the price of cigarettes hasn't gone up.  They slap so much tax on the cigarettes to try to keep people from smoking.  The price of cigarettes doesn't stop someone from smoking. 
[02:32:00]  Never has.  I think people are a little more health conscious and a little more knowledgeable about the dangers  of smoking, and I think that's why people have stopped smoking.  More than the cost.  I mean, even when I was a working slob, I didn't give a fuck how much cigarettes cost.  You'd gripe.  You're like, oh, fuck, another dollar a pack?  But you kept smoking because, you know, you like smoking.  Or you'd bum one off somebody else.  Can I bum a cigarette from you?  Hey, man, can I bum a cigarette? 
[02:32:30]  I only have...  I stole a pack from my mom.  What does she smoke?  Chesterfields.  No filter.  I've noticed how that has changed over the years, just observing people.  Yeah.  Man, they're not happy like they used to be when you asked to bum a cigarette.  No one bums cigarettes.  Every cigarette is so valuable to the smoker now because it's so expensive.  They get really bummed out because it is the culture to give one up.  Yeah.  But they don't do it with a smile on their face anymore.  Instead of...  Because a lot of people are talking about that. 
[02:33:00]  Hey, you're a healthy guy.  You get your insurance, and your insurance bill is saddled with these people that are also fat pigs.  Right.  Um, how about instead of charging everybody more because they're fatties, you give healthy  people, uh, less.  You charge them less for insurance, and you charge the people that aren't healthy more  for insurance.  That's how it should work.  But then you get people bitching.  Well, you're fat.  Well, why don't we get Flo on that?  Yeah.  Flo? 
[02:33:30]  Let's move her into the medical field.  Flo jumped the shark, by the way.  They took her out of the white room.  Doesn't work.  She's on a boat.  She's in a fucking dark alley.  You don't like her trotting around?  No, man.  Working with people?  I like Flo when she was in that weird white room that no one would ever shop in.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know they do that with life insurance, but they don't do it with health insurance?  Health insurance?  Not really.  Not so much.  Maybe a little bit more in there, but...  It's a reminder that you can't get it.  I love his reminder.  His educating people is not letting them get something. 
[02:34:00]  That's very different than educating.  Yeah, yeah.  It's two different things, Mr. Bloomberg.  That's like someone punching you in the face to give you an education.  Wow.  Hey, I'm educating you.  Well, you sort of are educated.  Well, you are, but you know what?  I don't like being punched in the face.  You could have told me I was going to punch you in the face if you do that.  Right.  Or you could punch me in the face.  Right.  The job is to educate people, and the ban on bigger cup sizes was a way to remind you  if you wanted 32 ounces, you'd have to take two cups, so maybe you'd only take one. 
[02:34:30]  But people have a right to make products, and people have a right to buy them,  and I don't know which comes first.  The argument could also be made that in a country of this size and around most of the world,  it takes this kind of operation to feed all of these people.  But it is so engineered.  The taste, the sweetness, the saltiness, the amount of pressure one needs to crack a potato chip with their teeth  has all been engineered so people continue to eat that kind of food. 
[02:35:00]  As long as you don't ban Cheez-Its.  Cheez-Its are okay.  That's my addiction.  You shove them up your ass?  Cheez-Its.  Who likes Cheez-Its?  Of course he likes Cheez-Its.  That's all you need to know about our mayor.  Can someone get me a bag of Cheez-Its?  I'll eat Cheez-Its, but I'm not going out of my way to find them.  So far down the fucking snack totem pole there.  Doritos, pretty high up there for me.  And the potato chips, what?  You want a grisly, fucking tough-to-bite-through potato chip? 
[02:35:30]  Of course not.  Oh, look at Cheez-Its!  This is what this idiot likes.  Square like our mayor.  Oh, my God.  I'll eat Cheez-Its, yes.  I will not fucking enjoy a Cheez-It.  I'll eat them, but if I'm in the supermarket, I'm like, oh, boy, I just ran out of Cheez-Its.  Where's the Cheez-Its aisle?  You never go into a supermarket, too, and notice, oh, they're all out of Cheez-Its.  No.  Damn.  Of course he likes Cheez-Its. 
[02:36:00]  I guess I'm going to have to get bugles.  Let's go to the expert.  E-Rock Cheez-Its.  E-Rock Cheez-Its comment.  No, Cheez-Its suck.  You have to get Cheez-Its.  Cheez-Its.  What's the difference between Cheez-Its and Cheez-Its?  Cheez-Its taste like you're eating a coaster.  It's like they're stale and just have no taste to it.  Cheez-Its are made by Nabisco, I think.  Oh, Cheez-Its are Cheez-Its.  Sam, you know a little bit about they look exactly like Cheez-Its.  Taste test.  Big difference.  Sam, do you like the Cheez-Its? 
[02:36:30]  I prefer Cheez-Its.  Whoa.  Like the mayor.  But that's just, to me, I think that's just brand loyalty.  Well, Mayor Roberts.  Do you search out Cheez-Its?  Hell no.  Of course.  No one does.  You know what I prefer to Cheez-Its?  And this says something about how bad Cheez-Its are.  Don't say bugles.  I would prefer a Triscuit to a Cheez-Its.  I cannot even look at Triscuits.  And those that's just wheat and salt.  Terrible.  I would prefer a Triscuit to a Cheez-Its.  Pepper Cheez-Its?  No.  Triscuits?  I will not even look at a Triscuit.  Did you do the pepper ones? 
[02:37:00]  I was starving.  Those were amazing.  It's terrible.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's horrible.  I'll never eat a Triscuit again.  What about a nice slice of sharp cheddar in between two Triscuits?  No, not Triscuits.  I like them on any kind of regular cracker.  Ritz is good.  Let me tell you something.  Ritz is good.  Nice and buttery.  Cheddar fucking cheese is the greatest thing ever.  Extra sharp?  Extra sharp?  Yes.  White or yellow?  Yellow.  Uh, I don't care.  Although I call it orange because it's orange. 
[02:37:30]  I like the orange, yellow.  But, man, when you're just sitting there with that block of fucking cheddar, slicing that  off, slapping it on a cracker and shoving it down your craw.  You ever get the pre-sliced cracker?  Here comes the pre.  Cracker barrel pre-sliced cheddar?  Cracker barrel!  Dude, it's in the plastic, a Ziploc top, and they're...  Wax paper.  Individually sliced.  ...individually sliced.  Oh, I just can shove that right in my face.  Right.  Watch out.  I'm not even going to put it on a cracker.  No.  No.  I don't do that. 
[02:38:00]  What do you got?  A nice Swiss cheese?  I like a good Swiss, too.  Not sandwich Swiss.  Y'all'sburg.  No, no.  I like a good Swiss.  Cut up nice.  Y'all'sburg.  Y'all'sburg.  Y'all'sburg.  Y'all'sburg.  Y'all'sburg.  What's your sandwich cheese?  If you're going to have a sandwich.  I think I mostly go Swiss.  It matters what kind of meat I got.  If I'm doing ham, I'm doing Swiss.  But if it's beef, I'm doing American.  Burger, I go cheddar.  Chicken cutlet.  No, cheddar's too greasy.  Chicken cutlet, you gotta go moose.  I don't like melted cheddar.  Can't melt.  It doesn't melt right. 
[02:38:30]  You know what you do with the chicken cutlet?  Provolone.  Provolone is that cheese.  Try it.  A little parmesan.  That's in between a lot of different cheeses.  Provolone?  A little hot sauce?  Provolone has an identity problem.  Yeah, I mean, it's very close to mozzarella.  It wishes it was mozzarella.  I think so.  I think it's lazy.  I've had it on sandwiches.  Provolone?  Provolone.  Provolone is with salami.  If you have salami, you have provolone.  Well, now that you're talking salami, we gotta talk olive loaf. 
[02:39:00]  He rock!  Boar's head.  He loves salt.  That's what's on your shoulders.  Olive loaf?  Why?  Out of all the fucking cured meats you could eat.  Oh, God.  Why olive loaf?  Is that your number one?  No, no, no.  Oh, okay.  Man, I haven't eaten in so long, though, but it was delicious.  You haven't eaten in so long?  It doesn't agree with me anymore.  Did he say that?  Does it give you tummy upset? 
[02:39:30]  Yeah.  It's great.  It's like bologna with sliced green olive.  It looks like head cheese.  No, it doesn't.  All right, we got an obese guy that wants to comment on the soda ban.  We got Mike and PA.  The phone's, by the way, lit for this segment.  Certainly.  Mike, go ahead.  Mike!  Hey, good morning, boys.  How are you?  Hey, Mikey.  Hey, I'm a fat, so...  Okay.  Jolly man laughs.  The whole soda ban thing is just ridiculous, because you know what?  If I buy a small soda, I'm refilling. 
[02:40:00]  Of course you are.  Well, that's what they say.  The mayor's just reminding you that if you have to refill it, you're going to be thinking,  like, do I really need to refill this?  No, you're not.  Well, I'm thinking it took me ten steps to get to that fountain.  I'm going to refill it.  That's how I look at it.  No, but my problem with the whole ban is, and the 5,000 people that are going to die  of obesity, whatever, let them die.  I eat because I'm unhappy, and I'm unhappy because I eat. 
[02:40:30]  Right.  What's more cost-effective, putting somebody in a nursing home for 10 years when they're  80 years old and debilitated, or killing them off when they're 60?  Uh-huh.  And someone makes the point, as we're on the phone with Mike, Chris in Stad Island, I don't  know if I have time to go to him, he says, I used to be 500 pounds, drinking soda,  and this is our point today, is just a small part of a fat person's diet.  Exactly.  Right, right.  They think, this stupid mayor thinks that he bans the large sodas, next thing that, you 
[02:41:00]  know, all the fat people are going to lose a shitload of weight.  Supermodels walking around in Manhattan.  It's going to be great.  It's a small part of your diet.  Self-control is such an issue, because I have none.  I understand the issue with it, and I'll tell you what, an addiction to sugar is a fuck  of a thing worse than addiction to cocaine, because I've done the cocaine, and it's not  so bad.  The sugar is a motherfucker.  Yeah, sugar's rough, man.  Hey, good day, guys.  I appreciate it.  The other night...  All right, thank you, chubby bastard.  The other night, we made peanut butter cookies from scratch. 
[02:41:30]  Huge.  Big fan of peanut butter cookies.  Yeah, I'm not.  Came out of the oven warm, and I went to fucking town.  I had like six of them, and they were big, too.  I just went nuts.  Yeah.  I woke up with a pounding sugar headache that I said.  Did you?  Yeah.  Yeah, because I don't eat that much sugar anymore.  Get that sugar rush.  Boy, did I.  Boy, did I.  And has my house set up like a fucking obstacle course.  Like, I have to have such self-control.  The fridge now, the freezer, those fucking ice cream sandwiches are in there. 
[02:42:00]  And then there's a big thing of oatmeal raisin cookies on the shelf with chocolate-covered  raisins next to that.  And then in the pantry, as far as you can see, Doritos, wise potato chips, fucking all  kinds of pretzels and things.  And then in the fridge, there's tombstone pizzas.  And fucking...  Dude!  And I'm trying not to... 
[02:42:30]  And then I go into the pantry, and I grab a progresso fucking low-sodium soup, and I  eat that, and that's my dinner.  And I look around my house going, ah!  So you're different than me.  If all that stuff was in my house, I would eat all of it.  So my thing over the years is I try to keep it all out of the house, but now that I have  kids, it's creeping in, because you can't help yourself.  You've got to let your kids enjoy themselves a little bit.  And I do educate them.  My young son, he loves a good vegetable juice, believe it or not, because I got him started 
[02:43:00]  on that really early.  Yeah.  So he actually looks forward to it still, even though he's now dipping into junk food.  But my in-laws and my family comes up from Philly, or my family from Long Island, and  they hate coming over our house, because we have no good shit to eat.  No good stuff.  That's it.  And we forget sometimes, because we realize, so, you know, before they arrive, we make sure  we go down and try to have some stuff around that they can snack on.  Yeah, yeah.  We try to do the right thing, but those weekends where we forget, they come over like, what 
[02:43:30]  the fuck, you guys got nothing good to eat here, what the fuck?  Nothing good, yeah.  So, I'm going to pee my pants.  Oh, yeah.  Believe it or not, after the break, I want an update on my favorite wrestler.  Whoa.  Stop the presses.  Yeah.  Your favorite wrestler.  Fandango.  You've got to say it right.  You've got to make sure you let the A's breathe.  Fandango.  Fandango. 
[02:44:00]  I haven't been into wrestling for many years at this point.  And Fandango is getting you back.  I take a peek every once in a while, but this Fandango storyline, it's got me a little bit.  You like it.  I didn't watch yesterday, because I was in a stupid meditation class, but I want a Fandango  update.  Yes, I got you.  And I also, I'm hearing rumors that Vince is just showing his true colors again.  I keep getting tweets that I've got to share this with you.  Yeah, see that, and I want the people to know, because I told Sam, don't fucking ever bring 
[02:44:30]  that wrestling fanboy shit to our show.  When it's stuff that, like, a mainstream audience could maybe get into a little bit, fine.  Like, maybe the Fandango, or Mr. Ass, or...  Mr. Ass, again, on Raw last night, by the way.  All right.  Or Vince McMahon showing his true colors.  That's the shit I would absolutely want to, you know, explore on the show.  Is that what happened?  He was supposed to wrestle last night, but somebody wasn't saying his name right.  That's the whole bit.  That's why I love it.  He did it again. 
[02:45:00]  He did it again?  It's hilarious.  And you have the audio?  Uh-huh.  That is a funny angle, man.  I gotta say.  I...  What a dumb angle.  I follow Sam on Twitter when, I think it was last week, you tweeted that they're bringing  all the old school guys back.  That's when I'm like, fuck, I gotta watch that, because that's when I really liked wrestling.  I'm pissed if Billy Gunn comes out, and they don't play Ass Man no more.  Right.  And then, uh...  What a waste of a great song.  Wait.  He was on, uh...  He was on again last night, and still no...  But he was on the week before when you watched it, too. 
[02:45:30]  Who?  Mr. Ass.  But why don't they play his song?  Because he comes out with the Road Dog, and they play the New Age Outlaws theme.  But it's all...  They don't call him Mr. Ass.  They don't use to say Ass.  Oh, they're probably not even allowed to.  Oh, what a waste.  For the PC shit.  But anyway...  He loves to pick him, he loves to stick him, he loves to touch him, he just loves the Ass.  Because Sam's tweet about bringing the old guys back, I'm like, fuck, I gotta watch.  So I tuned in, I'm not even joking, for the first time in years.  And it was right when this dumb fandango fucking thing came out. 
[02:46:00]  I don't know how you say it.  And I'm like, holy shit, I'm in.  This is hilariously stupid.  At first you were like, this is so stupid, why would I watch this?  And then when you let it sit with you...  Yeah, and let it breathe.  That's such a great dumb bit.  So we got audio from last night?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Alright, cool.  Take a break.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  I'm a nice man.  Yeah, I'm a nice man.  Yeah! 
[02:46:30]  You're missing your song, Anthony.  We're doing this one for you.  Ding, ding, ding, ding.  I'm a horse, man!  Oh, yeah.  I love to kick em.  Kick em.  I love to shove em.  Shuffle em.  I love to stick em.  Stick em.  Love to blow em.  I love to watch em.  Yeah, just whop, whop, whop, whop, whop, whop, whop.  Yeah.  And I'm gonna kick em.  Kick em.  Cause I'm an ass man.  Yeah!  Okay!  Yeah!  And I'm an ass man.  Oh, nice.  Yes, I'm an ass man. 
[02:47:00]  Billy Gunn.  He was out there last night, but...  I'm an ass man.  Yeah!  But then I'll call him the ass man.  What a waste of a great gimmick, a great name.  Ass man.  Hey, before we move on to this wrestling thing, I was thinking about the soda band some more  as I went to the bathroom.  And I'm thinking the only way you're gonna solve this obesity problem is to make, somehow  figure out how to make things taste good that are healthy for you.  It's...  That's the only thing.  And I know it's very complicated and they're not having much success with that. 
[02:47:30]  Because then I was thinking about some of the stuff I do like and that I crave.  And I'm a big Pop-Tarts guy still to this day.  And when the company did the right thing, which a lot of companies try to do, they try  to get an alternative that's not as bad for you and they throw it on the shelves, right?  Yeah.  So I'm like, oh, Pop-Tarts, but I'm trying to eat less Pop-Tarts and try to eat a little  healthy.  Oh, they got the low-fat Pop-Tarts.  I tried them.  They fucking suck a dick.  Really?  So I went back to the regular Pop-Tarts. 
[02:48:00]  What happened?  I don't know.  Eric won't stop playing his fans.  And that's making you cry today?  Out of everything we've done today?  We're talking about soda.  And Eric refuses to turn it on.  I would too.  Because Eric gets very excited when we talk wrestling.  He's all in right now.  He's been faded out, but he just brought it down.  You know why?  He doesn't want us to forget that we have to talk about wrestling.  But Sam's a weirdo.  This is what makes him laugh.  Ass man.  Yeah. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah.  I'm an ass man.  Yeah.  But you're crying.  Your laugh is so hard.  It's bizarre.  I like bizarre.  Look at this fucking...  I'm an ass man.  He's got tears.  You're doing like a real show and talking about soda beer.  I don't know.  I don't know.  And ass man is fighting.  Eric won't turn off ass.  And he's laughing.  He's basically saying, shut up, stupid.  No one gives a fuck about your Pop-Tarts.  Fuck.  And your love for them.  Get to the wrestling.  But more people care about the Pop-Tarts than care about the ass man. 
[02:49:00]  I'm the ass man.  But my point...  You know, I struggle with my own shit that I like to eat.  And I could see that...  You know, I did try the alternative.  It sucks.  I went back to the regular.  Yeah.  And I could see a lot of people doing that until they really figure out how to make things  taste way better and be more...  People have been trying to do that for years.  Something tastes good, but it's healthy.  Don't work.  They've never come up with it. 
[02:49:30]  Right.  I mean, there's tolerable tasty...  Turkey bacon?  No.  Oh, fuck yourself.  I tried that, too, because I'm like, I love bacon.  Oh.  I tried it.  I don't like it.  And I went back to the...  What?  Bacon's good.  You like turkey bacon?  Pork chops are good.  No.  I like apple smoked thick-cut bacon.  There you go.  Better be one shaman motherfucking pig, like that Arnold from Green Acres.  Yes.  I went back to regular bacon, but I did try the alternative that seemed a bit healthier for you.  I sample everything.  Right.  Someday, I think they'll figure it out with the chemicals and shit. 
[02:50:00]  They'll figure out something.  Yeah, they have some transparies.  Some of the sugar substitutes are getting way better.  Yeah.  But they're deadly, right?  Yeah, that's the problem.  You're trading one fucking problem for another problem.  They said Splenda will make you gain weight.  What happened?  Splenda makes you gain weight.  Yeah, but they've got other shit.  Yeah.  So I just cut the sugar.  Just cut the middle man out.  Cut the middle man out.  Cut the middle man out.  Would you drink less soda because of a soda ban?  I never drink soda.  I just drink club soda.  Really? 
[02:50:30]  Yeah.  Just damn booze.  Why not soda?  I don't like soda.  I love club soda.  See, you're different than other people.  You really enjoy your food, but like...  Oh, yeah.  You'll spend money on your food, like more money.  Other people will just go to fast food joints and stuff.  It makes me sad when they do.  You search out really good tasting shit that is really, really bad for you.  But if you're going to be...  Yeah, if you're going to get a steak, put the butter sauce on it.  I mean...  Garlic butter sauce?  Oh, yeah.  And then the warm bread on the table. 
[02:51:00]  Then your appetizer.  Then your second appetizer.  I've had the butter on the steak argument with a lot of people, man.  I'm not a big fan of the butter on the steak.  No, I love steak.  And a good solid piece of steak, you don't need to do...  Yeah, you don't need no butter on that.  You don't have to do that.  Sometimes they put big cheese on top.  I've had Fred, one of my friends out there on Long Island, old fraternity brother, still  in touch with, he will butter up the steak before he cooks it.  That's correct.  And he actually will poke some holes, like, kind of... 
[02:51:30]  So the butter gets in there.  And shove the butter in a little bit.  Get it in there, that fucking butter.  It makes it that much better?  Because steak in general is great.  Or you can inject it with your marinade and then let it...  Marinate.  Marinate.  No!  And throw it on the grill, so he cut us all juicy and happy.  Going to cry again?  Not over that one.  I didn't even notice he was playing Ass Man.  I was very passionate about what I was talking about.  Yeah, he can't stop.  You know how Vince McMahon eats his steak? 
[02:52:00]  He covers it in ketchup.  Why?  He loves ketchup.  How do you know?  I learned all kinds of things from all kinds of people.  Wow.  Really?  Well, Vince McMahon is an asshole.  I talked to somebody in the know.  Why do you say that?  Well, because his son left him.  Let's start there.  What happened?  Well, he wanted to start a different business.  Yeah?  Yeah.  He's trying to watch pay-per-view in China.  Is that where he is?  Yes.  He couldn't be further away from his father.  Vince is a very interesting individual. 
[02:52:30]  He is.  And we continue to promote his product.  It's a great product.  So, anyway, we're going to do a little wrestling thing here.  There's a new storyline with this wrestler called Fandango.  Fandango.  Fandango.  And I was turned on to this about a week ago because it was so stupid.  I was like, this is ridiculous.  Wrestling is so ridiculous.  Now I know why I don't watch.  But then after I turned off the program, I was like, it sunk in. 
[02:53:00]  You're right.  It just fucking grabbed hold of me.  And now I'm all in with Fandango.  Fandango.  But that's why you watch because of the sheer ridiculousness of it.  Yeah.  What I saw last week, I didn't see last night, but we have a clip.  I saw a wrestler come out to wrestle, but he didn't wrestle because no one says his name right.  And did you notice his gimmick?  What?  He was like a dancer.  Yeah.  Like a Dancing with the Stars ballroom dancer.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's him.  Yeah.  They call him out for his matches. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  Why is he allowed to show up?  He hasn't debuted yet.  Because I'm a big fan of wrestling being real.  So wouldn't Vince fire this guy because he's not wrestling?  Mm-hmm.  No.  I mean, I guess it's up to him, right?  Yeah.  He's decided he will wrestle when someone says his name right.  Well, maybe then Vince would say, no, you have to wrestle.  And he'd go, no, you have to make sure these ring announcers say my name correctly.  Right.  Last night, it was even further.  Somebody called him out.  His opponent called him out.  Right. 
[02:54:00]  But his opponent didn't say his name right when he called him out, so.  Should we play the clip from there or over here?  This way.  This is a little longer, but it's got the visual.  Yeah.  I got to see the visual.  Okay.  We can cut it off at any time.  Okay.  From last night.  WWE.  Uh-oh.  I've been waiting for this.  King is still there.  Everyone has to wait around for this guy to show up.  I don't know why Justin's looking so puzzled.  He didn't say it right. 
[02:54:30]  Everybody's compared that wrestler to Bobby Kelly.  Get out here now!  Oh, he doesn't even come out because the guy didn't say his name right.  Uh-oh.  Whose music is that?  I don't know.  Listen to this fuck.  The dancer comes out.  This female dance partner comes out and shakes her shit.  Doing that Spanish dance.  You see they build a wooden dance floor on the ramp for him?  It's hilarious.  The heat this guy's getting. 
[02:55:00]  There he is!  And now he's coming out.  He's sashaying out as a ballroom dancer.  He's like Rico Suave.  He loves this guy.  I just love to say that.  What a gimmick.  No, no, no, Tenzai, you mispronounced my name.  They don't like him.  They boo him.  Of course.  And on top of that, you are a disgrace to the world of dance. 
[02:55:30]  Even the people here in the Midwest who don't know anything about the world of arts will agree  that you two are an abomination. 
[02:56:00]  I'll come down to the ring when you get my name right.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Not you, Joshua.  Not you, Joshua.  It's not his name, by the way.  I want to hear my name spoken through the beautiful, sensual lips of the Funkadaptor. 
[02:56:30]  I have to go through all this just to go to the ring.  I know.  It's so dumb.  She's the only one out there with any rhythm and talents, baby.  Can you imagine this being put up with in any form of sports?  No.  So someone knew he was going to attempt his name?  The chick has to say it, he says. 
[02:57:00]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I will not listen to you say my name.  Congratulations, Tenzai.  You just cost everyone a chance to witness a match with...  Here it goes.  He dips her.  Fun.  Done. 
[02:57:30]  Goal.  Get the fuck out of here.  He doesn't wrestle again.  He doesn't wrestle.  No, he's done.  This guy doesn't wrestle.  He's done for the night.  Dude, it's fucking funny.  That's a funny gimmick.  I think it is.  I think it's one of the better ones.  It's so stupid.  It's so dumb.  It's just so dumb.  It's hilarious.  Yeah.  And it doesn't matter who it is.  Like, his first time ever on television, they were like, when we get back, he's going  to debut. 
[02:58:00]  And they do like a backstage interview with him.  Yeah.  But the backstage interviewer didn't say his name right.  Right.  So he said, I'm not going out there.  Don't do that.  Don't go out.  I'm not wrestling tonight.  Too funny.  That's stupid.  Too fucking funny.  And then there was another clip worth playing real fast.  This next clip is under a minute, so...  Based on...  And we said it on the show.  Your thoughts of Vince McMahon?  Yeah.  We said it on the show.  Can I give it away a little bit?  Sure.  Paul Bearer died.  Yeah.  You know, he used to be the Undertaker's guy, right? 
[02:58:30]  Mm-hmm.  And we said on this very show, watch Vince make it into a storyline.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So they start...  And did he?  Well, they start the show, and it's a full video tribute to Paul Bearer, and it's showing  all of his stuff and everything, everything he did.  And then they go to the live show, The Ring, and The Undertaker comes out.  Mm-hmm.  And he doesn't wrestle anymore, but he's wrestling at WrestleMania.  So The Undertaker comes out.  He walks to The Ring.  There's an urn in The Ring, and it's all set up. 
[02:59:00]  It's obviously a tribute to Paul Bearer.  Uh-huh.  And The Undertaker just sits there bowing his head at the urn.  He's sad?  Right.  Was The Undertaker?  Yeah.  Everybody's, you know, clapping.  Uh-huh.  It's like a ten-bell salute.  Uh-huh.  And then CM Punk interrupted.  Oh, my gosh.  But the guy really died.  Do you think CM Punk did that of his own accord?  Do you think it was a storyline that Vince came up with?  Well, CM Punk's music and video came on.  Yeah, so I guess it was.  So everyone was in.  I guess everyone knew.  Oh, my God.  We got the video clip there? 
[02:59:30]  Is that hilarious?  Uh, yeah.  Yeah, here's CM Punk interrupting The Undertaker's tribute to Paul Bearer, who's actually dead.  Yeah.  He's really dead.  Yeah, this is not a story line.  Right.  Simmer down, simmer down.  John, I think you misunderstand me coming out here.  Oh, jeez.  Wow.  The Undertaker's old.  Wow.  I wanted to come out here and extend personally my heartfelt condolences. 
[03:00:00]  I want to extend my heartfelt apologies for your loss at WrestleMania.  No!  Oh!  Oh!  Using Paul Bearer's death to hype up his WrestleMania match as The Undertaker.  Oh, my God.  The silver lining in all of this tragedy is that to Paul Bearer, you will always be perfect. 
[03:00:30]  You will always be 20-0.  Because he's dead.  Right.  To everybody else.  He earns in the middle of the ring on a velvet-covered table.  All right.  Everybody's like, isn't the guy really dead?  Wait, wait.  Is he going to come out?  And the night after WrestleMania, we won't be playing any heartfelt tributes to Paul Bearer. 
[03:01:00]  We're going to be showing a new video.  A video about me and everybody who's here now.  Wait.  He's dead.  If you show up to WrestleMania, you're going to be at your home.  In 50 years, your grandchildren will be asking you where you were when CM Punk beat the street.  I don't think so.  Wow.  So he interrupts a real fucking...  So is Paul Bearer going to be at WrestleMania?  Is that it? 
[03:01:30]  Is that the gimmick?  Is he fake dead?  He comes back and...  You're missing the...  He's dead.  Yeah, that's funny.  I know.  Right.  Like as a human being?  Like Vince when he blew up in the limo.  Right.  No, the person who played Paul Bearer on television passed away this week.  So he's going to be at WrestleMania.  How do we know?  How do we know?  Well, you know damn well Vince is in a back room somewhere trying to find a Paul Bearer lookalike.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You think Vince was happy when we heard about Paul Bearer?  This.  This is great.  Just in time for the... 
[03:02:00]  Yeah, this is going to be great.  I think we found one in Wisconsin.  I think it's going to be good.  Paul Bearer in Wisconsin.  This is the best thing that could have happened for WrestleMania.  You get out there and you tribute him, Undertaker.  You tribute him.  You're going to get interrupted.  And then Punk's going to come out and interrupt your real touching tribute.  Yeah.  By the way, his real ashes are going to be in that urn.  Well, Vince, I don't think that's a good...  I don't give a damn what you think.  I own him alive or dead. 
[03:02:30]  It's going to say Paul Bearer on his tombstone.  And that means I own that tombstone, damn it.  I own it.  Great.  Twisted.  Oh, fuck.  There you go.  That's a wrestling update for everybody.  I wonder if Vince will allow people to be considered Paul Bearers at Paul Bearer's funeral.  Or will he say, no, I own the name.  I own the name.  You're called casket lifters.  God, he doesn't care. 
[03:03:00]  He's a true showbiz guy.  The show must go on kind of guy.  That's the way Paul Bearer would have wanted it.  That's probably what he tells everyone.  And what are you going to do, ask him?  Yeah, yeah.  You know, me and Paul spoke once, back ten years ago, and he told me if anything ever  happened to him, he'd want to continue in the ring dead.  Did he, Vince?  I bet he did.  No chance in here. 
[03:03:30]  No chance.  We didn't talk about Justin Bieber yesterday.  Tough guy?  Tough guy Bieber?  Is that the one?  We're hanging with the younger demos right now.  Oh, yeah.  Might as well go younger.  But stupid tough guy Bieber.  Hey, tough guy.  We didn't break down that clip of him jumping out of the car, going after the paparazzi.  That kind of, what, bumped into him or something?  And don't make me come over there for you, too, tough guy.  Well, what happened was he was getting rushed out of, like, a hospital in England, I guess 
[03:04:00]  is where he was.  Oh, for the fake illness.  Well, when he was exhausted.  Exhausted.  Yeah.  And took that sexy photo.  I've been breaking this down.  Yeah.  He's an asshole.  He might be on something.  We don't know.  He's two hours late for that concert in London.  That pisses off his young fan base, especially the parents who are going to be the ones that  buy all the Justin Bieber product.  You've got a whole bunch of people leaving the show before the guy even came on because  they have to get up for school and whatnot.  So he got horrendously bad press. 
[03:04:30]  Next day, he's fainting on stage.  Yeah.  That's the combat.  A little sympathy.  The horrendous press he was getting to turn everybody around.  It's so obvious.  But no one in the mainstream media even brings it up as a possibility.  But they cared enough to actually tell the story that he fainted.  Right.  But now one of these talking heads, and every channel has him now, didn't say, you know  what?  I'm suspicious of this.  You know?  He got all that bad press.  And now, you know, you faint in front of your fan base like that. 
[03:05:00]  And you go to the hospital.  You take pictures from the hospital.  That's going to turn around the bad press because now it's going to be kind of good press.  A bunch of sympathy.  Sympathy press.  I think he's trying to change his image.  I think it backfired.  I think he's trying to get a little more of a tough guy.  Right.  But it looked so stupid.  Really stupid.  Yeah, he didn't look like a tough guy at all.  You can't jump out of a big black suburban or whatever the hell.  And then say you're going to beat the shit out of a paparazzi guy.  A guy that...  He was huge.  One look at him, he's a big fucking...  Melon head.  He's a big fucking problem. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah.  If it was a real fight between the paparazzi guy and Justin Bieber, he would probably take  his head right off his body and roll it down the street like a bowling ball.  Yeah, he was like, hold me back.  Hold me back to his security staff.  Right.  Hey, look out.  And Bieber was playing that old gag where you want to act tough, but you don't actually  want to be in a fight because you know you don't even have a fucking chance, so you make  sure you stay behind the big bouncer.  And he didn't look like a tough guy.  You stayed behind your security guy.  He looked like a little wimpy kid having a little temper tantrum instead of a man going 
[03:06:00]  like, oh, he's calling that guy out.  He's fucking showing him.  Right.  He looked like a little boy who didn't get what he wanted.  Did you see the tweet?  I got to start saving all these tweets because I never know when they're going to come up  on the show.  Someone took the picture of Bieber's security guy or bouncer or whatever the fuck you want  to call him and trying to put him back in the car.  Yeah.  It looks like you're putting a child into a car seat. 
[03:06:30]  Into a car seat.  There.  It went around.  It was viral.  Yeah.  It was so fucking funny.  If someone has that, I'll retweet it.  Can you find it real fast, possibly?  Holding him like a baby.  Yeah.  Apparently a lot of people have seen it.  He lifted him up like a baby because he really is a small kid still.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And what's with that gas mask thing?  Is that a Michael Jackson-ish?  It's the Madonna shit.  Kind of.  Oh, my God.  Oh, there it is.  Oh, that is adorable.  Look at his pants sagging like a little baby boy.  He looks like...  But that's how I put my kid in the car. 
[03:07:00]  You take your hands and you put them under each underarm.  That's hilarious.  And then you lift him up and put him in his car seat.  That's what it looks like.  That looks real bad.  And that isn't even forced perspective.  No.  He's just a big guy holding a little guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He lifted him up off the ground.  That's adorable.  Isn't that funny?  No amount of tats.  No amount of wacky gangster clothes that he could put on is going to take away from the  fact that he's a little baby-faced boy that is on the end of this little fame with teeny 
[03:07:30]  boppers.  Have you seen him in person, Sam?  Oh, do tell.  I'm not sure.  I know who has.  Steve Blatter.  Steve Blatter.  Got a picture with him, by the way.  Really?  We've all seen that picture.  Holy shit.  That look is the creepiest fucking photo.  Look at his face.  He's with little Justin Bieber.  That's Justin Bieber only a couple years ago, right?  Yeah.  Holy fuck. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah, that's when he still had the Bieber cut.  Yeah, he had the Bieber hair and he has not a hint of a muscle or a tattoo on him.  He's a little kid.  Holy fuck.  Yeah, he's small, man.  Yeah, he's tiny.  Tiny little guy.  He wants to be a big, tough guy.  I think he wants to be Justin Timberlake.  That's exactly what he wants to be.  Isn't that like his goal is like, all right, I did that.  We had the whole teen heartthrob thing.  But now I'm going to act.  I'm going to sing.  I'm still going to fucking be relevant.  I know America loves Justin Timberlake, but I can't. 
[03:08:30]  What?  JT.  JT.  I can't get past the lisps.  Really?  The lisps.  He lisps through everything now.  What kind of lisp does he have?  This one?  This one?  This one?  This one?  Kind of effeminate.  Yeah?  Tennessee thing, maybe.  Tennessee lisp.  You think he's lighting the loafers?  He's fucking grabbed some pretty righteous pussy in his day.  He looks like he's got a little light.  Married to Jessica Biel.  Yeah, Jessica fucking Biel. 
[03:09:00]  He's on SNL and everyone's saying how great he is, but his lispy, effeminate voice is a  little strange to me.  Jessica Biel, who was in fucking Hitchcock.  She was in Hitchcock with fucking, what's her name, the other one?  Scarlett.  Scarlett Johansson.  Joe Hanson.  Were they lesing out?  Both of them.  Were they bumping donuts?  No lesing out.  Fuck, why couldn't they write that scene into the movie?  I don't think Mr. Hitchcock would have minded a little lesing out.  Good evening.  Why couldn't the shower scene be two broads lesing out and it just so happens the one went 
[03:09:30]  to get some towels and that's when the shit happened with the knife.  Scarlett Johansson in the shower.  That was the scene.  Was she naked?  Well, you didn't see.  But we all saw her boobs when they were, you know.  They kind of showed it like Psycho, you know, where you didn't really see it.  Alfred Hitchcock would have understood if you updated the film.  Just call me Hitch, you can hold the cock.  That's what he said to Tony Perkins, who was gay.  Anthony Perkins, you know, he was gay. 
[03:10:00]  Rumors, Mr. Hitchcock might have had a little taste.  Alfred Hitchcock was weird.  Like, he had his wife, I guess?  And he had kids or something?  I don't know.  But he seems a little weird.  A true artist?  Seems a little odd.  True artist like Fandango.  But you're talking about no lesing out at all?  Goal.  No les.  No les.  Hitchcock was, uh...  Hitchcock always, like, apparently fell in love with his leading ladies, so...  I don't think he was a homo. 
[03:10:30]  He was just a weird kind of guy.  Summo?  And now a word from our sponsor.  I just love watching that show.  Yeah.  The music would always skip because the film was so old and cracking on Channel 5 years ago when I would watch it.  And it would start...  Always skipping.  Oh, really?  Made me laugh every time.  Yeah, because the film was so fucked up. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah.  This just reminds me, it's like, it's two in the morning.  I'm watching this.  Good evening.  Sitting on the couch.  Mommy isn't home from work yet.  Wow.  Two in the morning?  Yeah, she worked at, uh, you know, the disco.  That's what they called it back then?  The disco?  The disco.  She was busy fucking serving drinks to Cokeheads.  Did she have to wear hot pants?  My mom had to dress like a slut for, uh, work.  Holy shit. 
[03:11:30]  She used to leave the house and I'm like, really?  You're a waitress at the disco or a fucking prostitute?  Oh my God.  She'd wear, like, go-go boots and fucking mini skirts and shit.  Wow.  And shit.  Fuck a load of, like, uh, you know, wore makeup on and shit.  But she would, uh, you know, hey.  She'd be getting them tips.  That's for sure.  I got very good news.  Just came in.  Ah, no meeting.  Thank God.  Our meeting got canceled.  Kenny, could I?  I did not.  He just wrote me.  No way.  Yeah.  Stop.  You're fucking getting me all excited. 
[03:12:00]  No way.  Because he would have come in here.  All right.  G-Unit.  Now we have to meet.  What is he doing with G-Unit?  Why is Steve Black...  He looks, like, so out of place in every one of his photos.  He looks like a victim there.  But he's trying to be, like, one of the guys.  He's got a hoodie on.  But Blatter, I don't know what...  I don't know what he finds fun.  I don't know what he does for enjoyment.  Hmm.  That's a good question.  Maybe we'll ask in the meeting. 
[03:12:30]  No, that means the meeting will take longer.  Oh, right.  Speaking of which, we gotta get down the hall.  Oh, fuck yeah.  I'm not staying any later.  Is it really 10 o'clock already?  That show flew by.  You know what you guys should do?  What?  You should stand outside the meeting and make them pronounce your names correctly.  Or we don't do the meeting.  Or you don't go into the meeting.  And then you say at the end, you just cost yourselves an opportunity to have a meeting with...  To meet with...  O-P-N.  Antony.  Like that. 
[03:13:00]  Antony.  Oh, that would be great.  It could work.  I wish.  How'd they do O-P?  O-P.  O-P.  And Antony.  Antony.  You did not say it right.  All right, y'all.  All right.  We had fun.  Sam will do the after show today.  And let's not forget, our pal Jim Norton's going to be on Leno tonight.  Let's all watch, okay?  You know who's going to be on the after show today?  Oh.  Mr. Wonderful from Shark Tank.  Oh. 
[03:13:30]  Really?  You watch Shark Tank?  Yeah.  On the last Shark Tank, some guy came in with an idea that was so bad, Mr. Wonderful said  that he wanted them to catch on fire.  Oh.  So I'll ask him about that.  Wait, which one's Mr. Wonderful?  He's the bald dude.  He's the mean one.  Wait, you're talking to him today?  Yep.  I got a couple ideas I want to run by that guy.  Skip the meeting.  Yeah, that'll happen.  I bet he never gets pissed.  He's the hedge fund guy.  He's worth like $4 billion.  He sold his software company, I think.  That's correct. 
[03:14:00]  See, I know a little bit about the Shark Tank.  Mm-mm.  Yeah.  I think Jesse May Peluso stopped him by, too.  Who?  Jesse May Peluso.  What's that?  Is she like your sidekick now?  She hasn't been on the show since December.  Oh, is she the girl that wore the tight?  Yeah, with the ass.  Yeah, she had a nice ass.  She's got an ass man.  She had little stretchy pants on.  All right.  I'm an ass man!  Da-da!  We'll see you tomorrow.  Later!  Yeah, I'm an ass man!  Yeah!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues. 
[03:14:30]  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts. 
[03:15:00]  Yeah!  I'm trying to get these headphones worked out.  They're doing the thing where you've got to jostle them.  Because they can only hear out of one ear.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  These pieces of shits.  Ah, there it is.  Is it going to stay?  No.  Let me try to bend it a little bit.  After Opie and Anthony Live show, on this Tuesday, whatever, 866-WOW-1-WOW is the phone 
[03:15:30]  number to call.  We do have an Opie Sudoku to give away today.  So, very exciting.  Very exciting.  Very exciting time to be part of the Opie and Anthony show.  E-Rock, you got everybody ramped up on the creative tip today.  Whether that was intentional or not, yes.  Well, you probably weren't planning on bringing up your broadcasting plans today.  No, not at all.  This is what I think.  I think your podcast, this is my statement for the record.  And then I'll leave it alone.  Well, I can't promise I'll leave it alone.  But this is my statement for the record. 
[03:16:00]  You think I'll leave it alone, Sam?  Absolutely not.  Okay.  Well, then I'm not going to promise that, okay?  Because I don't want to lie.  But, I think your podcast will be successful.  I think people will enjoy it.  People like hearing what you have on your mind.  If I could offer you any advice, I would say combine all your ideas.  At least to start, combine all your ideas.  Because E-Rock went on the air today and said he was going to do four podcasts.  He's going to start the Nagel Network, which would be the greatest podcast network of all time. 
[03:16:30]  That's what he called it, the Nagel Network.  No, I never called it a network, nor the Nagel Network.  You didn't say Nagel Network?  No, both of those were yours.  Huh.  Well, then I'd still go with Nagel Network.  I think it's a good idea.  But, you want to do a Simpsons podcast, and a podcast with your friends, and a podcast by yourself, and...  What was the fourth one?  About the radio industry.  Oh, right.  And a podcast with radio people.  Oh, there already is a Nagel Network?  Yeah, we can't get the domain name.  Ah, shit.  Nagel Network is Nagelcast?  If it's not in this country, I can.  Oh, yes.  Hmm. 
[03:17:00]  Okay.  Well, here's what I'm thinking.  All those ideas, at least to start, should be just combined into one podcast.  E-Rock's World.  Yeah.  Something like that.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  I think that would be the way to go.  It's the same way, like, I don't do a wrestling podcast, but I interviewed Superfly Jimmy Snuka.  And one week, I just threw that up as a podcast.  The next week, I was by myself again.  You know, it doesn't really matter, because you're just in there doing your thing.  But the other thing is, don't worry about figuring out a fancy website.  Don't worry about this or that. 
[03:17:30]  Get it on iTunes first.  Well, I wanted to, but I need to get hosting and everything.  I have to provide it to iTunes.  Hosting's easy.  I mean, hosting you could get today.  You just need to sign up.  It's like 14 bucks a month.  Yeah.  You know, hosting.  Just sign up for a hosting package, upload your shit, and send it to iTunes, and figure out the rest later.  And then as you grow, you know what I mean?  And then, like, let's say, you know, once you realize, oh, this is really taking off, you can start separating the podcast.  It's something new for people to be excited about.  Or, you know, podcast number five, now we're announcing that we're launching a website to go along with the podcast. 
[03:18:00]  Oh, it's something cool, you know?  Yeah.  That's what I would do.  Yeah, that was the advice I was given during the break from both Opie and Anthony, to combine it into one.  And was I in here during the break?  No, you weren't, actually.  Three radio geniuses.  What can I say?  What can I say?  But will you admit that I'm a genius, at least?  No, I'll never do that.  No, you won't, will you?  You son of a bitch.  How are you doing, Troy?  Good.  Wouldn't you want to make sure that one podcast, like, people actually gave a shit and cared about what you were saying? 
[03:18:30]  No.  And do what?  And instead of just diving into four podcasts?  I would say my, I think you should do one instead of diving into four, yes.  But I don't think you should spend too much time making sure that people give a shit.  Because the whole idea of podcasting is you put out there what you want to put out there, and if it finds the audience, it does.  And if it doesn't, then it doesn't.  And that's what it is.  Like, anybody who podcasts strategically has lost it. 
[03:19:00]  You know what I mean?  You shouldn't be podcasting strategically.  You should just be putting it out there for the world.  If they like it, then they like it.  Imagine thinking you have so much content in your head.  There's so much that the world needs to know that you need to do four podcasts.  Like, the world needs to know all of this.  Oh, boy.  There's some venom here, Eric.  No, there's no venom.  I'm sensing this.  No, no.  You get the venom, right?  I tried to make clear that when I was yelling at you on the air today and we got into our squabble,  my frustrations were more the same frustrations that I have with Roland. 
[03:19:30]  The same frustrations that I've had with Sal, just to do it.  I'm not saying it's going to suck, and I'm not saying it's a bad idea.  I'm saying I get frustrated when people talk, and I feel like it just never happens.  And it'd be so easy to just make it happen.  And that's the kind of Nagel philosophy, right?  I'm not taking shots at Eric.  Eric, you see what's going on here, don't you?  Why was he in here?  Let's go on.  He's got an opinion.  Yeah, because I have an opinion.  And Sam says that this is an open forum. 
[03:20:00]  Anybody can walk it in.  Handsome Johnny Tube Stakes is sitting here.  He hasn't said a word yet.  I'm enjoying the ride.  Good.  This is great.  Anybody can walk in at any time and say whatever they have to say.  Exactly.  Including Mr. Wonderful from Shark Tank.  He'll do that in a little bit.  But I forgot what I was going to say.  You were talking about E-Rock and his mantra being talk, not do.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, it's like the movie.  It's like, what's the timeline?  When can we expect an honest timeline of when there will be a podcast up?  You can't rush Genius, Troy. 
[03:20:30]  Or a movie script.  Because it's like, all this stuff is coming.  It's like, that's great.  But it's like, when will it actually happen?  I'm going to guess Eric's answer.  Go ahead.  None of your business.  Yeah.  That's a big bingo.  That's just like, that's his easy way out.  Because I'm going to guess Eric's response to you again.  I don't have to explain shit to you.  Is that it, Eric?  Double bingo.  I got it.  I know my buddy.  I know Eric.  But see, the thing is, when you say you're going to keep doing stuff and keep doing stuff, 
[03:21:00]  you know that you just look like an asshole when it never comes out.  Yeah.  I also look like an asshole when I didn't bring it up.  Hmm?  What?  Everybody else brings it up when I didn't bring it up because I wasn't ready.  Oh.  Well, yeah.  Well, you didn't have to go on the air with it on Dave's show the other day and talk about it.  That's true.  I didn't.  Dave brought it up.  Dave brought up your podcast?  Yes, he did.  He brought up four podcasts that you're going to be doing.  Barry brought up.  To be fair.  Yes, he did.  Eric told off the air, he said...  He was in passing.  Right.  He said to Dave, hey, I'm... 
[03:21:30]  Because I think he was talking to Dave about maybe doing the radio podcast, correct?  Yeah, we were talking about Riotcast and stuff like that.  Right.  And he was saying, yeah, I'm thinking about launching some podcasts of my own.  And he told him off the air.  And then the minute Dave's...  And that was weeks ago.  Right.  That was at the Patrice benefit.  Right.  And then the minute that Dave saw him in a studio, he was like, so Eric, you're doing four  podcasts.  Tell me about this.  And then Eric spilled his guts.  And there's a lot of guts to spill.  I think...  I think...  You get that one, Eric?  Yes.  You should play the lottery.  Okay.  I think people just want to see Eric do something.  I think so, too.  Like, just something. 
[03:22:00]  It's common.  Like, a radio show on the channel that he works on.  Well, we got one.  We almost got two.  You got bumped, though.  You got bumped.  It's like pot...  It's like the smoothie script.  It's like, okay.  Really?  All right.  Eric, do you feel like giving a timeline for your podcast or no?  Um...  What are we thinking?  Within a few weeks.  Within a few weeks, Troy.  So what's a few weeks?  A month?  I would say...  Are you paying for this?  Then shut the fuck up.  Whoa!  He's trying to get the out when it's out.  He's trying to get that paper. 
[03:22:30]  It's going to be...  You're going to put it on free anyway, right?  Yeah.  Okay, so what would I fucking pay for it, you stupid fat fuck?  Why would I have to answer to you, then, on this?  Because I'm in here asking questions.  Fuck you.  I'm in here asking for something you don't care about.  Yeah, because you're a fucking lazy fuck, that's why.  Oh, there it goes.  You want to attack me, I'll start attacking you, you fat fuck.  Seems like you were attacking me coming in here.  I'm just asking questions.  Okay.  Well, but you implied he was an asshole.  Well, I imply that he fucking says a lot of shit that he doesn't ever fucking follow  through on.  And this affects you how?  Because I work with you, and I have to see you're fucking lazy and incompetent, so 
[03:23:00]  I want to call you out on it while you have the opportunity to.  What else do you hate, Troy?  Get it all out.  This is sort of a podcast right here.  This is great.  Your fucking fat tits.  I hate them.  Okay.  Your fucking laziness.  Okay.  You're fucking stinking up the bathroom every goddamn morning.  Yeah, right.  Do you stink up the bathroom?  No, I don't.  You stopped doing that as much, right?  Because you figured out your intestinal deal.  Yeah.  Man, we haven't had this Troy and E-Rock argument in a while.  It's been months.  We've been doing good.  Yeah, but he doesn't attack anybody else when they ask him a question. 
[03:23:30]  Everybody goofs on him all morning.  I was attacked.  And he sits there and opens up his fucking fat butthole.  I don't think he was listening.  Everybody fuck him in it all the time.  And then I come in here, and then he has the balls to stand up to me all of a sudden.  I was amazed you were listening, because when they were talking about you on Saturday  night, you didn't come in when we tried calling you to come in.  Because they didn't call me in.  We were trying to call you.  You didn't answer.  I'm in the bathroom.  I don't have a fucking radio with me.  Stinking up the bathroom.  Stinking up the bathroom.  I did take a dump this morning.  I mean, Eric did it.  They didn't call me.  I didn't hear it.  You could have easily fucking, when I walked by, or somebody could have grabbed me and  said, oh, yo, they're asking for you. 
[03:24:00]  Eric did attack me this morning.  I mean, I was okay with it, but you know, I was taking some shots.  He took some shots back, right, Sal?  Oh, yeah.  You were here.  Yeah.  Are you okay?  I'm okay.  I'm okay.  Okay.  You know, I can handle it.  That's good.  Not to say that you can't.  That wasn't a shot at you.  Johnny will get used to this.  You shifting the focus over to Sal and Johnny?  Yeah, let's get back to what's going on with Troy and Eric here.  It's been a while since we had the Troy frustrated with Eric, Eric, Eric, tell me what else you  hate about me, Troy, and then Troy going off argument. 
[03:24:30]  Yeah, I mean, you want me to fucking unload that.  That used to happen every three weeks on the after show.  Because I used to always remember Eric's response was always like, yeah, what else do you hate  about me?  And then Troy would unload every time.  It's been a while.  So, and then, and then, ah, late clockwork.  Kevin in Houston.  Hey, boys.  How you doing?  What's up, buddy?  I think I figured it out.  Troy Kwan is just jealous of D-Rock.  For what, though?  What would I be jealous of?  And if you explain to me what, and have a good point of why I'd be jealous, explain it. 
[03:25:00]  He's married.  He has a huge house.  Married?  Why would I give a fuck about being married?  He's a guy.  Yes.  He's got toys and comic books.  I don't give a fuck about comic books.  But toys is nice.  What kind of toys?  Legos?  I don't give a fuck about Legos.  You don't?  No.  What else?  I just think you're jealous of D-Rock.  Yeah, but explain it, dude.  Explain it.  Tell me.  And if you're right, I'll admit to it.  Nobody.  How old are you?  You're what, 36, 37?  35.  Okay, I'm 35.  Just about 36. 
[03:25:30]  No.  Any time during my day do I go to one of my coworkers or friends and personally attack  them the way that you do.  Yeah, but you understand that I have a coworker that constantly says things are going to happen  and that nothing happens and everybody knows that.  But that's your business.  And you've never had a coworker?  Yo, dude.  You've never had a coworker that was just sometimes just an idiot on the job and you'd goof on  him?  Oh, absolutely.  Oh, okay.  Well, then why are you not a fucking asshole, too?  Are you jealous of your coworker? 
[03:26:00]  Let me go to Tony in Chicago.  It sounds like to me that Troy, every time Troy gets a little, somebody says something  funny to Troy, he snaps like a little bitch.  Well, it's Eric.  Eric gets Eric.  He brings the bitch out in you?  Well, it's just, he just, because he doesn't attack, he doesn't attack anybody else.  Oh, he attacked me.  Yeah, but it wasn't, he doesn't go after you like he goes after me.  I don't know.  I mean, Eric didn't really barely go after you just now and you fucking went off on him.  Because he just, he does that like cocky, no, you're fucking vicious. 
[03:26:30]  And he went off on me today, didn't he, Sal?  Yeah, Troy, you did, you did initially attack Eric.  Eric didn't say anything to you.  I mean, to Eric's, to Eric's credit, you came in here and right off the bat implied  that he was a stupid asshole.  Well, no, because I have the question.  Correct, Johnny Toobstake?  You started with bang.  But he, he comes and he says all these things are going to happen and nothing happens.  I just want to just be like, dude, this is what you say is always going to happen  and it never happens.  You just want to shake him.  Let me go to, let me go to Dave because I think he, he might have a good, Sal is sitting 
[03:27:00]  here so happy that this all went down because I was going to talk to Sal about the upcoming  trade, but Dave in Massachusetts, what's up, buddy?  I know why Troy is jealous of E-Rock.  It's because E-Rock is respected not just by Opie and Anthony, but by the company.  He has earned that respect and it is the respect that Troy has not yet achieved.  It may not ever achieve.  I don't know if I agree with that.  It's anger in your voice.  I don't know if I agree with that, sir.  Why would you say they're respected? 
[03:27:30]  I mean, from Opie and Anthony, I mean, they're constantly ripping on him every day.  Apparently you haven't listened to the show for as many years as I have.  Oh, apparently not.  Okay.  Maybe you're right.  I don't know if that's the case why I think the things I do with Eric, but I mean, I'm  sure if he's been with the show for what, eight, nine years?  Nine years.  Okay.  Nine years.  So yeah, probably if he was that loyal, you're probably right.  And 90 pounds.  That's not necessary.  You're right.  I'm sorry.  Dave in Tennessee. 
[03:28:00]  The reason he's jealous is because he's jealous.  Who is?  Eric's jealous of Troy?  No, no, no.  Troy's absolutely jealous of E-Rock.  And the reason is because he sees himself as much more talented and much more deserving  of what E-Rock has.  He's jealous of all you guys.  Troy is.  He knows he doesn't have near the talent of anyone there, but he does think he has more  talent than E-Rock.  And that eats at him.  He can't fucking take it.  He's a douchebag.  I don't get why he's even on the air.  Ever.  He's talking about you, Troy.  Yeah, that's fine. 
[03:28:30]  Are you a douchebag?  Yeah.  You are?  I can be a douchebag, sure.  Are you jealous of Eric's talent?  But I don't know what is his talent, though.  Well, are you jealous that he gets the spotlight on him more than you, and you think that you  are more talented?  I mean, we do two totally different things here.  Well, like, what do you do?  I do all the production for the show and the channel.  It's all the stuff you're hearing in and out of fucking commercials and a lot of the  bits were produced by me, written by Sam. 
[03:29:00]  And then what does E-Rock do?  Well, Eric archives, and he runs the board.  It doesn't sound as tough.  I mean, that's the truth.  I mean, it just sounds like Eric's job is a little easier.  Eric's not a producer, and I know how to operate the board.  Right.  I mean, I know how to...  So you're saying you could do Eric's job, but he's not going to be able to pull off yours.  What Eric is good at is he knows the ins and outs of the show.  He knows references.  He knows how to find stuff quick.  I'll give him that credit. 
[03:29:30]  Eric.  And by the way, find stuff quick?  He's pretty good at it.  He's been called out more than a few times.  Well, I mean, but how many times do things go smooth and Eric never gets the credit for  it going smooth?  I guess zero?  Brad in Jersey.  I didn't mean that, Eric.  No, I think you did.  Maybe.  Brad in Jersey.  Yeah, I was just going to say, and I don't hate anybody in the show.  I'm not going to take sides.  But Troy comes across as very bitter.  I don't understand why he cares so much about what Eric's doing or not doing. 
[03:30:00]  Who cares?  It's not your business.  It doesn't relate.  I don't know why he's so angry about it.  Well, I mean, if it comes up on the show, it sort of becomes everybody's business.  I mean, everybody can comment on it if they like.  You do, but you do feel passionate about E-Rock not following through with the projects  that he says that he's working on.  Well, it's just kind of like...  Where does that passion come from is the question.  The thing is, is like, you know, Sam, I mean, you like to call everybody out.  Everybody.  On everything.  It's the no spin zone is what I was thinking about naming this show. 
[03:30:30]  So if I see something that comes up that's not being addressed, it's just fun to bring  it up on the air and start shit.  Yeah.  You know?  I mean, that's just the way it is.  I honestly don't think Troy is jealous of Eric.  I think there's a friendship issue.  Come on in.  Because you guys have been friends for years, right?  Yeah.  Mr. Wonderful is here.  How are you, sir?  You guys can stick around if you want.  Everybody can stick.  Nice to meet you.  You too.  Thank you.  Sam. 
[03:31:00]  Mr. Wonderful Kevin O'Leary from the Shark Tank.  We were having some issues right before you walked in.  We're on the air now.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  And we're having some major issues.  You've been, obviously, you've dealt with a lot of people in business.  I have.  Employees.  This is Troy, the tattooed gentleman to your right.  Eric is in the other room.  These guys are not getting along.  And it's because Troy is saying that Eric doesn't have any follow-through with the stuff that  he says he's going to do.  And I'm sitting here wondering, how does somebody like you, who's at the top of the ladder, deal 
[03:31:30]  with people who would be working under you that can't even get along themselves to get the job done properly?  Wow.  This is one of the core elements of any business.  It's called the executional metrics.  I mean, you know, you have somebody that you're investing in.  I make it real simple.  Give me quarterly targets on what you're going to achieve.  Let's sit down and agree on what they're going to be.  I'll write a check to find your business.  And if you miss them, I'm going to fire you.  It's that simple.  What if it's just like a dumb radio show, though, and they're just squabbling the whole time?  This isn't a dumb radio show, as long as you have an audience. 
[03:32:00]  And maybe the squabbling's part of the patina of what makes this radio show work.  So you're sitting there, and you'd say, okay, well, does the audience like it?  Do the subscriber dollars translate to these guys fighting?  And if so, are you going to fan the flames?  Yeah.  Listen, this is a good thing.  Maybe you should beat them with a stick.  Just start, you know, instigating them to fist fight.  Just full on.  I mean, whatever.  This show works, obviously.  You've got a big audience.  Right.  Something's working here. 
[03:32:30]  And I think probably people tune in to just see how your family works every day.  Maybe it's a little dysfunctional.  Maybe that's why it's interesting to listen to.  And I guess you guys don't exactly pull punches on Shark Tank either, do you?  No.  There's a lot of squabbling that goes on.  Well, there's a lot of ego, a lot of money, and those are real dollars being invested.  So, yeah, the shit hits the fan quite often.  And those are your dollars that you're investing.  Yeah, they are.  And so you've got to look at it this way.  You know, if you think about venture capital, it's very eclectic.  It's serendipitous.  It's luck sometimes.  But if you're a venture investor like I am and the rest of the sharks are, you need a 
[03:33:00]  portfolio of deals because you don't know which ones are going to work.  Right.  Every once in a while, lightning strikes, and that one deal makes all the money for the  dogs you invested in.  You just don't know they're a dog when you're investing in them.  But the process of the investing itself is very interesting because it's real.  You know, a typical venture firm would probably look at 700 deals, maybe throw out 300 because  they don't fit there.  They might not do biotech, for example.  Then they'll work on 100 with earnest, do due diligence, do seven term sheets, and close 
[03:33:30]  three.  Those are the real national stats.  On Shark Tank, we really drill down.  You close a lot more business on our show.  And so if you have an idea, you want to come on and maybe you'll get funded.  You don't know.  And having these diverse investments made me realize, and it brings back to something  we were talking about earlier today.  Say you want to invest.  We were talking about podcasts, right?  Yeah.  So say you want to invest in someone's podcast.  Are you going to invest in the guy who's saying, I have this one idea, it's a weekly podcast, 
[03:34:00]  it's one show, but it encompasses everything?  Or do you like a guy like our producer E-Rock was pitching, who's saying, no, I'm going to  have four different podcasts?  I'd rather have the four.  You would, at launch.  Yeah, I want the diversification, because I don't know with certainty what's going to  work.  The whole thing about investing is diversifying risk.  That's it.  The more you bet on one thing, the more you fail, and you have a higher probability of  making no dollars.  Right.  So will you invest in Eric Nagle's podcast network? 
[03:34:30]  Absolutely not.  Okay.  I'm sorry, E-Rock.  I don't know if you heard that.  You've lost an investor.  He's going to pay.  You're out.  Well, you know, podcasts are notorious for not making any dough.  Right.  Yeah.  Why do I want to go burn money there?  That's a bad idea.  I can find something better than that.  That's the one thing that all podcasts have in common.  None of them make any money.  Exactly.  I was watching this week's episode, or, you know, the one from Friday.  Yeah.  You've never bitten your tongue when you don't like an idea that somebody's pitching. 
[03:35:00]  Right.  But on Friday, the people who were pitching cell phone helmets, or cell helmets, which  first of all, even the name, it should be cell-mits.  That's the Viking one.  The Viking helmet.  Yeah.  It should be cell-mits, not cell helmets.  You told them that you would like to set them on fire because you were so displeased with  their proposal to you.  Could you have not just said, I'm going to choose not to invest with you today?  No, because they're wasting my time, which has value to it.  And I know with certainty that, you know, that is a really bad idea. 
[03:35:30]  And so wouldn't it be better just to take them out behind the barn and get it over with?  Just old yellers shot you under the head.  You know, it's sort of, it was a real, at least the idea, not the people.  But, you know, maybe they, I don't want them wasting their time.  Maybe they could be real entrepreneurs and come up with some things better that I could  make money on.  I'm not trying to make friends on Shark Tank.  I'm trying to make money.  You want a friend by a dog.  Right, right, right.  How quick do you know when a pitch is that bad, bad enough that you want to set someone  on fire, how quick in the pitch do you know this is horrible? 
[03:36:00]  You know, if you look historically at the deals that get financed, you find three attributes  to them.  One is they're able to articulate the idea in 90 seconds or less, and it's brilliant.  They're able to say, look, in one minute, I've told you why you want to invest in this  idea.  And you get it as an investor.  Secondly, they spend a bit of time explaining why they are the right person to execute the  business plan.  And here's the thing that really matters.  They know their numbers.  They know their numbers.  They know their numbers. 
[03:36:30]  If they don't know their numbers, I don't want to invest in them.  But all three of those things come together.  Those are the deals that get done.  So as long as they're going down that path, they get the idea quickly, they explain why  they can execute the idea, and then you're in the part about the numbers, you know there's  a deal cooking there.  Yeah.  And you see that consistently in all the ones that close.  You're very good with numbers.  You're always the first one to know.  I see you.  They're like, well, you want to give you, you know, for 10% of our company, we'll charge  you 250 grand.  You're always the first shark to know exactly how much the company is worth. 
[03:37:00]  Right.  And that's the first test.  If you're a moron and you try and tell me that an idea that has no sales is worth two  and a half million, as in that case would be.  See?  He didn't even have a notepad that time.  That is a person that I am going to personally help understand why that's a mistake.  Uh-huh.  Just answer this question for me, because I always watch, and Barbara, who's the real  estate mogul.  Right.  She's the lady with the short hair.  Yeah, she flies in every day on a broom. 
[03:37:30]  That's right.  Right.  I'm convinced she has no money, because she never invests in anything.  Oh, no, no.  She's invested in a lot of things.  Her specialty is doing food deals.  You know, she did a cake company, and her model's interesting.  She does a lot of stuff.  She just did a lobster thing.  She did a cake thing.  All kinds of food stuff.  She likes that, because she doesn't like, you know, products that are prone to recession.  These, in food, it doesn't matter what's happening in the economy.  People are eating.  So, you know, that's her thing.  Everybody's got their own little space. 
[03:38:00]  If you think about Lori Greiner, she tends to do stuff that she can put onto QVC.  Obviously, Cuban's a tech investor.  So is Herjavec, the other guy.  I'm wide open.  I like financial services.  I like products and services.  I'll do anything that I think I can make money on.  You ever turn something down quick, like saying this is a terrible idea?  And because I've seen you, when other sharks will invest in something, mock them.  Like, what are you doing?  Like, are you just giving your money away?  Has that happened?  Have you seen them be successful in deals like that and been like, I wish I saw what they saw? 
[03:38:30]  No.  I'm always right.  Always.  Even when you're wrong, you're right.  Absolutely.  You've never.  But you don't sit there, you know, second guessing.  Or I don't know, second guessing.  But sitting there going, ah, I missed the boat on that one.  You know why?  You know why?  Because I know in two minutes something else is going to come through that door.  There's a million deals in the Naked City and the good ones are all going to come to Shark Tank.  I just have to sit there and wait for them to come to me.  Yeah, ABC is literally lying people up outside your door. 
[03:39:00]  Just like, hey.  They are getting thousands of applications for season five.  And every year the deals get better because people have figured out if they can just get their product on the show, sales go up a thousand percent.  Even if you don't invest.  Yeah, exactly.  If they can just get aired, it's like an eight-minute mega commercial.  And then, of course, it gets repeated.  People are blown away by the power.  You know, it's really the American Idol of venture capital.  That's what's happened to the show.  Who invested in I Want to Draw a Cat for You?  Oh, that was insane.  I think Mark was having a bad hair day and invested in that thing. 
[03:39:30]  I mean, that guy was funny, though.  And you know what the thing is?  I was watching it and thinking the same thing as you.  Like, this makes no sense.  What's he doing on the TV?  But every single episode of Shark Tank, I'm sitting there looking at the TV going, I want to draw a cat for you.  And it's like, maybe it works.  I think what Cuban saw in that guy was a creative guy he could throw into one of his other businesses.  But I don't know how many cats he's going to draw.  Like, let's face it.  Yeah.  That was very interesting.  But that's the thing about Shark Tank. 
[03:40:00]  You don't know what's coming down the pike.  And neither do I.  None of us see these things until they walk through the doors.  And sometimes I'm just blown away by how great the idea is or how stupid it is.  Cuban was in here a little while back.  And he was saying that, like, half the time, literally maybe half the time, these deals that you say yes on, you give to the back room.  And you start, you know, going through the paperwork and everything.  And you realize that these people, their numbers were wrong.  They got nervous on television.  And it completely falls through.  Yeah.  That happens. 
[03:40:30]  It's the real world of venture capital.  I mean, it's real money.  So each of us have a team.  I have a guy named Alex Kenji who runs a firm called O'Leary Ventures.  And we hire a ton of interns every summer just to work on all the Shark Tank deals.  And what you find out is people will come and say things that don't necessarily translate to being fact.  We also like to find out about the market they're in.  We do a lot of work.  And, you know, you think about the percentages in venture capital firms that close.  They're as low as 3%.  We're 10 times that.  So you're far better off coming on Shark Tank. 
[03:41:00]  And the probability of closing is extremely high compared to everybody else.  But, yes, due diligence happens, and it's part of the process.  When you're sitting in that room, how long are those pitches lasting?  Some of them, I think the record breaker is an hour and 20 minutes.  I mean, you want to talk about wasting your time.  No, but that's obviously a good deal.  Yeah.  You're really drilling.  We saw, you know, a really interesting franchise deal that I think lasted an hour and a half.  Did it make the air yet?  Not yet. 
[03:41:30]  And, you know, there's no guarantee these things are going to air, but that was a fascinating deal.  But now the editor's challenge is to turn that into a six-minute pitch.  Right.  An hour and a half.  It's not so easy.  Are you sitting there conscious of the fact that this is a television show, or are you thinking of your money first?  No, no.  I'm always thinking about my money.  You're thinking of the deal.  When you're an hour and a half into a deal, you've forgotten about the cameras.  Yeah.  Like, I mean, you know, I mean, the, the, what I learned the show was working when one day one of the cameramen came up to me and he said, I got to tell you something.  I shoot a lot of reality TV. 
[03:42:00]  This one, I'm actually watching as I'm shooting it.  You guys are drawing me into this thing.  And isn't it amazing how simple the concept is, but it's the one concept that actually, because it doesn't seem fake.  Every other reality show is fake.  Like, and, and it's not overly complicated and it's something.  No, it, it, it, either you believe in the idea or the person or you don't.  Right.  Or you're sitting on the fence deciding what question would I ask and does one of the sharks, are they going to ask that question?  I mean, I, I think what amazes me about what's happened to this thing and, and it sums it up this way. 
[03:42:30]  I was in San Francisco and a nine-year-old girl came up to me and said, look, I want to be on Shark Tank.  I said, and her mother was running up behind her saying, what's she doing with that old guy?  And, you know, and I, I said to her, look, why do you want to be on Shark Tank?  She said, I want to be free.  She had figured out at that age that the entrepreneurial spirit can sometimes result in wealth, which translates to freedom.  That's pretty cool.  Right.  And that, that is something that I think has triggered this family-oriented viewing that's occurring. 
[03:43:00]  It's so rare in America today.  What shows do you sit down with your kids with?  Nothing.  You can't.  Exactly.  So this is one that, that's happened and people are engaged.  Like, think about what's happened in America the last five years.  I think everybody's figured out this, that there's just, just as much risk working for  a big company and getting fired than there is starting your own.  At least if you fail in your own enterprise, it was by your own hand and you have more control  over your destiny. 
[03:43:30]  And if you're successful, you'll be rich.  There's nothing wrong with that.  That's what made this country great in the first place.  And I think that spirit's coming back after all that crap we've been through.  And you think that, that, that it is, that does having $4 billion give you a sense of  freedom that you just didn't have?  Yeah.  It's not about money.  I mean, all those people on Shark Tank, it's not about money anymore.  The beautiful place you want to find in your life is when you have enough money that you  can do whatever you like with your time.  Because the only thing that is finite for everybody is time.  Right.  And so I don't need more money. 
[03:44:00]  I need more time.  And I'm at the point in my life that I do things I want to do because I can afford to  be like that.  And, and I think that's where everybody should end up.  If they're successful as an entrepreneur, you, you toil and struggle for a decade on your  business, you're successful.  And then everybody tries retirement.  I tried that for three years.  Really boring.  Now I'm, now I love doing what I do.  This Shark Tank's fantastic.  It's, it's, it's a, it's a whole new genre of, of venture investing.  So are you still, but even though it's kind of this weird mix of business meets entertainment, 
[03:44:30]  do you feel competitive like you did when you were as active in business or is it more  like this is just a fun, whatever?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I want to go to bed richer than I woke up.  Still?  Every day.  I mean, look, that's never going to stop.  I like to win.  And I think the people on Shark Tank and the sharks and entrepreneurs are all in the same  boat.  But what I think is so interesting is that the platform Shark Tank can take a product 
[03:45:00]  that you've never heard of and put it on the national stage in one Friday night.  Of course I want to invest in those.  It's like getting millions of dollars of free advertising.  So I'm trying to pick and choose between the deals as to which ones I'm going to do that  are going to use the platform.  And this year I've got some doozies.  You're going to see some amazing stuff.  I love also the power that you have in that room.  I'm sitting there watching the guy open his bean bags and a bed comes out.  And I'm going, that's genius.  And then you go, nobody's going to pay money for foam in a canvas bag. 
[03:45:30]  And I'm like, yeah, nobody's going to pay money for that.  That's dumb.  It's so stupid.  Well, he may believe differently, but he's not getting my money.  I mean, it's, you know, you've got to think about really outside of the shining lights,  is it a product or service that is going to work?  I mean, that's basically why you're investing in it.  Does Mark Burnett, does he own a piece of whatever company goes through that show?  The syndicate does.  So the network owns a piece.  And so that's not uncommon.  That's called integration.  It makes sense. 
[03:46:00]  You're getting eight minutes of free advertising, and that's not free.  And, you know.  Yeah, I mean, and it's better than a commercial because it's the part of the show that people  are paying attention to.  Absolutely.  And, you know, frankly, I'm happy to have Disney as my partner in deals.  Nothing wrong with that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, totally.  This is Jesse May Peluso, just walked in.  Jesse May, this is Kevin O'Leary, a.k.a. Mr. Wonderful from Shark Tank.  Hey, Jesse.  That's so much to take in.  Whoa.  Well, yeah.  That's so much to take.  I don't know if Shark Tank involves sharks, because I just walk in.  He could be like a distributor of porn.  I'm not sure, like, what I want to do. 
[03:46:30]  Have you ever been in any adult business?  No, I think that it's a really high, great margin business, but it probably taints to my  other investments, so I've got to leave it alone.  That's what you've got to be conscious of.  When you have those diverse portfolios, it's...  Shut up, Sam.  Is this business going to affect my relationship with this company?  Exactly.  Did he just say taint?  Exactly.  Yeah.  I want to make sure.  I heard Disney, so obviously porn's out of the question.  No, it's out of the question there.  Do you...  How often are people now and then coming up to you with ideas for businesses?  Everywhere.  You know what I say, and this makes intuitive sense. 
[03:47:00]  Think about it.  Just on the way in this building, somebody was pitching me on something.  I said, look, if this is a great idea, go to the website, you know, sharktank.com.  Get on the show, because why would I invest in you here when you don't have the platform  of advertising I could get by putting you on Shark Tank?  I do my venture investing in Shark Tank because I get the free advertising.  That's why I do it.  Right, right.  So why would...  Everything...  I'm going to do Shark Tank deals now because I get to follow them every year on TV.  I can help the entrepreneur launch.  Um, it makes a lot more sense. 
[03:47:30]  What do you think about a comedian?  Like Jesse Maypolis.  Yeah, why don't you stick me in the Shark Tank?  No, you don't have any product to pitch yet.  It's my mouth.  You know, we...  Listen, we've had some comedians come on and try and sell a part of themselves.  What?  Like your body parts?  I could sort of own you.  Exactly.  I mean, 30, 40% of you.  Maybe that would work.  You should come on the Shark Tank.  I would do that.  Why not?  Do you just have to go up and tell jokes?  Well, they better be good.  Well, that's what I'm saying.  Then it's up to you, Mr. Wonderful, to be like, yeah, you're not funny.  So then it's objective.  Then it's like, you know, you have the... 
[03:48:00]  No, because the problem is, every comic, every comedian has a career.  There's an earnings life path.  And if you're successful, I get a piece of every dollar you make.  So you'd be basically my Shark Tank manager is what we're talking about.  Yes, exactly.  So basically you'd be like, every dude...  And that's what they tried to pitch on Shark Tank.  So far, no comic has made a deal yet.  That's a little hard.  Because I'm always worried that if you stepped outside and got run over by a truck,  you'd be road pizza and not any value at all.  Road pizza sounds delicious.  I've had that on the road, actually.  It's only funny once.  Exactly. 
[03:48:30]  You can only have...  What do you think?  Donald Trump.  Yes.  He said...  Obviously, you know, I watch Shark Tank every Friday.  Because how else would I know about all these products, right?  Yeah.  Donald Trump said, Friday night is Death Valley in television.  He's taking shots.  Now Celebrity Apprentice is back.  Right.  Donald Trump is taking some shots at your show.  What do you think of that statement?  Well, I've got bad news for Donald.  We need his show.  We have bigger numbers.  We have bigger ratings on a Friday than he has on his. 
[03:49:00]  You know, that's the thing about numbers.  You can't lie about them.  Right.  They're either black or white.  And the numbers tell you this.  Shark Tank rules.  Yeah.  The Shark Tank toilet flushes on Apprentice.  That's what happens.  That's what happens.  No, he didn't.  I'm just throwing it out there.  I'm just throwing it out there.  Yeah.  And, listen, Shark Tank is so successful on Fridays that they throw it on again on Wednesdays.  Totally.  You know?  That's right.  How do you like that, Donald Trump?  Hey, look.  If the numbers don't lie, the show is beating his show.  Now, I'm sure he can deal with it because he's had a lot of bad news in his life and  he knows how to deal with it.  Yeah.  I'm not worried about it. 
[03:49:30]  Who's had more bad news?  You or Donald Trump?  Oh, gee.  I bet we both had our dose.  We're both entrepreneurs and I respect him for that.  Yeah.  But don't call my show what it isn't.  It rules his.  It does.  Absolutely.  Oh, them are fighting words.  It's true.  I like that.  You're not in the television business.  You're just a competitive guy.  Do you get competitive over anything you're associated with?  Like, do you need to have the nicest suit in the room?  No.  He does.  I mean, look.  Roland is in second place with that oversized police t-shirt.  So, yes, you do have the nicest.  Roland in his pajamas right now. 
[03:50:00]  Look, I like to compete.  I'm a competitor.  Every entrepreneur wants to win.  I mean, the metric in our game is money, so that is important.  But it's also winning and helping young people become entrepreneurs.  I believe that once an entrepreneur has achieved success and bought freedom,  that's really what you get.  Right.  You owe the next generation what you know.  And more importantly, what your mistakes were.  You know, you want people to not make the same mistakes I made because that cost me money.  And I try and tell entrepreneurs all the time, particularly the ones I invest in,  and here's what you want to do, here's what you don't want to do. 
[03:50:30]  They don't always listen, but I come with a little gray hair and experience that matters.  How far low were you at one point?  Oh, almost bankrupt.  Really?  Yeah.  Wow.  In my first large deal, the learning company, we were $500 million in debt,  and we were just 60 days away from having to pay all that back.  And we figured it out.  We had a huge hit in Rita Rabbit, and it just saved our hineys.  And what are you worth today?  I never give my net worth out. 
[03:51:00]  You know, people try to figure.  There's a website.  What's Kevin O'Leary worth?  I got it.  That's the name of the website?  Yeah, and there's another one called IHateKevinO'Leary.com.  You can register there, too.  You like that, though, because it's getting your name out there.  I love it.  I love it.  But, I mean, it says in the opening credits of Shark Tank that you made, like, $4.2 billion  when you sold your software company.  So I'm assuming it's a lot.  What are you doing for lunch?  You know, in the end, I don't need more money.  I need more time.  That's what I tell people.  There comes a point when you get to take that money and reinvest it, including in charities. 
[03:51:30]  I support a lot of stuff.  And these days, I'm trying to be an artist, too.  You know, I'm a starving artist.  Hold the starving.  Right.  I mean, well, you know, you used to talk about artists and time that you need.  Yeah.  E-Rock, who's launching his four-podcast podcast network, is also writing a movie where the  main character gets to go back in time and travel through the decades.  Well, maybe that works.  But on the podcast deal, if I could short that stock, I would.  So you're still not investing, even with the movie.  I could make money in his failure.  I'd still do that.  What if I throw the movie in? 
[03:52:00]  I told you the premise, a guy gets to go back in time and travel through the decades,  meet the love of his life.  You get that movie and the podcast.  Do you want to invest in Eric Nagel?  I have invested in movies.  It is the crappiest investment on the planet Earth.  You never make any money in a movie.  E-Rock, I'm sorry.  Just tell you the truth.  He passed.  He wants you to get lit on fire.  Well, thanks for talking to me today.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Somebody has a question, actually.  Chris in New Hampshire wants to talk to Kevin O'Leary from Shark Tank, which is on Fridays  on ABC. 
[03:52:30]  What's up, Chris?  Hey, big fan, Kevin.  I really enjoy the show.  I watch it every week.  I wanted to ask you, though, before you even took on this project, did you watch any of  the BBC Dragons' Den?  And if so, I really like Shark Tank in the sense that it's way more edgy than what the  Brits were doing.  Yes, I did.  In fact, I studied those CDs when the producer sent them over to see what worked and what  didn't.  We're different than the British show because we spend a lot more time finding about the 
[03:53:00]  past of the individuals before they come into the tank.  You understand their challenges, what their successes and failures have been before.  You know more about them than what you see on the British show.  And somehow that's made Shark Tank a little different.  Plus, in America here, we have 10 sectors to our economy.  We have everything here.  So there's much more diversity.  You have a lot less of that in England.  If you could take one person out of the Shark Tank, one of those sharks that you're just  like, what are you doing here?  Which shark would you give the boot to?  I wouldn't change anything about the cast because it's working. 
[03:53:30]  It is.  That's what I've learned.  You know how hard it is to get a hit on television?  Nobody gets a hit.  I mean, obviously I don't.  I don't have a hit on television.  You don't touch it when it's working.  And it's working.  Everything, every one of those sharks has something they bring to that, to just the  soup that makes it successful.  That's what I've learned.  You don't mess with it.  How come the ladies switch episodes?  You know, the interesting story is that Laurie was actually going to be, from the first  season, a sharkette, as I call them.  And unfortunately, her dad died right at the beginning of shooting. 
[03:54:00]  She had to go back, obviously.  And then Barbara filled in.  But everybody was always thinking about her.  So they kind of swapped the seat.  And it works, because she's the queen of QVC.  She's an expert on product-based deals and knows how to make money selling them off the  leverage of Shark Tank.  Some of the stuff she does, I don't agree with.  I mean, she's done some.  And I've actually done some deals with her.  This year, I just did a deal with her.  So, you know, you never know.  With Laurie and with Barbara, Barbara's crazy.  They're both nuts.  That's what I like. 
[03:54:30]  I like when you tell other people their business.  I like when you tell Laurie, that's not going to work on QVC.  And she's like, you don't know.  What do you know about QVC?  And you're like, don't worry.  I'm always right.  Yeah.  Well, we established that earlier.  Exactly.  What's been your biggest thing this year?  I guess, don't spoil anything.  My biggest thing, you haven't seen yet.  And it is the first one that I think we've ever had on the show that's global.  A business that works in every country on Earth, right here from America.  It is really cool.  And it is a very interesting deal. 
[03:55:00]  I'm dying for that thing to air.  It's going to knock your socks off.  And yes, it works on your phone.  What?  Yeah.  It's a very amazing.  You know, when I saw that, the first 10 seconds when he was pitching, I thought, why didn't  I think of that?  It's fucking brilliant.  And then you were like, I don't have to think of that.  I can buy that.  Yes.  I have to pay a lot of money for it.  But the kids, they got it right.  They just, that was a genius idea.  And you'll see it.  There hasn't been one product that you've sat there and been like, I should have invested  in it.  Never, never.  I never, never, never cry over spilled milk. 
[03:55:30]  You know why?  There's a million deals in the Naked City.  They'll come right through the door next.  They'll find something else.  I don't worry about it if I don't invest in it.  He's intense.  This guy's intense.  I like how he censored himself, too.  Well, he didn't really censor himself.  He just said it quietly.  Which is fine.  That's how my mom swears.  I got emotional about that deal.  I like it.  Jimmy in Boston.  Hey, Kevin.  Big fan.  Big fan of the show and all you guys on there.  Sam, I think, I'm almost 100% sure your sponsor went through the Shark Tank.  Was Dollar Shave Club on Shark Tank? 
[03:56:00]  Do you know about Dollar Shave Club?  I've heard of it.  That was definitely not on Shark Tank.  I got to tell you about Dollar Shave Club.  Everybody forgets to buy razor blades, right?  Right.  All the time.  And he's sitting there looking at me like, I'm not doing a free commercial for you.  I'm too smart for that.  Let me do all the talking.  Dollar Shave Club.  You know, you end up, you're looking at your face in the mirror.  You got no razor blades because you forgot to buy them.  Or even a billionaire is going to sit there and be like, it's too expensive.  But it's cool not to shave now.  It's a style. 
[03:56:30]  Yeah, but look at you.  Well, look at you.  You're both clean shaved.  Well, I got a little stubble.  But everybody's got a little stubble going on now.  A little bit.  But women, I don't want to be chafed all over my body.  Yeah, but you know what?  I don't want there to be war wounds.  In business, you can't have.  No, no.  You got to be clean shaved.  You don't want to face your hair when you're pitching for money.  And you don't want to waste money if you're in business, right?  So what's the answer?  Dollar Shave Club is the answer.  Let me tell you about this, Kevin.  I can't wait.  It's amazing.  What they've done is they take out all the vibrating handles.  They take out all the 10 blades on one razor blade that never do anything you don't need. 
[03:57:00]  They take all that out.  This is old school.  Yes.  And they send you in the mail.  You send them a couple bucks a month.  It's nothing.  And they send you every single month quality razor blades so that you don't run out because they keep replenishing.  And you save all that money because that's never going to work.  Oh, it works.  It's never going to work.  Oh, it works.  Trust me.  I know.  Are you part...  Is this a real thing?  It's a real thing.  It's dollarshaveclub.com.  You're using old blades like the old classic or these plastic things coming in the mail. 
[03:57:30]  They're metal blades.  Yeah, yeah.  And they're high quality metal blades.  And they have...  They don't...  I mean, you know...  Do you have a handle?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You get...  No, no, no.  They send you a nice high quality handle.  It just doesn't vibrate because you don't need it to vibrate.  Here's why that deal isn't going to work.  The cost of acquiring the customer is more than lifetime value.  That's...  I guarantee you why it's going to zero.  You know what?  I disagree, Kevin.  And I would invest in it.  But I don't have to because they're already a successful company.  Dollarshaveclub.com. 
[03:58:00]  Dollarshaveclub.com.  It sounds like you own a piece of it.  Dollarshaveclub.com.  It sounds like he starts...  I think he runs it out of his basement.  Oh, yeah.  I like that.  You guys should team up with the suicide prevention program as well.  He's trying to get his customer acquisition costs down by just repeating that website over  and over.  Yeah, right.  Dollarshaveclub.com.  That's it, Jesse May.  And listen, unless I own half of it, I don't even remember its name.  Listen.  Oh, I like this guy.  We don't have any more time.  But Shark Tank, which I don't own half of, but I'm happy to promote, is on Fridays at 
[03:58:30]  8 p.m. on ABC.  Yes.  So check it out.  And you can see Kevin ask people to light themselves on fire sometimes.  Hey, I'm just trying to help.  Yeah.  Thank you very much, Mr. Wonderful, for stopping by.  Thank you.  Ron and Fez are up next.  Goodbye, everybody.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye. </pre>
