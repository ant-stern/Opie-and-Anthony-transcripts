<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, transitioning rapidly between serious news discussions and crude, often sexually explicit humor.  The show opened with a discussion of a plane crash in Buffalo, attributed to pilot error, with the hosts speculating on the pilot's possible motivations in a humorous, albeit insensitive, manner. A pilot even called in to offer his perspective, though the conversation quickly strayed. This was followed by a significantly more graphic and detailed discussion of the murder of New York newsman George Weber by a 16-year-old.  The hosts analyzed the crime in explicit detail, focusing on the victim and killer's sexual proclivities, drawing heavily from news reports and the killer's MySpace page.  Their commentary included explicit descriptions of sexual acts and preferences, and they openly criticized the media's portrayal of the victim and his alleged sexual behavior.

The show then shifted gears to discuss upcoming guests: Judah Friedlander, Patrice O'Neill, Anvil, and Bill Burr (scheduled for the entire following week).  A review of Anvil's documentary was briefly mentioned. The hosts also commented on a local news channel's format change, comparing it to a variety show, and made crude remarks about Valerie Bertinelli's appearance in a bikini, alongside reminiscing about old television shows with offensive language.

The next segment began with humorous commentary on a former traffic reporter's bizarre new career path, including a "smelliest sneaker" contest, and continued with jokes about one host's workout routine, specifically focusing on the protection of his genitals while wearing sweatpants without underwear.  A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to a discussion about the potential replacement of the US dollar as the world's reserve currency, referencing Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner's comments and contrasting them with a previous guest's, Jimmy's, perspective.  The hosts debated the economic implications and likelihood of such a shift, drawing parallels to the Euro's creation.

The economic situation in Mexico, Hillary Clinton's handling of cartel violence, and a significant fare hike for the New York City MTA subway system were also discussed.  The hosts expressed outrage over the MTA fare hike, contrasting it with what they perceived as the actions of French workers protesting working conditions.  The segment ended with further discussion of the MTA fare hike and a promise to address a story about French business protests in a future segment.

[00:06:30]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony. 
[00:07:00]  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to say, I refuse to say, I refuse to say, I refuse to say, I refuse to say, I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw.  Go screw.  I'll be right back.  Go screw.  Go screw.  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  What would I sacrifice in a chimp attack so the family gets 50 mil? 
[00:07:30]  50 mil for a chimp attack.  50 million?  I'd put on a chimp outfit and bite my mother's face off.  I was lucky enough to be in Istanbul.  It's 90-something percent Muslim, but it was the good kind.  I mean, every once in a while you would see one and they would point out that's a radical Muslim. 
[00:08:00]  They were pretty regular holding a head in his hand.  This is what's left of a Pennsylvania dog kennel after a propane tank ignited, setting the pens on fire.  The Opie and Anthony radio show, the most popular show in the history of satellite radio.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Oh, you got that right, Jay.  Thank you so much.  Calling Jay's comments palaver?  It's not palaver. 
[00:08:30]  It's the truth, ladies and gentlemen.  Absolutely.  The most popular show in satellite radio history.  The history, yes.  That's right, right here.  And getting bigger every day.  Of the satellite.  Wow, we got two updates on two big stories.  Pilot error.  Pilot error.  Yep.  Everyone was going with icing on the wing.  Talking about that crash in Buffalo.  Yeah.  That crash into that house. 
[00:09:00]  Killing one dude in the house.  That's got to be the worst.  Yeah, that's unlucky lottery.  Because that's the safest place in the whole world, your bed.  Yeah.  You got a figure.  You're in bed all warm, nice, with the one you love or by yourself, whatever.  Yeah.  Whatever you're into.  Or some 16-year-old killer.  Whatever.  Yeah.  You still feel like it's the safest place on earth, right?  Right.  It feels like a nest.  Like, nothing could go wrong in this spot.  The safety of your house. 
[00:09:30]  Boy, not for that dude in Buffalo.  The last thing you expect is a giant nose cone and propellers to just hack through your roof  and hit you.  To give you the worst headache ever for a split second and then death.  Donnie Darko.  You know, an engine falls on you.  So he was in bed when it happened?  He was sleeping?  I assume.  I punched it up a little bit.  Maybe not.  That would suck.  Maybe he was walking around looking at kiddie porn on the internet.  I don't know.  Maybe he was a creep. 
[00:10:00]  One of the two.  Right.  Who knows?  Or maybe the real irony.  He was trying to get his kid to eat.  He was doing the airplane thing.  Come on.  Eat the potato.  Here comes the airplane into the hangar.  Whoops.  That would make it really creepy because I think the kid was like 15 or 16.  But maybe he was with a radio disc jockey.  Well, we're going to get to the second update in a second.  Oh, boy.  That story's sexy.  Smothered for what?  Oh, boy.  Really fast, though. 
[00:10:30]  Pilot R.  I don't know shit about flying, but God damn, does Ant?  No.  He knows the whole damn story.  I do my little studying.  Yeah, but basically, the guy, what, pulled up on the stick?  Yeah.  And it was pilot error.  It wasn't icing that caused that horrific plane crash in Buffalo.  Yeah.  The icing was like a peripheral issue because the plane started to feel a little shaky.  That's what happens before a plane stalls.  The wing stalls.  It goes a little shake a little bit.  Yeah.  And he pulled back on the stick, which is a no-no. 
[00:11:00]  That makes sense.  It's a no-no.  But it makes sense.  You're stalling.  Yeah.  Pull back on the stick.  That's what I would do.  It's kind of an instinctive thing where you figure you want to stay in the air, so you  want to go up.  So you would pull back on the stick when the thing you're really supposed to do is put  your nose down.  Yeah.  So you get your speed back up.  Yeah.  This guy pulled up.  Oops.  There goes the wing stall, and you pretty much wing over.  But you'd do anything if you know you're not going to be in the air. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm surprised he didn't start flapping his wings like, oh.  Probably did.  Or pedaling his feet.  Right.  Like, I'll pedal my feet.  Yeah.  Try to stay in the air.  So that's a no-no?  Oh, so if the plane looks like it's going to stall, you're supposed to do the opposite  of what this guy was doing?  Yeah.  It has to do with altitude, too.  If you're stalling out close to the ground but not close enough to land, you're screwed.  Yeah.  But if you've got a little altitude, yeah, you're supposed to nose down, get the speed  back up, and then airspeed takes care of stalls for the most part. 
[00:12:00]  Unless you get a lot of ice on the wings, but apparently they're saying they didn't have  that much ice on there.  No, they're calling the ice factor minimal impact on how the plane performed.  Yeah.  So basically meaning that the plane should have kept flying nice.  Was that the one with the chick pilot, or was that the guy pilot?  I think it was the chick pilot.  Oh, Jesus.  Sorry to the chicks out there, but this one doesn't look good for you guys.  And I got to say, you always, when you look in that cockpit there, you like kind of,  ah, ah, you like seeing Sully. 
[00:12:30]  You like seeing a guy that looks like Sully in there.  Not necessarily, man.  Those guys are drunks.  I'd rather have a drunk guy.  I see him in the bar, like, sharing pitchers of beer.  Yeah.  I'm like, all right, what, you're going to drive home now, or are you flying a plane?  It's either or.  They are just coming back from a flight, and we're maybe going, driving home, yeah.  That's what I mean, though.  They're all drunk.  I mean, if they're around a table, like, sharing pitchers of beer, there's two options.  Yeah.  They're going home to their loved ones in a car, or they're getting back in a plane and 
[00:13:00]  flying somewhere.  Yeah.  I know they used to say, 12 hours, bottle to throttle.  Yeah.  And that doesn't seem like enough time.  Hell no.  I've still been shit-faced after 12 hours.  Yeah.  So, whatever.  Pilot era.  You look up there.  You just want to see a seasoned gentleman, some gray hair, perhaps, tucking out from under  that professional hat, that nicely pressed pilot suit. 
[00:13:30]  That's what you want to see.  I don't want to see a chick going like, you know, oh, here she is.  She wants to play pilot.  You describe something you never see, though.  Hmm?  The suit's a little, like, wrinkled.  The hair's a little askew.  I don't know.  You know something?  The hat is on just slightly off-center.  Maybe on those little commuter flights.  Yeah.  But when you take, like, a nice airline, and you see the pilots getting on, I feel 
[00:14:00]  I looked one day, because I was kind of standing right behind the pilot at one point, and he  just got, like, a haircut.  It was perfectly coiffed.  His suit was, like, it had a nice seam on the sleeve and everything.  That's wonderful.  That was covering up his alcoholism.  Well, or something else, you know?  He's probably an obsessive-compulsive jerk ironing his shirt, so he's up all night.  His eyes are bloodshot.  Yeah.  I can't get the crease straight. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, he had 10 minutes sleep, because he had to get his uniform just right.  And his haircut.  Right.  You're crazy, man.  He probably hates touching clouds with the plane, so he has to, like, fly up and dip  and left.  Clouds are dirty.  Yes.  Stay away from the dirty clouds.  Dirty clouds.  You're weaving all over the sky, because this idiot can't touch a cloud.  That would be insane.  Imagine he's the best pilot ever, but he can't touch clouds.  But he can't touch the cloud.  That's the only problem.  Oh, jeez.  So he passes his destination by 100, 200 miles. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, yeah.  Until he gets blue skies, so that he can duck under the clouds and turn back around.  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to be, it looks about now like about an hour and 20  minutes.  Could be two hours late.  It seems to be a very filthy, puffy thing in front of the plane.  We're going to have to avoid that at all costs.  Believe me.  I won't be able to fly through this thing.  It's filthy.  The plane was just washed.  Like, my hair just got to cut. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  I love that concept.  What can we do with that concept?  A pilot that can't touch clouds.  Can't touch clouds.  You're in the sky.  And everyone just looks the other way, you know?  Yeah.  You know, all right, he's got his fault, but he's a great pilot.  And it's the pilot's final word, whether they go or not.  Like, they can look at the weather reports and everything like that, but it's pretty  much the pilot's word and his decision whether to go.  Right.  I can see him with his hands on his hips. 
[00:16:00]  Nice, bright, sunny day.  Looking up, but there's one cloud up there.  And he goes, nope.  Call it off.  People are waiting there.  What happened?  Just obsessed with clouds.  What happened?  There's floating shit in the sky.  That's what happened.  Well, he takes off and he flies at 100 feet for like 70 miles and like, what are we doing?  And it's like, he just doesn't like the clouds.  100 feet.  This lunatic doesn't like that cloud.  He's going to jam on the brakes any second.  The plane's really good.  No, he's good.  Don't worry about it. 
[00:16:30]  I've been on his plane numerous times.  It's just a nightmare.  We'll get there eventually when he figures out his problems.  The bottom of the plane's all green from scraping treetops.  Right.  It's just a weirdo.  Right.  But never crashes.  No, no.  He's really good.  He just doesn't like dirty clouds.  Whenever he banks left, he has to bank right too.  He has to bank both ways.  Banks one way once.  He's got to bank the other way twice.  Tick.  Left.  Tick, tick.  Tick, tick.  Wait, he has to go right.  Oh, what a creep he would be. 
[00:17:00]  The OCD pilot.  How about he has to just obsessively drop from the sky a few thousand feet?  Yeah.  Just because it feels right.  Thank you for flying with us, ladies and gentlemen.  Thank you for flying with us, ladies and gentlemen.  Thank you for flying with us, ladies and gentlemen.  Up a thousand, down 500.  Up a thousand, down 500.  I'm getting word the pilot wasn't a girl.  Wow.  But then someone says a woman had more airtime in that type of plane than the man did.  All righty.  And then we got a pilot's perspective.  We got a pilot's perspective, Anthony. 
[00:17:30]  Ooh, I like Bob.  What's up, Bob?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  What do you fly, my friend?  How I fly the airplane that was involved in the accident.  Oh.  You don't mind clouds, do you?  No, I don't mind clouds.  You know, guys, after five years of listening, I finally figured you'd hit a topic.  It finally got me going.  Because you get all these calls in the morning, you know, guys calling you in saying,  hey, man, you know, this isn't cool what you guys are talking about.  Right.  Yeah, look at that.  Yeah, I know.  You finally hit one that hit close to home.  But, hey, guys, you know, for the most part, we do the best job we can. 
[00:18:00]  And, you know, the training is top-notch.  The plane's top-notch.  You know, I know you guys got a good topic to go on this morning.  But, you know, hey, if you ever look at saw we got paid and saw what we have to go through  on a day-to-day basis to do what we do, I think you'd have a different perspective on it.  Well, you know what it is?  You're a pilot, right?  Yeah.  It's like I was reading a book.  The book was called Pilots are Bums.  I'm just kidding.  We like pilots, dude.  How do you think we'd get anywhere? 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, right?  We probably fly more than most people.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not more than me.  True.  I was just thinking I got four flights in the next, God, two months, I think.  Really?  Yeah.  Which would be eight.  Back and forth.  Four back and forths.  No, we definitely know what goes into it and everything like that.  And it is pretty amazing.  When you think about it, it is an amazing thing. 
[00:19:00]  You're flying.  Yeah.  But, you know, occasionally when these things happen, you kind of go like, when you hear  pilot error, you're like, what the hell happened?  You know?  God, there was a breakdown in something.  Bob, we're two minutes into your phone call and you still haven't given us the perspective  part.  That you called in about.  You ever ice up a little bit?  You ever almost stall?  No.  You got to stall in training, though.  Yeah, you do stall in training. 
[00:19:30]  You know, but a lot of it, it's the FAA guidelines that they train us to.  Yeah.  It definitely doesn't address what happened up there in Buffalo.  Bob is proof that flying is extremely safe.  He has nothing.  He's just thinking about flying.  He has absolutely nothing.  He's just thinking about flying.  Leave Bob.  Bob, what about the fear pilots have?  The clouds are really made of solid lid.  And then they have to avoid them. 
[00:20:00]  Well, as long as you avoid the clouds that are hiding the mountains, you're generally okay.  Hiding the mountains.  Very good.  Yeah.  All right, Bob.  Thank you so much.  We look forward to having a phone call.  One question from Bob.  It's great anticipation.  Bob, Bob, Bob.  There goes Bob.  He left?  That's perfect.  No, he's still there.  What would happen if you were flying?  Is there any way would the plane crash?  If you were flying, and like say you hit turbulence and you dipped down left, and the plane rolled  actually over, like actually rolled, like where the ceiling was on the ground, like... 
[00:20:30]  A barrel roll.  There you go.  A barrel roll.  What would...  Is it survivable?  It depends on how much altitude you had, you know, and how much training you had.  You know, we had a little aerobatic experience, but, you know, for the most part, you know,  we had that experience, you know.  You ever see that video of the 707 doing a barrel roll?  No.  That's awesome, isn't it?  And how much altitude that fucking thing loses when he does it?  There's something about a 707 being sideways where it really is...  It drops like a motherfucker. 
[00:21:00]  It was a demonstration that this guy was doing, and it's actually his son did a whole  little blog on it or something, and they posted the video, and it's a 707.  This guy was just kind of testing it out for Boeing, and did a barrel roll.  Wow.  A 707, what's that?  How old is it?  Four engines.  It's an old plane.  It was replaced by like the 747, pretty much, back in the 60s, early 70s.  It was huge.  I mean, every plane movie you saw in the 60s was a 707. 
[00:21:30]  Okay.  Yeah, and to do a barrel roll in one of those fucking things is insane.  But you could see how this thing dropped like a rock once the wings started really coming  up, and it got like no lift, because it doesn't have that speed like a fighter plane to just  keep it going.  So the momentum will do it.  Yeah.  The best part of that YouTube video is the comments from the pilot.  You could tell he got schooled a little bit by Boeing.  You know, like, hey, that was great, but don't do that again. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, how about you don't ever do that again?  Oh, really?  It wasn't sanctioned?  No.  No, back then, they were a little more of a hot dog, a little more hot dog-ish than they  are now.  And he obviously didn't have passengers or anything like that.  No, no, no.  Obviously, right.  What was he, just flying the plane back to somewhere and just decided to do it?  I think he was doing like a, I think he was at like a test pilot or something.  I'm not sure of the exact circumstance.  I just was awed by the fact that this guy was able to pull off a barrel roll with a 707. 
[00:22:30]  I got a little puke in my mouth because we'll get into it a little later.  They're remaking the Three Stooges.  Are you insane?  I think this has to be a rumor.  Thank you, sir.  Thanks, Bab.  It is on every entertainment site.  I've known this for a while.  I know someone who knows Sean, he's playing Larry Fine, and they think that Del Toro  I knew it was Larry Fine.  Yeah, they're going to play, he's going to play.  And Jim Carrey.  And Del Toro's got to play Moe.  And Jim Carrey's in there.  Carrey is the one that I didn't hear.  That's the new addition.  Jim Carrey.  Shemp.  Oh, my God.  Or Curly. 
[00:23:00]  He's going to put on 40 pounds.  He's got to play Curly, yeah.  Benicio playing Moe.  Yeah, it might make sense.  He's got a wacky accent still.  Dude, you could.  A little bit.  But you could put the Three Stooges on Sunday.  That's a good day for the Three Stooges, right?  Saturday or Sunday morning.  And what are they going to do?  Put boing, boing, boing, boing.  It's a movie about them, I think, though.  And the show is a movie on the...  About them.  About them.  I think it's...  That's better.  Okay, that's not better.  All right, now it makes sense.  That's not the remake of the show. 
[00:23:30]  Meaning what?  They're going to get into their personalities and what they were as people?  Yeah, I'm thinking...  How they were as people or whatever?  Okay, that's better.  Yeah.  All right, now I'm not as scared.  I'm like, are they going to start making Three Stooges movies?  I'm Larry Fine, and I want to plunk you in the eyes with two fingers.  All right, well, maybe we should...  What do you know on the Three Stooges, Travis?  Well, I know it's not a biopic.  It's not?  No.  It's a movie.  So they're going to be making Three Stooges movies, basically. 
[00:24:00]  As those guys are going to be acting as the Stooges, but it's not a biopic.  I want to see a biopic.  I don't want to see them make a movie where they're going, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo.  No, no, no.  I don't think they would do that.  I couldn't picture Sean Penn signing on to do a remake of the Three Stooges like that.  Sean Penn will play Larry.  Yeah.  Yeah, we know all that.  Oh, okay.  But we're trying to figure out what the movie's going to be.  No, apparently the Farrelly brothers wrote this like 10 years ago, and they've just been  trying to get it made.  How do you know it's not a biopic? 
[00:24:30]  Because it says, the film is not a biopic.  Okay.  So what is it?  Not a lot of room for interpretation.  Yeah.  It is a comedy built around the antics of the three characters that Moe Howard, Larry  Fine, and Howard played in the Columbia Pictures shorts.  So they will be going woo, woo, woo and doing that.  I didn't know that.  That.  I thought it was a biopic.  You sure it isn't a biopic?  Well, it says here, this film is not a biopic.  Ah, okay.  Well, that might. 
[00:25:00]  Prove it in a second article.  Yeah.  Give us.  I want a second opinion sentence.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Exactly.  All of a sudden, that's the law.  What is that shit you're reading?  Yeah.  This is from Variety.  Oh, what do they know about Hollywood?  Not much.  Not much, really.  The show has none of that on it.  All right.  Thank you.  This is Sean Penn's first comedy since 1989.  Great.  Which was?  I'm going to wait, hold a guess.  It was something like the Priest movie with De Niro.  Something like We're No Angels? 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  Exactly.  That was a comedy?  Yeah.  I didn't see it.  I never saw it.  It was a guess.  All right.  Thank you, Travis.  I thought Bad Boys.  Bad Boys.  It's funny.  That movie rocked.  When Tweety gets killed.  No kidding.  Do comedies.  Oh, wow.  De Niro.  Yeah.  It's like he's in the room.  Yeah.  God, it's three stooges.  What are you doing?  That's silly.  What are you doing?  Those movies are still solid.  Yeah.  George Weber's killer was caught. 
[00:26:00]  For the people outside New York, George Weber was a news guy, I guess.  I don't know if I ever heard his voice.  I guess I must have heard his voice.  On ABC, I guess, here in New York.  Yeah.  He broadcasts with a ball gag in his mouth.  It's always difficult.  What a cheeky boy he was.  He comes in in the gimp suit in the morning.  Naughty, naughty.  One of George Weber's friends called us degenerates.  Yeah.  Just want to put that out there, by the way.  I mean, it sucks what happened. 
[00:26:30]  It's horrific and horrible what happened to George Weber.  I don't know if I'm in the news.  I don't want to tell you, motherfucker.  But George Weber.  Yeah, a sexy story now.  He found a mandate.  They called it a mandate from Craigslist.  He wanted some rough sex.  Rough sex.  The guy was into the rough sex.  And he got his rough sex.  He certainly did.  And a beating and a death.  And we have a MySpace.  Huh?  And we got a MySpace from this kid. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, it turns out it's a 16-year-old lunatic that loved knives.  Loves the knives.  There's lots of pictures of him holding various knives, swords, things like that.  And he's in custody.  They caught him upstate, I guess.  Yeah.  To the potential killers out there.  We want to help you out.  Yes.  If you're going to flee, you don't flee to anyone you know.  Yeah.  That's where they're looking.  You dummies.  Yeah, they're going to get you.  He assumed he could just hang out at his friend's house in upstate New York. 
[00:27:30]  Why not?  In Middleton or somewhere.  It's far away.  Right.  So they got him.  And it turns out he's confessed.  He said that George Weber gave him 60 bucks to basically smother and have sex with him.  And then he said he blacked out.  He doesn't remember the stabbing.  Of course, that's convenient.  Right.  But boy, this guy was a dirty, dirty boy.  He liked the rough sex.  The 16-year-old boy.  Big sub.  Yeah. 
[00:28:00]  Craigslist is getting a bad rap again.  They can't stop talking about Craigslist.  So what?  People have been doing this for years.  They meet in bars.  This is just easier.  What the fuck?  Why don't they talk about all the non-violent sexual experiences people have on Craigslist?  All right.  Why don't you do that, Jim?  There's a lot of them.  Or talk about the nice couch you bought.  You know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, the paper had to do an article.  Well, no one has learned their lesson.  These were some of the postings on Craigslist just last night.  Oh, they show that?  Oh, yeah.  So if you want to be stabbed, please call this number. 
[00:28:30]  We'll only kill you at your house.  One post.  Out call only.  Out call only.  One post was asking for light.  What did he write?  Light abuse.  Light abuse, I said.  Was it light abuse?  Oh.  What is that?  Just like spanking and maybe a little degrading.  Call you an idiot?  I suppose.  Light abuse, probably spanking, nipple, little nipple playing.  How?  Oh, I don't like that.  Nipple torture.  I hate the nipple thing. 
[00:29:00]  Leave them alone.  Stop.  I love my nipples play with.  I know you do, Jimmy.  On a guy, they're just there.  They're there for silly reasons.  On a girl, they're there for, you know, the babies are supposed to feed on them, but we  find them fantastic.  Yeah.  But on a guy, it's just like, why are they there?  My girlfriend likes my nipples.  She likes playing with my nipples.  And so when I'm banging her, she'll be on her back, and then she'll have her arms kind  of propped up like that, and I just kind of, as I'm fucking her, I'm brushing my nipples  against the backs of her hands.  She doesn't have to do anything.  She likes that, though.  It's really convenient.  She's just kind of sitting like she's getting her nails done. 
[00:29:30]  I'm pushing my nipples against her hands.  And then you go, what do you sound like when you come?  With the woman's noise?  Yes.  I really did.  I made woman's noises when I came.  A couple times with her.  That means you're really into this woman there, Jimmy.  Yeah.  I kind of have a collapsing.  Oh, no.  Who said that?  A woman.  What's that?  Yes, exactly.  A friend with breasts and an extra gift. 
[00:30:00]  You called the extra gift?  Yes.  She, like when I pull out, on rare occasions where I decide to pull out, but when I come,  it's like I always just collapse forward on my hands.  It really is.  It's fucking horrendous.  You can't just completely collapse your weight on the girl.  So you try the one elbow thing and I have no strength left.  Like a newborn fawn.  Yeah.  It's amazing how much power is in that stuff.  Once it leaves your body, you're just done. 
[00:30:30]  Well, you've got to get rid of the poison.  Yes.  She has a dild and a little dildo.  Uh-oh.  Did that find a special place?  Not in me.  Oh, okay.  No.  I was getting a rod.  I just stopped breathing.  No, no, no, no.  Really?  Don't talk.  Don't make it sound like it's out of the realm of possibility, Jimmy.  I didn't say that.  I didn't say that.  What a great belt to go with it. 
[00:31:00]  She has a...  It's brand new.  It still smells like rubber.  Ah.  Good.  She took it out and it was rather large.  I was like, ugh.  I was kind of turned on that she likes that.  Ah.  But it wasn't as big as I thought, which was good.  Yeah?  Yeah, I did a little comparison when I was behind her.  I didn't let her see it.  Oh, did you kind of?  Yeah.  Well, let me see if this is...  It's thicker than my dick and it's got me by like an inch.  Yeah.  It was nothing that you'd be ashamed of.  Like, you know, it's fake. 
[00:31:30]  It's supposed to be.  It's a porn star dick.  So it's like, all right.  Hey, sometimes the boxer with the shorter reach wins.  You know, it happens.  Yeah, it's true.  The tell of the tape, you know, it's not always who's going to win.  Yeah, but when both have arms of equal...  When the longer reach also has a thicker arm.  Nice big fat fist.  Yeah.  Tell the fucking guys that fought Foreman.  Tell the Joe Frazier.  Down goes Frazier.  That Foreman was a bad mother-effer.  Shut your mouth.  Just talk about George Foreman.  He got a bum deal. 
[00:32:00]  He should have been the greatest boxer of all time, that George Foreman.  Yeah, what a bum deal he got making trillions off of that stupid grill.  Yeah, but he wants to be known for the boxer he was.  Well, he is.  He was undefeated.  And his son's George, George, George.  All right, we get it.  You're a retard.  He retired too early, and I don't know.  He had the potential to be the greatest of all time.  He became a reverend.  He was an animal.  A preacher or whatever.  And after the Ali defeat, and he lost, he was like 60-5 or something.  He had an amazing record. 
[00:32:30]  And he thinks that that fight in Zaire with Ali, Foreman kind of thinks that the ropes,  if you read his biography.  They loosened him up a little bit.  He feels they were loosened up so Ali could go farther back and kind of in the cradle of  the ropes.  Right.  Foreman had suspicions about that fight all along.  His biography is called By George.  I read it years ago.  By George.  Yeah, but that was the first rope-a-dope that Ali did, right?  Well, maybe they didn't know he was going to rope-a-dope, but just in general.  I'm just thinking if you're a boxer and your opponent's trying something so weird and different, 
[00:33:00]  you can't figure it out.  Maybe that's why Ali rope-a-dopes.  Maybe he felt the ropes were giving.  I mean, again, so.  Or maybe you tried.  Yeah, okay.  It's amazing they called it that, like, not knowing what was going to happen to Ali years  later because of that strategy.  They say he's all there, though.  He just didn't communicate it.  They say he's completely there.  And that's what his nightmare is.  He just can't communicate what he's thinking.  Yeah, his motor skills.  Right.  That's great.  Oh, yeah, you just saw when we were kings.  Unlike our own E-Rock. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, then it would be called rape-a-dope.  Speaking of rape-a-dope, so George Weber.  Here's the ladies.  They got the 16-year-old creep who, of course, neighbors are saying was a loner.  Kind of a loner?  Yeah.  Yeah, they left him alone.  They were scared of this kid.  Yeah.  And his MySpace pictures were looking at him.  I thought these were sort of photoshopped in the paper, but a lot of pictures of the kid  with knives.  He likes, uh...  I like knives.  He loves knives.  Here's what we got. 
[00:34:00]  Why'd you do it?  Go ahead and gawk.  Look, it's not every day you get a glimpse of a self-styled, devil-worshipping, sadomasochistic,  knife-loving, accused teenage killer.  So look closely at 16-year-old John Cadis.  Tonight, he's under arrest, accused of silencing one of the most well-known voices on New York  news radio, killing George Weber in a 50-stab frenzy of knife-wielding gore.  From his website, this ghoulish glimpse of the teenager who put his love for knives  on full display, posing here with a blade at his own throat. 
[00:34:30]  Tonight, police stand watch outside his home here in Elmhurst, Queens, where off-camera  neighborhood kids tell me they remember Cadis as a freaky firebug, torching garbage cans  near the local park.  Oh, grace.  One of these kids.  Got a little bit of everything going on there.  And you don't have to pump it up.  Didn't get no daddy's love.  Anyone can pose with a knife up to their neck.  It's, you know...  Yeah.  They gotta pump it up.  Look, trust me.  It tells the story without having you to go, and believe it or not, he posed with a knife  right up to his neck. 
[00:35:00]  Wow.  This devil-worshipping...  He's got, like, the same anarchy sign on his logo on his page that, like, a hell of a lot  of people have.  Yeah.  Look, he's a devil-worshipper.  Look, he's this.  He's, oh, the knife to his neck.  He's just a douche, is what he is.  Cops busted Katis on the run at an upstate bus station after he reportedly confessed  to taking part in a drug-and-alcohol-fueled prelude to plans for kinky sex with Weber after 
[00:35:30]  responding to a personal ad on Craigslist.  What broke the case wide open?  Cell phone and Internet records that practically pinpointed the killer, who reportedly also left  gory evidence at the crime scene.  His own blood signs the 47-year-old Weber put up a struggle to save his life.  Katis reportedly attacking the duct-taped newsman when Weber somehow managed to pull  a knife.  One family member of the suspect, who is inside the courthouse tonight, refused to go on TV 
[00:36:00]  tonight to say this, but he did tell assembled reporters, quote,  There is stuff about the victim that has not been reported.  Stuff about the victim that has not been reported.  Oh, boy.  I can only wonder what the fuck that is.  That's a kinky-ass story.  This guy was into some shit.  Why don't they talk about that?  They talk about this 16-year-old, like a maniac, which he is.  I'm not saying he's not, but Jesus Christ. 
[00:36:30]  It's not like this news guy was walking down the street and was attacked by this kid.  Right.  He searched him out for rough sex.  Finds him toying about.  He was into some dangerous behavior, man.  He's into dangerous behavior.  Thank you.  That's exactly it.  He's into dangerous friggin' behavior.  They found pictures of George Weber in his room with, like, men and, you know.  Oh, really?  But, you know.  Can you tweet those, please?  Give us a little tweet.  Tweet. 
[00:37:00]  Tweet, tweet.  Wow.  Oh, buddy.  Was the 16-year-old a homosexual dude?  He says he was heterosexual.  So he was just, yeah, that's what I'm, I'm wondering if he had no intentions of doing anything with George Weber.  Hetero.  Huh?  How is he hetero if he's up there accepting ads from guys?  This guy was like, come on.  Well, how many ads did he accept?  Was this a one and done that all of a sudden the crazy got to him and he said, wow, here we go. 
[00:37:30]  I'm doing this.  Yeah, maybe.  Maybe he's more into the, you know, smothering thing.  I wonder if this winner of the sneaker, a bad sneaker competition, I wonder if it's worse than the sheets.  Oh, Anthony, let it go.  I just didn't say, what?  I'm not saying anything.  Let it go.  What?  I didn't say anything, really.  If you think about it.  If you think about it, really.  I didn't say anything either.  Yeah.  It could be anything.  Sure.  Whoops.  So there's your George Weber update. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, start talking about, I mean, every newscast I've heard on this, they haven't mentioned one thing about his dangerous behavior and lifestyle.  No, I think they have.  What?  I think it goes deeper, obviously.  Yeah, not deep enough.  They kind of gave you the bullet points.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  They all talk about, you know, a well-known, beloved newsman, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:38:30]  Right, right.  Like, you say, hey, what kind of creep was, you know, was this guy?  He might have been into some creepy stuff, right?  Oh, man.  It points toward that.  Duct tape him up.  They like to be smacked around like that.  Mm-hmm.  Rough sex.  Smother him.  They like to be smothered?  The hell's that about?  What happened to fucking...  People like something called mummification, too, which I don't get.  Mummification? 
[00:39:00]  What's that, Jimmy?  King Tut was into that.  Oh, Ant, don't be so fresh.  Oh, I'm literal, Ant.  Don't disparage King Tutankhamid.  Oh, by the way, before Jimmy moves on and teaches us something here, Larry Love from Philly,  yeah, 16-year-old, doesn't that make George Weber a pedophile?  Well, pederast.  Pederast.  Why all the talk of beloved newsmen when this guy is really a perverted kick-toucher?  You're absolutely right.  He actually was going to get fucked by somebody who's underage.  You're right, man.  That is weird the way the news is painting it. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  If that was a shock jock going to fuck a 16-year-old girl and she killed him, they would not be  attacking the 16-year-old girl.  And I'm not saying that this kid's not a piece of shit.  Yeah.  But they're not saying anything even about what a kinky freak Weber was.  Right.  You're right.  It's a good point.  You know how easy it would be for a girl to defend?  Just go, oh my God, I was just in there and he got all rough and this and I had to stab him and it's okay, sweetie. 
[00:40:00]  You go home.  You go home now.  So, mummification.  Yeah.  I can make fun of anything, but for some reason, King Tut was off limits with me.  Like anything, pedophilia, murder, it's all fine.  But whenever you guys did King Tut, I'd be like, oh, Tutankhamin.  Leave Tutankhamin alone.  Yes, let's not disparage his memory.  And I would never explain why I had this affection for the boy king.  The boy king.  So, mummification, a lot of S&M got people into this and I don't get it.  They want to be saran wrapped with their hands at their sides everywhere except a little hole poked with her nose on her mouth and smothered with the mistress's ass. 
[00:40:30]  So, it's called breath control as well.  And then occasionally, she's got to get up.  Oh, of course she's controlling her life.  And then with her ass.  That's a nightmare.  Yeah.  That's why I'm stammering really bad because just the thought of what you just said just creeped me out.  Dude, it makes my...  Yes.  Like I'm going for a breath.  It makes it hard for me to breathe.  I watched those murder shows and a few people have died. 
[00:41:00]  I've been killed.  Sure.  Where they put the duct tape over someone's mouth and then they pinch their nose and just hold them there.  And it's like, I can't imagine that.  Let's get to fun stuff.  By the way, someone...  I thought this was the fun stuff.  Someone brought up the fact that the newsman, can he use any more adjectives to describe this kid?  Oh, I know.  Yeah, he went off, didn't he?  What was it?  Where was that again?  We got that, Danny.  Oh, Travis, sorry.  Radio man.  Sex date with devil.  Not perverted radio guy who is going to get fucked by an underage person. 
[00:41:30]  Right.  Right.  Let me hear.  I got to hear all the adjectives again.  Why'd you do it?  Go ahead and gawk.  It's not every day you get a glimpse of a self-styled, devil-worshipping, sadomasochistic, knife-loving, accused teenage killer.  So look closely.  Not every day you get a look at.  Vince McMahon should use that for his next wrestler.  It's not every day.  Not every day. 
[00:42:00]  Of course not.  Wish it was.  All right.  We're going to take a quick break.  Self-styled.  Self-styled.  Self-styled, right.  Quick break and we'll continue?  Yeah.  We've got a busy show today, man.  Righty-o.  We have, yeah, we got Judah Friedlanders coming in.  We have the band Anvil coming in.  They have a documentary called Anvil.  Did you see it?  I did.  Oh, good.  Yeah, it was very good.  You liked it?  I did, yeah, man.  I liked it a lot.  It was interesting.  It was really interesting to watch this band.  They were pretty influential on Metallica and Guns N' Roses. 
[00:42:30]  They were never big.  Never huge, no.  I never heard of them.  Yeah, this documentary's trying to say that they were sort of big.  They never were big.  They were on their way at the same time all these other bands were on their way.  Foundry's bigger.  Yeah.  Foundry's more well-known.  And this band was just left behind.  And the documentary starts with Lars from Metallica, the dude from Anthrax that's just  got to get rid of that stupid goatee.  Stop it.  Yeah.  Enough.  Scott.  Scott Ian, he might be a cool dude. 
[00:43:00]  I'm sure we got a lot of Anthrax fans, but enough.  We get it.  You want to be different.  You want people to notice you.  Stop.  It's 2009.  The thing is now.  For fuck's sake.  His goatee is now three feet long.  You're a big Anthrax fan, aren't you, Danny?  Okay.  No.  Danny, someone around here is.  He's actually a fan of the disease, not the band.  Did you know Anvil, Danny, who they were?  No, I'd never heard of them, actually.  Yeah.  So, Scott, his goatee is like two and a half, three feet now.  It's ridiculous. 
[00:43:30]  But whatever.  And Slash.  And Slash all saying this band.  Oh, Lemmy, right.  Lemmy was interviewed in it.  And they're all saying that, yeah, we all were influenced by this metal band outside of Toronto, Canada.  Did Lemmy know who he was talking about?  I think so.  I've spoken with Lemmy, and wow.  And the guys never made it.  They had some little success.  Yeah.  And then they had some success in Europe, but not much.  And they're now in their 50s, still trying to make it.  It's really a weird. 
[00:44:00]  Like, you kind of.  Hey, it's kind of sad in a way.  Because regardless of the fact that, look, they're not as good as Metallica, obviously.  But when you see guys that want it that bad, and they've been working for, literally.  They showed a clip of them from 1982.  An 82 clip.  And they were talking about, yeah, we've been together for four or five years, which applies 77, 78.  So it's like, since, I would love to know.  Can we get a list of like.  30 to 32 years they've been at it.  What was the number one show on TV?  I wanted to email Steve or Daniel.  I said, I forgot.  In what?  77?  Yeah, or 78, say. 
[00:44:30]  I would say either Fantasy Island, Love Boat, Happy Days.  No, Happy Days was probably falling off by that point.  Really?  60 Minutes.  Still on.  MASH.  No, Happy Days was in its heyday.  Is that 77 there?  Yeah, 78, say.  Yeah, late 70s.  You got Laverne and Shirley, who's number one.  Happy Days, Three's Company, 60 Minutes, Charlie's Angels, All in the Family, Little House on the Prairie.  Oh.  Alice, MASH, and One Day at a Time.  Used to be sad.  One Day at a Time.  Linda Lavin. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God.  Singing her own theme song.  Remember that?  Used to be shy.  It's me.  There's a new girl in town, and she's looking good.  There's a fresh new face in the neighborhood.  There's a new girl in town.  Shut up, and then she'd end up on, like, Mike Douglas singing that fucking jazz shit.  Is it a fresh new face or a fresh freckled face?  Freckled face, yeah, yeah. 
[00:45:30]  I think they changed the lyrics.  They go, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  The end?  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  Yeah, at the end, she goes, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  There's a new girl in town, and she's looking good.  Shut up, you jazz shit.  Do we have it?  Can we go to break with that?  No, we got it right here.  Derek rules.  Sings her own theme song, Pompous Cunt. 
[00:46:00]  Wait till it kicks in.  Buried in Echo.  Here we go.  Hold on.  Here it comes.  Town.  God, she's sassy.  Her face in the neighborhood. 
[00:46:30]  There's a new girl in town with a brand new style.  She was just passing through, but if things work out, she's gonna stay in town.  New old, dried-up bitch with a fucking adult kid.  Right.  Yeah, she makes it sound like it was a young mother with a three-year-old.  Yeah, yeah.  You're right.  She's a young fucking milk.  The kid was a teenager.  Her face was already starting to dry out. 
[00:47:00]  She's a hagged old waitress in a diner.  You're a lasagna-bellied hash.  Yeah, no, you're no catch, bitch.  We went to the tough targets on this show.  New girl in town, look at God.  She just found a town where she could get the crystal meth nice and easy.  Wait, that was the word she said that was so bad, right?  God.  Makes you uncomfortable to hear that?  I can't even tell you. 
[00:47:30]  Heck.  Yeah, that whole...  She thought she was so jazzy.  And then she'd go on those bad talk shows.  Mike Douglas, the other one fucking...  What was his name?  Merv.  Merv Griffin.  She'd go on Merv, Dinah Shore.  And she couldn't just come on and talk about Stupid Alice, the show.  It's like, and as a lot of people don't know, Linda Lavin is an accomplished jazz singer.  Here she is with her latest song of her new album, Black and Gaz. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, and then she sits down.  I like the band.  How did those shows ever fucking survive?  We really were retarded like up until 20, 30 years ago.  Completely sheepishly retarded.  Merv!  That shit was good for its time.  Yeah, Merv's all right.  Linda Lavin being brought on.  All these stars wanted to sing on the shows.  It was the era of the variety show. 
[00:48:30]  And it was the let's just applaud everything and name drop.  We're going to get a lot more variety shows because the Osbournes.  You think that's going to be a...  Yeah.  Because I saw the...  There's going to be a lot of variety shows.  Because all these sort of variety shows do huge ratings.  American Idol kind of variety show, right?  Is it?  You know, not as much variety, but there's an entertainment thing.  Then you got the dancing with the dancing with the stars.  Does massive numbers.  But variety shows have to be...  A little of everything with stars and stuff.  Yeah.  It's not...  I wouldn't consider that. 
[00:49:00]  Those are more contest shows like that goddamn one with Ed McMahon, Star Search, and things  like that.  The variety show is a very odd fucking concept from the 60s and 70s.  Yeah.  Where they would just put people together and put them in situations where they're just...  They're not supposed to be in it.  And it's not fun to watch.  Well, Rosie O'Donnell bombed.  And she had Streisand on, and her special was one and done, I think, right?  She fucking tanked. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, that's right.  That's right.  I forgot about that.  And Rosie, for Rosie to tank, man, you know, because she's got that audience.  She doesn't have it in her anymore.  She's very talented, but she gave up on...  She never had it in her.  Yeah.  Well, good point, huh?  But she's giving up on everything.  She's looking...  Not food.  She's looking got a fresh, fat face in the neighborhood.  Fucking that affected voice.  Oh, she fucking stinks.  There's a new girl in town, and she's looking... 
[00:50:00]  And Vic Tabak, that fat Greek cock of his.  Oh, just fucking yelling at the girls, getting chest hair in the food.  Stow it.  That's what he'd yell when he'd put it in Flo's shitter.  Stow it, Flo.  He'd yell, stow this.  Oh, kiss my grits.  All right.  Hull, hull, hull.  He calls it grits.  Because it was a yeast infection.  It was like, nookie.  Just leave a ring of grits around your fucking bag. 
[00:50:30]  That's how you know that someone was fucking Flo.  They had grits balls.  Kiss my grits.  Stupid Vera.  Vera was a retard.  Yeah.  So she was an easy lay.  You know Vera probably liked to eat ass.  But woman's ass, not guys.  Vera was gay.  She would fuck herself with a hot dog or a Vienna sausage and eat Flo or Alice's ass  in the kitchen.  That's all she was into.  This is for the older listeners right now.  Oh, someone out there is losing it.  Stupid fucking Alice. 
[00:51:00]  Speaking of old broads, did you see the front page of the paper?  You got Valerie Bertinelli in a bikini.  She looks good.  Yeah, she's looking good.  She looks better in the one picture than the other.  One picture you see her belly button is down by her hip when she's laying on her side.  But the surfboard thing, the surfboard shot.  Yeah.  They're making a big deal out of the fact that she is back in a bikini at 48 years old.  She's 48?  The Jenny Craig spokesperson.  They're like, how'd you lose the weight?  She said, I just looked at my ex-husband's tongue.  I couldn't eat.  Stopped eating meat. 
[00:51:30]  I got douche chills as I was reading the article and it said, Eddie Van Halen, eat your heart  out.  Oh, okay.  Great.  Like, he's not out there, you know.  Yeah, you could still tool a few.  Exactly.  You just can't whistle at them.  I'm not good at cunnilingus, but...  He's tooling broads.  He's doing, you know, just fine.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Are you going to cunnit?  His tongue's just barely flicking the edge of the lip. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, shit.  She buys a cow tongue for the deli and says, you slap this on my lip.  That's a sport where you need the reach.  Yeah, yeah.  Getting back to that reach.  Yeah, you definitely need the reach there.  So what do you think of the Valerie Bertinelli?  And they're saying it's not airbrushed for the most part.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think she looks good.  Yeah.  Fuck yeah, man.  She held up pretty good even when she was fat.  You know, she went through her fat phase, but she always, like, still had that kind of, 
[00:52:30]  you know, girl-next-door look even as she got older.  Probably because she had a little Mexican in her.  Did she?  Who?  I just noticed that.  I wish I knew a little Mexican.  Valerie Villachos.  Oh, very good.  Jimmy Norton.  Very good.  She fell asleep and he fucking dove into her vaginous Fantasy Island suit.  Ow, it hurts.  She always had, like, that kid face.  Yeah.  I don't know.  There's just some nationalities, man.  The broads never age.  Their faces are, like, ridiculous. 
[00:53:00]  You know what I always hated?  The One Day at a Time theme song with the power where she goes, so up on your feet.  I've always had that song.  Oh, it goes, this is it.  This is it.  They have that awful one of us.  This is life.  We'll muddle through one day at a time or something.  And Mackenzie Phillips is doing vomiting drugs over the side of the couch.  In between takes.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Either throwing up her food or booting up heroin.  Oh, I know what part you're talking about.  Oh, Douche Chill coming up.  Prepare for Douche Chill. 
[00:53:30]  Up on your feet.  Brace for Douche Chill.  Here it comes.  Hold on.  Douche Chill.  I just had one.  We'll just take it like it comes.  One day at a time.  And Schneider.  As.  Pat Harrington.  Pat Harrington as Schneider. 
[00:54:00]  Makes a wacky face under the camera.  Yes.  Then he fucking wrenches Valerie Bertinelli.  Takes a fucking crescent wrench to her head.  And then ravages her in her room.  Yeah.  Gives her backside a good fingering with the dirty catacans.  And then pulls the cigarettes out from his sleeve and smokes one.  Puts it out on her belly.  Yeah, it's a palm all.  Why does everything have to be a battery and rape joke?  Why?  It's our variety.  We don't run a variety show.  Yes. 
[00:54:30]  I said that before, Jimmy.  Yes, I did.  No variety.  We can use a little variety at times.  All right.  We got to take a break.  The Anvil.  Getting back to Anvil.  So we're going to talk to Lips.  Oh, yes.  And the other dude from Anvil.  Who's in Lips and I'm going to guess Robo, the other guy?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Very interesting story.  And the documentary for you rock people out there.  I think you're going to enjoy it.  Rock.  And then Patrice is in it because I'm leaving, I think, at 9.30 or so.  I'm shooting for Z-Rock today, that show.  What's Z-Rock?  It's a show that Joan Rivers is on and also Lynn Coplitz. 
[00:55:00]  And Lynn plays the manager of a band called Z-Rock.  They're a real band.  It's kind of like Curb in the sense that it's not a real scripted.  You have scenes and then you kind of know what you're going to do.  Where's this show on?  IMC.  It's supposed to be pretty funny.  Well, look at you.  And I'm in Chris Jericho's in this episode.  So I'll see Chris today.  Oh, really?  We're not going to bring him the Anvil documentary.  He'll probably like that.  Oh, he'll love it.  He probably saw it already.  This is new, right?  What?  The documentary?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's just coming out.  Although I think the documentary stopped filming in 2007, I think. 
[00:55:30]  It seems like it did.  Right?  Or 2005 even.  But maybe when I saw it.  I saw like 2006 at one point.  They just gave up on doing the news.  Oh, I know.  They really gave up.  The anchor now actually comes out and introduces a stage show.  Yeah.  Now there's the what?  Those are the Nets girls?  Yeah.  Channel 11 drastically changed their format.  I think last week they started this.  Yeah.  It's now kind of a variety show. 
[00:56:00]  Variety show instead of the news.  They got the cameras zooming into the set, zooming out.  Yeah.  Now you're seeing the cameramen in the hallways.  It kind of has that.  Chick chat.  Sort of has like an SNL feel when they're setting up shit.  Right, right.  You see more behind the scenes of the set.  Without the talent, obviously.  Yeah.  You know a serious newsman on that show has got to be miserable.  Like they're eking the news out of this show.  I was reading an article that most of.  Oh, what the hell?  Well, I remember there really aren't any serious news.  There's people on that show.  The Younger Demos are saying that Colbert and Jon Stewart are just replacing the news anchors. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, I know this has been said before, but they're saying the Younger Demos are getting their news from Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert before they go to CNN or anywhere else.  You get enough news.  They're simply doing that.  Right.  Look at what's like now the stupid Nets mascot is behind him.  That's cute.  And that's the news anchor.  And that's the anchor.  That's kind of like how the host would be seen on SNL.  Yeah.  Kind of in the forefront with the act in the back.  And then he introduces and then he goes out of shot as they zoom in. 
[00:57:00]  And then she's doing like a CNN situation room thing.  Yeah, she's got a situation room thing in front of like a brick wall with three monitors.  Right.  It's a little discount version.  Right.  And then you got the old, you know, the traffic girl.  She don't do traffic anymore.  They have her out in front of the place.  Yeah.  Doing various things on a daily basis.  Right.  Whether it's jump roping with some inner city children or like this morning, sniffing sneakers from the world's sneaker, most offensive sneaker contest.  So, they've really switched things around at the old Picks 11. 
[00:57:30]  When are they going to have the smelliest sweatpants competition?  You want to enter that?  They're just waiting for a competition.  Yeah.  In a closet.  To work out after a good squeezing one out without really cleaning up very well.  No, I've been doing a lot of not actual boxing but hitting the heavy bag.  Yeah.  And sometimes I do with my sweatpants, no underwear.  So, just imagine what that smells like when I'm talking.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Oh, boy. 
[00:58:00]  Does it just move around like the speed bag when you're hitting the heavy bag?  See, that's a joke because you would lose a nut if you did that.  Of course.  You got to keep those nuts hoisted.  You got to tighten those up.  Put them somewhere.  You got to tighten the nuts before you hit the heavy bag.  Put those away.  Stow those nuts.  Sailor.  All right.  Why don't we take a quick break?  We've been trying to break for about 15 minutes.  So, what's up on your feet?  So, what's up on your feet? 
[00:58:30]  We said Judah.  We said Patrice O'Neill.  We said Anvil, right?  Yes.  A busy show today.  And I heard all next week, literally Monday through Friday, Bill Burr is sitting in with us.  Really?  Because he's going to be back east for the first time in a while for a week.  Billy, Billy, Billy.  Good.  I like talking to Bill about everything that's going on.  And he's got his own special little theories about everything.  I want to see if he saw the Obama deception.  That's the latest one for people like Billy.  Well, also, I know we want to go to break here, but also, I believe Geithner, the Treasury 
[00:59:00]  Secretary, is in a bit of a jam because he actually was almost agreeing with China on  the fact that China wants to replace the dollar as like a monetary unit.  They want a world money, like a world denomination.  How does no one, Bill got mad at me because I said this last time, how does no one understand  this is what Cocker was talking about? 
[00:59:30]  I know.  He's like, no, you're interrupting me.  But I was telling the truth.  That is what is happening.  Right when I read that, I thought the same thing.  I said, I remember this, we were doing it on the show, and Jimmy brought that up, and  he was like, you're out of your mind.  And then the reason the market kind of took a dip in the late afternoon is because stupid  Geithner decides to go, no, the Chinese, we might work with them in some aspects of  what they said, eliminating the dollar and having, what, quat lubes? 
[01:00:00]  No!  Well, this isn't going to happen anytime soon, though.  Hey, who knows?  In our lifetime?  In our lifetime, who the fuck knows?  I kind of lean toward Jimmy.  I think it's got to happen eventually.  Things are happening.  Look, the Euro happened in our lifetime really quickly.  Remember the Frank and the Deutschmark and things like that?  Yeah, but that just made sense.  How did it make sense?  They're all states.  For the time.  They're all states over there.  But it's like-  We use common money.  But I'm just saying that, like, Europe is, I look at Europe as the United States. 
[01:00:30]  They're all just individual states, but they call them countries over there.  But they, I know, right?  They're just little states.  But we look at it like, you know, different countries, kind of, they look at it like a  union of European states.  But that happened very quickly.  Yeah, it did.  You know, they decided, oh, we can get along for fucking 10 years in a row without one of  us trying to take over the world?  All right, let's have our own money.  I'm not an economist, but has that helped Europe?  I play one on TV.  Yeah.  Wah-da-wah!  I don't know if it has. 
[01:01:00]  Boo!  It's been in place for how many years now?  Has that helped Europe significantly?  Yeah, I think it has.  With trade?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Definitely.  And the euro gained value over the years.  So where does it go from here?  Do we get, like, one currency for North America or South America?  They were talking like an America, which is, like, taking care of everything.  But then you got stupid Mexico, who's just...  Oh, my God.  They'd need a wheelbarrow full of fucking pesos to make up for one America.  Yeah, but I love the stupid kids in class because then they grade it on a curve. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, they grade it on a curve.  Yeah, that was nice.  My B turned into an A because of the water.  Can I have an America, please?  It's just fucking truckloads of pesos dumping them out to you, and they flick them one.  Get yourself a sweet.  Well, there is kind of a world unit of money.  I mean, it's like the U.S. dollar can be used probably almost anywhere in the world.  That's true, yes.  We can.  Our money's like one of the only ones.  And the Chinese are saying that they don't want that anymore because they say our dollar is shit,  so they want some kind of world currency. 
[01:02:00]  And then when Geithner kind of agreed with China, or at least looking into it,  the dollar plummeted yesterday.  This Treasury Secretary is a dick.  He really is a dick.  That's all I got to say about that.  Well, doesn't he want to quit already?  They want to fire him, but it's one of Obama's big quick picks.  But I heard he wants to quit, and Obama's like not letting him quit.  Because it looked bad.  He had some problems, right?  It looks bad.  Yeah, the guy, he can't open his mouth without the market crashing.  He's made some awful decisions. 
[01:02:30]  If he's making a decision, that's one of those things.  Another thing.  Don't get me started or I'll go off.  And Hillary in Mexico is something we'll touch on a little later.  And where she's placing blame for the fucking unprecedented murder rate  with the cartels going on in Mexico.  You'll be surprised where Hillary's placing blame, we'll tell you.  Yeah.  We'll get a little serious today.  We haven't gotten serious in a while.  And the stupid MTA fare hikes here in New York City.  Yeah.  Doesn't affect Anthony because you do the car thing, but this is ridiculous. 
[01:03:00]  From what to what up?  What are they trying to go to?  They're going up 25%, Jimmy.  Jesus.  Like a subway ride, which $2 a subway ride was way too high.  Now it's going to be $2.50.  How do you not make money?  How do they not make fucking money?  That's what they do.  When the times are tough, they just stick their dick farther into taxpayers.  It's enraging.  I wish it was that pleasurable.  They are fucking, let me tell you, you know who's handling situations?  Over in France.  They're not being like, they said that Americans are taking our beef to talk radio. 
[01:03:30]  Those motherfuckers are taking business hostages.  There's a story, when we come back, I want to talk about it.  It's fucking great.  I love the French now.  They're animals.  No way, really?  They're fucking not, they are violent protests.  And they're hairy and they smell.  Damn, they don't want to work more than 35 hours a week, those lazy shits.  Fuck them.  I take that back.  I hate them.  We got lots to do.  The fare hike is ridiculous for people.  People don't have that type of money where you keep hiking their cheap transportation.  $2.50 a ride? 
[01:04:00]  That's crazy.  They should.  Look in God.  They should call it an unfair, F-A-R-E.  Well, on if he...  Yeah. </pre>
