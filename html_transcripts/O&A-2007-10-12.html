<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with the hosts complaining about others using their studio and tampering with their equipment. This segued into a discussion about a naked man strolling through Times Square, focusing on a New York Post photo depicting the event and the police officers' reactions, with particular attention paid to one officer seemingly staring at the man's genitals.  A listener caption contest for the photo was announced.  This was followed by a confusing radio contest offering a $1,000 prize to the tenth caller who correctly identified a short audio clip (referred to as "the rapping Duke").  The rules were deliberately vague, leading to many frustrated and confused callers. Frequent guest Jim Norton was in studio and contributed humorous commentary to both the naked man and contest segments. Several callers shared personal anecdotes, including one who admitted to streaking.  Other tangential discussions included Jim Norton's upcoming HBO special, Roger Clemens playing golf, and a man who tried to hang his wife.  The segment concluded with the playing of the audio clip and a caller claiming (though not definitively) to have won.

The next segment heavily featured the $1,000 sound-clip contest, with the hosts crudely dismissing incorrect callers with phrases like "wrong, try again, dumb ass" and "loser." After a lengthy, comedic exchange, a caller named Mike from New Jersey ultimately won.  The hosts then discussed potential new names for the contest, complained about their Philadelphia program director, and mocked local news stories, including one about a chihuahua riding a motorcycle. The ongoing "Is Tom Alive?" segment was updated, with discussion of Tom's health and his dedicated website. Extended discussions followed, focusing on a disliked "Fresh" radio station commercial, a "what the f" caller segment and their opinions on mayonnaise, and a football picks segment filled with arguments and jokes.  The show also touched upon an upcoming Halloween show in Boston, listener feedback, and further ribbing of callers.  Additional mentions included Jim Norton's upcoming HBO special and DVD release, and the hosts' opinions on San Francisco, its homeless population, and its large gay community.

A subsequent segment started with a discussion about a comedian's negative experiences with San Francisco's homeless population, broadening to include other cities with significant homelessness issues, like Cleveland.  The hosts shared their views on handling homelessness, referencing Rudy Giuliani's past efforts in New York City. A caller described a scene in San Francisco's Castro District involving men in "assless chaps" and leashes, sparking further conversation about gay culture and the hosts' perceptions.  Additional callers shared their own anecdotes about San Francisco's homeless population and the high amount of financial aid provided to them. Another caller discussed a proposed Nashville bill to outlaw feeding the homeless.  The conversation then shifted to classic Atari games and *Portal*, followed by a caller's experience at a San Francisco club with live bondage acts. A phone interview with Mark Wahlberg covered his career, including *Boogie Nights*, his musical past, working with Robert Duvall and Martin Scorsese, *The Departed*, and his decision to decline a role in the *Ocean's Eleven* remake.  The segment concluded with preparations for a live prostate exam of a guest named Pat Duffy by Dr. Steve.

The final segment focused on the live prostate exam of Pat Duffy by Dr. Steve, with extensive crude jokes about bodily functions and sexual acts. Pat Duffy's girlfriend, Lonnie, was present.  Pre-exam discussions included debates on the necessity of showering before a doctor's appointment.  The prostate exam itself was heavily commented on with vulgar jokes and descriptions, including a simultaneous testicular exam. Post-exam reactions continued the crude humor. A caller's question about a prolonged time to ejaculate led to further discussion and jokes with the doctor.  Opie gave sports predictions and discussed his "curse" of causing mentioned teams to lose.  Guests included Dr. Steve, Lonnie, Big Kev promoting his upcoming radio show, a guest from FMQB.com (initially misidentified), and Jimmy. A song with sexually explicit lyrics about "shitty dick" was played.  The overall tone remained one of crude humor and shock value.

[00:31:00]  that's really good jimmy yeah you got the red sox and the indians playing tonight uh  rocky's what beat the diamondbacks last night five to one and you got roger clemens on a golf course  didn't they pull the team off too it looked like they were throwing water bottles uh yeah they got  a little uh a little rowdy little rambunctious yeah that so they uh took him off the field for  10 minutes let the crowd calm down and did anybody notice that susan wallman looks like joaquin phoenix  i was looking at his stupid cleft palate face and i'm like who does he remind me of from the side 
[00:31:30]  because he like he has like a mutt face like a dog face you don't like his his hair lip he's awful  his face is just bothersome a lip yeah what movie is he in that new mark walberg movie i know what  is it called because we're talking to mark walberg today huh the night we own the night but he is  getting good reviews getting okay reviews where are we at with that movie i think it's in the 50  range on rotten tomatoes okay there you go what's it about how he tries to use a chapstick and needs 
[00:32:00]  four to cover the top part of that deformity to fill in the crevice like bondo on a car  and he keeps settling down and he has to refill it keeps dripping out hey gutter face i would just  get those old school like uh you know the wax lips you buy at the five and dime i would get those when  i know i'm just walking around and i don't have to talk yeah yeah hey we got something fun for  everybody oh say can you see by the dawn's early light what so proudly we have at the twilight's 
[00:32:30]  last gleaming so far so good all right so far so good it's it's a beautiful lackluster  rendition but at least he's uh on key on the hitting the notes and um and uh getting the words okay 
[00:33:00]  that's all i want to do all right  who's bought stripes and bright stars through the perilous  uh-oh wheels start slowing down  uh-oh you see how he's behind yeah because that's his brain trying to remember the words 
[00:33:30]  you know the words as they come out of your uh mouth yeah slowing down because he's trying to  think of the next line yeah this has to end horribly we're so gallantly streaming  and the rockets red glare oh the bombs bursting in air 
[00:34:00]  gave proof never gonna hit the end through the night that our flag was still there  oh say does that star-spangled banner yet wave last notes of a bitch  oh my god is that the that's isn't that the whole reason you sing this song right there 
[00:34:30]  the rest of it is just the big setup i don't think it's so much him forgetting the words as his  throat is gone at this point is it huh who is yeah who is that it's a cop oh at the u.s capitol  oh a little get-together at the u.s uh capitol you got a cop uh singing the national anthem  why'd they pick the cop who had the worst voice in the police department yeah here's the here's the 
[00:35:00]  big finish  all right come on come on clap for god's sake guy gave it his uh  his best come on you got to start that song like oh say can you see because it goes up so high 
[00:35:30]  by the end of it that's why people hate that not hate it hate it but a lot of people say that uh  we should have a different national anthem because that one is just so difficult to sing  that uh you know the average joe can't really sing it or uh had a very funny bit on this song  how it was about i think the war of 1812 which he said we lost it it was a really funny bit how  america the beautiful should probably be the uh yeah america the beautiful is a good one  but uh that one yeah wow the flag being there yeah yeah that was pretty much the whole gist of it 
[00:36:00]  rockets red glare yeah rockets red glare i kind of like that our whole national anthem's based on  bombs and stuff like that that's great bombs bursting in air if they're bursting in the air they miss  how about a bomb bursting bursting on the target yeah bomb bursting on soldier  i don't want bombs bursting in air that's a fruity fourth of july display  and this was before fourth of july now it's cool but back then if they're bursting in air 
[00:36:30]  they're not getting the job done exactly that means we conquered brooklyn there's a fort somewhere  where it's business as usual because your bombs are bursting in air the whole all the enemies are just  going ooh ah but that was before we understood what that meant  1812 for god's sake we get confused because we're all in awe of seeing that on the fourth of july but  back then there was no fourth of july yet um yeah i i believe there was was there one or 
[00:37:00]  independence day i think i don't know how it was celebrated i don't know when the firework things  uh came about as far as celebrating uh independence day i think they'd weigh a witch in the water yeah  yeah yeah way a witch uh with a chicken i believe or a goose and uh then i put the witch in the water  and if she drowned uh she was a real person and what are ramparts i don't know just do it in the  ramparts we want ramparts of those yeah uh on top of a an emplacement like a fort you ever see like the 
[00:37:30]  little notches taken out on the top no of a fort of a fortification oh yeah with uh yeah look up  rampart there uh ramparts we watched why would we ever look up ramp we're so gallantly streaming i  don't know what it means yeah yeah the song doesn't make much sense no all right hey uh how did you know  that i'm obsessed with this contest and just when you thought it couldn't get dumber we say hi to lynn  hi lynn how are you good what's going on why are you calling the show today um i'm very aware of the 
[00:38:00]  rules i know it's not time yet but i was trying to call yesterday and there is a bit of confusion  because in terms of the numbers if you put in o and a-n-d-a it's too many numbers so i didn't know  if it was o-a-n-a or the numbers it's just it's confusing in terms of what you need to dial right  so i want a correct number okay so you want the correct number yeah um i hope people understand 
[00:38:30]  how unbelievable this is so lynn you need the correct number to call us yeah to win a thousand  dollars right and what number do you think is the correct number well see i'm an xm listener so i see  the eight six six wow one oh wow number and then i know you said one eight seven seven two one two  o-n-a so i don't know which number to call what number have we told you to call the one eight seven 
[00:39:00]  seven two one two o-n-a right but again when you're putting o and a in is it o a n d a or oh my god  it's too many numbers well when uh okay lynn let's uh let's slow down a little bit so when you  punch in eight seven seven two one two o and a what happens even though there's too many numbers  well i haven't doubted that number because it's too many well let's see but but why wouldn't you  just give it a try and jimmy you want to talk about ann coulter next are you insane but madam we got 
[00:39:30]  to talk about poopy madam we got to talk oh my god coming up next on the opian anthony show we're  gonna talk about poopy castles madam why should we talk about ann coulter who we're dealing with  if you dial one eight seven seven and then the phone number said dial 400 r's right  what would happen if you dialed eight seven seven and then seven r's the phone would start ringing 
[00:40:00]  correct right regardless of how many more r's you put right the phone would start ringing got it  it that's all i needed okay yeah but lynn yeah you know in advertising and stuff they always use  like phone numbers that are easy to remember by like having a word yes but we all know that the  word has too many letters in it for an actual phone number but that has never gotten in the way of  people understanding what's going on like the most common phone number like to give out with a letter  would be a 1-800 but that's usually too many letters but you can remember it and spell it out 
[00:40:30]  and then the phone will just start ringing when you're on the third g right because if you call  eight seven seven two one two o and a yeah when you before you even start like punching the extra  numbers the phone will already be ringing okay all right that explains it i just yeah as some as  as some examples our listeners are um saying um yeah people say uh 1-800 dumb um right 
[00:41:00]  see if you started that uh before you got to the last couple of letters you know your phone would  start ringing and steven s from basher suggests that you dial one eight seven seven you dolt yeah  okay another one is uh 1-888 you stupid all right i got it you got it now got the gist of it 
[00:41:30]  thanks all right we're basically calling you stupid if you didn't realize all right i figured  that out all right good luck with the contest though all right thanks too many letters too many  letters let it be known by the way i'm shocked she did call 877-212-0&a well she had to ask her  question ask the question if it was too many letters the second the phone rang and it picked up she  should have just hung up and gone okay it works i am stunned i'm not that's why i'm like we have to 
[00:42:00]  dumb down this show screw ann coulter and getting into some serious political uh talk we got to  talk about poopy castles today she was uh she was struggling with the phone for a while too she was  like everything's muffled this is terrible everything's muffled ma'am it's upside down yes  right turn it around oh i was talking to the ear thingy stupid uh let's say hi to phil phil what's  going on today buddy phil what's going on man i just wanted to see if you could explain this whole 
[00:42:30]  thing to me uh explain what uh the numbers what numbers now i'm just being a jackass yes you are  all right let's go to gary in boston gary yeah i thought i had a stupid question what was your  stupid question it's like leave the 1-800 mattress leave the last test office savings yeah i think we  all i think we all understand when in advertising like jimmy said 1-800 sneakers or whatever if 
[00:43:00]  there's too many letters you just keep you just uh you just punch in until the thing starts ringing  uh you ready for my stupid question yes oh by the way you dolt is seven letters but it doesn't  matter the joke was still funny you dolt actually fits yeah yeah they're making fun of steven s from  basher's uh little line there go ahead uh gary hey the um the you know the uh eight eight six six  uh three one three free number is that in replace with the o and a number 
[00:43:30]  oh my god okay i can't um i i can't i just can't deal with this  are you all right over there i'm i am stunned i really was under the impression you know i'm still 
[00:44:00]  gonna have faith i know that most of our audience is not like these people that are calling i think a  lot of people that are calling are new people sampling the show perhaps because they know that  we're giving away a lot of money between 7 and 7 30 and only between 7 and 7 30 when you hear the  sound that we played the day prior and earlier in the show well let's make it let's make it even  easier 7 30 let's make it even easier this sound

[00:49:00]  children some registered sex offenders in the state of maryland will be asked to post signs at their  homes that say no candy at this residence on halloween unconstitutional it's what uncle paul  unconstitutional oh you you you you want to fight this man shouldn't have to hang a sign when he's  just trying to hand out candy to little youngsters oh my god i hate that boy trick or treat let me smell  your feet give you something good to eat yeah makes a little rhyme oh for the second straight 
[00:49:30]  year uh your little princess on you come on yeah the magic wand  uh yeah the uh probation agents plan a team with local police to dissuade sex offenders who are not  allowed to have contact with children from participating in the holiday why  uh why in addition to the signs all such offenders have been advised in a letter to stay home stay at 
[00:50:00]  home so you have to put a big sign on your front door and then you got to stay inside and they got  to be inside from 6 p.m on halloween until the next morning they got to leave their lights off and  refuse to answer their doors it's it's like insanity day for them oh you imagine a day where one day a year  you're at home and the hottest chicks just come to your door scantily clad yeah let's just come 
[00:50:30]  up with a new holiday so i can understand what's going on here and it's just hot chicks and hot chick  day hot chick day and you're like whoa damn there's a hot chick hot chick whoa they wear a little  outfit and you give them a little something something that's that's what this is for pedophiles yeah it's hot  chick day they have to put a sign on the door they gotta turn all the lights off and then they  just gotta sit on a couch and sweat all night just sit there oh my god that goodness out there and i  can't even partake poor little kids some creep behind his closed door sitting in the dark 
[00:51:00]  with night vision goggles looking out the window i want to go i want to go to kinko's and get uh  no candy signs made like hundreds of them it's just put them on people's doors just do the whole  neighborhood oh that's funny you gotta peek through a little letter did anyone say that the little  letter slot yeah no there's a reason though uh there will be some houses where it's a sex offenders 
[00:51:30]  house and there's not a no candy sign posted but in all those instances someone will be going to  the house to make sure the right thing is happening at that house so the authority right thing the  authorities will be dressing up as hot little kids i guess and uh knocking that work knocking  on some of these doors to make sure they don't answer i'm chris hansen i'm looking for candy trick  or treat why don't you sit down over there how awful is that you hear got any candy mister and you open 
[00:52:00]  the door with your robe askew that's a cop  because a pedo is so eager to get that door open oh yeah just open it quickly with your robe askew and the  wind knocks your robe open even farther and it's a policeman where's your sign sir oh i don't have  one yeah like the little things that tie your robe are hanging all all willy-nilly like you're like  a real uh like you're like a real rich guy yeah on his yacht but you're just completely nude and and 
[00:52:30]  you got one hand on your hip or something yeah hey hi oh yes yes yes are you a superhero no you're not  you're a policeman an awful big child dressed as a cop  a bunch of creeps uh i gotta just sit here i can't even get up off the couch don't get up  oh oh for the love of god go away oh just go away if it's a 
[00:53:00]  but what if he's dressed in a spider-man uniform showing off his tights  oh boy what do i do anyway help oh i should say something good evening  no my health doesn't allow it  hello anyone inside try the wine i was trying to get him drunk  yes these are the people too that get a little too into it 
[00:53:30]  look i've made a haunted house come on in yeah all right walk through my haunted house  but mister this goes upstairs yes it does to the scariest place of all the dungeon of horror it's  also known as my bedroom this isn't scary there's no ghosts or goblins in this apartment  there's just one little skeleton nailed up to the wall 
[00:54:00]  the real horror is upstairs  it's a fear that lasts a lifetime that you'll pass on to future generations right well how about the  the greatest guy ever the guy who tried to hang his wife in a haunted house yeah yeah this guy rules  yeah what's going on with that halloween stories starting a little early  this guy from spokane washington wanted to uh avoid divorce so he took his wife to the garage to  show her a haunted house he created and then he tried to hang her i love this guy because his wife 
[00:54:30]  was uh she's got like rope burns on her neck and apparently uh she didn't realize i guess the  marriage was going bad so he goes i have a haunted house to the garage and he made her climb the ladder  and tested the noose and then he turned up the radio and kicked the ladder out wow  test that noose honey while i turned the radio on and stupid put the noose around her neck and he  boots the uh the ladder out how the hell did she get down right uh while she was hanging there and  then she uh well see they said she often needs a wheelchair to get around but she was able to 
[00:55:00]  periodically support herself on her tiptoes and uh she said the last minute she was able to escape but  she had to promise him that uh she wouldn't divorce him and she'd never tell anyone what  he had done i guess that promise went awry i promise not to leave you or tell the police that  you're trying to hang me right now what a dope he is to believe that yeah at that point you gotta  like kill her that's under duress all right all right i'll take you out of the noose but honey um 
[00:55:30]  yeah test this guillotine i've made it's wonderful just put your head in there she really tested it  well she uh yeah yeah she she stood on her tiptoes and put her head in the old noose and  he boots the ladder out imagine imagine that visual is oh that is great as the ladder is pulled away  in her head you you could almost hear her go oh oh this i oh he's trying to no  yes he is i i'm choking how do you bargain with it while you're while you're being hung 
[00:56:00]  i thought you were hung you were dead quickly but yeah that's why it doesn't sound right like  why the hell how how did she escape that if she's up on a ladder and he kicks the ladder out was the  rope too long what was this guy an idiot well obviously yeah or maybe maybe he said like all  right here's here here it is if if you get if you get uh somebody to climb a ladder and put their head  a noose any anybody with any sense is going to go no what if the ladder falls so he might have said 
[00:56:30]  i left the rope long enough that you actually land on the ground it may it's going to make it look like  i'm hanging someone but your feet hit the ground and then he kicks the ladder out and her feet don't  exactly hit the ground and then what he does is he takes all the haunted house stuff down and he calls  the police and says my wife hung herself well we got a little more we got the oh this is how good  oh we got the new story a haunted house turned to a house of horrors for a horse and now 
[00:57:00]  horse house of horse wow no wonder he wanted her dead he wanted to have fun with the whores happy  whore day a haunted house turned to a house of horrors for a sports woman and now  her soon-to-be ex-husband is facing attempted murder charges kx y4's jeff humphrey is live at  the courthouse and jeff this was a suspect's alternative to divorce yeah the sean jennings  wife had told him that she wanted a divorce but before she could file the paperwork here at the 
[00:57:30]  courthouse police say jennings tried to kill her this is the jennings family garage and this is the  beam that sean jennings tied a noose onto he then allegedly lured his wife here into the garage and the  guys are checking out a halloween prop then have her stand on this ladder once her head was inside  that noose jennings allegedly pulled away the ladder and then as his wife struggled for breath  he told her that he hoped that police would feel that she had committed suicide 
[00:58:00]  ah he's talking to her i know like the end of a colombo episode yeah you see i tricked you when i  told you to climb the ladder knowing the whole time i was going to remove it  oh one more question i can't imagine how she would hang herself why would she do that with all  these uh uh halloween decorations around hot lieutenant it's it's a simple question she was depressed 
[00:58:30]  around this holiday season halloween all right well that fixes things clears things up oh one more thing  why is your shoe scuff mark on the ladder like that's what he would find yeah just a shoe scuff mark  sure why i was i was i was trying to help her i found her uh in the throes of death and i try all  right you win colombo damn you i killed her there was fess up to it at the end you win again even though  supposedly i've never heard of you because this is my first murder attempt yeah good point 
[00:59:00]  i don't know how i know who you are unless i watch you on television hey they always confess to the  dumbest piece of evidence too i found a contact lens in the trunk of the car oh you got me holy  jeez i tried to kill her and stuff no it's my lens i just found that i was saying that  mob you got me lieutenant you are a genius oh you did it i thought it was the other guy  you ever see the one where there's a dead body in the wall with the pager and colombo calls the 
[00:59:30]  number yes beeps from behind the wall and the guy's like oh you caught just puts his head down  instead of going what the hell is that oh you got me uh more to the story here and i said why are you  doing this what is what wrong and he said because this is easier to it's easier for me to kill you  then go through the divorce however police say sean jennings seen here in court then low 
[01:00:00]  well i think there's a few guys out there that uh so that was that her yeah she sounds like her  voice is a little scratchy yours would be a little scratchy too if you were hanging  her larynx has been crushed by her own weight right just lost a little air there give her a break will  you i think there's a few people out there going i understand she's got to walk around like uh like  tuco from the good the bad and the ugly with that noose mark around her neck you kill if you miss 
[01:00:30]  you better miss really good or at the end actually what happened was clinny's wood fired and shot her  down yeah that's how she lived how it happened she fell on some gold you didn't go through the divorce  however police say sean jennings seen here in court then lowered his wife to the ground after she  promised not to tell anyone about what he had done and she remained silent until yesterday when  she phoned police from this walmart today a judge set jennings bail at a half million dollars and if 
[01:01:00]  somehow jennings can raise that amount of money today judge peterson also ordered jennings to stay at  least two blocks away from his wife tonight he's on a suicide watch inside the spokane county jail two  blocks away could could you just put your head in the noose on that lamp post no i can't get any  closer just do it dummy  two blocks should be further than that i tried to hang her 
[01:01:30]  wow all right well thank god she promised no you first i was saying thank god she promised not to  tell imagine if she'd been stubborn or somebody that i would eventually wind up dating just promise  you won't divorce you i'm not promising anything nothing just let me down let me down so i can take half  your money and call the police immediately  uh it's that's probably the first and even though it was um intentional the first in the long line 
[01:02:00]  every halloween uh season of people hanging themselves thinking they could uh be clever make a little prop  scare people if you put a noose around your neck and lower yourself down you're going to die  there's our public service announcement because every year some dopey kid hangs himself in a tree  at a a haunted uh little little scenario that they set up for the kids really yeah but you you guys used  to hang yourselves from the stage uh during one of your rut gut performance yes we did we uh 
[01:02:30]  just knew how to do it the right way when the curtain would open the entire band except for the  drummer it would be a little rough but uh guitar bass singer uh we were all hanging from the neck  and uh the curtain would open and we'd be about three feet above the stage hanging just swinging  and we would do a whole song like that how many drugs were you on back in the day all the people  loved it you didn't have the right people working for you and the right roadies that could figure 
[01:03:00]  that stuff out oh i i did everything all the special effects some s some s crap club on long  island is going to figure out how to hang a whole band and and no one's going to get hurt here's how  you did it it was uh and i don't suggest you're doing this at home even though it's it's pretty  foolproof there's no way you're going to hang yourself because there's not an actual noose around  your neck connected to a beam or anything we'd find the uh the uh beams on the stage and you get a rope 
[01:03:30]  you tie it to the the beam and hang it all the way down you make a giant loop of which you stand  on your so your your heels are your the soles of your feet are in the noose so now you're hanging in  a giant noose and then you put on a painter's coverall the paper ones and zip it up now you got  the thing coming out the back of the the neck of the uh the painter's suit then you take a piece of rope  not attached to anything with some velcro on it and put it around your neck so now it looks like 
[01:04:00]  the noose around your neck is connected to the rope that's going to the beam but they're actually  never even connected so if you fell or anything you would just sit there with a piece of rope around  your neck and how high off the ground were you guys we were about three feet off the ground  ozzy used to hang a midget in his app that's probably how he did it too it's like a  waist harness or something like that when yeah the romance would play he would just the midget would be  hung in a spotlight i wish he would just hang a midget you'd have a new midget because you they 
[01:04:30]  all look the same you would just kill a midget throw him out in the dumpster and buy a new one  the next day what are the cops gonna do uh did you see a midget what did he look like about yay  big large head a flat frankenstein hairdo  stupid midget  you really do have the worst dudes just buy little square hats for yourselves cut the malarkey  and then the uh painter's outfit and the way it was uh uh we were hung up yeah it made it easy 
[01:05:00]  to uh get out of the painter's outfit and then we'd have whatever we were wearing underneath you step  right out of the giant loop noose rip the velcro off your neck and within seconds you were rock you're  out of the uh little noose thing and you were rock you're all done you're rock it right here's the deal  yesterday we got a lot of email and phone calls from people saying that we didn't make the contest  obvious enough what it wasn't obvious enough well we do like to just subtly add it in i'm not sure  did it play did we get a winner uh yesterday break i know we just pop it in yeah we snuck the sound 
[01:05:30]  clip in people called and someone won a thousand i mean today have we done it today because i know it's  so vague no people got a little mad yesterday because because it was so subtle they got a little confused  oh okay uh so we figured today we'll make it completely obvious for everybody oh yeah monday  we might make it a little a little harder but today we want to make it very obvious that  oh that you need to call to win a thousand dollars to be subtle we we did subtle yesterday i wanted it  more subtle uh yeah maybe that's the way we should have went with this bit huh 
[01:06:00]  so it takes away from the drama of the whole thing i love how we worked out  no irony there folks turn up your radios because we're going to play a loud sound  shortly it almost makes it like we are a real wacky shock jock show then you read the schedule  that's for next week i love how we worked out our bits live do it on the air what the hell well is it  necessary to uh maybe there's no need for certain things to be done now when there's always uh next 
[01:06:30]  week yeah no because no um no well let's uh let's make it very uh very uh subtle that you need to  call to win a thousand dollars oh brother god did i get ready to call  boopie and anthony's sound of the day you can win one thousand dollars  coming up in moments  get ready to call

[01:17:30]  but right now we really need all the uh uh contest pigs to stop calling the show  oh stop just stop thank you please  what uh richard from kentucky what's up buddy  yeah is this open what is this open yeah is this open yes 
[01:18:00]  yeah what's your problem you got a mouth there talking about southerners oh my god this is the  worst thank you richard from kentucky it's the worst fake southern accent all right and he he's  claiming that i'm calling southerners dumb no i said there's just dumb people that listen to our show  they all have in the south jimmy said that they live in the south all right i think the phones are 
[01:18:30]  finally calming down so hey yeah we need a a clip for monday's contest yes and as soon as we play  this they're going to start calling again do not call we gave away the thousand dollars the next  chance is monday between 7 and 7 30 monday please don't call for the contest we gave away the money  for today only one time per show so here comes the sound here comes the sound for monday  monday between seven and seven thirty if you hear this sound uh call and you could win a thousand 
[01:19:00]  dollars it's monday monday between seven and seven and we change the sound every day yes so now the  rapping duke doesn't matter now we're just gonna play that because it's part of our show no i was  gonna say we can retire it oh no i like that one so it doesn't mean you call we already gave away  money for that sound clip we got a brand new sound clip for monday's show anthony has it it's going 
[01:19:30]  to be rough this one's going to be uh you're really going to have to listen it's not going to be that  obvious ready here it is that one you could miss that's it like it should be in the middle of a  cough like wow that would be like what huh what did i hear it so she's like and i'm like well i don't know  so when you hear that monday between 7 and 7 30 that's your next chance to win a thousand dollars 
[01:20:00]  okay uh action uh jackson what's up what's up boys hey you guys gonna be doing that every day  phrase that pays are we gonna do what every day phrase that pays baby phrase that pays it's not the  phrase that pays yes the word that bird i don't know what it's called well on one word you turd yeah  that's it that rhymes on whack bag they're trying to come up with a name for the contest and yeah we 
[01:20:30]  don't even have a name for this how about maybe someone could look at that thread and come up with  uh you know give me some of the better names that they came up with yeah it's kind of funny i think  i have one yeah we're trying to save markets so here you go it's a grand are you listening to chicago  where you tell a friend like immediately like immediately you put it on your mailing list right  let's just put it this way chicago we haven't talked to chicago in a while  if you really love this show as you listen on wckg you need to spend the entire weekend just going 
[01:21:00]  through the phone book calling phone numbers and begging people to listen to our radio show oh that's  a good idea there is and you can't wait you can't wait till sunday you have to start immediately telling  people about this show i mean immediately you need to get a phone you need to just just get the word  out immediately or you're going to hear fresh call like you were calling thinking you're winning the 
[01:21:30]  contest call that often or you're going to be listening to some really boring music on this radio  station yes i mean extremely boring but for some reason the women love it  of course they have cute little commercials here in new york for the fresh station  with the little feisty woman talking about how she doesn't like rap and she's dressed in rap  clothing and then and i don't like uh uh like rock or 80s music and she's dressed all 80s and then i 
[01:22:00]  like fresh and she's dressed like a dyke she's got her smart business suit on i like fresh and then she  has a black eye because i get fresh and i have to be straightened out can we play we play the fresh  commercial we work for the same company that just you know came up with this fresh concept and we hate it  well they say our show is a real buzz in chicago yeah yeah  and we do have a nice little and i'll say it a little following in chicago but they're really 
[01:22:30]  into the show and they really need to tell about a thousand people each yeah minimum  and they need to start now fresh maybe it would help at gunpoint that way yeah that way they can 
[01:23:00]  you know really force people to listen to us yeah yeah all right uh we'll find the fresh commercial  because that's what chicago has to look forward to if uh if uh things don't turn around immediately  yeah we'll give you a sample all right also um really fast uh we like to point out how the news  your local news is a complete joke here's here's today's example while this under too cute to be  true say hello to my little friend this is sinbad he is a chihuahua with a need for speed now unlike 
[01:23:30]  listen to him unlike other dogs the frisbee just won't do it for this daring dog his owner says he  just can't live without a ride on his motorcycle and kill him it's just too cute right by the  motorcycle and just sat there until he came out and gave him a ride and if i don't give him a ride  every day he gets depressed he's like really depressed so he's like he's got a ride that's  he's he's born to ride oh i love his glasses his goggles and sinbad's not only a speed demon he 
[01:24:00]  obviously has a good sense of style as i was speaking about those goggles show he's a passion for fashion  yeah yeah that that male anchor is just like oh god look at those goggles yeah he's like oh god i  grew up watching walter cronkite i wanted to do what he was doing doing the doggy story right when  that story aired in the office uh travis turned around and said the war's over i guess the war must  be over when they're doing cute little dog on the gas tank of a motorcycle and all they showed was the 
[01:24:30]  the motorcycle going around in circles in a parking lot two miles an hour yeah two miles an hour with  a dog wearing stupid goggles that looked like it was gouging his bulging chihuahua eyes out how great  would it be if they went and this should be filed under too cute to be true a washington man told his  wife she was testing a halloween haunted house hangman's noose and then he kicked the ladder out  this should be filed under too cute to be true pedophiles are being forced to hang signs that say 
[01:25:00]  no candy at this home oh god i want to do the news for one day they just are are i want to pick stories  and and put them into categories so bad and and i guess uh the local uh channel five uh channel here in  new york that fox news is starting to copy channel 11's dancing thing well because uh dance friday 
[01:25:30]  on jill tv channel 11 here in new york yeah is a huge hit because they got a real hot woman doing  it young big huge implants outfits that she should be wearing to the clubs but she's doing the traffic  report i think she did wear them to the clubs and she like runs in last minute that's what we're  thinking and she you know so she's dancing for about two or three minutes and who's complaining i mean  she's very good to look at and then you got uh fox 5 attempting the same thing because i guess it's  working for channel 11 but their broads are uh a bit on the frumpy side yeah a bit frumpy yes then 
[01:26:00]  yeah fox has a whole new campaign centered around them dancing really like that's why you should tune  in is because why is the news dancing why is anybody dancing and thinking it's funny like it that i was on  a plane watching the end of the evan almighty with correll and at the whole end of the movie is  showing funny moments of the cast dancing enough with the wacky dancing no one laughs when they see 
[01:26:30]  it do they do that oh my it's it's not like it's everything that's wrong with soft comedy and again  i know that was kind of for kids too so it's not as big a deal but it was just they showed the whole  cast doing wacky stop unless it's michael j fox and he's trying to serve hot soup that's a wacky  dance i could watch for an hour hey speaking of what heaven almighty i skipped it is it is it a good  movie oh i would i please i i was it was on the plane did you i was rooting for the wings to rip 
[01:27:00]  off and that's the plot of course i didn't okay i couldn't i just saw i looked up and saw the end  and they were all dancing and i'm just like oh this must be funny it just looked awful and what  they did with that movie the uh the uh preview yeah was the movie and i know they do that a lot  but for evan almighty they pretty much did a five minute version of the movie it was like why even  bother yeah i don't think it was one of those moves where anybody really cared i know story i know  oh look and right there iraq was able to pop it right up yeah it's real funny they're all dancing 
[01:27:30]  look they're all doing wacky dances that's just fun it's a fun place to be they're calling it the  good day dance funny on my fox here in new york they're just dancing all over new york all over  these uh key locations in new york people are dancing so you know what it is i'm dumb and i  need a distraction from the awfulness of life yeah why not watch that it makes me feel good  fun hey let's say hi to bill in philly bill listening on ysp what's up hey what's up guys

[01:31:00]  website dedicated to you called is tom alive.com uh i believe so oh wow look at that this thing is  is just taking off oh yeah setting the world on fire so tom uh what what's uh what's the headlines  with you what's the bullet points what what do you got you're still alive obviously anything going on  uh not really you know oh wow your website's terrific by the way i heard some snickering in  the background because our staff decided to check out is tom alive.com and uh it just says yes 
[01:31:30]  says yes that's your website one day that's how much uh someone cares about you it's just it's a  white page with yes in the middle of the page really went all out they give the date it says as  of friday or october 5th 2007 yes you're still alive and now they're gonna have to update hey tom um  what what happened tell me one thing this week that really what you did that your breathing was very  difficult through uh i had to carry some heavy boxes and i dropped them off because i couldn't 
[01:32:00]  what was in the boxes match match sticks please let it be  poor bastard oh wow oh hold on tom let me please get laughing at that  because ants implying that your breathing is so bad that you were carrying like like one of those little  kitchen boxes of matchsticks and you couldn't take it so you dropped them like henry fonda at the 
[01:32:30]  end of on golden pond dropping dishes yes yeah why don't we uh why don't we try to figure out what  was in in the boxes that tom was carrying besides possibly uh it could be cotton balls i'm thinking  maybe a box of tumors oh box of a box of oxygen a box of air  yes styrofoam peanuts they were probably empty boxes that you just uh decide to put around your 
[01:33:00]  apartment to make uh clean up that much easier for your family oh steve from bay show is suggesting  it's a box of shattered dreams what could have been did you with a little box of gasps and you'd open  it up and it would go what was what was in the box i'm sorry i'm teasing you tom i don't feel right  about that you drop boxes because they were too heavy because you got a breathing thing that's  gonna eventually kill you yeah so what was in the boxes that you dropped all over the place  uh stemware glasses stemware stemware now where were you carrying it from from where to where 
[01:33:30]  i was carrying from the hallway i just moved oh are you dead are you talking literally like you've just  moved hey by the way um spectro from michigan what if you found out that tom wasn't sick at all  we met him at one of the virus shows this summer and unless he has a great makeup artist man this guy  is sick you're a little pale that's all yes i have a great power that has something to do with 
[01:34:00]  probably uh your blood not getting enough oxygen yes is it weird when you eat and all the forks  rush rush and stick to your fork i wonder if there were like uh you know new lungs in the boxes  from the neighborhood kid a brand new pair of lungs a box of breathe right strips  okay sorry no that's all right i i i fell apart too i was just gonna go with uh he was gonna operate 
[01:34:30]  on himself type of joke but i didn't have it all figured out me neither i did all right we kind  of saved each other there yeah we just collided head on wasn't yours either all right tom anything  else you want to get off your chest besides the constant weight all right my my my my ribs  was that another attempt at yeah see anything he wants to get off his chest his ribs yeah implying 
[01:35:00]  they're too heavy for him to even breathe with ribs on wow all right tom that heavy weighted thing  it's a t-shirt hey uh by the way tom because we're stuck with this contest we get the best  suggestions from our listeners i want to give this guy credit he suggests that we play  let's do is tom alive every other friday oh from cape cod i like the idea is this the phasing out well  well well no because tom might die huh tom you know what are you you're not going to die soon are you

[01:40:00]  suffering is finally over right you're actually a better justice from caligula if you and your ex just  showed up and he weighed like two pieces of fruit then pointed at you  you see caligula there's a great scene when he's in bed and he's like got the fever and some guy's  trying to curry favor and he goes i would gladly offer my life to jupiter for you to be healed and  the caligula piped up and went jupiter accepts and so they had to take the guy off and kill him  and the guy's like jupiter oh that's hysterical the greatest they killed the guy calling someone 
[01:40:30]  on his wow there all right it was nice we like the stones bro we did enough enough for the people  all right uh let's say how to step but i was just figuratively i was the guy's like but you're not  how do you know jupiter jupiter accepts does he sorry chrisco by the way is saying uh the men

[02:02:30]  what's up paul hey there paul hey how you doing yes anthony yeah anthony why don't you like boston guy  i must i might have been a little uh a rash in saying that i think it just has to do with the time i  spent up there like i i had a great time with uh boston's uh with the people and everything but i think i  was just miserable at the time i was married i lived in a slum in ashland and uh maybe i took 
[02:03:00]  it out on the fine people in boston he's trying to do a bit but it's a real question people are  wondering why you don't like uh boston there now me and boston have this uh the people a little love  hate relationship it's it's definitely a yankees red sox thing but uh but there's a mutual admiration  and respect there and i was going through uh a great time of life you were living in a slum you  had a horrible marriage they had the two-foot rule there were a lot of problems two-foot rule they 
[02:03:30]  closed down uh the uh little red light district they had there that was during the time we were  there that was on its way out when we were there yeah but but i mean they finally you know did away  with it yeah that kind of annoyed me a little bit how could it not but uh the only the only problem i  really had was driving because i don't like that hub system they got there let's make a hub everything's  round and then there's little streets that cross in the middle instead of like a square grid so 
[02:04:00]  driving in boston was always presented a problem i would move back to boston tomorrow would you oh yeah  jesus that would make the show uh very hard to have to commute uh close circuit tv and let's be honest  i only got a couple years left doing this crap you want to just do it from our homes for two years and  then not do it at all at after that point two years at the crossroads here trust me why having  fun uh two weeks from today we'll be in boston for the halloween show yes and uh keep listening to bcn

[02:15:00]  anywhere else so i don't know i've been to many cities and i gotta say there are some good ones  around the country but uh pittsburgh's a close second it really is up to fallujah  um i uh fucking no no ona support non-terrestrial radio motherfuckers not motherfuckers uh  fucking boston's a great city san francisco uh a little too many of those no i like living with 
[02:15:30]  gay people hey hey see look i didn't even say what it was you were gonna go with the fact  thing and i'll let me tell you something about the fact that i went to san francisco for the first time  when i was uh not working went and uh i was in uh lake tahoe and uh i was in contact with an old  uh college roommate and he goes what you know it's not that far why don't you just drive you  have nothing to do i'm like i'm gonna drive to san francisco i've heard a lot about san francisco  and i went and i did not see the gay thing i wasn't even going to say the gay thing but when people 
[02:16:00]  talk about san francisco they're they basically are telling you there's like open butt sex all over  the place does there's i didn't see any of that i know me neither disappointed give me a ticket  know what i saw the hottest women in the world in san francisco they're not gonna be hassled  because everybody's sucking dick those were guys but we could have a little discussion about this  because san francisco gets a bad rap unless you're unless you're gay then it's a great rap sure and uh 
[02:16:30]  i'm i'm saying i didn't see any of that they have a giant gay community though there yes they  they they want to make like but it's sexual operations part of you know i get all that but  i guess there is a massively gay area but the rest of the city is uh is is okay i don't want to use  the word i was gonna say regular whatever yeah normal um no but when you talk when you hear about  san francisco you just hear gay gay gay gay like it's just everywhere i did not see that i saw some cool 
[02:17:00]  stuff there though man the seals on the wharf it's i saw the golden golden gate uh bridge that i uh that  i uh uh did a little rollerblading to uh i i did all the touristy stuff i went to alcatraz by myself  i saw the koi tower i saw uh uh that that weird windy road thing oh yeah yeah fisherman's wharf went down  there went to some unbelievable restaurants homeless people that lombard street or lombard 
[02:17:30]  is it yeah yeah yeah i don't know yes yes dr steve says yes but i saw uh dr steve you don't see you  don't see uh a lot of gay people what you do see in san francisco and and it's infested is uh homeless  people oh yeah because they're so liberal out there they're like look man let the homeless live among us  and that's what they do you'll walk into a really nice restaurant and you'll literally step over a bunch  of bums to get into the nice place see i don't like that at all and then i went to hate asbury 
[02:18:00]  or ash hate ash ash ash ashbury hate ashbury that was cool but that's now commercial and then i went  into the park and that was downright scary because there were just mobs of homeless people in the in  the park that was really scary actually and it was broad daylight see i think san francisco is such a  great city because you've been there right many times it's one of my favorite place we went together  actually yeah we went together we uh shared a hotel uh room proves my point you know one king  size bed who's looking do you remember how out of my mind i was that weekend i was really 
[02:18:30]  headlining i was just nervous and uncomfortable punchline which is a great comedy great comedy  club and i could not people are saying that you should have went to the castro district and that's  what you would have then you would have seen the gay the gay chris cox from la saying that cox that's  funny that his name is cox i like it because there's a lot of people unfortunately they don't go to san  francisco first of all because because they're homophobes and uh they think it's just gay  everywhere and that you're missing out on on an unbelievable city if san francisco was on the east 
[02:19:00]  coast i'd live there tomorrow tomorrow gay people keep very healthy city they like uh the bike community  is like this huge political group that get things done it sounds to me like it's very liberal  it's very liberal let the homeless go around everyone's in their ed begley jr bicycles and and  cars i'd be like the guy with the escalade just burning tanks of gas and and yelling at the hippies 
[02:19:30]  there's still hippies there yes i bet the hippies didn't even go away there's a lot of hippies hate  uh ashbury is trying to you know live the dream but it's it's so commercial summer of love man yeah it  was 67 and and the park filled with like homeless dudes and a lot of them are young people that are  actually really rich and they get off just being like homeless dudes oh that's good if that makes  sense and look a lot of people saying i mean i mean the homeless here let's go to casper in  connecticut he'll help me out here casper casper connecticut what's up buddy hey those out there 
[02:20:00]  were horrible uh there was a outside escalator they were standing at the bottom they wouldn't  let you get by unless you get them changed they were pissing everywhere it's a totally cool city but  they are out of control there is so many homeless people in san francisco another city that has a  lot of a major homeless problem is uh downtown cleveland downtown cleveland is scary remember  we walked out of our hotel while we were promoting xm and and the homeless people just start coming  at you like zombies like uh i'm not even kidding very aggressive homeless people in cleveland downtown 
[02:20:30]  cleveland yeah it's a weird vibe it was weird but san francisco is the homeless problem is is  it's just an infestation well see that to me is such a huge problem i wouldn't want to uh live  there that would like that would keep me from living in a place that's the that's the you know  the liberal mentality getting not checked whatsoever just completely out of control i like when uh  giuliani try to lock them all up here in new york city when he went around and gathered them up and 
[02:21:00]  said you know something we're going to put them in mental hospitals because these aren't the people that  are in shelters like families they like presenting homeless organizations like presenting homeless  people as if they are down on their luck they had a job they they lost it somehow fell through the cracks  of society and there are these families that end up in a shelter going oh my goodness when are we going  to get the car and job back and the house and everything no 99 of homeless people are insane  they're crazy people that are too crazy to fit into society and and live a normal life so they live 
[02:21:30]  on the street as crazy people and uh giuliani decided well let's take these crazy people and put them in  mental hospitals it'll make the uh uh life better for people that are working it'll make it a little  easier it won't stink as much and uh he did that and just caught hell for it had to open the gates and  let them all back out again yeah they're just walking around aclu came after him of course it  did just said uh no can't do that there's a homeless person right now waiting to just hit somebody over 
[02:22:00]  the head with a brick yeah that's it that's what they do someone's saying back the truck up and uh  and let's enjoy anthony's uh joke i swear i i i was on a little rant there i didn't even hear i don't  know you made a really fantastic uh i didn't make it good that wasn't a good joke it was hack i don't  me and fan me and fan like uh went back and forth a little during that what did you say i didn't  hear it i don't even remember it fan and do you think i'd say it to you jimmy why not i was i  honestly didn't hear it i think something about you're talking about san francisco and the guy who

[02:26:00]  all right here we go uh do you have ice hockey by activision i think you're ready for it one of  the roughest video games around for your atari game system ready to battle for the pot well to inflict  fierce body checking furious stick checking ruthless tripping you really think you're ready  for all that i'm ready i'm ready fine cash your charge oh and it just was like you said a box on 
[02:26:30]  skates wow look at the square puck going back and forth square it was pong with uh goals on the  there it is look at the graphics who the fuck gets excited about that it's terrible let's see an  etch-a-sketch but back then when it came out but that was cutting edge because you got pong and then  they decided to make sports games out of pong so remember they made like goals so there's small 
[02:27:00]  goal was like hockey then the larger goal was uh soccer you could play soccer squash right hockey and  it was all just pong it was just and they would change the goals hey uh nothing like portal let  me tell you the game came out uh the other day uh i can't get enough of it me danny fan we're  emailing and texting each other because of portal that came out in the orange box for half-life 2  uh the game's amazing level 19 by the way and i think that's the last level and i'll be i'll be 
[02:27:30]  done in no time but uh what a great game that is it's so simple that you're just making  portals to other portals that you make but it's it's one of the most addicting entertaining games  i've played hey there's my review thank you and graphics just stunning hey we got to go back to  the san francisco thing because i i swear i didn't see like this out of control gay thing that people  talk about uh when it comes to san francisco i didn't think there were people sucking dick on  the streets but randy is challenging me because he also went to san francisco and randy what did you 
[02:28:00]  see in san francisco this is the bit for today can you hear me yeah go ahead oh my god man uh my  wife and i went to san francisco for like a vacation right and as you're going over the golden gate you  start seeing all these rainbow stickers everywhere so you know you're you know you're like okay well  maybe it's a myth well we went down in this district and i must be in a wrong turn because next thing i  know literally there's guys in full biker attire with assless caps with leashes uh and other men  following them across the street to uh bars i think a bar was named so let me let me let me 
[02:28:30]  tell you something about the assless chaps you'll never ever see anyone straight wearing assless chaps  if you're seeing assless chaps you're seeing gay people that didn't really catch on with the  straight community no uh how bad do you need to be in the ass when the idea of unbuckling your  trousers and sliding them down it's an absolute burden and an inconvenience it's just too much 
[02:29:00]  work oh my god it was over the top i was uh yeah i do welcome it was it was pretty scary but uh hey  i'm a howard convert oh thank you ready you guys you guys are the best man hey ready i got i have one  problem with your phone call though i'm very observant you said we made a wrong turn oh no you know yeah  you're driving around frisco you don't know where y'all we're looking for like kate ashbury i have  a feeling you decided you wanted to kind of take in some of the culture oh yeah you know i i was  an ex-hippie so you know i was down there checking for hate ashbury but it is totally corporate now 
[02:29:30]  it's a joke so all right thank you sir it really is they it's too bad uh keith in san francisco what's  up hey how you guys doing this morning good hey uh you know talking about all the uh the homeless  stuff oh by the way that last caller he drove into the cassero district they just had a leather  flogging uh uh exhibition last weekend hey is that was that near the tenderloin because i've  stayed in the tenderloin years ago uh the tenderloin no it's actually it's kind of  wait wait wait wait wait wait wait what homeless people what's the tenderloin what's the tenderloin 
[02:30:00]  a lot of them is just basically skid row yeah for all the heroin addicts and crack addicts go why  there's the tenderloin wait is that near uh where the giants play uh the giants play at uh pack  ball park which is right in the embarcadero on the other side of the bay bridge that's  really bad right uh yeah it is actually dude i think uh i would say a meatpacking district  oh because i was in that area yeah it's not on not a purpose people i i threw my skates on one day 
[02:30:30]  and decided just to you know tool around and i ended up near candlestick park i was scared it was  really scary down there just take a cab different there's candlestick park and that's hunter's that's  hunter's point which is pretty dry really rough uh it's pretty much all housing projects there yeah i  i was really scared in that area yeah you you actually if you're white you really don't want  to go into that area assless chaps means that somebody said i want to your ass but those damn  pants are too time consuming and he missed out he goes i'm going to invent something where my 
[02:31:00]  asshole is available whenever somebody wants it it's really it's crazy up here everybody's lifestyle is  uh just out of control but i wanted to talk about the homeless population one of the reasons why we  got so many homeless people up here is because san francisco gives the most money for homeless  populations per month they get like 475 a month and all you got to do is go in and claim your check  and that's it yeah who wouldn't go there then and that's why a lot of people come to san francisco  including though including young people even though this community this area that we live in up here 
[02:31:30]  is really it's an expensive area and a lot of people like opie was saying it's real chic just to walk  around and just be homeless even though they live in multi-million dollar estates their parents do  yeah my uh old college roommate explained that he goes half those young kids that look homeless  they're not they're from really rich neighborhoods and they're bored and they come into the city  just to fuck around and pretend they're homeless and grab enough money for whatever beer and drugs  and stuff or they'll you know they're from berkeley they'll go to berkeley and oh and have their 
[02:32:00]  causes that mean nothing because they're completely out of touch with what's going on well there's yes they  do they got a bunch of assholes sitting in a fucking tree because they don't want to cut the  tree down yeah yeah cut it down with them in it i would love for them to do that someday a bunch of  idiots in a plywood house in a a tree to save it and then just watch them scream as it crashes down to  earth well you know that's funny you say that because i always i always think to myself it'd be great if  they say okay fine we're not going to cut it down as soon as they cut it as soon as they get out of the 
[02:32:30]  tree they go and cut it down yeah yeah why doesn't anyone just plain lie i know hey let's say uh  thank you sir chris uh cox from uh xm 81 the old joke is if you drop your wallet in san francisco  you kick it to oakland uh before you pick it up oh yes of course because if you've been over to pick  it up guys they'll get one up and you're wearing assless chaps do you imagine it being an assless  first of all you'd have nowhere to put your wallet in assless chaps because there's no back pocket  because that could interfere with a cock being ramrodded into your ass without a second's notice 
[02:33:00]  you have to need like i need a cock in my ass before my words are finished and these god look  at me i gotta unbuckle and slide it down down who has time by that time some other gentleman  with his ass already out could have a cock up his ass and i'm missing out how on the go is somebody  where an ass fuck will be ruined by the the the the fiddling with the belt buckle and zipper  well you don't want to give anyone time to change their mind that's true i realize what 
[02:33:30]  he's about to do let's go to fred in nashville tennessee fred what's up hey how you doing guys  good hello fred hi so here's what we got uh in nashville they're trying to uh pass a bill  right now that uh will allow or sorry outlaw uh feeding homeless people our population not  bad as far as uh homeless people go but they're just getting uh got a lot of conservatives in office  and uh they're ready to get that shit uh under control you know i i get a bad uh rap on this  show because i jumped on one lousy uh homeless guy's cake but i'm one of these guys that give 
[02:34:00]  money to the homeless i feel like uh they need it for something i love the people uh not gonna give  them money he's gonna just buy drugs with it ah fuck it they do here's your money here's your money  do whatever the fuck you need to do maybe it'll prevent from prevents uh someone from getting  you know hit over the head for their change with a cinder block or a cobblestone all right  sir a lot of people in nashville are also armed too so one of those big uh gunslinging states of

[02:42:30]  or something or it doesn't bother you no it's fine but usually i know if i go somewhere they they purposely  play it to see if it'll get a ride just to screw with you i just wanted to get away from it enough  to be taken seriously as an actor and you know as soon as you accomplish that it's all good dude  that's a a real um compliment to your acting as you were able to actually overcome uh your past and  what you did uh musically not that it was bad or anything but it was obviously it's dated now you  know it's one of those things where you look back and go kind of oh that was a cute little time of 
[02:43:00]  life uh but you know your acting is really overshadowed anything that that you've done  in the past so that's pretty cool yeah well i appreciate that that's why you know it certainly  doesn't bother dude you you have a really interesting career i mean from singing everything  he does just attracts chicks to a calvin klein model to like you know just one of the most respected  actors i mean do do you like get sick and tired of women throwing themselves at you  no it's not happening quite a while you know i got two kids now oh are you responsible i'm in a 
[02:43:30]  happy relationship but it's not a bad thing mark i gotta ask you for the job we're all boogie night  fans i thought you were one of my favorite things in that was the way like because you can obviously  sing so to hear you singing badly and making it look like you could was i thought one of my favorite  parts but the prosthetic at the end when they gave you that did you go look can i just wear this for a  few days i didn't want to wear it because it's so uncomfortable it doesn't have like a contraption  that allows you to go to the bathroom or anything but certainly wanted to keep it i gotta keep it 
[02:44:00]  like that hold me the clown pillow you know if you have to slap somebody just keep it on the mantle  it's uncomfortable because they feel crazy this this is a hot hot commodity people steal that thing  the chicks i mean obviously i mean it sounds silly but as a guy i'm watching that i'm going like  it'd be embarrassing because like you're showing that at the end of the movie so obviously girls you  know because women like don't understand that it's not real you know it's just a movie yeah  they're going to wind up like what the fuck what's where did it go yeah they respect it but you know  i'm doing okay did you read that script thinking it was what it was or or going like wow am i doing 
[02:44:30]  porno you know it it was a fascinating story yeah you know it was at a time where showgirls had just  come out too so it was like oh man this can either be really good or really bad it uh but you know the  more people started to commit like julian moore and william h macy and philip hoffman john c rowley  were like how can this be bad with all these really talented people yeah it was uh it was one of those  movies that still holds up i mean if that's on it's one of those movies that you just leave on 
[02:45:00]  uh yeah i'm not a big fan of watching myself either but that movie is uh it's so well made it's because  yeah like you said everybody in it was really good william h macy is amazing to watch in uh anything  he's in yeah you get don cheetle i mean the list goes on and on and how good i heard burt reynolds  when he did that like didn't realize at first what a great movie he had just done it was kind  of pissed off at his agent or whatever and then i guess once he realized like he was nominated until  he got nominated for academy award that he tried to change his tune he when he saw the movie he fired 
[02:45:30]  his agent oh jesus he saw the movie and actually thought it was bad how he thought it was racist and  homophobic and this that and he just he was the biggest star in the world for a decade and yeah  i have to say lines like put it in our a yeah it's true but he just had to do that laugh and smirk  into the camera for academy award he would try to say oh i love this film it's such a great experience  him and hal needham just had to make jokes for the outtake reel yeah i mean what's not dom de louise  chuckling wasn't in this one to me this was one of the i mean longest yards a great flick and he's done 
[02:46:00]  some great movies but i mean not in many years has he done something that's like that scene with  you and him at the end where you come back and you say you're sorry i mean that was just that  was fantastic reynolds hasn't had a moment like that in years yeah but he you know he also turned  down while he was at the height of his career some of the best movies that have been made what  he turned down he turned down like terms of endearment it was just one great role after another  why did he think that wouldn't go anywhere was that the nicholson role he turned down  yep i think he went on to do something like stroke erase 
[02:46:30]  something like that uh what about um how did you feel about planet of the apes the uh  remake uh or the you know re whatever they called it interpretation yeah reimagining it  bad but you know an opportunity to work with tim burton you know you don't really know what  you're gonna get yeah it and it got hyped so much uh and everyone was so familiar with the original  like i liked it i just was a little confused at the end you know and i think that kind of gets 
[02:47:00]  people when they can't just wrap something up at the end and walk out of the theater exactly and  when the when the original came out i mean you know the social climate was totally different yeah  it had so much to say and this one was really just to entertain but they didn't they didn't spend  the time which you need to to you know to get the script where it's where it's gotta be hey the apes  looks why we haven't done the italian job sequel you know we don't want to make it just to make  it right really like the first one and we want to make it better than the first yeah god damn i  forgot you're in the italian job too that was a good one this resume is amazing do you ever look 
[02:47:30]  back on something like as an actor like you know like uh and you look back on it you go  shit like i wish i would have done that better or or or any role you've done because i like i  ask musicians that too if they ever look back on a song and say i wish i would have done that one  differently is there anything you look back on and you go i wish i was better in that one  um yeah you know all you can really do because it's it's it's a hard thing when you're talking  about the the how you feel about an overall film as opposed to just doing your performance and being 
[02:48:00]  prepared and being in each moment you know especially when you're shooting all over the place you just  kind of hope that that it's all going to come together but it is really difficult to make a good  movie so you got to start out with the material all right and uh you know hope everything else comes  together are you uh are you competitive at all with uh your brother um yeah not in like roles it's  like hey dude you see you see the accolades i got and no nothing like that i mean no i started acting 
[02:48:30]  before him i always kind of considered it my niche um but he's very good at what he does  yeah and welcome you never worked with him in a  you never worked with him in a movie  well let me ask you you worked with scorsese and nicholson i mean is there anybody who you've  been kind of intimidated to work with i mean because there's there's guys that you'll wind up  working with that were probably legends before you started and is there anyone that you're on the set 
[02:49:00]  with that that kind of made you feel uncomfortable or nervous no when you work with talent like that  it really it elevates you so i uh i jump at the opportunity to work with talented people it's  when you're working with somebody who's inexperienced uh first time director uh situations like that  actors like rappers trying to be actors that kind of hey that method man is very good credit where it's  too yeah what was uh what was i was kidding yeah what was your favorite movie to do mark uh probably 
[02:49:30]  the m night shamalan the one i just finished yeah um oh good saying i like this guy huh we own the night  which uh starts today getting good reviews by the way yeah what's the movie about huh what is it about  we own the night yeah well it's about it's basically about two brothers of their their uh  their relationship their strained relationship i play a cop who followed in my father's footsteps  and joaquin is kind of the rebel of the family who runs this nightclub and now we're investigating 
[02:50:00]  these russian drug dealers who are operating out of his nightclub and we kind of ask him nicely to help  and he not only refuses he makes it difficult so we end up going at it it's uh it's a very very  well done drama who's our duval play the relationship between the family and the tension does duval play  your dad uh yeah yeah how's it to work with him that's like that would freak me out man did it is 
[02:50:30]  there any point guy in the world yeah he doesn't talk about westerns and barbecue and he likes to tango  too you should talk about tangoing robert duvall loves to tango oh i know i tangoed in a movie years  back so he uh he wanted to see what i had are you serious check out your tango chops yeah i wasn't  into all that i told him it's not that kind of role as a guy if duvall told me to tango i probably would  just to do it put your rose in the you put the rose in your teeth whatever his intentions were  yeah you um i was gonna ask you another question too shit oh you know what i loved also in um 
[02:51:00]  in uh the departed i thought was very underrated in it i mean uh was uh you and matt damon were  obviously fantastic and nicholson was great but how great was martin sheen at just making like a  regular guy interesting martin sheen was great martin sheen has always been fantastic you know he  originally wasn't cast in that role no it was that irish actor named jerry mcsorley who's been in a  bunch of movies you'd recognize him uh he worked on the movie for three weeks and then was replaced by 
[02:51:30]  martin sheen was it like a scheduling thing quote-unquote like harvey keitel in apocalypse  now or it was just no it was the director didn't like your performance oh wow that'll hurt yeah  when martin scorsese says beat it you stink yeah he did it didn't go over too well but you know when  you would it's tough because when you're you know they're spending a hundred million dollars to  make a movie and then you're you're on the set and what you're doing is not kind of what the  director had envisioned it's a problem well you you dropped out of uh what do you are the 
[02:52:00]  remake of oceans 11 you were supposed to be and you were replaced by that now is that your choice  yes i can't see them booting you out of a movie what happened you didn't like it or did you have  something else what happened was i would you know i had just done two movies with george and uh you  know i had the opportunity to work with a couple of other filmmakers and kind of go out there on my own  and uh you know if they would have waited for me um then i would have done that film as well but  you know with everybody else's schedule it just wasn't going to work and you know i was able to  go on and do italian job at my own height things and by the way i don't i don't regret it by anything 
[02:52:30]  there's a little confusion uh when you said you know when we asked you your favorite movie that  you made you said the one i just did uh that's the happening that comes out next year right yeah yeah  all right not to be confused with uh we own the night which comes out uh today my favorite film  because i haven't seen it yet but it was my favorite working experience yeah okay there was a little  confusion i just want to clear that up but the movie you would just explain comes out today we  own the night yes okay with duval and joaquin phoenix how is joaquin phoenix because he's got  this reputation like hanging up on reporters is he like a temperamental like method actor he's crazy 
[02:53:00]  but i love his death i mean you know one day he's completely one minute he's completely serious and  then the next minute you can't get him to be serious at all so he's kind of like an unpredictable  typical really good psycho actor yeah exactly but you know i love bipolar disorder i think he's a  super sweet guy so do you ever uh do you ever just kind of goof on donnie a little about the new kids  thing uh a little bit yeah i mean as a brother because i know i got an older brother and uh he 
[02:53:30]  tries to goof on me yeah i that's what brothers do they kind of goof on each other doing an interview  earlier and i you know i talked about why i didn't want to be involved in the new kids and i said  creatively it wasn't really where i wanted to go and then so he talked to them after and he  started bagging on me talking about creatively who knows what creativity is at 13 years old  i said okay well i will water it down next time i didn't want to look like a pussy  you know getting beat up in my neighborhood because of running around you know dressing up 
[02:54:00]  like michael jackson it'd be a little more edgy than that but no we look we love each other we  had a great time working together yeah he's doing great as an actor hopefully we'll get to work  together yeah that's that's cool man because i know brothers can really stick it to each other  and you both of you has got a little bit of fuel there and uh but you could be really proud of what  you're doing now man it's amazing yeah you know we i used to try to beat the crap out of my brothers  at christmas time you know even as recently as two years ago i was like what are you doing your kids  they're here they're cute yeah right you know i was it was a good you know 16 17 years where i 
[02:54:30]  got tortured by everybody i don't doubt it man yeah yeah but you dude you delivered the words hello  exactly oh i hold on one of our favorite clips here it is we play it all the time hello exactly  i love that one perfect is that he was so adamant about that whole situation and the music and oh we  we goddamn love that movie music bird to get a record deal because their stuff is that good 
[02:55:00]  this is fantastic dude these two just the magic that's on those tapes when he said the magic  is ours just just great man you're really a great actor you know that's this commitment you know you  just gotta believe and and hope that that the audience will be on board with you well they're  telling us you have to go there mark but um the movie is uh with joaquin phoenix and robert duvall  and yourself of course we own the night it does start today and uh man we're glad you called in

[03:00:00]  german wow seriously is that a problem well why would it be a problem yeah it depends on where you  live yeah how it does it depends on how many times you're moving your bowels every day yeah but uh  dr steve if i may yes i believe this has to do with his prostate being stimulated  as he is uh defecating you stole my thunder uh anthony i just want i just want to see if i 
[03:00:30]  uh i can compete with the doctor with the good doctor absolutely you know a urologist can actually  uh induce ejaculation by sticking their finger up your rear end and certainly can sure don't have  to tell me and why wouldn't they i've made them have to change that wax paper on the uh  counter quite a few times are you uh are you one of those doctors that have to stick the fingers  up the poop shoe i have done that oh my god can you do one of those today absolutely dude rubber 
[03:01:00]  gloves i ain't gonna get rubber gloves i know you're not look at them rubber gloves i've left for  to see where's pat duffy let's see how great pat duffy really is oh my god it's an actual physical  you would actually do this right now what are you feeling for he's a doctor he's a real doctor  well you know actually i can't practice in the state of new york you're not practicing you're  just feeling you're being silly what do you feel for uh in in a prostate when you when you stick 
[03:01:30]  your finger up there you're obviously feeling through the uh intestine or the lower the rectum  right uh with what are you feeling for when you feel a prostate well uh what the trick is is that you  feel a bunch of normal prostates prostate sorry i'm amazing every day day in and day out and then  you start to recognize the abnormal prostate because you got to do this pretty quickly i noticed yeah  like you can't be standing sitting there for a while with your finger up some guy's ass going 
[03:02:00]  i don't know let me check this side and that unless you're my doctor you go in  so you go in pretty quick pretty quick give a little feel right to left left to right up and down  and what does it feel like it's like a rubbery walnut a rubbery walnut about the size of a  walnut about the size of the wall it's supposed to be anyway and rubbery and then what would they  feel that like maybe bumpy isn't good obviously is not good enlarged is not good would it be hard 
[03:02:30]  if it was cancerous or something sometimes it could be woody woody woody  wow i have a question for dr steve all right this has been bugging me i have at times the inside  of my ear itches yes like everyone gets an itchy ear but i mean a lot yeah and it's i'm terrified  that it's because there's cancer knitting itself through my skull wow usually cancer wouldn't just  itch but the thing to do is i mean i know you have a doctor have them look in there if they don't see 
[03:03:00]  anything a little cortisone on a uh they actually make a cortisone eardrop that you can drop in your  ear and that'll get rid of it you think so absolutely is it seasonal i don't know in the  spring and fall i don't know it might it's been happening uh but not for that long are you very  waxy could it be waxy are you waxy you're waxy do you notice a lot of earwax uh an ear kit you can buy  a little ear kit at dwayne reid it's called a murine ear kit and you can uh lavage out your ear with uh 
[03:03:30]  this solution and then if it's wax that'll get rid of it you don't think it's anything serious i  don't think so but you know i'd have to look at those kits that you uh find for cleaning out your  ear that that's something that's uh worthwhile to do yeah it's a lot better than showing tips in your  ear yeah because you're just packing the right exactly peanut butter right see i i don't i don't  like the q-tip thing it gives me the heebie-jeebies yeah so get out of the shower i take a piece of  tissue yeah i kind of roll it up a little so it's bigger than a q-tip but not shove it in there so all  the wax gets uh a pushback but just kind of let it dab in there and sometimes you pull out a little 
[03:04:00]  surprise yeah yeah it's nice well um put it on a roots cracker oh yeah delicious i'm not being a  douche to you am i no no absolutely not you're my little pal i'm being called a fuckhead who's  are you serious because i'm like because you did the boring probably you douche we're just this is how  we show love on this exactly is it we love dr steve hey uh cue his music 
[03:04:30]  oh my god what oh that was this deep voice no no no no no no okay i got his name is pat duffy  there he is actually uh i got a commentary sounds like adam west adam west yes oh yeah man the original  batman batman cat woman wow he does impressions while he's got a finger in your hand that's right  he does these impersonations and if you're not coming from the prostate you think he was the 
[03:05:00]  good people you know what i i think for the first time i'm going to listen to 202 on a saturday night  yeah all right sorry lightsaber noises and everything there's there's a light oh my god he's  pat duffy the douche his name is pat duffy sit down i think we finally found something you will  not do for the radio show let's see let's think about this he had uh pat from monarchy puke all  over his face he was the uh recipient of the baby bird the famous baby bird video what else have you 
[03:05:30]  done you uh yeah the the stapler to your forehead where you had to go to the hospital that was terrific  right uh also uh oh brushing your teeth with dog shit yes let's not forget anything else uh i think  that's it well you also brought us a bad radio that we exploited yesterday right oh and uh oh i also  smelled sandy kane's vagina and butthole that's right yeah well then this will be a piece of cake you're  a trooper would you uh take a prostate exam from dr steve live on our show uh we want to educate 
[03:06:00]  our fans today he's a real doctor he's a real doctor he's not gonna do anything stupid he's a real  dog in the name of health i will yeah well i don't want to though well let me tell you i really  know most people don't want to the first time pat has said i don't want to yeah and if you guys  don't have a rubber glove oh no we have plenty of rubber gloves they're fingerless though for working  out 
[03:06:30]  yeah the rubber gloves are uh in supply do we have any um ky yeah i'm sure you do we need uh ky  when that you know something when i go to my uh general practitioner and i have my yearly physical  exam and uh he goes through everything and why does he save that for last well you save the best for  last you save the best for last obviously because when he leaves the office because he's doing other  stuff and i look at the sheet and it's like a checklist of everything he's done and you know 
[03:07:00]  he checks the ears and the nose and for hernia and this that the other thing and then it's like i  see it there prostate i see it with the little thing not checked yet and i just sit there thinking  when is he gonna get to this goodness well two things you people always remember the last thing  uh-huh that they saw and uh you want to save the late the most invasive thing for last do you yeah  yeah yeah because if it once you've stuck your finger up somebody's rear end you're not going 
[03:07:30]  back and looking down their throat yeah oh okay that's probably true yeah that would make you feel a  little odd yeah i don't like the drive home after that my doctor uses a lot of ky which i do appreciate  uh the less friction the better uh but when i'm driving home i just feel like i should be driving to the  a hospital for a rape kit because i'm all squishy in the seat he's got squishy pants it's squishy and  then i got to take a shower immediately and when you take your underwear off there's just a line of  ky there and next time the doctor i assless chaps i'm going with assless chaps to the doctor so he 
[03:08:00]  can just right away do it and i'll leave it on the impulse yeah i don't understand opie's doctor  walking out of the room with the with the shit on his finger yeah shouldn't the thing that he wipes  it on be right you know it's all over the office by the time well he had the finger up in the air  and he was going to the lab with um he's grabbing a few cookies on the way uh there hey we just put  it on a card and you put a little developer on it and it's done yeah we uh have to thank one of 
[03:08:30]  our fine advertisers what is this this is juicy lube but what is juicy lube uh this is like wild  cherry lube that will be put on dr steve's wow pat duffy's prostate exam putting on two gloves  yeah put on two gloves it's pat duffy for god's sake pat how are we gonna do this because none of us  want to see your uh your anus we have to see the anus we can do a side now now from from my own  experience what is done is you have to lean over something yeah you gotta do so the back of that 
[03:09:00]  the back of the couch you're sitting on looks a pretty good height for you to lean over and hide  and uh get the old exam do this i'm sorry pat you don't want to we all have to do things we don't  want to do i've done more than my fair share eric hasn't what have you done for us lately i gave you  that's that's the theme of our show and by lately we always mean today today right right we once the 
[03:09:30]  show's over brand new show tomorrow and you got to perform anyone else lowering their voice because  dr steve's in the studio he's gonna get a gig from this because of the voice i just want to talk about  dr steve yeah i would love to see dr steve get a radio gear i know can you do more adam west because  he's got knowledge and he's a funny guy so it's like uh it's a good combination usually you get  doctors on the air and they're doctors yeah but you know you're funny guy got a good voice anybody  honestly did you ever have anybody shoot while you were doing prostate uh no you can do that on

[03:12:30]  bound up oh don't worry i didn't even want anybody going with that joke you know what with a quick  edit yeah i know did you just say you swallowed cum edit that together thank you they uh so so it was  determined by taking me to dr fuchs that uh a little anthony was constipated so i i didn't know i when i  had been constipated prior mommy would give me a little spoonful of something and it would go away  but this i guess was so bad that they put a uh what is that a fist a fist a fist up my ass suppository 
[03:13:00]  they put a suppository up my ass at seven seven years old and i was horrified they dr fuchs lays  me down and she had the german accent i think she was like world war ii uh escapee and uh just shoved a  suppository up my ass and i didn't know what was going on i'm kicking i was like oh and i remember  that vividly that's i keep searching for for that again rotten life impacted boy duties and then and 
[03:13:30]  then back to grandma's house where i made the biggest shit a seven-year-old has ever made it looked like  the hindenburg inside the toilet it was giant i was amazed at the size of this uh  shit i knew we would eventually get to poopy castle talk finally yeah yeah you gotta go there  poopy castle but that um that was first time any any doctor had fiddled around with uh that area but

[03:17:00]  it what uh what's the eta on uh pat duffy's girlfriend uh she's uh getting our way now so  yeah travis is meeting her downstairs and all right and then she'll have to go through and  four minutes of paperwork just to watch five's a good shot as long as we'll keep her quiet  should we take a quick break and then we'll do this next sure we can do that dr steve tomorrow  night big kev you're doing your geek thing uh tomorrow as well nine to ten thirty nine to ten  thirty uh big kev's uh big uh big kev geeks what is it big kev's geek stuff all right i was close 
[03:17:30]  big kev responsible for bringing kevin smith to this program yes our good pal who hopefully will get  us ben affleck and then that leads to uh president bush really oh yeah you'll say i just want to  say bennifer oh all right so we're going to prepare the studio for the pal talkers and for  the radio audience and for the live studio audience we have yeah out there yeah of course not oh that 
[03:18:00]  why would we uh take two on that and we have a fine live studio audience  oh there they go yeah wow yeah great look how nervous pat duffy is holy  shit pat you are really nervous no i'm just thinking about the after effects of this  after effects that like just the psychology you might have liked it the psychological factor of  it the zip code change to the west coast it's not like we're getting somebody like danny to bend 
[03:18:30]  you over and do something to you true this is a person with the knowledge that that is needed to  make sure you're healthy uh in that area and uh there's no problem you do feel a bit silly  afterwards i will say that but and a bit squishy just keep telling yourself it's okay it's a  professional pat i had this done because i had strep throat so don't worry which is a little weird  i know people think that's really a like a joke it really isn't that's hot i went in for 
[03:19:00]  strep throat and i gotta figure out my ass where's my uh good i hope it's gone i just have to say one  thing that has been in my head ever since you played it you've we gotta add it i remember when that came  out like and it was just i the first time i heard i was like this is the worst thing it's not funny  the guy doesn't sound like the duke oh oh maybe the duke should have been checked 
[03:19:30]  see if if uh dr steve would have checked the duke out perhaps he would have found something in that  colon it's true that meat that he uh hey does dr steve have big digits or what  yeah i can span an octave can you use the thumb oh you can span an octave  span an octave and a third so yeah i've got a pretty long hand so i hope it comes out all shitty  man oh no no have you you had that oh yeah now that's the point i have to ask you something because 
[03:20:00]  we've had this conversation before i before i go to the doctor for uh my my checkup i will go home  and completely shower and get very clean everywhere to go to the doctor opie says this is silly to do  and and that i'm trying to like impress the doctor and i say no it's just common courtesy  and hope goes no the doctor's not going to spend longer yeah with his finger up your ass if it's  like refreshing the smellier the better man you know the doctor's gonna get in and out and move on 
[03:20:30]  i actually start shitting and then break it off like the type where it takes 400 wipes and then i go to  the doctor you leave a thin mint between your cheeks you're cleaning with nice fresh soaps and stuff  fuck that no i just make sure i'm thoroughly scrubbed and we appreciate it like every see  that's what i'm doing it's a it's because he's going to do a better job you know if you bring in  a nice car to the garage yeah he's going to do a job make sure he puts down things so he's not leaning 
[03:21:00]  on it and scratching his keys if you bring a piece of shit car in there he's just he's not going to  care what are you going to spend more time in a nice car or a piece of shit a piece of  shit car you're going to sit in drive in and jump out nice car you're going to relax lounge out  that's what they do in your ass you want to smell the interior the leather interior  i i uh i i get a subway sub i leave it outside for about a week and then i rub that all over  my body before i go to the doctor it's wonderful yeah i think most of the doctors really don't  care either way i think it probably in the end just makes you feel more comfortable you wouldn't 
[03:21:30]  want a stink guy though to come in uh people are requesting that dr steve says i'm sorry i did that  no you're more adam west more adam west please yeah it's very mysterious yes  or not you do what you want what did you ask it's okay is uh is pat duffy's girlfriend i'm gonna tinkle  i'm gonna tinkle yeah i gotta tinkle too break and then we'll take a break we'll come back and pat  duffy will get a prostate exam live on our show it's first one ever and we can't wait i like to think of 
[03:22:00]  it as his first gay experience no it has it's nothing sexual first gay experience that we know  of it's not sexual at all it's it's nothing oh my god what happened all right and during the break  can we put some light on pat duffy on his asshole or just his face yeah let's turn the light or two  on i see a lot of lights but they're not on maybe we could brighten his face up because that's going  to be the show those rosy red cheeks when he makes that oh face oh all right we'll uh we'll be 
[03:22:30]  back state i don't know well if you turn 53 and you find it hard to pee you need a pipe  you're having trouble with erection gotta shove it up your rectum it's the pipe  or if your prostate is swollen on a photographic home with the pipe  let's go let's go get the pipe let's go get the pipe  and you'll know when it's starting because you peel your bugs part with the pipe

[03:25:30]  Shit dick is a close second, but I like my dick's all shitty.  At this point, we got to say hi to Pat Duffy's lovely girlfriend, Lonnie.  She's been on the show many, many times.  We like to bring her into the studio when Pat's about to do one of these things for the radio show.  How are you?  I'm good, how are you?  What do I...  Should be on.  Try again.  Just hit her right in her face.  You just hit her in the face. 
[03:26:00]  Maybe meet her halfway.  Should she just use another microphone?  Yeah, just come over here.  Yeah, sit down on the couch.  Get comfortable, because you're going to be horrified.  So you're working over at K-Rock, and you get the phone call that Opie and Anthony need you, right?  Yes.  Did anyone tell you what was going on?  Um, E-Rock told me a little bit, but not really.  Yeah.  Uh, your lovely boyfriend, Pat.  You see him leaned over a couch over there, right?  Yes.  Yeah, he's going to get a finger up his ass, uh, right in front of your eyes.  Yeah.  She's an awesome.  Yeah.  She's a keeper, man. 
[03:26:30]  She really is a keeper.  She is.  Thank you.  You guys still in love?  Everything's going well?  Absolutely.  Of course.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Very good.  All right.  Uh, Anthony's working the Pal Talk cameras.  I think we're ready for this.  Yeah, we got, uh, we got a nice, uh, tight shot on, um, Pat Duffy's face.  Dr. Steve, is he mic'd, uh, over there?  Because it's all about the face.  Uh, Dr. Steve doing his radio show tomorrow, Weird Science on 202 Saturday night, tomorrow  night, of course, at 1030.  Or you could call it weird. 
[03:27:00]  Now, I don't like that mic at all.  It's really, really driving me nuts.  Now, Pat Duffy, the important thing here.  Yeah.  Uh, for our viewing audience is that you look right into the camera at all times during  this process, okay?  Okay.  You know what camera you're on.  That one, right there.  Yeah, that one right there.  There you go.  Now, you're going to have to look into that camera at all times because that's the fun  cam.  That's it.  Not so fun on this side.  Oh, no, huh?  Let's Dr. Steve test his mic.  Hello.  Yeah.  That's good, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's good. 
[03:27:30]  Much better.  Uh, Dr. Steve.  Is it the Joker?  Hey, can you, uh, can you wiggle the finger around when it's in there or what?  No.  Well, he might have to test it.  Whatever you would normally do.  Yeah.  What we would normally do is, uh, you insert the finger and then you sweep from left to  right and left and then up and down to feel the whole process.  Just give him a little extra is all I'm saying.  Okay.  Whatever we'll make, whatever we'll make the milky stuff.  Sure.  Are we ready?  Um, we're hoping.  Pat's face. 
[03:28:00]  Don't put your head down, ever.  It's only in shame.  I'm sorry.  No, no face down.  Your face must remain up like that.  Can you lift your head all the way with your hat on?  What?  Yeah.  Is that half interfering with your head?  No, no.  That's a good shot right there.  We got it.  As long as he looks at the camera and keeps his head up.  Let him look cool, uh, Jimmy.  Please.  All right.  Uh, Dr. C, we're hoping he makes cumzies in his pants.  We know we're going to.  Right.  We have, uh, one problem, Pat.  You still have your pants on.  I know.  Yeah. 
[03:28:30]  Pat, um, must be awkward, uh, when you have to tell them to take their pants off.  Drop, drop.  Trow.  Take them down.  Sort of a funnel metal.  Doc, I know you really want to get to it, but after he takes his pants down,  let him get bent back over and in position.  Yeah.  Uh, and.  I have to pull my pants all the way down.  However Dr. Steve says.  They got to go to your, at least to your knees.  I got to be able to get to the, uh, business section.  All right.  Oh my God.  This is so.  This is very cool.  And you got the, the juicy lube in your hand there, Dr. Steve?  The wild cherry flavor? 
[03:29:00]  Got my glove on.  Got the glove.  All right.  What, uh, what suggestions do you give people to make it less, uh, uncomfortable, uh, doctor?  Uh, wow.  There's really no way you can make this less uncomfortable.  I heard some, I heard some people say that you're supposed to push like you're taking  a shit.  Wow.  No.  And that's news to me.  I guess clenching is bad.  That's kind of like pushing back, right?  Yeah.  Like push back.  No.  No.  Maybe my doctor's got a little.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Push.  Pull out your dick.  Yeah.  He's a pillow. 
[03:29:30]  Could you put your face in this?  How great would it be if Dr. Steve's not a doctor?  Just some listener that came for the walkover today said he was a doctor.  We didn't even check your credentials, did we?  Can I see a diploma?  That's all right.  All right.  Now, now, now, no one stand in front of any of these cameras or you will be shot.  Got the lube on my finger.  And no one talking then.  Assume the position.  All right.  He's assuming the position.  Wait, wait, wait.  Are we?  Doc, let us know.  Hold on, Doc.  You don't, you just don't go right in.  Yeah.  We got to milk this for another 10 minutes.  10 minutes. 
[03:30:00]  The lube is going to dry up.  Now, Pat, you ready?  Oh, yeah.  Pat, look into the camera.  I saw you put your head down.  Don't you put that head down.  I'm sorry.  I can't help it.  Doc, walk us through it.  Let us know what you're doing.  Yeah.  Take your time, please.  First, I'm approaching the area.  Okay.  Well, he sure is.  And I'm separating the buttocks, the nodial region.  I'm placing my finger on the rectum.  Yeah.  Ha!  Ha!  Head up.  And now we are examining the prostate.  Sweeping from left to right. 
[03:30:30]  Up and down.  Feels normal.  Ah!  And we're done.  Thank God.  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  I didn't see his face, though!  Can you see the finger on the palpoc camera?  Yeah, I just throw it in front of one of those.  Yes.  Put it right with the mic.  Wow.  Doc, don't run around with it.  He's getting...  Where is this?  Put it where his face just was so he could see it.  Exactly.  Pat, move your head.  Yeah, just...  It's not a toothbrush, Pat.  Move your head and let me zoom in on this here. 
[03:31:00]  That is the finger.  Wait, wait, wait.  Get the finger on the palpoc.  Yeah, let's get it.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  I hate this.  Perfectly healthy feces.  Hold on.  Oh, there it is.  Okay.  Yeah.  Perfectly healthy feces.  Why did you wipe your ass in a padded devil dog?  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  What do you think of his prostate there, Dr. Steve?  Perfectly healthy.  Yeah.  The thing is that most 20-year-olds don't have prostate problems that are chronic. 
[03:31:30]  You know, they may have some prostatitis.  What would be better is if we did a testicular exam because that's much more likely to detect  something that a young man might have.  Oh!  Now, uh...  Hey, thanks.  Pat, what do you think?  I say test his bag.  You can refuse.  Pat?  Yeah, I might as well.  All right.  I might as well.  All right.  Back to camera five.  Gloves.  All right.  We need more gloves.  We're getting Pat all checked out here.  How did it feel, Pat?  Like, I just took a really awful shit.  It was terrible.  I did on his finger. 
[03:32:00]  It was terrible.  And let's go to Pat's girlfriend, Lonnie.  Yes.  What do you think?  Um, nothing really.  Would you do that while you're blowing me?  Because that would be fun, Lonnie.  Jeez.  Hey, Dr. Steve, can you maybe give her a little pointer on how to make Pat, you know, ejaculate  if his girlfriend did the same thing?  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  What does she have to do?  I mean, it's just basically this technique.  In, sweep, left and right, and from the top down.  Are you paying attention?  Got it.  That's how the urologists do it, and it's an effective technique for expressing seminal fluid. 
[03:32:30]  Oh.  Oh.  And then you can look at it under the microscope.  Also known as cumzies.  Oh, wow.  He made this evil face, this, like, you furrowed your brow and went like, oh, that was man sex.  You made a man sex face.  Fuck.  You dared him to fuck your heart.  I did.  What was Pal Talk's reaction?  Oh, my God. 
[03:33:00]  They loved it.  They liked that one?  They loved it.  All right.  What are we doing now?  Checking the ball bag?  Yeah.  Sure.  Why not?  Yeah.  Checking for ticks and stuff.  Ticks?  How are we going to do this now?  You show your balls and he squeezes them.  Oh, all right.  So, can I turn around at least?  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah, we don't need to see your ball bag.  You want to check him out?  No, I'm sure he's packing five.  And I'm going to get on my knees.  Sam's right there.  Now Steve decided to get on his knees.  All right.  We got Pat's face.  Pat, look into the camera, though, Pat.  Now we're going to check for hernia first.  Oh, Pat.  This is on the right. 
[03:33:30]  No hernia.  On the left, turn your head and cough.  All right.  And now, we're going to check the testicular region for any kind of abnormalities.  Oops.  Oh, sorry.  Watch the dick.  Watch the dick.  Sorry, man.  And you're absolutely normal.  Wow.  That's nice.  So, we're good.  Normal, delightful set of testicles.  Delightful set.  Delightful. 
[03:34:00]  Dr. Steve finally comes to New York to visit us.  Look how we put him through.  Delightful set of testicles.  Oh, that's great.  Someone got confused.  Dog shit, Sniffer.  You're usually good.  Give her a little pointer.  She don't have a prostate.  I know that.  It's when she shoves a finger up Pat Duffy's ass.  Oh, exactly.  Everyone else.  He's got it.  All right.  There you go.  Pat, you're healthy.  I am.  There you go, Pat.  Did it hurt, Pat? 
[03:34:30]  No.  There was no pain?  No, it was like, it was really more of a shock, if anything.  It was just like, fuck.  Like, I wouldn't describe it as pain.  Your face kind of looked like you were in pain.  Hey, we got Florida Steve from D.C. checking in.  He's got a great idea.  I mean, Pat Duffy went through a little hell there.  And I think it's Dr. Steve's turn.  Would you allow Pat Duffy to give you a shit hat?  Sure.  Anything for the show.  All right. 
[03:35:00]  Wow.  That was gay.  I thought that was very good.  It was educational.  Yeah, was it?  As far as...  Explain the education.  Well, a lot of guys probably afraid to go and have a prostate exam.  And if we could have fun with it here on the show, perhaps more people will think, you  know, I could do that.  Guess what?  Not everyone was having fun.  Right, Pat?  Yes.  Well, I wasn't talking about the person going.  I'm talking like, bring your friends so they can laugh at you.  That was my point of the whole thing. 
[03:35:30]  Gotcha.  Going to the doctor.  Yes.  Indeed.  What?  Jimmy.  I have to.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Where's Jimmy going?  I have to go.  Where's Jimmy going?  He's a big star now.  I know he is.  He gets to do whatever he wants.  I have to.  HBO tomorrow night?  Yeah, you're on HBO tomorrow.  On the road tonight and tomorrow.  But that show is sold out.  Those shows are sold out.  The four are sold.  Danbury?  Danbury's in two weeks.  I'm doing this.  Danbury.  The Danbury Treehouse.  And I'm also in Queensbury, New York.  Queensbury and Danbury? 
[03:36:00]  Yes.  A lot of brie.  It's the brie.  The brie tour.  Wait, my show is up against your HBO special?  I'm looking at it just the opposite way.  Uh-oh.  Yeah, right.  If I had my HBO special, follow this.  It's just an uneventful little man.  You can DVR.  I'm sure there's about 10 listeners that don't have HBO.  Dr. Steve, don't worry.  You can do both.  You can enjoy both.  Yeah.  All right.  Line of the day, really?  All right.  Yeah.  We have...  What?  Brian Ogre thing, too?  That's my new bit, talking to myself, because people talk to me now. 
[03:36:30]  What?  In the headphones.  Huh?  What the?  In this great state-of-the-art studio.  So you can play a long now at home, because I'll just start going, okay, yeah, that sounds  good.  Out of nowhere.  I've heard it.  I know you have.  Just go, okay.  Yeah.  Jimmy, all right.  We'll see you Monday.  All right, Jimmy.  Good luck.  Bye, guys.  Thanks.  See you guys Monday.  Monday.  Lonnie, thank you.  We're going to have to wave at each other.  Dr. Steve, I would never refuse Dr. Steve a handshake, but this moment I would. 
[03:37:00]  He was wearing gloves.  I don't care if he had a fucking catcher's mitt on.  Give him some Purell.  All right.  I'll see you, buddy.  I'm really glad.  Give him a tongue bath.  Bye, guys.  Smell his finger.  Yeah, smell his finger, Jimmy.  He's like, no.  Oh, you thought, though.  For a second.  No, you thought about it for a second.  I'm like, do I need anything plugged?  No, I've showed us all.  All right.  I think we're done, Ant.  I think we can do one of the day and get out of here.  We're going to do the best of 8-track porn so far, but we can save that for Monday. 
[03:37:30]  We'll save it.  We have an interview to do.  We're very big.  Yeah, we got, what's your name again?  It's Joe.  It's not Joe.  It's Mike.  It's Joe.  What?  He said Joe.  So I go, it's Joe.  It's Mike.  I think I remember his name.  FMQB.com.  It's Mike.  Big fans of the show.  I just remember.  We're going to be on the cover, right?  Yes.  All right, cool.  We got to get that interview out of the way.  Guy's doing a cover interview, and I call him Joe.  Well, yeah.  I know.  It's all right.  Audience, anything?  Did anyone come here with something that we never got to? 
[03:38:00]  Everyone all right?  Danny, why don't you get out there?  You guys all right?  Taking pictures with Jimmy.  Anybody have anything?  No.  We're good.  Chlamydia?  Chlamydia.  Any questions for Dr. Steve?  Well, somebody gave me some questions.  Hang on.  Let me find it in my pocket.  Oh, yeah.  There's a question from somebody that says, it normally takes me two to three hours to finish 
[03:38:30]  while having sex.  It's always been his way.  This is a problem?  This is a problem.  It's always been this way.  So that's an anonymous entry that we've received.  Yeah.  Is he on any medication?  There are Prozac and Paxil and Zoloft.  Some of the antidepressants cause that problem.  As a matter of fact, some people use them for that reason.  Right.  And I would have to ask him if he was on any medication or not.  Otherwise, that's a tough one.  And it's usually psychological.  Did you talk to your doctor? 
[03:39:00]  All right.  All right.  Jimmy, did you have something?  Jimmy ran back in, put his headphones on, then ran out.  We'll never know what he wanted.  Not really.  I just, I had kind of a weak joke, but I bailed on it.  The guy who said that he takes two or three hours to come, I said he has a disease.  It's called bragger-itis.  Oh, that had more potential than I thought.  That was a funny joke.  I'll bow out gracefully.  All right.  Jimmy.  Jimmy on HBO tomorrow night.  Oh, Jimmy.  Yes, come on. 
[03:39:30]  I think I'm taking pictures.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Did I get him?  Did I get him?  No, it's comfortable.  It's good.  We just.  Did I get him?  Out of the way, Danny.  Yes.  Why don't you hire a sketch artist?  Danny, get out of the way.  That's okay.  All right.  Dr. Steve, tomorrow night?  Yes, sir.  Big Kev, the big plug for your show.  I'm sorry that you went by the wayside here, but, you know, figure out Pat Duffy's ass trumps 
[03:40:00]  anything you have to say.  Yep.  My show tomorrow.  Big Kev's geek stuff.  Jesus, man.  I don't mind being brutal.  I have a finger up the ass.  No, seriously.  What do you got on the show tomorrow?  Nine o'clock.  Big Kev's geek stuff.  Nine to ten thirty, yeah.  We are going to be discussing the fall geek lineup and how it's been going so far and  a bunch of other things as well.  LARPing?  We will not be discussing about LARPing.  Fall geek lineup?  Yes.  What does that mean?  There's a lot of TV shows that are geek related. 
[03:40:30]  Heroes has launched a whole bunch of Beauty and the Geek.  Beauty and the Geek?  Sure.  Do you touch on that?  We do.  There's a LARPer in Beauty and the Geek this season.  That's right.  Any lost news?  Any inside info?  We will have some inside info.  You'll have to tune in tomorrow.  Oh, nice tease.  Look at that.  Nice tease.  Beat that, Dr. Steve.  All right.  Thanks, Kev.  Big Kev, everyone.  All right.  Line of the Day brought to you by BodogFantasy.net.  Free life scoring, stats, bios, and news that will help you win big this season in fantasy 
[03:41:00]  football.  All at BodogFantasy.net.  And I guess the listeners are playing Travis this season if they go to BodogFantasy.net.  Yeah.  It's pretty awesome.  It's pretty awesome.  Are you winning?  No.  I'm very close, though.  I'm like three or four games behind the leader.  We have like 600 people in the league.  Are you kidding?  Yeah.  Oh, you are kidding.  No, I'm not kidding.  No.  We have about 600 people playing.  I like that.  Are you kidding?  Yeah.  Can you get new people to play? 
[03:41:30]  You can, yeah.  You can try and catch up with everyone.  Sure.  See, they should.  All right.  Well.  I know.  I won't tell them how to do this.  No, I know.  They should have like, they should be able to play every week.  Well, we were trying to do something like that, but.  And then, you know, you would get a lot of people that would do this week.  Yes.  All right.  But for the 600 there, it's tons of fun.  That's pretty cool, actually.  All right.  BowdogFantasy.net.  Some lines of the day here.  Actually.  Thanks, miss.  Oh, you're a boy. 
[03:42:00]  A runner-up line of the day.  Grand Prix by Activision.  Grand Prix.  It's fucking, it's four different colors lines.  It's dicks with wheels.  Grand Prix.  That did suck.  I'm glad they're following the format for line of the day.  Take the last 15 minutes of the show and figure shit out.  Of course.  Well, plenty of good lines.  One mind, bitchin'.  I rarely get a mention.  I should be happy.  Thank you. 
[03:42:30]  No more lines of the day for you.  Thank you, Stan.  Oh, wow.  Thank you, Stan.  How's mother?  Giving you some shit.  The communication in my family sucks.  All right.  What do you expect?  There's your mother update.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  I carry some heavy boxes, and I dropped them off because I couldn't.  What was in the boxes?  Match, match sticks.  Please let it be.  Anthony, $1,000 on the Eagles.  Yes.  We'll find out how you do on Monday.  A grand on the Eagles because, Opie, very, very, you're very confident that the Jets are 
[03:43:00]  going to win.  We need a win, and we're playing at home.  Yeah, well.  It's a guarantee.  It's a lock.  It's a lock.  And the Cowboys will beat the Pats.  Just bet against everything Opie is saying.  Use any money laying around.  See, this is, like, I had to pick football picks, but these are the three I'm really feeling.  Jets over the Eagles, without a doubt.  Cowboys over the Pats.  You're saying without a doubt.  Okay.  And then the Red Sox, of course. 
[03:43:30]  Look, here's what I'm saying.  If you have to even temporarily steal money, if you have to, like, steal money and then give  it back, you'll be able to do it.  Like, borrow money.  That's what I'm talking about.  Get a loan.  Max out your credit cards on cash advance and bet, because you will be able to pay it  back, and you'll have extra, because Opie says it's a lot.  The Eagles.  Bet on the Eagles.  Another great game to bet on, Islanders-Flyers. 
[03:44:00]  Islanders all the way.  Oh, Jesus.  Okay.  Spoiling that home opener for the Flyers.  Opie is pretty much, what he's doing is he's giving out lottery numbers.  You're giving out winning lotto numbers right now.  It's what you're doing.  People don't quite understand this.  Look, my Islanders got their ass kicked last night by the Toronto Maple Leafs.  The new home of Jason Blake, one of my favorite Islanders of the last 10 years.  He'll break his legs.  Well, actually, you know what is happening with Jason Blake? 
[03:44:30]  He's got a rare form of leukemia.  Jesus Christ.  Land, you're laughing.  I swear to God.  Well, of course.  And he's my favorite player of the last 10 years, as far as Islander players go.  The Islanders couldn't keep him.  He was a free agent, and he went to the Toronto Maple Leafs.  I'm not lying, dude.  I love this guy, how he plays.  And it was just reported that he has a rare form of leukemia,  and he's taking some kind of medication so he can continue playing.  Am I right, Mike?  Yes, totally right. 
[03:45:00]  Dude, I am fascinated with this curse.  We've got to talk about this, because you have killed the Mets the last two years.  And I sort of bought into it a little bit, but I have totally bought into this curse now.  Yeah, it's frightening at how accurate it is.  It's not even, it's not one of these, well, sometimes he does this and that.  It's just, it's a lock.  It's weird.  I mean, all kidding aside, it's gotten to the point, it's really weird.  Yeah, and last year we sort of had a deal that you weren't going to mention anything about the Sabres, 
[03:45:30]  but you did, and they lost.  Well, no, what happened was, because I really am a huge hockey fan,  and I spent a lot of time at Western New York, so when the Islanders were knocked out,  I know Brother Weasel's a huge fan of the Sabres.  He got me into them a little bit.  I'm like, you know what, I would, yeah, I would like to see the Sabres win it all.  And they got knocked out.  Yeah, don't say that again.  Do not say that again.  Yeah, it could just be a casual, in casual passing,  he'll say that he wants a team to win, or a bet, or something like that.  And whatever he says, whatever team he really, truly wants to win, or thinks is going to win. 
[03:46:00]  I think we need to take action.  There needs to be an exorcism, a witch doctor.  We need to do something here.  I don't mind it at all, because he's a Jets, and a Mets, and an Islander fan,  so for me, I really don't care.  Yeah, I'm a Mets and a Sabres fan.  He kills my team both years.  And now Philadelphia.  Now he's sharing between cities, because now Philly's in with the Kurtz.  I loved what he did to the Phillies.  No one else could have achieved that, except Opie. 
[03:46:30]  No one could have taken the Phillies, and made them just completely self-destruct like that.  Three.  Except Opie.  Three and out.  Three, you're done with Opie's rousing endorsement.  They had a great year, too, and a great comeback.  Not just three and out, but an embarrassing three and out.  Of course.  They had all the momentum.  And this, I swear to God, the sports curse happens with big games.  Because I can pick games every week, and you wouldn't really notice it.  I'm telling you, it's when I have to pick the Super Bowl winner.  I mean, you know, who's going to win the World Series? 
[03:47:00]  It's creepy.  I swear to God, I can't tell you the last time I picked a winner in a big game.  You even jinxed your brother.  Like football picks or whatever, but when it comes to the big game, I can't tell you the last time.  And I pick a winner.  Well, I pick games all the time.  Your brother did great on the football picks last year.  Look what happened this year.  But I swear to God, Jason Blake was my favorite player on the Islanders in the past ten years.  And I was so bummed when he got traded, so I followed his career a little bit.  And it turns out he's got a rare form of leukemia, and he's taking medication so he can play. 
[03:47:30]  Well, at some point soon.  Fucking Maple Leafs ate one last night.  We're getting somebody up here to do something about this.  All right.  We've got a shy audience.  Well, your Flyers are fucked.  I don't like the Flyers, though.  We are going to spoil your home opener.  The Islanders, you know, horrible loss last night.  They're coming back strong and winning tonight.  There you go.  Tomorrow night.  Tomorrow night.  Tomorrow night.  All about that.  Where were we?  Oh, Line of the Day time?  Yeah, I think it's the winner.  BodogFantasy.net.  Thank you, BodogFantasy.net.  Here's your Line of the Day. 
[03:48:00]  Here comes Line of the Day.  Line of the Day.  Line of the Day.  Line of the Day.  Line of the Day.  Sometimes when I'm taking a dump, I'll come.  Like, I'll ejaculate.  Like, I won't be hard or anything.  Like, someone will come out.  Excuse me, right there.  Stop.  No disrespect, sir.  I don't even need the doctor.  I know what your problem is.  You're German. 
[03:48:30]  I use this!  The Flyers' home opener is not a big game.  No, that's what I was getting at.  It's just a home opener for the Flyers.  Our listeners are shy.  Yeah, what are you doing?  Well, I'm just trying to show the PalTalk audience some of the lovely fans, because we  get a lot of people think all our fans are just big, fat guys.  So, I focused on a couple of lovely ladies that are in our audience, and one of them is 
[03:49:00]  a little shy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She keeps hiding herself with her hands.  She's hiding her bosom.  Be proud!  She's hiding her bosom.  There you go.  She's hiding her bosom.  Her bosom.  Cover up your blouses.  Opie and Anthony are here.  That's one of my favorite things of the past year.  That stupid lady over at the old joint.  Oh my God.  Cover up your blouses, ladies.  Opie and Anthony are here to visit.  I know who Nora is.  That's what we do in our fucking personal lives is just, like, make girls uncomfortable about 
[03:49:30]  their bosoms.  Yeah.  That's our job.  All right.  We're just babbling.  All right.  We're out of here.  MikeFMQB.com.  Check that out.  Great radio site.  Dr. Steve, tomorrow night at 1030.  Weird Science.  Big Kev's Geek Stuff.  See, I'm not a geek.  What's the name again?  Yeah, that was it.  You had it.  Big Kev's Geek Stuff?  Correct.  Yeah.  Big Kev's Geek Stuff.  Okay, cool.  At 9 o'clock tomorrow night.  9 o'clock.  Right here on 202. 
[03:50:00]  Guys, we had a lot of fun this week.  Thanks so much for supporting the show.  Thanks to the audience out there, and we'll see you guys Monday.  Matter.  You got the touch.  You got the power.  You got the power.  Yeah.  After all is said and done, you never walk, you never run, you're a winner. 
[03:50:30]  You got to move, you know the streets.  Break the rules, take the heat, you're nobody's fool.  You're at your best when the court gets robbed.  You've been put to the death, but it's never enough.  You got the touch.
