<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a visually-driven segment comparing Andrew Dice Clay's appearance to Charles Nelson Reilly, sparking a barrage of vulgar, sexually explicit jokes and rhymes from the hosts.  This transitioned into Greg Opie's harrowing account of a disastrous Thanksgiving dinner, detailing his mother's self-centered behavior, incessant demands (including a disruptive request for an immediate ride home), vicious voicemails, and the deceased father's past role in buffering the family from her.  This Thanksgiving theme continued with a discussion of a homemade potato cannon, resulting in Opie's brother cracking a rib.  A caller, Jimmy, shared his experiences with similar devices and the various propellants used, including hairspray and acetylene, sparking a debate about legality and safety. Video clips of the potato cannon were shown.  The conversation then veered towards the NFL, specifically Tim Tebow's performance and a contrasting 60 Minutes segment on homeless children, leading to a discussion on the negativity found on Twitter.  Opie then launched into a graphic, detailed, and lengthy description of an unintentional three-hour foray into online pornography, focusing on his observations of the performers and comparing different ethnicities, including specific website mentions like "Clitty" and "BangUlater.com."  He also described frustrations with pop-up ads and fake chat windows.

The show continued with a heavy focus on pornography preferences, including a detailed discussion of amateur videos and production quality, interspersed with crude jokes and offensive language.  The Bernie Fine child sexual abuse scandal was then addressed, with the hosts expressing disgust and teasing audio for later in the broadcast.  This segued into a discussion of a purported topless photo of Miley Cyrus, sparking further crude discussion of female body types and preferences. A podiatrist caller briefly joined, prompting a discussion on medical specialties and fetishes.  An interview with Justin Bieber regarding his recent Today Show appearance followed, touching upon allegations of favoritism towards NBC executives' children for prime viewing spots and allegations of Bieber fathering a child out of wedlock.  Throughout this segment, numerous crude jokes and offensive language were prevalent, with mentions of scheduled guests Dr. J (Julius Erving) and Tucker Max.  A previous, potentially fabricated, story about Tucker Max was also discussed, along with a Woody Allen documentary and Scarlett Johansson's role in *Matchpoint*. The segment concluded with further Thanksgiving discussion, including an unusual stuffing ingredient and a story about a man whose ex-girlfriend used his frozen sperm to conceive children.

A subsequent segment featured Tucker Max recounting a disastrous sexual encounter involving a hidden camera, diarrhea, vomiting, and a broken camera tape, provoking disbelief and discomfort from the hosts (including Jim Norton and Sam Roberts) and other studio guests. This was followed by a merciless mocking of a music video by J-J-Julia (Raul Julia), focusing on its low production quality and the singer's performance.  A caller, Mike A., delivered a highly offensive and racially charged Thanksgiving monologue.  Julius "Dr. J" Erving then made a brief appearance, leading to a discussion of his career, finances, and golf game. A hockey fight between elderly CFL players was also mentioned.

Dr. J's appearance continued into another segment, focusing primarily on the NBA lockout and the subsequent agreement between players and owners. He offered insights into team financial struggles, the renegotiated revenue split, and the impact of ticket prices on attendance, highlighting the Philadelphia Sixers' new ownership's positive step in slashing ticket prices.  Dr. J discussed his career, offering opinions on LeBron James's potential, his own playing style, his all-time top five players (excluding Michael Jordan and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar), and a humorous anecdote about a basketball demonstration with Pete Maravich.  He shared personal stories about his retirement, daughter's tennis career, and playing with Maravich, along with discussions about the auctioning of his memorabilia and his appearance in NBA 2K12.  A significant portion covered the changing media landscape and the impact of instant news and social media, contrasted with his earlier experiences.  The hosts jokingly pressed him about his personal life, including a daughter born out of wedlock.  The segment concluded with a discussion of Dr. J's last game (shown on YouTube), further career reflections, and a mention of a hockey game and a particularly brutal brawl at a CFL awards banquet.  A commercial for Steven Singer's Argentium jewelry was also aired.

The final segment began with a discussion of a wrestler's death during a professional wrestling event, noting the show continued despite the death and comparing the frequency of pay-per-view events then and now. A live read for Brookstone's "Rover wireless spy tank" followed.  The discussion returned to the wrestler's death and the show's continuation, also commenting on a poorly executed wrestler entrance video.  A large portion focused on cookies brought to the studio by intern Matt's mother, leading to a vulgar discussion about their taste, ingredients (including a contentious peanut butter inclusion), and a humorous debate comparing Matt's mother and Sam's mother's baking skills using wrestling championship belt analogies.  The discussion devolved into insults and personal attacks between the hosts and Matt.  A running gag involved Roland's difficulty speaking, particularly pronouncing "church." The hosts mentioned receiving a Dr. J autograph and NBA 2K12 game (missing its case), leading to more banter. The show ended with further discussion of the cookies and Matt's perceived neediness, culminating in Matt throwing a cookie on the floor.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Sirius XM. The beginning of today's O.P. and Anthony show is just moments away.  Until then, here's some of the worst of O&A to keep you busy.  www.tdd.com has a picture of our old friend who's going to be one of the guys on Celebrity Apprentice.  Also, whack bag talking about this picture. It's Andrew Dice Clay.  Yeah.  He looks like Charles Nelson Reilly.  He's got these big over-the-top glasses.  He's got a Christmas sweater on. 
[00:00:30]  Big cataract glasses he's got.  Like, after they give you a cataract surgery, they put those giant glasses on you.  Yeah.  That's like what he's got.  And that sweater, yeah. What is that?  Is that a Van Heusen, Jimmy?  I don't know what that is. It's probably more expensive than the Van Heusens.  Van Heusen.  The favorite gift in the Norton household.  Here's a Van Heusen sweater. Condoms will not be necessary.  He can not look at a Van Heusen anymore and not think of Jimmy's gifts under the Christmas tree. 
[00:01:00]  They suck.  Wow.  I would act like Divine when I got a Van Heusen sweater.  Yeah, Dice looking really weird.  A little strange.  Don't get a picture.  People are saying Woody Dice Allen.  It's more, get a picture of Charles Nelson Reilly.  I really think it's more Charles Nelson Reilly.  I'm sure he doesn't want to hear that, but Charles Nelson Reilly wore those huge over-the-top glasses before.  Hickory dickory dock. 
[00:01:30]  I'd rather be sucking a c**t.  Oh-ho.  There you go.  And we're off.  And look, it's a perfect fit.  Jack me nipple, Jack me quick.  Pull that out.  I'll suck that c**t.  Oh-ho.  Oh-ho.  Dude, we found a perfect match.  He's wearing Charles Nelson Reilly's old glasses.  Oh, God, yeah, look at that.  Oh, God.  Charles Nelson Dice.  Oh, that's horrible. 
[00:02:00]  Oh, wow.  That is great.  He just needs an ascot.  Poor Scott-ass.  Oh, that's cute.  Any more rhymes?  I'm trying to remember what Dice rhymes.  Little boy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yes, little boy.  Oh, I needed the money. 
[00:02:30]  Mary, Mary.  Mary, Mary, quite contrary.  Oh, get rid of that c**t.  I'd rather have a c**t.  It doesn't rhyme, but it's true.  Oh-ho.  Oh, ho-ho.  It doesn't rhyme, but it's true.  Oh, that makes you laugh.  Old King Cole? 
[00:03:00]  Oh, there's the other one.  No, the plum pulled out of plum.  Oh, Jack Spratt would eat no fat?  No.  Is that it?  Yeah.  His wife would eat no lean.  I don't know.  I'll put it here.  When it's nice and big, I swear to you, it's clean.  Until it hits my spleen.  Those are glasses that are specifically made on Charles Nelson Reilly to just keep as much 
[00:03:30]  of that goo off your face.  Yeah.  I had to do a match game with bloodshot eyes many a night before I got these.  I feel like welder glasses, but he's not welding.  He's holding a bag and going, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Humpty Dumpty, three men in a tub.  Oh, yeah.  Humpty Dumpty.  Oh, they're coming in like crazy now, man. 
[00:04:00]  Rub it up, don't three men in a tub, yeah.  Oh, sounds good.  Come here.  Oh.  And now, and now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for.  Today's O.P. and Anthony show starts now.  Morning.  Oh, there we go.  Yeah.  I got to start by saying this.  Very, very, very easy.  We almost blew off turkey for Thanksgiving. 
[00:04:30]  Really?  We're sitting around, right, at my brother's house way out east.  And we're eating shrimp.  I love them scrimps.  And my brother brought some lobster tails.  And we brought out the clams.  And I look at my two brothers and I go, why are we having turkey?  Turkey's stupid.  Turkey sucks.  Turkey is so overrated.  And my brother Scott goes, you know what?  I was this close to just getting steaks and saying, fuck it.  I go, next year, let's just do that. 
[00:05:00]  Why do you have to have turkey on Thanksgiving?  Yeah, it does become this traditional thing that's like, fuck that.  I wouldn't like to have a steak instead.  I'm like, just get a little turkey loaf for the people that are traditional and the rest  of us will eat lobster tails and shrimp and some nice steak.  Yeah.  We were this close.  We were this close to blowing it off.  Fuck.  You've got to go with the whole tradition.  That's what I did.  Turkey's all right.  Turkey.  Mashed potatoes.  Mashed potatoes.  If turkey was so good, why don't we eat it the rest of the year? 
[00:05:30]  You might have turkey Thanksgiving and maybe two other times during the year.  Maybe.  Maybe.  So why is it so good then?  If it's, you know, you eat chicken all the time because it's flavorful, right?  Yeah.  Pork you eat a bunch of times during the year because it's flavorful.  Turkey sucks a dick.  Wonderfulness that is beef.  I eat turkey literally two or three times a week from our supermarket.  There's my area.  Oh, well.  No, no, no.  Fucking blown to bits.  Only because it's...  Why don't you tell me before I go on this ranch? 
[00:06:00]  It's low fat.  But I still don't get sick of it on Thanksgiving.  I fucking hate turkey.  Do you?  A little turkey in my egg whites every once in a while is all right, but...  Yeah.  That place we go to has good, really nice, fresh turkey.  Having turkey on a sandwich is different than having, like, turkey.  As long as you have the mayo and the salt and the pepper.  Well, a little cheese.  A little cheese?  What kind of cheese?  I like American cheese.  I'm thinking of some kind of a...  Yeah, it's a...  I don't need it.  How was everyone's Thanksgiving?  Oh, wonderful. 
[00:06:30]  Mine was great until my mom had to fucking ruin another fucking holiday.  Oh, no.  With her me, me, me attitude.  Oh, Jesus.  Good times, great oldies.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah.  What happened?  Well, I mentioned this because I guess people have really enjoyed the Mother's Day special we did.  I know it's not Mother's Day, but the Mother's special we did.  Yeah.  Great idea, by the way.  We had nothing to do with it.  Whoever came up with that one should get a fight.  I actually did.  Oh.  Give yourself a raise.  I lied.  My brother has the perfect Thanksgiving house. 
[00:07:00]  It's way out east on Long Island.  His house is right next to a farm.  It's very festive.  It just feels like Thanksgiving when you're out there.  And we dragged the old bag out there.  Oh, fuck.  The old fucking holy shit.  Oh, my God.  We didn't want her out there, but we got her out there.  And, you know, a few times during the Thanksgiving celebration, she said, well, I should have just 
[00:07:30]  stayed home.  Oh, no.  And we're like, we're not going to get an argument from us.  This is no fucking treat.  You know, I come in with my 18-month-old son, and she just stares at him like, that's wonderful.  Well, that's just horrific.  But anyway, so we dragged her out there, which is about an hour and a half to two hours from  her current abode.  Did you guys pick her up, or did someone else pick her up?  Well, that was the big thing.  Who's going to fucking bring her out there?  Because that's a whole thing now. 
[00:08:00]  So we bring her out there.  Who ended up bringing her out there?  My brother, I guess.  Yeah.  And we promised we would get her home.  My brother has a pretty big house.  She could have stayed there.  So after this long Thanksgiving, she starts carrying on.  She wants to go home.  I'm like, yeah, we'll get you home.  And she wants my brother, who's the host of Thanksgiving, to now drive three hours to  bring her home.  An hour and a half back to her house, and then an hour and a half back out to his house.  Which, logically, most people would understand is that's kind of a problem for anyone. 
[00:08:30]  So then my sister shows up after her Thanksgiving festivities for a little dessert.  So now we're like, ah, you could bring mom home.  This is beautiful.  But she's already in the mode, like, I want to leave now.  So my sister gets there, and of course, no logic in her stupid fucking brain.  She looks at my sister and goes, can you drive me home?  The fact is, my sister just got there.  She just drove the hour and a half. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, man.  So now my mom wants her to get back in the car and drive her home an hour and a half and  then come back.  That would be three hours for her.  She was kind of pulling a Judy.  Yeah.  I want to go home.  And we're all like, just fucking stay the night.  We're all having a good time.  You're with family.  I don't want to stay.  So then she started carrying on.  I want to go home now with that shrilly voice that I just enjoyed growing up.  Oh, man.  And then it bounces to the second generation, all my nephews and nieces. 
[00:09:30]  She starts carrying on.  Like, I swear to God, my 18-month-old has more maturity than my mom at this point.  And all the kids just put their heads down because they're hearing this fucking lunatic  screaming, like, I want to go home now.  I'm like, it's fucking Thanksgiving.  What could be the problem?  And that affects kids.  Yeah, of course.  Who gives a fuck you have to stay another hour or two?  Who cares?  It's Thanksgiving.  There's plenty to eat still.  You can chill out on a couch.  You can sleep anywhere.  So, of course, you know, eventually it gets to the point where everyone has to drop everything 
[00:10:00]  to make sure she gets home.  And then my sister was the one that had to bring her home, even though she was out there  only an hour.  Oh, man.  And my mom decided that, you know, that she wasn't going to talk to her the entire ride  home because it's now her problem.  Holy shit.  Closes the door, doesn't even say goodbye, and goes back into where she's living right  now.  Wow.  So, yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:10:30]  Happy Thanksgiving.  Well, it was good up.  It was good up until that point.  But the whole me, me, me starts coming out.  Yeah.  And she doesn't understand.  Everything has to be level 10 with her.  Right, right.  It was just a thing.  It's like, okay, we'll get you home.  Relax.  But it's not going to happen right now.  Yeah.  But you got, like, you got, like, 10 grandkids here.  You can maybe see what they've been up to lately.  Maybe make believe you give a fuck about my son.  Oh.  Maybe talk to your sons and daughters a little bit. 
[00:11:00]  Maybe have a little more turkey.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  That ain't happening.  Just wanted to go.  We're down in the basement with, like, kind of the kids' room.  She's at the top of the stairs like a fucking horror film fucking carrying it on.  I want to go home now.  You promised me.  Like that loud.  Really?  Wow.  I'm like, what the fuck?  Oh.  I don't know.  Oh, man.  And that put me in a fucking tizzy for a couple days.  That's making me so angry for you.  It's been my life, Jimmy. 
[00:11:30]  It's been my whole fucking life.  It's been my whole life.  Everything is level 10.  What level should that be, really?  Think about it.  Quickly.  Because I want to make sure I'm not misreading anything.  That's a three.  You got a mom that can't drive anymore, so she has to depend on others.  She chose to go out there for Thanksgiving with her family, and she absolutely wants  to go home by the end of the day.  Fine.  We get that, and she will make it there.  But what level should that be that it didn't happen right away for her? 
[00:12:00]  A one?  Nothing.  A two?  A three at most.  A three at most.  Yeah.  No, it's 10.  It's always a 10.  Even if it's a three, you should say to yourself, like you said, I can see the grandkids.  I'll kill some time.  Yeah, of course.  Of course.  You have to maybe think of others in this situation.  She rarely thinks of others.  It's, you know, take care of this me, me, me thing, whatever the fuck that is inside  her fucking soul.  And then now it's a problem.  You know, my sister steps up and goes, all right, I'll fucking drive you home. 
[00:12:30]  And she's treated with the, I'm not going to talk to you the entire way home.  My sister's like, you got to be kidding me.  What the fuck did I do?  That's fucked.  It's Thanksgiving.  I come all the way out here to see you guys, you know, and have a little dessert.  It's way out of my way to begin with, but at least when I get there, I'll hang out a  little while.  Why couldn't you put her on a bus?  God, I wish.  I did tell my brother, let's get a cab.  I'll just fucking pay for the car. 
[00:13:00]  Let's get a car.  Yeah.  But there's no cabs way out where he lives.  So, nah, nah.  Yeah, that is out there.  So she slammed the door and walked into her house.  And now I'm sure she's still fuming about this.  And then how does that get dealt?  Ever discuss it?  I know.  I stopped talking to her.  Okay.  But I mean, she did say to me, I've been calling you over and over again.  And I looked at her, I go, well, maybe you should just give up.  Half joking, half not joking. 
[00:13:30]  Oh, boy.  I didn't set up a voicemail for my new phone.  You know, Jimmy called over the weekend.  No one could get a hold of me.  Yeah.  Because one of my mom's tactics is to leave horrendously vicious voicemails.  Oh.  And that's the only reason why I don't have a voicemail.  Because people have asked me.  Yeah.  God bless you, man.  That's why I don't have a voicemail.  But thank God with our phones, you could see who called.  Right.  But no one could leave a message for me.  And that's because of my mom. 
[00:14:00]  Because these vicious voicemails will go right through your fucking soul.  What do they say?  They're just horrendous.  Yeah.  Well, the last one, which made me stop having a voicemail, was when she trashed my wedding.  Which was three years ago.  Yeah.  A couple days ago.  Yeah.  I just celebrated that anniversary.  She completely trashed my wedding.  She was the only one that didn't have a good time at my wedding.  Do the messages hurt, or are they just, like, enraging?  No, they don't hurt anymore. 
[00:14:30]  Because, you know, I'm an adult.  But they go right through you.  Just like, oh, my God.  What the fuck?  What the hell happened to you growing up?  If you listen all the way through, or do you just fucking douse them?  And we all have a way of dealing.  My sister's husband will listen to the voicemails that come into their house.  Yeah.  And he'll just delete them.  Because they're brutal.  They're brutal.  I don't have a specific example right now.  But brutal.  Just how horrible we are.  And this and that.  Because we didn't do such and such.  Or blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:15:00]  So.  What happened?  And I don't know this about a condition like that.  If everybody in any person's life absolutely cut them off 100%.  Like, would the person ever go like, oh, wow?  Or is it beyond that?  No, I don't even think she notices in the end.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I finally figured that out.  I think emotionally most of us have kind of detached from this.  Because you can't live that way.  You can't be on 10 all the time.  Right.  You could be annoyed and bothered that you're not getting a ride home right away. 
[00:15:30]  But think about it.  Thanksgiving, your whole family's there.  She bitches about how she doesn't see us enough to begin with.  So now here's your opportunity.  There's plenty of people to catch up with.  And she's carrying on.  She hit her time limit.  And that was it.  And that was it.  That's all she could think of.  Yeah, that's fucked up.  Brian in Virginia, my mom would have started to walk and then make everyone feel like shit.  Walk the hour and a half drive home.  When your dad was, would your dad have taken her ride home? 
[00:16:00]  Or would he calm her down?  Oh, my God, yeah.  Or would he be able to stop her?  Nah, he was a saint.  He was a saint on earth.  A saint on earth.  He really was a saint.  Now that he's gone, we're seeing the full effect of this.  And I don't know.  I really don't know how he dealt with this.  I have no fucking idea.  He shielded us from a lot of this shit.  But he's been gone seven years.  So it's been seven years where it's on our fucking lap.  Our heads, whatever.  Mommy Dearest 2 starring Greg Opius. 
[00:16:30]  But then it just puts me in a fucking place.  I'm like, oh, for a day or two.  Yeah.  And then I told my wife, I'm like, that's why I don't fucking want to hang out with family.  Because it just reminds me of this horse shit.  It's horse shit.  But we've never done anything that severe to my mom ever.  But she, I mean, she acts like, you know, someone was murdered.  I don't know why I'm bringing this up.  I guess this is the...  Please.  It's way more interesting than my Thanksgiving. 
[00:17:00]  It was a good Thanksgiving.  And my brother broke a rib.  Yeah.  Cracked a rib.  We were having fun with a potato cannon.  Catching fly balls.  And he took one on the chest.  It's on my YouTube page.  I think E-Rock's putting it on...  Oh, it's on our Facebook page.  What is our Facebook page?  Facebook.com.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Start this over.  This was fun.  My brother made his own fucking homemade potato cannon.  And everyone's talking about what he should have done differently and this and that. 
[00:17:30]  Everybody's an expert.  This potato cannon gun he fucking made with his son Carson.  Fucking rules.  I want a gun now.  A little PVC.  We're shooting the potatoes at trees and they're just fucking being pulverized.  We couldn't even find a piece of the potato after we were done.  Yeah, watch this.  This is the real deal, too.  No joke.  We have a potato cannon.  A little potato.  A little hairspray.  We have our outfield with Quinn. 
[00:18:00]  That's my brother Quinn in the outfield with the mitt up in the air.  You hear that fucking deal?  What?  Look how long it's in the air.  Wow.  He's got it?  He's got it?  Oh, man.  You hear that fucking clunk?  Fucking.  A potato hitting him in the chest.  That's got to hurt.  Drops his glove.  Holds his chest.  You're right.  Oof.  It's a big fucking yard. 
[00:18:30]  So we did have a good time before mommy decided to fucking try to wreck everyone's night.  How does a potato gun make a potato gun?  What's the hairspray for?  Oh, man.  I could explain it better than me.  It's flammable.  Yeah.  Are they light it?  Yeah, yeah.  You get a little hole in there and you spray the hairspray in.  And then when you light it, it goes boom in the chamber.  What do you light?  Just a hole?  Just a little hole.  Yeah.  That's just a tough one.  Do you know how many of those most have exploded on people's faces?  Yeah, I'm sure people have had some problems. 
[00:19:00]  Do you think that tube could actually explode?  The PVC?  The PVC.  It would be pretty tough, I think.  It would be tough, but I'm sure it's happened.  Stranger things have happened, yeah.  But then it has to expand, and it shoots that fucking potato.  I mean, I don't know how high.  We counted.  It was in the air six to seven seconds.  Yeah.  And it hit my brother right on the fucking chest.  Ow.  And I hope his wife's not listening today, but he has to go back to the doctor today.  He's in a lot of fucking pain.  Really?  He definitely has a cracked rib, but he's like, I don't know what the fuck's going on. 
[00:19:30]  Cracked rib?  We might have to call Dr. Steve.  Because supposedly, if you take a hit to the chest like that, it could cause your heart to  stop.  Yeah, it could kill him.  Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.  But I don't think he got a direct hit, because it kind of came down on an angle.  Yeah, yeah, on an angle.  And everyone's like, he sucks at catching fly balls.  What's a potato?  It's not exactly a ball.  Yeah, I don't mind the people that are making their jokes.  But then there's idiots.  If a potato goes up in the air, it's not a perfect round object. 
[00:20:00]  So when it starts coming down, it's very unpredictable.  Yeah, yeah.  Nice.  Oh, this was at the tree.  Watch this fucking thing just explode.  And I so want a gun now.  Watch this fucking thing.  You don't even know where the potato goes.  Oh, he's up.  Wow.  That's a cannon.  We couldn't find any piece of the potato on the ground after it hit the tree.  Mashed potato.  We got a gun expert, Jimmy in New Jersey. 
[00:20:30]  Jimmy.  Good morning, guys.  How are you?  All right, buddy.  I built a ton of these things.  They're the most fun you could ever have.  It's just typical redneck fun right here.  Yeah.  We used to use everything for accelerators.  We tried propane.  We tried hairspray.  Hairspray worked the best.  We tried acetylene.  That blew this thing apart.  What's acetylene?  Wait, someone else is saying.  Acetylene.  It's like we're using a torch.  Yeah, Keith is saying we should use acetylene. 
[00:21:00]  Keith, Jimmy's saying no fucking way.  That made it explode.  Well, Jimmy's a retard.  We used it over and over and never had a problem.  My buddy's father was a plumber, so we used to just open up the van and take the torch out.  Right.  And just fill it up with torch.  See, the hairspray gets sticky after a while.  And then when you try to open and close the back of it, it gets glued up.  Right.  Acetylene doesn't do that.  Well, tell Jimmy to scratch his ass.  It's hilarious, though.  My brother looked it up online with his son. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  And he built this thing.  And when it fired the first time, he's like, holy fuck, it works.  It works, yeah.  Wow.  It works.  Those things, man.  Wow.  Yeah.  You can fucking kill somebody with that.  Oh, definitely.  Yeah.  How are they legal?  Dangerous.  Are they legal?  I don't know if they are.  Oh, really?  I don't know if they are legal.  Oh, maybe I should take those videos down there.  That's kind of, yeah, I think it's one of those illegal things that are just tolerated.  We might have.  Until somebody fucks up with one.  We're going to start shooting birds.  A lot of birds out there. 
[00:22:00]  A lot of birds.  And they're starting to flock.  They're starting to get the fuck out of Dodge.  I think it does classify as some type of projectile tossing infernal device.  Is that what happens?  Yeah.  I didn't get a video of it, unfortunately, but my brother missed a lot of fly balls before  the last one hit him on the chest, and that was the end of that game.  But I don't even know why I didn't take a picture of it, but one of the potatoes that  he missed was fucking over halfway buried into his grass. 
[00:22:30]  How high?  And I asked people online, how high did that potato go?  One asshole has to ruin my buzz.  It's only 120 feet.  It's no way it's 120 feet.  No way 120 feet.  It's up in the air for seven seconds.  Unless a bird grabbed it and flew around with it.  It was fucking way too long for 120 feet.  I don't know what the formula is.  I have no idea.  But there's no way it was only 120 feet.  It was between six and seven seconds when he lit it and then hit his chest. 
[00:23:00]  Although 120 feet is almost a 12-story building.  Yeah, but I mean, you've seen baseballs go higher than that, right?  That's pretty high to have something falling in the chest.  I think it was higher.  I really do.  Picture taking a potato and just even softly lobbing it off a 10 or 12-story building.  One guy said, and I appreciate him, he said that my brother took a fastball to the chest  that was about 68 miles an hour.  The guy knew his math on that one.  68 miles an hour to the chest, a potato. 
[00:23:30]  That's got to hurt.  You ever do the potato cat in ant?  No.  Never built one.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Got to love your mom, but how do you not get that old bag out in the field to catch potatoes?  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  It just reminded me of my entire life.  Everything had to be on 10.  Everything. 
[00:24:00]  Fuck.  Everything.  Doesn't sound like a very enjoyable time spent with mom.  At least, you know, I'm old enough to realize she's not going to kill me anymore, so now I just deal with it.  Actually, I don't deal with it.  I just fucking just move to the far side of the basement.  Just walk away.  I don't want my son to have any attachment to that.  Yeah, when kids are putting their heads down and not looking, they're all uncomfortable.  They're all right around teenager age.  The rest of my nephews and nieces, they run the gamut from 13 down to 5, I guess. 
[00:24:30]  They were all like, what the fuck is this?  But it probably makes you all as parents look better.  Everyone thinks their parents are dicks sometimes, so if they see that, they're probably like, oh, all right, well, my mom's doing okay, or my dad's doing okay.  Well, as a father, I know I have to discipline my son, but I can't imagine.  I guess I go the other way.  Supposedly, other people do exactly what their parents did, I guess.  I'm from the school of I can't even imagine doing half the shit my mom did to us. 
[00:25:00]  I can't even imagine it.  I can't fathom it, you know?  So, embarrassing the family and stuff.  Oh, God.  It's exhausting.  It doesn't need to be that way.  It was Thanksgiving.  Fucking chill out.  We'll get you home.  Relax.  I never heard her talk.  I only met her one time at your wedding.  Yeah.  I think there was a hello, but I never heard her talk.  Yeah, she was too busy, already pissed off about what was going on at the wedding, which was nothing, by the way. 
[00:25:30]  There was no problems.  My problem was I decided I didn't want her at the head table because I didn't want to have to fucking babysit her.  Problem.  And she looked at it a different way.  Yes.  Like I didn't want her there, which was technically right, I guess, but I wanted someone else to fucking babysit her so I could maybe enjoy that special day, which is my wedding.  So, I was stupid to do that, I guess.  Fucking Tebow!  You guys don't watch football, but this Tebow is making me believe in God. 
[00:26:00]  They beat the Chargers 16-13.  And Tebow even had a few good passes, Ant.  He's known for his running.  Wow.  He rushed 22 times.  And there's Novak taking a leak on the sidelines, and CBS said, let's take a look at this.  Oh, wow.  What are you doing?  I always wondered, is he a kicker, Novak?  Yeah, Novak fucking.  There was a classic ending to the game.  Novak had a chance to win it, and his attempt was blocked, but the Broncos coach called a timeout just before the kick, so he had a second try at it. 
[00:26:30]  You didn't see any of this?  It was a pretty good day for football yesterday.  Yeah.  Fucking Novak lines up for, I don't know, it was like a 52-yarder.  After he took his little leak on the sideline where CBS is like, fuck, let's keep the shot on him a little longer than normal.  They should be fine for that, right?  You can't have a football player peeing on the sidelines.  I don't know what the ruling is on that one.  Personally, I don't give a fuck, but they seem to have a problem with everything else. 
[00:27:00]  I can't imagine they're going to be happy about that.  So then the field goal is blocked, and also I'm like, holy fuck, this is going over time.  And then they go, oh, a timeout was called.  The stupid Broncos coach was trying to freeze the kicker, they call it.  So he called the timeout just before the snap.  So then the guy had a second shot at it.  You saw all this, right, Travis?  Yeah.  Novak had a second shot, and it went wide right because he doesn't believe in God.  Yeah, well, you know who didn't see that shot go wide right? 
[00:27:30]  Who?  Tim Tebow.  Why?  Because he was praying.  He was?  I'm dead serious.  I swear to God.  He was interviewed after the game.  Let me tell you something.  This whole fucking religious horse shit that he's getting is going to crash in his face  in the playoffs, like a Morton Anderson type thing where he hadn't missed all year, and  then he missed for Minnesota.  A lot of people saying that, but the fact is the Broncos weren't even close to a playoff  contender, and now all of a sudden they're in the hunt for the wild card.  They're 6-5.  They're 5-1 with Tebow as a starter. 
[00:28:00]  5-1.  Yeah.  But Tebow was praying?  Yeah, they asked him after the game, and he said he didn't see it.  He was praying.  The funny thing is-  He may have prayed for a block or a miss.  And he thinks Jesus is helping him out.  Thanks.  Like when he prays for something like that.  Yeah, but 60 minutes-  He's won four in a row.  60 minutes blew up his spot because that was a really exciting football game, and a lot  of us, you know, you keep the channel on, I guess, old school, and all of a sudden  60 minutes comes on, and they have this deeply depressing story. 
[00:28:30]  About 16 million kids are homeless in America.  And they're living in, like, U-Haul trucks and cars.  And I'm like, fuck, I guess God doesn't believe in these children, but he lives in Tebow.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's helping Tebow out.  But it blew up his spot because that's what came on right after the game.  You went from, holy fuck, that was a lot of fun, to holy shit, this is depressing as hell.  And I tweeted that, and then some asshole fucking said, just watch it. 
[00:29:00]  You're privileged, and you should watch these kids.  Why?  Why are people such douchebags?  They're just idiots.  People are douchebags.  I wasn't going for a joke or anything.  I was just going for an observation, like, wow, I guess God, you know, believes in football  more than, you know, homeless children.  This is deeply depressing, something like that.  And the guy has to call me out, and I'm like, dude, you're privileged, you should watch this. 
[00:29:30]  Maybe you'll learn something.  Fucking assholes.  They're the worst.  What are you doing?  Fucking assholes.  Twitter sucks.  I was just reading through some tweets and tweeting about all kinds of things.  Occupy Wall Street and how that's dead.  Yeah.  That's dead on arrival now.  Yeah.  And then you get the people that are still just trying to pull for it, and they got to,  you know, call you names. 
[00:30:00]  It's just like, okay, shut up.  It's done-ski.  You think the movement's done?  Yeah.  I think the occupying part is done, but I think this will allow it to reorganize into something  maybe more respectable.  You think?  I don't.  I don't think there's any energy or, there's nobody that wants anything more than the occupy  part.  Well, I mean, you know, having those people occupying your parks wasn't good for the movement  because it was bringing in the homeless and the convicts and the people that aren't right 
[00:30:30]  in the head, you know?  So where are they going to go?  I don't know.  It'll be interesting to see what happens next.  I think it just, it's what it's doing.  It's fizzling out.  You think it's just fizzling away?  They've got plenty of money.  Yeah, yeah.  They've got money.  Well, the one guy's enjoying his luxury.  They've got over a million dollars, right?  I mean, they had close to a million like a month ago.  They have to.  Jesus.  Yeah, that's...  Well, they're not leaving L.A.  They had the ultimatum, right?  They were supposed to be out of L.A. at midnight? 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  It's now, what, almost four in the morning in L.A.?  Yeah, they're giving them a little more time to get the fuck out of there.  And Philly formed a human chain.  Really?  They're supposed to be out of the City Hall area?  Human chain.  Yeah.  Well, Philly's a...  Daisy chain.  Philly's a special situation, too, because they want to start construction down there.  Around City Hall.  So they're like, you guys got to get the fuck out of here.  We're going to be constructing some shit around here.  But they let them stay.  But now they're supposed to leave, too.  Just got to throw them the fuck out. 
[00:31:30]  You've had it.  It's just, it's a goof now.  Yeah.  Somebody was like, well, if, you know...  If you're so pissed about it, why so upset about it?  You're talking about it all the time.  I'm like, I'm talking about it.  It was in the news.  I'm goofing on the fact that it's nothing now.  It's been pretty much pulled apart by local government agencies.  Yeah.  Who cares? 
[00:32:00]  Done.  Well, I mean, winter's hitting, so...  I think, yeah, you got to wait until spring to see if there's anything left in this.  Oh, spring.  They'll try in the spring to revitalize it, but I don't see it happening.  Rumor has it Washington's going to be the big place.  Oh, is it?  A lot of people are going to be focusing on Washington.  No one protests there.  My Cowboys won, by the way.  Oh, you're...  Now that I think they're leading the division...  First place in the division, yeah.  Aren't they 7-4?  Yes, they are.  Yeah, first place. 
[00:32:30]  They beat the Dolphins, though.  Yeah, Miami.  Last minute...  Your team.  Yeah, it was 1917, I think, and they...  Or 2019.  Oh, you mean...  Oh, you're right.  Before Vogel, yeah.  And then they kicked the old three-pointer.  Did Romo have a good game?  Did you even watch, Jimmy?  I was over...  I went to Gnome's with Bob and his wife, because Bob had his kitchen fix, so Gnome from the  cellar, people to his house.  Yeah.  So we're watching...  This is how I know I've changed.  Wait, you went there just to check out a new kitchen? 
[00:33:00]  No, no, no.  Bobby doesn't have a kitchen.  Like, he couldn't cook.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  So I went and...  He was saying that when we were playing Call of Duty.  He's like, yeah, I'm getting a kitchen.  I go, why do you need two?  One for him and one for his wife.  He didn't appreciate it.  She wants healthy food.  So we went over there, and it was fun.  We ate, and then the game is on, and I'm watching it, and then Ava was there, and she wanted  to put on The Godfather for her niece, and I'm sure if I would have asked for the game  to stay on, they would have left it on, but I didn't even think about it. 
[00:33:30]  They turned off football for The Godfather?  I didn't care.  I was like, good.  Wow.  Yeah.  It shows you how little I care about football anymore.  Didn't we have one TV?  Oh, no.  We could have done something.  Oh, my God.  You don't turn off a good football game.  I know.  I didn't even notice.  I don't even really care about the Broncos, but I watched the second half of that game.  It was a fun one.  The Cowboys beat the Dolphins 2019.  I got to say, I got killed on Twitter because the Jets defeated the Bills, and I was bragging  a little bit.  You know, I know.  The Bills were weakened.  They were a weakened team this Sunday. 
[00:34:00]  All right, I'll admit it.  Is that what happened?  And Sanchez almost looked good.  He had four TDs, but he still fucking just isn't the man that we were all hoping he would  be.  What do you think of this?  First Jets quarterback to throw four touchdowns since Brett Favre.  Yes, I know that.  Favre.  Favre.  What do you think of the touchdown celebration?  That was great.  I thought it was awesome.  Hilarious.  I'm a Jets fan, and I thought it was hilarious what Stevie Johnson did.  And we're watching MSNBC before the show.  I don't know the guy's name.  He's on for like a half hour before the morning, Joe. 
[00:34:30]  He calls it the dumbest touchdown celebration ever.  I'm like, are you a man?  That was a good one.  No man would say it's the dumbest touchdown celebration ever.  It's hilarious, and he's goofing.  He does the little six-shooter thing, like, pew, pew, and then he puts the fake handgun  by his leg and makes like he shot himself in the leg.  Yeah.  Like Plaxico, and then he puts his arms out like a jet plane, and he runs a little bit  and then crashes.  Right.  It was great. 
[00:35:00]  You know who didn't like it?  Who?  Bob Costas.  Ah, what did Bob Costas say?  Bob Costas had his little halftime thing.  He's very true.  And what did he say?  He, uh, well, he made some good points.  You know, I like Bob.  Are you kidding?  No, I'm not kidding at all.  What were the good points?  That, you know, players get fined by their coaches and stuff for, you know, blowing assignments  and blowing plays.  And, you know, Stevie Johnson does this.  He costs them, you know, X amount of yards at kickoff.  And the Jets, you know, with a shortened field, scored on the next drive. 
[00:35:30]  And he's not going to get fined by the coaches, you know?  It was dumb on his part because, yeah, they ended up giving the Bills a 15-yard penalty,  which led to the Jets scoring.  So, in the end, it was really dumb on his part.  But it's great for the game to let these guys get stupid.  Yeah, people enjoy it.  Why not?  He made some good points.  And Stevie Johnson, I'm sure something will happen to him, whether the NFL finds him or the team.  Yeah, he'll probably get fined. 
[00:36:00]  Of course he will.  But everyone knows who Stevie Johnson is today.  Can I see the celebration?  I haven't seen it.  Oh, it's hilarious.  I fucking howled.  I fucking howled.  But I guess if you're a Jets fan, you're not supposed to howl.  Are you kidding me?  You're about to see the best touchdown celebration.  You don't need my commentary.  I was just going to say, that guy sounds like you.  Yeah.  Because I thought, so Stevie Johnson scores, he gets up, he's dancing, shoots himself in  the leg, a la Plaxico Burris.  And then he fucking flies like Holmes does for the Jets. 
[00:36:30]  And then he falls down and crashes.  That's just silly.  Why can't you do that?  It's great.  Everyone was talking about this yesterday.  Because you're not allowed to have any fun after you score a touchdown.  Yeah, it really is.  And they lost anyway.  But to the guy on MSNBC, I don't know your name.  You're not a man if you call it the dumbest.  It's fucking great.  I love this shit.  Who doesn't love this shit when it happens?  Do you love this shit?  I like when things are a little off, a little odd.  Yes, of course.  Who won last night? 
[00:37:00]  Was it Steelers win?  Yeah.  13-9.  13-9.  Yeah.  What the fuck is that?  It's the Costas thing if you want to.  Oh, you want to hear it?  It's Bob Costas.  Is it short?  Yeah, it's like two minutes.  In a culture that in many ways grows more stupid and graceless by the moment.  Sports both reflects and influences that trend.  Pause.  Playing fields everywhere.  Pause.  Gets stupider by the moment or whatever the fuck he said.  And graceless.  Does anyone remember old school football when all this was happening all the time? 
[00:37:30]  It doesn't happen much anymore.  There used to be sack.  The sack dance.  The sack dance.  Everyone had a touchdown fucking celebration dance.  Somewhere extremely obnoxious.  He goes through the history.  You know who cracked down on that?  It was Tom Landry.  I want to say it was Drew Hill.  I could be making the receiver roll.  He beat him with his hat.  Yes, he did.  And he made him wear it on the field.  It was a black man wearing an old white man fedora.  He was humiliated.  And he would suck his weenie every time he did that.  And that made Drew Hill stop immediately.  But I was so mad that Tom Landry did that. 
[00:38:00]  I'm like, why can't they fucking...  I thought it was spiking the ball back in the 70s or 80s.  What's wrong with spiking the ball?  The old spike.  No, Tom Landry didn't even like spiking of the ball.  No.  Wow.  I didn't know that, Jimmy.  I could be wrong with Drew Hill.  I forget who it was.  But I just remember that he was like a fucking law and order douchebag.  The thing about Bob Costas, which is creepy, the guy hasn't aged him 20 years.  Yeah.  It's really fucking creepy.  Had a wig or is that his hair?  I think he just dyes it.  But he must have had face work, but you can't tell. 
[00:38:30]  His face isn't looking like Scott Shannon or anything.  He looks exactly the same as he did 20 years ago.  That's fucking creepy.  But if he's starting to think this shit, then he's got to step aside and let someone else come in.  Because this shit rules.  What does he...  I got to go with what else he says about this.  Pause right now.  Wouldn't it be great if he goes...  And as most of us know, blacks are the ones doing this.  So it's what I've said before.  Segregate the league.  You have white teams that play. 
[00:39:00]  As they're ushering him off.  Some guy with a headset just pulls him off the camera.  You got to respect the black man's rhythm, though.  The white guy in the end zone, it's always awkward.  Tries to find a place to spike in.  It usually pops back up and hits him in the face or something.  White guys just run around in a circle with their arms flailing.  You don't know if they're happy if our building's on fire.  Yeah, the black guys kind of make it...  Oh, yeah.  The black guys make it fun.  Go ahead.  By the moment, sports both reflects and influences that trend. 
[00:39:30]  So on playing fields everywhere, true style is in decline, while mindless exhibitionism abounds.  In the late 60s, the Giants had a receiver named Homer Jones.  He invented the spike, and it was great.  A simple, elegant punctuation that somehow has devolved into this.  Given the tone of the times, it's probably too much to expect that most players would appreciate that back in the day, this guy was much cooler than this guy. 
[00:40:00]  Sanders and Gastineau.  Spontaneous and or good-natured displays of enthusiasm.  Guys jumping into the stands.  Calculated displays of obnoxious self-indulgence.  The fake sword fight.  The fake sword fight has already gone so far down the wrong track, there's probably no turning back.  So our suggestion here is a more modest one.  Hey, knuckleheads, is it too much to ask that you confine your buffoonery to situations that don't directly damage your team?  Week after week, game after game, we see guys who think nothing of incurring penalties for unsportsmanlike conduct, 
[00:40:30]  costing their team's valuable yardage, even late in close games.  Today's most conspicuous culprit, Buffalo's Stevie Johnson, who after a TD catch versus the Jets,  thought it would be a good idea to go Marcel Marceau, pantomiming among other things,  Plexico Burris shooting himself in the leg.  But in this case, it was Johnson who shot himself in the foot,  as his display cost his team a 15-yard penalty on the ensuing kickoff.  And given a short field, the Jets proceeded to score in a critical game that wound up 28-24. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, it fucked up the whole game for the Bills.  Which raises this question.  Where are the coaches in all this?  Guys who are routinely benched or called out for blown assignments.  When is a coach going to make an overdue statement  and sit a guy down on the grounds of pure selfishness and unprofessionalism detrimental to his team?  By the way, late in the loss to the Jets, Johnson dropped a pass that could have led to a Buffalo win.  Shockingly, he didn't follow it with a rehearsed, my bad, dance of apology. 
[00:41:30]  Maybe he just ran.  After the second half from Kansas City.  He makes a great rehearsed, my bad.  He's becoming a fuddy-duddy, though.  Of course the coaches should do something if it's costing your team yardage,  but in general, relax, Bob.  Yeah, look, like I said, I don't think he's against, you know, celebrations,  but when you're being selfish and you're costing your team.  Hey, keep him classy. Keep him classy.  I like the little spike.  And you know what's funny?  Emmett Smith in his book was saying that he never did that.  He goes, because he used to. 
[00:42:00]  I think his dad or somebody said, when you just run in and you spike it,  guys that have been there before don't do that.  You look like you belong there when you just drop the ball.  So Emmett never did shit like that.  But a spike is just like a punctuation.  I can't believe that guy invented it.  Like, no one figured that out before that.  Yes, I'm going to invent something.  Watch this.  Right.  Thwock.  Jake LaMotta did that in the 40s with his wife's face in the football.  It's hilarious, though.  Yeah.  The team got penalized.  Now the coaches should get involved, of course. 
[00:42:30]  You know, but.  That's silly.  I don't know.  I just.  Kostas is just overdramatic.  Love Kostas.  He raised a good point, though.  He must have had that pre-written and just used it because there's no way he improvised  that.  That was too good.  He just goes through his files.  Let me see.  I wrote something about this seven years ago.  Yeah.  Here's what I get.  Some dramatic music and a sunrise coming up over a field or something that I could read  this over.  You overdramatic asshole.  God, just fucking start the game.  I don't need the Bob Kostas fucking vignette. 
[00:43:00]  Someone should do a video on Bob Kostas and his ridiculous vignettes.  Vignette.  Vignettes.  Vignettes.  Man.  I spent most of the weekend not watching anything except Xbox Live.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Playing Call of Duty until Danny came over and we were going to do like a real nerdy kind  of a LAN thing where he's playing downstairs on an Xbox and I'm playing upstairs on the 
[00:43:30]  Xbox upstairs and would go online and multiplayer and things like that.  And when he flipped on the Xbox downstairs, my router about took a shit and freaked out.  Why?  Because apparently when you put two Xboxes in the same house through one router, all hell  breaks loose.  I was trying without success to get my fucking Xbox back online.  It will not go. 
[00:44:00]  I have no idea.  It will not go to Xbox Live now.  Xbox doesn't want two different...  No, I think the router was fucked up.  Look, if I knew what it was, I'd have fixed it.  Sure.  I don't know what the fuck it is.  It works wirelessly.  When I have my Xbox wirelessly, it picks up the network and I get on.  And when I hook it up with an Ethernet cable, it doesn't even identify.  It doesn't know.  It won't get me onto Xbox Live.  Why?  Does it not see your connection?  Yeah, it doesn't see it. 
[00:44:30]  Is it the Xbox or your Ethernet?  Exactly.  You don't know?  I have no idea why that is.  I need something, someone to fix it.  Yeah, it takes a shitload of bandwidth.  I do understand.  But after everything's taken care of now, the other Xbox is shut off.  The one downstairs, I'm just trying to play on the one I have been playing on.  And it still will not do it.  It did something.  It did something bad.  I think it identified you as a problem because of the bandwidth and now the internet company  will let you on?  I don't know.  I really don't know. 
[00:45:00]  I went online, and this is the second part of it.  I went online to try to find out what the problem was and fix it.  Because, you know, you get on a computer and you fix anything just by punching in what  the problem is.  Somebody, by the way, you're punching, like, how do you do this?  And then some other asshole has asked the exact same question.  Yes.  And there's a forum answer for it.  Yeah, that's what I was doing.  And that lasted for about ten minutes.  And somehow, by searching for the Xbox and the fact that the router won't work, I ended 
[00:45:30]  up for three hours watching Girls Giving Handjobs.  I ended up on the handjob fucking.  It's so fascinating to watch.  So underrated, right?  Three hours.  I watched nothing but handjobs.  The hard pounding ones.  The ones where she barely touches with the thumb.  And there's cum going all over the place. 
[00:46:00]  And then I noticed a few things, too.  Girls find it very funny when guys cum, when they give them a handjob.  Girls will laugh.  They'll be jerking and they're like, all right.  And then when the guy starts shooting, they're like, oh!  And if there's more than one girl there, they look at each other, oh, look, yes!  They love it!  I'm not a fan of laughing during sex.  No.  I know.  I fucking hate that shit.  That got me.  And also the girls that go like, oh. 
[00:46:30]  Let's keep it dirty, ladies.  Let's keep it dirty.  And also the girls that go, oh, good boy.  Good boy.  Well, that's...  That's...  Oh, you like that?  Not so bad, Ant.  Not so bad.  Be a good boy.  Not so bad.  Good boy is okay.  I also noticed that Asian ladies that I was watching on these videos, I don't know what  the whole deal is with the Asian ladies.  No emotion as a jerk?  Well, they don't up until...  I think they thought... 
[00:47:00]  I don't know what they thought.  Maybe streamers were going to come out or something?  Because they are so surprised when cum shoots out of this fucking thing.  They like...  They wince.  You know what's coming out of it.  They wince.  Like, what the fuck was that?  That's hilarious.  But some women, very proficient at the art of the handy.  Why are they...  Why are they cubing out the dick?  That's some Asian fucking thing.  Asian porn is horrible, dude.  You can't find an Asian handjob like that. 
[00:47:30]  Asian porn is fucking terrible.  But Sam, that's a...  It's pixelated.  It's terrible.  Why are they pixelating the penis?  They're just so fucking weird.  Everything else you can see.  Asian porn is horrible, dude.  That's so bizarre.  They'll sell fucking young girls' panties in vending machines.  Right.  But God forbid you don't pixel out the genitalia.  Yeah.  It's terrible.  Yeah.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Who gives the best handjumps?  You know what's odd? 
[00:48:00]  You almost got to give this one to the older broads.  Oh, yeah.  Like, from watching these videos...  They try harder.  They just know the whole deal.  I was watching these compilations of handies where it's just, you know, pretty much three,  four strokes and then the cum flies.  And you really get a feel for who knows what they're doing.  Those dungeon women?  Boy, are they good.  They got these fucking guys.  They were arcing fucking shots that looked like artillery. 
[00:48:30]  It is funny to see.  A good handjob can be really sexy.  A handy.  And then, you know, where the girl wants to put the cum.  And then these girls that make it...  You know, you're not fooling anybody when you open your mouth and start jerking, waiting  to get the cum, and then they turn their head at the last minute and go, mmm.  Mmm.  No, not mmm.  You don't like this.  You know what's sexy with a handjob is when they just start, the sounds of it. 
[00:49:00]  It's like...  Because it sounds so wet and, like, it feels so good.  Like, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.  It just looks like such a great place to be.  Look at her.  She's barely touching.  She's milking that.  What a pro.  That's a pro, and she's like an older broad, I bet.  She's milking that.  Yeah.  Oh, look.  There's just two of the girls just rubbing it with their fingers.  Wow.  But he...  Oh, see, he's tied up.  He's one of the fetish guys.  He's a fetish guy.  He's wrapped in plastic wrap.  Yeah.  What did mommy do to you?  Oh, man. 
[00:49:30]  What the fuck?  Don't you envy that, though?  Don't you wish you could cum that easy?  I would love that.  Look at that.  They were barely stroking their fingers up and down the bottom of his shaft, and he fucking unloads.  Wow.  He probably comes in his pants a lot.  I bet.  Woo.  Jesus.  Hello there.  Fire.  Wow.  This girl's milking it onto a camera lens.  Check your fire.  Check your fire.  I thought our potato cannon was impressive.  Yeah.  Wow.  Could you move the thumb, Sam?  Oh, wow.  The fucking little window's hand is right in front of the girl's chin.  Oh, Sam. 
[00:50:00]  She's taking it right on the face.  Oh, boy.  That girl's mouth is open.  She's just doing a wacky free-for-all kind of.  Yeah.  Those are those two where the girl's jerking and the dick is going all over the place and  the cum's flying like a sprinkler.  And then there's the ones that know how to just arc it.  Oh, I wish we saw the rest of that last one because she looked like she was not happy.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  That looked like Kennedy's headshot.  It's just flying.  Yeah.  So I never got to fix my Xbox. 
[00:50:30]  I don't blame you.  I ended up just watching it.  But you would have broken your TV if you didn't find handjobs.  Well, exactly.  I needed a distraction.  It gives a fuck about Call of Duty at this point.  Yeah.  It's something about watching porn, too, where you're just like, wow, three hours has gone  by already.  It's just fucking crazy how fast the time goes when you're watching smut.  Did you whack your bag?  You know.  Okay.  I might have.  You know.  I might have arced one.  I might have had to take care of business. 
[00:51:00]  Jesus Christ.  Handjobs.  You know what?  Yeah.  It's like, you know, I just became a fan of handjobs.  Girls taking it out right on the face, in the mouth, on the tits.  What are you going to do?  You know, I thought of you yesterday.  Oh, Jimmy.  Honestly, I was thinking of you watching these.  We got a love connection.  I have been watching, and I never liked interracial porn.  I never liked it.  Oh, well, I still don't.  But it's like, literally, it's my new thing. 
[00:51:30]  It'll go away.  But I've been watching it.  I hope so.  I found one of the fucking hottest clips I've ever seen.  It was an interracial porn thing with the husband.  I like ones where the husband films it.  Oh, no.  I don't want to see the husband.  I just want to see them filming it.  And the guy is banging the chicken.  She's calling him, sir.  And it was so fucking dirty.  Really?  Oh, man.  You find one of those clips where you just...  I actually put it in my favorites.  Because I couldn't find it one day, and I fucking spent two hours looking for it.  You find a good porn clip, man?  Fuck.  That'll get you through some hard times. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, dude.  It's one of my favorite clips ever.  It's so dirty.  And then I was also checking out some chicks that were just like regular girls laying on  their bed at their house and just fucking masturbating with shit.  That was pretty cool, too.  Really?  No fucking nothing.  Just girls fucking getting off.  And I don't want music.  I don't want cameras moving.  I don't like that.  I want the camera on the bed, the chick where you can hear her moaning and getting off. 
[00:52:30]  That's it.  That's the music or a guy going, yeah, you do that.  No.  You don't want it to look like a production.  I'm very particular.  When I click on it and I see it's a production thing, I'm like, no.  I want a chick that just decided to set up a camera and fucking get herself off on  the bed.  Holy shit.  What website is this?  This has got to be like, what?  One of those porn tube things.  BangUlater.com? 
[00:53:00]  BangUlater?  She's going to get a face full.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, jeez.  Bob Kelly, by the way, ruined my life with that Clitty website.  Clitty.  It's the fucking best site on it.  There's thousands of videos on that for every fetish.  Holy shit.  Clitty.  Bob, I wish I'd never seen that because literally you're going to a subcategory and that's spelled  C-L-I-T-I, I think.  The porn industry is fucked, huh?  You're in trouble, dude.  It's all through ads from these free things.  That's tough for the ladies. 
[00:53:30]  The professionals.  And then another thing I noticed, because I hadn't really perused internet porn in a while,  you know, with any, you know, zeal.  So, what I'm noticing, though, is a lot of pop-behind ads and things, and these phony  chat girls, where it's like, you're looking at something, and then out of nowhere, like,  I'm hearing this voice going,  Yeah, so, yeah, give it to me.  What are you, um, that's good. 
[00:54:00]  Where, where, where are you from?  I'm like, what the fuck is this?  You're looking around your screen, where is this coming from?  And then I realize behind my browser that I've been looking at, there's 80 fucking, fucking  windows open.  They're all yapping about something.  They're, they're these chat rooms that are fake.  They're just pre-taped bullshit.  I got into a fucking fight with my ex about that, because I was trying to quit watching  porn, and I was on one of these websites that shows violent videos, and I was not looking  at the porn. 
[00:54:30]  But when you go on that site, it will open those little chat windows.  So I'm watching it, and you hear, like, um, oh, yeah, just call me later, and she comes  to the kitchen, she's like, what do you watch?  You're quitting.  I'm like, no, I'm watching this beheading.  They got a whole fucking fight about this.  You get in trouble.  Well, no, he brings up a good point, because you're talking about the porn sites, but they're  starting to throw those ads on sites that are edgy, but not porn sites.  So all of a sudden, you're trying to check out some fucking, you know, cool, edgy video.  Next thing you know, there's a girl trying to, you know, get you to call their service 
[00:55:00]  or whatever.  Yeah.  I don't, I'm trying to remember what sites have it, but it's happened to a lot of people.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's, uh, there's, I like the ones, the chat window pop up, and it says that the  girl is from the town you're from.  Yeah.  From your town.  That's, it's like, yeah, it's like two miles away from her right now, and look what she's  doing.  And then you hear, it's like, why don't you give me a call?  What?  Because you're recording.  Shut up.  Have you had the, have anyone been on instant messenger in the last like six months where  you have a fucking bot, a fake person, cause I've had the same IM name for years, and you'll 
[00:55:30]  get a fucking bot contact you, a robot, and like, hey, what are you doing?  And I know I don't know the person, and I'm like, you're a bot, you're not real.  But then it will respond, I'm not a bot.  Whoa.  It's like, they know how to respond.  But you, and as soon as you respond, that puts you on a whole nother level of other shit  they're going to throw at you.  Well, I want, you wind up blocking them, and they, uh, but then I'll start writing really  racist shit, or about rape, and then they'll just respond, so what are you up to?  I'm like, no real girl would respond that way. 
[00:56:00]  Like when the telemarketers call your cell phone, I, I, I used to like answer and just yell  and scream at these fucking idiots, but now someone taught me, you answer that fucking  phone, that puts you on a whole nother level of shit that they're going to  throw at you.  Yeah.  Oh, that's hilarious, Ant.  Hand jobs.  Yeah, yeah, hand job videos, and, uh, masturbating, um, nice.  Girls on the bed videos.  And I like, I don't like them to look polished or anything.  I don't like the porn star looking girl.  I like a girl that's like, maybe a little sloppy.  I completely agree with you. 
[00:56:30]  And she, but she's getting off so much, and it's real, you know?  Yes, yes.  That's the deal.  I completely agree.  A German woman I saw give a hand job one time, where the guy gets on his hands and knees,  and she's just milking his neck.  Oh, like behind, between his legs.  Dude, milking it, and she was fingering his ass.  Milking it.  She was milking his dick, and she put a finger in his, I'm like, oh my God.  And I'm not even big on fingers in my ass, but I'm like, that looks like it feels amazing.  Did you fall in love with her?  Fuck yeah.  She had a bunch of, she was one of those, uh, just, that was her thing. 
[00:57:00]  She gave hand jobs.  And I like when they give it a hand job, but you don't think they're going to suck it, and  then they do?  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, oh, that's so nice.  There was a, uh, there was a blowjob video that was, uh, pretty amazing.  This, uh, this chick has gone down on this guy.  He's got a pretty ample dick on him.  And, uh, and, uh, she's doing a bang-up job.  And you could tell he's ready to cum, and it wasn't a cum shot in the face.  She buried her mouth down in his balls, and, and, like, squeezed him, and, and you hear 
[00:57:30]  her go, like, like, he shot a fucking load in her mouth, where, when he's done, she, she  pulls it out and goes, like, like, like, like, she just came up for air from, from, from  a diving accident.  It was, it was astounding.  Yeah, that's what happened when my Xbox broke, by the way.  The second my Xbox broke, porno!  Everything leads to porn.  Uh, I do have to fix that, though. 
[00:58:00]  Fix that router.  Very good.  Well.  Yeah.  Why don't we, uh, why don't we take our first break?  Yes.  We got Dr. J coming in today.  Holy fuck, man.  Yeah.  Ooh.  He's pointing at charity, I think, right?  Or was it an auction at charity?  Damn.  He's legendary.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We'll talk to him, and also, uh, Bernie Fine.  Holy fuck, we got the audio.  Don't you worry.  Yes.  Is he coming in?  I'd love to talk to Bernie Fine.  Bernie Fine is...  Speaking of hand jobs, that's what he did.  He just jerked them off in the car, allegedly.  I diddle the children.  What age did, what age should you know better when, like, an older dude is touching you? 
[00:58:30]  Because some of these guys coming out, it's like, how old were you at?  Ask Florentine.  He pretty much knew it wasn't right, but he wanted those wrestling pictures.  But I think he did it to college guys, right?  This one guy's alleging that he did it from the time he was seven until he was 27.  Wow.  27?  Yeah.  He probably couldn't come anymore unless fucking William Frawley was sitting next to him.  Fucked him up sexually.  I was listening to 1010 Winds, and a guy's going, yeah, I'd be watching movies, and he put 
[00:59:00]  my, uh, put his hand in my pants.  Yeah, yeah.  That would happen one time with me.  Watching TV.  One fucking time.  I thought it was the remote control.  I was changing the channels by touching his ball stack.  Ah!  Certainly!  Oh, boy.  Another boy to diddle in the asshole.  I hate getting blood on my couch.  Could you wear this diaper? 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, he was jerking kids off, I guess.  Yeah.  Down there, and the wife, uh, the wife knew some shit was going on because it was a recording  of her.  Oh, yeah, we're going to have the audio next.  She, she fucking threw him under the bus, and Bernie Fine is no longer with the Syracuse  program.  Yeah.  They fired him, what, yesterday?  Finally got rid of him.  Fucking creep.  Yeah, that's just, uh, that's just creepy.  Come on.  I was thinking about this, man.  I mean, I think you go into a, a profession where, you know, I don't think every coach is 
[01:00:00]  like this, but if, if you're into kids and stuff, you're going to look at the coaching  profession.  Why would you give up your spare time to be with kids?  Right.  I don't want to make a blanket statement, because there are a lot of, you know, coaches doing  the right thing and stuff, but it also, it's also an environment for fucking pedos, man.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that, that scout leaders, things like that, it's just seems like, oh, I think, I  really think if you're a foot doctor, you're, you're, you're into a, you're into feet. 
[01:00:30]  You have a foot fetish.  I would say 99% of foot doctors really get off on feet.  That's weird.  Why else would you go into that profession?  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Why?  Yeah, you could be another doctor and, you know, make a lot of, a lot more money.  Asshole doctor?  Well, I think they're, they're into assholes.  Why would you, why?  Unless that was your thing.  Why would you go into that?  Why would you go through medical school so you could look at assholes all day unless  that was your thing? 
[01:01:00]  I was watching this girl.  She had two fingers up her pussy and she would go like that and her pinky would go in her  ass at the same time.  The shocker.  Yeah, but she did it to herself.  Like, dude, the shocker.  Like, that's how she got herself off.  It's amazing.  That's pretty, I'd like to see that.  Oh, I saw so much smut.  Well, let's, uh.  I'm smutted out.  Let's take a break.  We'll, uh, do the Bernie Fine audio.  Newt Gingrich is, uh, wow.  Making a run for it, huh?  Yeah, he's the, you know, the guy they're going for now. 
[01:01:30]  We'll see what happens.  Miley Cyrus is a pothead.  And what was that picture of her?  Was that real?  I don't know.  Topless?  I got it from my pal, uh, I like Girls Daily.  Yeah, I saw that one.  It's fake.  People say it's fake, but how do you know it's fake?  It was a great picture.  It was a great picture.  Yeah.  You think it was fake?  I don't know.  I like to think it was real.  My feedback was about, uh, 50-50.  Was it a photo?  Yeah.  Because they're saying she has a tattoo that's not in that picture.  Oh!  Did you see it? 
[01:02:00]  If it's not fake, she's got some, she's got some problems with her, with her titties.  They're like, uh.  They're sagging a little too much for a 19-year-old.  A little tube-like.  Huh?  They're a little cone-like.  Almost banana-like.  And banana, yeah, those banana, nanner tits.  You got them nanner tits.  Nanner tits.  Nanner tits.  Nanner tits.  Is there anything more depressing when, when you're, like, turned on by a girl and you  bring her home and she has shitty tits?  The bra can make up for a world of hurt. 
[01:02:30]  Just shitty tits.  Shitty titty.  Like the banana ones.  Yeah, yeah.  Fucking, they don't have to be fucking knockers, over-the-top knockers.  No, no.  It has nothing to do with size.  It just has to do with the, yeah, the shape of them.  Oh, my God.  Where, or most of it's, like, the fucking nipple and areola.  Oh, the chewed-out gravy, gravy-stained tits.  No, I like those.  Those are the ones I like.  Where it's more that than breast meat?  Yeah, I like when it's more that than her.  What do we call those? 
[01:03:00]  Moose noses?  Moose noses.  Black women are cursed with, like, I think at 14 their tits start sagging.  What the fuck is going on there?  They, you rarely see a nipple that is north of the equator.  Yeah.  Usually they're down, uh, which one is that?  Tropic of Cancer?  Down there?  Or Capricorn.  Capricorn is the one.  We can't find the Miley Cyrus topless pick.  I don't know what it is.  I didn't tweet that much.  It should be in my timeline. 
[01:03:30]  They've got four kids by 17.  Oh, boy.  Of course, the racist remarks start coming in.  Oh, boy.  Uh, well, what are you going to do?  Uh, Mark is a foot doctor.  Oh.  I said 99%.  Is he the 1% man?  You're the 1%, Mark.  I'm the 99% that do not have foot fetishes.  Trust me.  You don't want to be looking at these feet we're looking at open.  Then why would you go into that?  It's an amazing profession, believe it or not.  Amazing.  One makes it amazing.  Brain surgery. 
[01:04:00]  It's amazing.  Cardiology.  Amazing.  When you can take a heart out of a guy's chest, put it on a table for a while, do some  shit, and put it back in his chest, that's amazing.  That's amazing.  You, uh, you know, taking care of some cuticles.  Right.  Ask Jimmy about his orthotics.  And working on a hammer toe every once in a while.  Who cares?  Stop.  You deal with stuff that is never life or death.  They never call in a podiatrist for life or death situations.  Nothing wrong with that. 
[01:04:30]  Let me see, Sam.  I can see.  I agree.  See, she's still.  The face looks.  She's absolutely still on the radar.  You know, and those boobs are nice.  We're looking at the Miley Cyrus top.  Yeah, I think the face is.  It looks lighter in color.  And something's going on in that lower left quadrant of her chin and cheek.  Yeah, it does look fake.  Yeah.  Although it's too bad because those tits are fucking phenomenal.  You like those?  I like those.  They're teardrop bananas.  They're like ski slopes.  Yeah.  But they're moving downwards a little too much for a 19-year-old.  You're right.  But it still looks like it's a Photoshop. 
[01:05:00]  Fuck it, man.  It was still fun to check out.  Like, what would she do when she's just standing there with her top off?  I don't know.  You see right where the chin meets the neck, it really does look like it was like face-off.  Yeah.  When they put the face on.  It's a different color, different skin tone, it looks like.  Yeah.  Something's going on there.  Well, we lost foot doctor guy.  It's fake.  Well, he was getting back to his amazing medical practice.  Yeah, I mean, you know, he might be one of the legit ones, but I'm suspicious of asshole 
[01:05:30]  doctors and foot doctors.  Hammer toes.  Why would you want to look at assholes all day?  Corns.  Unless that was your thing.  My favorite part of this photo, by the way, is fucking Cavs McGillicuddy on the fucking  sofa behind her.  I know.  What the fuck is going on there?  Some lady's mounting the sofa to do something.  I don't know what.  Yeah, that should tell you right there it's fake.  Like, what would she be doing there with some woman, tranny, whatever it is?  Vomiting over the fucking back of the sofa?  Yeah, that picture is suspect. 
[01:06:00]  Well, it gives you the idea of what it might look like, though, which is always cool.  Yeah, it's definitely a picture from a strip club.  Also over the weekend, a little upskirt of Selena Gomez.  Oh, yeah?  And that one's real.  Really?  Coming down the stairs and...  You see any, ah, puss-a.  No, just like, she's got, what color was it, like, aqua bluish panties on.  Oh, well, what have we got here?  Well, well.  Well.  Oh, hi, Selena.  There you go.  That's nice.  Oh, yeah.  A little upskirt, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Who's got that? 
[01:06:30]  Justin Bieber's got that.  What would Tyler Durden do have it?  Yeah, it's from...  www.tdd.com is a great site for some of this shit.  By the way, the Biebs coming into the city, I guess, on Wednesday, huh?  He's been in.  Oh, has he?  He's supposed to be at the Christmas tree lighting, and Obama's going to be in town,  and the Christmas tree's getting lit.  So let's take the day off.  Have fun on Wednesday, everybody.  Let's take the day off.  Have fun.  I think we deserve a day off.  I don't disagree. 
[01:07:00]  That's hilarious.  Did you watch Bieber on the Today Show?  I had to watch.  No.  The curiosity gets the best of me.  I'm like, what is this about?  I know I'm way too old for this shit, but I don't get it.  He doesn't seem that talented.  He's not that talented.  He doesn't suck, obviously, but it's like, why are they losing their fucking minds?  He was like some kind of a protégé when he was a kid, but now that he's older, it's  just like, oh, yeah.  A protégé?  Protégé.  Protégé.  He was somebody's protégé.  He sings like an angel. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  A protégé.  What do I know?  These assholes at the Today Show did such a horrible job trying to interview Bieber.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, just horrible.  But it turns out, you know, he did his live performance outside.  The kids were lining up at 48 hours before he performed, and they're on, what, 48th Street?  Yeah.  The line went all the way to 57th at one point.  Yeah.  You know how many people that is?  Some girl got a picture with him.  You know how many fucking people that is? 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  That's unbelievable.  They fucking love this kid.  Ah, he's crying.  He didn't say hi to me.  He just walks into the room.  He makes you feel so special.  Matt Lauer's an asshole.  Just comes across like a fucking asshole.  He's just looking out into the crowd going, I can't fuck that. 
[01:08:30]  Can't fuck that.  Well, there's a lot of older women, too, that lose their shit, because I guess they've got to bring their daughters, and then they get...  Who's the black guy with them?  Is it security or...?  Probably.  He's carting them around.  Oh, fuck yeah.  He's hot.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's the girl.  Right here.  It's all happening.  Oh, my gosh.  Matt.  Matt.  I don't know if you can check this.  He's the boy.  I'm in my distance, Al.  When we come back, we'll stop and talk to you.  Ah, she's not.  But first, these messages.  I love her.  I love her. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, boy.  You don't love anybody.  Stop with that.  You don't love her.  You don't even know her.  You walked up to her.  She said she loved you, and you love her.  You getting married?  He goes, I love you more.  I love you more.  Really?  You never jerked off to her poster.  You don't grind your hips crying looking at her.  You're not waiting a line cold to fucking meet her.  Yeah.  You gave her a half second.  I love you more later.  Yeah, I love you more.  What?  What?  Who?  What ugly girls that were there?  Oh, I know.  I took the fucking wedding scene from The Godfather. 
[01:09:30]  Thank you for having me back, man.  It's really good to see you.  Meantime, about this Christmas album, what were your emotions attacking a Christmas album?  Given that your own family has had a whole lot of fun, it's this Christmas album.  It's good for me because I'm able to give back, you know, being able to go back.  Shut up!  This is all fake shit.  Give back.  Go back to the question.  Give back.  Back to the question.  Give back.  Who are you giving back to?  You're not giving back.  You're fucking making a fortune. 
[01:10:00]  Good for you.  He's a nice boy.  He's a phony.  All right.  What's the question again?  The emotion.  What were your emotions attacking a Christmas album, given that your own family has had to  rely on donations at Christmas for Christmas dinner?  It's good for me because I'm able to give back, you know, being able to go back to my hometown  and give to the food bank that I actually got food from.  It feels amazing.  It was also hard to record Christmas album in September, but...  I'm hearing a little wigger talk on him. 
[01:10:30]  You know what it is?  He's trying to find himself and be cool.  Yeah, the older he gets, he's starting to sound a little more black.  He'll get out of here.  Yeah, talk to Mark Wahlberg about that fucking move.  Get out of here.  Huh?  Yeah, yeah.  It's just temporary.  He's finding himself.  Yo, I'm able to get back at the food bank.  I went to...  Really?  You're a little white kid.  Shut up with a wigger fucking talk.  I don't like when he talks like that.  You sound like a black.  I was yelling at my TV.  Get the Al Roker away from him.  That's what's happening.  That gangster. 
[01:11:00]  He was influencing young Bieber.  Yes, he was.  I love when his little angel voice rings out like a song.  Look at that.  That little hair you want to muscle.  Tussle, tussle, tussle.  I hit that again.  God bless him.  You recorded it, interestingly enough, after your voice had changed.  Yeah, yeah.  And so people who have not listened to it...  Time to change.  It'll be a little different.  It'll be a little different.  Yeah, my voice is evolving and changing for the better.  So it's been amazing. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, boy.  A new charity, Believe.  Yes, we're doing the Believe Charity Drive, which is basically...  He's just a perfect kid, everyone.  He says everything perfectly.  Including Pretzel the Promise, Make-A-Wish Foundation...  Pretzel the Promise.  No one is this pure.  No one!  There is a lot of good that comes with celebrity.  You know that.  There is also a pretty white-hot spotlight.  And you found yourself under it recently.  Yeah.  Oh, what?  Exactly.  Saying you're the father of a three-month-old son. 
[01:12:00]  What would you like to say about that?  No comment.  I'd just like to say, basically, that none of those allegations are true.  And I know that I'm going to be a target, but I'm never going to be a victim.  You know, I think it's crazy because every night...  It's crazy!  Yeah!  I've gone right from the stage right to my car.  So it's crazy that some people want to make up such false allegations.  But set the record straight, none of it is true.  Do you know this woman?  Her name is Mariah Yeeter.  Have you ever met her?  Never met the woman. 
[01:12:30]  No.  So...  All right.  Well, Matt...  He goes, never met the woman.  So he's like, move on, motherfucker.  Yeah.  Move on, Lauer.  He's too young to have sex.  He's a boy.  Lauer's looking for his exclusive, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He was looking for a little bump right there.  They are ugly people.  They're ugly girls.  They're the worst kids I've ever seen in my life.  What the fuck is going on?  Well, no.  Why?  Why?  That's all the fucking Today Show kids.  Oh, you think it's all the children of the fucking...  That's what happens around here.  No one else... 
[01:13:00]  Oh, my God.  You're fucking lutely right.  Well, let's just...  You think those are kids who like the executives and NBC people?  Yes!  Well, there is a Justin Bieber situation around SiriusXM.  Let's just put it that way.  And no one was allowed to bring their kids in unless you're a big fucking executive.  Then you bring in a lot of fucking kids.  Oh, okay.  Sounds nice.  Yeah, that might have happened.  And it happened at the Today Show, too.  All the Today Show kids get the front row.  Did somebody bring their kids in for Justin Bieber, you mean?  Oh, yeah.  But then someone else might have also, and they got in trouble.  What?  Am I right, Sam? 
[01:13:30]  I actually don't know this one.  Oh, Sam doesn't know this one?  No, I want to.  Whoa.  Yeah.  Gossipy Gertie doesn't know what's going on here.  Did the person who got in trouble, were they a management person, or were they on air?  A radio girl.  A radio girl?  Oh.  A radio girl.  But her kids are...  Bieber, the Biebs came in under, like, top-secret circumstances, and, you know, unless you're  one of the guys that runs the place, and then, you know, then you bring in a lot of kids to  look like a big shot.  Oh, boy.  But then if anyone else, like, decided to maybe bring, like, their kid in that day, not 
[01:14:00]  good.  That's...  Not good.  What kind of trouble do they get in?  A lot of yelling.  Wow, really?  Mm-hmm.  Is it their kid?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  So, to get back to the Today Show, those are all the fucking staff's kids.  Right.  They get all the prime seats.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah, those people that were waiting on the street...  For 48 hours.  Yeah, they're way in the back.  Way in the back.  You know, you're going to see them.  They're behind a building, listening to Bieber sing. 
[01:14:30]  Like, look at the...  By the way, when you look behind the...  The people...  Because they knew where they were going to interview Bieber.  They know where the cameras are set up.  Yeah.  So, those are the best seats, because you're right behind them.  Right.  There's a couple of really old people.  They're like, what are you guys doing there?  You're in your 60s.  And look at the bald guy in the back.  Who the fuck are you?  Yeah.  Those...  That's the staff.  Taking it all in, man.  Yeah.  I guess, in a way, I don't blame them.  It's the perks.  Yeah.  It's a perk for your nephews and nieces, I guess.  Yeah.  There's three really old guys in that picture. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah, yeah.  There's only 12 people in the whole picture.  No business to be there.  Yeah.  Let's see what else Matt Lowers does with this interview.  Along with life in the fast lane, as they say.  But what also comes along is this great opportunity, which you seem to have seized to do good.  I don't want it.  This is a...  Yeah, he's Superman.  Why is it...  What changes in you when you actually are able to do good?  Because I can tell...  Can you pause this? 
[01:15:30]  What is she trying?  Can she stop trying to get the Barbara Walters question?  Yes.  Man, man.  Just fucking say, holy shit.  Look at all these people that came to see you.  Yeah, would you fuck any of these chicks?  I wouldn't.  Right.  No one is that pure.  No one is that goody two-shoes.  She's trying so hard for a moment here.  Yes.  I'm sure Bieber is a good guy, but half the shit he doesn't want to do, it's his people.  Say, look, man, this is the image we got for you.  Set up a charity.  Oh, okay.  It seems to be working, so let's go with it.  I won't give back to my food bank. 
[01:16:00]  I won't give back to my food banks.  You didn't come up with that.  I would bet money on that.  No.  It's Usher.  Usher's the one who influenced him.  Oh, sure.  To talk like one of them.  Talk like a little white angel.  Let's finish this clip.  Like I said before, there's going to be goods and bads about this business.  And I want to just focus on what's real.  What's real?  What's real?  What's real?  The charity work that I'm doing for this album is real.  And this is real.  Like, I do it for these guys. 
[01:16:30]  No, you don't.  Do it for the time.  This is real.  It's been fun.  On November 23rd, we may have a few people here for you.  It's going to be for the day before Thanksgiving, which is generally one of the busiest days  on our plaza all year long.  And I have a feeling you're going to bring some more people.  Are you looking forward to that?  I'm very much looking forward to it.  No, we are as well.  You know, Justin, when you appeared here a couple of years ago, it was a much different  situation.  And now, here you are.  Can you still appreciate where you came from to where you are today? 
[01:17:00]  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  Of course.  Like, just being able to travel the world, like I just got back from South America, I  never, I never would have thought that I would be able to just travel.  Fuck any Brazilians?  I'm just very blessed, right?  It's just kind of cold weather.  You got your pants down a little bit low.  Yeah.  Don't you think you want to hype those up?  He's wearing his pants low like the brothers.  No, we don't.  Probably not.  There are lots of girls all around here who want to warm you up.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  Give him a hug, lucky girl.  I guess that's a different clip than what I saw.  He was there, what, for three days?  Yeah.  Off and on?  Oh, that's November 4th.  I was wondering what.  This month.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Because they really got into how great he is and how perfect he is and how pure he  is.  Someone got yelled at for bringing their kid here?  Amazing.  Yeah.  Radio girl.  And, you know, the guy brought in a lot of kids.  But, you know, but he's like the big boss, so.  Big boss.  There's a bunch of them.  The big boss man?  Oh, that would have been sweet. 
[01:18:00]  Blatter?  Where's he?  In a grave.  Oh, right.  What's wrong with the boss man?  Is he all right?  No, he's in a grave.  He's dead.  Oh, I remember.  When did that happen?  It was fun.  A couple years ago.  Wasn't he always fighting with Jake the Snake?  The Mountie.  The big boss man versus the Mountie.  Oh, you know when you were talking about, like, handjobs and stuff?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And women and stuff?  Sure, sure.  I want to go to break with this.  I'm watching this Woody Allen documentary on Channel 13, the public station here in New York. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, yes.  It's boring in general.  PBS.  But you wanted to see the Woody Allen documentary.  I've seen some of the interviews, but I haven't seen the final cut yet.  That's pretty good.  Yeah.  It's a little slow.  Okay.  No commercials, and it's like four to five hours long.  It's like, holy fuck.  But you forget that he directed Matchpoint with Scarlett Johansson, and they showed Scarlett Johansson in this Matchpoint movie.  Holy fuck. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  She's not as good looking as she was five years ago, though.  She's still a knockout, yeah.  But do you remember her in Matchpoint?  Fantastic.  Holy fuck.  I've seen an image.  I've seen an image.  They showed a scene.  Maybe we can find it during the break.  Holy fuck.  I lost my mind on the couch yesterday.  Jesus.  That was the first time I had ever seen her was when I saw that movie.  She's stunning.  She's ridiculous.  I think she's the fucking hottest woman in Hollywood. 
[01:19:30]  I really do.  There's no one I would rather sleep with than her.  Well, we saw her live at the Radiohead show.  Get moving on it, Jimmy.  And she doesn't look as hot as she used to is what I'm saying.  Oh, she looks great.  She's still phenomenal, yeah.  Yeah.  But in Matchpoint, holy fuck.  She has a great body, big, beautiful hiney.  I like her lips.  She's buxom.  I'm a big fan of her lips.  There's nothing on her I don't like.  Vaginal?  I wish.  If I found out she had fat lips, I'd probably start fucking stalking her. 
[01:20:00]  Whatever.  I guess we've got to find the scene they threw in the Woody Allen documentary.  But I was like, holy fuck.  That's right.  Matchpoint was a good movie, too.  Yes.  Yes, it was.  Jesus.  And, you know, Woody Allen, I didn't realize that he was making a movie every year since  he started.  He makes a movie every year, Ant.  Really?  He never stopped making movies.  I guess some of them aren't Annie Hall.  They said in the late 90s, moving into the, you know, the new century, he had a bunch 
[01:20:30]  of duds.  But he's back making some big-time quality movies.  Oh, man.  But he makes one a year.  Investors are not allowed to know anything about the movie, either.  When they want to invest in this movie, they don't get to see the script.  What the fuck is that about?  Well, I like that he does that, because he's not going to listen to them, because he's Woody.  So if you want to invest in a Woody Allen movie, you can.  If not, don't.  That's some kind of prospectus.  And he doesn't care if the actors change his script. 
[01:21:00]  And he doesn't do a lot of takes, because he wants to go watch the Knicks.  I don't want your damn word, Woody.  I want FDIC.  I guess the documentary's pretty good.  It's, you know.  But you learn a lot about him.  He's not as strict as people have said over the years.  Yeah.  These pretzels are making me thirsty.  He doesn't use a little village, as they use.  They call them those little villages where they have all the monitors around them. 
[01:21:30]  No.  Yeah, like, just to see what's going on.  He actually just sits there in a chair, fucking watches.  Really?  Yeah, he's real bare bones.  He really sounds like he doesn't do much.  Have you watched a lot of Woody Allen movies?  Yeah, over the years I have, sure.  My problem is that he uses the same people.  That always bothered me.  Oh, okay.  After a while, I mean, he had Mia Farrow in a shitload.  He had Diane Keaton in a shitload of movies.  And he's fucking you, you're in his movies.  Yeah.  Basically.  Yeah, but that was his thing.  He would just reuse the same people.  Yeah.  And I think that took me out of a bunch of his movies over the years. 
[01:22:00]  But, you know, he still uses the same goddamn typewriter he started with.  Oh, you knew that, too?  They have trouble getting inked for it.  Yeah.  I think he's a weird OCD guy, but he will use that same typewriter to type off.  And they're trying to explain copy and paste.  And he's like, no, this is what I do.  And he pulls out his stapler.  And if he fucks up, he cuts that out.  He does it right.  And then he staples it in place where it is on the paper.  That's crazy.  And they showed his typewriter.  It's falling apart.  But he said, the guy that sold it to him said, this typewriter will outlast you. 
[01:22:30]  It'll work long after you're gone.  Get a computer.  And he still uses it.  He's one of those guys that's just part of his thing.  If you get stuck in a, I think Stephen King is something like that with his Mac, too.  It's like, you get stuck in a rut and it works.  Yeah.  It's like, why would I fuck with this?  It's like, one more.  One more with this one.  I was thinking about it when I was watching.  I'm thinking, God, Jimmy would fucking die if he could have Woody Allen's typewriter.  Typewriter.  Could you imagine?  I wouldn't even want it.  It's literally too much for me to have. 
[01:23:00]  Typed on that?  That's why I couldn't handle it.  He says he's used it for every project.  With Woody's taste in girls, it's probably good he doesn't have a computer.  You can't download anything onto a typewriter.  Yeah.  Does he not have a computer?  I don't know.  You would think he would use it for writing.  He doesn't read reviews.  He doesn't really know what people say about him in general.  A lot of people have said.  Does he still play that stupid clarinet? 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, they showed him playing his clarinet.  He blew off the Oscars because he didn't want to miss his Monday night gig.  His gig.  Wow.  Yeah.  And he's legit.  There's some guys that blow off Hollywood and the award shows, man, because they're trying  to be different.  Woody really just doesn't care.  No.  He's been offered everything.  If he wanted to do Letterman or The Tonight Show, they'd give him the whole hour.  He could just play the clarinet.  He could do whatever he wanted, and he's not interested.  Yeah, he doesn't care.  He's just one of those guys.  He's not fake.  No, I don't think so. 
[01:24:00]  Because he could make more money on his movies if he did this way or promoted them that way.  Turns out his son's an egghead, too.  His son graduated law school at 15 or something.  I don't know the exact numbers, but he's one of those kids.  Oxford or something?  Yeah.  I think it's Oxford.  He graduated college at 15.  He's like some genius.  He's a legit genius.  Why isn't Sam still pulling up pictures of Scarlett?  Sam's a Peter pumper.  He's just sitting there.  There's pictures, thumbnails all over, and I'm not seeing fucking pictures.  Oh, my God.  I want to see a video clip from Matchpoint, though. 
[01:24:30]  God, she's beautiful.  The lighting in Matchpoint just fucking accented how beautiful Scarlett Johansson is.  See, that's not a good shot.  Sam isn't good at this.  That's Jake Johansson, the comedian.  He's terrible.  Sam, you're terrible.  Oh, David Johansson.  Oh, Sam.  Sam.  Oh, wait.  How did you not click on the one where...  Which one?  Right there.  Which one?  That one.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God. 
[01:25:00]  Look at her breasts.  What would you do with that?  My erection would fail, probably.  I'd be too nervous.  Oh, man.  Imagine that.  She'd laugh at you.  Didn't she have sex with Benicio Del Toro in an elevator?  That's the rumor.  I don't know if it's true, but either way, I don't blame him for not squashing that rumor.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let that one fly.  Yeah, that's not one you want to correct.  And that kind of, you know, makes her look like one of those bad girls.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What do you mean she has man tits?  I'm fucking blocking you, Puddle of Ace. 
[01:25:30]  What?  What is wrong with you?  What does that mean?  What is wrong with you?  What does that even mean?  You homo.  What are you talking about?  You're full of turkey.  What do you mean man tits?  Uh-oh.  What happened?  Sam got some spam.  Oh, really?  Spam Sam I am.  Yeah.  At least spam Roberts.  Oh, yeah.  Look at those fucking man tits.  Yeah, they're really masculine.  Stop it.  Yeah, that was a man like.  You're an idiot.  Wrong with you.  Don't listen. 
[01:26:00]  I forbid you from listening to the program.  I would like to take us to break with a song.  Oh, please do, Jimmy.  I'd love to hear it.  Please do.  It's your host with the most in the Poconos, beautiful Mount Airy Lodge.  Did you do your Poconos gig?  I did, but I stayed in Mount, beautiful Mount Airy Lodge.  Oh, you did.  I got to take a leak.  I want to hear all about it after the break.  There's not much to hear, but that song has been fucking tap dancing in my head for 72 
[01:26:30]  hours.  That's all they play up there, right?  Everywhere you go, you got to hear that stupid jingle.  I just remembered it from when I was a kid and couldn't stop singing it.  Yeah.  Yeah, and I sing it well.  Oh, you do.  It sounded pretty good there.  I heard that, yeah.  All right.  Fantastic.  Now this.  Sirius XM.  This is the OPN3 Show.  Got Dr. J coming in today. 
[01:27:00]  Julius Erving.  Yes.  Oh, wait.  What's going on?  Yeah.  I'm thinking.  Who is this?  Oh, this is Randy Newman.  Oh, sorry about that.  Getting topical.  Hold up.  Wait a minute.  With the sex man. 
[01:27:30]  What's up, sexy?  Good morning.  Sexy.  What do we got today, sexy?  Well, today is Randy Newman's birthday.  He's 68 years old.  68, huh?  How about that?  How was your Thanksgiving?  Uh-oh.  Delicious.  Busy.  You can run down all the stuff you ate.  Because people want to know.  He's like Hitler to turkeys.  Turkey Holocaust. 
[01:28:00]  I did all right, man.  Except for the strawberry rhubarb pie.  Rhubarb.  And apple pie.  Fuck.  Rhubarb.  And homemade ice cream fucking cake.  Fuck.  Oh, that sounds good.  And fucking M&M cookies.  Shit.  Thanksgiving is fine.  Wow.  Oh, and my sister brought fresh lava cakes.  Fuck.  Oh, man.  That's a lot of dessert.  I did not have dessert.  I started the show by talking about my mom, but in general, we had a fucking blast. 
[01:28:30]  God, I just fucking ate.  Yeah, huh?  How about you, Rock?  What do you eat at E?  Are you writing it down?  No, I was marking on the log here.  I had turkey.  Lots of stuffing.  Oh.  Oh, oh, oh.  Can I talk about Mary's stuffing?  Mary.  My sister-in-law.  She went, you know what?  Between the potato cat and what I'm about to tell you, I think we might have went a little  too white trash.  Oh, yeah? 
[01:29:00]  She, her secret ingredient in the stuffing, would anyone like to guess?  Jack Daniels?  Think white trash.  Huh.  All right.  Mullet hair?  Mullet hair?  No one's going to get it, so this is a dumb game.  White trash.  She put, um, beer?  Beer?  She put White Castle hamburgers.  Oh, boy.  It was fucking delish.  Of course.  Holy shit.  It was so goddamn good.  That is really white trash.  Yeah.  How the fuck?  It was amazing, though. 
[01:29:30]  Think stuffing.  So, it had the stuffing flavor, but that was the main ingredient.  So, it was like, it was a broken down White Castle hamburgers with the onions.  Yeah.  Oh, dude.  Damn it was that good.  So, like, wait a minute.  With the buns and everything?  Yeah, yeah.  Or just the breading and stuff.  And you would say this is stuffing.  Hmm.  White Castle fucking burgers.  Damn it was a good.  Not the buns. 
[01:30:00]  Just the meat and the onions, you know?  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  Giving it that White Castle flavor.  I guess.  Doesn't sound bad.  All right.  Continue, Iraq.  Stuffing.  Oh, that sounded really good.  Hey, Iraq.  So, the stuffing, mashed potatoes, and cranberries.  That was about it.  What about desserts?  Desserts?  We were having...  It goes fuck.  That's about it.  Oh, dessert.  Desserts.  Well, for desserts, we were having Thanksgiving plus celebrating somebody's birthday.  So, there was a raspberry lemon cake, which was very good, very sweet. 
[01:30:30]  Had some apple pie with vanilla ice cream on it.  There was a lot of other desserts, but that's what I ate.  You're just not playing today.  There's no way that's all you ate.  No, that's true.  I didn't have the pumpkin pie.  There were cookies and a bunch of chocolate stuff, but...  Yeah.  Well, you don't like chocolate.  No.  Not a big fan.  We've learned that.  By the way, Iraq is a seer. 
[01:31:00]  I was going to do this later, but we have him on mic.  There's a chick that did exactly what Iraq is paranoid about.  And a lot of people pointed it out on Twitter.  Forced her significant other to join a gym.  Sorry, Eric.  I didn't mean it.  Where's the fucking story, man?  You got a woman who, yeah, man claims ex-girlfriend stole his sperm to create kids.  And this is Iraq's worst nightmare.  I remembered.  Oh, yeah.  The Nagel seed.  Huh?  You think he's worried about the Nagel seed being harvested? 
[01:31:30]  He's worried about Prince Nagel's precious golden seed.  Eric, this was your thing growing up, right?  This is what I was talking about.  That's why you always took your sperm with you, right?  Yes.  Because there's a lot of psychos out there.  You tie up that condom and you put it in your front pocket and you get the hell out of there.  He puts it in the small pocket that's in the pocket.  Oh, that's right.  Was it the small pocket?  Yeah, you wrap it in toilet paper and you put it in that little change pocket that you have inside your pocket.  Because you were worried that what?  Women would take it and use it and try to get money off you. 
[01:32:00]  Get themselves their own little Nagel.  Right.  Everybody wants a Nagel, doesn't they?  Who doesn't want a Nagel?  A very valuable seed.  Well, the New York man was stunned to find out that his four-year-old twins were not in accidental pregnancy after all.  But that his desperate girlfriend secretly stashed away his sperm and used it for an in vitro procedure.  Damn.  Joseph, 36, was not planning on having children with Anetria.  Anetria.  Anetria.  Anetria.  I'm saying that right, too. 
[01:32:30]  Anetria.  With whom he was in a relationship for six months in 2007.  Six months.  So she took matters into her own hands in order to remain...  Took matters into her own mouth.  ...in his Texas house and made a legal bid for half of his possessions.  Jesus.  Fucking cunt.  A gold digger is an understatement.  She was trying to get community property and alimony.  She's ruthless.  But how do people know she stalled the cum, though?  Yeah.  Well, let's see.  That's a tough one to prove.  Joseph, a telecommunications manager, said he hooked up with Burnett when he lived in Texas, 
[01:33:00]  and he was a little surprised when she announced she was pregnant.  We always use condoms, he said.  But when a DNA test proved him to be the father, this guy, Joseph, said he began paying $800 a month in child support.  The real bombshell dropped last February when Joseph got a strange receipt in the mail for sperm, cryopreservation, I guess.  I've never seen this word. 
[01:33:30]  Cryopreservation?  Yeah, they freeze that sperm up.  Yeah, I know cryogenics and all that.  Free that shit.  Confused, he called the company that had sent him the paperwork, which referred him to the Advanced Fertility Center of Texas,  where a manager asked him to sign a release form.  That is when he said he uncovered the bizarre plot.  She was taking the Siemens in condoms after the fact and running down to the clinic with it, said Jason Gibson,  who was representing this guy, Joseph, in his suit.  Joseph then said he confronted Burnett, an exotic dancer, who allegedly told him, 
[01:34:00]  Oh, you're not stupid.  I thought you knew.  Oh, boy.  Oh, brother.  She was looking for a payday, and she got it.  She certainly was.  Like, with that one, what do you do?  Like, what's the legal...  I guess he's legally responsible, but he shouldn't be.  He shouldn't be.  He absolutely shouldn't be.  She stole.  Stole the seed.  Wow, the Nagel.  Sex man should write a book.  Sex man is just...  He knows.  He's on top of his game.  We laughed.  We laughed.  What do you call it?  The Nagel seed?  The precious Prince Nagel seed. 
[01:34:30]  The precious Prince Nagel seed.  That's how he saw it.  And he wouldn't even get rid of it, like, in the toilet or anything like that.  He fucking took that rubber home with him.  He can't chance it coming right back up in the bowl if you flush it.  Well, you never know.  You're right.  It could splash up and impregnate it right there sitting on the bowl.  You don't want a baby made of fucking semen and cum...  Oh, I was going to say...  I don't.  Oh, Jimmy.  Talking about cum, you get all excited. 
[01:35:00]  I don't understand.  When sperm leaves the body, it doesn't survive too long.  But if it's in a condom, I don't get this.  Probably more of a closed environment, especially if you tie it off.  Sperm will last for a while.  Yeah.  In a condom?  Yeah, yeah.  But they say if it's outside the body, how long does it last then?  It will start dying off, but I guess by the time you get it to the fertility clinic, you've got to get it there pretty pronto.  I'm sure she planned this out.  Sure.  Let's ask Dr. Steve.  If there's sperm on a woman's belly, how long does it last? 
[01:35:30]  And if there's sperm in a condom, how long does it last?  A tied-off condom.  That's the question today.  Well, there's enzymes and fluids that will protect it.  And they eventually begin to evaporate, but as time goes on, the sperminozoa will die out.  Sperminozoa.  I would carry it in my mustache to the clinic, and then I would wring it out like an old dishrag.  That's the best way to carry sperm.  You have to prepare yourself, because you put it in an icy environment. 
[01:36:00]  You mainly have to get it in ice, because the fluid will just evaporate.  Good morning, gentlemen.  They still have their motility.  John, what do you got, buddy?  He wants to talk about frozen cum and Tabasco for some reason.  John, what the fuck?  For a shrimp cocktail.  Morning, guys.  Have a good day, Jimmy.  Hey, what I've always done, take precautions to prevent that exact same thing.  Put Tabasco sauce in the condom when you're done. 
[01:36:30]  Oh, now, obviously, take it off your dick first.  Yeah.  Because, wow, that would hurt.  Who wants to use the Tabasco sauce at his house, knowing it's been in all those fucking  rubbers?  You just go for a nice late night snack and you jizz on your fucking taco?  Wouldn't that just give you a Mexican baby?  Ba-da-ba-ba-da-ba.  Oh, man.  I had a buddy that...  Boo!  What happened?  I had a buddy that did it in college and his girlfriend shoved it up inside her trying  to get herself pregnant.  She was screaming down the hallway about four o'clock in the morning. 
[01:37:00]  Screaming?  About what?  Yeah, because she put the condom up inside herself and then the Tabasco hit her and it  burned.  Oh, okay.  Gotcha.  I want to thank Tucker Max for calling the show today.  I don't...  Yeah.  I don't believe that.  Why?  There was a midget and shit.  It's all over.  All right.  Was there a really wacky frat boy douche?  And then everybody just started shitting and puking all over the...  Really?  Shut up.  It never happened.  Really?  Fucking college boy?  Shut up. 
[01:37:30]  I watched that video again a few days ago.  Like, what?  We were all just fucking so embarrassed.  Oh.  We were in with him for a while, too.  Because someone else was calling out Tucker Max on his lies and then they referred to  our show.  They said, if you want to know about Tucker Max, you should check out some videos of him  on it.  And then, like, the midget...  Was puking and...  What?  And we liked him at first because we thought, like, wow, this guy's pretty interesting.  He's got some cool stories.  Well, the story started out okay.  What happened was, if you guys haven't heard the story in a while, Tucker Max is having 
[01:38:00]  sex with his girl, but he has a dude in the closet.  They're filming the whole thing.  And what got me was when he said he lost the tape and he doesn't know where the tape is  anymore.  Oh, I know.  The whole story falls apart.  So there's no proof to the story that he was some...  What happened?  Like, he pulled his dick...  He pulled his dick out of...  If I remember right...  He was fucking her in the ass and...  Do his shit.  And he started puke...  Oh, there you go.  Right there.  Oh, he started...  He started puke.  In 2021, I was spending a summer in Florida when I was in college. 
[01:38:30]  And I met this one girl.  She's really high.  Of course.  I had never tried butt sex before.  And I really wanted to.  So I kept trying to convince this girl...  Pause, by the way.  She's like, no, I don't know.  Just for you guys in studio, there's so many tells.  Oh, yeah.  I studied some of this in college.  There's so many tells.  He can't look anyone in the eye.  And those little coughs, those are complete fucking lying tells.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And he does it a lot.  That's the only reason I wanted to pause.  So you'll see it for yourself.  He can't look at any of us as he's telling this outrageous story that never fucking happened 
[01:39:00]  that was in his book.  I don't mind, by the way.  I don't mind.  A New York Times bestseller, by the way.  Number one, yeah.  I mean, he's very successful.  And I don't mind a funny story if it's made up.  But when you're coming on and you're selling it like it's real...  That's fiction.  That's what kind of bugs me.  But if it was a made-up story, it was funny to read, good.  And he had to tell us so many times it was real, which is another tell.  He had no confidence that we were going to believe that it was real.  So we weren't like, no, whatever.  As gullible as other people, obviously. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, she wouldn't.  She's like, no, I don't know.  So I finally convinced her.  I'm like, look, you know, it's like she wanted to be a runway model.  That's why she was living in South Beach.  I was in Florida at the time.  So I'm like, you know, it's what all the models do, blah, blah, blah.  So I finally convinced her by convincing her that, like, it was what, it was like the  European way to have sex.  This is like the level of intelligence of this girl.  And, like, I'm kind of an asshole now, but I was possibly the worst person on earth at  this point in my life.  So what I hadn't told her was that my buddy and I decided that since this is going to be the  first time I've had butt sex, that I wanted to videotape it, right? 
[01:40:00]  And, but instead of just, like, setting up, like, a camera, this is, like, nine years  ago, so it was before, like, you know, like, really cheap cameras, we had, like, one of  the, like, the sort of shoulder ones.  Yeah.  Right.  That had, like, the VHS, sort of like that, except the crappy version.  Right, right.  And so my buddy hid in the closet with the camera.  No, he didn't.  And was going to film us.  Like, so he was hanging out at my place, and then, you know, he saw us pull up, and he  was going to go run in the closet and hide.  And so I was so shit-faced by the time that I got back, I, at this point, I had pretty  much forgotten that he was in there. 
[01:40:30]  So we go in, we start kissing, whatever.  Everything's going great for a while.  You and your friend?  You know, and we start going harder and harder, and she's more into it, and I'm more into it.  And, like, I'm right about to come, and, you know, I'm slamming hard, come way in and  out, and I come out too far, and I kind of, like, you know, I come out, and I, like, you  know, hit her butt or something.  So I go down to put myself back in, and all of a sudden, I feel this, like, warm splash  on my hand, and I'm like, the lights are kind of low, so I look down, and it's, like,  kind of dark, and I'm like, wait a minute. 
[01:41:00]  And then the smell hits me, shit, all over my head.  See, this could happen.  Yeah.  And it wasn't just, like, poop.  It was, like, dire, like, watery, dire, like, fucking mix of, like, diarrhea and astroglide.  Pause.  And so, like, finally convinced me.  Were you believing him at this point, Ed?  Well, at this point, it could, it's viable, it could happen.  Fair enough.  You could get somebody, like, all right, you want to videotape it, and then, you know,  the girl shits on his dick.  It's happened.  Yeah, because I wasn't sure your reaction was, because you were uncomfortable. 
[01:41:30]  No, then, then.  It starts to get so uncomfortable, because none of us are buying this after a while.  Right.  I did believe it up to this point, though.  Oh, sure.  Everything had to be over the top.  It couldn't be just regular shit.  It had to be diarrhea.  You'll see.  I was giving him the benefit of the doubt, and I was just kind of like, all right, whatever,  you know, it's a story.  Right.  I've had that happen during anal.  Like, where you just get shit on your dick.  It's like, hey, it is what it is.  Or they do.  They do. 
[01:42:00]  I'm going to shit.  I'm going to shit.  I'm going to shit.  But I've gotten shit on my dick before.  It's fucking awful.  Jim Norton's shit dick.  Shit dick.  Shit dick.  Shit dick.  By the way, ReddingWB on Twitter just fucking gave me a link to the White Castle stuffing recipes.  There's many of them online.  Oh, wow.  Should try it for yourself.  Trading recipes on the Twitter, huh?  Fuck yeah.  All right.  Another thing.  We don't eat stuffing.  We only eat stuffing and turkey once a year. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah.  When will it be the next time you eat stuffing?  Exactly.  All right.  Maybe Christmas.  Oh, Christmas.  It was like diarrhea.  Like watery.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  A fucking mix of diarrhea and astroglide.  And so, like, the smell hits me.  And it was like, oh, my.  And then, of course, I'd be like, shh, shit on my dick.  And then combine that with, like, the seafood and then two bottles of wine.  And I just, I blow all over her ass.  Like, in her asshole, everywhere.  And so, I'm throwing up. 
[01:43:00]  And she's, like, kind of hammered.  And she, like, turns up.  She's like, Tucker, what are you doing?  She sees me throwing up.  She goes, oh, my God.  No.  She's not throwing up everywhere, so.  No, she doesn't.  I don't see her throwing up.  I remember this day like it was yesterday.  My laugh is the uncomfortable humor.  Really?  It's so full of shit laugh.  I'm out.  I didn't realize that he was, I think.  I was out when he was.  Yeah, now I start going like, oh, boy.  I was out because he had to put everything over the top.  When the cameraman puked, I think we, he, like, all of us were like, we can't even go with this anymore.  But I think I bleed him up to this point.  Did she blow a horse after? 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, it is what these stories are coming to.  Anything about midget sex and all that stuff, like that type of shit.  It's like, it's just corny.  Oh, wow.  That's really crazy.  No.  What a wild night you had.  Ugh.  He's making me throw up.  I'm throwing up more.  All of a sudden, true fucking story, my fucking buddy falls out of the closet.  No one will fall out of the closet.  He's like, oh, my God.  Yeah, because he saw us and, you know, smelled it.  I mean, you can imagine the smell.  You know, it's like seafood and wine and Astroglide and shit.  And he fucking is throwing up everywhere. 
[01:44:00]  So, like, there's like a three-second period where all three of us are staring at each  other, vomiting everywhere.  That video would be like...  I know.  You have no idea how upset I am.  I don't have to.  I know.  I was a little suspicious when he was telling the story because I'm wondering, you have to  have the tape.  Yeah, dude.  It was like, you remember the big cameras where you put the VHS tape in?  He fell out and, like, the little tape itself broke.  Of course, like, the magnet, you know, it's magnetized.  We could have easily gone and changed it.  But it's like, I didn't think, you know, it's like, remember you said you don't write 
[01:44:30]  down your stories?  I didn't write this stuff down at 21.  I started writing it down at 27.  The tape broke when he fell out puking.  Is that what he was saying after he said he lost the tape?  And that destroys the tape?  It doesn't destroy the tape, by the way.  Wouldn't you absolutely want that tape?  Yes.  If all this was going on, it's like this Bruder film.  It doesn't destroy the tape.  Yeah.  Ugh, what an asshole.  I'm sorry.  I'm not sure exactly what you do.  I'm not sure if you could just tape it together at that point or I don't know.  You believe me, there's ways, yeah.  Yeah.  If a tape, you can tape, and there should be a glitch in the tape where the- 
[01:45:00]  I'm trying to remember old school.  You can scotch-  Old school camcorder.  You can scotch tape the tape itself back together and put it back in the case.  From the back.  And there's just a glitch.  All right.  So it is like that.  And if it was all, like, wrinkled and all that-  It would do that weird.  But you could just-  Where it's there.  You could just cut that part out if you had to.  And then tape it together.  Yeah, okay.  That's what I thought, but I wasn't sure.  Yeah.  So that's bullshit.  Yeah.  Of course you have the tape if you were filming, but you weren't filming because it's a fake story. 
[01:45:30]  Hit it.  Like, oh, we should save this tape.  The tape was broke.  I was like, oh, fuck it.  Just whatever.  You know, it didn't occur to me.  That, like, I was going to ever do any of this shit.  You know?  If I had known I was going to become a writer, motherfucker, I would have, you know, gone through hell and high water and said that.  Are you kidding?  I think people are a little pissed off because you don't have the videotape.  I think that's made a lot of people very uncomfortable, including everybody in this room.  Well, you get the bitch fell, I mean.  Not me. 
[01:46:00]  Fell in what?  I don't need no fucking tape.  Absolutely.  Pause.  You're buying it?  Are you uncomfortable?  So uncomfortable.  Okay.  By the way, I love watching moments, because we all know each other so well.  Yeah.  There are times when I'll hear, like, oh, that's raised by an alcoholic Anthony.  That's co-defendant Anthony.  He wants to fix everything.  Or that's me being crazy or me being fucking pathetic and groveling.  Like, it's funny when we watch these whole tapes and we know each other's personalities.  It's like, oh, God, that's...  It made my day when I called him out, say we're all uncomfortable in the room, and he's just 
[01:46:30]  staring down at the ground.  He knows he's in deep shit at that point.  Well, that was the old studio, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, a beautiful studio that we had to leave for this shithole.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or I catch myself going, yeah, yeah.  Like, an uninteresting celebrity story that we all know stinks, and I'm like, oh, you  fucking worm.  Did you get the picture?  I know.  How does this end?  Not well.  His stories are hysterical.  Yeah.  Fucking shit.  If he's sitting on the ball, the fucking log's coming out as some girl's sucking on his  cock. 
[01:47:00]  I don't need...  Okay.  Hold on.  Hold on.  That's another story.  Now, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  I agree with Jimmy.  I do do these codependent bullshit stuff.  I love Anthony.  But I'm actually...  I remember this.  I'm just saying the stories like, oh, man, that's fantastic.  Knowing, at this point, the jig's up, and I'm just fucking around.  I know it's phony, but I'm saying that it's not to, like, fuck with you guys.  I swear.  Okay.  I swear.  I believe you.  Because this guy was so full of shit. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah, because this is a...  You know, this is a...  His appearance cut down.  There's a few edits in here.  Right.  So I guess he told another story where he was taking a dump and some chick was blowing  on him, has a log stick out of his ass.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Shut the fuck up.  Oh, God.  I'll take a true story from a guy with fat tits and an appendix scar any day of the week.  Yes.  And the only exaggeration is he takes some of the gay stuff out.  Okay.  Go ahead.  Play.  All right.  All right.  Go ahead.  Thank you, Tucker, man. 
[01:48:00]  Tucker, thanks, man.  Thanks, man.  I hope they serve beer in hell as the New York Times bestseller.  Jimmy's head is in his hands.  Thank you, sir.  He awkwardly walks around.  No, do it, do it, do it.  Threw the book right at the door after he left.  I didn't hear what happened to the tape.  What happened?  Because, like, that would be something he would want.  He said something about, you know, it was the old days where it was the big, clunky VHS. 
[01:48:30]  I felt like it was clunking.  You know what part got cut off?  Because Steve made this edit a long time ago.  Yes, I wanted faces.  It was when you kept hitting the button going, you're a liar.  Oh, right.  Remember that?  That's what I was waiting for.  That was what's so uncomfortable.  As he's telling the story, you were hitting the button going, you're a liar.  Right.  There's a couple of lying buttons.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I still got them.  That audio, if we have that, that's where it began to build and become uncomfortable. 
[01:49:00]  Right.  And he leaves the studio.  It was a long walk out of that studio, unlike this one, where if Jimmy steps back one foot,  he's out the door.  And as soon as he closed the door, his book hit the door.  Yeah, it was awful.  Yeah, yeah.  The book went flying into the door.  Is that it for the tape, pretty much?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm surprised.  They don't show the, does he not have the call in?  We tried to get him to call in, but he wouldn't.  We had sent an intern out there with him.  Right, right.  It got really uncomfortable.  Oh, my God.  But that didn't show nearly the uncomfortable nature of it. 
[01:49:30]  The publishing industry allows that to happen, I guess.  Guys make believe they're real stories when they're not.  Yeah, I mean, it's probably, they're not real stories.  I don't mind it if it's under the guise of, hey, here's some funny stuff that I exaggerate.  We all exaggerate in comedy, but when it's just that over the top and you're telling  it to people live, it's like, come on, bro, how do you expect us to, it's like, don't  ask us to perform with you.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  Like, you're asking us in a way.  Putting us in a bad spot.  To help you along.  To make us look like complete idiots in front of the listeners. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah, we don't do these bits.  Yes, Mr. Rock?  I found a tiny clip of what Jim was talking about with the liar.  Okay.  Do you want to hear that?  Oh, fuck yeah.  You know, I mean, I was, whatever, 17, I didn't know what the fuck I was doing.  Well, I guess I kind of did, but I pretended I didn't, and I blew, you know, I blew my load  in her mouth, and she got pissed and spit it in my face.  Like, she came up all mad with something in her mouth and right, right, all in my face.  Goddamn liar! 
[01:50:30]  I remember that.  Dude, that still makes me uncomfortable.  Yeah, that's great.  Oh.  Yeah, all these crazy things happened to him.  I know, what a wild life.  I've been paying for sex for 20 years, and I've never had half of those, or any of those  things happen.  He's probably a guy like most of us when we're going through our, you know, growing up years.  We had a couple crazy things happen, and then he's like, thinking, I can make a book  out of this, but I'm going to have to make up at least 12 bullshit stories to sell  the book. 
[01:51:00]  And so over-the-top bullshit.  Right.  Like, God, you can't even come up with stories that are viable.  That fucking shitting and puking thing, it just wouldn't happen.  Plus, it was dark, so what?  They were filming with night vision goggles?  Of course.  Yeah, we ran through some of the logistical problems that that whole thing was.  The friend falling out of the closet.  The one falls out of a closet.  Yeah, but puking.  Your friend makes a big entrance.  What is this, a sitcom?  Yeah. 
[01:51:30]  Fucking Larry Klein.  Larry Klein.  I fucking hated that guy.  I just, yeah, I didn't like the, I just didn't like that phony shit.  His appearance on our show has haunted him ever since, by the way.  Yeah, I think it really bugged him.  Yeah, because he, I guess other shows would just go along with it and say, oh, fuck, this  is great.  These are good stories.  It's probably like, to be fair, the 1996 version of us might have said, fuck it and 
[01:52:00]  went with it.  Oh, probably.  Yeah.  But now that we're bitter old fucks, no fucking way.  Yeah.  What do you got?  No, I remember how to go after him and he was crying in the hallway trying to call his  publicist.  Yeah, because everyone took care of him.  Yeah, because he over the door and all I heard was, he threw a book at me.  I threw the book at the door since he left.  I wish I could have thrown it at him.  I kind of liked my job.  I only threw strawberries at shoes.  I didn't throw books at fucking offers. 
[01:52:30]  Right.  Fucking covered.  Fucking covered.  God, that fucking song was, that stuck in my head over the weekend.  No.  Yeah, yeah.  Come on.  J-j-j-julia.  You're, what?  You're uncontrollable.  Uncontrollable.  Oh.  This was, he's a good voice.  Oh God, he's terrible.  This was almost a hit.  I'm telling you right now.  No, he's so bad.  His vocals are terrible. 
[01:53:00]  Ah, yeah.  You can watch this any time.  Where's your music video?  I don't have one.  I wish I did.  I got you with me on the street.  On the street.  So feminine.  I got to point out, I've never seen more red in a YouTube video, by the way.  Look at this.  It's barely green.  You're looking at 59 likes and 393 dislikes.  That percentage is pretty off. 
[01:53:30]  All right.  His voice is so bad.  But he has the white gloves and a cane.  And a cane and a top hat.  How could you have signed on for that and thought this was good?  He looks like the putting on the Ritz guy.  Yeah.  Putting on the Ritz.  Da, da, da, da.  Yeah.  J-j-julia.  He's awful dancing. 
[01:54:00]  He's awful dancing.  How great is it to have a rich father, though?  I'll just do this shit for you.  I know, right?  Just paid for a real fucking music video.  Anything to get him with girls.  Yeah.  It looks like it could be a Puff Daddy video.  I think that's what it was.  The father's just like, yo, just lots of girls.  Yeah.  Please surround my boy with girls. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  Dad, I want to have sex with a prostitute.  Here's $10,000.  Marry her.  The shopping bags are on him.  Who is he trying to fold?  He comes to Hulk, which is very catchy.  Oh, yeah.  Raul J-j-julia.  You're uncontrollable.  J-j-julian from Less Than Zero.  That weak fucking yell. 
[01:55:00]  Even the girls in his own video are trying to turn away from him.  They're embarrassed.  It's horrible.  Oh.  Oh, God.  Does he make you uncomfortable?  Yes.  He's break dancing.  Break it down.  Julian.  Listen to that.  It's horrible.  It's horrible. 
[01:55:30]  That chick was hot.  Is this before auto-tune?  Yeah.  They could have pumped that up and...  Should have auto-tuned him with that Rolls Royce.  That was a nice throwaway line.  That was very fun.  Auto-tune with Rolls Royce.  Now he's singing over himself.  Yeah.  He's doing like the come hither fingers.  Yeah.  How embarrassing.  Where is he?  Beverly Hills?  Is that Rodeo? 
[01:56:00]  It looks like Wilshire Boulevard.  Is that Rodeo?  Could be Rodeo.  I think it's Rodeo.  Yep.  Oh, boy.  And that was just his dream.  Right?  Because he's...  He's the chauffeur.  Or is he?  Take me to Chanel.  No spoilers.  She's good, though.  Oh, yeah.  She's great.  Aren't we making jokes how he would sit on the ornament?  Were we?  Yeah, yeah.  We were saying, because it's a Rolls Royce, and the hood ornament comes out of the little  radiator part of the car because people steal those. 
[01:56:30]  And we were just saying how he would sit on it and then press the button.  See, because then the hood ornament would go up his asshole.  But the funny part is the license plate is J-E-W-L-I-A, Julia.  Yeah.  And I just keep thinking her last name, her name is Leah.  Julia, yes.  Julia is a very angry license plate.  I like it.  All right. 
[01:57:00]  That, that, yeah, always a pleasure.  Always a pleasure to see that one.  Oh, what's, I mean, I can't think of a fucking worst.  Yeah.  Beautiful.  Mount Terry Lodge!  Does he have a follow-up?  How was the Poco Nuts?  It was fun.  It was a very good gig.  Noah doesn't have another?  It was enjoyable.  I'm just working on the show.  Oh, no, he's got one video from three years ago.  Holy shit, he just gave up on showbiz?  Is that only three years ago?  He used to have an artist site, and then that video came up, and then after he was, his 
[01:57:30]  dad told him he couldn't intern here anymore, all his music stuff disappeared.  Oh.  Poor kid.  J-J-J-Julia.  Well, why don't we say hi to-  I'm not attracted to you.  Whoa.  What's, J-J-J-Julia, where is it?  It was a big sports weekend, guys.  It certainly was.  And we got Racist Francesa on the line.  Oh, hello.  Mike A.  Good morning, boys.  After a two-week hiatus, I'm back on the most popular broadcast in morning radio. 
[01:58:00]  How was everybody's holiday?  Oh, that was pretty good, Mike.  I'm sure we didn't eat as much as you did, you fat fuck.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  That's a very, very hurtful word.  I thought you'd be more in the holiday spirit here after reading your White Castle stuffing.  Did you drink red wine out of jam jars?  Very nice, Mike.  Thanks.  I mean, you want to tell me that it's delicious?  Oh, fine.  It's delicious, okay?  I'll give you that.  It's delicious, okay?  It's delicious, but it is like trash. 
[01:58:30]  I'll be honest here, okay?  Over Thanksgiving, okay, quickly, I took time, okay, for a man that has everything, knows everything,  and has seen everything, okay?  During Thanksgiving, I like to take time to reflect upon those that are a bit less fortunate  than myself, okay?  So, as my wife put the bird and with all the trimmings on the table, okay, and I was  wearing my festive holiday sweater, okay, and my fireplace, I started to think about those 
[01:59:00]  who are less fortunate, okay?  I thought about the crack-addicted nigger who is hiding underneath the staircase vestibule  waiting for the almighty social security check.  We can't be part of your racism, Mike.  That's terrible.  He's being thankful, though, Ant.  Oh, he was being thankful or something?  Yes, yes.  You got confused.  I just heard the hatred, Opie.  I just heard the hatred.  Oh, here comes the thankfulness.  Yeah, I thought about the single-spick mother with the seven-illigrant children doing the 
[01:59:30]  cha-cha above my head at midnight, okay?  Cha-char.  I thought about the Qing slave in the 24-hour Chinese restaurant frying up wings for said nigger  mentioned earlier.  No, see, I can't sit here.  Only to have his brains blown out during a delivery, okay?  And be party to this, Mike.  Wow, they're overly racist today, Mike.  And finally, I thought about the homeless runaway teen boys blowing each other down at Christopher  Street with nothing to get in return but a doctor visit, okay? 
[02:00:00]  And as I plunged my electric carver into the golden brown bird, it dawned on me that I am  a better person than 99.9% of the population out there.  And that was what I was thankful for this holiday season, I'll die.  Wow, damn.  All right.  I thought you were going to talk about sports, but fuck.  We'll move right in.  That's it.  It's called the opening monologue, okay?  That's the opening monologue, okay?  Anyway, so when I do that on Thanksgiving, besides drinking so many Diet Cokes that my 
[02:00:30]  loads were carbonated, okay?  And searching for a clean copy of Dara by As Is on the internet all week.  Yes, yes.  Almost as good as Julia.  Yeah, one of my sources from, not sources that you put on the trimmings, sources like  inside sources.  Right.  They're called from the deepest, darkest, from the belly of the deep pits of hell, okay?  There are people everywhere, okay?  And I have been informed that Mr. Thiebaud is not a Jesus freak. 
[02:01:00]  In fact, he is the evil dark wizard, okay, of the underworld, okay?  He is Satan in the flesh, okay?  So from now on, refer to his doings on the gridiron as a work of the black magic, okay?  So from now on, we're going to chalk that all up to the evils, okay?  That one didn't really fly.  I still like it.  I still like it because his friend says it.  I'm a fucking truck driver here, okay?  Give me a break. 
[02:01:30]  I think it's terrific.  Kind of liked it.  You went with a different angle for the team, huh?  Okay, so quickly, Jeff, big win, okay?  I don't buy it, but I'm going to make the playoffs, okay?  You can say what you want in the playoffs, okay?  Urinating on the sidelines, is this what the league has come to?  Let's be honest.  Well, that was Novak.  He had to go.  When you got to go, you got to go.  There, Mikey.  Exactly, and that leads into my Francesa fact, okay?  This is a fact that you may or may not know about, of my Francesa, okay? 
[02:02:00]  Did you know that underneath the console, I am sans pants, sans underwear, okay?  It does give you good visuals, right?  And there's actually, it's a plastic potty seat, okay?  And I just do my business there, okay?  You can't interrupt the phone call with Jimmy Johnson or Troy Aikman, okay?  When you're talking cowboys, okay, to the little boys' room, okay?  So what I do is I just really feel over myself, okay?  And that's what I do, okay?  A potty seat. 
[02:02:30]  Okay, so that's it, okay?  Since I bombed, but I kind of recovered there, okay?  Listen, they're not all gems.  I think it was, I love all the calls, Mike.  Absolutely.  Okay, boys, I love you like you're my own, okay?  All right, thank you.  All right, it's probably, it's one of the best impressions of anybody.  A guy that sounds a lot like Mike Francesa.  Very racist today.  Oh, my God.  We don't approve of that shit.  Oh, it's terrible.  It's fucking hilarious, because I, just to hear Francesa saying those awful things makes  me laugh every time. 
[02:03:00]  Oh, boy, let's say hi to Casey.  What's up, Casey?  Opie, did you just say a Puff Daddy video?  Yeah, that was my reference.  What's wrong with that?  I guess it's an old reference, right?  Yeah.  It's not his name anymore.  Huh?  No, it's not his name.  I hear he's going back to Puff Daddy.  Puffy, maybe, but not Puff Daddy.  Oh, Puffy.  Where are we at with him?  Is he Diddy now?  You call him Diddy.  You call him Puff.  Puff, but not Puff Daddy? 
[02:03:30]  His name's not Puff Daddy, no.  My reference is pretty accurate, because when he was Puff Daddy, he was making those over-the-top,  fucking slick-looking videos.  Early 90s, man.  I'm going to stick with my reference, because they don't really make those type of videos  as much anymore.  Not like that, right, Sam?  With the Rolls-Royce and the Broads?  Yeah, it's definitely more popular.  Well, J-J-J-Julia.  That's right.  You just described J-J-Julia.  That's right.  I know.  See, look, it almost looks like it, except everyone's black in this.  Yeah, Diddy's doing J-J-Julia. 
[02:04:00]  My reference is pretty good.  Eddie Griffin?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, this is a video for Can't Nobody Hold Me Down.  Oh.  What year is this, 98, 99?  Yeah, somewhere around there, with Mace.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Is this video, thank God Big E died?  Notorious B-I-motherfucking-J.  He never said, thank God Big E died.  Why?  Why would he?  He was his friend.  Secretly, he went, holy fuck, this is good for me.  He was a crony. 
[02:04:30]  How do you not think that?  He was a cohort.  Well, he was a producer.  He was a minion.  He was his producer.  He never would have gotten the notoriety.  He made so much fucking money because Notorious is dead, period.  Yeah.  He would have never been that successful.  He was like fucking too short.  He wasn't that.  He was like motherfucking too short.  I mean, he was still running the, you know, running the label that Big E was on.  Did he rap back then?  He rapped on Big E's songs in the background.  He was a side guy.  Okay.  Yeah.  He was just a crony.  He was the executive producer, though. 
[02:05:00]  Crony.  Really?  Executive producer.  I don't think so.  I mean, he did the...  His biggest song was probably, uh, I'll Be Missing You.  Well, that's a police song.  Oh, that's the one that put him over the top.  Yeah.  That brought him from...  Let's hear this.  That brought him from Minion.  He was here at T-Mobile.  Oh, shut the fuck up.  He was still the executive producer of Bad Boy Entertainment.  Sure.  Oh, boy. 
[02:05:30]  Bad Boys.  Bunch of hope.  Freeze.  Fucking commercials.  Christ.  Christmas.  We get it.  Oh, my God.  Christmas.  It's Christmas time.  Holy shit.  Oh, he's got to be on his motorcycle.  I hate videos of lead-ins.  Yeah.  I know.  He just wants to show off the cool bike he bought.  There's a dope bike.  How long is this?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  He fell down.  Ah.  Why'd he fall off the bike?  Oh, things were going so well. 
[02:06:00]  It's symbolic.  That was symbolic of what happened.  Oh, that's good.  Yeah.  See?  It goes out.  There we go.  This is the police.  Yeah.  It's a sample.  No, that's the song.  It's barely sampled.  Check it out.  Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show.  I laced the track, you locked the floor.  So far, I'm leaning on the block.  Anything worse than hearing different words there?  I know.  You just want to start singing the song.  Right.  Every breath you take.  All of a sudden, you got this mumbo jumbo.  Yeah.  Here it goes.  Mumbo jumbo.  Give me, Britt. 
[02:06:30]  In the future, can't wait to see.  If you open up the gates for me.  Open up the gates.  How about you come up with your own riff and then?  You got to hear the hook.  And spew that shit.  You got to hear the hook.  Damn it.  It's hard to be.  It's a good song.  Yeah.  Yeah, because it's a great voice.  I know you're still living your life after death.  Oh.  Who the hell's that?  Faith Hill.  It's Biggie's wife.  Oh, shit.  Is that his wife?  Oh, yeah.  Not no more.  No, technically not.  I pray I'll be missing you. 
[02:07:00]  So what did Puff Daddy do so far except that mumbo jumbo?  Well, he was re-ramp the first verse.  He produced the track.  Mumbo jumbo.  Nothing wrong with Sambo.  Oh, he's back on his bike.  Things are good again.  See?  The only thing.  Now, are there any clips of Diddy, Daddy, Puffy, whatever, with Biggie?  Oh, he fell off his bike.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  See?  Now, let me see him as a cohort.  Yeah, let's do some cohorts.  Let's look at what he was.  See?  He's the fucking lead guy in this video.  This put him over the top. 
[02:07:30]  Well, that was his solo, you know.  Yeah, but his rap is...  I don't know shit about rap.  But it doesn't sound very, like...  It is a little...  But he's competing with the police riff.  That's tough.  This is big, right?  This is the biggest song.  This is the biggest song.  Now, that's a rap.  Fuck!  One of the most famous rap songs ever.  Feed my daughter.  You can hear Puffy in the background going,  It's all good.  Oh, is that it?  It was all a dream.  I used to read Word Up magazine. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah, motherfuckers!  I did see Puffy's track, too.  Hangin' pictures on my wall.  Nah, this is bullshit.  Where's Puffy?  He did this track, too.  Diddy ain't...  His face ain't on the motherfucker.  Effortless.  Goddamn it.  Ramp again.  Biggie was the shit.  He didn't rap and you's rap friends.  So where's Puff Daddy?  Do you get it?  You move him out of the way,  you become the star.  Yep, that's what happened. 
[02:08:30]  He was already...  I bet I would look into P. Diddy.  There's his voice.  Yeah.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  He was just a crony.  Seriously, where's Puff Daddy?  He wasn't anybody.  He did this track, though.  No one knew him.  What did he do?  He was like the Dr. Dre, right? 
[02:09:00]  He did what?  He was like the Dr. Dre.  He did the beat.  You don't have to put it with the beat.  No, but I mean, that's his job.  Yeah.  It's notorious B.I.G.  Effortless.  Back.  Effortlessly rapping.  Before Biggie died, right?  Do you think he'd be having these parties out in the Hamptons and everyone would show up?  Yeah.  No.  They would be going to B.I.G.'s house.  No, they wouldn't.  He would get the leftovers.  He's a crony.  Did he get shot in 96 or 97, man?  Somewhere a while ago, yeah.  It's been a while.  All right.  I'm going to. 
[02:09:30]  Down to the East Coast.  God damn it.  I'm not a huge rap guy, but that shit is fucking good.  I didn't really listen to his stuff.  He's very good.  Damn it.  Is that good?  You've never listened to it?  Wow.  No.  I kind of bailed at a rap before then.  Every time one of those songs comes on the radio, you just got to listen.  That's him right there.  Let's see.  Who?  Oh, this is a video of Biggie and.  Where's Puff Daddy?  That's him in the hat.  Where's B.Diddy? 
[02:10:00]  He's the year guy?  The hype guy.  He's the year guy.  I never want to be the year guy.  He's the year guy.  He was the year guy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's Flava Flav, motherfucker.  Oh, yeah.  Look at Diddy.  But he's the year guy.  Yeah.  Biggie was Puff's artist.  Now, Biggie would do just fine on his own.  Wow.  Without that little tick.  Somebody's got to put the album out. 
[02:10:30]  You think Puff Daddy's mic is even on?  It doesn't seem like it's even on.  He's letting him play on the stage like a little kid.  Bring your kid to work day.  He did have to get fucking Biggie out of the way to become the big star that he is now.  He was the executive producer.  He would never have been the big star.  He is now living under Biggie's shadow.  He was making money.  Ready, Sam?  Puff Daddy.  Overrated.  Big time overrated.  In what respect?  In every respect.  He worked Biggie's death with that fucking police song, and that put him over. 
[02:11:00]  Listen.  What are they bringing gold records out of the state?  That's what they used to do.  That's hilarious.  There's some fucking one of his cronies just brings out a bunch of gold records and starts  showing them to the crowd.  Like, look at me.  Fucking rappers are hilarious.  They used to roar.  I don't know shit about the game anymore.  Yeah, look at this shit, motherfucker.  My gold records is on the stage.  It's like show and tell.  This was right when East Coast, West Coast was heating up.  Oh, yeah.  No shit, it was heating up.  Where did your loyalties lie? 
[02:11:30]  You got to stay in the East.  Oh, yeah.  But Puff Daddy was trying to squash the beef, and then, you know, Suge Knight wasn't about  that.  No.  Suge Knight was about trying to hype this beef up.  Well, and Suge lives on.  Wow.  Wasn't Puff, and I could be wrong, wasn't he like a real gangster, though?  Like, some of the people he was associated with were fucking real gangsters.  Both sides were associated with real gangsters.  Yeah, like, he wasn't just some pussy guy or producer.  Like, he actually had real connections to some very bad people.  I don't believe it.  He was the yeah, yeah guy. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Wait, yeah.  Yeah.  He also produced all the tracks.  Produced the tracks?  When you have a voice like Notorious B.I.G., is that impressive?  Yeah, you got to have a good producer.  You got to have a good beat.  I've heard.  No.  How about we beat you?  Shut up.  I guess someone had a...  See, look at this Puffy in the hypnotized video.  Just like...  This video's, like, way over the top.  Look at Puffy and Biggie.  There's helicopters.  I know.  It's like Apocalypse Now.  Fucking...  You know why?  Because his music sucks. 
[02:12:30]  So you got to fucking trick people.  This is a Biggie song.  You got to trick people into thinking they're watching Mission Impossible.  Yeah, motherfucker.  Notorious B.I.G. didn't have helicopters.  This is Biggie's video.  But Notorious B.I.G. would just be walking down the streets in Brooklyn and rapping.  That is Notorious B.I.G.  It's right there.  There's always money and broads.  Oops.  Oops.  Money, broads, and some crystal in that video.  And big gold rings.  Yeah.  Oops.  Why can't a rapper just be in a library?  I'm embarrassed.  Yeah.  Listen to that track.  It's like, helicopters are chasing us.  Let's start rapping.  Whose influence was this? 
[02:13:00]  That's Puffy's beat.  No.  No, it's not.  I know this song.  Yeah, this is Apocalypse Vice.  What song is this?  Hypnotized.  No, what's that?  What track are they using?  Help me out.  I'm looking.  I'm looking.  Take that.  Take that.  Herb Albert Rise?  Is that what that is?  You can sample.  It's not illegal to sample.  Oh, man. 
[02:13:30]  Who's steering the boat?  They're just driving the boat and nobody's steering it.  Everybody's rapping.  You gotta steer the boat.  Look at Puffy just dancing with his friend, Biggie.  What is he doing?  Does Puff sing on this?  I mean, he's in the background going, take that.  Take that.  I raised you $200,000. 
[02:14:00]  And now, like, the song stops and there's more action movie stuff.  It's an epic video.  It is epic.  It's hypnotized.  Oh, look at the hummus coming down into the parking garage.  Gonna fuck Biggie up, yo's.  Well, listen, we have to, like, hit a break if we want to relax before Julius Erving, Anthony.  Yeah, motherfucker.  Are you good with this shit?  Yeah, bitches.  You good with this shit?  Yo.  Talking this much about Puff Daddy and then Dr. J.  Hey, Ant, this is not your show. 
[02:14:30]  This is great.  Dr. fucking J.  Black History Month is coming up.  Why is the J man coming in today?  Promoting, I guess, Xbox.  I thought it was a charity.  There's a game, NBA 2K12.  That's right.  He's in it.  He's one of the legends.  So at least you'll be able to see some basketball.  I'm gonna be nervous.  Are you?  Really?  Yeah, I grew up fucking loving Dr. J.  He played for the Nets when they used to play at the Coliseum.  The Nets.  I am dating myself.  And my daddy brought me to a game with my brothers.  It was the, I think they were called the New York Nets back then. 
[02:15:00]  And they played the San Diego Conquistadors.  Was that the ABA?  That was the A fucking B fucking A.  Was he on the same team with Rick Barry?  I don't remember.  Rick Barry.  My memory isn't that good, but I remember it was the Nets versus the San Diego Conquistadors.  Conquistadors.  How are they doing these days?  Look it up, man.  Oh, that's right.  That was a real fucking team.  Wow.  ABA shit.  Yeah.  That was brave on his part.  He said, fuck it.  I'm gonna do this ABA thing. 
[02:15:30]  Puffy is sitting in the hot tub in the Big Papa video like a dummy.  He's not like a dummy.  He's chilling.  He's not chilling.  He's trying to figure out how to take the fucking B.I.G. out.  He was the executive producer and he was running the label.  He wanted to be in the spotlight.  He was in the spotlight.  His fucking persona back then was as a sidekick.  He wasn't a sidekick.  He was the boss.  He was the yeah, yeah, man.  Oh, he's the yeah, yeah.  The boss.  The boss. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  It's kind of like what you're looking to do.  Me?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're Puff Daddy and over there thinking, fuck, I want the fucking big seats.  Exactly.  I'm your yeah, yeah guy.  You're the yeah, yeah guy right now.  Oh, God.  Are you enjoying being the yeah, yeah guy or do you want to be in the spotlight?  No.  I'm thinking about how to take you all out right now.  Now you fucking understand.  That's right.  West Coast in this bitch.  West Coast.  East Coast.  Give us a yeah, yeah, Sam.  There's no tease in any of that stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  See?  You're the yeah, yeah.  All right. 
[02:16:30]  Dr. J next.  Is that good?  Yes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I hate to piss badly.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Any plugs again?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I forgot.  Mugubi's.  Mugubi's.

People look forward to that.  See, look at that.  There he is.  He's in the hot tub.  He's in the hot tub like a dummy.  No, he's not.  He is in the hot tub like a dummy.  He's just making out with chicks and Biggie's like, what's good, Puff? 
[02:17:00]  I love that.  What's good, Puff?  13 million views.  Puff's like, that's my homie Biggie.  Biggie Smalls.  That's going to make me laugh all day.  He's in the hot tub like a dummy.  He's not a dummy.  He's a millionaire.  I saw 25,000 likes and 529 dislikes.  Fuck them.  They're probably West Coast.  Yeah.  East Coast.  East Coast.  Nothing but haters with their haterade.  We bad boy in this bitch.  Haterade.  Haterade.  Haterade.  Oh, God.  They just aren't peculiar.  They're just dopey haters.

[02:19:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Back live after a short little break.  I got my mouth full of Pop-Tart.  I see, Dad.  Mmm.  It's delicious.  Got Dr. J coming in.  In a moment, eh?  Yeah, I'm going to ask him.  My elbow hurts.  Yeah.  And I'm going to ask him what I should do for it.  I don't get it.  He's a doctor.  Oh!  Right?  Oh! 
[02:19:30]  Isn't he?  Oh!  I should have got that.  I'm sorry.  How does he, uh...  I'm reading the one sheet.  I'm trying to get all my info together for the big interview.  Oh!  Maybe we should have done this, uh, last night there.  Maybe.  Opster.  But what I'm learning it, and I don't know if he wants to talk about this, though.  Wow.  Dr. J reportedly recently auctioned off...  Is he here?  I don't know.  Uh, auctioned off his 1974-1983 championship rings after being sued by the bank for an unpaid  loan.  Holy fuck! 
[02:20:00]  I didn't know this was going on.  Look how much.  He, uh, however, has said that the lawsuit and the auction are completely unrelated.  Okay.  Is he going to get into this?  This is a story.  He writes, uh, it says the 86 ring went for about $200,000, while the 1974 ABA New York  Nets championship ring fetched $460,000.  You know who was up late on the, on the, was one of the owners of the team, but I think  the guy who owns the 76ers was bidding on this stuff.  Oh, really?  To help out Dr. J?  Oh, I don't know.  Or to get it for himself? 
[02:20:30]  Just to get it.  He wanted to, he said he wanted to keep the memorabilia in, uh, Illadelfia.  Ill, uh, did...  I just called it that.  I call it Killadelphia.  Oh, all right.  Oh, they do say that as well, yes.  Fucking Eagles got their ass kicked, huh?  Mm.  Okay.  I don't know.  Okay.  Uh, yeah.  Dr. J, uh, has had a hell of a life so far.  How old is the doctor?  Uh, he retired at 37. 
[02:21:00]  I think he made it into, uh, what year did, uh, Dr. J retire?  I'm going to guess he's 60.  I think he's older than 60.  Maybe.  He's older than 60?  That's why I said I'm going to guess and not fact.  So he wasn't, he wasn't raking in that fucking money that they are now.  You were, you were so close to 61.  61 years old.  He'll be 62 in February, though.  February.  February.  How tall a man is he?  Four foot eight.  I'm going to guess.  Let me guess.  I'll go wrong.  Six, uh, five.  Oh, Jim, you're just... 
[02:21:30]  You're six, six?  You're one-off Jim today.  Yeah.  It's six, six.  Okay.  One-off Jim sucks.  I like one-off Jim.  Well, he said four foot eight, which couldn't have been more wrong.  I thought it was close.  It wasn't.  I knew he could jump pretty high.  We'll be able to see him coming down the hall, right?  That's right.  Because that's like, it'll be like, oh, there's a tall guy.  Six foot six guy.  Yeah, yeah.  Right, right, right.  Got you.  Yeah.  Like, I wouldn't mistake Travis and go, oh, I thought it was Dr. J while I'm down the  hall.  No.  Why does Travis...  Unless it's Dr. Jerkoff, then you think it might be him.  Travis, what do you got on the discussion? 
[02:22:00]  Dr. Gay.  Well, we were talking...  Hi, Dr. Gay.  What?  Hi, Dr. Gay.  Hi, Dr. Gay.  Dr. Gay.  I'm a nurse, too.  Hi.  Hi.  It's me, Travis, Dr. Gay.  Yeah.  Let me check back there.  Let me check back there with my you-know-what.  Ooh, I don't have female patients.  Ooh.  You're Dr. Gay.  Very yucky.  I check butts with my fingers.  Ah, Gay.  And I smell them to see if you're sick. 
[02:22:30]  Ooh.  Is that Dr. J?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  He's very tall.  It has to be.  What do you got, Travis?  I was just going to say that he, unfortunately, you know, was in the NBA before big contracts.  Like, his last year, he only made $1.4 million.  No.  Yeah.  And that was his last year, so-  One percenter.  You know how fucking huge he was?  Yes.  He was the Jordan of his time.  Why are we not bringing him down?  Why are you saying that?  He's probably signing his release.  Okay.  He was the Jordan of his time. 
[02:23:00]  When did the-  Oh, did you see this hockey fight?  Travis did.  No, this is a great hockey fight.  We'll try to talk about this.  Two old CFL guys.  I guess they had an incident on the field 48 years ago.  Are you kidding me?  And they really went at it.  Yes.  Wow.  The guy threw his cane.  He could barely walk.  And the other guy tried to offer a peace offering, a little white flower, saying, let's get over  this.  And they fucking beat the shit out of each other.  They're punching in the face.  That's how great is that?  They're old men.  They're probably both pushing 80. 
[02:23:30]  And they're beating the shit out of each other at some kind of banquet for the CFL.  We'll try to get into that after Dr. J is making his way down the hall.  What are you doing with Dr. J's headphones on?  Yeah, what are you doing?  You're not a doctor.  Well.  Come in there.  He's tall.  Exactly.  Tall must be weird.  Why don't you sit in his seat?  It must be so odd to be that tall.  Holy fuck.  He's a legend.  Yes, he is.  He's a legend.  This is a-  We're going to bitches with him.  Fuck, man.  Jesus.  I thought you'd be here with a couple of your bitches. 
[02:24:00]  Dr. fucking J entering the studio.  I know where I'm to shush.  Yes, I know.  Travis was shushing me.  Hi.  There he is.  Hello, morning.  Dr. J.  Julius.  Sir, take a seat.  How are you doing?  How are you, man?  How are you doing?  Good, good.  All right.  It's American tradition shaking hands.  Oh, yeah.  I like it.  That's the lovely Sam Roberts.  Now, are you a shake hand guy?  Or are you like the culture of-  The culture of hugging do you think is a little weird? 
[02:24:30]  Are you more of a handshake guy?  Hugging is all right.  Oh, okay.  You know what?  That's the Sammy Davis Jr.  You know, I got to hug you because it's the last time I see you.  I just got really-  Especially when you're on the back nine, right?  I just got really mad.  Why?  Because we just learned your last year in the NBA, you only made a little over a million.  You were the Michael Jordan of your time.  Yeah, I made like about a million four, million six, somewhere in there.  A lot of money, no matter how you look at it.  But knowing what they're making now-  That was a lot of money to me. 
[02:25:00]  Right.  Oh, yeah.  At the time.  That must have been nice.  I wanted to put this on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When did the big contracts hit then?  The over-the-top?  Early 90s.  A few years after you-  Yeah, I got on 87.  Oh, my God.  And maybe like the early 90s.  And then the jump was probably from, you know, the mid twos to four, six.  And then it just kind of escalated from there.  Did it hurt to see that? 
[02:25:30]  No, I always thought about Oscar Robertson and Wilt Chamberlain and Bill Russell and,  you know, the guys who fought to try and get to $100,000 a year.  Oh, wow.  You know?  Did they have that big job?  That was, that was, that was, that was, that might have hurt.  Yeah.  But a six-figure contract, I mean, I've, I made six figures at least throughout my whole career.  Right.  And seven figures the last couple of years.  That was it.  But that was it, yeah.  We're looking at one of the greatest players ever.  Ever. 
[02:26:00]  Did you get, did you get annoyed?  It's only money, man.  It's only money.  Look at my quality of life these days.  Yes.  It is.  It's Black, it's Black Monday right now.  You guys want to talk about money on Black Monday?  What is it, Cyber Monday today?  Cyber Monday.  Today's Cyber Monday.  It was Black Friday.  One of those things where you're supposed to spend a lot of money.  Small business Saturday.  What was yesterday?  We took a break from all that?  I think so.  Yeah.  I'm glad.  That was travel day for me.  Travel day?  I flew in from Atlanta.  You play a lot of golf, right?  Yeah, I played too much last week.  I went straight downhill, man. 
[02:26:30]  That last day, I was like fuming.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I went off the course.  My nemesis had beaten me like a drum.  And then I threatened not to even bring my clubs on this trip.  But I bought them anyway.  Yeah.  What kind of handicap?  I probably played 12.  That means he's an 8.  Yeah.  He's an 8.  No, that actually means I'm a 15.  Because you never play until you're handicapped.  Right, right.  When you do, that's when you're really playing well. 
[02:27:00]  Right.  12, but I can't hold it.  You usually buffer the handicap so you can make a few bucks on the course, though.  No.  He's an 8.  No.  He's an 8.  I can see it.  Not my last round.  No.  I made nothing.  No.  It's a good thing we have a cap.  See, we have a $100 cap.  So no matter how bad you're getting beaten, you can't lose more than $100.  Oh, yeah.  So I was out of 105 on the front side.  That's how bad he was beating me.  And I'm putting it on blast just so I can negotiate some strokes next time. 
[02:27:30]  That's nothing to do with the money, either.  Nah, it's bragging rights.  It's bragging rights.  And then when you're just sucking, and there's nothing you can do about it, what are you going to do?  Yeah, you've got to go in the bullpen.  Right.  You've got to switch over to baseball.  You've got to have something in the bullpen to go to.  And I didn't even have anything in the bullpen.  No.  It was a sad day.  But I'm cool.  I'm glad to see you guys.  How do you feel?  I don't play a lot of athletics.  Okay. 
[02:28:00]  Okay.  Jimmy.  Just chime in on that one.  I'll tell you what he was doing.  He was hoping that you would notice him as an athlete, and there would be some kind of surprise.  Like, really?  With a body like that?  You don't play sports?  Yeah.  You know, my physique.  I've been working on it.  I do the elliptical.  I'm sizing you up for soccer, though.  Yeah, you'd be good at soccer.  That's probably because he thinks my face would be perfect to bounce a ball off of.  No, you've got the sweatshirt on.  That's a good start.  Los Angeles on there.  Yeah.  1888. 
[02:28:30]  That was a long time ago when you played.  You know, it was embarrassing that somebody spotted this and went, you got that in the airport,  didn't you?  I'm like, yeah.  This was what I was going to be called on my flight.  Trying to run away from the TMZ guy, right?  Perfect day for you to be in here.  The NBA figured out their differences.  What was that about?  I don't really understand.  It was about dinero and about stubbornness.  And it was about a little bit of desperation.  I mean, I think the percentage of the gross concept totally broke down in this economic climate. 
[02:29:00]  And, you know, the owner's inability to make money or break even or even come close was compromised with the agreement that was made by both sides.  You know, so it was ironed up until it expired.  And then there was a hard position taken.  That league could not survive going forward in this. 
[02:29:30]  A lot of teams claimed that they were in big time trouble, right?  They were.  Financially.  They still are.  They still are.  Yeah.  I think there's probably going to be some change of ownership across the board in the next three to six years.  And the owners were able to knock down the players' percentage a bit, right?  I think it was negotiated out and, you know, more to a 50-50 scenario.  I mean, that's just what I'm hearing.  Right.  Which still means, I mean, you know, you get 50% of revenue, but you still have to pay all the expenses if you're on the management side. 
[02:30:00]  And that's always going to be there.  So managing your expenses becomes critical.  And running a tight ship is the modus operandi unless, you know, unless you've got Amway money.  So this wasn't the owners just being greedy?  Because I felt like, ah, the owners just don't want to give the player.  This is that case where they actually had a legitimate point.  As a former player, you know, it's probably blasphemous for me to say this, but I think they definitely had a point. 
[02:30:30]  And in terms of both sides, I mean, if a few billion dollars have been compromised in this process, then it's a lose-lose scenario overall.  But I think the feeling was the league could not continue to operate and be viable with the present agreement being matched. 
[02:31:00]  So if things stayed the same, it was going to be dramatically different.  Are games really not sold out, though?  I guess the ones I've seen or just always seen, but it's full, but are they playing half-full games?  Yeah.  Across the board, I think there's a lot of arenas that are only half-full.  Attendance was down.  Oh, okay.  They're only half-full.  You know what I mean?  And you have now, I mean, bigger, beautiful arenas.  So you've got 22,000 seatbelievers everywhere.  And if the number is 11, 12, or 22, you don't necessarily see it on TV. 
[02:31:30]  And then when you watch the playoffs, you know, it's exciting because people come out and you get the walk-up crowd.  So you get another 5,000, 6,000 people.  But there are a lot of games that are on Tuesdays and Thursdays or whatever.  But it's also the cost.  It's tough to, you know, pay for some of these tickets.  You don't want to comment about that.  I haven't bought a ticket in a while.  Yeah.  How close are you to the games, though?  I go to some Hawks.  I go to some Hawks games. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah?  I didn't have to buy any tickets.  I go to some Sixer games.  I didn't have to buy any tickets.  That's how you know the league is in trouble.  I kind of stay on the sideline.  Imagine being the guy that tells Dr. J, look, you don't have a ticket.  Like, look, we'd love you to come, but VIP parking, we just can't do it.  It's like always VIP parking.  Yeah.  It's like a dagger in the back.  Right.  No, some of the good news this summer, when the Sixers changed hands and Comcast and Ed  Snyder sold the Sixers to Josh Harris and his group, including Will Smith, the first thing 
[02:32:30]  they did was slash the ticket prices.  They said, look, we got 11,000 people in 20,000-seat arena.  We got to get more people in here.  And the ticket price was the first thing that was addressed.  So, you know, being somewhat of an insider there, when I heard that, I said, you know,  that's great.  That's smart.  Good news.  That's wisdom right there.  And that's a good first step.  Right.  You know, get more people to come and then improve the basketball team.  Yeah, start there.  Let's get the basketball team.  And the team was a playoff team last year. 
[02:33:00]  We've got a lot of promise, great young talent, great coach.  Do you have tabs on the whole league and everything that's going on?  It's so hard.  It's so hard.  I mean, I'm 61, and I can't remember what I ate.  Breakfast.  I just had breakfast like 25 minutes ago.  It was continental.  I can't remember that.  You don't look 61, by the way.  You're doing something right still.  I think that is a compliment.  You really don't, man.  Whatever that's supposed to look like, I don't know. 
[02:33:30]  You look younger than 61.  I feel good.  61 is the new 41 in some circles, right?  What do you think of LeBron James?  Do you think he has the heart of a champion?  LeBron is awesome.  When you say the heart of a champion.  Well, like you had, like Jordan had, like Bird and Magic Johnson.  It seems like he's missing something.  He's got all the skills in the world, but he seems to kind of choke a little bit in the playoffs.  Well, he's missing the validation of his greatness, and, you know, that'll come in time. 
[02:34:00]  I mean, I don't think there's anybody who doubts LeBron's going to be a champion and maybe a multiple champion before his career is over.  But then eight years in, it hasn't happened.  Into the finals a couple of times, you know, it's very frustrating.  But when you really look at what he did in Cleveland with a high school resume, you know, taking that franchise to the finals and, you know, putting the team on his back every year and just making them a contender. 
[02:34:30]  And you see where they are now without him.  So, you know, I look at that, and I don't really like to evaluate and compare guys to all-time greats until they get 10 years in.  Right.  So if after 10 years, you know, there's still that void, still not the end of the world.  I mean, Charles Barkley didn't get a ring.  Karl Malone didn't get a ring. 
[02:35:00]  John Stockton didn't get a ring.  Patrick Ewing.  Let's go with Patrick Ewing didn't get a ring.  So the whole ring, that's my droid, actually.  Oh, yeah.  That little noise.  Promotion and advertising.  Yeah.  Sorry about that, guys.  It's all good.  Turn it down in a second.  We don't care.  It's probably LeBron calling.  He's saying, you better.  Yeah, man, thanks a lot.  Just don't throw me under the bus.  I think he's an amazing talent.  And with his heart, there's, as good as he is, you know, he's still, what, 26? 
[02:35:30]  You know, I mean, I think I hit my peak at 26 and then maintained it for five years, five or six years to 32.  And I was MVP in the league in 32 and champion in 33.  So that window for him, and if he hits it right now and sustains that, if he stays where he's at for the next five or six years, no telling what he can do. 
[02:36:00]  Sure.  But, you know, every summer you need to add a piece to your game.  Right.  So what got exposed with Dallas was probably the lack of a mid-range game, lack of, you know, posting guys up.  I mean, you know, LeBron taking Jason Kidd in the low post and, you know, he should have his way.  Jason's a tough guy down there.  He's not going to back off, but he should be calling for help.  Right, right.  So there's a way to simplify the game, too.  I'd rather see post-ups with Jason Kidd than fall-away jumpers off balance. 
[02:36:30]  And that's judgment when you're on the court.  So I don't know if that's hard or if that's really training, conditioning, understanding what it takes to win, and then, you know, playing the percentages.  Dallas did an amazing job last year of playing the percentages.  They kept the ball in the hands of Dirk Nowitzki, Jason Terry.  They said, those guys, these are our scorers.  These are our percentage guys.  I don't care if they miss 11 in a row.  They should take the next shot.  Right.  And probably there was, you know, you've got to look at the sidelines. 
[02:37:00]  You know, maybe Miami got a little outcoached, too.  Mm-hmm.  Did you notice as a player, like, when you're playing a game and it's what you do and you're, you know, considered one of the greatest we've ever played,  do you notice as time goes on, like, wow, man, I think it declined a little bit?  Like, is there a point where you get to where you're like, ah, I'm not at my peak, or is it really hard for an athlete to see that?  It's hard to accept it, but Connie Hawkins said it best.  He said they got to lower the rim or raise the floor because the hawk can't soar no more. 
[02:37:30]  And I know exactly what that felt like when I was, when I started a play and I got in the air and I used to be able to, like, get to the rim and dunk it, and now I get to the rim and flip it.  It's like the dunk turned into a flip.  So, you know, you got to make a concession at some point in time.  You know, people...  Yeah, time doesn't respect anybody.  People always talk about your dunks, but you had some good flips, too, though.  You did all right with the flips.  Fortunately, I could flip, but if you're a guy who can only dunk and can't flip, then you're really in trouble. 
[02:38:00]  It's like an embarrassing moment.  Right.  Hey, who would be your top five of all time?  I'm sure you've been asked this a lot, and it's probably a hack question, but...  Yeah, a little bit.  A little bit, it is.  But, you know, I always, always, always, yeah, always create controversy when I say it, because, I mean, I established my five when I was probably 13 or 14.  Wow.  And it was like, those are my guys. 
[02:38:30]  Which means Will to Bill Russell.  Will, Bill Russell, Elgin Baylor, Oscar Robertson, Jerry West.  Damn.  That's my five.  Wow, really?  No Jordan?  No Abdul-Jabbar?  Yeah, what about, did you like Abdul-Jabbar, or did you just kind of get annoyed at the fact that he was just kind of flipping it because he was seven foot two?  Wow.  Tremendous respect for Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  That's an old school top five, though.  And tremendously annoyed by him.  Yeah.  I mean, I think certainly in terms of my personal recognition, although I'm not lacking any personal recognition, our eras overlapped. 
[02:39:00]  So, you know, I was somewhat in his shadow, like, great players like Clyde Drexler and others were in Michael's shadow.  Right.  But, you know, he was the guy, he was the main guy, and he cast a giant shadow.  Right.  No pun intended.  Right.  So, my two favorite growing up was Dr. J and Pete Maravich. 
[02:39:30]  Really?  Loved Pete Maravich.  Really?  Well, you got to find the missing tapes then.  What do you mean the missing tapes?  He and I did a show in New Orleans in the Superdome, and it was just the two of us in there with Dick Cavett.  Oh, wow.  And we put on a basketball demonstration.  You know, we played some one-on-one, and Pete showed some trick shots.  I showed some dunk shots.  And, you know, when Dick had the late-night show.  You guys can remember that, right? 
[02:40:00]  Yeah, as a matter of fact.  Yeah, of course, you were 13, 14 at the time.  Oh, there you go.  But that was it.  I've been looking for it, man.  I can't find it.  Can't find it.  We can probably find it for you.  It's kind of a half-hearted search, but I just remember that, and it was kind of special  because we were going to play the next night in the Superdome in front of the largest crowd  to ever witness an NBA game, and it was the New Orleans Jazz versus the Philadelphia 76ers.  So, it was my first year in Philadelphia, and Pete was still there. 
[02:40:30]  In New Orleans, the night before we did the show.  Wow.  Yeah.  Then we played the game the next night, and it was maybe like 36,000, 38,000.  Wow.  Which has been surpassed, but that was pretty big.  Sure.  That's a lot of people.  Back in the day, maybe like 1976, 77.  Then it turns out Pete Maravich was living his whole life with a piece of his heart missing.  That's how he died.  Oh, jeez.  Yeah.  You know.  Yeah.  You don't mean that metaphorically, do you, over a relationship? 
[02:41:00]  No.  He just...  I don't know exactly what it was, but he was missing something.  Yeah.  He had a heart attack after working out.  Yeah.  He was only 40.  Yeah.  Wow.  He was only 40.  Jeez.  Just retired a couple years in.  Yeah.  That was it, man.  It was sad.  A pickup game.  I believe.  He had some contact with his wife and his sons, and, you know, they'd come to All-Star Weekend,  and different things from time to time, and, you know, I actually, when I decided to 
[02:41:30]  move my memorabilia, and they had done that with Pete's, and Bob Cousy had done it, and  there were different places that had made those moves, and in terms of vetting different  auction houses, trying to find the right place to do the top-notch job, the classiest  job, get the most for it, and so on and so forth, you know, Pete's estate came up, and  it brought back some good memories.  We were actually teammates for a quick minute. 
[02:42:00]  You know, we were teammates with the Atlanta Hawks.  Wow.  For a training camp and two exhibition games.  And what a great experience it was, because I was trying to leave Virginia from the age  BBA and go to Atlanta, and I actually signed a contract with the Atlanta Hawks, and at  the time, they had Walt Bellamy, who was a Hall of Famer.  They had Lou Hudson, who was a Hall of Famer, Pete Maravich, who was a Hall of Famer, and 
[02:42:30]  I joined that team, went to training camp, Cotton Fitzsimmons was the coach, we went through  a complete training camp, played two exhibition games, whoever we played, we ran them off the  court, and the NBA stepped in and said that I was an illegal player for Atlanta, because  Atlanta didn't draft me, and Milwaukee had drafted me in the NBA, and if I played in the 
[02:43:00]  NBA, I had to go to Milwaukee.  Ugh.  So.  The NBA was stupid.  No.  People would have loved to see you and Pete Maravich on the same court?  So you went back to.  So I went back to Virginia.  You went back to Virginia for.  The Squires, it was Virginia Squires, right?  For a second year, went back, this was after my rookie year, went back to Virginia for a  second year, and then, and then I was traded to New York, and the move was made to keep  me in the league, because they knew after two years in Virginia, I was going to move on, 
[02:43:30]  because Atlanta was still fighting and trying to get me, and it was either going to be Atlanta  or Milwaukee.  Milwaukee, so to appease me and my agent, I got, my contract was sold to the Nets, and  you know, and then that was a different story, and three years with the Nets were great, we  won two championships in the ABA, Atlanta became a distant memory, and Milwaukee never  happened.  Right.  And you contacted his, and the family kind of helped you with the estate when you had to 
[02:44:00]  do the auction, so you kind of at least knew that they were people whose judgment you  could kind of trust.  Yeah, they were in the mix in terms of giving some advice, and you know, and I pretty much  I read what had transpired there, and you know, that helped me to be, make more of an  informed decision.  What was the hardest piece to let go?  I know it's all probably very difficult, because it's all got an emotional attachment, but of  all of them, which was the one you were like, oh God, I hate to see that?  I probably, well, I didn't auction off my Hall of Fame ring. 
[02:44:30]  And I'm going to keep that in the family.  And the 50 Greatest Players is in the auction, but it wasn't featured in the first auction,  the first leg, so that's still...  Just thinking you have to do that.  That's still mine.  And then my 83 ring, that probably was the one that I had worn the most, but I had stopped  wearing it, and you know, suddenly I looked at all the stuff and said, you know, everything 
[02:45:00]  here is pretty much in storage and put away, so there's a better place for it than there.  You know, because in terms of the accomplishments, it doesn't take away from the accomplishments.  You still did what you did, and people remember it as they want to remember it, so it was never  my calling card.  And it was well thought through.  I mean, it was planned for over a year before we executed it in October and November. 
[02:45:30]  And I'm pretty pleased.  You were surprised?  I'm very pleased with the results.  I mean, there's this...  You know, it was an outpouring.  Oh, yeah.  It was a huge response in terms of the collectors out there.  And so even now, you know, it's a driving force in terms of what I'm doing with my brand.  It's an acknowledgment that I still have a brand.  Right.  You know, everybody can't say that.  Yeah.  Hey, you also got an Xbox game you're going to be featured in? 
[02:46:00]  Yeah, yeah.  NBA 2K12.  2K2012.  Yeah, I'm one of the big players in there.  Yeah, I got Magic, Larry, Michael Jordan, and Dr. J.  Exactly.  Gamers can select...  You play horse?  That's all I would do.  I have no idea.  I'd be like, what?  Horse, I know how to play that.  Everybody knows you play 515, right? 
[02:46:30]  But now you've got three-on-three, one-on-one.  You've got a horse game.  You've got the legends playing the current players, so you can mix and match.  And then you've got various stages that you can get to which would release certain features.  Right.  And if those features get released, then it's a more meaningful experience.  Now, I'm not a gamer, but I'm somewhat knowledgeable in terms of what goes on because I have young children. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, yeah.  So I have one teenager in the house and then two pre-teenagers in the house.  Did you see the character?  Does it look like you?  It does.  You know, he's probably a little thicker.  Yeah.  He's a little thicker than I was back then, but he's probably as thick as I am now.  When the legends play the current players, did the legends have their short shorts on?  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  I don't know how you kept...  You got the short shorts and you got the high socks. 
[02:47:30]  I don't know how you guys kept it all in those shorts.  I don't know what the hell that was about, man.  Well, you know, we used to wear jockstraps.  The shorts came all over the air.  Now it's like you wear the spandex and you probably don't have to wear a jockstrap.  No.  You got spandex and you got the long shorts and probably some shorts underneath.  Like MJ used to always wear his North Carolina shorts underneath because he was superstitious.  But we had, you know, we were weaned on wearing jockstraps.  Can I say how great...  That's why they called them jocks. 
[02:48:00]  Opie just asked Dr. J, why didn't your penis fall out?  Well, that's a compliment.  Right?  That's assuming that he has a big one.  He actually said it was hard to keep it in.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's what he actually said.  That's the greatest question.  You got to do a lot of paraphrasing.  Yeah.  I like to think one of my favorite basketball players of all time is, you know, fucking Hulk.  Yeah, you always want to think of your heroes as packing.  That's right, all right.  Unless you're a Kurt Rambis fan. 
[02:48:30]  We never understood the short shorts, though.  And when you see those old clips, it makes me howl, man.  They changed the whole look.  Michael Cooper is the last guy I can remember wearing the high socks.  Yeah, the high socks.  I can't remember anybody doing it.  That was a little bit before I watched.  Yeah.  And James Worthy I liked a lot, too, because he and I have certain, you know, behavioral  things with the ladies that are very similar.  So I always kind of liked James Worthy.  Any of the kids have skills?  Any of your children?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, you know, I have a daughter who's a tennis player.  I have a son who, well, he boxes as a hobby, but he did have one professional fight. 
[02:49:00]  Wow.  And he was kind of encouraged to get in the ring professionally by his son.  And he took on the challenge and he trained and he had one fight, which was a first round  KO of his opponent.  Oh, good.  I was going to say.  Wow.  Yeah.  And now my 13-year-old, my 10-year-old, they've gone crazy about basketball. 
[02:49:30]  They are?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So the 13-year-old looks like he's got the skill set to be a pretty good player.  And the 10-year-old really tries hard and he tries to imitate Derrick Rose, which is  really hard for anybody to do, much less a 10-year-old.  But that's his man, so I don't know how it happened.  Do they realize how?  We shall see.  We shall see how this plays out.  But do they realize how great you were?  Yeah.  Do they realize that you are who you are or are you just dad?  Like, all right, dad, I got it.  Yeah, all right, dad.  I'm going to watch LeBron shut up. 
[02:50:00]  That would drive me nuts.  They came around this year, but the previous years, it was not a whole lot happening and  we weren't pushing it.  Right.  You know, I was done, I mean, I've been done for 27 years on the court, so, you know, they  got the YouTube stuff and there's video and now, obviously, with 2K12, you know, there's  action and they can see me and what I used to do, but, you know, it's not the calling 
[02:50:30]  card.  I mean, I don't have a house full of things, reminders, you know, we move on.  Did you do that on purpose?  Because it's kind of hard to see it when you do that.  Somewhat, somewhat.  And then combined with the fact that my wife is from Honduras, so, you know, she didn't  grow up with basketball.  It was more like soccer like you're smart.  Yeah.  It was more like soccer and the house is bilingual.  So, the basketball thing, it's kept in, it's compartmentalized. 
[02:51:00]  Right.  You know.  Do you remember when you decided to finally, like, I'm always amazed with athletes because  it's very hard to actually go, okay, I have to move on in my life.  And, like, did you decide to do it or did the team say, look, we're not going to have you  anymore?  Or did you go, look, it's just time to move on?  How old are you?  43.  I look terrific.  43.  Yeah.  So, I retired in 87, which made you what?  87.  I was just getting sober.  I was 21. 
[02:51:30]  21.  All right.  So, you're probably old enough to remember 87.  Sure, sure.  And, actually, there was a very elaborate farewell tour in 87 when I quit because I had  announced prior to that season that this was it.  And all the teams in the league celebrated my leaving the league.  And it really was a great farewell tour.  And it gave me a lot of presents, you know, everything from rocking chairs to automobiles to...  Golf clubs, probably.  Yeah, yeah.  The Suns gave me golf clubs. 
[02:52:00]  They did.  So, it was a great farewell tour.  And it was saying goodbye.  And that made it official.  So, then there was no hope of coming back the next year.  That'd be embarrassing.  And I think the only one that I can remember that happening to was John Havlicek.  And John is a friend.  And it was pretty special.  And mine was actually probably bigger than his.  And since that time, I haven't seen one farewell tour that even came close. 
[02:52:30]  Do you remember the last time you walked off, like, knowing, like, this is the last time  I'm ever going to walk off the court as an active player?  Yep.  It's on YouTube.  Oh, it is?  Okay.  It's on YouTube.  It says Dr. J's last two minutes.  Last shot I made was a three-pointer.  And I wasn't known for three-point shooting.  But the last shot I made was a three-pointer.  We played the Milwaukee Bucks in game five of a first-round playoff series, which was best of five. 
[02:53:00]  And they won two.  It was 2-2.  And we played the last game in Milwaukee.  And we lost.  And they showed the last two minutes of that game.  And the, you know, the substitution.  Because all the other players, all the other starters came out before me.  And then I came out last.  And, you know, went to the sidelines.  And, you know, everybody came over. 
[02:53:30]  And that was the last game.  Right.  Officially, that was the last game.  It was against the Bucks in Milwaukee.  And they were great rivals.  They had great teams.  And we always just got by a little bit until that last year.  They sent me packing, baby.  That was it.  That was it.  That was a moment.  Yeah, yeah.  I guess it helps.  You were only 21.  You didn't care.  No, I did, though.  But I was just getting off of drugs at that time.  I was just getting sober.  So I was kind of not focused on sports. 
[02:54:00]  Okay.  No.  But what did Abdul-Jabbar retire that year?  And was it a little bit later, a few years later?  He hung around another couple years.  Because I remember his last.  His is the only one I remember.  It was in Detroit after, you know, a sweep by the Pistons.  But even the Pistons gave him a stand.  Like, you know, everybody.  Yeah.  Well, you have to.  Pay homage, sure.  Obviously.  Yeah.  So I guess that last time you walk off is a rough one.  No, I was relieved.  You were ready to go?  Yeah, a couple skeletons in the closet and, you know, just things that were complicated. 
[02:54:30]  And leaving actually made it less complicated.  As a matter of fact, uncomplicated.  Because, you know, I wasn't.  When I left, I really didn't view myself as being a public person because of where I was employed.  You know, I was now independent.  I was an independent contractor.  I could do whatever the hell I wanted to do.  If I want to sleep all day, I can just sleep all day.  You know, so the whole routine of representing an organization, representing your club, representing your city. 
[02:55:00]  All right.  You know, you're always representing yourself and representing your family.  But it was like reeling it in and saying, no, I just have to represent myself and my family.  I don't have to answer to the media.  I don't have to answer to the critics.  And, you know, like you're sitting here all that time and there's a brick sitting there waiting to hit you upside the head.  So now the brick was gone, you know.  It was gone.  And I was like, oh, man, this is kind of nice.  It was such a relief during that time. 
[02:55:30]  So when you say it's hard.  That makes sense.  It was easy.  Now to stay away, to stay away from it and not, you know, the whole godfather syndrome because you're married to us for life.  Yeah.  So it's been very, it's been by selection that I've participated in things related to basketball.  You know, I was out for, from 87 to 90, 96.  And then I went back into basketball. 
[02:56:00]  I went to work for the Orlando Magic for six years.  And I was a senior executive for six years and, you know, had the feeling come back.  They made me somewhat of an offer I couldn't refuse.  I took it.  And, but in the 27 years, not a whole lot of it has been basketball driven.  You know, I think the platform is there.  The forum is there.  But there's been no dependency on it, on anything associated with basketball, which has been good. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah.  It's been, it's been pretty, it's been pretty cool.  Was there something that you wanted to do or were doing during that time that you were like, oh boy, if, you know, if they catch on to this, I'm going to get in trouble.  And because you said like that brick was, was taken away.  Yeah.  You mentioned skeletons.  Well, yeah, I did.  I mean, you know, I had a daughter out of wedlock and she lived.  Damn.  Yeah.  Was that a, was actually a, was that, was that a big deal?  I guess back then maybe it was a little different than now where it's, it's not, it was probably less common. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah.  She's the tennis player.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Alexandria.  Alexandria.  Alexandria.  Did all right in tennis.  Alexandria was born in 80.  And so when I left in 87, so she was, she was seven at the time.  And so it wasn't a public issue.  It wasn't really a public issue.  Right.  She was 17 when she went to Wimbledon and, you know, made it to the quarter.  So that's when it became a public issue. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah.  So, so, you know, that was one of the things that was a relief.  That was probably the most major thing.  Yeah.  It does seem like one of those things where, uh, when you got this, this, what I see as a fake morality thing that goes on with a lot of these, uh, leagues and, um, you just got to adhere to their rules.  It just seems like, uh, very taxing on your life.  Yeah.  It wasn't just league.  I mean, it's just society, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're being held up.  It's society wide.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, at least in, in the U.S. 
[02:58:00]  But the U.S. is obviously the, uh, bastion of forgiveness.  You know, once there's transparency, once it's all out.  Yeah.  The only option is to forgive and move on.  Mm-hmm.  Case in point, right?  Right.  You know?  Um, so, I mean, I didn't know that at the time.  Mm-hmm.  I said, you keep it a secret as long as you can.  You don't have to lie about it, but you don't have to talk about it.  Yeah.  And then, uh, you know, once it's out, yeah, this happened, what, what's the next question? 
[02:58:30]  Yeah, man.  It's got to be hard to resist the women, though, in that, and especially when you're, you're the guy.  I mean, I, I can't resist them now and I'm a nobody.  Like, like, if, if you're the guy that every beautiful woman wants, it's got to be very difficult to say no to.  You don't want to sit in a city?  Yeah, everywhere you go, every hot woman likes you.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Is that fun?  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha! 
[02:59:00]  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  And, uh, I, I, I didn't know anything, but there were a lot of women around, and they wanted  to teach me.  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Information didn't get passed as quick back then either, so you could probably do a little  bit more, like today, everything gets twittered, and on a cell phone, and a camera, and back  then it was just word of mouth, so it would take a little longer.  They didn't even have shock jock reporting, did they? 
[02:59:30]  Ha!  Ha!  No, no.  No, man, everyone...  It was just reporting, you know, this was pre-ESPN.  Well, you talk to a lot of old school guys, they said a lot, they knew a lot of this stuff  was going on, but they just didn't report it.  Plus there was a rule, you know, what goes on in the road stays on the road.  Right.  That was kind of like the rule back in the day, so...  Now, forget about it.  Dated myself a little bit, the 70s, now everything's on blast, and, you know, twittered, Facebook-y.  And everybody's looking to just uncover the next scandal, so they're all out there with 
[03:00:00]  their phones, and...  You know, the irony of that is that things get knocked off the headlines so quickly because  something else comes.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, like you're going down the road, and, you know, it's Michael Jackson's doctor's...  Yeah.  ...on trial, and then something comes up, and then I don't hear anything about it anymore.  Yeah, that's gone, and then...  I'm like, what happened to Dr. Curry or...  Tyrad Murray.  Yeah.  Penn State happened to him.  Dr. Murray, what happened?  Yeah, Penn State.  Penn State happened to him. 
[03:00:30]  You know?  Yeah, that is.  It's just, we jump from one...  Jump from one to whatever the hot one is.  ...scandal to the next.  Whatever the hot one is.  Unless it's a slow news day.  Oh.  Yeah.  Then you bring back an old one, right?  Oh boy, nothing worse than a slow news day.  We like to...  The public likes to stomp on something, and when it's completely flattened, we'll just  take another peek at it, and then go onto something else that could really use a good stomping.  Yeah.  That's what it feels like with stuffing.  We really don't have much of an attention span.  Why is that, guys?  You guys are on the media side.  Why is that?  Is that just...  People's...  Is there pressure from other sources that... 
[03:01:00]  Who has to get it first?  We're just nosy.  Whoever gets it first is the best.  I think it started because it's...  They're like an evaluation quarterly.  I think it started with competition.  Competition's right.  Yeah, if you got that story, they're gonna be looking at your...  Your TV program or radio show a little more, right?  And it's 24 hours of news, 24-hour sports channels.  They have to talk about something.  They gotta fill up that time.  I don't think we have the ability to watch anything longer than a couple of minutes these  days either.  It really is amazing. 
[03:01:30]  Everything's just been whittled down, yeah.  It's got to shoot fast, and it's sound bites.  Yeah, everything's been whittled down to sound bites.  Whereas, you know, years ago, you would sit there and actually watch in a complete newscast  with Walter Cronkite.  And, you know, now it's a quick, you know, another...  Fox News alert!  Here it is!  It's like, really?  Ah!  I feel like something's happening every two seconds.  And they try to shove that down your throat.  Yeah, and before you used to, you know, get a chance to realize how you feel about it. 
[03:02:00]  Mm.  You know?  Because, I mean, you would absorb it.  And you'd say, hmm, how do I feel about this?  And then you might have a conversation with somebody who's with you or call somebody up.  Yeah, because another 10 things weren't being thrown at you.  You can't do that now.  Nah.  It's like, I don't feel anything.  It's just like, I got hit.  Yeah, yeah.  And then it's gone.  It's gone, something else is on me.  Yeah.  And then when you get ready to go and convey it to somebody, you're really not that informed.  No.  You've already got the shock aspect of it.  You've already got like a bite that this happened. 
[03:02:30]  Everyone knows the headline, but no one knows the story.  Nobody knows the story.  You ask that second question to anyone and they fall apart.  Everyone this time.  Because we're all just repeating what we just heard.  All right, all right.  Yeah, we're one question away from being an idiot.  What do you mean by that?  All right, well, I...  Well, they didn't tell me that part.  It starts with, hey, did you hear?  Right.  Oh, really?  Well, what happened with...  I don't know.  I just heard it.  I don't know.  Something like that.  It was something like that.  Yeah, it was something like that.  I don't know.  It was something like that. 
[03:03:00]  God, that is odd.  And you're right.  Nobody, you don't process it anymore.  You say what you think you should say.  So-and-so cheated on his wife.  Ah, that's terrible.  You don't feel terrible about it.  You don't feel terrible.  You just say it's terrible.  No, you don't have the details.  Yeah.  And you might never get the details.  Right, no.  Years ago when you heard, and that's the way it was, you got to sit down and go,  Oh, yeah.  Hmm.  What the fuck did he just say?  Let me process this.  Yeah.  The reason for that, you had to get up and change the channel.  Yeah.  Who the fuck wants to get up so you'll sit through whatever's on TV?  Yeah.  It's just like click, click, click, click, click, click, click. 
[03:03:30]  Ah, there's newfangled devices, Hopi.  Yeah.  We're dating ourselves.  So two guys went to my high school.  That's a small class.  Yeah.  And one was five years behind me, and the other was ten.  So the guy who was ten years behind me was Eddie Murphy.  Wow.  The guy who was five years behind me was Howard Stern.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  What's that one?  Roosevelt.  Roosevelt, right? 
[03:04:00]  Roosevelt.  Wow, damn.  I'm just throwing that out there.  I didn't know you guys.  I know you guys don't know a lot about me.  Well, you know what?  You could have stopped that a lot.  You're right.  We don't know a lot.  My high school, Mariah Carey.  There you go.  I like that.  All right.  My high school on Wikipedia, Jim Norton.  Jim Norton is number one.  Is the number one name out of my high school.  Yes.  Who is that, by the way?  Exactly.  It's me.  Who's that?  Who's Jim Norton?  He's 100%.  That's exactly what his reaction should have been. 
[03:04:30]  Who?  What's a Norton?  Yeah, this helped me out with that one.  Yeah.  I heard of Ken Norton.  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  Did he go to your high school?  He did not, no.  He was a man's man.  Ken Norton knew how to hit.  Yes, he did.  Holy.  Wow.  He's a great football player, too.  Great defensive player.  That's true.  That's right.  He's not playing anymore?  Kenny Jr.  No.  He's out?  No, but I know that he was a cowboy, and that was when the Cowboys got the salary caps.  That was the first dynasty to be broken up, and one of the losses was Kenny Jr.  He's probably 50 now, right?  Really?  Kenny Jr's 50?  Holy. 
[03:05:00]  Wow, wow, wow.  I didn't take a wild guess, so don't hold me to that.  Probably close.  So I guess we should plug the game.  Absolutely.  This is what Dr. J is here for.  What else are you doing today?  Doing more of this?  Yeah, we're going to do some more.  We're going to try and give it a shot, put it on blast.  It's already out.  It came out in October, so everybody's already planned it.  Cool.  I guess you've got to buy it at retail, and then you can download additional things online.  That'll put it on steroids, make it more better, as they say. 
[03:05:30]  But it's a hot game, man.  It's a hot game.  Are you made by?  I'm not a gamer or whatever, but there are people my age and your age and your age and  your age who play and play religiously.  There are some, like when I watch TV now and I watch some movies, there's always like  the conflict between the wife and the gamer. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I was watching this one flick, man, where she like picked it up and smashed it, and  he just like sat there.  He was in shock.  That was shock reporting right there.  So it's pretty intense, man.  It could get to be addictive.  Yeah.  And the graphics are so realistic these days.  I've actually clicked on things online that were like UFC fights or boxing matches.  I didn't know it occurred.  And I'm like an asshole.  I opened it, and I realized it's a computer fight.  But that's how good the graphics are, these sports games are, yeah. 
[03:06:30]  Yep.  It's a part of our society.  Yeah.  NBA 2K12.  2K12.  And you can play the Legends, obviously Dr. J and Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, and Jordan,  and it's the Legends Showcase.  And you go to get the downloadable content, and you can get it now.  It's for Xbox and PS3.  Very cool.  Absolutely.  Dr. J.  Thank you so much for coming.  Thanks, man.  Good job.  Absolutely.  Very cool.  We'll do it rolling.  Yeah.  We will attempt. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah.  Thanks, man.  All right.  Thank you, everyone.  Yeah.  Sirius XM.  This is the opening entry show.  Oh, my God.  That was cool.  I haven't really talked about it much on the show, but he was someone I idolized growing  up, Dr. J.  Yeah?  Fuck yeah.  It was him, Pete Maravich, and I think the list pretty much ends there.  My fucking dad would bring us to the Nets games.  Dr. J.  was on the New York Nets.  I told him after the interview that I saw him at the NASA Coliseum, and usually, as 
[03:07:30]  soon as I said that, I'm like, why would he fucking care?  But he was surprised, because, you know, they used to play ABA basketball out there on Long  Island.  I saw a game or two out there.  And I...  Pops used to have to take us places, because he had us for the weekend.  Something.  You want to hear something really gi?  What's gay?  Dr. J.  So I'm like 12, 13 years old, trying to figure out, like, this fucking life after death shit,  and I'm driving with my dad, who's now gone, and I asked him what heaven was like. 
[03:08:00]  And he goes, in heaven, you could dunk the ball like Dr. J.  Boy, that's a pretty fucked up...  Premise?  Yeah.  It's like you go through all this shit, and that's all you get?  Being able to dunk a ball.  Exactly.  It's like the Nets are lower, so everyone can do it.  But, you know, I mean, basketball was my world back then, so he...  My dad was explaining heaven in basketball terms.  He basically was saying, look, in heaven, you pretty much could do whatever the fuck you want. 
[03:08:30]  You could dunk the ball like Dr. J.  I forgot to bring that up to him, but he probably wouldn't look at me and say that.  You little faggot.  You could dunk the ball like Dr. J.  Well, I hope dad is dunking the ball right now.  Oh, God.  And they're showing the last minute of his career.  Yeah, I remember this.  No, it's weird.  I'm kind of depressed because, like I said, I idolized him growing up,  to think that he's selling his shit at 61 years old.  Either he's rationalized it really well or he really doesn't put that kind of importance in symbolic things. 
[03:09:00]  He doesn't want to...  Nobody wants to sell their rings.  He doesn't want to be selling his shit.  Obviously, rumor has it was a bank loan that went bad.  It could be some kind of bankruptcy.  I don't know.  The banks, man!  I didn't feel like pushing him on it.  No.  I mean, when you're selling your 19...  What was it?  83 and 1974 championship rings.  That's fucking...  It hurts me.  Yeah.  They're not my fucking rings.  But a guy like him, it's a little easier at least because at least he's royalty in sports. 
[03:09:30]  Anywhere he goes, he's royalty.  Like, a player who wasn't nearly as well-known who just retired, that's gotta really suck.  At least he can go anywhere and...  He's talking about the last two minutes of his career, but you can see it on his face.  He's like, holy fuck, it's all coming to an end right here.  We're looking at the clip on YouTube.  It's last minute of Julius Irving's NBA game.  And the other thing, as we get to the end of this video...  His wife's from Honduras, so she doesn't even probably fully understand how huge he was. 
[03:10:00]  That bothers me.  It might be the last one you ever see, Dr. J. Strong drive to a flip.  There's the flip.  Funny when he said he went from the dunk to the flip.  He was joking about it, but he knew how to flip at the end of his career.  Yeah.  And then the finger roll.  The finger roll.  Is his hair going gray at that point?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He literally has the biggest hands I've ever seen in a community.  They're giant hands!  That's how you handle a ball so well.  It's like...  Oh, yeah.  I remember this where his hair was grayer. 
[03:10:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Maybe in another minute, 11 seconds, it gets grayer.  And I just made the great point, Dr. J has big hands.  That's why I'm in this business.  I notice everything.  It was odd when he shook our hands, though, when he came in, because it's just a giant hand.  It reminded me of Animal House.  It's a, you mind if we dance with your dates?  Oh, yeah.  And he grabs that girl's hand.  Mm-hmm.  And I got a rare autograph today, Jim.  You see?  Yes, you did. 
[03:11:00]  And a picture.  And a picture.  My camera sucks.  Thank God for E-Rock.  I've never thought that or said it before, and I'll never say it again.  But that camera he has is great.  Oh, no.  42 seconds left in Dr. J's career.  E-Rock...  Oh, this is it right here?  E-Rock saving that clip of you saying that, by the way.  He was fucking huge, man.  Do people understand how big Dr. J was?  I hope they do.  Six.  Oh.  Number six.  See, it was a joke. 
[03:11:30]  He's that big.  He's that big.  Physically.  Yeah, yeah.  There he is.  He's just walking off to the...  Yeah.  Hugging the white people, you know, the coaches and owners back then.  Yeah.  Oh, that's right.  Doc.  I forgot they called him Doc.  Mm-hmm.  Really?  Why did I forget that?  Doc.  Doesn't look much different today.  No.  Where did he get his mustache today?  Where did he get his PhD?  I was going to say that.  On the basketball court, Ant.  Ah! 
[03:12:00]  He was very nice.  I liked him.  Yeah.  Some people didn't dig it.  Whatever.  Who didn't even tell.  Frasier was nice, too, with this guy.  Yeah.  I like when the athletes were nice.  What can he do in heaven, Opie?  Because he already could dunk like Dr. J.  Uh, probably do math.  You think do math.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Cause those people, yeah.  Fucking Dr. J.  It's it for J.  And I asked him how he kept his cock in his shorts.  Yeah.  That was right, I wanted to clarify what that question was.  I know.  I was trying to be careful about that.  I was trying to be careful about that.  Oh, of course. 
[03:12:30]  That's tough.  He was trying to be careful.  But he's just trying to be careful.  Yeah.  And he's trying to be careful in his shorts.  Cool.  That's interesting.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  know i try to be careful how do you keep your cock in your your short shorts and that's it  to walk off to a loss sucks he's hugging the ref milwaukee won that game again i just threw 10 bucks  on it with mars ah how much you think he sold that basketball for that he's walking off the  court with ah game ball last game yeah i should i should have i should have gave him my number 
[03:13:00]  he said look if you're selling any other ship you got 450 000 that's some uh that's some expensive  you're selling get that ring i don't see no rang  a curtain call all the players want to come hug one for the other team oh yeah trying to think where he 
[03:13:30]  i think he oh okay fifth highest score in basketball history i don't know he's that  high on the list oh fuck yeah 30 000 abdul jabbar jordan is too well the problem is with dr j they  combined the aba nba thing okay so where's he on the nba list i thought dr dre was coming in today  no as long as it's not as long as it's not i was glad dr j didn't go you have to dribble because 
[03:14:00]  what happens is when you have long fingers sometimes you can palm the ball and hold it back you gotta run  down the court but a lot of times you can just kind of stand there dunk it that's not dr j that's  dr ass yeah exactly that's dr jo you know dr jo uh gonna get some flute on the ball make it slippery  he's number 30 on the nba list but the nba they probably should have combined it right i mean 
[03:14:30]  he was a professional some some would say it was an inferior league so oh easier to score and blah  blah blah then that's like taking baseball players out when they didn't have blacks playing because  they didn't have the same level of of hitters to face you know what i mean it's like you got to just  take it for what it was right i forgot about that yeah i forgot that irving and uh maravich almost  played together yeah people are appreciating uh fan opi today i couldn't help myself no you were great  man i didn't know much about basketball i was trying to i was trying to stay calm he's he's 
[03:15:00]  fuck well because you know it comes up every once in a while who would get make you really nervous if  they came in here there you go there's mine i forgot all about dr j because he kind of went away  the guy went away would you go out to dinner if you could oh yeah yeah we talked pretty it was pretty  cool after the after the the interview yeah he was talking and very friendly i had to ask him to leave  please yeah doc please leave out what a nice man yeah i just like when athletes are nice he's  beyond nice and you did you hear only like two or three years he made over a million that you know 
[03:15:30]  how crazy that is yeah scrubs are making way more than that now he's probably didn't know who jim  norton was i think we were all a little shocked and hurt at that how perfect who's that exactly sir  exactly the question all of show business has been asking who and why is jim here  why is he here exactly why is this moderately successful idiot fucking walking around like  he's the real bell of the ball bell of the ball oh fucking jimmy oh yeah um if you follow the stall 
[03:16:00]  seat ny on twitter stall with two l's they got that hockey fight we sort of mentioned oh oh yeah  it's hilarious i i don't know anything about the cfl but i guess it was an ugly hit 48 years ago and  they the one guy never they they hate each other and they uh appeared at a banquet together and uh the  one guy came over with a little flower to say hey let's chill on this whole thing and the other guy

[03:21:00]  have though ivan putzky i would hope so at some point yeah you this this was haystack calhouns maybe  this is one of the territorial guys uh nine he was never in the wwf oh he wasn't no i see his uh  favorite move there was the heart punch yes look out later taken by crush yes who is no  longer with us the elbow drop was his finishing move and the sleeper hold did you say the heart  punch yeah that reminds me how is owen hart doing how is he well i think we all know that owen hart 
[03:21:30]  died in an accident in the ring oh god that's right several years oh that was the year uh vince  canceled wrestlemania i remember that clearly like it was oh no no vince man has thing and uh  why would he cancel he canceled wrestlemania that wouldn't make any sense the show goes on  yeah he didn't cancel not only did he not cancel wrestlemania he didn't cancel the pay-per-view  that it took place on wow continued the show he had a main event to get to i'd love to know what  the threats were behind the curtain yeah you get the hell out there you get out there jeff 
[03:22:00]  jared came out for his man you fall on the ground right away it's sop ups over that blood oh god  they didn't even change the mat no i'm sure they changed no they didn't i remember this like it was  fucking yesterday there was a big red spot in the there was not yep yep eric helped me out  i don't think they changed the mat they went to the dark side of the arena for a while then did a vignette  and then jr said he you know they changed the mat three or four times a show regardless of whether 
[03:22:30]  somebody's fallen or not i'm sure they changed the mat they changed the mat in every show sam i know  you're a rah-rah guy but why didn't they cancel that's creepy because in the moment that's  fucking creep they knew he was not gonna live no they knew that i mean he pretty much died instantly  they pronounced him dead before the main event but oh my god nice what a buzz kill in the moment  it's really it's a buzz kill you got a lot of fans who paid a lot of money to go see the show 
[03:23:00]  a lot of fans paid a lot of money on pay-per-view where's everyone going i did this for you you get  back in this arena i did this for you we're gonna have wrestlemania i don't care if every goddamn  wrestler dies that didn't happen at wrestlemania or whatever it is it's over the edge over the  edge oh what's wrestlemania what a coincidence it was just one of their big pay-per-views when  pay-per-views mattered when he didn't do as many as they do now right he's making more money now  though uh the pay-per-views don't matter i mean back then wasn't it once every three months uh sam 
[03:23:30]  four four and then five pay-per-views a year back then yeah yeah yeah now it's what one every three  weeks yeah it's probably like 13 to 14 a year jesus yeah that's crazy that's not special that's  stupid making a guy get that paper hey it's still real to me right thank god for you that's all i  need to tell you where did jimmy go still real to me he took off why i think he's recording with  troy or something oh do we are we done with live reads can we go home well i'm in well where's well 
[03:24:00]  let me let me see something you want to just i'm not i don't do live reads i just like talking about  you're like riffing i just like talking certain things i i have a passion for and one of those things  of course is uh brookstone yeah yeah yeah uh you know someone with an ipad of course you do how  much they love it and they're always looking for new things to do with it uh now at brookstone  they got uh this new thing it's a rover wireless spy tank wow really oh yeah what what does that have 
[03:24:30]  to do with the ipad well it's absolutely the coolest thing to go with the ipad this year the rover  it looks like an alien tank from out of space and you could steer it remotely all over your house using  your ipad your iphone or your ip touch yes it streams live video and sound back to the screen  so you can drive it around corners chase the dog spying everyone in the building it captures digital  photos even has night vision so you could steer it around in the dark and see what's going on 
[03:25:00]  uh as the rover drives around it really looks like it's got a mind of its own too because uh you're  driving it yes you are remotely using your ipad or other uh uh i device it can uh really freak people  out the rover's wireless it's uh the rover wireless spy tank only at brookstone it's what the ipad really  wants for this uh holiday season test driver over today in any brookstone store and see the video  at brookstone.com uh i just went on my twitter and and uh vince mcmahon went dark for 10 minutes oh 
[03:25:30]  well they had this guy was at the show the fuck is it for the show for the show for the show  i was there it's a speedo bump on twitter i was there maybe 10 minutes of dark time and then it was  let's start uh fighting again i mean they cleared him out of the ring and they figured out what was  going on and then they oh started the next and they figured what the hell we're all here who cares  if one of us is dead it was it was they wanted to give the fans their money's worth we call it off 
[03:26:00]  it ain't bringing them back right all right vince thanks the hell they wanted to make sure the fans  got the show that they think of it this way a little more room in the in the locker room oh yeah  that's it's a perk you gotta take lemons and make a lemonade that's what i do yay fell what of it  bring on the rest of the schmucks they're not schmucks he doesn't think they're schmucks 
[03:26:30]  uh he probably does i doubt it and in the end bret bret hart uh you know understood yeah well i mean  everybody you know bret hart is doing well now that was the main event 98 yes it was uh  stone cold steve austin versus dude love so they still had to dude love that's uh mcfoley yeah  the dude love intro was so bad it was a horrible green screen thing it was great where uh dude love  was walking around and he had his uh at one point he was flying he was flying yes dude love flew

[03:27:30]  they gave him 70s bg music yeah it doesn't make sense it makes no sense why is he tapping his foot  like that to the beat he's doing the thumbs up playing in vegas yeah what is that it has nothing  to do with a hippie this is horrible dude love dude love one of mcfoley's characters it stinks he's the  king of green screen i do dude love it's so bad some good green screening i still have my dude love  shirt he's dancing you wish your green screen looked this good yes all right you gotta start

[03:31:00]  just try one i'm never gonna eat anything matt's mom is the cookie making champion all right  gotta give it to her she is not oh boy your mom she's just not sam try one you're gonna change  your mind sam your mom is the overall baking champion okay she's got the title but like wrestling you  don't have that they have the lesser belts so she's matt's mom is the official television champion  of baking no tried to give me a chocolate chip one and there was fucking peanut butter in it what's  that you're allergic to peanut butter what a fucking no i hate peanut butter you like 
[03:31:30]  peanut butter buys peanut butter chocolate chip cookie doesn't have peanut butter in it no it's a  nice twist no it's not it's not supposed to it's supposed to be chocolate chip cookies it's a  peanut butter chocolate chocolate chip you should present it as such i hate you're lucky you're lucky  he likes peanut butter if he didn't like peanut butter and we all know why aunt doesn't like peanuts  Why?  Oh, because the black man.  Invented the peanut.  Because those people, you know, might have invented a thing or two.  That's a good boy. 
[03:32:00]  Sam, cookie champion.  He's not the cookie champion because my mom's cookies are better.  Cookie making champion right here.  These are good, man.  Your mom rules.  No.  Thank you.  Did you yell, Mom, you got to make cookies for the guys so I can be popular?  Because I need more attention.  The only time I ever get air time is when they tell me how bad I suck.  Yeah, could you just get me, make some cookies, Mommy, please?  I can't get by doing good work because it actually takes energy and work ethic.  I don't have any of that.  They don't notice me for my work ethic, so could you make cookies, Mommy? 
[03:32:30]  Maybe your mom should have raised you instead.  She did a very nice job raising me.  She did a horrible job.  She did a very, very good job.  Your mom's stinking job.  Your mom's cookies are needy like you.  Look how many chips have to be in the package.  Look how many chips have to be in there.  Love me.  You like chocolate?  Sure, maybe I should have had another ten chips.  Another ten full per cookie.  No idea what she's doing in the kitchen.  She tends to go overboard, but they did come out very, very good.  Now we know where you got it from.  Exactly.  Can you wrap up a few of these for home base? 
[03:33:00]  Sure, sure.  How many do you want?  Don't subject your wife and child.  They're amazing cookies.  You know what happens?  If you bring these cookies home, you're letting intern Matt into your home.  Yeah, by proxy.  Yeah.  You're letting him.  Cookie making champion, Sam.  Yeah, right.  Not overall champion.  Relax, Mom.  He still has that.  Divisional title?  Yeah, but my mom's cookies are better than that.  It's kind of like the Intercontinental Belt.  We don't know that because she's never baked a cookie for us.  She has.  You've eaten them.  Oh, then prove my point. 
[03:33:30]  Matt's mom better.  No, Matt's mom isn't better.  Plus, at cookie making she is at this point.  That's right.  At this point because it's the only thing in front of you.  I give out the titles.  It's the only thing in front of you.  That's the only reason you're picking it.  I'm eating one.  I'm telling you, these cookies are fucking phenomenal.  Yeah?  They're cookies.  I'm sure they're just cookies.  I've got to be honest.  Cookies are just fucking, you smash them on a damn sheet and put them in the oven.  What's wrong with you?  There's different cookies there?  These are delicious.  Yeah, but they're not that hard to make.  They're not. 
[03:34:00]  There's a different kind of cookie.  I think she made like three or four kinds.  You don't even know because she didn't present them well.  This is dog shit.  Did she make it from scratch or did she just like do that Pillsbury shit?  No, no.  These are from scratch.  They're not from scratch.  Yes, they are.  These are absolutely from scratch.  Where did she get the recipe from?  The back of the box they came on.  I don't know where she did, but she spent all day Saturday doing this.  She's very excited about it.  First of all, they're in cupcake wrappers.  They're cookies in cupcake wrappers.  I think she wanted to make it look very nice and presentable.  I love when Sam said defend mom mode.  I think they very much do.  And regardless, it's the taste of it. 
[03:34:30]  It has nothing to do with the presentation.  A good baker knows it has a lot to do with the presentation.  I love these cookies.  Your mom is the baking champion.  She's got the main belt, but I'm sorry, Matt's mom is the fucking cookie making champion.  You're very good.  I understand that what...  Jimmy, are you in agreement?  100%.  You don't remember Sam...  You've eaten four cookies in three minutes.  And you don't remember Sam's cookies.  Sam's mom's cookies.  We don't remember what they were...  Realize the way you're eating is utter shit.  And that's all it is.  It's delicious shit. 
[03:35:00]  It looks like a down center cookie.  It does.  I don't like cookies.  Thank you, Matt.  Look, he won't even try the cookies.  Next time you fucking walk behind me, I swear to God, I'm just going to headbutt you.  Okay.  Why do that when you got...  You know.  Well.  You should.  That's the easy thing.  I wish you would.  I just said, you know.  His neediness is keeping you late here.  I know, right?  No, it's not.  It's his caring and his mother's hard work is keeping us here.  His mom didn't work hard.  First day back and we're here at 1020.  What's wrong with us?  You're making a major disturbance on my time. 
[03:35:30]  Eric.  Yeah.  Do you like that we're pointing out how needy Matt is?  No, because you're catering to what he wants.  Really?  Get a good one.  Would you have one of the cookies?  No.  Oh, that much.  You must really need chocolate.  He's sitting on the floor all day.  I'm not touching them.  And they were made on Saturday morning.  Saturday night.  They were made on Saturday night.  They were.  Saturday night.  S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y.  That was a good song, actually. 
[03:36:00]  That wasn't.  Big and some cookies.  Roland, you eat the cookies?  Cookies on Saturday night.  Roland won't eat the cookies.  Nobody trusts Matt.  Why would anybody eat things?  He's not trustworthy.  No, I disagree.  I disagree.  When you go to church and they go buy my cookies.  Who's ripping a church?  Church.  What's a church?  What is church?  I don't know what church is.  Wow.  You either buy chicken or praise Jesus.  It's those places.  Church.  Church.  Church.  He said church.  He said church.  I know.  If you go to church.  What is that?  I've never been to church. 
[03:36:30]  I'm a child of the Lord.  I'd never heard it said that way.  Church.  Oh, Roland.  Can you have that?  Can we hear that?  You're like, just go back a little bit.  Hang on.  Go and see me to church.  It was like whistle, sound, sound, whistle, church, whistle, sound, sound, whistle.  Nobody knows what you're saying, Roland.  Whistle, sound, sound, whistle.  Yeah.  Sis, with, be, I, sir, v, sir, church.  Church.  Church.  Church.  Just comes over.  You can't do the word.  What happens to the words in your mouth?  It's like they fucking fight to get out first. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah.  There's no orderly progression of words.  My turn.  Excuse me, pardon me.  Excuse me, pardon me.  My turn.  My turn.  Church go to cookies.  Let my turn.  Excuse me, pardon me.  Bakery.  You got it, D-Rock?  Yeah, I got it.  Hit it.  He's not trustworthy.  No, I disagree.  He's like the church.  He's like the church.  He's like the church.  Nobody knows what you're mean.  A church.  Obviously, you can't give yourself a pizza party today for that one, Roland.  I'd love pizza.  No pizza party.  He can't give himself one, though.  I got you autographs, so I can. 
[03:37:30]  That is true.  Oh, shit.  And he got Dr. J in.  And then tomorrow we have another one.  Oh, dude.  No game.  I know.  It's in my Xbox.  Oh, shit.  You get the case.  Roland could be the biggest asshole ever.  My brother, if he's listening, I got a Dr. J autograph for his son.  Yeah.  And it's the new NBA 2K12 game for Xbox.  And I'm figuring, all right, it's cool to have the autograph, but it could be cool to 
[03:38:00]  have the game as well.  I open it up.  There's no game inside.  Roland's playing it.  Tell him, I forgot it is.  Tell him, it's a fun game.  What the fuck?  I can't give him an empty case with a Dr. J autograph?  Or you could, let's say, you could rent it from the GameStop.  Let's have a sound of shit.  Give him a shush.  Shit, that's funny.  It's like, it must be shush.  That's funny, man.  You know, Paul's here, too.  He's probably, not that Paul.  He's probably very jealous that Matt is stealing his way to steal airtime. 
[03:38:30]  Why?  What happened?  Well, because Paul started doing it as a desperate attention cry, and then Matt realized  that it was working, so Matt said, oh, I'll cash in on the desperate cry for attention  that Paul started doing, and now you're naming Matt's mom cookie champion.  She should be.  Well, she's got the title right now, Sam.  And what about Paul's mom?  Paul's mom is in a rough spot right now.  Definitely.  She doesn't have any belts.  Your mom's got the overall belt, and Matt's mom's got the cookie-making belt.  That key lime pie is one of the better treats we had, though, in all honesty. 
[03:39:00]  I fucking loved it.  Yeah, I love heartburn, too.  Honestly, I love it.  Rowan just said, I love heartburn, too.  I didn't hear what that was.  Shush.  Shush.  Yeah, see, shush.  Shush.  Do we have that fucking, that noise, whatever that was, that's supposed to be where?  Shush.  Shush.  But it was, what's leading up to it was just like a jumble of nothing.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm trying to do shush.  I'm trying to do shush.  Who hears that and goes yes?  It's like his teeth fell out in the middle of trying to say church. 
[03:39:30]  He's not trustworthy.  No, I disagree.  He's like the church.  Church.  He's like the church.  Church.  That didn't even resemble church.  That was amazing.  Blue Meanie listens to the show, huh?  Blue Meanie is a big fan.  What's up, Blue?  Really?  Yeah.  Hey, Blue Meanie, that's a horrible Titan Tron entrance video.  No, you always think Brian Knobs is the Blue Meanie.  They're two different guys.  Brian Knobs was a nasty boy. 
[03:40:00]  A little bit.  Not really.  I mean, you're the only person that's ever confused the two.  Brian Knobs has nothing blue on him.  I don't care.  It's just still real to me.  I thought it was Blue Meanie without the blue stuff on.  Through my tears.  Blue Meanie still has the blue stuff.  Through your tears.  Wow, Vince fucking went on with the show.  God damn.  That's fucking...  That takes balls.  Through your tears.  Through your tears.  I mean, at one point they had to bring the body out as what?  Wrestlers are going backstage?  Yeah, they had to cart it down the aisle. 
[03:40:30]  They should have used it as a prop.  You think so?  Yeah, yeah.  Like some kind of coffin match at the end?  Yes.  Something like that.  When he rolls out of it.  Oh my God, King.  Oh my God.  What a slobber knocker.  At that point, why not, though?  Well, I mean, that'd just be disrespecting the body.  But who cares?  Your body's gone.  Well, I think that the other wrestlers would not like the fact that one of their comrades  was dead and their body being used to survive.  Oh, well.  Maybe The Undertaker would be done.  I don't know.  Was The Undertaker part of that show? 
[03:41:00]  Yeah.  Oh, God.  They could have done a whole thing.  Oh, God.  Yeah, that might have been a little odd, having The Undertaker come out.  That was probably uncomfortable.  But he still came out, didn't he?  If I remember right.  Oh, God.  I mean, there was a long time when we called him the dead man.  And, yeah.  Yeah.  A little too real.  Well, you know, this show has to go on.  People pay their money.  And, you know, what happens? 
[03:41:30]  Should we go home now?  Yes.  On this note.  I mean, you have this idiot in here with his dumb cookies.  You did a great job, Matt.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Mark the time.  We get to go home early tomorrow, Sam.  Don't fuck us on our time.  Well, you don't get rollover.  Don't fuck us on.  We get rollover.  Rollover minutes.  You don't generally get rollover.  We don't count our fucking days off around here.  We get rollovers.  By the way, can I tease something for tomorrow?  Ooh.  Yeah.  Perhaps a little preview of a couple of songs off the upcoming SFP record. 
[03:42:00]  Oh.  Wow.  What's SFP again?  It's the fucking puppies.  I've heard some of these songs.  I've been in the process, the writing process.  Yeah.  They're not even, they're badass.  It's like.  Yeah, badass.  Let me just put it this way.  There'll be a parental advisory label on this CD.  Are we going to produce this?  Or is it going to be sitting in a hot tub like a dummy?  Like a dummy.  Does it compete with Julia?  It's better.  It's real heavy stuff. 
[03:42:30]  Oh.  It's got messages.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Chip gets political sometimes.  Oh, oh, okay.  You feel like Bono.  No, but he's more like an anarchist.  You know what I mean?  Like, he's like a punk rocker.  And he does his own guitar, like, with his mouth just to hear the demo.  Oh, cool.  It's good.  Can't wait to hear it.  Oh, my God.  Are you backing better than ever?  What?  I got a bellyache.  Bellyache on that cookie.  All right.  Wouldn't it be funny if we all shit in the elevator and blood just started? 
[03:43:00]  By the way, I tweeted last night one of the funniest lines anyone, it was Otto, when  George said, I'll fuck you in the ass until there's blood in your shoes.  And I tweeted that I could not stop laughing.  That's really getting fucked in the ass.  But what a beautiful, graphic, genius line that is.  I laughed for a half hour ago.  That is great.  So, Otto, hats off.  What are walnuts in this chocolate chip cookie?  That's stupid.  What a fucking asshole.  I'm allergic to nuts.  Peanut butter in a chocolate chip cookie.  There's nuts. 
[03:43:30]  Look.  Don't be clever.  Just fucking make a cookie, for fuck's sake.  Yeah, exactly.  Why don't you just make a cookie with chocolate chips in it?  Yeah, thank you.  That's what people knock out chips.  Look how needy that cookie is.  It's a piece of shit.  Look how needy it is.  How can you guys knock these delicious fucking cookies?  I love it, but I got to point out how needy the cookie is.  They're all going to get thrown out.  Nobody's going to eat them.  There's so much shit, like, shoved into it.  Exactly.  You don't have one.  They're good.  Oh, you don't like chocolate.  They're good.  Well, if you don't like walnuts, you like the chocolate chips.  If you don't like that, you like the peanut butter.  That's right.  Why don't you just have some confidence in what you make? 
[03:44:00]  One thing.  I'm tempted to take these home.  If I wasn't such a piggy boy piggy already, I would take these home.  But you probably have something to celebrate.  It's true.  You do treat yourself.  Oh, no.  I just did.  Treat yourself.  You did again.  You did good with the Dr. J interview.  Maybe I should treat yourself.  You got the signed basketball.  That's where the treat.  That is my treat.  No, but you getting it.  You getting it.  That deserves a treat.  You should celebrate that fact.  I just treated myself to four cookies.  I have a tummy ache from eating four cookies. 
[03:44:30]  It's probably going to get worse.  Everybody's got tummy aches from these shit cookies.  Shit cookies.  It's garbage.  I love a good homemade cookie, man.  Yeah, but this is not a good homemade cookie.  Dude, those are giant, thick fucking cookies.  Gives you belly aches.  I've never...  I was at my mom's house eating homemade cookie dough, and I didn't get a belly ache.  Look at you.  Delicious.  She just leaves him in the freezer, because in case Sam comes over...  She just leaves him in her pussy.  Pussy in her mouth.  That's disgusting.  Holy shit. 
[03:45:00]  I didn't mean it.  I didn't mean it.  It doesn't even make any sense.  I'm sorry.  I'd love to keep co-courting with your people, but I'm out of here.  I'm sorry I said that.  I'm leaving.  It should be.  I didn't mean it.  I'm sorry I said that.  It was just off the cuff.  You already said it.  Oh, don't worry about it.  It's out there.  I should have said asshole.  The game won't appear if you keep on opening.  Dude.  Fuck.  I hope he's upset about the game.  It's a game without a game inside, Anthony.  It's a last minute, though.  Yeah, you gotta take a...  What? 
[03:45:30]  Later, man.  It's a last minute.  See you, Jim.  It's a Jim that time.  Good first show back, guys.  I'm excited for what the week has in store for all of us.  Four more great shows.  I can feel it.  Goodbye, Sam.  See you later, Jim.  Opie.  What's this?  Let's see what he's doing here.  What's this idiot doing back in here?  Matt, the intern. 
[03:46:00]  Don't take him.  That was just for the air.  Oh, wow.  They are good, though.  They were really good, but that was just for the air.  I don't want to bring any home.  You're still on the air.  Yeah.  Ouch.  And he's actually walking out.  All right.  Well, I mean, I feel like they did a good show today.  I hope everybody out there enjoyed it.  We still have After Opie and Anthony Live coming up, so a whole bunch more fun is in store.  The show's still on.  It's still the Opie and Anthony show.  You guys can't come in here yet.  You understand. 
[03:46:30]  Sam, all I know is I saw...  Shut up!  I've been ending the show!  I saw you staring at those cookies.  Shut up!  Iraq, control your intern.  What's he talking?  Just shut up.  I'm not going to.  You will.  Get...  Just go.  I know you will.  I'm not going to try any of your bullshit.  Shut the...  You can't resist.  There's nothing irresistible about these cookies.  I just threw one on the floor.  You see what I did there, Eric?  Throw it in the glass.  I just threw the...  See this?  You know what?  It just hit it like a brick. 
[03:47:00]  It didn't even break.  You think my mom would be happy?  These are the shittiest cookies ever.  Stay tuned.  After Opie and Anthony Live is coming up next.  My high school on Wikipedia, Jim Norton.  Jim Norton is number one.  Is the number one name out of my high school.  Yes.  And that's a tremendously...  Who is that, by the way?  Exactly.  It's me.  Who's that?  Who's Jim Norton?  He's 100%.  That's exactly what his reaction should have been.  Who?  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Sirius XM. </pre>
