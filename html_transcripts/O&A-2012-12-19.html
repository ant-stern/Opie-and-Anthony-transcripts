<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a heated discussion about the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting and the media's coverage of it. Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton heavily criticized CNN, Dr. Phil, and Piers Morgan for their perceived sensationalism and focus on the shooter rather than the victims.  They engaged in a Twitter feud with Piers Morgan and debated gun control, violent video games, and the influence of 24-hour news cycles.  The conversation included a caller, a retired police officer, suggesting a federal death penalty for mass shooters, and explored ideas like armed guards in schools and a national mental health database for gun purchasers.  They also briefly touched on unrelated news items, including Lindsay Lohan and Michael Douglas' son.  The segment concluded with comments on Kate Upton.  The entire discussion was highly informal and laced with profanity and sexually explicit comments.

The show then transitioned to a discussion about gun control, prompted by a hypothetical active shooter scenario in a restaurant. This segued into a humorous segment about a listener's severe femur injury and a host's boating mishap near the Statue of Liberty, involving a mistaken mooring buoy for a submarine.  A significant portion of this segment featured the playing and discussion of the bizarre song "The Shepherd of Leaves," alongside a brief mention of "The Christmas Skater" by Ronan Fez.  A phone interview with Larry Pratt of Gun Owners of America was played, where he debated Piers Morgan on CNN about gun control and the Sandy Hook shooting.  The hosts commented on the interview, with differing opinions on Pratt's arguments and Morgan's interviewing style.  The segment concluded with further discussion of gun control, the Second Amendment, and the hosts' pudding and snack preferences.  David Tell and Judd Apatow were announced as upcoming guests.

The next segment continued the gun control debate, this time with in-studio guest David Tell. They discussed civilian gun ownership as a deterrent to government overreach,  with increasingly violent hypothetical scenarios.  Larry Pratt's evasive response to Piers Morgan was replayed. The conversation veered into the use of comfort dogs in Newtown and the media's intrusion on the grieving process.  This segment also included caller commentary, a discussion about an upcoming Judd Apatow interview, and a detailed discussion of Tell's upcoming comedy gigs.  A segment was also dedicated to the passing of Gus, one half of a long-term gay couple known to the show. A video of a golden eagle dropping a child was shown.  The segment concluded with more discussion about the Judd Apatow interview and his upcoming movie, "This is 40".

The Judd Apatow interview focused on the media's coverage of tragedies, comparing the intense focus on events like Columbine and 9/11 to lesser-publicized ones.  Apatow discussed his personal approach to news consumption and criticized Dr. Phil's interviewing techniques.  They discussed societal issues of violence and the reasons certain tragedies resonate more deeply with the public. A significant part involved discussion of Apatow's new movie, including its R-rating, sex scenes, Viagra use, and his family's involvement.  He also discussed his experiences working on "The Larry Sanders Show," mentioning guests like Bob Goldthwait, Adam Sandler, and Steven Wright. The conversation covered television comedy, the influence of special interest groups on media, internet accessibility of explicit content, and Apatow's children's exposure to various media. The segment concluded with listener calls to Jim Norton's advice show, featuring calls about marital sex, infidelity, family issues, addiction (oxycodone), unrequited love, online prostitution, high-dosage Viagra, and strained friendships. Callers often used offensive language.  The show ended with Jim Norton's sign-off, following numerous listener calls and an email exchange with a Steven Singer jewelry promoter.

[00:00:00]  Oh 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So, flatulent.  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know it started. 
[00:04:00]  Like rotten eggs and sewage.  Oh, wow.  Thank you.  I can't believe that I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  This is not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  All in a day.  Every day, that's what I say.  Are you guys having a good time or what?  Yeah!  Yeah!  Rules are destroyed.  And convention burns the ground. 
[00:04:30]  Would you like to make some fucking second?  With Opie, the destroyer.  I would eat Betty White's ass.  She's 90, right?  That doesn't smell too bad.  Anthony, the rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fair you wanted.  Fire these people up my ass all the time trying to get me to hell.  Fuck you!  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender.  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off.  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in, dicks. 
[00:05:00]  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah!  Good morning, everybody.  It's Wednesday, huh?  Yeah!  December 19th.  I'm back!  Two days before the end of the world.  I wonder if he can call in. 
[00:06:00]  Piers?  Yeah.  He can call the show anytime he wants.  He's been on the show.  So, it's funny.  Like, people are picking up on the fact, lately anyway, every afternoon it's Jim Norton and Opie starting their Twitter wars.  I wait until the night time.  Yeah, you're on a different time schedule.  But right around 2, 3 o'clock, me and Jimmy start revving it up.  He's still hitting the Westboro Baptist Church.  Yeah.  And I just had a simple question to Piers Morgan. 
[00:06:30]  And, fuck, he engaged me.  But he couldn't answer the question.  Because I'm so sick of, well, we're sick of a lot of things, and we're going to get into all of it.  But, you know, they're starting to focus on that violent video game shit again.  Yeah, yeah.  But they won't focus on themselves.  Right.  Because it's pretty much in the same category.  If you think violent video games could affect someone and make them, you know, shoot up a school, well, then wouldn't that be said about your 24-hour news cycle?  They never fucking acknowledged that at all. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, I just wrote it to Piers.  And then he engaged me in calling us flaming hypocrites.  So, I guess we're all gay and all that.  Nice.  And he's like, you know, you guys aren't touching on, you know, the school shooting?  And I said, we absolutely are, but in a way more honest way than CNN has.  We're not standing there with a camera trying to get angles inside the school, and nobody takes us seriously.  Right.  And a lot of our coverage is focusing on how the media is covering this tragedy. 
[00:07:30]  So, he could call in, but he's not going to, because he can't answer that question for whatever reason.  The media is the focus of the outrage for several, and they deserve to be.  A lot of people are focusing on the media, man.  And there's an article that came out in Denver, I believe.  Hopefully, we have that in front of us.  The locals want them to go home.  Yes.  Go home.  Oh, yeah, I did see that.  Yeah, yeah.  Go home.  It's obvious.  And we all went after Dr. Phil yesterday, too, because... 
[00:08:00]  Oh, yeah.  He's just a fucking pig with a mustache.  Yeah.  I mean, here, it's as simple as this.  You're Dr. Phil, right?  Oh, no.  I don't want to be Dr. Phil.  Good point.  You want to go up there and help the people?  Fine.  Go up there without the fucking cameras.  As soon as you turn on the cameras, you're exploiting it for your own benefit.  Absolutely.  And you know what?  That's fine.  I'm here to say that's fine.  But don't be dishonest about it.  Don't fucking say you're going up there to help.  Right. 
[00:08:30]  You're not...  As soon as you turn those cameras on, you're...  All right.  Maybe you're helping still a little bit, but you're also focusing on how this is good for  you.  We've been in the business for a while.  You know the cold, calculated meeting that went behind Dr. Phil going up there?  Like all the production people and everything, and sales, and all the people got together  and said, how could we get up there and make this work?  How could we get Dr. Phil up there?  And nothing.  It wasn't, let's help. 
[00:09:00]  It was all that logistics that goes along with sending a show somewhere.  Don't give me the help bullshit.  It's P.T. Barnum shit.  Right.  And we all love P.T. Barnum shit.  But as a society, we've decided that's kind of primitive and barbaric.  So what we've done is we package it better to make it look like we're helping.  Yeah.  We still have P.T. Barnum shit, but they just package it nice.  It's like, oh, Hoarders is P.T. Barnum shit. 
[00:09:30]  Intervention is P.T. Barnum shit.  Little People, Big World, not on TV anymore.  That's P.T. Barnum sideshow shit.  All the TLC shows where the lady has giant legs.  We all saw that one.  Fucking monster.  Remember her with her heavy legs?  That's P.T. Barnum stuff.  Fucking tumor face guy.  Tumor face tree guy.  Tree face guy.  Tree face man.  That's all sideshow, but it's just package.  So we feel better about ourselves that we're not just pointing and going, holy shit, look 
[00:10:00]  at that.  Yeah.  I wouldn't be as hard on Dr. Phil if he had flown people out to L.A. or whatever, but  the fact that he's going there, he wants to say, I'm here, I'm in the middle, he really  is such a disgusting guy as far as I'm concerned.  He is just, and Dr. Oz too.  These guys are fucking disgusting.  Dr. Oz.  No, I'll tell you, Dr. Phil was taking a fucking savaging on Twitter yesterday.  Yeah.  And believe me, he's not, he's used to getting criticized, but he is not used to the savaging 
[00:10:30]  that a lot of people gave him.  It wasn't just us, it was a lot of people.  He's beloved.  Oh, boy, did he get a fucking beating.  Good.  What I did, because Twitter is really strange, like, if you don't follow both people, you  can't see the exchange, I guess.  Nine.  So I put the whole exchange I had with Piers Morgan on my Facebook page, OP Radio Fans,  if you want to check it out for yourself.  But basically, I just wrote, I've been writing all these guys. 
[00:11:00]  I go, hey, Piers, stop being so ignorant.  I'd blame 24-hour news cycles before violent video games for the increase in school shootings.  He writes, and I bet you radio guys have barely mentioned it, right?  Don't be such flaming hypocrites.  Wow.  And that got me going.  I go, hey, Piers, I mean idiot.  I'll guarantee we've taken a way more honest approach than stupid CNN, including not focusing  on the shooter.  We haven't even mentioned the shooter's name once, and we barely focus on him.  And then I write, Piers, how badly does CNN want to put Chuck E. Cheese in Google Maps 
[00:11:30]  to find more surviving six-year-olds to interview?  Not helping.  And then I wrote, you don't think CNN using the graphics small coffins is not sensationalizing  the tragedy?  At least I could sleep at night, you phony.  Because we know who we are in the end.  I mean, when they started, you know, the graphic yesterday was small coffins.  I don't know if anyone else was watching CNN.  Oh, they love the tiny, they love saying tiny coffins.  Tiny coffins.  Yeah, they said that on one of the papers today.  I saw small that they were using over and over again. 
[00:12:00]  And then finally he wrote back.  He goes, you lead the way then.  Don't mention another word about it.  Then you won't be such shameless hypocrites.  But no one's saying don't talk about it.  It's the way they cover it.  Exactly.  Thank you.  So then I write, you didn't answer my question because he's trying to, you know, do that  old deflect shit.  Does the media influence others to shoot up a school?  You're not dumb, but you are dishonest.  And I don't even know the answer to that.  But I'm just saying, if you're going to throw violent video games into the discussion, 
[00:12:30]  that certainly should be discussed as well.  Yeah.  24 hours, I said it later on in the night, that's not part of this exchange.  I know more about this shooter.  And people are like, well, just turn it off.  I can't really turn it off because it's kind of part of what we do as well.  So we kind of want to be in the know.  But I said on Twitter last night, I know more about this kid than Mick Jagger.  People are like, oh, that's ridiculous.  No, it's not.  I really do know more about this kid than Mick Jagger.  And I'm kind of a Stones fan.  I know nothing about Mick Jagger's mother, what his home life is like.  I know about this kid. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  I have no idea.  You know, oh, and then Piers.  Jesus, it's it's not.  Oh, oh, oh, he writes.  I'm sorry.  I like you guys, but please stop being so ridiculous.  You've covered this story and debated it.  I've heard you and I hate that shit.  So I just write Jesus.  It's not about liking us.  You're blowing off an important angle.  Does 24 hour news coverage influence future school shootings?  That's all I wanted an answer to.  That's it.  Uh, and then I finally wrote your silence to my question speaks volumes checkmate. 
[00:13:30]  And then I wrote OP radio one, Piers Morgan zero.  Good day, sir.  And then I had to go, by the way, soccer sucks because he tweets about soccer a lot.  Tweets about fucking soccer.  So then he has to write, it's not soccer.  It's football.  The real kind.  No helmets.  No pads.  Round ball.  Global audience.  And then I wrote, I'd rather watch Mark Sanchez throw four more interceptions than that dreck.  Just answer the question would be real journalism.  Uh, sorry.  There's a long one.  It's just about that's fine.  Uh, then, uh, Piers writes, uh, my answer is, so we finally answer what he thinks he's 
[00:14:00]  answered my question with this and this drove me nuts, but I knew I was, I had to be done  with this.  He writes, my answer is this.  I think CNN's coverage has been utterly outstanding.  Oh, reporting the news with empathy, compassion, and dignity.  That doesn't answer my question.  You see, none of the, he can't admit it because it's, he's there.  Right.  Yeah.  I wrote good for you guys, but that wasn't my question.  I know that, you know, I go, I know that, you know, that you can't honestly answer the 
[00:14:30]  question face.  And so let me ask you, so he thinks dignity, even though it wasn't a CNN reporter that asked  that question of the little girl, um, like were your classmates, what kind of trying to  get the little girl to cry.  So you think that's dignity to show that little six year old.  It's, it's, they're, they're delusional.  And the problem with violent video, we talk about violent video games all the time.  That's in the mix of discussion.  People know, I think it contributes on a small level.  It's certainly not the only factor, but it may be one of five parts. 
[00:15:00]  I don't think it's completely innocent either.  Yeah.  You're never going to have a perfect record.  So, you know, you got it.  You got a delusional kid.  He might be on some meds, a lonely guy.  He's on violent video games.  Sure.  I think, sure.  That's a possibility that something's going to snap, but it's, it's tough to ignore all the  people that do play violent video games and nothing will ever happen.  And like I said, I'm going to say it again.  And in a lot of cases, I bet you it actually helps them get some aggression out.  Well, we want to take a look at a tennis ball and decide he's supposed to kill people. 
[00:15:30]  So whether it's video games or anything else, you're talking about an unstable fucking crazy  person.  And yeah, if that's the case, then maybe violent video games will, you know, react poorly with  them.  But it's not the millions of people are playing.  But I think if you know, you could go out like, like these school shooters and you see  how they're going to cover it.  I think that's something to at least discuss.  I think it's just as viable to discuss that as it is video games and gun control and everything. 
[00:16:00]  And the problem is violent video games are talked about.  No, the media never does the story.  What have we contributed?  They never do that story.  Yeah.  They simply, maybe once in a while, MSNBC will attack Fox or Fox will attack CNN.  But as a whole, they never get together and say, what are we contributing by showing?  Look at this, the post that had the kid's face again on the front page.  Front page.  We, we've, we've been doing radio a really long time.  We were lucky enough to be on the front page, uh, once. 
[00:16:30]  And you know what?  That, that was kind of cool.  Not gonna lie to you.  And it was for something horrific.  You know, a lot of people say what we did at St. Patrick's Cathedral was horrific.  It got us on the front page.  And as much as we were going through some shit when that all went down, it was fucking  cool to be on the front page of the paper.  I'm telling you, I could sit here live.  It was like, wow, look, it was for a bad reason.  Then I would have liked it because we won some kind of like, you know, fucking radio award  or something, something a little more classy or whatever.  But no, in the end, we were on the front page for something kind of horrific. 
[00:17:00]  But I went home that day going, holy fuck.  We made the front page of the paper.  How cool is this?  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  And it definitely does something, I think.  I think it definitely has an impact on people that are unstable and say, well, I could, I  could go out in a blaze of glory and I'll get all kinds of press and I'll be that famous  person and remembered forever like I always wanted to be.  That's definitely something that should be looked into. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  And, you know, I am happy because I do see a change over the last year or two.  They are, they do focus a lot more on the victims.  There was a time they never did.  They're like, oh, you know, 20 people were killed today or whatever.  And you never knew their names, their faces.  You would see their faces in the paper on all, you know, one page with their names and  their ages.  And that was it.  Then they would just move on.  But they're at least, you know, there's, there has been a pushback.  And I think it is the public have been pressuring these, you know, these, these news, 
[00:18:00]  these news media outlets.  So I think they are feeling the pressure a little bit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But they can't wait to get right back to the profile of, you know, the shooter.  Oh, they love digging in and getting all the info they can.  What do you got?  I'm just, I'm actually Twittering right to Rupert Murdoch.  I'm not even, I'm being respectful to him because I actually like Murdoch, but I just,  I'm sorry.  Stand of doom.  They're showing this kid every day in the post and it's like, you know what you're doing.  Right.  Like that's what bugs, like we know we do dirty jokes and we're perverts and we're pigs. 
[00:18:30]  They know they're contributing and they don't care.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the den of doom, uh, and I were talking before the show, it's just where he played  his violent video games.  You don't play violent video games with fucking, uh, you know, the windows open and the sun  coming in.  You want to darken the room and, and set up a nice, uh, nice gaming site for yourself.  What the fuck is a den of doom?  You know where I played my video games when I was a kid?  Oh, in my basement.  Yeah.  Just like him.  Right.  That's where you play your fucking games. 
[00:19:00]  You don't want fucking windows and the sun coming in when you're trying to immerse yourself  into whatever game you're into.  No, plus your parents don't want you to play it in the living room all day.  Right.  That's why they set things up for the kids in the basement.  Yeah.  They say, take it to your room or take it to the basement.  Sure.  So I had a den of doom.  You had a den of doom.  Take it to the mad cave.  Take it to daddy's mad cave.  Yeah.  The mad cave.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fuck.  So, yeah. 
[00:19:30]  I don't know.  A lot of people going out buying fucking guns, that's for sure.  A lot of guns being sold.  Well, we kind of knew that would happen.  A lot of guns.  Guns.  I think people are kind of thinking this assault weapons ban is going to go through.  I think it is, too.  I think it'll absolutely go through.  So everybody's buying up as many as they can, because most of the time these things pass,  and when they passed last time, they don't take away the ones that are out there.  They just stop selling any new ones. 
[00:20:00]  Right.  So people are stocking up.  Yeah.  So they'll buy as many assault rifles as possible until the ban goes into effect, which, you know,  it's not official, but it absolutely looks like it's happening.  Yeah, yeah.  You know.  This is a...  I don't know.  I don't know if that helps things.  I'm not going to sit here and say it does.  It'll put a lot of people at ease, I'm sure.  Until the next one.  They'll have some kind of false security, I guess.  The country just needs something right now.  It's like we don't know who to be angry at because the guy's dead.  Right.  So right now, I mean, this happens every shooting. 
[00:20:30]  Can we at least, like, find the father and slap him around a little bit?  Just a little bit.  For his bad cum?  Someone said...  Am I the only one that would feel maybe a little better if they just slapped him around just a little bit?  Someone said he doesn't have that fucking nasty ex-wife anymore or the burdensome son.  Yeah, no kidding.  So he's fucking...  He made out...  Jesus.  Look, there's something we have brought up over the years about tragedies.  Not everyone is completely bummed out, and I've got to be careful how I say that. 
[00:21:00]  But there are people that go, holy fuck, I was in a bad fucking situation.  And I'm not talking about the fucking kids at all.  I'm talking about maybe this guy if he was in a horrific situation.  Yeah.  Jesus.  I don't know.  The NRA released a statement yesterday, which I don't know what they're actually going to do.  I guess they have to, but I was impressed with the statement.  Do you think they should have released that sooner than they did?  Actually, it's pretty soon, though.  Kind of hard for them to do anything.  These days go by very slowly. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, kind of hard for them.  It's only been five days.  Right.  To do anything in situations like this.  You know, they're going to be looked at like, ah, you're fucking, ah, the monsters, ah.  So, yeah, they waited.  I think their statement is, you know, it's...  I'm not a fan of the statements.  We've seen those over the years, too.  They're pretty much, of course they're going to say that.  You know what I mean?  And that works on both sides.  But they said, you know, they're going to do something, I guess, be involved in some way.  All right.  They're doing a press conference Friday. 
[00:22:00]  That's promising.  They're having a press conference Friday where they're going to pretty much spell out, I guess, what they want to do.  But I think it's going to be...  What's the statement?  What's the...  Yeah, it's got it.  The actual statement.  Yes, the National Rifle Association broke its silence on the shooting, denouncing the horrific and senseless murders and vowing to, quote, help make sure this never happens again.  Facing fierce push of new restrictions on gun ownership and the tragedy's aftermath, the group said that it would hold a major news conference in Washington on Friday. 
[00:22:30]  Did you read what they actually said?  Yeah.  Okay.  The National Rifle Association of America is made up of four million moms, dads, sons, and daughters.  And we were shocked, saddened, and heartbroken by the news of the horrific and senseless murders in Newtown.  The organization said in a statement emailed to reporters, the NRA is prepared to offer meaningful contributions to help make sure this never happens again.  But what that means...  Do they usually say stuff like that?  No.  They don't.  Never.  That's the first, right?  That's the first they've ever gone. 
[00:23:00]  Never.  In my memory.  They've never gone that far.  So this is a doozy, man.  A fucking doozy.  Westboro is protesting, of course, but they're doing the principal's funeral.  Why?  Why don't they do them all?  Oh, boy.  I'm imagining the police told them we won't be able to protect you.  I'm imagining the police told them, if you do that, we will not protect you.  They're going to actually be outside with their signs?  Oh, yeah.  They might have done it.  That's going to be a problem. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, did they do it already?  I don't know.  I think there might be a problem.  They're up there now.  Holy fuck, man.  That's the principal that ran out trying to do something and gets killed?  That's great.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what...  Whatever.  But the reason I'm raising is I'm wondering if...  I don't think they care, but the cops or somebody senses...  Like, this one, for some reason, feels a lot different than the other ones have.  And the president reacted differently than any president has, as far as, you know, being  emotional about it.  The NRA makes a statement like that. 
[00:24:00]  There's a really weird undercurrent of people are really fed up.  Everyone has kids or has, you know, knows kids that are, you know...  Right.  You know, your brother's kids, your sister's kids, whatever it would be.  Everyone has kids.  And that innocent thing is what's brutal.  And, you know, not to make light of it, but it's way worse than Columbine.  And we all know how bad Columbine was.  Because Columbine was terrible, but there was something different about a peer shooting  his peers, which is still terrible. 
[00:24:30]  Of course.  But it's more understandable than an adult killing kids.  Right.  Because you can't comprehend...  Because we can all understand being mad at our peers.  Right.  But you can't understand shooting kids.  Yeah, you know, yeah, I don't want that twisted.  Both horrible.  But when you have innocent kids, and we kind of know some of the details, and they never  had a chance, that hits home with pretty much everybody.  It's awful.  It's awful.  And people are just...  And I think this guy did us a favor by killing himself, because now the whole country is aggravated 
[00:25:00]  and disgusted and angry, and there's nowhere to focus it, because he's not there.  So let's pull the Aurora guy out of his fucking jail cell and slice his throat.  Yeah.  Let's take it out on him.  I would love one cop.  I'm going to say it every day.  We're not better than that.  Stop making believe we are.  One cop, that's all it would take to do that.  Or one guard.  Yeah.  Just two guards to say, look, we'll give up the...  Just to beat...  Of course, they won't, but how great would that be if they just beat him to death with  their billy glass?  Nice. 
[00:25:30]  He's well protected.  He's well protected.  Yeah.  You know who wasn't well protected in jail?  It's a story we haven't even touched on yet.  Michael Douglas' son is fucked up.  Yep.  Michael Douglas' son ended up getting into some deep trouble with drugs, and they got  him, and they sent him to jail.  What was his sentence?  Ten years.  He got ten years.  I don't even think the kid's 30.  Oh, wait, hold on.  Did he get ten years?  He got years for dealing, I think, meth, and he's a heroin addict, but then he got caught  getting stuff sent to him in jail, which extended his sentence, I think. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, so there was some payback.  Some payback in jail, because he's not protected like they're protecting this asshole in Aurora.  Would they fuck him up?  Yeah.  Fucked him up bad.  Like, he's in bad shape.  Jesus.  Really bad shape.  Broken femur.  Broken femur.  And I think a broken finger.  Apparently, there was some Italian group that got wind that he was, like, his psychiatrist  fucked up and accidentally said on the stand that he had agreed to testify.  Right.  Oh, boy.  It was a complete mistake, but his dumb shrink fucked him, and it became knowledge, and they 
[00:26:30]  put out a hundred dollar bounty on him getting him beat up.  Yeah.  We're, in some ways, we're pathetic as a nation, because you got this Aurora shooting,  shooter, whatever, and we protect him.  Look, you did the fucking thing.  Now you should be in prison like everyone else, and now take your fucking chances.  Sorry.  Why are we protecting him?  Yeah.  Because we're better than that?  I don't want to hear that anymore.  No, because lawyers will sue.  It's all about lawsuits.  It's all about if he's killed in state custody, that family sues the state and would win. 
[00:27:00]  That's all it's about.  Wow.  The quote is, Michael Douglas' son, he broke his femur, which is hard to snap.  Oh, a femur is your biggest bone there.  It's the Brian Regan bit that is really, really funny.  Search it out.  Or we could play it into Break Theory, Iraq.  That would be kind of good.  And he had to have a rod inserted.  Rod.  He told health services staff that he hurt them playing handball.  And then this guy writes, you don't break a femur playing handball. 
[00:27:30]  Handball.  How do you break a femur, you think?  Do they step, do they put it on something and jump on it?  Yeah, they must have stomped them.  Oh, my God.  Or do they hit it with a bat or a brick or something?  I'm only getting my info from Brian Regan, not Dr. Steve.  But supposedly that's pretty much the worst pain you could feel, is having your femur break.  Oh, that's a big bone.  It must have been stomping them, you know?  Just stomping them.  Would that break?  I guess it could break your femur if you're on his steps or something and it's up.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, wow.  Ow. 
[00:28:00]  So, bring it back to today.  You got the Aurora guy, well protected.  Yeah.  I don't think that's right.  No.  He's in prison.  You're fucking...  Because that's another thing, you know, potential shooters know.  Yeah, yeah.  They take me alive, I'll be protected.  Nothing horrific could actually happen to me.  Yeah.  At least you should fucking just throw them into general population.  Yeah.  But even though, I've lost faith in general population's ability to do the right... 
[00:28:30]  I don't think they give a fuck either.  Yeah.  Once in a while, you'll get a convict that has some kind of, you know, feelings towards  that.  But there's rapists in jail that are doing fine.  There's pedophiles in jail that they could get to and they don't.  Yeah, maybe we just don't know how the system works.  Yeah.  I guess you're right.  They're all a bunch of fucking lowlifes.  Yeah.  They just...  They don't want to go get more time and...  Yeah.  Kept breaking news.  Oh.  Lindsay Lohan?  Yes.  Reportedly clogged her toilet on Scary Movie 5 set. 
[00:29:00]  Do you know my dick jumped when I read that?  Clogged her toilet.  Clogged her toilet?  And that's news, by the way.  That's news today.  She took a big shit?  I guess.  I don't know.  She's denying it.  Oh, she's denying it?  Oh, just a big dump coming out of that ass.  I would imagine there...  She's got very dry duties.  Oh, man.  So that's a possibility.  Or maybe she had to use a lot of paper to wipe, because it looked like black tar heroin. 
[00:29:30]  Wow.  She was wiping her ass like a mudslide.  Was it that, or was it that her shower was off?  Was it really a toilet?  Did she take a big dump?  No.  I don't...  It's so great.  I don't think it was a big dump.  I hope so.  I like to think it is, but...  Oh, we all would.  Let's go to Rich.  Rich, what's up?  New York City, brother.  Retired cop.  God bless you.  What's up?  Hi, Rich.  What's up, man?  Hey, guys.  You know, the problem is, this Aurora thing, they won't even go to trial for another two  years, so it's going to give every defense lawyer...  It's almost like a law lesson how to defend against these pieces of shit.  If Obama really wanted to come up with some meaningful legislation, just like treason, 
[00:30:00]  like they killed that asshole in Oklahoma, make it a federal crime for any type of terrorist-type  shooting, automatic death penalty, takes it out of the hands of the state, and they  kill these fucks over the year.  They killed the fucking Oklahoma guy.  How fast?  After that bombing.  That Timothy McVeigh douchebag.  Rich, let me ask you, though.  Didn't Timothy McVeigh, once he was convicted, stop appealing?  Like, didn't he say, just go ahead and kill me?  Like, he'd still be a lot of you still appealing, wouldn't he?  Yeah, I bet. 
[00:30:30]  And I'm not sure.  Does Colorado have the death penalty?  And is this a death penalty case?  I would assume if you're shooting up a movie theater, it's a death penalty.  Premeditated?  Yeah, absolutely.  It's a death penalty case, but don't be surprised when they say it's not.  But you've got to make it federal, and you have to do something.  Taking guns away is not going to fucking stop, you know what?  Because this douchebag, instead of paying fucking $500 a buck, he'll pay fucking $2,000 for an AR and do the same thing.  And these douchebags are going to know that.  On the black market, right? 
[00:31:00]  That black market.  Especially if you know you're going to, like, take yourself out in the end.  Who gives a fuck?  You'll just empty your bank account.  You don't care how much it costs.  And let me be honest.  Anthony, you have guns.  If you buy an AR this week for $1,000, two years from now, it's worth $3,000.  A legit guy comes to you with a permit and wants to buy it for $3,000, you're going to sell it?  Well, I wouldn't.  Is it your fault?  No, I know you wouldn't, but I would.  But a lot of people will, yeah.  Yeah.  All right, fellas, punch it out.  Thanks, bud.  I didn't realize that's a good point, Rich, made about a federal crime and a state crime 
[00:31:30]  because it does take it out of the hands.  It almost takes the pressure off the states to have to go against their constituency.  It should be some type of a mass murder, what is classified as a mass murder.  Is there a way to make it a federal crime?  Oh, don't make a federal case out of it.  Oh, that's what I always say.  I leave the window open, you're cold, you make a federal case out of it.  What, are you going to give me the death penalty or something?  You're making a mountain out of a mole hill.  Yes.  I made a mountain out of a mole one time. 
[00:32:00]  There was a big hammer on it.  Are schools safer?  I don't know.  I know I dropped my kid off yesterday.  Is morally safer?  And there is nothing different.  Excuse me.  Yeah.  That was brilliant and the worst thing I've ever heard all at once.  Of course it is.  Terrible.  There's nothing different at my kid's school yesterday.  Nothing.  No?  But I am hearing that some Marines, or at least one, took it upon himself, said, fuck that. 
[00:32:30]  I'll patrol my local school.  A Marine!  Yeah.  A guy back from Iraq.  He's looking for some shit to do.  And he just took it upon himself, said, I'm here.  Just want to let you know I'm here.  I don't know how they felt about it, but he was trying.  And any shooter would know not to go to that school.  So, it's just...  Who knows?  I don't...  You know...  It's really just...  We've said it for the last few days.  I don't know what the answer is.  No.  I don't either.  No one does.  I really think it's very complicated. 
[00:33:00]  I really do.  Yeah.  Even though the Daily News is covering this a lot more...  A lot...  I have to say, unless I've missed something in the last few days, they're handling it in  a way that doesn't disgust me.  Not like the Post, yeah.  Like the Post is being tabloid, showing the kids picture.  Your den of doom.  And what they're focusing on is the funerals and the victims.  Like the Daily News, I mean.  It's focusing on the funerals and the victims.  And I don't mind that as much.  I think both papers suck, but the Post is way worse.  Yeah, they're doing a terrible job with these.  They're completely despicable. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  So...  Could you turn that page for a minute?  Sure.  What happened?  Let me see.  It took me five minutes to buy this rifle the morning after massacre.  It says that in five minutes is in red, and there's an arrow pointing to the rifle.  But there's no other rifle on the page.  It doesn't have to say the arrow.  We know which rifle you mean.  Yeah, we can figure it out.  Yeah.  Well, you still ought to go through your fucking check.  The background check.  The criminal check. 
[00:34:00]  Do you think the NRA is going to be for some kind of a national database of...  Is there a national database of mental health information that all gun people can get to  immediately?  No.  I'll bet you they're going to back something like that.  There's not even a fucking...  I don't have knowledge on this, but I would bet you...  No.  The thing is, it's...  That's kind of secret information.  You have a...  As far as your medical records go and your mental health records, a lot of times that's  fucking classified. 
[00:34:30]  You're right.  But I do think that it's a give and a take.  And if in this society we're going to allow you to have guns or allow each other to have  guns, in this day and age, in the wake of this shit, then I think that you have to say  my mental health is absolutely has to be up for grabs.  Like, meaning you have to be able to verify...  Uh-huh.  Well, when you want to become a cop, they give you a mental health test.  Oh, yeah.  Because they're going to give you a gun.  So when we allow certain things in society, there's a give back.  You have to prove that you can handle... 
[00:35:00]  You know what I'm saying?  Like, if you're a felon, you can't own a gun.  Yeah.  So why not if you're crazy?  I agree with you.  A national database of fucking nuts.  They've done enough to damage us.  I don't care if the world knows my mom's nuts.  Dude, absolutely.  I don't care.  There's going to be all kinds of talk, though, as far as will that then be used for other  things?  Will this database of your mental health be used for jobs or for the ability to adopt  children?  Like, where else does it come into play? 
[00:35:30]  And is that then going to restrict people from getting things based on their mental health?  Is that the old slippery slope?  It's...  Everything's a slippery slope.  It's amazing.  But when you really think about how things do happen in our country, people do just continue  to keep the ball rolling.  You know what I mean?  I mean, they don't just stop at one thing.  We were saying before the show, you know, the problem is that they're talking on the 
[00:36:00]  news already about we got to find a middle ground.  Yeah.  That's America's problem right there.  Ain't no...  We never find middle ground.  Maybe not never.  But in most cases, we never find middle ground.  It's either my way or it's their way.  My way on a highway.  Anyway, has it always been that way?  Seems like it's worse.  No.  I think there was some form of compromise years ago.  So what changed?  But now, I don't know.  What changed with that shit?  We're a very divided nation. 
[00:36:30]  We like divvying ourselves up.  And by the way, Anthony, the national database thing, you could only be put into it if you're  trying to buy a gun.  Meaning, like, if you're saying could it affect other things?  Hey, if you don't go for a gun, that information won't be available to anybody.  But if you're going to a gun, going to purchase a weapon, I think your mental health, the rest  of us, absolutely, our right to be safe and to know that you're mentally qualified overrides 
[00:37:00]  your right to private medical information.  Well, I know in New York, you have to disclose if you have some kind of mental issues.  I mean a database where it's beyond your control.  Well, yeah.  Well, then there's the constitutionality of it.  You know, is, are you going to put yourself in a position by exercising a constitutional  right that will then, in some way, shape, or form, put you up for some kind of, what's 
[00:37:30]  the fucking word I'm looking for?  Scrutiny or a penalty?  Yeah, almost a penalty or, like, put some kind of a stigma on you.  You know, even if you are, too bad.  Yeah.  Here's, again, we talk about the mindset of the constitutioners and what they were thinking  when they did it.  And we have to acknowledge that when they did, when they wrote the constitution, they  didn't even see women voting, blacks voting. 
[00:38:00]  So they were looking at things a lot differently back then.  I don't think that they would have stood up and said, after a school shooting, yeah, we  want anybody to be able to get it, regardless of mental health.  Like, they didn't talk about mental health back then.  Like, if you were considered crazy back then, you were literally probably running around  eating shoes.  You think anyone shot up a school back then?  No.  No.  I mean, it was so rare if it happened.  They probably just lynched you in the town square.  They took care of business.  Plus, it took five minutes to put a bullet in your gun, right?  Yeah, by the time you fucking had the third bullet loaded, everybody else had their guns. 
[00:38:30]  Right.  Loading up your musket.  You were dragged by your fucking, by your awful wooden shoes and hung.  Every kid was out the back door.  You were trying to load that dumb thing.  Yeah, very hard to do a mass shooting with a flint lock.  Look, that must have been, the battles back then must have been boring.  They did a good job of figuring out what to do.  They had, like, lines of people, and the front line would fire as the back line is loading, 
[00:39:00]  and then they'd shift and move back.  The front line would, boom, fire.  They'd move to the back of the line.  The next line would move up, boom, and while you're doing that, they'd be loading again.  Getting picked off?  Holy shit.  Oh, just brutal.  And remember.  Those battles are fucking disgusting.  You talk about the forefathers.  Remember, these were the same people that thought a drum and fife corps was a good idea during battles.  You need the drum and fife.  Imagine our boys in Afghanistan.  Well, who's going to be the fife guy? 
[00:39:30]  We've got to keep up the tradition.  It's a battle.  All right.  There it is.  How important is patriotic music?  How about a gun?  Imagine they went to the Marines.  Okay, look.  We're going old school.  We need a drum and fife corps.  Yeah, we're bringing back the fife.  Could you imagine?  That would be terrible.  Run into battle like that.  Ah, well.  Phones are lit. 
[00:40:00]  Of course.  Let's go to Tom.  Tom?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hey there, Tam.  Hey, old guys.  You asked if schools are any safer today.  In the last couple of days, I've been to three different schools for my job.  They all have those little security buzzers on the door.  You press the button, three magic letters get you in every time, and nobody asks or nobody  comes to see who you really are.  What's the three magic letters?  What do you mean by that?  Without giving it away, I guess, but... 
[00:40:30]  UPS.  Oh, that's all you have to say.  Gotcha.  Man.  You hear the voice say, can I help you?  UPS, and the door opens right up, and you're in, and there's nobody near the door to come  greet you.  You have to walk through the school and find the office and talk to the secretary.  I think that'll change a little bit.  And schools...  I hope so.  There was an article, we read a little bit about it from NPR.  The schools are absolutely a lot safer since Columbine.  That is true.  But I think we could do more. 
[00:41:00]  And you can always find...  They're comfortable, and by getting comfortable, everyone...  You know, hey, the UPS guy, great.  We got a package.  Right.  Nobody thinks to get up, walk down, or maybe, you know, just the secretary poke her head  around.  You know, is there really a brown truck in the driveway?  They just...  It's instinct to let the UPS guy in it.  It won't be as much anymore.  I don't think it won't be either, as much.  You can't get 100%.  There's always going to be a crack or a...  And by the way, it's amazing how...  Thank you, Tom.  Thank you.  The guy says on Twitter, don't understand, you guys have had two full shows on it, but 
[00:41:30]  rail against the news for talking about it.  No, dude.  Oh, God, please.  But we're not even doing that.  I'm not even saying...  We're not saying don't talk about it.  We're saying don't go there and bother these people.  Don't exploit it by showing the shooter's face.  Don't inspire future shooters, you dumbbell.  I was about to say, the one thing the 24-hour news cycles don't do is talk to the people.  And you might go, what do you mean they're talking to the people?  No, they're just fucking finding people that are going to cry on camera.  They don't have a guy like Tom that goes, hey, I want to tell you a little something 
[00:42:00]  that I found out.  That's why I think our coverage is way better.  We're hitting it from every angle.  They don't want to hit it from every angle because it doesn't make good TV.  Because you do sensationalize shit.  We made a living off sensationalizing shit.  We know.  We're not stupid.  Jesus.  You know what else is fucked up about this situation?  You don't know the shit that didn't happen.  Of course.  There's probably quite a few people that wanted to shoot up a fucking school that couldn't 
[00:42:30]  get their hands on a gun.  That just weren't able to.  So they didn't.  I've heard from so many people that have been like, hey, Anthony, why don't you  list all the mass murders that have been stopped by someone with a gun?  It's like you can't because they didn't happen because there's somebody, you know, it could  have.  How about that old codger that pulled his gun out and chased those three guys out the 
[00:43:00]  door of that little fucking casino.  We look in place, whatever it was, that Internet cafe looking.  All right.  It was.  Yeah.  I mean, that might have been.  You don't know.  They might have just come and rob the place and leave.  But you don't know.  They might have just unloaded on everyone in that place.  Sure.  But the guy had a gun and he chased him out.  You don't know it's going to be a mass shooting until it's a mass shooting.  So to say that people haven't thwarted them with their own weapons is a stupid thing to 
[00:43:30]  say.  It has been done.  I listed a fuckload.  I put a link up on Twitter yesterday about a bunch of armed citizens that protected themselves,  their families, other people against robberies, rapists, whatever the fuck it may be.  But there was a fuckload of them.  It happens.  It happens a lot.  But to say that, you know, it never no one ever thwarted a mass murder because you haven't 
[00:44:00]  seen that in the news.  It's because it didn't happen because it was thwarted.  Well, and they do have stories about, you know, catching people ahead of time, but it's  a small little blurb because there's nothing sensational about it.  Just the other day.  So you see it.  It's a tiny little thing.  This kid, you know, was talking some shit and they arrested him and they found this and  that.  And, you know, boom, he wasn't able to do it.  Just the other day, an off-duty sheriff shot a guy that was running and took a shot in a 
[00:44:30]  movie theater.  Right.  Took a shot in the parking lot and he fucking shot him.  There's a guy that had a gun that stopped something bad from happening.  But you never really see those stories.  I'm a retired teacher from Long Island.  We don't have to go to George, but he says on the phone screen here, I work in North Carolina  now.  We have a deputy sheriff who's on our grounds and the surrounding schools every day.  That, as a parent, would make me feel pretty fucking safe. 
[00:45:00]  Let me say hi to Tony.  Tony, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  This is horrible.  My sister's a teacher.  And I've got to tell you something.  Yeah.  You've got a lot of guys with guns who think they're cops and they're not.  That's the problem.  Exactly.  And you know what?  I think they have a...  You know what?  It's a big response to my friends, a cop.  And he says, Tony, he says, you get these guys who want to be cops.  They get their guns.  And they can't handle it because they want to run around like they're fucking Captain  America. 
[00:45:30]  And that's a fucking problem.  I don't want some old guy pulling a gun out in the casino like he's fucking John Wayne  in a movie.  Well, you know what?  Put it this way.  If someone's shooting up a place, I'd rather have the old guy with the gun taking some pot  shots at the fucking guy than have nothing and just be a fucking room full of victims.  I think you're watching too many movies.  And let me tell you...  Oh, stop it.  But dude, Ant just made a good point to you, though.  Like, he just gave you a decent answer. 
[00:46:00]  Too many movies.  I would rather have somebody in there fighting against the...  I don't want my father at 75 pulling a gun out.  He can't even work on a fucking cell phone.  Give me a break.  Would you rather actually just be shot at with nobody with a gun?  So you'd rather just have the guy that wants to kill everyone?  I'd rather have an old cop pull the gun out.  That's what I'd rather have.  What?  You said it before.  The sheriff.  The all-fruity sheriff.  You don't...  Yeah.  Where are those guys?  I don't know.  My question is, are those guys going to be everywhere we are?  How about the old guy at the Internet Cafe thing? 
[00:46:30]  The surveillance video of that?  He did a perfect job of shooting those motherfuckers.  Opie said something great the other day.  Opie, I'm with you.  My sister's got kids.  Let me say this.  This...  Nobody's pointing this finger.  This mother was a fucking whack job.  Mm-hmm.  What the parent thinks stinks.  What are they going to point the fingers at the parents?  Well...  She had the guns.  She trained them how to shoot.  She said, you know what?  I put it all on her fucking feet.  That's...  No, a big part of it.  He's 20.  He wasn't nine.  He was 20.  He knew what he was doing.  Yeah, but...  He was scared of being committed. 
[00:47:00]  He was a self-centered little piglet.  No, I agree with you, Jim.  He's an animal.  But Jim, she gave him the guns.  She taught him how to shoot.  Yeah, she sucks, too.  She did everything.  She did everything.  Yeah, she was trying to bond with him with fucking...  Trying to bond with your lunatic son with guns.  Brilliant idea.  Yeah.  Dummy.  And then, you know, neighbors and stuff were aware to a point, but then what?  You go to the authorities and go, wow, this kid's fucked up and the mom's a little crazy,  too.  Hey, yo, she lives next door to you.  They're going to go, yeah, yeah, great, but unless they commit a crime, there's nothing 
[00:47:30]  we can do.  We've all heard shit like that before, so...  Yeah.  This is making me disgusted, really.  That's what it is.  Of course.  Of course.  There's no easy answer.  Who cops in the schools?  That's what I want.  And I told my sister, go to the principal.  We got to go to your congresswoman.  Let them start working.  I want an armed cop in every...  In my old high school, I was not able to take this as cops.  I'm obsessed with the news channels.  I'll tell you why.  Because you're going to hear over and over again that this problem...  They're basically saying this problem will be taken care of if we have stricter gun control 
[00:48:00]  and we get rid of violent video games.  That's pretty much all they're going to focus on.  But if you talk to the people, and that's the difference with doing TV and radio, you  can just sit here and take phone calls.  You really learn a lot more, and you realize there's way more to the...  To this.  And you guys are right.  The media, it's one big...  How many commercials can I fucking sell?  That's it.  They're not doing shit.  They're trying to go in and...  Turn the TV off, because they're a bunch of fucking hoes, really.  Why talk to someone like you when there's somebody in tears that make for way better TV? 
[00:48:30]  It's horrible.  Well, this is the media.  Blame that.  It's got to go at their feet, too.  They glorify it.  And the problem is they don't ever talk about their own contribution to it.  Like, I'm not saying it's 100% the media's fault, but they never have that conversation  meaningfully where they're going to make a change.  They would rather sit there and watch the rest of us argue and film both sides and pretend  they're impartial. 
[00:49:00]  They're really reprehensible.  We don't pretend to do that.  We don't pretend to be news.  We're just fucking guys giving our opinions.  We're not a news organization, Piers.  Not one of these...  Well, not one, but in...  All right.  You got to keep it fair.  In general, you don't see these guys giving their opinions on this thing.  No.  You just don't.  Wolf Blitzer hasn't made one opinion.  Not one.  And he's one of the big shots over there at CNN.  Wolf Blitzer.  Not one.  I mean, Piers, you know, he does give his opinions. 
[00:49:30]  So I do respect that.  But I do think there's absolutely some dishonesty in him as well.  I just think, like you said, I told my sister, these senekas, and I tell her, I said, I want  cops in front of a school with a gun.  That's what I want.  All right.  You want to go through?  This guy's putting a lot of his faith in the police.  Okay.  That's good.  Well, I would too, though.  Before I arm someone in the actual school.  Of course.  I don't know if they would have enough training to take care of a situation.  But, yeah, I mean, it'll cost so much money to put a cop at every school. 
[00:50:00]  That's why that will never happen.  There's a liability issue and all that shit.  They're going to money for fucking everything.  Well.  And they're going to round up these mental patients.  Go on Queens Boulevard.  This guy's a putz.  Queens Boulevard.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Yeah, but he's engaged me, and I like this.  Because I have something on this.  I went to B&H.  We all love going to B&H for our electronics cameras and shit.  The acidic Jew place.  Love those Jews. 
[00:50:30]  And it's in a sketchy area, and I'm walking back to the subway.  I saw so many fucking crazy people, Tony.  Guess what?  They're not.  In general, they're not the problem.  I know what those people are about.  It's the.  It's.  Huh?  You got to stop around them.  Some of them are off kilter.  I walk right through them, and I know what they're about.  It's the ones you don't know what they're about.  That they have the appearance that they're a normal kid and a little quiet, but there's  some shit going on. 
[00:51:00]  Those type of people scare me way more than the lunatic on the street.  But, I mean, with that said, you're probably right.  We should round some of them up.  Because they can't.  Anybody who's on the street all day and night.  And you got to feel bad for them.  And that means they're broken.  There's something not right there.  Peeing themselves.  Thank you.  Come on.  You know.  I mean, it's hard.  But these people are not able to function in society.  You got to get them off.  I wouldn't want a junior coming out of school.  Can you imagine you coming out of school?  All right.  All right.  So I had it with this guy. 
[00:51:30]  What?  What's going on here?  All right.  I got to go, man.  Yeah, you do.  You're telling them?  He's a putz.  Punch it out, man.  Jesus.  A lot of these guys are walking around like...  What are you doing?  This is crazy.  Exactly.  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  I want cops everywhere.  I want a cop in every seat.  I want a cop in...  You know, you got to get a cop in every school.  Anthony, what do you want?  What do you want to do? 
[00:52:00]  Hey, Manuel.  Hey, Manuel.  That's true.  Oh, you see that picture?  Oh, Kate Upton.  I saw those today.  Kate Upton's kind of chunky.  Not chunky, but she's got some meat on her.  We like to call it ample.  She's ample.  She's bosomy.  She looks nice in the paper today.  Yeah, she does look good.  Yes.  All right.  Well, I mean, to that guy's point, not that it matters too much, but we let all those  people out a long fucking time ago, didn't we?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  Most of those people you see fucking walking around like lunatics, they were in homes.  Yeah.  They mainstreamed them, it's called.  Mainstream.  Was that the term?  Yep.  No kidding.  Let's mainstream them and assimilate them to society, and then, you know, that didn't  quite work, so now you get people that occasionally just get bashed over the head with a fucking  brick, pushed onto train tracks.  Eh, whatever.  Yeah, whatever.  Wow, look at those fucking...  What?  Yeah, she's fucking good. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, she is just a big-titted girl.  A dish.  She's a dish.  Yeah, I would have liked to see her with a fucking...  She's like Ursula Andress.  Ursula Andress.  I want a cop on every tip.  Oh, would I suckle those?  Now we got to all tweet her fucking ample boosoms.  I would just suckle them and call her mommy.  I would want her to hold my head.  I would want her to cup my head like a baby in a babushka.  You think she would be creeped out by that?  Some women would either love it or just want you never to call them again. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't get this whole mentality where people are completely against the idea that if you're  in a room with a gunman who's just shooting people randomly, that they would rather just  have that than a person in there also with a gun that is shooting at the gunman.  Like, I can't fathom that whole ideology.  Well, that's the hypocrisy of the whole thing now, isn't it?  It's crazy.  Yeah, because I'm not a rah-rah gun guy like yourself, but I was in a restaurant last night 
[00:54:00]  and I was thinking.  Yeah.  And my thought was if some, you know, maniac came in there, this is my thought.  And it was at dinner last night.  I go, man, I sure hope someone in here has a gun.  Just something.  So if, yeah, somebody comes in.  And I think a lot of people would think that way.  Yeah.  They want less guns, but if they're in a situation, I bet you, if the people were being honest,  they would be hoping that someone had a gun. 
[00:54:30]  If someone just starts shooting and you're under a table and he's just like doing that  stalking thing that they tend to do with as they just shooting people one by one, before  he gets to you, wouldn't you be like, please, someone shoot this guy.  Yeah.  Could someone please just shoot, at least shoot at this guy so he fucking gets distracted  for a second?  Anything but him just walking around with impunity shooting people.  I think what it, excuse me, what it is is people are playing the odds. 
[00:55:00]  Like they put, the odds of being in a mass shooting are very low, but the odds of being  in a room with someone else who has a gun could happen to you almost every day.  And I think that's where people, because they don't, people can't picture themselves  in a mass shooting.  Right.  They think they can, but they're thinking of the other 50 times they go to the movies  and nothing happens.  They don't want the old guy with the gun.  They're not thinking about the time where a guy walks in in a Joker hat and starts shooting  everybody because he needs attention.  I'd rather have just somebody in there that's at least trying to remedy the problem of somebody 
[00:55:30]  just shooting without any, without any distraction.  He could just keep blasting people because no one's in there to, to, to help.  Mm-hmm.  Frightening.  That would have to be the most fucking frightening thing ever to just be like powerless to do  anything.  Oh man.  Well, I've had a gun pointed at me one time and it was scary.  Like for real.  It was horrifying. 
[00:56:00]  It was scary.  You were in the jacuzzi a long time.  I wanted you out.  They remember that you said, put this in your mouth or else you meant the gun.  Of course.  Uh, what happened?  I was, I told you the McDonald's story.  Yeah, fuck yeah.  The robbery with my ex-girlfriend.  We were sitting there and the guys ran in with parkas.  Don't shoot.  No, no.  Very scary.  Let me ask, let me ask you something.  Were you hoping someone else had a gun in that joint?  I didn't think in, in that spirit of period of time.  Right.  Um, no, I wasn't.  You were just hoping your girl wouldn't get lippy? 
[00:56:30]  Raped.  Yeah.  I thought she was going to get raped.  No, I knew she wouldn't get lippy.  I was supposed to get raped.  Because, you know, women tend to get lippy and then want you to take care of the situation.  They really are idiots.  Oh my God.  Will you shut your mouth, please?  Quiet.  Wait, what's the gun?  Wait, what's the gun?  What's the hamburger?  Come on.  You've got to get cops.  I know they.  I know.  I'm coughing.  All right, food's here.  We should take a break.  You've got to get cops.  We've got a busy show.  David Tell coming in today.  Ooh.  One of our favorites, man. 
[00:57:00]  He really needs to do this radio show more.  And it seems like he's starting to do that.  That's great.  And Judd Apatow from This Is 40 coming in today.  Oh.  To talk about his movie.  Yes.  To eat.  And we're going to go to break with the femur bit for Brian Regan.  Can I have tissues?  Why not?  We could do that.  Nurse finally comes in.  How are you doing tonight?  I'm on a gurney.  Do you have a painkiller or something?  This is killing me. 
[00:57:30]  So she goes, how would you describe your pain?  I don't know if you remember that part.  I don't know if you remember that part.  Ouch.  What are we playing that pyramid game?  Excruciating.  Horrific.  Horrific.  I would rather have shards of glass in my eyes. 
[00:58:00]  How do I convey this to you?  So she asks, how would you rate your pain?  Four stars.  Two enthusiastic thumbs up.  She goes, how would you rate it on a scale of one to ten with ten being the worst?  Well, you know, saying a low number isn't going to help you.  Oh, I'm a two.  Maybe the high ones. 
[00:58:30]  You could give me a baby aspirin and cut it in half.  Maybe a Flintstone vitamin and I'll be out of your hair.  You can go ten to all the threes and fours and such.  If anyone's saying such ridiculous numbers.  I couldn't bring myself to say ten, though, because I had heard the worst pain a human can endure is getting the femur bone cracked in half.  I don't know if that's true, but I thought if it is, they have exclusive rights to ten. 
[00:59:00]  And now I'm thinking, what was I worried about?  Is there like a femur ward at the hospital they would have heard about me and hobble into my room?  Who the hell?  Have the audacity to say he was on a level ten!  You know nothing about ten. 
[00:59:30]  Give me a sledgehammer and let me show you what ten is all about, Mr. Tommy A.  No!  No!  No!  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel on Sirius XM.  Ahoy, mateys!  Time to launch back onto the seven seas with your favorite aqua adventurer, Captain Louie!  It was my first day in the boat.  I just bought it, but it's this big fucking boat with two engines and it's really complicated to drive. 
[01:00:00]  I took Chris Rock and my manager out on it.  We went out to the Statue of Liberty and there was this thing floating in the water.  Chris saw it.  I said, what is that?  And it was this big thing and it was dark.  It was night.  It was like one in the morning.  So it looked like, you know, like a big round raft.  That's what it looked like to me.  And I yelled over, hey, is anyone in that boat?  And then we noticed that it was coming towards us, like kind of with some speed.  And Chris goes, get the fuck away from that thing.  Like it was creepy.  So I backed away from it and I put a light on it and it was, it was like, it looked like a giant manhole cover sticking out of the river. 
[01:00:30]  This was the weirdest night fucking ever.  And it's right by the Statue of Liberty and it's like, I don't know, 20 feet across and it's moving.  It's leaving a wake.  So I call up and then this woman came on and says, New York Harbor Coast Guard, give me your phone number.  So I give her my number and this guy calls.  He goes, describe it as well as you can.  I go, I don't want to cause a problem, but it looks like the hatch of a submarine and it's headed towards Lower Manhattan.  That's what I'm seeing.  And I'm sure it's not that. 
[01:01:00]  But my main concern is it's not lit and it could cream anything that hits it's going down.  And the guy goes, all right, well, I'll call the boat and send them to you.  So he hangs up and like 20 minutes later, there's nobody there.  So anyway, I call back and they're not sending anybody.  And I, and I, at one point I got crazy and I was like, you are the Coast Guard and I am saying to you now, there's a submarine attacking Lower Manhattan.  I'm saying it.  And they're like, we're trying to get park police over here.  I'm like, send a fucking helicopter.  And he kept asking me to hover. 
[01:01:30]  We kept hovering around it and stuff.  And then finally this big police boat comes, shines like a massive light on it.  And then he calls me on the radio.  Hey, Captain, are you the one who reported this?  And I go, yeah.  And he goes, it's a mooring ball.  It's been there since 1965.  Mooring balls are so you don't have to throw an anchor down.  You just hang, hook up to it.  And I go, what if you don't see it?  And the guy goes, well, most people navigating those waters know what the fuck they're doing.  I have no business being on the water.  And I would have hit it if I hadn't stopped at the Statue of Liberty to show it off to Chris and them. 
[01:02:00]  Maybe not quite the adventure you were looking for.  Well, shiver me timbers and all that bullshit.  Ah, pig leg!  This fucking parrot just took a shit on me!  God damn it!  Sirius XM  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  I was feeling pretty good for La La La La 
[01:02:30]  Taking my time on the La La La La  Snowfall down in the La La La La  Everybody's singing like La La La La  Decking all the halls with the La La La La  Making my way to the La La La La  You're kind of enjoying it this time, aren't you?  La La La La La La La La  We could all use a few more La La La's in our life.  Why is Bond?  You know that.  That's the problem with this world.  Turn this up.  I like to drink a little beer. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the people in the light  All the children in the light  Singing home, home, home  That's what I'm saying. 
[01:03:30]  We can fade out of this.  The Shepherd of Leaves.  I am a fan of the La La La song, for real.  I hate the La La song.  I was thinking of the Shepherd of Leaves the other day.  The Shepherd of Leaves.  And I'm obsessing about this video, which was done by the same guy that just penned the song you heard.  Come, Mortimer.  And I need to know how this video went.  And I'm sure it doesn't end with a big, you know, splash.  I don't think we've ever gotten to the end.  No, we never get to the end.  It is.  We hear about Mortimer. 
[01:04:00]  Mortimer.  Oh.  There's Mortimer.  The Shepherd of Leaves.  The Shepherd of Leaves is in the woods.  A little stream.  The Shepherd of Leaves is a lunatic.  And he's helping the leaves along for their journey.  They fell off the trees, but now they've got to go downstream.  Downstream.  It's kind of a fish thing.  There they go.  I understand the concept.  But I need to know how the video ends.  We never get to the end.  No, we never get to the end.  How long is the video?  Only six minutes.  Well, how about we just play the last minute? 
[01:04:30]  Sure.  Is that possible?  That's a good idea.  We never really saw.  You're right.  We've done about half the video where he, you know, names all the leaves and they all  have different personalities and blah, blah, gets stuck over there.  Don't get stuck over there.  We've never seen this part.  All right.  This is the end right here?  It's the last minute.  You see all your leaves down at the leaf pile.  Right. 
[01:05:00]  Just keep going.  You'll make it.  Try to stay away from the science.  Science is very dangerous.  You know that, though.  You don't need reminders, do you?  You spend such a good time.  A good deal of their time sleeping.  And how many people notice that leaves also whistle all the time.  They're always whistling.  They have to hear. 
[01:05:30]  It sounds like a light wind.  They sleep and whistle.  That's what a woman gets, which is all tied up.  You know how to get there.  They're going to be murdered by him.  Just not because of this.  Psycho babble.  That's it, man.  How does the song start?  What song?  What's the song for this?  It actually starts as a song that's not as bad.  And then he wrecks it with his fucking idiocy. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, right, right, right.  Hey, little Travis.  And there's a shot of him just kind of on the bank of the stream looking at his leaves.  Oh, the Travis leaf is watching the mama leaf.  Oh, no.  Have sex with the leaf with pay us.  Sorry, Travis.  I love his voice.  I really do.  I don't mind this song as much.  From a bench in the town to a bench in the trees.  You don't like this yet?  No.  From the fallen old snow over fallen old me.  It's going to get to your cold heart, man.  Oh, this voice. 
[01:06:30]  What gets to your cold heart?  Oh, plenty of stuff.  Not this, though.  It's going to get to your boat on an empty old sea.  You leak till you're empty.  When empty, you're free.  I'd like to climb like a golden flower.  Sunlight the bread.  Until it's my power in a ballroom dream.  It's very nice. 
[01:07:00]  Not down to the old river queen.  The old river queen?  Why is it with her?  She'd sing me a song of my dreams.  Why?  He puts the humorous sound in it.  Distracting.  He does leave you wanting more.  Is that a whole song or is he just wrote the opening for this and then he fucking ten minutes  of this psychotic...  It literally is like watching the fucking Blair Witch Project. 
[01:07:30]  That's right.  I feel like I have to shit when I watch this.  I'm standing up hoarding on a duty.  Get in line.  All right, Philip, good work.  Johnny, nice to see you.  As they go downstream, the leaves in the water.  He's like the mangala of leaves.  Find two twin leaves.  We've got to get to Mortimer and then we'll shut up.  Douglas, Douglas Leaf.  Douglas Leaf. 
[01:08:00]  Charles, always going under the water.  His wife, Mary.  Mary, Charles, Mary got stuck here.  Mary got stuck.  I don't know these ones.  I don't know these ones.  Sorry.  He ran out of names.  Yeah.  Oh, strangers.  Welcome.  All in a line.  Thank you.  Right through here.  All in a line.  And down. 
[01:08:30]  That's the way to do it.  I tried to go the other way.  Dead end.  It's not good up that way.  You just stop.  If anyone wants to stop, needs a break.  You can go up this way.  Needs a break.  It's not likely to rain and so you'll probably just end up there for the rest of your line.  If you want to keep moving, this way here.  Down here.  There you go.  Where's Mortimer?  I don't know any of these. 
[01:09:00]  I don't know who they are.  He doesn't know who they are.  Oh, Mortimer right up there.  Mortimer.  There's Mortimer.  Mortimer.  I feel like I know Mortimer.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Mortimer Leaf.  Sleeping again.  He's sleeping.  Wake up, Mortimer.  Spends a lot of time on Mortimer.  Mortimer Leaf.  Can you hear me?  Mortimer Leaf.  Can you hear me?  Anyway.  I want a fucking nut.  But I wouldn't be really bad if you didn't make it into the stream, but then he spins  it later and says, look, they're just sleeping. 
[01:09:30]  The ones that don't make it into the stream are just sleeping.  They're sleeping.  I think this guy shares your annoyance of sleeves.  Let's say hi to John.  John.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Good morning, John.  Hey, Ronan says every winter the past couple of years has played the sleeves ice skating  winter story.  It goes on for about an hour.  Oh, my God.  Really?  Yeah.  They play it like every Christmas when they do like their best tub over the weekend. 
[01:10:00]  Oh, that's why I've missed it.  Is it like the Alice's Restaurant of winter skating?  For Ronan Fez, yes.  Yeah.  Starts as a little boy, and then as he gets older, he met a girl, and, you know, he comes  back every year to the same place.  It's in real time.  That sounds like a nice little story.  Can we play the first part of it?  Or no?  Or is that stupid?  Why don't we?  Is there more to that song, or is that the whole song?  That's it.  He never goes back to the song.  Why doesn't he?  Well, maybe he has a whole song that he just used at the beginning of. 
[01:10:30]  He's one of those prolific guys, so he probably has a lot of pieces of different songs.  Well, he's dancing with the River Queen.  I want to know what happens to the River Queen.  Let her fucking feet in box smell like river mud.  She's been sitting there with pinworms in her hiney.  I hate the River Queen.  The River Queen's actually a guy in a dress.  Well, Mentality Mag on Twitter makes a very good point.  Opie, are you playing this dreck to highlight the issue of mental illness that is widespread  throughout the country? 
[01:11:00]  Yes.  And it does steal.  That's the song I like.  I have to admit that.  I think Anthony likes it.  I like his voice.  Oh, I don't.  His lyrics are a little annoying, though.  Like, the fa-la-la-la.  Could be a really good song, but it's too stupid.  I kind of like the fa-la-la-la.  I want to like it, because I hear it enough.  He's a wackadoo.  He's crazy.  He's bad shit.  If he would pull it all in a little bit, he could be mainstream with a song, I think.  You know what you ought to do?  Put Sleeves and Grey Wolf together and finish that Tippy Tom song. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, God.  I bet you they could do something with that.  Do you?  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Tom, you're tipping.  Are you tipping over, Tom?  The steps.  Tom, throw down the steps.  Not a bad idea.  Why not?  See what they could do with it.  He'll get the spirit of it.  Or you know what?  Grey Wolf is, let's say he's done.  His part's done.  Maybe have Sleeves work around what Grey Wolf already did.  Oh, yes.  Tippy Tom.  That might be the way to do it.  Oh, Mortimer.  Do people know the Grey Wolf song by now? 
[01:12:00]  Mortimer Leaf.  We get listeners coming and going all the time.  We get new ones.  We get the old ones saying, fuck you guys.  It's just constantly growing, this thing.  Do most people know the Grey Wolf song?  Oh, Mort.  Yeah, I love that song.  Just one verse short.  We don't write a book about Grey Wolf.  We'll call it One Verse Short.  Yep.  And just have the book be one page.  And go, look what this asshole almost did.  The end.  Not as annoying as the homeless guy that would just fiddle with his guitar.  Oh, that fucking, he looked like the guy that he did ride, Crambole. 
[01:12:30]  Remember that?  Papa Rock.  Papa Rock was a turd.  One of my favorite moments is coming back on Saturday Radio.  It was just your level of annoyance.  That was so fucking funny.  The guy could never get it together enough to play anything.  He was just.  Look at you.  You're fiddling again.  You're fiddling.  He's just adjusting.  Oh.  How long has that been, Iraq?  Let me check.  Eric found the.  Have we ever done a homeless special?  Yes.  Oh, we have.  Okay. 
[01:13:00]  Not a Tippy Tom special.  Like a homeless special in general.  Okay.  Because we've had some classics over the years.  Eric found the sleeps thing that Ron and Fez play every year.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It's called The Christmas Skater.  Oh, no.  It's short.  If you want to play it.  40 minutes?  45.  45 fucking minutes of that lunatic.  Of what?  Can we hear the setup at least?  That skating song thing he does.  See how much you can get there?  Look, we're moving into winter now.  Oh, man.  That's not short, dude.  You said short.  Oh.  Can I?  I got to hear the first minute. 
[01:13:30]  Where's Sam?  I just heard moans all over the place.  But we got to hear the first minute.  Yeah.  Yeah, we do.  Even I want to hear it.  All right.  Sleeps.  This is something Ron and Fez play every Christmas or around Christmas.  I'm out.  I'm out.  Well, I rode on the carousel  Till my horse tired  I threw down set balloons 
[01:14:00]  Till I won  And I drank all the memory  Drove bummed out  45 minutes of this  Till it seemed like I  It's just the intro  Oh, does it  What is it?  Fucking kick in?  No, man.  It starts with a song  And then it gets into a storm  What a dirge  Terrible  He's such a fan 
[01:14:30]  I said welcome to my one last  I said welcome to my one last  What a dirge  Here we go  You're listening  I was enjoying that  He always fucks it up  With his stories  And the void  Oh  It's in my right ear  That's good pronunciation  There's a little creek  Or stream 
[01:15:00]  That pours down the hill  Behind my cabin  Which is it?  Eventually  Gathers up into a river  Or brook  Alright  And every winter  It freezes  Or summer  Or it doesn't  Or the bottom  Or low enough  Or the summer  Or 4th of July  Walk down the mountain  In the snowy woods  Around the narrow  Town going  Cascade to the frozen stream  Until finally  There is some leveling out 
[01:15:30]  And the creek  Or stream  Is no longer rope like  Or river  Or eddies  Or sculpted over the rocks  Or under them  Under them  Isthmus  But smooths out  Or roughs up  In a blanket of ice  And weights  Or it doesn't  Or I don't  Or my skates  Which I have brought along with me  Or I've forgotten  Or they're around my arm  For such a skating purpose  Good idiot  If I were a much younger man  Or a good skating boy  That's the first man right there 
[01:16:00]  Alright  Wow  If he was a much younger man  What would he do?  Oh you want to keep going?  It's 45 minutes  We've got to stop it somewhere  Yes  Alice's restaurant  I just want to know  What he would do  After he was a younger man  Iraq  Alright let's go  A skating boy  With roughhouser friends  Roughhouser  I'm sure we'd be having a dare  Much earlier  On the very steep  Sloping parts of the river  And we would fall  And crash along the snow banks  And be battered  We'd fillet each other  And throw rocks at negroes 
[01:16:30]  Yes  Our little penises  Could barely stick out of our snowsuits  But we found them with our mouths  Much like a pig  Looking for truffles  They look like little frozen pinkies  With snot dripping off them  Little frozen kissable pinkies  And the little shuka shuka of the snow pants  As you nervously shift back and forth  As your friend kisses your little wet pinky  Good luck with Ronnie B man 
[01:17:00]  Because you're both  Are going against him  What?  Ronnie B says  It's the best one man show  He's ever seen  I guess he's done this  As a one man show  Really?  Yep  He has an amazing voice  I say one thing  He should be doing books  On tape and stuff  Oh fuck yeah  His voice is  There's something about it  And then this guy writes  I imagine sleeves  Looking like Gandalf  The great from The Hobbit  And Lord of the Rings  Yeah he's got that look  Where does he live?  He's got one of those  Wacky old hats  He lives in the woods 
[01:17:30]  By a creek  Or a river  Or a pond  Weren't you listening to the story?  Long hour  Gray  Yeah  Rough housing friends  Yes  I live in a tower  In Isengard  Fucking lunatic  Who would frotic in the snow  Yes  Where's the buzz on The Hobbit?  It's the biggest  December opening in history  I think right?  It's already doing  Really really well  So there's a good buzz  Oh yeah  Alright good  Yeah I had a massive opening  Weekend  Fucking Bobby Kelly  Tweeted a picture  I guess he got  A copy for his consideration 
[01:18:00]  For the Oscars I gather  Of The Hobbit?  Yeah he's able to watch it at home  What the fuck?  Why doesn't that  Fucking asshole  Come over my house  And watch it in my theater?  Could you put it on Fox  For one second  There's a black guy  I'm gonna guess  Whether for God  I don't know  Oh  Big big big change  Saved seven people  I want to move on  To Maria Salazar  She was just 12  When she also received  Amanda's right kidney  Maria you're now 18  And your sister Marsha  Is with you  Because Maria's English  Is not as 
[01:18:30]  As young as yours  But Maria  You look fantastic  Yeah it's a different story  Excuse me for  It's about organ  Basically  A lot of people lie  Because this teenager  Died tragically  Wow  Yes  So we got  We go back to Piers Morgan  There was a heated exchange  On CNN last night  And we got it  Larry Pratt  This way Piers  Who's Larry Pratt?  Piers Leaf  Who is that?  Who's the Larry Pratt? 
[01:19:00]  Mr. Pratt  What's the matter?  Bugs got your tongue?  Who'd be the Larry Pratt?  He's the  Executive Director  Of Gun Owners of America  So uh  Oh boy  They're gonna not agree  Oh no  Incredibly  Gun sales  Are surging  In the wake of the massacre  At Sandy Hook Elementary School  Colorado and Virginia  Each set one day records  For background checks  Over the weekend  As thousands of people  Lined up to buy  Guns themselves  My next guest says  There is blood on the hands 
[01:19:30]  But of lawmakers  Who voted to ban  Guns from schools  Larry Pratt  Is the Executive Director  Of Gun Owners of America  He says that if more people  With guns  Had been at Sandy Hook  Elementary School  Most of the victims  Might still be alive  Mr. Pratt  You'll be aware  That your comments  Have ignited  A lot of debate  Um  Can you try and explain  To me  Why you believe  The answer to this  Is to arm teachers  Well the alternative  Is what we have seen  Yes 
[01:20:00]  Where people were reduced  To waiting to be murdered  Without able to  Being able to do  Anything effective  To protect themselves  Or the adults  To protect the children  So  It  It  Seems so obvious  That since we have  Concealed carry laws  In all of our country  Now  People can  Get a concealed firearm  And yet we  Have laws that say  Not in schools  And so  In the very places  That have been  Sought out  By monsters  Such as the  Murderer of these 
[01:20:30]  Adults and children  We're saying  No  We don't want you  To be able to  Defend yourself  It's better that you  Just sit there  And wait to be killed  And we find that  Morally  Incomprehensible  And deeply disturbing  That the desire  To defend life  Has been so  Cast aside  Into whatever  Political correctness  Views guns  As the ultimate evil  Evil's in our hearts  Not in the guns  Again 
[01:21:00]  Just what I was  Saying before  Why would you  Rather have  Just the bad guy  Shooting everyone  Have a gun  Than anyone else  Have one  Now  Obviously you would  Want somebody  That's well trained  And knows what  They're doing  Shit like that  Not just  Dole out guns  To random teachers  That's stupid  But an administrator  In the school  Something like that  Much like the pilots  Had to take 
[01:21:30]  Safety and training  Courses and guns  When they put  Pistols in the  Cockpits  Same thing with  An administrator  In the school  Somebody  Fucking somebody  In the school  That can have  A response time  Of a few seconds  To when these  Things happen  Instead of just  Depending on the  Police  Who are going to  Take a while  To get there  And the gunman  Just has free reign  To kill people  So what's the  Fucking problem  Why is that  A problem  We live in this  World  If you want to 
[01:22:00]  Say it's a  Problem because  You don't want  To think that  We live in a  World where we  Need to arm  Some people  In schools  Well sorry  Sorry to blow  Up your nice  Little fucking  Perfect world  Well peers  Will answer that  For you  The AR-15  As we've now  Seen from the  Last three  Mass shootings  In America  Aurora the  Shopping mall  In Oregon  And now  Sandy Hook  School is the  Preferred choice  A weapon for  Disturbed young  Men who want  To commit mass  Atrocity  It can fire  Hundreds of  Bullets at  Rapid speed  If you have  The right  Magazines 
[01:22:30]  The president  Of the United  States has  Indicated he  Wants to ban  Assault weapons  Like this  What is your  View?  I think we need  To ban gun control  Laws that keep  People from being  Able to protect  Themselves  The problem is not  Going to go away  If we ban this  Or that gun  We've tried that  That doesn't work  Doesn't even work  In England  You've had mass  Murders there  All over Europe  There have been mass  Murders  The solution  The solution is for  People to be able  To defend themselves  At the point of  The crime  And not wait for 
[01:23:00]  20 minutes for  The police to come  After everybody's  Dead  Mr. Pratt was an  Absolute lie  Can you pause for  One second  You see the way  Pierce is reacting  To this guy  Having a level  Headed discussion  Like  Pierce is not  Being  That's not the way  A good interviewer  Reacts  No  He's a hothead  Though  Everyone knows  He's a hothead  And it's very easy  To get to Pierce  Write him today  He'll write you back  And with this issue  He's like  Blinded  He's just fucking  Blinded  As much as he thinks 
[01:23:30]  The gun people  The gun nuts  As they call them  Are blinded  He's blinded  The other end  Of the spectrum  Absolute lie  The gun murder rate  In countries like  Britain  Or Germany  Or Australia  Who've all suffered  Massacres  Many years ago  Of similar nature  Have  They are  35 people  Killed a year  Your country  Is 12,000  Your murder rate  Is lower than ours  That is true  Lower  It's 35 against 12,000 
[01:24:00]  In Australia  Your violent crime rate  Your violent crime rate  Is higher than ours  As is the violent crime rate  In Australia  America is not  The wild west  That you are depicting  We only have the problem  In our cities  And unhappily  In our schools  Where people like you  Have been able  To get laws  Put on the books  That keep people  From being able  To defend themselves  I honestly  Don't understand  Why you  Would rather  Have people  Be victims of a crime  Than be able 
[01:24:30]  To defend themselves  It's incomprehensible  Incomprehensible  That guy  Even if you don't  Agree  Is making an  Intelligent argument  That's the point  Though  That I was just  Making  Also  It doesn't make  Any sense to me  That people  Wouldn't want  People to defend  Themselves  It's not  A case of  People that  Have legal guns  That are concealed  Gun owners  Pulling the guns out  And shooting people  That isn't happening  It's not the case  Of a murderer  Coming in 
[01:25:00]  With a rifle  And shooting up  A room  And having  A guy with  A concealed weapon  Pull his gun out  And make the  Situation worse  I don't think  That's ever  Happened by the way  I honestly  Can't think of a case  Where a shooting  Has been happening  And someone  Pulled out a gun  To stop it  And made it worse  And made the  Situation worse  Oh my god  This guy's crazy  He's joining in  It's not like  Some guy goes  Hey someone's  Killing a bunch  Of people here  Let me join in  Because I have a gun  It doesn't happen  So where's the line  Should we all  Just get guns  No  That's what people 
[01:25:30]  Say too  All get guns  No  I mean some people  Aren't responsible enough  Some people don't  Want the responsibility  Some people don't  Want to own guns  Some people are  Afraid of guns  The line is  If you want  To have a gun  To protect yourself  You should train  You should know  Everything about the gun  And you should  Know the responsibility  It takes to own one  But you should be  Allowed to  And you should be  Allowed to defend  Yourself and other  People in a case 
[01:26:00]  Something like this  Happens  You shouldn't be  The one restricted  From carrying the gun  When the guy that  Is going to be  Killing a bunch of  People doesn't  Give a shit  About the laws  But what about  The people that  Don't do any  Of those things  What do we do  With those people  Then they have to  Depend on the  Police  Or maybe somebody  That is an  Armed citizen  In a situation  It's like  Everyone is allowed  To be a parent  But then they  Just are  Shitty parents  Well that's true  I don't know  It's 
[01:26:30]  I can't  I can't  Understand that  Mindset  That you don't  Want people to  Be able to  Defend themselves  It doesn't  Make sense  I don't think  Armed citizens  Make the world  Or this country  A more dangerous  Place  It's been proven  Otherwise  Proven otherwise  Gotta have tougher  Laws as far as  People using guns  And shit  Like how  Mental health checks  Even if they can  Steal guns  Mental health checks  Well if you use 
[01:27:00]  A gun in a crime  Yeah  That's gotta be  A huge fucking  Penalty  That's what I mean  But it's not  No  They usually  Plead it down  It's a slap on  The wrist for  Guys that live  In that world  Yeah  Wouldn't be a slap  On the wrist for me  Or a lot of us  But for a guy  That lives in that world  That's like  Ah well  Risk of doing business  You always hear  Might have to do  A couple years  In the joint  Yeah you hear  Oh you did three years  On a weapons charge  And it's  Three years  Fuck that 
[01:27:30]  A lot of people  Out there  Would laugh at that shit  It's no big deal  To them  Yeah  It's a big deal  To me  If I had to do  Three years  In prison  Fuck  Certainly could  You know  Fix that part of it  I could do that  Standing on my head  Yeah you hear that  All the time  Love that one  I know  Have you ever seen  Someone in prison  Standing on their head  Going I told you  I can't do a head  Stand for more than  Five seconds  You should go to prison  Now if you make  The sentence  Longer  Would that deter  Some of these people  I'm just saying some 
[01:28:00]  No  You don't think so  These are people  That want to die  Fuck the sentence  No I know  Those cases are  Helpless in general  But just knocking down  You know  Gun violence  Plaxico  How many years  Did he do  He had a three year sentence  He did what  18 months  Or something like that  Yeah  Something like that  So that's kind of easy  Even for an athlete  Yeah  He missed a year and a half  Right  Did he do it on his head  He pretty much did it  On his head  Yeah because his leg  Was aging  It was on his head  Yeah his legs  He had to stay off  His legs for a while 
[01:28:30]  But I mean  What if you move that up  To a you know  It has to be five years  Guy do every fucking day  In five years  Would that deter some people  Um  I don't know  I don't know  Because then you fall  Into those things  Where that dumb woman  That came to New York  With a legal gun  In her state  Didn't know she was  You know  Illegal in New York  And she asked  Asked the cops  Where do I put my gun  If I can't bring it  To the World Trade Center  Memorial  And then you got  Mandatory gun laws  And then she's 
[01:29:00]  Obligated to sit  Five years in prison  Alright fair enough  But that's the responsibility  Of owning a gun  You know all the fucking rules  You got to  Absolutely  And you've been to  A bunch of states  Since you've been a gun owner  You're not just  Fucking wandering around  Willy nilly  Just assuming that  The laws are the same  In every state  No  You know I feel  Kind of bad for that woman  But she was kind of stupid  Well she didn't go to jail anyway  No she didn't go to jail  Right  But I mean that won't happen  Every time  When you get laws like that  But how do you not know  You should know  But the thing is 
[01:29:30]  Is five years in prison  For that woman  Really realistic  Or will it  Will it help anything  That she's in there  For five years  That would be  People fucking study the laws  That's for sure  And take it even more seriously  Which they should  Yeah maybe a few  Are going to get caught  Where it's like  Ah fuck  It's too bad  You got to do five  But what else  Are we going to do  As a society  And that is my point  Like people really need  To educate themselves  I think people have to  Up their responsibility  That's my little funny  Ha ha joke line  I do on Twitter  When people ask me  I'm thinking of getting a gun 
[01:30:00]  What should I get  And I say  An education  See  Because that's the first thing  They should do  Is educate themselves  But what about  We don't need no education  Oh  All in all  Yeah  You know  And I like pudding  Ah  You can't have any pudding  I'll have meat  I'll have meat first  Than pudding after  Oh you're going to eat  Your meat first  I will  Always  I'm not a big fan  Of pudding after I eat meat  Just a little strange  I love some fucking  Tapioca pudding  Some vanilla  What's better than 
[01:30:30]  Chocolate pudding  That's cold  With fucking  Whipped cream on it  We've discussed  I don't like the color combination  Skin no skin  Yes  Skin  Absolutely  Always  There you go  Big boy  As long as it's clean  Yeah  Because it's  Chocolate pudding  With skin  You know you guys  Are talking about snacks  Eric brought you guys  Some snacks  Oh the vanilla fucking  No why  I'm trying to lose weight  I had a discussion 
[01:31:00]  In the locker room yesterday  About my working out technique  What did he say  He said you've been trying  For years  Give up  Enjoy some goldfish  Why are you  Oh boy  What is this going after  Somebody's weight on the show  How funny would it be  If I went to  How great would it be  If I went to  Human resources  And got Eric fired  And all he can say  Is but but but but  As they're kicking him  Out of the building  That would be the greatest day  Making fun of my weight  Is not a program  You shouldn't do that  Iraq  Eric  Oh  You got goldfish 
[01:31:30]  Yes  This one is  S'mores  I don't want  I'll take less  This one is vanilla cupcake  That's the one I had  The other night  That I talked about  Here comes a giant  Palm leaf  Eric  Eric leaf  Coming down  This one is cookies and cream  Oh that's the one  Wait wait wait  You don't have any real goldfish  No salted ones  And the cookies and cream  Oreos  This is some of the stuff  I had at  Iraq's house  The other night  Jesus  Go with the vanilla  That was the one  That I noticed  I only like real goldfish  I don't like these  No you're going to like them 
[01:32:00]  Just try them  They're delicious  Expand your palate  Have one  Can you have just one  Yes  You sure  Try it  You'll like  Gimme  It's not open  Come on Iraq  Please  I find this hard to believe  Does anyone know anything  About French food  We're talking about food  So I figured  No  We went out with the Vosses  Last night  Rich and Bonnie  Oh the Vosses  And they took us to a very  Fancy French joint  Because Bonnie did some work 
[01:32:30]  So there was a bartering thing  Of course  Yes  This is the world  The Vosses live in  Bonnie wrote some jokes  Next thing you know  There's a barter  And they get to eat there for free  And they invited us  What restaurant  50  Was it Mario Batali  Or something  50  Where the fuck was I  51st between  6th and 7th  I forgot the name of the place  But it's supposedly  One of the best restaurants  In New York  And the food was  Outstanding  And it's a French restaurant  But the portions  Were so  Tiny  But I went home  So  Fucking full 
[01:33:00]  And my question today is  What the fuck is that about  I know which place you mean  Florentine used to talk about it  A French restaurant  Named Roy Roger's  Look at Jim  Roy Roger's  Roy Roger's  What's that about  Because the portions  Come out  And you're  You're kind of pissed off  Because it's so  So delicious  Yeah it's like that shit  That Travis has shown us  Is this the place  Oh yeah I guess it is  Let me see  Yeah I tweeted some of the pictures 
[01:33:30]  Of my meal  But that's pretty much  The stuff we were eating  They were tiny tiny portions  I went home  So fucking full  I felt like  I  I wanted to puke it up  I was uncomfortably full  Yeah  Yeah  I sat right there  That's a good song  I pinged Floyd  Uncomfortably full  Uncomfortably full  Wow  No one knows why  There is no pain  You are  My stomach swells  Just like a balloon  Are there any  It wasn't creamy 
[01:34:00]  Either by the way  Because that would be  The easy answer  So it's butter based  Or something  And that supposedly  Fills you up faster  I don't know  Yeah  By the way  Tiny portions  These are good  They taste like  What do they taste like  They're good  Little cookies  Animal crackers  Animal wafers  Animal crackers  But they almost blow  With the cupcake part  Right  They're very dry  Oh really  Yeah  I like these  Very much  Do you  I think  All right Edgar  One was on my  Do you Edgar 
[01:34:30]  Tooth  Yeah  From yesterday  Edgar  I got one stuck  To my teeth  I had to  Scrape it off  I'm Edgar  Anthony  Tasty but  Shut up  Not all that good  Shut your mouth  Shut your mouth  Shut up  Do your duty 
[01:35:00]  Right  Do your duty  You're good  You come from  Lower stock  That's what it is  Lower stock  Stock right  I'm like low stock  Now people ask  The question  What is the standard  That you would use  To measure mental illness  I don't know  That's true too  We're not doctors  We're just throwing  Questions out there  And I love when  They on Twitter  I don't know  On Twitter  It hasn't been proven  FBI profilers  They're all saying  The same thing  This is one of the reasons  They do it 
[01:35:30]  Is for the attention  It's not the only reason  But it's a big part of it  And I believe  When enough profilers  Are saying it  I just believe it  Because I see as many people  As they've captured  That they profiled accurately  I trust their judgment  More than somebody  With a vested interest  In the gun issue  Either way  I trust the profilers  Judgment  Well Piers and Larry Pratt  Continued  You're an unbelievably  Stupid man  Aren't you  Whoa  It seems to me  That you're morally obtuse  You seem to prefer  That's where 
[01:36:00]  You're being obtuse  Yeah  That's where Piers goes wrong  It's going to send him  In the hole for a while  You don't have to  Agree with what  Larry Pratt's saying  But he sounds like  He knows what he's talking about  As far as his side goes  He's not being stupid  He's giving you  He's giving you  At least a legitimate  The other side of the argument  Yeah  What say you  Fuzzy Bridges  Sorry  Modern  I just like the word  Obtuse  From Shawshank Redemption  When he told the warden  He was being obtuse  And he threw him  In the fucking hole  For a couple of weeks  What does obtuse mean? 
[01:36:30]  You're being unreasonable  Obtuse  Yeah  Not really  You're an unbelievably  Stupid man  Aren't you?  Oh  It seems to me  That you're morally obtuse  You seem to prefer  Being a victim  To being able to prevail  Over the criminal element  And I don't know  Why you want to be  The criminal's friend  Right  What a ridiculous argument  No  You have absolutely  No coherent argument  Whatsoever  What?  You don't actually  Give a damn deal  About the gun murder rate  In America  You don't actually care 
[01:37:00]  It seems to me  It seems to me  That facts don't bother you  Do they Mr. Morgan  You would like to see  Let's go through this  Facts don't seem  They bounce right off  Of your head  No no let's deal  With some facts  You're speaking oblivious  To what we do know  Is that when you go  To an area in the United States  Where guns are freely available  Readily able to be carried  Legally  There you find  Our lowest murder rates  Lower than the murder rates  In Europe  You go to our cities  Where we have cracked down  On guns  And people can't  Defend themselves  And that's where 
[01:37:30]  The criminals  Have a feel  How many guns  Did Mrs. Lanza  Have in her home  Oh  I don't know  How many she had  And that really  Is not the point  The point is  Somebody with evil  In his  She had six guns  Including four  Assault rifles  And what happened was  Her deranged son  Who clearly was  Very disturbed  Her evil son  Her evil son  It doesn't matter  What you call him  We shouldn't be  Well I think it matters  Because if you believe  And understand  That there is evil  In the world  Then you don't  Try as your first line 
[01:38:00]  Of defense  To solve it  Psychiatrically  You protect yourself  With a gun  There you go  You know what  That guy  Is making a very  Pierce is doing  A terrible job  Defending himself there  You're stupid  That makes no sense  He's trying to  Fucking like  Write it off  The guy was making  A valid argument  An outside observer  That guy  I understood  That guy's point  I would love to  Well the guy's staying  On point  On point  Yes  And Pierce  Has his emotions  Getting in the way 
[01:38:30]  I've been pwned  Like if Pierce  Said something about  That woman had  Legal guns in her house  Like that's a valid  Rebuttal  So then you make  This guy rebut the fact  Okay legal guns here  And this is what happened  Right  But Pierce didn't do that  But Pierce didn't do that  He's just throwing that  In his side  While he's calling  The guy stupid  And the guy's  Clearly not being stupid  It continues  Let me finish my thread  There Mr. Pratt  So you have an evil  Young man  Who is living at home  Clearly with serious  Troubles  And his mother  Has six firearms  In that house 
[01:39:00]  Including the weapons  That he used  To murder  26 people  Including 20 children  Aged five  You are quite happy  About that situation  Are you  And you would be  Quite happy  If there are  Many more people  In his position  In homes  Around America  Where there are  That number of firearms  Which could be used  By mentally unstable people  Americans with firearms  In their homes  Typically have them  Locked in a safe  As I do  And as most gun owners 
[01:39:30]  Certainly do  The fact that  This woman did not  And knew that her son  Was unstable  Reflected poorly  On her judgment  And unhappily  She paid very dearly  For her poor judgment  But that's not the reason  That you should be able  To come down  On everybody else  Who's a law abiding gun owner  Who uses good sense  And to say  We've got to pay  For that person's  Stupidity  For their  Shortcomings  That's just not 
[01:40:00]  Going to wash  We're not going  To let it happen  This guy made  He smashed  He destroyed him  Yes  So how do we  Take care of  The irresponsible  Gun owners  Unfortunately  Very difficult  Thing to do  You know  Were you doing  An Apple 5  Impression right there  Apple 5  Unfortunately  Gun control  I don't know  Assault rifle  See the thing is  The way Pierce 
[01:40:30]  Is speaking  You mean the hothead  Yes the hothead  You'd assume  That every house  That has guns in it  Is an irresponsible person  With a lunatic  Living in the house  That can just  Pick up the gun  And start shooting people  The truth of the matter  The truth of the matter is  Many many more people  Are saved  By firearms  Legal firearms  In their own homes  Many more people  Are saved  By them  So  You will get 
[01:41:00]  These instances  Where  Crazy bad people  Will do bad things  With guns  Just like they will  With cars  And knives  Or anything else  I will never  Say that guns  Aren't the most  Efficient way  To kill  A lot of people  It is  And  But that's  That's the world  We live in  Why can't people  Grasp that  You know  You know what the problem  With the argument  Anti-gun argument  Is  Is like you said  We've already  So far gone 
[01:41:30]  They're acting like  Here's the choice  Armed citizens  To protect themselves  And the other choice  Is all guns disappear  Right  Now honestly  If I could have that choice  I would take  All guns disappear  And then go with  England's murder rate  I would literally  Be willing  To forego  The second amendment  If  By doing so  All guns disappeared  And  Very  Very  Very  Few  Criminals  Had them  And very  Very  Few  Gang  Murders  But that's 
[01:42:00]  Not where we are  It's not like  There's a magic  Door that you open  And one is  You walk through  With no second amendment  And all guns are gone  And the other  Is all  It's like an  Unbalanced argument  Because  To say  All citizens  Arm themselves  Or can legally  Arm themselves  The other side  Of the argument  Is  Or  We are pretty much  Where we are  Right now  With a lot of  Criminals having guns  And us not having  You know what I mean  It's not like  You can wipe them  All out  And that's where  These anti-gun guys  Go wrong 
[01:42:30]  With their argument  Who is for  What percentage  Of America  Is for  Gun control  Do you know that  Anthony  What  Of course  It's pretty much  Split down the middle  That's our country  At work  Of course that is  News organizations  Will spin it  And say  The majority  Of Americans  Are in favor  Of gun control  But  That's a crazy  Stat too  Because gun control  Can be anything  From eliminate  All guns in this country  To  We want people  To have background 
[01:43:00]  Checks  That's gun control  And by the way  That number  Absolutely changed  Over the weekend  Because the gun sales  Were way the fuck up  Way the fuck up  There's 300 million guns  In this country  Jesus  You mean to tell me  Are there really  Yeah  So that's one for every person  Just about  Yeah  So what the fuck  So you mean to tell me  54%  It makes it sound like  They make it sound like  54% of this country  Want guns gone  No  They want some controls  On the distribution 
[01:43:30]  Of guns  So if we have  Over 300 million guns  In America  Where does that  Match up with other countries  Who's number two  It's fucking crazy  We're way  Way above everybody else  We're pretty far ahead  Of everybody  As far as our gun ownership goes  I like making my points  Over and over again  But we  We went down this fucking road  Way back in the 1700s  With the second amendment  300 million guns  That's really tough  To fucking  Pull back down  And I don't have any  But when you think of  It's I think  88 out of every 100 people 
[01:44:00]  Have guns  How many  88 out of every 100 people  No  That's 88% of the people  That's  That's completely right  That couldn't be right  No way  I think that that's  Or it could be a stat  Like  Yeah that seems a lot  Not 88% of the people  But the number of guns  Per people  It's 88  Out of 100  But many people  Own multiple guns  So  Yeah that could  Because dude  I only know  A couple of people  With guns  Like yourself  And you know  A few cops I know 
[01:44:30]  I guess you have to  Count cops  But I think that stat  Is way off  What's up  You're right  At the end of 2010  It was estimated  That 45% of Americans  Own guns  If you took the percentage  Of guns  To the number of Americans  That number rises to 90%  That means if you kind of  Did it one gun per person  One gun per person  So Anthony has  Kind of New Jersey covered  Yes  Larry Pratt  And Piers Morgan  Continue  Oh they do  They get real heated here  I'm sure you're not  Going to try and let it happen  You see my argument  Is not about the Americans  Right to defend themselves 
[01:45:00]  In their home  With a firearm  That's not the argument  That I'm trying to put out there  My argument is the same  As the argument  That Senator Feinstein  Said  That the president endorses  That I believe  Many many Americans  Now believe  Following this tragedy  Which is that  There is absolutely  No use  And no justification  For these  AR-15 type  Assault weapons  Oh on the contrary  How can you say  Such a thing  The Korean merchants  In Los Angeles  Use these kinds of firearms  To protect their lives  And their businesses 
[01:45:30]  And for you to say  There's no useful purpose  For these guns  That's just completely wrong  Okay  Let me finish my sentence  There are these assault weapons  Which have been used now  In movie theatres  In shopping malls  In elementary schools  To murder  Many many Americans  And now 25 year old children  And they are armed with magazines  30 at a time here  100 in Aurora  In a movie theatre  And your only answer  Mr Pratt 
[01:46:00]  To people that want to get rid  Of both the magazines  And these assault weapons  If I'm not mistaken  Is to let everybody else  Have similar weapons  Is that the solution  To America's gun murder problem  I would challenge you  To go and tell  The Korean merchants  Who survived the riots  In Los Angeles  Sorry you had those firearms  Can you answer my question  Because it saved your lives  I'm answering your question  I wish you could understand it  Because you're talking  Against self-defense  Would you like to see  Would you like to see  People being able 
[01:46:30]  Would you like to see  Teachers armed with  And you don't want to hear it  That's why you keep interrupting  No no I don't mind hearing it  I think it's complete nonsense  But I don't mind hearing it  You would like to see  Brits tend to do that  Don't they  Stop being so facetious  That's what he said  Facetious  I agreed with Piers  On that last point  Facetious  On that last point  I agreed with Piers  Here's another thing  About these assault weapons  That they call them  And what  Or a pepper weapons  Here's another thing  Double guns 
[01:47:00]  Oops  The gist  The whole fucking gist  Of the second amendment  Is put in place  For the American people  To keep the government in check  Now a lot of people argue  That this is a dated concept  Because of the strength  And weaponry  Of the government these days  But that is  It's not just self-defense  And it's not just hunting  The whole fucking framework  Of the second amendment  Is that the American people 
[01:47:30]  Have the ability  To rebel against their government  If the government becomes  Too uppity  As they say  AR-15s  Semi-automatic  Assault weapons  Are the answer  To that  And for people that say  The American military  Is so strong  That it's retarded  Look at Afghanistan  We're talking about  The American military  Going in  And a number  Of the people  They are fighting  With a horrid result  Are just people  With AK-47s 
[01:48:00]  And a few random  Explosives  But the truth of the matter is  An armed citizenry  Is armed  To protect against  A tyrannical government  Can you see Americans  We're obese  Can you see Americans  Rebelling with guns  Against the government  I understand  I can't see that anymore  You're right  But I can't see it anymore  I understand  But you still can't say  Just because  There's fat people around  That he can't run 
[01:48:30]  The board for us  Go ahead  Say something hurtful  About me again  We already got one  On the HR sheet  You can't say  Just because  America's out of shape  Yeah  That  Their right  To defend themselves  Against  A tyrannical government  Which of course  Not right now  I'm not talking about  But no one knows  What the future's  Going to hold  No one knows  If another entity  From outside our borders  Will attack us  In a way that  The American people 
[01:49:00]  Will have to stand up  And fight for their  Own freedoms and rights  And to do that  With pistols  And nothing else  Because the government  Says that  That's all you can use  Is against everything  The Second Amendment  Was written about  Then I think that  If that's true  Yes  Then I think  The Second Amendment  Is one of those things  If what you're saying  Is true  It needs to be looked at  In the time  It was written in  And realize that  Our interests now  In some ways  Are the same  But in a lot of ways  Are different  And it's just  One of those things  Like slavery 
[01:49:30]  Like women not having rights  Like all these  Ideas in this country  That have over time  Evolved and changed  We're not going to get  To that point anytime soon  No  I don't know  It just sounds like  We're  I'm all for people  Have pistols  I don't mind that  Because I think  If we're at a point  Where you literally  Need a machine gun  To defend yourself  From government intrusion  We're in really deep trouble  Well yeah  Like I can't  Because by the way 
[01:50:00]  If you're  If you  If the threat  To us as a people  Is so forceful  And violent  That we cannot defend it  With just handguns  Or shotguns  Like literally  If every citizen  Needs  Some type of a  Fucking 50 round  Firing weapon  Then the assault  On us  Will not be  Room to room  It will  If the assault  Is violent enough  That we require  That to defend ourselves  Then the assault  Is going to be  With tanks  Or it's going to be  With predator drones 
[01:50:30]  Or the government  Is not going to come  House to house  In this day and age  With a violent enough  Assault  For us to require  That  Do you know  What I'm saying  Like  If it's at that point  When we need that  To defend ourselves  The government  Is using predator drones  I'm not talking  About using it  It's also  Something called  The balance of power  Detente  The reason  The government  Is kept in check  Is because  Of that armed public  Well I don't go  For detente  Because I think  It's incest  Detente 
[01:51:00]  Jesus  It's there  It's there  To keep the government  In check  And regardless  Of what  What type  Of weaponry  The government  Has  No government  Wants  Well the American  No government  That's in charge  Of America  Wants to roll  Over their citizens  With tanks  Or blow up cities  With predator drones  Obviously  But the thing  That keeps them  From just  Using legislation  Or going  House to house 
[01:51:30]  Is the fact  That the citizenry  Is armed  So you're  Taking it to the extreme  On the other end  Well if something happens  Tanks will roll over  The houses  And they kill everybody  And that's what happens  And your guns  Will be useless  But take the guns away  And now the people  Are just at the will  Of the government  To use a pen  To fuck us  But I think  We are always  We are never going  To respond  With guns  To the pen  Never  I know  But the reason  Is because  They're there  It's a deterrent  It's a deterrent  From the government 
[01:52:00]  Taking  Grabbing  Unreasonable power  For themselves  Which they have  Anyway by the way  I was going to say  We're already at that point  And we're not doing  Anything about it  We don't do anything  About it  We do nothing  And I don't think  By the way  That they  I think you're right  I mean what is it going  To take where we do  You know  Act out against our government  The government doesn't want  If we haven't yet  The government doesn't want  To roll over  Taxes go up again  January 1st  And what is it going to take  Yeah  We all have our guns  They know if they 
[01:52:30]  Roll over people with tanks  Or use predator drones  That our country's gone  It's done  Right  But the only way  They would need to do that  Is if they wanted to  Grab power from the people  Now they could do it  With a pen  But if the fear  If they were unarmed  If guns were really  A deterrent  And the idea that  An armed population  Then  The way the banks  Fuck us  Would never happen  The way  The  Companies  Fuck us 
[01:53:00]  Would never  Ever happen  They have  Zero concern  That an armed population  Is going to strike back  Because you look at the way  They treat us now  It's not as bad  As it could be  But look at the way  They raise taxes  Or the death tax  Right  Or look at the way  That these companies  Will pay each other  So much money  And fuck the employee  They have zero fear  I think they need  To have that fear  They don't have it  I think people need  To drag CEOs out  And beat them to death  In the middle of the street  To put that fear in them 
[01:53:30]  Because they do not have it  For all the guns  300 million guns  And nobody in power  Is afraid of being murdered  Other than a random shooting  Exactly  But that's the situation  We put ourselves in  But if you  If you look ahead  You can't look right now  Obviously  Even with Obama  In office  Where people think  You know  He's power grabbing  And everything  If you can look ahead  To the future  And think  That there might be  At some point  A very unstable  Tyrannical person  In office 
[01:54:00]  300 million guns  Turning  The potential  Of 300 million guns  Turning on you  Would be a deterrent  To a complete power grab  But I think  That the crisis  We live in now  Yeah  In some ways  Overrides that potential threat  Only because  I would 100% be with you  If people did the right thing  With their guns  And I won't mention  Any institution  But if people began  Dragging executives  Out of certain businesses  And putting bullets 
[01:54:30]  In their heads  For interest rates  I would be 100% with you  If all of a sudden  They said  Fucking 30 bank executives  Were executed  By citizens  Tired of getting  0.1  I would go  Wow this country  Is fucking great  And fuck every liberal  Who hates guns  When we went through  The banking crisis  A lot of lives  Were destroyed  And that  And nothing happened  How many of them  Were murdered  How many of these guys  Were shot  They ended up getting  Their bonuses  They got their bonuses  They still got their  Fucking bonuses  You're right  The whole thing's a joke  The fear of someone  On the button 
[01:55:00]  With a nuke  Outweighs 300 million guns  Exactly  But my point is  No one's going to  Nuke the country  Because then there  Wouldn't be a country  How did somebody  Send you that  Fucking that feedback  From 1988  Yeah exactly  Man no nukes man  Hey look man  We're backing up here  We got David Tell  Outside the studio  Oh is he here  And we have one more  Clip to play  From Larry Pratt  On Piers Morgan  Last night  This is how it  Wrapped up  I just want you to  Answer this one question  Post what happened  At Sandy Hook  Your answer  To this problem 
[01:55:30]  Of repeated use  Of this weapon  With these high  Capacity magazines  Is to continue  Letting Americans  Buy them  With impunity  And to not  Concern yourself  With these mass  Shootings  Is that right?  The second amendment  Means what it says  And meanwhile  You want to continue  Laws against  Self-defense  Laws that prohibit  Self-defense  Laws that prohibit  Teachers and other  Faculty, other members  Of the administration 
[01:56:00]  And schools  From being able  To defend themselves  If they have a  Concealed carry permit  The laws prohibit  Them right now  We have been  Lobbying against  Those laws  Since they were put on  We will continue  To do so  Pointing out  That that is where  The problem is  And for you  To support them  Means that  You're really blind  To the role  That that plays  In enabling  Murderers to  Operate with impunity  Wow  I thought he was  A little evasive  In that answer  Like I know  What he said 
[01:56:30]  He was evasive  Well it's a loaded  Fucking  That's true  Loaded question  From peers  Because he's asking  It in a way  That says  If you support  What you've been  Talking about here  You support  Killing children  It's  And a lot of  The anti-gun people  Have been presenting  Their questions  And statements  In that fashion  That's not the choice  And people don't want  Guns to give  Someone the right  To kill people  And kill children  Who go into schools  They want their gun rights  To protect themselves 
[01:57:00]  And protect people  That might be  In harm's way  Of a murderer  Like this  It amazes me  It fucking amazes me  Peers  Alright with that  We should go  To break  Because we got  David Tell coming in  And we got Judd Apatow  In about an hour  Stay there  This is  The Opie and Anthony  On Sirius XM  Are you looking for  The perfect holiday gifts  For your family?

[02:02:00]  For a person who was involved in the comedy community  Linda Cork  Who was really influential in a lot of comics careers  Chris Rock, myself  Jimmy played for her at our other clubs  But she used to run with her dad  This place called Jimmy's Comedy Alley in Queens  And it was a lot of places where we all started  To like headline and everything like that  And like Adam Sandler played there  Like a lot of people who are now super huge  And she was just always so cool to the comics  Such a great lady  And she passed away 
[02:02:30]  And you know  It was very difficult to like  You know with all the funeral  All that stuff going on in Connecticut  To this  And you know  It's like you almost felt like  You know like weird  Like you were cheating on the sadness  You know what I'm saying  Oh fuck  And it was horrible  So you know  To Jimmy  To Linda's family  You know  Paulie and all those people  You know  I just wanted to say  You know  Thanks for putting that memorial together  And it took a lot of work  And even the priest brought up the other thing  Which I thought was like  You know  Hey dude 
[02:03:00]  You know  Jeez  Pick a team  You know what I'm saying  Oh fuck  It's like being on a date  And talking about your ex  Yeah  It was really inappropriate  But uh  Holy shit  Yeah  How do I feel about gun control?  Or anything that is associated with this  I guess  Oh I don't know  Well  I don't know  What's your thoughts I guess  Well  If you don't want to  People want  This is a horrible situation  My uh  I have a lot of family friends  Who are teachers  And they're heroes  And uh  You know  They work in Connecticut  And the lockdown  That they had to go through that day  And all that kind of stuff  It really does show you 
[02:03:30]  One thing that like  Anybody who wants to take away benefits  Or like  Think your kids are not  Learning or whatever  These people are really amazing  When they're the final line of defense  Against a lunatic like that  So you know  And they actually tried to tackle the guy  They went after him physically  Yeah  That was like  Beyond courage  You know  That's zero dark 30  Kind of stuff  You know  They were out there  Doing it  But uh  For gun control  I know there's voices in the room  That are pro and con  But uh  You know  Somebody brought it up  That the bullets  I think it's something with the bullets 
[02:04:00]  You know  We should you know  Not have the ones that  Explode inside of you  I think that's a good thing  And I don't know  If we need assault rifles  I don't know  We need that  But I uh  You know  Like I say  The lance  The bow  The shield  The battle axe  I think this is great  A great time for them  To re-emerge  You know  The renaissance  Yeah  The renaissance weapon  Weaponry  Of days of old  I don't know man  Uh  All I'm gonna say is  Uh  You know  The kid  Uh  Don't blame it on video games  You know  I blame it on 
[02:04:30]  Um  You know  Jews  Uh  The Illuminati  Whatever  He had posters  He lived in the basement  We all  We've all lived in a basement  At some point  Of course  What are they calling it now  The dungeon of  Dungeon of evil  Oh the den of doom  Den of doom  Yeah  Where he played his video games  We all have the den of doom  The realtor takes you  Through the house  If you're a gamer  This is the den of doom  This is where um  Your child spends a lot of time  You play video games  Yeah that's gonna be a hard  In the dark part of the house  Yeah yeah  No kidding  It's gonna be hard  Den of doom 
[02:05:00]  But I guess uh  What we're all trying to think of  Is just get a rope  Long enough to go to hell  To fight him to the death  Yes  Again  Yes  Cage match in hell  Something yeah  Some kind of elevator to hell  But uh  You know  It's horrible  So you know  As a comic  Of course  Somebody's gonna say something  On stage  And it's gonna get  You know  Whatever  Right  Yeah  I started talking about it  Last time  You did  Yeah  You just gotta be careful  It's really careful  Were you like  Talking about the mother  And stuff  No I concentrated  Mostly on the media  And I smashed Dr. Phil  Dr. Phil  For going there  That vulture 
[02:05:30]  So stupid  You know  And then yeah  The mothers of course  Dr. Phil went to help though  With the camera crew  Yeah but the sympathy dogs  Beat him to it  Oh shit  And you know  Once they bring the sympathy dogs  Then they're really  Starting to run out of  Like you know  That was crazy  Because then it's the judgmental  Cats come in  Do people understand  What he's saying  No  It was a fluff piece  You don't know  It was a fluff piece  I saw it on CNN  Yeah there's a company  That brings in these dogs  To help with the grief  Yeah  Can you imagine  These dogs walking around  Newtown 
[02:06:00]  They're sympathetic  They're shitting all over  You're stepping in dog shit  I guess the studies have shown  If you're really sad  You know  You're less sad  If you start holding  And petting a dog  Oh yeah  So this company  Actually brings the dogs  Into these towns  That are suffering  What do they do  If somebody's killed  By a mauled by dogs  Oh my god  Right  They bring in dogs  You can hit them  The judgmental cats  Come in  Judgmental  Do you think the dogs  Would get a lot more credit  If they wore glasses  Because I was looking at them  The other day  And I was like  If they wore glasses  They would look like  Really kind 
[02:06:30]  Psychiatrist type  This steps on my company  Even keeled kangaroos  They play devil's advocate  Very well  Glass half full  Parrots  You got anything  On the comfort dogs  I see you got it  Up there on the street  Let me see  They sent 10 golden retrievers  I think it's a proven fact  That petting a dog  Relieves stress  I like the one  With the white face  Yes  He must handle the money  So they just sent 10 dogs  To help you around  I mean they're trying to help  I mean this is a gig  That's a gig for somebody 
[02:07:00]  I absolutely think it helps  Yeah but can you imagine  I think it helps  Yeah I've seen those guys  At the USO  And it does help  Imagine if there was  A fucking accident  And a truck hit them  And there was 10 dead dogs  Jesus  Oh my god  How much worse  That would make a town feel  A pile of dead dogs  That they're shipping up  With a shovel  Then we'd have to send  10 bulls  Yeah  10 live fucking happy  You'd have to pet them  As they're throwing their carcasses  Into the garbage truck  Oh my god  Try to shook a severed paw  Oh my god 
[02:07:30]  The fucking  It's the worst thing ever  First it was a murder  And then the truckload  Of happy dogs  Flipped over  And caught on fire  We could hear them  Yelping from inside  Oh that's awful  Which is dog for  Help me  There's a fire  But don't you think  That you know  With the media  I think you guys  Were talking about this  Which I totally agree  Is that like  It really is a slippery slope  Of the media  How close they get to this  To where it's like  Almost like  You know  Can I curse here  Yeah  Like get the fuck out of town 
[02:08:00]  Right  Get out  Let these people like  Have their moment  Supposedly the locals  Want them out  Oh yeah  How long are you going  To stay here  Well it's  You know  I wrote an article  Recently called  News or exploitation  With a question mark  Oh  That sounds good  You should be wearing glasses  Damn  That's pretty amazing  Yeah but I think  That like when they  You know  How many times  Do they interview  The mother  And the weird couple 
[02:08:30]  That mother and son  That run that bar  That's pretty weird  Whatever that is  The bar that  Is that where  Wolf brought everybody  That's one of the  No I don't know  Where he went  There's a story  Wolf's got some money  He probably took him  To the TGIF  Out on Route 32  I really don't know  The story  You told it  Just before you went  On air  But you gotta tell it  On air  Oh which one  The Wolf Blitzer  Oh well yeah  I don't have the details  I thought it was very nice  All the reporters  Are incredibly depressed  You know  As we all know  And you know  Especially the guy 
[02:09:00]  Who makes the montage  Of pictures  That guy must be like  Suicidal by now  Holy shit  I mean that is  The saddest thing  Ever  Right  But he took them  All out to eat  You know  On his CNN money  So who knows  Where that was  Boston Market  Or something  And one of the guys  Reported on the meal  Like you know  It was pretty good  And Wolf  Wolf took us out  So that shows you  Like they're out of story  You know  It's like  Yeah yeah yeah  They hit every angle  You know  If they're just talking  About going out  To dinner with Wolf  Yeah  It's time to just  Fucking go home

[02:10:00]  Can you at least  Just drop that  Like there's a couple  Little things you  Can at least do  Yeah  They find the saddest  Music to go in and  Out of their  Reports on CNN  Yeah this type of  Shit  Yeah this music  It's great  Like why do you  Need that as a  News organization  How about the music  That we always like  To play  The Benny Hill music  That would change  All coverage  It certainly would  We're back  With  From Newtown  Oh my god  That would be awful  Talking to the  Families  That's a mixed message  You think there 
[02:10:30]  Would be outrage  Oh my god  Holy shit  But it would be  More honest about  What the fucking  Press is doing  Right  It would be more  Honest about  What they do  It is a circus  Yeah  The Ropers  The Ropers theme  Wow  What are  This song can only  Be classified as  Retarded  No it's the theme  Song for my  Advice show  Today by the way  Is it  Oh it's today  Yes it is  Damn  This is  This is great  Well I have to ask  You have a special  Guest coming in  Can I say who it is 
[02:11:00]  Oh yeah yeah  Shut up  I'll have to ask him  About movie music  And like how  Like for the romance  The bromance  It's going to be  A certain type of  You know something  Like this side of  Dave Matthews  But not you know  Bruno  He probably has  Some kind of weird  I got your answer  I got your answer  What is it  Graham Parker  Oh there you go  Do you remember  Graham Parker  Well you'd have to  Play an example  For everyone to  I don't know  Graham Parker  I think he did  Cruel to be kind  Right  Yeah  Cruel to be kind  And then he had another hit  Is that him  I think  Graham Parker is featured  In this  This is 40 
[02:11:30]  Nick Lowe did  Nick Lowe did  Cruel to be kind  Play some Graham Parker  Nick Lowe  I can't remember  What Graham Parker sang then  I think he had two songs  They featured the one  That wasn't as popular  As the other one  I guess he couldn't get  Rice for the big song  What's Graham Parker's  Big song  You rock  Oh fuck  Wow I said  Cruel to be kind  Look him up  What are you doing in there  Fucking eating cookies  Hold back the night  Nah let me see  Sweet on you  I want  I know you're fine  Oh Ghostbusters 
[02:12:00]  Yeah it was Ghostbusters  Yep  Wow I don't know  What Graham Parker sang  No  He just won't play him  But he's the major  Storyline for this movie  But I don't know  What is a popular one  Why don't you just  Look it up  Travis look it up online  That's what I  Graham Parker's big song  On YouTube  Big man on paper  Would be the highest  Charting song  Play that then  Let's try it  I don't know what  He sounds like  Let's hear it  I know  What if it's a mystery  Or wake up  Next to you  In parenthesis  Either one  How about  Play one on YouTube  All right  Big man on paper 
[02:12:30]  He's not in the system  That's okay  Because I just  Thought of another  Gun thing  Okay good  Yeah so like  Everybody's talking  About their thing  On the guns  You know their theories  And like guns in movies  And this guy  Who like works at a deli  He goes  I don't get it  With America  Like where I'm from  Everyone has a machine gun  And yet this never happens  But we don't have TVs  So evidently  This man from Waziristan  Thinks we have a problem  He's like  We have guns  We just don't have schools  TVs 
[02:13:00]  Roads  Women with clitorises  Yeah we don't  We don't have any of the  I should  Yeah  Any of those temptations  Roads  Toilets  Nope  Never heard it  Get it off immediately  I don't like it  You kind of hate it  That Elvis Costello thing right  Yeah I didn't hate it  What the fuck is this song  Kevin from Connecticut  Where the fuck are you  I need your help today  You play with the band 
[02:13:30]  The Rumor right  Local Girls  Local Girls  That's the one  That's Kevin from Connecticut  Saying  Yeah that's definitely it  Let's have Local Girls  You know this one  There you go  You know this one  Didn't be able to tell  This is it  Every bromance  Debbie  Come back  That was just  We were just studying  Yeah but then  Debbie can't  Because she's being wielded  For a mastectomy  It's like a really weird twist  Then at the end 
[02:14:00]  They kiss at the prom  Surrounded by helper dogs  Where's the hook  Yeah  Oh you know this one  That's a good one  Yeah  But that seems like  That dates it  That seems like 80s  80s early  You know whatever  I don't know this  I think I know it  Well this isn't the song  You played in the movie  I remember this  Yeah  What year was this  I don't know it  Late 70s 
[02:14:30]  No  No this is  Later  It sounds 80s  83  I think it's 83  I'm going to say  I just guessed  Somewhere between  Bill Murray's  82  Stop prices writing me  On my dates  79  79  Wow  That's a great year  For the win  For the win  79  For the win  I wonder if  Jell was just a fan  And wanted to use him  In something  Yeah  But they didn't even  Use that song 
[02:15:00]  I don't  I might be wrong  I don't think so  Hey  We just showed  The video of the  Baby being picked up  By the golden eagle  Yeah  Everyone will see  This video  In the next couple days  That's fucked up  Yo  This fucking golden eagle  Put it on our  Facebook page  Opie and Anthony  Actually gets the kid  Up in the air  They go slow motion  So  You must have thought  He was a funny rabbit  Or something  Some park somewhere  Little eagle comes down  Around  Swooping in  Oh shit  Grabs the kid  And he gets him 
[02:15:30]  Off the ground  He's coming to grass  Well he's running  Toward his kid  Wait they're speaking  Like some weird language  Yes  That isn't  American  It's bird language  Oh no  There's a kid  It's okay  And then they have to  Jazz up the video  But here  Here it is  In slow motion  Oh man  It gets the kid  Up in the air though  Look  Goes about 10  Maybe 10 feet  And then drops him  From about 5-6 feet 
[02:16:00]  Off the ground  That kid will never  Stop eating chicken  He'll never stop  That's fucked up  Shit right there  That kid's gonna  Hate birds forever  Oh my god  He looks like  The bird hater  Yeah  We gotta ban  Golden eagles  Obviously  What a great story  Cute  Cute animal story  Yeah  Are you afraid of flying  Well when I was a child  I was almost abducted  But wouldn't that be good  If they abducted him  And raised him  To their eagle world  On the side of the cliff somewhere 
[02:16:30]  Yeah  Regurgitating food in his mouth  What age would you run out of room  On the side of the cliff  And he'd have to  Regurg  Yeah  Oh that would be the best  It would last right up  Until they try to push him  Out of the nest  To make him fly  Yeah  Let's get a treatment together  That could be a good movie  And he has great eyesight  Because eagles do right  Yes  I mean he got him  Except he confused him  For a rabbit  When he goes in a restaurant  He can't sit at the table  He has  You have to put a crumb for him  And he has to run from across the room  And snatch it up and eat it  And did you see how the father  Whoever ran to it 
[02:17:00]  Was like slowly like  Oh  Oh I better stop this  But he knew it was a great  Video moment  Yes  So you know  Yes  He was torn  That's a hard  That's a weird attack  I wonder if that like happens  And it doesn't turn out nice  I don't know  Where you know  The eagle just flies off  With some fucking kid  And they actually said  That with the reason  That they have  They said that this is a problem  Because the kid had worms  In his hood  Well  But also the  The eagle had  The eagle had Asperger's  So he  Yes 
[02:17:30]  They didn't know  What to do with him  Yeah  The kid was a little  Chubby little  Little fellow  So I think  That saved his life  But he was sitting there  Like he kind of wanted it  It was how he was dressed  I was just sitting here  He was wearing a little animal hat  That had eyes on it  Yeah  Did he really?  Yeah  His hat had little eyes on it  Like a fucking animal  Oh  Did I see that?  I bet the eagle fucking  Well I bet you that's what it was  Came down on him  If he was wearing a Philadelphia Eagles hat  That would have been  Yeah  Oh man 
[02:18:00]  That would have fucking been cool  The father set him up  Yeah the father  He had a thing on his hat  That said  Oh wow  Delicious eagle food here  Got two giant eyes  On the top of his winter hat  Eyes and ears  On his little thing  Ears too  That's what it is  Poor little guy  Harry at PA  He says you gotta google  Golden eagles killing wolves  It's amazing  Oh cool  Can you find just one of those videos  They should be scary  Is this the new Hobbit movie?  What is it?  Giant eagles attacking little people? 
[02:18:30]  We saw the Hobbit  David  How was it?  I liked it  And I liked the new technology  Is it really?  How long has it been since the last Hobbit?  It was the first Hobbit  First one was 10 years ago  Wow  It was Lord of the Rings  Lord of the Rings  Backwards  Yeah that was 10 years ago  Which is fun  Pretty soon we'll just have one of J.R.R. Tolkien  Just yelling at his son  Or something  Three-parter  Leave me alone  I'm writing  You think this is the best  It's the best  Golden eagle killing wolves  For you?  Oh me  I'm into this 
[02:19:00]  Alright we got the wolf  Badass dude  Looks like a coyote  That is not a rescue dog  What the fuck is that guy holding him?  Wow  Like a Sherpa  Oh boy  They've decided to let the golden eagle have its way  Eagle versus wolf  Two of them  Damn  Alright  They released the golden eagles  There's two of them flying  Yeah  They've actually been trained  They have the strings on them  Oh boy  He knows  He knows  Is that a baby wolf? 
[02:19:30]  This is like in some kind of  Mongolia  They only have those kind of  Mongolia  They only have those horses like in that area  The Genghis Khan horses  Genghis Khan  You never see those  At a party  You never ride one of those  It could be Burma  Wow  You might know it is  Look at this man  Does eagle get winged in his eyes?  Holy  Wow  Oh fuck that  Pulls it right down to the ground  See  Can't you kick the shit out of that eagle  You fucking pussy  I just fucking grab it  Wow 
[02:20:00]  See we don't need guns  We need eagles  Oh my god  That flips the wolf right over  We need eagle control  The wolf doesn't have hands  Let me come over on my weird horse  I'll be right down  I'll be right down on my dog horse  Mongolia  It's a strange horse  It has tiny little legs  Yeah  It's like a  Genghis Khan horse  It's like really  The wolf's okay  They were actually just tickling it  Oh  Oh gee  And then the eagle comes right back to the guy 
[02:20:30]  That's a hell of a weapon right there  That's a big fucking bird man  That thing's gotta be heavy on his arm  How much do they weigh you think?  Fucking 300 pounds  I thought it'd be a lot heavy  I'll play my part  What are they doing with the wolf?  Are you gonna eat him?  Yeah  And I like that very serious voiceover  The Jeremy Irons of  Sure  Of Ukrania  Of Upper Mongolia  It's no honey badger  You know what's funny?  It's like this is the other thing to do there  You know  It's like  What do you want to do? 
[02:21:00]  Milk a goat?  Or this  Oh wow  There's a bunch of them  Wow  Like got an eagle brigade  Yeah it's a fucking eagle farm  That's how they haunt  That's where they take their pictures for money  Wow  Not a tree  Not a tree to be seen  Wow that's fucked up right there  It's amazing  I'll bet you they have the highest incidence per capita of hat thefts  That's great  Yes  So it's an epidemic in Mongolia  Yes  People having their wool hats pulled off 
[02:21:30]  Don't get fucking  Don't get eyes on your kid's hat then  Get something eagle's hate  Like a fucking  Like a little  Get fire on his hat  Yes they don't like fire  They don't like fire  A chainsaw  Yeah a chainsaw  Or a gun  Their habitat  Yeah  We have to bring up something else too  Let's go  Remember Gus and Elmer?  Yeah  Do we have the actual story?  The old gay couple  Maybe  Either Gus or Elmer  Is no longer with us  No  No  The longest gay couple  Wow 
[02:22:00]  First Daniel  We did hours on Gus and Elmer  We love Gus and Elmer  Oh how tragic  But I guess one of them's gone  Wow  Is it true?  It was a glory hole mishap  They held out for marriage  Dave  They never got married?  They waited 60 years  To get married  There's Gus and Elmer  We love these guys  Gus and Elmer  Oh wow  Oh  I hope it's not the one wearing the bolo  Yeah  What's the story?  Do we have the news story?  Poor Gus and Elmer 
[02:22:30]  I hope I got my info right  Gus  Oh Gus  Which one's Gus?  96  Bad news Dave  Which one?

[02:23:00]  For like three days  I know  Gotta switch it up  I don't want an eagle  To pull me out of that  Evac  Pull your head out of the lap  You pop smoke  And the eagle comes down  Oh what a shame  Yeah we talked about them  Sure  You know they were  Gay lovers in a time  Where you know  That wasn't really  Yeah that was really cool  Remember everything  We did on them?  They were old  Yeah  They started out as just  You know  Roommates  Roomies  Roomies  And maybe war buddies  Yeah they both probably met  Like on Omaha Beach  Or something  Yeah yeah yeah  And then we talked about 
[02:23:30]  How they got home  And the news must have  Covered it like  Yeah they're single  And available ladies  Yes  Two very eligible bachelors  They spend all their time together  So ladies  You might want to  Hook up with a friend of yours  Because you're going to be  Spending a lot of time  With these two  They go everywhere together  Pals is what I call them 
[02:24:00]  So why didn't they get married?  I don't get it  Isn't it allowed now?  Well  Did they ever get married?

Well Jimmy likes his yogurt fat free  Yeah Jim you look excellent man  You've lost some weight since the last gig  Yeah I've been working on it Dave  Yeah what's your  What's the scene?  Oh no don't ask  Well I tell you  Yesterday was a kettlebell day  Cattlebells are great  Yeah I know  And I have to 
[02:25:30]  Very briefly  In the locker room  You ever see that  There's a black guy in our locker room  He's always there  He's in tremendous  He looks like he's strong as a bull  He looks like he's about 45  He looks like an old school strong man  Yeah  I know what you're talking about  He's like Haitian or something  Yeah yeah  And he was doing kettlebells  He was watching me do them  So he comes up and he goes  He goes  Give me your wallet  Yeah  He said  He goes  Where did you learn to do kettlebells?  And I was like  Well I've been watching this guy  On  Online 
[02:26:00]  And he goes  Can I see the video?  And I'm like  I'm dreading it  Because I know when he asks me  He's not going to go  Well could you teach me to do kettlebells?  Oh yeah  So we watched the video  For about a minute  In the locker room  He goes  He doesn't know what he's doing  And I'm like really?  And he goes  Yeah I was watching you  You're going to hurt yourself  Oh no  Yeah you can  And he told me that  He showed me videos  He's a trainer  But he showed me videos  Of guys who are really good  And he goes  Do it like these guys do  Because you're going to hurt yourself  The way you're moving 
[02:26:30]  What were you doing?  It was something about  My movements  Just weren't right  But then he watched the video  And he realized  I was doing it like the video  Were you throwing it up in the air  And having it land on your head?  Yes  What I was doing with the kettlebells  You're going to hurt yourself  Is I was skipping around the gym  Carrying like  Like little little kettles  And I would mime  Pouring tea for everyone  And then I would ring them  Like bells against my face  You could hurt yourself  I thought they were called kettleballs  So I would swing them  And allow them to mash  Into my testicles  With my back against a wall  And he goes 
[02:27:00]  You're going to hurt yourself  And I'm like  Thank you guy  From Serpent and the Rainbow  Dr. Allen  I dreamt about kettlebells  You were in it  That's very good  That he told you that  But I have to look up  These other guys now  Yeah  But I think they were still  Helping me get strong  But I've been having  Oh shit  No I know a guy for you man  Do you?  Yeah no really  This guy Steve  Coach Fury  He does the kettlebells  He's great  It's all about like  Honestly  He's really good  Is there a video online?  Because I hate having a trainer  He's super strong  Why do you hate having a trainer?  I just don't want to commit to it 
[02:27:30]  It annoys me  I like doing it at my own pace  Like yesterday  I do my kettlebells  And my fucking pull ups  If I didn't have a trainer  If I didn't have a trainer  I wouldn't work out  If I did  I would resent it  And bail out  Yeah  Steve Coach Fury  He's great  Man  You're the same right?  You like to just kind of  Go in and do your own thing  I would never fucking work out  Steve Cotter  Oh yeah  That's one of the guys  He recommended to me  Oh man  Steve Cotter  My guy's really good  No I go to a trainer  Once in a while  Learn some new shit  And then I do it on my own  That's not the guy  I'm talking about  He told me Steve Cotter  Plus our gym has shitty trainers  Do they?  Yeah they just talk to their clients 
[02:28:00]  The whole time  And they allow them  To carry their pocketbooks around  It just bothers me  There was Steve Cotter  He recommended  The American Kettlebell Club  And this guy Parvell or something  He said those are the three videos to watch  So I'm going to relearn kettlebells  Watch me do one the way he said  And just paralyze myself  Well  We've got to get ready  For the Judd Apatow interview  The big interview is coming up  That's right  Dave is staying  What kind of  Yes  Do you mind? 
[02:28:30]  Because I was in one of his movies  Yes you were  Yeah funny people  Yes  Question mark  That's what I call it  Will he remember you David?  I have heard  I hope so  That's my guy  Man look at that  That's your guy  You should go with Steve man  He's great  He's too strong  No dude  He's excellent  He's too tall  I do that  He  No  Doesn't it hurt your wrist?  That's really hard to do  I could do that  That's really hard to do  That's pretty hard  Yeah  No really  That's a clean jerk  I forget what he 
[02:29:00]  I'm not a really good student  I don't assault him  How do they figure out  That kettlebells are a good workout?  He lifts like the whole person  With one arm  It's amazing  But how do they figure out  This is a good workout?  This is like a Russian prison workout dude  This is like hardcore  It looks like  There's people's heads  It would be murder on your wrist  They just grab their hair  On their fucking severed heads  I cannot say he's the best  He works really well with people like us  Who are really old  And like you know  This is you know  Fair enough  This is horrible  I like the kettlebell  But I'm saying it again  Steve coached her  I do too 
[02:29:30]  I like when it's kettlebell day  What I do is  I set up two kettlebells  And I figure eight  Run between them quickly  To what music?  Put back on the  Graham Parker  No no no  I put on  What's the big one?  From Flashdance  Yes  She's a maniac  Maniac  My head is going  And I have my  Olivia Newton-John headband on  It will cut you like goodness  You got a little sweat here  And down there  Yes  Exactly  My cunt  Jesus  Your beautiful wet camel toe  Thinking a phone call

[02:34:30]  And I could see that the game  Was going to last a really long time  Hours  And so I just went to the judge guy  And I go  I gotta go eat lunch  And I left  Which I don't think  A little commitment  Yes  Your film comes out Friday  And uh  I saw it  Yes  I liked it  I'm very phlegmy right now  Oh, it's too early  It's the morning phlegm  That one scene we were talking about  It's like  Are you concerned when you  Have a film come out  Like they cancelled the premiere  Of Tom Cruise's movie 
[02:35:00]  Right, yes  Well, can I explain  Because I saw it  Are you going to have problems  With the Albert Brooks  Uh, hose  Uh, kiddie pool scene  Well, this kind of stuff  Happens all the time  There's a scene in the movie  You know, Albert Brooks  Has, uh  Has triplets  And so  He's broke  And he says  You know, I'm going to have to  What do you want me to do  Because I can't afford him  He's yelling at his son  What do you want me to do  You know, get rid of two of them  Let's go play  Let's go play murder  We'll pick the best one  And so  You know, you shoot  So yeah, so you shoot it 
[02:35:30]  You know, a year and a half ago  Right  Anything could land on the week  When something devastating happens  Of course  I remember when Stiller did  Zoolander  It was just filled with shots  Of the World Trade Center  Oh, right  But he had a month  You know, there was a few weeks  Before the movie came out  So he went and he digitally  Made adjustments  Spider-Man 2, I think  Had that  A shot of the Trade Center  They had to take it out  But if you think deeply  About almost any piece  Of entertainment  You can get to  An interpretation  Of any joke  Right 
[02:36:00]  Because I did a bunch  Of talk shows this week  And I'd be going through  Like my jokes  With the segment producer  And they were like  Oh, no, you can't talk about that  Because that kind of seems  Like it's about that  A little bit  On things that are  Nowhere in the universe  Like, well, you can't talk  About your kids at all  Don't talk about your kids  Jesus  And so I understand it  I think we all debate  Like what the line is  I remember after the  After 9-11  You know, you felt like  Saturday Night Live  Was kind of soft  For a little while 
[02:36:30]  Like they didn't want  To touch Bush Cheney  Because we had to support them  Because we're going to go to war  And we can't call them  Morons anymore  And then suddenly they did it  A sketch  And this is when I knew  It was over  The premise was  That Cheney was basically  In charge  And Bush basically  Just blows him  And then it's over  And it was like  Okay, they've completely  Come back to  Yeah, yeah  Something else  So, yeah, it is weird 
[02:37:00]  And I  What can you do?  It's two days beforehand  And it's a joke  From a year and a half ago  Yeah, yeah  It was very uncomfortable  In the theater  I'm not going to lie  Oh, I'm sure  But it doesn't take away  From the movie  But it was like  Wow  Yeah, and I think  In your head  You're like  Oh, that joke  Suddenly has a different context  Yeah, yeah  Yeah, I mean  Unfortunately  Bad timing  But what are you going to do?  And do you think of that  When you  Obviously, you know  You hear of a horrible  Thing like this  And it's not the first  Thing you think of  But do you  As the day goes by  Go, holy shit  We got that  Oh, absolutely  No, the second it happens 
[02:37:30]  I'm like  Oh, that joke's  Going to be weird  But I've seen it happen  So many times  And it's happened to us  So many times  And I have to say  I kind of avoid  In all my work  Things that I think  Like people will go like  Oh, I feel bad  Because someone in my family  Died in a plane crash  Or like  There's a certain type of joke  I avoid on purpose  Which I might even  You know  Be way too sensitive  Like  Yeah, but someone  Went through that  So I don't want to  Go find that 
[02:38:00]  But, you know  The point of making jokes  Is to make us feel better  And to pop the tension  About how shocked we are  That the world  Makes no sense  So what are we going to do  Not talk about things  Yeah  So it's tricky  What do you guys do  You guys have to talk about it  For three hours  Every day  Four hours a day  Yeah, yeah  Try to work your way  Through it, I guess  Yeah  Try to do the right thing  At the moment  You know  Yeah, we've been  Railing the fucking news  Pretty much on this one 
[02:38:30]  Because they're talking  About every other thing  That might be responsible  For this  But they're not talking  About the fact  That they're pretty much  Making a comic book  Superhero villain  Out of these killers  And, you know  If you're going to  Cash in your chips  What's that  If you're going to  Kill yourself  And go out in a  Blaze of glory  What better way to do it  Than get on the news  And become that anti-hero  They should at least  Add it to the discussion  Well, I think  I couldn't agree  With that more  When Columbine happened 
[02:39:00]  I was immediately  Disgusted with how  It becomes  This  It's a story  That you can make  Hundreds of episodes  Of  Entertainment news  Out of  And so they have  Okay, we've got visuals  And we have interviews  With the survivors  And the parents  And the experts  And so for months  On Columbine  They were repackaging it  And you know  Those shows  They're paid for  By advertisers  It's no different 
[02:39:30]  Than an episode  Of Law and Order  To a television network  So on some level  They're thrilled  To have something  That people are  Really interested in  And if you're nuts  And you see something  A billion times  You're like  Well, what are my options  In my misery right now?  Yeah  I do believe that  It gets in people's head  And in the 1800s  You know  I mean, I also agree  You shouldn't be able  To get certain weapons  That kind of  Make it way easier  But I think there's  I don't know  What you could do culturally  You can't stop 
[02:40:00]  The idea that  There's going to be  So much entertainment  News about this  Yeah  But it becomes  A talking point  Like what it really is  Is like  But we said the other day  Both sides use it  To strengthen their argument  That that event  An anti-gun crusader  And an NRA member  Can both use that event  As an amazing  Jumping off point  To strengthen their argument  The exact same event  So that's all it is  It's just  It's just the thing  In the middle of the room  That everybody's pointing at  And discussing  And it just  It loses any emotional impact  Completely  I kind of disagree with that 
[02:40:30]  Because I was just going to say  That this is so emotional  That this is why  They're having this discussion  And the NRA  Are on their heels  No, no  I mean the media  I'm not talking about the NRA  The media themselves  Not the press  But I think  Jetta said it  Which is like  They can say it  Ad nausea  Like when they  When they  Like I think it's inappropriate  To show funerals  I think that the people  Should have their  Their space  And that the news  Should  I think they're trying  To be as respectful  As possible  But they're not  And that 
[02:41:00]  That is crossing a line  Like if you were a comic  On stage  And you said something  And you'd be like  Okay, I know  I just took it too far  And the crowd's groaning  Then you would know  Like okay  Crossing a line  In my mind  I'm watching this  I want the news  I want the story  But I don't want to see that  I know that  As a person who's lost people  That's terrible  That's their moment  But they're not being  It's not helping them  They're not even trying  To be respectful  They're trying to get  As close as they can  Without sparking a stampede  Like they don't care  If they cared about  Being respectful  They wouldn't ask kids  Fucking Dr. Phil 
[02:41:30]  I know that  This jizz bucket  He sits there  And asks the kid  Were you scared  To go back to school  Like what do you  What do you think  She's going to say  Like how do you go there  And ask a kid that  Well he's just trying  To get some tears going  Makes me a better TV  We all know that  When these events come up  You always have to decide  How deep are you going to  Go into watching  The parade of it  With Columbine  I just  I couldn't stop watching it  I was devastated  But I watched  And 9-11  I mean to this day  I've got this stack  Of documentaries 
[02:42:00]  And I go back to them  All the time  And I watch it  With this one  As soon as it happened  I was like  I'm going to read  A teeny bit of the paper  I'm going to watch  Zero TV  I haven't watched any TV  And I'm going to  Catch up on it  Over a month  But I don't want to  Fully immerse  Because it's just  It's too much  They're embedded  You've got plenty of time  They're embedded  In that town  They're not leaving  Anytime soon  But you make a good point  About 9-11  I watched everything  My line was  The people jumping  That's when I turned  Off the TV  I was like  Whoa 
[02:42:30]  I cannot fucking watch that  Everyone has their line  I watched it  When it happened  But now  I won't watch it  Like now  I won't watch  Old news footage  Of that  It's tough to watch  Yeah because  I mean  Obviously you know  What happened  You know how it ends  Yeah I don't want to  Dwell on it  It's weird though  You're right  Like immersing yourself  In that  Some people just  Some people just  Dive in  Like head first  And stay in it  And like  What are you doing  To yourself  Sounds stupid  But we're part of the problem  Because as we bitch about it  We're all going to  Go watch some more today  Right  No I  You haven't watched really 
[02:43:00]  I've really steered clear  Of it  I've watched a lot  We're not interviewing  Family members  We're just fucking  Trying to be funny with it  And attack the people  Who are exploiting it  I'm getting mad at the coverage  But I find myself watching  So what's that about  You know what I mean  You feel like you have to watch it  Almost  Like it's part of the national  It's a national tragedy  It's like our country's tragedy  So it's beyond  You know  But they absolutely  Have a responsibility  That they  I feel they  You know  Blow off still  I don't know  It's just 
[02:43:30]  I just go also  To all the other tragedies  In the world  And so  It impacts me differently  Because I also get angry  And think  This happens in Syria  Like every five minutes  All day  And in the Congo  By the hundreds of thousands  That's true  People could care less  And what is  You know  Our lack of interest  About  I mean in Chicago  Kids get killed  Every day of the week  There's been 60  But in the Congo  There's a kid army though  In Chicago since  60 shootings in Chicago  Since the  Since the school shooting  Yeah  But you know 
[02:44:00]  You just kind of  Well whatever  Something about  There's something about  Like a lot in a day  Or a certain  But you know  There's all sorts of  Major violence problems  But they're not  They don't package as well  Yeah  And so people don't  I mean Chicago  More people die in Chicago  Than in the Iraq war  Right  And it's all kids  And so why  Aren't people  Flipping out about that  In a very serious way  People have an easier time  We were talking about Columbine  The reason it was easier  To swallow than this  Even though it was awful  Was a peer 
[02:44:30]  Shooting people  They see as peers  It's terrible  But it's easier to comprehend  Because we all have peers  We don't like  It's when somebody  Like an adult  Is shooting somebody weak  Like children  Complete innocence  Like even when you hear  About a fucking workplace massacre  It's always terrible  Right  But everybody thinks  That one guy at work  Did like the fucking smash  It's like  It's not incomprehensible  You know  It's like  Wow how did you snap like that  Fucking rough man  Real rough  So you collect autographs  I hear  I do  I do  Your transitions  Are so seamless  Thank you  Thank you John 
[02:45:00]  I'm hoping you would notice  Yeah  I do  I do  I went to an autograph store  Yesterday and I found  A Bob and Ray autograph  Bob and Ray  And I had never seen  One of those  Have you ever heard  Bob and Ray  Chris Elliott's dad  Legendary comedy  Bob Elliott  From Get a Life  Was in a radio comedy team  And their stuff  Is just insanely funny  Have you ever heard it  Absolutely yeah  And when he did his show  What was it called again  Chris's show 
[02:45:30]  Oh the new one  No no the old one  Oh Get a Life  Get a Life  His dad would play his dad  Right  How do you display  Because I'm a collector too  Like I have to get them  Signed myself usually  But I love shit like that  Like how do you display  Them in your house  I don't really display them  They would just take up  Too much space  And my wife has zero  Interest in the idea  Of me like hanging up  Paul Lind autographs  That's a cool one  Yeah so I don't  And I keep buying them  You know  Because I get a kick  Out of letters  Like old 
[02:46:00]  Like pissed off  Groucho Marx letters  Oh cool  I look for weird  Things like that  And  Do you actually  Have one of those  I do  And I have a lot  Of letters from  I have a lot of  Letters from writers  Telling people  They have no time  For them  Because they're  Busy writing  I don't know why  But I have all  These letters  Like Patty Chayefsky  Someone saying  Like will you do  This project with us  And him saying  No I'm writing a movie  Leave me alone  Very busy  So as a reminder  To myself  So but I  I did this day  Like I'll go 
[02:46:30]  Get him  I was on  Jimmy Fallon last night  And Tom Cruise was there  And it's very hard  For me not to  Don't you  I always get a picture  I mean you  I get the picture  I got the picture  But to get an autograph  We gotta ask you  What's your prized possession  Of all of those  Yeah  Or one right up there  Well you know  Some of them are just personal  Like my grandfather  Who hated getting autographs  And he would  Live in Beverly Hills  He would bump into people  They got  When I was a kid  They met Ringo Starr  And this was like in 76  And it blew our minds 
[02:47:00]  Like you were in the room  With Ringo Starr  And he got me  Cary Grant  When I was a kid  So you know  Things like that  You still have them  Yeah I still have all of them  Where do you keep them  I actually had a Groucho Marks  Autograph  I met Groucho  Right before he died  Everyone goofs on me  It's like how old are you  But it was  It was in the 70s  And he was at some event  Where I mean  Like Artie Johnson  From Laughin was there  Wow  It was like one of these  Weird kind of fucking events  I don't know  Ben Gazzaro was there 
[02:47:30]  I got a Ben Gazzaro  You got a Ben Gazzaro  Oh that's a good one  Damn that is a good one  I'll trade you that  For an Armand Asante  Yes  You know what  I like the rejection letters  Of something that  Like you know  Gorm with the wind  Take this shit out of here  No one will ever believe  A wizard and a tin man  What kind of  Porn are you making here  I haven't talked about  The movie yet  Yeah right  This is 40  This is 40  By the way  It comes out Friday  Yes  I don't know if you've heard about that  Is this technically a sequel  Would you consider it a sequel 
[02:48:00]  Well you know  Remember it's like  If they did a movie  About Carlton your doorman  You know  Right  It's a spin off  We you know  When I was a kid  They always did  You know  Mary Tyler Moore  Then there'd be Rhoda  Yeah  Or there was a Frasier  After Cheers  So I  Or After MASH  After MASH  Yes  After MASH  Exactly  That's forgettable  Joanie loves Chachi  Let's not forget  Exactly  So we  I always got a kick out  As a kid  So when we did  Forgetting Sarah Marshall  Afterwards we were like  It'd be good to make  Like a whole movie  About Russell  That character 
[02:48:30]  Seems kind of fun  So then we did  Get him to the Greek  And it felt like  Well if we like  Any of these characters  From any of these movies  It'd be fun to see  Where else they go  So you just had  A lot of extra scenes  I had a lot of extra scenes  Now  Why Graham Parker?  Well Graham Parker  Someone we've all forgot about  Well Graham Parker  Is just a great  Hilarious guy  He was  You know  Graham Parker came out  In 1974  Like before Elvis Costello  And before 
[02:49:00]  The Clash  And he was one of the  You know the first  Kind of great rockers  Of that generation  He never sold  An enormous amount  Of records  But he was a very  Influential guy  And I would buy his records  For the last 30 years  And I could just tell like  I don't think anyone else  Is buying these records  But I thought they were great  And they were like  Also like  You know he can rock  But he's also like funny  And he's pissed off  And I like  Like rockers  Like Warren Zeban  Who are kind of mad  And funny  And so I needed a guy  Who would be  In the movie  Larry Sanders style  And admit that  They can't sell records  So then you're like 
[02:49:30]  Who could I say that to  To their face  Everyone in this room  And so I took Graham  Out to lunch  And told him  And he just laughed  His ass off  He's like  Oh so I'm the loser  In the movie  Oh man  You're gonna shit on me  I'm like  Well no  You're the king  But it's the record business  Is somewhat in shambles  And unless you're Rihanna  You're not selling  Millions of records  And there's 200 guys  Like Graham  That we love  From the 70s and 80s  Who don't sell records  And make kind of  Great records still  So he was up for it 
[02:50:00]  So he was getting  The band back together  They hadn't played  Together in 30 years  Wow  The rumor  The rumor  And he recorded a record  With his own money  With the rumor  And he was doing it anyway  And so then we put  You know the rumor  In the movie  Made that part of the premise  And now the hilarious part is  The movie's so much  Predicated on  Their failure  That as a result  Of the movie  They're on a sold out tour  They got a great record  With rave reviews  And Rolling Stone  And so you know  Which would happen  At Larry Sanders  Anybody who  Didn't mind you 
[02:50:30]  Just calling him  An asshole  On the show  Looked so funny  And cool  You're like  That guy can't be an asshole  Because he's part  Of this joke  Right  But some people  Would get very  Don't say that  I don't want people  To think that about me  And they never looked  As good  So it's you know  The self satire  You gotta go all the way  Who took the best beating  On Larry Sanders  Like who was most willing  To really get a good  Smashing  You know  I'm trying to remember  I mean people  By the end of it  Would go for it  Pretty hard  I remember  Bob Goldthwait 
[02:51:00]  Was on the show  And he was really funny  And he was really funny  And always one of my favorites  Sandler was in  Shakes the Clown  You know  So he's one of those guys  When we were starting up  You know  Was always one of our favorites  And he didn't realize  That in scenes  He wasn't in  That they were attacking him  The joke  You know  Was continuing  Outside of his scenes  And I remember  Like him saying  Somebody  He's just like  I didn't know  You guys were doing that  And I guess it hurts 
[02:51:30]  Because it's true  But he was great  And then he's fantastic  In the show  And I remember  Steven Wright  Was pretty  Pretty great  On the show  We had him in here  And he did like  In the episode  He was slamming  Bob Goldthwait  And he goes  I don't like that guy  He's got weird energy  But people are generally  Pretty cool  That's a good Steven Wright  Yeah I guess  There's a badge of honor  About taking a beating  And like you said  People know you're in  On the joke  And so nobody really  Is going to say you can't 
[02:52:00]  Although I heard  Lohan just did this thing  With Charlie Sheen recently  And she  They said was a much  She was in on it  Yeah she was the first  Hesitant  But now  Was that Scary Movie 5  Yeah but I think  That was after  She clogged the toilet  And then got back  To work  5 days of production  Shut down  Or whatever it was  Really  What happened  She clogged the toilet  Which of course  Made me like her more  But then she  Flooded the bathroom  Or something  Or there was  Some shit that happened  That's an old rehab trick  Yeah yeah  It slowed down  But I  You know I kind of feel like 
[02:52:30]  Even like in our movies  It is like Larry Sanders  And you're just like  Doing it to yourself  Also  Like you could do  The same kind of approach  To talking about  Your family  And all the problems  You're going through  As a person  And by kind of  You know  Really being rough  On yourself  You're showing like  How much everybody  Is struggling  With the same kind of  Ideas in their life  And I noticed that  With Shandling  Where we would do  The Larry Sanders show  And something would happen  In his life  And then it would  Kind of like  Slowly work its way  Into the show 
[02:53:00]  I remember  Dana Carvey  Did a vicious impression  Of him  On Saturday Night Live  Like a really mean one  And Gary was  Not pleased about it  You know  It wasn't even  Like a good joke  It was just like  He was whining  The whole time  And there was no  It wasn't even  A great sketch  And so  He called Dana  And Dana was like  I'm so sorry  I didn't write it  I think Robert Smeichel  Wrote it actually  And Gary goes  Well we'll just do  Something on the show  About it  And then he wrote  An episode  Where Dana Carvey 
[02:53:30]  Was the guest host  And just did the  Vicious Larry Sanders  Impression  And then he's like  I just let him  Guest host the show  And he was  Screwed on me  The whole time  So you know  That kind of  Was a reminder  Like alright  You can blur that line  And people connect  More to it  You mentioned family  Your family's in this movie  Obviously  Your daughters are  Really good actors  Actresses I should say  And is that your mom  In the movie  I just need to know  For my own  My grandma  It is your grandma  My grandma  Says a cameo  Where she says  To Leslie 
[02:54:00]  You're 40  You know  Don't blink  Because you'll blink  And you'll be 90  Which is  What she always says to me  And then I saw her sister  Who's 86  And she has a variation  Which is  Don't blink  Because you'll be dead  Is she the older sister?  My grandma  Is the older sister  She's 90  So she's 90  And she's in the  Wow  She's in the movie  And now she's in a nursing home  And she's doing well  For years  We didn't know  If we could get her  To go to a nursing home  She's very independent  She loves it 
[02:54:30]  But it is like  High school  At the nursing home  Like people  You know  Your stuff is immature  And I always say  Everyone is immature  And then you go  To this nursing home  They're all 90  Some are like 100  And my grandma's like  They won't let you sit  With them at the table  At lunch  They're a clique  It's exactly the same  That lady  She yelled at me  Because I played the piano  In the sitting room  It never is  It never is  Like Pauly's mother  In The Sopranos  When she went to the  To the old age home 
[02:55:00]  And that's exactly  What it was  They won't sit with me  At the table  They won't play cards  You know  She tattles on everybody  It's like a bunch of children  I don't know why  People want to be mature  You know  Like that's always  Like an attack  Like you're being immature  It's always  Like it's a goal  Right  Yeah  It's a lot more fun  To be immature  It's always hard  To talk about these movies  When you guys come in here  Because you don't want  To give away the jokes  And stuff  But I do want to say this  You gotta  You know  Stay through the credits  The blooper was amazing  With Melissa McCarthy  Well Melissa McCarthy  Is really  Hilarious  You know  I didn't know who she was 
[02:55:30]  I guess she's been around  A long time  And I just hadn't seen  We all know her  From Bridesmaids  Yeah she was  Mike and Molly  And Mike and Molly  After that  But that's when we first  But she was at Gilmore Girls  I guess for like seven years  Yeah I don't know  I didn't know  But she came in  Yeah see I hadn't seen it  I knew that stuff  And then she walked in  And you're like  Oh this is like one of the  Crazy funny people  Of all time  And then you know  She's doing two scenes  In my movie  And they're the funniest  Scenes in the movie  Killed them  By far  Yeah  That's right  And I don't know 
[02:56:00]  She's just  You know she has a thing  That's like Farley  She reminds me of Chris Farley  A little bit  And when she like  Looks you in the eye  And she's like  Doing the scene  She  There's a madness there  That makes you laugh  That you don't get  Out of most people  Where they're like  Truly gone  In a way that's  Oh wow  I could tell  But the blooper scene  The blooper scene  With the principal  Is a massive laugh  Yeah  When you went and saw it  Wow  Yeah she's  Good for you Judd  I was not gonna  I don't want to take it off  The movie  Because I know  That's she here to talk about  But I just want to ask  Your opinion 
[02:56:30]  Since you're so well respected  In the comedy world  That  You asking me or Judd  Both of you actually  But more him  What  Do you think that we live in now  Like you brought up  The Gary Shandling show  You brought up all these shows  Do you think that we live  In a new golden age  Of like TV comedy  Like with Louie  And like all these shows  And stuff like that  I think so  I mean when I look at it  Girls  Is like a dramedy  I guess you would call it  I mean I guess you could go  We've never beaten the  All in the family moment 
[02:57:00]  But that's society  Yeah I mean that was like  Part of the whole culture  Getting behind something  Like it's not like  People are watching  Any of these things  In mass  Where 45 million people  Are watching Louie  As they should  Yeah  And also I would go  As far as to say  Probably none of it  Is as good as  All in the family  I think like there  Were a couple of things  Back then  Like you couldn't do  All in the family  Right now  Absolutely  I agree with that  I mean I guess you could say  South Park kind of does it  But in terms of like  The whole world  Watching it 
[02:57:30]  And I don't think  You could do  Blazing Saddles right now  We don't accept  Commentary from anybody  Real commentary  Is only accepted  From cartoons now  We're a country of dopes  We won't take real  Social comedy  Commentary  Unless it's done  By a cartoon character  It's a  Yeah it's a political  It's a mob mentality  It's embarrassing  But there's way more  Great comedy  I think  And I think  It is a golden era  I remember when like  Spies Like Us came out  I just thought  This is going wrong  This is going the wrong way 
[02:58:00]  It just felt like  A lot of people  Getting big paychecks  And doing a lot of drugs  And it didn't feel like  There was a passion  Behind what they were saying  It was like  Let's do a spy movie  And that's what  We always avoid  Like just like  The high concept premise  Like we try to write  About something  That we care about  Even if it's dumb  Like something we're  Like desperately passionate  To talk about  And Louie has just  Changed the game  I think for everybody  He's like  This is how hard  You can work  This is how many times  You can turn over your act  Here's how honest  You can be  Here's how  You could write 
[02:58:30]  You could direct  You can edit  So I mean  He's basically  Laying down the gauntlet  To everyone  Like you know  Why are you all so lazy  Because you know  You go on the road  How often is the comic  On the road writing  I mean that's what I know  Is I go on the road  And I would never  Write jokes during the day  But then you'd be on the road  With like Larry Miller  Or someone  And he's like  Yeah I'm going to go write  For a couple hours  I'm like what  Oh that's why  You could do two hours  And I have eight minutes  And four of it is  Talking to the crowd  So I think  Don't you think  Louis changed that  For people 
[02:59:00]  That bastard  Yes  Well it's funny  That you brought up  All in the family  Because that was like  They were breaking taboos  And they were breaking  They were doing like  Really like good things  Comedically  That are inappropriate  And like SNL  Did that in the beginning too  And then  There became this whole wave  And these guys  You know  To these guys  They also  Serve that purpose  Of like pushing the envelope  Saying the  Saying the  Inappropriate  Appropriate thing  And I feel like now 
[02:59:30]  That people have been so  Politicized  Into like saying that  Oh that word  Grown  Wrong  Whatever  And then a horrific act  Like the shooting happens  And people don't know how to react  So they react  Harsely on the guy  Saying his  His joke  Or his whatever  Or the movie  To like somehow  Balance the scale  And it never will  So I know  I'm putting a lot of things together  But I would say that  Yes we will never have  Those kind of shows again  Because the people don't want them  They don't want that  They don't want that 
[03:00:00]  The advertisers don't want it  Because the people don't want it  And people pull the ads  Like let's start with the Aflac duck  You know like  Pulling Gilbert over that  Yeah yeah  That was ridiculous  Over a joke  You know  Special interest groups  Are what has  The rise of special interest groups  Is what has ruined it  Because there's so much money at stake  That people are afraid  The special interest group  Will boycott the product  And that will hurt the networks  So the network just reacts  And you don't think  We can turn that around  You really don't think  We can turn that around eventually  Not at all  I mean people aren't going to get cooler  I know that 
[03:00:30]  Well it's related to every industry  There's a great documentary out now  Called The House I Live In  And it's all about  The drug sentencing  And how we've created this prison system  Where there's private prisons  They give money to politicians  They keep all of the sentencing  Really draconian  So for possession  You could be doing 10, 20 years  But they're filling beds  And filling beds  Is making them money  And it's very hard  To turn that back  Only the states 
[03:01:00]  Going bankrupt  From having too many people in jail  Is going to change  Drug sentencing  And it's the same with  I guess probably the NRA  Which is gun companies  Pay these people a lot of money  They have salaries  So they're fighting for weapons  That it's hard for anyone  To say you need that  I mean I guess  There's an argument  For some of it  But there's definitely a line  But why don't they go  Yeah I guess maybe  We're pushing it there  You can't have a  We get all of it  But someone is paying  For that position  I think  Of course 
[03:01:30]  Well I think if you take  The violence out of these movies  They suck  And honestly  You know we're not European  We're not story people  We're not you know  Drama and you know  Big picture  So you know  Be careful what happens  I think with the whole  You know  You're talking about  In terms of the culture  Like pulling back violence  In movies  Yeah America will never do that  I mean if anything  What's fascinating  Is that there's PG-13 movies  That are crazy violent  But there's like a rule  That if you don't show blood  You can do anything  And so 
[03:02:00]  Where in Europe  They're totally against  The violence in movies  You have to be much older  To see them  And they're okay with the sex  It's like  It's inverted  We're here  We're weird about  And all our movies  Are shown over there anyway  I mean all these major  Violent films in America  Has are shown  It's not like  They're just kept here  They just I guess  React for differently  For different reasons  And speaking of sex  The movie opens up  With a nice sex scene  That's right  Judd Apatow  This is 40  I'm going to sell  Some tickets for you  Yeah come on  It's hard to sex  You have to start a movie  With your wife and friend 
[03:02:30]  Making love  You know  That's my decision  That's something  I want to see  How do you direct that  This is cock holding  That was the other time  I look away  I just go  You know  Do make it look good  And I look away  Do you really look away  Look away  Obviously it's all acting  But it's got to be strange  On some kind of line  Of course  They don't like it  So I get a kick  Out of making them do it  Unless they're faking it  And they might be faking it  I make them do it  And so the opening scene  Is them having sex  And afterwards  Paul admits  That he took a Viagra  And they get into  Like a crazy fight 
[03:03:00]  Immediately after the sex  And I've never  I actually took a Viagra  Once  A friend gave me one  I was wondering  Like what it did  And then I was  Literally afraid  To pursue my wife  And so I just  Walked around the house  With a boner  All night long  Why were you afraid  Because I thought  If I told her  She would get mad  I was like  Oh so I can't tell her  That this is needed  And so I just  Panicked  And didn't do anything  That's how I thought  Of the scene  Like oh  What if I told her  And she was just like  What the fuck  Why would you need that 
[03:03:30]  Why do you need that  With me  But you just want to  Know the power of it  You want to know  If it really does  Turbocharge you  Amazing  And you use it  Just in general life  Constantly  I constantly take Cialis  And you never tell them  They just touch it  And you're like  Wow look at that  I'm a man  It's fun to feel like that  What would happen  If you didn't take it  Like what's your status  Without it  Here's what happens  I bat about 120  And I'm sitting there  In the bed going  I took a Dramamine  You know because I flew  It's a nightmare  It's a nightmare  So there's no reason  Not to  There's no downside really  We all should just be on it  24 hours a day 
[03:04:00]  All the time  But it does  I guess there's that thing  Like when you get older  You don't want to admit  Anything's changing  Right  But the great thing  About the Viagra  Is those commercials  If you watch them  The guy in the commercial  Always is tall and skinny  With the perfect gray  Short haircut  And he looks like  The most awesome dick  Like he looks like  An erection  Like you want to be him  But he looks fantastic  You want to suck him  Subliminal advertising  Exactly  Can I say one thing  About your wife 
[03:04:30]  Who's super super cool  She's sexy  That when I was  In your movie  Funny People  That was my favorite part  Was after the shooting  When I was already  Thinking about like  You know this is like  Probably the only movie  I'm ever going to do  Because I suck as an actor  It's alright  I'm very bad as well  Okay  But I didn't say you were  I thought you were delightful  You did say as well though  Okay you said as well  Yeah  I know  I could care less  But my favorite part  Was when we were all  Going back to the other camp  Whatever wherever  And you said  Do you need a ride  Dave  And I got to ride  In the van 
[03:05:00]  With you  Your wife  And your kids  And I didn't know  I was in there  With like a group  Of future thespians  And I was like  This super hot chick  Who's really cool  With two  I was like  And this guy's like  The really funny director  I'm like  This is like the life  I never will have  Because this guy's amazing  So  Oh thank you  It was like a make a wish  Looking in  Little face pressed up  Against  What's happening  They may be available  For you soon  What your kids  You know I get divorced  At some point  You could get the whole package  The whole package  Just swings over to you  You keep banging out 
[03:05:30]  These bromances  And comedies  I like them too  They're nice  What is this rate  In this movie  It's rated R  It is  Whoa  Good  It's rated R  You can't really do anything  Not rated R  Comedically  I mean I guess  What makes it an R really  I mean there is a  Well just if you say  Fuck twice  If you say fuck twice  That's all it takes now  Yeah which is crazy  In America  You know my kids  That's so frustrating  My kids have seen everything  Like just having  Kids you see that  You could assume  That you can block things 
[03:06:00]  But you can't  The second they go  To a friend's house  They could just stay up  And just watch any movie  They could watch Breaking Bad  They can watch  American Horror Story  Great job  And so  I just try to  Have a relationship with them  Where they'll talk to me  About it  My daughter who's 10  She has a funny thing  She'll like search things  Like on YouTube  All the time  And then if it's  Something shocking  Comes up  She instantly searches  The word bunny  And then it just shows  Like a bunny  And so  That's how I know  She saw something bad  Because I'll hear her go 
[03:06:30]  Bunny  And then she's  So like the other day  They were searching  Well they love  American girl dolls  So they like these dolls  They look up  American boy  Which is a gay porn site  And then I just hear  Bunny  Or they look up  Like inflatable  They were looking up  Like rafts  So they look up  Inflatable toys  Which is not rafts  That's funny  The default is always porn  You're only  It's like  What are you like  Two clicks away usually  Maybe 
[03:07:00]  I needed for my luggage  A strap on  Oh no  Did you  But they're gonna see everything  So then it becomes  A question of  Will they tell you  Will they help you decode it  And do they just hide in their room  And look at it for hours  Or are they gonna  Do what I did  Which is kind of get freaked out  And never look again  Until college  But is everything  I don't know  I don't have kids  So is everything your business  I mean like  Eventually they're gonna have  Their own lives  I feel like that's  That's the world that we live in  You seem like a really good parent 
[03:07:30]  That like eventually  They're gonna have to have  Their own life  And we won't be their filter  Well I think that  It's a joke to think  That you're really filtering them  You're not filtering them  You're sneaky  You're developing a relationship  With them where my kids  Will tell me  They looked up  American boy  And then if they go like  Oh my god  It was crazy  What did you see  And then  Then you could explain  Well I don't know  Some people like to have  Blow up toys  In the shape of women  And I guess  I don't know  How we feel about that  You mean  You actually do  With Zelmo puppet  You actually do parenting  That's crazy 
[03:08:00]  Yeah  I mean I don't think  There's anything else  You can do  Because you know  We try to be a little bit  More like  The Frank Zappa family  Like they're not gonna die  If they hear the F curse  I mean it's  It'll be fine  It's just language  I'm more about like  Being cruel  Like are you being mean  To people  Are you judgmental  But you know  Words  They can enjoy Dave's act  And have a nice night  You know what I'm saying  In your television program  I don't do any rap  I want to go back  To this is 40 for a second  Because you mentioned  It's R rated 
[03:08:30]  To me that's so ridiculous  It doesn't feel like  An R rated movie  But obviously  It's the language  Which we're so uptight  With in this country  It's crazy  It's crazy  I mean  Especially because  Kids watch everything  On the internet  That has language  There's no filter  On the internet  Right  So  It is that like  Last thing  We're like  Oh my god  Bono said fuck  By accident  On the Grammys  And people debate  The fine for 10 years  While kids are just home  Watching everything  On earth  It's like a remnant  Of people 
[03:09:00]  In the bureaucracy  Who can't let go  And acknowledge  Like no it's over  The line is gone  Let me take that point  John Jackson  The nipple  It was not even a second  The outrage was incredible  But look what we're  Seeing today  With the school shooting  That's  I would  Yeah they'll show that  Just so you know  I have a two and a half year old  I would much rather him  See a dumb nipple  On TV  Than this horrific  24 hour news cycle  On the school shooting  Well it's like saying  A kid could suck  On a nipple  To eat all day long 
[03:09:30]  But can't look up  And see it  Don't look at it  The hypocrisy  Drives me nuts  What I'm getting at  I mean pay attention  You'll notice this  As a father  Watch  What happens  As you really tune  Into the amount  Of dead bodies  On the news  And on commercials  For the news  Where I'll be with my kids  And like there'll be  Like a piece  I mean there was a piece  On one of the big  Magazine shows  About Syria  And it was  Worse than any movie  I've ever seen  And there's no 
[03:10:00]  Warning about it  It just goes there  No  My example  Did you see Ted?  Yes I did  Okay so we finally  Saw it this weekend  And it starts off  A lot of cursing  Like your movie  And me and my wife  Look at each other  Our son's in the room  And we're like  You know what  We silently said  Fuck it  Let him watch  I'm not worried  About that  And then later  In the movie  When they kidnap Ted  It got really dark  And my son piped up  Like this is scary  I'm like you know what  You're right  That was my line there  But the language  I don't care  I'll explain that stuff 
[03:10:30]  To him  Yeah when people  Are like you know  People are mean  Or torture each other  You know that's  Kind of what I try  It's way worse  Than a curse  But my daughter's 15  And I'll tell you  She loves that  Breaking Bad  More than  She loves it  It's a good  So I don't know  I also start going  She's 15  Like I went to college  At 17  Like you know  Where do you let  You know  Let them kind of  Develop their own interest  That's a great  Wouldn't you rather  Have her watch that  Than the Bad Girls Club  Or like one of these other 
[03:11:00]  Like you know  Shoe Rescue  Or you know  Like one of these  Reality stupid jokes  You know  She watches those as well  Cupcake Wars  Well they love  I didn't know I was pregnant  Yes  That's their favorite  So it's like a girl  Who like twists her  Ankle  Puts on 40 pounds  And eight months later  Goes to the bathroom  And a baby comes out  I thought I got heavy  Because I twisted my ankle  I thought your daughter  Like Lost  She did  Well that's how we thought of it  It's in a movie  This is 40  She watched all of Lost  In six weeks  Oh man 
[03:11:30]  And she was crying  Like every day  She was so emotional  And she's like  This is the best show ever  But like really suffering  And going through  Too many emotions  Too fast  And we're like  What episode are you on  She's like  85  And like  Okay well she's got  25 more  So we just let her  Get through it  To get over this  Or do we stop it now  And that's a new thing  With kids too  Which is they will absorb  You know  A series  In a couple of weeks  That we took  Seven years to watch  We're just jealous  Yeah  What does that do 
[03:12:00]  To your brain  To do like a season  Of 24 in the weekend  It's healthy though  I think it's healthy  To cry through stuff like that  Because it's like  It's a good  Like I cried through  Lost too  Like it's humiliating  But I did  Because it's like  A healthy release  It's like  You should learn  That it's okay  Even if it's not  You know  Watching the news  Is what it kind of  Probably should happen  But at least you're crying  It's a healthy thing  It's not healthy  To repress  You took that real moment  And put it in  This is 40 so  Well also she puts  She used to put  The soundtrack on  In the car  And there's a song  On Lost  It's just like 
[03:12:30]  A little piano dirge  And they would always  Play it when a character  Died  And so in the car  She would just start bawling  That's the song  When Sun died  Oh that's right  She did die in the boat  Didn't she drown or something  I don't think it went well  For any of them really  Oh yeah  How did she young  Yeah I don't think it  See I'm jealous  Because like  Breaking Bad I think  Is like an old  Like an old man  Yeah  Show  You know  It's about  You know  Mortality  Choices 
[03:13:00]  Defeat  You know  Like what's her  What is it  Well I don't know  I think it's like  Seeing the drama  Of life  And then you know  Like you're a kid  And you're not exposed  To anything  And suddenly you're exposed  To all of the dramas  Of life  Through the show  And so she's fascinated  By it  And she's kind of  Hilarious  And an interesting girl  So she's  She's deep  She goes for that stuff  That's cool  And so it's a  You know  I don't know  Scary but we  Yeah  We allow it  Because we're also  Kind of excited  They like something good  Yeah  It really is good  You know  And they like  Kind of stop listening 
[03:13:30]  To like some of the  Disney music  And they like  Put on a Pearl Jam record  Without you asking  You're like  Oh this is the best  Day of my life  Yeah  Well it shows  That they're smart  Because when I was younger  I liked stuff  That was older than me  I watched the Honeymooners  When I was a kid  I watched MASH  When it was  You know  I was  I was eight  Nine years old  I enjoyed MASH  Or Clockwork  Or whatever it was  You know  You don't have to be  From that generation  To like it  Yeah  No it's great  When you're a kid  It's like  What do you do today  I just watched  The Graduate  Really  You just watched  The Graduate  By yourself  How do you think 
[03:14:00]  To watch The Graduate  That's great  What do you own  From Chayefsky  I own just  A funny letter  With him  Just him  Rejecting someone  That wanted him  To write a play  For something  But he's the best  I mean Network  Still  I mean  When you talk about  What's happening now  Oh man  The movie Network  Predicts everything  That is happening  I mean you watch  I mean literally  Watch it this week  And you'd be baffled  That some guy  Wrote this in 1976  He saw where reality TV  Was going  With the Symbian  Liberation Army  He saw all this stuff 
[03:14:30]  We say it every time  When that movie came out  There was no reality shows  There were no 24 hour news cycles  None of it  And corporations  Owning the networks  And how that would change  What they would put on them  Yeah  It's a pretty amazing  Piece of work  Or the idea of  The talking head  Which is kind of  What Peter Finch  Became at the end  We didn't have that  When that movie came out  They just gave you the news  That was it  Yeah did they really  Do editorials in the 70s  A little bit  At the end of the news  It was almost a throwaway  Like you know  They had 30 seconds left  So they did something  They'd have the station manager  Would come out  And give an editorial 
[03:15:00]  It was always a funny  And then some guy  Could give a rebuttal  But it was a big deal  Like when Walter Cronkite  Like took eight seconds  To go like  Maybe Vietnam's a bad idea  Like the whole country  Flipped out  Because no one  Said their opinion  No  It took like forever  For that to happen  You might have been the first  They said that changed  The feeling in the country  Of the war  They said Cronkite  Saying it was bad  Had a tremendous impact  On people  Because he just didn't do that  The war is unwinnable  Yeah  Is that what he said?  Yeah  And now no one  Has any impact 
[03:15:30]  At all  No  Too many voices  And they all  Are giving their opinions  That's what they're doing  They're all trying  To have impact  Everyone is trying  To have impact  But because we're watching  500 different people  No one gives a shit  What any of them say  No one cares  True  I just  You know  People think  I watch Fox  Because my political affiliations  They just have the hottest girls  More so than  That's a Patty Chayefsky idea  Which is that  The most conservative place  Would have the youngest  Blondest  Hottest women  I mean it does like 
[03:16:00]  Brainwash you  Like she thinks this  And she looks like  A sorority girl  Yes  It's a very specific  Kind of blonde look  That you get  Because Democrats  Were all like  A little dirty  It's different  It's a different  Kind of feel  Different feel  The commentators  You don't get that  Like MSNBC  Has like roller derby queens on  You gotta put some  Fucking hotter women on there  I mean  I think Rachel Maddow  Is attractive  Even though she's  Wow  I do  I know she's not  She's slightly masculine 
[03:16:30]  But she's  I think she's  Seriously  I think she's an attractive woman  She's not an ugly woman at all  She doesn't want to dress like that on TV  They dollied her up  But I'm not unattractive to her  They softened her up a little bit  You know what I mean  I mean I know she  Probably wouldn't feel that way about me  But I  Unfortunately  We're getting the wrap up  Oh boy  Okay  Judd Apatow  You don't come around enough  He's a busy guy  I might come back  I might come back  I understand he's a busy guy  More to New York  We got a place in New York  So maybe I'll come back  And you tweet a lot  I've noticed that  And you tweet pictures 
[03:17:00]  Which is very cool  Like you're not  You're not against  Being at an awards show  Or something  And taking pictures backstage  And stuff  That's kind of cool  Because that's kind of  What I would want to see  Yes  Like Tom Cruise was there last night  I'm like  I'm gonna tweet a picture  Of me and Tom Cruise  Fuck I'll tweet a picture  Come on  Let's do it right now  Has anyone turned you down  Let's keep this going  For a photo  No people are kind of pretty good  I do a funny thing  Which is like  If there's a photographer  At an event  I'll just like  Also stand near somebody 
[03:17:30]  You know like  I got a good picture  With Brad Pitt  In an event recently  Where like  This is the camera guy  I'm like  Take a picture of me  And I just like  Stand like really near him  You're still from Long Island  That's a better photo  To be like  Lurking in the background  Of a shot  With Angelina Jolie  Yeah it's like  Hey look who that is  Back there  Yeah  That's like  We took a weird picture  With me and Cruise  And Dr. Oz  I just  Oh that's  Funny people  To be in the hallway  Together  Yeah  I love what they're  Talking about  I love that he does that  I do too  I do it every time 
[03:18:00]  I do that  And he still does it  I go and get a shot  With the other guys  Yeah you get everybody  I get a lot of them  Yeah I mean  I try to  What's the weirdest  One that you got  We got  We got Bernard Getz on  I got Bernie Getz  That's pretty good  I got Sharpton  My best is Sabbath  As a band and me  But that's just  A personal love  I have a lot of  I just got Pete Townsend  The other day  That'd be a nice  What to see  The Who in Brooklyn  That's a biggie  That was a great moment  To get the Pete Townsend  It takes balls 
[03:18:30]  Because it's like  On some level  They talk to you  Like you're a normal person  That they can respect  And then right at the end  You're like  We're making pink  And all of it  All your coolness  Just goes out the window  Do you know what though  We're about to do that with you  The cycle continues  It's not like  They're going to call you  If you don't  Like you know what I mean  I figure it takes two seconds  Fuck them  Whatever  I did let him  With Ben Affleck once  And he was a really nice guy  He came into the dressing room  He's like hey  I'm like hey man  And I'm like  Do you want to take a picture  He goes alright  Like he was just coming in  To say hi 
[03:19:00]  And I took a picture  But if I didn't do that  Would he have called me  And said look  What are you doing later  I want to hang  He may have  He may have  He would have forgot about me  The minute we were done anyway  So I'm like get the pictures  So you're like ruining  The relationship right off the bat  I acknowledge  There never will be a relationship  Oh okay  Because I respect them enough  To know they're not going  To want to talk to me  Oh Jim  Seriously  We're just doing a thing together  That's it  Alright we got to get  Judd out of here  Yeah the movie is called  This is 40  It comes out this Friday  I just want to say  I liked it  I went the other day  Yeah  Absolutely  Did it reflect your life  Did it reflect my life  How long have you been married  Four years 
[03:19:30]  Four years  So you're early  Yeah  It'll slowly catch up with you  No I relate to some of the stuff  Yeah it's you know  It's meant to be like  A super funny movie  About the moment  When everything melts down  Because when you're married  You're spinning a lot of plates  You're trying to be a good dad  You're trying to be a good husband  You're trying to still  Get properly erect  And then some weeks  It all just goes to shit  And so it's just a funny look  I relate to that  A week where it collapses  I also relate it to the part  Where you have to  Fucking help out 
[03:20:00]  Your family members  And you're tired  You're tired  Jesus  They expect things from you  And you get up early  Do they let you sleep  When you get home  Like hey he was up early  Let him sleep  See I get none of that  Like daddy works hard  Let's like take his shoes  And let him relax  No huh  Most days it's  I go home and nap  But I'm aware that  I better not stay  In that room too long  Oh  You're the worst  I got two kids now  I got a two month old too  Oh wow  Yes  They don't let you sleep  There's no respect of like  When we were kids

[03:22:00]  And I've got another email  From another veteran  Who I forwarded to him  So I think that he's going to  At least hopefully move  In the right direction  But I've decided to do  More phone calls  This week  Because that just seemed  To be the more fun part  Of the show  But again the number is  866-969-1969  If you want to call in  But I will start with an email  Because this week  Obviously with the shootings  Everybody's obsessing  Over mental illness  Which I guess we should  As a country  People are just talking 
[03:22:30]  About mental illness  And I think we're all  A little fucking disgusted  With it  You know  I think we're all  A little tired  Of hearing about  Mental illness  Like it needs to be  Talked about  But we're sick  Of the effect  That the mentally ill  Have on the rest of us  And you know  Like whenever Opie  Mentions it  I feel for him so much  Because his mom  He talks about  He's very open  Had mental illness  And I get angry for him  I'm like  How the fuck  Did you deal with that?  So this email  Comes from a guy  Let's just call him  Tony 
[03:23:00]  I don't know  If he wants  His real name used  But this email  Annoyed me so much  For him  He goes  My name is Tony  My half sister  Has some kind  Of a mental  Hormonal imbalance  She's super aggressive  Disgusting  And ugly  Which sounds like  Most singles ads  That I've answered  Aggressive ugly smoker  She spends her time  Drinking energy drinks  Smoking and lifting weights  And for years  This mental problem  She's had  Leads her to constantly  Be aggressive  Manic  Physically and emotionally  Violent 
[03:23:30]  She's tall and fat  With big arms  I mention this  Because I can't  Match her physically  Nor can my parents  And certainly not  When she's manic  She's lost her job  And has no desire  To find a new one  Nor does she want  To lose weight  Or improve herself  She's lost her old place  She now lives with us  And is determined  To make everybody's  Life miserable  Reading this  For the first time  I was kind of like  I hate her  She's a hateable person  Your sister is a fucking  She sounds like  The monster  That Bugs Bunny  Did her hair  You remember that one 
[03:24:00]  Monsters  They're such interesting people  Your sister's a big galoot  And I kind of want her  To pick me up  And cuddle her  Cuddle me in her big fat arms  But I got angry  For you reading this  Email  Just thinking about  Her rage  And her bad breath  Her fucking cigarette  Energy drink  Crazy lady breath  And I will  I'll breeze through  The last part of the email  He writes  Here's her typical MO  Blame everyone and everything  For her lot in life  She does nothing to improve herself  Push push push  People into fighting her 
[03:24:30]  And when they do  She plays the victim  Example  Yesterday she blocked me  On my way up to my room  To tell me how she nearly died  And mom wouldn't help her  She was mixing her medication  With booze apparently  And when I didn't want to hear it  She knocked the glass off my head  Glasses off my head  By slapping my face  When I fought back  She then shouted  That I started everything  And that my mother and I  Were conspiring against her  It got physical  And I still can't eat properly  Because my jaw being swollen  Now he goes on 
[03:25:00]  There's a little bit more  But like first of all  The problem dude  She sounds like a fucking slob  And you should move out  As soon as possible  Or your parents should have  A little more moral courage  And throw her out  Stop coddling this fat fuck  Stop coddling this fucking fat monster  She's a detriment to your family  I say she has mental illness  And I'm sorry to hear that  But boot this fucking pig  Out of the house 
[03:25:30]  Because she's making decisions  To not take her medication  Or to mix booze with medicine  So that's my advice to you  Stop coddling  This fucking destructive slob  Had enough of mentally ill people  Fucking it up for the rest of us  And we have any phone calls tonight  I'm hoping people call on the phones  Yeah you want to go to one?  Yes  Let's go to Tony  Hi Tony  Oh Tony  Is that the Tony I just read?  No  Okay  Hello  Hi Tony yes  Hey is this Jim?  Mmhmm  Yeah

Uh  I love when they repeat themselves  Mitchell in Illinois  Hi Mitch  Hey Jim  How you doing?  Good buddy  How are you?  I am doing great  Now I'm listening to you  Oh good  Uh  I obviously  You heard the  Read the  You know  The problem  Uh  I've been married for two years 
[03:27:30]  And  My  Mother-in-law  Is  An insatiable  Whore  She uh  She's ruining  The marriage  Between my wife and I  And  And the question that I have  And it's  It's kept me up  Wait hold on  Hold on one second  Not to interrupt you  You know when you say  She's an insatiable whore  Now is she  Is she married  Or is she just fucking  A lot of different guys?  Well she's  She's married  But the problem is  That is really bothering me  Is  I  Really want to know  If you would ever consider 
[03:28:00]  Doing a show in Peoria  I'll hang up and listen  Sir that had nothing to do  With your question  Here's what I'll say  About Peoria, Illinois  It's the birthplace  Of Richard Pryor  So I have a tremendous  Affection for Peoria, Illinois  Would I do a show there?  Probably not  Why?  Because I don't think  Peoria's people  Would enjoy me  I think that's pretty much  Am I wrong  That that's a black area?  And uh  I just don't think 
[03:28:30]  I would draw very well there  I don't think black people  Enjoy me on stage  So to answer your question  Yes you should fuck  Your mother-in-law  And B  No I will not come to Peoria  So it's a yes and a no  Alright who's next?  Trav  Trav dog on the phones today  Let's do John  Hi John  Yes sir  Hey Jimmy  Morning how are you?  Hi buddy  Um I'm married  I got two kids  The oldest  The youngest kid rather  Is ten  After my wife had  Our second kid  She stopped  Like being into sex 
[03:29:00]  And I can't  Go down on her  I can't see her naked  We have sex  Once or twice a week  In missionary position  And what happened is  I got a couple girlfriends  In the past  Because I need  You know you need  That type of initiation  You need that type  Of emotional  And physical love  And then  But the girls are crazy  They become attracted to me  They want to marry me  And it becomes a whole thing  Oh you mean girlfriends  On the side  Yeah  Oh okay  But I don't like that  Because then they  You know girls get  Fucking crazy  And they  So anyways  I started getting into  Cross dressing  And going to 
[03:29:30]  Like transsexual clubs  And that type of stuff  But I'm not into gay guys  And I'm  It's like  It's a weird thing  Let me ask you  Is there somebody  On the phone  Or am I just  Thinking out loud  I'm kidding  I'm kidding  Sorry  But well maybe  It's just  Maybe you're just bored  Like you know  Either maybe  Maybe you just  Like transsexuals  Because they turn you on  And they've always  Turned you on  Or maybe it's a new high  It's a hard thing to say  Because you might  Just be bored  Like sometimes 
[03:30:00]  With especially  With computers  Looking around  Like if it wasn't  For computers  I never would have  Watched a horse  Fuck a guy to death  I never would have  Watched a chicken  Getting fucked  But because you can  Click on a link  And see it  You do  And occasionally  We stumble on  New turn-ons  Doing that  Like  I think that maybe  Is what happened to you  Unless you used to  Like trannies  No no  I never thought about  Liking trannies  Or anything like that  But then  If I wasn't getting  Any sex or anything  From my wife 
[03:30:30]  Yeah I see stuff  On the computer  And then I start googling  And they have  So you know  There's some places  In New York and Boston  That I go to  And you can meet  Girls like that  And it was very  Attractive and hot  So you were having  Sex with them  Were you at least  Using protection  And don't lie  Oh yeah yeah  I've only had sex  With them a few times  But I like hanging out  With them and talking  With them  And they give  The best blowjob  You ever want to have  You know that  I've heard  Only one Asian girl  I had to have sex  With me a few times  And then that was it  Because I'm nervous  About diseases 
[03:31:00]  Yeah you should be  Nervous about diseases  And I think a lot of it  Is a lot of times  What happens to married  People from what I've heard  Is that the women  You know they go  Into the mother mode  And they don't become  As experimental sexually  And maybe the guys  Don't want to fuck them  Anymore because there's  A kid there  And she's the mother  Of your child  I don't know what happens  It does change things  From what I've been told  I'll tell you what happens  Me and my  A lot of my friends  I know  And I don't  Talk about the  Training things  With my friends  But all  Most of my friends  Nine out of ten of them  As soon as the women  Have kids 
[03:31:30]  They just become  Assholes  Their hormones go crazy  And they nag rag you  They don't want to have sex  And they blame you  For everything  And they're just  They're just fucking assholes  So it's like  It's very unbearable  Now  Sometimes it doesn't happen  Like I know  Opie says it doesn't  You know if you have  Tons of dough  I do very well  But if you have tons of dough  And maybe  Maybe they have  A different relationship  But nine out of ten  Of my friends  And people I know  After they have kids  It's just fucking torture  Yeah that's what I've heard  I mean  Again most people 
[03:32:00]  Do fall into that category  I don't know what to tell you  Come on  Did you ever look at  Transsexuals before  When you were growing up  Or think about it  Or jerk off thinking  About your friends  Or anything  No I never even knew  About transsexuals  To be honest with you  Growing up  I never even thought  About it  The first time  I saw a transsexual  I was in college  We were at  Some video place  Me and my roommate  We were getting some videos  And they had an x-ray detection  We went in the back  And he like picked one up  It was called  She-mail nurse  Or something  He started showing it to me  He said  Hey look at that  She-mail nurse  You like she-mails  And then I looked at it 
[03:32:30]  And I was like  That's a little bit different  Who was in that  Was that Sulca  She was a famous  Transsexual star  From years ago  Sulca  I don't know who it was  We didn't rent it  Or anything  But I remember  You know  And then after that  I didn't really realize it  And then until I  And that was  Early 90s  And then porn  Wasn't on the computer  Then but as soon as  Porn was on the computer  I realized it  And I  Some of those sites  Are really hot  So I was like  Oh man  I like this shit  Alright well  Good luck brother  I don't know what I can  Help you with  But I hope it works out  And you know  Try to get your wife 
[03:33:00]  To be naked  And a little dirtier  Because you don't want  To just totally lose her  Alright thanks Jimmy  Be good brother  Bye  Trap dog  Who's next  Ryan  Oh  Ryan  Hello Ryan  Yeah hey Jim  How's it going buddy  I'm good buddy  How are you  I've been okay  I'm pretty much  Addicted to  Snorting oxycodones  Nobody in my family  Knows whatsoever  I've hidden it  Very very well  It's about a  Seven to eight hundred 
[03:33:30]  Dollar habit  A week  Wow  And I  I just  I want to get help  But I can't  I don't know what  Step  I can't go to rehab  Why not  What am I going to  Tell my family  You know  I got to take a check  You know go away for 30 days  To go to rehab  I just don't know  How to explain it  To my wife  To my family  I just  It's really gotten  A grasp of my life  And I just don't know  I just don't know  How to approach it  And I want to get help 
[03:34:00]  But I just  I just don't  I just don't know  How do I approach it  To explain to my family  That you know  I've had this  This pill addiction  For probably  Five to seven years now  Well Ryan  There's a couple of ways  You could either give  A worse scenario  First  Like you could walk up  To them and say  Look  I've been molesting  Children  And they'll go  What  And you go  Nah I'm just kidding  But I have been  Doing pills  And they go  Oh thank god  It's only pills  Or  What you could do  Is weigh the options  Like  What is your family 
[03:34:30]  Going to think  If you're arrested  Buying oxycodone  What are they going to think  If you are driving  Under the influence  And you kill somebody  Or what are they going to think  See the ways  They could find out  Are all much worse  Than you confessing to them  You saying to your family  Look I have a problem  This is what I've been doing  And I need rehab  Is the best case scenario  Of ways they could find out  My suggestion would be  Like I know it's really hard 
[03:35:00]  To talk about this stuff  And  But your health  Is at stake  There's no way  You're as good a family man  Doing this stuff  As you will be  When you're not doing it  There's no way  First of all  You're throwing all that money  That should be going  Into your family  Away on it  So  I don't know your wife  Obviously  But I would suggest  Very strongly  Going to rehab  Because the most important thing  Is you not doing  Those drugs  It's more important  Than anything  Is you stopping  Where you are  Right now 
[03:35:30]  And taking steps  That's going to save your life  Because honestly dude  There's nothing more important  Than you sobering up  And if they leave you for it  Well they would have left you anyway  If they found out  Is he still here?  Oh right  Like let's say  You get arrested with oxycodone  Or  They find it in your pocket  Or there's some way  They find it  They're going to know anyway  And wouldn't you rather  Have them know  Saying look  I'm sick  I can't stop  Maybe you want to try 
[03:36:00]  A few NA meetings first  Maybe you can go talk  To a couple of people  In Narcotics Anonymous  Or another program  If you find one  And see what they have to say  And maybe have one of them  Sit down with you  And give you a little  One on one advice too  Like get to know you  A little better than I can  In a minute on the phone  I struggle with the idea  Of just  You know  I guess because I've been  Addicted to them for so long  I struggle with the idea  Of how am I going to  Even go through  Day to day life  Without being high  You can do it  You can do it  And what's happening  Is the sick part of us 
[03:36:30]  Gives us reasons  Why we can't give it up  Realize that you saying  I can't tell my family  Is just the addict side  Of you  Giving you an excuse  To keep doing it  Like  If telling your family  Would enable you  To do a lot more drugs  Easier  The addict side  Would be saying  I gotta tell my family  It's anything to keep  The addiction going  The sick part of us  And that's all it is  I just rationalize it  In my head  Sure  Keep ignoring the problem  Just to keep getting high 
[03:37:00]  Yes  And I definitely  Understand that  And it's something  We all do man  It's a common thing  Like I've never met you  And I know that  It's because we all do it  So just understand  That your best methods  Your best thinking  Got you right where  You are right now  I would just suggest  Going to a 12 step group  Talking to a couple  Of people there  And one of them  Will sit down with you  And maybe help you  Work out a way  That you can work this  Into your family  And maybe go to a rehab  But you gotta be willing  And you gotta take  The first step dude  It's kind of like  Apex tech  You have to take  The first step  Alright 
[03:37:30]  I appreciate it  But yeah  Touch back on  And let us know  How you're doing  But honestly man  You should do it  Because it gets better  Beyond where you ever  Think it can get better  Everything I have  Is because I'm sober  Everything I have gotten  Is because I'm sober  Thanks buddy  Alright good luck my friend  Oh yeah  Alright let's go to  Jeff  Jeff  Hey Jimmy  How you doing  I'm good Jeff  How are you  Oh I've been better  I've had a lovely fever 
[03:38:00]  For the last three days  And just got a card  From the love of my life  It was a handwritten  Christmas card  Which I've never got before  And she's totally gone  With some other guy  And I just don't know  What to do  Wait so she wrote you  A Christmas card  And told you  I'm leaving you  In a Christmas card  No no no  She just  She knows that  She's loved my life  But she's just  Always been away  Like she's just  Been a friend  And I've been  Friend zone for forever 
[03:38:30]  And never  Never got through it  Okay you're the guy friend  Yes  Yeah dude  How long have you been  Friends with her  Almost 12 years  You know one of my girlfriends  And I know that this is  A torture that men deal with  Being the guy friend stinks  I was in love with  A friend of mine  And I finally told her  Did this girl know  That you love her  Yes  See I finally told this girl  In an email  Only because I didn't want 
[03:39:00]  I wasn't afraid to say it to her  But I didn't want her  To feel uncomfortable  I wanted her to have  Her own space  And her own energy  And she said  Look I don't feel that way  Your past is too scary to me  And blah blah blah  So I said okay  And I just kind of  Stopped being friends with her  Not angrily  Not fuck you bitch  But this is hurting me too much  There was one point  Where I went to LA  And I came back  And she's like  How long have you been back for  I'm like six months  And she's like  You didn't call me  And I'm like well no  Because we wound up dating 
[03:39:30]  For a year and a half  And we broke up  And you know what  Staying friends  I'm glad I dated her in hindsight  But it would have been okay  If we just stayed friends too  Sometimes you gotta realize  That you're idealizing somebody  Because you don't have them  And once you're in a relationship  All the shit that happens  In a relationship  That's bad with other girls  Can happen with this one too  Like sometimes we build  These other people up  In our heads so much  Because deep down  We know they're inaccessible  So they can become 
[03:40:00]  This ongoing fucking fantasy  This ongoing goal to reach  This goal to achieve  But once you achieve it  You realize  Oh it's the same thing  I still want to fuck other girls  Or I still want to do this  Or she still nags me  To go see her family  And I don't want to  Or I still have to  Bitch at her to do this  It's the same as  Every other girlfriend  So my suggestion would be  Not angrily  Not be a dick about it  But maybe spend a lot less time  With this girl  Or cut her out of your life  Because it's just  Too uncomfortable 
[03:40:30]  And why would you  Put yourself through that?  Yeah  I hear we're going there  Like we did  We did hook up a little bit  And I feel shitty about it  Because I was cheating  On my friend  Because he was in Iraq  So there's lots of  Other things  That are  Wait  He was dating  She was dating your friend?  And she  Well  Kind of  I mean they were  Kind of dating  He was kind of  Fucking everything  He could come into  Because he was in Iraq  Sure  But he's a scumbag too 
[03:41:00]  Like we're both  Shitty people  And I get that  I wouldn't say  You're shitty people  Do we all do  Dick things  When it comes  You know  What's the expression  50 bad men  Can't ruin one good woman  But one bad woman  Can ruin 50 good men  The things that we do  And I'm not blaming women  It's our own weakness  But any woman  Can make most men  Act like completely  Get assholes for the sex  So  Yeah  Don't  You shouldn't do it  Never to your friends 
[03:41:30]  Ever  But you know  Don't shoot yourself over it  No I'm not  I'm not gonna do anything bad  But we talked about it  Like I told my friend  When I came home  Oh okay  This is what happened  And I'm sorry  And like we're still friends  Because  I'm not that shitty person  That's gonna hide it  And try to avoid it  But you know  I had to tell my friend  That I did this horrible thing to him  And  That's why we're still friends  Well  So what is your thing  With this girl  What is it you want to happen  When I first met her 
[03:42:00]  It was that  Stupid storybook  Love thing  Where  I didn't meet her  For a reason  But I did  And it was  I fell in love immediately  You know  She's  I live in Pittsburgh  She lives in  In Brooklyn  And  Like we  We definitely have  Like a love thing  But it's now  You know  It's one of those things  Where all I want to do is  You know  I realize I'm not gonna be with her  But I want her to be protected  And this scares me  When you see 
[03:42:30]  Shitty stuff  Like what happens in Connecticut  And all that stuff  But like  Well  Unless she's six years old  I wouldn't worry about her  Being shot in a first grade classroom  Yeah  You know  Honestly dude  You can't  You can't look at that  And then look at  I want to protect her  Because something bad  Might happen to her  I mean 9-11 affected  People like that  Let me ask you a question  Do you jerk off  Thinking about her  Never  See  That's exactly  You're in the exact same boat  That I was in  It's an  You're idealizing her  To me 
[03:43:00]  I'm not saying  You should only look at women  That you're jerking off  But if you're not  You're not looking at her  As a complete person  You're looking at her  As this  This rescue  From your emotional state  Or this  High  This  Again  This amazing fantasy goal  But how are you not  Jerking off  To her  Like literally  If you're that into a girl  You should be  I could  I could  Like  I've actually found  This video  That has a girl  That looks exactly like her  And it fucking creeped me out  Because  The guy looked 
[03:43:30]  Kind of like my friend  But it wasn't him  Because I asked him  And  It just  It was  A lot of things  That I was able to  I was  Because I was able  To put somewhere else  Right  And I was able to hide it  And  Because it was  Because  I wasn't raised  I'm super religious  But I was raised up  To be a decent person  Yeah  And so I was afraid  To jerk off to chicks  That I know about  I also think  That's a separation  Of love and sex  Where  Girls I love  I love 
[03:44:00]  And I want to hold  And kiss them on the cheek  And be angelic with  And then girls I want to fuck  Are different  There's a really weird  Love and sex separation  You know  They call it  Like the Madonna whore thing  Which men have  And I don't think  Women necessarily have  That  I think men do  My suggestion would be  Since she knows  How you feel  And she's not  Reciprocating those feelings  To maybe detach  With love  For a while  But there's no reason  To be hanging out  With somebody  That you're looking 
[03:44:30]  At the relationship  Different  Me and Bob Kelly  Hang out  And I'm not in love  With Bob Kelly  So his love for his wife  Doesn't threaten me  I love big tits too  But I mean  That's not what it's about  Well Bob's more to me  Than just big tits  It's the bald head  It's the accent  It's the juicy  Samoan lips  Alright well thank you  For the call brother  I would just suggest  Sparing yourself  And detaching with love  And don't be angry about it  And don't make a big deal  About it  Just kind of drift away  And let her do her thing  Alright thank you Jimmy 
[03:45:00]  Love you buddy  Alright good luck my friend  Alright see  What  Oh yeah  We have a  This is a really weird email  I got  And I wasn't going to  Read this one  But this guy's kind of  Like he says  He says look  The holidays are almost here  Don't wait  I mean  I want to get a gift  For the woman in my life  And it's got to be  A great gift  And I'm like most guys  You know I have no clue  What to get  And dude  Here's my suggestion  I would say

[03:47:30]  Look I just got a phone  With my email  I'm so happy  So it's funny  You have a phone  So I would say  On the phone  Dial 888  I hate Stephen Singer  And online  Is I hate Stephen Singer  Dot com  That's my answer  To your question  This guy's name  Is Bill  Right outside of Philly  That was a good improv  On the name  Jim  So we have any more calls  Travis  That's great advice  Yeah yeah yeah  I just wanted to go to an email  And break it up  Go back to calls  Yeah go back to calls  How about Matt in Arizona  Oh Matt in AZ 
[03:48:00]  I was just in AZ  Doing a private party  Sorry that's all about me  Hi Matt  How you doing  Welcome aboard  Thank you  I've always had  This dream about being  A stand up comic  Any advice  How I could get started  With something like that  How old a guy are you  22  Perfect  I started when I was 21  Here's my answer  I've gotten a lot of emails  About this too  Here's my answer  I would suggest  Write down  Everything you think  Is funny 
[03:48:30]  Write it down  Maybe it won't be  As funny next week  But put it on paper  Get yourself a little body  Of things you can look at  And work on  Find an open mic  And go on stage  We're going to hang up on you  Just because your phone  Is really bad  But please listen to the  I'm not cutting you off  But your phone is a little bit  You have a lot of air  Coming over the line there  But Matt in Arizona  And to all you  Aspiring comedians  I would suggest  Write down the things  You think are funny  And it's about establishing  A relationship with the audience  Like we're all funny  With our friends 
[03:49:00]  Because we have private  Inside jokes  Like Sal will walk in  And I'll just go  Hey look at this  Pepete haired douche  And we laugh  Because that's a private joke  Between me and Sal  Sal laughs  He smiles  So how do you establish  That relationship  With strangers  Who are in the audience  How do you immediately  Make them want to listen to you  That's something you learn  By going on stage  One of the greatest gifts  I got as a comedian  When I started  Was this middle act  I've never seen her since  Her name was Lynn Vecchio 
[03:49:30]  And I've tried to find her  To thank her  Because I had never done stand up  And I said to her  I asked advice  And she stood there  And talked to me  For a half hour  And she was the middle act  Either for Quentin Higgs  Or Otto and George  And she just talked to me  And she listened to me  And she made me realize  That I had to go up  And actually try it  To try it  There's no other way  And I love that  I want to do something  For this woman so bad  Because I never ever forgot  That time she took  To talk to me  So I would suggest 
[03:50:00]  Getting on stage  Don't keep stand up  As a secret dream  For yourself  Sometimes we don't try things  Because we're afraid  That if we try them  And fail  We're not afraid of failing  We're afraid of losing  That little secret place  That we can go to  You know what I mean  That little secret  Fantasy you have for yourself  Whether it's being a comedian  Or being whatever it is  And trying and failing  Means the loss  Of that secret place  Which is the  Heartbreaking part of it  So my friend  Try it  A few times 
[03:50:30]  If you suck at it  You'll know you suck at it  What did Wayne Gretzky say  You miss 100%  Of the shots  That you don't take  And I just did  That hockey analogy  Because well  That's the only thing  Hockey fans are going to hear  This year  That's going to make them happy  And I'm not a Wayne Gretzky guy  But that's a brilliant quote  And by the way  I'll be on  Love You Mean It  With Whitney Cummings  Tonight at 1030 on E  I just thought it's a horror  How great is that  After a brilliant  Wayne Gretzky quote 
[03:51:00]  I make it about me  So good luck Matt  But try it  Whoever's next Travis  Ryan in California  This is the  Two out of three calls  Have been from Ryan  That means nothing  Hi Ryan  Hey Jan  Just had a question  Sure  I've never negotiated  Or picked up  You know  A hooker  And I know you have  Massive amounts of experience  I do  Yeah  Can you just maybe  Walk through things  To be aware of  Good tactics  I don't know  I just  I'm thinking about doing it 
[03:51:30]  And I don't want to get  Screwed over  Rolled  Whatever  Well now  Do you want to do it  Because the game has changed  A lot since I started  For me it was always  Street girls  So I would ride around  And I would kind of know  That they were hookers  Now you want to do it  In the street  Or do you want to call  On a computer  Or how do you want to do it  No there aren't any  Street projects  Where I'm at  So it's going to be more  Through kind of an online thing  I would suggest  What you do is  You google the phone number  First of all  Get the phone number  Google it  And you see if they have  A lot of other ads 
[03:52:00]  In other places  As different names  It might be an agency  Who will bait and switch you  But if you see them  Coming up  In  The same place  As the same girl  Then it might be  Legit  Then you might want to  Go to the  Eroticreview.com  I've plugged that site  And see if they have  A review online  And see what other people  Are saying about them  You have to pay for it  But it's worth it  Because if you see them  All getting good reviews  That means that  They're probably legit  And don't try to  Discuss details on the phone  Because they're not  Going to talk to you 
[03:52:30]  About details on the phone  Okay  But I would suggest  Joining the  Eroticreview.com  And looking around  On like  Eros Guide  And just try to  Cross reference a little bit  That's the one advantage  To computers  You can cross reference  It's the one thing  Did I talk about this  Last week  The CIA and the FBI  Do not cross reference  And had they cross reference  We probably would not  Have had a 9-11  So that's what we can learn  From 9-11  When you're going to go out  And get blown  Cross reference  Alright my friend  Great  Thanks Dan  Good luck buddy  Bye 
[03:53:00]  Art in Pennsylvania  Oh my favorite place  To go to look at  Wordplay jokes  I hope that Matt  In Arizona  See that's something  I would write down  Talk to a guy named  Art in Pennsylvania  I said what are you  Hanging on the wall  Or something  Hello  Hello Arthur  Hey  I don't like your drinking  Arthur  I have a great experience  With this  But I wanted to ask you  What your reaction was  To when  You went to Brazil  And you said  You took a 100 milligram  Viagra  Yes  I had experience 
[03:53:30]  With taking a  Took 30 milligrams  Of Cialis  And after sex all night  I wanted to fuck  My aluminum siding  In the morning  Yes  But I was just  Curious  Of how  How did you behave  With 100 milligrams  Of Viagra  Which I can't even believe  Oh I thought you were  Actually going to ask me  About an aluminum siding  Question  A tip  Homemaking tips  I would always say  Fuck the doily first  Once your cock is used  To the doily  You're roughing it up  No  Well it's different dude 
[03:54:00]  Cialis and Viagra  Are different  I believe  20 or 30 milligrams  Of Cialis  Equals 100 milligrams  Of Viagra  I don't think  There's any such thing  As a 100 milligram  Pill of Cialis  Or Levitra  So again  Ask your doctor  About that  Like I did  But I took 100 milligrams  Because I'm an addict  So I  You know  I probably could have  Got by on 25 or 50  But me and Keith Robinson  Were taking them  And you know  I just remember  Me and Patrice  Looking at our  Fucking heart ons 
[03:54:30]  My heart on  With my robe on  Tenting  And just laughing  Like children  At where we were  We're both there  Naked  This giant black guy  And me  Our dumb bare legs  Are showing  Our dumb comedian legs  And my  We both have wristbands  On our left wrist  Girls are treating us  Much sexier  Than they should have  And we're looking  At my fucking  The outline of my penis  In my robe  Giggling like  Fucking eight year olds  So be careful  With that stuff  Though dude  You don't want  To overuse it  Take a 25 milligram  You probably don't 
[03:55:00]  Need a hundred  Milligrams dude  I was just curious  Of what you behave like  Because I know  When I took that 30  It was  That was the first time  My girlfriend said  Enough  We're done  I can't do this anymore  I just  It was like  Yeah I finally  Wore her out  Finally  But  It becomes uncomfortable  It's hard to cum  You have to jerk off  Too hard and too long  To cum  So yeah  I wouldn't  Recommend against it  It's not needed  Take a lesser dose  And just enjoy it  Your dick doesn't  Have to be 
[03:55:30]  You know  So hard  That you never cum  You know  That's a  A man addict  Type of  Thing  Yeah  It is kind of  An addicting thing  I will admit that  But it was  It was  It was  It was  An interesting event  And when  When I heard about  The hundred  I just had to ask  And I was just like  That's just crazy  It was ridiculous  But it's a different  Milligram  So thank you my friend  Alright  Be cool  Yes  Ian in Utah  Oh hello Ian  Good morning Jimmy  How are you doing this morning 
[03:56:00]  I'm fine thank you  I've been eating carrots  Well you'd be able to see  In the dark  That's right  Ever see a rabbit  With glasses  Take us out then  Go ahead  I used to love that joke  You know a joke  I used to love  When I was a kid  What's invisible  And smells like carrots  Bunny farts  That joke always makes me laugh  Because little bunny farts  Go ahead sir  Hey  I was referencing back  To one of your  Earlier callers  The sex does get better  After I got kids too  And my  My youngest now  Is 10  And my wife 
[03:56:30]  Has opened up  This whole new  Sexual side tour  Oh okay  And it's  And I mean  It's good  I mean  She's really  Experimenting a lot  Actually talking about  Bringing other people  Into the bedroom  I mean  Kind of  Kind of crazy like that  A guy or a girl  We're both  She doesn't care  Yeah both  She just  Really just kind of  Opened up  That's great  She was really  Really conserved before  So yeah it is  It's really  It's really good  But we're going on a cruise  And me  Oh cool  Drive 
[03:57:00]  I've never really been  One to take like  Drugs or anything like that  But she's really  Lately wanted to try  And  What kind of drugs  She wants to try  Ecstasy  Honestly dude  I mean like  You know  Once you have kids  That's usually the time  To start experimenting  With fucking hard drugs  We wanted to wait  Until we had children  And then we began  Tying off and  Booting heroin  With our patient friends  You know  I don't know enough  About ecstasy  To be honest  I've never done it  I don't know how  Addicting it is 
[03:57:30]  It's like  Look if you're  Experimenting  And she's being  Dirty and open  It could be  Great sex  But I've heard  The come down  From ecstasy  Is fucking horrifying  So it's almost like  You're experimenting  With this stuff  And you're being  Dirty  Why chance it  Like why chance  Fucking up  This great new  Place you are  Sexually  By doing a  Really hard drug  I wouldn't  Recommend it  Maybe you smoke  A little grass  And fucking  Try to eat  Each other's  Genitals  With cotton mouth 
[03:58:00]  And then you laugh  At how terrible  You are at it  I don't know  Enough about ecstasy  Talk to people  Who've done it  Buddy  I've never done it  Okay yeah  And I wasn't sure  And I've read that  Too  And that it gets  Addicting  And that's why  My question was  If it was  One of those things  Where once you have it  Then that's  You always have to be  At that level  In order to  You know  Have any kind of  Good time  Right you don't  Want to do that  Because look where  You are right now  You're both branching  Out into other areas  Like hey let's  Have other people come in  Maybe we'll fuck in the end  When you're in that  When you're in that  Let's try to keep  This going  Thing  You don't want to 
[03:58:30]  Start upping it  Because once you  Get to a level  It's hard to go back  To the lower level  Like if you bring  A person in  I had a couple  Threesomes with a couple  Girls I dated  And I've never watched  A girl fuck a guy  But I had one girl  And I would just  We would see this  Other couple  And I would just  Watch her suck  The guy's dick  And then the other  Girl would suck my dick  But I was glad  That we didn't move  To sex  Like maybe you start  With oral sex  Or something like that  Where if it's  Uncomfortable  You haven't gone  All the way  Like you know what I mean  Ease into that shit dude  Because once you see it  You can't unsee it  Right 
[03:59:00]  And be careful with the ecstasy  I would always say  Be careful of hard drugs  You got kids  You don't need to be  Doing fucking ecstasy dude  Just tie each other up  Let her put on a strap on  Fuck you in the ass  Spit on you  You'll laugh about it later  While you're having your  Sanker in the morning  I'd rather take ecstasy  You and me both  Thanks Jimmy  Be good buddy  Henry in Pennsylvania  Oh hello Henry  Oh Jimmy  Henry  Hi buddy  You've traipsed  All over the world 
[03:59:30]  And you've obviously  Been a connoisseur  With women of the night  So I was just wondering  Where are you  And you know  Patrice  Where you guys  Have had the best experience  And you know  What were the best ones  With the highest grades  I like the fact  That you pluralized  The wrong person  Women of the night  Like I'm fucking  King Arthur's chicks  Yes  I'm eating their smelly pussies  As they wipe their hands  On dogs  Because napkins  Haven't been invented yet  Brazil  Honestly Brazil  Is the only place  We travel to  Outside of the country  But I would say  That my 
[04:00:00]  Best hooker experiences  Have been in New York  I mean  Because the variety here  Has been so good  My experiences  Have been so many  But the only place  We travel to  Like Patrice and Keith  And Bobby  Went to Amsterdam  I never did Amsterdam  Patrice went to England  I don't know if he got  Hookers there  So  And he went to Brazil  With his girlfriend  For me  The only out of country  Traveling with friends  Hooker experience  I had was in Brazil  So I'd have to say  There  But here  Are the homegrown ones  I don't like the lack  Of language communication  I like the communication  I like being able to talk 
[04:00:30]  Because half what makes us dirty  Is the mental  The exchange between each other  I don't like thinking  Someone's doing it  Because their children  Are starving  That turns me off  Because I'm a piece of shit  But I'm not a predator  I don't like predatory things  I don't like fucking  Honestly  Kids  I don't like innocence  I like fucking dirtbags  Who are very aware  Of how dirty they're being  So  I need  I need the commonality  Of language  Yeah down the hole  Looking to go deeper  Yeah  Exactly 
[04:01:00]  I don't even know what that means  I just said exactly  You're my king  And I just wanted to say thanks  Because you know  You guys have been great  To give me so many laughs  Over the years  So  I might not get to talk to you again  Over Christmas time  So  I just want to say thanks  And you guys are the best  You're my king Jimmy  Thank you  That's very nice  And you probably will not be  It's safe to say  You won't be talking to me  Over the Christmas time  Since we've never met  I don't see us  I don't see us  Christmasing together  Well if I don't see you  At the holidays  You won't  No thanks for the comment  I appreciate it  I love you Jim  This is great  Take care buddy 
[04:01:30]  Kyle in Alabama  Hi Kyle  Hi Jim  How you doing buddy  Alright  One of my good friends  We were in each other's wedding  And over the past year and a half  Two years  It's kind of  We don't hang out anymore  And it's really  Honestly  And I think we  We would both agree  It's because of his wife  He's kind of got a whole new  Yeah  The whole new set of friends  The whole new  He's done it to other people  There's a couple of my buddies  That still hang out with him 
[04:02:00]  But it's kind of  He's kind of traded it in  I guess my question is  Do I just kind of  Let it run its course  Like it has  The past 69 months  Or I just feel like  I need to say something  Or it's going to kind of  Stay with me a little bit  But I don't want to get to  Where I'm criticizing his wife  Yes  It's a deluxe situation  So I appreciate  Any kind of advice  You would have  You can't come between  Him and his wife  Maybe you talk to him  You might say something like  So hey  Hey let me be married  He'll probably go  That's alright  And you could go like  Never think of having her killed 
[04:02:30]  You know  But if you don't want to go that route  You could say something like  You know  Hey man  I feel like we don't hang out as much  You know  Hey look  I don't want to be a pussy about it  But I kind of miss seeing you  Maybe leave his wife out of it  Because you never  Want to pit yourself  Against his wife  Because in fairness  He should choose her  Because he's married to her  Obviously there's something about her  He likes or loves  Because he married her  So maybe she's being cunty  And judgmental on his friends  Or maybe he's just enjoying her more 
[04:03:00]  I don't know  Here's the one  Sorry Stephanie  Here's the one thing  That is kind of confusing  On my part  Is they're hanging out  In groups of  You know  Five or six or whatever  They go do different things  And what not  But two of the guys  That they hang out with  Or that are in this  Quote new circle  Or guys she banged  In college  Oof  Now  That's where I get to where  You know  And believe me  This is not going to  You know  I have a lot of friends  I have a good time  I have a wife  And I have a kid 
[04:03:30]  That's not a problem  But that's where I'm thinking  If there's something about me  I guess  But if he can hang around  With guys that she banged  In college  Then I'm just really  Blown away  Of what it could possibly be  I don't know  Who knows what  Excuse me  Maybe he's just enjoying them more  Not to be a dick to you  But maybe he's enjoying them more  In this period of his life  How's that not being a dick to me  What's that?  How's that not being a dick to me?  No but I mean  I'm saying like  I'm not trying to 
[04:04:00]  You know  I know  Literally that might be it  Maybe he's just enjoying them more  Or  Maybe those are her friends  And he's a little pussy whipped  At this point  And he's just trying to start off  On the right foot  I don't know  My suggestion would be  To talk to him  Without  Bringing her into it  He knows  What conversations  He and his wife have  You're not going to say  Hey I think your wife  Is saying something  And he's going  Oh my god you're right  She did say that to me  Last night after we fucked  He's privy to those conversations 
[04:04:30]  And you're not  So if you say  We're not hanging out as much  He will absolutely know  Whether or not  His wife has been influencing that  So don't put that on him  Do not  Pit yourself  Between him and his wife  Because he will choose her  I would just say  Come to him honestly  Say hey brother  I miss seeing you  Or maybe you don't have to use  Hulk Hogan lingo  Like I did  But you know  Then you fucking  Leg slam him on the floor  Whatever the fuck 
[04:05:00]  That dumb finishing move  Or maybe like Hulk Hogan  You can have sex with his wife  While he films it  From the fucking  From the handy cam  In the fucking ceiling fan  But I would talk to him  Without at all accusing her  Alright  Alright man  I appreciate it  I'm going to try to make up  Nashville to see you  Good luck my friend  I would hope so  And listen  We're out of time  I wish we weren't  We started a couple minutes late  But we got the reads  Out of the way right  No good  I got one  What do you mean one more  I haven't done one yet  Oh my  Oh god  Is this the same one  No 
[04:05:30]  Oh it's a different email  Hold on  Oh  Here it is  Okay  This guy threatened me  He got to call me up  He goes  This is it  You have no time left  And uh  I wrote back  I said  What do you mean dude  He goes  You have to get the woman  In your life a gift today  Or else  Apparently  This guy is afraid  That I have a woman  In my life  Who I'm not going to get  A gift for  And he wants me dead  And uh  I said  Well I don't know  What you mean 
[04:06:00]  And he goes  You want it to be  A great gift  And so I wrote  I don't know  What the answer is dude  And he writes back  The answer is easy  Steven Singer  So of course  I write back  Why  This was a really long  Gmail exchange  He says to me  Because if you order  From Steven Singer  Right now  You'll receive the item  Before Christmas  So I write back  Well fuck you  I'm not paying for shipping  He writes back  Fuck you  You don't have to  It's Steven Singer  I'm like  What are you talking about  He says  Steven Singer  Has free shipping
