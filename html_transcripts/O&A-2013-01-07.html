<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often shifting abruptly between them.  The overarching theme throughout much of the show was the hosts' ongoing battle to expand their studio by knocking down a wall separating them from the vacated Martha Stewart space.  They repeatedly voiced their frustration with management's inaction, employing hyperbolic threats of sledgehammers and Pink Floyd's "The Wall" to express their displeasure.  They speculated humorously on the reasons for the delay, including potential allocation of the space to other shows, particularly Shade 45 and the Morning Mashup, even creating a White House petition (with only one signature) to support their cause.  The Radio Wizard was frequently invoked in their comedic predictions regarding the wall's fate.  A SiriusXM employee, Marcelino, was brought in to provide inside gossip on Shade 45's potential move, fueling the competitive banter between the shows.  The hosts even symbolically claimed the space by placing "Future Home of the Opie and Anthony Show" signs on the door, briefly interacting with rapper Common during this action.  The show also discussed recent layoffs at the station, specifically mentioning the departure of producer John.

The movie review segment included *Taken 2*, *Zero Dark Thirty*, and a detailed, often graphic and darkly humorous discussion of the documentary *Dark Days*, focusing on the lives of people living in the NYC subway tunnels.  They also reviewed the trailer for *Green Card*, and mentioned  *Texas Chainsaw 3D* and the *Evil Dead* remake.  Gerard Depardieu's move to Russia to avoid taxes was briefly discussed.

Another significant portion focused on several high-profile rape cases: a brutal gang rape in India, and the Steubenville, Ohio rape case, with the hosts expressing strong condemnation and discussing the legal systems involved.  The hosts also spent time reminiscing about MTV's *The Real World*, specifically the first season in New York, offering detailed and often explicit recollections of the cast and events, including Dave Edwards' expulsion.  Sam Roberts was repeatedly referenced throughout various stories.

The show also featured sexually explicit conversations about Tiger Woods' ex-wife and waitresses, graphic descriptions of sexual acts, and repeated use of the N-word, sparked by a discussion of a journalist's refusal to use the word during an interview with Samuel L. Jackson about *Django Unchained*.  One host shared a personal anecdote about using the word in front of a child. The discussion about *Django Unchained* was followed by conversations about box office numbers for various films, including *The Hobbit*,  and a comparison between the film's buzz and that of *Lord of the Rings*.

Late-night television provided another major topic.  The hosts discussed the rivalry between Jay Leno and Jimmy Kimmel, Leno's interview with Kimmel,  Kimmel's success, and Letterman's perceived failings and his interview with Oprah, including his infidelity confession and feelings about not getting the *Tonight Show*. They also discussed the careers of Jimmy Fallon, Conan O'Brien, and David Letterman, including their social media engagement and perceived strengths and weaknesses.  The hosts also compared Billy Eichner's style to that of Eastside Dave, playing a clip from *Billy on the Street* featuring Will Ferrell.  A brief discussion about Al Roker and Flo Rida also occurred.

Technical difficulties with the Opie and Anthony SiriusXM website, where a video was stuck in a loading loop, led to repeated jokes about the "radio wizard" and the song "Spinning Wheel" by Blood, Sweat & Tears, leading to a discussion about the band and its legal issues.   A robot band playing Motorhead's "Ace of Spades" was described in detail, with speculation about its origins (MIT).  A sexually explicit voicemail from Steve-O was also played.  David Letterman's therapy was briefly mentioned.  The broadcast concluded with the playing of Motorhead's "Ace of Spades".


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Greg audio, Antonio, oh, fuck, weren't we just here?  This is, uh, what is this?  You know, that's, that's no way to start a radio show, by the way.  We're just here.  We do, we still do like what we do.  Yeah.  So maybe we shouldn't say that.  This is like the first Monday in a while we've been in for like the full week thing. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah.  So I was kind of dreading waking up.  Yeah.  You know, like, like we say all the time, being here is cool.  It's like, it's, it's fun and everything.  That getting up part.  Fuck me, man.  I was going through all my, uh, my go-tos.  Yeah.  I'm like, all right.  I haven't said my kid's sick in a while.  I know the flu's going around New York.  Maybe I could hit that one up for today.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's me.  It's not feeling good.  Maybe I could go with a personal issue. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  Occasionally you got to kiss management's ass and do a full week.  Yeah.  Just suck it up.  Suck it up.  Do the full fucking week.  I, I say we don't do a full week unless they promise that they're going to take this wall  down.  I know.  That's what I say today.  We really need.  Are they still working on it, Sam?  Yeah.  Because we're going to obsess about this one.  Oh boy.  Just like we did the coat hanger, the thing that was hanging down, the fucking lights, our new  one, our new obsession.  Is to take this wall down behind me and move into the Martha Stewart old studio. 
[00:01:30]  Have both the studios, the old Martha Stewart one and this one together as one studio.  You know what we should do if they say no, dude, man?  You know what we should do?  I'll come in with a sledgehammer.  Fucking.  But how about we play the wall by Pink Floyd over and over?  The non-stop man until they stop us.  Can't stop us, Matt.  Lock the studio door.  Call the cops because we're not leaving.  And we have these tickets to give away.  Yeah.  We're not leaving radio bits. 
[00:02:00]  You do realize the general manager at any time could have turned off the fucking channel,  right?  Hit the power.  Yeah.  And we told you Martha Stewart wouldn't work.  Finally, it's happening.  We told them a year ago to get rid of that dumb channel.  Yeah.  But I guess some good guys lost their jobs, huh?  Yeah, apparently.  Yet Sam Roberts continues to draw a check, albeit a menial one.  Yeah.  But just hanging around like a cockroach.  Right?  E-Rock, who do we lose over there?  You know this shit.  Not weight. 
[00:02:30]  All right.  Early.  Oh, E-Rock, is that your weight?  6'17"?  The guy who actually used to work at NEW was the producer for the morning show over there.  John?  John, yeah.  He's a really good guy.  Someone hire him.  Is he out of work?  Yeah, they all got severance package and they've all been, they were let go right before Christmas.  John Constantine.  Yes.  Oh, shit.  You remember John?  He's a good guy.  Oh, man. 
[00:03:00]  Okay, now I know who you're talking about.  Fuck yeah, I like John.  Very good guy.  And then, any other good guys or was he it?  No, that was it.  He's like one of the only people I know around here.  There was nobody in that studio after the morning show.  So, all right.  John was good.  Are you helping us trying to get this wall down?  Yeah, I brought it up and to some people, this was like the first that they've heard of it.  What are you talking about?  But I thought we, but I thought last week when we talked to him.  Well, that's when it was.  And then.  Yeah.  So, what's the status? 
[00:03:30]  They're looking into it.  Oh, boy.  I would assume so.  Nobody's told us anything different.  Shouldn't that be a no-brainer considering we've been bitching probably, well, since we  started radio together in 1994.  Yeah.  But, I mean, we've been bitching about this tiny studio ever since we got here.  Yeah.  And we said we want a bigger studio.  So, now the opportunity is upon us where all they have to do is knock this wall down.  Let's put it this way.  The Berlin Wall came down faster.  Yeah.  I do believe we're on equal footing.  We got the sledgehammers. 
[00:04:00]  You know, we could do the same thing, too.  We could spray paint it.  No, we could knock the wall down.  We'll autograph pieces of the wall and give it to our listeners.  We ought to spray paint it to look like the fucking Berlin Wall.  Yeah.  Give me some spray paint.  I'll do it right now.  I wouldn't doubt it.  I'll do it right now.  It wouldn't surprise me if they knocked the wall down but then didn't knock any of that  stuff and just gave us a little corridor into the next studio.  Yeah, because they would do something yet completely fuck it up.  They always had an excuse why they couldn't, but now it's perfect.  Yeah.  There's no more show there. 
[00:04:30]  They just knocked this wall down.  We got a huge space.  We could start inviting the listeners up for the live shows again because we like doing  that.  Fucking cool with that.  It would bring a whole new energy that we kind of miss.  Little bleachers set up like over there.  Yeah, but you know what?  What?  They might have to drill a couple new holes in the table, so I don't know.  Yeah, they're against that.  Remember how against drilling holes in this console they've been?  I do remember that.  They do it in a bathroom stall so often.  Yeah, the drill bit's dull.  There's a giant board in front of me and they don't want to move it because it'll... 
[00:05:00]  Don't say that about me.  It's giant.  I'm boring.  I know.  We got it.  Don't worry.  We got it.  And they won't move this.  No.  For what reason?  You don't need this anymore.  Because you committed three and a half years ago or whatever it was to that being the spot  and at that point it became a life decision.  Things don't change.  No.  But it would give me so much more table room, which I desperately need. 
[00:05:30]  So you have to break it and then we'll just get you a new one.  Wait, I see the problem.  What?  It's all the way back to where that mic is.  Right.  And in order to move the board back...  They're going to have to move the fucking mic hole.  Which means...  But then the board will be hiding the mic hole.  No, it's just drilling the hole.  They don't want to do that.  The action of creating...  It's crazy.  Why don't they want to drill a hole in those?  I don't know.  It's been an issue every time we brought up the mic.  Oh, well, we can't be drilling a hole in the board in the console. 
[00:06:00]  Such an ugly color.  Is this day three or day four of Remove the Wall?  Get Troy on it.  Get Troy on it.  We need production.  The Iranian hostage crisis.  Day 300.  Troy's not here today.  So I can't.  You know that...  What's the home show on ABC?  Move That Bus.  We want to do Move That Wall.  Move That Wall.  Come on.  We should be able to fucking...  Do you want to try that studio out since nobody's using it?  No.  I want to see the sun every morning.  That would be nice. 
[00:06:30]  You can...  Ooh.  Well, that studio overlooks Manhattan.  Yeah.  The west side of Manhattan.  I know the sun rises from the east, so I'm going to save you the trouble.  But I'm just saying, if you could look out a window, you could kind of feel the sun  coming up.  In Manhattan, it reflects off everything.  There you go.  Everything's bright and shiny.  You could look over the Hudson River and Jersey.  Jersey.  All right.  Day four, I guess.  Let's make it day four of Move That Wall.  We're on day four of Move That Wall.  And they're just working on it right now? 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  I mean, in the meantime, they're going to be using that studio for people to do interviews  and stuff like that.  When does the Radio Wizard get in?  9.45 just in time to go over a couple things as we're running toward the elevators?  That's about right, right?  Yeah.  As long as he's here by the end of the show.  All right.  So as soon as he shows up, I want you to march down that hall.  And we want an update on the Move That Wall.  Mr. Greenstein, tear down this wall.  Yes.  What are the odds we get that done?  Zero to zero.  A fucking billion, trillion.  All right.  But who are they going to move in there? 
[00:07:30]  We'll make a deal where people could use part of our space.  Oh, nice.  Part of our space.  Partitioned curtain up.  Yes.  Yes.  I don't think they should use any of it.  I don't think they should use any of our space.  You know what?  No.  I'm with Jim Norris.  Nonski.  Deal off.  Deal off.  Nonski.  Deal off.  No reason for them to use our space.  Nonski.  I was just trying to be nice.  They weren't using it when it was the Martha Stewart.  Yeah, they were.  The studio weather?  Yeah.  During the day?  Uh-huh.  What was I trying to say?  They have to go somewhere else.  Yeah.  Logically, who else would need that studio space? 
[00:08:00]  Who would they move in there?  Who would they move in there?  Sam Roberts?  Huh?  Whenever they have interviews in here, people just record in whatever studios are available.  Right.  So, Iraq, who would need that studio?  Who would they move up that's in a tiny little studio?  Somewhere.  Oh.  Name one show that I know of around here.  The mashup need a new studio.  They can't be sitting in Cousin Bruce's place anymore.  Right?  If we lose out to the mashup.  Holy fuck!  I swear to God.  I'm going to start petitioning for the mashup just so I can see the battle take place.  No way.  No.  No way. 
[00:08:30]  No.  A nice bigger studio for the mashup.  I will chop Nicole's feet off and beat the staff with her feet.  Nice.  Oh.  It's cruel.  Yeah.  Those giant fucking pets.  Exactly.  You can hit one with the toe, one with the bunion.  One with the heel.  Big, long fucking medieval feet.  Clown foot.  These are hammerhead.  Remodeled the studio.  Yeah.  Our hammerhead toe.  Never mind.  Fuck.  It was a little too long.  That's like the toe.  Hammerhead.  You have to add toe or it doesn't fucking make sense to anybody. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, man.  Take note.  Broad Dog may or may not be getting a new morning show, so you'd have to have a studio for them.  No.  No.  No.  No.  This should be the opportunity they've been waiting for.  Hey, ONA.  Wouldn't it be nice if they approached us?  We don't even think about it.  And they came up and said, guys, let's float this past you.  Martha Stewart is gone, right?  We're like, what?  What happened?  Oh, what?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Martha Stewart's gone.  But we'd like to know, would you guys be into knocking down that wall in there and we give 
[00:09:30]  you the big studio you've been asking about since you've gotten here?  What?  How nice would that be?  You would want to work for a company like that.  Yes.  That's the type of little things.  But that's the type of little things that really make you want to, you know, come to  work.  You got a little skip in your step.  Like, wow, they're just so, they're so caring.  It would make me think that they did mean it over the years, but didn't logistically have  the studio.  But now the second it became available, and we didn't even know, they told us, like,  the second it happened.  Oh, Martha Stewart's gone, what? 
[00:10:00]  Right.  And then take the wall down.  Of course, we have to chase him down.  Of course, the radio wizard, it wasn't even a thought in his head.  It wasn't a thought in Blatter's head.  It wasn't a thought in Greenstein's head.  Even though we've been saying it over and over again for three straight years, probably  three and a half years.  Plus, when you brought it up, the look on the face was kind of like, yeah, that's fucking  ridiculous.  That ain't ever happening.  That isn't ever happening.  Why would it be ridiculous?  Because it would have to be a thing that's happening.  You do realize there's only four shows here that people know about, and the rest of it 
[00:10:30]  is just garbage, right?  They do know that.  Yeah.  I mean, four is a lot.  It's Howard.  It's Oz.  Mad Dog.  Maybe Mad Dog.  Maybe Mad Dog.  How many shows are live here, by the way, also?  How many live shows broadcast in the morning?  In the morning?  It's you guys, Howard.  Morning Mashup.  I mean, Morning Mashup for three hours.  The Al Q guys.  Al Q and Raw Dog.  And Raw Dog.  Great.  And all these other studios.  And Morning Mashup. 
[00:11:00]  But anyone can do the Morning Mashup show, because that's just playing the hits.  Yeah, that's true.  And Sway comes in at 8.  I don't know if that's technically.  How many start a morning show at 8 a.m.?  Well, Opie, come on.  And we want to start a little later.  They said no.  No.  So we need a black audience, and then we can start at 8.  Yes.  I guess they think Shade 45's audience tunes in a little later.  Maybe a little later than we start broadcasting.  Wow, that's a stereotype.  But aren't there plenty of other studios available then for other people to record things?  Like, everyone else has a studio. 
[00:11:30]  In the morning?  Yeah.  Yeah, there's space.  So there's only four go-to shows on this whole platform in the morning?  That's it.  Yeah.  So I was right.  I just pulled that number out of my ass.  That's garbage.  And the rest of them really is garbage.  So what exactly is it to do here?  So why wouldn't they want to make one of the four shows happier?  Or happy?  Let's start with happy.  Happy.  Yes.  I guess because there's so many garbage shows that even the few good shows, they're like, 
[00:12:00]  well, we'll just treat them all like garbage.  But they're not going to move a garbage show into that space, are they?  It's prime real estate around here.  Right.  It is.  But then again, maybe they will give it to us.  Oh, Jimmy.  Maybe they've been in talks to say.  That's what makes you a funny comedian.  Maybe.  Norton.  Maybe they've been in talks to kind of knock the wall down.  Oh.  Oh, Jimmy Norton.  That's rich.  No.  Just take it out.  Take that fucking little E-Rock booth out. 
[00:12:30]  And then we slam that somewhere like out of the way and have all this center area, all this  area to just look and go, now, what do we want to do with it?  Let's put a console here.  Let's put a live studio audience area here.  A performance area for bands and whatnot.  It's much too much.  It stinks when we have a band in here plugging in, and they're a foot from us, and there's  no room.  And they're sitting on a couch rocking it.  They can't even bring the drums in, so they usually tap on the garbage can or a bongo or 
[00:13:00]  something.  Or even when there's just a guest, and somebody from the web team comes down to video, and  I video, all of a sudden we're on top of each other because there's two cameras.  That camera can't move because it's in the way.  There are times I'm close to pissing my pants because I know I can't leave my area because  it's too crowded.  And there was a time when Ant would put his foot down and say, I don't want people behind  me.  Yeah.  He knows he doesn't have that luxury in here anymore.  I don't have the luxury anymore.  No.  They've cut a little notch out.  I'm amazed they did that when we first got here. 
[00:13:30]  They were not happy about that.  So I could fit into the console.  That took months, by the way.  They really weren't happy about doing that.  No.  They were not happy.  But I had literally two feet with me included in it.  They care so much about, they call it furniture.  They care so much about it, but they picked the worst color ever.  I don't even know what this is.  It just comes in a shape, and then you go, well, can we?  Know what this is?  They go, what?  Know what this is?  This is the cheapest color available that was sitting around some warehouse somewhere. 
[00:14:00]  And they went, well, we do have this color.  We got plenty of the speckled burgundy.  You want speckled burgundy?  Is it burgundy?  I don't know.  I think it is like a burgundy.  I wish I could take a picture of this, but as soon as it's tweeted, the color will look  completely different on Twitter.  Believe me, it's terrible.  It is a weird color.  Somebody was pissed at somebody for ordering something.  Why would you order that much of that fucking color?  Why would anybody want that?  No one's going to want it.  No, they got a really good deal in this color.  I'll tell you why.  It's very obvious.  I'm going to take a picture of it.  I think I can get one that's fairly accurate. 
[00:14:30]  And I'll tell you why they have this color.  It's because they anticipate employees killing themselves and it will blend right into this.  Right.  The blood and brain matter.  So move that wall.  Right.  Radio Wizard, when he gets here around 945, ask him, what's the status?  945.  You know what?  I was going to say what he was going to say, but I don't want him to be on to me.  So I'm going to write it down.  Write it down.  I love the write down.  I'm going to write it down.  We have it in our head, and when they come in and say it, we chuckle. 
[00:15:00]  We also chuckle.  Anybody else want in on this?  What is the Radio Wizard going to say about moving the wall?  Yes.  All right.  Write something down.  Let me think.  First of all, all right, I want to write it down, but.  No, no, no, hold on.  Here, write yours here.  Okay.  So it's on the same page.  All right.  Hold on.  Anybody think I'll have a confirmed date? 
[00:15:30]  Maybe.  The wall is coming down.  Okay, here's mine.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I know you sort of went for the joke, but.  Oh, but it's too true.  To be honest with you, there's a very good possibility that is what it's.  Oh, God, I hope not.  Jesus Christ.  Look, if you've got garbage shows, leave them where they are.  Make the one show that people do know about. 
[00:16:00]  One of the four in mornings, anyway.  And four, by the way, four is generous for mornings.  You think?  I think so.  If you're just saying mornings.  How cute guys, they got their audience.  It's a show that caters to the gays.  I guess we got gay people listening to us, too.  We got one at the end here.  Right.  I meant you, Sam.  Damn it.  And then it's us, Howard, and who else?  Who's the fourth show again?  That's why I'm saying you're being generous.  Morning mashup?  No, because anyone could do that.  I mean.  No offense to those guys, because they're good broadcasters.  They'll probably move on eventually to. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, I hope that isn't it, Jimmy.  I think that's what it is.  What?  What did Jimmy write?  I'm reading, Jimmy.  We're giving Martha's studio to the after show and Sam.  No.  Sam's going to have it.  I will.  Should be.  All right.  I will.  Should be.  There's our answers.  They're safe.  They're safe.  They really are.  They're safe going on.  Wow.  Shit.  How do you say his name?  Gerard Depardieu.  Depardieu.  Is a fat fuck.  He is.  But let me tell you something.  We haven't seen him in years in America. 
[00:17:00]  I guess he's a big international movie star.  But we only see him every once in a while in America.  He's decided, fuck France.  I'm moving to Russia.  You know something?  There's a celebrity, though.  We've had a lot of celebrities here in this country that, for political reasons and whatnot,  have always threatened, if this one wins or if this bill passes or if this happens,  I'm leaving America.  I'm going to pick a place.  Right.  And they never leave.  I mean, what's his name?  Fucking Alec Baldwin's a prime example.  He does that from time to time.  But Gerard Depardieu, they decided they were going to raise the taxes to 75% for his income 
[00:17:30]  bracket.  I think they finally did decide against it, but all the wheels were already in motion.  Well, what percentage are they paying now?  Probably a fuckload still.  Well, obviously.  But if they turn down 75%, it's got to be close to 75%.  Yeah, it's got to be.  It's got to be at least 60, 65.  I bet it.  I bet.  Wow.  We're heading that direction.  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  A progressive tax system.  We now have the most progressive tax system.  It's like you're bragging about that. 
[00:18:00]  You fucking socialist.  That's what they call it?  Yeah.  That's so the people that make a little pay a smaller percentage than the people that  make a lot.  They pay a bigger percentage.  Meanwhile, a percentage is more money for someone that makes more money.  So it equals out anyway.  You're still paying more money.  We now have the most progressive taxes.  So Gerard Depardieu decided, fuck this.  I'm going to Russia.  So there he was, putting on the Russian garb, doing the Russian dance with Putin.  He's fucking happy.  He's pigging shit right there.  They're welcoming him there.  Yes. 
[00:18:30]  Is there a smaller Pardieu under his coat?  I know.  Yeah.  It just keeps getting smaller and smaller.  Oh, like the Russian doll?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then the one we remember from the first movie he made.  Oh, there he is.  Oh, okay.  He pops out.  Yeah.  I guess he's a big star.  I mean, we know him from Fried Green Tomatoes.  He's a huge international movie star.  He was in another movie.  Doesn't do as well in America.  From time to time, they throw him in a movie here in America.  It does well, but.  What else was he in?  I mean, he was in.  The only thing I know him from is my father, the hero.  My father, the hero. 
[00:19:00]  He was in that movie with the kids, Tango and.  Yes.  Fuck.  Get his Wikipedia up there.  Get that fucking shit up there.  What the hell?  Rio.  Blame it on Rio, I think.  Wasn't he the father?  Was he the father in Blame it on Rio?  No.  Oh, then who was the father in Blame it on Rio?  Michael Caine and Joseph Bologna.  And Dice was in that.  He was in Cyrano.  De Bergerac.  He was in Man in the Iron Mask. 
[00:19:30]  No.  What was his big film that everyone remembers?  Man in the Iron Mask is big.  The early one.  The first one he did.  Yeah, thank you.  Go way back, motherfucker.  I thought it was in the 80s.  Was he not in Fried Green Tomatoes or no?  I don't think he was.  What was his big movie?  Oh, those are all French.  Go to his first American one.  Yeah, you went into the French section.  Oh, gee, Sam.  French cinema stinks.  Green card.  Green card.  I had green, right? 
[00:20:00]  Green card was the one where people went.  He's carting away fucking.  Who is that?  That model broad.  Andy McDowell.  Right, Andy McDowell.  Ground hog.  He was the leading guy.  Do we have a moment of that?  I don't remember what his voice sounds like.  Can we find it?  Is there like a 10-second clip we can play?  It sounds like, wah-ha.  Wah-ha.  From Green Card?  Yeah.  How sick of hearing Fried Green Tomatoes was everybody?  I just kept saying it.  Yes, you did.  It's like we heard you.  It's wrong.  So is he really going to live in Russia?  Yeah, that's it. 
[00:20:30]  He's kind of a photo op.  No, he did it.  Is there good places to live in Russia?  Oh.  We don't know much about Russia, do we?  We really don't.  Is mauve the color of this console?  Mauve?  I don't know.  And then there's mauve.  Mauve could be close.  All right, here's the trailer.  Yeah, a trailer for Green Card.  All right.  All right.  Let's hear a little...  It's a huge movie.  What year was this?  1990.  90?  That's right.  I thought it was earlier.  He did something in the 80s.  Child of the 80s.  Yeah, I remember like...  The idiot or the fucking something. 
[00:21:00]  The dolt.  I remember being in high school and I took a date to see this.  Oh.  It's Green Card?  Yep.  Oh, wow.  Child of the 80s, baby.  Child of the 80s.  Yep.  Yep.  I was in my late teens, I'll admit it.  I can't see it.  Thanks.  You're together?  Sort of.  Do you mind?  Good talking.  You're like an old married couple.  Are you married to us?  Not usually.  Whatever do you mean? 
[00:21:30]  Well, not normally.  You're getting divorced?  Yes, definitely.  From Peter Weir, the director of Dead Poets Society, comes the story of two total strangers  who entered into a marriage of convenience.  I now pronounce you man and wife.  Bronte, is this true?  Yes, but it's not the way you think.  Uh-oh.  They thought they'd never have to see each other again.  Oh, it's for the Green Card.  I'm with the investigation department of the INS.  Oh, shit!  What? 
[00:22:00]  The Immigration Service.  The government changed everything.  I hope there's no spoilers in this.  Let him move into my apartment.  I can't believe you're saying that.  But if marrying a stranger doesn't shock you...  Look at that guy.  ...and letting spend a couple of nights sleeping on the sofa, no lecture can shock you either.  You don't know anything.  Oh.  I bet at the end they turn out to love each other, right?  No.  What?  ...illegal aliens marrying for residency status.  Let me do the talking.  No, I'll do the talking.  How did you two meet?  We thought of Kravitz.  Kravitz?  Into each other.  Get that story straight.  Mom.  Dad. 
[00:22:30]  What's going on?  What is that?  This is George.  The handyman.  You hereby swear that the evidence you're about to give is the truth?  Oh, my God.  This sounds thrilling.  A refugee.  Is this an action movie?  This is horrible.  I'm your husband.  Yeah.  Trailers haven't changed in years.  It's got the No Country for Old Men haircut.  That's where they got it from.  France's most acclaimed actor, Gerard Depardieu.  Really?  And America's newest film sensation, Andy McDowell.  Newest film sensation? 
[00:23:00]  Two very different people sharing one very unusual relationship.  This ain't no Groundhog's Day.  She hasn't aged either.  No.  It's creepy.  Yeah, she looks the same in those makeup.  She just kept her shit together, man.  It's nice to see a frump like him, though, getting leading man roles.  Green card.  I bet at the end they fucking realize that they actually are in love.  Holy fuck.  Hollywood wouldn't do that.  Yeah.  Well, they don't.  At the end, what happens is it goes through.  They can get married. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  And before he leaves, he says, I want to feel the snugness of her back door.  And he mushes her face into the afghan and puts it in her hiney.  Did you see Girl with the Dragon Tattoo?  No.  I just saw that over the weekend.  The daughter of the giant's owner or something is fucking great.  Yeah.  And there's a scene where she is brutally ass fucked.  Wow.  It's a good movie.  Did she enjoy it?  No.  No.  She reacted like any of us would have. 
[00:24:00]  Kicking an ouch.  Wow.  A lot of ouches.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Wow.  Oh, I took in a little film this weekend also on pay-per-view.  Uh-oh.  Taken 2.  Oh, you went?  Really?  It's on.  Yes.  Really?  On demand.  You didn't like the first one, right?  No, I thought the first one was ridiculous, just like we all did.  No, not all.  Oh, really?  I was all in.  You were all in?  I mean, there were some problems with the movie, but I loved the action scenes.  Well, if you thought there were problems with that first one, the second one is so utterly 
[00:24:30]  bad.  Really?  It's so bad.  Were the action scenes good, at least?  Ah.  Ah.  Taken had some good action scenes.  Yeah.  There's a chase scene where the daughter is now driving and the father's in the passenger  seat, like, shooting because they're being chased.  Right.  But it's the same dialogue during the entire chase.  He just keeps going, go, go faster, go faster.  And she's like, I can't do this.  Yes, you can.  Because she doesn't have her license. 
[00:25:00]  See, at the beginning, he picks her up so she can take her practice for her road test.  Right.  She can't even parallel park.  But now she's going through these little Budapest streets.  But now she's out driving the bad guys.  Yeah.  She's shifting.  She's doing those things where you're going in reverse, and they go, and now you're going  forward.  Oh, she's doing all that.  Yeah.  But you couldn't parallel park and begin the movie.  Well, the movie starts with him lying on a table while people sit around and dip their  California roll in his hair.  Yeah, how was that hair?  All I was thinking, very soy sauce. 
[00:25:30]  Very soy saucy hair he had.  I mean, the first one, I didn't mind.  The storyline was a little stupid, but I love the action scenes.  Where he's like, he's taken.  Him and his wife are taken.  Oh, and wait, they're the ones that are?  Yes, and now the daughter's out, and she's trying to help.  So he has the daughter to try to locate where he is.  He has the daughter throwing hand grenades around like turkey.  Like she's on rooftops, and she just lobs a grenade, and you hear, boom! 
[00:26:00]  And then he's like, one, two, three, boom!  And he hears the boom, so he's able to tell how far away.  Oh, God.  It's so impossible.  That's what we think of turkey, by the way.  Yeah, just lob grenades around, we don't give a fuck.  It doesn't even matter what you throw.  Nah.  How far away?  I don't care about those people.  Was it the same daughter?  Yes.  Okay.  Yes, and she did run a little at the beginning, and I got a little chuckle.  Is she the one that came in?  Yeah.  Oh, cool.  She's fucking hot, man.  She's beautiful, man.  She's really cute.  We all kind of like...  Yeah. 
[00:26:30]  Got a little...  She's really cute.  A little plump.  What's her name?  Interviewing her.  She was...  Maggie Grace.  Maggie Grace.  Oh, yeah.  I follow her on the Twitter.  I got vibes from her.  Did you?  No.  Yeah, she was pretty fucking hot, but the movie's utterly ridiculous.  Did you watch the whole thing?  Yeah.  Watched the whole thing.  Fucking beginning credits, dang credits, my friend, and it stunk.  It stunk up.  Big one.  And then I saw Zero Dark Thirty.  Ooh, how was that? 
[00:27:00]  Pretty fucking good.  I hear it's good.  But you know what?  You saw it, right, Jim?  Loved it, yeah.  You loved it?  I know it's not an action movie, but it does get a little long-winded in the analytical  portion of what's going on from the beginning.  I did like the torture scenes.  Those were fucking great.  I mean, I fucking...  Is it bad that I thoroughly enjoyed, even though it's a movie and they're actors, that  that might have fucking happened?  No, it probably did happen. 
[00:27:30]  I loved it.  It probably happened just like that.  That's why the CIA's getting involved with that movie.  I love it because you break, everyone breaks, because it's biology.  That was a great line.  It's like fucking, you can't, you know, hey, I'd love to tell you, you might fucking sweat  it out, but nah, the human body just can't fucking deal with this shit.  I didn't mind the slower, like, investigative parts, because to me, they were telling a true  story.  Right.  That's what I hated about Ben Affleck's movie, which I loved until they actioned it up.  It was ridiculous.  And they didn't need to action it up.  I liked it a lot.  I did like it a lot. 
[00:28:00]  But it just, yeah, there was, it was one point where I was kind of like, oh, okay.  Then they got me back.  And then, of course, the end where they, they actually go in.  To the raid, yeah.  And the, the scene, um, where the one soldier turns to the other and he's just looking at  him and goes, do you realize what you just did?  Like, the guy doesn't even realize, like, they're just all, all wound up for a mission.  It's like, dude, you just did it.  You just shot the guy.  And they're saying it's pretty accurate to what actually happened, right?  I gather.  That's why the government's getting involved.  Yeah.  Pretty cool.  Well, the guy got, we were supposed to interview the guy and, uh, the Pentagon's suing him 
[00:28:30]  for his book.  So now he's not doing any, uh, and he couldn't do any press.  The, the, the, uh, seal that wrote the book.  Right.  I loved it.  I thought it was great.  It was good.  I liked it.  The girl was good who starred in it.  Uh, cause he credited her anyway.  She was legitimately the one who got, uh, bin Laden.  Mm-hmm.  I love Gandolfini's little fucking thing as Panetta.  Ah, it was great.  The theater I went to was fucking nice.  They served, um, uh, like, uh, vodka, orange juice, and, um, cranberry.  Nice.  Yeah.  In the theater?  Yep.  It was the best fucking theater I've ever been to. 
[00:29:00]  And all you had to do was like press a button and the movie stops so you could take a piss  and not miss a fucking, was it packed though?  Weren't the rest of the people pissed when you would think a movie theater like that would  be packed?  Uh, because how many people were in there?  I think it was only like one?  Yeah.  One person?  Just me.  Wow.  And considering the price, you'd think the price to go into a movie like that would be 
[00:29:30]  very expensive?  Very reasonable.  Wow.  Very.  Cheaper than a normal movie ticket.  The price to that theater was your soul.  Very good.  I, uh, I saw a movie too, which is very rare.  It's our movie break.  Ooh.  I saw, and it turns out, I think Sam saw the same movie and we didn't have it planned  out.  Was it animated opening?  No.  Did it have songs and dancing crabs?  Oh God, no.  No more.  Did it have cars with colors on them?  Oh God, no. 
[00:30:00]  My kid is into Spongebob though, thank God.  Oh.  He said, fuck Caillou.  Caillou.  Although every once in a while he tries to go back to the Caillou and I throw on Nickelodeon  because they just have Spongebob marathons around the clock.  They know it.  And then he's into the Spongebob.  I'm like, thank God.  Can he watch more than one Spongebob episode in a row?  Or like more than one Caillou episode in a row?  I could put on the same, uh, Spongebob episode all day long and he has no idea it's the same  one.  I don't get it.  They don't.  He's not at that stage where he goes, I've seen this already.  Yeah.  Hey Pop, what the fuck? 
[00:30:30]  Look at that yellow fucking thing moving around.  This is great.  Yeah.  That's all it is.  Yellow.  It's moving.  It's cool.  Sound.  Sound coming out.  Yeah.  His new thing is stop talking.  Holy shit.  He's heard the audience.  Stop talking.  Oh, wonderful.  But I saw Dark Days.  Oh, yeah.  I was watching it.  I know.  What is that?  I found out through Jess.  Oh, I was about to say.  That you were seeing Dark Days as well. 
[00:31:00]  Dark Days is a documentary they did on the mole people.  Back in 2000.  I thought it was in the 90s this movie came out, but it was 2000 about the people that  live underground in that same tunnel that I just did a video about recently.  And that's why I went and said, you know what?  I got to go see Dark Days again.  The movie's on Netflix, and it was really cool watching it after your YouTube video.  Yeah.  Because your video was what it really looks like.  And so you could actually put it in context of where it was. 
[00:31:30]  Because my favorite was the guy who was down there, and he was talking about how he was  a hustler.  Yeah.  Except he just sold garbage.  Yeah.  He's like, I'm about to get up there and make that money.  I sell VCR.  Works like new.  I sell it.  I make money.  And that's why I thought the movie was from the late 80s, early 90s.  Because he's selling the VCR.  Then it turns out it's 2000.  But he did have some CDs at one point.  Right.  Because I'm going to my guy in the Bronx on 185th Street.  Was it crowded down there?  Like, were there a lot of...  Like, the one you showed, it was pretty clear. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, no, no.  They cleared everyone out.  And this movie, it was around the time they were clearing everyone out.  They got rid of him in the 90s.  And this movie was released in 2000.  And there was an update.  So it looks like the movie went back a few years.  So I'm thinking they filmed around 95, 96-ish.  Maybe.  Then had an update.  And then released a thing in about 2000.  They only focused on about maybe a dozen people.  Maybe a dozen people.  So it was all right. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  Just I.  I think the filmmaker had a great opportunity there.  And I think, I don't know, I think it could have been a lot better, to be honest with you.  But it was still cool as hell.  Because these people were living the fuck down there.  Is there any documentary or shit from when that was really crazy down there?  There is a book called Mole People I read that gives a better idea of what it's all about.  Because everyone has the impression that it's like a fucking sci-fi movie or one of those future movies where people are just relegated to the tunnels. 
[00:33:00]  Well, the people they were interviewing were down there five, six years.  But they were talking about other people that had been living down there for decades.  Jesus.  So they were living there in the 70s when this movie was filmed.  Like they've been down there 20 years.  They would show older people every once in a while.  But obviously they're probably too far gone or crazy that they didn't actually interview.  But they would show them in front of their little shanty and, you know, showering and stuff.  That must have been like fucking crazy ass crime rape down there.  Well, they all were crackheads. 
[00:33:30]  Most of them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was funny watching like because they show people smoking crack.  But then they also did interviews with people who are obviously fucked up.  But there was like one guy who was like trying to not seem fucked up for the interview.  Oh, yeah.  And he was like, like the guy next to him said something like about dragons or something like ridiculous.  And he hit him while he was doing the interview.  Hey, I'm trying to fucking present an image here.  There are some bedbugs down there, you think?  Bedbugs.  They showed rats in between every scene, basically. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, man.  They wanted to make it perfectly clear there's a lot of rats down there.  Because that was their B-roll shot or whatever.  They would show rats and then move on.  A transition shot or a rat shot, I should say.  Were they freaked out by the rats being around them?  No, they laughed at them.  And they figured out ways to keep them out of their little areas.  How would they do that?  They built some impressive space down there.  How would they keep a rat away from them?  They would just try to plug up all the holes and whatnot.  And a couple people had dogs to chase the rats away.  One guy had four dogs and they all, like, were underfed. 
[00:34:30]  That was depressing to see.  It's like Terminator.  Like the people that had to live underground with the dogs and the fucking...  And then one guy, he was so sick of people banging on his little living area asking for crack that he took paint and wrote no crack on the front of his makeshift house.  That's great.  He said he stopped doing crack, and so he needed everybody to stop coming in and doing crack or asking him for crack in his house.  Right.  That crack really fucking did some shit.  I just wish they had more shots of the actual, like, community down there. 
[00:35:00]  They only focused on some people and where they lived.  That's what bothered me.  And also how they got in and out and what their days consisted of when they were above ground.  They showed a little of that, but it was always close-ups of them just going through garbage.  Rambling and garbage picking?  No, just going through garbage.  And it wasn't a lot of wide shots.  Not a lot of wide shots.  That's what drove me nuts.  It's like you could see their spaces, but you couldn't really tell how close they were to each other.  Yeah, you couldn't get a feel for how many homes were down there.  That's weird. 
[00:35:30]  You think they did that to kind of falsely present an image?  I don't know.  I just think the guy had a great subject for a documentary, and I think it fell short, to be honest with you.  A lot of people praised this movie.  It was good, but I don't know.  I liked that the one guy, the guy who had the crack sign, all he did all day, every day, was work on his, quote, house.  He just worked on his house every day.  That's good.  He's putting some sweat equity into that thing.  I know he'd take out the window.  But these guys...  He's a regular Bob Vila of the fucking scums. 
[00:36:00]  But they figured out how to shower down there.  They broke some pipes, so there was just water constantly pouring out.  But you would have to take a freezing cold shower, but they did.  But then they had one guy with an electric shaver.  They figured out how to plug it to the electricity.  They had cable TV down there on these shitty black and white TVs.  Legal?  The guy with the shaver was great, because he was the same guy who was talking about how he was a hustler.  I'm a hustler.  That's what I am.  I'm a hustler.  Because he's selling VCRs.  VCRs.  He was like, I'll put down here five years of my life, because, I mean, you ain't got to worry about anything. 
[00:36:30]  I'm shaving.  I got power.  Con Ed's not sending me any bills.  Motherfucker.  He wins.  He goes, why would I live up above ground?  I don't know why.  He's got electricity, a TV, an electric shaver.  Maybe so you're not next to the fucking guy with no crack on his door and rats running around.  What kind of health insurance do they have down there or medical care?  And then he's getting money.  Oh, you just remind me of something and just fucking hit something. 
[00:37:00]  He's a hustler.  But, yeah, it's not glamorous.  Like, there was the one guy who his security system would put a frying pan on a pencil and attach it to some string.  Right.  So that way, when somebody walks by, they trip over it and the frying pan makes a noise.  Because he has to wake up in the middle of the night any time anybody walks by.  But it's better than being stabbed in the middle of the night.  That's good.  Does he get a call from the main office?  We've noticed your frying pan went off.  Oh, you're okay.  Do you need help?  Your frying pan. 
[00:37:30]  They seem relatively happy down there.  Ah, there was something I want to mention that I can't remember.  I guess compared to living in a park where it's fucking freezing, that's a big step up.  No, they said, why, you know, if we go above ground, are they going to throw us in a shelter or something?  And that shit is scary.  Because I guess you get all your stuff, you know, stolen.  You get beat up a lot.  Shelters and movies look pretty cool.  It's like a family that fell through the cracks.  And they're there.  And, you know, it's not the best things.  But through their love and companionship, they make it through.  Oh, that's right. 
[00:38:00]  It's a bunch of people that should be in mental hospitals.  What was the violence like down there?  Was it, like, less than you'd think?  See, this is all the stuff they didn't really get into.  I have no idea.  This guy stinks.  I know.  I have no idea.  I mean, it's a whole community where they lived there easily in the 70s all the way until this movie was made around late 90s.  And you have no idea of any of that stuff.  No clue.  I wonder if...  How many people, you know, die?  How many people are actually living down there?  Because there's been rumors that it's been, you know, tens of thousands to, you know, hundreds. 
[00:38:30]  The guy had a great opportunity.  I'm sorry.  He fucking missed out.  You think some people just bury people down there when they died?  I'm sure.  You just dig a hole and bury them?  Like, ah, that's it.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Never to be found again.  And, like, it was in black and white, which I get stylistically.  Oh, that's right.  That was, like, that was forced.  Right.  I felt like, oh, God, really?  You didn't need to make it black and white because, you know, if you filmed in color, it would look so gritty.  Because they couldn't really get a great light source down there. 
[00:39:00]  And the whole point is people want to see what it looks like, right?  Yeah.  Like, that's one of the main points.  I felt the same way about Birth of a Nation.  I thought, nice.  Black and white.  Using black and white, that was kind of hack, I thought.  Like, really?  You went with the black and white?  Gritty man.  Right.  You didn't have to do that.  We all, when you saw the rats, you could tell it was gritty.  Did that have anything to do with the lighting, though?  Do you think?  Could black and white be shot at the lower light?  And they'd go up on the street and they'd still be a black and white.  I think, you know, in all fairness, we should probably try to book the guy for a quick interview. 
[00:39:30]  I bet you, you know, in all fairness, that he used black and white because he didn't have a big budget.  Is there a big money difference in the film?  No, I'm sure.  Yeah.  Especially back then.  If it's on film, it's a huge difference.  That's why Clerks was black and white.  So maybe that's why.  Maybe he went black and white because he didn't have a lot of money and then realized, wait,  black and white would work in this situation.  I just thought it was kind of, I don't know, forced.  Yeah, it would have been cool.  Just do it on video.  Think there's a lot of oral sex down there? 
[00:40:00]  Fucking cheapo.  That's what someone told me about my video.  I said, watch out.  A lot of guys go down there to get blowjobs.  No, but I mean mole people that eat each other's assholes and pussies.  Like in a tent.  Like with a frying pan outside of security.  You're all sitting on your face.  Well, there was one black girl that loves smoking the crack.  Oh my God.  She didn't mind me in film doing it either.  And she got mad because the one guy who kind of cared about her, a white dude, is like,  when are you going to stop?  And I'll stop when I'm ready. 
[00:40:30]  I got bronchitis.  I'll stop when I'm ready.  I thought someone was barbecuing.  And she goes, and who are you?  And he goes, I don't smoke crack anymore because he was a big crackhead.  Yeah.  You still smoke the pot?  That's a drug as well.  The pot?  So leave me alone.  Wait, nobody got time for that?  Oh, man.  Got time for that?  She had the biggest mouth and the biggest lips I've ever seen in my life.  Oh, my goodness.  I'm just saying.  Of course.  I know. 
[00:41:00]  You got pictures of these brugs.  You got a trailer for Dark Days.  Anything?  Well, that'd be a good idea.  It was a good movie, but...  A little feel for that?  It's too bad that he didn't give an overall picture of the whole...  The history of it, even.  The history was kind of...  It came down in the tunnel.  It looked dangerous, man.  It looked real dangerous.  Because even in the daytime, it was dark.  And, like, I was scared.  Won some awards, though. 
[00:41:30]  I said, somewhere down the line...  That's the hustle.  It can't be bad as it is.  It won the...  Oh, man.  Yeah, the police messing with you.  Where the fuck are they going?  There ain't nobody can walk by you while you're sleeping on the bridge and bust you in the head.  I'm sorry.  I would never go and put it like that.  Because ain't nobody in their right mind going to come down there.  So you ain't got to worry about nobody coming down there messing with you.  But they're not.  They ain't going to be too scared to come in there.  No one messes with you.  The only thing you've got to worry about is dying. 
[00:42:00]  If that happens, you don't know anyway.  I went online to try to get updates on some of these people they feature in the movie.  And there's no updates.  So I don't think that's...  I don't think that's good.  Probably not, no.  But it's called Dark Days.  It's on Netflix.  It's worth checking out.  Yeah.  Don't do say so.  This is that guy hustling and talking about how he doesn't have to pay Con Ed.  And he's living large.  Look at that.  And he's got a piece of...  He's naked.  And he's got a piece of glass that he's holding up for a mirror.  That's all, like, sharp and everything.  That's what you need, though.  Go judge him, fucking Sam. 
[00:42:30]  Judge the guy.  I'm saying, he's getting money.  Oh!  He doesn't have to pay Con Ed.  Yeah, motherfucker.  That guy, I think he was the one who said...  He goes, you see that?  I forgot what make a car he said.  But I think he said something like, that's my Cadillac.  And it's a shopping cart.  He goes, that's as valuable as a Cadillac.  A Cadillac.  He didn't say Cadillac, though.  What did he say?  Fucking Mercedes or something?  I can't remember, but he had, like, a fuck.  Whatever.  He had a few shopping carts, and they were all with stuff tied into him.  Right.  And he said, you know what that is?  Money.  Money. 
[00:43:00]  Money.  This guy's a hustler, man.  That's more valuable than a Mercedes.  Yeah.  His bed was very messy, though.  I was looking at that in the back while he shaved.  Yeah.  What a messy little area.  I hope he doesn't have any bed bugs or anything like that.  Oh, I bet he does.  That's what would drive me crazy is the bugs.  You think there's ever roaches down there?  Oh, my God.  You must get so used to it.  Yes.  Was the one guy eating a rat?  Oh, God.  I don't know.  They made it.  I don't know why they wouldn't just say, but he was basically saying how delicious this 
[00:43:30]  thing he was eating, and the other guy was disgusted, and then he was talking about how  he spiced it all up and made it taste good.  I spiced it up.  This am delectable.  This am delectable.  And then they had some cutaways to rats, so I think they were trying to tell you that  he was eating rat, but they didn't want to say it was a rat for whatever reason.  Have yourself a drumstick.  This shit ratches.  Look at that mess he lives in.  Oh, God.  He's just bragging about the whole thing.  Hey!  How about you straight up?  You got camera people coming in.  Well, straight up. 
[00:44:00]  He was the messy guy.  There was another guy that was, like Sam said, constantly working on his shit, and even  would sweep the floor.  Wow.  He was the guy who used to be a crack addict, and you could tell the only thing keeping  him off crack was constantly working on his house.  Right, right.  If he stopped for a second, he'd have that pipe back in his mouth.  You know the crack fucked up something in his brain, where now he's...  Just OCD sweeping guy instead of crack.  Wow.  I've seen this.  I have seen this.  We went when we were at NEW to a small, weird, out-of-the-way theater downtown. 
[00:44:30]  I don't even remember where to see this.  And it was a narrow theater, I remember, in black and white.  It was a cool experience.  Fucking Soundgarden.  Oh, that guy on the right was fucking downright scary.  These were the guys that were all fucked up, and the guy with the beard, with the gnarly  teeth, was just saying nonsense.  And I think he's either a black or a Hispanic guy with a mustache.  He was, like, hitting him and being...  Except he was fucked up, too, obviously.  Are you saying that fucking...  Oh, my God.  Richard Dreyfuss was talking, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was telling him to shut up. 
[00:45:00]  The guy on the left, for whatever reason, had a pile of pictures of all his old pets.  That's what he was...  And he was talking about every pet, and how much he loved his pet, and then would tell  you how the fucking pet tragically died.  Holy fuck.  Is that a stereo behind them?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  And it works.  It's got a big speaker and stereo system.  That's a neat house, at least.  They figured out how to plug in down there.  Yeah, but they probably are able to...  But why wouldn't they show where they plugged in?  That must have been just a fire trap waiting to happen. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, man.  I bet.  It needed more, like, the narrators.  There was no narrator.  The guy who made it to have a voice in it.  Like, it was literally just the camera on these people.  Yeah, they could have used a narrator, and they certainly could have used...  Make a story out of it or something.  Yeah, I don't know.  I wonder how hard it is to get real structures down there, because the holes are so small.  How do you get...  No, there's another way in where it's wide open.  Oh.  But it's way uptown.  And they go to the fucking construction sites, I bet.  They scavenge some wood.  And they drag them down the tracks a couple miles to where they were living.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, because at the end of the film, you know, Amtrak was kicking them out. 
[00:46:00]  Sorry, spoiler alert.  And they've decided to wreck their own homes before they left.  Oh, like Little House on the Prairie when they blew up fucking the town.  I guess it was their way of, like, freeing themselves or something, so they had sledgehammers.  What do you do when you make a sandcastle at the beach and you're ready to leave?  You stomp the shit out of that.  You don't want anybody else playing with it.  You don't want anyone else enjoying your sandcastle.  I don't.  No?  Well, you don't.  I dance around it and pretend I'm the king.  Because Amtrak probably wanted a lot of those valuable properties that they had built. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And they took sledgehammers, and you saw how good these things were built because they  had a tough time knocking them down, man.  Why would they just leave them and go?  What are you doing?  Well, I don't know.  Maybe for the movie they decided, hey, we want you to destroy your home for the movie.  I'll give you 20 bucks if you bash your fucking house, then.  Here you go.  Yeah, you're right.  Let's get some real fucking action.  Basically, just bum fights.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's no reason.  So.  I bet you they're still under there somewhere in another part of town.  Oh, no, there's a lady named Brooklyn that I'm going to interview soon. 
[00:47:00]  She's a cat lady down there.  She has hundreds of cats.  Oh, she must have so many fleas on her.  Oh, God.  We were deep down the tracks in a really dark section.  And the guy who's with Moses, who's going to be on the show soon, he starts calling up  to this area that was above us.  Probably, I'm going to guess, 15 feet above us.  There was some kind of ledge.  And he was calling into the darkness for this woman.  And I'm like, because we're just kind of in the shadows.  I'm like, I don't want anyone to know we're down here. 
[00:47:30]  Who knows who the fuck is up there?  Fucking A.  And she didn't call back.  So he's like, ah, she's probably above ground right now.  But she's been living there forever.  And this guy that I was with, him and his buddies spent the night down there for her  50th birthday.  I go, tell me you didn't sleep all night.  He goes, no, I actually got a couple hours of sleep.  And I'm like, you're fucking nuts.  That's why he took me to the other place and got me to a weird fucking predicament.  I would want to, if I ever did that, I would want.  This guy's crazy, this guy. 
[00:48:00]  Take some off.  Spray yourself with off first.  I'd want one of those fucking helmets.  I'd want a helmet.  And then I'd want fucking the night vision goggles.  Yeah.  And I'd want a gun.  And I'd want Kevlar-like boots.  Yeah.  Then I might go down there.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Nah, I'd go if I was dressed like fucking Armstrong.  If I was dressed like Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, that's how I would.  I'd be fucking space kid.  I would spend the night down there.  I wouldn't sleep, though.  I wouldn't sleep a fucking wink, though. 
[00:48:30]  Like these guys.  Yeah, you know, we got drunk and stuff.  So yeah, I got a couple hours.  I'm like, no way, man.  Bugs.  I didn't see one rat.  I was on the ground for over two hours.  Tape up my pant leg on my boot.  You tape that shit up.  Yeah, sure.  Gloves, tape it.  Because I wouldn't want fucking bugs.  You get infested.  You get infested like a cooking meth on Breaking Bad.  Exactly.  Yes.  I didn't see a rat, and then it was told to me that, you know, obviously the rats go where  the people are, and there's no people down there anymore.  Aw.  People, rats need us.  They certainly do.  And when they realize that, maybe they'll be a little more cordial. 
[00:49:00]  No kidding.  There's the lady with the huge mouth and lips.  And that's the guy who loved his house.  What is she doing to him?  I think she's shaving his head.  Shaving his head.  Oh, that's nice.  She got a hair purler?  Well, she lost her home, in quotes, because she did someone wrong, so they burnt it down.  Right.  And they showed the fire department down there having to fucking deal with this fire.  Oh, man.  And then, so she moved in with this guy, who used to smoke crack, but only smokes weed now.  Right.  And he wrote, no crack on his wall. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, and he's trying to get her off the crack.  I looked at my house and said, oh, lord, it's a fire.  The fire.  She kind of said it like that.  Oh, lord, it's a fire.  She's not pretty.  No.  She could be the ugliest broad I've ever seen in my life.  She loves crack, though.  Loves it.  Loves the crack, huh?  Loves it so much.  The filmmaker had to make sure you knew that.  It's like, okay, we got it.  She likes crack.  Ooh.  There was a good shot of her off to the side watching her little home burn down.  Aw. 
[00:50:00]  She was very sad.  That's very sad for her.  She was extremely sad.  She's shaving her head, though, then?  She's got a beauty parlor for herself.  No, the guy likes the worst hairdo ever, where his whole head is shaved, but then he has  those, like, the beard that starts way up here in the side of his fucking skull.  Like by his eyebrows.  Nice.  Oh, yeah.  That guy was fucking scary.  It's Dark Days.  It's on Netflix.  He was obsessed with the houses, too, because not only was he rebuilding his house, the guy 
[00:50:30]  next to him was like, you know, I think you probably got the nicest house down here.  And he was like, no, no, no.  I don't have the nicest house down here.  You know who has the nicest house?  Oh.  So it's keeping up with the fucking Joneses down there.  Oh, man.  Who was the guy who goes, he was going to put a balcony in upstairs, decided to get a balcony?  He's a balcony guy.  He was like, he put a balcony in, he took the balcony out, he built a window, but then  he took the window out.  He's just building structures and taking them down.  And needs to build.  Keep that fucking...  He wanted a window, and then you realize if you have a window, then all the crackheads 
[00:51:00]  are going to be peeking in, seeing what they could steal from you.  And then he had to take some paint and write no crack on his door.  Because he had it.  Because a crackhead would be like, well, we're going to go...  No, it says no crack right there on the wall.  No crack.  No crack.  What are you going to do?  Oh, it's fucking that rape case.  We were watching the news.  So enraging.  Of course it is.  Five minute cases of barbaric rape.  In India.  In India, yeah.  That was the...  I read some of the details of that.  How do fucking people...  I gotta say, I think there are certain people on this planet that aren't really people. 
[00:51:30]  They should be burned alive.  There's nothing...  The thing that makes you a human, as opposed to an animal, I think it's that part of you  that has, like, compassion and fucking, like, guilt.  And, like, all those things that, like, keep you from doing bad things.  That would upset you to the point where you can't live anymore.  You know?  Like, we were talking about how people can shoot somebody.  And then just go to sleep and go and hang out with their friends the next day.  And it's like, how the fuck can you not just wake up in the middle of the night going, 
[00:52:00]  Bye!  Shot somebody!  Of course.  And then we try to save everyone.  They shouldn't be treated as humans.  They should be put down.  Put down.  The world would be a much better place if you just get rid of those fucking people.  They raped this girl brutally.  And her fucking boyfriend or something, they beat up badly.  And in this bus they were riding, they were driving for hours through the city.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And didn't they pull her intestines out or something with these bare hands, one of the  guys?  Why?  Why?  Why?  And ripped her insides out. 
[00:52:30]  Why do you need to do that?  Because you have no...  Because you're an animal.  They're just animals.  How do they handle people like that over there?  Well, there's in America, we cuddle them and we protect them.  And give them an eight to ten year fucking case.  Well, we at least give them the opportunity to excuse themselves and blame something else  other than the fact that they don't have a portion of their mind and their brain and  their soul and consciousness that stops you from doing shit like that.  Four of them are facing hanging and the one who's underage who was the most barbaric. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  Because the Indian law is only facing three years.  They have those weird juvenile laws.  Three years?  That's it over there?  That's all they can give them.  Why would they do that?  You know right away what your kid's going to be like.  This kid's not going to change.  No, that's...  He's barbaric and you should get him off the fucking planet immediately.  Yeah.  I don't give a fuck how old he is.  Disemboweling women with your bare hands.  I don't think three years is sufficient.  And they tried to back her over with the bus.  It was like one of these illegal buses where like, you know, I'm guessing it's like a  party bus here.  That's just my guess. 
[00:53:30]  Where they come out, they had seen a movie, The Life of Pi.  And they were just going home.  And I guess they saw the bus.  They, oh yeah, we can get on here.  And there was these other guys on the bus.  Fucking animals.  And the bus driver.  And one of them was a personal trainer and one of them was the bus driver's brother.  And there's just two other guys.  The bus driver got involved?  Yeah.  Well, they were probably looking for some devious shit or maybe it just happened.  But five guys, they might have raped him too.  They sexually assaulted him with a fucking crowbar too.  Jesus.  For hours.  Why the anger? 
[00:54:00]  They just, they're animals.  They're dirt bags.  Whatever happened to a little pinch on the hiney or a little, as we like to call it, the  ETs.  The old elbow titting.  The old elbow titting in a crowded fucking city.  That's just it.  You can't even say like, why would they do that?  Why?  Because they're not humans.  The whole world is fucking annoying.  And I'll tell you, Anonymous, they do some stuff that drives me nuts, but they do some  fucking stuff I love.  That school rape thing?  The school in Ohio?  Yeah.  I think these guys are getting special treatment because they were like athletes. 
[00:54:30]  Yep.  There's some alleged rape.  Oh, in Steubenville?  Yeah.  And Anonymous had enough.  Steubenville, Ohio.  That's a horrendous case as well.  What was it?  I don't know that one as well.  That video of the fucking guy.  They were bragging about it.  I saw that.  Yeah.  You just wanted to.  Did you just want to fucking kill that guy?  And I guess, what, they're star athletes, or at least one is a star athlete, so they  were trying to handle it differently.  Right.  And they got caught.  Yeah.  How'd they get caught?  Like, what weren't they doing?  Facebook or something and was just bragging.  The video that was going around. 
[00:55:00]  And what was the town doing differently?  Like, what were they not doing that they shouldn't be doing?  I think the police chief sort of was like, well, you know, these things happen.  These kids.  And the football coach was even worse.  He was saying, you know, hey, you know, if she was asleep during the whole thing, then  why is she so upset?  Like, she doesn't remember it.  Yeah.  No shit. 
[00:55:30]  Unbelievable.  Fucking assholes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fuck.  There's a website the town just put up.  Um, that's, we have that story.  They put, the town is getting so much, um, shit.  They put a town sponsored website.  Really?  Because of, uh, there's, like, thousands of people going to show up because of anonymous  organizing this.  Yeah, yeah.  Uh-huh.  Um, protest.  Fuck them.  Yeah.  They're releasing.  I love when anonymous just releases people's shit.  Like, people who should.  It's like, here's every bit of information that makes them a person in this age. 
[00:56:00]  Right.  Good for them.  Yeah.  All right, uh, we got some food in front of us.  Yes, we do.  Radio Wizard here yet?  I don't know, but there's a slight update on the wall situation.  There is.  Oh, what?  Wait, of course, it's day four of, uh, Move That Wall.  Masterful plan on Twitter.  Twittered me a link to a White House petition that has been started.  Oh, wow.  It's a White House petition.  Make the Radio Wizard remove the wall in Opie and Anthony's studio at SiriusXM to create 
[00:56:30]  more space for quality broadcasting.  Wow.  Quality broadcasting.  I hope that, uh, passes.  So far, there is one signature on the petition.  Oh, come on.  The president's not going to get involved.  Is he?  Oh, Jimmy, you don't know.  Mm-hmm.  Come on.  Let's move the wall.  It's time.  All right.  All right.  One, I have one quick question before we go.  Maybe we can talk about it when we come back, but is, is fucking, is Hogan still suing  Bubba and his wife? 
[00:57:00]  Oh, I think, uh, Sam Roberts would probably know about this.  I think, uh, he refiled, uh, a lawsuit against Gawker, who started the whole thing, right?  He refiled against Gawker.  A hundred million dollars.  He's still suing Bubba's wife, not Bubba.  Oh, Bubba's wife.  It says Heather and Bubba, but maybe that's just wrong.  Yeah.  To my knowledge, he dropped the lawsuit against Bubba.  Oh, okay.  After the apology and everything.  Okay.  But Heather.  But she seems to be the one that pushed this out there, maybe.  That's what he's accusing.  Maybe.  Because I don't know.  I don't want, I don't need to get involved with this bullshit.  Damn. 
[00:57:30]  I'll remember her from the real world.  Oh.  Right there.  She was on the real world.  Was she?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She was the first real world in New York.  First real world.  She does a show now.  The black chick.  From the real world.  Where does she do a show?  With Sway.  Sway?  I didn't know that.  She sways like sidekick?  Yeah.  She's got a couple of chicks in there.  Shouldn't she be white?  What's her name again?  Interesting.  Robin.  Heather from the real world in New York.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was the first one?  Oh, yeah.  She was in love with Larry Johnson, the basketball player.  Remember that? 
[00:58:00]  Oh, wow.  He played the Hornets.  Oh, Larry Johnson.  Yeah.  When he was a Knick, I think.  What year is that?  93?  Well, it's probably 20 years ago, at least, at this point, right?  One of those guys is a buddy of mine.  20 years ago?  Dave Edwards.  We should look into what happened 20 years ago on this show.  No, we've done that.  Oh, Jimmy.  I think they just passed the 20-year mark for this show.  Yeah.  I think it's more than 20 years.  So, I think it's about 22 at this point.  Yeah.  It was filmed in 92.  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  It was in 92.  Can I see the cast, Sam?  I can't see.  That's her.  Who else is on that fucking cast? 
[00:58:30]  Oh, there was that chick that was, like, dancing.  Oh, Eric Knees.  Eric Knees.  From The Grind.  The Grind.  He was part of that cast.  And then the gay guy, right?  Where's the gay guy?  Every real world needs a gay guy.  Oh, he wasn't gay guy.  They didn't go gay guy yet?  The guy down at the bottom in the middle, he wasn't gay guy?  I don't know.  First gay guy I really remember was Pedro.  He was a crazy liberal guy, though.  Oh, and then the guy in the upper right was musician guy?  Right.  What was the year Dave got thrown off?  Dave Edwards for looking at that girl. 
[00:59:00]  That's L.A.  Was that L.A.?  Oh, I said that was season one.  That was season two of L.A.  And Puck was season three?  Yes.  Did he just die?  He just died or no?  He's in jail.  No, Puck's in jail.  He's in jail.  He's stalking.  Puck, he got arrested for putting his fingers in the peanut butter.  I am not a man dying of AIDS.  I am a man living with AIDS.  Is he dead or alive?  He's dead.  He was by far the greatest real world character ever.  No one comes close to Puck.  Hey, Chubbs.  Remember when he called that chick Chubbs?  He goes, yeah, don't worry. 
[00:59:30]  No, Chubbs is good.  We all see it.  We all see it.  And then he got his ass kicked off the show.  They brought in some who gives a fuck.  And then they kind of brought him back.  I'm like, just keep him on the show.  He's the greatest thing you ever found.  Why did he get kicked off?  Because he was just an asshole.  He's an asshole to everybody.  That one chick in the middle, the white one.  Yeah.  She had a hot body on her.  Yeah.  Remember they showed her a dance class or something?  She was doing like hip-hop dance and shit.  I don't remember this real world that much.  I started watching with the second season.  I watched that one. 
[01:00:00]  I watched that motherfucker.  And then I was all in for a while.  I was all in up until Boston.  I remember watching with my lovely wife.  Oh, she was in town?  I watched this season, yes.  I tapped out after Boston.  Wow, you don't even do a radio yet.  No.  Wow.  No, I was a bum.  Like I am now, anyway.  Yeah, I was working.  I remember going home and fucking making me some drinks so I could take my marriage.  And then watching The Real World.  Real World Marathon.  Marathon.  We're great.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I never watched a full episode of Real World. 
[01:00:30]  It was great.  Back then it was good.  Now it's like cast, like fucking Laguna Beach.  Yeah, I can't.  POC.  Can you imagine there was a time on reality shows when Puck's sticking his fingers in peanut  butter was actually drama?  That was amazing.  No, why?  Because it was real.  It was actually people.  Back then, I remember reading a bunch of articles.  They filmed for six months.  Yeah.  To get their show.  They don't do that now.  No, they're barely in there a month.  And fucking, they make drama.  They create situations. 
[01:01:00]  I was watching that dumbass Buck Wilde show.  It's terrible.  It's fucking terrible.  Is it really?  And the thing is, it's not a show where you get to know each person's personality and  they build a show and based on what happens, like that's the drama, they create drama.  It's like, let's get these hillbillies, we'll get them a fucking dump truck and make a swimming  pool in the back of the dump truck.  They don't, you know they didn't do that.  You don't think they did that?  No.  You don't think someone in the area did that once and they-  Maybe once, but it's so contrived. 
[01:01:30]  It's like this, it's so fake, phony and-  Do you think-  You don't do that many things in a day.  So basically, they probably got a bunch of writers that talked to Hillbillies and said,  okay, once I remember this guy that did this and then one time we did this and they put  it all together for this show?  Yeah.  Bingo.  Oh wow, they tricked me because I'm thinking they just found a bunch of kids that-  No, it's too much shit in one day.  They're having fucking the time of their lives.  You know what Buck Wilde is?  Yeah.  It's just, hey, New York, look at how those people talk.  It really is, yeah. 
[01:02:00]  And they got a subtitle, everybody, because they talk like hillbillies.  You can't understand them.  The chicks are all just a little too chunky and they, you'd fuck them, but they're kind  of sloppy.  Right.  The last one was like, hey, look at the way they put hair gel in their hair in Jersey.  That's fucking crazy.  Hey, rest of the country, look at Jersey.  They're crazy.  And now it's like, look at these Southern idiots.  Yeah, yeah.  It's just crazy.  She just did a big smile as she walked by.  I guess she knows we were talking about the real world.  Oh.  Oh, Mars tipped her off.  Ah, they're talking about you. 
[01:02:30]  What a rat he is.  Mars is a rat.  It's a family of rats.  God damn rat.  Would you rat us out?  Oh, we heard it.  Why the big smile?  She's never smiled at us.  She's polite and nice to us, but she never smiled like that.  She wants to thank you very much for not dogging the first season of the real world.  I liked the first season.  Because she was an idiot.  How'd she know we were talking about it?  She heard it down the curb.  I liked the first season.  It was probably one of the best seasons.  Yeah, we didn't.  Because it was real.  Yeah.  It was like, they didn't cast them like, we need the guy that fucking, you know, is  the outrageous womanizer. 
[01:03:00]  And then we need this guy.  I liked the second season.  The second one was good, too.  You had the guy that wore the cowboy hat who wanted to be a country singer.  And never fucking made it.  And it's so easy to be a country singer.  Oh, man.  There's a British guy?  Country Western singer.  Irish.  Yeah, that guy.  And then you had Tammy, who, you know, fast forward, what, 15 years is on Basketball  Wives.  And she was the one.  And she was a complete and utter nightmare.  She was the one that got pissed off that she got her covers ripped off. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And got the guy to eat golf the show.  That was the one Jimmy was talking about.  Yeah, yeah.  She was married to who again?  Comic got thrown off.  I don't remember which one.  Oh, fuck.  But she's on Basketball Wives.  What did Dave exactly do?  Did he just...  He ripped her covers off.  She was in bed.  She was in bed, I think, naked.  Or maybe at the most brown panties.  She had a nice shirt and panties on.  Oh, panties on.  And he grabbed the blanket and started pulling it off of her.  And she's like, no, no.  Was he trying to be funny or trying to see her?  He was just trying to be funny.  He was just trying to be like...  And she was laughing at the time. 
[01:04:00]  And then it turned out to be this big controversy.  She was filing it as sexual assault.  Yeah.  Was that...  Then she tried to file it as sexual assault.  Fuck her.  She's a nightmare.  You got to see her on Basketball Wives.  She fights with everybody.  That's what happens when people stop being polite.  Stephon Marbury.  She was married, too.  And start being real.  Start being real.  Yeah.  The real world.  Whatever happened to the country western singer?  True story.  Nothing.  Look, he's got his big...  Remember that?  The true story.  And then he went, true story.  He's trying to sing it like country.  No. 
[01:04:30]  He was convinced he was going to Nashville any moment.  At any moment.  He was like...  Wasn't Garth Brooks really popular at that time?  Very popular.  Yeah.  I think he was like...  He was trying to be exactly that.  Yeah.  He was trying to be like Garth Brooks.  Wore those same weird colored shirts.  Uh-huh.  Like he was a country guy, but he was new country.  Rocking country, yo.  I bet you you could find him singing right now.  Oh, I'm sure he's still singing somewhere.  Find his name and find a current YouTube video.  Covering his horseshoe bald head with that fucking cowboy hat.  Yeah.  He's like Duvall in that fucking lonesome dub set. 
[01:05:00]  I bet you that he's still trying to make it.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  This is interesting.  Oh, I remember that broad.  Oh, she was Hawaii.  That was Ruthie from Hawaii.  Ruthie from Hawaii was a wild one.  She was the drunk one.  Yeah.  And she had a twin sister.  God, how do we remember this shit?  I don't know.  I haven't thought of this in years.  What kind of name is Ruthie?  Yo, Ruthie.  All right, there he is.  John.  John Brennan.  It's still wearing those cowboy hats. 
[01:05:30]  Okay, we got one from 2007.  There he is.  That's good enough.  Here we go.  John Brennan.  It's L.A. season.  I'm going to be a country singer one day when you like it.  Open hostility.  Oh, I remember that.  It's a lot of intro.  Where is he now?  Is it a where is he now?  I guess so.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Look at him.  Go full screen.  I got to see and hear this.  Oh, I was kidding.  But I guess I wasn't.  He looks like the guy. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, no.  He's got hair on his head, I think.  He's a big boy.  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  He looks like a guy that sells you insurance.  He looks like a lot of radio programmers.  Oh, look what happens.  He plays country music when he gets time off his regular guy job.  Yeah, because, you know, he's got a family to support.  Hit us.  To the way that I'm going to change.  So, where is John Brennan now?  Here I am in Owensboro, Kentucky, my hometown.  Oh.  And I leave worship at my church here every Sunday.  We love you, Jesus. 
[01:06:30]  Oh, he's good now.  Jesus sings at the church.  That's right.  John's keeping the faith full time.  And he brought his guitar with him.  He's on the E-Rock diet plan.  The hell happened to that guy?  He's the fact that Jesus did die on the cross.  About eight years ago, I realized that just my love for church and my love for God, there  was an opportunity there to use my musical ability.  Because it wasn't working in any other.  They don't do you in church. 
[01:07:00]  There's nothing like more of them turning up a loud electric guitar and using it to praise God.  God loves electric guitars.  Yes, that's why he made them.  And flat hair.  Yeah.  But John didn't go straight from MTV to Rocky.  Whoa.  Do you want more of this?  I don't know.  They showed young John doing something.  He had to deal with his own real world.  Jumping back into regular life was not easy.  When the show's over and you're not living in a real world house anymore, nobody cares that  you're tying your shoe.  And you go through this whole psychological thing of, oh, suddenly I'm unimportant in him. 
[01:07:30]  Ah.  And that suits this cowboy just fine.  Sometimes people recognize me right off the bat.  It started where it all.  It really is.  I'm sort of seeing that I might be able to blend back into greater society.  Might be.  It's fucking 20 years later.  In case you were wondering, this 30-something single guy is still a proud virgin.  I am still pursuing.  Okay.  All right.  He's gay.  I am still promoting.  I'm going to say.  I'm going to say.  Oh, he's got a smoke machine. 
[01:08:00]  That's the devil.  Garth Brooks.  Again.  He's still trying this.  I'm not giving up that dream.  I'm still working on it.  Oh.  I've got big goals in life.  And I don't want to be the guy from MTV.  Hey, you're John from the real world.  Well, no, I'm John Brennan.  And I realized you're so into the real world. 
[01:08:30]  No, I'm John Brennan.  I want to do something in life.  Oh, no.  Oh, look at that audience.  Wow.  But that's 2007.  Is there any other updates?  Yeah, what's happened?  That's wow.  That's five, six years ago.  Yeah, come on.  He's got to have.  He's got to have.  He's got to have saying six years ago.  He's got to have made it.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  You know it's bad when another guy named John Brennan pops up.  Oh, John Brennan's getting the year.  You're on real world.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't.  Wow.  That's it.  I don't see a lot.  The crack goes cold. 
[01:09:00]  No one.  There's some clips from the real world.  Oh, good.  I love those.  Oh, boy.  Nothing, huh?  How about on YouTube?  That's where I'm at.  Oh.  No, I thought you were still on the Google search.  Oh, see.  See, then.  Before we break or anything, I just got another rumor that we're in reference to the wall.  Yeah.  Oh.  It's tipped off to me.  Move that wall.  Right.  And four.  This is just a rumor.  You know, I hear all the rumors around here.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Start most of them. 
[01:09:30]  But from what I've been told, a certain department has heard that that studio has already been  promised to someone else.  What?  What?  What's the...  Who?  Shade 45.  What?  What?  From what I'm told, a certain department is under the assumption that Shade 45 is going  to be moving there.  But what about their studio?  They got a studio?  Why would they have a studio?  I guess they would prefer to be in the other studio. 
[01:10:00]  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, man.  We're never going to win that battle, either.  Why?  Well, oh.  I don't know about that.  Good luck.  What's wrong with their studio?  Like...  I've been in there.  There's nothing wrong with that studio.  Is it the same as ours, size?  Who's telling you this, Sam Roberts?  I'll just say, apparently, the engineering department is buzzing.  Oh, my gosh.  Who's the big mouth in engineering?  Where's Mars? 
[01:10:30]  Mars.  Mars.  Get in here, Mars.  What's your, like, squiggy hello?  What the fuck?  What do you know about that studio?  Come on, Mars.  You knew we were talking about it this morning, too.  You didn't see it with Sabrina, Sam?  That's our new thing.  We've been asking for a bigger space since we got here.  Well, I got...  This is perfect for us to just move the wall down, and we got our space.  What are you hearing?  What's your confidence level?  I got wind of it today, in reference to Shade 45 needs more room.  Right.  Even though that studio's not bigger, it's just the layout.  Right.  So instead of actually having to change equipment in a layout, the layout in that studio, there's 
[01:11:00]  much more walking space.  The layout in Shade 45 is horrible.  Right.  So why don't they rework the space they got?  Because they'd have to drill holes.  Oh, my God.  Man, we're fucked.  Fucked.  Because we don't have the proper guys working for our channel.  Well, because they realize, wait a minute, Shade 45 wants more space.  We could just rework some things in there.  Right.  Or not lift a finger and just put them in that studio.  Fuck me.  Correct?  We should have... 
[01:11:30]  Well, Bob is not really...  Is he on this?  Please.  Do you still want me to check...  Yes, of course.  And we want to fight for it.  Yeah.  Good.  Fight, fight.  Exactly.  We shouldn't have to fight and beg for every fucking single man.  Because we don't have a guy that is even aware of what we're looking for.  He just goes through his day praying we don't mention him. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, there's not really a person that sits there and has the interest...  He's not even aware.  Like, we only found out about the Martha Stewart channel going away probably a week before Christmas.  These idiots down the hall have been aware for a while.  So then if you're, like, babysitting this fucking channel, why wouldn't you, like, aggressively look into it right away?  Right?  This studio stinks.  It's embarrassing.  Of course it is.  And then we have A-listers at this point, you know, sitting in our horrible office as a green room. 
[01:12:30]  And they're going to go into Shade 45 studio after here, and they'll be like, now this, this is a studio.  Now this is what should happen.  Unless they're going to expand us to their studio.  Maybe they'll just build the wall bigger and make us in Shade 1 studio.  No, because I think they're going to block the hallway and build walls.  That's not a bad idea, because they could go that way.  It's not that much further.  No, it's not any different.  It's not a bad idea.  You think they're going to build walls covering the hallway up?  Why not?  Here's why. 
[01:13:00]  Oh, my God.  They're going to drill holes in the console.  Here's why they might do that.  Because they may think it is easier than knocking walls down to just build extra glass.  Because they'd still have to knock walls down.  Good point.  No.  There's no fucking way.  That logistically is a fucking complete nightmare.  There'd be no way in hell.  This is what should happen.  We've been here a lot longer than those guys.  And we like those guys.  They should move the wall.  Give us a nice big space, which we've been asking for three and a half years. 
[01:13:30]  We can bring in our audience and bleachers on Fridays.  Right.  That'd be really, really great.  We love that about our show.  And when we don't feel like having a Friday audience, we just don't.  But it'll be an option that we could have.  Yes.  And then they should rework their studio if it's laid out horribly to give them more space.  You'd feel inspired.  Like the shows would just sound better because you guys would be like...  Better product.  We'd give the company a better product.  I feel good in here.  I have a suggestion, which I'll say off air, which might entice them a little bit more. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, stop.  Are they even open right now?  Oh, Kenny Anderson?  I know.  Of course you do.  Huh?  I'm being corrected.  Corrected.  Corrected.  It doesn't matter.  But Tammy from the real world was married to Kenny Anderson.  I should have known that.  Oh.  I don't know.  Yeah.  And then he went to a pretty bad divorce, and that's why she was on Basketball Wives.  Oh.  Yeah. 
[01:14:30]  All right.  So no Radio Wizard yet?  I'll check.  But Mars is already on it, that they might be giving it to...  A little gossipy Gertie.  I mean, the engineering department is a very gossipy department.  They're entrenched.  They got their moles everywhere.  They may have just heard that Shade wants it.  Yeah, we all want it.  If you remember, Mars was also the one that leaked the information that all the...  All the offices were becoming studios.  Which, I mean, I...  It's nonsense, so...  Mars is a fucking disinformation maven. 
[01:15:00]  He just goes around spouting off shit.  Well, it's not his...  He's not good with the language.  So that's true.  Larry, you think it's the language barrier?  Yeah.  He doesn't know what they're saying to him.  So who do we talk to about the wall today?  Ah, Radio Wizard.  Yeah, I've been assigned to double check.  Got to go right to Scott.  I'm going...  I'll march down the hall.  When is he here?  Scott, I don't know.  I mean, I...  Find out when he's here, because I don't deal with those fucking low-level guys anymore  in the year 2013.  Ouch. 
[01:15:30]  Because I'm so sick of...  Well, we're working on it.  We're, uh...  Okay.  We don't need no education.  We're working on it.  Are you?  What are you working on?  What do they do?  They're working on trying to get you to stop talking to them about it.  The public file?  Oh.  Public file.  Someone else.  Yes.  Earl.  What are you doing today, Earl?  Well, I've got to do the public file.  Stupid Earl knows how to take a good photograph.  Yes, he does. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, Earl is Mr. Photographer now.  He decided to take a photography when now everyone could do it because of Instagram, but he's still  really good at it.  He's very good at taking a good photograph.  He took my most prized possession photo ever.  Oh.  Earl took the photo of me in Sabbath.  Oh.  And you can tell that he knows what he's doing, right?  It's the perfect photo.  Is it?  It's my most cherished possession.  Earl's good at...  Coughing.  Earl's good at taking pictures, nice pictures, and announcing that old people from R&B music  are dead. 
[01:16:30]  That you never know in the first place.  Right.  Hey, rest easy, brother.  What?  Look at that shot of Times Square.  Wow, that's pretty fucking good.  That's amazing.  You could put that in what they call a magazine.  You could easily put that in a magazine.  Wow.  But it's unfortunate that he picked up this hobby, you know.  Yeah.  Now.  Stay late in a dollar show when he's 60.  Is that a camera or an iPhone?  I can't.  No, he's got some good cameras and stuff.  He's got the pro camera.  Give him the big plug today because I'm telling you, he takes a good photograph.  Yeah, there's all of his good photos are on edouglas528.tumblr.com. 
[01:17:00]  So say that again, edouglas528.tumblr.com.  Yeah, edouglas528.tumblr.  On Tumblr.  What a terrible name.  But look at the Times Square photo with the confetti fall from the sky.  That is really nice.  It's pretty amazing.  Then he gets a little artsy at times, but that's a really good shot right there.  Or not going to describe the photograph.  No, it's, you know, a tree, Central Park.  Him walking through the projects.  All right, well.  Oh, shit.  There's someone stealing his camera. 
[01:17:30]  That's a really good photograph.  This looks like a Jay-Z video.  Kind of like an Ansel Adams type feel to that one.  Turn that upside down.  Looks like a lung x-ray.  Hey, he does a good job.  But he's not going to be able to make any money off it.  Poor bastard.  Oh, that's nice.  That's Washington Square Park.  Washington with a Christmas tree.  Oh, and a menorah.  A menorah.  He's very diverse.  It all started with him framing photos.  Right?  And trying to hang frame photos.  Almost hanging.  Then they got.  Oh, boy.  No.  Close. 
[01:18:00]  I thought I knew where you were going there.  Yeah, you did.  That's the filter.  Yeah.  Sometimes it works.  All right.  I had a bomberoo coming.  Closed up the doors and flew away.  Letterman's in therapy.  We got audio of him talking to Oprah.  Oh, cool.  Does he cry?  Close.  Nice.  Serious Letterman.  Yeah.  Got Jimmy Kimmel starting this week, right?  Yeah.  Seventh.  What's that?  Today.  Today.  Today's taking on Leno and Letterman. 
[01:18:30]  Wow.  That's going to be interesting.  Yeah.  They duct taped the guy on an airplane.  Oh, yeah.  That's on Friday, I think.  We're over there.  That's great.  What a loser.  Oh, boy.  Just bothering everyone.  Don't bother people.  Enough already.  Kind of fly.  All right.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  O.P. and Anthony.  The Sirius XM.  In a time of economic depression and ruthless dictatorship,  one man would unify an entire society. 
[01:19:00]  I'm the Messiah.  With a message of strength.  Look, I'm walking on water.  A message of unity.  Eats my bodies.  Eats my bodies.  Drinks my blood.  A can of spinach.  I am the savior, man.  But some questioned his power. 
[01:19:30]  I hate those Jews.  And vowed to destroy him.  It's Pontius Brutus.  This summer.  A crown of thorns.  A crown of thorns gets hurt in me head.  Prepare to be blown down.  Them nails get me to the cross.  When an ordinary sailor man is transformed into a legend.  If I could only get to my spinach through these nails. 
[01:20:00]  The passion of Popeye.  A blowin' through me hands.  Sirius XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Watching the football end.  Not a minute. 
[01:20:30]  Wow.  I know.  Wow.  I know.  Pretty gay, right?  Pretty gay.  You didn't play all football?  I was not Mr. Sports Guy.  I didn't really like it.  I didn't like playing it.  I didn't like gym class.  I don't mind football.  But I certainly don't go out of my way to make sure I catch the game.  So, yeah.  I'm queer, as they say.  Why even talk about it then?  Well, go ahead. 
[01:21:00]  Because I know some guy hurt his little tootsie.  Or his leg.  Or his knee.  RJ.  What happened there?  Some say he probably shouldn't be playing.  Came back a little too soon.  Oh, shit.  They kind of kneeded it on.  Twist a roo with the knee late in the game there.  That looked painful from the clips I saw.  And I know hockey.  I don't know.  Coming back.  What's his injury all about?  What kind of knee injury did RG3 suffer?  Does anyone know yet?  Is it an RCL or CRL?  ACLU. 
[01:21:30]  ACLU.  Yeah, I think he pulled his ACLU.  Civil Liberties Union.  The NAACP.  What did he pull?  He twisted the NAACP.  Oh, damn.  And the ACLU.  Oh, damn.  I don't know what it is.  Torn ACL and MCL.  Was it an MCL?  A little of that, too.  MCI?  And his MLB.  MC Hammer?  And, all right, you get it.  So your team won.  Congratulations.  Oh, what?  I'm just talking to the...  Oh, oh, okay. 
[01:22:00]  You can believe I'm actually talking to that person in his car right now.  I'm rooting for the Jets this season.  Yeah, are you?  Yeah, when's the Super Bowl?  The fucking Jets.  They have to find a GM.  You watching any of the football over the weekend?  Man, playoff football.  Watch a little bit of the...  I like to watch the football.  I wonder what it must be like for a team to actually have a quarterback that doesn't completely collapse.  How frustrating is that?  I mean, for the Cowboys.  To see, like, real quarterbacks.  All the teams playing now, they have real quarterbacks. 
[01:22:30]  Ooh.  We just stopped off down the hall.  Yeah?  What'd you have?  Wait, who'd you talk to?  I just said hi to Garris.  I was getting...  Oh, Garris.  Oh.  What did he have to say?  Did you talk to him about the thing?  The wall?  Yeah.  Yeah, of course.  Oh.  And what did he say?  And what was the first thing he said?  Well, I said to him, has there been any follow-up?  And he said no.  I mean, there's been no other...  But has he talked to anybody?  Well, I'm sure that they have.  But it's more... 
[01:23:00]  He didn't know the answer.  Of course.  Why does he even...  But he's...  Why does he even work with us?  But he said there's a...  You know, at times, there's a lot of...  A press for big office, for big studio space.  And it's...  You know, to have another studio that you can't do bigger things in might be difficult.  But he honestly...  I think he just knows their thinking.  He's not speaking for them.  He's just giving an opinion on what they're going to say. 
[01:23:30]  Huh.  Here's what's going to happen.  What they should say is...  Well, that's one of our, you know, big shows here on the platform.  We're not going to get it.  They've been talking about having a bigger studio since they got here.  That was the one thing, actually, that was a big issue when they first got here.  And now we have the opportunity.  Not going to happen.  It so isn't going to happen.  I know.  So isn't happening.  It just pushes the whole show forward.  It really would.  It would add a new angle. 
[01:24:00]  And the publicists and the celebrities come by and see a bigger, nicer space.  It would be such an...  Like, we would do a better show because we would have different things we could do.  You would just elevate the show in general.  Yes.  We would be able to do things that we aren't able to do now.  So he obviously has no authority, no clue, no power as far as this goes.  Well, I don't know.  I don't even know who he's talked to. 
[01:24:30]  Sam, what did he say to you?  He just said no.  I said, is there any update or news on the wall thing?  And he said no.  So Anthony's answer was from earlier, this is the first I'm hearing of it.  That was the answer I thought we were going to get.  And I went with the tried and true, we're looking into it.  Well, I think you got that.  Looking.  But I haven't gotten anything.  I know the weekly Jim Norton show needs the extra studio space.  What?  You mean Wednesdays?  Yeah, I'm bringing in a whole crew of dancing girls to make my show bigger, to give it a live feel. 
[01:25:00]  Yes.  So day four of Move That Wall is...  It's a bust.  It's a bust.  A setback, I think.  I think this is a setback on day four.  If anything got bad news.  Remember day four?  We'll be going, remember day four?  That was a big setback.  So when does Greenstein get in here?  Oh, boy.  I have no idea.  Because I'll talk to him.  It's not my business.  I'll talk to him.  All right.  I remember that story from India? 
[01:25:30]  Yes.  One of my peeps on the old Twitter, Pretty Plus More.  Oh.  I like her tweets.  She writes, oh, speaking of what happened in India, remember when the ferry capsized there years ago?  Do you remember that big ferry capsizing in India?  They're always having those over there, but...  That's exactly what I was thinking as I'm reading this.  I'm like, which one?  It's like that.  She writes, there happened to be an American lifeguard on board with advanced training.  During the horror, while in the water, she was instructing people how to take off their 
[01:26:00]  pants and blow them up to use as flotation device.  You know, you could do that.  I play jokes on people.  Yeah, yeah.  You could actually use your own pants to...  Yeah, you could tie the feet end together.  And then you lift it up and put it on top of the water.  And it fills up with water like that.  Fills up with air.  It fills up with air.  Yeah.  You kind of make a little parachute with it.  And it's a primitive flotation device.  Yeah.  So this lifeguard was trying to show the people that were in the water drowning.  During the horror, while in the water, she was instructing people how to take off their 
[01:26:30]  pants and blow them up to use as a flotation device.  Oh, boy.  While drowning in capital letters, because this came out, the men were trying to rape her  in the water.  What fucking...  They have a shit view of women in that culture.  Yes.  It's a terrible.  It's a shitty culture.  It's fucking amazing we deal with these countries anyway.  They were drowning and trying to get a rape.  Right.  God damn.  Yeah.  They have fucking zero respect for women.  They're awful.  No.  Just awful.  Yeah.  That's why in this country when certain things happen and people bitch about it and they're  like, you know, my rights are being violated or this, that. 
[01:27:00]  It's like, go somewhere else.  Look at how they're treated.  And why do we still deal with them?  Why do we still give money to, like, Egypt and weapons?  I have no idea.  We're giving, like, tanks and fucking planes to the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.  Because we're fucking stupid.  Yes.  We're a dumb country.  And we're broke and we're still giving money to fucking other countries.  Fuck them.  Well, we're just going to raise the debt ceiling.  That's all we got to do.  The debt ceiling. 
[01:27:30]  Raise that debt ceiling.  Yep.  Yikes.  Well, we can't kick the can anymore.  Huh?  They're using that kick the can analogy a lot.  Oh, yeah?  For what?  I don't know.  For the fiscal cliff or something.  We can't continue to kick the can or something.  They just keep saying that over and over again.  Like, just kick it away, it'll go away.  I guess.  I don't know.  I think there's even a montage out there of kick the can if you want to try to find it, Sam.  Every politician is using that.  Kick the can.  We can't continue to kick the can. 
[01:28:00]  They love analogies down there in Washington, and they all use them.  Uh-huh.  If you can find that, that'd be great.  Remember Main Street, Wall Street?  No worries.  Yeah, all that.  See?  Oh, what are some of the other ones?  There you go.  Main Street, Wall Street.  Kick the can is one they're using a lot.  Ugh.  Joe the plumber.  Joe the plumber.  Um.  Uh.  Yeah, that was Washington.  Oh, you mentioned hockey.  Yes.  Apparently, they're going to have a shortened season.  Hang on.  Well, I'm a huge hockey fan.  And. 
[01:28:30]  I'm an Islanders fan.  Yeah.  And.  They got a young team.  They got some young players.  So, we'll see if they can turn it around.  I have no idea.  I'm just.  I just wish they would say, fuck you to the Coliseum a year or two early and move to Brooklyn  immediately.  Yeah.  That's going to happen.  Because it's a horrendous tease knowing that the Islanders are going to be in that beautiful  arena.  Yeah.  They're in Brooklyn.  And I still got to go out to those dumb games at the Nassau Coliseum.  When do they move?  What do we got?  Another year?  2015?  Something like that.  That's definitely happening. 
[01:29:00]  So, yeah.  So, I think they got to do this season and next season at the Coliseum still.  Roland have a shirt yet?  He does have a shirt.  And Islanders.  Is he going to be the Brooklyn Islanders?  I don't know.  I don't know what they're going to do.  They'll probably keep it New York Islanders just because it's still in New York.  But.  Why wouldn't you, if you owned the Islanders, just go, fuck you to the Coliseum, take the  hit, and start playing there immediately in Brooklyn?  Because they'd probably sue the new arena.  Wouldn't let them in.  They'd probably sue them.  They wouldn't get involved.  They would make sure that you're clear of your contract before they let you move in and 
[01:29:30]  play there because you'd sue them.  They don't want to deal with litigation.  They'd rather say, wait two years.  It'll take longer to work out in court.  Yeah.  But the amount of money they would make right off the bat.  Because, I mean, they'll get a lot more people going to the games in Brooklyn.  Yeah.  That Coliseum's just going to be a fucking relic after that.  I don't know what they're going to use it for.  I don't know how to, what, they're going to keep it open for a concert here and there?  What concert?  And most concerts don't fill up a remas like that anymore.  No.  There's not many that do. 
[01:30:00]  I want to open and call it the Coliseum Comedy Club.  Oh.  And I want to just do it in the round and perform there every week just to kind of make ends  meet.  You'd have to sell out, like, fucking 15,000 seats.  Yeah, but, yeah, 15, it's not like it's 18.  All right.  I'll tell you this much.  For people that are on the fence with hockey, you watch this shortened season.  What a play there.  This shortened season.  It's going to be amazing.  Yeah.  Yeah, because every game really matters.  That's true.  I think you're going to see a lot more action, a lot more hitting.  So I think it's going to be, it's going to turn out to be a great, great season of hockey. 
[01:30:30]  But what a dumb sport to just shoot themselves in the foot every time.  They're just dumb.  Yeah, they do it all the time.  They had some good momentum.  Amazing.  With Olympic hockey and all that shit going down.  The Winter Classic, all that.  Is this one the owner's fault?  Ah, that's complicated.  Well, there was a contract.  It's almost split down the middle whose fault it is.  But wasn't there a contract that the owners didn't honor or am I crazy?  Yeah, that's what I've heard.  Okay.  They actually had a contract and they said, ah, nah, we're going to break that contract.  We don't like that.  Is that what happened? 
[01:31:00]  I think.  People that know more about this shit than me should call up.  Motherfuckers.  Motherfuckers.  Yeah, motherfucker.  I want to see Texas Chainsaw 3D.  I saw it.  How was it?  You saw it?  Yeah.  Was there a lot of three-dimensional action?  Oh, I hope so.  There were a couple of the old 3D shots, like the chainsaw pointing straight at the right  I wouldn't like that at all.  Oh, my God.  But, you know, it was fun.  It was good.  If you like those types of movies.  How was Parental Guidance?  I didn't see Parental Guidance. 
[01:31:30]  Now, the movie I want to see, because I saw the trailer for it, is the remake of Evil  Dead.  That looks scary as fuck!  Who's in that?  Woo!  When does that start?  They're remaking it, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  Now, the first one, obviously, great cult following, so very hard to build on that.  Like, people don't want a remake, but I saw this trailer.  It looks pretty creepy.  And Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi, I think, are both producers. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah, there you go.  Let's hear a little of this.  So we'll get Bruce Campbell back.  I'd love to see some, too.  Watch the trailer.  This is scary.  No, it can't be scary.  I never get scared.  Make it big.  Oh, yeah.  Little cabin, right?  Woods, very creepy.  I guess that's Ash.  She's scared. 
[01:32:30]  Necmonicon, motherfucker.  It gets very cringy and very creepy.  Looks great.  Oh, boy.  Man. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, man.  Shit.  Doesn't this look creepy, dude?  The tree ray, you see?  Tree ray.  Tree's got a big peck off.  Oh, man.  Oh, wow.  It's a Brazilian movie.  I released something from that book.  God damn it.  Something evil.  This thing is attached to me as soul. 
[01:33:30]  Mother of the dead.  To kill her.  What a bad bitch.  I'd hate to live there.  You are going to die tonight.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  Dude.  Look at that thing in the fucking face.  Holy shit.  It's crazy.  Ow.  A lot of blood.  We're going to die tonight. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  Time to go.  Let's see.  Oh.  Ah.  Holy shit.  I wish that was out now.  And that's why we need a visual element.  Because there was.  We were just.  We were just watching by it.  Yeah.  There's no describing it.  There's no.  That gave me chills. 
[01:34:30]  Totally.  I got a rod.  And she licks the knife.  She licks that razor.  And it's like.  And her tongue splits.  And then she starts making out with the other chick.  That's fucking hot.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Oof.  I got goosebumps.  That fucking thing in the basement.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  And they like did something digitally to her face.  That's creepy as shit.  Fuck you.  I'm not a pussy.  Yeah, you're right.  That would have been cool.  That's a pussy.  Fuck you.  To have like a streaming thing where we show that and talk.  Of course it would.  Yeah, it's pretty easy to do too. 
[01:35:00]  That's pretty creepy, man.  You going to see Texas Chainsaw?  You know.  I might see it in a.  Not 3D.  Was it as good as that trailer?  No.  He's a nice guy.  I love him.  When is Star?  Wait.  When is Star?  When is Star?  He got us on down the hall.  When is it out?  And there's a delay.  So you're going to get caught today.  When is it out?  Because the real world girl heard us today.  Texas Chainsaw?  No, no.  It's not this one. 
[01:35:30]  Spring.  I want to see if he shakes his head as he's going by the audio.  April?  I think we might be safe.  I think he's safe.  There you go.  It's live in the office, so there's no delay.  Oh, okay.  Good.  We're good?  How about we close our office door today?  How did he fuck that thing?  Exactly.  Do you ever jerk off thinking about her?  Pew, pew.  No.  Did you see Tiger Woods' ex-wife there in the paper today in the bikini?  Oh, that was her.  Holy fuck.  Let me take a little look.  She's beautiful. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah, that's his ex.  Well, you know.  Her or a fucking.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's pretty hot.  I'd go for the Perkins waitress.  But I'll bet you that Perkins waitress is a better fuck, though.  Maybe.  Guaranteed.  She was trying to plead.  This girl is a fucking beautiful blonde who's been, guys have loved her her whole life.  All right.  That's terrible.  This, you know, she didn't put any effort into it.  She was probably like an average lady.  She'd probably look at him like, I love you.  And he's probably like, yuck.  Right.  Yuck.  But meanwhile, that Perkins waitress is probably fucking three fingers deep in his ass. 
[01:36:30]  Real fucking good girl.  Eat his ass.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Yeah, he's probably like, I got the flu.  And she's like, I don't give a turkey.  Ate his.  I just played 36 holes ass.  She dug her fingernails into his cheeks and ripped his asshole open.  Fucking ate it.  Like it was a pie.  Like a fucking chicken pot pie.  Swamp.  Like it was a Grand Slam.  Is it Grand Slam over there, Denny's?  The Grand Slam?  Yes.  I had a dream last night.  I had a dream. 
[01:37:00]  That I was hosting a new show, a video, which was supposed to happen, but it's probably not  going to now, thanks to...  And Ozzy was the headline act, so I had to do my show at 8, and Ozzy's show was at 10.  And I was trying to have stupid Jonathan tell me so I could Twitter the address, but nobody  could find out where we were, what tent we were in.  That's my dream.  I can't look.  Yeah.  Oh, he's coming.  He's coming back.  Hold on. 
[01:37:30]  Hold on.  Oh, I can't look.  I'm going to go up in a wave today.  I'm going to make believe we just talked about some of my sand.  Hey, what's up?  And there he goes.  Oh, he's such a nice guy.  I just got a nod from him.  Oh, you did?  Yes, I did.  He's kind of like, yes.  I still think of her.  So Texas Chainsaw was the big moneymaker this weekend.  Oh, it was?  Yeah.  DeJango Unchained.  Oh, do we have the Samuel Jackson thing?  I hope DeJango comes to my theater I went to to watch Zero Dark Thirty. 
[01:38:00]  Why is The Hobbit just kind of sitting there, sort of under the radar in a weird way?  I know it's doing well, but no one's really talking about The Hobbit like they talked about  the Lord of the Rings movies.  It's the same shit.  I don't know if people are saying it's the same shit, and it is making a lot of money.  It was in third place, so it's still doing well, but you don't feel the buzz like past  movies.  It's not like you're looking at something new.  In that sort of franchise.  What?  Like The Lord of the Rings was like new.  Like you look at it and it looks new. 
[01:38:30]  Like this looks like The Lord of the Rings.  No, The Hobbit looked fucking new with the new technology.  People didn't even like the new technology.  I like the new technology.  I haven't seen it with the new technology yet.  You should go.  And saw your standard issue, you know, 24 frames per second, non-3D version.  You should go with the new technology.  I want to.  Just to like make the comparison.  But the thought of sitting that long and seeing the same movie again.  Yeah.  I should have went first to see it with the new technology, but I kind of wanted to.  Oh.  Because I heard like it looks like fucking a whole movie. 
[01:39:00]  No.  Meh.  No.  You gotta go.  Yeah.  Gotta go.  I'll see it.  Damn it.  Speaking of Django, I like to say Django, but of course it's Django.  Yeah.  That reporter's speaking out.  What did he say?  He wouldn't say the N-word.  Oh.  What's he saying?  A bunch of times he said it.  I said the N-word on Friday right in front of Hoot Kid.  I heard that.  Do you have that?  No.  No. 
[01:39:30]  Do you know what we're looking for?  He was a little shocked by it.  He has the O-B saying the N-word in front of Hoot Kid?  Oh, yes.  Hang on.  What were you doing before that that you just walked in?  I just brought a disc in there.  Oh.  He did.  He was.  I saw him.  He fucking came in with a disc.  He was meandering.  If we're keeping it fair, he was busy.  Keep it fair.  Keep it fair.  All right.  Let's see.  Let's take one of those big shits.  Let's see.  No, I'll let you know.  All right.  He hasn't been doing that since we made the Sounders.  I know, right?  What the fuck?  He tries to sneak. 
[01:40:00]  I'm trying to find a story, but I see this one today.  Jimmy Kimmel slams Jay Leno.  He totally sold out.  Jimmy Kimmel comes from that radio world, and he's doing radio wars.  Radio wars with late-night TV.  And I don't know if Leno and Letterman understand that world.  I don't know.  But it looks like he's definitely going to go old school, like he's doing a radio show.  Throw him a little beating?  Letterman's cool with Kimmel.  He did Kimmel's show when he was here in Brooklyn.  I don't think he's cool with them now that he's directly competing with them.  No.  No, they talked about it.  Oh, they did? 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  And?  What'd they say?  He was, I mean, for on air, he was friendly about it.  I'm sure he's not happy it's going 1130, but as far as publicly goes, they're friendly  about it.  Yeah.  It's because they have a common enemy.  The people that attack Leno the most are the people who, you know, fucking either feel  like they should have his job, or they're going to be competing with him in their jobs.  But isn't Leno still doing very well?  Yeah.  Isn't he the number one guy in late night?  I think so.  I actually haven't looked great.  Isn't he number one in all his demos?  I don't know.  So, what's the problem? 
[01:41:00]  And aren't you supposed to sell out if you're doing, like, network TV?  But I don't know what they can, what does Jimmy consider selling out?  Like, how did he sell out from being what?  Like, what would he have done different to not be a seller?  In the article, he talks about his, Jay's stand-up, too.  And it's funny, in the Oprah interview, Dave says Jay's the funniest stand-up he's ever  seen.  I didn't sell out, son.  I bought in.  Yeah.  Dave said Jay's the funniest guy he's ever known.  SLC Punk.  Yes, sir.  Hasn't Jay pretty much been mainstream as long as we can remember?  I think he's always been that guy. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah, he's never been that guy.  Yeah, yeah.  I've never thought of him as not a mainstream guy.  He has a little edge to his, and he does have a little edge to his monologue every night.  Whatever.  Where's the OP drop?  Damn it.  It's not that guy.  Yo, nigga, what up?  Oh, man.  That actually sounded pretty authentic.  I try.  I try.  That was pretty good.  You can use that word.  You got to use it properly.  Yeah, yeah.  Yo, nigga, what up?  See?  What up?  It was just who kid walking in. 
[01:42:00]  Oh, really?  It was not even sort of like a, okay, now we're all comfortable moment.  There was no context to it.  No.  Oh, people are now just using who kid in here as an excuse to say nigga.  A hundred percent.  Like, they call up, and they're like, yeah, my nigga.  Yo, nigga, what up?  He got caught up in it.  Yeah.  He gave me a look like, how am I going to deal with this situation?  He wasn't sure.  It was hostile at first.  No, it wasn't.  And then he was like, oh, okay, I'm here with friends.  You can hear the love in that.  That's what I'm saying.  There's nothing but love in that one.  Yo, nigga, what up?  When you walk into a room, and that word is shouted at you first thing. 
[01:42:30]  I went GGA.  Yeah, I know.  That's why.  You had to analyze it a little bit.  I went GGA.  And I think he wanted to make sure I did GGA, and he realized I did GGA.  Oh, yeah, you did.  But it didn't sound like.  And then he was okay with it.  You know what was good, though?  It didn't sound like you were trying to say GGA.  Like, it came out very naturally.  Right.  Let's hear it again.  Yo, nigga, what up?  See?  Yeah.  That was good.  What the fuck?  I didn't keep his hundred.  I didn't either.  Why would he give you a hundred?  Because he had about. 
[01:43:00]  Well, he's bragging about all the money he had on him.  I go, look, you don't care.  Just give me one of those.  Making it rain?  Was he making it rain?  No, I put him on the spot.  Now he had to give me a hundred.  He had about $1,600 in cash in his pocket.  All hundreds.  Just because.  Just because.  Speaking of the N-words, so you got the.  I'm always being compared to the blacks.  Oh, no.  I just want to see what I got.  Let me see.  Oh, my God.  That's some. 
[01:43:30]  Those are all hundreds.  Nine.  You have nine hundreds?  Oh, my God.  Ten.  Eleven.  Look, he just crumples up hundreds like we crumple up dollars.  Eleven.  Like so many nickels and dimes.  Maybe twelve.  All right.  See?  I'm like the homies.  You got to carry some cash with you.  Yeah, but that.  Why?  Why twelve hundred dollars?  Because you just never know.  I'm a credit card man.  You use your tongue, Bertier.  My water fell on the sound machine. 
[01:44:00]  So that's what it worked.  It wasn't me.  The work just had me do my finances over the weekend.  Like get my numbers in order.  Yeah.  I've never been so depressed.  Just anxiety ridden.  Why would she do that to you?  Why?  If you don't have a lot, you should never do your numbers.  Oh, man.  You should never do your numbers.  The future is so bleak.  Is it?  The only thing I want to invest in is a noose.  No stocks, no nothing.  You don't need to invest in that.  I'm sure that we would be happy to get you one.  Please.  Well, that journalist.  Remember this?  I guess we got an update on this. 
[01:44:30]  So why don't we play the original and then we got the update for everybody.  Django, Django, of course.  Samuel Jackson being interviewed by this fucking Houston guy, journalist, and went down like  this.  There's been a lot of controversy surrounding the usage of the N-word in this movie.  No.  No, nobody, none.  The word would be.  Oh, I don't want to say it.  Why not?  Listen, no, he said that.  Have you ever said it?  No, sir. 
[01:45:00]  Try it.  I don't like to say it.  Try it.  Really?  Seriously?  We're not going to have this conversation unless you say it.  You want to move on to another question?  Okay.  See, at that.  Okay, awesome.  I understand where the guy's coming from, but then you say the word.  Just say it.  At that point.  Just say it.  Don't you?  Just be like, well, Sam.  You know.  It's like this.  I don't want to say it.  Oh, come on.  Will you say it?  No, fuck no. 
[01:45:30]  It's not the same thing.  Why do you want me to say it?  You're going to bleep it when you say it on your shelf.  Say it.  I can't say it.  If I say it, this question won't make air.  Okay, forget it.  Okay, I'll skip it.  Sorry, guys.  It was a good question.  No, it wasn't.  It was a great question.  It wasn't a great question if you can't say the word.  Yep.  So anyway, BuzzFeed interviewed this journalist, and he said,  he's an intimidating guy.  I've talked to him once before for the Avengers, and that interview went okay.  Hamilton said of Jackson.  But it's one of those things where I have my own set of moral values. 
[01:46:00]  Oh, bullshit.  Oh, bullshit.  Yeah, I got to.  Just like anybody else, and I'm not going to compromise them for anyone, much less a  celebrity.  What a douchebag.  He also revealed what his question would have been.  My question was going to be, where is that line between that word being offensive and that  word being art?  What does it take for an actor to read a word like that on a script page and say, okay,  I'll say it?  So why didn't he say that?  Not a bad question.  Why didn't he say, where does an actor, the word nigger now, why is that, why did you say 
[01:46:30]  that in the context of the question?  Right.  In the context of a question, it doesn't matter what your ethical or moral, let's say, for  the sake of argument, he's being honest.  And morally and ethically, he doesn't want to use that word because it's offensive.  Using it in the context of that question, when you're talking about the art form and  it being used as a word in that movie, you're not using, you're not calling someone it.  You're fucking using it and asking a question. 
[01:47:00]  It's not like the word doesn't exist.  It's there.  And it's in the movie that the guy's in that you're interviewing.  So it's phony to say that you're, morally, I wouldn't say that word.  Shut up.  You're lying.  It's a good question, too.  It's too bad.  Dummy.  And then he continued, yeah, some people have argued he was empowering the N-word by  refusing to say it.  I completely agree with that.  He's just a being a baby boy.  When you don't say the word, you're actually empowering the word.  Absolutely.  And he said to that, I get that and I understand what the argument is. 
[01:47:30]  And a lot of people say that's the point that Mr. Jackson was trying to prove, Hamilton  said.  But at the end of the day, I just, I don't say it.  Hamilton's a fucking coward and he's worthless.  You can make the argument that I'm making it worse by not saying it, but so be it.  I'm just not going to say it.  Here's the argument.  You're a fucking scaredy cat, fucking fake douchey interviewer.  That's the argument.  Yeah.  You shouldn't have. 
[01:48:00]  Big brave boy.  You shouldn't have went down the N-word path with a question if you couldn't say the word.  If your morals are that high, you shouldn't have fucking went down that road.  Yeah.  You want to ask about the word, then say the word.  It's in the context of a question.  And if you don't know the difference, then you should not be in that line of work.  Well.  Fucking douche.  Oh, well, I'll tell you how it was because I just happened to be going to see Django this  evening.  I'm going to go see Django. 
[01:48:30]  So a moment ago, you had mentioned that, well, the movie theater I like.  Yeah.  They changed the movie.  Finally.  Oh, my God.  It's at one screen.  How about you invite us all to this movie theater?  That would be nice.  What?  Couldn't we all just buy tickets?  Yeah.  I don't think it's on Fandango.  Oh.  Yeah.  One of those deals.  It's a great, it's my favorite theater to go to.  It's old school.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But they serve booze.  And like I said, if at any time you want to get up and go to the bathroom or something, 
[01:49:00]  you don't miss the movie.  You press a single button, the movie stops.  Wow.  And you go to the bathroom, you come back, press the button again, and the movie starts  again.  It's an amazing place.  What time are you watching the movie?  Well, I don't know what the show time is.  Oh.  I don't know when show time is.  I'm assuming somewhere around 7 p.m. is probably when the movie starts.  Rickety old seats?  No.  Very nice seats.  They actually recline.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's great.  It's great.  Well, you're going to have to tell us about this movie tomorrow. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah.  Oh, brother.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I'm psyched.  I want to see D-D-D-D-Tango.  You'll love it.  Yeah.  That's what I'm hearing.  I'm surprised you haven't seen it yet.  That's what I'm hearing.  I guess you couldn't get out to that theater.  Well, no.  Not until now.  They weren't playing it.  It wasn't playing.  They were playing other movies.  It's playing now, though.  Did you guys see the...  I know this is completely in a different direction, but did you see the robots playing Ace of Spades yet? 
[01:50:00]  No.  By Motorhead.  You haven't seen this yet?  No.  Robots?  Robots.  I think I saw it on the old BuzzFeed.  That's why.  Yeah.  Because that interview was on BuzzFeed.  It made me think of this.  All robot rock band.  It's creepy as all.  Didn't Spades say this was going to happen someday?  I think he did.  Yeah.  Yes. 
[01:50:30]  Are they really playing?  Yeah.  It looks like it.  The drums absolutely look like it's really playing.  Yeah.  The guitars.  How the fuck can a robot guitar play like that?  It's fucking sick.  Oh, it made MSN now.  I love that they made the drummer's head bob.  The drummer's head goes to the music.  Unnecessary.  The drummer's head doesn't have to move.  And he's got a hunchback like most drummers because he's kind of moving forward toward the drums.  Dude.  How fucked up is that?  He has lower self-esteem than the other robots. 
[01:51:00]  The only thing this doesn't have.  The hot robot chicks.  I don't think it has vocals.  I think it's just an instrumental.  Boo.  I think.  Wow.  Or maybe I didn't get to that part.  Could you make it to full screen there, sir?  And then read up on what it's all about.  Yeah.  The guitarist is moving.  Holy shit. 
[01:51:30]  The drums got like four arms.  Look at the guitarist moving.  Holy shit.  The guitarist is doing some guitar moves.  The guitarist is doing some guitar moves.  That's frightening. 
[01:52:00]  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  All right, I see how it works.  What do you mean?  I see how it's like the guitarist is actually playing.  It's got like a big thing over the fretboard with like actuators that push down on the strings. 
[01:52:30]  Holy shit.  That drum robot is frightening.  It's got four arms.  Yeah.  I know he said that.  Close enough for the drummer.  It looks cool as hell.  Those aren't arms.  They're all wires.  That one thing is on a track. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, man, that's fucked up.  Is that a drum tech?  Is there a robot drum tech?  Oh, he's doing the foot pedal.  Yeah.  Wow.  That was pretty wild.  That was pretty wild.  All right.  Now, who the fuck did this?  Well, there's a story about it.  God, if I was a band touring, I would get the four-armed fucking robot drummer. 
[01:53:30]  Hell, yeah.  Yeah, fucking Jeff Leppard, and I'll hire him.  I mean, Lars would never allow it, but imagine Metallica, and all of a sudden they introduce the four-armed robot drummer.  The place would lose their fucking minds.  That's unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  That's pretty cool.  That is so cool. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  What's the story on that?  I'm going to go MIT.  Yeah?  I'm going to go J-A-P.  Because they're pretty good with them robots.  That seems like an MIT thing.  Yeah?  Yeah, those kids get bored every once in a while.  Is that the fucking thing that went wrong with the player's leg?  It's the MIT?  Yeah, he lost his MIT.  Yeah.  Twisted it.  That and the ACLU.  ACLU.  F-B-I. 
[01:54:30]  What do we know about the robot band?  Yeah, what's up?  Come on, Sam.  Do a little research.  Come on, Sam.  Stop fucking around.  I mean, they're called Compressor Head.  Compressor Head.  That's a perfect name for that.  They're a trio of robotic contraptions.  They can perform Motorhead's classic Ace of Spades.  The German Mechanical Trio.  German?  Das Gord.  Yeah, Scoot.  Yeah.  Yeah, none of these articles are saying exactly where they're from. 
[01:55:00]  They're saying Compressor Head is scheduled to play with Red Hot Chili Peppers and the Killers at Australia's Big Day Out Festival this summer.  So they've got to program a few more songs.  I'm telling you, man.  Wouldn't you want to see the drummer?  Of course.  That robot drummer especially?  Is someone going to sing with them?  It would be funny to have a singer.  Yeah, you just get a human singer out there.  Oh, I'm sure they would.  And he's rocking with the band.  And he gets in the robot guitar's face and makes fucking rock faces.  Robot's a little dumb fucking praying mantis head.  What a dumb head the robot has. 
[01:55:30]  That's pretty cool.  I bet those things fuck up a lot, though.  Like, I bet they break.  Oh, yeah.  They go to rock or something.  Yeah.  They're going to have, like, the drummer holding a fucking bottle of alcohol.  A little fucking John Bonham tribute.  I don't know how, uh...  God, how do you program that?  A lot of computers.  A lot of fucking, like, pneumatic shit.  That's pretty cool.  That's really cool.  Put that up on the Facebook page.  Opie and Anthony there.  You rock.  What's up?  Thank you.  Got them robots. 
[01:56:00]  Got to watch them robots.  Got to watch them.  They're coming for us.  Of course they are.  What was that?  They took our jobs.  Oh.  Remember that one?  South Park?  Can we play the real Ace of Spades in the break?  Ooh.  Yes.  Because now I want to hear the vocals.  We'll be back.  Cool. 
[01:56:30]  If you like to gamble, I'll tell you I'm your man.  You win some, lose some, it's all the same to me.  The pleasure is to play.  The pain of the death is what you say.  I don't say you agree.  The only God I need is the Ace of Spades. 
[01:57:00]  The Ace of Spades.  The Ace of Spades. 
[01:57:30]  The Ace of Spades.  You know I'm going to lose.  I got blames for fools.  But that's the way I like it, baby.  I don't want to live forever.  And don't forget the Joker.  The Ace of Spades. 
[01:58:00]  Pushing up the energy, I know you've got to see me  Freedom and weep, the dead man's hand again  I see it in your eyes, take one look and die 
[01:58:30]  The only thing you see, you know it's gonna be  The ace of spades, the ace of spades  This is the OPNN3 Show 
[01:59:00]  And now, words of wisdom from the magnificent Steve-O  I can't be bothered with pornography that doesn't have, like, cock in it  I have no time for lesbian pornography  I feel like lesbian pornography, it's like a skateboard video with just footage of ramps and nobody riding them 
[01:59:30]  It's just a complete waste of time  I need cock as, like, a frame of reference, you know, to relate to, yeah  And it's like, if a guy's got a huge baseball bat dick and the chick's trying to suck it  Like, uh, it's like she's just chewing on the head of it, you know  Like, I can't fucking dig that, like, I hate it  This has been another wise thought from the magnificent Steve-O  Sirius X 
[02:00:00]  It's the OPNN3 Show  More for the robot band  That's pretty amazing 
[02:00:30]  Little head bombs up and down, that's so fucking funny  I just retweeted this video, if you want to check it out, on my Twitter, OP Radio  But I gotta thank, uh, Nicholad, it looks like  N-I-C-H-O-L-A-D  Turning me on to another song by the robot band  I guess they haven't figured out the vocals yet  No  That's the easiest part, but I don't know  They probably think they're gonna ruin it  Yeah, to have some human element in there, I guess  They should have the guy that, if you hear that sound like this 
[02:01:00]  X-T-N-T  X-T-N-T  It's dynamite  X-T-N-T  Yeah, Stephen Hawking vocals  Yeah, something like that  Why not?  Why not?  Yes  And they don't even care that they're rocking, putting on a show  No  It's just metal  They're really into it  They're like, they're rocking, the crowd is like, digging them, but they don't care 
[02:01:30]  There's no ego there  No ego in a robot  Except an iRobot  Oh, good for Arnold Schwarzenegger, says film violence is not linked to school shootings  Or AI  Huh?  Bravo to Arnold Schwarzenegger  I'm not linked to school shootings  Bye, blah, blah  Good for him  And then he had another incident in Aurora  You saw that, right?  Yeah, a little standoff there 
[02:02:00]  A little shooting  Who'd the guy shoot?  His family?  Was it family members?  Eh, probably  It wasn't one of those random ones, was it?  When the guy should just kill himself  And just fucking let everyone else move on with their lives  What was it?  The wife?  Was it an estranged wife and their kids?  Aurora police killed armed men during standoff who killed three hostages  Were they the only three hostages?  Or  Um, I think his  Was it his wife who jumped out the window to save herself?  Nice 
[02:02:30]  Anybody?  Tuck and roll, motherfucker  Anybody?  I don't know  I'm so, uh  So tired of reading these goddamn stories  Police found three people dead inside a suburban Denver home  On Saturday after a shootout with an armed and dangerous man who opened fire on officers  Twice during a nearly six-hour-long standoff  The gunman was killed by police  Yay  Police  A woman inside the home had been able to escape uninjured  But told police a male inside had fired shots  As she fled, she saw three people who appeared lifeless 
[02:03:00]  Who are the people?  They're believed to be related to the gunman  Of course  Don't family shoot you  That's  Yep  When will we finally be able to eradicate mental illness in this country?  Wouldn't it be great?  Relationship between the gunman and the victims was also still unclear  So maybe it's not family  I bet there's some relationship  Yeah  Ex-girlfriend  Some fucking douchebag that couldn't handle moving on  That's all it is 
[02:03:30]  Yeah  Yeah  Stuck in my head  Stuck in me aid  There you go  Oh, what's this flow thing you were playing?  Oi, motherfucker  I like flow  Who is she?  Yeah 
[02:04:00]  Well, it's a game  You get a board  That was a good one, Sam  No, it was terrible  I'm on the 9x9 board  9x9  So you got a 9x9 board  And you got some colored dots  You got two colored for each color  Now you got to fucking take  See this red dot?  You got to make it to that red dot  Oh  And when you do, look  It makes a little pipe there, see?  Uh-oh, but you don't want to block the other thing 
[02:04:30]  That's right  Because I got to get blue to the other blue dot  But I already blocked it  Because I wasn't thinking up this board  You were doing an example, right?  I was doing an example  And fucked up this board  Now, how on earth would you get that blue one there  And the red one?  Well  Are some of them impossible?  No  Let me show you how I would do that  Right?  How would you do it?  Well, you're making me  I'm not believing this  You're making me think here  Oh, Sam  Yeah, you're so perfect  Sam is marvelous  Thank you  How the fuck am I going to do this? 
[02:05:00]  I don't know  That's creepy  Because you don't want to, like, block the colors  Oh, boy  I don't know  Oh  I really don't know how to do this one  I know  It's like, how would you get the red?  Well, see, I can show you orange  See, orange is pretty easy  Oh, you've got to take that  I see what you've got to do  You've got to take that red  I'm going to go orange all the way around  No, you can't  You can't  You just block the red  You have to take that red down, over, and all the way up  And around the perimeter to get to the other red  I know how to play  I'm actually pretty good at this  Oh, shit  But now I'm on the spot 
[02:05:30]  And this is the hardest board  Flow rules  I might be late to the flow party, but  Go what?  See, you want in on this game  I have no idea  Well, this is the hardest level  That's tough, because green  How do you get the red?  Because you can't split any of the colors, obviously, right?  And I can't go  You've got to go all the way around to be able to get that blue  Yeah, but I can't block the orange  But you can't block the orange either  So go down, down, around the orange  But no 
[02:06:00]  See, because then I split the orange  Wow, this is a really hard board  That's a tough one, motherfucker  That's a tough one  Holy shit  Oh, I got it  Oh, you do  Yeah, I really do  Watch this  Watch and look  Turn your phone off  Watch and learn  Fucking call me a  Shipper  Watch and learn  Too much, fucker  Watch and learn  Watch and learn  Oh, shit, you are all over the place  Hey!  Now I can go blue  Right  But, of course, you've got to get all this covered 
[02:06:30]  Why?  The key is you have to cover the whole board  What?  For it to be official  Oh, that's bullshit  Now the blue's covered  Now the light blue  Is covered  Now we go  That's easy  You have to connect a bunch of dots  I fucked up that  Oh, shit, how do you get out of there?  Well, now I've got to redo that one  You were supposed to go up  Which means I've got to redo the blue  You're supposed to go up with the red a little first, right?  Make a little room  Yeah, you're supposed to do it this way, I bet  Yeah, motherfucker  See  I don't know, that's fucking  I like playing against people  Like words with friends  Chats with friends  Jimmy, you're so old-fashioned 
[02:07:00]  I like something I can sit on the dumper and just play away  As shit falls out of my asshole  No, I know, but you can play against people on that  Man, you can start with that board  That's the big  That's the big 5x5  That's the big retard board  Oh, come on  Easy peasy  But you do a few of the easy boards, it gets you hooked  Gotcha  And then you're in this hell that is the 9x9 board  It's called Flow  Flow  Yeah, Flow 
[02:07:30]  I like Flow  That's my new game  Wow  I played pretty much all day yesterday  While watching football, sort of  Oh  I watched both playoff games  But I couldn't tell you what happened  Because I was just taking a peek every once in a while  They're in the playoffs?  Up from the flow board  No idea  Who's in?  Huh?  Who's in playoffs?  Who's in?  You've still got the Texans  They're going to play the Patriots  Then you've got the Ravens  They're going to be playing the Broncos  Then you've got the Packers 
[02:08:00]  Playing the Niners  And you've got the Seahawks  Playing the Falcons  And we've got some more games, of course  Who is it?  Peyton Manning had a good season?  Yeah  They might give him  MVP  Okay  Or  Comeback Player of the Year  Didn't Ryan Luck do okay to?  MVP?  Huh?  What happened to his knee?  MVP?  Yeah, he kind of pulled his NHL  Ah, here he is  Didn't work the first time  Why are we still trying?  You guys are saying it wrong  That's why  Oh, thank you, Chipper 
[02:08:30]  Colts are out of it, though  Yeah, but I mean  Ryan Luck still did better than they thought  Ravens gave him a beating  Yeah, what happened to the New Orleans Saints?  They're, uh  Who'd that?  What happened?  They got fucked up?  Terrible  Did they?  They had a bad year  Aw  Unless  Unless they're playing a team that really  Has not gotten it done  Where the Cowboys needed to beat them  Oh, the Cowboys  Fucking cocksucker organization  Oh, I hate Jerry Jones 
[02:09:00]  Hate him  You do?  Hate him  What did he do to you?  He fucking destroyed  In the last X amount of years  Any shot I've had at happiness  He chased Jimmy Johnson out of there  Fucking control freak douche  Wow  Just like a similar situation with Woody Johnson  Woody Johnson, yeah  Fucking  Just a baby owner  Who wants to be more famous  Than his players and his coach  Jets are in trouble  They got big, uh  Fucking salaries to deal with  They got  Salaries? 
[02:09:30]  They got to pay Sanchez a shitload  To hold a fucking clipboard  Unless they could ship him off somewhere else  Yeah  And save some of that money  We'll see  You want to hear Letterman on Oprah  Opening up his heart?  Yes  Yes, let's hear that  You really do?  Yeah, I kind of want to hear  You know, we don't know  Letterman being serious?  A lot of the sensitive, real Dave  People in general don't know about Dave  He's been very private  What made him agree to this?  The late night wars? 
[02:10:00]  He's heating up?  You figured he'd get  Maybe  Maybe he's trying to get himself out there a little more  Yeah  Put yourself out there  And he was on Oprah's next chapter  Part of the OWN network  OWN  Which is the same as Oprah  Except not in a TV studio  Yeah  What do you mean?  Just an interview show  Oh, it's in her house  Or whatever  It's like this one was in a recording studio  Instead of a, you know  With an audience  OWN's not in trouble  But I think Oprah's gonna have to bring back  That show of hers  For OWN  Of course  I mean, next chapter is like bringing back the show 
[02:10:30]  Without calling it the show  Yeah, but she needs  Because she doesn't do it in front of an audience, right?  Right  So she needs to bring back the audience  And all that  Screaming she does  Why doesn't she do that?  Because she kind of got sick of it  She was moving on to the next chapter  She was hoping she could have her own TV channel  And do some different things  But she's gonna have to bring back the big show  She doesn't have anything that appeals to anybody  But fucking fat women  How about you realize there's other demos?  And she's gonna have to start with that  David Letterman! 
[02:11:00]  She's gotta start shouting again  Oh, I hate that  Hate that  You hate that?  Travolta came out as the captain  Oh, yeah  Oh, yeah  When he was giving away  They were giving away trips to Australia  And he was gonna fly them there  You're going to Australia!  She needs more of that  You're going to  She sounds like an annoying Twitter person  Yeah, pretty close  So Dave talks about what? 
[02:11:30]  Oh, he tells all  Does he? Does he dish?  Well, I remember he was kind of doing that cheating thing  What?  He had to go on TV and admit the whole thing on his show  Oh, that chick that worked there, right?  Surprise to you  Hey, I don't pay attention to anything  So he talks about how  Talks to Oprah about going out on stage to announce his sex controversy  Oh, right  He had to walk out there  Was that one of the hardest days of your life  When you're standing behind the curtain 
[02:12:00]  Or wherever you stand before you come out  When you know you're going to now  Quote, confess to the country about what has happened  Yeah, it was tough  It was tough  But I will tell you something that  In the back of my mind  This could be an idea  The extent, the breadth and width  Of what a weasel I could be  I was thinking  Eh, maybe I can make this  Maybe I can get a little sympathy out of this deal here  You know  What do you think? 
[02:12:30]  I think I was probably hoping that  Rather than being the actual  The one who was guilty  I thought maybe I could generate some sympathy  So it's not  That's just awful  I didn't do that  Yeah, well, you know  Very honest  Well, you know  That's not that crazy  It's not that crazy  Because that's his  That's the defense mechanism, too  But that's his persona  His TV persona  Which is different than your  Your real life persona  So that's not too far-fetched or crazy, right?  I think whenever anybody's put in that position 
[02:13:00]  You're going to want to try to squeeze as much good out of it as you can  Right  The only crazy thing is like  Yeah, admitting it  Nobody would go  Nobody would admit that  Right  Be honest  Exactly  Dave talks to Oprah about telling his wife  Ofra?  Ofra  Was telling Regina the hardest?  Who?  Well, yeah  I would say  Yeah  That's not a good day  But  You know, here we are  Did you think she'd stay with you?  Through the whole thing? 
[02:13:30]  Don't know  Wasn't certain at the time  Wasn't certain  Wasn't certain at the time  Did you have to sleep on the couch?  I slept a wide variety of  I think Dave has another room  But  Second bedroom  How did you make it?  Yeah  I don't think Dave  I don't think it's either the marital bed  Or the couch with Dave  I think there's a few other fucking rooms  You think when you're Letterman  And you're in the doghouse  You probably have a really nice  Other room  To go to  Other room  It's a dog slash guest house  This is a guy who made a bedroom 
[02:14:00]  In his office at work  Right  I think he probably has  He probably got nice digs  You think he's got nice digs  When he's in the doghouse?  I think he's got some nice digs  Yeah  I guess it's just the living room for me  Well he's trying to puff up the pillow  On the little skinny couch  Pulling a blanket  That doesn't quite cover his feet  He goes to another part of the house  He's never seen before  Yes exactly  Oh there's a bedroom here  Just as cool as the rest of the house  Yes  What a smart guy  To have that bedroom set up  In his office  What a smart guy  Oh man  This way you don't have to 
[02:14:30]  Bring a girl anywhere  She's right there  I'm at work  That's very smart  Oh boy  No one can see you  But  How did you make it better?  I'm still trying to figure it  You think he still has that bedroom?  I don't know man  I bet she comes in and fucking  Comes in with a black light  Just looks for jizz anywhere  There's no bedroom anymore  There's no school beds  That turns up into the wall  Yeah  A Murphy bed  A Murphy bed  Honey I have a army cot  Get rid of it  Get rid of the army cot Dave 
[02:15:00]  He's not even allowed to have a comfortable chair  Yeah yeah  A fucking recliner can only go back  Like 10 degrees  He's got a lot of wooden benches  Around his office  Airplane seat recline  That's always allowed  Kind of how they do it around New York  So the homeless don't sleep on it  Right  Put spikes on everything  Spikes in  Yeah  Put those spikes on everything  Spikes in  Window sills  Spikes  Fucking fire hydrants  They put spikes on  They don't want homeless people  Sitting anywhere  Do people know that  That don't come to New York  No I don't think so  You can't sit anywhere 
[02:15:30]  In New York City  It's almost impossible  Medieval fucking spearheads  On everything  Everything  It's so annoying  Sometimes you're looking around  You're just like  I just kind of want to fucking  Sometimes they'll have something  That might be three inches  And you're like  I think I can get  Like part of my ass cheek on there  To rest for a second  Yeah  Yeah  You just can't fucking sit  But  How did you make it better?  I'm still trying to fix it  It's  It hasn't gone away  It'll never go away  She's been tremendous 
[02:16:00]  She's got great courage  She's greatly intelligent  And  How did you regain  Her trust?  That's what I'm still doing  I'm still doing it  Each and every day  In big ways  And small ways  And get the reward  Of  The nature of a relationship  I never  Experienced before in my life  Nor did I ever think  Was possible  Did it bring you closer?  Absolutely  Absolutely  We went through this together  We have that in common  And  I'm telling you 
[02:16:30]  She  It's great  My life is  Fun  And  Full of joy  Now  That it  I only  Pretended at before  Oh  Is that it?  So how about that?  So how about that?  I don't think Dave's being honest  He's a master though  Of  Like  Easing any tension  That was right there  In that moment  Yeah yeah yeah  Because right after that  He goes  So how about that?  Give me one of these  And he gave her a fist bump  A fist bump  Yeah  He doesn't like  Talking about himself  Ever  No  So this is good  No  This is kind of interesting 
[02:17:00]  Morning mashup people  Walking by  Oh hi  There they are  I don't acknowledge them  Oh  There she is  Bigfoot herself  That was so funny  People pointed out  That we were talking about  Bigfoot  And the lack of existence  Thereof  That day  We proved everyone wrong  And then later in the show  Bigfoot  That bitch got big tootsies  Fucking giant tootsies  It's all I think about  When I see her  All I think about 
[02:17:30]  Dave talks to Oprah about  Not getting  Oh so that's it on the infidelity  So then he moves on  To not getting the tonight show  Ah  Who cares  So many years ago  Right  So many years ago  And he made his own thing  Which is I think even cooler  He's a fucking  If you're number two  In a country of 300 million  You're doing good  Silly  Did you also  Somewhere in your subconscious  Think you would be the heir  Not subconscious  I had a meeting 
[02:18:00]  And they said  We want you to  Take Johnny's job  Yeah that's good  We had a meeting too  That we were supposed to be  Here at Sirius  First  Remember that  Oh right  Remember that meeting  We had  Hey we want you guys  It happens  Especially in entertainment  XM wants you  But Sirius wants you  They want us bad  Why don't you come here  And then all of a sudden  Hey Bob let's talk to Sirius  A little more  Oh what  They're not accepting  Your calls  Yeah they went from  Wanting us bad  To not accepting  Our agent's calls anymore  And the reason was  Because all of a sudden  They were in talks with Howard  Here we 
[02:18:30]  That is true  Yeah  That is absolutely true  So I know what Dave's  Talking about on a  Minuscule level  And then the guy at XM  Didn't really want us  That was wonderful  Oh that fucking piece of shit  Hate him  Hugh Panero  Hugh  Hugh Panero  Pube Panero  Pube Panero  Pube Panero shit  Have we told the people  His opening line in a while  His opening line  I'll never forget  He walks in  And he goes 
[02:19:00]  Look I just want to  Let you guys know  I'm not a fan of your  You guys  I'm not a fan of your show  But I understand why  We should have it on XM  Thanks for the support  Same idiot who thought  Bob Edwards was the big guest  And that was  That's how we started  Our relationship with Hugh Panero  That was his opening line  And then he tried to say  He's not Mel Karmic  Say that again  Yeah exactly  But I don't know  What he was getting at  With that  Like I guess  Mel Karmic  Allowed things with us  Which isn't true  Oh but he was 
[02:19:30]  Going to fucking  He wasn't going to  Take any nonsense  Is that what he was  Getting at  So abso-fucking-lutely  And meanwhile  By not taking nonsense  It was you know  Mel Karmic  Never took nonsense  Of course not  I went upstairs  To say goodbye to him  He left the company  Right before we  Went on break  And he even said it  He's like  Look I never gave a shit  What you guys said  On air about  You know  Me or the  Or the company  Because I know  It's for entertainment  But fucking  Hugh Panero  Never understood that 
[02:20:00]  And these assholes  That oversee our channel  Now  And I'm not saying  Scott Greenstein  I'm talking about  You know  The other guys  They hate  When we talk about them  Yeah they don't get it  They don't get  What we do  And Mel Karmic  Didn't even care  He goes  I just want to let you know  I never cared  About the stuff  You guys said  About me  Or the company  Because I knew  It was for entertainment value  Yeah  Very simple lesson  Right there  You think everybody  Would have figured that out  By now  You would think  No kidding  Fucking radio  But if we talk  To these  Holy shit  If we talk bad 
[02:20:30]  About these low level guys  Everyone gets  A talking to  They love being called  Low level guys  You just did  You did  But everyone gets  A talking to  How is that good  For the show  How is it good  For the show  Because the listeners  Are eating it off  Because they haven't  They have a loser  Fucking boss  That they're trying  To figure out  What he does  For the company  So they relate  Oh boy  Because  Middle management  Is a complete  Waste of time  Oh  It gets in the way  Of everything  Gets in the way  Of productivity 
[02:21:00]  And in our case  Creativity  And walls  Walls  Right  So where were we  Letterman  Talking about  The Tonight Show  Not getting the gig  Johnny's job  Yeah  And here's how  We're going to do it  We just want to make sure  That you're interested  In this  And then we're going  To call the so and so  And then we think  That it'll be a combination  Where you start filling in  And then eventually  Johnny goes up  So they had this conversation  We had two meetings  And I finally said  This is great  I said  Have you mentioned  This to Johnny  And they said  Well no 
[02:21:30]  I haven't mentioned  This to Johnny  And I said  Well  You know  I can't have  This conversation  Until I know  That it's okay  With Johnny  And that's the last  I heard  Oh it wasn't okay  With Johnny  So it wasn't just me  Wanting and hoping  There was a conversation  They had reached out  But  I understand  That what they wanted  Was completely self-serving  They wanted to continue  To maintain the show  So that they could  Make a lot of money  Now what NBC wanted  Turned out to be  Something different  So I really  I can't complain about that 
[02:22:00]  You know  You can't force somebody  To want you  Wow  Wait I don't understand  It sounds like  Johnny fucked him  No  What happened Jimmy  They maybe  They  Johnny wanted him  Johnny did want him  But he said  He talked to the company  And they wanted him  That was just the last  Conversation they had  I can't have  This talk  Until Johnny knows  That was just the last  Discussion they had  Yeah  Carson didn't fuck him  I bet they wanted  Somebody that would  Follow them  And so when  Letterman started saying  Well no I don't want 
[02:22:30]  To do anything  Until you talked to Johnny  Oh they said  Fuck you  Fuck you  Johnny's out  We're the guys  You listen to me  Motherfucker  Iraq wants to comment  On what Johnny's  Last meal was  It was also  Ownership issues  Huh  It was also  Ownership issues  Because Carson  Owned the Tonight Show  His whole library  Everything  If Letterman took over  Through Carson Productions  Carson owned that too  And NBC wanted to own the show  Yeee  Okay  Gotcha  All right  And Johnny didn't  Fuck him  And Jay was willing  To just  You know  I'll do whatever you want 
[02:23:00]  That's fine by me  I'll just  Fucking come here  Tell some jokes  Make a lot of money  He didn't care  No  Why should he  And there was someone  A little bigger  In the company  That decided  They wanted  Leno over Letterman  Yeah  Obviously  Cool  That shit goes down  Dave talks to Oprah  About his rivalry  With Leno  Oh  Okay  So you know  There is an assumption  Over the years  That because you  Didn't get it  And Jay Leno did  That that's where  The rivalry  Between the two of you  Started  Is that true  No  No  That's not true  The rivalry 
[02:23:30]  Jay and I were friends  We were always friends  Before all of this happened  He has a way  He's an unusual fellow  I've never met  Anyone quite like Jay  And I will say  And I'm happy to say  That I think  Is the funniest guy  I've ever known  Just flat out  If you go to see him  Do his nightclub act  Just the funniest  The smartest  Wonderful observations  Just  And very appealing  As a comic  Means clean 
[02:24:00]  Therefore  The fact that he is also  Maybe the most  Insecure person  I have ever known  I could never reconcile that  You're the best  Why are you doing things  To support this insecurity  Everybody thinks  You're insecure too  Not to the degree  This man is  This is the guy  That is documented  As hiding in a closet  While they were having  A business meeting  At NBC  To decide  Who would get the  You think that's true  I was just trying 
[02:24:30]  To hang up my overcoat  And lock the door  I forgot  But then I heard  Some stuff  And I decided  Maybe  But is that  Any more insecure  That's hilarious  Than needing validation  From another woman  Believe me  I get  I get  Letterman's personal life  A lot more  Than I get  Jay's  Because I would  Do the same  Thing he did  Jay is apparently  Very faithful  And goes home  Every night  And there's never  Been allegations  Of that type of stuff  So how is that  One more insecure  Do you know what I mean  It's like 
[02:25:00]  Come on man  As far as hiding  In a closet  If there's a  High powered meeting  Going on about you  And you have a chance  To kind of eavesdrop  I can't  I don't know  That's a ballsy move  To tell you the truth  But I don't know  One person  That wouldn't at least  Try to get  You know  An ear into the  Conversation  Right  That's craziness  He thought he was  Safe in the  Old closet  How did it come out  That he was in the  Closet  Who found out  I don't know  The guy who wrote  The book  Bill Carter 
[02:25:30]  From the New York  Times  How do you know  So much about this  I'm Bill Carter  He's a little  Mr. Late night  He loves late night  Shit  But what did  Jay tell him  That he was  In the closet  How did it come out  Bill Carter  Released the information  I don't know  Exactly how he got it  I want to know  How if Jay  Was the guy  In the closet  No one's with  Jay in the closet  Jay finds out  Info from the closet  If he didn't tell  Anyone he was  In the closet  How did people  Know he was  In the closet  Maybe he called  Someone out  Who was lying  He goes  I heard it  I was in the closet  I heard the  The whole discussion  Something Travolta  Saw him in there  Something about 
[02:26:00]  A closet  A closet  Something about  A closet  There was a closet  In the closet  Dress  In the closet  I was in the closet  Something in the closet  Dress  In the closet  Dress  Something about  Every human being  Is insecure  You don't have to  Just be a comic  And just because  You're successful  At something  And what Dave  Was saying  The best  At what he does  Doesn't necessarily  Mean you're going  To be secure  In that  It's worse  Pryor was the  Best stand up  Ever  And he was a  Fucking insecure  Maniac 
[02:26:30]  Yeah  Of course  Was he the best  Ever Jimmy  Pryor yes  Open for discussion  I would debate  Anybody on that  Simply for social  Relevance  And stuff like that  Sure  Yakov  Yeah but he's  A different  King of Branson  Can't take that  Away from him  Fair enough  Branson Moe  Motherfucker  In the house  That's right  We're having a  Business meeting  At NBC  To decide  Who would get  The Tonight Show chair  I'm not hidden  In closets  Not for that purpose  I've found myself 
[02:27:00]  Sadly in closets  But not for that purpose  Not for that purpose  So your reason  For the rivalry  Is because of  His  Jay's  Insecurity  Well  How it  Manifests  Itself  Yeah  Oh  Sorry  I was waiting  For a follow  Comment  Dave  Comment  There's a part  Two  Dave talks to Oprah  About Jay  And him being  Friends  I just tell you this  When we were all kids 
[02:27:30]  And I do still think  Jay and I are friends  Would he think so too  I think so  Really  I think so  Because I got too much  Fuck that guy  Son of a bitch  Yeah fuck him  When he and I were kids  And somebody would  Go on like the  Merv Griffin show  Yeah  And if you didn't do well  Yeah  Jay would come  Hey did you see Larry  On the Merv Griffin show  No I didn't  Yeah I ain't got a tape  Back at the house  Come on back  Well take a look at it  And he would invite you back  To watch one of our  Fellow comics bomb 
[02:28:00]  And it was just like  Oh Jay stop  That's fucking great  No  Let her man  That's fucking great  That's hilarious  Let's get to know  That goes way back  That's hilarious  That's great  Jimmy and his guys  Would do that  Of course  Do you know  When Jim Florentine  Bombed on MTV  Yeah  We didn't have  You know  Portable phones  And me and  All we did  Me and Levy  Kept trying to catch it  On the MTV thing  To call each other  And see how great it was  That Florentine  Was getting heckled  Off stage  There's nothing better 
[02:28:30]  Than watching a comic bomb  By the way  Is that on YouTube  Anywhere  That's right  I don't know  Florentine  Because you got my  Curiosity  Oh my god  On the Pauly Shore show  Pauly Shore show  Was it  But you gotta think  Letterman was into that  What was he talking about  I love watching  Comedians bomb  I love it  One of our fellow  Comics bomb  And it was just like  Oh Jay stop that  You know  That's  That's silliness  When we did the  Superbowl spot  What two or three years ago  You all hadn't  Like communicated  In years and years  And years 
[02:29:00]  Was that awkward for you  No it was great  Because as he and I  Discussed then  Our way of life  At the comedy store  Yes  Is exactly the way  You would think  It would be  For a group of comics  It was  Tinged with  Sarcasm  And ugliness  And insult  But everybody  Loved it  We thrived on it  We could call  Each other names  We could steal  Each other's jokes  We could make fun  Of each other's girlfriends  And this and that  And this and that  You take that out 
[02:29:30]  Of the comedy store  And all of a sudden  Oh my god  It's civil war  We can't believe it  But the truth of it is  The way Jay and I  Have behaved toward each other  Is the way comics  Tend to behave toward one another  He's softening it a little bit  Huh  Hmm  I don't know  It's very hard  To put yourself in  That position  And situation  And say  Oh no  You should do this  Or you meant that  Yeah  What the fuck  Are we to say  You know  I mean  If you thought  You were going to  Get that deal  For the tonight show 
[02:30:00]  And then you don't get it  And your pal does  You're going to get  Pretty fucking pissed  Quite frankly  They're asking me  To take over  But I'm like  I don't want to do it  Oh Jimmy  Well wait till you get the news  Cause I am  Ha ha ha ha  Ha ha ha ha  I love Jimmy's face  Oh my god  I go  I look at Jimmy  And Jimmy just looks at me  Like ugh  Shut up  Ha ha ha ha  Jesus  I was just thinking  If you were hosting  The tonight show  Oh please right  It would be great 
[02:30:30]  That would be good  Oh please  Fucking band  Would be changed immediately  Ha ha ha ha  The house next door  Late night wars  Gets better  Kimmel starts tonight  Yeah Kimmel starts  So that's  He'll probably do well  Yeah I think he will  I think he'll do well  He's considered  The young upstart  You know  Him and Fallon  He's got that  He's got that new  Type of attitude  I like the way  He incorporates the internet  Yeah he's very current  Him and Kimmel 
[02:31:00]  Very current  Him and Fallon  Excuse me  Yeah  Yeah James Letterman  And Jay still haven't really  Embraced all that social networking  No they're sticking to the classic  Kind of  But those guys really understand  The potential there  Who's his guest tonight  Kimmel  I don't know  It just says Monday's special  It says tonight  So maybe they're doing a whole  Jimmy Kimmel Live's  Goodbye to Midnight  Oh  Oh very cool  So it'll be like a  A huge clip show probably  Or he's got  You know 
[02:31:30]  Secret guests  That he's gonna try to trump  You know  The other shows with  Oh  I'll be good  Oh  I'll be watching  Oh  Tune in  I'll be watching  Indubitably  Mmhmm  Damn  He'll do well  You know  That's the future of it  Of course  Of course he'll do well  It's Kimmel  And then eventually  When Jay retires  I'm guessing  Fallon will step in there  And what about Conan  Poor Conan 
[02:32:00]  On TBS  Very funny  You know what  It's  Yeah  I mean all the people  Who support Conan  If all you guys  In Conan's army  Were watching him  Team Coco  But you're not watching him  Hashtag Team Coco  That's right  Where are they  Where are these  They were just using it  As a dislike for Jay  And as a reason  To complain  And this and that  But he has  Millions of Twitter  Where are  All of these loyal  Not watching TBS  Is he doing alright on TBS 
[02:32:30]  I don't know  He seems to be  Completely buried  Yeah no  Not compared to  No one's talking about  No one's talking about  Team Coco  No one's talking about  If he had just stayed on  Doing his late show  At 1230  He would have had  A much bigger audience  For like two or three more years  Right  He would have gotten  The Tonight Show  And everything would have been fine  Maybe  They must have  You don't know that  I don't know  No I don't know that either  I don't agree with you  I think that was a  Jeff Zucker decision  I think  I think he's always been  A little too quirky  For the mainstream  And he had a good  Fucking  A nice audience  Conan  He didn't have a 
[02:33:00]  Fucking shit audience  He had a  Legitimate  Following  And people loved him  But after 15 years  Everybody kind of  Knows what you do  For good or for bad  So they've made  Their decision already  Whether or not  They like you  And you know what I mean  It's like  You're not going to move  An hour earlier  And all of a sudden  40 million more people  Are going to go  Oh my god  Because they've all seen you  At one time or another  So he had his  Core following  And they were a good  Fucking audience  Yeah  I mean I understand  The desire to move up 
[02:33:30]  And be more famous  Or to be bigger  Or to compete  I mean that's  That's the nature of it  But in that world  There are so few people  Doing it  There's so few people  That you can't  You know  How can you get  So bent out of shape  If you're on a  1230 and on 1130  When there's  What is there  Six shows like that  Just Conan Letterman  Fucking Ferguson  Jay  And who else  Ferguson's pretty funny  I've never seen a show  No  It's pretty funny  Yeah  Oh Kimmel  I think so  I don't watch  Come motherfucker  I can't pick  I can't pick just one 
[02:34:00]  I don't watch  The fuck  Honestly I  I like  I like Letterman  From the real old days  So  I have a soft spot  In my heart  For Letterman always  Old days  Well being  Well being a New York guy  And all that  And you know  I loved watching  When he was on  Late Late  Yeah cause he was doing  Shit that was never done  On TV  Yeah our hours have changed  To the point  I don't really watch  Any of these shows  That much anymore  Yeah  I'll catch a clip here  Here and there  On the internet  Jimmy Kimmel's probably  The best at getting 
[02:34:30]  His stuff out there  Like doing stuff  That people talk about  Well they're internet smart  Because then that's  The people behind the show  To probably know  That you gotta keep it online  Well we have  An internet presence  Jimmy right  What's the last video  That Sirius XM  Put up for us  Let me go check  The Sirius XM  See just when they think  We're not keeping tabs on them  Just when they think  Their web presence  Is embarrassing  No it's good  It's just like Jimmy Kimmel  Let's see what they got for us  Wow let's say  It's gotta be something  Really current  Wait wait don't  What do you think it is  I'm gonna go with 
[02:35:00]  Quentin Tarantino  Yeah  Oh that was a big guess  Django is a huge movie  That was big  And we had Quentin  Sitting right there  Right next to Jimmy  That was big  Go to the ONA section  That would be fine  If it's Tarantino  That'd be great  I don't think it is  It would be a huge face  To me if it's up there  Loading  Loading  Loading  Nothing loads this long  2013  Maybe a big video  Spinning wheel baby  Maybe a big Tarantino video  Round and round  A lot of traffic  Spinning wheel

[02:52:30]  if Mars is listening  to the show  on his fast food  headset  he should come  to the studio  when you little  scamps get together  oh my god  we only have  three clips  on the SiriusXM  YouTube channel  let me check that out  everyone is tweeting  me saying  only three clips  no one goes to  YouTube for videos  what are you talking  about  oh Jimmy  and why didn't we  play the radio wizard  bit this morning  we talked about  them a lot  from the song  contest thing  we did  how many of ours 
[02:53:00]  are up there  well there's one  from two weeks ago  Quentin Tarantino  nice  and before that  gossip guy  before that  okay let me load  load more  wow some audio clips  of Louis C.K.  those were two  months ago  so they took a little  we haven't had anyone  else in huh  in two months  I think  didn't we talk to  the radio wizard  about this shit  do we have  Penn  anything from Penn  he was very entertaining 
[02:53:30]  on the show  Penn was very entertaining  and actually he talked  about school shootings  and all that  which is very topical  so I'm sure we got a clip  so we got Penn right  Willie Nelson  Jason Aldean  One Direction  what's our third clip  one day  I was going to take  a stripper to that show  would have been a bad idea  yeah  boys to men  yeah I don't see Penn  it's the only thing  what's our third clip  by the way  so you got  Louis two months ago  you got Quentin Tarantino  what's our third clip  on the  well I guess  this is  Ricky Gervais 
[02:54:00]  with Jim  and me  but you wouldn't know  that from watching the video  okay  well I think  he's doing a great job  making sure it's all updated  that's good  making sure our best interest  is being met  yeah  Sam so what'd you tell me  in the hall  why don't you tell these guys  well no I want to play the game  I like this  I want them to guess  there's a reason why  Shade 45  wants the Martha Stewart  old studio  a gossipy reason  so who knows  but gossip 
[02:54:30]  oh oh  and of course  we want to just  knock the wall down  behind me  and make a nice  big studio  studio for us  and that would only  get us to where  we used to be  four years ago  exactly  we're not even asking  for more than  what we used to have  no  so it's  this is just  stuff that's up  on the wire  this isn't  you know  right  there's a reason  why they want  to move into  that studio  because they want  to look out  the window  alright  Sam is it  because they want  to look out  the window  according to my  gossip sources  Jim Norton  you are incorrect 
[02:55:00]  how many guesses  they both get  three strikes  alright  they both get  oh yeah  because you know  I love playing games  can you do it up  on the big  gossipy reason  Jim Norton  has one strike  alright  the shade  45 studio  is infested  with roaches  that answer  Anthony  according to my  gossip sources  is  incorrect  dammit  can I guess  one strike  but you know  ah 
[02:55:30]  dammit  because  they want  to do live  performances  in the space  and there's no  room where they  are  I like that  Jimmy's going  with real answers  which I appreciate  oh believe me  mine was real  I swear  I thought  maybe  Jim a well  thought out  answer  yes  definitely  a possibility  yes it was  according to my  gossip sources  yes  that is  incorrect  incorrect  alright  I've noticed  I'm not going to say 
[02:56:00]  who or when  this happened  or anything  there is something  that goes on  with some of the  people here  that work at  shade  I'm going to say  they want to move  because they don't  want to be  next to us  specifically  so they're not  next door  to the Opie and  Anthony show  yes  Anthony  a great theory  and as a matter  of fact  that answer  is  incorrect  yes  because I knew 
[02:56:30]  that would be  incorrect  why  Mr. Know-It-All  because it just  didn't sound  correct  oh okay  you each have  one strike  left  that's one  strike left  why does  shade 45  want to move  into our  brand new space  I'm already  calling it ours  yeah  why  we'll go with  Jim Norton  for his final  guest first  Jim Norton  for the win  go for a real  answer  oh I am  okay  I have to 
[02:57:00]  think now  because  America wants  to know  you've each  got two  strikes  only one  left  why  the shade  45  want to mark  this is as  per the gossip  a video element  to the show  oh no  more conducive  in that  oh boy  Jim wouldn't  that be ironic  if that were  the case  that would be  ironic  because  Jim that  answer is  correct  what 
[02:57:30]  according to my  gossip sources  yo nigga what up  yo nigga what up  according to my  gossip sources  which is the guy  in the orange  t-shirt over there  who would I pay  Mars  Marcelino  Mars step up to  the big boys  table  he works in  he works in engineering  what  wait a minute  he brings an  apple on a plate  I asked for  thank you  you look like  royalty  you wash it 
[02:58:00]  so not only  are we  with his ball  bag  we're not  going to get  that space  they're going to  have a visual  element  which we've been  asking for  for four years  but we want  the visual  element  according to my  gossip sources  which is the guy  standing to my  left  Marcelino  let's hear it  from the horse's  ass mouth  and see why  you have heard  where do you hear  this from  what are you  getting  what kind of  scuttlebutt  are you getting  engineering meetings  you know  what are they  talking about  trains  do these meetings 
[02:58:30]  entail any  kind of  any inkling  that they will  be needing  some hardware  in there  for future  cameras  well what have  you heard  well the request  is  partly the request  is for having  space so they  can do some  camera work  better than  they can  here in  the studio  as soon as  you walk  into studio  12 you have  that little  we have  shitty camera  angles  yes  some of the  worst  that's their  request  one of their  requests  why don't they 
[02:59:00]  just get these  nifty lights  like we got  oh my god  wow  but we want  that  and we're white  it truly is  a whole new  fucking ball game  we're playing  here in this  21st century  I gotta tell you  that motherfucker  I don't think  it's racially  motivated  I think it is  no they haven't  been given that  anyway  what  they haven't  said yes to  them  watch  they will  wait so  they're gonna  get a visual  element before  we get a visual  element  it would appear 
[02:59:30]  that way according  to some of my  gossip sources  do they do their  own visual element  meaning  we'll do our  own visual element  tomorrow let us  sign off on that  we should  it's a big  fucking  well I don't  want to say  money maker  but I know  it would be  I know how  to do that  shit  are you kidding  me we'd make  a shit load  in our pants  that's right  also I did a  little investigating  oh  good show  the morning mashup  is considering  making a push 
[03:00:00]  for that studio  what  oh come on  that's true  I asked them  myself  why I need  more space  to do nothing  I asked them  myself  unfortunately  I think that  my investigating  might have  been an ass  backwards attempt  because they  didn't even know  the studio was  available until  I asked them  about it  so it backfired  on us  well they need  some room  to get in there  and dance  to you know  morning mashup  style  morning mashup  style  maybe they need  more feet  so she doesn't  hit her toes  on the back 
[03:00:30]  wall walking  in the door  see with those  giant heads  big feet  just so you're  aware of the  competition  a foot  what's the  competition  for the  Martha Stewart  old studio  right now  shade 45  is looking at  it so they  can further  their visual  element  which we  have  we have  that same  vision  but we  have dopes  that are  speaking for  us  including our  agent  the second  big competition  right now  is the  morning mashup  who have  officially 
[03:01:00]  thrown their  hat into the  ring as they  call it  their hats  in the ring  everyone  trying to  lay claim  to this  brand new  delicious  studio  by the  sun  yeah we  want to  see what's  going on  out there  I would  assume you're  safe from the  out cue  morning show  since out  cue points in  that same  sunny direction  yes  well action  it does face  way  oh direction  right  the people  trying to  figure it  out at  home  and there's  lots of  furry stools  in the  out cue  studios  they're not  going to  want to  get those  out  what guys 
[03:01:30]  furry  stools  are you choking  I was going to  give you the  heimlich  you're right  the heimlich  went down the  wrong pipe  yeah but I  felt it like  almost apple  went down my  throat  but I thought  it was  saliva  okay  she  almost choked  so as it  stands  you have some  competition for  your studio  you gotta go down  and pitch to 
[03:02:00]  Scott  I'm gonna have  to  oh boy  well I should  probably go now  I think  and pitch  oh man  if you go now  we stay on the  air  you have to  tell us the  results  what happened  oh was that  somebody else  walking down  to take the  studio  I don't know  Jesus  I'm on the  motherfucker  I'm gonna find out  we should put  some police tape  around that thing  not allowed in  Esky Rock  to keep an eye  on that studio  give us a  just throw a roast  in there  well whoever  goes in there  I want their name 
[03:02:30]  and the reason  why they were in there  that's Sal's new job  let's finally give  Sal a job  oh  fuck this up  alright  keep an eye out  for him  there was a guy  in there the last  20 minutes  I'm not even kidding  you think Sal  can handle that  dopey job  no  his new job  is every time  someone goes  into the  Martha Stewart  space  he goes in there  asks their name  who they work for  and why are they  in there  yeah  you think he can  at least do that  or he'll forget  who is it  okay there are people  walking towards the  studio  I just saw them  who is it 
[03:03:00]  I just saw ladies  walking towards  the studio  oh no  who is it  it's the host  that used to have  the show there  they're coming in  to get their stuff  don't let the door  hit chicks  alright  Sal go in there now  someone has to go  in there now  and go wow  and ask him  if this space  is available  not knowing  that they used  to work this way  he just left  oh that's embarrassing  you're going to ask him  if this space  is available  oh my god  that's so mean  they're unplugging 
[03:03:30]  lamps  so they have  the box  with their name  plate on it  and a plant  and a picture  of the family  tell them  those lamps  Opie and Anthony  might want those lamps  see Sal doesn't have  anything to do  this shit  what are these  mustachio douche  what are these  pesky Martha stickers  attached to this window  wait  that was quick  hold on  yeah  Sarah from Buffalo  she's a good egg  she writes  please put a future  home of the  Opie and Anthony  show on the  old Martha  studio door 
[03:04:00]  and tweet that shit  future home of the  Opie and Anthony  show  someone print one  out  and tape it up  immediately  a nice fucking  big  future home  so stay out  under construction  under construction  for all inquiries  and then give like  your number  Sam or something  I'm not putting  my shit on there  we got it to  redirect all  fucking bullshit  back to the show 
[03:04:30]  yeah the boss  told you to do that  so then you could  entertain him and go  oh we're looking  into that  no that's a great  idea  and then they don't  go to the real  people  is Sal in there  now  it's a scam  is he back  Sal  I went in there  and I said  is this studio  available  and there was  three people  and they all  looked so  disgusted with me  that's why we  had you do it  she was like  no  I was like  okay  alright  we want you  to tell her  to leave those lamps  to the Opie and  Anthony show  may need them  you want me  to do that  oh my god  that's a little 
[03:05:00]  lengthy  I don't know  get in there  and do it  he's going  oh  comes back  with his teeth  knocked out  with a fucking  lamp base outline  when I laughed  my ass off  holy fuck  who's interviewing  Precious  I don't think  that's Precious  are they going  into our studio  no  they're going  right into  shade  they made the  turn  maybe that's why  there's no room  in that fucking  studio  all you women  are so fat  how big can you  make that future  home of the  Opie and Anthony  show  well  I have to 
[03:05:30]  be careful  because  what kind of  font do you want  to use  not comic sans  that's way  no that's funny  look at this  that's official  looking  yeah  that's like  not welcoming  at all  and you got  a picture  of  I put up  a picture  of a cartoon  of Jim Norton  flipping the bird  that's perfect  that's perfect  is this attached  to printers  print  oh please  why would it be  yeah prints in color  do you have a  do you have a  cereal port plug  sounds back  yeah I said that  and they just  oh very funny  and then I was like 
[03:06:00]  okay and then I  turned around and left  they are so pissed  off at me right now  I can tell  well they lost  their job  I think  yeah  so that was  a future home  of the Opie and Anthony  that's a little selfish  can you make a lot  of those signs  Eric I'm going to  email this to you  and make at least  20 of them  and put it all  on the glass  all the way around  it alright  I'm going to  email this to you  Eric I'm going to  need you to go  ahead and print it  can you do that  for me buddy  yeah I'm going to  need you to go  ahead and print  this  and E-Rock  will tweak this  shit when he's  done  yeah  show him in the  studio with our

[03:10:30]  vying for the studio  it's gonna be fucking  race war  race war  why did you have to  bring it to race again  because it's a race war  because we're white  and they're black  where's Gary  I was on Shade 45  this weekend  again  fight fight  please that isn't  really a fucking  where's Gary  he's right outside the door  oh what's he doing there  bring Gary in  let's bring Gary in  yeah let's talk to Gary  Gary  yes  please step up sir  from common to incompetent  step up Gary  how are you sir  how was the weekend  how are you 
[03:11:00]  nice good actually  pretty goddamn good  what's going on  with our wall issue  with your wall issue  yeah  were you aware  that we wanted to  yeah absolutely  when were you aware  when were you aware  late last week  oh that's interesting  I think you probably  because we've been aware  three and a half years ago  but now  but now an opportunity  has arisen  yeah  one that you know  it's like  it's like  the heavens opened up  that there's a studio  right next to ours  that is now vacant  and merely tearing down  a wall  and making a few  extra little plugins 
[03:11:30]  here and there  a little move  and this and that  and we have the studio  that we've needed  for quite some time  by the way  that's the sign  that's the sign  that's the sign  that's going up  in the studio  I like that a lot  excellent  so we were just wondering  what  is the projection here  what do you think  based on your tenure here  what do you feel  will be the end result  of our  putting in a bid  for that studio  oh I don't ever guess  on things like that  oh okay  it'll be a challenge  it'll be a challenge  why does shade want it 
[03:12:00]  oh I don't know  anything about shade  oh  but why would it be  a challenge  if it's something  that actually  isn't it obvious  we need more  studio space  of course  so what's your plan  for us to have  a bigger studio  what is my plan  yeah you're kind of  overseeing this  don't you  so if it's obvious  your show needs  bigger space  what's your plan  we've made that  effort for years  Mr. Wizard  tear down this wall  yes hello  so what are they  going to use that  studio for  if it's not 
[03:12:30]  to make us happy  I'm going to find out  there's four candidates  that I've heard of  what  four candidates so far  oh  maybe we'll have  a lottery  like the 1D tickets  that worked out well  I know  alright  but well  this just seems to me  like something  that would be  perfect  it's not a studio  across the way  I call it a no brainer  no brainer  it's the no brainer 
[03:13:00]  and if anyone knows  no brainers  it's us  yes  doesn't sound like  a compliment  so you're not  going to be able  to get anything  we take the wall down  we're in  so who are you  going to talk to  about this  I'll talk to Scott  talk to engineering  talk to  we take the tapes  to the record company  we get the record  contract  hello exactly  hello exactly  yeah  alright  obviously nothing's  going to happen  no  not with that  attitude Opie  that's true  they're going to  give it to Shade  and they're going to 
[03:13:30]  wind up using the  oh no  do you think  they're going to  build the  hallway extension  did you understand  the hallway extension  do we have a solution  to the spinning wheel  problem  yeah that's already  been fixed  let's see what's  up there now  it's probably Tarantino  let me check it out  go refresh  ah ok  they didn't put  Pendulet up there  there it is  alright  Quentin Tarantino  before that was  Chris Tucker  with Ron Bennington  oh ok  and Louis CK  Louis CK  that's months ago 
[03:14:00]  and Jay Moore  I see it in there  Jay Moore  Jay Moore went home  months ago  the redheads  outnumbering the  brunettes  in that shot  right there  what about Pendulet  Gary Oldman  Gary Oldman  that was like  a year ago  oh Chris Rock  that was a long  time ago  Anthony Bourdain  that was a long  time ago  haven't we had  guests on since  what about Oliver  Stone  that was recent  ah that was a  good one  did they shoot  a video of that  I don't know  if they did  I know  of course  what they put 
[03:14:30]  on YouTube  was  people don't  think you're  real by the  way  they think  we invented  this character  how do you  not know  we don't have  Oliver Stone  video  you should have  saw Jimmy's  face  is your neck  ok  we have it  right  Jimmy went  like this  with his  neck  say what  yeah we do  they put  town hall  clips  he did a  town hall  so the web  team put up  clips from the  town hall  we're not here 
[03:15:00]  to talk about  Oliver Stone  or video clips  we're here  to focus  on the  wall  there's  three other  groups  trying to  get the  wall  and we  need to  make sure  that we're  on top  of it  well  Gary will  be representing  us today  right  absolutely  aka  radio wizard  like the  dream team  for OJ  going there  representing  right  yes  if it  does not  fit  well  I don't  give a  shit  unfortunately 
[03:15:30]  we have  Darden  of all  the great  lawyers in  that case  we have  Darden  all right  good luck  to you  Gary  thank you  for coming  in  I like  the fact  that Gary  comes in  at least  he comes  in  now  I like  that  yeah  very good  yeah  yes  indeed he do  enjoy the rest  of the day  I will give it  a whirl  take a tizzy  Roland  you gonna give it  a whirl  yeah  what are you  a whirly bird  it spins me 
[03:16:00]  right  right  Roland  yes  what are you  hearing about  talent  wanting that  space  my money's  on them  on what  on the talent  department  why don't they  have like  other places  to go  they don't have  a bigger room  to do them in  what do they need  because you have  a lot more guests  what are the guests  going to do in there  they'll have like  different DJs  rotating  I'll tell you this  wait what  I'll tell you this  isn't there other  places for that  of course  the talent department  thing bodes well  for the morning  mashup 
[03:16:30]  getting it  because what  they would do  is they'd stick  the morning  mashup in there  for the three  hours  let them do  their show  and then  that's the  mashup studio  but the talent  department gets it  the rest of the  day  but what does  the talent  department need  with another  studio  what do they do  for more guests  and space  but what do the  guests do  they talk to  people  they're saying  that a lot  of times  you'll have  big guests  come in  and people  interview them  like when I  have an interview  I don't do  the interview  in here  yeah but  there's plenty  of studios  there's not  there's a  shortage  what  well that's 
[03:17:00]  not our  problem  that's right  opie  yeah  that's one  thing  because our  shortage  is the fact  that we have  a small studio  right  we have a  shortage  on legroom  that's right  all right  why don't we  do line of  the day  I swear  people ask  me if  Gary's real  they think  it might be  something we  invented  like a goof  character  because they  can't believe  this guy  is actually  in charge of  anything  we use  cactus  how many  runner-ups  we got there  two runners-up  two runners-up  two runner-ups 
[03:17:30]  you dummy didn't  know to say  runners-up  or runner-ups  yeah  it's not two  runners-up like  mothers-in-law  but the rbi  thing  yeah  now they're  saying seven  rbi  instead of  seven rbi  rbi  is better  i like rbis  better too  rbis  have a rippy  a rippy  so are we  doing runner-ups  or runners-ups  either one  runner-ups is  how it would  you think  of course  it used to be  rbis though  it's definitely  runner-ups  when you  when you  when you make  it an acronym  then you can  put the s  at the end  because the  acronym becomes  the word 
[03:18:00]  right  it's no longer  like an  abbreviation of  runs batted  in  it's rbis  right  that's why  you could  say it like  that  but but  runners is  ups  that's different  for those sports  announcers with  their five rbi  just safe  we all grew up  with rbi  right  that's right  there  first runner-up  they're asking  me to take  over but i'm  like i don't  want to do  oh jimmy  well wait  till you get  the news  because i am  i love jimmy
