<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts using vulgar language to describe their show and satellite radio. They immediately discussed the severe New York City weather, threatening co-host Jimmy Norton's flight to North Carolina for a show, with 40 mph winds and potential for 5-6 inches of rain prompting consideration of alternative travel.  A large portion of the show focused on the recent death of comedian Greg Giraldo.  Norton, close to Giraldo, shared his grief, recounting an emotionally charged taping of *Raw Dog* the day before Giraldo's death where they unknowingly touched upon his health.  Anecdotes about Giraldo's personality, comedy, and struggles were shared, along with mentions of surrounding rumors, though speculation was avoided.  The hosts discussed the reaction from other comedians and friends.  They then transitioned to a discussion about a bed bug infestation in their SiriusXM building, affecting even Howard Stern. The reliability of bed bug-sniffing dogs was debated, alongside humorous anecdotes about the situation and management's reaction.  Various other bugs and pests were also discussed.  A segment detailed a prank video featuring Stevie, a jumpy individual.  The show concluded with brief mentions of upcoming live shows and further personal anecdotes.


The discussion of Greg Giraldo's death continued, with hosts and callers sharing anecdotes and memories. The circumstances surrounding his death, initial reports, and the lack of clarity were discussed.  The conversation broadened to death, funerals, and wakes, with callers offering darkly humorous observations. Gilbert Gottfried's tweet about Giraldo's death was mentioned, along with other comedians like Carrot Top and Lindsey Lohan.  The hosts shared their experiences with death and grief, recalling Manny Dworman.  Comedian Jim Jefferies joined the show in studio.  A significant portion focused on Jefferies' health issues due to excessive alcohol consumption, including an enlarged liver and blood in his stool.  He discussed his struggles with alcohol abuse, his (temporary) decision to quit drinking, and performing while intoxicated.  His use of prescription drugs and past psychedelic experiences, particularly with mushrooms in the UK, were also discussed.  The conversation included many tangents, such as his mother monitoring his online presence and experiences in Amsterdam. Dr. Steve was called to offer medical insights on Jefferies' liver and the effects of different substances.


The conversation with Jim Jefferies continued, focusing on his decision to quit drinking because of potential liver damage. Dr. Steve provided medical advice and humorous commentary, often making off-color remarks about Jefferies' lifestyle and eating habits.  A caller, Steve from Connecticut, shared his substance abuse struggles and sought advice from Dr. Steve. The discussion touched on the lives and deaths of comedians like Chris Farley and Greg Giraldo.  Jeffries detailed his sobriety struggles, joking about wanting to return to drinking and his self-destructive tendencies. The conversation became extremely vulgar and sexually explicit, covering hangovers, sex, masturbation, and bodily functions.  A significant portion focused on a bet about the size of intern Stevie's penis. The hosts and Jefferies made crude jokes and comments about Stevie's appearance and sexual experiences.  Other listener calls and off-topic discussions ensued, including the dangers of various diseases, the struggles of young comedians, and humorous anecdotes from Jefferies' life. The segment ended with a failed attempt to measure Stevie's penis against a Red Bull can.


The show continued with a discussion heavily focused on penises, sexual experiences, and STIs, particularly warts.  Boasting about penis size and pictures led to reminiscing about the technological evolution of sharing such images â€“ from film to fax to smartphones.  The hosts discussed the perceived increase in "slutty and sleazy" behavior due to modern technology. A guest recounted an unwanted anal encounter with a transvestite prostitute in Amsterdam. A physical altercation erupted between Stevie and Jason Ellis, described as a "retards' schoolyard fight" involving punches.  The "dog collar challenge," involving shock collars and remote controls, was the main event.  Various guests participated, with humorous reactions. Jim Jefferies, nervous and hesitant, became a central figure.  The segment concluded with discussion of the dog collar challenge, the altercation, and plugs for Jason Ellis's upcoming events, including "Ellismania 6," a boxing event featuring shock collars and blindfolded fighters, and his movie, described as involving violence, gore, and a man with a large penis and a snake in his anus.


A discussion about online hate directed at one of the hosts began, spurred by a caller mentioning fans wanting a host to die.  This led to a discussion of online negativity and receiving hate from purported fans.  The hosts discussed a previous "dog collar challenge," with one jokingly conceding defeat.  Guest Jeffrey promoted his upcoming comedy shows at Caroline's Comedy Club.  The hosts bantered with Jeffrey, making plans for him to attend a show and discussing the performance schedule. The segment concluded with thank yous and goodbyes, with the overall tone informal and profane.

[00:03:30]  five-year deal all this crap we haven't signed anything yet yeah yeah so there's your update  that everyone was begging for yesterday uh jimmy how you doing man okay um i didn't know  gerald as well as you did and and patrice and the rest of the gang yeah i mean i ran into him like  everyone else at the cellar and he came in here and he was uh just a really bright intelligent guy  uh really funny guy yeah one of my favorites actually he was great i loved his shit and uh it's just a 
[00:04:00]  really sad day sucks i mean it's it's where we taped raw dog yesterday because my show airs today  and it was vinnie who was on me bobby and vinnie and we talked a little bit about greg um but he was  you know he's alive it was like we're like we don't know what's gonna happen and it's so odd  but you're foreshadowing a little bit no i mean it was a tape show right before today yeah before we  found out about greg but vinnie didn't want to go into great detail i think he got too emotional he  you know he's just i could see when he talked about it was too much so we we just kind of like 
[00:04:30]  yeah well let's hope he's okay and a few hours later oh i see the od already happened oh yeah this  was yesterday about uh we taped it yesterday after the show for today to run today wow so i'm debating  it's an odd thing to have but it seems creepy to just run me uh bobby and vinnie talking and laughing  without mentioning greg right like by cutting it but it seems weird to to leave it in where it's  it's almost depressing more depressing to hear hey well let's hope he's okay and it's like 
[00:05:00]  yeah they're doing a tribute to him on raw dog today so maybe i don't even know if they're gonna  air my show they might just maybe they'll just go with that all day maybe which would probably  the great gerald our tribute all day today on raw dog comedy series 104 xm 150 i'm sure that's starting  up very soon so you never want to be the subject of a tribute yeah that's very rarely are you still  alive when a tribute happens i think everyone was worried about him yeah and i thought i thought  he was well i don't know i don't know i don't know i thought he was doing better you know he looked 
[00:05:30]  great when he was uh uh one of the judges on last comic standing yeah and i was happy for him like  man this is a great spot for him he looks like everything's coming together for him i know and uh  you just it's like everybody who knew him you always were worried about this you know what i mean  it's like you know the friend who do drinks to him whatever it is you know what it is it's like  you're always worried you're gonna get the call or and he was doing good and then he wasn't then he  was doing great and it's like you never knew with greg how he was doing because he always greg was a  healthy guy like he was uh you know you could never tell by looking at him like oh he doesn't look 
[00:06:00]  well like greg always looked like he was healthy so if he was pretty cool at the moment you never would  know where he was at unless he told you right he was usually very honest about it yeah he he was pretty  honest on our show yeah you know what he was dealing with so he's a funny guy maybe he's a  really good comic and it's just you know he was a nice guy he had three sons it's just it stinks  it's hard and it makes you angry yeah as a friend you get it's like as a friend you get angry at  your friend like what the fuck dude you know what i mean it's it's the way when you see a friend 
[00:06:30]  fucking up you get mad at him so that's what you know it's depressing very depressing obviously  yeah it's horribly horribly sad so but uh you know it's funny people always say like i don't tweet  really melodramatic things at all i just said you know he's my friend and he whatever i treated i  treated the picture of us um i was debating it because i got a call from bob yesterday we did  the show and then uh i talked to vinnie after and he said that he was really in bad shape like worse  than i had thought i didn't realize what he was and maybe it took a turn you know how this shit goes 
[00:07:00]  man it's like and then uh i got a call from bob later as soon as i saw my cell phone ring i just  knew i was like fuck i hate answering my cell phone but i kind of had to answer that one  sure and uh he told me and he said kyle had called him and i think kyle had heard from the  family so i looked online i saw that nick had posted to paulo right and nick obviously got a  call he was very close to him it's uh on his facebook right which kind of confirmed it for  me like oh of course it's not a mistaker yeah you posted a nice picture of you and him at a wedding 
[00:07:30]  when was that wedding that was in uh june um it was noam uh is manny's son who owns the cellar  and he got married in uh june 28th that where tom papa actually fucking did the wedding and they  actually had him certified you know right marriage ref thing right and uh gerald and his girlfriend  were there and you know it's funny after i posted that somebody sent a photo from because he hosted  the nasty show in july so we did a bunch of shows in montreal together and somebody posted a picture  of all of us uh yeah it's kind of a homoerotic little photo greg always took really homoerotic 
[00:08:00]  photos i found one from a few years ago i'm kind of lurking behind him like a small young lad  and uh somebody sent me one of the uh the nasty show that we did uh which was me bobby voss greg  uh this girl tiffany haddish and bobby slayton it was a good shot i'll post that yeah right on  it looked like he could grow a beard in for three hours dude i i fucking i didn't realize he shaved  that morning in that shot we're looking at he really he's colombian he's got the biggest five  o'clock shadow you'll ever see yeah he was like he had that latin male thing yeah and he had a temper 
[00:08:30]  too i saw gerald a couple of times yell at people yeah oof yeah he didn't play fucking games man  i really you never want to be on the fucking business end of a gerald scully it was creepy  because you know tmz they uh posted a picture of uh gerald hanging out at the stress factory  and they're calling it the last picture of greg gerald oh maybe it was and he looks pretty good  in the picture and i guess later that night whatever happened happened i don't know i don't  know either it's like you hear so many details i don't know what rumors are true that's why i haven't  speculated because he's my friend and it's like you don't want to say something you know that's 
[00:09:00]  gonna i i like i kind of i know his family so it's like i don't want to say anything you don't  want to be irresponsible anyway but i don't want to say anything stupid and all of a sudden be wrong  and be the asshole whose name is attached to saying something sure about my buddy sure of course um  but it's he shouldn't have died i mean it's like you know it's like one of those things it was like  let me see that was the last picture of supposedly taking off the stress factory after one of the shows  maybe it was poor greg typical comedian's luck it's with three guys right isn't that just that's just a 
[00:09:30]  comic's fucking luck right three dudes guys wearing flannels guy and one guy's a pink hat on  and a fucking yellow thing on his wrist jesus if he could sit here and fucking see that he would  not want that to be his last photo some chick with giant tits baby some cool stage photo  it's just a comedian's fucking luck i mean was he was he clean jimmy i don't know i mean he told us  he was clean when i was one of the last uh times he was on the show he was i think he was honest  about it like when i would see greg i would never it's weird when you're sober you don't i don't 
[00:10:00]  preach to people i don't uh try to make them do what i think they should do because you drive people  away doing that it's like here's what i think you should do right it's not my place we he knew i was  a sober person we had talked many times and he knew i was here for him so i would see him and i would  go hey man how are you you good and we both knew what i was asking him and uh in those times where i  hadn't seen him he'd go yeah great or he'd go you know you know and that meant that maybe he wasn't  as good as i would like him to be but he didn't want to talk about it and i have to respect that 
[00:10:30]  sure but uh it was hard to get a read montreal because he was very busy too we did 14 it was a  fucking we did a lot of shows in montreal two a night and three a night thursday friday so it's  hard to tell what kind of state somebody's in when they're actually in the dressing room reading notes  and you know but he was performing was great so it wasn't like i would watch him perform and go  that guy's uh he was fucking brilliant man he was a funny fuck yeah really funny guy  this shit just scares the hell out of you huh yeah it's because you never think it's going to be 
[00:11:00]  your friend it's like gerald is a really a rough one because i know him really well for a long  fucking time it's not you you never it's always the other guy it's always like oh that that singer  it's you know some performer that you don't know but once a guy you know it's like it just seems  like not real i still can't really wrap my head around it i'm like i know it's true but it's like  kind of in shock a little bit well yes and no i mean i knew it was coming but you know it's just  it's just a it's a rough one to wrap your head around for a little while i think you know you  guys hang out at the cellar last night yeah people that don't know when these guys aren't performing 
[00:11:30]  you know across america their hometown club for the most part is the comedy cellar in the village yeah  i think most of you most of you guys would say just that oh yeah that's your hometown club so you  know what's nice and if you guys ever you know make it to new york city you go down the comedy  cellar on a tuesday a wednesday sometimes a thursday you see all these guys just hanging out  doing sets and uh just kind of working on their craft before they hit the road for the weekend  so i would imagine yesterday there were a lot of the guys down there just kind of 
[00:12:00]  hanging and talking yeah i mean uh again i haven't talked to kyle i want to call him um but it's  just gonna be a sad conversation you know what i mean it's like you try to avoid as much do you guys  ever have sad conversations yeah and we talk about everything not often though right it's because  comics have a way of handling things we're not a it's like we're comfortable with sad things in a  weird way like we're comfortable we talk about all this rotten stuff in our personal i mean the  the name i've been working under at the comedy cellar is the guy who's bob kelly's stepfather who used 
[00:12:30]  to beat him no really you know what i mean and that was you know and bob knows that i mean that's how  we are with each other so right um if gerald had pulled through we would have given him a comedian's  beating it's what we did so we would all talk about it but it was very sad last night and uh the  only you know tom pop i saw and a lot of guys i didn't see though but it might have come in later  i don't know i didn't see colin i didn't see patrice or nick or other guys i would have wanted  to see but i saw keith just miserable and a lot of the people there having a few drinks and you know 
[00:13:00]  they're just gonna and i just left i had to pack and i wanted to eat and i was just very very  depressed like you just wanted out yeah i tell it he were very i know dave's probably bummed today  too they were really good friends right yeah for a long time wow it's just you know you don't know  what to say no i mean and it's because it's it's a part of it is when it's your friend um it's it's  annoying you get you get annoyed at your friend for fucking up it's as simple as that you know you  get annoyed at your friend all right how's vinny doing i think he's okay he was very sad you know 
[00:13:30]  vinny's a mush like the rest of us you know he's a nice guy he's a vinny owns the stress factory for  the people uh that don't know where giraldo was uh performing yeah didn't make his didn't make his  last uh performance which was what saturday night saturday yeah so all this went down on friday i  guess after maybe he performed yeah and i don't know when it actually happened it was sometimes saturday  it's so many sketchy i guess whenever it's something like this there's police involved they have to see  what make sure it was nothing shady sure they don't release details well they keep saying there was a 
[00:14:00]  party in his room i've heard that wasn't true see that's the thing yeah that's that's why you  don't want to bring any of this shit up i guess yeah it was probably probably happened i'm i'm gonna  speculate that uh there was people in the fucking hotel there was probably something going on and  they attributed to giraldo's room but from what i knew about greg i just can't picture him having a  bunch of people in a hotel room i never drank with him so i don't know right right but i can't picture  him having a bunch of people yeah but um he was funny he was a funny he's a great comic 
[00:14:30]  great comic fucking uh you know and he had nice his sons were very nice i haven't seen them in  years but they were nice boys he had a good family how old are the sons i don't remember one the one  the last time i saw one uh young greg uh his greg jr was uh i want to say 2004 as tough crowd was  ending on the set i was violently ill that day so i couldn't i was gonna you know shake his hand or  pat his head but i want to get him fucking sick so i'm gonna say it's about five or six years since  i've seen him he's probably 14 now wow and uh he has two younger kids that's what's frustrating 
[00:15:00]  and it's like you know dude but that's how it is for most people most people who are in that  partying you know what i mean it's how it goes man it's most people don't i think fulfill their  potential they don't live as long as they should seems like it happens to a lot of comedians too  huh yeah i think comics have a longer shelf life than most even i mean musicians drop dead every  fucking eight minutes right comics do but i think that the fact that we get the bile out  and the fact that you are always attacking what you hate so much there is something that really is 
[00:15:30]  healthy about that because you don't build it up sure you could just whether it's politics or your  wife or your friends you just you get it out on stage um which helps i think it really does it's  like it's attention release so i think comics probably have better luck with their hearts  all right but people it's funny what people are they asked me for a statement yesterday and it's  it's weird it's like and i gave one and i said something nice about my friend it's like right um  but people mean well but some of the melodramatic things well we say it was just well we got one on 
[00:16:00]  instant feedback oh this guy means well too yeah sir we know you mean well and and i'm sorry ahead  of time uh david in san bruno california david i really am sorry ahead of time because uh obviously  this is how how you're dealing with it he writes uh mr carlin mr pryor mr hicks take care of our  friend greg he really meant a lot to us and we're all gonna miss him terribly tell him that we loved 
[00:16:30]  him the world's not as funny now um i can't even get oxygen in who was that what's his name uh let me  see here david uh hetchum we know you mean well david and that was a very nice sentiment right but in  mr pryor mr hicks how about mr kevorkian please call david you never have to get feedback like  that again well what are you supposed to do i know you know what i mean you want to say something  really nice and then the party wants to fucking write jokes i think the easiest thing to do is 
[00:17:00]  just to do r.i.p man yeah just go r.i.p yeah it's a safe one no one's gonna call you out on it  i don't you're expressing what you're thinking i don't say thoughts and prayers just i'm telling you  that danza stuff we used to do ruin me although i am thinking of his i have been thinking of his  family a lot the last that's what makes this one a lot harder because uh there's there's three sons  without a father today yeah you know that's that's rough it's this is not a you know a guy that you  know didn't have a family yeah and uh makes it a little rougher he was a respected guy he really 
[00:17:30]  was a respected guy man i mean comics never you couldn't badmouth greg as far as you just  couldn't he was a nice guy but i mean as a comic we love to fucking badmouth each other we love it  right you know when guys get a lot of tv opportunities you know you want to find what's  wrong with him but he was just a prolific guy he always had new shit he always had a really really  smart angle he was not a predictable guy at all um you you couldn't not like him as a performer 
[00:18:00]  you could not not respect him so yeah it stinks we were so happy too because we watched that last  comic standing and he was he was shining bright man he was shining bright and i'm thinking here  we go you know uh geraldo getting his shit together and he's getting the shot that he deserves  this is going to lead to other things obviously because he really did well on that show this past  summer yeah and it was you know again you were always happy to see a guy like him or andy kindler  too who's a right comedian's love and he's been around for a long time he's funny yeah i didn't know 
[00:18:30]  the woman who was on with him i didn't know her but yeah you see those two guys getting a shot  you know it's like a lot of them should have less a lot of the last comic guys will say something  the contestants right will say something they'll mean well but they didn't really know him of course  it was good in an elevator once he thumbs up to me really well uh we got a greg giraldo bit we  could play we'll take an early break today maybe do a couple minutes of greg giraldo so i don't know  what to do with that raw dog shorts i really don't i don't want it to be in i don't like to edit out  stuff that was said but i'm debating it because it just sounds depressing yeah but you know what 
[00:19:00]  is it in bad taste no no no we did i say air it yeah maybe we will unless again in some weird way  it's in bad taste now because i know you don't go down that road of bad taste like that but if you  feel like it's not in bad taste i would i would run it because it's a real moment yeah i mean not  everything is about the laugh sometimes people like you know listening to real moments i don't mind that  i just feel bad i was talking it's like so quick after like 24 hours later or six hours later i knew 
[00:19:30]  right he was dead right and he was probably he might have been dead when we were talking about  that but we were just saying like yeah i hope he's okay you know he's like you just hope you keep  him in your yeah it was like the optimism is what bothers me you know i mean we didn't say anything  bad about him but yeah i i that's that's where i'm at if you don't think it's in bad taste i say  you run it yeah maybe because it's a moment you know you guys were having a moment with the whole thing  yeah it was it was a funny show too yesterday we had fun with me vinnie and bob you know again guys  you know for a long time sure sure sure so i'm babbling at this point but i love greg and it's 
[00:20:00]  terrible it's terrible yeah we loved having them on the show i loved seeing the seller that when he  talked about that fucking being on a plane and pat and it's amazing how you know somebody but we  never drank together and when he told that plane story about being on an airplane and uh being paranoid  thinking they were talking about that was fucking hilarious do we have that queued up any way we can find  that real fast no all right we'll play we're gonna play a lot of uh greg giraldo clips today we can  find that was a funny one so travis will take us to break with something from greg giraldo and uh 
[00:20:30]  watch him fuck up and play greg gutfeld and we'll continue uh opie and jimmy anthony on his way stay  there you know it seems to be a lot easier these days like even my my friends are going on these  computer dates all the time and that used to be for losers that used to be for fucking losers now  everybody goes on the computer just types away i know guys going out with five six different women a week  like hot women from the computer you know and it's just my luck i get married and they come out  this great new way to get laid it's a i feel like a guy who got polio a week before the vaccine came out 
[00:21:00]  it's it's just not easy and every couple fights we all fight everybody in here fights it doesn't  matter your age younger couples slightly older couples cowboy couples everybody fights right  everybody fights and we've all had the same fights and you know exactly the fights i'm talking about  exactly the ones i'm talking about you know the one where you're bombing in an empty club  in wheeling west virginia and some toothless douche in the front rows like you ain't from around here  are you boy and you're like did you really just say that you cliche slobbering mongoloid halfwit 
[00:21:30]  people still say inbred cracker ass shit like that you ain't from around here are you boy and he's  like man you suck you ain't funny at all and you're like hey don't be mad at me because you caught  your rat tail in the tilt the world at work today fuck base all right i didn't i didn't uh  i didn't tell you to drop out of high school and eat rock candy 15 hours a day for the last 15 years  i'm pretty sure you came up with that approach to life all by your own inbred cousin fucking self  you know and he's like man i'm gonna kick your ass why don't you kick my ass then motherfucker 
[00:22:00]  right so you get off stage you start doing shots of tequila just to numb the pain and then you're on  the phone with your wife and she's like are you drunk you're like yeah i'm drunk i'm in west virginia  i'm gonna i'm gonna stay drunk the whole goddamn time i'm here well i hate you gotta go on the road  and get drunk all the time well i hate going on the road too my love but i'm just trying to earn a  goddamn living here okay and if getting drunk is the only way i can anesthetize myself enough to  entertain a bunch of freaks that i have nothing in common with i would have thought you the person  who supposedly loves me for me would be on my side just one time and try to show one fucking little 
[00:22:30]  bit of compassion well i uh i never would have married you if i knew you were gonna go on the road  and get drunk and work in nightclubs i wouldn't have married someone like that yes you would have  because that's how we met in the first place remember and remember i said i wasn't going to  change my lifestyle which is why i said we shouldn't get married but you pressured me to get married  anyway because you women are fucking psychotic lunatics that that can't leave well enough alone  it's always like where are we going with this where are we headed where's this going where's the 
[00:23:00]  next step where are we going what's this working toward we we got to take another step we got to show  more commitment we got to go even further than we are right now where's this headed and then once you get  your hooks in someone you take what you originally found appealing and attractive about him and you  try to mash it the fuck right out of him so you turn him into a neutered little puppy dog which is  subconsciously what you really wanted in the first place have you had that one a lot yeah it's the  same shit right years ago i came home drunk on my motorcycle i know that was stupid but i had to 
[00:23:30]  pretend i wasn't drunk which is impossible and we have one of these loft beds so i gotta climb up in  the loft bed and pretend to be sober and she could see right through it you know i'm talking too loud  and i'm slurring i'm still wearing my helmet that's not gonna fool anybody laying in bed buck  ass naked with a big full face helmet on my head i ain't drunk honey i thought we could play alien space  fantasy invaders  and now the opian anthony show serious 
[00:24:00]  it's the opian anthony show 
[00:24:30]  starring little jimmy norton who's gonna be on a prop plane and 40 mile an hour winds  five to six inches of rain in the new york area and if you're hoping to get out of new york early  jimmy that's not happening because the storm's coming from where you're going oh good that should  be a shitty travel day for you so i'm gonna be following you on twitter today  i uh you're gonna be tweeting your anger i'm wondering if we can get a i don't get mad when it's  weather i understand like why they can't take off i'm more nervous because uh  why why can't we just i'm gonna have can we look at trains early because it's not like it's florida 
[00:25:00]  where you have to you can drive to north carolina you can't take a train it's just a long haul well  i don't know if you could even drive because you're going to be driving in that horrible rain  which is going to slow everybody down yeah there's a lot of dummies out there when it's raining there  might be a there might be a train or something we could get down on um you want to call one of our  trucker friends no they can pull up to your apartment in their big rig and you could jump in  jump in their cab and take a nap those fucking their flea infested bed while they get to north  carolina bed bugs no offense guys no offense fucking crank in the back seat in a little baggy 
[00:25:30]  sounds like a good trip how many how manipulative would it be if i said look guys you should come  see me north carolina it's what greg would have wanted oh yeah the big trip funny the real tragedy  of this is gerald was a big chip fan yeah you know we lost oh was he oh i love chip jesus loved him  god you're down to only two fans call and somebody else god damn it not bob kelly  chip is smarter than bob that's why i've heard about this chip character i've never heard him i 
[00:26:00]  kind of keep him i've heard of him but i never heard him yeah i don't bring him around here much  you know he doesn't feel welcome all right you you mentioned bugs i love rubbing this into the  company i am a company guy in the end i just like to beat you up because i want to make everyone  better around me that's my new take on this whole thing and uh on friday man i tweeted a dumb fucking  picture that hinted at hinted at the fact that uh you know contract negotiations weren't going well 
[00:26:30]  or something else was going on here at siriusxm never mentioned bed bugs whatsoever and man from  the babysitters all the way to the top floor of this building i caught shit i caught a lot of shit  and i kept telling them you're you're insane this bed bug thing is gonna get out i'll make it  perfectly clear no one has seen a bed bug nice whole joint zero uh they did have dogs coming around and  if the dogs sniff guess what you have to take their their word for it and you gotta like pay them 
[00:27:00]  pay the man and make sure uh they they spray the whole damn place but the fact is no one has actually  seen a bed bug so uh i have to get that out there but i i was i was i was dealing with people with  uh less intelligence than myself wow trying to explain to them what are you talking about this  is going to get out there there's so many people that work in this building and their areas were kind  of like uh kind of like uh you know uh they well they had signs on their doors as well i'm trying to 
[00:27:30]  figure out what to say without getting too deep and too in trouble and i'm like if if howard stern  was on friday or if we did a show friday that that would be the first thing we talk about you can't  hide the fact that this might be something that is happening in this building but i got a lot of  shit thrown at me friday i mean a lot i had to talk to scott greenstein on the phone i had messages  uh relate uh relate from uh you know the big guy that we don't mention his name on our show for the  most part he was mad at me uh right down the chain and i'm like this is insane this this info is going 
[00:28:00]  to get out and and it makes for good radio in the end because this is what's happening around us so  with that said of course when howard got back to work on monday the first thing he said was bed bugs  bed bugs does he get the same shit sandwich that i did i of course not of course not i know we're  different people i i get my place i got my place a long time ago but of course he jumped on the radio 
[00:28:30]  and was talking about it he came to work in a hazmat suit which is kind of funny actually and  it is uh really serious yeah that's funny yeah yesterday or the day before and then uh you know  his limo's being taken care of it's a big deal and i told these guys this is a big deal and you know  somebody is going to talk about and actually people did talk about it on friday but i guess they don't  really care about those people that much but it was more that i did something with it and hinted  with that said uh the story's all over the news today and yesterday it's the bed bugs again 
[00:29:00]  the bed bugs cannot get enough of new york city and now they're hanging out with shock jock  howard stern shock jock howard stern's building is the latest inductee to the bed bug club stern  announced on his serious xm radio show that exterminators treated his building over the weekend  and now he says his building is bed bug free he also had to have his limo fumigated after dogs  sniffed the creepy crawlers in his ride oh they oh god yeah i love dogs are a scam man i think it's a 
[00:29:30]  scam i i think there's some up and up uh companies out there using the dogs but if you're if you're a  guy a little down on your luck you know set up ted's bed bug emporium yeah get a dumb ratty dog from the  pound that you know is going to bark a lot and you walk up to these businesses and he'll bark all day and  and you'll make a a pretty livid i think there's some i i really think i do not believe of all the  places they could find bed bugs are finding them at howard's limo unless they find the bugs themselves 
[00:30:00]  i firmly believe that there's something else that smells like them because what what could a bed bug  have that's so different than a fucking uh an ant or uh or even a water bug or any other bug you see in  new york city yeah it bug shit you can i don't care how good a dog is you're gonna tell me they can smell  the difference between ant shit and they don't it's bug shit and with all the people that work  around here i i no one complained about being bit because supposedly you don't get just one or two 
[00:30:30]  your whole body is just covered because if they if they get on you they're just like bite bite bite  bite bite bite they just keep biting so i've seen no evidence here i really think that dog uh i think  the dogs smell other insect shit right and they it just they just bark because they get rewarded when  they bark they probably get a treat when they get when they bark here you go oh good boy what would  you do yeah if you were a bed bug dog right i'd be going here right and fucking get a treat i'm sure  the dog wants to continue working of course he does so it has to bark it's kind of like a radio 
[00:31:00]  consultant a radio consultant he comes flying into your market and then he walks around the whole  place and tells uh tells the radio station all the things they're doing wrong now if the radio  consultant flew into into town walked around the radio station found nothing wrong with the place  yep he's out of a job yep that's why i never listened to those dummies either their motive is  to find something wrong to justify their own existence of course and the same with the bed bug people  do you uh have a tough time talking to people that don't know as much as you  because i would be everybody and it's one of my biggest problems in in life i'll i'll open up a 
[00:31:30]  little bit because when all this was happening on friday i'm like these people just don't know as  much as me and why am i listening to this person and then i try to educate them and it doesn't work  and then of course it all comes out exactly how i said it would  yeah it's bothersome sometimes it's frustrating when you're telling somebody something you know  the results and they're not aware of what the results right so it's satisfying too though i've  been around this atmosphere for a long time and the guy's going you got to call scott i'm like tell 
[00:32:00]  scott no but then i had to call scott and then i had to explain it to him but a lot of people in  between me and scott i'm like you you don't know what you're talking about howard is going to go on  the radio immediately and talk about this sometimes what are you trying to do to me  sometimes it's in the presentation like you because that's probably what you said to them  and they call you go look even though you were right right instead of going yeah look no no i  understand you can misinterpret that but realistically here's what it is right but i know that you're  probably annoyed when they call you and you're like what what no babysitter and that's just you 
[00:32:30]  know it's hard for them to get on on fucking team gregorio you think it's the way i say  yeah because if you tell them like maybe it's just my character on the air maybe behind the scenes  i'm actually uh you know more uh more uh what's the word i'm looking for i don't know because i've  sat in meetings with you i'm pretty direct the same guy yeah all right you should just bring a  fucking a mic with a flag on into the meetings and uh it's it's sometimes in the presentation of 
[00:33:00]  like it's frustrating though i know but they don't it's like you know it's two different worlds  management and on air people i'm like why are you giving me shit when other people tweeted pictures  and actually said bedbugs and and jay thomas actually talked about the bedbugs on friday and  i said to them not only did jay thomas talk about the bedbugs howard when he comes back to work will  be all over this guaranteed i even gave them a guarantee i'm like i guarantee it yeah and with that  radio shock jock howard stern the serious sm radio host new york city offices the latest casualty in 
[00:33:30]  the big apples war with the bedbugs oh no look at that here i look at that's where they are uh the  building was evacuated after it was found infested with the little blood suckers stern saying even  his limo had to be fumigated when bedbugs sniffing dogs found the insects crawling inside after a top  down cleaning the offices have now been given the all clear there you go and then it made florida as well  it's all over the the country a new discovery showing i'm playing all these by the way jimmy 
[00:34:00]  just to rub it in yeah all right i just want to make it perfectly clear for everybody this is uh  directed at a few people they know who they are a new discovery showing no one is immune to the bed  bug infestation howard stern's new york city serious office has been hit by the pests it was fumigated  over the weekend though and now is bug free his limo was also treated after dogs sniffed the bedbugs  out there too the big apple has a plan to fight this spreading infestation with a public awareness  campaign yeah i don't believe i believe the dog barked i do not believe he had bedbugs in that limo 
[00:34:30]  i don't believe it sure any more than i'll bet you if that dog went through every fucking car and  whatever garage it's in sure it's gonna bark every other car probably because again if it's coming from  anybody it's gonna be coming from a fucking a guy who's parking i think ronnie parks his car but a lot  times parking attendants maybe in that atmosphere right but i don't believe in that fucking giant  clean limo that there's bedbugs yeah and i don't want we're in here i did not one bit of bug evidence 
[00:35:00]  other than that fucking faggoty dog who probably just barks i bet his owner just fucking just jerks  his little dog dick after he barks right some kind of a creepy reward that we don't see and the point i  want to make just because you know we we go with the bedbug thing or we uh tweet a picture that's a  little suspicious doesn't mean we're not company guys this is what we do for a living yeah you know  we talk about what's going on around us we beat people up a little bit hopefully we make you laugh  a little bit sometimes we make you think that's our show it's also it doesn't mean i i i'm trying 
[00:35:30]  to beat up the company per se and because when it comes to real shit going on around here we have  real real sit downs and try to work it out beating up the company even once in a while any place you  work is for some reason i don't like it it's like relationships you know your girlfriend your  wife but we talk about that stuff right if i'm having a fight with my chick right i talk about  it right if there's a problem here usually talk about it there's a problem with what it's like  it's just it it's there's hours to fill we have to talk about for us it's like breathing yeah you  know and one more i guess i am completely freaking out today the bedbug epidemic has its first known 
[00:36:00]  celebrity victim howard stern stern revealed that the new york studio where he broadcast his serious xm radio  show had been infested by bed bugs they were in my console on that couch on my in my office and get  this a bed bug detecting dog also discovered that his limo was infested so if they're up here they're  down in the car they're they're in the entire building you better have your apartment expected 
[00:36:30]  martha stewart barbara walters gail king and other big names also broadcast their radio shows from the  serious xm studios in manhattan signs like this were posted around the building please do not  sit here or otherwise occupy this workspace or remove anything from it so far stern is the only  one talking about it publicly by the way what they just read was uh my tweet helps have a photo of it  oops oops but uh oops but like i said once again uh no one ever saw a bed bug in this joint yet not 
[00:37:00]  you wouldn't be able to what scares me no evidence of them what scares me is that shitty apartment i  lived uh lived in before i finally bought a few years back two years two and a half something whatever  it is i didn't know what bed bugs were they had to be in that place if i was infested with mice  cockroaches and those uh what do they call those silverfish yeah they call them silverfish look up 
[00:37:30]  silverfish they're horrible i've had them fucking disturbed in in your new place no no my bug my  apartments have no bed bugs i looked it up in my old apartment when me and florentine lived together i  had uh silverfish are they creepy the rain brings them out and they would come up and i was on the  second floor yeah and i would have like six of them on my wall yeah they were horrid they're one of those  bugs too you you stomp on and and they break apart and their legs will continue moving individually  you know about this right danny yeah my old place had something some of these it wasn't bad but i 
[00:38:00]  would see one i don't even know what they do but they're just so fucking creepy they don't bite do  they i don't think so but they're fast they're dude yeah yeah they really are fast and like i had  them not bad but they were like that you could actually see meat on them like they were they were  meaty and i remember i took giant vag lips i took something i don't even know if it was bug killer but  some something with some kind of spray and i just sprayed it and it blew it blew one of these  things to pieces pretty much right but i saw uh like three or four of the legs just twitching for 
[00:38:30]  what had to be i'm not even exaggerating close to two hours oh sure sure yeah they just keep going  you're absolutely right creepy things i think i i think i i hated them more than the mice when i saw  the mice running around just having a good old time in my old place let's say hi to cassius in  brooklyn cassius hello there boys how you doing what's up brother well i guess i gotta i gotta  take this opportunity opportunity to uh correct jimmy a little bit that uh i actually i i have  i currently have bed bugs um and they have they have a totally distinct smell to them they have this 
[00:39:00]  weird it's a sweet smell when you when you kill them uh with your fingers which is the easiest way to  to get them when you see them it it's this weird triacly sweet smell and so you can see how the  dogs can't be trained to smell them you know as opposed to any other insect uh did you get rid of  them well hey cassius not not yet not yet i mean it's it's it's a it's totally a ridiculous situation 
[00:39:30]  because the exterminators expect you to like throw so much out like i have a bunch you know books and  media like they expect you to be willing to get rid of everything and it's like wow it's absurd  it's totally nuts that that they haven't developed like a simple fogger for for us to just you know  put in the apartment or house and bomb the place and well this is our bird flu this year it's all  brand new for everybody so hey cassius have you seen a bed bug yeah yeah all right so that's what  we're talking about no one here saw any not yeah but you would assume you would have saw you know one 
[00:40:00]  or two uh running around yeah yeah let me tell you something i'm not gonna i don't i'm not gonna  question i don't know whose dog it was maybe it was legit but if i had i'll put it on me if i had a  dog and could train that little faggot to bark whenever i wanted it to and i was in a corporation  that had money you can bet that dog would bark or get the shit kicked out of it because if the dog  barks that means i get paid from a big company it makes sense right all right yeah yeah all right 
[00:40:30]  cassius thank you someone on instant feedback uh thomas h thanks thomas h from georgia look up cave  cricket i know what the cave crickets look like my my poor brother is infested with cave crickets he's  got this weird like old school basement where it has the the the low ceiling so the house is a bit on  the old side and it kind of looks sort of like a like a cave a lot a lot of rock work and stuff  and uh he's infested with these things he has hundreds and hundreds of uh glue traps down in 
[00:41:00]  his basement and every time we go over there for a little family function then they don't go into his  his house thank god he has never seen him in the house but in the basement we uh we just take a look  at all the traps and there's just hundreds and hundreds of them uh on the on the glue they look  terrible because they have the giant back legs they're really prehistoric looking they're prehistoric  looking and i i think they have a shitload of babies because i'm i'm telling you hundreds and  hundreds in the glue traps what do they just can't get rid of them he's got a full-time guy trying to 
[00:41:30]  you know keep the the the the cave crickets at bay how do they get in well i don't it's a it's a real  old like you can't even really call it a basement it's like a cellar really attached to the house you  know what i mean can you block them look at the legs they go way up higher than the body in the back  who wants that jumping around nobody do they jump on him when he's down there or no no you don't  really see him do they bite you see him on the glue traps because i guess i i think i would assume  they come out when you know it's dark or something so you turn the lights on maybe they start scurrying 
[00:42:00]  i don't know i don't know i don't know what they do but i know my brother has it and he's just  fucking hating it yeah he's been fighting this thing since he bought the house cave crickets sounds  like some sort of a racial insult to somebody right i don't know who yeah but it could be  there's you know 20 different ethnicities that could be insulted by cave crickets yeah you could  maybe al-qaeda maybe caves oh okay that's going to easy one so all right uh oh also uh we were filming 
[00:42:30]  a uh a video in between like uh the live breaks yesterday i got everyone involved the uh the stevie video  came out really really well i was not at all happy to be a part of that because i kept thinking  mine's going to be the one that this kid grabs his chest and falls over yeah yeah he's he's very  easy to scare jumpy and we had about 10 i don't know close to 10 guys scare him throughout the whole  day because people like what why didn't he catch on to you guys because that was filmed over a four 
[00:43:00]  hour period yeah we let him uh get back to doing what he was doing for a while and then we would hit  him again and again and again so the video is up on my youtube channel doing really well op radio  it's the latest video up there check it out but uh jimmy's in it bob kelly's in it anthony's in it  danny's in it i'm in it sam's in it erock's in it troy's in it stevie's in it stevie's in it  and by the way he doesn't have down syndrome because people are a little confused yeah he does not they  think he has a little of the down he doesn't no he's he just has uh horrible eyes that would actually 
[00:43:30]  be a step up yeah yeah he's got horrible eyes but trying to walk by and just see his face plastered  against the computer monitor yeah jesus christ dude and then other people saying his acting was bad  there was no acting this is this is what the guy does there's always someone out there that just has  to be a complete twat about everything why should either just go away or just shut your mouth they uh  they can't help it and it was like why can't they help it though they just it's obvious the guy's not 
[00:44:00]  acting they're just asses they are asses and then claim their fans that's that's what's very confusing  but but with david uh remember intern david would have that reaction if you touch him here you go  lift up and it was a completely unconscious reaction he didn't get on purpose god i wish we filmed  that oh we did i have film of that oh did you put it up i don't remember i have a couple of videos  of david i have videos of david drunk at the uh live event we did yeah when he was on stage  oh you remember he was fucking loaded on stage we were all hoping he'd puke but he didn't yeah i think  that was that was the last halloween gig that we did right oh yeah i just stood at the bar with uh 
[00:44:30]  with a good old intern david and just started plowing him with drinks jesus  that was a great event wrecked the entire audience dressed as empty seats  get it yeah i hope for that that was a rough one yes i don't know what happened with that one  we didn't promote it right that was a rough one we didn't promote it enough honestly we didn't  i remember thinking why are we talking about this i don't even think we did have done a live  performance since we should though yeah we'll do another live show yeah it's fun somewhere 
[00:45:00]  fans are somewhere all right why don't we take a break um ants on his way in should be here soon  yes it's uh it's 100 rain here in new york today 100 and it's get look at the that's what it says  on tv 100 rain meaning that it's just going to rain all day long and and the rain is just going  to get harder as the day goes along talking about five or six inches of rain that's a lot of  fucking water man it's awful i'm gonna check trains see if there's anything going down to  yeah where's the gig tonight jimmy it's raleigh north carolina so i gotta see if uh if if because 
[00:45:30]  we leave i'm guessing a train a train is gonna be like seven hours so if we leave by  if we could be on a train you know at a reasonable hour we can make it right go right to the gig right  and then just fly home on sunday seven hour train ride it would suck but i mean i don't i would take  that over you could easily have a fucking five or six hour travel day with an airport can you do an  excella where's the excel end they don't probably go it ends in dc can't you excel it to dc and then  pop on something else i'm pretty sure raleigh's a slow train ride all the way to raleigh yeah i hope so 
[00:46:00]  oh my god i hope you don't have to be on a train for seven hours i almost hope we can because this  way a it's safe for b i know that we will get there right okay but who has ever rushed to raleigh  raleigh's not a bad town i know i've been through there a couple times not a bad town you'll wind up  there in witness protection if you have a fucking you know travel diversion hey uh we have the you  had the bit yeah greg giraldo uh passed jimmy really uh really did did a good job talking about 
[00:46:30]  greg uh to open up the show today make sure you listen to the replay if you want to um you know  check out what jimmy uh is saying about the whole thing but uh we're gonna play some of his bits and  some of the times he was on our show yeah and you uh brought up uh him talking about being on a  plane i just remember hearing this and again knowing the guy for as long as i knew him like  i didn't realize at that point it had gotten that bad right so it was uh he was just an honest funny  comedian about his life and the bad stuff in his life and the divorce he just talked about everything 
[00:47:00]  right that's what made him a great comic he talked about everything he didn't hide any of it  no uh most of you guys don't hide that much so a lot of the guys i respect don't but a lot of  guys do man a lot of guys are i set up knock them down guys and and you know set up punch set up punch  and uh you know you'll never know what's truly going on in their personal life which is okay  like rodney dangerfield was like that you never knew what rodney's life was really like he was just  hey my wife you know after she was daddy talk he was a major pothead yeah major pothead major 
[00:47:30]  fucking pothead he didn't talk about any of that stuff it was all jokes and that was great wouldn't you  love to uh read a book on rodney it's too bad he didn't ever write one he did i have it what he  didn't remember when did he write it a while ago i think it was it was either about him or it was him  yeah i have it it didn't do well i don't remember hearing about it yeah it's out oh you know what  i'm gonna have to check it out on my kindle yeah his friend joe answers was a buddy of mine who i  think i've talked about before joe is a good guy which he was still alive because he'd probably have  great rodney stories right but he's not so he doesn't all right we'll go to uh break with greg giraldo 
[00:48:00]  talking about this plane incident that jimmy brought up a little earlier yeah on the show today  how horrible is it great being wired on a plane oh my god it's a fucking nightmare it's awful right  i was i once flew i was flying to do this fucking college gig once and i'd been up and  and i was totally paranoid like you know the paranoia that kicks in and i thought everybody  around me were agents that were out to get me and i started and this i mean it sounds crazy  to people it's temporary insanity then it passes you know like it's temporary psych you know whatever  you call it psychotic schizophrenia whatever you start hearing people and i thought and this one  guy starts speaking to somebody in like an australian accent like buckets international like

[00:51:30]  seems to have been a um a couple accidents puddles that uh swallow up the little cars  when people when people bash the uh what they call the gas guzzlers the escalades the suvs go  fuck yourself because you could ride right over those cars i'll go right through those puddles  they got to step on the brake and go through them at like two miles an hour  perish the thought some some water gets up into your engine compartment and just stall out get out of 
[00:52:00]  the way ah damn is it raining out i know it is and long island crazy rain really crazy rain i was  checking my pumps i love when you got to check your pumps has your pool overflowed yet no it uh it  gets close though yeah it gets like right up to the top of the skimmer and then i got the uh the  pumps for the basement right and that's imperative because i have like the nicely finished basement has it 
[00:52:30]  ever flooded the basement movie theater once before i had it finished one of the uh i have like these  well windows window wells in the basement yeah one completely filled up with water where it looked  like uh i i lived in an aquarium you could see the water right there and then that glass just  it broke it broke and about 55 gallons of of water of dirty water yeah came pouring into the 
[00:53:00]  basement this was pre-finish happens in new york uh my brownstone i lived in  fucking lost everything in the basement i'm one of those guys the whole wall yeah the whole wall  came down and the whole basement had a foot of dirty sludgy almost sewer-y water and if it's finished  there's no way you got to rip everything out well the finished basement is a nice facade because  the water still wants to go down in there yeah kenny lost a lot of shit in his basement yeah with the 
[00:53:30]  fucking rain once just a pain in the ass though what is this i didn't even know we were getting  remnants of a tropical storm yeah i hear about this shit sort of a like uh like a hurricane that kind  of fell apart type of thing i think yeah yeah didn't go through florida middle of florida now it's  yeah moving up the coast heavy rain here heavy rain today uh this morning and then it clears up for a  little bit and then uh massive uh rain later on and poor i hear poor jimmy's gotta fly well i don't 
[00:54:00]  know are you freaking out you get a train schedule we're looking now no well at least i'm on a prop  that's always good in this way oh no why would i be on a 767 but it's not it's it's the bigger  prop continental has which is the uh they seat like 70 people the embrayer it's bigger than the  embrayer oh embrayers are 51 seaters they're jets and these props are not jets they're props  the bombardieri i don't know if it's a bombardier is it two seats in one or is it two and two oh two 
[00:54:30]  and two two and two all the way back i don't i don't get the two and one it seems like the plane  has to be lopsided yeah doesn't that seem that way i don't get it so we're looking at train schedules  now because here's my thoughts and i'm going to really take my time with this why don't you tell  everyone to go fuck themselves and you just hang out in new york that'd be nice can't do it it's  money man i gotta pay bills it's like you can't it's a mortgage look at you i can't get to the 
[00:55:00]  club last minute and or people have bought tickets what have they done for you well when i get down  there hopefully they're going to realize my travel day and go this kid's balls look heavy let's drain  them onto our kids um i like a guy that'll risk his life just to go and do a comedy show come on if  it's safe they'll fly if it's not they won't that's why i want to be on a train that's what  the big bopper said i really am an asshole right oh god i know bau bau bau bau bau bau bau bau bau  hello baby that's where they thought they had a nice nice day for flying too and i'm thinking poor 
[00:55:30]  gerald too he dies everybody's gonna do all these tributes to him and they're gonna do and then all  of a sudden i have to go and fucking ditch it in a plane crash they're gonna throw oh yeah and him  oh believe me it'll just be awkward and secondary and you guys wouldn't even be known because tony  curtis is dead yeah greg gerald is already off the map tony curtis tony curtis died overnight greg  gerald was getting all this exposure today and all of a sudden it's gone already because tony  curtis i haven't even heard of tony curtis tony curtis you know spotticus he's old only gives a 
[00:56:00]  fuck about tony curtis that's that's a big hollywood royalty but he's old man he was greg was a guy in  his prime i know tony curtis is like all right that's like the way it should be an older guy has a  wonderful career he retires then he fucking goes i thought he was already dead to be honest with you  yeah i know right i really did you thought he was one of those guys yeah i didn't know jamie  lee curtis's father that's right was it expected uh he was 85 oh yeah right maybe that's 85 i think  you start expecting uh the grim reaper anything to come and get you 44 man fucking came out of just 
[00:56:30]  like not came out of nowhere i mean obviously if you're od and you're in the hospital and but when  they said like stable and yeah you're thinking all right that was all those rumors no one knows what  was uh happening nobody knows what was still no one knows what really transpired is there going  to be some kind of investigation i imagine there is whenever there's something like this that happens  i don't know no idea i mean that is a shame i don't know man whatever it is it just sucks i know 
[00:57:00]  i was i was i got so sad looking at that picture of you and him it was so sad because you guys are just  smiling yeah it's a cool being correct i said before we took weird pictures together  and uh you know i have a lot of photos with him from tough crowd over the i mean we photographed  hundreds of times yeah yeah but that was one at the the wedding we just we had a good time at  noam's wedding who's uh you know and he was in good spirits and his chick was with him and me and my  girl we had fun get a new chick and everything right oh yeah yeah was she cool yeah she was really nice  i didn't know her that well but um she was like oh let's take some pictures you know so we took a 
[00:57:30]  bunch and we hung for a little bit and it's always there and tom papa and the whole crew it was good  yeah you lost one of your crew man yeah he was he was one of the tough crowd guys one of the  colin quinchot guys one of the main tough crowd guys well it was patrice colin greg they love more  than any of us greg gerald greg gerald greg colin myself keith patrice and nick dapallo like the  colin was the lead the head of it and of course the five of us were kind of the the show regulars  right just no justice in this world there are fucking ten people off the top of my head i could think of 
[00:58:00]  it oh my god should probably yeah lindsey lohan snooki yakov smirnoff  so parody guys why does yakov just continue because i want to say carrot top there but  in all honesty we're now friends with the guy yeah like we turned the corner with the carrot top he's  a cool guy and yeah he knows what he does isn't he absolutely knows and he and he talks about it so  it's making fucking mega bucks doing it right so the carrot top thing doesn't work anymore in my 
[00:58:30]  in my world so i have to go with yakov yakov smirnoff just so many other people that you know  you're like oh god why yeah yeah i don't know a bright hilarious guy i was really fucking bumming  though yeah me too i i was actually bumming from the day before yesterday because i kind of you kind  of knew where this was heading oh yeah and oh you did i had a feeling yet because i i realized that  initial reports i'd gotten would just not intentionally but unintentionally too optimistic 
[00:59:00]  i left you alone yesterday because i asked you and bob kelly and i could tell by your body language  that you knew something that uh the rest of us did not i went okay leave that alone yeah because  you well you never want to you knew yesterday before i suspected strongly but i i'm one of those guys  man and i don't want the jinx in but i also i i'm i'm i'm a bad friend sometimes like i kind of wish  i had gone to see him but he was in you know only for a couple days and uh what see him in the hospital 
[00:59:30]  it's like out of people going to the hospital a couple people i didn't realize they were i actually  did not know but a couple of my friends went down and i said maybe i'll go when i come back  because i had to leave today was he even awake though no no no that's just that he never gained  consciousness no and i don't remember him like that no i know that's how i am too it's like i don't  want i really because sometimes i get shit for not going to the hospital and stuff like that it's  like you know something i don't want to fucking see people like that and it's also you don't want to  i i cry a lot and shit like that i'm a blubbering idiot and it's like i don't want to burden the  family that's the the worst part i'm the worst i can't handle it and i'm just gonna be sad and 
[01:00:00]  bum his kids out and then you'd be one of those people that just throws themself oh my god throws  himself on the bed or the gravesite or the coffin during the fucking way throw yourself in the hole like  take me instead oh my god a lot of mamas do that yeah if i was dying no if i was dying i would drag  someone else in and go take them i'm selfish what about this cocksucker good you cry a lot but you're  not stupid yeah i remember when manny was dying in the hospital we were all in the hospital and i 
[01:00:30]  just manny and sal yeah do it for manny it's the one who did cafe wa manny was the owner of the  comedy not manny roth manny uh dworman whose son noam's wedding right yeah and manny was he had cancer and  we knew he was gonna die very soon and i couldn't i was really talking and stuff and and just to see  manny so broken because he was he was the funniest motherfucker any of us knew he was brutal but i i  just looked out the window and cry couldn't even look at him and i'm like it's just gonna depress him  to see me look if someone's looking at you and they're bawling it's fucking horrible you're like 
[01:01:00]  it better be because your cock is so big that the person's crying that theirs is so out of jealousy  yeah or if it's a woman going my god you're breaking my spine with that building you call a  cocksucker but i didn't want to a tell was very fine i love to tell and gerald was great i mean  gerald was holding his hand and i i met him once i want to hold his hand and gerald did it and i  couldn't do it i was too weak and i always loved gerald for that he was strong enough to hold manny's  hand i couldn't do it were you guys there when he passed rough no me and colin were in a rack 
[01:01:30]  which was was he was very very bad should have been in an old medieval rack the two of you  all right not that good but sometimes workplace stuff works i know um no we were in uh iraq when  it happened or we call we were in kuwait on our way into iraq and colin got the call in the hotel  in the marion or kuwait and he got a call from booker and he didn't want to hear it from him  so he got on the phone the guy goes call it i was oh no no and i think colin like hung up on him  wow because colin did not want to hear the news of manny from him um but we found out i think colin 
[01:02:00]  told me the next day once we got into iraq that he was dead so we couldn't go to the way i missed  manny's wake and funeral because we were away for a week and by then you're already in in country as  they say right sure i don't uh i'm not a big wake funeral guy no i gotta go i know you gotta go  i know it's true you know nobody enjoys them oddly enough suck it up and you go there are a few  people oh i know believe me i i go to no one's a funeral guy there are a few bob eatman that just 
[01:02:30]  what do you think goes on in those fucking rooms there are a few people that enjoy no going to  those no i think they're twisted but you know no you got you get jokes like a harold and maude  fucking thing i would go on record and say i don't think anyone enjoys it unless it's some one of your  sick fetishes kind of like the drama some people like the drama and the fucking like the emotion  off that shit and feed off it yeah i'm not saying they they enjoy going to a loved one's death uh  celebration but but there is like this it's something different it's drama it gets them out of the 
[01:03:00]  house it's like you're trying to save yourself what do you think happens in there they make balloon  animals and yeah and hand out noise makers get a get a nice band to kind of fucking perform for  everybody well like those old new orleans guys in the front of the room those new orleans ones are  pretty cool there are tragedy junkies who marry themselves to it in a weird way because they  they get all happy when they find out they can go to one of these things it's not a happiness no 
[01:03:30]  no it's not it's not a it's not a it's not even a shitty i hate to feed off the sadness of it they  like off the sadness they like the drama they like the everybody else being together i mean i i don't  know if i've ever seen any of these people but uh i've heard about it i'm definitely not one i don't  like these things i go to them i never look at the um the body in there though no never look i'll always  look away and when i walk up to do my little you know you got to kind of kneel over there and go 
[01:04:00]  say a little prayer and stuff i never look really as i'm walking up i look at my shoes and then i  kneel down and i look at my like my kneecaps sitting on the little kneely thing and then i get up and  turn away i don't want to look the curiosity doesn't get you no i don't want to look at a dead  guy's face somebody i knew that was alive i remember everybody i remember i remember them as being  alive what would you would just what you see is a bad makeup job yeah i i don't need that that's  not how he looked when he was alive i don't look you don't look i look no it's cariby a little 
[01:04:30]  curiosity that's now can't look for a second i mean that sticks in your head i'm not excited about it  but you gotta look it sticks in your head i'll easily look you look you look i do yeah i don't  look do you touch no god the people that they they pat the hands i've touched the hands that are like  they're folded over on the stomach or something and they'll pat the hand and look i went to my  grandma's funeral i must have been like 10 years old or whatever and i saw my grandfather leaning 
[01:05:00]  over the coffin and he took my dead grandma's hand and then kissed her on the cheek and i was  incredibly creeped out by that oh yes i'm like i'm just thinking i'm like oh my god he just kissed a  dead body yeah it's like no no you can't do that no no you gotta touch no no touching i if i don't  know the person i don't touch no touching know the person don't know the person no touching no  touching touch if you if you know the person a little bit i would never touch oh wait just i 
[01:05:30]  can only imagine it it feels like a mannequin i think it would feel like a raw chicken before you  like when you're putting a dry rub on it you know you feel like the depending cold flesh kind  of rolling under your hand depending how old the person is yeah you're about right and i don't want  to see that the the fade i don't want to see the face made up like that with the friggin mouth closed  that's old school too a lot of the a lot of the a lot of the funerals aren't they closed now  close casket because yeah put a nice little picture that's what i've heard i don't know what i like 
[01:06:00]  that i know i'm all for closing that fucking lid and putting a nice picture up yeah people remember  that well you gotta look what gear is this you gotta look they did that so so if the guy started  breathing they they wouldn't bury him alive they kept the fucking lid open as long as possible just  to make sure make sure you don't want the poor bastard clawing away six feet under that'd be  horrible well let's go to bob in uh philly bob what's up bob what's up boys how's it going hello 
[01:06:30]  how are you brother good good hey yeah i want to see did you guys see what that cunt gilbert godfried  said about gerald yesterday what did he his tweet was a little rough i read it too what are you right  but gilbert's that way man come on well i i mean i don't know my you know that was kind of my question  jimmy you know personally what did he write it was a little rough what he wrote uh he wrote if if greg  giraldo gets cremated will it be called the greg giraldo roast that's fine it's almost like a 
[01:07:00]  tribute and and gilbert's own sick way because greg obviously greg is one of the most memorable roast  guys uh out there i mean uh he he was always fantastic at those things gilbert probably worked  with him on every roast they've ever done and uh yeah i kind of see that as yeah i don't see that as  of a i don't either that's gilbert gilbert's a very he's he seemed he he said he's an he's never  been emotionally attached on stage at least after 9 11 he got in trouble because he joked right he 
[01:07:30]  goes i gotta take a flight with a stopover at the empire state building it was a funny joke yeah he's  got that gallows humor and greg would have fucking i i was a harsh comic oh he was i know come on you  think uh gilbert has adult autism or maybe some fucking asperger's yeah because it's no i'm being  serious there's a detachment there with that guy he is and his emotions yeah he's a weirdo but  greg come on greg wouldn't have that that you know greg droll was a roaster if he's cremated with it's 
[01:08:00]  a joke yeah that's the type of comic he is i have no problem with that if he said something nasty  about greg or uh or said something like you know hey greg was overrated or something shitty i would be  fucking um yeah it's horrible in the sense that but it's again it's a comedian joking about a  fucking friend and a comedian yeah yeah this guy said he went to a fun wake what provenance point  i guess hey guys what's up what's up sir what's your name sir that's mike sorry hey mike yeah so um 
[01:08:30]  yeah it's really odd right so one of my uh good friends was uh like an evangelical christian like  one of the board against and uh the first half hour the caskets open and there's people just losing  their their absolute mind she was really really young and uh after that they close the casket and they do  it's known as a coming home or going home sorry ceremony and it becomes like almost like a raging  party just singing and people just talking about it it wasn't like there was a tear shed after they  closed that casket it was it was like it wasn't fun but it was uh it made you feel happy well once 
[01:09:00]  see you see with the uh with the uh the guineas uh i know the the once the uh coffin's in the ground  uh and you go back to someone's house then it's it's over the the sadness is over and the party  starts it's nothing but food and drinking and fucking uh but you know having fun but it's after  the fact but you get the feeling that someone's missing someone's missing yeah it's always strange  you always get that and that's cool because where's grandma oh that's right that's why we're 
[01:09:30]  here she's dead put her in a hole that's right now someone else has to figure out how to make the sauce  grandma grandma are you gonna oh that's right oh that's right that's just weird feeling someone's  who's miss wait can we do a head count something doesn't seem right here used to seeing her sitting  right there every time i came over yeah i also heard a really good tweet yesterday where it was uh  god must be pretty fucking cool because i'd rather hang out with greg gerald and lindsey lohan any day 
[01:10:00]  oh i like the sentiment of that but the god ones yeah just that you know i got it i guess god  needed a roaster yeah that's what god needed a roaster right god needed people in heaven  shit on verbally so he's like i'm gonna get girl grab greg that's not the way it works no  god just lets people do what they want i know and hopefully free will and  sometimes that shit happens bro the martyrs command you i was watching that yesterday oh really i 
[01:10:30]  watched the whole movie i was really really depressed you're depressed and then you throw on the exorcist  oh are you a mad person it was on before i was watching it piecemeal watch it stop for a little  while i'd have put on paul part mall cop that's hysterical yeah sure and then put on something  else it's the comedy of thumb right why couldn't chip have gone wait so why couldn't greg be here and  chip be dead he loved chip did he loved chip yes he did oh great so i mean you were really close to  greg giraldo and you're depressed and then you put the exorcist on but i can't even wrap my 
[01:11:00]  the exorcist is not a comedy so it's like it's to me i know but you don't want to be creeped out more  or wow and deal with anything having to do with the afterlife death this that right steer clear of  the death stuff you want something light yeah something like romantic comedy or over the top like  action so the death is just yeah comic bookie yeah something wow i don't know if i could see the  exorcist in the middle of the day in a good mood 40 mile an hour winds i told you it's crazy out 
[01:11:30]  there like you don't even know you're not flying it's sick i'm telling crazy i don't think you're  flying what are they saying at the airports already is there delays they they were saying that uh expect  delays and cancellations uh and 40 mile an hour sustained gusts 50 to 60 uh it's it's like the truck  when i was driving my truck was like like leaning over uh as i was driving in it just so all flights 
[01:12:00]  will be affected by that not just embrayers oh yeah yeah everything big planes too yeah yeah yeah  it's it's it's not pleasant out it's spencer k my wife recently went to a wake for a friend who  committed suicide by shooting himself in the face yo open casket they wrapped a bag around the back of  his head stop it that uh do i look at that i don't know if i can look at that shot himself in the  face but so why the bag in the back yeah in the back what is that about because that's where it blows 
[01:12:30]  out like marvin you know that shit yeah well the entry look good either yeah you would you would  think unless it was a shotgun blast in his mouth i don't know then it would clear out you know the back  of his head and keep everything nice maybe the front would be okay nice they could slap that mouth shut  just get a little like uh what like some clay yeah yeah they'd use that yeah they rebuild you with  some clay that's what they do oh they put like clay in there and oh this is some morbid 
[01:13:00]  i don't like that shit it really is morbid  dad's wake was more of a celebration i think i think if um the person's older it's easier yeah  and celebrate their life a little a little more absolutely when my grammy when my grammy died like  uh what was that last year or something uh yeah it was like kind of you know expected she was well into  her 90s and it was kind of uh you know slap the lid shut lower the box in go back to the house and uh

[01:19:00]  coming back from break shit just throw the mics on and start talking where's human being where's jim  where's he where's he are you all right yeah just explain the whole fucking thing i wasn't listening  i was going around i was eating why listen as i'm talking into a mic i didn't know we're on the air  if we knew we were on the air i would have focused that was my whole problem that's why i asked i thought  ah fuck i'm coming jimmy's gotta get in in raleigh north carolina we got this tropical storm that's just  coming up the whole fucking coast so he's he's just gonna be flying his shit all day so he's trying to 
[01:19:30]  get on a plane uh from here to north carolina i only landed uh two hours ago myself how bad was  it i was meant to come in at midnight and then because the rain was delayed by five hours and  i've just come in so i haven't slept how was it coming in a little bumpy it was fucked up man  where'd you fly in from l.a from l.a yeah okay yeah it was pretty wet a little wet outside a little  wet outside they can handle the wet it's 40 mile an hour winds that they're talking about crosswinds  and yeah and it gets a little wild although this rain's gonna be pretty damn hard they're talking 
[01:20:00]  five or six inches when it's done when we were coming in though there was a weird thing i don't  know if it's got anything to do with it but the the lights in the cabin flicked on and off right yeah  then the pilot comes on and comes on and goes oh i don't know what happened there oh that's  technology for you right now you don't want to hear that when you're 40 000 there's got to be more  sophisticated technology than the light switch for the cabin yeah in the front there if he's bemused by  that like oh i can't figure out how this thing works yes he was wow that's something you bring 
[01:20:30]  up a good point though because when you're taking a flight and they can't get the fucking tvs working  you're like well what else is not working on this plane right now yeah yeah exactly oh well look at  that there we seem to be having a problem with the uh movie tonight what else is uh what what other  problems we're having i hear jason ellis is coming in i'm quite nervous uh jason ellis is coming in  quite nervous oh you guys went out of last time a little bit right a little bit well yeah i after  he got here i said that i thought he wasn't funny and there he's a bit of a cunt so let's see how 
[01:21:00]  this plays out oh no thanks for setting up the last hour nicely for us no that's good i only found  it 10 minutes ago but i've been asked to go on his radio show in la two times and i've told him i've  told his producer to fuck off so oh this is just one let's try to make friends this ought to be yeah  friendly yeah we'll see how this plays out hey hey the boys are telling me that you don't remember  being here last time um no no i didn't know there was a time in between i remember but that time  with the porn star all right yeah i've seen it back on the internet several times where you were 
[01:21:30]  where you were dancing with uh shawnee joley joley oh it was who was it justin joley justin joley  all right right i have another argument with i was i was on mountains of ecstasy and it was  st patrick's day and i i haven't had a drink by the way for a month wow longest in my whole adult  life are you dying um no because my liver i was getting psoriasis but my liver got enlarged and i  was shitting blood so holy mother fucker yeah i know when to stop i know i know the signs 
[01:22:00]  that's when you stop yeah did you go to the doctor i went that's a fan of the doctor sort of sort of i i  had a munch i went to australia for a month and i did montreal for a month and i did the adenborough  festival for a month and i drank every day from morning till night for three months and it was  to the hands were shaking and stuff like that but the thing is as with that radio show this is what  i was saying to the guys back there as with that radio show i came in on ecstasy the problem is 
[01:22:30]  i perform very well fucked up i always have right on stage and everything that's always been like a  good thing i really needed something damaging in my career where i i was a disgrace and people  weren't booking me anymore and all that wow but that never happened so i just i just kept going  until my body said nah you're fucked yeah so you know well i've seen your um i've seen your your  special and uh you just keep grabbing beers from behind yeah and and those i i didn't doubt for a 
[01:23:00]  second that those were real yeah honest to goodness beers well the the new um special i just did for  britain alcohol cost which is coming out um i'm yeah drunk during the whole thing during the whole  thing so a couple things what what i mean beer didn't do that to your liver uh it was lots of  shots and everything i mean i think beer can do that to your liver i'm not stupid but it would take  i was it wasn't a lot more abuse it was did you drink some hard shit too i know i drank a lot of 
[01:23:30]  jÃ¤germeister as well like as soon as you get as soon as i got too full on beer i went straight to  shots and then wow i black out i'd wake up and start again oh but the thing is i have idiot friends  who were doing the same thing as well so i wasn't alone and it's like you know how people say that  they're drunks when you start drinking by yourself or you start you start getting drinks like on the  sly no i was openly doing it with other people this wasn't a secret you know so i don't know why you  need the alcoholics anonymous i'm the most obvious drunk in the world yeah yeah people kind of know 
[01:24:00]  you drink and yeah that's what you do so i've stopped and it's it's a weird um you know i don't  what do people do you didn't want to stop first of all right no i don't know what do you do what  do you that's the biggest problem people have there's only so many movies yeah once you've seen  them all and you gotta call bob kelly and you gotta get a hobby you gotta like get into fly  fishing i've gotten into cooking see there you go yeah i bought myself a mixer the other day i've got 
[01:24:30]  i've got a garlic press never had one of them in my whole life and you're cooking what are you cooking  like what i've started with see the thing is for guys giving up booze i've gained a lot of weight  because i'm just because i thought oh well all those calories i'm not having through booze but now you  do that stupid thing when you give something up when you're like ah well i shouldn't deny myself  this chunk of cheese covered in chocolate because because i'm not drinking anymore right right yeah 
[01:25:00]  i'm taking care of myself i'm taking care of myself so i can have that put a cigarette out  on the top of it and i'll have it as a dessert what did the uh what did the doctor tell you about  um this uh um shitting blood uh well the thing is i always thought it was hemorrhoids because i've  been shitting blood on and off for since my early 20s but this this time that's as soon as you  shit blood man that you gotta go right to the fucking if it's if it's red it's lower intestine 
[01:25:30]  that's hemorrhoids i've been a hemorrhoid guy did you take a shit before you came in here  because this this might be a weird coincidence but there's this bloody shit in one of the toilets  no way no no i haven't had blood and i was gonna bring it up on the air and then i forgot and then you're  you reminded me because you're talking about this i'm not i don't think they i don't think it's  flush because no one no one flushes anyone else's uh shit so someone should run down there and take  a picture of it's a rusty bloody mess in one of the fucking toilets i'm i'm i was a hemorrhoid guy  for years and then that's when it's bright red was it you danny is that's good hold on good dark 
[01:26:00]  red bad that's internal that's that's doctor for you that's don't talk to talk dark red means  ass cancer bright red hemorrhoids is that what they say yeah because the dark red means it's  been swimming around with shit darker darker it also means you probably had two bottles of wine  within the past day or so and it just makes your um shit all grapey is that what you're telling 
[01:26:30]  yourself that's what i'm telling i've had i've had a good wine shit every so often a red wine  shit where you look and just go oh wow stupid uh i've never drank a glass of one vegetable juice  drinks will do it too yeah yeah you put a little beets in your stupid uh vegetable juice yeah well  beets will do that oh boy will it that's a fucking die so how is it performing without the alcohol  jim well i i had done gigs before without alcohol if i was driving to a gig or something like that  um it's all right you know they've been going fine um it's i'll tell you okay they go well you 
[01:27:00]  never have i i haven't had a blinding gig like i have when i'm really drunk when but i also haven't  had that one where um some woman just says some innocuous heckle and then i've gone on for 10 minutes  about how she's a whore and she'll kill herself like sometimes the most unnecessary retorts to people  who that stuff's great to watch though no it's good to watch but it's not directed that's one of 
[01:27:30]  the things when you wake up in the morning that's the guilt the horrible feeling in the morning when  you wake up and you're like i really just abused a person until they cried and all they did was say  something stupid they just threw some heckle out i think they just got up to go to the toilet and  all of a sudden i was like i hope your kids are dead you know and it was unnecessary you guys are  just very angry oh that's bad well that sucks you didn't want to quit you had to well i got the  liver that's a little enlarged i don't know if i'm going to quit forever you're gonna just wait till 
[01:28:00]  the it rejuvenates itself yeah but also the i i kind of was sick of the depression in the morning  you know that it was it was outweighing the good time i was having yeah like i was feeling sad  out of it i always you get it's always a payoff with anything like coke or anything like that  where you go how much fun do i have in comparison to how much depression am i going to get the  depression start to outweigh well the uh the the more you drink at night it seems the better you 
[01:28:30]  like the better time you're having yeah whether you are or not who the fuck knows but you will feel  shittier in the morning yeah like the hangover thing is is the worst thing there have been like  saturday mornings where i'm just like all right it's all day in bed yeah just gonna waste a day  now because i had to have twice the fun last night well that's the thing about being a stand-up you  could seriously when you're at like say the edema festival you're just working an hour a day you do 
[01:29:00]  just do that okay and then i huddled in bed and i'd be getting out of bed for my gig doing the gig  getting drunk and staying in bed the whole day and i'd be staying in bed for like 17 hours  jesus right just in there and not turning the lights on or the tv or anything just laying there  just laying there looking sleep wake up sleep wake up kind of a thing not even sleeping you're just  thinking in like new stand-up routines and then saying i'm shit and i've never written a good joke  and then hating myself and then having moments then having moments of i think i may be the greatest 
[01:29:30]  comedian that's ever lived oh my god what the fuck like it's a horrible that's exactly what belushi was  going through where they found his fucking blood that's one of the things that really got to i read  the chris farley book that was written by his brother called the chris farley show and there  was things in it when when they were trying to tell stories like it was it was all written by little  interviews like chris rock would say something and david spade would say something right and they  would mention an incident that happened with chris where he got drunk and then cut his hand 
[01:30:00]  punching through and i'm like i've done worse than that that was that was the moment we knew that we  were never going to have him back and i'm going that was that's a tuesday that's a tuesday  yeah so i what does what does gunta think about this whole well no see the thing this is what i was  saying before my mom will listen to this and i will have to go lie and say look as a stage persona and 
[01:30:30]  all that type of bullshit right and for the most part because she's a mom she'll believe that  but that one incident when i came on ecstasy on here right yeah yeah who was the other comedian  that day there was not enough lying in the world yeah uh andrew maxwell yeah i looked him up after  the fact he's fucking huge yeah he's a huge comedian and here he was fucked up with you he was  fucked up yeah he was just done yeah yeah if if you were pawning that off as an act you would have  gotten an academy award like yeah like you should be an actor then because that would would have been 
[01:31:00]  amazing you know where we sit that was awesome radio by the way oh my god yeah and that's that's  the one you don't remember uh being here for i've seen the footage back because i got dumped by my  girlfriend because because of that appearance because i was saying to the porn star go out with  me i don't have a girlfriend i'm single please have sex with me oh like it's it's fairly damaging you  you can explain i think you could have explained that to her i got it back i was doing it for the  radio show no i said i was on drugs and acting like an idiot and then she said what else do you 
[01:31:30]  do when you're on drugs oh wow not that that's all i i reserved cracking on to women when i'm live  on air i'd never do it in a dark room when no one would know you go there you go i'm in trouble again  now you're fine so i can't put this on the internet so so gunta uh checked out the video  yeah very she searches out your audio and video doesn't she um she has one of those little things  every time my name's typed into a google oh oh yeah she gets the google and when you're 350 pounds 
[01:32:00]  that's your hobby sitting playing solitaire and getting google alerts of of your son you know because  it's a thing there's certain things that she really enjoys like a new poster a dvd cover or something  like that that that's like mum porn you know what i mean mum porn yeah it's mum porn i'd reckon she  put one leg up on the table and flick herself off with the other one going look at my boy  but uh but the the jim jeffrey's drunk jim jeffrey's on drugs stuff nah not enough so much 
[01:32:30]  yeah yeah not as happy as you think she might be doing here well a lot of drugs and alcohol yeah  yeah that was uh saint paddy's day i remember you guys came in from the night before steaming the  night never ended for those the thing is we'd been sitting on a roof or something like that it  was all dark and then we went back into the house and i actually thought in my head when i was coming  i remember this much we were staggering down the road and i had some other bloke who he was the guy 
[01:33:00]  supplying all the drugs the rich guy right and then there was andrew sort of just normally when i go  downstairs to the lobby they check my id and then they look at the photo and back like that but i  i walked in with this drug confidence right and just went in i went i'm jim jeffrey's and these are  my associates my associates and they let us all and andrew if you remember was wearing like a green  jacket with like like four leaf clover glasses yeah he had the uh whole thing he was dressing the 
[01:33:30]  part and so we all got in the lift no one stopped us no one even questioned they didn't even have  passes in we go look at you and uh and as soon as the light hit me in that lift i went oh i'm  fucked yeah because i thought before that i was walking around darkness and just with shades on  it as soon as i took my sunglasses off and my eyes started to shut around yeah it's like oh  now it's go time and i'm fucked up  what uh what uh what kind of uh hangover did you have after that day like um it had to have been 
[01:34:00]  yeah we see the drug hangovers that's they're ones that uh that yeah they're they're i i don't mind  the coughing up phlegm and the headache like i always see that as a bit rock and roll i love  i i i love i love that whole waking up your hair's a mess and then you go outside to get a paper and  you're wearing sunglasses everyone else is in suits and you're like vomiting in a gutter 
[01:34:30]  i like the fact that you i feel like keith richards when that happens yeah it's it's the uh it's the  no one will ever love me and i i always think uh anytime i can't say this no i can't i'll get in  trouble nice look at you oh wow look at that that's good of you we gotta get this guy a beer  or something get him a beer gotta loosen up and open up a little bit terrible  eating watermelon and fucking drinking red bull though god bless you i'm not as funny as i used 
[01:35:00]  to be there's people right now is that is that what worries you that did worry me but the shows are  going fine no you're you're fucking funny dude i used to think the same thing though with the  afternoon drive radio as opposed to morning radio i felt like an afternoon drive before the  show started down a few beers you get on the air and you just start rambling on about something  whatever and i was like when we went to mornings i was just thinking oh fuck you know takes beer out  of the mix and uh then you realize it doesn't matter it doesn't matter then either it's either it 
[01:35:30]  doesn't matter or i'm gonna have a beer at six in the morning and that's a problem you must have done  gigs here shows here where you've you've just stayed up the whole night and then stumbled in  um i don't think i'd be happy there's probably a couple but not anymore yeah  there's been a few come on no not where i i've stayed up from a party or something  i don't think so you got to find hard over to find party in your world though 
[01:36:00]  so you have a lot of like people over all the fucking time well yeah there have been times where  um no where people have left and then i've gone to bed and got like two hours sleep maybe at most  and then you get up and you're kind of like well you're still in the moment yeah that's not that's  not exactly sobriety right here and you come in and do the show and then by the end of the show it's  like ah my head's starting to hurt but uh yeah no no that that's just like if you get a fresh buzz 
[01:36:30]  on like it was with afternoon drive where right before you hit the air you're down a couple of  beers sure that was just like all right now now we're ready to do a show you don't take drugs do you  nah never no i'm not a i'm not like a fucking ecstasy or i the only drugs i take are when they're  prescribed and they're like the legal ones this is that's what happened to greg wasn't it that's 
[01:37:00]  the whole thing yeah but like i'm talking about i i got like a vicodin for a tooth uh uh root canal  are you americans in your prescription fucking drugs take some coke and ecstasy always with  oxy cotton no it was vicodin it was vicodin and all this stuff and oh i got some demerol and  some vicodin and some oxy cotton it was cool though this is how people die though this is how  he'd let you die no time yeah when you got a fucking night table full of them and you're  popping them i was taking it for the actual pain in my mouth you hear what he's saying though he's 
[01:37:30]  not you're not gonna die from the coke though no this is why you're gonna die from the prescription  pills because you get your xanax right and you go oh these are normal pills i have  fucking eight of them when you when you got ecstasy you go i don't know what this will do it looks  kind of dirty i'll bite it in half and see how i feel in 20 minutes if i feel all right i'll have the  other half the fucking guy just explained it the doctor gave this to me there's gotta be good i  can i can take a few of these what about coke where's the logic there look like you're only 
[01:38:00]  taking in lines aren't you yeah but you can't really stop once you start you can't shove so  much in your nose to really overdose i'm not you know condoning i i don't take any of that anymore  i haven't taken coke or anything for a long long time so you're so you're out with the drugs too  oh no i'm gonna uh i'm trying to get some mushrooms you can't die for mushrooms i don't think anyone's  ever odita mushroom and the best time you'll ever have in your whole life that was that's the one  thing i couldn't do on stage i went i was doing uh glass of me which is the biggest music festival 
[01:38:30]  in the world in britain who played uh everyone i think i think paul mccartney was the head act  that night but it's a three-day festival comedians in between the acts obviously no no no there's a  comedy tent okay um and in the comedy tent i was i was on and i had but this is when mushrooms  are still legal in the uk sorry excuse me and uh they were legal at one point oh this is the best  thing ever right you can't just casually say that for two years in in like 2006 to 2007 because the 
[01:39:00]  law was because mushrooms grow in britain all over the fields in winter they've got the right climate  the right grass wow they're just everywhere so you can't police something that grows naturally so what  they said was they went uh they went so dried up mushrooms because everyone wanted to have them  in the summer so people used to dry them up and then you'd eat them are illegal right but then the  dutch were just over the thing and this has been the law for years and some dutch guy was like oh do  you know like uh i have a hydroponic set right so they started growing them in shops in london 
[01:39:30]  like you know when you go to the movies and you get pick and mix and you get your different lollies  right you're different sweet wow you didn't get your different that's uh wow you just said  something no that has no american translation wow okay what was it candy pick and mix and you get  your lolly you know what's a lolly lollies are candies yeah all right you know when you get your candy  in the little bag and you got the different choices of all the things okay gotcha yeah take a 
[01:40:00]  little this a little that i call that pick and mix oh okay okay and you get your lolly and you get  your lolly right now you're gonna say so you got yeah they got that so what they did was they used  to have like this wall of mushrooms in the shop where you go where you go like they'd have like  some philosopher stones some mexicans some colombians and all the different types of mushrooms  right and the dutch guy would walk you along and talk you through what each of them would do oh man and  he'd sit there go would you want something that's more in your head or do you want your sort of your 
[01:40:30]  body to be fucked up is this the first time you have done these it's like picking out a  tea yeah and so we'd get these big bags of them and because as you said legal yeah we were doing  them once a week it was the best time the best two years of my life and then the government came  in and fucked it up what did they finally decide completely they just said no you can't sell them  in shops you bloody idiots stop this you fucking morons look what you're doing 
[01:41:00]  yeah how long do you think this is gonna last you can still do it in holland that's the weird thing  when you're in amsterdam and you every time i go to amsterdam take mushrooms right and it's always  like i'm always there with like my canadian mate and we're always like the cliche tourists but it's  that whole thing when you're walking along in holland with like a hooker and you're on mushrooms  and you see like a group of cops and you're like play it cool play it cool and then you go  fuck this i'm allowed to do all these things  i'm not doing anything illegal and you're like and you're just looking at the cop going i'm on 
[01:41:30]  mushrooms she's a hooker  yeah that's amazing that's hilarious what the  fuck do the cops do there i'll tell you what they do they caught me pissing  oh really that's yeah i read an article on that that's how they get you over there because people  like to pee on all the really nice fucking well no because when you're drunk or whatever and you're  stumbling around the street i got caught pissing my friend reg hunter has a uh good joke this is  his joke but reg hunter says uh he goes he got caught pissing in amsterdam and he goes uh the farm 
[01:42:00]  was 150 bucks for 60 dollars you could pay to piss on a hooker which is actually the going right in  some of the dodging dodgy bits yeah that's wonderful made a mistake so so you're gonna do the  shrooms you're not crazy no not often they're hard to get in this country are they are they  shrooms i don't know anymore i haven't tried to get any in many many years that's what we should 
[01:42:30]  do what are you doing sunday not mushrooms with jim jeffries i don't know  like a book mushrooms with jim jeffries that's like the how to knit an american quilt  yeah wouldn't that lead to drinking maybe doing the shrooms i don't think so all right just asking  i'm not an idiot i know that i know that mushrooms aren't liver and paling are they there's gonna be  some doctor that's going they're really bad yeah they're horrible oh we gotta get dr steve on the 
[01:43:00]  line oh you want you got some questions for dr steve today can you die from mushrooms all right we  could ask can you have an overdose and pass out i know you can get into psychosis is the psychosis  good no i know you can like be rocking backwards and forwards in a chair in a mental home but will  you really bad but the same  they reckon pot affects more people than any other drug because all the teenagers who become  schizophrenic or you know smoking a lot of weed yeah what's the hangover after mushrooms um 
[01:43:30]  it's all right you have a nice sleep after those i've never i've never had about all these people who  say they they see like uh like oh my friend turned into a lizard and then we do and that's all i  think that's all bullshit yeah i just see that like if i was in this room the microphone stands would  be a bit wobbly right right you know what i mean they'd be flexing around but they wouldn't turn into a  snake you better hope not i'll freak your ass right out we'll come in here on sunday dr steve hey 
[01:44:00]  boys we got jim jeffries in uh studio he just uh he just told everyone that he had to stop drinking  because of uh well an enlarged liver a little blood in his stool so he decided uh or the doctor decided  for him that he has to uh stop drinking he's not happy about it well i want to i want to for the  depression and the depression part of it he had enough of that uh the the next day but uh now he's 
[01:44:30]  into shrooms and he wants to know if he could die from shrooms taking too many shrooms well of course  too much of anything is uh not good for you but um i'm i believe that mushrooms you know the  psilocybin and the mushrooms is metabolized this is something i'm in my car i just dropped my kids off so  doing a little biochemistry this time of the morning is a little difficult for me but i could look that up 
[01:45:00]  for you are you uh are you at the drive-thru yet for breakfast and an egg mcmuffin yeah no kidding  i'll have a number two i never cook them up or anything either i just eat them raw just you  just you don't put them on cheese no you just fight your way through them grab a handful of them  and just fight you fight your way through it's horrible everybody would always say you know oh  they taste really gross so you know eat it with something put it on a burger or eat it with a 
[01:45:30]  candy bar and it just if you do that you're just making the like a candy bar taste like  shit just eat the fucking mushrooms exactly and if you put it in a frying pan or something  all that oil's got to be mushroom goodness that you're losing like you must be cooking out some  you gotta be cooking outside some of the good stuff that's some visual snake work falling into the  pan yeah yeah that's gotta be so you just eat it raw and you're man up to the fucking situation but  i mean the shrooms will make you die in in some silly ways though like walking off a cliff or killing 
[01:46:00]  yourself or walking into the middle of traffic thinking you can no it's not it's not like uh you  know like cirrhosis of the liver or something like that as long as you stay in your house oh yeah  does the mushrooms affect your liver because he really has to take care of his liver how old are you  jeffries here's the thing there are uh you're presuming that the person who picked these  mushrooms knew what they were doing too and there are some pretty deadly fucking mushrooms out there  oh when i was when i first went to england we used to go to a field and try our luck 
[01:46:30]  oh my god there's pot luck in the field eat them from the fucking field hey you try that one over  there wow i went there in australia my dad picked out some mushrooms from the backyard in australia to cook  up because he thought they were good but he got he got ill just yeah my sister did that  i can turn green and sat in bed rocking mushrooms we just fancied herself and uh a horticulturalist  and went out and harvested a bunch of mushrooms in her yard almost died from it why my dad eats the  snails from the backyard oh my god what do you mean from the backyard from the backyard just like snails 
[01:47:00]  that are going around just snails hanging out in the garden why would he do that because you can  the same as the snails you eat in escargo you fucking just fry them up you got escargo in  your backyard everyone does the snails oh that's weird isn't it a certain kind of snail i don't know  he eats them i don't know he eats them hey dr steve why is it that some mushrooms make a steak taste uh 
[01:47:30]  you know a little better and other mushrooms will make you see god like i don't get that well you know  know mushrooms have a bunch of complex defenses you know and some of them make compounds that  work on our brains and other ones uh don't do that yeah it's just you know the variety of nature i mean  why did some cacti make peyote and other ones just uh you know i like the truffles the truffle ones  yeah hey jim yes right that's i did want to ask you something that's probably more important is uh 
[01:48:00]  what what the uh the blood in your stool was it bright red or was it no it's bright it's bright red  now it's only bright red yeah okay so bright red blood usually means that it's uh that you're bleeding  from the lower intestine it's hemorrhoids right bright red well it can be hemorrhoids did they look up  there they said i had two that that was a while back they put a camera up there and said i had a  couple um but uh they don't seem to hurt anymore you know the hemorrhoids so i just get a bit of 
[01:48:30]  bright red but the thing is they said they can remove them but i thought nah it's just right out i  don't use i don't use uh rectanol or any of the ointments either preparation h just  tough it out man are you sitting on an inner tube right now are you all right are you pushing hard  what are you doing what's causing them but see that's the whole thing i wasn't having hard poos  for about two months because of all the drinking uh and now i'm having hard poos again it's like 
[01:49:00]  fucking an old friend i kept an old friend i kept on uh they used to like whenever they go out the  first signs of aids is uh is uh two weeks of diarrhea or something like that and i'm like i  must have had that for years but like my theory on ages i can't have it because if you fuck enough  women one of them's got to be respectful enough to call you eventually that's wonderful and say well 
[01:49:30]  i just wanted you to know i went to the doctor and well they told me to contact my sexual partners  and well you think that one of them would be nice enough to say that i've given it and you  got to think if one of them's got it i've got to be the first port of call they blame right and  none of them have done that and also a few girls that i've slept with very quickly afterwards have  had kids and you got to think they test pregnant chicks what uh well what logic you have it kind of  makes sense it makes total sense uh dr steve does that make sense absolutely 
[01:50:00]  yeah yes it does it does though steve doesn't it does make a little bit of sense and you doctors  don't want to conform to me keeping it real with the aids front i don't know what that means and  he's got the enlarged liver there dr steve talk to him because he said he's not going to quit  drinking for good i'm giving it six months and i'm going to start drinking like an adult just like  stag do's and oh well very some people with alcohol problems can pull that off but very few we 
[01:50:30]  really recommend if you have a problem with drinking that you just leave it alone you know  i mean what what else you got there steve really he's looking for other choices another option there  doesn't like that it's a few options uh dr steve give him some hope  need a little hope today give him a bottle of your wine that'll get anyone off of drinking  and then clear up the hemorrhage somewhere where you did they do a blood test and said that your  liver was out of whack yeah this is just enlarged it wasn't it wasn't it wasn't in dire straights 
[01:51:00]  bad bad bad but it was starting to get fucking swollen and a bit crap it was a little ragging  around the yeah and they didn't have to do a blood test it was hanging out of my ass at the time  the liver will definitely they just looked at it and just sort of held it a bit and slapped it  what's that uh dr steve what will the liver will definitely regenerate if you stop exposing it to  alcohol but here's the thing once your liver tests start to get out of whack then what you're 
[01:51:30]  looking at is sort of a pre-cirrhosis situation and if you expose it to uh alcohol again it just  is it appears to be quite sensitive to it and it'll just happen again if you just keep doing it  eventually you're going to do some irrevocable damage to your liver you gotta have your liver you  just gotta have it you're gonna have it right i wish jimmy was here he does jimmy does an impression  to dr steve that is so funny and dead on that's hilarious he said it was just that it was just 
[01:52:00]  the start of bad stuff it wasn't you know ah i'm not i wasn't in dire straights like so you got plenty  of liver yeah no i'm not waiting for a donor or nothing like that yeah so you'll go back that's  what i'm saying no hey hey i might never drink again you ever yeah you'll go back it's the it's  the depression thing that i don't want to do i i suffer from horrible depression i can't you know yeah  you take a little pill for that post-drinking depression see it's like they're not using  your rectanol i toughen up because you know those pills don't work on alcohol and i've always been 
[01:52:30]  drinking along with it so i used to take antidepressants but then i got this theory  that that they don't have any depressants in africa and they have less suicide in africa  right and the people in africa have shitty lives have shitty lives so why aren't they depressed  less suicide because i'll tell you why because there's less responsibility i talk about  no i talk about this on stage it's because we were brought up on dreams and we see dreams as  wonderful things that keep us going and all that type of stuff the reason we live for is our dreams 
[01:53:00]  the reason we die is for our dreams because dreams when they don't happen you get depressed and then  you get down it's before before i was a comic i just dreamt of getting up on stage for five minutes  now i've got an hbo special my dream is to become a movie star and if i'm not a movie star i'm going to  kill myself right that's further than i've ever thought i'll go in life and i'm depressed  because i can see first if you live in if you live in africa your life's so  shit one in four of you dying from age you live five miles from clean water 
[01:53:30]  can't even think to move closer to the water that's how shit your life is  but you see what i'm saying it's it's yeah another good point by jeffries you just you just  gotta write a book get some good theories i bet they're depressed though of course they're depressed  they don't have tv or nothing no it sucks yeah the only reason they kill themselves is they can't  find a sharp enough implement there's not one building high enough to jump off it's hard to 
[01:54:00]  throw yourself off a mud hut you just land in more mud can't stab yourself with a stick it's actually a  very the only way they can kill themselves is by fucking each other and even then that's a slow  fucking demise that's funny man uh all right dr steve stay in the line we got uh steve from  connecticut i think yeah i think yeah steve from connecticut you're talking to jim jeffries by the  way jim's in town because he's playing carolines tonight friday and saturday and sunday wow right 
[01:54:30]  on man two one two seven five seven forty one hundred jim jeffries the monday show me and  and mushroom show yeah mushroom show get your tickets now for jim jeffries at carolines you  did real well last time you're there right yeah you know are gonna be hot we almost sold out last  time so yeah yeah get your tickets early uh steve connecticut go ahead jim uh you know what they  also have in africa that they've got a lot more of than here is sunshine if you're living in uh in 
[01:55:00]  england and places where there's very little sunshine that affects your body's ability to  make the necessary chemicals uh to have a balanced mood yeah but in america you've got plenty of  sunshine yeah he lives in l.a now i live in l.a i think there's sunshine there there's some sunshine  over there i don't draw the curtains i live like a vampire my room stinks really yeah it stinks  the other thing i wanted to offer you is if you've been drinking and you know taking a variety 
[01:55:30]  of drugs for a long time the thermostat if you will in your brain that delivers the chemicals  hasn't had a chance to operate without those influences give it six months without anything  your mood may correct itself or at the very least you'll be able to take advantage of some of the  newer antidepressant pills which are really changing people's lives out there huh that's  some very funny stuff thanks for calling yeah listen to this guy just hawking his 
[01:56:00]  fucking wares let me let me go with some truly's gum salesman let me let me uh go with some reality  here when when you think you're going to start drinking again i i think i'll i'll dip my toe back  in the water maybe six to eight months oh steve oh wow dr steve that bothers you yeah well look i'm not  some namby pamby just say no uh guy i but once you've had some you know who's a nandy pamby  anyone who uses the term nandy pamby absolutely if uh if uh if you've had some liver damage already 
[01:56:30]  you're you're prone to get liver damage again and it can you know it can become a serious thing i  would really advise against drinking jim and uh um i like that especially with the the the you know  the giraldo thing man no no i'm is that a wake-up call for you uh comedians jim i i didn't know  greg i i thought he was an amazing comic and and it did yesterday i wish i was i was shocked um  he openly admitted his his party in waves yeah i was many times elsewhere there's plenty of other 
[01:57:00]  comics you know the jim belushi's and the chris farley's and and and uh what's his name uh artie  lang who's had his difficulties and all that and uh yeah no of course and and the the thing is  great comics as well i i always find that the ones with with the habits and the and the the  self-destruction are always seem to be the better comics yeah because we have to fight through um 
[01:57:30]  not lack of ambition but lack of uh getting shit done you know what i mean like you got those like  we're we're not the guys on the computer all day going come and see me at this and i'm a governor's and  i'm doing that you know and then constantly doing little clips on the internet trying to promote  ourselves yeah yeah we're waking up with a if i can hook her with a cigarette put out in her eye  you know what i mean i'm thinking oh and like like and then you got to work through that on stage  every every couple of days i get a phone call from my manager i'm not sure if it's good or bad news 
[01:58:00]  i'm just like did they like they did like me of course they did i had a good weekend  one who had a substance abuse problem and then kick it though get to live to enjoy their career  like jim norton ron bennington and people like that you know so there are good examples  no i i do i do that i would like to to do that i really want to get into movies and i don't think  there's a possibility of me doing it if i if i don't do anything so i'm off the booze well brian 
[01:58:30]  and virginia has something something really good for you jim jeffries you guys are very i like how  unencouraging a picture elder has just died of substance abuse and you're there going ah you  can't do it now with the holidays coming up no way you're not you're not lasting six to eight months  brian go ahead virginia morning guys hey hey you just need to man up and just get on the transplant  list and keep drinking why don't you get on the transplant get on it now that's not a bad idea  that would be a good thing to get on the list now i gotta get my green card first 
[01:59:00]  i don't think they let those immigrants straight on the list we have i'm not allowed to get  unemployment benefits how often do you think they're going to give me a liver it's going to be a while  we have dr steve on the phone dr steve yes uh uh yeah um i i got some uh advice for jim jeffries  with the sea bridge uh he's got it's a the level is very visceral and uh if you've got the sea bridge 
[01:59:30]  then the liver you know the membrane of the liver uh you don't want to drink the secret  yeah there you go thank you dr steve then you gotta do the founder yeah yeah he's he's no jim  norton and you gotta speed up your words all of a sudden then slow him down again god damn that will  make me laugh every time jimmy would do that well start talking like he's dead now  the right thing you just say well every time well he's taking a major he's taking a major  chance just to get on the stage in north carolina did you see the map it is a green 
[02:00:00]  fucking blob that stretches from new york all the way through north carolina dude i'm not even i  was looking at the new york map and that's one thing the raleigh map is worse yeah like that  shit is spinning we're down there so what is it like a small hurricane yeah it's like a hurricane  that kind of busted apart it's a storm kind of shit not a katrina no but it's windy and and he's  taking a prop plane so he's freaking out well not anymore he switched flights that's why did he get 
[02:00:30]  a jet that's why he fleed fleed the building i'd love i would love to die in a plane really  would that be good why would you love that's the way that's rock and roll that's the way you become  iconic that is true that's the way to do it man because especially where my career is right now  because if i die in a plane now people will always be talking about what i could have been  oh yeah you i want to do it before i've outlived because i'll never reach my potential i've got heaps  of potential i'll never reach it right but people will always talk about i could have been something 
[02:01:00]  they'll listen to all your older stuff and just be like listen to the genius that this guy was  he was just getting started yeah this is this is the thing was i always think that when i get on  planes i go this would be a good one to die on right and then i when i'm because i'm depressed i'm  hung over from the day before thinking yeah plane death right i get on a plane once and i i never  met him before i've never gigged with him since before and i sit next to bob saget yeah yeah and i was  like fuck man now they're only going to talk about this cunt they'll just talk about they'll never talk 
[02:01:30]  about me no no i'm on the big bopper that flight yeah you are the big bopper that flight so he was  the fucking buddy holly uh yeah i was on a flight with him once too and thought the same thing like  i got a fucking bob saget just fucking up everybody's chances plane better not going out famous yeah  hey guys we got dr steve on the line dr steve in britain maybe two breakfast burritos and uh large  coffee uh i'm sorry uh the other thing about the liver is the epidural sac that you want to take 
[02:02:00]  care of and uh you know it's maybe a cup of wine once in a while you really need to watch the  seepage  i love how he's picking up on the fact that you eat like  shit doc fucking i'm calling him about advice on how to keep my heart healthy and he's ordering  what were you ordering i was trying to tell these guys the other day a number three or something  now is a number two from chick-fil-a and what do you get with the number two i don't know some 
[02:02:30]  fucking cheese and i was in taco bell the other day and the milk i ordered everything i wanted and  the little girl's like that'll be two dollars eighty i know isn't that amazing was not i would rather it  be five dollars i don't want to know that they've put in because that means they've got to put in one  dollars worth of ingredients into that meal yeah that means that's really shitty stuff  i would rather be triple the price and be slightly better grade 
[02:03:00]  i don't want the bargain it's one of the rudest drunken things i've ever said to a young comic  like this right i was like i finished i finished the gig and then afterwards i wanted to go to get  something to eat and there was like a buffet over there and i fucking hate buffet meals because i'm  a pig and if i see something like that i'll go oh shrimp and chocolate cake and i'll put everything  on the same plate you know it never looks right i i like a meal that's presented to me that looks 
[02:03:30]  nice like it's supposed to all go together yeah it's supposed to all go together like me potatoes  maybe a little vegetable yeah not chocolate cake and shrimp cocktails and i went yeah i went uh  i went let's go to this other restaurant next door and he goes nah this one's all you can eat  and i said when you're a headliner mate everywhere's all you can eat  that's going to be one of the cuntiest things you can say to a young comic pretty  cunty that's hilarious hey uh we got chris of california chris hanging with jim jeffries 
[02:04:00]  today hey jim this is chris  good day uh i'm 48 days sober now and i never fucking thought i'd ever be like this but i just  give you something to think about have you ever woke up and actually felt good the next day besides  being high um yeah i've had a few days um lately where i've i have woken up because i've been drinking  where i've felt pretty good but also sometimes i have sex with good-looking women and they're good  mornings as well yeah yeah you ever woken up next to a good-looking woman oh yeah yeah my wife but 
[02:04:30]  that's a big for the yeah yeah yeah good answer yeah that must be an exciting wake up she's here  again good answer my wife she ain't here no more that's what i'm fucking getting oh okay there you go  that is a great way to get uh rid of a hangover too if you wake up married morning yeah right you  get more pain in the marriage than the hangover is uh the uh the sex in the morning uh when you have 
[02:05:00]  a hangover it dr steve are you still there i am so horny why does that why does that feel so good  very very that's the best sex you can have very horny hungover and it really does take away the  hangover fuck i don't think i've ever talked about this before the wank i have in in in the morning  when i'm hungover i'm never that's the only thing that's still living inside me is horny that's the  that's the only thing that's still like like got a little ember yeah it's keeping me going spark a 
[02:05:30]  little spark and i find it hard to come in the morning when i'm hungover as well like i do that  wank that sort of looks like you know like your sheets are like there's your body laid out like  the like what's that that cloth that had jesus on it the shroud like where you have that it's all  the fucking dump sweats i want to hear though from uh dr steve uh dr steve what is the science behind  the fact that uh that the sex does kind of take away the the hangover it certainly does that when 
[02:06:00]  you have uh an orgasm there are two chemicals or two classes of chemical two one class of chemicals  and another chemical that are released and the the most important one is the stuff called oxytocin  okay three so um you you've got uh this chemical called oxytocin which is a uh a chemical that's  released when women breastfeed and also it stimulates um uh uterine contractions in childbirth 
[02:06:30]  and it causes a feeling of trust and overall well-being and bonding and uh and so that's one  of the chemicals the other one is endorphins which are basically uh uh uh opioids or uh narcotic-like  agents that are released by the central nervous system and uh and simulate the pain and pleasure  centers of the brain and uh just make you feel better so there's absolutely uh validity behind  that now sometimes fuck isn't there a way if we have these abilities and these chemicals in our body 
[02:07:00]  how come you got to do these certain fucking puzzle things like to have sex or or uh have like um  need an adrenaline burst some kind of fright uh or something to release these chemicals why can't you  just release the fucking things wouldn't that be great it's like i need some endorphins i think you  just can release it let's feel better have you ever had a wank while you're driving we talk about  that too yeah um you never know i'm not yes i'm not of course yeah i've had it yeah of course keep me 
[02:07:30]  awake especially if you've got a really long boring drive it's funny because sometimes some  i has never done it i have i have a wanking but i have a wanking bed to make myself go to sleep i have a  wank while driving to keep me up yes and all right yeah well right and i can't do it without  porn anymore so i used to keep a porn mag in the glove box holy dangerous put it under the seat next  to you you're worse i was driving i was driving you just gotta have a good fucking visual fucking 
[02:08:00]  memory i always knock one out on long flights as well to break the trip up how do you do that  under the blanket no no i take no i go to the toilet i take my phone i got a few pictures on my phone  yeah i can't do it just just straight without any what if it's a red eye you can do it right in  your seat while everyone else is sleeping right in your seat that was a bit you can uh right in  your seat i don't know the blue blanket no because i don't know if that isn't a thrill for me that i 
[02:08:30]  could get caught i've never been that guy everyone's sleeping you just want to get one out but sometimes  i do just leave it everywhere in the little toilet just so the next person no i don't do that  hey while we're at it because you brought it up uh because uh people getting sick of me bringing  this up but do you shit outside have you shit outside you've done the fucking uh jerk on the road  no i i don't i don't shit outside no i think i'm a creep no i never shit outside i don't i don't like 
[02:09:00]  when women piss either i if i see a woman piss then i'm off of for life really there's something  so unladylike about a woman's piss like a man's piss is what a woman should have that gentle thin  pointed stream oh they got like we have we have the effeminate piss yeah yeah they got that they have  just that and it's like whenever like a woman goes in the toilet and she's always like about  whinging about some man like pissing on the seat it's just like oh he left some urine on this 
[02:09:30]  there's some urine on the floor you tried doing standing love with the fucking stream you got  going let's see the fucking the bathroom looks like a a yellow jackson pollock painting there is  something odd about watching a a chick like in the woods or next to a dumpster in a parking lot and  she's got to pull she her panties are and and skirt or something around her ankles and she's got to  pull them away really far forward or else they're just gonna get soaked it's it's it's like a horse 
[02:10:00]  doing it's horrible it's it's a horrible a horrible thing when women do it it's a little rough to look  at there you go rough oh fucking danny's the king he picked up a bunch of fucking by the way oh yeah  good on you by the way they say the meat in some of these fast food joints i don't want to mention  one in particular is like cow tongue and all that that's why it's so fucking cheap oh yeah well it's  they're grinding down they're grinding down the yeah but i eat fucking haggis man the leftovers  there's this processed stuff called pink slime that they add to the beef and some of these 
[02:10:30]  what the fuck is that oh so much pink slime sweet sweet pink slime  all right how come all the girls pissing in these pictures are hot as  fuck you want to see a fat pig doing that no but i mean you would think there'd be a fat pig  chick taking a piss i'm not even talking about the points i went shag the bird who was like a proper

[02:17:00]  you two there's only one incident it'll be fine he's probably this thing right now i'm a big fan of  him and all of his skateboarding adventures i was watching a show called uh i survived and uh  there was this australian woman and there was this apparently just a huge fire that was sweeping  over their entire little village or whatever the fuck it was and she was trying to get away and her  describing it made me fucking i wanted to throw something through my tv we couldn't go any further  the flames were just getting so high and it was like so the fire was uh getting very hot and we got in 
[02:17:30]  not car no you're going up at the end i don't do that anymore it was all up at the end everything  up at the end and i was like stop doing that we gotta find this clip now as we drove away i was  thinking to myself yeah i'm thinking fire's not good i couldn't find me for that and i got me  daughter we went in the car trying to go to the park oh yeah stop doing that sometimes i'm at the 
[02:18:00]  airport and i see like a group of australians i'm like shut the fuck up shut the fuck up you're  embarrassing me and they're going we're going to disney you ever been to disney and i'm like i  fucking live here you fucking cunts fuck off i'm horrible i i i'm i'm applying for green car man i'm  gonna become american i'm gonna do the full thing that's it then i'll be like you guys i'm gonna drive a  big fucking truck yeah big suv i'm just gonna just fucking kill the world and the environment 
[02:18:30]  that's our job be american that's our america's job is to fuck this place up yeah just fuck the  world up it's the next generation's problem i was talking about that somebody i was like you know  something hey everybody says oh we gotta save you know save the world and make the world good for  our children this that fuck that everybody every other generation's been in charge of having to fix the  last generation yeah yeah shit everywhere do you know there used to be fucking smokestacks just  billowing coal yeah i hate how they blame our generation yeah yeah they're always like it's 
[02:19:00]  like we did we invent cfc's no did we invent the fucking motorcars we were the people and it's also  like our parents my dad was always like why haven't you bought yourself a house yet i go because i'm not  a citizen i'm a self-employed guy and even though i make good money and all that it's very hard for me to  to get a loan because i'm watching this documentary america the history of us i watched it all in a  day i went from the fucking mayflower right through to the invention of the mac computer and then i had  to go to my gig so i still don't know what happened on 9 11 but but i got up to there and they had this 
[02:19:30]  thing where they go and the average house in america by by today's money the average house in america was  30 000 by today's money right so that meant cunts like our parents were like i could buy a house in  cash right now easy so now the average price is 10 times that amount yeah it's obviously harder for us  because the world's more populated and therefore it's you know so the next generation is even more 
[02:20:00]  fucked and we're not even going to have a pension because there's not going to be the workforce to  take care of us yeah because this whole idea of the population getting too big it's got nothing to  do with people say i have the one child policy like china that doesn't work you've got to kill  old people because if you've only got one child each time there's not enough people paying taxes  therefore we can't take care of the old people therefore we're fucked it's a pyramid scheme that's  gonna like the bottom is gonna fall out when you get to 65 we've got to put you on a raft and just  wave at you and just just float away just go fuck off the old cunt i'm taking your house 
[02:20:30]  and we keep doing that in circulation the world's fine they've come up with so many new drugs and  new ways to just keep every time i hear of a new vaccine i swear like just bring back polio  sweep across the world whatever happened to scarlet fever  some of the shit's coming back yeah i want to i want to see a cunt in an iron lung i haven't seen  someone in an iron lung for years bring it back bring it back then with the stupid mirror that 
[02:21:00]  they used to have to look at people through see my that bus driver fucking are the kids  fucking up mirror what did the iron lung do i don't even know what the disease was was it just a bit of  asthma it was it was no it was like a like a polio thing and your diaphragm wouldn't work  he's laughing at the pictures your diaphragm wouldn't work to uh to expand and contract uh 
[02:21:30]  your your lungs and you couldn't breathe so that would do it uh mechanically it looks like a hell of  an invention it really like whoever came up with that and and you know they it was some guy working  at like an oil tanker factory that's just like i'm just i just used some parts that were laying around  see that to me looks like something in the future not something that was way in the past looks like  something that that's way in the future forward to see it's like movies movies have never really  encapsulated what they feel like back to the future 2 with the hoverboards and all that uh-huh 
[02:22:00]  it's only five years away i know yeah they're not never gonna work out never gonna work out  but the iron lung all right well that one bring bring the iron lung all right we'll continue with  this after the break jim jeffries has a lot of fine thoughts jason ells uh joins us in just a bit and  uh travis you got some great draw they're going into break no you don't all right i got some  hell knows oh well fuck you travis i was gonna play something else but i could play uh hey hey you 
[02:22:30]  got some yeah might as well i'll go shitting your hat a little more uh draw though for everybody  there's always something new to worry about every day there's a new one bird flu the monkey pox the  mad cow the turtle cooties stay out don't go outside there's no ozone layer if you go outside you'll be  fried to a crisp don't go inside there's mold you can't stay inside either watch out for ticks  there's ticks on the deer the lyme disease it'll fucking kill you and get away from just you know 
[02:23:00]  what it's literally to worry like you just gotta wrap yourself in cellophane and bury yourself in a  hole in the yard and it's hope for the best mad cow bird flu the bird flu the monkey pox a while  back there was an outbreak of the monkey pox in the midwest monkey pox when i heard you can get a  disease oh by the way there was an outbreak of the monkey pox it was people were playing  with their prairie dogs and getting the monkey pox when i first heard you can get a disease  from playing with your prairie dog i thought well that's a weird euphemism you know i thought uh 
[02:23:30]  i thought playing with my prairie dog was the best way to avoid diseases but  people in the midwest were getting the monkey pox from playing with their prairie dogs and by the way  the center for disease control swooped in and stopped the whole thing within within no time they  figured the whole thing out they're like well this this prairie dog had shared a cage with an  african rat from namibia and you can see from the bill of lading that it came from a part of namibia  where the monkey pox is rampant so they came in they they quarantined everybody that ever came into  contact with these things within like two or three weeks they stopped what could have been a serious 
[02:24:00]  epidemic well where's osama bin laden  where the hell is he we we can't find him we can't find him but we can find a gopher with the sniffles and a  terrarium in madison wisconsin do you even uh do you even remember bin laden wasn't he important  where are we supposed to be looking for osama bin laden he's public enemy number one we got to get  bin laden and then the new season american idol comes on we're like oh fuck it i don't even want  to think about it we're supposed to democratize the entire middle east rebuild whole countries 
[02:24:30]  from scratch we can't find one dude we can't find one eight foot tall terrorist with kidney failure  he's tethered to a goddamn dialysis machine for christ's sake he somehow drags that around from  recording session to recording session that's got to leave some sort of trail in the sand wouldn't  you think that we could i mean it's not like he's keeping a low profile he's got a dude every time  you think he's gone forever he cranks out another shitty recording he's like madonna for christ's sake  the fucker doesn't seem to want to go away  mad cow the monkey box the the bird flu the bird flu even that story watch out for the bird flu 
[02:25:00]  it's coming it's going to kill a hundred trillion people it's going to kill everyone it's it's going  to be a huge worldwide epidemic it's a pandemic that's like epidemic but worse there's a p at the  front it's it's a pandemic it's going to kill everyone even the pandas even adorable little pandas  are going to get it everyone's going to die from this pandemic of bird flu everyone will be dead 
[02:25:30]  back to gym with sports they're in  these giant stories and then it just goes away  the bird flu spread to romania now it's in romania but uh it hasn't affected any romanian  people because apparently the virus can't penetrate shitty cologne and polyester sweatsuits  but it could mutate that's the fear the bird flu you know how they know these viruses spread they  find dead birds somewhere they found a dead bird in romania they figure out the viruses there who's  finding these dead birds all over the world when i was a kid we used to find dead birds all the time 
[02:26:00]  we didn't take them in for autopsies we we picked them up and we threw them at the gay kid that that's  what we did that's what we did as kids kids are cruel we didn't even know what gay was yet we just  knew he ran like a girl when you threw dead shit at him so he did it over and over again  you know we tortured these little for choosing a decadent lifestyle  that's what people think these guys are choosing you think this six-year-old kid was choosing to  run like a girl he was choosing to have birds smooshed in his face because he knew that one day he'd 
[02:26:30]  get to wear assless chaps on a paper mache penis float on the game i mean you know pretty much  you're listening to obi and anthony virus serious serious xl  i ain't seen my baby since the night before last gotta get a drink man i'm gonna get gas  oh good one  this is for you jim 
[02:27:00]  we're hanging with jim jeffries today opi and anthony we got jason ellis he's gonna be in studio in  just a minute or two here uh and uh i don't know jason ellis and jim jeffries went at it  on the phone or something right oh i first time you're gonna meet him live yeah i'm not i'm not 
[02:27:30]  you're both from the same place originally right i probably yes so yeah i'm sure i think in the end  you guys will be just fine because he's he's a funny guy i'm an excellent skateboarder not  many people know that about me i didn't know that yeah i i didn't know it either but i i just  i just think i could do it yeah i don't come off as the tide yeah yeah if i said i was good at  any sport would you go really that seems about yeah no i let me think of what sport maybe like 
[02:28:00]  bowling yeah i look like a guy you look like a bowler yeah you know you get a bowling no i'm  terrible at it yeah yeah yeah you think because of the shaky hands you think a big heavy ball that  would be a go-to sport for me yeah yeah all you gotta do is heave it down the fucking lane drink some  beer yeah hang out ten pin bowling is that we is the weird thing that i think that's the only  sport in the world that every single country has gone nah we like that every other sport is like 
[02:28:30]  every other country has its own little separate things but everyone universally has gone and we  all like it the same amount everyone's like yeah we like ten pin bowling a bit like candlestick  baller yeah yeah it's not like uh you know right it doesn't run away with a country where it's like  oh wow that's the that's the national sport of this country or whatever but everybody everyone likes  going it's so fun so we should have the world cup in in bowling fuck that soccer the whole world could 
[02:29:00]  get involved with a bowling tournament i took my nephew and my niece bowling the other day and kids now are  shit at it because you know because the bumper bowling for ball putting the bumper bowling when i was a  kid you just got guttable after guttable and you're fucking manned up about the whole thing you had to  figure out how to not fucking get it in the gutter and you went back with a score of 27 yeah and you  were like all right that was better than last week was 18 i'm getting better i'm getting better then  you'd fluke one thing so my nephew now has reached 11 and he and my niece is nine and so i said when i was 
[02:29:30]  out in australia i said okay she can still have the gutters but you're too fucking old you can't have  him and then he realized he he used to get these top scores and then he figured out he was shit at  it right yeah and so he starts crying because his sister's beating him in a game i go you're 11  you stop fucking crying so that was his outing with his uncle just learning that he's shit at sport  and being told to man up they used to drag those literal bumpers they had like the big fucking the 
[02:30:00]  big shoes things the tubes that they put in the gutter and now it's just these electronic fucking  that come up so things come up and yeah sometimes they come up for you know you could program it  in so it comes up for little jimmy or something you should only be allowed to have the bumpers if  you're under five or you're down syndrome or in a wheelchair maybe a quad if you're a quad  if you're a quad with a ramp and a pointing hat like to push the ball off the ramp i'm not into 
[02:30:30]  that fucking little uh wheelchair person little aiming device and they put the bowling ball on  top of it and roll it down you're not into that you know it's not bowling yeah but like let me use  that fucking thing i'll be able to put it in one spot know exactly where it is for a strike every  fucking time but you're not you're not a retard some people some people okay like i i think yeah i think  down syndrome people because they got the superhuman strength see i used to no they do they're superhuman 
[02:31:00]  see this is the whole thing about down syndrome people right everyone thinks they have a bad life  but in my experience with working with disabled people down syndrome people happiest people on earth  yeah yeah yeah but always hugging and happy amazing sexual energy to them as well but it's because the  the guys have big cocks and they're really strong and quintessentially that's all you want in life  to be strong and have a big cock that would make you happy yeah so that's why they're happy yeah i got a big 
[02:31:30]  cock and i can lift heavy things  i hope you why have you gone quiet are you i know someone uh you're not going to tell me that your  brother's down syndrome or something like that so sam was giving me something i had to check out for  a second is impeccable impeccable your logic is impeccable this this logic has to be in a book  it's fantastic it's very good well they're measured arguments well why don't we why don't we move on  because jason ellis is uh hanging outside the studio yes sam has uh got a little update because 
[02:32:00]  there's problems outside the studio already yeah uh during the break i was in the producer studio  discussing show strategies with troy and travis oh wow sure you were um at which point liam our talent  booker who is with our guest who you would think would be treated respectfully before he came on the  show let me know that blind intern stevie it's somehow of uh down syndrome yes people are  confused they're they're seeing the latest video he does not have down syndrome no i thought he might 
[02:32:30]  have when you think he might have a little bit this is the whole thing he's got the look he's got  the physique but he doesn't have the charm or happiness probably the big cock of the super and  you nailed what he looks like by the way jim jeffries he looks like the little boy out of the far  side calendar so what is stevie doing well i left him in the office and he for some reason on his  own accord for once i didn't even instigate this on his own accord he waddled up the hallway  and started fighting with jason ellis about what like what's his beef bring him in he fought with 
[02:33:00]  him yesterday he's making fun of his accent he called him a princess yeah why didn't he make fun of  my accent why he said after you left the room you said you were a self-hating australian earlier after you  left the room stevie goes now that's a good australian oh now you're mad at him too get  him in here yeah you want to bring jason in too you want to talk to stevie first bring in the far  side bring in stevie for a sec he has the worst eyes without not being blind yeah yeah this is it 
[02:33:30]  so okay stevie what what's going on with you uh i don't know what's going on with you guys oh stop it  you know what you just did then was when my parents go where have you been all night  i don't know you're in trouble what's your problem with uh jason ellis jason ellis and australians  why don't you like the guy outside okay here's what happened the guy outside he's the train killer  yes i was i was introduced to him yesterday and i was trying to have a casual conversation with him 
[02:34:00]  because i don't really know the guy at all so i figured mistake number one by the way you're a  fucking intern you're not supposed to be having casual conversations with the guys introduced me  sam kind of forced my hand a little bit he's like here why don't you you know me all right  just blame sam by the way passing the buck good strategy this is the same thing that happened with  the morning mashup for some reason he's the one intern when i introduce him to people that might help  him somehow like other interns would be like oh cool you introduced me yeah he's saying yes sam forced  me to meet this guy you never know if he's looking for like a half a retard or something you're 
[02:34:30]  perfect for the job look at look at your fucking oh look at your larry sanders lips  doesn't he have larry sanders lips you do have larry sanders lips i can't help how and ricky  likes body he looks like bobby too from yeah bobby from fucking um king of the hell you got a little  bobby now hey there bobby yeah bobby bobby yeah so what's wrong with jason ellis well so i started 
[02:35:00]  having a conversation with i'm not blaming sam at all by the way i mean i'm just saying i had a  conversation with this guy right and somehow it ended up him hating me and we ended up having this  back and forth where this must have been like when you met your dad oh don't bring up his dad  he he scares very easily and we finally learned why because he got beat up a lot as a kid 
[02:35:30]  by his own father you're like you're like when you get a rescue pet and you can't pat it  yeah yeah okay who hasn't been smacked by their father man up i'm not i'm not i tell you what my  mother this is how sadistic this bitch was yeah she used to make me think when i did something wrong  that i'd gotten away with it right and then would be punching you at three in the morning would wake  you up to hits five or six hours later she'd put she'd put an ass kicking in her diary 
[02:36:00]  so yeah you didn't have it so bad come on shambling shit is annoying no i don't want sympathy for it i  just you know now you you what you fucking completely brushed over the whole thing so we were talking and  then he hates me what happened during the conversation something you had to have done something that pissed  him off and if he comes in here and tells us did yeah we know about that one we were talking i  noticed he had an australian accent i asked him you know you're all from australia and you know  he's like has this attitude towards me i don't even well then stevie started making boomerang 
[02:36:30]  jokes oh okay see now why did you leave that shit out why did you do that what a hack  hey go ahead tell me that tell me the boomerang tell me the boomerang joke i don't even remember  it was like oh he's gonna throw a boomerang at me or something i was like oh that's a good one  no it was a joke what what you should have done is he should have said a boomerang joke then you  should have said good comeback because it's a boomerang see that's a professional now you see a  professional as opposed to you and you do have gary shandling's lips now that i'm seeing the

[02:55:30]  to sam that ellis is a douchebag what not not not a half hour ago a mere minute or two ago what  happened why what is it true sam yeah he was like kind of shaking his head going like this and  i said good job and then he whispered jason ellis is a douchebag why the fuck would you say that what  did i have to do with that what is your problem yeah i was telling you he's put the coke he put the  can next to your dick i was probably more a douchebag in that situation and jason ellis isn't responsible 
[02:56:00]  for your inch and a half long fucking cuny dick he is blind so when jeffries was talking he might have  thought it was uh jason ellis we do have a similar physique do you know who's looking at your dick  so hard you know i haven't looked at your dick right yeah i know i know i tell you i am always  surprised about the guests who are on this show who haven't had sex who have gnarly look dog bitten  up cocks like bobo's cocks horrific oh that thing has been through the fucking mill i'll tell you you

[02:58:00]  gene that could lead to us why are they in the ass why did they grow in your ass i was doing things  with my what do you really put stuff in there jason's done some crazy shit in his day i had  suction from a black tranny back in the day i used to have suction from a black train no i've never  in your face i've never slept with a transvestite no i know what i didn't sleep with her  i had suction i wasn't making out with that i was fucking 17 i cried afterwards

[02:59:30]  friends were there like hey ellis and i'm like yeah you know ellis hell you know i mean he's  fucking the bitches in amsterdam and then i went drank some beers and then cried and then i went back  to i lived in canada i went back to canada and told my girlfriend that i cheated on her with a hooker  that tried to fuck me in the ass with her black and when i explained the story the emotions of  of actually knowing that a dick was forced into my ass because i had suction it didn't go in it  it went in enough for me to go ah i don't know i don't like it so it did almost it got right up 
[03:00:00]  against the sphincter yeah like it didn't actually did it there was there was a pucker  suction okay yeah yeah there's enough there's enough to bother you yeah they could say you could  say i've been in the ass opening up a little bit it started opening up a little bit  to accept yeah wow and i cried and he didn't get the wart cluster no no warts i'd rather a black dick  than assboards see he's gay see he's gay look at that he had gay sex that counts as gay i tell you

[03:08:00]  i'm panicking bring your guys in i've got my co-host he's never been electrocuted you'll feel it and be  like oh that was get raw dog in here he'll do it okay i can take it off at any time no what do you  mean the fuck is that play the game motherfucker it stays on until the game is over that's fucking  raw this is raw dog hey i know you hey how's it going guys i don't know why you're listening to the  show why don't you fuck off over there go over here uh stevie's yeah hey raw dog is a uh he's my 
[03:08:30]  co-host and uh he's a true competitor uh he's uh he's a trooper yeah he's uh he's told his stories  he's he's revealed because you know i'm on my show because we don't we're desperate for attention so  we tell each we tell everybody everything we've ever done as i just told you yeah it's by a black man  yes uh he fingers himself in the ass on a regular basis purely a hygienic thing  if you're in the shower you've got to like oh yeah we're all fingering each other in the  fucking shower now jimmy norton has said he does this well no he cleans his ass and he 
[03:09:00]  needs to get in there a little bit he does some soap on his finger and wraps around yeah he likes  to make sure the ass is nice and clean i take a washcloth and give it a good once over but it  doesn't sound that bad when you say it right but for some reason when raw dog fucks himself in the  morning it sounds weird to me way up there or anything yeah it's not going way up yeah yeah  does it make you calm oh he's it no you're even you're tipping it i'm tipping it you're just the  very the very but it's an in-out thing though why are you doing that because that area it's 
[03:09:30]  got to be clean otherwise you're really uncomfortable throughout the day what about this technique i  told him that he was you know when he confessed that he was fucking himself uh everybody got weird  about it so then for a couple months he used the grabbing both the ass cheeks and pulling them  apart and bending over and getting the shower head to squirt in there to clean the hole  ah wow you're like dude just fuck yourself yeah that was probably a worse technique your logic  doesn't make sense what if you what if you take a dump at work you're going to the bathroom and  but then you got toilet paper and stuff so you're fucking figuring your ass at work too 
[03:10:00]  do you take the toilet paper you think yourself at work no he just said it  no he says there's toilet paper but how are you wrapping toilet paper around your fingers and  shoving it you're getting in there hell no dude no it's just you you don't have toilet paper in  the shower you have it when you go to the bathroom though it's totally different yeah you're going  in a little bit don't you just have them sometimes he's going in at home the the moistened wipe  things at home do you ever get the skids um skid mark on the towel he's got better when you've  washed yourself like you got like you haven't had a shit lately but yeah like a shit like four hours

[03:33:00]  as soon as i pulled this out he was like let's go and we went out into the green room because we  couldn't get enough of a wind up in the studio so i i i i'm like i'll hit you and then we'll  reciprocate blah blah blah so i hit him kind of hard and then we do it again and the third time i  fucking went into him you know i mean i went down on his leg i was like bam and i looked him in the  face and he and because his thing was to do exactly what i did it doesn't hurt so he just looked at  me and went okay then so then right there i was like fuck i always know when those killer people do  that yeah when people who are because it because i can kind of fight like compared to him and jim or 
[03:33:30]  whatever i could kill you guys yeah yeah he said i couldn't fight but you're normal people in and  in the in the fighting world i am steve right to forrest griffin i'm steve you're steve yeah you're a  little stevie and steve is hitting uh me and and and staring him down going did that fucking hurt  shitbag oh no so forrest goes because they all do it chocolate dells they all do the same thing they go  oh yeah okay sounds good and then i know because they go cold they've got a dark face it's like 
[03:34:00]  something that happens when you're being stabbed in the neck and somebody's fucking you and you're  saying no and you're trying to fucking get their fucking um mask to come off so you can identify  them when you wake up in hospital their soul goes away it's that fucking face it drains right out of  man i always have to drag that face out of these fucking tough so what ended up happening wait did he  cranked it from above like from above up here holy and went down it was a it was a downwards chop  onto the onto the back of the carpet it missed one and just got the other one on the end and i had 
[03:34:30]  like a fucking it goes it goes in it's not like it doesn't it's like if you get punched in the face  or you get kicked and need you feel it later this one's an an it's a sting that goes into your bones  you know if you ever fucking hit your ass running you know i don't skate or anything but sometimes i fall  skating not anymore because i'm washed up but my ass will hit one cheek will hit and the other  cheek will keep going because you go so fast when your foot comes up one stays and the other one  fucking goes like three feet the other one's firmly planted into the fucking cement so it's just a 
[03:35:00]  fucking rink and you and oh you like you fuck the sky and click and click you know and put your  fucking tailbone inside your own ass and and put you know pull the fucking it's the inside pain it's like  an inside yeah yeah yeah deep inside your pelvis like i snapped my tailbone off one time that was  the that i hear that is like the worst it's the fucking most amazing uh because the hospital can't  do anything about it i had the x-ray anything it did would get me laid a little bit i had an x-ray 
[03:35:30]  of my because my tailbone snapped off so there's like a gap and then my little fucking tail floating  by itself and i had the x-ray and i put it in my bathroom through the the light took the ceiling lights  out and i had that there so i would show chicks i'd take them back to my house where see that  that's my tailbone i don't have a tailbone it's floating just floating in there you can touch it  you can move around it's no big deal that got you a little bit probably yeah well i was talking  whores all right i'm looking for a long-term relationship a professional skateboarder over 
[03:36:00]  here i think i love you i always think if they come back to your house you get them into the bathroom  they're going to fuck you anyway i gotta be honest the x-ray is probably not the clincher  mine was maybe i had it before i knew it but my thing was the barbecue i would say let's go for a  barbecue oh yeah instead of saying can you jack me off in my bathroom it was barbecue first my thing  was always rape you had that on your wall or something that was my closer 
[03:36:30]  holy shit right the fuck unbelievable man so you know all australians are not the same  hot fucking hardcore man they've always said yes that uh you getting hit with on that with 10  on the shock collar yeah well the dude we've got him on 10 in that boxing fight right the  fuck down and that's the that's the word because in the boxing fight after the first five minutes you  can't feel the shock collar anymore it only because it goes because it's on your spine it just makes  your legs your legs give out for just a second it's not really that painful you just fall to your knees 
[03:37:00]  so every time i was in that fire blindfolded i right when i'm i would finally get somebody because  you can't tell until somebody touches elbows as soon as your elbow bumps into someone else it's  the fucking haymaker of doom that's all you're gonna do yeah we did blind boxing years ago it's  insane with real blind people with real blind people one guy popped his eyes out for the fight  what just to prove he was real real okay they can't he took him out before the fight yeah  they were glass eyes right he goes no i'll prove it he wasn't just a guy with vision who really 
[03:37:30]  wanted to be on the show well you never know it is a big show you never know i mean you know  but the one guy got fucked up bad fucking spleen yeah broken ribs he didn't see it i see see i got  because you don't know when the punches coming so you don't protect yourself see it's different the  way i organize ellis manias is there's usually one fight on the card where somebody could get knocked  out but i don't use i don't let people fight each other that are over 200 pounds that don't know how to  fight and it's it's uh always the rocks out if you're if you're blindfolded and you're being  electrocuted you tense up so you fight all tense right and i mean there's so there's never really 
[03:38:00]  a chance to really open up and in our one the usually they're professional fighters in the dog  collar fight now because it did get a little so so what what is the dog follow quite exactly it's  four dudes with dog cop these dog colors and they're blindfolded they've got headgear on and 16  ounce gloves right when the bell goes here on it's a bit faggy of them isn't it all right yeah  you're a pretty manly guy i've seen you take a punch have you have you seen me take a punch yeah 
[03:38:30]  you come alive don't you no have you have you seen it yeah it's a real video yeah you're an animal  i gotta give myself credit well i didn't know i was in a fight because you can tell i don't know okay  it's a fucked up i tell you if you're on stage and a guy comes out of the dark into the spotlight and  you don't know he doesn't even yell anything i defy anyone to fight back i don't really  quickly but it's what you did after the punch is is the bit that that uh sucked cow but i don't  blame i don't blame you everybody does it but you went you had you don't know because you don't 
[03:39:00]  train you don't have anything but when he punched you it wasn't that good of a punch you were completely  conscious and you took a knee and and went into a little bit of a fetal position may i add that i  didn't drop the microphone but in the fetal you were down next to his legs you could have double  leg but i can we can we give credit where credit's too i came out and finished the  fucking gig as a comic that's impressive you didn't get knocked out you know what you could  have fucking punched them you could have you could have you when you went down you were at his shins 
[03:39:30]  you could have grabbed his legs put him on his back he's fucking punched him in his balls yeah you  could have grabbed these balls and pulled them off you could have sucked this car that would have been  funny i didn't know i was a ticket to your next gig this guy's sucking dick on stage he's a maniac  and i'll tell you what else i didn't press any charges either wow what a man please ask me  please ask me if i wanted to and i said no that's pretty tough that's tough yeah you know you know  a guy that walks out on stage and punches comedians in the face no i just let the cunt go home because 
[03:40:00]  he's drunk and i've had a drink before and acted like an arsehole and that's how i looked at it all  right and also my career took off from that day i really i was in the news that night oh look look  at what's on here the youtube sensation jim jeffries the old spelling of jim jeffries that shows how old  he is someone really produced you're beating you make the most of it well produced jim jeffries 
[03:40:30]  it's pretty good for security footage that's pushing it inwards  oh i still have that shirt oh hang on jesus man it's uh  one hell of a response oh look there is a single leg  for a single leg yeah and then the people came in and then i was like oh you ran right  where'd you get where'd you go into the dressing room for what to chat to chat with the other  comics to chat with the other comics yeah hey jason that wasn't that bad it wasn't as bad  for the one way okay may i also add if you watch the first thing i say before i'm hit is oh hang 
[03:41:00]  on a second that's how much of a shock it is to me you got blindsided there but you kept looking  down he didn't he didn't heckle or anything and i even tried to raise a guy huh and he came out of  the darkness into the spotlight whoa i almost got you with the last see see the first punch you can't  what what are you looking in his shoes for see all right now you're trying to take him down that was  good i was fine i didn't drop the mic as well why did this guy that's very important did it ever 
[03:41:30]  come out um i i did a pedophilic joke he had some issues oh and he was a pedophile  he had some issues or he was on a first date or something and the girl that he was with had issues  and an asshole but he never heckled see i've had plenty of times in my career where someone goes oh  i'm gonna come up and i see it coming i always do that sort of stance where i'm gonna kick them in  the face as they get up onto the the stage is the best thing but he just ran up he never saw a  comment and an affliction t-shirt on too which does make it dangerous but you took you took a few 
[03:42:00]  punches though before you you kind of realized i gotta do can we can we play the standing ovation  when i come back out though that's that's that's what's important here that's what's important because  i got a black eye and i still fucking come back out yeah he got you with a shot absolutely one or two  shots he got was that the emcee yeah emcee doesn't know what the fuck all right ladies and german yeah  took a while on stage for eight minutes so he's gone all right the wanker wanker yeah all right 
[03:42:30]  all right that's not gonna help really all right but jim is jim's gonna come back and finish his set  for you would that be great if you came out and another guy came up and just started rolling on  your fucking head and then another guy started sucking your car when you're out when i came out not  everyone was happy to see me yeah no there was still booming out there there were some people in  that audience who were taking the punches to finish up welcome back jim jeffries 
[03:43:00]  damn look at that yeah a little bit of a standing ovation i'm the worst high fiver in the world look  at that one yeah it is a sloppy well you've just been in a big fight yeah  he did the best he could he looked like he was a bit of a weightlifting guy probably best to keel over  now the thing is if you if you listen to this now oh yeah okay i now see his little cut there 
[03:43:30]  uh i'm not now we cut that out because i knew he was irish and i went a little bit racist  i had a four-minute rant where i went fucking patty cunt  irish fuck and then because they didn't have the rest of the footage people would think that i'd  caused the fight so we thought edit that little bit out good idea yeah yeah because it's sometimes  irish people in ireland they have a little bit of uh in my opinion they have a little bit of uh 
[03:44:00]  oh we're just great for the crack you know we're really up for it and we're a lot of fun and all  that but you say one irish joke and they're swinging punches yeah i feel like irish people  and english people are good street fighters they cheat i they always headbutt i've that's that's  the closest i've been to having a fight in my entire life really i get your deal dude if you get  hit good enough it does it does make you want to go uh to the knee and and you and you forget and it's not  like you were in a heated discussion it was just i i get you he just went at me but but that's why 
[03:44:30]  i think you should go to the gym a little bit and learn learn a little bit because you would have  been able to subdue him you would have got a way bigger standing ovation if he had to punch you  in the head three times you double leg and put him on his back elbow him in the face until security  pulls you off i don't know about you but i would have been on the stage hoisting you on my shoulders  and say it's the greatest comedian that ever lived you just see the elbows i did better than not  gallagher and liam gallagher did when they rushed them in in canada i think they did better but the  thing was security came and the audience came the weird thing is that was that was filmed in manchester 
[03:45:00]  and there's about three guys say who ran up out of the crowd yeah when i went now when i go  to manchester i still sell more tickets than anywhere else in the world because i'm like punching i'm  synonymous i'm synonymous for the incident that's half a million people there that was yeah  yeah and and so i go in every time i go back but every time i go back i meet some guy who says he  was the bloke who ran up on the stage and helped me and so for the first two years i was buying all  these blokes drinks like thanks for that mate thanks for helping me out so words gotten around 
[03:45:30]  and every cut in manchester just says they were the guy who helped me out lying sacks of the funny  thing was there was um the other comics were just just watching tv and they could hear all the  commotion but they they they were watching the fight on the screen and then they knew that i was  coming backstage they turned to another channel oh like they didn't see it acted like they couldn't  see it and they went so how did the how did they go out there get punched themselves i go not good 
[03:46:00]  there's this one really arrogant comic called michael mcintyre who's hugely famous there now and i said  not good we've got not good michael they just punched me in the face and he went no one can  follow me i might get punched in the face doing something uh doing some stand-up organize it so  i could do a uh like a kill up thing have you ever done stand-up or yeah yeah like no just like two  times two times the second time i did it i did it this carrie hart roast thing was like a private  thing for carrie and pink and those people right and uh who's the dude that's uh funny because he's good 
[03:46:30]  looking that would be me uh you know maybe somebody here a little harder is gonna say it  everyone thinks that's who it is dane cook's not that good looking man i think he's an attractive  guy for how funny he is beside the point colin cain's a good looking guy i've roasted carrie hart  and then he came out and said uh round of applause i don't know if this is a comedy thing they say  to make you feel good but i was the funniest person in the building oh they're saying so i'm funnier  than dane cook but like i said that's not a huge yeah that's well done tough crap all right let's
