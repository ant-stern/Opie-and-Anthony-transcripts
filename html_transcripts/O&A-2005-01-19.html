<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a spoken-word piece about pain and anger, followed by repeated declarations of "The O&A virus."  The hosts then playfully argued over who was anchoring a segment discussing a supermodel's wedding dress before shifting to a discussion about the extremely cold New York City weather.  Opie described his girlfriend's nephew wiping a booger on his couch, leading to a disgusted discussion about the unsanitary state of his furniture.  A caller, Chris the Trucker, contributed anecdotes about children and messes.  The hosts then promoted "Whip Em Out Wednesday," a segment encouraging women to flash their breasts at drivers with the WOW insignia, and addressed listener mail and issues with WOW sticker distribution, taking several calls containing humorous and off-color remarks.

The show continued with news headlines, focusing on two cold-weather deaths in New York City (a homeless man and a nanny), Mike Piazza's wedding, and the Iraq War. Opie and Anthony expressed cynicism about the media's coverage, particularly the perceived downplaying of terrorism post-election.  They then discussed a luxurious new Airbus plane, questioning its practicality and the airport infrastructure's ability to handle it, digressing into a discussion about writer Voss getting a manicure, and a seeing-eye dog defecating on a basketball court.  They also mocked the media's portrayal of Brad Pitt's heartbreak and discussed a news story about a woman with Down syndrome being raped, concluding the segment with more cold-weather discussion and calls and mentioning Ralphie May as a scheduled guest.  A local news report about the cold weather was played and mocked.

A significant portion of the broadcast focused on the extremely cold weather, the deaths related to it, and the VH1 show *Celebrity Fit Club*, specifically criticizing Mia Tyler's behavior and appearance using offensive language.  The hosts also discussed *American Idol*, mocking the contestants' lack of talent and Simon Cowell's critiques.  A Playboy issue review followed, featuring sexually explicit comments about the centerfold and other models.  A "Wow Sticker Stop" advertisement aired.  The hosts received a "Newsmaker of the Year" award from RadioDailyNews.com, reacting sarcastically.  Audio clips from *Celebrity Fit Club* and *American Idol* were played, along with an Eminem and Paul McCartney mash-up.

The next segment heavily featured clips of bad singers auditioning for an *American Idol*-like show, with Opie, Anthony, and studio guest Ralphie May reacting with amusement and disgust.  The hosts offered sarcastic “judges' comments,” discussing whether the singers were genuinely unaware or playing up their awfulness.  The conversation included tangents about William Hung, racist jokes targeting Asians, graphic descriptions of a contestant's "camel toe," and comparisons to more deserving celebrities.  Ralphie May shared experiences on *Celebrity Fit Club*, including anecdotes about *Last Comic Standing*, the show's editing, Mia Tyler's behavior, and a humorous incident involving a dog stepping on his penis while he was on Viagra. The segment concluded with plugs for Ralphie May's shows and a brief, humorous, and off-color exchange between the hosts.

A subsequent segment consisted primarily of listener-submitted "F.U." messages filled with profanity directed at various people and institutions.  Listeners detailed personal grievances.  Advertisements for a "Better Sex Kit" and XM satellite radio aired.  With Ralphie May in studio, the conversation shifted to his schedule, comedy club appearances, and *Celebrity Fit Club*. They discussed a video of a woman named China, using highly graphic and sexually explicit language.  A caller, Tom from New Orleans, discussed incidents involving bouncers and deaths, recounted the show's Mardi Gras broadcast from a strip club, and a cancelled planned blowjob by a woman called the "blowjob queen."  The conversation touched upon the tsunami, with insensitive jokes from the hosts and Ralphie May, who shared anecdotes from Thailand about the sex trade and tourists' reactions. A video of police brutality was briefly shown and discussed.  The segment concluded with a detailed, humorous, and exasperated discussion of an upcoming Opie and Anthony show broadcast itinerary from the XM compound in Washington, D.C., focusing on the hosts' frustration with the many scheduled meetings, including sensitivity training for Jim Norton.

The final segment focused on the hosts' frustration with an overwhelming schedule of meetings planned by XM Satellite Radio in Washington, D.C.  They believed the meetings were pointless and time-wasting, contrasting intended marketing meetings with meetings with various corporate departments.  Caller Lori from Wisconsin expressed sympathy, sharing her corporate experience.  The hosts detailed their desire for productive marketing to improve the show's reach, particularly its placement on a premium channel.  Comedic moments included sarcastic suggestions for productive meetings and humorous calls from listeners, including Bill from Texas. Jim Norton was present.  Additional callers shared thoughts and suggestions, with one advocating for creating chaos to escape the meetings.  Advertisements for XM radio and Ralphie May's shows aired.  The hosts reiterated their concerns about unproductive meetings, their desire to improve the show's marketing and reach, and their frustration with XM's apparent lack of understanding.

[00:05:00]  Thank you. 
[00:05:30]  Thank you. 
[00:06:00]  Average citizens, average heroes, quietly and anonymously continuing to make the world  a better place.  Controversial talkers Opie and Anthony.  We are just...  You better just sit back and watch. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  Wait, what?  The Opie and Anthony show.  Oh!  But enough of this palaver.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Can you see this?  Can you see this?  Can you see this?  Can you see this?  Something would cost about a hundred grand.  Here's a look at the wedding dress made for a supermodel.  Well, let's go.  I'm not going to announce the future, Mr.  Let's go over that name again, Steve. 
[00:07:00]  What was that?  You know what?  Why don't you do it, Bill?  No, I'm not the anchor, Steve.  That's Melania, right?  Why don't you go over?  What are you doing?  I'm not the anchor.  Well, you know what, then?  Put that part down over there during the video.  Oh, do it, Bill.  It has 300 feet of satin.  If you're not the anchor, then don't interrupt me.  I just...  I wanted to know what you said.  If you're not the anchor, then don't...  Go, baby.  Go.  Go.  The guy was designed by John Galliano.  I'm not for fixing your...  And the bride finds another dress of your wing design after the couple's first dance wedding 
[00:07:30]  is set for Saturday.  Why don't you give it a shot, then, Bill?  Hey.  I'm just representing the audience.  I heard...  I heard...  My bad, my bad.  I'm sorry, Bill.  I'm not looking for an apology.  I know something about the shot.  I'm just saying, would you like to take another shot?  No, I wouldn't.  I don't know.  I can't take a shot at it.  That's why I do the weather.  I don't read that stuff.  It is so cold outside.  It is cold outside.  It's cold in here, too.  Take a shot at the weather if you want.  That's fine. 
[00:08:00]  I'm good with that.  Hey, dude.  Okay.  I get paid either way.  Oh, here, here, here.  It's such cold in the weather to start today.  And it will be a day where it will be a cold day.  It's going to be right around zero.  And welcome to the O.P. and Anthony program.  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  Good morning.  Here we go.  Is it a good morning?  Is it, Anthony?  Not really.  Ugh.  It is effing cold.  And we're going to just whine and cry. 
[00:08:30]  This is a national radio show, so why the hell are we broadcasting from a frigid climate?  That really doesn't make much sense.  We can broadcast from anywhere.  Why are we here when it's single digits, as they say, single digits?  What is it out there?  Eight or something?  Well, I'm looking at the TV.  It's a whopping 11 now.  Oh, it's 11?  Ooh.  Yeah, when we woke up, it was a lot, well, not a lot colder.  A few degrees colder, so.  Yeah.  And I don't want to hear about Minnesota. 
[00:09:00]  Shut up.  Shut up.  Cold is cold.  That it's, what, 20-something below?  Well, I guess yesterday it was like, I don't know, 54 below zero.  That's their problem.  With the wind chill factor.  I'm not there.  I'm here.  What's the difference?  When you get down to single digits, whatever, it's just bragging rights after that, right?  Yeah, exactly.  Because no one's really doing anything outside.  No.  You know, I'm going stir-crazy.  I'm a little different than Anthony.  I can't just hang out in my apartment all day.  I like to hibernate. 
[00:09:30]  I need to be out on the street.  I need to be, like, inline skating in Central Park.  In 11-degree weather?  Well, that's what I'm saying.  I can't do anything.  I could do stuff, if it's 30, I could still do stuff outside.  30?  Yeah, easily.  30 is a piece of cake.  I like 60.  60's good.  Then I could start venturing out of the cave.  But, no.  Are you kidding?  No, you're not kidding.  I know you.  What am I saying?  30 is still cold.  I know, but you could get some warmer clothes on and you could handle it. 
[00:10:00]  I'm not saying it's a treat.  It's a pain in the ass.  Just going out is a pain.  It takes forever to get dressed.  In the summer, what does it take?  Five minutes, you're out the door.  Right.  With this, you're like, oh, you're putting those stupid layers on.  You've got to dress in layers, hoping.  And it's funny.  You need one stupid thing from the store or something.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, you're like, yeah.  You're putting all your layers back on.  It's an ordeal.  And your clothes and your hats and your gloves and not scarves, but whatever. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  Walk out.  Just get the milk.  Then come back in.  Then take it all off.  Then you realize you forgot something else.  Like, oh, what a pain in the ass.  Big pain in the ass.  And I'm discovering all the drafts in my apartment.  Yeah.  Those things become really obvious when you pass by them when it's 11 degrees out.  Yeah.  At 30, 40, you don't really notice as much.  No, no.  You know, the heat takes care of all that.  Yeah.  Kind of heats it up.  You crank up the heat a little higher.  It takes care of all the drafty areas.  You don't really notice.  But when it gets out of single digits, you notice that maybe you should have, I don't 
[00:11:00]  know, put plastic on the window.  Yeah.  Or maybe that crack that leads to the outside there.  Maybe you need a towel or something underneath that.  Jam it in there.  You pass by and you just feel like there's frigid air on your crotch.  And who needs insulation under the cabinets in the kitchen?  Duh!  Duh!  Duh!  So.  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  At least I was able to get my vehicle out of the garage today.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah.  We need an update on that.  How's the...  Oh, house guests gone. 
[00:11:30]  Out?  They left.  Left last night.  But not before one more little thing happened.  My girlfriend's sister and her husband and three kids were over.  Two boys, about, you know, seven, I guess six, seven, something like that.  And then a girl who's like one year old.  Just figuring out how to walk, right?  I'm like a toddler just figuring that teetering toddler walk around my sharp-edged furniture  and tile floors. 
[00:12:00]  Like no carpet on some of the floors that I have.  It's just like concrete tile.  Just waiting to go down.  Oh, just waiting to leave a dent in that soft spot.  Just awful.  I have the most dangerous baby house ever.  So, you know, my girlfriend's sister and the younger boy and the girl went shopping,  which left me at the house with the husband and the older boy.  It's like seven years old around there. 
[00:12:30]  And we're watching a movie.  We're all sitting on the couch watching a movie.  And I'm thinking you're thinking that, eh, this isn't too bad.  I'm sitting here.  Not too bad.  I have no idea what you're about to say.  They're not screaming around the house.  I know it's going to be bad.  But you're sitting there maybe enjoying a beer, bonding a little bit with the dude  and his older son, right?  You know, I was just watching the movie with them.  Just sitting watching the movie.  No small talk.  You know, I like watching movies. 
[00:13:00]  When a movie's on, I like just watching the movie.  I don't like a lot of talk during movies, to tell you the truth.  I just want to watch.  You have nothing in common with this guy.  No, no.  Hey, man, I can read between the lines.  You don't have to say a thing, Anthony.  I'm an all-around kind of guy.  I talk to all people.  How long did it take when your girlfriend left with her sister and the two other kids  where you realized, uh-oh, I better find a movie? 
[00:13:30]  No, actually, he brought in some movies.  He's brought in some movies.  All right.  So maybe he's thinking the same thing.  Sure.  You know, just pop a movie in.  Makes things easy.  So we're watching the movie.  And he asks his son, he goes, what are you doing?  So I'm sitting there like, I'm just watching the movie, watching the movie.  He goes, I'm picking my nose.  You know, kids, they don't care.  They'll just say anything. 
[00:14:00]  He goes, I'm picking my nose.  And then I hear, did you wipe that on Anthony's couch?  You're hanging out with Randy Quaid and his kids, dude.  So they packed up the RV and got out of town.  And the kid goes, yup, yup.  What were you honestly thinking inside?  Oh my God, the kid just wiped a booger on my couch.  Because you hate, I mean, no one likes that type of thing, but you absolutely, dude, you 
[00:14:30]  lose your mind.  We have audio of me saying, snot, besides crap, snot is the most disgusting thing in  life to me.  I can't handle it.  If I blow my nose, I can't look at my own.  I have to be in front of a mirror when I blow my nose to make sure every bit is gone.  You never ate your own booger?  Oh, God damn, no, never.  See, I just want to get a reaction. 
[00:15:00]  Never, ever, ever.  Not once?  Nope.  Snot has always disgusted me, even as a small child.  I freak out.  I've said it on this show many times.  I can't stand it.  And when he goes, what are you doing?  And the kid goes, pick up my nose.  Did you just wipe a booger on Anthony's couch?  Yup.  And then he goes, well, find it.  So now the kid is searching between the crack and the couch trying to find his booger. 
[00:15:30]  And I'm just, I'm blocked on the movie.  I'm not looking at it.  I'm like, I cannot, I cannot function.  I couldn't believe it.  I couldn't speak.  I'm just watching, I guess it was, yeah, The Day After Tomorrow, that was the one on.  I thought you were watching, I thought you were watching Boogie Nights.  Boogie Nights.  Oh! 
[00:16:00]  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  That's zany.  No, it was The Day After Tomorrow.  And, um...  Yeah.  Yeah, he, I never, by the way, never found the booger.  Nice.  So now...  Knowing you, you're going to throw the whole couch out.  Much like Seinfeld.  Yeah, I have to throw my couch out.  I didn't even have to ask.  I know, if someone's looking for a really nice couch with one lousy booger in it somewhere...  With a booger somewhere.  We should just give the address of where you're living, and they can come by with a truck and 
[00:16:30]  pick it up.  Take it away free of charge.  It's all yours.  I know you, and he's not lying.  Oh, I will have a new couch as soon as possible.  That couch is gone.  Because, first of all, I can sit on it, but I can only sit on an area that's nowhere near  the Ground Zero booger area.  Right.  And as far as laying down and reclining on it, over that crack, you know, the modular 
[00:17:00]  crack that I was in...  But do you realize what other stuff is on your couch?  Seriously.  Have you had people sleep over and stuff?  Yeah.  I got foreign stains on my couch, and I'm like, what the hell are people doing on this couch  when they sleep over?  Really?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  You mean couples are sleeping on your couch?  Because then they are having sex on your couch.  Right, exactly.  And making...  Exactly.  That is probably the rudest thing you can do when staying over someone's other, especially 
[00:17:30]  sleeping on the couch.  There's a bender over the coffee table or something.  That could be, you know, clean with some Windex.  And stupid me, I got a very light-colored couch, so everything...  You know, you got a brown couch, eh, do what you want on it, I'll never see it.  Yeah.  But, you know, it's an off-white kind of thing.  Mine's like a light gray with a green booger somewhere on it.  I have no clue where it is.  Oh, that is gross, man.  Yeah, people that stay over your house and do things like that, having sex on your couch,  that's pretty rude.  Well, there was two, like, nasty spots. 
[00:18:00]  I thought it was the old splooge stains.  Yeah.  But I scrubbed and scrubbed and scrubbed, and they're still there, so now I'm thinking it  might be just a little grease from Chinese food or something, thank God.  You think?  Well, what else could it be?  It could be splooge.  Nah, I think you could wash that out pretty much.  No, no, that don't come out.  There's that little border area of the stain that won't come out, where it's kind of wicked  to the side, and all the proteins and everything kind of collected on the edge of it.  Chris the Trucker wants in on this. 
[00:18:30]  Chris, go ahead, buddy.  Yeah, Anthony.  Yes, sir.  Can you hear me?  Of course I can.  Hey, Anthony.  Yeah.  Chris.  He can't hear me?  Oh, come on.  Buttons?  Chris.  Buttons?  Yeah, Anthony.  Yeah.  Yeah, hey, that's the only one you know about.  What about the rest of the house?  Oh, the kid, yeah, maybe for two days they was there.  You had three kids there?  Maybe they were wiping boogers everywhere.  Yeah, hey, I got four kids, and I tell you, they do a little bit of sick of everything. 
[00:19:00]  Yep, time to find a new house, Anthony.  Oh, my God.  Time to get a maid service in there and clean up the whole thing.  There you go.  You should have seen.  That's true, actually.  There's probably boogers all over your house.  Oh, my God.  You should have seen my girlfriend going nuts.  She went around the house with disinfectant stuff and cleaning stuff, and I was like, what are you doing?  She goes, kids with meat hands just touching everything, like freaking out. 
[00:19:30]  She's a vegetarian, but not crazy vegetarian, where if she sees me eating a burger or something, she's going to freak out.  But the fact that the kids, you know how kids are when they eat hamburgers?  It just gets all over their hands.  And then they're walking around, like, touching stuff, and she doesn't want to be grabbing a faucet, you know, and just have this greasy burger juice on the faucet.  So she's running around like a mad woman.  Tina!  Clean this up!  You guys are like that couple from National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. 
[00:20:00]  Margo and that other dude.  Really?  Yeah, the neighbors.  I don't remember that.  It's all about just you two.  You don't want any kids around.  We are.  You don't want anyone touching your stuff.  We are the most selfish people.  What's the other guy's name in that?  Because I know the famous line is, I don't know Margo.  Yeah.  Oh, Todd.  Todd?  You're Todd and Margo.  Todd and Margo.  From National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. 
[00:20:30]  I consider myself like a generous person when it comes to, like, what I have.  Things like that.  Then I'm fine.  But we are two of the most selfish, self-centered people when it just comes to our own convenience and things.  Like, we enjoy just leave us alone.  Any little shaking up of my daily routines just gets me crazy. 
[00:21:00]  You guys are better known as loners.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Pretty much.  That's pretty much it.  We have our life and that's what we enjoy.  I don't want boogers on my couch.  Ah, she doesn't want grease on the faucets.  Yeah.  Well, no.  The computer was pretty good.  I think they knew that was pretty much, you know, off limits.  That's my salvation there.  Although I'm trying to play, like, Battlefield 1942. 
[00:21:30]  And, you know, he, like, the little kid likes watching, which is fine.  But occasionally, like, I'm trying to do stuff and he's so close that he's, like, bumping my arm.  And I'm trying to kill somebody.  And, like, I miss and I'm just creamed.  Look over.  Oh, man.  Hey, maybe you shouldn't bump my arm while I'm trying to kill the gook here.  You were in hell for two or three days.  I just know you were definitely in hell.  Oh, the kids all left last, you know, they all left last night. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  And after they all left, I was like, oh, what is that, a week?  Oh, that's brutal.  And my chick's like, no, it's, you know, two days.  We're not like company people.  I know, man.  You don't have to tell me.  You know, we have still two full rooms that just have nothing in them.  The living room itself.  You don't even set them up for it?  The formal living room.  They're not even set up for company.  Nothing.  It's a wide, expansive carpeting. 
[00:22:30]  The dining room, the formal, like, dining room, nothing in there.  And that's why they had room to, ah, just run and yell through the house.  So, no, we're not meant for company.  We're not built for company.  And that's just the way it is.  Stay away.  Yeah, we're like, we're very inconvenient to be around.  All right.  Well, it's Whip Em Out Wednesday.  We got to go through this speech one more time.  Plow through this.  Plow through this one more time.  Like it's the first time. 
[00:23:00]  But it is.  Do it like it's 1995.  Yeah, I think we started this in 95, 96 probably.  Yeah.  I mean, it's warm somewhere, Anthony.  And it is a great concept.  It's called WOW, which stands for Whip Em Out Wednesday.  And we heard from a fine lady from Jersey yesterday who wanted to WOW a trucker.  But unfortunately, I cursed this weather.  She couldn't get all her clothes off in time.  And she called up to apologize to that trucker.  But so it does happen big time.  Hey, how about that new Soundgarden album? 
[00:23:30]  Oh, yeah.  I'm just trying to make it sound like, you know, 10 years ago.  They should have been one with butt trumpets or Orange 9mm.  I don't think Soundgarden's putting out anything new, are they?  No, you're right.  It's kind of old.  All right.  There were better references.  Hey, Chili Peppers Pearl Jam Tour.  Nice.  So it does work.  It's Whip Em Out Wednesday.  Oh, yeah.  And basically, you put WOW in your car.  And if the ladies see the WOW and they feel like it, they will flash their boobs on the 
[00:24:00]  highway.  Freeze their nips off.  Yeah.  So basically, you could write WOW in the back of your truck.  If you've got the dirty truck, or you could make homemade WOW signs, which we'd like to  see.  Or you could get a fine, official, Opie and Anthony Whip Em Out Wednesday bumper sticker,  Anthony.  I love seeing those around.  And basically, that's what you're doing right now, the WOW mail?  It's coming in every day right here.  Look at Eric working diligently.  Right here in New York City.  So what's the address?  You send a cell phone.  We make it really easy.  I mean, we have the system set up in Washington that, quite frankly, failed miserably. 
[00:24:30]  They're trying to claim that it didn't.  But people waited a really long time for their WOW stickers.  So we took it upon ourselves to just tell you guys to just send your self-addressed stamped  envelopes to us, and we'll send out the WOW stickers immediately.  So the address is what?  11 West 57th Street, Suite 500, New York, New York, 10019.  Attention, WOW stickers.  All right.  And you can write XM Satellite Radio or something like that on that.  You can put Sweet Face 500.  It goes right to Steve.  Yeah. 
[00:25:00]  So don't do that.  And that address is up on OpieAndAnthony.com, I believe, as well.  So you can go there after the show or during the show.  Whatever.  Let's say hi to Tom in Philly.  Tom, what's up?  Hey, boys.  How you doing this morning?  Pretty good.  I had a suggestion for Anthony.  Next time those little shit stains come over, you're going to have Opie come over and kick  one of them in the liver.  You can't be kicking children in the liver.  Yeah.  Why would I do that, sir?  Why would I do that?  Hey, Chester, Chester, where are you? 
[00:25:30]  All right.  What are you doing downstairs?  Mike in Kansas, what's up?  Mike.  Yeah.  What's going on, Mike?  I can barely hear you.  Why?  What's going on with the volume on the phones today?  I just had a suggestion for that couch.  You could bring it into the studio there and make a new lesbian couch out of it.  The lesbian booger couch?  Yeah.  Dude, it's one booger.  Yeah, but that's quite enough.  One booger is all it takes. 
[00:26:00]  So what did the guy say?  Because finally the search had to be called off.  He did.  The search for the booger was called off.  It's now a recovery.  Yeah.  Well, the search and rescue was called off.  Yeah, called off.  And now it's just a recovery.  Well, he just said, well, apologize to Anthony.  And, you know, the kid says, I'm sorry.  But, you know, the booger's still there.  Didn't the kid know where he put the booger there?  You know, kids, he dug deep.  And then he shoved his hand, like, between the crack and the couch. 
[00:26:30]  And then wiped the booger down there.  So I guess when he looked for it, it had already probably, like, come off.  I'm getting grossed out.  And now it's, like, under the cushion.  I'm sure if I look around, but I don't want to look around because I don't want to find it.  That's something I don't want to find.  Who wants to find a booger?  All right.  Well, we've got a lot of things to do today.  Where's Mr. Glister today? 
[00:27:00]  Who?  Oh, Jimmy?  A little chubby.  I didn't even notice he wasn't here.  Was he supposed to be here?  Or is he doing a gig?  No, he overslept.  He should be here.  He slept?  He overslept.  Wow.  He should be here any moment.  I knew he was going to be.  He called me at, like, 7.  Said he slept all day because he's adjusting his schedule because he's got to do some, you know,  spots around New York City to get ready for maybe another Tonight Show appearance.  Yeah.  He's been going crazy.  So now I'm thinking, oh, man, now you're screwed.  How are you going to stay up from 7 all the way to, you know, 6 in the morning? 
[00:27:30]  Can't do that.  Anyway, Anthony, we've got Ralphie May coming in.  A good friend of ours.  He's on that Celebrity Fit Club.  Celebrity Fat Club.  He'll be in at 7.30 and, yeah, we've got lots to get to today.  Lots and lots of news stories and, oh, yeah, American Idol.  Oh, yeah, premiered last night.  I'm just looking at our list of things that I want to just talk about real fast here.  Collection of delusional emotional wrecks.  Got to talk about Brad Pitt, Mike Piazza. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, there's my coffee.  Now I can function.  Thank you.  A lot of misconceptions about Mike Piazza, apparently.  Yeah, why don't we take a break?  We'll get into, you know, what people are talking about here in New York.  We'll look at the front pages of all the newspapers.  Oh.  By the way, we're trying to start something, but there's only two papers that you can get the front pages of.  Online?  Yeah, because we're trying to get, like, we want to see, like, what other cities are talking about on their front page. 
[00:28:30]  Uh-huh.  But we can only find, like, the Philly paper and the Boston paper.  That's it.  That's it across the whole country?  What about L.A.?  I don't know.  So, there must be a way maybe our listeners could email us, you know, the front page of their local newspapers.  Got to be.  Like, I can't imagine Los Angeles doesn't have an online newspaper that shows the front page.  Ben's been looking.  You know, we're trying to develop this bit.  You know, get the front pages of major newspapers in a lot of the bigger cities. 
[00:29:00]  And we can only get Philly and Boston so far.  That's it.  That is it.  So, all right.  Why don't we take a quick break?  Jim Norton has arrived.  Hey!  All is right with the world.  Sleepy head.  We'll get into it next.  Yeah.  We're going to take a quick break.  We got our coffee.  Are you sweating in here?  What?  No.  Why?  You're hot?  Oh, my God.  I'm dying.  It's kind of good.  Dude, I got, like, three layers on.  I got long johns on.  So do I, but...  I got ski socks on the...  Look at this.  Is it colder or warmer there than it is here? 
[00:29:30]  Because I'm by the windows, maybe?  Because if you feel the console over here, it's still cold.  Like, the marble is cold?  I don't know, yeah.  Yeah, it's colder here.  All right.  Well, Anthony, as we go to break, we played this yesterday, and we're getting a lot of requests  for it, so we'll play it again.  It's the audio of that news team in L.A.  Oh, right.  Yeah, they had a little argument before they went on the air.  Just before they went on the air, they had this exchange.  Check it out.  First segment.  It's done that way all the time.  It frequently is.  It frequently is.  Well, then we better talk about it.  Do you hear me complaining about it? 
[00:30:00]  Then we better talk about it.  Tonight I'm complaining, because tonight I said, hey.  Then we better talk about it, because I think...  All right?  If that's what you think, then we'll talk about it after the show, and we'll talk about it  with Roger Bell, because I'm not going to sit here night after night and put up  with this shit.  Okay?  Night after night?  Night after night?  Well, where...  It looks to me like that's the way it's going to go, Ann.  I'll take the ante up a little higher than that, even.  You're not only wrong, you're way out of line.  Let me tell you something. 
[00:30:30]  You started it, pal.  You want Harold Green, you might get him.  That's fine with me.  Fine with me.  Who is it really?  Good old Harold Green.  Okay.  Okay.  You want to start dealing with shit?  Go ahead.  That's what you want.  You just might get it.  You know, you go home and have a couple of shooters, and I don't know what the fuck happens,  but when you come back, you're not the same lady.  That's nuts.  Some nights it is, Ann. 
[00:31:00]  When news happens, you see it happen on Channel 7.  The number one station for news and information in Southern California.

The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Not a place called vertical.  It's everything I wish I didn't know.  It's the tool.  Give me something.  I can see you. 
[00:34:00]  Feel you.  Good morning to Jimmy Norton.  Looking very tired.  Oh, good.  You all right?  Yeah, I'm actually okay.  I'm just getting sick in there.  You can hear it in your voice.  I can see it in your peepers are all red and glassy.  Yeah.  Theraflu is like heroin.  Theraflu is great.  It's the one upside of being sick are some of the over-the-counter drugs you can take when you're sick. 
[00:34:30]  That's why I guess some people take them even when they're not sick.  Things like NyQuil and Theraflu, it's great.  You're feeling like crap because you're sick.  You take this stuff and it gives you this morphine-like, warm, buzzy feeling that you're just laying in bed.  Have you tried the Tylenol PM yet?  No.  That stuff should not be sold.  Really?  Oh, my Lord.  Good stuff.  Take a couple of those.  Yeah. 
[00:35:00]  I love the over-the-counter cold medicine.  It's amazing that they get away with this stuff.  I won't take anything with alcohol.  I can't have NyQuil.  I can't take that stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  But the Theraflu I can take, but man, it's dope.  It really is.  Gives you that warm, tingly feeling.  If I slept through the alarm and if Ben didn't call me, I'd still be knocked out.  It's all good.  It's all good.  Let's go to Larry real fast in Jersey.  See what's going on.  Larry, what's up?  Not much, man.  I just wanted to let y'all know that WOW sticker stuff works. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, yeah?  What happened to you?  I was going to East Hall 40 here in Jersey just before I got to Woodburn.  And I was on Tulane Road.  I guess she got an open view to pass me up.  And right as she got up to me, she turned the dome light on and showed me her tits.  There you go.  Very nice.  It was great, man.  Hey, I'll go.  If you put me on hold, I can talk to somebody there and give y'all some online addresses  for some newspapers out of Texas.  That's where I'm from.  If y'all want some online.  Yeah, definitely.  Yeah, we'll take that.  Get his info. 
[00:36:00]  Speaking of the front pages of the New York papers, a couple interesting things going on.  Of course, we're talking about the deadly freeze in New York City, Anthony.  Deadly freeze.  Daily News, two die in city, cold snap, more Arctic weather on the way.  I'm sure the people in Phuket can appreciate that headline.  Two dead.  Ooh, wow.  Two whole people dead, Anthony.  Deadly freeze.  I guess they were homeless people.  It's called thinning the herd. 
[00:36:30]  If you die because it's too cold out or if you die because it's too hot out.  Yeah.  Ah!  Right.  The famous nature thing.  Not all the baby turtles are going to make it to the ocean.  Some people have to leave to make room for others.  Yeah, but watch the nature shows there on Discovery.  And they show the plains of the Serengeti during the big droughts and the heat waves.  And they show the rippling horizon with maybe some water buffalo walking across, looking for that water hole somewhere. 
[00:37:00]  It can all distort it because of the heat rising up, right?  Do they all perish in that heat?  No.  But are there a few?  Two, the young one with the wobbly legs that can't quite keep up with the herd.  Or the old one that's been around for quite some time just can't seem to make it.  They'll drop, be the bleached skeletons on the plains.  Mm-hmm.  But the rest of them will make it along and find that water hole, won't they?  That's what this deadly freeze is. 
[00:37:30]  It's the same thing.  You get some homeless people sleeping in a doorway.  The smart homeless people.  Now, you wouldn't think there are any, though.  Oh, there's a lot of smart homeless people.  There are.  There are the ones with a little bit of sense.  That little one cell in their brain.  We got smart homeless people that sleep right outside the studios here.  I didn't see them.  They haven't been around lately?  No.  You know why?  Because they find shelter.  I don't know, man.  That grate, though, that they sleep over is pretty warm.  I haven't seen them on the heat and grate in the past couple of cold days. 
[00:38:00]  And I've been walking from the garage.  So proven that they're pretty smart.  They're pretty smart.  But then you get the stupid ones or the ones that maybe just are too old and feeble to find a shelter.  And they sleep in the doorways.  And the NYPD comes over, knocks them with their little nightstick, and their foot cracks off.  And it's over, Johnny.  You know?  Bury them in the potter's field in a nameless grave.  So that's what the Daily News is talking about.  The deadly freeze here in New York.  Is it five below yesterday? 
[00:38:30]  Five below yesterday.  God, oh my, it's cold.  Last night was ridiculous.  Yeah, with the wind chill, I guess, you know.  That's all they're talking about on the news.  And then the New York Post thought it was very important to tell everybody on their front page that Mike Piazza is getting married to a Baywatch babe.  I'm surprised they didn't just put it, you know.  I guess he's really.  Put what everyone wants to see.  Mike, not a homo.  I know.  That's basically what we said.  As soon as we saw it, I'm like, I guess he's not a homo after all, huh, Anthony?  That's what they're trying to say on the cover of the New York Post. 
[00:39:00]  And they got her in a little Baywatch bikini looking just unbelievable.  Well, she was on Baywatch, right?  I guess so, yeah.  A few years ago?  Yeah.  She's also a Playboy model?  Penthouse.  When was it?  I think Playboy.  One of those, yeah.  Beautiful.  So Mike Piazza, I guess, wants to show the whole world he really isn't gay.  But in this one picture, you can see Piazza's actually watching the morning news on ABC and  he has a big tent in front of his sweatpants.  Nice obscure reference.  He's, yeah, a lot of rumors about Mike Piazza over the years. 
[00:39:30]  That he's a gay.  I remember when he came out and he dyed his highlight at the top of his hair blonde.  Like our own Martini Steve.  Like Martini Steve.  And there were rumors around.  I remember when he came out and he had a, his catcher's mitt had flames on it.  Remember that?  Yeah.  Yeah, sure.  Everyone remembers that.  The coach told him he had a sweet face.  It was wonderful.  And then he comes out and he's got this hot chick now as his, his girlfriend right on 
[00:40:00]  the cover of the paper.  And they're getting married.  So that's the big story for the New York Post today.  Now, they don't want to talk about the inauguration or Iraq or the tsunami.  The big inauguration.  Oh, that's like, eh.  We'll get to that.  Care.  Yeah.  Bombings in Iraq.  25 dead.  Car bombings.  Ah, nah.  Mike Piazza's getting laid.  Well, and then Newsday did it right.  Front page of their paper, the number 20, Death of Queen Soldier Raises City's Sad 
[00:40:30]  Toll in Iraq War.  Now, that's real news.  Right.  This isn't news that Mike Piazza's getting married.  That's like, throw it in the entertainment section, not on the front page of the paper.  Front page.  You know, it's wintery and cold every year, Anthony.  Uh-huh.  I hate to break it to people, but every year it gets down to single digits and people  are stupid and die.  Every year.  Every year is a deadly freeze.  That should be the front page of a newspaper?  I don't think so. 
[00:41:00]  But it is.  Inauguration coming up, like you said.  Something I noticed.  Watching the news and you're seeing all the deep freeze and all the Brad and Jennifer news  and stuff like that.  What happened before the election?  I remember Bush was always on TV and Cheney and everyone else talking about how dangerous  it is.  You remember that?  Remember?  It was just a couple of months ago.  How dangerous and in danger we were and how he's got to be president because terrorist 
[00:41:30]  threats are coming in every day.  We were always going up on alert again and there were rumors and chatter that we were going  to be attacked and they were telling us that we're going to be attacked so please be careful.  What happened?  Now no one really seems to care about terrorism and no one's concerned about it.  There hasn't been an alert.  We haven't been in danger.  Bush isn't on the news every day talking about how much danger we're in. 
[00:42:00]  Did it stop?  Or were there maybe some scare tactics going on?  Oh, they played it perfectly.  During the election.  They played it perfectly for the election.  But does anyone see through this crap?  And no, I'm not a Kerry supporter or wasn't a Kerry supporter.  I'm not a liberal.  I'm not a Democrat.  I'm a Republican.  And I'm fairly conservative Republican, believe it or not.  So don't give me that crap and call me up and say, oh, you liberal ass.  This is just something I think is blatantly obvious that there were claims that he was 
[00:42:30]  using scare tactics to get people to vote for him.  And now all of a sudden the election's over.  I don't hear anything about terrorist threats in this country, about how much, because that  was the thing, how much danger we're in.  At all times, you'd turn around during the campaigning and you would think, you know, one  of them was behind you with a bomb strapped to him.  Now, everything's fine, I guess.  And no one cares anymore.  They definitely played it perfectly.  You know, people in general don't want change during war times.  And they made sure you understood that during the election. 
[00:43:00]  Just everyone petrified that we were, that an attack was imminent.  And now you don't hear anything about it.  Where's Cheney?  Put him on and talking about how much danger we're in.  Where's Rumsfeld?  Oh my God, we're in so much danger.  You better put Bush in there because he's the only one that can handle this imminent  danger we're in.  No more danger.  Kerry was so awful.  Bush was so ready to be beaten.  He was so ready to be beaten.  And that was the best they could do.  That was it.  And it's ridiculous. 
[00:43:30]  The Democrats really need a good candidate because he stunk.  Really did.  And now I guess everything's fine.  Everything's good.  Everything's dandy.  And then something else I noticed really quickly was everyone making all the hoopla about  that huge Airbus airplane.  You know, they got the, they're talking about casino, a casino inside of it.  And they got these big lounge chairs.  Well, the pictures are amazing that were in the picture yesterday.  Really are.  There's like spiral staircases, bars.  Yeah, there's a duty-free shop.  So Ben can't go in? 
[00:44:00]  First, the first class section has its own restaurant and little bar area.  Yeah.  I mean, this is in a plane.  They're calling it the cruise ship of airplanes.  This is going to go in the air.  Yeah.  And then they have like a whole first class business area with laptops and things like  that all set up and ready to go.  Big sleeper seats.  Big huge sleepers.  Big huge beds.  Seats, yeah.  With your own little mirror and stuff and controls and it's just amazing. 
[00:44:30]  But they show like a stewardess walking down a spiral staircase.  This is in a plane.  Yep.  It's double-decker.  It's like the old 747s.  That little walk-down spiral.  Yeah, they got the bubble on the 747, which is like a little lounge area.  Now, the whole top half of this plane is another area.  It's just amazing.  Huge.  550 people in one of its really big first class section.  They're saying this can be configured to hold up to 800 people if it's just configured as  coach in the entire aircraft. 
[00:45:00]  But 550 people in this basic configuration.  I'm just thinking, what about the gate area?  How do you fit 550 people in a gate area?  And then I'm thinking about boarding and getting off of this crate.  Could you imagine?  You know how long it takes to get off of some of these planes if you're in the back and you  got to wait for every jerk-off who stuffed his bag up in that carry-on to take it out?  You know the slow guys and you're looking like, take the bag out of the overhead. 
[00:45:30]  You're killing me here.  And you stand there.  If you're one of the guys that are in steerage and you got to stay in that last seat and  you're the last, absolute last one off the plane, it could be 20 minutes from the time  you pull up to that gate to the time you get off of that plane.  Imagine 550 people.  They'll have two doors.  They'll have two, obviously, two ways to get off.  Hopefully one for the 30 in first class and then one for the other 520.  So now every airport is going to have to have a gate that accommodates these planes and 
[00:46:00]  has two jetways that go up to the plane?  They were saying on the news that the airports aren't equipped for these planes.  Not all of them are.  They're saying it's going to be like late 2006, possibly early 2007 before these planes  could land at JFK.  At JFK.  Because now the runways have to be, I guess, a little bigger or whatever.  The gates have to be configured for these huge planes because there's no way one jetway  is going to accommodate 550 people getting on and off.  What's the biggest ones now?  I know that we have planes that hold like 400, I think, right? 
[00:46:30]  747.  777s now.  I don't know how many they hold.  I think 747s.  They hold more?  Bigger than, yeah, as far as people go.  I think he's still talking 747s fit more people.  But it's still not 550 people.  You know?  It just seems to me like they really have to have things organized for these things to  be really convenient.  You see the gate areas where there's just a swarm of people and it takes forever.  And now imagine even more people shoved into these things.  I don't like a duty-free shop. 
[00:47:00]  Why do you need that?  I mean, I love the idea of like a little gym area.  Yeah.  Yeah, we're saying that too.  Yeah, gym area.  But yeah, a duty-free shop.  You can do that right in the airport.  As soon as you land, you do that.  Yeah, there's some things you just don't need.  Duty-free.  You can do something else with that space, obviously.  I don't think you need to get your nails done either on a plane.  What is that?  I don't know.  Maybe Voss can do it.  After last night, he walked to the comedy cellar with a manicure.  I wanted to cut his hand off.  He did?  And smack his face with it.  He got a manicure?  A manicure.  And I recognize his shiny nails. 
[00:47:30]  He has the biggest disparity between what he actually is and his impression of himself  than any other person I've ever seen in history.  Some people are worse than him, and some people actually think they're better than him.  But the spread there is giant.  He is such a nothing, and he thinks he is such a somebody.  Designer shirts and a little manicure.  Shiny little nails with a clear polish on it.  Flying first class to the Oscars to write for Chris Rock. 
[00:48:00]  He's writing for Chris Rock, and we're making fun of him.  We're going to be throwing that tidbit in our faces for years to come.  It doesn't matter.  Every time he walks by the mirror, it's still dumb Richie from Plainfield.  Well, who did the Oscars that year?  Yeah, we live on Venus now, Voss.  How long ago was that?  He's just going to keep turning that screw.  This just in, everybody.  Who gave us this?  Eric?  Danny?  Danny's working hard for us. 
[00:48:30]  Game delayed by Dog's Doing's.  Orlando, Florida.  It says AP, so it has to be true.  Who didn't let the dog out?  Oh, boy.  That's the headline.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Who didn't let the dog out, Anthony?  A stink was raised during halftime of the Pistons' Magic NBA game on Tuesday night when the start  of the second half was delayed by three minutes after a seeing-eye dog relieved itself on the court.  The dog was with a charity organization, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:49:00]  When the Pistons came out for warm-ups, Rasheed Wallace walked up to the lane where the excrement  had fallen, stopped, and stared in disbelief.  His teammates were just as confused before wide smiles broke out.  A custodian was enlisted to scoop up the mess and wipe up the remains with cleaner, a mop,  and towels.  Wonderful.  Too bad that wasn't there during the Pistons fight.  They would have been throwing at each other and pushing each other's face in it.  That would have been hilarious.  That's great.  That's just then. 
[00:49:30]  That's the...  Breaking news.  Another thing we noticed, we like pointing out the absurd on this show, as you know by  now, and let's see, in the New York Post, there's a picture of Brad Pitt, everyone.  Yes.  And it's Brad Pitt with a t-shirt I now want.  Which one is that?  He's got the Led Zeppelin t-shirt on.  And he's just so cool.  He's got his shades on.  You know, he's got the long-sleeve shirt underneath.  He's got the, you know, the Led Zeppelin t-shirt over it. 
[00:50:00]  All in black, pretty much.  And he's on the beach with his head down, and he's walking Anthony.  Walking just a picture of Brad, right?  Yes.  It's just him.  Of course.  Walking the beach.  And the caption says, a lonely-looking Brad Pitt strolls along the beach in Santa Barbara  Monday after his recent breakup with his wife, Jennifer Anderson.  Oh.  In this picture from People Magazine.  Oh.  Showing him all sad and by himself.  It's too many.  Yeah.  I'm so sure he's lonely.  What they don't show is what's waiting for him back at his crib. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  Back at his suite.  His luxury suite.  Bimbos for everybody.  What must it be like to go through a breakup and know that you can just take it out, and  before you walk one block, there's a mouth on it.  That's it.  What is it like to live that way?  That isn't a real breakup.  No.  These two are...  Forget about it.  And Jennifer Aniston.  Same thing.  You know?  But it is easier for girls.  It doesn't matter what the relationship is.  You could have a slob with you.  The reality is...  You could have a breakup with a girl. 
[00:51:00]  She could be out that night just getting banged.  After I read that thing about that Down Syndrome girl getting raped.  What was that?  Guys just still sticking at anything.  I saw it in one of the papers.  I'll have to find it.  But apparently a Down Syndrome girl was raped by some guy, and the despicable defense attorney  is saying, I really don't think she understands the consequences of her lying.  Like, oh, that's just...  What was she wearing? 
[00:51:30]  I don't know.  I'm sure something cute.  Couldn't have been sexy.  Powderpuff girl.  Powerpuff girl shirt.  That greasy hair and the hockey shirt really got me going, Your Honor.  That Moe Howard haircut.  I called her Elo and jumped on her.  Wow!  What did he do to you?  I love him.  But that's the haircut.  He just didn't comb his hair that day, so it was a little flat in front.  Oh, my God.  We've got to see him in a couple days. 
[00:52:00]  Hey, Lou, what's up?  Hey, I was just curious.  What the hell did you do?  He's curious, Opie.  Okay, Lou.  Lou, start over, Lou.  We weren't really listening to you.  Murray was talking.  Okay, Lou.  Talk about blind people.  All right.  Hey, the seeing-eye dog, would it bring blind people out to the basketball game?  Seeing-eye dog in a basketball game. 
[00:52:30]  Seeing-eye dogs don't belong in basketball games.  Yeah, I don't know why the blind guy was there.  The blind people need basketball, too, you know.  Okay, Chris and the boat, Pookie.  Yeah, you make a good point.  Why was the blind guy at the basketball game?  They can hear it.  Yeah, but you can hear it at home.  But you can hear that at home, I understand.  But you need an announcer, because all you do is hear cheers.  He probably jumps up at the wrong time.  Half the time, there's people like, asshole.  Oh, that's a good point. 
[00:53:00]  What an idiot.  I'm thinking, yeah, no, you can hear the whole game.  There's an announcer.  No, you're right.  All you hear is sneaker squeaks.  Yeah, that's about all you hear.  And cheering.  Great.  So, Brad Pitt, you've got to think this guy is just getting a lot of pussy right now.  Of course.  I think he's secretly relieved.  Girls throwing themselves at this guy.  I mean, he's just, after all, he's just human.  Yeah.  Yeah, he was married to a piece of ass, but he's looking at all that tail around him. 
[00:53:30]  It's not like he's a mechanic on Long Island, and he knows it's not going to get any better  than the slob he's sleeping next to.  You know, this guy is tempted every day.  The breakup where then he's trolling the local bar scene for chicks and striking out.  That's not the world of Brad Pitt.  He breaks up.  That's it.  It's suites full of boos and broads.  They try to portray him as the lonely guy walking down the beach. 
[00:54:00]  He's lonely.  Yeah, I mean, I'm not buying that at all.  I wouldn't worry about him.  And, you know, this guy knows how to play it.  I'm sure he saw the photographers ahead and said, all right, I'll give him a look.  The girls open that newspaper up and just, oh, poor Brad.  I now have a shot with him.  Getting out there, stupid stationary.  Gary, dear Brad Pitt, finding his address online.  Who did his publicist send it to?  I broke up recently, too.  And I think we would have a lot to talk about. 
[00:54:30]  Because they see on Oprah that some one-in-a-million-shot borderline celebrity actually picked up a girl online or something.  And they think they got a shot.  I know you don't know me, but if you ever need someone to talk to.  Yeah, just to talk to.  I understand how hard a breakup is.  Me and my boyfriend worked at a deli in Basapiqua.  John, we broke up recently, and I understand.  No, you don't. 
[00:55:00]  You don't understand what it's like snorting cocaine off a supermodel's bellies.  Take your fat fingers and stick that pencil in your eye.  Awful delusional people.  That's funny.  Let's say hi to John in California.  John, what's up, buddy?  John.  John, what's up, man?  Hey, guys.  Why are you guys so slow on the phone today?  That girl with Down syndrome that got raped.  I wonder if anybody's been in over to Bob Kelly's house to check his basement. 
[00:55:30]  He's just a lock there.  Wow, nice call back.  Oh, yeah.  Guys listening to one of the Bob Kelly stories.  Speaking of Bob Kelly, we got the audio finally in here from the HBO Dwarf special.  Yeah.  Some of that lovely audio from these freaks of nature.  And really fast because it's really cold out.  Baby, it's cold outside.  These are the only two we got today?  Anthony and I were pretty much obsessed with how seriously the news takes cold weather. 
[00:56:00]  Oh, they love it.  And they talk about it like it's something that never, ever happens.  Like I said, it happens every year.  I mean, we've had better examples, but we've got a couple examples.  The local news talking about the deep freeze here in New York City.  Listen to this crap.  It is bitter cold out.  We have been extremely lucky so far, but not anymore.  Old man winter finally making his presence felt. 
[00:56:30]  Old man winter.  That annoys me.  Old man winter took some Viagra today.  Ha ha.  Oops, is this on?  I'm what?  It's felt New Yorkers are wrapping up this morning, taking the cold weather in stride.  Cutting my...  Now, of course, they've got to go to the idiots.  Of course.  On the street to talk about cold weather.  Yeah.  Not to talk about their opinions on Iraq or... 
[00:57:00]  Uh-huh.  No, we're going to talk about the cold weather.  Right.  Cutting my lips.  I can't pronounce words.  It's bitterly cold.  I...  The kind of weather you just want to be in bed for.  Wouldn't we all?  But the reality...  I can't pronounce words.  But that happens at 85 degrees.  So...  I was so cold, I called my wife a can't.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  I don't know why the news has to state the obvious and do these stupid fluff pieces. 
[00:57:30]  They cover it like it's a huge story.  Like it's the first time we've ever seen this.  Cutting my lips.  I can't pronounce words.  Bitterly cold.  I...  The kind of weather you just want to be in bed for.  Really?  We all.  But the reality is...  One point or another, we will have to face old man winter.  So wrap yourself up in a blanket.  This bitter cold snap is bringing frigid temperatures into the area.  Forecasters saying the wind chill today will make it feel like 15 below.  For those who can't escape the cold like the homeless, it will be a tough week. 
[00:58:00]  But for anybody who will face the elements, hyperthermia or frostbite should be on the  mind.  Hyperthermia develops when the body temperature drops at normally low.  Symptoms may include shivering, exhaustion, confusion and fumbling hands, memory loss,  slurred speech, as well as drowsiness.  Infants have bright red cold skin and low energy.  If you have frostbite, your skin turns white or grayish yellow.  It feels firm or waxy and numbness sets in. 
[00:58:30]  In both cases, it's important to get warm as soon as possible and seek immediate medical  attention.  Really?  It's important to just state the obvious.  Right.  Really?  What a load of crap.  No, no, dude.  Shivering is a sign of cold.  I was kind of wondering what that meant when I was walking yesterday.  Tied it right up for me.  Thank you.  I'm shivering?  What does this mean?  And it suggests that you search out medical attention immediately.  Yeah.  Really?  I'm shaking.  I thought I was going to be cast in the Back to the Future movie.  If you see your fingertips turning gray or white. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, my fingertips are turning white.  They're hard.  Yeah.  Oh.  That's really bad.  Unless you're black.  Then you're like, thank you, God.  And then we have another example here.  The Hokie news people talking about cold weather.  It is dangerously frigid out here.  I'm dead.  One in Queens.  The other in Coney Island, Brooklyn. 
[00:59:30]  Possibly because of the frigid temperatures.  Tell me how bad it is tonight.  Make sure you put on your scarf, your gloves, your hat, your mask, anything you can put on.  It is cold.  Do not stand out in it.  Rosalind's not kidding.  Really?  Thank you.  If you don't cover up, you're taking your chances.  This is...  You hear the news report?  This is the best you can do after that stupid speech?  She's not kidding.  Rosalind's not kidding.  Listen to this.  It's cold.  Do not stand out in it.  Rosalind's not kidding.  If you don't cover up, you're taking your chances. 
[01:00:00]  This is very cold.  Bone's really cold.  Shirley Hemble wasn't kidding.  No, no, he was not educated.  Imagine being these construction guys working into the night.  But Frankie's got it covered.  How good is this mask?  I wouldn't be out here without it.  But Artie is hatless and hearty.  I go swim in Super Bowl Sunday.  Artie's cold?  And he is there.  You're in the Polar Bears Club?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  No wonder you could be out in this without a hat.  Oh, my God.  This is practice.  And you don't want to be Tom, a con-ed worker, unless you're his partner, who's 12 feet down under and warmer. 
[01:00:30]  Probably about 30 degrees warmer.  How'd you get stuck up here and he's down below?  Senior man down there.  Blankets for Warmth tonight is teaming up with the Coalition for the Homeless to make sure that nobody is left out in the cold without anything.  Free cups of soup given out.  Would you like a blanket?  Oh, yes.  And 46-year-old Theo among those getting free woolen blankets.  It's like going to the bank and cashing a $1,000 check. 
[01:01:00]  That's important, this blanket issue.  Very important.  Theo is very thankful to be warm at this hour.  We're live in Chelsea.  Koran Mihalik, UPN 9 News.  What an awful segment.  That is the most awful story.  Theo's father is a doctor.  His mother is a lawyer.  How did that happen to him?  What a faggity name for a homeless guy.  That blanket is like cashing a $1,000 check at the bank.  No, it's not.  You take $10, you buy a blanket.  You have what? 
[01:01:30]  $990 left over, you dope.  No wonder you're homeless.  You couldn't figure that out.  Your expenses.  He could have had a place to stay for a while, but he spent a grand on a blanket.  What was that story?  It's very confusing, Koran.  And he might want to look into money management.  Jesus.  And you can't cash a check unless you have ID, and no one's going to write smelly animal  on a license.  And by the way, one of the people that died, there's two people that died.  Yeah. 
[01:02:00]  One of them was a homeless guy, which happens, but one of them they said was a nanny who  froze to death on the boardwalk in Brooklyn.  That's one of the two people that died.  She was at Coney Island.  What are you doing?  Why are you at the Coney Island boardwalk?  Because if it's four degrees out, it's minus three at the boardwalk.  Minimum, man.  With it coming off the water like that?  Yeah.  What the hell is she doing there?  How does she care for children?  If she doesn't know to get her own fat ass up off the bench when she's freezing to death,  how do you freeze to death?  And not, unless you're incapacitated, how do you not just walk away and go somewhere 
[01:02:30]  warm?  Go somewhere warm.  Exactly.  I was walking home yesterday.  Before noon, I had a bad day yesterday.  I was a naughty boy.  I spent a little bit of cash where I shouldn't have.  Oh, boy.  And then went and had two cheeseburgers and a big, large fry on my fat face.  You had two cheeseburgers?  Yeah, McDonald's.  At the same time?  That's the worst.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was like, you with the bananas yesterday, like, joking around, but I was really shoving  them on my fat face.  And I had to walk two blocks from 8th Avenue back to my apartment.  And I got a moment where I'm like, I do understand how people just pass out in the  cold.  It was that, it was like I had a hood on and it was hitting my face and head. 
[01:03:00]  And I'm like, if there was nowhere to go, I would be in a lot of trouble right now.  It was brutal.  I just need a space suit.  Like, wouldn't it be great to just put on a real space suit like they walked on the  moon with and just go to work there?  A nice 80 degrees or something.  You know, the reality is they still haven't come up with good winter wear.  No.  Because it's always, you still feel cold.  You're right.  I probably have the best.  It should be something you could just slip right into and not feel it at all.  Right.  You shouldn't feel it. 
[01:03:30]  It should be like mylar thin, yet completely insulating from any cold.  Breathing apparatus.  It's 2005.  Right.  And we're still doing the same thing that pioneers did.  Yeah.  Throw layers on.  Where's the electric stuff?  And, you know, the real stuff that works.  Not the crap they sell at Sharper Image or something.  I put on this huge parka every day with that ridiculous big puffy hood.  The thing zips up to my eyes and a scarf.  And, actually, for the walk from the garage, it's not that bad. 
[01:04:00]  But I look ridiculous.  I look like, you know, one of the homeless guys walking around, head down, just kind of  trudging your shoulders up.  For some reason, that's supposed to keep you warmer.  Everything all tight.  All tight.  Clinching all the muscles.  Yeah, you pull muscles in your arms just because you're so tense walking.  It's ridiculous.  We really have to broadcast from somewhere warmer.  Yeah, definitely.  That's why we're going to balmy D.C., I guess.  I don't think we're going to make it to D.C., by the way. 
[01:04:30]  It's supposed to be snow.  Like crazy snow Sunday.  A blizzard?  Are they saying blizzard yet?  Crazy snow Sunday.  That's what they're saying.  Mad snow, Opie?  Yeah, it's going to be awful.  Will that stop a train, though?  Will that stop our train?  I don't know.  That'll suck.  Why don't we take a break and play the audio of Mia from Celebrity Fit Club?  Oh, let's focus.  We'll talk about American Idol.  That show.  A bunch of delusional freaks.  That show was kind of entertaining.  American Idol is fun to watch the first few. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah.  Because you get all the dopes and idiots that think there's somebody.  Uh-huh.  And then after that, it's a bore fest.  It really is.  No, I kind of get, you know what it is?  It was interesting the first season.  You kind of find people with a little bit of talent and stuff.  And, you know, it's kind of interesting to watch.  I can understand how the show does well.  But, yeah, the beginning rounds are the most entertaining because, again, we love a freak show in this country.  And this is more of a mental freak show than a physical freak show.  Just to watch people that are completely delusional actually think they have talent, can't hear themselves, 
[01:05:30]  and then to watch their hopes and dreams just torn from them and them leaving in tears, it's fantastic to watch.  Can I tell you one thing not to just say, but that's Simon, man.  I wouldn't want to be on his bad side because, boy, that guy will say anything.  Yeah.  He's deadly.  That act's getting a little thin.  Yeah, he's a joke now because, all right, we understand you're going to hate everybody.  We get it now.  You know what I mean?  No, but he picks a lot of strong targets to attack. 
[01:06:00]  That's why I respect him.  Some 17-year-old from Duluth who's never going to be anything.  That's who you should go after.  That's what we like on television.  You're a fat whore.  Oh, thank you.  Right.  Thank you, Simon.  You have no talent at all.  Oh, thanks, Hope Streams.  Let me just slip my wrist and jump off a bridge.  Yeah, he's corny, man.  He really annoys me.  Really irritates me because his targets are always weak.  I just don't like anybody that attacks people who are trying to make it in show business.  I know it stinks, but it's easy.  It's easy.  I don't know. 
[01:06:30]  When you get people up there, I understand people that are actually trying and have some kind of talent,  but when you get these freaks up there that just are horrid and think that they have it,  I love when people just give it to them straight and go,  look, don't bother.  You really have no talent whatsoever.  But I think it hurts more of the other members of that panel to tell them they stink.  Yeah, yeah.  Because they're expecting it from Simon at this point.  So it's like, oh, yeah, whatever.  You were paid to trash me. 
[01:07:00]  So they're not believing as much as if Paula Abdul or the Sugar Ray dude, Mark McGrath.  What's Mark McGrath doing?  I haven't watched it.  Well, they've got this new thing.  I guess they've got a celebrity judge in there.  A celebrity judge every week or something like that.  Spice it up.  He was kind of taking charge, wasn't he?  Yeah, he was pretty good.  Yeah.  And then the black guy that doesn't really do much on that show.  I don't know why he's even there.  Who, dog?  What's his name?  I don't even know his name.  Randy Johnson.  Oh, Randy.  Yeah, he doesn't do much of anything.  He just kind of sits there.  Was Mark McGrath, like when I saw him at Dyson's party a few years ago, 
[01:07:30]  was he trying to get a Hummer from some six in another room?  From a six?  Yeah.  Yeah, I kind of respected that.  He was really drunk.  Why would he do that?  Why not just step outside?  Any chick could throw themselves at the guy.  Yeah, I remember.  He was a little drunk.  And I was talking to her after.  She's like, yeah, he took it out.  He wanted me to do it.  Wow.  I kind of respected that.  Oh, really?  And then she looked down, and you had taken it out also.  Something about you, honey.  Oh, wow.  It would be the head and the oxygen flowing in and out of it. 
[01:08:00]  Dude, we found the Mary Roach clip.  Get out, really?  The whole thing?  Bravo to Steve.  All right, good.  We got to take a break.  We got lots to do, and we'll continue.  The pride of the Serengeti, Opie and Anthony.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez.  It's an Opie and Anthony Wow Sticker Stop.

[01:10:00]  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  What do you want?  What were we even talking about?  That break was so long.  Everything just slipped my mind.  That could be the shortest break ever. 
[01:10:30]  It's a little weird.  And people are bitching about us going on a break.  Look, man, we got to, like, we have to go to the bathroom.  We got to throw some food in our gullets.  Now we're going to eat on the air.  Yeah, and then they bitch if we eat on the air.  We can't win with our audience.  We just can't win.  What's this?  Opie and Anthony, RadioDailyNews.com, 2004 Newsmakers of the Year.  What?  I have no idea.  It just came in the mail.  Win an award?  Let's see.  Dear Opie, congratulations.  You have been recognized by RadioDailyNews.com as a Newsmaker of the Year for 2004. 
[01:11:00]  Ten individuals and organizations were honored this year.  A news release detail in the recognition is attached.  Each of the recipients of the award is being presented with a certificate of recognition.  Look at this cheap thing.  Yeah.  And yours is enclosed.  If the certificate was damaged during delivery, contact RDN, and we'll provide you with a replacement.  Again, congratulations.  Keep in touch with media news and information at RDN's website, RadioDailyNews.com, and keep up your good work.  Very best wishes. 
[01:11:30]  This is Larry Shannon, the publisher.  Let me see.  Well, yeah, look at this certificate.  It came in the mail.  It's not damaged at all.  Larry, you better pot up a replacement.  Who else was recognized?  Unveils RadioDailyNews.com, unveils its list of the top ten newsmakers of 2004, Anthony, listed in alphabetical order. 
[01:12:00]  Air America, the FCC Commissioners, Al Franken, Ubiquity Digital Corporation, Tom Joyner, Rush Limbaugh, Opie and Anthony, Sirius Satellite Radio, Howard Stern, and XM Satellite Radio.  And then the next five people we beat out, Lee Abrams from XM Satellite Radio.  Really?  Clear Channel and the Mays family.  Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly, and Ryan Seacrest did not make the top ten. 
[01:12:30]  We beat out those guys.  Wow.  What the hell is this?  I have no idea.  It just came in the mail.  Is it important, you think?  I don't know.  It doesn't look like it is.  No.  It really doesn't look like it's important, and now I need a new certificate if it is.  Let me see.  Is Ryan Seacrest, by the way, is he still hosting, or did he walk away from American Idol?  I think he's still doing it, right?  I think he was on last night, so.  All right, what do you guys want to do?  Thanks for addressing it to Opie and Anthony. 
[01:13:00]  The letter.  Dear Opie, congratulations.  You've been recognized.  Who's that, Larry Shannon?  Go fuck yourself, Larry Shannon.  How about that, Larry Shannon publisher?  Yeah, you're really on top of the news.  That's good.  That you just address it to me.  It's all about me.  Opie and Anthony.  I think this stupid certificate said Opie and Anthony did it.  I don't know.  I don't know.  If you want to get it out of the garden, you can check.  The letter just says, Dear Opie, congratulations.  There's a guy that's on top of the news. 
[01:13:30]  I put in ten years so Larry Shannon can blow me off.  Good one.  Thanks, Larry.  You dickwad.  Radio Daily News.  Is there a co-publisher?  Maybe I'll just talk to him.  Maybe I'll just identify that guy.  Well, maybe he has a separate letter.  Jack douche.  Ass F.  That really bugs me.  Even the certificate said Opie and then it had a line and it said insert name here. 
[01:14:00]  Insert name of partner here if you choose.  That's wonderful.  All right.  Well, there you have it, Anthony.  That's tool.  That's just in.  Okay.  You guys want to do the Celebrity Fit Club real fast?  Let's get into this first and then we can do the American Idol.  All righty.  Because I don't want to talk about fat people while Ralphie May is here.  Don't.  Kidding.  He doesn't care.  No.  Well, we were supposed to get to this yesterday, right? 
[01:14:30]  He doesn't know he's fat.  Shh.  Ralphie May will be in studio in about 15 minutes, 20 minutes.  All right.  The man that saved the show.  I got to agree.  All right, Anthony.  So Mia Tyler is on the Celebrity Fit Club.  Yeah.  And it looks like, in my opinion, she's a spoiled brat.  Steven Tyler's daughter along with Liv Tyler.  Liv Tyler came out so nice looking and just nice in general.  You see her interview.  She's all sweet.  Yeah, you watch the old Aerosmith videos with her and Alicia Silverstone. 
[01:15:00]  And Mia is just, just, just hot.  A bruiser.  Well, she's a bruiser.  She looks like Monica Lewinsky.  Yeah.  And she just has this attitude.  Yeah, she acts like she's hot.  She shouldn't.  She should act like she's fat and be a little humble.  Well, she's a plus-sized model, Anthony.  Oh, stop it.  And, you know, they're sexy, too, according to the plus-size models that walk the runway. 
[01:15:30]  They tell each other how sexy they still are.  There are girls, here's the classification, because she's delusional.  There are girls that are overweight that can be sexy to people that are into that.  You know, there are people that, there are guys that just like skinny girls that will never find even a slightly overweight girl sexy.  You're not talking about those little niches.  You're not talking about chubby chasers.  Just basically what the majority of people like.  If a girl's chubby, that's fine. 
[01:16:00]  She can be very sexy.  If a girl's even a little overweight, some people will find her sexy.  It's all about how you present yourself, too.  You know, some of these girls are a little bigger.  They just carry themselves nice.  Yeah.  They wash their hair.  I'm saying that because Mia looks just awful on this show.  You know, she has a big, you know, trucker tattoo on her right arm.  Huge shoulders.  Yeah, she's just awful.  And then there's people that are morbidly obese, hugely overweight. 
[01:16:30]  Who don't take care of themselves and then claim that beauty is in the eye of the beholder and it's what's inside that counts and all that.  They're not sexy.  You can't say it doesn't matter that they're 800 pounds, like she says.  That's not sexy.  People, no one's going to find that sexy unless you're a freak that enjoys that kind of thing.  And in that case, it's not that you're sexy.  It's that you're attracting freaks that enjoy some kind of fetish, some niche.  So she's delusional. 
[01:17:00]  This might be cruel, but I don't even think the law should protect you when you're that fat.  I think that people at random should be able to throw things and hurt you in the street and the police should just go look at yourself.  Look at you.  You're a mess.  We'd love to help you, but...  Speaking of which, I mean, Jim Norton's getting his second CD together.  And we found the picture that's going to be the cover of his CD, man.  Oh, really?  Oh, my God.  It's this...  You want to explain it?  It's like a stick figure, but it's done really well. 
[01:17:30]  A stick figure of a fat chick.  And then there's three guys off to the side, all stick figures, pointing and laughing really hard.  And the fat chick is in a little, like, party dress and stuff, but she's really fat.  And she has tears, right?  She's crying.  And then what's going to be the title?  The title is Fat Pigs Deserve to Cry.  And I got to say...  I like it.  Dude, you got to see the picture, though.  There's something about the picture that just makes this beyond funny. 
[01:18:00]  I ran a silly contest to see who would do the CD cover.  Like, you just had some fans do it and whatever, artwork.  And that one came in, and I showed up, and I was laughing.  And I'm in the shower, and I'm like, well, obviously, I could never use that.  And I'm in the shower, and I'm soaping up, and I'm just laughing.  And I'm like, that's the cover of the CD.  Yeah, it's got to be.  Fat Pigs Deserve to Cry.  I want one of those T-shirts when they come out.  That's the greatest.  Because this drawing is just hilarious.  It's absolutely hilarious.  I got to see that.  Yeah, it's a classic.  So here's audio of Mia on Celebrity Fit Club.  This is the clip where she's fighting with the trainer. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, the trainer is some, like, military guy, you know, very serious, and trying to  whip him into shape boot camp style.  And she's not having any of it, you know.  She thinks she's above that, I guess.  I kind of forgot my sneakers, so should I just take them off?  Because I might hurt myself.  How do you forget sneakers?  You call it a fit camp.  Um, I had some other things on my mind.  What's more important than you bringing sneakers? 
[01:19:00]  Well, you were all glistening in the pool before.  What did I have to do to press the T train?  No, I'm just kidding.  I actually forgot my sneakers.  So what do you want me to do?  S*** off.  Well, you don't help at all, so I'm not going to ask you anything.  He decided to be a surgeon a*****, which he's so good at being.  No, he's being logical.  Yep.  You know, part of the show is you do some exercises with this fitness instructor, and she shows  up in flip-flops.  Yeah.  Because she had other things on her mind, like eating, probably.  She's going there to do this show about, you know, losing weight and working out. 
[01:19:30]  I think you remember your sneakers.  He actually has a very important question, though, because she said something.  He's like, what's that got to do with the cost of tea in China?  When I want to hit you with that, you know, it's going to be a tough road.  A surgeon a*****, which he's so good at being, and decided to yell at me instead of trying  to teach me the right way of doing things.  You really?  Teach me the right way of doing things?  Rule number one, show up to do exercises with sneakers.  No one should have to teach you that. 
[01:20:00]  Sorry, Ovi, I got a big mouthful of bagels.  Here's the right way to do things.  What he should be really helping with is, like, all right, no, no, you open your mouth.  That's right, you put it right around there.  Now, the trigger, you put your toe at the end of the trigger, and you go, flip.  There you go, fatso.  Flip.  Me the right way of doing things.  You really amaze me, Mia.  I'm trying to ask you a question.  You hear the burn fat, but you got more fat excuses coming out of the mouth than I've ever seen. 
[01:20:30]  I will pop you in the mouth if you talk to me like that.  I came over here to ask you a question.  Which one you going to swing with?  I don't care.  I'll hit you with both of them.  Good.  Go ahead.  Take your best shot.  I came over here to ask you a question.  Take your best shot.  No, I came over here to ask you a question.  What do I got to do with it?  Come on.  You supposed to have your trash packed.  Let's go, Mia.  Okay.  You know you coming to dog on fit care.  You coming out of dog on running shoes.  And I'm asking you a question.  You obviously don't care about someone's health because I'm asking you.  What that guy doing?  You don't care about what the hell he's going to be bringing for dog on fit care.  What you want me to do?  I'm not doing.  I'm not doing some goddamn sneakers.  I'm not arguing that.  I'm asking you.  Well, I did. 
[01:21:00]  Start your warm up.  That's what I was asking you.  Well, warm up.  I'm going to get knocked out.  Take your best shot.  You want me to?  I'm not afraid to hit you.  I won't hit a woman anyway.  It's not necessary.  Stop.  It ain't worth it.  Stop talking shit.  Let's go.  Man, she is just a spoiled brat.  She came right back at him like she was going to punch him.  Yeah.  Ooh.  I want your D-O-R mayonnaise.  Oh, no, wait.  That's what's in the corner of your mouth. 
[01:21:30]  D-O-R.  Yeah, what a spoiled brat.  You can just tell, right?  I'll bet you at one point in the series towards the end, though, when she loses some weight,  I'll bet there's a tear-filled hug where she'll hug him.  Of course.  And he'll tell her, you done good, missy.  You done good.  Thank you so much for your help.  I know that there were times when...  Shut up.  It was tough love.  And Daddy would be out singing, and I'd be putting cake in my fat mouth. 
[01:22:00]  Where's Daddy?  Where's Daddy?  Oh.  Oh.  He didn't even know it was his daughter until she was 15, and he mentions her at all the awards.  She takes bites like Fred Flintstone out of that big pterodactyl leg on his dinner table.  Oh.  Oh.  So here's the last clip.  Mia.  Now I guess you go in front of the judges. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, that was outside.  And they comment about your progress.  Yeah.  The doctor gets his turn, and then you get the...  The therapist.  The therapist, thank you.  And then the trainer that she has a big problem with.  And they stand on the scale and see how much weight they lost.  And this is where she...  Oh, wow.  Just listen to this.  Mia.  Last week, you weighed 210 pounds.  We set a weight loss target for you of four pounds.  Tonight, you weigh 205 pounds. 
[01:23:00]  Five pounds at once.  See, that's one more then.  That's a good start.  Yeah.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Marissa.  You get lots of work as a plus-size model.  I do.  You look beautiful.  Your husband adores you.  I have to ask you this.  Why are you here?  What's your motivation?  I'm not here to get thin.  I don't ever want to be thin.  It's not about being thin.  Sure.  Sure you don't.  Really?  She's one of those girls.  Anybody overweight...  She's going to try to sell that to...  Ugh.  Anybody that's overweight that says they don't want to be thin is lying. 
[01:23:30]  Of course they are.  They're lying.  And again, I'm not talking about people that are a little chubby.  I'm talking about people that are, like, grossly overweight.  They...  To say you don't want to be thin is a lie.  It's an absolute lie.  And then they say that society is wrong.  It's society's views that are wrong.  Really?  You don't want to be looked at like a freak.  Yeah, of course.  Look at plane seats.  You don't want to be huffing and puffing, walking up one flight of stairs. 
[01:24:00]  Of course you want to be thin.  You're lying.  It's an addiction.  Food's an addiction.  I'm an addict.  You think I want to be a sex addict?  No, I don't.  It annoys me that I've destroyed all shots of intimacy by paying for it.  Whatever.  You know what you are.  But don't lie and say that society's wrong.  You're the one who's wrong.  Your overindulgence has put you here.  So?  Mm-hmm.  Let's listen.  It gets better.  I don't want to be thin.  It's not about being thin.  It's about being healthy.  So I'm trying to as much be here for myself as be here for the rest of the world who's watching this show. 
[01:24:30]  Oh, inspiration.  Yes.  Your husband likes you the way you are.  Yes.  Here we go.  Do you think he's going to like you once you lose the weight?  Yes.  As much as he does while you're fat?  Yes.  Really?  Wait, would you call me fat?  Fat.  So you're telling me that girls my size aren't sexy.  Why?  Okay.  What?  She's not sexy.  And he didn't say that.  Do yourself a favor and watch this show on VH1.  She is not sexy. 
[01:25:00]  No.  She's like a linebacker with those big shoulders.  Maybe.  I mean, I heard she's gained like 30 or 40 pounds since she got married or something like that.  Yeah.  Maybe 30 pounds ago.  Maybe she was a little overweight and looking sexy.  Maybe.  I don't know.  But she definitely doesn't look sexy as she was standing in front of those judges.  How is it sexy when you've got that big gut hanging over your pants?  I don't see it.  I don't see that on a girl as being a sexy thing.  Hey, you know, dude, check out that girl's gut hanging over the pants.  Isn't that hot? 
[01:25:30]  No.  People will say no.  Again, you'll get the freak or two that'll go, yeah, that's great.  I want to go.  But for the most part, you can't say, dude, look at those big, fat, saggy breasts.  Hanging over her gut.  Look at that cellulite ass.  Look at those back tits.  Isn't that hot?  Isn't that sexy?  No.  People will say no.  Because it's not.  My size aren't sexy.  No, I'm not saying. 
[01:26:00]  I'm saying I think you'll like you a whole lot more.  I think you have issues.  I think you've got more issues with your body size and being fit.  And you care too much.  I think that's not good for your head.  I think you need to lighten up and be a little easier on yourself.  Me being this size doesn't make me any less sexy.  I could be 800 pounds and I'd still be sexy.  You believe that you could be 800 pounds and be sexy?  It's in your head.  It's not about your size.  You're smoking crack.  You're not standing there and telling me you weigh 800 pounds.  You're going to be sexy.  I'm saying people like you in the world who say people aren't sexy like me, being my size, that's what causes people to be bulimic and anorexic and want to go get their noses done and their lips all plumped up. 
[01:26:30]  There's nothing wrong with being yourself.  You said I condone that.  That's how it seems.  No, no.  You tried to say last week, you tried to tell me last week that it seemed like it was okay for me to starve myself.  I guarantee you gained 800 pounds, you would not look sexy.  I guarantee there's a million people in this world that would say otherwise and I could give a f*** what you say.  You're going to get weight loss for the next two weeks to be 8 pounds. 
[01:27:00]  That's fine.  She's delusional.  There probably are a million people in this world that would think an 800 pound woman is sexy.  A million people in the whole world.  That's it.  Go ahead.  Go find them.  P.T. Barnum is half of them.  There's no way you'd find a million people.  In the whole world.  No way.  There's billions of people on this globe.  I don't care.  I'm telling you, no way.  800 pounds is sexy?  No, it's disgusting.  Because you'd find a freak.  I'm talking freaks.  That's a freak fetish thing. 
[01:27:30]  There are guys that think an 800 pound mess laying on a bed is sexy.  The chubby chasers, right?  That's beyond chubby chaser.  A chubby chaser can go into a bar and look at the girl that no one else is really looking at because she's kind of fat.  And go, yeah, I find that sexy.  That's a chubby chaser.  That 800 pounds, that's just a freak show.  That's the same thing as wanting to have sex with a corpse or a dog.  It's something beyond anything normal. 
[01:28:00]  And drill sergeant's incompetent, too, because he, first of all, it's like you called her out.  Don't, you don't think girls my size are sexy?  She's like, I'm not saying that.  You should have said, no, I don't.  It's not.  I don't.  Why aren't you on the cover of Sports Illustrated?  Because no one would buy it, fatso.  If it would sell product, people would buy it.  Right.  If seeing you in a bikini would sell more than three copies.  People want to see a girl her size with her feet in the mud and a tiger eating her back.  While gulls circle and laugh at her. 
[01:28:30]  Well, that's what happens in nature.  We're trying to make believe we're not, you know, animals here.  We are animals.  What happens to the outer-shaped fat gazelle?  Hump.  Exactly.  They sink their teeth into the neck.  But we got these idiots.  It's okay to be chubby and fat.  That's what she was saying.  She goes, that's your problem.  They now put it on the people that aren't fat.  They look and say, no, well, it's your problem because you have this perception that fat people aren't sexy. 
[01:29:00]  No, it's, no.  You can't have a woman that's 800 pounds and say that she's sexy.  It ain't going to happen.  I'll say 210.  Very rare.  Occasionally, there can be a quality in somebody.  Because sexiness, it's all in your head.  Part of it's in your head.  Not all of it.  All right?  I'm sorry.  I don't care.  You're a birth victim.  You're not sexy.  I've seen some women pushing 200 that are definitely, you would say, well, sexy.  Not something that I would go for.  And what do you say in your head?  You go, man, if she dropped some weight, she'd be really hot.  Or if I was drunk. 
[01:29:30]  You know what I mean?  I'd let her, you know, whatever.  But there are women out there that are a little bigger that could carry themselves with their weight is what I'm saying.  But with this Mia girl, she's just a mess.  She's not carrying any weight nicely at only 205.  She's carrying weight.  It's like all up in upper body weight.  She's got those big shoulders and, like, big gut.  Yeah.  And when they say it's what's inside of the counts, I mean, you know, you're kidding yourself.  The reality is when you're dating, you look at someone that you're physically attracted to. 
[01:30:00]  That's what nature's all about.  Yep.  And then you hope they back it up with some kind of personality.  Right.  That's how it goes.  You look at the plumage first.  Exactly.  Yeah.  You see a hot piece of ass and you're like, wow, I'd like to get to know her.  And then if she's a zero, you F her a few times and kick her out the door.  But, you know, you hope maybe there's something inside there that you could get attracted to as well.  But you're not looking at a fat girl going, well, she's a disgusting mess, but maybe she has a good personality. 
[01:30:30]  I'm going to go check that out.  That never happens.  Never.  Dress your schlong up like a Nathan's.  There you go, honey.  Take it away, fatty.  I'm in not good shape, bad shape.  I'm overweight by a few pounds.  I'm like 160.  That's the problem.  I'm not really overweight.  I'm just a mess.  But I'm not deluded enough to think that I should wear a tight tank top and walk on.  And I'm not putting myself in that category.  But you have to have some self-awareness.  I know that the fact that I'm a lazy little lump is what has contributed to me being a mush. 
[01:31:00]  That's why I wear baggy long shirts to try to hide it until they've already committed to banging me.  And they're like, all right, well, whatever.  There's tits hanging over me, but he's here.  I'm not deluded enough into thinking it's sexy.  I think you should wear a half shirt and show me how you've painted your car.  Can I kiss you on the mouth?  That's exactly, exactly.  Hello, exactly.  Can I kiss you on the mouth?  Can I kiss you on the mouth?  Hello, exactly.  Do you want to kiss me or? 
[01:31:30]  Put in belly shirt.  I'm a fucking idiot.  Idiot.  That's great.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  And then Nina Hartley's in there having fun, and I walk out like William Macy while my attractive chick is in there.  There is an awful shot of you in a half shirt.  Where was that from?  We took it in here, right?  Oh, in here, yeah.  Oh, here it is, right here. 
[01:32:00]  Is this up on openanthony.com?  It shouldn't be.  That is great.  Small penis, big war.  It's a picture of Bush and Norton.  Someone brought a shirt.  And Norton's wearing it.  It's a half shirt that is made for someone that's probably, I don't know, a lot smaller than you.  Let's just put it that way.  I mean, this shirt is so tight on you.  It's like a baby tee.  Yeah, and it's a half shirt with Norton's gut just sticking out.  It's horrific.  You knew it was horrific.  I'm an atrocity.  And that's why you let us take the picture, of course. 
[01:32:30]  But I'm under no illusions that it's anybody.  And again, I know people who are like, you know, 250 in a call and go, this idiot, what are you talking?  And I know I'm not putting myself in that category.  I'm just saying self-awareness.  I know that I can't be walking around shirtless and looking good.  It's going to be messy.  Right.  And it's my fault that it's messy.  It's not society.  Some hot chick who takes care of herself shouldn't want to lay under me for free.  That's society's hang-up.  It's me and Tyler.  It's nature.  Yeah.  We're all animals.  As much as we're trying to make believe we're not, that we're above all that. 
[01:33:00]  Same little stupid instincts and little mating rituals.  All right.  We should do a little break here.  And a 210-pound woman is not that bad.  I mean, when you compare it to what people do get up to, which is 450, you can really get large.  But just her attitude just makes me want to smack her in the face.  Yeah.  All right.  You know, we've got to take a little break here.  Why don't we do a mash-up?  I like this one.  It's Eminem and Paul McCartney getting together.  Ooh.  How about a mash-up called Mealy Apple Sailed at Nathan's Head? 
[01:33:30]  Oh, no.  Is it Mealy?  Nathaniel.  I called him Nathan.  I can't even trash him now.  I fucked up his name.  Aw.  Is it really Mealy?  Let me see.  You can tell without biting it.  You can feel it.  It feels not bad.  Oh, no.  That's Mealy.  You can feel it, right?  Oh, yeah.  Now, feel this one.  Wait.  That might be just a bruise, though.  No, this half isn't as Mealy, though.  Like biting into a Stretch Armstrong doll.  It's like biting into a Robert Reed.  I don't want to eat your apple, Eric.  You don't want it?  Thanks.  Go ahead.  Feel the Mealy one.  All right, Anthony.  Let's rock out with Paul McCartney and Eminem getting together for this little mash-up. 
[01:34:00]  I'm eating.  And we've got Ralphie Mae coming in.  And we've got American Idol audio with my favorite.  I'm glad I stayed up last night to see the end.  This Mary Roach chick.  Holy S.  What an attractive last name to have, also.  Mary Roach.  It goes through life with the last name Roach.  Sorry for you people with the last name of Roach out there.  What about our agent?  Eatman.  Eatman.  It's spelled Eatman. 
[01:34:30]  Eatman.  It should be Sleepman, because that's what you want to do when you talk to him.  Let's hope this one turns out pretty darn good, huh?  Guess who's back?  Back again.  Shady's back.  Tell a friend.  Guess who's back?  Back again.  Shady's back.  Tell a friend.  I've created a monster.  If nobody wants to see more, so no more they want Shady.  I'm shocked.  Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give you. 
[01:35:00]  A little bit of weed, missus, I'm hard.  Like I've got some vodka that'll jumpstart.  My heart's looking at the shock.  When I get shocked at the hospital by the doctor, when I'm not cooperating.  When I'm rocking, it's evil while he's operating.  You waited as long to stop debating, because I'm back.  I'm on the brag and ovulating.  I know that you got a job, Miss Cheney, but your husband's heart problem's complicating.  So the FCC won't let me be, he'll let me be me.  So let me see.  They try to shut me down on MTV, but it feels so empty without me.  So come on and dip.  Bow on your lips.  Talk back.  Come on your lips.  Come on your tits.  And get ready, because this shit's about to get heavy. 
[01:35:30]  I just settled on my law, so fuck you, Debbie.  And this looks like a job for me.  So everybody, just follow me.  Because we need a little controversy.  Because it feels so empty without me.  I said, this looks like a job for me.  So everybody, just follow me.  Because we need a little controversy.  Because it feels so empty without me.  Little hell, yeah.  Kids feeling rebellious, embarrassed.  Their parents still listen to Elvis.  They start feeling like prisoners helpless.  So someone comes along on a mission and yells,  A visionary.  Vision is scary.  Because thought of revolution.  Ballooning and waves are rebels. 
[01:36:00]  So just let me revel and bask in the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass.  And it's a disaster.  Such a catastrophe.  But you can see some game.  What's up my ass?  You ask for me?  Well, I'm back.  Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  Fix it, then I turn it, tune it, and then I'm in a inner inner inner.  Funny your skin like a splitter.  The center of attention.  Back for the winner.  I'm in a resting.  The best thing's infesting.  Infesting.  In your kids' ears and nesting.  Keep testing.  Attention, please.  Feel attention.  Soon as someone mentions me.  Here's my ten cents.  My two cents is free.  A new sentence.  You sent.  You sent for me?  Now this looks like a job for me.  So everybody, just follow me. 
[01:36:30]  Because we need a little controversy.  Because it feels so empty without me.  I said, this looks like your sound for me, so everybody, just follow me.  If we need a little bit of controversy, you're gonna feel so anxious about me.  If love doesn't come in a minute, sometimes it doesn't come at all, I only know that when I'm in it, it isn't silly, love isn't silly, love isn't silly at all, baby. 
[01:37:00]  I said, this looks like my sound for me, so everybody, just follow me.  If we need a little bit of controversy, you're gonna feel so anxious without me.  I said this looks like my sound for me, so everybody, just follow me.  If we need a little bit of controversy, you're gonna feel so anxious without me.

You can get a wow sticker  by going to  opieandentony.com  There's an address  where you can send 
[01:40:30]  a self-addressed  stamped envelope.  It doesn't mean  they want to sleep with you  just because they wow you  it means they're having fun  because I'm a pervert  and I would misinterpret  that means she wants  to get laid  but sometimes  they're just being silly.  We've never had a problem  with this.  Never.  That's why it continues  because everyone knows  it's just kind of  if you're part of this show  and you're a faithful listener  you know what it's about  and it's just all about  just a little fun  on the roads  and that's it.  Simple as that.  Ralphie May has  entered the building  he's going through security  I don't know why  but he is  and filling out paperwork  and all that crap 
[01:41:00]  that  What about the paperwork  you filled out last time?  I don't know.  Isn't that  or maybe  maybe it's just warming up  I don't know.  And then Playboy  just came out  with the chick  from Meet the Fockers.  You don't like her?  I took a look at it.  In the first movie  I thought she was just  hot as shit man.  How old abroad is she?  She's not that old  I know what happens  she's one of these  women  I think she got divorced  had a kid  Oh stop  and this is her way  of just showing her  No women that have kids 
[01:41:30]  in Playboy  period.  Why?  Don't do it.  Rachel Hunter  we went through this.  Yeah we went through it.  She arched her back  her head was touching  her ass in half the pictures  because they got to  arch their backs  to make things look good.  Are you saying  to stretch everything out?  Right.  Stretch it back  into place or whatever?  Exactly.  Well hello  exactly.  I just want to look  if I look at Playboy  I want to open it up  I want to read the bio  I want to see  birthday

It is  really creepy  when you start  realizing  some of these girls  I hit  15?  16?  That's exactly  what I want to see.  I'm saying  but it should have been  a little bit later.  Yeah.  What do you want  to put old broads  in there?  Why not put  orthopedic shoes  on her hand? 
[01:42:30]  No you know  I don't want to see  and there was a picture  of her  her nether region  in there  you know  down under  and it just looked  kind of looked  like a baby  came out.  You don't want  to see that.  She has very nice nips.  Sorry.  Yeah she's  she got nips  of a woman  that's breastfed.  Dude I like that  big long ones.  She's cute man.  She's a real girl.

Girls  what are you  doing with that one?  Watch your right  love and hate  on your knuckles  dummy.  You know  I'm sure  there was a first  girl that did  that somewhere  but man  there are  how many girls  are gonna go around  with that goddamn  tattoo over their butt?  The ones that don't  put it on the butt  women don't know  how nice that is  naturally  leave it alone.  Leave the ass alone. 
[01:43:30]  You know what  if she was the only  girl in the whole  magazine  oh dude  I'd thumb through that  oh my god  it would have been  nice and I'm like  yeah she's kinda  cute and stuff  whatever  you see the centerfold  oh I know  this Italian broad  with olive oil  just pouring it  all over her  huge natural boobs  look at the girls  of fear factor  also are in that  they're natural  she was born in 81  from Dallas, Texas  everything's bigger  in Dallas, Texas  she ready to retire  born in 81 
[01:44:00]  oof  Amber Kemp  joined AARP  Kempisi  that old fossil  how do you date that  and how secure  are you as a male  where you could  go out with her  and there's actually  a guy at one point  that turned her down  somewhere  some guy  who right now  is probably  in a men's room  meeting someone  through a glory hole  oh the fear factor  ones  look at the last page  look at the last page  on the fear factor girls  it might be the girl  I was telling you about  look at this 
[01:44:30]  that's her  this is the girl  I told you about  when Joe Rogan  was on the phone  with us  this short girl  with these huge  natural boobs  did Joe say  if he had sex  with her  I'm sure he's  trying to have  sex with all  these girls  Joe's listening  to us right now  so Joe  why don't you  call in  and tell us  how many of the girls  in the Playboy issue  you actually slept with  which one  this is radio  we can't do this  no flip back one  are we here  yeah  let me see her  standing up  which one  no  that picture 
[01:45:00]  a lovely girl  see that's not bad  that's better than  the one that's on the cover  from the Fockers  she's got the same  kind of look  you know  that blonde thing going  dude you're too picky  I'm not too picky  it's Playboy  for God's sake  I was being picky  yesterday as a goof  with that girl  from the Sports Illustrated  you know  reality show  she's not walking over  saying I want to sleep  with you  I'm being picky  no go away  I'm saying it's Playboy  I was listening  to the replay  that was really hilarious  that this girl's  trying to defend her  stubby tiny little toe 
[01:45:30]  oh the  she's a hot  you know  almost supermodel  and we're  just talking about  her tiny little  stubby  yeah we're  we're  no  me  no we didn't  notice or tell  oh  I thought you guys  were in on that one  I was being cordial  it was just me  we were just  uncomfortably squirming  I was being nice to her  alright well  and by the way  I guess speaking of Rogan  you want to talk about  depressing  do a tough crowd with him  and then have people  looking at his layout  he did a magazine layout  like in like boxers  or something  because he's a martial artist  washboard 
[01:46:00]  it was  I was miserable  looking at another comic  in that kind of shape  I really wanted to  kill myself  how is it that  Carrot Top is buff  and you're  you're doughy  no Carrot Top is an animal  oh dude  we saw him in the lobby  of the MGM  when we were in Vegas  that guy just works out  every day  I got a picture with him  with the tough crowd  we were  in the dressing room  and he's got like  an open shirt  and you can see his pecs  it's miserable  Carrot Top is really  in good shape  dude he's an animal 
[01:46:30]  he just is a  gym rat  he probably  at one point in his life  just said  you know  with my  the way I am  and with my act  I better know  how to kick some ass  because people  are just going to want  to punch me in the face  you know  the reality is  he's a really  really nice guy  and he's a funny guy  when he did it  people were like  well how is he going to be  without the props  he was actually very funny  just you know  because he got goofs on himself  he doesn't care  big Carlin fan  yeah  he's a funny dude  alright why don't we  play some of this  American Idol  audio 
[01:47:00]  before we get  Ralphie Mae in here  the show  my fourth season  I guess  I mean I'll watch  the next few days  and then I'm done  with the show  simple as that  I'm one of those  that watch the whole thing  I like looking at  the train wrecks  I like the freak shows  yeah  and this is all  freak show stuff  in the beginning  the auditions  the auditions  a lot of people  that are very delusional  and then you got Simon  that oh wow  he's going to trash everyone  I get it now  he's insulting people  the first season  when you didn't know  what he was about 
[01:47:30]  you're like oh wow  look at this guy  the guy's brutal  yeah blatantly honest  but now it's getting old  fast  of course he's going to  not like any of them  yeah  when he starts  trashing rappers  I'll have respect for him  when he can sit in a room  with two young kids  from a ghetto  you know who are  probably packing  when you can say that  you stink  you know to some kid  from Newark or Compton  then I'll have some  respect for you  but as long as you're  just picking your  easy targets  you're a fucking  one trick bore  we get it  mean Simon  get out of his way  this stupid  quaff faggoty haircut 
[01:48:00]  you said Simon  I was scared  that you were  talking about me  there for a second  no  no  because you're  you're weird  you'll say it to somebody  just it doesn't matter  who they are  I don't go for  just easy targets  no I know you don't  it'll make people  uncomfortable  you'll say it  all right  okay so here's the first clip  I was looking up at the TV  are men smarter than women  they're wasting their time  talking about that today  okay so  I don't even know  okay this is  some chicks singing  the Star Spangled Banner  yeah that was a biggie 
[01:48:30]  a lot of people singing  the Star Spangled Banner  God Bless America  and patriotic songs  and just  just an abortion  God damn it 
[01:49:00]  are you fucking with me  she's not even close  to being on cake  isn't that horrid  that isn't even 
[01:49:30]  bursting the air  gave through  to the night  gave through  to the night  that our flag was  there  and they're just staring  at her in disbelief  oh  oh  just like Whitney Houston  at the Super Bowl  makes me want to move 
[01:50:00]  to Phuket  what did she call  way  she just said way  yeah  wait wait  where was she supposed to  let us know  oh  Jose does that  Star Spangled Banner  yet way  yet way  how bad was that  she thought  she was good  why don't we have  they give so much emotion  like they see 
[01:50:30]  what people do  on television  what entertainers do  and how they're  supposed to move  and look all dramatic  or like move  their mouth  all weird  when they do  that blah blah blah  thing  and their lips  are moving  like Liza  or something  and they do all that  why don't we have  the judges comments  after that  they would have  had some great  things to say there  yep  Steve  go check with Steve  see if we got  judges  Steve  go get that  cozy sissy  here's the next one  we got  sweet face  staring into the monitor  we have a guy  singing  you raise me up  you raise me up 
[01:51:00]  so I can stand  on a mountain  you raise me up  to stand on stormy rain  I am strong  oh  we need the judges  comments here though  yeah it kind of 
[01:51:30]  ends right there  and I want to hear  you know  that was awful  that could be  the worst singing  I've ever heard  it's become  sticky though  I think people  who are bad  go on purpose  because they know  they want to get on  yeah yeah  I've seen those  but some of these  people know  they look so sincere  they so think  they're stars  and then there is  a group of people  that are trying to  become the next  quote William Hung  William Hung  they see that  it worked out for him  did he know he was  awful by the way  or was he really  I think no  no that's why 
[01:52:00]  it worked so well  he really truly  thought he was  really good  and that's where  it worked  you know who  the first guy was  though who didn't  have a publicist  like William Hung  has I guess  remember the guy  from the first one  Lankham Vance  remember that guy  he was like the  worst ever  but he wasn't able  to capitalize on that  wasn't able to  parlay that into  a little career  what was the whole  look of William Hung  and all that  he looked just  innocent and stupid  and he didn't  really know that  he was bad  she bang  she bang  that barbed wire  he has the whole 
[01:52:30]  world goofing on him  and he still has  no idea  but now he doesn't  care because he's  making a good  living out of it  well he's retarded  and you can never  tell with the Asians  because the hairdo  is the same  for every one of them  not to knock the Asians  we have a lot of  Asian listeners  I understand  there were two  in Portland  here's an awful  fat chick  where's the  judge's comments  that was from  the beginning  of the show  there was none  it just shows  a shot  there was no  judge's comments  like a montage  at the beginning  right after she  finished they're  just sitting there  like in utter shock  and then it cuts  to something else 
[01:53:00]  I'll tell you  the kid had an  answer  do we have any  judge's comments  on here  on that first disc  no that's just  the singing  Steve why don't  you go stand  by some poor  homeless people  and warm them up  just warm them up  with that hat  look at that thing  that's the one  we got on them  when we went  to Cleveland  yeah this is  the Cleveland hat  that's a good one  it's got flames  and it says rock  on it  yeah  fantastic  I'd like to find  a generic one  but so far  no luck  what's a generic  one with no word  yeah I don't like  I don't like the wording  but apparently  they don't make them  let's find it  we could find 
[01:53:30]  somebody to make  you a flame hat  that has no writing  on it  thank you  America  America  God shed his grace  on me  and crowned  the good  with brotherhood  from sea  to shining sea  oh  what the hell 
[01:54:00]  is she thinking  I'm flabbergasted  that these people  don't hear themselves  do they hear  people that can sing  do they actually  listen to the radio  they have to  because they all  seem to be  into music  what if it's just  a set up though  what do you mean  what if it's just  a set up  where you know  the producers  of the show  are just going  out there  and you know  finding these  really really awful  singers  for our entertainment  value  but you can tell  because you know why 
[01:54:30]  because they're not  that good at acting  you would have to be  a great actor  to then leave that  room  and burst into tears  and sincerely say  oh my god  they don't know  what they're talking  about  I'm great  I deserve to be  on this show  and they told me  I've been singing  my whole life  blah blah blah  truth is  do they hear  themselves  at all  you listen to the radio  you listen to people's  professionals sing  and you go  wow that person  has talent  and then 
[01:55:00]  you get on  does the sound  go from their mouths  into their ear  where they then hear  wow that's really awful  I guess not  and they're too dumb  to be faking  some of them  you're right  because if they were  faking they'd be  so over the top  bad  they would understand  the ironic part  about being a little  bit awful  but I'm great  why  why are you  denying me  Rachel  alright well  now we got  the fat chick crying  I'm crying  because you know 
[01:55:30]  what  they  not one of them  not one of them  not one of them  said I could sing  not one of them  said I could sing  that's terrific  I can sing  I wouldn't have made it  this far  I wouldn't come here  I'm not like  the stupid idiots  who come here  and want to sing  no you are  I'm one of the 
[01:56:00]  good people  that they cut  no  they have to cut  some good people  no  they searched you out  to make fun of you  on national TV  you dummy  I'm not like  one of those idiots  that come and can't sing  you don't think  there's producers  out there  that are just  their whole job  is to find  the worst singers  and then parade them  in front of the judges  they're not going to get  the mediocre people  that are  well they could sing  a little bit  but they're not that good  that's boring TV  they got producers  that their whole job  is to just  go all over America  finding the worst singers  possible 
[01:56:30]  and then drag these losers  in front of the judges  that's what they do  that's why we sit home  and watch this crap  and you were it  she was wearing some black  it looked like a cocktail  dress or something  she gets up there  and just disheveled  she looks awful  they were commenting on  how banged up  and scarred up  her arms were  she was a mess  I feel bad  I know  it's weird  but I always  I feel bad  because again  they're skewering people  I love  I don't mind it  I love it  but they're nobodies  and again  you want to skewer somebody 
[01:57:00]  skewer Paris Hilton  or skewer Anna Nicole Smith  or skewer somebody  that's making you money  I just hate the way  they go after these  these nobodies  who feel good  about the one thing  they can do  and she's not a good singer  and she annoys people  at parties  unless you're completely  insane  you know what you're getting into  I understand that  you know that there's a risk  that these guys  are going to just rip you apart  understandable  it just bothers me  on another level  I just hate the cowardice  and the fact that they won't  go after people  that are truly celebrities  that deserve  none of their celebrity 
[01:57:30]  well  that's what this show  is all about though  you drag these people up there  they're delusional  and then you crack  their little dreams  and hopes  right in front of  a huge audience  like sit  Paris Hilton down  and for real  do an interview  and say  you're a pig  who has sex on camera  you're a spoiled twat  why are you a celebrity  ask it for real  that's just  it bugs me  it's always annoyed me  when they don't go after  people like that  they go after these  nobodies  it's easy  well you did a great job  going after Al Franken 
[01:58:00]  I like Al Franken  I like Al Franken  I'm open about  liking Al Franken  we're a little different  than yours though  exactly  I'm fine with that  here's a black guy  that sings Tony Braxton  I thought some mean stuff  this guy's awful  this guy actually said  he was cousins  with Tony Braxton  because his last name  is Braxton  and he  like flaming  and he thought  he really really  thought he was good  and thought he was  going to go  you know 
[01:58:30]  all the way  he wasn't  by the way  you know who's cousin  he is  he's actually  Joe Braxton's cousin  that's Pryor's character  in Bustin' Loose  wow  oh my god  obscure reference  of the day  bravo  how couldn't I  break my heart  why didn't she  catch my falling star  I wish I didn't  wish so hard  Nat King Cole  and Eddie Vedder  have a kid  I couldn't 
[01:59:00]  have a kid  break my  heart  oh  heart  oh yeah  and Elvis  all my  suffering  they're laughing  at him  dying  is  right  I'm trying  when the judges  laugh  give it up  I'm too hard  when the judges  are laughing  at you  stop singing  and walk 
[01:59:30]  away  and maybe  it will be so  anticlimactic  that they  they'll  they won't air it  right  and you won't be  the huge buffoon  well they  rejected him  and I think  this is what  he had to say  out in the  hallway  yeah  oh miss  Paula  I'm gonna be  doing it  I'm gonna be  singing English  and I'm gonna be  singing Spanish  I'm bilingual  yes  and I don't  know what race  you are  and Simon  I'm gonna be  doing it  I'm gonna be  doing it  and I'm gonna be  doing it  because I'm  representing you  Randy 
[02:00:00]  you don't even  matter  I mean  what have you  done  you haven't  even been  in the industry  what have you  produced a couple  of songs  and Sugar Ray  whatever your name  is  One Hit Wonder  have you ever  sang a note  do you know  what that is  I don't think  you do  but guess what  my album's  gonna be  multi-platinum  not just one  like you  but many of  them  and Paula  not just three  but actually  eight  so anyway  that's gonna  be my future  and you just  wish you could  be as fabulous  as me  I love that  they crushed  this guy  I love that  they crushed  him right there  live  whatever  on television  I love that 
[02:00:30]  they crushed  his dreams  and then he's  got a rag  on people  that are  successful  in the industry  well Paul  Abdul  you gotta  respect this  I don't even  know what race  you are  that's a pretty  funny line  alright I'll  give him that  and Mark  McGrath  One Hit Wonder  that's another  good one  One Hit Wonder  the guy  the guy  has more money  pouring in  he's got  all sorts of  things going on  in his career  but that still  bothers you  believe me  that bothered him  as he's sitting  there going  who cares  it bugged him  a little  because he did  have one song  and he kissed  up to heaven  in the pool  you know  Mean Machine 
[02:01:00]  that one  Mean Machine  exactly  One Hit Wonder  no no no  that was a bunch  of black  transvestites  singing that  in The Longest Yard  Mean Machine  the grand finale  I'm glad I stayed  up till the end  of this thing  they have this  chick  Mary Roach  Mary Roach  another one  who just thinks  she's great  who has  destined  who has a split  personality at the  least  there may be  three or four  people living in  her head  split personality  and a split 
[02:01:30]  in the crotch  of her pants  she had the  biggest camel toe  but no  her body was awful  what'd she look like  she had a real  like dumpy hips  but she turned  sideways and a  completely flat ass  and this camel toe  oh god  if anybody can get  that to Steve  I want to see that  I love camel toe  no you don't want  to see this one  oh yes I do  awful  sometimes camel toe  can be really hot  it can look like  plump and lovely  and young  and there's other  times where it  just looks like  like a split  an awful  like I had four 
[02:02:00]  kids split  that can be  kind of awful  well I didn't  dig it  you could look  and judge for  yourself  but this one  is just delusional  though she thinks  she's great  she's going all  the way  I think this is  her talking about  her vocal style  I think I have  a very unique  vocal style  it's like pop rock  meets Broadway  meets jazz and R&B  a very unique  combination of all  the three  at least that's  how I would  describe it  pop meets R&B  meets Abbott 
[02:02:30]  Costello  meets Frankenstein  horrid  alright and here's  her singing  the first time  I feel the earth  move  fall on my feet  I feel the skies  falling down  I feel my heart  start trembling  down  whenever I was  sure to frown  oh baby  when I see  your sight  mellow as  the months of  me  oh silence  I can't stand  it 
[02:03:00]  when you look  at me  I feel the earth  move  fall on my feet  fall on my feet  I feel the skies  I'm falling down  I feel my heart  fall  I'm falling down  in the form of a safe  she sounds like  Aaron Neville  with a pit bull  eating his balls  I'm falling down  I'm falling down  I'm falling down  I'm falling down  I'm falling down  I know that  my emotions  are something  I can't  turn your eyes  I feel my heart 
[02:03:30]  thank you  oh yeah  hey Traster  I hope that  we have that audio  alright well  let's go to the next track here  somebody going there  would you like me to sing  like myself  I have a ton  of different voices  right  well what were those  you don't want to hear them  you have a lot of voices  huh  in your head  in your head  are they talking all the time  yeah I think so  what are they saying now 
[02:04:00]  they're saying  I didn't know  the judges on American Idol  would actually think  I was terrible  they're also saying  Mark McGrath is a hottie  she sounds like  Kathy Bates from Misery  you hear that  in her voice  she's trying to sound  like the crazy chick  like maybe they'll think  well she'll give us good TV  but I think she was crazy  oh really was she  yeah  no this one was crazy  she was like crazy  I don't think she could 
[02:04:30]  legally sign the waiver  to be on the show crazy  it's too bad  because there was  more of an exchange  between her and the judges  I mean  it was priceless  she started screaming  and crying at him  and stuff  well we got  then they reject her  but there was more  interaction between  her and the judges  and then she's in the hall  and she just loses her mind  listen to this  hold on  we'll hold  pot it up  sorry about that  come on  I'm never going to  pursue my thing  for her again  ever  I'm going to just  go to beauty school 
[02:05:00]  and start with her  because that's what I'm good at  I'm not going to lose  I'm not going to lose  no matter what I do  I'm not going to lose  I'm not going to start crying  I've heard from many  many many different people  that I have an amazing voice  all my friends have told me  that I had an amazing voice  random people I don't know  have told me  that I can really sing  so  all that  would tell me  that they're wrong  but still  the fact that they said that  that doesn't make me want  to pursue any kind of  singing career  not unless I'm going to be  a lead singer in a rock band 
[02:05:30]  what  do you know who told her  she could sing all these years  guys  who were just doing it  to shut her up  she's probably like  she would sing  and they would say  oh you're pretty good  and she'd go really  and they'd go yeah  as their head  their hand was wrapping  into her hair  pushing it down  yeah  no one's going to tell her  that she's a bad singer  maybe she's in the car  skull  she's in the car  and she's singing along  at the radio  and you go  well you got a good voice  just hoping for a little  later  because you know  she wants you to say that  that's why she's doing it  and then the producers 
[02:06:00]  you know  because they have to  exploit her a little more  they're like  oh you really believe  you can sing  well why don't you sing  another one for us  in the hallway here  and she came up with this  I know I gave you  your freedom  but I still feel tired  you said you'd never  hurt me  but you know you lied  you said we weren't right  you insisted we were wrong  why didn't you realize  to know  before you let me on  why would I love  with nothing  where's a wall of water 
[02:06:30]  when you need one  that song should be followed  by a swept away  loatian boy  wow that was really awful  and the faces  you can't really appreciate  just the  Steve what do you got  this is the extended exchange  of Mary Roach getting rejected 
[02:07:00]  you can't just appreciate  the audio of that last song  because the faces  she was making  when she was singing  priceless  here's the extended exchange  it's a little better  how do you think you did  not too shabby  marks out of ten  like out of a one ten scale  how do you think  I think I did  eight  all right Mary  metric  honestly  one of the worst  I've ever heard in my life  the worst 
[02:07:30]  yeah  honestly  are you just saying that  to get on my nerves  or are you totally serious  because  something tells me  that I think you're saying it  to annoy me  but  what made you audition  for this competition  all my friends told me  that I was an awesome singer  what  Mary you can't sing  a note  I mean  not only can you not  sing a note in tune  you have one of the  weirdest voices  I've ever heard in my life  well  weirdness is originality too  well 
[02:08:00]  yes  good point  well you know  at least I'm not going to  walk out of here crying  like some people do  no I don't want you to  Mary  I'm going to walk out here  being like  hey whatever  and she walked out crying  good job on the  extended audio  Mr. Joshua  Mr. Joshua  his stupid hair  oh okay  thank you  alright so there you have him  I really want to see him 
[02:08:30]  have his  ass karate kicked  on a lawn in the rain  hold a lighter  under his big dumb arm  he'd like that too  wouldn't he  just like Mr. Joshua  a little flame on the arm  wincing a little bit  so there's a little taste  of American Idol  oh and it's on  I guess  eight days a week  three nights a week  or something like that  I'm pretty much done  with the show  I might take a peek  tonight and then  that's it for me  but you'll see it  to the end huh  yeah I kind of  you know  you get caught up  in those stupid shows 
[02:09:00]  sometimes  and that one's  they got some  talented people sometimes  that could actually sing  you know  even that  the  faggot  that didn't win  Clay  two years ago  yeah Clay Aiken  you know  it's not  obviously not my style  but the guy's got a voice  you know  it was kind of cool to watch  because the guy was  actually has a really good voice  well it's only fair  Steve just handed me  an example of one of the ones  that did really well last night  oh really  yeah it's only fair to play this  as we go to break  all right  all you have to do

[02:20:30]  You are slow today, Jimmy  I make a Spuds Buckley joke  And he doesn't even see it coming  Thank God  Let's get some energy  Into this damn show, huh?  Oh, there'll be plenty of energy  Jimmy just took some more  Cough medicine  Non-drowsy stuff  It is bizarre  He knows all the medicines 
[02:21:00]  That you need to take  When you get sick  He's like, oh, no  You need Buckleys  What the hell is Buckleys?  What is Buckleys?  It's Canadian  And their motto is  It tastes awful  And it works  Really?  It's all natural  I know all the stuff  You have to take  Without alcohol  Or any type of narcotic in it  Yeah  It is like Vicks  It's like drinking  Liquid Vicks VapoRub  He goes, smell this  It smells like Vicks VapoRub  Yeah, can I smell it?  Sure  This is for the cough  Which is, you know  Fine for rubbing into your chest  Doesn't Theraflu have alcohol in it?  No, no  It's a powder  Oh, boy 
[02:21:30]  He's throwing it over the board  Yeah, it's a  Theraflu is a powder  I won't take any medicine with alcohol  Sticky cough medicine  In between the faders on the board  Unless you buy that night  And you get this from Canada?  No, I buy it  Oh, my God  Isn't that horrendous?  They sell it  Isn't that awful?  And the nighttime stuff  It smells like ammonia  Yeah, it does  Are you sure you're supposed to  Like  Holy ass  It's phenomenal  And that takes care of the cough?  I saw him  Drinking it  I took two teaspoons  The nighttime stuff is good  But again, either nighttime stuff  Has no alcohol 
[02:22:00]  And it's all natural stuff  So join all the happy peppy people  Taking Buckley  Buckley me to Benjamin  He knows it all, though, man  Jimmy's like  I don't know  He's like a pharmacist  You know  I'm very limited on what I can take  The really great stuff I can't take  All the real good stuff like NyQuil  Plain old NyQuil  Is some of the best stuff ever  It's a big kill  Oh, sorry  It gives you that morphine high  Yeah  Great  Red or green?  Green  I like the regular  Don't  Don't be putting any flavors into it 
[02:22:30]  Old school  Old school, man  Do you do the shots or the pills, though?  I do the shots  Yeah, I do the shots  You got to  It's part of the fun  You do the shots  Because you give yourself a little extra  You pass that line a little bit  I'm going to make this teeter on the top there  After a friend of ours  This is for an extra hour of sleep  I didn't know you could become addicted to that  And then one of our friends  Jay Moore  What?  Yeah  Don't say his last comic standing hosting name  It's not appropriate  Oh, man  I'm going to stop now 
[02:23:00]  Yeah, Jay likes his NyQuil  Oh, yeah  You know, I haven't had it since he  I was in his Tahoe  And he told me about that  And I'm like  I'm never, ever, ever going to have NyQuil again  That's a weird thing to get addicted to, though  NyQuil  Who does that?  That is weird  Why do you have an umbrella in your NyQuil?  He was open about his addiction to NyQuil on our old radio show  I mean, he  It was bizarre  That's an odd thing, though, that is over-the-counter 
[02:23:30]  Like, that shouldn't be an over-the-counter drug  It's one of those things  There are plenty of over-the-counter cold medications  That give you much more of a buzz than, I don't know, some pot I've smoked  That's for sure  Really?  Take some NyQuil  Would you like to try the stuff I've got in my pocket?  Really?  Good stuff?  Really?  I got the weed that killed Kennedy  It's great  Like, all of them  It caused some planes  Had to blow up in Dallas  Hit a tree  All those good Kennedys  Cloth medicine or weed?  Weed!  Weed 
[02:24:00]  Weed, weed, weed  We gotta say hi to Ralphie Mae in studio  To bring some energy into the program  Thank God  Yeah, we were sleepy  Yeah?  Yeah, we didn't sleep well last night  It's so cold  Yeah, well  I mean, like, my bones are hurting  It's so cold  It's like, how cold is it?  It's chilly  It's 11 degrees  Ugh  But we're here from all over the country  People are like, will you shut up?  It's like minus 10 here  In Minnesota and Chicago  Minnesota is minus 54 with the wind chill  That's our Siberia  Those people are retarded  What are you doing there? 
[02:24:30]  Move  South Canada  The birds go south  People move to Minnesota  You're not smart enough as a bird  You're retarded  People move to Minnesota in the summer thinking it's a good idea  Oh yeah, right?  Yeah  Because it's so beautiful up there  It's beautiful here  And look at the, you could see for miles  And then winter hits and they're like  Yeah  Uh oh  Yeah  What did I get myself into?  Yeah  The deep freeze  Because I had to live in Buffalo, you know?  A lot of people thought I enjoyed my time in Buffalo  I didn't enjoy my time in Buffalo  Did you work with Airborne Eddie in Buffalo?  Airborne Eddie? 
[02:25:00]  I remember that name  He's a radio guy up there  Yeah, a radio guy up there  Is he?  Yeah  I don't know him, I don't think  It was a comic from like 10 years ago  Airborne Eddie  But it starts snowing in early October  It doesn't let up until like mid-May  And at the end of the day, it's Buffalo  Yeah  Ugh  Yeah  You ever been to Chicago?  No  I spent some time in Chicago last week  It is freezing  It's so cold  Yeah, it's cold  Chicago  I don't know how they were able to  I don't know how they were able to  Build that really big, nice city  In such a cold climate 
[02:25:30]  Yeah, it just amazes me  I mean, all the other places in America  Let's say  You know, Canada doesn't have a choice  They start pretty high up on that map  They don't have a choice  You know, that's why they have  Toronto and Montreal  As far south as humanly possible  But Chicago being in America  You would think a city like that  Could have been in the middle of  Somewhere else that's a lot warmer  Why did they start building there?  Because it was cold  Maybe they started in the summer  They had a little town built up  And it got cold  And they're like  Oh, we really screwed up  But look, I don't want to start over 
[02:26:00]  They're overachievers  You know, is what they are  Because all the other cities in that area  Like a Buffalo, Rochester  They never got to the status of a Chicago  No, no  Well, after Miss O'Leary's cow  Did all that damage  And burned the whole city  They probably rebuilt and said  You know what?  Let's make it better than it ever would have been  By golly  Let's show everyone  We'll show them  That's what happens  If me is going to knock over a lamp  We're going to rebuild  Speaking of Mia  Our friend here, Ralphie May  Is on that show  Celebrity Fit Club  Yeah  With Mia Tyler 
[02:26:30]  Yeah  Everybody's trashing her, man  I love her  Really?  I was there  I loved it  You know  That show  With as much drama  As Brother Baldwin brought to it  And as much drama  As, you know  There was like undertones  And stuff going on over there  It was so much more relaxing  Than the last comic standing  Really?  So much more  And the tension of being on a diet  You know  And exercising more than you ever have  And your whole body's hurting  Was a lot more pleasant experience 
[02:27:00]  Than last comic  Than last comic  Well, what was the problem  With last comic standing?  Jay Moore  No, no  Jay was a highlight  Jay was  Jay and Rich Voss  Were the only reasons I showed up  Wow  When those are the two strongest points  Of any piece of your life  Yeah  It's really frightening  When Voss  When Voss is considered  One of the highlights  You might have to  Re-exit  What was the problem, man?  Well, he got into a fight 
[02:27:30]  With Jay in the first day  Well, no  We've heard all that  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  And  They wouldn't let me out  After my  My dad died  Twelve hours before the first show  And I told him  I didn't want to do it anymore  I don't want to do this show  And they said  You have to do it  And I go  I don't want to  And they were like  Well, you have to  You sign a contract  And I go  Well, fine  Then next week  Vote me off  I don't want to do this no more  And they were like  No  You can't  And when the ratings came back  I mean, when the numbers came back 
[02:28:00]  The next day  NBC Legal said  That they would sue me  And breach a contract  If I didn't return  Nice  There you go  Nice, right?  There you go  You know, I saw that too  And that was one of the  Craziest moments on TV  I've seen in years  I was watching it at home  I actually called you  Right after the show  Because I was like  You're like  Dude, is that real?  I'm like  Well, I knew it was real  I could tell  But I was just like  Wow, I got to talk to this guy  Because all of a sudden  Ralphie comes out  To do his little  His set, right?  And everyone's  In a happy, jovial mood  It's last comic standing  Here's Ralphie Mae 
[02:28:30]  Very funny guy  And here he comes, you know?  And all of a sudden  He's got tears in his eyes  I was thinking  You were setting up  Some crazy  Maybe Andy Kaufman type bit  That would have been strong  But I'm not that good  No, but  I've got to be honest with you  I'm not that good  I just set up a joke, man  I'm thinking  Where is he going with this?  Like, this is a comedy show  And there's Ralphie in tears  And then all of a sudden  He just announces  That his dad just died  Oh, dude  Like 12 hours before the taping  And then you went on  To tell two or three  Really funny jokes  That your dad liked  Yeah, those are my  And he pulled it together 
[02:29:00]  Yeah  Wow  Yeah  How the hell did you do that?  I don't know, man  I don't know  It was  That was  That was worse than when  I did the Tonight Show  And I had viral meningitis  And I had like a fever of 105  And I don't remember anything of it  But  You do the Tonight Show  And you don't remember it  I don't remember it  Without videotape  I never would remember anything  From that whole day  Wow  I was out of it  But  You were throwing up or no?  I was trying not to  That's the only thing  That kept me from  I mean, I was just concentrating  Everybody's like 
[02:29:30]  You're the most relaxed comic  We've ever seen on the show  And I'm like  Really?  I don't even remember  You were great  I mean, people were like  We met you last time  You were here  I was just over there  But that was the hardest thing  I've ever had to do  That was the hardest thing  And Jay was like  You know  Jay was a good guy  He was fighting for me  To get out of there  But  You really wanted out of the show  And they wouldn't let you  Yeah  I really wanted out of the show  That's amazing  And so that's why  Doing last time  I mean  A Celebrity Fit Club  Was a dream  It was so easy  So easy  Yeah  We're talking about Mia 
[02:30:00]  And you say she's  You know  She's cool as hell  And stuff  She is cool as hell  I don't know if it's editing  Or something  But she comes off  As a real bitch  I know  Like a spoiled brat  I know  Spoiled  You know  It's just awful  We understand that  They edit these shows  You know  In a way  They want to present you  But I don't know  You know  Could you find an 800 pound girl sexy  No  No  But you know  Hey man  If you're drunk enough  You know  You'll bang a fold 
[02:30:30]  You know  Just for the story  That doesn't mean they're sexy though  Well I mean  They gotta have some type of sexiness  About them  To keep an erection  I mean  Especially when you're loaded  I mean  You gotta  Not necessarily though man  I've gotten a rod  One time a dog stepped on my little thing  And I got a  My little thing  My dick  And I was on Viagra  And I got a rod  Yeah so you don't necessarily  Have to be sexy  A dog stepped on  No I'm not even kidding  I'm being funny  Yeah it was  Playing with one of Bob's dumb dogs  And it was stepping on my mule  And I was like  Oh wow  And I had to put it down  And it wasn't that I'm in a dog  I'm not trying to be wacky 
[02:31:00]  But it just happened  Because I had a Viagra  That's just weird  Who's dog  Bob Kelly's dog  Was just stepping on my  Yeah but it was like  That dog's probably trained  To give erections  Bob Kelly's dog  Sicko  Sicko  Licked the taint  Licked the taint  It licked the helmet  And then sat up  Like it was expecting a treat  I didn't cut you off  I was just saying  That you don't have to be  Necessarily  Oh really  Yeah go ahead  Yeah well  You know  If they'd ask me 
[02:31:30]  Because I was 800 pounds  I was a sexy bitch  I don't give a damn  You know  I don't care  I'll tell you the truth  Well Anthony  Brought this show  To our attention  We can't get enough of it  I know  I love why  I gotta say this about it  I gotta be honest with you man  I just  I don't even know  Half that shit  That was going on  I forgot that you can  You can cuss here  Okay  Free him  Anyway  You know  I didn't know  Half that shit  Was going on  Because I just show up  Yeah I'd fly in  You know  Yeah because you guys 
[02:32:00]  You guys don't even hang out  In a house or something  You just  You guys are just showing up  To tape this thing  Do a little exercise  Get your therapy  And weigh in  So you have to do  The weight loss stuff  And the exercising  At home  Also on your own time  Wherever you can  I worked out  I worked out too much  I was  I doubled  What they recommended me to do  And I was doing weight training  And stuff  And so at first  I lose a lot of weight  And then I start to plateau  And then I actually gain weight  But they do a body mass index of me  And I lost  On this show 
[02:32:30]  68 pounds  And I gained  34 pounds of muscle  And so  I lost  68 pounds of fat  34 pounds of muscle  Oh right  They didn't account for that  Huh  Well they do  They show you  They do a body mass index  And he tells you  But as far as weight goes  And getting up on that huge scale  Yeah  On that  Sometimes you look like  You're a mutt  And I didn't know that  I didn't realize  What was going on  Until they did a test  Like a body mass index  Of what makes you up  So we know that you 
[02:33:00]  Lost 68 pounds  Yeah  Thanks for wrecking the show for us  Oh I'm sorry baby  I don't really care  I'm just kidding  No no  It's good  It's a good show  We think Mia's a bitch  We think Wendy  The Snapple Lady  Is just out of her mind  Oh no  She's a sweetheart  She's hysterical  I'm going to bring her in here  I'm going to get her in here  You know  Coming up with excuses  That she overate her whole life  Because at two  She wasn't the center of attention anymore  Because her parents  So  Twins  God forbid  Decide to have more kids  Yeah  That's a little wacky 
[02:33:30]  Yeah when she's laying down  With a hypnotist  And she's crying  And it was you know  It's so hard to watch shows like that  And go  Oh yeah  You know  I really feel for it  Because you're a jaded radio guy  And I watch it  Like millions of women  Across the country  Were like  Oh I'm the same way  Yeah  I'm the same way  That's the reason I'm that  Great Wendy's giving everyone  An excuse to overeat  You know  Because I have a clip of me  Actually watching the show  Yeah  It gets me going 
[02:34:00]  If that was a legitimate reason  For overeating  Could you imagine  How many fatties  There would be out there  On the streets  A lot  It would almost be  The largest population  Of fat people in the world  In the world  Hmm  Hmm  Interesting  Did she  When's the last time  She was in a Snapple commercial  How many years has that been  It's gotta be ten years  No no  She's doing them again  They dumped her  But I mean the original ones  They dumped her  They dumped the original campaign  When Snapple was bought out  By the Quaker Oats people  Yeah 
[02:34:30]  Why did they like it  They just wanted something new man  I think it was the 80s though  I think it was like late 80s  She was doing those  Late 80s to early 90s  Yeah  Like 94, 95  Something like that  And then they dumped the campaign  And then they  Now they got her back  For voiceover  And stuff like that  And magazine  What the hell was she doing  Working at Snapple  Before they brought her back though  She  Executive assistant at Snapple  Same job she had  When she was doing the commercial  Oh alright  So she never left the company  She just wasn't the  Oh okay  Oh she was actually an employee  Of Snapple  And they just made her

[02:38:30]  You really don't see a lot  Over the top homosexuals  So it's just kind of nice  To have that novelty  As he flirts with the straight guys  Through the whole show  Alright we get it  I know  We get it  You know what cracks me up  Is that  The first time he did that  Activate the scales  Thing at the end of the show  It was like  Activate the scales  It was like  Hey Paul in  Jesus  Yeah  You want to try that one again  Put it up a little  Was it gay?  Could you tell I was gay?  No a feather boa  Fell out of your mouth  Okay  No you're not gay  You always have a little 
[02:39:00]  Paul Lentol  Yeah he does  Yeah yeah yeah  Absolutely  But at the end of the show  When they throw you guys  On those giant scales  Yeah  Dude if I would have known  About that  I might have thought  Second thoughts  Alright thank you  Thank you for saying  Because I was going to  Call you out on that  I'm like  No that is like  That is just  It's like just  Let's pile the meat  On the scales  And see which side  Is lighter  That's it  And then you have  Ant going  The scales don't lie  The scales don't lie  Oh  So melodramatic  You know  But the whole show overall 
[02:39:30]  I'd do it again  Yeah  I'd do the show right now  I enjoyed  What I got from it  You know  I'd show up high  And I'd work out  And that's the only way  I'd work out  I'll tell you the truth  I'm not going to work out  Unless I'm high  Because it hurts  Work out high  It hurts  You know  I've physically been  In a lot of pain  For the last four and a half months  Working out  I mean  You know how they say  People say  It'll stop  You won't be as sore  If you work out every day  That's all bullshit  Yeah  It fucking hurts 
[02:40:00]  I mean  It hurts really bad  Okay  And I've been looking  At the Food Network  Like it's porn  I swear to God  I'm watching  There was a bitch on there  Cooking a big ass cake  And I'm like  I'm going to fuck that cake  That cake  Ain't no calories  In fucking the cake  Let me tell you  And I'm like  I'll pull a three-way  With a cheesecake  If it's looking at me weird  You dirty little cheesecake  You want this too  You're still working out  Yeah  Yeah  I worked out yesterday  With a trainer  At the gym across the street  At the Parker Meridian  So there's a gym 
[02:40:30]  Right beside it  I took a train  I did a  I walked on the treadmill  I did about three miles  On the treadmill  And then  And then I spent an hour training  Doing arms, back  And legs  How much you weigh these days?  I don't know  There's not like a lot of scales  To like measure me  But  Well you had your stomach  I keep on losing weight  You had your stomach stapled right?  Yeah  I had the gastric bypass thing  Wow  Last November  I've lost around 200 pounds  I mean that was at the end of the show  I lost over 200 pounds  And so  I just keep on losing weight  You know  I don't know 
[02:41:00]  My pants get bigger  When I started Celebrity Fit Club  I was wearing a 68  68 or 70  70  Where do you get 70  The fat guy store  They call it a big and tall  But it's a fat guy store  Yeah  I've never seen no tall dudes in that  Never go  Never once  I go  Wow  Who do you play for?  Okay  No  It's always a bunch of fatties  Big and tall  Yeah that's just to make it cool I guess  Yeah  So they call it big and tall  Oh yeah  Instead of biggums  He's not fat 
[02:41:30]  He's not the fat guy store  Yeah the fat guy store  Biggums  I think fat guy store's got a certain genesis of quality  You got a 70  Yeah 70  And now we're 58  Wow  Wow  Moving down  I was  Yeah  I was down  When we got fired  I was down to a 30  Which was ridiculous  That's way too small for me  But I just didn't feel like eating after you lose your career  Teenage boy pants  But y'all did lose your career  You got paid  You were paid by those people  Well yeah  I mean it worked out 
[02:42:00]  In the long run  We didn't know what the hell was going to happen to us  We didn't know if we were going to get fired  Every day we thought we were going to get fired  And we were going to be blackballed  And we would never do this again  Yeah  So it kind of  Plays on your mind a little bit  It's radio  You go get a new name  And go do another show  We did have some interest  But we didn't really know for sure  How this was going to pan out  And you know to be honest with you  Yeah it's the best thing that ever happened to us  We'll go on TV  And tell everyone how morally it was wrong  And wah wah wah  But the reality is  It made us bigger in the end  Man that was the greatest move  And America's way too uptight 
[02:42:30]  And I love that  You gained like three stripes in my book  Okay you know  Yeah people get a little crazy about that  You know  Well I think there should be more of that  I mean come on  Let's start  Let's do it again  People don't like shaking anything up  Don't we have the Sex Olympics again  Uh probably not  I don't think  But the important thing is that  At one point Opie was a 30  And I mean that little V he has  Coming off his stomach  I mean  You're dirty  Norton you make me feel gross

[02:52:00]  Oh, yeah  It's a cruise ship now  The thing is  It looked like Snuffleupagus  Hanging off  It's disgusting  Wonderful  It looked like half a hot dog  That you cooked in the microwave  So it's all frayed and exploded  At the end  That's when you cook it  It should have  You know what it should have been?  It should have been like  Sitting under a hat  In a Fat Albert cartoon  It looks really good, man  He loves that  Love it  I just didn't like the piercing  I don't like piercing  No, Norton loves the big clitties  Really?  Oh, my

I like that  Big bulging  Yeah, it stinks a little  I like that  You like a little stink on it?  Yes  You're a filthy animal, aren't you?  No, it's sexy  I just love it  We've got to say hi to Tom in New Orleans  We were just talking to Ralphie May off mic  That we're going to Mardi Gras  Yeah  I should have known you  Super Bowl weekend  I think we fly  We'll be down there for the Super Bowl  Well, that's what we'll be doing on our own  And then we'll be broadcasting  On the 7th  The Monday and Tuesday  After the Super Bowl  And Tom from New Orleans  Is helping us out 
[02:53:00]  With the broadcast location  Tom, what's going on today?  How you guys doing?  How are you, Tom?  Hey there, Tom  How you doing?  It was afternoon  I could crack open a beer  A beer  As a big stink  My man  A couple of bouncers  At one of the clubs  A couple of weeks ago  During Sugar Bowl  Two of these huge guys  They must have been about  6'3", 400 pounds  Yeah  They ended up killing a black man  Oh, I do declare  So they're making all the bouncers  On Brethren Street  Take sensitivity classes 
[02:53:30]  This is a true story  Why did they kill the black guy?  12 minutes  Was he lippy?  What happened?  Or was he looking at white women?  They claimed he wasn't properly dressed  In the dress code  I just didn't think  That's a good reason  To lose your life  Jesus  Well, you're saying that in sarcasm  But you know what?  Dress codes are making me fall  No, I'm being honest  It killed him  It's been all over the news  And the club's in a bunch of shit  I don't know if you guys remember Razu  Oh, yeah, I do remember that  Razu?  Razu  Wait, what happened? 
[02:54:00]  He got really drunk  And he thought that Jack Lemmon  Was going through his file cabinet  And his friends started throwing a fit  And they said he was acting unruly  So basically these two guys  That looked like baby gorillas  They were white dudes  And they just  They brought him to the ground  Out front on Bourbon Street  And they were sitting on him  And he ended up dying  Like asphyxiation or something  Whatever  Jeez  What an awful way to be suffocated  On filthy Bourbon Street  Yeah, with two fat guys  Oh, with two big bouncer asses on you 
[02:54:30]  Real quick to touch on that story  That you guys were talking about yesterday  I called it on the replay  About the blowjob girl  Yeah, yeah, yeah  We were very close to getting  Thrown out of Mardi Gras  Because the people at the other club  That we were broadcasting from  They were monitoring the entire broadcast  From a secured location  Somewhere off premise  And every time you guys would say  Stripper and not entertainer  They'd call me  Remember how many calls I was getting?  Oh, I was supposed to say entertainer  You are not letting someone  Give a blowjob on the balcony  And I came out to shut it down 
[02:55:00]  And open it up  And it looked like kids at Christmas  After the Grinch stole all their toys  Tom, what do you mean?  So then I just kind of said  No, we're not doing it  We're shutting it down right now  But of course you know  We don't  Tom's trying to sound like  He was the responsible one  At Mardi Gras  Yeah  Which did not happen  Actually, you know what happened  I remember now  Yes, we were broadcasting  From a strip club  And they didn't like that  That we were saying strip  And strippers and all that  It was a nice club, by the way  It was  And I remember  On Bourbon?  Yeah, on Bourbon Street 
[02:55:30]  I remember we had the blowjob  I think she's called the blowjob queen  Or something like that up  And she was going to give one of our listeners  Some oral treats right there on Bourbon Street  In front of thousands of just lunatics  And we started  Tom ran out  Because now this all makes sense  He didn't tell me this side of the story  Tom runs out because the owner's losing his mind  Yeah  And looks at us and goes  He's saying this  You boys can't do this  Or something like that  You boys can't do this  But the whole time as he's saying that  He's nodding his head like  Just go with this with me  Yeah  You guys can't do this  Make it sound like it's not happening on the radio 
[02:56:00]  So that's when we said  Tom, what are you doing?  Wrecking our radio show  Or whatever we said  And then  I forgot  And then she continued doing what she  What happened?  She was a little skanky, man  A little?  On the front of her shirt  And on the back  She had written  Slut and whore  Like in Magic Mark  And by the way  You weren't responsible  When he passed out  His liver actually wrote  Help me  In a stomach  Like the exorcist  All right, boys  We're ready to party, man  Yeah, you're setting up  This year's broadcast 
[02:56:30]  And we can't be  More excited to see you again there, Tom  Hey, what's his name  With the Elvis sunglasses  Isn't going to try to lick  Jimmy's bald head again, is he?  No, he's not  He's not even in town anymore  Where is he?  I heard he went to  In the middle of Louisiana  Like Alexandria  Some real small station  Okay, I was wrong  He's done well  But he's around  All right  But that's going to be a party  Remember, guys  Get you anything you need  Anything  We know that, Tom  Tom's the man 
[02:57:00]  Yeah, Tom's the man  Anything you need  All right  We have Ralph P. May  I've got a lot of clients  To entertain  Some strip clubs  To go to today  About a four-hour  Pile of lunch, you know  All right, cool  You know how good  Strip club you can take us to  Where things get done?  Yeah  All right  It's not in the quarter, though  I can take you to one  It's not in the quarter, though  Fine, good man  Tom, what is the name  Of that place?  Well, that was  Oh, damn  That hung up  Oh, no, he's still talking  He's still babbling  So, we were talking 
[02:57:30]  To Ralphie May  During commercials  And I was  You know, feeling him out  He goes  And Ralphie says  He has tsunami jokes  Hey, who doesn't?  Well, yeah  Too soon?  Man, after you see  After you see that  That benefit  With all the stars  And the tragedy  It's just like  Tragic and horrible  You know  Bad recording artist  After bad recording artist  It was  I mean, it's like  Oh, have those people  Suffered enough?  They've got to listen  To Madonna  Butcher John Lennon  Ugh  But there's questions 
[02:58:00]  That have to be asked  Like, um  Where the hell  Are we going to get  Our souvenirs from now?  You know  I know that's horrible  What's the  What's the total  Up to now, anyway?  What's the  A hundred and  Sixty-two thousand  Sixty-two  Something like that  Damn, I took the under  That's all I got  I'm sorry  It's a tough situation  To broach, you know  But I'm getting in there  I'm mixing it up  I'm trying for you  But people are like 
[02:58:30]  Oh, you're  Oh  I told you  I know  That piercing ruins it  The piercing ruins it  Look at that thing  Wait, is that  Is that video of Ralphie  The last time he was in studio?  No, that is  Oh, I'm sorry  This is the  China  One night in China  That piercing ruins  That beautiful, beautiful gift she has  That is a huge  The whole area is big  The whole area is big  Yeah, but if you look closely  It looks like a tiny peenie, you know  It does  That's what it is  That's what it is  Yeah, but that one  But that one really looks at  It's more obvious than others 
[02:59:00]  That one really looks at  No  And as far as tsunami jokes  I haven't done any  Not for any bad reasons  But the only  The most tragic part of the tsunami  Is that  Until they were talking about it on the news  Voss didn't realize the tea was silent  That's a tsunami  What an ignoramus  Oh, look at that thing  Stop it  Dude, you know  The only thing I don't like about it  Is her legs are open  When the legs close a little bit  It looks even more thick  Like that I prefer  No, that thing belongs on LB-426 
[02:59:30]  Jumping out of an egg  And putting  Laying  Laying an embryo in your chest  And wrapping around your neck  To choke you  If you try to remove it  Look at that thing  It's giant  It's fantastic  I just don't like the piercing  Stop with the piercings  Through the hood  It's stupid  How you appreciate the whole thing  But get upset at the piercing  It's beyond me  I don't like tattoos down there  It's beyond me  The piercing is not natural  I like  I'm into that  On the woman  I mean 
[03:00:00]  You know it's good  You like pussy  Dude, I love it  And I like the fact  That it's just thick  And the morbid there is  The better  And I don't like the piercing  Because it's not natural  The worst piercing  Is the nipple piercing  That is just the worst  No, because you've always got  The other one you can go to  Or when they put a  What if they do them both  Yeah, they'll do both  And also when they put  The tattoo on their boobs  Belladonna did that  That is awful  What did she shave  Like five minutes ago  And she's already got the shadow  Looks like he's kissing  Fred Flintstone's mouth  Look at that though 
[03:00:30]  Look how far over  Those bumps are  I mean  That's a huge bush  Oh, I know  Look how far over it goes  If she let that thing grow out  Oh, God  Can you imagine the bush on that  That's like 70's porn bush  Looked like Link  From the Mod Squad  Eaten in Nathan's  Eaten in Nathan's  That big schlong she's got  She's fantastic  But get the dumb piercing out  She's got a  What is that, a scar? 
[03:01:00]  It's probably a C scar  Or maybe she had an injury  Does she have a kid?  I don't know  That's when they removed  The first penis  Yeah, that's when I'm  Grew back  They had to cut her there  And pull the thing  Pull it through  Pull it back into her body  Oh, nice  Oh, God  That's fantastic  I'd marry a girl  She's the only skinny girl  I've ever seen  With a fupa  What's her  Fat upper pussy area  Oh, yeah  I don't like the bunt  But I like the  Eric, you can turn that off, man  It's way too  Disgusting  It's distracting  I'll watch it  Brian in Jersey

[03:02:00]  True  Yeah  Well, not funny  That's not funny  How are you funny  And still point out  The number of victims  That's the important part  Yeah, right?  Because a third of them  Were kids  And if you can't find  Humor in that  Oh, God  There's something  Kind of, you know  Fun about that  Like, I caused a tsunami  Like, I did a gainer  From 10,000 feet  You know  Fatty's making  He's doing  I think you got  You got to look  At the positive side  I know there were  A lot of children  But just think  Of how many little

[03:03:00]  Yeah, it's very cheap  We were there for 19 days  And we spent $1,200  And we went first class everything  Wow  And we tipped  Nobody else tips  But the worst part about that  It wasn't the Thai people  It was like the Swedes  And the dirty Germans  Okay  And  The dirty Krauts  And the dirty Germans  I hate them  And they were assholes  To everybody  And then every time  Because they were white  So that's all that  Our media showed  As victims  Oh, I know  We were talking about that

[03:29:00]  And they expect  The show the next day  That's 19 hours of work  Are they insane  What are we  Working in a sweat factory  With 2.15  And then that whole time  More Nikes  More Nikes  You're gonna make  More Nikes  Well it used to be  An old printing shop  Or mill  I mean it  You make more Nikes  Right now  10.30 to 11.30  Show planning  With Elo and Straylo  Alright  That's acceptable  Talk about what's going on  That will truly help us 
[03:29:30]  That's fine  All these other meetings  What you'll see  Is us just nodding a lot  Like one hour  After the show  Is all that is needed  With these people  Well 11.30 to 12.30  Is a working lunch  2005 Corp Vision  Panero  Okay that's you  Logan etc  So we have to sit there  And have a meeting  With  Well that's not bad either  I'm just gonna sit  And chat with etc  This etc guy  And you guys  Can hang out  With the rest  And I'll just sit there  And acknowledge  That it is 2005  Ope you can deal  With the bosses 
[03:30:00]  Here's the best  So then we have  The working lunch  And that will wrap  At 12.30  So from 12.30  To 1.30  It's kind of a wrap up  Where you're saying  Goodbye to people  And getting yourself  Out of there  And you check out  Of the hotel  And guess what  At 1.30  Opie  Anthony  Ben Sparks  Eric  And Martini Steve  All get to go  To the train station  At 1.30  Back on the choo choo  So everyone leaves  Except  And it says it right here  Jim Norton 
[03:30:30]  And then Jim Norton  From 1.30  To 4.30  To 4.30  Three hours  Will be hanging  In human resources  For  Sensitivity training  Sensitivity training  With Ann Kay  And Elo  Ann Kay  And Elo  For sensitivity training  For three hours  Do you understand  You would have had  A better shot  If you would have  Written Jim Norton  Will model his abs  And get a job  With Ford modeling  You would have 
[03:31:00]  Had a better shot  At the  If you think  I'm staying down there  And going through  Sensitivity training  You are out  Of your fucking mind  It's not happening  Sensitivity training  Maybe you could send  Someone from  Human resources  In  And they can  Tickle my bag  A little  I can go  Ooh  Very sensitive area  And then they can leave  Oh my god  Oh yeah  That's gonna be fun  I smell  I smell promo  Corporate diva 
[03:31:30]  This just is not happening  Under any circumstances  Will that  Will that  That's not happening  They're making y'all  Take the train  How long is that  Like three hours  That's actually fine  Train's fine  We don't mind a train  We don't mind that  How about we have  The sensitivity meeting  On the train  Three hours  Don't you understand  You have a better chance  Of Michael Corleone  Just handing the children  Over to Kay  That is more likely  Than me staying  For that horrendous  Three hour meeting  They're horrible man 
[03:32:00]  That is  Wow  Here's how that  Should be worded  And by the way  XM people  Jim Norton  My girlfriend says  Is a gentleman  And  She doesn't believe  All the hype  That he's a scumbag  And  And she loves him  To death  Thank you  I'm very nice  To the girlfriend  I mean I'm a very  Respectful guy  And the meeting  Should go like this  1.30  Human resources  Attempts to talk  About sensitivity training  1.30  5  They are wiping saliva  That Jim Norton  Has spit on them  Off of themselves 
[03:32:30]  As he walks outdoor  That's how that meeting goes  Hand out hankies  On the way in  Jim we don't like a lot  End of meeting  If I ever beat  A black man to death  In New Orleans  And sit on his face  Until he suffocates  I am more than deserving  Of some sensitivity training  I'm a stand up comic  Who hates his own guts  That is not happening  This  Is not happening 
[03:33:00]  Not just your Tuesday  Three hour meeting  Guys they want us  To do this once a month  By the way  This isn't happening  Well you know something  They've completely  Turned me off  To going down there  And doing anything  Well it was supposed to be  Because  XM people  Don't you know  That's why they agreed  To do your network  So they didn't have to do  This dumb shit  I will circle this  There it is  Monday  1030 to 1130  Meeting  ELO  Future show planning  Objectives  Setting of the vision  Acceptable  That's the meeting 
[03:33:30]  Listener care  Bap  No  Working lunch  No  I'm scratching out working  There you go  Lunch  I'll keep lunch  Lunch  I'll keep lunch  Lunch good  But that's it  Keep lunch  Break  I'm keeping break  And I'm changing  The 12  To a 1  There you go  1230 to 145  Investor conference  What about system training  Oh where is that  We don't have to push any buttons  Oh I don't care about that  Because I'm not involved  Nope Steve and Eric  Can you guys fight your own 
[03:34:00]  Battle on that one  That's you guys  Investor conference  Is off  It just ain't happening  They might give us  A little inside info  Though that we could  Use wisely  No that can be done  In the prep meeting  That can be done  In the prep meeting  Right before the Rams  They can give us  Any information we have  To on the way  You know what  Buy low  Sell high  There you go  There's my input  Greed is good  End of meeting  End of meeting  Break  Another break  From 330 to 345 
[03:34:30]  But I see it's the  Human resources  Legal 2005 policy  Goes to 415  So now the break  Goes from 330 to 415  There you go  That's a nice long break  Yeah we're doing  Satellite radio  Anything goes  That is a nice break  Building of the shows  Next steps  Experts  Structure syndication  Etc  What is that  Who is that with  I like that actually  No no but that goes  I don't like it  At 415 to 530  No that goes  In the meeting  From 1130  Oh okay  I'll put an arrow  You make two  Instead of 45 minutes 
[03:35:00]  In an hour  You add 15 minutes  On to that first meeting  And that covers both  They become one meeting  Alright because we're  Not going to listen or care  So 111030  To 1145  Is the first meeting  No the only meeting  And only meeting  The meeting  The meeting  No one is missing  From this whole schedule  By the way  Marketing of the show  Ah yes  One thing we care about  Well that may come  Under the heading  Of expert structure syndicate  That may come  Under next steps  I hope so  Because they said  They had big plans 
[03:35:30]  For marketing the show  In 2005  Okay let's go  We heard that for  Months  I think it means  They're going to get me  A 5X to large shirt  Then they have  Travel to hotel  We don't need that  Because we've been  Checked in for the whole day  Before  Idiots  A prep meeting with Elo  Before the Ram dinner  We don't need that  Absolutely not  Because we don't need  The Ram dinner  I like it  It says cocktails  With Rams  I'm just going to  Cross out with Rams  And put hotel bar  Cocktails with Ben  At hotel bar 
[03:36:00]  That's right  And then for  What time is that at?  That's 630 to 730  Okay so at 930  After dinner  Carry Ben to room  I can't forget that  I'm laughing too hard  Carry Ben to room  There's no way  There's no way  There's no way  We're going to  Ben a little  Drunky Brewster  Oh god I love it  There's no way  We're going to  Attempt to travel  Back to the hotel  Starting at 930  Under no circumstances  No way  I'm already an hour  And a half  Into my sleep  No way 
[03:36:30]  Hair of the dog  That combed it  Ben is this serious?  Your brush is no good  Here Mr. Lawrence  No wonder  Nothing gets done  Down there  Because this is  Probably an example  Of what all these  Guys have to do  Well no this is  How they lay out  Their days down there  I wouldn't comb  One hair on his  God damn little head  I think it's fine  That Jim's got to  Stay longer  It's not happening  I think Ben  Should go to a barber  When do you think 
[03:37:00]  Maybe Ben should  Go to a barber  As soon as possible  Why are you raking him  In his gall hair  Ben don't you go  Into room 151  That's on the bottle  Of Bacardi  So yeah  So that's the deal  Alright  I got my schedule  And I'm happy with it  I'm going to  Photocopy Anthony's  And say that  That is my schedule  As well  There it is  This is amazing  I think he actually  Left the human resource  Meeting  No he knows better 
[03:37:30]  There it is  There you go  Now it's  Now it's  The Jim Norton schedule  130 to 430  Instead of HR  Sensitivity training  Put laughing on train  With friends  As we zip north  Through Philadelphia  As they sit there  Looking at their watches  Wondering when you're  Going to arrive  Exactly  For the meeting  Maybe the next time  I go down  You can have  Promptness meetings  Because I missed this  For a month  Take staggering  Trip to bar car 
[03:38:00]  Pretty much it  Let's say hi to Bill  In Texas  Go ahead Bill  Hey they are  Absolutely fucking  With you guys  There is no way  They intend for you  To do all that  They have got to be  Sitting back there  Laughing their ass  It has to be a joke  It's not a joke  I'm telling you  Because last time  We were down there  Straylow was going  From meeting to meeting  To meeting  With the clipboard  And I was thinking  To myself  And this is no radio bit  I'm thinking  How is he supposed  To implement  The stuff he's learned  In these meetings  If he's going to  Other meetings  There's never time  To actually implement 
[03:38:30]  Any of this shit  See this is the thing  Dude corporate people  All corporate people  This would be a joke  They don't know  How awful their lives are  They don't know  How awful meetings are  Because they go to meetings  They don't understand  That when you tell  Someone on the outside  You have to do  A day of meetings  How  It's just an impossibility  It's an impossibility  It's impossible  It's impossible  And we'll be rolling tape  In all these meetings  All of them  All of them  Make sure we have that  Ben I'm telling you  Tell Steve  I cannot  And we're going to have 
[03:39:00]  A big sign  That is on the wall  Saying we are  Taping for broadcast  They can't just let us  Meet with the people  We need to meet with  I'm sure everyone was  We don't do well  O&A are coming down  They're going to do  Their show  And then they're  Available for meetings  Oh we better get them  Into human resources  We better get them in  Unbelievable  What are they going to  Schedule like  Commercial taping  That y'all could  Tape a commercial  Yeah how about that  That's funny  That would promote  Your show  Promote the show  Or like take pictures  For billboards 
[03:39:30]  Across the nation  There you go  And buses  And taxi cabs  So you've noticed  That there's no real  Promotion  Yeah there's nothing  As far as our radio show  The only thing I've seen  With XM, Opie and Anthony  Is Jim Norton  When he did Tough Crowd  Yep  That's the only time  And by the way  As soon as I get  But we bring this up  And they get mad at us  We just want this show  To succeed  Hey give me a 5XL shirt  Or give me a tapeworm  So I can get down  To that 3X one  They sent me  In fairness  Let's see what they do  Maybe they have somebody  They did say 05 was the plan 
[03:40:00]  So maybe they have it all laid out  I don't want to jump on them  Because they might already  Have some ideas  Did you see the meeting  For the photographer  And the camera crew  Nope  Exactly  It's not happening fellas  Alright Lori from Wisconsin  Yes Lori  Good morning  Hi Lori  It's a girl  I think I'm the token female  For the day  No no no such thing  As a token  Not in the new  Sensitive Opie and Anthony program  That's right  Not with Jim Norton  Ultra sensitive man  That's right  I apologize for all those things  I've said  I didn't need them  Sensitive new age guy  I'm in my car  Just laughing my ass off  Because I feel so sorry 
[03:40:30]  For you guys  That this is not a joke  Because I just left  The corporate America  Bullshit world  And I don't know  Who made  Did you guys make the mistake  Of saying you guys  Wanted to schedule a meeting  No no no  Or was this planned  In the first place  No it was presented  In your mouth  Saying that you  Wanted to schedule  Here's what happened  Here's what happened  We were going to Vegas  And we voiced it on the air  That there were a lot  Of miscommunications  Between us and Washington  Part of the reason  Because us being in New York  And them being in Washington  We really don't get a lot 
[03:41:00]  Of what they call  Face time  Face to face  To voice our ideas  So they go  Between a few intermediaries  And maybe some things  Get lost in the translation  Some priorities  Get thrown around  And some of our wants  And needs  Don't get met  So we had a meeting  With Elo  At the CES in Vegas  And we decided  We would come down  And do the show  From Washington  For two days  Which should be good enough  By the way  Because then people  Get to know us  In the hallways  A little bit  When we get lunch  Have a couple of meetings 
[03:41:30]  We'd have a few of the people  On the show  It would be nice  And then maybe a couple  Of meetings after the show  The meetings I envisioned  After the show  Was marketing  A couple of marketing people  Elo  And us sitting around  Discussing what would be  The best way to market  And promote the Opie and Anthony show  What's some content  That we can now bring  Into the program  Newer material  How to get the show  To the next level  To the next level  That did not include  Human resources meetings  It didn't include  Meeting with  Aftermarket  Regional area managers  It didn't include 
[03:42:00]  Meeting with  OEM panel  It didn't include  Meetings with  Institutional shareholders  It didn't include  Corporate vision  It's about the show  And it's about  Doing the show  From Washington  Not exhausting us  The investors conference  Is two hours?  Two hours!  With the most boring people  You've ever met  Of course they are  Here's the meeting  By the way  I want to have  With the car companies  Hey Jim  We have a GM  Honda and Toyota  Which one of these vehicles  Would you like to be driving?  Which 2005 model 
[03:42:30]  Can we offer you  For perhaps a third  Of what you should pay for  Because we're happy  You're on board  Very good  They'll give them to you  I don't mind  If they don't give it  I don't want to  You know  That's the meeting  I'll be involved with  In a car  Let's go to Catherine  Catherine  Hey  How you doing guys?

[03:43:30]  I might have a banana smoothie  I will show you  The error of your ways  If they want synergy  We'll give them synergy  You get to share  In his lovely gas too  You have no idea  What I will be doing  In those meetings  It's going to smell like  An offshore oil drill  Rick  Oh great  Oh alright  Well there you have it  Thanks Ben  For giving us material  Wow Ben  Wow Ben  You know the funny thing  Is too  Is Eric  Wait wait  It's a funny thing

[03:49:30]  Did XM have a huge binder  With the master plan  That they wouldn't show you  Remember that from the old days then  True  The master plan  The master plan  I just want to  Have a meeting about  How to make the show better  How to get more guests on the show  Maybe some experts  In some fields  How they're going to market the show  Are they going to take us off  The premium channel  That type of stuff  Things like that  They need to do that  Things like that  They need to do that  They need to open you all up  And all the rest of this stuff 
[03:50:00]  Is just a waste of time  We'll nod a lot  And that's it  Yeah  That's going to be a waste of time  Complete and total waste of time  I will not  Mark my words  I will not be part of this  I will not be  I will go to any meeting  After the show  That involves  Eric Logan  And some very  High end  Marketing people  Yep  To discuss the program  Where we want it to go  And the marketing of  The program  I will not be in  The XM building 
[03:50:30]  Any later than  I'll be realistic  1.30 maybe  Yeah after lunch  I'm done  I'm done  So sneak out  Whatever you want to do  For those three hours  Is great  You know that  We were at  WNW for six years  And we never even  Acknowledged the  Human Resource  Lady or her  Department  Never even  Acknowledged her  All they do  In Entertainment  Human Resources  Is they remove  The humor  From everything  Oh they do  And look  Let's be honest  For as much as  We are pigs on the air  No one here 
[03:51:00]  Has any type of  Sexual harassment issues  We don't have any  I mean we've  Teased people on the air  We don't interact  In the office  Rudely with other people  Under no circumstances  Am I having one of those  Awful meetings  Yeah as soon as we  Leave this little  Environment that is  The ONA show  The studio here  That's it  We're not animals  We know how to act  In society  What do you think  We run out there  Grab the wiffle ball bat  And chase women around  Outside the studio  All right  You still got it  It happened maybe  Three or four times  The most  Here's the human resources 
[03:51:30]  Meaning how to better  Interact with co-workers  It should be with us  Human resources  And a moving company  With a truck  And we can say  How to get that furniture  Into the truck faster  Get everyone else  Out of here  Yeah that's how  You deal with us  Why are these people here  Are these guys support  For you  For y'all  No they're just  Is this the only show shot  I mean  No there's a  There's a couple guys  That kind of  It's like music  You know from another  That tiny little closet  Over there  That's about it  But they think  So who are these  Other people  But they think  They're important 
[03:52:00]  Because they can  Figure out what goes  Next to like  Frank Sinatra's  Summer Wind  You know  Yeah  That's about it  Really  Why are they even here  They should be in D.C.  This should be like  The outlaws  Well trust me  A little stepchild  You want to talk  Another memo  Justin from Washington  Yeah  Oops  You're going to have  To show up  At one of the meetings  Now  You just suggested  Something  Very insensitive  Good idea  I've got to change  My whole schedule  That's it  I've got to fly in  Next Monday  Ralphie you can't  Go home to sunny L.A. 
[03:52:30]  You made a suggestion  Now you've got to  Follow it up  With 20 hours of meetings  I'm sitting in there  With Norton  And get the sensitivity  Traded  Going Norton  Please  Shoot me  Stand me in my eye  Please  As far as stop whining  It's one day at work  Look I went home yesterday  And slept for five hours  I slept for five hours  I went out  And I did four shows  Yeah  And I tried to sleep  And I overslept  There's no way  You know what  It's not about that  I would spend  Honestly  Six hours in Washington  If I knew 
[03:53:00]  In meetings  If I knew  It was going to make  This show better  I will sit for six hours  And take any suggestion  That's going to make  This radio show better  But this other stuff  Is just a waste of time  That has nothing to do  With Anthony and I  And Norton  And everybody else  Putting on a  Clever  Entertaining  Funny show  You want to have a lunch  Where you say hello  I don't mind that  I don't mind saying hi  To people  Meeting people  I will spend six hours  Schmoozing people  That might make our show better  Whether they're experts  Or other comedians  Or show prep experts 
[03:53:30]  Whatever  I don't know  But this other stuff  Is a complete waste of time  Yeah  Absolutely  And know what it's going to  Know what it's going to do  You watch  Tuesday's show  Is going to be so  God damn awful  Because we're going to be  So tired  I know  Because that's what  Ends up happening  Yep  And I'll wonder how it goes  You'll be on a train  Because you know what  The other reality is  Leave  Fucking leave  We joke about this  But the reality is  Every day we spend  A good three or four hours  After the show is over  Working on the next show  I know it doesn't sound like it 
[03:54:00]  Some days  And we fall flat on our faces  But the reality is  We're constantly trying  To make the show better  And preparing for the next show  That's right  You notice that  We're not going to  Be able to do anything  Except maybe read a newspaper  Really fast  In the van from the hotel  To the compound  Tuesday morning  Yeah  Because I'm not going to  Be in the mood  To try to attempt  To get anything together  For the next day  Of course not  Yeah there's nothing  On there  They don't understand  There's nothing on here  That includes  Prepping for the next day's show  I mean 
[03:54:30]  They gave us  No time  For the show  To hang out  Or for us to go back  To wherever we're going  And look online  Read some papers  Magazine  Nothing  And I'm kind of pissed off  Not kind of  The word marketing  Isn't anywhere on this thing  Not once  Is it mentioned  You're thinking  It might be  In one of these meetings  There needs to be  But marketing  Is number one  On our list  What the effort  Are they going to do  To make this show  You know  Bigger  Right  You know  Because you got 
[03:55:00]  Competition coming  Making it  More aware  To the  The current  XM Nation  Which we're close to  We're only talking  To what  One, two percent  I don't even know  Of the entire  XM Nation  And then there's  All these people  Out there  That would love  This show  If it was marketed  Properly  And believe me  And he's right  Competition is showing up  Soon  And you want to be  Playing catch up  Because it wasn't done  I don't want to 
[03:55:30]  Jump the gun  And say they don't  Because they said  They did  So they very well might  They said they did  For 2005  Yeah so they might man  It's only January  What 18th  Instead of talking  About that  We'll discuss  Content in  Automotive environment  Whatever that  Even means  I don't even know  What that means  Premium channel  So people like  When I'm in a car  The only way  I hear y'all  Is they play  Like excerpts  Of it on  Like 151  Or something  Yeah  All right  There's nothing man  I mean you gotta be  Off the premium channels  Because they don't do that  For like Hertz  And Avis 
[03:56:00]  And stuff like that  Maybe we could discuss  Things like that  At the Ram dinner  Hey Mike from Boston  You ass  He writes  You dumb asses  In corporate America  Everyone has to go  Take stupid sexual harassment  Train and quit your bitching  This was never supposed  To be a corporate job  Don't you get it  Shut up  You know what radio  Was all about  Before these stupid  Lawyers and suits  And corporate people  Got involved  It was a bunch of guys  That were losers  And hippies  That just got high  And did drugs  Came into a radio station  And played their favorite music  That's what this was  Supposed to be 
[03:56:30]  And now it's like  Now they  They invented  A human resource  Department  A human resource  For people like us  That do radio  Are you insane  And as far as  Sexual harassment  You know  I don't need some  Corporate idiot  Telling me about it  I was raised properly  And I'm a pervert  When I spend my money  I don't walk up to  Girls in the office  And grab my crotch  Because I was raised right  I know not to act that way  Isn't it insulting  That they think  You have to go to a meeting  To learn how to be  A human being  That you're not  Going to go around  With your slong  Hanging out  And walk into a cubicle 
[03:57:00]  And slap girls  In the face with it  And if you do  Maybe you send them  To training  To not have those  Big tits showing  During the work day  Yeah those dirty bitches  With their big titties  Oh you filthy dirty animals  Yeah we get blamed  Yeah  We have not behaved  I just gotta be  Man it's  Enough already  What did we learn  On the show today  Well  I'm not even officially  Part of the show  But I just feel  Outraged for you  And not just  Yeah but we bring  This stuff up  We bring this stuff up  All the time

[03:58:00]  A nice clever  Not nice  But a clever  Entertaining  Radio show  And it's a funny show  And it's pertinent  And it's edgy  And outrageous at times  Well yeah  It's pertinent  And it's  New  I mean it's relevant  The show is like  This should be  On like  A regular channel  Like have your own channel  But enough with the hiding  The show  The show is pretty much  Hidden  Yeah  And with  And with that  We've done very very well  They're extremely happy  With the amount of people  Listening to the show  But we're not
