<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a humorous bit about a fictional "ONA virus," quickly transitioning into their usual Monday morning banter.  Jimmy Norton, a frequent guest, was in studio. They misidentified an audio clip before a caller, Phil from San Francisco, complimented Norton's recent performance.  The conversation turned to Norton's weekend bowling outing at the dilapidated Port Authority Bus Terminal, including a competition with someone called "Iraq" and a friend, Patty, who brought her own vintage bowling ball.  Norton also recounted unexpectedly receiving a presidential suite at a hotel.

The hosts then shifted to the World Series, expressing disinterest due to the absence of New York teams and launching into a crude critique of female sports announcers, speculating on the reasons behind their presence.  The discussion veered into racially charged and offensive jokes regarding Barack Obama's presidential candidacy. A news report about a marathon runner suffering a brain hemorrhage was played, followed by more offensive jokes from the hosts, particularly targeting Obama.  They also discussed the movie "The Bridge," focusing on the suicides depicted and the reactions of the families, alongside promoting their upcoming Halloween party, a planned Tourette's Syndrome segment, and the "Fatty Pig Fatty" contest. A video of a base jumper's death was also mentioned.

The show continued with further discussion of "The Bridge," including a detailed recounting of a memorable scene,  followed by a news story about a teenager charged with felony murder after a car crash believed to be a suicide attempt.  A caller, Deanna, prompted more discussion of "The Bridge," despite her request to avoid spoilers.  The hosts then speculated crudely about Stephen Hawking's divorce.  A staff football-picks contest was discussed, with Steve in the lead despite his limited knowledge.  A major segment focused on the "Fatty Pig Fatty" contest, which Honey, a 505-pound woman, won, accompanied by her husband and a recruiter. The hosts' initial reluctance to criticize Honey was noted, along with a caller expressing concern about the contest's tone. A call from a man who jumped from the Golden Gate Bridge and survived was mentioned, along with an interview with actors from "Mississippi Burning" and "Saw 3." Bill Burr was a guest, promoting his appearance in "Comics Come Home."

Tobin Bell and Shawnee Smith, actors from the *Saw* franchise, were interviewed.  The conversation covered the *Saw* films, the actors' experiences filming increasingly gruesome traps (with Bell detailing a disturbing scene from *Saw 2*), and Smith's singing on the soundtracks and juggling her acting career with coaching little league. The hosts commented on the contrast between Smith's real and on-screen voices.  A caller mentioned a child who had seen the *Saw* movies.  The discussion then shifted to Anthony Cumia's clear infatuation with Shawnee Smith, with the hosts relentlessly teasing him about his shy and awkward behavior during the interview, replaying clips to highlight his blushing and nervous body language.  Anthony vehemently denied any impropriety, claiming to be a mere "fan." The teasing continued throughout the segment.

The teasing of Anthony's crush on Shawnee Smith continued, with the hosts replaying clips and using descriptive terms like "shoulders up" and "hiding behind the mic" to exaggerate his behavior.  Sexually suggestive jokes about Smith and Anthony’s demeanor were made.  Listener calls and attempts to get Smith back on the air were featured.  The hosts also discussed Paul McCartney and Heather Mills, and Daniel Radcliffe's upcoming nude scene.  A call with sex advice expert Sue Johansson who discussed rough anal sex was included. Mark Cuban was mentioned as a possible guest but didn’t appear.

The final segment heavily featured the ongoing teasing of Anthony's infatuation with Shawnee Smith, with Opie and Jimmy Norton adopting the roles of "doctors" analyzing his behavior.  The conversation included graphic descriptions and jokes about anal and rough sex, with Bill Burr adding to the chaotic atmosphere. Mark Cuban called in to discuss HDNet's programming, including a reality show about a threesome.  Calls with a blind phone sex worker complaining about unpaid wages and "Club Soda Kenny" mispronouncing "foliage" were also featured.  The show concluded with Shawnee Smith calling back, confirming that Cumia's feelings were mutual, and a playing of her song from the *Saw* soundtrack, followed by closing remarks and banter from the hosts.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show on XM202, featuring O.P., Anthony, and James Norton.  The infection was everywhere.  It was in the street outside.  It was coming through your windows.  It was a virus.  Terrible viral infection gives people this incurable disease,  fills their veins and blood with their pure rage.  By the time they tried to evacuate the cities, it was already too late.  Jesus Christ, five hours?  It infects, replicates, and kills this fast?  These numbers can't be right.  The numbers are correct.  I wish to God they weren't. 
[00:00:30]  Is that one?  There is no God.  It's like some kind of horror movie.  It's such a great virus that you want to infect others, like your friends and co-workers.  Sometimes it leaves pustules.  There's nothing you can do about it.  God Almighty.  We need to stop this outbreak before it mutates.  They're highly contagious.  What's this rash from?  We're facing a new strain.  It can cause life-threatening bleeding or even asphyxiation.  Where is it spreading?  All over the place.  All right, we're coming out.  Here we go.  I'm a boredom. 
[00:01:00]  Anthony.  I'm a little dirty.  Wipe me.  James Norton.  Boom.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  Oh.  Stretch, stretch, stretch, stretch, stretch, stretch, stretch, stretch, stretch, stretch.  Rise and shine, porcupine.  Is it really Monday?  Good morning.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Come on, everybody. 
[00:02:00]  Wake up.  Rise and shine.  Shut up.  Shut up.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  We have lots to do today.  Good evening to you, sir.  Good evening.  Good evening to you, sir.  Might as well be.  Well, it's still evening to some people out there.  Uh-oh.  Sounds like somebody's got a case of the Mondays.  The Mondays.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  One of the greatest actresses ever, Kathy Bates. 
[00:02:30]  She's great in everything she does.  Is that her?  Did you see her in About Schmidt?  Oh, that's not Kathy Bates?  No.  What?  No, that's from Office Space.  Oh, my God.  Every time you play that, I'm thinking that's Kathy Bates.  Uh-oh.  Sounds like somebody's got a case of the Mondays.  It kind of sounds like it could be her from, uh...  It does sound like it.  At least you're going to help me out a little bit.  Yeah, it does sound like her.  Oh, I'm an idiot.  Kind of looked like her, too.  Just some fat broad.  Yeah. 
[00:03:00]  Receptionist.  Our phone number's 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  Want to say hi to the millions of people listening to us on commercial radio?  I want to say hi to the millions of people listening to us on satellite radio.  Hi.  And, of course, the billions of people across the world tuning in right now.  Billions?  Billions!  That's right, billions!  What?  What happened?  Oh, the music ran out.  What?  Hello?  You mean...  Hello? 
[00:03:30]  What?  All right, let's go right out to San Francisco and say hi to Phil.  Hey, Phil.  Phil?  What's going on?  Phil Connors.  Phil?  Hello.  What's going on, guys?  He's in San Francisco.  Hello, Phil.  Ned?  Ned Ryerson?  I love the Groundhog's Day.  Yeah, what's up, Phil?  Dear Jimmy, you killed on Saturday night, man.  You were awesome.  Oh, thank you, Phil.  Yes.  Very sweet of you to say that.  Jimmy Norton.  What a kind man you are to call.  Isn't he? 
[00:04:00]  Quite an enjoyable trip, actually.  I love San Francisco.  I never realized how big of a head Kenny had.  I met Club Soda Kinney for the first time.  Kenny.  He's huge.  Club Soda Kinney.  Does he really have a big head?  I always thought it was small and tapered.  He's got big and everything else.  But his whole body is big.  If you put that head on a normal body, it would look big.  It would be wobbly.  Yeah.  It'd be like, whoa.  Set up some kind of a structure to hold it up straight.  Yeah.  Put the shoulders.  All right.  Jimmy killed in San Francisco. 
[00:04:30]  Jimmy's back with us today.  Don't forget, he's going to be on Letterman.  It's either November 1st or 2nd now.  I don't know.  I don't know what that is.  Yeah.  We're all confused.  We'll figure it out.  We don't know.  How was everyone's weekend?  Ah.  Very fun.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We went out.  Partied with a few of the pests.  Yeah.  On Saturday night.  Got to keep them happy.  It's a smart thing to do.  It's fun.  Went out there.  And then apparently there's bowling available at the Port Authority bus terminal. 
[00:05:00]  Did you know this?  No.  That there's upstairs.  There's also drug dealing and gang activity and prostitution.  It is just the dregs of society are there.  I think Al Qaeda has business meetings there.  Yeah.  What the hell are you doing?  It was, well, it was Patrick's birthday.  My sister's, well, boyfriend.  But who knows how far that'll go with Fez trying to step in.  But it was his birthday, so Dawn made plans and we all went out to dinner and then went 
[00:05:30]  bowling over there.  Oh, everybody.  Oh, we had your pet from Monaki.  Can I ask you something?  Why?  Yeah.  Why would you go bowling there?  Or was this like...  I have no idea.  This was all set up by Dawn.  Wait, this was planned ahead of time to go bowling at the Port Authority?  Yeah, I guess they wanted a bowling alley that was close enough to the place that we  were eating that everyone could walk there, which is kind of smart so everybody didn't  have to get into cars or cabs because we had a lot of people. 
[00:06:00]  And we all just went in one big, like, crowd over to the bowling alley.  But it was in the Port Authority bus terminal.  Hey, what you doing?  You got a quarter?  You know how the pests are?  Very charitable.  Get out of here, you N.  You know?  We actually just became our own gang, so no one bothered us.  We were like the biggest group of people in there, so no one really bothered. 
[00:06:30]  And yeah, bowling.  Half the place was torn down.  I don't know if they were rebuilding or a bomb went off.  It was just plastic was over half the bowling alley.  They have that other bowling alley that's really nice with the colored pans and the lasers.  Why would we go there?  And the video screens and rock music.  Why go there?  The psychedelic bowling alley.  There's one right at the Port Authority bus terminal.  Why would you go somewhere else?  Old school bowling show, right?  Oh, yeah.  This wasn't about music and lights and things like that. 
[00:07:00]  It was just you hoped the scoreboard worked, and that was it.  Me and Iraq got in a little friendly competition there, first game.  Iraq's on a league, you know?  Really?  Yeah, apparently.  2-2, something like that.  Are you on two bowling leagues?  No.  No?  Are you on a bowling league?  No.  Why was I told you were on a bowling league?  How about you use the mic?  It was a long time ago.  Oh, okay.  Because I could tell he had a style and everything.  Very competitive.  What did he bowl? 
[00:07:30]  124 the first game.  Oh, that's some bowling.  God, you're acting like he's related to Weber.  That's just it.  He bowled a 125, you ass.  Who'd you compete with?  A drummer from Def Leppard?  I bowled a 125, so I beat him.  Oh.  Why are you asking if he's in a bowling league?  125.  No, because that's what I had heard, and he said he was good, and he looked like he knew  what he was doing, but it was very competitive, and then I totally gave up the second game. 
[00:08:00]  I just stunk.  They threw him off the bowling team because his shirts were too awful.  And then, of course, you know, the rest of the crop.  Patty.  Patty, who knew Patty, had her own ball and a bag.  She's coming up with, like, luggage, and we thought she was coming there to live, maybe  thrown out of her apartment or something, and apparently she's got her own bowling ball.  She carried her own bowling ball?  Yeah, in a little rolly bag. 
[00:08:30]  To the big bowling night?  To the big bowling night.  I got my own ball.  So then, of course, the pest hid her ball at the end of the night, and she almost started  crying because she thought it was stolen.  The ball's probably from, like, 1978.  Oh, of course.  I can't imagine it's a brand new ball.  No, she can't afford it.  So that was it.  And then just went to the hotel, and they have to give me a room now these days, which is kind  of pretty cool, because I'm, like, I'm preferred, let's say. 
[00:09:00]  I'm just a preferred guest.  And they had no rooms but the presidential suite.  Never stayed in that one.  Oh, Jesus.  It's, like, the entire floor.  The entire top floor is the presidential suite.  And then there are so many rooms in it, you don't even see the whole thing.  Big media rooms, meeting rooms, kitchen, living rooms, bedrooms.  Not just one bedroom, like, bedrooms and stuff.  You walk around this place, it's a huge apartment. 
[00:09:30]  Giant.  And then we go to bed, and I'm saying to my girlfriend, I'm like, who do you think slept  in this bed?  Oh, president.  You know?  I guarantee a president.  And then all I know is, like, all over the bedspread with these blonde hairs.  So I don't know what was going on.  Blonde women's hairs.  Oh, those are the hookers.  Those are the high-priced prostitutes.  Or wigs.  Hi, Daddy.  Or the wigs.  There you go.  Look at Harlan Monroe's hair.  Yeah, it could have been.  Very nice.  It's very exciting.  Yeah, it sounds like you had a great weekend.  Yeah. 
[00:10:00]  Would they charge you for the presidential suite, or did they charge you for a regular room?  No, they charged me for a regular room.  He's a preferred customer, so they have to give him a room, and that was the only room  that was available.  It's, like, a ridiculous amount, too.  I think the presidential suite goes for something like $2,200 a night.  Really?  Yeah.  Wow.  It's ridiculous.  And you don't understand why.  It's just, you know, once you get into the bed, that's pretty much all you're doing.  It doesn't matter what room's around you.  It doesn't matter anything else.  That's a good point.  It's the same bed as the regular rooms that I usually get. 
[00:10:30]  Good point.  Good point.  Well, I stayed up to watch three innings of the World Series.  Oh.  Three innings.  Is that still going on or something?  And I felt like I was, I watched the whole game.  How long do these games go on?  Holy crap.  Just in case you missed it.  No pitch hitter for Molina.  Marusa stays with his hot catcher.  Good rounds to short.  Santiago flips, and that'll do it.  This series is even. 
[00:11:00]  Go Tigers.  There you go.  Go Tigers.  Go.  There you go.  I couldn't tell you if it was exciting.  I mean, what I saw was exciting, the first three innings, and that was, I don't know,  that was around 11 o'clock at night.  A bit commented on the viewership, the ratings of the series, of people watching, not giving  a crap, because once the New York teams are out of it, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Detroit.  I can't get interested. 
[00:11:30]  You've got to get into Detroit.  It's all about Detroit this year.  I can't be interested about the World Series.  I can't.  Baseball, like you just commented, difficult enough to watch.  If none of your local teams are in it, impossible to watch.  Well, and the World Series, too.  I think the first pitch was thrown at it, like, 820.  Mellencamp was supposed to come out to sing a song, his hit song, and everyone had a hit  song, I guess, and everyone had to wait for freaking John Mellencamp to show up.  They didn't know what to do.  They had a back, you know, a band that was backhand, whatever, and they were just standing 
[00:12:00]  at home plate, just riffing.  No, just waiting, just standing there awkwardly, because they announced Mellencamp, and he never  showed up.  And then he finally showed up, like, a couple minutes later.  No one commented where the hell he was?  No.  Did he make the news?  And then he walked out there all miserable looking.  He looks just miserable, that guy.  I'm sure he is.  And then he sung his stupid song, and they were able to finally play ball.  He's another one of these guys that just, you know, it's his past, you know? 
[00:12:30]  Everyone wants to hear the hits, and he probably gets up there, writes some new songs, and then  people are like, oh, this is garbage.  Can you play, like, Small Town?  Well, the new song's getting a bit of a buzz.  Is it?  Yeah, it's about American stuff.  Of course.  I forgot the name of the song offhand.  Paint Out America, U&B.  All the town story.  Yeah, something like that.  Some working class guy.  Just a boy who makes good.  In his hometown.  Right.  Who's the bimbo that does the pregame?  We were discussing this at my house yesterday. 
[00:13:00]  It's like, I can't.  I don't even care how good they are.  I hate female announcers.  I hate them.  Watching all my football games yesterday, and they got to have this sideline female reporter.  What does she know about football?  You haven't played it.  It's distracting.  What the hell does she know about football?  You know, she could know everything about it.  It doesn't matter.  It just doesn't fit there.  And then they had the broad in the pregame show looking like Farrah Fawcett.  I'm like, I want someone that has played the sport to tell me what I'm about to see. 
[00:13:30]  Now, when you say looking like Farrah Fawcett, do you mean haggard and ragged?  Ah, yeah.  She went old school with her hair.  It's like Farrah Fawcett do.  Oh, the big blown back feathered look.  Yeah, from the 70s and stuff.  And I'm looking like, you're too pretty to be doing the World Series.  I'm sorry.  Sorry.  What?  That marathon runner.  Oh, yeah.  We'll get into that in a little bit as well.  But I can't stomach the female sports announcer. 
[00:14:00]  I can't.  On the sidelines talking about like they played Division I football in college.  They don't know crap.  They've been taught.  They've been told by somebody.  Now, this is the argument I was having with people.  People are saying that.  People are saying.  They were saying.  My friends were saying.  What have you believe?  That the female sports announcers are there to get more females watching sports.  I said, no, it's not.  It's to sex up the game for the guys.  I was thinking that as you were saying. 
[00:14:30]  I'm like, do they think the chicks are going to watch because a woman's talking?  Sex up the game for the guys.  Wait, wait.  What guy gives a flying F if there's some chick babbling on the sideline?  You're watching the game anyway.  I think it's the fringe, you know, guys that aren't like hardcore, but they're taking a peek.  And then this may, you know, keep their interest a little longer having some eye candy.  That's how I think.  Wow.  I'm like Pam Oliver.  They always have awful women doing the sports.  And the announcer.  They're never hot.  I think maybe the women. 
[00:15:00]  They're trying to maybe drag a couple of women.  I think they're dragging women in by having hot pieces of asses.  Where the guy can go, here, honey, she'll explain it to you like a girl.  I don't know.  You both get periods.  Why don't you yap about football?  Maybe someone can explain that to us that it's in the know because I'm trying to figure it out.  Are they there for the guys or the girls?  You know what they should do?  They should be forced to bring chips to the male announcers on commercials.  That's what a female sports announcer should do.  Give me a cup of coffee, honey.  That's right.  And they should hand Bradshaw and JB some chips. 
[00:15:30]  Give me his sweet cheeks.  Where's the dip?  You forgot the dip.  Yeah, who did the World Series yesterday, the pregame?  Because she's talking like she knows everything about baseball.  And she might.  She might study it well.  But I'm like, you've never even attempted to try to hit a curveball once in your life.  I know.  I like when the announcers can say.  You're the one that was banging the baseball players in high school.  It's nice when the announcers can, you know, talk about how they handled a similar situation in the game.  You know, I remember back 68 when I faced this guy, a similar situation, and they get in there and, you know, are able to actually convey what it's like to be in that situation. 
[00:16:00]  Right, right.  What's the woman going to say?  I don't mind Susan Waldman.  Had a rolling pin in my hand and it felt like a bat.  What is she going to say?  Well, Susan Waldman is pretty much a guy, though.  I mean, I'm talking about the, you know, the eye candy.  She's not eye candy.  She's a disaster.  She really is.  She's more of a guy than I am.  I mean, let's be honest. 
[00:16:30]  Is she the one that does the sports also on one of the news channels?  Susan Waldman does Yankee baseball.  And actually, you know what?  There's exceptions to every rule, obviously.  She does sports talk here in New York.  She's very, very good.  She really is.  Yeah.  She really is, which is making me a hypocrite right now.  I understand.  I'm talking more about the eye candy where they're so obviously there just because they look good.  Susan Waldman, actually, she's really good.  Well, Joe Namath showed one of those chicks.  He showed the butchiest one, though. 
[00:17:00]  When he was all drunk.  Thank you.  I want to kiss you.  Ah, fantastic.  That's what you get when you get the broads on the sidelines.  And then they get offended, like, well, you shouldn't be treating her.  Well, then why are you in such a man's atmosphere?  Right.  You wonder how many of them must just get their asses pinched by the players, the other news guys.  And if you remember back in the day when this first started where they started, you know, shoving the female rapports down our throat in sports.  Yeah.  And then the female rapports had to go in the locker room. 
[00:17:30]  And these guys are like, all right, you want to be in our locker room?  Well, take a look at this.  Take a look, honey.  Bet you've never seen these like this.  And then they made some kind of rule where, you know, the guys couldn't be naked in front of female rapports.  And it's like, you're in our environment.  You're just so stupid.  Who wants a girl there when a bunch of guys are nude?  Oh, wait a minute.  So stupid.  Female reporters, what they ought to do is just stand in front of the camera as the game is happening. 
[00:18:00]  Like, that's what they're doing.  As they're killing you the game.  You should just stand there in front of the camera and talk about their day.  And then come back ten minutes later with a black eye and continue talking.  No one wants to hear from them.  Get out of the way.  Right.  All right.  We're just getting started.  We've got lots to do today.  Tyra, we have to do something on Tyra today.  Enough time has gone by.  We can't stand Tyra Banks.  She's out of her mind.  We've got some great audio.  Great audio today.  I'm sure you heard about the Chicago Marathon or by now if you haven't.  Oops.  Oh, my God.  We'll do it right after the break. 
[00:18:30]  Right after the break.  We're playing it on the news all the time.  So if it pops up, I'll point it out.  It's hysterical.  Obama!  We'll get into that a little more today.  You pulled a handle.  It's driving Anthony nuts.  We'll talk about Obama and a lot more things.  Oh, Stephen Hawking's going to go through a divorce.  Stephen Hawking is going to get a divorce.  Yeah.  We've got lots to do today.  We should take a quick break and we'll get going.  What? 
[00:19:00]  Oh, the accusations are great, too.  There can't possibly be accusations.  What is an accusation?  Earth is doomed.  What is an accusation?  What could he do to her?  No, no, no.  Vice versa from what I've heard.  The reverse.  Really?  No, but I heard both.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know I heard she was.  I didn't know he was.  I suppose that he was as well.  Hurting her fist with his face.  All right.  We'll get going in just a minute here. 
[00:19:30]  It's the only virus spreading across America.  The Opie and Anthony Fatty Pig Fatty Contest began like a stampede of hungry rhinos.  But now it more closely resembles a sleepy, winded elephant.  The current heavyweight in the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest is Crystal from Cleveland, who weighed in at 430 pounds.  We're so sure there's someone bigger out there.  We put up a fatty finder's fee in the amount of $1,000 to the person who brings in the heaviest girl by the end of the contest. 
[00:20:00]  So grab your sonar equipment and find us a whale.  Remember, the heaviest girl at the end of the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest gets $10 for every floorboard-shattering, tear-inducing, self-esteem-destroying pound on her body.

Lakes never stop moving.  36-yard return as we check in with Pam Oliver.  Hey there, Dick.  The Washington Redskins were in high spirits as they left the field.  The defense in particular very psyched that they kept the Colts to a field goal going into the half. 
[00:21:00]  Joe Gibbs told me as well that he was extremely pleased with how hard the team is playing.  As for the Colts, I asked Tony Dungy about the injury to Peyton Manning.  He said he gave him a little more extra treatment in the locker room at the half, but he is fine and will go.  Back to you.  I hate that.  I just hate it.  It didn't help at all.  Joe Gibbs said the team is playing well, and Tony Dungy said Peyton Manning got some treatment.  Some extra treatment.  Who couldn't have done that?  Who couldn't have done that?  I don't know why. 
[00:21:30]  Someone in the know has to let us in on what's going on there.  I bet you they were complaining.  I bet you they were complaining there's not enough job opportunities for us because we're being excluded.  Oh, boy.  The whole sports division is just devoid of women.  The boys club.  We need, yeah.  It's football.  Get OJ back on the sidelines.  Come on.  Don't you have a fashion show to go to?  How much time has to go by before you bring OJ back?  Well, they're just scared. 
[00:22:00]  It's too bad because, man, whoever has the balls to hire him as the sideline reporter.  Oh, who's not watching the game?  Who's not watching every single Sunday?  Just look into the eyes of that psychopath as he tells you what's going on on the field.  Who wouldn't watch?  Oh, it'd be great.  I'm back.  Very excited to be back.  Are you, OJ?  Oh, look at that.  Yeah, this is true, too.  I've noticed this.  Chris in Philly, what's up?  Hey, boys.  The best thing about those reporters is when they get the coaches, when they're leaving  the field or coming on, the guys look absolutely pained, fucking like they're talking to their 
[00:22:30]  wives.  Oh, when they have to do the interviews with the women reporters?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, because they're forced to talk to them.  They're forced to talk to the reporters in general, and they just want a freaking coach.  But now the NFL and Major League Baseball and pretty much every league out there has now  forced the coach to say a little something as they're heading to the locker room.  Yeah.  At halftime or whatever.  Exactly.  That's all I got, boys.  Punch it out.  All right.  Thanks.  Moving on to other things. 
[00:23:00]  Chicago.  What's up, Chicago?  There's a cool little video on YouTube.  Just throw Opie and Anthony in the search.  Some guy that lives in Chicago, I guess he lives in a high rise.  And he threw on YouTube a video of Anthony and I on the side of a building.  It's massive.  Massive.  Well, it's a billboard.  It wasn't actually me and you climbing up the side of a building.  Right, right.  That would be awkward.  But we must be like 100 feet high or something like that or this thing because they have 
[00:23:30]  Steve Dahl as well.  It's an advertising for Opie and Anthony and Steve Dahl on WCKG.  And it takes up the entire side of this building.  And this guy that lives in a high rise, he got his video camera.  And all of a sudden, he's just kind of focusing on Chicago in general.  And you're like, all right, yeah, that's Chicago.  We know it.  And all of a sudden, he zooms into this one building and there we are on the side of it.  It's pretty damn cool.  Thank you.  It's really cool.  It's on YouTube if you want to check it out. 
[00:24:00]  Anyway, Chicago had their marathon over the weekend.  Have you seen the video yet, Jimmy?  No, I haven't seen it.  Let me just play this first clip and then we'll get into it a little bit.  Jim is one of 35,000 people who are recovering tonight after the 26.2-mile race.  Also recovering tonight is the winner who took a terrible fall at the finish line.  CBS 2's Katie McCall is live from Northwestern Memorial Hospital where the winner is being  treated for a brain hemorrhage.  And Katie, it appears he slipped on the banner that was on the ground.  Surprisingly, Alita, it does appear that way. 
[00:24:30]  Race officials tell us more than 100,000 runners have run across the finish line and  over that same decal in the past with no problems.  Fortunately, though, doctors here at Northwestern tell us Chariot will recover.  The guy wins the Chicago Marathon.  He puts his hands up as he's going across the finish line.  And they have to have that big, thick, huge decal, you know, at the finish line.  Yeah.  And those things are kind of slippery.  Especially when they're drenched with beer, water. 
[00:25:00]  Who knows?  So he puts his hands up and he just falls backwards right at the finish line and slams his head.  Oh, wow.  Really, really hard.  So he's in the hospital.  How great is the video?  Can you see him clunking his head?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  He clunks.  I mean, bam.  It's almost hard to hear.  Right down on the back of his head.  Obama!  Oh.  I don't like Obama enough with Obama.  He looks like his lips have frostbite.  I don't like the color of his lips.  He always looks cold.  There's cinnamon in the money.  His lip color bothers me.  It looks like he had one of those blue Italian ices and went right onto the show. 
[00:25:30]  Or he's one of those baseball gang members in the Warriors.  One more clip from the Chicago Marathoner.  35,000 people heard the same sound at the start of today's race,  but the sound that came when Robert Chariot hit the pavement at the finish line  was a haunting first for fellow runners and spectators.  You know, we couldn't believe something like that happened.  I've never seen that happen before, and I've seen thousands of race finishes. 
[00:26:00]  Chariot is at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in stable condition  after a victory no one will soon forget.  His moment of triumph turned tragic when he slipped on a decal on the pavement  at the exact moment he crossed the finish line to win.  Chariot suffered bleeding inside his brain,  but he is expected to make a full recovery.  He's slanting that.  Bleeding in his brain?  Yeah, you don't want that.  It'll be great if it happened 10 feet before the finish line.  Well, the second-place finisher was right there, too.  Was he?  Yeah, he almost beat him at the finish line. 
[00:26:30]  Stepped on him.  So, I don't know who won.  They just said in the story, and I still don't know.  Is he from Kenya?  Probably.  Yeah, I would think.  Yeah, they run a lot over there.  They apparently do.  They win all the marathons.  Obama!  No, Obama.  Obama, get excited.  Our change is coming!  No, it isn't.  If you want a change to come...  Obama!  It better not be Obama as the Democratic ticket for the President of the United States. 
[00:27:00]  It just ain't gonna work.  This country is not going to vote in a black man.  Open your mind!  It just ain't gonna happen.  My mind is open.  You gotta open your mind to the rest of this country.  Racism of this country?  Yes!  Sure!  It's just the way it is.  First of all, Democrats...  Here it is.  Democrats are not gonna vote Republican. 
[00:27:30]  They haven't been.  They despise Republicans.  So that's why the vote has been so close the past few years.  Because the Republicans have screwed up so badly.  But still, it's close.  It's, you know, a divided country as far as Democrats and Republicans go.  They get Obama as the guy running for president under the Democratic ticket.  Do you think any Republicans are gonna go, yeah, I'm gonna go for this guy?  Not the hardcore Republicans, but you got those French players.  No! 
[00:28:00]  French players!  Here's what you got more of.  Obama!  Here's what you got more of.  You got more Democrats that are gonna go, I ain't voting for this guy.  Why not?  And we'll bail out because he's a black guy.  Yeah, his slogan's officially, Obama, at least I'm not Mickey Rivers Black.  He went with it.  We suggested it last week.  He went with it.  The batters are being made.  Did they actually go with that?  Yeah.  Oh, Jimmy just saw the marathon runner.  Look, watch.  Oh!  His head bounces three times.  Well, obviously the finish line was wet.  That was the problem. 
[00:28:30]  Wow, second place was right there.  How embarrassing.  If he fell...  Wow!  Oh!  How embarrassing.  How embarrassing.  Embarrassing.  He doesn't care about embarrassing.  He just wants to live at this point.  No kidding.  Anyway, Obama!  Meet the press!  So it doesn't matter what he's on.  So the Democrats, you'll get more Democrats defecting from the ticket than you will Republicans  going over to the ticket.  How about Obama, at least I'm not Hillary? 
[00:29:00]  Well, that'll get him into the Democratic side.  If it's a battle between Hillary and Obama, who gets the Democratic nod?  Yeah.  Then the Democrats have completely dropped the ball.  Yes, Jimmy?  Yes, Jimmy.  I wonder what his slogan will be.  Hey, folks, better an N than a C.  Wow.  He's got some other things going on in his body, though.  He's actually...  I think he's Hawaiian, too.  Oh, really?  No, I don't know. 
[00:29:30]  Where is he?  Yeah, sure.  And what do racists call Tiger Woods?  Just stop.  Doesn't matter.  Obama!  Obama!  You are hysterical.  This country is so not ready.  For a black president, it's got to be a Republican.  Yep.  A black Republican has a shot.  Absolutely.  A black Republican might have a shot in hell.  Because you would get Democrats defecting to vote over.  Right.  But you are not getting Republicans, no matter how bad they hate...  But look at what happened.  Look at why Bush won the last election. 
[00:30:00]  Because they didn't like Kerry.  Don't be a buzzkill.  And he was as white as they come.  Hey, don't be a buzzkill.  I'm a little excited about this Obama.  You get all excited about it because you'll be gravely disappointed.  You know...  What are you excited about?  It's just fun to say.  Obama!  It's fun but not easy as we go to the news clip.  And here's another reason this guy ain't gonna win.  Well, I mean, I will say this much.  America is dumb in general.  And a lot of people will be saying, I ain't voting for Osama.  You got to play the clip. 
[00:30:30]  All right, here.  Listen to this.  Barack Obama could run for president in 2008 for the first time.  The Illinois senator said he's considering the top job.  Happened yesterday.  Previously, he'd said he would serve out his current six-year term.  On the Sunday morning talk show circuit, Obama said he'll give the idea of running more thought  after next month's election.  See, they're right there.  That's another reason, right there, that people won't vote for him.  She's on the news.  It's written down in front of her on a teleprompter, and she said Osama. 
[00:31:00]  No one's voting for Osama.  Osama.  She can't help it.  She's got big boobs.  Yeah, she does.  Stupid boobs got in the way of the teleprompter.  That's right.  She can't help it.  She has a hole where all the smarts leak out of.  God, we're women hating today.  Oh, I know.  Sorry, girls.  And our women numbers are pretty good lately.  Sorry, ladies.  I was just thinking, though, man, that sideline reporting with the broad, it's got to go. 
[00:31:30]  I can't take it anymore.  Yeah, good luck with your backing of Obama.  Obama, at least I'm not Mickey Rivers black.  Come on.  Google Mickey Rivers.  That's black.  Good luck to you.  This country, you know, you get a little short-sighted living in New York or L.A.  San Francisco.  San Francisco.  There are plenty of cities around this country where you get a little bit caught up in your own surroundings and think, yeah, hey, this, you know, I think this could go over. 
[00:32:00]  Nah.  Fly to L.A. and look down once you pass some of the major cities.  That's the heartland.  Not a lot of buildings, though.  Not a lot of people.  But a lot of people.  Not a lot of people.  There's a lot of farms down there, my friend.  A lot of farmers feeding this country.  What do you think?  What do you think these big cities get the food?  You see a cornfield out the window?  They get it from the country. 
[00:32:30]  And you know what goes on out there?  Lynchings.  Things like that.  Well, if it's not Obama, you tell me who it's going to be.  I don't know because the Democrats are stupid and they don't groom a candidate the second the election's over.  And they lose.  They should groom and all get behind.  They don't have the unity that Republicans have.  Republicans can hate whoever the guy running is.  But they will usually get behind them once that primary's over.  Once they pick who they want to go with. 
[00:33:00]  That's it.  There's support.  Democrats are so splintered and friggin' they can never get together.  Pick a guy that's legitimate.  Doesn't have that stupid carry with his stupid ketchup wife.  Babble in like an idiot that albatross around his neck.  And pick one guy.  One man.  A leader.  Someone with balls.  Yet charismatic.  Like Bill Clinton.  Before he tripped over his own schwance. 
[00:33:30]  Halfway through his turn.  But there was a guy that people could get behind.  It's the message of hope.  That whole thing.  It was ridiculous.  But it put him over.  The guy put him over.  That's the point.  You're selling a person.  Let's not forget he was the first black president.  That's what he says.  But the guy.  The chicks dug him.  So you got to get a guy that the chicks like.  Things like that.  Death penalties for some conservatives.  Right.  You got to be a little, you know, half and half on some of the issues. 
[00:34:00]  That's why I say Obama.  The chicks got to love Obama.  That guy's not half and half on the issues.  Everyone's.  People are going to look at him and go, here we go.  He's left.  He's liberal.  He's it.  Even though, you know, he's not.  And most people will just use the N word.  He's only half black, by the way.  Is he?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's the other half?  I don't know.  Yeah.  That's all that matters to the voting public of this country.  That is all that matters.  I don't know.  Obama versus Mark Foley. 
[00:34:30]  That would be a great thing.  Can you imagine?  Do you think, Obama, I don't know if we can say it on the air, what Obama's slogan might be.  That'll never.  Another Obama slogan?  I think I might have it.  I don't know.  Are they going to beep it?  I don't know.  I don't know if they're going to.  They might.  Well, we're checking down the hall.  Yeah.  Hold on a second.  But I think they might. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  I saw what they were working on, and so far he has a, I may be a ****, but at least  I don't ****.  What the hell?  What?  At least I don't ****.  What happened?  I don't know.  He kind of car crashed.  Yeah.  It's right next to each other, and I was moving my mic back.  All right.  Ready?  Take two.  Yeah.  Hey, I may be a ****, but at least I don't **** kids.  All right, that's another Obama slogan.  My fault. 
[00:35:30]  My Foley machine isn't working well.  Obama, half black, half Asian, 50-50 where it counts.  Mondo election win list.  Look, man.  I was going to vote for Oprah like everybody else.  Let's go to the win, Liz.  I was going to vote for Oprah like everybody else.  Yeah.  Hey, they got another angle on the marathon or falling down.  Oh, no.  This one's even a better angle.  He's close.  It's a, uh.  Look at that.  Look at, oh.  Oh, yeah.  That has to hurt.  Oh, boy.  You know his head is ringing right there. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, boy.  Look at that.  Oh.  This poor bastard.  He wins the marathon, falls on his head.  Madonna takes his son.  Oh.  No justice.  And there has to be a female newscaster.  Everyone, and this is not just with women.  It was racially, too.  They have to have one of everything.  Like, you can't watch the news if you're Asian and there's not an Asian.  Or you can't watch it if you're black and there's not a black woman.  Yeah.  If you're white, there's a white woman.  Because you won't watch.  It's so predictable, man.  The whole world is predictable now. 
[00:36:30]  And they like to sell it as, you know, what?  It's just people.  These are just people.  We don't look, see color or race or anything.  But they do research and know that in a big city that they have to load it up with the  same minorities that are in the city.  Who do you trust?  And that's what it is.  That's what it's about.  It's not about, you know, the best qualified person or, you know, loading it up with white  people or anything like that.  Why are there no fat newscasters?  Like, really?  Occasionally, you get a weatherman.  Occasionally, you get a jolly fat man. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, it's going to be snowing.  Oh, but even that isn't as bad politically correct these days.  So the fat, jolly weatherman is the guy that has to lose the weight now.  Like Al Roker did.  You know, it's more than he could talk about how, you know, healthy he is and things like  that.  So that was like a couple of years ago.  The fat, jolly weatherman.  I want a fat pig of an anchor.  A fat pig.  Because they know no one will watch.  If you're so into diversity and making sure everybody has an equal chance, get somebody 
[00:37:30]  who is, yeah, fat.  A fat pig who's an anchor figuratively and literally.  Get a fat or just somebody that's really unpleasant to look at.  Give me a burn victim.  And get them up there.  Right.  I want a burn victim with a wide-eyed stare and those thin lips doing the news.  Today in other news, it's going to be hot again.  Uh-oh.  That stupid ill-fitting wig askew.  Oh, my God.  It's so obviously a wig.  It looks like a lemon with hair on it. 
[00:38:00]  Very good.  That conjures up an image.  Sure does.  All right.  Hey, who thinks their life is important out there?  I do.  Ant, do you think your life's important?  I think everybody feels.  Jimmy, do you think your life's important?  I do.  Travis, do you think your life's important?  Oh, she said no.  Yeah.  No one's life is that important.  No?  No. 
[00:38:30]  Everyone thinks their life is important.  But the fact is, when you die, they just hose it down and they just move on.  Move on along.  What a great example of your life not meaning crap.  Fayetteville, West Virginia.  Did you hear about this?  They do this every year, by the way.  The base jumpers from that bridge.  Mm-hmm.  The bridge is 876 feet high.  Yeah.  And they've been base jumping off this thing for many, many, many years.  And now they have a festival every year where they come from all over the world just to jump off this bridge. 
[00:39:00]  And they allow this to happen in West Virginia, which that alone amazes me.  Base jumping is what?  It means a bridge, antenna, structure, and earth.  Base jumping.  It's jumping with a parachute.  It's a parachute without a plane.  Oh, it's a parachute.  So you jump off other things.  He's right.  Building.  Yeah.  Buildings.  Aerial.  Antenna.  Okay, right, right, right.  Antennas.  Big, like, you know, towers and stuff.  I think they're a bungee jumping.  Structures.  And, um, or, yeah, bridges. 
[00:39:30]  Bridges.  Aerials.  Wait, now, I...  You had a...  Structures.  Yeah, yeah, it's not building.  It's bridges.  Bridges.  Antennas.  Antennas.  Structures, which are buildings and whatnot.  Okay.  And earth, like rocks and stuff.  Yeah.  You know, the side of a mountain, let's say.  So they do this every year, and, uh, an experienced parachutist who jumped from a bridge to his  death at a popular festival may have deployed his parachute late.  Investigators will continue to examine the fatal incident, but witness accounts, uh, indicate 
[00:40:00]  Brian Lee Schubert's death Saturday was caused by the partial or late deployment of  his chute.  He actually was able to open his chute 25 feet before the ground.  That'll help.  Way, way, way too late.  He was 66 years old, died of injuries.  66?  Suffered when he hit the water 876 feet below the New River George Bridge during the annual  Bridge Day Festival.  So that's very tragic, right?  Is there a video of it?  And you would think, oh, I'm sure there's a ton of video of that, because it's one of  these festivals, they're all out there with their video cameras, they got the cameras 
[00:40:30]  on their helmets and everything.  They don't allow that type of video on YouTube, right?  I don't think so.  That's too bad.  Ogre slavet.  That's too bad.  Anyway, uh...  Ogre slavet.  This, uh, this proves that your life doesn't mean crap.  They continue jumping after he died.  Yeah.  Wow.  He jumps.  He's dead.  Who's next?  Yeah.  Thousands of people attending the festival watched the fatal jump.  Witnesses, uh, witnesses said Schubert's chute didn't open until about, yeah, 25 feet 
[00:41:00]  above the water.  Jumping continued after his body was taken away.  What are the odds two people are going to die?  And that's the first fatality since, uh, 1987 at Bridge Day.  So it's happened before, yeah, but it's been about 20 years.  It draws an estimated 100,000, uh, spectators.  And about 400, uh, parachutists to the southern part of the state.  There you go.  There you go.  Oh.  Your life doesn't mean crap.  They just hose it down. 
[00:41:30]  In this case, they didn't even have to hose it down because they hit the river.  Yeah.  So, you know, blood guts just going downstream, little, little fishy, just eating what they  can.  They grab the body, drag it to the side, and people go, all right, game on.  Let's continue.  25 feet, you think.  Ooh, maybe I, hey, it opened.  Maybe, maybe I'd splat.  Uh, I said, George, it's what, Jorge? 
[00:42:00]  Dave, I don't know.  What is it?  Hey, I love you, man.  Uh, yeah, it's Gorge, not George.  It's what?  Gorge?  Gorge.  Oh, okay, I'm sorry.  Dave in Missouri.  Obama for president, you're right.  Oh, Obama!  Yeah.  Let's go to Joe in Jersey.  Joe.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  I got another, uh, slogan for Obama.  Yeah.  If you didn't already figure, it's time to elect him.  All right.  Jesus.  Come on.  See, this is why I'm, they're proving my point. 
[00:42:30]  My slogan's much better.  They are proving my point.  And it gets the point across.  At least I'm not Mickey Rivers Black.  That's all he needs to tell the people out there.  And he's a sure.  And, and, oh yeah, everyone in the middle of the country are going to go pulling the lever.  That's right.  When we get back, let's talk about Stephen Hawking.  Oh, no.  And his divorce.  And Linda Stassi has a sad column in the paper today.  Well, it's a, it's a movie, a lifetime movie that she's reviewing.  Yeah.  Of course, she reviews, uh, TV and, uh, she reviewed, uh, Jimmy's, uh, Lucky Louie and 
[00:43:00]  gave it quite the lackluster review.  One of Jimmy's favorite reviewers.  Yeah.  Not for the reason you would think.  Hey, uh, the Opie and Anthony Halloween party is brought to you by Saw 3.  If it's Halloween, it must be Saw.  I think we've got a couple of the actors from Saw 3 coming in today.  Shawnee's up on the TV right now.  She's up on the TV right now.  Oh, that's the one coming in today?  Yeah.  What's her name?  Shawnee.  She's lovely.  Shawnee Smith, right?  Yeah.  And Tobin Bell's also coming in today?  I believe. 
[00:43:30]  All right.  And what's going on with the, uh, the Halloween party?  Are we giving out details yet?  What Halloween party?  Oh, Ant, stop it.  Mom's the word.  Why?  I don't know.  I got some really fantastic news.  I don't know if it's true or not about the Halloween party.  Did you?  I don't know if I'm allowed to say it.  Yeah, yeah.  Some good things are going to happen at the Halloween party this year.  I mean, I'm really, I'm really excited.  At least, at least I'm not.  Quiet.  What?  What?  Mickey Rivers? 
[00:44:00]  Well.  Yeah.  Yeah, but that's the celebrity I was thinking of.  No.  Why not?  Obama?  No, forget it.  When can we say it?  Who's going to be the?  I don't know.  We got to figure it all out.  We got to get the details.  I need a one sheet of details about the Halloween party.  Yes.  So we can start talking about our fine Halloween party.  It's like in a week.  Oh, okay.  All right.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Hey, what's up?  It's Louis Twitchell Santani.  Shut up!  Tourette's Day is coming to the Opie and Anthony Show, which is to say that we've discovered 
[00:44:30]  a new excuse to point and laugh at people who are different.

Tourette's been drunk into a new radical disorder that's killed twice by involuntarily sick and  repeated vocalizations.  Exactly.  So if you have Tourette's or if you know somebody with Tourette's, muster up some courage and  an ounce of self-control and get in touch with the Opie and Anthony Show.

[00:46:30]  We have the scale.  All right.  We'll see.  Go ahead.  Sorry, Anthony.  I saw the video.  Somebody sent it over to me of the base jumper that died over the weekend.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, you know, he's only a couple of days old.  Dead.  A couple of days dead.  And his video of his death video, the video of him dying is on zanyvideos.com.  It just.  What is it?  Feature Benny Hill music?  Yeah. 
[00:47:00]  Every video has Benny Hill music.  Does that qualify as zany?  Anything on America's Funniest Home Videos could be zany.  You know, the old golf, teaching the kid to golf and the ball hits the father right between the legs or something like that.  Zany.  The guy jumping to his death.  Zany?  I don't know.  It doesn't seem too zany.  The internet's out of control.  It's just out of control.  You know what's creepy about that video?  They show him jump.  He's just a speck. 
[00:47:30]  A little dot.  On the video.  Until he gets a little closer to the ground, of course.  And then his chute opens.  It comes out, deploys, but doesn't quite open because he's so close to the water.  And then makes a big splash.  Yeah.  And he swans a goner.  Well, at least he died doing something he.  Yeah.  Good.  I'm glad you slapped yourself before that bit of drivel came out.  Died doing something he loved.  Really?  How great is that?  Well, he's at peace. 
[00:48:00]  I just, here, try it, man.  I really hurt myself, man.  There are worse ways.  See what I do for my art, man.  I know.  As much as it's not TV and no one can see it.  I know.  He actually slapped his own face.  Yeah.  I realized, I'm like, I need a slap.  And stupid me, I wasn't thinking that my left hand would have done just fine.  Yeah.  I decided to smack my own face.  You smack your own face.  I needed to wake up a little bit anyway.  Looked like you were doing a skin bracer commercial.  Oh, well.  At least he died doing something he loved.  Really? 
[00:48:30]  I don't think that's what he was thinking.  Oh, at least.  Oh, look at the blue sky.  Well, I know I'm going to die, but I'm doing something I love.  My chute ain't opening, but I love this.  He loves falling.  Yeah.  He loves plummeting.  All right.  Speaking of death, just another selfish human being in this next story.  Oh, boy.  If you're going to kill yourself, do it in the privacy of your own home so you don't affect anybody.  Every year.  What?  Well, every year. 
[00:49:00]  We were just talking about this.  Oh, the jumpers.  Well, because we had the director of The Bridge in on Friday, which he was terrific.  Did you see the movie, Jimmy?  Yeah.  How great is it?  It was really, really interesting, man.  I loved it.  It's twisted.  You know what I want to do?  I think it'd be funny.  I want to find out every one of those guys' names, and I want to put them all on IMDB  and just give them the one credit.  Oh, God.  The Bridge himself.  Oh, gee.  You know, the guy only did one movie.  How good could he be? 
[00:49:30]  Jimmy, what did you like about the movie?  Seriously.  The Bridge himself.  That's great.  I like the fact that the suddenness of a couple of the jumps, the clumsiness of the jumps  was really, it was so not Hollywood, the way they just fall forward and flail their arms  like morons.  Yeah, yeah.  It was creepy, man.  Yeah.  And the families weren't as distraught as you would have thought.  They almost seemed like a lot of them had heard this so many times.  They were so annoyed, and they were so sick of it.  Not that they were relieved, but I don't think they were.  One father knew his son was going to commit suicide. 
[00:50:00]  He had no doubt in his mind.  Like, there's parents out there, they know they have a troubled kid or something, but  they don't really believe that the kid's actually going to kill himself.  This father was convinced his son was going to kill himself, and he also knew there was  nothing else he could do for his own son.  And he was just waiting for the day he was going to get the phone call.  And he tried taking the day off.  Like, hey, we'll spend the day together.  We'll spend the day together.  Oh, that's the one that survived, wasn't it?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, you mean a different guy?  Yeah, the guy that was petting the dog, that creep that said he himself thought he could  be a serial killer in another life or something like that? 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  Very nice.  Yeah, but the parents had that in common in this movie.  They knew their kids were going to kill themselves, and it was just a matter of time.  Someone said in the movie, well, before you kill yourself, can you do me a favor and please  say goodbye?  That's all I want.  That's all I want is for you to call me and say goodbye before you do it.  And there was the one woman who just was awful.  They showed, like, a silhouette of her, and she's talking about, like, how this guy, she  knew he was depressed, and she's like, I realized he wanted to kill himself, and he said he was 
[00:51:00]  so ashamed, and he was, like, really having a breakdown, and he needed her.  I think he was gay, so it wasn't even like he wanted to sleep with her.  And then she's like, he asked me if he could come over, because he was really distraught,  like, just to be here, and I said no.  Oh, good one.  She said no.  She was weird, man.  But call me if you need me.  Was she the one that was giving her pills out to the guy?  Yes.  Yeah, she had her own problem.  She stunk as a friend.  Wow.  And, of course, that was the last time she ever saw him.  So the guy needed to come over to be comforted, because he was in a horrible depression. 
[00:51:30]  He was in a pit, and he maybe thought that this was a rope being lowered.  Yeah.  Instead, this whore dangled it over his face and yanked it away.  Sorry, my programs are on.  You can't come over.  But she had problems.  I saw right through that.  I'm like, this girl is probably, she probably has more problems than the guy that jumped.  What I, the one thing about the film that I just, I think about every day was just when  they were focusing on individuals on the bridge, because they didn't know who was going to  jump.  Obviously, they had a, they set up for a year straight, and they caught 24 people. 
[00:52:00]  So you can imagine how many people they focused in on that weren't jumping.  And when they focused in on the movie on somebody, like, oh, my God, you got that feeling like,  is this going to be one?  And then you had this weird relief when they were just a tourist or a bicyclist or a jogger  just, you know, no, just checking out the bridge and moving on.  But they did show that one jogger.  He jogged.  And he then was on his cell phone laughing.  And they're showing this guy, like, okay, obviously he isn't, he's not going to jump. 
[00:52:30]  And he's one of the jumpers.  All of a sudden, he just jumps over the rail and goes.  I'm like, holy crap.  Wasn't it just a clumsy jump, too?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's the one that kind of stumbled over the top of it.  His one crowning moment, he flubs it.  I love the movie.  You saw the splashes, right?  Yeah, after they jumped.  No, I mean, did you see the far shot of the bridge?  Oh, yeah, when they just showed.  Yeah, yeah.  At first, I didn't know why they were showing that shot over and over again.  And those were the ones that they didn't catch him jumping because, you know, they can't  focus on, what, the bridge is two miles long or something like that? 
[00:53:00]  They don't know, you know.  Yeah, exactly.  You just can't follow everybody.  They didn't get all the things.  So what they did was they had a long shot the whole time so they would catch the splash  in the water.  And that was really creepy to see that from time to time.  Yeah.  Anyway, speaking of suicide.  Is it possible a teenage driver was trying to commit suicide when she slammed her car into oncoming  traffic, killing a mother of three?  Great.  That's the contention of the victim's family.  Mario's wife and his six-year-old daughter were driving on Roswell Road. 
[00:53:30]  She was doing everything right when the other car intentionally, from what we know, went across  the center line and in an effort to commit suicide, hit them.  And now the 16-year-old driver in the accident has been charged with felony murder and aggravated  assault.  He always lived.  Mario's children have lost a mother.  He has lost a wife.  And the message, the message is, this should never have happened. 
[00:54:00]  And this particular individual, as tragic as it may be, should never be allowed to do  this again.  Yeah.  Did anyone notice how that could be the worst reporter voice ever?  Yeah.  Never.  They knew they had to, you know, put the serious voice in.  I mean, he was really, really smug.  They all are horrid newscasters. 
[00:54:30]  And, of course, the driver is sorry, but, you know, if you're going to try to kill yourself,  can you leave us out of it, please?  Every year here in Manhattan, there's near misses because some dope decides to kill himself  by jumping out one of these windows.  Jumping out of a building.  It's only New York City.  And they usually wait.  There's people down there.  They usually wait for lunchtime, you know, because they're that selfish.  Yeah.  Oh, you want to have a bite, too.  Let's say hi to Deanna from California.  Deanna.  Hi, Opie.  Can you just please not tell any more of the best parts of the movie? 
[00:55:00]  No.  I will continue doing that.  Why?  It's not going to be as exciting for us as it was for you.  Sweetheart, it's not a murder mystery.  It's footage of real people killing themselves.  I know.  Where's the cliffhanger?  They look down and they jump.  They splash.  Thank you for sticking out for me, Jimmy.  I really appreciate it.  It's not like you're blowing the ending.  Like, whodunit, Colonel Mustard jumped off the thing with a wrench.  Deanna, are you going to go see the bridge?  Yes, I want to. 
[00:55:30]  Very cool.  At the end of the movie, there's a guy with really long black hair.  He's a rocker.  And he jumps backwards.  There you go.  Nice.  There you go.  That's the end of the movie.  It's very dramatic because everyone else jumped forward.  But this guy got up on the rail, put his arms out like this, and just fell backwards.  Did the nesty plunge?  There you go.  Thanks.  That's what I do now.  Go F yourself.  I was what?  I was kidding?  Well.  We're trying to have some nice discussions here. 
[00:56:00]  I don't think.  I think we just lost a fan there.  Oh, wow.  I think we just lost a fan.  Oh, wow.  Guys, I didn't know what the bridge was about.  I thought it was about dental work.  How about give away the details after everyone has seen the movie?  Uh-huh.  There's plenty of other things in the movie, but, you know, Deanna pushed me today.  I'm sorry.  It's not one of those movies, like Tim said, where there's a story that you're going to blow the ending.  The whole gist of watching the movie is just getting the emotion out of it, of the families and how despondent the people must have been. 
[00:56:30]  You can't describe that.  What, are we going to read scripts of it?  And, you know, that's the movie.  Not the end.  I think it is.  Sixth Sense?  Did the guy call in who tried to kill himself at least?  Yeah.  Oh, you didn't hear what happened?  No.  Oh.  Hey, do we have the clip of the guy?  It just wasn't.  Don't even tell.  E-Rock! 
[00:57:00]  Oh, no.  E-Rock's looking.  Oh, no.  Yeah, see, I don't know.  All right.  See you tomorrow.  See you tomorrow, people.  I heard he was going to call in.  Call me crazy, but I would just assume that would be something we should maybe have in front of us today.  It was a fine highlight.  Don't tell Jimmy what happened.  I want to play for him.  I just heard E-Rock sigh.  Oh, Jesus.  We have it?  Going with 40 scores.  We should be ready in five, four.  Dan, could you get it for the next break?  Thank you.  Oh, he slammed down the mouse. 
[00:57:30]  I think E-Rock's pissed.  What's the matter, sweetie pie?  What's the matter, E-Rock?  Nothing's working.  Nothing's working.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, gee.  Rob and DC, what's up?  Hey, fellas.  Oh, the headphones came off.  Hey, my old lady read about that girl that tried to commit suicide,  and she told me that the papers were reporting that she was distraught  over the fact that she couldn't sleep with another girl,  and that's the person she was talking to on the phone. 
[00:58:00]  She was doing like a countdown, almost like a threat, if you will.  Oh.  What, as she was driving?  Yeah.  She wanted to have sex with another girl?  Was she talking to the girl who she wanted to hook up with?  I have no idea, Jimmy.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, you know how the news is.  Yeah.  Just enough details to, yeah, get you salivating.  All right, thank you, sir.  Hey, no problem.  Well, they're going to get that clip, so why don't we get into the Stephen Hawking. 
[00:58:30]  Where's the Stephen Hawking story in front of you?  Such a great, brilliant guy whose body has just walked away from him.  Just such a...  What was the...  Let me see his book.  Oh, my God.  The Brief History of Time.  It's time for Hawking to Divorce.  Divorce.  It's his second wife.  And they put time in, like, quotation marks.  How the hell did he get one?  I don't know.  It's his second wife?  Yeah.  You know, guys.  I don't know what I'm saying.  Elaine, who stole him away from his first life 11 years ago. 
[00:59:00]  Well, you know, guys, beauty is skin deep.  Yeah.  Is it?  Genius for the turnip root body.  It's really awful.  He's 64, married his nurse, Elaine, 55, in 1995, after dumping Jane Hawking, his wife of 26 years and mother of three children.  Wait, he dumped his first wife?  He seems to be in no position to be dumping anything.  Anyway, the news comes amid reports that Hawking, who's been paralyzed by Lou Gehrig's disease, may have been having an affair. 
[00:59:30]  Now, how?  Man, if you can't keep tabs on Stephen Hawking, how dumb are you?  Oh, that's.  What the hell?  See, that's how I read it.  Is that lipstick on your blow tube?  Well, what do they consider an affair when you're that much of a mess?  He pecked someone on the cheek?  He can't really do that.  He blinked.  He blinked at the wrong girl. 
[01:00:00]  No, I was just trying to tell everyone the earth is doomed.  I wasn't flirting.  Wow, that is really, what's going on?  What's this guy's mobility?  I thought he was just completely, completely done.  In the wheelchair, his head slumps over to the side.  How is he cheating?  But his brain works.  How does he do all those calculations without his stupid fingers?  Does he have someone that writes it down or something? 
[01:00:30]  You can't even say the words.  The number's fast enough.  But it's one of those, you know.  Space is a flowing, continuous.  Write it down, idiot.  Could you write this, stupid?  This is good stuff.  I, you are so hot.  I love to, I would love to squeeze your, your, your.  Somehow my computer screws up when trying to say dirty words. 
[01:01:00]  I want to eat your food now.  The computer doesn't recognize the words at all.  Right, right.  So now he wants to eat her pudding.  Thank you.  I want to see your can't.  I want to see your can't. 
[01:01:30]  But he was having the affair.  Please suck my piano.  He was having the affair, yeah.  Oh, wow.  Put your tongue in my gas can.  You, me, Betsy.  We'll go crazy, get some cocaine. 
[01:02:00]  The hookers, me, you, and Betsy.  Wow.  Who knew he had it in him?  Maybe he can make a girl, like, finish just talking.  Maybe he's like that.  Just, like, he's real smooth.  He's got nothing else to offer physically.  This is what I say.  To a girl.  Can we just get him prostitutes?  Whatever it takes.  We've got to keep Stephen Hawking happy.  Because I don't want to know what he knows. 
[01:02:30]  I don't want to know.  He might get to the point he's freaking so miserable through this divorce thing.  He's going to tell us stuff that we really don't want to know about.  There are 18 months left in the earth's history before it implodes.  I was going to keep this knowledge to myself, but.  I was happy, but screw that bitch.  Right.  Now we all suffer.  Really.  Just keep the guy happy.  She can have all of my money.  Ten.  Nine.  Eight.  Seven. 
[01:03:00]  What's he counting down to?  I don't know.  Let's go to Greg on Long Island.  Greg.  Hawking's days are numbered.  Hawking, his days are numbered there?  His divorce.  Everyone is sending in their Pat O'Brien lines for Stephen Hawking.  He talks dirty to a girl, but he's not good at it.  He just talks until she falls asleep, forgetting she was horny to begin with.  I'm going to.  All right.  I get it.  Yeah, what could he do?  I don't know.  I hope we get more.  I hope we get more from this story. 
[01:03:30]  Did you read Caesar on line two?  Let's say hi to Caesar in New York.  Caesar.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  When you guys say that the second wife stole him away from the first one, did she literally  just roll him away?  Stop, thief.  Stop, thief.  All right.  She's stealing me.  Let's go to Kramer in Pittsburgh.  Genius.  Kramer.  Hey.  Last night, there was a Stephen Hawking special on the Science Channel, and it showed that  his mobility is he can't even type to make his words anymore. 
[01:04:00]  He can only communicate by moving his mouth a little bit to the side.  See?  That's all he does.  And then interprets everything he's going to say next.  So he can't even do the...  Hello.  How are you today?  Well, I think his computer talks for him, right?  Yeah, but he's got to type it in.  And this guy's saying, like...  Well, someone else is doing the typing.  He can't even move anymore.  Maybe this wife of his is very vindictive.  Aw.  And just, you know, making all sorts of claims.  I have a small one. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, right.  Can you imagine?  The wife is...  I mean, he just...  He says this all the time.  I'll get you.  My wife is responsible for everything I do.  Please give her all of my money.  All I wanted was flowers for my birthday.  Well, I'll show you, Stephen.  Space is for faggots.  All I want to do is to go out to dinner once in my miserable life.  Well, let me type this into your computer. 
[01:05:00]  You'd see that he was being spoon-fed by his wife the whole time.  This is where we need Dr. Kaku.  Yes.  My idol.  What do we need to call him?  Wow.  Get that one wrong.  See, we just didn't come up with the line in this bit, but I think Coke Logic.  Yeah.  Coke Logic.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Hey, Stephen Hawking left his wife for black holes.  Oh, really?  Maybe that's it.  Who knows?  Some people fall in love with their work. 
[01:05:30]  He's a fan of...  He's done a lot of work on black holes and other things in space.  Of course.  He's a fan of the black hole.  Yeah.  He really thought all these years he was talking about space.  Turns out he's a dummy.  He's just a perv.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  We've got Bill Burr stopping by to say hi.  He's promoting something today.  I don't know what, actually.  Or he might be just coming in to say hi, which is just as good.  He's a good egg.  And we've got a girl for the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest, Stephen. 
[01:06:00]  Sure do.  Is she a biggin'?  Oh, is she ever.  Wow.  Is she going to be the leader, you think?  Yeah.  A lot of potential.  You think she's going to beat out Crystal?  I think so.  She's heavier than 430 pounds.  She certainly looks it.  She's girthy.  All right.  We'll find out next.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Jim Norton will be appearing on The Late Show with David Letterman Wednesday, November 1st.  Check local listings for showtimes.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[01:06:30]  We're back with the O.B. and Anthony Show.  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  Bill Barron's studio.  What was the first thing you heard as you walked in today?  The second I walked in, I'm like half asleep.  They let me in through security.  And the first thing I hear coming from this show is you going,  Oh, just kill yourself.  It's uplifting.  It's just a normal day on the show.  Yeah.  I've been very positive today, Bill.  I don't have headphones.  Your pats looked good yesterday there, Bill.  Did they? 
[01:07:00]  I actually...  You're not following the pats this year?  I just...  I just...  I stayed out till like 4 in the morning the night before, so I just...  So you slept all day yesterday?  Yeah.  Football picks, yes.  If you don't know the deal by now,  the gang behind the scenes and myself,  we're picking games every week.  And the winner for the whole season will win $10,000,  courtesy of Dish Network.  More football for you.  Better TV for all.  Call 1-888-GET-DISH.  And I was 4 for 5 this week. 
[01:07:30]  Actually, Bob Kelly did my picks.  But he picked my Jets.  He picked the pats.  The only game I didn't get was the Steelers.  They lost in overtime.  That was a really, really good game.  Or I would have been 5 for 5.  Yeah, Ben got crunched.  He got...  That guy's having the worst year of his life.  Yeah, he...  Motorcycle accident, appendix.  A pretty bad concussion.  That's right, the appendix, too.  I forgot about that.  Jesus.  Yeah, real bad concussion for him yesterday.  Steve went 5 for 5 this week.  E-Rock went 5 for 5.  Really? 
[01:08:00]  I went 4 for 5.  And Travis went 4 for 5.  You picking winners or against the spread?  Just no spread, nothing.  Just winners.  But I'm doing...  How could you lose?  Jeez.  Yeah.  But I'm not really...  I'm picking my...  It's 5 for 5.  I was really impressed for half a second.  But I'm picking games out of the hat some weeks.  And I'm still in it.  I'm in second place with 18, correct?  Steve's running away with it right now with 22, correct?  Of course.  So Steve's the leader for the $10,000 courtesy of Dish Network.  There you go.  All right. 
[01:08:30]  You know Steve is trying not to think of what he's going to do with the money if he wins it?  Oh, my God.  He really doesn't like football because it's kind of a masculine sport.  He doesn't really enjoy it.  It's a manly.  Yeah, it's not his thing.  I just think he doesn't want to be so disappointed when right at the end somebody else pulls it out and pulls the rug out from under his feet.  I've never heard Steve talk about football in my life.  No, he doesn't.  I think he's got a little somebody doing his picks for him.  He does.  You think?  Oh, yeah.  He'd be smart to then.  We've been working with Steve for, what, over eight years now? 
[01:09:00]  I've never heard him talk football.  Not a word.  Not one time.  I couldn't even tell you.  Steve, you don't know football.  Not a thing.  The only thing he knows about football is that he envies the position of the center.  Thank you, Jim.  You're in the lead and you don't know football?  I used to play football when I was in high school.  But other than that, I don't really know much about, like, specifics.  Who's doing your picks?  Be honest.  Me.  And it takes me roughly 15 seconds to do them.  You're not getting any help from anybody.  I thought about that and then I realized that I'd have to split the money if I did that. 
[01:09:30]  So I said, so it takes me 15 seconds.  15 seconds after Travis sends me the names of the teams, I do my picks and I do whatever.  You're running away with it.  Evidently.  But you know what?  Travis says I have to keep this going for 10 more weeks.  I don't think I got it.  I don't think I have 10 more weeks in me.  Get it.  Because then I'd actually have to know something.  All right.  I'm four behind you.  I'm tied for second with a couple of the guys.  Do you have any team loyalty?  None.  Yeah.  Who's your favorite team?  I don't have one.  Name one football player.  The Calgary Flames.  Couldn't tell you.  You couldn't name one football player?  Well, I know, like, Terrell Owens and, like, the people that are in the papers and stuff like that. 
[01:10:00]  All right.  Who does Terrell Owens play for?  Eagles.  Faggot.  Does he?  Oh, my God.  No, he doesn't.  Oh, my God.  And he's winning the whole thing.  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  That's what I was saying, though.  Oh, my God.  This goes to show you.  Who's Terrell Owens' coach?  No idea.  Oh, my God.  Watch.  I'm going to get my phone.  He's going to go off with text calling me an idiot right now.  Creep.  Terrell Owens plays for the Eagles.  You got that much right.  Yes.  Wow.  You didn't know that Buddy Ryan was his coach?  No.  Is that true?  Yes. 
[01:10:30]  Terrell was traded to the...  Oh, my God.  And he's winning the whole thing.  That's right.  Here's how you help him.  The team he was traded to, it's the same guy you like in the Village People.  Oh, the Cowboys.  My God.  I knew that one.  See, I knew it.  I knew you had no clue about football.  No idea.  You had the whole thing.  All right.  You might win $10,000.  All right.  What would you do with the money?  House repairs.  Really?  More house repairs?  I thought you went through that. 
[01:11:00]  It's a nightmare.  Everything's just falling apart.  All right.  Thank you, Dish Network, for giving us the $10,000.  Where's the fatty?  I mean, where's the contestant?  It's time for Fatty Pig Fatty.  Bring her in.  Bring her in, yes.  You know the deal, Bill?  $10 a pound?  Heaviest woman to come through that door?  Oh, yeah.  Last time I was here, there was some big one looking at the ground all embarrassed.  Current leader's 430 pounds.  It is a great contest.  That's what I'm saying.  It's a terrific contest. 
[01:11:30]  Plus, there's a finder's fee now.  Yep.  So, if you bag some big game, you get $1,000.  Wow.  You've got to have somebody wear a wire trying to pick up that girl.  Exactly.  Wouldn't you just find...  We have a new leader.  Wow.  She doesn't even have to get on this scale.  We have a big girl.  No, don't step on there yet.  Don't step on that scale.  Oh, my God.  Let me just congratulate you right now.  Right now.  We have a big girl.  Ladies and gentlemen, Mike Singletary. 
[01:12:00]  Wow.  Wow, wow, wow.  You are a lot of woman.  You are a lot of woman.  We talked to you on the phone, right?  Yeah.  What's your name again?  Honey.  Honey.  You are Honey.  Mm-hmm.  You're a lot of Honey.  You are a big girl.  Wow.  And, I mean, you're, like, big all over.  Yeah.  You've got big breasts.  Looks like you're wearing a football uniform.  Yeah, big girl.  You've been a big girl all your life? 
[01:12:30]  No.  No?  Mm-mm.  What happened?  What happened?  Life.  Life?  Life.  Life got you.  And you just said, screw it.  I'm eating.  I'm eating.  I'm eating.  What do you mean by life, though?  Just difficulties.  Yeah?  Yeah.  With a man, or?  Hell no.  No?  Never been a problem.  No.  Do you drink, or do you have any other vices, or is it just food?  Say that again.  Do you drink?  Like, do you have other vices, or is it just eating?  It was eating.  Eating.  Yeah, it's pretty good stuff.  For me, it was alcohol and drugs, and then I got rid of them, and now it's prostitution. 
[01:13:00]  So.  Yeah, so, you know.  But, you know, it keeps the weight off.  Jim understands.  Keeps the weight off of them.  Are you wearing a bra?  Yeah, why?  You got nice.  She's going to go after me.  Very large breasts.  What do you like to, uh...  I just want to acknowledge that you got really big boobs.  Thank you.  What do you like to eat?  Anything?  A little bit of this.  A little bit of... 
[01:13:30]  Like, Scott, but what, like, you like, like, um, a lot of regular type food, or is it snacks?  No, it's regular food.  I don't like that.  Regular food?  Like, you could down an entire turkey in one sitting, or?  Turkey's dry.  I like flaila.  Like, but, but, like, you could have...  KFC.  Like, three...  No, not KFC.  Three pizzas.  No pizza.  No?  Like, like...  What do you like?  Caribbean food, Spanish food.  Yeah?  Yeah.  So, stuff like that.  Mm-hmm.  Nice jerk chicken sandwich or something.  Mm-hmm.  A couple of those. 
[01:14:00]  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, those are good.  What's, what part...  That is good stuff.  What's the worst part about being so big?  Like, traveling, or other people looking at you?  Traveling.  I don't care about people looking at me.  Okay.  I don't mind that at all.  They gotta look when I'm at heart.  But, uh, just traveling.  Pretty much.  Yeah.  People trying me.  You know.  I don't know.  Do they?  Yeah.  What do you mean?  Do they step up and...  They underestimate my power.  ...get in your face?  Yeah.  Sometimes they try to get smart.  You know.  Yeah, I know.  I can see it in your eye. 
[01:14:30]  I can see it in your eye.  So do you...  She takes care of herself.  Do you have trouble getting into a regular car?  No, I have a regular car.  You have a regular car?  Mm-hmm.  And who's your posse?  Who's who over there?  That's the crew.  That's the crew?  Yeah.  Who's the fan of the show?  Because you don't know about...  You don't know our show, right?  No, not at all.  Honey, you never listened to us?  You guys are from Binghamton?  Is this the Binghamton crew?  Yes.  What's your name, bro?  Bob.  Hey, Bob.  Hi, Bob.  Hey there, Bab.  And how do you know Honey?  Honey's a friend of mine.  Yeah?  Worked together, or...?  Just friendship.  We met and kind of went from there and developed a friendship. 
[01:15:00]  How'd you guys meet?  We met through an apartment.  She was coming up looking, relocating to Binghamton.  I helped her find a place and developed a friendship from there.  Is it more than friends?  No.  Or was it ever more than friends?  No, it wasn't.  Oh, you guys are more than friends?  That's my wife.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh, man, this guy's going to kill me, man.  Damn.  Why, you haven't been...  I was good...  I was...  It's all entertainment.  How long have you guys been married? 
[01:15:30]  About a year and two months.  Yeah, right on.  A year and two months.  Now, she was a big girl in your bed.  Oh, yeah.  You always liked big girls?  Not really, but it was just something about...  Oh, she's giving you a little luck.  It's something about her personality that's just drawing me to her.  Yeah.  And what does...  Honey, what do you do for a living?  Right now, I'm raising my son.  Before then, I was into mental health.  Mental health?  Mm-hmm.  Very cool.  And what do you do for a living, sir?  Right now, I'm in school. 
[01:16:00]  I have no luck because I'm just a student.  Okay.  And are you a fan of the show, or you have no clue, too?  I didn't have no clue until my man Bob told me about it.  Bob.  So, who gets the $1,000 for bringing Honey in if she wins the contest?  I do, Bob.  That goes to Bob.  Bob gets the finder's fee of $1,000.  Yep.  How did you bring up the show to them?  I just explained the contest to her, and she jumped on it from there, said, I want to do it.  I'll win this contest.  I'm going to take the money and run with it. 
[01:16:30]  You just saw Cha-ching.  And who's the guy in the hat in the back of the Yankee hat?  Who's that nervous-looking wreck with the sweater?  I'm the one that spread the virus to my friend, Bob.  Oh, you turned it on.  Ah, there you go.  He's been on the show since the beginning, XM.  Very good, sir.  So, you were a fan, you turned Bob onto it, and now Bob found Honey.  Yep, correct.  See how this virus thing works?  That's pretty cool.  It does.  It's exactly the way it spreads.  Well, the current leader of Fatty Pig Fatty is 430 pounds.  That's Crystal in Cleveland. 
[01:17:00]  We have a scale.  Crystal, if you're listening, my apologies.  It's been fun, Cleveland.  It's been, yeah, very fun.  It's over.  We got the new leader right here in New York today.  That is so over.  Her name is Honey.  What are you guessing?  What are you guessing?  She's, I think she's going to beat it by 100 pounds.  I don't know.  I think she beats Crystal by 100 pounds.  Remember, here's the deal.  It's $10 a pound.  So, if you win the contest, you know, it's $10 per pound that we see on that scale today, 
[01:17:30]  plus the $1,000 finder's fee to Bob.  Thanks to H57.com.  Who do you fit in?  I'm guessing, I'm guessing 510.  I'm guessing 511.  Son of a bitch.  Don't pull that one point.  Price is right.  Crap with me.  What do you want to do with the money, Anthony?  $480.  Yeah, what are you going to do with the money?  Have fun.  Have fun?  Just have a little fun.  See, she told us how much she weighed on the phone.  I don't remember.  Yeah, but a lot of times people don't.  I don't care.  Let's do it. 
[01:18:00]  All right, let's just do it.  She just wants us over without help.  Yeah.  All right, honey.  Yeah.  All right, let's do it.  Here's honey on the scale.  Come on.  For Fatty Pigs Fatty.  Is it on?  Yeah.  You got a faulty scale.  Jesus.  All right, we're getting the scale.  We're setting the scale.  Where'd you get that scale?  We're officially weighing honey.  All right, let her rip.  Fatty Pigs Fatty.  There we go.  Video's being taken.  Pictures are being taken.  She's on the scale.  She's waiting.  She's holding her husband's hand for support. 
[01:18:30]  Here we go.  It's calculating.  It's still calculating?  It's calculating.  Huh?  Shut up.  They did the same thing with me and Anthony the other time.  Yeah, it takes a while.  All right.  It's calculating.  It's like a computer chip in there.  It's still running through its process.  State-of-the-art game.  She's moving a little bit.  There it is.  Oh, okay.  What is it?  5.05.8.  And you were still right. 
[01:19:00]  5.05.8.  It's over $5,000.  Wow.  On the phone, I think last week, you said 541, right?  Two months ago.  That was two months ago?  Wow.  So you're doing a little dieting?  Kind of, sort of.  Kind of, sort of?  Yeah, holidays are coming up, you know.  Not really got to be chilling.  Well, goddamn, congratulations.  You are now in the lead.  Holy Jesus.  We have a new leader in the Fatty Pig Fatty contest.  Crystal.  Grabbed a 500-pound barrier.  So long, Crystal.  Honey, 505 pounds from Binghamton, New York. 
[01:19:30]  Does it, now when you, do you weigh yourself a lot or when you get on, is that something  that you try to, I mean, say, well, I can't see past my breasts, so y'all had to be  telling me.  Yeah, true.  But is it weird to actually hear it like that or no?  No, it's not weird.  I mean, when you dealt with it, I'm not sensitive about it.  I'm over that.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, but you still get around, man.  Looks like you can move.  A little bit.  Yeah.  Do you want to lose it?  Yeah.  You do?  Yeah.  Do you get surgery?  Hell no. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, no?  No, negative.  Negative?  You could try the Hootia, the Hootia 57, not to give them a, you know, a plug, but they,  Oh, you just did?  Yeah, I guess I did.  You can lose weight with that stuff.  Okay.  All right.  Yeah.  Well, have fun with that money because I think you're going to win.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  I don't think anyone beats five.  What was it?  505?  505.  So that's $5,050, I guess, and then $1,000 for Bob.  We might have just gave away $6,000 today.  A little more. 
[01:20:30]  When's the contest over?  It's over.  Could have.  Halloween.  Wow.  We got about a week left in the contest.  Good luck beating that.  There's a couple of girls that are still thinking of coming in.  I don't know if they're at 505.  I don't know.  They're on their way to White Castle right now.  Yeah, trying to bulk up a little.  Trying to add a couple of pounds.  All right.  Well, good luck.  Nice meeting you.  Bye, honey.  Honey, thank you so much.  I think that'll hold up, but we'll see.  We'll see.  Bob, thank you. 
[01:21:00]  Thanks for popping by.  Bye, guys.  Thanks for introducing them to the show.  Thanks, husband.  What's your name again?  Joe.  Joe.  Thank you, Joe.  Joe.  You guys drove all the way from Binghamton for this, right?  Yep.  Going back now?  No.  Eh, no.  Hang out in the city for the day?  Hang out in the city.  Hey, you should.  All right.  I got to go out to eat.  There you go.  I got to go out to eat.  All right.  Yeah.  I mean, do we have anything we could give them if they're going to be in New York?  We got Burger King certificates.  You can't give them Burger King coupons.  Because we give those to homeless people.  See if Tom has something for them.  They drove all the way from Binghamton. 
[01:21:30]  They got to have something for the people.  Yeah.  Just see if Tom has anything.  There's got to be something.  All right.  Thank you so much, guys.  Honey.  Hi, guys.  Thanks a lot.  Joe, Bob, and who's the dude?  Jamie.  And Jamie.  Thank you, Jamie.  You guys want to say hi to anyone in Binghamton?  Nobody.  Nobody?  Honey yells nobody.  Stacey?  All right.  How's that?  Hi to my friend Tom and my friend Stacey.  All right.  I'm going to say hi to my wife.  And she wanted to come down.  Couldn't get off of work.  She wanted.  Yeah.  Bob, how did you talk her into coming in? 
[01:22:00]  I just mentioned the contest to her and explained to her the prize amount.  No, no, no.  You're making it sound too easy.  You're making it sound too easy.  I can tell that she has no desire to be in this studio right now.  You ought to work up.  She had a lot more ambition until coming into here.  I think she's kind of nervous.  But she said nobody her size is going to have the confidence to step on the scale.  And she's taking it to the bank.  She feels she's going to win it.  She's like a politician.  Yeah.  What did you say?  I mean, that must have been an awkward conversation.  I mean, I just.  Hey, honey. 
[01:22:30]  I just talk to her all the time and joke around.  And I said, hey, there's this contest on a radio show.  And she wasn't familiar with who you guys were.  What's the contest called?  Fanny Pig Fatty.  I explained that to her after I got her hooked on the $5,000, what the name of the contest is.  Yeah, yeah.  All of that.  And then he explained, it's just the name.  They got to give it a wacky name.  He buried that in the middle of a really long sentence.  Yeah.  Right, right.  That was surrounded by a lot of dollar value.  Fanny Pig Fatty.  And you can get a car and everything.  $5,000. 
[01:23:00]  All right.  Thanks, Bob.  All right, gents.  Thanks, guys.  Enjoy New York, all right?  See you later.  Thanks, guys.  Have fun out there.  All right.  Don't talk to anybody.  You get mugged.  Yeah.  That's how it works.  It's not Binghamton out there.  It's a cold, heartless city.  She just won it over with, man.  There was.  Well, people don't know if we're going to be vicious.  There was no playing there.  Wow.  She gave the look of death.  Yeah, it was real awkward.  No, no.  That was one of those deals.  Yeah, line one is going to say something.  Let's go to Bob and Queen.  Bob? 
[01:23:30]  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  Long-time listeners at the debacle in Buffalo.  Yeah.  Listen, this contest has to go.  Why?  It's enough.  It's done.  You guys keep talking up like it's the coolest thing.  Oh, we're going to get some fat chick and just humiliate her and put on a pig mask.  And you get on, you guys pussy out when you see her husband.  It's not the husband, dude.  We don't care about the husband.  We have Kenny here.  It's just when you see somebody, it's hard to humiliate somebody or be a dick to somebody.  I don't know.  It's fun in theory to be a creep.  She's being cool.  She's being nice. 
[01:24:00]  It's like she's a person.  I don't know.  I know what we have to do.  We have to have them walk down the street outside the studio.  Then we can yell at them.  Hey, man.  Some of the contestants have been great.  Like Rhonda was a lot of fun.  Some of the girls up in Cleveland were a lot of fun.  But I could tell Honey did not want to play.  And we needed to get her on the scale to get a new leader in the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest.  Now we're up to 505 pounds.  Ladies, you've got to beat that now.  Yeah, but fair enough.  I mean, but then just don't talk it up like it's going to be the coolest thing.  Bob, the contest has been cool, first of all. 
[01:24:30]  Second of all, I'm more than willing to say yes, I pushed out.  She was intimidating.  Absolutely.  I looked at her.  I was playing with her a little bit.  I'm like, man, this girl is going to do something to me, like smother me or something.  So I backed off.  Yes, you're absolutely right, Bob.  I put 8,000 jokes flashing in my head during that interview.  But the next girl that comes in, you know, we might just go right at her.  I don't know.  That's the beauty of this show.  You don't know what you're going to get.  Fair enough.  All right.  It's a quarter ton. 
[01:25:00]  You're done.  You got the winner.  Thank you, Bob.  We will see.  I admit it is hard to blast somebody like that when they're being nice.  It's really hard just to be a complete dick to somebody who comes in because that's really  hard for someone to do.  That's your worst.  I don't care how confident you think you are.  That's your worst fear is just being made fun of for that.  Yeah.  Even if you have a tough outer shell, it still hurts.  Well, she's the new leader.  That's all we care about. 
[01:25:30]  Update the promo.  That was my insight, which is non-existent.  Honey's the new leader.  It's all right.  Even if you have a tough outer shell, it hurts.  Jimmy asked us about the guy that jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge and survived from  the movie The Bridge.  They interviewed the guy.  Well, he called our show on Friday when the director of The Bridge was in here.  And this is how it went down.  What was going on in your life that drove you to that point?  Quite simply, I have a brain disease called bipolar disorder.  My neuroepinephrine levels, my epinephrine levels, my serotonin levels are out of whack. 
[01:26:00]  I was hearing voices, seeing things, telling me I had to die.  I was in a great deal of emotional and physical pain because of my bipolar.  And I subsequently walked onto the bridge, stood there for 40 minutes, crying my eyes out,  begging myself not to jump while the bipolar was begging me to jump.  And I jumped.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  That's just wrong.  You had to hit that.  What happened?  My hands are on the chair. 
[01:26:30]  That's what happened, Jimmy.  That's exactly what happened.  Had he hung up?  No, he actually hung in there.  He turned out to be really, really cool, the guy.  We didn't know what was going to happen after that.  There you go.  For that dope from Queens that just called.  By the way, the guy who...  You've got to pick your spots.  The guy who jumped, the chilling part for me was when he had said that right...  He said as soon as his feet left the bridge, he wanted to live.  Yeah.  So you know that most of them go through that. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah, where it's like, uh-oh.  No getting back on the bridge.  Yeah, you just got to hope for the best.  What do you do?  Flail around, try to land feet first.  Do that panic running in the air?  Yeah, that ain't going to save you.  All four limbs just...  You're not a cartoon.  Right.  Guy jumped backwards, man.  All right, we got a couple actors from Saw 3 waiting in the green room.  We'll talk to them next.  Bill Burr in studio.  Bill, promoting anything?  Yeah, I'm doing Comics Come Home up at BU this Saturday. 
[01:27:30]  Very nice.  Who's on that with you?  It's Leary Hoseley.  Leary, I think Patrice, he was on it last year.  I haven't even looked at the lineup, but every year they get...  Every year it's a great, great bill, man.  Great bill up there in Boston.  We've gone many, many, many times.  It's sold out yet or no?  It will be.  I think it is.  Or if it isn't, it's real close.  Of course it is.  You don't even have to promote it.  The fact is you'll be at Comics Come Home.  It's for Chowry, right?  Yeah, for the Cam Neely house.  Yeah, all right.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America. 
[01:28:00]  I can walk on my hands.  I can fart and chew gum.  I play the over.  I can ride a unicycle.  I wear a bra and laced panties.  Panties.  So your talent is being queer, Travis?  It's the O.P. and Anthony Walkover Talent Show.  If you have a unique skill, talent, music group, or physical affliction, we want to exploit.  You can email Steve at foundrymusic.com with your ideas, or you can just show up during the walk to XM and start shucking and jiving.  Shucking and jiving?  Jesus, Danny. 
[01:28:30]  I don't write this sh**.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  ONA uncut and live.  Continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The virus is spreading.  O.P. and Anthony!  Yeah, we're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  We just spent that commercial break discussing what we would have said to Honey, the new leader in the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest. 
[01:29:00]  We're a bunch of wimps.  Yeah.  Wait a minute, she intimidated everybody.  She intimidated us, and then we just kind of folded.  Anthony basically said that if she was 505 pounds and white...  And didn't have her boyfriend with her.  And didn't have her boyfriend with her, or her husband, whatever, you would have went right at her.  Yeah.  We're too suburban and stupid.  You just watched the Jerry Springer show too many times. 
[01:29:30]  You just pictured her running full speed.  You were the closest...  Yeah, I know.  I was a little scared of that, too.  I was like the closest target, so...  She had a look.  You know what?  I'm a pile-on guy, too.  I never started, but once it gets going, then I...  Yeah, I know you, Billy.  You just pile on.  You're on point.  You're on...  I was on point.  I held up the tubes.  Yeah, you were Charlie Sheen.  You were supposed to be hitting the Claymore's, and you didn't.  So we're going to acknowledge that we pushed out on that one?  Yeah, we wimped out.  She had a look in her eye.  I was just like, I don't know, man.  Yeah.  I was thinking, like, she's the leader of a gang or something. 
[01:30:00]  I was scared.  Gang.  Huh?  A gang.  I think she was part of the bloods.  Part of the sweats.  Oh, now you're going to start.  Now I'll start.  Dude, you can't.  You can't.  You can't.  All right.  Okay.  You can't, man.  I take that back.  You're going to sound wimpier.  We should explain to Tobin and Shawnee what we...  We're doing this contest.  It's Fatty Pig Fatty.  Huh?  I'm trying to connect the dots.  It's not a pretty picture.  No, it's not.  It's a contest where we just want to give away money. 
[01:30:30]  We have a lot of money.  We like to give it away.  So nice of you.  I love when Ann tries to explain something in a nice way.  First of all...  We really want to...  Wait.  We really want to give away money?  Do we care about giving away money?  What a liar.  We want to humiliate someone and we needed cash to motivate them to show up.  First of all...  We don't care about the money part of this.  Now Shawnee's sitting here, so I'm completely intimidated.  Yeah, because we also have a problem talking to beautiful women, so...  We got lots of problems with this radio show.  I've pretty much seen everything she's done.  I've been a huge fan. 
[01:31:00]  You don't pop on...  You must be a freak.  I am.  You don't pop on the screen once where I don't go, oh, it's Julie Lowry.  Oh, it's Julie Lowry.  It's always Julie Lowry.  Coming through the tunnel, right?  I was thinking of her.  A little scary.  And then...  So I'm all intimidated and I'm trying to explain it and not look like a bad guy.  Well, why don't you explain it in Anthony's way?  We love giving away huge sums of money.  So we figured we'd give it away to somebody who might not have the ability to go out and have 
[01:31:30]  a good time on their own.  And this country does have a problem with obesity and we do realize this.  So we're doing a contest.  We're paying women that are overweight $10 a pound for their weight.  So the last woman that came in was 505 pounds.  So that's like over $5,000.  Shawnee, we're looking for messes.  And we're looking to...  You're so generous.  Thank you.  We're looking for messes. 
[01:32:00]  The messier, the better.  And we want to humiliate them in front of their faces.  But Anthony's not willing to tell you that.  Did we humiliate anybody, Anthony?  I thought you guys were, you know, like...  It's $10 a pound contest.  I'm feeling very...  No, wait, wait, wait.  Anthony, tell Shawnee what the name of the contest is.  It's the $10...  Mr. Nice Guy.  It's the $10 pound contest.  It's the $10 pound contest.  Come on.  I want Anthony to say it.  He's all frozen, right?  I can't say it.  Just say it.  Say it.  Shawnee, he'll listen to you.  Go, Anthony.  We have to look at it, though.  Go, Anthony.  What's the name of the contest? 
[01:32:30]  Anthony, look me in the eyes and say the name.  It's called the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest.  You should be ashamed.  I know.  I'm going to call your mother.  This is awful.  You go over in that corner.  You're having a timeout.  I should just...  Anthony is red.  Yeah, he really is.  He lost his position on point.  Sometimes I get very embarrassed.  You guys lost Tobin about 30 seconds ago.  I get all embarrassed of this program sometimes for what I do for a living. 
[01:33:00]  This show is a disaster.  I really get embarrassed of what I do for a living.  You're getting shy in front of the beautiful girl here, Shawnee.  You couldn't say what you really want to say to Honey.  All right, what's the most noble thing you've ever done on this radio show?  Noble?  I don't think it's ever even been spoken.  No?  It's so noble that I've kept it to myself.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  You're noble on the inside.  Yeah.  I got to be noble off the air because if I just was like this...  People don't buy noble?  They won't tune in for that? 
[01:33:30]  No.  Well...  For some reason they don't.  You know what happens?  We got Bill Burr in the studio, a fine comedian.  And Bill walks down the street with Anthony after the show.  And all he does is bitch and complain about...  Do you think what we did was like...  Wasn't that a little over the top today?  I kind of felt bad when this...  You know, like, Bill, if you keep talking, I'm not going to be able to sleep tonight.  So shut up.  You know, Anthony, all your renegade points went out the window this morning.  I saw it.  I saw it.  What?  You were totally pussed out.  Yeah, you've had a tough 15 minutes.  I'm not saying I didn't.  Who's the one that says I didn't pussed out?  All he does is bitch, moan, and complain. 
[01:34:00]  What do you see?  You're just completely pussed out there.  But not down the sidewalk after the show.  I try to let it all go.  You're, like, dwelling on it like a...  Yeah, we don't like to...  Ever think I enjoy doing that to you, Anthony?  We don't...  Love the Saw movies.  We don't like to think about what we do on the show after the show's over.  The reason our guests are here instead of listening to us...  Love the Saw movies.  Yeah, but this is different than being asked the same questions, right?  Right, Tobin?  Exactly.  By the way, when Tobin walked in, I knew his face, and I read in the bio, Mississippi  Burning, which is, of course, where I know him from, and this is... 
[01:34:30]  I was in a restaurant about two weeks ago, and there is a waiter, and he looked a lot  like you.  It wasn't, though, Jimmy.  No, no, it wasn't, but it's funny that it was...  It could have very well been.  I was thinking of that Mississippi Burning character about two weeks ago, and I asked  the guy, are you an actor?  And he goes, no.  And I'm like, oh, well, you look like one of the agents from Mississippi Burning.  And he went, oh.  And he kind of, you know...  And now here he is.  Yes, there you are.  That was a great movie.  I know it's a little older.  It was a great thing to be part of.  I got a chance to go to the Deep South and see where the blues was born and in the Mississippi 
[01:35:00]  Delta, and so I very much appreciated being part of that.  How was Gene Hackman?  How great is that to get to work with Gene Hackman?  Wonderful.  Just a wonderful guy.  And I felt blessed after I had done that.  You know, you get a chance to work with people like Francis McDormand and Willem Dafoe and  Alan Parker's had a great career.  So as long as you're working with the English, you're in good shape. 
[01:35:30]  Man, you're intimidating.  Wow.  The voice, the look, the mobility has entered the room.  The voice and the look.  Forget it, man.  The voice and the look.  I was wondering how the hell you book 700 movies.  I was looking at his resume here.  Jesus.  It only goes back to...  And there's more than there's on your resume.  Yeah.  It only goes back to, after number 66 in 1990, it stopped.  It had to stop.  Well, they don't even list the ones that I was an extra in.  Been in a few.  I think they're wrong. 
[01:36:00]  I'm just going to be burning.  I want to say it's 86.  Is that really 88?  We started in 86.  It didn't come out until 88.  Okay.  Took them a long time to put that together.  I just saw Shawnee in Desperate Hours.  I was clicking through with Sir Anthony Hopkins.  Sir Anthony Hopkins.  That must have been something.  That was quite a set, I'll tell you.  You were a little kid in that one.  Michael Cimino and Mickey Rourke just start there.  Yeah.  Yeah, Mickey Rourke.  That was a good movie. 
[01:36:30]  And I ended up doing Becker with Terry Farrell, right?  And she's like, yeah, man, he was calling me from the trailer in that movie.  I'm like, you bitch, that's why he wouldn't get out of his trailer and come to work.  He's probably sitting on the set, Cimino's ready to, like, explode.  He's in the trailer talking to Terry.  Was he difficult?  Everyone says Mickey Rourke is really difficult.  You know, I got a soft spot in my heart for these insane.  But, you know, difficult to get him on the set was a challenge. 
[01:37:00]  Get him out of the trailer.  Get him off the phone with Terry and, you know, onto the set.  Was he, like, prepared to have his lines memorized or was he a little scattered?  What does Jimmy know?  He had some interesting tactics.  Yeah.  Like, what was, like, like, like, and look, Brando was legendary for never, like, he didn't know his lines in the Godfather.  I mean, the cue cards. 
[01:37:30]  That's Brando.  You know, but I think he was a good actor, though.  I mean, as much as he's a wacko, he's a really good actor when he, you know.  Yeah, yeah, he is.  What was a technique that you might think was a little odd?  Um, I don't know.  Reaching under women's skirts.  Oh, Jesus.  That's an odd technique.  What school do they teach that in?  Techniques, like, off camera, too.  When he's off camera and, you know, he'd be like, can you cuss on here?  No.  No.  Well, he'd, you know, be like, uh, he knew, like, personal stuff about, so he'd be, like, yelling all this upsetting stuff at the actor. 
[01:38:00]  He's like, just wants to do the scene right.  It was interesting.  Why was he yelling at the actor?  To get him to a certain place?  Yeah, to, like, you know, get creative, spontaneous.  Wow, that's really not his place to do that, is it?  Isn't that the director's job?  I think that's more, yeah.  Well, I heard Pacino was kind of a dick to, um, instead of a woman, uh, oh, God, the guy, the young lad, Chris, uh... 
[01:38:30]  O'Donnell.  O'Donnell, yeah, I heard he was kind of a dick to him, just so that he wouldn't like him when they were working together, because they weren't supposed to like each other.  Yeah.  You know, there's different ways to, to, uh, try and create a spontaneous...  Yeah.  ...something.  Yeah, you don't have to overdo it, but, uh, somebody asked me yesterday about, uh, Bahar Zumec, who was in Saw III,  and, uh, she plays a doctor that comes in, uh, to, uh, where Shawnee and I live, and they said, uh, geez, did you and Shawnee, uh, kind of, um, uh, you know, gang up on this, this actress, you know, 
[01:39:00]  because you guys were kind of together, and here she is in the middle, how did, how was it on the set?  Was it real edgy, or wasn't it?  And I said, well, I, I said, I'm not worried about that, I don't worry about that, you know, especially because this character, she's supposed to feel that way, so if she feels like an outsider, no problem, it's like gold to her.  It's odd when it goes, like, off set, like that, and then...  Well, you know, nobody did anything mean to her, but I didn't feel obliged to, like, make her feel comfortable, she's not supposed to feel comfortable, so, uh, if you can help the actress out, and, you know, feed what she's supposed to be doing, uh, there's nothing wrong with that. 
[01:39:30]  The Saw movies are great, don't man?  Love them.  Oh, good.  Just those, uh, horrific scenes that you, you watch, and you go, first of all, who the hell thought of that gizmo, and, and then you kind of really start thinking, what would you do in that situation? 
[01:40:00]  Like, they give you these awful choices to make, and, uh, what the hell would you do?  Yeah.  Got that thing around, what was the last one with the thing around the neck, and...  Right, what it takes to make someone make a choice these days.  Yeah, the key is behind your eyeball, and, like, you gotta dig your eye out.  I think that's the most horrifying thing about the whole thing.  Just horrid.  So now you two are teamed up?  Is that what has happened?  Uh.  In Saw 3?  Well, you know, we've been teamed up for a while, and it's just, you see a little more of it. 
[01:40:30]  A little more of that.  Yeah, you get to see, uh, uh, a lot more of a window, uh, into the relationship between Jigsaw and Amanda, and, uh, uh, I kind of like the, the part where, you know, in this whole Saw thing, you don't learn everything all in one fell swoop.  You know, you, you, you learn a little in, in number one about where, where things originated, and then in two, you learn a little more.  And I think, uh, Jigsaw has probably saved his most shocking games for, uh, Saw 3. 
[01:41:00]  So, uh, I haven't seen the film yet, but I'm looking forward to seeing it in a couple of days.  Do you get grossed out or spooked when you, you see, uh, the first one and the second one, and, you know, you're involved with these things, so does it take the edge off?  Well, no, there, there are some aspects of it that, uh, um, when you're looking like there's a scene in, uh, Saw 2 in a needle pit that, uh, my friend, Sean, he, uh, played so marvelously. 
[01:41:30]  And, uh, every time I see even a piece of that scene, uh, it just freaks me out.  You know, it's just an, an amazing, beautifully, wonderfully shot and well-acted pit full of broken syringes.  When you get freaked out, like, does your voice go, like?  A little higher?  Like, oh my God, I'm freaking out.  He never freaks out.  Do I freak out, Sean?  Never.  He never freaks out.  I was shocked when he said a cuss word on the Spike Awards. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  The Scream Awards.  That's really your real voice?  That's your real voice?  I can't imagine going through, like, a day with that voice.  Everything would sound so important.  Yeah, exactly.  You mean overnight rock job.  I'll have, uh, egg white omelet.  Uh, make sure there's cheese on that.  It sounds like he's ready to tell three other guys how he's going to get out of Alcatraz.  Yeah, exactly.  Like, Johnny, it's time to rehearse.  Like, Tobin, I'm with my two kids, you know, we're taking a walk to the beach. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, bring the kids.  I'm going to put in it for the kids.  Bring the kids.  I don't think that's a good idea.  He really is.  Beat up Harrison Ford for that jacket.  You can just see he's got the whole...  Are you guys friends or are you, like, a couple or are you just friends with co-workers?  We're a creative partners.  I couldn't compete with Tobin's wife.  She's the bomb.  Oh, she'll be married?  Okay.  Yeah.  There, let's say hi to Jack in New York City.  Jack, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys? 
[01:43:00]  Hey.  I just realized that it is possible to get the chills six times in two minutes.  Pretty much every time I hear that voice.  Oh, man.  Huge fan of the Saw movies, though.  I was just wondering, was there any kind of a personal reaction from, like, your friends and family, Tobin,  from your voice in the movies relative to, you know, hearing you talk every day in real life?  Yeah, you know, normally it doesn't get talked about.  I spend a lot of time on playgrounds and I coach a little league baseball. 
[01:43:30]  Did you ever...  Well, that's the truth.  And, you know, it doesn't get talked about a lot at home.  Everybody knows.  I've been in this business for a while.  Everybody knows that, you know, the voice comes out and we use it.  We make money.  We pay the bills, the car payments, and that's it, you know.  I think it's great.  It's one of the scariest characters.  Safe to say everyone on that team is running the ball out. 
[01:44:00]  Thank you.  Yeah, it's turned into one of these legendary characters now of, you know, like a pinhead and Jason.  I do yard duty at the Catholic school and I think I'm going to have a lot more authority after this week.  I'm no kidding.  Because all those kids have seen this movie.  It's scary.  What's yard duty?  What's happening in yard duty?  You know, you watch over the maniacs at lunchtime, get beat up by the nun.  She's tough, man.  How old are the kids?  I mean, it's an elementary school up to eighth grade, but my daughter's in second grade. 
[01:44:30]  There's a boy in her class.  He's seen every Saw movie and he keeps threatening me.  He's going to see the third one.  Well, he's in for a wake up.  Yeah.  As of Friday.  Yeah, I walked in.  Heather and I, the lead singer of Hydra Vibe is here in the first, like, female voice in the Saw soundtracks.  And we were at this big music meeting, you know, we're all rocked out and, you know, feeling tough and running around and rock and roll.  And we fly back to yard duty.  I realized I was late.  I, like, run out of the meeting like Cinderella. 
[01:45:00]  We get to the, and she's from Louisiana.  I went to Catholic school.  We come get, you know, we get to the lunchroom and there's this nun half my size.  She's like, I see Verve, you know, my daughter.  I'm like, hey, hey.  I said, so, you know, I just manned the tables.  It was my first day.  She says, what are you doing here?  I said, I'm here, I'm helping with the yard.  You're not allowed in here.  She, like, physically forced both of us out the room.  Thrown out by a nun?  We went from, like, yeah, rock and roll, hot chicks, and the big meetings, right, to getting thrown around by the nun half our size. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah.  It sent Heather in tailspin and the bad flashbacks.  Half your size.  Yeah, that's hard to accomplish, right?  Heather sings on the soundtrack?  Yeah, she's the singer of Hydra Vibe.  Right on, yeah.  Is there going to be a Saw 4?  We're going to see what the fans have to say about Saw 3.  Right, right.  And my sense is that Saw 3 is the best of the three films. 
[01:46:00]  The people whose opinion I respect who have seen it say it's pretty great.  So if the fans, if there's more story to tell, and we can go somewhere with it, and I think there is.  You know, I think the characters are big enough, and the way they've laid it out, the story has been told in small pieces and with clues and hints and things that I think there's lots of opportunity to grow the story. 
[01:46:30]  And if so, and we can get some of the same team back, because that's important to all of us.  Sure.  We'll probably go ahead.  Do you guys get bothered by bad reviews?  Do you read reviews?  Do you take them seriously?  No.  Like, where are you at with that?  Message boards.  Message boards.  Message boards.  Yeah, I can't remember the name of the film that I decided I was going to try to get all the reviews. 
[01:47:00]  Oh.  And I had somebody running around in San Francisco and, you know, like going to the newsstand that carries all the cities, you know, and they would bring me these things.  And I started reading the reviews, and I just, you know, it was a wake up.  You know, you're best off not to read reviews.  Don't you hate critics?  Yeah.  They're just awful.  Well, you know, they do what they do, but, you know, you have no control over that stuff, you know.  You just got to do what you got to do. 
[01:47:30]  Right, right on.  My acting mentor, who did a play with you back here in New York years, years, years ago.  Who's your acting mentor?  Robert Carnegie.  Who's he?  He, I forget the name of the play, but he's basically Sandy Meisner's protege.  He has a theater company in L.A.  A protege and a protege.  Yeah, right.  You know.  We should have Tobin do Steve's lines.  Who's? 
[01:48:00]  We have an actor among us.  You do?  We have a few, actually.  Raise your hands if you're an actor.  Jeez, we got to raise our hands.  We're not going to raise our hands.  Nobody raised their hands.  I've done it, but I don't, you know, you can't be with two real actors and go, me too.  I'm an actor too.  I was a store clerk in an Open Anthony TV commercial.  That's just like your career, sir.  I played a few store clerks.  Yeah.  You know.  And do we have some examples of Steve's acting? 
[01:48:30]  This is Steve.  Steve, here's our actor right here.  Yeah.  Steve.  Oh, Steve.  Hey, yeah.  Here's Steve.  Yeah, exactly.  Steve's looking happy to be in here right now.  Steve, I recognize you.  Oh, come on, Steve.  You're good.  Where's the rest of the Steve?  Uh, what?  Where's the rest of the Steve?  We got this one.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Oh, there it is.  Here's Steve.  Here's Steve delivering his lines.  Now, listen, one line he had to deliver was.  Steve, you look nervous.  No, not nervous.  It's just when the bus tire actually rolls onto your chest, you just have to sort of go limp. 
[01:49:00]  He had to ask how someone's parents died.  And in another scene, it was just him saying, why not?  So we took those two, and you know how much emotion would have to go into asking someone  how their parents died?  And then just why not as a throwaway line.  Listen to the difference, the dynamic.  Before you play that, though, I was wondering maybe if Tobin could, like, do the line, and  then we'll show Tobin how Steve did it.  Is that okay with you?  Absolutely.  I'd like to. 
[01:49:30]  All right.  Give him his motivation, and then the line he has to say.  And then I'll review you both.  Yeah.  Oh, great.  Well, just a throwaway, like, you don't really care.  Somebody may ask you to go somewhere.  You don't really care.  You just go, why not?  You know, why not?  That's it.  Why not?  There you go.  Why not?  Why not?  Yeah.  See?  You got a couple of different variations from them, too, Steve.  Right.  This is what Steve does.  And now this one, the line is, had your parents die. 
[01:50:00]  Now, you would think that's very.  Had or how'd.  How'd.  How'd your parents die?  You'd think it's a very emotional thing.  You'd want a little sympathy, a little curiosity to it and stuff.  And Steve delivered it perfectly.  But I'd like to see how a real actor would deliver that.  How'd your parents die?  Do I have to have the contraction in there, the how'd?  Or can I say how'd?  Whatever you want to do it.  I just want to make sure.  You sure you don't want to have a meeting about it. 
[01:50:30]  You're the professional.  You're the professional.  You're the professional.  These kind of things.  Yeah, right?  And action.  How did your parents die?  Wow.  Wow.  See?  Wow.  That was good.  I think you screwed, Steve.  Wow.  That was good, eh?  All right.  Now, here is the dynamic.  That was a good question about the contraction, though, because anybody wanted to do it.  They know.  Yeah.  Perfect.  Perfect.  Here is Steve delivering those two lines.  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  Listen to the dynamic difference in both of them. 
[01:51:00]  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  Wait, wait.  How'd your parents die?  Wait, wait.  The bus is backing up.  Evidently.  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  It wasn't quite as poignant as Tobin.  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  Oh.  He's got a lot of range.  He's got a lot of range.  Yeah.  Slightly different.  A lot of range, Tobin.  Slightly different.  Versatility of a rake.  You stink.  Yes, I do.  Shawnee, you started so young. 
[01:51:30]  How did you get into acting?  What'd you do?  Commercials?  Yeah, commercials.  Yeah?  There was a girl on the street who did the Northern Toilet Paper.  Northern Toilet Paper?  You did a toilet paper commercial?  No, the girl up the street did.  Bitch.  And unfortunately, we went for walks around the block.  My mom talked to her mom.  Got my mom's panties all in a bunch about, you know, my daughter could do that.  And so the next thing I know, she's got me on with the camera taking pictures and send  it to the agency.  And then I'm on a McDonald's commercial. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, you make it sound so easy.  Yeah.  And then you were like, just, you know, kind of watched you grow up every so often.  It's like, hey, there she is.  Yeah.  I remember her from that last movie.  She was a little younger in the last movie.  Have you been stalking her?  Yeah, totally.  A little creepy.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  She's one of my faves.  Yeah.  Pops up in movies all the time.  Overnight success with the Saw movies.  Yeah.  Very cool.  After two decades.  Oh, please.  Love it.  I'm sure people are constantly like, you get recognized a lot, don't you?  Not a lot. 
[01:52:30]  Really?  Not a lot.  People recognize me more when they hear me speak than looking at me.  Yeah.  Because, you know, I don't always have this.  Different color hair.  Yeah.  Just all rocked out today.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I glammed up for you guys.  Glammed.  Fantastic.  Thank you.  I heard you were edgy.  Yeah.  I think we have to get them out of here.  Edgy.  They're telling us you had a...  Yeah.  We just saw you on TV.  I wanted to talk about it.  Where are you going on next, you guys?  I have no idea.  Neither do I.  They just cart you around.  It's too overwhelming to look at the big picture.  How did your parents die? 
[01:53:00]  Oh, is that good, man?  It really is.  Wow.  I believe it when he says that.  That's the way it's delivered, you dork.  All right.  I'll tell you how Steve's parents died.  They shot themselves after they heard his performance.  Yes, they did.  Well, when does the movie come out?  Saw 3.  Next Friday.  Friday.  October 27th.  This Friday, yeah.  That's this one.  This Friday.  Yeah.  Great.  Looks forward to it.  This Friday.  Yeehaw.  More of Jigsaw's shenanigans. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  If I may call them shenanigans.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Shenaniganery.  Very cool.  Yeah, Jigsaw reaching out into the world.  Cool.  From his room.  That room.  Right.  Nice.  Looking forward to it.  Thanks for stopping by.  It was great chatting with you guys.  Saw 3 this Friday.  Steve.  Yeah.  Keep it up.  Keep it up, baby.  Thank you very much.  Don't let the critics bring you down.  Oh, I never would.  You know why, Steve?  Because they don't know.  That's right.  Okay.  That's right.  Tobin Bell and Shoney Smith. 
[01:54:00]  Saw 3 opens Friday.  Thank you, guys.  Thank you.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Hey, what's up?  It's Louis Twitchell Santani.  Shut up!  Tourette's Day is coming to the Opie and Anthony Show,  which is to say that we've discovered a new excuse to point and laugh at people who are different.  To help us understand a little bit more about Tourette's,  we've enlisted the help of hearing-impaired Chicago reporter Karen Meyer.  Tourette's been drawn into a new radical disorder  that's characterized by involuntary sticks and repeated vocalizations. 
[01:54:30]  Exactly.  So if you have Tourette's or if you know somebody with Tourette's,  muster up some courage and an ounce of self-control  and get in touch with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Contact Steve at foundrymusic.com.  That's Steve at foundrymusic.com.  And remember, be yourself one ticket at a time.  Tourette's Day.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  We all noticed that Anthony was a bit smitten. 
[01:55:00]  You guys are just a bit smitten with Tony Smith from Saw 3.  Every emotion I've never seen, he's bashful, shy, looking down at the carpet.  I was just, it was one of those like...  As soon as he went to commercial, he's kind of kicking the ground,  looking down and trying to talk to her a little more.  I was like, you're a shock doc.  I wasn't, I wanted a picture.  And then it wound up being like 10 pictures.  Yeah. 
[01:55:30]  Because they had a professional photographer with them.  No, that was your photographer that you brought in for this moment, it looked like.  I didn't bring in a photographer.  We don't know who that guy was.  It was just intimidating.  I've seen her in so many movies and everything.  And, you know, his voice went all up high.  You're so much smaller in real life.  I said she, because I...  Ew.  No.  No.  Did you say that?  No, he went to commercial.  He's looking at her.  He's like...  We were talking.  And we were talking right here.  And she, I just said, I go, babe, you are so much tinier than you are. 
[01:56:00]  That's not how you said it.  That guy...  No, no, now it sounds good.  What?  How did I say it?  Now it sounds like the Anthony we all know and love.  How did I say it?  Bill Burr will do it.  That's how he said.  You're like, you're so much tinier than you are.  You brought your shoulders up to your ears.  There was little birds flying around his head.  You are an ass.  We saw this.  That's how you did it.  We all saw the stress in your shoulders.  They went up.  You're looking kind of down, bashful, shy. 
[01:56:30]  He had a shucks vibe.  I don't know how to deal with this.  You couldn't even say it.  Did I really sound like that?  Oh, yeah, you did.  I just feel like I watched you grow up in the movies.  Shut up.  No, Billy's saying it's even worse.  Oh, it's terrible.  No, it's pretty...  Oh, God.  It's pretty close, Ant.  Even during the interview, you kept going back to her, no matter what he was talking about.  I know.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Goodbye, goodbye.  Sure, didn't you...  How did you get into this?  But he wouldn't really look at her.  He just kept looking down at the ground.  Yeah, Toba was...  Like he wasn't worthy.  Toba was... 
[01:57:00]  Toba started admitting that he has, like, bodies buried in his backyard.  And you're like, well, anyway, Shawnee, uh...  Yeah, do you get nervous when you're...  I didn't ask that.  I just thought...  What happens when you're on the set?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  You are asses.  Anthony was smitten.  Smitten.  It was 1880.  I just...  I'm a fan of hers. 
[01:57:30]  Can I get your autograph?  She's very tiny.  I didn't ask for her autograph.  And she's cute.  What do you want me to say?  You should have told her about that.  I really admire your work.  You should have told her about that hot rod you bought recently.  Yes.  I didn't bring up my car.  Maybe you could go for a malt.  You want to see my car?  Shut up.  It's really fast.  Go to Inspiration Point.  I've watched the submarine races.  You two...  You three.  All of you. 
[01:58:00]  Dude, we're all looking around the room like, wow, we haven't seen this side of Anthony.  Why?  The hands in his pockets.  Shoulders up, looking down at you around.  Do you realize you turned beet red?  You have no idea.  You have no idea, obviously.  I didn't blush.  I don't blush.  You've never had rosy cheeks since I've known you.  I don't blush.  You look like you're in a Christmas special.  It was Christmas morning, Anthony.  I don't blush.  I was just... 
[01:58:30]  So, do you have any more projects coming up?  I was conducting an interview.  You're too beautiful to do a McDonald's commercial.  I didn't say that either.  You might as well have.  I'm just a big fan.  Anything that you're in, I'll go and see it.  That was high school Anthony.  That was high school shy Anthony.  Oh, Jesus.  That was not radio star Anthony.  That was high school Anthony.  Shawnee, do you have a fan site?  Maybe I can run your fan site for you?  I didn't ask that either. 
[01:59:00]  Her bodyguard's taking pictures of him because they know he's going to be a stalker.  Right, yeah.  You're on file now, bro.  It's on file.  My car is blue because I heard you like blue.  It's red.  Oh.  Like my cheeks.  You could not tell her the contest was called Fatty Pig Fatty.  Well, they had just come in and I didn't know what their vibe was.  You're in soccer!  I didn't know if they would be offended by this.  There was no they.  You were worried that your girlfriend was going to be...  Right, right. 
[01:59:30]  I have a girlfriend and she is home.  Her name is Shawnee.  No!  Might as well be.  Oh, coming up, they're going to be on the CW11 News.  You're probably going to tape it and watch it ten times tonight.  Yeah.  You better hurry up and end the radio show so Anthony can watch her on another show.  Would you stop it already?  I'm just a fan.  Bill Burr picked up on you.  You were looking at the floor.  Bill Burr would do anything he can to throw me under the bus.  I don't know.  Listen.  And he's kind of kicking the ground a little bit like, I don't know. 
[02:00:00]  I was thinking.  I thought it was nice.  It was sweet.  Yeah.  To finally see this man giving in to love and emotions that he had to show.  Well, when you said...  What did you say?  I think you're great.  I don't want to mess it up.  As soon as we went to commercial, you looked at her and said...  And you thought none of us were listening.  I said, had your parents died.  No.  No.  I said, you're so tiny.  You're so much smaller than you are in the movies.  You know how you said tiny, though?  You went, you're so tiny. 
[02:00:30]  Well, how are you supposed to say you're so tiny?  No, you said...  You're so tiny.  You're so much smaller than you are.  Yeah, small broad.  It was just how your voice changed.  Hey, dame.  You're so much tinier.  Well, you expected it to be 35 feet tall like she is in a movie theater.  No, but she comes off looking a lot bigger on screen.  Jimmy is right.  We saw high school Anthony today.  That was high school Anthony.  That was...  That's what makes Anthony do the brilliant impressions.  That was shy. 
[02:01:00]  That was...  Anthony's so funny and so good at impressions because he wanted girls to like him.  And he was shy in high school.  You are killing me here.  Who would ever want to go out with me?  You are killing me here.  I'm just a lug.  He would just be making her laugh all night because he'd want her to stay and stay  interested.  Holy Jesus.  The second she would start laughing, he would actually screw up the impression because he'd  be so excited.  You got all this worked out, don't you, Bill?  I saw it, man.  I saw you, Bill.  We saw it.  He wants to go on a date with her like the original Karate Kid. 
[02:01:30]  He wants his mom to pick her up in the station wagon and drop them both off at a fair.  What?  And they called me puppy love.  Shut up.  This is not puppy love.  Are you going to give her your varsity sweater?  What year is this?  Can I get another photo?  I didn't ask for another photo.  They did. 
[02:02:00]  I asked for one photo.  But you had no problem staying there for like 10 straight minutes.  And I took one photo with Shawnee and then, and then, uh, and you said something about  the photo like, oh, that one was smiley.  You said something about, no, I didn't.  He said something about the photo like they did it wrong.  He's like, no, that one was smiley.  She goes, are you going to do a smiling or tough guy picture?  And I said, oh, they already took one.  And I was doing the smiley guy. 
[02:02:30]  No, you were just giggling.  Yeah.  I don't think I giggled at all.  You're a good woman like that.  Bill, I don't think I giggled once the entire time his voice was cracking.  Oh, my God.  I did not giggle once.  Well, hold on a minute.  Let's say hi to Mike in New Jersey.  Let's go, Mike.  Hi, guys.  Somebody should look around Anthony's area and see if he's doodling Shawnee Kumi on  a picture somewhere.  Jackass.  I'm not doodling anything, but Mike from Jersey's a tool. 
[02:03:00]  He's working on his VH logo, and he's got a little heart with Shawnee in it.  Yeah, AC plus SS.  That's right.  It's Shawnee, and then an N under it with a line on each side of it, and then Anthony  under it with a little arrow through it.  Guys, hold on.  We've got a song for Anthony and his new love, Shawnee Smith, from Saw 3.  Yeah.  Great.  Yeah, we could hold hands and go to the park with this music playing. 
[02:03:30]  Skip right down the street with her if she asks you to.  You could stop at the Ant and Shawnee sitting in a tree things on Pal Talk, you idiot.  No, I didn't tell her she's my density.  What a bunch of tools.  I'm a fan of hers, and I think she's cute. 
[02:04:00]  You said you watched her grow up on TV, which is even creepier.  No, I saw movies because she started when she was very young.  We even said that in the middle of the interview.  Somebody mentioned something, he sounds like a stalker.  Yeah.  It started to come out.  Yeah.  Oh, because I'm interested in her work.  Do you have a room in your house dedicated to her?  I do not have the Shawnee Smith room.  Still in the boxes?  Don't open them.  I thought she was very good in The Stand. 
[02:04:30]  You said to her, I can't look at you without thinking Julie, the little character.  Julie Lowry from The Stand is a great character.  You don't say anything in that character.  Julie Lowry.  You don't talk like that ever.  Jimmy's imitating me.  You don't ever talk like that.  Yeah, your voice got all weird in front of me.  How did it get weird?  And we started looking around the room like, what is he doing?  Oh, my God.  And the shoulders come up.  Julie Lowry.  She had Anne from Hello.  Okay, you are going to be banned, too.  I'm going to start bouncing, you smart asses. 
[02:05:00]  You said to her, because he was telling a story, and you went, so Shawnee, how did you  get into acting?  How did you get into it?  I didn't, and you're kicking your legs.  My legs right now, here's how Anthony's legs were.  They were kind of dangling and not touching the stool, and they were crossed.  Like one would kiss him.  He had his hands between his legs.  Yeah, he was all like.  I did not.  He was trying to make himself as small as possible, because he was so uncomfortable in her presence.  Oh, my God.  We're supposed to be shock jocks.  We're shocking. 
[02:05:30]  Get a hold of yourself.  That's his kryptonite right there.  It is not.  It is.  That and 500-pound black women.  I will admit that I'm a fan.  Look, there's nothing wrong with the fact you've got a crush on her.  She's beautiful.  You have a crush on her?  You're Smith.  He's talking like Anthony now.  I will admit I'm a fan.  Where was that in the interview?  Julie Lowry.  I want to curse at you so badly.  You almost said you were talking like the guy from the Warriors.  I like Julie Lowry. 
[02:06:00]  Hey, let's go to John in Texas.  We got people sticking up for you, Anthony.  Here's John in Texas.  Hey, guys.  Love the show.  Yeah.  I was just wondering, Anthony, did you give her your pledge pins?  I thought you were.  Oh, wow.  You are.  I thought he was sticking up for you.  Well, Mike in Brooklyn sticking up for you.  Hey, Mike.  Oh, great.  Hey, Anthony.  Let me ask you a question.  You're going to give her a mixtape, too?  I like it.  With songs that kind of like the lyrics she should listen to.  Would you shut up? 
[02:06:30]  Listen to the words.  Listen to the words.  Julie Lowry.  Julie Lowry.  She shot Cyrus.  For what?  Love, so to Kenny.  Did you notice that ant was a little smitten there?  Come on.  Who else wants to step up to the mic?  We all saw it.  Hey, look.  Everybody has their weakness.  It's not my weakness.  It's not my weakness.  What am I supposed to do?  You could talk like a man. 
[02:07:00]  I conducted an interview.  Someone just pointed out.  I did.  Let's just be honest here.  You didn't talk to Whoopi the same way you talked to Shawnee, okay?  Well, duh.  You know, they're pointing that out there on their mobile devices.  Let's say hi to Russ in Ohio.  No, I didn't say get your goddamn hands off her knee to Tobin.  Yeah, Tobin was like, that's why Tobin was doing it.  He's like, what is going on here?  I'm your protector.  He had his hand on her knee and everything.  Oh, and then we made that joke about him wanting to hook up and have sex with her, 
[02:07:30]  and he literally was like, well, why do you have to bring it there?  He couldn't even visualize her as anything other than an object of beauty.  What was that?  Because I don't even know what the hell you're talking about.  Because you were so smitten, you can't even remember.  You weren't a daze.  You really weren't a daze.  I've never seen you like that.  Little Tweety birds flying around your head.  Hold on.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Well, it's rare that Ant gets in this position. 
[02:08:00]  Anthony, not Kumia from East Brunswick, New Jersey.  All I could picture was Anthony resting his chin on his fist.  Yeah.  You're so tiny.  I just want to put you in my pocket and take you home with me.  He didn't say that.  I think he creeped her out.  By the end of it, he creeped her out.  Yeah, she took the pictures.  She was not creeped out in the least.  She loved me.  Don't crap in your hat.  She was screaming at the publicist on the way out.  Why do I have to be around that creep?  She was not creeped out.  She took extra pictures of me.  Exactly.  To have distributed to all her handlers. 
[02:08:30]  Shut up.  Bill from Pittsburgh.  Anthony wanted to slip her a note asking, do you like me?  Circle yes or no.  You just look tinier than I thought you were.  I don't know.  Julie Lowry.  Julie Lowry.  I like doing things like that.  No reason.  No.  Oh, Julie Lowry.  Come out and play.  Oh, I want to smack him in the face.  Why don't you meet her outside her next interview with a boombox, you faggot. 
[02:09:00]  God damn.  Look, he's just trying to shake it up.  I really am.  We all saw you.  I am trying so hard.  It was funny.  You wouldn't look at it with Fatty Pig Fatty.  Like, I don't know.  I don't know.  No.  I am not going to ask Club Soda Kenny for two straws for my smoothie. 
[02:09:30]  It should be a strawberry shake.  You two should be an old man Rafferty's.  You should be having a strawberry shake.  And you're wearing your sweater.  You are a bunch of...  Don't give me her bio again, fan.  I know her whole body of work.  He's like in one of those bad 80s comings of age movies where she's dating the football  players like an unbelievable, you know, the biggest dick ever.  And he's just sitting there.  If she was my girlfriend, I would treat her like a princess.  Were you having pictures in your head like trains going through tunnels? 
[02:10:00]  It's the opium.  Fireworks going off.  Opium ducky show.  That's who you are for that Molly Ringworld.  You're a ducky.  Ducky.  What is this?  Won't you ever eat up around your neck?  You pick some of the worst stupid love songs.  This is when you guys go to Vegas to do your overnight wedding.  I'm not doing an overnight wedding.  I can picture him in a white sweater with a big red D on it.  I am shaking this off. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, that's all right.  I don't like the way you guys are picking on me because I just-  You were looking forward to this all week.  I was a fan.  Well, no, we were looking around the room like, are you hearing what I'm hearing?  Like, what?  I was helping conduct an interview like I would with any other movie.  And he was working those eyes of his movie star.  I was not blinking.  He was batting his eyes at her.  I was not batting my eyes.  You looked like a puggle.  I was.  You were like that female Dino from the Flintstones. 
[02:11:00]  Blink, blink.  Holy Jesus, are you guys complete asses.  I don't want to say the contest.  It's called the $10 a penny.  I forgot about that one, Jimmy.  Stop laughing at me, Kenny.  $10 a pound?  It's called the $10 a pound contest.  Well, it was because they had just walked in and I didn't want to put them off.  I know, and she was so tiny.  At the beginning of it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my dear sweet Jesus.  You just want to hold her, don't you? 
[02:11:30]  Or have her hold you.  No.  Yeah, I'll rock you gently from side to side.  High school Anthony wants to put his face on her shoulder and just go, no.  Thank you.  I need to be hugged.  He really was looking away bashful.  Like the buzzard in Bugs Bunny.  No, no, no, no.  He'll say the name of the contest.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  Jesus Christ, you guys suck.  Hey, hey, hey, hey. 
[02:12:00]  Julie Lowry.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Stop it.  I just, like I said, I'm a fan.  And that's it.  I was conducting an interview.  I scared nobody.  You gave her the heat.  I am not a threatening person.  No, he has got a personality when he needs to, man.  I was being nice.  Yeah, he didn't scare her.  No, let me tell you something.  What do you think Saw 3 is scary? 
[02:12:30]  You should have seen the time.  Right.  It was the same love and look Hinkley game.  Jodie Slaughter.  I know.  Someone wants to know if you're so excited.  Are you going to do the footloose dance on the walkover?  No, I'm not going to do it.  Would you stop it?  Why can't I just kind of be a fan and not get this type of abuse?  Do we do?  No, it's okay.  It was good to see you giving me those feelings.  Yeah, do we have the Davy Jones song?  Girl, look what you've done to me. 
[02:13:00]  Well, how about bah, bah, bah?  Come on, the big one, Hawk.  Find it.  Mm-hmm.  Oh.  No, great.  It's Davy Jones from the Brady Bunch.  That's what he was like.  He was Marsha Brady meeting Davy Jones.  Now you're saying I'm like Marsha Brady?  Oh, you know.  You had her body English.  Look what you've done to me.  You are just the scum of the earth, all of you. 
[02:13:30]  It looked like you were sweet on her.  You take something that is just an innocent nothingness and blow it way out of proportion.  Maybe what you're really feeling.  Take something so beautiful.  I didn't say that.  You're unsoiled in innocent.  Oh, my God.  Am I getting a hammering?  I'm a Nazi.  Are you a Nazi?  How do you survive in Hollywood?  Because they run it.  You're going to give her your favorite Nazi memorabilia, aren't you? 
[02:14:00]  No.  And if she is Jewish, he would treat her the way that Amon Gertz treated his maid.  He'd just waltz around her in the basement and not kill her.  How did someone get the name Shawnee Ant so quick?  I'm bouncing that person.  You're bounced.  Shant.  When they start dating.  I'm sure.  Are you done? 
[02:14:30]  Are you finished?  Do you feel better about yourself?  Do you feel all good about yourselves now?  I'm just thinking if you're going to have his and her hazmat suits with your initials on them.  Shut up.  Even though there's only two E's in your name, I say it like there's four.  Shawnee.  Oh, you're lucky.  Oh, look at the time.  Are you lucky?  Oh, you're made by the bell.  Oh, look at the time.  You are a lucky man.  Like this disaster isn't carrying over to the other portion of the show. 
[02:15:00]  Nice beating on the walkover.  I'll be able to call you guys when I want to.  I want to do my promo as Anthony.  All right.  Bill Burr, everyone.  I'm going to be at Comics Come Home up in Boston with Dennis Leary.  Shawnee, you want to go to the container store?  The car's real fast.  Get some containers for your t-shirt.  All right.  Dennis Leary's so much taller in real life.  Shut up.  Hey, the Opie and Anthony Halloween Party is brought to you by Saw 3.  Starring. 
[02:15:30]  Great movie.  Johnny Smith.  Johnny Smith is in that one, I hear.  Oh, yeah.  And Tobin Bell.  People are saying.  As well.  If it's Halloween, it must be Saw in theaters everywhere Friday.  And I also, usually we don't throw this all together at the end, but we have to today.  Today's football picks were sponsored by Dish Network.  More football for you.  Better TV for all.  Call 1-888-GET-DISH.  We had a lot of fun today, guys.  If you're not joining us over at XM, have a great day.  Bill Burr, thanks for stopping by today.  No problem, Mike.  We'll see you over at XM.  Thanks.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye. 
[02:16:00]  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Opie and Anthony's appearance on The Late Show with David Letterman will re-air tonight,  Tuesday, October 17th.  Jim Norton is scheduled to appear on The Late Show on November 1st.  Check local listings for showtimes.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  Outside Free FM in New York City.  Hey.  Where did Honey go? 
[02:16:30]  Back to Binghamton.  She's a lot better.  She enjoyed herself?  Yeah, she had a good time.  Yeah?  She up and left.  She left, yeah.  Yeah, these are the guys that brought Honey by.  She's going to come back to collect her check.  Yeah, Bob.  Believe me, it's going to be hard to beat, 505 pounds.  New leader in the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest.  Yeah.  That's the name of the contest, by the way, Anthony.  I know it's the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest.  What was it?  $10 a pound.  God damn it.  I sounded like Sam when I said that.  $10 a pound?  Pound?  You weren't as nice to Honey, by the way. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, why?  No, I wasn't.  Honey, honey.  I certainly wasn't.  My own girlfriend sold me out in a text message right when I walked downstairs.  Yeah.  Yeah, she's telling me what they're printing on the pad data.  Apparently, Derek was having a blast over there.  Anthony Hart, Shawnee.  Anthony loves Shawnee.  And he probably spelled it S-H-A-U-N-E.  Oh, he probably spelled my name wrong.  Dolt.  Stupid ass, we all know he is.  Shut up, Derek.  You're an idiot. 
[02:17:30]  Let's walk over there.  All right, let's start the walk to XM.  Would you stop with the baby talk?  I did no baby talking.  It's a dead-on impression.  It wasn't a baby talk.  Jim Norton is showing a new versatility.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Complete, total asshole.  No, dead-on impressions.  Noah.  Noah.  Don't you.  Doug, get in the store.  Don't look.  Don't look nice.  People.  You know Anthony's going to be brutal on the walk over. 
[02:18:00]  He's trying to get this shit off of him.  Yeah, he's trying to shit off.  I got to knock it off, man.  What the fuck are you looking at?  There we go.  Wow, the sidewalk's very crowded today.  Brr.  Oh, that's cold out here.  I know.  I brought my big, heavy, homeless guy jacket, but didn't put it on.  You don't need to.  You're all warm inside.  God, I can't slip this.  I can't slip this.  It's very rare when he gets in the old bucket.  I'm trying to slip this.  It really is.  This is a fucking arm bar. 
[02:18:30]  It's over.  Suck.  It's all right.  It's okay.  It's not.  I did no baby talking.  Don't worry.  It's only about an hour left of abuse.  What do we got going on over at XM?  Not much today.  Oh, shit.  Unfortunately for you.  Yeah.  Fuckers.  I don't think the phones will be lit when we get there.  Yeah, great.  I'm sure they forgot about it.  They're going to want to talk about Obama or something else.  What's in the suitcase?  Is it pictures with Shawnee? 
[02:19:00]  Why can't I change the subject?  God damn it.  Just walk into traffic.  Oh.  It is cold out here.  I was talking to this gentleman.  Oh.  There you are.  And that gentleman.  Look at Kathy Bates.  You'd never tell Shawnee to walk into traffic.  We got to get her back on the phone. 
[02:19:30]  Not only would he not say that, he would go, look both ways.  You guys really.  You want me to carry you?  Really suck.  Cross on the green and not in between.  Sweetie.  Can we get her back on the phone?  No.  Where's the one?  We got to get her back on the phone.  No way.  Come on.  You're going to hang me out.  No, we won't.  Oh, no, you won't.  No.  Come on, Anthony.  We'll get to hear her voice.  Shut the fuck up. 
[02:20:00]  Bill is the worst pile-on-er I've ever seen.  I actually started this one.  Yes, he did.  Yeah, he did.  Good for you.  I'm happy I did.  He definitely did.  Let's look at the thing and see what new...  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's good.  Hey, you think Shawnee likes Barry Manilow?  Bastards.  Our name was Shawnee.  Jesus Christ.  Jesus Christ.  Am I going to shake this? 
[02:20:30]  No, you're not.  I'm going to shake it today.  Thank you.  It sticks.  We'll stick for a lot of people on the walk today.  On a cold...  Oh, good.  Now it's warm.  Yeah, too cold out there.  We had to walk right in.  It was too cold out there.  All right.  Do you want to give the word up?  The word that's given.  Blah, blah, blah.  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country. 
[02:21:00]  Creeps, ankle biters.  Obviously, the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow.  How long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right.  Here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show. 
[02:21:30]  Out of touch.  Cornwalls.  Three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM.  Opie.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver. 
[02:22:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  We'll be right back. 
[02:22:30]  Settling it. 
[02:23:00]  Wow.  That weather's annoying.  What happened?  That weather's annoying.  It's a little too cold out to really interact with anybody.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  There we go.  Oh, band two?  Where the hell is it?  That's your job, Than.  That's your job.  I'm trying to deflect. 
[02:23:30]  Than's even getting me.  That's broken.  What happened?  The camera's busted?  Oh, yeah.  I broke that last time.  Is it still?  Yeah.  No fixing it?  I broke its neck.  And then there's not one in the...  I don't know.  We'll have to get another one.  You know what you do?  Take the stick out.  What's wrong?  Try that.  Like, pop the stick out.  What is it?  Just pull it straight up.  And now pop it out of the bottom of the camera. 
[02:24:00]  And now just plug it into the camera into the base.  Why is that in front of me?  It's two females.  No, it should go.  Isn't it?  It should go.  I don't know.  There you go.  Now give it a try.  Hopefully it's just a broken stick.  No.  No?  No.  Oh, look.  See?  It's rebooting.  It just moved.  Is that what that just did?  Wow.  That was scary.  There we go.  See?  I just fixed the camera. 
[02:24:30]  That's great, Anthony.  See?  What?  Are you trying to brush Shawnee?  Who gives a shit?  No.  I just knew I could fix it.  We're really giving him an opportunity to switch.  Here, you brought up the weather first.  Yeah.  Gee, it sure is cold out there.  Just another 58 minutes.  That's all.  Really?  Nothing says I'm in love like talking about the weather.  Look, man. 
[02:25:00]  It's an observation.  What can I tell you?  It happens.  It's got to be ashamed of.  I thought it was sweet.  I think you just observed a little wrong.  You exaggerated, greatly exaggerated what you observed.  Yeah.  I thought it was sweet.  Oh, yeah.  I looked a little.  Hey, I would suggest this.  Now that you heard the aftermath, during the replay today, you better pay close attention.  You're going to pick up on a few things.  Well, if anybody was listening on Pal Talk, that's when he did the... 
[02:25:30]  Yeah, the...  You're so tiny.  You're so much tidier than you are in the movies.  If I said it like that, please...  Shoulders up.  Just shoot me.  Why?  It's not shootable.  Because I didn't say it like that.  Why don't you loan me one of your guns?  I didn't say it like that in a baby voice.  You're sweet.  Where's Roland?  I said it in...  Let's get Roland in here.  Roland knows.  In a normal tone.  I don't...  Like any person would.  By the way, Jimmy...  Really fast, I've got to update Jimmy because he was in San Francisco.  You missed Friday's show. 
[02:26:00]  Roland was classic.  Oh, yeah.  Did I miss Roland?  We did an impromptu dating game with the fat broad from our TV commercial.  Dude, it was priceless.  Roland's not here yet.  I go back to his office for a minute, then he's coming back.  Okay.  All right, because we're going to try to get Shawnee on the phone one more time.  Why?  Don't be shy.  Why are you going to do that?  Talk to her.  Why are you going to do that?  Don't be shy.  Yeah, and don't make you be mean to her.  I think you have a shot.  Whoever is Julie Lowry on Pal Talk, stop IMing me with you are dreamy. 
[02:26:30]  I'm banning you.  You know what?  Oh, Al missed one today.  What?  Uh-oh.  8.06 a.m., the only dump of the day.  Bullshit.  Opie coughing the word, but it was still clear.  I did not.  I purposely made sure I didn't go, bullshit.  What did you go?  Bullshit.  No, I just went...  Oh.  I purposely made sure that it was nowhere near bullshit.  I knew that would panic him.  Whatever.  That was...  Whatever.  That was Woodshop Anthony. 
[02:27:00]  Woodshop Anthony.  That was Anthony in Woodshop.  That was...  Yeah.  High school Anthony.  Like, you'd make her something in Woodshop.  You'd make her like, look, it's a little jewelry case to put your rings in.  A little birdhouse.  A birdhouse.  I don't think I would.  That was high school Anthony.  Who said that?  Jimmy?  Yeah.  High school Anthony came out today.  He certainly did.  And by the way, it does happen from time to time.  Shy.  Usually with hot starlets.  It does.  You should have on a Leonard Skinner t-shirt and a long flannel with your poofed out, like,  curly... 
[02:27:30]  It was actually a dopey army jacket.  Oh, is it?  Yeah.  Both hands and you're stuffed into your pockets.  Yeah.  Stuffed deep.  Yeah.  You want me to play Come Again for you?  Some loot music?  No.  No loot music, please.  Anyone else hear this engine revving up again?  Why?  We're getting up to speed.  All right.  Shawnee's very busy for the rest of the day.  I don't think you should have Roland chasing her down and trying to call her. 
[02:28:00]  Bunch of tools.  Come on, man.  A whole lot of you.  Just say hi to her.  You're the worst of them all, Burr.  Get the ball going.  You're the worst one of them all.  Get the ball going.  By the way, a lot of people...  I'm rooting for you, man.  Jimmy and Opie are very fucking in-your-face.  You're this covert scumbag that just wants to fucking be on the pile and get your digs in.  I picked up the flag.  Even the way you led the charge was bad.  Because you're like, no, it's cool.  Like, no, don't be...  It is, though. 
[02:28:30]  No, it doesn't.  It's nice.  It's nice to see...  Look at his fucking passive-aggressive bullshit.  You know, when you see a...  I'm telling you, whenever I see a connection between two people like that, I mean, even  an asshole like me, it warms my heart.  Oh, shit.  It was great.  For a Monday, too, man, for you to be feeling that.  I mean, that's true feelings.  One thing I...  One thing it was like Thursday or Friday, then it's maybe part of that you're excited for  the weekend.  But this is Monday.  You've got a whole long week of work.  This is why you're the biggest scumbag in this room.  Little butterflies.  You're just that. 
[02:29:00]  Because even though he goes, yeah, I started it.  I started it.  The way he started it.  Oh, dude, you know, the way your feelings are coming out, that's a great thing.  That's a...  I'm on your side.  No, you're not.  You're not.  Are you sure?  I would never think you are.  Are you sure he's not?  No one is on my side right here.  I am rooting for you and Johnny.  See?  Can we...  I don't know why we don't have clips of the interview by now.  I think we need a couple clips.  Oh, I want to hear this voice now. 
[02:29:30]  I think that's...  Let me tell you why.  They're all going to be taken out of fucking context, and I'm going to sound like a jackass.  Yeah, well, you know.  Yeah, well, you know.  It's your lot in life.  So go fuck yourself.  Look, you know as well as I.  We have to fill an hour and a half.  This is a fun way to do it.  Can't we just play Steve clips?  Nah, that's getting played out.  This is...  Yeah.  Although, no one's going to remember Tobin doing Steve's clips now.  Doing Steve's wonderful...  Maybe we should focus more on it.  We have new Steve clips.  Why not?  How did your parents die? 
[02:30:00]  How did your parents die?  How did your parents die?  How did your parents die?  Wasn't that a great delivery of Steve's awful line?  How did your parents die?  Huh?  Oh, yeah.  Can't we all get on board with that now?  How did your parents die?  Can't we all...  No, huh?  If you were picking up Shawnee for a date and you had to meet Tobin and that was her father,  you completely implode.  Where are you taking my daughter?  I'm taking her to the movie. 
[02:30:30]  I'll have her back by 11.  Jason, Oklahoma, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  I was wanting to know if Anthony was going to be on Oprah's show jumping on her couch.  I love it.  Fuck you, Jason.  Did you ha-ha me?  Am I being ha-ha'd?  Oh, Shawnee checking in now on Instant Message. 
[02:31:00]  Don't tell them, but I love you too.  XOXO.  All the things are just getting blocked.  Dude, everyone's asking for the voice.  I don't...  Close your eyes.  There's no way I could do this voice that you're saying.  Picture, picture, picture.  This made-up voice.  She had very tight leopard skin.  No, it's not like that.  Don't insult her.  We already tried to go that route.  What?  He gets offended if you make her a sexual object.  I didn't say shit.  He's an object of beauty.  That's right.  Oh my good God.  I didn't say anything. 
[02:31:30]  And I don't know what voice you're talking about.  I conducted an interview like I would anybody else sitting there.  Oh, you certainly did.  And, um...  You just kind of get, like, that cute...  Oh, shit.  See, you are blowing this way out of proportion.  Yeah, with a little bit of creepiness.  Like, if he had the opportunity, he hit her with a hammer and then just sit there stroking  her hair.  Where the fuck did you get a hammer now?  Let me...  What am I...  I'm a murderer now.  If I can't handle that collection...  Let me tell you what I saw.  You killed anyone.  Even though there were probably 15 people in the room, in Anthony's eyes, there were just 
[02:32:00]  him and her.  Oh, was that it?  Everyone went away?  Oh, yeah.  They did.  It was just you two.  You guys...  He wants to do a remake of Grease starring him and Shawnee.  Oh, my God.  Shawnee.  It's unbelievable.  Riding around in your Mustang.  Yeah.  You assholes.  From the lovin' at the blast. 
[02:32:30]  I met a girl.  Her name was Shawnee.  Boy, he was creepy.  Anthony!  Kumiya!  You stink.  Well, well, well, well.  A lot of you guys not getting it.  Shawnee from Jersey.  I agree with that.  Shawnee is hot.  We all saw that she's hot.  We just saw some other things going on.  No one said she's not hot, stupid.  We saw some other things going on. 
[02:33:00]  There wasn't other things.  Spark, we're flying.  Yeah, I agree.  Like, you ever see somebody like that, mufflers dragging behind their car?  That's what was coming off of Anthony.  I talked to her when we went to break, while we were taking pictures, and before they left.  You were talking to the rug.  And then we took pictures.  I commented on a couple of things that I noticed that she looks a lot smaller in real life than she does in the movie. 
[02:33:30]  You didn't say that to, what was her name?  Honey?  Honey, yeah, you didn't say that.  Who, Honey?  You didn't ask her how Peter Jackson did it.  Anthony, bad news.  That's funny.  Bad news.  Let's just keep going on that.  Bad news, Shawnee's father is checking in.  Listen to me, my fine-feathered friend.  Wow.  Stay away from my daughter.  That guy goes way back.  That was a good call back. 
[02:34:00]  Oof.  Yeah, let's go to Dave in Paramus.  Dave.  Hey, yeah, somebody's got to get Anthony a flower so he can play She Loves Me, She Loves Me Not.  We just want to get her on the phone one more time for Anthony.  Why?  Because we know you want to.  There's no reason.  No.  Because we want to watch you get embarrassed again.  You guys are like fucking high school.  You're talking about me like high school.  You guys are high school.  I want to watch Anthony try to talk normal to a firm.  They're like, these guys.  They're just throwing me under the bus.  I don't like to be there.  Yeah, where's Roland?  I know he's at the office, but someone call him and say we need Shawnee to call the program. 
[02:34:30]  Roland's a busy man.  You let him do his work.  Anthony, promise me this.  Look at that.  He can't get up fast enough.  Hold on.  He's just another one of you fucking pricks.  Promise me this.  Promise everyone this.  What?  If we get her on the phone, you have to explain what's going on.  Yeah.  Why would I have to when all three of us can do it?  Oh, let Bill Burr do it so eloquently.  Anthony, you can even deny it.  That's fine, but you just tell her what has been going on since she left.  That's all.  That's all.  You'll explain it at least from your point of view. 
[02:35:00]  I could do that because it will make you guys look ridiculous.  That's fair enough.  All right.  It will.  It would be my pleasure.  We have to get her now.  We have to get her.  And we're getting clipped to the interview.  See if I care.  We're getting clipped to the interview.  It doesn't matter one way or the other.  Get her on the phone or don't.  It doesn't matter to me.  I don't even like her.  It's the way I roll.  Yeah.  I didn't even notice.  I didn't even notice her in the room.  Absolutely smitten.  It was cute.  It was.  It was. 
[02:35:30]  Bill, of course.  Absolutely smitten.  Anthony's shy.  Yeah, he's shy.  He gets shy.  So this whole shock jock thing is just this big persona that he puts up to hide the fact  that he's really a sensitive human being.  He's a shy jock.  Mark Cuban's calling in today?  Is he?  Yeah, I guess.  All right.  Whatever.  We might have to blow him off.  That's sweet.  Well, it depends how this goes.  We got to get Sean here.  Get her on the phone. 
[02:36:00]  There's Roland right there.  Roland!  He's trying.  Oh, correct.  Oh, he's trying.  We're going to get her?  What?  She's doing, like, a ton of interviews back-to-back right now.  See?  They're very busy.  We might be able to get her in tomorrow.  No, no, no.  Why?  No.  There's no reason for this.  We need a phone call from Shawnee.  It's great publicity for this.  No, it's not Shawnee.  It's Shawnee.  Shawnee.  Great.  Paul McCartney's a wife-beater.  This Heather Mills.  Now she's claiming that he beat Linda, too. 
[02:36:30]  Her father said she's a compulsive liar.  Oh, really?  Her father's side with McCartney.  Nice.  He said she said the same things about me.  She just doesn't know the truth, and she doesn't know reality.  She's a one-legged gold digger.  You look like you have two legs in pants.  So Ian knows.  Yeah.  He knows what voice he used.  I didn't use that voice.  I'm imitating Jimmy.  I'm imitating this fucking imaginary guy.  If she was Heather Mills, that's what you'd say when you saw her stump leg.  You wouldn't realize.  You'd go, your leg looks so much smaller in person. 
[02:37:00]  I didn't say that like that.  Oh, I get it.  You know, when you wear pants, it looks like a real leg.  It's okay that you can do so many more sexual positions.  I like the metallic clunk.  No, it's not about sex.  It's a crush.  Oh, that's right.  That's right.  He wants to, like, drink, you know, like, ice cream sodas and stuff.  He wants to lay in a fucking wheat field.  Yeah, he wants to be in, like, about his stuff.  I play an air hockey game.  Yeah, a little air hockey.  She's huggable.  She's huggable.  No, he just wants a make-out session.  That's all.  What?  He doesn't want sex.  He wants to kiss her in the cheek. 
[02:37:30]  She wants something he didn't get in high school.  This is a high school crush.  Yes, it is.  You guys are showing more about yourselves than you're ever showing about me.  Yeah, keep telling yourself.  You are showing more about your own wants and needs.  I know you are, but what am I?  Are we member and are you blue?  Whatever you say bounces off of me.  All right, hold on.  Drew in Texas.  Drew?  Maybe Shawnee will LARP with you.  Oh, you want to LARP with her?  I don't LARP.  Too damaged. 
[02:38:00]  There's no LARPing.  I won't be LARPing.  She did a 10 damage to my heart.  Oh, fucking idiot.  He wants to cast a love spell with his bean bag.  Hey, we got an Anthony clip?  All right, let's...  Oh, no.  See, now this is going to be out of context.  I love they titled your clips and creeps Shawnee out number one.  Shut the fuck up. 
[02:38:30]  Which one are we going?  This one?  All right, here we go.  I've pretty much seen everything she's done.  I've been a huge fan.  You don't pop on...  You must be a freak.  I am.  You don't pop on the screen once where I don't go, oh, it's Julie Lowry.  Oh, it's Julie Lowry.  It's always Julie Lowry.  Oh, it's Julie Lowry.  See, it sounded just like Jimmy's impression.  Absolutely.  No, that was...  No, I didn't do the voice there.  But it was the beginning.  Yeah, because I never did the voice.  You were still hiding behind the mic.  Yeah.  It's when you got off air and all of a sudden it was just you and you weren't the shock jock anymore. 
[02:39:00]  That's when the shoulders came up.  You were shy, Anthony, handing her a wooden S that you had shellacked.  Shawnee, what you want to do?  No.  I think I'm in love with you.  All right, we got another clip?  Yeah.  For a while.  Ann explains Fatty Pig Fatty to Shawnee.  I thought you guys were, you know, like... 
[02:39:30]  It's $10 a pound contract.  I'm feeling very...  No, wait, wait, wait.  Anthony, tell Shawnee what the name of the contest is.  It's the $10...  Mr. Nice Guy.  It's the $10 pound contract.  It's the $10 pound contract.  Come on.  I want to...  He's all frozen, right?  I can't say.  Just say.  Shawnee, he'll listen to you.  Go, Anthony.  We have to look at it, though.  Go, Anthony.  What's the name of the contest?  Anthony, look me in the eyes and say the name.  It's called the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest.  You should be ashamed.  I know. 
[02:40:00]  I'm going to call your mother.  Fatty Pig Fatty.  That clip says a lot, man.  It sure does.  That's just the fact that they had just come in, and I didn't want to alienate...  Look me in the eye.  I didn't want to alienate the guests if perhaps any of them have some fat people in their family  or close friends.  So I didn't want to alienate them right from the...  That's a very considerate thought.  I'm very considerate.  I am considerate.  You don't consider the families of eight patients. 
[02:40:30]  You know that we've been talking about this for an hour?  Just about an hour.  Only an hour?  It seems like fucking five to me.  They left around 8.30, 8.35.  Scott in Oklahoma, what's up?  Hey, Ed, at least you don't have a crush on Florida Evans.  All right, listen.  That's helpful.  And listen, let me tell you.  Florida Evans.  I have to bring this up every day for a month to even come close to the abuse I took for that.  Well, it's Florida Evans.  Fuck you expect. 
[02:41:00]  I meant to say Thelma.  I don't care what you meant.  All right.  Get Shoney on the phone.  We don't need.  There's no need.  All right.  We're going to take...  They're very busy.  They're very busy.  Oh, and look.  They're finding pictures of Shawnee for you.  Let me see one.  She's adorable.  He already has all of those.  Take to his wall.  How is she?  Your guys are jackasses.  I bet Anthony has like a shed or something in the back.  No one else is allowed in. 
[02:41:30]  And we're...  I don't have a shed.  And let's all be honest here.  We're very surprised because she's twice the age of your normal, you know, crush.  Well, she looks very young.  What, 15?  I think she's like 36 or so.  Is she?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Born in 1970?  Somewhere around there.  I do believe.  Like I think I saw in the bio?  Yeah.  That everybody got?  All right.  Please.  I wouldn't have remembered that.  That was all of it.  1970.  She just turned 36 in July.  She looks great. 
[02:42:00]  All right.  Of course she does.  Oh, oh, oh.  Was she the girl you used to think about when you were installing air conditioners?  Would you stop it?  Hotline's ringing.  Hotline's ringing.  Please.  Please.  I'm not.  Uh-oh.  What is this?  Hello?  Hello.  Hello?  Hello.  Hello.  Hey, who's this?  This is Adam with Lionsgate.  How are you?  Good, Adam.  We're trying to find Shawnee Smith. 
[02:42:30]  I know.  I'm trying to get her for you guys.  Can I talk to Roland for a second?  Sure.  I'm going to put you back on hold.  Well, basically, Anthony has a crush on her.  And if you want promotion for Saw III, that would be great if you could call our show.  Hold on a minute.  Why are you telling me so much?  He just wants to want to.  He probably wants to know, like, look, Shawnee is uncomfortable.  Is he the guy that was sitting closest to her?  Yeah.  No.  That's just because the guest chair, the couch, is right where I am. 
[02:43:00]  That's right now.  That's what he's saying to Roland.  What does he want?  You told us to rearrange the whole studio so you could be sitting next to her.  Oh, my God.  I didn't think anything.  He could never fully turn around.  Did you notice anything?  Yeah, I just thought you were a fan of the Saw movies.  He kind of peeked over his shoulder.  I think it's sweet.  I honestly do.  I don't think that's what I've been saying.  He's trying to attack me.  It got all small, though.  Who brought it up that his shoulders were way up in the air and his hands were like this?  I couldn't see his ears when he was talking to us.  Yeah. 
[02:43:30]  I'm like, I'm ready to tap out here.  I am so ready to tap out.  You can.  You got to play this out.  I am so ready to tap.  You got to play this out.  I can't.  If she would have kissed him on the cheek, he would have teared up.  He would have teared up.  He would have not.  He would have fainted.  All right.  We got an update from Roland.  We got an update from Roland.  Once she's done with her interview, she's going to call in.  Oh.  They're making it happen.  Why?  They asked if you could play her song, too, Lionsgate.  Tell her.  Call them back.  Can I just tap out?  And tell them if Shawnee calls this program and talks to Ann, we'll do whatever they want. 
[02:44:00]  He's making it happen right now.  They're wrapping her up early.  Oh, this is going to be great.  There's no.  Somebody's doing an interview and they're wrapping it up.  There's really no reason for this.  She thinks they have to go, but they're just going to call in.  Hey, Anthony, it sure is cold outside, huh?  Yeah.  Hi, Shawnee.  Are you warm?  Should we take a break or should we?  They don't know exactly, though, but they said they're going to call in.  All right.  Let's take a quick break.  We try to, and when we get back, hopefully we'll have Shawnee Smith on the line.  That's what you always dreamed of, Anthony. 
[02:44:30]  One-on-one conversation.  Drive down some stuff to talk to her about.  Anthony, she's calling you.  This is like, I got to go home.  We are grown men and we're in high school right now.  I want to go home right now.  That high school thing where you're like, oh, my God, you got her to call me?  He's getting, like, nauseous.  You know, when you were younger, when you were in love, you would actually get nauseous.  He's not a radio star right now.  He's outside a wood shop with his flannel and his army jacket smoking a Marlboro.  He's smoking a Marlboro outside a wood shop right now.  I can't. 
[02:45:00]  Trying to, like, concentrate with his burnout friends.  He is.  Look at him.  He's not in showbiz anymore.  Look at him.  Can I tap out of this bitch?  No, it's okay.  What's this?  Anthony.  We're behind you.  1974, September.  74, 1954.  I wasn't in cutoff, this guy.  We have no idea.  It was 1978.  Nine.  All right.  He ran for senator in 78.  All right.  Let's take a quick break. 
[02:45:30]  Hopefully, we'll figure all this out after we rest for a minute or two or whatever.  Just hit that damn thing.  You're listening to the suing sounds of Opie and Anthony.  So sit back, relax, have yourself some herbal tea, close your eyes, and drift away with O&A.  Hey, ass pop.  Hi.  This is great.  You dick.  Bye, aye, aye.  Shut up. 
[02:46:00]  Shut up.  Fuck all y'all.  Horrific and tasteless.  Tasteless.  It's called sarcasm.  I've never heard anything as offensive and gross as you are.  And that's why I'm signing up.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You are so beautiful. 
[02:46:30]  To me.  Welcome back to the Opie and Anthony Show.  You are so beautiful.  A very special episode.  Anthony's writing an emo song as we speak.  Thank you, garbage dick.  Bye, too.  Can't you see...  I like how much work is being put into this.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I'm honored.  Yeah.  How much work is being put into this.  Do people work in the phones?  Publicists. 
[02:47:00]  Fucking...  Uh...  Roland's running around like a maniac trying to get in touch with publicity people.  Anthony Cumia.  The woodshop years.  The wonder years.  She can't plan if she likes smoke.  You are so beautiful.  It's slow motion.  Huh?  Everything is in slow motion in this video.  And then I was saying...  I'm saying how Billy is the worst...  Yeah, absolutely.  ...out of it.  We all know that.  Anthony, I'm on your side.  And I get a text from my girlfriend that says,  Billy has you totally down. 
[02:47:30]  Says, Billy has you red 100%.  In what way?  Son of a bitch.  In what way, though?  Like, just has it down.  I don't know.  Whatever he's been saying.  It's not hard to see when somebody brings their shoulders...  I sound like a chipmunk.  I did not sound like a chipmunk.  Because you...  I did not sound like a chipmunk.  Your girlfriend was confirming that when you're in love, you turn into a Nancy. 
[02:48:00]  I am not a Nancy.  A chipmunk.  My voice didn't make that fucking Jim Norton imitation of...  I don't know who that is.  We don't even know what Saw 3 is about now.  We didn't even have time to ask about the movie.  It's a love story.  I don't know, but Anthony wants to rescue Shawnee.  I'll come and save you.  Cut off my leg instead.  Did I ever sound like that?  Can we please be honest here for a second?  Even in the midst of this, did I ever sound like this? 
[02:48:30]  Listen, all comedy is based in a truth.  And this is a slight exaggeration.  Slight.  When we went to commercials, how you said tiny, that was it.  That was it for us.  A lot of whispering going on.  I was talking.  I was just talking to her, and I said she looked tinier in person.  I said, you're so tiny in person.  That's exactly how you said it.  I said, you're so tiny in person.  Hold on.  Let's listen in.  We got a clip.  Ant smothers, then creeps out Shawnee. 
[02:49:00]  Shawnee, you started so young.  How did you get into acting?  How did you do?  Commercials?  Yeah, commercials.  Yeah.  There was a girl on the street who did the northern toilet paper.  Northern toilet paper?  You did a toilet paper commercial?  No, the girl up the street did.  Bitch.  And unfortunately, we went for walks around the block.  My mom talked to her mom.  Got my mom's panties all in a bunch about, you know, my daughter could do that.  And so the next thing I know, she's got me on with the camera, taking pictures, and 
[02:49:30]  send it to the agency, and then I'm on a McDonald's commercial.  Yeah, you make it sound so easy.  Yeah.  And then you were like, just, you know, kind of watched you grow up every so often.  It's like, hey, there she is.  Yeah.  I remember her from that last movie.  She was a little younger in the last movie.  Have you been stalking her?  Yeah, totally.  A little creepy.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Mm-hmm.  Then I had to go in for the whole, you know, you're stalking her thing.  So I had to jump on that.  See, now this stuff is prior to you going, you look so much smaller in your movies. 
[02:50:00]  So we were already seeing it.  We heard it.  We saw it.  You're assholes.  That's what it is.  You didn't see or hear or know or do or anything.  This delusion, this mass hysteria that you guys have conjured up between yourselves.  Anthony, you're among friends.  Everybody here likes you.  Shut up, Bill.  Here we go.  Ann creeps Shawnee out.  Why is it always Ann creeps Shawnee out? 
[02:50:30]  This one is, he notices her hair color change.  What?  Absolutely.  It's one of my faves.  Yeah.  Pops up in movies all the time.  Overnight success with the Saw movies.  Yeah.  Very cool.  I'm dirt.  Two decades.  Oh, please.  Love it.  I'm sure people are constantly like, you get recognized a lot, don't you?  Not a lot.  Really?  Not a lot.  Really?  I would.  People recognize me more when they hear me speak than looking at me.  Yeah?  Because, you know, I don't always have this.  Different color hair.  Yeah.  Just all rocked out today. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, I glammed up for you guys.  You glammed.  Fantastic.  Thank you.  Yeah, she said she doesn't get recognized, and you said I would.  She gets recognized.  I would recognize her.  And I bet she gets recognized a lot.  You must get recognized all the time.  I bet she does.  I bet she does.  She's very recognizable.  I know.  If I saw you walking down the street, I would have recognized you.  Who's this voice now?  I would have said, hey, Shawnee.  You want to ride in my car?  This isn't like the normal Mustang. 
[02:51:30]  This is the super, super Mustang, and I could drive really fast, and maybe we could get a  Walt.  You think he could do that, Shawnee?  And here's what Anthony's doing.  Give himself away.  He's answering her too much.  Everything she said, he's like, yes, mm-hmm, okay, yeah, yeah.  Oh, like you did with your love, Ozzy?  Yes.  Shut up.  That's an excellent example.  Or Gene Simmons when he comes in here?  Yeah, and see how Jim admits it?  He would just admit it.  So you're in love with these people? 
[02:52:00]  No, you want to date them.  It's a loving feeling.  Oh, then, no, no.  You are taken with them as a celebrity, as somebody that you appreciate.  Look at the walls.  It's beyond that.  It's beyond that.  And then Bill Burwell, I'm trying to explain, will throw a torpedo into the side of my fucking  ship.  Because you're building walls around yourself.  I'm not building walls.  I'm showing that it's just what it's been.  Jim is a very open person.  It's a mutual, professional respect.  He admits to his love, to Ozzy, if you would just, you know.  It's about, it's, here's what it is. 
[02:52:30]  Because you, like, she was saying, oh, yeah, yeah.  Like, anything, just let her know.  Like, I'm still engaged.  I'm right here with you.  You're a little motherfucker.  I'm active listening.  Excellent way to put it, Bill.  I'm right here with you.  Active listening.  You wanted to keep that role.  You fucking psychobabble douchebag.  He's right, though.  He's right.  That's, um, what you're doing there is active listening.  Yeah, right.  Okay.  It's completely what you're doing.  Oh, shit.  I wish I had 10,000 people from Philly here today.  How'd you get that?  You fucking scumbag.  How'd you get started?  Commercials?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:53:00]  Anything just to keep that role taut.  No, no, no, no.  Keep it taut.  Then he's just like, you did commercials?  And his head, oh, she's so much bigger than commercials.  He just went, Breck.  Yeah, that's exactly, Breck is a goof because it's a product that was probably advertised  when she was starting out.  You liked her hair, though.  You wanted to come in and talk about her hair.  She had very nice hair.  He doesn't like this picture because they made her look like a dirty girl.  Oh, yeah, I said that.  They made her look like a dirty girl.  That's what I say.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, somebody handed it to you.  You barely even looked at it.  You looked at it.  You had to look at it.  You handed it to me, Billy. 
[02:53:30]  You handed it to me.  Why don't you start humming a Jay Giles song now?  Hey, let's go to TJ the trucker.  TJ.  Yeah, what's up, boys?  Hey, you got that wrangler.  You got your two horses packed up ready to go to the mountain?  Boy, they remember.  Yeah.  They sure remember.  Ant, do you have to pee-pee before she calls in?  Later, boys.  You guys are just scumbags.  By the way, I can't take credit for that.  Where is that one? 
[02:54:00]  Bill in Boston.  Thanks, Bill.  All right.  Well, we can talk about Harry Potter as we wait for Shawnee to call in.  Actor Daniel Radcliffe is 17 years old now and anxious to prove he can play other roles  besides Harry Potter.  He'll take to the stage in Equus in London next summer and get this, he'll even perform  nude in one scene as that play requires, according to Newsweek.  Oh, Harry Potter, nude.  Active listening there for Jimmy on that one?  Harry Potter, nude. 
[02:54:30]  That's going to be his showgirls.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  I gotcha.  All right.  I'm with you on that one.  What was her name?  See, it's just not as good as making fun of Anthony.  Elizabeth Berkley?  Elizabeth Berkley?  It's the end.  I try to move on, but, you know, that's not going to happen.  No, no.  Let's get right back.  Trying to move on.  Please.  Just trying to move on.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  It's just not going to, it's like fucking wild dogs, a pack of wild dogs.  There's no moving on. 
[02:55:00]  We can't do anything else until we have an ending here, that's all.  We're going to tear apart whatever they're working on until it's done, and that's what  you guys do.  You just got distracted by something.  Why don't you tell us something?  By some headlights.  You looked away for a second, and now it's back to the fucking bleeding carcass.  That is me.  Do you know any other fun-filled personal facts about Shawnee?  Yeah, come on.  Favorite color?  Favorite?  No.  I must say, I don't know any.  What was your favorite role?  As you watched her grow up, Anthony.  Yes.  As I watched her grow up. 
[02:55:30]  As you watched her grow up from afar.  From afar.  What were some of your favorite roles?  Well, I liked Stephen King's The Stand.  What was her name?  That was the Julie Lowry part.  In The Stand.  Played some crazy kind of wild girl.  Ran off to Vegas.  What did she do after that?  And went to the evil side of the people that were still alive.  Yeah, they were bad. 
[02:56:00]  A lot of people were dead because of the super flu.  Yes.  What song would you play for, if you could?  I don't have a song.  I don't have any song to pick, because I don't know what you would be looking for.  A song.  Will you fantasize about riding bicycles together?  There is no fantasy about riding bicycles together.  What the fuck are you even...  Wait, wait, wait.  Are you insane?  David Cassidy.  Why would I be riding bicycles with...  I can see that.  Eric in Jersey. 
[02:56:30]  Eric.  Shawnee, you had me at hello.  Fuck yourself, Eric.  You complete me?  Jim in New Brunswick.  Hold on a minute.  Okay.  Ann's going to bring her up to the treehouse, and she'll be going...  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  Oh, my God.  As he whispers, can I brush your hair?  I'll brush your hair if you want. 
[02:57:00]  Man, you know, it's just no fucking slip in this one.  A lot on the hair.  DJ in a light bulb from posthorrors.net.  Anthony just wants to brush her hair and whisper, the Jews control the media.  The Jews control the media.  Yeah.  Are you going to be double dating with Fezzy and your sister?  Yeah, because that's about as imaginary as this relationship is.  Is it?  Yes.  Too good to be true.  Too good to be true.  Yeah, that's it, Jimmy. 
[02:57:30]  I can't keep deflecting.  I don't know what to do anymore.  I might just have to leave.  You know what you have to do is you have to let the walls down.  Yeah.  And you just have to give in.  You know, just...  You saw Jimmy do it.  Try it.  People can do this.  I was being honest.  I said, I'm a fan, and she's very pretty.  Just the way his hands are up, it's like he's holding people back.  I said, I'm a fan, and she's a pretty girl.  Anthony...  What else?  Believe it or not, oh, wow, they're already...  Oh, that's the funny picture of... 
[02:58:00]  Yes.  Look at that smile.  I got to see.  I got a big, goofy smile.  Oh, would you look at that smile?  Because...  This is a man in love.  No.  Look how freaked out she looks.  Look at him like, oh, my God, look at this psycho.  She was making me laugh, and she was looking at me and saying something about, do you want  the smiling picture or the...  I'm not even going to try to explain it anymore.  It's because it's not working.  I can't make this work anymore. 
[02:58:30]  This is not about brilliant Anthony, the great comic mind, or the technical brilliant Anthony.  This is about...  This is shy Anthony.  This is her Anthony.  This is over, Johnny.  This is okay.  This is...  I'm done.  This is...  I just want to hug Anthony.  You can't tap down.  I've tapped down.  I'm tapping your...  This is the face of a man.  That's true love right there.  Yeah.  Look at his face.  Dude, we're just doing filler until she calls.  No, it's not.  Anthony, I'm going to tell you something.  Someone was making me laugh.  I've known you for a little over a year now.  I've never seen you beaming. 
[02:59:00]  You were beaming in that photo.  I got...  What about when Mila Jovovich was here?  We were just as bubbly and fun.  No, you were on...  That was much different.  You were interviewing her.  It was a great interview, but you were doing the Russian impression.  It was back and forth.  It was really fast-paced.  It was...  You were on your game, and you were...  It had to be a difference.  It's not that you were off your game with this girl, but there was emotions with this.  You weren't trying to be funny.  You were just being...  This was...  Again, this was...  You were being shy.  This was shy. 
[02:59:30]  This was...  I'm only a junior.  I'm only a junior.  She'll never go out with me.  All right, tell Iraq, Iraq, put the other picture up, too, just to show that that one  was the fluke picture.  What other picture?  That's not a fluke.  I thought he purposely put that up.  There's no other picture.  Put the other picture, Iraq.  Anthony, you can't fake that emotion.  There ain't no fucking bosses here, motherfucker.  There's no...  Put that other picture up.  There's no other picture.  I can fire you just as easily.  As the guy that fires everybody does.  What?  Look, I'm trying to deflect.  What? 
[03:00:00]  Look at the anger.  You weren't supposed to know that.  What?  I'm just trying to deflect.  What?  Look at that big smile.  That was...  Somebody was saying something.  I've never laughed that hard.  I laughed that hard at prior.  I didn't laugh that hard.  Shut up.  You can't...  You know what?  You can't fake that emotion.  You cannot fake that emotion.  You can't fake that.  You ever tried to do that with somebody?  It doesn't happen.  It never works.  That's your Julia Roberts smile.  No.  Pretty woman.  I'm just kidding.  Oh, his heart skipped a beat.  His heart skipped a beat.  Because I had to get ready for the beating I'm going to take. 
[03:00:30]  You scared the shit out of me, you asshole.  Look, Shawnee had just said something there.  Yeah.  And that's why she's looking like that.  And that's why I'm laughing.  Know what she's saying?  No.  That's beyond laughing.  She said something, and that picture got taken at what?  She goes, I'm not wearing any panties.  Don't make her dirty, Opie.  Don't make her dirty.  She's not dirty.  I'm sorry.  Hey, I got audio of Anthony.  He knows he blew it.  This is audio from his car on his way home from the show today. 
[03:01:00]  What?  Yeah.  Just you talking to yourself, and we happen to get the audio of you going home.  In the future?  Yes.  In the future.  Oh, fuck it's idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot. 
[03:01:30]  I'm a fucking idiot.  What a great scene that is.  You have another clip?  You fucking suck, man.  No, we have another clip.  This one's called Ant Sucking Up.  Of course you do.  Ant Sucking Up to Shawnee.  Of course.  I just saw Shawnee in Desperate Hours.  I was clicking through with Sir Anthony Hopkins.  Sir Anthony Hopkins.  That must have been something.  That was quite a set, I'll tell you.  You were a little kid in that one.  Michael Cermino and Mickey Rourke to start there. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, Mickey Rourke.  That was a good movie.  It was.  All right.  Anthony Hopkins and Mickey Rourke are in the fucking movie, too.  By the way.  Yeah.  It's a good movie.  Mississippi Burning was a good movie.  You didn't get that excited with Tobin Bell.  No, because you jumped on his dick about that the second he fucking didn't even sit down yet.  You hadn't even sat down and you're like, ah, Mississippi Burning.  I certainly did.  You were just a kid.  You were just a kid in that one.  Well, she was, I'm trying to convey how long she's been, you know.  How long your love for her is. 
[03:02:30]  No, no.  That she's been in movies since she was.  Aw.  Why don't you just tell Natalie Portman you've been jerking off to her since the professional.  We have maybe the final clip for now.  Isn't that the only movie you need?  Here's a clip called Embarrassed Ant.  Ant thinks he's noble.  You guys lost Tobin about 30 seconds ago.  I get all embarrassed of this program sometimes for what I do for a living.  I really get embarrassed of what I do for a living. 
[03:03:00]  You're getting shy in front of the beautiful girl here, Sean.  You couldn't say what you really want to say to honey.  All right.  What's the most noble thing you've ever done on this radio show?  Noble?  I don't think it's ever even been spoken.  No?  It's so noble that I've kept it to myself.  You're noble on the inside.  Yeah.  Yeah.  His head is like, oh my God, she really does like me.  No matter what she said, he would have said, yeah, it didn't matter.  It's how he answered her. 
[03:03:30]  Andy, she's a beautiful woman.  There's nothing wrong with feeling like this for somebody.  She's just the one.  We're just waiting for her to call.  Yeah.  Tim, I hope she just doesn't call and ruins all your little fucking fun for the day.  It'd be just like high school, wouldn't it?  I remember those days, too.  Oh, I hope she doesn't call and ruins all your fun.  Let's go to Tim.  Tim, Seattle.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Sean.  I wish I knew how to quit you. 
[03:04:00]  Douchebag.  Hey, E-Rock, did you get that other picture up?  There's no other picture.  Did you get that other picture up?  There's no other picture, right?  Did you get that other picture up?  There's no other picture, right?  The site is being slammed.  I can't get in.  You fucking liar.  Yeah, I see.  You lying sack of shit.  See what happens.  Post it on a message board.  Yeah.  And they will get a hold of it and distribute it.  No.  No.  Yes.  Yes.  No.  Yes.  Yes.  Anthony, there's no reason to be hot.  There's no other picture where she's looking forward. 
[03:04:30]  I'm looking forward.  We're both smiling.  It's a normal picture.  This one, she's looking.  She just said something.  It made me laugh.  That's why I look like that.  Anthony, it's okay to have feelings for someone.  Yeah.  There's nothing.  Let's go to Mike in Jersey.  Mike.  Hey, guys.  It's an innocent crush.  We know you have a girlfriend, but we saw a little thing.  We saw a thing.  We saw a thing there.  Look, look.  There's a twinkle in his eye.  Yeah, a little twinkle.  A little Jimmy Cricket.  Mike in Jersey.  There's nothing.  Hey, guys.  Hey. 
[03:05:00]  Hey, Anthony.  We go home tonight, bake a cake, leave it on our doorstep, ring the bell, and run.  Drink it.  I'll have to build you a cake.  A cake.  All right.  Well, what are we...  We're just waiting for the call.  Should we take another break?  Yeah, say good.  I hope it wrecks the show now.  This has been one of my favorite shows I've ever been on.  Because all you guys are having so much fun, aren't you?  By the way, woman...  Aren't you?  Would you let her wear your sweatshirt on a cold day like this?  He'd offer it to her.  Are you kidding me?  He would actually just take it and put it around her shoulders while she was walking, 
[03:05:30]  and she'd be like, all right, thanks.  Try to give her that behind-the-back hug.  Wouldn't that be a polite thing to do to any body that...  Yeah?  Yeah.  If Patty was cold, you'd put your sweatshirt around her?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Around her neck with the sleeves and pull it real tight.  What about Honey, the new leader in the Fatty Pig Fat Contest?  No.  Would you take the cover of your Mustang and throw it on her?  I needed 20 gallons of water when I wrung it out.  Let's go to Patrick in Mississippi.  Just something for you to think about as we go to break in.  All right.  Patrick? 
[03:06:00]  Hey, Opie.  What if just for chance she calls and says,  Anthony, I like you, but not in that way?  There's not going to be any asking out.  There's not going to be any, do you like me?  I like you.  There's not going to be any of that during this phone call.  It's not like that.  He won't even let himself believe it.  No.  That's that whole buzzer thing.  All right, Phil.  No.  No.  Is there a couch?  You wouldn't want to go out with me.  Excuse me.  Dr. Burr, can I lay down on this couch and perhaps you can psychoanalyze me? 
[03:06:30]  Dr. Burr, where did you go to school for your psychiatrist fucking degree?  Dr. Funny Fucking Funny Man?  You're showing a lot of anger right now.  Yeah, why the anger?  Oh, is that it?  You want to write it down on your little pad, Dr. Burr?  It's misdirected anger at myself because you have, when you were young, they made you feel  like love was a bad emotion to feel and it's creating hostility.  Who's this they?  The people you grew up with.  The people who hurt you.  Who's this they?  Do you know what Anthony Watts said but he should never like little old me? 
[03:07:00]  Spin that around.  Let me see that.  Wait, I'm just, don't worry, and only four people have viewed the picture so far.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Um, as it tries to update.  Oh my god, I've never.  Yeah, I'm sure that won't be photoshopped either.  I've never seen this website.  Oh, I'm sure the whack baggers won't photoshop the shit out of that picture.  I've never seen this website slam so, so badly as today.  We can't even update the page.  Oh my god, we can't. 
[03:07:30]  I'm not even kidding.  Dude.  Hey, you know something?  If you guys gotta make jokes about this, good, go ahead.  Make jokes.  Yeah, oh boy, I'm such an asshole.  Oh, what a slob.  What a slob she is.  He is literally imploding right now.  We gave you a chance to admit it.  You just didn't want to admit it.  That's all.  Good.  See, it's only been viewed four times.  What?  I have four.  Four D-thousand?  All right, well.  Oh, let me see what kind of a lunatic I look like in that.  You look really happy.  Oh, Jesus Christ. 
[03:08:00]  That is like, I look like a lunatic.  You look really happy.  But she's gazing into your eyes.  You want to go, bleep, bleep, bleep.  She said something right there that made me laugh, and she was still looking at me.  And then right after that, she turned and looked at the camera, and it was a normal picture.  Anthony, she could have said anything.  You would have had that look on your face.  Asshole.  She should have said, who's this fucking gooey?  Who's this redhead guy that I should kill?  Anthony, we haven't done it in a while.  How about a little caption contest? 
[03:08:30]  Are we up for a caption contest?  The picture's up on opiananthony.com.  If you feel a caption contest, it'd be something that would be good for the show.  Because I'm all for the show.  That's why I get up in the morning and come here.  It's for the show.  What'd she say that made you laugh?  What good joke did she tell you?  I don't remember, Jim.  I don't fucking remember.  You have a flawless memory.  If I remembered, do you think looking into your fucking vicious eyes that want to rip me 
[03:09:00]  apart with that innocent look?  But it might be, actually, you're a little toy collie with a pit bull temperament.  No, no, but it might be something that gets you off the hook, because maybe she says something  genuinely funny, and that would explain the laugh.  Don't even try.  What am I, a caller, you fucking dick?  What am I, a caller?  You're treating me like a fucking bitch caller.  You ever watch the Discovery Channel?  Maybe it's the...  You ever watch the Discovery Channel, and some other animal will corner a badger?  That's what he is right now.  He'll come right out of a little tree stump. 
[03:09:30]  I want to bite you in the face.  Anthony, I've been studying the picture.  I know what she said to you.  What?  I love Nazis, too.  That is not...  You know, that's wrong on two levels.  What happened?  Uh, she wouldn't have said anything like that, and I am not into Nazis.  Mm-hmm.  I'm not into Nazis.  Mm-hmm.  I like the era of the World War II era.  You're not into what?  I am not into Nazis.  Yeah, keep repeating yourself.  That's...  Because that's what people do when they're... 
[03:10:00]  Why?  What if I really am not?  You're telling the truth.  I should say that I am?  What are the rules here?  How do you play the rules here?  Once with confidence would have done it.  This is like a maze, this fucking show.  There's no getting out.  You're never going to find true happiness unless you give in to what your soul really wants.  Okay, Dr. Burr.  And you're lashing out at all of us who are just trying to help you.  Yeah, man.  What's up with that?  What degree?  What degree?  What college did you go to?  What shithole in Massachusetts threw you the fuck out so you got to talk to his jokes? 
[03:10:30]  That's right.  What?  Very, very hostile.  Yeah, man.  Chill.  And then he doesn't even get mad.  He's just very...  As you see the subject here, he detaches himself that it's even me.  Chill, man.  He doesn't even...  It's not even me anymore.  He's like...  Okay, okay, Anthony...  All right, gallery.  Gallery, look at this subject now.  Take your medications.  Time for your medication.  Chill, man.  We're all friends here.  I need my L-Dopa.  We're all friends here.  Relax.  Jesus.  Do you have some easy listening music that we can maybe play and just kind of calm him down? 
[03:11:00]  Get him a little more open?  All right.  Guys, should we take a break?  Yeah.  He's shy.  He doesn't call.  Huh?  I hope she calls and has a minute right when we go to break.  I only have a minute.  Aha, we're in break.  Oh, we'll stop the master computer.  No, we won't.  You watch what we do.  Can't do that.  That's not what you really hope.  Shawnee Smith, the girl that Anthony has a crush on, will be calling the show in minutes, hopefully.  They're practicing being cruel and unusual. 
[03:11:30]  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Don't go changing to try and please me.  Assholes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Never let me down before.  Yeah.  Shawnee, you want to go for a ride?  Don't imagine, you're too familiar, and I don't see you anymore. 
[03:12:00]  You know, shut this up.  Anthony's going to start crying.  I would not need you.  I've never seen him type faster in my life.  It's a bit.  I'm telling you, it's a bit, really.  It's a bit.  It's a bit.  No, what are you kidding?  It's a bit.  No, my own girlfriend's totally selling me out.  She goes, because I said, I'm getting slammed, and it's not stopping. 
[03:12:30]  And she goes, because it's too true.  Yeah.  So, for the love of God, listen to the music, Anthony.  And so, let the walls come down.  The music of Billy Joel.  Well, you can sing, man.  You have a good voice.  Thank you, Jimmy.  What song would you sing to me if you could sing one?  I knew that wasn't just a compliment in passing.  I don't think I would be singing any songs.  No?  Yeah.  Would you make up an original?  No, no, no.  I'm not a good songwriter. 
[03:13:00]  I don't write songs.  I got a song for you.  Do we have the song I picked out for Anthony?  All right.  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  That's it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  What happened?  The keyboard is the instrument to convey his love.  Yeah.  The raindrop setting on the Casio.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:13:30]  Oh, yeah.  People are saying I have to ask Master Poe what the proper song to sing is.  Anthony, you ought to handle this situation smooth.  If I'm leaving, I must be on my way.  Just take it to F.H. Reilly's parking lot.  The time is drawing in.  This is the song as she was walking away after the interview.  He just stood there staring at her as she left the studio.  Yeah.  That's what this is, Bill. 
[03:14:00]  You got me.  That's the first step.  It's just admitting.  You're hiding your face.  You're very childlike right now.  This fuck from Cleveland could go shit in a hat.  George.  George.  Yes, sir.  Yes.  What would you like to say?  Oh, yeah.  I got to call you out, man. 
[03:14:30]  You're a backpedaling little bitch.  You gave Jimmy all that shit when he had his little crush on Kate.  And now you can't take the ribbon, brother?  Crush on Kate?  Oh, come on now.  Why does everyone on Paltalk have, like, hearts falling from the sky?  Yeah, they're all hearts falling from the sky graphic.  And he's saying I can dish it out but can't take it.  I've been taking it for an hour and a half.  Dude, come on, dude.  Oh, sorry, sorry.  Anthony's taking it.  Here's what it is.  He doesn't like the fact that it's just hitting him a little bit because he's like, he's not just Anthony now. 
[03:15:00]  He's the younger Anthony.  Oh, here it is.  When meeting that girl is younger Anthony.  Dr. Burr's protege, Dr. Norton.  That's common sense, though, man.  Watching you with that girl is watching younger Anthony.  And in all fairness, we don't beat bits into the ground anymore.  Yeah.  We're just waiting for her to call.  That's it.  Or we would have moved on.  You know that.  You know that.  We want to make your dream come true.  Even though I know this is my show also.  Why don't we get some sex advice from Sue Johansson.  Oh. 
[03:15:30]  Sue Johansson.  Oh, boy.  Maybe not.  I want to know what song you'd sing to her.  I don't have a song.  He couldn't even look at her as he sang either.  He'd just be looking down at the shag rug.  You know what he'd do?  He'd close his eyes and sing, not looking at her, but hoping she would understand that  he was singing to her.  She would hear the lyrics and know that he meant it for her.  He just can't get out of this.  I know.  She's like in a bar with another guy. 
[03:16:00]  He just can't let the walls down to say how he really feels, so he just goes up there.  What are you making up?  That's karaoke.  He just closes his eyes.  Are you going to storyboard this, too?  Do you have a...  After you write it?  What the fuck are you guys coming up with?  Hey, he gets this at a karaoke guy.  Vignettes.  Do you have a...  I want to know what love is by Farner.  Yeah, that's what I'm going to play.  That's what I'm singing.  Then as she walks up to him, he thinks that's going to be the moment.  She just goes, hey, good job.  He walks away and he's crushed.  Oh, great. 
[03:16:30]  My girlfriend, who's a moderator in the room, says, O-Fan has just been bounced from relationship.  All right, ready?  Sue Johansson, as we wait for Shawnee to call in.  Sue Johansson.  To call in.  She's the grandma.  The old sex expert.  She's a grandma from Canada.  And she takes these graphic sex questions and answers them like a granny would. 
[03:17:00]  Well, listen to this one.  We're moving on.  We've got Brandy on the line.  Hi, Brandy.  Hi, Brandy.  Hi, Sue.  This is Brandy.  I like and enjoy it.  I enjoy it.  Oh, thank you.  Very educational.  Yeah.  The question I have is, is rough anal sex?  Hold on, what?  15 minutes she's calling in.  15 minutes?  10.30.  10.30.  10.30.  Oh.  Shut up.  The little pitter-patter of all of my heart. 
[03:17:30]  Would you stop it?  You've built this up into something that it isn't.  In an hour and a half, you've made this from me being a fan of her as an actress.  Uh-huh.  And building it up into some kind of big thing that now has a 15-minute countdown.  Jesus Christ.  And when he first talks to her, he's going to go, now, look, the guy's ribbing.  We're not talking. 
[03:18:00]  Oh, it is going to be so awkward.  Shut up, Bill.  It is just going to be so awkward.  Bill's just fucking, you are the worst, man.  You are the worst.  Anthony, I'm on your side.  I'm trying to make this love connection happen.  Stay tuned to watch Anthony fall on his face.  This is going to be awful.  No.  It's funny.  I mean, all the success he's had in his career, in his professional career and all that, the  second she calls up, he's going to go right back to be, what's it, Woodshop Anthony?  Woodshop Anthony with a big shellacked S that he made for her. 
[03:18:30]  He wants to hand it to her, but as he's walking down the hallway, she's talking to a jock and  he wants to, like, just hide it now because he's ashamed.  Yeah.  And then as he walks away, she finally sees him and says, well, what's that for?  And he's just like, oh, I just really like Saturday.  I'm a fan of Superman.  You don't want this, do you?  You don't want it, do you?  I don't know, I won't fit in my locker. 
[03:19:00]  I'm an idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  Woodshop Anthony sounds a lot like English Jimmy.  Oh, very much so.  English class Jimmy.  And Woodshop Anthony and English class Jimmy were a couple of shy, self-hating douches.  Here we go.  Today, Woodshop Anthony made an appearance unexpectedly.  I was math class Billy.  We've all been there.  Yeah.  Math class Billy, huh?  Yeah, math class Billy.  Woodshop Anthony showed up.  Just wanted to be loved.  Big shellacked S.  A big shellacked S.  With that, like, it opens up. 
[03:19:30]  If you open the S up, you can, it's got little shelves in it.  You can put your, you can put your jewelry in your neck.  I had to use the router to make it.  Look, a little secret compartment where you can put your little I love you's.  You know, he stayed after school working on it.  The wood teacher, Anthony, we're closing up.  He really seemed to be working hard on that.  Is it for anybody special?  And he gets all bashful.  Yeah.  Come on.  Well, maybe you'll tell me when you're ready.  You guys have this all worked out into a fucking five-act play. 
[03:20:00]  It smells like varnish.  Oh, no.  No?  We just saw it.  We're not making this up, Anthony.  Oh, really?  I mean.  You're not making this up.  This isn't just this fabricated thing you saw off of one interview.  Anthony, you can rip for ten minutes on bullshit, but we have been going for an hour and a half.  That's right.  The only thing you can do for an hour and a half is the truth.  Oh, is that it?  And we didn't even point out.  The truth is determined by how long you speak.  And we didn't even point out that you really love Shawnee Smith because of her initials. 
[03:20:30]  I almost explained that.  We're an idiot.  All right.  Listen.  Sue Johansson.  Let's get back into this.  Yes, let's.  See, I'm trying to help you out, eh?  Yeah.  Sure you are.  Actually, I'm just trying to keep the audience there so they can all hear it.  I don't want them getting bored.  There's no way they're going to leave.  They know the awkwardness that's coming.  Oh.  Yeah.  The question I have is, is rough anal sex safe and okay? 
[03:21:00]  Is rough anal sex safe?  Yeah.  Is it okay?  Okay.  How?  I worry about it.  Let's put it that way.  Because the rectum is a very, very fine mucous membrane.  It tears very easily.  Doesn't heal very quickly.  Not like your vagina.  The vagina is cast iron.  I mean, you figure the vagina can stretch wide enough to deliver a 10-pound baby. 
[03:21:30]  Yeah.  The vagina can take a real lot of rough and tumble play.  But the rectum isn't designed for that.  So, I worry about getting a tear in there.  Holy crap.  That's kind of obvious, huh?  Wow.  The ass isn't really made for rough sex.  Way to take the fun out of the show.  Jesus.  Basically, your asshole is like wet onion paper.  Yeah.  We're having fun.  Why isn't it?  Oh, my God. 
[03:22:00]  Wow.  She has no qualms.  Oh, my God.  About talking about her.  Grandma talking about anal sex.  Most gruesome of subject matter.  Of the rough kind.  Oh, my God.  Don't look at me like that, Jimmy.  All right.  Here's another clip.  Yes, another clip.  She worries about anal sex here.  Because then you've got feces.  You know feces?  Oh, my God.  Poop, poop.  Coming down.  Because then you've got feces.  And feces are loaded with bacteria.  Yeah.  And bacteria get into that little tear. 
[03:22:30]  You've got an anal abscess.  Oh, my God.  You do.  So, I worry about it.  I really do.  Yeah.  Are you practicing safer sex using a condom?  Arthur.  Uh-huh.  You are?  Awful.  What?  Oh, my God.  That's Arthur.  Awful.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Arthur.  I was thinking of the other drunken King of Comedy.  That's horrible.  I remember.  John Gielgud died and he went to the bar.  Yeah, you're right.  The guy next to him.  I was thinking of King of Comedy, that other scene where he's seen him on TV. 
[03:23:00]  Same guy.  Why don't we do movie scenes and stuff?  We can talk about.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Okay, let's do movie scenes.  All right, we can do movie scenes.  We can do movie scenes that we can picture Anthony being in.  Let's start with Jerry Maguire.  Sleepless in Seattle.  What's that one?  You make me want to be a better man.  As good as it gets.  As good as it gets.  What part do you want to play?  I was going to name all the movies I would never go see.  You got mail. 
[03:23:30]  Ice castles.  Ice castles.  Ice castles.  That's actually a reference from a comedian.  I don't even know what that is.  Yeah, of course you don't.  Are you practicing safer sex using a condom?  Uh-huh.  You are?  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, that's one release that I'm not worried about now.  But I am worried about doing damage to the rectum.  All right.  Who likes rough handle sex? 
[03:24:00]  You or your partner?  A little bit of both.  But mostly me.  Mostly you?  Uh-huh.  Okay.  Would you be aware enough and honest enough to say to your partner,  Ouch!  Whoa!  That hurts.  Oh, yeah.  Yes, I do.  Okay.  Okay.  And is he using penis or is he using toys?  Oh, my God.  Penis.  Okay.  A tickle me elbow.  I worry about it. 
[03:24:30]  I worry about it.  It's up to you.  It's your rectum, not mine.  Thank God.  Wow.  Imagine what hers looks like.  Yeah.  Fucking...  Could take a destroyer.  It's probably a brownish-gray shriveled cereal.  Oh, God.  Color of Barack Obama's lips.  Probably looks like a wasp nest.  Oh, God.  Rough sex. 
[03:25:00]  Great.  Yeah.  Rough anal sex.  Awful.  Yeah.  What are you going to say to her?  I'm not even giving it any thought.  There's no thought going into this.  Yeah.  You guys are so revved up and excited.  She's going to call up.  I'm just continuing.  Oh, Jimmy's going to do it now.  Jimmy's going to do it.  Hear it.  Hear it.  Jimmy Norton as Anthony Cumia on the phone with Shawnee Smith. 
[03:25:30]  Shawnee, hi.  This is Anthony Cumia on the show.  And the guys are giving me a big rabbit.  It's going to be like that kind of like really casual.  Like, you know, you silly goose.  I don't know how it is.  You know, and deep down, he's going, please, Shawnee, I love you.  I love you, Shawnee.  Jesus Christ.  I wish this was a private phone call.  So it's got to be one extreme or the other, right?  I know you want to.  There's no middle ground with me.  It's got to be either, ah, dude, you know, it's nothing.  Or, I love you.  No, you're going to try to overcompensate and try to act just like.  All right. 
[03:26:00]  Wait, wait.  Dr. Burr is talking, people.  Hold on.  I want to give you full credit here.  Yelling over me.  People, take notes.  Take notes now because Dr. Bill Burr is talking.  Go ahead, doctors.  Because I'm going towards the truth.  Dr. Burr.  He's very hostile right now.  And here he is, Dr. Burr.  He's very hostile.  Dr. Burr.  He's interrupting.  And, ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Burr.  He doesn't want to hear what I have to say.  This is a very childish reaction.  Because he's gone back to his childhood with this feeling of this love that he has not felt since his sophomore year. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah, yeah.  How do your colleagues feel about this?  We agree.  Your colleagues.  Oh, Dr. Norton?  We're all in it.  And what about Dr. Hughes?  We haven't consulted with Dr. Hughes.  Opie, do you concur?  Oh, my God.  This is the greatest day of my life.  Yeah.  He is literally coming unglued right now.  I am not unglued.  Now, did I make you uncomfortable?  Hey, they're all giving me all this gum because you made me laugh. 
[03:27:00]  Yeah, Jimmy's got me down.  That's it.  That's me.  To a T.  To a T.  You know, no fate 301 from Whackbag.  Go fuck yourself.  Then don't fucking listen.  Oh, good.  I'm good.  I'm glad.  I'm glad you guys really prepped for the XM show today.  Two hours of this shit.  Then don't listen, you fuck.  Yeah.  No one listened, as a matter of fact.  I want everyone to tune out today. 
[03:27:30]  That's right.  Yes.  Phil's just that now he's like he really is a doctor.  He's observing me with these eyes like, all right.  I'm just looking in.  I'm on the outside looking in.  This is called playing it out.  We just need a phone call and we can move on.  This is observation.  That's all.  That's all.  Tee-dee-dum-dum-dum-dum.  About seven minutes away.  What are you going to say to her?  No, my car isn't wrecked.  McNasty from FBA.  When I get home, it's not going to be wrecked with a sledgehammer. 
[03:28:00]  I got shit so bad, but I got to wait for Anthony to bomb again.  I'm dying.  Bomb again?  When did I bomb today, sir?  I don't think he means with humor.  I'd like to know when I bombed.  I think he means kind of emotionally.  I mean everything.  When did I?  You're completely unraveled right now.  You are.  We lost the adult Anthony.  We lost Opie and Anthony.  It's Opie.  Opie and what?  Shut up.  At least spit it out.  All right.  Hummer, hummer, hummer. 
[03:28:30]  It's Opie and his shy friend.  The Opie and shy friend show.  You can't.  There is too much pleasure being derived from this.  Thank you to the people that get it.  Everyone's saying this is some of the greatest stuff ever.  Anthony.  We know when we suck on the radio.  Anthony.  Oh, tender sentiment.  A tender sentiment.  Do you need a tender sentiment?  Do I need one?  I think you do.  You guys are picking on me. 
[03:29:00]  Just to prep you for the phone call.  Ooh.  Ooh.  One almost jumped out.  That's like a kid.  Get back in there.  I should grab that one.  Bill, give Anthony a tender sentiment.  Anthony's a tender sentiment.  Let me, uh...  Shake it a little.  There you go.  Dig deep.  Get a good one.  Get a good tender sentiment.  Getting this one.  What are you going to say to him?  Right there.  Here is a tender sentiment.  Your attitude makes others happy. 
[03:29:30]  That's nice.  It sure is.  That's a nice one.  Thank you, Jimmy, for sharing your tender sentiments with me.  I don't think I wrote that one, but...  Where's Roland?  Let's get Roland in here.  We could goof on him for five minutes.  Roland, where are we at?  Still waiting, so she should be calling in any minute.  What is she doing interviews with?  The MTV Radio Forum.  The TXN.  Oh.  What is, um...  And just coming up, we have Jim Belushi coming in Wednesday, right? 
[03:30:00]  And Danny Bunnett.  Ducci.  Yep.  Danny Bunnett, Ducci.  His show started last night at VH1.  And Tina Fey is calling in during the XM hour.  What do we get tomorrow?  On Wednesday.  And we get Sharon Osbourne in studio on Thursday.  Anyone a big Tina Fey fan?  Well...  So we can all just pile on them?  Anyone appreciate her work?  Anyone?  So we can all build it up to something and just bash the hell out of them for fucking two hours?  Completely. 
[03:30:30]  Anyone?  What's wrong?  We haven't even looked at...  We're looking at Roland.  We're not bashing you.  Just asking.  We'll do the heavy lifting here.  You just get ready for your phone call.  Heavy lifting.  You just be shy.  It's okay.  You just write some thought stars down.  You just be shy.  You don't have to talk right now.  I'm not writing down anything.  No one asks you anything.  This is going to be quick and easy, my friend.  All right.  Calm down.  Anthony, just settle down.  Take a deep breath.  I'm going to order for her.  We'll have a malted with two straws and some ice cream for the lady. 
[03:31:00]  She will have the linguine and white clam sauce.  See?  There you go.  Hey, Shawny.  Isn't this great?  See?  There you go.  That's Anthony we know.  Well, who's tomorrow?  Saw 3.  What's it about, Roland?  Because we weren't able to ask them.  A horror movie.  I haven't seen it.  What was the first one of that?  I didn't see any of them.  You haven't seen any of the Saw movies?  No.  Why not?  You don't like scary movies?  No, I do.  I just...  What's your favorite scary movie?  Probably...  Kata. 
[03:31:30]  The Nightmare on Elm Street.  Which one?  One.  What do you like about that movie?  Just, I don't know, Freddy Krueger and...  Action.  Let me see if he's calling it.  Freddy Krueger and action.  Wait, what else?  I mean, there's a million horror movies that have, like, action and stuff.  Siskel and Retard.  What did you like about the movie?  What stands out in your mind? 
[03:32:00]  Just...  The action sequences.  Him going...  Terrorizing people.  Like, which one?  I don't know.  The person who sleeps and goes to their dreams.  You're the greatest thing ever.  Which Nightmare on Elm Street scene?  You're the greatest thing ever.  I remember Nightmare on Elm Street scenes.  I can name a bunch of them.  I love when his arms extended.  He scratches the walls with those long arms.  Absolutely, yeah.  It was terrifying.  Now, tell me what part you liked. 
[03:32:30]  The one where he jumps up from the water.  And...  Terrorizes that girl in the...  When you say terrorizes, what do you mean?  Well, he has a little claws.  He goes...  He goes...  He terrorizes.  He goes...  Little claws.  Yeah.  Possibly.  Yeah.  Possibly.  Yeah.  Who played him?  Robert England.  There you go.  What?  Who?  England? 
[03:33:00]  No, you had it the first time.  Robert England?  By the way, is Club Show to Kenny gone?  Yeah.  God damn it.  Remind me tomorrow.  We have to ask him about driving.  Just remind me to ask him.  Why?  Just...  You have to hear it.  You have to hear it.  What?  This happened in San Francisco?  She doesn't...  Yeah.  What did he do?  It's just the way he pronounced something.  Oh, my God.  He might be listening.  He could call in. 
[03:33:30]  So, uh...  All right, Roland.  Yeah.  All right.  Did you see any movies over the weekend?  Um, I saw Flags of Our Father.  What?  Oh, yeah?  Flags of Our Father.  Getting, like, four stars.  It was really good.  What'd you like about it?  Um, again, the action.  Action?  Action sequences?  It had a good story to it about...  What was it about?  The guy had a flag and went...  About Iwo Jima.  And?  It was...  The war scenes were pretty graphic. 
[03:34:00]  People aren't blowing off.  Their heads chopped off, you see.  And...  Chinese people are going,  No!  Chinese people?  Please.  Chinese people are going,  No!  All right.  Chinese people?  Hotline's ringing.  It's either going to be Shawnee or Club Soda Kenny.  Or Mark Cuban.  Or Mark Cuban.  Or Mark Cuban.  Oh, is this the same line that Shawnee's supposed to call on?  Nah.  Nah.  No.  What is it?  Oh, all right.  Is this Shawnee? 
[03:34:30]  Club Soda.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Hi.  What did you say that you wanted to drive and look at?  Uh, he went to go see the fall foliage.  Oh, God.  The fall foliage.  The fall foliage.  Yeah.  Fall foliage.  Foliage.  Yeah, it's a nice thing to do.  You see the leaves? 
[03:35:00]  Fall foliage.  Yeah.  What do you mean foliage?  Yeah, same difference.  Same difference.  All right.  We've got to keep this line free for...  Bye, Kenny.  All right.  All right.  Foliage.  All right.  Are you looking forward to Shawnee calling back Club Soda?  Yeah, I'm very proud of Anthony.  He's got nothing to be embarrassed about.  Yeah, thanks, Kenny.  Yeah, you hang in there.  Thank you, Kenny.  All right.  You know, she looks like good eats. 
[03:35:30]  All right.  Thanks, Kenny.  I had to hang up on Kenny because we've got to keep the line clear.  Oh, and Roland walked out on us?  Ah, he knows.  He slinked out.  I wish I could do that.  Oh, you don't want to.  You'll miss her call.  Yeah, you're actually looking forward to this.  This reminds him of that one Friday night.  Oh, here it is.  Where he got the pretty girl's number.  Oh, no.  She gave her...  She's like, well, give me yours because my iPhone's broken.  And he gave her the number and he was hoping she'd call.  It was like Friday and by 1030 he realized she wasn't going to call.  No, there was one time this girl was named Crystal. 
[03:36:00]  Her name was Crystal.  And she was at school and she said she was going to meet me at a place and never showed up.  Oh, where was the place?  A waterfall?  I don't know.  It was some bar.  But it was, you know, I think it was like high school, 18.  Why didn't she come?  Ah, she didn't like me.  When did you see her again?  Um, never.  In school. 
[03:36:30]  But you bumped into her again?  Yeah.  What'd you say?  Nothing.  You just pretended it didn't happen?  I just avoided her.  Yeah, yeah.  You're embarrassed.  Yeah, I pretended it didn't happen.  What'd you say?  Hey, what are you doing tonight?  And she was like, uh, nothing?  Yeah.  No, she seemed like into it when I asked.  Fucking bitch.  All right.  And she didn't come?  Hold on.  We got Mark Cuban calling in to say hi.  Mark, what's up?  What's up, boys?  How y'all doing?  Pretty good.  What are you doing, man?  I'm actually on my way to work.  Just got, you know, in the car, cruising down North Central Expressway in Dallas. 
[03:37:00]  You don't work.  You don't work?  Yeah, what work?  Well, I just go to the office.  I don't work.  You know, I got to stand there and look good.  You just have to look good at work?  Well, you know, for me, I mean, just make it look like I'm working so, you know, other  people think they have to work.  Because if I just sit there and do nothing, then, you know, people, you know, try to copy what  I might do, you know?  Right, right, right.  Oh.  Okay, let's try that again.  Right, right, right, right.  How's that?  Why, why? 
[03:37:30]  It was active listening you just did there, Opie.  Did I detect a love connection here?  Oh, baby.  You know it.  We're just a little bit distracted, Mark, because Anthony is smitten.  Anthony is smitten with a girl, and she's calling in shortly, and he's, like, nervously  fidgeting with his Canada dry.  He's holding it with both hands.  I know.  I know.  What did his name used to be?  I always do.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Anthony's got a crush on the actress from Saw 3.  I don't need another gazillionaire making fun of me, Opie. 
[03:38:00]  Her name is Shawnee Smith.  Shawnee Smith, and Anthony was smitten with her today.  She brought Anthony back 25 years, and he didn't know that was going to happen, but sitting  there, he was the shy boy.  Oh, man.  He was a lad.  He wasn't even a man.  He was a lad.  Oh, my God.  Just a puff.  Well, hey, it's got to happen.  That's a good thing, right?  Yeah.  It's going to happen.  It's a great way to kind of slide into the holidays, the whole after-school special vibe  that was going on here. 
[03:38:30]  It's a complete fabrication in these guys' minds.  Hey, you know, you've got to get it done, Anthony.  You've got to put them in their place.  Anthony's embarrassed that we saw it, and that it was that obvious.  He didn't think it was that obvious.  He probably didn't even realize it, but...  It's a three-on-one over here.  That's what I'm playing against right now, three-on-one.  He's looking at us like we're not trying to help him.  We're on his side, but he's so embarrassed by these feelings of love.  Yeah, and we have Dr. Bill Burr here helping, thank God. 
[03:39:00]  How you doing, Mark?  A PhD in dick jokes is here.  Let him have it.  Let him have it.  Hey, what is...  Do you have two films coming out?  We've got a bunch from Carl.  We've got one called The Architect on December 1st with Isabella Rossellini, and talk about  hot and young.  Hayden Christensen, the blonde, that cheerleader on Heroes, and Anthony LaPaglia.  It's a movie about this architect who builds this big building that he thinks is just beautiful 
[03:39:30]  and a Taj Mahal, and then 20 years later, it turns into a slum, and it's about all these  people that are living it revolting.  It's just kind of like a family drama, kind of a screwed-up family type thing.  But it turned out really good, and it's an interesting movie.  It has a lot of social qualities to it.  Is there any love interest or anything like that in the movie?  I'm just telling you, Hayden Christensen, who's...  I can't really talk about her this way, because she's only 17 years old, is trying to decide 
[03:40:00]  whether to hook up with her, Anthony.  It's a sight to be seen.  But yeah, it's really good.  They have another one with Parker Posey, and Jeff Goldblum is kind of a spy thriller by  Hal Hartley called Dave Grimm that's coming out first of the year.  Why doesn't Parker Posey get more parts than pictures?  Hey, can we have that?  We want to interview them.  Oh, sure, sure.  I'll get you copies of the movie and get your interviews set up.  That's no problem at all.  We love those, especially Goldblum.  I love him. 
[03:40:30]  Yeah, and Jeff, hey, I'll tell you what, Jeff's a trip boy.  He can get out there and have some fun, that's for sure.  How great was she in House of Yes?  I missed that one.  Oh, it's a really good one.  Sounds smitten there, Jimmy.  Yes, I am.  Just complimenting.  I love Parker Posey.  See that admitting to his voice?  She's a great actress.  That's what I have to do, Anthony.  If you did that two hours ago, you wouldn't be in this position right now.  And Goldblum's a brilliant actor.  Hey, Mark, not a fan of YouTube, huh?  You know, I like YouTube.  I actually like it a lot.  I use it. 
[03:41:00]  I just think, you know, it's like selling crack.  You can make money selling crack until you get busted.  And, you know, they were just stealing stuff.  You know, if they just took all the O&A audio and just popped it up on YouTube and sold  ads around it, that wouldn't be right.  And that's basically what they're doing.  Well, we kind of encourage our fans to throw all that stuff up there.  So, you know, it's one thing to throw it up there to promote, and it's a whole other  thing to build a business on it.  You know, and that's the thing. 
[03:41:30]  You know, it's just these guys are taking, you know, TV shows, movies.  We found some of our movie stuff up there, and just popping it up there, and like, hey,  you know what?  We don't care.  If you don't like it, sue us.  And, you know, it's not the big deal to me, but when you look at it, it's like somebody's  going to sue them, and it's already started.  And most people, don't you think most people look at it as promotion for their project,  though?  Well, it just depends on what they're putting up there.  I mean, I don't, you know, when they put up a whole episode of Family Guy, or a whole 
[03:42:00]  episode of South Park, that's not promotion.  Right.  That takes money from the sale of a DVD.  Hey, Mark.  Right.  You just said the kid that played Darth Vader is beautiful.  Hayden Christensen's the kid that played Darth Vader.  What's his name?  Ah, shit.  You know, you gotta like what you gotta like, right?  Um, ah, I forget her name.  I always want to call her Hayden Christensen.  Who's the part of the hero?  Natalie Portman? 
[03:42:30]  No.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Shawnee?  No, not Shawnee.  No, you know the show's on Monday Night Heroes?  She plays a two-meter chick in it.  Anyways.  Yeah.  This doesn't look like the kid from Star Wars.  Take my word for it.  Hey, what's going to be the next big thing with the internet?  Where's this all going?  You know, it's hard to say.  You know, I think it's kind of settled down some.  I think, you know, video's cool and a lot of people got it going on. 
[03:43:00]  And, you know, the cool thing about YouTube is you can find anything that you want there.  But, you know, sort of sorting out what's legal and illegal is going to get people in trouble.  But, you know, video's cool.  I think most of the good stuff, though, is going to happen with cell phones.  So you'll see your cell phone will be able to do more and more and more from acting like a credit card to playing your music, which a lot of them can do now, to playing videos, to getting TV.  It's not like you're going to sit in front of your cell phone and just watch TV. 
[03:43:30]  But, you know, it's kind of like it's a cure for boredom.  You know, when we were growing up, you know, you'd go out and you'd read a book or buy a magazine or, you know, listen to whatever, listen to records.  And now you just, you know, turn on your cell phone and, you know, you can play games, you can do whatever.  And I think that's going to be more of kind of a time killer that people get more involved with.  So that's kind of what I'm looking at.  And you can buy stuff through the vending machines there with your cell phone, right?  Is that finally coming to America?  Yeah, it's starting to happen now.  They've got it in Japan and Korea and stuff, and that's starting to happen. 
[03:44:00]  And, you know, we're doing tests like in some of the landmark theaters where you just text a number to a landmark, to a code we set up at the theater,  and it just charges your cell phone bill for the ticket.  And then you just walk into the theater.  So, you know, that kind of stuff.  And texting is obviously getting bigger and bigger and bigger.  And, you know, texting to phone codes and stuff to be able to get downloads and whatever, that's getting bigger.  So it's cool.  A lot of stuff is happening.  When do you retire? 
[03:44:30]  I am retired.  I mean, no, but you're still looking for opportunities here and there.  I mean, when do you just say, you know what, fuck it, I don't feel like being creative anymore.  No, because that's boring, you know.  I just like, I just, you know, to me, business is like a sport, you know, and you play as long as you can.  And that's what I like about it.  It's just the juice of competing all the time and getting after people.  You know, if I want to fuck with YouTube or Google and just, you know, say what's on my mind, that's fun to me.  You know, that's like getting out there and punking somebody. 
[03:45:00]  And even if you put yourself out there and get punked, right, you know, it's just the competitive aspect of it.  That's what I like.  And so I'll keep on doing it until I can't do it anymore.  Right on, right on, right on indeed.  You know, and then, you know, like Anthony's just hanging out there chasing the young things, and I'm looking for Hayden Christensen now, too.  Yeah, that beautiful girl, Hayden Christensen.  Hey, the way he played fucking Darth Vader.  Hey, he's tough.  Just about a chick. 
[03:45:30]  Whiny bastard.  Oh, man, you guys kill me.  Are you part of...  What's that?  I was going to say, you're part of Gold Rush?  My what one?  Gold Rush, that game show they're doing on AOL and all that?  Not part of that at all.  Okay, so...  Not part of that at all.  Wrong info.  My TV gig is HDNet, so...  Oh, let me tell you about that.  Okay, check out what we got going on with HDNet.  You guys will get a trip on this.  We got two shows.  One is we got Dennis Rodman coming back, and we haven't announced all the details yet, 
[03:46:00]  but we're putting Dennis Rodman in a show called Geek the Freak.  And what he's going to do is he's going to go out and find, you know, secretaries and  turn them into strippers, and, you know, we've got this one episode where he turns  this, you know, mild-mannered biologist guy who just, like, just, you know, dissects  frogs all day into a transvestite.  It's a trip.  It's a trip.  So that's one show we got coming on HDNet, and then check this one out.  This one's not definite yet, but we're working on it.  Remember the Coors Light Twins? 
[03:46:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you know, I like, da-da-da, and twins, and you get these two hot chicks with the  fake titties and everything.  Well, one of them, I mean, they're hot.  I've seen them in person.  They're smoking hot, and they're really cool, too.  So one of them sends an email saying, you know what, Mark?  I just got married, and I want to give my husband a present before we have our first  kid.  I'm like, okay, what's the present?  Anal sex.  She's like, what?  Manage a trois.  She wants to have a threesome.  And that's not the best part.  But the best part is, she wants to turn it into a reality show. 
[03:47:00]  Yeah, that's pretty cool.  Yeah, so that's what we're going to do.  So we got her out there telling her husband, shopping for the chick to include, and then  doing the deal.  I have a great idea for your HDNet.  All right.  You should buy Lucky Louie from HBO, and then put it on there.  That was a great show, wasn't it?  That was a great show.  Oh, thank you.  I liked that show.  They canceled it.  I know.  I just read about it, but I liked it.  You know Jim Norton was in it, right? 
[03:47:30]  I knew he was in it, but I didn't put you all together until just now.  You should buy it and put it on a channel, because we had a lot of viewers.  HBO doesn't really let you take the shows that they're done with.  They get really protective about that stuff.  I don't know.  They might be up for selling this one.  They might be.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'll call my guy over there.  We'll see.  It was a good show.  Thanks, man.  It was a really good show.  Yeah, that's pretty cool.  All right, Mark.  We'll let you go.  Thank you, Mark.  All right, guys.  I appreciate it.  Have a good one.  Thank you, Mark.  Mark Cuban, everyone.  Take care, man.  All right.  A little update from one of our pals. 
[03:48:00]  Looks like somebody doesn't really care about calling in.  Going to ruin the whole thing.  You know how high up his voice went?  Uh-huh.  Just like high school.  Looks like somebody's not going to call in.  You know what that was?  Champagne cocktail.  Champagne cocktail.  That was, um, well, here we go again.  Yeah, I know.  That really, that I'll give you.  Sit by the phone.  That I'll give you.  And it doesn't ring.  No, here we go again.  That interview's over.  Now, where else, where are the attack dogs going to go? 
[03:48:30]  No.  No.  No.  They're not like that.  No.  All right.  As we wait for Shawnee to call.  I'm going to tinkle.  No.  I have to tinkle.  No.  We got a blind.  What do you got there?  Huh?  What do you got there?  Blind phone sex worker says she was scammed.  Blind woman with MD tried phone sex to make ends meet.  Oh, God.  What?  Is that her picture?  Yeah.  Yeah, this is her picture.  She looks like, uh, what's her name? 
[03:49:00]  Eh.  Eh.  It was, uh...  Terry Schiavo.  She was on the phone, uh, giving people phone sex, or...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Log on, and there are plenty of women willing to talk for a price.  It was just a way to make money.  A Knob Noster resident used to be one of those women.  She admits looks can be deceiving.  My name was Kayla on the line.  In real life, she's Janice Hugie.  Hello.  She's blind and has muscular dystrophy.  It's all a fraud.  The pictures they see online is a model that was paid for her pictures and paid to do certain things. 
[03:49:30]  The person you talk to is not the real person.  Unable to work because of her disability, Hugie gave phone sex a shot.  She says she started working for Erotic Communications in August, and so far, they haven't paid up.  Listen to her.  Why would...  She probably did a bunch of one-minute calls.  They would just hang up on her stupid face.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, she doesn't sound that sexy.  I would take sometimes anywhere from 8 to 15 calls a day. 
[03:50:00]  Okay, I'm catching up here.  And so by your calculation, how much money do you think that Erotic Communications owes you?  I would say probably close to $8,000.  At rates well over a dollar a minute, Hugie says she went through a lot to earn her cash.  A lot of them want to talk about, you know, different sexual acts, but then some of them just want to talk.  And now she can't get Erotic Communications to talk, and neither could we.  Making great cash while working from home.  If so, leave me a message with your name, your telephone number, and a good description of your voice. 
[03:50:30]  We did leave a message, but it was not returned.  Janice Hugie has her own message for her former boss at Erotic Communications.  I hope that she doesn't get a chance to do this to anybody else.  Ew.  It's just, ew.  Well, you're blind with muscle.  Maybe she's taking checks and you misplaced them.  She wiped her ass one time.  She thought it was just rough toilet paper.  It's an $8,000 check with a log on it.  Fucking dopey blind muscular dystrophy. 
[03:51:00]  Watch your thigh with dignity.  Stop jerking guys off over the phone.  He's got something on the side.  I don't know.  Go like this.  Go like this.  I don't care.  He's just going to leave it there now.  I don't know why you.  Jimmy's got some kind of, what is that?  A piece of vegetable on your upper lip because you're eating a sandwich.  Don't even look at it.  And now it's just distracting.  It's like a zit beauty mark.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a white Cindy Crawford thing.  That's all right.  Why would anyone fucking pay her? 
[03:51:30]  Look at you.  You're fat and blind and you have MD.  Here's your payment.  She couldn't even talk right here.  Here's your payment.  I won't kick you in the stomach.  Hey, we ready for line of the day?  I got to piss.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  It's still there, Jim.  That's right.  Line of the day.  It's still there.  Fair.  Yeah.  Did you wipe that off?  Roland, what's going on?  There you think you are.  The glory hole.  Keep going.  I don't care.  I don't care.  And I go, it's right there.  And you're like, where? 
[03:52:00]  What?  She's wrapping up an interview and they're getting her to a landline to call in.  Any minute?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But Roland is...  But, um...  This is a fitting end.  Mm-hmm.  Just like all his romances in high school.  He was just let on.  That's right.  He just let on.  That the phone call was coming.  That's right.  Unfortunately, this is more a fitting end for you guys because, uh, much like you guys were  expecting so much out of this.  Once again, the lashing out.  Mm-hmm.  And got, um, so little out of it. 
[03:52:30]  It's very critical in these kinds of cases.  Of course it is.  Dr. Norton cases.  That's right.  Certainly.  Now it's a case.  Looks like he'll be fucking, uh, pulling seeds out of pot on a big, on a big piece of  wood shaped like an S.  Dude, they're photoshopping your ass off.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Okay.  They got hearts.  Bunch of hearts and captions.  They're doing a lot of the, with the caption contest.  Oh, they got the twinkle in your eye.  What a giggly goo.  Giggly goo.  Giggly goo?  I don't think I was giggly goo-ish.  You were giggly goo.  All right. 
[03:53:00]  Hey, line of the day.  We'll do this, uh, as we hopefully get a phone call from Shawnee Smith to wrap up this mess.  Sponsored by BodogFight.com.  Log on and watch American fighters battle for the right to represent the U.S.  and a bout against the Russians.  It's all on BodogFight.com, a mixed martial arts tournament and docu-reality unlike any  seen before.  Here is the, uh, runner-up line of the day.  Well, how are you supposed to say you're so tiny?  No, you said you're so tiny.  You're so much smaller than you.  Yeah, small broad. 
[03:53:30]  It was just how your voice changed.  Hey, dame.  You're so much tinier.  Well, you expected it to be 35 feet tall like she is in a movie theater.  Jermaine, runner-up line of the day.  That's a funny one.  35 feet tall.  You ass.  Thanks to BodogFight.com, here is today's line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day. 
[03:54:00]  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Oh, my God, am I getting a hammering.  I'm a Nazi.  Are you a Nazi?  Did I win line of the day?  You did.  Yeah.  Aw, shucks.  Good for you.  And with that, I think we got Shawnee Smith on the line.  No?  The camera is here. 
[03:54:30]  Look at Sam runs in, almost trips over his huge feet with his camera.  To get, uh, what?  Both hands.  What do you think you're going to get?  Both hands on the Canada Dry model.  Stop with the both hands.  Just hold it.  He doesn't know what to do with his hands.  Look at him.  He is so nervous.  I'm like Jimmy acting.  No, you're going to hear this, like, just the crinkle, like.  The crinkle of the nervous hands on the bottle.  He's shy.  I have never seen him, eh?  Anthony's out of sorts.  Anthony, don't disappoint us, because I know you. 
[03:55:00]  Play it out, motherfucker.  I'm not playing out anything.  We would just waste two and a half hours.  Play it out, motherfucker.  Assessment.  Two and a half hours we waited for this phone call.  What are we waiting for?  What do you have to do to wait to take it?  Just waiting for you to sweat a little more.  What do you wait for, uh...  What's going through your mind right now, Anthony?  Nothing.  I do a radio show every day.  This is part of it. 
[03:55:30]  Dr. Norton, your assessment doctor.  Not that I'm going with my hands.  I can make other letters.  I think this is it, guys.  Go ahead.  Shawnee.  Anthony.  Hi, Shawnee.  How are you?  Hi, Anthony.  I know this is, like, totally unprofessional.  Yeah.  But, um, I don't know.  I mean, I felt a little something.  Was I picking up on that?  Did you? 
[03:56:00]  You know, like, I don't know.  Maybe we could...  I want you, Anthony.  Look at what they've done to you.  Look at what they've done to you.  I have been getting hammered over here for, uh, two hours.  Two and a half hours.  Two hours because I'm a big fan of yours.  And, and, stalker.  And every word, they, they pulled apart every single word that I said and said that I said  things in too high a voice and that I was giddy and everything. 
[03:56:30]  And I, and all I said was, I said, I, I'm a big fan of yours and that I think you're  very pretty.  Hold on.  And, and then I got...  Well, I just want everyone to know that I was feeling it too.  So, if your voice raised, my voice raised.  Shawnee, what did he say to you after the interview?  Because it didn't make the air.  There's something about you being tiny.  Do you remember that?  Um, yeah.  I, she wasn't listening. 
[03:57:00]  She wasn't listening.  See that?  You said that, he said to you, uh, how you look so much tinier in person.  But she hears that from everybody.  Yeah, well, he's trying to get a date, you know?  She, she, she, she, she heard desperation.  Did you hear that?  She says that everybody says that, though.  So, it's one of those things that you just throw out there.  Well, my body might be tiny, but I have a big heart.  Shawnee, see.  Well, Anthony has a big...  He, he, he, he, just the way he just said this too.  He goes, and, and, I'm a big fan and you're very pretty. 
[03:57:30]  Oh, my God.  See, Jimmy's tearing it apart again.  You said pretty weird.  I can't even talk.  We think it's cute.  We, we, we've never seen, this is shy, Anthony.  We've never seen this.  Yeah, he was very smitten with you, Shawnee.  It's been a three-on-one gang up on me about this whole thing.  And he, he couldn't even compliment you.  He's afraid to compliment you because he doesn't want his true, like, his heart to be that open.  I'm not, I'm not afraid to compliment you.  No, no, no, but, like...  I, I love her work, and I think she's a very pretty girl.  Why, why is that bad?  See, he's very on the surface. 
[03:58:00]  You see that?  It's a real man who can express that kind of view.  She's a very pretty girl.  Thank you, Shawnee.  Girl.  Anthony, I love you.  I love you, Shawnee.  I love you, too.  Tell me.  We're just professing our love to each other.  Could you ask her out?  I want to hear, like, even though you can't because, you know, you have a girlfriend.  What, what, am I acting now?  Yes.  I would like to hear you ask her out.  Jimmy Norton.  What am I acting now?  No, wait, get Steve, get Steve to act out the line.  Yeah, get Steve to do it.  What's the line?  Shawnee, how would you ask me out?  Let's see.  How would you do it? 
[03:58:30]  Let's write the line and then hear Steve deliver it.  Shawnee, you want to go out?  Huh?  Shawnee, you want to go out?  Why not?  Shawnee, you want to go out?  Why not?  Why not?  How would you ask her out?  How would you ask her out?  How would you have this relationship die?  Don't hide behind your impersonations.  Yeah.  I'm not hiding behind anything.  We want to hear the real Anthony.  I think I have.  Express your love for the woman.  I think I have dealt with this situation.  It wasn't what Billy Burr wanted.  What's the matter, Billy?  I didn't get all flustered and throw up.  Very hostile. 
[03:59:00]  Very angry.  I was honest in telling Shawnee how I feel about her work and her meeting her.  It was a very nice thing.  It was fun.  Let's go beneath the surface.  Let's tap into the feelings.  Beneath the...  Doctor, where did you go to school, Dr. Bill Burr?  He said to her, you said you're a very...  Stand-up comedian?  You're a very good actress.  I like your stuff.  You're kicking me out of the car, but Anthony, I'll wait for you.  Oh, thank you, Shawnee.  All right, when you're done with that girlfriend.  If you're done with that girlfriend, I'll be waiting.  Thank you, Shawnee.  You're my two children. 
[03:59:30]  You get children out of the house.  I get a prefab family.  I get a romantic mood.  I get a prefab family.  You get the...  Yeah.  We're going to play your song, too.  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah, we're going to play your song.  Shawnee, we had a lot of fun with you today, and then we talked about you for two and a  half hours after you left.  Good luck with song three.  Because Anthony was...  Thank you, guys.  We just noticed he was very smitten.  We'd never seen him blush before.  Yeah, he's like...  Isn't that sweet?  His body language got all uncomfortable looking.  There are some people that come into the studio that are celebrities, and one of them was 
[04:00:00]  with Jimmy Norton here was Ozzy Osbourne.  He came in and gushed over Ozzy Osbourne.  I did.  If I came off...  But he admitted to it.  But he came off like...  But it wasn't an in love thing like that.  It was.  I was...  I'm saying that she's...  You look so much tighter.  See, I was doing very well.  Now I'm falling apart again is how it happened.  No, Shawnee, I just wanted to say, you're a really good actress.  I like your work.  You're very pretty.  Did you hear him just curl into himself? 
[04:00:30]  You're very pretty.  He did.  He brought his knees up into his chest.  There's no way out of it.  Why don't we let Shawnee and Anthony talk for a minute here?  Oh, no.  What?  Oh, great.  Just let us...  Well, you know, the girlfriend, we don't want to get you in trouble.  We've already spoken.  Actually, my girlfriend, a big fan of yours, too.  I'm on my way to the top ten.  That's how she comes up in conversation a lot.  Big ten.  Yeah.  We got disconnected.  Click.  She got...  She wasn't able to hear our side. 
[04:01:00]  Yeah, yeah.  And then got disconnected.  She just made an excuse because she...  She went big ten.  We got disconnected.  Then she held the phone up and went, and...  And click.  You just got hung up on.  Good.  She had enough of your fumblings.  I've had it.  Your sticky fumblings.  Is that where the anger comes from?  There's no anger.  I think it was handled very well.  It was, actually.  I think...  You guys...  I'm not fine.  No, no, no.  Clear, like, when you just kind of keep your eyebrows up as you're talking.  No, I thought it was handled very well.  And I drink my club soda now without getting critiqued on how I'm holding the fucking bottle. 
[04:01:30]  You were holding it with both bottles.  When you heard Shawnee, internally, you went...  I did not.  A little bottle crinkler.  When he finally gets out to his car and he's by himself and it's safe, he's just...  He's just a throw-up.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I am not.  You're a good actress.  I like your stuff.  You're very pretty.  She thought the phone hung up on her.  Maybe she'll call back.  Well, someone better get in touch with her and let her know we didn't hang up.  If she...  Because I don't want anyone to... 
[04:02:00]  I don't want her to think anyone here treated her rudely.  Did you get enough?  They're photoshopping you in the Say Anything poster.  Oh, very good.  There you go.  You and the boombox.  Yeah, I'm there with you.  Oh, my God.  One joke fucking idiot.  Black bag is going crazy.  The photoshop section is going nuts right now.  Hate you all.  There you go.  You guys really fucking blow.  You really do.  Fucking over two hours of abuse on this one subject. 
[04:02:30]  Thank God the brilliant Dr. Burr was here to put the whole thing in perspective and context.  Listen, for me to take all the credit and to cut out Dr. Norton...  Dr. Norton and the esteemed Dr. Hughes.  Thank you, thank you.  All these psychiatrists here.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, that went well.  That was good.  It had an ending, at least.  We have to play her song, Hydro Vibe, featuring Shawnee Smith.  That's the name of the band, Hydro Vibe. 
[04:03:00]  The song's called Killer Inside, featuring Shawnee Smith.  Yes, it's off the Saw movie picture soundtrack.  Go see Saw.  See Saw.  Go see Saw.  Like a joke.  See you guys tomorrow.  This is Hydro Vibe, featuring Shawnee Smith, Killer Inside.  Thanks, Bill Burr.  Bye.  Bye. 
[04:03:30]  That whole nice guy.  No, no, it's just, no.  Like, I'm not even understanding myself, and you have to explain it to me?  I love that.  She's a fucking genius.  She is hot, though, man. 
[04:04:00]  Dr. Burr.  She is smoky.  Oh, she's gorgeous.  And she's a hot chick.  She's perfect for you.  Oh, there you go.  I can see why.  I love it.  Opie, are you coming up?  Let me, if you're going to come up.  Yeah, I'd like to.  Thomas, come home, right?  Yeah, just let me know.  Yeah, I'd like to go.  All right.  You want to go see my act for the ninth time?  Yeah, why not?  Good job, man.  Yeah.  I'm out of here. 
[04:04:30]  Thanks, Bill.  Thank you.  Billy, good job.  You feel my soul clammy?  Huh?  Who?  Daryl Hampton.  Yeah, that would be all right.  We'll get Daryl in.  That's the longest anyone's been in the barrel.  I said bucket on the way over here today, but the longest anyone's ever been in the barrel.  What's up, Steve?  Take a look at that.  Take a look at what?  What are we doing?  It's still on. 
[04:05:00]  Meetings, meetings.  Things are being said.  Should you chop some of my promo, the stuff that has the bucket?  Yeah.  Of course.  Of course.  Hey, can someone print out my mic?  ONA has keynote speakers?  No.  I thought.  No.  That's what I thought.  No.  What do you want?  Do your gig?  Huh?  What was his keynote speakers for? 
[04:05:30]  Ah, Syracuse University.  Tell Syracuse University to go fuck themselves.  All right.  Oh, we got to play our song still.  Didn't you start playing it?  Yeah.  Then we faded down to listen to Anthony some more.  We're still on the air.  I saw it said on a...  You didn't know we're on the air.  It said on Paltork, they're still on the air.  You didn't know.  You didn't know at first. 
[04:06:00]  I'm typing to the Paltork people.  All right.  This is Hydro Vibe featuring Shoney Smith.  We told her we'd play her song.  This is...  I actually did not know we were on the air.  I didn't say anything.  I know.  I know.  Fucking Steve comes in with information like a meeting and stuff.  See?  I don't say anything.  What am I going to say?  What the fuck am I going to say?  You didn't know.  I knew because someone blew it on Paltork.  They said they're still on the air.  Fucking Paltork.  They said they're still on the air.  You got rad.  Fucking Paltork.  You didn't know at first, though.  I didn't know at first.  You're right.  The acting was good. 
[04:06:30]  Now I know.  The acting was good that time.  I knew because Jimmy's hands weren't moving right.  I didn't know.  I had no idea.  I honestly didn't.  Believe me, if I would have known, it would have been like,  so is the show over, guys?  All right.  Now, look.  Look.  I turn the...  See?  I turn all the mics.  You just went around the track with them.  No, they're off.  Look.  All right.  All right.  Thank God they're off.  Yeah.  Oh.  Hmm.  That Bill Burwood.  I like to fuck him. 
[04:07:00]  Oh, is he hot.  All right.  Oh, no.  Stan's writing.  That's going to get...  Oh, boy.  That's probably going to be the end of every Bill Burr promo now.  Certainly will be.  It's going to be the intro to the show.  And Anthony.  Boy, that Bill Burr, I'd love to...  Oh, wait.  I ain't going to say it.  We're off the air.  Oh, yeah.  We're off the air.  Say it as a goof.  Yeah, I'm right.  Jesus Christ.  All right.  Hydrovibe featuring Shoney Smith from the Saw.  Soundtrack. 
[04:07:30]  This is Killer Inside.  Take a listen.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Thanks.  Yeah, buddy.  It's a messed up world.  Please deliver me from this mess that I've become. 
[04:08:00]  It's a messed up world.  You can teach me.  You can save me.  Yeah.  Sending chills across my skin.  When I hear you whisper.  Back a name.  Speak within.  Speak to me.  Wake up the killer inside.  Wake up the killer inside.  Wake up the killer inside. 
[04:08:30]  Wake up the killer inside.  Wake up the killer inside.  It's a messed up world.  Please enlighten me.  There's so much left to learn.  Messed up world.  You can show me.  You can save me.  You can save me.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[04:09:00]  I'm sending chills across my skin.  When I hear you whisper.  Back a name.  Speak within.  Speak to me.  Wake up the killer inside.  Wake up the killer inside.  Wake up the killer inside.  Wake up the killer inside.  Wake up the killer inside. 
[04:09:30]  Wake up the killer inside.  Wake up the killer inside of you.  We'll be right back. 
[04:10:00]  We'll be right back. 
[04:10:30]  And raw at times, pushing the limits as far as they can. 
[04:11:00]  Show your hairy pork chop.  My mother smokes crack rocks.  I'm for drunk teens.  What are you kidding?  How about I lay you down and give you a little bukkake?  We laugh.  We're going to have a disgusting body fluid blowout.  Gay porn.  Bow.  Hey, could you soap up your bad place?  The sluttier the better.  I would definitely be willing to have sex with you if we both already had AIDS.  It's certainly not your father's talk radio.  Line of the Day is brought to you by Bodog.
