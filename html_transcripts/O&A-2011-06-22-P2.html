<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony "After O&A Live" show, hosted by Sam Roberts and Club Soda Kenny, with Roland and Mars also present, began with jovial banter among the hosts about their roles within the station.  Kenny recounted a poorly received interview with two "Mob Wives," self-deprecatingly admitting his lack of assertive questioning. The hosts engaged in further self-deprecating humor, recounting past career blunders and comparing their current situations. A joke was conceived but ultimately scrapped due to Eric’s objection. Opie's absence, attributed to a management meeting, fueled speculation amongst the hosts.  The conversation then turned to the show's interns, mostly deemed incompetent, with the exception of Sam Roberts.

A substantial portion of the broadcast centered on a graphic clip of a listener, "Sergeant Magoo," participating in and violently vomiting during an eggnog drinking contest. The hosts and staff reacted with a mixture of disgust and amusement.  Guests Tom Papa (who praised Opie's YouTube videos) and Michael Potts (who found amusement in Eric’s earlier criticism) also reacted to the clip.

Further discussion revolved around Opie's YouTube videos and varied opinions on his editing skills.  A clip of Jay Mohr interviewing a retired Islanders player was mentioned, along with a planned segment featuring Carson Daly. The show also revisited past incidents, including the infamous "baby bird" incident.

Ron Bennington joined the show, discussing his controversial return and his perceived involvement in station conflicts.  Reggie the florist was announced as the replacement for the "burned out" D-Man as a co-host.  The show concluded with an interview with Weird Al Yankovic.  This interview covered his parody creation process, his relationship with Lady Gaga and her management regarding the "Perform This Way" parody, his ongoing popularity, his creative process, and his connection with his fans. The broadcast ended with promotional announcements for the main Opie and Anthony show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  It's After Opie and Anthony.  I didn't turn your mic on yet.  All right, it's on.  Oh, thanks, Sam.  Ruin it for the listeners.  I didn't ruin anything for any listeners.  You did ruin it.  This is After Opie and Anthony Live.  With your host, Club Soda Kenny. 
[00:00:30]  Club Soda Kenny is still here for some reason.  Roland's hanging out.  Mars isn't hard at work as usual, right, Roland?  What'd you say, Sam?  Facebook.com?  What's Facebook?  Yeah, Facebook.com slash Club Soda Kenny.  If you can get your plug out, you're free to do it.  Hey, Sam, I'm going to be spinning at Pennsylvania at the 675 bar.  Anyone else at Mars, your plugs?  That's Detroit.  Have good.  Good.  You know why?  No.  You're a good employee.  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  You know?  This isn't the plug show.  This is After Opie and Anthony Live.  Mars plugs jujitsu.  What do you mean he plugs jujitsu?  That's what he does.  What's going on outside the studio right now?  I don't see anything.  Somebody's talking to him.  There is a little meeting going on right now, but I'm sure...  Sam, don't you have anything better to say?  Like what?  This is a show about what's going on around us.  I'm standing right next to you.  Talk about me.  Why would I talk about you? 
[00:01:30]  Why wouldn't you?  In three or five minutes, a special guest is coming in.  Is that right?  Yep.  Is that confirmed?  Confirmed.  Because yesterday we had the Mob Wives on the show.  Yeah.  Only two of them.  And you asked.  I wasn't happy with that interview.  I've got to be honest with you.  Talk to me about that.  Let me ask for you though, Kenny.  No, they didn't.  I know.  They like me.  Talk to me about it.  No, because you did some kind of safe, watered down, generic.  You stuttered and stammered through the interview instead of asking like, where's the other  two broads? 
[00:02:00]  Well, the other two weren't here.  Yeah, that's why you ask them because they're fighting.  I sound like the Ron and Fez interns are so scared.  Oh God, the Ron and Fez interns are right there as Opie is talking to management.  Well, I only had them for literally two minutes.  I didn't prepare for it.  They just walked in.  I know.  Well, that's the difference between me and you.  See, I go with the flow.  No, you go with the flow if by the flow means go fetch coffee when the boss asks you.  That's what you go with.  Oh. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, all right.  That's part of my job description.  Yeah.  Oh.  I can't help it.  That's what they pay me immensely for.  They give you good money.  Yeah, you're on.  They pay you more than Sam, right?  Getting that coffee?  Well, I would hope so.  He's got a family.  He used to be a police officer.  I mean, I don't have a shamed career.  A shamed career?  Yeah.  I wasn't thrown off my career.  Yes, I left in disgrace. 
[00:03:00]  Although, I'll tell you this.  I also don't have a classy picture with the big American flag behind me.  You know what I mean?  At least you came out with that.  That was printed in the New York Times.  Yeah.  So at least you come out with that, Kenny.  Yeah.  Look on the positive.  Plus, everybody sees how you looked when you had that sweet mustache.  Yeah.  And you don't have a son that is Airman of the Week in the United States Air Force.  Without an ounce of body fat.  Yeah, I have a little problem with that.  I was walking into the studio earlier on the show, coming from the bathroom, and you and 
[00:03:30]  Mars were outside talking.  I guess I found out later the pictures you were showing Mars were of your son.  But you're sitting there, and you're saying, hey, Mars, look at him, and not an ounce of fat on him.  Yeah, but we're not homophobic.  I'm not saying you're homophobic.  I'm saying you're homosexual.  No, no.  We're real men.  Be careful, Tracy.  It's not a hateful remark, but two men who are looking at a picture. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah, two men acting like men.  You're talking about how...  Eric.  No, really.  No, leave him out of it.  That's another thing, Sam.  I was texting you jokes yesterday, and you don't even say them.  What didn't I say?  A joke.  You said it's crossing the line.  What was it?  What was it, Mr. Ball?  It's still crossing the line.  Mr. Guts, what was it, big man?  Does Eric want me to say it or not?  Of course not.  I have the sense to know that, but you go ahead.  Eric, do you want me to talk about it?  I would prefer you didn't. 
[00:04:30]  Okay, then I won't.  Look at that, big shot.  I respect his wishes.  No, he's not telling you.  You've got to call him.  Let me tell you something.  Your bosses are leaving.  There's nothing different between talking about fornication or connyalingus.  Connyalingus.  Get out of here.  Goodbye.  Your bosses are leaving.  You better run and catch them.  Like, Kenny's supposed to drive Opie and Jim home, and they just walked out without him.  He's just, now he's running, because he needed his little airtime.  Those running pheasant interns can come in here and set up while I'm in here.  Don't they know the drill?  You come on in.  They're scared.  Are they? 
[00:05:00]  I wonder if they'll spill any dirt about what was happening out there.  That would be the end of an internship.  Running pheasant interns, you can always set up the studio while I'm in here.  It's like, you're not going to have time to do it while I'm off, so you might as  well just go to it, you know?  I don't want to bother you, man.  Was it awkward out there while Opie was getting talked to by a certain person?  I mean, it was a little.  You could see his face like he didn't want to be there.  What did they talk about?  We weren't trying to listen in, because they kind of give us dirty looks.  Okay, they're smart.  You know what I mean?  Not to ever say that. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  Which one of you did the Fez song?  I'm an intern with no name, apparently.  Good job on that song.  Thanks.  Opie, it sent Opie into a rant about how we don't have interns.  Now, interns can do good things, but I reminded him, at the Opie and Anthony show, we've never  had an intern who was capable of anything that anybody would call good.  I mean, Mars, you know that.  Well, there is an exceptional intern that we had, and that's Sam Roberts.  Thank you for stopping me, Mars, because why would I compliment myself when you'll do 
[00:06:00]  it for me?  There wasn't one, I have to say.  There wasn't one?  No, one fucking one.  Not even like, well, I guess Eric never was.  Eric.  Yeah.  Since me, I was the last intern to get hired.  Has there been an Opie and Anthony intern that was good at all?  Today, Eric.  I'm thinking.  I never considered you an intern, because you were always there every day.  Yeah.  I didn't slack.  These other interns slack.  Because you kind of gelled in with everybody. 
[00:06:30]  What about David?  David was a good intern.  How come you guys can't be more like intern David?  Not Jewy enough, really.  Well, that's totally uncalled for.  Maybe you guys should set up the studio and just stop with this hate speech.  Yeah, we'll just set up.  Yeah, I mean, I'm sorry that intern with no name, you were so poorly represented by this  other guy.  I don't even know who he is.  Eric, you got off pretty much scot-free today.  A little bashing in the beginning of the interview, but pretty much scot-free. 
[00:07:00]  You feeling okay?  I have a little story about that.  Hang on one sec.  Eric, are you feeling okay?  Yeah, I'm feeling fine.  Are you feeling better today than you have been this week?  I feel as good as I do every day working here.  Okay, so I'll take that for what it's worth.  Roland?  Right when Eric played The Wire theme, Michael Potts was in our office signing the release  form.  And then he goes, where's Michael Potts?  And he goes, I'm over here.  And then he heard him yelling at Eric, and he stopped, and he goes, I want to listen to 
[00:07:30]  this, and he was laughing.  Oh, wow.  I thought you were going to see, most celebrities would be like, oh, let me go save Eric.  So he was sitting there.  He really did fit in with O&A.  He goes, hold on, let me listen to this.  He goes, hehehehe.  Eric, you hear that?  Michael Potts was even smashing you this week.  Yeah, I didn't do anything, so good.  Tom Papa was the other guest, Roland.  And I saw the look on Opie's face.  He was very happy that a celebrity like Tom Papa, out of nowhere, unsolicited, was complimenting 
[00:08:00]  his videos so nicely.  Why are you pointing at your head?  Oh, I don't know.  Oh, yeah.  He loves his videos.  How come you were just pointing at your head and winking at me?  I wasn't.  I was itching my head.  Well, Tom Papa did like...  I drank a lot last night.  You did.  I haven't slept.  You haven't?  I have not.  Then you're lucky that the guest ended up well today, because otherwise it would have  been another Roland breakdown with no sleep.  No, not a breakdown.  I'm just like...  I'm just...  Opie, Opie, he told me that the reason Tom Papa liked 
[00:08:30]  that video so much.  The one that he did...  First of all, there's the one from yesterday that he posted, which he's now convinced is  either Fez or Robin Williams in the park, which would explain where Fez has been, because  I listened to Ron and Fez yesterday.  No trace of Fez.  The D-man was in the house, tearing it down, but no trace of Fez.  So that would explain...  If that's Fez, if he has a yellow beard and he's dancing in the park, that would explain  a lot, or Robin Williams. 
[00:09:00]  Probably Fez.  You think so?  His other video is the one that Tom Papa was raving about, and Opie told me that the reason  that Tom Papa was raving about it was because of his quote...  This is Opie's word.  His prowess as an editor.  His editing prowess.  Or editing genius.  You say genius.  Opie says prowess.  Well, Eric is an editing genius, too.  What are you talking about?  Well, he's a genius.  He does...  Audio editing, not video editing. 
[00:09:30]  I say both.  Well, I've seen his videos.  He's not good with the videos.  Well, I say both.  Okay.  Eric?  Yeah?  How are you with audio editing and video editing?  Um, pretty good.  With video editing, too?  Um, I'm getting there.  I'm not, like, at your level, but I'm learning.  Because, I mean, the ones you posted on YouTube weren't great.  Yeah, but that's also shitty ones that I was learning to edit.  Well, maybe you should have kept those to yourself, then.  Well, why don't you go fuck yourself?  Okay, fair enough.  Opie, when Opie said prowess, I was surprised. 
[00:10:00]  I had no idea that Opie knew words like prowess.  He has trouble with a lot of words sometimes.  Maybe it's like a kiss here in a box, like the word of the day.  You think so?  Like when he learned, like the time that he thought he had read something in the newspaper  and it came off a placement.  Yep.  Well, I don't know what it was, but you should check out the videos at YouTube  slash Opie Radio, uh, if you haven't seen them yet.  Um, I did want to play something.  Eric, what do you think we should start with?  Because there was a couple of, uh, do we have Froot Loops ready?  Uh, Froot Loops is ready.  Okay. 
[00:10:30]  We have the other thing ready.  And, um, our friends over at, uh, NHL sent us over a clip that I'm going through right  now.  I guess Jay Moore was doing stuff at the NHL awards and, uh, he was speaking to, uh, is  the guy's name wait, Doug wait, Doug wait, he's a retired player, assistant coach, something  like that for the Islanders.  And, uh, Jay had Doug addressed to Opie about the problems with the Islanders.  So I'm, I'm going to go through it right now.  You think it's going to be good for the, all right.  And we have another guest tonight, today, Roland? 
[00:11:00]  We have a guest today.  And today is Carson Daly's birthday.  Wait, more stuff from The Voice?  I love The Voice.  I know you do.  We're going to play this because, uh, in the top of the show, uh, management came up in  conversation again, which I'm assuming is what Opie was talking about, uh, after the  show.  Um, he, we were talking all together about, uh, whether or not we were allowed to play,  uh, vomit clips, uh, what we were allowed to do and not allowed to do.  We found, we are allowed to play vomit clips and it came up. 
[00:11:30]  Everybody's forgotten since the baby bird was such a runaway success, an iconic moment in  the history of the Opie and Anthony show.  Nobody realized that one of our fans whose name is Sergeant Magoo, I don't know if that's  his real name, uh, but I believe it is Sergeant Magoo ate some fruit.  Fruit Loops with milk, then regurgitated the Fruit Loops and milk, then ate the regurgitated  Fruit Loops and milk, then regurgitated the regurgitated Fruit Loops and milk.  It was all horrifying to witness. 
[00:12:00]  It was disgusting to re-edit again.  Oh, you just, cause you just had to shorten it up for us.  Do you remember all the fans in K-Rock that they had in the hallways to get that smell out?  Yeah, the fans and then they had somebody come in to, uh, clean the carpets.  We did a lot of stuff in that K-Rock studio that really smelled the joint up.  Um, but this was, uh, a shock and a horror, and we did, at the time, this was before the  baby bird had happened, so we thought that this was going to be the moment of the day.  This was gonna be, it was outshined, unfortunately, but there's no reason why we can't shine the 
[00:12:30]  light on it one more time.  Right here on After Opie and Anthony Live, this is Sgt. Magoo and his puke fruit, I almost  said fruit roll-ups, his puke Fruit Loops.  Yeah, play it.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  Jimmy, do you mind if they stand over here to check out the rest of the game?  Magoo is, uh, teetering?  No.  I thought when she bent over to puke, it was gonna fall off.  All right.  As long as they stand back a little bit.  Uh-oh.  All right, where are we at?  Magoo is teetering.  He's gotta get that shot down.  We're up to the 24th double shot of eggnog. 
[00:13:00]  Sgt. Magoo is making his way to the, uh, to the, uh, bucket.  All right.  He has a pitcher in his hand.  He's trying.  The bar's been raised so high now.  Yeah.  That was amazing.  That was all in him?  I couldn't believe it.  I know.  It kept coming like that.  It just...  That was like, what, like 11?  I think he puked up every shot that he drank.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Individually.  Yeah, individually.  That's what I'm trying to say.  That's impossible.  Someone's gotta count that for us.  I think he puked like 10 to 12 individual times there. 
[00:13:30]  They were all gems.  They were all doozies.  Wait till you see the video of that one.  I want that to replace my old puked sound effects.  And people are gonna be confused.  They're gonna go, that guy had to have been one of the, uh, the last guys standing.  Uh, what do we got?  Magoo.  Sgt. Magoo, how you feeling?  I'm feeling a little queasy.  All right.  Well...  How many...  Shot.  Shot.  There we go.  Another one coming out.  What are we up to?  Chit-chat.  All right, guys.  This is the 25th double shot of eggnog in the eggnog drinking contest. 
[00:14:00]  What's the record?  71.  71.  71.  Magoo put that one right down.  Oh!  Oh, he's puking.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  He's puking into the pitcher.  And now you can measure it.  Oh, my God.  He's gonna fill it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, it's getting chunky.  I feel like I turn in his back.  He doesn't want to see it.  No.  Oh, my God. 
[00:14:30]  A little spittle threads all the time.  He's filling up the pitcher.  It's almost to the top.  Pitcher's full.  Oh, and the rest of them have to continue drinking.  I think we're done with the puke.  Oh, my God.  Look at all that.  That almost made me puke.  He filled, completely filled up a huge beer pitcher. 
[00:15:00]  I'm not looking.  Anthony, do you want to sip out of that pitcher that Magoo filled?  Shut up.  Magoo filled a pitcher, and I'm telling Anthony in the break that, wait, don't drink it yet.  Yeah, don't.  We got to do the big setup for this.  If you swallowed some of that, it would be warm like his stomach, but I guarantee you  there's a cool spot in there where the stuff that just went down and his stomach didn't  even warm.  You'd suck it down like an oyster.  A cool clot of nog from his stomach would slide down your throat. 
[00:15:30]  I think I'm having more fun.  You look like he's about to puke.  Dude, Joe, by the end of this, we have literally like 20, 25 people in this room.  By the end of this, there's going to be a lot of people puking.  I'm having more fun watching Anthony get a little freaked out by this whole thing.  I hate this.  Eric almost threw up.  Eric almost threw up when Sergeant Magoo was filling up the pitcher.  I always puked, too, I admit.  Did you?  You know what it was?  It's the visual of filling up something that is supposed to be sanitary.  Let me give the big setup.  We got a guy getting close to puking here. 
[00:16:00]  It's the eggnog drinking contest.  These guys have been drinking double shots of eggnog every single minute.  When you puke, you're out.  We're down to six contestants.  I think we're going to get our...  Oh, double puke.  Down goes full-blown AIDS.  Down goes full-blown AIDS.  Jesus Christ.  It's just as good coming back up. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, no.  We just lost two competitors.  He got a running start.  Oh, my God.  Out of the nose.  Look at Munaki.  He's like John Madden of Puking.  He's just doing the color commentating.  Oh, wow.  And the other guys have to do a shot.  All right.  Well, where is Sergeant Magoo?  He promised us a little thing here.  Sergeant Magoo, the field is...  The mic is yours there. 
[00:17:00]  Yes, sir.  So what do you want to do today?  Well, I know what...  I'm here to make Joe Rogan puke, maybe.  Joe, what do you think?  It's going to take a lot.  We've got a nice fine full picture here of eggnog, which I regurgitated.  Yeah.  So I figure maybe put in a little bowl of Froot Loops and we'll enjoy breakfast together.  I see the nice bowl of Froot Loops there on the table.  It needs just a little milk substance.  Oh, no.  A milky substance in there.  Look how...  Oh, my God.  Oh, God damn it.  No.  Holy Jesus. 
[00:17:30]  No, it's like...  It's pouring like molasses.  No, Anthony, it's pouring like rice pudding.  It's rice pudding or pancake batter.  Thick pancake batter.  Oh, we might lose E-Rock.  E-Rock is losing it over there.  E-Rock.  E-Rock, did you see that pour?  Turn around, E-Rock.  Get on the mic.  Oh, God.  Oh, E-Rock.  Oh, he's eating Froot Loops out of his own vomit.  E-Rock.  E-Rock, you all right?  I didn't know eggnog could clot.  Oh, my God.  Oh, there goes E-Rock. 
[00:18:00]  E-Rock, stop puking.  No.  Oh, an innocent bystander gets hit by a straight gun.  Let's make this perfectly clear.  Yes, E-Rock is not in the eggnog drinking contest.  He's one of our own.  He's just puking because he just saw Sergeant Magoo eating the Froot Loops with his own.  Oh, my God.  E-Rock looks worse than anybody in the competition.  E-Rock is so pale right now. 
[00:18:30]  His eyes are running with water.  E-Rock, look at how thick that is.  Go ahead, Magoo.  Do that again.  E-Rock, you got to look.  Oh, look, look, look.  Watch, watch, watch.  It's like snot.  Here goes E-Rock.  I almost puked.  Did you?  I had to walk away.  I had to walk away.  I almost puked.  Poor E-Rock.  If I hadn't...  Oh, we got to know.  Oh, we lost Generoso. 
[00:19:00]  Generoso.  We just lost Generoso from whackbag.com.  Sergeant Magoo is taking everybody out of the competition.  Oh, Magoo is carpet bombing.  Magoo's like a suicide bomber.  He really is.  Poor E-Rock.  Look at that.  Look at that.  Oh, look.  They're all stuck together.  It's like oyster crackers.  He's just...  Magoo, why don't you top off the Froot Loops with a little more what you got in the picture  there?  How does it take?  How's E-Rock again?  Eric is in the garbage tank. 
[00:19:30]  E-Rock is puking off a storm.  His stupid headphones are still on.  God, that is hilarious.  Take us to break, stupid.  Oh, my God.  That is hilarious.  E-Rock.  Are you all right, E-Rock?  Look, he's going to top off...  E-Rock, watch him pour.  Look, watch him pour it.  Eric can watch him pour it.  Just watch him pour it.  Look.  Look how thick.  Oh, he's in the garbage tank. 
[00:20:00]  What children?  E-Rock is puking.  He's all the way in the garbage tank.  I almost lost.  Look at it hanging off the spoon.  Look at it hanging off the spoon.  Oh, God.  It's like snot.  Sergeant Magoo continues to eat the Froot Loops with his own eggnog puke mixture that  he poured from a pitcher.  Oh.  After ONA.  Live.  You know, I think I liked the rule better when we couldn't play that.  That was disgusting.  Agreed. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  There are things that, like, I guess you just complain about rules because they exist,  but we're probably all better off not having to listen to Sergeant Magoo regurgitate over  and over again.  Roland, do you get queasy with stuff like that?  No.  Not at all, huh?  Not a bit.  Do you ever get queasy?  That's why I didn't put my headphones on to listen to it.  So you didn't get queasy at all because you didn't listen to it at all.  I didn't listen to it, no.  Does that stuff gross you out?  I can handle some of it. 
[00:21:00]  It is a certain time.  I just go, I can feel it coming up.  I throw it on my pillow.  And Eric, you had to go through this editing it, correct?  Yeah.  Now, who was in that?  Bill Burr and...  Joe Rogan.  And Joe Rogan.  Because Joe Rogan, later in the day, would go on to name the baby bird the baby...  If you don't know what the baby bird is at this point...  I think Ari was there, too.  Was Ari Shafir there?  If you don't know what the baby bird is at this point, I can't be here to give you an  O&A history lesson every day.  So look it up.  And there's video you'll find.  It's the most incredible thing you've ever seen in your life.  But after everything you've been through, sex bagel... 
[00:21:30]  Sex man.  Sex man, I'm sorry.  Do you get queasy just listening to other people puke?  Listening, like that was rough only because I was involved in it.  Yeah.  But listening to it, not any...  No, not really.  It's being around it where if I see it or smell it, it becomes a big problem.  But like listening to audio, it brings all the memories back, you're saying?  Yeah, it's painful.  Because it really was disgusting that day.  Very much.  Were you there, Roland? 
[00:22:00]  Yep.  When it was the big...  That was the eggnog drinking contest.  Yeah, I was there.  There was bags all over the floor.  Then somebody took a shit in the bathroom.  That smelled even worse.  Not being able to do the eggnog contest is probably the best thing that's ever happened  to this show.  Oh, yeah.  At least for us.  Just that smell of vomit at 7.30 in the morning.  Big scary shit.  Oh, big...  Oh, okay.  I'm getting sick again.  This is absolutely disgusting.  Interesting.  I saw Sandy Cain out in Times Square the other day.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:22:30]  That's how I knew she was going to be on America's Got Talent.  I guess she's going to be on America's Got Talent tonight.  Definitely Jump a Shark.  What, the show or her?  By booking her there.  Well, I don't know if they booked her.  She probably just went and tried out and they decided to put her on TV.  Is that show live or is it taped?  Well, I think they're still in the audition phases.  Yeah.  So the audition parts are taped and then the competition is live.  Because I was wondering, remember we couldn't find her for a while?  She wasn't in Times Square?  Yeah.  She's probably out auditioning, I guess. 
[00:23:00]  Okay.  How'd she get the money out of LA?  She, I don't know, because she wouldn't have gotten any money for her naked cowboy lawsuit  because she won, but she was the defendant, so she just didn't have to pay him.  Maybe somebody's funding her.  Who knows?  But I'm sure that she didn't make it onto the show.  I mean, otherwise you'd think she'd still be there.  She's out in Times Square in her underwear.  That's why I was asking if it was live.  Because if it's live, she hasn't gone there yet.  She has to go out there and do it again.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe once they go live, she goes back out there if they pick her. 
[00:23:30]  I'm sure they won't.  You wouldn't think they could possibly.  Can you picture a production company or a network having to send a car in a first class  or in a hotel?  Sandy Kane is a woman.  And if you haven't seen her, definitely put her into Google Image or YouTube when you  get a chance, because she's been on the show multiple times.  She's been a part of the Opie and Anthony show for years.  She wanted to come back this week, and we were like, yeah, no, I don't think so.  She wanted to come in tomorrow.  She did?  Yeah.  That's why I just laughed at her.  We're booked up. 
[00:24:00]  We got guests tomorrow.  We got too much going on right now.  Eventually, we'll have Sandy Kane back in, because she does hold a spot in our hearts.  Maybe July 4th.  We're not on July 4th, Roland.  She is an elderly woman.  She's got to be in her late 60s, possibly early 70s.  Every part of her skin is sagging and wrinkling.  Very porous.  Very porous.  However, she still wears very few clothing, very little clothing, bikini, bra and panties, 
[00:24:30]  cowboy boots.  That's kind of her outfit.  In more recent years, she's decided that she's a singer, and she stole the naked cowboy's gimmick,  started dancing around Times Square as the naked cowgirl.  You may have seen her in the papers and everything.  But we saw her, and it reminded us.  We were talking about the appearance today on the air, the America's Got Talent appearance. 
[00:25:00]  And I was thinking about all of her appearances on the show.  Do you have a favorite Sandy Kane appearance, E-Rock?  Oh, there's been a few.  Smash of the guitar.  You like that.  The video's online.  I'm sure you can find it if you search it out.  There was one where we were throwing old gravy and beans over her.  That's what I was going to get to.  This one that Roland's talking about, though, is the Homeless Talent Show,  where Sandy Kane, we invited her up to do some stand-up material in front of the homeless guys,  and right behind her back, Opie took her guitar and smashed it in pure Opie form. 
[00:25:30]  She stopped doing the show for almost a year at that point because she was so furious.  Opie gave her money for a new guitar.  Of course, she didn't buy one.  She just covered the hole in the guitar with bumper stickers and pocketed the cash.  But Opie gave her the cash because he does have a heart somewhere.  Was that the same time as when he cut her strings?  Or was that a separate time?  No, the time he cut her strings, and this is what I want to play.  We have that quick clip of it, right?  Yeah, but I'm thinking it's the one that we cut her strings. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, that's what I want to play, the one where we cut her strings.  What had happened was it was back when we were on 57th Street, and we invited her up.  We had a studio audience and everything, and if I remember correctly, she was sitting in a chair,  which we still have, one of these chairs right here that we have in studio,  playing her guitar, doing one of her dumb songs where she sings about penises.  Twato.  And Twato.  And Opie came up behind her and took a pair of scissors and snipped her guitar strings as she was playing them. 
[00:26:30]  Following that, we took several condiments and poured them on her head.  I mean, it was a scene out of Carrie.  It was an absolute horror show, and it was the type of thing that could theoretically drive a person absolutely out of her mind.  Luckily, Sandy Cain already is.  You got the clip, Eric?  Yes, I do.  Okay.  This is it.  Sandy Cain getting destroyed. 
[00:27:00]  This is from what, 2008?  2007?  Oh, Jesus.  I don't even know.  I think it's 2008.  Okay, so it's three or four years ago.  Yeah, May 2008.  2008.  My favorite Sandy Cain memory, and I hope yours, too, right here on After ONA Live.  I used to live in Nashville, Tennessee.  That's where I caught VD.  And you know what?  I also lived in Miami. 
[00:27:30]  Are you Jewish?  I'm not playing that.  Twice.  No, keep going, sir.  Okay, uh, okay.  Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, and I'm going to be on...  Oh, oh, and it seems Opie has taken scissors and cut all of Sandy Cain's strings.  Oh, that, uh, that's going to leave a mark. 
[00:28:00]  Sandy, let me see.  Boy, that really, uh, that improved the sound.  I mean, that really...  Roland, can you imagine you're trying to be a performer, you're not being taken seriously,  and then somebody goes to the effort of actually snipping the strings from your guitar as you're performing.  I thought she was...  She, like, I think she cried, though, too. 
[00:28:30]  She did.  And now, we took her wig off, we poured condiments on her, and then the interns physically picked her chair up and removed her from the studio.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, it was a horrible thing to do.  That's awesome.  But for some reason, we're all still laughing about it.  Um, today, it was three years ago, did you say, Eric?  I'm sorry?  Three years ago today for, uh, our, uh, former guest?  Three years ago today was the death of comedian great George Carlin. 
[00:29:00]  Uh, he had a major impact on, you know, guys like Norton and everybody who came up.  Every comedian you talk to holds him in such a great regard.  We were lucky that just about a year before he died, uh, we got to sit down and talk to him.  Uh, he did the N.E.W. show a whole bunch of times, but it was a year before he died, he came into K-Rock, and, uh, we talked to him.  This is just a little, this is a part of it, because he ended up staying for, like, an hour, right?  Yeah, he came by himself.  Once I booked him, he just said, I'll come by myself. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, he just showed up by himself.  Yeah, he said, I'll do a half hour if I like you guys, I'll stay longer.  And this is a guy who's been in entertainment for, I mean, what, 40, 50 years?  Like, an icon.  And, you know, you got people like Paris Hilton, who's walking in here with eight people around her.  Florentine got a picture with her at, uh, Lopez tonight.  Oh, did he?  Of course.  Rules.  But Paris Hilton, who's famous for nothing, is coming in here with, like, eight people around her.  And then you have an icon like George Carlin, who's just like, yeah, I'll come by.  And he comes up, he gets in the elevator by himself, he walks in like a human being, 
[00:30:00]  and he stayed for an hour, because he was having a good time.  This is just a part of, uh, the interview that we did with him in 2007 in K-Rock.  2007.  2007.  We've been here a long time, Roland.  In memory of the great George Carlin, here he is on the ONA show on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  Can I say one of my favorite things, uh, is that, I was just thinking in the break,  you've never become pompous as a comedian. 
[00:30:30]  Like, like, I love so much the fact that your subject matter.  I mean, it's, it's by far the most brilliant, uh, social commentary that any comic's doing.  But then there's also, like, silly things and fart jokes.  It's never become too hip for the room.  Um, it's just whatever is funny to you.  Yeah.  The room was never hip anyway.  The room was always lame.  I was always hipper than the room.  Even when I was a kid.  But, yeah, George could go real deep and real silly.  Like, you know, your whole thing on moving and stuff and that whole, I love that bit. 
[00:31:00]  There were three areas, actually, four areas now that I kind of draw from.  Language itself, just for its own sake, talking about words and phrases and stuff.  Words hurt, George.  We had to read a pamphlet here to do our radio show.  A whole pamphlet.  I didn't mean to interrupt you, but you just brought up some of that.  I'm just now understanding what you meant.  I think you would appreciate this.  That's why I jumped in here.  We, uh, with the political correctness and stuff, they handed out this pamphlet about how words hurt.  Called Words Hurt.  And we had to read different stereotypes and how they're used and we shouldn't use them. 
[00:31:30]  And, you know, we're at a point now on regular radio where I can't go into Chinatown  and speak to somebody and then convey the conversation here using the accent of the Asian gentleman  because an Asian group will write in and say, I'm doing a stereotypical accent.  No, I'm, I'm imitating the guy at the store I was at.  Yeah.  You know, you can't say that.  I could go, I could go to any other store and go, yeah, I was talking to a salesman and he said, 
[00:32:00]  well, that shirt looks a little big on you.  That's right.  I can do that, but I can't talk about how the egg foo young isn't done yet.  Right, so, so this Words Hurt, it was a pamphlet, we read every word on the air.  Really, yeah.  And made a huge joke out of it and then we get in trouble for making a joke out of it.  We're like, you're going to drive us insane.  We can't take this stuff seriously in, in, in what we're doing on, on our radio show.  Words have become so, um, yeah, so empowered.  People have become very, very nervous. 
[00:32:30]  Where are the four places you draw from though?  Uh, well, English language, um, social commentary kind of, I think that's the best word.  For some of that stuff because it's not political really, more like social and, um, silliness,  you know, uh, and, um, observations, you know, like about stuff, things, things that universalities,  things we all know.  And, uh, and therefore you have half the job is done with the audience because they already  know the premise and all you have to do is kind of like then take care of business. 
[00:33:00]  I think I started throwing stuff away after, uh, listening to your stuff bit.  Like, you know, we just collect stuff that just means it's, it's nonsense.  Well, if there's an interesting thing about something that someone gives you, um, you know,  you, you, you, it's very hard.  And like a year after your aunt gave you a bad looking clock or a, or a dumb thing for  a lamp, a year later, two years later, 10 years later, it's really easy to be in storage  and say, get that out. 
[00:33:30]  That goes in the big pile over on the left.  That's going to Salvation Army or Goodwill or whatever.  But you, you know, what's really hard to do?  Throw it away the same day she gave it to you and it's the same clock and you feel the  same way about it, but your conscience won't let you take it and put it in the dumpster  when she leaves the house.  It's very interesting.  Enough time has to pass and then you feel, okay, I can throw this away now.  You're so right.  That's really right.  Throw it out with the gift wrapping still on us.  That's right.  Yeah.  Say, just so much of meet me in the back, meet me back by the garbage cans when you get to 
[00:34:00]  the house because I got on it and make it easy for both of us.  I throw stuff away now and people get outraged like, you just got that for your birthday.  I'm like, yeah, they will never know that I just threw their stuff out.  Maybe that's where they're getting this stuff.  Yeah.  Going through the dumpsters.  What is it about just the passage of time that makes certain things okay when immediately  it's just not?  I was brought up the Titanic, you know, being just a horrific thing. 
[00:34:30]  A ship sinks, kills thousands.  Now they sink.  And then, yeah, you fast forward a few years, relatively speaking, a blink of an eye, and  there's an inflatable ride at kids' parties that is shaped like the Titanic sinking into  the lawn with a hose and little kids slide down the deck and it's like, now it's a ride.  And they give you some smokestacks too so the kids can bounce off the smokestacks.  Yeah, they can bounce off the smokestacks and you're like, this was a horrible tragedy 
[00:35:00]  where people died in horrifically painful ways, but enough time goes by and it's a kiddie  ride now.  And they wonder why it's all ending.  Yeah.  What's wrong with our country?  That's why after 9-11, I brought up that same thing.  I go, how much time has to pass before they have a ride based on that horrific disaster?  And then people call up, hey, hey, hey, what do you say?  You're sick.  Well, the Titanic. 
[00:35:30]  Come on, you don't think those people had family, friends, loved ones?  And now it's a kiddie ride.  Enough time goes by, people just seem to want to forget it.  And it's all different people.  Yeah, yeah.  It's all different.  All different people.  And I've also found that it's okay to show dead people if they're far away or if it's  old in black and white.  Like old World War II stuff, it's fine.  You could show Japanese people just burned to a crisp from a flamethrower.  And you can show dead people now as long as they're a certain few miles away. 
[00:36:00]  You can't show them here.  Like they won't show American dead people in a car wreck or shooting.  And the newscast tells me, you may, this coming, the footage we're going to show may be too  graphic for you.  Yeah.  And I think, not for me.  Oh my God, it couldn't be.  Not again.  History's repeating itself, I guess. 
[00:36:30]  Because the great Ron Bennington has returned to after Opie and Anthony Live.  A lot of people said it would never happen.  You know, this is a very controversial show to come back to also.  Why is that?  Well, between you here and Special Delivery, there's a lot of people who are, of course,  as you probably know, mad at you.  The, you know, staring up shit thing.  What are they mad at me for?  Well, I don't want to get into details because that just restores shit.  But everybody's figured out that you're in the middle of everything. 
[00:37:00]  People like my friend Roland, Jay Moore is also into it now.  A lot of people now have picked up on what's happening.  I'm in the middle of everything?  Yeah.  Yeah, you are.  I don't know if that's, I mean, if I can take all the credit.  Well, you have a way of, you're like the Pierce Morgan of this place right now.  But you go for trash and you enjoy it and you're into it.  And I don't know everything that happened between Ryan and Tatum O'Neal.  I just hope the two of them work out well today.  I saw there were some tears. 
[00:37:30]  There's going to be tears in that show.  A big, big show today on the Ryan and Faye show.  Reggie the florist joins our show.  What?  As my permanent co-host.  What happened to the D-Man?  D-Man burned out during the show yesterday.  Started very, very strong.  Everybody loved him.  And then there was a certain, I can only call it psychic wall, that he hit.  Well, I mean, it's his first opportunity at radio and some people just aren't cut out.  Four hours is a lot.  It's not like one of these once a week, one hour podcasts.  Right. 
[00:38:00]  That people do.  I mean, he just walked in thinking he could handle it and the D-Man can't hang.  This is something the podcasters don't know.  They think, hey, if I go on once a week with seven of my friends and we have fun, I'm doing radio.  Is that what the D-Man was doing?  I don't know what he was doing.  He's a mystery right now.  And who did you say was the new co-host?  I think it's Reginald the florist.  Shouldn't it be Reginald the radio show host?  No.  This is something Chris Stanley knows him.  Chris Stanley put this all together. 
[00:38:30]  Chris Stanley knows a florist?  Yeah.  Chris Stanley goes in all different fucking realms.  You don't understand him.  Wow.  Well, I mean.  He knows drug dealers.  He knows people who work at liquor stores.  He knows Liam.  Come on in.  Bring him in.  This is gigantic.  This is incredible.  We had the Mob Wives on yesterday.  And I think, is this really going to happen right now?  He's outside.  He's coming in.  It's Weird Al Yagervick, everybody. 
[00:39:00]  I can't believe it.  I'll see you.  Nice to see you.  Weird Al.  Have a seat.  Thank you.  Just over here?  Yeah, sure.  My name is Sam Roberts.  This is Ron Bennington.  I know Ron.  Good to see you, man.  Yes, nice to meet you.  Weird Al did a, unmasked with me.  Ah.  One hour, slayed for an hour.  Really?  That was a lot of fun.  You, dude, you are so fucking fast.  And I would like to say it to so many of the comedians who come and do that show, who  are edgy and hip and have no idea how fucking quick you are. 
[00:39:30]  You're mine.  Seriously.  He's never off balance.  What happens to him?  And he's also, like, you've managed to stay topical for how long now?  Oh, weeks now.  I mean.  It has been weeks.  I remember, like, three, four weeks ago.  How do you know?  People were saying, this Weird Al's real thing.  He's seriously.  But how do you know how to stay relevant?  Like, how do you know what to parody today?  You just, you know, keep your finger on the proverbial pulse and check the charts and 
[00:40:00]  listen to the radio and, you know, bombard yourself with pop culture.  He never parodies non-hits.  That's a really bright thing that he's come up with.  Just turn on Top 40 and whatever's there.  Yeah, I have all these great parodies of Pancreas, Joe, and the Eskimo Lipsists, and I just  think, I don't put those out.  It would be a mistake.  Yeah.  But I do remember you saying that you would not write a parody song until you had approval,  and then I saw with this Lady Gaga thing you had already done the parody.  Well, here's the thing.  Normally, I wouldn't have done that.  What happened was I approached the Gaga camp with a concept, which is what I always do. 
[00:40:30]  You know, I had like a one-paragraph thing, like, I want to do a parody of Born This Way  called Perform This Way.  It's going to be a lampoon of Gaga's bigger-than-life persona and poking fun at her without being  disrespectful and, you know, as a whole kind of treatment.  And basically, what we heard back was, well, Gaga needs to hear the song.  And I thought, you need to see the lyrics.  Okay, well, I understood.  You know, she's a huge star, and she doesn't want to take any chances, so I, you know, spent  a week and wrote the lyrics and gave them to him. 
[00:41:00]  And what we heard back was, no, no, she needs to hear the song.  Like, you know, here's the lyrics.  You know how the song goes.  If you put them together in your head, that's it.  But, you know, normally I don't go into a studio and spend all that time and effort and money  to record something if I don't have permission.  But it basically was an ultimatum, like, if you don't hear it, we're not going to give  your permission.  And then I recorded it, and they still said no.  Now, did she hear it, or did her people?  Here's the thing. 
[00:41:30]  It was always presented to us like, oh, it's Gaga's decision.  We've got to run it by her.  And it turns out they never ran it by her.  It was all her manager, and it was him making the unilateral decision that they didn't want  me to do it.  And after he said no, I was, you know, normally, normally you'd never get to that stage.  I would never record the song without permission.  But since I had, and he said no, it was like, all right, you know, I spent like the last  month working on this thing, and a considerable amount of money in the studio, I'm putting  this on YouTube.  I put it up, I put out a blog explaining the whole Gaga saga, and within like a day, like 
[00:42:00]  it had like two million hits.  And people were cracking down Lady Gaga on the street, like, how come you're not letting  Al do this song?  And she had no clue.  She's like, I'm an Al fan.  What are you talking about?  And there was news to her, and she turned it around and got permission.  But that's the crazy thing, is like, your fans are so rabid after all these years.  That thing blew up everywhere on the internet in one day.  She had to quick spin so she wasn't bad guy. 
[00:42:30]  You know what I mean?  And she did a great job of it.  This kid doesn't fuck up.  She really does.  You know what I mean?  She really does have this massive star thing down.  So she turned it into like a good story within 48 hours.  She turned into, hey, Lady Gaga is good.  She's just surrounded by awful people.  I don't know what actually happened, but that's the way it's been.  I choose to believe that.  But it's really, I mean, it worked out well for her too, don't you think?  I think, yeah.  Because it actually was, you know, for a couple hours there, it was like kind of ugly. 
[00:43:00]  Right.  Like people, even like hardcore Lady Gaga fans were like, what's up with this?  Right.  Has there ever been a case where one of your songs has not worked out well for somebody?  You know, you're not a very vicious performer with your parodies.  That's the thing.  I mean, the parodies are all, you know, they're not mean-spirited, certainly.  And if you look at it from a pure bottom line financial thing, like the original artists  sell more records or downloads or whatever, it's always like better for them.  So it all depends if you have enough of a sense of humor to, you know, to take a joke about it.  Who, who, I just got Eric. 
[00:43:30]  Eric, this is Sex Bagel.  He's on the board right there.  Hello.  He is.  That's just his CompuServe name, though, isn't it?  That's the only place he uses it.  I didn't know it was just CompuServe.  He's the biggest Weird Al fan, possibly, that works at SiriusXM, maybe the world.  I don't know.  But he's a giant Weird Al fan.  And he's whispering questions into my ear like he's not capable of just asking himself.  Oh, just ask.  He's nervous.  Well, you're saying the song's not being vicious.  It didn't start out this way, but that James Blunt parody that you did?  Yeah.  When I saw you in concert, because he had a big problem with you doing that, turned into it being a big thing against him where you were flipping off the shirt saying how much he sucks and all that. 
[00:44:00]  Well, not him.  Not him.  I need to point that out.  James Blunt did not disallow the parody.  James Blunt was cool.  It was his record label, Atlantic Records, that had a problem and didn't want me to put out You're Pitiful.  So, you know, and I just stopped doing the song in concert, but I used to do like a striptease, like, you know, James Blunt did in his music video.  So I start with a jacket and then a sequined shirt and then a couple of gag shirts. 
[00:44:30]  And the last one of the last shirts is a shirt that says Atlantic Records sucks.  Eric, if you could get into my head for a second, E-Rock Sex Bagel, he as I'm talking to you, he just goes, James Blunt, as if I was sitting at the concert with him and knew the whole story to ask you.  He just saw broadcast news where that producer sits there and runs everything.  Eric, are you nervous that Weird Al is here?  It's a big honor.  I told you. 
[00:45:00]  Well, he's a radio guy.  He grew up in radio and Weird Al has dominated radio for decades.  And one of his albums was the second record I ever bought in my life.  Which one is that one?  That would be the vinyl Eat It.  Wow.  Nice.  What was the first record you ever bought?  The first one was He's the DJ, I'm the Rapper by Fresh Prince.  That should be everybody's first.  Is it weird that you, as a parody artist, have become the end-all, be-all for people like you? 
[00:45:30]  Like what I was just talking about, you have a rabid fan base when it's hard to differentiate whether you're a comedian or you're not a traditional artist, a song maker.  Yeah, it kind of boggles my mind.  I mean, you know, I'm just here like trying to have some laughs and do my silly thing.  But there's a lot of people that are, you know, very taken by it and on the verge of being obsessed.  I mean, I might have talked during our interview before.  There's like several dozen people on this planet that have Weird Al tattoos. 
[00:46:00]  It's like a big thing.  But, you know, parody is always and satire is always important.  The Onion News is gigantic now.  It's gigantic.  Some people go there before the news.  So it makes total sense to me.  And in this, like, you see now that YouTube is everybody's trying to get the next YouTube video out.  Everybody does parodies now.  But there's nobody who's managed to get more than one successful parody YouTube video except you.  Do you watch and know when you see this YouTube video pop up?  You're like, this guy is not going to be able to sustain. 
[00:46:30]  You know, I used to kind of keep tabs on all the parodies on YouTube, but, you know, it was kind of freaking me out because, you know, I always wanted to be like original or be the first person to do a parody of a given song.  And that's never going to happen again.  I mean, the people on YouTube are just going to have more immediacy than I am.  Because you're writing letters to record labels and they're just some kid who's got the karaoke track and singing over it.  Exactly.  Exactly.  If they have the karaoke track, sometimes they just sing right over the song.  So I just kind of have to put the blinders on now and not do any Google searches and just like, you know, pretend like I'm not the 20th, 20,000th person to do a Miley Cyrus parody, you know. 
[00:47:00]  But, you know, the every radio station had a parody guy for 25 years.  So no one has ever even moved in, to my opinion, the number two spot.  You know what I mean?  Like there's never like, you can't think of another type of thing where, okay, maybe Saturday Night Live has even had people who've copied it and come up to kind of being in the distant second.  Yeah.  I can't think of another guy that you can say he's like number two.  Even like on Owen, we play Scott and Todd stuff all the time. 
[00:47:30]  Todd Pengale is still doing a parody song, three parody songs a week, and he's not coming close.  Right.  What do you, well, that's tough to do though.  I mean, you know, if you're on a timetable and you need to like crank out three parodies a week, they can't all be gold, you know.  Well, why do you think that like guys doing morning radio who are trying to do parodies can't get this weird owl thing that makes you, you know, fantastic at parody songs?  I don't, I have some kind of chemical imbalance in my brain.  I don't know what it is.  The synapses fire a different way than most people. 
[00:48:00]  I can't explain it really.  He's also extremely good at staying in touch with his fans, knowing what they want.  I mean, the stuff that you do on Twitter.  He's a nonstop worker.  Everything that Weird Al does is, seems to be work related and it's built upon themselves.  And you never hear like, oh, during like 93 to 97, his head got big and he went on a weird thing.  He just hasn't fucked up all these years.  Well, I mean, even now as established as you are, you're still coming into Sirius XM and doing every show.  Every single show in the building. 
[00:48:30]  Which is the way to do it.  I was up until five o'clock this morning just reading Twitter comments because I just want to know what the fans think.  I want to get their feedback and it's very positive, thankfully.  But, you know, it's just really, it's cool to be like that, you know, in touch and like really see what, you know, the fans are into.  Well, that's changed so much over the years for you, too, right?  I mean, I guess you started when people would send you letters.  Right.  Remember that.  Remember the postal service.  It's also amazing because you may be the only celebrity who actually reads and writes their own Twitter.  I don't have the entourage doing it now. 
[00:49:00]  Most people are faking.  I don't know that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Britney Spears even has half her tweets are signed from the manager, from Britney, as if it's not all just some person who's hired to write Twitter.  She doesn't do well.  Well, listen, we got to get, this is a short show.  Oh, okay.  So we have to let Ron and Fez come on next, we have to go to break now, and you have 150,000 things to do here anyway.  I guess so.  So we don't want to keep you from everyone else.  Well, thank you.  It's good seeing you again, man.  You too.  Let's keep in touch. 
[00:49:30]  All right, we'll do that.  And the new album is out now.  Alpocalypse.  Alpocalypse.  The apocalypse is here.  And the Lady Gaga song is legit now.  It is.  So we can all enjoy it.  Thank you, Weird Al.  Thank you.  Ron Bennington, this has been After Opie and Anthony Live.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.
