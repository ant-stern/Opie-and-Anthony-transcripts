<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a bizarre, self-proclaimed “awful” and “disgusting” song dedicated to the New York Yankees, featuring repetitive use of "How you doin'?" and references to Yankees history and rivals.  A call from someone claiming to be Nate Giuliani requested the song.  This transitioned into a discussion of the Yankees' playoff performance against the Seattle Mariners, referencing Opie’s infamous sports curse. A caller expressed embarrassment at the song and the hosts' antics, which they admitted were intentionally annoying. The conversation included an anecdote about Mayor Giuliani and his son at a Yankee game.  The segment continued with heated debate about World Series predictions, with Opie favoring the Arizona Diamondbacks despite being a Mets fan.

Next, the show moved to a discussion of the celebrity edition of “Weakest Link,” featuring Todd Bridges, Darva Conger, Leif Garrett, and Tonya Harding (whose pornography was mentioned).  The hosts and callers used highly offensive and derogatory language to discuss the contestants’ performances and personalities.

The broadcast then shifted to a critique of a VH1 benefit concert, focusing on the negative reception Hillary Clinton received, playing audio of the booing. The hosts and callers expressed strong negative opinions towards Clinton, Susan Sarandon, and Richard Gere, criticizing their perceived disconnect from reality and hypocrisy.  Organizational issues with the concert were also discussed.

The show then heavily promoted a “Boobalander” contest, offering $1000 and later, U2 tickets, for women with breast implants willing to participate in a flashlight-based photo contest. The lack of initial participants prompted the addition of the U2 tickets.  Discussion of the “Weakest Link” episode continued.

A substantial portion focused on the poorly attended “Booble Lantern Contest.”  This segment featured a lengthy phone call with “Stalker Patty,” whom the hosts pressured into shaving her head for U2 tickets and housing money, eventually agreeing on a crew cut with bangs and a wig.  The conversation was filled with vulgar banter about Patty’s appearance and lifestyle.

Rick, a show employee, recounted his accidental visit to a gay bar, leading to further homophobic commentary from the hosts and callers.  A discussion of Rick’s perceived attractiveness to gay men ensued.  Congressman Gary Ackerman called in, describing working from a Capitol parking lot due to anthrax threats post-9/11.  The hosts discussed the anthrax scare and the post-9/11 climate.  Ackerman's call also touched on the Afghanistan campaign, Cynthia McKinney's letter to a Saudi prince, and the booing of Hillary Clinton at the benefit concert, defending Clinton and attributing the negative reaction to her political stances.  Other callers, including NYPD officers, shared their negative opinions of Clinton.  Patty's wig arrived, and further discussion of the "Booble Lantern Contest's" failure continued.

A later segment featured the on-air shaving of “Stalker Patty’s” head, first into a mohawk, then almost completely bald.  Ron and Fez from the Ron and Fez show were in studio.  The hosts and guests made numerous pop culture references (including *That Girl*, hospice patients, Vanessa Redgrave, Scott Muni, *Penny Ball Chick*, *K-Pax*, Jodie Foster, *I Dream of Jeannie*, *Coming to America*, *Star Trek II*, Jackie Kennedy, *Communion*, *Stripes*, and *Return of the Jedi*),  using vulgar and offensive language and jokes throughout the process and afterward.  The haircut was described using various comparisons (flounder, Harry Krishna, skinhead, Vulcan).  They joked about Patty's future dating prospects and the "boobal lantern" effect.  The show also promoted upcoming events, including the Grave Rave in Boston, and mentioned that photos of Patty's new look would be posted online.  Bill Stanton, author of an “anti-terror checklist,” was a guest, discussing his book in the post-9/11 context.

How awful!  I just felt like annoying a lot of people today with that little ditty.  It worked!  Well, you get past the song and all, and you know, you get down to the spirit of the whole  thing.  Alright!  Look at that, huh?  Well, congrats!  Going out to the Yankees! 
[00:04:00]  Having a bit of a little problem Saturday, but they regrouped, came right back.  And almost made Lou Piniella's head explode.  Here's something for Lou Piniella and the Seattle Mariners.  You get nothing!  You lose!  Good day, sir!  Good day, sir!  There will be, uh, uh, uh, uh, we will come back to Seattle.  Uh, there will be, uh, game six.  Shut up!  A couple phone numbers for you in the New York area, 877-692-1027. 
[00:04:30]  Anywhere else, including...  Buffalo!  How you doin'?  How you doin'?  Interesting little spike in the ratings in...  Buffalo!  Buffalo!  How you doin'?  Thank you, Buffalo.  Yes.  We'll have to get the program director on to explain what he was trying to explain to  me on the phone a little earlier.  Oh, we're trying?  What happened?  Ah, these program directors, they get the, uh, the ratings and then they decipher it 
[00:05:00]  and it gets awfully confusing.  Take it apart?  He'll explain it in terms we can understand in a little while, okay?  How you doin'?  But, uh, yeah, anywhere else but New York, please give us a call.  866-2774.  Wow, the phones are lit.  Let's go right to them.  Mike, what's goin' on?  Yeah, you guys would kill me with that song, man.  Dude, I'm workin' here, I've got dude's shield like you would not believe.  Isn't that awful?  And you're syndicated now?  I'm embarrassed for the entire city.  You know, we should explain to the other cities, we do things just to annoy you. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  Oh, God.  If you're not annoyed by this radio program, then you really shouldn't listen to us, because  there will be a time you'll be annoyed, and then you'll go, alright, that's my voice.  It's not just other cities.  I've got dude's shield, you're killing me.  It's not just other cities, we do that to New York also.  We just try to annoy, because that song, what do you think, everyone in New York loves  the How You Doing song?  Oh my God.  It's ridiculous, it's hated.  Hated.  Oh, it's embarrassing.  That song is everywhere, we're friends with those guys, but, I mean, quite frankly, 
[00:06:00]  the song blows.  Yo, but fellas, people in the city do like that song, that's the saddest.  Nah, nah.  I'm convinced.  You love the Yankees, hate the song.  It just cracks me up to hear, how you doin'?  How you doin'?  How you doin'?  How you doin'?  With these two friggin' off the boat Italian, hey!  Kaminoosh!  I like that.  Oh, it's horrible.  It's horrible.  I like the serious how you doin' at the end.  Yeah.  How you doin'?  Makes you wanna put on Drakkar and dance.  Make it Giuliani called. 
[00:06:30]  Drakkar, right?  Put on some Fahrenheit.  Yes!  Fahrenheit.  High karate.  High karate.  All right, bro.  Make it Giuliani called, and he wants us to...  Yeah.  Giuliani's everything.  Hi, Joey Balls and Karminoosh.  Yeah, I'm glad I got you on the phone through your busy schedule.  I've been trying to call for hours.  No, I have nothing to do.  Look, could you write a really annoying song for the Yankees?  Because that'd be great.  I've been trying to call you.  And put in the song that I called you up and asked you to do this, okay? 
[00:07:00]  Not enough of an abomination.  They gotta drag him into it.  Mayor Giuliani called.  Did you see Giuliani at the game last night?  Oh, yeah.  Behind home plate or more or less?  Where was he, like down the baseline a little bit?  Yeah, he was by the on-deck circle.  He didn't have to be directly behind home plate like Donald Trump and...  Eating.  And Regis.  Yeah.  He didn't have to be in the spotlight that badly.  It was pretty funny, though.  They gave him a little hookup with the New York piece and a mic.  And they did an interview with Mayor Giuliani in the middle of the game. 
[00:07:30]  Asking him about the city's pride and the Yankees and how long he's been a fan and blah, blah, blah.  All of a sudden, his son is sitting next to him.  And at some point, I guess his son didn't like something that was happening.  He just goes to sit down.  And his face is in the frame.  And he goes, ah, bull ass.  He says the bull...  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  We have it.  Oh, do you?  Well, it's gotta be beeped anyway.  Is it beeped?  Yeah. 
[00:08:00]  Go ahead.  Your childhood Yankees, Mr. Mayor.  Very similar.  Very complete teams.  You know, nope, nope.  Great pitching.  Great defense.  Yeah, you can barely hear it.  Yeah, it was obvious, though, if you were watching last night.  Like, oops.  Oops.  Mayor Giuliani can't do anything because...  Kid's looking like Chris Farley every day.  Isn't he?  Isn't he?  Nah, yeah.  He's actually getting rid of that baby fat.  Giuliani can't do anything, though.  He couldn't have turned around and said anything.  He's gotta take him to these games.  Because with the divorce going on, people forget with the gravity of the situation that's 
[00:08:30]  happened over the past, over a month here in New York, that before September 11th, every  day Giuliani was in the news also, but it was about his divorce and his girl he's got  on the side, and he just wants to be very nice to his kid.  You know, if you're a kid of divorce, you understand the parents will sometimes favor  you so you can get away with saying bull ass on a national broadcast without your pop  doing a damn thing, because he doesn't want, you know, you're going back to mom and saying 
[00:09:00]  what an a-hole dad is.  That rocked last night.  Oh, yeah.  Can I welcome Seattle to Opie's sports curse?  Yeah.  It took an extra week for that city to be hurt.  Yeah, yeah.  They, boy, they gave the Yankees a spanking there on Saturday, but that was it.  Yeah.  I mean, that was it.  And Opie had said some really nice things about the record-breaking Seattle team with  all their wins this season, and said they did a great job despite having a few injuries 
[00:09:30]  that were very key, and I guess that was enough.  That was enough.  Michael, what's going on?  Yeah, Opie?  Yeah.  Do me a favor.  Yeah.  Shut up.  Okay?  I called, and I was the white guy who called and talked about it with Oakland and the  Holson area, okay?  Just do me a favor, Opie.  Keep your mouth shut.  Don't say a word.  Well...  Just let them play. 
[00:10:00]  Let them do whatever.  Don't cheer this or cheer that, please.  I'm a Met fan.  I couldn't see it happening.  All right, Michael.  Thank you very much.  I'm just kinda...  I'm scared.  I gotta tell you something, Opie.  Right now, I'm scared.  I'm scared.  But on the other hand, I kinda wanna know...  Not a pick.  I don't wanna pick or anything from you.  I have to...  I have to make a pick.  I just want...  It's the World Series, Anthony.  No, no, no.  See, I don't want that.  I just want...  My Seattle prediction...  Some vague advice.  No, my Seattle prediction was a little too vague. 
[00:10:30]  It was pretty vague.  No, it doesn't matter.  It's like the anthrax.  It just takes one little spore in the right place.  I gave you a John Edwards-type prediction with the Seattle Yankees series.  Good enough.  I need to make a prediction for the World Series.  No.  No.  I need to do it.  No, please.  I need to do it.  What usually wins World Series?  Obviously, yeah, like Norton was gonna say, some good pitching.  Good pitching.  That's all you need to say.  Diamondbacks, baby! 
[00:11:00]  Oh, no!  Yes!  Diamondbacks!  All the way!  Oh, my God!  All the way!  Wow!  So, between Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling, they are unstoppable this year, my friend.  They're calling Schilling unhittable.  He's unhittable.  Unhittable this season.  And, of course, the big unit, you know what he's all about.  Now, are you saying that this could be a key to them emerging victorious?  Everyone knows in the end, pitching wins World Series.  Oh, my God. 
[00:11:30]  Okay, people.  Find your bookies.  Diamondbacks.  Find them immediately.  You're missing something.  Have the superior pitching staff.  I was crapping all night just thinking about, oh, my God, what if he goes, you know,  I don't like the, because I know you're not a Yankee fan, you're a Mets fan, but what  if I'm like, oh, he doesn't like them, but he does think that they'll win this.  So you're saying the pitching that the Diamondbacks have, the pitching will be the difference in  the World Series.  Okay.  Okay?  Two wins for Randy Johnson, two wins for Curt Schilling. 
[00:12:00]  You do the math, my friend.  Wow.  I'll tell you why it didn't even matter.  Because, like I said, with the Oakland Athletics Series, all Yankee predictions are  off, because as far as he's concerned in the sports curse, they're not playing anymore.  And people forget, Randy Johnson is from Seattle.  Curt Schilling is from Philadelphia.  This show is syndicated in both of those cities, and it will somehow, you have to hurt  them again.  Off the, I think this is off the instant feedback.  It's Michael.  Michael writes, after Opie did his impression of Randy Johnson choking in the postseason, 
[00:12:30]  remember I did that on the air?  Yes.  Randy Johnson going, the big unit shut down the Braves twice to send the Diamondbacks into  the World Series.  Now, some people are saying, why don't you come out and just admit you're an effing Yankee  fan.  Pitching, Messina, Pettit, Clemens, Rivera, you D-head.  Go swallow a cup of AIDS.  Wow.  Nice.  Now, I would think people probably think this.  What? 
[00:13:00]  I don't know you long enough to know that you are not a Yankee fan.  And even though the Yankees do have some great pitches, I don't think you think.  One thing you'll learn about me, Ant, I don't jump on the bandwagon ever.  Right.  Ever.  Look at my teams.  I've been an Islander fan forever.  I was an Islander fan before they started winning Stanley Cups, okay?  That's sad, yeah.  I'm a Jet fan.  I'm a Knicks fan.  I'm a Mets fan.  Enough said.  Stop playing that hideous Yankees song.  I'd rather hear It's Raining Men. 
[00:13:30]  Dave Schwartz from Philly.  Didn't like the, uh, how you doing?  It's raining men.  Whenever a guy would rather hear that over something else.  Don't tempt us.  We'll play it again right now.  It's raining men.  Brian, what's going on?  Opie, you had to do it.  Why?  Why?  Mets fan.  Love the Mets.  But you gotta go and pick the Diamondbacks.  That's it.  You give the Yankees a World Series.  That's the ring.  Thank you very much.  Have a good day.  At least I save face with all my fellow Mets fans to go on the radio and say the Yanks 
[00:14:00]  are gonna do it.  Forget it.  Can't do it.  Sean, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  Alright.  Listen, you gotta stop playing that song.  That thing's killing me.  The other night I was leaving the game.  I was in a fairly good mood.  And this bitch in front of me, one of those guidette, Gina-looking, Bensonhurst, Brooklyn  broads, with the big hair to her head clucking like a rooster.  She said, how you doing, Yankees?  How you doing?  If I would have had something to throw at her, if I were one step closer, I would have  punched her in the back of the friggin' head.  And everyone sings that song at the stadium.  I got a lot of abuse last year because of who let the dogs out of check. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  Come on.  The how you're doing is just as bad.  Ten times worse.  Ten times worse.  You guys are great.  Thank you.  Take it easy.  Bye.  All sports songs stink.  This is true.  Kenny, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Call the sales department.  Get syndicated in Arizona right now.  Why?  Because we need the curse out there.  Oh.  We need them cursed.  They're done. 
[00:15:00]  Alright.  Thank you, Kenny.  Bye.  Al Mack in Jersey, five grand on the Yanks in four.  Thank you, Opie.  In four.  Pfft.  Nick, what's going on?  Hey.  What's up?  Hold on.  Are you saying that?  Hold on.  Hold on.  You're saying that even if the Yanks pull some miracle thing and do come away and win  the series, but you're not saying that at all.  You obviously think the Dimebacks are going to do it.  There's no way they could do it in four.  How could you honestly think the Yankees are going to sweep? 
[00:15:30]  Oh, my God.  This is great.  Wait a minute.  You don't think there's a way that even if the Yankees win that it could be a sweep?  Between Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling.  Right.  Impossible.  Impossible.  We got an impossible, Rick.  Goddamn, we got an impossible.  It's impossible.  Holy Jesus, I love this.  How you doing?  I have faith in Randy and Curt, man.  All right.  That is going to be the difference, my friend.  Well, they're saying if it does go to seven games between the two of them, they could be 
[00:16:00]  pitching five of the game.  Yeah.  So, Opie, with your prediction here, Yankees in the floor.  Yankees in the floor.  Kevin Brown was a Yankee killer, too, for years.  Then when he was at the Padres, the Yankees smashed his stupid head in the World Series.  Hey, Nick, what's going on?  Heyo, speaking of differences, what's the difference between a Yankee hot dog and a Met hot dog?  What's that?  They don't sell Met hot dogs in October.  Oh. 
[00:16:30]  Nice.  Oh, that'll leave a bruise.  Eh, eh.  How you doing?  Mike, you're next to the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  Can I say three quick things, please?  What?  Can I say three quick things?  Yeah, go ahead.  Number one, you guys are the absolute best.  All right.  The second thing is, when the Yankees lose, it's only because they do it on purpose just 
[00:17:00]  so people won't get bored with them.  They're great.  You know, that's the only reason they lose.  I hate the cockiness of the Yankee fan.  You guys are disgusting.  And number three?  Yeah.  November 28th.  Twisted effing sister, baby.  Woo!  Twisted sister.  Twisted sister.  Twisted sister.  Twisted sister.  New York Steel.  Twisted sister.  Eddie Trunks.  Eddie Trunks benefit.  Oh, good.  Oh, good. 
[00:17:30]  You know what?  I'll be there, man.  I'll be there.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, buddy.  Nothing against our good friend and colleague here at NEW against Eddie Trunk.  Nothing against Eddie Trunk and this benefit.  Any benefit's great.  But have you noticed the caliber of the benefits?  Now they're all starting to come.  Everyone's getting like a benefit.  Even though the big ones are going on.  We just had the one at Madison Square Garden in DC. 
[00:18:00]  But all the other ones are starting to come out like things that might not have been either  appropriate for some reason or I don't know, not cool to do.  Now they're all doing benefits.  Twisted sister.  I wonder what he's going to do after the benefit.  Maybe go home and watch the last mash.  A strip club's doing a benefit.  Exactly.  And we're having some of the girls come in tomorrow to talk about it.  That's exactly what I'm talking about. 
[00:18:30]  When the strip clubs start getting in on the benefits.  You know, have you been checking out Bill?  Where the strip is now.  Ooh, what happened?  What's this benefit for?  What happened?  Twin Towers, she dances here on Wednesdays.  You dopey twat.  Have you been watching Bill O'Reilly lately?  Ah, I love the Bill O'Reilly.  He's definitely getting into it.  He wants to know where all this money's going. 
[00:19:00]  He's been talking to a lot of victims' families from the World Trade Center disaster.  And they're not getting it.  No one's getting paid yet.  No one's getting money.  No one.  You will probably see some of the hugest corruption ever for a cause that's ever happened.  Because there is so much money coming in from so many different places.  Why is it taking so long?  Well, you know what?  I think there's a lot of red tape going on.  They've got to figure out who they're going to give it to.  And, you know, you can't just get a bunch of money and then start doling out thousands to individuals. 
[00:19:30]  I think it's got to go to like sub-categories and then they dole it out.  But you will see a lot of this crap disappearing.  Did you hear over the weekend a couple of the Guardian Angels there?  Curtis Sliwa's crack crew, the Guardian Angels, accused of stealing some materials from down at Ground Zero.  Yo, B, can you leave your hands off the stuff for the people that need it?  Why are the Guardian Angels down there anyway?  They're guarding. 
[00:20:00]  Against what?  A Kajagoogoo comeback?  Maybe they were hip when Dinkins was in office doing nothing.  But maybe, you know, I want to make sure nothing bad goes on in the subways, Anthony.  Maybe crime has been, yeah.  You know, the Guardian Angels, it was a cute idea when the subways were riddled with crime when Dinkins was in office.  But I think since Giuliani got in and crime has been taken care of, I don't think a couple of homeboys in raspberry berets are going to be helping out the cause, to tell you that God's honest. 
[00:20:30]  You know what I mean?  It was kind of a thing of the past.  But Pinky Tuscadero has joined the Guardian Angels, Ant.  Pinky Tuscadero.  It's their new marketing scheme.  Pinky Tuscadero.  Who?  From Happy Days.  Happy Days, yeah.  Pinky Tuscadero.  She was Leather's sister.  Curtis still goes around with that God-effing beret on his head.  Can you even believe it? 
[00:21:00]  He got shot though.  I like Curtis, man.  He got shot five times in a cab.  And survived.  Yeah.  For Reagan.  You got to give him props for that, man.  Hey, dude.  Hey.  I'll give the props to anybody who goes.  Yeah.  One.  Two.  One.  Woo!  Hello, this is your leader, Curtis Lewa.  I need a division down at the subway.  Curtis, there's not really much crime down there.  There's a lot of great police presence. 
[00:21:30]  It's not really that bad anymore.  They're embarrassing the beret.  His raspberry beret.  Where's Lisa?  You know what Lisa's saying?  You got his wife in there and everything.  You know, in the old days, I think it made people feel good that they were on the train  and stuff, but now they're pilfering materials from Ground Zero.  They stole, like, boots and stuff and shirts.  She's the red, very good day. 
[00:22:00]  The kind of mine in a second.  Right.  Woo!  Awful.  Dinkins.  Oh, what a time that was.  David Dinkins.  What a leader.  Wearing pants with the butt cut out, never funny.  No.  Maybe that was good in the 80s.  I hate that song.  Put out, never funny.  No.  Maybe that was good in the 80s. 
[00:22:30]  I hate that song.  Prance around with his freaking ass hanging out.  You see what's going on here now?  Never funny and never entertaining.  Stop it.  Right?  Oh, Prince.  That's what I was talking about.  Right.  Oh, okay.  I got you.  All right.  We have to take our first break.  Hey, the boobalander contest is on.  Girls just lining up outside the studio. 
[00:23:00]  Sure they are.  Like they always do for our internet contest.  Look, we need girls with breast implants.  It's plain and simple as that.  Today we are doing the boobalander contest.  You come down.  You got your implants.  We shine flashlights through them.  They light up like jack-o'-lanterns.  Not really.  It's amazing.  We're going to snap some pictures. 
[00:23:30]  And a before and after shot.  Before and after.  So you get to see the loveliness of the lady.  And then we'll put her in a dark room with the flashlights.  And we'll take a picture of her.  Her boobs completely lit up.  Mm-hmm.  We have a thousand dollar gash prize.  Hey.  I mean cash.  Cash prize.  Thousand dollar cash prize.  There you go, you implanted vixens.  It's a grand.  A thousand bucks.  Who will be the first lady to show up for the boobalander contest?  I know there are strippers that go to bachelor parties alone that would be happy to come down and not have to choke in order to make a thousand dollars like they do at the bachelor parties. 
[00:24:00]  Gag reflexes won't be involved here like it is at the bachelor parties.  And you probably only make 500 bucks.  Right.  We need the ladies with the breast implants to show up immediately.  Yeah.  We don't care what your line of work is or nothing.  Just come down here with your implants.  Between now and Friday, between the hours of 3 and 7, all you have to do is show up.  You don't have to call us and tell us you're showing up.  Just show up with your boobs and your breast implants.  Okay? 
[00:24:30]  And we're also doing this contest in Boston when we broadcast from WBCN Studios on Monday and Tuesday next week.  Mm-hmm.  So ladies in the Boston area.  You too.  Yeah.  Make sure you show up at the station Monday or Tuesday when we're up there between the hours of 3 and 7 with your implants.  We'll take your pictures up there as well.  Okay?  $1,000 cash prize.  This is a two-city contest.  I love it.  Yes.  Okay.  And you won't need your gag reflexes because we're all packing under five. 
[00:25:00]  Speak for yourself, my friend.  All right.  The phones are just lit.  We have to talk about the weakest link.  The weakest link.  That was brutal.  Also, there was some kind of benefit on VH1 or whatever?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  We'll talk about that and other things, of course.  You know the deal.  We'll be back.  Don't be an a-hole.  You seem a little drunk, Anthony.  Go after yourself, Anthony.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:25:30]  The girl's just lining up outside the studio for the Boobalander contest.  Oh, yeah.  Wow, look at them.  All the way down the hall, Anthony.  All over.  It's amazing.  Where are we going to put them all?  We stink.  Not one lady has shown up to the Boobalander contest.  We've been promoting this for, God, at least two days.  Yeah, right?  It's a $1,000 cash prize, by the way.  $1,000 cash for first place. 
[00:26:00]  That's right, Anthony.  If you have breast implants, we're looking for you to come down.  We put flashlights under your breasts, and they light up like jack-o-lanterns.  That's why we call them Boobalander.  All we need is to take a before shot of your loveliness and an after shot of just your boobs lit up.  We'll put the pictures up on the website so you'll become a star of the show, I'm telling you.  You'll be recognized everywhere.  And then the listeners will vote for their favorite, and you'll walk away with $1,000.  All right?  Right.  I guess they need a little incentive for coming down here. 
[00:26:30]  All right.  Are we going to give them some besides $1,000 cash prize?  One lady will definitely walk away with $1,000, okay?  We're allowing you to come down today, tomorrow, Thursday, or Friday between the hours of 3 and 7.  You just show up, just like all the other contests we do.  And then we're going to do the contest up in Boston where we broadcast live from WBCN on Monday and Tuesday for the Grave Rave.  By the way, we have tickets for that to give away.  But here's the deal.  Ladies, if you come down here today or tomorrow, today or tomorrow, we're going to put your name in a drawing for U2 tickets. 
[00:27:00]  Ah, a little more incentive.  We got good U2 tickets for tomorrow night's show, right?  So, ladies, you're crazy if you don't come down now.  Not only do you have a chance to win the $1,000, but if you show up today or tomorrow, you'll be in the drawing for the U2 tickets for the show tomorrow night at the Garden.  And we know if you got implants that you got them because you want people to look at them.  Right.  So stop it with the shyness.  Do you mean that theoretically somebody could win tickets to U2 and $1,000? 
[00:27:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it could happen.  Oh, yeah.  The U2 thing is just for the next two days just to get this contest rolling.  Started.  So once again, ladies, you show up for the Booba Lantern contest today or tomorrow.  Your name will be in the drawing for the U2 tickets.  Right.  At the Garden tomorrow night.  Okay?  There you go.  Now, if the ladies don't show up, we're just completely pathetic.  Oh, yeah.  Also, if Stalker Patty's listening, give us a call because we know you love U2 so much.  Stan from Hoboken saying, don't worry, guys.  It's too early for strippers.  They're like comics.  They don't wake up until 6 p.m. 
[00:28:00]  That is true.  Good point.  Might get a late rush then today.  All right.  Cliff, what's going on?  Hey, I don't know.  The only thing better than the Yankee game last night, guys, did you guys see Todd Bridges  rip Darva Conger a new A last night on the weakest link?  The weakest link last night was so pathetic.  It was really sad to watch.  They had a bunch of people that had their 15 minutes of fame.  They were called newsmakers.  Newsmakers.  No, I don't consider that newsmakers. 
[00:28:30]  I think it was like the has-been corner.  It was so sad that I almost fell off my couch laughing.  They had...  Go ahead.  Todd Bridges just ripped into Darva, and Darva ripped her back, and I thought they were just  going to throw it down right there in the studio.  Darva had nothing to say to Todd Bridges.  She had a little bit, but Todd just ripped her a new one.  Well, Darva said something about Todd on drugs, and then Todd said something back to Darva.  You must have been on drugs when you had to go on Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire?  Right.  But just the whole thing, and then that fag, Kato Kaelin. 
[00:29:00]  I don't know if you saw the whole thing, but...  Kato Kaelin was so excited to be there.  He was taking it so seriously.  Yeah.  He was so into it.  Leif Garrett, man.  He was the best.  It's Leif.  It's Leif.  Still the best behind the music ever.  Yeah.  And he could care less.  He didn't even shower for his appearance on Weakest Link.  He was just a mess, and he didn't care.  One of the best things, they asked him how many sides were there on a stop sign, and 
[00:29:30]  he said six.  He didn't know, and then it's like, hey, wait, didn't he blow through one and paralyze  his friend?  Jeez, and they asked him how many sides on a stop sign.  I don't know.  I never pay attention to them.  You know, I would have been a dick, and I would have just said two.  The front and the back.  Oh, there you go.  I wonder if they would have accepted that.  That's two sides, technically, right?  What other tools did they have on there?  Of course, Darma Conger.  Jennifer Flowers.  Kato Kalin. 
[00:30:00]  Todd Bridges.  Puck.  Puck.  From the real world.  Puck was completely disappointing.  Well, has he ever been not disappointing?  I like when he's just an obnoxious a-hole.  He was trying to be.  He's like, introduced himself.  Hey, I'm Puck from my mother's womb, because they all had to say their name and where they're  from.  Yeah, he had nothing.  Nah, nah.  Awful.  He had nothing.  And he's wearing his sunglasses.  Right.  I mean, you know, Puck, you're inside somewhere.  You're in a building.  I think if you wear his sunglasses inside a building, it just says to me, effing tool. 
[00:30:30]  Effing tool.  So he was there wearing his sunglasses.  Seems like his hair grew out.  And his charity, they're all playing for charity, which I don't understand.  It's not like those people have money.  Those guys need the money.  They should play for themselves.  They had Kaya from Temptation Island.  Kaya from Temptation Island.  What, did they ran out of has-beens or something?  I know.  What the hell is that all about?  Like, he was just recently a has-been.  They couldn't find one more person?  Oh, Tonya Harding was part of that, too, right? 
[00:31:00]  She was...  Oh, Tonya Harding.  She was dumped early.  Yeah, she quite possibly the stupidest individual on the face of this great earth.  I don't know.  Darvin Conner was pretty stupid.  She got one or two things right.  One or two answers.  Uh, Kaya was pretty stupid.  How many Mondays could there be in the month of, uh, what was it?  Uh, he said one.  August or whatever, and he said one?  You know what, though?  He did well throughout the whole thing.  He had some rounds where he didn't do very well, but other ones where he answered every question. 
[00:31:30]  Uh, Tonya Harding did not get one question right.  Not one.  Joe?  Yeah, how you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  I'm doing good.  You've, you...  I don't know if you guys mentioned Tonya freaking Harding.  Yeah.  She got kicked off early.  You see how she looked?  She looked like a friggin' sleaze bucket.  Well...  She's always been a sleaze bucket.  They just prettied her up after that Nancy Kurgan crap.  They gussied her up for a skating thing.  She was always a skank.  I think she looked the best in her porno. 
[00:32:00]  Huh, Joe?  They should have asked her, how many hits with a lead pipe does it take to break?  Take a kneecap.  Yeah, they all got, like, little related questions to what they do.  I think, um...  What's her name?  Jennifer Flowers?  How about how many hits to the face will, uh, you know, return your face back to normal?  Oh.  Yeah, well, this happens.  All right, Joe.  All right.  All right, I'll talk to you.  All right.  Jennifer Flowers got asked a question about Monica Lewinsky, which everyone was like,  huddle, huddle.  Look, look.  One White House whore being asked a question about another. 
[00:32:30]  Isn't that something?  I like Tonya Harding's porno, though, because Jeff Galooly was packing.  Jeff Galooly had some, and she accepted it all.  What a trooper.  But what lousy upper half that girl had.  Upper?  What about the bottom half?  Nice.  It didn't matter.  The famous line, it looked like she sat in a gravel driveway.  A gravel driveway.  You know what, though?  You're a little...  You give it a little leeway when it is just squatting on a Jeff Galooly.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  In that context, it was okay to watch her just going up and down. 
[00:33:00]  But the top half was like...  It looked like when you hop on a...  A hoppity hop.  A hoppity hop.  And the...  Boing, boing.  And the big balloon is her ass.  Yeah, the round ball turns like oblong.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  What's up, Brick?  Hey, what's going on, man?  Hey.  Hey, first of all, you guys are blowing up in Rochester.  Well, we're on a little late, but cool.  All right.  Did you hear that stupid question about...  I got asked to Cato about the larva, about the caterpillar. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, he said about Bethlehem, something like offspring or something.  Yeah.  They should have named that freaking show The Dumbest Link, man.  Those people...  What's that?  The questions were so easy to begin with.  Oh, yeah, for sure, dude.  They really made them really easy for this version of Weakest Link.  Oh, yeah, for sure.  Like, everybody altogether, dude, would not even equal 15 minutes.  You know what I mean?  Right.  All right, man.  You guys suck.  All right, man.  Thank you.  They couldn't get anything right.  It was hysterical.  They all like...  And they couldn't get any money.  Like, Kai would do okay, and then the next one down would be stupid friggin', what's 
[00:34:00]  her name there, Tanya Harding, that she couldn't get it right.  First round out of 120 grand, they got $1,000.  They got $1,000, and that was because someone got it in at the end.  Yeah.  And can I state for the record, I don't like this bad-mouthing of Puck.  Puck, his charity, it was children with AIDS.  That was his charity.  Now, here's a guy who, if you remember him on the real world, San Francisco.  San Francisco.  His housemate, your housemate, Puck, was the Cuban from Miami named Pedro. 
[00:34:30]  I am HIV positive.  I have the A's.  And I don't like that Puck is living in this house because it's not a good environment for  me with HIV.  He called it HIV.  HIV.  HIV.  Don't forget the finger in the peanut butter.  Puck, I saw you pick your scars on your arms, and then you push your fingers in the peanut 
[00:35:00]  butter.  You push your fingers in the peanut butter.  Your fingers.  I cannot leave, this is not, look, this is not an healthy environment for me with HIV.  And then, now I'm in a relationship, I'm getting married, it's cute, we're in love, it's cute.  And Lucy got Little Ricky to Mrs. Trumbull, because Puck picked his scars and picked up Little 
[00:35:30]  Ricky's baby bottle.  Babalu, Babalu, aye, California, here I come.  Right back where I started from.  And then he picks the charity.  He used to, he said at one point, he alluded to the fact that Pedro was using his AIDS to  get sympathy on the show.  It's like, wait a minute, the guy's got AIDS. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, he was using it to educate.  Ooh, because at one point he was like saying stuff like, ooh, I got AIDS.  Ooh.  Right.  Like, wow.  I want A.  Hey, what's up, Sonny?  Hey, guys, what's going on?  Hey.  Yeah, I got a couple things about the week.  I think the first thing I'd like to say, I got the Boogeyman DVD and it's excellent.  Thank you, guys.  Oh, cool.  And also, Leif Garen, I mean, that show is embarrassing, but you know what's funny?  It's Leif, Sonny.  The Tony Siragusa Fund.  What was his charity?  His charity was the Tony Siragusa Fund. 
[00:36:30]  I was watching it.  Well, that might be a good fund, though.  No, you know what it is?  I know exactly what it is.  Not to fear this fat face.  When he was a kid, Siragusa, he was adopted, but there was some kind of big scandal.  It was a big court drama.  So the charity is for adopted kids or something.  And he's got a fire department shirt on, and he's playing for the Tony Siragusa Fund.  Well, you know, the adopted kids need love and time.  He's a tool.  It makes no sense, does it? 
[00:37:00]  Does it make any sense?  No.  What the hell is the Tony Siragusa Fund?  Why don't you just have the Ray Lewis Fund to kill people?  All right.  Thank you, Sonny.  Hey, guys, you suck.  Thank you, Sonny.  Somewhere, I believe.  This is what Todd Bridges had to say about Darva.  Darva's not going to get a single question right.  If he can't get Manwiches of Manwiches, then come on.  How many times has that commercial been on?  I mean, that's the dumbest person I've ever seen in my life.  You can't get that one.  Nice.  Dumbest person he's ever seen in his life, and he knew Dana Plato.  Please.  You know what?  We interviewed Darva. 
[00:37:30]  He's right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She sat there.  This was right after she did her Playboy, was it?  Yeah.  We made her cry.  Yeah, it was up to Sam Adams Brewery, and she left our interview in tears.  And ran away.  Because we were kind of just joking around, having fun with her.  Jim Cook said it was the most uncomfortable moment of his life.  This is the most uncomfortable moment in my life.  And there's been times where I fell into a vat of beer, drunk off my ass. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, Scorch was there.  A little no-  Scorch.  Hey, Scorch.  Gary Goldstein was there.  Gary Goldstein here with Darvin Conner.  Do your dressing, Darvin.  Do your dressing.  She runs away from us crying, and then Scorch ran after just harassing her some more.  Hey, do your dressing.  Hey, we need food for the doggies.  All right.  Well, that's enough about Weakest Lang.  It was...  Oh, Weakest Lang!  Matt, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  You know about the whole VH1 benefit concert this past weekend on Sunday? 
[00:38:30]  I haven't seen it.  I haven't seen it yet.  Oh, yeah.  Well, they had a whole big thing in Madison Square Garden, and Hillary Clinton came out,  and half the crowd was booing her off the stage.  Yeah.  I guess you guys don't know why, but she...  Oh, I know why.  We all know why.  Oh, okay.  Because she's a C?  Yeah, because she's a big C.  She has a C, but...  Well, she pretty much called the cops of New York murderers, so...  Well, not only that, but she was driving to the airport, like, this past weekend or something, 
[00:39:00]  and there was a security checkpoint.  Wait, can I interrupt you?  Because I got a great email about this from Milo Yambag.  Yeah?  Who's a regular contributor of our radio show.  Okay.  Guys, please tell me you have audio of that lion, thick-ankled pig, Hillary,  getting booed by us cops and the firemen at the garden.  Please, please, please give her the business today on the show.  This is the same Hillary who called us murderers,  and don't forget that fat, hypocrite, golf-ball-eyed Susan Sarandon showing up.  Well, listen, you guys are going to love this because... 
[00:39:30]  Hold on, I'm not done.  These two hate, literally despise the ordinary guys, cops, firemen, EMTs, military,  yet they show up like the whores that they really are.  Hillary only lasted 22 seconds on stage.  Let everyone know for us.  Thanks, Joe.  That's, yeah, but this past weekend, she was driving to the airport.  There was a security checkpoint.  She didn't want to stop in because, you know, she's too good and too important for all that stuff.  Well, because she's Hillary.  Yeah, and, you know, she told her driver to just floor it and fly through the cops. 
[00:40:00]  She nailed the cop, broke his arm, put him in the hospital,  and, you know, she claims she, like, loves all the cops in her.  Sorry.  Hey, dude.  You've got to watch your language.  All right.  Sorry, man.  Can I just request, though, although Milo Yambay made a very good point,  that he never writes, give anyone the business.  The business.  Right.  All right, man.  We'll give you the business.  And the funny thing is, none of the news stations covered it.  Only, like, Rush Limbaugh and a couple others did.  I thought it was hilarious. 
[00:40:30]  What?  At much limbo.  I didn't remember him, no.  All right, guys.  Yeah, Hillary is a scum.  And we had said this when she first said she was running for the Senate here in New York.  We said that she was this scum, carpet-bagging, phony.  You know, she's campaigning, and there she is at the Met Games and the Yankee Games. 
[00:41:00]  She's a big fan of New York.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  She never showed up for the Yankee Games?  I think she wore a Yankee hat.  You're right.  She showed up at a Met Games.  She couldn't really commit either way, and she wouldn't show up at any of the games.  Well, because it wasn't in her best interest to take any sides, just like it is now.  It's whatever suits Hillary Clinton at that minute.  Whatever suits Hillary Clinton at that moment is what Hillary will do.  That's it. 
[00:41:30]  She is a scum.  And it wasn't fooling anybody at the Garden when she got up there, just like I said, with Susan Sarandon and her golf ball eyes.  Isn't that great, the golf ball eyes?  That's brilliant.  Milo, brilliant.  And she gets up there, and you know something?  It was you could not find a more honest crowd than was there at Madison Square Garden with everything that's gone on.  You know, because some people wrote and said things like Hillary didn't get booed that badly. 
[00:42:00]  It was a crowd of people that had been drinking, all white firemen, right-wing people.  No, you will not find a more honest group of people than a group brought together in pain and after the situation that happened,  brought to a place to celebrate each other and remember the people they lost.  This is a real crowd.  It's not a phony political crowd. 
[00:42:30]  It's not a phony Hollywood event crowd.  This is the real people.  And she finally got a dose of what real people think about her.  They booed her and hate her because it wasn't an event that her people can go out and screen and control,  and they lost their effing minds when they found out when this happened to Hillary.  Now, she was supposed to be up there a couple minutes and do her little thing.  Right.  She barely lasted 20 seconds.  We have the audio?  Can we play that now?  Yeah.  And she did her loud mouth Hillary speaking because she was being booed. 
[00:43:00]  And I think that her Mars.  And they're just booing.  She was using her Mars attack?  Her Mars attack.  Because if you remember from her speeches, her speeches from when she was campaigning,  she would start low and be like,  the people of New York need a leader in Washington that is going to take care of the...  She does not talk like a human being. 
[00:43:30]  No, because she's not a human.  But you know what?  I dislike Hillary a lot.  But you know who I dis...  The dummies in this city that voted for her.  She didn't force her way in.  You dummies voted for her.  They bought her line of crap.  They bought her speeches in front of chosen people that are going to wave their Hillary flags and cheer her every word.  And then the second she gets into a real group of true New Yorkers, they let her know how they honestly feel about her crap. 
[00:44:00]  Her showing up at events and ground zero and with Chuck Schumer buried so far up her colon that he's got ring around the collar.  That they know she's being a phony.  Because that's what she is.  A phony.  Well, she's hailed as this feminist and this powerful woman.  And all she did was stay married to a guy who banged everyone.  Right.  There you go.  Boy, there's leadership.  You couldn't keep track of your husband's affairs.  Now she's going to take care of New York's affairs.  Thank you. 
[00:44:30]  All right, where's that audio?  We got it here.  General Wartz checking in saying,  Crumpet bagging?  Here it is.  Here it is from the other night.  Thank you.  Thank you for being here tonight.  Thank you for supporting New York.  Thank you for your generosity on behalf of all the people who are going to need help for a long time to come.  Now it's my great pleasure to introduce a video from someone who has a lot to say about New York who couldn't be here tonight. 
[00:45:00]  Please join me in welcoming Jerry Seinfeld.  Oh, and then you can hear.  Hey, Jerry.  I wish we had a little more of that because then you can hear people finally cheering.  Boo, boo, Jerry.  Oh, I love Jerry.  Yay.  Hey, they weren't yelling Lou.  No.  Lou.  Oh, man.  Did she get the business?  Remember when Lou Piniello was playing for the Yanks?  They're booing Lou. 
[00:45:30]  No, idiot.  They're Lou.  Boo.  And then she's, you know, she's not taking a pause in her speech because she knows it's just going to get ugly if she stops.  Hey, hickory, hickory, doc.  I think I better leave.  And she's like, thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  See what a phony she is?  She couldn't even address the situation and go, you know, if she had a set of balls like we all know she's got under that skirt,  that big set of sweaty.  She should have gone out, and the second they start booing, going, are you kidding me? 
[00:46:00]  Go, do you know why we're here, you idiots?  And just, like, shut them up like that a little bit.  But she just didn't acknowledge it was happening.  Thank you.  Thank you for booing me.  Ak, ak, ak.  Yeah, she started getting loud at the end there.  Ak, ak.  Yeah.  Great.  A bunch of drunk cops and firemen just booing her.  Good for them.  Love it.  Good for them.  Who wants to hear it again?  Yeah, I'd love to hear it again.  Let me hear the booing.  Let me hear the booing.  Thank you, thank you for being here tonight.  Thank you for supporting New York. 
[00:46:30]  Thank you for your generosity on behalf of all the people who are going to need help for a long time to come.  Now, it's my great pleasure to introduce a video from someone who has a lot to say about New York  and couldn't be here tonight.  Please join me in welcoming Jerry Seinfeld.  Oh, Jerry.  He was shouting.  Yeah. 
[00:47:00]  At the end, he could offer the booze.  Because her voice kind of went, ah, ah.  She probably went backstage and she's like, I just don't understand.  I did all the right things.  I went down to ground zero and I did this and I did that.  And I appeared on all the shows and I showed concern.  She doesn't understand.  Leaders are not born.  You can't just make yourself one like that.  Being a phony.  It takes like leadership grabbing the horse by the reins and getting out there and doing the job.  Giving the business to people. 
[00:47:30]  Giving the business to people.  But she got out there.  Every time you saw her at an event, it was a photo op moment.  It was just something to serve herself.  And I'm getting some emails here that say, oh, wow, a self-serving politician.  Gee, who cares?  You know, they're all self-serving.  I don't care even if you're self-serving to get elected.  As long as after you get elected, you do the job for the people.  You do the best of your ability or whatever.  She's still, to this point, she is just looking for publicity. 
[00:48:00]  You think she wants to be senator of New York?  This is some stepping stone, some pain in the ass dues she has to pay to a bigger office that she wants.  That's all.  Which would be the president.  She wants to be president.  And God help us people, if there are enough dim-witted sons of bastards in this country to vote her into the White House.  And, you know, it's not, well, politicians are,  there are some that are very brutally honest.  Like, Giuliani, whether you like him or not, does what he thinks is right.  Reagan did what he thought was right. 
[00:48:30]  Jimmy Carter, whether you like him or not.  That's true.  That's an honest guy.  Yeah, right, right.  That's what I love about Giuliani.  He doesn't care, you know, what you think of him.  If he cared what you thought, he'd have done things completely different.  There are plenty of things about Giuliani I can't effing stand.  His policy on a lot of stuff is ridiculous.  Ridiculous.  But, you know, you've got to give him the credit that he went into the job and wasn't afraid to be cursed at by people.  Wasn't afraid to get, yeah, people all pissed off.  So, I think we could all agree that why the hell after crime dropped, amazing, amazing drop in crime here in New York, 
[00:49:00]  he didn't give the cops a raise.  It's not Giuliani walking around the streets shopping crime.  I'm a super here.  It's not like I'm Wonder Woman or Super Lady.  It was the cops that did it, and him not giving him money, that burned a lot of people.  Cops still waiting for their raise, by the way.  Right.  And meanwhile, they had to get a deduction because of the situation.  Things like that, though, it's a leader.  A leader has to be somebody that isn't afraid to do something that's going to piss people off. 
[00:49:30]  As long as you know in the long run it will get better.  But Hillary, she'll wait for polls to come out.  What do the most people think about this?  Because that'll be my idea on the whole situation.  She's a twat.  Bobby, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hey, guys.  Love the show.  Listen, I'm on a job in the city, and another good moment with a famous person,  that gerbil smuggling Richard Gere, when he started ranting about that liberal,  you know, now it's time for compassion and love, and he got booed. 
[00:50:00]  He's like, oh, I guess this crowd isn't the kind of crowd I should be discussing this issue with.  Yeah.  What a tool he is.  I think we got the Richard Gere thing, too.  Thanks, Bobby.  Okay.  Richard Gere, Susan Sarandon, golf-balled-eyed Susan Sarandon, she's another one.  They all come from this world that has nothing to do with the real world that we live in.  They are from, they might as well be from another planet, because they are living the Hollywood life  in gated compounds, their every whim is taken care of. 
[00:50:30]  They know nothing about what real people go through in life, and it changes their whole outlook on things.  They look at the world like it's a movie or something.  Well, one cop wouldn't let Susan Sarandon.  She had gone down to ground zero, and she went back, and he's like, eh, eh, you're not, it was a sergeant, I think.  Good for him.  No, you're not going down there.  She's another one.  She doesn't understand her and Richard Gere with the whole, if we could turn it around peaceful.  Play the Richard Gere thing.  There it is.  And listen to what this idiot is saying to this crowd of people that really don't want to hear this. 
[00:51:00]  And I think in this situation right now, when we have the possibility of taking this energy,  this horrendous energy that we're all feeling, and the possibility of turning it into more violence and revenge,  we can stop that.  We can take that energy and turn it into something else.  We can turn it into compassion, into love, into understanding. 
[00:51:30]  That's apparently unpopular right now.  But that's all right.  You dick.  What an idiot.  You dick.  I mean, compassion and love should be felt for the families and the people that are dead because of this.  Not for the people that we are bombing.  They don't understand that we weren't doing anything.  It was very nice. 
[00:52:00]  We were living a very peaceful existence here in this country before September 11th.  We weren't doing anything and we got crapped on.  So, these people advocate us sitting there because, you know what, Richard Gere's house didn't fall down.  Susan Sarandon, golf ball by Susan Sarandon, who I will now always refer to as that, her house didn't fall down.  How are you not laughing the next time you see her on TV now?  Holy ass, they do look like golf balls.  She had a great line about Hillary's legs, too, or something about how fat her legs are and her awful ankles. 
[00:52:30]  Big, disgusting feet.  Looks like when she puts those tight shoes on right out of the top, it looks like bread is baking and rising out of the pan.  Just disgusting feet.  You know, they're all, like, they got all knobs on them and whatnot.  Ugh.  Dang it.  Hey, what's up, man?  And why, what, fire?  Yeah.  Fireman, what's up, bro?  Hey, we need a bunch of firefighters.  We were down at Gonzalo.  She came by.  Yeah.  As you leave the wall going, ah, black, black, black, black, black, black, black, black, black. 
[00:53:00]  It was funny.  Yeah, the next time you see Hillary walking around, which she rarely does.  Yeah, definitely.  She's ugly in person.  Definitely do that.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Someone should hit with a baseball bat.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  All right, Dennis.  Thank you.  Bye, bye, bye.  Stupid Affleck duck senator she is.  All right, we've got to take a break.  Oh, my God.  Hey, how are we doing with the Booble Lantern Contest?  I'm sure now with the opportunity to be put in a drawing for U2 tickets, a possibility of $1,000 to the winner here, 
[00:53:30]  I'm sure they're just lining up outside.  I am absolutely sure they're lining up outside.  How many people are here for the Booble Lantern Contest?  None.  None?  Did Richard Gere, I heard he got a little upset after they were booing?  We have another clip of Richard Gere after...  I didn't hear this.  The people were booing him because of his stupid comments.  Well, yeah, they were running tape backstage.  Why are they after he walked off?  Because he looked like he was pretty composed still when he left the stage.  This is audio of Richard as he was hugging Hillary. 
[00:54:00]  Ah, right.  And feeling a little bad.  I got nowhere else to go!  I got nowhere else to go!  I've got nothing else.  Oh, poor guy.  Well, peace, love, and gerbils to you, Mr. Gere.  I have a question.  If we can't get a Booble Lantern person, could Hillary come down and we can shine a flashlight  through her fat feet?  Her cankles?  Her cankles. 
[00:54:30]  Her bunt.  Does a lot just shine through her bunt?  Her cankles.  Calfs same width as ankles.  Cankles.  Cankles.  Big, puffy, just doughy, rising, breadfoot.  Cankles.  Kristen, what's up?  Hi.  You know, you are complaining, but you weren't here in D.C. where we had Michael Jackson coming  on at 1 a.m.  Oh, yeah?  For our...  That's when he should come on stage. 
[00:55:00]  Someone else will scare the children.  Doesn't he die if sunlight hits him?  Something like that?  Stake in the heart?  I'm glad Michael Jackson went on stage at 1 a.m. in Washington.  All the kids were safe in the Washington area.  They were all tucked in nicely in their little beds.  Well, a lot of them were at the concert, but I'm not even going to go there, but it was  just horrible.  Booble Lantern Contest, Anthony.  Here's the deal.  $1,000 first place prize.  We're doing this all this week between the hours of 3 and 7. 
[00:55:30]  Ladies with implants, you've got to come down and get photographed.  We turn off all the lights.  We put flashlights under your boobs.  They light up, and then our listeners will vote for their favorite Booble Lantern.  A little extra incentive for all the ladies that come down today and tomorrow.  Get this thing started.  You'll be put in a drawing for you two tickets for tomorrow night's show at the Garden, okay?  Great.  And we still have no one here.  All right.  Oh, yeah, and Stalker Patty, we're waiting for you to call in as well. 
[00:56:00]  Nothing you've imagined has prepared you for this.  Hey, oh, come to him.  I'm gay.  I just boxed mouth.  He said sit on it, so I did.  Opie and Anthony.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Patiently waiting for the first contestant of our Booble Lantern Contest. 
[00:56:30]  Booble Lantern, come on, ladies.  If you've got implants, there's a chance to win $1,000 cash and a chance to win U2 tickets.  I swear we don't fight.  Come on.  We are so nice in person.  A little extra incentive.  Yeah, the grand prize is $1,000 because this contest goes for the rest of this week and Monday and Tuesday of next week when we're up in Boston.  The ladies have a chance to qualify.  By the way, ladies in Philly, it's not that far.  Come on up.  The important question is if Olivia Newton-John comes in, can she only win $500? 
[00:57:00]  Oh!  But the incentive is to get this contest going.  All the ladies that enter today and tomorrow, you'll be in the drawing for U2 tickets, okay?  Right.  Help us out.  We're going to look like complete idiots if no one shows up today.  Oh, Storker Patty's on the line?  Okay.  Hello.  Hello.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  What's up?  What's up?  How are you?  How are you doing? 
[00:57:30]  Okay.  Okay.  What?  Did you find a place to live, Patty?  Well, I'm still looking around.  I'm supposed to see a place in Brooklyn tonight by Brooklyn Heights.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Cozy little hole in between a crack in the sidewalk.  I know.  Hey, Patty.  Yes?  We know how much you like U2.  Oh, I love them.  Yes. 
[00:58:00]  And the concert that I went to in June was so awesome.  And you know what she did to win tickets last time on this very program?  Oh, she had to go into Ron Jeremy's pants for them.  Yeah.  And she actually let Ron Jeremy feel her, too.  Well, yeah.  Ron Jeremy went into her bloomers.  Bloomers, I can't even say the word, because usually when you say the word panties, it's  such a hot thing.  Big, meaty, big, meaty Ron Jeremy hands, and just slapping all over that unused area. 
[00:58:30]  Bloomers.  I don't think I wear bloomers.  Dusty old reproductive system.  What do you wear, Patty?  What do you wear?  What am I wearing?  Regular ones.  What is regular ones?  No, she was wearing thongs for a while.  She was wearing the thongs for a while, remember?  I'm wearing a thing.  Well, that's after we got rid of all the ass hair.  She wanted to show it off.  I didn't have that. 
[00:59:00]  Patty, you have the sex appeal of a diabetic toe amputation.  Thank you, Jim.  That's a compliment.  Thank you.  It's not buddy here.  It's called ciliate, patexorixoskeleton.  She wanted to show off her smooth butt to all the other ladies at the rape center.  Very funny.  Awful.  Terrible, terrible.  Well, Patty, Earl came in and we have an extra pair of U2 tickets. 
[00:59:30]  We're going to give away a pair to some of the ladies that enter the Boobalander contest.  Right.  But we do have this extra pair of U2 tickets.  Yeah?  You want to go see U2?  I'd love to.  Ah, well, so what do you think?  You just got to come down here and pick them up and go to the show?  I guess there's something to it.  See, I'm smart.  Ah, well, don't slow down.  Slow down.  Slow down.  Patty?  Yes?  Yeah, we did have something in mind. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah, just a little something.  For these tickets.  Okay.  Well, um...  Well, run it by me.  Run it by me.  Have you been to an airport lately?  No, I've very rarely ever been to one in my life.  Maybe Newark and only once.  And then I was fascinated by those little moving sidewalks that move.  And you stand and you hold on and ride.  It was fun.  God, are you an asshole?  I've never been on one before, so it was fascinating. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, my God.  And that was my only experience.  I think life will be more...  I think death will be more fascinating to you than life.  Oh, no.  You find that fascinating?  She was fascinated by the moving sidewalk thing.  Yeah, it was fun.  I've never seen one before.  It's a flat escalator.  And what's the thrill?  And look, if I start walking, it looks like I'm running to the people that are just walking outside it.  And if I turn around, I'm like a mime walking into the wind.  Yeah, but it's a new experience for me. 
[01:01:00]  I don't see a near point.  Wow.  How do you feel about fire and the wheel and, ooh, those wacky inventions?  Patty.  Yeah?  You were thrilled.  This is the kind of life she leads.  She's thrilled by things like that.  Next week, she's going to conquer the escalator.  Don't wipe it on that.  I went on this thing at the department store.  It was amazing.  It's like stairs, only they move.  And you step on them.  And all of a sudden, you get off on another floor.  I went up and down all day. 
[01:01:30]  Patty, have you ever been in the magic box where you push a button and it takes you to another place in the building?  No.  What is that?  I go into this magic box.  Oh, an elevator?  Yeah, I've been on an elevator.  You press a button, the door closes, and then when it opens again, there's a whole other place in front of you.  No, but those flat sidewalk things were, like, fun.  Oh, there you go.  Fun.  And what were you at the airport for if you weren't going anywhere?  Well, it was one of our sister's stores at the time, a place I was working with 10 years ago. 
[01:02:00]  Patty, have you ever flown?  No, I've never been on a plane in my life.  Are you afraid?  No, I wouldn't be afraid.  It would be fascinating to look out the window.  Although with her slender, disgusting body, someone could probably use her as a knife.  Like a shiv.  It's like getting your hand on a nice, sharp nail in prison.  You've never flown?  No, I've never seen the inside of an airplane.  Just on TV.  Yeah.  And no one has ever seen the inside of you. 
[01:02:30]  Ho-hoo!  Hey!  Very funny.  Look at me being funny.  Got something in common.  Hey, great.  Okay.  No, no.  Greg from Philly, by the way, to backtrack a little bit.  The Boobalander contest is about as popular as a letter from Trenton.  Very funny.  Oh, wow.  That's pretty good.  We'll get someone down here for the Boobalander contest.  Hey, Patty.  Yes?  We want to make you into a Harry Kushner for the U2 tickets. 
[01:03:00]  What's that?  You know, Hare Krishna.  Hare Krishna.  One of those?  Yeah, George Harrison was one of those.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, I don't think he really went the limit with it.  No, no.  If you know what I mean, Patty.  Patty, for the U2 tickets.  Yeah?  We want you to come downstairs.  Yeah?  We're going to shave your head.  Oh, no.  I don't want to shave my head.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  We're going to shave your head and leave that cute little top of the head ponytail thing.  The little thing on top.  No, I like my hair. 
[01:03:30]  Well, no one else does.  Come on.  Oh.  Not even for the edge, huh?  No, I don't want to do that.  It'll grow back.  Believe me, I shave my head once a week.  It comes back, stupid.  No, I got to work and everything.  Put a hat on.  No.  No one's looking at you.  Oh, I don't want to shave my head.  How much money will it take?  No, I'm not doing that.  No.  I need.  Not my hair.  We all know you need money.  I know.  We will take up a collection.  U2 tickets plus cash. 
[01:04:00]  But not my head.  I don't want that.  Because you know why I have to work and everything, you know?  Oh, come on.  You just get some cute little hats.  You're short on cash.  You could probably get cancer benefits just from the look of you.  No, I don't mind a short haircut, but not my head saved.  No, I can't do that.  There's a cat.  It grows back.  No.  Plus, you'll have the Harry Kushner ponytail thing.  Yeah, that'll help.  You could style it differently after the bit.  Oh, I don't think.  No, no, not my hair. 
[01:04:30]  It's for U2 tickets.  Oh, I know, I know.  But I don't want to change my appearance like that.  What would Edge think?  What would Edge think, Patty?  Plus, we're going to throw in some cash.  No, I don't want to save my head, though.  We're talking at least a couple thousand dollars cash in your pocket.  Oh, my God.  The hair will grow back so fast you won't even know it.  Yeah.  And you can wear hats in the meantime.  And you'll have a place to live.  That's right.  So I'm going to look ugly.  Well, all right.  Start your own joke right here. 
[01:05:00]  See, this one.  We don't take the easy ones.  You guys can have that one.  Put your own joke.  I mean.  That's a slow pit softball.  You hit it over the fence.  But I just love my hair.  A-B-C, you later.  Patty, I really, I like you.  You're my friend.  Your hair is horrendous.  Yeah.  Patty, it might look better when it grows back.  Yeah, but not today.  Look what it did for Sinead O'Connor.  Right.  Give me more.  Give me more.  Give me more.  Hot.  Because nothing can piss. 
[01:05:30]  Nothing can piss to you.  I mean, I won't mind a short, short haircut.  That won't bother me.  What's the fun in that?  Oh, no.  Shave.  We want Sigourney Weaver Penal Colony short.  Well, what do my dad say when I go to work and they see me and everything, you know?  Well, yeah, you wear hats.  Nothing they don't say already, Patty.  Yeah.  They'll just wish you death and snicker now.  What do you say? 
[01:06:00]  I don't know.  I don't...  You two tickets.  Well, I know, but save my head.  Why?  Money for a place to live.  Money for a place to live.  Why?  Can you leave some hair?  Yeah, the little Harry Krishna ponytail thing.  That's what you'll have.  I don't want a shiny, bald head.  That's okay.  It'll grow back.  Not that bad.  You can...  You look, like, really, really short, maybe, but I like hair. 
[01:06:30]  How about crew cut?  Flat top.  Flat top.  Marine cut.  Marine cut.  Uh, a crew cut?  A crew cut.  I'm not a dike or anything.  You're talking a mighty fine.  How do you know?  You've never had man meat either.  What's your name, Ant Body?  You are a disgusting Ant Body.  You want something that'll make me look pretty.  You know, like a lady.  How about a ski mask and a shotgun with a toe attachment? 
[01:07:00]  You know, can we compromise here?  Well, we want a crew cut, at the very least.  I'm talking a buzz cut that they call a mighty fine or a velvet top.  Well, I have bangs and sideburns.  I want to look like a lady.  How about crew cut with bangs?  Like a reverse mullet?  We'll do crew cut with bangs.  Crew cut with bangs, Patty. 
[01:07:30]  But don't make me look like a guy.  Too late.  You know, I'm feminine, you know?  You're feminine?  Feminine.  Yeah.  I'm a girl.  You know what I mean?  I'm a lady.  I want to look like one.  Prove it.  Patty, we have a radio show to do.  Are you going to do this for the U2 tickets?  U2 tickets.  And cash.  And some cash for a place to live, Patty.  You don't even have a place to live.  Most people trade hair pie for places to live when they're desperate. 
[01:08:00]  Your chick's always got the bank of vag to go back on.  If I let you do it, will you not make me look ugly?  Again, own place right there.  How?  Slip your own punchline, your own funny gag line right in there, people at home.  Patty, you know what a crew cut looks like?  Yeah.  Yeah, I do.  These are your options.  Name some people that look cute with a crew cut.  Have there been any girls that have...  Demi Moore looked hot.  Demi Moore, remember?  What was that?  What movie was that?  G.I. Jane. 
[01:08:30]  G.I. Jane.  Sigourney Weaver and the Aliens, like you mentioned.  Oh, there you go.  Right.  Sigourney Weaver.  She had some sex scene in there, too, and didn't look all that bad.  Didn't look bad at all.  Sinead O'Connor.  Every woman in the military, Patty.  Golf ball-eyed Susan Sarandon.  That's right.  I don't know if she's ever had one, but I really needed to say that again.  Patty, I wouldn't go for the crew cut, because then it'll be a little, like, flat top on the top.  You've got to just shave the whole thing.  Oh, but I don't want a ball-eyed.  It comes back in a week, Patty.  How about... 
[01:09:00]  All right, how about, like, how Norton wears his?  But that's also, like, ball-toe.  I'm not a man, you know.  I'm a woman.  It grows back so fast.  A little water.  P-p-p-p-Patty.  It's back.  P-p-p-p-Patty.  Yeah, we'll call you Chia Patty.  Chia Patty.  Everyone is calling you.  Judy's like, she's such a whiner.  This is a good thing.  You two tickets and cash to find a place.  Yeah.  Look, we've got the razor right here. 
[01:09:30]  Patty, it grows back.  Oh, way to go.  Razor?  Opak's checking in, Patty, and he says, what makes you look ugly?  It's other people's vision.  Very, very good.  Nice.  What do you say, Patty?  It's very funny.  Patty?  Crocod?  I mean, broadly?  I don't know.  I don't think...  Get Earl.  Get Earl on the mic.  Earl.  What is the highest setting on your razor? 
[01:10:00]  Like, how short will the hair be?  You have stubs.  You can go down to nothing or...  Nothing.  Nothing or stubs.  Stubs would be...  My hair.  But you can go a little higher, too, right?  You can go a little higher, right?  You got the attachment that goes on the end?  Oh, yeah.  There it is.  Oh, there it is.  Okay.  And it's got...  What is that?  A flow bee?  What the hell are you sporting there?  It's a brawn shaver.  A brawn shaver.  There you go.  Just tell everyone you're doing it for Halloween.  It's part of your costume.  Hey, Patty, there you go.  Then you can dress up like, um... 
[01:10:30]  Like what?  Like an Auschwitz victim.  Like an Auschwitz victim.  Okay.  Wouldn't that be fun?  You pull up to a Halloween party in a car disguised as a boxcar.  And, Patty, you'll get all the benefits of radiation treatment without that pesky tumor.  See?  Hey, you could get out for a Halloween party.  Some guy in jack boots and a sharp-looking hat can give you a thumbs down.  How about a mohawk?  A mohawk?  That wouldn't go over good with my jobs.  I'd be fired.  What?  What?  Are they against the Indians?  Well, we're not allowed to look like that. 
[01:11:00]  Just say you're going as a mohegan.  Patty, we can't waste all day.  Come on, Patty.  It's Halloween coming up, Patty.  You gotta...  What do other listeners think?  They want this done like you wouldn't believe.  Patty, if we randomly take a few calls from listeners and they say to do it, will you do it?  Come on.  Um, let me hear what they have to say.  It'll grow back.  How about we give her the Pete Rose?  You want the Pete Rose?  Also known as the Down Syndrome haircut.  Down Syndrome or the Asian or the mo. 
[01:11:30]  Moe Howard.  Well, that sounds okay, because I still have hair.  Well, no.  So, Patty, let me tell you what you can do.  Thank you, Kevin.  You're brilliant on line two.  I can't go to you because we're going a little long here.  Kevin suggests that you just get a wig.  The wigs that are out today for the ladies is great.  Oh, yeah.  A wig?  Yeah, so what happens is you get your hair completely shaved off and you could go get a wig.  No one will even know the difference.  How about that? 
[01:12:00]  Maybe we can even find somebody.  Maybe some sales slob here can actually find a wig place.  I don't want to leave this building with that one.  You'll have a wig.  We have to do that today.  So, even if you've got to wear the, I have the new Jan Brady wig.  Right.  You know.  Then we'll get you a better one.  What do you say, Patty?  Well, as long as I can hide it.  The wigs are great today.  And then it'll grow in underneath and it'll be fine.  Maybe we could give you a different wig for every day.  What do you say?  All right. 
[01:12:30]  It's a little weird.  I'm kind of scared, but...  Patty, it's hair.  As long as I have a wig, okay.  All right.  Get down here.  We'll get you a wig.  Someone run to the studio with wigs right now.  Right now for Patty.  This must be immediate.  Run, run.  I don't care how many people show up with wigs.  Run to the studio right now with wigs.  Run!  Okay.  I'll be up here.  Okay.  I'll be waiting.  All right.  All right.  You just sit down and calm your nerves. 
[01:13:00]  Don't leak yourself, okay?  Okay.  Get her into this room over here on the side so she can't...  So none of her stupid friends upstairs can talk her out of it.  All right.  Patty, we'll come get you.  Okay.  Bye.  All right.  All right.  We need to take up a collection.  Oh, there we go.  We need to get some wigs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We need some cash.  It's a cash that doesn't jingle.  $1.25.  We're doing good so far.  What are we having?  Patty cash.  Patty cash. 
[01:13:30]  Patty cash.  $1.25.  There you go.  Patty cash.  I threw in a fin.  Look at you.  All right.  I'll be up for some...  All right.  We're going to have to take a break.  Still waiting for the first lady to show up for the boob-a-lantern contest.  I don't understand what's going on.  Come on!  A chance for you ladies to be stars.  If you have breast implants, you've got to come down so we can light up your boobs, okay?  That's funny.  Ed has a vision of Patty looking like Uncle Fest. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  Gomez.  There's Patty.  Get her in here.  It'll actually be a cute look.  It'll grow back.  Yeah.  Now we'll be able to see her antennae.  Patty.  Patty.  What kind of coach are you on?  Give me a...  Patty.  What takes her so long to get in?  What takes her so goddamn long to get in?  Patty, we've wasted so much time on you.  Patty, don't you realize on the air is important?  Doesn't matter who you're talking to out there? 
[01:14:30]  She's ripping off Earl.  What are you doing?  All right, Patty.  There you go.  So for the U2 tickets, you'll shave your head, right?  Pull your hair, like pull your hair in a ponytail, tight ponytail, and go ahead.  Now pull your bangs up.  Let me see.  Pull your bangs up with your hand.  I totally see it.  All right.  Sure.  Yeah.  That's not...  There's nothing bad there.  What's the problem?  I don't think the receding hairline will come into play.  I think it'll be fine.  No.  Yes.  That'll look great.  Didn't hurt Nicholson's career.  There you go. 
[01:15:00]  Look.  Look.  See?  Can't you kind of visualize?  I bet you have a very pleasantly shaped head.  I bet you do.  It's not surgery.  I do it every week.  Come on.  It's meaningless.  It grows back so fast.  It is antlake.  We'll get you a wig.  It really is.  Yeah.  I would have to wear one if I want to go to work again.  We'll get you a wig.  Someone get down here with a wig.  That won't hurt your antenna.  Because we'll even, you know, we'll let her try on the wigs before we do the hair thing. 
[01:15:30]  All right?  Patty, the thing is, though, Patty, if we get a wig down here for you, you can't then try  it on and go, I don't like this one.  Oh, no.  If it's a normal wig, not a big Afro wig or a red, white, and blue wacky football fan  wig or something.  We'll give you the sign, John 316, as you leave here with your multicolored Afro wig.  That's practically my haircut.  Hey.  All right.  We're going to figure this out. 
[01:16:00]  Where are we today?  All right.  Shut up, Patty.  We got lots going on.  We need someone to show up with a wig.  Many wigs would be nice if we could, you know, try out a few.  Also, the Boobalanner contest is going on.  Ladies, if you enter the contest today or tomorrow, you'll be in the drawing for you two tickets  for tomorrow night's show at the garden.  A little extra incentive, okay?  Come on, ladies, with implants.  Between now and seven, get your asses down here, okay?  Right.  First prize is a thousand for the eventual winner. 
[01:16:30]  That's real cash, people.  And up next, the anti-terror checklist.  A book some guy wrote.  All right.  Let me thumb through that.  It's about 20 pages long.  That's all you need.  To avoid the terrorism.  It says on the back, be ready for anything.  Explosives, biological weapons, chemical weapons, nuclear weapons.  How do you prepare for that?  Protect yourself.  Get under a school desk is what they used to teach us back in elementary school.  Who knew the power of the school desk? 
[01:17:00]  All right.  We'll talk to this guy next, see what he's all about.  All right?  All right.  All right.  Something strange is happening here.  There's something wrong with us.  How do we play what's in my pants?  Something very, very wrong with us.  What's a little contributing to the delinquency of a minor?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Guess that's in teens' pants.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  The crystal method, Anthony.  We're going to be hanging with these guys at the Grave Rave in Boston next week. 
[01:17:30]  Can't wait.  We have lots of Grave Rave tickets to give away, by the way.  Yeah.  A little busy right now, though.  A few things going on.  Yeah.  Rick just admitted that he was in a gay bar last week.  That ought to be good for 20 minutes in the barrel right there.  In a gay bar.  Well, it all started because...  Wait, Rachel, get here.  Get over here.  Rachel, our lovely intern.  Our beautiful intern.  She was dressed to kill on Friday, Anthony. 
[01:18:00]  Because she was celebrating her friend's birthday, right?  Her first birthday.  So we were asking about the little birthday gathering that they had Friday.  Uh-huh.  And she kind of has an attitude today.  And we were thinking maybe she has an attitude because she dressed to kill on Friday and nothing happened.  And she goes, duh, nothing was going to happen because I was hanging out with a bunch of gay guys, right?  Well, it was only one gay guy.  Actually, two.  That's all it takes.  It was all girls, pretty much. 
[01:18:30]  But you went to a gay bar where everyone was getting naked.  Well, the bartenders, I think it's part of the job to be half naked.  Just to wear these little tight shorty shorts.  And, like, work boots and no top.  And they're all, like, really, like, buh.  So Rachel was explaining to us, yeah, in these places that she goes every once in a while, right?  Yeah.  The guys insist on taking their shirts off as soon as they get into the bar, right?  Yeah, because it's like selling yourself to other guys.  So then Rick goes, where were you?  Were you at, what did you say, Rick? 
[01:19:00]  The Roxy.  The Roxy?  I'm like, and then Rachel goes to Rick, yeah, I was at Splash.  And Rick knows exactly what she's talking about.  And understands and knows that, yes, the guys do take their shirts off when they go into these clubs.  Oh, my.  Rick, did you take your shirt off?  And checked him at the door.  Rick said, yeah, they checked him at the door.  Then Rick goes, well, I was at one of these places recently by accident.  And that's when he realized he put his foot in his mouth and wanted to run and hide. 
[01:19:30]  Well, the foot will get the bad taste of sea out of your mouth anyway.  Rick, did you have to take your shirt off when you walked in?  No, I did not.  I think he's lying now.  No, I didn't.  How did you accidentally end up at a gay club where the men were taking their shirts off?  I was walking and I tripped.  I flew in the door and I landed in front of a glory goal.  I think he happened to just fall upon the gay night at the Roxy.  The Roxy is not a gay club. 
[01:20:00]  Rachel, nice try trying to, you know, protect me.  I know Rick hired you at all, but shut up.  I can think of a lot more than this, too.  Help us out with this one.  So you ended up accidentally in a gay place.  Well, it was gay night, and he didn't know.  Gay night.  Who knows?  You got to check the calendar for that type of thing.  Yeah.  They told me it wasn't going to be as bad, but as soon as I walked in, I...  Who were you with that you ended up at the gay night?  Just some friends.  Oh, my God.  Did somebody answer your singles ad? 
[01:20:30]  Fuck off on your head, producer.  You're taking brown nosing to a whole new level.  That's so messed up.  Oh, my God.  That's line of the month, and most people won't even get it.  Oh.  Jeez.  Wow, Rick.  So was it fabulous?  Yeah, fabulous time.  All the guys are taking their shirts off?  Hi, my name is Charles. 
[01:21:00]  That's what they do.  Oh, are you, Rick?  I mean, at the Co-Check, they check their freaking shirts.  They check their shirts so they can just wander around.  And they sag their pants down so you can see just the beginning of their crack.  Oh, butt crack.  They really check their shirts?  They really check their shirts.  You check your shirt and pull your pants down so you can see butt cracks.  I'll run for a topper.  Oh, ho, ho.  No, if you ask me, that's like an airport that turns on the runway lights, you know what  I mean?  Let's you know where to land your vessel.  That's pretty much it. 
[01:21:30]  And so they know what to look forward to.  Right.  Just the top.  Jay, what's up?  Hey, I want to know if Rick walked around and asked guys, coffee, tea, or me?  Oh.  From his porno days?  Oh, ho.  What you need is a handkerchief around your neck.  Oh, ho.  How's that for a topper?  Ho, ho.  Uh, Crazy Paul, what's up?  Yeah, how are you?  All right.  Hey, man.  All right, I'm over here at the Nina Hair Center on 7th Avenue with John Lee, the manager  here.  Yeah.  And he would like to know what type of wig he would like. 
[01:22:00]  Oh.  Get Patty in here.  Rick, we'll get back to you.  Don't worry.  Oh, don't worry, Rick.  Accidentally.  Patty, what kind of wig do you need?  Patty, what are you looking for as far as a wig goes?  We're at a wig store right now.  Crazy Paul.  Right.  I know what her hair looks like.  I don't have a shoulder length, uh, wavy brown hair.  Do you know what?  If you can explain to that gentleman, I know it's hard, what Patty looks like without using  some type of insect analogy.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Patty said what she needs.  It's very easy, Paul.  You need a shoulder length, uh, brown. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  All right.  I got, I got, I got short, I got a shoulder length hair brown, uh, with bangs in the front.  It's a little bit wavy, not all the way wavy.  There's only one problem.  I don't know if Patty's going to like it because it's clean and well kept.  It's clean and well kept.  Is that a bad thing?  Do you want to?  It's fine.  Oh, okay.  I wash my hair every other day.  All right, Paul, get down here, okay?  You got it.  I'm buying it now.  All right.  Bye.  Bye-bye.  Was it peeler night, Rick, down at the, uh, no?  Okay.  I was just, people are asking on instant feedback. 
[01:23:00]  I am merely getting their questions right to the source.  Peeler night.  Peeler night.  You said peeler.  That's funny, man.  Kathy, what's up?  Dude, stop it with her.  What?  What?  You're abusing her.  She's like one step less than retarded.  Don't let her, don't shave her head.  Would you stop it?  Patty is not retarded.  She's a college graduate.  Patty could think for herself.  And she wants to go see you two real bad.  You are bullying her into getting her head shaved. 
[01:23:30]  Well, bully you, you, you, uh.  You?  What?  Don't wreck our buzz.  Give her credit for making your own decision.  Why do you have to think for Patty?  No, after you tortured her for about ten minutes.  Answer my question, stupid.  For you two, how good are the scenes?  Real good.  Yeah, they're good.  And Kathy, we've trained Patty to the point where she knows that if she doesn't do this,  she won't be part of the own a family life.  I mean, why don't you just put a dildo on her head and throw donuts on it?  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I like that idea. 
[01:24:00]  That's a good idea.  Write that down, Rick.  Do that.  Ooh.  Thank you.  We'll do that next week.  And not food donuts.  You can't be used on baseball bats.  All right.  Don't ruin our buzz, Kathy.  Yeah, Kathy, you're going to need...  I want to speak to her.  No.  She's listening to you?  You're sea blocking.  You are sea blocking.  Yeah.  Patty.  I'm going to eat two shoes.  No, I'm not.  You are.  Go ahead.  I'm going to come in for the boob-a-lantern.  Well, get down here.  Well, come in.  Except you're going to need a campfire.  Yeah, what do we got?  A shiny through your head?  Watch that light up? 
[01:24:30]  The clear fluid in there?  You're an idiot.  Shut up, you.  Goodbye.  All right, back to Rick.  So, Rick.  All right, faggot.  How long did you end up staying at this gay bar that you walked into by accident?  Accidentally.  Now, I would think if you accidentally walked in, you'd go like,  hey-ho, ho.  Hey-ho-ay.  About, maybe not even about face.  Maybe you back out.  Whatever it takes.  But then you'd be out of there pretty quick.  How, uh...  And where was this accidentally gay bar?  What's in town here?  In town.  What part of Manhattan would it be? 
[01:25:00]  Like, uh, what is that called?  Chelsea.  Chelsea.  Did you at least honor the too thick, salty beverage minimum?  Chelsea.  Chelsea.  For the people, uh, all over the country, Norton said the only place in America where  they rent knee pads.  Right.  Just to give you an idea of Chelsea.  So, Chelsea, you stumble, oopsie-daisy, into a gay establishment.  Oops, I'm in Chelsea, and oops, I'm in a gay bar. 
[01:25:30]  Oh, gee, how'd that happen?  What do you do next?  Uh, how long did you spend inside this place?  Less than five minutes.  Less than five minutes.  That's five minutes too long.  Less than five minutes, which means, all right, five, ten minutes.  Well, less than five minutes, literally.  Why less than five minutes, Rick?  Because I couldn't deal with it.  You couldn't deal with it.  So, then you went to another gay bar?  No.  Did you feel fat? 
[01:26:00]  The lighting wasn't right in the place.  No, actually, then, uh, we went...  Not used to seeing the stools turned upside down?  Right.  Fit for a press.  That old gag.  Then went over to Privilege.  Oh!  Oh, hey!  Oh, hey!  Hey!  Forget the gayness now, right?  Hey, let's go see some strippers.  Nice.  We went to Privilege and talked about the NFL.  Yeah, and watch some boobs.  Gotta wash off the fat.  An ass.  Nice.  Right?  Yeah.  And how long were you at Privilege? 
[01:26:30]  For about an hour and a half.  Hey, hey, old man.  And the gay guys that you were with, did they enjoy Privilege?  They stayed at Roxy.  I went with, um, the two chicks I was with.  Flat lever.  You flat lever.  That's right.  Between that and the freaking guys with the little knapsacks on the sack dancing.  Frank, Frank on the instant feedback.  O&A, exactly what part of Rick was hanging out at the bar?  Oh.  Oh.  As if we didn't already know. 
[01:27:00]  His unfeeling.  And Joey Bigarm saying, Rick wasn't at the gay club that night.  It was, in fact, Mad Max.  Rick's alter ego.  Which makes it okay, right?  Five minutes gay time is about an hour and a half.  If you do the conversion.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Five minutes.  Accidentally. 
[01:27:30]  That's cute.  Cute little story.  All right.  Let's go to Heather.  Heather, what's up?  I'm coming down tomorrow with my woman for the boobo lantern.  Oh.  You got implants?  No, she does.  She does?  Yes.  Does she know she's doing this yet?  Oh, yes.  I just called her and told her.  All right.  We need ladies to come down today.  That's why we put the U2.  She's going to work now.  We put the U2 tickets on the line.  Well, you'll still be qualified for the U2 tickets if you come down tomorrow.  Well, she had to go to work today.  You either come down today or tomorrow to enter for the U2 tickets.  All right?  Tomorrow we're coming.  And then the rest of the week we do boobo lantern. 
[01:28:00]  We do it Monday and Tuesday in Boston.  And grand prize will be $1,000.  All right.  We'll see you tomorrow, Heather.  Thank you.  Cool.  Don't check it out.  We're going to need you.  We're not.  We're going to come.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  Was Rick wearing his eyeliner?  Did they play lover boy at the gay bar?  And was the guy's name checking the shirts Jay Moore?  How does Jay get dragged into this?  Did you find a spot right outside the club for the yellow Miata?  Oh, that's right.  Oh, God damn.  They must have thought.  Hey, because their ship had come in. 
[01:28:30]  Because we all know lots of straight guys in the New York area drive around in yellow Miatas.  Look, it's a Miata.  Oh.  Oh.  All right.  People that haven't seen Rick, Rick is very well built, too.  Rick is a strapping young buck.  He's not, like, flabby.  Rick is really strapping young buck.  Shut up.  Rick, I've got to ask you.  And you've got to be honest.  And I know you well enough to know if you're answering honestly or not.  No, give him credit.  When he gets in these situations, he plays it out to the end. 
[01:29:00]  That's why I want an honest answer here.  When you walked in, how many of the gay guys turned around and looked at you with love in their eyes?  You must have been chum.  Were you chum?  I was chum.  But the joke's on them, because I'm not gay.  Right.  He must have walked in, though, and they were just like, ooh.  Look, new meat, you know?  It's like when you hang out at your local bar, and it's the same chicks that are hanging out getting sauced every night. 
[01:29:30]  And then, like, the door opens up, and that hot chick walks in.  You're like, hey, who's this?  It's fresh meat.  It's not the normal Chelsea schlong coming through the door.  That's Rick.  That's Rick coming in.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Did they offer to push in your stool?  That's disgusting.  Wow.  My God. 
[01:30:00]  Was the steam escaping from that club?  Like Britney Spears walking into Oz, huh?  Were you carrying your chocolate penis with you?  Hey, remember that?  All right.  People don't know about that, either.  Various chocolates were brought in here a while back in the shape of male's units.  That was like seven units.  And female boobs and whatnot.  And everyone was taking little bites out of the female boobs and whatnot. 
[01:30:30]  Rick chose this huge, veiny chocolate male member to snack on during the show.  He just comes in casually, gnawing on it.  He comes in.  He's talking like, hey, guys, there's a call outside.  And we're like, he's gnawing on this big, brown, veiny chocolate member.  And he's not thinking anything up.  He just walks in like, oh, it's unbelievable.  Because everyone else is nibbling on the little nips. 
[01:31:00]  And as he's going down the checklist of the show.  Yeah, yeah.  He's just gnawing away.  So, guys are like, feiny one, too.  Hey, Fabio, what's up?  Yeah, I know why Rick was only there for five minutes.  Oh.  He's a two-pump chump.  Oh.  Thank you, bro.  Thomas, what's going on?  How you doing?  All right.  No, I got trapped there also.  I got my friend dragged me out with a bunch of friends from the city.  And we were all going.  And there were chicks with us also. 
[01:31:30]  And he doesn't tell me that it's gay night.  I was in college.  I walk in there.  I proceed to, you know, I felt like I was in Star Wars, all these colorful people.  I proceed to get smashed.  And there's a stairway in the back.  So I'm sitting in the stairway.  It's like 3 o'clock in the morning.  And all these guys are making out all around me.  You're asking for it.  I'm asking for it.  I start to spin.  I start to spin.  I'm like, I got to get out of here.  I got to get out of here.  And next thing you know, I got a couple, two stairs ahead of me.  I start spinning, spinning, spinning. 
[01:32:00]  All over them.  Threw up.  All over them.  All down the stairs.  Everybody's standing around me.  All these gay guys making out.  Couples sitting on each other's laps staring at me.  So you threw up all over them and they threw up all over you.  Yeah, I just went downstairs and right out of there and wandered around.  Dude, you didn't throw up into someone's lap, did you?  No, on their backs.  Oh, God.  Who, a fetish guy.  Wait, someone is saying, roll the tape back.  What fag did Rick have to wash off? 
[01:32:30]  What?  Oh, yeah.  Well, he was talking about going to privilege and he says, well, you have to wash off the fag.  Oh, right, right, right.  That's right.  All right.  And was Rick wearing Tim Sabian slacks that night?  That's what Greg from Philly wants to know.  How many Cosmos did you drink in five minutes?  The Lewis.  What's up, Lewis?  Hey, dude, you got to stop picking on Rick.  It's not his fault that his boyfriend blindfolded him and said, let's go out and have a good time. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, God damn, Lewis.  Hold on.  Woo!  Woo!  Wow!  Thank you, Lewis.  Lewis?  He's traumatized.  Always.  Lewis, I tell you, every time he calls, it's the most unfunny thing ever.  Oh, Neil brings up a good point.  Neil, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I think we're finally seeing the residual effects of Rick's night in prison, huh? 
[01:33:30]  Yeah.  Taking it up the tailpipe, maybe?  What music was playing when you walked in?  What music was blaring?  I have no idea, but I didn't recognize it.  Oh, you didn't, did you?  Of course.  Did somebody cut their finger on the dance floor just clear?  It's raining, man.  Hallelujah.  All right.  What's it? 
[01:34:00]  Eat your own byproduct tonight.  These people are horrible.  You're getting pounded.  Lewis checking in saying, I'm ashamed to have the same name as that guy.  Yeah.  All right.  Lewis, never funny.  All right.  Everyone checking in on instant feedback.  All right.  We're patiently waiting for the wig to show up so Stalker Patty can get her headshade for  the U2 tickets.  Hey, Rick.  Homo esta? 
[01:34:30]  That's funny.  Can I say that Patty's cheeks are not looking that bad?  Oh, are you checking out Patty's ass?  I'm really, I'm not even joking.  The cheeks are not, I mean, turn sideways a little bit.  They're not that bad.  She's getting an ET quality to her body though.  Patty, you got to understand something.  Gravity.  It's your enemy at this point.  And what you're doing there by not working out that lower section with some sex, it's  all heaping down on top of your pelvis. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  Oh, you mean my tummy?  Tummy?  No, no.  Again, Brittany, tummy.  Christina Aguilera shows some tummy.  You know?  They're cute tummies.  You?  What would you call that?  Blubber.  Bunt.  Bunt.  You're getting a, you're a skinny woman and you're getting a bunt.  Well, my stomach sticks out.  Those are, that's like, that's your ovaries screaming.  Please give me some use. 
[01:35:30]  What are you doing?  You need, I don't, I know nobody on the radio can see it, but those shoes really make me want  to sever your feet.  Oh.  That's your cervix screaming to get out.  Those are awful.  All right.  Well, Patty, are you getting psyched to get your head shaved?  Yeah.  You have the loneliest genitals.  They have to be the loneliest things.  Lonely genitals and pilgrim shoes.  Oh, I know. 
[01:36:00]  Look at those step on the Plymouth Rock looking things.  Stupid John Standish shoes.  I know in the next couple weeks I got to get an attractive pair of sneakers for the cold  weather from me.  Barbara.  Care.  Barbara.  Yes.  What's wrong?  Barbara.  My name is Barbara.  I'm calling about Patty's head being shaved.  I think it's terrible.  She was very, very pressured.  She doesn't want to do it.  It's very obvious she doesn't want to do it.  She's doing it because she feels like she won't be part of the show anymore. 
[01:36:30]  Well, that's true, though.  She has no confidence in herself and she's got to go to work looking like that.  Barbara has a wig and a wig looks terrible.  Babs?  If I may, Babs?  The only way a wig can look good is if you spend thousands of dollars for one.  All right.  Just hold on.  Why can't you give Patty a little credit for making her own decision?  Yeah.  What is this codependent rescue mission that a lot of fat chicks are on?  She can make her own decision.  Yeah.  I think she's going to look lovely with her new haircut.  And it is true if she doesn't do this that she's not part of the O&A family.  Yeah.  Well, I think it's terrible. 
[01:37:00]  I tell you, if Patty's listening, please, Patty, do not shave your head.  Do not shave your head.  How heavy a gal are you?  I miss Don and Mike so much.  I just had to put the show on today.  Shut up.  And I really miss Don and Mike.  Bring me my tea, Barbara.  Twilight Zone, I love that one.  She hung up.  Barbara, you twat.  Big fatty from D.C.  I look at it this way.  When it grows in, it'll probably look better.  It'll look better, and you'll be a star.  I mean, your pictures will be on the website. 
[01:37:30]  I'm like, oh, look, look what Stalker Patty did.  Patty, you know what you've got to do?  We'll get you some hair care products and stuff.  That way, as it grows in, you can condition it so that when it gets to this length, it doesn't look quite so...  Janis Joplin 10 minutes after O.D.  After the O.D.?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a little...  You know, it doesn't look like your condition.  Right.  Yeah.  Oh, I might use the wrong stuff on my hair, too.  It's got the bounce of a brick.  I'm going to have to talk to Allison again.  Oh, who cares?  Of course. 
[01:38:00]  Hey, this just in on the answer of feedback from Tommy.  Lewis, radio anthrax.  We've been hit.  We've been hit by radio anthrax.  Barbara really bugged me.  Hey, we've got to get the terrorist expert in.  Yes, yes.  His name's Bill.  And we've got to talk to our pal Gary Ackerman.  We don't agree with anything this guy says, the politician.  Yeah.  But he's hilarious.  I want to hear his take on Hillary getting booed. 
[01:38:30]  I want to hear all that fun stuff.  And what is he doing that is so outrageous?  Gay Rick.  Roxy Rick.  Let's just call him Roxy Rick.  Oh, you dick.  Roxy Rick with a peelard.  Oh, hey.  So what is Mr. Ackerman doing?  Since they closed all the congressmen's offices, he's set up office in the parking lot down in Washington.  Oh, he's in a parking lot.  Parking lot.  He's set up a picnic table doing his business. 
[01:39:00]  Doing business.  Because he's not allowed back in his office yet.  That guy's insane.  He's set up a picnic table outside, and he's doing business.  He's crazy.  We love him.  All right.  We'll try to get him on the radio soon as well.  And we also have that fireman, right?  Mike Moran?  Actually, yeah.  He turned on his cell phone.  Oh, my God.  We've got so much to do today.  Stay there.  Now let's turn on the PA system and start the fun.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Afternoon Radio.  This is it.  You can't go anywhere else. 
[01:39:30]  Nowhere to go.  That's like saying you don't like Earth.  You're leaving.  Where are you going?  Opie and Anthony.  And we finally have control.  Yes.  Gets better every day, don't it?  And welcome back to the Opie and Anthony Show.  In case you're away from your radio for the past hour, still no ladies for the Boobo Lantern Contest.  We stink.  That's ridiculous.  That's ridiculous. 
[01:40:00]  What an idiot.  Is that Paul?  That's Paul.  Ladies, if you have a breath in place, help us out with the Boobo Lantern Contest.  Paul, how is Patty going to wear that wig?  You don't think it'll look good?  Come on.  It looks like Paul Stanley from the Lick It Up video.  No, it's my hair.  You know that.  Come on.  You told me not to do any douchebag things, so I got a normal one.  This ain't the exact one.  Wait, did you walk around like that?  I thought that was a wig. 
[01:40:30]  No.  No, I did it just for the purpose of this.  Oh, you want a camera, you twinkie?  Get out of here.  Twinkie.  Yeah, he's got queen fillet in his head.  Not much up there.  No, that's your new hairstyle.  Oh, I don't think so, but you've seen it a million times.  You've never seen it like this.  He usually has it, what, back or something.  Right.  Yeah.  There you go.  Wow.  Mr. Lee was very nice.  He called me up and told me he put the wrong one in the bag.  If she doesn't like this one exactly, the other one's a little more.  All right, break out the wig and let's put it on Patty's head and see if it's going to  do the job, right?  All right.  Open that up.  Get Patty in here. 
[01:41:00]  Now, Patty, these things can be, you know, styled and whatnot into whatever you would like.  Man, you know.  I don't know how these things work.  You know, instead of like hot girls showing off their breast implants today, what happened?  Well, what is that one?  That looks like Norman Bates' mother's wig.  Well, he said he put the wrong one in the bag.  The wrong one?  Yeah, there were two on the counter.  He put the wrong one in the bag.  Let's see it.  All right, Rick, help Patty put the wig on.  Okay, it's got a hair net on it.  Oh, it's got a net on it. 
[01:41:30]  Well, get the goddamn net off.  We're going to need some.  Rachel, help her out a little bit.  That's actually a good color.  Hey, that looks pretty sexy.  That's nice, yeah.  Well, they put the wig on.  Our buddy Gary Ackerman is on the line, Anthony.  I think they call that Reagan shoe polish black.  I can't hear anything.  Gary.  Ah, Gary Ackerman.  Yeah, hi, guys.  I can hardly hear you.  I'm out in the street.  Yeah, I heard.  You're a congressman down there in Washington, and you still can't get back in your office,  so you have decided to set up shop, what, in the parking lot? 
[01:42:00]  I'm in the parking lot right in front of the Capitol.  We've got a van with a tailgate, and I have the first congressional tailgate office.  You have a tailgate party going on.  A bridge table with a bunch of chairs, and we're sitting around, hours in the middle,  and a bunch of cell phones, and just talking to people.  What business are you conducting that you can do from a table in the parking lot?  Oh, it's wild.  I'm the only congressional office that's open.  We've had half of the New York delegation come over. 
[01:42:30]  A congressman from Arkansas came over with a constituent, because he can't get into his office.  Yeah.  The constituent went 1,700 miles from Arkansas with a 34-foot flatbed truck with a huge sign  that says, God bless America, pray for the victims, and he wants to know if he can get  it into New York before he drives the rest of the way.  Ah.  So we're working on that between the parking lot and our office in New York, trying to work  this out for him.  That's the latest one.  You're something, Gary.  He's the only one conducting business.  Hey, listen, you don't get paid to work, though.  Have you been tested, or your office tested for the anthrax? 
[01:43:00]  No, nobody in my office has been tested.  No one in your office, or they're not taking any preventative medication or anything?  Nope.  Nope.  Everybody is working from wherever they're working right now.  Are you worried a little, Gary?  Well, we're worried.  We're not scared.  Well, what's the vibe going on?  What do they feel?  How is this going to end?  What are we going to do?  We don't know.  You know, that's why people are so concerned.  We don't know what the end game is.  You know, if we could find Bin Laden and his top guys and bring them to justice, as the 
[01:43:30]  phrase goes.  I hear we dropped a bomb on one of his caves, and he's doing business from a picnic table  outside another cave with some cell phones.  You know something?  Is this guy setting up a table next to mine?  He's ripping you off.  He's ripping you off, Gary.  Gary, one of our favorites.  But I've got to tell, politically, we don't really see eye to eye.  How do you feel about the way the president is handling this crisis?  I think the president is doing a great job. 
[01:44:00]  You do?  You agree with the way we're handling Afghanistan?  By Parsons still alive, Anthony.  I like that.  You know, we are in troubled waters and uncertain waters and in uncertain times.  Yeah.  And it behooves us well to circle the wagon.  We've got one leader, one leader at a time.  And the president is the leader of the free world, and he's certainly the president of  our country.  Yeah.  He bothers the party, because when they blew up the World Trade Center, they didn't kill  Democrats.  They didn't kill Republicans.  They killed Americans.  Right.  So we can respond as Americans.  So you agree with the campaign there in Afghanistan and hopefully other places that harbor these 
[01:44:30]  villains?  Yeah.  Well, you know, we haven't seen it all played out yet, but so far I see no major missteps.  We're doing what we're supposed to be doing.  We're building a coalition.  You know, I have some questions and concerns about some of the statements that some people  are making about Israel, looking to find a scapegoat for this whole thing.  Yeah.  But the administration is fairly much on target in pursuing this in Afghanistan, and what they're 
[01:45:00]  doing to bolster up Pakistan.  Gary, what about this Cynthia McKinney?  Yeah, a disgrace.  An absolute disgrace.  Now, this woman, she's from Georgia?  Yeah, she's from Georgia.  And she wrote a letter of apology to...  Yeah, she wrote a letter of apology to the prince after Mayor Giuliani told him where  to put his $10 million check.  Yeah, this guy decides he's going to give a $10 million support check to New York, give 
[01:45:30]  it to Giuliani.  And it turns out this guy really has an anti-American agenda.  Yeah.  After he gave the check to the mayor and walked away, he then has people hand out a press  release afterwards, you know, basically saying, you know, questioning America's foreign policy  and saying that this is all the fault of our foreign policy and we'd better re-examine  that.  And the mayor told him where he could put the check and send it back.  Right.  He then writes a letter of apology to this sheik, this billionaire sheik, one of the richest  men in the world, who's bankrupted his entire country of Saudi Arabia. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah.  Where you have poor peasant people there, because he has, and his family has all the  money.  And she says, well, send it to me, because I'm going to give the $10 million to poor black  people in America, and there are human rights violations here in Israel, and I'm sorry you  were treated that way.  Oh, she...  You know, he can spend it in his own country.  We don't have any charity from Saudi Arabia.  So she's turning this into a black-white issue, too.  No, it's not a black-white issue.  I kind of see that.  Most of the black members of Congress agree wholeheartedly with me and with us, and do not share her point 
[01:46:30]  of view.  I don't know.  From the little excerpt I read from her note, it seems like she's trying to turn this into  a black-white issue.  Black-white?  Yeah.  Hello, Gary?  Hello?  Is his phone petering out?  I want one more thing from you, Gary.  Yeah.  It's okay.  A truck just went by.  The Hillary Clinton situation at the benefit concert at Madison Square Garden, where the  firefighters and police were booing her.  Did you see that?  Yes, I did.  And what are your feelings about that, being a Democrat? 
[01:47:00]  Well, you know, they're entitled to their viewpoint.  But at a time like this, when everybody's trying to be supportive, and when she came out with  such strong support of the president, and I was there the first day when the president  called us the day after the attack, and she helped lead the charge for us in the White  House telling the president, are sticking behind him.  And she's somebody, basically, who got picked apart during the time she was in the White  House, because she knows what that's all about.  But she really didn't deserve that.  She came there to be supportive of them, whatever they think of her politics. 
[01:47:30]  She was not there for politics.  She was there for patriotism and for moral support.  She is the senator from the state of New York.  He is the president of the United States, and we're going to have to learn to be respectful  of each other.  And I don't know that she's ever been disrespectful of the firefighters or the police.  Well, yeah, the police, there have been some instances where you could say, yes, she's  been a little disrespectful.  I can't think of any.  Well, I could think of a few times where the police were involved in a shooting, and she  is kind of sided against the police. 
[01:48:00]  You know?  Let me tell you something.  I love the police.  That doesn't mean they're right all the time, and it doesn't mean they can't be criticized.  I'm right all the time, and I get criticized.  So, you know, what are you going to do?  That's the politics.  And I think Sunday, when she was being booed, I think that's really the first situation.  She's been in an appearance that was completely out of her people's control.  And it kind of bit her in the ass when you've got a group of people there that kind of see  through some of the things that she pulls here in New York. 
[01:48:30]  I think she shows up a lot to get her face out there.  And I truly believe that her being senator of this state is a stepping stone to aspirations  she has for down the road.  You know what I mean?  How come when every other senator who happens to be a guy shows up at places, you know, would  you be mad at Chuck Schumer if I said some people think he should have aspirations to  being president, or Joe Lieberman, or any other senator?  Well, wherever you find Hillary, you find Chuck.  That's all the time, because people say she wants to be senator.  She wants to be president. 
[01:49:00]  And even if she does, so what?  But she doesn't come across as somebody that really cares about this state or about the  people.  I think she comes across as somebody who sees which way the polls are going and goes in  that direction and tries to please people.  But it's not based on how she feels.  I never get that feeling from her.  I've seen her take positions that are very contrary to what major public opinion might  be, and, you know, and do things that might be publicly unpopular. 
[01:49:30]  I've seen her in other situations with crowds that are absolutely adoring and swooning,  and, you know, whether they're blacks or whites or upstate or downstate, you know, all  over the place.  Usually Democrats.  I was with her out on Long Island, right near Rick Lazio's district the other day.  She opened the district office in my district, but right next door to his.  People showed up from all over.  Whether it was, you know, screaming and chanting and happy.  Well, they were screaming and chanting.  It depends on where you are.  The police don't like her.  The police don't like the mayor either, by the way. 
[01:50:00]  They hate him.  Yeah, but you know something?  The mayor came out.  We had a lot of problems with Giuliani.  We voiced him many times, his policies, his morality, trying to squeak that into our lives  and stuff, and I never liked that.  But when this happened, September 11th, the guy showed nothing but care for this city and  leadership.  And all I saw from Hillary, I'm sorry, is photo ops.  And I'm really... 
[01:50:30]  All people in politics, the mayor, myself, the president, everybody else, and the president,  regardless of who it is, schedules photo ops in the White House.  I mean, that's part of politics.  Yeah, I'm not feeling it.  But that's the way it goes.  She's a politician, and she's going to take her lumps, and she's going to get applauded  by the people who want to be applauded.  I just thought that was the wrong day to do that.  But that was a day for everybody to be together.  You know, you had one guy go out there on stage and try to explain his point of view on  Hinduism or something, and that was wrong on that day. 
[01:51:00]  Richard Gere?  No, and you know something, Gary?  When you've got an audience full of people that have loved ones that have been killed  while we were sitting back and enjoying the prosperity in this country, they don't want  to hear peaceful, and we should turn this around.  They want justice.  They want vengeance, and they want something in return for their loved ones being taken  away.  They don't want some Hollywood schmuck that doesn't even understand the real man telling  them how they should feel and how they should turn around their anger. 
[01:51:30]  Screw that, man.  You're right.  I'm not disagreeing.  I was making that point.  I thought it was nice for him to do that.  That was not the time for that.  How do you feel about a gollip boy and bald-eyed Susan Sarandon?  That's great.  If it's different than everybody else's, that's fine, too, in America.  But that was not the time or the place for it.  I mean, there were kids that were there that lost their father that was hearing him make  an excuse for why these people killed the kid's father.  No, it was not the time or place for Richard Gere to put his politics in on it either. 
[01:52:00]  All right.  If you want to have an intellectual debate with you or me or whatever, that's fine, but  not there.  All right, Gary.  It was out of place.  I think booing the senator or any senator who came to express support, and that's what  she did, was kind of the wrong time.  See, that's right to not like her.  I'm not saying that.  All right, Gary.  We're running out of time, but when you're tailgating there, put a hot dog and a burger  on for me.  You guys are okay terrific.  Did I ever tell you that?  It's keep terrific.  Keep terrific, Gary.  Keep terrific.  All right, man.  Bye.  Okay.  Be good.  Here he goes. 
[01:52:30]  Gary Ackerman.  Boy, we don't see eye to eye, man.  I am constantly at odds with that man.  But there's something about him.  But there's something about him.  He's a pisser.  I love him.  You know what?  He is doing business.  He is genuinely a pisser.  Sitting at a picnic table in Washington right now.  He's a fun guy, but man, politically, he just doesn't get it.  Where's he from?  He's from out on Long Island, Nassau County.  Long Island.  Let's see, Patty.  Move over to Jim Noren so we can see the wig that Paul brought in for you.  Oh.  Wow.  It's sort of a Pulp Fiction thing she's got going there. 
[01:53:00]  The I'm Ready to Murder Garp.  That's not too bad, Patty.  And with the rest of your hair gone so it sits better on your head, I think that'll look good in black.  What do you think, Patty?  All right.  I think you'll like it.  Yeah, I think you can go to work like that.  I think you could absolutely go to work like that.  I could just tell them, you know, well, I got a friend to do my hair and collar it and everything, because I've done that before.  Yeah.  Rick, did you take a picture of Patty in her new wig?  Oh, yeah.  Nice, right?  And then you got to, you know, put that up on opiananthony.com. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, yeah.  Did you get a before shot?  No, I should get one of those.  You needed three shots.  The before Patty shot, the shaved Patty, and then the one with the wig on.  The one with the wig on.  Wow, Patty.  I'm pretty impressed.  And that is a Nina original that you're wearing there.  I like that.  A Nina original?  Yeah.  Sure.  I kind of like the little curl there thing going there at the bottom.  Bit of a Betty Boop.  Put it back into a ponytail.  Yeah, of the Betty Boop.  You could maybe put it back in a little.  Put it back in the ponytail.  Pull it back a little bit. 
[01:54:00]  Sure, why not?  I wouldn't do that.  If you put it in a ponytail, it looks like one of those helmets they give you when you're  dressing that sumo wrestler, big fat suit, and they give you the helmet with the ponytail.  Shut up.  You're going to ruin it.  I said it when it's in the ponytail.  Down?  Opie, come on.  Down looking good.  That's beautiful.  Right.  I kind of like that.  You need a little more bang thing, though.  Is there a little more extra in there?  Oh, yeah.  Look.  Oh, wow.  Well, no, don't do that.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  No, no.  No, brush it away.  Go back the other way.  Yeah, yeah.  No, that one piece right there. 
[01:54:30]  Is that your real hair or that piece right there?  Sure.  Pull that out.  This might be my real hair, yeah.  No, no.  And now, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  That's the look.  Guys, what do you think?  Hot, right?  Is there a mirror?  Can I see a mirror?  If you bend over, is that going to fall in the deep fryer at McDonald's?  Because that would be a shame.  You really need a mirror?  I want to see what it looks like.  You saw the picture.  It looks good, actually.  Patty, you also got to understand, a lot of your hair is making it kind of stand up a little higher. 
[01:55:00]  Once that hair is gone, it'll sit better.  See, I'm a little worried.  And then you got to have somebody come in and brush it out for you.  I'm a little worried if you look in the mirror.  Why?  Well, the lights are a little bright in the bathroom.  No, let me see.  I think it looks good.  You should look at it.  I think it looks good.  You have your own hair coming out the front, though.  See, that's the problem.  Oh, I know.  I like the color.  And it's so shiny.  Why don't you go in the bathroom and fix the weight to make sure you're okay?  Take a look.  Look from the back.  That's how you're going to look for the next six months.  That's great.  All right. 
[01:55:30]  Kennedy had a better hairstyle after the shot.  There we go.  Mm-hmm.  It actually looks cute.  I thought I was going to be ready to tease her, but it actually looks nice.  Oh, a little short kind of Betty Boop, like you said, thing going there.  Well, the shorter hair is more in for women, you know, since the 70s.  I mean, so, you know, I think it actually looks better.  I was really ready to tease Patty, but it looks better than it did.  Oh, there you go.  And I hope she likes it in the mirror.  You got a little compliment from Norton. 
[01:56:00]  Are we ready to show you Patty's head?  Let's do it.  Earl's the shaver guy.  Get Earl.  He shaved Al Dukes' head from the Ron and Fez show on Friday.  Ron and Fez on after us here in New York.  They do a great job.  We're going to make Patty into Harry Kushner, right?  Yes.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Back into the left.  Back into the left.  What is Patty doing?  She's checking it out?  Is she out of the bathroom?  Yeah, she's in the bathroom adjusting and see how it's going to look. 
[01:56:30]  All right.  Sure.  That's great.  Let's go to Jerome.  Jerome, you're next on the show.  What's up?  Oh, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, don't forget Patty's still an ant.  Right.  Yes.  But what I wanted to say was that when you were talking to Gary Anthony, I wanted to help  you out, but he already hung up.  But it's more of the actions that Hillary Clinton has been doing and been showing us as New Yorkers  that, I guess, that brings out your anger, I guess, and your feelings towards how we all feel about her. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah, it's so obvious when you look at Hillary, the only way she was getting into office was the Democratic vote and a lot of people that they say don't normally vote.  You know what I mean?  To get the vote.  I'm so pissed off.  A lot of people that voted for Hillary are people that do not enjoy the New York Police Department.  It's the bottom line.  That's the way it is.  They are constantly bashing the NYPD.  So when Hillary was running, her whole platform was to not support the NYPD. 
[01:57:30]  That way she could get these constituents voting for her, the people that don't like the police department.  Do I have to spell it out for people?  Thank you.  Damn.  So now that she's coming back and takes the stage and there's firefighters and cops in the audience, what the hell is she expecting?  She's going to get booed.  Can we play that clip again?  Play it again.  Play it again.  Play it again.  Play it again.  Thanks, Jerome.  No problem.  All right.  Bye.  Thank you, thank you for being here tonight. 
[01:58:00]  Thank you for supporting New York.  Thank you for your generosity on behalf of all the people who are going to need help for a long time to come.  Now it's my great pleasure to introduce a video from someone who has a lot to say about New York who couldn't be here tonight.  Please join me in welcoming Jerry Seinfeld.  Please join me. 
[01:58:30]  Thank you.  She lost her voice.  Oh, my God.  She was screaming over that booing crowd.  Sergeant Rob, what's up?  Hey, O&A.  What's up?  Make it fast, because we've got to get back to Patty.  What's happening, man?  Rob.  Yeah, all right.  I think you caught me off.  Listen, I just wanted to say thanks to what you guys said to Gary.  You pretty much sum up the way the whole department feels, with the exception of about a hundred, if you know what I'm talking about, between the lines there.  Well, you know something?  You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure this woman out. 
[01:59:00]  That's why when you get someone like Gary, who we enjoy having on the show, but when he starts talking about this, I want to smack him in the head and go, are you blind?  Look at what this woman's done to get elected.  She totally hung you guys out to dry to get elected, because that's who was voting for her, people that do not like you.  So that when she finally gets in office, now she's behind the NYPD?  Go take a breather.  Get out of here.  No one wants to see you at a function supporting the cops or the fire department. 
[01:59:30]  Exactly.  Let's not forget her husband pardoned the Spanish terrorist from the FLAN who killed law enforcement personnel.  There you go.  Remember that one?  Because she hung by the balls.  I remember.  Listen, you guys are great.  Thank you for this call.  You guys are excellent.  Thanks a lot, Rob.  All right.  May I, for one second, re-quote the police officer Milo Yambag?  This is the best line I've ever read.  Please tell me you have audio of that lion, thick-ankled pig, Hillary. 
[02:00:00]  Those could be the finest five words I've ever read.  Lion, thick-ankled pig.  God, is that great?  Frank from Queens with a pretty good observation.  Was that Gary Ackerman or Opie doing an impression?  He didn't say a word.  The same way that Ant disappears whenever Reagan comes on.  I just knew I was out of my league and I didn't handle that very well for everybody.  And, actually, from here, you were kind of choreographing the future thing we're doing here with Patty.  Yeah, that's cool. 
[02:00:30]  And I love banging heads with that Gary Ackerman, that son of a bitch.  Patty, ready to go?  The wig looks good.  You're back from the bathroom.  You like it, Patty?  I like the wig, yeah.  You do?  I know.  Isn't it good?  I like the color.  I like the cut.  It's a little swoopy, curly thing at the bottom.  You almost look like those 70s United stewardess commercials, right?  Come fly me in the friendly skies.  Come on and fly me.  Together we'll fly.  Maybe that was national. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, my God.  She looks like, oh, God, the chick from that old sitcom.  Oh, crap.  She looks like Uma Thurman from Pulp Fiction after the OD.  Name some sitcom stars, dude.  Help me out here.  The author?  No.  Oh, God, it's killing me.  A sitcom star.  What?  From the 70s.  Mary Tyler Moore?  I know, that's the obvious.  The one with, um, the one that married, uh, Phil Donahue. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, oh, oh, my God.  That girl?  That girl.  Marlo Thomas.  Marlo Thomas from that girl.  Valerie Bertinelli, did you just say?  Valerie Bertinelli?  She was the flying nun.  No, she wasn't.  That was Sally Field.  Sally Field, I mean.  And you don't look like Valerie Bertinelli.  She's got the that girl hairdo going on.  If you find a girl to love, only one girl to love, then she'll be that girl to, that girl.  So, Patty walks past a window and sees somebody that looks just like her in the window in 
[02:02:00]  a dress.  Instead of winking, she flips at a bird.  Rachel, what do you think of Patty's wig?  Wonderful.  Oh, she's hot.  Oh, yeah, she's hot.  Does it look good, Patty?  It's hot?  Yeah.  Well, she does not have black hair naturally.  I mean, she's supposed to have light brown hair.  The change is great.  It's spiffy.  Very spiffy.  The dark black hair gives you kind of a beautiful look. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah, sure.  I like it.  Kind of gothic.  Oh, like a goth chick.  Kind of got a goth thing working.  I can see that.  Right?  You want to get some fangs?  Boo.  No?  You just need a...  Okay.  That's good.  All right, we got to take a...  Earl, get in here.  We got to take a break.  Show Patty the implement.  We got to take a break, and when we come back, we're going to shave...  This is great.  We're going to shave Patty's hair for U2 tickets. 
[02:03:00]  We're not going to break that.  Oh, my.  Look, I'm running, flying, the kite in Central Park.  Diamonds take these snowflakes, that girl.  Look at me running through Manhattan.  Yeah, she's got the flip.  It's the flip.  Yeah.  Who else had that?  Mrs. Brady had the same flip, only it was blonde. 
[02:03:30]  Look at that girl.  Nice Joey Ramone vibe.  And suddenly for you, if you point a girl to love, only one girl to love, then she'll be that girl too.  That girl.  Patty girl.  Oh, wow.  You know how I said you look kind of goth? 
[02:04:00]  Well, the label on the wig says, style, vampire.  Is it?  That's because of the black.  Because it's black, and it's goth.  It's kind of a bobcat.  That is not vampire.  No, it's the black.  It's a style and goth vampire.  Although, you know, as she wears it, I just want to plunge a wooden stake through her.  I don't know why, but, you know, it looks good, Patty.  All right, when we come back, we shave Patty's head.  Shaving Patty's head.  For your two tickets. 
[02:04:30]  Pull your pants down.  Can I see your taint whipped cream lesbian?  Let me see your butt.  Let me tell you about my balloon nut.  The OPR.  The OPR show.  Radio's own slag.  We got to go right to the phone.  Uncle John, what's going on today?  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  Pretty good.  I got a couple of questions.  Anthony.  Yeah.  Why in God's name do you know the words, the theme from That Girl?  That blew me away, and I...  And secondly, why would you admit it? 
[02:05:00]  I'll tell you something.  Everyone knows this.  I sat in front of televisions my whole life.  I think you sat in a Roxy too long, dude.  Yeah, that must be it.  Where they play the That Girl theme, if I ask Rick.  He knows.  They play sure.  They play a techno-style theme.  I got one more question for you.  Yeah.  Can I come into the studio today?  You guys convinced Patty to play Russian Roulette?  Russian Roulette with Stalker Patty next.  All right.  It'll get to that point.  As long as I can get some immediate medical attention so I got a chance. 
[02:05:30]  Steve from the NYPD wants in real fast.  Jim, I didn't have your mic on.  I'm sorry.  Hold on a sec.  Steve, what's up?  Yeah, how you doing?  First, I want to say thanks for doing such a great job of keeping us going through these  hard times.  We're trying.  Secondly, I wanted to say that at the concert the other night, which I was at, we were on  the first row of the second section on the main floor.  Yeah.  And I just wanted to let that liberal, sharp-in-loving bitch Sarandon.  Susan Sarandon?  You must be a golf-ball-eyed Susan Sarandon. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah, yeah, that's her.  I just want to let her know that when she was walking through the middle section and she  tripped and almost fell on her face, it wasn't an accident, Susan.  You know, somebody's foot came through the railing intentionally to drop your ass to the ground.  Now, whose foot was it?  It was one of the wives of one of our missing officers.  Yeah, there you go.  You know, so she had to get a little payback, so.  Another one.  Susan just happened to be walking through and she was the one.  Another one who lives on Venus.  Oops.  And wants to comment on the goings-on on our home planet of Earth. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Just like Gear.  Yeah, thank you, Steve.  That Buddhist.  All right, take care.  All right, cool.  Steve from the NYPD.  We have some guy in the studio.  What's your name?  It's Bill, right?  Bill Stanton.  That's correct.  He's been waiting for about two and a half hours outside of the studio, Anthony.  I feel like Luca Brasi sitting outside.  I'm going to kiss the ring.  I know.  We got distracted because.  Godfather.  Stalker Patty.  Yeah, now I know why you have the bodyguard in here.  I'm nervous myself.  Yeah.  Stalker Patty's going to get her head shaved for U2 tickets because she's a huge U2 fan. 
[02:07:00]  How about that?  As long as she doesn't have to go with me, I'm fine.  First impression of Stalker Patty.  Stalker Patty.  Absolutely.  Stalker.  Yeah, right?  It's like from the Matrix, only out of my nightmare.  You're a security guy, right?  Yeah, retired NYPD.  See?  Stalker.  That's what one looks like.  When I'm closer to you, I'll say you're a great girl.  But from this side of the table.  Do you know martial arts, sir?  A little bit.  Yeah.  I am?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's a big boy, this guy.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:07:30]  He's a big boy.  I just play tough.  I'm not really tough.  So you wrote a book about terrorism?  You've put together the anti-terror checklist?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Nationally renowned private investigator and security expert, Phil Stanton.  Looks like you spent a whole two and a half days on that book.  My book report.  It's a book report.  I believe it's in the pamphlet category.  Harper talks, Reagan books.  Reagan got some big names there.  28 on a bestseller list.  Oh, oh, oh.  People picking this up now.  Yeah, sure.  Now, what could this possibly do for the citizens out there? 
[02:08:00]  Well, I mean, it goes to the people and actually buy a smoke detector and change the batteries.  Oh.  You know, it's for that type of person.  The anal retentive.  Well, I wouldn't go that far.  It's if you if you have to get out of Dodge, you know, when the stuff hits the fan, you  go to that checklist, look at it, and then get the heck out of Dodge.  Oh, so it kind of gives you a little outline of what you should do if there is an evacuation.  If the phones go down, if the cell phones go down, how to get your family, how to get 
[02:08:30]  the granny's house.  Screw granny.  That bitch is burning.  She is barbecuing.  Granny, she had a good life.  Breathe through your diaper.  It depends if she made a will out.  My grandmother, I swear to God, to go to the corner store an hour and a half with the  way she walks.  I'm waiting for that in an emergency situation.  Yeah, Grandma, come here.  No, get in the car.  Grandma.  OK.  No, I'll put the seat for you.  See the mushroom cloud, Grandma?  You know what I mean?  Grandma dies.  I'm sorry.  Love the woman, but Grandma dies. 
[02:09:00]  Who else?  What about the girlfriend?  What about the wife or the guman?  All right, you need that.  You need that in the post-apocalyptic world.  I don't plan on spanking until I die of radiation poisoning.  Is there a way to just save the hole?  There is line of the day.  Is there a way to just save the hole?  Whatever that means.  Don't dump me.  I don't even know what that means.  That's a sequel.  That is fantastic.  So it has like how you can now hook up with your loved ones. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, it's a pre-plan.  You get your network together.  You sit around.  Is it going to be just you and your media family?  Or are you going to go with the extended family, friends, whatever, whether we're two or 20 people?  Where do you suggest you go?  Depending on a different type of attack or something?  Yeah, absolutely.  Fall back.  This would be a meeting place, let's say.  OK.  Say this whole crew is here.  Who is the most level-headed?  Who is the Captain Kirk of the crew?  Stinky.  OK, we're stinky.  We would all end up in the stairwell smoking pot if it was up to stinky. 
[02:10:00]  He's getting high right now.  Stinky's the level-headed one.  And he makes the command decision whether we bunker down in here, we have our water, our dry goods, all of that.  Yeah.  Or we get in the minivan and we head out of town.  I'd head out of town.  With stinky?  Yeah.  Or stalker?  Stalker Patty.  Stalker Patty.  Just the hole.  I'd leave with a hole.  Rick's plan wouldn't work.  Everybody take off your pants and suck.  No one will tell.  The air's purified. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, Earl, our own Earl over here.  He is the assistant.  What the hell?  We're all going to die?  Earl's looking like Ernie Shavers.  He's the assistant fire marshal or something.  For the floor.  For the floor.  So last time we had a fire drill, no one could find Earl.  He was out on the street while all of us were left behind.  So I don't think we would want him in our little team.  Yeah, I would check his pockets for everybody's wallets.  Go look at it, Earl.  So now, let's say, let's say all of a sudden.  Look at a cop, an ex-com making fun of a black guy.  He's black? 
[02:11:00]  I wouldn't know that.  No, he's not.  He just wears all black.  Where's the tanning bed?  Why is Earl sweating so much?  You all right, Earl?  Let's say.  It's not like he has a plunger or anything.  Let's say.  Oh, I'm just going to go out on a limb.  There's a cataclysmic event in Manhattan.  Oh, damn.  All right.  Well, what are we talking about?  Are we talking about a nuclear weapon?  I'm talking.  Yeah.  There's a low-level nuclear attack in Manhattan.  What do you do?  You go to Bloomy's.  You buy some, what is it, lipstick?  And kiss your butt goodbye.  Kiss your ass goodbye.  Yeah, that's pretty much it.  Yeah, I noticed.  I read your nuclear part of this. 
[02:11:30]  It really doesn't say what to do.  It just says, hey, here's what it's all about.  You go to the Spice Channel.  That's about it.  Now, what about this anthrax thing?  What can we do?  Anthrax, well, you've got a better shot at, honestly, hitting Lotto twice than contracting anthrax.  I don't want to go and make people paranoid.  You've got to be in it to win it, though.  Yeah.  Or pick your mail up.  No, I wouldn't.  I don't want to make people paranoid.  I want to make them prepared.  And that's what this goes to.  Because many times, these things hit the fan, and you don't know where to go.  You're running like Fred Flintstone, not going anywhere, running in place.  I love that. 
[02:12:00]  And that's what this goes to.  Or when he just keeps running in the same window and picture and couch go by.  Yeah, like the deer in the headlights.  What is that?  A lot of people see that cloud coming, turn tail and head out of Dodge.  So you're saying just relax about the anthrax thing.  No big deal.  Yeah, well, you know, let's be aware.  Like, you guys, obviously, you're in higher profile.  You are in a media business.  What do you mean?  I wouldn't be opening up every letter.  We haven't touched our mail in weeks.  We let Stalker Patty open all our mail.  A taste of food, I see.  Yeah.  No, for the guy that works at the Dunkin' Donuts, you know, that white powder is either sugar or, if he's a drug addict, something else. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah.  I wouldn't count on anthrax.  Right.  Don't go crazy.  Right.  And it's just a checklist of things to go through until you die.  Yeah, be aware, be calm.  Right.  There are various places to write.  Contacts, doctors, hospitals, family contact list, poison centers.  Common sense.  Absolutely.  So this is all the info you should have at hand just in case.  Yeah.  You put it in your inside pocket.  You know, you keep it with your, uh, your zaggates, you know, in case something happens.  You don't want to get on that cell phone and come up with empty air.  You want to know where you're going to go. 
[02:13:00]  You want to know how to pick up your kid.  And you want to know the directions of where you're going to go.  Blank will pick up the children.  Yeah.  Blank will pick up the elderly, which is just off my list.  Pick up pets?  Nah.  You know something?  Thank you, Rover.  You've, you've been great.  The canary.  Yeah, yeah.  But, but you're dying.  Well, look at the last page.  I'm digging, I'm digging the last page of that book.  The last page?  Yeah.  The acknowledgements or the picture?  No, the picture.  There we go.  Oh, look at you.  There we go.  Look at him.  He's all badass in his picture.  Wearing black leather and stuff.  Well, where can people get, uh, the anti-terror checklist? 
[02:13:30]  Amazon.com, all major bookstores.  And it's just, you know, once again, it's a way to empower you.  You know, be forewarned as forearmed.  Here you go.  Is there a chapter in there dealing with, uh, finding anyone with foreskin and a hyphen  in their last name and booting them out of the effing country?  Yeah, it's called the button.  Hey, uh, Patty's ready to get her head shaved.  Well, there it is.  Pick up the anti-terror checklist.  Be prepared, Bill Stanton.  Oh, he can hang.  We'll get back a little bit.  Oh, yeah, he's hanging out. 
[02:14:00]  Thank you, boys.  I just want to make sure people know where to get it.  It's a good plug-in.  Beautiful.  Patty, you ready?  Do we have the digital camera?  Soccer Patty's getting, uh, her head completely shaved.  Oh, I got to see some of this.  Let me move a little.  There we go.  Hi, Patty.  How are you?  Ron and Fez were on after us.  They did this same bit.  Oh, yeah.  They, uh, shaved Al Duke's head because he lost playing a bet, uh, playing a game with  Earl, Rock and Roll Jeopardy, who you just do not challenge Earl to Rock and Roll Jeopardy. 
[02:14:30]  Right.  Earl knows nothing, but he knows everything about Rock and Roll.  So Ron and Fez did this.  They're on after us here in New York, and they do a great job.  Uh, Paul brought in the wig that Patty will have to wear for the next, uh, couple weeks.  Three months, maybe.  And, um, Earl is always the person we go to around here at this station to shave heads.  Right.  Uh, now first, what are we going to do?  We got scissors.  Well, we...  So first, we're just going to cut huge chunks of Patty's hair off of her head. 
[02:15:00]  Much to everyone's pleasure here.  Ben, calm down.  Damn, I taught you well, bro.  That's with the Harry Krishna thing.  Yeah, we're doing the Harry Krishna thing.  So, uh, Rick's making a little Harry...  Oh, you're making the Harry Krishna ponytail.  Make sure it's centered, uh, Rick.  You do that perfectly, Rick, by the way.  There you go.  You're kind of good with hair ever since this past weekend.  Hairstyling and whatnot.  I stumbled into Barbizon.  I stumbled in, and all of a sudden, I'm doing hair.  I don't know.  I accidentally went into a place, what a weird name, The Ramrod. 
[02:15:30]  And, uh, how was I to know?  I thought it was a place plumbers went to or something.  So, Patty's good.  Are you psyched, Patty?  A little nervous.  Why?  Well, what's it to be nervous about?  Why are you nervous?  Yeah, you see.  Oh, you get the tickets.  Cool.  Why are you nervous?  What's the matter, Patty?  Patty, I've got to ask you this also.  Before we cut any hair off your head, are you going to cry because of this?  No.  You're not going to cry?  I'll just hide onto my wig for three months. 
[02:16:00]  Oh, my God.  It takes three months to grow back.  Well, three months.  Three months.  Six months.  Not three months.  We'll give you something.  It'll look like a short haircut in three months.  I told you before, there's this stuff you put on your head and water it.  P-p-p-pattie.  P-p-p-pattie.  I don't know if I can water this.  You are so full of crap.  You're the sadistic son of a bitch here.  Okay, she has the little ponytail thing on her head, right? 
[02:16:30]  Who is going to start the cutting?  Ben.  Just somebody who knows what they're doing.  Hey, Patty, with this type of cut, it don't matter.  Ben does.  He's fine.  He needs to cut hair.  Until he stumbles into alcoholism.  I have a towel to put around her.  Oh, yeah, get something to put around her so the hair doesn't get all bloody and mingle  with the hair that's growing out of her body.  Might mix it up.  Do we have a sheet or something we could drape around, Patty? 
[02:17:00]  Put something over her head.  Yeah, let me, let's go to Jim real fast.  Jim, what's up?  Guys, you can't do this to her, man.  She's going to commit suicide when you're done.  Shut up.  You're going to ruin it.  She'll be fine.  You can't.  That's okay.  Oh, man, you guys have done so much to this poor girl.  Now you're going to do this?  She loves it.  I know she loves the abuse, but later on she's going to hate herself.  Hey, let me look in the mirror.  Oh, my God.  Well, you guys can live with yourself when you're done with this one. 
[02:17:30]  Hey, can we give her different haircuts on the way down to nothing?  Because a lot of people are asking for the mullet.  The Mr. T.  What about the mullet?  Okay, we can start with the mullet.  We've got to do it right so we're able to get them all.  Hold on, hold on.  Before you cut anything, start with the mullet, which will be the short in the front.  Wait, wait, wait.  No, no.  No, no.  Then you're ready to cut off the back part of the mullet.  No. 
[02:18:00]  All right, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Are we ready to begin?  Yeah, we're fine.  Yeah, we're ready.  Rick, Rick, short in the front, long in the back is the mullet.  We will start with the mullet, and then we will take a picture of Patty with a mullet.  And if this ain't a real mullet, I'm going to be pissed.  So do a good job.  Hold on.  I want to make Patty your set, right?  Yeah.  When I first met Earl, he had a nap.  Oh, my God.  And that was back in the back.  All right.  That's fascinating.  Am I right, Earl?  You did.  You had hair.  All right.  Try to resist the temptation to plunge the scissors through our eyeballs, too, guys. 
[02:18:30]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Come on.  That was cutter.  No.  I don't want to get hurt.  All right.  Wait, wait, wait.  Okay.  Short in the front, right?  Yeah.  On the side.  Make sure you leave that mullet.  The front and the side have to be short, but leave it long as it is in the back.  Oh, Ben just cut.  Ben just cut a huge chunk off.  All right, Rick.  It's your turn.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  Watch the ears.  You guys are going to hell for this. 
[02:19:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Leave enough for the back.  There you go, Rick.  Now cut the ass off.  Oh, my God.  It looks like Billy Ray Cyrus.  Oh, no.  All right.  Well, Patty's getting more.  Looking more and more like a mullet.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Rick's really doing it good because he's cutting it that straight across right above the ear  all the way to the mullet in the back.  Oh, that is fantastic. 
[02:19:30]  Rick, get on the other side.  Get on the other side.  Yeah.  Look, look.  That's great, Rick.  You know that mullet.  Can we have more incompetent people doing this?  Watch her ears.  Don't cut her ears off.  Don't cut the tip of her ear.  And Stinky's on the other side of the mullet.  Stinky, you might want to look around and see what Rick's doing.  See?  The mullet.  And then cut it accordingly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right.  Oh, the mullet just rocks.  Hockey hair.  Oh, my God.  It is such a huge hairstyle in upstate New York, the mullet. 
[02:20:00]  That's true.  People love it.  All right.  Turn around, Patty.  Patty, let me see how you're doing with the mullet so far.  Let me see the other side.  Turn around.  Turn around.  No, Patty, put your hands down.  Patty, put your hands down.  Turn around.  No, no.  Oh, yeah.  Beautiful.  Sure.  Guys, you've got to go up higher above the ears with the mullet.  And the front, see that bang?  Rick, Rick, see the bang hanging over that eye?  Just ace that.  Get rid of those bangs.  Yeah, the bangs are a little too... 
[02:20:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, what are you snipping off a little bit for?  All of it.  Rick, that's got to go.  Short in the front.  To the skull.  Business in front, long in the back.  Give her the mullet.  All right, Ann, why don't we...  You mean lesbian mullet?  Yeah.  We really have to take a break.  Oh, jeez, look at this.  Oh, yeah.  What are you doing now?  All right, that's good enough.  That's good enough.  That's good.  Holy ass.  Oh, my God.  Patty has no bangs.  Anthony's on the floor.  Oh, my God. 
[02:21:00]  Patty, it looks good.  You look like it.  How's it going?  She looks like a 31-year-old guy from Ronconca.  The ship from The Three Stooges.  That is a beautiful start to a mullet.  All right.  And you've got to give it spiky on top.  All right.  All right.  That's beautiful, Rick.  She kind of looks like Joe Dirt.  God damn.  All right, listen.  Oh, my God.  We really should take a break.  Yeah, okay.  All right, when we come back, the mullet should be complete.  Rick, you're going to get pictures of this for the website, right? 
[02:21:30]  Yep.  Okay.  Patty, getting her hair cut.  Well, all of it.  All of it.  All her hair will be gone before the show is over.  But we got her a wig, so she's going to wear that.  Yeah, the mullet's looking good.  Rick's got some good, uh...  I need new hair.  I got new hair.  I'm a regular good man.  I'm not a crackpot old bean.  All right, we'll be back with Patty's haircut.  Some days, you know, we're a laugh riot.  And other days, we just flat out suck.  We know it.  It's interesting and true. 
[02:22:00]  Opie and Anthony.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Stalker Patty has a mullet.  Yeah, Patty now has the mullet.  We, uh...  We decided...  We had some U2 tickets.  And, um...  Patty loves U2.  Loves the...  So we decided we were going to give her a couple of U2 tickets.  And, uh...  Since last time, she had to earn the tickets  by having Ron Jeremy's big hammy hand down by her, uh... 
[02:22:30]  Vitals.  Most intimate of areas, yeah.  Yeah.  Uh...  This time, we decided she would be able to go to U2  if she cut off all her hair,  except for a small Hare Krishna ponytail  right at the crown...  That's right.  ...of her head.  And Rick's been taking pictures as he goes.  Yeah.  And, uh...  Patty has not seen herself, uh...  with the mullet hairdo.  Well, I think, uh...  I think there's a little music  that might let her know, uh...  what she looks like  before she even, uh...  looks. 
[02:23:00]  You know this song, Patty?  From a movie.  You know a movie?  Tom Hanks?  Yes.  Philadelphia!  Streets of Philadelphia.  Blue Springsteen.  Yes, man.  Yeah, there you go.  You kind of look like Tom Hanks in Philadelphia.  I was bruised and battered at me  Until what I felt I was 
[02:23:30]  Unrecognized  You love this song?  Well, it sure means a lot now.  That's right.  We can't play the whole song.  We're running out of showtime.  There's also, um...  If you remember a movie  that was on,  it was called  Playing for Time.  It had Vanessa Redgrave  as a holocaust, uh...  someone in a concentration camp.  And you really resemble  Vanessa Redgrave.  Well, in that movie.  All right, why don't we give  Patty a mirror  so she can check out  the mullet live on the show here.  Now, Patty, 
[02:24:00]  there's no backing out now  because, uh...  it would be really bad.  Look at it from the side.  It looks like,  You bloody baboon!  You've cut out his brain!  Rick handing her the mirror.  Damn you!  Here we go.  Look, Patty, what do you think?  Interesting.  Okay.  Interesting.  All right.  All right, let's go to the...  There she is with her mullet.  We've gotten pictures.  Uh, Earl is panicking  because he needs to start  shaving now  or we're gonna run out of show.  All right, uh, just... 
[02:24:30]  The Mohawk.  Go the Mohawk really quick.  That means...  Just cut all that off.  Let Earl get there  with the...  Oh, my God.  Don't do it rough.  Now, be gentle, Rick.  Be gentle.  Look at that big chunk of hair.  He is squeezing the scissors  so hard  and he can't get through it.  What are you...  Wow, do you hear that?  Get a mic by there.  You can actually hear it riffing.  It's got the consistency  of brundle fly hair.  Brundle fly reference. 
[02:25:00]  Always good.  Ooh, that was a big chunk, huh?  Hey, uh...  Earl, why don't you  start shaving the sides?  That's short enough.  All right?  All right, all three, uh...  Yeah, can't you just shave it  like in the military  where all that long hair  will just fly off?  Give her the Mohawk, Earl.  You know what the Mohawk is, right?  You're part Indian.  Right?  I heard that.  Come on, Earl.  We're running out of show.  So, there you go.  Some tribe in the Bronx.  I don't know.  He says he's Indian. 
[02:25:30]  All right, there's the razor.  Here we go.  Give her the Mohawk, Earl.  They're not going to hurt, Patty.  Relax.  Be gentle.  You want to put a hair on eBay?  Patty, you don't have  any Gorbachev, uh...  big wine stains  under there, do you?  Three sixes.  Or any skull warts?  You don't have any skull warts  that might be torn off.  No?  Any unusual dents on your head  when your parents dropped you  not accidentally?  Hoping for the best?  A 666, perhaps?  How great would that be?  A nice festering skull warts. 
[02:26:00]  There's a lot of people out there looking.  There's a lot of people.  Yeah, you're a star once again.  You like this stuff.  How's it coming off, Earl?  Pretty easy.  Pretty easy?  It's fine hair, right?  Yeah.  Not like that manly hair  that you're used to shaving.  There you go.  It's coming off good.  How are you feeling, Patty?  Okay?  All right.  The whole right side  of Patty's head is...  Wow.  God, it just...  I so wanted...  I see her head like that.  I want to do a lobotomy on her  so bad.  She looks like Johnny Rotten. 
[02:26:30]  Without the Johnny.  Patty Rotten.  Hey, Rick, you've got to get  a picture of this side  that's completely shaved.  I like the mohawk look there.  Yes.  Pity the poor fool  that messes with me.  Anthony, by the way,  the boobo lantern contest  is still on.  No girls showed up today,  but a few called  and said they would be here tomorrow.  That's good.  If you get down here  by tomorrow, ladies,  for the boobo lantern contest,  you'll be in the drawing  for the U2 tickets  between the other contestants.  Right.  We're going to do this  all week long, though,  so if you can't make it  down tomorrow,  show up Thursday or Friday. 
[02:27:00]  Also doing it in Boston,  Monday and Tuesday  when we broadcast live  from WBCN.  Basically, we're looking  for girls with breast implants.  We put flashlights  under the breast implants  and in a dark room  they light up  like jack-o'-lanterns.  So that's what we're  going to be doing  the rest of the week  and Monday and Tuesday  of next week, okay?  Hey, Earl, you've got to leave  some for the mohawk on top.  What are you doing?  Earl, what are you doing?  You were taking the top off,  weren't you?  All right.  That's still...  What a surprise.  Earl screwed it up.  Earl, it's a friggin' haircut. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah, don't get him pissed  with that in his hand, okay?  Oh, what's he going to do?  Booglander and Anthony,  the prizes,  third place tickets  to see Aerosmith  in either New York,  Boston, or Philly.  Nice.  Earl!  What did he do?  You can't do a mohawk  without a front.  Earl, what are you doing?  Don't you know  what a mohawk is?  Tell me, go, go, go.  No, don't go there.  I only know what an afro is.  Rick, do you...  Earl, Jesus.  Do you know what an...  We can't do anything  right on this show.  Do you know what a mohawk is?  Yes.  What is it? 
[02:28:00]  But he's guiding me.  What is it?  You were going to go, go, go,  and I'm going.  He said,  where are you going there?  I was like,  you're telling me to go there?  You got some...  Go, you idiot.  Cut by the ears.  You got some by the ears there,  by those...  Just keep cutting.  All right, Anthony,  second place for the  Boovalantern Contest,  DVD player from Samsung  and a Boogeyman DVD.  And first place,  of course,  $1,000 cash.  Cash.  So ladies with the breast implants,  you got to get your butts down here  while we broadcast  from 3 to 7  sometime this week.  And if you come down...  Or for the Boston Ladies  Monday and Tuesday of next week.  And if you come down tomorrow, 
[02:28:30]  you get put in a chance  to win U2 tickets.  Yeah.  Is that true?  Extra incentive.  Very good.  And third place is  you win one of Patty's ears  to go tobogganing in.  Oh, jeez.  Wow.  That is amazing.  All right,  can we give Patty a mirror again?  See how the...  It's going for her.  No, no one wants  to give her the mirror.  Patty, take a look.  Take a look at how  it looks so far.  Looks great, Patty.  It's getting there  slowly to sure.  I kind of like it.  If she couldn't win  a Squeaky Fromm  Lookalike Contest... 
[02:29:00]  Yes.  No one could.  Yes.  Do you know  a Squeaky Frommage?  What's wrong, Patty?  It's gone.  It is gone.  What do you expect?  Now it matches  the inside of her head.  Can we shave your eyebrows  while we're at it?  The eyebrows have to come off  because that's part  of the Harry Christian look.  They have to.  They have to.  It's part of the  Harry Christian look.  Harry Christian...  Yeah, no,  not the eyelashes.  Patty, what do you think so far?  What do you think, Patty?  Leave enough  that it'll grow back.  Oh, well...  Leave enough  that it'll grow back? 
[02:29:30]  What do you think?  If you cut it all off  it never grows back?  Her hair is shorter  than Norton's.  Do you have the urge  to assassinate  Gerald Ford?  Yeah, look at her.  She looks like  Squeaky Fromm.  One of Manson's...  Can we carve  a swastika  in your forehead?  Red rum.  That's beautiful.  The eyebrows  got to go, though.  Jeff from D.C.  is calling in  and goes,  Guys, watch out  for Patty's antennas.  Yes, we're being  very careful.  Yeah, because  if you take  an ant's antenna off  they're pretty much useless  and the rest of the  colony will eat them. 
[02:30:00]  Earl, how are we doing?  Good?  Good?  Earl?  That's looking good.  It's coming off  nice and easy.  All right.  It's like Rocky VI.  Talia Shire  goes in for chemo.  Oh!  Look at that  baldy head  she's sporting there.  You're talking to me?  You're talking to me?  All right.  They're really working  at this.  Two scissors out,  a razor.  A lot of people  will ask you  where are the  Stalker Patty photos? 
[02:30:30]  They'll be up  later tonight, hopefully.  Yeah, they'll be up.  Go to opiananthony.com  or foundrymusic.com.  Steve's rolling  video in here.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y  music.com.  foundrymusic.com.  Um, did you get  her face right  when she looked  at herself the last time?  Because she really  looked surprised.  Ronnie and Fez are  coming in.  Come in then.  Oh, no.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  You know.  Let's in New York.  We, uh,  yeah, we heard 
[02:31:00]  your show there  on Friday.  You had Al Dukes  getting his head shaved.  And now apparently  you have his sister.  Well, she's a big  U2 fan and, uh,  this is what,  so she wants to look  like the edge?  Yeah.  I'd love it.  I'd want to look  like the edge.  Hey, she looks like  the lead singer  from Bow Wow Wow.  Nice.  Oh, please.  She wants candy.  She wants candy.  She was hot.  You've got to be  careful with this  if you've never  shaved somebody's head  before because the 
[02:31:30]  scalp is very tender.  Yeah.  So we've got a hair gel  to run up into the scalp.  What is that?  It's a hair gel, Patty.  It's a nice hair gel.  It's called  Sudden Death Sauce.  And it's the only thing  that'll close up the scalp  if there's any nicks in it.  It's good for your follicles.  That is great.  So we're going to make her  into a Harry Kushner.  She's going to be  a Harry Kushner.  She's so sickly looking.  How did you... 
[02:32:00]  I mean, nice way.  In a nice...  In a cute way.  In a cute way.  So she can hear us  from here then.  Isn't it in a cute way?  Okay.  It's kind of...  That would be what...  It's kind of in a  make sure you wet  the sponge kind of way.  Isn't that...  You know, isn't she cute  in that way?  How did her head  get so flat?  I don't know.  It's like a flounder  would have a wider face.  There's two eyes  on one side of her head.  I don't get it.  They migrate right through. 
[02:32:30]  Ronnie.  Yeah.  Pick up the wig  in front of you.  That's what she...  She decided  she's going to wear  a wig now.  So we had to get her  a wig.  So we got her  that little...  It's a little flip.  It's a that girl  flip thing.  It's a that girl wig.  I like it.  It's a that girl wig.  It's that girl  meets bad girl.  It's going to be nice for her.  Yeah, yeah.  It's going to look lovely.  I've never seen anybody  look like this  unless hospice was around them.  It reminds you  of like your grandmother  when you leave the room  and you just lean  against the wall 
[02:33:00]  and you're crying.  It's not even her anymore.  It's not her anymore.  Wow.  Unless you're Opie  you say I'll wait out  in the car.  Oh.  Mom, I'll be in the car.  You gotta go in.  Mom, I'll be in the car.  You gotta go in.  Oh, you can't go in.  Well, so we don't kill  Ron and Fez  with 20 minutes of commercials.  We're going to take  a quick break.  Okay.  And then we're going  to end the show  with hopefully  the final product  of Stalker Patty's haircut.  Okay?  I think with this haircut  she'll be able  to go to space camp  for free. 
[02:33:30]  Don't you think  they'll let me?  Make a wish.  Really?  We could get her  backstage and meet Bono.  Yeah, probably.  Yeah.  That's like Vanessa Redgrave  accepting the Oscar.  Yeah.  We'll be back  in a few minutes  with Ron and Fez.  We're on after us  in New York.  You better be listening.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's like listening  to Corky and Cara Ann Quinlan.  Opie and Anthony.  I'd rather hear  my penis in a vice  than listen to those jokes.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:34:00]  And we're back  with the O&A Show.  In the studio,  Ron and Fez.  They're on after us  here in New York.  We love these guys.  Thank you for bringing us  in to see Tank Girl.  We just got pictures  of Patty  with the mohawk too,  Anthony.  Yeah.  And now they're  finishing the haircut  making her look  like a Harry Krishna.  Yeah.  We don't know  where the wig went  though, Patty.  Oh.  She's staring at the wig.  Fez, you try the wig 
[02:34:30]  on just for a second.  Drop the wig  in the toilet bowl.  I want to cut  the wig so bad.  There you go.  Oh, this is going  to look good on you.  Wow.  Fezzy, that's nice.  Get a picture of Fezzy  with Tiger Patty's wig.  It's like the nice  That Girl wig on.  Scott Muni used to  dress up like that  in 64 when the  Beetlewigs were big.  Yeah, it's kind of  a Beetlewig almost  with a little flip to it.  Yeah.  Fez thinks he is  his mother.  Look at that wig. 
[02:35:00]  Mother blood.  And Patty's haircut  just about done  for the U2 tickets.  Almost.  Then we're going  to what?  Take a picture  of the Hare Krishna  look.  Yes.  That she's got  sporting there.  Yeah.  You guys almost done?  Yeah.  I'm hoping this is  almost done.  Then we could have  her put the wig on  and see what she's  going to look like  for the next six years  of her life.  And fortunately,  she can do a comb  over with her eyebrows.  That's me.  Oh, that's hot. 
[02:35:30]  Hey, you've gone  too far.  Come on.  I want to cut the wig.  Yeah, you got bangs.  Oh, man.  There you go.  All right.  Oh, God.  I think we're just  about done, huh?  Please drag her  through the studio  like that.  Oh, my God.  What are you brushing?  There's nothing  left there.  They're brushing hair  that's not  addressed to her body  anymore.  It's the Karen  Silkwood shower.  He's just rubbing  her with a hard  wire brush. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, my God.  Another great reference.  Penny Ball  Chick movie.  That's it.  Right.  They all work.  Sigourney Weaver.  She's there.  Right there.  This is...  Hey, Rick,  were you almost done  or what?  We're good.  We're good to go?  All right.  Oh, man.  Wait, did you miss  a spot on track?  I think it looks great.  All right.  Doesn't it look good?  She's got a new  little look for herself  there.  Brush that off of her  neck if it's not attached.  Put my shades on.  You look like K-Pax. 
[02:36:30]  It's going to look  nice on you.  That's nice on you.  There you go.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Patty, you could probably  get some guys like that.  Ones that will beat you up.  There you are.  I bet Jodie Foster  will love you now.  Finally.  Patty, don't you just  want to punch a Jew  right now?  Oh, man.  She goes to have  a skinhead look to her.  Why are there so many  colors in our country?  Where are my Doc Martens? 
[02:37:00]  I'm going to go out  and tell those mud babies  to stay out of our country.  Could someone carve a  swiss sticker in my forehead?  I'm going to go try to  shoot Gerald Ford again.  It's Nazi Patty.  Run.  It's Nazi Patty.  Nazi Patty.  Has Patty seen what  she looks like?  Not yet.  Why don't we give her a mirror?  Did she know her ears  are pointed?  That's great.  Yeah, she looks like  the Vulcan from  Star Trek II.  What do you think, Patty? 
[02:37:30]  It'll probably look good  when it grows in.  Oh, yeah.  You can hope for that.  That's seriously  what happens.  Oh, the new  Schindler called  You're on the list!  Yay!  You're on the list!  Squeaky from  right here.  Patty, why don't you  put the wig on  so you can show  everybody what you're  going to look like  for the next thing?  Here it comes.  Yeah, it's prettier  with your regular glasses  on top.  Oh, that's good.  Yeah.  That's great.  Thank you.  Just keep working. 
[02:38:00]  If you keep working,  they will not kill you.  I'm essential  to the war effort.  Oh, man.  She looks like  Bill Murray's  friend in stripes.  I can't believe  you did that.  Okay, this is  the way she'll be working.  Oh, my God.  I've got a little bit.  That's good.  Patty, yeah,  it's got to be brushed.  You've got to make sure  that part's in the right place.  That's perfect.  Lois Lane on chemo.  Super Clark, 
[02:38:30]  Lois is very,  very sick.  We're doing  everything we can.  Great Caesar's  ghost lane.  What happened?  Oh, my God.  I hope the wind  doesn't flow  with walking something.  No, no.  That probably won't happen.  Well, what do you think,  Patty,  of your wig there?  That is amazing.  You are going to get  so many people  feeling sorry for you. 
[02:39:00]  for sure.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, it looks good.  It looks good.  Maybe we could get  other wigs for her to wear.  Like, every so often  she can pop down,  we'll pop another wig  on her head.  I want the multicolored  afro.  You want that for the  Yankee game?  Patty,  the big multicolored  afro sport fan guy?  Patty 316.  We'll try to find her  at the Yankees games.  We'll get her  Yankees tickets  every night.  And people have to  pick her out of the crowd.  Spot Patty.  Patty, I want to make sure  you leave here happy.  Are you all right? 
[02:39:30]  With the new look  and the new wig and all?  Yeah.  And you're going to U2.  It'll grow back.  Yeah, that's true.  It'll grow back.  Yeah, eventually.  Did we get a picture  of Patty with her wig on?  I got 50 bucks  says it never grows back.  You don't think so?  No.  Yeah.  That scalp is dead.  That's happened before Patty,  you know.  They call my name Patty.  Yeah.  That women shave off  their head  and it doesn't grow back.  Oh, that's not true, though.  Yeah, just take some  Propecia.  Yeah.  I don't have that.  Putting air on it. 
[02:40:00]  Nah.  A lot of vitamins  and stuff.  Royal jelly.  Ah, well, that royal jelly.  That'll do it.  That's nutrients.  It's called her  the corpse of Jackie Kennedy.  Like, we just exhumed  Jackie Kennedy,  doesn't she?  It's a perfect look.  We've opened the coffin.  That is a great costume  for you to go as.  The dead Jackie O.  Isn't that great?  No, I'm good.  I have that other one 
[02:40:30]  in the...  Put some blood on yourself  like Kennedy.  Kennedy Kennedy.  All right, well,  why don't we pull the wig off  so we can laugh...  I mean, so we can see...  Yeah.  No, just so we can see,  you know, the shaved head again.  There you go.  Let me say it again.  Oh, my God.  You're bald!  That's something, man.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  You cut out her brain!  Those awful thin lips.  You ever see communion?  No.  Yes!  Yes! 
[02:41:00]  Wow, good reference.  Oh, she's putting that wig back on.  You like that wig?  Put it on backwards.  Put the wig on backwards  just for a second.  You think it's going to matter?  They're right.  Patty, you are going to have to  fix that wig a little bit  before you go out in public with that.  You just...  People are going to look at you  a little funny.  But that'll be nice.  Your hair's nice for the summer.  You've got that off your neck now.  Yeah, yeah.  Nice and cooler.  Nice and cool for the summer.  Or if you have to star an enemy mind.  At the time the summer comes  all the hair again.  Well, you think so. 
[02:41:30]  All right.  Well, should we cut off  the Harry Kushner ponytail now  or are we going to keep that?  When do we get the Harry Kushner  going here?  I'd cut it off.  Why don't we cut that off?  Shave that off.  Get all that hair off her hair.  A little more Tyra's bull buff.  Could you yank it out?  Because she's got...  You know why?  She's got these straight...  Wait, you've got to get a picture of that.  You've got to get a picture of that.  Because she's got these  stray hairs, too.  Patty, why is she...  Samurai Patty.  You're not going to cry in this,  are you?  No.  Darn.  I mean, that's good. 
[02:42:00]  That is great.  You should leave the hair.  Hey, it looks like someone  beat the hell out of  I Dream of Jeannie.  You're right.  Patty, it doesn't look that bad.  I Dream of Dummy.  That's great.  And with those round glasses,  you look like...  Get Earl's head next to her  so we can see if the black  and white bald people  could one day live as one.  You know what?  With the ground glasses  and the bald head,  doesn't it look like  she's going to hop in a zero  and aim for one of our battleships? 
[02:42:30]  All right,  why don't we shave the ponytail?  Yeah, shave that off.  I'm going to miss that.  Darn, well, yeah,  I kind of grew accustomed to it.  Yeah.  Snip.  Oh, boy.  Oh, that was a mistake.  That was a huge mistake.  She looks stupid now.  How dishonorable. 
[02:43:00]  Now she can't go back  to her village.  I know.  You cut that thing off,  it's over.  She can't go to heaven now.  You look like Donald Pleasance  with Lou Gehrig's disease.  Oh, she's glaring.  Now she's glaring.  Yeah.  What's wrong, Patty?  Get all those stray hairs off.  What's wrong?  Oh, nothing.  Those strays made it look like  those old dogs  at your relative's house  that just have a few  and they smell.  She's just upset  because Hoss and Little Joe  want dinner right away.  Come on, Hoss. 
[02:43:30]  Dang.  All came is a con right.  I am hungry.  I could go for some Paisanos.  Talk that jink  a day's pay  for napping on the job.  You know,  I'm sure if you go down  to Paisanos tonight,  Joey will give you  a free meal.  Yeah.  Definitely.  In the alley.  Definitely.  He can't have her in.  No, you can't have her  sitting in your restaurant.  Tell Joey we sent you, Patty.  Okay.  There's some listeners  in the area  and they want to see  Patty's new look.  Sure, go down to Paisanos  on Mulberry Street tonight.  That's looking good. 
[02:44:00]  She's got the mighty fine  little thing going up  of a very nicely shaped head.  Why don't we hand Patty  her U2 tickets?  She deserved them today.  There you go.  You're going to U2 again, Patty.  Oh, wait.  That's UB-40.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  It's a U.  It's a U.  It's a U.  And Earl,  if they ever shoot  Coming to America,  you're going to be  in the barbershop scene.  Yeah.  That's right.  Isn't he good?  He's like the barber.  Yes, sir.  Rocky Basiano, 
[02:44:30]  that's all white people  want to talk about.  The man's named Clay.  I'm going to call him Clay.  Did we get a final picture  of Patty?  There we go.  All these pictures  will be up on  opiananthony.com  and foundrymusic.com  later on tonight.  Be quiet.  They will hear you.  All right.  I think we did  a pretty good show today, Ant.  Yeah.  Bang up.  The bang up program.  The great 
[02:45:00]  boobal lantern contest  continues tomorrow.  Hopefully, ladies  will show up for that  tomorrow.  All right.  Very cool.  You want to give out  some tickets to the  Grave Rave?  Yeah, we're going to be  up in Boston  Monday and Tuesday  next week.  And we can't wait.  We're hosting their  Grave Rave  with the Crystal Method,  Anthony.

So, Boston ladies  with boob implants,  make sure you show up  at the station  so we can put  flashlights under them 
[02:45:30]  and make them glow, okay?  Can we do something  real quick?  Yeah, go ahead.  I hope so.  Get the flashlights.  Turn the lights out.  Put them on either side  of Patty's head.  I want to see  what it looks like.  I think our skull  might light up.  Can we do that?  Sure, we can.  How many of these  do we give away, Ben?  Let's do 10.  Put one on each  side of her head  and turn the lights out.  You've got to touch it, though.  Oh, that's the boobal lantern.  Okay, turn that out.  I can see myself  now in the mirror.  Yeah, it's pretty scary. 
[02:46:00]  Turn the other lights out.  There's no knob.  No knob.  Rick will find it.  There we go.  All right, listen.  We're going to go off the air.

[02:47:00]  opianthony.com  or foundrymusic.com  later on tonight.  Patty looking like  Darth Vader  in the end of  Return of the Jedi.  She's got the  Sigourney Weaver  look going, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  She has...  More than anything,  I think, huh?  What a thin head.  Yeah, it is.  Awful skull.  It's like a pinhead.  It's like an ant.  If we got antennas,  yeah, we gotta do that.  She would look  just like an ant.  We can't get a horse  to walk in here  and bite that head.  Like an apple.  A little skinny oat.  All right, we gotta get out of here. 
[02:47:30]  We'll do it again tomorrow,  three.  Thank you.  Hi, we're here.  We're here under your skin,  us two a-holes.  Hello!  Opie and Anthony.  Thank you.  We'll be right back. </pre>
