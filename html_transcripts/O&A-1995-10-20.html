<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

Opie and Anthony broadcast live from the soon-to-be-demolished Peter Pan bus terminal in downtown Boston.  The show heavily promoted their upcoming Halloween bash at the Roxy, giving away 50 pairs of tickets through various listener stunts.  These stunts included Mike Locks pulling a chain through his nose and out his mouth, and Brad Patton from Eureka, Missouri, deep-throating a large kielbasa.  The broadcast encouraged listeners driving on Atlantic Avenue to honk their horns in response to the show's presence.  Free hot dogs were provided by Belly Stuffers, and the hosts noted the presence of a coffin on the roof of the bus terminal.  Boston Ladder and Scaffolding received a shout-out for their assistance with the broadcast setup.  The show also mentioned other events, including a Red Hot Track Challenge with WAF's Kevin Barbary and the Hot Rock Angels.  The broadcast featured music from several bands including Faith No More, Our Lady Peace, Black No. 9, Smashing Pumpkins, and Candlebox throughout the show.

It's Opie and Anthony broadcasting live from the Peter Pan bus terminal in downtown Boston  on Atlantic Avenue.  We are definitely stopping traffic.  If you're driving by, honk your horn for us, please.  And one of the things we're doing this afternoon, we got 50 pairs of tickets for our big Halloween  bash at the Roxy next Sunday night.  That seems to be what the people want.  Also, wow. 
[00:02:30]  Also, Anthony, thank the hot dog dude.  Oh, yeah.  Belly Stuffers hot dogs.  He's serving up free hot dogs.  I'm on by right on Atlantic Avenue.  And you can't miss the place.  There's a huge coffin on the roof.  A WAF coffin on the roof.  And we got to thank Boston Ladder and Scaffolding.  Very good.  For helping us out.  And the reason we're at Peter Pan bus terminal this afternoon, this building is going to be  gone like next week.  And they're moving their location across the street.  So we're kind of celebrating, man.  Who do we got?  What's your name?  Mike Locks.  And Paul Macanello.  And you guys got a wacky trick you're going to do for tickets to our big Halloween bash. 
[00:03:00]  You guys want to see something demented or what?  Yeah!  All right.  Explain to the people listening at home what you're going to do.  I'm going to pull the chain through my nose and pull it out my mouth.  He's going to pull a chain through his nose and out his mouth.  All right, Mike, whenever you're ready.  I've never seen anyone sober do this.  He's going to...  There he goes.  He's snorting it up his nose.  Oh!  He has snorted half the chain in his nostril.  Does it come out of his butt? 
[00:03:30]  And he's...  Oh!  There you go.  He is flossing his nose and mouth.  He's flossing his brain.  His brain, basically.  Ah, show the crowd again.  You guys like that or what?  Yeah!  Oh, look it.  There's a little green charm on it now.  He might puke.  All right.  Should we give him tickets for the Halloween bash for doing that?  Yeah!  He gets our first pair of tickets.  If you're in the area, it's the Peter Pan bus terminal. 
[00:04:00]  Come on by and say hi.  Hopefully, we're going to have a keg here soon to make the party complete.  In the meantime, if you're on Atlantic Avenue, honk your horns.  There they are.  Cool.  And we're going to check out the latest from the Smashing Pumpkins.  It's bullet with butterfly wings.  It's always playing at first.  107.3 WAF.  The world is a van.  107.3 WAF.

And it didn't take long for this whole thing to turn very ugly.  Right.  Look at what we have this guy doing.  Well, here's the deal.  We got 50 pairs of tickets to our big Halloween bash at the Roxy.  And my pal here is going to deep throat a jumbo size Frank.  That isn't even a regular hot dog.  This thing looks like John Holmes. 
[00:05:00]  No, that's a kielbasa, bro.  All right.  Whenever you're ready, face the crowd, bro, and deep throat that sucker.  That's courtesy of Belly Stumper.  Wow.  That is so gross.  Look at him go.  Hey, done this before?  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, God. 
[00:05:30]  Too bad this is radio.  That's one of the sickest things I've ever seen in my life.  He's having much too good a time doing this, I think.  He obviously has done this.  Wow.  All right.  All right.  Enough already.  God, I'm going to puke.  What the hell are you trying to do?  Get a date?  What are you guys thinking now?  What are you thinking?  All right.  If you're in the area, come on down.  We are having an absolute riot.  Supposedly, there's a keg on the way.  We're broadcasting live from the Peter Pan Buster in downtown Boston on the only station
