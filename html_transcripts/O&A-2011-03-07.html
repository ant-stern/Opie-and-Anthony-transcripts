<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, largely revolving around a critical dissection of Charlie Sheen's "Sheen's Corner" Ustream show.  The hosts, Opie, Anthony Cumia, and Jim Norton (with Simon Rex present in the studio at one point),  consistently ridiculed Sheen's performance, describing it as "embarrassingly bad,"  "awkward," and rambling. They criticized the poor audio quality, overuse of catchphrases ("winning," "tiger blood"),  random sound effects, and lack of prepared content.  They compared it unfavorably to other low-budget productions like "PFG TV," and even to their own past podcasts.  Sheen's poem, "The Big White Phone," was read aloud and mocked.  The hosts speculated on Sheen's sobriety, his motivations, and the impact of his legal and personal circumstances on his online persona.  The conversation frequently included tangents, such as a listener's call about Salem's warlocks' reaction to Sheen's use of the term, and anecdotes about Brie Olsen's past explicit appearances on the show.  They even created a humorous "Gnarls-Gnarlington" list and discussed the possibility of a Mark Cuban reality show featuring Sheen.

The show also featured extensive discussions on unrelated topics.  These included a bizarre, sexually explicit discussion creating a baseball-style scoring system for gay sex; a host's dream about a deceased friend, focusing on the dream's seating arrangement and fear of contracting AIDS from dream-tears;  a phone interview with Johnny Knoxville (promoting *Jackass 3D*), detailing dangerous stunts and his involvement in *The Wild and Wonderful Whites of West Virginia*; and a phone interview with Matthew McConaughey, ribbing him about his movie poster poses.  The hosts also discussed *Red State*, John Goodman's career, a study about staring at breasts improving heart health, the calming effects (or lack thereof) of holding babies, and various reality TV shows, including *Secret Millionaire*, *Undercover Boss*, and shows featuring morbidly obese people.  They also discussed their difficulty engaging with television series, contrasting their preference for reality shows.  The death of a restaurant owner known for unhealthy food and the invention of buffalo chicken wings were briefly mentioned, as well as speculation about the main character of *Idiot Abroad* possibly having autism.  The hosts also addressed their views on the dominance of Islam, leading to a discussion of global religious demographics, which involved crude and offensive comments about various religions.

A significant portion of the broadcast involved Brie Olsen, both in pre-recorded segments and an in-studio appearance with Caden Cross.  These segments featured explicit discussions of their careers, personal experiences (including Olsen detailing past sexual experiences as a minor), and preferences in pornography.  Olsen's in-studio appearance involved sexually explicit jokes and innuendo, significant banter about physical attributes, and a playful segment attempting to identify the object of her alleged "crush" in the studio.  In-studio guests included Sam Roberts, E-Rock, Danny, Travis, Troy, D-Boy, Jimmy Norton, and Mark Maron. There was a prolonged discussion and playful teasing about a possible relationship between Olsen and Norton, culminating in Olsen removing her clothing, leaving her topless and in her underwear for a period of time while sitting on Norton's lap.  The hosts frequently made sexually suggestive comments regarding Olsen's body and fantasies. One segment graphically detailed a sexual encounter between Olsen and a male staff member, Earl, with the hosts and studio personnel providing crude commentary. This segment included descriptions of Earl's arousal and ejaculation, and frequently referenced race and interracial sex.  The broadcast also included repeated references to Anthony’s angry reaction to technical difficulties during his live stream parody of Sheen’s show, culminating in him pointing a gun at the camera; and announcements regarding planned segments, including future videos involving the adult film stars and the re-airing of the "Tree Fort Richard" segment.  The show concluded with promotion of upcoming appearances by Brie Olsen and Opie and Anthony, and mentions of sponsors.  There were also discussions about new Sirius XM policies that threatened a planned post-show segment with Brie Olsen.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Reg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up The Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment  and having very few limits.  Oh, my God. 
[00:00:30]  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny, and it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  You get the crazier, the better.  Yeah, yeah.  What, are you, 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show's on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go, fuck.  I have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime. 
[00:01:00]  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Uh, funny.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Show.  Sit back and enjoy the show.  Yeah, morning.  Morning.  Dudes.  Morning, dudes.  Oh, God.  Right.  Winning.  Winning.  Winning.  No.  Winning.  No, you're not.  Tiger Blood.  Winning.  No one cares.  Well, I mean, people still care, but there's a bit of a drop-off on Charlie Sheen. 
[00:01:30]  Duh.  They care, duh.  Duh.  A bit of a drop-off in the Sheen popularity.  I was, uh, I was asking last night, I was like, do you think he's going to do anything where  he comes back?  Because, like, he's gone through a few of these phases so far in this new incarnation of Charlie  Sheen, where you're like, all right, oh, that's cool.  Wow, Charlie Sheen, he's fucking cool as shit.  Charlie Sheen's an asshole.  Yeah.  Charlie Sheen, whoa, did you hear what he did?  He's fucking cool as shit.  Yeah.  And now he's in the asshole phase again, where everyone's like, oh, God, ugh. 
[00:02:00]  Don't you think this whole Charlie Sheen thing works because you think he might be on drugs  or might go back to drugs at any second?  That's part of the intrigue.  That's why I think the Ustream show he did on Saturday night sucked.  Oh, it was so bad.  Because most people were tuning in, because they don't follow it as closely as you and  I do, and certainly a bunch of our listeners.  There's only a small percentage that really understand that he's really trying to stay 
[00:02:30]  sober.  Right.  The rest of the people are like, fuck, let's go tune in Charlie Sheen.  He's probably going to be doing lines of coke tonight live in front of everybody.  That's what people probably thought.  Sure.  I think there's a massive amount of people that thought that.  And then you tune this thing in and realize he's not partying, really.  One of the goddesses went home for a little while.  Yeah, yeah.  I hear she's back now.  And it was a complete train wreck.  It really was one of the worst things I've seen on webcasts. 
[00:03:00]  Like, his biggest problem was there was nothing interesting going on.  Whether it was him doing lines of coke off of 12 hookers' asses, or him sitting there  and maybe telling some story about the filming of Platoon.  Like, something.  Make it interesting.  I don't even know if he got into any topics.  No, he didn't.  Yeah, I know.  It was just kind of rambling.  It was...  I was thinking, like, all right.  If he doesn't have this prepared material, like, he was trying to do a show. 
[00:03:30]  He was trying too hard to do a formatted show with topics and stuff.  You're Charlie Sheen.  He could have just sat there and talked about what happened.  And maybe a humorous anecdote about Wall Street.  Right.  Or, like I said, Platoon.  Right.  Or, you know, he's so fucking into Apocalypse Now and shit.  Talk about that a little more in depth than just saying you have a channel that runs all  the time.  Or trash the two and a half men people.  Whatever.  But he doesn't want to do that. 
[00:04:00]  No, no.  You notice he's not really talking about those guys as much these days.  No, no.  Because he wants that cushy gig back.  Something interesting.  But it was a complete lack of anything interesting.  Well, there was a lack of focus.  Yeah, there was nothing going on.  I mean, we joke about how we're not prepared for the show and we just wing it.  But the fact is, we know what the fuck we're doing.  We've been doing this a really long time.  And I was telling Ant before the show, there's so many people, because the whole world has  changed and the whole media is changing, and everyone is convinced they could do a podcast,  which is a radio show. 
[00:04:30]  It's a radio show with video.  And guess what?  It's not easy.  That's why there's not many of us doing it.  It's very difficult.  Doing it to the level that we're doing it to.  He was trying to keep his head above water within the first ten minutes.  And I think he wanted to go longer than he did.  Yeah, he was sweating.  But he had nothing.  That was flop sweat.  Flop sweat.  That was flop sweat.  And then he finally said, fuck it.  Let's get out of here.  Winning.  Dude, this experiment. 
[00:05:00]  Dude, winning.  Got this experiment, dude.  Winning.  Duh.  Yeah.  And the guy in the back corner was playing like fart sound effects.  You could barely hear him, but who cared?  Because they were fart sound effects.  It's like for no reason.  I mean, a good fart sound effect can get people whoring.  You've got to know when to use the fart sound effects.  It was awful.  You just can't throw it on the radio.  You can't just throw it on for nothing.  And then he had his crony next to him, the older guy.  I don't know who the fuck that is.  I have no idea. 
[00:05:30]  And he was useless.  And then his goddess, which she did a segment called Plan Better.  Was that one of his hashtags?  Yes.  And it was abominable.  It was awful.  I couldn't watch it.  I think a sober Charlie Sheen is pretty much a bore.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It's a bore.  I mean, it was exciting when the first interview started on TV because you could tell he was  off the coke maybe a few hours.  A few hours maybe, yeah.  And now it looks like he's been off it for a while. 
[00:06:00]  It seems.  I don't know.  I don't know that world.  Yeah.  But it seems like he is.  And the more and more he gets sober, he seems like a pretty boring guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He really does.  He doesn't seem like a guy that's really interesting.  Sorry to break down the wall because everyone loves Charlie Sheen.  Oh, they love him.  They can't get enough of him.  But two words.  Ted Williams.  We loved Ted Williams for a week, too.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Now it's time to break down the Charlie Sheen.  Someone's got to start it.  Hi, Mommy.  Hi, Mommy.  Hi, Mommy, dude.  Winning. 
[00:06:30]  Whatever.  We got a few clips from Sheen's Corner, by the way.  Oh, Sheen's Corner.  Opie, with a K, by the way.  I know.  That's crazy.  With a K.  That's crazy shit.  Which, by the way, is crazy with a K.  Right, right.  Like the glue.  So is Brie Olsen back, our old friend?  I don't know.  I heard she jumped in her car.  There was a little fight or something.  Oh, boy.  I don't know.  Charlie was in the paper yesterday saying he chipped a great white tooth on a...  What? 
[00:07:00]  He was sitting there.  There was a vampire thing with a great white tooth biting into something, and that's why  she had to leave.  I don't know.  He's trying so hard.  I couldn't follow that one.  I'm sorry, Charlie.  Sorry, Charlie.  Sorry that I'm not on board with the Charlie Sheen thing as much as everybody else.  Then you're hanging with the trolls.  Look, I was in there.  I was in there in the beginning, but now it's getting silly.  I mean, that Ustream thing was god-awful.  You're either in Sheen's Corner or you're with the trolls.  Don't you understand?  All right.  I'll be the king of the trolls. 
[00:07:30]  I am so with the trolls.  All right, good.  Thank God you said that.  I am so with the trolls on this one.  I was worried about you.  I'm thinking, God, is Ant still digging this?  Because I know you were doing the simulcast and stuff, and I was in as well.  I saw the thing, and I went, okay, it's over.  It's over.  This guy can't do a radio show.  Here's the deal.  We're safe.  I was doing the simulcast, but I knew by that point it was so over that the simulcast was  nothing but a huge Hollywood show goof on the simulcast. 
[00:08:00]  I actually own a tux.  Why?  I actually do own a tux.  You're a creep.  I figured I should have one for special occasions.  So it's just easier than renting a tux.  Than renting a tux.  And it comes in handy when you're doing gala events, like the Charlie Sheen fucking Sheen's  Corner debut.  Oh, God.  It really did look ridiculous.  There's a picture of you going around that you were pretty much pointing a gun at the 
[00:08:30]  camera.  That's wonderful.  Yeah, yeah.  It was a camera.  What are you going to do?  Oh, wait.  There's one of the goddesses sitting on Sheen's lap.  With his hipster hat and his R2-D2 microphone.  And I guess you have to wear the hipster hat if you're in Sheen's corner, right?  Yeah, yeah.  That's probably mandatory.  You've got to be one of the guys that just kind of walk around and laugh at everything  he says.  You've got to do that.  And, yeah, you've got to wear the hat.  He's got a winning tattoo on his wrist. 
[00:09:00]  Is it real?  I'm not sure if that's real because, Danny, you're pretty up on tats.  Wouldn't that be more red and raw?  When is he claiming that he got it?  He must have just got it.  He had to just get it.  And if he did just get it, wouldn't, unless somebody came over the house, and if they did  come over, wouldn't he videotape a video, record it?  I hate saying tape anymore.  You think he would?  I mean, especially considering it.  Yeah, and if he went out for it, don't you think there'd be a picture?  Hey, Charlie Sheen goes out to get a tat. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, but that's what I'm trying to say.  If he knew what the hell he was really doing with this whole thing, a video of him getting  the winning tattoo would be something great to check out online.  Right, right.  Not just him showing something.  Like, there's no redness on that at all.  On the boundaries, right?  And it's a new tat where he had a bandage over it.  Like, hey, it was that new where he pulled a bandage off of it.  Yeah, I mean, if you're pulling a bandage off a tat, it's most likely going to be, like,  greasy and slimy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:10:00]  Because you got a lot of, you know, there's a lot of scabbed up blood, plus, you know,  there's going to be, like, bacitrecin, some kind of antibacterial goo.  Yeah, and there was nothing like that.  So I'm calling shenanigans.  And there definitely would be, if it was as fresh as he's claiming, there would be some  redness.  Redness.  There's none.  So we're questioning the tattoo tat.  It looks like Sharpie tat.  Swampass from Boston writes, who's worse, PFG TV or Sheen's Ustream show?  Wow.  Holy shit.  What a great question.  That's a trick question, by the way. 
[00:10:30]  Because they're so bad, it's good.  Right.  Was Charlie Sheen so bad, it was good?  No.  That means PFG TV wins.  PFG TV better.  PFG TV wins the podcast battle.  You got it.  I think you're absolutely right, because...  Is there a new episode of PFG TV, by the way?  Have you checked?  I hope so.  I'm checking tonight.  Sam would know.  Sam is the one that keeps tabs on.  I'm checking tonight to see if there is one.  That, of course, is Scorch's local access show. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  It's fantastic.  Yeah.  And at least something, you know, it's funny to laugh at.  Mm-hmm.  This one, I wasn't even laughing.  I was cringing.  If you like, like, cringe-inducing shit, the Charlie Sheen thing, where he's just looking  around going, um, um, what are we going to?  And then he...  That's always when you go, well, this is just kind of an experiment.  He's delusional.  Dude.  You got to realize you got to have some material to back up this popularity.  Yeah.  And, uh, he certainly didn't have the material during the Ustream thing. 
[00:11:30]  The only thing it was good for was, uh, I was playing the Charlie Sheen hashtag catchphrase  drinking game.  Right.  Where whenever he said something that is usually followed by a hashtag, or started with a hashtag,  his little catchphrase is, you got to drink.  That's nice.  And it was insane, the pace you had to drink at.  Really?  Because every two seconds, he was saying winning.  Tiger blood.  Or fucking tiger blood.  God, or whatever the fuck else he's saying.  Uh, goddesses.  Uh, so it was really, um... 
[00:12:00]  And then he had a segment where he would just say shit.  Like, people, I guess, were in the chat room saying, hey, say this.  And he would say one of his lines.  Really?  It's like, what the...  What are you doing?  Yeah, there's a little...  The sound was bad.  It was real echoey.  So he didn't even really figure out the...  The sound of the whole...  No, the sound was really bad.  I think it was just that one mic in the middle of the room.  Really?  The R2-D2 microphone, I was calling it.  Right. 
[00:12:30]  And, uh, it was echoey.  Uh, and he didn't have any material.  He's popping pictures up in the middle of his own screen,  so it wouldn't even go to a different screen with a picture.  It was just...  It would cut off the middle of his actual video feed.  And, I don't know.  What's with the money sign?  The money sign on his...  Well, dude, he's winning.  Is he becoming a villain or something?  He's winning.  Yeah.  And then, at one point, he's just rummaging through his drawers.  Right.  Through his desk drawers, like, like,  yeah, what do I got here? 
[00:13:00]  Well, it's this, uh, winning.  Let me go to Jimmy James in New Hampshire.  JJ!  Hey, morning, boys.  Morning, JJ.  Hey, you guys always talk about the news having to make it local.  Well, Boston topped them all today and made Charlie Sheen local.  How'd they do that?  How'd they do that, right?  With all Charlie Sheen's talk of trolls and warlocks, what do the real trolls and warlocks  of Salem Mass think?  Oh, no.  Come on.  Yeah, I read about that. 
[00:13:30]  The, um, the witches and warlocks up there in Salem Mass, you know?  Mm-hmm.  They're, uh, they're very mad at Charlie Sheen for, um, for using, for using the term, you  know, warlock, Vatican assassin, Vatican assassin, duh, duh.  Uh, so they're, they're, uh, very angry with him and, and don't want them to use that anymore.  So even the warlocks have, have sensitivity issues?  Yes.  Jesus.  Even warlocks.  If you're a warlock, you're, you're the one person that shouldn't be sensitive to anything.  Dr. Bombay, Dr. Bombay, emergency, come right away. 
[00:14:00]  I, I, I, we gotta play a couple of the highlights from Sheen's Corner for everybody on our show.  Lowlights.  It's gonna be great.  Not winning, certainly.  Not winning.  Let's do the not winning on this one.  Sorry, Charlie.  Sorry, Charlie.  But, uh, this was not a big win for you, sir.  No.  And also, I want to announce that we're officially, uh, uh, not gonna have Charlie Sheen on our  radio show.  Nope.  He's done way too many interviews.  We're, we're out.  We're out.  Don't want it.  Did we try to get Charlie Sheen on our show?  Absolutely. 
[00:14:30]  Just like everybody else in America.  He's done too many interviews now, so we're done.  We don't, we have no desire to talk to Charlie Sheen.  We gotta take ourselves out of the fucking game.  It really is.  Cause he's down to doing just local fucking radio now.  That was so douchey.  Uh, let's hear a couple of the clips.  Sheen introduces his new show.  Good evening, everyone.  From Sherman Oaks.  To Wine Gardens.  To the gas giant Jupiter.  And of course, from my big, beautiful warlock brain, welcome to Sheen's Corner. 
[00:15:00]  You're either in my corner, or you're with the trolls.  Now, before we get into Sheen's Corner here, I'll explain to you what's going on tonight,  which is, uh, basically a, um, kind of a disorganized, uh, random experiment of sorts.  Um, I need to give a, uh, big shout out to my, to my, to my children, uh, Cassandra, uh, Sam,  See, you hear the sound effects?  Bob, and Max.  Daddy loves you, and if you're watching, tell Mom to leave the room. 
[00:15:30]  It's on.  Did you have a great link to the show?  Winning!  Winning.  Winning, winning.  Really uncomfortable.  Wow.  It's really uncomfortable.  He didn't get his kids back?  Uh, I guess not.  Huh.  Uh, yeah, he, he didn't get his kids back.  Um, he, he put on that abomination of a show.  God, I wish we went up against, like, shows like this when we were on regular radio.  Oh!  This would have been an easy win. 
[00:16:00]  Win.  This would have been a win.  Winning, winning.  And, and, like I said, there's so many, uh, opportunities for him to be interesting.  Uh-huh.  And it just, that he didn't do anything.  I mean, we've been at this, uh, this game for a long time.  I mean, so let's go through this.  Yeah.  The sound.  Let me be like Charlie Sheen.  Go ahead.  I'll be like the Charlie Sheen show.  You know when we start our...  What?  What?  Well, are you throwing in...  It was all because of this terrible, awful...  Are you throwing in sound effects just to throw him in? 
[00:16:30]  Willy Nilly!  All right, so we'll start with Willy Nilly sound effects.  Willy Nilly sound effects.  Can we start a list?  Willy Nilly sound effects.  Willy Nilly sound effects.  If, uh, Mr. Sheen is listening and he wants some expert advice from, from me and Ann, because  we've been doing this a very long time.  Yeah.  You can't have Willy Nilly sound effects.  No Willy Nilly sound effects.  You gotta know when to hit that button.  I love you, Johnny Cakes.  You wanna eat me?  Good.  Okay, bugger, what's next?  It's just, there's...  Gotta know when to hit those.  Gotta really. 
[00:17:00]  Secondly, you know, some mornings we get in here and, uh, our microphones sound just slightly  tinny?  A little tinny, yeah.  And to the, to you, the listener, you're sitting there like, it sounds fucking fine,  asshole.  Mm-hmm.  But that's how, how seriously we take what we sound like every morning.  It's...  Even if it's off a little bit, we lose our fucking minds.  This guy didn't even set up his microphones properly.  No.  So that's number two.  If you're gonna do some kind of podcast or radio show, you gotta make sure people can  hear you. 
[00:17:30]  He's in the distance.  Yeah, everything was echoey because there was one mic in the middle of a room.  He should have had one mic on him because he's Charlie Sheen.  Yeah.  And then maybe another microphone in the room to, to pick up everybody else.  Background noise.  And...  And that's a basic setup.  Right.  He could have done way better than that even.  And, uh, Charlie Sheen, uh, some type of monitoring device, headphone, earbud, whatever you need  to be able to hear that you're talking over someone else or someone else is talking over  you or the sound effects are playing at all. 
[00:18:00]  Number three.  Headphones for everybody.  Right.  Everyone needs to know what's going on.  This past, uh, Friday we had an, uh, an amazing show where we'll have to talk about  it later.  Car Crash Comedy was a huge hit.  Fantastic.  And we kept yelling at Rich Voss, put your headphones on.  Tell me.  Because we had, what, five or six guys that were all trying to compete for lines and shit.  Yes.  So, Rich was taking his headphones off, so he was talking all over everybody at times.  Yeah, yeah.  So, Sheen, you needed headphones for everybody. 
[00:18:30]  By the way, uh, we should send a bill to him.  This is free advice.  This is, um...  From experts at radio.  Yeah, we're consulting the, uh, Charlie Sheen's, uh, Sheen's Corner.  Uh, Sheen explains Breeze.  Absence.  Oh, and of course, and of course, uh, everybody's wondering where the other half to this, this,  this beautiful goddess union might be.  She's, um, she had to go take care of some business.  We won't say where.  Do we know where she went?  Well, of course we do.  Some little town in the middle of America.  Some little town in the middle of America.  Um, the rich. 
[00:19:00]  We love you.  We miss you.  Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah.  The Rachel.  The Rachel.  Once again, just, uh, horrible mic technique, obviously.  And, uh, really, the clapping, um, thing.  They did that a few times.  Just clapping?  Well, everyone in the room was a yes man to him, so everything he said was hysterically  funny, interesting, worthy of guffaws and applause.  Oh, yeah.  That starts to sound douchey after a while. 
[00:19:30]  Yes.  What's your take on the goddesses?  My take is that, uh, they're really not getting much of anything.  No, no, I don't think so either.  I think it's, uh.  I think he's putting it in every once in a while, but I don't think he's really, uh,  rocking their worlds.  No, no, I don't think so.  That's just my opinion.  And I'm thinking maybe.  I think they like the attention.  And maybe the one left because she really wanted, you know, a good one.  Get back to, uh.  She really needed and wanted a good one.  Maybe she had work to do, too.  Or something.  And then, you know, now she's back for the silliness.  Yeah. 
[00:20:00]  The attention.  I mean, you know, you kind of, a lot of people like riding this fucking, uh,  rocket ship thing.  Oh, my God, yeah.  Until it gets ready to crash and then everyone jumps off.  She used to do our show and now she's one of the most famous people in America right now.  Do our show?  Well, she fucking jerked Earl off.  She jerked Earl off and, uh, she had a crush on Jim Norton.  Yes.  Now she's hanging with Charlie Sheen.  I think she did more than that.  Didn't she do something with Cream Pie, Tim?  Yes, she certainly did.  What'd she do with Cream Pie?  Cream Pie Jones.  Allegedly.  Because I swear I wasn't in that room. 
[00:20:30]  So what Danny's about to say is word of mouth.  Whatever.  And I think it was more than just...  And by the way, for the people, Cream Pie Jones is the guy who starred in Duty Hat.  Right.  He's Big Boy Made a Duty Kid.  Big Boy Made a Duty, which is still one of my favorite videos of all time, even though  it's not popular in the mainstream community.  Allegedly, Cream Pie Jones finished, to completion, inside Brie Olsen's mouth.  Oh, really?  And I do believe Earl was much more than just some hands.  Really?  Yeah.  I thought it was just a hand job. 
[00:21:00]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  What else went on with those two?  Oh, blow job.  Was that in front of us, though?  Yes.  Oh, oh, she went down on him?  Right in the air.  Yeah, yeah, okay.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I did kind of think I remembered that.  I didn't think it was just a handy.  Yeah, no, it was more than that.  Yeah, yeah.  Huh.  Oh, that's right.  Because then there was a Jim Norton crush.  I don't know how far that went officially.  Yeah, because then we, I remember, because everybody was like, well, that does away with  any kissing of Brie after that one, after Black Earl's dick was in her mouth. 
[00:21:30]  So we had Brie Olsen, and we could have done whatever we wanted with her, and we chose  to get Cream Pie Jones and Black Earl Douglas blowjobs.  And Black Earl, I know, what the fuck?  All right, so could we add that to kind of things Charlie should be doing?  I don't want to make this an official list, but if you've got porn stars hanging around,  then you've got to have the porn stars doing something.  Like blowing your friends.  Blowing your friends.  Blowing your buds.  You're not going to be bummed in the end, right?  Have her blow on the fucking guy that's doing the willy-nilly sound effects.  Maybe you'll stop fucking pressing the buttons.  Right, she certainly was with at least two of our guys. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  And we have nothing but respect for Brie Olsen.  Oh, please.  We're all big fans.  Please.  She's done great radio for us.  Winning.  Winning.  Winning.  Duh.  Duh.  Sheen unveils his winning tattoo.  And a lot of tattoo guys checking in, Danny, completely agreeing with you, saying that  that damn thing should have been a little redder and a little swollen around the edges,  especially and maybe raised up a bit, right?  A little bit, sure.  He does have a tat there. 
[00:22:30]  I mean, look, whether it's real or not remains to be seen.  However, him unwrapping it was completely for dramatic effect.  He does have a Denise tat there.  He had.  I'm looking at old pictures, and it did say Denise.  So whatever he did on his wrist there, be it real or fake, is covering up his Denise  tat.  Okay.  So this is a good possibility.  He went for a cover tat.  He just sharpened it.  I think he sharpened it.  Oh, you think he just sharpened it?  Yeah, yeah.  Really?  I think he sharpened it.  Breaking fucking news from Anthony Tomia.  That's my opinion on it. 
[00:23:00]  Where most hosts at this point would, I guess, go into the traditional transparent and boring  portion of their intro.  So, see, Charlie, no offense, I gotta stick up for even the guys that don't even do radio  that well.  You're not setting the radio world on fire.  Because let's remember, this is a radio show that you could look at.  That's all it is.  And he's saying, you know, not going with the normal transparent monologue, boring, boring.  No, give it a try. 
[00:23:30]  Because what he did as an option to that was nothing.  So maybe you should give that a try.  If you want to know how this would be, just put me and Anthony on the two and a half men  set.  And go.  Right.  And go, go.  Go.  Now go.  Oh, you're taking Charlie Sheen's part.  Go.  Where do we stand?  Is there cue cards?  What does the director mean by that?  Right.  I don't get it. 
[00:24:00]  Look, someone has to say it, man.  That's exactly it.  He doesn't know how to do this shit.  And he's not going to figure it out anytime soon.  And he's only interesting if you think he's going to be doing coke at any second.  I just don't think he has the gift of gab.  He says a lot.  And he says it in weird voices and catchphrases.  And people go like, oh, that's something.  But he's not saying anything of substance.  You know, at this point, I appreciate a good catchphrase.  Unfortunately, in my life, I have not come up with a good one. 
[00:24:30]  A good catchphrase.  I got brother man, brother man.  Brother man didn't quite pan out.  I got a few of them.  Yeah, yeah.  Not worthy of a t-shirt, unfortunately.  So I'll give him that much.  He knows how to get a good catchphrase out there.  He does.  But as far as doing radio, fuck no.  Yeah, so he tries with that.  But if he would just sit down, like I said, he's probably got great Hollywood stories he  can convey about being a bad boy in Hollywood or something.  And sit there and be compelling in front of a mic telling these stories. 
[00:25:00]  Agreed.  But he is incapable of doing that.  Not everybody can spin a yarn.  And he can't go after the two and a half men people anymore because it's obvious they're  working on something behind the scenes.  So he's in a tough spot.  He can't fucking party.  Duh.  Because that's going to fuck up his two and a half men thing that he's trying to work  out.  Plus he wants to get his kids back.  And he can't do regular radio and talk about Hollywood.  He's fucked.  Yeah.  He's in a horrible position.  He should shut down everything right now. 
[00:25:30]  He really should.  Now he's just going to blow the buzz he created for himself.  He should really back the fuck off.  He was critiquing his own performance and saying it was treasonous.  Oh, really?  To the cause.  Yeah, it certainly was.  But the next one's not going to be any better.  Of course it's not.  All right, good.  Sheen unveils his winning tattoo.  Portion of their intro.  My monologue looks something like this.  This has not been seen yet.  I'm unveiling this for the first time. 
[00:26:00]  I'm live.  Computer vision.  Computer vision.  There it is.  Can we see it?  Do we see it?  No.  By the way, his graphic was covering it.  So it was a classic Jimmy would have been pissed thing.  He puts his wrist down and he's got the Charlie Sheen graphic up.  It says you're either in Sheen's corner or with the trolls.  And the at Charlie Sheen.  And he put his hand right there and it covered up the wrist. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, well, I mean, we're critiquing him today.  And I hope some of this audio gets out there to the people in the know, in the media, because  I'm sure they're going to be talking about this today.  And we are experts at this.  And you've done a few of these at-home podcasts, certainly.  So you've got to know where your graphics are on the screen.  Right, right.  As a goof, I have a few graphics that are so big and obnoxious, they take up almost the  entire screen.  But that's a goof.  And it says a goof.  And your viewers know it's a goof.  Yeah, just kind of peek out over the top of it and talk about great things that are happening 
[00:27:00]  underneath it.  Yeah, Mr. Sheen's got to understand where his graphics are.  Right.  And he did not understand that on Saturday night.  No, he didn't.  Hey, by the way, people saying I'm a black ninja motherfucker's t-shirt worthy.  Oh, wait a minute.  That's a catchphrase I came up with.  Did that really take off?  Was it hashtag-able?  Well, it goes back.  Before hashtags.  It goes back a few years.  And now with a very bad herniated back, I don't know how much of a black ninja I am anymore. 
[00:27:30]  And then there's Mudahucka.  We all remember.  Absolutely worthy of a t-shirt.  T-shirt, Jordan says.  Let me think if I could picture a hashtag.  And I got a good luck, bro.  That's another one of my catchphrases I was hoping was going to catch on.  Good luck, bro, is something that you tell somebody that probably won't be making it  for another six to eight weeks.  No, I did that to the great Peter Jennings.  Peter Jennings, who summarily dropped dead.  Yeah, months before he died when I saw him walking in Central Park with his family.  And boy, was he walking slow because he was getting oxygen for the last time. 
[00:28:00]  And I was stupid enough to say good luck, bro.  Good luck.  That is a true story.  Bro.  And then there's the Linger Longer, which I may have coined as well.  But I don't know if any of those are t-shirt worthy.  Linger Longer?  That's the Greaseman.  Yeah, we made our own, I guess.  Yeah, I guess I can't really take that one then, right?  No, the bottle doodle you might as well take then.  Did he used to say Linger Longer?  Where are you?  Linger Longer.  And then we mocked it and made it our own.  Yeah, you're right. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  You're right.  Linger Longer.  Sheen unveils his winning tattoo.  Let's get back to this.  Can we see it?  What is it?  What do you think it is?  A tattoo?  Yes, it is.  Yes.  Winning.  Window.  Winning.  What?  Because guess what we're doing?  Guess what we're doing all day?  Winning.  Winning.  Winning.  Winning.  Winning.  I've been telling you to everyone out there who thinks that they've been winning.  This was tough for the drinking game, this part, by the way.  That is, in fact, winning.  I want you to go to your window. 
[00:29:00]  I want you to open it because if you don't, then no one can hear you.  And I want you to join our chant.  Winning.  Winning.  Winning.  Drink.  Drink.  Drink.  Drink.  Drink.  Drink.  Drink.  Drink.  Oh, it was so hard.  It was very difficult Saturday night.  Yeah, because of the Charlie Sheen drinking game.  Yes.  Wow.  I should have watched you watching this.  But I was...  A lot of people said, yeah.  But I had to go to Red State.  Oh, I know, yeah.  I would have liked to have seen Red State, but I wasn't going to come back into the city. 
[00:29:30]  I understand.  There was way too much stuff going on.  And, you know, when something like the likes of a Charlie Sheen doing his inaugural podcast,  I have to be there to cover it.  But it seemed way too controlled.  Yeah, yeah.  See, he can't get the girls naked because he's got the kids that we're taking away from.  Right.  He's fucked.  So everything he did...  So this looked very nerdy, man.  The only moment that was dangerous...  There was a dangerous moment? 
[00:30:00]  There was a dangerous moment for a second, is his producer, or whoever it was that was  in front of him behind the camera, blurted out somebody's name that was asking a question.  And he goes, uh, I got a question from Porch Monkey, is saying...  And Charlie Sheen looked around like, what the fuck are you insane?  His face was like, what the fuck are you crazy?  Like, people are going to be watching this and calling me out on it.  You could see his mind working.  Right.  He didn't say it.  Right.  But you could see his mind working and saying, like, people are going to be watching this. 
[00:30:30]  I could be crucified.  Don't Mel Gibson me on this motherfucker.  Like, which made him sane enough to know that was probably not the wisest thing to do.  And, uh, I know Mark Cuban, another friend of the show, we haven't had him on in a while,  is looking at a reality show with Charlie Sheen.  Really?  Yeah, there's rumors about that and a few other places.  Don't do it.  You're not going to get anything.  Yeah, I really think...  You're not going to get anything because eventually he's going to get his kids back in the house.  So then the girls are definitely going to have to go.  So you're not going to have a big party, crazy scene at Charlie Sheen's house. 
[00:31:00]  You're just not going to get it.  All the great stuff with Charlie Sheen happened.  Yeah.  And it's not going to happen again anytime soon.  And I wish these people would understand that.  He needs a script and a director.  Or he needs to get back on the coke and go, look, fuck it.  All right, I'm going to go back to old school Charlie Sheen.  And yeah, let's let the cameras roll.  If he does that, it'll be the most amazing TV show ever.  Reality show.  You know what's fucked up? 
[00:31:30]  You see the Charlie Sheen that we're seeing now, which is nothing like the Charlie Sheen we all remember in movies and even the straight interview and stuff.  But you see him now and you realize what those coke parties must have been like in the hotels.  Just him rambling some inane fucking babble with these whores going around just using him for his coke and money and shit.  It's now you could see it.  Like before I was thinking, all right, he was fucked up. 
[00:32:00]  But then what is he sober up?  And he's kind of like, like in the morning, like, oh, my God, what did I do?  I fucked up.  I ended up.  We all have that feeling, right?  Yeah.  But he doesn't.  Like, I could see him just going like, yeah, well, fuck it.  Whatever.  Dude.  Yeah.  Like, it just continues.  He's him being an asshole.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's all I see.  I wish we could give this.  There's nothing going on here.  You want to keep going?  There was.  Oh, we might as well.  They start a segment that would make Nick Cannon cringe. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  The segments.  I did not see this part.  They were so bad.  Weighing in with Rick.  Oh, look.  So this is a morning.  I just got goosebumps.  Really?  It's not even a morning.  It's a nothing happens.  It's a dead end street.  It's trying to make something where nothing is.  It was astonishing to watch.  Let me let me go to Cassius in Brooklyn.  Cassius, what's up? 
[00:33:00]  Mohamed.  Hey, man.  Yeah, good morning.  I met Cassius.  He was part of the Car Crash Comedy audience, man.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Ooh.  So glad that meeting me was such a fucking thrill for you.  What's going on, brother?  I'm sorry.  I just didn't hear you there.  I'm just fucking around.  What's up, buddy?  It was great.  It was great.  Bob Kelly was a total asshole to me, I got to say.  Oh.  Really?  He tried grabbing my arm and tossing me out because he thought I said something.  It was like a guy two seats away from me.  And then he was a total prick to me the whole rest of the show. 
[00:33:30]  He's really nuts.  Well, what do you got, brother?  Yeah, I thought that, I think Charlie responded to you on Twitter when he said how bad the  show was.  And it was just like a few minutes later, you know, he said, I admit it was treasonous  and we're going to try doing, you know, a video, something else on video.  He was responding to the tons of tweets that came in.  I would love to think that Charlie Sheen responded to my tweet where I did trash the show in 
[00:34:00]  140 characters, but like Ann said, we're not the only ones saying this, unfortunately.  He's getting destroyed for doing this.  Tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people.  God, I would love to think it was me.  That were saying he sucked.  I'm not that delusional.  Oh.  Believe me.  Yeah.  I'm brand new to Twitter, so, you know, I don't have enough activity.  All right.  Thank you, Cassius.  We're going to go back to weighing in with Rick. 
[00:34:30]  Sheen's Corner with a K.  Do people watching know we didn't rehearse the show?  No.  No.  There's no way.  It's seamless.  How can we have done all these nuances perfectly?  That's just how we go.  You hear the sound effect?  Barely.  That's the other thing.  You got to test all this stuff before you do it.  We actually, we joke around like we don't give a fuck.  We just come in here and all that.  The fact is, Mars is here an hour beforehand, and he tests everything every morning. 
[00:35:00]  Even though that we've been doing this for a few years in this facility now, every morning  he goes through our replays, makes sure the sound effects are at the proper level.  Right.  He does a mic check.  Everything.  Exactly.  If you're going to do sound effects, you got to make sure they're in the mix where you  could hear them.  And he's just playing them over.  Like, wasn't someone talking there?  What was it?  Ah!  Yeah, but it's not even like, I don't know how he's got stuff hooked up over there, but  it's like not going into the mix.  No!  It sounds like he's playing it out of an amp and it's getting picked up by the room mic. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, that makes sense.  I think that is.  Like a little speaker or something in the back.  Yeah, he probably doesn't have an in for that.  Oh, come on, Charlie.  You make two million an episode.  Get a mixer.  Pop a mixer up on your desk.  Yeah, with the money he's making, and he's in L.A., obviously, he could have hired someone  to just give him a great fucking state-of-the-art studio for nothing.  With all those guys just sucking on his dick, I mean, just say, give him a thousand dollars,  be like, hey, go to Sam Ash, get me some stuff.  Yeah, really.  And be like, okay, Charlie, and then go do it.  Yeah, of course.  You're winning. 
[00:36:00]  Winning.  Winning.  Winning.  Winning.  Thank you.  Okay, all right.  So this is the segment.  Right, stay over here.  It's called Weighing In With Rick.  Weighing In With Rick.  And what I want you guys to do, this is how we're here.  Okay, good.  So what I want is everybody to Twitter in what you guys want us to weigh in on.  Subject matters as deep as, have you ever gone to the shopping center and got home and the  metal detector, shoplifting metal detector is still on their hands? 
[00:36:30]  Classic clog.  Classic clog?  Classic clog.  Classic clog, yeah.  Oh, thank you, thank you.  It's called a sensor.  If you ever got home and it's still on there, and you don't know whether to go back to the  grove, park on the third level, and trek through the-  There's a third level.  Not for me.  Do you head into the garage, get out the tools, and start jamming on it?  Can you honestly believe this?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Can you-  These are the things that I want you guys at home to get on your scale and weigh in on. 
[00:37:00]  So let me know, would you guys go back to the store?  Or would you guys go to the garage and get it off?  Anything?  Did I say get it off?  Sorry, we're going to back down, right?  I just got scolded.  No, no, no.  Weighing in with Rick.  Thank you.  Hey!  Trust me.  Trust me.  I got some effects in jail.  Is it better than ours?  Probably.  Well, no.  Trust me.  This is a segment you can all come to just embracing a big warm hug now. 
[00:37:30]  No.  It's really hard to haul.  Holy shit.  Can you-  That was-  It's horrible, Charlie.  It was painful.  It's really, really bad.  That was painful.  I think this thing is over by Friday, man.  Rick should weigh himself with a noose.  That's very funny.  But I'm sure they weren't making fun of each other, right?  Oh, no, no.  No, there wasn't any bashing going on.  It was all just rah, rah, rah.  Yeah, it was very, very safe. 
[00:38:00]  Very, you know, rah, rah.  Go, Charlie.  I don't even know if I want to play the rest of these clips.  Oh, come on.  It's getting tougher and tougher.  We only have just a few highlights for everybody.  We're only going to do it this one time.  Yeah.  I just love-  Because it is a beautiful example of somebody that is completely out of their element and  has no business doing it.  And when I-  But the concept, once again, sounds great.  If he was doing all the stuff that got him in trouble to begin with. 
[00:38:30]  And when I'm sitting there and I look over and see that he had 110,000 people watching him.  Oh, well, of course he's going to have the numbers.  That's fantastic.  It dropped off real fast.  I heard that he was dropping numbers by the minute, though.  But it's like, God, that's-  He wasn't holding anyone's interest.  That's something.  Of course.  That's amazing.  Of course he's doing numbers right now.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You know, and are we jealous of that?  Duh.  Duh.  Duh. 
[00:39:00]  But-  It was-  No, I knew it was going to be a numbers.  But you've got to back up your numbers.  I mean, you know, Ashton Kutcher has fucking whatever million followers on Twitter and tweets  nothing of interest.  Kim Kardashian has a shitload of followers, millions.  She tweets nothing of interest.  She actually tweeted last night that she was snuggling with her sister.  Who gives a fuck?  Yeah, I could picture that, though.  Duh.  Duh.  Big boobies.  Winning. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Do you think they get naked and snuggled together?  Snuggled together all nude?  All nude and stuff.  Do you think they're nude?  Do you think that's going on?  I don't know.  Charlie's wish they were me list.  What's this?  Oh, God.  This is people that he assumes wish they were Charlie Sheen.  And then he did another segment where it was Charlie wishes he was other people for a few minutes, for like ten minutes.  But this segment was people that wish they were Charlie Sheen. 
[00:40:00]  It really gives no explanation.  Okay, so wish they were me forever.  Dr. Drew Pinsky.  That's exactly the comment that we needed.  A guy coughing off camera.  Okay, Pinsky.  We're going.  I'm not really a fan of Dr. Drew myself.  But, you know, wishing he was.  I don't think Dr. Drew wishes he was Charlie Sheen.  I've got to be honest.  I don't think.  I think Dr. Drew is in a quandary as well.  He's a bit hypocritical. 
[00:40:30]  I believe the guy.  And we know the same people, by the way.  And someone that represents us might represent him.  So we're pretty connected to him, technically.  But I think he's torn.  Because I think he really does help people.  I really believe that.  But that celebrity rehab is a joke.  It really is.  He's really not helping any of those celebrities.  Because the main thing they're addicted to is fame.  Fame.  They love it.  But he doesn't want to acknowledge that that's why they're doing his celebrity rehab TV show.  They love the fame. 
[00:41:00]  That's the number one addiction most of those people have.  Yeah.  Besides the pills and whatever else they're on.  But they don't even fucking go there on the TV show.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  All right.  Let's move on with the wish they were me list.  I'm gone.  Fleeto.  Fleeto.  Flicked away and gone.  Nancy Grace.  Wish they were me forever.  Nancy Grace.  I know there's like a male-female thing.  But whatever.  Now I do have to say this.  I do have to say this about the woman.  She somehow, like Houdini's little sister, Houdina. 
[00:41:30]  That was like...  What happened?  They laughed like it was a funny fucking great joke.  But I missed the joke, I think.  Exactly.  Oh.  Because there wasn't a joke there.  Oh, there wasn't a joke there?  You only missed it because it was stealth.  It was a stealth joke.  Duh.  Cleverly disguised as something else.  Duh.  Duh.  Oh, we got to get into the Cyndi Lauper thing, by the way.  Oh, yeah.  Singing at the airport.  Boy, I'm sure that made everyone so much better. 
[00:42:00]  I know.  That made me feel better.  But why can't the news say that?  Right.  So she sang a dumb song who gives a fuck.  I'm still fucking in hell in the airport.  Yeah.  Didn't help anybody.  Duh.  That's all I want to do this morning, though.  I'll be honest.  Duh.  That's the worst joke ever.  She somehow kept the desk here and hid a pregnancy from CNN Court TV.  All of them.  True TV now.  Yeah, she hid it.  But Nancy Grace, just after that drubbing that you asked me to tune into the other night, 
[00:42:30]  which was like, I turned to the TV and there's like all these little boxes and all these little  people, and they're like screaming at me and screaming at me and screaming at me.  And I'm like, shut up.  Make it all the way.  We're going to mute.  Now I can study you all and dissect your brains.  So how Grace exists in your name, I'm really confused by it.  I'm sure you are too deep down.  So I wish I could say you guys are ending, but you're not.  I'd rather listen to Scorch.  Yeah. 
[00:43:00]  And someone on Twitter is asking, who's better?  Charlie Sheen.  Listen to this closely.  Right.  Or who's worse?  Okay, sure.  JF, I can't do your Twitter name.  They're too long and fucking complicated.  Who's worse?  Charlie Sheen or David Lee Roth?  Charlie Sheen.  Mm-hmm.  Charlie Sheen.  Mm-hmm.  I don't think there's anyone you could really say is worse than Charlie Sheen.  I've listened to a few of the listeners' podcasts. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And I'll tell you this much.  Mm-hmm.  Charlie Sheen worse than the listeners' podcasts that I have tuned into.  At least they're, like, trying.  They know the concept, at least.  They know the concept.  Whether they pull it off or not is something to be seen.  And they turn on their podcast with some kind of plan.  Right.  You know?  This is really bad.  I guess we don't have to tell the people.  I think they're smart enough to understand that.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Charlie Norrell's Norlington List.  Oh, God.  I'm getting flashbacks. 
[00:44:00]  This is awful.  Because I did the simulcast.  Mm-hmm.  But I really wasn't able to pay attention to the show much.  I just saw little moments and stuff and jumped on it.  And as he was babbling, I'd be babbling.  And then I'd stop and listen in a little more.  So I had to go back the next day and actually watch it for this program to be able to know what I'm talking about.  Multitasking.  It was, yeah.  You're simulcasting, then you've got to listen, then you've got to watch it again for the other show.  I had to watch the show, yeah, for this show. 
[00:44:30]  And watching it the second time and really paying attention to what was going on was literally painful.  I was cringing.  I was turning and looking at Melissa at some points, just going like, making that ugh face.  What's worse, listening to this or the bra bombing?  All right.  On a personal level, I have to say bra bombing because it was, you know, duh.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  But then again, that's many years ago for us.  What was Charlie Sheen doing fucking 12 years ago or whatever it was? 
[00:45:00]  12, probably longer now.  What was I going to say?  Ah, whatever.  Let's get into the Gnarls-Gnarlington list.  I like to call this list the, um, the Gnarls-Gnarlington list.  Everyone say it.  Everyone say Gnarls-Gnarlington.  Everyone say it.  Gnarls-Gnarlington.  Yeah, no, no, no.  We were past that.  We were past that.  I gave it to that one.  Oh, and let's, um, let's spend a little money on some air conditioning, maybe. 
[00:45:30]  No, that's flop sweat.  Winning.  So, um, at the top of our, uh, Gnarls-Gnarlington list,  Reginald Martinez-Jackson.  Gnarls-Gnarlington.  Yes, of course.  Otherwise known as Mr. October, Reggie, and Jackson.  Gnarls-Gnarlington.  Yeah, Gnarls-Gnarlington.  And the drinking on this was crazy, too.  Because of Gnarls-Gnarlington.  It's like he's trying to make a catchphrase.  So, any catchphrase.  He's the king of the catchphrase. 
[00:46:00]  He really is.  I'll give him that.  He can whip up a catchphrase.  I like the people that are still drinking the Charlie Sheen Kool-Aid, uh,  when you see him on, on Twitter.  And if you go to his, uh, his podcast, uh, on Ustream and look through it  and look at the chat room, it's, it's just people,  yeah, Charlie, winning!  And it's like, what, are you really saying winning?  And you're serious?  To be fair, all us, uh, all us Twitter people,  we, yeah, we were fucking jumping on his back,  hoping to get a few followers off it.  I'm not gonna lie to you.  But.  And I got a few out of it. 
[00:46:30]  But, it's like, you know when to,  you know when it's over.  I'm backing out.  You know when it's over.  I'm backing out.  I don't want to know who the first celebrity that he's following,  like, the people that he's following,  who's the first one that's gonna block Charlie Sheen?  Like, cause the big thing is, who, who is he getting?  He just got Conan O'Brien, I guess.  Well, real celebrities,  unfortunately, we're not in that category, I guess.  I know.  Uh, they're all about the kissing the ass.  It would be really funny.  They're gonna continue kissing his ass,  even though it's so, 
[00:47:00]  it's so obvious that this has turned the corner.  But not many people are gonna be telling you that today.  Not many.  I watched the SNL parody that they did, uh,  Was it good?  Saturday night.  I haven't checked it out yet.  On, uh, SNL.  It was, uh, it was pretty goddamn funny.  Yeah.  Pretty funny.  The Fallon one was hilarious.  Fallon did a great one with the, uh,  the perfume, the scent.  Fucking hilarious.  That's the, uh,  Yeah, right there.  They're showing it on MSNBC.  Uh, yeah, he's doing a little talk show  and Gaddafi's on it and shit like that.  It was pretty funny. 
[00:47:30]  Uh, but, uh, then,  Right after that,  I watched the Charlie Sheen show.  And I couldn't make the difference.  It was, it was a parody.  Like, watching the actual show  became a parody of him.  I would assume,  without even watching the SNL,  that it was, it was,  it was like,  they could do it with their eyes closed.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Because this is so easy to make fun.  It wrote itself.  It, uh, it really did.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Uh, Gnarles, Gnarlington.  Uh, the Gnarles, Gnarlington list. 
[00:48:00]  Uh,  We're also gonna,  we're also gonna GG our way to  Todd Zeal.  Gnarles.  Absolute Gnarles.  Gnarlington.  Gnarly.  And, um,  somebody talk to him afterwards.  And, of course,  my dear friend,  and if they ever, like,  make this movie,  the new, uh,  face of Willie Mays Hayes,  uh, Mr. Tony Todd.  Gnarles.  What did he gnarly do?  And, uh,  well,  here's kind of a big name 
[00:48:30]  that I can, like,  after I say it,  I just gotta go like that,  but then where others  put it in the drawer,  I just,  I'm gonna eat it.  Um.  What is he saying?  Gnarles.  Gnarly.  Gnarly.  And then,  wait a minute,  wait a minute,  wait a minute.  There's another,  there's another,  there's one more,  there it is.  Who's,  who's this guy?  Me.  Bye.  Gnarled.  Gnarly.  Uber.  Gnarled.  Gnarly.  Gnarly.  You got it.  He's just not interesting  unless he's on his, 
[00:49:00]  uh,  his,  uh,  drugs and booze.  It's just  embarrassingly bad.  It's so fucking hard  to,  to listen to and watch.  All I kept thinking is,  what happened to that guy  that was in platoon?  Not what happened to the guy  that was in platoon.  What happened to that guy  that was on TV,  a mere five days ago?  Yeah.  But even that one was,  like his character  is a saner,  funny Charlie Sheen.  Right.  The Alex Jones interview,  that was only a week ago.  Yeah,  yeah,  that guy, 
[00:49:30]  if that guy did the podcast,  it would be a great watch.  But he's just crazy.  I'm like,  what happened to the guy  that we thought  was really talented?  Like,  I,  I,  I watched a platoon  or Wall Street  and you're like,  that's a talented guy.  Yeah.  And then you see him  and he's like,  oh,  oh,  he's just another one  of these L.A.  douchebags.  Just hanging out.  Thinking he's better  than he is.  As far as this goes,  I don't know the first thing  about him,  but I mean,  when he puts this out there  for the world to critique. 
[00:50:00]  I think we can  pretty much gauge  what he's all about  by what he's done  in the past few weeks.  Yeah.  You think?  I'm thinking just L.A.,  entitled L.A. douchebag  with people that have  just been laughing  and having good times  with him  for quite a while  and,  you know.  All right.  Charlie ends the show  with a poem  and his catchphrase.  Is this good?  Whew.  The poem.  He wrote the poem,  by the way.  It was in a book  that  Peace of My Mind, 
[00:50:30]  I think it was called  or something.  It was a book  he wrote years ago  full of poems.  Actually,  people bought it?  He said no.  He was actually,  the only bit of  self-deprecating humor  was the fact that he said  it sold like six copies.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Everybody pay attention.  It's important.  It's called  The Big White Phone.  In the twisted times  of a running game  where floodwaters  raised coffins from pain,  where the worms  of freedom  have all gone insane,  I plucked them  or sucked them  from the heart  of my brain.  When the edge  of confusion  appears in disarray, 
[00:51:00]  it's an act of illusion,  dead babies would say.  When the clock's  final ticking  exposes your day,  it's your balls  will be clipping  in the dock of your bay.  When leaders ring true  in the eye of the mass,  their blood turns cold blue  while the dogs  eat the grass.  Their painful decay  shoves a snake  up your ass.  The act of delay  they promise will pass.  Until we find  through true release  the volume of our moan.  I'm just reminded  that I hate fucking poems.  Poetry stinks.  You have to figure out  what it really means  and I have no time 
[00:51:30]  for that.  What did he say?  I'm like just annoyed now.  Was someone out there  enjoying the poem?  Did I just fuck it up  for everybody?  No, no, no.  It's another minute.  Do you want to deal  with this?  I heard it.  They pack our bags  with sun and peace  while their children  sleep alone.  When these acts of truth  arrive in time  please read them  high in tone.  I'll be heaving bile  on a vicious style  as I talk  to the big white phone.  Love it.  Very beautiful.  Love it.  Crowd loves it. 
[00:52:00]  Cheers.  You're getting  a clap from the chat room.  Crowd loves it.  All those guys  saying the crowd  loves it or whatever  Charlie should have said  what did I just say there?  Yeah, yeah.  And he wouldn't have got  one fucking explanation  for that poem.  I don't know.  Right.  Jack be nimble.  Jack be quick.  Did you do  Charlie Sheen dice?  I was doing  Charlie Dice Sheen  because he read a poem  so I just thought  Charlie Dice Sheen.  Okay.  Yeah, so it was like  Jack and Jill  went up the hill  both with a buck  and a quarter.  Jill came down  with 250. 
[00:52:30]  Duh.  Duh.  And then the other  way around too.  Right.  It's like  hey, it's tiger blood  and I got Adonis DNA  in my banana juice.  Guz, guz, guz.  Guz, winning.  Winning.  Guz.

[00:54:30]  I've just  joined team troll  yeah I like team troll  let's start team troll today  team troll  because I can't get behind that  and a lot of people are saying  look man give him a break  it's his first show  you remember your first show  well when we did our first show  we were under the radar  no one gave a fuck  the problem is  he's got such a buzz out there  and so many people tuning in  that you gotta hit him hard  and right between the eyes  right  because most of those people  not most  but it's gonna be a drastic drop off  as the week goes  you watch  and I'll put  mark my words on that 
[00:55:00]  I'll put our first show against that  duh  duh  I absolutely would  the first show me and Ant did  fucking kills that one  if you don't like what you see here  get the funk out  duh  winning  we had some tiger blood  back then didn't we  we had some tiger something  yes  piss  that was tiger shit  Mr. Sheen  with all due respect  that was tiger shit  yeah  I don't know what that was  but he didn't really make use  of the visual medium  no  he could have done that 
[00:55:30]  with a microphone  and no video  and he's gotta be doing  some edgy shit  yeah  and if he wants to go after  Nancy Grace and Dr. Drew  he hit very softly  yeah back it up  he's got goddesses  doing absolutely nothing  wearing  wearing stuff  that they could  pretty much  go to church in  yeah  pretty much  they should be all  gussied up  he's got kids  that he wants to  get back in his house  so that's fucking  stopping him  from doing stuff  he can't do drugs  he can't drink  he can't have the people  in the same room 
[00:56:00]  drinking  yeah  so what the fuck  are you watching  in the end  he can't go after  the two and a half men guys  because it's obvious  now he wants to  work it out  with those guys  that's why he shut up  about him  and like I said  if he just would  tell an interesting story  he's Charlie Sheen  he's got great stories  I bet  but  you know what  incapable  yeah  yeah  yeah  you're absolutely right  because I'm thinking  all the stuff  that I wish he could do  obviously he can't do  but he still  he still has some stuff  he could possibly do  and yeah  start telling some  Hollywood stories  fucking Hollywood 
[00:56:30]  you know  doing coke  and all that shit  like tell us  some fucking stories  of what was going on  and stop making believe  the goddess  at any moment  is going to blow you  because that ain't happening  it ain't happening  that's why Brie left  she needed  she needed some action  I'm thinking  she needed some cock  you know  and that's my take on that  yeah  and then she went back  to get you know  a little more fame  god  sorry but I'm done  done  I can't  I can't be on the  the trolley scene bandwagon 
[00:57:00]  anymore  yeah  done  one guy's like  oh really  you guys continue  to talk about him though  yeah because this just  happened on Saturday  if a train  fucking derailed  and wrecked  we talk about that  same thing  duh  and this is  this is not a train wrecker  anymore  yeah  train wrecker anymore  I actually felt myself  feeling a little sad  for him  really  which was weird  because I never  feel that way  but as I was  watching it and stuff  and thinking  like he must have 
[00:57:30]  been done  said check it  you know  trolls beware  and then signed off  and then there he is  just in his house  with those people  and you think like  what is he doing  yeah  like is he just  is he like  going yeah  that was great  everyone's saying  yeah that was great  are they going  yeah I gotta cut out  Charlie  he's lost  like he does  seem very lost  he's lost  and this is  this is one of those  but he's Charlie  or does he just  go upstairs to his  kitchen and make a  cook a chicken video 
[00:58:00]  what does he do  at least you're still  fucking partying  he can't party  it's driving him nuts  he can't party  I know  now you know why  he's one of those  party guys  because when the  alcohol and drugs  are gone  what does he really have  he blinked  and he's cured  yeah he cured  himself  but this is one  of those where  it happens in pop  culture  we all know this  where it's a big  huge spike  everyone is all  the fuck in  they're like  absolutely  I'll do the 
[00:58:30]  Charlie Sheen thing  I'll follow him  on Twitter  I'll check out  the Ustream  yeah I'll  walk around my  office doing  Charlie Sheen  catchphrases  yes we're all  doing that  I'm guilty of it  we all are  but now we're  at this point  at the top  of that peak  the precipice  and now you're  going to see it  drop drastically  the spike  this was not a  slow build  this was a  the spike  one of those  drastic spikes  a spike that  could really hurt  you if it hit  your hiney  yeah  that type of  spike  or wear a  tuxedo 
[00:59:00]  for a  sign of  of course  see if  Charlie Sheen  at least I  was prepared  I wore a  tuxedo  look I know  Ann a little  bit  he was  he was  fucking around  with everybody  by wearing a  tux you  assholes  it was a  gala event  for a big  Hollywood star  why wouldn't  you wear a  tuxedo  you'd be crazy  not to  I say  of course  you did that  to kind of  mock the whole  fucking thing  it was fun  I kind of  liked it  and by the way  I just  had like  regular pants  on  oh did you  yeah because  I'm not  standing up  who cares  and sneakers  yeah  I think I

[01:00:30]  is that what  you want to hear  yes I'm jealous  of course I am  I'm more  stunned  but I shouldn't  underestimate  people  what are you  stunned at  I'm stunned  that it really  did pick up  that fast  and we're  kind of seeing  what this  social networking  is all about  but he hit  on something  it was great  yeah  but unfortunately  he can't sustain  it is where  we're at now  yeah that's a  rough one  he can't sustain  it 
[01:01:00]  amazing though  I think the  PR department  around here  if they were  smart  Mars  yes Mars  is he the  head of the  PRs  he is the  head of PR  I mean PR  if they were  smart enough  they would get  this audio out  yeah  Opie and Anthony  radio experts  critique Charlie  critiquing Charlie  we could have  sound bites all  over the internet  today  please  let's get that  done  Simon Rex was 
[01:01:30]  there at  who  Simon Rex  from MTV  fame  really  he was one  of the guys  in the background  I had no idea  the great Simon  Rex  I don't know  who those  fucking people  were  what did you  think of  Sirius XM's  Tiger Blood  Radio  let's move on  to  somebody else  what happened  nothing  I didn't say  anything  what happened  what happened  I didn't say  anything  I'll say 
[01:02:00]  this much  I had no  desire to  tune it in  I heard  they used  some of  our audio  which is  nice  which hopefully  pumped it up  a little bit  really  but it did  get a little  promotion on  E  oh it did  I was watching  E and they  were you know  E all things  Charlie Sheen  yeah they were  talking about  how Sirius XM  was doing  Tiger Blood  Radio  I had no  interest in that  did they have  a guy doing  live shit  at least  or was it  just  I wouldn't  know  didn't even  pass it  by  you know 
[01:02:30]  that's what  satellite is all  about those  different people  can tune into  different things  and sometimes  you might never  hit on a station  and other times  you share  commonalities with  certain other  people of course  sure sure  never know  I had dumb  videos to make  and phones to  buy  and glasses to  get unfortunately  fuck  Andrew in  Virginia  hey what's  going on guys  I just wanted  to see if you  guys seen that  documentary called  The Wild and  Wonderful Whites  of West Virginia  of course 
[01:03:00]  well I'm so  glad you listened  to our show  we've discussed  that fine documentary  yeah  I do listen to  your show  I never heard  you guys know  it's a joke  relax brother  Anthony loves  white trash  and it's fucking  the whitest  trash you can  get  that is some  white trash  going on there  man  amazing  it's on  Showtime 2  meaning T-O-O  I always thought  of Showtime 2  the number 2  but it's not  and we have  the only reason  I took your call  Johnny Knoxville  is calling in  today to promote  Jackass on Blu-ray  and we could talk  about that documentary 
[01:03:30]  because that was  his project  yeah  him and Jeff  Tremaine or whatever  I loved it by the way  brother I'm just  fucking with you  I thought it was  one of the better  documentaries I've seen  in a really long time  I've watched it like  three times in the last  week it's fucking  ridiculous  that's pretty cool  yeah  what was your  favorite part  either the fucking  badass little  fucking kid  or the  fucking  what's her name  Bo Cephas  Bo Cephas  what is  the kid is just  that little  the guy that got 
[01:04:00]  shot  the part where  he said he  pulled his face  right we asked  for one part  where he pulled  his face back  well that was  the sickest  description I've  ever heard in my  life I think  the guy got shot  in the face  and he didn't die  and then he had  how did he say it  he had to pull  his face back up  to see where the  eye hole was  in his own face  so he could see  again  holy shit  and how about  the bitch with  the  my name's  Sue Bob  I'm the  sexiest one  in the family 
[01:04:30]  yeah that was a  good part where  she was not even  close to sexy  but in her mind  she thinks she's  really sexy  but maybe she is  sexy compared  comparatively  speaking  like for the  town  what year was  that made  only a couple  years ago  was it  because I'm  wondering if  that little  kid is in  prison yet  because that  little kid  was so  destined to  just be  exactly what  the rest of  them are  white trash  in trouble  being a father  that depressed  the shit out  of me because  you see that  that kid doesn't  even have a  chance  not a chance  in hell  like his future 
[01:05:00]  is already  made  this guy won't  shut up  holy fuck  what Andrew  what do you  want  where's the  hang up  button  fuck you  guys  fuck us  now we're  assholes  we're doing  a show  and you're  just yapping  over everybody  well obviously  Andrew had  something way  better than  what we were  going to say  god we're  in the middle  of a conversation  I have so  much confidence  today after  watching Charlie  Sheen I don't  know what it  is  Charlie Sheen's  played out  what were you  going to say  he'll be on  Dr. Drew's  show soon enough 
[01:05:30]  no he won't  what do you got  Andrew  that's it  well the lineup  for Celebrity Rehab  is pretty impressive  they're getting  some biggies  that's it Andrew  Amy Fisher  doing it  yeah Amy Fisher  is doing it  I guess she's  addicted to the  sex maybe  really  what else would  she be addicted  to  is that her  ploy to get  on this  come on  I think so  that's the new  one  you have to  have one  that's addicted  to the  sex  is she still  with the  Joey  buttafuoco  look alike  I ain't saying  a word about  that guy  that guy  scared me  when he was 
[01:06:00]  in  did he scare  you Danny  he was a  what was he  ex law enforcement  honestly I don't  really remember  he was intimidating  there's not many  people that come in  here that are  intimidating  he was certainly  one of those guys  because he was a  big burly fucking  believe it or not  there are times  I'm not intimidated  by the big burly fuck  yeah  yeah I don't know  but there was something  else about him  that certainly  I was intimidated  about  yeah  he did  he was like  ex law enforcement  in some capacity  I don't know  what the fuck  it was  can we talk about  the whites for a second  because that guy  derailed us 
[01:06:30]  yeah he totally did  the other part I liked  was the family  that said  fuck this  and moved to  Minnesota  and now they're  trashing their  relatives  and their uncles  and their nieces  and their nephews  just fucking  making fun of them  they had to get away  right  I love that  I love the  the woman that  just gave birth  and was snorting  whatever she was  snorting  some people said  it was crystal meth  but then other people  said it was just  the painkiller  they were giving her  for the fact  that she just gave birth  and she only knows  how to do painkillers  one way 
[01:07:00]  I think it was  I think she was  snorting the painkillers  yeah  crunching them up  and snorting it  but I wouldn't  and then the casual  then the casual  conversation  when they took  the baby away  from her  and the mom  was it  because I can't  really tell  because they're  all the same age  I know they all  look the same  like the grandmother  the mother  and the daughter  they all  wait does that make sense  they all look  about the same age  so I don't know  so bear with me  and that's not a compliment  they all look like  the grandmother  and uh  she's bumming  and crying her eyes out  because she couldn't  go home with her baby  and then the one woman 
[01:07:30]  goes  they probably found  drugs in her  yeah  all casual  like that's  yeah like  oh that happens  like oh well  we're used to that  in this family  might have the croup  go to rehab  get yourself together  so you can get  your daughter back  and then  trying to get  the grandma higher  at her 80th  or 85th birthday  party  yeah she didn't want  to smoke the reefers  and she was getting  all pissed off  yeah that's cute  and then the  then that  that fucking  little kid  drove me nuts 
[01:08:00]  really  how old was he  like 6 or 7  8 years old  something like  going  fuck Dennis  I'm gonna go over  to Dennis' house  and shoot him  mama  shoot him  and you know  he will someday  yes of course  of course  it was  destined to be a criminal  it's an amazing documentary  if you haven't checked it out yet  yeah  the whites of  what is it called  the whites of  West Virginia  and Johnny Knoxville  involved with that  producer  yeah  I was hoping more of  an update at the end  of the film  because you knew  you were gonna get  the update  like this guy's  doing this  this guy's here 
[01:08:30]  maybe we could get it  from Johnny Knoxville  that would be nice  that would be nice  yar  alright  I saw the jackass 3D too  so I loved it  I'll be able to talk  to him about that  I fucking loved it  out on DVD  when?  we got it already  so  yeah I know  so I didn't care  tomorrow maybe  probably tomorrow  if he's calling  today  that makes sense  comes with the  old school 3D glasses  only one way  Charlie could come back  Hot Shots Part 3 
[01:09:00]  I don't think so  and someone is saying  there were a few  white movies  that came out  before this one  so maybe I have to  go back and watch  some of the other ones  oh yeah I think they did  they've kind of been  like a news story  over the years  another favorite part  was the kid that  was in prison  waiting for his  sentencing  oh yeah  I don't know who  he was related to  obviously he's a white  and he was delusional  thinking ah the judge  likes me  I'll probably get  like I forgot 
[01:09:30]  time served  time served  he thought he was  getting out  a little probation  maybe I'll do a year  in jail  and they fucking  threw the book  at him  and of course  he held up  the whole town  basically  shot his own uncle  in the face  and then held up  the town  a bunch of dummies  he held up  the entire town  and he was  shooting at cops  and this guy's  thinking  oh I'm just  going to get  time served  that's fine  maybe a little  probation  yeah I wouldn't  worry about it  Mousy  people liked  Mousy  like you said 
[01:10:00]  I don't even  know which one  is which  half the time  they all look  like the old  raggy  I think Mousy  was the one  that got out  of jail  and just wanted  dick right away  and went to  her ex-husband's  house even though  she was away  for she was away  long enough  where the guy  was pretty much  moving on with  his life  and he had  another wife  or girlfriend  I forget  and that  didn't even  matter in her  fucking mind  she went over  and got her  ex-husband  to fuck her  she wanted  some dick  right  and then  Hank Williams  the third  fuck  can we play  Hank Williams  the third  going into 
[01:10:30]  break a little  he's a little  fucked up  huh  I hear his  family's not  a big fan  of him  probably not  he's like a  rebel in that  family  he's the outlaw  I want him  on the show  bad  and I want  him to play  because some  of that music  did you like  that music  I know it's  not your genre  it's not my  cup of joe  but do you get  into that kind  of thing  not really  even when it's  in a movie  nice like that  no  I really can't  get into that  really  yeah it's like  too alien to  me  yeah  not really  all right  we'll break  certainly I got 
[01:11:00]  a minute and  24 minutes of  audio from  another podcast  that blows  Charlie Sheen's  podcast  away  and Bobby  Knight saying  chicken shit  on TV  you're looking  at breasts  you're healthier  we'll do that  worst rap battle  contestant  maybe we'll do  that  Troy Kwan's  song  we're not  doing that  we're not  doing that  come on  that's great  what's  Troy's got  two songs  I guess he did  no no  that was  DJ Steve  Porter does 
[01:11:30]  Troy Kwan's  Charlie Sheen  song  he got all  mad on  Twitter  because we  didn't like  the song  did you see  that  yeah  dude  to the guy  that got  mad  I guess  it's DJ  Steve Porter  get it back  to him  I don't know  the rap world  so relax  told him to  lighten up  Francis  we quite  frankly  didn't get  it but  maybe it's  a good  song  I'm not  going to  sit here  and make  believe I'm  a rap  expert  we played  it we  didn't like  it  but then  again we  don't know  rap  just lighten  up man  you got your  song on the  radio which  probably turned  some people  on to your  shit  can't take  any  criticisms  all right

[01:15:00]  this is playing  is there a  an anecdote  a date  an anniversary  let's see  I know that  this day  in  1985  we are the  world  debuted  yes  we are  the world  didn't we do 
[01:15:30]  one of those  we are the  children  oh yeah  we certainly  did  oh fuck  we should  what was ours  for  what was the  cause  just to do  I don't know  why  wait cause I think  that was an  anniversary too  was it  what was our  oh because they  remade it  right  they redid it  I mean redid it  sorry  25th anniversary  that was a year ago  already  yeah  we did ours  cause of the  25th anniversary  yeah cause now  it's like the  26th  I thought we did  ours because  they redid  the original  I think they did  for the 25th 
[01:16:00]  anniversary  and that's why  we did it  so it's actually  26th anniversary  yeah 26 years  ago  they did the  and the Blind  Melon  I don't know  Eric was just  feeling a little  Gay  a little gay  a little gay  I liked the  I liked the  Blind Melon  were you into  the Blind Melon  well they only  had like two  songs  they had two  maybe three  right  that stupid  B-Girl  I know they  had Tones of  Home  the one we  just played  and there  might have  been a third  how old's  the B-Girl  now  Galaxy was on  their second 
[01:16:30]  album  which is a  really good  song  no you know  it  yeah play it  right now  might  might but  probably not  B-Girl  stupid B-Girl  it kind of does  this thing first  and then it  jumps in  what is this  shit  this is just  an intro  I hate this  you're gonna  like it though  this is supposed  to sound like  a New Orleans  funeral dirge 
[01:17:00]  or something  I sort of  remember this  song  yeah  doesn't mean  anything  though  okay  goodbye to  you  nah this  I'm not  yeah I kind of  remember this  I don't know  if it was a  hit though  Travis  no it was  definitely a  hit  it was  definitely a  hit  you're saying  it's gonna  start  in like five  seconds  okay  yeah this  sounds like  a hit  did the  radio edit  have this  no the radio  edit definitely  did not have  this on there 
[01:17:30]  come on  here it goes  I kind of  remember this  from AAF  do you remember  this song  yeah I kind of  remember this  playing  I kind of  remember this  god this  takes you right  back to the  dumb 90s  doesn't it  that's what  b-girl looks  like now  holy shit  she turned 
[01:18:00]  into a  looker  that's a  that's a  good picture  Danny just  gave the  where she  started and  where she's  at today  that's a  big improvement  look at that  alright she's  still a little  chubby  but she's  chubby cute  though  and she still  has youth  on her side  you'd fuck  her  fuck yeah  yeah you look  and go  nah yeah  no problem  with that  and to say  you just  fucked the  b-girl  yeah how  many guys  have said  that  fuck the  b-girl  I know  right  dude  fuck the  b-girl  fuck the  b-girl  last night  how old  a gal 
[01:18:30]  is she  now  gotta be  20  something  how many  years ago  it was  b-girl  I know  that's a  while  don't even  tell me  I don't  want to  be depressed  today  92  93  is b-girl  94  93  93 was  b-girl  wow  that's  17  18  years  ago  holy  shit  she was  about  what  so  b-girl  is about  30  now  b-girl  is 28  she's 28  wow  did she do  anything else  or just  b-girl 
[01:19:00]  well she  reprised her  b-girl role  for the  bedrock  anthem  by weird  al yankovic  she's had  some acting  career since  93  yeah  yeah  she was  on an  episode of  Tracy  Takes  On  oh my  god  an episode  two episodes  of ER  uh-huh  one  two Reno  911's  and she  played the  role of  teenage fan  in Balls of  Fury  wow  teenage fan  yep  so she 
[01:19:30]  almost made  it in  Hollywood  yeah  she was  big as  the b-girl  I remember  MTV dragged  her out  and everything  certainly  alright  like that  little fucking  Jeremy kid  they dragged  him out too  all those little  kids that were  in those 90s  videos  the Nirvana kid  the Nirvana kid  the Nirvana kid  recently they  showed him again  yeah  he's about  uh  17 or 18  now I think  what the  kid with his  dick hanging  out in the pool  oh there's  there's  yeah that was  the one I  just saw  that's what  he  a goofy  looking  fucking  but he 
[01:20:00]  looks exactly  the same  the nose  and the eyes  are exact  that's creepy  dumb kid  yeah  of course  the baby  under the water  for the  Nevermind cover  that kid's  about 17  or 18  now  oh Uncle  Paul  well the  album was  released in  91 so he's  gotta be a  little older  than that  oh my god  are you  serious  so you know  they'll drag him  back out this  year it's  20th anniversary  oh my god  so okay  so he's  20  possibly  21  was he 
[01:20:30]  afraid to  show his  dick in  that picture  where he  reprised his  little role  in the pool  that's probably  the same size  why would you  do the shot  with the  bathing suit  on you  don't have  to show  your dick  because how  that was  shot you  could almost  like not  have the  dick part  or they  could photoshop  that shit  out easily  it'd look a  little weird  though  you can't  do the  same shot  with a  bathing suit  on if  you're  gonna do  it  you gotta  do it  right  he probably  didn't want  to  he probably  doesn't even  like Nirvana  did they  ever ask  him if 
[01:21:00]  he even  liked the  fucking  band  who the fuck  are these  guys  he was  forced to  be  the poster  child for  Nirvana  and he  probably  doesn't even  like them  alright let's  play this audio  this was  just amazing  scared a lot  of people  you scared  a lot of  people  Saturday  I don't  know why  is there a  set up to  this or  should I  just play  it  my phones  were screwing  up but I  didn't know  it I thought  it was the  listener's fault  okay  because I'm  always  very very  eager to  blame the  listeners 
[01:21:30]  and the  viewers  and of course  we're talking  about live  from the  compound  also known  as LFTC  yeah  Scorch has  his PFGTV  I just thought  of that  it's like I'll  never call it  that now because  of the acronym  thing I hate the  acronym  yeah but when you  tweet LFTC  I'm like okay  he's doing LFTC  yeah  you only have  140 characters  what are you  supposed to do  with that  that's gonna  waste up a lot  of your fucking  characters  so continue  with LFTC  people know  what it means  LFTC  yeah LFTC  so you 
[01:22:00]  pulled the gun  on your audience  basically  well  it's  a lot of people  noticed that you  fucking had that  finger right on  that trigger  but I didn't  no  absolutely not  I wouldn't even  do that  was it loaded  no it wasn't  and I had  my finger was  on the trigger  guard next to it  yeah it's the  perspective  you see like the  finger from  directly dead on  so it looks like  my knuckle  and that I'm  turned through  the trigger  guard  but no  it's off  the trigger  guard  and I'm  pointing it  at a camera  in my house  I'm playing 
[01:22:30]  a part  don't you  understand  people  are you  of course  are you  yeah  fantastic  look in my  eyes and tell me  you're playing  a part  I'm nothing  but safety  you look at  my  you look at  you can't even  look this way  you look at  my  your safety  record  my method  actor  you look at  my range  videos and  everything  safety first  safety first  that's what I  say but you  know something  when somebody's  when I think  someone's fucking  up on the air  and you rip out  a fucking  iron on them  and hold it  to the camera 
[01:23:00]  lens  it gets people's  attention  right  Charlie Sheen  should have  done  and this is  a minute and  24 seconds  of audio  that is just  way better than  what Charlie Sheen  did over the  weekend  it sure is  anyway what do  you have for  this evening  did you watch  the Charlie Sheen  Sheen's Corner  with a K  oh she said  Borefest  yeah  oh good for  you guys man  so you were  on it early  oh yeah  it was terrible  we knew right  as it was 
[01:23:30]  happening  it was bad  and you can  hear now  that's a scary  point of view  to take  because the  whole world  is in love  with this guy  and we certainly  were in love  with him last  week  but I hate  to use the  phrase  because I think  the phrase  jump the shark  has jumped the  shark  exactly  if that makes  sense  but he jumped  the shark  with that  Ustream show  it was done  we knew when  we were watching  it's like  that's why  I was goofing  on it  like it was  the biggest  thing ever  to happen  in the world  the grandiose 
[01:24:00]  introduction  to that show  I put it  together on  After Effects  it is so  over the top  like an action  movie trailer  and it keeps  going and going  and then at  one point  it just says  something like  holy shit  and like  in big like  fucking graphics  that are  motion blur  to it  and orchestra  music  because it  is just a goof  the whole thing  is to goof  on it  but you can  hear the echoing  going on in the  background of this  and that's  annoying me  and I think  the guy has 
[01:24:30]  his volume  turned up  and he's not  listening to the  phone call  he's listening  to himself  on the radio  the computer  whatever  so I'm  getting mad  alright  I gotta start  over  so let's  start over  I'll shut  up  anyway  what do  you have  for this  evening  did you  watch the  Charlie Sheen  Sheen  Corner  with a K  alright  he's to  everyone's  Ron Bennington  what's that  seriously  don't  listen 
[01:25:00]  don't listen  to what's  coming out  of whatever  listening device  you're listening  to  aside from  your phone  just listen  to me  talking in  your phone  and answer  it when  that happens  okay  oh my god  oh my god  is it  look  motherfucker  look  motherfucker  talk  talk  you  fucking  fuck  are you  sure  so  to fill  in the  visual  is that  when the  gun was  pointed at 
[01:25:30]  the camera  yeah  and I love  how your  girl is like  this is no  big deal  oh no  she knows  you pull  the gun  and you're  pointing it  at basically  the listeners  pointing at  the camera  and she's  people said  they literally  ducked  when they  were watching  they were  watching it  they ducked  she's not  even phased  by it  at all  no  that's  awesome  it was  I was  angry  talk  talk  you  fucking  fuck  are you  sure  it's 
[01:26:00]  their  problem  and not  ours  holy  shit  I'm  talking  listen  to the  phone  not the  computer  your phones  are fucked  no they're  not  I hear  is there  something wrong  oh maybe  it's my  fault  can you  hear me  yes I  can hear  you  there we  go much  better  holy crap  wait what  now you  hear me  oh maybe  it's my  fault  okay look  I didn't  mean to  alright 
[01:26:30]  hold on  not hold on  I hung up  I didn't  mean to  pull a  gun on  you  by the  way  it was  my  fault  I made  an honest  mistake  by pulling  a gun  on you  I guess  there's  something wrong  with the  phone  oh what  an asshole  and there  you have it  in a minute  24 seconds  you get  better  fucking  content  than  that stupid  Sheen  shit  wow that's 
[01:27:00]  great  that was  almost  sounded like  the dance  motherfucker  dance  that Charlie  Sheen did  in Platoon  so it  almost fits  that whole  Charlie Sheen  thing that was  going on  the screen  cap of  viewpointing  the gun  is just  terrific  I'm in  a tuxedo  some people  said I  look like  a retarded  James Bond  yeah  you got the  tuxedo on  the gun's  pointed right  at the camera  and that's  your shooting  face  that's fucking  scary dude  that would  I guess if  somebody home  invaded that's 
[01:27:30]  what they would  look at  that's what  they would  see  sans the  tuxedo  because I  rarely wear it  around the  house  sans  sometimes  I  do  sans  tuxedo  yeah  but yeah  I had a  nice Charlie  Sheen montage  going behind  me all  clips of  his movies  and everything  a big  intro  a lot of  graphics  and clever  things that  just really  have no  place in  such an  amateurly  run  podcast  it looks  if you're  passing by  it oh 
[01:28:00]  it looks  very  professional  it's  terrific  but then  you see  some  fucking  lunatic  with broken  phones  pulling  heat  out  on  people  when is  this  dumb  place  going to  wake up  Sirius XM  and you  know  every time  I have to  say Sirius XM  I turn  so I can  read it  somewhere  it's not  even in  my brain  that we  work here  when are  they going  to wake  up  the whole  world  is going  to this  format  where it's  radio  and TV  at the  same  time  I also  want to  make a  point of  letting  everybody 
[01:28:30]  know  why is  it you  go home  and you  have a  better  set up  than the  bread and  butter  which is  this show  this is  the bread and  butter  and then  obviously  we go off  and do  our silly  little things  on the  side  why is  it when  you do  your thing  on the  side  it looks  better  than this  I don't  understand  when are  they going  to wake  up  this is  where the  whole world  is going  it's a new  thing  they're calling  a television  but it's  not TV  it's radio  with visuals  pictures  it's not 
[01:29:00]  TV  I had  it perfect  trust me  I just want  to say  though  that during  that whole  thing  I was  at every  turn I was  plugging this  program  and Sirius XM  satellite radio  and I was  using specialized  graphics that  night  but I usually  have the  Sirius XM  logo  spinning in the  corner  and I'm  constantly  plugging this  show  and when  it's on  the  channel  I hope  not  I really  hope not  I'll tell  you what  the suits 
[01:29:30]  need to  know  if they're  even listening  I don't even  know if they  listen to our  channel anymore  we just played  a clip from  it  so we just  enhanced our  show  so relax  I didn't  realize at  the time  how fucking  crazy that  sounds  listening back  just screaming  fuck  how many did  you have in  you  well we  were doing  the drinking  game  so it was  every time  Charlie Sheehan  had said  catchphrase  see Charlie  Sheehan  if he would  have pulled  the gun  oh boy  that would 
[01:30:00]  have been  someone said  if he would  have done  that he'd  have been  arrested  you think  probably  because it  probably would  have been  illegal  but once again  making our  point  would have  been brandishing  outside his  house he  probably would  have done  it  making our  point though  he did  nothing  I keep it  legal eagle  but fun  but fun for  everyone  that's right  it's gotta be  fun  nothing wrong  with scaring  the shit  out of your  audience  like I said  people said  they literally  ducked  they were  petrified  but listening  back to that  it does sound  funny  I was a  complete lunatic  Ron Bennington  called and had  that same problem 
[01:30:30]  with the echoey  feedback and I  thought he was  just doing a  bit with me  but his call  was good too  and he brought  up the fact  that Brie  was the one  that had  jerked off  and perhaps  blown Black  Earl  and that kind  of put her  out of the  whole contention  of ever wanting  to be with her  we had a little  discussion  of course  you did  can we play  the Brie Olsen  stuff at 10 o'clock  today  I hope so  I mean one of  the goddesses  has done a lot  of good radio  for us  yeah  she had a crush 
[01:31:00]  on Jimmy  so you got that  audio which was  great  she was really  into Jimmy  Jim Norton  she definitely  jerked off Earl  at least jerked  him off  we think  that we know  and then there  was a Cream  Pie Jones  situation with  her as well  I didn't know  about the Cream  Pie thing  until this very  moment  who's the star  of the Big  Duty video  how did he  pull that off  by the way  I know it's  not probably  hard to get  a blowjob  from her  if Earl  did it  but he didn't 
[01:31:30]  seem like the  guy that would  make a move  I don't remember  how it happened  I think she  said she was  down and you  guys were like  really how  about this one  and she was  like okay  and then it  just kind of  happened  it's just a  sacrificial lamb  yeah like let's  see if she's  talking shit  or if she's  going to really  do it  what a guy  what a guy  it's nice  so I think  at 10 o'clock  today we'll  play some of  that stuff  absolutely  so Brie Olsen  one of  Charlie Sheen's  goddesses  has done some  she's done  way more for us  than she's done  for Charlie Sheen 
[01:32:00]  she just  kind of sits  there in the  background  and does nothing  she's got a  very cute face  oh my god  yeah  so she could  just sit there  and look cute  that's what she  does  she's ridiculously  hot and cute  and I guess  she's not in  the porn business  anymore  no  what'd she do  they keep saying  former porn star  former  huh  yeah  that's a hell  of a face  huh  yeah  boobies aren't 
[01:32:30]  bad either  no  boobies make  you healthier  let's not forget  people  yeah I read  something about  that  yeah we can  play it  it's quick  study says  it's healthy  to look at  breath  all breasts  um  no  I'm going  with no  some of them  are disturbing  and probably  stressful  and bother  and bother  yeah  bothersome  what's a breast  that's disturbing  to you  flapjack  fried egg  flapjack  pancake  breast  old lady 
[01:33:00]  biker  old lady  breasts  I'm not a fan  of the  the deep  freckle  cleavage thing  oh right  right right  a freckle  a freckle  of two  yes  I'm talking  about when  the freckles  start looking  like alligator  skin  yeah  yeah  where it just  takes over  the whole  cleavage  what the fuck  is that  Danny found  a picture  of some  chick with  some awful  flappy tits  and she's just  got them on a plate  she's got them  laying on a plate  in front of her  really disturbing  she didn't have  to bend over 
[01:33:30]  to get them  flat on the plate  on a table  she's sitting  at a  standard sized  table  and the breasts  are flat  on the table  on a plate  if she stood up  oh it photoshopped  I don't know  I don't know  but let's just  hypothetically say  it's for real  if she stood up  her nipples  would be touching  her pelvic bone  that's true  yeah  that's gotta be  photoshopped  that's disgusting  she's got a lot  of chest  and she's too  she's too young  to have them  that much  of a disaster  there's a weird  discoloration  where her tits  would be  sorry my amusing  saggy tit photo 
[01:34:00]  did not meet  your criteria  oh there's a real  one  Jesus  what is that  disgusting  crazy shit  dot com  gets the plug  today  you got a  kind of a  chubby woman  in like  some kind  of jacuzzi  pool thing  giant boobs  that are hitting  the water  you know who's  got an awful  cleavage  Tori Spelling  oh yeah  Tori Spelling's  cleavage is  fucking disgusting  it's so fucking  mangled up  how do you  even get  to the  cleavage  when you  can't stop  looking at 
[01:34:30]  the awful  face  oh I know  some fucking  doctor actually  did that  they fucked  oh well they  pushed them  together  yeah  when you have  the hole  where the  cleavage should be  a divot  there's a divot  above where the  cleavage should be  that's horrible  she must have  had some  major problems  with that  she's not a  good looking  woman at all  no  what the fuck  horse face  oh god  she's all fat  now too  well that was  an old picture 
[01:35:00]  is it  that's probably  when she was  pregnant  oh  she has a few  kids now  two or three  kids now  isn't that great  when your father's  Aaron Spelling  and you could  just be put in  most popular shows  on television  what is the  problem with her  face  because she  looks like she  could be good  looking but then  there's  there's something  tranny like  looking about  but there's one  is it her jaw  yeah she's got a  very masculine  the jaw's weird  that makes  masculine jaw  because she looks  like she's supposed  to be good looking  yeah it looks like 
[01:35:30]  just at the last  minute something  went amiss  something went awry  yeah okay  never mind  don't matter  you can pick  anyone  yeah any picture  she doesn't have  one picture that's  like oh that's  just a bad picture  what is it  is it her jaw  is long  it's thick  it's like fat  is it  yeah like  I can't figure out  what makes her ugly  stab before she  got it fixed  and like  sergeant slaughter  well boobies  are good for all  of us  fellows listen up  a new study says  it's actually healthy 
[01:36:00]  to stare at a  woman's breasts  oh look at this  guy with the  fellows listen up  what about  fellows listen up  what about the  lesbos  fellows  what about the  lesbos getting  healthier by  looking at the  boobs  does that help  fellows listen up  a new study says  it's actually healthy  and what about  some of the  gees that  that actually  stresses them out  looking at the  breasts and they  get heart attacks  although  this guy's fucked up  although the  gees like  breasts  I've heard  gays guys like  breasts because  of some motherly  thing  so they don't 
[01:36:30]  mind the boobs  yeah because  usually you know  the domineering  mother whatever  I don't know  but  then that's  going to be  confusing as  hell to them  yeah yeah  because they  like them  because it  brings them  back to the  mother thing  but that's  why we like  them  because it  brings us  back to those  days too  they're just  they're cushy  but I don't  think gays  like them  for that reason  like wow  this is kind  of hot  to see  and shit  like that  they like  it because  it's  nurturing  it's  nurturing  like I  think when  they hug  their girlfriends  they like 
[01:37:00]  to lay their  head on a  breast or  something like  that  wow that's  fucked up  yeah  well that's  just my  take  you know  I'm a  student of  the gay  why  I don't  know  you should  know a  little bit  about  everything  I had  a gay  richard  dream  the other  night  holy shit  dude  that was  fucked  up  did you  get  all right  go ahead  it was  tree  fort  richard  I had  a dream  did you  have sex  with him  no no  there was  no sex  be honest  was there 
[01:37:30]  some weird  shit going on  it's a dream  I would be  it was a  fucking dream  it was a  dream  I would be  completely  honest  but I'll  let you  know  and then  people go  well that  means you're  gay though  oh really  so when I'm  flying around  like a  unicorn  I'm a  unicorn  in my  dream  winning  winning  I'm a  unicorn  winning  how far  did you  get with  richard  in the  gay  dream  no it  wasn't a  gay  dream  it was a  dream  with gay  richard  it was a  gay  dream  see gay  richard  is dead  you're gonna  hold back  on your  dream  gay richard 
[01:38:00]  died of  the aids  a few  years back  I guess  in 99  2000  something like  that  he died  of the  aids  the ninja  got him  the hiv  the high  five  so to  see him  in a  dream  was weird  and I  hadn't  had any  richer  dreams  I'm not  listening to  you  Danny  has a  great  question  what base  did you  get to  with  richard  no bases  although what  are the bases  let's see  first base  is what  I don't know  what for gay  guys  yeah  yeah  I don't  know 
[01:38:30]  Danny  he wasn't  falling for  it  I was about  to be like  well he gets  kissing  we can all  guess  is fisting  a home run  yeah  is the  fisting  like  I guess  it depends  if you're  the fister  or the fist  how is  fisting  third base  fucking  is always  the home run  so I think  ass fucking  would be  the home run  let's get  this straight  wait a minute  you're crazy  a fist 
[01:39:00]  has to be  like a  grand slam  I'm thinking  in the park  home run  because that's  not easy  to do  that's really  not easy  to do  how are you  fisting  is  what are you  talking about  is like  premature  ejaculation  you really  should have  been out  are we  really  going to  do this  the infield  was in  let's see  let's see  kissing's  got to be  first base  it's always  kissing  for the gays  yeah  what else  would it be 
[01:39:30]  if they got  fisting  as part  of their  thing  then  they got  to get  right  to  cock  sucking  his  first  base  Jesus  Christ  that's a  hell of a  single  you still  got the  penis  in the  hiney  and then  you got  the fisting  so that's  taking up  two bases  right there  for this  radio program  I've covered  a few  gay parades  down  in the  city  and boy  a handshake  for some  people  I've seen  guys just  basically meet 
[01:40:00]  say hi  how you  doing  and then  they're  grabbing  each  other's  dicks  so I  think  some  dick  touching  or dick  grabbing  has to  be  first  base  so first  base  has to  at least  be  way more  aggressive  hands down  the pants  let's not forget  about docking  holy shit  docking is  kind of like  you're stealing  second or  something  that's a  stand up  double  stand up  double  there's  docking  there's  felching  so we  need things  like a  slide  in  I don't  know  man  there's  got to  be  there's  not just 
[01:40:30]  first  base  second  base  there's  a  bunt  there's  a  fucking  blooper  into  the  fucking  center  field  what's  that  rule  when the  ball hits  the ground  on a  third  strike  and you're  allowed to  run  to verse  is that like  if a guy  is straight  and the  gay guy  is going  for it  anyway  he's like  fuck  I'm  going to  touch  his  dick  it's  him  bending  over  to tie  his  shoes  and you  fucking  stick  your  middle  finger  in  his  asshole  hey  he wasn't  ready  he wasn't  looking  fucking  hilarious 
[01:41:00]  let me see  if I can  answer  that  and were  you bummed  out  I didn't  come at  all  and I  wasn't  no I  wasn't  bummed  out  that the  alarm went  off when  it was  getting hot  and heavy  no no I  I wasn't  bummed  out  why would  you bring  a gay  dream  to the  show  it  wasn't  a gay  dream  it was  a dream  with a  gay  guy  that used  to be  a friend  of mine  before I  knew  he was  gay  did you  have  morning  wood  when you  got  no there  was  no  morning  no there 
[01:41:30]  was no  wood  what's  the dream  about  it was  now I  feel like  very much  to it  it was  just  Richard  was there  and I  was there  we were  sitting  in these  like kitchen  chairs  almost  you know  like these  kind of  old  chrome  pipe  with the  with the  fucking  cushions  on them  and shit  like an  old  kitchen  type  chair  and sitting  kind of  like next  to each  other  but a  little  turn  towards 
[01:42:00]  each  other  like  like  at a  like  at a  you know  the chairs  are almost  at a 90  degree  angle  you do  realize  it's  officially  a gay  dream  why  because  they're  sitting  and having  a chat  in some  kitchen  chairs  but now  you're  kind of  slightly  toward  each  other  so that  well  what  would  have  been  not  gay  about  it  facing  each  other  completely  or  sitting  next  to  each  other  looking  at a  wall  no  because  we  were  talking  oh  you  were  talking  yeah  we  were  talking  all  right  so  the  chairs  are  turned  in 
[01:42:30]  and  I'm  thinking  to myself  like  holy  shit  wait  wait  isn't  he  dead  yeah  you're  talking  to  him  like  in my  dream  my  dream  thinking  is  some  people  think  that  you're  actually  talking  to  the  person  through  your  dreams  oh  really  so  you  might  have  been  having  a  conversation  with him  wherever  the  fuck  he  is  that's  creepy  he  obviously  isn't  in  heaven  because  he's  gay  well  no  god  doesn't  like  that  that's  a joke  because  that's  completely  ridiculous  but  so  we're  sitting  boy  if  it's  I'm  gay  just  getting  to  the  seating 
[01:43:00]  arrangement  do you  believe  in that  shit  though  some  people  say  you  can  talk  to  dead  people  through  your  dreams  I've  had  some  weird  ones  with  my  dad  I  don't  believe  in  it  I  don't  know  what  the  fuck  it's  about  it's  kind  of  cool  when  you  see  some  dead  people  in  a  dream  and  you  kind 
[01:43:30]  kitchen  chairs  where  the  chairs  upside  down  that  came  in  a  lot  by  the  way  did  he  have  three  friends  with  him  no one  gets  credit  for that  one  that  one  came  in  a  lot  no  no  we  were  sitting  next  to  each  other  in  the  in  the  chair  in  respective  chairs 
[01:44:00]  and  I was  thinking  he's  dead  what  the  hell  is  he  doing  here  you  know  and  he's  talking  to  me  about  like  that  he's  sick  he's  like  yeah  I'm  sick  and  stuff  and  I  said  yeah  I  know  I  heard  about  that  and  I  said  AIDS  and  then  he  starts  crying  he's  like  crying  in  the  dream  and  he's  like  I  don't  want  to  die  I  don't  want  to  die  from  this 
[01:44:30]  and  then  you  said  you  won't  it'll  probably  be  pneumonia  or  something  yeah  you  don't  die  from  the  AIDS  some  kind  of  side  thing  and  then  he  like  leans  over  the  chair  to  hug  me  and  lean  on  me  to  cry  and  all  I  was  thinking  is  I  think  I  could  get  AIDS  from  them  tears  so  so  so  so  I  didn't  so  I  didn't  I  didn't  reciprocate  with  the  hug  thing  I  kind  of  backed  off  and  he 
[01:45:00]  realized  that  and  sat  back  up  and  kind  of  got  composure  of  himself  and  then  you know  he  turned  into  a  Buick  LeSabre  and  you  know  dreams  and  you  turned  into  a  butterfly  but  it  wasn't  really  and  I  was  driving  from  the  back  seat  and  I  wasn't  friends  is  that  you're  interpreting  this  yeah  well  where's  that  dumb  fuck  shrink  where  what  does  she  have  to  say  about  that  what  do  you  yes  we  were  best  friends  you  guys  were  obviously 
[01:45:30]  good  friends  best  of  friends  you  know  to  get  serious  for  is  that  a  thing  where  I  wasn't  there  to  maybe  help  him  through  his  time  of  need  probably  kind  of  maybe  it  bums  you  out  a  little  bit  but  you  guys  lost  touch  because  you  guys  went  in  different  I  had  some  really  good  friends  that  I  haven't  talked  to  in  so  long  now  and  I  remember  the  days  you  thought  you  would  live  your  lives  together  oh  please  yes  you  buy  the  house  next  to  me  you  are  in 
[01:46:00]  the  same  town  and  man  these  people  are  long  gone  gone  no  I  never  after  I  left  California  and  came  back  here  I  never  looked  at  it  like  oh  my  god  I  miss  my  good  friend  it  was  just  kind  of  like  made  new  friends  sure  no  more  homos  I  don't  think  and  I'm  sure  he  did  the  same  thing  but  he  certainly  did  he  made  some  really  good  friends  apparently  wow  I  would  love  to  know  who  his  enemies  were  oh  thanks  pal  yeah  so 
[01:46:30]  so  but  there's  probably  like  some  weird  dreamy  thing  that  happens  where  those  things  are  connected  in  your  head  and  then  you're  like  oh  what  does  that  mean  does  it  mean  like  like  he  went  to  get  some  kind  of  comfort  from  me  and  I  wasn't  there  maybe  but  maybe  he was  too  scared  to  well  but  not  even  too  scared  we  weren't  even  fucking  friends  at  that  point  we  weren't  friends  I  hadn't  heard  from  I  didn't  know  he  was  dead  for  fucking  eight  years  that's  how 
[01:47:00]  friendly  we  were  I  had no  idea  I  used to  be like  oh  maybe  if  I  go  to  California  it would  be  awkward  if  I  New York  and  said  I  gotta  fucking  pull  out  all  the  stops 
[01:47:30]  here  I  gotta  find  cock  wherever  I  can  I  gotta  get  to  first  base  cock  in  mouth  Jesus  yeah  so  I  don't  know  it's  just  one  of  those  weird  fucking  weird  dreams  but  I  woke  up  and  chuckled  that  was  odd  was  it  creepy  though  yeah  it  was  weird  because  he  was  dead  but  he  was  like  the  age  he  I  knew  him  at  you  were  going  back  in  time  because  I 
[01:48:00]  don't  know  him  at  an  older  age  because  you  were  going  back  in  time  and  he  wanted  a little  comfort  hug  and  you  were  too  scared  of  the  AIDS  I  was  afraid  from  the  AIDS  tears  I  need  the  gypsy  tears  there  was  a time  no one  wanted  to play  with  Magic  Johnson  because  they  were  scared  of  the  AIDS  like  that  it  was  it  was  a little  freaky  a little  creepy  sounds 
[01:48:30]  the  dead  person  dream  is  usually  it's  just  my  dad  yeah  dead  person  dream  I  remember  hearing  that  whole  thing  when  AIDS  first  came  out  and  the  public  eye  there  and  the  public  brown  eye  Charlie  Dean  sound  effect  when  AIDS  people  get  it  I  was  like  uh oh  like 
[01:49:00]  the  thing  that  happened  I  was  actually  worried  about  the  tree  house  incident  thinking  that  somehow  I  could  have  gotten  AIDS  from  that  just  because  he  was  gay  and  it  was  some  kind  of  weird  like  sexual  thing  I  had  I  had  a  friend  who  was  so  paranoid  when  the  AIDS  thing  like  hit  for the  first  time  he  was  convinced  he  had  it  because  of  what 
[01:49:30]  like  you  didn't  know  if  he  drips  sweat 
[01:50:00]  on  you  if  you  shake  his  hand  you  tongue  kiss  him  you  didn't  know  you  thought  like  even  straight  sex  they  try  to  really  tell  you  straight  sex  and  especially  back  then  it  was  like  what  but  everyone  was  out  of  their  minds  like  what  the  fuck  does  this  mean  remember  when  it  went  around  maybe  for  a  week  that  mosquitoes  could  fucking  give  it  by the  way  I  don't  know  why  that  doesn't  happen  I  don't  tell you  the  truth  I  don't  know 
[01:50:30]  why  a  mosquito  bit  somebody  with  AIDS  and  starts  sucking  some  blood  out  and  then  lands  on  you  and  then  sticks  into  your  fucking  vein  why  don't  you  get  the  AIDS  I  don't  even  want  to  know  you  don't  even  want  to  know  because  there's  a  possibility  that  they  go  well  you  know  something  it  can  happen  know  why  because  a few  years  go by  and  they  go  oh  remember  that  mosquito  thing  we  were  wrong  yeah  you  can  get  it  now  that's  worded  it  says  should  I  worry  about  getting  AIDS  from  a  mosquito  bite  and  the  simple  answer 
[01:51:00]  is  no  should  I  worry  no  don't  worry  that  doesn't  mean  it  can't  happen  just  don't  worry  about  it  a  motherfucker  post  was  saying  that  they're  it  would  have  to  be  the  perfect  storm  of  AIDS  for  you  for  it  to  happen  the  mosquito  would  have  to  fly  through  arcing  jizz  coming  out  of  a  gay  gentleman's  penis  and then  land  on  you  what  if  the  mosquito  pops  him  in  the  pee 
[01:51:30]  hole  ow  I  don't  think  where  he  got  I  think  that  just  hurts  a lot  yeah  or in  his  anus  have we done  that bit  yet  his  anus  have  we  like  those  old  off  commercials  where  the  guy  sticks  his  arm  in  that  plexiglass  thing  with  all  the  mosquitoes  you  gotta  stick  your  dick  in  there  just  have  mosquitoes  land  on  and  fuck  up  your  dick  old  school  we  would  do it  I  know  we  would  have  that  done 
[01:52:00]  yeah  how  funny  would  that  fucking  be  damn  hysterical  we're  going to  break  we'll  do  the  breast  thing  next  and  Bobby  night  saying  chicken  shit  also  at  9  o'clock  we got  Johnny  Knoxville  promoting  the  Jackass  movie  Jackass  3D  no  unfortunately  not  see  I  thought  he  was  coming  in  and  I  don't  think  we've  ever  talked  to  Johnny  Knoxville  believe  or not  we've  talked  to  a lot  of  the  guys  from  Jackass  but  I  don't  think  we  ever  talked  to  Johnny  himself  I'm  trying  to  remember  I 
[01:52:30]  get  a  picture  with  the  phone  I  know  we  might  have  done  a  phone  with  him  over  the  years  I  think  we  did  once  yeah  yeah  kind  of  remember  maybe  for  one  of  the  other  Jackass  movies  then  we'll  talk  about  the  whites  of  West  Virginia  that  fine  documentary  on  Showtime  was that  it  with  the  dream  yeah  that's  about  it  I  don't  remember  anything  else  it's  just  I  wouldn't  lean  over  and  hug  him  because  of  the  AIDS  tears  yeah  instead  of  gypsy  tears  gypsy  tears  for  the  AIDS  to  cure  the  AIDS  gather 
[01:53:00]  around  the  campfire  kids  and  toast  yourself  a  marshmallow  settle  in  for  another  tall  tale  from  your  old  uncle  Al  Al  Jorgensen  what's  the  ostrich  story  about  we  dropped  a couple  tabs  of  acid  we  went  to  a  zoo  I'm  not  going  to  name  the  city  in  Europe  because  in  case  this  ostrich  is  pregnant  or  something  I  don't  want  him  to  get  back  to 
[01:53:30]  us  but  I'm  with  my  keyboard  tech  and  we  decide  we're  so  wasted  on  this  sin  we  decide  we're  going to  hide  in  the  bathroom  and  wait  until  security  closes  the  place  down  so  it's  night  time  we're  walking  around  this  empty  zoo  trying  to  dodge  security  people  that  rocks  right  off  the  back  we  walk  tripping  balls  we  walk  past  this  fence  and  there's  a  goddamn  ostrich  with  its  head  in  the  sand  or  dirt  or  whatever  just  totally 
[01:54:00]  ass  in  the  air  and  my  keyboard  tech  goes  apey  jumps  the  fence  I don't  even  know  what  the  hell  he's  doing  he  goes  there  unzips  drops  trout  and  tries  to  put  his  dick  in  an  ostrich  that's  sleeping  what  is  he  thinking  is  the  ostrich  not  an  ostrich  with  its  ass  in  the  air  second  of  all  what  is  the  ostrich  pussy  versus  the  ostrich  ass  he  may  be  gay  I  have  no  idea  man  you  don't  know  where  he's  shoving

[02:00:00]  a lot of gunplay  the  the guns  just sound  amazing  good sound  real good sound  which is important  right  very important  in a movie  with guns  you watch old movies  and they suck  because the sound  was like  pew  yeah  and the kill shots  were pretty amazing  and a little different  and John Goodman  was really good  in this movie  he bones fly  oh nice  and the preacher  was incredibly good  in this movie  he creeped me  the fuck out  how good he was  yeah 
[02:00:30]  and it makes you think  wow there are  actually people  walking around  that are just  like that guy  mostly based on  like a Westboro  church situation  even the girl  Carrie who was here  she played a really  good creepy  over religious girl  yeah  I liked it  I don't know  what the reviews  are saying  but I certainly  liked it  and it's going  to do well  for Mr. Smith  comes out in October  October 19th  what else do you want  to say about the movie  I guess that's about it  no it was really good  just the questions  the fans asked  sucked  yeah what happened  with that 
[02:01:00]  because you asked  me about it yesterday  yeah yeah  I had a bell man  I've been to  Kevin Smith's  Carnegie Hall show  was the last time  I saw Kevin Smith live  where he goes out  and he's just amazing  he's entertaining  as all hell  knows how to tell  a story  really funny  and he feeds off  his fans  and the questions  they ask for the most  part  he's got a few  things he wants  to talk about  obviously  and he decided  to go with that  same vibe  after the movie  and the cast  came out  and it was really  cool to see 
[02:01:30]  most of the players  from the movie  including Melissa Leo  who just won that Oscar  in The Fighter  she's in Kevin Smith's  new movie  and then the fans  he did a little  Q&A with the fans  and after about  a half hour  had a bell  it just was nonsense  what were they doing?  four of them  were pitching a movie  to him  what?  yeah people were  booing  because they kept  pitching a movie  one pitched a movie  to John Goodman  they kept  pitching a movie  after movie  what the fuck  are people dumb? 
[02:02:00]  what are you doing?  and I respect Kevin  because he wants  to have no filter  he just wants  to go with  whatever they want  to do  but I think  he had a slightly  different audience  than the people  that would actually  go to see  a Kevin Smith  presents  you know what I mean?  because it was a movie  as well  so someone would  actually get up  and say  hey John Goodman  I want to ask you  something  I got a movie  and did people  immediately go  boo shut up  fuck you  yeah  and that dope 
[02:02:30]  Robin Bird  remember Robin Bird  the public access  public access  one of her people  ruined the whole  fucking thing  because it was a guy  right  he pitched a movie  going  when are you going  to do the  Robin Bird story  he gave you  a script years ago  ugh  it's like  obviously he doesn't  give a shit  about Robin Bird  and doing the  Robin Bird story  let it go  go somewhere else  with that shit  people don't know  how to act in public  and then the guy  just kept going on  and on 
[02:03:00]  and on about it  I don't even know  how to react to that  that is infuriating  yeah it was frustrating  I had to go  and what did Kevin say  was he like  shut up  sit down  no he's  Kevin is  is way cool  yeah no I know that  but when someone's  pitching a movie  it's like  it's completely  not what should be  going on  we could all learn  from Kevin  nothing phases the guy  you know  I'd be out of my mind  I'd be like  you're ruining  the whole fucking thing  we're trying to do here 
[02:03:30]  shut up  shut the fuck down  right  nah he doesn't do that  but that's his thing  you know  and I respect that  I was frustrated though  so I walked across the street  and did a little Sam and Dave  but  cause they were live  on Saturday  but the movie itself  was good  I liked it  I really did like it  and I'm not a horror movie guy  and I'm not a shoot em up  movie guy  it was a combo  of the both  and I liked it  definitely liked it  well I definitely  want to see it  I just couldn't  you know  and you realize 
[02:04:00]  how good of an actor  John Goodman is  holy shit  yeah  cause I mean  he was in the Big Lebowski  he was amazing in that  and I don't  after that  he was on a little show  called Roseanne  I never heard of that show  I was never a Roseanne fan  yeah  but  what other movies  has he done  he did The Babe  he did Blues Brother 2000  that's my first one of the day  by the way  cause they keep track  of that now too  what  oh  but that's my first one  today  so relax 
[02:04:30]  arachnophobia  arachnophobia  oh he was in that  he was silly  in Monsters Inc  well that's true  he does a lot of animated  movies  I know that  big bucks in that  but I was trying to remember  other movies  John Goodman was in  The Adventures of Rocky  and Bowling  oh wow  disaster  wow he's been in  some real shit  yeah he's had  a lot of duds  he really is a good actor  I liked him a lot  so  he had a couple  good ones in there  right  babe  We're Back  A Dinosaur  oh that's right 
[02:05:00]  oh yeah  that movie's 17 years old  he was in King Ralph  oh my god  King Ralph  it's had some duds  scripts all the way through  he was Santa Claus  in Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer  some of the scenes  were filmed  wow  really really  and I guess it only cost  like 4 million dollars  is it dark  yeah yeah  it's a cloudy day  yeah  it's not a rainy day  but it's cloudy  some horror movies  like to go with  the rainy day  yeah  they go with  the cloudy day  7 it was raining  the entire fucking movie 
[02:05:30]  until the end  yeah  but uh  yeah good for Kevin man  it was a lot of fun  very cool  uh  breasts make you healthier  this is where we were at  before the break  yeah  fellows listen up  a new study says  it's actually healthy  to stare at a woman's breasts  500 men participated  in the German study  it's hard to pluralize breasts  a few of them were told  refrain from looking at  a woman's breast  for 5 years  the others were told  the study found out  that the men who stared  at breasts  more often  showed lower rates  of heart problems  a lower resting heart rate  and lower blood pressure  the authors of the study 
[02:06:00]  recommend that men  stare at breasts  for 10 minutes a day  erock get in here  a couple things  alright I've been nice  a couple things  I hate those medical  breakthrough or something  having a hard time  saying breasts  baby will calm me  the fuck down  and I believe that one now  yeah  does it  yeah when I'm having  one of those weird  irritable days  it's because you probably  can't be like crazy  we all know that  I can sometimes  you want to pull  your own hair out  but when he's screaming 
[02:06:30]  and yelling  you don't know  for what reason  shut up  right  but man  a baby will chill  you the fuck out  do you feel calm  when you're holding  your sister or brother's  kid  no  when they were younger  no  every time  I would hold  a baby  I am tense  and like  alright take the pictures  and get this fucking  thing out of my hands  yeah I was like that  until I had my own  I can't deal with  holding kids  they're petrifying to me  even my own nephews 
[02:07:00]  and nieces  my cut off  was six months  yeah  so my  my brother's wife  would pop out a kid  yeah  or my sister  fair enough  I would  just like you  take the fucking picture  here's the newborn  take the picture  and then I wouldn't touch them  until they're six months old  that's it  there'd be a major gap  I think  I think I know what picture  Travis is looking for  it's a picture of me  holding  oh is there a bad one  little Riley  where it looks like  it looks like  I'm ready to drill my thumb 
[02:07:30]  right into the soft spot  I'm holding  are you so uncomfortable  his baby  and I'm just going like this  no I was doing it on purpose  oh okay  he's like  give me my baby  don't touch the soft spot  I don't know what that is  but wow  you guys take a lot of pictures  sure do  yeah  oh look at that  there's little Travis  and the little baby  and  that was the old days right  do you miss having a baby  baby  Travis  yeah  now that you have a 
[02:08:00]  like a real kid  a toddler  yeah  you start  I could see where  it could be addicting  you're going to have more  uh  oh that means yes  that means yes  right there  any uh  means unprotected sex  it could happen anytime  no I'll tell you what that means  yeah  and I didn't even talk to Travis  about it  alright  he had to tell  wants to have more kids  but is very responsible  ah  and you want a little  uh  little more money  coming in before you have  this place is throwing around  are you crazy  you could probably have 
[02:08:30]  fucking ten kids  did I read that  yeah I would love  I would love to have  another  you're one of those  responsible parents  but yeah I'm not gonna  I'm not  first I'm not gonna hurt  you know my kid  that I have right now  by taking stuff away  from her  by having another kid  wow look at that  responsible parenting  I think some other  uh group of people  could really  uh do with uh  thinking the same way  there was  well  I think everyone knows  one of my family members  absolutely wanted more kids  but didn't  because of that  very reason  yeah  and look  I wasn't making money yet 
[02:09:00]  so don't fucking blame me  Jesus  don't blame me  don't blame me  there it is  oh there  you're a lunatic  that's a hard old picture  yeah but that doesn't  prove the point  of you being uncomfortable  no it was uncomfortable  that's why I was  oh there's the uncomfortable  that's the nice  like here you go  there's the fake smile  like okay  take the picture  and then I'm like  alright take the baby  I'm like god  look how tiny  was that post  hair plugs  um  I think so  holy shit 
[02:09:30]  are you serious  yeah  that's like fucking  I might have to  start googling soon  hair plugs  I'm gonna fucking google  I don't even try to  I don't even try  you know  I didn't even  I'm just like  yeah I think it is  it's like  plugs  no  individual follicles  placed artistically  in the direction  your hair grows  my uh  my kid  has decided  that he needs  to pull my hair out  to calm the fuck down  oh really  that's what I'm telling people  because I've had a bad  few months  no but he  he is pulling at it  really fucking hard 
[02:10:00]  yeah  really hard  Jesus Christ  can I have  just big  clumps of hair  in his  little fingers  I don't know  hey uh  Joe in Boston  uh  you saw Red State  last night Joe  sure did  I sure did  you cocksucker  hey uh  they were great  Kevin Smith did  what was not  expected of him  he took it  in different directions  it was great  you liked it huh  yeah  and the thing is  like he really  got to  I think the 
[02:10:30]  bittersweet moment  after this thing  he was able to  deliver in Boston  as opposed to  New York  where you guys  had people  pitching ideas  he was able  to really get  emotional  the guy almost  cried  it was awesome  yeah  it was awesome  I think um  I think Kevin's  really digging this  movie  I think he really  believes in this  movie  I think at first  he believed in  Cop Out too  I to this day  because people  still kill me  about it  I liked Cop Out  and say what you  want  I did like that  movie  but then people 
[02:11:00]  go oh you  only said that  because you're  friends with  Kevin Smith  I liked the  movie  I think I was  caught up in  the premiere  and maybe the  premiere  I got all  caught up in it  when you saw  the celebrities  sitting all around  you  yeah yeah  and you're like  as you're walking  out you're just  looking at celebrities  and you're like  this is great  this is great  I would throw that  on the table  maybe it was that  I don't know  but I did enjoy  the flick  I enjoyed how  it was shot  I enjoyed it  I didn't like  Bruce Willis  at all in the movie  yeah  but I loved  Sean William Scott  I think he's  hilarious  I think he's  a really funny dude 
[02:11:30]  naturally  Tracy Morgan  I thought was  really good in the  movie  I enjoyed that  movie like I  enjoy 90%  of the movies  that I enjoy  I wouldn't put it  on  it's a movie  that I could put  on  don't have to  think too much  and it's just  kind of there  and it's fun  and whatever  I wouldn't put it  on my list  of top comedies  or best movie  ever  but I didn't  think it sucked  and honestly  a lot of people  said the other  guys is a really  good movie  I watched the  other guys  I didn't like it  I liked the  other guys  I didn't really  like it  I thought it  was pretty good  I thought Will 
[02:12:00]  Farrell once again  was really funny  in a movie that  was you know  okay  yeah  I don't know  Marky Mark was  kind of good in that  playing the straight man  it was pretty good  I guess  he was very kind of  boogie nights  I think what I  didn't like about  the other guys  was it was  like I didn't even  understand what  they were doing  they were going  with the Bernie  Madoff thing  basically  which is really  complicated  and then at the  end of the movie  like someone  pointed out  before I saw it  which made me  laugh really hard  because I knew it  going into it  they had to  explain the movie  during the credits 
[02:12:30]  because they realized  holy shit  no one knows  what just happened  no one really  understands this  financial world  right  there were some  funny comedy  scenes obviously  but you liked  Red State  oh it was  beautiful  beautifully shot  the sound  like you said  I noticed  every gunshot  in that movie  was allowed  and it was just  crazy  the twist that  happened  it's just like  I'm not going  to explain anything  obviously  yeah don't  but hopefully  I hear a really  good buzz about  this coming out  and you know  it's really sad  that Kevin Smith 
[02:13:00]  is going to hang  this all up  after the next movie  I'm kind of pissed  off about it  but he's going to  continue doing  great things  on his internet  radio show  that he's going to  be doing  well he's obsessed  with radio  which amazes me  we want to get  the fuck out  of this business  and he wants  to go in it  what's wrong  with you Kevin  we all want  to do what  you're doing  we look as much  as we can  into visual media  and he wants  to fucking  just get the  pictures out  of it  and go to radio  what the fuck  I don't know  the grass is  always greener  ah yes  alright guys 
[02:13:30]  I won't talk  over you  I got to punch  out  see you later  alright  right on  yeah I like  Red State  I think it's  going to  certainly have  an audience  cool  yeah it's kind  of a  Top Out was  a great movie  I wouldn't say  it was a great movie  because people  love twisting  every little word  we say in the show  I wouldn't say  it was a great movie  and in all fairness  the other guys  got a better review  on Rotten Tomatoes  yeah it did  so it did  alright  so there you go  but with that said  I did  I liked  Cop Out  I did  alright 
[02:14:00]  Bobby Knight  says chicken shit  on TV  did he get in trouble  did he have to  apologize  did he have to  apologize  oh boy  what the fuck  is with people  I don't know  I don't know  one second left  on the clock  that was really  really  no seriously  that was good  defense wins  the chicken shit  defense  what is it  a couple of moments  ago with the  five second situation  in the game  got a little taste 
[02:14:30]  of Coach Knight  and Digger  what they do  in a very difficult  situation for them  a little language  might have been  a little salty  we apologize for that  if it offended  any of our viewers  alright guys  time for our  Buick Saturday  that drives me  fucking nuts  that offends me  more than the curse  nuts  no one is offended  by that  and if they are  you don't need to  be dealing with  those people anyway  most of the viewers  that are watching  obviously college basketball  don't give a fuck  if you say chicken shit  they're catering  to the one or two 
[02:15:00]  complete lunatics  right  you have to be  literally  you have to be  insane  you have to be  a mental  patient  in this day and age  to be offended  by the word shit  and if you are  and you take it  so far as to  call  and call  advertise  and all that  you're a lunatic  and shouldn't even  be addressed  we're certainly  an out of touch  society  if media represents  us  because  don't apologize  who cares  they shouldn't be 
[02:15:30]  representing us  anymore  way over the top  majority  don't care  if you're cursing  on TV  if anyone was  offended  what  what do you  find offensive  on TV  I don't even  know what  I'm trying to think  I don't even know  what I would say  to that  Charlie Sheen's  broadcast was  offensive on the  computer  what I find  offensive is that  the Kardashians  are making  almost a billion  dollars each  that's what  offends me  that's offensive  because I don't  really understand  where the talent  is there  I don't know  what they do  they're just  really hot  and good looking 
[02:16:00]  yeah  but they pump  out reality show  after reality show  and they sit  around and do  nothing  I watched again  I'm like alright  what is this  Kardashian thing  about  so I watched  the Khloe  and whoever  the fuck  is in New York  I know Kim  and whoever  sister she  picked for this  reality show  are in New York  and they just  sit around  a lot deeper  than I could get  and they're  sitting around  just looking  at their phones  yeah  that's all  they do  that's the show  yes  I think  I don't fucking  get it  and I'm thinking  to myself  alright 
[02:16:30]  why are people  watching this  the numbers  are through the roof  for this show  because they're hot  that's it  yeah but there's  a lot of hot  girls on TV  why them  I don't get it  and once again  you can say  jealous  whatever  but I also  want to try  to understand  why people  are tuning  into that  I can't  give you an answer  I don't know  I don't know  what makes  people tune  into anything  I was watching  a fucking show  I'm fascinated  with fat people  shows 
[02:17:00]  and not like  the biggest loser  or game show  type  reality show  just give me  a show  where there's  a fat piece  of shit  in a bed  and can't move  and is making  excuses for everything  I was watching  one just last night  this big fat guy  I don't know  this is beyond  this guy's head  was so distorted  from fat  and his fat wife  is saying that  she wants him  to go upstairs  in a house  they've been in  for four years  he's never been upstairs  never been upstairs  because he can't  walk up the stairs 
[02:17:30]  and they go out  to the store  and she's pushing  his fat job  of the hot ass  in a wheelchair  and you're like  and the guy's  bitching  like you know  oh god  I want to have  people over  but I don't want  to eat around  my bed  downstairs  is a hospital bed  that he lays in  with those spread  apart fatty legs  nice  and the wife  just enabling  wife brings him  the food  and don't feel  sorry for the wife  in those situations  oh no I don't  she's a fat slob  too  they love it 
[02:18:00]  yeah  it gives them  a purpose  they love it  purpose power  I would love to think  that it's a burden  on the family  but it's not  especially with the wives  then they brought  the sister over  and she was a fat slob  it was like a big  fucking house  of fat  and uh  I love those shows too  and I'm fascinated  with fat people  because it's the  sideshow mentality  it is  absolutely  a fat man  and I  I respect that  these uh  networks and TV  shows figure out  how to get the  sideshows back on TV  as long as you have 
[02:18:30]  some weird  sort of message  yeah yeah  running through the show  or maybe a disclaimer  at the end  then you can do  the sideshow stuff  do whatever you want  it's a sideshow  but if you just go  look at this fat  fucking slob  and how it lives  you know  there'd be outrage  ladies and gentlemen  this woman lives  with 25 cats  yeah  you know  and that's pretty much  what it is  when you watch  hoarders and stuff  like that  but like you said  they do it under  the guise that  they're helping  and they brought  the freak show  to television  what's the difference  no difference 
[02:19:00]  they're gonna look  at this fat slob  you're peering in  you're taking a peek  like you're looking  through the curtain  at the circus  at the fucking  bearded lady  or the fat man  or whatever  those hoarding shows  don't want a psychologist  but they know  they need a psychologist  or they would get  kicked off TV  right  the basic gist of that  is let's show you  somebody that is  living in filth  and you could go like  ew that's disgusting  and laugh  and everything  and just when it gets  where it's getting outrageous  they bring in the psychologist  no see  we're helping  and then she does 
[02:19:30]  a little thing  and then she moves  back out  so we can see  more disgusting shit  oh  and another show  that I took a peek at  Secret Millionaire  oh I heard about this one  Secret Millionaire  what a bunch of shit  that is  there was some  fucking woman  with big boobs  big fake tits  she makes her money  selling these fucking  you know  look good  fucking videos  and shit  and products  and she makes millions  she used to be homeless  she's like  oh seven years ago 
[02:20:00]  I was living in my car  and stuff  alright whatever  I swear to you  every  three to five minutes  on this show  someone's crying  someone's crying  it was like me  in my early teens  why are they crying  I don't know  she'd like  she went to these  two black women  that are running  this soup kitchen  and they're like  we've been here  80 years  and we're feeding  all the peoples  and she's looking  at them  and her eyes  get all watery  and her lips  start squipping  and she goes  you people 
[02:20:30]  are fantastic  and she's crying  and then she's talking  to some other woman  and she's like  they gave me a chance  I used to come here  for food  and now I'm helping out  because I've been  giving the chance  and it was nothing  but the whole show  was crying  and this big titted monster  looking pissy eyed  the whole show  she's either crying  or looking like  she's just ready to cry  why are they crying  did you give them  money at the end  I was yelling that  I was actually sitting  on my couch  out loud yelling 
[02:21:00]  why are they crying  you don't even know  in the end  no  did you watch  to the end  yes  our voice is getting loud  why  it's a cry  look at this  why are they crying  everyone's crying  the black guy's crying  stop it  someone tell me  Mason his eyes  please tell me  why are they crying  now I need to know  yeah what's with the crying  what's with the crying  secret millionaire  I like that undercover boss  I'll admit  undercover boss  is pretty funny  I like it  that's like  and when they cry 
[02:21:30]  on that  wow  we're supposed to believe what  she's undercover what  she said  she's new in town  and she's looking for places  to volunteer  of course  everyone's going to invite her in  look at those tits  of course  and she went to  disadvantaged people  which you know  well that gets the tears going  every time  yeah  disadvantaged  oh it's over there  where am I  and then she went to this  she went to that soup kitchen  and she's watching people eat  and she goes to this 
[02:22:00]  toothless black guy  at the table  and she's like  she's smiling at him  and just shaking his head  like  it's so wonderful  that you have a place  to come to eat  and he's like  I love the food here  and you get to sit with France  and she's like  that's wonderful  and she starts crying  meanwhile I'm thinking  outside he would probably  clock her over the fucking head  with a cobblestone  take her pocketbook  and squeeze her big  fucking fake titties  so why are they crying?  that's what I would do  well why was the crying?  look  more tears  why? 
[02:22:30]  dude  now it's a montage  of crying  now the whole family's crying  cause you've done a great job  what job did he do?  and you're a good father  and you're a great provider  no you're not  you've worked so hard  on this show  I don't have  well  again thank you  we say thanks many times  but  well that's him  thank you so much  for doing my little sister's room  what's his dream?  why are they crying?  what's going on?  I guess she just gave him a check  for how much?  that's good  when I give fucking  checks to the underprivileged  I cry too 
[02:23:00]  it's called my taxes  thank you  thank you for coming  you know why this show sucks?  because the check should be  that kid have cancer?  probably  I think that's a cancer kid  it's a cancer hat  it's obvious  it's got cancer earrings  a cancer hat  yeah  I don't  yeah  yeah  well the earrings are just because of the nationality I think  oh okay yeah  they start young  they pierce him young  they pierce him young  in that circle  they should give the check 
[02:23:30]  when the cameras are off  because now the government's  going to want their piece of that  that's fine  secret millionaire check  gift tax biatch  that's right  that's why game shows are all bullshit  I don't know if people know that yet  yeah  tax  you have to pay the tax  on all that shit you win  on anything you win  so most of the time  they have to give half of it back  just to pay the taxes  yeah  and it is like half  oh here she is  with the two little black women  it's like Mother Abigail 
[02:24:00]  from The Stand  two of them  wow Ruth is a mess  well  I wanted you guys to know  how much you impacted my life  the reason why the love kitchen  means so much to me  the love kitchen  is because I was homeless  and  so when I found out about this place  and I heard that  you guys know what you're doing  it blessed me  because  no one reached out  a woman like that  she'd never be homeless  she didn't have those tits  when she was homeless  and I became a millionaire

[02:26:00]  yeah  hey going back to fat guys  and fat shows  we lost a fat guy  over the weekend  uh oh  a guy that used to brag  about how fat he was  29 years old  wait a minute  he had a chain of restaurants  do we have that story  Dom the Snake Prudhomme  was it him  no  it's Paul Prudhomme  Dom the Snake  was it  I guess the guy  was well known  he had an eatery  where he bragged  how unhealthy  his shit was  really  yeah  was he  would I know his name  no but he was like 
[02:26:30]  he was  Big A  no it wasn't  no  it was Big A's place  Arnold's  we have that  Andrew's  oh the heart attack grill  heart attack grill  even bragged  even bragged  how did he die  unfortunately not heart attack  oh 572 pounds  wow  but what was his  what was the cause  it was  possibly from contracting pneumonia  after a bout with the flu  AIDS  AIDS  pneumonia  AIDS  if you're that fat  well  what are you gonna do  you can't defend against it  best story ever though  chicken wing inventor 
[02:27:00]  heart attack  really  the guy that invented  the buffalo chicken wing  I think his mom technically  he was  he was a drunk bastard  that was the heir to the chicken wing  now I need the buffalo people  fortune  I think he was a drunk bastard  came home from drinking  to the family restaurant  and he was hungry  with his boys  and the mom's like  well all we got is  the shitty parts of the chicken  that we usually throw away  but I don't know  maybe I can whip up something here  so she whipped up some chicken wings  and then they went  holy shit  this is pretty fucking good 
[02:27:30]  and that's how the chicken wing  was discovered  damn  so I think  anyway that guy  who technically was  you know  in on the invention  coronary  early age  oh boy  yeah those things  aren't too good for you  572 pounds  spokesman of unhealthy  eatery dies  here you go  I guess he was very well known  after a bout with the flu  mm-hmm  well  damn  if he was in better shape  maybe he would have been able  to fight that off  I don't know  maybe  flu's a rough one though  the pneumonia's a rough one right 
[02:28:00]  well that's what  that's what Richard finally died from  well the pneumonia  could go either way  I wouldn't hug him  you don't want the AIDS tears  no  mm-hmm  yeah  you know what show I'm watching  is Idiot Abroad  that's funny yeah  that fucking show is hilarious  I think there is something wrong with him  he's got like  that Asperger's  I call it Asperger's  how come I'm hearing Asperger's a lot more these days than you used to  I'm starving  so we got any of those Asperger's  Asperger's  we're all out 
[02:28:30]  got some all out  nah he's obviously one of those  what are they called  one of those  um  Idiot Savants  uh  he's uh  like uh  Asperger  what is that  huh  retard  well  the A  the R word  yeah  I'm sorry  R word pledge  autistic  thank you  thank you  whoever uh  pal talker  no  I just blurted it out  yeah  they said simpleton  yeah  he's got some form of autism  autism  yeah  that's what makes that so funny  he is weird 
[02:29:00]  huh  he is weird  yeah  he got to uh  Machu  what is it called  Machu Picchu  Machu Picchu  Machu Picchu  he fucking hiked for eight hours  this is the episode I saw yesterday  I'm a little behind  I guess it might be  the second to last episode of the series  but it's the Ricky Gervais thing  yeah  with Steven Murcham  two very funny guys  and uh  Carl's very very funny  Carl  I don't know if he knows he's funny  that's what's  I don't  I'm trying to figure him out  yeah  I don't know what he thinks he's doing  cause he has unbelievable improv skills 
[02:29:30]  yeah  like he could just like  talk about shit  and make it hilarious  but  but he doesn't take in the moment  which  which makes you think  he's partly autistic  yeah  and uh  he  he hikes all day  to Machu Picchu  and I guess  how Machu Picchu  set up  you're like  above Machu Picchu  and then you gotta hike down  to the fucking  actual Machu Picchu  yeah  and he calls up Ricky Gervais  on his satellite phone  and goes  I'm not going down there  he hiked the whole fucking day  why wouldn't he finish it  and he had no desire  he goes  it looks good from here 
[02:30:00]  I don't wanna go down there  wouldn't you  go the distance  you would think  if you were there  but he didn't care  he didn't have a thought  in his mind  where he thought  it would be a good idea  to continue  he thought it was good enough  and that's what  Asperger's people do  I don't know  but I would assume  I mean Club Soda Kenny  would be that guy  Club Soda Kenny  would hike all day  and not go all the way  to Machu Picchu  because he could see it  and go  nah it's good enough  yeah  I don't get that  I don't get that at all 
[02:30:30]  and it really bothered me  watching this show  well it would  because Machu Picchu  is a place I wanna go  it's one of those dumb places  I've always wanted to go  check out  Asperger's  Asperger's  you google image  Asperger's  a lot of good stuff  comes up  a lot of burger jokes  there's an ass  with a burger in it  yeah I like that  with the booty  the booty  with the booty  with the meat patty  and the cheese  and the tomatoes  and the lettuce  in between  in between the cheeks  uh  Beretta  Parks and Recreation  I have not  checked out that show 
[02:31:00]  believe it or not  but I just got season one  from rolling  I'm gonna finally be in  on that show  I find it very hard  to watch a series  to watch  like to get into a series  now  the last one  I really got into  was Lost  like as far as  a dramatic thing  not reality  not kind of  those pickers  and all those  other pawn stars  I'll watch those  but to get into  like Top Shot  but to get into a series  like hey  it's people acting  with different names  than their own  but I think  they're finally making 
[02:31:30]  a comeback  are they?  yeah I think  they finally realized  that we're sick  of the same old shit  like Shameless  is a really good show  Community I hear  is a really good show  I just find it  very hard  to even  Park and Recreation  I hear is a good show  I have an attention span  long enough  to sit there  and watch a show  are you talking  like funny shows  or just  I'm talking anything  like I said  Lost was the last show  I got into  and had to watch  like every episode  to watch every episode  yeah I guess  you make a good point  and I don't have 
[02:32:00]  there's not a show  now that I'm like  oh I have to catch that  Seinfeld reruns  that's about it  it's a lot of good TV  out there again  I don't know  where it is  or what it is  because I find myself  flicking around  the channels  like a madman  Shameless is pretty good  I wish there was  like good shit on  yeah  are you gonna watch  the Mike Tyson  and people even said  that was on what  was that on last night  started last night  started last night  I thought it started  today  no it started  last night  oh I fucking  hope we DVR'd that  I'm sure Animal Planet 
[02:32:30]  doesn't replay everything  oh my god  500 times  good point  true  yeah it's one of  those channels  good point  especially a new show  that they really  want to promote  true  yeah I'll check it out  yeah it's Tyson  you know  gotta check it out  alright  can we break  before Johnny Knoxville  or is that bad  hope so  it's a timing issue  should we take a chance  they're conversing inside  they're discussing  they're discussing  he should be calling  in like a second  so  one  well you know  not literally  alright a second 
[02:33:00]  from now  one  now  let's listen to the  streaming  you wanna take a quick  break  like  yeah we'll do a quick  break  and when we get back  we should have  Johnny Knoxville  stay there  the virus  Sirius XM  this is the  O.P. and Anthony  Show  perfect timing  is Johnny Knoxville  on the hotline  on the phone 
[02:33:30]  he's on the phone  it's been a while  since I seen  Jackass 3D  you just saw it  a couple days ago  right  on the DVD  the DVD  so once again  they're hooking it up  right now  I see that the  Hollywood  wrestling volleyball  continues  oh he's not ready yet  what  who the what the  I don't know  who's got the money  who's the investor 
[02:34:00]  you gotta call some  people  jewels  and also  looking at my  fan mail  people are saying  oh Tim Marson  I thought you were  gonna go too  who's a friend of the  show now  is one of the  Biggest Loser guys  he's a Long Island guy  you didn't watch  Biggest Loser though  I just realized  no no  I think it was  season 2 winner  Eric  yeah  who ended up  gaining a lot  of the weight  back  and then  he lost  a bunch  of it  since  oh Jesus  not  not  not 
[02:34:30]  not  not  not  that's  funny  sorry I didn't  have your mic  on for that  that was really good  but  now this is called  filler  I've been  talking to him  on Twitter  a little bit  he tweeted  a picture  of a guy  that was  an Uber  fan  with  licensed  plates  oh really  and  wow stickers  all over the  place  and telling me  yeah your  psycho fans  are out  here man  just wanted  to pass  this along  to you  I saw a guy  with like an  O&A license plate  at a store  yeah  I pulled into the parking lot 
[02:35:00]  but he was there  and I got out of the car  and he's looking  and he's like  oh my god  look at my plates  like oh god  Jesus  this guy's  fucking crazy  nothing beats  the radio show  tattoo though  I must say  nothing really says  I don't plan  on living  very long  like a license plate  like a tattoo  of a radio show  is this him now  now they're picking  it up again  hey by the way  at 10 o'clock  we're trying 
[02:35:30]  something new  we're gonna  keep the channel  sort of live  every day  the guys are gonna  kinda host  like a post show  and play  like play audio  that hasn't been played  like maybe some audio  from your compound show  and other things  that are going around  in the hallways  and today  they're gonna feature  Brie Olsen  one of the goddesses  from Charlie Sheen's thing  yes of course  she of course  has been a friend  of our show  for a while  so we're gonna play  Earl getting jerked off  and Cream Pie Jones  getting jerked off 
[02:36:00]  by one of the goddesses  Brie Olsen  who's with Charlie Sheen  now  with that  let's go to the phone  and say hi  to Johnny Knoxville  Johnny  hey good morning  fella  there he is  how are you sir  good how are you  fellas  good  where are you  right now  I'm in Los Angeles  oh shit  it's early  that's right man  damn  you gotta get up  for this shit  I was up  doing light calisthenics  really  you don't seem  like an early  morning guy  well you know  what  I do get up 
[02:36:30]  around 6.37  I don't know  why  but I do  damn  that's  you still like  party hard  or anything  nah  like  I got a 14 month  old man  and  like I gotta get  my kid to school  this morning  I'll have some  beers at night  but I don't  like  you know  like really  if I'm out of town  you know  I'll drink with the fellas  but  I'm pretty chill  well 
[02:37:00]  Johnny  you just answered  your own question  you don't know  why you're up  at 6.30  you got a 14 month old  of course you're up  at 6.30 usually  yeah yeah  well he sleeps  from 9 to 9  oh that's not bad  I get up early  so I can like  just look for  really stupid things  on the internet  and also to have  a little life  before  you know  he's up  yeah yeah  it's good  get a couple hours  by yourself  has that  has that  having a kid  changed your way 
[02:37:30]  of looking at things  like taking chances  and just  throwing yourself  out there  no  it's funny  because like  right before  I had my first  daughter  my life insurance  who's 15 now  I was like  man I gotta do  something quick  and that's when  I started doing  writing articles  for magazines  where I would  put myself  in harm's way  and right before  Rock  or like  a month  after Rocko  was born  I was like  well we  started Jackass 3  so I figure 
[02:38:00]  I guess  each time I have a kid  I figure I have to  do something quick  yeah and  holy shit  you really  take some abuse  in Jackass 3  like  a lot of the guys  do  but I think  the brunt  of the real  dangerous shit  you throw yourself  right into it  is that on purpose  or just the luck  of the draw  well it's kind of  it's just kind of  how it's turned out  I much prefer  to do the stunts  the bigger ones  as opposed to 
[02:38:30]  watching my friends  do them  I mean the guys  put them  they get  they get a lot  of injuries  themselves  but if there's  bulls or something  involved  I'd just rather  take it  you would rather  take the bull  oh my gosh  yeah it's nerve  wracking to watch  your friend do  something  it's nerve wracking  to watch anyone  do that  yeah because  I just got  Jackass 3D  on DVD  and I love  the I really  love the old  school 3D  it's cool  I went down 
[02:39:00]  into the  I have a theater  in my house  I'm one of the  lucky chosen few  and I put those  glasses on  it works  it was like  really cool  yeah you get  four sets of  glasses with it  with the two  disc set  and the blu-ray set  and yeah the  old anticlip version  looks really great  yeah it's a fucking  blue glasses right  yeah it works  really cool  and I was able  to see you know  that obviously  the now famous  dildo canon  if that god damn 
[02:39:30]  thing doesn't just  look like it's  flying right at you  that's amazing  not until the last  second do you know  what it is  yeah because you  know you're not  really showing  this thing  and you're looking  just going  ah it's a dick  you know Johnny  one of the biggest  laughs I've ever  heard in a movie  theater because I  went and saw it  in the theater  and that when  that dildo's  coming at you  I don't think  I've ever heard  a movie theater  laugh as hard  as they did  at that thing  man that was  fucking hilarious  yeah it ain't  clever but  who cares  sometimes the  simplest stuff 
[02:40:00]  is the best  yeah the  no we  we wanted to  take 3D to  an all new low  and hopefully  we did  and man  yeah we're  really surprised  at how successful  it was  well what's  amazing about  jackass 3D  is the new  technology you  guys are doing  with that  camera speed  holy crap  oh yeah the  high speed  cameras are  amazing in that  some of the  funniest use of  it is the  the Rocky  right  doing the Rocky  with the water  splash and then  the fucking  boxing glove in  the face  yeah  man we had 
[02:40:30]  so much fun  with the  that was my  favorite camera  was the  the phantom  camera  I would just  get whole days  where they would  let me use it  oh man  it was  one day I  brought it up  to my house  and like  I was just  throwing like  tennis balls  at wee man's  nuts  on the phantom  camera  and  I actually  ran a  Hot Wheels  track  one of those  electronic ones  right up to 
[02:41:00]  Preston's nuts  and had a car  right into it  and then  Pontius  finished himself  off on the  phantom  camera  but listen  you know  it only shoots  for four seconds  okay  yeah  and  they're like  when you're  getting ready to  go  by this time  everyone had  left and went  inside  because no one  wanted to watch  actually he got  mad for people  watching because  they were cracking  jokes and he made  everyone leave  and they're like  when you're getting 
[02:41:30]  ready to go  give us a signal  he's like okay  and then  the camera crew  comes inside  kind of  dejected  about 30  minutes later  and I'm like  what happened  they're like  all he said  was  oops  so they didn't  get the footage  that would be  a hell of an  arcing shot  probably look  quite spectacular  there's some 
[02:42:00]  crazy stunts  in Jackass 3D  we all know that  but the one  that really got  me was the  Christmas tree  or the tree  where they climbed  to the top of it  and then you guys  chopped it down  how the fuck  do you decide  that's going to  be okay  well it's like  what was his  name  the bull rider  who's on  Dancing with the  Stars  I don't know 
[02:42:30]  oh damn  to be honest  oh man  he's married  to Jewel  yeah what's  his name  he's like  he's like  I look at  this cha-cha  like I look  bull riding  you're never  ready  it just becomes  your turn  same way  on Jackass  it just becomes  your turn  Ty Murray  Ty Murray  we got  yeah okay  that tree  stunt  ridiculous  yeah that  looked painful 
[02:43:00]  yeah it was  we were up  there for a  long time  and you know  the only way  the tree  could fall  and you have  a little bit  of a chance  is forward  if it falls  to the side  or back  we're in  big trouble  yeah  the snowpack  is almost  gone  and right  we're up  there for  about 15  minutes  and it  starts to  fall  and it  starts to  fall  backwards  and that's  when you  hear  we hear  a big  commotion  and they  run and  push the  tree forward 
[02:43:30]  the last  second  wow lucky  well we had  Yarpy  you know  saw on the  tree  he's never  he's got  he's got  one thumb  yeah he's  missing a thumb  yeah like  we gotta get  better people  no shit  that one  wow that  that fucking  dog left a  hell of a  mark on  your ass  too  oh yeah  man that  dog was  super  strong  Johnny jumps  up onto  this thing  this little 
[02:44:00]  cross member  and tries to  pull himself  up and the  dog jumps  up and it  looked like a  heavy dog too  and grabbed  onto his  ass cheek  and was  dangling in  the air  hanging by  Johnny Knoxville's  ass and  the dog's  teeth  yeah man  that was one  of those  things where  I saw a  picture on  the internet  of a guy  up a tree  with a  German shepherd  hanging from  his ass  and I was  like that  looks very  funny  well good  eye because  it was  it works 
[02:44:30]  hey we  know we  know you're  pushing  Jackass 3 on  3D it's  available on  Blu-ray and  DVD tomorrow  yeah but we  also want to  talk to you  about those  crazy whites  yeah man  holy shit  yeah we were  turned on to  this movie and  it's got to be  one of the best  documentaries I've  ever seen  yeah it's actually  called the wild and  wonderful whites  of West Virginia  yeah they're going  for it they're  winning  yeah the king of  white trash  how did how did 
[02:45:00]  that whole project  come about  I tell you I  saw the original  dancing outlaw  documentary about  it's been over  20 years ago  it was solely on  Jessica White and  it was cut  solely for  laughs  you know it  was like all  his quotes of  like I'll  slash your  throat if you  don't quit  making them  eggs as  runny as  you making  them  which is  funny but  we I was  taught I met  the one of the  guys who worked  on the original  he actually found 
[02:45:30]  Jessica and we  got to talking  and we decided  we wanted to  go see what  Jessica was up  to now over  20 years later  and so we  sent a crew up  there for three  days just to see  what we would  get and  and Jessica  is now like  probably the  fifth craziest  in the family  because all the  kids are growing  up you know  and they're  fucking bat  shit crazy  yeah I mean  they're like  yeah you saw  it like you 
[02:46:00]  know having  shootouts with  cops  stabbing each  other and  snorting  snorting  painters  painters  I need some  painters  I tried to  snort a pain  pill me and  my buddy tried  to snort a  pain pill in  high school  and man  if we  realized that  you you  not that I'm  condoning it  but you really  got to chop  those things up  because otherwise  you're just  snorting rocks  yeah it goes  up your nose  and you just 
[02:46:30]  start literally  crying  yeah  I you know  yeah don't do  that no more  but the  but man the  the whites  are  they're they're  living hard  and you followed  them around for  a year huh  yeah for a  whole year  and in we  tried to make  it a more of  a accurate  way of how  they're living  you know there  were funny  moments but  there were  really scary  moments bad  moments you  know the lady 
[02:47:00]  has the baby  and you know  10 minutes  later she's  snorting pain  pills in the  hospital  okay yeah  we're trying to  figure out what  she was snorting  that was a  pain pill  yeah okay  yeah and then  she and then  when they took  her baby away  the I think  it was the  mother of the  daughter that  just gave birth  like yeah  probably found  drugs in her  like so casual  like that's just  what happens in  that family I guess  yeah yeah  happened to the  daughter happened  to the mother  and then when  they pull up  the taco bell  and the 
[02:47:30]  the  uh  sue bob is  trying to tell  the people inside  taco bell they  took the baby  away  yeah  screaming through  the window and  they can't even  hear her  yeah  so twisted  man  have you talked  to them since  because I was  wondering that you  might have not  shown them in a  proper light and  they would go after  Johnny Knoxville and  said you fucked  with us  that's just  we turned on the 
[02:48:00]  cameras that's how  they live and I've  seen Jessica twice  since then I've  seen Mamie since  then yeah and  they're they're you  know they're fine  with the way it  turned out they  uh were at the  DVD release but  party out in Los  Angeles Jessica was  damn it must have  been like the  Beverly Hillbillies  man I tell you  there's a he uh  Dickerson in the  Echophonics played  he played Wipeout  and Jessica  tap danced to  Wipeout for the  car solo  it was amazing  it was one of the 
[02:48:30]  coolest things I  ever saw  that's twisted  yeah  he got his own  little wooden stage  up there and then  Dick came time for  the solo and Jessica  just killed it  that's like some  Hatfields and  McCoy shit  yeah  you know  that's  backwoods  yeah just  backwoods stuff  that like no one  could really get a  grip of  no one  yeah no one  you know  a lot of people  have never seen  anything like that  and uh  Jessica's lived  that  you could do a  documentary on  them every year  insane footage 
[02:49:00]  every year  I'm surprised  someone's not  pitching them a  reality show  well  yeah  my  my  my  my  friend  uh  I  went to  high school  with him  he's one of the  producers on it  he's wanting to do  a show with them  uh  but  they're really  they're  super  charismatic  and uh  you know  uh  you know  you meet them  they're  they're sweet  they just  they're just  you know  they just  that's what they know  a little fucked up  they know 
[02:49:30]  and that's what  they do  and uh  yeah man  that's something  man  yeah it's a  great one  when I see  Jessica  I get a little  starstruck  oh really  he's a celebrity  now  but then I'm  with Jessica  I'm like  god this is  Jessica White  hillbilly gold  man  and uh  again  Jackass 3  3D  on Blu-ray  and DVD  available tomorrow  uh  another thing I  wanted to ask you  about uh  Jackass  uh  you guys

[02:50:30]  people  you don't  realize that  people really  get angry  when you're  pissing on  them  like people  really get  that makes  people mad  that's their  line in that  world  or when you  if you're in  a bar  with your  buddy  and he  gets up  to go  to the  bathroom  just top  it off  with a  little  pee  and he's  not going  to be  very happy  no I  wouldn't  gather  if you go  to a bar  with the  guys  you can't  like leave  your beer  or drink  around  ever  because  it's  going to  be  like if  you leave  your beer  it's going  to be filled  up with  pee  you know  nice

[02:52:00]  they could  easily be  a minute  or two  longer  and we've  expanded  a whole  lot of  them  like  the  pin the  tail  on the  donkey  bid  and the  bubble  roller skate  and there's  also a lot  of  aside from  that  there's a  real funny  blooper  reel  which is  saying  jackass  is one  big  blooper  but  it  really  it's  really  good  man  pin the 
[02:52:30]  tail  on the  donkey  was  probably  one of  my  favorites  that  was  an  angry  donkey  they love  kicking  those  things  and  Aaron  I like  how he's  like  I won't  do that  anymore  if that's  okay  he completely  blew up  his argument  in two  seconds  it really  is funny  man  I would  definitely  recommend  you go  out and  get that  and the  3D is  cool  you know  you think  oh I see  it in the  theater  I can see  it in  3D  but when  you get  home  like I  said  this old  school  blue red  lens 
[02:53:00]  3D  it works  and it's  kind of  fucking  nostalgic  it's  pretty cool  man  yeah man  definitely  now we can  violate you  in your  very own  home  yes  absolutely  great man  hey Johnny  thanks for  calling in  man  hey thanks  a lot  and  can I  just tell  you my  cousin's  album  Too Fast  to Fly  by Roger  Allen Wade  is going  to be out  this week  the single's  available now  you just  did  yeah  we should 
[02:53:30]  play the  song  on a break  do we have  it in the  system  what's the  name of the  song  I think  we might  have it  over here  in our  computer system  yeah you said  the single's  out already  yeah yeah  on iTunes  Too Fat  to Fly  Too Fat  to Fly  we'll find it  if we have  it  it's not  about Kevin  Smith  but it was  inspired by  that incident  oh nice  Kevin's a friend  of ours  yeah yeah  it's not about  him but I just  read that thing  in the paper  I'm like Too  Fat to Fly  is funny  so I called  Raj and asked  him to write 
[02:54:00]  a song and he  came back with  it like in an  hour  oh nice  yeah  alright we'll  play that either  today or down  the road  alright thanks  guys  thank you  Johnny  I see you  Johnny Knoxville  everyone  Johnny  sounds a little  fucking  I gotta say  Johnny sounds  a little  fucking  either crispy  around the  edges  or like  you know  his morning  coffee  consists of  an Irish  coffee  it's early  out there  you think  it's a  leftover  from last  night  because he  said he  doesn't  party  I'll give 
[02:54:30]  him a pass  yeah  I'll definitely  give him a pass  I don't know  what's going  on there  you know  I'm in a  fucking  giant glass  fucking  house  I'm in a  glass bar  I can't  say anything  we're gonna  break  and well  actually before  the break  I want to  sell it again  starting at  10 o'clock  we're gonna  try  starting today  I think we're  gonna try  something new  finally with  the channel  and kind  of keep it  live  to 11  the guys  are gonna  like you  know  host that  hour  and hopefully  give you 
[02:55:00]  extra material  you know  stuff that's  going on  in the  hallways  and if we  reference bits  and stuff  then you know  we're gonna  play some of  those bits  in the 10  o'clock hour  with some  live intros  and stuff  so it all  makes sense  sounds good  and today  they're gonna  feature Brie Olson  who goes by  what name  with Charlie  Sheen  Rachel  Rachel  which is  her real name  Rach Rach  Rach Rach  yeah Rachel  Rachel  one of the  other Rachel  hello  who's done  our show  a bunch  and I'm  considered  a friend  of the show  I mean 
[02:55:30]  she jerked  two of the  guys off  and had a  major crush  on Jim  Norton  that's  amazing  so we're  gonna play  some of  that audio  at 10  o'clock  today  just to give  you a taste  of what  she's all  about  yarr  alright  alright  the Opie  and Anthony  show  hi  this is  Louis  Guzman  hey  this is  Michael  Chiklis  hey  this is  Michael  Moore  hey  this is  Morgan  Spurlock  hey  this is  Mike  Myers  and you're  wow  one second  I'm sorry  I thought  for a second  I was inside  Opie  and I thought  boy  that's  that's  faintly  medical  um  hi 
[02:56:00]  this is  Mike  Myers  and you're  listening  to  Opie  and  Anthony  oh boy  we have a  situation  that  hopefully  is being  worked on  if not  whatever  whatever  loser  that's  my new  motto  whatever  whatever 
[02:56:30]  can't fight  anymore  whatever  we want to  play some  Brie Olsen  audio  at 10 o'clock  you know  because she's  one of the  big players  in the  Charlie Sheen  saga  so that  would be  that would  be something  a lot of  people would  be interested  in hearing  this is not  a lot of  audio out  there of  her  she's done  a few  shows  but we're  a high  profile show  and she's  she's done  some great  stuff for  our show  but uh  because of  some policy  they have  in place  now  we can't  play 
[02:57:00]  audio  that might  happen  that is  breaking  the new  policy  shit that  happened  which doesn't  make sense  to me  but so  hopefully  this  Travis is  working on  it down  the hall  but you  might not  hear the  Brie Olsen  audio at  10 o'clock  which means  at 10 o'clock  you should go  check out  what else  Sirius XM  has  because there's  nothing to  hear  it goes  into outer  space  to hear  here  and then  comes back  I know  it's  and then  people pay  for it 
[02:57:30]  they know  what they're  doing  logically  then they  should  make sure  we don't  curse  yeah  because that's  that's way  worse  yeah  in the end  exactly  it's 99%  uncensored  what  it's 99%  uncensored  it's a very  important 1%  that includes  go  uh guys  uh guys  David in  Washington  uh David 
[02:58:00]  yes David  yo  hey what's  up guys  hey I'm a  fan of the  show so don't  take this  the wrong  way  but um  I was  listening to  the replay  and you guys  had that  kind of game  show about  the most  common person  and the  whole panel  you and  boss  talking about  well obviously  Islam is the  most dominant  religion in the  world  you guys  and that's  not the first  time you  said that  and it  sounds  ignorant  as hell  listen  all right  Christianity  is like  10 times  bigger than 
[02:58:30]  Islam  you can  google it  or you can  take the word  for it  but listen  Islam we're  talking pretty  much the  Middle East  and North  Africa  Christianity  we're talking  most of  North America  most of  South and  Central America  most of  Europe  how about  Asia  how about  Asia  right but  when you  combine all  of the  all of  Christianity  it's a  bigger  religion  than even  the  Hinduism  and the  Buddhism  of Asia  but as  far as  Islam  I don't 
[02:59:00]  think  they're  even  second  well what  are the  top  religions  in the  world  coming in  at number  one  I heard  Muslim  is a  big  one  that's  what I  heard  Muslim  is a  biggie  and I  would  have sworn  that they're  bigger than  Christianity  Christianity  is coming  in at  number  one  with  33%  coming in  at number  two  is Islam  at 21%  and rounding  out number  three  it's  non-religious  oh non-religious  non-religious 
[02:59:30]  is 16%  it's relatively  close there  sir  33%  to 21%  that's  within range  right  those are the  two biggies  you know what's  fucked up though  Christianity  includes  Catholic  Protestant  Eastern  Orthodox  Pentecostal  so it's all  the offshoots  all the  fucking  Latter Day  Saints  Evangelical  Quakers  and Islam  is just  suicide bombers  Shiite  which are the  extremes  right  and the  Sunnis 
[03:00:00]  yeah  I went to  a Sunni  yeah  yeah  State  University  of New  York  right  yeah  oh  okay  you're a  Sunni  oh I wasn't  sure I did  some Islam  and I didn't  even know  oh no  no  I thought  you were  Kuni  but it  says  Sunni  look  that's  count  no  no  no  no  Nobel  Nobel Prize  wait what  sounds like  Charlie Sheen  now just  babbling  no surprise  Kuni  a little  lower than  Sunni  fully  expected  are Kuni 
[03:00:30]  schools good  I don't know  which one is  Kuni by the  way  it's like  city  what does that  mean city  yeah  university  university  of New  York  yeah  all right  so non-religious  is 16%  oh the  guy hung up  because of  my Islamic  comment  I think  well  honestly  and why  was he so  upset that  we say  you know  what  it's number  one  who cares  we sound  ignorant  but  Catholic  is included  in Christianity  yeah  if you busted 
[03:01:00]  up all those  if you busted  up just the  Catholics  there's more  Islam people  yeah  yeah  Christianity  covers a  wide range  of  yeah  Jesus  you know  the whole  Jesus thing  let me tell you  something  I'm sort of  Catholic  and us  Catholics  we don't  we don't  acknowledge  the dirty  Protestants  no  of course  not  so we're  not in  the same  club  they were  always the  weirdos  in high  school  yeah  it's like  why not  just be  a Catholic  yeah  right  yeah 
[03:01:30]  an Eastern  Orthodox  and what  is a  penny  penny  penny  pincher  penny  that's  I don't  think they're  on that  thing  where are  they  what is  a penny  costal  oh  isn't that  fake  the ones  that are  only .22%  what is  a penny  costal  pentecostal  yeah  what is  that  I don't  know  is that  one  where you  could  like  become  a preacher  in the  mail  or  something  Jews  are  real  small  that's  where you  talk  in tongues  and hold  snakes  and shit  is it  really  I don't  want to  be  fucking  lumped in  with them  either  snake  handlers  that's  crazy  what is  a  latter  day 
[03:02:00]  saint  that's  you  know  half  this  shit  that's  your  Mormons  the  brangelina  is a  religion  that's  buddhism  no  over there  the  brangelina  that's  evangelical  that looks  like a B  but it's  an E  oh that's  an E  hence why  I went  and got  my glasses  primal  indigenous  oh that's  Indians 
[03:02:30]  where are we  at  African  traditional  6%  alright let's  do the whole  pie chart  so then you  got Christianity  which has  a whole  bunch of  the Quakers  in there  I don't  want to  be associated  with the  fucking  Quakers  so you  got  Christianity  at  33  you  got  Islam  at  21  then you  got  the  non-religious  people  at  16  then you  got  the  Hinduism  at  14%  and then  what did  you say  primal  indigenous  that's  your  American  Indians  your  African  tribes  things like  that  that's  6%  also  6%  is  Chinese 
[03:03:00]  traditional  which I  don't know  what that  is  but it's  also  6%  is  Buddhism  Buddhism  Buddha  and what  is that  tiny one  Judaism  is only  .22%  of the  world  are  Jews  why are  they so  powerful  it's amazing  they're like  superheroes  why don't we just  bum rush them  the Jews are like  superheroes  so small in numbers  get so mighty  in world power 
[03:03:30]  if you didn't see  that pie chart  what percentage  would you say  the world  is Jewish  Jewish  I absolutely  would have  said at  least  10%  10%  I would have  said 10%  I think  what county  are we in  yeah that  depends  where is the  test  where is the  hole being  taken  what was the  other one  we missed  there was  another tiny  little  Sikhism  Sikhs  those are  your  turban  wearers  why don't  you throw  them in  with this  long  they look  just like  them  they've  taken  quite  a beating 
[03:04:00]  for looking  like  them  too  hence  they start  beating  them up  poor  Sikhs  after 9-11  Jesus Christ  did they  catch some  shit  little bit  they had  nothing to  do with  anything  look we're  sorry  we didn't  know  we had  to be  educated  we lashed  out  we got  to apologize  we lashed  out  a few  people had  to take  one for  the team  until we  all were  educated 
[03:04:30]  I'm sorry  it happens  sometimes  an innocent  bystander  is going  to catch  an elbow  before 9-11  we didn't  know  anything  I'm sorry  we didn't  know  I apologize  we got a  quick education  on turbans  and those  towels  that  Yasser Arafat  would wear  on his head  and then the  one that Gaddafi  wears on his  head  they're all  different and  shit  but to us  it was just  under the  guise of  rag head  and you'd  be very 
[03:05:00]  angry at  anybody  that wore  a towel  as a hat  we know  now though  now we  know  with that  we gotta  say hi  to a big  star  we got  a big  star  on the  line  Matthew  how are  you sir  good morning  guys  Matthew  McConaughey  is on our  phone  and it's  Opie and  Anthony  I'm gonna  bring up  something  that I  guarantee  you don't  remember  sir  we actually  sat on  the same  couch  together  at the  Jay Leno  show  oh we were  drinking  those margaritas  huh  did he just  say we  did  yeah 
[03:05:30]  see  I brought  this up  knowing full  well you  would not  remember this  he's a busy  guy he does  a lot of  talk shows  margaritas  that made  me forget  yeah the  margaritas  with the  gas powered  blender that  Jay had  we were on  Jay  it was his  last show  before his  big Christmas  vacation so  he decided to  make margaritas  and he pretty  much called  it in that  day and  between you  and ourselves  we ran  that show  so  it was  very nice 
[03:06:00]  to drink  margaritas  with you  nice to  have somebody  that actually  wants to sit  down and have  a drink  every so  often  everyone's  teetotalers  these days  and you  were amused  at our little  story that we  got fired for  a little radio  stunt where  a couple had  sex in a church  you thought  that was  hilarious  oh he did  oh yeah  now you're  bringing him  I remember  this now  there we go  we fill in  the puzzle  as we go  along here  what is  Matthew  McConaughey  doing these  days  well it's a  new movie  the Lincoln  Lawyers  in theaters  next Friday  March 18th 
[03:06:30]  and I hear  it's the  first time  you're going  back to the  lawyer thing  since the  big movie  huh  well first  time back  in the  courtroom  since the  time to  kill  that was a  good one  feels good  man  it's a  great story  this is more  of a thriller  than I guess  time to  kill was  that's good  great cast  Ryan  Phillippe  William Ace  Macy  oh like him  John Leguizamo  Michael Pena  really heavyweight  cast  so who done it  too  now on  the movie 
[03:07:00]  poster  who are you  standing back  to back with  with your arms  folded  different movie  man  oh  we  yes  tell us  about it  we  we've been  pulling them  up and  looking at  it's like  how many  times is he  going to  pose like  that  hey  it's not  just me  a lot  of other  films  stole that  pose  and used  it for  their films  absolutely  not everywhere  now  we were  talking  I get  residuals  we were 
[03:07:30]  talking about  that  and the fact  that like  that seems  to be  the quintessential  chick flick  movie poster  is like  the guy  going like  looking over  his shoulder  with his  arms folded  going  and the girl  has got her  arms folded  and she's  going  I'll take  care of  you  you're not  getting away  with anything  and he's  like  I'm my  own man  but you  know by  the end  of the  movie  she's  going to  win  and that's  it  do you  want to  go pay  you 10  bucks for  that  20 million  opening weekend 
[03:08:00]  exactly  who are we  to make  fun of  that  he's banking  the guys  go to these  movies with  their girlfriends  and these  movies always  do very  well  but this  isn't a  chick flick  Matthew  this is some  heavyweight  real consequences  stuff  what's with  the name  Lincoln  lawyer  that's not  Abraham Lincoln  the fact that  I work  out of the  back seat  of my  1988 
[03:08:30]  Lincoln  Continental  why would  someone want  to hire  you  why would  they want  to hire  me  well I'm  good at  my job  but I'm  a bottom  feeder  this character  is a guy  who works  with the  bottom feeders  around downtown  Los Angeles  I thought  the term  lawyer just  covered the  whole bottom  feeder thing  but apparently  there are  different levels  well and  then in this  case what  happens in  this story  is this  character gets  a big money  case  Ryan Phillippe  and his  family he's 
[03:09:00]  up for a  rate charge  and they've  got all kinds  of money  so I'm  going to get  a big paycheck  it's going to  take care of  my life  don't tell me  don't tell me  I know  I know  you start  thinking about  the ethical  thing  and some  moral stuff  and a girl  gets involved  and when your  arms are folded  and you're  standing back  to back  you look over  your shoulder  and she looks  at you  and goes  don't you  take that  money  and you go  I'm going  to take  that money  and she goes  don't you  take that  money  see that  happens in 
[03:09:30]  the credits  that's a  prequel to  the second  one  this one  doesn't have  any of that  oh okay  it sounds like  a really good  movie  and how  great is  William H.  Macy to  act with  holy crap  it's fun man  there's a scene  in here where  you know  something Macy  does that's  really cool  adds on  to the  affirmative  you guys  will appreciate  what I'm  talking about  here  there's a scene  where I wake  up really  hung over  and he shows  up because  he was  some evidence  and I wake 
[03:10:00]  up and I  look like  shit  and I  answer the  door  he goes  jeez  you look  like shit  you need  to have  another  drink  and what  was in  the script  was jeez  you look  like shit  you need  to lay  off the  sauce  and he  flipped it  and said  no you  need to  have another  oh he  did that  himself  yeah he  looks like  he's done  that a few  times  yeah we  just spoke  with him  recently  and he  is a  fun guy  what  Macy  yeah  he came  in to  promote  shameless  which  that's a  great show  too  we're not  here to  promote  that 
[03:10:30]  certainly  but  of course  not  should be  said  it's a  great show  and he  openly admitted  that he  loves his  drink  yeah  one of my  ex-girlfriends  made me watch  Fool's Gold  and  they  then she  fell asleep  on me  and I  then  had to  sit there  not that it  was a bad  movie  but it's not  my type  of movie  you know  Matthew  sometimes  the chick  flicks  meh  not so  much  with me  well he's  not worried  about you  though  I know  exactly 
[03:11:00]  but she  like made  me  watch it  and then  she fell  asleep  she wanted  to get you  in the mood  man  these broads  why didn't  you turn  it off  that is  true  Matthew  McConaughey  let me know  that you  didn't turn  the movie  off  not me  you didn't  turn the  movie off  no no  I kept  watching  which means  it had to  be a good  movie  she was  laying on my  lap  I couldn't  get up  I was going  to wake her  up and then  she'd start  ragging me  exes  jesus  sounds like  you had a  good setup  and you  fumbled  I probably  did  she finally  woke up  later  I was like 
[03:11:30]  why'd you  fall asleep  and she  said hold  on get  in the  position  so I  folded my  arms  and I  leaned back  and she  leaned on  my back  and I was  like you  fell asleep  and she  goes I'm  going to  fall asleep  when I  want to  and I  said don't  you fall  asleep  but she  won in the  end  you know  and we  made up  are you  still making  fun of his  movie posters  no I'm  just commenting  on it  nothing to do  with that  I'm commenting  that's that  whole marketing  thing  is it  marketing  yes  when you  take those  pictures  are you  really  back to  back with  someone  are you  like green  screen  no you  go you  get your  back to 
[03:12:00]  back but  they put  in like a  door or a  curtain or  whatever  I'm  fascinated  with this  pose dude  I'm  fascinated  you do  that you  shoot those  things the  poster it is  mark you  shoot that  poster about  eight months  after you  finish the  film  oh okay  so the  hair's  different and  everything  I have a  feeling that  his inner  circle has  busted on  him  your friends  bust your  balls about  those  posters  no they  know  better 
[03:12:30]  I'm the  one  there you  go  I hear  you  yeah the  Lincoln  lawyer definitely  looks like a  really good  film yeah  looking forward  to this one  next Friday  yeah I like  seeing you in  those roles that  maybe take you  away from the  you know the  scarf around  your neck being  pulled around  you know  the what around  my neck  the scarf around  your neck being  led around like  a lap dog by  some girl you  know  that ain't me  not even in  those romantic  you didn't do  the scarf  you'd know that 
[03:13:00]  damn it  I probably  would have  you didn't  you do a  cover with  the  with the  the scarf  ghost of  girlfriends past  I think it  was  yeah yeah  she's leading  you around by  the scarf  but you're  smiling like  you ain't  taking me  anywhere and  she's going  I'm gonna  get you by  the end of  this and  then the  pictures of  your girlfriends  are looking  at you like  oh  and you know  my posters  better than I  know  I totally  do I'm  obsessed with  Matthew  McConaughey's  movie posters  well this  time I'm  back to  back with  the 1988 
[03:13:30]  Continental  all right  I'm trying to  make some  cash on the  street  Lincoln  lawyer  they got  nothing to  do with it  I'm trying  to get  what I  can  I like  it  I like  it  the  Lincoln  lawyer  yeah  the  Lincoln  lawyer  next  Friday  very  cool  Matthew  McConaughey  thank you  so much  in theaters  March 18th  that's right  all right  we'll let  you get  back to  whatever  you were  doing  I'm about  to go  shoot  another  poster  don't worry

[03:14:30]  think  the  publicist  is  going to  like  that  he's  an A  lister  uh oh  uh oh  oh no  oh no  Iraq was he  in with you  during that  oh yeah  was he  getting nervous  no he  seemed okay  he was like  well this  could have  gone worse  I love  hearing this  could have  gone worse  that was a  great  interview  this could  have gone  worse  he's actually  posing with  his car  like he  poses with  the girls  by the way  look  well he's  leaning  he's leaning  he's got  his hand  on his  hip  and he's  like  hey car 
[03:15:00]  you're  gonna take  me  he's like  I don't  put gas  in you  I work  out of the  backseat  I know  you  well I'm  not going  anywhere  I need  some air  in my  tire  I hope  in the end  he has  a sense  of humor  we sold  this movie  and had a  little fun  he has  to  I've seen  him  on things  tell us  he did  work with  what's-her-face  in contact  Jody Foster  ah yes  that's true  maybe there  was some  canoodling  on set 
[03:15:30]  something tells  me no  what do you  got rolling  oh nothing  is that okay  yeah it should  be fine  it should  be fine  his publicist  never gave  serious  any other  clients  in the  serious  history  until today  I got  well that  was fun  we had a  great time  why don't you  call her back  see how it  went  calling back  they're on  their way  to Los Angeles  well they're  doing the  letterman  then LA  oh you  can't call  the publicist  back and say  did that go  well  what I do  is like  find why  breathe 
[03:16:00]  the glass  breathe  a little bit  let it breathe  let the  afternoon  I don't think  we did anything  wrong  even he knew  about the  posters  but let's be  honest with  each other  we're not  romcom guys  he's the  king of  the romcom  he's made  a lot of  money off  those  so we're  goofing on  the poster  a little bit  and then we  got the info  out about  his movie  he's a lawyer  for the first  time since  the time to  kill  yeah  his romcoms  are excellent  though I love  them  come on  I'm trying to  think  which one did I 
[03:16:30]  see  the one with  Kate Hudson  oh that was  fool's gold  no I didn't see  that one  the other one  how to lose a  guy  oh how to lose  a guy in 10 days  that was alright  how does that cover  look like by the way  how to lose a guy in 10  oh look at that  they're leaning  they're leaning  he's leaning  he's leaning  he's leaning  here is Jodie Foster  yeah  saying what  what  they might still be 
[03:17:00]  listening  he said  I can smell your  holy crap  feet  look he's leaning  and he's firmly in  pockets  and he's a big  Texas Longhorn fan  too  oh is he  if it went well  if it went well  what happens  for our show  yeah  what do we get  who else do they have  major A-listers  like who  from Tom Cruise  to Will Smith  on down the line  well we're the  on down the line  people 
[03:17:30]  yeah we're not  Tom Cruise  coming in here  who wants to talk  for his mission  impossible  Will Smith  Tom Cruise  will never  talk to us  Will Smith  will never talk to us  yeah that one  I booked Will Smith  but you guys  didn't want to wait  to one o'clock  to interview  why would we  want to  it's Will Smith  who cares  what has he really  done  will Will Smith  put on the  fart mask  I'm just  fucking around  you want to put  the fart mask  on  Tom Cruise  will be like  yeah let's put  the fart mask  on  I love the  fart mask  I love the  Robert Kelly 
[03:18:00]  one we did  car crash  that one  worked out  real well  is that up  on the  Facebook page  I think my  favorite thing  about the  fart mask  is that  you almost  think that it  didn't work  when you're  on the  receiving end  because you're  like no I  didn't get it  no no no  because it  hits you all  at once  right  and you know  how we always  have to try to  make top  ourselves  gotta get a  homeless guy  to fart  we have to  get a  we have any  homeless guys  around these  days 
[03:18:30]  no  yeah we gotta  find new  homeless guys  we have to  get a homeless  guy to do  the fart  we don't have  any on the  I mean he'll  do the farting  obviously  and then  Robert Kelly  has to be  on the  you know what  I almost think  homeless farts  don't smell as  bad because  they don't have  to eat  they're eating  raw raffes  and shit  oh he ate  salad and do it  for someone  but I would  have to think  that someone like  Roland would probably  have a lot more  digestion going on  I shut down the  bathroom here once  just saying  you're dead  yeah  and you know  you know your  formula to get  a good fart out  I know  formula to get  a massive shit  out too yes  so when are you 
[03:19:00]  gonna want to  do it tomorrow  sure  all right  we'll try to do  the fart mask  tomorrow  pepperoni and  eggs  and some  some of those  awful juice  things I see  you drinking  oh yes  it looks like  someone blended  up some  some construction  paper  colored  yeah  colored  construction  paper  oh we can  all use it  opa stop  what  Facebook page  is opa and  Anthony by the  way  for all the  shit that's 
[03:19:30]  going on with  this show  it's a good  place  yeah  all right  I think  the Matthew  McConaughey  did well  I know  Roland was  nervous  I was  I thought  it was  funny  he sounded  like he was  having fun  he knows  about the  posters  we promised  Roland that  we'd be on  our best  behavior  that's why  I brought  up the  Leno stuff  to say  look  we're just  we're just  we're just  all hanging  together  and there  was no  surprises  there  I said  I was  going to  talk about  it  I wasn't  told not  to  I was  told  to be  good  I think  it was  fine  I think  he'll be  happy  with it  that was  a memorable  interview 
[03:20:00]  for him  he ain't  stopping  by  and he  knows  people are  stealing  his  back to  back  with the  bitch  poster  other people  are doing  it  and they're  confusing  him  that's  his  thing  I think  well I  want to  leave you  all with  this  yeah  trolls  beware  what are  we supposed  to be  aware of  I don't  know  hey  yeah 
[03:20:30]  hey it's  for horses  pigs like  it too  just  blurred  anything out  of it  it works  yeah  boring  boring  yeah  turd  turd  turd  did he say  turd  I can't  find  turd  winning  turd  we did  it  there's  nothing  else  to play  today  unless our  producer  has something  there  Travis you got  anything  were we winning  today 
[03:21:00]  no  we weren't  winning today  oh well  on the air  yeah  oh we lost  we lost  the Brie Olsen  argument  turds  so you're not  going to hear  Brie Olsen  no you will  you'll just  hear a different  interview  yeah but is  the other stuff  worth playing  yeah that's good  it's alright  yeah it's alright  it's not the  you know  no one's ejaculating  top choice  no one's coming  we're done  we're gonna start  developing the  10 o'clock hour  though  it starts today  so uh  you know  give it some  time to develop  but we're gonna  try uh  some other things 
[03:21:30]  finally  experiment  what are you doing  for the 10 o'clock  hour  what  how is he  this motherfucker  getting more air  time  we talked about  it in the meeting  he was asleep  oh  that's right  oh shit  Ant's hearing this  for the first time  this is brand new  to me  this is great  that's just great  Ant  by the way  you did  I don't know  if we said it  on the air  but you told me  off air  that the only  thing you were  gonna ask  Matthew McConaughey  was about his  movie poster  just so everyone 
[03:22:00]  else knew  yeah  we should have  probably said it  up ahead of time  with the listeners  but  he was on hold  so we couldn't  let the listeners  in on it  but you said  I'm only gonna  ask about movie  posters  or keep bringing  it back to movie  posters  have to  and I think  you succeeded  love the movie  poster  yes Sam  well we're gonna  play Brie Olsen's  latest appearance  so her 2009  appearance  when she was in  for an interview  she talked about  oh is that the one  where she took  that big fucking  dildo up the  asshole  no you're thinking  of  and then Earl  licked it clean  or something 
[03:22:30]  no  she left her clothes  on and just  oh wait wait  she pissed  all over  Iraq  right  I don't think so  hopefully not  I mean we haven't  why hopefully not  it's not in the note  well because we  couldn't air that  why couldn't we  that would be  bodily fluids  oh  oh she blows  a snot rocket  on master pole  I don't think  I don't think we  can air snot  bodily fluids  wait till they  tell us  I'll deflect it  wait till they tell us  we can't do the  farm ass thing anymore  wait for that  you're not even 
[03:23:00]  allowed to work up  a sweat in here  yeah  that's bodily fluid  I think  flood  some flood  we'll also air the  tree fort richard  first tree fort richard  story  oh that is a classic  and after my dream  see cause  we referenced that  today  yeah  anthony with the gun  and wearing the  tuxedo is becoming  a screen  a home screen  now  it's a new sensation  it's a great picture  it's me  very angrily  pointing a pistol  at the camera  coke logic  is that coke logic  oh god 
[03:23:30]  coke logic  oh it's animated  wow that looks like  that looks like  a movie poster  that looks cool as shit  I'm back to back  with the gun  and I'm going  oh you're gonna  shoot you  and the gun's like  oh you better  give me bullets  where is it  on his twitter  coke logic on twitter  he just tweeted  talk motherfucker  it's anthony  based on the picture  from his compound show  in a tuxedo  pointing a gun  at the camera  I thought it was  a screen cap  from Reservoir Dogs  I know  it really does look  like fucking  Buscemi  ready to  wow man  he's got your  animation down 
[03:24:00]  yeah he really does  that's good  don't you point that  gun at my dad  daddy  he admitted  he can't figure out  mine  he's tried a few  different ones  he just can't figure it out  it's supposed to be  fucking professionals  but he's got you down  alright  yeah that is good  I'm gonna use that  anthony referenced  Tree 4 Richards  so now we play that  at 10 o'clock  that's sort of  the vibe we're doing  now  I had a dream  we're trying to make  the 10 o'clock hour  make sense to the  show you just heard  and we'll re-air  that clip  in case anybody  missed it  of anthony  pointing a gun  at his screen  in reference to 
[03:24:30]  a caller  a real gun  and I got a couple  other clips  from live from  the compound  oh good  little bonus  I was very angry  at the callers  and then it turned out  to be my fault  it was the phones  and I settled in  pretty quickly though  and accept blame  see if we keep  talking then  Sam doesn't get  to do anything  I know  I'm still here though  which could be  really good for the  audience but  the audience loves me  they love you  yeah  alright so the show  continues sort of  after these messages  Sam and Eric 
[03:25:00]  it's after  Opie and Anthony live  I'm Sam Roberts  Opie and Anthony  well they've left  they go at 10 o'clock  and they don't stick  around for longer  after that  but we're all here  I'm still here  E-Rock is still here  Danny  Travis  Troy  D-Boy  we all stick around  so we figured  why not  keep the channel  on live  we'll still be  playing some  worst of bits  to give you guys  your fill  but we'll also 
[03:25:30]  be playing some  stuff that you  might not hear  normally  some stuff that  goes on in the  hall  I'd really like to  get an update  from Roland  I want to find out  whether or not  Matthew McConaughey's  people are going to  be pissed off  that Anthony  decided to end  the show by  simply interviewing  Matthew McConaughey  based on movie  posters  so we'll go a little  more in depth  that way with stuff  that goes on on the  show but the big  deal on the show  today was obviously  what we started  the first hour with  and that was  the Charlie Sheen  saga dumping out  into Charlie Sheen's  Ustream show 
[03:26:00]  the epic fail  as it were  that was  Charlie Sheen's  Ustream show  the one good thing  about Charlie Sheen's  Ustream show  was the opportunities  that it gave  us here at the  Opie and Anthony  show to parody  and Opie and Anthony  both did not wait  till Monday  to get their parodies  in  as a matter of fact  Anthony was actually  simulcasting  as he talked about  at the top of the  show  he was simulcasting  Charlie Sheen's  Ustream  with his Ustream  live from the  compound  he was playing  a drinking game 
[03:26:30]  that he had to  drink  first it was  every time  Charlie Sheen  said winner  you had to  drink  then it became  every time  Charlie Sheen  did a hashtag  he had to  drink  he was wearing  a tuxedo  and had a pistol  on him  so obviously  it was  live from the  compound  that was not  to be missed  but this is  Anthony  trying to  keep up  with Charlie Sheen  and the  winner  drinking game  if you'll notice  as the winner  winner winner  picks up  there is some  silence  that would be 
[03:27:00]  because there's  a drink in  Anthony's mouth  and I think  that if you  just bear with us  we will  work out the  kinks  kinks  it's going off  without a hitch  Charlie  without a hitch  you're our hero  winning  winning  winning  something like  this  this has not  been seen yet  I'm unveiling  this  for the first  time  what's he doing  I'm live  there it is  can we see it  no  what  did he get  did he get 
[03:27:30]  attacked there  oh my god  we're seeing this  he's under his  own logo  yes it is  winning  no way  he did that  what  because guess  what we're doing  ladies and gentlemen  holy shit  holy shit  winning  drink  drink  everyone out there  who thinks that  they've been winning  along with us  winning  this entire movement  that is in fact  winning  winning  drink  and I want you  to join our chant  winning  winning 
[03:28:00]  winning  winning  winning  winning  winning  winning  winning  winning  winning  winning  holy shit  even I wasn't  expecting that  and he was  indeed  how can you  not love  the excitement  that that  Charlie Sheen  Ustream  brought out  in Anthony  I mean he's  sitting there  just drinking  every time  they're saying  that's why  you couldn't  hear him  because they  just kept  repeating  winner  and Anthony 
[03:28:30]  kept the  beer mug  to his lips  there was one  moment  and we're  going to get  to something  in a minute  because everybody  was talking  about Brie  Olsen  she wasn't  on the  Ustream  and  E-Rock  we were  supposed to  play a  couple of  Brie Olsen  clips  that's not  happening  no we were  supposed to  play Brie  with our  old intern  Cream Pie  Jones  and Black  Earl  formerly of  this show  and Ron  and Fez  ok but we  cannot play  those  we are not  allowed to  ok so instead  can we play  her last  interview she  did in here  that is 
[03:29:00]  perfectly fine  oh fantastic  I love it when  you talk to me  like that E-Rock  so before we  do that though  this if you  didn't hear it  this morning  as we were  talking about  Anthony was  on live from  the compound  his web show  over the  weekend  and not  only this  was after  he had  imbibed  quite a bit  after he  was playing  his drinking  game  and all the  listeners at  home were  as well  drinking every  time Charlie  Sheen did  something that  could be a  hashtag  the phones  started having  problems  at live from  the compound  and he got 
[03:29:30]  upset when  one of the  callers couldn't  hear him  he ended up  pulling a gun  on his camera  pointed basically  at the  caller and  this is what  it sounded  like we'll  play Brie  Olsen's last  appearance right  after this  anyway what do  you have for  this evening  did you watch  the Charlie  Sheen  Sheen's corner  with a K  all right he's  everyone's Ron  Bennington  don't listen  don't listen to  what's coming out  of whatever  listening device 
[03:30:00]  you're listening  to aside from  your phone just  listen to me  talking in your  phone and answer  it when that  happens okay  oh my god  oh my god  is it  look motherfucker  look motherfucker  talk talk  you fucking  fuck  are you sure  it's their  problem and not  ours  holy shit  I'm talking  listen to the  phone  not the 
[03:30:30]  computer  your phones are  fucked  no they're not  I hear  is there  something wrong  oh maybe it's  my fault  can you hear me  yes I can hear  you but it's  there we go  much better  holy crap  wait what  now you hear me  oh maybe it's  my fault  okay look  I didn't mean  to um  all right  all right  hold on  not hold on  I hung up  I didn't mean  to pull a gun  on you  by the way  it was my  fault  you gotta love  that even  when he makes 
[03:31:00]  a mistake as  big as pulling  a gun on  someone and  is big enough  to apologize  put on  something hot  hey uh  we got some  hot  are we allowed  to call them  porn stars  I don't know  where we're at  some adult  adult film stars  some get mad  how about just  adult film  let's call them  helpers  people who help  people help  people that help  get the poison  I'm very excited  did you walk over  with them Jimmy  of course I did  what were the guys  did you just watch  guys gawking  I was just chatting  with pre-all 
[03:31:30]  no no were you  watching like guys  just gawking at them  were the guys just  I didn't look  uncontrolled  see that would have  been I would have  done a social  experiment and just  looked at the guys  looking at these  girls because they  probably would have  you know tripped  over their own  dicks  the only guy I  looked at looking  at the girls was  the fucking creep  that that mr.  whipple headed  guy who I suspect  is a pederast  who just stares at  everybody when we  walk in  fucking he's  obsessed with our  show  like the guy at  the sushi place  he's the worst  there's a guy  why'd they move her 
[03:32:00]  yeah why'd they move  her what the hell  I'm fucking married  I got excited  I was I couldn't  breathe correctly  she was sitting  right next to me  and now she's way  over there  now you just made  my reality reality  just far away  hi miss  sorry  I'm divorced  and I'm afraid  that it's just  gonna be  just like  desperation  in my eyes  right now  yeah Mark's  going through  you know  very tough  time  very tough  I'll be alright  I'll be alright  though  I'm gonna be okay  so  tough times  that's the look  you're seeing  in his eyes  yeah yeah  it's just  the pain  despair  do any of you guys 
[03:32:30]  want to melt  this ring down  for anything  what do you mean  that's his wedding ring  and he wants you  to melt it  saying that he  doesn't want to be  married anymore  gazing upon your beauty  what do we want  to do with that  wedding ring  I got some ideas  put it in  oh god  you gotta love  a sick mind  I got some ideas  it's for the show  though  you can tell  it was for the show  it's for the show  and then it comes  back a different color  yeah well  adult film star  yes  yeah 
[03:33:00]  that's me  Jiminy Cricket  adult film star  Brie Olson  and we also have  Caden Cross here  hi  hi  are you the more shy  of the two Caden  always  why are you so shy  um  I'm not sure  you sound like De Niro  I know  she's actually a better  interview than he is  already  that fucking  mumbling idiot  he is  the 9-11  De Niro stinks  it wasn't the 10th  thank you  stupid  I don't get shyness  cause like you're naked  and that doesn't bother you  as far as being shy 
[03:33:30]  but something like this  is like  yeah like I can walk  naked down  you know  fucking  it's the avenue  and I couldn't  really  okay let's  let's go with that  isn't that weird  I love it though  I love that she's shy  I mean I love a confident  girl but  you know a nice shy one  just hey  and then she takes her  clothes off  takes her clothes off  and punches you in the face  calls you a faggot  do you do hardcore porn  or do you do softcore  yeah I do hardcore  ooh  ooh  Jimmy what is the definition 
[03:34:00]  of hardcore porn  hard cocks  in mouth  or in vagina  I would say  money shots  money shots  and probably open  open vagina licking  I would say  they don't show in softcore  do they  hate that  no  I bet they don't show it  I think it's hardcore  what's that  if you can see pink  oh okay  ass licking  things like that  that is yeah  but in the softcore  you mean like hotel room porn  sure  where you're sitting there  like just move the camera  move  yeah  they keep panning back  to the guy's dumb face  you know what  worst fucking thing ever  is when you're trying  to scrap one out  and they go to the guy's face 
[03:34:30]  going like  and then they go  the same shot again  there's no girls  fucking masturbating  to this  or a very small percentage  let's say  mostly guys in a hotel room  jacking it  and then they gotta show  the guy's face  why  the angle of the guy's  asshole and peach  slapping  oh the bob shot  we call that  back of balls  it's just balls slapping  and you know his asshole  had some shit in it  cause it just all wrinkled  Jesus Bobby  wow  there's ladies in the room  why the hell would you watch that anyway  you suck the sexiness 
[03:35:00]  out of the room  like a fucking spaceship  no that's what I meant  I was like  I don't like that shit  I don't like when they show  the fucking guy's asshole  but once in a while  if you watch those  softcore  they will show  like a dick in the mouth  for a few seconds  they almost keep giving you  these little treats  they just show the hand though  they don't  they'll show everything  it's like a hardcore shot  that was edited differently  why would anyone watch that  in a hotel  unless they didn't have  wifi at the hotel  you can just go online  over the years  not now  now you don't  yeah it's getting better  this is good  with the hot girls  let's get to know the girls

[03:43:00]  and he's never seen it  it's always been behind him  oh there's hair on it  and it's never been white  and it's never been a strap on  that's right  and it's never been  that small or thin  it wasn't  it didn't have straps  no  he just had hips  and a guy torso  and a hairy chest  we gotta  we gotta get a video  we gotta get a video made today  we can get a guy  with a fucking  yeah put a bag over his head  or something  give him a  do something  whatever he wants  a lap dance  a lap dance  I've never gotten one  you've never gotten a lap  isn't it your birthday 
[03:43:30]  no  wow  wow  good improv  never deny  what was it  Sam  Sam was saying that  if we bring somebody up  off the street  we do have a spare bunny mask  we can put on  to find his anonymity  we'll look like the shining  yeah exactly  do you have any O&A fans  that are just running  to walk by the street  putting a suit on  yeah just putting a suit on  and just walking back and forth  would you  you're married  look at that  look at that big guy right there  look he's  that is fantastic 
[03:44:00]  you sir  the galoot  yeah  the one taking up  the whole bench  yeah we got that  oh that's fantastic  we got the black  Marty Feldman  look at this guy  look at the guy  in the kilt  look at the guy  in the front  my buddy in the kilt  little Boston guy  with his wife  right here  this guy  yeah  what about you sir  you know  now you can't do it  cause your girl's right there  well how about our  fucking mess intern  what if she gave you  permission  would you do it  I say we go with  Joe Businessman  with a ring  Danny go down the street  let's feel this out  at least  alright  call the show 
[03:44:30]  and talk to guys  walking by with wedding rings  yeah  tell them we might have  a special  I wanna see if these guys  can be touching  but make sure it's not  a good wedding ring  like with a lot of diamonds  and they have a lot of money  make sure it's like  a shitty wedding ring  you know he's depressed  he's got no money  he needs it  like a rusty  fucked up wedding ring  alright  why don't you go downstairs  should I bring Sam  to get the video  on the street  or is that too conspicuous  you think  we'll see if the guy  in mind  could document the whole thing  I would be amazed  if someone comes up  on the street  if not we got an intern 
[03:45:00]  would you  I'd be fucking amazed  if they didn't  oh my gosh  really  yeah  I wanna pee before  this happens  in a second  yeah I gotta pee too  I have to pee before  it happens  cause if any cum comes out  then it hurts  if I haven't peed yet  do you ever jerk off  and then pee  and it hurts  cause the cum  is like  what happened  well Sam was mentioning  he asked if we should  bring Brie  so that they can see  what they're getting  or maybe print that  a picture or something  no I think  we  bring the box down  cause anything in front  of the fucking door  oh Jimmy  I gotta try and take a shit  are you going to pee 
[03:45:30]  right now Jimmy  can I come  I'm gonna go pee  with Jimmy  everyone's peeing  me and Jimmy  are gonna go  suck each other off  oh god  does that work  within your marriage  if you blow Jimmy  yeah I can blow Jimmy  I did  I hit it already  unbelievable  this one  I gotta try and take a shit  I love that one  hey Mark Maron  what are you thinking  what are you thinking  over there  I'm thinking just how  important porn has been  in my life  yeah  over the last 25 years  yeah  you're like  you help out  yeah  really do  girls  big helper 
[03:46:00]  I try  he's having sex  with a black sock  these days  oh that was once  and I just didn't prepare  what are you  I don't know  of any guy  who hasn't scrapped  into their sock  at one point  I don't know  what it is with guys  that they can't just prepare  like you know  you know you're gonna do it  bring a towel  washcloth  some Kleenex  what you gotta dig  into the hamper  like an ass  sometimes you're going  for the quickie  just to get it over  like you're surprising  yourself  like who knew  I was gonna do this  or someone's home  maybe  after I plowed through  a pint of Ben and Jerry's  what a pathetic night  that was last night 
[03:46:30]  you fucked some Ben and Jerry's  no I didn't  I ate the Ben and Jerry's  I assumed you were  fucking your ice cream  I ate the Ben and Jerry's  and that wasn't enough  you know what I'm saying  but I didn't go onto the computer  I didn't use any of your  that's kind of girl like  I went with my mind  not insulting you  but that's kind of girl like  like your emotions  taking it out  by eating ice cream  I'm not embarrassed  about my feminine side  I'm not wearing wigs  or getting fake boobs  I'm eating ice cream  is that so horrible  no I guess you know  but that's like  kind of a girl thing  I sat all night  and just ate ice cream  I felt bad  alright so I have 
[03:47:00]  some food issues  is that going to be a problem  I still jerk off  into a sock  does that count for anything  that's more manly  okay alright  Anthony people are confused  they think this is our  9-11 tribute show  it is  it was  it started that way  and everything changed  we're trying to make  people forget  I know the thing is  never forget  we want people to forget  just for a little while  where can people  see you guys too  because Brie is a real  fucking a trooper  both of them  I'm saying as a personality  it kind of is  because she didn't get  fucked at 9 or 11  she was fucked at 12 
[03:47:30]  kind of a tie in  where's the expo  it's in Edison  yes it is in Edison  New Jersey  it's the New Jersey  convention center  because that faggot  mayor in Secaucus  didn't want the  expo there  oh my goodness  well  that fucking asshole  oh my goodness  you know why  because he looks at  a girl like you  and makes  cumzies in his pants  instantly  he just goes  he looks and goes  and then he goes  I don't want them  in my town  because I make  cumzies  well I don't really 
[03:48:00]  have any opinion  on that  I'm sure he's a lovely man  so how big is the expo  what's going to be there  oh my goodness  it's huge  there's going to be  shows going on  on the stage  would you love to hear  that from her  oh my goodness  it's huge  just that  I would hear  well  we'll work with it  is that it  but there's going to be  a lot of huge stars  there too  Gina Lynn's going to be  there  Stormy  Daniels  Sunny Lane  who I fucking love  Sunny Lane 
[03:48:30]  oh do I like her  is Gage out of the  business  Gage  she has a nice  fat name  I feel like  the little kid  from Pet Sematary  yes  you got hit by  a big black car  his little shoe  comes off  that was mine  give me that bar  my shoe and my wig  I tried to bring  my wig back to life  I feel like  I'm out of the loop  with professional porn  I find myself  looking at all the 
[03:49:00]  amateur bullshit porn  I gotta get up to speed  that's my favorite  kind though  I love amateur porn  five minutes of  amateur porn  is great  I don't know  who any of these  people she's talking about  I like classic  I love the classic  I love the scenario  it was on film  like when women  had hair on the top  big fucking hairy  back in the day  hey son  can you come here  and help me  with this plant  dad  where half of the time  he's eating pussy  is spent with those  fingers pulling hair away  like trying to find it 
[03:49:30]  and then you look at it  it's like roadkill  it looks like fucking  13 day roast beef  it just has that  rainbow on it  it's like fucking  Reginald Denny's head  when I was 14  I grew up in New Mexico  and everybody  you got your driver's license  when you're 15  in Albuquerque  so we all had fake IDs  at 15  and we all had the same  fucking name on the ID  because the guy who made them  would come with a board  that you'd hold in front of your head  at a party  so it was all the same information  and we go to this place  called the Pyramid Theater 
[03:50:00]  which was this porno theater  we had four 15 year old guys  with all of us  Tom Bynes  and we walk in  Tom Bynes  and I remember seeing  the first porno I saw  it must have been like  I don't know when it was made  in the mid 70s  and all I know is it ended  with a woman on a  it had some sort of weird  occult theme to it  and some guy was on a bus  and some woman picks him up  and they go back to her apartment  and she takes her clothes off  and she's got the face  of the devil  tattooed to where the pussy  is the devil's mouth  nice 
[03:50:30]  and the guy's fucking her  and she's going  fuck me  fuck Satan  and I'm 15  I'm like is this how it goes  is this how  am I missing something  is this what I have to look forward to  who put the fucking  history channel on  they're showing 9-11  put something else  we said change the channel  so they go to the history channel  I don't want to see the buildings  good odds that the history channel  would have something on this today  I know  Jesus  it's called the history channel  yeah  I'm amazed that the post  didn't do nothing on it  that was amazing  that the post didn't have the cover story  putting a picture of a pig  with lipstick on 
[03:51:00]  I like the old pornos  but some of the guys  there was a guy named Arbola  who was a porn star  he was in a lot of them  and he looked like fucking Robert Duvall  he was balding  in his 40s  I remember that guy  he was the worst  who were the other ones  Mark Wallace  Tom Byron  Mark Wallace has the hiv  he's done right  he's got the virus  Tom Byron I actually met  he's got a gut now  he's a big tough crowd fan  he's got a fucking goatee  Peter North looks the same  he's still fucking shooting  really  like 8 gallons of jizz  oh he's got a  fucking intimidating cocky  who's that guy  he's a real evil guy 
[03:51:30]  not  what's  Max Hardcore  who's the guy  with his little hat  and his little feet  who's the dude  that was in opening  opening of Misty Beethoven  what was that guy's name  Jeremy  oh shit  did you ever see that movie  opening of Misty Beethoven  did you ever see the one  I forget who it was  Ginger Lynn  I think it was  she was  her boyfriend  her boyfriend was a comic  and he was bombing  at this hell gig  she's in the back  getting fucked  and sucking dick  by the other two guys  and while he's on there bombing 
[03:52:00]  and then he comes off  and knocks on the door  he's like honey  wants to talk about his set  how bad it went  and she goes  close your eyes  I'm gonna do that thing to you  that you've always liked  but keep your eyes shut  and the guy finishes on her ass  and they sneak out  right past him  and then he goes in  with his eyes closed  and she's still got jizz  on his ass  that's my biggest fear in comedy  I'm gonna be up at the cellar  one night bombing  and your boyfriend  will knock on the door  and then you'll  and then you'll open it  you're losing the girls  yeah I know right 
[03:52:30]  she backed off from the mic  she's sitting back  don't fucking blame me  what are you doing  I'm trying to add to the fucking show  I'm telling you  I was just thrown off  by the Sesame Street  a little bit  well you know why  because 9-11  ain't gonna be on Sesame Street  you can rest assured  she was watching the first time  she was 12  yeah exactly  hey where's Danny  I thought he was gonna be  on the street  he was supposed to be  bringing the people up here  you one of those  stars that have like  a boyfriend husband thing  because that's always odd to me  no 
[03:53:00]  no  no  oh good girl  what about you  do you have a boyfriend  why don't you talk to her  I can't do it  you can't do it  what happens  I can't have boyfriends  it's impossible  really  because when they get a little jealous  it's not even a jealousy thing  it's just  well it's timing  I mean  we work constantly right  yeah  do you ever fuck a married guy  never actually  unless  unless a porn star  I'm sure there's a couple married guys  but you never would like  you never fucked like a legit married guy  like a square  no  would you  could you go out with a porn star though 
[03:53:30]  I mean  my buddy  my buddy used to go out with a dominatrix  and they'd be out to dinner  and her page would go off  and she'd go  oh I gotta go piss on this banker's head  good  hilarious  how great is that  I'll be back in an hour  I'd buy her the Fiji water  would you  fuck yeah  I dated the girl who did some porn in LA  it didn't bother me at all  yeah  it's kind of like cuckold though  no thank you  go down to the set and watch her work  no I didn't  hey look 
[03:54:00]  that's my girl sucking that dick  no no no  that ain't mine  that's better than like  yeah okay I'll watch the kid  I'll see you when you come back  it didn't bother me  we had very tender nice sex  did you  yeah  that's what she said  no I was  kissing and loving  what kind of sex do you like having  do you like having  you know in your personal life  it really just depends on the mood  I like it all  I would talk dirty  I would say some sexy stuff  like  take that dick  but it seems like you'd want something a little different than the  you know what you do at work  yeah that's true  and that's the case most of the time 
[03:54:30]  but sometimes I you know still  can I ask some novice questions  because I'm like new to this game here  now  the wee wee goes in her wee wee  okay  so that's how it starts  yes  when you do movies  do you come for real  yes  I'm very very sensitive  oh yeah every time  seriously  seriously  seriously  I didn't at first  it was hard at first  because there's like you know  15 people watching you  right  but then you just kind of  get in the zone  the cum zone  yeah I get to the point  where I don't notice  I've had them leave  and come back  and I didn't know  it just  wow 
[03:55:00]  my penis would wilt  under that pressure  horribly  I'm just happy to know  that they do  we got Danny on the street  let's see where  if he's had any luck  hey Danny what's going on  that's a damn good point  not much man  it's uh  it's you know  I could never in a million years  imagine it was this hard  to pick a guy up  of course it is  come get laid by a gorgeous form star  they don't believe it  I'm really trying to sell this  and uh 
[03:55:30]  people think that  they don't believe it  we're meeting  and I'm whipping out her picture  I'm like  this girl is upstairs right now  and you could totally  Danny  Danny  can you tuck your hair  into your hat  yeah maybe  maybe it's you  that's  you look like a guy  who just got kicked  out of clown college  you have Gallagher  trying to sell pussy  on the street  yeah I wouldn't come up  with him either  who would  I think  you want to fuck  a porn star  he just committed  a sodomy  no  she's dead  yeah you gotta send  somebody down  what about the guy  in the kilt  we found Kenny out here 
[03:56:00]  you want Kenny to do it  Danny  what she's not wearing  underpants  no  do you like being spanked  yeah  I'm a very good spanker  yeah Jimmy would like  to smack you  just for a second  yeah you want to right now  okay yeah I'll show you  how this is my technique  you all shaved  you all shaved  um  yeah  well I kind of slacked  because I'm not shooting  right now  that's kind of cool  this is how I do it  okay  you straighten your arm  yeah  and you go stiff like this  that looks ridiculous  that was the most  um  aggressively weird 
[03:56:30]  spanking you've ever had  I  you know  it was lovely  it was lovely  that's a great visual  I like giving retard arm  when I spank  I got it  Danny  we want to hear you  try to ask someone  live on the show  I can do that  I'm really thinking  this is probably  going to work better  if we had  said goods  out on the street  hey Brie  how about if you  just openly ask  these guys  if you want to  I got to find one  that like meets  the criteria  I saw she's not naked  what is um  can I ask a question

[04:07:00]  they hold it  at the base  and it's like  that fucking awful  fake  you're giving away  porn  no I don't know  that shit is real  most of them are  why is this called  come bath  by the way  oh  I guarantee  there's a little  hose in there  that shoots  a come bath  yeah  like a ridiculous  amount  like it's like  a shower  like fire hose  it looks like a  honey bun  yeah  you're using the  wrong water fountain  boy  I remember that day  I do  I would think you  would  how did you 
[04:07:30]  forget that  a lot of them  I do forget  but that one  was about two  months into the  industry  I'd only been in  about two months  is that some sort  of rites of passage  an initiation  it looks like  it's really  but really  it's only  this much  is in there  and it's just  going back and  forth  right now  we're sitting  by the way  she's on our  hands and knees  with her face  in the bed  there's a black  guy putting  what looks like  a massive  dick inside  and he's spanking  her  but apparently  it's a fake  penis  it's very shiny  it's too shiny 
[04:08:00]  it's not going  all the way in  and the base  is too shiny  you should not  be able to  see yourself  in a cock  it's too shiny  you've got a  great fuck ass  though  what a perfect ass  that is just  a great  great fucking  going on  I like the way  her neck  is bent  all the way  back  and his big  dumb shiny  fake plastic  penis  is really  yeah  ain't even real  look at the fucking  how perfect  that ass is  it's Keith Robinson  it's Keith Robinson  god damn it  I'll fuck you  for Philly  Philly  I don't pay 
[04:08:30]  for nothing  oh my god  come bath  where's the come bath  wow  was that in your butt  oh no  it wasn't in my ass  I probably would have  taken it better  in my ass  than my pussy  though  look at my face  I'm like  fuck this  where's the come bath  is that what that was  yeah basically  fake rubber cock  now you're sucking on it  did that taste  like a telephone  yeah that's about  what it tasted like  that's how I would  describe it  how mad was that guy  that he had to put  a fake dick in your  mouth while he's  naked  how embarrassing 
[04:09:00]  is that  oh yeah  look at this  oh I gotta see  the come bath  this is  watch it squirt out  what is it  what do they use  yeah what do they use  it's like a pina colada mix  who is that  it's a crispy cream machine  that's so fucking impossible  you know  Jesus  look at how much  it's coming out  it's ridiculous  now we know  what it's called  come bath  yeah  wait the guy left the room  the dick is still coming  it's like the fucking  this is just silly  it's like the vomit scene  in the fucking  yeah  Monty Python 
[04:09:30]  no  I was thinking  Exorcist  no I was thinking  uh  uh  fuck  is that sugar  no  uh  the puppets  like pina colada mix  oh um  yeah  team America  you guys would be surprised  on how many people  email me  and say  hey I seen you  on this site  is that really real  and you know  people ask all the time  that's crazy  how many of the guys  you gotta dream  those people  that guy would  if that was real  he would get a girl  pregnant every time  he fucked  just shooting it up  into a fucking  and then give her 
[04:10:00]  an abortion  immediately after  fucking 13 twins  stuck together  we're getting away  from the crush thing  and I can't let this  go  and Brie  why don't you eat  your fucking yogurt  now I'll be  yeah  very funny  I can be funny  Brie also said earlier  that you're available  and looking right  oh  remember the last time  that happened  she said she's  available and looking  and we just  brushed by that  and we're also 
[04:10:30]  finding out  that she has  a crush  on someone  in this room  nothing  what's wrong  Danny  not right  Danny  people are gay  maybe they're  just going to work  nobody wants to get laid  that's okay  I'd rather fuck  my crush anyways  so  oh  oh  shit  oh shit  oh shit  motherfucker  no you didn't  who the fuck  eeny meeny  miny mo  oh shit  nigga please  somebody in this room  eeny meeny  miny mo  yes  I love Danny 
[04:11:00]  saying everyone's gay  well maybe they have morals  or maybe they're just going to work  maybe they weren't anticipating  yeah but that's what I'm saying  like some guys are like  fucking a porn star  they're like oh I gotta go to a meeting  and I'm just like what fucking meeting  is more important than this  yeah why not lose your job for this  the best part about Danny down there  was every time somebody said no  as they were walking away  while they were clearly still in earshot  Danny said  they said no  it must be gay or something  and homo said no  of course 
[04:11:30]  you gotta crush on Sam  no that's obvious  no it was someone that was in the room already  I guess  well Sam was in the room  yeah but no no  it was in the room at that moment  I think  at that moment  so I don't think it's Sam  Danny  Danny wasn't in the room  Brie you gotta crush on Danny  she keeps looking at the publicist  like I'm gonna kill you  maybe this is how we get something going  maybe you're like really shy  and you would have never  you know done anything with this crush  um you're probably right 
[04:12:00]  that is so weird  can we just speed the crush up  it's like everyone's  everyone's holding their lottery tickets  but they're not giving the numbers out  nobody wants to open the Wonka bar  and look  for the golden ticket  yeah  cause you can fucking  grandpa has bed sores  a bunch of guys  are just gonna be sitting here  with chocolate bars  and one is gonna be  you did it Charlie  balls deep  it's a  wow  it's a little Jimmy Norton  is it 
[04:12:30]  wow  it has to be said  yes  it just has to be said  I would think it was Jimmy  what's not to like about little Jimmy though  cause he's uh  he's cute  he's got the little lips  that he likes to lick  and make him shiny  what do you like about Jimmy Brie Olsen  everything  it's out  now you gotta talk about it  is that true  or are they just going into the box  what makes you think that is Jimmy for  look at Jimmy right  look at Jimmy  look at Jimmy  Brie look at Jimmy  she can't even look at you  look at Jimmy  look at Jimmy in the eye  she's not

[04:16:30]  speak openly  your publicist already said  when you were in the bathroom  that it's Jimmy  so  oh my god  she ratted you out  in a second  the second that door shut  she went  it's over  it's Jimmy  I knew I shouldn't have  left the room  but I had to go so bad  what do you like about Jimmy  still can't look at you  by the way Jimmy  oh that's so cute  how cool is this  puppy love  puppy love  wow  no it's probably that  everyone is so wrong  and she doesn't want to  look at my dumb face  I'm like yeah really  Jimmy  always thinking that

[05:01:00]  three  and some big guy  will say hey  get your hands off  yeah exactly  just like a strip club  why don't you bring  somebody famous in too  just to take all the  girls away from me  how old are you  I'm surprised  you're 22  you're 22  you have a boyfriend  hi  it's hard to have  a boyfriend  in this industry  really  how are you going  to fight that argument  a lot of guys  are threatened right  I'm not saying  I wouldn't be  it's not threatened  it's just  it's difficult  I work constantly

[05:02:00]  find difficult  to be with you  not the fact  that you're  sucking a cock  no because  I have dated  and they don't  usually have a problem  they don't care  that's cool  I mean I wouldn't  I bet  you get everything  you need  from a boyfriend  at work  exactly  so why bother  do you like women  they're fun  but  they're not fun  if that's all you get  you like to go camping  a guy cooks up  some stuff  no she's talking  she needs cock  at the end of it  she needs some cack

[05:03:30]  because  my only thing is  what if she puts a strap on  and gets you in the bag  and says  call more often  faggot  it would be accurate  that'd be actually  good  that'd be a good idea  little or not  little or not  are you  are you into that  Bree  oh my goodness  you pretend she's Jimmy  we're gonna shave her head  lump her ears up  and take her chin away  no that would be embarrassing
