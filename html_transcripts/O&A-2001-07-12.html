<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a segment featuring women performing simulated orgasms, leading to much playful banter amongst the hosts and crew, and acknowledgment of potential FCC violations. This was followed by listener calls detailing their listening experiences in various settings.  A significant portion of the show then focused on the mysterious disappearance of an intern, Rachel, and the airing of sexually explicit audio recordings from what were allegedly her interview conversations with staff member Rick.

Next, a listener recounted a mishap from the previous day's "What's in My Pants" segment, prompting a replay of the segment.  This segment featured a caller, initially believed to be a woman named Jamie, describing their attire and participating in a guessing game about their pubic hair style. It was later revealed the caller was a man.  The show then included commercial breaks for New York Sports Clubs and Bud Light, updates on an upcoming blind boxing event, and calls to the "F.U." line.  The show concluded the first major segment with a discussion of a lawsuit filed against the station by former employee Psycho Mark, who claimed payment for his participation in various past segments, including for simply laughing in the background.

The next segment heavily featured the aforementioned blind boxing match between Blind Dave and Blind Matt.  The hosts discussed the lawsuit against the show, listener demands for payment for contributions, and a humorous bit about assigning credit for catchphrases.  Bill Dwyer, a commentator from BattleBots, joined to discuss the rules (or lack thereof) for the blind boxing match.  Blind Matt's ability to pop out his prosthetic eyes provided a significant comedic highlight, and his blindness was verified on air.  The segment included digressions into promotional spots for other shows, a John Valby song about genitalia, and further listener calls. The actual fight was set up but not fully detailed in this section, ending with the show preparing for its commencement.

The blind boxing match itself was chaotic and involved frequent accidental contact with bystanders, resulting in an intern being knocked down and Opie being hit in the groin.  The fighters repeatedly left the makeshift ring, and a friend of Blind Dave subtly signaled Dave’s location to Matt. The match ended in a draw, punctuated by the frequent use of profane language, a "FU Line" segment, and advertising for Hotwire and Stacker 2.  A picture of Blind Matt with his prosthetic eye popped out was mentioned as being available online.

The final segment detailed the blind boxing match, with Blind Dave conceding defeat to Blind Matt after a judged decision by Opie, Anthony, and Ben.  Matt gave thanks to God, his family, and apologized to other blind people.  Both fighters gave shout-outs to various sponsors and individuals (Matt to Caro from Vital Transportation, Dave to several businesses).  The broadcast included promotional announcements for the Long Island Bombers beep baseball team, the Park Central Hotel, and Creamfields New York.  Several callers shared their reactions. The show concluded with a discussion of Dave’s injuries (multiple broken ribs), a promised lap dance for Dave, and further humorous banter.  Pictures and videos of the fight were mentioned as being available on WNEW.com.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Here we go. Remember, we've got to tell everyone, because the management down the hall is freaking out.  This is a fake orgasm.  Fake.  Oh, get that camera. Get that goddamn camera.  Ready?  Jesus.  Whenever you're ready.  Ready.  Yeah.  Here goes Wendy. 
[00:00:30]  Oh, get that. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you.  All right, hold on before I get to the third girl.  I can't even clap after that. I have blood left in my body.  It's all somewhere else.  My arms are asleep.  I know.  All right, very good.  Fabulous.  All right, let's go to Stephanie.  You know what to do, right, Steph?  Mm-hmm.  All right, she's got the piercing from earlier.  How's it feeling down there?  It's feeling good.  Yeah? All right.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Oh, f**k me. 
[00:01:30]  Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.  Hold on. We've got to come out of that. Hold on.  All right, hold on.  Stay out of the bushes.  All right, hold on.  Everyone in the studio certainly enjoyed that, but you can't say that. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah, the f**k me harder thing is very lovely and stuff, but nice touch.  I do believe the FCC would find it illegal.  All right, so.  Nice touch.  Nice touch, exactly.  That was nice.  Going for the gold.  All right.  Yeah, sometimes you've got to go above and beyond in Sydney.  All right, you ready to try it again without the cursing?  All right, so here goes Stephanie one more time.  All right.  You've got to beat Irene.  All right. 
[00:02:30]  Wait, hold on. What?  That's in my on-top list.  Doesn't that get some kind of credit?  That certainly does, Opie.  It sure does, yes.  You've got to give her that.  These beautiful things.  I can't believe you guys.  You've got to give her that.  Very nice deez, yes.  Thank you.  Stephanie, you better do a topless just so you're...  All right.  Well, how about I do it?  Kissing Mr. Topless.  All right.  Hey, you know, whatever.  No.  Can we check the rule book on that?  No.  They're setting up scenarios now.  Wait.  Absolutely not.  And bring me that dildo. 
[00:03:00]  Of course.  All right.  So, you're going to do a topless?  I'll do a topless.  I'll do a topless with her.  With...  You know, I'm so confused.  Why don't you all just get topless?  There they go.  There's all our teenagers topless once again.  Yes, there you go.  Stephanie, go ahead.  You've got to get on mic, though.  Remember, this is a fake orgasm.  Yes.  Yes.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, baby. 
[00:04:00]  Baby.  I feel so good.  I feel so good.  Oh, I'm getting too excited.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  What a way to start the show today.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:04:30]  Toll free, 877-692-1027.  That was actual noises from Gary Condon's apartment, Anthony.  He loves the teens.  Yes.  See?  Not just us.  Steve, what's going on?  What's going on, man?  Hey.  Yo, I'm driving down the part of New Jersey.  You almost killed me with that.  The old almost crash.  You almost killed me with that. 
[00:05:00]  I'm driving down and people are looking at me.  It's bumper-to-bumper traffic.  They got their faces all glued to the front of the steering wheel.  It's ridiculous.  I've got my dog in the car.  The dog's howling.  It's going crazy.  Hey, who doesn't love teens?  Nobody.  You don't love teens.  You're just not human.  You're not a man.  All right.  We're going to have teen car wash very, very soon.  We're still looking for a place to hold the teen car wash.  Yes.  It's Tom's River, New Jersey.  Try that place right there.  All right, man.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bill, what's going on?  How you doing, guys? 
[00:05:30]  All right.  I'm going to do the last car on that.  Tom's River is definitely the place to hold that.  Okay.  But you guys are driving me nuts today with that.  That was classic.  Yeah, we want to start strong today.  There you have it.  Absolutely.  You guys rock, man.  All right, Bill.  Thank you.  Nick almost got fired.  Nick, what's going on?  Not much.  I think you guys just ruined my life.  Why?  I left my radio on at work.  I'm probably going to get fired when I get back.  I just fell in love with Irene.  My girl is going to kill me. 
[00:06:00]  You guys are the best.  All right.  Thank you, Nick.  Thank you.  Joe, what's up?  Yeah, I'm at the drive-thru in the bank.  I asked the lady for a deposit slip.  They leave the speaker on.  So I said, what the hell?  I crank it up.  I've never seen so many tellers run to that button as fast as they did.  People in the bank.  You guys are off.  All right, Joe.  Thanks.  Walking around with wood.  I love that bit.  That's a good one.  Yeah.  That one sounded nice.  So what's up, man? 
[00:06:30]  Ran down the hall.  I know.  Time to broadcast.  Lots is up.  Why are they searching Gary Condon's apartment two months too late?  Well, because he's not a suspect.  It's just...  You would have thought they would have, you know, tried to search it a little sooner than this.  People have to realize there has been no crime.  There's no crime here.  It's a missing person.  If they want to search his place, which he gave consent to do, I think the guy's innocent of anything. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, my China, kid.  The guy gives me the creeps.  Yeah.  Yeah, this missing intern.  I wish a few of our own would go missing.  But, yeah, the missing intern.  What?  You have a problem with some of our interns, Ed?  No.  You know me.  You know that we purposely don't have female interns on our show?  Why?  Well, we sacrifice for the listeners so we can, you know, do our jobs.  We have one.  We have one.  That snuck through the cracks. 
[00:07:30]  That's true.  That didn't go through the proper channels.  That was funny.  Very pretty girl.  Rachel.  Beautiful.  Rachel.  And Rick comes in one day and goes, hey, I want you to meet the new intern.  Now, usually when we have interns that are prospects for the show, they're brought into the office.  We meet them.  And then they have a little interview with Rick and whoever.  They go through a whole process.  They have to talk to Rick and Ben.  And then they have to talk to Jeremy, the program director here, and Craig, the assistant pro.  There's a whole process.  And then after a while, if they cut the mustard there, they get brought in and it's like, hey, here's our new intern. 
[00:08:00]  Right.  With Rachel, Rick brings her in and just goes, hey, here's our new intern.  Like there was no process of anything.  Nothing.  And it was the first time we saw her.  It was the first time we saw her.  Right.  Hey, new intern.  Oh, what the hell is going on here?  And then we just go, okay.  We were happy, but we were happy, but pissed at the same time.  Well, it's very distracting when there's, you know, hot women walking around when we're trying to broadcast. 
[00:08:30]  That's all right.  See, we sacrifice.  Yeah.  We know we can't do our jobs if the women are around and they're looking all good and stuff.  Yeah.  All right.  Dan says they should search Gary Ackerman's office while they're at it.  I just have a feeling.  That's true.  We get a lot of calls from Gary Ackerman, who's a congressman out on Long Island.  And he sounds very, very with it.  You know, he likes the show and everything.  And then we looked at a picture of him.  The guy is, he's an old guy. 
[00:09:00]  He's no kid.  No, not at all.  But he's got a great sense of humor, I guess.  Very surprised that he listens to our show.  But yes, search the apartment.  What are you talking about?  What?  Rachel.  What about our...  Rachel never went through the process.  Never went through the channels.  Why, Rick?  Why, Rick?  Let's listen to this load of crap.  Let's hear this.  We've been...  Hold on.  Hold on.  Here is why.  Hold on.  We've been trying to get to the bottom of this for a long time, man.  Filthy whore. 
[00:09:30]  Because you should see...  Here is why.  You should see what these poor interns have to go through just to work for free and get  our stupid coffee.  It's kind of pathetic.  But this girl just marches in and she's great and all.  Get the hell off my obstacle!  That's like what the interns usually have to go through.  Profit Pyle, you're a disgusting fat body!  She's great.  She belongs here and she's intelligent and all that.  But I just know she did not go through the process.  Actually, she did.  She went through the meetings.  But that day, you guys...  What meeting?  No!  I'm a closed door! 
[00:10:00]  What?  Hold on.  Yes, yes.  Hold on.  Here we go.  Wrong.  Try again.  I'm telling you.  Why is Stinky shaking his head and why is Ben shaking his head?  I remember going into Air 2 to edit some bits or whatever.  And you're in there talking to her by yourself.  And I go back to Ben.  I'm like, how come Rick's in there talking to some girl?  Because you guys had the doors closed for something wrong.  I'm going to sit down to edit a piece. 
[00:10:30]  Hold on.  Congressman Rick.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Congressman Rick.  Check his Miata.  Here's the interview process for Rick.  I just want to ask one question.  Okay.  And I'm going to ask it to Ben, okay?  Ben, how many of the interns currently on staff were you involved in the interview process? 
[00:11:00]  Everyone but Rachel.  Right.  Exactly.  You know that's true.  You know that's true.  But like I said, Craig...  And why do we ever meet her?  Craig finds me.  He says, hey, I've got that intern, blah, blah, blah, for the meeting today.  I'm like, where are the other guys?  Oh, the door is closed.  Opie wanted the door closed.  Whatever.  I'm like, fine.  Send whoever it is down.  I've got to edit a bit.  No problem.  I'll just talk to them there.  Oh, because you were editing a bit.  So you figured you'd save time by editing the bit in the private studio while you conducted the interview. 
[00:11:30]  So when did you introduce her to Ben and Stinky?  I don't remember.  Maybe it was the same time we were introduced to her in the office.  No, I think you guys saw her.  What would happen, Rick, if you brought some guy that was going to be an intern into our office and just went, hey, this is the new intern?  We'd be like, what?  We never met him.  You guys met her afterwards, right?  Afterwards.  No, no, no.  Not when you guys met her.  After he got finished.  I'm talking.  You guys met her afterwards. 
[00:12:00]  I spoke with her, right?  You met her that day after the door opened, right?  On her way out?  I don't really.  I just remember going in there and seeing you in the studio by yourself.  What?  There was a mic on during the interview process?  Oh, really?  We have Rick?  Do I make you horny?  Yeah, baby.  Yeah.  Really?  I have some audio.  Oh, because the mic was on.  Here's Rick talking to the intern, right? 
[00:12:30]  Get on your hands and knees like a dog.  That's it.  Fall around like a dog.  That is not what happened.  Do you have more?  All right, here's Rick in the interview process.  Do you like having your background?  No, that didn't happen either.  Pusser!  No?  Shut up, stinky, you ass. 
[00:13:00]  Here's the intern, Rachel, after the interview process.  All right.  You've got some funky tasting spots.  Oh, my God!  Is it true?  Rick was second-guessing himself after she left.  It's illegal, isn't it?  Wow.  More of Rick.  Take your bra off and take it off now!  And here's the intern then leaving, Rachel leaving the office. 
[00:13:30]  We're cakes for nothing!  Here's Rick to Rachel.  Don't just stare at it, eat it.  Oh, no.  That's horrible.  That is not what happened.  It isn't?  No!  There was a reason why we couldn't...  I couldn't do the interview in the office with the guys.  It was because you guys were in there, and you're like,  all these interviews, we don't want to be a part of them. 
[00:14:00]  You guys just deal with it.  All right.  We got some more Rick?  Yeah.  Oh, you're very naughty.  No, this is Rick.  We've got Bush.  We've got Bush.  Is it true it was that time?  Because why else would Rick say this?  Hold the string!  Hold the string!  I don't know.  It was just a very normal intern. 
[00:14:30]  Was that on in the background?  No, it was just...  Rachel, pointing out something to Rick that's a little odd during the interview.  Your balls are showing.  It was your basic intern meeting.  Can I touch it?  No!  All right, Rick.  Well, no.  We got audio.  Now we see it.  It was just an innocent... 
[00:15:00]  It doesn't really matter, you know, how we got her.  She's a good intern.  Yeah.  She's a great intern.  Very eager.  It's in the hose!  All right.  Well, Rick.  I see your legs come back.  Is it over yet?  Doug, what's up?  I heard during Rachel's interview, Rick says,  Don't worry about doing the A, Bs, or Cs. 
[00:15:30]  Just do the Ds.  Later, guys.  Hey, that's good.  That's a good callback right there.  It's actually the Cs.  As a little contrast, we also have audio of Rick's interview with John, the intern.  Okay.  How would you like to mow my lawn?  See, there's a little difference there.  Well, here's Rick with Rachel.  You're a little bitch.  That's right.  You're a bitch, and I'd bet you'd like to suck it, wouldn't you? 
[00:16:00]  Just don't talk that way with people that you want working for you.  It rubs the lotion on its skin.  It does this whenever it's told.  It's very inappropriate the way you were dressed when she first walked in.  Hello, cutie pie.  Now we're having fun.  Yeah, we sure are.  If I said you had a beautiful body, would you take your pants off and dance around a little?  Here's Rachel. 
[00:16:30]  How would you like to suck my ass?  Your clothes.  Give them to me.  Now.  Wow, this is going to be a great callback line.  Paul, what's up?  What's up?  Rick, did you offer a drink?  You know, coffee, tea, or me?  Yes.  Nice.  Bravo to Paul.  Shut up!  Dick!  All right, great.  Why would you ask this, Rick?  I find the most erotic part of a woman is the boobies. 
[00:17:00]  I don't know.  And when she was taken aback at some of your sexual advances, why'd you have to say this?  Well, we're waiting.  My God, Rick.  All right.  I don't know if Rachel's qualified for the job, Anthony.  Why?  I got a little audio of Rachel after, you know, Rick was through with it. 
[00:17:30]  I got sort of a kind of brain.  Did you hire her for her body?  Flaming Arrow checking and saying, please search Rick's apartment.  And Sheep Lover is saying that we shouldn't blame Rick because it was Max at the time.  It was Rick's alter ego, Mad Max.  Even a better callback.  You douchebag.  All right.  Liz, what's up?  I'm so hung up on these girls over here.  Oh, the teen fake-os? 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  On my way to work.  I fully missed my exit.  I have to go home and change my pants because I am dripping.  She went through a puddle, I guess, and the water came in through the window, Opie, and  now she's wet.  It's happened.  Yeah, nice stretch.  It happened.  And between the girls on the radio and me in tandem, it's like a stereo over here for  anyone who's interested in listening.  Wow.  So I just wanted to say thanks.  Oh, we do have other intern openings coming up. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, Liz, would you like to intern with the Open Anthony Show?  I don't know.  I love probing intern's openings.  I've heard the interviews are pretty tough.  I hope I can hack it.  Hell, let's be like Gary Condon and just wreck our careers.  Why not?  Let's just get hot interns.  We'll get nothing done.  Don't get too attached.  We'll make you disappear.  All right, Liz.  Thanks.  Bye.  By the way, someone needs to say it.  That girl is not hot.  Who, that?  The missing intern.  They call her the hot intern.  The New York Post always says the attractive young intern. 
[00:19:00]  Attractive young intern.  Well, the Post tags somebody with something and then just leaves it that way.  Like the other one, the girl, the flight attendant he was with, is the flame-haired stewardess.  Right.  And now she's just referred to as that.  The flame-haired stewardess.  She looks like Miranda from Sex and the City 20 years from now.  Ah.  Look at me with a little Sex and the City line.  I know.  There'll be 20 things going.  Sex and the City?  Fag.  Faggot.  All right, we got to take a break.  Yeah. 
[00:19:30]  Ladies and gentlemen, today is the day we do blind boxing.  Blind boxing, part of the cripple bouts.  Cripple bouts that we're doing here on the show.  This is the second bout.  Yesterday was one-legged boxing where the two guys were hopping around and beating the crap out of each other.  The great, great, great video clips on foundrymusic.com.  You know, we've had some really good clips on Foundry.  This could be one of the best clips ever.  The right hand that Woody lays in on, what the hell's his name? 
[00:20:00]  Jim.  Jim.  I have a mental block with his name.  With Jim is hysterical.  He just clocks him and you hear it and he goes down.  He goes down, man.  One-legged boxing.  I'm very surprised only a couple hundred people have downloaded the video clip.  Yeah.  Because it's really, really funny as they hop around and box.  Especially that first round.  Right.  It just levels them.  And we're getting a lot of complaints because we got some still shots on WNEW.com.  And we have like 15 shots of the same exact thing. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, they're not very good.  We got to get better with, you know, putting pictures up on websites.  Action shots.  Yeah, you only need three or four to tell that story.  How many people downloaded the video off of Foundry Music?  A couple hundred.  Just a couple hundred?  Tops.  And the rest of them, I guess, changed other people's phone service or just something because  it's very hard to find those video clips on Foundry Music.  Not only that.  Did you have to fill out a 20-page questionnaire before you could download them?  Not only that.  I don't think people are smart enough to download them, figure out where the files are downloading 
[00:21:00]  to.  The zip file.  Yeah, and how to open them up.  Do you think that's the problem?  I would bet money that's the problem.  People don't know how to unzip files?  I think you're right.  Yeah.  Who am I kidding?  You got to keep it very simple for the listeners.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  So that's happening.  Yes, blind boxing.  Both blind guys have been picked up in limos and they're on their way.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, we'll get into this.  We'll get...  Hold on.  We got to take a break before we get into that because that's really good. 
[00:21:30]  Also, uh, Arnold Shapiro?  Arnold Shapiro.  The executive producer of Big Brother 2.  He's calling in at 530.  Obviously, you know the story by now.  We kind of broke it to everyone yesterday.  Yeah.  Uh, Justin got kicked out of the house for putting a knife to Krista's throat.  Yes.  And see?  And let me tell CBS something right off the bat here.  You guys are a bunch of pussies if you don't show that clip on TV tonight.  What?  They're not going to show it?  Uh, they're kind of saying, uh, they're not really sure.  Why?  Because it'll glorify it or something? 
[00:22:00]  They're a bunch of pussies if they don't show the video clip.  And they're a bunch of pussies for kicking this guy out.  Yeah.  This is what you want in a show like Big Brother 2.  A freaking guy that's completely insane.  I would watch every single second.  Controversy.  It's great.  The guy's been taking leaks into, like, cameras and throwing stuff and putting knives to girls' throats.  He is, if you pull the tape of last year's Big Brother and listen to our suggestions of who we would have in the house to spice things up, he's everything we said. 
[00:22:30]  Right.  Didn't we have pee-in-the-corner guy?  Yeah.  And hold a knife to people's throat guy?  Yeah.  It makes it interesting.  They finally got someone like that in there and they're going to throw him out.  See, that's the problem with Big Brother.  Every time they get something a little bit on the controversial side, they squash it and get rid of it.  It's the politically correct atmosphere we live in today.  And it's ruining entertainment.  This guy stays in the house.  I'm watching every single show they put on TV and I'm signing up for that stupid 20 bucks or whatever it is to see it live on the Internet. 
[00:23:00]  Right.  I would watch every second.  20 bucks to get on the Internet and see what you saw last year for free.  Right.  But they're already getting rid of the controversy.  Bad move and we're going to tell Arnold Shapiro to his face today.  Okay.  Also, Anthony, I think when we get back, we were playing What's in My Pants last night.  Yeah.  It went horribly wrong.  I don't want to tell people what went wrong about it because there's a whole bunch of brand new people that probably didn't hear the bit last night. 
[00:23:30]  So I want them to kind of play along with us today.  Okay.  We're going to do that next.  It's a clip from yesterday's show where it went horribly wrong.  Right.  And we'll get into that next.  More of your phone calls, too.  877-692-1027.  And Anthony's show.  New York, Dallas, Chicago, Philly, Cleveland, Columbus, Sacramento, San Francisco.  The empire is spreading.  Conqueror, you bastards!  Anthony, New York sports clubs.  New York sports clubs, Opie. 
[00:24:00]  Some people haven't found their way to New York sports clubs.  And it's amazing.  New York sports clubs, the easiest gyms to get to.  They've got over 75 locations in the tri-state area.  This gym makes it so easy to get in shape.  New York sports clubs, they're near home, near work, near everywhere.  For one near you, call them up.  1-800-301-1231.  The best part, New York sports clubs offers the month-to-month membership.  You're not locked into a long-term financial commitment, unlike those other gyms.  At New York sports clubs, you decide how long you want to be a member.  I'm Anthony.  Yeah. 
[00:24:30]  I'm a member of New York sports clubs.  Yes, you are.  And I go like two or three times a week.  You'll find tons of exercise equipment in New York sports clubs.  And they've got classes like cycling, boxing, boot camp, yoga, pilates, cultural dance, and ultimate conditioning.  You never get bored.  You only get fit.  Call them up.  1-800-301-1231.  Stop by New York sports clubs.  They've got the special joining rates in effect.  You people are tools.  Joining rates in effect.  1-800-301-1231. 
[00:25:00]  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  There's something about this song I really like.  That's clutch.  Careful with that mic. 
[00:25:30]  Toll free, 877-692-1027.  Steven, what's going on?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Had to be the first to call in.  We got the first WOW sticker off the back of the bus today.  I knew this was going to happen.  Oh, it's great.  It's sticking on the back of a brand new white Dodge Dakota pickup.  The pickup is tricked out.  Yeah.  And the WOW sticker on the tailgate.  Plus, we got one on the back of my dump truck. 
[00:26:00]  We're doing construction today up in Harlem.  Right on, man.  So we got the flag guy.  I wouldn't let the bus go through until we pulled it off.  That's hilarious.  Man, congratulations, Steven.  It's great.  I got photos, guys.  I'll send them to you.  All right.  Yeah, please do.  We got to explain.  We have bus signs and stuff all over the city.  Yeah.  Now, on the back of the city buses, there's huge wows, just like the bumper sticker.  And in the subways, our WOW sticker is one of the hottest things in New York.  You can't go a block or two without seeing one of these WOW bumper stickers. 
[00:26:30]  Yep.  And the company decided to put billboards in and bus signs and subway signs.  And all they did was made the WOW bumper sticker just huge.  People are starting to steal them already.  Yeah.  They're on the backs of buses, which is hysterical because that's just like a group WOW thing.  Like, now, girls, you see the WOW on the back of a bus, you got to WOW the bus.  You got to WOW the bus.  That guy's taking them, though.  Oh, they do look really cool.  Yeah.  When they're that big.  Just a giant version of the sticker. 
[00:27:00]  Sure.  All right.  You want to play this What's in My Pants from yesterday?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't say what happened.  Oh, no.  It just went wrong.  I want to surprise some people today.  It just went wrong, that's all.  We always have new listeners, you know, tuning in and out of radio shows.  So we love to play What's in My Pants.  You know, we get girls on the phone and they rub the phone and we figure out what's going on in their pants.  You know the deal.  Type of hairstyle, yeah.  Sure.  I don't think we're ever going to play the game again. 
[00:27:30]  What?  No.  We have to.  I don't think we're going to play the game again.  Really?  Not after yesterday.  Hold on.  Woody just wants to say hi.  The one-legged boxer from yesterday.  Woody.  You.  Hey, buddy.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Hey, the clips of you boxing, Jimmy, unbelievable.  I got to get that stuff.  How are you guys doing today?  We're doing well, man.  All right.  So when am I going back in?  Well, you're the one-legged boxing champ.  We got to find someone that wants to take you on.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  I'm going to end up with a 350 dude just squashing me. 
[00:28:00]  I don't know about that.  Nah, I think you're a real contender, man.  Yeah, definitely.  Those pictures are nasty, buddy.  I'm what?  Uh, WNEW.com?  My stump looks like a big fish sticking out of his nose.  Yeah, I am.  A big fish.  It's pretty cool, though.  Now, Woody, you were hilarious.  You were the star of the show yesterday, so.  Thank you so much.  Hey, thanks.  And hi to Jimmy.  Yeah, right on.  He called in a little while ago.  Oh, cool.  We got all your info, right?  Yeah, I just wanted to, you know, say hi to the band, Day 19, and that's about it. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, that's right.  We forgot to give your band a plug.  His band, man.  Day19.net.  You're the drummer in the punk band, right?  I am the one-legged Wonderboy, yes.  Nice.  All right.  All right, guys.  Thank you so much.  All right, Woody.  Later.  Bye.  He'll be back to defend his one-legged title.  Right.  Okay, so, yeah, we were playing What's in My Pants yesterday.  Yeah.  And, um, it went horribly wrong.  It just went wrong, that's all.  So why don't we just, you know, hit the tape, okay?  All right.  By the way, real fast again, I know I'm jumping off the highway here a bunch of times, 
[00:29:00]  but a lot of people calling in.  They're asking about blind boxing.  It will happen today.  Right, Rick?  Yep.  Both blind guys have been picked up.  Both guys have been picked up and are on their way, courtesy of Anthony's Vital Transportation.  Oh, look at that.  Annoying laugh, Anthony.  Picked him up today.  Huh?  Annoying laugh, Anthony.  All right, we're going to have to give him a good plug today.  Oh, no.  Because this could be one of the best bits we ever do.  Yeah.  Can't fool around with that.  So that's why we're not doing blind boxing yet. 
[00:29:30]  We've got to get the guys here.  So you have time to call your friends and tell them what's happening on the Opie and Anthony show today.  Right.  This is a must hear today.  All right?  Right.  But here's What's In My Pants from yesterday.  Just a little bit of audio.  It went horribly, horribly wrong.  Jamie!  Yeah.  You know how long I've been waiting to try and play What's In My Pants?  What's In Your Pants?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Jamie?  Yeah.  You all right?  Yeah.  I'm playing with a finger puppet right now.  You're playing with a finger puppet?  Yeah. 
[00:30:00]  You don't know what that means, Anthony.  I'm not smart enough to figure that out.  You ever see a finger puppet?  It's a little puppet you put on your finger and you do a little puppet show.  Okay.  That must be.  Oh, okay.  I got the visual in my head now.  Yeah.  Jamie?  Are you an African princess?  Uh, half.  Half?  Yeah.  What's the other half?  What half?  Upper or lower?  Italian and African.  Mmm.  Nice.  Would you like to give us a fake orgasm? 
[00:30:30]  And I'm not half-picking it either.  Wow.  Look at that.  That rocks.  Do we play What's In My Pants with Jamie or we just continue?  A mid-bra bingo What's In My Pants game?  A diversion?  Sure.  Let's go.  Why not?  All right, Jamie, where are you? 
[00:31:00]  In your room?  Yeah.  What do you got on?  My boyfriend's boxers.  How old are you?  20.  And?  I'll be 21 soon.  Yeah?  In September.  All right.  And that's all you got on is his boxers?  Yeah.  Nice.  What kind of posters you got in your room?  Allen Iverson.  A what?  Allen Iverson.  Allen Iverson.  Uh-huh.  Nice.  All right.  Lay down on your bed.  I'm with you, Sarah.  Okay.  Hold on.  We've got to play the theme song. 
[00:31:30]  Let's do the theme.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my bag?  And I'll be having fun.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my bag?  Hello, cutie pie.  I'm assuming you don't have the boxers on anymore, Jamie?  I could get rid of that problem.  Yeah, that is a problem.  As you do that, Anthony will explain the rules of what's in my pants. 
[00:32:00]  Well, we will ask Jamie to take the telephone she is on and move it around, as per our instructions,  on a certain area, and judging just by the sounds coming out of that phone,  we will try to discern what hairstyle she is sporting.  Is it the natural triangular shape?  Is it the mohawk, which is, of course, the landing strip?  Is it the Hitler mustache, which is a mohawk that has been shaved down to just a little tuft of hair? 
[00:32:30]  Or is it the wood floor, also known as the JonBenet Ramsey?  Yeah, this could be challenging, because I'm sure she has the nappy hair.  Now, Jamie, remember, very important on your part, no clues, no hints as to what you're sporting down there  until we ask, um, she must be talking about the telephone.  Right.  Maybe we shouldn't mention anything about anything that's going on, okay? 
[00:33:00]  All right, Jamie?  Don't bring that up, because they might dump out of things like that.  Let's just play Guess What's in My Pants.  Jamie, if you would please take the phone and rub it in an up-and-down fashion.  Let's all listen.  20-year-old Jamie.  Wow.  Wow.  Okay, yeah, very telling, sure.  All right.  Side to side.  Side to side, Jamie.  Oh. 
[00:33:30]  Okay, um, circular motion.  Oh, circular motion.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Oh, right.  There was some static electricity there.  Ah.  Okay.  I think I know.  I think I know, too.  But, uh, can I hear the side to side one more time?  Slowly.  Slowly.  Slowly.  I got it.  Very telling.  Anthony, I'm saying wood floor. 
[00:34:00]  I'm going with complete wood floor.  I'm, I'm, uh...  John Benet Ramsey, whatever you want to call it.  I'm, uh, I'm, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.  Oh, man.  Um, darn it.  I'm going to go triangle.  All right.  Ben?  Ben, what did you hear there?  No poop.  You're passing.  I'm too stupefied by what's going on today.  Rick?  Can I just hear up and down one more time?  Oh, I didn't really hear that. 
[00:34:30]  I'm going to go with Hitler Mustang.  All right.  All right.  Well, the guesses are in.  We've all heard it.  You played along at home.  Jamie, if you would tell us, please, what is in your pants?  You ready, Fred?  What is?  A big seat.  A big seat.  Oh, no. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, wow.  Wow.  All right.  That is funny.  I thought Jamie or whoever that was was up to some,  because the voice sounded too, you know, hot.  I think I could get one of those voice things.  Is that funny?  If we weren't so distracted, we may have been able to pick up on that,  but that's pretty good. 
[00:35:30]  Holy smoke.  Will's calling back.  Hey, Will.  What's up?  You suck.  Was that you the whole time?  Yeah.  I had to get you guys once.  Wait.  Do the voice again.  Yeah.  I'm laughing right now.  Yeah.  This is Jamie.  How are you?  I had to get the famous movie and Anthony just once.  Son of a bitch.  Because part of me is, like, hoping that there really was a girl there,  and then at the last second, you know, she gave the phone to her boyfriend. 
[00:36:00]  No, it was me.  I used it to try and get bisexual women on the phone line.  How much do you just screw with people with that voice?  A lot.  I messed with my mom at work once, too.  That's good, man.  You got it.  All right, guys.  Why weren't you laughing, though?  Why?  I was able to bite down.  I was laughing, but I pulled the phone away.  He sucked so bad.  I don't even want to ask him what he was rubbing the phone on.  Yeah.  What were you doing? 
[00:36:30]  No, it was just my chest hair.  That was all.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  How gay do you guys feel?  All right, Bill, you suck.  You too.  Wait, later.  You're the African princess.  Well, yeah.  Leave us with a little something.  What's that?  In that voice.  Go ahead.  Yeah, this is Jamie, and I love Opium Anthony.  Ah!  Ah!  You suck.  All right.  No, you guys suck.  Take it easy. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, we got it.  Yeah.  And there you have it from yesterday.  Ben's the only one that didn't want to play for some reason.  Ben was, like, not into it last night.  But I'm getting accused saying I knew.  I had no idea.  I don't know.  That retard that was standing outside with his mouth hanging open with his tongue out  was making me laugh.  I wasn't even paying attention.  I was laughing at him.  Ah!  And just was, I don't know.  I had no clue, though.  The crying game.  Ugh. 
[00:37:30]  Uncle John wants in on this one.  Uncle John.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  You have to listen to that bit again.  You have to add a fifth category to it now.  Yeah.  After the mohawk, you've got to have the whole Indian.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  See you, guys.  All right, Uncle John.  Oh, that sucked yesterday.  Got us.  What can we say?  Uh, Blind Dave and Blind Matt were in a limo, and they called, but they hung up.  If they're listening to us, please call back.  We want to know where you are.  I hope, uh, Annoying Laugh Anthony isn't driving.  They're blind. 
[00:38:00]  I don't think they know where they are.  Yeah, but where are you?  I don't know.  In the car.  I don't know.  That'd be fun to ask them, though, Rick.  But when you're blind, and you know how the other senses really become acute?  Uh, their sense of hearing, if they have to sit there and listen to Annoying Laugh Anthony,  it's going to be ten times worse for a blind guy than it is for us, because they depend  on their ears.  And if you just hear that, ee, ee, aah, aah.  Well, they're on their way.  When they get here, we'll get right into blind boxing, right, Anthony? 
[00:38:30]  Oh, yeah.  All right.  That gag  Alright, we can do that next  We have some time before blind boxing  Yeah, one of our own is just  Dicking us over really bad  I don't understand  What possesses  Psycho Mark to do this  I mean  He's been a friend of the show  He used to work here  And now we find out 
[00:39:00]  He's suing  The radio station  I gotta say  This is not a bit  This isn't a gag  Psycho Mark is suing  The radio station  He wants money  For all the bits that he appeared on  For all the bits that he's been on  Regardless of if he was involved  Like something like Sex for Sam  He was out and about  He was a huge part of that bit  Right  But there are other bits 
[00:39:30]  He sent a list  Yeah  Can we go over the list  After we get back from break  Yeah, we can do that  Some of these bits  Completely ridiculous  That he's trying to say  He was a part of  Yeah  Completely  I don't know what he's thinking  Blind Dave is checking in  Blind Dave  Hey, how you doing guys?  Alright  Listen, I don't think  That was a limo  What?  That's not the right Dave  Oh, alright  Oh, jack off  I should have known  Blind Dave  It's funny  Okay  We'll be back 
[00:40:00]  This is the FU line  877-692-1027  God, every day  You can never get this right  Every day  Never get this right  It's not B  It's A  A, B, C, and D  There's something for what do we learn  Later on the show  It's not B  It's A  Let's go to the FU line  Yeah, I'd like to give a big fat  FU to my girlfriend's boss  Who fired her yesterday  Because she wouldn't get down 
[00:40:30]  And suck his  Next message  Hey, this is Debra Dyke  And I have a big FU  For the fat, red-headed  Tea-sucking  Father-fucking bag  That rear-ended me  Every red-headed baby  Should be killed at birth  And this way  This ass wouldn't have rear-ended me  Next message  Goddamn  I hate my job  I hate my boss  I hate my wife  I hate my life  I'm going to kill myself  Next message 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, this FU goes out to this bitch  I just met on a cruise last week  She's a newer listener from Chicago  That's F-ing CT's name, Honda  Well, I was buying her drinks all week last week  Only to find out that she hooked up at the end of the week  With this F-ing tool  Well, go F yourself, you F-ing twat  I hope you caught crabs on that tool  And you can't get rid of them for a year  Go F yourself  End of message  Anthony Bud Light  Who doesn't love Bud Light?  I don't know of one person  It's great  It's a light beer  But it doesn't taste like a light beer  If you're going to be hanging out at the beach 
[00:41:30]  Or the ballpark  All summer long  Bud Light is the perfect companion, isn't it?  What beer does West Coast Dave like today?  West Coast Dave loves Bud Light  Very nice  It's not like whenever I do a Bud Light spot  He sends instant feedbacks that say  Tool  I don't know  I think that means  Tool me open on icy cold Bud Light  He loves it  I don't know what they're doing out there in San Francisco  Where West Coast Dave is from  But they're enjoying Bud Light  Right  Bud Light 
[00:42:00]  The biggest thing about it  It tastes just like regular Bud  I go to parties  You see Bud Light in the cooler there  With the rest of the beers  I have no problem picking up a Bud Light  Because I know it's not going to taste watered down  And as I say, yucky  That's right  Bud Light  So for the real taste  That won't fill you up  And never lets you down  That's their little slogan, Opie  Make it a Bud Light  This is the Opie and Anthony show 
[00:42:30]  It's not like Billy needs a tissue all the time  Take me away  And we kid because we love  We're friends with those guys  Of course, they haven't been on our show here in New York yet  Damn it 
[00:43:00]  Big hi to everyone that's going to see Stained this afternoon  A lot of Opie and Anthony fans going to check out a pre-acoustic set with Stained this afternoon on Long Island  877-692-1027  What?  What happened?  Hey, hey  What?  That old gag  What happened?  What?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha  The blind guy is just minutes away from the studio  Blind boxing on the Opie and Anthony show 
[00:43:30]  You still have time to tell your friends  Give them a call and tell them what we're doing on the show today, okay?  Blind boxing  Blind boxing, yes  With blind Dave and blind Matt, I believe  Part of the cripple bouts, um, extravaganza we're throwing here on the Opie and Anthony show  Correct  Looking for anyone with any kind of, uh, physical problem  That might, in the old days, have deemed you a cripple  Now in this politically correct world, they're called, um, handy, uh, not even handicapped  They're handy-capable 
[00:44:00]  Handy-capable, right  That's right  And, uh, we just want you to come down and we'll put you in different, um, uh, little, uh, activities with each other  Well, we're going to have wheelchair jousting  We're, we're working on that one  That one, I'm so psyched for  Because they get to choose weapons  And like the old knights  They will have lances and maybe even spin some maces over their heads  And flap each other in the face  Our ultimate goal?  What?  Flipper fighting  Flipper fighting  If there's any, um, thalidomide babies out there 
[00:44:30]  Remember the people that took the, the, the pregnant women took the thalidomide  And they had the kids with the little flipper arms  Or the little underdeveloped, like a finger growing out of your shoulder  Now that would be a brawl to watch  No, you know what we should do?  Yeah, flipper darts  Flipper darts  What, they got to shoot darts?  Yeah, you know Lobster Boy?  Yeah, with the, uh, hands  Hands that look like lobster claws?  Yeah  If you have that going on, we'll, we'll have a dart, uh, a dart tournament  I don't think so, though  You know something?  I don't think that works  Because they can usually do things like that 
[00:45:00]  Eh  Like people with the, uh, the  You're trying to tell me the people that have a hand growing out of their shoulder can throw a dart nicely?  You see specials, they're tying shoes, they're, they're cooking, they're doing things  You gotta get something they've never done, like boxing  How the hell are you gonna box?  How are you gonna find boxing gloves that fit the flippers?  See?  You just tie them to their shoulders  Alright, as we wait for the blind guys  Yeah  For blind boxing, which is gonna be great today  We got the little bells and stuff, so they know where each other is  We got, uh, we got them cat bells, so they can kinda hear where the other opponent is 
[00:45:30]  And, uh, we got them headgear, the mouthpieces, everything, they're all set  Right on  Alright  In the meantime, uh, very, very, very disappointed today  In, uh, one of the members of the Opie and Anthony family  Psycho Mark  Never thought I'd say it, but, uh, Psycho Mark just being a complete douchebag  Mm-hmm  You wanna explain Psycho Mark, uh, Psycho Mark to some of the new cities?  Well, Psycho Mark, uh, joined us, uh, a while back 
[00:46:00]  As the, um, resident lunatic of this show  I think the first thing he did for us, we had that Michael Hebranko guy  Remember him?  Yeah, one of these guys, they had to get out of his house with a forklift because he was so fat  One of those big fat guys, they gotta plow the side of your house down and pull you out with a forklift because you weigh, uh, like 900 pounds  So they brought him to a hospital and Richard Simmons was involved and everything  And we had Psycho Mark go to the hospital, dressed as a doctor so he could get in  And deliver a huge, uh, bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken 
[00:46:30]  Well, we figured the guy was hungry  He had to be hungry  You know, you can't just go from laying in your bed and having to be cut out of your house to a liquid diet in a hospital  What's a chicken leg gonna hurt?  We were just being enablers  And Psycho Mark helped us out there  And we found out he'd pretty much do anything  Lunatic, he doesn't care what he says to anybody  Nothing  Have that one, Reeb  So how did Psycho Mark get fired?  New York, bear with us  Yeah, uh, well, we had something called  Everyone in New York knows  Yeah, we had something called Sex for Sam 
[00:47:00]  It was a Sam Adams contest where we wanted to send a listener, uh, with a guest up to, uh, Boston  Where we were gonna broadcast live  By the way, yeah, Sex for Sam 2  Coming up, coming soon  Very good  Psycho Mark, uh, was one of the spotters  We had a bunch of couples, uh, they were given a list of, uh, landmarks around Manhattan  Around New York City  And they had to have sex  At these, uh, locations for points  And we had spotters to make sure they were actually having sex  Because we didn't want them lying  So we sent Stinky out with one couple 
[00:47:30]  Sent Psycho Mark out with another couple  Rick and Ben  Rick and Ben with a couple more couples  Ben's couple didn't have any sex that day  No  The guy couldn't get it going on  And then there was  Ben ended up in the Hard Rock Cafe  Just getting drunk with his couple  Yeah  It was the saddest moment in the Sex for Sam Olympics there  The, uh, the, uh, the Hard Rock was one of the locations that people had to have sex in  Yeah  Uh, so Psycho Mark, um, was doing very well with his team  And we gotta, uh, state the two-point conversion  Was extra two points if they had sex  And it was backdoor action 
[00:48:00]  So, so he was taking him around  He's doing very well  And then we said, look  Ten points  Twenty-five points  Something, something  Some ridiculous amount of points  If, uh, you got your couple to have sex on Ken Stevens' couch  The leather couch  The GM of this station  His leather couch in his office  He, he has a class office  So you can see  And no problem  Psycho Mark, uh, 
[00:48:30]  Brings his couple upstairs  Uh, gets into the boss's office  He's on the cell phone  Live on our show  And tells them  Go ahead  Do the two-point conversion  On the couch  It'll be something like 27 points  Instant win  Uh, so the couple proceeds to start  Uh, getting ready to do this action on the boss's, uh, couch  And our, uh, PD, Jeremy  Starts looking in and going  No, you cannot do this  Psycho Mark's on the phone with us 
[00:49:00]  He looks at Jeremy  Looks at the couple  He goes  Go ahead, do it  And he goes  What the F  Go for it  Blatant disregard for Superior's order  And he was fired  Fired  He's still been  And we fought for him  Because he's a great addition to the show  He's a lunatic  Uh, he's been on  Uh, afterwards  Um, with phone calls  And stopping by to say hi  And, you know, doing stuff on the air  With a bunch of other people here in the studio  Having fun  Hanging out  He's a funny guy  Well now 
[00:49:30]  We find out  He's suing the station  This is, uh, this is, uh, you know  Uh, he's been calling us trying to get his job back  And we want to get him back, you know, involved with the show  Right  And he's  He called me only  A week and a half ago  And poured his guts out to me  Yeah  This is not  The way you try to get back on a radio show  I know  By pissing off our superiors  So he's suing the  The company  Mm-hmm  Suing, uh, the company 
[00:50:00]  And, uh, he has sent over  Or his lawyer  Who sent this?  I think his lawyer  His lawyer  They're in the, the, uh, discovery portion  So they're looking for, uh, I guess  Evidence of bits and stuff like that  He sent over a list  Of bits  That he says he was involved in  And, now, what  Does he want money for each bit? 
[00:50:30]  Is there  I don't know what this lawsuit is  According to the way it was phrased to us  From Jeremy  These are a list of bits  That Mark starred in  Started  He is a principal  It wasn't the Opie and Anthony show  It was the Opie and Anthony and Psycho Mark show  On these bits  Alright, these are the bits he starred in, Anthony  Right  Alright  Um  Man  It's pathetic how much money he's fighting for, too  It's not like he's fighting for, like, a hundred grand or something crazy  Wouldn't the legal fees outweigh what he's asking for?  Uh, but yeah 
[00:51:00]  Pretty close  I, I, I, I don't, I don't understand  With the money  If he won his case  He would be able to go on a good vacation  Let's just put it that way  That's about it  I don't understand why he's doing this  And for that he's sacrificing the chance to get back on the show  Yeah, I  Eh  That's his life, though  And there's fringe benefits that he gets from the show, which are great  We should charge him for every listener he banked  Yeah  My horse  I mean, I just don't get it  A thousand bucks for every listener he banked  Bucks a pop  That's about a hundred grand he owes us 
[00:51:30]  Three from Saturday  What are the bits that he's looking to, um, collect on?  The 50 gallon drum challenge  It's a 55 gallon drum  55 gallon drum challenge  Yeah  It had nothing to do with that  What, what did he do for that?  Well, there's little side notes next to each one that I guess  Who wrote these?  Those are, that's Jeremy's  Jeremy wrote  I guess, uh, you listened to some of it  Or got, uh, uh  Yeah  People that told him what he did 
[00:52:00]  And, and he wrote down  In what capacity Mark contributed to these bits  55 gallon drum  Laugh in background  That's what's written here  He wants to get paid for laughing in the background  Of one of those bits  Laugh in background  Jay Moore fight  Which one was that?  Jay Moore and, uh, Billy and Paul  All right, the air sick  April Fool's gag that they pulled on us  Right  I don't see anything there  I don't even remember him being in the studio that day  St. Paddy's Day  What's that side note? 
[00:52:30]  Oh, that's when he did, um, uh  We got some audio  That one he did  That was, um, do we have that clip?  Now that was out  I don't think we can play it  That was  We can't play any of his stuff now?  Because then, then they'll put down a new date  And say the time that it was played  Yeah  Well, this will probably be on there now  Because we were just talking about it  What a  It's like a paradox  What a douchebag  What's he doing?  But we can't even play that bit now?  I like Mark very much  I really do 
[00:53:00]  He's a fun guy  We all like him  But he's being really stupid  I don't know why he's doing this  Basically it's outtakes of him  Really, really drunk  Now this also was part of his job  He was the production guy here  So his job was to go in  And, uh, voice some of these  Public service announcements  And commercials  And if we took outtakes from that  It's just part of, you know  His job was to record that stuff  And if we want to take the outtakes  And play them on the show  It seems like, you know 
[00:53:30]  You're a member of the team  I mean  Hot Wax Girl  That's where, uh, Jill  I believe her name  Yep, Jill  With a really nice body  She came in  Got completely naked  And we were just dripping  Hot Wax on her  She  Mark wasn't dripping  Wax on her  No, he didn't do anything  Spaz Tomato  Wasn't even working here  It's written next to that  So there's a bit on here  Before Mark even started  Working with us  And Spaz is an old employee  That had sex with the tomato 
[00:54:00]  Mark had nothing to do  With that  Laverne and Shirley tirade  He dropped by  That day  And just started like  Really, uh, bashing  Uh, retarded Laverne and Shirley  But we had a bunch of people in here  Bashing retarded Laverne and Shirley  Not only that  He was not employed here at that time  And it's not like you come in  Punch a clock  Go, you know, to work  Punch out and leave  He was here because  If you thought for a second  That he was going to demand money  For contributing 
[00:54:30]  In that sense  Would we even have had him in here  No, we didn't need him for the bit  It's not like, you know  We have him in because it's fun  And he's hanging out  Just like anyone else  That wants to come in and hang out  So I don't understand  Where that comes from  Without boring people  Because the list goes on and on  Yeah  You should just, uh, just  Throw out a couple more  Of the highlights  Like Earl hanging pictures  Earl hanging pictures  Black Earl  We asked him to hang like six pictures  Yeah  And it took him all day 
[00:55:00]  Right  It was a bit that  Was Ant and I and Earl  I don't get it  I think he might have ran down the hall  To see how Earl was doing  And gave us a report  That's about it  If I remember correctly on that  Um, Anthony's commercial screw up  My outtakes  What's that?  I think because you hear him laughing  In the background  More laughter in the background  It just goes on and on  How about the Earl driving? 
[00:55:30]  There is no Earl driving thing  We don't even know what bit that is?  No!  We're always goofing on Earl  About his driving  And now, you know  That's why you haven't heard  Any of the sound clips  You know, cancel  Oh, I can't say it  Because I've heard that  Even if we impersonate his place  Are you serious?  I don't know  The whole story about  Drunk German Ed  Right  Kicking a black man out  On the street  At two in the morning  Because we came back  Really hammered  From a bachelor party  That's a great story 
[00:56:00]  He was part of that  It was like a 20 minute story  He was in it  For like two minutes  Is it true that  Psycho Mark's lawyer  Is going to use  The Chewbacca defense?  So that's  Kind of sad  It really is  It's a dick move  It's more sad than anything  Because it's not like  He's fighting over  A lot of money  You know  And it's no  We still have to talk  Jeremy and Ken  Into rehiring him 
[00:56:30]  This certainly  Is not going to help  Because now Jeremy and Ken  Are completely pissed off  Now they really don't like him  No, they don't  I know  Mark, good luck  With your lawsuit  Yeah, you know  Good luck getting laid  Without this show  I hope it works for you  No, really  You could get laid  Without this show, Mark  I'm sure you can  Well  Doesn't even have  The balls to call us  Where is he?  I don't know  Are we going to have to pay him 
[00:57:00]  If we put his phone call  On the air today?  That I think too  Yes  Yes  He was having a great time  At the road show this Saturday  Yeah  With all this pending  Banging another listener  Everyone wants to be paid now  That's all I'm saying  Is everyone wants to be paid now  Look, Brett on line 10  I've been on O&A twice  Pay me now  Another guy wants a dollar  For every time  His instant feedback was read  And he says  He says he was on 
[00:57:30]  16,000 times  16,000 times?  Yes  He's been keeping track at home  He thinks it's fair  A dollar per instant feedback  That we read  You know what?  From now on  It's all Ant and I  Right  When those great  Instant feedback lines come in  See, now we're not going to be able  To give you credit  It's all me  For it  It's all me, me, me, me, me  Now we can't  Psycho Martling  Great  No, I came up with that 
[00:58:00]  See, Big Chris really did  But I can't give him the credit  See, he's going to want a dollar now  Psycho Martling  Hey, Big Chris  Yeah, how you doing, guys?  I just used your line  That's okay  Psycho Jackie Martling  How much money do I owe you?  Like five bucks?  Eh, we'll call it even this time  I'm a friend of the show  Yeah?  All right, thank you  Bye  See, friend of the show  Psycho Martling  Have fun collecting your 5,000 bucks  I hope it's worth it  Douche  Are the blind guys here? 
[00:58:30]  Yeah  Great  Hey, we got a little bit we can play  Going into a break  Because this was kind of a boring bit  For most people  Just had to let people know  What was going on, though  No, I know  It's, you know  It's a lot of people ask  It's show info  Which we do from time to time  877-692-1027  When we get back, Anthony  We're going to talk to the blind guys  They're here, right?  Yeah  Great  Very cool  We just got to get them from upstairs  It's blind Dave and blind Matt 
[00:59:00]  Rick, what are you doing?  I'm stunned by that whole thing  What do you, uh  What do you got?  A little Valby?  Yeah, we could do some John Valby  Sure  Much better with the beeps  Yeah  Mm-hmm  We'll be back with the blind guys  To set up blind boxing  Today on the Opie and Anthony show  John Valby  I could mess  For hours  On flowers 
[00:59:30]  Beat it on a rock  It could watch me  While I'm shaving  At the girls  It would be waving  If I only had a junk  It would jump  Just like a froggy  Make my blue jeans soggy  Unless I wore a jock  And I swear  I'd never eat her  I would always use my Peter  If I only had a junk  Ha, a junk 
[01:00:00]  Picture this  Our legs apart  The fragrance of  A tootie part  We'd bang  Right on the floor  Then up it pop  For more  I would air it out on Sundays  I'd even change my undies  Get round the clock  And I would always use a rubber  Whenever I F your mutter 
[01:00:30]  If I only had a  John  Junk  Doesn't quite fit the rank  Right  Well  W&EW is  The Sport Guys  At 5am  The Radio Chick  At 9  Ron and Fez  At noon  Opie and Anthony  At 3  John and Mike  At 7  Next time  On a very special  Ron and Fez  Vandalism strikes the show  Ronnie  Someone painted horrible graffiti  About me  All over the bathroom wall 
[01:01:00]  Uh, that's awful  Fez  Any idea you did it?  No, but I'll find out  I'm making a sign  Asking for any information  Get a pen  Uh, no I don't  Never mind  I'll just use this spray paint  I found on your desk  If only I could find a clue  All on the next  Ron and Fez  Ron and Fez  Middays  Noon to 3  1027  WNEW  Opie  And Anthony  1027  WNEW  Hey, you're checking out O&A 
[01:01:30]  Opie and Anthony  877-692-1027  The blind guys are here, Anthony  Yes  I think you're having second doubts, aren't you?  No, I was  You know, they're nice guys  And the one guy  Who is it?  It's Blind Dave  And Blind Matt  And Blind Matt  Blind Matt's got a dog  Blind Matt has a dog  He's got the CNI dog  We've already told him  He can't use the dog  In the boxing match 
[01:02:00]  That'd be great  All of a sudden  He goes for the legs  But we're gonna have to hide the dog  Because if Dave starts, you know  Punching Matt  I know  The dog may get pissed off  And want to jump in  We got problems here today  What the hell are we gonna do?  We gotta say hi to Bill Dwyer real fast  Hey, Bill  Hey  It's Opie and Anthony  We got you live  What's going on, man?  You guys are the greatest  Listen, you gotta put the dog somewhere else  Because he's gonna go ape  Yeah, I know  Yeah, I think you're right 
[01:02:30]  Are there no rules anymore to blind boxing?  Are there no more sanctions to blind boxing?  Of course, you're talking to one of the announcers of BattleBots  Yes  We have our own little thing that we like to call crippled bouts, Bill  I know  I heard about it  Oh, man  I can't wait to check out the one-legged boxers  One-legged boxing happened yesterday  The clip we have on our website is hilarious  Hilarious  The one guy just got killed  Got killed 
[01:03:00]  Bill?  We had a three-legged dog when I was a kid  And we'd make him sit  And then we'd try and make him give us his paw  Oh, that is cruel  That is cruel  Oh, yeah, I'm cruel  And you guys are introducing the contestants as Blind Matt and Blind Dave  Well, they're blind, and that's their name  Well, yeah  They're really blind, and they both have great senses of humor, man  Hey, Bill  It's not like we're letting poor defenseless machines go in the middle of an arena to bash each other 
[01:03:30]  So don't be a hypocrite  Hey, we're copying BattleBots  We have, like, obstacles in the ring and everything for the blind guys  What do I care?  We have a hacksaw that just pops up in the middle of our boxing ring  Man, are the blind guys going to be surprised when that happens  That's why you've got to lay the titanium over your sack  One of the things we've got going is very reminiscent of BattleBots  We're going to get two guys, each in wheelchairs  And we're going to give them various weapons they can choose from  Like the mace or the lance or a big hammer 
[01:04:00]  And we're going to let them go at it in our arena  And it'll look like BattleBots, I think  Yeah, well, it's called wheelchair jousting  Yeah  Why are you guys in radio?  Why not pay-per-view?  Oh, I know  That's what I say  Pay-per-view's on the way, my friend  I miss you guys, by the way  Yeah, when are you going to be in New York?  I don't know  Soon?  Get back here  We had fun last time you were in  Yeah  Yeah, I had a ball  This is the day you should be here  Blind boxing, come on  Tell me about it  Are they going to wear like special beeping things on their heads? 
[01:04:30]  They've got little bells  Cat bells  Really?  Cat bells  Cat bells  Yeah  So when they jingle, they'll know where to go  16-ounce gloves?  They're pretty heavy gloves, sure  Yeah, it's real  16-ounce gloves, okay  No one will get hurt too badly  It's real boxing equipment  I'm truly excited  Hey, should we bring the blind guys in while we have Bill on the line?  Sure  Maybe you want us to ask a question  I'll make sure I don't say, have you guys ever seen BattleBots?  You know, I'll try not to make that awkward moment  Well, the one guy said to the other the other day 
[01:05:00]  He goes, I'm going to run circles around you  And the other guy goes, we'll see  We'll see  No, no, no  You won't  You'll feel the wind  But the one-legged boxing yesterday, classic  Because the one guy was in really good shape  I wouldn't mess with him  Yeah  I'm not even kidding  He works out all the time  And when he was hopping on his one leg  It was very, very nice and very controlled  Up and down, short strokes, right?  Yeah  The other guy, when he was hopping  He would hop like three feet to the right  Four feet back to the left 
[01:05:30]  Side to side  He's going in with two hands  Trying to punch  It was really bad  How long did he last?  Seconds  Seconds  Oh, man  And then just got knocked right the F out  All right, we're sitting Blind Dave and Blind Matt, right?  There they go  Look at the dog  Hey, Blind Dave, what's up?  What's up, man?  Hey, someone's got to put the mic in front of his face  He doesn't know  All right, you got it  There you go  All right, I got it  All right, we have Bill Dwyer from BattleBots on the line  Hey, Matt and Dave  Have you guys ever  Oh, never mind  You ever listen to BattleBots?  No, but I heard him on your show 
[01:06:00]  He's real funny  Yeah, he's a good guy  There's no reason to listen to BattleBots, I would assume  Why?  Maybe there  I don't know  Sure there is  Oh, Opie  Yeah, are you going to make fun of me?  He's going to make fun of me  Here we go  No, there's  The guy has a dog with him and I believe him  But remember my test?  What's your test?  Crinkle, crinkle  When I was here last time  Crinkle, crinkle  Oh, right, right, right  Throwing the paper  Throwing the  I want equal testing  Oh, you want to make sure 
[01:06:30]  Oh, all right, I know what he's saying  I know what he's saying  If you throw something at me, precious  It'll be you and me with the gloves on  I think we could assume he's blind  I don't think  You know, who's going to go the distance  And get the dog and everything  What Dave is saying  Dogs are cheap  What Dave is saying  Last time we had Dave in here  We didn't really believe that he was blind  So we threw a piece of paper  To see if he would react to it  And he wants us to do that to Matt  Because he wants to make sure  He's fighting a true blind guy  Oh  But I'd say he's blind 
[01:07:00]  Can you see anything, Matt?  No, I can't  I have two prosthetic eyes  It's completely  Those are fake eyes?  They are  Wow  No  Can you take them out?  Bless the artist  I could  Well, let's not  No, I cannot  Deal with that  Do it!  Do it!  Do it!  Do it!  I'm not looking  Do it!  Wait, I'm sure a bunch of people have told you  Those are really good eyes  Yeah, they're not bad  And if I wasn't listening through headphones  I'd probably look right at you  When we were talking 
[01:07:30]  But  Really?  It's deceiving  It sounds like you're in my head  Oh, Jesus  And you could  Oh, yeah  Because the blind guys have the super ears  Hey, there's no chance an eye is going to pop out  If Dave punches you  No, I certainly hope not  I mean, I can  Oh, my God  Wait, can you pop one of the eyes out?  No, Pete!  Is it hard to do?  Holy ass  Holy ass!  Oh, my God  No, no  Yeah, he just did it  Oh, that is great 
[01:08:00]  Here's the live camera  Holy ass!  Oh, Pete, you suck, man  No, I wanted it, too, man  I want to know  How easy was that?  Let me tell you something, Dave  I can tell you for sure  That this guy is blind  Okay  Well, that's why, though  I don't know that the other one might see good  Oh, my God  I've never seen anything like that before  What are you  Oh!  I know it sucks  That rocks  That's a good party trick  Oh, it used to be a great party trick  You're invited to my next party  Because look at him  The eyes look completely like he has normal eyes 
[01:08:30]  When he stares in your direction  It looks like he's got  You know, he's looking at you  And he can pop it out  Hey, invite me to the next Opie party  I'll be there with eyes out  The road show?  I'm feeling beaten here  Let me tell you something  If we bring him to the next road show  In front of 3,800 people  He does that trick  Oh, my God  You think we get a reaction  When Big Butt Mendy shows her butt?  Matt, that's...  Wow!  What do you guys think?  Did he pop out both eyes?  Do you ever sneeze and have him just fly out?  Just one  But the other one works as well  Comes out also 
[01:09:00]  Sweet  I was talking to a friend the other day  And they were like  What color eyes would you want if you could have them?  I said, any color I want  All I've got to do is go to the artist  And tell them what color I want  Yeah, you could put in some wacky vampire eyes  Yeah, pink all and broad bone  Yeah  Yeah, absolutely  Hey, when you're hungover  Do you pop him a bloodshot once?  That's awesome  You know?  A little realism, right?  You've got to watch out  Gay Marco might get horny here  Matt, how long have you been blind?  Since I'm 5, I'm 31  Wow  No, Gay Marco, I will not leave an eye out for you  That's probably the only place he hasn't violated on some guy 
[01:09:30]  Jesus  Oh, Blind Steve  Even though I talked to you on the phone  And you sound like a nice guy  You're still a puss  Because you're not here  Even though it's your friend  Oh, Steve  They're talking to you, baby  Yeah, Blind  You still talked a lot of crap  But it's two days later  You couldn't make it two days ago  And you couldn't make it today  You're a puss  Wow  Yeah, Blind Dave really wanted to fight Blind Steve  But he's got Blind Matt  His eyes pop out  Because I'm not mad at this guy  Hey, guys  Since I'm not there 
[01:10:00]  How does this match look  Between the two blind guys?  Do they look pretty evenly matched?  Yeah, they're about the same height  I'd say  I'd say this is pretty even  How tall are you?  About 6'1  And Matt?  5'9 1⁄2  Oh, he's got the height advantage  He's got the weight, too  I'm about 170  Oh, you guys discussed all this on the way?  No, but I heard  Steven was telling me the other day  That Dave is 6'1 and about 200 or something  Yeah  And how was the limo ride?  Oh, I've got to thank Caro  Caro from Vital Transportation 
[01:10:30]  No, top-nudge limo there  I know Opie's beeping it out  You know what?  No, but that guy  They sent their best limo for you guys  It was a van  It wasn't a limo  You could tell  Even the blind guy could tell  No, but it was really  This is something we make fun of all the time  Even the blind guy knew that he was in a bus  And not a limo  It was really cool  It was really like a luxury ride  The guy was really cool to us 
[01:11:00]  And I tried to slip the guy a few bucks even  And he would not take it  And he let us smoke  And no one lets you do that  He was there at like quarter to one  And I get a thing from Rick saying  Instead of 2 o'clock  It might be more around 1.30  It's like quarter to one  There's a car outside  Someone, you know, beeping  I gotta ask Steve  Steve, did you get a video of Blind Matt?  Yeah, I did  I caught the tail end of it  If you wouldn't mind 
[01:11:30]  Can you pop the other one out?  We would put it on the website  You would be the star  Okay  Hold on  This is the other eye  Dave, to prove that this guy's completely blind  Yeah, because I know  Send it to the satellite right now, gentlemen  I am not looking  I need to see this  For all I know, I could be getting set up  They could just be  Hoping, could be hamming it up  No, no, I don't know  People want to  I'm guessing with a dog  See, he's banging the eyeball on the mic for you 
[01:12:00]  Oh, God  Don't scratch it up  Who was talking in this mic last?  Oh, my goodness  Oh, my God  That is unbelievable  I will wear that blindfold  And, Anthony, take a look through it  And see if you can see anything  Oh, no  This gets completely blacked out  I have a little, little bit of sight  But just to make it even  I will wear that blindfolded  Yeah, Matt  You know about that  Dave  Yeah, he has some  Can you see our faces right now?  No, not at all  What do you see right now?  Shadows  He's lights and shadows 
[01:12:30]  How about that?  Everything looks black to here  I see a light over here  If I look this way  I see that there's a light  Right somewhere  Oh, so you're just seeing  Like little spots of light  And I see  So what's the game plan?  To put me with a lit up lamp  Or something on my head?  Put a light on your head  That's it?  You just see little pieces of light?  No, I see light and dark  But, like  My right eye  Saw little fragments and stuff  But that's kind of gone  But my left eye  I could see Anthony's hand 
[01:13:00]  Oh, really?  On the mic?  No, right here  Oh, on the table?  On your leg?  Yeah  You could be spanking it  For all I know  These guys are  No, no  I'm not  Wow  I just need to ask the listener something  If we put a still shot  Of blind Matt popping his eye out  Yeah  Would you check it out  On WNEW.com?  I think they'd check it out  That's when my eyes go  That's what I want, man  When my eyes are completely gone  I want them out of my head  So I can do that  Because that's a talent, man 
[01:13:30]  I've got to ask a really stupid question, Dave  Is there any hope for you?  I mean, because I'm sure you're up on the research  There is hope  And there is actually a number that I don't have with me for  I mean, RP is a horrible, slow, torture disease  Where you lose your sight little by little  And I didn't bring the number  Because, to be frank  To be truthful  If I didn't have it  I wouldn't give a rat's ass  Oh, wow 
[01:14:00]  That's honest  It's like  Do you think Christopher Reeves gave a rat's ass  About quadriplegics before he became one?  No  No  So for me to sit here and go  Give to the blind people  I'm trying to help them  It would be a bunch of BS  I would be wanting to help me  Cool, man  Because I wouldn't really care if it hadn't happened to me  But I do know now what it's like  You know, to be on the other side  Right  You know what, Dave?  You're doing something cool for the show  You've got to give us a number  I don't have it 
[01:14:30]  I know  Tomorrow or Monday or something  Because there are people out there that'll  You know, because there are hundreds of people  That call people on the phone every night  And it would do better for it to go on your show  And that's not a plug for someone trying to get over  Or someone trying to get their business going  Or something like that  How close are they to figuring something out, though?  It'll probably be like  We could have fixed you if it was ten years ago  Aww  You know how that is  But, you know, it'll probably  I'm sure sometime in my lifetime it'll be fixable 
[01:15:00]  But it'll probably be where it's too late for me  Aww  I don't know  And in my sense  They say that there is hope that someday there will be a  You know, a chance that  Obviously I don't have the machinery, as y'all just saw  But that they could hook some sort of camera device up to my brain  Or something like that  But I've been blind since I'm five  And I'm just happy this way  Yeah  I don't want to have to look at the sorry bastards I call my friends  So, I'm just dandy  Hey Bill, are you in shock yet? 
[01:15:30]  I can't believe it  I'm on the website, too  Hoping you guys will pop something on there  We just sent the pictures  They're going to be up on WNEW.com  Oh, and here  There's a picture that Steve was brave enough to take  Because Rick pushed out  And what, you took a picture of Matt with the eye out of his  Yeah, I got one real close-up shot of Matt's left eye socket  Yes  And then one of him holding the glass eye up and smiling  Proudly  Yes, very proudly  Matt, you rock 
[01:16:00]  And let me tell you  The guys who made these eyes  A little plug for LeGrand Associates  Are they hell of artists or what?  Yeah  Hand-painted, baby  Dave, you have a driver's license?  My friend who  I don't know if he's out here or not  In here or not  He's outside  I was legally blind, right?  And it was almost four years ago  This October  It was like in November or whatever  I didn't have the cane yet  And I could see good enough where I could pass myself off 
[01:16:30]  And my friend goes  And in Connecticut, you don't have to take an eye test  You just renew your license  So my friend goes  Okay, it's like ten paces  And then feel the blue carpet  And there's a chair  About three steps to the right  Sit down in it  Don't mess up  And then I went  And I got my picture taken  And I was legally blind  I don't drive  So I'm not out to kill nobody  But um  That's hilarious  And then I went up  They called my name  And he was renewing his license  And it was an invisible ink pen  And he goes 
[01:17:00]  Oh no, he's not going to know  And I just went up  And I felt my pockets  And I go  Damn it, I forgot my reading glasses  Can you put my finger where I got a sign?  And we walked out of there  And he's laughing his ass off  And I'm like  What?  And he goes  You're blind  And they just renewed your license  And that's fact  You know what?  He's not kidding  I'm holding his license  In front of me  And it's valid  And I had a CDL  For driving large trucks  Nice  I was a tree worker  I drove chip trucks 
[01:17:30]  And bucket trucks  You know  That was my thing, man  Unbelievable  Did he have a thing  On the license  That says  Corrective lenses needed?  Yeah, it did  And that's why  The guy didn't bitch  About the reading glasses  I said  You know  You see  It says right there  He's like  Yeah, here  Move your finger this way  And I was like  I can't believe  This guy's doing this  If I get away with it  This October  That would be  Yeah, now  If you do it again  I think you guys  Should camera and mic me 
[01:18:00]  For it  Yeah  Because I'll try  We'll broadcast the whole thing  We'll do that  We'll take bets  And everything  Let's see if Dave  Can renew his license again  Yeah, it's October  So you guys have no problem  With the blind boxing?  No, we're going to give it a shot  Give it a shot and stuff  We got bells  That helps  All right  What about the dog, Matt?  I'll leave him somewhere  Where he can't see  Yeah, I don't want to be getting bit  Because if the dog sees Dave attacking you  He's going to  He may not be thrilled  He's not going to be too happy  So we'll leave him where I won't be  Yeah, yeah  We'll put him somewhere  I'll trust one of you guys  To lead me not into walls

Yeah  Oh, you're the man  Remember that there's at least two blind guys listening  That's cool  So the best detail you can give is there  I gotta remember that  Remember that, dude  You're no, you know, you're not like, who's the, Walt Clyde Frazier  Used to do the color commentary for the Knicks on the radio  Yeah  You gotta do some more bopping and dropping and slipping  And whatnot  That drives me nuts when Frazier starts using words I don't know

[01:33:30]  Dave said it  Not me  Yeah that's one place  One time I would want to trade places  With my brother  Come on  Was she really that hot or what  Yes she was  All right  Other than that  You're not helping me too much  Cliff  Come on  Dave take it easy man  I just want to wish you good luck  And get my brother home safe man  All right  I'll drive safe man  Okay keep your eyes on the road  Hey Dave  Yeah  Tell that guy to keep his eyes  In his socket  So you don't get your gloves  Stuck in there man  He has an advantage 
[01:34:00]  If he takes his eyes out  Yeah you can see Matt  That's an idea Cliff  It's an idea  There's a picture of Matt  With his eye popped out  On WNEW.com  Yeah check it out  The website is just getting pounded  Cliff that's as bad as  Anybody with a weak stomach  Check it out  It's an interesting picture  I need the headphones  To know if Opie's going to  Throw anything at me  No I'm not going to throw anything  No we won't throw anything at you  You know I'm pretty twisted  I'm pretty sick  Trust me  I'm not doing anything today  Nothing  I got on the Amtrak  I am really creeped out 
[01:34:30]  About today's event  This bit runs itself  Yes  I got something I think is funny  Alright  I got on the Amtrak  Coming back from Boston  Right  Yeah  And it's very dark in there  So I'm completely blind  So I feel the backrest of seats  To see if there's an open seat  As I'm going down the aisle  Because I'm too ignorant  To ask for help  And I touch  And there's no one in their seat  And there's people behind me  And I say  You know is anyone sitting there  And these guys go no  And this woman apparently 
[01:35:00]  Had Tourette's  And I've heard about it  And I've heard it on TV  And this and that  But so I go  So I stick my cane in  And my cane hits her  And she goes  And I jump back  Into the people behind me  And go  And they're like  And she's going  And I'm like  And she's trying not to say the F word  But it comes out  And she starts screaming it 
[01:35:30]  And I'm just like  Oh my god  And she goes  And then she goes  I have Tourette's  And I knew  And I always thought  It was a gag  But I knew  I sat two seats ahead of her  And the train broke down twice  Thank you Amtrak  And I knew  Any time  That there was an  African American gentleman  Coming by us  No way  I thought it was a gag  But for God's sakes  Every time  Someone 
[01:36:00]  African American descent  Came by  She started going  Nick  Nick  Nick  Nick  Nick  Nick  Nick  No way  I swear to God  And I'm two seats ahead of her  And I'm  And you know  And people are like  Oh that's horrible  And I'm like  And I'm like  Laughing uncontrollably  Trying to hold my mouth  Laughing  You know  And I told one of my friends  I was like  I really saw one of those  Therese people  You know  I was like  Well I didn't see him  I heard her  And he's like  And he goes  Man that's bad 
[01:36:30]  You shouldn't be laughing at that  Look at what's happening to you  You shouldn't be laughing at other people  And I said  Well you know my theory  Hey  If you can't laugh at yourself  Make fun at other people  You know  But it was  It was funny  And there was a couple of  African American gentlemen  Who were very peeved  I guess  And she was yelling  Throughout the car  The N word  Going  Nick  Nick  Nick  Nick  Nick  Nick  Nick  Nick  And then it would just come out  The full blown  You better just wear like 
[01:37:00]  One of those  Ball in the mouth things  Wherever you go  To keep you out of trouble  If you got that problem  Working for you  Wow  Oof  And the most common  Question asked  By people who  Used to see  Who go blind  By their friends  Is how do you know  When you're done  Wiping your ass  You know  There's a guy in the line  And I didn't even  Want to go there  What's the answer though  I didn't want to go there  But  How do you know  You just keep wiping 
[01:37:30]  Right  The wind feels  See  Blind people probably  Got the cleanest  Butts around  They just keep going  I thought maybe  You just smelt it  That's a trick too  Use your sense  To smell it  No  It's still a little  Summer  Charlie  Yeah  What's up  I want to know  If you guys  Are going to do this  I like hear no evil  See no evil  Where each one of you guys  Get on their shoulders  And tell them  What time to hit them at  12 o'clock  1 o'clock  No  It's it  They're going to have bells  Steven 
[01:38:00]  Wait till 12  And 1 o'clock  We'll be here all night  Right  Kenny  Yo  Hey  Hey  What's up  You guys shot  A bottle rocket  Out of a girl's  Intimate part  And you're worried  About two guys  Hitting each other  I thought you were going to say  I should shoot a bottle rocket  Out of my eye socket  Not happening  No no no no  Let's start the bell guys  Let's go  Alright Kenny  Thank you  Are you on the Prozac  Or the Zoloft  Yeah how are you going to do  In the fighting 
[01:38:30]  I hear you're almost  Taking the Zoloft  Yeah  Yeah  I was  I was on  They gave me a Paxil  They gave you Paxil instead  Yeah  I was like  What insane  Does that help blindness  Give me some  See for this  I went like  Insane  Did you  I went back to the doctor  And I had a bag  Full of these boxes  And I threw them out  And he goes  How'd that work out  I was like  Well I went up  In a hospital  In Lowell Massachusetts  I thought I was going to die  And he's like 
[01:39:00]  Oh so those weren't working out  I went to see the guy  This morning  A month and a half ago  I went on the wagon  Which I'm obviously off  Got it  Dr. Robin  If you're listening  This is just a radio gag  And  He thought I was on Paxil all this time  And I was like  No you moron  And he goes  Well that's why I was so afraid  To give you the Xanax  And I was like  Give me the Xanax  Yeah  You should have went on the Zoloft though 
[01:39:30]  And then come off  I'm on the Xanax  So I don't kill you all  Frank what's going on  But that's to deal with the blindness  Hey Frank  Hey guys  This is wrong  You're crossing the line  I mean  Which next  Hemophiliac knife fighting  Shut up Frank  Hemophiliac knife fighting  Nice  Frank shut up  Do they have AIDS as well  Or just  That's blind man  I have to ask both of you 
[01:40:00]  You guys are completely cool  With this  No I'm  I'm very offended  I'm just trying to get my  My fighting career back  So I figure  If I go in and  Punch Matt in the uterus  And  Fight his ears off  Cause I have been  Preparing for the fight  By going off the Zoloft  For a couple of days  So  Because of the I-Mist  Dave  Um  Okay  Um  I'm sorry 
[01:40:30]  What?  I lost my big fat cowboy hat  Blind Steve's on the line  Blind Steve  Steven  Matty you gotta do it up to this  You pussy  Come on baby  Yeah  This is the guy that Dave was supposed to fight  Originally  Blind Steve  Sorry I'm getting fully employed  Oh come on  What couldn't make it?  No I'm working dude  No I couldn't  I couldn't handle a beating again  Oh whatever  Whoa  What's up Steve?  What's the way to tell you? 
[01:41:00]  I'm gonna do what you told me coach  Oh  Let's get the games going  You're wasting time  I might be able to go through a break  It's about the fight  Alright Steve  I got  But I'm gonna give it  Mike  Steve  Like the Pink Floyd song  Wish you were here  Mike  Yeah yeah  Turn the radio down  Turn the radio down  What?  Hey Mike  Turn the radio down  Alright  Radio's off  Alright what's up  We got blind Matt and blind Dave in the studio  Hey what's up guys  What's up you're live  Let's go  Dude I'm telling you what 
[01:41:30]  This is the funniest stuff I've ever heard  I'm holding it down here in Columbus  I'm driving my truck around  I've never laughed out loud  At anything on the radio in my life before  You guys are rocking  I love it  Hey Mike  Hey Mike  I'll be in Columbus this weekend  If you want to come down to say hello  Where are you gonna be?  Wait where are you gonna be in Columbus?  We're gonna be at some hotel  He doesn't know  He doesn't have to know  Why are you gonna be in Columbus Matt?  Steve and I play on a team called the Long Island Bombers  Which is a blind game of baseball for folks who are blind 
[01:42:00]  Well yeah blind game of baseball  Blind baseball  It's a modified game of baseball that we play  We're coming out there to have a tournament against a lot of other blind teams  Right  Oh cool  So we'll be out there  We're flying out tomorrow  We'll be in Columbus Saturday and Sunday  Come on down and I will not take my eye out for you  Alright  There you go Mike  Hey take care man  Alright bye  What's your record there?  Oh you know what  We lost once this year to them bastards from Keyspan  Thanks for all the money Keyspan  But don't beat us next year  These guys play to win man  They peek through their blindfolds 
[01:42:30]  Oh they're sighted teams that have to wear blindfolds  Yeah out here we play basically our corporate sponsors  So we have to take these long trips to Columbus to play other blind teams  But yeah our only loss this year against corporate sponsors is to Keyspan  Those cats play to win and God bless them  That Jack Daniels holy Jesus  Dave slow down  We gotta still get you to box  Dave's making it easy  Slow down  Slow down  What's your batting average?  This year dude I think I made out once out of like 10 outs 
[01:43:00]  About 10 times a bat  Blah blah blah  Yeah  Because our pitcher's on our team  It's not like he's trying to strike us out  Right  You know it's like he throws it in the wheelhouse  He knows where you swing  Wait there's a blind pitcher too?  No no he's a sighted pitcher  Okay and then what happens like what do you do you hear the ball?  Yeah the ball beeps but it's not about hearing the ball when you bat it's all about timing  You don't necessarily have to hear it you just have to time it when the pitcher pitches he says ready pitch releases the ball you wait about a second and let it go  The base is a foam tower that stands about 3 feet tall and also beeps a different tone and you run as fast as you can until you trip over the base 
[01:43:30]  And if you get there before another blind guy fields the ball it's a run  If the blind guy fields the ball first you're out  Oh so he's just gotta grab the ball  That's it  If you play sighted teams they have to stand on the outfield grass until we hit the ball then they field the ball and throw it home to the catcher  Catcher has to touch the plate before we get to the base  They need to have blind people catching the balls  That would be something 
[01:44:00]  Imagine how long a baseball game would go for  If we catch the ball on the fly it's 3 outs  Triple play  Alright  Wow  But you know it's something you know we were thinking a couple years ago a challenge in 0 and 8 to a game  We realize you guys may be big time for us but if you guys ever consider it man we'd love to play as  We'll just drink till we're blind and then  Then we'll play as  And then we'll lose  That's it  Mark  I got a 135 average in bowling  Yeah  I just started like a month ago man 
[01:44:30]  Really?  You know what I think I could do that  And they said  You know  You just feel where the gutters are  You walk up to the line you feel where the gutters are with your feet and you get in the middle and heave the ball you know  And you got a 135 average and there's no  I got like 4 strikes in one game  And they weren't in my lane  And the pens aren't  The pens aren't beeping or anything  They ask you Massachusetts  There's a lot of blind people  It's like the blind state in Massachusetts 
[01:45:00]  They're like  They're like  Would you like a lane with bumpers?  Bumper lane  What the hell are bumpers?  And they're like  So when your blind ass throws the ball down the thing  It won't bother anyone else and go into their lane  I'm like  Nah  I think I'll just take the regular  But in all seriousness  For bowlers who are blind  There's a blind bowling league here in the city  What they have is a rail  And they set this rail up like in the middle of the lane 
[01:45:30]  And you can run down the rail  But you gotta do it for real  It's ridiculous  I don't like the lane either  Run down the rail?  My bowling technique is to squat  Put the ball between my legs  And push it like a sissy  It's alright  That's like someone letting you push the gas pedal on their car  And say you're driving  You know  It ain't real man  You know  Frank from  I drive a dirt bike man  My friend's 250 Enduro  I feel with my left foot  And my right foot  I get in the middle of his dirt road  I lay it out through first 
[01:46:00]  Popped second  And hit third  And then come up to an abrupt stop  And feel that  Damn that tree would have hurt  You know what  You know what I think  I hope that the listeners  It's extreme  I hope I think  You gotta live  I think the listeners should get from this  That you know  While we're sitting here  Spoofing on our blindness a little bit  And I'm popping my eye out for the show  Which is something I haven't done  Since I'm like 16  I know  I'm sorry  Well that's fine  That's about the mindset of this show  Yeah that's where we're at mentally man  You know what guys  The real message is  On the serious side 
[01:46:30]  We do everything and anything  Including popping our eyes out for a little fun  Now let me tell you one thing  I'm sure not getting on a bike  And blindfolding myself  And popping third gear  You know  That's great  My friend's father never knew  I was riding a bike  Up at his house  In the country  You know  Like in  Upstate Connecticut  The country  There's a little open doorway  And I hit third gear  And accidentally popped a wheelie  Almost had a heart attack  And like  Went up for like two seconds 
[01:47:00]  And instead of like  Letting off the throttle  I laid down on the bike  And my friend's father's like  Jeez if I didn't know any better  I'd swear that was like  Pace  Driving by  Riding a wheelie  And he was like  That was Pace  And he's riding by  His friend's like  You know  How do you do that  I'm like  Well  You never lose it dude  And I'm like  Nah  Scared the crap out of myself  I don't know what the hell  I'm doing  You know  Frank  Frank from New York  Quickly  Wants to know  He says  That Matt plays for a blind baseball team 
[01:47:30]  He wants to know  If it's the New York Mets  Oh  Hold on  Why  Frank we beat them  They're terrible  In my travels  Mets go  Mets go  In my travels of Boston  Yeah  I can tell you one thing  Never  Even if you're blind  And you have a cane  And people feel sorry for you  Never be in a sports bar  And say  The Red Sox suck  No but I'll tell you  Because they will beat the crap out of you 
[01:48:00]  And lynch you  I'll tell you the funniest thing  Go Sox  Cancel your appointments  Psycho Mark wants to get paid now for that  I'll tell you what the funniest thing  For a blind guy to do in a bar is  And that's to say  Hey I'm blind  Give me the darts  Everyone darts  Got some house darts  Hey Mark what's going on?  Hey how about next week on ONA  Pregnant women kickboxing  Pregnant woman kickboxing  Write that down Ant  That's nice  Thank you  Alright 
[01:48:30]  Well  I  Okay  I feel good about this now  You're feeling better about other guys  Alright  Dave should we get a little hate going?  What do you mean?  I don't know  Shouldn't we hate each other or something?  Oh no  Don't start bad mouthing each other  I'm kidding  It's like  As the bottle turns  So does Dave's frustrated anger towards Matt  You should let Matt feel the JD bottle  To see  To see sorry 
[01:49:00]  To feel how much Dave just drank  Outside he says  Blind guys know the shape of every liquor bottle out there  That's it baby  I've been on the wagon for like a month and a half  And two days ago  I thought I was coming here  And I put  I bought ten shooters of Jack Daniels  And I put them in my little fridge  I have a refrigerator in my room  Cause that's what a beer drinker I was  And um  If you need it  Now we switch to Jack  And I uh  It was like  Okay  I'll wait till tomorrow  Or the next day  When I go on the show 
[01:49:30]  That's when I'm gonna  I'm gonna go off the wagon  But you're getting all itchy  Cause you knew they were there  And I heard this little  Hey  Come on  We're in here  Come on  Come on  You know you  You know you want it  You know you want it  And then I heard little clamoring around  You know  Like I went to the blind school  I came home  My parents had kittens  It was like having the gremlins in your house  And I was like  I hear  I hear this little creaking around 
[01:50:00]  And things knocking over  I'm like  What the hell is that  Like gremlins  Yeah  And that's why I called them  I was like  I came back  I was like  You got gremlins in the house  What the hell is his  Classic  But the little  The little booze bottle  So two days ago  So if we had to fight yesterday  I would have been beaten  Miserably  You should have fought yesterday  And right now  I'm borderlining on being so drunk  That  It's gonna be really rough for me  Alright  So I'm gonna lay off  The Jack Daniels for a while

[01:57:00]  Yeah we should do that  I think they're  Getting their equipment  On right now  Yeah  Putting the headgear on  And the gloves  And  I don't know  What the hell  Is gonna happen  We realized  We didn't have ropes  For the ring  Right  Because you know  We don't have a ring  We got outside  And we're gonna  Put a couple of interns there  So they could push them  Back into the fighting area  Pretty much  Tell around  That they're  Stepping out of the ring  All right  Oh my god  All right  Let's go outside  All right  You go first 
[01:57:30]  All right  I don't know  How this is gonna  Play out  Because  They don't want  The bells on  They can't see  I just picture  Flailing wildly  Until someone connects  I don't really see it  See it really turning  Into a boxing match  Anthony  You all right there  Yeah okay  Let me get outside  It's crazy out here  Wait wait wait 
[01:58:00]  Dave  Dave come over here  Dave over here  Over here  You gotta do that  For the radio  He's imitating  Kevin Meaney  Anthony  Hold on  Let me get a mic  In front of you  I'm all tangled up here  Yeah that chair  Has to be moved  What's the matter  I can't see my  I don't know  Where my cigarette is  That's not right  What's the matter  With you  Pulling your eyes  Out on national  Internet  You're like a crazy person 
[01:58:30]  Popping your eye out  You're not right  Look at you  Pulling your blindfold down  Yeah wait a minute  You gotta put your  Blindfold back on  See blind Dave  Can only see  Little things alike  Little shapes  But he sees a little bit  And he wants to be fair  To blind Matt  Who's completely blind  Matt's completely  He's bring the dog in blind  You better take this off  I gotta fix this  Alright hold on  Stinky  What's the matter with you 
[01:59:00]  You're screwed it all  Okay  You're not right  What's the matter  You don't see your other  Wide friends  Going on radio stations  Boxing  Making a fool of yourself  You're like a  You're like a crazy person  Aren't you  You're just crazy  So hammered  I know  Steve from  Foundrymusic.com  Are you taking all this in  This is some of the best video  I have ever  Ever taped  In two and a half years  This is priceless  What does he say now 
[01:59:30]  I heard the hammered statement  Blind people can hear  We're not retards  That's right  We're not retarded  Hey I need a piece of paper  Because I'm one of the judges  Ben's one of the judges  Where's Ben?  Ben can come out here  Let's run through the rules  Yeah  We're going to do three  Two minute rounds  Correct  And there's a three knockdown rule  If someone gets knocked down  Three times  In one round  The fight's over  A slip will be deemed  A slip  Not a knockdown  And there might be  A couple of those  We'll judge this 
[02:00:00]  On the  Ten point must system  The winner of each round  Getting ten points  The loser  You could give them  Seven, eight or nine points  And  I don't know  If it's going to go that way  I think it's just going to be  Flailing  Until someone gets hit  And knocked out  I can't see this working  Any other way  And they want to  Do four rounds  You guys want to do four rounds  How many rounds  Do you want to do guys  It's going to take  A little endurance  As he's puffing on his butt 
[02:00:30]  Three  Two  Four  Wait a minute  What's the matter with you  I don't have a cigarette  In my mouth  Wait a minute  You're going to be  Boxing in a second  Don't be  You can't have a cigarette  In your mouth  As you box  When you're boxing  The Jack Daniels  The butts  He's ready to rock  I like it  You're whacked out  Aren't you  All right  Hey  Stinky  Let's talk to Matt  Matt you ready to go  I'm ready baby  You look good 
[02:01:00]  Ready to rock  You look really good  I got my foam face working  I see that  Yeah we got the headgear on them  Real boxing gloves  Now Matt  Are you going to close your eyes  During this  Because you don't need them  But if he hits you hard  I don't want one of those eyes  Flying out  Well if it flies out  Pick it up for me  He has two prosthetic eyes  So he completely can't see  Go to WNEW.com  If you think we're lying  There's a picture of him  With his eye popped out  I've been smacked about the head  Plenty of times  And the eyes stayed in  Oh really 
[02:01:30]  Okay  So there's no threat  Of those things  Flying out of your head  Hey guys  I got a good idea  Why don't we get the mic cords  Out of the ring  So the guys don't trip  These are for white men  With small penises  These are too small  He's hammered  That's a big boxing glove  I'm not hammered  You gotta be hammered  I saw so much  Jack Daniels being swigged  I've got a high tolerance  What's the matter with you  I'm an alcoholic  I can drink bottles of Jack Daniels  You know Dave  He could smoke with boxing gloves too 
[02:02:00]  That's amazing  Dave  You need to smoke as you do this  Just to answer  No  What are you crazy  It's too good man  Why would not  I've got to be smoking  You can smoke a cigarette  And then when he gets punched  In the face  And it gets broken  He'll really get pissed  All right  Are we ready to do this  All right  Let's guide the combatants  Into the ring  Wait  I'm going to strap my gloves  There's no  There are no straps  What do you mean  There's no  They're supposed to be  No there's no straps  They have bells on one hand 
[02:02:30]  I can't even make a fist with these  So when they swing that right hand  You're going to hear  The tinkling of the bells  Okay  No there's no straps  You just hold tight with a fist  They're walking Matt around the ring  So he gets kind of a feel  For what it's all about  The ring's about  We should be pretty accurate  Actually for these guys  What would you say  10 by 10  10 by 10  Is a good guess  You're the timekeeper  Dave's doing a little  A little practice punching 
[02:03:00]  Move your hands  Stink  Shadow box  You punch his stinking  In the stomach  He's got a good sense  Of where someone is  Even if he's  Yeah I know  Even though he can't see  He can hear very well  Walk Dave around the ring  So he gets a feel  For the size of the ring  And stuff  Dave it's 10 by 10  Wait a minute  Maybe I shouldn't have a cigarette  Yeah maybe you should put that down  Take the cigarette out  All right  Now let's guide him  Around the ring  I'd just like to say  That I have gone off  This is all off 
[02:03:30]  In preparation for the fight  Pete the engineer  Is horrified  I don't think he wants  This to go down  We're getting more  And more spectators  Down here  Well what I'd say  Is I'm used to  Smacking my women  About their head  And face  Matt doing Sean Connery  I'll smack that bitch  Shilling  All right  They are each  At a corner  Right now  And  I don't even know  How this is gonna work  I don't know  I think there's a better chance 
[02:04:00]  Of someone  Again the crowd  Getting punched  Where am I heading  Towards though  You're just  Yeah but you're not  Telling me where I'm  Going in the ring  You're going to go straight  That's just the perimeter  Of the ring  Put him in the corner  Face him in the right direction  And let's get down  To Brass Taxi  Let me see  Okay  All right  You got  They're feeling each other out here  All right hold on  Seeing how tall each other is  It kind of  Okay  All right  All right  Let's get to the corners  Yeah Dave  F you with a gay state  Dave get to your corner

[02:05:00]  Of the ring  So you can tell them  That they're out of the ring  Come back  Come back  Harry get over here  I'd rather us start  If you wouldn't mind  Tagging gloves  Yeah  No no shaking hands  But tag gloves  So we both know  Where each other are  Yeah all right  Move to center ring  Have the bell ring  Move to center ring  Are you okay with that  All right  Move Matt forward to Dave  Are you guys going to  Back up into your corner  After you touch gloves  Yeah I don't know  Where you are  I'm right here
