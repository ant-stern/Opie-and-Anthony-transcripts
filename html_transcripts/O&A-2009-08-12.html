<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a frustrated discussion about the complexities of SiriusXM's service and app,  followed by criticism of the new Alice in Chains album featuring Elton John.  A contentious interview with Artie Kornfeld, co-creator of Woodstock, dominated a significant portion, marked by the hosts' repeated mispronunciation of his name and skepticism towards his claims of not profiting from the festival.  Other topics included the closure of WBCN,  annoyance with Paul McCartney, the upcoming A&E show "Hoarders," an Ozzy Osbourne lawsuit, and continued debate about Woodstock's legacy.  E-Rock was mentioned as being upset after a segment where listeners called him fat, and a call from Matt from another station (AF) defended their improved signal reach. Artie Kornfeld was the only guest in studio during this segment.

The show then transitioned to a discussion about Artie Lange, replete with corn-related puns, followed by a dismissed promotional attempt by caller Debbie for Jimmy Norton's show.  This led to a conversation about “cool things going away,” specifically the decline of tailgating due to stadium greed, escalating into a wider critique of rising sports ticket prices and seat licenses.  Numerous listener calls contributed to the discussion, along with several clips of John Sterling's Yankees home run calls, criticized for their dramatic delivery and repetitive phrases. A baseball bench-clearing brawl and the long run to the pitcher’s mound were also discussed. The segment concluded with a heated internal conflict between staff members Danny and Little Nicky (Jerry), featuring a homophobic production piece mocking Danny, and speculation on its origins from Sam.  Eric got involved, leading to a heated exchange with Opie. Rich Vos and Patrice O’Neal were expected later in the broadcast.


The conflict between Danny and Little Nicky continued, focusing on how Little Nicky obtained audio clips of Danny.  Eric ("E-Rock"), Derek ("D-Boy Mathers"), and Kenny joined the argument, escalating with accusations, insults, and comparisons to video games.  Listener feedback further fueled the conflict.  Rich Vos then joined, providing comedic relief with a story about a poorly attended gig, followed by discussions about his near-public phone number, personal hygiene, the absurdity of masturbating in front of a mirror, and Patrice O'Neal's observation of an underlying issue troubling Danny.  Little Nicky initially avoided confrontation but later promised an explanation.  A lengthy discussion of various movies followed.


The Danny/Little Nicky conflict continued, with speculation about who informed Little Nicky of Danny's disparaging remarks.  E-Rock, Steve, Derek, and interns were considered as potential sources. D-Boy Mathers, Steve, and Troy Kwan were brought in for questioning. The competitive nature of production work and the various personalities involved were discussed. Little Nicky's production piece was played, followed by Danny's critique. Kenny was heavily implicated, and Patrice O'Neal provided commentary.  The segment included numerous comedic moments stemming from the absurdity of the situation and the hosts’ interactions.


The final segment featured Patrice O'Neal recounting experiences working with Brooke Shields, including her reaction to his behavior, a colon cleanse detail, and a comical on-set fall.  The conversation shifted to comparing Wendy Williams' and Oprah's audiences, and a critique of *The View*, focusing on the Cookie Monster's dietary change.  They also discussed Sherry Shepard's flat-earth belief and a contentious anecdote from Patrice O'Neal's TV appearance involving a heckler whose son had recently died.  The segment concluded with plugs for Patrice O'Neal and Rich Vos's upcoming comedy shows, with humorous confusion regarding O'Neal's Cleveland show dates. The segment contained frequent offensive language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Opie and Anthony, starring Jim Norton.  Hi!  Ready for another broadcast.  It's hump day.  That's it?  It's hump day.  That's it?  I thought it was...  We're dragging. We are dragging until Friday.  I thought it was...  Although the replay yesterday, I had it on most of the day because I was doing a lot of traveling.  Yeah.  Had to get a niece up to a college to check out that old gag. 
[00:00:30]  I'm sure there's a bunch of people that have been through that over the years.  And, yeah, the replay sounded good.  It sounded a bit silly.  Pretty funny.  Sounded like we were on some kind of nitrous gas or something.  Yeah, good stuff.  Good stuff, good stuff.  No, it's Whippin' Mount Wednesday. We know that, Ant.  And I think we got new, what, WOW stickers?  Yes, apparently there's new WOW stickers that feature the Sirius XM, not logo, but...  Collect them all.  Title.  How many now? 
[00:01:00]  After we're...  Counting the window clings.  History will show that we weren't allowed to have a WOW sticker when we invented Whippin' Mount Wednesday.  They frowned upon the old Whippin' Mount Wednesday, and they would not support it in any way.  No, up there in Baston.  That's why it was so cool in Boston, because all you saw were homemade WOW signs everywhere.  It was all underground.  In a way, it was cooler than the days of getting the WOW stickers on all the cars. 
[00:01:30]  But we got a brand new WOW sticker that says Sirius XM on it, and I don't know how you get them.  I gave up trying to figure out that stuff.  Where did they make them?  This place is very confusing, I just want to say.  Yes, Danny.  We just got them in, like, literally two weeks ago.  I haven't seen them, where are they?  I got them in the office, I'll show you some.  But how do they get them again?  They just...  Is there a promo running?  Yes, there is, actually.  And it gives all the info?  Keep listening to 202 or 197 if you're on Sirius, but we're here. 
[00:02:00]  I told you the other day.  I know.  Somebody asked me, how do I get your show?  And after he explained that he has Sirius, but he's got, like, an iPod, and he wants the app,  but maybe not because he's got it in the car, I looked at him, I threw my hands up in the air,  and I went, I don't know.  I don't know.  And I work here.  I go, I don't know.  That's what you've got to tell some people sometimes. 
[00:02:30]  I don't know.  I don't know.  And then it's confusing because we're 197 on one unit, we're 202 on the other unit.  Sometimes you can't even get it unless you have another type of subscription with one.  And then there's an online thing.  Which I completely have no clue about.  I'm not even trying to beat up the company.  This isn't taking the paper, rolling it up, and hitting him over the nose.  Yeah.  But it is very confusing.  And I realized that the other day when someone asked me flat out, how do I get your show? 
[00:03:00]  And after explaining a couple things, I just had to go, I don't know.  I really don't know how you do that.  And then I signed up for my SiriusXM app.  You know?  So I had to sign up for that.  Right.  So I could listen to the show?  Sure.  And I hit the thing.  And now I get that I'm not signed up anymore.  Like my free month or something or two weeks or whatever is over. 
[00:03:30]  But I paid for it.  I put it in my credit card.  I never...  Wait, you're paid up and you don't get it?  I don't know.  I'll say what you said.  I don't know.  And I'm not trying to be a dick.  I mean, this is what I'm hearing out there.  I do talk to the people.  And I mean, this crap that it's SiriusXM, enough already.  Pick a name and let's go with it.  It's ridiculous.  Go with one service, one platform, one everything.  We're an XM show that walks into the Sirius facility every day. 
[00:04:00]  It's one company now.  Yeah.  So you make it one company.  Oh boy, they're going to owe me.  You make it one company and you make everything match up.  That's it.  If you want to keep us on 202, which I think is stupid too, I think you should move us down  the dial, but that's a discussion for another day.  I can explain why if you really care about radio.  But it should be 202 on both units.  Simple as that.  And you know what?  The best of the package?  Get rid of it.  Yeah, just get rid of it already.  Stop.  Just make it one simple thing.  One thing. 
[00:04:30]  Your boys, Opie and Anthony, talk to a much bigger audience if you get rid of that.  And then maybe you make the money back with the ad dollars.  Maybe.  I don't know the business side of it that well, but I would assume that wouldn't be  too crazy to think.  What's wrong with your app?  My app seems to be working.  It does?  I'll show you in a second.  I'm going to the Boneyard to listen to fucking Dio.  You can't go to the Boneyard.  You've got a radio show to do.  I want to go to the Boneyard.  But see, what Dio song? 
[00:05:00]  Dio has such a distinctive sound, don't they?  He really does.  The headphones, this is amazing.  Of course.  Oh, it's very exciting.  Actually, a great reception on this.  Unfortunately, the phone doesn't, but the SiriusXM app does.  Yeah, it's very exciting.  I mean, the SiriusXM app is awesome.  Have they had like a million downloads or something?  I think way more than that now.  They stopped keeping track.  And now my username is invalid because it's been so long since I've used it, I can't 
[00:05:30]  remember what my username is.  Oh, isn't that the worst?  I hate when that happens.  And it happens all the time.  But the headline is, I had to tell the guy, I don't know.  So, you know, I could have helped our cause by pointing the guy in the right direction.  And I was too confused.  I go, I don't know.  And he goes, I guess I'll call customer service, but he said the last time I called customer  service, that didn't go too well.  Good luck.  Have fun.  All right.  Anyway, I guess the other thing, we just want to say that the SiriusXM wow stickers are 
[00:06:00]  out there and there's a promo running on whatever channel you listen to to get the Opie and  Anthony show.  I would love to just say 202, but then there's 197 out there too.  Yeah.  All right.  And then I pointed this out to Anthony literally seconds before he went on the air.  Why does everything that is cool, like, get ruined?  Just, yeah, something has to happen that wrecks it.  Listen to this.  And there will be moans out there. 
[00:06:30]  New Alice in Chains album.  A lot of people are excited about this.  Me, not so much, because I thought Alice in Chains really was Lane Staley.  Yeah, yeah.  Although Jerry Cantrell is an unbelievable talent and knew how to harmonize.  And he did his part, absolutely.  But Lane Staley was just...  But it's not the band.  He was the heart of Alice in Chains.  But, I mean, they're moving on and they sound pretty good and there's a nice little buzz  and they got a new album coming out and that's fine.  And honestly, I'll download it and I'll check it out.  I will.  New Alice in Chains album. 
[00:07:00]  Here's a headline for you.  Includes song with Elton John.  Ugh.  Why?  Did you hear the moans out there from the Alice in Chains fans?  Why?  Why would you do that?  What?  That's not...  That's not cool.  Right.  Everything cool just goes away eventually.  It's not a cool thing to do.  And does anyone know what this Alice in Chains, Elton John song is all about?  Oh.  Yeah, I know. 
[00:07:30]  You do, Travis?  Either Lady Di or AIDS or what?  It's a tribute to Lane Staley.  He plays piano on it.  Oh.  And they suggested getting Elton John because he was a huge influence apparently on Lane  Staley.  So they jokingly decided to email him and he did it.  Well, Elton John's going to do anything.  You're kidding?  He's never said no.  That's true.  I don't think Elton John ever said no to a project.  Nope.  The only thing he's ever said no to is Vagina in Six.  He rewrote the same song, what, four times? 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, yeah.  You know, this guy doesn't know the word no.  It started off with goodbye Harry Chapin.  Right.  Forget it.  And he's working on one for Michael Jackson.  Guess what it's called?  Fucking goodbye.  So that could be a theme for today's show.  Everything cool goes away.  Petto in the wind. 
[00:08:30]  Now we need some Elton John song.  Yeah, right.  That could be one of the themes today, though.  Everything cool goes away.  Give us examples.  Do you have an example?  Do you have an example?  Oh, wow.  Now I'm on the spot.  What?  I'm on the spot.  Basically, it's everything cool goes away.  Maybe something with Ozzy.  Maybe something with your favorite TV show.  Well, one thing we...  Maybe with radio.  Paul McCartney is not cool.  Why isn't Paul McCartney cool?  Look at these stupid songs. 
[00:09:00]  Is this fucking old lady fucking look now that he has?  Well, he's 67.  Well, it doesn't matter the reason.  I wasn't asked a reason.  I just said what...  You know.  He dedicated Michelle to Michelle Obama when he was in Obama.  When he was in D.C.  And this shit song.  This shitty song.  He just wants to dance the night away.  Although, he hasn't been cool in quite a while.  Tell you the truth.  Was he ever cool?  Yeah, he was kind of cool.  John Lennon was the cool one.  Dude.  John Lennon was the cool one. 
[00:09:30]  No.  Team John Lennon right here.  I know you're Team John Lennon, but when you see him sing, like, Let It Be, where he had the big beard and shit.  Yeah, he was cool when he had the beard.  That was pretty cool.  When he was working the beard, absolutely.  Yeah.  Like, that was cool.  This is great.  But he hasn't been...  Ugh.  You know what?  Is everyone going to dance around?  What a small thought this is.  This is such a small thought.  It's a tiny little thought.  Everybody's going to feel all right.  That just proves how powerful you are if you're a Beatle. 
[00:10:00]  You can have just a tiny little thought and make a song out of it.  Who's going to...  I just think...  Everyone's going to dance around and feel all right.  It's just idiocy.  Yeah, it sucks.  Cool.  That's a good one.  Uh-huh.  Pretty much FM radio.  FM radio used to be cool.  Yeah.  To listen to.  You'd turn on FM radio and...  Like, there was your local station that you listened to.  It rocked.  Dude, I used to...  You knew the personalities.  Oh, I used to love that more than anything. 
[00:10:30]  Big events that went on and did things.  When you drove from town to town.  It was a whole different sounding station.  And there were events.  Big concerts and shit.  And now it's just...  Ugh.  They get the cheapest jock.  Shove him somewhere where he could play what the slide rule has picked for music.  Yeah.  And...  That was all changing as we were making our mark. 
[00:11:00]  That's why that was so weird for us.  Like, we were on this rocket ship with our show and everything.  Yeah.  As the business itself was kind of ruining itself.  The business was self-destructing beneath our feet.  And if you don't think this business is ruining itself, listen to this.  I get in my car this morning only to hear Lady Gaga on WBCN.  WBCN.  Ugh.  Hilarious.  FM radio is truly dead.  Love you guys.  Mike from Boston.  He wrote that before we even started talking about how everything cool goes away. 
[00:11:30]  Freaking BCN was the cool rock station for many, many years.  Yeah.  And not only is BCN officially gone now, they're a sports station.  BCN is now a sports station on another frequency.  And then they moved like a pop station where BCN used to be.  It's all confusing up there in Boston today.  It's all done now, right?  I believe so.  I heard it was supposed to start on the 13th, which is tomorrow.  But maybe they went a day early or something.  I don't know.  Whatever. 
[00:12:00]  They included us in the montage of pictures of people that worked at BCN.  Oh, did they?  Yeah, boston.com or something like that.  Oh, isn't that sweet.  Oh, see, I have it right here, as a matter of fact.  What, BCN?  This is BCN?  Yes.  This is the old WBCN, the legend.  This is great.  This is what they're playing this morning.  The radio people are very smart.  They've done a good job.  But it's not BCN.  They confused everybody up there.  It's mix or something?  They moved another radio station to where BCN used to be.  This says WBCN 98.5 FM HD2. 
[00:12:30]  What does that mean?  I don't know.  It's too long.  Dude, BCN HD2 90.  Shut up.  That HD.  That would fucking blow us a dick.  Nobody fucking enjoys that.  And they keep trying to push the HD thing.  Oh, why don't they just fucking stop it?  What?  HD1.  I don't know what that is.  They got HD1, 2, 3, 4.  And just so you guys know, the HD and HD radio doesn't really stand for anything at all.  It's not higher definition. 
[00:13:00]  It's the same bit rate as regular radio.  Is it?  Yeah, they just know that HD on a consumer level is recognizable as something better than the regular.  So they just tack HD on.  I'd love to line radio executives up and then make them say what HD is in front of an audience.  And when they can't give the real explanation, just fucking hammer their feet with a fucking rock.  Like they're bare feet.  They're in a suit and bare feet.  You mash their feet with a rock.  I thought you were going to say I would like to line up all the radio executives and then pull their ball bags until they don't stretch anymore. 
[00:13:30]  That would be great.  And then continue pulling.  And the whole time you're pulling their ball bag, they have to say focus group.  Focus group.  Consultant.  Consultant.  What is that?  It says BCN and there's Freeform BCN HD3.  Oh.  And then there's The Rock of Boston Still Listen Live on 98.5 FM HD2.  And then there's...  What the...  You know...  What shit?  They have so fucked up radio. 
[00:14:00]  They overthink everything.  No one knows where to get any of these things anymore.  Sam, no one gives a shit about your interview with one of the fathers of Woodstock.  Artie Kornfeld.  Who the fuck was he?  You got an interview with Artie Kornfeld?  Yeah.  Which one was he?  Yeah, which one was he?  How'd you do that?  He's the father of Woodstock.  Who doesn't know that?  Pop a picture of him up there.  Do you really need one?  Dan.  Yeah.  I don't know which guy that is.  Artie Kornfeld, right there. 
[00:14:30]  Did he tell you they were a half a million strong during the interview?  No violence, one death, boo.  Yeah, what did...  Oh, that guy.  Did he quote any of those dumb...  Which guy?  He's not the other guy.  Which guy?  The other guy had the afro.  This is the father of Woodstock.  What did he do?  He fathered it.  What does that mean?  He fathered it.  He told me he made a million and a half bucks by himself for Woodstock.  Yeah?  Bringing tickets.  Has everyone else starved to death?  What about...  It wasn't about the money man.  He said that.  He said that.  He said that. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, he did?  Yes, it wasn't.  He hasn't made...  In 40 years, he said he hasn't made one cent off Woodstock.  Well, that's a dumb business, man.  Yeah, greatest concert of all time, and he hasn't made a cent in 40 years.  Brilliant now?  What a fool.  What a fool, all right.  What an idiot.  How about something called copyright?  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  That's Artie Kornfeld.  Is it?  He wrote like a...  Who's that hot blonde?  His wife?  No, I don't know her.  He wrote a ton of songs?  Yeah, name one.  I don't know what to do.  For real, name one.  Yeah, what did Artie Kornfeld write? 
[00:15:30]  How many songs did he write?  A lot.  All right, name one.  Let's Google Action that.  How about you talk to the guy?  He must have told you one that he's been proud of.  He was on tour with Sonny and Cher, singing in front of big crowds.  What did he say?  He warmed up the audience.  He was probably the mic tester.  Listen, I don't understand where all this Artie Kornfeld hostility is coming from today.  Jealousy.  Oh.  And who doesn't want to be Artie Kornfeld?  That makes sense.  40 years in and you haven't made a cent.  Right.  I certainly don't want to.  What does he think?  His second opportunity is coming, by the way? 
[00:16:00]  Dope.  He let me know.  I want to explore why this guy hasn't made a cent in 40 years.  How have you?  Not one poster?  Something called Woodstock.  He has an internet radio show that has 10 million listeners.  No, he doesn't.  He told me.  No one has.  No, he doesn't.  He told me that.  No, he doesn't.  I think the only one that might have 10 million is like Rush Limbaugh.  Maybe.  And?  And Artie.  Shut up.  He told me.  Artie Kornfeld.  He told me.  Or is it Kornfeld?  Kornfeld.  Let's call him Kornfield.  Well, it should be Kornfield.  That's where he threw the concert. 
[00:16:30]  Right, exactly.  From now on, he's already Kornfield.  There was one, I think, of Beach Boys.  Little old lady from Pasadena.  How do you like that?  He wrote that?  Yeah, that's right.  I hate the fucking Beach Boys.  They're fucking terrible.  That's why.  You guys are crazy.  Pet sounds.  Come on.  They're fucking horrendous.  Yeah.  It's all this fruity harmonizing.  I was going to say mumbo.  No.  Listen to this.  Exactly.  This is beachy shit. 
[00:17:00]  All right.  Rod is very beachy.  Isn't it awful?  Very shit.  All right.  Where were we?  Trying to figure out what's going on in radio?  You want to look at Lulu in a fucking, in a hole of hope in fucking 1966?  Lulu.  Should we go with the big Artie Kornfeld interview?  K.S. Kornfeld is his name.  It's a banana field.  Yeah.  That's right.  Where they plant bananas.  Grow bananas.  Jesus.  That crossed my mind about two or three times yesterday at home.  And I just started laughing. 
[00:17:30]  Banana garden.  I'm an idiot.  All right.  So, everything cool goes away.  Yeah.  BCN.  What else?  You figure out the iPhone thing?  The app?  Not really?  No.  No.  I haven't figured that out.  I got to fucking find my goddamn sign in.  I have the, you know, AOL thing.  Right.  Which I was using to get BCN, but I wasn't sure if it's BCN, HD2, or if it's BCN, what 
[00:18:00]  they're playing over the air, which isn't BCN anymore.  It's something else.  I don't know.  How do they just say goodbye to a rock audience?  Like, that doesn't make sense.  Well, A.A.F. must be.  Boston's not a big college town.  Yeah.  They don't like.  Yeah.  Boston doesn't like their college music.  Nah.  It's not a big college town.  So.  Thank God.  They picked the right city to get rid of rock and roll music.  Get another sports station in there.  That's what they need.  Don't they have at least two or three?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, let's add another sports station and get rid of all the music the kids love. 
[00:18:30]  Now, I like that extreme local sports talk.  How many colleges are in the Boston area?  That they just basically said, fuck you, too.  Yeah.  Here you go.  Don't listen to us anymore.  Right.  That's pretty much what it's going to be.  And A.A.F. would be jumping up and down today if they had a good signal to reach all  those colleges.  Yeah.  But I hear pretty soon they're going to have a good signal.  Remember that?  Yeah.  They were trying to keep us at A.F. 
[00:19:00]  And they're like, no, man.  Next year, we're going to have the permit to get the big tower with the big signal.  Next year, we get the big stick.  Bullshit these assholes tell you on a daily basis.  The big stick, boys.  He did call it the big stick.  Remember he drew circles?  Oh, I know.  He loved drawing circles.  These execs.  The radius of the signal.  They sit at night down, right?  It's a map of the Boston area.  He goes, currently, A.F. reaches this amount of people.  And he draws a circle that is just on the outskirts of Boston itself, but in all the fields where 
[00:19:30]  there's not a lot of people living.  We came in crystal clear.  This is our current circle, boys.  But next year, with the big stick, this is going to be the new circle.  And then he draws a big circle.  It overlaps the other circle.  Did the new big stick come?  No.  Oh, and we've been gone 11 years, and they're still waiting.  If you don't think this business is full of shit, full of shitholes. 
[00:20:00]  They're all full of shit.  Call them shitholes.  33 colleges in the Boston area.  That's it.  And what?  Each college, what?  A couple hundred students, right?  Yeah.  No big deal.  Yeah.  Elton John, tribute to Michael Jackson.  Let me see what this is about.  Tim in South Carolina.  Tim.  Pedophile rock.  Pedophile rock.  That's funny.  Cogged out rock.  Yeah, we did. 
[00:20:30]  Holy shit.  He was a stewardess.  Stewardess.  I'm going to stewardess.  You guys want to?  Not in a dog, Alice.  You want to hear what Artie Cornfield had to say about?  Cornfield.  About Woodstock.  Yeah, let's listen to fucking Artie Cornfield.  Yeah.  By the way, everyone is bitching that we need to WD-40 that fucking door.  I don't notice it during the replay, but they say every time a staff member comes in,  you hear that door. 
[00:21:00]  That's kind of cool.  That way people know what's going on.  Yeah, you know people are coming in for their beating.  Coming and going.  Has anyone seen E-Rock today?  He's still unhappy.  Is he really sad?  He's hanging very low today.  He's not sad.  He's very mad and angry and frustrated.  Well, because he feels as though he was humiliated yesterday because he was brought into the  studio for the sole purpose of sitting down and allowing listeners to call in and call  him fat.  Well, he was.  That's stupid.  We just all need a vacation.  Yeah.  Eric is definitely... 
[00:21:30]  Should we bring Eric in here and make it up to him?  No.  I wouldn't push it.  Very upset.  He is very upset.  I don't want to see E-Rock upset.  I do.  He's ornery.  Maybe one of the listeners could call up and say something nice to him.  Yeah, compliment E-Rock, okay?  That's what it is.  All right, after the Artie Cornfield.  First of all, it's Cornfowl.  He's one of the fathers.  Well, he's the father of Woodstock.  What about his partner?  Yeah.  The guy with the...  He's a co-creator slash father of Woodstock. 
[00:22:00]  So he's co-creator, but he's the sole father.  Did he acknowledge the other guy?  Yes.  Well, there's four people who created it, but he said the first two, it was just money  for them.  They didn't really have much to do with it.  It was just him and the other guy.  Hey, there's a guy that works for AF that wants to defend.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, guys.  AF, that's a good station, and we did get a second tower.  We have a tower in Brockton now, so we cover Boston.  You have a tower in Brockton?  Yep.  That's where...  Yeah, we certainly cover Boston, Rhode Island, Connecticut. 
[00:22:30]  They're a great station.  Yeah, but there is one problem.  What's that?  You still have Hill, man.  Oh, come on.  He's a good egg.  Awkward.  Awkward for Matt.  Good egg, huh?  He's a good guy, but you know what?  When I listen to a radio station, I don't care if the guy's a good guy.  I want to hear cool stuff.  He's a bore.  LB's all right, though.  He's good. 
[00:23:00]  He's a good guy.  I think he's funny.  He's not a funny issue, I'll admit, but I think he's good.  We weren't even going for that compliment.  He just sucks, to be completely honest with you.  Well, I was going for a compliment.  He's just a local guy that is just surviving year after year.  But thank you, Matt.  You've got two towers now.  That's cool.  Good for you guys.  We're very pleased.  Say hi to the guys that secretly still like us over there at AF.  The guy.  You know, you've got to whisper to them.  There's a couple of them.  All right, cool.  Thanks, Matt.  Is Rocky, what was his name?  Rocco.  Dennis.  Oh, fucking no. 
[00:23:30]  Thank you, Dennis.  He's a big radio personality.  W-Y-U-K.  He works for us.  That's yuck.  I get it.  Let's over-explain everything today.  Like that caller.  Happy to do that.  All right, what's up with the Kornfield guy, then?  First of all, his name is Artie Kornfeld, and he's the father of Woodstock.  Probably the biggest concert of all time.  All right, let's see what he says here.  All right, so we're here with Artie Kornfeld, one of the creators of Woodstock.  Yes, ma'am.  What's the haps? 
[00:24:00]  What's the haps?  The haps is you have a dream, and you make it happen.  And I've been doing...  I was doing...  You pause this.  Oh, this is going to be fun.  Oh, jeez.  I hate this already.  Why?  Aged hippie.  I don't hate him.  I just...  The whole inspirational message.  This is going to bug me.  What was his dream?  Exactly.  Like, I have weird dreams.  I would never try to actually make them happen.  You have a dream.  I mean...  You make it happen.  What?  I'm getting chased by some monster thing, and I can't run fast because my feet are like 
[00:24:30]  stuck to the ground.  That's not something I want to come true.  I dreamt there was a million long hair shitting in my lawn.  Next thing you know, I'm not talking about that kind of dream.  I was in prison.  No.  Up on murder charges.  Right.  You want that dream to come true?  Frightening.  Woke up, and I was like, thank God I was asleep.  He means like waking dreams.  Like dreams you have.  I dream...  Daydreams.  No.  No.  Like...  Oh.  One day I could do this.  I dream that I could...  Not like...  But no one dreams that shit.  You think that shit. 
[00:25:00]  That's different than a dream.  A dream is like Ant was describing.  And then you grab your pink elephant and fly away.  Like stuff that doesn't make sense.  Are you saying secret hopes or aspirations?  Yeah.  He's thinking longingly towards.  All right.  But I think we overused the term, you know, I dreamt this and now it's a reality type of  stuff.  What was your dream?  You do something and 40 years later you still don't make a nickel off of it?  Fucking rotten businessman.  Worst businessman ever.  Terrible.  I nominate Artie Kornfield.  And the other guy's probably made 400 million. 
[00:25:30]  Secretly.  Still lives in his shack, so Artie Kornfield is not on to him.  Yeah.  Still keeping it from him.  Fucking Artie sucks.  You guys are way off base, I think.  He sucks a hippie dick.  Oh, come on.  Listen to him.  It's all hippie talk.  And I've been doing...  I was doing it musically.  I mean, I do have 120 platinum albums as a writer, producer, and promoter, and manager.  So that's my life music.  And Woodstock is an extension. 
[00:26:00]  Stopping a war.  Getting rid of a bad president.  Sound familiar now?  Let it go.  He stopped...  Oh, my God.  We have Artie Kornfield to thank for the stopping of a war?  I don't think he's taking full credit.  He's just saying that that was one of the messages of Woodstock.  Okay, Artie...  And he goes, sound familiar?  Like, see, it's still happening.  Yeah.  And we need this kind of...  Shut it.  Oh, Bush, I got it.  Clam up.  Artie Kornfield is just bugging me.  He's Kornfield.  And he's just trying to say it. 
[00:26:30]  The more things change, the more they stay the same.  Was he?  Yeah.  Oh, really?  That's very obvious.  Yeah.  Tell Artie Kornfield to try to get another Woodstock going and see him get beat over the head  by state troopers.  Tell fucking Artie Korncob to shut his face.  We're all tired of him.  His name is Artie Kornfield.  I've only heard of God.  Stop wearing that shitty flea market shirt.  Make a few million.  Really?  What does Cho not say?  What does he collect cans to pay his bills?  Is zero?  Has other business ventures. 
[00:27:00]  Does he really?  He's making shit up as he goes long.  I've got 432,000 platinum records.  I've got 10 million listeners.  No, you don't.  No, they don't.  You don't even have a dime to show from Woodstock.  He chose not to make any money off Woodstock.  No one chooses that shit.  It's here a more Artie Kornhusk.  You sound familiar now?  So that's why I'm doing the West Fest 40th for free in October.  So you're another fucking venture that he doesn't make money.  It's for the people.  This guy doesn't learn.  Wait, what's he doing? 
[00:27:30]  40th something.  It's called 40th West.  They don't even call it the 40th anniversary of Woodstock?  No, because he doesn't want to do another Woodstock.  So what?  He's so commercialized, man.  Plus, he probably doesn't own.  He doesn't own the name Woodstock.  But he's a father.  He named it.  He doesn't own that name.  All he had to do was copyright the word Woodstock.  He would be almost a billionaire today.  That's against the message.  Oh, really?  To copyright it. 
[00:28:00]  Really?  How about fucking the fact that Bonnaroo does what Woodstock did in Bonnaroo?  He couldn't compete with Bonnaroo right now.  Well, he calls it some weird thing.  West.  Getting rid of a bad president.  Sound familiar now?  No.  That's what I'm doing.  West Fest 40th for free.  West Fest.  In October.  So you're one of the four guys who kind of created it, but you're known it.  Actually, Michael Lang and I created it one night.  The other two guys put up $250,000.  I raised a million and a half during it to keep it going.  Wow.  Yeah, but with one ad.  Because I knew radio. 
[00:28:30]  And it was the first time radio was, because I had so many songs on radio.  And I sang in front of 20,000 people, so I know what it's like.  Right.  How about you?  No.  The people put on Woodstock.  I just told them through radio and through the right advertising to come in peace and  to be ready for something special, and they believed it.  He's full of shit.  They didn't know anything back then.  I've been reading up on Woodstock a little bit, right?  And they said that radio wasn't a big part of Woodstock, especially the New York radio 
[00:29:00]  stations.  Maybe the tiny local stations in the area of Bethel and Woodstock, New York, but not  New York City.  New York City radio, like, it was just barely mentioned.  You're probably reading things by the imitators, not the actual father of Woodstock, Artie Kornfeld.  Oh.  Artie Kornfeld sucks.  It's Kornfeld.  Tell Artie Cream Corn we don't want to hear a shit from him anymore.  It's Kornfeld.  We're all tired of him.  Artie Korn in my shit bugs me. 
[00:29:30]  Artie Kornhole.  It's Kornhole.  Stupid Artie.  He's a good guy.  No, he's not.  He said he liked my hair.  Of course he did.  Yeah.  Right.  Artie talks about knowing that Woodstock would be more than just a concert and not being able  to repeat it.  No one knew.  Artie did.  How did Artie know?  Artie didn't know shit.  Yeah.  If he knew, he would have prepared better.  He wrote Little Ol' Artie from Pasadena.  That's wonderful for Artie.  That fucking, I respect the fucking Unabomber's writing more than that fucking song. 
[00:30:00]  That song is terrible.  I like it.  He knew, really?  That's why ten port-a-potties?  Exactly.  And no food for a half a million people?  Yeah.  Really?  It's not about the port-a-poties.  He knew, right?  It wasn't about the port-a-poties.  A tiny little stage, like, I think our stage for the Traveling Virus show was bigger.  Well, I mean, you know, it's the future.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Did you know when you guys were putting it on that it was going to be something different  from a music festival?  Did you have any idea how impactful?  Watch, watch, watch, watch. 
[00:30:30]  Of course he did.  Of course he did.  That's why they did it.  Yeah, yeah.  And yet, festivals at that time, they had, you know, Altamont, they did one, Watkins Glen.  And, um, but, uh, this, he just knew, before, uh, history and hindsight, he knew this was  going to be, like, the biggest fucking thing.  Guaranteed, that's what he said.  He knew it was going to be special.  He'll say the words, if he says the word special, I'm punching Stan in the stomach.  Oh, no.  Stan?  Stan, yeah.  Not Stan, because I like Stan. 
[00:31:00]  Thank goodness.  Stan.  Stan.  And I have an M-song.  I'm going to punch it in the stomach.  That stupid Stan.  Get a hold of yourself.  Egg in my mouth.  I send extra tea.  I get nervous.  And then you had some on your face.  Oh, no.  I sure did.  Oh.  Get it?  Bite a humble pie, please.  All right.  Radiohead's calling it quits.  30 days in the hole.  Radiohead's calling it quits.  Bum, bum, bum, bum.  What?  That's what I just read.  Radiohead calling it quits.  Done.  What?  Yeah.  That's it.  Speaking of, uh, speaking of, uh, everything cool going away. 
[00:31:30]  What?  That's it.  No.  That's it.  No.  Uh, Tom York, he probably just wants to do his own thing.  But he does his own thing, basically.  The band probably didn't have Artie Kornfeld promoting them properly.  Enough with Artie.  Let's see.  Uh, Ray, we're recording.  Uh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Uh, Tom York said, uh, recording another album would kill the band because making records  has become a real drag to them. 
[00:32:00]  So what, are they just going to, um, tour?  Are they still touring as a band?  But they're not making any new songs or recording albums.  Maybe they'll make new songs but never record them on an album.  Is that it?  That's sort of, oh, okay.  That's the way, uh, Pearl Jam went years ago, right, Travis?  What?  Didn't Pearl Jam kind of give up on, um...  No, they have a new album coming out next month.  Oh, there you go.  Then I'm wrong about that one.  They certainly are.  But they, but they stopped pretty much going and making albums on a regular basis, no? 
[00:32:30]  Well, they stopped caring about the commercial aspect of it.  I guess that's what I'm sort of getting at.  You could just say they stopped caring.  No, they're fantastic.  Yeah, well, they got a Grateful Dead thing going.  No, they certainly do.  They're the Artie Kornfeld of Grand Drive.  And the reason why Artie Kornfeld, because the festivals were already starting, wasn't, uh,  Watkins, Glenn was before, what's that?  Was it?  I'm not sure what the year was, but it was all around that scene.  I don't think Woodstock was the first one.  No.  It was the biggest one. 
[00:33:00]  For sure.  Half a million strong.  Thank you, Artie.  Even though it was only 400,000.  Yeah.  They were a little off with their math.  Next phone.  Because by leaving Capitol Records, I was only 24 and a half years old.  I would have been the president of Capitol Records by the time I was 26.  Really?  What?  Well, I mean...  Then why would you leave?  You'd have a lot more influence if you were there.  You could have got a lot more done.  What the fuck were you thinking?  What an idiot.  He's not an idiot.  It's because he's an idiot.  He created Woodstock. 
[00:33:30]  He didn't.  He was 24 and a half.  He could have been by the time he was 26 or 27.  26.  A year and a half.  So he left a year and a half before he was the president of Capitol.  Why would you do that?  Artie's a bit full of himself.  He fucking needs enough with him already.  Really is.  By the time I was 26.  And I still had three and a half years on my contract.  And I was happening with the band and the games people play and the Stone Ponies.  I had a lot going on at Capitol.  And I knew the night we thought of it, I knew.  I immediately thought this has to be a record in the movie, which my other part is I had 
[00:34:00]  no idea because they weren't from the business.  You know?  I mean, and I always knew if this could happen and it would happen.  The first night when we came up with it, my wife said, I'll bet you'd be there half a million people.  And why do you think it's never been able to, anything like that has been able to be repeated?  Well, how do you, how do you, how, how do you create a miracle?  You think if Jimmy got on stage right now, he would play the same exact version of the  Star Spangled Banner?  No way.  You know? 
[00:34:30]  So it's like, no, miracles can't be, you know, it was ridiculous for my ex-partners to even  try a two and three.  You know, that was for commercial reasons.  You know?  People that are trying to make money off Woodstock are going to fail.  I've never made a penny off Woodstock.  I've never tried.  And you failed.  No, he, what's the miracle about it?  I mean, it was a good festival.  Yeah.  It was a very successful musical event.  Where's the miracle?  God, that's a lot of fucking people.  Oh, yeah.  It's, I mean. 
[00:35:00]  It's a miraculous amount.  It was just a word, it's just a word of mouth thing.  This guy hasn't done shit since.  Wow.  He's waiting for the word of mouth thing to come back.  He's got a radio show with 10 million listeners.  And, uh, Droopy.  You told me.  Droopy's a little confused, Sam.  Maybe you can help him out.  Droopy.  Sure.  Now, is this Artie Kornheiser for Monday Night Football?  No.  Oh, no.  Oh, wow.  He went on to Monday Night Football?  No.  No, this is, see, he had a second career.  It's Artie Kornfeld.  I don't care what Artie Kornlang says. 
[00:35:30]  I don't want to listen to this guy.  No.  He hasn't made a penny.  He's a fool.  It's Kornfeld.  He has made an impact, regardless of how much money he's made.  Did anyone do cream of corn yet?  Yes.  I did.  Jimmy did cream corn.  Yes.  I did corn on my shit.  Yes.  I did Kornhole, though.  Artie Kornball.  It's Kornball.  I have another not cool, though, bummed out.  Yeah.  Fucking the law.  You mentioned Ozzy.  The lawsuit.  Ozzy suing... 
[00:36:00]  Black Sabbath.  Tony.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He's probably right to see him, too, if he's not getting any...  Yeah.  Tony's kind of being greedy with the Sabbath...  Do you think Sharon Osbourne is more famous than Ozzy?  No.  Not at all.  No.  Why?  She's just not.  I mean, he's on...  She's on the biggest TV show in America.  She's huge, but she's not more famous than...  Merger's got talented 12 million viewers last week.  No, not more famous than Ozzy.  Ozzy's been famous since 1970.  He's been a fucking rock star for over four years.  Ozzy and Sharon walk down the streets of New York City.  Who gets more recognized? 
[00:36:30]  Ozzy.  Without a doubt.  I'm not saying that because I love Ozzy.  It's not mainstream, though.  It's pretty powerful.  Yeah.  I'm not saying it's a cool recognition, but I think more people know Sharon Osbourne now.  It's just something I was thinking about yesterday.  Is it open for debate or not?  Ozzy in the rock world, of course, wins every time.  Ozzy walks around in a few different countries, and then Sharon walks around in a few different countries.  Well, it's over America.  Ozzy's getting recognized.  Cities, then.  Have Ozzy walk around in American cities. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  And then have Sharon walk around in American cities, separate from each other.  Ozzy's getting recognized more.  Why, though?  Guaranteed.  Why?  Because he's just more famous.  Mainstream famous?  He's more mainstream famous, yeah.  His name is more famous.  You know, he just is.  And it's not even being biased.  What else does Artie Corn Oil have to say?  First of all, did we do cornbread yet?  Not yet.  Some of that Artie Cornbread your wife made.  His last name is Kornfeld. 
[00:37:30]  Oh.  Oh.  By the way, there's a show coming out at A&E called Hoarders.  I can't wait to see it.  Oh, I know.  Could someone highlight that article?  Please.  I was laughing openly.  This lady, she's a hoarder to the point she can't use her own sink anymore.  Oh, that show.  But she wants to use her sink.  It's like, all right, then throw some shit out.  Fill it up and drown yourself in it.  Exactly.  Throw some stuff out, fat lady.  Put your head in there.  Ugh.  Another attention-seeking person.  Do you think she needs attention? 
[00:38:00]  I'm a hoarder.  Do you think that she just wants people to come over and nurture her?  And say, why does she do this?  She has a problem.  I'm a hoarder.  I want to do this.  I want to clean my house.  I want to.  So do it.  Just do it.  Is right.  God.  Would you like to throw her shit out?  Oh, I would like to just burn the house with her in it.  I have to save every newspaper or something bad will happen.  They drive around.  Ooh, that looks good.  Let me grab that and bring it home.  It's flea infested.  Yeah.  Fucking old TV stand. 
[00:38:30]  Jesus.  How's your TV, Sam?  I think I read a Twitter that your standard definition cathode ray tube television is finally  give up the ghost.  Every 45 to 50 seconds, you've got to smack the sides because the black starts jumping  up.  But once you smack it, it's not appropriate, Sam.  That was a problem back in the 1800s.  No, come on.  That's not what I was talking about.  It still isn't in the movie theaters.  You know it's not right to slap blacks in the year 2009.  I wasn't talking about that.  Oh, Jesus.  I meant the picture.  The black jumps up and down.  That's very inappropriate. 
[00:39:00]  What's wrong?  I shouldn't be doing interviews over there then, Sam.  I know.  Come on.  That's not what I was talking about here.  Speaking of which, let's get back to Artie Cornrow and see what he has.  When you were doing what's that, did you think that it would be, people would still be talking  about it this long after?  Like 40 years.  Yeah, once.  No.  The only signature.  No fucking way.  I don't like this guy.  40 years.  Yes, he did.  That's why he did it.  Really?  Yeah.  This guy is full of himself. 
[00:39:30]  There's one other event from 1969 that people talk about, and that's landing on the moon.  I think that had a little more, you know, oomph than a concert.  Either he's lying or he could have been in for a major disappointment if this thing didn't  go well.  Yeah, yeah.  He could have really been let down, right?  I think people are going to be talking about this for 40 years.  40 years later, people are still going to be babbling about Woodstock.  By the way, Watkins Glen, just so we have the info out there, four years after Woodstock. 
[00:40:00]  Okay.  And that was quite successful.  That was successful.  How many people at the Watkins Glen show?  I think 30 million.  What about Altamont Speedway?  Yeah.  What about Stones?  What year was that?  Monterey Pop Festival.  Monterey Pop Festival.  What is that?  Is that a hippie chick coming out of the fucking weeds?  Nice.  From Woodstock?  Look at that big fucking muff.  Look at that.  And look at those, look at that voluptuous body. 
[00:40:30]  Nice breasts.  Why would you grow an area where the ticks could hang out?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  You know what kind of ticks and nits?  If you were going to be a naked hippie, wouldn't you just shave everything off?  How many chiggers are in there from the field?  You ever see those things?  I'm going to, I have another bet.  Peas.  Watkins Glen.  Here are armpits.  Rock lineup?  Yeah.  Better than Woodstock.  And I don't know anything about the Watkins Glen show.  That's crazy.  Well, let's find that out.  Could you tell me who played Watkins Glen? 
[00:41:00]  There's nothing better than Woodstock.  Well, Joe in Texas is very confused, Sam, with your interview with the...  Morning, fellas.  Hey.  Is this that one song you should talk about on Views and Butthead, the great Cornholio?  Oh, this is the greatest Cornholio?  It's not Cornholio.  No, it's Korn, it's Kornfeld.  Artie Kornholio.  Artie Kornholio.  Artie Kornholio.  Are you threatening me?  We need Teepee for our festival. 
[00:41:30]  Let's hear what Artie Kornholio has to say.  What is he saying?  This guy is full of himself.  I'm the only signature on that movie deal.  It was just me and Freddie Warren.  Of course it was.  It was handwritten.  It took 35 hours of fighting to write, to give Wadley money to shoot it.  Once I signed that signature, I already knew 300,000 were coming, because I already sold  100,000 tickets.  So how did you know three...  Wait, if you sold 100,000 tickets, how did you know 300? 
[00:42:00]  What do you mean you already sold 100,000 tickets?  Yeah.  Rules of three.  What?  Look, Artie Kornholio, I don't care.  Look, it's not his name.  It's Fred from Brooklyn.  That's a good one.  You better off to pass that one away.  I kind of like it.  I like that one.  I've written a million and a half myself with an advertisement, you know?  And I knew, once the movie deal was signed, that this would be history.  I always felt if Monterey would have been filmed properly, it would have been history 
[00:42:30]  too, you know?  But all of a sudden, Woodstock...  Okay, look, Woodstock wasn't filmed properly.  It's very confusing to watch.  It sucks.  With the split screen and all that shit.  And so much shit was missed.  Right.  Was it?  Yes.  Yeah.  What were you saying the other day?  What performance they don't even have on...  I know, there's plenty of them that they never even had yet.  Don't even know they were there because they're not in the film at all.  They weren't filmed.  But all of a sudden, Woodstock, Time Magazine, the two greatest events of mankind are the  moon landing in Woodstock. 
[00:43:00]  Thanks.  I mean, you know, that's...  That's not me.  That rules.  Really?  They're both fucking...  What?  They're both eight months apart?  Best of two in history?  That's it.  In history.  Fuck, you know, VE Day.  VJ Day.  Dropping of the atomic bombs.  Things like that as far as history goes.  It's third, fourth.  Third, fourth, you think?  Probably.  Yeah.  It's the Woodstock Nation.  It's the spirit of Woodstock.  Wait, can we figure out a couple of days that were better in human history?  Of course we can.  I'm going to vote the first time some humanoid-type creature wiped his ass and threw the paper 
[00:43:30]  in a hole instead of using a stick that he also ate with.  Yeah, that probably...  That's a good one.  A lot bigger.  It was the first time that somebody decided to dispose of the paper they wiped their ass  with.  That's the best day in human history.  Yeah.  Well, first they had to actually wipe their ass.  Yeah.  They're just scooting it against the gravel.  Ugh. 
[00:44:00]  So, John Filly in 69, that was the Sharon Tate murders, too, right?  Oh.  Was that the year of Madison?  Pretty big story.  That was a biggie.  I don't like Woodstock, though.  They're coming to Woodstock.  Oh, sorry, sir.  We got Jimmy in Delaware.  Jimmy?  What's up?  Hey, what's happening, guys?  Hey.  First of all, Sam, very sexy.  I love you.  Oh, thank you very much.  Hey, you're welcome.  I was curious if Artie Corey Feldman mentioned Michael Jackson at all.  Corey Feldman?  That doesn't even make sense, sir.  It's Kornfeld.  Not Kornfeld.  Corey Feldman. 
[00:44:30]  Kornfeld.  Watch how this comes all the way around.  Sean, go ahead.  Hey, boys.  I'm surprised E-Rock didn't interview Artie Kornmuffin.  Moo.  Moo.  Very cruel.  All right.  Let's get back to this.  It's the spirit of Woodstock.  It's the people that could hold the light.  So my whole trip is hold the light, bringing younger people into the Woodstock nation.  And it's happening.  Is it?  Yep.  Hold the light. 
[00:45:00]  Man.  Memories are a weird thing.  Why do you say that?  Because he's got to make it bigger than it really was.  There's just a bunch of people that wanted to hang out for a long weekend, hear some good  tunes, smoke some dope.  It was one of the two biggest things that ever happened in the world.  Yeah, ever.  In the mystery of ever.  The moon landing was probably a little bigger.  But other than that.  Well, he said the moon landing and Woodstock.  Maybe tied.  Stop trying to make it.  How about the crucifixion of Christ?  It was a little bigger.  Fucking arrogant idiot.  Really?  Really? 
[00:45:30]  The fall of the Roman Empire.  That's kind of huge.  It was a little big.  How about the building of the fucking Sphinx with the pyramids?  Those were slightly bigger.  How about the assassination of JFK?  Yeah.  That was a little bit bigger than Woodstock.  A little more history impacting.  Yeah.  How about the assassination of Lincoln?  You want to keep going?  Yeah.  James J. from Long Island wants us to get back to the interview with Artie and the Children  of the Corn.  So let's talk.  Right.  We're almost done here.  That's not his name.  Cornfout.  Coming from the corporate world of music, before this, were there some of your peers 
[00:46:00]  that thought you were crazy for leaving and doing something like that?  You know what?  I was turned with Sonny and Cher playing for 20,000 people a night long before Woodstock.  And I had already written 57 chart songs before I ever did Woodstock.  I already ran three companies.  I mean, I signed Wild Thing.  I signed Walk Away Renee.  So that wasn't corporate world.  I was the first director of rock in the history of the business.  FM radio was just happening.  So they hired me to be the connection to the longhairs. 
[00:46:30]  Did they?  And I was.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Long hair in a suit.  Wow.  Look at that.  A nice Colombian.  Wow, man.  Yeah.  The guy was, he was corporate.  No, no, no.  He was a self-centered douche.  For the late 60s, that was being corporate.  Long hair in a suit, man.  Whoa.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Wow.  Oh.  It's a little tricky.  Artie Cornstarch is an asshole.  I've had enough of him, haven't you? 
[00:47:00]  Stand up.  Kornfeld is his name, and he accomplished a lot.  Yeah.  He could have been the president of Columbia Records at 26, but gave it all up to make Woodstock  happen.  Yeah.  Why couldn't he do both?  Well, let's.  Yeah, come on.  It's busy.  Is there any more of Artie Cornia?  Oh, sorry.  Yeah, one more clip from Artie Feldman.  I want more fucking Feldman.  Anyone?  Anyone?  Dealer?  Anyone?  What's that?  It's Kornfeld.  Yeah, I'm throwing my hot coffee at you when this is done. 
[00:47:30]  Why?  For this Artie Cornucopia interview, nobody gives a shit.  I got the exclusive on this.  If this doesn't prove you should kill yourself for the show, I don't know what else to tell  you.  I got an exclusive interview.  Yeah, you sucked.  This sucked.  That's two exclusive interviews in one week.  All right, shut up, and let's just hear Artie Cornflakes.  How do we miss that?  Cornflakes?  Are you kidding me?  Jesus.  What the fuck?  That's Feld.  Did we do Candy Corn?  No.  For the Halloweeners out there?  For the Halloweeners.  Halloweeners. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, God.  Let's get this stupid thing over with.  He doesn't know what to say.  Sam asked Artie about lawyers and government.  Oh, wow.  This is going to be disappointing.  This is good.  Stopping another Woodstock moment from happening.  That's a good question.  Do you think that the amount of restrictions that people have now, whether it comes to lawyers  and content or government making up permits for everything and performers and all this,  is kind of stopping us from having another Woodstock moment? 
[00:48:30]  I actually think that Woodstock Ventures hurt really bad by stopping people from doing concerts.  Because Woodstock should not be a name that's trademarked.  You know, I could see the logo being trademarked.  I could see the name, the Woodstock music and art fair.  Because I used to own it.  But Michael and I walked.  Michael went back in to do Woodstock, too.  And I was very opposed to him doing that.  How could you have Pepsi-Cola and a record company sponsor a Woodstock?  That's everything Woodstock was against.  Well, they did.  So the commercialism and the trading, it actually gets me sick. 
[00:49:00]  Because you weren't a part of it.  Yeah.  Because they cut you the fuck out.  If you had a piece of the action, you wouldn't be sick.  He said himself, he placed himself out.  He was not cut out.  Of course.  Of course.  Even, like, half the people that were there ended up moving into the corporate world.  And what's wrong with...  You're not still wandering around like hippies.  The world changed.  Yeah.  What's wrong with Pepsi?  It's a beverage.  Yeah.  It's not a fucking...  Can't be part of it, man. 
[00:49:30]  It's not child poison.  Yeah.  I've never seen a Pepsi-produced atomic bomb or anything like GE or something.  It's not a liquid, like, lead drink for children.  It's a fucking beverage they'll all enjoy.  Ah, Jesus.  When is the 40th anniversary?  Tomorrow?  I guess so.  What are you doing for the 40th anniversary?  Yeah.  Exactly.  I don't know.  I mean, I'll probably listen to my Artie Kornfeld interview complete.  Ah, ah, and its entirety.  I got, like, 13 minutes.  This is just a taste.  Wow. 
[00:50:00]  Thank God, that's all.  A little taste of Kornfeld.  A little niblet.  Yeah.  It's just a little...  Because it's a kernel.  Yeah, it's a kernel of the interview we're getting here.  Corn syrup coming in a lot.  Ah, Artie Cornstarch.  We do that one?  Yes.  We do Artie Cornstarch?  Yeah, I think.  Yeah, yeah.  He's probably picked on growing up with some of these names.  Artie Unicorn, Artie Popcorn, Artie Peppercorn, Artie Cornflower, Artie Corn Cake, Artie Cornmeal, Artie Ethanol.  Artie Ethanol.  Artie Baby Corn, and the Indians call him Artie Mays. 
[00:50:30]  Feld.  Mays Feld.  Man.  Just cornfeld.  And he did a lot, and he's someone that should be honored.  Yeah.  I think he's full of shit myself.  I think he's so full of shit.  Shite.  I have another copy of that CD, just so you know, Danny.  Danny threw it in the garbage.  It's not a big deal.  His interview went in the garbage.  I got another copy.  Yeah?  That's right.  Very good, Sam.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Yeah, another fine job, Sam Roberts. 
[00:51:00]  Uh, Sam should count how many times Artie says what?  Oh, we lost him anyway.  It doesn't matter.  All right, why don't we move on to something else here?  Debbie on Long Island.  Debbie.  Hey, Debbie.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thanks, Deb.  I have two things out of here.  Thank you.  Thank you, old dear friends.  For what?  For coming to my birthday!  She's just talking over it.  That's not right.  Do you hear the...  Porn movie theaters.  Do you hear the sound clip?  Go, Deb. 
[00:51:30]  I have two cool things.  What?  Porn movie theaters, because what's going on there in Bayshore soon?  I guess she's trying to get a Jimmy plug in.  I didn't even get that.  Because she said Bayshore, and there's no other reason to even mention Bayshore.  Are you still coming down from your Woodstock trip?  Yeah.  Stay tight in Woodstock, because...  Than the fact that Jimmy Norton will be in Bayshore.  I swear to God, it's my gig, and I didn't know what she was doing. 
[00:52:00]  I'm not plugging that fucking stupid October 2nd gig.  Tickets on sale Friday?  Who gives a shit?  We're talking about something.  Here I am.  BoltonCenter.org.  B-O-U-L-T.  B-O-U-L-T.  It's not about that.  What the fuck are you doing?  Two shows Friday, October 2nd.  Who cares?  It's a small, intimate venue.  Right.  Venue.  Doesn't matter at all.  Of course it doesn't.  Don't even bring it up, as a matter of fact.  Not even a little bit.  Yeah.  Yeah, Friday on sale.  Go ahead.  Buy them if you want.  What am I going to do?  Mention it?  No.  She's trying to do the... 
[00:52:30]  And I think it should be a theme today.  Cool things that go away.  Or are going away.  And Debbie had one.  Debbie what?  What was the other one besides the porn theater?  The other one is no more tailgating in the new giant stadium.  They're not going to allow tailgating except for one lot.  Are you fucking kidding me?  They're setting aside one lot?  Are you fucking kidding me?  Isn't that amazing?  Only one area is going to be...  Why do they have to ruin everything?  Yeah.  What is the point of that? 
[00:53:00]  I don't get it.  For real.  I need a sports fan to explain why they're taking tailgating away.  Probably because of the lawsuit with the drunk people and people dying.  Nope.  No?  Well...  They don't want drunk people, so they set it aside.  They can patrol the one lot.  Make sure people aren't getting intoxicated.  I think...  You think they ruin everything?  They do, right?  Dude, they ruin everything.  I mean, it's depressing to be born when we were and see what has gone on. 
[00:53:30]  It's unbelievable what...  Because the kids today, they're 18, whatever.  They don't know any better, so they're just like...  This is their life, so they just go with it and deal with it.  They have no idea how cool it used to be.  Man!  But I'm not trying to do a man thing.  I mean, tailgating...  But it does sound...  You know something about it?  It does sound like that.  It does sound like that, sure.  It's the same thing like your old man would say stuff like that.  You don't even understand.  We were driving...  Oh, we used to go cruising down the boulevard. 
[00:54:00]  What a boring Saturday.  Oh, I know.  Stupid leather jacket arm out the window.  Driving around in circles around some fucking diner.  Watch some fucking greasy-haired asshole named Ducky eat a fucking burger hanging out his window.  Shut up!  That was fun.  Exactly.  Some fucking cock-tease in his skirt.  You dump one load, or are you going to marry her?  Exactly.  That sperm was lethal back then.  Oh, my God.  One lousy load?  What the fuck?  Every chick got pregnant the second you stuck your dick in him. 
[00:54:30]  I guess you're right.  I guess if we acknowledge that we are doing what our dads used to do to us.  But they're...  I mean...  Dude, sporting events without tailgating.  And it's not the drunk driving thing.  I'm telling you.  Really?  They don't care if they lose one or two every year.  They really don't.  About the lawsuits.  Know what they see?  What?  All those people getting drunk before the game, drinking less, and spending less money in the stadium.  Because when you're tailgating, you're feeding yourself.  That's true.  You're having beers. 
[00:55:00]  You're all set for the game.  And now you will spend less at the actual game.  Well, that's not fair.  I guarantee that is the number one reason why they're taking tailgating away.  Because some marketing douchebag said, look, we get rid of tailgating, these people will  spend more at the stadium.  More at the stadium.  I'm just telling you, that's what it is.  And I bet you they charge more for the fucking tailgating lot.  And they do.  A lot more.  Yeah.  A lot more?  Wow.  Mother...  Fuck!  Artie takes a big cooler of corn with him to the tailgating.  Makes fresh popcorn for everyone.  It's great. 
[00:55:30]  It's Woodstock Nation.  You can't take tailgating away.  You're right.  That's what it is.  You can't take tailgating away from sporting events.  Sometimes it's the best part of the sporting event.  It really is.  You spend a whole afternoon leading up to the game, hanging out, meeting people, hanging  with your friends and family, the little ones, teaching them the ways of tailgating  and whatnot.  Of drinking.  Drinking.  Drinking.  Whatever.  Sure.  Whatever.  I want to call.  Yeah.  No, you got to show him.  You put that in your Bob-Op.  It makes you sleep good. 
[00:56:00]  Oh, see?  Thank you, Debbie.  Who's your favorite player?  I think my theory's being backed up here.  Bob in Indiana.  Bob.  Hey there, Bab.  Hey.  Nope.  You just screwed my whole point up, but you're right.  They want the extra coin.  That's all they care about.  They don't care about what the fans want to do outside.  They don't care a damn bit about all that.  All it is is that $10 beer and $8 hot dog.  That's all they give a damn about.  You're right.  How much money does the man need from us? 
[00:56:30]  For real.  Well, you're paying an overrated quarterback like Eli that much money, more than his brother  who's maybe the one of the best that's ever lived.  You got to do something to pay that crazy salary.  It's ridiculous.  That's why I think new sports like MMA, some of these other sports have a real chance if  they do it right.  Yeah.  Because they still appreciate the fan.  They're not trying to basically rape him for every dollar he has in his pocket when he 
[00:57:00]  goes into the event.  That'll come later.  I know.  With more popularity.  You're right.  Hopefully they'll learn.  You know, because the old school sports, they're raping us at this point.  How much does it take to go to a Met game at Citi Field?  Because I still want to go there.  It ranges.  Hello.  Yes, Bob.  Can I say one more thing?  Yep.  Hey, Jimmy, come to Indiana sometime so we can stay here.  I will actually.  Thank you.  That would be a great market for you.  Yeah, I've never been there.  Indiana would be strong.  Thanks, Bob.  Yeah, how much to see the Mets just fucking lose game after game. 
[00:57:30]  The Metropolitans.  The Metropolitans.  Yeah, how much to see the Mets.  I'll bring up.  They're having just a horrendous run.  They are.  I don't even watch.  So fucking bad.  Are they terrible?  Horrendous.  Horrid.  Half the team is injured.  Yeah, yeah.  They're just having a horrible year with injuries.  But the Yankees are cranking.  Ever since Kate Hudson stuck her tongue down fucking A-Rod's throat.  That's what happens.  I don't know if John Sterling had any good calls yesterday. 
[00:58:00]  Oh, boy.  Let me tell you.  We'll lead to that.  Anthony made sure the boys pulled a doozy.  A couple of doozies.  Talk about douche chill.  It's the definition of douche chill.  Yeah.  Well, as far as Mets tickets go, I just looked for the Friday game at Citi Field.  Sure.  They range in price from $23 all the way up to, if you'd like the best seats in the house, $595.  For one ticket?  One ticket. 
[00:58:30]  $600 for a ticket to a baseball game.  But that's Delta Club Platinum.  And what does that get you?  What do you get for $600?  By the way, that $600 is not $600.  You pay for the parking.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, yeah.  That's why the $23 ticket is a joke.  That gets you a seat.  I mean, those are basically the seats right behind.  That's the one where you wave behind home plate.  Oh, really?  And you're on your cell phone talking to your friend.  Yeah.  You're tweeting the whole game.  And you're on.  You don't even know you're at a baseball game by the third inning. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  Those fucking assholes.  How's it to the Yankee Stadium?  Has anybody gone to it?  I haven't gone to either fucking stadium.  My friend Sean has good seats to Yankee Stadium.  I mean, I'm doing better and I'm finally getting friends again.  But I don't have enough yet that will invite me to a baseball game at the new stadiums.  I've been invited to Yankee Stadium.  I should go with my buddy Sean.  Let's go.  Let's go to the fucking stadium.  Yeah.  Take the subway.  Well, the other thing, which is just a crime, and then we'll move into the home run calls,  is my brother has been on the season ticket list for the Jets for years, for over 10 years. 
[00:59:30]  And his number finally came up, but he can't afford it.  So he wants me to buy them.  Oh, boy.  And he laughed at me.  He laughed.  He goes, because you know that thing they got now where you reserve the seat?  You pay for the right to have season tickets?  Yeah, yeah.  I forgot what it's called.  Danny, do you know what it's called?  Travis, do you know what it's called?  I'm fucking you up the ass.  Yeah, basically now you, what is it called? 
[01:00:00]  It's amazing that they're getting this one done and doing this to their fans.  It's not just buying season tickets anymore.  You buy the right to buy season tickets.  You buy the license.  The license.  Thank you.  You buy the right to own the seat.  So you own the seat, and then you have the unbelievable opportunity of buying tickets to sit in that seat.  So if you own the seat, but you can't buy the tickets, then what happens?  Then you're shit out of luck.  So you have to buy both.  You have to, yeah, oh yeah, you have to buy both.  So what's the difference?  You have to buy a license for the seat, and then you buy the season tickets. 
[01:00:30]  What the fuck is that about?  The scumbag sport team.  And is this, did this start in New York, and is it happening elsewhere?  No, it's getting bigger, but yeah, it's in a lot of the new stadiums.  Fuck, a license.  But if you have to buy the tickets, anyway.  Because then you own that seat.  See, it's all about this.  Something happened along the line where the stadium owners, the team owners, they said,  okay, it's not good enough that we got the people coming to our event. 
[01:01:00]  Now we've got to figure out how to get more money from them.  Not just a little more money.  All right, let's raise the price of a hot dog 50 cents.  It's like, no, how do we make a lot more money from these guys?  Ridiculous amounts of money.  And they came up with this licensing fee thing, and it's going through, and it's going to  be in every stadium in America.  God, what pieces of shit.  How much are the tickets, by the way?  How much are the season tickets to the Jets?  Honestly, I don't know.  I've got to ask my brother.  I'm not interested.  I'm not interested in paying for the licensing fee for like four tickets, and then it's ridiculous. 
[01:01:30]  Wait, what is this?  Two Philadelphia Eagles season ticket rights are $38,500.  Okay, for $38,500 though, Ant, you still don't have tickets for the Eagles season.  You get two tickets?  No.  No.  What do you get for $38,500? 
[01:02:00]  Basically, to simplify this, if you want season tickets to the Eagles game, according to that,  if you want those particular seats, write a check for $38,000, start there.  Then you can buy the actual tickets.  This is silly.  It's fucking, they're just pieces of shit.  But you know what?  People keep going.  So I have no mercy for the fans.  Stop going to the fucking games.  Watch them on TV or listen, stop letting them fuck you.  Yeah, watch them on TV, really?  Really?  Watch what they do with that eventually. 
[01:02:30]  You really think in a few years you're going to be able to watch a free baseball game?  Or radio for the advertising.  Well, you kind of can't anyway at this point.  What do you mean?  Yeah, you don't catch all the games.  You've got to sometimes go to a cable outlet, you know, watch it on that.  Not for the Yankees.  Well, they're all right, right, right.  It's on the Yes Network.  It used to be you got every game for free, and now, like Ant said, they're already going  that direction.  Well, you don't get all of them for free, and eventually you're going to get none of them  for free.  And if you want to watch it on HD, you need some kind of a cable outlet or something.  Yeah, but I'm saying to go to the games is disgusting. 
[01:03:00]  Stop supporting these fucking faggot sports.  Stop it.  They're pieces of shit.  They fucking have no regard for you.  So either say fuck them too.  I've been a season ticket holder for the Islanders for probably 10 years now.  If they go this way, and I love my hockey, I'm out.  So out.  And it's not about the money.  I could afford it.  I just don't want to do that.  Jim, you know how much the new Cowboys licenses are? 
[01:03:30]  How much?  For seats?  The best one, $150,000.  A year?  That's not for the tickets, though.  That's for the license.  That's not.  You don't have tickets still after you write the check for $150,000.  I don't know what the license means.  I don't guess.  The license means that you own that seat.  But if you have tickets for it, don't you own it anyway?  You're buying the seat.  It's like a medallion for cabs.  Yeah.  But you don't own the seat because you can't just visit your seat any time.  No, you only own it for the seven games that they play there, or nine games. 
[01:04:00]  Eight.  Eight, right?  Sure.  Yeah, eight.  But you own it forever?  Yeah.  That's your seat.  It's my seat.  Forever.  Forever.  So what if I don't want to buy tickets and I just want to let it sit there empty?  I don't know.  Yeah, what if you don't want to buy tickets?  I don't know.  What if I want to spend $100,000 and never go to a game and just have an empty seat?  And demand that no one ever sits there.  All the time.  That's right.  You demand no one sits in your seats.  Well, you want to put a weird little blow-up doll with a big dildo in its mouth. 
[01:04:30]  You just have it sitting there.  Yeah.  Or you hire someone who's 600 pounds to go sit in your seat and just fart.  I hate, I fucking hate most of these sports teams, man.  I really do.  I can't stand them.  And their market is obviously corporate America.  Yeah.  You know, the blue-collar guys, you know, they don't give a shit about you.  They just don't.  They're pushing you out and letting corporate America, you know, buy these licensing fees 
[01:05:00]  and all that stuff.  God.  It's disgusting, really.  It is disgusting.  I think we got the licensing fee thing down.  I believe that's how I understand it.  That even after you, you know, write that check, you still don't actually have tickets  to the event.  Can someone call and say how much it is for Jets tickets?  I'm curious.  I don't know.  Was that the team?  Were Jets or Giants?  Oh, yeah, of course.  Yeah, we're a Jet family.  I want to know how many.  Were Jets, Mets, Knicks, Islanders?  With some Yankees in there, unfortunately. 
[01:05:30]  A couple Yankee fans.  I'm Cowboys.  My father is Giants.  Really?  I never really liked my dad.  What about basketball and the rest?  Basketball?  No, not really.  Baseball?  He's Mets.  No.  He's Mets and Giants.  Well, it's Yankees.  Yankees.  And that's it.  You don't really care about the other sports for the most part.  Football you kind of like, don't you?  Yeah.  I like the Jets, but you usually wind up watching more Giants games because they just usually  are better.  How about a Jet game at the old Shea Stadium, my friends? 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, that's now you're talking.  Look up that footage.  Now you're talking.  How about the wheel out bleachers into the middle of center field?  It's like I watch Emerson Boozer.  Right.  How about the fucking Jet fans cut to shit until there's a new Jet stadium?  How about you stop letting that shit organization not have a home stadium for their team?  It's fucking embarrassing.  They're building a new giant stadium that both teams will be sharing.  Exactly.  Sharing a stadium.  Why don't they stop?  That's nice.  Sharing is caring.  Put the Jets on Moe Island.  Well, that would be beautiful, but, you know. 
[01:06:30]  I mean, New York only has one New York football team, and it's an old gag, but it's the truth.  The Bills are the only New York football team, but they try to claim that the Jets are actually  a New York team because all their corporate offices are in New York.  Look at that.  Shea Stadium.  That's Shea for a football game.  I think that's an artist's rendering, isn't it?  No, no.  Artist's rendering.  It never looked that cool, man.  You know, the middle of the football field had, like, the diamond and stuff. 
[01:07:00]  It looked so bizarre.  Doesn't it look terrible when they play football on a baseball field?  Oh, yeah.  It looks horrendous.  They really don't do that much anymore, though.  No, no.  They got it all figured out.  It looks awful.  And God, how do they fuck up the baseball field, too?  They're doing it next year at Yankee Stadium.  What?  They're doing an Army-Navy game, I think.  Well, one game.  Stop chiming in with your fucking thoughts.  Really?  I'm helping.  Not only one game, but I mean, like, when they play it every week, it looks awful.  All right.  Hey, speaking of football... 
[01:07:30]  He's down on the pitcher's mound.  There it is.  Yeah, there it is for football at the old Shea Stadium.  Oh, that looks so fucking stupid.  Yeah, the whole diamond, it goes from the end zone to almost, like, what, the 50-yard line  or close?  Yeah.  It's so weird.  In the end zone is, like, the batter's box.  And then first...  Oh, whatever.  You can figure it out.  I never realized, like...  It's almost halfway to the field from the...  Yeah, it's pretty bizarre, right?  From, like, home plate to second base is... 
[01:08:00]  Well, the edge is second, where the outfield starts.  Yeah.  That looks ridiculous.  Doesn't it?  That's how they used to play it.  Silly.  You guys would play there?  Oh, yeah.  Did you guys?  Speaking of football, this couldn't make me happier, because he's such a dick.  Terrell Owens did our show.  Terrell.  Terrell.  He had to keep correcting us.  Terrell.  Terrell.  Even though most of the world says Terrell every single time.  Terrell.  Terrell.  And then my pal, Brother Weez, interviewed him recently and said, what a dick this guy is. 
[01:08:30]  And he's got a reality show.  This couldn't make me happier.  Terrell Owens, reality show, debuted at 798 in cable ratings.  Wow.  Because he's a fucking dick, and he doesn't want to go out and promote it, probably, or  he's not promoting it right, so fucking good for him.  That's pretty good.  He was tied with a 5 a.m. rerun of Fresh Prince on Nick and Night.  All right.  Well, he tied.  A lot of people are watching reruns of the Fresh Prince. 
[01:09:00]  They're trying to spin it to him.  Look, top 800 is good.  Yeah.  You know what?  He's going to really help the Bills.  Go up.  He's going to help the Bills, no doubt.  What's the name of his piece of shit reality show?  I don't know.  It's called Piece of Shit.  I don't know.  To be honest with you.  Anthony, John Sterling's home run calls.  You said these are a couple doozies, huh?  Oh, Lulus.  You want me to just play them?  Yeah, please.  Just because they're horrible.  And again, it'll be a 3-2. 
[01:09:30]  Swung on.  There it goes.  Deep right center.  It is high.  It is far.  It is gone.  Adeku Matsui hit a tremendous home run.  A way out over the grandstand toward the bleacher area.  A thriller by Godzilla.  Oh, the Sayonara Kid ties up the game at four with a tremendous blast.  Stop trying so hard.  He just fucking stinks.  He's trying too hard. 
[01:10:00]  Did you hear him almost say the thriller in Manila?  This asshole almost slipped into Manila.  The thriller by Godzilla.  Oh, stop it.  It rhymes.  But it doesn't end there.  No.  Oh, no.  But the call.  I love the call.  You always say the same thing.  I apologize for being repetitive.  It is gone.  I like the call.  That's all right.  Is he hoping the term a way out catches on so everyone starts calling home runs?  A way out?  A way out.  And he could say, that was me.  No.  No one's going to use that.  Just stop making it about you. 
[01:10:30]  Stop squeezing in your fucking catch.  They're terrible.  If it comes out naturally, I don't mind.  But like we've discussed many times, this guy obviously sits at home and really overthinks  this shit.  He's Shelby's shoehorn.  Fucking stop it.  What can I say?  It's all written on the paper in front of him.  He can't wait for that particular person to hit a home run so he can try out his new  phrase.  His new phrase.  He throws him in after the home run.  It doesn't have the same oomph.  All right, here.  By Godzilla.  And then right after that, I guess Jorge Posada comes up. 
[01:11:00]  Oh, no.  Were there two players in a row?  It might have been.  Oh, fuck.  And that home run went a long way.  Thank you.  A long drive to deep right.  Inglot back.  On the track.  At the wall.  Leaps.  And it is gone.  Jorge Posada hits one in the right field seats.  Great.  Oh, Georgie.  Doce one.  And it unties the game. 
[01:11:30]  Get ready, Mariano.  Jorge Posada.  And Posada and Matsui go back to back.  And a belly to belly.  And the Yankees take a 5-4 lead.  He's fucking terrible.  I love Jimmy.  It makes me so angry to make it so about yourself.  Dude, I got, look at my arm.  You just got goosebumps from douche chills.  I got douche chills.  The hair is staying up on my forearms.  Yes.  That is so uncomfortable.  It's embarrassing.  How does anybody, I can't even listen to the Yankee games anymore. 
[01:12:00]  I used to love John Sterling.  And he now calls it an untie?  Untie the game.  Untie the game.  It's untie the game.  Back to back.  And a belly to belly.  And a belly to belly.  What does that mean?  I don't know.  That's how he should be standing with a fucking, a train engine.  Belly to belly.  Here's the question for the national audience.  Is there another guy out there doing shit like this?  No, no.  That comes anywhere close to this?  Oh, it's fucking, it's not funny and it's not cute.  It's not engaging.  It just fucking stinks. 
[01:12:30]  Dude, he doesn't even do it right.  Is that OCD?  Is that like almost, I don't know.  I mean, there's something, how could you be a normal person and think that's interesting?  What happened was, probably, he tried one, just maybe off the cuff, and he got such a  good reaction that it just fed into his ego and he just went with it.  Georgie juiced one?  And he goes, oh, Georgie juiced one.  Did he?  Did he juice one?  Which one do you want to hear again? 
[01:13:00]  The second one?  I got to hear back to back again.  I don't want to hear that again.  Yes, you have to.  As soon as he said, push out, I get up and hit what I knew.  And a belly to belly.  You don't like it, Jimmy?  I fucking, it makes me so, it's so unnecessary.  I would enjoy it more if he just went, he just made that noise.  I would like it more.  As the guy is running around the base, he should say, and Posada swings.  All right, Posada Hubbard. 
[01:13:30]  Charlie writes, way out, a home run is now a Flintstone character.  Yeah, the way outs.  Yeah, remember the way outs.  Jason, Ohio, go ahead.  Pleasure for me to be on with you this morning.  Pleasure for me.  An honor.  Hey, guys, I was listening to the Yankee game about a week ago, and they had David Cohn in.  And John Sterling asked David Cohn if his perfect game was the best game he ever pitched.  What do you think?  Oh, exactly.  And he stopped and paused, and he just totally ignored the question and started talking to Susan Waldman.  And then they docked with each other and said, a belly to belly. 
[01:14:00]  And then they looked at Susan Waldman's fucking wet-looking mouth.  Dude, you were the serious.  That wet mouth, though.  How could it not be?  Goodness gracious.  Did you feel good when you threw the no-hander?  Or did you feel better about the six-to-two loss to the Angels?  Good question, Muppet Head.  Fucking horrendous announcing booth, that is.  Oh, horrible.  It's awful.  It's stellar and mirror.  We're the only ones that haven't left her alone. 
[01:14:30]  Everyone else felt sorry for her.  Why?  I don't even dislike Susan Waldman.  I actually like her.  Well, she just made a mistake with all the dramatic things.  Dude, it's funny.  It's like, how do you not?  All the dramatic things.  Good gracious.  It's comedy gold.  You can't not run with it.  It really is.  It's fantastic.  Steven S. from Bayshore, ass to mouth and a smelly to smelly.  And a belly to a run with a long win.  Pitch.  A long drive to deep right. 
[01:15:00]  Inglit back.  On the track.  At the wall.  Leaps.  And it is gone.  Jorge Posada hits one in the right field seats.  Oh, Georgie used one.  And it unties the game.  Get ready, Mariano.  Jorge Posada.  And Posada and Matsui go back to back.  And a belly to belly.  And the Yankees take a 5-4 lead.  You can hear it when he goes, goes back. 
[01:15:30]  Goes back to back.  And a belly to belly.  He talks like Karnak.  What is a string of Peloponnes?  What a shithead.  Oh, it's the worst.  That, that, that's horrendous.  That is really hard to listen to.  Terrible.  Worst part is when he releases that fake gasp.  That's Bill in DC.  What's the gasp?  I don't know what that is.  Uh, I don't know.  If you don't buy season tickets, your, your seat license goes into a pool. 
[01:16:00]  All right.  And this one, yeah.  Oh, God damn it.  Think of two households.  You hope that doesn't happen.  Of course.  Doug in Detroit.  Hey, guys.  Where did my ticket and baby go?  Doug E, what's up? 
[01:16:30]  Hey, I wanted to say, out here in Detroit, if the games don't sell out, it's not as simple  as just watching it on TV.  They block it out.  They black it out.  They do that everywhere.  Well, yeah.  They hold the fans hostage, basically.  Yeah.  Which is amazing.  It's amazing that you could like black out the game in the, in the home city.  If, if, if you don't have a sellout, that is so ridiculous. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  It's so fucking ridiculous.  A lot of the, you know, the furniture companies or whatever, uh, you know, they, they buy them  up and try and give them away as promotions and everything.  But when I, when I lived in Buffalo, when the, the bills were having their nice run in  the nineties there, the panic that would come over the city because the word would get  out.  Oh, I don't think we're going to have a sellout.  This game's going to be blacked out.  And then you're, you have businesses and radio stations just trying to buy up all the  tickets just so people can watch the fucking game.  That's, that's, that's a sin.  Well, then people should just stop going. 
[01:17:30]  That's the only way to tell these teams to go fuck themselves is if, if fucking 10,000  less people a game, really, if every game there was 10,000 open seats, they would be,  oh, maybe we're being fucking total douchebags about this.  But no one will ever do that.  No.  I know why?  Because they changed their strategy and, and, and now they go off to the corporate, you  know, dollars.  So when they give the tickets out to the people, so they know that, you know, they'll  get the money that way.  Call them dollarinis.  That's what I do.  Dollarinis.  And with that, we should take our first break.  Yeah.  We got a lot of great stuff today and we got Rich Voss coming in and a little, yeah, I 
[01:18:00]  can't wait to see Voss.  He's always a pleasure.  When's Patrice in?  And I can't wait to see Patrice a little later this morning.  Oh, today?  Okay, good.  Yeah.  So this show is going to fly by today.  Thanks for checking us out.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Boy, we're all looking forward to this movie.  Brad Pitt, Inglourious Bastards, the new film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino.

I just know that the preview is amazing. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, pretty cool.  I love the preview.  I've seen it a million times.  It's about time the movie actually is out there.  Their orders are to kill as many Nazis as they could find, but eventually the Bastards  will get a chance at the ultimate mission, killing Hitler and wiping out the entire  German high command.  Yes, critics already calling Inglourious Bastards an absolute masterpiece and the most  entertaining movie of the year with awesome action sequences, huge lofts, and of course  Brad Pitt kicking ass in an unforgettable role that he does in this movie. 
[01:19:00]  People have been buzzing about it since the movie got a standing ovation there in Cannes,  the Cannes Film Festival.  So it's going to be the most exciting action event of the summer.  Wait, you said huge laughs?  For real?  Yeah.  Well, that's kind of cool.  Yeah, it's got some lofts.

Hello.  To the O.P. and Anthony Show.  We're going to have Rich Vos in studio in a little bit, about 10 or 15 minutes.  Patrice O'Neill a little later today.  Lots going on.  My timing stinks.  What happened?  Oh, you just got your stand ball.  I get my sandwich.  And then I open it up.  So now the cold air conditioning blows on it. 
[01:24:30]  And it coagulates, so I'm fucking eating.  Just chill, because I'll play a Porn and Peener sweeper for everybody.  Ooh.  By Butcher.  Porn and Peener in the morning.  Oh, shit.  That shit is off the hook, yo.  Porn and Peener.  Cunt fucked dick radio.  Beware, this is radio like you've never heard before.  You just know you're not going to hear anything thought-provoking or interesting.  Porn and Peener Show.  Shock jocks Porn and Peener in trouble today.  This time it was Porn.  Porn and Peener.  Fuck you and fuck them. 
[01:25:00]  Porn and Peener.  Weekday morning, 6 to 10 a.m.  Porn and Peener.  Porn and Peener.  Better than Rape Kit and Crawl Space?  No.  Really?  Rape Kit and Crawl Space is still the best show name ever?  Probably.  Ever?  Excuse me.  Best shock jock show ever.  What about Porn and Peener?  Rape in it.  Porn and Peener.  It's got rape in it.  Yeah, and Crawl Space.  I hear Porn and Peener aren't allowed to talk about Rape Kit and Crawl Space.  Rape. 
[01:25:30]  Crawl Space.  Crawl Space is like a...  She's a hole.  Yeah.  See, no one knows that Crawl Space is actually a hole.  There's a chick.  And Rape Kit has a massive ego.  And Rape Kit will not allow Porn and Peener to talk about Rape Kit.  No.  Why would you?  Jesus.  Oh, are we onto something?  Porn and Peener.  It just never ends, does it?  No.  There's something else going on. 
[01:26:00]  Yes, my seat's high.  Yeah, why is your seat high?  I don't know.  I mean, what happened?  You're in a high chair.  I'm small.  Well, you come back down here.  I like it up here.  I like it up here.  No, you're in a power position if you're that much higher.  That's right.  And we can see you're like...  My weenie?  Yeah, we can see...  I don't have a rod, but I can get one.  You don't have a boner.  The old salus.  Oh, there you go.  So, Little Nicky walks down the hall every day.  Yeah, we see him. 
[01:26:30]  We acknowledge his arrival every day.  Yes, we do.  And Little Nicky made a sweeper or some kind of remix about Danny.  Why?  Good.  Because I think Danny rubbed Little Nicky the wrong way.  Why?  I've never spoken to the guy.  Once.  Why don't you like him?  I never said I didn't like him.  I don't have a problem with Little Nicky.  I don't have a problem with the guy.  There's no reason to work with him.  Just like there's no reason to work with the guy that runs serious hits one, so I've never 
[01:27:00]  spoken to him either.  Hold on, because we've got to pause.  Because this bench-clearing brawl...  We're going to get right back to Danny, I promise.  But we were discussing the bench-clearing brawl where the guy has to run all the way out  to the mound.  And it's such a long run that you've got to throw your batting helmet first.  Yeah, he throws his helmet at the pitcher.  This is a Red Sox game.  Your anger is so strong, and you're sick of running, that you just want the action to  start.  So you start with throwing the batting helmet.  You throw your helmet at the pitcher, and then you've got to keep running. 
[01:27:30]  And then the pitcher's backing up, so now it's even further than the mound.  By the time you get there, you're not even angry anymore.  You don't even know why you're running toward him anymore.  You always wonder, because it is kind of a long run, if you think halfway through, like,  eh.  He turns it around.  Look at this.  Throws that big bastard right on the ground.  Yeah, he grabs him and throws him.  Little skinny pitcher.  Throws him down.  Yeah.  Okay.  A little frustrated, were they, I guess? 
[01:28:00]  Oh, yeah.  Red Sox, Yankees, nice little brawl.  Pitcher throws him down good, though, Ant.  He really did.  The pitcher ran a little bit, the pitcher ran a little bit, and then kind of grabbed  him while he was running.  He spun him around, got him going backwards, and then that was it.  Yeah.  All right.  Anyway.  Good one.  It's just funny to see the guy run and run and run and run.  It's like, uh-uh-uh.  And finally get there.  He's exhausted.  He can't even fight anymore.  Like those basketball fights, you know, you'll occasionally see someone foul someone, and 
[01:28:30]  then just clock them in the face.  They're right next to each other.  Football, the same thing.  Hockey.  It's like hockey.  They're right next to each other.  The guy checks them, and he skates up and clots the guy.  Baseball's just like, I have to run way out to the mound.  It's like, all right.  Enough with this running.  Punch him in the face.  All right.  So, Danny.  What's your problem with little Nicky?  That's right.  Like I said, I don't have one.  Jimmy, ask him what his problem is, because he's not answering my question. 
[01:29:00]  I don't know where the aggression is coming from, and why is Danny?  I won't be ignored, Dan.  What's going on with little Nick?  I told you, I've never had a conversation with the guy.  I've never.  You rubbed him the wrong way to the point he spent a lot of time on the production piece.  And comforting resources, apparently, because you have to have somebody else come in, and  it's like a two-minute bit just because.  I'm bashing you, though?  Yeah.  Oh, just.  Well, what, though?  I don't know.  I never did anything to the guy.  I said nothing but call him little Nicky, and we all have.  I don't get it.  I don't know.  You want to listen to the little Nicky production piece?  I'd love to hear it. 
[01:29:30]  All right.  Yep.  Yo, it's the little Nicky joint featuring P.E.  Yo, Danny.  No one ever talked before.  Never even met you, man.  But still.  Fuck you!  Danny is a fag.  A fucking douchebag.  Fag.  Got a ponytail.  Tails like a she-mail.  Danny is a fa-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a.  I have sex with my guy friends.  He's a homo.  Sex with my guy friends.  Guy friends.  We're homo.  Razzle, dazzle. 
[01:30:00]  And he's balding.  Come on.  I wonder what kind of mortals they have.  In his twenties.  Whoa, how'd you get here, Danny?  I'm not good at anything.  Did you ask your mommy?  Mommy, can I be on the Ophie and Anthony show?  Of course you can, honey.  You're a homo.  Danny, what you drinking?  Your breath is always kicking.  Maybe it's the cock that you've been homo licking, licking.  She wanted Austin Powers.  Instead, she got Ed Powers.  I was going to...  Danny likes to butt fuck. 
[01:30:30]  Fat dude's name chug.  Danny's got his balls tucked.  Here's a random duck.  Danny's always drinking, puking in the sink and drinking from the cup that he puff puff pisses in.  Look at him drink, he's an alcoholic.  Buy him a drink, you can get your balls left.  Fill up his cup, you can fuck him in the butt, but wouldn't even care now.  Come in his hair now.  Come, go. 
[01:31:00]  Danny is a fag, fag, fucking douchebag, fag.  Got a ponytail, looks like a shemale.  Danny is a fag, fag, fag, fag.  Fag, fag, fag, fag, fag, fag, fag.  I think there's deeper roots than Little Nicky.  Yeah, what's going on there?  I think this is an Eric thing because obviously he had to be given those drops to have used in that piece.  So I just have a sneaking suspicion it's just an Eric thing. 
[01:31:30]  I have to say, though, it was a production piece.  It's funny.  Yeah, well, you know.  You guys never had a run-in?  Never.  Not once.  Never.  It's probably just not once, not ever.  Sam, do you know anything?  I honestly think he's just kidding.  Do you know anything behind the Little Nicky-Danny feud?  The Gossip Queen.  Of course I do.  Well, from what I know, and this is once that I'm so glad that I have nothing to do with this  because when I heard that for the first time, I heard about this after it was done and said, 
[01:32:00]  Jesus, where did this come from?  And the rumor has it that when Little Nicky's first production piece was put in,  the promo with the baby getting smothered, I guess it was played in the office and I wasn't there.  What's the baby smothered?  It's the replay promo.  The baby got smothered in it with the pillow.  Can we play that, Travis, just so we have all the facts out there?  It runs a lot because it's scheduled, so it runs dark.  The production piece, I mean, production-wise, you got to tip your fucking hat. 
[01:32:30]  I never said he can't do production.  Is he an on-air guy?  No, of course not.  That's why he's in production.  Oh, nice.  Now, he's the best production guy here at SiriusXM.  Is he?  That's what the word on the street is.  Travis, you got the production piece he did for us?  But first, Little Nicky.  He walks down the hall every day and we acknowledge him, right?  He's never been on our show.  No.  A little background on Little Nicky.  The guy is a great production guy. 
[01:33:00]  Why is there a setup to the production piece?  This is how it was cut.  I have no idea.  Ooh.  Is that hooker in the trunk distracting you?  Shut the fuck up!  Just now realizing that bottle of Jack and eight bottle of Coke you did one night  led to this 18-year crying commitment that just shit itself?  Aw, don't cry.  Let's put a pillow on your face.  Whatever your reason is for missing the Opie and Anthony show this morning,  you can catch it again.  Hear it again at 3 and 8 p.m. Eastern on The Virus. 
[01:33:30]  Sirius 197-XM-202.  That's Little Nicky.  All right, so he made that for the show.  Yeah.  And then what was the problem?  What was the problem?  And apparently, and I don't know this for a fact because I wasn't there,  it was played in the office.  Derek might have been there.  I don't know who was there.  D-Boy?  Yeah, D-Boy Mathers.  D-Boy Mathers.  D-Boy Mathers.  D-Boy Mathers.  D-Boy Mathers. 
[01:34:00]  D-Boy is spelled B-O-I.  B-O-I.  With a star over it.  He's like a surfer guy.  He's crazy.  D-Boy.  But what the hell goes on here when we go home?  D-Boy means that you're a fucking boy who's available to suck other men's cocks for money.  Exactly, yeah.  Like I'm breaking news.  Sorry.  All right.  So I guess his production piece was being played in the office,  and rumor has it, this is all hearsay and rumors,  but Danny apparently walked in and had some rolling of the eyes 
[01:34:30]  and look of disinterest while it was being played.  I don't know if it's true or not.  Now, who saw this?  I don't know.  And then reported back to Little Nicky.  That's the thing.  Where are you getting your info from?  Yeah, yeah, where are you getting your info?  Little Nicky.  He said he heard about this,  and again, I didn't tell him because I was in there when Danny did or didn't hear it.  He said he heard about this and then apparently said,  oh, fuck that guy, I'm going to make a piece about Danny.  Nobody asked.  Eric actually did not ask him to make a piece about Danny. 
[01:35:00]  He goes, my next production piece, I'm going to smash Danny.  He's in the office.  But someone must have said to Little Nicky that Danny rolled his eyes.  True.  You who?  I don't know that.  That I don't know.  Why would I roll my eyes out about such a fucking who gives a fuck promo?  Wow.  Who cares?  It's for the replay.  Who gives a shit?  I don't know.  Who was in the office?  As far as when Little Nicky told me this?  No, no.  Who was in the office when Danny rolled his eyes?  I believe Danny and maybe D-Boy Mathers, but I don't know who else was there. 
[01:35:30]  I don't know.  Derek wouldn't have read it out, Danny.  Well, Eric's here.  Was Eric here?  Let's get the scoop from Eric because I'm sure he fucking handed him all the clips.  Oh, yes, he certainly did.  What do you shave with, fucking mulch?  Sorry.  I'm shaved.  I know.  Oh, shit.  Do you just do anything people ask of you?  I'll tell you to fucking cut your throat.  What's wrong, Danny?  Everyone gets their turn in the barrel.  I'm in the barrel.  Eric, I fucking listened to it and I gave it back.  If it was you, I would have just thrown it away or put it in some fucking file somewhere 
[01:36:00]  that says do not use it.  Oh, because you can't take your turn in the barrel.  Dude, I'm in it, bro.  I don't give a fuck.  I'm here.  You just said if it was me, you would have been taken and thrown out.  Oh.  If it was you, Eric, because that's what you do with all the negativity that goes your  way.  Really?  Yeah.  How much negativity is on the show every day?  But it's got to be live.  Can't be a production piece or a replay because you eliminate all records.  That's what you're just saying.  I'm sitting here with a smile, bro.  What are you even trying to say?  You're saying I did this and I didn't do this.  I'm not saying you did it, Eric.  I'm saying that if there wasn't some kind of negative production piece about you, you'd 
[01:36:30]  throw it in a do not use folder.  So you could tell me all you want that, yeah, it's my turn in the barrel.  And I'm like, yes, it is my turn in the barrel.  And I'll take it.  Okay.  I'm not going to run away all upset like you do.  Really?  I'm right here.  So keep throwing it.  Because you're an idiot, dude.  Okay.  Nothing's about you right now.  Sorry.  I'm taking the attention away from you.  Go right ahead.  Whoa.  What is your problem today, Eric?  He's still a little hurt.  Actually, I have a thing with Eric about yesterday because I'd like to know why Eric is so mad 
[01:37:00]  at me specifically because apparently I was the cause of all the shit that went down yesterday  simply because you guys wanted him and I went down the hall to try to get him into the  studio.  Apparently, I shouldn't be doing that.  And like by me doing that.  No, apparently you shouldn't be coming down the hall skipping with a big smile on your face.  First of all, I wasn't skipping.  Come on, they want you.  Two, it's fucking funny.  So I'm going to be fucking smiling, Eric.  If they ask for you, you should come in here.  That's the end of the story.  And I did come in here.  Yeah, after fucking Sam was talking to you for 15 minutes and I had to make two separate  trips down the hall.  So it wasn't your job to come get me. 
[01:37:30]  Well, whose job is it going to be?  It's my job to come in.  I didn't come in.  I came in later.  So I came to get you, Eric.  Okay.  So why am I an asshole?  Because I came to come get you.  Come on, Eric.  It's everyone's turn to fire.  Come right in.  Come on.  What's wrong with you?  Yeah, dude.  I know you've been really busy for the last 12 weeks doing vacation, but maybe you can  take some time out of your busy day and fucking contribute to the on-air product of this  fucking program.  All right.  I'll step back because it seems to be your job now to just chime in and contribute to the  show.  So come in, bro.  Come in.  Whenever the fuck you want, Eric. 
[01:38:00]  No, because it's not my job to come on air.  When they want me, I'll come in.  It's not my job to sit there and say, hey, I'm going to have you.  Not every time they want you to come on air.  That's the problem.  So I don't understand what your problem is with me.  I'm just trying to produce the fucking show.  If they want you in here for a bit, I'm going to go and get you.  It's nothing personal, Eric.  All right.  So you're getting mad at me over this.  No, because you're being a dick for no fucking reason.  You're being aggressive towards me for me doing my job.  Dude, they want you on the air.  I don't give a fuck whether you come on or not.  This has nothing to do with it anymore. 
[01:38:30]  No, it's on this piece here.  Not about what happened yesterday.  Oh.  Yeah, but you're being aggressive for no reason towards me now.  I came in to tell you I had nothing to do with this and you're getting all upset.  Oh, my God.  Bro, but you obviously supplied clips for fucking Little Mickey.  No shit, because he asked me for them.  So I said, sure.  I pulled a bunch of stuff.  Yeah.  Right.  If the piece wasn't about me and they asked, hey, can you give me some clips?  No, you wouldn't provide that because you don't have to work with him.  Right?  That's your logic?  You don't have to work with the guy, so you don't have to talk to the guy? 
[01:39:00]  If he came in and asking for clips about me and it was a production piece about me,  y'all, you wouldn't give that to him.  Right?  Maybe I would.  Maybe I wouldn't, dude.  I don't even know.  Bullshit, you wouldn't.  Relax.  I am relaxed, Eric.  You're the one that fucking can't take this shit.  This isn't about me.  This is about you.  I understand that, but you have to stop deflecting away.  I'm talking to you right now.  Deflecting of what?  Danny, I had nothing to do with this.  I understand that, Eric.  Was I pissed at you yesterday?  Yes.  I've already stated that.  So.  This is about your piece here, not about me. 
[01:39:30]  Fine, Eric.  You win this argument.  I have no idea what you're talking about anymore.  I seriously have no clue.  Okay, someone's being defensive then.  All right, let's talk about little Nicky's piece.  Okay.  That's why I came in.  What the fuck was the point of it?  Talk to him.  This was already being made when he asked me for clips.  So why are you in here?  Because you said, oh, let's talk to Eric.  Let's get to Eric in here to find out what's going on.  All right, well, you have no information.  You can leave now.  Really?  Were you in there when he rolled his eyes?  When he rolled his eyes?  No.  He actually, he said it was playing, and Derek was playing Street Fighter II in the office. 
[01:40:00]  And Danny came in and goes, what is this?  And Derek turned to the woman and said, no, dude, he's really good.  When this piece was playing.  And Nicky heard that.  So how did that info get back to Nicky?  Because Nicky heard that.  He was walking by?  I guess, because this stuff was already in motion when he came and said, hey, listen  to this.  Can you give me any production pieces?  So I said, sure.  He just happened to be walking by the office.  Uh-oh.  I was in there.  Derek was in there.  Or is D-Boy guilty?  I don't think Derek had anything to do with it either. 
[01:40:30]  Did D-Boy Mathers rat out Danny on that one?  I doubt it.  They were playing Street Fighter II in the office.  Hmm.  Hmm.  What?  I don't understand how, like, if I try to bring up a point versus Eric, he has to deflect  it.  Like, oh, it's not about me.  This isn't about this.  And he likes to bring up the fact, like, I was smiling and skipping down the hall.  I mean, that was part of his argument.  No, you asked why I was being aggressive to you.  If I try to bring something up now, he'll just dismiss whatever I'm saying and say it's  not about me.  You did come in with a bit of a chip on your shoulder there. 
[01:41:00]  So how come I'm not allowed to ask you?  Oh, why?  What happened with the last two days?  It's been great around here.  Well, it was your turn in the barrel.  Yeah, I know.  Here's D-Boy.  D-Boy.  Now maybe we'll get some.  D-Boy Mathers.  D-Boy.  What's up, D-Boy?  D-Boy.  What's going on?  Maybe we can get a little more info.  Yeah.  I actually have no idea how this got started, to be honest with you.  Now, do you remember playing the piece and Danny saying something negative about it? 
[01:41:30]  No.  You don't remember?  No.  I don't remember anything.  Were you in an alcoholic haze?  Probably.  Do you remember June?  It was, and someone asked little Nicky.  He's not here right now.  And he also...  He'll be in in 15 minutes.  But he made this statement that he wouldn't be coming on the air.  He would be letting his production pieces speak for themselves.  Oh, okay.  Yes.  That makes sense.  Does Kenny have anything?  Is Kenny kind of, uh, had some, uh...  Why is Danny punching stuff?  Everybody hates me around here. 
[01:42:00]  I don't know.  Oh, no.  Hate is a very strong word.  Kenny, what's the matter?  No, I think Eric won this argument, and I think that song should be nominated for a Grammy.  See, I guess Kenny doesn't like me.  Eric doesn't like me.  Kenny doesn't like me.  I like you.  Eric's mad because you made fun of his tweets.  Yeah, big fucking deal, dude.  Yeah, and they're terrible tweets.  Oh!  And then he deleted them.  Yeah, because he's a homo, because that's what he does with all the fucking shit that he gets knocked for.  He just deletes it or puts it in a do not use folder somewhere because he just can't fucking handle it, dude. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, shit.  Yes, that's right, Eric.  Right.  It's happened multiple times.  Okay.  Yes, it has.  Okay.  Okay.  Damn.  Why don't you guys hug?  I don't know what Kenny's problem is with me.  I'm very polite to him all the time.  I have no idea why Kenny would not like me.  I have no problem.  I'm just giving an objective opinion.  That's all.  Objective opinion.  Yeah.  Eric won this argument, and that song should have a Grammy.  Eric didn't even have an argument.  Yeah, this debate. 
[01:43:00]  Kenny's a dunce.  God bless Kenny.  All right, should we move on?  He's a dunce.  Eric does take it pretty good in the barrel, though.  When he's in the barrel, when he gets bummed out sometimes, he takes a pretty good ass-raving.  Eric takes a pretty good beating.  Yeah, he takes it without lube.  Yeah.  Does he?  Yeah, he smelled my belly button the other day.  Eric, do you want a little belly button juice to fucking chipper you up?  You got some, Jimmy?  I don't know.  That'll straighten everybody out.  That will bring this all around.  Did you get a load in your gut last night? 
[01:43:30]  Not that bad.  No!  I'm so happy.  No, it smells more like shit.  Your belly button smells like your asshole.  I didn't say it wasn't a great night.  All right.  Should we get a quick break in and regroup and get Rich Voss in here?  He's waiting down the hall.  Why don't we get to the bottom of this with little Nicky? 
[01:44:00]  That's obvious.  Oh, yeah.  We'd have to find out.  Is he going to come in?  Will you get some info?  He probably feels like Danny fucked with his piece.  Obviously, he thinks Danny fucked with his piece.  He takes his production very seriously.  And then he turned around and made that.  Let me do a little reporting on this.  All right.  Thank you.  Yeah, the fucking little gossipy, dirty old kid in there.  I get to the bottom of this.  Of course.  You are a bottom.  Who do you think is behind this?  Eric.  It's Eric.  Eric?  Dude, Eric doesn't like me.  I don't know why.  Just because I do my part for the show, he doesn't like me. 
[01:44:30]  I don't understand.  I don't know what it is.  You know, Eric opens himself up to be goofed on all the time.  You know?  He's sitting there with like a thousand sodas and like something to eat.  You're going to goof on him.  Okay?  When it takes you two and a half months to get a week's worth of worse stuff done, you  get goofed on.  All right?  I'm sorry.  But you do.  But no one likes anyone around here.  That seems to be the way.  But somehow you make it work every day.  I mean, aside from the obvious, I get along with Eric.  I get along with everybody around here.  I didn't know that Kenny had some issue with me. 
[01:45:00]  I have no idea.  Maybe he doesn't.  Maybe he was just fooling around.  You know, as far as Eric goes, I...  Who knows what Kenny's thinking?  I think Kenny was just being silly.  Kenny doesn't have issues.  My people with Eric is...  Kenny, do you have a problem with Danny?  No!  I hate everybody equally.  I think Kenny was just being goofy.  Yeah, you know me.  I'm an entertainer.  He does the worst.  Kenny goes from issue to issue.  He's too dumb to have loyalties or hatred.  Oh, of course.  He doesn't care.  No, not at all.  He'll praise you in one moment and then motherfuck you in the next. 
[01:45:30]  He doesn't give a shit.  He's a big piranha.  He just...  All right.  Well, people are requesting it one more time.  That wouldn't be nice.  Yeah, let's sing along.  That would be overkill.  Kenny.  Let's sing along.  That would be overkill.  Maybe if Sam gets more to the story, we'll have to reference it by playing it again.  We need more info, I think.  I think so, too.  On what this is about.  I think so, too.  Because I think somebody had a rat.  I think the odds that he's going to walk by and see Danny roll his eyes, that sounds  like bullshit to me. 
[01:46:00]  There's an ulterior motive here with another...  Somebody got back to him.  It's a conspiracy.  If he wants me to smash the production, I can.  I didn't.  But I could.  Well, that wouldn't be a good thing because production-wise, people are saying, holy shit,  hire that guy.  They really are, yeah.  Yeah, I did do it.  But, you know, the content, you certainly could argue.  Now, who did he produce for, or did he just produce for everybody?  The whole fucking place.  He's the main guy.  Dude.  Sam.  Yeah.  You got the recording device in your hand. 
[01:46:30]  Yes, I do.  And you're ready to go.  Yeah, oh yeah.  Does he show up about now?  We usually do the little Nicky bit between now and 830, so he'll be there any moment.  Did he write that stuff?  Yes, he wrote it.  Okay.  Did he rap on it or sing on it?  Yeah.  Okay.  It was him.  Did Troy Kwan produce it?  No.  He produced it, right?  He produced it himself.  Kenny, you didn't let your producer produce that one?  Isn't Troy Kwan your producer?  Kenny's very territorial.  Yeah, Troy Kwan's with me.  But you haven't done nothing lately.  Yeah.  You just wait, my friend. 
[01:47:00]  For your next hit?  Yeah.  Can you tell we need Friday to be here today?  Oh my God.  It's a powder keg.  You guys should see the TGIF shirts I have made up.  No, it's, but thank God it's Funkus.  Oh, that's good.  Man, it's time.  All right.  We got to get Voss in here.  Why are you circling all this stuff that makes fun of you, Danny?  Well, because I can't handle being in the barrel, apparently, so I don't have the balls  to circle all the negative feedbacks and give it to me.  You just did, though. 
[01:47:30]  What are some of the negative feedbacks?  I never see these fucking things.  I don't want to look at them.  Kevin S. from Brooklyn.  I think Danny needs some thicker...  I'm reading the ones you just fucking marked.  I don't want anything to do with this one.  It's perfectly fair.  It's perfectly fair.  I just don't...  I don't get it.  Seriously, I don't get it.  Somehow this will end up with me and Ant fighting.  I'm just going to read.  I'm just...  I'm a reader.  No, Ant ain't going to fight.  I'm just fucking right.  Danny lost that battle for sure.  E-Rock schooled him in that fight.  Where's that one?  Corey Probus from Whack Bag.  Make them, Doc.  I'm reading them in order.  Bro, the...  Bro, the fourth mic is very sensitive, bro. 
[01:48:00]  Wow, Danny sounds like a real nut right now.  How does Fatty sound rational?  E-Rock, wherever he is.  E-Rock was under control.  I'm taking it.  That means him.  I'm not saying he won or nothing, but he was being...  He was very passive-aggressive.  And this is just unnecessary.  Hey, Jim, what's the best part of showering with an eight-year-old?  Slick their hair back and they look six.  Matt in Missouri.  I heard that joke with seven and four.  Jesus.  Yes, of course.  I got some.  Kevin S. from Brooklyn.  I think Danny needs some thicker skin.  He can dish it out, but can't take it.  E-Rock takes a lot of shit every day. 
[01:48:30]  Marcel from Rhode Island.  Danny sounds like he lost a guitar hero match.  Shit dick from Jersey.  Are you guys having the big rematch?  Shit dick from Jersey.  To be honest, I was practicing and then I fell off and I haven't played.  So what's happened to the last day?  We should do it.  Fuck Danny and his shitty opinions on American History X.  Bald fuck.  Whoa.  Bobby B. from Brockton.  From what I hear, E-Rock is beating Danny in this argument.  Surprising.  Danny sure wants a pity party for himself.  Man up, dude.  That's Greg Brady's leftovers.  All because of... 
[01:49:00]  Was there any positive ones?  No.  What?  No.  A pity party.  Usually you get a couple thrown in there.  I don't know.  No one's on my side of this one.  Randy Moore, Danny be a fucking man.  It's about time E-Rock stood up for himself.  Danny can't hack being in the barrel and turn it into an attack on E-Rock.  There's more coming in as we speak.  Take your lumps, young man.  You should be going after little Nicky and everyone that was involved in that.  So let's get some more info and then see where this goes, right? 
[01:49:30]  Wouldn't that be the way to go?  We got to hear from little Nicky at some point.  Fight.  Fight.  Oh.  This seems like there's something else going on.  Fight.  Fight.  I'm a fatty and a wife.  I'm a faggot Jew that can use a computer and suck Anthony's balls.  Oh, shit.  Now he's never...  Is voice instant feedbacking from...  Never suck my balls.  That was actually just one of my thoughts.  He's yours?  All right.  You get the point.  We'll get more info.  Little Nicky should be here any moment.  And Sam's going to attack him with the...  I had no idea what he did. 
[01:50:00]  I didn't know what Nick did.  I just...  I didn't even know what his real name is.  I just know he's little Nicky.  I don't even...  What is his real name?  Jerry.  Jerry.  I don't...  I don't want to know his real name.  He's little Nicky.  Jerry.  Well, he was definitely pissed off.  Created an image.  Hopefully we'll find out more after the break.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Rich Voss joins the program.  I think you're playing Chicago, right, Rich?  Hold on.  Oh, Lakeshore's a nice theater, man.  Lakeshore?  Lakeshore Theater in Chicago?  And Bonnie's on the show this week, so you get two headliners.  Very cool.  Yeah, I'm there this weekend. 
[01:50:30]  What Friday, Saturday?  Friday, Saturday.  Yeah, usually the weekend falls on a Friday, Saturday.  No, this weekend, Tuesday and Wednesday.  Could have been Thursday through Sunday.  Did you almost give your phone number out on stage?  Oh, yeah.  Somebody tweeted me.  This Twitter, man, keeps me informed with everything you fuckers are doing.  Supposedly you were...  You did a small gig, right?  A small gig this weekend.  It was a bad gig.  I mean, it's safe to say you guys get bad gigs every once in a while.  It wasn't her.  It was me.  And it's safe to say I get a lot of bad gigs. 
[01:51:00]  There weren't a lot of people at this particular gig, which is unfortunate because, I mean,  as much as we beat up Rich Voss, he's great.  He really is great.  Where were you?  Yes.  But it was a small little place, and you decided it was so small he was going to have fun with  it, and you were going to order pizza for the whole room, right?  I did order it, yeah.  You did order it, and as the guy, he's on the phone with the pizza guy, and of course  they want confirmation, so they want your phone number, so stupid over here, starts giving  the phone number in front of everybody, then realizes, this is what the guy said on Twitter,  realizes and then runs to the corner. 
[01:51:30]  Wait, where was this?  In Allentown, you know, at the Ramon.  Oh, I saw out there.  Huh?  You saw out everywhere.  How many?  Your race, your manhood.  How many people?  How many people?  Yeah.  Friday, well, of course, there were 70 on Friday.  It always seems like 100, and then Saturday was completely dead.  Really?  There's a music festival in Bethlehem where I was, like free, like concerts throughout 
[01:52:00]  the city.  I got buried by a music festival in the Vernon Hills.  But it was free and stuff, but it doesn't matter.  How many people, though?  70 on Friday.  No, I know.  30 on Saturday.  30.  30 people.  And I'm not lying.  I was on stage.  That's fucking frustrating.  But I still give a show no matter what.  That's like our Halloween party we had.  Oh.  You don't understand.  You don't understand.  Have you ever driven home from work and tears just started coming down your eyes?  Going, listen to me.  Well, let me ask you.  Three years ago, I was in theaters, and now it's unbelievable. 
[01:52:30]  I'm fighting with B rooms.  Oof.  But you know what?  Here's my theory.  I've been doing this for 25 years, and I know I will rise.  It's up and down.  Of course it is.  It's like a heart monitor.  Dude, you don't have to defend yourself.  No, I do it for myself so I don't kill myself.  But I already said that.  Oh, okay.  Give me that nana.  But I already said that.  I'm sure Lake Shore is going to be a huge success for you, but every once in a while,  because of circumstances or whatever, you're going to have a bad gig.  Yeah.  But that's not the point of the story.  The point of the story was that you ordered pizza for everyone, and you almost gave your 
[01:53:00]  phone number out.  Well, the circumstances are that I haven't been on fucking TV.  No, I was on actually last week.  But here's...  What were you on?  Dateline?  Oh, God, you got me there.  On Marlon's?  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  On The Weeknd.  And I was on Martin Lawrence's, that First Amendment, the Afro-American show.  I don't know.  It's on Starz.  They're big fans of mine.  And I just got back from the Montreal Comedy Festival that I did.  How was that? 
[01:53:30]  How was that?  I killed that on the fucking shows.  It was great.  But it doesn't mean anything to you guys, right?  Well, I mean, you know what's...  I think that festival's for the new kids, you know, like the new faces and stuff.  And, you know, it's the age...  It's the same people I've seen for the last 15 years, you know what I mean?  I know everybody that was there.  You know, some lady asked me if I wanted to do Australia.  I couldn't think of any fucking thing worse to go to Australia for three weeks.  Yeah, that's what I want to do is start a new career on another continent. 
[01:54:00]  I can't believe I said that right.  Why not, though?  Why not go to Australia?  You meant to say country.  I know, huh?  Why not go?  Because I don't want to go for that long.  We're going to Hawaii for a couple days in September.  I don't want to do that.  Why?  Why would you want to go to Hawaii?  What's wrong with you?  Well, what does that got to do with anything?  Because we got to fly there on a Tuesday.  We get there Tuesday night.  It's 10 hours and 40 minutes.  You can't even upgrade. 
[01:54:30]  I try to upgrade with miles.  They said there was no seats left to upgrade.  Plus, to upgrade, it was 17,000 miles, plus $500.  I said, why don't I just buy a first class?  17,000?  17,500, plus $500 to upgrade.  First class to Hawaii.  Yeah, really?  10 hours.  All right.  Jesus, what are you sticking your neck and eyes over?  Calm down, lizard boy.  Jump to Atlanta.  He's a puddle jumper to Buffalo.  Across the country and an ocean. 
[01:55:00]  Fucking J.  So, we're flying there for, like, on a Tuesday, we do the show Wednesday night, and then leave  Thursday to L.A.  But we're doing it to go to L.A., you know, to shoot some stuff.  That's what you're doing.  It's your sunburn.  Oh, sorry.  Oh, I thought you slept at his house last night.  So, I was in the bathroom.  Anthony passed out on a floaty in his pool for two hours with the blazing sun.  So, now the sunburn's starting to itch a little bit.  I got sunburned.  That's his name, floaty?  Yeah. 
[01:55:30]  Floaty.  What the fuck?  Did you get a good night's sleep or something?  I was in the bathroom.  This is true.  I was in the bathroom.  I was pinching a loaf.  And I walk out the stall.  And there's a guy taking a pee.  And I see the back of his head, and it's blonde.  And I thought it was you.  I go, what's up, faggot?  And he turns around.  And it wasn't you.  You've got to be careful.  You know how many faggots walk around this joint every day?  But he had blonde hair and, like, a fucked up little kid's crew cut.  So I thought it was you.  What did you say? 
[01:56:00]  Did you say sorry?  No, I just kept walking.  They'll tell you to, you know, to beat it, never to return.  Oh, that's funny.  That is funny.  And why is Jimmy showing his rock?  I can't help it.  I have it.  Sometimes the Alex just kicks in when you're not ready for it.  The ad is like, when you're ready, it's there for you.  It sure is.  It's like, when you're not ready, it's embarrassing to have.  Oh, I don't care.  You don't care, I know.  Oh, fuck.  He actually puts it out into a pointy pub tent in his pants.  When you go on the road, isn't there something about hotel rooms that make you, like, you can't stop jerking off? 
[01:56:30]  Like, is it the heat or the smell of the toilet seat?  Is it the heat?  What are you talking about?  Just the warm air in the room.  There's something in the hotel room that makes you just want to shoot loads all over the place.  It's the, you don't have to fucking clean up.  You don't have to do anything.  I'm not going to walk around with jizz on my stomach all day.  Of course you've got to clean up.  No, it's too busy.  It's on your back.  You can fucking wipe it on the pillow.  Who cares?  Throw the pillow on the floor.  It's not like home. 
[01:57:00]  I do that at home, too.  I got a wife.  She's a jizz pillow cleaner.  Is that what it is?  Yeah, I think it's just that you know you're alone, and you've just got plenty of room.  It's all, whatever you want to do.  You've got the internet.  Do you ever stay, you know, I think a therapist or doctor told me that if you stand in the mirror  and jerk off, it's like schizophrenic behavior.  Oh, yeah.  Is that true?  Why the fuck would you do that?  You jerk off in front of a mirror. 
[01:57:30]  It's so fucking cool, because you don't look at your face.  You just look at the cock in your hand.  Why are you looking at your cock?  You just look.  What you do is.  What is cool about that?  What does that mean?  What does that mean?  Because you pretend it's not you there, and you're looking at another cock in a hand.  Yeah, I guess that's like crazy.  Yeah, it's not gay, but it's wild.  No, it's completely gay.  I'm with that.  Why is that cool?  Why would you want to look at another man jerking off if it's not your face? 
[01:58:00]  I don't know.  It's just something about it where you're not looking at your head.  You do it so your head's above the mirror.  Well, you don't want to look at yourself anyway, because that's silly.  You just look silly.  Yeah, it does look silly.  But if you just see the hand and the cock, there's something about it.  Why is there something about a cock and a hand jerking off that you want to look at?  I don't fucking know.  I don't have the answers to these things.  He looks at his little hands and his small neck, and he just pretends he's looking at a child.  Creep.  Oz, you've got to explain that.  That don't make sense.  Well, you've got to try, and then you'll get to feel true. 
[01:58:30]  How do you explain?  I'll try it.  I'll come back with a report.  I think I'm a pedofoil.  I don't know.  It's just, it's like, I don't know.  You ever, when you're, okay, how about this?  This could sound gay, but I don't.  Oh, boy.  That means it's really gay.  You ever, like, jerk off?  With your mouth wrapped around a dick through a hole in the wall?  Who hasn't?  It's not gay.  I can't wait till yours gets stapled.  Oh, does that happen?  I don't know.  What do you think? 
[01:59:00]  I put my dick through a hole in the wall in Author's Depot?  How would you know that they might even staple his dick?  Because on the Shield, I told you, last time I was in, on the Shield, they were, the guy  was there with a hammer, so they, you know, they'll do it with a staple.  All right, what's the thing that might sound gay?  You ever, like, you're jerk off, and it's so crazy in your head, you go, this time I'm  going to taste it, but you never get to that point.  Like, right after you come, you go, nah, I'm not going to.  You ever do that?  Yep.  Oh, you have?  Oh, there's a photo.  Why would you want to taste? 
[01:59:30]  I don't know.  I don't, because I've never did it.  Oh, shut up.  So, I'm just, these are just questions I've thrown out.  All right.  All right, so let's move on.  No, I can't really say.  Yeah, everybody's thought of that.  I've wanted to take, no, no, no.  A little bit.  No, I was talking the other day about, you come inside a girl, and then you go down on  her, but not stick your tongue way inside and get your jizz out, but, you know, you just  flick the clit with your tongue a little bit.  Really? 
[02:00:00]  Because the jizz is way up there.  Well, first of all, if you come inside a girl, and you still want to do things after  there's something wrong with you, because if you come inside a girl, you want to get  her the fuck out of your life, okay?  I don't know why they're coming, they should call her leave.  Get the fuck out, okay?  All right.  A little joke.  Look at Jimmy's face.  Jimmy's teeth hurt.  You know what?  You were on a great roll, too.  Until you dove into your ass.  Why did they call it coming?  They should call it leaving.  You should buy them to a Vlasic pickle after you say that.  Little Nicky was making his walk down the hall, and then he backed up. 
[02:00:30]  Sam!  Little Nicky!  That way!  Run!  And here comes Little Nicky.  It's Little Nicky.  He's thumbs up.  He doesn't even know.  He doesn't even understand the problems he caused.  Sam's got the recorder.  Little Nicky's midway down the hallway now, and he's blowing him off.  He's shaking his head no.  He's kind of waving like he's got something to do.  Now he's doing the smack dance thing.  And Sam just followed him. 
[02:01:00]  He gave me the thumbs up.  He gave Danny a thumbs up.  All right, there.  See, everything's good.  Everything's good.  He gives everyone a thumbs up.  But I don't understand why he won't come in here to talk about it.  Because he's not an on-air personality.  But then Sam tried to get him to say something, and it looked like he wasn't successful with that.  But he's still following Little Nicky.  No, no, I think he asked him.  From what I saw, he asked him to talk about something.  And Little Nicky was like, I can't do it here.  I've got to get my auto-tumor.  And he followed him.  Yeah.  And then he followed him into his studio, where I think they'll have a little interview. 
[02:01:30]  Hopefully we'll get to the bottom of the Danny-Little Nicky fight.  Yeah.  Because a lot of people are very confused.  What is it?  But I did lick it that recently.  I'm trying to find a picture.  You licked it yourself?  I licked clean my face.  Dude, you didn't see his tweet where he's licking his own cum?  I'm not sure.  All you see is me licking my hand.  No, you could see the glistening jizz.  You can't see what it is.  I think you could kind of tell.  You could see the glistening jizz.  Something horrendous was going on.  You're not licking blueberries now.  We could see that.  Wasp wants me to address the fact that when I came back in, I had a tin of blueberries, 
[02:02:00]  which I was very much looking forward to finishing, and I came back in, and he's mashing his little  fists.  His hands are so small, he had both hands in my blueberry tin.  It was really funny.  And he was beating them up, and when he was done, still half of them were uncrushed.  He almost broke his wrist.  Rugged blueberries.  You beat up your blueberries for about ten minutes.  But it was all fair.  I couldn't argue.  They deserved it.  They were sitting there.  Yeah. 
[02:02:30]  Delivery.  Patrice, what's up, brother?  Patrice O'Neal.  Hi, Patrice.  Hey, Patrice.  Patrice.  Looking all smooth and shit.  What's up?  Good morning, everyone.  Hi, sweetie.  Always looking smooth.  Wearing the Billy Jacks hat.  What's wrong?  Sit down.  I just went right in town, man.  Norton.  What's up, Patrice?  Norton.  How are you?  Richard?  He's wearing the Billy Jack collection.  Why don't I get anything?  Look, if you wait over there, and you usually give an elbow.  I don't give an elbow.  I'll give you whatever you want.  I'll give you whatever you want.  That's tempting.  Jesus. 
[02:03:00]  Whoa, that's an offer.  God damn, he gives a good hug.  I'll say.  What are you guys talking about?  I heard an argument today.  You've got to cut your nails, though.  There's an argument.  I heard something today driving in.  Danny and little Nicky, but we really don't know.  We're trying to get more info.  I don't even know what it's about.  It's bigger than you think.  What?  It's bigger than you think.  It is bigger?  Which one?  Do you need to be there, Danny, or do you want him there?  No, no, no.  I think Danny's right as far as it's bigger than just a little Nicky.  I don't know.  I'm not convinced.  Danny thing.  I'm not convinced that the guy's really mad at Danny, though.  It's not even that argument.  I'm telling you.  Remember me and Danny had something? 
[02:03:30]  I've been saying this since then.  Something's wrong with Danny.  I don't know how this became the me show today.  I know people very well.  Yeah.  Something is in Danny's craw that's bothering him.  Something personal or business.  I don't know what it is.  But Danny, even the argument today, E-Rock had a sense of charm about even how unfunny the argument was.  There was a sense of charm there and a sense of not really personal. 
[02:04:00]  Like if Eric was doing more of the show.  Something's going on with Danny.  He thinks people are out to get him.  Something is happening.  And y'all are not helping.  He could be going into mental breakdown.  I'm not helping him.  I'm not going to deny anything that Patrice is saying.  However, the argument that me and Patrice had, which was I think over a year ago already.  Thank God I wasn't here for that long.  Is that that long ago?  No, he was here.  You were here.  That wasn't that long ago.  You was here.  Oh, that thing with the computer?  We didn't argue.  That was like for an hour.  The thing about the dirty... 
[02:04:30]  Right, right, right.  Yeah, the website.  The dirty website.  But I didn't take that.  That something else is going on, man.  When I was doing Black Phillip, you could see that something's happened and no one's  talking about it.  And this guy could kill himself.  The argument, the Black Phillip argument.  Or drop off his goddamn cliff.  Not the Black Phillip.  Look, the one that we have, we've been kind of like going, hey Danny, hey Patrice, since  then.  Oh.  Since the, since that.  But I know something else is wrong.  I'm not taking it personal.  I just know something.  You know when something's wrong and you're trying to pretend like nothing. 
[02:05:00]  But something's wrong.  It's not.  I'm not even taking it personal.  When we argued about that goofy...  The website thing.  The website and that, all that shit.  That was, that was, that wasn't anything.  That was just the surface.  Symptomatic.  Yes.  You think there's something underlying.  Yes.  I know it is.  So if I would have clicked through to whatever site you wanted me to go to and then get my  computer messed up, like that would have been fine.  I thank God that was it.  But something else might have happened.  I'm glad that was it.  But I'm telling you, dude, I can hear, I heard the argument.  It's Danny, Danny's not, something's wrong with Danny. 
[02:05:30]  And no one's helping.  Something's wrong with Danny.  You hang out with Danny.  What's wrong with Danny?  I don't know.  We're both enablers of each other.  How can you ask?  He pretends that you're not a falling down drunk and he pretends he doesn't have the  people skills, the Gestapo.  Anthony's going, compared to me, nothing's wrong with him.  Danny.  Anthony doesn't want to hear anybody tell him his liver is disintegrating.  It's hilarious.  If two guys can, it's fucking convincing each other they're social drinkers.  Most people, most people start at 1130, don't they? 
[02:06:00]  It's fucking, it's fucking Sid and Sid.  I love both of y'all.  I don't want to say I love Danny.  I just know he's not ready to be talked to yet.  No intervention.  Something's wrong.  But in all fairness, with Danny, this, this production piece came out of nowhere.  But that's still nothing.  So that's still, there's still something underlying.  It did seem a little personal for a comedy piece about like stuff that maybe goes out 
[02:06:30]  over the air.  Or if you want to put Danny in the barrel about something, there's clips that you could  use that are, but that seems a lot more personal.  He's funnier than what's going on.  Danny's a funny guy.  And he's, and he's a smart guy.  And he's a funny guy.  He's starting to get serious.  Remember how what you guys started to get?  Once he ever made you.  Very serious.  Danny's made you laugh.  Danny's a funny guy.  I'm telling you.  Who?  The guy that left a long time ago.  The guy that knows karate.  Oh, man.  No, not Poe. 
[02:07:00]  The other kid that was with you years.  Fan?  Fan.  Ah.  You could see Fan started to drift away into seriousness.  Like something happened where he just got serious.  I'm serious every day.  Danny's fun, more fun and funnier than he's been, than he's been acting.  That Eric thing, it was like, you go, this can't be a real argument over this goofy sissy  that runs around doing production. 
[02:07:30]  And you better watch out.  You're going to have a production piece instead of made of action.  Who gives a shit?  He's good with that auto-tuning, man.  Be careful.  Who cares?  I'm just saying, what's the kid?  Little Mickey, whatever.  Jerry, I guess is his real name.  And I mean that with all love in my heart.  Whatever.  But I know something's going on.  I know it.  Danny, comment?  I fucking know it.  Is your life falling apart?  It's not falling apart.  Do you see what you're doing?  I'm not saying it's fucking falling apart.  That's basically what you're saying.  And he doesn't think he can talk to anybody here. 
[02:08:00]  Boss is choking on Norton's fart that he's talked in through in his face.  Jimmy had his hands down the back of his pants.  And I look.  Like, what is he doing?  And he gives me the, shh, don't say anything.  And then I hear this muffled sound.  And he takes his hand and just wafts it into Boss' face.  I opened it like a gift in front of Richard's mouth.  But now it's completely released in the room.  That is horrific.  I'm sorry.  Like, that's why.  Oh, can you remind me of some point tonight?  I had a weekend off. 
[02:08:30]  I saw four movies.  Oh, it looks.  Well, I'd rather talk about the movies.  Because Danny's not going to give us much on this right now.  I love Danny.  I wish I could.  Wait, how can you say, I can never say, like, how can you say, I love him or I love him?  Because no one's ever loved you, Richard.  I don't know what that's like.  For real, I love him.  Doesn't that make you feel weird to go, I love, like, I love Opie, I love Danny?  Not even a little.  Meaning, I love you guys.  Like, you know what?  Just because you're uncomfortable with the word love doesn't mean we can't enjoy it.  There's something you like when you see him, man. 
[02:09:00]  I love you, Voss.  When I see you, I'm excited to say, look, Patrice, give Rich Voss the hug you just gave  me and watch him completely fall apart.  Look, look, look, look.  Look at him.  He hates me.  Oh, look, he can't take it.  Look, he can't take it.  Oh, he stinks in here.  Come on.  Come on.  See, it's all right, Rich.  It's okay.  It's all right.  A little human contact.  Love you.  Ugh.  Nah, I didn't say, I didn't say, love you.  I know we're throwing that term around, but when you use it for your friends, it's just a  different thing.  I like you guys a lot.  I don't know if you're fucking...  You love us. 
[02:09:30]  You dummy.  Of course you do.  Rich, have you ever loved anything?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Rich is a hurt man, but he's lived in a world of shank you in the back after you smoke crack  with you.  He lives in a world of, I'll throw hot bleach in his face, my friend's shoes, right after  we tell you we love you.  My friend and I were smoking crack, and we were like best friends, and he took a hit and  fell out the car door.  Wait, why is Danny walking down the hall now?  Did you see the way he walked away?  Danny's a juicy rump.  Like Bruce Banner. 
[02:10:00]  Bruce Banner.  I'm telling you, I'm going to get it out of him, man.  Way to go.  Even though Little Nicky's bit...  Why is he walking down the hall?  He went to kill E-Rock.  He fucking hurt.  Wait, Little Nicky's bit.  He's going to talk to someone.  That's how Danny gets.  When he needs to talk to someone, he leaves and goes and does it.  Little Nicky's bit was a little personal, but it was still, when you do a bit about someone  on this show, you probably hit harder sometimes than you need to, because you hear the tone  of this show, and then you figure to have an impact, you've got to hit pretty hard.  Right, right.  A lot of times it's not even personal.  Yeah, I told him this morning, Kenny hates me. 
[02:10:30]  Everyone hates...  No one fucking hates Danny.  I don't think people think about him.  It's sad.  What does Little Nicky do?  He works for this show?  He does production.  He's supposedly the best production guy here.  So far, what I heard, I like.  It's serious?  Like, he's like the main guy?  Well, I'll leave him alone.  I don't want a bunch of fat...  Kenny, do we have an update on Sam?  Is he getting some audio from Little Nicky?  Oh, I saw.  I'm going crazy.  And I just saw Little Nicky go...  Sam's getting audio.  Yes.  So we'll have an update.  We'll get Little Nicky's side of this. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  All right, good.  No one's going anywhere today.  Patrice, four movies?  Dude, I took a...  There's nothing to see in theaters, though.  No, not four movies at the theaters.  Four movies I haven't ever seen.  Oh, two surprisingly good, and I was anti both of them and watched them.  Wow.  And two, one, almost being the worst movie I've ever seen in my life,  take over number one over Battlefield Earth.  Wow.  And is it going to be a surprise, that movie?  Uh, no.  Well, maybe. 
[02:11:30]  The ones I saw that was good, Ghost Town.  I loved it.  I was like, the idea of it, but Ricky Gervais is the funniest asshole maybe in the history  of movies.  I loved that fucking movie.  It was a fucking great movie.  Yeah, Gervais.  Bobby stole the movie, too.  What did you like about Ghost Town?  Bobby was good.  Bobby was good in the movie, man.  Bobby, yeah.  Did you cry?  Uh-huh.  I was on a plane watching...  You're a fucking faggot, no?  I didn't.  I cried.  A crying movie?  I did at the end when all the things, the ghosts were coming, I was crying a little bit. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, when they were...  I can see where he was crying.  What the fuck?  He finally decided to help the ghosts, and he found out that the ghosts didn't have unfinished  business.  The people left them all.  So they started actually being happy and going away.  Ah, right, right, right.  And everyone that usually bugs me in movies, Taylor Leone, which makes me...  Like, I was wishing she could kill the Deep Impact when she held her father.  It was such a great scene that just watched her get washed away.  But she didn't even bother me. 
[02:12:30]  It was a fucking good movie.  Yes, it was.  The other movie I saw...  Wait, hold on.  But Jimmy said he cried on a plane.  I gotta hear that again.  Oh, I had to turn it off.  I had to turn it off.  I had to turn the fucking...  I could not finish the movie because I was tearing through my sunglasses.  It was embarrassed.  It's just the end.  You weren't embarrassed that you were wearing sunglasses on a plane?  You can't...  Wait a minute.  Hold on a second.  Why would I be embarrassed?  Who wears sunglasses on a plane?  People are sitting in front of it, asshole.  A pilot.  Why?  Because the sun's breaking through the fucking...  Who wears sunglasses on a plane?  The windows were open. 
[02:13:00]  He doesn't want to be bothered.  And I also...  I'll tell you why.  I said tears.  You can't afford to lose any of that important mucus that's inside your body to get you from  drying up on the side of the beach.  No, I was...  These guys are on fire.  What are you, hate me?  Dude.  Dude.  I'm just saying.  I'm just saying.  What am I, a mollusk?  When you're in the fucking barrel, take it.  I can take it.  I look like a scallop.  We got it.  Jeez.  So wait.  So no, I put my sunglasses on because I was crying.  I was embarrassed.  I had tears from that movie.  Dude, it was...  No way. 
[02:13:30]  I can see where you cried at that.  Not even...  But I couldn't believe I...  Then I watched another one that I was...  Looked in the mirror at shock that I was liking.  And laughed hard.  Stepbrothers.  You know what?  I fucking...  I've turned my...  I hated that movie when I first saw it.  And it was on the other night.  That's why.  I kept watching it.  I was in Philly and I'm like, you know what?  I think I might be turning around on this fucking movie.  Dude.  No way.  I thought it was so ridiculous.  John C. Reilly.  John C. Reilly is the 40-year-olds that are living with their parents acting like they're 
[02:14:00]  12 or whatever.  Dude.  I think I'm turning around on that movie too, Patrice.  They were exactly how 12-year-old boys who hate each other would.  They made me fucking laugh.  The concept was ridiculous.  It was.  That's what fucked it up.  Now, but stepbrothers will make you laugh.  Even though that dumb...  Jay Moore said it's the funniest movie he ever says.  Somebody should punch him in his stomach.  Really?  But he...  It was...  I couldn't believe I watched those two.  Now...  Wait, did you see the one with Malkovich where he plays the mentalist? 
[02:14:30]  Just don't ever say his name again.  Just say John M.  We'll know who you mean.  That really...  Malkovich.  I didn't know who you mean.  Malkovich.  Malkovich.  What did he do in...  Malkovich.  What did he do in mental chips?  Stepbrothers, you're right.  I think you're right about that one.  Lakeview Terrace.  Oh.  What is that?  Oh, that's the one with Samuel Jackson as the cop or something.  Who hates interracial couples. 
[02:15:00]  All right.  To the degree in which he turns into Jason for Friday the 13th and they had to kill him.  It was...  Are you serious?  He is immune.  Immune to end of the career movies.  It's like...  Yeah.  Like, this movie should have put him back, you know, as cameo.  Snake on a plane should have put him out.  Snake on a plane should have ended it.  Lakeview Terrace.  He's a single father.  They started off where he's supposed to love his children. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  And he sees a couple moving next door to his house.  He's already a little angry.  But then he finds out that it's an interracial couple.  Black woman, white guy.  And evidently, his wife was killed in a car accident as she was driving to go fuck a white guy.  A white guy.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  So, the whole movie is him just disintegrating.  Into, like, he puts a nail through a cigarette to say, don't smoke in our neighborhood. 
[02:16:00]  He's shining a light through their window.  He fucking goes crazy to the point where he gets one of his informants to come try to rape the guy's wife.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  I gotta see this.  The movie now.  And then he loses.  He hates white people.  But there's things in the movie that's so bad.  Like, everyone else in the movie is an interracial couple except for him.  He's a raven black lunatic.  But then he goes to a party over their house.  And there's a black guy with a white woman. 
[02:16:30]  There's a Chinese guy with an Italian.  There's an Italian with a fucking Mongolian.  And they're all sitting there just relaxing and eating food.  And he's looking like the odd man out.  He calls them tree-hugging hippies.  And they call him a fucking man.  You're out of touch.  And he just turns into the black Hulk.  The black Hulk.  Until he goes to the point.  It is fucking awful.  Really bad.  But it still ain't.  Well, Mooney said.  Paul Mooney was talking about Samuel Jassy.  He goes, oh, white people love Samuel Jassy.  And he's right. 
[02:17:00]  They love him.  Everything is, and the brother, the brother, the bad brother.  He's fucking the cadence of his speech.  He's always got to talk like this.  Dude.  When you see Lake Voo Terrace, you're going to laugh.  Is it the worst movie, though?  No.  Oh, wow.  So Patrice has the worst movie.  May beat Battlefield Earth.  Battlefield Earth now was, arguably, the worst movie ever made.  Caddyshack 2, let's not forget it. 
[02:17:30]  I want to throw that out there.  The thing is, that's a throwaway comedy.  Yes, there's a context.  They meant.  You're talking about a movie that they thought they spent years on and really fine-tuned.  That movie was supposed to be like, this is fucking an amazing motion picture.  And it's a lump of shit.  Fucking John Travolta.  No, no, no.  Julian Moore.  Oh, the one that's worse than Battlefield Earth?  Yes, Julian Moore was in it.  Not Sam Rockwell.  Norman? 
[02:18:00]  The guy that was in Windtalkers and The Last Castle.  Mark Russell.  Oh, Errol Flynn.  Mark Russell.  Yeah.  Julian Moore.  The girl from I Am Legend, who was the only other person in I Am Legend.  Right.  Sam?  The dog?  And the bitch and the kid.  Oh, yeah.  Blindness.  I've never heard of this.  Blindness.  The movie's called Blindness?  Dude.  I don't even remember hearing about it.  What the fuck is that about?  But it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, if not the worst movie I've ever seen. 
[02:18:30]  Then you didn't see Schenectady, New York.  What?  Schenectady, New York.  You can't say Schenectady, New York.  Say it again.  You had it right.  Say it, Rich.  You had it right.  That's the worst movie ever.  Say it.  Say it.  Schenectady, New York.  Schenectady.  Schenectady.  You are as far...  You're frighteningly stupid.  Schenectady.  You're frightening and stupid.  You try to say it.  Schenectady.  Did you just decide to stutter?  Schenectady.  You try to say it.  Schenectady.  How far should I say it?  I'll say it 30 times later.  You said Schenectady. 
[02:19:00]  There's an N towards the end of it.  Shut up.  I tried again.  Do you say I wouldn't?  Anyhow.  No, it's anyhow.  You have to see...  Cool whip.  Whip.  Whip.  Cool whip.  Cool whip.  Stop pronouncing every single syllable.  Schenectady, New York.  You go watch this.  You dumb bee.  We got a lot to add to this list.  I hope people are paying attention to it.  We saw the soloist last night.  What the hell is going on here?  Did you watch the soloist?  That looks like a piece of shit.  I'm looking for blindness. 
[02:19:30]  Hold on, Rich.  The director who directed Children of God directed it.  But what I'm getting here is...  I'm not getting the people that you said were in.  Blindness movie.  Just put blindness movie.  Rich, did you like the soloist?  Well...  Oh, and no one had a name.  IMDB.  Dude.  Maybe it's called something else?  No, it's called blindness.  It's called blindness.  They can't find it.  Okay, wait.  It says first blind man, driver one, concerned pedestrian, thief, driver two.  Yes.  So there's no names.  No names.  No one's a name, but they have...  I'm trying to find the people you said with Danny Glover in it. 
[02:20:00]  Danny Glover.  Why is there no name?  No one has a name in it?  Because it's trying to be...  Look, the movie starts off with this.  All right.  Chinese man number one just goes blind driving.  And he's like, I'm blind.  Gets out.  A guy tries to help him.  He goes blind.  Ah, there it is.  Their eyes are almost shut anyhow.  It's a pandemic of blindness.  So it gets so bad that they lock...  The government gets a big old hospital and just puts everybody who's going blind in the 
[02:20:30]  hospital.  And it turns into rape, murder.  They make blind people look so fucking dumb.  Like, they're bumping into the...  Hitting their head.  Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.  Like, it's...  And all of a sudden, a guy gets a gun.  One of the blind people.  They chop him up into sections of area one, area two, area three.  Area three gets a gun.  And they're made up of rapists, killers, and murderers.  They were the ending.  So he got a gun, and he controls...  The blind killer controls the blind thing to the point where he controls the food and 
[02:21:00]  everything.  So they have to...  The blind people have to give all their valuables to this guy so they can eat food.  When they run out of valuables, they go, send your women.  So it's just nine blind women getting raped by 20 blind guys.  And one of them dies.  One of the women dies.  And the blind women carry her back to the...  It fucking...  You know that the suspension of disbelief, it goes to the highest levels of this, but 
[02:21:30]  it's poorly...  It is the worst fucking movie I've ever seen.  Blindness.  I can't tell you...  I've seen a lot of bad movies, but this one affected me how awful...  I just read the spoiler ending, too.  Why don't you rent Raging for it?  I saw it.  I had to.  I had to.  Yeah, I liked it.  Not like white people like it, but I knew Hawaii was good.  I'm telling you, dude.  Blindness.  You got to see this movie.  I don't fucking know.  Maybe.  Maybe if it's the worst movie ever.  Got to watch worst movie ever.  What?  Oh, it's Daryl? 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  Oh, good for Daryl.  He's a buddy of ours.  Come in.  He's in a commercial?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You got to promise you got to watch Blindness.  I'll see it.  And Lakeview Terrace.  No, Lakeview I want to see.  We saw that one.  I want to see Lakeview Terrace now.  You feel like they owe you money for wasting an hour and a half of your life for two hours.  Lakeview Terrace was terrible, man.  What the people that come in to see a boss show?  Wait, I thought you said Lakeview Terrace.  That's all right.  Rich is good.  No.  It was in the two worst ones I've seen.  Okay.  Do we have an update on Little Nicky? 
[02:22:30]  I have to know what's going on with Sam.  I just saw him, too, and he was looking nice and arrogant.  It looked like his life was on well today.  Someone else pointed something out that happened yesterday.  Maybe Travis could find the clip.  It might be a little while.  After E-Rock's beating, E-Rock, as he was leaving the studio, said, played the Little Nicky piece and walked out.  Oh, really?  If Travis could find that.  It was at the end of the E-Rail.  I know exactly what you're talking about.  Just give me a couple minutes so I can...  All right.  Let's have E-Rock in here.  I'd like to figure this out.  But still, Danny...  Where's Danny? 
[02:23:00]  I think Danny is light years intelligence ahead of Eric.  I think Danny...  Nothing Eric ever does should bother Danny.  So that's what's...  You know something's wrong.  You don't think Eric's bright?  You can see it in his eyes.  Get Dragonfly Brain in here.  You want to talk to him.  You know what it is?  You're right.  I'm not saying he's a fucking idiot.  He's got like a dairy cow eyes.  Yeah, it's just...  He's on fire.  He doesn't run.  He just stands there and moves.  You know I'm fucking a donkey.  You know you talk to somebody and you go, you do what I'm saying.  And you go, yeah, yeah, I get it.  Like you get the ultimate concept. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Eric looks like he says, huh.  Danny's got like...  Everything.  Danny's got like predator eyes.  And then E-Rock has like...  Yeah, like cow eyes.  Right.  It's just kind of like...  Like he would get hit by a car.  Chewing his cud.  If it was...  And waiting for somebody to just cut his head off and make steaks out of him.  Like an air conditioner might fall on his head.  Look at him.  Where's Danny?  Where did Danny go?  You have like innocent little cow eyes.  That's when he wakes up.  He wakes up in the morning and goes, huh?  Where did Danny...  Huh? 
[02:24:00]  Like he looks at the sun and, huh?  E-Rock.  E-Rock, where did Danny go first?  Patrice is implying that you're as stupid as a single-celled amoeba.  I'm not saying...  And I don't want to...  It's just you can see...  If I put a game of wits against each other, I would put Danny against Eric and I think  Danny would beat him with ease.  Like at chess without looking.  Like you can talk to another friend and you just go, okay, I see what you did. 
[02:24:30]  Like that's why I think Danny might be that much smarter than Eric.  So if Eric says anything and gets Danny fucking upset, then I know that Danny's...  Something's wrong.  Danny's off.  If Eric can get him at any point.  Comment, E-Rock.  Yeah.  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  I don't know, huh?  Well, Travis is looking for something.  What didn't you...  No, I didn't catch this.  No, I said at the end of, it was the segment with, I think when I was taking all the callers 
[02:25:00]  about being fat.  Yes.  And I was leaving.  I was like, all right, well, you know, play that little Nicky piece when you get a chance.  Now, you had heard it in prior.  Yeah, it's been sitting there for a while.  So we had it.  Yeah, we just didn't know what to do with it.  But I want to know, like, who told little Nicky anything.  Well, how about this?  I got the little Nicky response right in my hand.  Oh, okay.  Right in my hand, Sam.  And that's, that's...  I got a chance to interview little Nicky.  Yeah.  He, uh, used a filter over his voice. 
[02:25:30]  Why?  Oh, because that's what he does.  Well, I'd like to make it so it's not really him.  It's just, I mean, he's a production guy, so he has a production guy voice.  What the fuck's going on here?  All right, let's...  Do we have to do a Utah to Danny, too?  Danny's back in the room.  Yeah.  Where'd you go?  I spent in the office.  All right.  Well, I mean, you know.  No, because Patrice was talking to you, and then you got up and left.  Not talking to him.  Talking about him as if he wasn't here.  I was talking about him.  It went...  But do you see what he just did, like, as if that was that... 
[02:26:00]  Hey, where'd you go, Danny?  We know you left in some kind of weird something.  And where'd you go?  Ah!  What?  Coffee.  Like, something's going on, man.  You point out that E-Rock, he might be smarter than E-Rock.  Yes.  But look at E-Rock and look at him.  Who has a nicer heart?  Who's a better...  You know what I'm saying?  Who has the heart?  E-Rock is like one of those...  You know, he has no ego.  That's another thing.  He just comes in, takes a punch in the face, kind of goes back. 
[02:26:30]  Danny's...  Smart people, like...  I think Sam is to be the most, probably, most talented out of everybody.  In terms of...  You know what?  That's going to start.  And I know it's that.  But that's what people should hear.  Let the ego go.  Ego means ease and God out.  E-Rock can have a T-R-T.  Ah!  Hold on.  Oh, no.  Rich, what did you say?  Ego is ease and God out.  Shut up!  Fuck you.  Is it also, if you point at me, four point back...  No, I'm funny.  You're creep.  You know what I'm telling you? 
[02:27:00]  When you point at me, bro.  Three point back at you.  Three point at me.  No, they don't point.  They curl back from the pointing line.  No one points like this, okay?  How about somebody just makes a fist and points?  I think Patrice woke up this morning and decided to just ruin our show.  Just, like, completely break it apart and destroy it.  No!  What the fuck?  I'm driving and I'm fucking listening.  All right, Mr. Honest.  Stay relaxed.  You're driving.  Hold on.  E-Rock is about ease and God out.  E-Rock is a bigger scumbag than people make him out to be.  Yes, he is.  Like, you look at him like this gentle E-Rock that comes in and takes a lot of 
[02:27:30]  E-Rock can be an incredible scumbag.  A planning fucking piece of shit?  I think he can.  Yeah, yeah.  He's, like, very divisive.  So let me apologize then.  He's, like, internally.  Mars had a wonderful comment on that yesterday.  Did he?  Because he was, we were talking in the office and he was saying, I was saying something  about E-Rock.  Just let me be your mouthpiece from now on.  And he said something about, no, don't con man a con man.  Exactly.  But Mars goes like this.  It's Kaiser Sose.  No, Mars says.  He is Kaiser Sose. 
[02:28:00]  He is very, very two-faced.  And I don't mean that in a way where, like, you'll do something and then stab yourself in  the back or anything like that.  It's like there are the two faces of E-Rock.  One is this gentle little kid that walks around going, jeepers, I like working in radio.  And, oh, it's my turn of the bell.  And then the other one is this fucking guy that I can't even describe.  Kaiser Sose.  Oh, wait.  It's Sling Play.  Kenny's in.  Kenny.  Yeah, Sling Play.  I don't feel I got no reason to kill nobody. 
[02:28:30]  You got 20 or 30 more than potted cans of meat.  I need some potted meat.  If Eric was two-faced, he wouldn't be wearing that one.  Oh, Kenny swoops in with one.  He knew it was going to kill because he was waiting for it.  He waited for it.  Oh, they call him cannoli sotis.  He saw the skin face. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, he did.  Holy shit.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, he's Kaiser Roll.  Kaiser Roll, Sam.  Oh, my Kaiser Roll.  All right.  Back to Sam.  We got the little Nicky response.  Does this bring this whole thing together?  Oh, wait a minute.  I see the intelligence.  Hold on, hold on.  Wait a minute.  His eyes are moving.  Oh.  See, you know what? 
[02:29:30]  I've never really paid attention to these beatings.  Yeah.  But his eyes were moving in a, what am I going to do to destroy somebody's life?  Let me look her down.  Mr. Kaputnik.  Oh, shit.  Eric's smart because he just sits there and he'll shut up and just let everybody just  go off.  He won't say something back.  That's why Eric's smart.  That could be used against him later in a show of law.  Martin said when you look at Eric in the eyes, he goes, Eric, no offense or anything, but  like when you're trying to trick someone and they look at you in the eyes, they see you  coming like they know what you're doing. 
[02:30:00]  Because you can see he's tricking his, they're moving back and forth like the Knight Rider.  The scanner.  The scanner on the Knight Rider just, but you can see he's just thinking.  Yeah.  Well, that's hard enough.  Holy shit.  And he gives himself away whenever he's plotting and he's talking to you, he goes,  Oh, fuck me, man.  All right.  Kaiser sausage.  That's so funny.  Kaiser roll. 
[02:30:30]  I'm Kaiser so gay.  Kaiser.  Should we get to the little Nicky response or what?  Oh, it does.  Unfortunately, Kaiser barbecue sausage.  I'm sorry, man.  Come on.  Unfortunately, little Nicky's response does actually raise more questions.  Oh, is this a work? 
[02:31:00]  Is this like a wrestling work?  I wish.  Let's listen.  I wish.  Little Nicky, we just played your production piece about Danny.  What happened?  Dude, I did the, uh, you know, that replay.  He's got such a humor.  You got to give him that much.  He put it in a production voice.  He's got funny.  All right.  Hold on.  Fucking guy.  Little Nicky, we just played your production piece about Danny.  What happened?  Dude, I did the, uh, you know, that replay promo I did for you guys where I'm snuffing out 
[02:31:30]  a baby and has a hooker in the trunk and shit.  Yeah.  I got wind that he was talking shit about that promo and it's like, yo, dude, I don't  know you.  You don't know me.  Get to know me before you talk shit about things you know nothing about.  And if you can do a better promo, fucking do it and teach me something, dude.  I'm all up for learning something.  Who told you he was talking shit about it?  I'm not going to drop that down because I got a lot of friends on the ONA staff, but  let's just say the majority of them.  Oh, but there are people.  Oh, no, there's several people and there's no one to blame but me and Danny for being a 
[02:32:00]  douchebag about something he knows nothing about, dude.  I don't know you.  Don't be a dick about things if you don't know me.  He thinks that E-Rock is behind this.  It's not E-Rock's fault.  Yo, ONA, it's not E-Rock's fault.  It's all me.  Do you feel apologetic because...  No.  Fuck that guy, dude.  You don't know me.  You walk around here like your shit don't stink.  Fuck you, dude.  He was surprised that you had a problem with him because he said that you two had never  interacted.  All I needed was that one-sided interaction for me to be fucking balls to the wall, cutthroat. 
[02:32:30]  Hey, man, make something against me.  I'll fucking go at this again.  It was a lot of fun.  He said that he didn't think he was going to retaliate because you were just a production  guy.  Oh, just like he's just the guy who surfs the net and he's just a fag.  Well, I guess that's that, then.  Yeah.  Fuck you.  What the fuck?  I'm confused.  Holy shitballs, man.  First of all, let me point something out.  E-Rock is absolutely involved in this.  Because he said, was E-Rock involved? 
[02:33:00]  He goes, it's not E-Rock's fault.  That doesn't mean shit.  That means I think E-Rock is absolutely involved with Little Nicky.  Don't fucking say it was me, dude.  Please, you can't get me away.  I won't.  I'll throw him off the curve.  I'll throw him right off the curve.  It wasn't Eric's fault.  That's all I have to say.  Fart it in your face again.  It's going to fucking work.  Oh, it is so bad.  Come on, E-Rock.  Get to it.  Get to it. 
[02:33:30]  Sorry, guys.  What are you doing?  Put your mouth off.  All right.  Let's go.  It is like a waste treatment plant in here.  It's like when you drive past a waste treatment plant.  Go ahead.  I need the pressure from the E-Rock.  E-Rock, go ahead.  No, when we were in here last segment, I said he asked for production and I gave it to him.  He was already in the midst of making it.  Let me ask you.  Were you the guy that told Little Nicky that Danny was trashing his piece?  No, I was not.  He was poo-pooing his production piece.  No, I was not.  Then who fucking started this?  He said, Little Nicky said that it wasn't, Little Nicky did not hear Danny say it. 
[02:34:00]  He did not walk by.  He said several people.  Like we're getting wind of Jimmy's asshole.  He said multiple people from the O&A staff.  Danny, did you ever say anything bad about his production piece?  Not that I remember, honestly.  I don't remember saying anything about it, to be honest.  E-Rock says he didn't tip Nicky off, so who the fuck tipped him off?  I was needing...  Something that sounds like it never happened.  We need to know who that is.  I don't think it was...  I want to say stuff about it now. 
[02:34:30]  I think it was one person.  I think it was one person, and Little Nicky's being protective.  Yeah.  I think Little Nicky's being protective, so we can't try to narrow it down, personally.  But the bottom line, it's not who snitched.  It's the final battle.  Well, the thing is, there was only...  Between Nicky and him.  He's got a rebuttal to that guy.  Hold on.  He has to rebut.  Rebuttal.  He's got a rebuttal means he has produced something already.  He has to rebuttal means he's yet to do it.  He's got to do that, too.  If there was only one occasion where Danny might have said something about his production 
[02:35:00]  in the room right when he first was hearing it, it had to be whoever was in that fucking  room.  And who was in the room?  D-Boy.  Mathers.  Mathers.  D-Boy was in there.  I was in there.  E-Rock was in there.  Danny was in there.  Danny, of course.  He said it.  And there was one or two other people on the camera.  Were Steve in there?  I'm sure he was.  I think there were interns in there, too.  Oh, so interns might be ratting out the staff to other people.  Because I was playing the promo for Derek while he was playing the video game, and I 
[02:35:30]  was playing it off the computer.  And then what did Danny say about the piece?  Danny came in and said, what is this?  And Derek turned to him and he goes, no, dude, he's really good.  He's like the best.  He's not out there.  Production guy here.  And then what did he say?  That was the end of the conversation.  By the way, you were really able to recall exactly what Danny said.  Yeah, I thought you said you didn't know.  Very, very.  See, I never said I didn't know.  I said I didn't tell him.  I just tricked you with a lawyer trick.  I then asked you, I lulled you into this false sense of security and then asked you, 
[02:36:00]  what did Danny say exactly?  And you knew in a second exactly what he said.  Yes, I did.  Dum, da, dum, dum.  Dum, da, dum.  Huh?  Literally.  Here comes Rich.  Now, wait, what did he say?  What did he say?  If you ratted, would you just right now say, yeah, I did it?  You seem like the guy that was...  I would if it was me.  Yeah, so he would admit if he did it.  He seemed like the guy that would go, fuck it, yeah, I did it.  He wanted to have him a part in it when he asked for the production.  I said, yeah, I'll put you some stuff.  I think E-Rock knows more than he's saying, but I don't, but I still think that E-Rock... 
[02:36:30]  Derek has something to do with it.  But I don't think he's, I don't know what I'm saying.  You think Derek, the production guy...  Well, because Derek is the production guy for the show, and then you got little Nicky handing  in pieces, that might cause a little tension is all I'm saying.  Also, what was asked of you, E-Rock, as far as giving clips?  Did you ask, what do you need this for?  Or did he tell you what he was doing?  Derek came in, and peripheral vision Danny, he just got into character.  You should have stayed in the bathroom and fucking went into character before you came 
[02:37:00]  in and looked at Danny.  Crock didn't even look him in the face.  Sideways looked at him, Derek.  It's not easy to look in the face.  D-Boy, D-Boy Mathers.  Holy fuckballs, man.  I have nothing to do with this whatsoever.  This is collusion.  Do you know anything about it, though?  No, actually, I heard a rumor that it was going on, like what it was, but I wasn't  even allowed to hear it before anybody else, because everybody thought I was going to run  and go tell Danny.  But all really, but wasn't it, weren't you in there when it was being played and Danny  went like, you know...  Oh, wait, you're talking about that? 
[02:37:30]  That was the original piece.  I'm talking about the one that you guys played today.  Right, right, right.  That's what I mean, like the original piece.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You were in that room.  Yeah.  And you heard Danny say...  Honestly, I don't remember.  I have a feeling E-Rock and Steve teamed up on this one.  I think it could be an E-Rock.  And where's Steve?  Why is he avoiding the room?  Whatever conversation took place.  No, I was...  You know what?  Can I say something?  There's a saying.  I might have to apologize to Danny.  There's a saying that, what is it?  Fucking...  Just because I'm paranoid doesn't mean somebody ain't trying to kill me. 
[02:38:00]  Somebody ain't trying to get me, yeah.  It might be a fucking conspiracy against Danny.  Like the hypochondriac's tombstone that said, see, I told you I was sick.  Or like six or one half dozen of the other.  Here's the thing.  Burn the hand.  Six or one half dozen of the other.  What is he saying?  I didn't want to do this again, but now Voss brought it out of me.  No!  Like a skunk.  He just shot one at Voss like a skunk.  All right, we got Steve in studio.  Steve, what do you know about this?  For real.  I can happily say I have nothing to do with this. 
[02:38:30]  Everyone's saying that.  No, I did.  Someone has to know something.  This was a finished production piece.  I'm having nothing to do with it either.  Somebody told Little Nicky that Danny was not happy with the original production piece.  That's the bottom line here.  We got to find out who the mole is.  Now, what we want, listen to me.  Feet too fat for his shoes?  There's a couple.  I don't know.  It is good.  There's a couple.  Colon too rotten for his body.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, shit.  God damn. 
[02:39:00]  There it is.  My God.  I'm not used to smelling that unless it's on my dick.  He's making me feel bad about what I did here.  He's chewing it away because he doesn't want to get a boner.  Farts don't arouse me.  They just don't.  There's no secret that Danny and Steve don't get along.  We've got to question Steve a little more.  A little more.  It would make it obvious to everybody in the room to think that I had something to do with it,  but I didn't.  This was a finished production piece before I even found out that there was an issue. 
[02:39:30]  What did you think of the production piece?  What, his original one?  No, no.  The Nicky's.  The original.  The one we just heard.  The baby smothering one.  I loved it.  Now, how about this new one?  Well done.  You loved it.  Well done.  Can I ask a quick question?  We go to Patrice O'Neal, who's going to be at the Cleveland Improv.  Thank you, sir.  August 21st through the 23rd.  This weekend.  Can I ask a question, Ovi or either one?  Yeah, let's go.  Is there a competitive kind of spirit with the production stuff on this show? 
[02:40:00]  Everything is competitive on this show.  Meaning, are they competing with each other for their, who has the best pat on the back production thing?  Right, right.  As far as even a clown clip or something, yeah, there's always who got the best shit.  It's a lot of competition.  Okay.  All right.  I just wanted to get that.  Okay, that helps.  Yeah, so that makes everyone a suspect, really.  But Derrick's not in competition, though.  He's kind of just the guy that puts it together, right?  No, but Derrick could be a little bit of an instigator, but not that much.  He just shakes his head down. 
[02:40:30]  Not that much.  You're not in charge of content, right, Derrick?  You do other things, right?  He does production.  Yeah, mainly just production.  He's very good at doing production and drinking.  All right, hold on a minute.  Hold on.  There's another piece of this puzzle, possibly.  Could it be possible that Danny said something on air about the production piece?  Nick in Iowa.  Nick.  Yeah, how you doing, guys?  Hi, Nick.  Welcome aboard.  Go ahead, Nick.  Thank you.  I remember distinctly when you played the original piece the first time, that at the  end of it, everybody was all, hey, this little Nicky, that's great. 
[02:41:00]  That's great.  And somebody said something to Danny, and Danny's like, yeah, that's all right.  And I remember saying to myself, oh, he's opening a can of worms, because he's so competitive  about everything, and he's got such a thin skin.  I knew he wanted to get back to the Nicky.  That would explain a lot.  Get us the clip.  That'll solve it right there.  Get us the clip.  And a can of worms.  Not you, sir.  You can't get us the clip.  You don't work here.  That's right. 
[02:41:30]  What would David Caruso say about this?  Well, well, Frank, as far as production goes, we have to find out who produced this controversy.  Yeah, exactly.  What a fucking piece of shit.  Why wouldn't little Nicky just explain?  Can little Nicky come up with another voice?  Apparently a man of mystery.  Explain.  He's trying to keep his mystique.  Well, he's doing a good job. 
[02:42:00]  And he's nice.  And a lot of people have been saying he's the baddest motherfucker on the block.  I don't do production, but if I did, I'd take a crack at this fucker.  Because his arrogance is unwarranted.  And I think Danny, on top of his game, Danny and Sam working together would smash this kid.  And he has no fear of anybody in this goddamn room.  I want to hear the original clip now the first time we played it.  Let's go to Mark in New Hampshire as Travis tries to find that.  Mark?  Hey, I just wanted to clear, Steve, if that original clip was played on a Monday, 
[02:42:30]  there's no way here for anything to do with it.  I wasn't paying attention.  I was sleeping in.  Oh, wait, we got Rocco checking in.  Rocco.  Dude.  Hey, how you doing, everybody?  Hi, Rocco.  I did it.  I told Nick.  So, Rob a room could go back and go eat your thing and make your coffee and do what you need to do.  I was excited that it was going to be, dude, it was me.  I know.  But then he uses a regular voice.  Some guy pretending. 
[02:43:00]  I'm sorry I upset everyone.  Jesus, Danny.  Who do you want to hug in the room, Danny?  Everyone.  Let's just all have one.  There's so many people in here.  Eric and Sam and Steve and Derek and Patrice.  Who do you think is behind it, Danny?  What's your instinct tell you?  Dude, I don't know.  I mean, obviously.  Did you make fun of the piece?  Do you remember?  You wouldn't remember.  It was such a non-conversation for me to have.  I honestly don't remember.  Who retarded Elton John?  It just keeps popping up.  He's awful.  But, you know, if I did say something, I would love to be able to remember what I said. 
[02:43:30]  I don't.  I just don't.  It was such a non-issue for me.  I don't give a fuck if someone's playing a production piece when I walk into a room.  It's not a very important part of my day.  That might not be the time.  Obviously, it's important for other people.  It might be that you said something on the air.  It might be on the air, which is...  He either heard it himself or it got back to him.  That's all.  Whenever Travis had it.  You know what?  And it could be someone that has nothing to do with this that likes little Nicky a lot  that works in this building and let little Nicky know about it.  And I...  If you said something bad about it on the air, then it explains a lot. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  And it is fine.  You should be able to do that.  And you don't remember anything?  Dude, we do so much.  I mean, it was...  If...  I'm on Danny's side as far as that goes.  If he decided to slam it, it was just a throwaway.  We moved on to something else.  He said O&A staff.  He didn't say serious staff.  Little Nicky.  He said people on the O&A staff.  Get Troy Kwan in here.  Uh-oh.  Now, before I let Danny off, is it possible that this could be a little scheme between  Danny and... 
[02:44:30]  Little Nicky?  And Little Nicky.  No.  No.  No.  As a stunt.  No.  No?  Not even a chance?  Sam territory.  All right.  Just...  Oh, that's...  That's wrestling.  That's wrestling.  Fucking shit.  Can Danny be blacking out at work if he doesn't remember?  I know he said too much drinking.  It's certainly a possibility.  You can't tell that he has a drinking problem.  Huh?  You can't tell.  You can't tell...  It's amazing.  Somebody in this room is a fucking culprit.  I know.  There's a culprit.  Mars?  No, sir. 
[02:45:00]  I had nothing to do with it.  I know.  Yeah, Mars keeps his nose clean.  Mars is just happy he's in a building with electricity.  Oh, shit, man.  Winter's coming.  He wants to make sure he keeps this game.  He doesn't want to fuck this up, okay?  He actually sleeps on the wires like a fucking bug.  He can walk through a door to get into a building.  All right.  Ladies and gentlemen, Troy Kwan, who sort of works for the Opie and Anthony show, would  be considered ONA staff.  What do you know about the little Nicky Davis? 
[02:45:30]  Why do you dress like a heroin addict?  First of all...  You dress like a Lower East Side heroin addict.  First of all, this good-looking motherfucker wants to get rid of all these monks.  I know.  With his little brother's outfit.  Yeah, I heard the piece after it was done.  I didn't know what provoked the anger in little Nicky.  Yeah, I'm still confused by that myself.  You didn't say anything to little Nicky about Danny's...  I wasn't there when the piece was played for everybody.  Oh, okay.  Holy shit.  He went from me wanting to fuck him to...  He just...  He's retarded. 
[02:46:00]  What the fuck?  I'm like, I'm going to hang with this guy to get his second-hand pussy.  And he goes...  What the fuck happened?  Hey, you guys pulled me in here.  I have nothing to do with it.  This guy's going up in his head.  I'm like...  I'm like, pussy's going to rain out the sky.  God damn, man.  What the fuck?  God just doesn't give anybody the whole package. 
[02:46:30]  I thought you were going to go, look, I had nothing to do with the baby.  I got to go, I got to do my thing.  This bitch is waiting.  He's retarded like the Godfather Trump is.  Oh, my God.  God bless him.  Troy.  Guys, call me here.  Tell you my side of the story.  I honestly don't know what happened.  Is there anyone else we haven't interviewed from the O&A staff? 
[02:47:00]  Holy fuckballs.  Who the fuck else do we have?  Troy, don't go nowhere.  I'm sorry.  Don't mind me, man.  The interns.  You think any of the interns are all?  Would they be considered O&A staff?  I don't think the interns talk to little Nicky.  Who doesn't like Danny on the intern staff?  I mean.  All of them.  Where does Angry Mike stand on this whole thing?  Angry Matt.  Oh, Matt.  Angry Matt.  I just remember the angry part.  Angry Matt. 
[02:47:30]  Where is that kid?  In two seconds, he starts running for air time.  Here he comes.  Jesus Christ.  Patrice, this kid is always angry.  Oh, God.  He's going to have a fucking car.  He's going to have his bad side.  Look at the momentum he's building up.  He's the youngest kid to have a heart attack ever.  He's going to run a stump all day again.  Where's Wednesday?  Angry Matt.  Where's Wednesday?  Patrice just starts laughing.  Hey, Matt.  How many licks does it take to get to the center of a judging room?  Since you've been investigating all these years. 
[02:48:00]  Hold on a second.  And by the way.  He looks like.  He looks like.  With the eyes, boy.  He looks like.  Two different colored socks.  He's wearing two different colored socks.  No, they're the same color.  They're just one's been bleached.  Oh, Jesus.  I have a white trash.  Fucking dead left eye.  Why would you wear horizontal stripes on top of me?  I know.  This is fucking wrong, you know.  Because I have no fashion sense.  And I just don't give a shit.  No fashion sense.  See, he's angry.  I'm going to die right on the air. 
[02:48:30]  Angry.  I'm sorry.  Let me leave these guys alone.  Angry.  Let me apologize to Troy.  That was an attack on Troy.  What's your name again, Matt?  Troy's guy.  Sorry, Matt.  Angry Matt.  No, Troy.  Wow.  Go ahead, Matt.  Do you have any input on this?  Oh, shit.  Oh, by the way.  A lot of people are a little confused out there.  You've got to listen to the replay today.  I mean, it's too much going on to try to reset.  There's a big issue.  It started before Patrice got here and I think before Vos got here.  Listen to the replay and it'll all make sense. 
[02:49:00]  Yes.  Angry Matt.  He's a good kid.  What do you know on this?  I know absolutely nothing about him.  Another guy that knows nothing.  Everybody knows nothing.  You didn't hear anything about this going down.  That means we have to go back to Sam.  I think it's all Sam's.  I wouldn't be surprised if Sam was involved.  He looks like a good wrestling story, man.  Get out of fucking mess where your sons are bitches.  Look at Matt.  There he goes.  He wasn't as angry.  He was a little angry.  Go bleach your other sock.  He goes, it's not a different color.  It was bleach.  It's a different color. 
[02:49:30]  His fucking shoes cave in like internally.  His fucking shoes lean in like a house on a cliff.  That's what Patrice is just openly laughing at him.  He walked in.  Jesus.  Sam.  Oh, you motherfuckers are just wrong, wrong, and wrong, man.  You started the whole fucking thing.  Oh, fuck me, man.  We were moving on from the Danny thing, but then you had a little insight and now it's  all this, Patrice.  Oh, shit.  I'm sorry.  Sam.  Back to you.  What do you know?  Old story.  I found out about this piece weeks ago while it was being produced. 
[02:50:00]  That long ago?  Weeks ago?  Yes.  When I knew about it, Eric knew about it, and Troy knew about it.  After that, Steve found out, then Derek found out.  Why did anyone tell Danny?  Because we wanted his reaction on the air.  Okay.  Well, that makes sense.  Now, that would make me believe that one of you three that knew about it knew that he  was angry about the first piece from what he heard. 
[02:50:30]  That's when I found out.  While he was producing this piece, I said, why is he producing a Danny piece?  Again, this was weeks ago, and he said, and Troy and Eric said because he's pissed that  he found out that Danny was talking about him.  So, wait a minute now.  You found out Danny was talking about him.  Yes.  But, Iraq, you said that Nicky overheard something or something.  That's not true.  Because Nicky even said in that piece that somebody told him.  Right.  I know.  But who said that he overheard it?  He got wind of it.  Eric said that. 
[02:51:00]  Eric said he overheard.  Sam, to ask the question?  Yes.  What is the level of order that would not be able to get to Nicky to tell him?  Is there a cutoff point to the lowest levels where they can't talk to Nicky?  The interns wouldn't be able to get in there.  No, but all of us.  So, the interns would be out?  Out.  Yeah, they wouldn't.  They wouldn't.  They wouldn't.  They wouldn't.  They would be in the hallway.  So, this is actually ranking officers here.  Yeah.  The ass situation.  Yeah.  And how many ranking officers are there? 
[02:51:30]  This is it in the room?  Yeah, pretty much.  My gut feeling is...  Someone right in here is a fucking rat.  Wow.  Yeah.  They're not fessing up.  I think my gut feeling is that someone who doesn't like the show knows that Nicky's part  of our show told Nicky what...  That could be a fucking million people.  What possible?  Oh, absolutely.  I think it goes back...  Get all serious in this room right here.  Yeah.  I think it goes back that Danny might have said something on the air.  Probably.  Then I'd like to hear it.  And then it just blew up.  Travis has something to say.  Yeah.  I just listened back to it. 
[02:52:00]  Danny didn't say a single word about it.  Yeah, I never heard Danny say anything.  Really?  At the end of the bit...  If you want to listen to it, we can.  Do we comment on the bit at the end?  Yeah.  All right.  Let's listen to the end of it and us commenting.  On the virus, Sirius 197, XM 202.  That's little Nicky.  Okay, little Nicky.  That's little Nicky.  Out of his fucking mind.  That's little Nicky.  Holy shit.  His real name is Jerry.  And he's a...  Jerry!  They say he's the best production guy here at Sirius XM.  That is pretty goddamn funny.  And we need him to do some production for us. 
[02:52:30]  That was pretty damn good, right?  Anytime you're suffocating a small child.  Wow.  In production.  I thought Steve was angry.  Wow.  God bless little Nicky.  Jerry, actually.  And then we also had the blown home run call.  What the fuck?  Wow, okay.  So there's no indications.  You guys, you know, you contributed to his arrogance, though.  You contributed to his...  Oh, yeah.  We were praising him there.  Danny said something in the office.  Somebody in that office or some people in that office definitely told Nicky that Danny said it. 
[02:53:00]  Yes.  That's it.  That's what it is.  Someone's a rat.  Yes.  And now we can't trust anybody.  Who works in what office?  Oh, my God.  Look at everybody.  He's so serious.  I know.  Somebody's going to get fucking caught.  Wait, you thought you could trust people before today?  What are you, nuts?  Oh, fuck.  Okay.  Jesus.  The Xbox, which E-Rock said was being played by Derek when this was on, is in E-Rock's office.  E-Rock and Steve are in the Xbox office.  So, Derek was in the office with E-Rock and probably Steve, and Danny came in and said something. 
[02:53:30]  And said something.  So, there's your four.  I absolutely...  Now, Steve, wait a minute.  You're saying you didn't hear Danny say anything derogatory about the bit?  I didn't.  At all.  In Steve's defense, he doesn't pay attention a lot of times when people talk.  So, make a point.  It is true.  And then, um...  I mean...  So, the only other people that were in the office then was Danny, obviously.  And then...  Eric and Derek. 
[02:54:00]  Pitch McGillicuddy.  Pitch McGillicuddy.  He is sweating.  Uh-oh.  For the record, I am not sweating.  I have to think...  I think he's got a lot of alcohol on him right now.  I've got to just think it's E-Rock.  Eric could have told somebody...  Wait, E-Rock is definitely the shitster.  Because when he was getting abused yesterday, when he was leaving, he was like, play the  little Nicky piece.  Yeah, yeah.  So, he couldn't wait for that to be on the air.  We don't have any hard-hitting evidence, but it's close enough to keep an eye on you.  Okay. 
[02:54:30]  Yeah.  Until something comes through, yeah.  It's like first 48.  Did you guys say anything about little Nicky on Live from the Compound?  Let's just throw that out there.  Okay.  Oh, no.  Just have to make sure that's out there, too.  Not that I remember anything we say on that program.  All right.  I don't think so.  Shit, I'm starting to think it might be Eric, man.  It is Eric, I think, but I don't care.  I'm thinking it's Eric.  Have you said anything, Danny, about little Nicky?  Maybe not about the production piece?  Maybe somewhere else.  Like, maybe it got wind that it wasn't the production piece he did, but like, yeah, it 
[02:55:00]  was something else that he did.  Like, you might have...  See, we're constantly on the production piece.  You might have bad-mouthed him about something else to somebody else, and it got back to him,  and then he just attacked you in a production piece.  Well, that's a good point, Jimmy.  Yeah, it doesn't have to be about that.  It has nothing to do with the original production piece.  It may not have anything to do with that.  Well, no, the way little Nicky was talking, it sounded like it was bad-mouthing.  I know.  Hold on.  Kenny piped up and took his glasses off.  Yes, a waiter shirt.  Jesus.  What, Kenny?  You guys are overthinking this, because sometimes you can't see the forest through the trees. 
[02:55:30]  That's true.  We can see the idiot at the microphone.  Hold on.  Kenny, you were a detective for many years.  Yes.  What's your gut of listening to this?  You've been listening to this for the last two hours?  I'm staying out of this.  What's your...  Oh, he knows something.  Who do you think?  I love this song.  You know, I got no problem with Danny, but I still love this song.  But who do you think is responsible for letting...  I was just...  I was just fucking thinking of that shit. 
[02:56:00]  Wait a minute.  He keeps saying how much he loves this song.  Holy fuck.  What a twist.  You took that shit out of my head.  I'm like, holy shit.  He's smiling way too much.  Did little Nicky write the lyrics for that?  Yes.  He did, okay.  Wrote it, sang it, produced it.  He deserves a grandit.  Kenny, why are you so happy about...  This show is a cancer.  Everybody is...  It goes after everybody.  Oh, shit.  Oh, Kenny. 
[02:56:30]  Oh, Kenny.  He's got a plan.  Kenny likes to gossip in the hallways.  He knows everybody here.  Do you talk with little Nicky at all off the show?  I never said a word to him until I congratulated him and complimented him on making that song.  So you had no contact with him before that?  Negative.  All right.  You like that song?  I love it!  What the fuck?  Should we play the song again?  Yeah, let's all sing along. 
[02:57:00]  It's Kenny.  Come on, Kenny.  He's doing this.  Dude, what's up?  Kenny, what's up, man?  What's the haps?  Yeah, I have a feeling Kenny's not being honest, unfortunately.  I mean, he says he doesn't have a problem with me.  He says, you know, that we're fine and he enjoys me.  But I think that Kenny has a problem with me for some reason.  Oh.  Kenny?  It just goes to prove what a pro I am because I'm very convincing. 
[02:57:30]  Patrice is looking at Kenny in total disbelief.  We all are.  I think Kenny is the shitster.  He started this whole fucking thing somehow.  It could be.  Dude, he socializes with every single person here.  He doesn't know anyone.  He knows people I've never met before.  We are talking about how he just wanders around and chats with people.  I'm like the Secretary of the State of the Opie and Anthony show.  Secretary of the State.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah.  It looks like that.  That's right.  I spread goodwill wherever I go.  All right, Patrice.  Hold on.  Let's do some odds here. 
[02:58:00]  What is it, E-Rock?  What are the odds it's E-Rock?  Since Kenny came in here.  I'm down to three names right now.  E-Rock, Sam, and Kenny.  Sam wants to uncover this too badly for it to be him.  He's having such a good time.  So he's a long shot.  Yeah.  Okay.  Eric is...  Now that Kenny came in, I would have said Eric, but Kenny...  I might have to say Kenny.  Because one thing, Kenny doesn't give a fuck about anybody being upset with him. 
[02:58:30]  Kenny never gets his stuff.  Of these guys.  No, he doesn't care.  And you'll never be able to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt.  Look, burden of proof is on us.  I will say, Kenny really doesn't care if someone's mad at him.  No.  He doesn't give a fuck.  Hold on.  Not even a little.  Not these guys.  Hold on.  Kenny never gets excited either.  I sat next to him at the UFC 101.  He barely blinked.  And the excitement he's showing today means that something's going on.  No.  This is why I love this show. 
[02:59:00]  This is entertainment.  Who's stuck in your car now listening to this and won't get out?  Because they don't want to miss a word.  Danny believes it to be Kenny now.  Danny?  He believes it to be Kenny.  Danny's giving a look.  It's definitely Kenny.  It's Kenny.  It's obvious.  Do you have a problem with Danny, Kenny?  No.  Never.  Why don't you look at him?  What?  Look at him.  It's over there.  What did Danny do to Kenny?  Now I need to know this. 
[02:59:30]  Nothing.  I love Sam wants to try, man.  But if Kenny's the one that told Nicky somebody had to tell Kenny because the exchange with  Danny in the office happened after the show, Kenny's never here after the show.  You're right.  You leave it out.  So your theory is flawed.  So there is a co-conspirator, even if it was Kenny, which leads me to believe it's  not Kenny.  I still am with E-Rock.  Kenny's enjoying the fact that E-Rock's got some guilt here.  I would definitely bring E-Rock down for questioning. 
[03:00:00]  And his sweat stains are drying up.  I think E-Rock's hate towards Danny, he would admit it.  I think he would come out and go, yeah, I did.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Danny, why does Kenny not like you, you think?  I don't know, man.  I just get like, well, you know what?  I started getting a vibe like back when we were still doing the CBS show because Kenny  would always like to, he would always like to have fun with Sam and he never wanted to  have any fun with me.  Well, Sam is a fun, fun little guy.  We sat like four feet away from each other.  He'd always go, hey, Sam. 
[03:00:30]  Fun interaction, fun interaction.  Kenny likes twinks.  Yeah.  I've got enough fun to go around for everyone.  You don't like Danny's bubble butt?  What's wrong with his bubble butt there, Kenny?  No, let me see.  I like big butts and I can't deny it.  Today, sir, Mix-a-Lot's birthday or something or when he died or something.  What the fuck is wrong with him?  I can't believe I'm watching this, man. 
[03:01:00]  I'm going to be driving you to work soon.  What's that?  What's that?  What's that?  What's that?  Oh, my God.  What's the fuck?  Holy shit.  I'm here with all my friends on the radio.  We're doing a show.  Whoa, we got something else going on.  Kick to the uterus from Michigan writes, Opie, earlier you said Kenny hadn't done any new pieces.  This is with Troy Kwan, and he said, just wait.  Damn!  Uh-oh.  Oh, shit.  What?  But that was after this was played.  That was after this was played, I think. 
[03:01:30]  All right.  Should we go to break?  I got to pee back ladders about things.  We'll take this when we come back.  Absolutely.  We'll figure it out.  We can't let this one go.  Danny, can we play the piece in question again?  It's not the Danny and Anthony show.  I don't want to do whatever you want.  I'm out of respect.  A lot of people haven't heard it, so it is a good piece, even though it's not nice to Danny.  So, Little Nicky produced this because he thought I was talking shit about him for some reason.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's whatever, dude.  I mean, if you want me to criticize the piece, I'd be more than happy to do it.  You want to criticize the piece after the break? 
[03:02:00]  Yeah!  How about this?  We play the piece.  Because I'm sick of everybody trying to decide whether or not I...  You want me to say something about it, I will, and then it just could be over with.  Focus.  Here we go.  Break.  Play the piece after the break.  You comment about the piece.  Yes.  No one's leaving.  Perfect.  No, wait, wait.  The original piece?  The original piece.  All right, no, he's...  Oh, the original piece?  Yeah.  Because that's what started this whole thing.  That's what's starting the whole controversy is that I said something about his fucking piece,  so I'll fucking say...  I'll say something about it.  All right, let's do that.  All right.  So we'll play Little Nicky's piece now, then.  Fine.  Yeah, this is in retaliation to something I said about one of Little Nicky's production pieces. 
[03:02:30]  And then we'll play the original piece after the break, and Danny will comment about it  for real.  Yo, it's a Little Nicky joint featuring P.E.  Yo, Danny, no one ever talked before.  Never even met you, man.  But still, fuck you!  Danny is a fag, fag, fucking douchebag, fag, got a ponytail, hoops like a she-mail.  Danny is a fag, fag, fag, fag, fag, fag, fag, fag, fag, fag, fag, fag, fag, fag,  fag, fag, fag, fag, fag, fag, fag, fag, fag, fag, fag, fag, fag, fag, fag, fag, fag, fag, fag, fag, fag, fag.  I have sex with my guy friends.  He's a homo.  Sex with my guy friends. 
[03:03:00]  Guy friends.  We're homos.  Razzle, dazzle.  And he's balding.  I wonder what kind of mortis they have.  In his 20s.  Oh, jeez.  How'd you get here, Danny?  I'm not good at anything.  Did you ask your mommy?  Mommy, can I be on the Yopi and Anthony show?  Of course you can, honey. You're a homo.  Danny, what you drinking? Your breath is always kicking.  Maybe it's the cock that you've been homo.  Licking, licking.  She wanted Austin Powers. Instead, she got Ed Powers. 
[03:03:30]  Homo.  Danny likes to butt fuck. Fat dude's name Chuck.  And he's got his balls tucked. Here's a random duck.  And he's always drinking. Puking in the sink in.  Drinking from the cup that he pussed, pussed, pissed in.  Look at him drink. He's an alcoholic.  Buy him a drink. You can get your balls wet.  Fill up his cup. Fucking fuck him in the butt.  But wouldn't even care now. Come in his hair now. 
[03:04:00]  Come.  Come.  Danny is the fag.  Fucking goosebag.  Hot ponytail.  Looks like a sheenmail.  Danny is the fag.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[03:04:30]  Busy day.  Busy day.  Holy crap  All right, we got  Will this show survive  It's a vacation  I know  We got to get Danny  Where's Danny?  We got to get Danny  I'll get Kenny in here  And we got to get  We got Samuel  We have to get  E-Rock and  Dunn Steve  I don't know how much else  We can do on this  Well, he's got a list  Yeah, Danny's gonna  Yep, we know that  And then rip it apart, apparently  Yeah  I don't know  Maybe he'll compliment it 
[03:05:00]  Does Butcher have anything  To do with this?  No  Oh, man  You mean the show in general?  Yeah  Did you just say that?  Yes, I did  Listen to the replay  You weren't on mic  Sure was  You turned and you were  Looking at Sam  Did you hear me?  No  Of course you did  Well, because he has  One headphone on  All the guys heard me  I just barely heard it  This is so funny  I'm not gonna get this  Even all weekend  When I'm at the  Lakeshore Theater  I'm gonna be thinking  About today's show  Really?

[03:07:30]  Okay, that's the original  And Danny swears  He never commented  About this  That stinks  But now  Now Danny's gonna  Comment about it  Danny  What's the point of  Having all this  Controversy  If I don't talk shit  About it now  But do you like it?  I thought it was good  The production is fine  The production is fine  Oh, just fine  It's good  It's very good  That was a problem  Yeah  It's delicious  The choice of words  Fine  But since  But you know  Since obviously  I  You know  Whatever I said  Was bad enough  To warrant  Some two minute  Production piece  I'll say that 
[03:08:00]  It's trying to be  A little too extreme  To the point  That it's  It's almost  It's kind of hacky  Because we're  An extreme show  So the  Wow sticker promo  Has to have  Hookers in a trunk  And drugs  And smothering a baby  So there you go  That's all I have to say  The production is fine  It's put together nice  The guy obviously  You know  Knows what he's doing  And mixes well  And you know  Basically Danny  Says hi  But a little  Too much like the shit  We usually goof on  Yeah  It's like  You know  How many times  How many  How many production pieces  Are we going to go through  Where you know 
[03:08:30]  There's some kind of  Killing a hooker  3752  Yes  And you know  Killing a hooker  And smothering a baby  I mean it just reeks of  Of every production piece  I've ever heard  Reeks of every  That's trying  That's trying  That's trying  Yeah that's trying  To be extreme  And like oh  This has to  Oh it's a  It's a shocky  Jockey kind of  You know  Morning show  Oh we got to have  The extreme drugs  And drinking  That's weak  That's a weak argument  Danny  Weak  I don't know  I see what Danny's saying  Now  I see what Danny's saying  Chiming in

Chocolate chip  Oh no  Just going for the  Sanford and Son thing  Just throwing it out there  Oh no  That's the old bit  From yeah

[03:19:30]  Is she on meth?  How's the game?  Holy fuck  It's loosening up  Thank you  I see you think that  You enjoy that production piece a lot  The song?  Yeah  Can I hear the song?  Is it possible?  We played it  We played it  Yeah  Into commercials last time  Oh did it?  Okay  Why don't we do this?  So we're having a discussion  About the cookie monster  Now maybe Rush was inspired  By another famous overeater  Cookie monster  You know 
[03:20:00]  He swore off binge eating  Three years ago  He now snacks on carrots  And apples  These days  He's even part of  A new public service  Announcement on a healthy living  Come on  It's cookie monster  It's ridiculous  I don't think it's ridiculous  At all  It's ridiculous  No little child  Who is supervised  Under their parents  Is that James Cagney?  Go into  Whoopie  That is fucking  What happened to Whoopie's voice? 
[03:20:30]  Whoopie's voice?  Leave Muggsy  What's his name?  Goldberg  Fuck me  Muggsy  Woodberg  What?  I got confused  Shut up  Shut up  Muggsy  She sounds like fucking Danny Glover now.  What the fuck happened to Whoopi Jover? 
[03:21:00]  Whoopi Armstrong.  Whoopi Armstrong.  I see.  I see.  I see skies.  I see rush.  I bet you could.  I see.  Fucked up right now.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, no.  Oh, yeah.  What the fuck is wrong with Whoopi's voice? 
[03:21:30]  People are asking, how did you guys not smash Vos for saying Al Marosa?  I didn't even catch it.  We all caught it.  We're just tired of the coin.  Al Marosa.  Al Marosa.  Yeah, who the fuck remembers what her goddamn name is?  Who cares?  Back to this day.  Supervised under their parents.  Go into the cookie thing and go.  Yes, they do.  They're being supervised.  And we see how many parents supervise their kids.  They're just fucking. 
[03:22:00]  Just fucking.  Four broads trying to talk.  Just cackling, yapping.  Fucking hens.  What a nightmare.  Shut up.  I guess, you know, Whoopi was saying, it doesn't matter.  They should have the Cookie Monster eat cookies.  Yeah.  She's right.  And then one of the other ones were like, no, it should eat the carrots and vegetables.  Who is that?  Sherry Shitbird?  Is she the one that chimes in?  I don't know.  Shitbird.  Were they smashing lunch?  What the fuck?  I don't think that it is.  She's not like Scott Farrell. 
[03:22:30]  Wow, Ricky.  Let's pitch this as a male view.  Mr. McGillicuddy.  Opie, build a studio.  Let's just fucking do the male view, man.  Let's just do it.  Let's film it ourselves.  That's it.  And sell it to somebody.  We'll call it Guy Talk.  Guy Talk.  Yeah.  Extreme, but just with an X-Treme.  Is there a worse name than Guy Talk?  No.  The show comes on live after the view, and it's us just trashing the view.  Just trashing the view.  Doing rape jokes.  Fucking bitches.  Oh. 
[03:23:00]  You know, throw a video up online, it'll do very well.  Us doing that very thing.  But it's not Cookie Monster's fault.  It is not Cookie Monster's fault.  All right, what the fuck's going on?  So they don't want the Cookie Monster eating the cookies because it's bad for the kids to see this shit?  So that's what they did on Sesame Street.  They made the Cookie Monster start eating healthy.  Oh, Jesus.  What?  Yeah, yeah.  It doesn't eat cookies anymore.  Doesn't eat cookies anymore.  Shut up.  It's healthy food.  Is that right?  That's the real story? 
[03:23:30]  That's the real deal.  So now, Whoopi is saying that's ridiculous because it's...  It is ridiculous.  But someone is actually in there.  One of these fucking bitches, these hens cackling birds is in there saying that it's a good idea.  And Whoopi's going, well, if you're supervised, you're a parent, and you're supervised, the kid isn't going to grab handfuls of cookies and start shoving them in the mouth.  And then the other one's argument is, well, have you seen?  A lot of parents don't supervise their kids.  So it's Sesame Street's fault, and they have to raise the children, I guess, to be healthy. 
[03:24:00]  Isn't that the Cookie Monster eating fucking vegetables?  Well, that's what Whoopi said, but she said it like that.  It's like...  Cookie Monster's fault.  It is not Cookie Monster's fault.  He's changing in reflection to what's going on today.  That's the Sherry Shepard shit bird.  That fucking...  Who thinks the Earth is...  What does she think?  She thought the Earth was flat.  She lives in my building, and she's a lump.  She's a walking scooter pod.  She lives in your building?  She did.  Does she speak to you?  She said hi. 
[03:24:30]  What was the other thing she said?  She believes that, what, the Earth started with the...  Yeah, yeah, that the Earth started...  6,000 years ago.  So, that's stupid horse shit, strict to the Bible nonsense.  And there were no dinosaurs and stuff like that?  Just fucking menopause.  She hasn't seen my act.  That's just unreasonable.  That's unreasonable.  That's a dinobore.  Unreasonable.  Anybody who believes that fucking...  Just that believes Adam and Eve star...  They're just unreasonable.  Dinosaurs didn't exist. 
[03:25:00]  It's unreasonable.  I don't talk to people that...  Well, you're saying dinosaurs did or didn't exist.  Dinosaurs, of course, existed.  Yeah, they existed.  Because I wouldn't understand the plot.  Wow.  But there's some people who go...  I knew that.  Dinosaurs didn't exist.  Yeah, they didn't exist.  It's just unreasonable.  I don't want to talk to them.  That's not it, Rich.  And there was a big arc made, and one guy got all the animals on there.  It didn't get an arc, and then it landed on his back.  And we all...  And everybody...  Everything died except for two of everything.  Yeah, yeah.  When I just saw some molestate just discovered yesterday, they're like, just shut the fuck up. 
[03:25:30]  Anybody who says they don't believe in dinosaurs, I don't need...  I just walk away from them, because it's just too unreasonable to start with.  Yeah.  I think that's the way it happened.  Oh, yeah?  Really?  I certainly do.  What?  And that dumb bitch thinking the world is flat.  She didn't know the world was round.  Who said who?  A sphere.  Sherry Shepard.  Sherry fucking douche.  She's a big.  She's a blithering idiot.  She really blithering?  She actually thought...  She goes, I haven't had time to think about that, is what her answer was.  Do we have that time to look at every picture of the Earth from out of space? 
[03:26:00]  They have no clue.  Right.  There are people that don't look at pictures from out of space.  Don't know about the planet.  Don't know about anything.  They don't understand light refraction.  Right.  The cruise you go on, they just turn the boat around.  Yeah, that's all they do.  We'll just fall right off the edge of the Earth and sea monsters get you.  And, Patrice, you forgot you did Tough Crowd.  That was the male version of the view.  Oh, you got it?  All right, let's listen to this.  Here's that clip.  They threw it in a dumpster.  Here's that clip of the...  Is the world flat?  Is the world flat?  Yes.  I don't know.  What do you think? 
[03:26:30]  I never thought about it, Whoopi.  Is the world flat?  I never thought about it.  You never thought about it?  No, because I...  But I'll tell you what I thought about, how I'm going to feed my child.  I'm going to feed my family.  The world...  Is the world flat has never entered into...  That has not been...  What will you teach?  You'll teach your son, Jeffrey, right?  My son, Jeffrey, asked me if the world flat.  I guess I will go...  You know, didn't...  My husband's already worked this question out.  I mean, why are we doing this?  I'm mad.  I don't understand how Joy Behar deals with these idiots. 
[03:27:00]  I've met Joy Behar thanks to Rich, and she's a really...  She's very cool.  This is how you're going to feed your child.  She used to be.  With WIC checks.  That's how you can feed your kids.  Yeah, yeah.  She was a big-time, like, comic dude.  She's very funny.  But you get...  What happens is you get serious.  You get serious, man.  At some point in your life...  But if you have a TV show and she says that, you should escort her off the set and show  her the back door and slam her in her face and go, beat it, stupid.  As a comic, you would laugh.  You hope you meet somebody that says the world is flat. 
[03:27:30]  So you could just say you're stupid.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Of course.  But when you start becoming, like, whoopee and Joy, they're becoming self-important.  Yeah.  And you get like that when you start thinking that what you do is not as important as it  should be, you discover something important, and then now it's like, my whole life is sharing  importance.  When I start getting into the whole Newer Order shit and the banking and all, you get  so serious, you start wanting to quit everything and just tell everybody about that. 
[03:28:00]  And you're like, what the fuck am I doing?  Like, I can still be funny.  Yeah, yeah.  But as soon as you find God, and I don't know what the correlation between God and not  funny is.  Not funny.  God, you know.  It's unfunnyism.  But as soon as you find God, no more fucking funny for you.  So Joey Behar should love the fact that Sherry's dumb enough to say that so that she can just  have fun every day.  Jump on her.  Yeah, but they, you know what?  I think she gets told to hold back a little bit.  She can take it.  Yeah, because she's funny, and I've seen her try to, like, smash them, and they don't even  know how to take a smashing on that shit at all. 
[03:28:30]  But, I mean, can we get back to the original thing with that thing?  No, no.  She didn't fucking know if the world was flat.  But, you know, I feed my...  Yes, she tried to throw yours with her.  I know how to feed my kids.  Well, maybe you'd feed your kids better if you were educated and knew the world was round  a spear.  So what side of the flat earth does corn grow so you can feed your fucking stupid kid?  You're an asshole, Chevy?  Well, now you've got to be raising a dummy because you can't even help them out with 
[03:29:00]  schoolwork and answering questions.  She's on fucking TV, and I've got 30 people in Allentown.  Yeah.  It's fucking unbelievable.  I know.  I can't believe you brought that many in.  When the sun rises, it says, it's the world flipping like a pancake onto the other side.  And it just instantly gets light out.  And then it instantly gets dark again.  It's fucking...  She's an asshole.  It's a rotating pancake.  So you think she didn't want to answer the question because she didn't want to know?  She honestly did not know. 
[03:29:30]  And she felt like, oh, if I get the wrong answer here, I'm fucked.  I think she thought the world was flat.  Jesus Christ.  That is so crazy.  Like, how the fuck do you not know?  1486 is when the last person thought the world was flat.  And he was hung.  Yeah, yeah.  And then after that, it was fucking Columbus.  And so fucking six, seven hundred years ago.  How many people, let's just go with this country, think the world is flat?  Three.  Two. 
[03:30:00]  Two or three?  Three and a half.  That idiot on TV.  She counts as two plus one more.  That fat bitch and one more person.  And one more.  And a kid with a pink rose haircut eating pennies somewhere.  One more retard.  Yeah, not even ten people.  Not even ten.  Not even ten.  Let's get to the rest of this, to the end of the Cookie Monster thing.  Cookie Monster's fault.  He's changing in reflection to what's going on today.  It's bull.  And these kids, look at this cookie monster, shuffling cookies in his mouth. 
[03:30:30]  And I think they look at that and they are in fire.  It is not bull.  I got a kid.  I got a kid.  I got a fucking kid.  You're right.  This sucks.  First of all, American children are fatter now than they've ever been.  Right.  There's almost an epidemic of obese children.  And what?  Because we've gotten this health kick and putting nutritional information on everything and having  the Cookie Monster eat vegetables?  When you were a kid, it was your mother going, put that down. 
[03:31:00]  No.  Could I have a cookie?  No.  Go fuck yourself.  Go out and play.  It was good parenting.  Yeah.  I mean, Sheldon Shepard's no fucking twig.  No.  She's a fucking wildebeest.  No wonder her kid's going to be fucking a fatty.  She's a what, Rich?  Yeah.  Wildebeest.  Oh.  They said Wildebeest.  Wilder.  A wild and steam.  It's so fucking believable.  People just expect everyone else to raise their kids.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If you have a kid.  I mean, Rich, you raise your kids.  Yeah.  It's hard work, right?  And we let them eat as many cookies as they want. 
[03:31:30]  Fuck them.  We give them cookie dough.  Rich has his own grandkids.  Rich has adult women and a small baby to raise.  You made your own grandkids.  He made his own grandkids.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  My kids.  How does that feel?  Fuck.  My kids are in good shape.  They're good kids.  Tell them.  Hey.  He has nothing.  And listen to me.  See the pictures.  I used to take him to fucking whatever.  Someone is saying that Sarah Payland.  They're attractive daughters.  What am I going to say?  I got good kids.  Are you going to get mad at me?  No, I'm very hot.  Not bad.  You have good genes and you got good looking daughters? 
[03:32:00]  Yeah.  I'm going to get mad at me.  They're getting really fucking hot.  You got any new daughters?  Yeah.  You got a recent picture?  No.  No.  Come on.  Let me see.  In my mind.  Yeah.  I saw last night.  I mean, two nights ago, I took him out for yogurt.  Right?  Yeah.  And then we went out for food.  They are fucking good looking kids.  They really are.  Do you get pissed off when guys look at their asses and stuff when they're walking by?  I'm fucking trying to make cash.  Well, that's why he wants him to eat all the cookies they want. 
[03:32:30]  I want to fatten them up so the guys aren't.  You fucking did.  They got gorgeous kids, man.  I remember when they was fucking eight or some shit.  They were grown.  I was at her game yesterday.  My youngest one.  Her championship game.  Their fucking team stinks.  They were up by ten points and they didn't score the last.  They lost the game by fucking six.  What is your baby?  Two?  Two, man?  No, my 17-year-old.  No, no, no.  Your baby.  Yeah, she's two.  A 17-year-old.  Jesus, dude.  He has a two-year-old kid he just had.  And a 19-year-old, a 17-year-old, and a two-year-old.  I really need the improv to start using me again. 
[03:33:00]  Yes, I'll tell you about my two-year-old.  I said, let me tell you about my 17-year-old.  What did you feel about your Martin Lawrence thing?  I didn't see it.  Uh-oh.  What did you think of Patrice?  Oh, shit, Patrice.  Not Voss, but it just...  Well, the audience, well, the girl, you didn't see the part where the girl...  They were fucking heckling, but they kept that in.  You didn't see the part where the girl stood up.  But they cut her out and kept you fucking arguing with the bitch with not showing her.  Oh, really? 
[03:33:30]  Is that the First Amendment comedy thing?  Yeah, the girl stood up.  She was saying something to me, and I said to her, it was all black audience, I said to  her, I go, do you really think there's any fucking fear the second I walk down here?  That's what they show.  He sounded like a raven lunatic.  They put him on and sounded like he was crazy, but they didn't show why he was saying...  And then the lady, like I said, I called her, I go, you, you know, you assy bitch.  You know...  But tell him, but why did she start doing that?  He's making himself a victim.  No, no, let me tell you what happened first.  I saw it, fucker.  No, I was there. 
[03:34:00]  It was me.  He said that Baltimore is an awful city unless you're a chalk outline.  And this woman's son was just shot.  No, but that's not what happened.  So just fucking tell the truth, though.  Well, that's how it...  She stood up and...  Why are you going to a comedy club?  No, it was a TV show.  But wait, she was fucking snapping.  I told this, I told the story.  I told the story.  She stood up and said whatever, and then I fucking smashed her, and then she said, my  son just got shot and killed at the train station.  Then I said, well, do you think a comedy show is where you're supposed to be? 
[03:34:30]  Or I said, and I also said, maybe he jumped in front of the train to get rid of you,  or to get away from you.  Was the crowd going, oh...  Yeah, they were going, oh, because in D.C., people get shot all the time, so it's not  a laughing matter.  So then I said, how the fuck am I supposed to follow your son getting shot?  What can I do now but light myself on fire and run around the room?  And they showed that, but not the thing.  They just showed you defending yourself against no one against a group of black people that 
[03:35:00]  were going, oh, because the set started out really good.  Why would you accept that?  They offered me that show.  Why would you?  I always said no.  Why would you accept that?  Why?  I won't do it.  Because I won't do it.  Well, first of all, the set was going good, except one girl was sitting in the front row,  like, very agitated or something.  You know what I mean?  Like, oh, fucking whitey.  And then...  I just won't face that racial aggression.  I won't do it.  It was a good taping until the lady... 
[03:35:30]  It's a clever editing to mess it up.  Dave, I didn't see it, but I don't give a fuck.  Dude, they edited Voss.  Voss was defending himself against nobody.  He sounded like a raven lunatic.  Oh, my God.  It was fucking believable.  Let's get to the end of the Cookie Monster clip.  Oh, we still like the Cookie Monster.  Well, then why would you send me out and go, do you think your star set was good?  First of all...  No, I asked.  Dude, he was defending you.  No, no, he...  I asked him, did you see it?  And what did you think about it? 
[03:36:00]  Because I was upset with what they did.  Oh, I wouldn't have been out of my fucking mind if I would have saw that.  He's defending you.  Oh, thank you.  Jesus.  I got a kid.  I got a kid.  I got a kid.  I'm sorry.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  I have three grandkids who grew up with Cookie Monster.  They, not one of them, not one of them was affected by the way this puppet was eating.  That's why I'm sorry.  Sesame Street, if you know anything about it, is geared, okay, then you know that what they 
[03:36:30]  do is geared to looking after your child's health, your child's well-being.  They have not put in.  Which is why I'm glad they're doing that.  This is ridiculous.  I'm glad they're doing that.  It's why I think it's stupid.  I don't think it's stupid.  They're trying to make a point that cookies will make you obese, correct?  No.  No, that it's not healthy.  It's not healthy.  Why is it not healthy?  If it's not healthy, the way that he's eating it, that it's shoveling it.  They make Cookie Monster obese.  That's right.  That's right.  Make him obese.  They're trying to show a healthier alternative. 
[03:37:00]  It's a puppet.  It's a puppet is right.  Shady Shepard is fucking a worthless cookie monster eating garbage.  The kids are going to just start sucking dick.  It's the way he eats the cookies.  I get it.  Who's Mike Seeger?  Oh, Mike Seeger.  Who is he?  What do you call him?  Bob's brother?  Yeah.  Don't know.  Just tuned in.  Not sure if you guys covered that Mike Seeger died.  Who the fuck's Mike Seeger?  Do you know? 
[03:37:30]  Let's Google him.  Is that a biggie?  Let's Google him.  I have no fucking idea.  It's a bigger, big one if you're Mr. and Mrs. Seeger.  Shovel, please.  Nice.  What?  We saw a great video of a guy with a shovel in his head.  It was pretty bad.  You Googling him?  I'm going to try.  I love that comedians pretend they don't know, like understand the internet.  You guys know the Google?  I know.  Really?  You don't know how to do it?  Really?  What's Mike Seeger?  Okay, Bobby Collins.  You guys know the Google?  Okay, Bobby Collins.  Yeah, you guys use the MTV? 
[03:38:00]  Shut up.  81, you fucking cunt.  How about in movies where they can't figure out how not to use the fucking phone recorder?  Like you have no messages?  Like people are still walking in, hitting their tape recorders?  You know what I mean?  Do you know what I'm fucking saying?  No.  Like a fucking tape recorder?  You've lost everyone in the room.  How did you do that?  We were having fun.  Anthony understands.  No, we're checking our email.  Oh.  I'm trying to see. 
[03:38:30]  I'm looking at stock updates.  I want to know who Mike Seeger is.  He's dead.  Doesn't matter.  Mike Seeger.  Who he was.  Pete Seeger's brother, Steven.  Oh.  That was Tweety, you assholes.  That was Tweety.  Jesus Christ, you pulled that out of your ass.  It was Tweety, you fucking assholes.  Maybe it's Pete Seeger died.  Or was Pete Seeger alive?  I don't know.  Australian bluegrass blog.  Mike Seeger passed away. 
[03:39:00]  Mike Seeger illness and his decision to move into a hospice at his home in Virginia.  He lost his battle with cancer.  Mike died surrounded by loved ones.  Who is he?  Who is he?  His wife's son and his sister.  Tweety, you asshole.  Tweety, you asshole.  They're saying he was an American folk music icon.  Who the fuck is Warren Jerome?  One of the fucking fucking Tweety men.  Who gives a fuck who Warren Jerome is?  Yeah.  Shut up.  Tell him.  Tell him, Mike.  Yeah, you tell him who Warren Jerome was.  Tweety, you assholes.  What's that from?  Bad Boys.  Who gives a shit about this fucking guy? 
[03:39:30]  Why don't you just draw a fucking little bird flying over a fence?  Clancy Brown, one of the great fucking not famous actors that ever lived.  That was one of the worst movies on the planet, Bad Boys.  Not the Martin Lawrence fucking original.  No, that wasn't bad, but fucking the original Bad Boys with Sean Penn was genius.  Oh, that's the way he beat him with the soda cans in the sock?  Yeah, he saw Morales.  Horowitz.  Oh, that was good.  Clancy Brown.  And the Vikings listening to the awful song, trying to snap with his fucking video by his head.  The boom box by his head.  Oh, what a great film that was. 
[03:40:00]  That was a good one.  We can't do more.  Tweety, you assholes.  Mike Singer's dead.  We gotta go home and run.  Yeah, Mike, we gotta mourn.  We gotta plug.  Hey, thanks, man, for the plugs, too, though.  We appreciate it.  We barely plugged you, Patrice.  Once again, Patrice on your Cleveland Improv.

I'm going to Cleveland fucking this Thursday.  Well, this says the 21st.  Hold the fuck up.  That would be a week from now.  Oh, I hope you go the wrong week. 
[03:40:30]  Oh, God, that would be so funny.  I'm getting nervous.  This is the big plug, Patrice.  You gotta get it right.  No, don't get nervous.

I imagine this will sell out because it's Long Island and it's a very small theater.  Do you think you'll miss your show at the Y?  It's not a soup kitchen or anything.  It's an actual venue.
