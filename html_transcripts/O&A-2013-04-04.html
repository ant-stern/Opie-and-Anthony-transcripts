<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the usual chaotic opening announcements, immediately transitioning into vulgar banter between Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton.  Their conversation covered a range of topics, starting with complaints about iPhones – specifically, battery life, charging cables, and the need for a "Kill" app to manage background processes.  They moved on to tech news, mocking Apple's potential new products and criticizing the perceived over-complexity of a rumored Facebook phone.  Their frustration extended to Facebook itself, where they lamented inspirational posts, fake news, and spam, contrasting it unfavorably with Twitter and MySpace.  Similar critiques were leveled at Yahoo Mail and Hotmail, with Gmail receiving their endorsement.  The length of Apple's charging cables also received its share of comedic derision.

A significant portion of the show was devoted to a discussion of North Korea's nuclear threats, fueled by a quote from the North Korean military ("The moment of explosion is approaching fast."). The hosts speculated on the size and capabilities of the North Korean military, expressing varying levels of concern regarding the potential US response.  This was followed by a segment mocking baseball announcer John Sterling's repetitive and often nonsensical home run calls, particularly those for players like Travis Hafner and Vernon Wells.  Audio clips were played, generating further comedic commentary, including listener interaction and mentions of show personnel, alongside a running gag about a listener named Bobo and his Twitter activity.

The show then shifted gears with an anecdote about a listener's strange cab ride, featuring repeated use of "mister" and the mispronunciation "piscettis."  This led to a discussion of upcoming guests: Todd Roskin (promoting a Russ Meyer biopic) and Chris Jericho (to be interviewed about *Robot Wars* and WrestleMania). The hosts offered their cynical commentary on the Associated Press and political correctness before launching into a crude "America's Got Genitals" segment, a comedic penis-judging contest.  An Elvis Presley song interlude sparked a discussion about Elvis’s drug use and the hosts’ opinions on the music.

The upcoming move of *The Tonight Show* to New York with Jimmy Fallon was a lengthy topic, contrasting Fallon's style with Jay Leno's and speculating on the futures of Conan O'Brien and David Letterman. This was followed by analysis of a difficult interview of Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman on *The Late Show with David Letterman*.  A caller then engaged the hosts in a lengthy discussion about toll booths and EasyPass systems, including aggressive driving, near-confrontations with toll booth attendants, and their individual EasyPass usage methods. The discussion included the caller's experiences with Chicago's "open road tolling" system and a humorous suggestion to invite Chip Chipperson to *The Late Show*.

A caller recounted calling 911 for a flat tire in the Bronx at 4:30 AM, highlighting their fear and lack of tire-changing skills.  The hosts responded with mockery.  This transitioned into a humorous bit about "BoboCop," a fictional imbecile cyborg police officer, followed by a satirical reading from the fictional "Book of Ted."  Todd Rodskrine then entered the studio, presenting an autographed photo of Kit Natividad, leading to a lengthy, extremely vulgar discussion about Natividad's physique, and female body types in general.  Rodskrine discussed his short film, its reception in Germany, and the unexpected questions he faced about Russ Meyer.  The conversation frequently circled back to explicit descriptions of women's bodies, references to pornography, and comparisons between old-fashioned and online pornography access. Dr. Steve offered a humorous medical perspective on the phrase "juicy ass."  Rodskrine promoted his film, clarifying the lack of nudity, and the conversation concluded with a discussion on nudity in art and television (including *Game of Thrones*), differing American and European sensibilities, and a humorous anecdote about a wrestler, Fandango, and lotion.  The segment concluded with promotion of WrestleMania and Chris Jericho's appearance.


The next segment featured Chris Jericho as the main guest, discussing his WWE experience with Fandango, his upcoming WrestleMania match, and his work on *Robot Combat League*.  Amy Schumer then made a surprise appearance, engaging in sexually suggestive banter with the hosts and Jericho. The conversation included discussions of Schumer's show, *Inside Amy Schumer*, bad Stephen King movies, uninvited fans, police interactions, Jericho’s drunk driving experiences, and a harrowing jail experience with gang members. Profanity and sexually explicit references were frequent.

A later segment focused on a guest’s arrest for drunk driving after a bus ride with naked women, detailing his subsequent legal ramifications and his resulting sobriety. This transitioned into a discussion of Chris Jericho's early music career, with Jimmy Norton and Amy Schumer joining in studio, along with Sam Roberts, a wrestling commentator. Roberts discussed his career frustrations, comparing his niche focus to the guest's drunk driving incident.  He contrasted his situation with the broader appeal of other media personalities and discussed the difficulties of securing a major broadcasting role.  The conversation touched upon Sam's YouTube videos and interactions with other personalities like Michelle Beadle, including a humorous aside about his wife possibly allowing infidelity with Beyoncé. A caller challenged Roberts' perspective.  Genesis Rodriguez then joined, promoting a Gillette campaign.  The show ended with a preview of the YouTube live event.  The segment featured significant profanity and sexually suggestive humor.

The final segment focused on men's grooming, with the hosts suggesting hyperbolic and crude grooming practices.  This involved a comedic bit with E-Rock, who was given the nickname "Sex Bagel," and involved a dramatic re-entrance.  Genesis Rodriguez's Twitter handle was mentioned, alongside promotion for a YouTube live event featuring Rodriguez and Kate Upton.  The hosts repeatedly emphasized the importance of grooming for attracting women, using hyperbolic and often crude humor.  E-Rock's theatrical exit and repeated nonsensical phrases concluded the show.  The segment utilized crude and sexually suggestive language throughout.

[00:02:30]  O.P. and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:03:00]  I'm standing here at the studios of Sirius XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:03:30]  It's a weekly morning approximately 6 a.m.  And this is O.P. and Anthony show.  O.P. and Anthony show has one radio show been so extreme.  O.P. and Anthony show starts now.

I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  It's not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  Oh, and every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah!  Rules are destroyed, and conventions burn the ground. 
[00:04:30]  Would you like to make some fucking second?  With Opie the destroyer.  I would eat Betty White's ass.  He's 90, right?  It doesn't smell too bad.  Anthony the Rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fare you wanted?  I'm tired of these people up my ass all the time trying to get me to help.  Fuck you!  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender.  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off like, surprise! 
[00:05:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  This palaver.  There I am.  Yeah, the mics.  Sam, you know, the microphones.  The microphone's on. 
[00:05:30]  Microphone.  I can't hear.  The screen turns off.  God damn it.  Stop.  I moved this fucking...  I just love pestering...  It shuts off.  I love pestering Anthony by hitting his little computer screen in the back of my...  Yes, indeedy do.  And they were going to move this for me, but I was like, yeah, who cares?  It's fine.  Why?  Hi, everyone.  I just took some emergency. 
[00:06:00]  What?  Back of my throat.  I'm like, eh.  You know that nasal drips feel you get when...  And then you make the mistake of going, you know, a day goes by and you're just kind  of sitting there going, I wonder what that is.  And you're swallowing, swallowing, swallowing, swallowing.  I wonder what that is.  And then you realize, oh, fuck.  It's what it is every time I get it.  I'm getting sick.  You should try some...  I'm telling you, those coldies lozenges with the zinc in them.  Yes.  Those fucking things.  They don't ruin a cold.  Those zinc. 
[00:06:30]  Now you put them in a bathroom by the zinc.  You take one and there's something in those that really helps at the very beginning of  a cold.  I fucking can't sing enough praise for coldies.  You certainly can't.  That's all I want to talk about.  Jiminy Cricket.  But I just sent an intern out, too, for fucking another iPhone 5 charger charging cable.  You losing them?  No.  I know where they are. 
[00:07:00]  Not here.  That's the problem with the fucking thing.  I wound up accumulating quite a few of the old style ones.  And they're everywhere.  They're in my bag.  They're fucking at my house.  They're at the apartment.  In the car.  They're all over the place.  And then I'm looking today and I'm like, oh, of course.  I don't have one of the new ones.  So now, again, I'm going to get more.  These things are fucking, they sure know how to get money out of you.  What percentage do you have of your battery? 
[00:07:30]  Right now, I am at 16%.  Do you know that I realized someone from a comic show, B, like, it sounds dumb and I thought  I knew how to always have my apps off.  My apps are running all the time.  All the time.  Just double click the home button.  Yeah.  And fucking these.  Do you turn these off all the time?  No.  Double click the home button and all those things at the bottom.  Yeah.  With the little red lines next to them.  That's running right now.  I've been saving a lot of battery by just turning them off.  Let me see what you got there.  Like a whole bunch.  Yeah. 
[00:08:00]  Where's the red lines?  You hit the double click the home button.  I did.  Then you got to hold it.  You got to, like, click one, push one in.  No, then Siri comes on.  No, hold it.  Just double click it.  Don't double click the button.  What are you talking about?  Double click it.  Oh, my God, Siri's on.  Not the button, the icon itself.  Open it up.  Christ almighty.  I'm weird with people's phones.  I know how I am with my phone.  I don't want to open it up on a fucking cock picture.  Hold one of the icons. 
[00:08:30]  In the bottom row.  So they're shaky, you know?  Yeah, I gotcha.  Yeah.  And the fucking 12 is open.  Oh, yeah, everything's running.  Yeah, I do that too.  It kills my battery.  Well, how about I just do this?  I go to a little app called Kill, and I hit it, and then I see everything that's running,  and then I go like that, and it shuts them all down.  I just fucking...  Wow, that's a pretty cool app.  Yes, it rules.  I didn't know that.  Yeah, see?  Where'd you get the Kill app?  Just put Kill in the fucking search engine.  I found it accidentally.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:09:00]  Well, you're trying to find it for specific people.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, it really is.  They just run fucking constantly.  The battery on the Apple 5, it's terrible.  It honestly is terrible.  I've used my phone and just felt heat generating off of this fucking thing, and where you have  heat, you have a battery drain.  The hotter something gets, oh boy, the faster it goes down. 
[00:09:30]  And I find myself at home having the thing plugged in constantly.  You gotta get the battery case.  Your battery case is stupid.  I hate battery keys, because they're too slippery.  Are they slippery at all?  It is.  Look, I can see it over there.  It's fucking sliding all over.  It's rubber bag.  It's slippery, Sam.  Sam just gave the worst demonstration ever.  He just put it in his hand and moved his hand back and forth.  It's not slipping at all.  It's a commercial.  Yeah, I leave it plugged in all the time.  It fucking gets hot, and then you unplug it. 
[00:10:00]  I've watched the fucking battery just go down.  Like, oh, there it is.  It's fucking 50%, 49, 48.  I'll have 100% battery when I leave the house at like 4.30, and then by the time the show  starts, I'm already down to 90%.  Yeah.  What could I have possibly done from 4.30 to...  Do you have things running in the background?  Not really.  Like, my email...  I'll leave the stuff that I open all the time open, but...  Oh.  If it hits the LTE, it just kills it. 
[00:10:30]  It's like a race for me to get home before my phone dies in the afternoon.  Yeah.  Because, yeah, the LTE just destroys its life.  They're going to do something about that on the next incarnation?  Are they announcing something?  I'm hearing that this fucking Apple TV...  Because they would talk about the iWatch all the time, and I'm like, that has to be a...  Like, that might be a little thing they're doing, but there's no way they're betting the farm  on iWatch.  You can't.  I've heard they're having a lot of issues with iOS 7 that they want to put out, like, 
[00:11:00]  because they want to completely redesign it.  Really?  Yeah.  But I've heard that they're having some issues.  I hear about ITV also.  That's a big story today.  With the fucking 60-inch TV, it's Apple fucking, you know, friendly.  It's got all the little apps in there and everything.  And a ring on your finger that you just point at the TV.  A ring on your finger.  Yeah.  One ring to rule them all.  Well, you put it on your prick, and then you really show off in front of a girl.  Apple cock ring.  The C ring. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  You just stand up and poke your rod at it, and all of a sudden you're on CNBC.  Good improv for channels.  How can I not think of a channel?  There's 10,000, and I just...  I picked CNBC.  Yeah, that's the big news today.  And another thing in tech news.  It's our little tech news segment.  There's Facebook.  It's coming out with their own little smartphone.  With their own little apps and everything.  And I guess it's an HT, what is that, HTC? 
[00:12:00]  HTC phone?  Yeah.  If that's the three initials that I'm looking for.  But now I hear they're lining up in front of the Facebook stores.  There's big lines.  It's the iPhone killer.  Nobody wants a Facebook phone.  What's a Facebook phone?  I don't even like going to Facebook.  Windows tried to do that like a couple years ago where they had like a social media phone.  Yeah.  And it bombed horribly because nobody...  You already do your social media on your phone.  I'm already doing it on my phone.  I've got my Facebook app.  Why do you need a Facebook phone for fucking... 
[00:12:30]  When everything goes to Facebook.  Can I see a picture?  You get your Facebook app.  They haven't officially announced it yet.  You don't want a phone on a Facebook phone?  I assume it'll look like a phone.  I am so fucked.  I don't know why I still have a Facebook account.  I go there.  Like, I'll check, you know, Twitter and Instagram.  And then I'll check Facebook.  And right when I'm clicking on it, I'm just like, ugh, why?  It's 90% of it now is crappy... 
[00:13:00]  People's crappy fucking inspirational messages.  And then, I just want to let everyone know that we had to take little fucking Fido to the vet today and put him down.  He's been such a big part of our family for many years.  And we...  Who gives a shit about your dead dog?  No.  It's not.  It's an intrusion.  And then other people with their fucking dumb inspirational messages. 
[00:13:30]  Love is...  I can't unfriend someone quick enough.  And then I wonder how I ever friended somebody with such stupid ideas.  See, it's good for us because we have a lot of friends.  Because a lot of people request our friendship on Facebook.  Yeah.  So I get a lot of conservative photos.  And then a lot of liberal photos telling me what's going on.  Well, that's true.  Because neither of them are skewed.  I do like a good meme. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  I like a good political meme.  Now, Facebook has gotten so fucking annoying.  And then just the fucking junk you get.  The spam.  I've had it.  And I'm just blocking people.  I'm just unfriending people.  The cycle is ridiculous on Facebook.  Like, there's a picture that will be passed around.  And everybody will see it.  And then an hour after everybody's seen it, it was fake.  It was fake.  The whole thing was fake. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  Fake, fake.  Totally fake.  Why would you just wait?  Two hours of my life is just wasted.  And then, like, just lies that people post.  Yeah.  That they think it's true.  Do you know, three years ago, Obama said that all of our soldiers should die?  Look, I don't like the guy either, but I doubt he said that.  I don't need a citation.  Yeah.  You know what gets an immediate unfriending?  Whenever somebody shares those, uh, we're giving away 5,000 iPhones because we found them in our stock room. 
[00:15:00]  Goodbye.  Just fucking gone.  We need people to test the PlayStation 4 that hasn't even been unveiled yet.  Yeah.  Ooh.  Share this photo.  Share it.  Yeah.  I've had it with Facebook.  I don't know why I go there.  It's too confusing.  It's too much noise.  Like, Louie was right yesterday about simplistic.  Like, Twitter's very simple.  All these things are very simple. 
[00:15:30]  MySpace was simple.  I mean, it just got too much spam.  But when it was happening, it was a simple thing.  Did you like the MySpace?  At the time, it was a pretty cool thing to get to a photo.  You could see people.  It was, you know.  See people.  But that's what killed MySpace is that everybody started to be able to do, like, whatever they want on their page.  They allowed people to completely customize it.  Oh, my God.  So there was too much shit.  And so none of the pages would load because everybody had, like, you know, dancing bears and stuff.  Oh, is that what it was on?  Okay.  I was very guilty of, um, instead of just putting my favorite movies in, like, what are my favorite movies? 
[00:16:00]  I would put clips of my favorite movies.  Yeah.  So that when you open my fucking page, all the movies would just start playing.  Right.  It was everyone's GeoCities website in one place.  Yes.  And it wasn't because it looked good.  It was just because you could.  Like, look what I can do.  Look what I can do.  Oh, I learned how to fucking put this little bit of code in here.  Yeah.  So let me just use it because I know how to do it.  MySpace.  The spam is what got me on MySpace.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:16:30]  It's like AOL.  The spam filter on AOL is fucking abysmal.  It's abysmal.  I could never.  I just gave up on the entire company.  I couldn't tell you that AOL was still in existence.  I can't.  You're not much better using Yahoo Mail.  No, I kind of got off of Yahoo Mail.  Did you?  Yeah.  Gmail, is that the best?  Absolutely.  Why is it?  Because they just do things good.  I have my Apple exclusive mail.  Good.  I have my fucking Apple mail.  You got your me?  I got my me.  I hate me. 
[00:17:00]  You know, like me?  I mean that like in a really, really broad sense.  Yeah, yeah.  So does everyone else.  Oh, man.  No, it's, uh, yeah, the Yahoo Mail is fucking terrible.  Is it bad?  I've used to say.  I've, like, emailed stuff to myself having to, you know, do that from the other one.  It shows up like ten minutes later.  It's like, what is this?  A fucking actual postal carrier?  Yeah, it's archaic.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hotmail, too.  Hotmail?  Yeah.  Where's my GeoCities? 
[00:17:30]  Ooh, wow, that was fast.  Thanks, Yorick.  Here's my lightning to USB cable.  Yet another one.  Yeah.  Where did I get that at this hour?  The Apple store.  The 24-hour Apple store, Jimmy.  How dumb am I?  It's New York City.  They got this Apple store then?  Oh, you know, for you, I just, I consider myself to be a stepper, too.  Coin city yourself.  My douche.  That, the other day.  Really?  What the fuck is that?  The fuck is that? 
[00:18:00]  What is that?  It's, uh, that's, that's, is it, are they new?  Is it, they're short now?  Or, well, it's a foot and a half long.  He's saying it's the only one they have.  This is 18 inches long.  I know.  Give me a, put it in my ass.  I know there's a longer one, because I own it.  Yeah, I own the longer ones, too.  Why are they selling a teeny one?  And how much do they charge for the teeny one?  It's $19.  For that one?  Yeah.  I think it's the same price for both.  Why is there a short, what advantage is that?  Like, oh, look, even less mobility.  Why?  Yeah. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, like, sometimes I like to plug it into my computer at home, which is, uh, in front  of the couch, you know, and, and, and lay on the couch and use it plugged in.  This, I, I'd be hanging off my arm and hanging over the edge of the couch.  I like to, I like to plug my iPhone into the wall and then stretch it like at the top step  and then beckon a senior citizen.  Well, there we go.  You got the one and a half foot.  Yes, this is the one and a half footer.  Not the three foot one.  Jeez.  What is the use of making a shorter cable? 
[00:19:00]  I guess the idea would be if it's on your desk, you don't want an extra foot of cable.  Extra 18 inches of cable.  Do you still have a home?  I have, I have a real dilemma.  I still have my home computer.  Like, it's a fucking massive.  Yeah.  I got it years ago.  It was expensive.  It's like.  Oh, a desk.  Yeah.  Big desktop.  It's got the 30 inch monitor, which is too big.  I want to get rid of it.  Wow.  I kind of want to get a shorter 27 inch monitor, but I'm like, do I even need that?  I don't know what to do.  Like, I'm at this, I don't want to spend more money on something I'm not going to use. 
[00:19:30]  Why do you need a desktop?  You don't do anything really.  I don't know.  Graphics.  But I kind of want it for like editing for the, do I do, do I really need it or no?  Maybe I don't even need it.  I'm just telling myself.  Well, for what, for what you're doing, you know, if you're in an editing house and you  have those big fucking monitors and, and you're running a, you know, Final Cut Pro and After  Effects and Photoshop and all that, that's one thing.  But if you're just fucking, you know, cutting and pasting video, you don't really need a 
[00:20:00]  giant desktop.  If you get a laptop, like a MacBook with a solid state drive, you can run, I mean, Final Cut  runs like lightning.  Macbook Pro does?  Yeah, yeah.  On a MacBook Pro with a solid state drive.  I run all the editing stuff on, um, on fucking, uh, laptops.  Yeah.  It's amazing how quick they go.  It's like a type of hard drive.  It basically runs like flash memory like they use in the iPhone instead of moving.  Spinny movie, uh, moving.  Get one with the retina display.  That's not it, is it?  Yeah, it is. 
[00:20:30]  Are those all new?  MacBooks with retina display?  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Couldn't say display.  What's better than when someone says display and then just keeps talking?  So, is that those newer ones?  I don't think I have that one.  Yeah, no.  No, you don't.  Okay.  Yeah, get the one with retina display.  It's like really thin and, uh, super fast.  So it looks at your eye?  No.  The retina display is like the resolution of the screen.  It's as high quality as like the iPhone and the iPad screen. 
[00:21:00]  Oh.  It's super display.  Super crisp.  Because I want to shoot something and, uh.  Yeah.  You're so dumb.  It always goes there.  No, but you're right.  The first thing I thought of when you said I found my kill app and I'm like, well, I  hope you use it on yourself.  Of course.  There's nothing better than encouraging a friend to actually do it.  You do it constantly.  Um, I was, I was thinking of how funny that line was when poor E-Rock said something about  snatch my bag and you said the one around your face.  Just how fucking mean and funny that was. 
[00:21:30]  It's so mean to imply that he straps a feed bag on so he can eat constantly.  I can just picture the poor kid standing there with a feed bag, working the board, just  really, God bless him.  God damn, Louie was right, man, about the fucking, the simplicity of this company.  Yeah.  Like, oh, that whole thing yesterday, man.  They gotta simplify it because they're allowing other, other mediums to catch up by making  things easier for people.  Yeah, there's really no reason to, to have this two companies in one company thing. 
[00:22:00]  It's, it's ridiculous.  And it's a fucking, it's a good service, but podcasts are catching up.  It's like, I don't understand why they would allow that.  Why make it difficult?  Why make people pay twice?  It's just, it seems very, it's very odd.  How easy would it be to just, I mean, still charge what you're going to charge, but just  say, okay, it's $20 a month and you get every channel and the internet.  Yeah.  And then if you don't want it, call us and for 10 bucks a month, we'll just give you  the music.  Yeah.  But like the standard package is just everything. 
[00:22:30]  And you don't have to think about it.  You're like, yes.  And then it's 20 bucks a month and that's it.  Football, baseball.  He's, it's a, what do you, he was right.  That was a great point.  He's, he's a really good explainer of points, which helps when you're a comedian, but fucking  what makes radio and TV is it's, you hit this button and like, there's everything.  Everything comes on.  All it is.  It's magical.  It's right in front of you.  Yep.  Yeah.  I don't, I don't get it either.  And, and I've been, people have explained it to me and it's like, wait, some radios can  get that. 
[00:23:00]  Some can't, some don't have that channel.  Well, there's two separate satellite systems also orbiting the planet.  You know, when you, when you, your whole fucking business model is based on things that  are in outer space, it gets a little dodgy, but, uh, you can't get up there and tinker  with it.  You can't just futz with it.  Yeah.  You can't get up there and go, well, let me futz with this satellite.  So it fucking get puts this channel here.  Uh, so I think that's an issue.  All right.  But, uh, no one's really explained it to me where I can grasp it. 
[00:23:30]  I, I assume there are some radios that are in certain cars and others in other cars that  get one thing or the other.  Um, I don't know.  Part of it is the technology.  I think like there's serious, like plus people already have a serious radio or an XM radio.  It's like, and they, they explain some of the technical stuff that is hard to work around.  Like why we're on two different channels, like why Howard's on one-on-one on both and 
[00:24:00]  we had to be on different ones.  It's got something to do with the XM to serious radios.  They can't make that switch because they weren't designed to make that switch.  Yeah.  But that's also because we're on best of XM.  So if there was no best of XM, we just blow out one of the lower numbered channels and  just put us on one-on-five on serious and don't charge people extra for it.  Right.  Yeah.  That would be the solution.  It sounds like there's definitely a solution, but, uh, they're not implementing it.  No.  You know, it's the best of stuff that's killing us.  Yeah, yeah.  How much money does that make him?  I guess that makes him a shitload of money. 
[00:24:30]  I don't know, but I think Louie had a good point yesterday when he said that bigger picture,  people would probably subscribe more if it was easier and therefore you're making that  money back and probably more.  And if you had better salespeople, uh, and there are some good salespeople, of course, but  it's like a better overall sales way of doing it where you could make more money in advertising.  Mm-hmm.  Talk shows have to have advertising.  We're not going to talk for four hours.  You got to take a break.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You got to put something else on here. 
[00:25:00]  What I like to do is we, like when I think it's time for a break, sometimes, you know,  uh, Ope usually throws us to break, but I'll put my finger up and I mouth, I mouth the  words, let's simmer down.  Simmered.  Is that it?  Yeah.  I say, let's simmer down.  Let's simmer down.  Don't go to break there.  Ooh, but maybe Iraq would have thought that was time for a break.  No, no, no, no, just an example.  Uh, yeah, yeah.  They got to, they got to easy it up, make it a little easier.  Uh, also it's fucking, the Korean thing is big in the news today. 
[00:25:30]  Uh, what?  I, I don't know.  And I'm not bashing Obama or anything.  Believe me, I, I could sit here and do that all fucking day, but I, I am seeing that this  is, there's a lackadaisical kind of attitude here with this thing that now, now Korea last  night, I guess they, they all had been getting together, the Koreans, they're the North Koreans  and meeting with their generals and everything else.  And last night they made a little announcement that they are ready, they have approved, with 
[00:26:00]  all of their people, approved a nuclear strike on the United States.  This, uh, all right, now, now everybody's going, oh, they're adorable, look at the wacky  Koreans, at it again.  Uh, they're threatening a nuclear attack on America.  Ah, they're a country with nuclear devices.  Um, I do understand they've pulled some shenanigans in the past, but never to this level. 
[00:26:30]  Whether they're going to do it or not, what the odds are if they're going to do it or not,  is debatable, but I think a stronger, uh, reaction, even, even just, uh, verbally, is  needed here by the leadership.  I think any president, uh, if you look back, you know, or Ronnie Reagan or, you know, Kennedy,  even all that, would say something very strong to let these fuckers know, hey, shut the fuck 
[00:27:00]  up.  We don't want you spreading this shit, like saying you're going to nuke us.  I'm not seeing that.  Uh, I'm seeing, you know, they're, they're, they're posturing, uh, ships and, and flying,  um, bombers over, uh, and, and, and putting on these demonstrations of power, which is fine.  That's all good and well.  Do you want a quote from the North Korean military?  Sure.  I sure do.  The moment of explosion is approaching fast.  Oh, shit.  I know that happens to me a little too soon sometimes. 
[00:27:30]  I got to stop moving.  By that, he means shitting his pants.  Warning that war could break out today or tomorrow.  What about the next day?  No.  Do they literally mean today or tomorrow?  Yeah, that's the weekend.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  They're not going to do a fucking, I don't know why it's like we've constantly given them  money.  Yeah.  I'm sick of that dog shit country.  I really, let the fucking South Koreans handle them.  Yeah.  Let the fucking South Koreans, I told you, I want to pull out of the DMZ. 
[00:28:00]  I don't want a DMZ.  It's not my business.  Yeah, yeah.  But they are threatening us.  They're not going to do a fucking thing.  Well, see, that's the thing.  We have our nose in their business.  That's why.  You think that's why?  Of course it is.  We shouldn't be.  They probably want, they don't want us.  They want to South Korea.  We don't belong over there.  Why the fuck is the U.S. military in Korea?  I understand that.  But you also have to understand, we do have allies all over the world.  And if we just pull out of Korea, the other allies will be like, well, you know, how dependable 
[00:28:30]  can the United States be?  You need alliances in the world.  I mean, it's very difficult to just run alone.  We can have alliances.  If, you know, if one of our allies is in trouble and we think that we should help them, we help  them.  But as far as having our fucking stupid American feet on every piece of soil, I'm tired of  it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What we should do is get out.  Ron Paul is right.  Pull out.  And then if they fucking do something, the response should be barbaric.  Barbaric.  I mean, I don't mean allow people to walk on us. 
[00:29:00]  I mean, if we were to be attacked or our interests were to be attacked, then the response should  be horrendous.  And it should be an attack on their major cities and civilians.  They should understand that.  Korea is an odd situation because, you know, it's been this way for so long.  It never was solved.  This isn't a this isn't a North Korea, South Korea.  They, you know, signed they signed a peace treaty or anything. 
[00:29:30]  I mean, technically, the two countries are kind of still at war.  So there's that buffer zone in the middle and and South Korea being our ally for so long.  I mean, times have changed since the 50s till now.  So we might not step in in the context of today if it was happening, you know, just roll  in and go in.  But since we've been there so long, I think it's just kind of a habit.  We're just kind of there.  And this is why, you know, Kim Jong Un and Kim Jong Il is full of shit and Kim Jong Un is 
[00:30:00]  full of shit.  If they wanted a war with the United States, they would plow over the DMZ.  They would plow into South Korea, kill the soldiers we have there, which I believe would  be considered an extreme act of aggression and would force our hand.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's all he has to do.  He doesn't have to threaten nuclear war.  All he has to do is fucking run into South Korea and kill all of our soldiers.  Yeah.  And he easily could.  I mean, what do we have?  14000 soldiers?  They have a pretty big standing army, but it's debatable how well-equipped they are. 
[00:30:30]  They're not really getting any support that they used to get for parts and stuff for their  machines.  So, you know, they might have a big standing army, but it's pretty dated and rusty.  But, yeah, they could absolutely roll right over the border and cause some fucking havoc.  Oh, yeah.  I think they have, I want to say 700,000 people.  I think it's like a million man standing army, yeah. 
[00:31:00]  There's almost 20,000 U.S. Army soldiers in Korea, 300 Navy, 9,000 Air Force.  Okay.  So, about 30,000 people total?  Yeah, roughly, yeah.  Okay.  And how many North Koreans are there?  Soldiers.  Let's see.  I had heard 700,000, but...  I heard a million, but that probably includes like every woman with a pitchfork also, you  know.  They just, yeah, let's fucking pad our numbers with fucking the children. 
[00:31:30]  Koreans, people, people, people's army.  The people's army!  As of 2013, 9.4 million active reserve and paramilitary personnel.  It's the largest military organization on Earth.  Oh, maybe I'm bringing 700,000 on the DMZ.  The largest military, I bet that's active reserve.  You know what that is?  That's every grandma, everybody.  Everyone is technically in the army.  It's probably the entire population.  It's ridiculous. 
[00:32:00]  I don't know what his end game is, though.  You know, it's like, why threaten?  And I think also people are taking it a little more seriously because it's a threat of nukes  and it's the first time Kim Jong-un has been in charge during one of these, like, crazy  we're gonna do some shit to you.  It's 1.1 million active.  Active.  8.2 reserve.  Oh!  So it's like fucking 2 million.  What?  What?  1.2 million active? 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  1.1 million.  Oh.  Active.  8.2 million reserve.  And they do the wacky fucking goose step thing.  Yeah, they like that.  They like that.  They like parading their missiles around on trucks.  We should do that shit.  No one ever gets a good glimpse of what we got.  All these fucking crazy nations, they have those parades with the missiles.  We have parades with drunks with green hats.  Let's get some good fucking missile parades in this country.  That's what I say.  Put them on those trucks.  Wheel them through the streets.  I love those parades.  They look fun, don't they? 
[00:33:00]  They really look fun.  A lot of flags.  A lot of pomp and circumstance.  Mm-hmm.  Here's a good army parade.  What?  In four seconds.  Is that North Korean?  Yeah.  Army parade.  They do know how to parade and do things.  Yeah, they like a good parade.  They're very fucking, you know, of one.  They're like the Borg, these North Koreans.  But even the music sounds old school.  Look at how they're clapping.  They're all like, ah, ah, ah.  Who's that guy?  Not Kim Jong-un or Il. 
[00:33:30]  Who's that one?  Uh, Kim Jong Fields.  Wow, they, that looks like Nazis.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're very Nazi-ish when you look at, like, the squares of people moving.  Yeah.  And then they do the wacky goose-steppy things.  What a little fat man.  I cannot look at him without thinking of fucking South Park.  It is very Nazi, goose-steppy-ish.  And that just shows a people that have really no, no minds of their own. 
[00:34:00]  Right.  Everything's in unison.  They have to be very proud or they get killed.  Looking at the leader with his dumb fucking, I love his dumb, like, mob guy on trial glasses.  Kim Jong-il when he had those, uh, big shaded fucking, uh, glasses.  Yeah.  The big fucking ace glasses.  Yeah.  Ace Rothstein.  Ace Rothstein glasses. 
[00:34:30]  Ace is high.  And they're both fat and out of shape and so un-military looking.  Yeah, he's, he's, he was just a terrible, he didn't look snappy in his uniform.  That's what I was going to say.  Yeah, it's not even really, like, a uniform.  It looks like an old, like, early 80s kind of workout jumpsuit.  It's like a prison jumpsuit.  Yeah, it's that.  That old men would wear.  Or like a painter would wear that so he doesn't get his clothes.  Yeah, he's wearing a smock.  He just asks for something with a zipper that goes on quick.  Yeah.  And they're all ugly. 
[00:35:00]  I think it was when we were kings, when they were talking about, uh, Matu, uh, what was his name?  Uh, Mobutu?  The guy who ran Zaire.  And how, how dictators, there's pictures of them all over.  And they're all horribly unattractive.  And they really are ugly men.  I think that's part of why you become a dictator, though.  You know, I, I think if you grew up, uh, handsome, uh, you would be given certain things and feel a certain way.  And people would adore you for, from an early age.  And you wouldn't need, uh, to be a dictator.  Yeah, I don't think anybody who was popular in high school. 
[00:35:30]  Becomes a dictator.  Goes on to become a dictator.  You don't think, yeah.  They already have people being like, yo, you're the shit.  Yeah, yeah.  They don't have to command it.  If you've dated cheerleaders, you're probably not going to be a dictator.  No.  That speech Anthony just gave is one I could picture you, with a beer in your hand, giving  to your wife and children, like when they're wondering why things are so bad in the house.  Nobody happy grows up to be a dictator.  No one.  Like, sit down!  I would, I would be, uh, I don't know, I wonder how I'd be if I had a wife and kids. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, I thought you meant as a dictator.  Well, that too.  I say equally awful.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I would run my, run the house like that.  I, I think I would probably think about, like, how I grew up and probably tried not to do  that.  You know, no spaghetti against the walls.  No calling my kid pissy eyes.  Yeah, that's probably bad.  Unless he was pissy eyed.  But the thing is, I don't like public scenes.  I fucking hate public scenes.  I don't even like when, when people speak loudly. 
[00:36:30]  Like, if I'm having a conversation in a public place with somebody, and they're a little loud,  and people are hearing it, I don't like that at all.  So, the whole thing of having a family is a public scene.  Right.  The kids are yapping.  You gotta tell them to shut up.  They'd be able to walk all over you.  I want this, I want that, whatever.  I'd be like, shh, shh.  Come on, shh.  I'd be this guy.  Shh, shh, come on, shh, shut up.  Stop it.  Handling tantrums the worst way possible.  It's exactly what you're not supposed to do.  I'll give you whatever you want, just shut up.  Yeah, what the fuck?  How do you do that? 
[00:37:00]  Come on, Travis, what do you do?  Well, you see MASH, the last MASH.  You suffocate that chicken?  What do you do, Travis?  Is a scene gonna happen?  Your kid starts yelling at something in a public place.  What do I do?  Yeah, how do you stop it without a scene happening?  Tell her to be quiet.  She does it?  Yeah, she's very, yeah, she's good.  She's pretty good.  You shouldn't, you should have someone else, I don't know.  Yeah.  She doesn't make many scenes.  But you don't know that when you have them. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah, no.  You can't order a seamless baby.  Yeah.  They're always fucking, I see it in like, you go to the store and some kid's yelling and  crying and they're like, yo, when we get home, and it's like, oh, I would hate that.  I would run away.  I'd run away from the situation.  You do have to refine your tactics over time, though, because like, I used to like, you  know, start, start trying to be funny or like, you know, trying for you.  Well, it was, I mean, you know, I could try it here.  She starts crying, you know, you know, yeah, tell a bunch of jokes or something, you fucking, 
[00:38:00]  you know, she starts crying, you start mocking her crying, you know, and it turns into, you  know, like, right, like a game.  But now, now it's like, don't make fun of me.  And she'll run into her room.  Oh, she's even more hysterical.  She knows you're making fun of her.  Now you're giving her a complex.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm not happy with the scenes.  That's why with like the.  No, I'm glad I never had to.  Yeah.  The ex-wife. 
[00:38:30]  It was always like a scene and I hate scenes.  So I'd be like, don't, don't, don't fucking not here, not now.  Grab her arm.  Stop.  And that's, and that's worse too, because you know, when you're out and you see something  happening, you always pick up on it from the guy who gets all tense and is trying to  just stomp, just stomp.  Don't do it.  Got the Bobo voice.  Yeah.  Oh, hey, how's that viral video, by the way?  Trying to suppress his anger.  He keeps talking on Twitter that he's going to get another video, Bobo. 
[00:39:00]  And he's teasing that that one will have his face in it.  It's going to have my face in it this type of rate.  And 19,000 views.  That's it, huh?  Boy, it's really taking over the world.  Mr. Melonigen.  Yeah, Mr. Melonigen.  Mr. Melonigen.  I don't know what he was talking about last night.  I was reading his tweets.  Yeah, yeah.  He's just rambling. 
[00:39:30]  Rambling.  I told him it looks like all of his posts look like he just threw Scrabble letters, looked  at it, and just typed in whatever he saw.  Does he like that you respond to his tweets now in mocking tone?  I think so.  He has sent me some direct messages.  Oh, God.  He does DM me occasionally that he is very happy that I'm following him.  That part, he's very happy about.  Why would I follow Bobo? 
[00:40:00]  I don't get it.  You know, he's a nice enough sort.  I mean, I...  He's a good boy.  Watching the Mets with my dogs.  Yeah.  He's not...  He's a very nice guy.  He's not at all a mean-spirited guy.  Yeah, that's why.  Yeah, you said he's watching the Mets with his dogs.  You know what he does when his team wins?  Yeah, what?  He gives his dogs a victory kiss.  No, he does.  No, he does.  We should do that to a shotgun.  How do you know he gives his dogs a victory kiss? 
[00:40:30]  He's told people on Twitter that that's what he does.  What's a victory kiss?  Oh, jeez.  On the lips?  Yeah, probably.  Full tongue.  Yeah.  Victory kiss with peanut butter?  Yeah, he fucking...  And, like, he...  He tongues the worms out of their anus.  He really thinks that...  Like, he tells people all the time that his dogs get excited when his teams win.  Oh.  Yeah.  Red racket.  Yeah, like, they really fucking...  Well, they're probably psyched because they know they're going to get a kiss on the genitals.  Yeah, they're like, all right, I'm going to get blown.  Yeah.  They're going to get the under-the-arm-pit ride,  which is when he lifts them up. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, he was watching the Met game with his dogs.  I asked him if he watches with his dogs so they could explain the game to him.  And he actually responds and goes,  You know I know about baseball.  Like, I had to be told that the dogs were indeed not explaining the game to young Bobo.  He does.  I mean, he knows more about baseball than the average dog does, to be fair to him.  Of course, we've heard during the dick down portions of his conversations, we've heard that he knows a lot about baseball. 
[00:41:30]  During dick up, he doesn't know much about women.  You mean when he's not clenching his fists and rubbing his fingers and going,  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, what a ghoul.  What a creep he is.  He has a lot of Hispanic on his.  Yeah, and then he is.  I am okay with the Hispanics.  My grandma, two words, is Hispanic. 
[00:42:00]  My grand am is from Nicaragua.  So I guess that's where he got his car.  Yeah, yeah.  People started joking about that.  Yeah, he's just started out of nowhere.  He starts these conversations out of nowhere.  He's posting about where his.  Nothing wrong with the Asians.  I got some friends that are Asian.  Where his ancestors came from.  And then I implied that all he did was go to Ancestry.com and put in cabbage.  And his ancestry comes up because he's a dolt. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I couldn't stop fucking tweeting about the bobo last night.  Well, he's convinced that the world needs to know these things.  Whatever fun facts about him pop into his head, he's going to share.  So it's like.  Out of nowhere.  It just.  He feels compelled.  I got to go charge my phone, tweet after it fully charged.  Stuff like that, you mean?  Yeah.  Thanks.  Thanks for that.  Eating dinner.  Going to walk the dogs.  Walk Mr. Melanogen. 
[00:43:00]  How does he spell it?  Melanogen?  Yeah.  How was he?  M-A-L-O-N-A-G-E-N?  Yeah.  Melanogen?  Melanogen.  Ding.  Yeah.  Yeah.  M-A-L-L-O-N-A-G-E-N.  Yeah.  Melanogen.  Melanogen.  He.  Big Met fan.  Yeah.  They won, so his dogs get a kiss.  And the Rangers won, so I wonder if they get two kisses. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, boy.  Unlike the Yankees.  So weird.  The Yankees did not win.  When I was at the Yankee game, of course, before I was going to go to the Yankee game,  Bobo was tweeting that he was going to the Met game.  He also tweeted that I would be at the Yankee game.  So we should both have a contest as to how many listeners will come up and take a picture  with you and tweet it.  So I'm like, yeah, yeah.  Spread that around, because that's how I want to spend my fucking afternoon at the ball game,  taking pictures with fans and tweeting it.  And he's like, I bet I get more than you. 
[00:44:00]  Who cares?  It is a good contest, though, because obviously Bobo from the Opie and Anthony show is more  well-known than Anthony from the Opie and Anthony.  He probably is, though.  You could look at him and go, that's got to be Bobo.  He's just tweeting some girl, please let me come on you someday.  No way.  Yes.  Right here.  I almost admire that.  Yeah.  That's a good one. 
[00:44:30]  Please let me come on you.  It's polite but tactless.  And then I'm not giving out my password.  Oh, see.  Is that still asking for his password?  I'm sure somebody asks for his password almost every day.  Yeah, yeah.  I've seen some of the people, the alleged girls that tweet him.  You know, they got four tweets, no followers.  No, catfished again.  The hottest fucking picture ever.  Yeah.  And they want to be friends with Bobo. 
[00:45:00]  What happened with the one in England?  Do you still talk to her?  Yeah, yeah.  She's still over there, you know, pretty batshit crazy.  Is she nutty?  But, yeah, she's kooky.  But I don't know if English people are just nutty anyway.  Are they?  You live there, Sam.  Maybe that's that British sense of humor.  Right.  It's called a dry sense of humor, I believe.  Yeah.  She broke Bobo's heart.  But she broke Bobo's heart.  How'd she break his heart, bitch?  Well, she just told him that, you know, they probably should calm down and not.  They should stop pretending to go out with each other.  Yeah, stop making believe that they have a 5,000-mile relationship with each other. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, so, well, yeah, the Yankees, again, just not looking very, very good.  I think we all knew.  I heard the stadium was quite empty in the late innings again.  I think you're going to see that a lot this season.  Yes, I think it's going to be a very lonely place.  But, finally, a couple of Yankees jacking the ball over the wall, which, of course, gets  us the home run call from John Sterling.  Now, with these new players, obviously new calls, new home run calls. 
[00:46:00]  You know John Sterling.  He's, you know, an A-bomb from A-Rod.  Yeah, yeah, things like that.  You won't be hearing that one this year.  Uh, what do you know?  Is he still playing?  Is he going to play this year?  I mean, no.  What do you know?  A text message from Teixeira.  Ugh.  Uh, ew.  Oh, it's terrible.  That's gross.  It doesn't even make sense.  Awful, it doesn't even make sense.  Uh, something grander, yeah. 
[00:46:30]  You're something sort of grandish.  You're something sort of grandish.  Now the thing is he has two for each player.  What?  Why?  Because he'll say, you're something sort of grandish, and then he'll do the  Grandy Man can.  The Grandy Man can.  Oh, the Grandy Man can.  He'll do, you're on the mark to share a text message from Teixeira.  Right.  And he's so greedy for attention that he has to do them both.  Now it's two.  At the same time, for the same call.  Could you see if he did 30 for each guy?  That's all right.  He just keeps going. 
[00:47:00]  How about this one?  Yeah.  Ah!  Uh, so, now what happened last night?  What, what, uh...  We have, uh, the first one is, is Travis Hafner.  Travis Hafner.  Hafner.  Uh, hits a home run, and we have the John Sterling call.  Do we want to do any predictions?  Uh, okay.  What's it, Hafner?  Hafner.  Maybe, maybe like, uh, that have to be Hafner.  Oh, that's a good one.  Um, um...  What's his first name?  Travis.  Travis.  Travis. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, this gay guy.  Yeah.  No?  Dr. Gay.  Yes.  Uh...  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Oh, it's Travis.  Uh...  Oh!  It is high!  Another miss audio clip!  That ball looks like Mom is outta here!  No?  Oh, no.  Oh, Mom is... 
[00:48:00]  Oh.  Oh, that was too mean.  Oh, that is very fucking mean.  I can't even...  Hafner.  Hafner.  Hafner goes all the way.  Haf.  No.  You know, the problem is that you guys think you're making bad jokes, but this is stuff  he probably considered in his head.  Of course he did.  He's sitting there like, he writes, Hafner, half, whole, whole run.  He's just crunching stuff out the whole time. 
[00:48:30]  Let's hear it.  All right.  Let's hear it.  Let's hear it.  Hafner.  The infielder closest to second.  Pedroia is way out in the outfield.  Iglesias stays it short, and Hafner swings and lifts a high fly to deep right center field.  Back goes up.  That ball is gone into the right center field bullpen.  Travis Hafner hit the ball out in right center into the Yankee bullpen.  Perfect.  So Travis becomes a Bronx bomber.  A Hafner homer and the Yankees trail 6-1. 
[00:49:00]  He's very lackluster, by the way.  Not very excited.  Those are his two.  A Bronx bomber, which I don't.  A Bronx bomber.  A Bronx.  What's Bronx?  I don't know.  Isn't it Bronx bomber?  Yeah.  A Bronx.  I don't get what Bronx.  You said Bronx, right?  Travis Hafner, Bronx.  What is he saying?  Is his middle name Bronx?  I don't think so.  Yeah.  Hafner Homer is just a lazy writer.  A Hafner Homer. 
[00:49:30]  Ladies and gentlemen.  Oh, his nickname, I guess, is Bronx.  Why?  Prank.  Why?  Let's see.  Hafner.  Ladies and gentlemen, it is high.  It is far.  It is gone.  Oh, okay.  A Hafner Homer.  His nickname, Prank, was given to him in 2001 when people sometimes referred to him  as The Project and other times Donkey for the way he looked when running the bases.  So, Project and Donkey.  That's why he was fired from his grammar school teaching job. 
[00:50:00]  He was pronking the youngsters.  So, they combined the two.  Fucking a woman from Tijuana as he's going around the bases.  Yeah, okay.  The Pranks.  So, that was very lacklustre.  A Hafner Homer.  Yeah.  All right.  A Pranks Bomber.  Pranks Bomber.  A Hafner Homer.  A Hafner Homer.  All right.  Who's the next one in the stunning Yankee lineup?  Well, this one, we've got a lot of options.  Oh.  Vernon Wells. 
[00:50:30]  Ah, Vernon Wells.  All right.  But Wells done.  Wells done.  Wells, Wells, Wells.  Yeah.  Wells, Wells.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's like, looks like he didn't go to the Wells one too many times.  Vernon.  Vernon hit it Wells.  Ah, that's a good one.  Very Vernon.  Now, I will tell you that in this clip, if you listen closely after he gives his little  home run call, someone enjoyed it. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, really?  There's a little off mic snickering from a certain co-host that we all love.  Nailed it.  That's hilarious.  That was a good one, John.  Hey, look, there's some peaches in my wig.  My wig's upside down and there's peaches in it.  Ah, Hafner new.  Look at the Yankee dugout.  No one's in it.  All right. 
[00:51:30]  Let's hear, um, let's say, well, well.  Well, that's easy.  Kind of a well, well, well.  Hit it well.  Welly well.  Yeah.  Well, welly well, well.  Let's, let's hear.  Wells come.  Oh.  Yeah.  Thank you for the homer.  Your wells come.  Oh.  All right.  Let's hear.  Now, here is Vernon Wells.  And he swings and lines one to left.  Bradley back.  Looking up.  That ball is gone. 
[00:52:00]  Vernon Wells drills a three-run home run in the lower seats and left.  The Bronx is Vernon.  Wells rings the bells.  He hits a three-run home run.  And the Yankees now trail seven-four.  Three-run homers and they can't, still can't win.  Assholes.  Um, I heard.  Wow.  I heard Susan laugh when he said the Bronx is Vernon.  Did you hear her laugh?  The Bronx is Vernon.  Yeah. 
[00:52:30]  What the fuck is that?  Wells rings the bells.  Instead of burning.  Yeah.  Vernon.  Vernon.  It doesn't even rhyme.  It doesn't.  She enjoyed that one, though.  It doesn't rhyme.  He was probably like, wait, I got a good one.  Who the fuck likes these calls?  Chip.  Susan Waltman.  Really?  Susan Waltman and Chip.  You're going to hear Susan giggle again?  Yeah.  That fucking shit was cracking me up or something.  Remember Chip Waltman?  Yes.  He's back.  I love him.  Chip Waltman.  I forgot about Chip Waltman. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, Joe.  I think another old run joke or something.  Now here's Vernon Wells.  And he swings and lines one to left.  Bradley back.  Looking up.  That ball is gone.  Vernon Wells drills a three-run home run in the lower seats in left.  The Bronx is Vernon.  Wells rings the bells.  You know why she's laughing?  Because as he said that, she spilled hot soup on his cup. 
[00:53:30]  Hot soup.  Oh, fuck.  That's bad.  And why two?  I mean, stop with the two now.  That's his new thing.  Everybody needs two.  I can understand if it's really good.  Everyone gets two.  But the Bronx is Vernon.  Yeah.  Oh, please.  If you didn't like that one, here comes another.  Yeah.  Well, that's, uh...  The Bronx, it's not even a play on...  It's not, no. 
[00:54:00]  Anything.  The Bronx is...  The Bronx is Vernon, but...  Yeah, but...  But what does that even mean?  His name's Wells.  Yeah.  Say Wells done.  Wells rings the bells.  Well, how about you just say, Vernon hit a home run?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  There you go.  I don't know what happened.  How about you don't make it about you?  Yeah.  How about that man's home run is not about you?  It's...  They're always about him.  How much attention does he need?  A lot.  We have to listen to you for nine innings.  Yeah, that's a lot.  Susan would be bored. 
[00:54:30]  She needs something to giggle at.  That's true.  She needs a little entertainment.  She likes a good chuckle.  She needs a little comic relief.  Exactly.  She loves a good chuckle, that one.  I guess she enjoyed that one.  She liked it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got a Bronx and Vernon.  Man, that's...  What was the final score of the Yankee game there last night?  Seven to four.  Seven to four.  So that was pretty much it.  We have another one?  Wow.  Another call?  Nope.  Just those two.  That was it.  A three-run homer.  And then one fucking...  So they never just drove someone in with a nice RBI last night? 
[00:55:00]  Just some home runs from some has-beens.  Jesus.  It's going to be a bad little season for the Yankees.  I'm looking forward to Kevin Uclis' home run call.  Yeah, that's true.  Lyle Overbay.  Ah.  I mean, there's just...  Overbay!  Over the wall!  Huh?  No?  Bronx Bomber.  It's so stupid.  It doesn't make any sense.  No.  All right.  You know what?  I'm going to have my brefixed, as they say. 
[00:55:30]  Same people that would say piscetti.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, like Kenny?  Doesn't know.  Like when we're out, he'll order piscettis.  Piscettis?  Yeah, he ordered.  We were in a restaurant.  He's like, can I have some piscettis, please?  Do you have an extra knack in?  Dude, we were in the cab, and he calls the cabbie, mister.  It's probably 30 times.  Is there going to be traffic, mister?  Do you think we'll get there on time, mister?  He follows everything up with mister. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, and then he's like, we want to go have some piscettis, mister.  And the cabbie was a Jamaican, and he goes, why are you playing da fool?  Playing da fool!  Because he is one.  It was so perfect.  The guy fucking called him out on it.  Ah, that's great.  All right.  Yeah, we'll take a little break.  We'll come back.  We'll do some more fun.  What's this, Todd Roskin is coming in at eight?  He's got Up the Valley and Beyond.  What is this?  A biopic? 
[00:56:30]  We saw this.  About legendary cult filmmaker.  Oh, Russ Meyer.  Yeah, Russ Meyer.  Yes.  The big booby guy.  Russ Meyer.  And Chris Jericho.  Coming in a little later.  That should be fun.  I want to talk to him about that robot wars.  That's what you've been looking forward to.  I mean, it's not a show for you, huh?  I don't know.  I like technology.  Yeah.  I own a drone.  You like to watch robots fight each other? 
[00:57:00]  We'll talk to Chris Jericho about that, and of course, WrestleMania.  And the Associated Press, of course.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  These fucking politically correct vomit bags.  Yeah, it's a ridiculous story, but totally on par with everything else that's going on  in this fuckwad world.  Carlin was so right about adding syllables.  Yeah.  You take out the humanity, and you think you're changing the condition by changing it.  He was so fucking, so fucking 35 years ahead of his time.  Amazing. 
[00:57:30]  Dumb fucks.  All right, everyone.  We'll be right back.  Welcome back to the finals of America's Got Genitals.  We've got four contestants left, and you at home will decide which genitals are America's  genitals.  Our judges are here.  Rich Voss.  What should the people at home be looking for in a penis? 
[00:58:00]  You take a nice one about this big, white, cut.  It's got to be cut.  You don't want it to look like a fucking horrible brown turtleneck, okay?  All right, let's take a look at Travis.  Judges, what are your final thoughts on the genitals?  I'm not sure what that was.  My vote is no.  Look at that.  That looks like a missile.  Nobody likes a ball like that.  It's like a grown man's penis with a young boy's balls.  All right.  Eric is our second finalist.  Eric, why don't you come out here and present your genitals? 
[00:58:30]  You are truly amazing.  I have to admit, you are making me a fan.  Oh, my God.  It's amazing.  It's amazing.  No, you don't think that's a nice peanut.  Look at the head.  Look at that.  It's perfect.  The shape and everything, the balls, the contrast.  It's a good presentation.  All right, let's keep it moving.  Danny is our third finalist.  Danny, show us what you got. 
[00:59:00]  I'm very confused by you.  Look, I had a lot of hope for you,  and all I saw is a guy with his pants off  and a rather small package, quite frankly.  See, that one isn't great because the balls are too tight.  Just an opinion.  And let's bring out our last finalist.  Let's give it up for Kenny.  My boyfriend, absolute perfection.  I am giving you a big yes.  Now, that's a perfect penis. 
[00:59:30]  You know what it is?  Look at the big balls behind it, you know,  and the head, like there's a little ridge,  so it's, you know, you'll, when you come down it,  you'll hit your, you know, like you'll know you hit the head.  You know what I mean?  It's fucking, that's a good one.  Okay, the judges have spoken.  We'll find out what America thought after this,  when America's Got Genitals continues.  I'm not, I'm not gay. 
[01:00:00]  Serious, serious accents.  The O'Pin' Anthony Show.  Are you lonesome tonight?  Do you miss me tonight?  Are you sorry we drifted apart?  You're welcome.  Comment?  Does your memory scream?  53 years ago we recorded this.  53 years ago. 
[01:00:30]  This was recorded.  Oh, when I kissed you.  And called you sweetheart.  Sweetheart.  Do the chairs in your boiler.  See you empty and bare.  Chairs in your boiler.  Do you gaze at your bald head.  And wish you had hair.  That was the line that got him.  He cracked himself up. 
[01:01:00]  No way, shall I come back?  Tell me, dear.  Are you lonesome?  Oh, Lord, Lord.  I wonder how...  You know, someone said,  the world's a stage and each must play a bar.  Do you think he was drugged up back then? 
[01:01:30]  Oh, God.  Oh, man, I'll tell you.  Oh, man, I'll tell you.  I like that woman just caterwauling in the background.  I had no calls to that.  You think anyone was pissed?  Like, sing the fucking song. 
[01:02:00]  I came here to hear you sing this, goddammit.  Yeah, it's my favorite.  I want to hear this.  I just like the fact that he started laughing at his own joke. 
[01:02:30]  There he goes.  Elvis, Elvis.  That was what you got for us today,  as far as this thing in musical history there at EROC?  Yeah.  That's it, huh?  Not satisfied, huh?  You don't really like it.  It's not a huge anniversary.  No, it's like, oh, it's a song.  It's fucking a long time ago.  But it's not like, you know, Elvis first released his first single X number of years. 
[01:03:00]  Right, right.  Just one of the songs he did.  Just one of the songs.  Do you think that was him being lazy?  There was a little laziness to it, sure.  It was, definitely.  I think it was kind of like, ah, the first thing I saw on the list.  I know it's easy to find this song.  Yeah, there it is.  Ovi's not here to yell at me.  You know, type of thinking.  Yeah, yeah.  That's kind of what I got out of that myself.  Which is kind of disrespectful to you, because it's like, well, you know.  I can do whatever I want when Anthony's here.  Exactly.  Right, right.  I'm like the substitute teacher. 
[01:03:30]  He doesn't want a public scene, so I can just throw a tantrum and get in my way.  Yeah, Eric's taking like 20 minute bathroom breaks, because you're the son.  It's amazing for someone who doesn't want a public scene, that you'll bullhorn the N-word  out a fucking car window for a fucking guy not moving at the light.  Yeah, well, you've got to pick your spots.  Yeah, really make them count, right?  Where it's really important.  Right.  When it's important, I'll make a scene.  Looks like I won't be going to L.A. as much come February 2014. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, yeah.  Tonight's show is moving.  Moving to New York with Jimmy Fallon.  Yeah, that's pretty big news.  You think you'll be doing the Tonight Show here in New York?  I'm sure I'll do.  Yeah, sure.  But, I mean, it's not...  I enjoyed going out there.  That was fun.  That was a lot of fun.  Yeah, now it's, you know, no more red-eye flights out there to do that.  No, that's true.  Now he's no more frequent flyer miles.  Like, I enjoyed those trips.  You did?  Yeah, it was fun just going out there and doing a quick thing. 
[01:04:30]  They'd fly you first class, too, right?  How cute did he ask?  Yeah, they get a fucking rate.  It's like paying business.  Yeah, yeah.  They get a cheap rate.  But it made sense.  I was reading a...  I get why they did it.  Yeah.  Because, yeah, I mean, Lauren's going to be the executive producer.  And he said...  They said behind the scenes he pushed NBC.  And he said, how much of a head start do you want to give Kimmel?  That kind of makes sense.  Like, they figured that that's going to be his competition in ten years. 
[01:05:00]  In five years.  So it's like, why let Kimmel get a tremendous foothold and then throw Jimmy into it five  years from now?  Yeah.  And Carson left when he was number one.  I mean, that was when Jay took over.  Johnny was number one, so...  Yeah, yeah.  Although Johnny didn't fucking have the competition that Jay did.  No, not now.  I mean, it's, you know, everybody's got a fucking late night show.  I don't know that, but, like, I think this will work well.  He's a likable guy.  Yeah.  Not going to upset anybody?  No, no.  Like Leno.  The guests like him.  Yeah. 
[01:05:30]  You know, he knows a lot of people from, like, his SNL days and stuff that he's built  up relationships with, has them on the show.  I think there would be a lot less weirdness around this whole thing right now if they  hadn't fucked up the last thing so badly.  Like, if Leno had just been allowed to just take the Tonight Show the full way until now,  people would be like, okay, I get it.  Yeah, cool.  But that was that Conan debacle and all that stuff.  I wonder if he's going to go to Fox.  I've heard that rumor that Fox would want him. 
[01:06:00]  I hope not.  Leno, yeah.  Yeah, I would only want him to go there if he did well.  I would feel bad for him if he went there and didn't do well.  Yeah.  I mean, I don't know if he would do well.  Like, I think part of people watching Leno is the tradition of it.  And it's like, he's not doing new stuff.  He's doing his stuff.  And, like, he can't go someplace else and do it.  It's like that fucking Oprah thing, you know?  Oprah is fucking killing on her Oprah show.  And then she decides to spin off her own dumb network.  And no one's watching it. 
[01:06:30]  Well, no one knows where she is either.  And no one knows when she's on.  Honestly, no one fucking knows where Oprah Winfrey, her fucking channel is.  Yeah.  I don't know where it is.  My friend runs it.  I have no idea where you can watch it.  It's on own.  And then it's like, yeah, where's that?  What is that?  Is it next to Channel 2?  No.  I like the old people that were scared of Conan and wouldn't watch his show.  They will watch Jimmy Fallon's show.  Yes, they will.  Jimmy Fallon, you know, he's like their sweet grandson or something. 
[01:07:00]  That is true.  The older demo does like him because he's a nice boy.  He's a nice boy.  That Conan O'Brien was not a nice boy.  He makes fun of people.  He's very different.  He's very quirky.  I don't like him.  He looks very scary, too, with the hair.  And he's very big.  But that Jimmy Fallon, he's just like my grandson.  Right.  And Fallon and Travis raised his point in break.  Fallon and Kimmel do viral stuff, which both of them are really good at that.  Good for the younger demo there.  Yeah.  I mean, as young as you're going to get a late night demo. 
[01:07:30]  That's what they want, though.  But they're never going to get the audience they're looking for.  They're not going to get.  They're never going to have a 30-year-old demo.  But that audience is going to grow with them.  You know?  At least it'll establish the brand with, like, at least the Tonight Show brand will mean something to young people.  Like, at least they'll go.  Like, even if Leno started putting out videos online, young people are not going to watch Jay Leno videos on the Internet.  They're going to watch Kimmel and Fallon videos.  Yeah.  Yeah, because they're younger guys.  Yeah.  But even they can't.  And you're going to stay with them. 
[01:08:00]  Plus, like, who are they?  Like, look at who Kimmel and Fallon are buddies with, like, celebrity-wise.  It's like Justin Timberlake and Matt Damon.  It's not like, you know, the older crowd.  Leno, uh, he knows how to, uh, get transmission fluid on his hands.  Right.  Yeah?  He gets on, he'll get under a car.  It's just this hatred people have of Jay.  I, I, I guess I'm very biased, but I just fucking.  I don't know where it comes from.  I have no idea.  Especially comics.  It's like, you know what I mean?  Like, he's nice to comedians.  Well, comics have fucking mental patients anyway. 
[01:08:30]  But it's like, that's the guy that comes in and talks to you.  It's like, why would you think that the guy's a douchebag if he fucking treats you nicely?  That's the hip thing.  That's.  Is to, is to not like, it's not cool to like Jay Leno, even though he does, he does what he does extremely well.  He's fucking.  Nobody's been as successful as him doing this, you know?  But just these guys who are like, oh, his monologue stinks.  His monologue is fucking, he says, usually he has the fucking best monologue.  He's fucking edgier than the other guy.  It just makes me good.  No material every night on current topics.  Yeah, man, so do they all. 
[01:09:00]  I mean, that's a fucking hard thing to do.  Yeah.  I've never watched Ferguson's show.  I don't know what he does at all.  He apparently does well.  I mean, they keep renewing his, his, his contract.  I think he's just got his own thing going.  But I wonder if Letterman's going to be squeezed out for Ferguson.  I don't think there's.  Turd Ferguson?  Turd Ferguson, right?  Yeah.  I don't think there's as much of a sense of urgency.  That's my name.  Turd.  Look how big this hat is.  It's a giant cowboy hat.  Fucking Norm doing Turd Ferguson.  Turd Ferguson.  It's hilarious.  That's not my name. 
[01:09:30]  The, uh, Fallon in New York now, that changes the dynamic of the whole show.  Yeah, I think it's a smart move.  I mean, this is where they're, they're based.  And then, you know, fucking Lauren's empire is based out of New York.  Yeah, yeah.  He can get, Lauren Michaels can get people.  That's the one thing.  Yeah, yeah.  Lauren will get the guess for Fallon.  Right.  You know, he's got a lot more pull than Kimmel does.  He's not just a booker.  He's fucking Lauren Michaels.  And he, he wields some power in the biz. 
[01:10:00]  He almost had the fucking Beatles reunited.  Yeah.  He almost had the Beatles reunited on TV.  Lauren gets, he'll get, you know, I bet you, I don't know if he'll get Nicholson, because  he doesn't do any TV.  But if anyone's going to get guys like that, it'll be.  He got De Niro for the first Fallon show.  The first show.  Yeah.  That was a tough interview, too.  Yeah.  Oh, that is like, wow, what a fucking, that's a tough first interview.  Yeah.  Christ.  Yeah, because De Niro's not fucking chatty. 
[01:10:30]  Yes.  No.  Even Letterman has to work with those guys, like, and he's a great interviewer.  Yeah.  I saw footage of him talking to like, uh, Dustin Hoffman and De Niro together.  They're promoting something.  And did you see that where De Niro just accidentally threw the brakes on everything?  Oh.  Did you ever see that?  No.  Can you find fucking Dustin Hoffman and De Niro on, I'm thinking it was one of these.  Oh, on Letterman.  I think I remember that clip because they were promoting one of the Meet the Parents movies. 
[01:11:00]  Oh, God.  And De Niro was being sincere.  He wasn't trying to be a dick, but you could just see.  But he just stinks on, on interview shows.  There we go.  How long is it?  There's one that's five minutes and then there's the longer one that's ten minutes.  Can we do the shorter one?  Go to like the middle of it with Dustin Hoffman.  Let me, show me.  I'll tell you if that's the one.  Oh, it's an advert first.  There's an advert.  Because De Niro.  I mean, it's, it's the same interview.  There's just one that was, that's five minutes long and one that's ten minutes.  But you could see, even Letterman has to work with these guys. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Do you think it was a tough interview?  Fuck yeah.  Hoffman's a little easier, but alone, he's not great either.  None of these, I've never seen Pacino.  You know, weird, they just aren't good on talk shows.  If they don't have a script and a fucking camera rolling in front of them, they don't  know what to do.  Have a conversation.  No, they can't just have a conversation.  I wonder if it's because they're so fucking pliant as, as people, their psyches, they  can become so many, that's why they're such great actors.  You have to be a void, an empty vessel.  Well, yeah, maybe, I don't know what that is. 
[01:12:00]  What was that?  That was more of a clip thing.  I want the actual, this is going to be the actual.  I was going to go to the middle of it, let me see.  It says part one.  Jesus.  He must have had them on the whole show, right?  No, the first two.  Really?  You don't have fucking De Niro and Dustin Hoffman on for the entire show as a guest?  Who do you bring out after that?  Ryan Gosling?  Jim Norton?  Or a woman or a singer?  Look, yeah. 
[01:12:30]  You just want to listen to it?  Yeah, crank it up.  Let me hear some of this.  This is like how...  De Niro sitting closer to Letterman.  What an ovation.  Could you pull that mic?  Just that little bulb at the end.  There we go.  Wow.  Now they just sit there like, hey, look, it's us.  He's kissing De Niro on the head.  I wouldn't have thought Dustin Hoffman was taller than De Niro. 
[01:13:00]  Wow.  He is, uh...  He definitely is.  That's got to be the longest ovation.  Oh, my God.  All right.  We get it.  They're legends.  What are you going to do?  You find out if the Dustin fans started stabbing the De Niro fans and vice versa?  All right, already.  Take control, Dave.  Yeah.  Maybe they asked for this because they were like, look, we really don't have a lot to say.  Yeah, Dave knows it, too.  Yeah, yeah.  The more applause, the better.  Let's just kill two minutes here. 
[01:13:30]  Holy shit.  Jesus Christ.  I hate to have to follow that.  All right.  Appearing at the improv.  Thank you.  We're out of time.  Good to see you.  Glad to have you both here.  Welcome to the show, gentlemen.  Nice to see you.  See you.  See you.  See you.  What is it you're here together?  We've both left our wives.  Oh. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, boy.  Cocksuckers.  I sure would like to help you both out, but...  Uh, Dustin Hoffman, of course, you've been here several times.  We've gotten to know you over the years.  Thank you very much for your time.  Thank you for having me.  You see, Letterman's just not sure.  Wow.  It's the first time Mr. De Niro has been here.  Thank you very much for being here.  You know...  Yeah.  Yeah.  He goes, yeah.  Shakes his head. 
[01:14:30]  Nothing to add.  No.  He's just...  This is...  For the first three minutes, we have...  We've been on the air for 30 years.  ...see you and yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What did he say to him?  It's been 30 years.  Well, right now we're on CBS.  We used to be on NBC.  I live in your neighborhood.  Literally your neighborhood.  I know.  I know.  We're neighbors, and this is your first time.  And, uh...  What have I done?  Oh, God.  I don't know.  I just, uh...  Well, whatever.  Dustin will explain to you. 
[01:15:00]  Dustin will explain.  Dustin will explain.  All right.  All right, Dustin.  What's the story?  He's got nothing.  If you ask me the questions that you have designated for Bob, I can maybe answer.  You know, this is not a legal proceeding.  De Niro is just sitting there.  Terrible.  The De Niro Whisperer.  But that's the fucking power that guy has in Hollywood. 
[01:15:30]  Like, you can't stop looking at dumb De Niro.  It's...  Go ahead.  It's such a coup to get him on the show.  Yeah, no, I have been on that.  And I always send little cards back there.  Yeah.  Little jokes back there.  Yeah, and I read them to the audience.  Oh, you do?  Yeah, yeah.  And they say, well, that's great.  How come he ain't here?  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  You guys are, uh, close in age.  Uh, I believe Mr. Hoffman is a little older than you. 
[01:16:00]  Is that about right?  A little bit.  Yeah.  A little bit older.  Yeah.  A little bit.  A little bit.  Did you start in the same class, uh, in terms of, uh, actors, uh, young actors working in New York?  I can say one thing, which, uh, I've done about, I guess, about four films.  Woo!  And, uh, it was only the last film.  I guess it was Little Fuckers.  Uh, Chip likes that.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, it sounds like fuckers.  Yeah, it does, Chip.  I said, I said, I pronounced it right. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  And suddenly we're in between takes and Bob says to me, uh, out of nowhere, which is his  movie, but won't, uh, he said, you remember 1969 when you did, uh, Midnight Cowboy, and  I said, oh, there's the applause, applause break for Midnight Cowboy.  It's a cool story, though.  How is it?  I wasn't begging, uh, and I said, yes, I remember doing that film.  He says, do you remember the, uh, the party afterwards? 
[01:17:00]  And I said, kind of, not really.  He says, he says, he says it was on Second Avenue on, like, 34th Street or something.  I said, really?  How, how, how do you know?  He said, I was your waiter.  Whoa.  Wow.  Wow.  No, and actually, what it was, was, um, it was, um, a thing for McCarthy.  Oh.  That time.  I got it wrong?  And it was the night that Bobby Kennedy was assassinated. 
[01:17:30]  Wow.  That's an up story.  Wow.  Well, he brought a good story down.  Oh, that's, oh, that's where he put the brakes on.  Holy shit.  Oh.  I'm sure Dave is wishing fucking Sirhan Sirhan came in.  Oh, Bob, I know you got a car waiting.  He fucking, son.  He fucking brought the whole story down. 
[01:18:00]  It was a fun story.  Uh, I mean, sadly enough, but, you know, that's, uh, sadly it is our lives.  Uh, and you talk about, uh, Robert Duvall and Gene Hackman.  Were you in that group as well?  Well, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  He, him.  I'm talking to him.  Yeah, yeah.  He was not in that group.  He's trying to get something out of De Niro.  He was almost a generation younger.  He will never stop.  Yeah.  And the first film that you guys worked together on was, uh, was Wag the Dog?  Wag the Tail?  Wag the Tail. 
[01:18:30]  Sleepers.  Sleepers.  Yeah.  Who else was in the film?  Uh, Robert Duvall.  Yeah.  Was it?  My God.  And you could stop.  It's like pulling teeth.  I know.  It's terrible.  I've got to get a picture with De Niro.  You'll never get a picture with De Niro.  I should have asked him at the comedy cellar that night.  I just didn't.  You will never get a picture with him.  Yes, I will.  I say no.  I will.  No.  He's being intentionally a bad guest, though, it seems like.  No.  I think he's just that dull. 
[01:19:00]  He's just shy.  I think he's just an idiot.  He's probably panicking in front of all those people, too.  You think he's shy?  Yeah, of course.  He's a shy guy?  I bet he is.  Wow.  Yeah, he is.  I've met him.  He is.  You get a picture?  Well.  No.  You know, it's funny, Travis.  I did not.  But I did hear him laughing during my set.  That was the highest.  That's amazing.  Loudly.  In a back.  Was he?  My next joke bombed because I heard fucking that laugh in the back.  Was it a Max Cady laugh with a cigar and everything? 
[01:19:30]  It was Max Cady or Rupert Pupkin.  Rupert Pupkin.  Rupert Pupkin, yeah, but it was unmistakably him.  That's awesome.  Yeah.  Do you have it on tape?  I have the tape for that night, but of course my fucking faggot, cocksucker fucking flip  cam wasn't working properly.  So I don't have the best audio of it, but if you listen really closely, you can hear him  in the back.  The flip cam.  What happened to those?  They stunk.  Yeah.  I got this GoPro now, and I'm trying to learn how to use it.  The iPhone app is so good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  For it. 
[01:20:00]  And it's on this little stand.  They look like little feet.  So what I'll do is if I see a girl, I'll go, itty bitty bitty, like Twinkie.  Itty bitty bitty bitty.  Like Twinkie.  Look, it's little cameraman.  Show your cunt.  Itty bitty bitty.  She gets a kick out of this.  What are you using your GoPro for?  You making little movies?  Well, no.  I want to do something with a chip driving show or something.  That would be good.  I know it would be.  Just slap that on the windshield.  Oh, Jesus.  Stupid.  Just take a compliment.  Stupid.  Yeah, why don't you take a shit?  I don't have to, asshole. 
[01:20:30]  It does take amazing, like, video from the vehicle when you put that suction cup thing  on the windshield.  Yeah.  So I use it for my comedy song.  I'm taping live at Gotham tonight on AXS TV or AXS TV.  Oh.  So, uh, I don't think.  It's live, right?  It is.  It goes out live.  So I was working out material to do because I can't really do stuff I did in my special.  Yeah.  And I forgot certain jokes that I haven't, that was doing that.  I just stopped doing it.  I'm like, oh, okay, that will fucking work. 
[01:21:00]  And I was really fun last night at the cellar.  So I've been taping with this.  Oh, goody.  I bought a mic for it.  It's a big, fluffy, hairy mic.  Oh, is it?  It's terrible.  Yeah, it's embarrassing.  And where do you have it?  Up on stage?  I don't know where it goes.  No, I haven't used it.  I don't know where it goes.  It plugs into it, like, uh, I don't know if it plugs into this.  Yeah, it plugs in.  There's a little jack on the side to pull one of the little rubber things out, I think.  Yeah, USB, but.  Yeah, something.  It looks cool filming shit on the outside of the car, too.  That is cool.  When you just suction it to the outside of the window. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah, you suction it to, like, the side and get, like, part of the tire.  The wheel shot and everything.  It looks like a fucking movie.  Doesn't it fall off?  No.  No, that shit is on.  Tight.  One time, I drove to the post office with it on my car.  And it's cool, right?  It's so cool.  It looks like fucking, fucking Miami Vice.  And then you're like, oh, I gotta put this up on YouTube.  And then you're like, nobody wants to see me drive to the post office.  No one wants to see that.  I'd watch that.  You would?  Yeah.  I have to.  Especially if it ended with the camera flipping over and over down a ditch.  I haven't done one of those drive home videos in a while. 
[01:22:00]  Last week would have been a good time to do it.  Because I might have gotten in a little trouble.  What happened?  Well, I didn't get in trouble.  But I could have.  Probably good if you didn't tape it, then.  I pulled something that could have been a little...  What do you mean?  Well, the stupid fucking people at the Midtown Tunnel toll booths are assholes. 
[01:22:30]  I fucking can't stand those motherfuckers.  Just open up all the gates, put EasyPass there, and just get rid of all of them.  It's so weird that they still have pay windows anywhere.  Like, on the Henry Hudson Bridge, they made it so that there are no pay windows.  And you can drive through them without an EasyPass.  They just mail you a ticket.  They'll mail you a fucking thing.  They'll mail you a bill.  Yeah.  Just fucking...  Here's what they do at the tunnel in the morning. 
[01:23:00]  They leave one EasyPass open.  And one cash thing open.  And there's barely any traffic.  But now it's all backed up.  Even though there isn't much traffic.  Because there's no fucking...  There's one EasyPass open.  They do that to keep their jobs.  Because they don't want fucking EasyPass to take all their jobs away.  So, um...  That really didn't have to do with that part of it.  I was coming out of the tunnel. 
[01:23:30]  To the toll booth on the Queens side.  And, uh...  There's an asshole in front of me the entire way through the tunnel.  Which drives me batshit.  Yeah.  When the speed limit's like 40 in the tunnel.  And they're doing 20.  And they're scared of the fucking...  If you can't fucking drive through the tunnel...  Go through the...  Don't go up to the Queensborough Bridge.  Take a fucking bridge, you pussy.  If you can't fucking zip through that tunnel...  Without thinking you're gonna bounce off the walls.  You shouldn't be driving. 
[01:24:00]  So, uh...  So now I'm fucking...  I'm pissed that I'm behind this fucker.  Now we pop out of the tunnel.  And of course there's one EasyPass lane open.  Again.  So this asshole...  I gotta be behind him still.  So he pulls up to the fucking toll thing.  And stops.  And doesn't go through.  I'm leaning on the horn.  Now what is happening during this time?  It's the crossover where they get the zipper lane.  And they have to close it down...  For the morning and afternoon. 
[01:24:30]  They're shifting the wall.  Yeah.  So I didn't know this.  But there was a guy...  A toll guy...  Standing in front of the lane...  Stopping people from going through.  Because they were bringing the truck through.  I didn't see him.  Because it was a...  It was a minivan in front of me.  That asshole that wasn't moving.  So when I beeped...  The guy that was in front of the minivan...  Stopping him.  Kind of peeked around.  And I saw him.  So I was like...  Oh.  You know, whatever.  My bad.  My bad.  But I didn't acknowledge anything. 
[01:25:00]  So then the minivan now moves.  And I go...  I never wait for the gate to go down.  And then back up again.  I just fucking go.  The gate stays up.  If you follow right through.  Do you think people panic?  They panic.  Ugh.  So now...  I'm trying to get around the guy.  So I'm like...  I come right out of the gate.  And I fucking go around to the right.  The guy now...  The tall guy is pissed at me.  So he jumps in front of my vehicle. 
[01:25:30]  Jumps right in front of my vehicle.  Why would you do that to stop me?  To somebody who's racing through a gate.  Like, he's obviously not in the mood to be stopped by anyone.  He's trying to stop me.  To yell at me.  Give me a ticket.  Whatever.  I would have no part of it.  I cut the wheel over.  And fucking gas it.  And I see him now out of my peripheral.  Because he's on the passenger side.  As I'm passing by him.  And he's lunging at my vehicle.  Like he wants to grab the door handle or something. 
[01:26:00]  Boop!  I just speed away.  I look in my rear view mirror.  And I see him standing there looking at me.  So I'm like, oh fuck.  He's getting my plate.  Yeah.  And now I'm looking like, are they going to send the car after me?  Because they got some shit.  So the first exit, I get off of the expressway.  And I take a few side streets.  And I jump back on the expressway.  And I have not taken the tunnel since.  Because you might run into that dude again? 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  I take the, well home.  I take it there.  Going to work.  But on the way home, I've been going to the Queensborough Bridge.  Why?  Because if you got my plate, I'm thinking they're all waiting for me to come through.  What were you doing wrong?  Like not stopping for this guy who asked you to stop.  They're going to have a whole army of officers just waiting for you.  Oh, believe me.  He wanted me to stop.  But he didn't say stop.  And I couldn't hear him over the growl of my engine peeling out.  I don't know what you're talking about.  What?  That's crazy that he lunged for your car. 
[01:27:00]  It's a moving vehicle.  He lunged to get in front of my vehicle to stop me.  And I would have no part of it.  No.  I was like, I had to swerve to avoid hitting him.  That's all you're telling me.  I thought you just stumbled out in front of me.  Exactly.  That's what I did.  Did he see you?  Oh.  I wasn't making eye contact.  I was looking at the road.  Maybe it was my wife.  I was looking at the road.  Yeah.  No.  Someone else was driving my car.  But if they really wanted you and they had your plates. 
[01:27:30]  They would have got you already.  It's not like they're just waiting at that.  This is how police investigations work.  Waiting at the one toll booth.  They'll be back.  You trust me on this one.  Here's the reason, though.  Because they only have jurisdiction over a certain amount of space around the toll plaza.  If you're the toll guys.  You know, the fucking bridge and tunnel police.  Port Authority.  Port Authority police.  You only have, like, really that authority.  You can't go chasing someone down the expressway like that. 
[01:28:00]  But, if I come wheeling through and they see it's me, now I'm in their fucking turf.  But isn't it all, like, at this point, isn't it all hearsay and he said, she said?  Yeah.  I just figured I'd wait.  I'll probably take the tunnel today.  She said, she said.  Don't be a baby.  How long ago?  I'll take the bridge.  Like, two years ago?  No.  It was last week.  It's not going to hold up if he says that.  No, of course it's not.  But here's the deal.  I don't even want to fucking be stopped.  I like deals. 
[01:28:30]  Oh, yeah?  You like the deal?  Plus, you're going through easy pass.  You're not stopping to pay.  Well, that's true.  But if they're all standing there like an army looking at every plate.  I know they're not.  Psycho.  I know they're not.  But I figured I'd let the heat blow over for a while.  The heat blew over.  As soon as you're off the exit.  Master criminal.  The fucking heat blew over.  Master criminal.  Ant loves the idea of being on the lam.  I was on the lam.  I was.  You still think you are.  I can't go back through that tunnel. 
[01:29:00]  I'm a little dangerous.  But here's why.  I can't.  I'm a rebel.  I'm a rebel, Dottie.  Yeah.  I never even knew you could do that.  Like, you could just keep going through the gate once it's up.  Dude, here's another thing I do every day that I go through those.  I try to see how close I could get that gate to brush my windshield.  I'm not even kidding.  I go through, even with the gate, so fast that that gate pops up and just misses the 
[01:29:30]  windshield.  And I don't stop.  I'm a continuing fucking rocket.  What if it smashes your windshield?  I've hit them once.  Once.  The guy yelled at me.  They're foamy.  They're foamy.  How do you have incidents with these people?  And they're on a spring.  I've never interacted with anybody at these toll pauses.  It's not like old wooden one from a movie.  Right.  They're foamy and they're springy.  So you hit it.  And that's what happened.  It hit my windshield.  It bent over.  And the guy's like, hey, hey, hey. 
[01:30:00]  They love yelling, those people.  They love yelling at people.  You can't wait literally the one second it would take?  No.  No, I can't.  They're tired of guys like you.  You know what?  Be like Jersey and get rid of your fucking dumb gates.  And the people in Jersey are stupid too because there's no gates.  And they stop to see if it says, okay, easy pass on the little light.  Just drive.  But the reason that there are still people stationed at these toll booths is because of you. 
[01:30:30]  No.  They're like, look at their drivers like this guy.  We need to have some kind of force there.  They wouldn't need anyone there if they would get rid of the gates, get rid of the fucking  plaza thing.  Just put a goddamn big metal superstructure with your little sensors over it and leave  it at that.  That's what they do at like the outer bridge.  It's great.  Yeah, just fly right there.  You don't even know you're putting a toll.  It's a fucking treat.  Those assholes down there.  Their fault.  Yeah, I always assumed.  Yeah, it's their fault.  I always got afraid that if you sped through the easy pass thing. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  That they would mail you a ticket.  No.  It never happens.  I've shot through those things like, you ever see the original Battlestar Galactica when  they take off in the fucking thing?  That's how I go through those things.  So you don't really like slow down on your full highway speed when you go through the  easy pass.  I'm fucking going.  I'm going pretty fast.  I'm probably doing 30.  I'm probably doing 30.  You're doing 30 through the ones with the gates.  With the gates.  Yes.  With the gates.  And it goes up. 
[01:31:30]  I do take a chance that it's not going to go.  It's a thrill.  You just said nobody else.  I've never met anybody who's like, oh yeah, one time, one time the gate hit my windshield.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like they can explain to you, no, it's okay because it's happened to me.  And when I'm behind somebody, when that gate doesn't go up because they're stupid, they  don't put the easy pass on their windshield for some fucking reason.  They have to pull it out of the fucking console, hold it up.  I'll tell you who does that.  Psychotic Kenny. 
[01:32:00]  Why?  Because he likes, he just, it's, it's more control.  He pulls it out and he neatly puts it on the thing and then he, his, his fucking dry  hand removes it and puts it under the radio with his, that perfect little slot.  You know who else does that?  Who?  Me.  Why?  I don't know.  I'll tell you why.  Why is the reason?  I'll tell you why.  Because like radar detectors, these dummies think someone's going to break in and steal  their easy pass.  Oh, stop it.  It's in my side, side of my door.  And then I pull it out like, you know, just a little before the tow booth and I put it  up on the windshield like that and then put it back in the side. 
[01:32:30]  Well, then Jim, it has nothing to do with, with fearing that it's going to be stolen  because you can just put it up there when you get in the car and then take it off.  And let me, and let me tell you something else about that whole fucking, the rigmarole  there.  That's why people are going so slow.  If you're going toward the tow plaza and the guy's reaching, he's there, he's trying  to find the easy pass, he's putting it up, he's not going as fast as he could be if  it's just on the windshield and he's driving, like me.  You're only supposed to go 10 miles an hour through the easy pass.  Fuck that. 
[01:33:00]  Fuck that.  And, uh, E-Rock, comment.  Well, I did the same thing too.  I have it tucked off to the floor.  Why?  It's just out of habit though.  Just put it on your windshield.  No one has a reason why.  They give you the adhesive to do so.  Don't give me the Tony Soprano, you don't want anyone tracking you while you're not going  through the tow booth.  No, because it's still in the car.  I mean, it's exactly, you know, it's not doing it.  It's not that.  And yeah, I don't stick the adhesive.  Why don't you fucking just put it up on the windshield?  It's OCD.  Maybe it is OCD.  It is.  Both guys who do this are OCD. 
[01:33:30]  Kenny and Sam.  Yeah, it has nothing to do with, you're not worried about it.  If they like things to be perfect and neat and they don't want to stick the things to,  I don't want to stick it.  I can't stick it to my windshield.  You put it up where, you sit, you sit in your fucking, you sit in your car.  That's where I hold it.  You look where the mirror is and then you, you hide it behind the mirror  so you never have to even see it.  You know, you could literally just put it on your lap.  Like, you don't have to.  Oh, yeah.  Even the gate doesn't go up and fucking, I'm stuck behind you.  No, don't put it on your lap, people. 
[01:34:00]  Sometimes in Jess's car, because she holds it up too, but I think she just did it.  She does it because you're doing it.  Because she thinks that's...  She probably hates it.  Yeah, but...  Oh, stick it on the windshield.  She'll hold it up and I'll go, you're not doing it right and I'll take it from her  because she's got the arrows pointing to her instead of the arrows pointing out.  And I said the arrows, because the arrows have to point out.  That's why the arrows are there.  Oh, my God.  Just put it on the windshield.  Would you stick it on a fucking windshield?  I do it on mine and you never know it's there.  I know you're afraid it'll fall off and scrape something. 
[01:34:30]  I don't know.  I just, you know, I'd rather...  No one has a reason why they do that.  No one.  No one's that important.  It's just that you can't have it on your windshield.  I call it a preference.  Personal.  It's stupid.  Personal preference.  It's stupid.  And it ties up traffic behind you.  But I go, but I mean, it ties up traffic of people trying to go like 40 miles an hour  through the easy path.  Exactly, which is what we should all be doing.  It's posted.  10 miles an hour.  I get it up there in time.  And then I put it away once I'm done with it.  Safekeeping.  For safekeeping.  Right in the side pocket.  I always know where it is. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  In the side pocket.  I know where mine is.  It's in my windshield.  Yeah, mine's...  I never think about mine.  I drive.  The fucking thing goes up.  You know what I'm actually going to do?  What?  I'm going to give...  We always do this sometimes.  No, we always do this sometimes.  We always do this sometimes.  Yeah, I always do this sometimes.  It sounds like a contradicted of terms.  Contradictive.  Oh, boy.  We test the waters of the callers.  You know, usually we don't take calls. 
[01:35:30]  But...  And by the way, most of the time when you test the waters on one of these shows, it does  not end well.  Doesn't.  You're right, though.  But I want to hear from Scrambler in Chicago about what happens with his experience with  the tolls in Chicago.  Hey, Scrambler from Chi-Town.  Guys in my car club call me Scrambler.  The Scrambler.  Hey.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  We have the...  They call it open road tolling, so we drive through at full speed.  Yeah, I love that.  Two lanes wide. 
[01:36:00]  And then, you know, there's obviously the distance between the tolls, and you can figure  out speed based on distance versus time.  Yeah.  Anthony knows that.  Sure.  And they used to be able to take your average speed.  This was a long time ago, eight, ten years ago.  They would take your average speed.  If you were averaging 75 at a 55, they would mail you a ticket for an average speeding ticket.  I've heard that, but I've heard it's also completely fabricated and never really happened.  I just got a text. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  Speaking of Letterman.  No, they can't do it now.  Sorry, Scrambler.  All right.  Well, thank you, Scrambler.  Yeah, why don't you go scramble some eggs or something?  Fucking home run.  That was good.  Justin Stangle from David Letterman.  Oh, okay.  I got a letter in the mail from EasyPass people saying I drove through the EasyPass lane  too fast, and if I do it again, my EasyPass will be canceled.  Oh.  Wow.  That's what I'm afraid of.  How fast was he going?  I don't know, but there's a posted thing.  Probably 70 with a child tied up in the trunk, and you left fucking a little hair ribbon on 
[01:37:00]  the fucking gate.  I would assume he was going through the Henry Hudson.  He's a Westchester person like me.  Oh, okay.  Is he really?  Oh, yeah.  So no gate, right?  No gate.  No gate.  No gate.  Yeah, you could really go through pretty fucking fast with no gate.  Right.  How do they know how fast you're going?  It's computers.  They got radar?  Yeah.  They got radar.  They got video cameras.  They got stories.  Scanners.  If they can, if all you have to do, you don't even have to have to have an EasyPass. 
[01:37:30]  You drive through, and they'll mail you the toll ticket.  They probably got the technology to figure out how fast you went through.  Everyone gets all scared.  How about this?  People are petrified that they're doing something wrong.  We have the Hubble telescope.  Which can almost see the big bang happening.  We can figure out how fast you're zipping through the fucking Midtown.  I think, yeah.  Yeah, true.  Oh, yeah.  Mike from Rockland County over there has a little EasyPass and blah-de-blah.  Hey, what's up there, Mike? 
[01:38:00]  Hey, how you doing, Anthony?  What's up, guys?  Yeah, listen.  I have the same experience as a guy who texted Sam.  I went through the EasyPass at about 40 miles an hour, and I go through it every day on the Tappan Zee Bridge.  And I got a letter in the mail saying, I'm on probation for six months, and if I do it again, they're going to take my EasyPass away.  And that's crazy.  Was it on the Tappan Zee, they have those 30-mile-per-hour EasyPass lanes?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  And if you go 10 miles over it.  And you know what?  It might have been my third or fourth offense.  There you go. 
[01:38:30]  Boy.  You know, when you're sitting in traffic, Anthony, it's the morons and the funnier.  You want to just get to work.  Yes, when that traffic opens up, that's when I'm very vulnerable to a ticket, because I will fucking make up for lost time, motherfucker.  You know what they do on the Henry Hudson?  Yeah.  Right after, like, it's the West Side Highway, right?  Yeah.  You pass where the George Washington Bridge is.  Oh, yeah.  It's 50 miles an hour.  Mm-hmm.  But that's where all the traffic builds up.  Exactly.  As soon as the traffic breaks up.  Oh, boy. 
[01:39:00]  And it becomes the Henry Hudson.  Yes.  It's 35.  What?  On this highway.  Why would they do that?  Because then you start speeding through, because there's no more traffic, and there are cops always perched right above where the traffic breaks up and the speed limit goes down.  The killing fields.  The killing fields.  Yeah.  Speed trap.  Oh, where is it?  What is this?  Georgia?  Oh, by the way, if Justin is listening.  What do we?  I think you should put in a word that Chip Chipperson should make a guest appearance on the David Letterman program. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, really?  Yes.  Because I think Dave should not be made aware of who Chip is.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  Justin Stangler should be the guy to put in the word.  I think what you should do is you should go to Dave, and you should go, look, Dave, and all the things that...  Trust me.  This guy is the goods.  He should use his entire relationship he's built up with Dave from the time he's done until now.  Put his reputation on the line to vouch for Chip Chipperson.  And his brother.  Oh, and his brother.  Yeah.  I'll just go right out there and go, like, hey, it's me. 
[01:40:00]  What's up, Dave?  Ladies and gentlemen, our next guest, Chip Chipperson.  And would it be a stand-up thing or just straight to the couch?  I don't know.  I'll just tell him when I get there what I feel like doing.  Oh, you wouldn't?  I'll be like, you better have your finger on that button because I might say fuck.  I'm going to open like that.  Really?  Yeah.  I'm going to sit right down next to him.  I'm going to sit down and go, like, what's up, Dave?  He'll go, what are you doing, Chipper?  And I'll go, I hope you got your finger on that button because I might say fuck. 
[01:40:30]  And the audience will go, whoo!  The crowd will go nuts.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We don't know what's going to happen.  This guy's crazy.  What would he interview you about?  Whatever he wanted.  How you doing, Chip?  Fucking good, Dave.  Meet you, Chicks.  Okay, why do you think America would be interested in seeing Chip Chipperson?  Just because they want to laugh and feel good.  There's nothing to talk to you about, no.  Yes, there is.  Just a boring, stupid man.  He'd be like, how's things going? 
[01:41:00]  I'd be like, if it was any better, I'd be embarrassed.  That is pretty funny.  Like an old showbiz answer.  You just try to have one-liners lined up for every question.  How am I doing?  How are you doing?  Now Jay's leaving.  What's up?  What are you going to have, like, this show and a tonight show?  You want to just call it, like, the Dave Letterman Tonight Tomorrow Show or something,  you know, and a place could clap for me.  Do they?  Yeah.  Never clap for that one.  No, no, I don't think they're clapping for that.  I'd say, hey, you're the only guy whose name isn't Jimmy now. 
[01:41:30]  You got Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel.  What's this, like a Jimmy conspiracy or something?  And the crowd goes wild again.  Cheer and clap like motherfuckers.  And you'd make reference to them as being such.  I didn't say that.  I'd be like, yeah, you guys know what's up.  How fast do you go through the easy?  Because I drove with Chip once at the airport.  Ah, yeah.  And he was explaining to me that, you know the spikes that they put so you don't reverse?  Yeah.  I love backing over those things.  Chip, every single time that we passed one of those, which was many times, he would explain 
[01:42:00]  to me that sometimes he likes to bag up over them just to hear the sound.  Fucking tires.  Yeah.  Right over.  So do you go through the easy pass fast then?  Fuck yeah.  Yup, I put the fucking easy pass right up there, I zip right through.  How fast?  Fucking 80.  80?  Yup.  Zoom.  Wow, is that with the gate? 
[01:42:30]  I fuck gates.  Sometimes I just hear a smack and people yelling behind me.  I keep going.  I don't give a fuck.  Tunes are cranking.  I got Loverboy playing.  Loverboy?  I don't give a fuck.  Jesus.  I've driven with Chip before.  He's not a good driver.  No, no.  He drove through Midtown very late at night, swerving in lanes and honking.  I couldn't imagine he'd be very good driving.  No, he's terrible.  Yeah, he tends to be aggressive at the wrong times.  Too slow at other times. 
[01:43:00]  It was late at night, people were sleeping and he'd be driving by apartment buildings and  honking.  That's shockingly loud.  Yeah.  That's right.  I still want to get an answer for this, why you hold up the easy pass to the windshield.  I don't quite get it.  I feel comfortable.  I don't know.  I just feel comfortable.  It's OCD.  It's a weird thing with not damaging the car and control.  It's irrational.  It peels off.  It's like a fucking registration sticker.  I know.  They actually get to tattoo.  Especially since my car's dirty anyway.  Yeah.  But it's all my stuff.  It's not something I stuck somewhere.  You just stick it up there. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  It's like a stick up.  You don't even see it's behind you.  You forget it's there.  Yeah.  You don't even think about it.  I like knowing it's there, though.  I don't want to forget it's there.  Why?  Because what if one day I forgot it's there, and then I realize I forgot it's not there?  What's worse?  I like knowing it's there.  What's worse are the people that put it back into that metallic envelope that it came in?  Okay.  Yeah.  I don't do that.  So that nothing can read it when you're just driving around.  So it doesn't get damaged?  Yeah.  There's some same people that wear tinfoil hats.  They don't want fucking people reading their brainwaves. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  I think that's right.  It's out of the envelope.  But I like knowing that it's there.  Like I like.  But you wouldn't know it's there.  No.  What's on the windshield?  Why wouldn't it be there?  Yeah, but it's there.  I like to reach down and feel it.  Why don't you just put something else there?  No, because I need that like way before I get to the toll.  I'll be like, oh, yeah, the toll's coming up in a couple miles.  So you're rummaging.  I've already got it on my windshield.  Rummaging around.  Reach down.  Weaving, rummaging, and going too slow.  You know what you say?  You say, oh, good thing I have my E-ZPass on my windshield because here comes the toll. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  But then what if I'm like, oh, I thought it was up there, but it's not.  Why would it be?  Maybe I moved it.  I don't know.  For whatever reason.  You can't move it.  For whatever reason.  So walk yourself through this.  Okay.  You realize you don't have your E-ZPass.  Right.  You go through the toll.  Then you call E-ZPass and go, you've got to send me a new one.  Someone's stolen mine.  Mm-hmm.  No, I don't want to have to make a phone call and all that stuff.  I don't like calling.  You'll never find a real reason.  You make a phone call when you need a tire changed.  Exactly.  That's 911, though.  They don't answer to E-ZPass. 
[01:45:00]  They technically don't answer to tire changes.  No, I found that out, though.  You really called 911?  Oh, yeah.  I didn't know who else to call.  I called a whole bunch of people.  The gynecologist.  You should be it, right?  You should have been arrested.  Nobody was helping me because I was on the Major Deegan, and apparently that's a private  road.  So USAA couldn't send anybody.  I called my dad.  I called 3-1-1.  I called.  So I was like, I guess I'll call 911 and let them know.  Oh, you should have been arrested.  Oh, my God.  They said, this is not an emergency, but I do have a flat tire. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, fix it.  And they let me know 911 was really just for emergencies.  They weren't going to help me.  You're like the person that calls because your cheeseburger's cold.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, but I wasn't like rude.  I wasn't like, I have an emergency.  Oh.  I was, you know, saying, look, I know it's not an emergency, but I told them, I don't  know who else to call right now.  Why didn't you just call the local police department?  I didn't know the phone number.  Google it.  Oh, God.  They said that that was not an emergency.  911 was. 
[01:46:00]  How about you Google, how to change a flat tire?  Exactly.  Well, I was in a gas station.  It was the Bronx.  I don't want to get out of the car.  It was like 4.30 in the morning.  Plus.  You're a racist.  I have no idea.  Yeah.  You're a racist.  How to change a tire.  You're a racist.  I didn't even know I had a jack in my car.  And then the guy came, I finally got a tow truck guy there, and he goes, where's your  jack?  And I said, I'm really not sure that I have one.  Oh.  And he looked, and he saw it's a Jeep Wrangler for, you know, because I do so much obvious  off-roading and outdoorsyness. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  And he was like.  No, it's because you like the last part of that, because you're a rump, right?  A long way to go.  Oh, yeah.  And so he just opened up the passenger side door and pulled the seat forward and just pulled  out the jack that comes with every Jeep Wrangler that's right under the seat.  Of course it does.  He said, oh, look at that.  And he, like a man.  Fixed it up.  Fixed your tire and sent you on your way.  Good as new.  With a little pat on the ass.  Good as new.  That's great.  What a fag. 
[01:47:00]  All right.  I ain't got to hit the fucking bathroom.  It's pretty good, yeah.  We'll take a break or something.  How did you want to go to break, Jimmy, earlier?  What was your, what did you say?  Oh, it was holding up the finger.  You say.  Oh, let's, all right.  Simmer down.  What we have here is the best of both worlds. 
[01:47:30]  The fastest reflexes modern technology has to offer, on-board memory, and 30 years of  human experience and interaction.  BoboCop, what are your prime directives?  To serve the public trust, protect the innocent, uphold the law, and to jerk off in a toilet,  all right?  Hard man.  Part robot.  Complete imbecile.  Alive or dead?  Dead or alive, you're?  What am I supposed to say?  Hey, fuck you, you metallic mongoloid. 
[01:48:00]  Eat a bowl of dicks.  Will he be able to recall his past memories?  Don't you remember?  Bobo, it's you.  What's me?  You, Bobo.  It's you.  Who is?  Holy fuck, Bobo.  You.  It's you.  Bobo, it's you.  I think I'm in a weak signal area.  Canine units, please respond.  We have a 16-3 in progress.  All right, let's go, Mr. Maloon again.  BoboCop, who is he? 
[01:48:30]  What is he?  I suck.  The dumbest, most annoying person on the planet is now a law-enforcing cyborg.  BoboCop, BoboCop, any special message for the kids at home?  Believe me, all right, you gotta wear a condom when you go to sleep, because you don't want  to jizz in your pants when you, when you're-  BoboCop?  Sorry, sorry.  I mean, I mean, uh, stay out of trouble.  BoboCop.  And now a reading from the book of Ted. 
[01:49:00]  When the wine was gone, Ted had his disciples fill the drugs with water, and then a miracle  occurred.  And Ted said,  I took water, and I turned it into crystal light.  The wine was now crystal light.  When the food was gone, Ted's disciples gathered, and the Lord Ted proclaimed,  I took a bunch of fishes and turned it into more fishes by cutting them in half.  I had 30 fishes, and I said, I present E with 60 half-fishes. 
[01:49:30]  It was the second miracle Ted had performed, and Ted then divided the fish among them.  I'm working miracles!  The king was not impressed, and ordered Ted to be arrested.  Oh, no!  They misunderstood me!  Ted shouted as he tried to explain himself.  I had an erection!  It was tenting out of my robe, beautifully!  But the guards just ignored him, and Ted was taken away.  The Lord Ted was to be crucified.  Ow!  My hands and feet are hurting!  Ted shouted as the nails were driven into his flesh. 
[01:50:00]  As the crowd looked on, Ted looked to the people and announced,  I have it!  I have it not!  You go and forth!  Whatever that means, this has been a reading from the book of Ted.  Serious Exam.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And, and, and, and.  The B-squared. 
[01:50:30]  Dan, dan.  I used to be a reader.  Aw, yeah.  Funny or die.  He's got a very funny thing on there.  Yeah, Huey Lewis and Weird Al Yankovic.  And they're doing a little parody of the scene from American Psycho where, um, where Paul  Allen gets an axe in the head.  Hey, Paul!  This is such a good song.  Yes, it is! 
[01:51:00]  Yes, it is!  Uh, you gotta love Huey Lewis.  Oh, please.  Do ya?  Hey, look, it's Bigfoot.  Teddy?  No.  There she is.  Oh.  We should bring Todd in.  Yeah.  Todd Rodskine, my pal.  Yes!  Uh, was just, he was in already.  He's a weird little guy.  Yeah, Todd's, uh, got, uh, up in the valley and beyond.  Kenny's distracted.  He's with the morning mashup.  Russ Meyer. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, what happened?  What, what, what happened?  Why can't we have our guest?  Whoever, just open the door and fucking wave him in.  Why can't we get a guest?  There he is.  Christ.  Hey, how you doing?  There you go.  Take a seat right over there.  Sure.  I remember you.  Yeah.  There he is.  Hi, Todd.  Hello.  It's Todd.  You did the Russ Meyer movie.  He's, um, yeah. 
[01:52:00]  He's getting his jacket off.  You got, what, you got notes?  I got a present for you guys.  Oh, what is it?  So the Open Anthony Show, uh, a signed autographed picture of Kit Natividad.  That was, uh.  Oh, that's nice.  Russ's, uh, main lady after, uh, after his divorce from Eve, and, uh, she was in a few of his films.  Wasn't she in Penthouse?  I remember that name when I was a kid.  Kit Natividad.  Who was she?  That's right.  Uh, I think that she, uh, she was in, she was Russ's girlfriend, and she was an actress  in his films, and, uh, she was, I think she did, like, some, you know, strip love stuff. 
[01:52:30]  Let me see this.  Who, uh.  Wow, what heavy tits.  Is she black and white, or is she Latin?  I think she's Latin.  Wow.  She looks, um, as they say, Latina.  Gorgeous.  Can you bring her up, Travis, on the computer?  Kit Natividad.  And if you see her frontal, a frontal view, Russ Meyer would say, like, I mean, her prominent  bush was, like, rivaled only by, like, a blacksmith's apron.  It was just, like, giant.  You gotta see it.  Jimmy, here's that.  Definitely.  Yeah.  Punch that up.  What an ass she had.  So, he liked the big, big, he liked the big hairy pussy, loved them raw, natural, and 
[01:53:00]  like a beast.  And she, like a beast.  She personified that.  And she was just, you gotta see, uh, Beneath the Valley of the Ultra Vixens, because it  really, yeah, take a look at this.  Holy.  Oh, see, no, that picture was, wow.  What the fuck, dude?  The best.  Blow that up.  Wow, she's juicy.  Those are real tits.  Yeah.  I don't mind, uh, like, there's that one girl I've been looking at, the hairy pussy site,  uh, Bianca Stone.  Yeah.  Did she tweet you? 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, yeah, she tweeted me.  She's nice.  Does she follow you now?  No, I don't think so, but she has a big pussy, and I like a big pussy.  But, uh, it's really hairy, which is kind of cool, like, as a novelty for me, but I like  the big pussy more than I like the hair.  Yeah.  That's, like, full lips.  Oh, yeah.  Let me see that pick you blew up there, uh, Travis.  Now, that, is that a big pussy underneath all that?  No, it looks regular.  Kind of plump.  Kind of looks like chimp mouth pussy.  Like, uh...  Chimp mouth. 
[01:54:00]  It does.  It looks like they're fucking just fat lips.  Yeah, like that.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's not messy enough for me.  Not messy enough.  You like a lot of things hanging out.  I like, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Huh.  Kitten Nativa Dad.  Is she alive?  Yeah, she is.  Oh, yeah.  You guys have to autograph a picture.  That was a stupid question.  Hoping maybe you got it on her deathbed.  How old is she?  Uh, right now, she's got to be in her, like, I would say, uh, late fifties? 
[01:54:30]  Sixty-five.  No, she's sixty-five.  I have no clue how old she is.  Sixty-five.  I'm not good with ages, yeah.  Would you still fuck her?  She's definitely doable.  Wow, really?  Absolutely.  She's crazy.  Phenomenal.  Do people like your movie?  I'm getting a good response for it.  Yeah.  I mean, I just got back from Germany, and it played there in this festival called the Regensburg  Short Film Week, and it's in a medieval town.  It's crazy in Regensburg.  I mean, it was crazy to even get to Germany to begin with.  I mean, I had to take a flight to Dusseldorf, then connected to Munich, and then this guy 
[01:55:00]  picked me up there to drive me 90 miles to Regensburg, this small, little, medieval town  that's, like, architecture, you know, a thousand years old and everything, and he's on the Autobahn  going, like, literally 170 miles an hour in, like, rain, and it was, like, no problem.  Holy shit.  Flying.  So it was just insane.  So we're in this little town, and, yeah, and people, it seems like if you're, you know,  old enough to, like, be alive, you know, before World War II, you don't really speak English, 
[01:55:30]  but then after World War II, and, like, you know, you know, later on, they introduce English  as part of the curriculum in school, so a lot of the younger people speak English perfectly.  So, like, but I had, like, some time on my hands when I was, you know, when the film  wasn't showing, and I'd walk around these, like, little cobblestone streets, and I went  into this bookstore where they would sell, like, used books, and I saw this, like, this 80-year-old  guy, and I said, and he spoke no English at all.  I said, do you have any Russ Meyer books? 
[01:56:00]  And then he looked at me, like, you know, curiously, and he said, I don't know, are you  a Jew?  Right, right, and he just signaled someone on the radio.  So I said, do you know, do you have Russ Meyer books?  He spoke no English, but he did say, super vixen?  Oh, he knew.  Crazy.  I was completely, yeah, I was like, what the heck is that?  It was great.  It was Todd.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  World renowned.  Yeah.  It was incredible, yeah.  World renowned, those titties and super vixens.  Exactly, yeah. 
[01:56:30]  It's amazing, like, the demographic, wherever you are on the world, they know Russ Meyer,  and they know about the tits.  It's incredible.  Tits are universal.  Universal.  Fucking Nazis loved tits.  Fucking Stalin.  I'm sure Stalin loved him some big Russian titties.  Big Russian, yeah.  Castro.  Yeah, Castro loves the tits.  There's something about big fucking heavy natural tits.  Big tits.  It's what it, it's just, it's like, but, but, like, you know, so, I, to me personally, 
[01:57:00]  and, you know, as long as there's some type of a well-defined protuberance from either  area, the ass or the tits, I'm fine.  It's got to, you know, define something, something going on, you know.  They definitely, you know, obviously the super vixen is, it's unique, it's interesting,  but they don't have to be, like, huge, and, and, and I'm not, I'm not big on, like, fake  titties, not, unless they're done very well.  Me neither, yeah.  You know, a good natural, uh, even, even if they're smaller, I'd rather have small and 
[01:57:30]  natural than these big fucking fake looking things.  Yeah, no, I totally agree with you.  Yeah.  Which better than something soft to just, like, cuddle up on sucka, you know, it's like  just.  Suckle.  Yeah, just like.  Suckle.  Nestle into it.  It's just like, what are you going to do with these hard, big, you know, knockers?  I sit there, it creeps girls out, but I sit there and, uh, claw at them like a kitten.  I just fucking need, and I don't stop, and I stare them in the face and go.  I hold them both with my hand like a baby, and I suckle with my eyes open wide, and I 
[01:58:00]  kick my little feet back and forth, and I say, I'm feeding.  You're feeding, let me feed.  Yeah.  Big heavy tits.  Yeah, this kitten, let's give it that picture, I can't, she's bent over on a really horrible  black and white, like, striped, almost like, it looks like there's a white W, it looks like  something from the W-O-T-U-P.  Looks like Scorch's set.  Yeah.  The less distracting.  And her big fucking heavy tits are hanging over, and her juicy ass is sticking out, like, 
[01:58:30]  she had a juicy, nice ass.  Right?  She's sexy.  Beautiful.  When did the word juicy get put to an ass?  Because I don't like that term.  It sounds disgusting.  An ass should not be juicy.  Juicy is plump.  Yeah, I like a juicy, oh, you're thinking J-E-W dash.  No, I'm not saying that.  Oh, that's juicy.  No, I'm thinking.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't like, uh, the term juicy.  No, I love juicy.  No, because it sounds like something's leaking out of it. 
[01:59:00]  What do you like?  What do you like?  I just like, uh, pert.  It's nice.  Pert?  Pert.  Perky.  Um, fucking, um, uh, uh, solid.  No.  Um.  A salient?  Yeah, salient.  No, I like a.  It's good.  What, what, what makes you want to cum more?  A juicy, like, juicy, like.  Juicy ass is like you fucking, there's just shit pouring out of it.  No.  But juicy could also, like, imply, like, really ripe.  And just like a.  Yeah.  Plump ripeness to it.  Yeah, that's exactly it.  No, but it makes the assumption that if you, if you open up that ripeness, juice will come 
[01:59:30]  out.  So juicy would be okay, like, if it's about the pussy, but not about the ass.  Exactly.  A juicy pussy's great.  Juicy pussy, right, right.  Juicy ass, not so much.  When you eat a juicy, like, oh, a piece of juicy grape or a juicy fruit or something,  like, oh, like that, those oranges are juicy.  They are leaking juice.  Yes, they are.  But they're plump and filled with juice.  Like, plump and full.  There's got to be something that's plump that isn't juicy.  I reckon. 
[02:00:00]  Fucking E-Rock.  You didn't hear what I said.  Why would he?  Why would he pay attention to, you know, the show?  No, I do love that.  I don't know.  It's a great term.  I don't know.  I just, I'm not a fan of that, I'm not a fan of that term, no.  No.  Juicy.  How about plump?  She's a nice plump ass.  And no, plump sounds dumpy.  I think just fucking, like, there's got to be something for a firm.  She has a hard ass, like a tumor?  No. 
[02:00:30]  Her ass metastasized.  Oh, no.  That's terrible.  I like a plump.  That old George Harrison head ass.  No.  I like something that implies firmness, softness, but firm.  You know, it's there.  It's not sloppy.  Shapely.  Not big.  You know, all those things.  But you've got to wrap it up into a word.  Juicy, ain't it?  Small, tight ass. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah, I like that.  Something that's, like, really just fill out, like, pants in a nice way.  Like, three quarters of a full moon.  Just, like, well-defined ass-molding jeans.  Right, right, right.  Just holds it in tight, you know.  But when you take those jeans off, it kind of just unleashes.  Like two teardrops.  Yeah, it's just something comes out, and it's like, whoa.  So, yeah.  I'm also big on the side view of a shapely girl.  Like the side view, naked, where the back goes in, the ass comes out, and then the thigh 
[02:01:30]  continuing down.  The side view is very downplayed.  A lot of people are like, oh, I want to see the back view, the ass, you know, something  like that.  No, the side view is very sexy.  Side view is what counts.  Exactly right.  It's got that definition of what happens.  Yes.  And when they're just, you know, it's got to come out and jut out like some type of  structurally engineered masterpiece.  You know who has an awful ass that was in a bikini online? 
[02:02:00]  Lindsay Lohan.  Is she good?  What an awful, underslung ass.  It's underslung.  It's underslung.  The arch of her back doesn't even come back out for the ass.  The arch of the back, the lower back.  Like her back, her back, and then it goes in for the arch and never comes back out for  the ass.  It's like, it's convex.  It's underslung.  That's a great way to, no girl wants to think her ass is underslung.  No girl wants underslung ass.  Let me see.  No, that's the back view.  You need the side view. 
[02:02:30]  That looks like a nice plump pussy, too.  You need the side view.  Thanks, Travis.  Yeah, no, you made her ass some dynamite.  You give the back view where you don't really see the underslungness.  Travis.  I like her ass.  All right.  You can't really see much there, but...  Oh, right there.  Right there.  Hold, hold, hold, hold.  No, over one.  There.  There.  Look.  Look, underslung ass.  Come on.  Look at it.  Ew.  Her back goes right into her ass. 
[02:03:00]  Oh, God.  Is that awful.  The angle's not helping either.  Well, you know what?  No, leave it to her.  Look at the fucking...  This is how you know her ass sucks.  Because her leg is straight up, and there's like a little dimple.  Her ass...  The word her ass cheek is...  It looks like a side view of a mouth smiling.  Yes.  Yes.  That ass fucking sucks.  She has a horrible Irish man's ass.  Yeah.  Rick Shapiro calls it Alan Alda ass.  The comedian Rick Shapiro.  Alan Alda.  Yeah, get Alan Alda ass. 
[02:03:30]  Very funny.  See if you can find another side view.  What about that one?  Down, down, over, over, up, up, up, over, over, there.  Look, look, look, look.  Come on.  You're right.  It's horrible.  Oh, my...  Underslung hair.  Look at that fucking dumpy ass.  Yeah, but that could be photoshopped.  I don't know what's going on with that.  Is that real?  That's her horrid ass.  Yeah.  Lindsay Lohan's ass is terrible. 
[02:04:00]  She has the ass of a starving woman.  Like, that's a woman who's dying of starvation where her ass, it just gets baggy and slips.  And underslung awful.  Oh, shit.  I find that enraging when I see an ass that bad.  That makes me...  That upsets me.  Like, that she would leave the house with a fucking dumb ass like that.  Dice used to say that.  What's that?  Dice is a term for an ass.  No.  He would say, the two chunks of flesh where the shit would tumble out.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:04:30]  Two chunks of flesh that shit tumbles out of.  That shit tumbles out of.  Yeah.  Oh, look at that one.  Come on.  Lindsay Lohan's ass is horrible.  Ugh.  And you can tell it's not photoshopped.  It's the same in every shot.  She's got that bad, like Jimmy said, the half smile where the thigh meets the bottom of the cheek.  Her dumb, straight legs.  She has decent tits.  But her body, she has the...  From the side view, she looks like a fucking man with implants. 
[02:05:00]  She looks like a fucking man with implants.  Yes.  She's terrible.  She's not...  She does not have a nice body.  Sloppy, drunk.  I'm so happy.  That's why she's always getting loaded, just to fucking...  To not think about her fucking horrible dumper.  So she knows...  Oh, she just fucking fits perfectly when she sits on a wooden chair.  Yeah.  Fucking like a Lego.  She's got Lego ass.  And then you look at this fucking kitten chick, that fucking plump, juicy ass. 
[02:05:30]  Juicy ass.  Juicy.  Dude, I told you that girl in my gym, it's the nicest ass I've ever seen.  Anywhere.  Really?  Anywhere.  She has one of the nicest bodies.  And what?  Is she wearing like tight clothing also when she's in the gym?  Smooth like yoga pants.  Like, oh dude, her ass is awe-inspiring.  The yoga pant is just an amazing thing now.  I mean, women are just like, yeah, I'm just going to walk around naked, but make it look  like I painted something on me.  Right.  Yeah.  Look at that.  God, come on.  Let me see.  Look at that.  They're virtually see-through. 
[02:06:00]  Um, they hug every curve.  Oh, come on.  That's ridiculous.  We're looking at yoga pants.  Like white yoga pants.  Uh, there's one site.  Oh God, look at that.  Uh, wait, there's one site that is, uh, where they just show asses.  Fuck, man.  Uh, and I know the homepage to this show.  Yeah.  But no, I forget what it is, but it's the same music on every fucking video.  I can't look for camel toe ass, Google that for video, and I'll see if I can find one 
[02:06:30]  of their videos.  Good, good find.  Lindsay Lohan wears yoga pants and there's slack.  There's like fucking hanging material.  She can't even fill out yoga pants.  That horrid ass.  Yes, Jim.  Was it just mean or not funny?  Both.  Oh, wow.  No, it was just not funny.  Anyway, I can't find, I wish I could remember the name of this, uh, shit.  Camel toe ass is not the best keyword search.  Why?  It's funny. 
[02:07:00]  Because it's going to return way too many things.  No, just show me videos.  The video.  I want to try to find, because the music.  Oh, wow.  Jesus.  Jeez.  Not X video.  Wait a minute.  Go to X videos.  Let's see.  No, that's not it.  No.  Yeah, try X videos for a second.  Big ass.  That's probably not it.  Nope, that's not it.  God damn it.  There are so many fucking videos online of fucking sex.  It's great.  It's just an amazing thing now.  You could just, you don't even have to look anymore. 
[02:07:30]  It's not like, you used to have to search out porno.  And to get free porn was like, ah, it's impossible.  You got to join something.  Now, it's just fucking there for everyone to behold.  Unbelievable.  And it's like everywhere.  It could be on any screen, like on a cell phone, wherever you go.  Right, right, right.  Cell phone.  Wherever you go, you have access to porn.  It's my porno.  It's my little porno machine.  Amazing.  My iPhone.  Where did Russ Meyer die?  Uh, 2004.  So he missed most of this.  Like, he got some of it on the internet.  But he saw like, you know, like he saw the advent of like, you know, major pornography happened 
[02:08:00]  all through the 70s and, you know.  I mean, he predated all that.  The internet, uh, he was there in 2004.  He was, he was, he was, but yeah, but he really was, he was old and he, he didn't really partake  in any of that whatsoever.  He used to have to go to the fucking movies.  Yeah.  He used to have to go to the theater and see a Russ Meyer movie.  Yeah.  See some big tits.  But, uh.  Yeah.  They called it, they called it the, the, the, the raincoat brigade.  Any of these people that went to the hardtop and see pornos, they'd all like wear trench 
[02:08:30]  coats.  Just to jerk off.  So they could jerk off.  And he's like, he's like weird, you know, this gummy little theaters like on Times Square  that, that, that they probably don't even exist anymore.  No, not really.  But it gave it such character.  It was great.  It was the best.  They had all these sex foods and everything.  How, how many people could actually be in the theater?  Because it doesn't seem like they were actually a, a full size fucking pantagious.  Yeah, exactly.  And there's always like, only like, like, like, what, like four people in a theater that  can hold like 200 people.  It's like, just like a, you know, smattering. 
[02:09:00]  That's it.  Exactly.  Hardly anybody in there.  Weird.  You know.  Just cranking their dicks watching these fucking videos.  I don't even know.  Do I ever see a porno in a theater?  I have.  A few times.  I saw one in Bayshore, the old Bayshore porno theater, uh, back in the 80s.  Like two people in the audience, right?  Like three people.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's weird.  It's a business.  It's a business.  Businesses, they're, they're already had started, um, uh, video cassettes had already  started coming out with porn, uh, but everyone didn't have a VCR and stuff.  So, and it was kind of a thing you'd do, like all the guys from work would be like, ah, 
[02:09:30]  why don't we just fucking grab some beers or go to Bayshore tonight?  Like, yeah.  And it became like, it was a funny thing.  Cause you'd goof on the movie.  You know, you're not sitting there jacking off.  Right.  Uh, it was kind of just a funny thing to watch.  You know how awful it must've been when you're trying to jack off and you hear these fucking  dummies walking in?  Oh yeah.  All drunk.  Yeah.  Jimmy looks at it from the other side.  I'm trying to jerk off over here.  Yeah.  Come on guys, you're wrecking this.  Keep it down.  You're wrecking the film experience for me.  There's nothing. 
[02:10:00]  That's kind of, uh, that's kind of creepy.  Dr. Steve checking in and saying, I'm with you.  Juicy ass implies ass juice and ass juice implies diarrhea or worse.  Atal leakage.  Thank you.  Dr. Steve spends his time fucking, uh, you know, dumping bedpans.  I mean, you know, it's very ill people.  Yes, that's true.  For him, a juicy ass is a very real, it's a diagnosis.  Yeah.  You've got juicy ass.  Oh, there's fluid leaking from your ass.  You've got a sarcoma. 
[02:10:30]  Flood.  On your ass, fluid.  Yeah.  It's going to be a liver spot, size of a small fist.  Uh, yeah, yeah.  I'm sorry to inform you.  Your mother has juicy ass.  Yeah.  Uh, yeah.  That's the show's doctor.  He's a real creep.  A Dr. Steve.  That doesn't make me think of that.  So what do you do next now?  Does it go, what do you, your film is showing here?  Because I really liked it.  Oh, cool.  I'm glad.  Thanks, Jim.  Thanks a lot.  Yeah.  It's, uh, it's showing at the Friars Club Comedy Film Festival on Saturday.  And if anyone wanted to get tickets, they'd have to, uh, they got to go online to the 
[02:11:00]  Friars Club Comedy Film Festival website.  Is that why they're doing a roast?  They're doing a roast of Jack Black on Friday.  That's right.  Which, of course, I wasn't asked to participate in.  Why?  Why would I be?  But, uh, there's a lot of good people on that day.  It was Amy's on it, and Artie's on it, and Jerry Lewis is there, and...  Jerry Lewis?  I'm debating to go just to meet Jerry Lewis.  Wow.  Yeah, apparently it's part of, like, the festival, so I'm going to be going just to watch it,  and it's, uh, yeah, it should be pretty fun.  You should bring some cufflinks so you could, uh, strike up a conversation with Jerry Lewis. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Pride and joy.  Yeah.  You know how annoyed you would get if you did that?  Like, the line.  Oh, God.  The pride and joy.  I just wanted to show you my pride and joy.  Oh, yeah.  And then it's, uh...  Was that Hennie Youngman or something?  I think he had, like, a card.  That was Rupert Pupkin.  Oh, Rupert Pupkin.  Oh, that king of comedy.  They use that line?  Oh, wow.  Yeah, he was like, my pride and joy?  Yeah.  He's like, that's good.  Keep it, keep it.  You can have it.  It's yours.  Oh, God.  It just got so uncomfortable.  So needy.  Oh.  I love that fucking movie.  It's a fucking...  It's the best capture of a desperate comic mind. 
[02:12:00]  Yes.  Wow.  A brilliant fucking portrayal.  And it's those little weird things.  Like, my favorite scene in the movie is the fantasy where he's getting married on The Tonight Show.  Oh, yes.  Or The Jerry Langford Show.  And the principal comes out, you were right and we were wrong, Rupert.  We were wrong, Rupert.  Yeah.  Just wanting that validation in front of the whole country from your fucking high school.  Yeah.  We're all proud of you.  Oh.  That was such a great summation.  Yeah.  Of what makes people comics.  It was...  You were right and we were wrong. 
[02:12:30]  And we want to apologize to you, Rupert.  It's this moment of collective understanding that you're good.  Yeah.  And everybody wants that moment.  Oh, it's fucking great, man.  So it's only showing on Saturday?  So, yeah.  It's just showing on Saturday at noon.  Where?  It's at the...  It's going to be at the Dolby 88 screening room.  It's...  I believe it's on 6th Avenue here at 55th Street.  Okay.  Right inside there.  And it's part...  Yeah.  They're going to be showing some short films at the... 
[02:13:00]  At that screening room.  Does yours get lumped in with a bunch or do they have to buy tickets just for yours?  It's exactly right.  No, it's lumped in with a bunch of them.  So you buy the one ticket and you can see all the shorts.  And...  How long are the shorts?  They range from, like, I think, 8 minutes to 25 minutes.  How long is yours?  Mine's 15 minutes.  That's a good...  That's a good length for a short, right?  I think so.  Yeah, it's strange.  It's, you know...  And short films, it seems like they're taken a lot more seriously in Europe.  And that's what my experience has been.  And some people make shorts that are 30 minutes.  But, I mean, at that point, maybe just make the feature.  I mean, they make 45-minute films. 
[02:13:30]  I don't understand that.  It's just...  But, like, people have recommended...  You know, they say it's good to get them down to, like, below 15 minutes.  Like, 8 minutes.  Do a little...  Wow, really?  Yeah.  Make them, you know, very concise.  Like the original Sling Blade.  Nice and short.  And then, you know, people go, oh, that's pretty good.  You got more?  Yeah, right, right, right.  Yeah, come on.  Yeah, yeah, that's...  So, it's 15 minutes, and it's doing well.  It's going to be in some other festivals, and...  Are there tits in it?  There's no...  There's nothing...  There's no bare breasts.  Right. 
[02:14:00]  No, can't...  Well, it's about the thing, not...  It's about that, and I wanted to kind of...  Yeah, it was...  No, it was a conscious decision to keep the actual tits out.  It kind of was.  Yeah, definitely so.  Yeah, I couldn't...  I didn't want to do that at this stage of the filming process.  You didn't want to hurt where it could have been shown.  That's a good point.  Yeah, exactly right.  Tits in art, though, is fine.  It sure is.  Yeah, tits in art.  I think so.  Absolutely.  Yeah, it seems like this country, though, is a little bit more conservative with that.  Really?  I think so. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I haven't noticed.  I know.  Wow.  You know, it's like I always say, if there's no tits in a painting, it's just a bunch of colors  on fucking paper.  It's not art.  Paper.  If you don't have fucking tits in your painting, you don't have art.  You're not an artist unless you can paint a tit.  Rockwell?  Nah, he was just doing coloring book nonsense.  I like a nice pair of tits in art.  Yeah, yeah.  A nice fucking...  Who painted a lot of tits?  Van Gogh?  Renoir?  You didn't?  Everything was all like breasts. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah, exactly.  All chicks naked.  Naked and exotic, exactly.  Yes, that's right.  That's an oldie term for fat bitch.  Well, I guess back then it was healthy because that meant that you didn't have rickets or  you weren't going to, you know, you hadn't eaten a fuck, you hadn't eaten anything out  of the sewer.  That's true.  You were healthy.  Skinny broads were probably like, uh-oh, stay away from her.  Yeah, black teeth.  She got bugs.  Yeah.  Scurvy.  Yeah, you watch shows like Game of Thrones, things like that, and they got those pasty 
[02:15:30]  redhead girls, but they don't look very filthy and nasty.  You know, wouldn't they just be hairy everywhere?  Yeah.  Legs and fucking...  There was no shit.  They'd be gorillas.  Well, they do show my pussy hair, but no armpit hair or anything.  I guess they're still trying to make it look sexy.  You know, if they show nudity on Game of Thrones, you don't want to go, ugh.  You want people to go like, oh, shit, they show some fucking tits this week.  Yeah, there's very hot sex in that show.  Yeah, yeah, a lot of it. 
[02:16:00]  Plenty of it.  Like when Joffrey had the fucking chambermaid.  Yeah.  Fucked with those giant dildos.  Joffrey.  He's great.  He's such a fucking dick.  He's my favorite character on TV.  I just want to hug him.  Do you want to hug him?  I do.  I love King Joffrey.  What's wrong with you?  He's just great.  There's no one on TV that gets a better reaction than Joffrey.  By the way, I want to date Khaleesi.  Well, who doesn't?  The blonde dragon?  Yeah.  I've heard she's a fan.  No, you haven't. 
[02:16:30]  I know that.  I heard that in my own apartment.  Oh, okay.  When I said it out loud.  I was rehearsing a conversation with her.  Isn't she scheduled to come in?  What's her name?  No.  Emily something.  It doesn't matter what her name is.  It doesn't matter.  I thought Roland pitched her once.  We were like, yeah, fuck yeah.  No.  Roland will pitch people once in a while.  Kim Jong-un wants to come in.  Did you know there's a book signing?  Kim Jong-un.  Something about nuclear war?  Yeah, he wants to pitch a book.  You take him, you get the president. 
[02:17:00]  They're asking for a favor.  You get Vladimir Putin.  And then we could get Tom Cruise.  That's what I'm talking about, Roland.  All these bizarre combinations.  Yeah.  So is she pitched?  Just because she was pitched doesn't mean that she would come in.  Like, Roland a lot of times asks you guys before anything is even possible to see if he should even pursue that.  What about the midget?  Oh.  Peter Dinklage?  Oh, Peter Dinklage I'd love to talk to. 
[02:17:30]  I hear he's kind of a little prick.  He's probably just tired of asking her in the same way.  Come on, hop up.  He's probably tired of people patting his chair before he sits in his chair.  You don't think he likes the pat on the chair?  No, he pat his chair.  Come on.  Come on.  Putting your hands down to help hold his hands and pull him up on top.  Jump on up.  Come on up, little fella.  You're adorable.  Yeah.  Talk to him like a baby.  Yeah.  So you like to make the TV show?  So.  How do you remember all those lines?  Do they have tutors for you?  Oh.  Are you only allowed to work a certain amount of hours? 
[02:18:00]  You have to be twins, right?  And since the publicist comes in and asks the publicist question, does he like playing on the set?  Do you have little building blocks in your trailer?  Do they give you a half a trailer?  How pissed would he be?  That little goatee is adorable.  Yeah.  Do they stick that on you?  Yeah.  Do they tape that on you?  Oh, God.  He would hate that.  Do you like that?  No.  He would be so upset.  So insulted? 
[02:18:30]  Very.  Hop up.  Here we go, big guy.  Come on.  Yeah, that's pretty well.  Do you have a sippy juice there for me?  An apple sippy juice.  I was about to say, he orders breakfast and we cut it up into little pieces for him.  Cut it into very little pieces.  Yeah.  Do you want panty?  He put like a smiley face with the butter on his pancakes.  Who wants panty cakes?  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  Watch his syrup.  Oh, my God.  Or you tell him, don't smoke.  You want chucky chips?  Don't smoke.  What's that?  Oh.  Oh, shit. 
[02:19:00]  There he is.  He's probably the most successful midget actor ever, right?  That's the opening line when he walks in.  He's not Warwick Davis.  Warwick Davis had a run, dude.  Who's that?  Which one was he?  He was the one who was in Willow.  Oh, that guy.  And I think he got to play a whole ton of shit back in the 80s.  But Peter Dinklage is weird because even though he's a dwarf, he's like, when you watch  him, they'll reference the dwarf sometimes because they would have, but you don't feel  like, oh, here's the dwarf.  No, he's a character. 
[02:19:30]  Just the Lannister guy.  That's something Warwick Davis never transcended with his sight.  I forgot about Warwick.  Warwick was the fucking leprechaun.  Yeah, exactly.  Heedly-doo-dee-doo.  Yeah.  You never want that music playing when you walk in the room.  No, you don't want to be the heedly-doo-dee-doo guy if you're a midget.  There's Mickey from Seinfeld.  Yes, yes.  I want to ask Peter Dinklage, do you hate St. Patrick's Day?  Because you have to agree.  Attell has such a funny joke about how midgets never go to casinos because people would rub them  to death for luck. 
[02:20:00]  Oh, that's fucking great.  He has the greatest midget jokes ever.  If I could only meet one midget, it would definitely be Warwick Davis over Peter Dinklage.  Nah.  But I mean, I don't watch Game of Thrones.  I take Pacino.  Yeah.  Warwick, right?  Yeah, yeah.  He's the fucking man.  I forgot about Warwick.  Oh, stop.  Let me see a picture of Warwick Davis.  He's Willow.  Yeah, exactly.  No, no.  Peter Dinklage, you just see him as a character in the show, not the midget character.  A tiny character.  He did a Life's Too Short, the Ricky Gervais show. 
[02:20:30]  Oh, look at his little tie.  I know.  We think Dinklage would be an adult if he sat down and like, now who did your tie for you?  Let me straighten that.  Yeah, let me, or you just, yeah, his little arms.  He shook his hand like with just your thumb and pointer finger.  I want to pitch that to him as a sketch when I interview you.  You think he'd like that?  What?  I'm rolling and texting, man.  Now we're not going to get Peter Dinklage.  Don't make fun of Peter Dinklage. 
[02:21:00]  Peter Dinklage, don't make fun of him.  They kind of did that bit in Elf.  Yeah, kicked everybody in the head.  He was.  That was Peter Dinklage.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But that's didn't, like, are you an elf?  Does Santa know you're here?  That was funny.  Are you doing an Artie show Friday night, Artie Line?  Yes, I am.  Oh, I'm doing it too.  Cool, man.  Cool.  He did get some, Peter Dinklage did get some grief from his dad in last week's fucking episode. 
[02:21:30]  Oh my God, you called him an ill maid?  Oh, dude.  That was the best lie, you ill maid?  You fucking just lambasted him.  Yeah.  Talk about making someone feel like shit.  Yeah.  Wow.  He gave him a beating.  Oh, verbal fucking thrashing.  You're ill maid.  You almost think he called him pissy eyes and threw spaghetti against the wall.  That hurts too.  Bro, this kid's a midget.  Yeah, he gave him a fucking verbal beating.  Yeah.  That is a well-acted program.  It really is.  Those fucking characters are great. 
[02:22:00]  By the way, our Jamie Lannister has not been in this yet.  That was only the first one.  Wow.  Whose name I don't remember the real guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just call them their character names too.  Why not?  You did the Bob Crane movie.  I forgot about that.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Autofocus.  Autofocus.  How long was that?  That was...  Oh, that was a feature film?  It was with Willem Dafoe and Greg Kinnear.  No, I don't really.  I mean, just met him on the set.  Yeah.  I didn't keep in touch with him.  No.  But yeah, it was an interesting, interesting movie. 
[02:22:30]  He already has a big penis.  Yeah, it's legendary.  Really?  That's what I've heard.  Greg Kinnear was Bob Crane, huh?  Yeah, Greg Kinnear, Bob Crane.  What is he doing?  Because he's a really good actor, Kinnear.  Like, he went on to have a great film career after Talk Soup.  Yeah, he's an excellent actor.  He did a lot of films.  As good as it gets, he was very good at it, right?  Yeah, that was a big movie for him, right?  Yeah, yeah.  He did very good on that.  Was he nominated for that or something?  Yes.  Nicholson and Kubrick.  Did Kubrick Jr. win for that, which he should not have? 
[02:23:00]  As good as it gets.  You know, maybe he did.  Helen Hunt won, Nicholson won, and did they win Best Supporting or no?  I'm not sure.  You know who'd know?  My friend Tori.  That's a good movie.  But what did he do after that?  I feel like he fell off after.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah, he hasn't done much.  Hmm.  My friend who I brought here, Tori Tyson, she's a Google when it comes to anything with the entertainment business.  She knows everything, the history of show business.  Ask her right away, she'll know it.  She should be on Jeopardy.  If you bring her in, she'll answer any question about anything to do with movies from like the 1940s till now. 
[02:23:30]  It's an incredible encyclopedic knowledge.  Actually, she executive produced the short, and she's in the short.  She's an actress and a musician.  Nicholson and Helen Hunt won the Oscar.  Oh, they did win.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  She was great in Twister.  Hey, Anthony, this is Tori.  It's my friend.  She executive produced the film.  Hey, how you doing?  Jimmy, you better than Mike.  Pleasure.  So wait, what was the question about...  I hope I can answer it.  Oh, boy. 
[02:24:00]  Oh, no.  She knows everything.  You're on the spot now.  She knows everything, Jimmy.  Oh, no, Tori.  All right.  Well, we already got the answer.  We were asking you.  What has Greg Kinnear done since...  Okay, he was in that...  What was that film with the Abigail Bruston?  The girl with the fucking little Miss Perfect, Sunshine.  Oh, Little Miss Sunshine.  Yeah, he was a little Miss Sunshine.  Yeah, he was good in that.  And what else did he do?  Even more recently.  The movie was hot.  What was his latest, you know?  Really, I haven't...  Sexy, right?  I can't think of anything recently.  I'm hooked on Dance Moms right now. 
[02:24:30]  It was Little Miss Sunshine, then there was something else.  Oh, okay.  Like the moms?  No.  He played Jack Kennedy.  It's adorable.  Oh, yeah, he did the Kennedys.  That's right, yeah.  Yeah, he did that.  He did the Kennedy.  Oh, yeah?  He played Jack.  Was it Jack?  Yeah.  Jack!  I wouldn't call this an encyclopedic knowledge.  No, I'm serious.  I'm totally serious.  No, no, no.  She knows everything.  If you Google it, she'll confirm it.  She's exaggerating, but I do.  You don't have an internet connection. 
[02:25:00]  I'm totally serious.  Ask her anything about music from the 50s till now, she'll know everything.  Yeah.  It wonders to like...  Who wrote Swanee River?  At Naughton.  See what he does?  No, it's true.  No, I...  Yeah, he's...  I know so.  She's read over 15,000 books on the entertainment industry.  All non-fiction, all about, you know, real people and real events.  Are you an avid reader?  Yes, I am.  I can't get myself to do it anymore. 
[02:25:30]  I get so fucking distracted.  She takes away from my movie and video game.  15,000 books.  I love to read, yeah.  Like, walls are lined with books.  How often do you read?  Every night.  For how long?  Three seconds.  Maybe two, three hours.  Oh, okay.  That's what I do.  Yes.  I read every night, too.  The fucking cable guide.  Yeah.  On the channel.  Okay.  Seinfeld's on again.  That's what everybody's doing.  Exactly.  It's harder to read now.  It's harder to...  We have Paul Anka coming next week, and I want to read... 
[02:26:00]  Oh, his book.  Really?  I can't wait to read his book.  You know about Paul Anka?  She's read every single biography out.  What's to hear about her?  You don't know?  No.  Tell me.  Was she a goer?  He had her.  Oh, he did not.  Yes, he did.  One of the Mouseketeers.  See, there we go.  Yes.  Holy shit.  It's all over the...  He's been wrote in the book.  I did it with Annette Funicholo, so they're all talking about it.  So I wonder if he...  Did he fuck her before the MS got her?  Because right now, she's not good.  Oh, I'm sure he did.  Oh, I'm sure he did.  They asked him to take her to the markets, and he just pulled the van over? 
[02:26:30]  That's his shit.  Oh.  Of course, you never know.  But, yeah.  Who else did he fuck?  That, I don't know.  That's why I want to read the book.  All right.  As well as find out about Frank Sinatra with My Way, you know?  So...  Okay.  He wrote My Way.  I don't know if anybody knows it.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  And the Tonight Show theme.  Mm-hmm.  Da-din-do-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Jeez. 
[02:27:00]  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  They should bring that back for when Fallon comes back to New York for the Tonight Show.  That would be interesting.  Yeah, they'll give The Roots something original.  Yeah.  They don't want to pay residuals to fucking Paul Anka.  Just out of spite.  I get residuals.  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me.  All right.  Well, Chris Jericho is here, so we should...  What?  Take a break, and we have Chris...  I love his turnpike.  I think I've said that once.  Everyone on Long Island right now, cracking up.  Are they?  Cracking up.  Having accidents.  They can't believe they just heard that.  So let's give Todd the proper plug, because I want to make sure people go see this. 
[02:27:30]  Because I really did like it.  I'm not just saying that, because you're my friend.  I genuinely enjoyed this short.  And it's playing at noon Saturday afternoon here in Manhattan.  I thought you were talking about the midget again.  Oh, no, no.  That would be funny if he was in here.  I genuinely enjoyed this short.  I genuinely enjoyed this short.  You try to be saying, like...  You try to be saying in a polite...  I genuinely enjoyed the not-for-length movie.  The movie that's not quite as valued as the other movies.  Right.  Right. 
[02:28:00]  The burden of a movie.  The genetically deformed movie.  The movie the parents are embarrassed of.  Ill-formed.  Ill-formed.  Yes, the movie that ruins the family photos of the other movies.  So what is exactly the name of it?  It's called Up the Valley and Beyond.  Okay, and how do people get tickets for it?  And they'd have to go online at the Friars Club Comedy Film Festival, and you can purchase  tickets for a Saturday show at the Dolby 88 screening room.  It's an interesting movie.  It's 20 minutes long, 15 minutes long, and it's an interesting look at Russ Myers, who 
[02:28:30]  we talk about all the time on this show.  And I loved it.  Cool, man.  So I'm happy for you.  Very cool.  I would like a small part in the feature when you get it.  Absolutely.  I'll be the guy who...  I want to be a guy in the porno theater who just goes, look at those tits!  Wow.  Delivered just like that.  Exactly.  I got my hands out.  Yeah.  Exasperated.  All right, we got Chris Jericho coming up next to promote WrestleMania.  So, simmer down.  So, we're just going to simmer down. 
[02:29:00]  Sirius XM.  It's the OP Retreat Show.  Ooh, we're rocking.  In studio.  In the studio.  In the studio.  Chris Jericho.  Yes!  How you doing, man?  I am actually doing really good, but I'm just going to jump right into it, okay?  I have a bone to pick here with my good friend, Jimmy Norton, sitting beside me eating an apple 
[02:29:30]  with peanut butter on it like a horse.  Well, the ass part, anyway.  And my question is this, Mr. Norton, if that is your real name.  Yes.  Yesterday, I get the reports and the news from my spies that Fandango is in here wearing  his outfit, which is the most ridiculous thing ever.  The son's underpants, I suspect.  It reminds me of when the guys used to do Arsenio Hall in the 90s and they'd wear their wrestling 
[02:30:00]  gear.  Vince made them wear their wrestling gear onto the talk show.  So he comes in here and, you know, it's fine, whatever.  You know, he's saying his name and all that other stuff.  And then you start putting oil on him.  You lotioned him up.  My question is this, Jim.  I've known you for years.  I've done this show many times.  Why have you never once ever put oil on my back?  There's an excellent reason for that.  I would like to know it.  First of all, it was a big surprise that he was coming in.  Sure was.  He handed me lotion and I said, look, this guy appears to be in good shape, but he's  fighting a friend of mine. 
[02:30:30]  So how do I figure out if he's really in good shape?  I lotioned him up and then I could tell you, I think the lower back, there's a little bit  of weakness in there.  That's what I was doing.  Yeah, I was absolutely trying to get a little bit of information from my friend.  Imagine my dismay when I see this.  Look at this.  It's like watching your girlfriend kiss another guy.  Say, Jimmy, my buddy, Jimmy.  What's he doing?  Oh, no, Jim, you're not going to put oil on that.  No!  No!  My favorite is a lame attempt to reach for his arm when he moves away. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah, go to the beginning, Travis.  I missed his arm at one point.  Look at the very beginning.  Watch it.  Look at the very beginning.  No, no, the very beginning.  Oh, that is the beginning, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Watch it.  He moves away.  He looked like a blind man reaching for the light switch.  Oh, how embarrassing.  So, anyways, look at Sam just smiling away.  Oh, my gosh.  So, that was an interesting visit there from Fandango. 
[02:31:30]  Fandango.  Now, of course, you're up against Fandango.  I am.  I am up against him at WrestleMania on Sunday.  I would assume he's going to ask you to say his name.  Oh, we've been doing this for the last couple weeks.  Yeah.  I mean, this is a new guy that he's never had a match yet in the WWE.  Oh, no.  So, his first match is against Y2J at WrestleMania in front of 80,000 people and millions watching at home.  So, just a little bit of pressure on the guy.  But, yeah, you know, that's how it works. 
[02:32:00]  You've got to try and get new guys into the system.  After, you know, after all these years, you try and see who, you know, throw everybody against the wall and see who sticks, so to speak.  So, this is his big shot.  Let's see if he can do it.  And if he does good, I mean, it's just kind of a feather in my cap because it was kind of the mission.  Should I choose to accept it from Vince McMahon?  I have this new kid that I want you to work with, Chris.  And it's like, okay, so here we go.  You know what I find very interesting?  When you were the fucking Mule Juice McQueen, you wouldn't break fucking character. 
[02:32:30]  And now, you won't go into character with this match.  Well, he's a good kid, new guy on the fucking match.  Yeah, he does it.  He's got some heat, so I'm going to put him over.  I always do the opposite, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, that was 13 years ago, man.  Can you believe it?  13 fucking years ago.  You guys were over in, like, a broom closet over on 54th and 30th over there.  That's my first time on the show.  Yeah.  Was when Chris was in with, uh...  That was your first time?  With Dice.  With Dice.  Yup.  And Frantic Fran. 
[02:33:00]  Oh, right, right.  She was playing the piano or some shit.  I don't know what she was doing.  There was an old guy with her, and I was there for three breaks, and I had a shit gig.  It was canceled.  I'm on the radio in New York.  Why would I do this $75 gig?  What's wrong with me?  Exactly.  And I stayed on.  I should have taken the gig.  I know.  I really should have.  Believe me, if I would have known it was going to spiral down this far.  Fast forward, I'm 44.  You're 44 putting oil on a half-naked man.  Exactly.  A guy who's never wrestled before, and I can't give him up.  I missed your arms, hero.  Like a little fruit that I am.  That's great. 
[02:33:30]  But that's a lot of pressure for that guy.  So I said to Chris before, that's a tremendous opening gig, man.  And that's a guy who's a completely seasoned fucking veteran.  Very comfortable in the ring, yeah.  Yeah, and you know, like we were just saying, it'd be like if you were in a band and your  first gig was Madison Square Garden, sold-out show, you know, opening for Metallica or something.  But yeah, but that's how it is.  You know, you train all these years to get into the system, and the guy's been in the  system for years, maybe eight years, ten years.  And then you wait for your shot.  I hope I get my shot.  Sometimes it's a smaller shot. 
[02:34:00]  Sometimes it's a bigger shot.  Sometimes it's the first match you've ever had at WrestleMania.  Now, we heard yesterday that this was Vince's brainchild, this whole Fondango thing.  Was there a surprise that it picked up any heat at all?  Well, I mean, because on the outside, the idea sounds ridiculous.  It does.  In its practical application, it works.  Well, yeah, and the thing is, too, when Vince is into something, you know he's going  to give it as much chances as you can. 
[02:34:30]  Sure.  So he's got an elaborate stage set.  He's got a lot of TV time.  And, you know, not to, you know, stroke my own penis, but it's like, you know, I've  done a lot of work.  Jim, I'll do it for you.  Get him some lotion.  You still have some of that oil?  Yeah.  Actually, get the peanut butter, man.  There we go.  But, you know, it's a lot of kind of my efforts as well of knowing kind of how to do things  and how to put things together to get people interested in this character.  And, you know, like I said, that's kind of my job.  That's what I have to do.  Right, right.  Yeah.  You're doing well. 
[02:35:00]  On the surface, it does look pretty ridiculous.  There's no doubt about it.  It's like, it was one of those things where the more it happened, like each time it just  got funnier and funnier and more ridiculous.  Yeah.  And the crowd finally understood what they were supposed to do with it.  Like, all right, we're supposed to hate this fucking guy that doesn't wrestle because  we can't say his name.  What a ludicrous fucking...  No, yeah, exactly.  But, I mean, that's wrestling, right?  Yeah, yeah.  It's like if you want to make it, anything in show business, you got to do something 
[02:35:30]  that's different and against the grain.  And guys like, I mean, if I was in the crowd, I'd be just like you guys.  Yeah, yeah.  This guy is so...  Yeah, like what an asshole, right?  It was funny to watch him, though, as everybody said his name.  Everyone tried it.  Like, you'd be into fun, and already shaking his head no, you lost it already.  It was a very funny...  Don't even try.  Well, it's great, too, because whenever you hear Fandango, I always think of Bohemian  Rhapsody.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, right?  And that's what I actually did.  Can you do the Fandango?  That's what I did when they wanted me to say his name. 
[02:36:00]  I do like this litany of mispronunciations, Fandango, Fandingbat, Fandunghole, Fand...  I see a little silhouette of a man's got a moose, got a moose, can you do the Fandango?  And he's kind of looking at me, so...  You just refuse to play with it.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, and then I said, you know, I need some new movie tickets as well, so...  That's good.  Well, I mean, you're going to be in the ring with him.  Do you think you guys are going to get a match off?  Yeah, at this point in time, I could probably have a match with Sam, you know, so it's just... 
[02:36:30]  Please don't.  Throw him through the window.  Yeah.  Fuck.  I'll be paralyzed.  Yeah, please.  It's just a matter of just figuring out what he's best at and what he...  I mean, like I said, I've never even seen any of his matches, so...  Oh, you haven't?  No.  I mean, I don't even know if he has...  I mean, he has some, I'm sure, but where, I don't know.  So, it's a matter of just trying to figure it out and break the key, break the lock.  I can't imagine that at WrestleMania, you'll just continue to do the, you don't say his 
[02:37:00]  name properly and he leaves.  Like, I...  Yeah, there will be a match.  There will be a match.  There will be a match.  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, and look at it from my end, too.  It's like I've main evented WrestleMania.  You know, I've had, I've had like the best matches at WrestleMania in the past, and then  here I am, you know, when I was first told what my task was going to be, it wasn't exactly  the most, I wasn't exactly the most excited about it, shall I say.  Yeah, yeah, if you're going to just be standing in the ring at WrestleMania and then have to  leave...  Yeah, no, that's not going to happen.  So, I mean, we'll figure something out.  It'll be fun. 
[02:37:30]  Who have you main evented against?  I main evented against Triple H back at WrestleMania 18.  We were on, we were on last.  And then the match I had against Shawn Michaels at 19 was like, you know, the best match on  the show or whatever, not to sound egotistical, but the thing about WrestleMania is it's the  biggest show of the year, right?  It's the Super Bowl of what we do.  So, everybody wants to steal the show that night.  And, you know, some matches are designed to do that and other ones are not. 
[02:38:00]  You know, this year, Jericho Fandango is probably not designed to steal the show, whereas Brock  and Cena or Triple H and Brock Lesnar are the ones that people are expecting.  So, you go out there, it's like anything, it's like being on a good team, like a good football  team or a good hockey team.  It's your job to do your part so the team wins.  Right.  Sometimes you're, you know, you're the quarterback and you're throwing, you're playing every  time.  Sometimes, yeah.  Sometimes, yeah.  Sometimes you're the wedge buster that gets one play a game.  But if you don't do good, the team loses. 
[02:38:30]  So, I always equate it to that and try to explain that to some of the younger guys.  Wait, Triple H is wrestling or no?  Yeah, he is.  He's wrestling Brock Lesnar.  What a fucking, holy shit.  Yeah.  I was excited to see you.  I'm excited to see CM Punk.  Yeah, Punk versus Undertaker.  Yeah, because I know you guys and I like you guys.  But, I mean, The Rock, I'm sure it'll be fun to watch because he's a legend.  Yeah, yeah.  But I don't care as much about that match as I do yours and CM Punk.  Well, because you know us.  You know, that's always better when you know somebody.  Of course.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, once you get to meet somebody and know them, you automatically get into it. 
[02:39:00]  Now, of course, the Punk match, I mean, taking a little bit of real life tragedy and mixing it in with...  I mean, thankfully, Paul Bearer had the decency to pass away, you know, a couple weeks before WrestleMania.  What a guy.  You know, had he not, who knows what they would have done.  Right, what storyline they would have gone with.  But dumping his ashes out of the urn onto Undertaker was very, very...  With fake Paul Bearer in the background. 
[02:39:30]  Right, right, right, right, right.  He did a great job.  He looked like Tony Orlando.  Tie a yellow ribbon around the yellow tree.  Yeah, if you saw Raw last week and saw Paul Heyman dressed as Paul Bearer, he definitely had a Tony Orlando and Don type of vibe to him.  Yeah, the mustache was a little different.  The big mustache, yeah, yeah.  But yeah, so I mean, it's going to be a good show, as it always is.  But it's fun to come to New York.  I went to the Ranger game last night, which is the first time I've been to a Ranger game since 1974. 
[02:40:00]  Wow.  When I watched my dad play.  And just to be there, yeah, it was really cool.  Like, the only times I've ever been on the other side of the coin at the Garden was last night.  And then I saw Metallica there in 2010, I think it was.  But other than that, like, it's cool to actually be there in the audience watching.  Watching something huge, yeah.  Yeah, and then just the buzz about WrestleMania, and I mean, you go down, you know, driving down Times Square, there's banners and, you know, the big Trons.  I mean, it's definitely, this is like the WWE's backyard, the New York area. 
[02:40:30]  So to have WrestleMania here is just so much more amplified and so much more, you know, where is WrestleMania?  It's at MetLife.  Giant Stadium.  Oh, it is.  I thought it's all okay.  And then you say in the Garden, I'm like, wait, is it there?  I thought it was at MetLife.  Yeah, the Garden on Saturday is where they're going to have the Hall of Fame, which is huge, too.  That's Bruno Sammartino, McFoley, Bob Backlund.  So some legendary guys.  It's Jim's favorite.  Oh, yeah.  Who's who?  Bob Backlund.  Bob Backlund.  Yeah, I just, I can't stop talking about Bob Backlund.  And his knee walk.  Yeah, and his knee walk and his polite, you know, I just want to wrestle Vincent. 
[02:41:00]  I was in Japan with him in 94.  He came on a couple tours.  And if somebody wants his autograph, he demands that you name the presidents in chronological order.  If you can do that, he will give you his autograph.  That was the phase he was going through back then.  And my friend, his name was also Anthony, wanted me to get him to sign his pro wrestling.  I was on tour with the guy.  I had to fucking go to the library and look up the presidents and go say, he's like, well, if you want me to sign your autograph, you have to name the presidents. 
[02:41:30]  In chronological order.  I'm like, are you serious?  He's like, yes, I am.  What a dick.  Yeah, totally.  Wearing a three-piece suit in like 100 degree weather at all times.  Sure.  Came on the bus one day with his tie a little bit loose and went to the boss, Tenryu, who's the Japanese guy.  I said, I'm sorry, Mr. Tenryu, my tie is loosened.  I apologize for this.  And it's like, we're wearing shorts and muscle shirts.  I apologize.  That's really him, huh?  Yeah, very, very quirky man, shall we say. 
[02:42:00]  How long was he champion for?  Like four or five years.  Yeah, it was a while, right?  Bruno was champion for like 19 years or something like that.  That's how it was back in those days, you know?  I remember when Andre finally lost, that was such a giant thing.  Who did he fucking lose to?  Was it Hulk Hogan?  He lost to Ted DiBiase with the double referee twin switch.  Which was awesome.  Wow.  Yeah.  Oh, damn.  Iraq's a big fan of Ted DiBiase.  Has a belt that's autographed. 
[02:42:30]  The million dollar belt is autographed.  But you know what happened?  It was tragic.  Tragic.  He got it signed by Ted DiBiase.  And that's all Iraq wanted.  Right.  The million dollar belt signed by Ted DiBiase.  A hand emerges out of nowhere of brown color.  Virgil grabs it, grabs the sharpie, and signs it also, thus ruining the belt for Iraq, who  only wanted.  And there's the picture.  Look how dejected Iraq looks. 
[02:43:00]  And Virgil's grabbing the belt.  Well, there's a great story, too.  Like, if you go to, like, a Walmart, like, anywhere, you'll see Virgil with a picnic table  set up in front of the Walmart with a big sign on the back that says, Million Dollar  Man, Ted DiBiase, plus Virgil.  Plus Virgil.  But there is no Million Dollar Man.  It's just Virgil there.  It's just Virgil.  Yeah, exactly.  Well, our own Sam Roberts has made LonelyVirgil.net.  Wow.  And this is pictures of Virgil talking his wares at every location possible.  Is that a subway? 
[02:43:30]  Yes.  That's here.  That's in Grand Central.  He was in Grand Central Station.  This is what happens when you don't save your money.  You think that's it?  Yeah.  Poor investments?  Yeah.  Poor investments.  Yeah.  No investments.  Was he ever really popular?  Not really.  I mean, he was kind of an 88, you know, popular to an extent.  He was like, you know, it was kind of, I'd say, kind of a little bit of some racial overtones  that this really rich white guy had the black guy doing all of his dirty work.  Right.  Yeah, kind of a sad state of affairs. 
[02:44:00]  That's why you always want to try and do other projects and kind of branch out while  you can, which is exactly what I do as much as I possibly can, because I never want to  end up at the Walmart looking like this with these signs.  And by the way, an empty table in every picture.  In every picture?  Yeah.  Oh, there's a person.  There's one person.  No, that's somebody in front of Virgil.  Yeah, you got to look at that.  But Virgil's in the background just trying to squeeze his way into that one.  Poor man.  I wonder if he got up after that picture was taken and tried to get money from her because 
[02:44:30]  he was in the picture.  Technically.  Probably.  Yeah, good point.  Exactly.  Listen, technically, you know, the rules say I am in the shot.  Exactly.  Yeah.  And you know it's a sad state of affairs because that's Savio Vega that's getting somebody  with a picture.  Yeah.  And Virgil's lonely.  Lonely, lonely Virgil.  LonelyVirgil.net.  Yeah.  How's Brock doing?  He's back in the mix.  Oh, thank you.  Back in the mix.  A little grub for you.  He's doing good, I guess.  You know, he's kind of a loner type of a guy, but he does big business when he comes 
[02:45:00]  back, so it's good to have him.  You know what I mean?  It's good to have him there for sure.  I haven't heard my...  I think this is the first time hearing that he's wrestling.  I've only heard about you and obviously the wrong...  Yeah, he'll wrestle, I think, like maybe 20 or 30 dates a year or appearances a  year, so it's a pretty good deal.  Is it crazy when The Rock shows up now?  Because he's fucking...  He's a movie star now.  I mean, that's...  There's no real denying it.  Yeah, I mean, it's always good to have a guy when he comes back.  I mean, like you said, he's one of the biggest stars that there is, and he kind of stayed 
[02:45:30]  away from wrestling for a long time, and now when he comes back, it's a big deal.  But that's kind of the way that the business has progressed.  Like for myself, I come and go pretty much in between Fozzy tours.  Right, right.  You know, in between filming, you know, with Robot Combat League.  Robot Combat League.  That's the one.  I was calling it Robot Wars.  A lot of people call it Robot Wars.  I don't know.  Robot Wars just kind of rolls off the tongue, but it's Robot Combat League, which has been  going great.  I mean, we filmed that back in October, and you know, sometimes things come across your 
[02:46:00]  desk that are good, some come across your desk that are bad, and some come across the  desk like there's this giant robot fighting show that wants you to host it.  And you're like, what?  Like, huh?  Like, what is this all about?  So I was thinking, like, what kind of robots could they be?  Like, is this Rock'em Sock'em?  Is this, like, going to be, like, Claymation or something?  So I go there, and the first day, they go into this arena where the robots fight, and  I'm standing there, and the robot comes walking out, and if it hadn't have stopped in front  of me, I would have turned and ran away.  Yeah.  Because it's eight feet tall. 
[02:46:30]  It moves fast.  It moves quick.  It looked like a Terminator.  They look badass.  It's crazy.  The amount of technology that these actually exist blew my mind.  And then I was like, well, what kind of fights will they be?  Like, are they just kind of like, ding, ding, ding?  Yeah.  But these things are beating the shit out of each other.  I mean, there's, like, fire and smoke and sparks and hydraulic fluid shooting all over  the place.  There's eviscerations, amputations, decapitations, every type of ations you could have with these  robots fighting.  It's like the opening scene from Saving Private Ryan, but with humans instead, with robots 
[02:47:00]  instead of humans.  So it was really, like, we've never seen anything like this before, and to be a part of it just  blew my mind how cool it was.  I didn't know what to make of it at first.  I'm like, is this real?  Right, exactly.  I'm like, wait, wait, wait, is this real?  It's like the movie Real Steel, if you've ever seen it, but without Hollywood magic.  I mean, these robots are actually fighting each other.  And you could sell tickets to these fights.  I mean, it's all real.  Like, the fights are actually happening as they happen. 
[02:47:30]  There's no speeding up or slowing down or anything like that.  It just takes a while in between rounds to repair the robots.  I would assume, yeah.  You know, yeah, it's like a two-person team.  There's, like, a jock that kind of does the fight, and they put an exoskeleton on when  they punch the robot punches, when they duck the robot ducks.  Yeah, yeah.  Then there's the tech that controls the robot's movements and then has to fix the robots and  repair them in between rounds.  Some people would call them nerds.  I just call them really fucking smart people.  You know, so it was, like I said, it was super, like, uncharted waters. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah.  Because we'd never seen this before.  We didn't know what to expect.  Didn't know how the robots were going to react.  It was, like, the longest shoot ever.  It was, like, so long.  That's what I was watching, thinking, this had to take forever to tape one show.  It took, like, almost a month to get the nine shows down, because when the robots got smashed,  it was, like, putting two Lamborghinis in a demolition dude.  Yeah, you can't just put them back in there.  Yeah.  And when they break, it's not just, oh, some duct tape. 
[02:48:30]  Let me see, Travis.  Yeah, it's, like, you have to, you have to, uh...  Wow.  Yeah, I mean, it's, like I said, it's, like, watching, you know, Terminators.  And, actually, they have 2,000 pounds per square inch punching power.  So, if that hits you in the head, it would kill you.  So, we've now created robots that can kill human beings.  Nice.  And in 15 years, when they take over the planet, you know, you're going to see, you saw it here on Sci-Fi First.  It'll be like that fucking Jericho.  Exactly.  Wait until they look just like people.  Like, wait until they get that technology down.  Well, yeah.  And, like, robots rights and all that stuff. 
[02:49:00]  I'm telling you, that will happen.  You're going to be, people are going to mistreat their robots, and people are going to be upset about it.  You know, it's funny, the first day, like, George Lucas' daughter is an MMA fighter.  Yeah.  And she was one of the contestants on this show.  Is she really?  And, yeah, and the first day I show up on set, George Lucas is there.  So, you walk in, it's like, okay, this is the director.  It's like, okay, fine, great to meet you guys.  But is that George Lucas over there?  Yeah, what the fuck?  It's like, yeah.  So, I go to talk to George, and I just was asking him, how is this for you to see, like, all of these ideas that you had, like, when you were a kid? 
[02:49:30]  And now it's basically coming true.  And he said, if you look at all of the Sci-Fi movies from the 50s and 60s, all of that technology is coming true.  Like, you know, communicators talking from the planet to the sky.  Well, there's your cell phone.  Looking at a monitor and seeing somebody and talking.  There's Skype.  Robots that can think.  Like, I'll ask Surrey right now or the nearest Burger King agents, you'll tell me.  And now robots that fight each other and can kill you.  Combine all this technology, and pretty soon Skynet will exist.  Skynet.  I mean, it's coming true, right?  Yeah, yeah.  It really is a little frightening. 
[02:50:00]  Do you remember how crazy it was to think of a Skype conversation, like a phone that you could see each other?  Like, that was 10 years ago.  Exactly.  Like, what?  And so 10 years from now, these robots are going to look like our old cell phones from 10 years ago.  But right now, I mean, like I said, these could actually kill you.  And I think all of us have a little bit of a curiosity or a fascination about robots as a whole.  So, yeah.  This show premiered.  It was like the number one highest rated debut show in sci-fi history.  Yeah.  Beat out Sharktopus and Piranaconda, I guess. 
[02:50:30]  Sharktopus.  Sharktopus, Piranaconda.  But, yeah, so it's been going really good.  The season finale is not this Tuesday, but next Tuesday.  And we're down to, like, the final three robots.  And as you can see, all of them have their own gimmicks.  So it's Crash, which is this steampunk.  And then Scorpio, which has these blades on its hands that actually cut robots in two.  Cutting the middle part, which is causing all of this damage, which the robots just collapse into two pieces.  Yeah, I saw when they were assigning robots to the people.  So I'm kind of thinking, like, oh, that guy's got to be bummed. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah, right, right, right.  And then there's another one.  It's just giant fucking hammer fist.  You're like, nah, yeah, yeah.  He's going to get his ass handed to him.  They all have their pros and cons.  And then it was really cool last week that you could choose a weapon.  So they had all these different weapons, like maces and, like, spinning saws.  And you could put that onto your hand.  That's pretty good.  Yeah, it's just a really cool idea that I did not expect to be this cool.  And now that I did it, it was just amazing to be a part of it and be involved in it.  So, you know, to do a show like this was cool because it's not too far away from what we do in the WWE. 
[02:51:30]  It's show business, right?  You know, just selling it to the crowd and making sure that people have a good time.  Man, yeah, once these things become, like, you need robot rights, I'm sure they're going to say it's a mechanical life formant.  No, they'll say mechanical life formant.  And it'll be the R word.  Robot will turn into the R word.  Don't say robot.  Robot, yeah.  Look at that fucking robot, can't drive.  You're acting like a robot.  Oh, come on.  You're acting like a robo.  Yeah. 
[02:52:00]  Look at the robos.  You can't say that word.  Robots can call each other robos.  Right, right.  But you can't call a robot a robo.  Right, exactly.  You can't do it.  Robosexual.  I think some chicks will want to bang the robots.  Right.  Oh, God.  Disgusting.  A robo lover.  A robot lover.  Yeah.  A robo lover.  A robo hoe.  Oh, look at the fluid pumping out of that poor guy.  Wow.  What movie are you watching?  Jesus, is that Norton putting oil on Fandango?  Look at the fluid pumping out of that poor guy. 
[02:52:30]  How happy are you for the new fucking Sabbath?  I can't fucking wait.  Amazing.  So excited about it.  And to see the videos that they're showing.  And I love the fact they have Brad Wilk on drums.  I think that's...  I mean, obviously we want Bill Ward.  Yeah.  But I love the fact they got rid of Ozzy's guy.  Okay, I like Tommy Lai, but I didn't know him in the studio.  I like him, but it's Sabbath, man.  They need...  And Brad Wilk is such a machine, and he's one of Ruben's guys.  Right.  You know, Ruben has his little stable...  Like, Chad Smith plays drums on most of Ruben's stuff. 
[02:53:00]  Like, all the Dixie Chicks and Kid Rock and all that sort of thing.  It's always Chad Smith that plays drums on the Peppers.  Yeah.  Wow.  So this time, he originally wanted to get Ginger Baker.  Holy shit.  Yeah, and Tony was like, you know, fuck off.  There's no way you're getting Ginger Baker.  And he's like, okay, what about Brad Wilk?  So, yeah, I'm super excited, man.  You know, like, especially after those two songs that they put out in 98, which were not good.  I like them, but maybe I'm just very biased.  I enjoy them.  Yeah, it's like, I like St. Anger, too, because I'm so biased for Metallica, right?  But I'm just super stoked about it. 
[02:53:30]  And, like, Ozzy, I just want to hear him sing in those high-ass ranges that, you know,  just hitting those notes that he barely ever hits anymore.  Hopefully I got him stoked, you know?  Well, why don't we, can we take a break so Chris can eat?  I mean, Jesus.  Oh, man, yeah, I'm fine.  No, we'll take a break and...  No, just do a single.  Yeah, just do a single, and then we'll be right back.  Amy will be here with Chris.  Yeah, cool.  Excellent.  Perfect.  We'll be right back after this.  Sirius XM.  This is the OPN3 Show.  Hey, everybody. 
[02:54:00]  We're here with, of course, Chris Jericho.  I'm joined now by the lovely Amy Schumer.  Surprise!  Amy!  He's talking to the microphone.  It's been a while.  Hi.  What a nice surprise.  I know.  Thank you for letting me join you today, you guys.  Please.  Please, we need a little beauty in this place.  Just say it, pussy.  Go see it up. 
[02:54:30]  I mean, of course, Chris is a lovely gentleman over here.  He is.  Very handsome man.  I hate that Chris is better pussy than me.  More than you know.  It really hurts.  But I was saying, Amy looks more famous now.  Is it because it looks like I'm on drugs?  Different aura.  I look like I go speak at schools about the dangers of meth.  No, it's because your jacket is zippered up and you look tight.  Like, your hair is pulled back.  Yes, yes.  That's not true.  Now I know you're lying. 
[02:55:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I did my best.  I slapped it all together today for you guys to come in here.  It's great.  Mission accompli.  You look good.  I was, um...  You guys look like you.  Oh, yeah.  You guys look like you got a burl.  You guys look...  You guys are here.  Ran out of the house without doing anything.  Yeah, you guys look good.  You look like you got a prostitute of questionable gender last night.  Ah, Norton.  Always with the tranny jokes.  Yes.  Slash confessions.  Slash complete reality. 
[02:55:30]  I saw, like, like...  I saw Amy in such a different light when I...  I was doing a thing for your TV show.  Yeah.  For the show, Inside Amy Schumer.  It's going to be on Comedy Central.  When is it premiere?  You're so funny on it.  April 30th.  April 30th.  Definitely looking forward to that.  But what I saw was, like, I've known you casually coming in here.  I've seen you on stage.  For years.  Very funny for years and stuff.  And then I see this professional woman taking charge of her show.  I was like, ew. 
[02:56:00]  Did it make you sick?  Like, how did you feel?  I felt...  I instantly became intimidated by you.  That's awesome.  And, like, going, like, oh, my God.  She's fucking, like...  She can definitely handle a situation.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Did it kind of gross you out in me as a woman?  Were you just, like...  I never thought of you as a woman.  But, no.  It was...  No.  There was something very sexy about it.  I'll give you that.  Nice.  But it was definitely a little intimidating.  I was like, ooh, this is Amy.  Ooh, look.  She's, like, responsible. 
[02:56:30]  She's all growns up.  Yeah.  I just wanted you to be running around and have people go, Amy, come on now.  It's like dick jokes, yeah.  Get back here and you're supposed to be here.  Right, right, right.  Irresponsible, Amy.  Amy's in the dressing room coloring.  I couldn't...  Outside the lines.  Yes.  We start, Amy.  But she's going around.  It makes me feel any better.  A lot of times I drink at work.  I drank.  I drank on set a lot.  Oh, that's cool.  I'd be like, what time can we start drinking today?  Thanks for sharing.  Yeah, well...  Damn it.  I could have used a filter, too.  Yeah, exactly. 
[02:57:00]  There's a set somewhere where it's five o'clock.  Isn't it dark?  But Amy was going in, like, around where everybody was in hair and makeup, and Amy would come in  and go, yeah, I like that.  No, take that off.  Put that on.  I'm like, fuck.  She's running this show.  Yeah.  To the detail.  Yes.  She's the boss.  Cool, definitely.  I'm the boss applesauce.  Definitely.  I love the scene that we shot.  You played just the worst, cheesiest game show host of all time.  Yeah, yeah.  It was definitely ridiculous and embarrassing.  Let me ask us, who is the worst, cheesiest game show host of all time?  Wink Martindale? 
[02:57:30]  Wink Martindale's got...  Name alone.  Just the fact his name is Wink.  Name alone sticks.  Wait, did he kill himself?  I don't think so.  Oh, okay.  That was Ray Combs from Time of Feud.  Ray Combs did, right?  What about the guy before Ray Combs that kissed everybody?  Richard Dawson.  Oh, he was pretty bad.  Died naturally.  Oh, naturally.  He kissed everybody.  Yeah, yeah.  He just went in for the kiss.  He was bad.  You just knew you had to kiss him.  Yeah, like, here it comes.  Here it comes.  But I think just the fact the guy walked through life with the name Wink, like, what an asshole.  Wink Martindale.  What a fucking asshole.  And you know it came from him just going, I gotcha. 
[02:58:00]  Hey, yeah.  His real name was like Eugene Martindale or something.  He thinks it was endearing, but fucking the people that made up the name are like, yeah,  that fucking asshole winks at everybody.  He's a wink.  Hey, hey, wink.  Wink Martindale.  Nobody likes a winker.  You're never on the receiving end of a wink and you're happy about it.  Oh, Jimmy, stop.  You never want a stinky wink.  Stinky wink.  What's a stinky wink?  I don't know.  I got that from a Stephen King book.  He was talking about, like, this murdering clown who dropped a, no, the picture, the  fucking photo on the wall dropped a stinky wink.  And I'm like, ooh, that's a good one.  Was that It? 
[02:58:30]  Yeah, good fucking call.  We got it at the same time.  We got it at the same time.  Boom.  How great was that?  Bad movies.  Fucked me.  I hated the movie.  Yeah, it was pretty creepy.  There's rarely been good Stephen King movies.  No.  If they're good when he has nothing to do with them.  Yeah.  It's odd, except for writing the book.  Yeah.  And then when they give it off to someone else, a good screenwriter.  And director.  Then it's good.  When it's like, you know, maximum overdrive.  And Stephen decides he wants to direct.  Good subject, though.  Those are hard.  Oh, yeah.  ACDC.  ACDC did the whole thing.  Yeah, that was pretty good. 
[02:59:00]  I remember the clown is holding a fucking balloon in one leg, one hand, and a severed child's  leg in the other, and he's doing a shucking jive, and he says, I've come to rob all the  women, rape all the men, and learn to do the peppermint twist.  And I'm like, what a great, yeah.  That's my favorite.  What a great line.  Yeah.  The peppermint twist with a fucking, and the wind was blowing, but there was no wind.  And it was, oh, just, Stephen King's a fucking genius.  Yeah, yeah.  I, uh, we had a show in Banger, Maine last year, and I googled his address and went to  his house. 
[02:59:30]  Hit him with your van?  I sat outside of his house, and I was going to go, and it's very creepy.  And I was going to go knock on his door, but then I found out that he lives in Sarasota  most of the year.  Oh.  But I was just going to go walk up to his door and knock, and like, what the hell?  What's the worst thing?  He has a Rottweiler that comes and attacks me.  Hey, it's Chris Jericho.  That's what I was hoping, like, on the outside chance that maybe he watches wrestling or VH1  or, you know, Robot Combat League or something.  Something.  But he wasn't home, that bastard.  So I just went and broke in his house.  That is it.  Oh, God.  Hit under his bed for a few hours.  Took a shit in his toilet. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah, and left it.  I didn't even flush.  Yes.  Fuck you, King.  He's wrecking everything.  He's wrecking everything.  How big is his house?  It's not like a mansion.  It goes back, but it's like in a suburban area, like house, house, giant haunted house  with a big gate with a bat on it.  House, house, house.  Oh, okay.  So, yeah, it's big, and it's dark, and it looks like something he would live in.  Yeah.  But it's just kind of spoiled by the fact that there's all these other nice little houses surrounding 
[03:00:30]  like, you want it to be like in an open area with like, you know, an acre of haunted graveyard  around it or something.  You do not want to be Stephen King's neighbor.  You don't.  It's like, just maybe the burbs.  I don't know.  He could have good Halloween parties, though, maybe.  I bet he does, yeah.  Right?  He's probably like the most sticking up the ass guy.  Doesn't do anything.  Hates everybody.  Hates his damn kids.  Trick or treat.  Get out of here with his damn kids.  He looks like he fucks kids.  Like, he just has that face and those glasses.  Like, you know when you see a picture of Tom Lester, it's never a guy you're like, that  guy?  It's never like a hot, athletic. 
[03:01:00]  I don't know what you said with his damn list.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Buck teeth.  Seven feet tall.  It is creepy, because I've had people that talk about coming by my house, driving by  my house, and there was somebody tweeted.  Yeah, I've had somebody trying to find my house and tweet about it, and tweeted, like,  his location and where he was, and he was real fucking close.  The next day, I'm driving to work, and I hear about a SWAT team, got this guy, and it 
[03:01:30]  was a standoff, and it was the guy.  No way.  At his fucking house, having a standoff with SWAT.  It was an airsoft gun he had, but still, it's a gun.  He was doing that.  And he had your address in his pocket.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's really horrifying.  So, like, two days ago, maybe three days ago, some guy posts on Twitter, yeah, just driving  around looking for Anthony's house, so I want to stop in for a beer.  So I put up my computer, I put up a map of Long Island, where I live, but, like, a full 
[03:02:00]  map of Long Island, so it wasn't detailed.  And I pointed at the area on the map where I live.  I go, I'm in this general area.  I was pointing with my Glock.  I was like, here.  That's right there.  You found it.  Ding, ding, ding.  And I took a picture and posted it.  That's great.  That's the welcome you're going to fucking get if you're going to come on over.  I'll give you a beer and a couple caps of yes.  He wanted to just hang out.  Like, the guy who got in a standoff, that's the people that want to spend time with me.  There was another guy a few years ago that, I mean, I'm hanging out with my friends, 
[03:02:30]  and I got a knock on the door, and it's some guy who goes, Anthony.  I'm like, yeah?  Yeah, I'm just a fan of the show.  I kind of figured out where you live, and I just want to, you know, can I just have a  beer?  And I was like, all right, you know, come around back.  And Danny was there, I guess, and shit.  We were just hanging out.  And I figured it would be better for me to sit down and talk to this guy, find out his  name, what he does, where he lives, than to send him away. 
[03:03:00]  Now he knows where I live, and he's pissed.  Right.  So it turned out he was just some fucking goofy fan with a family in Kings Park and shit  like that.  So, but I was like, dude, you can't do this.  There's a great video online of a fan that goes up to Angus Young's door.  Oh, shit.  In, like, Glasgow or wherever Angus lives.  You can look it up.  That's cool.  He knocks on the door, and Angus opens the door.  He's got, like, a cup of coffee and, like, pajamas on.  And he talks to him for, like, 15 minutes.  You know how Angus is.  He's just hair all over the place.  Just obviously woke up. 
[03:03:30]  And probably doing the same thing that you did.  Just like, who the fuck is this guy?  Who the fuck are you, man?  And who's this guy with a camera?  I better talk to him before he blows my house up.  That's what it is.  Wait, now it sounded like Chris Hansen came by.  Like, wow, this makes a little different than him.  I see you brought some Zima in condoms.  Yeah.  Fucking Zima, the cure-all for underage sex.  Uh, it was for me.  Yeah.  It really is a strange thing, though.  I mean, I don't know why people feel compelled to show up.  That would really freak me out.  Because you put it out there. 
[03:04:00]  Anthony brings it on himself.  Because you put it out, like, these open parties.  And, like, you let the fans in.  I have had a few.  Yeah, you've made it an open house.  But they're invited.  Like, I've become friends with some fans of the show.  Right.  And they come to parties at my house.  I guess other people assume that, you know.  Come one, come all.  It's just if you show up, that's kind of, you know, what happens.  They assume correctly, as your story just told me.  Yeah, he's like, so I lied, man.  He spent the night on the radio.  Was that on the radio?  Don't go to Anthony's house. 
[03:04:30]  Don't.  Hung out.  Also, in places outside New York, I feel like it's more typical, like, to just, if you're having a party, like, people can kind of just come in and out.  Yeah.  I've had neighbors show up at parties at my house.  Yeah, and you're like, uh, this is not.  Yeah, just like, hi.  We're not in Sarasota.  Yeah.  I live, yeah, I'm in the back over here.  It's like, oh, yeah, have a beer.  Yeah, go back to where you live.  Yeah, have a beer and leave.  The cops call, um, the cops are called once by this fucking bitch that lives kind of diagonally from me. 
[03:05:00]  And I, I kind of do play the music a little loud, and I have parties.  I'm embarrassed to be at your house at two in the morning.  It's a fucking Monday.  How loud do you think this is acceptable?  I, I, you know, sometimes.  You crank it up.  I've had, I've been in a lot of bands in my life.  A little tinnitus, maybe.  Sure.  I cranked her, man.  I cranked that shit up.  The jacuzzi bubbles are going loud.  It's hard to hear everything.  So, uh, yeah, it gets up a little loud.  And, um, I was on vacation, and, uh, uh, there were, there were a couple of girls, like, Ray Lynn from Canada was over and shit. 
[03:05:30]  And she's topless in the fucking tub.  And it was great.  We were, Ray Lynn from Canada.  People are smoking pot and shit.  She's tits.  It was fucking fantastic.  And, um, and the cops show up at the back gate.  And, uh, they walk in.  And, and they're like, uh, Anthony, it's Wednesday.  What are you doing?  I'm like, ah, you're having so much fun.  And the fucking joints are being thrown and shit.  I'm like, Ray Lynn, put your top on.  No, you leave the girls topless. 
[03:06:00]  Take it off.  Right.  That's smart.  And they told me, they pointed to who was complaining, and they go, you know, we wanted  to give you the benefit of the doubt, but we were driving on the next block, and we heard  the music, so you gotta turn that shit down.  I'm like, ah, it's cool.  You wanna hang out?  You wanna beer?  No.  We'll be leaving now.  Yeah, yeah.  But then you went and shit-bombed the neighbors that told on you.  Exactly.  Fucking rat.  Yeah, exactly.  Rats.  Yeah, I like when cops have clear boundaries.  Like, you know, sometimes they're two, just like one of the guys, and you're like, wait, 
[03:06:30]  aren't you supposed to be, like, protecting their lives?  Even at the airport, like, a couple TSA people last week were like, can we have a picture?  And I was like, are you allowed?  Like, aren't you supposed to be making sure nobody's bringing guns on the plane?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Aren't you busy?  You're at work.  It's great, too, when you get pulled over.  Like, you know, we do a lot of driving in between shows.  Yeah.  And if you're speeding or whatever, and you get pulled over by the cops, and every time  I always try and do the same thing, like, where are you heading to, sir?  Oh, we just had a show in Dayton.  Oh, yeah.  Heading to another show. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah.  In Cincinnati.  Another show.  Oh, what kind of a show do you have?  And it's like, well, it's WWE, you know, wrestling.  And either of the guys go, oh, really?  Oh, what's your name?  And Chris Jericho, hey!  Or they'll be like, okay, well, you know, good for you.  Glad you had a show.  Yeah, yeah.  Let me see your driver's license and registration.  Yeah, yeah.  But you've got to try, right?  You've at least got to try.  You do try.  I slip in a PBA card.  I got a PBA card, which is Policeman's Benevolent Association.  And it's by Keith, Keith the Cop.  And I usually hand it.  And they always ask, like, who gave you this?  Because they don't want you just handing them some random cards. 
[03:07:30]  Maybe some asshole.  And I go, yeah, I go, Keith, he's the lieutenant with the NYPD.  You know, he's my security guy.  And then they're like, security, what are you doing?  I'm on the air, radio.  You're on a show.  Radio show.  Yeah, you always say show.  Makes it sound so important.  Yeah.  I actually have a mic in my hand when they answer.  I'm like, so.  One of those old Gene Rayburn super skinny mics.  Oh, my God.  Oh, shit.  That is, though.  You've got to kind of.  I know, though, a lot of times if I, you know, whoop, whoop. 
[03:08:00]  And I'll be like, all right, I'll pull over.  And you see that door open.  You're like, come on, come on.  And I see some fat, like, black woman get out.  I'm like, I'm fucked.  You're fucked.  She is so out of the demo.  Yeah, absolutely.  Try to drop Kevin Hart's name.  Kevin Hart.  Yeah, out of the demo.  I see some fucking guy that, you know, he didn't join the force to change things.  Yeah.  He's like, yeah, you know, it's good.  It was sort of all that was left for him.  Trying to get his quota of ticket tickets for that month. 
[03:08:30]  Running out the door, tucking in his uniform kind of a guy.  Coffee spilt on his tongue.  Oh, jeez.  I'm in.  Oh, come on.  This is one of mine.  You got, you know, you got to try.  Well, yeah.  But see, the thing is, when you're a girl, you can just squish, try and squish your boobs  together a bit.  Does that work?  That's true.  No, I don't think my tits have ever worked for me.  In any case.  Maybe it's commenting on the quality.  Yeah.  No, I wish.  I would totally do that.  Have you gotten out of things by being cutesy or something?  Smile a little.  But just like. 
[03:09:00]  The stinky wink.  Such a gamble.  Who's getting out of the car?  It's such a gamble.  And if, and if you like kind of name drive yourself or you try to use your, your feminine  wares, they like, if you get nagged, it's so much more humiliating.  Right.  You, you are really a prostitute.  You'd rather just get the ticket.  Yeah.  Totally.  Just give it to me.  Oh my God.  I've, I've, oh, the worst I ever did was, cause you know, my, my dad's cousin is the  senator of New York.  Yeah.  But really, I'm like no relation to him.  But, but a couple of times I've been like, look, I am closely related to the, to the senator. 
[03:09:30]  And people are just like, get the fuck out of here.  You don't care.  It's a whole new kind of humiliation.  I was talking with Slash about this and when both of us have, have made, we both said to each  other and we've never said the, the dreaded, do you know who I am?  Because I, I would never use that cause I'd be so petrified that, you know, no, who are  you?  And then you're done.  Yeah.  You know?  And so like, he, he's never said that either.  And it's like, you can't ever.  Who doesn't know who he is?  I know, but if you ever say that, that pushes you, you are now the ultimate asshole. 
[03:10:00]  But no, I've said that the other way.  Like if a girl's willing to fuck me, I'm like, do you know who I am?  What's wrong with you?  Don't you realize what you're getting into right now?  Oh, what an error you just made.  Slash could just fucking like roll the window down and just start playing that riff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just play a fucking riff.  That gets them out of any jail or any ticket.  I know who you are.  I don't even have to look.  I wrote this.  Yeah.  Oh my God.  You may be familiar with this little ditty. 
[03:10:30]  How about this one?  Do you know that song?  That's mine.  Do you know how fast you were going?  No, I was listening to me on the radio.  On multiple stations.  I'm pretty law abiding now compared to the old days.  I used to, I used to literally drink and drive.  Like I had a beer.  Like while you were driving.  While I was driving.  I had a work van.  I worked for the wonderful Apollo air conditioner.  Wow.  And it was a work van.  And it said Apollo air conditioning on the side. 
[03:11:00]  And there was a sign on the back that said, if you, this driver's driving unsafely, call  this number and have the number.  And then it had big four digit and one letter number that you were supposed to report.  And I changed it with electrical tape.  Because it was black and it was like, so you know, you turn the fucking three into an  eight and shit like that.  Some innocent driver's like career got totally fucked.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because I just drove like an asshole and I would have a beer like, cause it was a work  van.  There's so much shit like tools and equipment and stuff that you could always just take 
[03:11:30]  the beer and pop it in a piece of duct work or something.  So the cop, if he came to the window, wouldn't see it.  But like, what am I just going to be like, hi, but constantly had a beer right there between  my legs.  Just fucking drive.  Look, you do the old look around first.  Lift, right.  Drink it.  Oh my God.  Just, and it was, it was no problem.  I mean, did it make you, did it give you some adrenaline to?  No, it was probably pre-gaming for where I was going.  No, it kept him from shaking apart. 
[03:12:00]  That was called maintenance.  Like, I think the van's wheel is shimmying.  Oh wait, no, that's my arm on the steering wheel.  It's my nervous system letting go.  Yeah, I would really, I never even think twice about it.  I've been so fucking lucky with that.  Cause I, I mean, when I got, I got a DUI in Los Angeles and you remember Hill Street  Blues.  Yeah.  I spent the night in Hill Street.  It's like a real, it's the worst cop station you could ever go to. 
[03:12:30]  And when I got put into the holding cell, it was me and like six or seven Vatos.  I'm talking white beers.  I'm talking the, the, the, the teardrop under their eye.  And I was like, Hey man, are you Chris Jericho?  I'm like, Oh my gosh.  Do you want me to be?  Yeah, exactly.  And I'm like, you know, if they say, Hey, let's see if you can really fight.  Can you really fight Chris Jericho?  And I was like, okay, this is bad.  Like I can maybe take one of these guys, maybe two if I go crazy, but I'm going to  get killed.  And so then like the holding cell was open. 
[03:13:00]  So I kind of walk out of the holding cell.  Like, sir, get back into the holding cell.  I'm like, I can't go back in there.  So I go to the front.  Did he say that to you?  Can you really fight?  He did.  Why'd that guy talk like that?  So then they tell me, uh, you got to get back in the stomach.  Listen, um, I kind of have some notoriety and these guys know who I am and I'm scared.  It's like, Oh, what do you think?  Who are you?  I'm a Chris Jericho wrestler.  I go back in the cell.  When I went back in the cell, then they call me Chris Jericho, come out of the cell.  They had looked me up online and matched my picture to me. 
[03:13:30]  So they took me out of the holding cell and put me in my own little cell, which is about  the size of like a toilet.  And I just had to sit in there for like 12 hours, but it was the worst.  I mean, there's, it's a whole long, big story, but it was the worst thing ever.  And when the cop told me, when you get finally like busted for DUI, most people drive drunk  80 times before they actually get popped.  So you might not even think you're drunk.  You might've had a beer.  Right.  That could be over the limit.  80 times before you get busted.  So, wow.  So you could have another 30 or 40. 
[03:14:00]  So drive drunk, people.  If you're new at it, keep it up.  You've got plenty of time.  It was 2006, 2007.  So were they really menacing you or just kind of being silly when they said that?  Like, but they really meant it?  It was like three in the morning, uh, downtown LA, man.  I don't know if they meant it or not, or they were just messing around or they're just  screwing around.  But the point was, it was not a good scene.  The point was they weren't white.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There you go.  That's the point.  That could work for you or against you, like being famous for being, being an athlete.  Like they can either go, oh fuck man, this guy's great.  Or let's see if he can really.  It could have been one of those ones where, you know, an hour later I'm sitting in the 
[03:14:30]  middle and they're all gathered around me and I'm telling stories and they're laughing.  Or I'm in the middle and they're all gangbanging me.  One of the two.  This, uh, I was watching a clip last night on those amazing police fucking videos and  it was inside a holding cell and, uh, this guy's on the phone and he's trying to tell  one of his buddies, uh, where he is.  And another guy's just laying on the floor on his coat or something.  And, uh, the guy on the phone goes, yeah, I'm at the county jail.  And then the guy on the floor just goes, he goes, no bro, this is the city jail. 
[03:15:00]  The guy on the phone just puts the phone down.  He goes, what motherfucker?  And starts beating the shit out of the guy.  Just beating the shit out of him.  For nothing.  It's like, why, first of all, why would you open your mouth?  Yeah.  But that's what I mean.  Like they put me in this little cell and there's, it was like a, there's a window that you can  see through and there's people like in orange jumpsuits cleaning the floor.  I'm like, what if this is me?  Like, what if I never get out of here?  And I'm looking across the way and there's another door with a, with a window and there's  a guy in the window and he's staring at me and I look over a couple of times. 
[03:15:30]  And the one time I look over, he mouths to me, I'm going to fucking kill you.  Really?  And I'm like, oh my gosh.  So I'm standing there like really freaking out.  And then, uh, they announced my name.  Would Chris Irvin please make himself known?  So how do you do that?  It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a cell and the window is like, you know, six inches.  I'm banging on the window.  Like every other guy in the place.  Cop opens the door.  He's like, what?  I'm like, uh, they, they just told me to let you know that I'm here.  Uh, and he's like, good for you.  You're here.  Close the door.  Yeah.  This ass.  And then I'm fucking, I look up again and the guy mouths, I'm going to fucking kill you 
[03:16:00]  at me again.  I'm like, no, I'm going to fucking kill you first.  And then he disappeared.  So it was like, you just get so like crazy.  You should have turned it on.  Well, let me tell you something.  That's what I said.  I'm coming for you.  That's what I said.  He goes, when he mouthed it the second time, that's when I said to him, no, you're, I'm  going to fucking kill you first.  Cause I'm getting fucking freaked out.  Right?  Worst thing ever.  I don't know if you guys have been to jail.  I don't know how anybody could be in jail for any time.  Like 14 hours.  I said, 27 hours.  I spent 20, 27 hours here in New York. 
[03:16:30]  DUI or what?  No, it was an Opie and Anthony show.  What?  It was a bunch in a very brief nutshell, like 2000, there was a bunch of naked girls on  a bus and they were not part of the show.  They just stopped in to promote this thing called the Voyeur Bus.  And Louis Black and I, this is before I was a daily regular, we're in.  And they said, why don't you guys go on the bus with some of the Opie and Anthony producers  and stuff.  And drive around Manhattan.  And call in and give updates.  By the way, the bus had glass sides on it.  So there's naked women.  So you could see in it.  Yeah.  Just driving around Manhattan looking. 
[03:17:00]  Not a wizard, but I believe you could see through glass, you guys.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So we get stopped on 6th Avenue.  CNN jumped on the bus and apparently Giuliani was annoyed.  We got too close to Clinton's parade route like the next day.  His motorcade route.  Yeah, great day.  His motorcade route.  So we get pulled over.  There's all these fucking lieutenants and Catholics, all white shirt cops.  And they took us to the tombs.  And it was a Thursday.  It was Thursday at like 530.  I had a gig, of course, that I didn't make.  And they couldn't think of what to charge us with.  So Friday at like 730 p.m., 27 hours later, me and Louis were smokers at the time. 
[03:17:30]  So I'm fucking pulled.  At the time.  I was craving a cigarette so desperately and I had to shit, but it was filthy.  And luckily, they knew that the inmates, there was like nine of us that went in, kind of heard of what we were there for.  So they thought it was kind of cool.  Like, you got a bus full of naked girl?  Like, they were more interested in hearing why we were there than beating the shit out of us.  Yeah, motherfuckers, that's what we're in for.  But in that one, they're all going to see the judge. 
[03:18:00]  So it was almost like people don't really want to fight right there.  Right.  They just want to get out.  They want to get the fuck out.  But had that been a Friday, I would have spent the weekend.  Dude, 27 hours.  It must have been going nuts.  I don't even want to cheat on my taxes.  It fucking freaked me out so badly.  That's all it took.  If you don't take that as a warning.  Oh, it sucked.  You know, on top of that, when I got charged, it's called a wet...  Talk slower.  Wet dry.  Wet reckless is what it's called.  It's not a DUI.  It's a step under.  But if you get a second DUI, it counts as two. 
[03:18:30]  Okay.  And then I had to go to eight AA meetings.  Jesus.  And then plus like a $10,000 fine.  It was brutal.  But I went to the AA meetings and the first couple times, like, they open the meeting.  One guy will talk for a bit and then they take a break right off the bat.  You can get your little card signed and then split after like 20 minutes.  So the first two or three times I did that.  Then the fourth time, I had to stay to, I don't know, read something or whatever.  And then I heard these stories of these people that had everything, then got in a DUI, killed somebody. 
[03:19:00]  Wow.  One crime ever was, like, hitting somebody, T-boning them, and then losing everything.  Fuck.  And it was like, after those eight meetings, I was like, you know, I am never, ever, ever, ever driving drunk again.  I don't care if I have one drink.  I will never do it again.  If you don't learn your lesson after getting one and spending time in jail, you are a fucking idiot.  You know what the fucked up thing is?  Sometimes you just can't afford to not drive.  Well, I know.  It doesn't make sense.  But, I mean, I thank God now I have the means to call the car service, leave my car somewhere, and fucking then pick it up the next day. 
[03:19:30]  Right.  Like, I will not, and believe me, I spent a lot of my time drinking.  Yes.  And a lot of your time driving.  Yeah.  But I will not fucking drive drunk anymore.  No way.  There are people that wake up in jail and have no memory of what they did.  Oh, boy.  Like, they drunk drove and they killed somebody.  Yeah.  Can you imagine?  That's the worst.  Imagine that.  It's like, I didn't even know.  It's so not dramatic.  It's not like a going out.  It's just like you fucking run over somebody in a crosswalk.  What was I?  Imagine that feeling.  It's the worst.  What, did a cop catch me pissing or something? 
[03:20:00]  What did I do?  Oh, yeah, you killed somebody, a whole family, holy shit.  And it's never like a toothless crackhead you kill.  It's always like the guy that was on the road to cure cancer.  Wonderful.  It's always like the perfect father.  A wonderful person.  Ten-year-old kid or something.  Yeah.  It's never just terrible.  Oh, my God.  If you get one thing from today's show, ladies and gentlemen, honestly, don't drink and drive.  It's not a cliche.  Don't do it.  That's why in New York it's so much easier.  That's great.  I don't drive anywhere.  But when I go to L.A., I'm like, what do you guys do?  You just stop drinking?  They're like, yeah, we just stop drinking.  And then you have to call for a cab? 
[03:20:30]  Why are you alive?  Yeah, you got to call.  You can't even hail a cab.  Why are you alive?  What do you do out here?  What are your plans for life?  All right.  By the way, E-Rock just told us in our earphones that Chris has to go.  So I don't know if you have people outside pulling you.  E-Rock?  He's got another show he's doing here.  Oh, okay.  He's doing the wrestling show.  Oh, okay.  I got a couple shows.  That's a weird fit.  I'm making the rounds today.  That's a strange show.  Anybody call for me, E-Rock?  Oh, Amy.  But Chris is promoting WrestleMania this Sunday.  Of course, Sunday.  I'm really looking forward to going to my first one. 
[03:21:00]  Which is going to be great.  And then Robot Combat League, which is Tuesdays at 10 and Fridays at 10.  They replay it after SmackDown.  And that's getting ready for the season finale in a week and a half.  Yeah.  So, yeah.  It's been a good day.  It's always fun to come see us.  A lot of fun, man.  Chris, thanks so much.  Sam is always, you got to shut the fuck up, man.  I know.  I get a little yappy sometimes.  Sam.  Is this your playlist, Jimmy, for this week?  I'm making a few changes, though.  Okay.  See, Jimmy and I both have radio shows, too.  Jim's is really good.  I listen to it all the time.  On the Boneyard. 
[03:21:30]  Yes.  Where you fit again.  Kajagoogoo's too shy.  I hope we're going to close with that every week.  Boston more than a filling.  It's the dentist version.  Look at Leonard Skinner.  Leonard Skinland.  S-K-N-L-A-N-D.  Simple man.  Skin Leonard.  And he misspelled simpleton.  Because that's what he is.  Oh, my God.  No, there you go.  Yeah.  Good show.  My show's on Sixth Sense.  Saturdays at 5.  I'm Mickey's channel.  Yes.  Indeed you do.  Very cool.  Thanks, guys.  Amy, what do you guys got a lot of stuff? 
[03:22:00]  Nothing.  I just...  What?  I'm here.  I'm going to be here again.  I bet.  Is that some one?  Yeah.  Well, just my TV show.  TV show.  April 30th, yeah.  And I'm on the road a bunch, if you go to my...  Is it a special?  Is it like a skit?  No.  It's a series.  TV show.  Nice.  Series.  And it's funny.  It's like I read some of the...  It's fucking really, really funny.  Jimmy is hilarious.  We had one scene.  Me and Bobby Kelly were in it.  And Bobby saw it.  I can't watch myself, but he said he loved it.  Oh, my God.  You have to watch it.  And there are all the outtakes.  We laughed harder that day.  Oh, my God.  You just kept blowing it. 
[03:22:30]  These two creepies.  That's what kind of just come upon me.  Wait, that sounds horrible.  Yeah, exactly.  Kind of a show is this.  We have to stick to Cinemax.  It's odd, yeah.  We come into view.  We come into frame around Amy's face, me and Bobby.  Just like a pier.  We kept laughing.  And I also kept being afraid that I was going to ruin this show.  It was her pilot show.  It hasn't aired yet.  We only had, like, two usable takes.  So we're laughing so much.  You know how this biz works.  Still have a chance, Jimmy.  Hi, see?  Yeah, we get it, Anthony.  No, I mean, come on.  It was good.  And I'm at Caroline's April 11 through 14. 
[03:23:00]  And tonight, I'm hosting that live show on AXS TV at the Gotham Comedy Club.  Oh, nice.  I think it's 8 o'clock on AXS.  I'm not sure.  I think it's later than that.  Is it later?  I think so.  Maybe.  Everyone's so busy.  Maybe you should be Jimmy's publicist.  Amy knows more about your schedule than you do.  It's 10 o'clock tonight?  Yeah.  Oh, I should have learned that before.  Oh, nerds.  Your call time's probably, like, now.  You know, they get so scared.  They leave camera blocking.  Are you staying for the after show with Sam Roberts?  No, she's not.  She's welcome.  I don't know, I want to get breakfast. 
[03:23:30]  Can you guys get breakfast?  Can any listeners stay for the after show with Sam Roberts?  I'll meet you at Anthony's house.  Oh, hello.  Sometimes Anthony listens, but beyond that.  I listen on the way home just to...  I need something more annoying than the traffic.  Just to distract you from all the people that are moving.  Why are you so quiet when Chris is here?  Sam's all rosy-cheeked and embarrassed.  Oh, I know.  He's been like that every time.  He's a semi.  He's wearing his denim-on-denim outfit.  Nice.  I didn't want to take anything away from you guys. 
[03:24:00]  Come on, Springsteen shirt.  Why don't you talk to him?  I have watched Sam grow from a young lad.  Yeah.  How old are you now?  I'm 29.  So I met you when you were, like, 17.  I don't know.  18.  Yeah.  You know, I met you the first time at an autograph signing, and I was, like, 15.  Okay, so there you go.  I remember.  You had the exact same hair.  Yeah.  I took you up for ice cream after, I recall.  Yeah, which was really, really nice.  It was an ice cream, sir.  He was worth something when he was adorable.  Yeah.  You know, now he's got whiskers.  Yeah.  Time has been unkind to you.  Sam's creepy. 
[03:24:30]  What's the matter, Iraq?  What, Iraq?  Chris has to go.  Oh, geez.  All right.  Why don't you start booting our guests?  All right.  We're just getting somewhere.  I know.  We just opened the door here.  It's an honor.  Thank you so much for popping in.  We want to see more of you.  I like when you're on the show.  You're a lot of fun.  Thank you.  Very good.  Sam Roberts, stay tuned for the Sam Roberts show.  Please.  And I'm telling you to stay tuned for your own show.  For God's sakes, please.  Anyone.  Anyone's out there.  Iraq, thanks for whatever you do.  Exactly.  And, of course, Jimmy Norton.  And we'll be back tomorrow.  I hope he's going to be in tomorrow.  Yeah, he should be. 
[03:25:00]  There you go.  We'll see how the doctor's visit goes.  Here he goes.  Why?  What was it, Jim?  Just something to do with, it was something like Xbox thing where his asshole had burst outward.  But he got it.  But he just got it.  Yeah, but he just got it on the couch.  I don't know how he did it.  He was just sitting on the couch.  He was playing jacks and he sat on one.  All right, well, we hope that gets better by tomorrow.  And we'll be coming soon.  All right, take it easy.  Thanks, guys.  Bye, bye, bye, bye.  Drink it up, get up.  Drink it up, my friend. 
[03:25:30]  Drink up, drink up, drink up the Obama calling.  I'm in chains.  I'm in chains.  I'm in chains.  My freedom of speech is in chains.  I'm the one in chains now.  I'm in chains.  Because I can't say what I want to say.  Let me know.  How long do we pay?  Wouldn't you rather have a guy holding a gun on you? 
[03:26:00]  Or a guy that's about to hold a gun on you?  Let me know.  Because we're having a gun held on us right now.  Right now.  Right now.  We're having a gun held on us right now.  Stop it.  Once you vote white, you know you vote right.  Right.  Why?  What?  Can I wear one of those out and not be beaten to a pole?  It's time for Whitey to realize we don't have to be victims anymore.  I'm in chains.  I'm in chains. 
[03:26:30]  My freedom of speech is in chains.  I'm the one in chains now.  I'm in chains.  Because I can't say what I want to say.  Let me know.  How long do we pay?  I hope the Kool-Aid's cold.  I hope it's icy cold.  Drink it up, my friend.  Drink up the Obama Kool-Aid.  How long do we pay? 
[03:27:00]  How long do we pay?  Before people fucking act like human fucking beings.  I'm in chains.  I'm in chains.  My freedom of speech is in chains.  I'm the one in chains now.  I'm in chains.  Because I can't say what I want to say.  Let me know.  How long do we pay?  I'm fucking exhausted. 
[03:27:30]  I'm going to need a nap.  Serious XM.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After Opie and Anthony live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Here he is.  How come you're holding the door open, Roland?  He's just standing there holding the door open while he bends over to pick things up.  It's After Opie and Anthony live.  Big, big show again today.  WrestleMania week continues, I suppose. 
[03:28:00]  I'm damned if I do and damned if I don't, though.  I guess that's the nature of the beast.  But if I had said anything, it would have been mocked.  And then kind of just letting, you know, Chris Jericho, Jim Norton, Anthony, and Amy all converse.  Of course I shut the fuck up.  It's a room full of famous people talking about being in situations where they've been pulled over and try to tell them, you know, I'm famous.  I can't relate to it.  It's a room full of famous people and they're all saying, oh, yeah, you know, he might know me from this, he might know me from that. 
[03:28:30]  You know what happens when I get pulled over?  I get a ticket.  That's it.  There's no discussion.  There's no cuteness.  There's no fame.  I have a ticket to pay.  I have traffic court to go to.  That's it.  There's no place for me in that conversation.  I also have to, I mean, on the subject of guests, I woke up to a text this morning from one of my buddies who goes, hey, dude, just saw the Michael Cole interview. 
[03:29:00]  By the way, what, great job.  By the way, what's the shit show?  And I go, well, that's just the joyfulness of having you all as the wonderful audience that you are.  Somebody uploaded the Michael Cole interview from, I think, Tuesday on this very show to YouTube and some of the wrestling websites started picking up on it.  So people are starting to see this and listen to it.  I haven't uploaded a video or anything, but they're starting to listen to it on YouTube.  But, of course, since a fan uploaded it, it says Michael Cole on the shit show on SiriusXM. 
[03:29:30]  And so because reporting now, all you need to do is have a web – you can just post on a website and you're a reporter.  You don't actually have to do any research.  All these wrestling sites are saying –  They're like Yelpers.  Exactly.  They're the same thing.  They're assholes.  You were talking about on your food court show.  Yeah.  Yelpers are assholes.  I mean, just because they can clear a plate, then now they're a foodie.  Exactly.  Because everybody's got a voice, they become the expert.  So now all these, quote-unquote, internet reporters are reporting, in all seriousness, without any mocking or any joke or anything, 
[03:30:00]  Michael Cole stopped by the shit show on the Opie and Anthony channel on SiriusXM.  And so I got people that are like, dude, yeah, I saw your interview, but what's the shit show?  Well, look at Comic-Con.  How many bloggers now?  If you have one blog –  Dude, last year we went to Comic-Con in San Diego.  I swear to God, they hand out – it used to be – because we've been going for years.  And it used to be – everybody goes to Comic-Con.  It's full of celebrities, and you can get interviews there. 
[03:30:30]  Or at least you used to be able to.  Now it's like there are more press credentials given out than there are tickets sold.  They can't sell tickets to Comic-Con anymore because everybody gets a press pass.  And then if they get passed on, some little kid from Kentucky said, I'll trash your movie.  Right.  And you don't know if he has like one person or a thousand person or a hundred thousand.  So you just have to treat everybody like gold.  Like what?  Because – and that's the other thing.  That every now and then one of these websites takes off, and this fucking idiot is actually a guy who talks to – 
[03:31:00]  Like Amy Cole.  Yeah, a million people.  Two million, five million, a billion, however many it is.  But yeah, so I thought that was funny that – because a fan version of the Michael Cole interview went up.  People are – in my life are coming to me.  People in the industry.  Radio industry.  I'm a professional broadcaster.  You know, there aren't many of us left.  Chris Jericho knew your name.  Of course he knows my name.  Chris Jericho and I go way back.  You still mad about Chris Jericho? 
[03:31:30]  A little bit, yeah.  It still bothers you, huh?  A little.  You have a – what's your history with Jericho?  Troy, of course.  I've never actually met him.  No.  You don't actually – you don't have legitimate – you don't have history with him as a person.  It's more you have history with him as an entity and a body of work.  Yeah.  Because back probably, I want to say – I want to say 90 – 99, 2000, somewhere in there.  I was in a band, and we had sealed the deal with Megaforce Records, and we were managed by Johnny Zazula. 
[03:32:00]  Now, it's sealed the deal.  Is that like industry slogan?  Is that industry jargon?  Like we signed a contract.  But what you guys got to say, hey, deal's been sealed.  Yeah.  Basically, I mean, it's – you know, you put it out there like contracts in, ready to go.  Yeah.  Okay.  This guy, you know, discovered Metallica, did a lot for Metallica, did a lot for Anthrax, and so on and so forth, and managed ministry.  I mean, the guy is, you know, he's very well known in the music industry, in the metal industry, I should say. 
[03:32:30]  So when you guys signed to – you guys are like a band trying to make it, and when you guys signed to this label, and specifically this guy.  Yes.  You're like, okay, now we're going to – this is going to be the real thing.  Yeah, and we're hanging out at the guy's house, and the guy's got, you know, Metallica gold records in his bathroom.  So you're thinking TRL.  Yeah, well, I was thinking, you know, something.  I don't know.  I mean, just, you know –  But this is legit.  Some sort of success.  You know, hopefully this guy can take our career to the next level.  So sign the contracts. 
[03:33:00]  We start recording the record, start working on the record, and then all of a sudden he was all excited – our manager was excited about signing Fozzy.  Chris Jericho's band.  Yeah.  Which started as like a goof band.  Yeah.  I mean, since – it's since become a major band.  But at the time, it was a goof.  Like, it was a complete goof.  I mean, yeah, it was called Fozzy Osbourne at the time, and that's when Chris Jericho was showing up.  We talked about him today.  It was very funny, the juxtaposition that's happened, because he would come – he came on the Opie and Anthony show, however many, 13 years ago, to promote Fozzy as Moongoose McQueen. 
[03:33:30]  He had an alter ego.  The whole band was based off of – what's it called?  The Christopher Guest movie.  Spinal Tap.  It's like Chris Gaines and Garth Brooks.  Exactly.  But, yeah, but even weirder, because this guy was a wrestler.  Yeah, that's true.  So –  Yeah, I guess it's just – this came out of the blue?  Yeah, he just started like – he got the guys from Stuck Mojo.  Right.  And he was the singer, and he created this character, and they did like Spinal Tap goof stuff. 
[03:34:00]  And then, you know, they could really play music, but it was all covers.  Yeah.  And that was their thing.  Yeah.  And they made like this fake MTV documentary thing.  Oh, yeah.  Which was – I mean, was – you could tell that Jericho is a giant Spinal Tap fan and just wanted to go out and make his own Spinal Tap.  Right.  And, I mean, it was funny, and me as a wrestling fan, I'm like, fuck yeah, I got the first Fozzy album.  Right.  So –  Much to your Shigurin, I suppose.  Yeah, I'm sure you don't have my old band's record.  I didn't know you were in a band.  At that time, right.  No, no, I had no idea.  So, yeah, so basically the Fozzy comes along, and they sign them, and then completely forget about what we were working on, and that was that. 
[03:34:30]  That was it.  So he signed Fozzy, and he was like, oh, shit, this guy's on television.  Yeah.  Fuck these guys.  Yeah, this guy's already – I don't have to work to get this guy pressed.  Right.  All I have to do is press out these albums, and little wrestling turds like Sam Roberts are going to buy it, regardless of what's on the CD.  And that's what happened.  It could be Chris Jericho farting into a snare drum. 
[03:35:00]  Yeah.  Jericho goes, I ain't farting into no snare drum.  But still, they put the album out, and you guys are left in the lurch.  We put a lot of work into our record, and –  Did it never come out?  No, it came out.  Oh, but it was just no promotion?  Nothing.  You guys were put on what I like to call the pay-no-mind list.  Absolutely.  Wow.  Yeah.  So that stung.  Well, of course, especially because it was a goof.  And you guys knew.  So what did you – so you looked at what Chris Jericho and Fozzy were doing.  And again, Fozzy is a different band now. 
[03:35:30]  Right now, they write their own music.  They perform.  They've played giant metal festivals.  Yeah, no, it's a completely different thing.  Totally different deal.  So you're not taking shots at them now.  No.  So you're more saying we were there, and Fozzy putting out the first goof record  completely took the rug out from under us.  Completely.  Whew.  Yeah.  Took all the wind out of our sail.  Were you guys watching wrestling at the time?  Because that's when wrestling was super cool.  I wasn't, but a couple other people were that we were working with.  Yeah. 
[03:36:00]  You know, they were like, oh, that's cool.  You know, but it was like –  But you the whole time were like, it's not cool.  Well, I stopped caring about wrestling, you know, like, I don't know, late 80s.  WWF.  Right.  Is where, like, bushwhackers.  Right.  Rockers.  Like, that was my shit.  You were a rockers guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sean or Marty?  Oh, Marty Gennetti.  You were a Marty Gennetti guy.  Okay.  I got to tell you now, I know you haven't watched recently.  You made the wrong pick.  Really?  Yeah, but go on.  Go on with your – yeah, it wasn't the right pick, but –  So that's where I got out of it. 
[03:36:30]  I was, you know, as a kid.  So I kind of looked at wrestling, and that's when, like, wrestling was, like, people were  doing, like, backyard shit.  Right.  It was huge at that moment.  So I understand the move, but as the guy who's in the band that didn't get picked, you're  basically like me, who's sitting here going, there are no people left who are professional  broadcasters.  None.  All people want to do is give radio shows and advertise on podcasts hosted by people  that are doing anything except radio.  Yeah.  Whether you could have a magazine, you could have a website, you could be an actress, you 
[03:37:00]  could be a comedian, you could be a musician, whatever you want to be.  You could be a wrestler.  As long as you're not doing radio, you have a shot at getting a show.  Yes.  And I'm looking around, even at SiriusXM, especially at SiriusXM, and all the nincompoops  that are just getting thrown on the air and doing some of the shittiest shows in all  of the, in the medium.  Yeah.  And not the, and when I say medium, I don't mean satellite radio.  I mean broadcasting.  Like all together.  Yeah, like television, radio, film, stage, everything. 
[03:37:30]  Some of the shittiest forms of entertainment.  Now, hidden here are some of the greatest shows.  For instance, this one.  Mm-hmm.  You know what I mean?  Sure.  Opie and Anthony.  Even Howard Stern at times has his moments where he can pull it off.  But, you know, they, they, they drag people in here that are not broadcasters.  They're not professional broadcasters.  And they make it so people like me have no shot because, like you said, the notoriety.  You sound bitter. 
[03:38:00]  No.  I'm just trying to relate to you.  Why do you think that is?  Why do I think what is?  Why do they, why do you think that it works that way?  Well, because it's the same reason that Fozzie, headed by a guy who was established in another  medium who already has a fan base, got ahead.  Because, like I said, this manager is looking at you guys like, this is a good band.  I know I can promote them.  I know I can get them to the next level.  But then he looks at Jericho and says, wait a minute.  This dude's already on the next level. 
[03:38:30]  He just wants to sell some records.  I don't have to do anything.  I don't have to do any work.  I'm not a terribly creative guy.  Otherwise, I would be a musician.  You know what I mean?  It's like, here, like, I'm not a program director.  Well, if you were, like, a super creative dude, you'd probably have a show.  Yeah.  So, they're going, okay.  Well, there's already, I don't have to build an audience here.  I don't have to do it.  Yeah.  That's the one I'm going with.  And it's short-term thinking.  Because eventually, like Jericho said, I'm not going on tour this time because I'm going 
[03:39:00]  to go wrestle at WrestleMania.  Or, you know, whatever, whoever's coming here, oh, we're going to hire this comedian to do  a weekly show.  Yeah, I'm not doing it this week, though, because I'm going to be in Sheboygan.  They're paying me more, so that's where I'm going to be.  Like, everybody who's coming in and doing a band, a radio show, whatever it is, it's  their second priority.  It's not what they're doing.  So, it's never, I mean, Jericho's different because he actually left wrestling for the  band. 
[03:39:30]  But that's a completely unique circumstance.  Yeah.  In almost all circumstances, this is the second priority.  Yeah.  So, what are people going to do?  They're going to make it a second, third, fourth, fifth priority.  Jamie Foxx is not sitting there going, oh, I hope my radio show sounds good.  Right.  Right?  But they can use his name.  Exactly.  Yeah.  So, that, and that's, I mean, it's short, it's short-term thinking.  Well, radio, I mean, a lot of people get fired quickly from radio, so maybe it's just  like, let's just, we need to cash in quickly for that instantaneous gratification of, look 
[03:40:00]  how great we are.  Yeah, because we're, instead of nurturing talent.  Right.  That's the thing.  Because that requires too much work.  And it's risk.  There's no risk that's going to be taken anymore.  We're in a rough economy.  Kids are, want entertainment now.  They don't want to, they don't want to try to take a risk and establish something  because otherwise you're just going to go on YouTube and watch a video instantaneously.  So, we're going to go with something pre-established.  Well, what happens when you run out of stuff that's been pre-established for you?  I don't know if that'll ever happen. 
[03:40:30]  Well, then, but slowly but surely every medium is going to stop establishing new talent because  they're just going to try to get talent from someplace else.  Well, then eventually just podcasts will start building stuff up and then they'll just take  them from there.  Right.  I mean.  That's, that's.  Yeah, but it's not even like, like even for a podcast to get a rub, meaning, you know,  end up with real advertisers, like to, to be able to afford to do a podcast where you  can be at the top of your game, you kind of have to be doing something else. 
[03:41:00]  Right.  So.  So, shouldn't you just set your sights on, forget about radio and just set your sights on  like television?  But this is what I do.  Yeah, but you could do television.  Who's going to hire me to be on television?  I'm not pre-established.  I mean, you know, like, what am I going to like, like, what do I do when I walk in  and they're going, uh, well, why are people going to watch you?  I don't know.  Because I'm entertaining.  Yeah.  Well, you need to get a segment on, uh, the fucking the new tonight show.  All right, cool.  I'll work.  You sound like my mother now.  Like, I had to sit down and talk to my dad and my mom and dad the other day. 
[03:41:30]  I swear to God, weeks, two weeks ago, we were at dinner and that's when all this tonight  show stuff was, you know, popping up in the rumors.  Uh, and my dad is, is telling me like the same stuff that you are and I'm going, I have  to look at him in the face and go, dad, I know you like me.  You're supposed to, you're my father.  The tonight show is not hiring me.  Yeah, but they hired that whack-ass gay dude.  Who?  What's that guy's name?  Oh, Ross?  Yeah.  Yeah, but I don't have that. 
[03:42:00]  Do I?  What do I do?  Yeah, but you're, you're wittier than him.  I know I'm wittier.  I'm wittier than almost everybody I encounter.  And you've had, you've had a viral video.  And people don't want witty though.  People don't want, they want easy.  Oh yeah, that's the dude who acts gay.  Yeah, we could do something with him.  Maybe we'll get some gay people watching.  Yeah, but you got the, the Apple 5 video.  Yeah, that did me a world of good, huh?  Well, you had the viral video.  Well, what number did that come in last year?  I don't remember, but it was, uh, top 30.  Yeah.  Of the year.  Okay.  And 2012 was chock full of viral videos. 
[03:42:30]  So that's impressive.  Yeah.  And I'll remind people of that.  So, you know, don't sell yourself short.  You're right.  I mean, you're just aiming too low.  You think I'm aiming too low?  Well, if I can't get to a, to a low point, it makes it tough to think, to, you know, go  forward and be like, well, I'm going to get even higher then.  I mean, you're not going to, you're not going to change their, their perspective of you.  They're not going to, you're not going to change things around.  So that all of a sudden they start believing in you.  It just doesn't work like that.  You don't think so? 
[03:43:00]  No.  When does it ever work?  So what's the move then?  You just got to do your own shit outside of here.  I'm working on it all the time.  I got What's the Haps with Fandango on YouTube.  Yeah.  That's something, right?  Yeah.  And you had that other broad started, uh, you had her say some shit on there, right?  Who?  Michelle Beadle?  Yeah.  Yeah?  So what's up?  What's up?  You're doing it.  I got friends.  I got, Michelle Beadle and me are direct messaging.  What up, Shoday?  Yeah, exactly.  I didn't actually say that.  I more said like, oh, I hope I didn't get you in trouble with Aaron Andrews.  Too bad you're married. 
[03:43:30]  Otherwise, I'd be like.  You could try to put it in.  I would if I wasn't married.  But I mean, unfortunately, I'm in love with my wife.  What can I do?  You don't think your wife would give you a pass?  For Michelle Beadle?  Yeah.  She probably wouldn't right now because it's like there's at least a 2% chance that it  could happen.  If there was a, like, she might give me a pass for somebody that it, like, 0% chance.  Like who?  Like, who do you think your wife would legitimately give you a pass?  Like, okay, you can fuck this bitch.  I don't know.  Beyonce Knowles?  Yeah.  Realistically, though. 
[03:44:00]  Because then not only do I have to meet her, I have to convince her that I'm cool.  And so cool that she will commit infidelity behind Jay-Z's back.  Right.  And Jay-Z's the king of cool.  He's not as well.  He's old.  You think so?  Well.  You think I could kind of push that sort of young thing?  Yeah.  Hmm.  You know?  Hmm.  I wonder if she'd give me a pass for Genesis Rodriguez.  What's that?  I don't know.  It's this hot chick who's coming in here in a little while.  Today?  Yeah.  You want to hang out?  Sure.  She's hot. 
[03:44:30]  And Rodriguez.  I know you like a little...  Hispanic.  Hispanic.  You like that?  I love Hispanic.  Oh, yeah.  Let me go to Mongo the Trucker.  What's up, Mongo?  Sam, Sirius just called me last night and offered me a show.  God damn it.  Is it the trucking thing?  No, it's on the comedy channel.  It's me driving down the road, talking about what I see, listening to my iPod, telling  horribly unfunny jokes.  And that's it?  Yeah.  And once a month for $2.9 million.  So I think I'm going to take it.  Oh, shit.  Wow. 
[03:45:00]  Yeah, I would take it, dude.  If you're a trucker.  Quite an offer.  Maybe I should start driving a truck.  Maybe that's the trick.  A lot of trucker listeners.  I mean, that's my spin.  Maybe.  Because apparently professional broadcasting doesn't exist anymore.  It really doesn't.  It doesn't, does it?  It's a shame.  I mean, who, like, who would, okay, like, after, like, Howard and O&A.  Exactly.  But there's nobody talented anymore.  You know why?  Because nobody will hire a professional broadcaster and let them, you know why Howard and O&A are  so talented?  Because this is what they do. 
[03:45:30]  But it was also a different time when they came up.  How do you mean?  I mean, what, because people would actually let people broadcast?  No, because it was, it was, it was shocking to be doing what they were doing on the radio.  Yeah, but they're more than shocking.  Like, and even, and, and the way you know that, I mean, look at O&A.  The shocking thing has kind of been done.  You know, you got the gay off every now and then.  But like you said, it was a different time.  So shocking the audience doesn't work right now.  But O&A still pull off a great show every day. 
[03:46:00]  Sure.  But they've been doing it for so long.  Exactly, because they're professional broadcasters.  Right.  And somebody hired them to broadcast.  They didn't have to have, you know, a fucking angle.  But no, I think when they started, though, it was completely different.  It was different.  We got a chance.  I got a presence on the internet.  Just keep, keep rolling with it.  All right.  Keep your chin up.  All right.  You get down, man.  But it's.  You got to keep rolling, right?  Yeah, you got to keep, keep on, keep on.  I mean, I'm going to the WrestleMania press conference today.  Yeah?  You excited about that? 
[03:46:30]  Yeah, it should be fun.  You know?  I mean, I'll pitch myself to Triple H again.  It wouldn't be the first time.  It's good to get these guys in person.  You know, you're like, okay, you can interview Triple H.  Well, how about I use the interview for a job pitch?  How about that?  There you go.  You know?  I can't wait till WrestleMania's over.  Why?  I've just had enough of it.  What do you mean?  Just I'm done with it.  Wrestling's not your thing.  It's just like a little bit's funny.  You know, it's like, all right, come on.  Let me go to Derek in Philly.  What's up, Derek?  Oh, my God.  Troy, I knew I loved you, and I love you even more after you made that fucking point. 
[03:47:00]  About what?  Wrestling.  About wrestling.  I can't stand this shit.  Specifically with Sam.  Sam, you know how you were talking about how you can't get ahead in the industry?  Yeah.  Your obsessions with weird shit, like this little niche market of wrestling and your collection  of toys, it oozes out of you, and it oozes on professionalism.  I'm a professional broadcaster.  You're not. 
[03:47:30]  You're far from it.  My point being, you hone in on such a niche market such as wrestling, it just denies the  majority of the only listeners.  You can't make a connection to it.  You can't.  It's atrocious.  It's awful.  I can agree with this guy.  You can agree with whoever you want, but wrestling is not a tiny niche market.  And besides that, I'm not doing a wrestling show.  I talk to all guy from wrestling during WrestleMania week.  I just can't picture people that run the industry, run the business, and maybe I don't 
[03:48:00]  know.  They don't know what the fuck I'm talking about, but I can't picture them taking somebody  seriously that's way into wrestling.  What about fucking Michelle Beadle?  750,000 followers on Twitter.  Yeah, there's a couple people out there, a handful, but like, you know, look at the demo  of wrestling fans.  I'm special, Troy.  I mean, and I work with you, so I know you're a talented dude.  I'm outside of the demo, okay?  I appreciate things for different reasons.  But I just, I can't picture people taking that seriously.  Plus, go on the YouTube channel, right? 
[03:48:30]  I go to a wrestling press conference.  I interview wrestlers.  I get 100,000 hits on the video.  I know there's people out there, sure, but.  So what am I doing?  How's that doing something wrong?  People that run these companies are a little more intellectual than the people that are sitting  around watching wrestling videos on YouTube?  Look at me interviewing, who do you want?  Terrence Howard.  1,000 views.  How about Snooki and JWoww?  3,000 views.  Oh, there's no denying that wrestling fans are dedicated to.  How about wrestlers?  100,000 views.  Okay, well, why don't they make you a superstar then? 
[03:49:00]  Because I got long hair.  I talked to Michael Cole about that.  Because they're not running the business.  Snowy.  Snowy in Michigan.  Hey, how you doing, Sam?  How are you doing, buddy?  Hey, fuck up there.  You're doing fine, Sam.  You're doing fine.  You're right, Sam.  We talk about wrestling every day.  It'd be different if they called up on every day.  Yeah, you guys are all just getting carried away because it's WrestleMania week.  And by the way, ONA are talking about it too, all right?  Speaking of wrestling, guys. 
[03:49:30]  Yeah.  Speak on it.  Isn't it kind of ironic you guys got your wrestling tickets from Fandango?  Why?  Oh, that is funny.  I never even made the connection.  Fandango, movie tickets, wrestling tickets.  I'm sorry to say that comment.  I mean, yeah, a short show yesterday, obviously, but that's nice.  I like that.  Snowy, that's a good call.  Thanks, man.  Thanks, buddy.  Yeah, it's all over.  If you want to see the Fandango stuff, OB Radio on YouTube has a video.  The SiriusXM account has a video. 
[03:50:00]  And WWE.com posted their version of the video too.  All of them are up on Facebook.  You see my What's the Haps with Fandango?  No, I didn't know it was up.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'll put it up.  I have a What's the Haps.  I don't even know if I want you to put it on the Facebook.  Because the ONA fans that are on our Facebook are all fucking assholes.  Well, they're going to say AIDS nine times.  Yeah, all they do is fuck it.  And then I don't even question whether it's just me.  Because I look at every link that we post on our Facebook page,  and they're all a bunch of assholes. 
[03:50:30]  Just constant negativity.  The people on Twitter are cool, for the most part.  Yeah.  So don't put it up.  Fuck them?  I don't know.  You can put it up if you want.  Right.  Thank God Genesis Rodriguez is here.  Welcome to the show.  I am here.  Well, sit down.  We're on the air.  Oh, all right.  Yeah, so sit down and make yourself comfortable.  Well, thank you.  I was just talking about my plight.  But we can move past that.  Because you're here.  You're bringing the beauty of the room up to a whole new level. 
[03:51:00]  What did I tell you, Troy?  She's beautiful.  Is she not?  Yes, absolutely.  You are sweet.  And you are becoming a very buzzed about actress.  Am I now?  I think so.  I mean, you're getting roles in all these big...  You were an identity thief, right?  Yes, I was.  So, how great is it?  How great is what?  Exactly the movie?  Well, no.  I know how great the movie is because you do this movie and it makes like...  It made like $130 million out of nowhere.  Yeah, it's not a bad thing. 
[03:51:30]  It's not a bad thing for me at all, actually.  Yeah, that's...  Can I put it in perspective?  Okay.  You know how much money Les Mis made?  How much?  That's like this epic movie with all these stars, right?  Yeah.  Les Mis made $150.  You're right there with Les Mis.  Can I tell you something?  Yes.  I feel like I won an NBA championship.  You do?  Yeah.  And you're a big basketball fan, correct?  Huge.  So, that's got to feel great to you.  Oh, you bet.  I mean, it's like me and LeBron James right there.  So, who are you...  What are you moving on to now?  Where do you go from identity thief? 
[03:52:00]  You know, I want to keep it fresh.  I really don't know.  They keep hiring me in these comedies and...  You're just like, I'll do it.  I'll do it.  Yeah.  I'll take what's coming.  No, honestly, I don't want to stick to any certain genre.  I just want to keep it fresh.  And my next movie coming out is, you know, a bit dramatic thriller.  It's with Paul Walker and it's called Hours.  And it basically is a story of Hurricane Katrina. 
[03:52:30]  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  So, it's kind of...  Different than Fast and the Furious, then?  Very.  No race cars?  No, no, no.  Paul turns this one out like crazy.  He does an incredible job here.  When you found out...  Because you were in Casa de mi Padre.  Yes, sir.  It's not a bad accent, is it?  That I just did.  No, no.  Yours was...  Pretty good, right?  It was excellent.  How fantastic was it when you heard that Will Ferrell was doing a comedy in Spanish?  You know, I thought...  I thought...  First of all, I thought it was genius. 
[03:53:00]  Yeah.  And second, I thought I had no chance in hell that they would hire me.  Why?  Because I was a newcomer and I just...  I had no idea that I had any sort of chance.  And I walked in on the first day of auditions and I was the first person they saw.  And Will was laughing at me since I started talking.  So, I was like, oh, I just...  I totally screwed this up.  You thought he was just being like, who invited this?  No, I thought it was like, I was...  I really thought it was... 
[03:53:30]  He was laughing at me.  Yeah.  I thought it was like an American Idol moment, you know, like where you're just...  You were William Hung?  Yeah, I was totally William Hung in my head.  Yeah.  And I was like, okay, there's just nowhere to go.  This guy thinks I'm a buffoon.  I'm just going to go on my day.  And a week later, I got the job.  So, I feel...  I feel good.  Then you found out you were...  You realized at that point you were being funny.  I guess so.  You didn't know before.  I was dead serious.  Are you a comedy fan?  Yes.  You are?  Yes, absolutely.  So, what are some of your favorite comedies?  I mean, it really depends. 
[03:54:00]  I really like, you know, all the family vacation movies, like from that kind of comedies.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I love that.  Yeah.  And I love the raunchy stoner ones as well.  I mean, I'm really...  So, you're an old school fan?  I do.  I like...  I like...  I'm a big Chevy Chase fan.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I like...  I like them all.  So, is it intimidating to go in now and have to work with these guys who are like...  These are seasoned comedy veterans, you know?  You know, if you really start to think of that... 
[03:54:30]  Yeah.  ...then you're going to get in the side of your head and you're going to screw it up.  So, I just...  You really have to have some sort of confidence and just go in there and own it and not care  who they are.  Because if I literally...  If I literally paid attention to Will Ferrell being in the room, I'm like a huge fan of  his.  So, you have to turn your brain off from saying, it's Will Ferrell, it's Will Ferrell, it's  Will Ferrell, it's Will Ferrell.  All I was thinking was like Robert Goulet and like...  Cowbell.  Yeah, the cowbell and...  That's so funny that you look at Will Ferrell and you're just thinking about Goulet. 
[03:55:00]  Goulet.  You know, I just...  I couldn't because I'm like such a fan and if you seriously pay attention to that, you're  just going to...  You're just going to stick your foot in your mouth.  So, you just treat him like a normal person and inside you have to like die a little bit.  Right.  You have to turn your soul off.  Yeah, turn your soul off.  Yeah.  Turn your brain off and just do your damn thing.  This is what you're paid to do.  It's time to go to work.  Now, are you a giant Gillette fan?  Is it that difficult for you as it is like with Will Ferrell? 
[03:55:30]  You know what?  I'm a huge Gillette fan.  I heard that about you.  I use Gillette in my everyday and I'm here because I want men to use it in their everyday.  Tell me about what's going on with Gillette right now.  So, Gillette has this new 3-in-1 Fusion Pro Glide Styler and basically, this is the easiest  tool you can use to trim, shave, and edge.  Why are we doing this? 
[03:56:00]  I don't know.  This is why we're doing this.  Oh.  Because women don't want to see just a mess when you take off your shirt.  Yeah, because I was about to say, this is blue and black.  I was almost certain that this was a man's razor.  It is a man's razor.  That you were talking about.  Okay.  All right, good.  Because I was going to use it, but I didn't want to look effeminate.  No, that's yours.  Great.  Would you like one too?  Yeah, absolutely.  Okay, I'll get you one.  I mean, look, you can tell that this is a guy who takes care of his feet.  He wants to make sure that he's structured and everything.  I see the effort.  Yes.  And I see that your jawline is very, you're working right now. 
[03:56:30]  You're working for me.  Okay.  Wow.  Look at this.  What do you think of the chain?  It's a little much?  A little much, but flashy.  You know.  Keep the bling.  You know what he says?  This is Troy, by the way.  And he says he wears the chain as an expression just to show everybody his wealth.  You know?  Is that right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All gold, everything.  Right.  A little like Trinidad James.  I like that.  Have your money where you can see it.  Right.  Yeah, you do.  Yeah.  That's a quality you look for.  Yeah.  I like this one.  Okay.  Sure.  Yeah, I mean, there are probably smarter things you could do with your money, but sure. 
[03:57:00]  No.  Sure.  But go on.  I didn't mean to interrupt you about why exactly you and Kate Upton.  I mean, hello.  Yeah.  I mean, she's like the hottest girl, right?  Do you get competitive?  Because what's going on is you guys are all doing a YouTube project for Gillette, correct?  Yes.  On April 18th at 12 p.m.  It's live.  So you can ask us any question you want.  It's exciting.  You should get excited about this.  I am getting excited.  I'm sitting down, but trust me, I am getting excited.  I mean, literally, you have the chance to talk to your dream girl, whether it be Kate, Hannah, 
[03:57:30]  I mean, whatever, me, if you want.  I'll bet a lot of you.  But, you know.  It's there, you know.  This is a no-hold bar.  Just ask us anything.  So you guys are just going on YouTube to be asked questions of?  Questions about what women want in a man.  I see.  We're not here to critique any guys.  This is not our job.  Right.  Our job is to help you out and to open a line of communication about what is going on with 
[03:58:00]  your body.  And this is not to...  I have a lot of questions about that, so I'm glad that you're doing this.  Please.  What questions do you have?  I don't know.  There's always weird things going on with my body that I need to...  Do you have any back hair?  No, I don't have any back hair, but I have this weird...  The problem is, you know, like a man will have chest hair, right?  Yeah.  Like a nice...  Like Steve Guttenberg chest hair.  Okay.  But for me, it feels like at some point during puberty, things just ended because I just  get like patches of hair around the nipple area. 
[03:58:30]  Okay.  And I feel like it looks very juvenile.  Okay.  You know what I mean?  Like I feel like if I took my shirt off in front of you, you'd be like, feel a little  kitty toucher-ish right now.  I don't think I want to do this anymore, Sam.  Okay.  You know?  No, no, no.  I get it.  Yeah.  And look, listen, it's not anything crazy and it's not anything that you can't take care  of.  Well, that's why this trimmer will probably shave my nipples well, right?  I think so.  Yeah.  I think it's actually perfect.  It's not about...  Even if you're not comfortable even shaving it, you know, because some guys, oh, I don't  want to shave, you know, trim. 
[03:59:00]  And it's a sensitive area.  I get it.  I get it.  That's why trimming would be perfect for you in your case.  I also...  This razor, because it's called the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide Styler.  And it's a styler.  Yes.  It's more than a razor.  And it's perfect for me.  Because you can see, my hair is a little, we'll say, ethnically ambiguous.  It's kinky, right?  And that means I get razor bumps all the time.  Okay.  So I can't shave with a regular razor.  Okay. 
[03:59:30]  This thing's got a trimmer on it.  Exactly.  I can use this.  Exactly.  No, and listen, you know, it's not about you want to change something about yourself.  It's about, you know, helping yourself out.  Right.  So if you have an area that you know may not be the best that you could work on, trim it.  What about the undercarriage?  Does this...  Now, when you say undercarriage, the pubis area, that's not what you're talking about?  Well, underneath, and even go back a little bit.  You groom all there? 
[04:00:00]  Get rid of it all.  My God.  All of it?  Yeah.  All right.  This guy's got it really going on.  You prefer the whole area being clean?  I prefer everything being clean.  Everything.  There we go.  Everything.  Everything.  Right.  So like a gold chain and no body hair.  It's like, you're like, yes, I'm there.  Did you know it makes everything look better?  It does.  More impressive.  I need help in that department, too.  So that's good to know.  Just do it.  E-Rock, why don't you come in here for a second? 
[04:00:30]  Because, you know, you're there to help guys and tell them what's it to do and not to do.  I get made fun of from wearing a denim shirt.  Denim is very in right now.  Is it not?  I wear denim shirts.  All right.  Good.  All right.  So I'm on the right track with this.  Absolutely.  Great.  Thank you very much.  Yeah.  This is E-Rock.  He's our producer.  Hey, E-Rock.  But I need for you, because obviously there's a lot of problem areas.  Okay.  You know, and that's no secret to anyone.  Okay.  Let's.  And Troy, you'd agree with me there, correct?  I mean, this isn't nice.  There is.  But, no, it is nice. 
[04:01:00]  Because I'm going to tell you what's going to happen.  We're not here to critique anybody.  No.  No, they are.  We're here to help.  We're here to help.  I'm here to help.  Okay.  I know what my intentions are here.  Right.  Genesis Rodriguez is simply put an angel.  She would never do anything evil or mean to you either.  No.  Okay.  Now, this is a little preview to the type of thing that you're going to get to see live  on YouTube April 18th.  Yes.  At 12 Pacific time.  At 12 Pacific time.  Pacific time.  Is that noon Pacific time?  Noon Pacific time, 3 p.m. over here.  Okay.  Now, I mean, where would you start with, where could E-Rock start in terms of getting out 
[04:01:30]  of the house and, you know, finding some good tail?  Listen, I would have to assess, you know, like what's going on underneath.  She's deflecting, so this isn't going to be nice.  You don't have to take the shirt off.  Just lift it.  Yeah, no.  Maybe just the belly.  No, that ain't happening.  Why not?  Are you hairy?  No.  How's the back?  Nothing.  Nothing on the back?  That's very important.  Nothing on the back. 
[04:02:00]  Back hair is very bad.  Barely anything on the arms.  But I do, I, and I will speak for a lot of women, we do not.  Like, it is not cool.  It's not cool.  No, it's like not cute.  I know that it's difficult, like, that you guys don't take care of it because you don't  see it.  Right.  But we see it.  Make the effort is what you're saying.  Yeah, just make the effort.  You ladies do so much to pretty yourselves up.  Dude, we take so much time.  And, like, we really just don't get enough credit for how much time we put into everything.  Like, women are expected to look like Victoria's Secret models. 
[04:02:30]  Right.  But guys need to do the same kind of effort.  Just a little bit.  Plus, with this Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler.  Yeah.  All it's going to take is buzz, buzz, buzz.  You're reaching behind you.  It's really not that difficult.  It's not that difficult.  And it should be so normal, like, brushing your teeth and combing your hair.  And shaving your back.  Shave your back.  Right.  Trim your nipples.  Right.  What is the big deal here?  You're right.  Maybe if I even take, like, a little pair of, like, eyebrow scissors and just try to gently  go follicle by follicle, if need be. 
[04:03:00]  It's a sensitive area.  It is.  So just stick to trimming.  Okay.  Okay.  And you...  I don't want to cut anything off by mistake.  No.  No.  No.  Be very careful.  Thank you.  And you...  I see nothing.  Nothing to change about you.  No, you're correct.  Oh, I was going to say.  I see nothing that we can do with you.  No.  I predicted the wrong end of that sentence, and that's my fault.  I think he's going on.  You're attracted to E-Rock.  He's...  He's...  Are you a confident guy?  Do you walk into a room and own it? 
[04:03:30]  Doesn't exactly set the room on fire.  I mean, you saw him come in here.  It was kind of like a...  You know, whose rock collection was just dropped on the table.  That kind of thing.  You...  You...  No, I'm just...  It's just an observational thing.  That wasn't a shot.  We're not here to criticize E-Rock.  I'm surely not.  Neither am I.  Um, I think, you know, when you walk into a room, make yourself...  Your presence known.  Right.  That's...  Oh, they know I'm there.  They know I'm in the room.  He takes up so much space.  And you can hear him walking from a mile away. 
[04:04:00]  Thud.  Like, do you think he should announce himself or something?  Like, when he comes in the room, his nickname is the Sex Bagel.  The Sex Bagel?  Uh-huh.  Do you think that's a good nickname?  I...  I mean...  Like, what if he has it with confidence, though?  I am the Sex Bagel.  Right.  Right.  Something like that.  Yeah, that's kind of cool.  All right, so then, do you think you could try one thing for me?  Leave the room.  Yeah.  And then enter back in and say,  Ladies, the Sex Bagel is in the house.  Ugh.  No, I think that'll work. 
[04:04:30]  That is such a douche move.  Or...  And we'll just...  Or, you could be like,  Sex Bagel, out!  Something like...  Oh, yeah, that would be great.  And leave a room.  If you...  If you leave...  Just try leaving.  Come back in after so we can assess.  But just leave the room right now and just be like,  Sex Bagel, out!  And then maybe say something real cool, like,  Deuces, and throw up a peace sign.  Deuces!  Something like that.  That's cool, right?  I think it's cute.  We'll see what Genesis thinks of that.  We'll try it.  All right, go ahead, you rock.  We'll just... 
[04:05:00]  We'll see what...  We'll see what...  What Genesis thinks.  It'll be great.  Do it here or at the door?  I mean, as you're leaving.  We'll have Sal, you know, throw a mic on you.  You'll be good.  Okay, so he's leaving right now.  Everyone, Sex Bagel out!  Deuces!  You!  I mean, Genesis, I think that was wonderful.  That was a huge improvement.  Do you think so?  Yeah, right?  Do you think so?  I think so.  I think he made his presence known. 
[04:05:30]  Uh-huh.  You know, he seemed like he got it going on.  Like, that's the type of guy...  Confidence leaving.  That's the type of guy who, when he came in,  you were going,  I don't know,  they're kind of busting his balls,  he's not really defending himself.  Yeah, he's kind of quiet.  But then on his way out,  you were like,  Who is that?  Who is the Sex Bagel?  I want to know more.  Yeah, you do, right?  I swear, no,  because, I mean,  Sex Bagel is not a common nickname.  No.  You haven't encountered it in your travels?  No, no.  Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  Well, E-Rock, congratulations. 
[04:06:00]  You...  You did it.  Thank you very much.  You...  Yeah.  Can I get a free razor?  Yes, you can.  Nice.  And you get a free razor,  and you get a free razor.  This is like being on Oprah.  This is wonderful.  It's like Christmas here today.  Well, look,  you can get Genesis Rodriguez on Twitter  at Jenny Rodriguez, right?  Yes, G-E-N-I Rodriguez.  And, you know,  don't take me too seriously.  I'm always talking a lot of crap.  Yeah, but we don't criticize.  We help.  Oh, we don't criticize. 
[04:06:30]  No.  Yes, I love everyone.  I am nonjudgmental.  Right.  I am open-minded.  Right.  We're here to help.  Like, I mean, you're...  Gay marriage, all for it, right?  Heck yeah.  Because we're open-minded.  Heck yeah.  What everybody lived in lives.  I love everybody.  Everybody should love everybody.  It's going to be great.  Orgies for everyone, right?  Whatever's up.  Whatever's up.  Whatever you're into.  Whatever you're into.  Whatever's happening,  you're down for whatever.  Whatever's.  Well, if you have any more questions  for Genesis Rodriguez,  make sure April 18th.  April 18th.  At noon Pacific time. 
[04:07:00]  Pacific time.  Which is 3 p.m. on the East Coast.  Yeah.  You're there live.  Yes.  It's going to be on YouTube.  Kate Upton's going to be there.  It's going to be like just  a hot chick showdown  answering all your questions  on how you too  can get the hot chicks.  And I would think  that having the Gillette Fusion  Pro Glide Styler  would be a lot of help.  Absolutely.  If you help yourself,  it shows a lot about yourself.  It shows that you  take care of yourself.  You're capable of  taking care of a woman.  I mean, it all 
[04:07:30]  is a personal reflection.  Right.  Because if you're sitting there  and you're looking a mess,  a woman's going to look at you  like this isn't the guy  that's going to take care of me.  Yeah, at all.  Like this guy  can't take care of himself.  How the hell am I going to expect  he can take care of me?  Exactly.  You know?  Whereas you look at Troy  and you're like  there's a guy with a gold chain.  Obviously he treats himself all right.  There's a guy  that has, you know,  wall styled jawline.  Do you use a styler  for that jawline?  No, I just use a shaver.  You can get a lot of trimmer  with this thing, Troy.  I tried to use it.  Yeah.  It's going to be great.  Yeah.  Well, Genesis, 
[04:08:00]  thank you for being here.  You're very welcome.  I'm so happy to be here.  All right.  We will,  Rod and Fez are coming up next  April 18th on YouTube.  Don't forget.  Goodbye, everybody.  Bye-bye.  Sex Bagel out!  Deuces!  And Zoe over.  The Hobfan & Anthony show  is now over  Faridah at左岸  over.  Faridah at左岸  over.  Faridah at左岸  over.  Faridah at左岸  over.
