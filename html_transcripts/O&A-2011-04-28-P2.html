<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony After Show, hosted by Sam Roberts with Trevor and Travis filling in for E-Rock (suffering from "Tim McGraw concert fever"), began with the unusual sight of numerous children roaming the SiriusXM hallways, even near the glass-walled O&A studio.  The hosts then played a clip from Nick DiPaolo's Showtime special, "Raw Nerve," focusing on his jokes about Obamacare and the technological struggles of the elderly.

A large segment was dedicated to a recent Brie Olson interview.  Sam, Trevor, and Travis developed a recurring joke, interpreting Olson's repeated "no comment" responses as affirmative "yeses," leading to much speculation and a playful game of decoding her non-answers. They also aired an older O&A clip from 2008 featuring Olson's first or second appearance on the show with guests Bob Kelly and Marc Maron. This older clip revealed Olson had a crush on someone in the studio, ultimately identified as Jim Norton.

The show included discussion of an inappropriate adult film clip featuring a fake penis, resulting in humorous and explicit commentary.

The latter half shifted to behind-the-scenes SiriusXM happenings.  This included conversations with Kim from Sales regarding promotions, and a substantial segment about Derek ("D-Boy"), a production staff member known for his unique relaxation method: fulfilling listener bumper sticker requests and creating bizarre, unsent audio productions. One such creation, "Paul Reiser Breaks with a Z," was played on-air.  The show concluded with continued speculation about E-Rock's absence, jokingly referred to as the "sex man" and "sex bagel," further fueled by ambiguous "no comment" responses mirroring those of Brie Olson earlier in the show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The virus. Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  That's what it is. It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  I'm Sam Roberts. Apparently, it must be bring your kid to work day today.  Because as we're cleaning up the ONA studio here,  everybody that's passing by has a kid with them.  And there's all these children. That's the best part about having a glass studio. 
[00:00:30]  You always know what's going on.  There's all these children that are just wandering around the hallways.  At some points in this building, that would be perfectly fine and safe  if they're over in the Hits 1 area.  But, I mean, I probably don't think it's a great idea to have children  wandering around the completely transparent Opie and Anthony studio.  I'd like to get some kids in here today on the show, I think.  Let's see. I see Roland talking to Spencer out there.  The Talent Bookers.  Let's see if we can book someone's kids on today's show. 
[00:01:00]  This is a very special After Opie and Anthony Live.  Of course, everybody's used to me as the host, Sam Roberts.  And then my right-hand man is usually E-Rock the Sex Bagel.  Nagel, as he likes to be called.  That's why I'm laughing so much.  Unfortunately, E-Rock's not here.  He has a case of Tim McGraw concert fever.  Trevor, and Travis, you're in his spot.  I'm covering for the sex man today.  The sex man.  Do you think? 
[00:01:30]  Because, I mean, that's a big gap to fill, not metaphorically, but just physically.  The space that he takes up is a lot.  Do you think that you have what it takes to fill the E-Rock role today?  To fill his space?  Absolutely not.  No, no, no.  What about metaphorically?  Metaphorically and job-wise?  Absolutely.  Yeah, and you're saying that you do it with ease.  Without a doubt.  Now, how come your kid's not here?  You have a kid.  Yeah, I don't think they're allowed to be here if they're under a certain age.  What?  And I'm working, so, wow. 
[00:02:00]  Why would you bring your kid here?  It's work.  I have things to do.  Yeah, it doesn't make any sense.  No.  Because I just saw another kid walking around.  They're little kids.  They shouldn't be walking by the studio at all.  Speaking of that, we were sounding a bit like children towards the end of the show telling  duty stories.  Because Nick DiPaolo didn't quite know what to make of it, but his Showtime special is  going to be on this Saturday night.  We didn't talk about it probably as much as he would have liked, or probably we should  have, but it's going to be on this Saturday night.  It's Nick DiPaolo's Showtime special, Raw Nerve. 
[00:02:30]  He uploaded a clip to YouTube from Raw Nerve, and I pulled the audio off of that clip.  So you could probably just go to YouTube, but if you're in your car or something, I'm here  for you.  This is a clip from Nick DiPaolo's upcoming special, Raw Nerve.  It's going to be on Showtime this Saturday night, and here it is on After Opie and Anthony  Live.  Obamacare's coming down the pike.  This guy's...  He's still trying to sell this piece of shit.  He's talking about e-healthcare now.  You see him explaining this? 
[00:03:00]  He's like, well, e-healthcare combines 21st century healthcare technology with the interconnectivity  of the internet.  This way, elderly people can have video checks with their doctors.  With their doctors.  Oh yeah, that's going to work out great.  What goes better together than old people and computers, you know?  My parents just mastered the remote control on their VCR two weeks ago.  Now you want my dad to Skype his proctologist at three in the morning?  Mr. DiPaolo, it's Dr. Sampson. 
[00:03:30]  I got your email with a JPEG attached, but it wasn't a picture of your last bowel movement.  It was you and your wife in Antigua playing frisbee with some naked guys.  Well, their asshole looks fine.  I don't know about yours, but...  See, Nick DiPaolo makes bowel movement jokes as well.  You'll hear all that this Saturday night on Showtime with Nick DiPaolo's raw nerve.  Kevin Pollack just walked by the studio and he looked in.  I think he definitely would have given Opie and Anthony dirty looks if he had seen us. 
[00:04:00]  Because I think...  Yeah.  Mark Zito just walked in.  You could just say yes or no.  Was Kevin Pollack annoyed when he walked by the Opie and Anthony studio?  You don't know.  He came in ahead of you.  Don't worry.  It's not your responsibility to keep up with Kevin Pollack.  But, yeah, thank God he just saw my dopey ass in here.  Because he probably would have been annoyed if he had seen Opie and Anthony just sitting in here having the time of their lives. 
[00:04:30]  Not only by themselves, but with another comedian, Nick DiPaolo.  Why do you think he'd be annoyed?  Well, because, obviously, he's promoting something or other here.  And he probably would have loved to have chatted with Opie and Anthony.  But I guess the schedules just didn't meet up.  He must have had a call time of 10.28.  Yeah, I don't think he was in until just now.  Yeah, just literally.  This was the earliest possible time he could come in.  Did D-Boy just walk in there?  Let's get D-Boy on him, Mike.  What's he working on?  Well, let's see. 
[00:05:00]  Hang on.  I'm not talking, man.  I just heard you.  You just did.  Derek, what are you working on?  Trying to get worse of the week.  He's trying to get worse of the week, he says.  Well, how can you go?  I mean, I'm in here doing stuff.  Sam says he's in there doing stuff.  Put your headphones on so you can hear Sam.  Yeah, come join the show, D-Boy.  Everybody wants to know.  He's very mysterious.  He doesn't talk much.  What?  You don't talk much, D-Boy.  Everybody's very interested in how you work.  No, they're not.  Yes, they are.  All right, well, never mind.  Derek refuses to come to the microphone. 
[00:05:30]  What are you working on?  I'm doing worse of the week.  Well, how could you?  I can't voice it right now.  I know.  I've got to pick the clips out.  Oh, what are you thinking?  I don't know.  Well, I mean, Nick DiPaolo is in today.  Yeah, him.  What about Brie Olsen?  I didn't hear it.  No?  What about Kevin Pollack?  I didn't hear it either.  D-Boy's a busy guy.  He's very busy.  Derek creates a lot of production for him.  Matter of fact, a little later on in the show, I think we should play D-Boy's latest piece 
[00:06:00]  of production that hasn't been sold right on the Opie and Anthony show.  We can definitely do.  The Paul Reiser piece.  But in the meantime, we spoke to Opie as it was associated with the Brie Olsen interview  today.  She didn't say a lot.  There were a lot of no comment on that.  But she said that she spoke more to us than she has to anybody else.  I caught up to Opie as he was going to the restroom following that interview.  Opie, I think the Brie Olsen thing was a big get this morning. 
[00:06:30]  How is the show feeling about it?  She's a friend of the show, obviously.  A lot of listeners disappointed.  What?  In the interview in general because we didn't get much out of her.  Well, we did get the news that Jim wanted to have a baby with her.  Oh, that's true.  But they wanted to know about Charlie Sheen.  We basically gave her a pass today.  We didn't push too hard.  But this is what will make it interesting for the replay today.  We just discussed it. 
[00:07:00]  We just finished the interview.  Every time someone says no comment to a question, that is a yes.  So when you listen to the replay today, you're going to hear a lot of no comments.  She says no comment a lot.  Those are all yeses.  So we can just take those as yeses and finish the questions.  Watch.  I'll prove my point.  Sam Roberts, are you gay?  No comment.  No, you would say no, obviously.  Oh, that's right.  Why would you ruin my bit?  Why is it no comment?  But if you ask someone like, are you gay? 
[00:07:30]  Okay, then I would say no.  Yes.  But if you really were, you would say no comment.  No comment.  Well, then I hope I...  See, stupid Sam was trying to go for a bit there  when the real answer was the right answer.  Jeez, that was no bit.  That was the truth.  Kenny.  Do you like to wear dresses when you're not here at Sirius?  I don't know how to answer that.  He wants to say no comment to go with...  We want to go with our own bit. 
[00:08:00]  But why are you guys ruining the genius of this?  This is the second time you've accused me of ruining your bit.  For the listeners out there, you know, to a friend of yours or maybe an employee,  ask a touchy question today.  And if they go, hell no, I don't fucking wear dresses.  But if they go, no comment to that.  Yeah.  That's a yes.  Or I don't really talk about that.  That's a yes.  So now listen to the Brie Olson interview during the replay today.  Every time she says no comment, put a yes in your head. 
[00:08:30]  Double listeners.  And you're going to get a great interview.  Fantastic.  Kenny, are you going to do that?  Ask Opie where he's going.  He'll say no comment.  That doesn't even make any sense.  Where are you going, Opie?  No comment, Sam.  I don't get that.  It doesn't make any...  The context doesn't work.  That time I heard the door slam.  No, but Opie is absolutely right in what he says.  Did you hear what he said?  No comment.  It's almost like a skit, the comedic timing of that was so good. 
[00:09:00]  Well, Brie Olson did call in.  And people were like a little put off that she didn't talk about Charlie Sheen more today.  But what people are forgetting is we found out more about Jim Norton and Brie Olson's relationship or whatever it was than we ever had before.  I mean, they spoke of...  Jim spoke of wanting to impregnate Brie Olson.  And Brie responded to that affirmatively.  It was a fantastic interview, if you ask me.  And that's going to be, of course, on the replay that starts at 3 o'clock. 
[00:09:30]  But what we did was we went back into the show archives, and this was one of the first times that Brie Olson did O&A.  It was back in 2008.  She came in with Caden Cross, whose voice you don't really hear on this clip, but that's okay.  I'm sure at some point you'll hear her voice again.  Who else was in studio?  Bob Kelly and Mark Maron were both in studio.  Brie Olson was in.  This is maybe the second time...  It was either the first or second time she had been on O&A.  Again, it was back in 2008, and this was the moment that we found out she had a crush on somebody. 
[00:10:00]  Now, obviously, today, we found out the news that she had sex with Jim Norton.  So some of that mystery is no longer there.  But when we talk about romance, such as Brie and Jim, we like to go back to where it all came from.  So here it is in the beginning.  Jim Norton and Brie Olson on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After O&A Live.  Oh, my gosh.  Hey, Brie, is it true you got a crush on someone in this room?  I'm sorry?  I'm hearing some communique that you might have a crush on someone in this room. 
[00:10:30]  What?  Who told you that?  Tell them to shut up.  Shut up.  This Brie Olson has a crush on someone in this room.  Shut up.  Mark Maron is working right now.  Someone in this room she has a crush on.  It's Jimmy Norton.  It's always Jimmy.  It's got to be Jimmy.  Jimmy's the cutest.  It's Anthony.  It's got to be Anthony.  Oh.  Is it Anthony?  Brie, look at me.  Holy shit.  Brie, look at me.  She really has a crush on someone in this room.  Is it Anthony?  It has been confirmed, too, by the way. 
[00:11:00]  Really?  Oh, my goodness.  Am I right?  I'm not saying anything.  I think we found her a bit.  Steve.  She's a little schoolgirl right now.  She's got a crush on someone in this room.  See her giggling?  I can't believe someone.  Who's tattling on me?  Who tattled?  You know.  We've got our ways.  That's so not nice.  You want to say it?  Uncle Paul, right?  You want to say who you got a crush on?  No.  Wow. 
[00:11:30]  Hmm.  Who could it be?  Who could it be?  This is good radio.  This is really good radio.  Who's process of elimination?  Is it Opie?  No, it's not me, obviously.  I wouldn't be asking that question.  It's not Anthony.  Is it Marc Maron?  Oh, it's not me?  Fuck it.  Fuck this bit.  Wait, this bit sucks.  Let's read her body language.  Is it Marc Maron? 
[00:12:00]  Is it Robert Kelly?  Is it Jim Norton?  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  She has a kind of good poker face.  She's got a really good poker face.  I'm going to keep on smiling at everyone.  She has no tells.  No tells.  No tells.  I just want to eliminate myself from this contest right off the get-go.  She had one tell that almost got a 25-year-old in big trouble.  Bobby needs to know it's not him.  I know it's not me.  He's freaking out inside.  I already know it's not me.  All right.  I just met her today.  Is it in this room right now, or did somebody leave?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:12:30]  Am I answering, or is she?  You've got to answer your question.  I'm not answering.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I know nothing.  She's not saying she has a crush.  Somebody's saying that.  She's not saying that.  Yeah, but she said, oh, my God, there's a tattletale.  Yeah, no, it's good.  It's confirmed.  How do you know?  You don't know, no.  Yeah, I know.  What's your name again?  Your publicist might have said a thing or two.  Kaylin?  Oh.  That's messed up.  Yeah.  She's going to get out when I get out of here.  Can we turn the 9-11 stuff off?  I can't see people crying and then them looking over here. 
[00:13:00]  Just look at the TV on the bottom.  Yeah, she's waiting for a Jehovah's Witness to come over.  Oh, my God.  The Jehovah's Witness is at the door right now.  There's a little girl laying in a fucking clown nose.  She's probably sitting.  Where's the Jehovah's Witness in the suit?  Yeah, she's just laying there under the beeswax.  And Al Pacino's laying, sitting next to her.  Hey, how did you shoot so high?  Look at her leg up.  Nice nose.  She's ready.  She's a little pervert.  Yeah.  Oh, look, she has Danny's hair. 
[00:13:30]  Fucking awful leg hair.  Well, Brie Olsen has a crush on somebody, yes.  A crush?  What is this?  Junior high?  That's how it was told to me to crush.  That's how it feels like in my heart.  Oh.  Wow.  Fuck.  My God.  Well.  So what's going on in the street?  How could we find out?  Is there a way to...  That's what I'm...  I think we each individually go in an empty room with her. 
[00:14:00]  For seven minutes in heaven?  I think we probably spin the bottle.  That's what I'm saying.  While I'm kissing Jimmy...  For the full seven minutes.  She's a full round of crush.  We're just jerking each other.  Pacino impressions.  Me and Opie knocking on the door.  We're not gay.  We had our hopes up.  Oh, shit.  How are we going to do this?  You got to tell this person you have a crush on him. 
[00:14:30]  No, I don't.  I'm sure you do.  What kind of rule is that?  That's not in the handbook.  What kind of rule is that?  That's a good rule.  It's the rule of life.  Where's the...  It's the rule of life.  Where's the publicist?  Are you the publicist?  Where is the publicist?  Just come to the door.  I like how Kaylin's so far away.  Why are you so far away?  They put me here.  Come on, move.  Steve really did not set the room up.  We were going to have...  Wait, wait.  We were going to have...  Yeah, I was supposed to be over there.  I want to confirm this.  That's Brie Olsen's publicist, right?  She's lovely. 
[00:15:00]  She has a crush on someone in this room, right?  I like the publicist.  She's lovely.  Oh my gosh, I'm getting fucked.  What?  Hey!  There we go.  Is that you?  Wow, that's...  I always spelled your name wrong.  Wow, whoever you have a crush on  better fucking be packing.  Sorry, he's probably...  No, that...  I swear to God,  I thought that was a fucking arm.  That's like...  That's barely moving in and out.  It's not even real. 
[00:15:30]  That's fake.  It is fake, right?  Yeah.  When they have those giant, giant dick ones,  you can always see  they hold it at the base  and it's like that fucking awful fake...  You're giving away porn?  No.  It's real.  Most of them are,  but these...  Why is this called combat, by the way?  Oh.  I'll watch it because I guarantee  there's a little hose in there  that shoots a combat.  Yeah.  Like a ridiculous amount.  Like it's like a shower.  Yeah, like a fire hose.  It looks like a honey bun.  Yeah.  You're using the wrong water fountain, boy.  Yeah.  I remember that day. 
[00:16:00]  I do.  You do?  Yeah.  I would think you would.  That was...  How did you forget that?  You know...  You're getting a whiffball.  A lot of them I do forget,  but that one was about two months  since the industry.  I'd only been in about two months.  Wow.  Is that some sort of rites of passage  and initiation or something?  No, it looks like it's really...  But really, it's only...  This much is in there  and it's just going back and forth like this.  About two inches.  Right now, we're sitting, by the way.  She's on her hands and knees  with her face in the bed.  Oh.  There's a black guy putting  what looks like a massive dick inside 
[00:16:30]  and Bernie's spanking her.  But apparently, it's a fake penis.  It's very shiny.  It's too shiny.  Yeah.  It's not going all the way in.  And the base is too shiny.  You should not be able  to see yourself in a cock.  What a...  It's too shiny.  You've got a great fuck ass, though.  What a perfect ass.  That is just a great...  God bless you.  Great fucking going on there.  I like the way her neck  is bent all the way back.  And his big, dumb, shiny,  fake, plastic penis  is really...  Yeah.  Ain't even real.  Look at the fucking...  How perfect that ass is.  There you go.  It's Keith Robertson. 
[00:17:00]  It's Keith Robertson.  God damn it.  I'll fuck you for Philly.  Philly.  I don't pay for nothing.  Oh, my God.  Uh-oh.  Come bath.  Where's the come bath?  Wow.  Was that in your butt?  Oh, no.  It wasn't in my ass.  Look at...  I probably would have taken it  better in my ass  than my pussy, though.  Oh, my God.  Look at my face.  I'm like, fuck this.  Where's the come bath?  Is that what that was?  Yeah, basically.  Fake rubber cock.  Now you're sucking on it.  Did that taste like a telephone?  Yeah, that's about  what it tasted like.  That's how I would describe it. 
[00:17:30]  How mad was that guy  that he had to put  a fake dick in your mouth  while he's naked?  Yeah.  How embarrassing is that?  Oh, come bath.  Oh, I gotta see the come bath.  This is...  Watch it squirt out.  What is it?  What do they use?  Yeah, what do they use for that?  It's like a pina colada mix.  Who uses a Krispy Kreme machine?  That is so fucking impossible.  You know...  Jesus!  Look how much it's coming out.  It's ridiculous.  Now we know why it's called comeback.  Yeah.  Wait, the guy left the room.  The dick is still coming.  It's like the fucking...  This is just silly. 
[00:18:00]  It's like the vomit scene  in the fucking...  Yeah, Monty Python.  No, I was thinking the other one.  Exorcist or...  No, I was thinking...  Meaning of life?  Is that sugar?  No.  The puppets.  Pina colada mix.  Oh, um...  Yeah, yeah.  Team America.  You guys would be surprised  on how many people email me  and say,  Hey, I seen you on this site.  Is that really real?  And, you know,  people ask all the time.  That's crazy.  How many of the guys...  They gotta dream those people.  That guy would...  If that was real, 
[00:18:30]  he would get a girl pregnant  every time he's fucked.  Just shooting it up  into her fucking abdomen.  And then give her an abortion  immediately after.  Fucking 13 twins stuck together.  We're getting away  from the crush thing  and I can't let this go.  And Bree, did you...  Why don't you eat  your fucking yogurt now?  I'll be...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Someone just did it  on my face.  Very funny.  I can be funny.  Bree also said earlier  that you're available  and looking, right?  Uh-oh.  Remember the last time 
[00:19:00]  that happened?  She said she's available  and looking  and we just brushed by that  and we're also finding out  that she has a crush  on someone in this room.  Mm-hmm.  Danny wasn't in the room.  Bree, you got a crush on Danny?  She keeps looking at the publicist  like,  I'm gonna kill you.  But maybe this is how  we get something going.  Maybe you're like really shy  and you would've never,  you know,  done anything with this crush.  Um, you're probably right.  That is so weird.  Can we just speed the crush up?  It's like everyone's,  everyone's holding  their lottery tickets. 
[00:19:30]  But they're not  giving the numbers out.  Nobody wants to open  the Wonka bar  and look for the golden ticket.  Yeah, because you can fucking,  grandpa has bed sores.  A bunch of guys  are just gonna be sitting here  with chocolate bars  and one is gonna be,  oh, you did it, Charlie.  Balls deep.  It's, uh,  wow.  It's a little Jimmy Norton.  Is it?  Wow.  It has to be said.  Yes.  Wow.  It just has to be said.  I can't let this one go.  What's not to like  about a little Jimmy, though?  Because he's,  he's, uh,  he's cute. 
[00:20:00]  He's got the little lips  that he likes to lick  and make him shiny.  What do you like about Jimmy,  Brie Olsen?  Everything.  It's out.  Now you gotta talk about it.  Is that true  or are they just  throwing him to the box?  What makes you think  that it's Jimmy for?  Look at,  look at Jimmy, right?  Look at,  look at Jimmy, Justin.  Look at Jimmy.  Brie, look at Jimmy.  She can't look at you.  Look at Jimmy.  Look at Jimmy in the eye.  She's not,  she's not an adult  film store anymore.  She's a little girl.  A little girl.  All right.  If it's not Jimmy,  pull both your boobs out.  And then if it is, 
[00:20:30]  do that.  I'm gonna go pee  to the bathroom.  Wow.  Why?  Are you uncomfortable  by all this?  I gotta try and take shit.  I just really have to go pee.  I drink this whole bottle  of Fiji water.  Use the studio,  use the studio to it.  Look at Jimmy.  What?  I will when I get back.  We have a bathroom  right in the studio.  Use the bathroom,  the studio bathroom.  Really?  Yeah.  It's Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Well, let's do it then.  Let's do a Brie Olsen  pissing video right here.  Jimmy got the right.  Jimmy gets rolling 
[00:21:00]  his fucking eyes.  Somebody hold Jimmy.  Strap Jimmy down.  Somebody get the straps.  I have to go pee though.  Wow.  There she goes.  There she goes.  Going off to the bathroom  to pee.  All right.  Would you fuck her,  Jimmy?  What?  Would you fuck her,  Jimmy?  Would I fuck her?  I mean,  I like her.  I know Brie.  I like her.  Would I fuck her?  If my mother died,  I would push my father  away from the coffin,  throw Brie on top  of my mother.  On top of your dead mother. 
[00:21:30]  And fuck her.  And then tell dad  to shut up  because he's cock blocking.  Cry later, dad.  After ONA,  it's live.  And that's how it all started  with Jim and Brie Olsen.  It's after Opie and Anthony live.  We don't play  that drop enough anymore.  I gotta go try  to take a shit drop  that was played.  I remember we used  to play it constantly  and we don't anymore.  But that was Brie Olsen.  And another part  of that clip I liked  was how we got to,  we got, 
[00:22:00]  we can hear you whispering.  You're whispering  into the microphone.  You can't hear me.  What are you talking about?  Well,  what I was going to say  is I liked that we could  show her her work  and she would watch with us  and talk about  how great it was.  Roland,  today apparently  is Kids Day  at the studio.  Yeah.  There's a lot of kids  running around.  Yeah.  I said  that I wanted  to try to book  like some kids  to come in.  Really?  And all we got  is this chair.  Kim.  Kim from Sales  is here. 
[00:22:30]  Hi,  what's going on?  Well,  I saw you wandering  around the hallway  and your office  is not up here.  It's not,  no.  I have been banished  to the 19th floor.  So what are you doing  up here?  I came to talk  to you guys  just to say hello.  Oh, hello.  Actually,  I came to talk  to Travis.  I have to talk  to Travis  about something  specifically.  What is it?  It's confidential.  I can't,  I can't devolve  to that on there.  Travis,  do you know  what it is?  No,  I mean,  we might as well  talk about it now,  though.  I guess  something to do  sales.  Yes.  Sales?  Promotions,  things of that nature.  What kind of promotions  do we have coming up?  First of all, 
[00:23:00]  here's the question  for sales.  Why no live reads  in the 10 o'clock hour?  You know what,  Sam?  I think,  I don't know.  Everybody.  Who said I suck?  Tim Reese.  You never said that.  You did?  Yeah,  right before she came in,  she goes,  do I have to talk  to this asshole?  Well,  then why would she  have come in  if she had said that?  It was completely voluntary.  That's why I came in  to find out why.  Are you sure  she wasn't talking  about you,  Roland?  That could be it.  That could be it.  Roland,  you had a difficult  day yesterday  in that I caught you  sleeping multiple times. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah,  I blame Travis for that.  Wow.  Because he,  he,  he read me out.  Well,  just because he told me  you were sleeping  does not make it mean  that it was his fault  that you were sleeping.  You see that logic?  No,  I don't.  Okay.  Are you doing  a little better today?  Yeah.  Why?  I said peacefully  because Eric wasn't here  and Travis was too busy.  So you're feeling  better right now  because you were able  to get some sleep.  That's right.  Why isn't Eric here?  The sex bagel,  you know,  the sex man.  But I don't think 
[00:24:00]  that's for Eric though.  Are you kidding?  What?  That's not for Eric.  What is it?  Why he isn't here.  Well,  we're on the air.  But you can't talk  about why he's not here.  Well,  I'm asking you.  I can't.  No comment.  Like Brie also says.  No comment.  What is it pertaining to?  Is he with Charlie Sheen  right now?  Is that why?  Yeah.  What's the controversy?  Roland,  you're really starting  to make this controversial.  Travis,  is this as controversial  as Roland's making it out to be?  I don't know.  Maybe Roland knows  something we don't know.  That's what I'm starting to think.  Roland,  why isn't Eric here? 
[00:24:30]  No comment.  Oh my gosh.  Sounds serious.  Kim,  do you know why Eric is here?  I don't know.  You used to air,  you used to be the voice  of Q&A with O&A,  correct?  Used to be.  What happened with those?  I don't know.  I'd like to ask you  that question.  Why me?  I heard they were very popular.  I heard that a lot of people  enjoyed them.  Who was the producer  who made them?  Well,  I think it was you.  Oh.  And I believe Troy  also helped out with that.  Well,  then that would be  a Troy question,  I think.  Direct all your questions  towards Troy.  Because I know  he was auditioning.  I'm a little  auditioning people for it. 
[00:25:00]  Don't even worry about it.  Don't even worry about it.  I'm hurt.  Are you?  Yeah.  Well,  Troy's running down right now.  Look at him run.  What's he holding?  His jizz.  Is that a cup of jizz?  Yeah,  I think so.  Troy,  you look ridiculous  running down holding that cup.  I can't believe  that it's your fault,  Troy.  Yeah,  I was eating something  so I needed somebody  to wash it down with.  Oh.  Oh,  see,  that's what I hate them people.  They've never had their breath.  You mean fit people?  Yeah.  I also run like  five miles a day,  so that helps. 
[00:25:30]  Roland?  Bravo.  Bravo.  Whoa.  She wanted to know  how come there's no more  Q&A, O&As.  Well,  I think you asked that question.  Well,  you said you were wondering  and you were hurt,  so that's why I was...  Well...  We've had this conversation.  Yeah,  we would give them,  we would turn them in,  and then nobody  who ran the board  would ever play them.  You talking about the sex band?  Yeah.  So...  That didn't take a lot of hesitation.  There was nothing...  They would just sit there.  So we did all this work  and tried to put it together  and make it clever and fun 
[00:26:00]  for them to sit there  and we'd be like,  hey,  why don't you fucking play this?  So finally you'd play it,  finally.  Then we'd do another one  and there'd be another month.  And they'd only play them once and stuff?  Yeah, so we're like,  why bother?  So you kind of...  So we're going to redirect this  to the sex man.  So this is all Eric's fault?  This is the first time  I'm hearing of this.  He likes to be known  as the sex bagel on the air.  That's true, that's true.  Travis,  this may be something  that you have to  get to the bottom of  because obviously  there's a lot of conflict  going on with Eric.  I'm going to be all over  the sex man on this.  And also real quick, 
[00:26:30]  Kim was a little concerned.  She was hoping that something  wasn't going to come up on the air.  What?  Somebody has a fascination with her  or had said something  about it before.  Are you talking about  Club Soda Kenny?  Yeah.  Oh, Club Soda Kenny.  Well, I don't know.  He's happily married.  So I think he might have  just been joking around with her.  Yeah, probably.  But sometimes his jokes,  you know,  they become...  They're very abrasive.  Yeah.  And if you don't understand  his humor,  it could come across  as a little...  Is that what happened?  No, no.  I mean, you know,  it's just a little...  That's what she said behind... 
[00:27:00]  There's a lot more  beneath the surface.  But somebody that people  really don't understand  is Derek.  We talked to him earlier.  D-Boy is a person  who's just shrouded  in mystery constantly  because he doesn't  like to talk.  He sometimes does  production pieces  that are not even  really for the air.  Do you want to hear  something about D-Boy?  A fun fact?  All right.  Do you want to know  how he relaxes?  How?  He goes to my office  and he answers  the bumper sticker  request for fans 
[00:27:30]  and he smiles,  opens it,  puts it in,  closes it,  and then he  mills them out to it.  Derek,  I'll just go for a role  and Derek loves  doing wow sticker requests.  That's his relaxation technique?  So you're telling me  that for the last  several months  if you've gotten  a wow sticker in the mail,  there's a good chance  that D-Boy  packed those?  It was him.  100% of the time.  Do you have  to do that,  I would think?  No?  No.  No?  No, we don't have interns.  That's been addressed  on the air a few times.  This is D-Boy's enjoyment, 
[00:28:00]  so this is his relaxation.  But what D-Boy  also does to relax,  he makes production pieces,  as I said.  It's not for the air.  None of us know  why he's doing it  and then he doesn't  even submit them.  He just kind of  throws them in the system  and he hopes that  somebody will stumble upon it.  Two days ago  in the office,  he goes,  yeah, if you want to,  at 10 o'clock,  you can play  my Paul Reiser piece.  And we all looked at him  like,  what are you talking about?  So we had to go find it.  This is the Paul Reiser song.  Does it have a title, Travis?  Yeah, Paul Reiser Breaks  with a Z. 
[00:28:30]  It's called  Paul Reiser Breaks.  So this is it.  D-Boy's latest  production masterpiece.  It's Paul Reiser Breaks.  It's radio.  Wildly funny.  Wildly funny.  What happened?  Out of your mind.  Wildly funny.  It's radio.  It's radio.  It's radio.  Wildly funny.  Wildly funny.  This is the most energy  I've had at 7 in the morning.  Wildly funny.  Wow.  Wow.  Oh, jeez.  I've never been in a room  this funny.  Wildly funny.  Wildly funny. 
[00:29:00]  What happened?  Out of your mind.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez.  It's radio.  Wow.  Wow.  Have you ever been to the zoo?  Because that's also entertaining.  Wildly funny.  Wow.  Wow.  I've never been in a room  this funny.  Wow.  It's radio.  Wildly funny.  Radio.  Wow.  Wow.  Wildly funny.  Radio.  Wow.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez. 
[00:29:30]  He is a strange person.  He's not normal.  What were you saying, Kim?  What?  Mike's wrong.  No, I went so.  You heard it.  That's right.  Well, on that note,  we will say goodbye.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  I've got a big interview  to start the show.  As usual,  it's going to be fantastic.  Who's the interview?  I don't know.  But this has been  after Opie and Anthony Live.  We'll be back tomorrow,  as will Opie and Anthony.  Don't talk that way.  Stay tuned, Ron and Fez.  Yeah, he kind of snapped at him.  Well, I don't know who it is.  I'm trying to wrap up the show.  He just keeps yapping.  Stay tuned.  That's a good question.  Who is it? 
[00:30:00]  I don't fucking know.  But Ron and Fez will tell you  when they're coming up next.  The Opie and Anthony Show  is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O&A Show  on Facebook  at facebook.com  slash Opie and Anthony.  And catch Opie and Anthony  live Monday through Friday  from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern  on The Virus. </pre>
