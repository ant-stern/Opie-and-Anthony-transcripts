<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Opie detailing his unconventional desired funeral arrangements, including cremation and cocaine.  This transitioned into a caller's vicious verbal assault on Jimmy Norton, escalating into a profanity-laced exchange targeting each other's mothers.  Another caller then recounted catching his ex-wife and best friend in a missionary position, adding that the best friend now lives with his ex-wife and children. A comedic song about "Alabama-man" followed.  The show then delved into a discussion of Jimmy Kin's unusual childhood, including his imaginary friends (a beehived woman and a caped version of himself), his fascination with the Village People and Kiss, and disturbing experiences with urine-soaked underwear. A significant portion was dedicated to mocking Tony Danza's talk show, highlighting its perceived excessive and undeserved applause breaks, illustrated with clips showcasing the repetitive nature of Danza’s condolences.  A listener-created website mocking the show was also mentioned. A caller attempted to share a pornographic audio recording, which was cut short.  Numerous XM Radio commercials aired throughout this segment.

Next, a lengthy segment focused on the comedic dissection of Tony Danza's talk show continued.  The hosts contrasted Danza’s on-air persona with their imagined ideal talk show segments involving violence and graphic sexual situations. They referenced a website showcasing compilations of Danza's seemingly insincere moments and awkward singing.  Two listeners, Debra and Joan, were pranked with calls pretending to be Tony Danza, culminating in sexually suggestive exchanges and promises of backstage meetings involving specific actions in exchange for a large cash prize or a staged embrace on-stage. This segment also included a discussion of a meeting with an XM executive, Eric Logan, where the hosts mocked the corporate jargon and advice they received, using baseball and buckets as analogies.  Opie recounted an unpleasant encounter with whale nasal discharge during a whale-watching trip.

Following this, the show featured a prank call segment centered around Ashley and her mother, Janice. Ashley initially claimed to have slept with her father's 38-year-old best friend, Fred (who is married to Ashley’s godmother, Lisa), multiple times.  The ensuing conversation between Ashley and her furious mother, Janice, contained graphic details of their sexual encounters. The hosts questioned the story's veracity, even claiming an XM Legal representative would call to verify it.  Ashley maintained the story's truth, leading to further discussion.  A subsequent call, seemingly from Ashley and Fred, claiming they were in Ashley's parents' bedroom intending to have sex while her parents were out, abruptly ended, revealing the entire story to be a fabricated prank. The hosts acknowledged the prank's success and commented on the callers' impressive performance.

A studio guest, Erica, then joined the show, bringing a "lesbian couch." The hosts inspected the couch with a blacklight, looking for stains.  Erica gifted Opie a small dish (which he accidentally broke), beer pitchers, and a box of vintage poker chips and cards to the hosts. Opie's accidental destruction of the dish and poker chips visibly upset Erica. The hosts discussed the prank, listener feedback, and Erica's reaction.  Multiple commercial breaks were interspersed.

The final segment began with a discussion about corporate jargon, specifically the term "baked." A call from Peter, a regional sales manager, followed, expressing frustration with corporate jargon like "blue sky," "sync up," "own," and "scope creep." Opie then recounted a story from his early radio days in Buffalo, involving playing a highly profane Rolling Stones song ("Starfucker") on air, leading to a near-firing.  Master Poe, described as an "assigned assassin" and martial arts expert, then entered the studio with theme music the hosts jokingly criticized as "faggy." The segment ended with a humorous, sexually suggestive reading of a film scene containing the repeated phrase "Put the fucking lotion in the basket," followed by banter and XM radio promotions.

No.  And why are you calling the show today?  Well, I want to play call your mom, but mine is real.  Oh, you want to confess something to your mom?  Uh-huh.  I slept with my dad's best friend last night.  How old are you? 
[00:10:30]  Old enough.  How old are you?  19.  How old is your dad's best friend?  He's 38.  I'm going to whack my bag.  Is this real?  Yeah.  So how did this come about?  Well, I liked him for a while, and I just, I don't know.  We got together last night.  Is your father's friend married?  Yeah.  He's married?  Yeah.  With kids?  No, he doesn't have kids.  Got you. 
[00:11:00]  And is his wife hot?  She's all right, I guess.  And did you do, uh, did you, um, make the move, or did he?  We both did.  Both did.  So he's been coming over the house a lot?  Um, we've been meeting in a secret location.  Ooh, secret.  It's a secret.  It is.  Is it a parking lot?  No.  What kind of a location?  You don't have to give away the location.  What kind?  A hotel.  Ah, the old hotel. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  He's pulling the old Butterfuco on her.  Is this a real story?  I swear, yeah.  All right, let's get her mom on the phone, but you've got to tell the mom that she's  going to come on the radio.  All right?  Do we have your mom's number?  Yeah.  Uh, no.  I've got to give it to you.  All right, hold on.  Do it off the air or else everybody will be calling.  Hold on.  Uh-huh.  They're getting nervous in Washington.  Relax.  We've got to tell the mom that she's on the air.  We know all the laws.  Wait, get Ben in here.  Hold on.  Mm-hmm.  Just say it's a radio show, and, you know, your daughter has something cute she wants to tell 
[00:12:00]  you.  Something cute.  All right.  All right, Ben.  Uh, Janice?  Yes?  How are you?  Pretty good.  All right.  Um, are you familiar with the Opie and Anthony show?  No.  Oh, okay.  It's a cute little radio show we do.  Okay.  We're pretty, um, harmless.  Okay.  And, uh, your daughter's on the line, and she wants to tell you something.  Okay.  Hope that's where she was.  Any idea in your head what it might be? 
[00:12:30]  Hopefully where the hell she was last night.  Ah.  Why is that?  Was she missing?  Well, she was supposed to come home by, like, one o'clock, because that's her curfew.  And I've been lying to her dad all fucking night about where she's been, and, um, I'm  a little pissed.  Does, uh, does she live with you still?  Yes.  Uh, she's got a little room that she's had since, what, she was a little kid?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Set up the same way.  Stuffed animals and stuff?  Yeah, she's still stuffed animals.  And how old is she?  Nineteen.  And where was, uh, where did she say she was going last night? 
[00:13:00]  She was going out to the movies and dinner, and then she was going to be home after she  went to some club up in Wilkes-Barre.  With friends?  Did she go to the movies?  Yeah, that's what she said.  What friend?  Janine, why?  Oh, just wondering.  Uh, Janine's...  Janine's...  Janine's one of our good friends?  Yeah.  Yeah, Janine's, uh, she's a troublemaker, isn't she?  Yeah, she can be.  Would rather not hang out with Janine?  Bad Seed.  What, uh, what, uh, movie were they supposed to go see last night?  The Grudge or something like that.  Ah, a little scary movie. 
[00:13:30]  Ah, yes.  All right, uh, let's put your daughter on the line here.  Okay.  This is Ashley.  Ashley!  Yeah?  Hi, uh, we got your mom, Janice, on the phone here, and she's wondering what, uh, where  you were last night until, uh, how late there, Mom?  She never fucking came home at all.  Oh, Jesus.  You gotta be...  She's still not home.  She's still not home.  Well, maybe she's working.  Yeah, ha, yeah.  Okay.  Oh, no.  Uh, Ashley?  Yeah? 
[00:14:00]  Would you like to tell your mother where you were last night?  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Mom?  Yes?  Um, I, God promised not to get mad, and I don't want you to tell Dad what I'm gonna tell  you.  I've been lying to him all night.  What else do you want me to lie to him about?  Um...  Don't use any last names, by the way.  Okay.  I slept with Fred last night.  Fred?  Daddy's friend?  Yeah.  What are you out of your mind? 
[00:14:30]  I'm friends with...  Oh.  Mom, please don't tell Dad.  I...  I don't...  Oh, don't tell Dad.  Sure.  You tell Dad.  Oh.  And you're doing this to me on air?  Oh.  You're lucky your dad's never heard of this show.  Well, will he be in state pen by tonight, because he'll come...  What do you get all mad about?  His age, and your age, and you're my baby, and he's fucking a baby? 
[00:15:00]  Well, you're not, but you are.  You're my kid.  Well, Ashley, what happened last night?  Well, we went out to eat, and we went out to a movie, and then he took me to the hotel,  and we fooled around.  You don't have to worry about me telling your dad.  I'm going to go fucking kill him.  What's this guy like, Janice?  Well, see, I guess, um, two-faced, I would say.  Um, he's been eating dinner here. 
[00:15:30]  He's been eating dinner across the table with you since you're two years old.  Oh, my God.  I can't help it.  I'm attracted to him.  You're attracted to him.  Wait, you fooled around.  You just kissed him, right?  No, we went all the way.  Oh, you slut.  Is this the first time?  I'm not a slut.  It's my first time doing it.  What the fuck are you freaking out for?  Because he's 38 years old.  He just had his birthday.  Are you friends with this guy's wife? 
[00:16:00]  Yes, I am.  And Lisa is not going to be, oh, my God.  Lisa is your godmother.  How am I going to even try and tell her this?  Lisa, the guy's wife, is the godmother of your daughter?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  It's a very sacred position to the Sicilian people.  And, Ashley, you been fooling around with him a while or no?  I fooled around with him a couple times, yeah.  But this was the first time you went all the way last night? 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  And it was in a seedy hotel somewhere?  Yeah, it's in Hazleton.  Yeah, every hotel here is a seedy.  Mom, what are you going to do?  Are you going to tell the wife, maybe?  No.  Mom, you better not.  I don't want you to tell anybody.  I just didn't want you to tell anybody.  You take me on the radio, and you don't want me to tell anybody.  You have some nerve.  Oh, my God.  Hey, Ashley, was he good?  Uh-huh.  Ashley was.  He better damn well be, because now you are out. 
[00:17:00]  What do you mean, I'm out?  You can go live with him after he gets a divorce.  Well, fuck it.  Then I will.  Yeah, you will.  This is bullshit.  Ashley, I did not raise you like this.  What happens to college?  Are you going to still go?  Are you going to still have a life?  Or are you going to just hook up with some old man and live off of him for the rest of your freaking life?  He makes good money.  Well, you know what?  You're smarter than that, and you're being a complete moron right now. 
[00:17:30]  Complete moron.  And this is the something cute you had to tell me.  Jesus fucking Christ.  Oh, my God.  Calm down.  My blood pressure is shooting up faster than anything.  You know, you're going to put me in my fucking grave.  I'm not that old, but I'm going to be going in my fucking grave soon.  Can I ask a question?  Uh-huh.  Not to be Ashley?  Yeah.  Was he a big boy? 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  Fucking Christ.  I hope it was worth it.  That's all I got to tell you.  It better fucking have done well than worth it.  Was he cut or uncut?  He's cut.  What position did you enjoy?  I was mostly on my back.  Yeah. 
[00:18:30]  That's great.  Eating dinner over your house.  Now he's eating somewhere else.  Oh, God.  Mom, please don't tell Dad.  Yeah, like, I want to lose a husband.  Mm-hmm.  Why would you lose a husband?  Because he'll fucking kill him.  Why?  That's his best friend and his daughter.  So what's the problem?  Wouldn't you want to fucking kill him?  I mean, right now, I'm, like, getting ready to go to his job and blow his fucking head off.  Oh, boy.  That'd be the second time in two days he's had that done. 
[00:19:00]  I hear a kid in the background.  I'm not going to enjoy my way, though.  Fucking little bitch.  So did you notice there was some flirting going on there, Mom?  No.  No?  And what's going on with the kid in the background?  I have babies that are crying.  And this is your oldest?  That's my oldest.  Ashley's your oldest.  And I'm hoping, you know what?  He's never allowed in this fucking house again, because how is he going to go after my 12-year-old?  Is he going to go after my fucking 2-year-old now? 
[00:19:30]  Or what?  Maybe he'll go after your brother.  You got a little farm there for him.  Yeah, they really, it's like the Expos of pedophiles.  So what are you going to do to keep from raising another slut?  Fucking lock him up.  You home after school.  You just come home after school.  Could you quiet that baby the same way they quieted the baby at the end of Caligula?  Oh, my God.  Last episode of MASH.  I'm just going to come home and we'll talk. 
[00:20:00]  Brr, brr, brr.  You can't come home.  Wouldn't be quiet.  I've been up all night.  Not only with the baby, but walking the fucking halls, waiting for your ass to come in the store.  Well, she was getting laid.  And you're out.  You know something?  I wouldn't believe this unless it was some shithole in Pennsylvania that they were coming from.  In fact, it's Hazleton.  I know.  It's totally...  I believe this could happen there.  Yeah.  All right, Ashley.  Anything else you want to say to your mom? 
[00:20:30]  No, but I want to play with my pants.  Oh, you've got to go.  You know what?  Your bags will be at the fucking steps when you get home.  She's the...  Your mom's heartbroken.  I did not raise my child to do stuff like this.  Oh, boy.  We might live in a town where fucking people walk around and do shit that God only knows what,  but I raised you better than that.  Apparently not.  Mom, would you play a game of mother-daughter once in my pants? 
[00:21:00]  Jimmy.  Not a bad idea.  Why not?  All right, well...  Well, it looks like you guys got some things to work out there, huh?  Oh, yeah.  I'll come home and we'll talk.  Oh, yeah.  Come home.  Yeah, we'll talk.  How many times did you guys have sex last night, Ashley?  Four.  Yeah, we're going to talk.  Four?  About four.  About four times.  Not bad.  Not bad for the old guy.  Did he rub his helmet on your brown eye? 
[00:21:30]  Uh-huh.  Did he try anything, like, freaky?  No.  Like the whole situation isn't freaky enough.  No, he was nice about it.  Yeah, he was a real gentleman.  And does he like you?  I think.  All right.  Janice, you all right?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  She's just reflecting, looking at her other children, thinking, you know, who's next?  Yeah.  You're not necessarily going to fail with the other ones, too. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, I don't want to cry.  What?  I don't want to cry.  Don't cry.  You just basically told me that everything that we've been living and everything, I thought  we could trust these people, and apparently we can't.  I've known them for that long, and this is the way they're going to be.  Yeah, it's one of those things, you know, I'm sure she's upset she can't get the image  out of her head of this guy, just on top of her little girl, you know, pounding away, 
[00:22:30]  and that's an image that will probably stick with her for quite a while, both of them just  naked.  Yeah, and your descriptions are so helpful.  Get that image out of your head.  Sorry, I was just trying to convey that, you know, it's probably very upsetting to you.  All the trust, the holidays spent together, her little teenage body, just wanting and  wanting.  And a couple of years ago, you remember her like, you know, the little girl.  All right.  And now all of a sudden, she's a young woman, and this guy that you've entrusted is just  ravening her in a hotel room. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  Just fouling your daughter over and over again.  Now you're running back through your mind, thinking of all the times he was over, that  you might have thought he was looking at her a little weird.  Oh.  When she was 13, maybe?  Yeah, now I'm worried that he's looking at my other children.  Well, then dress him better.  All right, Ashley, any final thoughts there?  No, I'll be home and we can talk about it then.  Yeah, you need to come home so we can talk about it.  Yeah, and you need to come home, like, soon, okay? 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  Well, Mommy's not mad at you, not at all.  Oh, boy.  Ashley, where are you now?  I'm at the hotel.  Which hotel?  The one right down the street or by the mall?  The one by the mall.  The one by the mall.  Okay, why don't you just wait there and I'll come get you.  Oh, boy.  Ashley, are you attractive?  She's a beautiful girl.  Does she have email?  Oh.  Jimmy.  All right, Ashley. 
[00:24:00]  Janice, thank you.  Oh.  I didn't know this was going to happen today.  Ashley said she just wanted to tell you something on the show today.  Yeah.  I didn't know it was going to be this.  But we told you there was a prize attached and you actually win Dr. Spock's book on how  to be a better parent.  Yeah, I should have used it 19 years ago right across her ass.  Either that or a hanger.  Yeah.  Or how to choose better, Frit. 
[00:24:30]  Are you going to come pick me up for what?  Yeah, I'm coming to get you.  All right.  All right, we're going to need an update on this story.  So why don't you guys call us tomorrow or Thursday or something, all right?  Oh, you want to put Ashley on hold because Eric wants her number.  We're going to put Ashley on hold and Janice, we're going to put you on hold.  All right?  Okay.  We're putting you both on hold.  All right.  Put.  Shut up.  All right.  Thanks, Janice.  Oh, you're welcome.  And there they go.  Oh, that was good.  Hmm. 
[00:25:00]  Interesting.  I mean, I don't know what to make of that story.  Oh, God.  Jimmy, I have a full rod.  He is all like, how does he, how does he get a rod from that one?  Janice, just hearing mommy's tears.  Janice.  Yes.  Jim has a full rod after listening to this story.  I'm not some 38-year-old creep, though.  He's 35.  36.  36.  36-year-old creep.  And he was very turned on by your daughter's story.  How are you going to, how are you going to confront this guy?  Oh, I don't even know. 
[00:25:30]  I say just tell his fucking wife and let her freaking deal with him.  All right.  Why don't we call the wife?  Hey, do you have her number?  You want to call the wife?  Oh, I would never do that to Lisa.  I'd never do anything like that.  Why don't you call Fred?  You don't have to do it to Lisa.  Why don't you call Fred?  Oh, that's a good one.  He's at work right now.  Exactly.  Yeah, that'd be great.  Let's confront Fred at work.  Why not?  The way he used your trust just to get your little, you know,  meet me down the street at the hotel.  All right.  Take care, parents.  Meet me down the street at the hotel. 
[00:26:00]  You know what he must have been thinking when he saw that 18-year-old ass?  Yeah.  The 19-year-old ass for the first time.  Yeah, newly turned 19-year-old.  Just turned 19.  Phone rings once for the signal.  She meets him outside by the sycamore tree.  Opie and Anthony, XM202.  Oh, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Get up.  Come on, get down with the sickness.  Get up.  Come on, get down with the sickness.  Get up.  Come on, get down with the sickness.  Get up.  Come on, get down with the sickness.  Get up.  Come on, get down with the sickness. 
[00:26:30]  You mother, get up.  Come on, get down with the sickness.  You fuck out, get up.  Come on, get down with the sickness.  That this is stuck.  Get the heaven given up.  All right, we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Controversity has broken out on the O&A Show.  Ashley was on the line about 15 minutes ago claiming that she slept with her father's best friend.  She wanted to tell her mom.  We got the mom on the phone.  And very awkward phone call to listen to.  But we got to be honest, half the listeners are completely buying it,  and the other half are not buying it whatsoever. 
[00:27:00]  We're divided in here, too.  Yeah, we're kind of on the fence in here.  I don't know.  You know, I love to think it's real.  I sure would.  Right.  But I don't know.  We still have Ashley on the line, and we're going to try to get to the bottom of this.  She can't hear us right now.  And we're going to make believe, like, you know,  where someone from the legal department or something from XM Saturday Radio  wants to get to the bottom of this, okay?  Yeah.  So why don't we get her?  Yeah, okay. 
[00:27:30]  Ashley?  Yeah.  Hi.  This is Chuck Schick from XM Legal.  Hey.  How are you doing?  We need to fill out some forms regarding the content of your conversation on the air.  Okay.  And we absolutely need to know if it was true or false,  because there could be legal ramifications for the program.  So it's not for the air. 
[00:28:00]  Tara, we just want to know if this really did happen or not.  It's fine either way.  Yeah.  So you're saying this absolutely did happen.  It happened.  Okay.  And you were telling your mom for the first time.  Yeah.  Okay.  Check that.  Because, you know, we don't want to be sued.  No, I...  This side, you know.  So if it's true, we will then write down that it is indeed true. 
[00:28:30]  And if not, that's fine too.  But you're saying this absolutely did happen and your confrontation with your mother was absolutely legitimate.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, thank you very much.  Okay, thanks.  And please hold.  Janice?  Yeah?  There's your confirmation.  That's real.  Shameless husband.  Okay.  Lou.  Lou.  Right, the Ted Nights. 
[00:29:00]  Lou, Mary.  Oh, Mary had sex with Lou.  Mary at Lou.  The Ted Nights sound.  Oh, Mary.  Oh.  Marie.  Mary had sex with Lou.  All the trust that we put in Lou.  He slept with Mary.  Jesus.  Well.  Ashley, you need to be in the lobby in 15 minutes because I will be there for you.  Okay.  Just tell her there's a 38-year-old cock waiting for her and I'm sure she'll be right there. 
[00:29:30]  All right.  Well, I'm sorry to hear that this is actually true.  I can't believe this.  You guys got some talking to do.  Some healing.  And you know what, Janice?  And if you need it, we do have Jerry Springer's number.  If that'll help you guys.  I'll say I'm sorry to hear that it's true, but then there's a part of me that's glad it  is because I'd hate to think I got a fat boner for nothing.  All right, Janice.  Any final thoughts?  Because we have to move on.  Yeah.  Take care of yourselves and each other.

[00:31:00]  Everybody did.  Nobody liked it.  Everybody had it.  Nobody...  Even if you think you liked the game, you didn't.  And it's simple.  Why?  Ready?  Because this is anybody here, two and a half hours into a game of Monopoly.  Ready?  Fuck this game!  It's four in the morning, Grandma.  You win!  I'm sitting on Baltic with crack.  I'm paying luxury tax out the ass.  And I hate when you're the banker.  Where'd you get the pink 50s, you cheating whore?  Don't fucking touch me, Grandpa. 
[00:31:30]  Nana is a cheating whore!  And I should cut your head off with this little doggie.  We were so poor growing up, that little iron.  We had to actually use that little iron.  It's not funny.  It takes a long time to iron a shirt with that tiny little iron.  It's so hot.  I had that game Operation.  Remember the game Operation?  Big naked white guy. 
[00:32:00]  He had no pee-pee at all.  He had no...  No scum-diddly-umptious.  He had no cash and prizes.  He was like that guy from the movie Silence of the Lambs.  Remember he tucked it in.  Put the lotion in the basket.  Put the lotion in the basket. 
[00:32:30]  You're laughing because you've done it, you freak.  You're a freak.  You're a freak.  I used to do it.  I used to come out of my girlfriend's bathroom naked.

[00:34:30]  Okay, terrific.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  No more of that.  It's bad for you.  All right, you guys want an update on Ashley?  Ashley from yesterday who told her mom.  This was the real deal.  We weren't buying it, but then we were able to confirm that this actually happened.  Yeah.  We had Ashley call.  She's 19 years old.  She's had a crush on her father's best friend for a while.  I guess the father's best friend is her godfather too, right, or something like that? 
[00:35:00]  Well, I know that the best friend, the one that had sex with the daughter, his wife,  because he's married, is the godmother of the girl that he had sex with.  So I don't know if he's the godfather.  So basically this guy's been coming to the house since Ashley was like two or something.  And Ashley's mom and dad are good friends with this guy and his wife.  Don Corleone, it is an honor to have sex with your daughter on the day of your daughter's wedding.  I like when you put that in my mouth from your grandson, Frank. 
[00:35:30]  Can I fuck your daughter for old time's sake?  And the dick she sucked was a masculine dick.  You can act like a whore!  What's the matter with you?  So we have an update here.  Uh-huh.  Ashley decided to tell her mom live on our show.  She was the greatest piece of ass I've ever had, and I've had him all over the world. 
[00:36:00]  Wow.  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous.  What days did you have sex with him?  Tuesday, Sunday, Friday, Wednesday, Monday.  Yeah, so she decided to tell her mom live on our show.  We had the wacky bit alert happening in our heads, but it turns out it was the real deal, so we were able to confirm it.  But we have Ashley on the line to give us an update, and I hear it's not going to be a good update here. 
[00:36:30]  So once again, to the program, we go with Ashley.  Hey, Ashley!  Oh, wait a minute, Ashley.  Damn it.  Hold on.  Ashley!  Yeah.  Okay, you're there.  Hello.  What's going on?  They threw me out.  I got the shit kicked out of them.  I don't know if my mom called Lisa or not.  She said she did, but Lisa's in St. Petersburg, so... 
[00:37:00]  All right, let's back up.  Who's he?  So after the show, you went home?  Yeah.  And I heard that your stuff was all over the lawn?  No.  Huh?  No.  Oh, that's what Eric was saying.  Did you get thrown out?  Yeah, they threw me out.  And where are you staying?  I'm at the hotel now, but I think I'm just going to go stay with a couple of friends.  And what happened to the guy? 
[00:37:30]  My dad went after him.  Oh, how did he find out?  My mom told him.  She wound up telling him.  You wrecked a friendship that probably goes back 20 years.  Well...  Eh, who cares?  He got laid.  So now what are you going to do?  That's the only important thing.  What are you going to do now?  Probably stay with friends.  I don't know.  So why would you call the show and announce this to the world?  I wanted to be a little bitch, I guess.  Backfire to my face.  You wanted to be a little bitch? 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  Get back at your parents for a little something?  Yeah.  Why would you want to do that to your mom?  Did your mom do something to you?  No, she's just been ragging on me lately.  Yeah.  Yeah, when they rag on you, you've got to have sex with a family friend.  Exactly.  Boy, you really showed her.  Now you're living in a seedy hotel and with friends.  What do you look like?  I don't know.  Good looking.  I have real long brown hair, blue eyes.  I'm about 5'2". 
[00:38:30]  All right.  The important thing.  How much do you weigh?  The last time I weighed myself, I was 107.  107?  Okay.  That's good.  Very nice.  So you're not a fat girl?  No.  Because I'm not saying it's wrong to ruin a family friendship, but you just got to not  do it over a fat girl.  No, no.  Have you talked to the guy?  Yeah.  Yeah, we were together again last night.  Oh, you were, were you?  Is he footing the bill for the hotel?  Yeah.  Wait, so did your father find him? 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  And he beat him up a little bit?  Yeah, my dad gave him a pretty good beating.  And then you had sex with the guy again last night?  Yeah, we were, he said that he'd get me an apartment, but he paid for it.  I don't know.  So did you bang him after he was all beat up over there?  It's so sad.  No, my nose is running.  Oh, all right. 
[00:39:30]  And I'm trying to signal that I need the paper towels that are right in front of Ben, and  they're like looking at everything.  What do you need?  You need something for the show?  It's like...  Well, I just didn't know you're looking at Ben, and Ben's turning the page, so I thought  you wanted me to signal Ben.  I was really going to get him back.  I tried to talk him into space.  Wait.  I'm just going to blow him over the radio.  You are?  What?  You should anyway.  What do you mean you were?  How about...  He's not here.  What's that?  I'm here.  Where is he?  Having his wounds tended to?  He went back. 
[00:40:00]  He went to work.  You were going to blow him on the radio?  Mm-hmm.  This gets better and better every day.  You know, you're right.  Can we get your mom on the line while you blow you?  Oh, my God.  Blow on the radio.  What did I want to do?  I wanted to get my mom on the other line, and if my dad was still home, I wanted to  get them both on the other line.  Why do you...  And tell them that I wanted to apologize to them, and I was going to blow them over the radio  and just say, here, fuck you.  Stay nuts.  All right.  Why do you hate your parents so much?  Because they rag on me all the time.  That isn't hating your parents. 
[00:40:30]  That's just a fun little prank, Hopi.  And what kind of ragging do they do?  Go to school.  Don't dress like a slut.  Get a job.  Clean your room.  Clean your room.  Get that older man's cock out of your mouth.  What kind of ragging could they possibly do?  The normal ragging.  What?  What you guys said.  They're just constantly on my back about something.  What did...  Oh, God.  No, I have nothing.  Did Fred get beat up badly?  Huh?  Did your dad belt Fred? 
[00:41:00]  My dad got the shit out of him, yeah.  So...  But would Fred go on the phone while your dad's in the line and get a Hummer like that?  No.  He won't...  That's why Fred wouldn't stick around.  He said he wasn't going to deal with it.  Oh, he's the one that put the kibosh on that whole thing.  All right, well...  You really want to get even with your parents.  You come to New York and blow a comedian.  That will really...  I'm telling you, that will really bother them.  You know, you...  I think...  I'm going to live with you, Norm.  She wants to live with you.  I couldn't have you live with me because I like living alone, but you can certainly spend 
[00:41:30]  a couple evenings.  Okay.  Yeah, you know, we've got about 12 guys that work on the show.  I think we could kind of just rotate you around a little bit.  You know, you're ripe for a career in porn.  This is perfect.  This is like a perfect resume.  Yeah, you really are a porn star in the making.  I mean, what are you going to do for a living, eventually?  What do you want to do with your life?  Small town, Pennsylvania.  She's going to go to the big city and just start hobbing knob.  Nice.  Wait, you got her mom on the line here?  Yeah, I have her on hold. 
[00:42:00]  I mean, I have her off the air so she can't hear.  Okay.  Let's put the mom on the phone, too.  Mike is saying when was the last time...  She said the last time she weighed herself, she was 107.  When was that?  1982.  That was a little trickery she did.  She said last time I weighed myself, it was 107.  Janice.  Just a couple days.  Nah, I'm kidding.  Janice, your daughter keeps calling us every day here.  Yeah.  So, what happened after the show?  Well, I called up Lisa and I told Lisa. 
[00:42:30]  You did?  You told the wife of the guy?  Yeah.  And what did she...  How did she react?  Oh, she was furious.  She's actually getting on a plane to come home today.  Why was she in St. Petersburg?  Visiting her family.  You called her in St. Petersburg?  Yeah.  You ruined her vacation?  You couldn't tell her when she got back?  No, I don't think that's something you should wait on.  And what did she say?  She was furious.  She was furious with me, even.  Why?  What did you do?  Besides raising... 
[00:43:00]  Besides raising a slut.  Yeah, she was furious with me and she was furious with her husband and she's coming home to deal with him  and then I think she's going after my daughter.  And I guess your daughter was in the hotel again last night?  Or the motel?  Whatever?  Whatever.  I don't know where she is.  I kicked her out.  Oh, you haven't talked to her since?  No.  Now, you told your husband also?  Oh, yeah.  And what did he say?  Well, he disappeared.  He came back later and a couple hours later he had some bloody knuckles and he said he took care of it. 
[00:43:30]  Took care of it.  Did he throw his bloody gi in a dumpster?  And claimed that his dog was in a fight?  That's a dog.  I'm still freaked out over that story.  Wow.  So you haven't talked to your daughter since?  No.  What would you like to say to her?  I just can't believe that you would do something like this to me.  Yeah.  I've done my best to raise a decent family. 
[00:44:00]  Where do you think you went wrong?  Not enough discipline?  It must have been.  Maybe not enough guidance?  I don't know.  I'm there.  I stayed home every day.  I let my husband go to work.  I stayed home with the kids.  I don't know.  You were home, but were you really there?  I don't know how to tell you this, but your daughter wanted to give your husband's friend a BJ live on our show today.  Oh, my God. 
[00:44:30]  But she wanted you on the other line.  She was going to say she was going to apologize, and then she was going to start sucking and say, fuck you.  Why is she doing this to me?  Oh, Paul.  I'm not doing it to you.  I'm not doing it to myself.  Oh.  What have I done to you that you need to repay me like this?  Good question.  We wanted answered immediately.  Ragging on me?  Ragging on you?  I'm your freaking mother.  What else do you want me to do?  Oh, okay. 
[00:45:00]  You could go ahead and do that.  I don't care if you play in traffic.  Oh.  Easy with that harsh criticism.  Yeah, what kind of nagging do you do?  I expect certain things done, you know, like I don't expect to find her pile of laundry at the bottom of my steps so you know that everybody falls over it.  I don't expect her to let her makeup lay around all over the freaking house so that everyone picks up.  Or makeup.  I mean, it's not like I ask her to paint the house.  Yeah, just little chores you want her to do.  Right.  And I'd like her to be respectable, and I'd like her to get her work done, and I'd like to get her grades up. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, but that's, I'm ragging on her.  It sounds like normal mother stuff, but your daughter doesn't think it's normal, and she needs to get back at you by having sex with her father's best friend.  Wow.  So you tell her to get her, pick up her makeup and her semen-stained clothes off the floor?  I mean...  Oh.  Hey, are you using birth control, Shannon?  Whatever your name is, what is her name?  Ashley.  Ashley.  I looked up in the phone line. 
[00:46:00]  Well, for some reason, no names are typed in on the fucking phone thing.  Because the computer's down, I told you that.  The computer's also for the phones?  Yeah.  This fucking place.  Jesus Christ.  I'm calling her Bill, because I see her name Bill up on the screen.  What do I know?  How about you use your memory?  I'm in the moment.  I'm not thinking about fucking names.  I'm thinking about what I'm going to talk about.  This is one of the biggest freaking stories we've had in the first six weeks.  And with all the whores that we have on this show, have we use fake fucking names? 
[00:46:30]  Am I supposed to remember goddamn aliases?  I want to ask a question.  It's important.  I'm looking at instant feedback.  Her name's Jim D.  It's Hey, Would You Blow Me on line five.  Who do I know?  Oh, you know you fucked your mother for a nickel.  We're going to play that in a minute.  Listen, you.  Oh, you old rat bastard.  Ashley?  Yeah?  Do you like wiffle ball?  No. 
[00:47:00]  Would you be willing to come to New York?  Yeah, you want to come visit us?  Maybe.  I don't like that.  How about a yes?  I'd like to get a gander at you.  We'll put you up in a nice hotel.  Get an older gentleman to come in and have sex with you.  No?  All right, well, Ashley, what do you want to say to your mom today?  No.  I'm not going to stop doing it.  I don't care how mad you guys get, how worse it gets.  I'm not stopping.  She's loving this because she's winning. 
[00:47:30]  She's winning.  I think she's loving it because she's...  If I could talk him into doing it, I'm definitely going to blow him over the radio.  I don't give it shit what she says.  Wow, man.  Wow, she's finally getting the attention she wanted her whole life.  This is the attention.  It's good.  What's mom's name again?  Janice.  All right, Pat McGroin.  Janice.  Yes.  Are you all right?  No, I'm here. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  I think you're going to have to give up on this one.  A lot of people are suggesting cool songs we could be playing in the background, but no,  we can't.  Our computer's broken.  I thought the computer's back up.  It keeps turning on and off.  You can play Pink Floyd's mother.  Ashley, did you guys fool around after your dad spoke with Fred?  Yeah, it was about two hours afterwards.  I like this Fred.  This guy's got some gumption. 
[00:48:30]  He's got a lot of spunk, and it's all in her.  Did he have any injuries?  Wait, wait.  No, you know what?  He mailed me real good doggy style, too.  Oh, my God.  He took out his aggressions.  His dad took out on him.  He took it out on me.  I can't take this anymore.  You are so foul.  I can't believe you.  Took out the aggression.  Wow, that is really nasty.  Was he all cut up and banged up?  Yeah. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  You made him feel better, though, right?  What did he say when he was banging doggy style?  He wasn't saying anything.  Yeah.  He was moaning with pleasure and delight.  Wow.  Wow.  There's nothing to say after that, huh, Mom?  Hey, Ashley, you haven't spoken to your father, have you?  No.  No.  Where is he right now?  Is he home?  Daddy, no, he's not home.  He went to work.  He works like he has been for the past 20 years of you being alive. 
[00:49:30]  No.  He works to support that beautiful 19-year-old ass.  That's right.  Who his friend is violating.  So she can buy her whore clothes.  Oh.  That's where his hard-earned money is going to.  You know what?  You can finish paying for school yourself.  I'm not paying for that either.  You can put a roof over her head.  Go ahead.  Stop paying for college and see what I do.  I'll be really vindictive.  You know what?  I'm not paying for anything for you.  Will be?  What could she possibly do?  I'll come and fuck him right in front of me. 
[00:50:00]  What are you going to do?  Give birth on the air for me?  You know what?  I don't care anymore.  What could you more do to me?  We tried to do that bit years ago, but it didn't work out.  What else could you possibly do to me?  I'll screw you right in front of the house.  People that I didn't even know knew right away who the hell we were.  I went to the supermarket yesterday.  Oh, my God.  The people look at me.  So you're going to screw them right in front of your mom now?  Yeah.  If she quits paying for college, I'm going to be an asshole.  Going to be an asshole.  When he starts. 
[00:50:30]  You might want to give up that.  You got back about six years ago when you started.  Ooh.  Ooh.  All right.  This is getting very uncomfortable, so I don't know what to tell you, Janice.  No, I don't know.  All right.  I washed my hands of her.  Yeah.  I'm done.  All right.  And, Ashley, any final thoughts here?  No, I said if I could talk Fred into it, I'll call you back.  All right.  Oh, what a little slut.  Do you think Fred's wife is going to come and knock on the hotel doors? 
[00:51:00]  There's a whore in your hotel!  I'll bring her right to the air.  Right to the hotel.  There's a whore in your building!  That's what the police is going to do.  I'll bring her right to the hotel.  She's so furious, I hope she rips every strand of your hair out.  Mm.  No.  All right.  All right.  I guess there's the update everyone was asking for today.  It hasn't gotten much better today, right, Ann?  No.  All right.  Well, Ashley, good luck to you.  All right.  Thanks.  And, Janice, I don't know what to tell you.  What, what, Eric? 
[00:51:30]  I'll put them on hold.  Can you do that?  Place them on hold?  Yeah, put them on hold.  Shut up.  Can you do that?  Or is the computer broken?  We can place them on hold.  Place more gooder than...  How come there's no names up there for Anthony to look at?  I don't know.  It's a mess today.  All right, guys.  Thank you.  Bye.  All right.  There goes the mom.  And, Ashley, thank you.  Let's go to Patio Furniture on line three, Opie.  All right.  Wow.  That situation is getting worse. 
[00:52:00]  Son of a bitch.  That situation is getting worse, huh?  Yeah, it doesn't look very good over there.  And trust me, that's the real deal.  We know for sure.  She's a little twisted that she wants to do all this on the air.  But who are we to say no?  I want to meet her.  Instant feedback from Middletown, how she could actually get more vindictive and cause  her parents more hurt than what she's done.  She should blow a black guy on the air.  That's what our listeners are saying, not me.  I just read it. 
[00:52:30]  All right.  I do believe it's accurate.  Opie and Anthony, XM202.  Ah.  Ashley's back.  I defy the New York papers to give her the coverage you gave the white woman.  Oh, and the papers have her as the youngest girl to ever bang her father's friend.  Ashley.  Yeah.  What's going on today?  I'm in my parents' house, and I'm up in their room on their bed, and I'm going to blow  them and make them, when he's ready to come, I want them to come all over their sheets, and  then we're going to leave. 
[00:53:00]  Okay.  Hold on.  The guy is there with you?  Fred?  Yeah, it took me a while to convince him to do it, but because my parents, usually on  Fridays, my dad doesn't work, we sat across the street and waited for them to leave.  They usually go grocery shopping afterwards.  So why are you whispering if they're not in the house?  I don't know.  I guess because I'm all freaked out on doing this.  See, we're not...  I don't know if we're buying your story.  I know.  It gets bigger and bigger and worse and worse as it goes along, and it's so outrageous that 
[00:53:30]  it leaves us to believe that perhaps it isn't really happening.  Let us talk to him.  Hold on.  We don't have a cast, though.  Hey.  Yeah.  Who are you?  Fred.  What?  Fred.  Fred?  Mm-hmm.  And you're the friend of the father, and you've been having sex with this daughter.  Yeah. 
[00:54:00]  What did the father do when he found out?  He kicked shit out of me.  And how old are you?  38.  38, and you're banging your best friend's daughter.  Yeah.  And her father's 38?  I think she's pushing 40.  Mm-hmm.  And, man, I just don't know if I'd buy this.  It's so outrageous that it's like you want to believe it because it's so outrageous, but  then you kind of got to think, how can this possibly really be happening? 
[00:54:30]  Hey, Fred, if she gives you a Hummer, will you promise not the sheets?  Will you arc one on the pillow?  I don't even know if I can get it off or not.  Oh, you don't even know you can get it up?  I can get it off.  Oh, get it off.  Now, wow, what's asked this guy?  How big is it?  What?  So you've been taking her to the hotel, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And is she hot?  Yes, she's hot.  Yeah.  So you've been looking at her for many years?  I think she's about 16, I guess. 
[00:55:00]  16?  Yeah.  And how bad did he get beat up the other day?  I got a black eye, fat lip.  What did he do?  Like, how did he...  All of a sudden, you don't know what's happening, and you see the father, what, pull up?  Yeah, I didn't really think anything about it, and then he just busted in the door and  started beating the shit out of me.  So he came to your house.  Did he say anything?  Shit, like, you know, what the hell are you doing with my daughter and stuff like that.  And what did you say?  I just kind of crouched on the couch and tried to cover up the best I could. 
[00:55:30]  And took it like a man, knowing what you were going to get later on that night from  his daughter, right?  Yeah.  So you like that hot piece of ass in front of you?  Oh, yeah.  A whole lot better than my wife.  Oh, yeah, your wife.  What happened to her?  She hasn't come home yet.  Where was she?  She's in St. Petersburg.  Man, everything, like, adds up.  They got the story together.  It's so cool.  They all had their story together.  They're like a little drama club.  Anthony and I have talked about this thing that's been going on on our show for the last 
[00:56:00]  few days, and we're just not sure what's real and what's not.  Because it's so out there.  It's one of those things.  I mean, everyone's facts are kind of lining up.  They're really prepared if it isn't.  Yes, Sex Paggle.  Ask him the hotel they were talking about last time.  Is it the one down the street or the one near the mall?  Yeah.  What hotel was it at?  Was it the one down the street or the one near the mall?  It was the one up next to the mall.  Yeah, that's right.  The one next to the mall. 
[00:56:30]  Would you guys be able to come in studio someday?  I don't want to see these two.  I can't wait to see these two.  They're the greatest two ever.  I...  All right.  Well...  So, are you naked?  Is she naked?  Yes, she is, but I just got my pants down.  I don't want to take my pants off or anything.  I'm going to get out of here if anything happens.  So, why would you be talked into this?  I'm stupid.  Well, I'll give you that.  And why is...  It's Ashley, right?  Why is Ashley so upset with her parents that she would do this? 
[00:57:00]  I don't know.  You don't know?  She never talks to you about it?  Nah, just the same old teenage stuff.  You know how they are.  Yeah.  Of course we do.  Hell yeah.  Tight as a drum.  So, what is Ashley doing now?  She's working on it.  She's working on your thing?  Uh-huh.  And what does she look like?  She's...  I don't know.  Long brown hair.  Mm-hmm.  Blue eyes.  Mm-hmm.  About five...  About five, two. 
[00:57:30]  Mm-hmm.  About 110 pounds, I guess.  Uh-huh.  Aha, caught him.  What was that?  She said 108.  I heard a baby in the background.  Yeah, what am I hearing in the background, sir?  Probably TV.  TV's still playing.  All right, is she working you good?  Yeah.  Let's get the phone to Ashley.  Hey, Ashley.  Hey.  So, what are you doing? 
[00:58:00]  I'm blowing them.  In your parents' bedroom?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, shit.  There's your mom.  Okay.  All right, see, now I'm not buying it.  There it is.  They went too far.  Shit, where's your mom?  Oh, fuck!  Wait.  Okay.  Let's just listen.  Yeah.  What the fuck is...  Those corn balls. 
[00:58:30]  That was so bad.  That was so bad.  Well, here's your mom.  Then he says again, here's your mom.  There's your mom.  I don't think they heard it.  There's your mom.  I think we put an end to that story, finally.  Mr. Faber-sham.  If you want me to be involved with the play, it's out of the question.  Out of the question.  Rachel, you sucked my cock and your mom walked in.  Your mom is back.  That was awful. 
[00:59:00]  We wanted to believe it.  Yeah, but we...  Are you a sex bagel?  I just called the number back, the mom's phone number.  Yeah.  You just hear the phone come on.  You go, ow, my hair.  You...  And then it hangs up again.  So they're still playing the act out.  They're still acting.  Like, we're going to keep calling them over and over to see if this...  That's really funny.  The beautiful thing is, though, and I'll credit myself, I didn't buy this from the first...  From the get-go.  Yep.  Yep.  This is a bunch of bunk.  Bunk.  It was one of those things that sounded fun.  You wanted to believe it.  But they really, like, their little acting crew there, they had their facts lined up. 
[00:59:30]  They were good.  I didn't think it was real, either.  It was one of those things, you know, it's kind of fun to listen to them making it up.  And that was kind of funny, too.  Well, for a while there, we weren't sure.  Yeah, it was...  I was saying...  We've got to be honest.  And then we were...  And I were talking, we're like, I don't know, man.  I was saying there was a little element of doubt.  That was the only thread holding it together.  But after that, I mean, come on.  That ends it right there.  That ends it.  You know what really rubbed me the wrong way?  And I noticed this immediately, is that these two are supposedly fighting on the phone, 
[01:00:00]  and yet they tolerated every idiotic thing we said.  Right, right.  The mother, you raised a slut.  Oh, a slut.  I raised a slut, Mary.  Right now, what they're doing, they're all clasping hands and bowing.  Thank you.  Well, now they have to call back and tell us what that was all about.  Yeah, just call back.  We got the goof call back.  Yeah, we know you're kidding.  It was fun.  It was fun.  They put on a nice little show.  It was like watching a mini-series. 
[01:00:30]  It was a good three-day soap opera.  A vignette.  And you know what?  If you poll the audience, I think over 50% were buying this whole thing until today.  Yeah, that was just awful.  That was a huge discussion on a lot of the message boards.  You guys are tools.  Why are we tools?  Why are we tools, stupid asses?  I've ever seen donkey sausage.  Why are we tools?  We said just before we went to the phone call or continue with the phone call that we weren't  sure we were buying it completely. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  Look at this guy.  Too bad Dad didn't show up.  Yeah, that would have been hot.  Him and Fred could have got into it.  Damn, you think they could have at least gotten into the BJ a little more?  That didn't sound as fake.  Yeah.  Listener theater of the mind equals awful radio.  If no one thought it was real, how did you confirm that this was a real story yesterday?  Good point.  Good point.  I think someone on this program did confirm it was a real story. 
[01:01:30]  Someone did say they confirmed it and it's a real story.  I think he's got frosted hair.  Was it Sex Bagel that was confirming that this was real?  I think it was.  Well, we tried to confirm it by acting like a lawyer and stuff.  Yeah, but they weren't going to fess up to anybody.  I'll bet you they were saying, did you believe that idiot acted like a lawyer and he thinks  we bought it?  Oh, yes, for legal ramifications.  We knew you weren't a real lawyer.  Anthony didn't know any real legal terms.  Look, technically there can be jail.  Jail? 
[01:02:00]  Well, Sex Bagel's working on him.  Technicalically.  Sex Bagel, I think, is working on him right now.  Not only that, the name of the lawyer that I used was Chuck Schick, who was the lawyer  in the law student in Caddyshack, that walked up, introduced you to, hey, I'd like you to  meet Chuck Schick.  He's going to law school.  That's zero.  Chuck Schick.  That's good.  I'll say.  Nick Cage's performance in Windtalkers was better than that awful acting.  Yeah, that was horrendous acting.  Oh, it's your mom. 
[01:02:30]  Nothing.  It's your mom.  Yeah, I know.  Just perfect timing.  It's your mom.  No.  It's your mom.  When I give you the signal, we're going to yell, it's your mom.  Ugh.  All right.  Oh, I got it.  Let's call up, and we'll say that mom walked in.  You know, that's been bothering me for the last few days, so I'm glad there's an ending  to that.  But, God, I tell you one thing.  The only thing he almost tripped up what color her hair was, blonde, brown.  Blonde, brown.  Blonde, brown.  She was probably shaking her hair in front of him.  No, I mean, she couldn't have been. 
[01:03:00]  I bet you they wrote stuff down, because she got the ages right, everything right.  The hotel location.  Everything.  All right.  I think Ashley's back on the line here.  She's laughing.  Ashley.  Yeah.  All right.  You guys got to, like, fess up now, because we're on to you.  Okay.  You remember.  You remember on your screen.  Look at them.  They're all little troupes.  Look at this.  It's a comedy.  It's a comedy troupe. 
[01:03:30]  We're an improv group.  It's the Upright Citizens Brigade, everybody.  Do you remember on your second show, the second week of your show on Monday, a girl from Tennessee  called and played with herself with that high-voltage vibrator, because I had dirty dreams about  you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I'm Nina from Tennessee.  Oh, okay.  And you actually emailed me a couple times, right?  Well, how about I drove to Hazleton so that Janice's number would register on your phone  line?  Are you crazy?  No, what, you could just forward it? 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, we just totally wanted to mess with you guys.  We were giving you a little bit of your positive women's promo.  You guys had a problem with the promo.  All right, let's back up.  So you were the one from Tennessee that played with yourself, right?  Right.  So was that for real?  Yeah, that was for real.  So you had a real orgasm on our show?  Yes.  Okay.  All right, so then you guys...  This is just totally because we just wanted to give you a little bit of women's positive  promo.  Yeah, that's positive, all right.  All right, so Ashley, how old are you? 
[01:04:30]  I told you, I'm 32.  You're 32 and you're acting like a teenager?  Yeah, yeah.  And how about Janice, my mother?  Is 31.  Is 31.  The mom.  Oh, no, no, I can't believe she's...  Hey, did you write stuff down?  No, I swear to God, we didn't write a nothing down.  Nothing down, all improv.  Yeah, all improv, and we did it over the phone.  I was calling you guys from my Tennessee number, and when you guys were calling her, it was  from her Pennsylvania number, and we were just communicating back and forth by phone, 
[01:05:00]  and then Fred was actually my husband that you were talking to.  Yeah, Fred ruined it.  I was just going to do true or false.  Yeah, Fred's acting stunk.  They want to try and trap you, so they don't ever give you true or false.  I got to tell you, you know, there was a point I was believing it for a while.  Well, I think there was a point Anthony was for a little bit.  I'm always completely skeptical, so there was that element of doubt the whole time, and  I'm always fishing around trying to find out.  I wanted to believe it.  Oh, hell yeah.  And then I got to tell you, the listeners, they're being honest on the instant feedback, 
[01:05:30]  and it's split right down the middle, right?  It was always split 50-50.  Wow, so we love your show, and the shit that you say about women isn't bad.  I mean, hell, we think it's funny.  Hey, what did you think of Anthony's lawyer impression?  I knew it was a crock of shit.  Of course you did.  Damn it.  Yeah, I played right into it.  Stupid Chuck Schick.  Yeah, Chuck ruined the program.  I'm going to give you to Janice.  She wants to talk to you for a couple minutes.  I love you guys.  Norton, you're a sweetheart, and I'll talk to you later. 
[01:06:00]  Okay, thank you, miss.  Hello?  This is Mom.  Hey, Janice.  How are you?  Good.  How are you?  You guys were pretty good, I got to tell you.  Were we?  The first few days, we kind of wanted to go over the top today so that everybody really  knew.  Yeah, there you go.  No, you're saying that now because it went horribly wrong.  The timing was awful.  Oh, well, we didn't, like we said, we didn't have anything planned.  But it was, you know, three days of fun, you know?  Yeah, well, we just figured, you know, maybe you can get something you could use for a positive 
[01:06:30]  promo.  That was great.  We enjoyed that.  As far as you're not having women listeners, you obviously know you do.  Well, can you guys make it up to us now and dyke out or something?  Dyke out, Opie.  Or have Ashley get banged live on the show.  I think you've got to make it up to us now.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, we'll have to do that.  All right.  You know what was a little confusing for me?  We played a Hi, Mom, I'm in Jail, our old CD.  Oh, no, that CD never came out.  That's right.  Well, it's out there, though, and thousands of people are enjoying it, thanks to file sharing 
[01:07:00]  and oavirus.com.  But then she, you know, Ashley called up, decided this is my opportunity, and said, I want to  do one of those.  And that's when I was like, well, if it was something planned, you know, the timing, you  know what I mean?  I know.  Yeah, yeah.  The timing was too good.  Yeah, well, we tried to make it sound a little more real, but, you know, we're not professional,  so.  You guys at least made it seem professional.  That Fred, that's the worst acting I've ever heard.  I know.  Fred was horrible. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah, we hated Fred.  He made Voss seem like John Gielgud.  Wow, nice.  Good reference.  All right, guys.  Okay, but we love you, and we're going to continue listening to you.  We think you guys rock.  Thank you.  Okay.  Stay away from the pranks, or people are going to start thinking we're doing fake radio.  Okay, no, no, no, no.  And tell Ashley she's got a bang now, live on the show.  Okay, we will.  All right.  Okay.  Oh.  There it is.  Oh, you're going to get it.  Hey, dude, let me tell you, these chicks were real. 
[01:08:00]  Hey, it's Rockhole.  What's going on?  Me and Dave are calling these chicks again.  Ugh.  Yeah, all right.  That was fun.  We fessed up to it.  Cool.  It was fun to listen to for a little while.  Learn to play poker with the Opie and Anthony Show.  No.  Oh, God.  I spilled my chips.  I'm sorry, sir.  Oh, Opie.  Oh, my God.  I'll bring a little. 
[01:08:30]  Now, clean it out.  That's right.  Be a poker player, just like your father.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Are you happy now, Opie?  Are you happy?

Hi, this is Tom Torbjornson with America's Car Show, tip of the day, on XM Radio.  Last year, I got a wonderful book from my daughter.  It was The Pictorial History of the Muscle Car.  A book about cars is a great gift for that car nut.  More recently, I got an autographed copy of Brock Yates' most recent book on the history of formula racing. 
[01:11:00]  Boy, if you can get a book autographed by the author, that's a great gift for someone that loves cars.  I have a friend that loved NASCAR racing.  One year, his wife went to a race and got him a discarded tire from his favorite racing team.  Now, that's dedication.  An auto accessory such as running boards or a stereo, a set of wheels or dubs as they're referred to,  or maybe a new car is always nice, too.  You know, lately, it's en vogue to wrap their favorite car in a giant red bow and hand them the keys on that special morning.

[01:12:00]  Well, we got Erica in the studio.  Hello.  It's Couch Lady.  Hi.  How are you?  Hello.  So what's the deal?  You were supposed to be here last week with the couch?  Yes, and unfortunately, I had a little incident.  Incident?  Oh.  Infection?  No.  In what?  I don't know.  I guess I had anxiety last week.  Oh, you had an anxiety attack?  I had an anxiety attack.  Is that why our porn stars had to have lesbian sex on a piece of fiberglass? 
[01:12:30]  Is that what it was?  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  That's all right.  So I was going to wake up really early in the morning and turn around.  But are you the same girl that was just sitting out there?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was just wondering.  Because there's other girls that have been walking through.  I guess he was a little confused.  There's another girl sitting next to me that's blonde.  Oh, okay.  I told you there's a bunch of people out there now.  Oh.  I get you.  Yeah.  What's your name?  Erica.  Erica.  So you own a furniture store?  Well, we had an antique consignment shop for furnishings, and we have a bunch of stuff 
[01:13:00]  that we had.  But you were the same girl sitting right there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I told you.  Huh.  Are you married?  No.  Oh, nice.  I don't know.  Getting married.  Oh, not nice.  Did you tell us more about the furniture store?  It's closed.  I thought it would make a good addition to the book guy we just listened to.  No, it's.  Why did it close down?  Economy's not good.  No.  And you oversleep a lot?  Pretty much going down the crapper, so.  Yeah.  And I what?  And you oversleep a lot.  I heard you had a problem last week. 
[01:13:30]  He gave me something for anxiety.  Hey, come get back on mic.  Knocked me out cold, and I just did not wake up.  Really?  Wait, who gave you this medicine?  My doctor.  Right.  And so you had some anxiety, and he gave you something?  Yeah.  To make you sleep?  Yeah, he goes, here, take one of these.  I'm like, okay.  What were you anxious about?  I don't, I, well, it was things and.  Yeah?  Just.  Just things.  Whatever, and I took one and knocked me out cold for like 12 hours straight, and I.  Same girl, huh?  It worked.  You weren't anxious for 12 hours.  Yeah, exactly.  There's something about this glass.  Kind of works, is what I'm thinking. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, the couch is fine.  Oh, here comes the lesbian couch that Erica brought in.  We're having a ceremony.  Johnny, do we have any, you know, music that we could play?  We should have thought ahead of time.  Lesbian couch music, Opie.  Little Katie Lang.  What, do you want a polka?  I think there's like a heart filter on that glass or something.  I'm going to wait.  A what?  Like, you know, in the heart videos.  Oh.  All right, where's the couch?  Very nice.  Jim's on the lesbian couch.  You bet I am.  You want to explain what the lesbian couch is for the people at home? 
[01:14:30]  You're the expert on couches.  It's just a love seat, probably from the 80s.  Yes, it is a love seat.  From the late 80s.  Late 80s?  Probably late 80s.  Only the best for your pals Opie and Anthony.  Early, I don't know exactly what year.  Any stains on it?  No, it's clean.  It's clean?  Where was it all this time?  Yeah, where was it for 20 years?  Come on, tell the truth.  If it doesn't sell in the store after so long, we take ownership of it and it's out in the  warehouse for a little while.  It goes to the warehouse for half place. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, we got...  If it doesn't sell...  We got the blacklight.  We're going to make sure this is a...  Ooh.  Well, you need an extension cord, guys.  I don't think it's going to reach...  Sorry, not as good as through the mirror, Opie?  Is that what you're trying to say?  No, I didn't say that, really?  Yeah, you're trying to say it.  You can say it.  I don't know.  Like, you just looked different when you were sitting out there.  That's all.  What are you saying?  She's lovely.  I know she's lovely.  Stop trying to cause trouble.  Norton's causing trouble.  I'm not at all.  I'm trying to sit on the couch and look at her hiney.  You have a nice hiney.  Oh.  She goes, oh. 
[01:15:30]  Do you have an extension cord?  Are we going to check it with the blacklight?  Yeah, we're going to check it with the blacklight.  All right, we're plugging in the blacklight.  We want to see if anybody's been having any hanky-panky.  Who owned it prior to...  I have no idea.  Oh, yeah, no idea.  Homicide committed on this couch.  All right.  I could only dream.  Turn off the lights.  Ooh.  This will definitely make this more gooder.  She's light out.  We have to get some curtains, by the way, for them stupid...  We don't have the blacklight.  Meh, it's curtains for you.  I asked you guys what you wanted.  I could have brought curtains.  No, that's... 
[01:16:00]  The couch is fine.  Yeah, the couch is fine.  A post-1981 couch?  I have no idea what year it's from.  It does look kind of 80s.  All right, let's turn on the blacklight.  Here we go.  Yeah, but you know what?  It's going to...  You're not going to...  It's fine.  It'll serve the purpose.  Yeah, for a bunch of dykes.  Don't blacklight the girl.  Blacklight the couch.  Oh, boy.  Can you turn it on?  What are you doing?  Why doesn't anything work on this show, ever?  Danny.  Danny!  Danny!  Danny!  Danny, get that blacklight working.  That's the important thing. 
[01:16:30]  All right, now we're trying to figure out how to turn on the blacklight.  Come over here.  I'll fill out your card.  Wow, this show is just going downhill in a hurry.  No!  We can't figure out the blacklight.  It's fine.  Danny, what's wrong with the blacklight?  I don't know.  It's not turning on.  Danny.  Danny?  Sorry.  Calm down.  It'll be okay.  I tested it before I brought it in to make sure that it worked before I brought it here.  Perhaps the extension cord is bad.  It's been laying in the booth.  Plug it directly into the wall and see if it works.  Perhaps the socket is bad.  There you go.  There's plenty of things that...  All right, we got the blacklight on. 
[01:17:00]  It's the extension cord.  It's the extension cord.  Everyone calm down.  All right, pull the couch over and give it a once-over.  How do you know if there's a load on there?  What do you see?  You'll see white.  Oh, my God.  Is that X-Files music?  Very good.  All right, we're checking the lesbian couch for splooge marks.  So far, so good, right?  Anything?  We're getting a thumbs up.  Oh, they're pointing out something, Steve?  Eric?  Jim?  Yeah.  And on the armrest would be where you would bend a girl over and bang her.  All right, Steve.  What are you seeing?  Big white stain right on me.  Get out of here.  Let me see.  Armrest. 
[01:17:30]  I'm not lying.  Take a look.  Uh-oh.  What does it look like, Mulder?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  You would absolutely use that part of the couch, too.  You would bend her over that.  That's a definite load right there, a dried-up load.  That light detects semen.  Oh, there's another one.  There's something going on over there where your upper back would rest on the back of the  couch there, Anthony.  All right.  What is that?  Is that urine?  Oh, that's just the design.  No, what is that?  Is that the pattern of the couch? 
[01:18:00]  It is now.  All right.  That's what...  I don't know, man.  Is that the pattern of the couch, or is this just splattered?  Sploge stain.  Sploge.  Oh, what about that stain?  That's the pattern.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  All right.  I see the pattern.  The pattern is called jizz stain.  It was very popular in the early 80s.  Oh, there's another one.  Oh, is that a big stain right there?  What do you think?  Wait a minute.  Maybe that's just the pattern, too.  I think we have a relatively clean lesbian couch, Anthony. 
[01:18:30]  I think so, too.  There's one or two spots on it, but...  Well, I don't know.  Let's go back to the stain on the right armrest.  There's leaves in it?  There's leaves in the couch, Anthony.  Yes.  I aired it out yesterday.  What?  What?  I aired it out yesterday on the leaves.  Outside and leaves fell?  Yeah.  All right.  She aired it out.  Thanks.  Wow.  Look at that.  A condom.  No.  Ugh.  All right.  I think we're pretty clean, though.  It's clean for the thousand young couches.  Let's go back to this stain over here.  I think this might be just part of the patent. 
[01:19:00]  No, that's a stain.  Okay.  Yeah, that's a stain.  We definitely have one stain in it.  All right.  Well, hopefully tomorrow we'll get a bunch more stains on that thing.  Okay.  Sorry, Jimmy.  You won't be here.  Ugh.  That was nice.  I like that.  The lights were out.  The X-Files music playing.  Yeah, I like the lights out.  The weird black light on like they're investigating something.  Very nice.  That was good.  Well, guys, the show became more gooder today.  We now have our lesbian couch back.  Yeah.  Too bad there's no lesbians here to use it.  I know.  Tomorrow.  Yeah, tomorrow we're going to do it.  Maybe they can't make it tomorrow.  The dikes will come out tomorrow. 
[01:19:30]  All right.  Well, I hope you appreciate it.  Very much.  Use it often.  So when are you getting married?  I was supposed to get married this month.  But what happened?  Uh-oh.  Why?  Why?  Uh-oh.  Because of the store closing and other stuff.  So we decided to push it off to the summer.  What was the other stuff?  Did he bring it up to you?  Oh, no.  It had nothing to do with Ben.  No?  He didn't bring it up to you and say, perhaps, you know, the store closing, we should push 
[01:20:00]  this off?  Yeah.  Guys tend to really want to postpone those things.  Who's Ben?  I still be my fiance.  Oh, I'm thinking of Ben Sparks here.  Fiance.  Our own producer.  So maybe he whipped out that big, delicious treat.  It's not a big deal.  No?  No.  It's one of those take it or leave it, married or not married things?  Well, whatever.  It will happen.  Isn't it kind of an important thing, though?  It is.  You should be kind of excited about that, no?  You know, yeah, you are.  But, you know, you can't dwell on it if it happens.  You know, you've got to post it.  If it happens, it happens.  If it happens, you know.  This is a story here. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  What's the story?  Come on.  How long have you dated Ben?  I have been dating Ben for a little over three years.  Okay.  Ooh.  His mom owns the store.  You know.  Uh-oh.  The mom doesn't like you.  Oh, no.  No?  She's in New York.  Oh.  She's cool.  It's just that the economy went down the shitter.  No, it didn't.  People don't want to buy stuff that's used.  Listen to Bush.  It didn't.  It's got leaves on it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They want to buy new stuff and not pay two years and no interest, you know. 
[01:21:00]  So they don't want to go spend their money.  Because it's used furniture.  Because it's a consignment shop.  Exactly.  It's all used stuff.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  People kind of want new furniture.  Yeah.  They want their furniture without sploge stains on it.  Right.  They want clean furniture.  They want to shop at Siemens, not have furniture with semen on it.  Exactly.  Right.  God forbid they want clean stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Do you have sales on Tuesday?  Starting at noon.  We're selling the best used furniture with the biggest sploge stains this Tuesday night. 
[01:21:30]  Come in for our sploge stains spectacular at sploge stains.  No, of course it's not named sploge stains.  Your store wasn't named sploge stains, was it?  No.  And I'm not going to say the name of the store.  Okay.  No.  So now things with Ben, you kind of, you want to get married, but.  Oh, yeah.  We're totally going to get married.  We're now changing the entire concept of the wedding.  We were going to do that typical, you know, big reception and the one sits down for dinner 
[01:22:00]  and the photographer and the limo, you know, that whole.  You're going to tame it down?  The whole wedding.  Now it's going to be.  Just get a tent in the backyard.  No, that's what we're doing.  We're going.  Money was an issue.  I'm not going to lie.  Okay.  Money was a total issue.  So.  Well, it sounds like it.  Just a tent with a bunch of load-stained couches.  Yeah.  Instead of spending 30 grand, we're going to cut it back probably to 10.  Fine.  So.  Wow.  We'll just have a big, fat party this summer.  All right.  Sort of sounds like you're going through a tough time.  No.  I mean, not necessarily. 
[01:22:30]  No?  I'm getting through it.  I'm fine.  Well, it sounds like the anxiety and the furniture store closing and the marriage having to be postponed and scaled back.  I'm a mess.  Fine.  Yeah.  It does sound like, you know, it's a little bit of stress in your life.  And I'm glad you could take time out from your stressful life and bring us a lesbian couch.  So I had all the time in the world.  There are other ways to earn money.  Jimmy will show you.  At the nasty hotel I stayed at last night next door.  Oh, did you stay in the city?  I stayed next door.  How did you get the couch here? 
[01:23:00]  In your car?  In a minivan.  In a minivan.  Which hotel did you stay at?  The one to the.  Is it the one Opie used to stay at?  Similar.  Oh, yeah?  What's it called?  I don't know.  You tell us.  The one right here to the right of the building.  Oh, yeah.  I didn't even know there was a hotel there.  The Salisbury Hotel.  Isn't that awful?  Isn't that a homeless hotel?  I walked in going, ooh.  I think that's a flop house.  It's like a flop house or something.  I thought it was classy.  No.  So not.  Lit Park and Meridian is right across the street.  And then we walked in.  And that's a wonderful hotel. 
[01:23:30]  I love it.  Why didn't you stay at the old Park and Meridian?  I didn't even know it was there.  Because business is bad.  No, not necessarily.  I don't really care.  Couldn't afford it, Jim.  Okay?  Thanks for rubbing it in.  I wouldn't stay there.  For four hours?  I mean, I got to bed at midnight.  She can't afford her wedding, and you spent $30,000 a year on hookers.  Why'd you get up in the morning?  Why'd you?  I didn't know what time necessarily you guys could take it in, so I just decided to come.  We were trying to sleep after the anxiety medication and thinking about the business going down and sleeping in the hotel with the red neon light blinking through the window. 
[01:24:00]  Actually, no, I fell right to sleep, and then I got up and showered and came over here to see you guys.  Wasn't that big a deal?  No.  I'm sorry.  I got nothing.  I'm a mess.  Trying to sleep, and this is outside.  What?  What?  I just want to drop the couch off.  I don't know.  I'm glad I brought it to you guys.  No, you kidding?  No, we're happy.  You kidding me?  Oh, no, I'm glad.  That's better than the last one we had. 
[01:24:30]  It was a little road trip for me to take, you know?  Yeah, no, awesome.  We'll give you some prizes.  Yeah.  I actually have prizes for you guys.  What do you have?  What do you have?  I brought some other stuff for you.  What?  What gifts?  Do you like me to get it?  Sure would.  Yeah.  No, not donkey sausage kind of thing.  No, no, no.  No, follow Ben out the door.  Thank you, sausage.  And get the other stuff.  What kind of gifts?  I don't know.  It's just little stuff.  All right, yeah, go get the gifts.  Yeah.  I'd like a gift.  Lock the door.  Lock the door. 
[01:25:00]  Lock the door.  Opioids on outside.  Oh.  No, I want to.  Audio is on outside.  She's coming back in with her gifts.  All right.  Shut up, Ben.  Jesus.  Ben's giggling like a nut out there.  Bring her in.  Bring her in.  I didn't know what you were doing.  Bring the lady in with the gifts.  Jesus.  Bring in the present lady.  I'll hear the replay.  Talk anything you want to know me.  I really don't care.  That's what sucks about this show.  Don't.  Stupid replay.  Stupid replay.  Doesn't offend me.  No.  All right.  We like you, actually.  Yeah.  What kind of gifts? 
[01:25:30]  What do we got?  It's a magazine.  A sink magazine that we're in?  A sign gift.  That we have?  Huh?  You want us to sign stuff?  That's a gift.  And what's with the pink hat?  Pink hat?  Is that a gift?  Is that yours?  Steve, we got a gift.  No, like I said, the store's closed and, you know, I listen all the time.  So, you know, I heard a couple different things.  Oh, boy.  I went to the store and grabbed some stuff just for...  All righty.  Let's grab you guys.  All right.  Let's see what she's got for everybody. 
[01:26:00]  What do I have?  Well, considering Opie has nothing to entertain with, I grabbed something.  Uh-oh.  Oh, it's not bad.  What is it?  Is it one of those things that's used for jacking off, like, in 10 to midnight?  No, it's just a simple little dish that he can just throw on the table.  Oh, and, like, chips can go in there?  Oh, wow.  This is like a housewarming.  Hey, you haven't got a housewarming gift yet, have you?  Oh, boy.  Okay, so you gave Opie something that is breakable.  It's gay.  I really, you know, it's just grab some stuff.  We all get our gifts.  Why would you give Opie something that he could perhaps accidentally drop? 
[01:26:30]  You could have washed it before he gave it to me.  Jesus, this leftover dip in the dip part.  Check the price tag on the back.  She spent $13.50 on me.  Thank you.  And then I got two beer pitchers for you guys in case.  Oh, we might need pitchers.  That's true.  Hey, I just grabbed some stuff.  Don't wait.  I don't understand.  Don't be defensive.  You're bringing us gifts, and we appreciate them.  I'm going to smash this. 
[01:27:00]  No.  He is the worst.  What?  I didn't say anything.  Wow, now that's a nice pitcher.  It is a nice pitcher.  Is it glass?  No, it's that hard plastic, right?  It's plastic.  Those are good to drink a lot of beer out of if you're starring in Young Frankenstein.  I thought it was glass.  All right, what's that?  What do you got over there?  Looks like a Claymore mine.  What is that?  Oh, I think it's poker chips?  Poker chips?  From the 1940s.  It's poker chips that Al Capone used. 
[01:27:30]  She obviously stopped at a garage sale on the way down to the air.  It looks like poker chips in a hat box.  Oh, they're in a hat box.  Wow.  Wow.  I got some, uh...  I don't know.  You got any cards with those chips?  Yes.  Oh, let's have a little hand just for fun.  I could sit here now and shuffle chips with one hand.  Wow.  Like they do on the World Series of Poker.  That's just wonderful.  This is good.  I'll bet there's a gift for Jim Norton in there. 
[01:28:00]  This probably sat on top of a 60s-style folding poker table for years.  I hate my gift.  What is that?  I fear it's a joke because they were ranking on you.  You had nothing.  What is, uh...  What's that?  My gift stinks.  Oh, wow.  Oh, they're playing cards from the Moshe Suck Valley Railroad Company.  What the fuck is this? 
[01:28:30]  Wow, I guess there must be some more gifts in there.  Now that's it.  No?  Wait, you got a beer pitcher for Jim?  I just grabbed them for all of you to use.  But what about Jim?  It's for everybody.  But that's not fair.  No, these are for everybody.  It's not necessarily, I mean...  But I don't drink alcohol.  Exactly.  Could someone open the window?  I'll take it back.  All right.  Name of the game is Texas Hold'em, boys.  Ooh, you got chips and everything.  Yeah, that would be great if they weren't...  That pack wasn't missing aces. 
[01:29:00]  Card with little cards.  Are there 52 in there?  I don't think there's 52 cards there.  Oh, this is...  You should have never brought these in as a donkey sausage.  At least the other pack of cards is still wrapped.  Yeah.  Yeah, I got one wrapped, one unwrapped.  Would you gamble at the bus station on the way here?  Yes, I do.  And then this pack, because there's four decks of cards, both of these are still wrapped.  Atta boy.  I'd love to know where these came from.  No idea.  Where'd you get them?  The store.  What store? 
[01:29:30]  Her store.  Someone probably bought them in.  I can't imagine why the store is going under.  I just can't fathom.  With little tidbits like this?  Little trinkets and knickknacks?  Yeah, you might need better stuff in your store.  Maybe that's what it is.  Wow.  You were selling this?  There's plenty of stuff in there that was very nice.  I bet.  Only the best for your pals, huh?  You can throw it out the window.  Stop looking around.  I know him. 
[01:30:00]  You break it.  I'd be happy if you broke it.  I'm just trying to figure out where I could break it.  This place is so nice and new.  No, no.  This state-of-the-art studio that we're in.  It's a bit.  Opie doesn't really break things.  That's a gang from XM Satellite built for us.  Opie doesn't really break things.  It's a joke.  I never broke a thing in my life.  It's a bit.  Oh, the cards have little trains on them.  Yeah, a little choo-choo.  Choo-choo.  Well, if you haven't broken anything yet, you might as well because it could be the first  thing you break in the studio.  You broke your mouth, but that could be the second thing.  That's a good gift.  You could have people over. 
[01:30:30]  You could put the dip in the one thing and the chips in the surrounding dish.  Well, Martha Stewart.  This is a very good suggestion.  All right.  Well, this is lovely.  Thank you.  I'm done.  There's your couch.  All right.  Thank you for the couch and the gifts and everything.  You're welcome.  Why do you look so dejected?  Yeah.  I'm very happy.  I play cards and now I have chips and two choo-choo-chang cards.  Two packs of cards and a felt case. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah, the case is felt with some gold leaf trim on the side.  That's right.  It's like an old velour shirt I had when I was eight.  Can I see those pictures?  Yeah.  I promise you're not going to break it.  Don't break anything, Opie.  No, I need the other one, too.  That's not bad.  Oh, I can't break this.  No, why would you?  It's glass.  It is glass, right?  They're both real glass?  Yeah, people will.  I was ready to shower to that.  No, I wasn't.  I'm kidding.  No.  All right, Ben.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Enjoy. 
[01:31:30]  We got the lesbian couch, which we will use tomorrow.  Opie got a nice gift and Anthony got a nice gift and I don't drink, but I have beer pictures  that I can share with the group.  You can put some soda pop in it.  You don't watch the New York Times, do you?  Oh.  You can put some soda pop in it.  Maybe I can have a Coke.  All right.  Thank you.  Oh, you're welcome, guys.  Okay.  Have a good one.  Thank you.  We have to take our picture, don't we?  Well, I'm done.  Okay.  Yeah, we'll do that.  Wait, wait, wait.  Yeah.  No, Opie, don't. 
[01:32:00]  Don't.  You're going to go right through that window.  It's going to go through the control room window.  No, Opie, oh my God, no.  Opie, don't.  Don't do it.  She's still in there.  Oh my God.  No.  See, you put dip in that.  Put dip in it.  And then you put the chips around there.  It's not even washed out.  It's nice.  And you can...  Look at the remnants from the dip.  What's the going away party?  Great party, isn't it? 
[01:32:30]  When you have your little party on Sunday for football?  Yeah.  Why is this place so nice?  There's nothing to break in on.  Nah, don't drop it on the floor.  Opie, Opie, Opie.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  He just gave Jaime a heart attack.  Oh my God.  Oh, Opie.  Oh my God.  You threw it.  Oh my God.  It's broken all over the floor.  Now you just separated. 
[01:33:00]  You can put the dip in that dish.  All right, I'm not even looking out the window.  I can't even look at her face now.  Why?  Because she gave you something and you fucking broke it.  I didn't think it would break that easily.  It's ceramic.  It's rare when you throw ceramic on a hard floor that it breaks.  I could see where you'd be confused.  Oh my God.  You are the worst human.  She's ready for her picture with you, Opie.  I can't even look at her face.  No.  Why?  Oh God. 
[01:33:30]  Not even smiling at all.  I can't believe you.  I cannot believe you.  You can fix that.  A little glue.  Opie, look out the window.  Look out the window.  She's going to cry.  I'm sorry.  Is she smiling?  You can put this right back together.  This is not even that much damage.  You know?  All right.  Well.  Oof.  All right.  Well.  Let's get out of this uncomfortable situation, please. 
[01:34:00]  She's really hurt.  Opie and Anthony.  XM 202.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Norton was just lying on the lesbian couch.  It stinks, huh?  It's fine.  It smells moldy.  I'm just tired.  I don't care.  All right.  Well, I like the lesbian couch.  Thumbs up to the lesbian couch.  It'll smell like...  It has only one splooge stain, so that's good.  That'll change.  You're trying to give her a thumbs up through the window. 
[01:34:30]  Did you notice that?  How revolting was that?  Thumbs up.  And she did...  I'm with you.  She's just staring into space.  She's not even looking at you.  No.  She's not trying to make up for smashing her gift.  I just kind of tossed it to the side, and then it's shattered.  I don't know.  It's ceramic, and you broke it on purpose, and you giggled.  You're an awful person.  All right.  Well.  And Anne's doing nothing but trashing those awful 1951 poker chips.  Yeah.  See, that's the difference, though, man.  Why?  Why don't you say what you were saying during the commercial break?  How much I hate your poker chips.  I said...  And wish I had balls like me.  That these days... 
[01:35:00]  Those chips stink.  Nowadays, you can get chips that...  The same chips you play with in Vegas.  You know who uses chips like that?  Third graders.  Yeah, these chips are...  They need a little weight.  They don't have any weight to them.  They need some weight.  These are the plastic chips you used to play with with, like, your junior high buddies.  They're awful.  You'd steal them from your parents and play poker.  They are awful plastic chips.  Give her the chips back.  Yeah, you gotta give them back.  Just tell her you don't want them.  You might have to, Ant. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, Bray's a good point.  Tell her you don't want her stupid chips.  Why do I have to be part of your rudeness?  Because you're, like, all Brave War and commercial break.  But I can understand, you know, that something might suck and I might hate it, but I'm not gonna...  And, Norton, what about you?  These gifts stink.  They do stink.  I don't want to be known as the bad guy today.  Chips.  A hat box.  The Lucille Ball hat box she bought when she was out with Viv.  She got that from a garage sale.  A little stupid hat in the box.  Yeah.  Now, take it back, Lucy. 
[01:36:00]  Now, Anthony, what's what it looks like?  Call her back in here.  But I understand I can get a bad gift and still be nice and not hurt people's feelings.  Call her back in here and give her her gift back.  Why do I have to hurt someone's feelings?  I will not bow to peer pressure and hurt someone's feelings.  Call her out on her gift.  I will tell her her gift sucks, but I will keep it.  Oh, you will, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah, let's see Anthony say that.  You're really not coming back in here.  Are you insane?  Hi, Erica.  I just wanted to say, Opie had a little mishandling of your gift. 
[01:36:30]  He bobbled it a little while he was trying to put it over by his stuff, and it broke.  But I have the cards and chips.  And thank you.  You guys, I know.  I know.  Anthony, tell her.  Throw them out.  You hate them.  I don't care.  What?  Tell her.  Don't bother me.  What?  Are those good chips?  I'm not saying that they're bad chips.  Are they good chips?  They're old.  They're probably from the 70s.  I just grabbed them.  70s Earth Mama chips.  70s Earth Mama muff chips.  Throw them away.  It would have been cool if it came from Frank Sinatra's house, but obviously it didn't. 
[01:37:00]  You know, they could be worth money.  You don't know.  I don't know.  If they weren't money, you'd be getting married.  You know.  What's wrong with that?  Nice.  That's a genuine wood chip holder, isn't it?  Hey, give me those chips.  I guess that would be for my face, Steve.  No, look.  Give her.  Give Obie the chips.  Look, I'm just thinking.  I like them.  I really do.  But I'm thinking maybe somebody else could use them more than I could.  I'd be more than happy to take them and throw them in the trash for you, Anthony. 
[01:37:30]  No, I'm not going to throw them in the trash, but perhaps somebody could use them more than I.  I'll take them back, Anthony.  Just give them to me.  Tell her.  She's yelling.  Tell her.  I'm trying to be nice.  What do you mean?  Why am I being yelled at?  You play Texas Hold'em.  Why can't you use those?  Well, they're just not quite the type of equipment I like playing with.  What kind do you like playing with?  They're chips and cards.  Well, different cards and different chips.  People play with different types of things.  Yes, sir.  I'll pass it back to Steve.  Give her the chips.  Just, Opie, give those to her. 
[01:38:00]  It's heavy.  These are the cards that are still...  There you go.  They're all wrapped up.  See, they're still wrapped.  They're all wrapped up.  You ever play 52-card pick-up?  Oh, gee.  Opie.  There's no reason I eat the cards at her.  Did the cards hit you?  Did they?  Opie, she had cards falling off her sleeve.  Come on.  No.  Oh, God damn it.  Opie, oh, my God. 
[01:38:30]  Opie.  Holy shit.  Opie.  Don't video this.  Oh, boy.  Now, clean it up.  Are you happy now, Opie?  Are you happy?  I am mortified.  Oh, Eric, she spilled my chips. 
[01:39:00]  I knew you'd do stuff like this.  Thanks.  She spilled my chips.  Oh, God.  You guinea brat.  Now, clean it up.  That's right.  Be a poker player, just like your father.  Oh, my God.  I'm mortified.  I apologize for the other half of this program. 
[01:39:30]  Don't apologize.  I don't really care.  That is uncalled for.  That was uncalled for.  I hope you got a good laugh.  I hope you got a good laugh.  God, he's still immersed in it.  He's fine.  He can laugh.  I can't even talk to him.  I knew from the start it was a bad idea to bring those in on the first place.  I should have just brought the couch and be done with it. 
[01:40:00]  That is horrible.  Look, I didn't have a problem with him or anything.  Oh, for some reason, I don't understand why he's got to be like that.  Oh, my God, it hurts.  I apologize for the actions of some of the people on this program, you know. 
[01:40:30]  Well, enjoy picking up your poker chips.  Thank you.  You guys can finish your show and talk about me and do whatever you want.  I don't care.  All right.  There she goes.  Wait, wait.  She's walking away.  Wait, can you take these?  Oh, look, she's getting her stuff.  She's not even going to sit back down.  She's getting her stuff and walk.  Oh, my God.  There she goes.  Ben, go smooth things over.  Ben, smooth things over a little bit. 
[01:41:00]  Remember when Rick had to smooth things over?  Guess what?  Now it's your fucking job.  If you wanted to be the big dog, go ahead.  There it is.  Yeah, you're the big producer now.  Go fix that.  That is the biggest laugh I've had on the show.  We broke it.  You fix it.  Because the way you threw them and rolled them across the console, it was a heavy thud and  they rolled and all just fell off.  And the chips were flying out and the chip carrier fell on her foot.  It was the most horrible thing I've ever seen one person do to another.  Oh, that's the biggest laugh I've had on the show. 
[01:41:30]  I couldn't breathe.  You are an awful person.  I literally could not breathe.  I was laughing so hard.  I don't know how you do that.  That just makes me so happy.  Those are things you think about doing sometimes, but no human does them.  But Opie, just stay.  Oh, these chips.  I'll break your bowl.  I'll throw the chips at you.  I'll fling the cards at your face.  Oh, these chips have coffee stains on them.  These are awful.  Oh, see, now you're brave.  Oh, I can't be brave with you.  Holy S.  The back of my skull hurts.  I laugh so hard.  Eric from Jersey. 
[01:42:00]  The sound of plastic chips raining to the floor is the saddest sound I've ever heard.  It will be like the sound of the thousands of tears she's going to shed in the car.  Yeah.  Just walk outside with Ben.  Ben's talking to her right now.  Yeah.  Gave her a nice garbage bag full of ONA stuff.  She is bawling.  Oh, my God.  See, I knew it.  Here's what she said.  She goes, I don't mind if he broke it.  But he threw it at me.  Oh, no.  And she turned her face into the wall near the elevator. 
[01:42:30]  And that's all you're hearing.  Stop it.  You are horrible.  Cringe radio is back, boys and girls.  It's about effing time.  She threw the chips.  I didn't throw him at her.  Hold on a minute.  I think he's being smoothed over them.  He actually didn't throw him at her.  I'm going to go check now.  I was a very good athlete when I was growing up.  And trust me, I didn't throw him at her.  Go fix that.  I made it very close.  Go fix that.  Oh, my God. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, that's awful.  I cannot.  I cannot believe that.  I'm horrified.  All right.  Opie has no soul.  Evil to the core.  Yeah.  That's what they're writing.  And I wonder why I'm alone.  Opie is the effing antichrist.  And I wonder why I'm alone.  I go home alone every day, and I wonder why.  Why am I alone?  Jesus.  Can't figure that one out. 
[01:43:30]  You made her cry.  I didn't want her to cry.  She was nice, and she tried to be good-natured about it.  I know.  She tried to take the ribbing.  It was the loud chips falling before the thing rolled off the console.  I know.  That was a big bet.  I'm all in.  I will splash the pot whenever the fuck I please.  Dude, you've got to read something to the end of the feedback.  This guy, Cody from Buffalo. 
[01:44:00]  Opie put some good force into throwing those chips.  Sounds like some South American ring stick.  No, that's...  I was horrified during that whole thing.  An update?  Yeah.  Yeah, Ben's calming her down.  Steve's out there.  They're getting her to breathe and calm down.  And they're going to try to see if she wants to come back in and get her picture.  Yeah, because she wanted pictures and stuff.  Tell her if she cleans up.  See, you're brave without her in the studio. 
[01:44:30]  That's the difference.  I admit it.  That's the difference between you and I.  Say that to her face.  I've done enough.  Haven't you done enough?  I think I've done enough.  I can't...  I don't know even...  What's going on out there?  It's not fun, Opie.  He threw it right at her.  I didn't throw it right at her.  Do we have the videotape?  You didn't get that on videotape?  You got that on videotape?  It kind of rolled on the console. 
[01:45:00]  I kind of just rolled it at her.  She had plenty of time to get out of the way.  Oh, she's a little upset.  Yeah, I would guess.  Drove all the way here from Rhode Island.  Just to give something to the show.  Yeah.  Want to get her photo.  Oh, my God.  She comes here to give something to the show and get a picture with Opie and Anthony.  Maybe she should have gave something to us from this decade.  Who are you to say that our gifts aren't good enough?  You know what?  He raised frankincense and myrrh not a good enough gift, Opie. 
[01:45:30]  We're starting a rule on this show.  You bring gifts.  Don't get them from a garage sale.  That's all we ask.  You know, Baby Jesus' best gift he got was a song from a little drummer boy, Opie.  That's right.  Opie.  It had nothing to do with materialism.  It had nothing to do with the gold, frankincense, and myrrh might have been good gifts.  But the little drummer boy's song was the best gift of all.  And I'd have taken that over those lousy chips.  All right.  Let me see the video, Anthony.  All right.  Here's the video.  We're looking back at the tape. 
[01:46:00]  She's all smiley.  Steve, I'll need a screening when you're done there.  Oh, my God.  Well, you kind of missed the toss, but you got the aftermath.  I wasn't really expecting you to do that, to be honest.  Oh, gee.  What did you think you were going to do?  Play a hand?  It's like catching a UFO.  You're just not expecting it.  Wow.  That's...  Look at Norton.  This is going to be great for foundrymusic.com.  I'm all in.  Show Anthony.  All right.  Bring that over here.  I got to see that.  I think the audio will really help that clip because you were too close on her face. 
[01:46:30]  But all you see is the chips go flying by her.  All right.  Well.  All right.  Let me get a look.  All right.  There's Opie with the devious smile on his face.  She's talking.  Still, yes.  Smiling.  Oh, my God.  No, that's...  Well, you see it clearly.  You see the chips flying by on the table.  Yes, Ben.  Not as if we've done enough damage to being in this new building already.  Yeah.  There's people just coming to work, getting off the elevator.  Yeah.  You see this all going on in the hallway and are just mortified. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, they see her crying out front.  Him filming it.  Yeah.  Not even trying to comfort her.  Could you face this way when you break down emotionally?  Oh, I'm horrified.  I am horrified.  Yeah, I'm not going to fix this one.  See, this is the type of thing, the barrier that people say, you know, how far do you take  things on satellite?  That's where, you know, I think the line should have been drawn somewhere. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah.  Girl just trying to bring some gifts to the show.  I definitely...  Give me those.  I'll pass them to her.  She enjoyed...  What?  What?  Give me those.  I'll pass them to her.  You're horrible, man.  That slip is hilarious.  You can see her face.  I mean, in the background, you can see the chips just flying by on the table.  Look at the construction workers looking at it like, what the hell is going on in there?  All right.  Well...  Awful.  Should we take our last break and then regroup here, I guess?  I think. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, that was great.  I...  Why don't you go out and take your picture with her, Ope?  Yeah.  Old fan from the AF days?  She's been a fan since the AF days.  Whatever.  First time in 10 years she's going to meet us.  Go buy Demented World and shut up.  No.  She's, uh...  She's a nice lady.  Cash up, niggas.  All my niggas in the P now, right now.

And niggas take pictures at the funerals and shit, right? 
[01:49:00]  Niggas, wait a minute.  Get over by the casket, boy.  Hold your mama's hand up.  That's good.  Goddamn fast cube done broke.  Wait a minute.  I want to be cremated, right?  Sprinkle my asses in about two pounds of cocaine.  Snart me up.  There'll be a lot of motherfuckin' snotting, Clark, into the applause. 
[01:49:30]  Niggas be sittin' around cryin'.  I'm like, niggas, she'll make a hell of a cut.  Rampo got his teeth knocked out in 1952. 
[01:50:00]  From a stray foul ball, Joe DiMaggio hit the count.  It was 0 and 2.  I'll never forget the sound he made when I bawled him in the lips.  He tried to cuss and tried to swear.  The only thing he said was this.  Ah!  Ah!  You okay, Grandpa?  Ah!

Hey, guys, how you doing?  Long time listener.  Glad to have you back.  Love to show you.  Jeff, welcome to the program.  Hey, uh, gotta tell you, you gotta get rid of Norton.  Dump this guy because he sucks.  What? 
[01:53:00]  Every time he opens his mouth, he drains the funny from the room.  Whoa, easy there, Jeff.  I gotta tell you, hey, Norton, Bob Kelly was on the other day.  I couldn't tell the difference between him and you.  Get a new stick, buddy.  You stole it from him.  You're a one-trick pony.  Yeah, your mother's a one-trick pony, too.  When I give her money, she sucks my dick and eats my ass.  You fucking fan with an opinion.  Your mother's a trick-turning pony.  She sucks horse cock while bad 70s music plays.  Unfunny little troll. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, an unfunny little troll, buddy.  That's the best you have, unfunny little troll?  I say your mother sucks pony dick on film, and you call me a troll?  Do I trip-trap under a bridge?  Drop dead, motherfucker.  I'm not a professional.  You're a professional.  You're not a professional.  You're a fucking nobody.  You're an anonymous zero.  I may suck, but your mother swallows and takes it on the face.  Hey, my mother may take it on the face, but at least she's funnier than you, motherfucker.  She's not funnier than me. 
[01:54:00]  The only thing funnier about her is she's a woman with a cock.  That's what's funny about your mother.  And she dangles it over your father's face like a Roman war helmet.  You're the worst, man.  I may be the worst, but I'm well-paid, and you're a listener.  So sit there, boy, and listen.  Put on your headphones and listen, little fella.  I drain the funny out of a room the way your mother drains semen out of black cocks.  Where'd he go?  I don't think he could take it. 
[01:54:30]  Holy Jesus.  First of all, how does he come out against the beloved Jimmy Norton on this program?  It has to happen sometimes.  I have to apologize.  I knew Norton was having a bad day.  And he's been sitting there during commercials going, I have nothing today.  He's just not.  He's talking about how he took, what, Tylenol PM or something?  Oh, I took it last night about midnight.  I'm just wiped.  It's like an opium.  I can tell Norton is just like kind of not happening today. 
[01:55:00]  He's a little miserable.  And I knew that guy wanted to go after you.  I set you up so fast.  Oh, he could call everyone good.  I could have helped you out like an old pal.  No, you should have let him through every time.  Let him through every time.  That was really good.  Instead, I'm like, I know this is going to get him going, man.  Rob from Melville, Norton rocks, that caller blows.  Wow.  All right.  XM John 2.  The OPN Anthony Show.  Hey, Mike, what's going on?  Not much, man.  Hey, man.  I know what you guys are talking about.  I walked in on my ex-wife fucking my best friend, man. 
[01:55:30]  Let me tell you.  Ow.  And on top of that, she was nagging and nagging and nagging.  And then the bitch had the gold shirt fucking taken for half my paycheck.  I'm like, no, sweetheart.  I don't think so.  Them's the rules.  Are you still friends with the guy?  Well, yeah.  Yeah, he was my best friend, man.  Are you still friends with him?  Oh, I don't know.  No, no, no, no.  I scared the shit out of him right now.  I so much is twitching in front of him.  And he's out the door fucking heading down the block.  What position were they in when you found him?  Missionary, man. 
[01:56:00]  Did he have a big gun?  Yeah.  Wait, let me ask you a question.  You still see him?  Why does he twitch now?  Where do you still bump into this guy?  What was that?  Where do you still see him?  Why do you still see him?  I got two boys with her.  What's that?  I got two kids with her, man.  Oh, he lives with her now?  What?  He lives with her now?  This guy doesn't understand.  Wow, now I understand why the wife had to move on.  Really?  She's like, look, just move to the left and I'll come. 
[01:56:30]  What?  No, dude.  What Norton is asking, okay, if it was your friend, you found him banging your wife, but  you still run into him.  Is that because he's now living with her?  Oh, yeah.  And raising your two kids.  How does that make you feel?  Uh, I still want to tee off on his forehead.  How long was that relationship going on before you found out about it, sir?  It sucked, man.  I wanted out.  You know, you guys were talking about the cell phone.  Or any question you feel like asking is acceptable. 
[01:57:00]  Well, that Falangong's got to, you know, we need to support us.  Do you think that it was going on for a long time before you actually walked in on them,  sir?  Uh, no.  How long have they been living together?  How long have they been living together now?  What?  How long have they been living together?  Uh, about two years.  Do you still talk to him at all if you have to?  How do the kids feel about him?  Sir? 
[01:57:30]  What?  How do the kids feel about him?  Does it bother you that he lives...  They were too young to even know about this shit, so...  No, no, but does it bother you that he lives with the kids, I'm saying?  Uh, man, you're breaking up hardcore, what?  Does it bother you that he lives with the children?  That he what, the children?  That he lives with them.  Uh, I think your mic's too loud.  I can't hear you, dude. 
[01:58:00]  Oh, really?  All right.  Yeah, I can hear you just fine, but, uh...  All right, we're gonna move on.  Thank you.  Hey, kids, do you like Jimpogo-mon?  Yeah!  Then you're gonna love...  Alabama-man!  Alabama-man!  He's quick, he's strong, he's after him!  You can take Alabama-man to the bowling alley, where he drinks heavily and shoots tobacco!  Wow!  He can bowl!  He can bowl, he can drink, he can drink some more!  Alabama-man!  When wife asks him where he's been, just use the action button, and Alabama-man busts her lip open!  Shut up, bitch! 
[01:58:30]  Wow!  The piece of the body has slipped in her!  Alabama-man!  I want to be just like Alabama-man!  Alabama-man comes with everything you see here, wife's not separate.  I thought I told you to shut up!  Not all people from Alabama are white beaters.  My dad took me to see the Village People when I was a little boy.  Oh!  What?  Really?  In concert.  I saw them in concert.  Why would your dad take you to see the Village People?  I don't know.  Why would I play Monster Rain?  How many questions are we gonna ask?  I'm just saying that I went to see the Village People, and Sister Sledge was the opening band.  So was he a fan of the Village People? 
[01:59:00]  No, I was.  I had all their records.  And you were family.  Wow, that's a big surprise.  YMCA, I had In the Navy, I had Macho Man was great, and the live one, Live and Sleazy.  You were the strangest little kid.  Just a little weirdo.  And he's a normal man?  No.  How did you discover the Village People?  They were huge in the 70s!  No, no, no, no, no, dude.  There was knowing about the Village People, and then discovering the Village People.  I don't know, but I remember the construction crew covers. 
[01:59:30]  Like, I discovered in my little brain, Zeppelin, Black Sabbath.  We have something in common.  I was a big Sabbath fan when I first started, you know, getting into music.  Village People, you knew the songs, you heard them a lot, but it wasn't like, I need to buy their albums.  He must have been an AM listening person.  Oh my god, they're coming to the Nassau Coliseum, I gotta wait in line and get my ticket.  Why would you get into that band?  The two concerts in the 70s my dad took me to were Kiss at the Garden, and the Village People.  And did you realize, looking around, what was in the audience? 
[02:00:00]  I don't remember, dude.  I didn't even know they were gay.  I had no idea.  I mean, you know, Felipe Rose, the Indian, I probably would have realized was gay.  Victor Willis, the late singer, I heard wasn't gay.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  You know the names of the guys?  I know a couple of the names.  It's Felipe Rose and, you know, Victor Willis, the lead singer.  Oh, man.  Who doesn't know that?  I am what I am.  I mean, I should have known that that was a gay song.  Oh my god, Club Soda Kenny.  Hi, Kenny.  I didn't even know you entered the studio, Kenny.  Hello, everybody.  How are you?  I have a question for Jimmy Kins.  Sure.  Why would you be coming into the city today? 
[02:00:30]  I just, I'm just wondering.  To see your lovely face.  Ah.  Why don't you raise the mic up instead of hunching over?  Uh-huh.  You're 6'8".  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.  You have to raise the mic up to the ceiling.  Look at him.  I'm starting to think there might be something going on today, Anthony.  C-A-Y-A-M-I-G-A.  Now, I wanted to ask Jimmy Kins at that concert.  Is that where you learned how to rub up against people?  No, I don't remember.  Oh, frottage?  I engaged in frottage in high school, it's called.  Frottage.  I actually almost got thrown out of school because I did it to a teacher. 
[02:01:00]  Will you bump into a girl's ass with your hand and you see if you can get both cheeks?  I did it to a miss...  I don't want to say her last name.  Wow.  I did it to a teacher.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  It's called frottage?  Frottage is the actual fetish of rubbing your cock on people.  I would do that all the time.  And one time I did it to a teacher in the pool area.  Miss Dunn, her name was.  Wait, you were trying to rub your cock on two cheeks?  Or your hand, whatever you could get.  Getting over that butt crack is a...  I used to go home and whack off thinking about how many cheeks I got.  And I got Miss Dunn.  We were in the pool area.  I walked by.  It was just me and her walking by and I just grazed. 
[02:01:30]  It was called grazing.  I grazed her ass and I felt her spin and glare at me and I just kept walking.  Oh, you little creep.  And it was your...  Yeah.  You definitely got her with your junk, not your hand?  No, no, no.  My hand.  My hand.  Which is worse.  It's like I grabbed her ass.  I've been in the back of my hand, both knuckles across and the little slope.  Cheek crack.  Cheek.  Little Jimmy leaving.  Leaving some chocolate treat he just ate on our butt.  Little telltale fingerprints.  My high school was known for ETs. 
[02:02:00]  What were those?  Elbow tits.  Oh.  That's too violent.  You couldn't get a good feel with an ETs.  No, you can't get a feel with an elbow either.  No, it wasn't.  It was as soft as possible, too.  I mean, even just the elbow is a hard bone, I'm saying.  Just walking by, you just, you know, walk with your elbows a little higher.  That's all.  Dude, I used to love...  It was a weird thing in my high school.  Everyone used to talk about it.  The ETs.  You got an ETs today?  My favorite girl was Liz.  She was a senior.  I was a freshman.  I used to always try to bump into her because she was juicy, man.  I would look at girls and just figure I have to graze her somehow.  They would probably all know and go, oh, here comes that creepy Jimmy kid. 
[02:02:30]  Do you still do that?  No.  No.  It's actually...  I'll avoid it now.  It feels too violating.  No.  I don't do that at all anymore.  Ever.  What the hell was that?  So, the Village People.  That's...  That's...  They were good lives.  Sister Sledge.  We Are Family was a big hit.  Who didn't enjoy Sister Sledge in 78?  Did you have Village People posters in your room?  I might have.  I don't remember.  Oh, my God.  I don't remember.  Oh, my God.  What did you dress up like?  No, I didn't dress up as a village people.  Oh, that would have been cute.  Jimmy went dressed up like a little cowboy or something. 
[02:03:00]  No, I was...  I think Glenn was one of the guys, too.  I don't remember all their names.  Of course, it was Glenn.  There was the construction worker, of course.  Listen, I didn't know they were gay.  I didn't get it.  I didn't know Village meant, you know, 14th Street to Houston.  I mean, I didn't realize that.  You thought it was like a village.  Like a village of cool people.  Right.  Where all men worked and sang.  Cool people.  They were cool.  The Indian was my favorite.  Growing up, the Indian was my favorite.  I thought he was the coolest.  Yeah.  Dude, I was about 10, and I knew they were gay.  And I didn't even know what gay meant.  No, I was very young. 
[02:03:30]  I didn't understand.  I didn't know that.  I just knew that's not how they dress when they're out on the street doing those professions.  I didn't know.  All these things add up, though.  The monster rain, this, the playing asteroids for a...  I was a weirdo.  You were a weird little kid.  I didn't say was.  I used to fantasize.  That bothers me that you think there's a was in that sentence.  Kiss were my heroes.  Kiss in the 70s.  Well, Kiss was all our heroes.  And I used to fantasize.  I bought every Kiss album.  So did I.  Well, it was bought from me.  But I used to fantasize about Kiss.  Not sexually, but they would come to my house. 
[02:04:00]  I had a problem that they wore makeup.  I was a little uncomfortable with the Kiss makeup thing.  No, that's why I liked them.  That's why, because they were like superheroes.  They were like superheroes.  I got to hear this fantasy.  That they would come...  This was a recurring one.  The Kiss would come to my apartment and hurt me and kick me down the stairs and beat me.  And then hug me and love me and make me feel better.  You're kidding.  No.  To please tell me...  Oh, no.  That was a...  This is a joke.  That was a recurring fantasy.  It was never sexual, though.  It was about...  Like, I don't know why I associated...  Because I had a pretty normal household.  I always associated that uncomfortability with love. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  Have you ever met his parents?  They're very nice, normal people.  They're the nicest people you'll ever meet.  Never abusive.  They were just...  They were really great to grow up with.  So where did this come from?  Oh, my dad drank a little abusive shirt.  Why would you have this fantasy that Kiss...  Don't know.  Kiss comes to your house.  Now, do they knock or are they just there?  Don't remember.  I can just remember my steps in my house and picturing Paul and Gene and all of them loving  me and making me feel better and hugging me and telling me I was a good boy.  But they're the ones that beat you.  That's the oddness of it.  I don't know where it's...  Look, why would I fantasize about... 
[02:05:00]  Why would my little play...  My favorite play friend...  I had two play friends growing up.  One was a middle-aged woman named Helen with a beehive hairdo.  I don't know where that came from.  That was one of my imaginary friends.  Imaginary friend was Helen.  Helen.  Helen.  Yeah, with a beehive hairdo.  And one was a...  Keep tabs on all this, people.  You'll be tested.  One was a little boy who looked...  Who was me.  But he wore a cape.  And his name was Jimmy Robinson.  And me...  And me...  I can't absorb all this stuff.  You're going too quickly.  It's all true.  I want to remember all of this. 
[02:05:30]  And me and Jimmy Robinson hated Jimmy Norton.  That I remember.  You know...  Wait, wait.  You and Jimmy Robinson...  My fantasy friend was Jimmy Robinson.  But it was me.  In a cape.  But how could you and him hate you?  Gee, I don't know.  That was just the fantasy that I would play with Jimmy Robinson.  And Jimmy Norton was another fantasy character.  I mean, so there's psychologists all over the tri-state area writing this down.  Oh, my gosh.  I don't know.  Split personality crap.  No, no, no.  I don't think it was split personality.  It was just this weird self-esteem stuff.  Did you and him hate him? 
[02:06:00]  Did you talk to Jimmy Robinson?  Oh, yeah.  I remember.  I can...  My only memory of, like, a vivid...  Jimmy Robinson!  My only memory...  Because I thought he was cool from Lost in Space.  Will Robinson.  Will Robinson.  Jimmy Robinson.  So my only real memory of Jimmy Robinson was him riding a tricycle, which was me,  with his cape on, flowing behind him.  That's how young I was.  I don't know where he came from.  Did it say anything on your cape?  No.  It was just a plain cape, as all cool people have.  Don't have J.R. on your chest?  No, no, no, no.  Bum, bum, bum, bum.  I think you were touched at a very, very young age.  It's very possible, dude, but...  I mean, very. 
[02:06:30]  Like, under five.  There's other things that contribute to self-esteem, too.  It's not necessarily that.  It doesn't always have to be that.  You know, I'm just going to throw this out there, because I know it's a hacky radio bit,  but I don't know.  Would you ever go under hypnosis?  I've tried already.  On our show?  No.  They tried.  I can't be hypnotized.  They tried on Tough Crowd recently, because there was a really funny idea.  I don't know what they were going to have me do, but they were going to hypnotize me to  do something, and then Patrice, they were going to try to hypnotize...  Like, every time Colin said a certain word, Patrice would just shut up, because he would  always talk over people, so that was... 
[02:07:00]  But I can't be hypnotized.  I can't relax enough.  No.  I tried to, and the guy's like, you're getting sleepy.  Can you imagine him under hypnosis with, like, a real expert?  This guy was an expert.  No, I'm just saying, if we did it on the show...  No, I can't be.  Yeah.  I'm too easily distracted.  I don't buy any of that, anyway.  Okay, now you covered the Jimmy Robinson.  What about the woman, now, that was your playmate?  I don't know where she came from.  Helen was my...  I don't know where she...  Helen.  Helen, an older...  That's like a librarian, or...  Yes.  Was that the type of woman she was?  Yeah, she was in her... 
[02:07:30]  I'm picturing her right now.  After Helen Keller.  No, it wasn't after Helen Keller.  It was...  You could picture what she looked like as a real person?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  She actually...  Maybe I saw a picture of my mother when she was very young, because it reminds me a little  bit of my mom, like, from the 60s, who I, you know, obviously was before I was born.  But Helen had a beehive hairdo, frosted, and she was my imaginary friend, which Helen.  I don't know why.  I love this stuff, man.  It's completely true.  It is insane.  That's bizarre.  Every day, I learn a little more about what just a little creep you are. 
[02:08:00]  Just a frightening, little, messed-up kid.  Oh, it was...  I love it.  Stop with the where...  You know what it is?  Were and was is fine, because now he's an adult who makes his own decisions.  It's based on, you know, what he wants to do.  He's a freewheeling guy.  If he wants to buy hookers and have him crap on, that's fine.  You're an adult.  As a kid, it's creepy, because kids do things like play with their friends, with toys.  They enjoy Christmas.  They enjoy their parents.  They don't make up little playmates that are them with capes and little school marm-type playmates that are 50 friggin' years old with beehive hairdos. 
[02:08:30]  They don't play Monster Rain.  They don't enjoy the village people.  It's just a creepy little thing.  The village people, the only thing you're wrong about is the village people, because they were very big back then.  And again, when you're that young, you don't recognize...  Maybe as a kid, they were colorful and fun.  Makeup.  They had the costumes.  I love Kiss for that reason, too.  There you go.  Oh, the Kiss beating story?  That's odd, yeah.  I don't think we can find another listener that grew up listening to the village people. 
[02:09:00]  I guarantee you can.  No way.  Dude, they were in the 70s, man.  They were huge.  I would hear them when I'm driving.  You know, my mother and I would listen.  We all knew who they were, but you didn't become a fan of the village people.  You just didn't.  Well, back then, it was a whole...  There was not one person in my high school that went around saying, you know, he liked the village people.  Because there was a disco rock split back then.  I didn't know about that.  I was a little too young.  How old were you?  When you were a junior or whatever.  How old were the village people popular?  78?  So I was 10.  All right.  He's 10 years old.  So it's different, you know.  I was 11 when I saw... 
[02:09:30]  My father took me to see Kiss in the Garden, I think Cheap Trick, open, in December 16th of 79 on the Alive 2 tour.  You can't justify that you're 10 and you're a village people fan not knowing, you know.  That's fine.  The Kiss thing, you'd be a Kiss fan, that's fine.  But you would be a Kiss fan without the images of them beating you up and then coddling you and saying it's going to be okay.  And hugging.  I told you, I got my picture with Kiss recently.  The first time I'd ever met, I mean, with Gene, I was starstruck.  You were scared you were going to get bitch slapped by Paul Stanley.  Dude, when he...  Did Paul and your band of Stanley to bitch slap you? 
[02:10:00]  He didn't bitch slap.  Oh, and the thing.  He put it behind the...  Your fantasy, did he hold your head close to his puffy hair chest?  No, dude, it wasn't about sexual stuff.  Hello, everybody!  Dude, he...  We're gonna cuddle Jimmy Naughton!  He, from behind me, I had the photo, you could see the photo, I'm standing there, he reaches around behind me and puts his arm on my chest.  This is last November, I tilted my head and put it on his bicep.  It was like a childhood hero thing.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it was like, I almost held his arms, I didn't do it.  It was your fantasy come true.  It wasn't about sex, you know, I don't want to touch Paul Stanley, but it was like, it's like a superhero. 
[02:10:30]  That's another part of the weirdness.  He would like for you to touch him.  Yeah, probably.  That's another part of the weirdness.  If you said you had some kind of physical attraction and it was a sexual thing, it would be disgusting to me, but...  But the thing is, it's creepy.  Yeah.  That you just wanted them to say, you know, to like your company and love you and be my friend and hug me.  And beating you.  After kicking me down the steps and beating me up. 
[02:11:00]  That is so weird.  Oh.  I gotta play the Monster Rain thing.  We're not taking a break, but Monster Rain, the commercial by Laszlo.  Yeah.  From GTA.  It's not in GTA, but Laszlo decided to put this together for us.  Check it out.  He was just the boy next door.  Mikey, where are you?  It's the game for kids that's sweeping the country.  Jimmy, what are you doing?  Jesus H. Christ, my little babies! 
[02:11:30]  Monster Rain.  Monster Rain.  The game you play under the porch.  Monster Rain.  I like that one, man.  It's hilarious.  That is bizarre, though, man.  Yeah, I know.  It's a little odd.  I admit it.  I don't know where it comes from or what it is.  I don't know.  Jimmy Robinson.  The cape.  Well, here's a guy that also listens to the Village People.  I'm stupefied today. 
[02:12:00]  Steve, what's up?  I'm using Steve because I ain't giving my real name.  I gotta back up, Jim.  I honestly listen to the Village People.  Really?  How old are you?  I mean, all right, listen.  We all heard them on the radio.  I mean, did you consider yourself a fan?  Yep.  How old were you?  So weird.  Two years older than you, Jimmy.  Oh, yeah, you were 12, 13.  I mean, it's pretty normal.  They were kind of cool guys, you thought, back then.  Like I said, I'm saying Steve because I'm in Brooklyn.  Live and sleazy. 
[02:12:30]  You know, that was a good song when you were young.  I only know a couple of the hits.  That's about it.  In the Navy?  Well, in the Navy, I know.  YMCA, obviously everybody knows, but there's a couple of...  Macho Man?  You can't go to a wedding without hearing like YMCA or something at the end of the night.  Yeah.  And the Yankees...  That awful grounds crew.  The grounds crew would come out and...  What's the stand for with the Village People?  Young men carry AIDS?  Chris from Boston.  Hey, guys, can you picture little Jim in his little Kiss Army makeup with a little black 
[02:13:00]  tear running down his face after getting his ass kicked by grown men in cat makeup?  I never dressed up like Kiss.  Never wore the Kiss makeup.  Oh, well, that fixes everything.  It would almost be sacrilegious.  I felt that I couldn't...  Really?  Yeah.  No, I never dressed up like Kiss.  You were a huge Kiss fan then.  Beyond.  Dude, my father had to buy tickets six months in advance, and we were almost in the top  row in the garden.  That's how Kiss in the 70s was bigger than anybody is today. 
[02:13:30]  And it was the night of the concert, like, this was a big thing.  It was going to be amazing.  Dude, I was a god in the neighborhood.  No one else could get tickets.  They're like, Jimmy's going to see Kiss.  This is in August.  In December, he's going to see Kiss.  Yeah.  I couldn't believe my dad got me tickets.  Tell him to get out from under the porch.  It's time to go to Kiss.  Maybe there's another reason you were a god in the neighborhood.  Sucking all their wieners.  You'd think you would get better tickets for all the sucking you did as a kid.  My god.  I still didn't tell you about the brother and sister that I used to have sit on my face  so I could smell their pee-stained underwear.  I'll tell you about that someday. 
[02:14:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Considering the show really blows today, maybe you should pull that one out of your back pocket.  Yeah.  I can't say their names, but when I was that young.  Why the brother, too?  Again, it wasn't a sex.  It was just the smell of piss.  It wasn't him sexually.  Actually, it was...  Was it you or Jimmy Robinson that was you?  It was, unfortunately, Jimmy Norton.  I'd love to blame that one on Helen, but I think she was trying to ixnay on the face-sitting A.  But no, it wasn't about the one.  I was attracted to the sister, actually.  That was the girl that was naked one time in front of me, and I loved her ass so much  I was sitting next to some sticker bushes.  And I'm like, you can either sit in my lap or sit in the sticker bushes. 
[02:14:30]  And she sat in the sticker bushes, which destroyed my little self-esteem.  And how old were you?  Again, second, third grade.  I moved out of that neighborhood Halloween of fourth grade, which is the very beginning  of fourth grade.  So anything I'm talking about, this stuff, all happened before Halloween of fourth grade.  All of it.  Yeah.  And a brother and sister.  Not at the same time, but yeah.  They both would pee their pants.  I imagine they had a wonderful upbringing.  Not at the same time.  No, I mean, it wasn't some weird...  And it wasn't even a sexual thing. 
[02:15:00]  It wasn't some weird, he starts saying.  See, we could almost let you off the hook if it was them together, because then you could  say, well, I did it because the sister...  I don't know, but that means you were just under the porch with the...  No, no, this was behind the bushes.  Behind the bushes.  Yeah.  And what would you say?  Take off your pants?  No, no, no, with pants on.  No, it was never nude.  Oh, all pants.  The only one I wanted to see nude was the sister, who I had a real crush on.  I would love to take a blacklight to his childhood home, behind the bushes, under the porch.  You'd say, sit on my face?  Don't remember how it would go. 
[02:15:30]  I honestly don't remember.  I can just remember liking the smell.  Yeah, there's got to be a beginning to that, though.  I'm sure there is.  It probably happened during wrestling, and I would pretend to lose.  I don't know.  Oh, got you.  Do not know.  All right.  Let's...  But the girl I really had a crush on.  She was a year older than me.  So glad we're getting the gay out of the show.  Where is she buried now?  Yeah, where can we find her?  Hanging out with Paul and Jean on Sunday afternoon.  And then they pushed me down the stairs. 
[02:16:00]  Mason B to come for me.  They tell me it's okay.  They kissed my head and lost my hair.  So here's for you, Jimmy Robinson.  Come in with your cape and fly away.  I'm so gay.  What's that you say, Jimmy Robinson?  Helen wants to come over and play.  Monster Ray. 
[02:16:30]  Monster Ray.  Hiding under porches with the next door neighbor's kid.  I've learned to live with all the awful things I did.  Telling jokes so I don't have to kill myself.  So here's for you, Jimmy Robinson. 
[02:17:00]  I'm a sorry mess and you're too lame.  I live in shame.  Who could you, Jimmy Robinson?  Why'd you have to make me play that game?  Monster Ray.  Monster Ray. 
[02:17:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show Award for Most Disturbing Phone Call goes to...  Donkey Sausage.  What the...  Do me one favor.  What cuddles?  Why don't you get some whore into your studio and have her shit on the plate and put it in the microwave.  And then have her roll around in the screaming donkey sausage, donkey sausage.  Raquel?  That would be me.  You want to shit on a plate for us?  Okay.  And then run around saying what?  Donkey sausage?  Donkey sausage.  Dude, Jimmy Dean's donkey sausage. 
[02:18:00]  I can do that.  I can do that.  Donkey sausage!  Donkey sausage!  Donkey sausage!  I like it.  There's something oddly attractive about that.  That's gotta be a promo.

Nobody said men were the brightest, but hundreds of men nationwide are falling for girls that don't really exist.  In a new scam, beautiful Russian women will email men in the United States and begin a lengthy dialogue, flirting the whole time. 
[02:20:30]  She emails beautiful pictures of herself and gets to know her new online boyfriend.  She then begs to meet and says she'll fly to the United States so they can meet in person.  The guy picks flights, wires money, heads to the airport on the day of arrival, and is shocked when she never arrives.  Russian criminals have been using this new scam extensively, and guys are falling for it.  According to the New York Times, the U.S. Embassy is receiving between 5 and 10 complaints a day from guys swindled out of hundreds and even thousands of dollars.  The Russian criminals are scouring dating sites like Match.com and contacting men who post their profiles there. 
[02:21:00]  So if you meet the love of your life on the Internet and she asks you to wire money, it's probably not a good idea.  I'm Laszlo.  That's what's on my underground hard drive.  It's the O&A virus, XM 202, XM News, talk, sports, and information.  It's everything all the time.  You're Opie and Anthony when they don't suck.  Good for what ails you, what what?  The worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[02:21:30]  All right, we got the Tony Danza clips here, Anthony.  Good stuff.  Oh my God.  I don't even know if this could be the worst show on television.  I think you're both wrong, actually.  I think it's a good show.  Shut up.  I like the guy.  I think he's got pizzazz.  This is what America wants to see on their TV.  He has moxie and spunk.  That's what I'm trying to say.  This is what America wants to see, obviously.  It is?  Well, yeah.  They gave him a prime slot.  He's on every morning.  I don't know.  And the crowd seems to be enjoying the show. 
[02:22:00]  We watch every day after the show to see what Tony's up to next.  Yeah, we watch, all right.  Another cooking segment.  He was shooting baskets yesterday.  He was making...  With Frankie Munez.  He was making meatballs the day before, and he was loading a dishwasher, I believe, on Monday.  Yeah, if your talk show involves you and a guest seeing who could load a dishwasher faster, please, please leave.  This is what it's come down to, though.  You can't do anything edgy or anything, and so you're stuck watching Tony Danza, you know, fill up a dishwasher. 
[02:22:30]  You're afraid to take any chances because of the climate out there, the FCC.  So nothing can be done except for Tony Danza cooking with that worthless chef.  What's his name?  Oh, that dickhead Rocco Disparito.  Rocco, the chef Rocco that had that restaurant for the TV show that flopped.  And then he drags his geriatric mother out there, and Tony's got to be all nice to her.  Oh, and they all cook together.  Tony's helping out. 
[02:23:00]  Got his little Tony Danza apron on as he, you know, stir that up a little, Tony.  All right, I'm stirring.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  And the audience claps at anything like a bunch of sheep.  It's a good show, and I think you guys are being too harsh.  I think that his monologues are funny and lighthearted.  Right.  He's enjoyable.  I like listening to him.  I think you should play some clips and let them speak for themselves.  Yeah, I think so, but first I want to say hi to John in Long Island.  John, what's going on?  Nothing.  How you doing, man? 
[02:23:30]  Pretty good.  We're all over the ball field today.  What do you got for the show?  I got a recording.  I was watching some porn last night, and I got a recording of this shit going down on  some guy and gagging and puking and after listening to that one yesterday, so you guys  would appreciate it.  Yeah, the problem is we can play these clips all day, and we're going to listen to John's  today, but we really enjoyed the live thing much more.  Yeah, the live is great.  All right, but let's hear what John has from Long Island.  I can't get my head down there just yet, but when I do, I'll give you guys a point.  All right, Jesus. 
[02:24:00]  I can drive and do it at the same time.  All right, let's hear it, John.  All right.  Now, you've got to understand that all of the crackling is slurping.  It's not a bad recording.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  Good setup.  Beautiful.  All right.  Here's John.  All right.  All right.  What is that? 
[02:24:30]  What is that?  It sounds like the audio from the Kennedy assassination?  Yeah.  From the cop's motorcycle?  As they try to count the bullets?  The shots, I mean?  Jeez.  All right.  We're going to have to give up on John.  Yeah, that just wasn't quite working.  Horrid.  All right.  It's like black box audio from a plane crash.  What the?  I was trying, guys.  I'm sorry.  So we're talking about Tony Banza.  Yeah.  We noticed something as we watched the show every day. 
[02:25:00]  He gets cheap applause breaks.  I don't think they're cheap.  Oh, stop it.  He is the king of the cheap applause break.  Like, when you say, for some reason, the audience is trained to just clap at any drivel that comes out of this guy's mouth.  Angela.  It's a horrible, horrible, just what people think America wants today.  So we put together.  It's what we're stuck with.  This is a prime example of what this country is stuck with. 
[02:25:30]  You know, the problem is this with what you guys are saying.  Like, I listen to the clips as well, and I agree.  Like, I agree that they should be applauding when they were applauding.  That's why I don't think they're gratuitous.  I felt that what he said was worthy of applause.  You are a liar.  I'm not.  You are.  Are you trying to get on the Tony Danza show?  Yeah, perhaps that's it.  You know something?  You can't even trash Tony Danza.  If you have to sit there and kiss his ass because he might be able to help you out at some point in your career.  The applause breaks, and I felt that they were all at a time that I myself would have applauded. 
[02:26:00]  All right.  Well, we took his monologue yesterday.  This is all from one stupid monologue.  One monologue.  Two, three.  And I think he has about six applause breaks here.  Cheap applause breaks.  Not even applause because it was a good joke.  Just applause because he stated something.  But he has personality.  This guy has personality, and it comes through when he talks.  Do you guys have the same manager?  Let's just put it on the table.  Oh.  No, we don't.  I just happen to think that his personality comes through, and that just brings out a nice feeling in people. 
[02:26:30]  So when are you going to be on Tony's show?  I'm not.  I'm probably not going to be on Tony's show, as his audience is probably not my target audience.  Not your cup of tea.  I just sit back and enjoy.  It's not their brand of humor.  Good point, Ant.  That's probably a better way of putting it.  Jimmy's stand-up.  All right, well.  You see Jimmy going out there and doing his act in front of those rubes that he gets in that audience?  Did you get it?  She was pregnant.  She sneezed.  And then there was a lump on the floor.  Where are you going, folks? 
[02:27:00]  All right.  Well, here we go.  Tony Danza getting cheap applause breaks, Anthony.  Here's the first one.  But I want to congratulate the Boston Red Sox and the Red Sox nation.  I want to congratulate everyone.  There it is.  Easy cheap applause break.  Well, sometimes when you're the loser, you have to be magnanimous.  See?  If I knew what that meant, it would be even better.  Riga!  But I happen to think that the Red Sox fans deserve a little applause.  And the fact that Tony's being magnanimous, I like it. 
[02:27:30]  All right.  Here's another one.  As he tries to get a cheap applause.  I'm called TiVo man.  He's talking about how he TiVo's stuff.  Where's our applause thing, man?  Because we could be doing this when we're really bombing.  Like, I need a TiVo.  I've got to record things.  So I'm TiVo man.  And they applauded that.  Hey, guys. 
[02:28:00]  I'm eating oatmeal this morning.  No, no.  See, the oatmeal is not funny.  TiVo man was very funny.  Why was TiVo man funny?  Because, like, the guy TiVos all the time.  He's become, like, TiVo man.  I mean, I would laugh if I heard that.  Yay.  What the hell is that?  That's audio from outside Fenway, it sounds like.  Now, see, we need better applause.  We need better applause.  We need our old applause sound clip.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, the old one was great.  Here's Tony Danza getting another cheap applause.  So I got my tuxedo, you know, and I had it in a bag and everything. 
[02:28:30]  And I got dressed, but on my tux.  And I had a fan for it pretty good.  And I went to button my coat as we were leaving.  And we were late.  Went to button my coat.  Wait, wait, wait.  There's no button.  No button on my tux.  I'm the host.  So now this is an emergency.  Didn't have a black button.  Right, so what are you going to do?  Well, John was with me, so I cut one off his suit.  No, you didn't.  Yeah.  What a creative producer.  Who was it?  Cut a button off the suit of the producer.  And he gets an applause break for that.  Cut a break for that.  Because we can all picture ourselves in that situation. 
[02:29:00]  You got a thing to go to.  Oh, no, there's not a button on my suit.  I'm going to smack you.  Why?  We really are going to smack you.  All right.  Well, I relate to Tony.  He's like an everyman.  There's a bunch of these.  Here's another one.  I sewed the button on there.  Boom, boom, boom.  You should have seen me.  I would love to have seen this.  No, I was happy.  My mother would have been so proud of me.  So I took it down, man.  Oh, my God.  Look.  He talks about...  Oh.  So crazy.  I'm in.  He got out.  He talks about how he sewed a button. 
[02:29:30]  Now, I listened to the whole break.  Believe me, I did my research.  I had to sit through this.  He talked about how his tux didn't have a button on it.  So he had to sew a button on his tuxedo.  And he took one from his producer.  As the limo was...  In his limo.  Moving.  Took one from his producer and sewed it on.  And as he's...  Right there, that clip.  As he's telling people he sewed a button on himself, they break into applause.  What?  You know who deserves applause for saying that?  Bob Dole. 
[02:30:00]  If Bob Dole says, I sewed a button on, then you should clap.  If that little surfer girl in Hawaii that got her arms bitten off by the shark, she tells  a little story about how she sewed a button on her little bikini, there you go.  Or if Colby Bryan says, hey, I had a button, but it got torn off in a rape, you'll understand  how it happens.  Yeah, Colby.  Yeah.  There you go.  All right, that would make more sense.  That deserves an applause break.  Here's another Tony Danza cheap applause break during his show yesterday. 
[02:30:30]  Oh, how about bad news?  You hear the bad news?  Uh-oh.  The ABC's off the Miss America pageant.  Yeah.  Pageant.  All they were doing was crying on the show.  They were crying all the time.  The models were crying.  The models were crying.  The models were in tears.  I think it's because they're starving.  Oh, my God.  What a Rupert Pupkin delivery.  But here's...  I get very clanky when I don't eat.  Me too.  The worst part of that is not even his awful joke. 
[02:31:00]  It's his awful assistant, whatever that hole is, who says, what, what, the models?  Who else could he possibly be talking about?  You trying to be a straight man.  Yeah.  All right.  Jimmy's back with us.  All right.  You scared me for a second there.  Well, I don't want to be so predictable.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I'd throw up.  But did you catch that when you...  He's like, yeah, they're... 
[02:31:30]  Why they're so cranky?  Why they're crying all the time?  Oh, the models?  Yeah.  The models?  Yeah.  This is what they want on TV.  What can I tell you?  Here's another cheap applause break.  Well, I go to better hotels than you.  All right.  He goes to better hotels than his hole.  They're applauding hotels.  Better hotels.  The fact that he gets comped into better hotels. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah.  They're applauding the fact that he gets good free stuff.  What are you writing down, Steve?  You're jotting vigorously.  Steve?  Uh, Jim was asking what the assistant's name is.  Yes.  It's, uh, Erica Vitrini from the...  Yeah!  Steve C, everyone.  That's funny.  What?  I think we are...  Of course, they're hungry!  I get cranky when I don't eat. 
[02:32:30]  What about this?  You know what?  They're crying all the time.  Who, the models?  Yeah, and I'm thinking maybe because they were raped as teenagers.  We're going to have applause breaks on our show from now on.  We really should.  Why not?  Seems to work.  Oh, wow.  We're going to debut the FU line, finally.  Three weeks into the brand new O&A show.  We wanted this the first day, but three weeks later is pretty good. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah, we got some calls.  We farmed out some calls.  Got the audio.  Would you?  Ben, why are you laughing?  I just love how Jim looks at Steve every day and evaluates Steve's appearance.  It's hilarious.  You don't like his bowling shirt?  Kind of a bowling shirt.  Oh, that awful black shirt with the nice big white stripe down the side.  It's hideous.  I just sit and look at Jim criticizing me.  I know I'm awful.  It's like, hello, pot, I'm kettle kind of thing.  And Jim, you wore that sweatshirt yesterday. 
[02:33:30]  He wears it every day.  It's like a coat.  Yeah, that's a little chilly in New York.  It's cold, so I work.  All right, here's a – want to do just one more applause break?  No, I want to do a few more.  And he plays a game, too?  Yeah, that's the last applause break you got queued up.  And then there's a game, a trivia game with a caller from the Midwest somewhere.  That's the next round.  And why do we want to play that?  I don't know.  It's on there if you want to play it.  Thank you, Steve.  There he goes.  Martini Steve, everyone.  Why'd you cut your sleeves off?  Did the cufflink keep dipping into the booze and soaking it up? 
[02:34:00]  It's Friday.  Steve will be drinking martinis today.  He reached over his drink, and his sleeve dipped in, and that little bit of alcohol was lost,  so he just tore the sleeves on all of his shirts.  The light bulb was dinged over his head, and he realized,  I could rip these sleeves off and not waste any more booze.  This way I won't have to squeeze the shirt sleeve into my mouth to get that drop.  All right, here's the last Tony Danza applause break for today. 
[02:34:30]  We'll bring this back from time to time.  I think every day.  He's doing it every day.  Yeah.  By the way, we have Carolyn.  Carolyn and George here next week, too.  Speaking of boardroom.  What?  Wow.  Not quite a cheap applause break.  It's one of those, you know, announce the guest thing.  I just don't like doing that.  Why?  I don't know.  Okay.  But speaking of boardroom, he should be talking about his own audience.  That is a boardroom.  B-O-R-E-D, though.  Not B-O-A-R-D.  That's fantastic. 
[02:35:00]  That's funny.  I used to rate Mary Lou Henner on the set.  Oh, that told me.  Danny DeVito's so short, he could suck my cock standing up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What?  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  XM 202.  Yeah, I think diabetes. 
[02:35:30]  This is great.  It was unbelievable.  Hey, look.  Natalie Cole, Beyonce, and Halle Berry.  I made out with all three of those women.  You know, I don't know if you know,  this has been my dream to have Sidney Fortier come here  and sit here and talk to me.  And I'm wearing him down.  I'm telling you, I can tell.  You can tell. 
[02:36:00]  My 11-year-old was elected to the student council.  I hope she gets assassinated.  Little bitch.  Little twat.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Enough.  Some of the applause breaks from Tony Danza's show yesterday.  We're obsessed with the Tony Danza show.  That audience must just walk out with chopped meat bloodied hands.  Oh, we got to clap at everything.  That stupid Dago. 
[02:36:30]  Everything he says.  Shut up.  We have to clap.  You dullard.  Why do they keep turning on that applause sign?  Oh, God.  He's not saying anything, but they're making us applause.  It's like a special child doing something.  You know, whatever they do, you got to applaud it.  And he's quite the retard himself.  Oh, look.  He smiled.  Yeah.  I'm trying to string a sentence together.  Oh, Tony.  Hey, Tony.  He did it.  Takes words and puts them together and almost conveys an idea. 
[02:37:00]  He's cute.  Then I took my golden glove's fist and put it right in Judd Hirsch's Jew nose.  Oh, Tony.  Come on.  He means it good-naturedly.  That show is like a goof.  Like somebody said, let me see how awful a show I can put together.  Oh, you just picture the guys in the pitch meeting.  Guys, listen.  We get this idiot, this blithering idiot on television to work a talk show.  It's like those reality shows where the person doesn't know he's in a reality show. 
[02:37:30]  Who can we get?  Who's the biggest retard in Hollywood that we can get to do this?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Guys, it's Tony Danza, everyone.  We'll prop him up in front of a camera, give him a little side kick, and he could do a talk show.  He'll actually think he's doing a talk show, but we'll all be laughing at him.  I saw that show when it was called Rosie O'Donnell.  Yeah, before she turned into a big bull dyke, she was doing this.  It's the whole good-natured appeal to the Midwest women, the rubes, who remember watching them in taxi. 
[02:38:00]  Hey, Riga, I'm taking Camp 5.  Hey, there you go.  That's great.  I remember that.  Well, we found a website.  One of our listeners, you know, the listeners are a part of this radio show.  We call it the People's Radio Show, and they help us with show prep, which means...  That sounds communist, but I like it.  I know.  The People's Radio Show.  You know, that means we don't have to work as hard. 
[02:38:30]  There you go.  The key to Anthony and I is to work less and become bigger.  Work less, become bigger, more gooder.  More gooder.  Right.  So one of our fine fans turned us on to the Tony Danza website, where they just mocked the TV show.  Yeah.  They put together a bunch of clips.  Yeah, there's all sorts of sections, like Tony talks about things we don't care about.  And here's a couple examples.  My daughter's a big reader, my Emily.  In fact, she got 100 on her reading test yesterday.  Congratulations, Emmy.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:39:00]  He's telling people that his daughter got 100 on her reading test.  Like anyone cares.  And the Post, the Sunday Post gave this show a great rating.  Post, who cares?  You know what that show needs?  You remember in Scarface, when that big fat thing is dancing on the stage, and those two  guys open up with semi-automatic weapons?  That's what the Tony Danza audience needs.  A little gunfire.  Tony's standing there, and they're shooting at his knees. 
[02:39:30]  We'll be back after these words.  I'm being shot.  Angela.  Here's another example.  Tony talking about things we don't care about.  By the way, for those of you watching Friday, my daughter had her SAT Saturday, and the feeling  is, in a little update, the feeling is she felt really well about how it went.  Yay.  So I'm very happy about that.  Go, Katie.  And I hope all the other kids that took the test also did well, you know. 
[02:40:00]  My daughter got laid for the first time.  It was her prom last night, and her legs were akimbo in the back of the limo.  She came home all stretched out with a little blood on her prom dress.  Yeah, so I'm very happy she's entered the world of sex.  It's great.  What a tool.  He really is a boob.  My daughter passed his her essay, whatever that gender is.  I don't even know what it is.  A guy, a girl, I'm wacky. 
[02:40:30]  Just these, it's nothing but uninteresting tidbits followed by hands hitting each other.  It stinks.  Dribble, I think they call it.  Dribble.  I wish everybody else a little luck.  Wow, that was genuine.  Everything's good-natured.  We hope everyone's life is fine and dandy.  You got a smile early in the morning.  Yeah, of course.  Laugh in the world, laugh with you.  The applause break.  The applause break makes me physically ill. 
[02:41:00]  You know when you should get an applause break where you're like,  so I was out with this chick and she wouldn't talk to me.  I poured something in her drink.  Next thing you know, she's passed out and I'm banging her.  That should get the applause break.  I went to dinner with my daughter's last night and the waitress spilled my coffee.  So I dumped the hot coffee on her tits.  It was amazing.  She screamed and then I punched her in the face.  Where is that?  I got too many freaking CDs here.  I love this guy. 
[02:41:30]  Oh, it's just, what an ass.  It's so funny when you put it that way, Jim, that it's like a goof.  Like somebody put together a goof of a talk show.  Well, this website is hilarious.  There's another section on the Tony Danza website where they just goofed the show.  He likes to say hearts, thoughts, and prayers.  Oh, this is his insincere shout-outs.  Pretty much every morning he likes to do these hearts, thoughts, and prayers.  These are shout-outs to people that have had tragedy in their life. 
[02:42:00]  Right.  Yes.  And he wants those people to know that my hearts and prayers and thoughts are with all these people.  And it's so insincere because he says the same thing no matter what happened to these people.  They're dead.  They're hurricane.  They're this.  They're that.  Same, same line.  Well, Sex Bagel put a little montage together of all his hearts, thoughts, and prayers.  Yeah, this isn't a loop.  These are different times that he says the same thing.  I thought I sort of, oh, sorry. 
[02:42:30]  Oh, my God.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to step on the cue.  My thoughts and prayers are with Jim Norton.  Yeah, tripping on the word.  Tripping all over that one.  I really, I heard like a moment of this before.  I really thought that they had looped the same thing over.  I didn't realize these were different clips.  That's how awful he is.  I thought it was the same clip.  You can't even tell.  Disingenuous idiot.  There it is.  Look, here in the USA Today, the two big stories.  Ivan, this crazy hurricane.  Crazy.  Oh, it's crazy.  It's spinning all around and around.  I don't think it has any thought as to what it's doing. 
[02:43:00]  It's wearing a goofy hat.  It's crazy.  It's wacky.  It was wearing clown makeup.  Right.  What a crazy hurricane.  Spinning around in its clown makeup, picking up boys, tying them up and strangling them in  Chicago.  Crazy hurricane.  Look, here in the USA Today, the two big stories.  Ivan, this crazy hurricane.  My gosh.  So our thoughts and our prayers and our hearts go out to everybody down in Pensacola and Alabama. 
[02:43:30]  I mean, yeah, Alabama and Louisiana and Nebraska, the hurricane capital of the U.S., Nebraska and  Colorado, the Rocky Mountains.  There's a lot of hurricanes.  Any state that ends in a hay that has incest in it, just the blood for them.  What is it, Alabama, Pensacola, and our own capital city of Saskatchewan is having problems  with the hurricane.  It's a crazy zany hurricane.  Our hearts and our prayers go out to you, Jamie, and your family. 
[02:44:00]  They were killed the other night, and so our thoughts and prayers go out to their families.  My heart, liver, and kidneys go out.  Over and over again.  Can we point out that the hearts and prayers should probably go out before the deaths you  answer?  Yeah.  It doesn't help once they're in a box.  Not if you're dead.  My heart's prayers and a casket, okay?  Can we have our show sponsor a casket?  The Danza casket?  We'll have it put on the side while he's planted. 
[02:44:30]  Colleagues, before I get started, just on a serious note, you know, that hurricane, Ivan,  it hit Pensacola pretty hard, so we're, you know, we send out our thoughts and our  prayers to the people on the Gulf Coast.  The Pepsi-Cola, Coca-Cola, 7-Up, all of them are devastated from the, what, Pepsi-Cola?  Where was it?  You dolt.  I gotta go back now.  Hold on.  We're going backwards a little bit.  Their colleagues.  Before I get started, just on a serious note, you know, that hurricane, Ivan, it hit Pensacola 
[02:45:00]  pretty hard, so we're, you know, we send out our thoughts and our prayers to the people  on the Gulf Coast, especially in Pensacola, because it was pretty devastating.  And anyway, and also, we want to send our thoughts and our prayers out to Rodney Dangerfield.  You know, he's in a, he's in a coma, but he's supposed to be doing better, which I'm trying  to figure out.  Yeah, he's in a coma, and that's great, everybody.  A hand for him.  That's great.  Coma.  A blood for a coma.  Because I've been in a coma for years, and they put, I'm doing a talk show, so apparently 
[02:45:30]  it's not all that bad.  I think it's all the blows to the head when you were a fighter doing the golden gloves.  But I think, you know, we, you know, our hearts and our prayers, and one other thing, another  hurricane for Florida, so our prayers and our thoughts go out to the Florida people.  He was always an inspiration, and we send our thoughts and prayers to his family and  all his fans, because he was really one of the good guys.  I'm sorry about that.  These Florida people.  The last one was.  I just caught that to the Florida people. 
[02:46:00]  The Florida people.  What an adult.  Another hurricane.  It's like these things, just, who keeps making them?  They're crazy.  They're crazy.  They just keep coming back with different names.  It is unbearably awful.  Let Hurricane Tony come in and sweep your mind away.  Yeah.  Huh?  You pasta-headed idiot.  Hurricane Tony just blows Down Syndrome all over the place, and you hear the sound of hand  clapping as you get dumber and dumber. 
[02:46:30]  Here it comes.  Board up your windows.  And then there's a section on this website called The Real Tony Danza.  The Real Tony Danza.  This is a little hint of his actual personality show through.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Pop out a little bit.  I want you to know something.  I think we should make one of each, a man and a woman, because I think the women are due  to win tonight.  They're due.  I hope so.  Well, is the cameraman just going to keep talking, or should I, uh...  He's got a pick. 
[02:47:00]  I'm losing the stage, folks.  A little uncomfortable laughter there.  He was serious.  Yeah, everybody.  I'm all good natured and stuff.  Hey, fucking asshole.  Shut up, or I'll punch your face in, all right?  My daughter, we got an A on her test.  It's great.  If she didn't, I'd have hit the teacher in the twat.  I swear I'd have punched the right knee ovaries.  You know, another thing.  I'm on a roll.  Okay.  Keep it coming.  Keep it coming.  What else? 
[02:47:30]  You want to talk about something?  Tell me.  Where are you going tonight?  What's the event?  Oh, I don't care.  50 hollies?  No, I'm kidding.  That's how he feels.  He realizes he's aassy.  You could tell.  You could tell what he's really like.  Let's see.  What else?  That's it?  I'm done?  You're telling me I have to move on?  I have to...  What?  Go ahead.  What?  No.  It's my show when it's live.  Tough.  Oh, you know what he's probably like at home.  Awful.  Oh, man.  I'm feeling pretty good, I gotta tell you.  Oh. 
[02:48:00]  So, I don't know.  It goes on and on.  Where's the closing song?  I was listening to that one last time.  What closing song?  You got that?  I never got that far in the show.  He sings a little tune.  Oh, this...  He sings a little tune at the end of the show.  Well, there's a whole category of Tony sings.  Ugh.  What the hell's going on out there?  You hear that?  I don't know.  The cameraman's talking.  Hey, the cameraman's talking.  Woo!  Hey, Elmo's back to sing Monster in the Mirror, and we have some of these friends.  Oh, no, he's singing with Elmo. 
[02:48:30]  He really is Rosie O'Donnell.  So, a monster in the mirror will never wake up today.  Oh, my God.  A monster in the mirror, but Elmo would not run away.  I would get no share I care.  I'm listening to his bed.  Told a monster looked at Elmo, and it's just what he said.  He said, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Oh, no.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  I don't do what he do.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  So, I say it too.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
[02:49:00]  Do not wobble me, or I will wobble you.  Do not wobble, wobble, wobble.  My wobble broke, and I got a daughter.  She does well on the SAT.  So, the mother in the mirror, no, I am not scared.  Go scared.  Then I smiled at him, and thanked him for the song that he had shared.  Let's go.  The mother thanked me too.  He smiled right back, and then the mother in the mirror sang his song again.  Yes.  He said, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa. 
[02:49:30]  Look, I didn't need to do.  Oh.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Turn it off.  Do not wobble you, or I will wobble you.  Do not wobble, wobble, I will wobble you.  We'll be right back, folks.  I would have more respect for that song if it was called 
[02:50:00]  There's a Monster in My Rain  That was horrendous  There's a monster in my rain  And I'm sucking  Wubba, Wubba, Wubba  Wubba, Wubba, Wubba  There he is  Here's another singing sample  A little ditty  Okay, let me explain what it is  See, I hosted the Miss America pageant, but I'm bitter  I'm bitter because I didn't get to sing the song  So I was wondering if I could just  Are you going to sing the song for me?  I just want to  Oh, brother  Because, you know, I don't mind hearing it again  If I could just give you this 
[02:50:30]  And if you'll take a walk down our red carpet  I would love to do that  And I'll do it  Wonderful  Okay  Yeah, there you go  There she is  Miss America  There she is  Your ideal  With hundreds of beauties  She'll take the town by storm  With her all-American  He's showcasing his talent  And there she is

Yeah  It's this forced manufactured charm  It's like, look at how cute I can be doing something I know I'm not too good at 
[02:51:30]  But I'm a freewheeling spirit  Look, I'm trying real hard  Just good-naturedly having fun  And it's unbearably awful  That's what America wants to watch on TV, though, bro  That is true  It's getting ratings  It's getting ratings  And it's getting great reviews  You know what he is to Italians?  Like step and fetch it is to black people  Like Sambo  Like little black Sambo is to black people  Like a big, fat Aunt Jemima  With the thing on her head  That's what it is

Oh, of course  I love hoofing like Sammy  I know, but I thought you should have been him for Halloween  Well, I actually, I went with the Spider-Man, did you see?  I didn't like that  I didn't like it either  I needed an apron to cover that up  You know what I'm talking about, huh?  I know what you're talking about  Hey, Tony Danza junk hanging out all over the place  No, that was not for anybody to see  No, not for public consumption, huh?  No, I don't like those outfits

I have no clue  I have  When we were at Regis  I bought my CD in  And you said being I was the only person  That had your CD in the audience  You came over and you signed it  And I think that's how you should open the show  Rather than do the silly stuff  Oh, you don't like the silly stuff?  No, I like that you honored your father  When you came in on the garbage truck

Of course Tony did  Yeah 
[03:14:00]  Of course  Alright  Okay  Alright  They're just reiterating to me  You know what to do during the extrava danza  When the graphic comes up  Because he loves giving it out of the way  Other people's money  You know that, right?  So when he does extrava danza  Graphics go up  And she's up there doing the Plinko thing  You know what to do, right?

Okay, we're good  Alright, thank you, Eric 
[03:14:30]  We'll see you in a little while  Bye  Holy ass  Oh, if I'm watching that later  And this broad does this  I'm going to crap myself  That's just too easy  I will crap myself  They just are so thrilled to death  That they are talking with Tony Danza  That he can say anything to these people  Anything  Alright  Wow  That was so funny  Oh, please God  Let that work  Greg from Bloomfield  Oh man, you jerk-offs  Are going to force me to watch  That fucking Tony Danza show now 
[03:15:00]  Well, I hope it works  It's an experiment  We'll see  It will eventually  Eventually it will work  Absolutely  If we have to send the intern out  With a Tony Danza shirt  We have to have a Tony Danza shirt made  Who doesn't want one?  Well, you know  I'd like one too  One with him in a Spider-Man suit  With that luscious hog  That was funny  Alright, well  Wrap in  That was great  Here it comes  That was really good  Another successful Tony Danza phone call 
[03:15:30]  Can't lose  They love Tony  He was just the boy next door  Mikey, where are you?  It's the game for kids  That's sweeping the country  Give me, what are you doing?  Jesus, it's Christ  My little babies  Monster Rain  Monster Rain  The game you play  Under the porch  Monster Rain  We had Eric Logan come into town 
[03:16:00]  And give us a little pep talk  Little pep talk  Sat right here in the studio  Because our office isn't done  He really doesn't know  Who he's dealing with  He's giving us a little pep talk  And using all this corporate lingo  Anthony and I are looking at each other  Going  What?  Nothing against Eric  But I nodded off twice  I was scared  I was going to snore  And it's nothing  I mean anyone could be in here  Tony Danza could be in here 
[03:16:30]  With all his thrill  And okay  Maybe I should pick someone else  Well the applause would wake you  Right  But I was  Twice  I found myself  Opening my eyes  And going  Oh my god  How long was I out?  Twice I did it  And then I had to like  Get up, lean forward  And contribute something  To the meeting  Well I had a lot of analogies  The two bucket thing  A lot of corporate analogy talk  Yeah  Yeah two buckets  One of the things we can control  One of the things we can't control  Let's look at what we can do 
[03:17:00]  With this bucket  It was the worst  It sunk in on you though Jimmy  You remember it  Yeah let's fill up the bucket  With the things we can control  There are some things we can't control  And those just have to be put aside  Perhaps later they will go into the  We can control it bucket  But right now they're in the bucket  Of things we can't control  There's this other bucket  That's empty over here  And that's the things that we can control  See one bucket has Jimmy's plummeting T-cell count  Those are things we can't control  And then the other one  There's condoms and things  That he could have used  Right 
[03:17:30]  Those are things we can control  Right  I don't care what bucket you use Mr. Logan  Just get me one  I want to throw up  That's the worst thing I've ever heard in my life  One bucket has snot  That a girl by Jimmy's bed  Has been puking up into  It was hilarious  Oh he just had all the corporate lingo  And then the analogy he made  I think we're just not used to people  Caring about our show  And trying to bring us to the next level  We're used to just being our own bosses  So we just do what we do  And I think he's trying to maybe  Not control but try to push us forward 
[03:18:00]  Contribute a little bit  A little  To his credit I think he just wants to  Try to push us forward  With this radio show  Help out  Now that we're feeling a little more comfortable  We're starting to move the show forward  Right  He made an analogy between the Yankees Red Sox  Which every corporate guy does  In a meeting  You always take the topical event  And spin it into an analogy  That you could use to make your point  And Jimmy was not buying this analogy  I'm sitting here  And that I think is what woke me up too 
[03:18:30]  Is because Jimmy just was fighting this analogy  To the nail  Because it was  I forget exactly how he worded it  But it was like  He absolutely made my point  Without meaning to  Right  He was talking about  Obviously  You know  Sirius and XM  And just you know  How you look at one  And he's like  Well  I mean the Red Sox won this year  Because they weren't thinking about the Yankees  They were just going out to win  Meaning we should worry about us  And I said  No  The Red Sox won  Because all they thought about  Was the Yankees  And they built that team  To beat the Yankees  That's why they got shilling 
[03:19:00]  And he's like  Well yeah  But this is different  Because we're kind of in mid-season  That was the worst  And I asked  What happens if there's a rain delay  And it completely screwed everyone up  I started bringing a tarp out onto the studio  Because I thought it was going to rain  The ump made a lousy call  And all of a sudden  We don't have an office  And we don't even have a porch to run under  And if we're going to go with this baseball analogy  How about you build our stadium  So we can play ball  Right  How about our  Where's our stadium?  We're stuck here in the dugout 
[03:19:30]  We don't even have a field to play on  We're still in the dugout  Our office is a mess  There's securities chasing an oompa loompa  Around the bases  How did he get on the field?  Eric's sitting there with his bloody sock  Trying to make things okay  So it was a nice rah-rah speech  And the first email I got  Right after the meeting was  Oh guys  You will not have a production studio  For the rest of the week  Yeah thank you  So there you go  I thought we were  That's going to help us push the show forward  I thought we were moving forward  All of a sudden  Eric comes in and says 
[03:20:00]  Guys we can't edit anything  We can't produce anything  For the next four or five days  And they said because  The studio is down  Yeah  The studio is down  There's no office  But you know  We've got to move our game forward  Okay  Well there's some good suggestions  About maybe for the election  Just go on live  Jesus you  That was a good one  I like that one  Jimmy just has to say this  Why?  Yes there was a suggestion made  That perhaps  But I'm not sure  If this was a literal suggestion  I believe it was just 
[03:20:30]  It showed the ability  That this program has  To go on for any event  So he brought up one  Yeah let me just set it up  Really fast  Because we run this channel  This 202  This high voltage  That we're still trying  To change the name of  It's all ours  Toots  Another thing that's not  Going anywhere  We want the channel  To be Opie and Anthony's virus  Or something that makes sense  But anyway  We run this channel  Yes  So he wants us to start  Looking at opportunities  To just kind of pop on  At other times of the day  And do things  For events  Which we definitely want to do 
[03:21:00]  When we feel more comfortable  With this radio show  And they can also  He said  Be opened up  To the general population  Of subscribers  On XM  Right  Instead of just the premium  Subscribers  If we did some kind of  Specialty program  They could open it up  And give it out to everybody  And turn everyone on  To the Opie and Anthony show  Right  So one suggestion  That was made  I think it was a random thing  Maybe off the top of his head  Okay  Was that we do  An election coverage show 
[03:21:30]  On election eve  Opie  Next Tuesday  Next Tuesday  We come in here  At maybe 7 o'clock at night  Stay till midnight  And do a whole rundown  Of the election  Okay  That suggestion  Made my back hurt  It's  First  Is anybody going to be  Look  I know the election  Is tonight  Or tomorrow morning  Let's just flip through  Randomly and see  If the block  Has been taken off  Any channels  And anyone's doing  A particular program  No one would hear it  Three people would hear it  And that's including us  The election coverage 
[03:22:00]  I believe it would be better  If we did it  In front of a giant Pop-Tart  Could you imagine  Now why didn't he bring that up  We could have a big map  With the election coverage  On the Pop-Tart  The red states  And the blue states  Oh could you imagine that  Jimmy  Let's throw it over to you  And maybe producer Ben  Could tell me  He's not going on  To the election trail  So I could pull little pins  Out of the map  As I cry  Let's go to Ben  For what precincts  Have checked in already  With the election results  With 98% of the precincts 
[03:22:30]  Reporting in  We can absolutely report  That George W. Bush  Seems to be the winner  Nice try Kerry  Oh that would be  A great show  Yeah and we could just  Stay till midnight  And do a whole wrap up  Of the election  It would be like that  Mary Tyler Moore episode  When they have to stay  For election coverage  Because the machine  That was really good  Talking to the priest  And he's talking to the janitor  Till four in the morning  You see 
[03:23:00]  There's a bucket of things  We can control  Mary Murr  Dip into the bucket of things  We can control  You know the Red Sox  Because they didn't  Concentrate on the Yankees  It's easy to grin  When your bucket comes in  Spalding  We're doing election coverage today  And you got the election beat  You'll vote for Kerry and like it  How about a fresca 
[03:23:30]  Danny  How many precincts  Are reported in Danny  You're no gentleman  Hey I'm no candidate either  Alright  Oh that just  Oh  What a meeting  What a meeting  I did notice some blood  On my ankle  During the meeting  My ankle spontaneously bled  My tendon came out of its sheath  And speaking of buckets  I hope you're slipping one 
[03:24:00]  Filled with you know what  Jesus  He's our boss  He's attempting to be our first boss  Give him a shot  I was old Sammy Snooze  Oh you really were  I was dozing in the chair  What a narcoleptic ass  We just don't do well 
[03:24:30]  With meetings  Never have  A meeting would not have classified  As an extravidanza  It's just awful  But like I said again  It might sound like I'm kissing ass  But nothing against Eric  It's pretty much  You know  I remember being in meetings  With Ken Stevens  Over there at Infinity  Same thing  I can't stay awake  Not really  During meeting  Eric didn't have  It's not the same meeting  Because Eric didn't have  His bags packed  And yelling and screaming 
[03:25:00]  That he was quitting  He's quitting as our boss  Poor Ken  He should have quit  He should have quit  He should have quit on us  He maybe still had a career  He would have got his severance  At least  Instead of being out  On a little sailboat  Out there in D.C.  Whatever he's doing these days  Poor guy  We love him  Eric take a close look  At where Ken Stevens  Is right now  And just be careful  Alright  Tends to happen  So we're making the show  More gooder  More gooder  By closing down  Our production studio  For a week  Right 
[03:25:30]  Why is it closed down  By the way  If I could ask  Well they're upgrading  That seems like something  You should do on a weekend  But they're  You know  They're upgrading  The facility  Nah you better off  Doing that Tuesday through Friday  Because you're not going to need us  Yes you are  You're better off  By the way  Tuesday or Friday  Remember when I said  That all these cubicles  Will be gone  Yep  Yeah  I remember  That's happening  We win  We won  We're taking over  This whole facility  We're going to have  The entire floor  Yeah  We won  So all those cubicles  Go  Room for pinball machines  And foosball tables  Yes  And Jägermeister machines 
[03:26:00]  A full bar  A green room  A lounge  A recording area  No place for bands to play  Oh yeah man  Opie  Anthony  Dance party weekend  Wait wait wait  Na na na  Na na  The Opie and Anthony show  Comedy gone too far  When my wife and I  First moved to California  She was hammering on me  By going on one of these  Whale watching trips  Let's get in the boat  And go see the whales  Let's go see the whales  I'm like no 
[03:26:30]  It's a 60 foot animal  We're in a 6 foot rubber boat  We're a bath toy  No  Well she finally  Talked me into going  She didn't talk me into going  She just said  You're going  I said hey  Sounds good  So the day of the trip  I'm just whining and moaning  I don't want to go  And we're going with these  Two other California  Couple friends of ours  Who were nice people  But one of the guys  Like one of these surfer guys  He doesn't have a job  I don't know what he does  But he thinks I'm his friend  Because I cut him down  So we get down on the docks 
[03:27:00]  And this guy is like  Right in my face  Like Bill  Dude  Alright  Listen up  Do you know  What would like  Totally make my day  I'm like  A GED  Is that a band  Dude  If we were out in that boat  Alright  This would be so righteous  If we were out in that boat  And a whale went  Right by the boat  Just jump right by the boat  That would make my day  I go  Do you know what would make my day  A gun barrel in my mouth  So we get out in this boat 
[03:27:30]  And surf boy  Gets his wish  Out of nowhere  This humongous whale  Comes up right by the boat  And goes  And sprays this nasty liquid  All over the boat  And the Californians  Are freaking  They're like  Oh my god  He sprayed us  That is so cool  I'm like  Hello  He just blew his nose  On us  Is what he did  We just paid  200 bucks apiece 
[03:28:00]  To have a whale  Honk a loogie on us  That's all we did  You know what  Give me the 200 bucks  And then the whale  Made a noise  It went like  And they lost it  They're screaming  What do you say  What do you say  What do you say  I'm like  He said  That's what he said  Which means  I just blew snot  On him  And go tell my friends  I'm just getting  On my nerves  And it ain't really  The tellers 
[03:28:30]  I'm just doing my job  Sir  I am just doing my job  Well you're sucking  At it lady  I'll say that  Well I've been  In Amoco all night  And here now  I'm here working  At the bank  In my other job  I bounced a check  For three dollars  Charged me 30 bucks  For a three dollar check  Now if I ain't got three  I damn sure  Ain't got 33  This just don't make  A whole lot of sense  To me  I had a bank  In Atlanta  Charge you three dollars 
[03:29:00]  To check the balance  In your savings account  In other words  You walk in  And go  How much money  I got in this account  Oh three hundred dollars  Well two ninety seven  So what you're saying  Is if I ask you  Another ninety nine times  How much money I got  I'll be broke  Before you go to lunch  That's what you're saying  It's a sorry world  One hundred channels  Of crystal clear  Digital audio  XM satellite radio  Radio to the power of X  Here's Opie and Anthony 
[03:29:30]  When they're not awful  Okay terrific  The worst  Of Opie and Anthony  No more of that  It's bad for you  You know what  Keeps us awake though  All the corporate lingo  Yeah  Oh it's hilarious  We've already  You know goofed on  On the phone yesterday  It's like okay  Bucket analogy  Yeah we got this idea  Let me tee it up for you  Yeah teeing it up  Let me tee it up for you  I'll tell you  Tee this up for you  And then we'll  It's like you're teeing it up  Getting ready to slam it  And the other one is 
[03:30:00]  We'll circle back around on that  Whatever that means  I don't know what that means  We're going to circle back around  Which means nothing gets done  It just keeps going in circles  And circles  And circles  Run it through the mill  One more time  We're going to circle around  Before we decide on that  Well yesterday  We're talking about this  Possible like demanding  Christmas show  Or something  It's very primitive right now  We got to try to  Figure something out  And all of a sudden  Was it Kevin?  I'm not sure who said it  One of the guys goes  Well before we blue sky that  Yeah  We're going to talk about it  You know 
[03:30:30]  We'll run it around  A few times  Before we blue sky it  Blue sky it  What the hell is that mean?  And if I wasn't completely exhausted  I just kind of went  Anthony and I had a  20 minute conversation  On the phone last night  Trying to figure out  What blue sky it means  What blue sky?  Like it's a corporate term  And I'm thinking  It's some kind of jet analogy  Like you take off  And like  And it's cloudy  And it takes a while  To get up above the clouds  Before you hit the blue sky  The blue sky?  And then it's clear sailing 
[03:31:00]  You sure it wasn't  Blue guy?  Maybe a promo for this show?  Yeah  That might be it  So before we blue sky  Our ONA Twisted  Or Demented Christmas show  We're going to  Attempt to do live  On XM Satellite Radio  I think it's  We've got to wait for them  To blue sky it  Whatever that means  I think it's when  You're done with something  When everything's figured out  And it's completed  Like if you're in a factory  And you're building something  Like a car  Or something  It rolls off the assembly line  And then out the door  Now it's under the blue sky 
[03:31:30]  Like when you  You have an idea  And then you  You run with it  You fix it  You have your meetings about it  Now you're ready to put it out there  Into the  Into the  The outdoors  The blue sky  Your blue sky  I like my jet analogy better  Yeah but what if your jet  Takes off on a clear day  It's blue sky  Right from the start  Sure is  You're still not up in the blue sky though  You still have to  You know  There's blue sky  Under the runway  But you still have to climb  You're climbing up  You're figuring it out  You're figuring out  What altitude to fly at  I think you're looking  Too deep into it 
[03:32:00]  And then you  Even out that plane  And you're off and running  I think you're looking  Too deep into the blue sky thing  Your pen  OCD alert  It just flew over by the monitor  OCD alert  Nah you don't need it  Just forget about it  Don't even think about it  It's over there  Just put it over there  It's under the  There you go  Just don't tap it  All is right with the world  Oh my god  Yeah he's crazy like that  If he lost that pen  He'd be looking for it  I got a little OCD crap  It's little  It's little stuff  Anyway  Yeah so the blue sky thing  Yeah  We're going to try to blue sky 
[03:32:30]  This Christmas party  Corporate lingo stinks  There's got to be a website  For corporate lingo  I looked up some last night  Yeah  You did?  Yeah  It wasn't all that good  Not as good as the ones  They make up in Washington  What's the site  www.boringdouche.com  The best one though  Is the whole  I'm going to tee this up for you  Tee it up  I'm going to tee up  This idea for you  They like that one  We're going to tee it up  We're going to try to hit this  Down the fairway  It might be a big slice though  Might hit the trap  Or God forbid 
[03:33:00]  It ends up in the water  Didn't use enough club  But he's teeing it up for us  He's teeing it up  You know something  When you have meetings  With anyone involved  With the Opie and Anthony show  You can refrain  From using the corporate lingo  You really can  I understand it might fly well  With another big corporation  You're having a meeting with  Or a client perhaps  If you want them to buy  The show or something  But when you're dealing  With people from this show  All we do  Is laugh at it  And discuss it  When we hang up with you  On the phone  Right  It's not something 
[03:33:30]  Where we're like  Yeah let's blue sky  We don't take the lingo in  And start using it  Aside from goofing on it  Right  So you can really refrain  From the corporate lingo  Yeah when you talk to us  Use the word dude a lot  That's fine  Or hey ass  Hey  Right  Ass  Something like that  Yeah we're gonna  You know  Let's bring it down a notch  How about  Let's discuss the idea  And when we're ready  We'll put it out there  You got the list?  I have a list  Of some corporate lingo  Alright give us a few here  Drill down 
[03:34:00]  Drill down  That's for someone  To examine something  In detail  Feature by feature  Regardless of level  Of management  Oh my god  There was another one  Recently  Really  That was told to us  What was it?  That hasn't  When they're like  Making deals  XM Satellite Radio  Making deals  Every single day  Yeah  And we hear about  Some of these deals  They may be making  Yeah  But they don't want us  To talk about it yet  Because it hasn't  What?  Fill in the blank 
[03:34:30]  It was one of the  Classic ones we heard  Recently  They're working on a deal  They don't want us  To talk about it  Because it hasn't  Yet  Oh oh oh  Damn I can't remember  I keep thinking like  Incubated or something  Baked  Baked  It still hasn't  Baked  It still hasn't been baked  That made me  Physically ill  I swear to god  We heard that one  From a lawyer lady  They're working on something  But we can't talk about it yet  Because it hasn't baked yet  You know what it is 
[03:35:00]  Corporate people  Are trying so hard  I know what that means  What?  The deal hasn't been signed  Hasn't baked yet  How about we've been  We've been working on that  Offline  Oh we've heard offline  Offline  Offline  A term meaning  At another unspecified meeting  Suggesting that an uncomfortable  Or technically complex topic  Be taken offline  Is an excellent way  To put off  Its further discussion  Indefinitely  Put that offline  Take that offline  Oh this stuff  Makes me nauseous  We've got a guy  That knows what blue sky is 
[03:35:30]  Oh he does?  I think so  Peter in Jersey  Hey what's up guys  Hey  First let me tell you guys  You guys rock man  I've been listening to you guys  Since you guys were on  NEW from the early days  Thank you my friend  It's funny because  I'm listening to this  And I'm a regional sales manager  With a small company  Out of North Carolina  And I gotta deal with  These stupid bullshit terms  All the time  And everybody always wants  The blue sky  Any idea we ever started  Basically what it is  It's what they want to do 
[03:36:00]  They just want to  It's almost like  Taking a white piece of paper  They want a blue sky  Like when you paint a picture  You gotta start with a blue sky  Before you put anything else on it  So they want to start from nothing  And like build it from  Oh  Now that's something  We didn't see coming  Nice  So it's starting from scratch  We're gonna blue sky it  And just plan from there  Exactly  And it drives me nuts  We got this bitch  Regional sales manager  From the Midwest  Who wants to blue sky  Every idea that comes up  Well let's blue sky it 
[03:36:30]  I want to fucking strangle  You know what this is all about  I mean these corporate people  Their jobs are very boring  You know  And they're trying to  You know  Throw some excitement into it  You know  But the fact is  It's just boring  It's black or white  That's what their jobs are  It's just black or white  They don't want to be  The boars that they are  Right  So  That's it  I'm a 34 year old  Regional sales manager  That was in Mulcahy  10 years ago  And I don't  You know  I don't want to deal with this  You know  Just tell me what's going on  Tell me  You know  Tell me the story 
[03:37:00]  Let me answer your question  And let's move on  Alright  Thank you Peter  Alright guys  You got it  Alright  Sink up  We're going to sync up  On that  Issue  To have a meeting  Especially  Not necessarily  Between two people  Evidently borrowed from the  Palm Pilot lexicon  Sync up  They can't just say  Hey let's have a meeting  No  Let's sync up about  The blue sky  In that issue  That we spoke about  And while you're at it  We need a couple new buckets 
[03:37:30]  Yeah  And by the way  We should also  Tee up ourselves  Assholes  Proactive  Own  You know what  Own means?  To take responsibility  For something  Someone who owns something  Can never claim  That they are out of the loop  Yeah  I own that  Great  Results driven  Scope creep  What is a scope creep?  I don't know  You tell me  The gradual inflation  Of the goals 
[03:38:00]  Of a project  As its leaders  Imagine more things  For it to do  So the scope of it  Is creeping upward  So it's an idea  That kind of gets bigger  And has more things  Put on it  I figured it was  A guy with binoculars  Whacking his bag  In some chick's bushes  Is that scope creep  Again out my window?  It's such a sad existence  I'm sorry  I'm sorry guys  I know you work hard 
[03:38:30]  You go up into the office  Every day  With your suit  And everything  What's with these words?  What a  I'm so glad  I'm in radio  In this capacity  I've said it before  I've worked for  Three homes of rock and roll  In my fine radio career  The Rochester home  Of rock and roll  Buffalo  Buffalo's home  Of rock and roll  And Long Island's  Home of rock and roll  And New York's  No  AW was just  It was the rock  Of New York 
[03:39:00]  Ah  Well when we got there  Where rock lives  Oh really?  It's not living on  All the other rock stations  Across America  What the fuck does that mean  Where rock lives?  Where rock is on life  What about when we were  That's what it was  That's what it should have been  Yeah all the jocks  Were over 60  When we got to town  And then AF  In Boston  Yeah  The only station  That really rocks  That really rocks  Oh really?  The other ones  Just rock  So when the other stations  Are playing Metallica  They're not really rocking  What the freak 
[03:39:30]  Does that mean?  The only station  That really rocks  The rock  Anyway  The reason I cranked  The monitor  I was just starting out  In radio  I was doing radio  In Buffalo  I was the overnight  Scumbag  But during the weekends  I had a real  You know  Time slot  Like I would do  Afternoon drive  Let's say 2p to 6p  Which was pretty cool  Yeah  Because then now  You know people  Are listening to you  Well I almost got fired  If the lead has this song  I'll be amazed 
[03:40:00]  You ever hear the song  By the Rolling Stones  Star F  What?  Yeah  Star Star  Star Star  Okay  Star Star  Alright  We did this promotion  And you guys  I guarantee  Will laugh at me  This isn't even a setup  Yeah  They came up with  When I was working  In Buffalo Radio  At this station  They came up  With this bright idea  The Rolling Stones  Were I don't know  Either coming to town  Alright don't play it yet  No trust me  Don't play it yet  Don't play it 
[03:40:30]  Don't play it  He played the song  He's like  Dropped all the cards  In there too  He played the song  He played the song  We're going to make him  Read out of Rent Boy  Now for doing that  Absolutely  That is Eric's punishment  Maybe that's what  We should do  That is Eric's punishment  Is that the way to do it?  Can I  Can I  Can I  Not yet 
[03:41:00]  I want to section off  What he has to read  Oh yeah okay  Yeah Eric we got a punishment  For you for jumping the gun  You overachiever  Yeah  Over eager little beaver  Alright so  The radio station  Came up with this bright idea  You know how they're always  Going with these theme weekends  We talked about  The walk party weekend  The four play weekend  Aerosmith A to Z  Gotta make a theme  So it's more  Fun for the list  The firecracker 500  500  Oh what will be number one  This year  Is it going to be  Stairway to Heaven 
[03:41:30]  Or will it be  Won't Get Fooled Again  By the Who  Oh  So they come up  With this idea  I think because  The Stones had another album  Coming out or something  Basically called  Pick Your Stones Weekend  Pick Your Stones Weekend  Pick Your Stones Weekend  They had all the laser  You're listening to  Pick Your Stones Weekend  On the home of  Rock and Roll  Pick Your Stones Weekend  Pick Your Stones Weekend  Pick Your Stones Weekend 
[03:42:00]  All weekend long  Oh yeah that's when  Production  You know then you  Couldn't be cool  Doing production  It had to be like  You didn't really care  The dry delivery  Right  Pick Your Stones Weekend  All this week  K-Rock  K-Rock  K-Rock  God radio stinks  On the only station  That really rocks  W-A-A-F  That was every  Piece of production  For A-F  But back then  It was still the laser  Oh yeah 
[03:42:30]  This is the biggest thing ever  To hit radio  Star Wars sound effects  Pick Your Stones Weekend  So basically  The concept was  You call in  And you pick a stone song  And me as the stupid DJ  I push the button  And you get to hear  Your stone song  As you're driving around  Miserable Buffalo  How about that  Quite easy right  Well they have a huge  Convention center in Buffalo  And the home of  Rock and roll was there  And they had the speakers  On the van  It was like a car show  Or something  Thousands of people there  Not exaggerating 
[03:43:00]  It was just the thing  To do in Buffalo  There's not many things  To do  So everyone went  To the convention center  And yeah  Actually it was called  The Fox I guess  The Fox was cranking out  The radio station  And I was on the air  So this girl calls up  And totally fucked me man  And I almost got fired  I had to beg for my job  Literally I think  I even had  I hate to admit it  A little tear in my eye  I have no place else  To go  I have no place else  To go  I did have to beg  For my job  So this girl goes 
[03:43:30]  Little Opie Schroeder  Oh champ  I go to the phones  And you know  Hi the Fox  Is this  Pick your stones weekend  Yes it is  What do you want to hear  Can I hear star star  By the stones  Of course  What's your favorite  Radio station  The Fox  That's right  And I start the song  So back in those days  Right  I would turn down  The monitor  And go  So anyway  And I would  Have phone sex  And talk to hot chicks 
[03:44:00]  And bitches on the phone  So I have no idea  What's playing  At the convention center  In front of a couple  Thousand people  Right  And all of a sudden  The hotline is  Eh eh eh eh  And I'm like  Really flirting  With this Buffalo Betty  Big time  And I have no idea  What's going on  With this song  So we've got to  Crank it up  Right about here  I think  Let's picture this  Picture this  Commercial radio  Being played  To thousands of people  Right  I think it takes  Another like  Thirty seconds  Right  Basically 
[03:44:30]  Would have been  An FCC violation  Oh my god  Yeah  It's coming up  Any second  It's still a cool song  But  Alright  Listen  It's okay  This is the problem  With doing radio  On the fly  We can prepare this bit  But  But just remember  No monitor  I have no idea  I'm just watching  The song countdown  Oh boy 
[03:45:00]  Yeah  Starpuck  Starpuck  Dude this is the rest  Of the song  This is pretty much  The rest of the song  They say  Someone could  Maybe we get an intern  To find out  How many times  They say fuck  The whole thing played  And now I'm like  Wow  So what do you look like  Really  Well I get off at  You know 6pm  You want to like  Meet on the corner  I'll do the drive by  To see if you're not  A fat pig  And uh  Oh yeah  I would make believe it  I would tell them  I'm driving a pickup truck  And I had a Honda  No I'll drive by  In my pickup truck 
[03:45:30]  And you know  If they were hot  You stop  If not  You're in a different car  You just keep going  Yeah  So uh  What a creep  So this is playing  At the convention center  It just says fuck  Throughout the whole song  I'm just  I'm the plebe  Of the station  There's no  Here turn that up again  That girl totally  Fucked you over  So the hotline is ringing  And it's counting down  The song's over  And then uh  Mike Benson  Really good guy  He's still up in the area  Doing radio  He's like  Dude  Did you 
[03:46:00]  Do you know what you just played?  Oh no  And then he told me  And I swear to god  I went white  I went white  And I saw my career  Which was just beginning  Just budding  Just budding  Like little  Little  Little  Thirteen year old  African  Girls  Boobies  Yeah  And uh  And her kids  And I'm like  And then the next call  The hotline's ringing  It was him first  And I swear to god  I went white  I'm like  There's no reason  Why they would keep me  I have no  I have nothing  I'm just starting out 
[03:46:30]  And then sure enough  The next call  Was the hotline  I want to see you  In my office  Monday morning  At 9am  This is really me  Begging  I got nowhere else to go  I got nowhere else to go  I got nothing else  What is your problem  You insensitive asshole  Yes 
[03:47:00]  But you know what  I think the only reason  They kept me  I was working like  70 hours a week  And making like  12 grand  So  It's cost effective  I think that's the only reason  They didn't fire me  Because they were getting  A lot out of me  You know  But can you imagine  This playing  How many times  Do they say  That's what I'm saying  We'll have it in about  10 seconds  Hang on  It's unbelievable  It's the whole song  It's the whole song  Anthony  Probably the most fucks  In any song  It's not like  The who  You know  Who the fuck are you  It goes by real fast  And that's it  Yeah well  Who the fuck are you  Just imagine  This playing at a convention center  For thousands of people 
[03:47:30]  And Mike Benson  He's like  I couldn't get the speaker  Not only did he  Well I guess they couldn't  Turn the volume off  In the van  Because it was  Whatever  So he's grabbing  This huge speakers  Off the van  Jumping on top  Of the woofer  To try to muffle  The sound  Try to find  Where the volume was  Yeah cause people  Probably knew  What it was  Before the song  Even started  When she requested it  Right  And you went  Yeah  People probably  Already started panicking  Like uh oh  I know what that song is  I was playing DJ  Like I made believe 
[03:48:00]  I knew the song  That's why they wanted  To fire us  I said like  You sound like  I'm like  I never heard the song  In my life  I just thought  It was a stone  You know  We're playing any stone song  And I just turned down  The monitor  Just turn it down  And I'm back on the phone  Flirt with this girl  And this is what's going on  All over the areas  She tried to screw you  She knew what the song was  Alright how many fucks  Are in that song  This lyric page here  Is saying 35 times  Nah it's way more  Gotta be more than that  Gotta be more than that  They probably just  Do it once for the chorus  And they count it as one  Yeah listen  Get an intern  In the other room  To just  It's quick 
[03:48:30]  I guarantee  It's more than 35  It's gotta be  That's a lot  35 is a lot  Dude that's the whole song  Just over and over  Going fuck the star  Fuck the star  Why didn't they fire  Did they realize  That Spuds Buckley  Was irreplaceable  When you're making  12,000 a year  Yes  Irreplaceable  12 large  Nice  I was doing  Midnight to 6  And then I would sit in  On the Bear Man show  All the way to 10 a.m.  Anthony  The what?  The Bear Man  He's a good guy  The Bear Man  He was the guy I told you  I used to 
[03:49:00]  Tape my sexcapades  Yeah but  The Bear Man  And then play it back for him  Yeah  What was the name?  His name was The Bear Man  Ugh  Why?  He's like the king of  Allentown radio  To this day  Bear like  Arr  A bear like  You're ready to jump  In a crock pit  Huge guy  In New York  Huge  Six  Yeah  Six maybe  300  Oh okay  That's what I was  I was asking  Why the Bear Man  And he's big like a bear  And I don't know  What he's doing now  But back then  He did some great radio  He's the king of what? 
[03:49:30]  Well he went  He's from like  Allentown area so  The king of Allentown radio?  Yeah  They brought him into Buffalo  And then he moved back home  He does fine for himself  I'm not saying he doesn't  But just that title is awful  Well that's the title  I just gave him  I don't know what they call him  For seven cents a day  You can get Opie and Anthony  Or feed this little kid  With the flies on his face  But you want to laugh  Don't you?  You don't want to be depressed  Watching starving children  So turn him off  And turn on Opie and Anthony  And we'll send you a photo  Of the child you're helping  In the outfit of your choice 
[03:50:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show  So it's great to be back in Texas  Where the speed limit on the interstate  Is 70 miles an hour  Unless you're in an 18-wheeler  Then it's 65 miles an hour  Unless it's at night  Then it's 60 miles an hour  Unless you're in a car  Pulling a big trailer  Then it's 55 miles an hour  And they do this of course 
[03:50:30]  Because having everybody  Drive the same speed  On the same road  Just doesn't make sense  I'm surprised they make them  Drive the same direction  How about you? 
[03:51:00]  I couldn't spell  When I was a little kid  I couldn't spell  So my parents got all concerned  So they went down to the toy store  They bought me a little red box  Called Speak and Spell  You remember that?  Speak and Spell?  They shouldn't have called it  Speak and Spell  But they should have called it  Speak like the devil  Remember the voice?  A-E-I-O  What was that?  A-B-T-E  That thing was evil  A-L-A-M-N  That thing would wake me 
[03:51:30]  In the middle of the night  Like 2 in the morning  Play with me  Get up  I want to spell  Right now  I'm 8 years old  I spell great  I talk like a freak  I'm like  Mom something is wrong  Something is W-R-N-G  Have you ever been listening

[03:55:30]  No he's bowing  He's okay  There he goes  He got his back  He's got my back  Keith you got his back  I don't have his back  I was just handing him that  In case he might need it  How was he able to bring that in  Was that a 9mm  What is going on  Ixnay  Wow cool  Wow sensei  No that's good music  It's not faggy  Thank you  It shows you know  The training that is involved  Wait why was he allowed to bring that in today  There's nothing here 
[03:56:00]  I know he's a friend of ours but  It's like show and tell  There's nothing here even  I don't know what you're talking about  Oh my god  That just made me go  I don't even know what you're talking about  I don't like the theme music  You picked for Master Poe  Why don't you like that  I don't think it's suiting  I think it's too soft  Did you ever see the Karate Kid  Boy did I  There's some ass kicking going on  That hot scene where he's laying on the table  And Miyagi rubs his hands together  I will fix your arm  And your leg Tanya-san  Happy ending 
[03:56:30]  There's a little happy ending on the table  In the back room  And then he could come out  And even though mean sensei  Was telling the kid  You know  To beat up  Young  What's his  Daniel-san  Daniel-san  Daniel-san rose above it all  Whack on  Whack off  Right  Show me  Happy ending  Show me  Whack on  Show me  Whack off  So this guy  That killed his first wife  Down  Up down  Faster Daniel-san  Make Miyagi explode 
[03:57:00]  So  That guy  Yes  He was very pissed off  About that guy  That killed his first wife  Wow  Why  Well first of all  I don't think that  Any man should hurt a woman  Oh  I don't think that  A man should raise their hands  To a woman  Unless the woman is trying to kill him  Then you would have to  Or unless the woman takes half of everything you've  Yeah that's monetary  You could always gain that once again  How about if she's talking during the game? 
[03:57:30]  You know  It seems silly with our promos that we play  But you would not get an argument out of anybody in this room  Of course  We are probably the biggest pussies when it comes to women  They would be  They could crap all over us  Yes they can  And you still wouldn't  I didn't mean it literally  Except in Jim's  They have  I've never done anything like that  Never even raised a hand  No  I don't believe in that  Defensive  You know  Put your arms up and go  Stop  Have you done that? 
[03:58:00]  Sensei  No you don't  You don't pick your hands up at all  Nothing just let them hit you  Well you can take it  No the best thing that you can do is just take your hands  Cut them  Place them in front of you  Oh in front of your balls  And walk away  No  Because as soon as you raise your hands  It looks like you're aggressively going at them  And then they'll say  And then someone  Ten feet away will say  I saw them with the raised hands  Exactly  Instead of  I was protecting my nutsack  And that was it  Hands in front of me 
[03:58:30]  Words to live by Lloyd  Words to live by  Words to live by  Alright thanks Master Poe  Thank you Master Poe  And there he goes  There he goes  Nothing's ever gone  There you go  There he goes  He bows when he leaves  Kneel in front of Sensei  Kneel in front of Sensei  Take a knee  Remember the mean Sensei in Karate Kid?  Sure do  He looked at that gook Mr. Miyagi  And wanted to just  You know  Because he was in the knob  Sure  Wanted to slit his throat  I wanted to discuss briefly 
[03:59:00]  Remember in part 3  Was it part 3  When the mean Sensei  Pretended to be a nice Sensei  Yes  The mean Sensei  Pretended to be nice Sensei  And he was helping La Russa  And he was making him punch  The wood  Boy that was really intense  Wasn't it?  Yeah  You really saw the third version  Who didn't?  Who didn't see them all?  You didn't see every Karate Kid?  Part 2 was actually good  Was it?  Yeah it was good  Where he goes to karate chop the guy's neck  And he goes  And he grabs his nose  I did enjoy that  That Pat Morita 
[03:59:30]  It rubs the lotion on its skin  It does this when it's told  It rubs the lotion on its skin  Or else it gets the hose  And when it's done  There's one more thing  A simple little task  It's put the fucking lotion in the basket  Put the fucking lotion in the basket  All these stupid women are the same  Helps me not to think of them as human 
[04:00:00]  So I call them it  Instead of by their names  Mister please no more abuse  Can't you see there's no excuse  My family's probably wondering where I've been  Most of you  So your skin gets loose  Stop crying out your big fat moose  Just put the fucking lotion on your skin  And then put the fucking lotion in the basket  Your chances for survival are remote 
[04:00:30]  I'm impervious to all your silly whining  So I'm down before I jam them off  I'm down your fucking throat  Mister please my mom's got money  Let me go this isn't funny  Cops are sure to send somebody  Turn me loose don't be a dummy  Listen to your scream and wail  Keep it down you fucking wail  Mind the broken fingernail  The last girl climbed halfway but failed 
[04:01:00]  Precious  She's down here you piece of shit  Put the fucking poodle in the basket  I'd kill you but there's someone at the door  Don't make me go and get my gun and shoot you 
[04:01:30]  It's a waste of skin they don't sell fat girls in a fucking store  Put my fucking precious in the basket  Don't you hurt my one and only friend  You don't know what pain is but I'll teach you  If you lay a fucking finger on my poodle's pretty head  Put the fucking poodle in the basket  That's it for the worst of Opie and Anthony
