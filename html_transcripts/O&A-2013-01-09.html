<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts engaging in vulgar, sexually explicit banter and profanity-laced jokes about genitalia.  Their lack of a prep sheet, due to perceived failures of their staff (E-Rock, Iraq, Sal, Travis, Troy, and executive producer "Gary, the radio wizard"), became a major theme.  Opie vehemently criticized their lack of preparedness, using offensive language to express his frustration.  The absence of a prep sheet forced them to improvise, leading to a discussion of outdated news stories, including those about Jimmy Snuka, Alex Jones's appearance on Piers Morgan, the Sandy Hook shooting, and a deli gang rape.  They also discussed Gary's alleged removal of their humorous studio signs.

Alex Jones, a scheduled guest, called in.  His pre-recorded audio segment, and a later live call, focused on his recent experiences in New York City, where he claimed to be followed and surveilled by police due to his views on gun control. He described the alleged harassment in a hyperbolic style, recounting anecdotes involving Alan Dershowitz and Piers Morgan, and alleging a government conspiracy. The hosts and callers debated the validity of Jones's claims, acknowledging his entertaining delivery.

The show then veered into discussions about Brent Musburger's controversial comments on a female college football player's attractiveness, the Carmelo Anthony/Kevin Garnett altercation (involving a cereal-related insult), and the excessive disclaimers in pharmaceutical commercials. They also anticipated the arrival of Jimmy Snuka.  The hosts also engaged in a humorous, yet crude, discussion about a personal habit of leg shaking in bed and criticized their show’s “Line of the Day” segment.  They found a video of a cameraman tackling a woman in a jersey during a staged football segment hilarious, repeatedly requesting it be shown and shared online. They then further discussed the Mirapex commercial, focusing on its side effects and commenting on the over-reliance on prescription medication.


Alex Jones called in again live, discussing his NYC experiences, appearances on Piers Morgan’s show, threats he received concerning gun control, gun statistics, “assault weapons,” media bias, proposed gun control legislation, potential government overreach, threats against him and his family, and Jesse Ventura's lawsuit against Chris Kyle. He expressed belief in a brewing conflict between gun owners and the government before handing off to another pre-arranged interview.

Professional wrestler Jimmy "Superfly" Snuka then joined the show.  The interview covered his wrestling career, relationships with other wrestlers (Bob Backlund, Hulk Hogan), his daughter Tamina's career, humorous anecdotes about her training, his film appearances, his book ("Superfly: The Jimmy Snuka Story"), and a tragic accident involving a young woman detailed in his book. The discussion included his past drug use, current health, family life, and his signature wrestling move and cliff diving.  The interview was punctuated by vulgar language and sexually suggestive comments from both Snuka and the hosts.

The show transitioned into the Jim Norton segment.  Norton fielded listener calls covering a range of topics, including a mysterious lump, sex addiction, Twitter addiction, a movie theater confrontation, a relationship with a cousin’s girlfriend, and other relationship issues.  He gave crass and cynical advice, often using vulgar and sexually explicit language.  A notable call came from Louis C.K., discussing his career, high school experiences, and the business of comedy.  More calls about relationship issues and a humorous call about a panic attack concluded the segment.

The final segment consisted of listener calls. Mike from Vegas sought advice on introducing a threesome to his girlfriend, while Pat from New Jersey, a former intern, lamented his current job as a janitor and sought career advice. The hosts offered suggestions, including using Craigslist ads and connecting with Bob Kelly for podcasting advice. Comedian Joe DeRosa made a brief, impromptu appearance.  The show concluded with a sexually suggestive commercial for Steven Singer Jewelers and a mention of Louis C.K.'s earlier call.  Throughout the entire broadcast, the hosts and guests frequently used profanity and offensive language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Satsang with Mooji 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  It's going to melt your mind.  So vulgar.  Shut up, you fucking degenerate hippie cocksucker.  I would take a shot in the face for a minute.  Very small cock.  So flatulent.  I've farted three times since I've been here.  I'm like, all right, you'll be an Anthony show.  Here we are.  Another four hours of love.  The jokes all end up talking about cock and ball. 
[00:04:00]  This is good practice when I do the view.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  This probably is the greatest net ever existed.  You guys having a good time or what?  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah!  Yeah!  Rules are destroyed and conventions burn to the ground.  Don't do it.  I can't take it every time I'm on the show.  He's cock.  With Opie, the destroyer.  You're a bigger douchebag. 
[00:04:30]  You're a big douchebag.  That's what I do now.  Anthony.  The rage.  Yeah, yeah, your guy had a corner on the peanut.  We understand.  I'll give it to your guy and the peanut.  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender.  That's why I can't even take fingers in my ass because it makes me feel like I have to shit.  All kidding aside, dicks have to feel wonderful, but I just can't take them.  Opie Anthony show.  Strap in.  Strap the fuck in.  This one's gonna hurt.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:05:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  Oh, boy.  Good morning, everyone.  Oh, boy.  Hi, everybody.  Always a problem.  Always a problem.  Hi, people.  I'm amazed we're able to keep this radio show going.  Wow.  I'm amazed.  Kazowie.  I'm absolutely amazed.  So it's, I don't know what.  What is it?  6.15.  Ooh.  And we don't have what's called a prep sheet in front of us.  Well, there's a reason for that, though. 
[00:05:30]  What's the reason?  All the printers were jammed.  According to E-Rock, all the printers were jammed.  But we had to tell E-Rock we don't have a prep sheet.  And then he realized we didn't have a prep sheet.  And then he realized I better come up with an excuse.  Or is it a real excuse?  Like, what's going on?  Like, I don't.  A real excuse.  I don't need anyone to prepare the radio show for myself.  But if we set up something and it's not being done, then someone has to tell me and I'll prepare for the radio show. 
[00:06:00]  There doesn't seem to be any slack picker-uppers here.  Like, when there's some slack, it just stays slack.  How a radio show goes, we're always preparing in our stupid heads, right?  And then we come in here in the morning and there's a one sheet of basic shit, you know, off the top of my head, Brent Musburger, quote, being creepy.  I don't think he was, but we're going to talk about that.  Of course, Alex Jones would be on there.  Then he got silly birthdays that maybe you could play off.  Or, like, the top Twitter trends, you could maybe play off that, this day in history, that type of shit.  And then some of the other headlines. 
[00:06:30]  And it might be one that you forgot about yourself.  Like, oh, thank God it's on the prep sheet because I forgot about that one.  Yeah, yeah.  So we start the radio show with nothing in front of us.  There's no one sheet, none of those lists of things that we might go to.  Iraq had no idea we didn't have a prep sheet in front of us.  And then I said to Sam, what's going on with the prep sheet?  Sam goes to Iraq, what's going on with the prep sheet?  That's when Iraq had some kind of crazy realization and then decided to tell Sam that all the printers are jammed.  Every printer is jammed. 
[00:07:00]  And that he needs to go back to the office.  But my point is he wasn't going to do any of that unless we brought it up.  I think Sal has something for the program.  Sal, I was able to print out my stuff.  So why wouldn't you print out everything else?  We didn't have it.  Or why wouldn't you, like, check up on Iraq and others?  We're down a few staff members right now.  I'm not even going to blame Sal for this one.  Why not?  Because it should be Iraq should have been the next guy on the fucking little list that would have gotten together the show, printed it out, and laid it out. 
[00:07:30]  Sal might not even know what he needs to do.  He knows what we get.  Iraq knows what we get every morning.  But Sal, this is how you move up in the business.  Well, Sal, you could have...  You should be kind of making, you know, taking a little look around every morning.  That would have been an extra thing.  Like, that would have been like, wow, Sal stepped up.  Right in our heads, we'd go, boom, whoa, hey, this Sal.  But this should have been Iraq's job.  Which, by the way, not one boom yet in my head.  Oh, Jesus.  Not a one.  He's all, I got my stuff. 
[00:08:00]  Well, that's good.  Good for you.  I got mines.  Good for you.  Yo.  Like, I don't even know who the guests are today.  You had to tell me it's Jimmy Snuka, which that would be great.  Okay.  Super fun.  And I know Alex Jones is calling in because Roland texted me personally about that.  Nice.  The problem with, like, situations like this is it makes you guys kind of just give up on the fact that there's a staff.  You just said, we'll just prep ourselves.  I can prep myself.  Just tell us.  Yeah, but that makes the staff.  I have no problem doing that.  Completely obsolete. 
[00:08:30]  You are obsolete.  Just tell me that's what we need to do.  I'll start tomorrow.  It's fine.  Oh.  But we've set up a system that has worked for many, many years where, you know, you guys throw stuff on the sheet.  And there are stuff in there that, you know, I didn't think of or anyone else in the room thinks of.  That's why it sort of works.  You know what you're doing, don't you?  What?  Oh, boy.  Radio Wiz is going to have a field day with this one.  And it gives him the opportunity to go, I could do something.  My job.  I'm going to rail the shit out of the staff for not stepping up. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, dude, he's going to rip them the fucking part.  Well, they laugh.  But they laugh.  Oh, I know.  Not E-Rock.  E-Rock's going to get killed, and he doesn't laugh.  He's scared.  Oh, shit.  But the rest of you are like, oh, this is hilarious.  Uh-oh.  Call up Laszlo.  See if there's a job over at Rockstar there, E-Rock.  The fucking graveyard of all of our staff.  Oh, boy.  That's...  Oh, trouble.  I would imagine the other big radio shows here at SiriusXM aren't searching around for 
[00:09:30]  a prep sheet after the show starts.  What do they need?  What song are they playing at 9?  I'm talking about, like, Howard Stern's show, and there's a few others.  There's a few others.  Is he here?  Probably.  I don't know.  Is he here today?  What day is he?  No idea.  Could have gotten in, like, 10 minutes early.  Oh, shit.  Let's see if the printers are...  Wait, what time did he get here?  Uh-oh.  Well, if you find out the printers are jammed, and you get here at 530...  But see, and this is where I'm in a tough spot, because then you sound like, you know, 
[00:10:00]  but I have to say it.  Oh, no.  Because I don't want to blow up anyone's spot, but Travis is out with the flu really bad.  Yes.  We're down a couple staff members as is.  Is Troy sick?  He was sick too.  Troy still has the flu.  Troy has nothing to do with this.  He's just a production guy.  Right.  So why wouldn't E-Rock and the rest of you guys come in here a little earlier?  And there I am blowing up people's spots, which sucks.  But then when shit like this goes down, you gotta.  And why is it the radio wizard here? 
[00:10:30]  He knows we're down staff members, and he knows someone has the flu.  Wouldn't it be his job to step up in that spot?  He's been fucking bald.  Oh, sorry.  But what is his job here?  What is it?  I'm going to say it every day.  What is it?  If you know the show you're looking after is down staff members, and then the executive  producer is out with the flu really bad.  He's out for the third day in a row.  Why wouldn't you take it upon yourself and go, look, you know, might be a little below  me, but I gotta make sure this fucking channel runs properly. 
[00:11:00]  I gotta get in here early.  Why wouldn't he get in here early for a few days?  Oh, gosh.  Is that printer still broken?  I couldn't find another printer from...  Is this him?  I-Rod, how you doing?  You forgot about the prep sheet?  Be honest.  No, I didn't forget about it.  Uh-oh.  Well, then why did we have to ask you about the prep sheet when we went live?  I-Rod, comment.  Yeah.  I knew you didn't have it.  I was still waiting to try to get it to print.  What were you waiting for?  I'm just curious.  I don't disagree.  The one down there doesn't work, and as I was going through stories and printing stuff 
[00:11:30]  out, that wasn't printing, but I didn't know that until I went out there, and  it was jammed, and then all the Spanish stuff started printing.  No, but why wouldn't it be in front of us?  Oh, it's the Spanish.  But why wouldn't it just be in front of us?  All that stuff, I understand, could go wrong, but why wouldn't you figure out all that stuff  before we broadcast?  This was after six.  I came in, and it wasn't here.  I know.  Oh, boy.  And we squeezed, you know, we got on a little late today.  What time did you get here?  I probably came in at ten after six, as I always do.  Oh, my God.  That's impossible.  The sheet wasn't here. 
[00:12:00]  It wasn't?  No.  I didn't get emails last night, either.  Did you email out stories or no?  Oh, Jimmy Superfly Snook is in today, Opie.  Bonner got elected speaker again?  Whoa.  Is that really on the prep sheet?  I don't know.  That's one of the news stories.  Yeah.  House, reelects, banner, speaker.  But didn't that happen already?  Yeah.  What happened?  This was the prep sheets that I got.  Uh-oh.  From Travis.  Bonner was reelected about three, four days ago.  This is everything that was in the email that he sent me. 
[00:12:30]  Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez split about six months ago.  That's an older story, too.  Barack Obama reelected to second term.  Oh.  Shooting massacre in Sandy Hook.  Wow.  That's going to be a big one.  When did Meredith Vieira say shit on TV?  That was Thursday.  Oh, my God.  That was last week.  That was definitely last week's story.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Connecticut newspaper outrages readers by placing gun show ad on the same page as Sandy Hook.  Massacre.  I remember that. 
[00:13:00]  I didn't hear that.  That was Thursday.  Wait, Meredith Vieira.  Yeah, that's definitely from last week.  That was last Thursday.  Placing gun show ad.  That's...  Wade Boggs.  This is an old story.  Wade Boggs bought the Field of Dreams baseball film.  That's a story from last week.  I remember that.  Whatever.  Oh, boy.  It just doesn't fucking matter who gives a fuck.  Oh, this is cool.  We didn't talk about this.  It matters to me as being a good father who gives a fuck.  The Deli Gang Rape.  Youngest attacker ripped out victims' intestines with bare hands.  Oh, my God. 
[00:13:30]  I don't remember hearing that.  This story...  I got this story four or five days ago already.  Oh.  These are stories I've already gotten last week.  Oh, boy.  Hold on now.  Let's get some more.  FBI.  More people killed with hammers and clubs each year.  No way.  You know what?  I'm future boy.  This actually didn't happen yet.  I predict Alex Jones will be on Piers Morgan.  Oh.  That's not in there.  No, no, no.  FBI.  More people kill with hammers and clubs each year.  And I think that's what Alex Jones was saying.  Ah.  But that's a new... 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  It's...  Oh, cool.  All right.  Cool.  You know what?  I stand corrected.  Oh, what happened?  I apologize.  Liberty Media to take control of Sirius XM Radio.  I think Opie is future boy then.  That happened already.  No, but that's one of the news stories.  That happened already.  Oh.  They have to wait 60 days.  We're down to 53 or 54.  That happened like a week ago.  You just said within 60 days.  Oh, yeah.  It says here.  We're down to 53, I think.  Oh, no.  54.  Oh, it's from five days ago. 
[00:14:30]  Oh.  It's from five days ago.  Oh, you have the actual old emails?  No, I just Google newsed it.  Comment.  Comment, T-Roc.  Comment.  From five days ago.  Yeah.  Those are old news stories.  Oh, okay.  Why wouldn't you check your work?  Oh, no.  Printer was broke, I guess.  No.  I should have checked it.  I just printed out the files that were sent to me.  I'm just going to put these here for later. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, right in the shit can.  Right in the can.  That's great.  You got this new company taking over, and we don't know what the fuck they're thinking,  and we're taking chances like this.  That's not really smart.  You got Laszlo's number there, Iraq?  Yeah.  What's the update?  Laszlo's number over there.  No, I blame his name's Gary.  We call him the radio wizard.  He stinks, and he's a piece of shit.  Uh-oh.  And he doesn't know what the fuck he's doing.  And he was given to us years ago, and he was supposed to take care of everything and 
[00:15:30]  get things done.  The guy can't even do the basics.  Let me tell you something.  My brother runs a restaurant, F.H. Riley's, right?  He doesn't want to cook anymore because he's the owner of the fucking place.  So he gets the recipes is what all fucking restaurant owners do.  And then you hire a fucking cook that, you know, can create your shit.  Guess what?  When the fucking cook gets fired or quits, the fucking owner of the restaurant, my brother,  Brad Hughes, has to go and cook for a while until it's all figured out. 
[00:16:00]  Mm-hmm.  And that's what this idiot should be doing.  Oh, since he was a young boy, he's been fucking bald.  But we're down staff members, and we got the main guy with the fucking flu, and this  idiot doesn't think that that's important enough for him to get his ass in here and  be the chef for a little while.  Oh, Jesus.  That's how this shit works.  And the reason we bring it up, because I know people bitch, that we bitch too much,  is because they deal with the same shit with their dumb middle management bosses.  Uh-huh. 
[00:16:30]  Sometimes you've got to step into a role you don't really want to do.  Yeah, you think you might be past being the chef, but you're not, Gary.  Oh, boy.  He's got to get that apron on and get the fuck in here.  Right, until it's all figured out again, and then you move to your position where you  come in lazily around, what, 8, 8.30.  Start rattling those pots and pans, for the love of God.  Right?  Right.  I completely blame him.  He knows that Travis is out with the flu.  Travis has been writing us and keeping us informed every day, saying, I'm out another day. 
[00:17:00]  So then why wouldn't you be the guy that comes in to make sure everything is working properly?  Be the man.  Well, now we've got a prep sheet with stories that's a week old.  With a new company taking over.  We don't even know what the fuck these guys are thinking.  Okay.  I'm coming in later.  Open Anthony.  Under radio dial.  Maybe he was hoping somebody would rise to the occasion in his absence. 
[00:17:30]  Oh.  And then he doesn't even understand the whole studio bit we're doing.  I heard he angrily ripped down our signs yesterday.  Angrily?  Angrily.  Really?  When we've turned it into a fun, stupid radio bit.  It's a little joke.  And I will say it's stupid.  It's a dumb little bit we're doing.  Martha Stewart's channel is no longer.  Her studio is empty.  So we're all kind of vying for that spot.  Yeah.  So we put up signs yesterday saying, the future home of Open Anthony.  Who would take that seriously? 
[00:18:00]  Of course.  They're cartoon signs with Jimmy giving the finger or something.  What, did somebody rip one of them off and go to management?  One of those twats probably complained.  Right as you were ending, we were transitioning to the after show.  Somebody went over there, took one of the signs, and walked off.  Oh.  And then about ten minutes later, Gary came stomping down the hallway and took all of them down while Sam was doing the after show.  Did you bring it up on the after show?  No, because I didn't see it happening.  Oh.  Make sure you bring up all that stuff, because trust me, he ain't getting you a raise. 
[00:18:30]  He can't do shit for you.  Oh, Jesus.  And when you realize that, then you're going to be a better broadcaster.  He stinks.  Oh, boy.  This is real.  This isn't fucking, let's have fun and do a little radio.  Guy's useless.  Don't listen to him.  None of you guys should listen to him.  He can't do shit for you.  He's been teasing a raise for you for years.  He stinks.  Fucking dangling.  You go right to Scott Greenstein in the fucking corner office.  Dangling.  He's the only guy that can get things done.  Right in front of your face.  It's dangling.  Woo-doo. 
[00:19:00]  Toot-dee-doo.  And then pulls it away.  There's nothing.  Oh, boy.  Look at that.  You grab for it.  What do you got in your hand?  Nothing.  More air.  Nothing.  The guy should be in here.  We have no staff.  Oh, Jesus.  With the main guy behind the scenes with the flu.  So then you go, oh, fuck.  I got to set my alarm clock.  It's going to suck for a few days, but it's important.  It's important to the channel.  It's important to the guys.  It's important to the company.  But no, he'll come strolling in here in another hour or so. 
[00:19:30]  Can we just grab mashups, show prep?  I'm sure that's up to date.  Oh, he is.  Just entertainment news.  That's topical.  Right.  Foot reports.  Toenails.  Corns.  Athlete's foot.  Super fine.  Yes.  Get feet shaven.  Have bunions.  Go to fucking China.  Get feet wrapped.  You know, because they do that with the women there.  Oh.  Wrap them up so they get little feet.  That's cute.  Oh, she would be executed in China for dumb big feet. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  They'd expect her to be breathing fire on the townspeople.  Giant monster feet.  It's the monster foot, bitch.  Oh, boy.  As Opie disgustingly throws the prep.  Which else is on the sheet?  We've been at this a long fucking time, man.  And that idiot is just simply in our way.  Because, like, you know, unfortunately we don't have the best relationship with Tim Sabian.  Because, you know, he's...  If you work for Howard, you know, then you've got to kind of hate us.  Or make believe you like us. 
[00:20:30]  Anyway.  But he knows how to run a fucking channel.  Yes.  The guy knows how to run a fucking channel.  Tim Sabian would absolutely fucking be here if he knew the staff was shorthanded and, you know, guys were out with the flu.  And he would be popping his head and going, what the fuck can I do?  And I would go, well, I know we don't have a prep sheet yet.  Could start there.  What's that?  I don't know.  Looks like a prep sheet.  It's just a layout.  Can I see it? 
[00:21:00]  A template.  Yeah, just a template.  Oh, that's the outline they use?  Oh, cool.  We have two guys.  Yeah.  We have Sam and E-Rock.  Right.  Sal is still, I don't know.  Piece of shit?  An apprentice or whatever the fuck we call it.  Albatross?  Anchor?  No, he got his stuff today.  I got mine.  I got mine, motherfucker.  Mine printed out just dandy.  What was your stuff that you printed out?  Oh, boy.  What was it?  Pages of Blue Boy Magazine?  Don't highlight your stuff unless you're ready for it to be checked. 
[00:21:30]  What'd you print out?  Yeah, what do you need?  The one sheets.  What?  The one sheets, meaning the...  For the guests.  Oh.  Superfly Bio.  But Sal, this is an opportunity for you.  Wouldn't you kind of, you know, you know we're shorthanded, so you may be checking with,  you know, Sam and you're checking in with E-Rock and you know there's prep sheets that  should be printed out.  He couldn't possibly have known the prep sheets weren't printed out.  I mean, I was running around doing my usual routine.  And unless you think about it every day.  What's your usual routine when I get here in the morning? 
[00:22:00]  What is your usual routine?  Find hole in bathroom stall wall.  That's right.  Put mouth in front.  Wait.  Breathe through nose.  His nose fogs up the fucking, the side of the fucking stall like in Jurassic Park when  the dinosaur...  His eye, you see the pupil, big cock coming through.  Jesus.  What's your usual routine?  It's okay, Jimmy.  What time do you get here?  I get here a quarter after five. 
[00:22:30]  That's good.  When I was coming up in business, I was pretty much here at four in the morning.  Jesus.  All right.  Fair enough.  You're lazy.  That's cool.  All right.  You're lazy.  That's cool.  But I think back to when I was...  How old are you?  I'm 22.  Oh, jeez.  Still confused about his sexuality.  22.  22, I didn't even have...  I didn't even have my shot at radio yet.  No.  And then when I did, I pretty much lived at the radio station. 
[00:23:00]  I lived there.  You know how I know it.  I was there for everyone's shifts, trying to pick up whatever I can.  I did the overnight shift, and then I said, you know what?  Overnights is fucking boring.  I'm just playing music, and I get to talk here and there, get a little edgy.  So you know what I'm going to do?  I'm going to stay through the whole morning show to see what I can learn.  But he gets here at 5.15.  That's cool.  Nice.  All right.  Then what?  I set up a studio.  What do you mean set up the studio?  Because Mars sets up the studio.  Just all the other miscellaneous things that Mars doesn't do. 
[00:23:30]  Like what?  I bring water bottles, newspapers, pens, all that sort of, you know, the things that you  guys like to have there.  I get that ready.  Do you normally put the prep sheet down?  I have a good relationship with the black janitor.  He can easily do that job.  Wow.  Easily.  You should order him to.  All right.  Put that shit in our studio.  Yeah.  He likes brushing his teeth in our bathroom.  I see that.  And we have a little conversation.  He's very nice.  He's finally friendly.  They always had unfriendly janitors. 
[00:24:00]  He's actually the only nice janitor they ever had.  There was one guy I thought he was going to, you know, cut us.  The Spanish guy.  He scared the fuck out of me.  He was crazy.  I held my pee in because I didn't want to go in there.  All right.  Then what?  You got water, pens, and newspapers.  Yeah.  I take care of all that sort of stuff.  And then I can bring my own water.  I do have my own pen.  And I certainly could grab a newspaper on the way in.  All right.  But you're valuable.  What else?  Then I come in here.  I check the channel.  Make sure we're going to get the show started on time.  Get all that.  What do you mean to check the channel?  Because sometimes it's like we'll be a little bit under or late depending on how the replay ran. 
[00:24:30]  Why haven't you checked the channel?  It's right here.  Check the channel.  It's in the house.  It's broadcasting right here.  Oh, my God.  Right here.  I think he's in the room with us.  Yeah, boy.  You check the channel.  Yep.  Once that's good, I print out anything I need to print out like one sheets or anything like that.  Then I come in here, set up Pro Tools to record. 
[00:25:00]  What's the setup for Pro Tools?  You just turn it on.  You just turn it on.  No, you just got to make sure it's running.  It's kind of like turning your phone on in the morning.  Exactly.  I got to turn my phone on.  When is it not running?  Has it ever been not running?  Well, we close it out at the end of the show.  No, I mean when you turn it on.  You're basically turning on something and making it sound like it's way more important.  No, but it's just like my job.  If I wasn't here, someone would do it.  But has it ever not worked after you turned it on?  That's all I need to know.  No, it always works.  Okay, so you're just turning something on. 
[00:25:30]  I got to turn on Pro Tools.  Then I get the one sheet, two sheet, red sheet, blue sheet.  Check the channel for channels.  Channels?  Check the channels.  He's here with us and he's useless.  And then what happens, Sal?  Then you have some kind of conversation with me that you blow out of proportion.  I'm exhausted already just thinking of his day.  I'm surprised we didn't talk about Honey Nut Cheerios today. 
[00:26:00]  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  And then since I don't have any interns, I've been doing like the coffee runs and all that sort of stuff.  And I usually get Ant's Ice minus the cologne.  ice ice sal  probably should get in earlier yeah yeah i think so 22 year old kid i would oh boy  that's up to you though that's your future good luck with it oh 
[00:26:30]  the future and then he rock you know he comes in whenever the fuck he wants  we tried for years on that one i i quite frankly uh blame mostly iraq this is on this one this one  i put on and i love iraq this one is completely on iraq because he's the senior guy i can't stand  sal and i'm on salsa sal's just doing what he normally does you know kind of he's just traipsing  around looking peeking out you i absolutely i absolutely agree with you guys but what i'm  saying is there's an opportunity there for him to learn and kind of like you know here's the thing 
[00:27:00]  show some show some importance i can't see that sal would have even known wow that the one sheet  would have had to have been put here i would assume on a daily basis that the one sheet's there because  it's somebody's job to get it there so i'm not going to be checking other people's work to see  if it's done if i knew if somebody had said to me hey make sure the one sheet's out while everyone's  gone i would have been like oh right that makes sense like i can't blame i would love to blame 
[00:27:30]  but i really can't iraq on the other hand knows that our producer is out with the flu and knows  what his duties are and has to step up but and of course then the radio wizard should be you know  right right right overseeing and saying all right look what does travis do who's going to step up and  do this and this you know he's the guy that should be stepping exactly everyone that owns a business  out there there's a lot of small business owners listening to us right the fuck now i'm speaking 
[00:28:00]  their language there are times you have to fucking do a job below you in your business you because you  have to have coverage right and then you go back to being the owner or whatever the fuck  holy fuck everyone knows that it's the basic rules of business jump in jehoshaphat i i have a feeling  the guy he never wanted this gig but you know the money was nice a little bump up and pay  go back to doing music i hear you're a good music guy oh it's gonna get us a guy that knows this shit 
[00:28:30]  oh jesus yes i wish wiki was back oh wow i'll say it holy shit i don't think that's ever been said  i'll say it anybody not even wiki's wife has said that wiki i love you now text me and say oh  i know you're out there do you still work for this company yeah yeah fucking astounding yeah  what does he have like all these so much easier he's like broad-minded and stuff like that really  yeah yeah he's doing well he's in dc right he's based out of that big empty shell of a facility in 
[00:29:00]  dc there's nine employees uh big cafeteria in dc oh it was wonderful going down it was like future  world yeah i loved going down there it was cool man you could get whatever you wanted for lunch  it was awesome you never had to leave the compound it was fucking studios everywhere all you had to do  was find someone with one of those fucking lunch badges and you were in man hey what do you what  do you want let's look oh that looks tempting today it was like your high school cafeteria with  really good stuff now liberty's gonna walk around and go what's that building being used for 
[00:29:30]  oh nice lunches yep all right out of there you gotta put it in a smaller facility they might do that  imagine if they get rid of this and have everybody has to move to dc no i'm out i'm out they  wouldn't do that i'm out in a second no problem too it's not guest friendly dc isn't as guest  friendly no you need it you need to be in new york you have to be in new york what if they get  rid of the washington um facility i'm i don't know what what is right out of dc yeah what is running  out of dc where they need that there was rumors that they were gonna uh throw a lot of the music 
[00:30:00]  channels down there oh yeah there are still a lot of the music shows that run out of there oh okay  oh okay my bonyard show ran out of there for a long time until we finally switched it hey sal if they told you to  move to dc would you yeah of course all right do you think you would no i don't either no i would  love to to like move for work it'd be pretty no not ac dc as in lifestyle oh  you want to live in dc it stinks no no living in maryland might be fun like right around the beltway 
[00:30:30]  but uh in dc i wouldn't want to live in dc no fuck way no i like the suburbs the suburbs  suburb is nice i want to live by the cia so i can tell people i work there oh that would be fun  like voss would be probably down there as a profiler qualico oh i like our trips to dc i like  them a lot um so you don't think gary gets to move that wall bit oh boy probably not we  i mean i who cares who are we pissing off that he has to march down and rip our signs off 
[00:31:00]  who's the one that marched off with a sign i wonder what they said when they brought that  one some baby from fucking martha i guarantee it was some baby from martha it was a guy i saw really  it was a guy but i don't know who it was a guy was a cute sal he's adorable does anyone know  does anyone know who the guy was no i only saw him from the back and when he took it someone's  of course yes uh why would it be your business to get all pissy about that take the sign go to a 
[00:31:30]  boss about it and then of course the boss caters to him and comes marching down and rips them all  down yeah if i was the boss i go look my guys are doing a dumb bit relax yeah they'll move on to  something else so will you see they're fired well is that what it was i want to know who complained  i think that was uh something to do with it because you know it's kind of like 
[00:32:00]  a bit is a bit but we should also be aware when somebody's feelings livelihood income is going to  be ending but they already know that so who cares yeah if they care so much don't fire the guy  right right exactly thank you jimmy are they gonna give another job on the platform yeah are  they gonna have the same tact when they rip your sirius xm badge off your belt right yeah and show  you and escort you by the way because that's what they do escort you to the fucking curb making you 
[00:32:30]  feel like a real piece of shit like a criminal or if you want to try to get your stuff out of your  office they're staring at you telling you what you can and can't touch those people you mean  when they're done with you they're done with you who cares yeah that's how it works here  when do you think gary will be aware that we're pissed at him again he's driving does he drive in  he takes the he takes the bus really yeah i don't want a guy taking the bus that oversees this channel 
[00:33:00]  oh boy a bus public transportation all right yeah you know what he's in the trenches there with  everybody else strap hanger right on a bus on a bus what is that why does he take a subway  he's a bus guy where's he come in from where's he come in from i don't know where he lives is it  near the city he doesn't live in the city no he's not a city guy he might have to take it from jersey  i don't know for sure maybe some of those buses are convenient yeah he takes a bus they get that lane 
[00:33:30]  where there's no traffic get your right to the zipper lanes yeah he puts his little headphones on  oh but his bald head he looks like a man of the future listening to transmissions from jupiter to  planet kultov i picture him just listening to everybody hurts on the bus oh yeah tears coming  out his fucking face as as he knows he has to come in here again there's hey he made the deal not  you know he was the one that took the fucking money there's tears coming down his face on that bus 
[00:34:00]  every day but what's going through his headphones is this show not everybody hurts that's true  it's like oh you think he's listening right now yeah hi gary well say gary safe trip he blew it  again oh boy let me tell you let me tell you something else this whole conversation is not  going to do eric any favors where's he whispered in my ear that he was going to go make a prep  sheet he's making one at 6 45 no that's his that's how he says he has to go duty yes i'm gonna go 
[00:34:30]  make a prep sheet a prep shit anyone else understand the lunacy of this  it just you got the prep sheet email like travis has been doing a really good job of even though  he's sick like sending stuff right but it's like here i couldn't yesterday i guess he was just too  i hope this helps uh-huh yeah like he's giving uh the basics and then assuming that someone step  up and fill in the other parts right and i mean like little nuggets that maybe other radio shows 
[00:35:00]  aren't finding he's apparently bedridden yeah he's on facebook's here his wife's bringing him soup and  he's just laying in bed yeah i hear this flu is a motherfucker i got a flu shot i got a flu shot  and uh so far i'm dodging oh yeah i don't think i'm gonna get the flu it's like if i'm gonna get it  right i think so too it was all around my house all around my family in philly yeah my kids one was  a fucking you know shitting peanut butter the other one was puking all over the place gosh it was  non-stop non-fucking-stop and then i had a christmas party with my family and they all not all but a 
[00:35:30]  bunch of them came over sick and i'm usually the first to get sick if you got the flu shot if i'm in  that environment i always go down man but this fucking flu shot is like i have a bit of a cough  happening that's not part of the flu though you don't really cough no it's part of aids oh good  thank god the aids it's the aids i woke up coughing i finally fell asleep i just woke up with a violet  cough i'm thinking anthony last year like oh boy oh it was terrible boo boo boo all right whatever 
[00:36:00]  alex jones will be calling at 8 30 that's pretty cool alex jones really knows how to get fucking  pressed man yeah yeah and he does he was trending all day yesterday on twitter he's uh he's a monster  that little exchange with peers about gun control he knows what he's doing and people like it was  terrible but you know what he he fucking that's the story well it's perfect for his business and for  his yeah for his audience and everything perfect i want to ask him one question though i want to ask him 
[00:36:30]  why he didn't like just try to tone it down because some of his facts certainly uh you know  it would have been interesting to hear what peers would have had to say about it but but the way he  said it you know no one was going to take him that seriously in that environment and when peers  started saying like what type of weapon was like i knew what peers was saying but it's like that  argument's been done it's like that's exactly why i think that's exactly why alex went off like that  no he goes off like that all the time though i don't think he could have toned it down and 
[00:37:00]  really hit him with some facts i think he wanted peers to even get that argument out the one that  he uses all the time uh he didn't even want him to get it one more time yeah peers does not have a  good second amendment argument like yeah i understand why you'd say certain weapons are bad but alex jones  takes that tact with everything there's a i think it's media uh this morning has like the top 10  alex jones videos of him losing his mind it's all it's about everything hilarious that's the way he goes  about it and i if it doesn't hurt his business so be it but it just seems like he had an opportunity 
[00:37:30]  there to kind of you know that that would have been shocking to peers if alex jones actually  fucking mellowed out and calmed down and hit him with what he knows you know what if you're alex  jones why go off fucking script just do what you usually do if it's working i got everyone talking  you know what it fucking worked for him yeah i'm gonna ask him i'm curious to what he would say  about that and you know i'll tell you something that's all no way peers is gonna out talk a radio  guy right who does his show by because he's like pharrell in that way like it's hard to talk that 
[00:38:00]  intensely for that long it's not easy to do man by yourself by yourself it's fucking hard yeah  yep and uh he fucking alice can go on you know and then there's a builder group and like he'll  fucking fit that dumb builder group into every discussion what did build a bear do is that build a  that build a bear group you always see like the kennedys going in and they come out with a  little bear i'll tell you it just seems like a very innocent uh right i don't get it it looks 
[00:38:30]  it's the most innocent store in every mall but all hell is breaking loose apparently i've heard tell  there's some conspiracy shit going on with build a bear it's a big distraction you think they're just  building bears apparently not you go behind uh those walls protesters outside and they're they're  working with the false flag wow false flag false and black ops and black oh god where's my list  from yesterday that was a good we have the alex jones video murder pill murder suicide murder pills 
[00:39:00]  i love them the new one yeah please so so now um i don't know if everyone has seen this i'll pretty  much most people have seen the the piers morgan alex jones uh uh thing now right after uh piers  morgan alex jones made a video because he got he had a producer cry yeah uh i hear that he he was  scared for his life he thinks that mayor bloomberg's gonna kill him with crackheads or something yeah  he loves a good conspiracy so he had to make a video of everything he was um feeling after the 
[00:39:30]  piers morgan interview cameraman or tripod does he get up in this i hope he stands up at some point  gets right in the camera it's a bit on the long side but without a prep sheet who gives a fuck oh  this will kill a few minutes yeah check and see what else you guys have to cover today yeah um you  think uh you rock we still working on the prep sheet yeah first out of the first out of the  you rock cast it but you're in here yeah i'm working on it here see oh okay that's why i go back to 
[00:40:00]  the radio wizard like we don't have enough people on staff right now you idiot radio wizard would  probably retort that generally prep sheets would be done the hour before the show not the first hour  of right yeah that's a good argument for him it's yeah it's a fair no oh boy fair argument what about  the other ten problems i have with you those are tougher to argue there you go alex jones let's  hit it we're in new york city and as you know just about an hour ago i was on camera 
[00:40:30]  they had promised me three segments if i came here and then i was going to debate alan dershowitz but  they panicked the producers ran in um the head producer oh well pause it there that's that's a good  spot i don't think they panicked i think they ran out of time because that first segment seemed to go  a lot longer than most uh segments yeah i watched cnn a lot it felt like it was a very long segment so  i think what happened when they said when he started going off they they probably said 
[00:41:00]  up fuck it let's make this a long segment and we'll we'll blow out the third segment yeah i think  it just sounds like every radio guy we've hated  pierce probably got tired of not being able to jump in like he knows that that's good for this for the  viewing but then by the second segment when there's no back and forth if i had to show i would be  like enough i can't have three of these but the audio is 12 minutes and then you you shove five  six minutes of commercials in there that's about 18 to 20 minutes of an hour show yeah that's that's 
[00:41:30]  a lot of time and that third segment thing if you're not getting any word like he was trying to like okay  you have to have a debate here and i think after the first one where he was kind of patient with it  he just got annoyed by the second one right i would too if i was him it could be that or they  simply ran out of time we all know how maybe produce tv shows and what's not true true producer  was crying and saying it wasn't supposed to be like this and pierce morgan was said get out of here  and their security people were like get out get out now you're coming with us and i said we'll have 
[00:42:00]  to get our stuff out of the green room that said you know i've covered bilderberg you know i've  covered that was i swear to god i swear to you i did not see this or hear this your future jimmy  you know that's hilarious because he always brings up bilderberg i know false flag i know  i love build the burger means i've known him for years he's very a great comic 
[00:42:30]  build the birds the new uh the new red-headed comedian he's bill of burr  or you're just using his middle name yeah we never knew his middle name until today  build the bird all right yeah i've been in the news coverage where people are being arrested  mass i've never put out a video asking for people to watch our back we got here today at about four  o'clock drove in from the airport into midtown your cnn's main complex they have several buildings 
[00:43:00]  and when we got to the hotel we were getting our cards and i noticed what was clearly off-duty  cops in the in the uh windbreakers with the you know guns talking into their little earpieces  they had earpieces and the little handheld pieces where's it i didn't say anything to rob  do who's running camera right now then about two hours before after dinner before we went down to  the cnn center we were walking around about 10 blocks away just shooting video of this and that 
[00:43:30]  and i noticed more undercover cops oh my god all right all right let's see come on this is a bit  right come on is he gonna come out someday with a book that this whole thing was a bit does he  honestly is he honestly thinking and saying i don't know that that that undercover cops were following  him because if no one's but why would they be undercover cops but you could tell they're  undercover cops right they were going to be undercover cops and they really want to take  a he can tell but they could they could just blend in way better than having a windbreaker and 
[00:44:00]  all their stuff on their side by dress being dressed like a cop you could blend in better right  trying not to look like a cop in new york city there's cops all over if you're dressing a cop people  probably just think you get some weirdly gay fetish village people type thing when you're  undercover it's obvious right what is he doing i don't know let's see where he goes  this is a whole this is great bit this is great so let's just go ahead and get out of here and then  they had him waiting for us about 300 yards from cnn the building we're going to when the guy runs 
[00:44:30]  up and kind of gets in our face and we all surrounded a few listeners as well but this  guy got in our face you can tell it was a big mean bloomberg detective i've been here at protests  before i've seen luke radowski's videos and it was like oh i'm a you know a big fan but it was like  pure violence in the eyes and dude's like man that guy was was scary i think that's a cop  and dude's shooting video right now he came to new york with me and i said yeah and then we got 
[00:45:00]  there and i saw some more outside the back entrance staring at us like gangsters they're like cops from  the movie goodfellas basically can you pause this and this is this is like but all those guys you're  talking about would would seat your way right yeah they don't want their guns taken away what  are you talking about no i don't know they're all their government because they work for mayor bloomberg  i don't know who they work for i don't know what they do half the guys that work for mayor bloomberg  don't like mayor bloomberg and what he stands for but he's just he's surprised he's a creepy fan 
[00:45:30]  the guy came up and he was a little bit violent in the eyes yeah well alex your fans are nuts you  attract the same type of people we do exactly look like an incest survivor yeah same folks overweight  yeah we yeah no girlfriend yeah we would be creeped out if a guy in a really nice suit came by  that didn't have an ounce of fat on him  that's where we would be creeped no he's not in town that's too bad man we should have figured this  out because having having him in studio would have been cool yeah why don't we get peers in i don't 
[00:46:00]  know if his uh if his uh schedule would have uh warranted that is pierce still here yeah he  broadcast from new york i wait how long has he broadcast from new york 18 years oh i thought he  was in la like larry i didn't realize that okay no he broadcast from new york i did not realize one  day i actually uh unofficially followed him across the park because i happened to be in the park with my  son and he was and he was walking and he would and i was gonna talk to him and i didn't should 
[00:46:30]  have got him to call in no this is a while this was in the summer no i'm saying today we should  no i know he's in he lives in new york is all i'm saying because i've seen him whatever i meant  nothing what i just said i know go ahead then we go up that all happens and i said listen i want to  go out the mall entrance because there's a mall entrance on the other side and the security head  of security said no you're going out this way and i said but bloomberg's guys are out there  i don't want any confrontations the guy started laughing at us like yeah and we got there and there they 
[00:47:00]  are you know talking into their pieces rob dude i'm going to flip this around and have you talk  sure uh can you describe yeah right once we walked out there was a guy with a windbreaker and he had  his little earpiece in and he was talking into his coat like this and as we walk out he looks at us  and then he kind of walks into the wall like he's trying to get out of our way but why is he walking  into a wall like he literally turned and walked but describe the other oh shit pause i mean there was  a guy bumped into i see what's happening yeah yeah yeah a guy bumped into a wall uh-huh and 
[00:47:30]  he was wearing a windbreaker yeah due to possibly inclement weather uh-huh i understand by the way  i know where cnn is he broadcast out of is it the time warner building right so when you walk in there  um they don't i know of one entrance to cnn it's in the mall it can you go through the oh yeah you  probably can you used to be able to i don't know i've never done maybe in general they just don't  want to use that uh only that it's literally a door where you see cnn and it's it's right in the 
[00:48:00]  mall i go to fox news all the time do shit over there it's there's security there's cops and then  there's fox news's security guys because it's a fucking it's a target it's a network the news  organization buildings in new york city are targets they have heavy security at them they're not there  for for alex jones coverage and probably a guy going all right we uh we got him meaning he's  you know they weren't even paying attention to him no they didn't care they don't it's not a 
[00:48:30]  bloomberg guy watching your every step and why would they be like what's he doing why would bloomberg  say dispatch these security agents and keep your eye on alex jones because he might they already  let him talk on cnn right like once you talk on before this is before even this is they're saying  this is before but you went on in cnn and talked i don't know i thought he got a tremendous amount  of his stuff out yeah i mean maybe there was more he wanted to say before the interview even starts 
[00:49:00]  right bloomberg's guys are following him here's what alex jones is but if bloomberg really didn't  watch in this city he would have figured that out right he's a paranoid guy he is a brilliant guy  i think so that's the question is this all a bit no i think because i don't know now i think it's a  combination yeah part of it is a bit like a bit that bit like hey let's fool people but this is  my thing and this is how i and he's stretching it a bit it'd be almost like if i was going on cnn  because they want to talk about hookers and i would just go like i'll go over the top describing the 
[00:49:30]  hookers i saw coming in all right because i know the segment has to be a certain way right and you  don't want to go well i came to new york and it was pretty so far pretty nice and i went in there  and uh everybody said hello that's not interesting but you know there's a guy in the windbreaker the guy  like that's a little bit more to talk about so he knows how to just pump it up yeah but i don't  think he says i'm being full of shit i think that he just it's kind of the way you train yourself to  think and see things it's always in terms of this is who i am so this is how i'm seeing things i don't 
[00:50:00]  think he's stupid or crazy he's an interesting guy and he's got some he definitely has some things to  you know make people think yeah but then this stuff and he goes throws you off and go all right he goes  way over the top yeah all right let's see what happened with the uh the guy in the windbreaker  he came up and approached us twice and that was the second time was really spooky because all of  a sudden he's there the first time we saw him approaching the second time he came from behind  well i forgot about that one but then there's all the other cases bottom line what do you think's  going on here i think we're being cased definitely i mean yeah yeah we're being cased and and the way 
[00:50:30]  this will work is oh see they're here protesting you know gun grabs oh some crack dealers shot  them and if you don't know that bloomberg's total mafia you're not living on oh my god planet earth  and reality and and these people clearly work for bloomberg is clearly police and there's some  other stuff that went on truth is stranger than fiction i'll just leave it at that i've never  that i can remember put out a video when i'm in foreign countries being followed by you know people  in black suvs and uh being arrested i've never followed you've seen it all i've never said we're 
[00:51:00]  in danger black suv by the way is a new show on bet starring richard belger  oh that is uh amazing he he honestly thinks bloomberg is casing him with his security  people right and that at some point a crackhead right will shoot him right in some type of you  know using a crackhead as a patsy kind of thing right in an assassination right and if you don't think 
[00:51:30]  bloomberg is mafia what like he's he would do shit like that he's mafia he's like veto on the  sopranos yeah he's gonna get caught in a parking lot yeah i'm a big fan of the mafia myself ah yeah  i guess i gotta like bloomberg a little more i saw his other man johnny cakes was right there next  to him johnny cakes oh my god committed suicide johnny cakes the actual play johnny cakes committed  to suicide did he why i'm guessing because he was so uh typecast yeah and that name johnny cakes 
[00:52:00]  hey johnny cakes he probably got that he's probably a serious actor and he just got tired of going hey  johnny cakes kill himself yeah that's terrible over that shit i'm guessing i really don't know jesus  man go go out to la and become a surfer before you do that yeah just chill out on the beach why would  you do that so many cool things you could do if you're just giving up who cares they call you johnny  cakes i don't know if that was it maybe it was a relationship i'd go down to the caribbean just 
[00:52:30]  make drinks on the beach hang not a care in the world at that point not even you might not have  that kind of money it's all good as hendel would say oh now i'm in a bad mood again oh that's on the  show prep talk about hendel i just got out of my bad mood now i'm back in a bad mood because you  brought up hendel again god damn it i understand alabama is uh is playing notre dame according to  the prep sheet yeah yeah how's that prep sheet going iraq iraq coming it's coming oh well what's 
[00:53:00]  what's it's seven o'clock yeah by the time i'm embarrassed by the time i gotta say i'm embarrassed  he's gonna write like what audio you have and you will have already played it played it yeah what  what are you prepping are you prepping for the jim norton show at 10 a.m that's right that's all  set and ready to go okay coach i like my people here early so you're writing show prep or synopsis  there's a difference you know  any word from uh the radio wizard i mean i haven't heard since he was young 
[00:53:30]  i encourage more uh more radio wizard song parodies by the way completely encourage that at this point  i would like to know why he took the signs i mean i i look because he doesn't get but i mean  we already know that this is a corporate thing where it's like if someone's it's a human resource is  did it get to that like did somebody threaten to go to them that's what i want to know i was probably  somebody who's losing their job oh it was very upset that there was a picture that with you as a 
[00:54:00]  cartoon putting the middle finger stop maybe they thought the cartoon didn't represent me properly  making it obviously an over-the-top bit from a dopey radio show yeah or an excellent radio show  dopey slash sometimes excellent exactly let's go alex jones what else you got for us alex  um rob's older son um you know he's younger than 10 never says daddy please don't go on the strip  my wife has never been this concerned uh and i'm like come on quit being paranoid and let me tell 
[00:54:30]  you we got imagine alex jones telling you all over who else has he said that to quit being paranoid  for alex jones that's how you quit being paranoid how nuts do you have to be a bad  shit for alex jones to say yes quit being paranoid being paranoid  i i i have to be i got him i have to say this officially this is a massive bit a massive bit  he has some intelligence he understands like we all do when we were growing up a good conspiracy 
[00:55:00]  got us all we love conspiracies yes and he has he has figured out a way to make it into a huge business  but he has to live his life all the time in that conspiracy world and he doesn't give a  fuck he's actually not trying to get anything done he doesn't give a fuck if he if he educates  the public to to to a point i think you're right where there could be actual change i think you're  right because i don't think a guy this nutty can run a business and run his life i'm sorry this is 
[00:55:30]  a brilliant fucking bit it's it's it's in the genre of a phil hendry yes where it's just where they  figured out this thing this niche they understand people will grab at this stuff he would be able to  survive in life being this paranoid i think it's a combination i do because he's a smart guy but he  doesn't what he's on like uh he made good points on peers he made some really good points you  couldn't be nuts and make those good points he doesn't care he doesn't care he's making good  points because i think he he knows in the end that nothing will ever change we're not we're never going 
[00:56:00]  to take uh people's guns away in this country i hope people understand that we will continue to  argue this until the whole country falls apart someday he's like a committed art bell like you know  art bell would always leave that crazy forum open for these right maniacs and he would kind  of you never really knew where he stood like you you knew that he was okay with them he didn't agree  with but he didn't make fun of the crazy alex jones is like art bell if he immersed himself in one of  those uh-huh worlds he's dealing with that segment of the population i think we're looking at a brilliant 
[00:56:30]  carny i really do i think i just want to go on record i think you're right i i really do i you know  i think he got into conspiracies uh you know when he was younger and and a light bulb went off in his  head like wait i can live in that world i like doing radio but i can live in that world yeah  i really do but i think also he's highly intelligent yeah he knows the deal he knows let's let's hear  because this is just too fucking nice it's crazy it's crazy but people would eat this shit up we're 
[00:57:00]  eating it up it's great yeah yeah you know and everybody said you better watch it you're going  to bloombergstown you know this big they meant cover your asshole gangster type guy so that said  we're here and we're leaving tomorrow whatever happens happens i think putting this video out  will protect us and oh my god it was just super creepy because uh you know when when cops come over  and grab me by the arm and go i'm a big fan you know what i mean i'm a big fan and then you look 
[00:57:30]  there's another cop right there and they're going yeah big fan big fan i mean this this country's  gone folks this is why we have the second amendment and then dershowitz came on the  guy that wrote memos calling for torture of anybody that disagrees basically and that they have torture  warrants alan dershowitz i was supposed to debate him after pierce morgan panicked as i predicted he  would do by the third segment they're not predicting a third segment kicked me out by the third segment  they broke their promise which i expected you went after their money master see the problem is people  say why don't you be nice to them they're thugs i know who they are i mean i know about pierce morgan 
[00:58:00]  and the insider trading reports out of england i think five or fake news reports and fleeing justice  and the hacking scandals and then my wife called me because i'm i'm dealing with all these police  detectives and the rest of it and she goes are you hearing this and i later was able to go watch the  video right before we did this where they're going alex is the reason we take the guns he's not safe  you know he'll shoot people i mean i have no criminal record my guns are all locked up don't  even really think about them it's that when they come after our guns as thomas geverson said that's 
[00:58:30]  when you know you're going into tyranny and i called my dad uh you know he saw it and he said yeah you  gotta go watch this video and dershowitz and i wouldn't watch it it was like alex shows is dangerous  you know we've got to deal with him he shouldn't have guns uh you know he'll he'll he'll go after  people i mean here they are diane feinstein says let's take mr and mrs america's guns it's us folks 
[00:59:00]  it's the ruling corrupt insider trading congress and all these globalists with with all the derivatives  they're a mafia and i've got guys out of central casting that are police in fact i saw once is  windbreaker flapped up and there was the 40 right there oh i got cops on windbreaker i don't even  get speeding tickets every few years but if they have control of the weather why would they allow  the wind to blow his windbreaker right yeah there's no way a guy is flashing and brandishing a weapon 
[00:59:30]  like that in new york no sorry it just oh god that's hilarious the wind blew it up and he saw the 40  come on shut up he meant it was a fucking old english yeah it just didn't happen he's hilarious  i love him i love him i've turned the corner on him this is great stuff ever since i heard he likes  old motorhead i've i've enjoyed all his shows i don't buy into any not a word none of it i think uh 
[01:00:00]  i think it's a massive yeah yeah yeah this is like uh this is like trying to get the  fucking basketball into the hoop at the corner yeah that's all squished yeah but that guy's  going to convince you that it's possible step right up uh we got three darts throw the darts  at the balloon you're popping you get a prize he's what he's a great car hurry hurry hurry yeah  if something happens to us we're killed by crackheads it was the nycd or mafia they hired 
[01:00:30]  wait what was that i mean this could you let me hear that again what are you in new york in 1986  i love him jesus christ somebody breaks metallica's first album over my head  we might have a morton downey jr uh uh thing on our hands eventually very good yes where he does  something you think he'll do something to himself it was morton downey june jr the kkk the nazis  was it kkk in his forehead they know swastika and it was backwards it was backwards because 
[01:01:00]  he put it on his own head and he did it in a mirror oh god that was great then he got a fess  up that he did it himself uh all right there was the 40 right there i got cops on me and i'm known  folks i don't even get speeding tickets but every few years so just if something happens to us we're  killed by crackheads it was the nypd or mafia they hired period and i mean this city runs white 
[01:01:30]  slaves that sex slaves out of here all day this city narcotics you name it this is mafia central  and i came here and told the mafia and sure i didn't do a perfect job but at the best i could  i came here i told the mafia you can go to hell so alex jones reporting from the front lines the fight  for this republic right here in new york towards washington fought the british points 15 to 1 odds  what's very funny you put odds on the revolutionary war 15 to 1 odds yeah i'll take the i'll take the 
[01:02:00]  british points yeah back i'll take the blacks and the under uh the 13th amendment that's hilarious  you see george washington's girlfriend  quite the looker and uh his wooden teeth blew up and showed his gums  15 to 1 odds he rules man knows the odds of the revolutionary war this is great  he's talking about new york the way you thought of new york in the 80s right the way new york was  thought of is like he it's like he just saw that movie central uh was it with times square or whatever 
[01:02:30]  it was uh any of those gritty fucking new york i just saw a movie there's gangs all over yeah  there's one they dress like the yankees and there's one they roller skate yeah i don't  oh i don't think he comes to new york often new york in the 80s i don't get the yeah i don't get  the feel yeah because it's not uh but he's talking to people who don't know anything about  new york and they see new york that way too like new york you just get beat up on time square there's  a bunch of hookers on 42nd street muggings in central park yeah and the mafia would never allow 
[01:03:00]  you to talk like this well you know the cops are following him and the mafia wouldn't care if you're  going after guns no none of their guns are legal anyway they don't give a right oh boy go to hell  so alex jones reporting from the front lines the fight for this republic right here in new york  george washington fought the british 15 to 1 odds he cheated win every battle he lost most of them  and he persevered and that was what was important and i just hate tyrants and bullies how long have 
[01:03:30]  we been going here dude seven minutes here is my little notes i never even got to with pierce morning  and i want to go over some of these i wrote these on the computer yesterday i wrote some of the  plane oh i guess his printer i'm gonna open stats pause yeah jam printer uh i couldn't get my notes  out now that it's 7 15 how we doing on that prep sheet york york comment almost done oh name tell  me one of the stories or should we just wait to get them all together oh we should get them all 
[01:04:00]  let's go get them i can't wait i can't wait to see those little nuggets that'll make this show a  little special today it's like christmas yes what stories story number one alex jones makes a  video oh we should go to that it should technically be on the prep sheet should be  radio wizard check in and make sure everything's running smoothly i because at this point he's got  to think all hell i got a text from him no oh from who of just my friend oh 
[01:04:30]  he hasn't even checked in yet knowing that all hell's breaking laws no i also got a text but i mean  it was like jam it wasn't from him it was so he still has no idea he probably knows now he's aware  i would think yeah go ahead uh i went over the stats that they hate that guns are like number 15 and  cause of unnatural death number one suicide because of all the prozac type drugs they admit  you got to that alex unnatural death i wanted to get to that i covered some of it victim disarmament the 
[01:05:00]  government's the one that disarmed the schools and advertised them as places to go kill people  fast and furious 20 000 guns rocket launchers and then he hits you with the real fact what he's  saying they're advertising that's that's what we have talked about on our show the media is making  it like look this is right if you're a crazy person and why hang yourself in your stupid parents  basement when you could go out in a blaze of fucking glory right that is a good point which he makes he  makes those good points in there but it's in the midst of a fucking uh soup of nuts right 
[01:05:30]  crazy he's a crazy mother but it is i think it's a total bit guys as nutty as a bunch of fruit cakes  fucking right on right on the money there chipper and i i bet you he started um his radio career in  this conspiracy thing really thinking that i could change things yeah and then realize holy  fuck the system is so fucking broken i'm just wasting my time but i could certainly immerse  myself in this world he got a great career and and you know start a website i'll give him the plug 
[01:06:00]  info wars and it'll be great it'll be a big business for him yep you only reminds me he had good intentions  i bet that probably back whenever you started he reminds me of a guy who's play acting like but not  i don't i don't think he's a fake like i really think almost like him and the other guy both kind of on  some level no but they're living in this world where it's like we we this is our thing like i  like i but i don't think he's being a total fake but i think deep down he knows those guys were not 
[01:06:30]  threatening him but he'll just see those cops they'll come up to him and they'll go did you see  that guy and the other guy they both kind of know this world they've immersed themselves in  and the other guy will go yeah they're playing their roles yeah but not even being fake to each other  not being phony it's just they both kind of know this is who we are and this is what we talk about  right um and instead of you know maybe having a real discussion about they just go no let's just  we're both gonna just assume that this is a guy following us today because they both know we're 
[01:07:00]  gonna talk about this on the radio sure like alex like that that guy came right up to me and the  guy like yeah it could be undercover and blah blah blah and it's just i think it's just kind of  lived out like like you know how we role play chip sometimes we're doing comic-con  we both like you don't actually say to me while i'm being chip hey that's a fake  we both i'll go like what the fuck and you'd be like you don't think so like we're both kind of  just joking but we both know what they're doing that on a serious it's fake and when you're on the  radio you pump it up yeah and then we make love i only mean about 95 of the stuff i say about uh  the radio wizard 95 it's not bad a little higher than 95 96 and a half okay alex johnson 
[01:07:30]  gun shop delivered down there by the white house blame the second amendment um pierce is in the  news having bodyguards he said he didn't have bodyguards that'll be a whole other report that  that's not true drone attacks killing children all over the world but obama doesn't cry for that  democide killing 290 million people government's number one threat you did cover that i did cover  that i covered it all but not as much as i'd like we have guns to protect ourselves from you i made 
[01:08:00]  that point move to north korea if you don't like guns fbi crime stats covered that called him a  hatchet man government arming to the teeth the 1.6 billion bullets preparing for civil unrest  you have blood on your hands again because they disarmed the schools and advertised them as killing  zones why are americans buying guns we don't trust you anymore you've lost the trust of the people  amber lyon three-time emmy award-winning news producer for cnn found out that bahrain was paying 
[01:08:30]  money to cnn to kill her reports about them lining peaceful protesters up and machine gunning them with  government guns why uh i thought that i was going to be debating dershowitz so i was going to say hey  you said we should torture anybody the government wants i mean what a monster he's quote a liberal  well he's liberal so it's okay to torture and have drone attacks it's just all a big game  um arrested if you're politically incorrect uh that's the kind of stuff he's been calling for they  were implying it again tonight uh all of the nsa wiretapping i was going to point out how in england 
[01:09:00]  they've gotten rid of free speech i was i talked about feinstein saying that she would uh  uh yes take away your guns want to disarm mr and mrs america i know right diane feinstein mr mrs  america then the third day i was on i was just yeah i wanted to get into uh the a-rod uh what a bad  move that was when he was with the mariners and jay buehner whatever happened to jay buehner did he  retire edgar martinez would always uh single up the middle and i'm right john wetland was a good 
[01:09:30]  closer i thought rivera was overused in 97 we heard you what's time do you think you have  this is almost over mr mrs america get ready to turn your guns in that was just some of what i  wanted to cover uh i'm not obsessed with guns i've been brought up my whole life with them to where  i'm quite frankly bored with them i like video cameras i like to videotape like christmas tree 
[01:10:00]  lights you know outside at night i like to videotape the stars i like to videotape uh lego  stop start animation i just i just know that when they come for the guns it's it's all about enslavement  and i just don't know what to say anymore i mean really i live in a country where i'm being cased and  followed by men with guns who want my guns oh boy as a citizen you can't own guns if you live in new  york city but i had guys in windbreakers all day and i don't want to freak do out at first 
[01:10:30]  they were following us and finally it just got so ridiculous they wanted us to know  i mean these guys were like hey man i'm a big fan i'm really like the mafia i really want to take  care of you and your family you understand that i really want to you know he's really uh menacing  it up you got a 40 cal sig right there 40 cal hk or whatever yeah i got one of those i mean it's  like they got their guns and they don't want me having a gun and you know what they're smart 
[01:11:00]  you're smart because you're not going to run your bs in places like texas no matter what you try  no matter how many false flags you may have domesticated people in new york city  but you don't have people out in the heartland all across this country from the north carolina  to tennessee the camera goes away and close northern california where the girls are warm  southern illinois we're wise to you you may have bankrupted our pensions and stole our country's  freedoms and sold us out of the new world order but you haven't physically conquered us yet 
[01:11:30]  you know you bloomberg mafia people can go straight to hell  bloomberg i know you made billions off insider deals you know what you got a bunch of armed  men protecting you but you don't want women out there in the heartland america to protect themselves  from all the crackheads by the cia crackheads you know what you go to hell all you all the  thugs in their suits yeah i've gotten your red coat usurper hatchet man's face and told him to go to  hell all right that's it pray for us ladies and gentlemen pray when you get back to austin texas

[01:15:00]  waves the doors never open up and throw him inside just waits for the walk side that's right crosses  the street he looks behind him he sees two men dressed in black walking a little faster faster faster  yeah and then they just pass them yeah they just pass them because they're in a hurry right  they're late for a meeting it's a truckload of black lacquer and he realizes oh my hair dye is on its  way lacquer his hair on a lego person oh god this is hilarious here to say and i don't buy into it  yeah i i buy into it as far as a really really good radio yes an angle yes a very good carny

[01:28:00]  broadcasting well i i said she would have a half million by today but damn it's probably  going to be well short i don't know just because she had two thousand followers when this whole  thing started 215 000 all right 215 000 followers just because brent musburger uh  was being as they say a creep a creep i thought brent musburger was uh 
[01:28:30]  fine with what he had  you're obsessed with that i think i so am why you don't know what if the guy is  fucking never stupid four minutes infected douche um do we have the original clip yeah all right  now when you're a quarterback at alabama you see that lovely lady there she does go to auburn i love  her with that but she also miss alabama and that's aj mccarran's girlfriend okay okay right there on the 
[01:29:00]  right is dd bonner that's aj's mom wow i'm telling you quarterbacks you get all the good looking women  eyes what a beautiful woman wow he's aj's doing some things right so if you're a youngster in  alabama start getting the football out and throw it around the backyard with pops  now uh what he said was perfectly fine yeah sure i think he was being complimentary i don't think he 
[01:29:30]  was being creepy at all she's obviously a beautiful woman and then obviously he ends the whole thing  with a little joke get the football and start throwing around the backyard with your dad  he was having fun with the dumb thing and by the way he wasn't running the camera someone  put the camera on her because she was fucking hot it was a blowout of a game i mean the game was  pretty much over by the uh by halftime so you know he's he's trying to come up with whatever the  fuck he can to get uh people staying staying tuned to the game yeah but now they're calling him a creep 
[01:30:00]  brent musburger has been on tv since i was a little forever nothing man it's got to be 50 years  and you're a child of the 80s that's right and by the way if that was a female announcer talking  about how dishy some football hunk is i wonder if they'd still be saying it's creepy yeah no  there's a double standard which we've pointed out many times in the show and the woman is miss alabama  or whatever right she's she's in that world in that world she's in the world where you're supposed  to go wow that's a beautiful broad she wears a bikini yeah they put that part of her job is to  wear a bikini now you can't compliment an attractive woman no no we're emasculated 
[01:30:30]  fuckwads now yeah she goes she's in passion  and stuff they put that silly talent crap in there to make believe that it's more important  than what it really is where you're looking at her ass and her eyes and her tits and her  fucking hair and you bitches want to know why we don't want you in the workplace that's why and  in the garages and in our private clubs because you have to get up right exactly sal so so we don't  coming fucking mo that's a little weird a little weird i must say uh espn or cbs is apologizing for 
[01:31:00]  what brent musburger said he's been on tv for fucking ever holy  shit what a no reason to apologize thing what where's the apology do we have that story in our  what fucking worms this country let me country of worms worms let me see if we got that in our prep  because that's a big story today so stupid holy shit does anyone have it and this all started  because women wanted to be in the workplace and they get offended they want to be just like one 
[01:31:30]  of the boys and then fuck everything up that the boys want to do at work or at a club or at the golf  course or anything else how come people say that we're not as fun or we're not fun that's why brent  musburger should be able to oogle a pretty girl in the stands like that and talk about how attractive  she is he didn't even say anything disrespectful no he was saying wow look the guy's got himself a very  pretty girl she's a and she's a beauty pageant winner right what an unnecessary apology i don't see 
[01:32:00]  the apology oh e rock it's it actually isn't that big of a story i mean oh that's true she's only on  the front page of the paper is she i didn't notice so jerked off to it's funny they don't apologize for  the way they cover uh the fucking that that uh kid who did the newtown shoot they don't apologize  uh-huh for contributing to mass murders right by fucking uh showcasing these people and by covering  it in ways that's been proven to contribute to more but they apologize for brent musburger wanting 
[01:32:30]  to fuck a beauty contestant right you got the apology yeah what is uh what are they saying we always  try to capture interesting storylines and the relationship between an auburn grad who is miss  alabama and the current alabama quarterback certainly met that test however we apologize that the  commentary in this instance went too far and brent understands that you know what you know brent  doesn't understand that and this company could go fuck themselves how about you how about for once

[02:01:00]  one up yeah i'd rather have my leg uh shake yeah you just shake your leg at night a little bit  i think i got some of that shaky leg oh i shake my legs all the time in bed i love it i think i  shake the i like to take the sheets and with my feet and i i swish them and swirl them yeah yeah  yeah yeah yeah is that something like that yeah that's with why you have the one tuck one no tuck  ah i like the no tuck because i take the sweet sheets and switch them and swirl them my legs do 
[02:01:30]  my legs do shake yeah and i'm like what the and some girl was like what what does that mean you hokey  pokey and you oh god jimmy i don't even know what that was i'll tell you what that was  uh-huh a monumental bomb  eric will probably pull it for line of the line of the day oh yeah i hear you're really stinking up  the joint with why in the day eric do you know you got fucking called out on twitter for fucking up 
[02:02:00]  the whole line of the day segment it doesn't even resemble the the actual line of the day segment  that we used to have anymore comment anything resemble what we used to have anymore oh no but  the point is with a question this is not a this is like the guy at the bridge that you gotta ask  a question before you can cross you're nursing around yeah well um didn't even address it of  course why would you yeah why don't you address it stop nursing around i was too busy doing the prep 
[02:02:30]  sheet yeah it's almost the prep sheet almost done fucking cock fucker uh mirror packs is a bad one  causes impulse control disorders and hyper sexuality hyper is that commercial for your  packs what is hyper sexuality no bucko that's shannon bucko that's hyper  hypo she writes hyper sexuality although shannon could be a guy that's a girl name  could be a guy could be a girl fucking girl name guys let me look at the avatar let me see 
[02:03:00]  be mad let me see mirror packs yeah something like that love that they put out pulp fiction by the  way  this shannon has a beautiful daughter  yeah it looks like uh pirates fan  so weird what you could know about a person yeah but checking out their twitter  don't have it m-i-r-a-p something m-i-r-a-p and then figure it out from there maybe an  e-x or something like that some shit like that m-i-r-a-p-e-x i believe 
[02:03:30]  oh you found it let's see if uh the listener helps us or hurts us today i say hurt you're  gonna go with hurt i'm gonna go with hurt i'm gonna go with oh every day you count on your  legs to get you where you want to go nice but when you suffer from restless leg syndrome your legs  don't want to stop even when you do annoying sensations can keep you up at night when all you 
[02:04:00]  want to do is get some rest fortunately there's miropex miropex is a prescription medicine that  helps relieve the frequency and severity of many rls symptoms like those irritating sensations and the  uncontrollable urge to move sounds good so your legs feel better and you feel better all right  prescription miropex may cause you to feel drowsy or fall asleep during normal activities such as  driving or to feel faint or dizzy when you stand up tell your doctor if you experience these problems 
[02:04:30]  if you drink alcohol or taking medicines that make you drowsy or if you experience increased gambling  sexual or other intense urges anthony other side effects include nausea talk to your doctor  who's slipping me this shit because when your legs feel better you feel better  someone's fucking someone's putting a slipping me a mickey it's the illuminati yeah uh okay that  sounds good gambling and sexual urges it's a fun drug it is but you could like pass out doing normal 
[02:05:00]  activities and tell your doctor if that happens but what if the first time that happens is when you're  driving to your doctor how ironic yeah but they sell a shitload of this stuff it's uh  amazing how we have just become dependent on drugs yeah we could keep going everyone has their  favorite i guess if you feel like our point if you go to your doctor and you feel like and you and  and you don't leave with a prescription you don't feel like you did anything right right like like i  think we're in a we're in a place here where where when you go to the doctor for something you expect to 
[02:05:30]  get a fucking medication yep and if he just says all right well i'm gonna need you to to maybe exercise  that my arm hurts or i got a tingle or a fucking something if you said well move it or take a  weight and lift it every day for you'd be like give me a pill motherfucker you would go find someone  else or i feel like i i'm i'm unhappy all right how about you fucking what are you doing with your  life how about you you try i don't know bettering your your life yourself your job no give me a 
[02:06:00]  fucking pill you know what dr steve kind of pissed me off a couple years ago that whiny scent because  i was i i had trouble sleeping like mr jim norton here yeah and i was talking about it and i was  mad when he told me once you try meditating or working out later in the day he gave me all these  normal things to try fuck that and in my brain i was thinking if i'm talking to a doctor i want him to  say yeah it looks like you need a sleeping pill then i would go to my doctor and get the sleeping 
[02:06:30]  pill yeah but he pissed me off because he's he went the other way but i tried it his way and it  does work if he told me i wanted a quick i wanted the quick fix which would be get get me on a stupid  sleeping pill so i could sleep he gave me the same thing for for clogged bowel this is what he says  why don't you try meditating meditate i'm bleeding from the anus we'll work out later  yeah your anal seepage can be fixed by meditating 
[02:07:00]  work out later in the day so they can clean the seat before the next guy  but it goes to your point i got mad yeah because it's in your head like okay something's wrong with  me there's a quick fix for everything all right time to figure out what pill i need because everyone  else has the their pill right i think it's affecting our um society to tell you the truth  my friends and this is what alex jones was talking about the suicide murder pills you know  you get some of these side effects you get somebody that might be on the edge but never 
[02:07:30]  would have done anything and then they take these suicide murder pills and you know suicide murder  i was at cvs getting a dumb prescription the other day no you weren't just some stupid silly  who gives a dang and as i was waiting i saw the tech valtrex valtrex sure from swamp lip oh i thought  you meant for genital herpes oh no god no i only got on my fucking lip you haven't gotten those in a  long time though right no because i got my my my shit together man the old days it was healthy you

[02:19:30]  gladly continue to do so alex uh we're all very glad that you're alive after your experience in new  york yeah yeah we saw the video afterwards and uh you were genuinely fearful of your life in new  york city sure i mean let's be clear uh i've been to bilderberg many times we've had the guys in black  sedans following us we've had you know the marines uh pointing guns at us we've i mean i've been to a  lot of places but it was like something out of a movie where you know cops would step out of alleyways 
[02:20:00]  i'd be like let's go down this street and there'd be another plainclothes cop all around cnn up to  like seven eight blocks away they'd go hey big fan big fan and grab my hand and just look at me like  i want to kill you what do you think their end game was like what were they trying to do  scare you why would they let you know they were there though they were trying to scare us and  so my bottom line was quite frankly after the interview i said let's get our stuff we're flying  out of newark let's go stay at a hotel by the airport and i actually got out of there oh really 
[02:20:30]  wow you couldn't take it anymore yeah well i mean look i'm not a whip at the same time if i can get  myself out of a position where it's a corrupt city with a corrupt mayor in control i'm gonna get out of  of yeah yeah we're not we're not we're not accusing you of anything sir you live in a much  scarier world than uh certainly we do no no i mean i wasn't talking about you guys and i was talking  about the aussie thing i mean i oh no and uh jimmy uh took that as a massive compliment i certainly did 
[02:21:00]  exactly and it's it's uh totally the truth i gotta tell you something i loved what you did on pierce uh  morgan's show because that guy has the same line over and over again about his view on gun control which  is gun confiscation and you went in there and i loved the fact that you wouldn't let him do that  same friggin line over and over again and and and hit him with facts and you came across very rational  i liked it very rational well look i mean i'll be honest with you also had a chest cold i still have  it when i was in new york had one hell of a headache and you know they had the cops messing with 
[02:21:30]  they probably hit you with ricin on the way through the tsa no no i i think i was probably hit with uh  something else before i even got on the plane you know called all the pollen in the air but  seriously guys seriously have you have you seen the new stuff the video is up at infowars.com yes  it's only about a 30 second clip last night they had the daily beast columnist on there saying that  i need to be killed with a rifle that piers morgan yes to shoot me and piers morgan agreed i'm not 
[02:22:00]  kidding it's an infowars.com what is going on uh alex what is going on  with uh guns in this country with our uh a right being taken away well i tried to give peers from  fbi.gov the last 15 years of statistics over 20 drop in the last 15 years about 12 of that in the  last five alone since 2007 and he just didn't want to respond overall violent crime overall violent 
[02:22:30]  crime with guns is down massively and the fbi has a map it's state by state it's concealed  carry it's higher gun ownership criminals now will knock your window out when you're not there and  take the purse out of your car your wallet or your you know playstation if you leave it in there  whatever but they don't do the home invasions all over the country because they know most houses  have got people with guns exactly who know how to use them plus with all these first shooter video  games which the pentagon originally developed most people you know now that have guns even if they 
[02:23:00]  don't shoot a lot know damn well how to use them i love uh call of duty by the way i play it all the  time i i don't like the idea that video games are uh perpetuating this uh mass murder thing i think  it's more bull bullshit just like the assault weapons that aren't used that statistically are not used  yeah yeah i think that i don't say censor them and i agree with you partially what i'm saying is  i was raising the video game saying that they were originally developed that first person shooter 
[02:23:30]  this is our record by the pentagon to get people really good shooting it's like a flight simulator so  my point is we've got 150 million americans and especially the 30 40 young uh adults that are all  video game players who are i mean they've got studies showing the shooting is getting better and better and  better and better and it's because people are on shooting simulators now one out of a billion or  you know one out of 50 million whatever the real numbers are but very rarely you're going to get 
[02:24:00]  somebody who's already mentally ill and who's on a bunch of different hardcore anti-psychotic right  who then sits there and plays one of these uh shoot them up simulators it's like a flight simulator  and they're going to then you know go off a demon but you can't blame the video of course not  you can't blame the gun exactly but that's what they're doing you got to blame the murder uh  suicide pills we just did a whole segment on our show about uh pills and uh side effects and side  effects everything that could happen to you for just taking care of your arthritis 
[02:24:30]  well you know it says on the major serotonin reuptake inhibitor uh inserts mania insanity uh  rages uh yeah suicide murder and then we're going to put listen i said this months ago it's now  officially come out denver post the batman crazy homes guy a whole bunch of prescription  psychotropics listen they're psychotropic they're in the hallucinogen class and if you're a normal 
[02:25:00]  person who doesn't have something psychotic lurking yeah for a lot of people those pills aren't even  bad for them but you give them to the wrong person and then the media hypes up all day hey don't go  you know just commit suicide or don't go commit suicide by cop the way to do it an option a b or  c is go to a school and shoot a bunch of little kids and you made a great point on cnn where the  media certainly helps uh helps this you know by uh glorifying the shooter why is that never looked 
[02:25:30]  at alex a lot of times the press will use video games guns everything even even the they'll delve into  the psychological and um uh medication thing but they never talk about how the the their reporting  itself might be influential to these people that go out and shoot i want to completely ignore that  because that's bad for business right alex jones no no i mean that's it and and and they're they're  not talking about the real issues that actually affect everybody and and this is what affects you  guys and affects your listeners diane feinstein's introduced bill along with 11 others and she's 
[02:26:00]  letting over the committee senator feinstein's bill says that they make you take all your guns  you already legally bought through the fbi nicks which is a registration folks of the basic type  you know long gun shotgun or handgun but they they know what you bought they know it's at the store  now get this her bill says that at the atf's discretion when you have to bring your guns into 
[02:26:30]  them and let me tell you one time they sent me a letter saying a gun you bought here  the serial number has an issue bring it to our offices so i went over the austin office and let  me tell you something it was not fun okay this was like visiting with the goodfellas the point is  we're all going to have to bring our legal guns into them and then we're registered and  fingerprinted with the atf but it gets worse there's a provision in there where it says that they may  make us turn them in and she wants two billion dollars a year to pay us on the barrel head right 
[02:27:00]  no judge no jury the atf is now god just like a no fly list you don't do anything wrong you're just  put on it suddenly you they make you turn your gun in and then i'm sitting there with peter's morgan  going i don't want to confiscate your firearms i i just want some reasonable  there's a great yeah yeah terrific a lot uh alex i i i agree with you a hundred percent on that they  have this buyback it's good they want to have a buyback program where not only you can't be 
[02:27:30]  grandfathered in anymore with your guns if you own a gun even with the assault weapons ban that  went in place during clinton if you had the gun you could keep the gun but now they're talking about  confiscating the guns that would be on this uh uh ban list well that would keep a lot of people  safe from no it wouldn't but these are so these alleged assault weapons aren't used in the majority  of crimes less guns less gun violence but he didn't want to hear it less guns less gun violence  they're only using about four percent yes murders and most of those are people uh you know in gang 
[02:28:00]  related stuff and then cnn last night said elec dang them style because he said it's it's uh you know  gang related well my point is it's not little kids no gangsters killing each other like al capone  and bugsy siegel but you're absolutely right about this yeah so-called assault rifles and semi-autos  of the type they're talking about banning are in less than four percent and i kept trying to raise that for  him and then they say we want to be like chicago where they've taken all the guns and are the  murder capital yeah the highest murder rate in the country and meanwhile uh assault weapons people 
[02:28:30]  don't understand they're not you don't walk into a store and buy a full automatic machine gun but the  the news would like you to believe that they are the same guns that are used in hunting their  semi-automatic long rifle it has nothing it's just that they look like a military weapon and uh that's  what scares people well exactly look feinstein and and pelosi and all and they know feinstein's on  record you can pull this up but she has bodyguards she has a concealed carrying yep there's clips of 
[02:29:00]  clinton there's clips of uh obama there's clips of biden all saying i'm never going to come after  your guns and there's clips of obama four years ago saying your rifle not your shotgun not your handgun  i pledge i will never come after those and so you go tell everybody that people saying that are liars  when he was state senator he answered newspaper questionnaires you know where they ask senators  what they do in the state he said i believe in the total abolition of civilian ownership of firearms  and guess who else agrees in march the u.n treaty is set to be ratified by the senate yep and the u.n 
[02:29:30]  treaty is open to their interpretation but in the original unidere plans they explain it uh july 7 2001  they said the civilian ownership of firearms threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the  state and we want worldwide civilian total disarmament absolutely nice on a global scale  and and uh how does that help us and and these people that are willing to just throw their rights 
[02:30:00]  away without even any uh information or knowledge about what they're giving up uh astounds me i'm sick  of the i'm sick of the musket argument i'm sick of the militia argument these are twisting the words of  the constitution they couldn't have been simpler when they wrote the second amendment and they're  twisting this around to make it where uh they're trying to say that we never had the right to bear  arms when in in in truth that's exactly what we have the right to do that shall not be infringed so 
[02:30:30]  the solution uh is that we should all go out and buy a gun i would love that i you know uh yes they  had professor lot that morgan wouldn't let talk when he was on a few weeks ago yeah and see that's  why i blew up at him i loved it well i mean here's some of the backside story because this is really  important if you guys have a little bit of time tell this i mean i knew they were lying the whole  time they go oh we want to be real friendly and uh and i said let me guess you're gonna have victims  families on before me oh boy and they go oh no and then of course they did and i said i said okay i  said fine i'll come and then they said oh no we're going to give you three segments we're going to let 
[02:31:00]  you a debate alan darshowitz who says that the government should be able to arrest whoever they  want and torture people and then when i get there uh they're basically oh change the plans this this  and that's going to happen and then after all this happened if anybody wonders who really did win that  debate the main producer was crying when it was over screaming get out get out other people were  hyperventilating and piers morgan as god is my witness was shaking because everyone walks into those big 
[02:31:30]  studios and just grovels like they've come in the presence of yes yes yes because a brit you know  has like a snot nose nose and i said this on my own radio show yesterday i said we need to build a  giant new washington monument after piers morgan's nose and then we can all as a sacrament suck the  snot out of it yeah i need to know at any time did you feel like uh piers was going to punch you  oh well uh did you see it hold on hold on hold on hold on because you know when you're in those 
[02:32:00]  situations did you see it in his eyes that he would have loved to take a shot at you  at the end of the interview i said i knew you'd freak out and wouldn't go to the third segment  chickened out like i predicted and his face like in a movie around the eye and the cheek did that twitch  jiggle and it wasn't a fake one i mean it was like a real twitch like a bond bad guy and he said you're  done and i said you're not going to defeat us and he literally laughed like yeah that's what you  think and then i told him i said listen you are nothing but a gangster and you're not going to 
[02:32:30]  disarm us i know this is about enslavement and they were just screaming with security get out  get out and they had some kennedys there we were like little cowering in the hallway by the green  room and darshowitz walked by me and i said you're a disgrace for promoting torture at the end of the  bill of rights oh yeah doushowitz yeah exactly um i'm kind of glad uh you didn't debate him  he he he'd really twist shit around why i don't like that that would have been a good time 
[02:33:00]  the second amendment means i don't get to have guns exactly but i'm dangerous and shouldn't own  guns yes and then they freaked out when they said that i have 50 guns well yeah i mean i've got like  five or six for my grandpa five or six my dad bought me over the years i collect them and you  know most of them have doubled or tripled in value yeah i mean i got a 50 cal i bought 10 years ago  it's like tripled in value i just bought another barrett i got a bear i got i have the barrett 50  also i have a desert eagle 50 i and it's fantastic by the way i i didn't even bring this up gawker 
[02:33:30]  last night published my name on their site because i am a concealed uh license holder in in new york city  uh so they're trying to terrorize you yes persecute us yes they had the guy last night on there that  wrote uh friday night lights i forget his name he said let's kill alex jones and peter's morning's  like yes yes i mean it's they're they're insane and and you're the one that shouldn't have guns  they're actually saying that you should be killed and they're afraid of you and your guns with a gun 
[02:34:00]  the fbi statistics are very accurate as far as the uh the the murder rate and and things like that  i just don't even know what to say anymore about these people i mean i'm sitting here let me tell you  this story i'm sitting there and i i live on the edge of the country so my satellite was out because  of a thunderstorm gotta love that so we so we're watching cnn online in in the bedroom the kids are  all sitting there we're sitting there eating dinner and and i've got a four-year-old i've got a eight-year-old 
[02:34:30]  and they're on the show and they go i just hope alex jones's kids don't get shot it was clearly a  threat and i'm like holy man man and then and my wife's like come on that's not a veiled threat  i go these people are creepy i go you watch and then as sure as the sun came up this morning they  cut to the next guy and he the the daily beast uh sports editor and he literally says you need to  shoot alex or pop him with an with an ar-15 semi-auto and then the uh the daughter of uh huntsman 
[02:35:00]  the the little model she goes oh yeah i want you to wear a uniform and when you do it that's  a great idea and peers goes i'll wear my brother's uniform when i do it oh wow i mean it is the sickest  crap i gotta see this clip chicken neck thug cowards who want my gun so they can come shove a gun down  my throat where i'm defenseless like in nazi germany and i want to tell that little little horror  daughter of huntsman that little that little tyrant who wants me dead and who thinks all this is funny 
[02:35:30]  and i want to tell that punk sports writer i want to tell pierce morgan i don't need a gun to defend  myself you ever lay a hand on me i'm going to punch you with an uppercut so hard it's going to rip your  nose off your face wow you're here first folks alex remember the media is going to take that out of  context guys of course they're saying kill me i'm saying i'll defend myself and that's going to be  wrong no that'll be you being aggressive and you shouldn't have your guns well uh alex what's the  recourse for gun owners and people that want to retain their rights in this country uh against these 
[02:36:00]  people that are obviously uh using the media the media itself is is in on it what's our recourse  our recourse is to get really aggressive with these people they want us to be calm they want us to listen  to the simpering npr voice about everything's okay everything's happy it's the same way you go pick  up an old horse when you're taken to the glue factory talk to it real soft real sweet it's the  same way somebody picks up a little kid they want to go torture and kill they're like come here i 
[02:36:30]  got the candy let's be friendly oh no nothing's threatening that's their attitude they want to  keep the debate down at that level while they sit there and imply that all gun owners collectively  share a responsibility in the death of these children right right yeah it's absolutely outrageous  how dare you in fact i meant to get to that point but i never got to it how dare you try to  collectively pierce morgan mr snot nose put all of the tragedies in this world on somebody like me 
[02:37:00]  who has no criminal record none right frankly i like guns when i've kind of moved on from them  they're mainly just sitting there in huge gun safes you know they're acting like i'm sitting there  oiling my guns at 4 a.m you know like there's some kind of idol or something no it's simply the mark  of a free man who's ready to defend his family so it's time for us to let them know listen stop playing  in this game where you go it's just reasonable we don't want your guns you got bills introduced  that are the leading bills to physically take my guns for no reason okay that is a declaration 
[02:37:30]  of war against us and that's all i've told him is i put him on notice i said listen you red coat  usurper if you love guns being taken so much go back to england where they have three times the  violent crime rate because england has no gun murders and i said i know they beat your brains out  with a club or stab you with a knife it's much more dangerous most of your country burned last  year he goes no it didn't you're a lie he said the london riots didn't happen that's how dumb he  thinks his audience is well then he kept just checking you with uh well how many gun deaths 
[02:38:00]  how many gun deaths it's like no well they took away the guns it's a much smaller country it's easier  to confiscate the people's guns and they're a bunch of pussies over there who just gave up their  fucking guns anyway we're not going to do that here let's be honest i mean england  was the most violent out of control place for about a thousand years since the romans pulled  out and then they came in with social conditioning to make it trendy to be passive because that was  how they finally using style subdued the barbarous uh uh uh kelps and and and the gaelic you know 
[02:38:30]  folks that lived in that area so that's imperial brainwashing conditioning but yes when everybody had  guns in england 20 30 years ago and they phased them out over that period they had the lowest crime  rate not just in their area in the uk but in europe now they have the highest crime rate anybody just  type in england has highest crime rate so so they were a very non-violent passive gentlemanly group  and now that they've taken the guns their crime rate has exploded let's be honest about americans 
[02:39:00]  whiskey and guns and freebooting and kicking butt right absolutely being wild is what built this country  and it's why we've been so badass so we need to rediscover that and get rid of the nanny state  and re-energize and become americans again black white old young doesn't matter it's time for us and  they're scared of the gun culture because it's the heart of the only thing left  they're trying to get rid of men yeah they're trying to get rid of fast cars yes get rid of 
[02:39:30]  everything decent and the gun is literally a beachhead for us to rediscover our independence  and to be empowered and the nanny state tyrants hate it exactly alex what about the mental health  checks and stuff for guns it's absolutely ridiculous if i agree if a psychiatrist listen  they always act like none of this is there if a psychiatrist if a psychologist and i think this  is too easy simply files a report when you go in to see them with the mental health institutes under 
[02:40:00]  the cdc you can never buy a gun again and they're probably going to come to your house and confiscate  all your guns adam lanza the reported shooter at sandy hook didn't try to buy guns that month before  once not twice not three times not four times five times he tried to buy those guns and then finally  stole them from mommy i mean if i had a son bouncing off the walls on a bunch of different drugs  i sure as hell wouldn't have the ar-15s out laying absolutely yeah mommy was kind of worthless yes 
[02:40:30]  didn't deny all that we can't but we can't count on mommy and daddy to do the proper thing  more so than me being responsible like they were and every nra member and every gun owner being  responsible uh she's a lot more responsible as our other parents that are in denial in a perfect  world she shouldn't have her her guns obviously laying around like that but but you're gonna have  that exactly he listen they have the fourth most restrictive gun laws in the country in the great  state of connecticut and he got the guns illegally now how did homes get the guns he had a close to 
[02:41:00]  thirty thousand dollar federal government grant in neuroscience and and and so obama said hey if  you got a small business you didn't build that well i guess in a way it's true obama really did  build uh this guy and allow him to attack and his psychiatrist had a folder and even knew he was  reportedly planning all this but magically nothing was done to stop it so i just want to tell you guys  right now you have not done your radio show the last you know you know decades or whatever you're not 
[02:41:30]  doing the show right now the government the state did it right so i just think we should all recognize  the fact that you know i mean when i get on the toilet today uh to drop a deuce i didn't do that no  that's not you that's not you the government does that uh i'm i'm really tired of them uh uh butting  in um in in all of our right trying to take our rights away uh under this obama administration it's  it looks like it's not happening to people that don't want to see it but we're getting so many of 
[02:42:00]  our rights taken away and uh the people are blind to it blind well no that's it it's like well the ndaa  will actually be used on right partiers conservatives libertarians you know homeland  security it's not set up for al-qaeda anymore uh it's for you and uh you know what yeah the nsa  is listed too without warrants and you know what in in you know 15 states they've got federally  funded checkpoints gang checkpoints on highways we're going to search your car without a warrant 
[02:42:30]  yeah shut the highway down and by the way we're going to pass all the obama said i'm not going to  raise the taxes above 250 000 a year and then 77 of americans got a massive pay everyone looked at  their check and freaked out they're like wait a minute uh because again the the the people that  are uninformed and ignorant of what's going on are the first ones to start arguing with you about a  subject they know nothing about if they would have looked into it they'd have seen that their  everybody's taxes were going up exactly and i'm not saying that romney was good either he's bought 
[02:43:00]  and paying out exactly interest and it's so frustrating when i'm telling one of these so-called  liberals thomas jefferson was a liberal he said let people do what they want in their own personal  lives let people keep their money let people own guns you know let's empower the general population  that's a liberal these modern people saying turn my guns in you know that that the french model of  80 plus percent tax is the way to go where they put a 75 tax on everything above what you make at an 
[02:43:30]  80 tax rate i mean so so so 97 has to go to these people these are leech authoritarians who literally  now have the nerve to tell us we didn't build our businesses we didn't paint a well painting we didn't  write a book we didn't make a comedy record a comedy cd we didn't do jack squat no a bunch of  pinheaded bureaucrats are now so arrogant they're telling us that they run our lives these people 
[02:44:00]  are the authoritarians and i am sick and tired of them and now they want our guns because they're going  to collapse our society if they have their way if we stand our ground they will back off but under  agenda 21 you can read their own documents yeah under this globalist plan they want to implode the  economy to make us poor and make us dependent on them that's why food stamps in four years have  gone from 25 million to 49 million almost doubling and they're set to double again in the next four  years america with 100 million people on electronic soup lines exactly and people don't see that as a 
[02:44:30]  bad thing they see that as well liberals anyway see that as something good we're helping people  we're helping everyone what we're doing is destroying the ambition and and uh uh everything  that made this country great over the years uh is being undermined and taken away they put us down in  a pit and they're saying rub the lotion on your skin we're like no let us out and they're like no we  care about your skin rub the lotion on your skin so should we start the revolution now or oh man a 
[02:45:00]  couple more years listen i don't want who's going to fire the first shot right sure when i say  if they try to come for the gun 1776 will commence that is a fact because if you got 150 160 million  gun owners let's say one percent refuse to turn their guns in that's 1.5 million people they want  to have the revolution i don't want to have the revolution physically i want to have it in the  information war because we're actually starting to win that with the general public all the statistics 
[02:45:30]  show that people are getting more and more liberty-minded even if people are having to live  off government assistance the new study is showing they don't like it and they know they've been made  dependent with our jobs being shipped overseas with with 21 billion dollars being spent to ship general  motors to china uh yeah it's it's it's ridiculous and and the mainstream media is are the ones that are  really pushing in the other direction i think the underground internet um of course uh info wars 
[02:46:00]  uh those type of sites are the where you're getting that information out that is being countered  by the mainstream media uh it's it's quite a battle though but but look you guys know the parable of the  emperor's new clothes where really he's been conned by con artists he's butt naked marching in front of  everybody at the uh parade and then a three-year-old steps forward and says look the emperor  yeah laughing it's in trouble i've been to that cnn centers i'm sure you guys have been there many  times i'm just guessing yeah well that's big buildings there in new york i'm on red eye tonight 
[02:46:30]  by the way thank you and and when i'm over there yeah i mean i was over there 10 years ago i was over  there five years ago i was over there three years ago it looked nice there was literally  filth all over the bathrooms filth on the carpet i thought they put me in this thing on purpose so i  walked through the dressing rooms into the other green rooms where the kennedys were at and turned  in there and it was just as dirty and then i was watching wolf blitzer last night on situation room 
[02:47:00]  and there was filth and dirt and black spots all over the big white floor with the stars on it  that place is absolutely rotting listen here's morgan is their top show yeah it has 500  556 000 viewers last year on his top show guys you have millions i mean i don't know your numbers  but i mean how many millions of listeners do you have i think about 10 quite a few okay okay now you're  there you're not arrogant you're not wearing big suits at least now but you're not hopefully sitting 
[02:47:30]  there like your royalty okay no maybe five nope but listen these guys this guy has a half hopefully  two million viewers on a good day and we go to them like they're moses on the mountain right it's  total fraud cnn had like 10 million viewers back in the mid-1990s well that's because they yeah that's  because they push agendas like these stupid mental health checks for gun owners and and and and gun  buyers and all these other things that nobody wants to hear so people tune them out you know what i think 
[02:48:00]  i think the alternative real media even though we're all diverse and have different ideas on everything  i think we ought to have a week coming up in like a couple months where all the real media  where we wear royal crowns and gold outfits and sit on thrones and then have people dress up like  pierce morgan and others that come in and you know fan us and things like it while we show statistics on  the screen of how we've got much bigger audiences than them because if you do that you want to destroy  them you point out that they are paper tigers and frauds that's the last domino to fall i'm telling 
[02:48:30]  you that cnn center alex yeah it's terrible hold on alex what's a paper tiger i've always wanted to  know that well okay okay a real bingo tiger you know we're weighing thousands of pounds will will  will literally rip your head off in seconds as you know a paper tiger yes uh weighs about a pound  and it's painted paper mache and it looks scary if you're 100 yards from it it was sitting in the  jungle but it actually can't do anything but it's nothing a facade uh all talk exactly rotten barn 
[02:49:00]  full of termites that when a big wind comes by is going to blow over with an english accent  i have it off that's why our turkey bit didn't work by the way we used paper turkeys  i have an unrelated question yes you might know the answer to this whatever happened to jesse's  lawsuit with the with the uh navy seal who said that he knocked him out is that still pending or has  that been settled or do you know well i just want to be clear i don't want to get too much into it  because remember i told you guys he was going to sue him i didn't make that up yeah uh i mean i know jesse i've 
[02:49:30]  been around him with military and stuff yeah i mean he would have had to been an evil clone to do  that that's why i knew when i told him he's like alex don't call me in mexico with this and i'm like  he's like alex come on this is a really nasty joke wait and i'm like no listen he goes well you've  never bs me before and i said man i'm not kidding he says he's like what and i mean why would you why  would he go speak at a commencement and then run around look jesse's had people claim that he dances  around on tables drunk the guy hasn't had alcohol like 15 16 years the point is is that it's not 
[02:50:00]  true and i believe jesse but is there a lawsuit that's all we've heard both sides of the story  over and over again i'm just wondering if it's still a case yeah yeah i know i'm long-winded i apologize  that's okay no let me just say what's happened with the lawsuit just google jesse ventura sure  quick news okay it's gone to court the judges refuse to throw it out okay like kyle's wanted uh they're  now going for you know the extreme uh damages because uh kyle has no witnesses he has people 
[02:50:30]  he told about it later and jesse has just all the witnesses the honor of the place everybody that was  there but kyle knows that he's either he's got to push this all the way uh i mean you can go read  their filing uh it's pretty amazing now now his lawyer is implying well maybe it was somebody who looked  like jesse and he was wrong the problem is jesse was there and the fight didn't happen and it would  have been all over the news and and kyle kyle in his own book repeatedly talks about how uh he's lied 
[02:51:00]  to people right okay so that's why the judge saw that and uh i'm just telling you right now jesse is uh  going ahead with the lawsuit and and and he may leave the united states forever basically okay so hold  on if he doesn't win because he says this country cannot be trusted and you can say what you want  about jesse ventura the point is is that he's been wronged in this area all right yeah so it's  basically they tried chris kyle went for probably a motion to dismiss and the judge said no there is 
[02:51:30]  some evidence to proceed here with with what jesse is saying okay i honestly just didn't know we're  running out of uh time with uh real alex jones on twitter um i got the clip from info wars piers  morgan from last night because you you referenced it a couple let me let me hear this it's a quick  clip let me hear this uh clip the most horrifying aspect is what happens after these outrages  is that the nra and the others get on television spread all the fear wayne lapierre and alex jones  and others and then the americans rush out and buy ever more of these weapons and ever more of this 
[02:52:00]  ammunition and so it goes on and the only solution is apparently to arm everybody else  i mean i agree with you i mean didn't i think the purchase of guns went up after sandy hook look  it it is pathetic it is it is ridiculous that you are allowed i don't care what the justification  is that you are allowed in this country to own a semi-automatic weapon much less a hang-up but what  do you need a semi-automatic weapon for the only reason i think you need it is pierce challenge alex 
[02:52:30]  jones to a boxing match show up with a semi-automatic that you got legally and pop them i'd love to see  that in uniform wow just laughing along about shooting you and then pierce said well i would  use my brother's uniform i think that wasn't part of the clip there wow yeah i would be uh are you a  little nervous there alex well it's clear that when they're earlier in the show going oh gee i hope  nothing happens to his kids okay and this is like in a goodfellas movie or something they're like 
[02:53:00]  you better turn over the restaurant hope nothing happens to your kids uh like hope nothing happens  to the kids you know it's interesting i wonder if i wonder if esp if uh if uh cnn will apologize for  those comments oh espn apologize for brent musburger praising an attractive woman i wonder if cnn  will apologize for the hosts allowing joking about shooting a former guest i didn't think that guy  saying she was attractive was anything wrong exactly that's what i'm saying it was just a guy 
[02:53:30]  appreciating an attractive girl but apparently that's not allowed in this country and that's  the world she lives in by the way she makes her living off being attractive she makes money off that  if you were a liberal and that was on fox and they were joking about shooting you oh that would be  fucking news everywhere people would be talking about the host being fired but because you take a pro  gun stands and and peers takes the uh company line uh it's perfectly acceptable for them to joe and 
[02:54:00]  then the woman who's usually the one who goes whoa goes yeah that i'd like to see yeah yeah it's like  i'll wear my brother's uniform and it's obviously a little moment between them well they enjoy it  his brother's the gimp from pulp fiction by the way they enjoyed it alex we've run out of time we got  we got thanks so much man for the call we got a very important guest standing by  keep the fight going alex stay safe my brother all the statistics are up at infowars.com take  care gentlemen take it easy man alex jones i enjoyed alex very much i can't wait till we hate him

[03:21:00]  wants to speak directly with him  call 866-969-1969  the phone lines are open and the jim norton show starts now  good morning slash afternoon depending on when you're listening to this or it could be evening  the uh jim norton show going strong on a wednesday we always start off with an email just to get the 
[03:21:30]  phone lines ringing which they're ringing already but i have a very important um question here from  very short email from oliva and she writes i have this weird lump between my neck and shoulder for  the longest time it hasn't hurt moved or done anything lately it's starting to feel tender do i  ignore it longer or get it hacked off and then she writes thank you dr steve so basically you have a tender  lump and honestly i think you should just leave it there um you know hopefully it'll get really big 
[03:22:00]  and then you could just be very funny at parties pointing out your lump and people will do jokes  about it or uh you know for i kind of think lumps are overrated and uh they never turn out to be  anything bad you know it's like i was dating a girl and she found lumps in both of her breasts and  you know and all of a sudden she's bugging me oh i need to go to the doctor can i borrow some money  i'm like no you know it's like god wants you to have lumps so just have lumps for pete's sake be  beautiful with who you are and um you know i think lump is a great word that's a great insult to call 
[03:22:30]  somebody hey you fucking lump shut up you lump it's never good to be called a lump what do you think of  him he's a lump so uh that's what i would suggest just leave it there i'm sure it'll go away in time if  it's getting tender or sore that probably means it's getting ready to go away so i would just  leave that old lump it ain't gonna hurt you all right who do we got on the phones eric 
[03:23:00]  hey jim uh eric wants to talk to you about sex addiction oh that's eric that's you  eric is addicted to sex different eric a different eric okay yes eric how are you  jimmy first let me say i find you i think you're brilliant man i've been listening to years and  it's you're it's hilarious you're brilliant oh thank you my friend you're very nice uh listen  i was talking about sex addiction i think like you um obviously i've got the i've got an addictive  personality uh while i didn't have alcohol abuse my my family has um i found my addiction is in 
[03:23:30]  porn and it's affected you know i'm 24 hours i shouldn't say 24 hours but i spend all my time on  porn and like you i do the whole edging thing uh i found i spend money on prostitutes whether  it affected my i went through a divorce uh it affects my job just everything and i wondered on  your end you know from somebody that seems so down to earth with regards to his addiction  how come it's something you haven't addressed i know i need to because uh like i said it's just 
[03:24:00]  affected everything with me and uh there's you know i don't have any restraint i know i shouldn't  be doing it uh when i first started with like you know the prostitutes back in the day it was oh just  a little bit let me jerk off then it worked a little more and a little more and it and you  keep mentioning every now and then on the show you that need to do a little bit more and i wondered on  your end how come you've not done anything with it and then what could you or i do well i would suggest  you know it's funny um but what it's like especially with porn in in my lifetime i used to go to the 
[03:24:30]  to back to uh this hotel and they would get a wee a playboy in a penthouse and i took a screwdriver  and i would jimmy the magazines out at the beginning of the month i would go and steal pornography  and then again i would then eventually we got a vcr and i would rent pornos or i would go to my  friend's house and watch a porno but it was it was few and far between and then as time goes on  technology gives you more and more ways to do it so now you can act out literally while you're in 
[03:25:00]  the car on your way to work by just looking at your phone you can get porn on your phone you can  dirty text you can there's so many ways to get it so the the need to keep it going gets more and  more intense and it's like a dopamine drip it's like it's or a morphine drip you know just jerking  off and edging and not coming is just your way of staying high and zoned out and i actually have  started addressing it recently to answer your question um and i'm kind of in a withdrawal phase  now it's really hard uh it's uh but the reason i haven't is because sex is a very hard one it still 
[03:25:30]  feels really good i still part of me still likes the addiction and knowledge is no defense because  i know something is bad um it's nice to know it but i have to be ready to give it up it has to  you have to hit bottom with it just knowing it's bad is not enough and that's why i wondered what is  you know with sex addiction it's different than and again i guess spending my money and all that kind  of shit where you sit there and go hey when's bottom i don't have a i don't have your kind of 
[03:26:00]  uh income my friend but uh you know when is bottom and then what kind of help you know i've gone to my  therapist in the past and yeah well we went around and i told them it always kind of got back into my  mental state and all that stuff but i wonder on your end how is it that you've begun is there  uh you know obviously there's i guess sex addiction well there are to answer your question there's uh  there's 12-step programs you can look up uh therapy is one way 12-step programs there are  plenty of ways to get help for it if you want it especially again the the same thing that helps 
[03:26:30]  you jerk off 24 hours a day is the same thing that helps you find help for it it's google and the  computer so if you want to find help for it there are 12-step programs and meetings you can go to  um but thank you for the call man and uh good luck brother take care good luck and i appreciate  oh sorry to cut you off that was your but thank you for the call um brother who's next brother um  we're going to talk to elizabeth in the midwest oh she has a twitter addiction oh hello elizabeth yes  i kind of understand that checking the twitter uh so you're on twitter is your addiction checking your 
[03:27:00]  own at mentions or other people's or what is it uh well i'm just on there all the time i can't  control myself this is really getting out of hand what is he what is it do you like about  it what does it do for you i don't know that's what i need to find out i guess well do you twitter  a lot or do you are you always commenting are you always well you know i really don't have anything  witty or profound to say i just need to be there well are you what i'm saying is are you commenting 
[03:27:30]  at all or just reading what other people say i do comment and i retweet and you know i do the  star thing and i recently found out about that you know star effing deal and that made me terribly  uncomfortable because now i can't star anything without feeling all weird about it what's that  mean star everything star what do you mean starring everything you know that star effing thing you know  star fucking i don't know what you mean oh god that's it that's it i wasn't gonna say it but yeah 
[03:28:00]  i don't like it well then what obviously you just like to to have the dialogue and you like to  communicate with a bunch of people yes i do well that's what it is do you have a lot of friends  well yeah but you know they bore me compared to these people on twitter yeah you just got to get  kind of caught out there in the as they say the cyber world it's a hard one to to to get out of  because it's a very recent thing that we've had access to like how how often have we had this for  how long have we had this ability like i always hate when people go oh i hate when people are always 
[03:28:30]  looking at their cell phones it's like on your cell phone now with a smartphone you have access  to everything and and rarely are you talking to somebody who is as interesting as everything else  combined so no matter what we're talking about i can look up anything else on the phone and it's hard  to not do that i don't have that kind of phone though i have to sit in front of a laptop oh yeah well  okay whatever you know the laptop is the same thing as the phone i was just using the phone as an 
[03:29:00]  example oh i understand computers the same thing obviously it's the internet oh yeah so i don't  know try to give yourself a little time away from it i don't know what to tell you because uh it's  very difficult to stay away from it yes it is so uh maybe do other things maybe um i would suggest  masturbating with a cucumber is a healthy way no i can't do that look i'm a retired crack whore i don't  want to go back to all that oh you used to oh okay so you used to do a lot of drugs uh are you sober  well yeah of course okay so they switched addiction that's all you should have said that at the 
[03:29:30]  beginning that's all you switched addiction i wasn't on the stuff well all right no i'm all right  never mind i'm fine now i'm born again i'm fine oh cool you must be fun to follow on twitter all  right well it was nice talking to you good luck to you i would just suggest uh you know find other  activities what i'm going to tell you okay bye rub your clip with the shoe from monopoly set  uh this is uh john in alabama he saw jango and shane and got into an altercation with the youth oh  okay john hi john hey hey jim how are you buddy good buddy how are you i'm doing all right good to 
[03:30:00]  talk to you thank you i have a question on what crime fighting jimmy norton would have done in my  situation on christmas day you know opening day for jango i go with my nephew i'm 40 he's 27 we're both  pretty big guys and we go to the movie theater and we're waiting on a friend of his to show up  who's just a few minutes late all of a sudden this uh youth comes in with his girl and uh he starts  getting pissed off because there's an empty seat beside him he my nephew and i are sitting side by 
[03:30:30]  side so when he starts raising hell and fussing i tell my nephew to sit in my seat and then i go  sit on the other end which means there's an empty seat between us because i knew he was about to try  to get our seats so he sits down in an empty seat beside me and starts really harassing me telling  me things like we don't own the theater we have no right to save the seat starts touching me on the  face and i told him don't you ever touch me again right and then whenever he touches me again i go to 
[03:31:00]  stand up and about four maybe five people or so behind us grab me when i go to get up anyway the whole  time i'm sitting there they don't say anything to this guy while he's harassing me because they are  the same race as this youth okay so you're a white guy in the theater a black kid is saying something  to you talking shit and of course a bunch of black people don't tell them to be quiet because you're  a white guy exactly and they don't say anything at all until i go to stand up but um the whole time 
[03:31:30]  i'm sitting there well let me ask you a question how old were they because they might have been scared  of them too you know like you know black older black people are scared of young black guys that  could be armed too it looked to me of course i'm just assuming it looked to me like it was an older  black couple with their two sons and maybe a girl that was either with them or just sitting beside  them but i felt that the three uh male hands were the one the three sets of male hands were the ones  that grabbed me i could tell do you think that this kid would have got his ass kicked or you guys were  going to he was going to kick your ass no it wasn't going to happen because after all of the 
[03:32:00]  bullshit that's going on in theaters lately i had a loaded firearm in my pocket i'm licensed to  carry okay and i wasn't about to shoot him of course if he had tried to attack me i would have  pulled it you know but i would have just left but i don't want quentin tarantino reading about that  online and shit like that happened in a theater so the people grabbed you they weren't menacing you  they were just trying to break it up yeah but my only point was they didn't say anything the whole  time this guy sat down and harassed me for a solid five minutes which doesn't seem like a long  time unless you've got somebody in your ear so you don't shut the fuck up shut the fuck up and 
[03:32:30]  where was his girlfriend sitting uh she was standing up uh right close to the entrance the  weather it's one of those uh cinemas where there's an entrance on each side and we were over on the  left side right near where the little wall terminates where you turn in i don't know what i would have  done it would depend on the energy i was getting from this guy and if i thought he might be a drunk or a  real problem it's hard to say what i would do because again this is how this is how people get  shot like this dumb motherfucker didn't know that he was talking shit to a guy with a pistol in his 
[03:33:00]  pocket and let's just say you had stood up and no one had stopped you and that kid pulled out a knife  he would have gotten himself shot like i don't know what i would have done because i understand this is  one goes to two goes to three and maybe those people stopping you is because they saw this was  now about to escalate maybe you standing up was the sign of them escalating and they they sometimes  black people understand black people better than white people do and they may have seen this guy and 
[03:33:30]  no he's just talking shit he's not going to do a fucking thing this guy's trying to impress his chick  he's not going to do a fucking thing physically but when you stood up they understood this was about  to get really bad i mean i don't know i'm just i could be totally wrong too and it was my problem  for not describing it earlier i tried to even reason with the guy when he first sat down i said  look i would be mad if i showed up with my girl and we couldn't sit together because all the seats are  taken but i said that my party is not responsible for that and the last thing he wanted to listen to 
[03:34:00]  was logic did you say somebody is here with me and they're just in the bathroom that's what i told  him the guy wasn't in the bathroom yet no i know but you don't say that you say the guy's in the  bathroom that's exactly what i said i said yeah he's with us but he's in the bathroom and i'll  try to wrap it up really quickly it takes so long uh he goes and gets the usher and luckily during  that time our friend does show up and he sits in the seat so he comes back but we still got a bag  of popcorn sitting there as he walks by he just grabs the bag of popcorn and throws it right across  the middle of the floor in the theater in front of everybody so i got my revenge i got to yell out 
[03:34:30]  right in front of his girl that that guy is just a piece of shit and everybody in the theater left so i felt  better but it still pissed me off and really took me out of the movie so i had to go see it again  but it was great yeah well i'm sure you could have just you could have just watched it and  every time certain words were dropped you should have just went all right man well hey look you  didn't have to shoot anybody he didn't get shot so it worked out okay that's how all altercations  should end with some punk cocksucker throwing your popcorn him and his dumb chick being thrown out 
[03:35:00]  yeah thanks a lot love the show jim thanks buddy be good  let's go you should have went to see the billy crystal movie that's what you should have done  not a lot of violence there go on iraq who's next let's talk to dave in ohio all right hi dave  davey hi hi how's it going jim good buddy how are you pretty good uh see i i have a little bit  issues uh uh i have a best friend of mine is uh is dating my cousin and she's been dating him for 
[03:35:30]  about five years now and uh about three years ago i uh i hooked up with her a couple of times your  cousin is she your first cousin or distant no no my cousin's girlfriend oh i'm sorry cousin's girlfriend  you hooked up with her while they were dating yeah okay and uh it was a few years ago but you know we  never talk about her or anything and uh i uh recently she's having troubles with him and dating him 
[03:36:00]  and everything and i'm i don't know if she's giving off like the vibe that she wants to date me or not  and i don't know if my attraction to her is like me wanting these negative things because i'm not gonna  lie i'm a little bit of piece of well hold on are you and your cousin close i mean we used to be we  we we grew up really close that's how i met her so basically you just did you like the high of just  fucking his girlfriend you like the high of doing something that taboo i don't know it might be it 
[03:36:30]  of course i uh i mean i i'm i'm a little i like girls that are a little messed up sometimes i i'm not  from my age i have a long list of things i like and as opposed to more just another stuff well i i think my  here's my advice brother leave it alone first of all it's a shitty thing to do and it's easy for me  to go out shitty but it really is shitty she's obviously a cunt if she's fooling around with 
[03:37:00]  her boyfriend's cousin like that's dirty um and you shouldn't be doing anything if you hooked up one  time i think that you should just go all right we fucked up and leave it alone you don't want to  start a thing with your girl your cousin's girlfriend that's just shitty yeah yeah and i mean i'm still  friends with her and and i haven't i haven't made any advances in years with her enough and  i just i'm just trying to keep it friendly but i don't know if that's what she's going after or what  well you the reason the fact that you're still friends with her you like the fact that there's 
[03:37:30]  a push and pull between you you like the secret that you two have when he's in the room i bet he  gets up to go to the bathroom once in a while and you two will look at each other real quick  or you'll say certain things and she'll look at you a certain way there's a whole under  fucking underlying thing that happens with you two while he's there that he doesn't even know  about yeah and i understand that high but it's it's kind of a dirty thing to do um you know you're  going to do what you're going to do i'm not going to be able to convince you either way but that would  be my advice would be to leave it alone because it's kind of shitty all right thank you jim sure 
[03:38:00]  you're welcome buddy i mean a lot of things are shitty i mean i'm an oral sex fanatic and sometimes  that's shitty for obvious reasons and women feel the same way um yeah there's this thing called  mask and it masks it's mask sexual flavors and it's basically the new way to foreplay it's a  revolutionary intimacy enhancement product which has been designed to help couples enrich their sex life  and their relationship because a lot of times girls don't want to go down on you know how it is

[03:42:00]  requested me and i'm like i didn't realize that it was actually you yeah i didn't have a facebook  page for a long time and then i reactivated it and uh i don't think i'm going to keep it though  i have no reason to have it there you don't think it's a good way just to keep keep in touch  with high school friends and chums that you haven't seen in a while yeah that's like saying  it's a good way to kill yourself i mean i have no need to do that i don't want it i don't want to  know any of those people anymore were you an outcast in high school or were you a guy who was like 
[03:42:30]  loved in class clown or were you kind of an ostracized guy i have a handful of friends but it was a  huge high school like you really had to be you know you had to really think to not have a couple  of friends okay so basically it was it was the odds are that you know unless you're a complete zilch  you're going to have somebody who likes you just because of the numbers yeah somebody will try you  out at least for a few months and then and then they're not friends with you and then you see them  in the hall and you kind of wave like a girl you fucked one yeah the we used to be friends but we're 
[03:43:00]  not talking anymore for no reason other than we're both just not interested type of way yeah  oh it's so sad so are you now do you do you not want to see them because you're annoyed at them  or do you just have no interest because they didn't interest you then i'm just being vaguely  negative i don't know i guess for me it's like it's an all-or-none thing like there are a few people  from high school that i'd like to be in touch with and then there's a whole bunch that i really don't  want to be in touch with just because you know i mean 90 of anybody is awful you know do you find they 
[03:43:30]  enhance what your relationship was like in school because of who you are and where you are now like  dude you remember me we used to and you're like no i said hello to you twice yes i've had a few  yes i've had a few people who've been like oh man those were amazing times i'm like well  the imaginary ones were yeah i didn't share any amazing times with you i'll usually just kind of  wish aids on them and then uh you know i think that's the best way to handle it you just wish  aids on them and you give them a wink like i was just kidding even though you weren't well you know 
[03:44:00]  it's funny jim norton is that uh it's not even like some of the popular kids from high school that  wouldn't have talked to me have pretended we had fun times like you think it would be like the kids  who had no friends but they're all doing fine now well the popular kids a lot of times i think peaked  in high school like when you see those guys who are 40 and still wearing their varsity jacket and  still telling those dumb stories it's like that was your fucking that was the high for you and 
[03:44:30]  where guys like yourself and me we we didn't peak until we were fucking 35 and begin not becoming  zeros isn't this better though isn't it way better to peak later in life than uh in in those years  which you kind of kind of forgotten high school i don't remember a lot of it yeah i i be my most of  my fond memories are not centered around high school at all and yeah you're right it's much better to peak  now um when you know what to do with it i mean back then you banged one or two chicks but now it's  like it's so much greater to go out and fuck girls that are still high school age and here i am 44 and 
[03:45:00]  you know fucking 20 year olds yeah exactly you're you're you're well if it's a 20 year old it's a  really dumb girl in high school i know let's be honest i padded that a few years but i padded five  years onto that just so i don't get in trouble enough but no if you peak in high school you're good for  three years and uh then then you have to ride out like fucking 50 years of misery or 60 yeah because 
[03:45:30]  you know if you peak at 35 it's going to be a longer you're going to be i mean you  you started peaking in your 30s and you're still there yeah i mean i i feel like there's still hope  for more to happen um i don't feel like i'm on the down slide yet where it is a high school zenith  the rest of your life is trying to capture some glory that equals what you had when you were 18  which is just it's i feel almost depressed for those guys when i see them now how how their lives  are and how they can't wait for the reunion and it's like oh fuck i have zero interest in that 
[03:46:00]  well you know it used to be a very much shorter life expectancy for human beings right so 18 used to  actually kind of be your peak of your life and then you know you get in your 20s you start getting you  know syphilis and uh and uh and bubonic plague and dying so right so people really you know and  kings and queens and like big those people were all in their in their 20s late teens you know uh back  in history right so now we're we're inventing we're like we are inventing how to live this this long 
[03:46:30]  and uh you know to have any kind of life but anyway i'm sorry i'm boring right now no you're not  it's it's actually it's it's interesting because uh it's not boring at all because the high school  peak years is something that a lot of people who are listening have either dealt with or they didn't  peak in high school and it's like they feel like pieces of shit because they're 25 and they haven't  done anything and that just means you got something left to do and as long as you're not doing drugs or  just being a complete cunt you have plenty of good things ahead of you oh yeah that's what you and i do 
[03:47:00]  we take negative and we make a positive out of it lou we take lemons and we make lemonade  we take lemons we make lemonade we drink it and then we piss on the face of some uh  yeah of someone who's not peaking high school we just yearnate on them and degrade them for being  the zeros that we were exactly where are you down brother where are you i'm just in traffic on the 
[03:47:30]  west side highway i'm on my way home oh okay you're you're going back out on the road oh are you  doing oh fucking oh two in london you're doing the arena yes i am i'm doing the oh two in london  congratulations man that's an amazing feat that's it that's in a real arena show that's a big arena  show yeah i don't usually like playing big rooms but uh uh i don't want to spend a long time in london  and i want to i i have you know i want to play for a lot of people so i'm just getting it done now are  you going to do arenas when you come back here is that are you kind of testing the waters on that to 
[03:48:00]  see how much you like it i don't know man because i like the rooms i'm playing in on  this tour are all like you know most of them are about 2500 seats right and to me that's plenty  i mean i could have played madison square garden this year but i i i wanted to sell tickets myself  right and uh msg uses ticket masters so you're kind of you can't you don't have a choice there  so i played the city center and i did like 12 shows yes like two at the garden but to me when you go to  see a comedian you don't want to go up a big concrete ramp and have a big fucking cup with 
[03:48:30]  carmelo anthony on it you know and you're watching them on a jumbo trot next to a guy  wearing a ranger's jacket it's not that's not comedy to me right then it feels like hey we're at this  event and we're enjoying this event but it does not have the intimacy or the connection of just a  stand-up on stage in front of you that's what i think so it's just a way for stand-ups to make a  lot of money all at once uh but chris rock played o2 and he told me it was really great and that it can be 
[03:49:00]  intimate and feel like a real soul because o2 is more like that's european arena so that's like  12 000 right you know msg is like 20 or something like that so well it's nice to know that you could  do it and you're choosing the other way it's not like you couldn't do it and you're just choosing  i'd rather do uh six shows than one show just because they're going to be better shows  yeah i don't mind doing more shows and uh i'd rather have the shows go well  and the amount of i'm i actually make more doing the more shows than msg so uh and then 
[03:49:30]  the uh the fans pay less and uh more fun it's so great that you did that dude you really i mean  honestly you really changed the way people are doing business because uh the networks know now they  can't they don't have the final say in whether or not somebody does especially you really fucking  rolled the dice and and you changed uh the way people think about doing business which is amazing that  you did that well i don't know what it did for anybody else i mean i think that people still  have to you still have to be established to get up to get like it's no it's not a way to break out 
[03:50:00]  right right like selling selling a special online isn't a way to to get noticed to get if you're nobody  or you know lesser known it's hard to get traction right but the reason mine sold is because i've been  doing this for 25 years i have a show on tv and and mostly i think is i sell tickets on the road that's  it follows that trend more than it did uh anything from tv so um but somebody who's just started i 
[03:50:30]  mean they shouldn't have a special anyway no and if you're doing it five or six years you you shouldn't  have a special and you shouldn't have that kind of draw but there's but there's guys with big fan  bases like yourself and you know aziz and gaffigan and a few other guys it just takes a bit of  fucking uh juice away from the networks which is just really really nice um and eventually certain  comedians may start putting younger comedians on their sites which would just be another  fuck you to the network so whatever works but i'm just so happy you did that thanks i saw your 
[03:51:00]  last one uh please be offended and it's really fucking funny oh thank you man thanks yeah hoping  to do another one i'm gonna go why are you gonna do another one just because i want to just do another  special no i know but when oh wait i would like to do it this year i would like to do it in april if i  can i would like to do it without i mean i'm ready to go now but i would rather wait until april so  it's a year yeah good i just want to make those people laugh lou spread a little joy you know what  i mean that's all that we all ever want to do all right buddy take care see you jim bye 
[03:51:30]  i had no idea you rocked it that was louis ck i thought you we thought you would have recognized  the voice no on the phone it's it's weird so i just thought it was a guy named i almost told you to  hang up on because it was like the guy named louis fuck with me great if you did i know and i didn't  know it was him and i had to explain like oh sorry you uh you said you want to do a special hopefully  around april i would love to yeah is there any cities that you're looking at doing it uh i want  to shoot if i could shoot my next special i would rather i want it to be in boston um maybe the wilbur 
[03:52:00]  yeah or uh i think louis shot and i think it was constitution hall he shot one of his specials and  he recommended that to me but there was some weird bureaucracy which is why i didn't do it last time and i  went to uh cleveland to cleveland which i enjoyed oh who's the next call uh the next one is a girl  and i think louis next time should call me for some advice because i fuck it i could help him as much  i could help everybody that is true that's right i have an answer louis if you're listening it rhymes  with mill yourself okay uh this is diane in long island hi diane hi diane honey oh hi how are you 
[03:52:30]  you're adorable thank you it's like brenda vaccaro what's up diane i have a question for you sure  i've been married 15 years this may okay he wants to play with my tiny hole okay it's good  that you're using sexy terminology like that and i never let ever and i want to know is that right  or is he going to find somebody else to cheat on me well i mean look the bottom line is if your 
[03:53:00]  husband after all how many kids do you have none oh none okay i was i was thinking maybe you had a  few kids and your fucking vagina look like horse lips and couldn't feel anything anymore it's not  a meaty one baby okay well maybe look the fact that you're married 15 years and he wants to go  down there and tease your hiney i think you should let him lick it stop being self-conscious what you  do is you take a shower you you you put your foot up on uh the end of the tub you soap out your  asshole with your finger and then you let him go down there and eat it and if he wants to put a 
[03:53:30]  finger in there um if it feels good go with it if you have to shit just go i have to shit i have to  shit i have to shit the other part of it is he won't let me play with his well well that's nice  that you want to why won't he maybe he knows his ass is fucking oniony and horrible what do you think  well i don't know mine should be okay and his should not be all right uh basically what you're  saying is this what's good for the goose is good for the gander exactly and i think you two should uh 
[03:54:00]  should swap little sayings like that while you eat each other's asses in the 69 position  let him do it and then after he does it a couple of times then maybe you try to sneak back there and  give him a little pucker lick you think that'll work yeah i do i think my girl has never been  invaded it's an exit only all right i know but i know but again you stop using dumb expressions like  that like he wants to lick my hiney my girls everybody you know this is not fucking this is not the bob  hope show you can say i want my husband he wants to eat my ass and i've never had that i only  shit out of it okay all right thank you baby godspeed you too bye let's go to las vegas and 
[03:54:30]  talk to frank oh relationship issue a relationship issue oh frank was better what's happening in your  relationship uh frank is uh tony uh is tony trying to fuck her on the dance floor and he's going you're  like a tiger all right sorry scarface go that got what it deserved dead silence there wow he  fucking shot himself tony are you there frank oh frank and he hung up all right he wanted he was 
[03:55:00]  asking he wanted no no no no don't help him he rocked no he wants to hang up after my great  fucking scarface improv all right hey i should shoot the catcher if he hasn't gotten a base hit  all year who's next uh let's go to jeff in indiana he's having a panic attack oh god jeff  don't let's see what are you doing jeff he's got a hood on right now he's in a black neighborhood  panicking talking under his hood on the phone what are you doing i'm laying on a couch okay buddy 
[03:55:30]  why are you panicking uh uh i i'm i'm trying to get to a point in my life where i can confess  i'm not catholic but i am going back home this weekend to my original church because i'm things  are pretty fucked up for me right now okay and uh i'm really scared to uh say all the  shit that i need to say to make things better well what's fucked up with you in a nutshell a brief  synopsis um i should accomplish a lot more than i have um i developed a bit of a drinking problem okay 
[03:56:00]  i am working on making things better okay let me ask you how old are you i am 29 okay so 29 you  have many as as louie and i were just saying there's plenty of years ahead of you um and if  you have a drinking problem there are ways to address that you can go you know there's 12-step  fellowships and programs so this is not a problem that's insurmountable so what is so scary that you 
[03:56:30]  have to say what do you have to say to me it sounds like you need to do something i'm just afraid  of admitting the failure uh i i failed for the first part um i i want to work on making better  i've got some books that i'm reading uh by the way that lewis guy sounds pretty funny um yes he is  but he's a real he's a real twat of a man i know i'm on facebook with him yes but no i i just i'm  terrified of admitting my my own failure well uh you did just admit it so admitting is not the problem 
[03:57:00]  what you're scared of i think is doing something about it because admitting something is easy you  know into a certain degree i mean it's not easy it's the first step but doing something about it  is hard because now you have to accept it and you have to act on it and the way to act on it is to  maybe look up a 12-step program confession is nice but that's only a partial action that's just another  form of admitting it um right i would suggest going to a meeting of some sort um and and begin 
[03:57:30]  thinking about really quitting your drinking that to me is the first thing and nothing will get  accomplished until you do that well i appreciate it thank you all right buddy don't just lay there  and fucking wither on the vine you got a lot of years left all right let's go to sandy in texas  hi sandy hi jimmy um i have a relationship issue i have been been with this guy for eight months 
[03:58:00]  and um we we both love each other immensely but the problem is is we have little communication  there's no trust he's a drunk um who you dating the guy that just called from the couch  no sounds like it though but um but and i've been supporting him for the last eight months  so what's so great let me i'm sorry to interrupt you but he's a drunk now you probably knew that  very early on is your is your father an alcoholic no he was not no your mother either huh no it's 
[03:58:30]  weird that somebody with so you you're knowingly dating an alcoholic for what reason  i've been kind of wondering that myself um because it's never been something that i mean my ex-husband  i was with him for 20 years and he wasn't he was an alcoholic but he was an alcoholic anonymous he  had like over 30 years oh okay so so are you just kind of settling because you were married for 
[03:59:00]  20 years and now you're back in the game and you know you find a guy that maybe is good looking  or treated you nice a little bit so you're kind of settling for something that you shouldn't just  because you're happy he's showing up well that may be i mean because he is he's a good looking guy  you know he he he had treated me great within the last month and then it's kind of like after that  things kind of went sour and we you know if he's mad at me or whatever then he withholds sex and 
[03:59:30]  the sex has been not loving it's just been basically get the job done just you know bend over  fuck me and that's the end of it okay so i'm i'm i'm feeling like i'm being used i feel like i'm a  warm hole and a checkbook okay that's a great singles ad warm hole checkbook seeking friend um  look if you're feeling that way you're probably right so uh i i think the thing to do would be to  end that relationship unless he decides to get sober maybe say look if you if you don't get sober or try 
[04:00:00]  to i'm gonna have to um i'm gonna have to uh as we like to say shuffle off to buffalo and then put  your arms out in the shuffle thing because it'll give him like a visual  well i i don't foresee him ever becoming sober um he's got a lot of physical pain and he can't take  uh medication so he kind of substitutes it with alcohol okay well um he's got an excuse he can quit  drinking he's not drinking just to because it's a medical necessity he's if he's an alcoholic he wants 
[04:00:30]  to continue drinking he's going to continue drinking i would just suggest getting out of it  because you know if it's eight months in you're already saying this what do you think five years  is going to be good it's going to be terrible that's true yeah so all right well how do i do  it without breaking his heart because he's always saying he's how in love with me who cares like  they like i don't mean that to be cold but he doesn't care how you feel when he's withholding sex  or when he's just jamming it in your hole or getting his bills paid all of a sudden you're worried  how about how he's gonna feel hmm good point yeah why doesn't he worry about how you're gonna 
[04:01:00]  feel when he's fucking having you pay his bills or when he's just jamming his pecker into your hot  pocket all right all right well spoken thank you very much jimmy i love you all right thank you good  luck thanks uh let's go to uh line nine this is mike in vegas all right mike in vegas how are you  hey i'm good how are you i like the i like you rock when he says what line it's on because that  really gets people involved in the show well you know yes line nine what's up hi uh essentially i 
[04:01:30]  want to uh have i want to watch my girl fuck another man in front of me welcome to the club  well i can't quite uh get her to do it uh i've tried to talk to her but at one time she was kind  of okay with the idea and then she suddenly pulled back and was like no i'm not okay and i better put  a real stale on the old relationship well let me ask you how long you been with her uh seven years 
[04:02:00]  okay seven years uh have you always had these fantasies about girls or is it just with her  and has it started recently or since the beginning uh yes in the beginning with her i've been watching  you know i mean i wanted to watch it but she's one of those good girls i want to kind of get to see  these kind of things like you know she's a catholic school girl she comes from a well-to-do family  you know she only had one boyfriend like you know real relationship aka me and i'm her first  fuck you don't want to do it oh you're her first fuck now you don't want to do it just to feel bad 
[04:02:30]  about it and sabotage the relationship do you no no no okay maybe you could do something like this  maybe you guys could anonymously put ads on craigslist with like a picture of her body or whatever  and you could put ads out for the kind of guy you'd like to see fucking her and then maybe you  can read the responses you know you get a separate gmail account or whatever anonymously and you two  could fuck while reading these responses and looking at the photos and see how she feels about that and 
[04:03:00]  then maybe talk to a few of them on the phone while you're fucking her um block your number and call  those guys most guys like that i guess would give you the number um you know why don't you ease into it  like that and then maybe bring a guy over and she'll suck his dick in front of you like don't  make her commit to fucking the guy um or say you want a guy just to watch you two fucker ease into  it by slowly bringing another guy in so if all of a sudden she goes i want to back out she's backing 
[04:03:30]  out of of of only a little bit as opposed to having gotten fucked by another guy  i'm pretty smart i guess i tried to go for the whole fucking the whole golden egg instead of just  kind of building my way up yeah just work your way up a little bit it's a big step for her she  doesn't know how she's gonna feel she doesn't know how you're gonna feel and uh have you done that  before yeah well i've you know with different chicks i've watched like an ex-girlfriend yeah like 
[04:04:00]  an ex-girlfriend you know i thought that was cool but you know that relationship only went bad because  there was a whole bunch of drama with family but you know i mean i thought that was great when i  watched i thought that was amazing yeah it can be very hot i mean i would just suggest that though  ease into it do an anonymous singles ad see what kind of guy she likes do more dirty talking about it  and so it's not just your fetish find out what she may want to fuck a black guy she may want to  puerto rican she may want some something she hasn't told you so see how she responds to different photos 
[04:04:30]  videos and um if it does anything for her and maybe you'll get her more invested by doing that  i could try i mean like i said she's uh she's catholic girl all the way catholic school from  kindergarten up to college right give me a rough road speaking of puerto rican i am one  oh okay so maybe she wants to fuck another guy who's working or whatever i'm kidding sir  all right good luck to you hi joe all right thank you jim hi jim joe de rosa just came in we have uh 
[04:05:00]  how much time we've left i think we've got about three minutes okay let's do it we're doing this too  i know i have a read we're doing advice calls i didn't i'm sorry i'm saving lives i just want to say  hi hi who's next to your rock that needs a life saved i'm helping a lot of people here joking so  today on the show we've had louis ck and joe de rosa i would say this has been a good show so far  uh let's talk to pat new jersey he uh feels like a complete failure in life oh hi pat hey jim good  morning how are you buddy welcome to the uh opian anthony uh channel the jim norton show
