<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a self-promotional segment emphasizing its controversial nature, immediately followed by crude banter, including a joke about women with explosives.  The hosts then launched into a discussion of the 2008 presidential election, focusing on Barack Obama's plagiarism accusations and Wisconsin victories, contrasting them with Hillary Clinton's declining media presence. Opie shared a story about cheating on a Russian history paper in college. This transitioned into a comedic, vulgar rendition of a Hillary Clinton campaign song, described as sounding like a "tranny" in parts, followed by further election analysis and listener calls, some expressing dislike for Michelle Obama.  The show then veered into a discussion about the perceived effeminacy of American Idol contestants, using derogatory terms like "twink" repeatedly,  analyzing their perceived homosexuality and discussing evolving gender roles.  They briefly touched on a Gene Simmons sex tape before referencing a comedic bit about "Gay Marco" trading sex for NSYNC tickets.  The show concluded this segment with a news rundown covering a satellite shootdown, a sex offender posing as a teen, "octopus girl," and an Indonesian earthquake.

The next segment primarily focused on the 2008 election, including commentary on Michelle Obama's national pride statement and comparisons to Cindy McCain.  This transitioned to the main topic: unearthed audio recordings of Dave Rabbit, a Vietnam-era underground radio DJ broadcasting from a whorehouse. Numerous clips were played, showcasing Rabbit's irreverent, drug-influenced style, filled with profanity and descriptions of his methods for evading censorship and his popular homemade merchandise.  A recurring segment, "A Message from the Latrine Walls," featured crude graffiti. Captain Ivan Pansy's weather report was also featured.  Lewis Black, a guest comedian, joined the election discussion, offering cynical perspectives.  The hosts expressed their desire to have Dave Rabbit on the show, also mentioning Terry O'Quinn (*Lost*) as a future guest.

The following segment centered on Terry O'Quinn (*Lost*), with Lewis Black still present.  They discussed O'Quinn's career, filming *Lost*, his lack of knowledge about the show's overall plot, and challenges of filming in Hawaii.  The conversation included ribbing Anthony for his apparent celebrity fanboying, an upcoming *Semi-Pro* screening with a corn dog giveaway, *There Will Be Blood* Oscar moments, Louis Blackâ€™s political commentary, and anecdotes about other guests and experiences. Lewis Black detailed a grueling USO tour, including anecdotes about Robin Williams' alleged cocaine use. A preview of Jim Norton's short film "When Penis Met Throaty" was also discussed.

A subsequent segment prominently featured Lewis Black recounting his USO tour with Robin Williams, Kid Rock, and Lance Armstrong, describing the cramped quarters and the personalities of his traveling companions.  More Dave Rabbit tapes were played, featuring explicit language and sexual content.  The hosts speculated about Rabbit's identity. Jamie and Adam from *Mythbusters* called in, discussing their show, future episodes, conspiracy theories (including the JFK assassination), and their own near-misses and injuries during experiments.

The final excerpt featured a phone interview with Jamie and Adam from *Mythbusters*. They discussed their show's methodology, risks involved, debunking myths (including 9/11 and moon landing conspiracy theories), and memorable moments (like a salami-powered rocket). The conversation then turned vulgar, discussing neighbors' reactions, Adam's Charmin commercial, and frequent injuries, transitioning into a graphic discussion about sexual preferences, focusing on amputees and overweight women. The segment included listener calls, references to other radio personalities, a Google Trends segment on "Dave Rabbit," and more listener calls before the show ended.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Two mentally retarded women strapped with remote control explosives  where we use as unwitting suicide bombers.  Run! It is Pete Rose!  This is where entertainment is going.  You're a drunken pig and you're not sexy.  I hope you're killed by a drunk driver that isn't you. 
[00:01:00]  I hope you're killed by a drunk driver letting you sober.  Stay on sick freaks!  What is the biggest piece of s*** you're involved with?  I think that's the way to go with this interview, I'm thinking.  This show.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Wake up. 
[00:01:30]  Wake up.  Morning.  Good morning.  Wake up.  You.  Don't hit that snooze.  That's what I was doing.  Hitting the snooze today. 
[00:02:00]  Hitting the snooze a little bit.  Hitting the snooze.  Just a tad.  I got up early this morning.  You did, did you?  Because my gut was grumbling.  Were you percolating?  Oh, man, was I.  And then for some reason decided to make beef stew at 4.15 in the morning.  That doesn't sound like a healthy breakfast.  Why would you make beef stew?  Oh, my God.  Did it fill the house up with a nice aroma of beef stew? 
[00:02:30]  Boy, did it.  Wow.  That is disgusting.  It was truly beef stew.  Want to say what?  What happened?  It was beef stew.  What happened, Jimmy?  Because you've got to be careful when you're making beef stew that early.  Sometimes you get on the back of your legs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Clumsily you cook it.  Yeah.  Well, it all depends how you dump it out of the can.  All right.  All right.  Well, if you ever see it, it's in a can. 
[00:03:00]  Wow, that was a good one.  There's a little bit of beef stew on the tip of your white shoe.  That was a rough night.  Let's say good morning to the people out there.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hi.  Want to say good morning to all the cheeseheads?  Our phone number is 877-212-ON-A.  If you're a cheesehead and you want to call our show today.  A cheesehead?  Just proving that Obama's got this nomination. 
[00:03:30]  How is he winning Wisconsin?  Well, I've had...  How is he winning Wisconsin?  He's winning.  Yeah.  He's going to be the nomination.  The guy's...  Yeah.  He's definitely on line to be the Democratic nominee.  He was accused of plagiarism.  It didn't even slow him down a bit.  Didn't even slow him down.  Well, that was a pretty weak tack they took on that one.  Hey, he's got a friend who says things and he said the same thing. 
[00:04:00]  Right.  So?  A speechwriter may have actually done that because sometimes speechwriters write for these guys.  Yeah.  Let's just say a couple of the out-of-work TV writers.  Somebody wrote for Clinton and Obama.  Uh-huh.  These speechwriters.  So who knows?  Somebody might have written that.  Yeah.  Of course.  Does it really matter either?  It reminds me of when I was in college and I was paying for, you know, final exams and  papers.  Good old coach in Geneseo writing my fine Russian history paper.  Cost me $200 for a B- because I didn't want to alert the teacher and all of a sudden get 
[00:04:30]  an A.  That would be crazy.  No, no.  They're going to come back now and take your diploma and you're not going to be able to  get a job.  Well, that's my scary dream.  I'm going to have over and over and over again.  They take your diploma and you get kicked out of your job?  That's my scary dream that I never graduated out of college.  Technically, I didn't.  I cheated.  I cheated the last year and a half.  You cheated your way through?  Yeah, because I was bored.  Good man.  And I was already doing radio.  I'm like, well, why am I going to work really hard in the Russian history class when I have 
[00:05:00]  a radio show to do?  Yeah.  For 15 to 20 people.  Busy.  Right.  So what, you actually really, as you were saying, I'm like, I wonder if that is something  that freaks them out, because you mentioned that once in a while.  Are you really afraid that they'll find out or that they'll come and take the diploma?  I don't know.  Yeah.  It's just one of those weird, scary dreams.  I think a lot of people have them.  It's a good thing you've kept it to yourself.  I know.  Hey, Iraq, keep this under your hat if you ever heard. 
[00:05:30]  I'll put that haircut.  But, you know, God rest his soul, coach is no longer with us, but he took care of a  lot of us back in the day.  You had to find him in the smoky, the smoky idle hour way in the back.  He had his own table like he was a mafia boss.  He's over there.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Well, I'm going to, I'm going to down a pitcher of Roman Cokes before I go over there.  And then you kind of saunter over and he was very intimidating.  And he's like, yeah, what do you want?  I want to, I want to be minus in Russian history.  You got it.  Payment's due Friday. 
[00:06:00]  Would it run you?  I don't remember.  I think it was about 200 bucks.  200?  I'm saying 200.  That's worth it.  I think that's about right.  And this is, you know, I graduated Geneseo, what, 10 years ago now.  So, you know.  Let me.  Right.  Trying to do some math.  Okay.  30.  You know.  Hey, well, congrats.  30.  Do you ever feel like guilty about it or no?  No, not at all.  Okay.  No, I thought my schooling was a waste of time. 
[00:06:30]  I learned a lot about myself and I, and I got to do a radio show.  Ah, the classes that I thought were, were useful.  Yeah.  I worked hard in.  I took film classes and, and whatnot.  But these dumb, like, courses, all of a sudden they insist you have to learn about Russian  history or whatever the hell it was.  It might have been European history.  They might have lumped a bunch of countries together.  I don't remember.  Yeah, exactly why. 
[00:07:00]  That's great if you just want to learn about that yourself.  And, and if you do, you could probably do it out of school.  You just go to the library, get some books on it, and there you are.  Yeah.  I think, ah, whatever.  I think they got to restructure the entire school system if you really want to get into  this.  It's such a waste of time, a lot of these classes they throw at you, especially in high  school.  It's like, look, man, don't give a crap.  And then they always come up with some cockamamie idea why you need it. 
[00:07:30]  They just want, yeah, they want to keep you busy.  Yeah.  It's busy work.  So you don't try to make out with girls and stuff behind the school.  They just want to keep you busy.  Don't put a visine in the shop teacher's coffee or something.  Yeah, it's, it's busy work.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  I, I had more fun trying to figure out how to like, you know, cheat.  Yeah.  I, I, I've made the smallest cheat sheet ever.  I challenge anyone.  I had it down to little tiny letters. 
[00:08:00]  I had it down to my thumb.  Wow.  A piece of paper down to my thumb.  Wow.  What'd you write on the back of a list of E-Rock's accomplishments?  Oh, E-Rock.  Oh, poor E-Rock.  Oh, it's.  I'm kidding, E-Rock.  Oh, eight minutes in.  Yeah.  I'm kidding.  Oh.  And, uh, you know, and then I, I told a famous story with the, with the coach. 
[00:08:30]  So I, I make the deal like, uh, like I'm buying drugs, but it's not drugs.  It's like a, it's a, it's a grade.  Uh-huh.  And then the guy goes and has a heart attack.  I mean, now he's in, now he's in like, uh, in the hospital.  Oh, no.  And I, I don't know if I'm going to have the paper in time.  Where's my paperwork?  But then some of his underlings, or are they underlings?  Underling.  Underlings.  Uh, assured me that he's going to be just fine.  Yeah.  And sure enough, uh, I got my paper in time and I got exactly what I asked for, a B-.  I don't know how he did that. 
[00:09:00]  I think he was in cahoots with the professors.  I think he was splitting the money with the professors.  Yeah.  Because I think some of the professors, uh, knew this was B-.S. as well.  Mm-hmm.  Like, yeah, of course, why, why, like, study Russian history when this kid could be, you  know, studying communications?  That's what he really wants to do.  Mm-hmm.  So, where were we?  My God.  We went off on a little tangent, didn't we?  Yeah.  I think we were just waking people up.  Oh, Obama was, uh, kicking ass.  Oh, plagiarized. 
[00:09:30]  Uh, yeah, the plagiarism of, uh.  Right, right.  Speeches, and Hillary's big thing now is to goof on, uh, Obama about the speeches.  Right.  So, she's saying things like, you know, ah, you know, some people will give you speeches,  but, uh, we want to see action, as she tells everyone this in a speech.  As, as she's being pushed off every front page in America.  She's done.  And now they're just kind of, well, our papers are showing, uh, Obama and McCain.  Two huge pictures. 
[00:10:00]  Yep.  Obama and McCain.  And you're seeing that more and more now.  And you're seeing Hillary just kind of being pushed off the front page, pushed to the third  or fourth page at this point.  They want front runners up on the, uh, front page.  That's right.  They want the guys that are going to be battling it out for the presidency.  Not, uh, not some scrub robot talking, big, cankled, ugh.  Even the, uh, yeah, but she's got a theme song.  Does she?  She's got a theme song.  I'd love to hear it.  I would love to hear.  Hmm.  One, two, three, four. 
[00:10:30]  Who got my iPod?  Wisconsin, Ohio, Texas, and on to Penn State.  She's going to win them.  Obama's going to win them.  Give her just the chance, she'll make it.  Penny, a glass ceiling, she'll break it.  She's going to be your president.  Hillary Clinton.  Clinton.  I'm going to turn her back now.  Yeah.  Straight ahead and on the track now.  Make them to make our dreams come true. 
[00:11:00]  Hillary Clinton.  Stop whining.  Terrific.  There's nothing she can do.  Never heard the word impossible.  Stop whining.  Stop whining.  There's no time for a dream.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Quiet.  Got a dream and lots of know-how.  Make them to make our dreams come true.  How did you see that jerk?  Walking for us all day, yes, all day. 
[00:11:30]  Make all your dreams come true.  Walking for us all day, yes, all day.  Hello.  Hello.  Make our dreams come true.  This joke.  For me and you.  I found it, Jimmy.  We rarely use this one.  You're going to be hearing that a lot in the coming weeks.  I had to point out to Anthony just before Jimmy arrived that my favorite part of the 
[00:12:00]  song is when it just kicks in.  Yeah, yeah.  It makes me laugh so hard.  There's the beginning part, which is just kind of talking.  Just do that part.  And then when she kicks it in.  Where she sounds like a tranny?  Yeah, yeah.  The first, like, five seconds, she sounds like a tranny.  But then when it kicks in, that is fantastic.  Like, this part is the tranny.  One, two, three, four, five, six, two thousand feet.  Wisconsin, Ohio, Texas, and on to Penn State.  That's a tranny. 
[00:12:30]  But you got to hear the other part.  You got to do that.  I love the change.  And then this is the part that cracks me up.  She's going to do it.  Do it.  Give a minute.  Oh, shut up.  Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.  She's going to be our president.  Jesus.  Shut up.  No, she's not.  Is that a white woman or a black woman?  I don't know why I'm picturing a black woman.  That's got to be a black woman. 
[00:13:00]  I don't know.  She sounds pretty white.  Really?  Really?  Yeah.  Really?  Really?  I come in prepared now because I know you're going to be yelling and screaming about Obama  and black and white.  I'm almost resigning myself to the fact.  Let me give you some stats from Wisconsin.  Okay.  He won about half of the white women vote, a group dominated by Clinton in previous elections.  He cleaned up among white men, 59%, to Clinton's 38%. 
[00:13:30]  Obama picked up half of the voters with incomes, well, under 50,000 per year.  Yeah.  He was favored by six of 10 independents, and about 50% were first-time voters who like  Obama's change message.  Yeah.  So I'll give you two out of the five over there.  Yeah.  But everyone is voting for this guy.  Every demo.  I think Drudge Report was basically saying he won every demo.  Every demo, every breakdown.  But do they know what he's planning? 
[00:14:00]  Huh?  But do they know what he's planning?  It doesn't matter.  He'll just sound good messing up.  That's all.  He'll sound good messing up the country.  Yeah.  He'll just sound.  Let's say hi to Fred in Wisconsin.  Fred.  Hello, Fred.  Fred.  Hello.  Hey, Rick.  What are you boys doing this morning?  We're talking to Cheeseheads.  I am one of those.  Hey, I know how Barack won.  Oh. 
[00:14:30]  He just burned up the phone lines.  I got eight phone calls.  Three from robo dialers and five real people called me.  Wow.  Did I vote for Barack?  And did you go out and vote for Barack?  Hell no.  Yeah.  See, that marking doesn't work.  The phone call.  The phone call doesn't work.  The old cold call.  Yeah.  Look, you know what?  Anthony, if Barack Obama personally called you.  Him himself.  Yeah.  Think this out.  Hello, Anthony.  Before you answer.  Okay.  And he actually called you personally and said, please vote for me. 
[00:15:00]  You would have to vote for him because now you would have some kind of connection to  the guy.  If I was Barack Obama, I would just be calling just radio guys.  Radio guys.  Yeah.  Start with radio guys.  I'd actually probably.  No, I'm not in the same.  I would probably say, how did you get my number?  And do you also have my address?  Then I'd have the locks changed.  Would you yell, prank caller, prank caller, prank caller, prank caller.  I don't know you.  Yeah.  Well, there you go.  The cheese heads.  Cheese heads. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, yeah.  All of them seem to like Obama, huh?  Yeah.  That's great.  Congrats to Obama.  Oh, boy.  We're too.  Gary in Atlanta.  What's up?  What's going on, man?  Atlanta.  What's up, Gary?  Freak Nick.  Yo, we're going to Freak Nick.  I think they shut down Freak Nick.  Yes, they did.  They call it something else now.  I'm originally from Brooklyn, so it doesn't matter to me. 
[00:16:00]  I hear you.  All right.  But I'm good with Anthony.  I think Barack's wife is going to mess it up for him.  Yeah.  Yeah, what she's talking about, this is the first time she's proud of America.  I think she's going to screw it up for him.  She's going to hand it over to Hillary or McCain.  Yeah, I don't.  I'm with Anthony.  We disagree as far as this election goes.  Yeah.  I totally.  I'm in agreement with Anthony as far as Barack's wife goes, man.  She scares me. 
[00:16:30]  She's a loose cannon, as they say.  She just babbles.  What did she say?  This is the first time.  Yeah, Gary just said it.  The first time she's proud of America.  The first time?  First time.  Thanks.  Can we get that clip?  Thanks a lot.  You know, Whitey's done some amazing things in this country, but she's not proud yet until  now.  Well, even if she wants to play the black angle, you know, she should have been a bit proud  when Jackie Robinson, you know, broke the color barrier.  That would have been a nice moment to be proud of America. 
[00:17:00]  How about when Neil Armstrong stepped out on the moon?  He's white.  Exactly.  But a proud moment for America, for God's sake.  Why is that a proud moment?  Because it was a bunch of people that got together and built the technology and went  to the moon and brought guys back.  And what did we get?  Some rocks.  What did we really get from that?  Cool pictures.  What else?  The ability to say that we beat you, you rooshkies.  Yeah, but the other planets laugh at us.  The planet is fighting over what part of the planet got to the moon first. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, I know.  That is stupid.  They laugh at us.  In the overall scheme of things, that's kind of ridiculous.  It's like some guy getting all happy.  He drove to the end of his driveway and back.  Right.  And you're like, dude, well, I just went cross country.  Exactly.  Yeah.  You know, I said I'm an alien and I got five eyes and 14 noses.  But, you know, I drove cross country.  You drove to the end of your driveway. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  We're making some miles here.  All right, Gary.  Thank you, sir.  You guys have a good day.  Oh, you too, man.  Let's say hi to Jay in Cleveland listening to us live, which is very, very cool for everybody.  What's up, Jay?  Hey, what's happening, boys?  Hey, man.  Hey there, Jay.  I just wanted to point out, remember your MacBook contest when you had that one chick  that sung, I Saw the Signs?  That sounds exactly like the Hillary song, girl.  Oh, with the, I saw the signs.  You really think so?  I don't know.  You got that alphoretic thing. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, let me find it.  I'm finding it for you.  Yeah, this girl came in.  We did a little karaoke for a MacBook.  We got to do that contest again.  We had so much fun with that.  Yeah, and this is just a taste of what she did.  Oh, she awful.  Those are not the words.  You're not the one for me. 
[00:19:00]  I love that dumb bitch. 
[00:19:30]  Pamela from Deer Park.  You're sexy, too, man.  Pamela, you dunce.  Yeah.  It's fantastically bad.  One, two, three, four, five, six, two thousand.  East Wisconsin, Ohio.  Get ready.  When it kicks in, here we go, everybody.  She's gonna do it.  It's just a chance she'll make it.  No, she won't.  Any glass ceiling she'll break it.  No, she can't.  She's gonna be your president.  No, she won't.  God. 
[00:20:00]  That sounds very similar, though, huh?  Yeah.  That's just awful.  What are you doing over there?  Nothing.  You're up to something.  What are you doing over there?  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  I was just thinking, she's going to be our president.  Beating the ****.  Just add in a few more lines and maybe, you know, punch it up a little.  You know, this would be a perfect, perfect place to play our nominee from yesterday for 
[00:20:30]  Black History Month.  Calm everybody down.  Nothing's gonna turn that back now.  She is white and he is black now.  She's gonna be our president.  Beating that ****.  Sometimes I'm a bad boy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sometimes.  Sometimes.  Sometimes I'm a bad boy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's good.  All right. 
[00:21:00]  Well, we better add this.  I was only joking.  Yeah, I was only joking.  Where's a scrub intern?  What happened?  Could I get a nail clipper?  Oh, Angel.  What happened?  I don't know.  Some things disappeared from my house.  I need a nail clipper.  Hey, why don't we take a break?  This is the nominee from yesterday for Black History Month.  We'll have a new one later on this morning.  I didn't have a home invasion.  It was an inside job.  Hey, here's a...  I just need a nail clipper.  My nails feel long and I don't want to...  You want to bite them for you? 
[00:21:30]  ...shake Locke's hand with long fingernails.  Oh, yeah.  We got Locke from our...  ...finger nails.  ...Loss coming in.  Come on.  And Louis Black.  Louis Black at 8 o'clock.  We'll talk politics with Louis Black.  That I haven't done in a while.  You and him are in total agreement, I believe.  He is going to agree with me 100%, especially on my stand on socialism.  I just see his fingers pointing at me and a lot of yelling.  Yeah, his crooked fingers.  Yes.  How long has he called you insane?  You're insane!  McCain's going to...  Are you crazy? 
[00:22:00]  You're insane!  Oh, it's always good.  Do you hear yourself?  He gets so upset with me.  With that arthritic finger of his...  Oh, and he just points it at you.  Ugh.  Can't even point right.  It's just all over the place.  No, it's bent and crooked and he's just...  Ugh.  ...mad at you for what you're saying.  Doesn't like that you have an opinion.  Yeah.  McCain!  What?  You didn't say that!  Yes, I did.  I can't wait.  Louis Black is great for this radio show. 
[00:22:30]  All right, hey, here's the nominee from yesterday for Black History Month.  We'll have a new one later on this morning, but just in case you missed it, it's Opie and Anthony.  In honor of Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony show is honoring black heroes, African-American individuals throughout history,  without whom this country would not be the melting pot it is today.  Today, we honor the mulhawked, bejeweled, one-time bouncer, former professional wrestler, recording artist, and born-again Christian, Mr. T,  who portrayed the pugnacious pugilist James Clever Lang in the 1982 film Rocky III. 
[00:23:00]  Hey, woman!  Hey, woman!  Listen here.  Since your old man ain't got no heart, maybe you'd like to see a real man.  I bet you stay up late every night dreaming you had a real man, don't you?  I'll tell you what.  Bring your pretty little supper over to my apartment tonight, and I'll show you a real man.  He sure does have a way with the ladies, doesn't he?  Hey, woman!  Hey, woman!  Stay tuned for more icons of black history on the Opie and Anthony show.

[00:25:00]  Phone number.  We should just change our show to rotten.  The rotten.  Yes, we're rotten.  Right, just an awful logo that just hurts your eyes when you look at it.  That's rotten.  Right.  Hey, can we do a parody on those dumb fresh stations?  I want a radio station called Rotten.  Rotten.  This is rotten.  You think they're really going to do the parody?  I don't know, because he's going to need me to do it. 
[00:25:30]  Welcome to Rotten.  92.3 Rotten.  What else could you do with a station called Rotten?  Have homeless DJs.  Oh, yeah.  That just stink.  Yeah.  Like a tippy.  All right.  So I was watching American Idol.  We're going to have to get into this a little later.  Yeah.  Because I feel like we should watch American Idol, because we're trying to be in touch with  what's going on out there, right?  I agree, but I've lost interest completely. 
[00:26:00]  I was on the phone, Ant, and I was taking a peek, and I don't know what's going on, man,  but they got a bunch of twinks trying to be the next American Idol.  Are you saying they have a bunch of young, thin, hairless, homosexual lads?  They're twinks.  They're like emo twinks.  Emo twinks.  It's really bizarre.  I'm like, I was watching last night, and I watched the auditions a little bit for the  goof factor, and then that was, that's even getting old. 
[00:26:30]  And so then a couple weeks went by, and I'm like, all right, they finally got the 24 contestants.  I got to take a peek, right?  And well, one twink after another.  What are they doing?  Oh, boy.  I guess they realized that Sanjaya was so popular last year that they decided to fill  the show up with twinks this year.  I would think that the show's being watched by young girls, and they seem to enjoy the  twink.  And older men.  Old men, yeah.  And older bears.  Yeah, big bear-like men. 
[00:27:00]  Yes, I enjoy the program.  I don't, but something's going on.  Yeah.  Anyone else noticing this?  Anybody out there?  I would guess people that watch it.  You want a little taste?  We were going to go with the Obama audio, but we'll get to that, where she said that  she's...  Taste of a twink.  I'll listen to it.  She's saying she's proud of America for the first time.  We'll get to that audio, but...  Yeah, what the hell?  It's an observation I had last night.  I don't know.  See if I'm onto something here, okay? 
[00:27:30]  We meet a guy named Colton.  Colton.  How many Coltons are out there, and how many parents thought they came up with something?  Like, look, my kid's going to be named a little different than everyone else.  And then they make it to, like, what?  Kindergarten, and they notice there's seven other Coltons in the class.  But we named him Colton.  He was copycats.  Because everyone got the new age baby naming book you ate.  Yes.  When does the twink named Travis show up on the...  Well, they all look kind of like a Travis. 
[00:28:00]  Do they?  Look at this thing.  What is that?  That's not a guy.  That's...  Colton Berry.  That's a girl with a tie.  Tell you what, I like to bury and...  Looks like Ellen.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Yes, exactly.  Here's Colton.  Listen to this.  I'm 18 years old.  I'm from Stanton, Virginia, and I'm a student.  I decided to audition for American Idol just because it was kind of my dream.  I followed it from season one, and I've been enjoying the ride.  It's a blast.  So I was sitting there with the rest of the top 50 on the Final Judgment show, and I have 
[00:28:30]  a wonderful technique of singing the Teletubbies theme song in my head whenever I feel nervous.  And that's what I did for about three hours.  All right.  Look, I got nothing against the homosexual people.  I'm not even saying that.  But they obviously are going for something here.  That's what I'm saying.  I would say, based on what he was talking about and the way he was saying it, that in 
[00:29:00]  my personal opinion, I would peg him as a gay guy.  A twink.  A twink.  I'm not going to say he's gay, but I'll bet there's not a pillow in that house without teeth  prints in it.  I'll bet he can tie his shoes.  His face probably touches his shin when he ties his shoes.  Let's say hi to Flown.  He has no idea what it's like to sleep on his back.  Not at all.  Why would he?  No surprises can wake you up. 
[00:29:30]  What's that?  It's called a ceiling.  All houses have them.  Flounder.  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hope you are totally on the song.  These kids are beyond homosexual, though.  They're more like what Jimmy Stroll for in Manhattan.  These kids should be dressed as girls.  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  They're extremely...  Jimmy into this.  A bunch of them are extremely feminine.  I mean, I know every year they cast like...  They cast...  They're casting a reality show.  So you have to have the black dude that's down on his luck. 
[00:30:00]  You got to get the gay guy.  The person that doesn't think he's gay.  You got the big fat black woman.  You know, you got the rocker, dude.  The rocker.  You got the little girl from a little town that wants to sing country.  Yeah.  They're casting these roles every single season.  But something's going on this year, man.  It's not even fun to watch.  Yeah.  What happened to Chris Daughtry where he's just, you know, rocking?  He's just rocking out those...  He was the rocker. 
[00:30:30]  All right.  Well, that was Colton.  Now we meet David, just in case you thought I was, you know, crazy here.  I'm 17, and I'm from Murray, Utah, and go to Murray High School.  I'm waiting.  It was really fun when Randy started singing along with me.  It's like, oh, cool.  I'm singing with Randy.  You.  They said I was through to the top 24, and it was just like, oh, what a feeling.  That's nice.  Is it?  What was his favorite quote, Eric?  It was a quote.  They have quotes for them on the site. 
[00:31:00]  You'll never be lonely if you learn to befriend yourself.  Yeah, I bet.  And then...  You'll never be lonely if you bring a drill to a rest area.  Never be lonely if you have a wide stance.  Is that what happens, though?  Someone has to go there with a drill?  Doesn't somebody have to go there with a drill?  They don't come with a factory perforated circle.  Or does a guy just sit there on the ball and he just starts scratching away at the wall 
[00:31:30]  and slowly...  And he's not going to get the job done in one sitting, so he's gone.  And then the next guy has to scratch where that guy's scratched and eventually a hole  is formed.  I think it's just one guy who will look left and look right outside the door, see no  headlights, and then go in there and just drill ferociously.  Yeah, it's not a team effort.  It doesn't take as long as a, I don't know, Shawshank, you know?  I'm just thinking...  One quick...  He'll drill real quick and then he probably is quiet.  Yeah, but how do you walk in with a drill? 
[00:32:00]  I'm thinking it's got to be a hand drill that you got down your leg, like...  No, you put it in a...  Pants or whatever.  You put it in a bag or something, like you carry a satchel of some sort, you pop out  like the cordless...  Ah, that's true, yeah.  Cordless Makita.  I mean, you run out and you look, no headlights, all right, you come back in, you make the  hole a little wider.  I'll tell you what else you probably need, a little bit of sandpaper.  Sure.  To get in and around there to take the burrs off of the edge of the hole to make it nice  and smooth because you don't want to splinter. 
[00:32:30]  I gotcha.  Depends on the ethnicity of your new friend, you know?  The art of the glory hole.  Right.  That's right.  You got to know how to make those things.  You got to put your mouth on it on one side, it smells like somebody else's breath.  Like, you ever smell the underside of someone's lip?  It smells like the underside of people's lips.  And you can see one place, like, against the glory hole where the last person's nose  was pressed.  What the hell's wrong with you?  Hey, we got more David audio because Ryan starts flirting with the guy and then they bring 
[00:33:00]  up chicks.  Chicks.  Yeah, I bet.  I wasn't expecting that.  What were you expecting?  Um, well, I was just, you know, I don't know if it was like my best, so, you know, I'm  really odd that they, that that came out of them. 
[00:33:30]  Wow.  You're so likable.  You feel extremely comfortable on stage during the song.  You know, I love it, man.  Especially with the audience here.  Wow.  Yeah.  No, go ahead and join them.  No.  No.  No.  You only vote for him.  You actually can't adopt him, so.  I'm 17 and just 9 of it.  But the ladies love you.  No.  Oh, great.  Do they have to?  They love that they love you.  We'll be right back in a few. 
[00:34:00]  I love the fact that women that age have no clue.  They, you know.  No.  He's so cute.  You don't understand, do you?  You have no idea, man.  You poor little girl.  You have no idea.  You don't even get it.  Right.  See, there's a certain part you have that disgusts him.  Yes, that makes him go, ew.  He looks at that the way most of us look at garbage juice at the bottom of the truck.  Yeah, you ever see a garbage truck driving down the road and it's just pouring out the  back?  That's what you have?  Yeah, he has a better shot of laying under that and drinking that fluid than kissing 
[00:34:30]  that disgusting part you have.  He hates it.  That gaping wound, basically, where there's something missing.  He doesn't like that at all.  Mainstream media has a problem with homosexuality.  They don't want to acknowledge that these people could possibly be gay.  Yeah.  I remember it was Regis and I can't remember who was actually on with him and Regis is  like, when are you going to get married?  Was it Clay Aiken or something? 
[00:35:00]  He's done it to Clay, I believe, but it was somebody else that it's so freaking obvious.  Well, he's inept anyway.  Yeah, and Regis is just wondering, when are you going to get a girlfriend?  So, you've been out on the scene for a while.  I see a lot of girls are your fan base.  When are you getting married?  When are you popping the big question?  Regis, you've got to like the vagina, don't you?  And you sit at home, you watch this, and you get uncomfortable.  You're like, Regis, come on.  Now, our next guest, I'm going to ask him when he's getting hooked up. 
[00:35:30]  Let's bring him out.  Charles Nelson Reilly.  When are you getting married, for God's sake?  Thank you, Steve from Bayshore.  You got that?  I think they used to ask Liberace.  Liberace.  Liberace, you're a great piano player.  I'm sure a lot of girls find that very romantic.  When are you getting married?  I wish we could find audio of that.  What are you talking about? 
[00:36:00]  Oh, God, what is he?  Now, here's a man that just gets the girls swooning.  Swooning.  He's the star of McMillan and wife.  Let's bring him out.  Rock Hudson.  Rock Hudson.  How do you do it?  There's girls everywhere just fawning over you.  What do you mean you want to be buried upside down?  That old gang.  Maybe the boys could find some of that in the back.  That might be a tough find, but we're just talking to obvious gay guys, not chicks. 
[00:36:30]  Let's bring out a single man.  I don't understand why he doesn't have a girl.  He tries to keep in shape.  Mr. Richard Simmons.  Richard Simmons, come on out.  Girls adore you.  They're fatties, but they love you.  I think they might have done it to Nathan Lane.  Nathan Lane.  It's like, what?  He just doesn't know.  Regis doesn't understand it either.  He's so old school.  He doesn't get that there was this sexual revolution and gay people came out. 
[00:37:00]  He just doesn't understand.  Lead singer of a very popular band these days.  The band's queen.  Let's bring out Freddie Mercury.  Where's your girlfriend?  Here it is.  A beloved father through the 60s and 70s.  Raising three boys on his own until he met that wife of his, but not in real life.  Robin Reed, where's the girl?  He does it to women, too, like Billie Jean King is coming in. 
[00:37:30]  Billie Jean King!  What are you going to settle down with a man?  Settle down!  That's right, Mr. Elton John!  Where's your girl?  Just completely clueless.  All right.  Hey, well, now we meet the third twink trying to become the next American Idol.  I don't know what the hell's going on.  They're all the same.  Look at this.  Look at the pictures.  Yeah.  Look at them. 
[00:38:00]  You got the young, like, Leif Garrett-looking thing.  Garrett Haley.  Colton Berry.  Wow, look at him.  Is he gay to want to canoodle with Colton Berry?  That is a guy.  I don't know if it's gay, because look how, like, feminine they are, Jimmy.  How old is Garrett Haley?  17.  They're just 17-year-old, like.  You're a young boy.  There's plenty of time to find the right woman to settle down with. 
[00:38:30]  You know what the right woman is, don't you?  I do.  For you, one with a big ****.  Well, we meet Danny.  Let's see Danny's picture.  I'm 18 years old.  I'm from Azusa, California.  It's the same voice.  I like to wear nup colors.  I like to wear finger-nup colors.  Yeah, it's all the same voice.  What is that?  That swishy kind of.  That is a girl.  That's Janet from Three's Company. 
[00:39:00]  Danny Noriaga.  That is a girl.  What is that?  Come on, really, seriously.  That is a girl.  That's more feminine than male.  But this is what's going on on American Idol.  It's amazing how this sissy male.  That's what women want.  That's it.  Sissy.  They don't like men.  They like sissies.  I'm 18 years old. 
[00:39:30]  I'm from Azusa, California, and I'm currently unemployed.  You've got a very good voice, Danny.  Thank you very much, Simon.  Last year, I got cut the first day in Hollywood on stage.  It was pretty bad.  It was pretty hard.  I was, like, bawling for, like, the next week over.  The week after that, I was like,  Mom, I think I want to audition again.  I want to do this again.  She's like, this kid's crazy.  My name is William, and I like fingernail polish. 
[00:40:00]  My name is William, and I like to wear dresses.  Dresses.  I can get rid of all my male clothes.  I can get only girl clothes.  I will be happy looking like a woman.  Oh.  Last year, I tried to create this little image that I thought the judges were looking for,  and that was, I was going about it all wrong.  I was not being myself.  Tonight, when I perform my song, I want to bring my swagger and attitude on stage.  I want to be hot.  So. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, my God.  You know what it is, too?  I bet a lot of gay guys watch this show.  Yeah.  Love it.  And they know that a huge part of their audience is, like you said, young girls and gay guys.  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you?  They completely switched it up, though, Jimmy.  That's what I'm getting at.  Like, my swaggering attitude.  Do you?  I don't even remember.  Well, you had Sanjaya last year, but he was even more manly than these guys we've been playing.  That's a bold statement.  But he was, man. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  Listen to this voice.  This is a female.  I see you nodding your head and agreeing with, it sounds like grotesque.  He's nodding his head.  Grotesque, like, well, obviously he's bad, but, like, I didn't really, you know.  It's the opposite of good.  But you did say, at one point, when you saw him, he was the best of the day, and then the other end of the spectrum, grotesque.  What do you think went wrong?  What happened?  That's true.  God, right.  Song choice, I guess.  I don't know.  I kind of like the song.  I thought it would be fun for a first show, but, I don't know.  Some people weren't liking it.  Oh, he got all bitchy. 
[00:41:30]  Careful, he might double snap you back.  He snapped him?  There's my observation for today.  I was on the phone with you, and I'm like, one after another, I'm like, what are they doing with this show?  It's just a sissy culture.  Parading out.  You think that's what it is, Jimmy?  Sissies.  Yeah, of course.  The masculine attitude is gone.  I mean, DePaulo always talks about it, and he's right about the way men are in the commercials,  and the stupid dad. 
[00:42:00]  That's what they're comfortable with, a non-threatening, sissy male.  The young emos with their, you know, ambiguous kind of sexuality, and their eye makeup, and their hair.  Yeah.  And they have to be very feminine.  I don't subscribe to traditional roles.  No.  You know, the traditional view of family isn't what I subscribe to.  I like families with two dads. 
[00:42:30]  Do you?  Yes, I like penguins who sleep together.  Let's say hi to Derek in Jersey.  Derek.  Derek.  Hey.  Hey, I want to know if Steve C is the fourth judge for American Idol.  Yeah.  You're longer.  I like this young lad.  He's very good.  I saw a lot of emotion.  He reminds me of myself when I was in Foundry, except he can sing and he's not wearing a dress.  It's not 8,000 pounds. 
[00:43:00]  I like his attitude and swagger.  Let's go to Mike in Jersey.  Mikey.  Hey, boys.  How you doing?  Pretty good, bro.  Hey, listen.  These guys remind me of gay Marco.  Maybe you could play that clip where he eats a peach.  Big, big, big.  Wow, that's one that will get you fired if you do that nowadays.  Really?  You can't do that anymore?  I don't know.  We should just throw that online.  We should throw that on onaradio.com or something. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, that's a good one.  We had a gay guy come in.  What was it for?  Do you remember, Mike?  What tickets?  NSYNC.  NSYNC tickets.  He was a huge NSYNC fan.  This guy, Gay Marco, who became a friend of the show.  He did a lot of things for us.  And he wanted to go to NSYNC so badly that we made him, well, have a form of sex with  a girl.  Yeah.  Live on our show.  Yeah.  And the noises and the crying.  Oh, he hated it.  He started crying.  Yeah, he was.  It was his first view of a nude woman, is what it was. 
[00:44:00]  And I remember him just going, ew, what is that?  Like, he didn't know anything.  Can we at least get that clip, Iraq, where he did?  What is that?  I don't have to explain it, but we could at least have the clip of him going, ew, what  is that?  And then him just breaking down and crying.  Huh?  He saw a string down there, didn't he?  No, that was probably one of our bits that we did, and now you're giving too much information  and now you have a problem with what we're talking about. 
[00:44:30]  Probably a problem, thank you.  All right, Mike, now we have to say goodbye to you and take our break here.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Stay there.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Trying to figure out what else is going on in the world today.  You know, Obama won Wisconsin and Hawaii.  Yeah.  What does he get for Hawaii?  Like a half a delegate?  I don't know.  They seem to have a few.  They had more than I expected.  I'm not sure how many.  More than Rhode Island? 
[00:45:00]  I don't know.  I don't know either.  I don't know.  It's his home state, though.  He was born there.  Yeah.  He's Hawaiian and black and white.  He's a multicultural guy.  Here's your rundown.  This is getting our attention today.  You got Castro.  Castro's running.  How many delegates?  Basically retiring.  Oh.  We got the U.S. shooting down a broken satellite.  What's that about?  There's some space age stuff going on there, huh?  Yeah.  Secrets, I believe. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  Because they're shooting it down, it looks like, over the Pacific Ocean.  It looks like it's not going to make land.  It looked like it could harmlessly fall into the Pacific, but they're going to shoot one  of these missiles off of a ship and intercept it and hopefully bash it into a thousand pieces  so it just burns up in the atmosphere.  And they say it's because there's a lot of rocket fuel, very toxic, deadly rocket fuel on it.  But it's a spy satellite.  So there's a lot of secrets on there you don't want people getting their hands on. 
[00:46:00]  They're just trying out their Star Wars program, finally.  That's another thing, too.  Finally.  It's a great way to kind of see how easy it is to intercept something moving at almost  25,000 miles an hour in space.  Sure.  How far above the Earth is it right now?  There you go.  About a quarter of a mile.  Perhaps more than that, Hopi.  Do you know?  No.  It's low Earth orbit.  What is it?  Probably 100 miles up?  Something like that?  Between probably 100, 120? 
[00:46:30]  I'm guessing.  Because I know that's kind of low Earth orbit.  And it's broken.  They can't.  The little rocket didn't work.  Why can't they just send a man up to repair it?  Because they don't want anyone peeking in this thing.  I don't know what's going on.  You know, there's probably an alien in this frigging thing.  No kidding.  And they just want to blow it up.  They don't want us knowing what's on there.  Yeah.  We got that going on.  We got a 25-year-old sex offender posing as a teen. 
[00:47:00]  And then he takes a 14-year-old to a school dance.  Oh, that's cute.  Isn't that cute?  You got the girl born with eight legs.  We did the story.  The update on her.  She's taking...  Oh, octopus girl?  Yeah.  She's taking her first steps.  Is she?  They got rid of, I don't know, half the legs.  I think she still has a few.  Yeah.  A few extra ones.  I'm not really positive.  But she's starting to walk.  Can she crush crustaceans with her beaked mouth?  Probably.  Octopus girl.  Bringing back half her shoes.  You got an intoxicated man sitting on a two-month-old, his own grandson. 
[00:47:30]  I thought it was a radio contest.  Right.  The longest person to sit on there wins a car or something.  Wait, is the kid okay?  No, the kid is dead, Jimmy.  Ah.  He killed his own grandson because he's an alcoholic and he passed out after he stabbed him.  Oh, no.  Oh, that's a tragic little story, isn't it?  That's not good.  But then he got a 7.5 magnitude earthquake hitting Indonesia and Sumatra. 
[00:48:00]  Tsunami alert.  And Sumatra.  Yeah.  Is that going to affect our coffee?  Hmm.  Hope not.  When I go into, you know.  Quick check.  Yeah.  When I go into one of these coffee joints and I see Sumatra.  Yeah.  I didn't know it was named after an actual place.  Yes, it's part of Javariety.  The country of Javariety?  Yes.  I've visited Javariety.  It's a wonderful place.  And then you got a Gene Simmons sex tape and Jimmy ran out of the studio to check it out. 
[00:48:30]  And what do you think, Jimmy?  He wanted to confirm.  Well, it's black and white and it's a smoking girl whose ass just brings tears to your eyes.  Apparently having oral treats and then sex with a guy who looks exactly like Gene Simmons.  I mean, it's hard to tell because there's no dialogue and it's taken from about, say, six feet away.  Uh-huh.  But the guy really looks like Gene, although you can't get a close up on the face until he's on his back.  That's suspect.  And then on the back, the profile really looks like him. 
[00:49:00]  And it's funny, while they're having sex, she goes to touch his head, but because it's the wig, her hand jerks.  Yeah, you don't want to pull that wig off.  That kind of looks like him.  It looks a lot like him.  Yeah, what's up with the implants, man?  Look at the body.  She's a spokesman in Germany.  Really?  Beautiful body, man.  Hey, gee, what's she doing there?  Wow, there's a couple.  Wow, there's like a split screen here.  You got a bunch of action going on.  How we doing, people? 
[00:49:30]  He's talking, all right?  Is he freaking using his BlackBerry as she, like, does her thing to his thing?  Then it's definitely him.  He's probably trying to make money off of the tape they haven't yet made.  He's putting something over it to make sure.  Oh, is that what was going on?  Because it looked like he was, like, emailing someone on a BlackBerry, but there was something in his hand that he needed for the act.  I love the fact that his dumb pants are still up.  Now, watch a second.  Right now, they're going at it a little bit.  Gene's just starting.  And watch, watch. 
[00:50:00]  You see, you're going to touch the hair and jerk her hand back.  Jerk the hand back, yeah.  Well, what do we know about this tape, by the way?  Does he know about it?  I'm sure he does.  Secretly?  Well, he knows now, but, I mean, did he know ahead of time?  It doesn't look like it, no.  Like this lady decided to just film him?  I think so, yeah.  But it's obviously a hidden camera.  Yeah, so what do we got on this?  What do we know about this?  I don't know, Steve?  And a word on the street.  And are we allowed to, why would Steve be close as we talk about this?  He's the only one that knows about this sex tape.  This was taken. 
[00:50:30]  I was hiding in a closet.  Steve, what do we know about this?  Yeah, what's going on?  It just hit the, I saw it on avn.com last night, and it was one of the websites, I think it's  on there, genesecret.com, released it, and it's one of these sex tape brokers, and I'm  not sure if he knows, or if he's fighting it yet, but I'm sure he's going to have a statement  soon.  Look at her ass.  I mean, she's really fantastic.  Why would he fight it?  He was secretly taped.  Unless that's the gag. 
[00:51:00]  Unless that's the gimmick.  Yeah, because now you don't know, because like Joey Buttafuoco's claiming that he was  secretly taped because they were at some kind of party, and he decided to go have sex with  his chick in the middle of a party, a room in this place, and then said that they were  secretly taped.  It's like, stop.  That's the angle.  That's the gag.  The gag is, we were secretly taped, you know?  But that's Joey Buttafuoco.  This is Gene Simmons worth substantially more, and a tape like this could be substantially more  damaging if it is him.  So, how is it damaging?  He openly admits that he bangs everything in sight. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, he's banging a 10.  This won't hurt Gene at all.  And it's not clear enough.  It's not a good enough tape that would be set up by Gene.  Like, it's not clear enough, or the sex isn't hot enough for it to have been his.  I mean, he would go, yeah, that's good.  Let's release that and pretend I don't know.  Yeah, because he would have definitely had a lot of profile shots and a lot of close-ups  on his face.  Yeah.  Because it's all about Gene.  Oh, wow.  There's more fun.  Always.  Yeah.  Always there.  All right.  Well, there you go.  Check it out before they get rid of it.  I'm sure they're going to get rid of it, right? 
[00:52:00]  I'm sure.  I'll tell you what it is.  He must have, if it's Gene, he was obviously having something with this woman because there's  a bunch of footage of him having sex, so she probably just set him up.  Could be.  Yeah.  All right.  And in other news, before the break, we were talking about Gay Marco and what he did  for NSYNC tickets.  Ew.  We can't play the bit, but we can play one clip that I think is really, really funny  because basically Gay Marco was desperate for NSYNC tickets.  He said he would do anything, and he's as gay as they come, man. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, yeah.  There's no question whatsoever.  None more gay.  And we made him do something to a girl for the NSYNC tickets.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  It's, you know, a practice that is usually reserved to some type of foreplay.  Yes.  If a gentleman is doing this to a young lady, he usually would find it very difficult to  whistle a happy tune as he was doing it.  That's right.  Well, listen to the clip.  This is the trooper, the girl that came in. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  Getting ready.  Mm-hmm.  And then Gay Marco's reaction is just classic.  Oh, my God.  No, Marco, get out.  Don't leave.  Marco, get out.  Marco, come here.  Come back.  Marco, come here.  Come here.  Marco, look at him.  He's confused.  No, Marco, come here.  Come here.  What was that?  No, Marco.  Marco, it's a woman.  It's a woman, Marco. 
[00:53:30]  I wish we could play that whole thing.  He lost his mind looking at a woman in the most womanly of areas.  Yeah.  He didn't know what it looked like, so he didn't know what to expect.  Right.  So when he saw it, he just lost his mind.  Well, someone's got to host that bit for us because I think the newbies need to hear  that.  You replay it on regular radio, you're fired. 
[00:54:00]  Simple as that.  That's just the way it is.  It was extremely graphic for this day.  I think, like, heterosexual guys know that certain areas come in many shapes, sizes, colors,  textures.  There's sometimes everything is very neat.  Sometimes it looks a little sloppier, let's say.  And I think he had this illusion that all of them were the same and everything was, you 
[00:54:30]  know, like a clamshell that's hard to shuck, you know?  And meanwhile, I think he was looking at some, I don't know, mussels that were cooked in marinara  and it scared the crap out of him.  It was a very, very fun day.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Moving forward here, so we got the audio, finally, of Obama's wife. 
[00:55:00]  Ah.  She's going to just mess up Barack's campaign.  Like, Anthony.  She better start now.  Anthony said this months ago and I'm so with him.  He's running away with this.  Well.  She's loose cannon.  Yeah, this is what she said, in case you missed it.  For the first time in my adult lifetime, I'm really proud of my country.  And not just because Barack has done well, but because I think people are hungry for change.  You think that's just a slip up or does she really change thing? 
[00:55:30]  Or does she really mean that she's happy for the first time?  She's happy with the country for the first time.  And it's all because her husband, a black guy, has the opportunity to be a president.  Everything before that sucked and reeked of racism.  So she's, yeah, a little upset with the way America was run.  Forget the fact that, you know, throughout history and, of course, during the Industrial 
[00:56:00]  Age, everything that the world depends on now pretty much came out of this country or Germany.  Yeah, forget about that.  Now we can be proud.  Thank God for Mrs. Barack Obama.  Yuck.  She wasn't proud when the NHL finally accepted the first black player?  No, apparently not.  This is the first time.  Which was two years ago?  Yeah.  Than's pointing out that.  Hillary Clinton, I'm sorry, does she have Botox? 
[00:56:30]  Maybe she didn't.  Look at her.  It looks like she's storing, like, those things.  You know how you put those frozen packs on your, a wound or an injury?  Right.  She looks like she has one in each cheek.  She doesn't look beautiful at all.  Yeah.  Well, did you say Hillary?  I did, Opie.  Why?  I was just wondering.  Huh.  I wonder how she's going to do.  One, two, three, four, five, six, two thousand, eight.  Wisconsin, Ohio, Texas, and on to Penn State.  She's going to do it.  Give her just a chance, she'll make it. 
[00:57:00]  Any glass ceiling, she'll break it.  She's going to be your president, Hillary Clinton.  Anyway, Than was pointing out that they weren't sure if they should clap when Obama's wife said what she said.  They were kind of awkwardly didn't know what to do in the audience.  Listen again.  For the first time in my adult lifetime, I'm really proud of my country. 
[00:57:30]  And not just because Barack has done well, but because I think people are hungry for change.  Yeah.  Should we clap with this?  Wow.  I love her.  She's a problem.  She's certainly a problem.  Yeah, she's a big mouth.  And then John McCain's wife decided to have fun with that.  I'm proud of my country.  I don't know about you if you heard those words earlier.  I'm very proud of my country.  Yeah.  That's the best she could do with that? 
[00:58:00]  She stinks, too.  She's no good.  I don't know if you heard, but I'm proud of my country, too.  How about I've always been proud of my country?  Yeah, that's just because my husband is doing well.  Right, right.  How about a genuine jab?  Yeah, that would have been fine.  Simon says, put your hands over your head.  Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. McCain.  You're out.  He got tortured.  He got tortured.  I know the poor bastard at Hanoi Hilton.  Vietnam.  Vietnam.  He was in country getting beat up. 
[00:58:30]  Poor guy.  Crab arms.  I want to dip his arms in butter and enjoy them.  Butter sauce.  Leave him alone.  Yeah.  Speaking of Vietnam, I brought in a bit of audio today.  Spuds Buckley in the Numb?  No.  Didn't me and you fly a blimp over Hanoi?  No.  No?  I thought we did something like that.  Well, we started a bit, I don't know, over a month ago now.  Old school Opie and Anthony. 
[00:59:00]  Basically, because I'm finally unloading boxes and boxes of stuff.  And today I bring to the show a radio show from 1970.  I remember that was the year we first got together.  No.  In Vietnam.  Old school Opie and Anthony doesn't mean it's all just our stuff.  Oh.  Oh.  It's just stuff I've had in boxes for a very, very long time.  And I found this.  And wow. 
[00:59:30]  It's Dave Rabbit.  This guy.  Like, E-Rock was doing some research on this guy.  I had no idea.  I've had this tape.  Actually, my good friend Stork.  Yes.  Stork from Huntington.  He turned me on to this guy, Dave Rabbit.  And we've had this tape for years.  Years.  I've had this tape probably for like 20 years at this point.  And I gave it to E-Rock.  It's on a cassette.  Another one of these cassettes.  And E-Rock went through it and did some research.  And I guess he's a hero on the internet, right? 
[01:00:00]  Yeah, there's been this big thing surrounding him.  They never knew who the actual guy was up until a couple of years ago.  When the guy finally came out and said, no, this was me.  That was me.  And there's been clips of his broadcast circulated through the military for years.  And nobody knew who he was.  He has merchandise and everything that he made by hand back in 1970 where he was just drawing on old.  Made out of ears and teeth.  No kidding.  He would have some kind of paint. 
[01:00:30]  And he would just draw on these old sweatshirts and have Vietnamese kids selling them on the street for like two or three bucks.  Wow.  And these things are big collector's items.  And now he's residing in Dallas, Texas.  How old is he?  He's going to be 40.  Late 50s.  That's it?  Yeah.  Well, this tape is what?  37 to 38 years.  No, he's got to be.  Late 50s.  1970.  Well, maybe.  Is 37 years ago.  So he could have been 20.  Okay.  I suppose so. 
[01:01:00]  The youngsters were going to Vietnam.  So I think he's like 59.  All right.  That's about right.  All right.  Let's call him right around 60.  And this isn't good morning Vietnam stuff, by the way, because Jimmy asked me before the show.  No.  And this is not high energy.  This is a guy that is smoking a lot of weed or dropping something because he talks about acid a lot.  Some of the dope.  And he's just doing a show for the guys in the field.  And these guys are listening on their little transistor radios, wondering if they're going to survive the day.  Yeah.  Oh, is that him? 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why does he got to wear camo if he's on the radio?  I don't know.  So his name is Dave Rabbit.  And, you know.  He's going on a mission, I tell you, because we were all in camouflage when we bombed that TV station open.  Well, we had to take out the communications.  Yes, we did.  Wait.  What did you yell at those people again?  I don't remember.  You didn't remember?  No, I don't remember.  I don't remember.  I really, I don't remember. 
[01:02:00]  What?  What?  What are you guys doing?  Someone might have a recollection.  What are you doing over there?  What are you doing?  I think someone's remembering, maybe, what Opie yelled.  I don't remember.  The battle cry.  Well, maybe they can remember in a commercial break, because the pace of the show is killing me.  What are you doing?  He doesn't.  What are you doing?  I'm finding something that you.  Oh, my God.  Travis. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, my God.  Get back on the phone.  You little twink.  Anyway, continuing the old school Opie and Anthony bit we started a while ago.  So, I present you with Dave Rabbit today from 1970, 1971.  Just a taste here.  We got a bunch of clips.  How did nobody know who he was?  Were these pictures new?  Were they always out or no?  No, the pictures only came out a couple years ago.  He actually released a letter to a couple of press organizations stating the history behind the tapes, who he was, etc.  Everything but his real name. 
[01:03:00]  I need to know more about this guy.  So, here we go.  Dave Brings the Truth and Hard Acid Rock.  Listen to this.  Good evening again, ladies and gentlemen.  This is your host for the next three hours of Hard Acid Rock music, Dave Rabbit.  For those of you who have just recently come into the Republic of Vietnam, I'd like to give you a little information about it,  so your mind won't be quite so blown when you hear such words as f*** and words of that nature. 
[01:03:30]  We're an underground radio station here, and we say what we feel like saying.  And we bring the truth to the first-termers in the Republic of Vietnam.  We also bring you Hard Acid Rock music all through the night.  The up-to-date music of today's American youth.  I like this guy, man.  How cool is that? 
[01:04:00]  That's not good, buddy, Vietnam!  This is the real deal, man.  That's history.  How crazy is that?  I like that stuff.  He sounds like he has a cool voice, like Rod Sterling, and he just sounds high.  Yeah.  Oh, he's probably so goddamn high.  Underground, does that mean he ran it or he was renting space?  How does that work?  You know what?  I didn't know anything about this guy.  E-Rock is actually helping me out.  He tried to get a job on the Armed Force Radio Network. 
[01:04:30]  He was interning there.  Which is the Good Morning Vietnam type of guy.  They wouldn't let him go on the air.  They wouldn't let him touch any of the equipment,  so he just hung around and watched how they did everything.  Through some creative trading, he got some equipment and was renting a room in the back of a whorehouse in Vietnam.  And they tiled the studio with these one-inch tiles and mattresses to kind of deaden the sound so you wouldn't hear all the sex going on around the while they were broadcasting.  So it's him and two other servicemen are doing their show in the back room and just transmitting. 
[01:05:00]  First, they started illegally.  They were tapping over the Armed Force Radio Network signal before their time check and everything at 8 o'clock at 7.59.  They were saying, Armed Force is opening up a second channel, flip to 69 on your FM dial there, and listen to radio first-termer.  And then at 8 o'clock, the signal would hit and the radio network would kick in.  So then everybody flipped over to 69 and started listening to this for like a year and a half. 
[01:05:30]  Did you intern for them, E-Rock?  Because I know you made the rounds in a lot of radio stations.  No?  No.  Why did you?  This is, what's his name?  David Rabbit.  I like the garlic butter saw.  Garlic butter saw here in country.  Isn't that a great story, though?  It was underground radio, man.  He was like telling the real truth of what was going on, you know, in the field.  This is your first time in the Republic of Vietnam.  Try the garlic butter saw.  And the acid.  Yeah.  You want to hear a little more?  Yeah, man.  So cool.  All right, this is Dave Rabbit. 
[01:06:00]  A message from the latrine walls.  He used to do a bit.  He did bits.  Simple bits.  But it was called A Message from the Latrine Walls.  Give me the information.  During the night, we're going to be reading some of the things off of latrine walls around  the Republic of Vietnam.  One of them.  While I'm home, my wife is my right hand.  While I'm away, my right hand is my wife.  The cooking from the big 69. 
[01:06:30]  From the who.  The who.  Yeah.  Pinball wizard.  How cool is that?  As you just blast in a .50 cal over a trench.  Right.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Wonderful.  Yeah, I think they were trying to find this guy, too.  He was getting way too popular.  They didn't want, uh, they didn't, they didn't, they didn't, pretty dirty for, uh, the, the  day, huh?  Yeah.  Well, there was no FCC, right?  You're in the middle of nowhere. 
[01:07:00]  Of course not.  You want one more before the break?  I want many more.  I love this guy.  Yeah.  This guy's got a great delivery.  Yeah.  He's more cool.  I want to start doing that.  More Dave Rabbit.  Yeah, let's just all talk as much like him.  Like Dave Rabbit.  Pinball wizard by the who.  I've had quite a few letters recently, uh, concerning some of the different items that,  uh, Radio First Termer has to offer his followers.  And one of the biggest things is the official Dave Rabbit sweatshirt. 
[01:07:30]  For those of you who are unaware of what a Dave Rabbit sweatshirt is, I'll tell you, it's  a white sweatshirt.  On the front of it, it has a large, white rabbit.  And the rabbit's s**t is completely h*****y.  The rabbit is carrying a sign.  On the sign, it reads, f***** it, before it f*****s you.  If you like one of these Dave Rabbit sweatshirts, send a postcard along with 298. 
[01:08:00]  298.  The rabbit sweatshirt, Radio Saigon, Underground, APO in country, 96969.  Cream.  Cream.  And the hits just keep on coming.  How cool is that?  He's my favorite radio person ever. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, that guy's delivery's great.  The material's great.  I've had this tape for over 20 years, man.  I finally found it in a box.  Let me ask you a question, though.  With this guy, if he's giving out an address and stuff like that, and he's got letters,  how could he do that?  If the government wanted him gone, they would have traced him.  So how did that happen?  From what I understand, a lot of that stuff, they really, the government was having a hard  time because it would go to fake businesses or just farm people.  Like, here's the address, and then there'd just be a farmhouse there. 
[01:09:00]  And they would just drop the mail off at these places, and somebody would eventually come  around and pick it up.  Oh, okay.  The guy was just a tech geek that figured out how to freaking do a radio show in the middle  of Vietnam.  Like a real one.  Do we know his real name now?  No.  No.  We're going to find out more about this guy.  But I guess I didn't even know that I have, like, gold in my possession because I guess  the clips on the internet are really, really bad quality.  Yeah.  So this is, like, gold.  It's hard to get this stuff clear, right?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Supposedly there's more stuff on the internet, but it's really, really bad quality in general. 
[01:09:30]  So we're going to take a break.  We'll play more from this tape.  Old school Opie and Anthony.  You know, another thing I found as I unloaded boxes the other day.  It's Dave Rabbit from 1970, 71, somewhere around there, broadcasting live from Vietnam.  More audio after the break.  Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show, a busy one today, by the way.  We got Locke from Lost coming in in about an hour.  Yes. 
[01:10:00]  What's his name?  Terry.  Terry O'Quinn.  I just know him as Locke.  And I don't even watch the show, but I know that much.  I'm going to watch the show after The Wire.  Can I tell you something?  Yeah.  The Wire devastated me yesterday.  What happened, Jimmy?  No, don't tell me!  I'm not going to spoil it.  It ruined.  I was actually depressed.  Really?  That means someone big died.  That's obvious.  I'm on season one, though, so whatever.  I'll get to the current season sometime in August. 
[01:10:30]  It really, it depressed me.  I'll say this is the beauty of The Wire.  I was so angry at them for doing it, and yet it made the show have much more integrity because they did it.  Really?  It was one of those things, it was like, I so didn't want it to happen.  But it happened.  It was like, God damn it, that is the way it happens.  McNulty?  I'm not going to say anything about any person, anything that happened.  All I'm going to say is I was in an honest depression yesterday.  All right.  Very cool.  I'm definitely digging the show. 
[01:11:00]  Jimmy turned me on to it.  I'm finally, I think I'm halfway through the first season.  Oh, it's great.  Yeah.  I couldn't watch any yesterday, and it killed me.  I wanted to watch so bad.  And then we got, oh, Louis Black coming in in about 15 minutes to talk politics.  Trust me, it's going to be great because Louis Black and Anthony are very similar when it comes to their political views.  Oh, yeah.  You could barely tell us apart.  It's amazing.  I hope he's got his Kevlar on today.  That's not true.  They're very different. 
[01:11:30]  Larry literal mixed appearance.  Larry literal.  Hey, we're continuing with our old school Opie and Anthony bit.  Basically finding a lot of old stuff as I empty boxes in my new apartment there.  And I found this Dave Rabbit tape.  It's not about us today.  It's about this guy, Dave Rabbit.  He did an underground radio show in Vietnam back in 1970, 1971.  That was very, very different than what the government was putting out.  Yeah.  And much better than what the government was putting out.  Oh, sure.  Well, Louis and Cronauer away. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, we all know Vietnam radio from, yeah, of course, good morning, Vietnam.  And I don't feel like really screaming it.  But this guy was doing the complete opposite.  He was tripping and just kind of talking like a real person.  Dirty jokes.  Oh, yeah.  Dirty jokes and all sorts of stuff.  Who, who?  So let's go right back to the tape.  It's Dave Rabbit, 1970, 1971.  And he talks about taking a bathroom break here.  Listen to this.  Cream with white room.  Oh, he was a chatty Cathy, by the way, because he was talking after every song, I noticed. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, boy, would the PD have a field day with this guy.  He was talking well into the song, too.  Oh, I know.  Over the vocals.  He didn't give a crap.  That's why I love this guy.  Breaking all the rules.  Yeah.  Cream with white room.  White.  We're going to let this next one roll on through.  Why?  Well, for one reason, I've got to go take a big, heavy... 
[01:13:00]  Boring, unforeseen incidences that may occur during my trip to the latrine, such as being  picked up from marijuana or stomping in and getting a quick...  ...with one of the whores down the hall.  I'll be back to finish this goddamn program.  I love this guy. 
[01:13:30]  Hilarious.  He got away with more in Vietnam in 1971 than we do now.  Yeah.  But Howard was the first, you know.  Of course you were, Howard.  It's because of shock jock.  Ignore all the people that came before you.  That's great.  Way to know the biz.  Wow.  How great is that?  Like we explained during the last break, the guy was broadcasting a show from the back  of a whorehouse.  So, hence the...  Yeah, getting a beep from one of the whores. 
[01:14:00]  What did he want to get?  A cup of flour?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hello.  Borrow some sugar, please.  Yeah.  Could you put it in your beep?  Let's go to...  Beep.  Never mind.  Let's go to Wes, the trucker.  Wes.  Good morning, bubba boy.  Hey, man.  Hey, I'll make it quick.  Tell me this guy doesn't sound like Space Shuttle Endeavor.  Yeah, a little bit, a little bit.  Endeavor.  A lot of people saying he sounds like Chris Hansen.  Yeah.  Rod Serling.  Who else?  There's a couple others that came in. 
[01:14:30]  Damone?  Damone.  No, it's all about Rod Serling.  Come on.  Let's hear more of this guy.  All right, here we go.  That's all I want to hear.  Well...  Let's cancel Louis Black and cancel Terry O'Quinn and listen to him.  I'll play more tomorrow.  Because tomorrow, I'm saving the good stuff for tomorrow where he's tripping on the air.  Completely tripping on the air and openly admitting it because he has no bosses.  I'd love to know who was able to trip in Vietnam.  Wow.  Yeah, wow.  That would be a creepy trip. 
[01:15:00]  I hear it was very popular.  Oh, well, of course.  Tom just came down the hall and told me I can't mention that because they're not advertising.  This doesn't...  It doesn't make good radio to trip on the air.  That's right.  Are you kidding me?  Someone is tripping on the air and I'm listening every day.  Of course.  Every day.  Here's...  Well, we get to meet Captain Ivan...  Pansy.  Pansy?  And he does the weather for Dave Rabbit.  I haven't listened to this tape, by the way, in easily 10 years.  Time for another weather report on the 22nd attachment of the 30th Weather Squadron with Captain Ivan Pansy. 
[01:15:30]  Oh, my doll.  All right, Captain, you're on the air.  Darling.  My darling Clemens.  Oh.  Thank you, Dave, and good evening, everyone.  This is your midnight cowboy, Captain Ivan Pansy, with tonight's weather.  Stop it, Ralph.  Tonight's weather is kind of screwed up, mainly because I've been kind of hopped up on goofballs and haven't made a report of yet. 
[01:16:00]  Anyway, we'll give it a go and see how badly I can screw it up tonight.  Today's high was 146 degrees in the shade.  Don't know what it was in the sun.  Wasn't stupid enough to go out in it.  Well, tonight's low to get down to 69 degrees.  Hey, 69, it sounds like a well-rounded number.  The sun will rise at 0645 hours for you lifers and 645 a.m. for your first thermos. 
[01:16:30]  It will shed at 1945 hours for the maggots and 745 p.m. for the first thermos.  Well, Dave, that's about the way it looks on the weather scene for the night.  This is your midnight cowboy for the Saigon, the Trang, Panrang area, Captain Ivan Pansy.  Wishing you all a good...  I mean, excuse me, a good evening.  Now, Ralph, now stop it.  Now, how many times have I told you to stop it? 
[01:17:00]  Thank you, Captain Pansy and Ralph.  And Ralph.  Thank you, Captain Pansy and Ralph.  Captain Pansy rules.  They were just having a good old time.  He's not JFK, Captain Pansy.  I think that's what he was going for.  He's doing little bits and characters.  They got a cast.  A cast of characters.  And this was done in 1970?  Yeah, you know.  Don't even friggin' tell me who invented what. 
[01:17:30]  Jesus.  It's always been out there, to be honest with you.  Great stuff.  You got to respect the people that came before you.  I want Captain Pansy.  And acknowledge that they did some stuff before you did.  What?  I want Captain Pansy to do the weather here every day.  Yeah.  Steve?  No, that's general.  He's been promoted.  He sure has.  I've gotten a promotion.  General fruit.  I'm a four-star pansy.  He's got new stripes on his knee pads. 
[01:18:00]  I get gold clusters, but they turned out to be warts.  Let's go to Jason in Carolina.  Jason.  Hey, boys.  I wondered if Dave Rabbit ever cruised around Vietnam in a blimp.  All right.  All right.  That's not nice.  That's right.  We're going to drop these bras on you, mother-huggers.  Yeah.  F-U-A-B-U.  I hate you.  Just in case you're wondering.  Oh, my God. 
[01:18:30]  There's your answer, Jimmy.  Nick in Cleveland, what's up?  Good morning to you.  Hey, ONA.  What's going on?  What's up, Nick?  Hey.  I just want to tell you guys, first time listening to you live in Cleveland, and I'm glad you  guys are back, man.  Thank you, sir.  We've got something specifically to hear you.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  I just want to tell Jimmy that we're coming to see him, House of Blues, second show.  Dude, I can't wait to see you, man.  Thank you very much, man.  Both of those shows are sold out, so I appreciate it.  House of Blues.  House of Blues.  Nice.  We're very excited about being live in Cleveland.  I can't stress that enough, man. 
[01:19:00]  It's been way too long, because, I mean, we've been on tape delay in afternoons, but we  haven't been able to talk to the people in Cleveland for a while.  I've been able to communicate, have the people contribute, call in.  It's nice.  It really is.  We've always had a very good rapport with our Cleveland fans.  Yeah, it's a sick city.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Kevin in Connecticut.  Kevin, what's up?  Hi, guys.  Hey.  I hate to bother you at work.  Yeah.  Can we find this stuff online somewhere?  It's got beeps in it on the radio.  Did you just say, I hate to bother you at work? 
[01:19:30]  Well, first of all, I do have the...  That's a very funny line to tell a radio show.  Yeah.  I do have the uncensored stuff that we're going to play a little bit later on.  A little later, huh?  And I'm starting to learn that I got gold in my hand here.  I don't know if I want to just throw it on the internet.  Maybe it's time to make a buck or two.  Jeez.  No, I'll throw it out there.  We'll figure it out.  Maybe throw a couple clips on onaradio.com later today, because I think Steven S wants 
[01:20:00]  it for the rundown.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  And then we'll put the whole thing that I got.  I only got one show.  I mean, one show.  I got about 30 clips.  That's about it.  Huh?  Good stuff.  Yeah, I think it's great.  Let's go back to it, matter of fact.  See how many lost breaks there are, how many lost air checks, and just things that no one  ever recorded?  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Gone.  Just from my dopey radio career, I'm like, why wasn't I taping?  Well, you think you feel bad.  Do you know some of the original Tonight Shows, the dummies at NBC wanted to save money on 
[01:20:30]  tape, so they just started taping years ago over some of the original Carsons.  There are no copies in existence.  So dumb.  It's just audio.  Oh, there's audio?  Wow.  Why didn't our, like, the people that came before us realize that maybe somebody wants  to listen to this crap someday?  Eventually.  Because then they do that with the Honeymooners, too?  There's a few that they just don't have tapes of or something like that, or they've got  very, very strange versions of it.  Probably some of the originals, maybe from the Jackie Gleason show. 
[01:21:00]  Maybe, yeah.  They were doing sketches.  All right, let's get back to Dave Rabbit, 1970, 71, Underground Radio from Vietnam.  Oh, yeah, this one's, this is good.  Another message from the latrine walls.  His bit.  Cactus, you can't judge a book by looking at his cover.  Here's another quickie from the latrines in the Republic of Vietnam.  This guy writes, fighting for someone else's freedom is like f***ing for someone else's virginity. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, you can't judge a name by looking at the beach.  F***ing power.  What was the, what did he say?  Uh, hold on, I'll show you.  Something power?  Oh, you're writing it down?  Oh, wow, yeah, well, of course.  Yeah.  Uh, basically he said, ha ha!  Power.  Yeah.  But use the, uh, the T word for that.  After I remove the ice pack, I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. 
[01:22:00]  In the shower, I use a water-activated gel cleanser.  Then a honey almond body scrub.  And on the face, an exfoliating gel scrub.  What is that?  Patrick Bateman.  They're picking up on your nail filing, by the way.  Oh, I'm sorry.  They're really freaking out.  How the hell is that?  And caps, they're going, enough.  And you got in there, Abiva?  Enough with the nail filing!  Oh, I'm sorry, guys.  Enough about the filing.  I was just doing it, because I, I don't have, my girlfriend always complains that my nails  shooka, shooka, shooka, shooka, shooka, shooka, shooka. 
[01:22:30]  I apologize, guys.  That's hysterical.  Me and Jimmy are just filing away.  I'm not filing nails, though.  That's, that's kind of.  No, you're filing a scab.  That's healthy.  That's kind of gay.  I'm just filing a scab.  Well, yeah, so I can't pick it anymore.  It's time to, like, make this go away.  How about just you don't pick it?  Yeah, leave it, and it goes away.  How about you go, I'm not going to pick it?  Yeah, that would be wonderful.  I would love to do that.  But obviously, I can't, so now I got to do, I got to go to this stage, where I file  it down so it's so smooth, I can't get at anything, and then it'll go away, hopefully. 
[01:23:00]  I'll put the file down.  My apologies.  I didn't know that was going on over the air.  Had I known, I would have done this.  The rabbit would love you.  Oh, no, rabbit, yeah, he would.  All right, we got two more clips, and then we got to, like, take a break, then we get  Louis Black in here, and all hell's going to break, Louis, I guarantee that.  Oh, we will see.  Okay, we're going to save the rest of the clips for tomorrow, and hopefully we're going  to get Dave Rabbit on our show.  E-Rock's in communications with this guy. 
[01:23:30]  Dave has a complaint right here.  This is so goddamn long, I could have gone downstairs and got a shot of back.  What is that?  And you laughed.  A shot of back?  What is that?  It sounds like he could have gotten one of the whores.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I was wondering if it was a drug reference.  I've never heard shot of back before.  I didn't know what that was.  Could be a drink over there.  Back could be some kind of Vietnamese, like, you know, corn liquor or something. 
[01:24:00]  Who knows?  Yeah.  All right.  I don't know.  I instantly thought it was sexual.  Yeah.  Well, it might be.  He was complaining because the song was way too long.  Because, you know, this guy liked to talk.  Oh, this was in the middle of the song?  The song was still going.  It was like six minutes in, and then he just comes on and says how annoyed he is.  That's crazy.  I love this.  You sure this guy isn't related to me?  He just seems annoyed at everything.  This **** is so goddamn long, I could have gone downstairs and got a shot of back. 
[01:24:30]  A shot of back.  Wrestling on with more music.  Iron butterfly.  Wow.  Soul experience.  Speed kills.  Slow down.  Be your friend.  Never left home.  Smoke grass.  Smoke grass. 
[01:25:00]  I love this.  Just babbling into the mic.  And don't ruin it for me and show me a current day picture of this guy.  I just want him.  Oh, I got an image.  Really?  He's hardcore.  You think?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  If anything happened, he could pick up a rifle and take care of business.  He's living in the woods somewhere.  Yeah.  I saw him already.  And?  No, huh?  Don't ruin it for me.  I won't.  Dr. Steve.  I won't.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy. 
[01:25:30]  I'm not going to ruin it for you.  He looks like anyone's father.  Dr. Steve.  Oh, boy.  Dr. Steve looks like an intellectual.  Yeah, he is.  He's a doctor.  Yes.  They're known to be bright.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It looks like he graduated high school.  Well, are you ready for the next one?  Yes.  Yeah.  Iron butterfly.  Soul experience.  Lifers are like flies.  They both eat s**t and bother people.  I know. 
[01:26:00]  So subtle, man.  That's a great delivery.  They both eat s**t and bother people.  Wow.  They both eat s**t and bother people.  That is hilarious.  That is good.  Lifers.  Iron butterfly.  Soul experience.  Lifers are like flies.  They both eat s**t and bother people.  And bother people.  Thank you, Pete.  Did you hear that?  What was that?  Pete in the background going, right on. 
[01:26:30]  Thank you, Pete.  Do you like Huey Lewis and the News?  This is off of sports.  All right.  You know what?  We got to play a couple more.  Of course we do.  We got a lot more, but we'll at least play the tripping on air.  This is him tripping on air.  Are people liking this?  I hope they are.  All right, man.  This guy's.  I think they are.  What's the feedback saying?  Yeah.  They're digging this.  It's different. 
[01:27:00]  It's cool.  It's like we're the history channel today.  Yeah.  Well, it's part of our old school O.P. and Anthony.  Yeah.  Just stuff I've been finding.  I love this guy.  Unload boxes of crap.  Yee-haw!  Yee-haw!  Reba!  Reba!  Woo!  Oh, that's obviously him.  He's just.  What is that?  Funk 69 or something like that?  Funk 49?  69.  James Gang, right?  He's just messing around with James Gang. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  Dave Rabbit, 1970.  Yee-haw!  Yee-haw!  Yee-haw!  Reba!  Reba!  Deez!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Fuck number 69.  James Gang.  Sorry about that yelling and screaming, but Pete and I are on a trip, and we thought we'd have to get in on that song. 
[01:28:00]  Here's one done by the Biggie, Three Dog Night.  It's called Mama Told Me Not to C***.  Now, you can take this two ways.  As a title, or your girlfriend's name is Mama.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, that's great.  You ever hear this song? 
[01:28:30]  Wait, can you play that?  They probably didn't have to beep that out, but just trying to keep it safe.  Can you play that again?  Is it possible?  Yeah, yeah, sure.  You know the Three Dog Nights song?  No, let me hear it.  Let me see if I can figure it out.  I don't know it.  Okay.  I'm not going to look at the board.  Mama Told Me Not to...  I have to play it again.  I didn't...  Yee-haw!  Yee-haw!  Rebound!  Rebound!  Get it!  Ah!  Ah! 
[01:29:00]  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Fuck number 69, James Gang.  Sorry about that yelling and screaming, but Pete and I are on a trip, and we thought we'd  have to get in on that song.  Here's one done by the Biggie Three Dog Night.  It's called Mama Told Me Not to... 
[01:29:30]  Now, you can take this two ways.  As a title, or your girlfriend's name is Mama.  Cross the whiskey!  I figured it out.  Yes.  Yeah.  It's a very famous song, by the way, so I think most people figured it out.  Yeah.  You know.  What a funny joke.  One more.  We'll do the...  That's great.  We'll do the PSA, and then we'll leave it...  Clever.  ...leave it here, and then we'll do more Dave Rabbit tomorrow, Underground Radio from 
[01:30:00]  Vietnam, 1970, and hopefully get him on the show tomorrow.  Uh...  It's like the Ron Bennington of Southeast Asia.  Yeah.  He's always got a line.  Yeah, exactly.  Charlie don't surf.  The fez.  Hey, fez.  People are confused by all the cursing, but this was Underground, man.  You can do whatever the hell you want.  Uh...  Okay, here we go.  The last one for today.  We got more for tomorrow.  Don't worry.  It's a long little grass now.  Going back into music by Steppenwolf called The Pusher. 
[01:30:30]  Speaking of The Pusher, brothers and sisters, if you happen to be down by the Magic Finger  Lounge any time tonight, keep away from the Korean at the front door.  Remember, he's pushing some bad H. I repeat, he's pushing some bad H.  Wow.  Oh, wow.  That's helpful.  Yeah.  That's good knowledge right there.  He got his ass handed to him.  Huh? 
[01:31:00]  I bet he got his ass handed to him.  Yeah, thank you.  Guy at the door.  Oh, yeah.  All right, we'll have more tomorrow, but we'll leave it at that.  How cool is that?  Is that cool?  Amazing.  Very cool.  Yeah.  Guy's got a great delivery.  We gave some of the background info on him earlier.  I'm trying to listen to my new Robert Palmer tape.  Yeah.  Su-su-sudio.  This is Su-sudio.  Yeah. 
[01:31:30]  Some say it's Phil Collins' best work.  No one beats Patrick Bateman.  I didn't like the spoken word.  The book is one of my...  I've read the book three times.  I know, like, the book is...  Have you read it?  It's different than...  No.  It's much more graphic.  I never saw the whole film.  That's what I hear.  Oh.  But I just love Christian Bale as that psychopath.  He's hysterical.  The way he delivers his lines.  I'm confused.  Yeah.  All right, we've got to take a break.  Lewis Black here? 
[01:32:00]  Not yet.  All right.  Hopefully, Lewis Black will be here when we come back from break.  Yeah.  And as we go to break, we've got today's honoree for Black History Month.  A good one.  In honor of Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony Show is honoring black heroes, African-American  individuals throughout history, without whom this country would not be the melting pot.  It is today.  Today, we honor Clarence Gillyard, Jr., who played Theo in the 1988 John McTiernan film Die Hard.  Oh, my God, the quarterback is toast. 
[01:32:30]  Stay tuned for more icons of black history on the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Lewis Black in studio.  And we're very, very happy about that.  Yes, Jimmy.  Before I forget, this Friday night coming February 22nd, I will be at The Egg in Albany for tickets.  518-473-1845.  It's a different hour than the HBO hour, so come out if you're in Albany, The Egg this 
[01:33:00]  Friday night.  I think I'm supposed to promote some stuff, too, here.  The Egg for me?  The Egg for Jim Norton.  I've got to remind people they got a chance to win $2,000.  I hope people know about this contest by now.  We're doing an original animated bit contest.  So basically, you take a bit from our show.  I think we have a bunch of them up on onaradio.com.  You choose one of those, you animate it, and the best animation is going to win $2,000.  How cool is that?  You go to onaradio.com for all the details. 
[01:33:30]  It's courtesy of Be Kind Rewind, starring Jack Black.  You name it, we shoot it in theaters Friday.  Friday.  What's up, Lewis?  That was smooth, right?  That was really good.  Lewis Black.  You can either do the cartoon or rob a 7-Eleven.  Whatever works.  Whichever works.  Come on.  Might be easier to rob the 7-Eleven.  Some people are a little better at animation.  Some people are better at scaring people.  Yeah, sure.  All depends on your color. 
[01:34:00]  We haven't seen Lewis in a while since our fine comedy tour.  Remember when we exchanged numbers while we were drinking wine at 3 in the morning,  signing autographs that went for days?  Weeks set in.  And you said, we'll do sushi soon.  But that was five months ago, Lewis.  And now here we are.  And now here we are is right.  But, Lewis, always love having you on when something's going on like this ridiculous election.  It's pretty good, huh?  It's fun to watch.  A lot of people, have you noticed a lot of people getting into it? 
[01:34:30]  Kind of really concentrating on the candidates and what's happening.  I haven't seen this in a while, you know?  Well, you know, we actually haven't had an election in a while.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That'll kind of do it.  Well, you know, the other reason they're doing it is because nobody's paying attention to him.  When did we have a president who for eight years just said, well, what do you think?  You know, I don't really care what you think.  Yeah.  You got an opinion?  I don't care what your opinion is.  I am right.  You're wrong.  Screw you. 
[01:35:00]  So, anybody shows up who looks like they might listen for five minutes, people are going to pay attention.  Yeah.  Well, that's obvious.  But this, I've called this Obama thing the cult of personality because a lot of people are saying they're voting for him.  But a lot of people have no idea what he stands for.  Well, it's perfect after this president, isn't it?  Wouldn't you want to not know what they stand for?  You knew what the other guy stood for, and you didn't even get what he stood for. 
[01:35:30]  In the end, you didn't get what he said he stood for in the first place.  So, why not take somebody who's got nothing?  What I hate is hope.  Don't give me hope.  What do I want hope for?  What do I need that for?  I am miserable now after the last eight years.  You know what I want?  I want somebody to say, I'll get you some sherbet.  We'll put you in a hospital for ten minutes.  I don't need hope. 
[01:36:00]  No?  No, it's like vertigo.  You can't go from zero to hope.  You've got to take baby steps.  You've got to say, okay, maybe we'll do something tomorrow.  Maybe.  Maybe it's better than hope.  That should be his campaign slogan.  Maybe it's better than hope.  They sure are.  They're pushing the hope thing.  They're saying that it's time for a change.  That's Obama's big thing is change, change, change. 
[01:36:30]  But it's everybody's.  Everybody's saying it.  Well, they're all saying it.  Even McCain.  But Obama's got the big sign that he stands back of or whatever.  Well, yeah, well, change means it's.  Well, you keep thinking of it in terms of change.  It's how many.  It's change.  Like in.  Will we get quarters for a dollar or nickels?  Change.  Oh.  They've said it so much.  It just means it changed.  It just means change.  Oh, I thought it was going to change things in Washington.  No, it'll be different types of change. 
[01:37:00]  Business as usual.  Sometimes you'll get 50 pennies and 50 cents.  Two quarters and 50.  Is that the economic stimulus plan?  Some change?  Did you like that plan?  What a plan that is.  Those two parties get together.  Let's give everybody a cupcake a day.  What fruits?  600 bucks.  You're nuts.  You're going to give us a couple hundred bucks.  We spend it.  It trickles down.  Yeah, it trickles down to where?  What, they're going to be racing to Walmart?  Oh, boy, I can get that cheese grater now.  We can make fondue. 
[01:37:30]  You don't think they're spending the money?  Oh, yeah.  The rich, why don't the rich at this point just, you know, lock up in the gated communities  and start shooting at us?  Of course, I'm doing pretty well.  Yeah, I think you'd be in there with fire on the guns.  No, I don't care.  I'm going in.  You know, I've got a difference of opinion about that.  Well, you don't like, do you like Obama?  Like, what's not to like?  Anything is better.  Well.  Anything except, anything is better.  Are you nuts? 
[01:38:00]  Is that good, anything is better?  Well, that's where we're at.  What do you want?  What did you think?  Leadership was going to arise out of a sewer?  I thought maybe McCain.  Oh, for Christ.  You've got to be kidding me.  I think maybe McCain is a little more liberal than these conservative Republicans like Bush.  And perhaps he'll be able to reach both sides.  I think Obama is a little too much on the socialist side for me. 
[01:38:30]  You don't even know what he wants to do.  I've listened a little bit.  I know what he wants.  You just said it yourself.  You can't have the argument too well.  I said most people.  I'm different.  I study these people.  And I know that there's going to be a lot of democratic, liberal tax and spend.  He's coming up with all these programs he wants.  Where's that money coming from?  Me.  Wait a second.  Me.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Yeah.  Have you been just oblivious to the last eight years that they were just like taking money? 
[01:39:00]  Oh, yeah.  That they didn't do it.  That this was not a tax.  This was we're not taxing.  We're just spending.  So now we've got nothing, schmuck.  We've got nothing.  We basically, they own us.  The world owns us.  So you're going to have to, how do we get out of taxes?  But how do you want to do that?  You don't want to tax the oil companies?  But I like the way Bush kind of put in tax breaks.  What?  Or the upper echelon. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, because, oh boy, what did we need?  What, an extra pair of long underwear?  What did you get out of it?  In the end, you're still wearing the same schmucky cap and t-shirt.  But under Obama, I see a lot of taxes going to health care.  This wacky universal health care thing is just, it can't work.  We cannot give every man, woman, and child in this country free health care. 
[01:40:00]  It just doesn't work.  Oh, yeah, you can.  How is that?  You do it by going to the drug companies, and you have people with guns, and they go,  guess what?  It doesn't cost that much, you pig.  All right?  I like how Lewis thinks right there.  I agree to Lewis.  You're some of your solutions.  You've got to cut to the chase.  We need a revolution, right?  It doesn't cost that much, you pig.  That should be Obama's slogan right there. 
[01:40:30]  Screw the change sign.  But I don't know why I end up defending it, because I'm not a big defender of Obama or Hillary.  Well, you like Hillary.  It's obvious.  Oh, yeah, boy.  Oh, yeah.  Lewis is a big Hillary fan.  That's right.  They have the same haircut.  Well, wouldn't it be fun to have Bill Clinton as the first lady?  It would be interesting, wouldn't it?  That would be hilarious.  He keeps looking for, you know, it's like he can't get enough time.  Oh, I know.  He is in front of the cameras just yelling at people. 
[01:41:00]  He likes getting into arguments now with people.  He wants her in the White House so he can start fooling around again.  It's kind of like that big CEO guy that's on all these business trips.  He's paying whatever he wants, but then he has to retire and go home to his wife.  Now he has to make up excuses to leave the house.  He can't come up with the excuses.  But if Hillary's in the White House now, now he's back to doing some of that, you know?  Now, Lewis, so you don't like the candidates that are out there, the frontrunners.  So which communist is running that you're going to be voting for? 
[01:41:30]  They don't think they're, you know, there's nobody around.  I mean, just as long as it wasn't that Huckabee thing.  That's where I get scared.  You get scared the other way.  I get scared.  Huckabee, what is that?  And the worst was that when I said it's reached rock bottom, because to me it's really rock bottom, was Fred Thompson.  Oh, yeah.  I said I watched him seven minutes on, this is when I felt we'd just lost it, that somebody somewhere said, hey, you ought to run.  Why don't you run? 
[01:42:00]  You know, and he was on Meet the Press for seven minutes.  And I thought, really, I would just rather watch this guy eat oatmeal.  And say anything aloud.  I don't know who.  I don't know who.  And then you're going to see who their vice presidents are?  I think it would be fun to be alive when the first black president is in office.  Do you?  Yeah.  Just see what happens.  How about, who do you think?  Why do you care at this point?  I'm just unbelievable. 
[01:42:30]  You act as if we've been through the renaissance.  Well, all I'm saying, Anthony's convinced everything will completely change if we get a break.  No, no, no, not completely change.  But here's where I'm going with this.  Because he's a black president, he would feel pressure from his constituency to give a little more favor to black people in the United States.  And because white politicians are so guilt-ridden, they will sign off on a lot more stuff than they would with stupid old guy, old white guy in there, where they're always arguing and a Republican will never sign off on a Democrat's plan and vice versa. 
[01:43:00]  But Obama is one of these that can unite both parties, but in a way where it's really not going to benefit me.  Wow.  Can I say one thing, Anthony, you're right about with the taxes?  I just got a check.  I did something for Kevin Smith's movie. 
[01:43:30]  I'll tell you how much I made.  It was a one-day thing.  It was $2,200.  Sweet.  A tremendous amount of money.  That's nice.  For the lack of work I did.  But it's like a union thing.  I got my check.  I must have filled out the taxes where they just gave it to me, my Social Security, $1,300.  They took $900 out of that money.  Oh, my God.  $900 out of $2,200 went to the government.  It's like, and the Democrats didn't make that worse?  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  You bought a lug nut for a Humvee.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  You have a, you're a... 
[01:44:00]  Incorporated, but I'm an ass and didn't fill it out with my incorporation.  But whatever.  I just said, like, most people have to make that kind of money.  But, you know, all right, look, the only reason that I have no trouble with the tax  thing is if, and this is where this, if you're going to go to war, you have to pay for it.  We've been at this, whatever.  They don't even call it a war.  Where do you think the money's going to come from?  What are we going to do?  That's where the money goes.  I mean, they say it doesn't go there, but in the end, that, you know, that's to me 
[01:44:30]  from the very beginning when they didn't say it.  Okay, here's the deal.  Here's this war that's costing billions of dollars a week.  It's AF a trillion now.  Billion, yeah, yeah.  Now, the war stops, let's say, hopefully, soon.  All that money now is just surplus that can replace the money we've spent and build up  without having to pay any extra taxes.  Is that what happens?  Where does this money come from?  You know what I really love is the four of us who economically know nothing. 
[01:45:00]  Discussing economics.  Yeah, but we're experts because we have microphones.  But you're right about it.  When you get that check, it's a whack.  I mean, I don't mind them taking their share.  I'm fine with paying my share.  But $900, I almost threw up.  I'm like, what are they doing with my...  I did, I heard it.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we heard you throwing.  You want to hear Jimmy throwing up there, Lewis?  Oh, Lewis, you've got to hear this.  Jimmy had the...  Why not?  It was a very wise decision when they asked him, would you like the fish on an airplane? 
[01:45:30]  No.  Yeah, I had the fish.  And he ate the fish.  It was good.  That's great.  Delicious.  Cream sauce, too.  Yeah, with cream sauce.  I should have just opened my mouth and let the flight attendant jam her fingers down  my throat.  Not a wise choice.  On a plane.  With the cream sauce.  But Jimmy is...  Not grilled.  He's such a trooper that he knew it would make something good for the show, so he recorded  it.  That's spectacular.  On a camera.  I have a camera.  I'll show you.  As he feels like crap. 
[01:46:00]  Would you like to hear it?  I want to hear it.  Oh, man.  That's a bad one, isn't it?  Wow.  Wow.  Whoa.  Oh, my God.  Oh.  Oh, man.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  But it didn't happen while you were on the plane. 
[01:46:30]  No, no.  That was in the hotel on Valentine's Day.  Valentine's Day.  My girlfriend laid in bed in the lingerie, hoping for something that was never happening.  What?  You didn't look good in the lingerie?  Oh, God.  Yeah, I just...  I saw her once in the lingerie.  I had to rent the bathroom.  No offense.  So who are you going to vote for?  Would you vote for Hillary or Brock?  They'd vote for one.  We can discuss it over this.  Yeah, that's good.  It's perfect.  It's a perfect backdrop.  I don't...  I'm serious.  I feel my...  Go ahead, Moist.  Answer the question.  Will you answer the question? 
[01:47:00]  Stop being evasive.  Let's go.  Who are you going to vote for?  No, my feeling is that...  Let's go.  Bump.  Yep.  I've been around these...  All of them have been running for so long.  Yeah.  Wow.  Wow.  It wasn't good.  No kidding.  Answer the question.  Yeah, Lewis.  Stop stalling.  Yeah, right.  No, I just feel like they've all been president, and I'm ready to move on. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I really have heard everything that they want to do.  What I find most...  All right.  All right.  Go ahead.  That's unbelievable.  How long did that go on?  A while.  Wow.  And that wasn't the sitting portion.  That was the...  Yeah, the sitting portion.  The sitting portion was the matinee, and that was the appetizer right there.  No, I just...  I'm just amazed that we don't have better choices, Lewis.  Well, it's...  Out of all the people that could possibly run for the presidency, you get this. 
[01:48:00]  What's amazing is to have a leadership void for, and let's say, let's just give them the  benefit of the doubt.  Let's say two years.  Let's say since Katrina.  Since you didn't know how to deal with a catastrophe.  Right.  That no one that really came out of either party, and let's say certainly the Democrats first,  who could come up and go and take the lead. 
[01:48:30]  Because there really shouldn't...  We shouldn't be at a point of trying to figure out who the next one is, if it was going to  be a Democrat.  It should be someone who have grabbed everybody's attention by going, this is nuts.  Right, right.  You know, who did the job?  None of them did.  None of them did.  You know, they're all...  It's...  It's...  It's so sad.  Do you want to hear something else before we go to break?  What is this?  Well, it's all about pop culture during this election, and you get, like, little goofy  songs and stuff.  Oh, oh, I love this one.  You love Hillary, right? 
[01:49:00]  Shut up.  I just adore her.  One, two, three, four, five, six, two thousand, beat Wisconsin, Ohio, Texas, and on to Penn  State.  She's going to do it.  Give her just a chance, she'll make it.  Any glass ceiling, she'll break it.  She's going to be our president.  Hillary Clinton.  Uh-uh.  That's good.  I want to turn her back now.  Straight ahead and on to check out. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, yeah.  With plans to make our dreams come true.  Wow.  Dreams come true.  Hillary Clinton.  We don't have to do the whole thing for you.  Hillary's very in touch with what the young people are listening to and doing.  Yeah.  It's good.  She's got the kids wrapped around her finger.  All right.  We got to take a break.  From a 30-year-old sitcom.  That's wonderful.  We got Terry O'Quinn, who's a big fan of yours, Lewis.  That really makes me very jealous.  Outside the studio.  He's like, Lewis is here.  He freaked out.  He doesn't actually remember when we were both doing theater, which means just a little 
[01:50:00]  left to gay.  When we were both doing theater, I met him actually.  He used to work in Baltimore at a theater down there that my friends used to work at.  Wow.  Yeah.  You didn't act with him.  Did you act with him?  No.  No.  They didn't allow me to act then.  You know who you acted with?  Me.  Yes.  In a B-movie.  That's who you acted with.  That was a good movie.  That's a great movie.  Which one?  Side Splinters.  Yeah, I love Side Splinters.  That's a good movie.  I think it's hilarious.  I'm just saying that the caliber vector. 
[01:50:30]  All right, listen.  We got to take a break so we get Terry O'Neill in here.  Terry O'Quinn.  Ryan O'Neill.  Ryan O'Neill.  Ryan O'Neill hits the kids.  Terry O'Quinn.  Of course, Terry O'Quinn.  Locke.  Locke from Lost.  Of course.  Locke hits everyone else.  Yeah.  He really has turned into a son of a bitch, hasn't he?  Oh, my God.  He's brutal.  I love it.  I just got to remind people, we're hosting a private semi-pro screening.  This coming Tuesday?  Yes.  This Tuesday at the AMC Empire. 
[01:51:00]  Where's that?  234 West 42nd Street in Manhattan at 11 a.m. right after our radio show.  The first 75 people will get to attend the screening and get a free corn dog.  Wow.  And then you can actually do the tape.  That's really cool.  Corn dog.  You got to be kidding.  All the hot giveaways.  They didn't really.  Somebody handed you copy.  And then you wonder why there's no leadership.  And get a free corn dog.  Get a free corn dog.  Well, that's it.  That's close.  First come, first serve.  Semi-pro starring Will Ferrell. 
[01:51:30]  With a corn dog.  Putting the funk into the dunk.  I like that first come, first serve, which means somebody will get there and go, what  do you mean there's none left?  Well, sir, you should have gotten here earlier for your free corn dog.  That's right.  I hope it's all homeless people online just wanting a free corn dog and booing the movie.  Semi-pro is in theaters, what, a week from Friday.  How many sports movies has he done?  It's a lot.  He parodies a lot.  3,000. 
[01:52:00]  It's a lot of sports.  I mean, at some point, doesn't it run out of...  I know.  Yeah.  Speaking of movies, we've got an Oscar moment as we go to break.  More with Louis Black.  And, of course, Terry O'Quinn.  Yes.  Terry O'Quinn.  Yeah.  Lock from Lost after the break.  The O.P. and Anthony Show presents Oscar Moments.  Memorable scenes from Academy Award-nominated films.  Today's Oscar moment comes from the film There Will Be Blood, presented by Rich Voss and Bob Kelly.  Say it.  Say it.  I have abandoned my child. 
[01:52:30]  Say it louder.  Say it louder.  I have abandoned my child.  I have abandoned my child.  I have abandoned my boy.  Help pay for the blood.  Just give me the blood, Eli.  Let me get out of here.  Give me the blood, Lord.  And let me get away.  Stay tuned for more Oscar Moments, presented by The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Very busy morning. 
[01:53:00]  We got Louis Black in studio, talking politics.  And now we got to welcome Terry O'Quinn to the program.  Of course, Locke from Lost.  Absolutely.  Is that a mic on?  I'm a...  Could be on.  Get that mic on.  God damn it.  Nothing?  One, two, three.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You just got to...  There you go.  You just got to eat the mic a little bit.  Oh, geez, okay.  There you go.  He's self-spoken.  Yeah.  Well, turn him up a little bit.  I got crucified with the last lost guest or star that was on as a guest on this program, 
[01:53:30]  saying that I was fanboy.  I monopolized the conversation.  Who said that?  All my pals here in the studio.  But not Michael Emerson.  Yeah.  No, it was Michael Emerson.  Yeah, but he wouldn't say that.  He appreciated it.  I had to do it the night before last, and he did say that, actually.  He did.  Yeah.  See?  Damn it.  Look, see?  What a nice picture.  Is it going to be tough talking to those guys?  And he said, well, you don't really have to talk at all.  No. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, is that bad?  Sometimes we get big stars in here, and we could care less.  But with the lost people, Anthony is just a big-time fanboy.  It's me, and Than and Travis are giant fans.  Jimmy's getting into it, which is a pain in the ass.  See, you don't have to talk.  Which is a pain in the ass, because you can't talk to people that are backed up a little bit.  Right.  Because the characters and things change so much and so often that you really can't talk to them. 
[01:54:30]  Like, we couldn't even talk about the character, Ben, because he wasn't up to that spot yet.  He was still the guy in the balloon.  Right.  With his wife.  Yeah, you sort of have an obligation to catch up.  Oh, I do.  I just go home after this show, and I just sit there with a box set.  You don't know how fast I've gone through seasons one and two, but I don't want to rush it and not enjoy it.  Enjoy it, yeah.  But that is the problem with box sets.  You start rushing, you know, viewings.  You want to slow down a little bit and take it in a little bit. 
[01:55:00]  I'm sitting there with my wife, and we shot this season so long ago now because of the strike.  I don't even remember what we shot.  So we're talking, we're watching the show, and if somebody coughs and someone's mouth is moving on the screen, you've got to go back.  Because that's what they say.  They might have said somebody's name or some piece of information.  Do you, as one of the stars of this show, because every time I think I figure out what they're doing, I realize I have no idea what they're doing.  So it's like, do you really know exactly what's going on, or do you just kind of learn week to week with the script like the rest of us? 
[01:55:30]  No, week to week.  Well, yeah.  I mean, I know what we shot.  That's all I know.  I don't even know what the next script that we're going to go shoot when we start shooting again.  In March, we're going back to work.  I don't know what that script, what that holds in store.  So you don't know the ultimate reveal.  Whatever the ultimate reveal is, you don't know.  I've got no idea.  I'm assuming somebody knows.  I mean, I certainly hope they do at this point.  Yeah, they're kind of awkward at the end.  Yeah.  We all just want a flight home.  We don't know.  We have 40 episodes left to shoot.  You're hoping they know where this is going.  I think, you know, I'm thinking, because I think these first three in this season were pretty strong. 
[01:56:00]  So I think it's like the old horse that smells a barn.  You know, they're perking up a little bit.  And you guys are going back to Hawaii in March now.  Does Hawaii get boring after a while?  Yeah.  Well, you know, Hawaii's the best place I've ever worked.  But do they set you up nice, like a condo or something?  Or are you living at a hotel?  No, no.  They give you a pittance to relocate.  You know, the contracts they have for TV now, they give you a relocation fee.  And after that, you're on your own getting to work and getting home and going wherever  you go.  Oh, no kidding. 
[01:56:30]  And you're digging.  So if you want to spend some good money, you can live large in Hawaii?  Sure.  We bought a house there.  I mean, I figured out, you know, I was optimistic.  Couldn't wait until everything got as expensive as it could possibly get, and I bought a house.  Did you expect the show to take off like it did?  No.  I didn't.  I didn't buy a house in the first season.  Yeah.  No, I waited.  You know, I don't.  You've been doing it as long as me.  You don't expect.  You expect the worst.  You hope for the best.  Yeah, I was looking at your resume.  You've been in a lot of stuff.  Is this the most successful show you've done? 
[01:57:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Easily.  Because for years, you were, hey, it's that guy.  You know, I've seen this guy.  I know him.  Yeah, you shop at Home Depot.  Sometimes he's got a mustache.  Like J.T. Walsh.  You know the face for many years, but a lot of people didn't know the name.  It always had one role.  Or Frank Vincent.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, it isn't about most successful.  I've been in shows that were more successful.  This was the first time that I got paid for it.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, you did theater.  Yeah.  And there's nothing more successful than theater.  Well, there you go.  You know, they roll in every night, all 180 of them. 
[01:57:30]  I can't wait to see Shakespeare's dog.  Making fans 180 at a time.  Wow.  That's right.  Those three ladies of the club that have the same blinking lapel pins.  And you're mesmerized as you're going through O'Neal and sliding down somebody's sweaty  arm.  It would take 100 years of theater to make the same audience of one episode of Lost,  basically.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:58:00]  You know, that's the thing about Lost is, you know, many people watch an episode of  Lost is watch a big Oscar-nominated motion picture in its lifetime.  And that happens on one night.  So that's pretty amazing.  That's what I was saying was so great about the show is it comes off like a major motion  picture, which is, you don't get that a lot, especially with an ensemble cast.  You never get as much into the personalities as you have with Lost.  You know, that's one thing I think it's going to be hard to tie all this up because you really 
[01:58:30]  kind of care about all the characters.  There's not as many peripheral characters and then the, you know, just focal point on  a couple of people.  Yeah.  I don't think they're going to be able to satisfy everybody.  No.  But one of the things that's attractive about the show is we didn't know who any of these  people were.  I mean, people didn't know who I was and they didn't know who Michael Emerson was and  they might have seen us before.  But to me, having a big star in any particular role is always a distraction I have to get 
[01:59:00]  past.  You know, if I'm going to enjoy a movie or a television show, it's something I have to  get past.  And so when I tell my wife that, she says, well, you've managed to avoid that.  You've been really successful.  Are you telling me people don't recognize you as Chuck McBride from Remington Steel?  You could say characters' names to me and I go, I didn't know that I was him.  No, you did not.  You were this person on The X-Files.  I didn't know what his name was.  I'll go with Goldberg.  Yeah.  Oh, the movie. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah, yeah.  You got blown up pretty good in The X-Files movie.  It was a good influence and a good exit.  Yeah, absolutely.  Has anything happened to your character?  Like, because they do so many different changes and there's so many shots to the passes.  Is there anything that happened with your character in the show that you didn't like  at first or that you're like, oh, I wish they didn't do that, but then wound up working?  I didn't.  No.  No.  No.  I think they're amazing writers.  So at the end of last season, I can't.  You have to, like, I don't want to ruin this for you.  Okay, no.  That's okay.  Go ahead.  You can just say it.  I threw a knife into a woman's back and I called him and I beefed about that. 
[02:00:00]  I said, that's kind of crazy.  That's a little bit of a character, a little radical.  And they said, well, he does it.  And I said, well, I don't mind the fact that I do that, but then I can't even, like, shoot  the guy, Jack, in the knee.  I said, what's that?  That's just puss.  Yeah, yeah.  You should be able to, you know, carry through on it.  And I like how they've shown you do that, like, previously on Lost.  And there you are, fwok, with that knife.  They can't get enough of showing you with that knife. 
[02:00:30]  I know.  I said, that seems a little gratuitous.  Give me something with a knife.  That's okay.  Yeah.  Was it a bris?  A bris?  No.  Aside from a bris.  Aside from Ben, I think Locke is one of the more mysterious characters on the show.  Right from the beginning.  I mean, finding out.  I think your character was one of the most interesting in finding out where you came from  in the flashbacks.  He has the best backstory. 
[02:01:00]  Absolutely.  I think it's over now, but that was a great run.  It was a really nice contrast between him before and him now.  Yeah.  Just such a beaten down, kind of bitter guy with never having to buy a Father's Day card,  I'll tell you that much.  That dude with really bad hair.  Absolutely.  Trying to get a phone sex operator to go on vacation.  You ruled.  Come on, you've been there.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:01:30]  Of course I have.  Wow.  He had no doubt.  I think your character, more than anybody else's character, has gone through different  changes.  And there's times where I like you, and there's times where I'm like, ugh, he's really  irritating me.  Like, you're doing these things that Locke does.  I'm like, I don't like what he's doing right now.  Where everybody else has remained, I kind of like that.  You've changed a lot.  And then you come back, and I'm like, oh, okay, it was for a good reason that he was doing  that.  He wasn't just being a creep.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, hopefully it'll keep on going that way.  I mean, he's in one of those stages right now where he's a little  freaked out.  Well, what happened was, that you don't know about, he's got to be like, earmuffs, 
[02:02:00]  earmuffs, earmuffs.  Something or somebody pulled him out of this hole.  He got shot through the middle by Ben, and he was laying in a hole full of bones, and  somebody saved him.  Some voice, a person on this island saved him.  So now he's got religion, which, as we all know, makes people crazy.  A little crazy.  He's got religion, and he's really dangerous now.  Yeah.  A little religion goes along with that.  You've done that back and forth over the course of the show, where you kind of do things  and go, yeah, what is he doing?  You tend to divide up the group a lot. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah.  You know, some people want to follow you.  He's a fairly divisive character, yeah.  And I loved the Colonel Kurtz reference that was made to you.  He's got all the good books.  That was a great line.  It's like, all right, Colonel Kurtz.  Colonel Kurtz, yeah.  That went right by a lot of people, but they do.  These guys are so, they're really smart.  Yeah.  They're really smart.  You know, these are the guys who were in high school, and they were the ones that, you  know, people locked in the lockers in gym class, you know, and calling all the shots  now, and they know everything.  And when I do complain, on the few occasions that I have complained, you know, basically 
[02:03:00]  they say, you know, you got the check, right?  Yeah.  I got the check.  All right.  Say the lines.  Yeah.  If they listened to the actors, it would be, we'd be off the air.  It'd be boring.  Boring as hell.  It really is one of the best written shows I've ever seen.  And I didn't want to like it, because I'm, you know, I always think I'm like this stupid  maverick.  Like, I won't like what everybody else likes.  And the first episode I watched, I got hooked on it.  Don't you hate that?  Oh, I'm such an ass.  It was brilliantly written.  You don't admit to watching American Idol or Dancing with the Stars.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I admit to Dancing with the Stars.  I mean, the chicks are so hot on that show. 
[02:03:30]  How can you not watch that show?  I met that little blonde-haired girl at the Kentucky Derby.  Did you?  One last couple of years, God, she's remarkable.  What would you do to her?  What would you do to her?  Put her in a wheelchair.  Lock her in some underground bunker.  No.  And she's a Mormon, which gives it another twist, you know?  Another sick twist.  That's perfect.  I think Belladonna was a Mormon.  You know who Belladonna is?  A porn star?  No.  No.  No.  She doesn't seem very Mormon-ish. 
[02:04:00]  You have a great recognition factor.  I mean, and I assume that's been since Lost started.  I mean, you've been in a lot of stuff before that, but Lost is huge, and you're very recognizable  walking around like that.  Has that annoyed the crap out of you?  No.  No.  Are you kidding?  Not yet?  No.  No.  Wonderful.  That's what you've been working towards?  I've been doing this forever.  You know, people used to go, hey, hey, hey.  Yeah.  It's like, I know you from somewhere. 
[02:04:30]  And then finally, when this show started, they said, Locke, John Locke, you know?  Not your real name.  And then in the last season, last year or so, people actually say, are you Terry O'Quinn?  And I go, ah, I'm there now.  Did it.  You made it.  Well, they say, are you Terry O'Neill?  And I say, no.  You're close.  It's getting closer.  All right.  So you can get any restaurant you walk to.  There's probably no place in the country you can go.  I mean, every airport you walk through, there's nobody that's not going to recognize you.  Well, there's plenty of people. 
[02:05:00]  I mean, there's a lot of people who do, but it's not.  It's at a nice level where people come up to me singly or, you know, couples do.  And, you know, we take a photo.  We chat.  It's very pleasant, you know.  But what's amazing to me, I was in Europe this summer for the first time since this started.  And there were more people who knew us.  I was walking around with Jorge Garcia.  We were up in Canada.  You can't walk around with Jorge Garcia.  Who plays early.  If they don't recognize you, they know him.  But more people in Ireland knew me than, recognized me than anywhere I've been around here. 
[02:05:30]  Wow.  It was amazing.  Bought a lot of drinks.  I had to stay out of the pubs finally.  I had to stay out of the pubs.  There's no Guinness on the island.  At what point was an actor did you realize, like you said, was it by season three or was it somewhere through season one where you're like, I'm a star?  Like all those years of like, you know.  You don't say that.  Well, how about this?  Maybe I'm not a star.  Maybe not in the pompous language, but I certainly intend not to be something.  But I mean, when did you finally realize, like, okay, this is it. 
[02:06:00]  Like, I don't have to.  This is not going to go away.  Oh, when does that happen?  You haven't had it?  No.  No.  You know what I feel like?  I feel like John Locke.  Like, when I leave this island, I won't be able to walk again.  I'll be back to whatever the hell it was before, you know, and it'll be, that's what I feel like.  And that's, I think that's what most actors, I mean, Dustin Hoffman said, you know, every job is your last job and that's what you feel like.  And I don't have any, there's no, you know, there's no, I haven't had an indication yet.  People aren't knocking down the door and go, when are you going to be done with this?  Because I want to give you another job. 
[02:06:30]  Well, you'll be able to afford to do theater now.  It's really a break.  Yeah.  This will be novelty.  Seriously, this is going to be big for you.  Louis will let go of that.  I'm never going to let go of that.  I know you from the very beginning.  You're holding a grudge.  No, there's no grudge.  There's a little grudge.  I'm in theater too, putz.  Theater too.  It's called sharing a bad lifeboat, a leaky lifeboat.  Are you bitter on television?  No, we were in theater.  Are you bitter of his success?  We did theater.  I understand where you were.  No, we did theater. 
[02:07:00]  Got it?  I've had it with you.  Don't even go there.  Why the bitterness?  You're in regional theater.  Aren't you happy for a friend?  Somebody can be a star in regional theater.  If you're in the upper echelon in regional theater, it's kind of like having the good suit in the prison.  It's like having the newest outfit.  It's not like, I've got more cigarettes than you.  It is.  It is.  You're the one I was allowed to smoke.  But Louis came up to me and told me that.  I saw him at the Emmys just briefly.  He said, I remember that.  And I said, I can't. 
[02:07:30]  I said, see, you're one of my heroes.  I would vote for you, Louis.  Honestly, to God, I would.  Whoever wins, you should be their running mate.  He's got a great take on things.  You should be their running mate.  No, you should be Secretary of State.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  No, honestly, I think this guy's one of the geniuses of our age.  He's a great comedian.  He's a comic genius.  But Secretary of State, I don't know, we kind of have a press conference before noon.  He's passed out in a hotel somewhere.  I think, but see, that's the American way.  Pointing into the camera.  Let me tell you something.  I don't remember how I got homeless tonight. 
[02:08:00]  I don't know.  Well, you know, you got Condi Rice, you got Louis Blatt.  I think that's the way you swing.  Are you following the election there, Tim?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  What do you think?  I think that everybody, I think we should all have, you know, everybody, if everybody  had public funds, if we could only use public funds, we'd still be listening to Bill Richardson  and Kucinich and all these guys, I think.  You know, I hate that everybody's out of the race already.  And, you know, Edwards, whoever.  I mean, it's just no fun.  Yeah, before it gets down to us, I was saying, it's like going to a bullfight, where by the 
[02:08:30]  time it gets to the actual bullfighter, there's been so much damage done to the bull that it's  not really...  We, the people, do not have the vote.  It's made for us.  The decision's made.  And then there's a couple of people left.  And that's what we have to deal with.  Oh, thank you, sir.  Did you think so?  I don't know.  I thought you could do better.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I said it better.  I said it better at home.  Alone in the mirror.  Yes.  Nude.  And the pundits are so horrible. 
[02:09:00]  People picking these things are just boring the crap out of me.  Yeah.  Just like, you know, Hillary was it.  I mean, McCain is already debating Obama.  You know, in her victory speeches last night, McCain was already attacking Obama.  Yeah, like he's a Republican candidate.  I'm going like, God, this is going to get really, really boring.  Obama went on too long last night, too.  He fell down a little bit last night.  I thought he started out strong, and he just rolled, you know.  I turned on the internet, you know, turned down the television, turned it on 20 minutes  later, and he was still talking.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:09:30]  You know, I go, that's not a picture speech.  That's a little too long.  That's an oration.  A little full of himself.  Oh, he babbled a little bit too much?  Yeah.  He was probably just trying to, like, keep the mic tied up so his wife couldn't get on  and wreck things.  God almighty.  I love her.  She just, you know how she's nuts?  She has too much white stuff around her pupils, which is the sign of a psychopath.  Anyone that has that much white around, look at how he's all in his eyes right now.  Yeah, yeah, exactly like a psychopath.  He knows.  I love her.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  When we had Michael on a couple of days ago, we were talking about the beating he's just 
[02:10:00]  been taking and how hysterical it's been.  I've never seen a person be punched about the face by so many different people in the  show.  He's resilient, isn't he?  He certainly is.  He's a tough little guy.  Just when you're ready to kill him, too.  Talk about psychopathic eyes.  I'm sorry.  There's Michael.  Michael.  And, yeah.  Best friend on the show.  He's a really great guy to work with.  He's a real pro.  He's amazing.  And he can turn that character on in a second.  And just because he's not a he's not a big menacing guy, but it's just something about 
[02:10:30]  him that is frightening.  Yeah.  Well, he's got he's got that real psychopathic edge down.  Yeah.  He can do that in a minute.  Yeah.  Michael's funny.  You know, we're on the set and people give people give each other music on our set.  You know, Evangeline Lilly gives me like some like inspirational kind of, you know, thoughtful  sort of Zen music sometimes.  And Jorge Garcia gives you the sort of like the upfront people that that the really avant-garde  people in England are listening to that you won't hear for a year here, you know? 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  And Michael gives me Cliff Edwards, who was the voice of Jiminy Cricket, playing the ukulele  with 25 songs.  And it's one that's my favorite one.  It scares me, Michael, that you know, you know what I like.  Yeah.  That's that's Michael.  People are now obviously people are going to go, why didn't you ask about the show and  things?  Because they don't know.  They're not going to talk.  We don't know what the goddamn smoke is, OK?  Yeah.  We don't know.  No one knows what the smoke is.  Oh, good.  No, I don't.  No.  You know, when I first met the smoke, I was kind of disappointed because I always thought 
[02:11:30]  there was going to be some thing.  It was some big creature.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But you heard it rumbling and kind of strange smoke.  But I'm cool with the smoke.  Yeah.  Hopefully we'll find out.  Eventually we'll find out.  No more polar bears.  You know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  No more polar bears.  Yeah.  They don't TCG, whatever that thing is.  They don't do polar bears.  The CGI?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It kind of looks like something from the, what were those old Christmas specials they  would have with the rickety polar bear and the night before Christmas?  Yeah.  Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.  How do I not know that? 
[02:12:00]  All right.  We are running out of time here.  They're cutting us off.  We ended at 5 of 9.  But obviously Terry O'Quinn on Lost, which is every Thursday night.  Thursday night.  Come on.  9 o'clock.  Thursday night, 9 o'clock on ABC.  I love it.  Amazing.  Just an amazing show.  I've never been so hooked on a show.  Probably ever.  Where I can't miss it.  And I get annoyed when I have it TiVo'd or DVR'd and everyone else has seen it.  And I just, I gotta go, shut up. 
[02:12:30]  Shut up.  I've never seen so many people that don't want to know what happens.  It's just an amazing, like you said, written amazingly and the acting in it and the whole  ensemble is fantastic and you just do a great job.  My girlfriend started crying when you got shot.  We were on the plane, on the train, going down to Philly, I think.  And she starts crying and everyone's like, what's the matter?  You're like, Mark just got shot.  I think he'll be okay.  Although with that show, you don't know. 
[02:13:00]  But I think he'll be all right.  I don't need to ask if he died because he's here promoting it.  And so it's every Thursday night lost.  We really don't need to tell you when he lost us on.  Yeah, fantastic.  If you don't know how it's on, you haven't been living in this country.  So thank you so much for coming.  Yeah, absolutely.  It was nice to see you guys.  Thanks.  Lewis, do you have anything to plug?  Yeah.  Root of All Evil comes on March 12th.  Comedy Central.  That's your special?  Your stand-up special?  Stand-up special.  And then we'll soon be doing it in regional theaters.  Regional theater.  I'll be doing it with two middle acts.  Hey, what's that thing you're doing about the history of comedy or something? 
[02:13:30]  It's the history of the joke.  They had it on the History Channel.  It's on the History Channel.  Yeah.  How the mighty have fallen.  That's a little bit.  That's a both theater, isn't it?  I guess they've completely run out of Hitler footage?  That's right.  Jesus, come on.  Finally, right?  You've got to find something.  And I have to plug, this Friday night I'll be at The Egg in Albany.  Tickets 518-473-1845.  Go see him.  Or go to see Ticketmaster, whatever, theegg.org.  All right, we've got to get out of here.  Thank you, everybody. 
[02:14:00]  Have a great day.  Thanks.  We've got to get off of here.  Wow.  Wow.  But, girls, it's Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Who can improve on that?  And who would want to?  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The virus is spreading.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:14:30]  Thank you. 
[02:15:00]  Thank you. 
[02:15:30]  Thank you. 
[02:16:00]  Thank you. 
[02:16:30]  Thank you. 
[02:17:00]  Thank you. 
[02:17:30]  Thank you. 
[02:18:00]  Let's start with what you were telling me on the way over here, and then we'll get  into the USFO tour, which you started yelling at people.  I mean...  You need to think about...  But you were noticing that Anthony is quite the...  Anthony is gay.  I am stunned.  The closet thing, I had no idea.  What happened?  Well, once you were on with Locke, you have been one of the meanest pricks I've ever known 
[02:18:30]  in my life.  Thank you.  And he came on, and all of a sudden, you were like little Mr. Fruitcake.  We were doing after-show promos, and I was saying, why did you have to put both your hands on your  chin?  To listen to the answer to your question.  Look.  And then when he shined his shoes, I thought that was a little mud.  I get very starstruck with very few people, though. 
[02:19:00]  Right.  Not many people.  And I've told this before, when E-Rock, I had to break him in the habit of saying,  Anthony, you want to take a picture with our guest?  And I have to go, yeah.  Meanwhile, I don't want to take a picture with the guest.  Yeah, E-Rock always fucks you with that.  He would do that.  He goes, Anthony, picture?  He's the fucking worst.  He has no skills.  And what are you going to say at that point?  It's like, why would I want a picture with Pauly Shore for?  Yeah, it's like, nah. 
[02:19:30]  And then the person feels like shit.  What am I going to do with that?  So I go, don't mention the camera.  I'll do it.  So then, you know, with Lost Cast, I've gotten up and just gone, E-Rock, camera, immediately.  We've got to put a bit together of you being a fanboy.  And the only reason this is great stuff is because you don't get excited that often.  I don't.  No, you don't.  You get excited over the Lost guys.  You got excited over Ken Burns.  You got excited over...  Sean E. Smith, Ken Burns.  He's a documentary guy, yeah. 
[02:20:00]  No, no, you are gay.  I mean, I could see liking Ken Burns.  He does some great work.  He does.  The War was amazing.  And then the Civil War documentary was amazing.  Yeah.  Sean E. Smith.  Who else?  Sean E. Smith.  Joseph Goebbels.  And by the way, fanboy bit.  I talked to Derek already about getting some of the...  Yeah, we got it.  It has to happen.  Because it's something that Bob Kelly finally brought to everyone's attention.  Like, he goes into another world.  He forgets that he was actually broadcasting with other people. 
[02:20:30]  Well, speaking of...  He turns his head and is like this.  Blinders on.  I know.  It was unbelievable.  No one else is allowed to talk.  And then he gets nervous because you're trying to, like, possibly add to the conversation.  He's like little seven-year-old Anthony.  And then, do you like ice cream?  Because I like ice cream.  It's actually very sweet.  And then I try to bond.  Shut up.  It's cute.  I try to talk to him about theater, and he, like, starts to cry.  Yeah.  Well, you...  Why are you...  Look, here's the deal with Anthony.  I was really impressed.  You were butting in.  He's one of the better interviewers out there, without a doubt. 
[02:21:00]  But he also gets a little excited when he really likes the person.  Starstruck.  Do we have an example?  I think we have an example from today.  A little too excited?  Good way of phrasing.  Swooning jizzbucket.  Oh, no.  Here we go.  Here's a clip from today.  Obviously, Terry will put it on Lost, which is every Thursday night.  Thursday night.  Oh, nine o'clock.  Thursday night, nine o'clock on ABC.  I love it.  Amazing.  Just an amazing show.  I've never been so hooked on a show, probably ever, where I can't miss it. 
[02:21:30]  And I get annoyed when I have it TVO'd or DVR'd, and everyone else has seen it.  And I just say, I've got to go, shut up, shut up.  I've never seen so many people that don't want to know what happens.  It's just an amazing, like you said, written amazingly and the acting in it.  And the whole ensemble is fantastic.  You just do a great job.  My girlfriend started crying when you got shot.  We were on the plane, on the train, going down to Philly, I think.  And she starts crying. 
[02:22:00]  And everyone's like, what's the matter?  You're like, fuck, just got shot.  By the way, I had to start the music again.  You were just babbling.  End of the show, music's played.  It ends.  I wanted to talk with John Locke.  Wait a minute.  Can you guys, in the beginning, can you catch where I'm plugging when it's on?  Anthony hijacks my plug.  Listen to me.  I hijacked your plug.  He likes the guest.  He doesn't hear you.  He doesn't hear me. 
[02:22:30]  It's just him and the guest.  Let me throw this in.  It's a stupid, fat Bob Kelly texting me.  He goes, another chatty lost interview by chatty Cathy.  Stupid Bob Kelly.  Listen to him steal the fucking plug, though.  I'm trying to just play the beginning.  But obviously, Terry will put in on Lost, which is Thursday.  All right.  Lost.  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  I did hijack your plug.  But it was like you used Lost as a segue. 
[02:23:00]  Lost.  Lost.  Yes, Lost.  Keyword, Lost.  Yes, Lost people.  Lost, Jimmy.  Shut up.  The keyword is Lost.  Lost people.  I am like Lucy with Ricky when it comes to celebrities.  I lose my mind.  And there are only certain few.  Just a few.  It's like now, if you get Kate from Lost in there, I'll be a babbling, stupid mess.  How about Saeed?  Saeed's another one. 
[02:23:30]  Great actor.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  I don't get like that.  I don't get it.  I mean, I don't know why you start talking like that people.  Oh, Ozzy fucking walks in.  You were a stammering idiot.  I handled it.  Play any interview.  Play any word out of your mouth when you sat down with all of Black Sabbath.  But that is some of the funniest shit I've ever heard.  Jimmy doesn't have a leg to stand on because the famous address, something about a dress,  dress, address, there was a dress, something about a dress, I handled it.  Do we have that clip for loose luck?  I handled it.  Something about a dress.  We all have our weaknesses during these interviews. 
[02:24:00]  And yes, mine is like big television celebrities that I watch this show.  Sure.  I mean, my weakness is not knowing anything about the people I'm about to interview.  Perhaps that's your weakness.  Yeah, it's never noticeable.  Terry Hatcher has come in.  I said Terry O'Neill today.  Show Lost in Space.  Terry O'Neill.  We have Andrew Morton.  Back to Smith.  Andrew Morton wrote a book about Scientology and Ron L. Hubbard. 
[02:24:30]  Ron L. Hubbard.  Did I say Ron L. Hubbard?  Of course you did.  Oh, wonderful.  I do love that.  I can't lie.  It's like, well.  Hopi is the I could give a shit guy.  Just, why not?  Yeah, we all have very unique personalities when it comes to these interviews.  I'm not a big guy.  I've never really enjoyed giving interviews.  I like, I did that thing for the comedy, you know, that history of the joke thing.  And I interviewed comics.  I like interviewing comics because I never get to ask questions. 
[02:25:00]  I didn't get called for that.  You did, actually.  You did.  And so don't ever cross that line again.  Don't ever cross that line again.  No one called me for that.  Don't ever cross that line again with me.  How come no one called me?  Don't ever cross the line again.  I'm hurt.  You were called.  By who?  By whoever the powers that be.  You were.  Why did I do it?  Because I had.  Because you, you know why?  Because you're busy.  You are like a working comedian.  I was hurt, though.  I wanted to.  No, you didn't want to know.  You didn't even know about it until today.  If I find out my managers... 
[02:25:30]  You didn't even know about it until today.  Don't cross that line again.  If I find out...  Don't cross that line again, mister.  If I find out my manager didn't tell me...  They're going to lie to you, and I'm going to lie to you, and you're going to lie to me.  So that's show business.  And why do we have to sit here and discuss this?  They did, though.  I said to get you.  I gave them to you.  Oh, no.  I was saying.  What am I, nuts?  It's like people in New York.  Get Jim Norton.  I'm very hurt.  And then they go, don't be hurt.  You should see some of the stuff.  I'll call my manager.  Okay.  And listen.  It's time to embarrass Jimmy.  It's time to embarrass Jimmy. 
[02:26:00]  I won't be embarrassed.  I know what I'm doing.  Jimmy, come join me under this Greyhound bus.  Could you please?  This is Jimmy being...  Who was I interviewing?  Extremely smooth.  This is Zach Wilde, the guitarist for Ozzy Osbourne.  Very smooth.  I like Zach.  He's good.  And I thought he wore a dress one time, and it was funny, so I talked about it.  Yeah, Jimmy's got a very smooth way of interviewing these people.  Just listen.  When did you let him start interviewing?  I don't know.  He's just taking over.  It's just like...  He just...  Here it is.  Listen to this.  You did something in a dress. 
[02:26:30]  I don't...  It was fucking...  It was in Philadelphia.  I mean, Kim from YSP, who was in love with you, was telling me that you did something  in a dress.  I don't know what it was.  Did you go on stage in a dress, or did you do something in public with a dress that  was really completely uncalled for and hilarious?  In a dress.  I'm sure it was.  I'm sure it was awesome.  It was definitely gay.  I'm sure we pulled it off.  Of course.  You know, when you got guys that are weighing about 265, 250, 245, you know, with dresses  that they're bursting out of.  I mean...  No, we got to make sure the dresses are for like a 13-year-old pubescent girl.  You know what I mean?  So that's like...  She hasn't even had puberty yet, so you know. 
[02:27:00]  She said you went to a mall.  You were in a mall or something like that with a dress, and you had like your chain wallet.  She said it was like the most ridiculous thing she'd ever seen.  That's where I was at.  Yeah, I was out in...  She was in Boston, or we were hanging out in Philly or something like that.  But yeah, it was definitely beyond gay.  It was a bunch of grown men, and we made sure...  Yeah, we went to like a Victoria's Secret and just got the most insane...  No, where you're just...  You know, I can get you in the smallest stuff that like a 13-year-old will wear.  Oh, of course.  And you're just bursting out of these dresses and everything like that.  It was awesome.  You just gave him an idea.  No. 
[02:27:30]  See?  Was it a dress?  You were at a mall in a dress?  Something with a dress.  I heard a story about a dress.  There was a dress.  You were in a dress.  Holy shit, enough about the dress.  He must have hated this dress.  Dude, I'll admit that I was...  I said dress perhaps 40 or 50 times too many.  That was all.  I didn't know.  It's called Get the New Listeners.  You have to keep resetting.  Every day longer.  Derrick and Steve just handed this in. 
[02:28:00]  When Penis Met Throaty.  We could curse over here, Lois.  I gathered.  When Penis Met Throaty.  Yeah.  Penis Met Throaty.  Are they going to explain this or are we just push play on this one?  I'd say push play.  They just ran.  They're hiding.  All right.  He was a comedian looking for love in all the wrong places.  So I'm standing in line in a towel.  Watch.  Seven other men.  Enduring one failed relationship after another. 
[02:28:30]  She was like trying to be dominating and sexy, but I just wanted to kick her in the face.  But one trip to San Francisco changed everything.  Oh.  Jim Norton from the Opie and Anthony show in his most heartwarming performance ever.  When Penis Met Throaty.  The story of a man whose endless search for love could only be fulfilled by miles of unclipped man meat.  Where relationships fail, incessant hardcore throat fucking succeeds. 
[02:29:00]  When Penis Met Throaty.  Coming to a gay bathhouse near you.  That's pretty good.  That's pretty funny.  I would just end with more of him puking.  Yeah.  Right after that last line.  Oh yeah, that was exactly the one mistake I saw. 
[02:29:30]  Yes.  Fade out.  After that, yes.  It was all waiting.  And cut the gay bathhouse reference.  Nobody goes to a gay bathhouse.  No.  What's a bathhouse?  How about coming to a theater near you?  I don't know.  Where do they go then?  Gay bathhouse.  I think they just do it online.  Yes.  We have very mild.  Thank you, sweet potato.  We're Steve.  We have very mild criticism.  Lewis, what's wrong?  That's sweet potato.  It's one of the American Idol rejects.  Exactly.  We're lucky to have him.  I keep telling him, wear tighter pants, but he refuses. 
[02:30:00]  Right.  I want, Steve, I have a very brief criticism, but I like that piece a lot.  Gay bathhouse reference, Lewis?  Absolutely right.  Has to come out.  Has to come out.  Because again, it's very much like a novice talking about gay people.  Yeah.  Which is okay.  I don't feel like we should.  No, comedically I mean.  Like, it's almost, again, it's like an on crack reference.  It's like in the gay bath, first of all, bathhouse is enough.  No one would think a straight bathhouse.  Are there straight bathhouses?  Of course there's not. 
[02:30:30]  There's not even gay ones.  How about coming to a theater near you?  Because that's funnier.  The throat fucking cock throat, whoever it's called.  It's When Penis Met Throaty.  That's going to be in a real theater.  You have to promote it like it's a real movie.  I love When Penis Met Throaty.  It's hilarious.  I think you're not loving it.  No, that was good.  We've got to get the Weinsteins involved or the Weinsteins or whatever.  Weinsteins.  I go with Weinstein.  Hey, USO tour.  It drove you nuts, huh, Lewis?  No, it was great, except it was.  Too long?  No, I just have never been through.  It was like doing a seven-day acid trip. 
[02:31:00]  It was.  Really?  Your mind gets blown every day.  We flew 16 hours.  It's just you do stuff you've never done.  Did you fly over with the Joint Chiefs and Robin and David?  Yeah, the whole hoo-ha.  You fly there.  What do you do for 16 hours on a plane?  And it's not a comfortable plane, right?  Or is it?  No, it is.  It's like Air Force 2.  It's a what?  We flew on Air Force 2, so I made sure I took a dump where Cheney would dump it. 
[02:31:30]  So what's Air Force 2?  That's better than Air Force 1?  No, it's the one, whatever.  Air Force 1 is the president, and Air Force 2 is who's like the Joint Chiefs, the Vice  President, kind of guys.  How big was the plane?  It's a big jumbo.  Seats go all the way back?  Seats go all the way back.  Seats don't go all the way back.  What the fuck?  They didn't have a seat just goes United.  No.  It's a United plane, actually.  They should have sleeper seats for you, Lewis.  No, they don't.  You could get a little snooze.  No, basically, it's the same as you get on a first class on a plane, and it goes back 
[02:32:00]  about three quarters of the way, and you take a pill and knock yourself out for six hours,  and then you've still got ten hours to go.  What's in the back?  Wow.  You watch probably a lot of movies and stuff, and your foot is good, right?  And then there's, you know, and then there's like, in the front of the plane is all of  this area where, try to stay awake while I'm talking.  Yeah, I'm just giving it a whirl.  And the fucking Air Force Two.  If it was Air Force One, it would have been good.  Yeah, I know.  You know Terry O'Quinn, Lewis.  Yeah, I know. 
[02:32:30]  Exactly.  It's certainly, it's like he'd had sex with Terry O'Quinn.  I was awake during his interview.  That doesn't give you confidence, huh, Lewis?  When you see one of the hostess yawning openly at you, you try to tell him.  But it's perfect.  It's an interesting story.  Go ahead, Lewis.  Tell the story.  I got a text.  It makes me feel like I'm on the right track if he's yawning.  Right.  Tell the story.  I got a text.  I actually, I want to know, because I always thought they would have sleeper seats, and  you'd be able to do what you wanted.  Yeah, you'd think it would be.  Did you sit next to Robin?  I sat across from Robin and next to Lance Armstrong and across from Kid Rock. 
[02:33:00]  Did Lance Armstrong tie his ball bag off like the end of a balloon?  No.  Like Joaquin Phoenix's cleft lip?  But Lance kept saying after a while that he was going to whip me into shape, and I kept  saying to him, he didn't understand that I was an evolutionary jump ahead of him, that  I'd reach the point.  He's still worried about his body.  I'm living way beyond it.  As a matter of fact, the body is just what I enter to kind of do this stuff, and then  most of the time I'm floating around.  I got to ask you, Lewis, can you tell that he only had one testicle? 
[02:33:30]  Yeah, because it's on the side of his face.  But in photos, they airbrush it out.  That's funny.  What would he do if he was sleeping?  Did you walk around when he fell asleep and try poking the front of his pants to see what  side the fucking deflated balloon was on?  I would have poked his bag in his fucking jeans.  Hopefully he wore like sportabouts, like fucking light blue sportabouts, because your balls 
[02:34:00]  are so visible.  He's a hero, Jimmy.  Is he?  Just Lance Armstrong.  He fucking rode a bike with one ball.  Applause, applause.  Oh, fuck yourself.  Well, you try to ride a bike straight down the road with one ball.  Why would I?  I'd fucking hop in a cab.  Take me.  I got one ball.  I'm tired.  Fucking beat it.  Beat it.  Show off.  What are you going to do with director scrotum skin?  And he probably wraps around his cock like a fucking cocktail wiener and tells jokes.  Wow.  Fuck you.  Wow.  Wow.  They love this guy, though, this Lance.  They love him. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah, good for him.  Zip around the mountain again.  Fucking mister, it's all about you.  Then fucking eat Sheryl Crow's ass.  You're boring me.  Always making left turns because he has one ball.  Of course he is.  He's really good at karate on one side.  Hi-ya!  The other leg just won't lift up.  Fucking talk to me about your nut.  We get it.  But he survived ball cancer, Jimmy.  I mean, I think that's good that he did that.  I respect that.  He's got an inspirational story with a lot of people that are fighting the big C out there. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, he does.  He fucking just keeps removing things so he's lighter and he can ride faster.  It's fucking cheating.  Why don't you just have your arms taken off?  Fucking tape your face to the handlebars so you're a little lighter.  Fighting the big C, Sheryl Crow.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  So, uh...  Yeah, so, yeah, well...  I didn't mean a word of that, by the way.  Yeah, I know you.  Of course not.  Of course not.  Of course I did.  Yeah.  No, the, uh...  No, it's a...  It was one of the most insane things I've ever done.  We literally flew 16 hours, got off, did a show. 
[02:35:30]  Mm-hmm.  Got in Qatar, which I didn't even...  Which I thought...  Actually, if you look it up, I thought that means permanent cold is when you have a Qatar.  Then we flew to Kuwait, did a show there.  We flew to Iraq, did two shows in Iraq.  You...  Did you take a different plane or they landed Air Force 2?  We landed Air Force 2, then we got on a...  One of those...  We got on every different type of plane.  We were on a...  I was going to say, I ain't going to fly Air Force 2 into, uh...  No.  ...Iraq.  I don't think...  No, no.  That'd be a nice prize for an insurgent. 
[02:36:00]  No, you get in a...  We got in a, uh, you know, whatever, troop carrier.  We came in...  There were two different troop carriers around.  We were on choppers.  They put, uh...  I said it's the only place in my entire life that I felt, when I was there for the seven  days, I felt like a pussy.  They put those...  They put flak jackets on you when you go to Iraq and, uh, and, uh, Afghanistan, and  you put the hat on your head and the whole thing, and it, uh, I, it, I was like too much  exercise.  It's like an 18-pound jacket.  I would rather they...  Not even, like, running with all this shit on. 
[02:36:30]  Just putting it on.  20 pounds.  It's like 25 pounds of stuff.  And then they handed me a rifle.  I said, well, what's this like?  Give me the rifle.  I was like, I wanted to just...  I said, you'd have to take me around in a wheelchair.  It was like absurd.  Who was on the show?  It was, uh, had the show.  How was that structured?  The show was structured as follows, James.  Um, the show was...  Like, I mean, like, who headlined it and had to work?  It's a cool show.  Well, Lance Armstrong's the headliner.  No, Miss USA.  Miss USA opened.  She must have been terrific.  What does she do? 
[02:37:00]  Except look good for this.  Besides, way down the fucking entertainment value.  What could she have done?  Hi, look at my tits.  Wow.  I have nothing to say.  Yeah, she looked good for the first two rows, and then everyone else is not close enough  to the stage to see that she looks good.  Wow.  Suck on Lance's empty sack like a balloon.  Yeah, yeah.  And try to puff it up.  Wow.  It's like it's fucking taffy on the boardwalk.  Wow.  What's wrong, Lewis?  Well, it's just interesting.  The USO tour takes place.  Kind of like to help the guys out.  I got America's favorite Nazi over here. 
[02:37:30]  Mr. I...  We can't send enough troops over there.  We go to entertain them.  He immediately...  You guys just start slicing and dicing these poor people.  I'm with you with this story.  I've been nice the whole time.  That is very nice.  I am literally here to serve up.  It is very nice.  I've been through this shit, you know, okay?  I was there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's right.  I went with fucking Laurie Kilmartin and old cancer legs, Colin Quinn.  Old fucking...  Yes, those fucking camel-legged idiots.  I want to hear the lineup, though.  It starts with the...  Oh, yeah.  It started with her. 
[02:38:00]  She did...  She was great, because she did...  Basically did a paragraph.  Yeah.  What did she do, though?  A paragraph?  No, she just intro'd me.  She flew 16 hours to say a paragraph?  Yeah, it's called morale.  And make you do all the heavy fucking lifting?  It's morale-boosting.  What...  Was she in a hot outfit?  Uh, yeah.  Like what?  Like probably a one-piece swimsuit.  That's what they used to do in the noms.  Remember when they brought in the Playboy bunnies in the noms?  Yeah, but you got to see nipple back then.  It's weird, but it's weird now, because...  You see Nip?  There's women on... 
[02:38:30]  There are women there.  So it's weirder.  It's not like NOM.  Yeah.  The women in...  And some of the women in uniform are...  Were hot.  I mean, seriously hot.  There were some women working there.  You went...  Yeah, but you used to do...  Oh, really?  Oh, really?  Theater, too, so...  I'm used to...  Look, I'm used to...  You know, occasionally a muskox is good.  To me, if I'm...  If there's a 48-hour period where the...  You know, there's the thing is...  And there's semen backup, so...  I'm certainly no...  So she flies 16 hours, and she reads a paragraph, and introduces you.  Yeah, and she hangs... 
[02:39:00]  That's all she does.  No, but they also...  That's it.  No.  You do...  You do two to three to four to five hours...  I'm popping you up, Louis.  Don't be so...  No, they do five hours of autographs and stuff.  But don't be so defensive.  I'm totally...  I'm basically saying it's bullshit that she flies 16 hours, and gets to look good for 30 seconds  on the stage, and you're working your balls off.  I did 15 minutes...  With a 25-pound fucking jacket.  No, but I didn't work with a flight...  If I couldn't have done it with a jacket on, I'd have just...  Then I do...  And then she introduces me, I come on.  Yeah.  I introduce Lance.  He comes on.  He...  What does he do? 
[02:39:30]  What does Lance do?  Because I know what you do.  You're brilliant.  You're a brilliant comedian.  Lance basically talked about how we were put in a room.  At one point, we couldn't get into Baghdad to do the show, so we were stuck in this place.  They had no room for us, and they put us in a room with four bunk beds, eight people.  And I will tell you that, fuck you, is all I have to say.  You don't put me in a bunk bed, all right?  Why?  Because I'm fucking almost 60.  Okay?  I've flown a billion miles.  But it brings you back...  I don't give a shit. 
[02:40:00]  Put me on a couch.  I'm not in a room with eight guys.  It brings you back to being a child, Lewis.  I never went to camp.  I see bunk beds in my nephew's house, and it brings me back a little.  I don't go to camp.  And you don't go...  You see bunk beds.  Your nephew doesn't sit with 16 other guys in their house.  Was Robin in a bunk bed?  Everybody was in a bunk bed.  Were you the top or the bottom?  I was bottom.  I'm not going up top.  Lance was top.  I'm not going up there.  Was Lance whacking his one bag? 
[02:40:30]  It was literally like, this is what it was like.  Fart, fart, fart, fart, snore, fart, fart, snore, snore, fart.  Lance said he didn't enjoy the flight, but he had a ball.  Yeah.  So Lance does his psychobabble, which means nothing.  He does, then Robin.  Robin who?  Robin does 15.  Robin Williams.  And then Kid Rock.  You got in with the rock, right?  I liked him.  I'm not saying anything bad.  We've had him on the show.  Nobody wants to want to have to capture Kid Rock.  You don't want to want to.  Would a Robin Williams make like earrings out of hand grenades or something? 
[02:41:00]  Wow.  Wow.  Wow, guys.  Wow.  This is just weird, Don.  He looked at me just like, wow.  He says it's extraordinary.  Wow.  Why is this extraordinary?  Oh, look.  Just extraordinary.  I made earrings.  Oh, look.  No, it's because you spend, there's something about spending that much time on the road with  people for six days that you're locked up with.  And the USO is taking you around, and you feel like you're basically, after a while,  you're, because they make stuff up. 
[02:41:30]  They go, tonight we're going to have a really good meal.  And it's like cocktail sausages.  And, you know, you just go, stop lying to me.  Just don't, I don't make shit up anymore.  Yeah.  You know, you're in, and I've got to say, I mean, I've just, they busted their chops.  Robin busted his chops.  I mean, whatever anybody thinks about Robin.  He got off that plane, he starts talking to these guys.  The moment he gets off the plane until he gets back, it was insane.  Well, it's all the talking.  And I'm, and I'm sitting, oh, my God.  Did he bring Coke on the joint chief's plane?  You know what you're saying, Lewis? 
[02:42:00]  Lewis.  Robin was doing Coke on Jamie's pillow.  Where did he stash the Coke?  What's wrong, Lewis?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  You tap it out yet?  I'm tapped out.  Was he funny?  I don't even want to talk about this anymore.  Was he funny?  It was exhausting going on the trip, but now I'm four times more exhausted.  I would love to have gone on that plane, though.  Like, I had to go commercial.  We flew America.  I flew with Colin Quinn and Laurie Kilmartin, and we flew American.  To British Airways, to Kuwait, and then the C-130s.  I just love poking at Lewis.  Wow.  It's so much fun. 
[02:42:30]  Give me a stick.  Did Robin rip a nut out and do a Lance Armstrong impression?  Wow.  I love the wow.  Very dedicated to the impression.  Man, oh man.  You do realize what show you're on, right?  No, I know that.  Did you forget about us or something?  No, but it's just...  I know it's been a long time.  But it's the attack.  It is mean.  It is just extraordinary.  You attack a group of people who went...  There's no reason to attack you.  ...that are trying to do it the right thing.  I can see it out of any other context.  I understand the attack.  Lewis, why don't you tell us by the USO tour?  Okay. 
[02:43:00]  Fuck you, Lewis, and fuck the rest of them.  You thought we really cared about your dumb story.  That's the beauty of this.  Oh my God.  For instance.  For instance.  But I happen to like...  Robin's a friend of mine.  I like Robin a lot.  I'm sure he was funny, Lewis.  No, he wasn't.  Nobody was funny.  It was hell.  You were funny.  No, I wasn't.  Why wouldn't you be funny?  I wasn't.  Nah.  I went over there to fuck with him.  Lewis, did you leave your semen behind?  Where?  In Iraq.  Like, if I went to Iraq, I would think that I would have to like leave my mark and just  leave some semen somewhere. 
[02:43:30]  Just, what do you mean?  Willy nilly?  Yeah.  Just spray it.  Back out of batch.  Just spray it around a little bit.  No, I was too tired to masturbate.  Really?  You're fucking A.  You kidding me?  I think I scrapped one with stupid Colin and his giant head sleeping like 10 feet away.  I think I quietly had my toes aimed straight and I fucking spilled a load in my filthy  belly button.  Did you really?  Yeah, then wiped it up with a tissue.  I was too goddamn tired.  That's a shame.  It was.  You haven't lived until you, you know, threw some semen around in Iraq. 
[02:44:00]  No, I didn't.  Uh-uh.  No?  So you're friends with Lance and all these guys now?  Oh, yeah.  You can see they're waiting downstairs for me.  Well, I mean, you could call him and go, hey, it's Lois.  Yeah, let's call Lance Armstrong.  Let's put him on the show.  No, we're not putting Lance on the show.  All right, give me the number.  I want to call him.  I don't have his number.  Why didn't you get it?  Do you have Robin's number?  Yeah.  No.  Lance's number is one.  I'm close to you guys.  I don't call you.  But, well, Kid Rock was cool, right?  Did you become friendly with him?  I'm not going to tell you.  I like Kid Rock.  We've had him on the show. 
[02:44:30]  Well, that's good.  Just playing guitar and stuff.  He was great to us.  Kid Rock was great.  And he was also above and beyond the Call of Duty.  Yeah.  Well, Lois, I got a surprise for you.  Do you smell his fingers?  No.  I would have.  Do you smell Lance Armstrong's finger?  No.  After he scratched his one ball?  No.  No, we did not.  Smell like half an onion.  Lois, are you officially getting too old for this show?  No.  No.  You're not taking it like you should.  Lois fucking looks like Janis Joplin.  No, he just drinks as an animal. 
[02:45:00]  Lois is a fucking animal.  He hides that from us, though.  I will talk about his alcoholism.  I kind of got a glimpse of that after the virus tour when he was just drinking.  Bring me the fucking wine.  I'm not saying he's an alcoholic.  I just said that he drinks a lot.  Like, you know, he's a fucking rock star.  Yeah.  You like your wine, right?  I like my wine.  We were actually talking about wine.  We felt so stupid.  We're actually trying to, like, relate to each other.  Well, yeah, it was like, give me the $8 bottle.  We were actually having a... 
[02:45:30]  As opposed to the $6 bottle.  We were actually having a real moment, and we were both very uncomfortable during it.  It's like...  No, I'm not getting too old for the shot.  It's just talking about that, really.  I just...  That was so...  You don't age, by the way.  Fucking brutal.  We're aging, like, really quickly, and you're, like, the same as you were 10 years ago when  you fucking started doing our show.  Norton looks phenomenal.  Thank you, Lewis.  You do.  Thank you.  It's the Botox.  I don't think...  It must be the Botox.  I got some Botox to sit in my cock skin.  You know, the only one that's...  And Anthony looks exactly the same as he looked when he was 21. 
[02:46:00]  Oh, yeah.  He's not changed at all.  He was 21, 30 years ago.  I'm a vampire.  A little gray.  A little gray.  But not bad.  Of course.  He's slimmer than he was.  Anthony's in better shape than he was.  Mm-hmm.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  That's right.  Really?  Thank you.  That was a real moment.  I know.  I'm going to slip that Lewis right there, right?  I...  What are you going to do?  I'll think of that line when I'm at the gym again today.  I know.  Yeah, show him your guns. 
[02:46:30]  No, I'm not showing my guns.  Anthony, come on.  They're so huge.  Anthony's got a fucking body on him.  No, look at his guns.  They're very intimidating.  You're going to be jealous.  Well, he's been shitting.  Don't be intimidated.  Look, here it is.  Don't be intimidated.  He's got good genes.  Don't be intimidated.  Look at that, huh?  See?  Don't be intimidated.  God damn it.  You got good arms.  See?  You do.  I've been working out since last April.  You're a good body.  Trying.  Do you like it?  No, it stinks.  No, I do like it.  Do you like it?  You get, what do they call it?  Pheromones?  What is that?  That fucking shit you get in your head?  It's called...  I don't know what it is, but it makes you fucking tired. 
[02:47:00]  Well, you feel good.  Yeah.  No, you kind of...  You feel good because you did something that you know is good for you.  The exercise itself just makes you fucking tired.  You're right.  But it helps you sleep better.  Yeah.  Does it?  I haven't been exercising as well, if anybody wants to know.  I really haven't.  I was doing well, and then I stopped.  I'm not big.  You go to a gym?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I hate those.  You have to, though.  I hate those.  I hate them.  You have to do something regimented.  I don't care.  Make it the same time, the same day. 
[02:47:30]  I can't walk in there with those people.  No?  No.  I could go to a gym with you guys where there's a sense of humor, but these guys in there...  Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.  I'm, you know, I'm, you know, look at, I've got, you know, arms of, whatever, bands of  steel, whatever the fuck it is they do.  And then it costs like $300 to dress up to get into the gym.  Yeah, you go.  What are you fucking, you're fucking working out, putts.  I just got sweatpants.  Yeah, you got sweatpants.  You know what they're saying about you?  I got sweaty sweatpants.  And they go, here comes douchebag. 
[02:48:00]  I don't give a shit.  Here comes douchebag exerciser.  I don't, I do, I just don't like it.  I don't, I feel like I've always felt when the first time I, well, I went into one of  those places that I'm, I'm like in a gay bathhouse.  Do you keep on your health and stuff?  Like do you checkups and stuff?  Are you good at that?  You mean, do you checkups and see a doc?  I mean, yeah, like are you, are you good at that or do you like just ignore it and go  Oh, no, no.  I see a doctor every three days.  That's funny.  Hey. 
[02:48:30]  I missed it.  I missed the seg, but we're going to go backwards anyway.  Talking about the USO tour earlier this morning.  Did you hear us playing the Dave Rabbit tapes?  No.  Oh, this guy's the fucking greatest.  Holy shit, this is good.  Seriously, we're going to all relate to that.  Apparently, this is very rare, too.  Supposedly, I got one of two copies, I'm learning.  What each?  I don't know.  It was this guy, Dave Rabbit.  He was in Vietnam and he did an underground radio show.  Oh, is this the guy I just, and he was smart enough.  Where's Z-Rock?  He's got all the info on the guy, but basically he just was doing underground radio. 
[02:49:00]  He did the show.  In Vietnam?  Vietnam.  Out of a whorehouse, right?  Out of a whorehouse, a back room of a whorehouse.  Here's Z-Rock to just reset the bit.  Z-Rock, reset.  Go.  Yeah, just a really interesting guy.  We don't know much about him, but we're finding more info online as we speak.  Yeah.  He rented out the back room of a whorehouse, built the bedroom into a studio with mattresses  and tile to prevent you hearing sex going on around the rooms around him, and he would 
[02:49:30]  just broadcast, sometimes illegally, on the Armed Force Radio Network signal.  And I was reading online.  It turns out his show was more popular outside of Vietnam, like in Germany and other European  countries where people were stationed.  They used to trade these tapes around.  So somebody was taping them in Vietnam and then mail them out all throughout the service.  Well, was he like the Good Morning Vietnam guy?  Completely different.  Completely the other side.  Why did I hear?  I just heard about him.  Instead of high energy, he was like, he was tripping. 
[02:50:00]  He was high.  He was really mellow, but really witty.  Really funny with the one-liners.  Can we have one?  I want to hear him.  Well, this is the one that we had a bleep on the other side.  I love him.  But we have new ones for over here where he talks about like hand jobs, blow jobs, the  latest specials that the whorehouse is running.  But here's Dave Rabbit from 1971 in Vietnam.  How cool is this guy?  Guys in the field are just listening to this shit as they're hoping that they're going to survive  another day.  Fuck number 69, James Gang. 
[02:50:30]  Sorry about that yelling and screaming, but Pete and I are on a trip and we thought we'd  have to get in on that song.  Here's one done by the Biggie, Three Dog Knight. 
[02:51:00]  It's called Mama Told Me Not to Come.  And you can take this two ways.  As a title or your girlfriend's name is Mama.  How great is that?  Wow.  Yeah.  1970 or 71.  Yeah.  But in Nam.  Yeah.  In a whorehouse.  Yeah.  Which clips do we have to bleep out?  It's amazing.  The lifers.  The lifers are like flies.  That's a funny one too. 
[02:51:30]  Oh, wait.  This one we should replay the t-shirt because they had to bleep the shit out of it today.  Think about it.  Now, how long did it take to come to the surface?  When you think about it.  I mean, it's probably been circulating on tape and then with the internet.  I've had a copy of this for 20 years.  Have you really?  I found it in a box.  You don't even know where you got it, do you?  My buddy Stork, who got it from some guy in the Buffalo area who might have another tape  where we're hunting it down.  Because if he'd been on, like, let's say it was today, if this was today and he was doing 
[02:52:00]  this, like two days after he did the first show, it would be around the world.  Yeah.  Oh, I know.  You know.  It's amazing how this was traded around back in the day.  This is 70.  Yeah, it's extraordinary.  You've got to mail this shit.  Get the postage right and all that crap.  Instead of pushing a button on your computer.  From Vietnam.  I think we might talk to him tomorrow, we're hoping.  Wow.  Here's one where he was selling.  He got so popular, he had stuff he was selling.  This is a sweatshirt.  He was selling stuff.  Yeah, he was a marketing genius, too.  Pinball Wizard by The Who. 
[02:52:30]  I've had quite a few letters recently concerning some of the different items that Radio First  Termer has to offer his followers.  And one of the biggest things is the official Dave Rabbit sweatshirt.  For those of you who are unaware of what a Dave Rabbit sweatshirt is, I'll tell you.  It's a white sweatshirt.  On the front of it, it has a large, white rabbit. 
[02:53:00]  And the rabbit's dick is completely hard.  The rabbit is carrying a sign.  On the sign, it reads,  Fuck it, before it fucks you.  If you like one of these Dave Rabbit sweatshirts, send a postcard along with 298 to Dave Rabbit sweatshirt.  Radio Saigon, underground, APON country, 96969. 
[02:53:30]  Wow.  Cream.  Lightroom.  Wow.  That guy is funny.  That's funny.  That guy is funny.  Yeah, his slogan was,  The hits keep on coming.  There's a t-shirt behind you there.  Fuck it.  The actual t-shirt.  I want my brother to make a version of this shirt.  Wow.  Yeah.  Fucking look at the big fucking cock of the rabbit.  Jesus.  How about, can we get, um...  He has more balls than Lance Armstrong. 
[02:54:00]  Oh, we stopped.  That was Lewis.  I'm sorry.  His friend.  Gee.  Yeah.  Hey, do we have, wait, do we have any, uh, I want that clip with the flies, uh, the lifers  are like, oh yeah, that's the one I was asking about, E-Rock?  I think it's the second, um, message from the latrine.  That's, uh, 22 maybe?  All right, we're gonna play new clips, because I know people have been with us all morning.  We got new clips just for XM, where they're talking about the handjobs, the blowjobs.  I mean, this is just online, you can just pick it up?  Um, I... 
[02:54:30]  I mean, do you buy it?  I don't know.  Oh, you can download that.  I found the tape, brought it in, and I had no idea how popular the guy actually is, uh,  still, so...  I gotta, that's why.  I just wonder.  Yeah, here we go.  Um, him, uh, he did this bit called, uh, message from the latrine walls, just reading  what people are writing on walls.  That's great.  In the bathroom.  Let's steal it.  Cactus, you can't judge a book by looking at his cover.  Here's another quickie from the latrines in the Republic of Vietnam. 
[02:55:00]  This guy writes, fighting for someone else's freedom is like fucking for someone else's virginity.  That's not the one.  No.  What power?  Oh, that's the one we had a bleep earlier, too.  Oh, twat power?  Twat power, but, um...  Twat power.  Hey, uh, yeah, we got their attention.  Uh, for the love of God, please go to abovetopsecret.com. 
[02:55:30]  Dave has a radio show on this site.  We'd love to have you here.  Come on over.  Dave is still as crazy as ever.  I'm a moderator there.  Contact me to...  To...  Elevate...  Done.  Something like that.  Ooh.  We got this contact.  I contacted, uh, Dave directly last night, so we're gonna try to...  Does he sound insane?  Um, it took a while before he would confess that it was really him.  Like, he kept fishing for information from me before he would talk to me.  What, is he hiding out? 
[02:56:00]  He's been hiding out.  Yeah, he's got the Vietnam mentality.  Wow.  He's, like, still living the dream.  Yeah.  Look out.  Am I still coming to grab you?  He's still living the dream.  Afraid of getting grabbed.  No kidding.  Do you blame him?  Where's the other one, Iraq?  Maybe it's this one?  All right, hold on.  We're gonna...  A couple more clips from Dave Rabbit.  During the night, we're gonna be reading some of the things off of latrine walls around  the Republic of Vietnam.  Here's one of them.  While I'm home, my wife is my right hand. 
[02:56:30]  While I'm away, my right hand is my wife.  Who's cooler than this fucking dude?  No shit.  It's unbelievable.  Playing all new music.  Oh, yeah.  For the time.  Yeah.  Yeah, this was, like...  No, it's unbelievable. 
[02:57:00]  Brand new from The Who.  Yeah, he's...  Cream.  Cream.  White room.  We're gonna let this next one roll on through.  Why?  Well, for one reason, I'm gonna go take a big, heavy crap.  Boring, unforeseen incidences that may occur during my trip to the latrine, such as being 
[02:57:30]  picked up for marijuana, or stopping in and getting a quick fuck with one of the whores  down the hall.  I'll be back to finish this goddamn program.  Wow.  He would've fit in with us, man.  This goddamn program.  And where's he working now?  We don't know.  We're trying to find out more about it.  Is he just on the web doing it?  He's doing a podcast.  Yeah, it's like a podcast.  Wow.  Where's the one about this shit?  Yeah, who would you fucking want this guy on? 
[02:58:00]  Why doesn't Satellite Radio hire him?  Maybe it's the third one.  Yeah.  Fucking man, for a guy like that, he's just great.  What am I talking about?  I don't know.  Where is it?  I'm boring myself.  I could've just stopped after, why does the Satellite hire him?  Why don't you, where comes his manager?  I just spiraled out of control.  Yeah.  I had nothing to say.  He talks about the lifers.  Oh, I think this is it right here.  Okay.  I love this one.  Well, actually, we got, let me play this one, too, because these are all unedited.  Way better when you hear the curses. 
[02:58:30]  This motherfucker is so goddamn long.  Oh, he got annoyed because he played a really long record.  I don't recognize the song, so in the middle of it, he just pops the mic on.  He's like, this motherfucking song is goddamn too long.  This motherfucker is so goddamn long, I could've gone downstairs and got a shot of back.  Rambling on with more music.  By the way, my buddy Stork, who gave me the tape, he said that he said, get a shot of Mac, 
[02:59:00]  not back.  Yeah.  And it is a heroin or a drug thing.  So, that's what I didn't know.  This motherfucker is so goddamn long, I could've gone downstairs and got a shot of back.  Rambling on with more music.  Iron Butterfly.  Soul Experience.  Speed Kills. 
[02:59:30]  Slow Down.  You'll say I'll never live slow.  Smoke grass.  Smoke grass.  Just underground shit, man.  Not government radio.  That's extraordinary.  And nobody, what's amazing is that I am just hearing about it this morning.  Yeah.  I never heard of this guy.  Nope.  Never heard of him.  No.  And I had friends there.  One more clip before we give you a couple new ones. 
[03:00:00]  This is, I think, the one we finally love about the shit.  Iron Butterfly.  Soul Experience.  Lifers are like flies.  They both eat shit and bother people.  Thank you, Pete.  What delivery this fucking dude has. 
[03:00:30]  He's great.  This guy was having a ball.  And bother people.  And bother people.  Finally.  Bother me.  Finally, new clips.  Because people have been with us all morning.  These three clips are for XM only, man.  Talking about the hand jobs, the blow jobs.  Here's more of Dave Rabbit from 1970, 1971 when he was in Vietnam doing underground radio for everybody. 
[03:01:00]  Tonight's news comes from both Saigon and the Phan Rang areas.  First off, from Saigon.  We find that the new massage houses recently opened up near the Korean tailor shop.  The following services are available.  Steam bath, back massage, hand jobs, and blow jobs.  Hours are from 0700 hours for maggots, 7 a.m. for first termers, until 1630 hours for maggots, and 430 p.m. for first termers. 
[03:01:30]  Reservations may be made by calling the extension 2269.  Wow.  And now from Phan Rang area, here's Nugent.  The Nugent flights have been reopened and have a new champagne flight that leaves Phan Rang at 8 a.m.  It will operate on a first come, first go basis.  The commander also recommends that you take an ample supply of rubbers as they have a shit pot full of new whores at the bars.  The commander's motto, keep morale high on the base. 
[03:02:00]  And that's the news for this early edition.  Wow.  Next news will be later on.  Next local news will be later on, too.  Good night, Nugent.  Good night, Dave.  And good night for this early edition of Radio First Termer News.  Wow.  A shit pot.  Right at the end there, with the news, he cuts his signal.  So every time he does the news thing, he goes right into static, and then before it cuts out and goes dead.  Why?  He just, he only broadcasts for a certain amount of hours a day. 
[03:02:30]  So I guess when he does the news, it's pretty much towards the end of his broadcast, and then he just flips the switch and his signal goes dead.  Wow.  It sounds like he did it yesterday.  It sounds, it's more modern than what the shit we have to listen to now.  Well, yeah.  That's great.  Then you got Howard saying he invented this whole thing.  Obviously, this shit was being done a long time ago.  You gotta acknowledge the people that came before you, man.  Holy crap, this guy was an original.  Yeah.  I wonder if he ever had a real radio career after he got back from the war. 
[03:03:00]  I rocked him?  Yeah, I don't know.  Maybe he went by another name and was kind of doing more legit shit.  I don't know.  No, who would know is, get Stupid Abrams on the phone.  Lee.  You know Lee Abrams?  Yeah.  Stupid Abrams.  He bores us with his stories, but we'll give it a shot today.  But he does know his shit.  He knows his shit.  That's what I'm getting at.  He does know his shit.  He just bores you.  That's all he knows, though.  Don't ask him about flying.  Holy crap.  Yeah.  Oh, my God. 
[03:03:30]  Here's Dave Rabbit's philosophy.  And he does theater listings.  I can only imagine what movies he's reviewing here.  Here's the Dave Rabbit philosophy.  Pussy is the breakfast of champions.  Well, it's time to take a look and see what's happening at the Viking Theater at Van Rang.  The theaters at Saigon, the Trang, and the Cam'ron Bay Area.  Tonight, the movie is Lust, Sex, and Greed. 
[03:04:00]  Starring Bridget Bardot, Samantha Abbott, Tim Conway, Jonathan Winters, and Hugo Montenegro.  The following night is Bambi, a Walt Disney production of A Little Deer and How He Got Shafted.  The next one is A Fear and Chills as the blood of Dracula rolls down on all the patrons.  Here's a chance to really throw some money away.  Wow.  My fucking favorite, this guy. 
[03:04:30]  This guy is great.  Right on.  Grab a good game.  You want more or what?  Yes.  All right.  Of course.  Here's another quickie from the latrine.  The carnival act of sex is held to be sacred.  Eating pussy is perversion.  Signed, Omar.  Someone wrote under this.  Something happened in here.  Omar died from syphilis of the tongue and throat. 
[03:05:00]  Oh, God.  Ladies and gentlemen, say good evening to Buffalo Springfield.  Wow.  Hey, that's a cool way to intro a record right there.  That's pretty fucking cool, man.  This guy's amazing.  Yeah.  Fucking cool.  You know what?  Fucking, let's play the rest of this shit.  It's really good.  It really is.  We got just a few more.  We'll play the one from earlier, the public service announcement.  They got fucking, there's no clips of this guy anywhere? 
[03:05:30]  We're finding more.  There's more online.  Iraq's going through it tonight.  We should have more tomorrow, hopefully.  Only because I heard that you can always get his stuff in Albany on Friday night at the  Egg.  Oh, shit, Jimmy.  I fell right for it.  What?  Yeah, the Egg in Albany.  I'm a fucking rookie.  Man, I thought it was a good one.  And one night did they get an extra's in.  Really?  Well, this Friday, apparently, they're giving a lot of the money.  I happen to be there, but it's irrelevant.  You're going to have copies of the Dave Rabbit tape for everybody?  Oh, yeah, for free.  And the t-shirt.  518-473-1845.  45. 
[03:06:00]  Wow.  Now people are calling.  Look at my shirt.  Yeah, we got to get those shirts printed.  My brother could probably rip them off.  Not give them all the money.  I'm blowing a little grass now.  I'm not going back in.  Listen to music by Steppenwolf called The Pusher.  Speaking of The Pusher, brothers and sisters, if you happen to be down by the Magic Finger  Lounge in your time tonight, keep away from the Korean at the front door. 
[03:06:30]  He's pushing some bad H.  Wow.  I repeat, he's pushing some bad H.  Wow.  It's stunning.  And you figure, and he's the source of information.  Well, they had the real information, and then you had this guy that was more of a street  guy.  But it's also, it's that whole way, you know, back then of getting information.  Because nobody, the real information, they're not going to tell you that the H is bad. 
[03:07:00]  The H is bad.  The H is bad.  They don't even acknowledge that their troops are doing H.  Yeah, they're going to tell you, ah, avoid the fish.  You know, we've got a bad shipment.  Avoid the H.  You're right.  And the cream sauce.  Right, and the cream sauce.  It'll linger be bit.  You're getting your information from a guy who's in the back of a whorehouse.  That's where you've got to get, it's like nothing has changed in this country.  They're getting their information from, you know, us, and we're like two steps away.  I don't know anything. 
[03:07:30]  Where's Lee?  I don't know Mike, so they think we know because it comes out of the radio.  I heard it.  No, I heard it on the radio.  Oh, then it must be true.  No, we said it.  Where's Lee Abrams?  Steve left a voicemail for him.  We're trying to find him.  Yeah.  He's in an email somewhere.  Do you get the emails?  That's where he is.  Yeah, I get the blogs.  Are you friends with him or something?  Well, because I did a bunch of stuff for XM very early.  Back in the day, right?  Back in the day.  When there was 100 people listening.  When there was 60.  Sorry, but. 
[03:08:00]  Oh, no, it's true.  And then I got on and there was 102.  Yeah.  All right, we'll play more of this.  You left a, I don't have his email address.  My favorite is they gave me the XM box and all the stuff to actually  listen to you guys.  Right.  And it doesn't work.  Well, don't say that, Louis.  We're trying to, you know.  Well, it doesn't.  I'm trying to make people think that this is actually good.  It is good, but it doesn't work.  Whatever they gave me doesn't work.  And then they told me it was because of where I was located.  And I said, well, I thought a satellite can just get it to you. 
[03:08:30]  No, you need kind of line of sight.  You know, it doesn't go through ceilings or anything.  But I was like on the 40th floor.  How much higher do I need to be?  I'm like kissing the satellite's ass.  It's got to be like outside, the antenna.  What are they giving it to us?  Are you still in the same building on the west side?  I moved.  But I'm still in your neighborhood.  You still in the neighborhood?  No.  All right.  You out?  I moved to a richer one.  Did you?  Where are you living? 
[03:09:00]  145th Street and Edgecombe.  Edgecombe?  Not that.  All right.  Someone's got you?  Someone's got to turn this text thing off before I...  Uh-oh.  My love, what's the matter?  Do you know how to turn the fucking...  They're trying to guess what you're thinking?  Fucking text.  Predictive text.  Oh, yes, I do.  I'm ready to throw this.  I love predictive text.  I'm trying to get stupid Lee Abrams on the goddamn radio show.  All right, let me see.  Do me a favor.  Open up to the text page and I'll show you how to do it.  I don't know where that is.  When you're going to send a text.  No, I mean an email. 
[03:09:30]  It's in the email.  Wow, this is radio at its most fascinating.  All right, we've got more Dave Rabbit, though.  How do you text?  How do you text?  We've got more Dave Rabbit.  If you could call in and help us learn how to text, that would be really great for us.  Give you a prize.  Cutting edge radio, I don't know how to do this.  Hey, give it to Danny.  Danny would do it.  He tried all morning.  Like the stupid buttons started pushing themselves in my pocket.  My penis must have hit it or something.  Oh, yeah, boy, that giant penis.  I'm going to say yummy.  I got a giant penis. 
[03:10:00]  Don't make fun of my penis.  You're a big package.  It's not as big as Anthony's, but I do okay.  Suck this cock.  Are you packing, Lewis?  Not this morning.  I think you're probably...  I leave mine in the fridge.  I say Lewis is probably five and three quarters.  You don't have a six thing.  I'm thinking he's all ball.  No.  One giant ball.  Old taffy bag.  Old taffy bag.  Like a hornet's nest.  No, I have detachable.  I don't understand why you guys haven't moved to that.  Detachable penises?  Yeah.  I leave it in the fridge. 
[03:10:30]  And I pick it up when I get home.  Now that it smells like the Chinese food you left next to it.  Let's go back to Dave Rabbit.  Oh, man.  More Dave Rabbit.  Here's another saying from the latrine walls.  If you're sitting down taking a grab and reading this,  you're probably the only motherfucker in the Republic of Vietnam  that knows what he's doing.  All right.  Here's one that cuts your stereo full blast.  Then blow that motherfucker out in the next room.  Aha. 
[03:11:00]  Hendrix.  Fire.  He's talking over the vocals, though.  He doesn't know how to hit the post.  Hendrix.  Fire.  Well, first of all, that song's two minutes long,  so maybe you should just shut up on that one.  Oh, sorry.  He's a legend.  I like him.  Hendrix.  And now for a word from good old Pete.  He's got some information for some of you people out there.  Pete, what do you got for us tonight, buddy?  Thank you, Dave. 
[03:11:30]  As it is our policy to keep our listeners well informed,  we have a special news item that should be of special interest  for the patrons of the Castle Club this evening.  We have just learned of an MP raid at 10 p.m.,  or I should say 10.30 p.m. tonight.  So if I were you, ditch the grass, age, speed,  and make yourself plenty scarce.  Thank you, Dave.  Thank you, Pete, for those wise words.  And I would take heed to what Pete says. 
[03:12:00]  He hangs around at all these joints out there,  and he knows.  He's the knows that knows,  if you can dig what I'm saying.  I could dig it.  Was anyone fighting over there?  It sounded like they were having a great time.  They were just hanging out in whorehouses,  doing H, listening to Hendrix.  That's not a bad life right there.  He had some kind of connection  where he would reveal where officers  were maybe dining out for the evening. 
[03:12:30]  Oh, shit.  And any time the MPs were going to set a drug bust  or a surprise inspection,  they'd get the information,  start broadcasting right away,  right as the MPs are heading to wherever the troops are.  Wow.  All right, we got another clip.  What, warn the troops?  Yeah.  We got, oh, he does a dedication to the U.S. Army.  I can only imagine what this sounds like.  Instant request line.  Spencer Davis Group.  I'm a man. 
[03:13:00]  This is a dedication to the United States Army.  Army sucks.  That was called in by General Creighton W.A.  Oh, man.  Holy shit.  Called in by General Creighton.  Was he in the service?  This guy?  I mean, was he just, did he just show up?  He was in there for a year  and then was discharged or released  because they screwed up his paperwork. 
[03:13:30]  So he was labeled as something called a 1H,  which he asked what was,  and they said it's classified, we can't tell you.  Classified.  So he did a year and then was released,  but decided to hang around and do this radio station.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That's amazing.  Oh, so he was in Army when this was happening?  No, he had already served his time.  Oh, cool.  I bet you, I wonder if he's afraid of saying who he really is  because he's afraid that his Army pension or something  will be affected, his military pension.  Yeah.  Here's another quickie from the latrine wall  in the Republic of Vietnam. 
[03:14:00]  This joker writes,  18 days until I can go home  to picket and protest  this fucking waste of human lives  that lifers and the government call a war.  Hoss Cartwright  is a fairy  signed  his mother.  Oh, shit. 
[03:14:30]  Signed  his mother.  Wow.  He like, just,  he knows how to twist that shit, right?  It's good.  It's so solid.  Nice anti-military commie this guy was.  No kidding, man.  Let's find him.  Can you wait to play a clip?  I'm going to pee.  Yeah, let's, uh,  we'll take a break.  So that's it for today.  I think we did all our clips.  We're going to try to find more,  you rock?  Good quality?  All right.  We'll hopefully have more tomorrow.  We'll continue down this road  with Dave Rabbits  from the big 69. 
[03:15:00]  I got to track him down today.  That's great.  And the hits just keep on coming.  Coming.  Hendrix,  I know he's singing,  but, uh,  I'm high.  There's one other guy  that's,  I'm wondering what,  you could have to ask Abrams,  but there's,  there's another guy  who had that kind of a voice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  In the,  in the seventies and,  um,  yeah.  Back that,  that,  that style.  When I first started in,  um,  I think I've told the story  a couple of times,  but when I first started radio, 
[03:15:30]  I was just a schmuck.  I was like the E-Rock  back in the day.  And, uh,  and one of my jobs,  I had to like find all these old,  uh,  DJs from WCMF in Rochester.  They were doing like their 20th anniversary  or 25th anniversary,  something like that.  And I had to contact all these people.  They knew where they lived,  I guess.  And they,  uh,  I had to try to get all their air checks  and they sent air checks.  Every day I'm opening up my mail  and finding like this,  this amazing shit.  And all these guys  were just so fucking high,  just babbling about nothing. 
[03:16:00]  They're like,  they're talking about how they're just  looking out the window  and watching the snowfall.  Like they were,  they weren't giving you any info.  They were just hanging  in between the records.  I,  I think I got some of those,  uh,  those tapes as well.  I got to find them,  but there you go.  Louis Black,  uh,  the big promotion there,  Louis,  what are you promoting again?  Uh,  Root of All Evil,  Comedy Central,  March 12th.  It'll be advertised so much  by the time it comes on,  you'll think you've already seen it.  You'll go,  why am I going to watch it tonight?  Yeah,  so you don't even have to be here.  You're just,  uh,  hanging.  Because you're a friend.  Yeah. 
[03:16:30]  And because I need the abuse.  This is good therapy,  right?  Uh,  you know,  once you,  you know,  I saw my,  you know,  you know,  we did,  let's go after this,  but my father celebrated  his 90th birthday on Monday.  Wow.  Holy shit.  Congratulations.  My,  uh,  my mother calls it overtime.  How old's your mom?  She's 89.  Oh my God.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's great.  And they're still fucking with me.  Fucking?  Fucking with me.  Oh,  oh,  oh,  oh,  oh,  sorry.  I don't even want to,  I don't even want to think about that. 
[03:17:00]  That's just,  it was terrifying enough thinking about it,  about it years ago.  Yeah.  But it was pretty,  it was a wild party.  Yeah.  It was actually pretty much fun.  Yeah.  Is he still with it?  Yeah,  he's still with it,  and she's really with it.  She's like scary with it.  What's the big thing he still does  that you brag about?  Um,  he is,  um,  I love when they,  like,  they talk about,  like,  people celebrating their 100th birthday,  like,  and,  and she still does crossword puzzles?  Well,  he still drives.  Wow.  So that's the one you brag about. 
[03:17:30]  90 and driving.  90 and driving,  and I go in,  and every time I,  I'm down there,  like,  I've seen him three or four times a year,  and I'll get in the car with him  and go,  okay,  drive.  Let's see if you can really still do this.  Oh my God,  you're brave.  That's not something you should,  like,  experiment with.  He's good.  Can you drive?  He's really good.  He's,  seriously,  because it's like,  he is totally focused.  That's,  I think,  he said,  that's the toughest one  would be giving up driving,  but,  but they do back roads.  They don't ever get on a highway.  They do like,  you know,  they get on the, 
[03:18:00]  it takes them like,  you know,  50 minutes to get somewhere  that's probably 15 minutes away.  Yeah,  it's a five minute ride,  but it's,  it's their,  that's what they do for that day.  But his thing was,  the,  that's their event for the day.  My father's big on cleavage.  My father really loves cleavage.  Yeah?  Well,  we were,  he's,  they'd gone to,  they did a,  you know,  a cruise,  they're on a cruise ship.  They're in Puerto Rico.  And my mother calls us  about a couple of years ago.  And I say,  how's,  how's the trip,  pop?  He goes, 
[03:18:30]  the trip is good,  but the cleavage is excellent.  And he was a mechanical engineer  and the,  it's,  you know,  he said,  he was sitting around with Danny.  He goes,  you know,  the only thing I regret,  he said,  I think I should have come up  with an instrument  for measuring,  cleavage.  He said,  I believe that's the most important.  He said,  not the,  the total measurements  don't matter as much  as the cleavage matters.  Are you a fan of cleavage?  Not,  not as much as he is.  I like cleavage.  He's from a different era though  where you couldn't just see 
[03:19:00]  tits and box all over the place  so cleavage was the turn on.  You'd see a little bit  of naughty cleavage.  That was hardcore shit back then.  That was like seeing  the brown eye,  right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Seeing cleavage back in the 40s  was like seeing somebody  shit in somebody else's mouth  in a wedding dress.  Oh man,  just,  wow.  Oh my God.  He makes a good point though,  Lois.  I mean,  you got to give it to him  on that one.  He certainly did.  I hate to find out  my dad's a big scat movie fan.  Two girls,  one cup.  Have you seen  two girls,  one cup?  I've seen two girls,  one cup.  Oh,  that's fantastic.  Really.  Are you sure? 
[03:19:30]  Are you just like,  oh,  yeah,  have I seen it?  Yes.  Okay.  You would not make that up.  All right.  Why would you even begin to make it?  Have you seen Mr. Hands?  No,  that I've not seen.  You want to see Mr. Hands today?  Sure,  why not?  Have you seen Meat Spin?  No,  I've not seen Meat Spin.  Lemon Party?  Lemon Party?  No.  You look like one of the guys  from Lemon Party.  I don't,  I feel like one of the guys.  You certainly act like  all three of them.  You want to see Lemon Party  real fast before we take a break?  Sure.  It's actually sexy.  You sure?  It's actually,  if he thinks it's sexy,  I can't wait to see it. 
[03:20:00]  It's extremely good.  Yeah,  I bet it is.  It's one of our favorite videos.  Yeah.  Well,  there he is.  Well,  it should be beat watching  Tim Russell.  All right,  turn around,  turn around,  Lewis,  so you can see Lemon Party.  No,  over here.  Over here?  Yeah,  this Lemon Party.  Excellent.  Wow.  So the question we ask  every person that  checks out Lemon Party,  which guy would you rather be?  Wow.  If you had to be  one of the guys,  which one?  I'd be the one  kissing the guy.  That's it. 
[03:20:30]  That's as far as I'm going.  That's all I want to do.  See,  we're thinking  if you're actually kissing,  that's what makes it gay.  No,  no,  no.  Like that guy,  he's just looking for a snack.  You mean the sucking the cock  is nothing.  That's not gay.  I think the...  Your definition of gay  may be clinically insane.  I think the kissing  of another guy,  there's like a little love involved  and that makes it a bit gay.  No,  I think the sucking of the cock  is a bit gay. 
[03:21:00]  That's a little gay.  That's fruitless.  More gay than kissing a man  and feeling his whiskers and stuff.  Well,  I'll tell you this,  the mob guys kiss each other.  Not like that,  Lewis.  Yeah,  they do.  Like that?  Yes.  Okay.  Pull out each other's cock?  No,  that's a different thing.  Okay.  No,  I'm not sucking my cock.  I hope my cock sucks.  Why?  I don't have it.  I don't.  But wait,  Lewis,  let's look at the dicks.  Logically.  You close your eyes,  you don't know that's a guy. 
[03:21:30]  You don't know that Arnold Palmer  looking dude is a guy.  Yeah,  you do.  How?  If your eyes are closed.  Your brain goes,  it's a guy!  Okay?  That's how you know.  Just like that,  huh?  Yeah,  and it does it over and over again.  No,  it doesn't.  All right,  we're going to take a break.  I think we got Mythbusters guys  calling in,  right?  Oh,  I have some myths  that I'd like to ask questions about. 
[03:22:00]  Ooh.  What am I going to have to get going?  Why?  You can't go.  You can never go.  You got like an audition.  No,  no audition.  Lewis is off for only.  Yeah,  what do you got,  Lewis?  No,  I just moved into this place  and I got to get back to this.  Where's Florian?  I'm on the 6th.  Oh,  is it that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Fucking nice new,  right?  Yeah.  Aw.  Wait.  How many bed?  Two.  Are you renting or buying?  No.  Did you buy?  You're over there.  Did you buy or you're renting?  I bought.  Oh,  finally.  I didn't know they sold in that building. 
[03:22:30]  About time.  Jesus.  Yep.  Cool.  It's a good location.  Did you get a 30-year mortgage?  Whatever it is,  I don't know.  Oh,  wow.  Just pay cash.  You think I know anything?  Fucking pay cash.  You're Lewis Black.  Two gigs your apartment paid for.  That's right.  Selling out all over the place.  I guess you're not a fan of Mythbusters.  That's why you're leaving.  I'll make sure I tell the guys.  According to Lewis,  it stinks in its shit.  That'll be good.  All right.  I'm not going to stay around to go,  though.  I'm a fan of Mythbusters.  I really am.  No,  seriously.  You really got to go?  What are you doing? 
[03:23:00]  Yeah.  No,  I got to go back.  Is it really a house thing?  I literally just moved in,  and I have had no fucking time to deal with moving in.  I got back a week ago from doing all this shit,  and I want to actually move into the place  before I have to go fucking leave again.  When are we doing sushi?  We're going to do sushi Thursday.  Really?  No,  I'm lying.  Oh,  okay.  I got excited.  No,  I'm around this.  I'm around.  You're around for a while?  Yes.  I leave next week,  but then I'm back for the week.  We'll do it. 
[03:23:30]  We'll fucking make a date to do it.  All right,  and if you want me to join you in...  What?  My ears are not garbage cans.  Wow.  God.  Don't they afternoon?  What is cursing?  My ears are not garbage cans.  That's so funny.  And I'll join you in your alcoholism if it's a Friday.  I can't drink during the week.  But Friday,  I'll join you for some of that fine red wine.  Okay.  No,  it's the place right down on 58th.  What is it?  The sushi joint?  Yeah.  Not the one you used to go to.  Patsy's.  Oh,  the new place you said we got to check it out. 
[03:24:00]  Is it good?  It's great.  You ever eat sushi Nizawa?  In LA?  No,  only,  no.  I've tried to come up with a joke.  I fucking nothing.  What?  No jokes with sushi Nizawa.  It's good.  Sushi Nizawa.  Nizawa.  I'll talk about it off the air.  Okay.  I can't sound like a bigger faggot than I do right now.  I'm sipping my fucking...  Yeah,  your Jamba juice.  My Jamba juice,  talking about sushi in La La Land.  Sushi.  Oh,  but the fish is to die for.  All right,  Andrew Heim.  Hello.  Denton, 
[03:24:30]  Denton,  Texas.  He never listens live.  He wants to hear his name.  There you go.  Lewis Black might be here.  We'll twist your arm.  We'll make you step.  Fuck you.  You got half a sandwich to still eat.  Right.  And some promotion to do.  I've got promotion.  Yeah,  this is going to get me over the edge.  Ah.  Now Wednesday.  Generally speaking,  the sight of the female breast  or contact with it  produces a sexually arousing reaction  in the male. 
[03:25:00]  And we're back.  Thanks.  With  the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi.  Hey,  we haven't had these guys on in a while.  It's Jamie and Adam from Mythbusters.  Hey,  guys.  Good morning.  Good morning to you.  Hi,  gentlemen.  Where are you guys calling from?  I'm in the rain on top of Twin Peaks  in San Francisco.  Nice.  Really?  Jimmy was just out there  doing a little comedy.  Oh,  yeah,  I was just out there.  Yeah.  It's a great city.  You live there? 
[03:25:30]  Yeah.  That's where they do a lot of their stuff.  Oh,  okay.  Yeah,  of course.  Yeah.  How do you guys feel  in the Esquimeth Busters?  They've been talking so much now  about dispelling the myths of Oswald  being the,  I'm sorry,  of the conspiracy actually  and actually pointing a lot more  towards Oswald being the lone assassin  and people saying,  well,  the things that they said  weren't possible actually were.  Do you guys have any take on that  or feelings about that?  You know,  one of the very earliest things we did  was called Ice Bullet.  It wasn't a second shooter  on the grassy knoll 
[03:26:00]  that was firing a bullet  made of ice that disappeared,  which is why they only found one bullet.  And I got to tell you,  doing that myth  brought out the crackpots.  The number of crackpot  and disturbing emails  that Jamie and I have gotten  over the years  is just huge.  Wait.  There might be some more material  in there,  certainly.  Wait.  The bullet just came out  as like water.  I never heard of the Ice Bullet theory.  Have you, Ant?  Yeah.  I haven't either.  I really haven't. 
[03:26:30]  I heard about the theory  where the guy was in the,  in the,  what, Jimmy?  The,  the,  the,  the,  the,  the,  the streets,  everywhere.  No, no,  in the hole.  In the car,  in the fucking manhole,  just the most nonsensical.  Or the,  or the fucking sewer.  Yeah,  the sewer where they lifted up  the cover a little bit,  the lid and shot,  and then they were gone.  Yeah,  that's how it happens.  That's one of my favorites,  boy.  You guys are celebrating  your 100th show,  right?  100th episode on,  what,  tonight on Discovery Channel,  9 o'clock.  Tonight on Discovery Channel  at 9 o'clock,  yeah.  Very cool. 
[03:27:00]  100 shows.  You guys are on over the years  and we keep trying to think  of myths that you guys  haven't tackled yet  and I think I finally got one.  All right,  go for it.  And I'm dead serious too.  You hear about like  world-class athletes,  right?  Yeah.  And they don't have sex  before like a big game  or mostly you heard about it  as far as fights go.  And I wonder if you guys  could do something  to actually see  if there is something  to do with having sex  before a big event.  I love that one. 
[03:27:30]  Well,  you understand  that this is a family show.  Of course,  if we were typical  to Mythbusters,  we'd have to do this  without mentioning  the word sex  or, you know,  what's involved with that.  It'd be a,  but we could still  pull it off.  Hold on,  you could do,  you couldn't mention sex  without doing a kind of,  the myth about having sex  the night before  about losing energy  and not being able  to perform physical tasks.  Right.  That's not dirty.  Well, actually,  you know,  one of the ones  that I wanted to do  is, you know,  how there's a star, 
[03:28:00]  like a sports star  that gets caught doping  or, you know,  some chemical in his butt  and he makes an excuse  like he says,  oh, you know,  I got a massage  with some kind  of steroidal cream.  Well, one of the things  I've always wanted  to do on the show  is we try  all of the different,  you know,  excuse methods  for giving a false positive  and see how reasonable  they are.  Ah, I like that.  Rat them out.  Yeah, absolutely.  You guys are working  on MacGyver myths?  Yeah, that's the one  on the plate tonight.  We finally start tackling 
[03:28:30]  Angus MacGyver  and his thing.  Yes, now MacGyver  always coming up  with wacky gadgets  and stuff made out  of nothing.  Well, that's us.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's pretty much  what you do.  What's one of the odd  things that MacGyver  came up with  that you guys  are trying to put together?  Well, one of the ones  on the upcoming episode  is that he supposedly  blew a hole in a wall  using, I believe  it was pure sodium 
[03:29:00]  in a little gelatin capsule  that dissolved in water,  you know, giving him  enough time  to put it in a bottle  and, you know,  get away before it blew up  and blew a hole in the wall.  And so, of course,  true to form with us,  we end up using  ridiculous quantities  of the metal  and making, you know,  taking it as far  as we can go.  Well, that's what I like.  If the myth doesn't  quite work  and it's busted,  they have to blow it up anyway.  Well, what I noticed  about the show  is that you guys  don't really take 
[03:29:30]  too many chances.  Well, you know,  it's kind of hard  not to.  I mean, we have had  our share of close calls  on the show  and we've learned  from that.  So, you know,  we do the best  that we can  to vet these things out  and at this point  we've done so much  of this  that we've got  a pretty good sense  of, you know,  like, if we feel  like running,  we're going to run.  Yeah, we've seen 
[03:30:00]  you guys on fire.  Commencer with that.  If you see us  on the street  and we're running,  you should follow us.  Yeah.  Oh, absolutely.  Now,  you know what surprised me  in one of the myths  you were busting?  It was that  vomit chair  that you sat  in the motion sickness chair.  How quickly  you guys got sick  from that.  Well, Adam got sick.  Yeah, Adam got sick  very quickly.  Yeah, man.  That chair,  like, I still get chills 
[03:30:30]  when I think about that one.  Do you get seasick  on boats?  You know,  I grew up  on the East Coast.  I spent a lot of time  in Cape Cod on boats  but never in anything  like Pacific Swells  or, you know,  real water.  And so we didn't find out  until we were shooting  the first Shark Week episode  that, yeah,  I am really prone  to getting seasick  on boats  on wavy water, man,  and it sucks.  Any good video of you  for the gag reel  of you puking over the side? 
[03:31:00]  It's not a gag reel.  It always makes it  into the show.  We were in South Africa  last year.  My wife is on the boat  and we're all filming  and my producer says  to the cameraman,  hey, Tim,  Adam's spilling.  And my wife thinks,  oh, that's sweet.  But then she realizes,  no, she just means  film him, film him.  Yeah, watching out for you.  Exactly.  That's true love,  though, right there.  Good thinking about it.  Hey, Mike Mariano  from Boston  has a good question.  I know you guys, like,  try to keep it fun and all, 
[03:31:30]  but I'm sure you've heard  all the 9-11 conspiracies.  Have you ever thought  of doing a show  on some of those  conspiracies with the building?  We totally have.  Oh, sorry, go ahead.  No, I was just going to say,  one of the problems  is that that's one  where we really like  to not just demonstrate concepts.  We like to prove it  to the people  who are the most resistant  to believing it.  And the problem with that  is figuring out the scale  to do it in  that's big enough  and convincing enough  to change the mind. 
[03:32:00]  Right.  You know,  and we have actually  talked back and forth  about that  over the years.  They don't have,  I mean,  Anthony and Jimmy,  they're really good  at talking to these people  and they just don't have  the answers  to the basic questions  of what happened that day  because they're really,  you know,  convinced that it was  an inside job.  And Anthony brings up  a great point  that they would have  to be drilling holes  for weeks on end  and no one's noticing  that this is going on  around them  in a work environment.  Yeah, absolutely right.  Yeah, I don't think 
[03:32:30]  people have seen  what it takes  to actually do  a controlled demolition  of a building.  They think you could  just go in one night  and plant some dynamite  around.  There's got to be  beams drilled out  and come alongs  pulling cable  and it's amazing.  I also think  you look at the  bureaucracies  that we have to deal  with and the various  quagmires our government  gets into  and you think  this is a government  capable of a conspiracy  that big?  Yeah, to that magnitude,  right?  Yeah, that isn't  going to happen.  One of the myths  we're working on 
[03:33:00]  right now  is busting  whether or not  the Apollo moon landing  was a hoax.  We've actually been  dealing directly  with conspiracy theorists  about this  and attacking  whether or not  the photos are  faked or fudged,  whether or not  the way the astronauts  move doesn't work right.  That's one we've been  wanting to do  for a long time.  Do you find them  to be rational  or are they just  irrational babies  who are trying  to prove a point  regardless of evidence?  That's often the case.  Yep.  You know,  whenever  these conspiracy theorists 
[03:33:30]  people are,  you know,  they don't,  we've ended up  getting feedback  when we've done  some of these things  where they  go ahead and list  all the reasons  that, you know,  they don't believe it  which, you know,  that we've done  which are the exact  same reasons  that we've used  to prove that it,  you know,  that this particular  thing was, you know,  was true or false.  It's, you know,  they don't,  they're not listening  to the evidence  that you're presenting  to them. 
[03:34:00]  They're just, you know,  hammering on  about their own idea.  Yeah, they basically,  they want to be a part  of it somehow  by proving it  or disproving it  and it's like,  the theory is  there's a conspiracy.  Now I have to prove it.  Like, instead of saying  let me look at the evidence  and be objected about it.  Right.  Exactly.  They're shitheads.  You're right.  And, Adam,  I must pass on  my condolences  to one of the first  people you worked with,  Mr. Whipple.  Oh, yeah.  I do remember  watching that video.  You ever see that one?  No, no, no. 
[03:34:30]  What's that?  Adam in,  please don't squeeze  the Charmin commercial.  No kidding.  He's a stock boy.  No kidding.  It's classic.  You look hysterical.  Yeah, even now  we have to work  to keep him out  of the bathroom  because he's in there  squeezing the Charmin.  It seems that Adam  burns himself  a lot more than Jamie.  You know,  it only seems like that  because I react so well.  The problem is  is that when Jamie  gets hurt,  he just stands there  and then says something like, 
[03:35:00]  that's horrible.  But I think he and I  get hurt just as much  as each other.  Yeah.  Whenever you're in  the shop itself  doing something  with even the littlest  bit of explosives,  I go,  oh, this isn't going  to be good.  You know,  when you're outside,  it's fine,  but in that little,  the confines of the  little shop,  it's a little dangerous.  We've actually had,  we've had various  city officials show up  after watching an episode  to come yell at us. 
[03:35:30]  Yeah, you can't do that.  Who else is,  who else is in that  like strip of,  because I assume  it's in an industrial  park?  Yeah, we're in  San Francisco proper.  It's not,  it's,  yeah, it's in a  light industrial area.  No.  It's not really  an office park.  It's a,  you know,  it's a reasonable  place for us to be  because we're located  right, you know,  where we can get  access to just about  anything really quickly  here.  But do you have  like neighbors  that are like  glove warehouse 
[03:36:00]  people or,  you know?  Well, yeah,  there's a little bit  of a problem  with the neighbors.  There was,  we've actually  got two shops  and, you know,  the second one  because I own  the building here  at where we  normally work at  and I've got  pigs buried  under my sidewalk.  You know,  we're out in front  of the shop  with people  driving by  and we're trying  to, you know,  do small explosions  and things.  It just wasn't  happening.  So we got  a second shop 
[03:36:30]  and the first thing  within about six months  we got kicked  out of that one  and, you know,  then we got  another one  that actually  is a little bit  at the end  of a cul-de-sac  so there's not  that many neighbors  around to complain.  Our neighbors  have a good sense  of humor  at this point.  We got a taxi  company,  a salami company,  an embroiderer,  an air conditioning  company and at this  point they all  know us,  they all know,  you know,  that if we're running  they should follow us  and...  Yeah, the salami 
[03:37:00]  company in particular  is kind of funny  because we end up  using salami,  like we've used  salami for the  rocket...  Right, the rocket  engine.  You know,  they're kind of  into it.  That looked like  you guys had to  do that again  because that kind  of looked like  it worked  but then there  was a little  controversy.  Yeah,  salami turned  out to be a  little more  energetic than  we thought  and, you  know,  I'd love to  have another  go at that  because I  think if we  handled it  properly,  we were having  problems as a 
[03:37:30]  rocket fuel  because it was  sort of blown  out as chunks  rather than  burning off  evenly.  Which was  really disgusting  looking,  by the way,  big chunks of  flaming salami  flying out of  the rocket.  Well,  the chunks  were clogging  the nozzle  and making  for the whole  thing to just  blow up  before it  got really  up there.  Well,  Jamie wants  to do rocket  powered by  like crushed  mice or  cockroaches.  Really?  Well,  and then there's  the rocket  like any other.  Yeah,  there's also  the rocket  powered by  poo.  And believe 
[03:38:00]  it or not,  NASA's actually  looked into  this because,  you know,  if you're out  there on your  way to Mars  or something  if you could  reuse,  it's not like  you're going  to recycle  your poo  back into  food or  something else  useful like  you can.  You could  probably  safely extract  water back  out of the  urine,  but the  poo,  they just  go,  well,  let's see  if it works  as rocket  fuel.  And the  fact is,  any hydrocarbon  handled in  the right way  would.  So I don't 
[03:38:30]  know how far  they pursued  that,  but they did  consider it.  That's  something.  Yeah,  absolutely.  And watching  you guys over  the years,  because I've  been a big  fan for a  lot of  years,  I absolutely  did not  think the  lead balloon  was going  to work.  Because,  you know,  your previous  record with  stuff like  that,  I mean,  your heart  and spirit  are there,  but somehow  it just  doesn't pan 
[03:39:00]  out.  But that  amazed me  that you  got that  much lead  off the  ground.  You know,  that's  absolutely  one of  our  all-time  favorite  episodes.  There's  no  explosions,  it's not  very fancy,  but in  terms of  the problem  solving and  the way we  kind of wrapped  our brain  around it and  made it work,  I mean,  both of  Jamie and I  were absolutely  thrilled by  doing it and  by the final cut.  It was great,  and, yeah,  Adam,  the method you  used to  untwist the  actual balloon  to keep the  weight from 
[03:39:30]  ripping itself  apart was  really ingenious.  That's  something.  It was,  again,  one of those  ones where  right up until  the moment it  happened,  we were totally  convinced it could  go either way.  Yeah.  And those are  the most fun to  do.  Are you guys  starting to run  out of ideas?  Like, how are  you going to keep  this successful  show going?  Oh, no.  Yeah, we're  still going strong.  I mean, the  show's about a  lot more than  just urban  legends, as  you can tell.  We get into  about anything  that we can  muck around 
[03:40:00]  with and get  challenged by.  And, I mean,  we're, basically,  if you look at  what the show  is doing, it's  the crazy stuff  where man meets  technology.  And, you know,  that's a really  deep well to,  you know, as a  source.  Yeah, it started  out pretty much  as urban  legend.  And then, you  know, you guys  delve into action  movies and the  myths that are  in action movies  and now MacGyver.  So, you  definitely have a  lot of subject  matter to cover.  Yeah, you're  certainly keeping  it going big 
[03:40:30]  time.  Hey, we talk  about this guy  on our show,  Stan Meyer.  Do you guys  know anything  about him?  The guy that  came up with  supposedly the  car that runs  with water?  Oh, yeah.  And then he  was killed by  the government  after he...  There's a rumor.  After he...  Yeah.  After it was  discovered that  he had this  invention.  Yeah, I think  it's...  Is it the  Joe cell that  he built?  I'm not sure.  Yeah, I'm pretty  sure that was  what it was  called.  Yeah, it just  ran on water.  I've got one  behind my desk.  They don't  work.  They don't work. 
[03:41:00]  It's a...  I built one to  the exact...  You know, this  was part of a  free energy episode,  I think about  30 or 40  episodes ago,  where we built  all these different  things from very  specific plans.  And, you know,  the plans for the  Joe cell are not  that complex,  and they describe  a very specific  and precise set of  parameters, and we  followed every one  of them, and it  doesn't work at all.  I like when you  get those ideas  and the, like,  free energy,  and you send,  it looks like,  in the back of 
[03:41:30]  an old magazine,  and you get, or  the internet, and  you get something  back, and I just  look and go,  why are they even  bothering assembling  this thing?  Yeah.  Well, there's an  old magazine.  I saw just the  other day in, you  know, a brand new  issue of Popular  Science, there's an  ad.  They want you to  spend a thousand  bucks for a device  that, among other  things, includes  something like a  Joe cell in there,  and it's just,  you know, that's  now.  Yeah.  So people are  still trying to  swindle people 
[03:42:00]  with that thing.  Stay away from  the free energy  experiments, please.  As we say on  the show, as long  as, and I can  finally say it on  your show, as long  as people believe  stupid shit, we  still got a job.  There you go.  Bravo.  There you go, man.  It's very similar to  what we do.  I can't see a  better line to  close with, guys.  Thanks so much.  Congrats, and  looking forward to  the MacGyver  episode.  Yeah, tonight at  nine on the  Discovery Channel, 
[03:42:30]  the hundredth  episode for you  guys.  Thanks for having  us on, guys.  Cool.  We'll see you guys  soon, all right?  Later.  We'll talk soon.  Later, guys.  Jamie and Adam,  everyone.  Yeah, they're good  guys.  They've been friends  of the show for a  long time.  Yeah.  I love that show.  I get pissed off  when I'm going  around the channels,  and it's one I've  seen already, but  occasionally you get  one, and then...  And they're not  running out of ideas.  That's great.  No, no, and you  thought they would,  because it was  just urban legends  at first, but they  kind of figured out  how to keep it going  with other...  If you get a hit  show, they figure  out how to fucking  keep it going as  long as possible. 
[03:43:00]  Exactly.  But now they're  delving into movies  and TV shows and  things like that.  Yeah, yeah.  They should go...  You know what  they should do?  I wanted to tell  them this.  Like, all these  crazy...  Mythbusters meets  Jackass?  No, I did want  to tell them about  that.  I think that's  called Smash Lab.  We forgot to ask  about Smash Lab.  No, like, and I  wasn't even joking.  Like, the sex before  a big sporting event,  and I'm sure there's  some other edgy,  like, you know,  this is a family  type show, but maybe  they could do an  offshoot, either do  a DVD or throw it 
[03:43:30]  on Showtime or HBO.  Could you see...  But doing some of  these other ones.  But Adam, I could  see, could you see  Jamie like, well,  this person is going  to fuck, and we  are going to then  measure how much  energy he lost  after the act.  He just doesn't  seem like that type.  He's really Mr.  Science.  I would have gave  credit to the Stan  Meyer question, but  you didn't leave  your name, buddy.  Oh, that was good,  yeah.  Cell phone and  some feedback.  We like giving  credit, so if you're  feedbacking from a  cell phone, just  throw your name in  there. 
[03:44:00]  SkiColoradoNow.com.  That's right, we're  up to line of the  day.  For info on great  deals on 26 world  class resorts and up  to the minute snow  conditions, log on to  SkiColoradoNow.com.  Here is a runner-up  line of the day.  Yeah, that would  have been fine.  Simon says, put your  hands over your head.  Oh, I'm sorry, Mr.  McCain.  You're out.  Dave Rabbit is now  number 15 on Google  Trends, and we didn't  even ask for a Google  bomb today. 
[03:44:30]  Wow.  That's how much  interest there was in  Dave Rabbit today.  Wow, we were on to  something, huh?  That's pretty impressive.  Thank you, Dante Hicks,  for letting us know  about that.  Dave Rabbit.  Dante Hicks?  Yeah.  All right.  Who is that?  I'm not even going to  pretend.  Is that a...  Clerks?  I'm not supposed to be  here.  Yeah.  I'm not supposed to be  here.  His last name's Hicks,  too?  Dante.  Yeah.  Well, I know Dante.  Yeah.  Okay, I didn't know.  It wasn't a Hicks?  Yeah.  Okay.  Oh, fuck.  You got me on that.  Dante fucking faggot. 
[03:45:00]  Dave Rabbit or David  Rabbit?  Dave Rabbit.  Dave, I think.  Dave Rabbit on Google  Trends.  That's pretty cool, man.  That means that people  were very interested in  hearing him today.  Hopefully, we'll have  more tomorrow and maybe  an interview with the  guy.  I don't know about the  interview, though, because  E-Rock's trying, and it  just seems like he's a  little leery or something.  I don't know.  We'll find out later.  Here's another runner-up  line of the day.  Certain part you have that 
[03:45:30]  disgusts him.  Yes, that makes him go,  ew.  He looks at that the way  most of us look at  garbage juice.  He's at the bottom of  the truck.  Very good.  Vagina.  And garbage juice.  Yeah, I thought of that  because I was on my way  into the cab, and the  garbage truck was off to  the side, and they were  crushing bags, and some  orange stuff just burst and  started to shoot out of  the bag.  It must have been like a  full container of orange  juice.  Yeah.  Dude, my rat book, that's, you 
[03:46:00]  know, that attracts the rats.  All that garbage juice.  No shit, they love it.  When a fucking, like, what  rat book do you have?  When a truck runs over a  bag of fucking garbage and  you get all that juice.  Oh, the juice.  Oh, man, the rats are  alerted.  Why don't rats go to  good?  Good rat juice.  How do rats never just go,  that's terrible, I don't want  to eat that.  They're amazing creatures.  The book is, it's all  right.  What's the book called?  I think it's just called  rats.  The cover is Manhattan in  the shape of a rat.  Oh. 
[03:46:30]  It's pretty much in.  Is it pictures of rats?  No.  But they explain them and  it's pretty interesting  stuff.  I want to look at pictures  of rats.  I don't know what to do.  That's scary.  Who's that guy?  Who's what guy?  I don't know.  Did he come to kill us?  Who the fuck was that?  I don't know anything about  anything.  Here's another runner-up  line of the day.  Can you tell that he only  had one testicle?  Yeah.  Because it's on the  side of his face.  But in photos, they  airbrush it out. 
[03:47:00]  Good old Louis Black.  Fucking miss him, man.  We got to get some of the  old friends back on this  goddamn radio show.  Well, if there's a merger,  hopefully it would be great  to have Brewer come back  on.  It would be great to have  Jim Brewer.  Brewer, class act.  I was talking about Brewer  over the weekend.  Oh, yeah.  What was he up to?  No, I didn't talk to...  I actually...  I did text him one night  drunk and he...  And then my phone rang.  But no one was there.  So I think we were  sort of trying to  communicate, but I think  we're both a little scared.  Yeah.  Because he works for them.  Works for the enemy. 
[03:47:30]  I was talking about him  because a lot of people,  they leave this radio show  to do other things and  they fucking turn their  back on us, which just  amazes me still.  Whatever.  But not whatever.  It really pisses me off.  But the thing I have to say  about Brewer, we had a  heart-to-heart.  XM wanted him.  Sirius gave him a better  offer.  He kind of wanted to do  his own thing.  He didn't want to be under  our shadow.  And he's doing his own  thing.  He's very successful.  And not once did he have  to fucking badmouth us to  get stuff going.  Yeah.  Going.  Well, Jim was actually 
[03:48:00]  also there before...  What a class act, man.  He was there before this  show signed, too.  Like, you know what I mean?  Remember, Jim went to  Sirius before...  It was close.  Yeah.  It was close, because we  were, like, all negotiating  at the same time, going  back and forth.  But he's a class act, because  he didn't have to go down  that road.  No.  Talks nicely about us when  it comes up, and that's  it.  He does his thing.  All the guys, like,  remember Scott Farrell?  He used to be a friend of  the show.  He turns his back like that  as soon as he's not  associated with us anymore.  Ah, Gab.  And the list is fucking  long as hell. 
[03:48:30]  The latest being you-know-who,  the old fucking producer.  That's smart.  Trash everyone just before  you want to try to get  something going in  radio.  They're dope.  You and your family.  Here's another runner-up  line of the day.  I've been pansy to do  the weather here every  day.  Yeah.  Steve?  No, that's general.  He's been promoted.  He sure has.  I've gotten a promotion.  General fruit.  I'm a four-star pansy.  Let's go.  He's got new stripes on his 
[03:49:00]  knee pads.  I got gold clusters, but  they turned out to be  warts.  All right.  Steve Gay jokes.  I didn't mean that.  I was just kidding.  I have to admit something.  Oh, no.  When was that break?  Oh, that was over at  CBS.  I hear myself laughing.  I don't remember that.  Was that from another show?  Holy shit. 
[03:49:30]  And I'm trying to listen  better, too.  Wow.  Sometimes you're in the  middle of doing something  and you look up and  miss something and you  listen to the replay.  Or you're thinking,  sometimes I'm trying to  think of a good line and  I'm missing the other  ones that come out and  then it's real good when  you then repeat one line  that came out while you  were thinking of a line.  Well, it's tough because  we're all doing our thing  and trying to listen at  the same time and  sometimes those worlds  collide into a fucking  clusterfuck. 
[03:50:00]  Thanks, Bill Kay, for  whatever.  I don't know.  Thank you, Blue Heeler.  All right, we'll do this  today.  Scott Bryan from Indy.  Thank you.  Instant feedbackers.  Paul Shirehorst from  Bohemia.  What's that?  What a comfortable,  nice name that is.  Jason Mattowski.  The Shirehorst for  arriving shortly.  The Shirehorst.  Happy anniversary,  Mr. Shirehorst.  How about Jason Mattowski?  That's why I would 
[03:50:30]  never be a good teacher.  I wouldn't be able to  pronounce half the  fucking names in the  class.  Hector V from Georgia.  You got Mike Hawk from  Michigan.  You got Craig Sorelli from  Scranton, PA.  Nick C from Pittsburgh.  Conspiracy Nuts in Toledo.  Hoffman.  And that's it.  I turn off the screen.  Is that line of the  daytime?  Jimmy and Albany at the  egg.  Get your fucking ticket so  we don't have to listen to  him plug.  Please.  Here's your line of the  day.  Please. 
[03:51:00]  Here comes the  line of the day.  Line of the day.  I had it down to my  little tiny letters.  I had it down to my  thumb.  Wow.  A piece of paper down to  my thumb.  Wow.  What did you write on  the back of a list of  E-Rock's accomplishments?  Oh, I heard that one  today.  You're going to have to do 
[03:51:30]  a little Dave Rabbit, I'm  thinking, after line of the  day.  Maybe the hits keep on  coming.  Yeah.  The Shire Horse will be defeated  with my  I finally saw Harry Potter and  the curse of the Shire  Horses.  Whatever the fuck the name is.  Shire Horse.  Shire Horse.  I think he's jealous because  he sold more Harry Potter books  than he did.  Ladies and gentlemen, Lord and 
[03:52:00]  Lady Shire Horse.  You have to do hard T at the  end.  Shire Horse.  Shire Horse.  Because there is a T in his  name.  Shire Horse.  Shire Horse.  Jeremy asks, what about you?  Now go fuck yourself,  Cleveland.  Excuse me, but that  knock horse belongs to  Mr.  Mrs.  Shire Horse.  Oh, he did the hard T, too.  I saw that, the latest  Harry Potter movie, because I  kind of like the Harry Potter 
[03:52:30]  movies.  I hate them.  Well, the first one was very  kid-like, but then they got a  little darker and cooler, but  the last one sucked balls, man.  Of course it did.  Sucked balls.  All right, I edit a lot today.  I did, though.  I brought in a tape for  everyone's enjoyment.  That was a good one.  I got to find more stuff.  Know what's coming next?  The Real Rock TV tapes.  I found them.  They're in a bag.  Oh, no.  They're in a plastic shopping  bag that hasn't been open in 
[03:53:00]  10 years, Anthony.  I got them.  I got every fucking episode.  Oh, no.  I don't want to hear them.  And we're going to have to go  through some of the bits  that we do for that show.  Can we do enough damage to our  reputation with the blimp?  F-U, A-B-U, I hate you.  What are you guys doing  dressed in camouflage?  That was the worst.  Rocco acting.  Well, I got to give it to him.  He had a bit of sarcasm.  We still didn't understand that  word in our careers.  Yeah, you're all dressed in 
[03:53:30]  camouflage.  And I was taking them literally.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  Isn't it cool?  Yeah.  Do you guys cut, like, just cut out  the nonsense at the end of every show  to make us sound like smooth  broadcasters?  You do, right?  That would be cut out from 6 to 11.  Oh, that's hurtful now.  Professional broadcasters, 9. 
[03:54:00]  Bill K. saying, we demand Spuds Buckley.  I can't find that fucking cassette.  There is one.  And I will find it.  I'm not trying to make excuses.  But that'll be the day that I call in sick.  I will throw the cassette at Anthony.  I want to hear the voice.  And I will run away.  Gotta hear the voice.  Just think, uh, Jerry Lewis on Healy.  That's what I mean.  Can you do Spuds real quick?  Nah.  Well, you can remember.  Nah, I really can't.  He does these impressions.  It sounds just like Spuds Buckley.  He does these impersonations.  You wish you'd never heard it.  I gotta, I gotta, I gotta, I gotta poll up. 
[03:54:30]  You wish you'd never heard it.  I gotta poll up.  I can't do it anymore.  I got a little poll up on my, my vocal cord.  Oh, come on.  I can barely say,  Shirehorst.  Shirehorst.  Hey, why don't you put these, Spud,  did you put these pictures up?  Nah, yeah, we're waiting for you, you're okay.  I don't give a shit.  I told you you could put these up.  Yeah, stop joking off to me, Rook.  I was a handsome devil.  I'll say you were.  Ooh.  Wow.  Spuds Puzzley.  Sweatpants with really white sneakers  with socks pulled up almost to the fucking knees. 
[03:55:00]  Nice look.  Yeah.  How do you check where your fucking things come in?  What, you fucking, right away you're getting fresh.  What, I'm breaking your balls.  Right away you fucking Spuds is getting fresh.  Let me tell you this.  See this, see this picture that's going up  on the websites today?  Hey, yeah, yeah.  Oh, the Buffalo Bettys were enjoying this look.  Oh, were they?  Yeah.  Grow the hair long, man,  and then wear a bandana.  Looks like you should be saying,  pray for me.  What are you trying to say?  I'm saying that you were a douche 
[03:55:30]  in that time of your life, Jimmy.  Oh, I was scared, Anthony.  You see this fat broad in the background?  She really, really wanted me to.  Yeah.  I was scared, guys.  I didn't want her.  I was having a discussion the other day  about fat broads and how there's this whole thing  about how they give great blowjobs.  Ugh.  Yeah.  And who cares?  Exactly.  If you're looking down at a fat broad,  it ain't helping.  No, no.  You're lost. 
[03:56:00]  What?  You're lost.  No, he's right.  No, he's not.  I am right.  Really hot girls don't try hard.  There has to be.  Because they're used to having sex.  I'd rather have a hot girl do a mediocre job  than a fat girl do a dynamite job.  You know why?  Because I want to be able to look down  and have visual stimulation  along with the blowjob.  What about the...  I'm not going to sit there  and look at some fucking mess.  What about the wanting  in the fat girl's eyes?  Yeah, the wanting of a ham sandwich. 
[03:56:30]  The wanting of,  oh my God,  I don't get to do this often,  so this is going to be damn...  No.  I was thinking...  Fat hands grabbing your dick.  Oh, big, like,  indented knuckles  because of the fat...  Yeah, she has...  It looks like...  It looks like the fucking wrist  has been, like,  just sewn on  because there's a layer of fat...  There's a line.  It looks like it's sewn on.  Yeah, get your fat hand off my dick,  fucking Twinkie lover.  Stop it.  I was thinking the same thing  the other day.  I swear to God.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:57:00]  It just comes up in conversation.  But I got a new thing.  Why?  I was just kind of, like,  just dazing off  and thinking about that.  The fat chick  because it always starts  with the fat chick.  Yeah, yeah.  I am convinced  that amputees  are just beyond amazing in bed.  Like, just ridiculous.  How?  Because they're missing a body part  so they're a little insecure and stuff  and they're like,  holy shit,  I don't know when I'm going to fuck again.  Well, that's what you want,  some freak blowing you  and jerking off  and feeling your balls with their feet.  But see, you gotta cut...  Wouldn't that be great?  You gotta take the... 
[03:57:30]  Fold it up like a yoga expert.  Take the prettiness out.  Think animalistic.  Now, a girl that's missing a body part,  animalistic,  it's going to be insane  because she knows  she's got to, like,  give it her all  because she doesn't know  when she's going to fuck again.  Exactly.  No, I disagree.  I know what you're saying.  It doesn't have to be  a whole arm or anything.  Like, let's say a pinky  is missing.  No.  Why not?  It's just ugly.  Beat it with your missing pinky.  How about a piece of an ear?  That's fine.  I'll just turn on  her fucking profile.  Fucking deep dicker 
[03:58:00]  from the side.  I don't want no  missing body parts  at all.  That's the clit.  I think that's hilarious.  Danny, missing body parts?  Thumbs up.  Thumbs up  or thumbs down?  I just walked into this.  No.  This is a serious,  serious...  Issue.  Issue.  Facing us today.  You need visual stimulus.  That's right.  If you're getting a blowjob  that's, like,  really good  from a girl  that is visually repulsive, 
[03:58:30]  it's not as good  as a hot girl  giving you a half-assed blowjob.  Isn't there a turn-on factor  when you know the chick  is really, really into you  and she's really, really into you  or what's going on  because she's a mess?  Not a mess.  And that wouldn't be  a turn-on to you.  You would still need  the hot chick  that is so used to having sex  that she could care less  at this point.  No.  It doesn't help me  visually.  The mental thing's, you know,  already there or something.  But you're talking about, like, 
[03:59:00]  because she wants  to put more into it.  Yeah.  Yeah, that doesn't matter.  What am I looking at?  Exactly.  I'm looking at a lump of shit.  Yep.  Ace for effort.  Beat it, fatty.  I'm not saying, like...  I want to look at something.  You know how much stimulation  there is  in just looking  like that?  You can't just look down  and see fucking Jabba the Hutt  like one of those frogs  he pops in his mouth  and puts you a fucking...  You want to watch  some amputee porn?  I found some...  Did you?  Yeah, look at this amputee porn. 
[03:59:30]  Man, if you remove the foot,  man, that becomes a sex toy.  Holy shit.  Oh, is it stump fucking?  Yeah, wow.  There's just no reason for that.  All you have to do  is get rid of the foot  and you guys...  You got yourself a...  Ew, and you can see  the soft, tissue-y area.  It's like a stretch  Armstrong hand.  When the fuck  was this made?  They pair in pet rocks  and mood rings?  Oh, wow.  That's kind of funny.  Come on, it's old.  The chick is sitting on a cock  and she's fucking  another girl  with her stump.  It's great.  What do you wash first  when you're finished? 
[04:00:00]  Oh, God.  You think McCartney  had threesomes like that?  Yeah.  I was waiting for McCartney  to pull up  and take her home.  Time to go, love.  That's right.  She'd sit on fucking...  on George Harrison's brain  and fuck him  with her stump.  Look what happens  when you take away  the annoying foot, though, man.  Wow.  You got a nice sex toy.  She's a great ass, though.  She's probably enjoying it.  She's cocked on hard.  My fat chick is listening  from PA writes,  my chick is fat  and is great in bed. 
[04:00:30]  Disgusting, but great.  Disgusting.  He says it right there.  Disgusting.  She's great in bed.  You know what's disgusting?  That is really fucking rude.  She's being stumpfucked.  Overweight?  Amputee or ex-wife?  Linger longer.  Overweight, amputee...  Or ex-wife.  Or ex-wife?  Yes.  Who would you fuck?  Wow.  I fucking go homo.  All right.  Here's the thing.  Go homo.  You have to make love to you.  But that's not a choice. 
[04:01:00]  What the hell is she sucking on?  What was that?  That was a penis?  I don't know if that was a stump  or what.  Amputee fatty.  Is that Paula?  I'd have to go amputee fatty.  How about this?  That's who the crazy fuck was?  He aged 50 years.  Would you kiss another man in the mouth?  Who's what?  That's Paula!  From Ron and Fez.  Sorry, Jimmy.  Oh, yeah.  He looks like shit.  Would you kiss another man in the mouth  and hold the small of his back  or make love to your wife?  Ex-wife.  And tell her you love her  and have her say, 
[04:01:30]  just come inside me, baby.  Oh, God, no.  Fill me.  No.  I can't.  No, I'm not going to be a homo  and I'm not fucking her.  You have to do one.  No, I don't.  Why?  Because you said it.  I have to.  Wait, can you move this  so I can see the whole porn thing?  Oh, my God.  Ew.  Oh, look at that.  She has nothing below the waist.  Oh, my God.  It's like he's grabbing  two fucking Kaiser rolls  that is stuck to the cyber hips.  Her legs,  they look like little Kaiser rolls.  And she's just laying there  feeling like the silly goose 
[04:02:00]  that she should feel like.  Amputee porn rolls.  What has she got?  Is that her aunt?  What is that?  What is he fucking?  An injury.  He's fucking her injury.  She's got nothing  from like the belly button down,  it looks like.  He's fucking her liver  or something.  It's horrendous.  And what's that lump of shit  hanging off the side?  Her head.  That's him.  That used to be her hip.  Let's say hi to Marcos  from Jersey.  Marcos, what's up?  Marcos.  Hey, what's going on, folks?  Hey.  Good evening.  Hey, Opie.  I got to agree with you, man. 
[04:02:30]  Best blowjob  was a fat black chick  when I was 18, man.  I haven't had nothing  better since.  All right, why was it  a good blowjob, though?  What's that?  Why was it a good blowjob?  Yeah.  I don't know.  She was going down at me  and like two minutes later  she looked up  and she was like,  I'm going to make you nuts.  And I looked at her  like she was crazy  and two minutes later  my toes were rolled up.  I got a good blowjob  from a girl who's heavier  but not a big fatty.  What is this?  Oh, she's missing one arm?  Yeah, but she still has nice tits.  Yeah, it's great. 
[04:03:00]  Just stand outside  and poke your tits  through the window.  Just tie the curtains  around them  and not look at you.  What the fuck?  Amputee porn rules.  I got to keep saying it.  Let's go to Rob  on Long Island.  Rob.  Hey there, Rob.  How are you guys?  Good.  Opie, don't you already  have this experience  like in lockdown  with an amputee  in a bathtub?  Well, I could have  but I openly laughed at her  and I messed my chance up.  Plus the fact that  I was being a good  fucking boyfriend 
[04:03:30]  at the time.  Probably should have done  the one-legged,  one-legged,  the one-armed bitch.  That's right.  Just saying you had  the opportunity.  I had the opportunity  and I openly laughed at her  and I blew it.  I still laugh  just thinking of that, man.  Yeah, see?  You could have fucking  gotten like a stump  fucking up your ass  if you wanted.  That's right.  We should do a bit.  The biggest laugh you had  that involves a girl  when it wasn't supposed  to be a laughing situation. 
[04:04:00]  Mine is easily  just fucking drinking  a few beers.  Next thing I know  someone's calling me  into the bathroom  and this girl's naked  in a bathtub  with bubbles and candles  and she's got one arm  and I didn't know  she had an arm until  I didn't know  she was missing her arm  until then.  You guys got one?  Jimmy?  I'm trying to think.  Were you laughing  when you weren't supposed to?  Same thing happened to me  but it was with both legs.  Nothing?  I was laughing.  I was thinking  if it might be real.  No, no.  I don't know actually. 
[04:04:30]  Hey, here's Dennis Miller, man.  All right.  Hello?  Yeah.  Am I on?  Yes, you are.  Okay.  My husband  before we were dating  before we were married  went on and met a girl  in a bar  and she was really hot  and he said she had  big boobs or whatever  and he made a date with her  and she said to him  on the phone  oh, I have a boyfriend  is that going to bother you?  And he was like  no, it's not going to bother me.  He went and picked her up  and she was missing  like half her arm.  So the whole date  he had to like  deal with the fact  that she didn't have  half her arm 
[04:05:00]  and then  she called him  the next day  for another date  and he was like  you know  the boyfriend thing  really kind of bothers me  because he couldn't tell  that he didn't want a date  or what he wanted  to have an arm.  I mean, you never heard  a cheat  if she found someone  that didn't mind  picking up her watch  400 times a night.  400.  Not just once.  It's my favorite story.  But she just doesn't get  the lesson.  The watch.  She's a clean  I got it.  I know.  Just over and over  and over again.  Can't you learn anything 
[04:05:30]  you dope?  How stupid she must look  with a mitten on one hand  and the other one  just rubber banded  around her stump.  Silly mitten.  It's my all time  favorite story of his though.  The missing hand.  Yeah.  I had something on that.  Missing hand.  And he said  when she was like  laughing at a joke  she kind of hit him  with the stump  and it totally  schemes him out.  Ew, of course.  Oh, this is what I have  on that.  I see guys  unfortunately because of Iraq  walking around  with the one leg  and stuff  and they got the  fake leg figured out.  Yeah.  No one wants to have 
[04:06:00]  a fake leg  but if you're going  to lose a body part  that's a good one to lose  because they got it  kind of figured out.  They even got the  mechanism where  little springy thingy  springy thing  where it kind of moves  like a real leg  and you're not kind of  you know what I mean?  You're not lipping along.  It's amazing.  What they don't have  figured out is the fake arm.  Going back to the  one arm bitch.  Well, they can't do  the open and close  of the hand very well.  No, so this girl  I think she had an arm  that was supposed  to make her look good  in public  but remember how  it was like a mannequin's arm?  Yeah. 
[04:06:30]  It just looked creepy  and then there was like  a bracelet around  the mannequin arm?  Yeah, she had a bracelet  on it.  Fake sling.  Don't draw attention to it.  Right.  Yeah.  Huh?  Just drawing attention  to it with jewelry.  It's got like  jewelry on it.  Yeah.  It would slide though  like that made a plastic sound  whenever she walked.  Let's say hi to Alex.  How about an age ribbon?  Tape that to us.  Alex.  What's up?  What's up?  Hello.  Opie, I remember  yesterday you were talking  about your buddy Eddie  from Big Brother.  The guy with the one leg.  Whatever happened to him? 
[04:07:00]  I got to call him, man.  It's been a while.  You don't like him, do you?  I really like Eddie.  You liked him?  I don't remember him.  He's a really cool guy.  He's a good guy.  He's really, really cool.  He's an animal too  with one leg, man.  Did you find what he did  with the money?  Yeah, with a trap  on the other one.  Dude, he's...  I watched him play  wheelchair basketball  and I thought it was  going to be a cute little  like, let's slowly  go down the court  and get a little exercise,  whatever.  The animals, man.  Head over heels,  diving out of bounds 
[04:07:30]  with wheelchairs  attached to them.  Just animals.  Yeah.  He's unfortunate though  because he lost his leg  so high up  that they can't give him  a fake leg,  which is his bummer in life.  Where is it?  It's way high.  How is it?  See, if you give him  a little area to work with,  they could get you  a fake leg,  but he doesn't have much.  Screw it in.  How old did he lose it?  Huh?  How?  He had cancer as a kid  and as a precaution  so it wouldn't spread.  They took the leg.  Imagine that. 
[04:08:00]  Imagine that.  But he does have a leg  that he uses for weddings  and stuff  when he wants to just  look good and stuff,  but for the most part...  A leg for weddings?  Yeah.  Well, he can't move around  that well  because it's so high up,  but it gets sort of  the job done.  But, you know,  you can't get one  of these athletic legs  that you see...  Yeah.  You know, like in Superbad  where that kid's running  with two fake legs.  Fat bitch B-roll.  See?  There you go.  See?  You want that?  You want to look at that?  Not...  No!  I feel it.  It's all sweaty.  It's getting everything in your head.  You gotta look at it. 
[04:08:30]  Who says you have to  take it out to dinner?  I'm not saying out to dinner.  It's gonna be laying there  fucking...  You gotta look?  Ugh.  Oh, I don't know.  Oh, boy.  Footer has two hooks for arms.  Footer.  Yo, what's up?  You have two hooks for arms?  No, no, no, no.  I saw...  Well, I thought that was hilarious  because your name's Footer.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  Okay.  All right.  I can breathe again.  A friend of mine was...  Growing up, I was hanging with him all the time. 
[04:09:00]  He got into a really bad accident.  He lost both of his arms.  Jesus.  Didn't see him in, like, ten years.  Walking to a diner, he's there.  He's like, hey, Footer, what's up, man?  Throwing up the hook like a meal out.  I walk over.  He puts the hook out for me to shake it.  You know, it's a little uncomfortable,  so I just kind of grab it  and give it a little shake up and down.  He's like, come on!  Give it a good shake!  Come on!  Like, making me all uncomfortable.  So I grab it.  I give it a good tug like I would.  But next thing you know,  the kid had to adjust the top of the arm  because I kind of, like,  adjusted the hook the wrong way.  He had to readjust. 
[04:09:30]  Wow.  I'm punching out.  No, well, E-Rock distracted me.  You might have had a good story.  I'll find out during the replay.  E-Rock, special guest tomorrow on the show?  Tomorrow, 8 a.m.,  we will have Dave Rabbit on the phone.  Fuck.  How does he sound?  I haven't talked to him yet.  He just sent me an email,  said, yeah, he'll do the show tomorrow.  Does he know that he's getting  a lot of attention today?  Mm-hmm.  We explained how much time  we dedicated to his material today. 
[04:10:00]  And the guy's not very emotional  about anything.  So he's just like,  I'll call tomorrow.  Send me the information.  Same delivery?  Through the emails.  I have to call him later.  How did you know he wasn't crying  when he read it?  What are you,  a fucking email psychologist?  No.  He's keeping...  Did you look at the return path?  All right, one more story,  then we got to get out of here.  Jeff, the trucker.  Jeff.  Oh, I got a doctor.  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, I...  When I first started getting hookers,  the first one I ever got 
[04:10:30]  was a fat blonde chick.  And I was real nervous  about her and everything else,  you know,  but she did a really good job.  Yeah, I didn't even...  Yeah, I wasn't even worried about it.  I've had...  I've had good-looking ones  and everything else in between.  There were things like,  the other night I got this one  at the truck stop.  She looked great  and everything else,  but she was just...  Didn't do a very good job,  you know?  Jimmy, you know when they  want to go too fast  and they rush you?  I couldn't even finish.  I was just like,  yeah, you know what?  Forget it.  And they start saying stuff like, 
[04:11:00]  come on, Daddy,  come for me.  Yes, exactly.  You know?  Usually, they say,  Daddy, that's it,  but this just didn't do it,  you know?  It's just...  You know, she's just like,  oh, come on.  Here's her teeth.  She sucked.  And then, of course...  Then, of course,  you've got to kill her  and bury the body somewhere,  right?  Absolutely.  Well, you know...  Right?  I just kick him out,  you know how to do it.  All right, Jeff.  I don't want to go with the trailer.  Thank you, sir.  Goodbye.  All right, well,  I'm glad my amputee  thought...  did nothing.  Guys, I've got to go to doctors. 
[04:11:30]  I've got problems.  Yeah, what...  What happened there, Jimmy?  Nice to night checkup,  my monthly checkup.  Ah.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  What's this...  What's amputated on this one?  Oh, what are you talking about?  It's certainly not his cock.  Wow.  Holy shit, fella.  Wow.  What the fuck, dude?  Well, he has a little potbelly  and a big gut.  A big dick.  Fuck me.  Tired.  Tired.  I was falling asleep  during the Mythbusters.  Was it our questioning?  No, it was their dumb answers. 
[04:12:00]  We're a family, really.  Oh, yeah.  You blow things up  and shoot things.  Shut up.  What's wrong with you?  Show me some fucking...  A sexual thing.  That was a good question.  Thank you, Jimmy.  We couldn't say the word sex.  Yeah, I'm with you.  Why?  I didn't say cunt eating.  Yeah, he did get defensive a little bit.  Yeah, exactly.  Fucking cornball.  I was ready to blast him  with some of my...  My attitude.  I know.  I talk a lot of shit  an hour later, don't I?  Oh, yeah.  Meanwhile, I just sat there  like sleepy boy  and listened.  Okay, good point.  They're long gone.  They've done ten interviews  since this one  and now you're saying something. 
[04:12:30]  They're all right.  Fucking creeps.  Oh, just hit that button.  We're tired.  That's how we end.  It's the man of Wednesday!  Wednesday.  Oh, my God.

Guess how many boob dates are there?  Can?  I don't have those.  You are spectacular.  Wow!  Boob.  I don't have those.  I don't have those.  I don't have those.  I don't have those.
