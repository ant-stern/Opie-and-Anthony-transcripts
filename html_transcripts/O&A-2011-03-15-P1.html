<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with a discussion of the Japanese earthquake and tsunami, focusing on the nuclear reactor crisis and the immediate dissemination of information via social media.  They debated the pros and cons of constant access to global events, with a caller, Mike, an electrical engineer specializing in nuclear power plants, providing technical details about reactor cooling and decay heat. This led to a discussion of personal preparedness and "go bags."

The conversation then shifted to the firing of Gilbert Gottfried from Aflac for his jokes about the disaster, prompting a debate on the appropriateness of humor in the face of tragedy and a satirical critique of Aflac's response.  This section included a humorous mock audition for the Aflac duck voice. The show then veered into a search for overweight or unattractive news anchors, punctuated by crude humor and offensive jokes.

A subsequent segment started with disparaging remarks about Sarah Jessica Parker and Ellen DeGeneres and their makeup commercials, followed by a scathing critique of Ellen's audience. Highly offensive language was used to describe news anchor Kim Setti, before a brief moment of sympathy upon learning of her cancer diagnosis.  The hosts then praised Eddie Trunk's new book and shared memories of pop-up books.  They mocked a video of a young girl attributing the earthquake to God's will, a video later revealed to be satirical, sparking discussion of internet trolls and Poe's Law.  A bullying video was also discussed. Comedian Davey Redd called in, performing a stand-up routine, and the hosts compared it to a Billy the Bassman bit performed previously by Eastside Dave.  The segment concluded with discussions of broken iPhones, a planned comedy book ("Boats Down There"),  explicitly offensive "Dirty Elvis" audio, cryptic text messages, and one host's finger deformity.

The next portion opened with highly vulgar and sexually degrading comments about Priscilla Presley and Jennifer Aniston, followed by a caller's anecdote about an Elvis impersonator and discussion of an Elvis-themed radio channel.  The Japanese nuclear disaster was revisited, with the hosts and callers making light of the situation and discussing the disaster scale.  Significant time was dedicated to humorous anxieties about a staff member, Jimmy, flying on an old DC-9 plane, alongside the display of numerous DC-9 crash photos.  A listener from Japan provided some information about the situation there.  The segment also included ghost stories, a funeral home worker's disturbing anecdote, and graphic descriptions of the embalming process.


The final excerpt began with a darkly humorous conversation about funeral home practices, including detailed descriptions of embalming techniques and the disposal of bodily fluids, featuring an unidentified guest, possibly a funeral director.  The conversation then transitioned to professional wrestling, focusing on Snooki and Angelina Love, with detailed and graphic descriptions of Snooki's physique, again employing vulgar and derogatory language. A listener from Japan reported another earthquake, prompting brief discussion of seismic activity and the impact on the financial markets. The segment concluded with audio of a conflict between the hosts, the funeral director's employer Jay Thomas, and comedian Ira, including Ira reading celebrity tweets.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cring style of entertainment and having very few limits.  Oh, my God. 
[00:00:30]  Okay, no, this is getting really intense, though.  It starts funny, and it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  You get the crazier, the better.  What, are you, 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show is on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go, fuck.  I have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime. 
[00:01:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Remember him?  The show.  Remember Charlie Sheen?  Sit back and enjoy the show.  Yeah, we all remember him.  He was the disaster before the disaster.  Right.  See, he had his meltdown and then, well, oh boy, oh boy.  Oh boy.  Yeah. 
[00:01:30]  You know what's weird about this Japanese disaster?  What?  You turn off the news and you open up a window, you hear nothing but birds and crickets.  Beautiful.  And it calms you the fuck down.  It's nice.  Because if you watch the news a little too long, you're convinced the world is ending.  You don't want to go outside.  Hell no.  And then you step outside.  You put your hands on your hips, right?  Yeah.  And you stand there.  You look up at the trees and you go, ah.  Ah, you breathe deep air that isn't full of radiation and you go, where is all this happening? 
[00:02:00]  You know what we were discussing at our house over the weekend is the fact that, you know,  shit has been happening around the world for forever, obviously, right?  But now that we have the Twitter and the Facebook, by the way, I'm going to put the thought in  front of everything today because it's driving someone out there nuts.  And that just makes me want to do it more, by the way.  You got the social networking.  You got all the media outlets.  So now you get instant news constantly.  There was a time in, not that far, not that far long ago, whatever, sorry, a couple hundred 
[00:02:30]  years or whatever, that if there was a huge earthquake affecting a lot of people, you never  heard about it.  You would go your whole life with not hearing about what was happening on the other side  of the earth.  You'd never know it.  And in some ways, I think that's better.  Yeah.  Because somehow we're all getting connected to Japan.  And everybody becomes panicky Pete.  And we got our own shit we got to deal with.  Yes.  I was doing taxes last night. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  You got that FedEx.  Yeah, I did.  A big box and you got to sign a bunch of things.  So what's better?  Tax season.  The question is, what's better?  Knowing instantly all the crazy shit that's going on in the world or maybe shutting down  some of this knowledge and some of this info and just living your life, not even knowing  what's going on elsewhere.  Interesting.  Ignorance being bliss.  What's better in the end?  Because it's just people to fuck with you when nobody can know about it.  I think it's harder for people to fuck with people now than it was at one point. 
[00:03:30]  But it stresses the shit out of a lot of people.  A lot of people are stressed out because of what's happening in Japan, even though we have  no connection there.  I mean, certainly some of the people listening to us have a real connection to Japan.  But a lot of us that are being really affected by this, we don't have any connection.  We get all stressed out when we see the latest tsunami video of destroying a town or something.  It's crazy to watch that shit.  Oh, here's the latest one right here.  Wow.  Oh, I know.  I've seen. 
[00:04:00]  This one is sick.  They show a giant tidal wave rushing in.  Yeah.  And have you seen the one from the ocean?  It was like from a helicopter?  No.  They showed a big wave and you're like, all right, that looks pretty big.  But you don't realize the scope of it until it goes to shore and you see this little  tiny marina.  Oh, brother.  And it just wipes it out.  It finally gave its scale.  Yeah.  And you're like, holy fuck, that's giant.  That is really scary.  Well, yeah, the latest on Japan, wow, just thousands missing, dead. 
[00:04:30]  And the reactors are kind of the big story right now because that situation is out of  control.  And I started thinking this last night.  Well, there are four reactors in one area.  Thank God.  In one reactor complex.  At least they're in the one area.  Yeah.  And they're all fucked.  They're saying now that there have definitely been at least partial meltdowns.  Some of these fuel rods have been exposed for more than two and a half to three hours. 
[00:05:00]  Now the cooling tanks that these things are sitting in are boiling.  The water is boiling in it and just evaporating away in radioactive steam.  And there's no way, there's no off switch for these things, which led me to think, if there  is some type of, not a full on Armageddon type thing, but one where a power goes out, people  are panicking, shit's going down, these world reactors are going to kill us all because 
[00:05:30]  there'll be no way to cool them.  And you can't just shut them off.  There's no way to just turn a reactor off.  Once you get it started and running, that fucker has to be kept cool until they remove  the spent fuel rods, separate them, store them in an underground location that's deemed  safe.  That's what they do with the rods from reactors that we use now in the middle of the Mojave  Desert somewhere.  Right.  Uh, but you can't, unless you have people that do that and can do that, uh, and, and 
[00:06:00]  the tools work and the power is on, that shit just ain't going to happen.  So if we even have a partial anarchy type Armageddon apocalyptic thing go on, the reactors  are going to be what fucks.  I heard some creepy scientists on, on the TV.  Ah, you did.  Not that.  They got a lot of them now.  Oh yeah, they're coming out of the woodwork.  And they said that, uh, if, if people walk away from a nuclear power plant, it would shut 
[00:06:30]  itself down.  Did you, did you hear that guy?  It could shut itself down, but the thing is...  What's the difference between that and what you're saying, I guess is what I'm getting  at.  They can shut down, but they can't self-sustain the cooling that's needed, uh, without electricity,  without the pumps, batteries will give out for any length of time.  Yeah.  The, even these reactors, they shut down the reactors in Japan. 
[00:07:00]  The second that earthquake hit, the reactors shut down.  Okay.  All right.  But you can't stop the, the, uh, nuclear reaction that's happening inside unless you  separate the, the core rods.  Once they get together, they act like a little team.  They're all like, yeah, ho ho.  Right.  But, but, uh, it's the same thing like an atomic bomb, how that works.  Right, right.  You got two masses of radioactive material.  They're fine by themselves.  The second you smash them together, you get what's called critical mass and you get an  atomic explosion.  With a nuclear reactor, when the rods are all together, you get that critical mass, uh, 
[00:07:30]  that causes a lot of heat until they're all separated.  And they're still radioactive at that point, by the way, but they're just not critical  mass and won't start melting down, uh, and, and stored away.  That's the only way they're not, uh, uh, critical mass.  They have to be separated.  So who's going to separate them if people walked away from reactors and it shuts down?  Uh, the water's going to go away eventually.  The pumps are going to stop working.  And these fucking things are going to be uncovered and then they're going to fucking 
[00:08:00]  melt.  Well, luckily, luckily we don't have a lot of them around.  No, no, there's not a one.  Did you see?  Oh, that's right.  The oldest one in the country is 75 miles from New York city.  Right.  Did you?  Yeah.  I heard.  And made by the same people that made the Japanese.  Is that the point one they're talking about?  That's our, that's our local angle.  That's the local angle.  I saw the map of all the, uh, power plants in the United States.  I'm like, Oh, this isn't good.  There were, there were a lot of dots on the East coast, man.  A lot of dots.  A lot of dots.  Oh, a lot of dots. 
[00:08:30]  And do you know, like, this is what a self-centered fool I am.  As you're talking about the meltdown and then showing Japan tsunami footage, a part of  my mind is still distracted because I lost another pair of sunglasses.  It is amazing how things are intangible and they're not right in front of you.  Of course.  Of course.  They're intangible.  You got your, uh, you got your go bags?  Everyone got a go bag?  I don't have a go bag.  What's a go bag?  What's a go bag?  I already told you, man.  You're not even going to survive.  I keep my, I keep my, I keep this bag, which has just minimal stuff in it. 
[00:09:00]  Right.  But at home, I got a go bag.  Yeah.  And that's up in my, uh, my, uh, gun safe.  But where are you going?  You live on Long Island.  Exactly.  You don't know.  What is it, a raft?  You could walk out with your go bag all prepared and just drop dead.  I understand that.  Where are you going?  But if something, you just, you got to go to where no one is.  Where's that?  You got to go into.  You do realize where you live, right?  If you want to, if you want to get out, you just got to, you got to get away from the danger.  How?  By getting away. 
[00:09:30]  Are you going to get a boat?  And using your resources.  A boat?  Could be a boat.  Boat might be the best thing.  But you got to be, you got to think on your feet.  When things happen, you got to know what's happening and where to go.  So you get your go bag.  I'm on the high ground.  I'm good.  Oh, and I'm on the top floor of a skyscraper.  I'll just fight the zombies.  In Manhattan.  I'll fight the zombies and the Puerto Ricans as they're coming up those stairs.  Yes.  I'll be good for a while.  Who wants to climb as high as I am?  I'm good.  You think they'll just be like, and yes, there are some arms and ammunition in the go bag. 
[00:10:00]  There has to be.  Of course.  All right.  There's, you know, those little things that you need to start fires with, some shelter,  things like, you know, food and water packs and filters for water for a few days.  And you just keep that in your house.  And it's in like a backpack thing.  And you keep that.  And like I said, you could be laying dead on top of the thing.  Minute one into what happens.  At least you had a go bag.  But yeah, you know, that's then for the next guy that comes in to go, hey, cool, a go bag. 
[00:10:30]  Like, you know, I have little water packs in my truck, like a little, because I think  I got them as a gift.  Like one of the Tonight Show gift bags they give you, had a little survival kit.  There you go.  Where are we going to go?  Who wants to live if there's a nuclear problem?  I don't care.  Me!  I want to.  It's going to be the greatest show on earth.  Better than any movie.  I enjoy mountains and farms.  Yeah, there you go.  I'd find one of those.  How about the fucking.  I would take out the family that's living there and take over their spot.  How about you go to Area 51? 
[00:11:00]  Area 51.  Go to the dead.  It all depends on where the shit's happening, what it is that's happening, and what the opportunities  and resources you have to go somewhere.  All right, listen.  Do you have a car?  Or are you going to have to grab something else or walk or do whatever?  You know, there's a lot of situations where you got to think on your feet.  You're bumming everyone out.  Am I?  With what you just said.  Come on.  We're going to get an expert from Pittsburgh, Mike.  All right.  Who builds nuclear power plants.  Oh, that's good.  Mikey. 
[00:11:30]  Hey, morning, boys.  How are you doing?  Good morning.  Hi, sir.  That was a great movie.  Hey.  Yeah.  Hey, I was just going to give a few more details on what you're talking about.  All right, sir.  Once you shut those things down, it's not entirely true that the reaction continues.  You get a lot of heat that's still put off by them.  It works out to be about maybe 6% of the total capacity.  So, like, for a thousand megawatt generator, you get maybe.  It's 6%, so it's like 60 megawatts of heat that continues for a while.  It's called decay heat.  Yeah.  But with the older plants, that heat has to be circulated with the pumps to remove the heat from the core. 
[00:12:00]  Otherwise, you have problems.  But with some of the newer designs, they're designed with natural circulation so that you don't need any pumps.  So you could shut it down.  Now, natural circulation, where does that come from?  I don't know.  I'm an electrical engineer.  I was waiting to ask what you did at these nuclear power plants.  I'm wondering where natural circulation comes from. 
[00:12:30]  I guess a lot of these things are built by water supplies, rivers and whatnot.  So I guess that pressure would be used to continuously put water through it.  But as we saw, systems fail in Japan.  I think what happened there was they lost their backup power.  They have on-site diesel generators.  And when the tsunami came in, it took out that.  Right.  Even though they shut down in advance of the earthquake and the tsunami coming in, they couldn't provide that power to circulate for the pumps to circulate to pulling water.  Yes.  And they were trying with the ocean water, with salt water, to just flood that containment area. 
[00:13:00]  And that wasn't working.  And they said, like, for two and a half hours, the rods were fully exposed.  Wow.  That's fucked.  Not good.  There's no bringing that back.  Like, you can't then just use normal procedures to get power back and have these reactors run and go into safety mode.  What, a shunt?  So what happens now? 
[00:13:30]  Once they figure out how to cool them down, I mean, the plant, I think, is basically fucked.  It's done.  Of course.  Of course.  Yeah.  How hot is it?  How hot do those things get?  Uh, I'm not sure.  It's an electrical engineer.  I'm not quite sure.  It gets hot enough to melt and crumble things like cement, concrete, steel reinforcement, things like that. 
[00:14:00]  It does get hot enough to just go right through that shit, which is fucking amazing.  Uh, I don't know.  They're going to have to, what they're going to have to do is, uh, what they did in Chernobyl, just to encase this shit in, in tons and tons of cement.  Is that what they did?  After a while.  Yeah.  But it was melting down and they just put cement around it?  They just, it took a while for them to even get to the point where they could do that.  But, uh, after a while they, they went in and just encased the entire thing in cement.  And that's where it sits right now.  And underneath, tons and tons of concrete. 
[00:14:30]  And what's going on in the middle of that cement?  Yeah, a fucking huge amount of heat.  Still.  Still.  For how long?  Still in Chernobyl.  Oh, fuck.  How long?  How long do we, how long are we going to be here?  Way past our lives?  There's quite a half-life, uh, to that shit.  God, what the fuck are we doing as humans in the end?  It's so stupid.  Maybe 10,000 years and shit.  We're making things that you can't just shut off is what's fucked up.  We're too trusting.  We're assuming we'll be here to take care of this shit and that the energy will be here to take care of it. 
[00:15:00]  And the system will be here to take care of it.  When, in essence, things happen and you cannot get to, to the off switch.  And then you got to find volunteers willing to go in there.  Willing to go in and try to cool the shit down.  Pretty much risk their lives.  Yeah.  Fucked up.  High levels of radiation around the nuclear power plants.  It's spiking.  And they're, they're saying, uh, it's now dangerous for you to even be in that area.  And, uh, they've noticed, uh, levels not very high, but rising in Tokyo. 
[00:15:30]  Jesus.  So that's, uh, that's a biggie.  The Nikkei, uh, the market over there in Japan, huge sell-off.  And, uh, here, the market, uh, we're looking at a 300-point, um, negative on the Dow futures.  It's going to be an ugly day.  So the market's going to take a giant shite.  It's only the world's, what, third largest economy?  Yeah, yeah.  Now has radiation in the air?  Yeah.  And it's as bad as, as it gets over there.  But they, they're just slowly letting the news out. 
[00:16:00]  Get your go bag.  They're slowly letting the news out.  You know?  Yeah.  They're trying to control the information, but, uh, obviously this was bad from, you  know, three, four days ago.  Yep.  But now they're finally, all right, all right, it's bad.  Fuck.  I don't think they wanted to really let it out and be like, eh, eh, eh, eh.  Yeah, because there was enough panic.  Yeah.  Now, uh, and, and when you think about it, without any of this radiation, without any of the nuclear  power plant, this is a giant disaster.  Yeah.  Like, it's still, there's thousands of people missing and, and dead and, uh. 
[00:16:30]  They're starting bonfires on the streets.  Yeah.  Because it's still winter over there and there's so many people homeless and they're  just starting bonfires just to stay warm.  And then in that, now this, uh, these reactors are the big story.  It kind of, the other thing took second fiddle there, a backseat to the, the reactors, but  they're still like fucking, there's people dead from a huge earthquake.  And now they're saying it was a 9.0, right?  Yeah.  They moved it up to a 9.0 officially.  That's a giant fucking earthquake. 
[00:17:00]  And if it wasn't Japan, who was at least technologically, I think of them rebuilding in the 40s and knowing  it probably helped a little bit because, uh, they didn't lose as many structures as it probably would have.  Oh yeah, of course.  They said there would have been hundreds of thousands of people that died if they didn't  have, uh, codes, building codes.  Yep.  Yeah, they built that shit properly.  But you can't, you can't build, uh, to prevent a tsunami wave from knocking down.  What was worse, the flood or the earthquake?  I think the flood was worse.  The flood was, no, they said the flood was way worse.  The tsunami was way worse than the actual earthquake.  The flood fucked it up.  Fucked up a lot of the power, um, that they needed, the backup power. 
[00:17:30]  Uh, I was watching some video clips, uh, some, some website had them on.  I can't remember the name of it, but it was, uh, comparing, um, Haiti's earthquake and the  reaction after Haiti and a few days later with, uh, Japan and the reaction a few days later.  And wow, just a big difference.  I don't know what it is.  I think they were showing that on the news also, that there's a very, a very, uh, cultural  difference with the Japanese people and how they react to emergencies and, uh, pull together 
[00:18:00]  and stuff.  Because, uh, one video, I won't say which one is which, but one video had people standing  on line, uh, calmly waiting for supplies and news.  And the other video had, uh, half naked people running around with machetes, looting everything  in their sight.  By the way, did they show videos of the before where the same people who stood on line were  polite and the people who had the machetes were also misbehaving?  It's not like they just changed after the earthquake. 
[00:18:30]  I know.  A culture that is, is, is a little bad before a problem before it's not going to handle it.  It was, it was, it was pretty bad to tell you the truth.  And the structural damage, uh, in Haiti was just amazing.  Asians are weird.  They're very, they're a bunch of weirdos.  Let's be honest with each other.  They know how to hand, they just, they know how to handle like major shit.  They put the greater good first.  They do.  They're more of the, they're like the Borg in a Star Trek, a collective.  They're more of a collective.  The, the Japan itself is more important than the individual. 
[00:19:00]  The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one.  And we do need Spock to go in there and open up that little thing and stick his face in  there and, and then give the long, live long and prosper.  And then, you know, no, that's not how he says it.  How does he say it?  Live long and prosper.  We need Spock's dentures.  You're a fucking asshole.  You wrecked that movie for all of us.  You really did.  He's talking over his fucking choppers.  I love that.  Vulcan choppers. 
[00:19:30]  I love that movie until he appears.  It's fantastic.  And I, all I saw was you doing his fucking impression.  But I knew there was something wrong.  Captain James T. Kirk.  Captain James T. Kirk.  I have been and always shall be your friend.  You need some space effort in.  I didn't know what it was that bothered me about him talking.  But you really did ruin it.  Yes.  You did, you jerk.  He ruined it.  Jesus.  Stupid Spock and his big dentures.  Couldn't figure out how to make his teeth nice.  Oh, I know. 
[00:20:00]  The clackety clacking in his mouth.  All right.  Continue with Japan.  And we move on to this angle.  Brandon in Austin, Texas.  What's up, Brandon?  Hey, it's Brandon from Boston.  Hello.  Wow, someone got that very wrong.  Yeah, Gilbert Gottfried being fired for his Twitter comments.  What I want to know is where, has the Affleck people, because Affleck, he does the Affleck  duck voice, and they fired him for some comments he tweeted about Japan.  Have they ever watched any of the roasts he's been on? 
[00:20:30]  It's amazing to me.  Like, he has said shit eight million times worse than what he tweeted.  He's really funny.  It's like, fuck Affleck.  Just feigning sensitivity.  It's like, don't you fucking, aren't you betting on people's lives when you insure them?  I was thinking the fucking scumbags.  I was thinking the same thing.  These are the same people that'll probably tell people they don't qualify to get any fucking  money in Japan, because they do insure people in Japan.  Again, they'll be sending out the letters going, nope, sorry, this doesn't fit the criteria.  Fuck you.  And then the president's going, the president of Affleck is saying things like, oh, this 
[00:21:00]  is terrible, and this isn't a time for any jokes, but it's time to send out letters that  say, sorry, this doesn't fall into what you were paying premiums on.  They're going to do way worse.  Pre-existing conditions.  Yeah.  Cack sack.  We knew the flood area you lived in, the Quaker area.  There was a risk of a tsunami, so sorry, you're fucked.  So you're fucked, but thank God we got Gilbert Gottfried out of there.  So annoying.  Yeah.  It really is.  I don't understand why you have to shut down comedy when shit happens. 
[00:21:30]  I don't understand that, because my thought on the whole thing, that maybe comedy kind  of helps out just a little bit.  Relieves the stress and the tension.  It does.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  I don't think it should be hateful, but I mean, why do you have to shut down comedy?  Gilbert's also just kind of a weirdo.  Yeah.  And he does that a lot.  Like, I think the first 9-11 joke I ever heard came out of Gilbert.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The first brutal one.  The first real, like, brutal, like, ooh, wow.  Yeah, he was the first, absolutely.  And then everyone followed after that. 
[00:22:00]  It's what he does.  We could do some other shit.  And I think it was on the 12th.  Dude, it was the 10th.  He's fucking hilarious.  Yeah.  He's a funny dude, man.  Yeah, yeah.  He writes really funny stuff.  And every disaster that happened, he made fun of Geraldo when he died.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's like, that's the type of comic he is in.  And all of a sudden, people have been enjoying him for 20 years.  And now you're shocked?  And now it's shocking.  You want the story here, officially?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So they've severed ties with Gilbert over his Twitter comments.  Gilbert's recent comments about the crisis in Japan were lacking in humor. 
[00:22:30]  They weren't lacking in humor.  A lot of people found him very funny, so that's stupid.  You could say it's tasteless.  You could say it's not your cup of tea.  Yeah, but certainly wasn't lacking in humor.  When we read these tweets, there's going to be a bunch of people out there laughing over them.  And certainly do not represent the thoughts and feelings of anyone at AFLAC.  Do they have to, by the way, it's all their self-interest.  Do you really, people really think, hey, the guy who does the talking duck voice is expressing the opinions of the president of AFLAC?  What are those twats?  The talking duck is the spokesperson. 
[00:23:00]  There's no place for anything but compassion and concern during these difficult times.  Yeah, compassion and concern when you're sending out the letters denying people their money.  Yeah, we should follow this story because that will come out that a bunch of people will find out they're not insured after all.  A nationwide casting call is underway.  Good luck to you, Jimmy.  AFLAC.  AFLAC.  AFLAC.  AFLAC.  That's a good one.  AFLAC.  Oh, you should do that.  Yes, I certainly should. 
[00:23:30]  AFLAC.  I'm quacking.  Would you care for some insurance?  I've got some in my beak.  AFLAC.  Ducks have bills.  Yes, they do.  Chickens have beaks.  In our pockets.  Ted, thank you for saying to me.  I'm glad you told me that, Anthony.  I'll rewrite the script I've been working on.  Gosh darn it.  All of my egg-laying jokes are now for naught.  Ted, what kind of insurance do you have?  I have all sorts of insurance.  Everything except earthquake and flood for my friends in Japan.  Wow, that seems to be what they need, though. 
[00:24:00]  Yes, it is.  But how much money do you think I have to throw around?  Well, actually, that's good because even though you don't cover that, at least you cover the radiation from the...  That will fall under flood.  I do not.  I'm selling insurance for anybody over eight feet tall whose basketball career we've ruined in Japan.  $3,000 a week for my insurance.  Bah, flack!  I'm a duck.  Excuse me.  I'm quacking.  Wow, that's some weird insurance you got for Japan.  Yes, it certainly is, Gregory.  Who the hell is going to buy that? 
[00:24:30]  Everybody.  Everybody?  Yes, they will.  Don't see them paying out too much money, to tell you the truth.  No, I don't know.  That's strange.  It's been tough going so far.  How many clients?  I have none.  None.  None of one.  I've spent $3.2 million on ads.  Bah, flack!  Holy shit.  Well, good luck to you, Ted, on getting that voice over.  Thank you very much.  Yeah, I look forward to hearing you.  Aflac.  I should audition as Ted.  You should.  I'm Aflac.  Hello?  Aflac, which does 75% of its business in Japan. 
[00:25:00]  Oh.  Well, that could be a problem.  Oh.  75% of their business.  You almost understand.  I didn't realize that.  I thought they had just a tiny little piece of the market over there.  75% of its in Japan?  Yeah, most of their business is in Japan, so it looks like they had no choice, but still.  Who in Japan was noticing Gilbert's tweets?  I'm sure nobody.  Nobody.  Also plans to donate $100 million to disaster relief.  Ray Pureface is saying, then why isn't it called Afrak? 
[00:25:30]  Oops.  Don't laugh.  Come on.  Don't laugh.  Big tragedy.  That's terrible.  Not a time for humor.  But any of us can get fired for that.  Yeah, I know.  Oh, yeah.  And I know that's eventually what's going to sink me somewhere, is just some dumb, tasteless  tweet or joke that just hits the wrong vein.  Uh, Godfrey has yet to apologize for the jokes.  He's not going to apologize, which included, I just split up with my girlfriend, but like  the Japanese say, there'll be another one floating by any minute now. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  That probably could cause a problem.  It's funny, though.  It's tasteless, but it's a fucking good joke.  Yeah, it's tasteless.  It's all, but that's what he does.  Why are you getting upset at the fucking tiger that's ripping apart a fucking gazelle?  That's what they do.  Another tweet.  Japan is really advanced.  They don't go to the beach.  The beach comes to them.  Say, all right.  That's kind of a clever twist on things. 
[00:26:30]  Uh, you know, I'm sure he's not sitting there thinking, how can I hurt people?  How could I hurt people with my words?  And another read, Japan called me.  They said, maybe those jokes are hit in the U.S., but over here, they're all sinking.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  That's how Gilbert is the talk of the country today.  Lost his gig.  Lost his Aflac gig.  The Aflac duck.  But that's good news for Ted.  I hope Ted gets it. 
[00:27:00]  I certainly hope so, too, Gregory.  Things have been dry.  Dry?  The well has run dry for my voiceover career.  I'm quacking.  Excuse me.  I don't understand why.  Practice the quack part.  Ah!  That's terrible.  That's horrible.  You gotta work on that.  Ah!  How are you fucking up the duck?  I'm not.  I'm doing a fine job, Gregory.  I've been practicing.  My throat is parched.  Ah!  Well, you gotta get ready for the audition. 
[00:27:30]  Yes, I do.  Quack!  Nationwide auditions.  There's gonna be a lot of people.  The, uh, I, you know something?  Um, I, I back Gilbert on this.  Uh, like I said, comedians, they should be able to say what they want.  Um, this isn't a, a hate thing or anything.  But, uh, I gotta say there's part of me that is like, I'm kinda glad he's not doing that  voice anymore because if you're, if you're ever watching TV late at night, um, and the 
[00:28:00]  volume is low for what you're watching, and you know every commercial's fucking louder,  when that fucking commercial comes on and he's going, ah!  Ah!  It wakes you up and, and, like, gets me, literally gets me angry.  But you sleep with the TV on.  Turn off the TV, man.  No!  Be alone with your own brain for once.  No!  The second I lay down with my own mind as the volume in my life, I can't do it.  What are the thoughts in your head that you have to push down with the TV on all night? 
[00:28:30]  It's just everything.  I don't think we, I don't think we've ever talked about this.  It's a whirlwind.  For the people that don't know, Anthony, uh, has to have the TV on when he goes to bed.  Yeah, I sleep with the TV on because, uh...  And a pretty good volume too, right?  No, no.  Just very low?  It's just barely audible.  That's why.  When it comes on, it's like, oh, gee, shut up.  Doesn't the light from the TV fuck you up when you turn asleep?  No, I kind of like the flicker.  I like that little flicker thing on the inside of the eyelids.  Yeah.  And I turn away from the TV, uh, and I could hear, and then I fall asleep.  Mm-hmm.  But, um, no, there's no one thing that, that haunts me or anything, but it's just my mind 
[00:29:00]  is constantly, constantly going.  Right.  Like, I'm thinking about everything from dumb science to if I want to make a video or, or  what the next day, what I gotta do, like, oh, I gotta get up, I gotta, just like, life.  Yeah.  Just life is in my head.  Just zooming around.  And I'd rather just hear, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,  boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  How many times do you hear that in the middle of the night?  Oh, please.  Really?  Sometimes I throw on DVD. 
[00:29:30]  And just let it play through?  Like a Seinfeld DVD, play all episodes.  Right.  And then I wake up and the menu's going, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  You think all that shit is soaking into you, too?  Yeah.  That's me.  Look.  Subconsciously, is this soaking into your brain?  Not a bitch!  No, not at all.  What are you talking about?  This is what I hear all night long.  I can't get it out.  Look, I'm getting drowsy.  Yeah.  I put on my puffy shirt and I run out to my car. 
[00:30:00]  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  It's wonderful.  Hey, before we move on from this, I want to ask Jimmy, humor and tragedy.  Like, what's acceptable?  Because some people do use humor to deal with tragedy.  I mean, even in my own family, you know, when you have a horrible event that happens  and maybe you're at a wake or something, there's humor going on and there's a dead body in the  front of the room.  So where does it go too far for people?  It's the same thing as anything else.  It's like people's self-righteousness comes into play. 
[00:30:30]  Yes.  And when it violates what they hold, what they find inappropriate, they want something done.  They don't.  Up until that point, they're the ones laughing.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Because anything you make fun of, I'd say 90% of the things negatively affect somebody.  Yep.  Innocent jokes.  Mm-hmm.  I got pulled over by a cop.  Maybe you shouldn't do that because a lot of people are killed drunk, dry.  Sure.  It's like you can't respect any of that shit.  Sure.  We've said it our entire careers, you know, every time we make a joke, someone out there 
[00:31:00]  is getting offended.  By something.  And, you know, you just can't worry about that shit.  Yeah.  I personally, it makes me crazy.  Well, what about this Japanese thing?  Is it okay to make jokes?  Of course it is.  I think so too.  Of course it is.  Can you expect Leno or Letterman?  Of course, those guys can't do it at this point.  And of course not.  Because when you're in that job, you understand that the advertisers are there.  Well, they're in a tough spot.  They're not dumb.  They're in a tough spot.  That's like a 9-11 thing.  When is it going to be okay for mainstream?  It's going to be never.  Nah, Leno and those guys, and all the guys that are on network television, they can't 
[00:31:30]  make fun of 9-11.  They can't make fun of any of this stuff.  They have to totally stay away from it.  They can reference it peripherally, I think, even in a joke.  They've got to be real terrible.  So this is off limits for those guys?  Yeah, because there's just too much money to be lost.  And it's a decision they make.  See, I'm not a fan when something really sad happens in your life that you make sure you  get down to the lowest level of sadness.  I try to raise that sadness as best I can.  I don't understand these people that have to make sure, no, man, we're not sad enough. 
[00:32:00]  Let's keep sad.  Let's put the montage on of all the sad music as we're at the wake for this person.  You know, all that shit.  It's like, no, man.  Come on.  Let's lift this up a little bit.  This is fucking horrible as is.  And Gallo's humor is fucking the best.  There's nothing that makes you laugh harder.  And again, Gilbert is not in the situation like the cops at Gacy's house were.  When they were pulling bodies out of John Wayne Gacy's house, they were laughing.  Yeah.  They were joking about it.  Because it's that part of you that takes this fucking horrible shit. 
[00:32:30]  Well, he was a clown.  That's funny.  Of course he was.  They probably saw some paintings on the wall.  Ah, look at that.  He's got a big red nose.  But they were saying stuff like they would pull out a severed head or something.  Say like, hey, he ain't got nobody to go to the prom with.  You know, like jokes like that.  Wow.  Is that a real joke?  That's a funny joke.  I read that.  But you're pulling out some 19-year-old's head.  That's tragic.  And I'm not saying Gilbert was in that situation, but he's got that humor.  And that's to me the stuff I've always thought was funniest.  Yeah.  Was the horrible. 
[00:33:00]  But it's like, as long as I keep it on myself, too.  I use it against myself.  It's not like I victimize everybody else and want myself off limits.  Right.  Can you balance humor and being respectful?  Yeah.  Absolutely.  As far as this situation goes?  Sure.  Like if I saw a Japanese person, would I purposely do something that was like, hey, Japan had an earthquake?  No, because I know I'm being an asshole.  It's only emotive.  Yeah, that's just hurting somebody.  But why, again, I've said it a million times, not one actor will ever have to justify why he plays a villain or why he plays somebody in a movie about a tsunami. 
[00:33:30]  How about every fucking Hollywood film about a tsunami?  How about those actors and directors and producers be penalized because they've made millions off an insensitive subject?  Right.  Never going to happen.  But, no, don't make fun of it because you're a pig.  It fucking drives me nuts.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Very good.  So let's see the next time an actor gets in trouble for capitalizing or the news showing more footage.  Hey, I understand we like to look at it, but how is it really helping? 
[00:34:00]  You're making advertising dollars showing that water rushing through with bodies in it.  Yeah, they're like, oh, this is tragic.  They come back from it and they're like, oh, just dramatic images we're seeing there.  Very tragic.  But they're masturbating behind the scenes.  Oh, they're loving it.  They're like, holy shit, we got more video to show everybody.  They're loving it.  But on the other end of it, I'm loving this shit.  Yeah.  I love these big events.  When you take the human loss out of it, it's an amazing action movie thing because you're seeing what we pay for in movies. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  Destruction.  Yeah.  Fucking pandemonium.  Yeah.  All kinds of shit.  But, you know, obviously real people died in this.  And I think we all understand that.  But as humans and we have our curiosity, our voyeuristic side, we want to see this.  Yeah, I don't know.  What do you think the reporters are thinking when they're reporting on this?  They love the fact that something's going on.  They love it.  That they don't have to go into.  It's like when we come in to do this show and something happened where we're like, god damn, 
[00:35:00]  this is at least an hour of gold today.  Right.  And it makes it all more exciting.  It makes the day easier and fun and like that.  These, for the news, it's like, wow, we don't even have to work today.  We got our experts lined up.  We got a whole fucking day where we're just going to talk about this.  We got our nuclear guy.  We got our physicist.  And I think that's exactly how they're looking at it.  They're working.  They're not genuinely sitting there.  Do you think that news woman that's going, just tragic, dramatic images.  Do you think she's home all day for the rest of the hour? 
[00:35:30]  She's home just sitting around the house going, oh, my God.  Oh, it's got tragedy.  Oh, it's tragedy.  I was saying over the weekend, I don't want my news from a woman that got up two hours earlier  to fucking, you know, roll out her hair and put her makeup on and stuff.  And she's laughing with the hair girl in the seat.  Of course.  I want a guy that has bed head and has a holy shit look on his face.  Just got up?  Yes.  I really do.  Like network?  You want to look like Peter Finch? 
[00:36:00]  Peter Finch just, ah, shit's happening.  Because I've noticed every single news outlet, their main anchor is a really good looking woman.  They have moved completely to good looking women.  Every single one.  There was a time it was kind of half and half, but now it's like the main spot is for the  good looking woman that is all dialed up.  Why not one fat woman?  Why is it not one fat woman as a major news anchor?  You know, forgive the pun. 
[00:36:30]  But I mean, why not?  Why not one obese person?  I want a fatty pig fatty.  Why not?  Because they have to be attractive.  And is that policy?  Is that policy that's in their little handbook?  And by the way, do they accept advertising dollars?  Of course they do.  So they're showing these Japanese videos.  They're accepting money and they're rating.  Get the fuck out of here.  So irritating.  Wow, that's a big explosion.  Yeah, see when they're showing video of an explosion like that, I want to go back to  the guy that just woke up. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  Ah, run!  He hasn't had time to shave.  No.  You know he has bad breath and he's giving you the news.  Run for your lives.  I want that guy again.  Not one fat anchor.  These women are great to look at, but it's fucking weird.  Not one fat anchor.  Not one obese female is an anchor.  And I don't get it.  And they're the first ones to throw people under the bus for saying inappropriate things  or being insensitive or being...  And they'll all be all over the government.  Ah, it's terrible that he said.  Ah, it's terrible. 
[00:37:30]  And they're hiring him.  Boy, the fat pigs end of the line.  I know the question is, is it...  I feel guilty that I don't respect the good-looking women on TV doing the news.  The reason I think...  Is that bad?  No, because you don't respect the good-looking women because that's all there are.  And you know why they have their jobs.  If there was a healthy mix, then you'd figure, hey, look, the best got the gig.  But it doesn't look like that.  It doesn't look like there's a healthy mix.  They're sending a hot blonde over to fucking Egypt.  Right.  That's what the news is doing.  Even the guys are good-looking.  Anderson Cooper's a handsome dude. 
[00:38:00]  Geraldo.  They're all fucking good-looking guys except the really old ones.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  They're all fucking chiseled chin.  I guess we have to have a pretty face to hear that there's fucking 10,000 people killed  in the tsunami.  And the older ones, they just keep pushing out, you know.  Yeah.  Fox Business.  Fox Business News or something.  Oh, yeah.  They ship them off to the old business news.  Yeah.  They get rid of the old guys.  The peripheral stations.  That actually no journalism.  Yeah.  Don't just read it off the teleprompter.  That didn't get just some silly communication degree somewhere and said, all right, you get 
[00:38:30]  to read the news for our big network.  Yeah.  And these lazy assholes will leave their little, what is it, a chyron?  Their little things at the bottom of the screen while they're showing tsunami footage.  And I was talking to this guy, Dave Anthony, I worked with in San Francisco.  We were watching in the dressing room.  They're showing tsunami footage.  And I'm like, how fucking annoying is it that half the footage is lost?  And he's like, it drives me nuts.  These lazy motherfuckers.  Oh, fucker, it's more important to see ABC or CBS or Fox than it is to see the footage 
[00:39:00]  of bodies being washed out.  Right.  And wouldn't it be easy just to fade that shit in and out?  Yeah.  Depending.  Like right now when you're doing a dumb weather thing, who cares?  Put it whatever you want on.  But when you have amazing tsunami footage, you know, get all that shit off the screen.  By the way, they don't have it during the weather.  No, when the weather, it's not there.  When the weather, they just put the ticker on the bottom with the lotto numbers and stuff.  There's a lot of stuff going on there right now.  No, no, but Watts, when they come back, because they want you to see the weather, they will  put an entire fucking graphic, a bottom third, they will pop up there, and you won't be able 
[00:39:30]  to see shit.  It is infuriating, and there should be some job it is to fucking fade that out when they're  showing footage.  Yeah, they're just lazy, mass production assholes.  We might have to give Fox 29 and Philly some credit today.  Let me go to Bill.  What's up, Bill?  Hey, good morning, boys.  Can we look up Fox 29 affiliate, Danny?  Fox 29.  Go ahead, Bill.  Sue Cereo, the weather girl, but she fills in as the anchor sometimes. 
[00:40:00]  She's enormous.  Really?  They got a fat broad.  Oh, good.  Okay.  Well, I didn't think this was possible.  It's extraordinarily rare.  I'm sure maybe it does exist, but it's a rare thing, but I guess that's kind of good  to hear.  And what's her name?  Her name is Sue Cereo.  Fatty pig fatty.  Sue Cereo.  How do you spell Cereo?  I don't have a clue.  Sue Cereo.  Cereo.  Dan, dan.  We got to see what she looks like.  And as an added bonus, she likes the black cock.  Oh, well, we don't know that.  How do you know that?  Who doesn't? 
[00:40:30]  Come on.  Because by process of elimination, we all like the black cock.  She should be one of us.  Yeah, we don't see her on the list of people that work in that.  There you go.  Let's see.  Hold on.  Has Annie look a little bit.  She's there.  There we go.  All right.  She's.  Wow.  Come on.  We're talking fat.  She's not obese, dude.  She's just heavy.  She's big boned a little bit.  She's a BBW.  If that.  All right.  It's a start.  I'm sure some of the listeners will beat me.  That is not what we're talking about.  All right.  We're talking about that pudgy face, double chin, fucking pig nose look. 
[00:41:00]  All right.  Our goal is to find the fattest person working in.  Fattest person working in.  Female.  As an anchor.  Yeah.  Or male either.  You get a few Ira Jo Fisher.  There's a few fucking blimps, but.  Yeah.  I'm mostly female.  Because, I mean, females have to be really.  Not wacky weather.  Really good looking and put together.  Yeah.  We want.  We want the chubbiest or ugliest anchor woman in America today.  That's.  We'll do that today.  A little side bit.  All right.  Real heinous.  Real heinous.  Heinous is what we're looking for. 
[00:41:30]  Okay.  Want to take our first break?  Because the next thing I want to bring up is going to take some time.  Sure.  Did you see the God girl that's going around?  I did not.  Oh, my God.  Is she fucking.  Just a lunatic.  Just a fucking.  This religion thing is just insane.  It's crazy.  And I really did lose another pair of sunglasses.  And it's fucking.  I'm obsessed with how dumb I am.  That's a shame.  How'd you lose it?  Hell no.  I went to the Apple store.  I don't know.  Did you take them off and put them down somewhere? 
[00:42:00]  Well, obviously they didn't jump off my face.  What do you think?  They made a break for it?  Of course I did.  Made a break for it.  Yeah, they did.  They fucking saw a truck.  And they hid under it like a convict and went to the Ray-Ban store.  Kenny?  Not your brand new sunglasses you just bought in San Francisco.  Oh, no.  By the way, as he's talking, I'm just wishing that his teeth would fall out like chiclets.  Yes, those ones.  Oh, no.  Oh.  I'm sad.  You just bought them then.  Of course I did.  Why wouldn't I have? 
[00:42:30]  Were they good ones?  They still had new sunglasses smell.  Hey.  Aw.  We owe Bill and Philly an apology because we just found.  Oh, Bill.  We just found another picture of Sue Serio, and she certainly is shaped like a pear.  She's bottom heavy, so they only showed a top part of her.  She is shaped like a pear.  Yeah.  That's a perfect example of a iceberg.  Yeah.  Above the anchor desk, she looks good.  Kind of like an iceberg does.  That is what's floating above the water.  Certain people in certain communities do enjoy that look.  She's got blonde hair, big ass. 
[00:43:00]  Big ol' ways.  Yeah, so you could see.  Let's see how to another guy in Philly.  Looks like Philly likes the fat broads for their news.  Who's this?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, real quick.  In college.  Time's up.  I worked for a news station in Philly, a big one.  And it is true because whenever there was bad weather coming in, a certain meteorologist  that wears a bow tie and is very dewy would run up and down the newsroom screaming because 
[00:43:30]  he knew it equaled ratings and he would be on the air a lot longer.  And one more thing was we had an older anchor and she was demoted because every time before  air, she would put her lipstick on and it would end up on her teeth.  And they finally fired her for that?  I think they demoted her to like the hour where no one watches it, but I definitely remember  that.  It was quite awkward trying to talk to her when she had lipstick all over her teeth.  And I still don't know where they are or how it happened. 
[00:44:00]  I will say, though, that I temporarily have two iPads and right now I'm doing the 3G test  for both.  I saw you tweeted about the test.  Yeah, I'm just doing that.  And in my house, Verizon wins, hands down.  Yeah.  Right here, AT&T is better.  Wow!  AT&T is better right here.  It's faster.  See, I do believe it will always be like that with these services.  Well, we'll see.  Yeah, I'm going to be in a few different states over the next week.  Jimmy's doing his own fucking test.  Well, only because I haven't gotten rid of my old iPad yet. 
[00:44:30]  I'll cancel it in a couple weeks.  What are you going to do with it?  I'll probably give it to, oh, that was a surprise.  Oh, okay.  I was going to sell it, but I'll give it to somebody who I care about.  Oh.  I never give away anything.  You know what?  No, I'm kidding.  I do give away a lot, but I'm not giving away any of my electronics.  I'll give away the old iPad.  I might do that.  I'm going to do it with two of them.  I might do that.  My girlfriend uses mine.  I'm not going to give it to her.  I've given her enough.  Here's a load.  You're welcome.  You're welcome.  An eye load.  Yeah, it's a beverage and a meal.  E-Y-E. 
[00:45:00]  Hey, can we look up Kim Fetty in Kansas?  Kim Fetty?  Kim Fetty.  Oh, I thought that was a wacky radio name.  Hey, Kim Fetty with you in the morning.  Kim Fetty.  Having a good time.  A bunch of people called about Kim Fetty.  Kim Fetty.  They said, no, she's fat and she has a mole.  F-E-D-D-Y.  I think they said.  If they were spelling it right on the phones.  Oh, no.  That one doesn't look that bad. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, that's Kim Kardashian.  What the fuck?  Yeah, exactly.  She's like five pictures in.  Kim Fetty.  Fuck.  Fucking people hung up, too.  So now we can't get more info.  Oh, sugar.  Because then if we had the channel, then we would get to her.  Yeah, all right.  No problem.  You've got to call back with Kim Fetty because we need more info on that.  Kim Fetty.  My grandmother would always say that when she was mad.  Oh, sugar.  Oh, sugar.  And it's like, you mean shit, grandma.  Exactly.  No, then I'd look and she'd be making coffee and I'd realize I'd curse for no reason.  And she'd squeeze my balls with her fingernails. 
[00:46:00]  To punish me.  We're going to go with Jackie Simeon in Texas.  Don, what's up?  All right.  Anna, love this one.  You need to look up Jackie Simeon in Beaumont, Texas.  Jackie Simeon in Beaumont, Texas.  Let's take a look at her.  She's a beef.  That's her?  Wow.  I wonder what network she's on.  Yeah.  All right, fella.  I got you.  Yeah, she fits the criteria. 
[00:46:30]  That just has to be embarrassing.  She's not that bad.  She's like a Sue Simmons type of chick.  Yeah, Sue Simmons is way better looking than that, bro.  But just short hair and kind of mushy.  She's not terrible.  Yeah.  That'd be like if my name was Anthony Dago.  Hey.  I mean, it's just really just bad.  It's not?  No.  I wish it was, though.  No, there should be a comma between those two words.  Anthony Dago.  I am.  Somebody was making fun of me.  I was like, Jesus Christ, Anthony.  You got more marble in your house than a quarry, you fucking wop. 
[00:47:00]  I think that's what people call me the most, fucking wop on Twitter.  Because any time I have a picture of the inside of my house, I got my columns and my marble.  I'm very fucking, I'm a fucking Dago.  You got a lot of Italian shit going on.  I don't, but I don't, people often question, I don't have cement lions outside my house.  Why not?  I did not pave or cement over my front lawn, which Italians have been known to do.  It's just the backyard. 
[00:47:30]  Just the backyard.  I did.  Backyard's a lot of cement.  Well, the backyard's a lot because it's a whole big deck area.  I don't consider it like just taking cement and smearing it around.  I didn't put a giant wall up around a quarter acre house, like some Italians like to do, with  a gate, like the Corleone compound they think they have.  Well, you still have time to get some of that stuff done.  The big lions, there's no fountains of pissing children, things like that.  I like the real thing. 
[00:48:00]  You got so many marbles in this house, you should be out in the back shooting Jaspers or something.  Whatever, fucking millionaire.  Let's go to Joe in Tennessee.  Joe, help us out, Joe.  What's happening, man?  What's up, Joe?  You need to look at WCYB.  The whole newscast is back.  WCYB?  They're digging this.  Chubby.  Wow.  We got one guy, his anchor name is Johnny Wood, and he's freaking huge. 
[00:48:30]  Wood.  Yeah, but we want ugly broads because I think it's almost impossible for him.  Well, look, they're all guys on there.  His co-anchor is huge.  Huge.  Her name is Tabitha something.  I can't remember what her name is.  Stevens?  She's huge on the bottom and the top.  She's got a real tall face.  She looks like a, I don't know, some toy.  You hear that?  She's got a real tall face.  I don't think I've ever heard that before.  Well, her upper body's tall, but her face is real small, and her head's real small,  but her lower body's just pretty small.  Like Sarah Jessica Parker face? 
[00:49:00]  It's worse.  By the way, I saw Sarah Jessica Parker in a makeup commercial.  Odd, right?  It's beyond the point where she should be doing anything on any visual media.  Well, are they actually doing it on her, or are they using her like the fucking paint  guns in an auto shop?  It, oh yeah, the Ellen DeGeneres fucking, uh, commercial?  Cover girl commercial is ridiculous.  Why?  Because she should not be doing it.  She looks bad?  Yeah. 
[00:49:30]  Well, she thinks she looks beautiful.  Cover girl with her is something different.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cover pussy with face girl.  That's the only covering she's having.  Cover vagina with belt that looks like penis?  It's like, come on, dude.  Yeah.  What is she saying?  Well, she's saying shit.  That's why I use cover girl's new Simply Ageless makeup with Olay Regenerous Serum.  A department store brand can glob up in lines and wrinkles and actually make you look older.  Simply Ageless stays suspended over lines and makes you look amazing. 
[00:50:00]  So I say new Simply Ageless from Olay, an easy breezy, beautiful cover girl.  Which camera?  Because there's two.  I understand she's kind of spoofing the whole model thing.  But.  But it is cover girl.  It is for makeup.  At the end of the day, you're supposed to look at her.  Right, right.  Oh, she looks so good.  I'm going to buy that makeup.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's doing it her way, guys.  I'm not feeling that.  I'm not looking at Ellen DeGeneres in a makeup commercial going, oh, she's.  No.  You're also not a lesbian, though. 
[00:50:30]  That's being sold to women who are kind of.  But it's all in the Target demo and people love Ellen so much.  Her audience is not all fucking supermodels.  She has like a lot of older, like fat women.  Oh, yeah.  You see her audience.  They're all manatees.  They're a disaster.  So they look at her and they're like, oh, that'll be fun to be like Ellen.  And they go out and they put on their faces and they get syrup on it.  Like if Ellen can do it, so can we.  I get syrup on it.  Bunch of fucking sea cows.  They're there with that bright lipstick on the coffee cup at a Denny's.  Yeah.  The fucking, one of those Grand Slam breakfasts in front of them. 
[00:51:00]  Bunch of otters.  They don't even have arms to put their makeup on.  They have to just rub their face in like big seals.  God damn, my sunglasses.  Oh, I can't believe you just bought them in San Fran.  I'm such a jerk off.  Where do you think they are?  On someone's face.  On someone's face right now.  It might be in the pharmacy.  We found Kim Setti.  Oh.  We have a winner.  Wow.  We have a new leader and the ugliest women anchor in America. 
[00:51:30]  Arnold Schwarzenegger's in there.  Two weeks.  Kim Setti is a disaster.  Yeah, she's a pig.  She has that old fucking hairdo.  Wow.  Oh my God.  Who would you rather in this picture?  Oh God.  What do you have when you have a blue whale and a Kim?  You have a Kim Setti.  Because it's a set of two.  Yes, of course.  I would call her Kim Yeti. 
[00:52:00]  See, because they're big.  Or Kim Yeti, because her pussy is as disgusting as an oil spill.  Couldn't take her anything else.  Whatever, it's fine.  Uh-oh.  How about Kim Spaghetti, because she eats a lot.  Oh, boy.  Kim Setti talks about her cancer.  It always happens.  This is Kim Setti Alpha 5.  Oh, she has cancer?  She has a planet.  What?  She has cancer.  Oh, no.  Of what?  Why can't God keep it fun for us? 
[00:52:30]  He always has to throw us a curveball.  What do you mean?  I thought that's what he was doing.  Where does she have it?  Maybe it's an easy cancer.  Which one is it?  No, breast.  Oh, Jesus.  All right.  Well, we wish Kim Setti all the best.  Fuck.  Best.  Yes.  All right.  Let's just cut our losses.  Let's move on.  Now it's just sad.  I know.  It really is terrible.  So ironic. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  Setti.  Setti.  Jesus.  Jesus.  No.  No.  No one say that.  We're taking a break.  Yeah.  Why don't we do that?  I'm taking a break.  Holy shit, Danny.  You are fucking horrid.  He's laughing.  I'm laughing.  We're all laughing.  Sure we are.  I'll be laughing to the fucking unemployment line.  Yeah.  I'll be laughing to the bank, too. 
[00:53:30]  No.  See, that would make sense.  I hope you slip on your marble and crack your teeth.  Scumbag.  Nothing for chipper.  No.  Serious.  The virus.  Yeah.  This is the O.P.  Anthony Show.  Damn it.  Destroyer.  35 years ago today.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's why we're playing this. 
[00:54:00]  Fuck.  Speaking of rock and roll, I want to give Eddie Trunk a plug real fast.  He just sent us his new book.  Damn thing looks really fucking good, man.  Really good.  Yeah.  Where's my book, E-Rock?  E-Rock came in with a package that usually we get books in.  And he goes, here's another book you're never going to read. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  And then I opened it up.  Because usually they're shite.  I opened it up and I said, it's Eddie Trunk's book.  Eddie Trunk, a central hard rock and heavy metal forward by Rob Halford.  And it is a picture book, man.  I think the rear would be by Rob Halford, not the forward.  Get it?  Because he likes ass.  Because he likes it in the rear.  What do you think?  I like it.  There's a great mix of fantastic pictures, but still a lot of text.  And every page is colorful. 
[00:55:00]  Very colorful.  You know what I mean?  That's a bright, festive book he's got there.  Don't think book when you think Eddie Trunk's book.  No.  You know what I mean?  It's all pictures.  And then the writing's over the pictures, that type of thing.  Yeah, yeah.  The writing on the side.  Half the page is writing.  Half the page is a picture.  And the writing's over the picture.  Picture, picture, picture.  This looks real good, man.  I think it's going to do well for Eddie.  Is that a coffee table book?  In between a coffee table book and a regular book.  And a regular book?  In between.  Is it a pop-up? 
[00:55:30]  It's not a pop-up.  It's like pop-up books.  How exciting was it to have a pop-up book when you were a kid?  Real exciting.  It was so exciting.  I loved pop-up books.  See, that's where you've got to have a kid, because then you get to relive all that stuff.  Because guess what?  Yeah.  I got pop-up books again.  Do you got pop-up books?  Yes, I do.  We have to turn the page and it's like, well, how'd they figure that out?  My kid doesn't care, but I'm like, wow, this makes a mountain.  It made a castle.  I love it.  I swear to God, I love it.  Are you digging the pop-up book?  Because it brings me right back. 
[00:56:00]  Wow.  I can't believe how big this page just got.  And do they have the little tabs that you pull so that things happen?  I'm all in.  Like a little boat moves.  It's like I'm eight years old again.  Yeah.  Eight, whatever.  Whatever it was.  Probably before that, right?  Probably at eight.  It's like I'm 15 again.  I know.  Yeah, maybe you shouldn't be reading pop-up books at eight, right?  I don't know.  I think I was still digging pop-up books at like seven, eight.  Pop-up books were awesome, but they always got fucked up.  Yeah. 
[00:56:30]  Quickly.  Yeah.  Kids like tugging at the fucking pop-up part.  You tug at the flaps too hard.  The flap thingy.  It doesn't work properly.  Yeah.  You don't want to tug at those flaps hard.  They don't like that.  No, they don't, do they now?  Yeah, the pop-up book.  So, Eddie Trout, where can people get that?  Is that everywhere?  I think we got an advanced copy.  Eddie Trout's new book came in today.  Yeah, I think it's pretty cool.  Oh, I've seen.  This thing looks really good.  It's phenomenal.  He showed me when I was taping that metal show.  There's photos in there of the bands that no one has seen before. 
[00:57:00]  Right.  Because a friend of his is a photographer.  It's fucking cool.  Yeah, a lot of great photographs.  A lot of great photos in this thing.  Yeah, I was very impressed.  Yeah.  It's going to do well.  All right.  Hey, can we play that video?  Oh, yeah.  This crazy young girl.  She's a young girl.  Young girl.  Somebody tweeted this last night.  Abigail.  Abigail in the fucking cough syrup.  And I didn't feel like retweeting this last night.  Yeah.  But now we're going to talk about it on our show. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  This is a little fucking twat of a girl.  How old do you think she is?  She's got to be 14, 15.  Wait till you see this one, Jimmy.  And this video is going to be everywhere today.  It's doing very well.  Very well.  Brains washed, I'm sure.  Here we go.  So it's called Insane Girl.  Overjoyed.  I want to read that.  Overjoyed about Japan earthquake.  A sign from gas. 
[00:58:00]  What does she think?  It's revelation or something?  Yeah, yeah.  So she's very happy about the whole thing.  She's a little twatty high school girl.  God is such an amazing God.  He is so good and so loving.  And it's amazing to see how fast God answers prayer sometimes.  Sometimes.  On Wednesday at the start of Lent, believers all over the world came together.  And we have been praying specifically for God to open the eyes of atheists all over the world. 
[00:58:30]  Literally in every corner, in every direction, any place that there is an atheist,  we've been praying for God to open their eyes and to see that there really is a God,  that he does exist, that he loves them, and that he is the God of the Bible,  that the Bible is true.  And just a few days, not even a few days later, God shook the country of Japan.  He literally grabbed the country by the shoulders and said,  Hey, look, I'm here.  Where are the shoulders on Japan?  Oh, it's just so amazing to see how God can just answer prayers like this. 
[00:59:00]  And I am just so overjoyed and so encouraged.  For the rest of this Lentil season, I'm going to be praying even harder than I have ever before.  And, I mean, with just one day of prayer, with two days of prayer to see God literally waking people up  and saying, You are going to hell, just imagine what will happen at the end of the 40 days.  My brothers and sisters, I thank you so much for praying with me.  And if you haven't started praying for atheists to open their eyes and to turn from their ways, 
[00:59:30]  it's never too late to start.  You can pray right now.  Just pause the video, get on your knees, and pray to God.  I pray that she walks out and gets hit by a car at the end of this Lent season.  Made in Japan.  Oh, my God.  I can't even think how vengeful he's going to be on America because we have a lot of atheists in America.  I mean, Japan is a fantastic place to start. 
[01:00:00]  But, I mean, once he hits Europe, once he hits America, it's just going to be crazy.  It's going to be insane.  Well, ironically enough, she's the next voice of the affleck talk.  You better be ready because by the time Easter comes, every person will know that God is real.  The Bible says that on that day, every knee shall bow and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.  God, I thank you so much. 
[01:00:30]  I thank you for your amazing love, for your ability to answer prayers so fast.  God, you are such an amazing, awesome heart.  Can you have a conversation with this child?  I don't object to what she's saying.  I am just so encouraged.  She's a bore.  I just want to pray all day long.  I bet you do.  I hope you will all do the same.  God, you are so good.  I love you, God.  You are so amazing.  Wow.  She's fucking encouraged. 
[01:01:00]  Be encouraged, my brothers and sisters.  God does.  Sounds like you talking to your 50 cal.  That is a direct answer to our prayers.  Point taken.  I am just so overjoyed.  I can't even contain my joy.  Let's get back to praying.  All right, listen.  Back to praying.  Listen, before we comment, there's a guy on the line that's saying this video right now  is fake.  Why is that?  But why would you fucking do a fake video like that?  Yeah.  Let me see if this guy has any info. 
[01:01:30]  Does she have other videos?  Let me say hi to Eric in North Carolina.  Eric.  Hey, Eric.  What's going on?  Amen.  Yeah, that video is completely fake.  It's called a Poe.  And Poe's law states that the most absurd things that Christians say, you can't tell if they're  just messing with you or not because, you know, that's just completely absurd from the  stuff they say.  I'm actually a subscriber of this chick on YouTube.  Yeah.  All kinds of crazy stuff.  And in one of her videos announcing evolution, she's wearing a pro-evolution shirt. 
[01:02:00]  So, I mean, it's completely fake.  It's fake?  Maybe.  But wait.  Wait, I'm really confused.  Is the pro-evolution shirt sarcastic or the...  Yeah.  Like, what is the point of her videos then?  I need more info.  Because, I mean, there's a lot of people that basically want to strangle her when they  see something like that.  Go to her fucking page.  I want to see what other vids she's got.  Yeah, I think she's just screwing with people.  You know, there's trolls all over YouTube just putting stuff out there just to mess with people. 
[01:02:30]  What is a troll?  That's somebody that said something.  Look in a mirror.  Hold on, sir.  I just...  I really...  If I had a chin, I would have led with it on that one.  I can't believe I just...  Oh, Jimmy.  I'm kidding.  No, no, no.  But I actually...  I didn't even lob that up.  I blew up a balloon and I tapped it.  But what is a troll?  It's someone that just said something inflammatory to get a response out of people.  And she's clearly doing well at that.  Okay, so what is she doing in this one? 
[01:03:00]  But isn't she getting...  But she's getting people to hate her.  That's her right there, right?  She's making fun of Christian, I guess.  There's other video.  I'm just looking for her channel itself.  It seems that other people post her stuff a lot.  Yeah?  Click that.  What is she saying there real quick?  Let's listen.  Good morning, YouTube.  I had another interesting dream last night.  And the details of the dream were not important.  Important. 
[01:03:30]  Sorry for the mess.  I just woke up.  And I wanted to share this with you as soon as possible.  So, um, but yesterday I was thinking about how a lot of, a lot of atheists have been bombarding  my channel, have been bombarding my videos, and just saying really cool things about God,  about Jesus, about my Father, my Heavenly Father.  And I have a question for all of you.  For all of you atheists out there. 
[01:04:00]  If God doesn't exist, who wrote the Bible?  Okay.  She's fucking...  Think about that one.  She's fucking with everybody, I think.  Yeah, that makes it clear she's just screwing around right here.  Yeah, I think she's just fucking with everybody.  It could be...  I think she's completely anti-religion.  I think she's an atheist, and I think she's taking the other way to show how ridiculous  it is.  I think.  I think. 
[01:04:30]  I need to see more information.  We need to see her channel.  What's her name?  Like, how...  You said you, um...  You subscribed?  Subscribed to her.  What's her channel name?  What's her channel name?  I can't remember.  Yeah, I'm in the car right now.  I put in I can't remember, Danny.  I can't remember.  Who's got that on YouTube?  Can we look at the I can't remember page?  I can't remember.  You know someone has it.  Of course they do.  Fuck. 
[01:05:00]  All right.  Watch it out.  All right, man.  Thanks.  Vince in Bayonne writes, just found Poe's Law, which is, without a winking, smiley, or  other blatant display of humor, it is impossible to create a parody of fundamentalism that someone  won't mistake for the real thing.  Poe's Law.  I thought Poe's Law was created after a night at FH.  Yes, Poe's Law.  Ah.  Ah.  So wait, who's Poe?  I didn't know there was a real thing called Poe's Law, but he says, once again, without 
[01:05:30]  a winking, smiley, or other blatant display of humor, it is impossible to create a parody  of fundamentalism that someone won't mistake for the real thing.  Uh-huh.  So she's goofing on it, but you can't tell that she's goofing on it.  You can't tell because she doesn't break character in it.  That's really confusing to me.  Nah, but you know what?  Poe's Law...  What is Poe's Law based on?  What that's saying is, basically, if there's no smile or wink or any type of humor, then  you could just be reciting what they say. 
[01:06:00]  That's not fucking parody.  Meaning, like, if I just stood here, and I just, say I read, like, uh, I just started  doing Klan lines and things like that, or whatever it was, and then all of a sudden  I said, ah, they say, you didn't get it.  That's a parody.  Well, what in that tells you it's a parody if I don't give you anything to say it?  Yeah, I agree.  Because...  So do I.  So, that video's got a lot of people hating her for the wrong reason if she actually believes 
[01:06:30]  the opposite point of view, right?  Right.  So that's confusing to me.  Yeah.  Is it a parody if there's no sense of parody to it?  Well, Poe's Law says yes.  Ah!  But who's Poe?  He used to do security, remember?  Poe sounds like he's a fool.  Poe's Law.  If there is not a dojo on a cement foundation...  There's a lot of Poe's Law videos, I guess, huh?  Yeah, I guess so.  And to answer your question, John Cryer is a troll.  We all know that. 
[01:07:00]  What?  Thanks to Charlie Sheen.  John Cryer.  Oh.  All right.  Trolls.  Winning.  What?  I don't know.  Do you know there are still people that are hashtagging winning on Twitter?  Really?  Yeah.  I'm just like...  And that idiot is actually closing in on three million fucking followers.  Good for him.  He has nothing to say, though.  I know.  There's a shitload of celebrities that have a lot of followers that have nothing to say.  Wait, what's he saying?  What's the new one?  Fastball.  Yeah, fastball.  Fastball.  Fastball.  Yeah, fastball.  Here it comes. 
[01:07:30]  Coming at you.  Something big.  Oh.  You're not that intense.  No.  You get a lot of money.  You did what a lot of people would do.  Yes.  Let's go to Boston, where Jimmy's going to be this weekend.  We'll be at the theater.  Only Friday.  Only Friday night.  Andy, what's up, buddy?  Hello.  Good morning.  Good morning, Andy.  Hello.  Hello.  Hey.  Did you guys see the YouTube video when a kid fully pushes a kid so far?  A kid that's getting bullied and body slams his kid onto his neck. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I like the one thing ten times.  You guys, did you see it?  Yeah, that's been given to me like 800 times.  Yeah, but I want to play for Jimmy.  Yeah, play for Jimmy.  I'm just looking out, guys.  I know you probably saw it, but I was in awe at this thing.  I can't believe that kid didn't break his neck.  Well, there's a couple problems with this video, by the way.  There's an update on the kid.  Well, let's play the video first, and then I'll give you the update.  Thanks, Andy.  I'd keep you on the line, but your phone's a little rough today.  Yeah, screw you.  All right.  This is the big bullying video that's going around.  You got a thin, twerpy kid punching a chubby kid at school. 
[01:08:30]  Just fucking giving him rights to the face.  And now he's getting cocky and doing some boxing moves in front of the fat kid.  Giving him some jabs in his belly.  And then the big fat kid says, all right, and lifts the kid up and body slams him head  first into the cement.  Fucks him up.  The kid is all fucked up.  He is all fucked up. 
[01:09:00]  That's funny.  He got fucking hurt.  He got fucking hurt.  That rules.  Fat kid said, fuck you.  All right.  Because he was letting him do his shit.  Yeah.  Pushed him too far.  The fat kid lifted the kid up off the ground, just body slant him, pretty much hitting his  head first and his leg.  So now, what are people saying about that?  I heard, if it's true, that the chubby kid that retaliated got suspended.  Oh, yeah?  How is that fair?  What did he get suspended for? 
[01:09:30]  Especially he got the video there.  He obviously was doing the right thing and not retaliating for the longest fucking time.  Yeah.  That's what I heard.  I don't know if there's a news story out there or whatever, but that's what was going  around the internet last night.  The excessive use of force there, based on what he was getting.  The kid was fucking giving him rights right to the face.  Nah, he should have then just punched him in the face.  He could have fucking broken that kid's neck.  I don't want to see the kid get his neck broken, but you know what?  If you're going to be stupid enough to throw punches in somebody's face, you get what you 
[01:10:00]  get.  I hear you.  And then the little twerpy kid was getting really cocky and doing that dancing.  Oh, that was funny.  Believe me.  Funny as fuck.  Boxing, dancing.  He laid him out.  And that big fucking rhino just jumped on him.  He couldn't even walk.  He stood up and he's all fucked up.  Dumb kids.  People want us to tweet that video.  You really haven't seen that one yet?  Videos every week.  Just get it.  Find it.  All right.  First person to search.  First person to send to me.  I'll just retweet it.  Give me a retweet today.  Search.  I want to bring something up, too, about the Billy the Bassman. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  Breaking news from yesterday.  Of course, we were talking about Billy the Bassman and how SNL did a bit.  That was, or a skit, or a sketch.  Sketch.  A sketch.  Sketch comedy.  Sketch.  Sketch.  About the kings of catchphrase comedy.  Yeah.  They did like that bit.  Sketch.  And we were like, you know, it's a little odd that they did that right on the heels of  us doing that.  Oh, boy.  We're wrong again.  Don't tell me that they had been doing that.  No, no.  They're not.  How wrong are we?  I just... 
[01:11:00]  We're always wrong in the end.  We're always wrong.  Our own beloved Eastside Dave...  Oh, yeah.  I know that.  ...did the exact same bit two years ago.  Yeah.  It was the same bit, dude.  Really?  Yeah.  I heard about it after the fact.  Yeah, so did I.  I didn't know.  And then somebody gave me the YouTube address, and I looked at it, and it's like, it's Davey  Red.  Is that the one he was doing?  Can we play a little of that?  Play some Davey Red. 
[01:11:30]  You do the same bit as Bob did?  Stash her away.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like really the same fucking bit.  Him doing like a Southern comic with a catchphrase.  What was his catchphrase, though?  I can't remember what it was.  Just pop it up there.  Needs a job?  You want that first?  Yeah, yeah.  Or you want this girl coming clean about her phony videos?  Yeah, we'll go back to her.  So what now?  David?  Yeah.  Davey Mac doing things?  Yeah.  Davey Red. 
[01:12:00]  Davey, uh, some, yeah.  Davey Red, I think.  Eastside Dave.  Yeah.  Davey Red.  Something like that.  Let's see what it is.  Eastside Dave.  The comic Davey Red.  The complete Davey Red collection.  What the fuck?  As soon as it went off.  All right.  Ron and Feigeo.  Because we've been talking about, we've got the Unmasked on, uh, someone on hiatus.  We've taken a little break from it while we are, uh, working out all the, uh, merger stuff. 
[01:12:30]  But the great thing about Unmasked is since I've had, uh, Patrice and Jimmy Norton and so  many different people do such great, uh, Jay Moore's Unmasked was phenomenal.  Louis Black's just, uh, terrific.  I could go on and on.  I don't want to leave anybody out.  But it's now become a hot ticket.  At first we had to ask all the comedians.  Now the comedians are calling us and, uh, we've never done an Unmasked with any of the 
[01:13:00]  Southern, uh, blue collar type comedians.  And, uh, one of them has contacted me.  Uh, he wants me to have more.  Now, are you all that familiar with those comedians, the blue collar guys?  I, I mean, I know, so I know Jeff Foxworthy.  This is easy, by the way.  We just play Rona Fez.  Well, there's many of them out there now.  Then we can just kick back.  A real, uh, spirited thing.  And they all have catchphrases.  They're fantastic.  They have catchphrases that they repeat.  Everybody loves them.  So, uh, one of the guys has asked me to be on. 
[01:13:30]  I said, I don't, I'm not, I'm not sure what I'm doing with Unmasked, but why don't you  just come in today and do the Rona Fez show.  So, let's, uh, please put our hands together for Davey Redd.  Davey Redd.  Davey Redd is here.  The comedy stylings.  Woo!  Thank you very much, Rona Fez.  It's good to be here.  Let it be known, everybody.  That's it.  Let it be known.  Let it be known.  Maybe it's a little similar.  I'll try out some of my material right here on the Rona Fez show, XM 202, Sirius 197.  First of all, my wife is a real pain in the rear. 
[01:14:00]  Spends money.  Other day, she got me some, she got herself some perfume.  I said, what kind is it?  She said, expensive.  I said, I never heard of that brand before.  Let it be known.  It's the same thing.  Where are we going?  I'll tell you one thing right now.  My doctor's a real screwball.  Was getting a physical when he said to me the other day, Davey Redd, I got some good news  and some bad news.  The good news is you have herpes. 
[01:14:30]  I said, Jesus, Doc.  What's the bad news?  He says, you have brain cancer.  Let it be known.  I love drinking, man.  Love it.  Love drinking to excess.  The other day, I was in my watering hole.  I said to the bartender, let's go.  Refill already.  Bartender said, sir, I'm not a bartender.  I'm a cashier.  And you're in a Home Depot.  You have a problem.  Let it be known. 
[01:15:00]  All right.  See, it's the same thing.  Oh, boy.  Let it be known.  My mistake.  Don't like politics very much.  Don't like them.  Bunch of people just yelling and making dirty pacts with one another.  It's like, let's make a deal.  Only if Monty Hall had the power to bomb Cambodia and cover up the Kennedy assassination.  Let's make a deal.  Let it be known.  All right.  Nothing, Dave.  But, dude, right? 
[01:15:30]  That's pretty similar.  That's pretty similar.  Did Bob come up with this?  Oh, yeah.  Bobby certainly did.  Yeah, it was just a...  It's parallel thinking.  What I like about that...  We just kind of grew into the bit as it was...  We were going on with the show that day.  Well, why don't we put the two together, man, and do a little show somewhere?  Should be.  Let it be known.  Let it be known.  Where are we going?  What that shows you is that Ronnie's no rat.  Ronnie could have bitched and complained on his show.  I know.  What the fuck is ONA doing?  I know.  He's no rat. 
[01:16:00]  He just let it be.  Let it be known.  Where are we going?  Yep.  That'll be their plug.  They'll be like, hey, why don't we let it be known where we're going?  That's the big tour.  Yeah.  Let it be known where we're going.  Let it be known where we're going tour.  Yeah.  So, you know, the incomparable.  Davey Mack.  Yeah.  Doing that character.  So you're trying to say SNL ripped off Davey Mack and not Bob Kelly.  Not so much.  I'm saying perhaps other people think of this genius without having to be influenced one  way or another. 
[01:16:30]  I have no idea.  How humiliating for all of us.  I know.  It really is.  It just is.  Let it be known.  Let it be known.  I kind of like that character.  Let it be known.  Let it be known.  Yeah.  And now we're going back to that other broad.  The crazy religious girl.  I guess Danny found her fessing up to it.  Fessing up to the fact that it's all fake.  And someone else is trying to tell us what Poe's Law is all about.  You want to know?  Ah.  I'm very confused by this Poe's Law. 
[01:17:00]  Justin in Texas.  Let it be known.  Hey.  What's going on, buddy?  What's up?  Hey.  I don't know everything about it.  I know it was created by a guy named Nathan Poe in August.  Fan Poe?  Wow.  That's weird.  It's getting weirder by the moment.  Nathan Poe.  August 2005.  There's actually a Wikipedia page about it.  Wow.  There's a Wikipedia page about everything.  Yes, sir.  Thank you.  I'm sure there's one about you by now, Justin.  I didn't think it was possible for someone to contribute less than I have to knowledge of 
[01:17:30]  this Poe.  And now he's gone.  All right, so I thought Nathan Poe was some guy that goes way, way back, not 2005 shit.  TamTamPamela?  That was her YouTube channel.  Comes Clean?  And she comes clean about her videos.  She's not 14, is she?  I don't know.  She looks a little older now.  Hey, guys.  It's Pamela.  It's college age, maybe.  I've been making troll videos for a while now, but this last one seems to have pissed off 
[01:18:00]  a lot of people, which was my intention.  But at this point, I'm kind of tired of pizza.  So, I'm going to let the cat out of the bag.  Come and clean.  And it was fun, guys.  So, yeah.  I guess I'll see you.  She must have got scared.  I bet you she got death threats or something.  She reminds me of somebody.  Oh, I bet.  Wow.  That was, like, just made, I gather?  Yeah.  Right after the Japanese thing, she looks petrified in that. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, she really does.  Wow.  Yeah, she's a familiar face.  Yeah, right?  Doesn't she sound like somebody?  I'm trying to write a movie off subject about someone who breaks into someone else's iPad  and gets a hold of their Fios DVR, and they just DVRs crazy shows.  Which one, Mike?  Is that why you're leaving us this week?  Like, you'll get home, and you'll go, I didn't want to see Hello, Larry.  No.  And there it is, the whole season. 
[01:19:00]  There it is.  Right there.  It's there, and there's nothing you can do about it.  Nothing you can do about it, but watch it.  Are you just spending your time pitching really weird ideas in Hollywood now?  Yes, I am.  You are.  I have a bunch of them.  That's one of them.  Breaks into the iPad, just does nothing but DVR crazy things, and erase their DVR stuff.  So what do you think, man?  Now is she fucking around by doing this?  No, no, no, no.  Okay, she's done.  She's been fucking around.  She's been fucking around.  Of course.  And now she's...  She got right to the point with this video.  Yeah, yeah.  She's like, look.  She's scared.  Let me get troll videos.  Let me get this out immediately.  I don't mean any of this shit. 
[01:19:30]  She's a scaredy cat.  You think her parents got a hold of this shit?  I don't know.  Somebody said, hey, I saw your fucking daughter, and you might want to check out her videos.  Probably at school.  She probably got two people.  Is this channel no longer available because the user closed their account?  Yeah, she got scared.  She shut down the whole fucking thing, huh?  She shouldn't have, though.  She was getting threats or whatever.  I bet she was getting threats.  Something got to her.  That's a fucked up thing.  The whole religion thing and disaster, you're stirring up some shit where people will take 
[01:20:00]  it very seriously and maybe try to kill you.  That's fucked up.  Yeah, no kidding.  Well, I went from hating her to really hating her.  I wanted to fuck her.  Yeah, and then you just look and go like, I'd throw one.  I'd fuck.  I would fuck her.  Fuck.  Why don't we take another break?  Oh.  Because we've got one more segment with Jimmy before he scoops out of here. 
[01:20:30]  Because I'm playing a game called Go to Bed, Wake Up.  What is Go to Bed, Wake Up?  Go to bed.  Wake up.  It didn't wake up.  It didn't wake up.  It's supposed to wake up when you open the little cover on the new one.  Go to bed.  iPad.  Wake up.  Wake up.  Hi.  Oh, it woke up.  Go to bed.  You're crazy.  I just opened and closed the iPad thing.  I pre-ordered Boats Down There from Amazon. 
[01:21:00]  It's on pre-order.  I was laughing so hard.  Is it on pre-order for real on Amazon?  Me and my chick were laughing so fucking hard at the awfulness of that title, Boats Down There.  Jimmy's coffee table book he wants to put out with pictures of just boats down there, I guess.  Take it from an aerial view.  Yes.  Or from a branch.  There's a six-page spread of rowboats in a lake somewhere in Jersey. 
[01:21:30]  Boats Down There.  It's the worst title.  I'm not sure how to write the title yet.  It might be Boats...  Down There.  That's good.  That's good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like it.  I was laughing at that last night, though.  Out of nowhere, it just hit me.  I'm just laughing.  Good book.  Boats Down There.  You're terrible at the title.  You think that's a bad title?  Oh, it's awful.  I wouldn't buy that book.  You don't understand that book.  I know.  Yeah.  It's despicable. 
[01:22:00]  We'll break?  Yes.  We'll break and more with all of us and little Gene.  Well, what we got on the way is Dirty Elvis.  Oh, well, I got a little dirty Elvis.  Dirty Elvis.  And it's real.  Yeah.  It's actually Elvis talking dirty.  More lost audio of Elvis.  Found some lost audio.  How the fuck did they find that after that long?  And you know how we're doing the Hoda and Kathie Lee thing?  Oh, what a great, great...  No, man. 
[01:22:30]  I'm telling you.  Yeah.  We figured out how to make their horrendous TV show better.  You play the beep game.  Oh, okay.  And you learn that they really like talking dirty.  Like, here's a quick one, but we got a longer one after the break.  Listen to this.  And you should know about Anthony, and I knew this right away.  Anthony's a f***er.  I am.  No, and I think most people miss out the f***ers.  And I'm with it.  He does not mess around.  Look.  That's a quick one.  He's a f***er.  You should be careful with that, though, because it sounds like she's saying something  dirty and people are misinterpreted.  Oh, yes. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah, you're right.  I have to go see Derek and make a promo.  I don't want to.  Oh, wow.  It's always a good time.  You don't want to make a promo or see Derek?  Both.  That lunatic.  He just sits in that room with his f***ing Timothy Hutton hairdo.  F***ing wishing he was still an Ordinary People.  Trying to save Buck on the side of a boat.  Stupid Buck.  F***ing open-toed shoes in f***ing January. 
[01:23:30]  Hope he loses a toe to a bike messenger.  Hope his toes get caught in, like, a f***ing...  The chain of a f***ing bike messenger's bicycle.  He loses two.  Derek just had to replace his iPhone because he smashed it.  Did he?  Oh, yeah, yeah, he did.  Because his computer had crashed on him, so he smashed his iPhone.  He probably smashed it because he was holding it to his ear in the floor, rushed up and hit him.  He's drunk. 
[01:24:00]  I got it.  Why did he break the phone?  Because his computer crashed.  Exactly.  I don't know.  No one knows.  No one can figure out the logic behind this.  His computer crashed, so he was mad about it and then threw his phone against the wall.  Because he knew he couldn't break the computer.  I don't know.  I would have broke the computer, I think.  So he broke the iPhone and had to get a new one?  He wailed it.  I've smashed a couple.  Yeah, I've got to be honest, I was guilty of smashing one myself.  I still got one, and that's f***ing I broke.  Yeah?  Sure.  Sure.  In L.A., I was in the f***ing London Hotel about two years ago, and I just smashed it on the bathroom floor. 
[01:24:30]  Because AT&T is such a terrible service.  I was so angry that I couldn't get reception.  No, it didn't.  I had to pay for it.  Oh, oh, I thought they paid for it.  And I had a message I really wanted to save, too.  I'm so mad.  Yeah.  But f***ing one of the guys from The Wire left me a message.  Oh, s***.  Lance Reddick, who he did have in.  But he had left me a voicemail.  Oh, God.  To this Lance Reddick. 
[01:25:00]  And I broke it.  Broke the phone.  You don't have it.  What's worse than feeling so incredibly stupid after you've broken something that you know...  Getting AIDS.  Yeah, you're right.  I punched my computer monitor screen once.  I punched the monitor on the laptop.  And it just made one of those...  It looked like a picture of a broken laptop screen.  Yeah, I know.  You know when you do that?  You got all that screen blood juicing out everywhere.  Weird colors and cracks. 
[01:25:30]  And then I had to hook it up to an external monitor and drag everything off of it.  It was just a pain in the ass.  I've done that, too.  And I've been like...  The second you do it, you're like, oh, good.  I had to punch my laptop screen closed once because it just kept locking up and I just  couldn't stand it anymore.  So I went to hit it closed, but it only kind of went halfway.  So just to finish the job, I just delivered a sweet right hook to the top of it.  Nice.  And it closed, but I reopened it because I knew it was maybe a little, perhaps too hard.  Yeah, a little problem.  Yeah, that screen was all shelled up. 
[01:26:00]  Green blood.  Yeah.  But same deal, then you got to hook it up to your TV and drag all your shit off of it.  Yeah, drag it off.  And shame, like, fuck, I shouldn't have done that.  There goes that file.  Fuck, I guess I got to go to Best Buy.  Yeah.  Let's take a break.  Yes, sir.  And Dirty Elvis next.  Oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[01:26:30]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[01:27:00]  Dirty Elvis show.  This is Dirty Elvis show.  I love having fingers that are symmetrical.  You had to bring it up. 
[01:27:30]  I was just sharing with you.  You had to bring it up, right?  That's it.  I think my little finger, what is this, the pinky, I guess?  I think I have a, well, I think I got another deformed finger.  I was just dealing with the fact that my thumbs are a little odd.  I got, I got, what's her name?  Megan Fox.  Megan Fox thumbs.  I got that same fucking thing.  Juna had those thumbs, too.  Who does?  The girl.  Juna, the pretty girl.  Yeah.  Oh, right, right, right.  That came in.  And now I'm thinking my pinky isn't high enough. 
[01:28:00]  Isn't it supposed to make the top knuckle?  Mine is.  Everyone look at their hand right now.  Mine just about makes the top knuckle on the ring finger.  Mine's way below it.  That, you know what?  I got two fucked up fingers now.  Believe me, I'd love you to have fucking fetal alcohol syndrome hands, but that's not that  bad.  This one is way, it should be like this high.  No, no, no.  Yes.  Look.  You make it.  I'm making the knuckle.  You make the knuckle?  Barely. 
[01:28:30]  This finger looks like it belongs on another hand.  Oh, shit.  I'm amazed I could grab anything at this point.  Is it on both hands?  Is it symmetrical?  No, this one doesn't seem as bad.  See?  Let me see.  They're not bad.  Let me see.  Put them together, like, right on each other.  No, they're fine.  They just...  No, that one is a little shorter.  It is shorter.  Aw.  The fuck was my mom doing when she was pregnant?  You're not symmetrical.  No.  At all.  Look at my thumb.  This thumb, I have to grow a nail a little higher to make it look like it's a real thumb. 
[01:29:00]  And is the other thumb like that?  Not as bad.  See?  Which, why is the one hand longer?  Maybe she slept on one side.  She slept on her left.  My left hand, it's taken all these years to pull you out.  The doctor pulled you out by your arm?  Yeah.  He just held his hand and pulled him.  Dude, my left hand is fucked up.  It's not that bad.  It's bad.  I mean, for a child.  And I wasn't going to bring it to the show, Jimmy.  Thanks.  Why not?  You have to now.  You should tweet pictures of it.  That's what everybody wants to see. 
[01:29:30]  Of course.  I want to see that.  Yes.  And look how tiny the pinky nail is.  Aw.  That is like a little baby pinky nail.  That's a baby fucking pinky nail.  It looks like the small toe on the end of a foot.  Which is not bad on your hand, wherever you can see it.  Okay.  Fuck, I need gloves.  You're all right.  No, I'm not.  Look, I'm covering it up on my sleeve.  I'm almost embarrassed about my nickname now.  What's your nickname?  They used to call me Nice Hands McGillicuddy.  Nice.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  A nice.  All right. 
[01:30:00]  Oh, E-Rock played the Who because.  He looks like Horton.  Because the Who released a worldwide health alert for SARS eight years ago today.  SARS was eight years ago.  SARS, really?  And we had to bring that up today for what reason?  Oh, no.  And can I bring something to the show?  E-Rock writes me yesterday.  And I know he's mad at me, so that's why I want to bring it to you guys.  Uh-oh.  I want you to be honest. 
[01:30:30]  Sure.  He writes last night, you watching the news.  Thank you.  Is it?  See, fuck you, E-Rock.  Because I know these guys will trash you easily, but, you know.  That is infuriating.  Thank you.  Do you get it now, E-Rock?  Two more seconds to go, are you watching this on the news?  And describe what it is.  Thank you.  But he wants you to get back to him.  He wants you to be the one to tell you the news. 
[01:31:00]  I'm so glad Travis had a natural reaction with that.  Because I'm like, it drives me nuts.  He does this all the time.  That is infuriating.  So I write another cryptic message from my friend Eric.  And then he gets mad.  He goes, he writes, how is it cryptic?  How is it cryptic?  Thank you.  Because then I felt like an asshole.  Holy shit.  Thank you.  Yeah, that's crazy.  He writes how.  It's right there.  That's selfish.  Let me see. 
[01:31:30]  How is it cryptic?  That is such a selfish thing to do.  You can't just say, you're watching the news.  I like that when someone goes, could you answer a question?  Right.  And then you're like, just write the question.  Or, guess what happened?  Oh, what?  Thank you.  You motherfucker.  Because then he makes me feel like an uptight asshole.  Like I was supposed to understand all this.  And I know I'm an uptight asshole at times.  Oh, no.  But I know on this one, I'm like, no, I'm not wrong. 
[01:32:00]  Because he does it all the time.  What do you think in Iraq when you do something like that?  What's the mindset?  So then he goes, another explosion happened in Japan.  Now sirens going off in Tokyo.  Yeah.  And then I wrote, you wrote, you watching the news.  That could be anything.  Right.  I'm like, why are you bothering me?  I'm playing with my child.  I'm going to need another child on the BBM.  Travis is right.  He goes, he's baiting you into a conversation. 
[01:32:30]  Are you baiting?  Like, if you just gave you.  I don't think he is, though.  That's what makes it even worse.  If he just gave you the information, you didn't even have to answer him back.  You could have just been like, wow, that's fucked up.  Right.  But if he goes, watching the news, now you've got to answer him.  Then he says something.  And now you feel like you have to then comment on what he told you.  He's baiting you into a conversation.  I'm trying to force friendships.  Yes.  Iraq, comment.  Iraq, comment.  No, that's accurate.  But you got mad at me. 
[01:33:00]  No, I didn't really.  And then you're like, how is it cryptic?  I'm like, how is it cryptic?  But even by that.  You said that you're watching the news.  Even by that, when you said it's cryptic, he didn't go, no, it's not.  He threw it with a question.  How is it cryptic?  Yeah.  That forces you to respond.  Now you have to then again respond.  I guess you're right.  Because look, there's a whole conversation that could have been just one stupid thing.  One thing.  Because they're on the TV, another explosion in Japan.  Every text you send should start with, please talk to me.  It's Eric.  Please talk to me.  That should be your away message. 
[01:33:30]  Please talk to me.  Hi, Eric, feeling needy.  Please acknowledge me.  Thank you, Travis, for the natural reaction.  Because I thought, and then I'm left to feel ridiculous that I attacked him.  Did you read this today?  I was actually going to turn and go, what?  I know.  It's just, you naturally do it.  All right, good.  I, I, all right, good, good, good, good.  Because I walked away from that like, I'm being an asshole again?  Really?  Because the guy goes, are you watching the news? 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  It could mean anything.  You watching the news?  That could be like, oh my God, are we in trouble?  Because watch.  Did someone say something?  Is there something happening in New York?  Is that, like, it could be anything.  I'll tell you what it means.  First thought was watching the news.  So you're, you're thinking news in general already.  Right.  So you've seen all the tsunami videos.  You know the earthquake was horrendous.  And you know the fucking nuclear power plant is horrible.  Yes.  So him saying watching the news means it has to be something way worse than that, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I'm thinking it has to be some other disaster somewhere else. 
[01:34:30]  Just infuriating.  All right, good.  Wow.  Let's get into some Dirty Elvis, everyone.  Oh, am I glad I dumped Apple yesterday?  Really?  What's going on?  Pre-market down $9.07.  You didn't have a lot of Apple shares, did you?  I had options.  Why'd you, oh.  They were April options, so I didn't want to fucking. 
[01:35:00]  It'll go up, though.  Oh, but it went up.  It went up yesterday pretty good.  So I dumped out.  Well, you heard about Steve Jobs.  What?  See?  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Should I now buy more call options, though?  It's down $9.  If you get a call, you might as well, I mean, at least hold them until it drops down at least  $10 below the Niki.  You know, you got to put it, but, I mean, how many puts in a bull market, it's probably 
[01:35:30]  not.  Oh, I hate the stock market.  But it's fun.  Put full push buck by.  Fuck you.  Profits share, revenue taxes, laws, percentage, blah, blah.  Fucking horrible.  I missed that character.  What was that character called?  Born Room Jimmy.  I only did him once.  Born Room Jimmy.  Yeah, yeah.  I loved Born Room Jimmy.  I did him a couple times.  That was on cunt radio when I couldn't use dirty words.  Yeah.  Naughty, naughty words. 
[01:36:00]  On horrible fucking CBS.  So this market's going to be bad, huh?  Yeah.  Let me go to my options.  Okay.  You just do a show.  I'm going to buy some more.  God.  I'm buying some April call options because I know this fucker's going back up.  2,000 bodies found on the shoreline in Japan.  2,000 fucking bodies.  Wow.  I'm still holding to 100,000 people, but that doesn't seem like it's going to be anymore,  huh?  No, I don't know where they're at.  I think they're up to 16,000, I think, is the latest. 
[01:36:30]  Wow, really?  So it's not going to be anywhere near 100, which is just a lot of people.  Yeah, it's horrible, but it could have been way, way worse.  Yeah.  Way the fuck worse.  I'm not tweeting my horrible fucking finger to people.  Why?  They're calling me a monster.  Yeah, you have to.  You should send out your hands.  I can't do that.  Oh, you should.  Really?  Look how tiny the nail is.  Oh, we'll send the little guy out.  Let him feel some love.  All right, what's this Dirty Elvis about there, Danny? 
[01:37:00]  I guess some footage had been found of Elvis in the back of a car or limo.  You can't really tell from the video, but he's in the back.  He's in a stage jumpsuit, so I guess he was going to a concert or whatever.  And they're talking, having a conversation about a launch that NASA had recently done.  And they caught Elvis on tape being a little naughty.  A little naughty.  Did the launch chair go off?  You can see it in the sky. 
[01:37:30]  I had a tomato sandwich.  It was disconnected up there.  Gigi and him saw the explosion.  I didn't know it.  I had launch.  Because it just launched right over here.  I had launch.  I was buried in a beaver.  Oh!  How was your launch?  Is the Elvis channel going to do eight hours on this clip?  You ever listen to the Elvis channel? 
[01:38:00]  No.  Oh, my God.  Never.  Oh, my God.  So he buried the beaver or something, right?  Ugh.  Do you bury the beaver?  He was buried in the beaver.  Oh, he was buried in the beaver.  Okay, yeah.  You can't bury the beaver.  You can put something in the beaver.  You can just fucking.  Bury the beaver.  You can just fucking and fucking.  Oh, that sucks.  Sorry.  What happened?  I can't place fucking option orders pre-market.  Wasn't that great, you guys?  That stinks.  That was it, huh? 
[01:38:30]  Yes.  There's a video of it?  Yeah.  Who was taking that?  The colonel?  Stop trying to make it into something interesting.  That's radio genius just trying to make something.  It's like, where did it come from, this piece of tape?  Exactly.  It was a guy who would have it.  Who did his hair?  At least he has his sunglasses, Jim.  This was a riot before the justice.  Oh, God.  This is true.  I don't have my sunglasses.  I tried with the Elvis channel angle.  They take shit like that, and they'll do eight hours on it.  They'll have to call all the people that are in the limo and have an hour conversation 
[01:39:00]  with each person.  What were they thinking at the time when Elvis was talking to me?  You heard the one about him and Priscilla?  Is that all you're going to do the rest of the day?  No one's falling for it.  Are you watching the news?  And then I call him out on it, and he gets mad at me.  I'm an asshole.  So the Elvis thing's good.  It's terrific.  Oh, and I'm glad I added to it by adding nothing new. 
[01:39:30]  Like, you don't listen to the Elvis channel, obviously.  No.  It'll bother you.  Do it one day on the way home.  Why?  Because they just interview people that are like, weren't, they're sort of part of his  inner circle, and they're alive, so they remember the time he ate a BLT at a diner.  And they tell those stories?  And they'll talk about it for an hour.  It's the weirdest fucking channel ever, the Elvis channel. 
[01:40:00]  It's terrible.  It sounds awful.  You just look at your radio and go, who gives a shit?  Who gives a flying fuck?  Play in the ghetto again.  Something.  In the ghetto.  I'm no Steve from Bayshore.  Can we play Laughing Elvis?  Maybe that'll save this.  I like Laughing Elvis, man.  Who turned us on to this?  Steve from Bayshore?  That's an old clip, yeah.  I don't have to say that.  He's been dead since 77.  That's an old clip.  You might have thought it was late 90s. 
[01:40:30]  Why don't we play Laughing Elvis?  Yeah, I like that one.  To regroup a little bit.  That'll be good, because the other Elvis thing, not so good.  Why wasn't it good?  I don't know.  Talking about, you know.  We were expecting dirty, like really dirty, like him to be saying something like, fuck.  Yeah.  Priscilla's cunt.  Yeah, Priscilla's being a real cunt.  That's a great Elvis.  Yeah, I do a really good Elvis.  That is good.  I gotta call Priscilla.  I'm gonna take a big peanut butter banana sandwich.  I love doing bad Elvis impressions. 
[01:41:00]  It's so annoying.  All right, I'll add something to this that'll go nowhere.  Priscilla was on The View, or the other show that's trying to be The View.  You know what's Sharon Osbourne?  The Talk.  Oh, right.  What is it called?  The Talk.  The Talk. 
[01:41:30]  And she comes out.  Her face is literally frozen in time at this point.  Yeah.  And they're all like, oh my god, you look so beautiful.  She's so beautiful.  And they actually said something like, how do you do it?  Looks so beautiful all the time.  Well, I like that.  I just got a lot of Botox on my face.  The face didn't even move.  Can we see a picture of her, Dan?  Does she look good now?  Oh, no.  Oh, well, I want to say the whole way.  A big, fat snatch. 
[01:42:00]  He's been dead 34 years.  You're kidding.  How did it happen?  I was just listening to you.  I want to see what she looks like now.  How old is Priscilla?  She's got to be pushing 40.  Priscilla Ballew.  That's what I was trying to figure out.  We figure he's been dead 34 years, so she's probably 55.  She's not that old.  This show is horrendous, by the way. 
[01:42:30]  If you want to see another show that...  There she is.  Look at her frozen face.  Oh, it is frozen in time.  See?  It's like a mastodon in a glacier.  She doesn't look good.  She looks like Lisa Marie.  That's her in the bottom left?  Oh.  Yeah, I guess.  Now she's got that clothes.  Well, now there's a logo over her.  That's still fuck her.  I don't care if she's had some work done.  I'd still get it there.  Some work done?  Yeah.  Well, you'd do it just because Elvis had his dick in there.  Sure.  I'd do it while he had his dick in there.  Fuckin' liquor clit. 
[01:43:00]  You know it's got a smell.  Ew, yeah.  There's a lot of bulging.  Look at how fucked up her face looks, man.  All right.  Let me say hi to Sam.  Maybe we should move on from Elvis' stuff.  Sam in Colorado.  We will do Laughing Elvis going into break for the people, though.  Mm-hmm.  Elvis is singing a song, and a ball guy or a guy with a bad toupee in the front row or something just got Elvis laughing.  Sam, what do you got, buddy?  Hey, Jennifer Aniston's new video on Smart Water. 
[01:43:30]  She got the puppies in her lap, and they can't get her out of her crotch.  Yeah, I tweeted a still of that commercial to prove my fact because I am working on a documentary about Jennifer Aniston.  You're going to expose it?  Well, I'm convinced that she can't get a man and be married and all that because she has a smelly pussy.  Right.  And the Smart Water commercial certainly doesn't help deny those rumors.  Did you see this yet?  Yeah, with the puppies all attacking her snatch.  There's literally ten puppies attacking her snatch. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  And then the people are trying to get the puppies away from her snatch.  Jesus.  Like, get out of there.  You're going to get hurt.  Oh, thank you.  We're going to go back to Elvis because we didn't do enough on Elvis.  Tom on Long Island.  Hey, morning, boys.  Hey there, Tom.  What's up, Tom?  Hey, what's up?  Yo, I got to back you up, man.  You listen to the Elvis channel.  I have guys that work at gas stations.  Like, yeah, I remember one day I was pulled up, and I filled this tank.  I checked his air, and off he went.  Man, that was the greatest day of my life.  I swear.  Go right to the floor.  Are you kidding me? 
[01:44:30]  That's why everyone's got to check it out.  I wish I had examples, and I actually wish I had audio.  Maybe Sam or somebody down the hall could work on it for tomorrow.  It is unbelievable how it's who gives a shit radio.  Yeah, no shit.  And then the host, it has to be the jolly, like, oh, well, thanks for sharing.  That's a great memory of Elvis.  Let's play in the ghetto.  Good song, right?  Yeah, because most of the people there are, like, dead, man.  Yeah.  So it's all these, like, peripheral people that sort of had an experience with Elvis. 
[01:45:00]  It sounds awful.  It's not good.  I mean, the music's good, but.  And what are they, I don't know.  I guess Elvis had a lot of songs.  Dedicate a whole channel to him.  What the fuck?  Yeah.  Some people really like that shit.  One or two Elvis songs I like.  If they ever came on, I'd listen.  Other than that.  Which ones?  I don't know.  I kind of like the one.  In the ghetto? 
[01:45:30]  No, I'm not a big in the ghetto.  Oh, come on.  Suspicious Minds is a great song.  I like Suspicious Minds.  That's a good song.  That's a good song.  That's a good song.  Suspicious Minds.  That's a good one.  That's a good one.  Third reactor explodes, and the fourth one is now leaking uranium.  Is that bad?  I would think a uranium leak is probably bad.  They can't just get emergency power there?  No.  Why?  And now it's past the point of, look, this shit exploding.  What are you going to power?  It blew up. 
[01:46:00]  All the shit that has to be powered is blown up.  Like, how do you get a pump in there now?  And now there's so much radiation there, it's not even good to go there.  Now they're saying just stay inside.  Just try to fix it.  There's, um...  Guess what?  They can't stay inside.  Their homes are in the ocean.  So now what?  Stay inside.  Stay inside what?  My home is at the bottom of the fucking...  Right.  At the bottom of the ocean.  There's, uh...  I guess level seven is the highest level of radioactive disaster in a reactor.  Why not ten?  Reactor. 
[01:46:30]  Before you give the second part of this, why not ten?  Make it easy for everybody?  Because then you hear...  But this one goes to seven.  Yeah, but then you hear five, six...  I know what you're going to say.  Then you go, oh, that's not bad, because everything goes to ten.  I guess because they didn't want to spread it out into those little pieces.  It's like...  They wanted to keep it into parsecs as opposed to point tens.  If you go to ten, then you've got to have ten levels of fucked up-edness.  This is only seven, so the chunks are bigger.  So it doesn't sound as bad. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  Because that's what I hear.  Oh, this isn't that bad.  Well, they're at a six right now.  Six out of seven.  Six out of seven right now, which is...  Which is, it's considered real bad.  And then seven is catastrophic.  What does that mean?  That's meltdown.  That's full meltdown with a plume of radioactive...  That's Chernobyl shit?  Shit.  Isn't Tokyo close to there?  Everything in Japan is close, because Japan's pretty small.  Yeah, how many of our states is Japan?  How big is Japan as opposed to... 
[01:47:30]  I like how we have to compare it to our states.  It's hard to figure out, because of the shape.  Is it California?  There you go.  It kind of has a crooked California look to it.  A little crooked California thing to it.  Look it in the mirror.  If you flipped California around, maybe.  Right, right, right, right, right.  It's now rated a six or seven worse than Three Mile Island?  Yeah, they're saying worse than Three Mile, but not as bad as Chernobyl last I heard.  But wow.  I don't know if that's changing.  But it's still, you know...  Can they cool them at this point in, or no? 
[01:48:00]  They're trying with, like, seawater.  Seawater.  But it's no good?  It's not.  They can't even get near it now.  There's so much radioactivity, and things keep blowing up.  Like, the containment buildings keep fucking exploding.  Does that fuck up the seawater?  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  It irradiates the fucking seawater.  There's nothing they could do about that.  You either got to cool it down, or you can't.  I said it yesterday.  Why are we poisoning our own air and water constantly?  Because we need power.  We need some power.  There has to be...  Montana. 
[01:48:30]  That's how big it is?  Japan is closest in size to Montana.  It's hard to plan for a tsunami, but if you're an island, Japan knows it can happen.  Like, you're not going to get a tsunami in Idaho.  Yeah.  But in Japan, it's possible.  How do they fucking not have enough backup to cover something like that?  You know what I would propose?  Because you build a platform in the ocean, and you have the reactor out there, and the  second something fucks up, you pull a lever, and the whole thing just sinks to the bottom  of the ocean. 
[01:49:00]  And just make believe it's...  And it's fucking cooling down.  That's it.  It's cooling down.  It's fucking gone.  But you know what?  Oh, my God.  As much as we're all thinking that Ant really is a cunt and an asshole, that's not a bad idea.  They would actually keep it cool.  It would fuck the water up around there, but that's what they're doing anyway.  The water's right there, so you can get the filter of the water in somehow with pumps  that you don't need.  When it cools down completely, does that stop radiation from emitting?  No, no.  It's still considered what they call hot. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, all right.  But not...  Yeah.  God, how many of the reactors are fucked up right now?  Like six?  All of them.  Four.  Four.  Four on that one facility.  And that wasn't a tsunami thing.  That was the earthquake that caused all that, right?  No, that was a tsunami, I think.  That was a tsunami.  The earthquake shut it down.  Knocked out the power.  Yeah, the earthquake shut the reactor down, and then the tsunami fucked up the power and  the pumps.  Oh, okay.  I wonder if we're going to start getting some West Coast radioactivity levels rising up 
[01:50:00]  a little bit, because that shit blows right this way.  Do you think it will get here or no?  I bet they do start seeing some, like, minor raised levels of radiation on the West Coast.  They have to.  Toxic Avenger, you thinking?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That stinks.  Got to go back?  What?  Got to go back.  What?  Where are you going to go?  Radioactive mess.  We're as far as east as you can go.  Where are you going to head to?  Maine?  I know where there's an old silver and turquoise mine in the Mojave Desert. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, let's go there.  That's where I'm going.  You already know where you're going.  I'm going to ground.  I hate turquoise.  I have a good plan.  I have a plan of action.  It'd take a while to get to Mojave, but...  You think my pinky has something to do with radioactive shit in the air?  Well, was Shoreham cranking when we were growing up?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, it was.  Did they ever turn that fucking thing on?  I don't think so.  I don't think so, either.  That thing was literally down the beach from my grandma's beach house.  No nukes!  We watched that thing being built from scratch. 
[01:51:00]  They fucked up the entire beach to build that thing.  Yeah, and then it never got turned on.  They had to make the beach wider.  Oh, no, they didn't have to make the beach wider, but all the shit, all the sand, they  had to dig out for the pipes and whatever the fuck they had.  They pushed up on the beach, making it the shittiest beach on Long Island now.  It used to be a beautiful beach, and now it's all rocks to the point you can't even walk  the beach without shoes.  They tried to put a nuclear power plant on Long Island, which is hilarious.  What the fuck?  There's no way off of Long Island except to drive through the city. 
[01:51:30]  That's it.  Unless you've got a boat.  Right.  So it got to the point where people were like, no, we can't have this thing here.  Well, no one listened to them.  Yeah.  They built it, and then...  I don't think they ever turned it on, for whatever reason.  They did some testing, and then it was just decided...  Complete waste of money.  This ain't going to work.  And it fucked up the beach, man.  Look at all that shit fucking launched in the air.  That was one of the biggest explosions yet. 
[01:52:00]  Is that a new explosion?  That last one.  Yeah.  That's the last one that happened.  Oh.  Oh, God.  Look at this guy's in one of those radiation suits.  Why don't we just turn off the TV and make believe this isn't happening?  You want to do that?  That's kind of fun.  Well.  Well, there are still 50 guys working in the plant trying to cool it.  Yeah, good luck to those.  Those guys are dead, man.  Good luck to those fellas.  Knows why they're on that point scale for the reactor.  Do you want to know why they only go up to seven?  Sure.  Let's hear.  All right.  Let's get some info today from Randy in Iowa. 
[01:52:30]  Sir, why is the nuclear disaster scale only up to seven?  Well, it's a fucking metric system.  Is that it?  I don't fucking know.  Sounds good.  It's like a royale with cheese.  We were counting on you, Randy.  I knew, by the way.  You did?  I knew he had nothing.  By the way.  Get out of here, Randy.  I just want to show you the level of preparedness of this show.  Yeah.  We just went to that guy as a possible nuclear expert. 
[01:53:00]  Ah, shit.  Yeah.  We think too highly of ourselves, huh, Gene?  Yeah.  I guess you're right.  You think too much of me, kid.  I guess you're right.  I'm the hunted one.  I guess you're right.  A turk.  I have to go, guys.  Oh, no, you don't.  No, you don't, Jimmy.  And hopefully I won't be killed in this plane crash.  No.  Plane crash.  Because I'm flying in small planes once I'm there.  What size?  Is it a propeller?  No, no props.  But I got to go to DC-9.  Is it an umbrella? 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  Wait, wait.  DC-9?  Yeah.  Is that bad?  Oh.  You don't like the DC-9?  Wait, they're fucking hard.  Probably, as I put them on the same level as the MD-80.  MD-80s I would feel better about.  Yeah.  What's the DC-?  Yeah, maybe a little.  What's the problem with the DC-9?  It's a life-hander.  Oh.  Yeah, DC-9s are just-  I've never spent this flight.  They're so old.  Is it a Buddy Holly type situation?  No, it's a Delta flight, but I don't like Delta.  It says Delta on the side.  That's good.  There it is.  Let me see.  I do not want to get on this fucking plane. 
[01:54:00]  How old is that plane?  It's like a 727 without the fucking third engine in the middle.  DC-9s are fucking old, man.  Yeah, they are very old.  What do you got to do DC-9 from where to where?  From Newark to Atlanta.  Ooh.  Newark to Atlanta.  Fucking Delta on their old fucking planes.  You're going to be out of your mind on this flight, aren't you?  Fucking assholes.  It just annoys me.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, that's-  Oh, boy.  Frickety old shit plane.  Oh, gosh.  Oh, God.  Oh, Jimmy.  And there's crash footage right there.  Oh, God. 
[01:54:30]  A DC-9.  Dude, they went down a lot, I believe.  Oh, boy.  I'm sure they fixed the problems in this economy.  Ah, dude.  They're terrible.  With such a great economy, I'm sure everything's fine.  Oh, look at that one falling.  Oh, no.  Don't show them that.  Oh, my God.  Look at the upside-down DC-9.  Don't show Jimmy this.  Holy shit.  Oh, no.  That's-  Oh, God.  Look at all the crash.  Danny just punched up a shitload of crash pictures of DC-9s.  Oh, my God.  And there's-  Believe me, there's plenty of them. 
[01:55:00]  There's pages of them, Jimmy.  Hey, Jimmy, you all right?  I still can't fuck my sunglasses.  Oh, God.  Bye, guys.  That's a terrible shot.  Are you trying to tell me a plane shouldn't be upside down like that?  No.  Never.  Just turn that picture sideways.  It's fine.  Oh, Jimmy.  You'll be okay.  This may be my last appearance on the show.  No, no, no.  You moms?  They fly every day.  No, don't say it.  Look, you see?  He just did.  Look, it's climbing.  It's climbing.  Danny turns it around.  Now it's there.  Look at that, baby. 
[01:55:30]  Bam.  It's climbing out.  Look.  Yeah, I'm flying safely.  See, you're fine now, Jimmy.  Look.  Holy fuck.  You gotta love the flippy, flippy pictures.  Why is the sun coming from the ground?  I know.  I don't get it.  Holy fuckballs.  And why is the fucking rate of climb really steep?  Oh, gosh.  All right, guys.  You'll be fine.  I'll see you again.  Hello, baby.  I hope I don't go bop it all over the mountains. 
[01:56:00]  Here's one where they glued the plane back together after the crash.  It's an accordion plane.  They put the whole thing back together for you, Jimmy.  See?  All right.  I don't want to go.  No, good Scott speed, Jimmy.  You'll be fine.  Are you going to forget your coat?  You're so nervous?  No, I want Kenny to bring that to Boston.  Oh, okay.  What seat you got, Jim?  What's that?  Yeah, we're looking at the inside of the plane.  Oh, God, the inside is burnt and wrecked.  Oh, shit.  Oh, goodbye, Jimmy.  We'll see you when you get back.  We'll see you in the next life.  No, we'll see you when he gets back.  Right. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, that's terrible.  They're from the 80s, DC-9s?  I thought they were in before that.  Really?  Yeah, that's a fucking old plane.  That looks like an old plane.  And you know what it is?  They've been bought and sold so many times by different airlines and retrofitted with shit  and just upgrades.  Blades.  Nothing worse when you get on an old plane.  I know we've done this bit a bunch, but...  You see the fucking ashtrays are still there and the armrests?  And the razor blade dispensers.  Yeah, dispenser.  There's a fucking...  Yeah, there's like a box cutter pickup point where you're able to just pick up your box 
[01:57:00]  cutters as you walk in because they weren't dangerous back then.  And they allowed smoking for so long you could still smell the old cigarette smoke.  Yeah, the interior is yellow from the tar and nicotine on the walls because people smoked  on those planes.  Nothing more frightening than that.  Nothing better for equipment too, I bet, than just getting caked up with GAC from a million  cigarettes being smoked in there at some point.  Fuck that.  DC9, that poor bastard. 
[01:57:30]  If you have any questions about Japan, this guy can answer.  Thomas in Japan.  Oh, really?  Thomas.  Yes.  Yes, hello.  Hi, you're in Japan?  Yeah, I'm in Nagoya.  Nothing's happening.  All right.  Wait, wait, wait.  Prove you're in Japan.  What time?  What time is it?  What time is it?  What time is it?  What time is it quick?  It's about 9.29 in the evening.  P.M.  9.29 P.M.  Yes.  That's too many hours. 
[01:58:00]  Someone says wrong.  Someone says correct.  Someone says checks out.  9.30, 12 hours.  Yep, it is.  Hold on, where are you?  Must be true.  Hold on, where are you right now?  In your house?  I'm laying in bed in my apartment.  Turn on the fucking TV right now.  I want to hear some of that Japanese talk.  Okay, here you go.  Because that would be tough to quickly get on a computer, right?  Yeah.  They're speaking English.  I'll turn to another channel. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah, but you can hear the Japanese in their voices.  Yeah, I can hear it.  I heard it.  I'm good at that stuff.  They're showing pictures of the nuclear power plant, the different areas you can go to.  Well, I would assume they are.  How far are you from the power plant?  About, I told my brother, from Salt Lake to Las Vegas, about 300, 400 miles. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, okay.  So you're okay over there?  Yeah, nobody can truly happen down here.  That's really weird.  So is life just going on like normal where you are?  Yeah.  See, isn't that weird?  It is weird.  Like there's a part of Japan that is in complete turmoil.  Well, if you watch TV, you're just convinced this is Japan.  The entire island, right?  Yeah.  But it's not.  You get that weird perspective like everything is completely shut down.  Yeah.  Japan is fucked.  But the reality is the rest of Japan is going about their lives. 
[01:59:30]  It's fine.  Yeah.  So why are you on the phone?  I mean, it's cool to take a phone call from Japan, certainly.  Yeah.  But help us out.  What kind of info can you give us?  Yeah.  What do you got?  What do you got going on here?  I mean, why am I on the phone?  Any questions?  I listen to you all the time.  I appreciate it.  Thanks.  What brought you to Japan?  A plane, probably, I would think.  A DC-9?  Or a boat.  That old gag. 
[02:00:00]  No, I teach at an international school.  Oh, you do?  There's good money in that.  Yeah.  Really good money to be a teacher and go somewhere else.  Yes.  Very good money in that.  You teach the English?  No, I teach fourth grade.  You're not teaching English?  Fourth grade, really?  We teach in English, but there's sort of a hierarchy.  There's the English teachers.  Right.  And there's real teachers.  Oh, real teachers. 
[02:00:30]  You don't like the English teachers?  What do you think?  They're stupid?  Okay.  They just have a degree.  I hope the name doesn't get up there.  I'm going to be beat up in the streets.  But, yeah.  How great would it be to teach fourth grade?  What's that?  How great would it be?  Is that good?  It must be like how Einstein walked around this world.  Just being so goddamn smart in front of a lot of people.  True.  You know what I mean?  You could just be a genius.  You would be a genius in that classroom every day. 
[02:01:00]  Because you're so knowledgeable.  You could do stupid things.  Right.  I don't know, Tom.  We don't have a question for you.  Do you have a question for the...  I have nothing to ask this gentleman.  I do feel sad about Jimmy's glasses and let him know that I am praying for him.  Praying.  Oh, for his flight.  Oh, Jimmy's flight.  To find his glasses again.  Yeah.  Hopefully he'll find his glasses and land safely in Atlanta in a few hours.  So I want to track his flight now. 
[02:01:30]  I know he's leaving around 10.30 on a DC-9 to Atlanta.  That's scary.  Let's all track Jimmy's flight on Twitter today.  I just want to say thank you guys.  You're really doing a...  You're doing actually a good job with the Japanese.  I appreciate it.  I listened to you the last couple days.  Oh, yeah?  We're doing good?  What do you mean?  Yeah, I think so.  Oh, you're treating it with respect.  And you're given just the right amount of humor in there.  But what did we actually say... 
[02:02:00]  Contra-spect.  That makes you think that we're, you know, doing the right thing as far as Japan goes?  Yeah, we're really bastards.  Oh.  Yeah, of course.  Let's do some Laughing Elvis, everyone.  Let's hit that and we'll continue.  Are you lonesome tonight? 
[02:02:30]  Do you miss me tonight?  Are you sorry we drifted apart?  Does your memory stray to a brighter summer day  When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?  I do the chairs in your boiler 
[02:03:00]  Seem empty and bare  Do you gaze at your bald head  And wish you had hair  And you're filled with pain  Shall I come back?  Tell me, dear  Are you lonesome?  Oh, Lord, Lord 
[02:03:30]  I wonder...  You know, someone said  The world's a stage  You need to play a part  I can't...  I can't...  I can't...  Oh, God...  Oh, man, I'll tell you... 
[02:04:00]  And I had no cause to die  Sing it, baby  Shall I come back again? 
[02:04:30]  Tell me, dear  Are you lonesome tonight?  Is your heart filled with pain?  Shall I come back again?  Tell me, dear  Are you lonesome tonight?  Sirius 197 XM 202 
[02:05:00]  The Virus  This is the Opie and Anthony Show  For Jimmy!  Make me cry  Oh, no, that's not...  You know it's a light  Falls  That'll be the day  When I die  When you keep me  All you love  And you're  You're hurting  Oh, my God!  Ah! 
[02:05:30]  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Oh, that's terrible  Say goodbye  Yes, that'll be the day  When you make me cry  You say you're gonna leave  You know it's a light  Cause  That'll be the day  When I die  Oh...  God forbid!  And that was considered, what,  the devil's music back then? 
[02:06:00]  Oh, yeah.  Really?  This is rock and roll.  This is...  This was...  Fuck the establishment.  Yeah.  Yeah, DC-9s.  You should have known this.  Yeah.  The original version of the MD-80  And the MD-88  Excuse me.  They were built in the 50s and 60s?  Ooh.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's...  DC-9 manufactured in 1965 
[02:06:30]  Also coming in.  Scary that they're 46 years old  And still operational.  That is scary, man.  Yeah, that is really funny.  But what do they do?  They change out a lot of parts, obviously.  Yeah, but, you know,  how much can you do that?  How much can you rip shit apart  and put it back together  with new shit in it?  And, you know,  it's like having an old car,  an old classic car  that you put new shit in.  You ever do that  and then all of a sudden  you smell something burning  and a wire is shorting out  cause you put a new stereo system in 
[02:07:00]  and shit like that?  Eventually it just all falls apart.  Yeah, yeah.  It's ticking  and you don't know what the fuck.  So why are they still in operation?  Cost, yeah.  It's one of those...  So they would rather risk a crash?  I would think sometimes  the risk of a crash  is cheaper than...  Oh, boy.  They're just kind of like...  But I thought they cared  about the individual.  I don't think they really do.  I thought they cared about people.  I don't think they care.  No?  I don't think they care at all.  They do the numbers?  Yeah, they do the numbers.  Like...  Ed Norton did?  Yeah. 
[02:07:30]  Fight Club?  And if the numbers, you know, figure,  they don't do the fucking...  The adjustments, right?  Yeah.  That's crazy.  But I'm sure it's true.  It was a great scene that was.  It really was.  I gotta see that movie again.  It's been a while.  I know.  It's a good one.  CNN is using this hot Latino  like weather girl now, man.  Her?  She looks a little thick.  She's...  Well, I mean,  the one we had yesterday  that we saw  with the belly shirt  in the really tight jeans.  She looks weird. 
[02:08:00]  I don't find her  at the least bit attractive.  She's not bad.  No.  No.  I'm not filling it, yo.  I'm not filling it.  And we got a pilot on the phone.  We got Pete in Arizona.  Pete?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Good.  So, you want to know  why the DC-9's still in operation?  Yes.  Well, you got Cessnas  and you got all kinds of Pipers  and all that  that were built in the 60s  and the 50s  that are still in operation. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah, but those are little planes.  Yeah, but even the big planes,  all they do is  they got the avionics  and they upgrade the avionics  every couple of years.  Yeah.  So, as long as the avionics  are up to grade,  the FAA will allow you to fly.  Hmm.  Aha.  If it's the power plant itself  or the mainframe,  it's just the avionics.  Oh, great.  So, it could be  the same shitty engines  and the same shitty cables  running the fucking control surfaces.  I'm sure there hasn't been  any rats nibbling  on those over the years.  Oh, no. 
[02:09:00]  The wires fraying  in the fucking overhead.  Wonderful.  Oh, pretty much.  If you look at most planes today,  the average plane flying  on commercial flights,  the bare minimum  is what's maintained  and that's what's  FAA regulation.  Oh.  Fucking just...  That's why I was a pilot  in the military, too.  And that's why I,  personally,  I don't like to fly.  Oh.  You don't like to fly  because you understand  what's going on. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  Most planes, I mean,  go through a lot of shit  when they're flying  that the people  in the back  don't even know.  Yeah.  Like what?  Oh, there's all kinds  of times  when you're flying  a plane  where you'll actually  have glitches  in the avionics.  A glitch.  You just fly through it.  You have to fly old school.  Seed to your pants.  Use the old  iron compass.  What's that? 
[02:10:00]  I'm flying  looking at train tracks.  Seriously?  No shit.  Oh, fuck.  The old iron compass.  I recognize that real way.  Oh, that's fucked up.  Yeah, it's fucking...  All right, Pete.  I don't want to know anymore  so we're going to get ready.  Seed to your pants.  The thing...  I know the two  aren't connected but...  That's funny.  When you're on a flight  and they have to tell you  they can't play the movie  because the VCR is fucked up  and they usually say VCR by the way.  Yeah, yeah.  Because they have decided  they don't really need  to have that shit. 
[02:10:30]  I'm thinking  what the fuck else  is wrong with this plane?  And I know  every time we bring this up  pilots and people go  you're assholes  it's two separate things  but you wonder.  I always think  when the VCR doesn't work  and yes,  I will too say VCR  because you hear that  more than...  You hear the tape  clunking in.  Right.  I think...  You know why  it's not working?  Because two wires  are touching together  and sparking  and are about to catch  the entire...  Oh, okay.  In between the ceiling  and the fucking fuselage skin  on fire. 
[02:11:00]  Which means  the two are connected.  Right.  In the end.  Exactly.  If it's on the plane  it's connected.  Yes.  Fuck that.  I think we wanted Sam in here  because he had more  on the E-Rock thing.  Sam!  But E-Rock's not around so...  Weird...  Oh, we were making jokes  during the commercials  because everybody asked  where's E-Rock  and they said he's cutting  some stuff up  meaning for the 10 o'clock hour  and someone had to say  what, ham?  He's carving.  He's carving some stuff up.  You went ham?  I was going roast beef.  You were going to go roast beef?  Well, we were right 
[02:11:30]  on the same page.  Yeah, it's enough fat  in both of them.  Why think of something  he could be cutting up  that's for breakfast  because we all know.  Oh, yeah.  No, no.  Or something healthy  like maybe some turkey  or something.  If you could eat like E-Rock  why not go right  for the roast beef  at 9 in the morning?  Just go for it.  It must be so nice  to just say fuck it.  To give up  and just say  you know what?  Fuck it.  I'm going to have  those cookies.  I'm having that fucking  like ham  and roast beef  and  cake. 
[02:12:00]  Don't you feel like shit  though when you do  the fuck it for a while?  Yes!  Because we all do  the fuck it.  We all do the fuck it.  You have to just live.  Then I start feeling  like shit  and that's what  brings me back.  You're like  you know  why did I do that?  Like an old bitch.  You just sit there  going ah  why did I do that?  They don't like  when we talk like this  because then we see  like girls and stuff.  Well, fuck you.  They get really mad  when we talk  like girls and stuff.  We do that shit  so when we were  photographed  and put on Twitter  and everything else  you don't have to hear  oh you got AIDS  or oh you fat fuck. 
[02:12:30]  They're going to do that  no matter what you do.  I know.  I can't win.  I went through a phase  where I was like  really fucking skinny  and then  now I'm not  you know.  I'm working out  eating and stuff like that  and  someone looked at  one of the videos  I put up  and went  Ant you're getting fat.  It's like  really fat?  Really?  Am I fat?  You know where's near fat?  Fucking cock.  E-Rock's fat.  Yeah right.  I'm sorry.  Roland.  That's fat.  E-Rock. 
[02:13:00]  That's fat.  Roland's trying to do  something about it though.  Is he?  Is he?  What?  Last I saw  he was  there he is.  Roland are you  trying to do  something or not?  Last I saw  he was shoving  that pudding  in his face.  He's trying to  get a record I think.  Hey let's set  the record first.  Hey what's going on  with Big A?  I saw Weird Medicine  what are we supposed  to retweet something?  What were we supposed  to do?  I read that  maybe Weird Medicine  there.  Dr. Steve could  fucking  tell me what I'm  supposed to do.  What are you doing?  Not eating as much. 
[02:13:30]  Oh okay.  That'll do it I guess.  He's juicing.  Are you juicing?  Yeah and smaller  porches.  Smaller porches.  That's all you gotta do.  And less sides  I always get.  Yeah yeah the sides  are so delicious.  Nice sauce.  Can I go back  to the DC-9?  Of course.  And I want  confirmation of this.  Very famous  plane crash  happened with  the DC-9.  DC-9.  Don't look down.  I'm not.  Your friends  are gonna help you.  About what year? 
[02:14:00]  Nah.  No?  Very famous  plane crash  DC-9.  I want confirmation  though.  I don't know.  Not the  not the  you could ask  the golfer.  Not um  you could ask  some questions  but don't ask  the year  because that  will definitely  give it away.  Alright.  Um  actor?  No.  Musician?  Yes.  Oh right.  Leonard Skinner.  There you go.  Yeah.  That's what they're  saying.  Is that true?  It probably is.  Really?  Yeah.  Really?  Why would you do  that?  Why would you get  that lousy plane? 
[02:14:30]  I hear a lot of  people visit that  field.  Really?  Come a place to  go check out  shit.  People are stupid.  You wouldn't do  that?  No.  I'm one of those  guys.  I would do that.  I don't want to  do that.  That's kind of  morbid and almost  like who cares.  It's very  interesting though.  But it's like a  who cares kind of  thing too.  Like oh I'm  standing here.  Let me see.  You've done the  Kennedy thing right?  No I never went  down to Dallas.  That is really cool.  Never been to  Dallas.  That shit is cool.  Yeah that would  be.  Alright that's  something I would 
[02:15:00]  check out because  everything's still  there.  You know it's like  the buildings and  shit.  You go to a field  it's just still a  fucking field.  But yeah that I  would check out.  You don't have a  morbid curiosity?  No morbid things.  Remember the  Grey Line tour in  LA?  Yeah yeah yeah.  Where all the  famous dead people  dead people they'd  show you like where  they died and shit.  I love that shit.  It's very very  cool.  I guess the most  morbid thing I did  and it wasn't  because of the  haunted thing it  was because of the  actual murders was  Amityville Horror 
[02:15:30]  House.  That's cool to  check out right?  Because the guy  like killed  fucking his  family in there.  And then I  don't understand  the people.  Someone finally  bought that house  and got rid of  the windows that  makes it all  fucking creepy.  Yeah the classic  windows.  Why would you do  that?  Don't buy that  house.  I would buy that  house because it's  the Amityville Horror  House and I would  keep it exactly the  I was very  disappointed.  They changed the  whole look of the  house so first of  all so the cars  don't slow right  yeah yeah slow  down in front of  the house.  They actually  changed the address 
[02:16:00]  too I believe.  There's so many  houses you could  buy.  You live down  there right?  Actually it's not  too far from my  place.  It's really not  the Amityville Horror  House is not very  far from my house.  It's pretty close.  I'd never been over  there and around  Halloween time I was  like you know what  fuck it let me go  over there and take  a look at it.  I was very  unimpressed.  A you can't tell  it's the house  B in the movie  they make it seem  like there's like  all this property  around it.  It's just it's just  another Long Island  house with another  one right next to  it.  I know.  It's not creepy or  eerie. 
[02:16:30]  It's just a house.  It's just some  shitty house.  It's not shitty but  it's a you know it's  just it's a neighborhood  they changed that barn  roof look with the  little quarter windows  that was the  trademark of that.  The windows look like  eyes.  Look like eyes right  yeah.  When I was in high  school we would get  some road sodas.  We called them road  sodas.  Hold on let me.  Let's get some road  sodas.  Man.  Hey who's picking up  the road sodas.  Road sodas.  That's awful.  Isn't that horrible. 
[02:17:00]  And then we would go  like after we had a few  road sodas in a parking  lot somewhere we go  hey let's go check out  the Amityville Horror  House and drive to the  South Shore.  Yeah.  And then it took you  like an hour just to  find the fucking thing.  Yeah you gotta find it.  But in the middle of  the night it's kind of  it was it used to be  kind of a little creepy  to do.  Yeah.  But the windows were  the very important part.  You'd see it and be  like that's the house  man.  So some asshole buys  it and then changes the  whole look.  Yeah.  Because you would buy  that house and go  fuck yeah I want to  I'll make my house an  attraction for everybody  I don't care. 
[02:17:30]  That's it now?  Or is that it like then?  Wait is that what it  looks like?  That's it now on Google?  Is that from the  Googly?  What is it called?  Is there a canal behind  it or something right?  Yeah.  112 Ocean.  Oh wait I don't  remember there being so  much front yard or is  that deceiving?  I don't remember  looking like that.  No that's it's deceiving  that's not that big a  yard at all.  Yeah it's not.  It's it's.  And look at the front  it's just like.  Which windows were  changed now?  I don't remember any  of this anymore.  Zoom in.  Yeah cause that used 
[02:18:00]  to be uh.  Yeah.  That used to be like  those barn style.  Yeah.  Oh right.  So they just put square  windows.  Oh okay.  Yeah yeah.  Yeah you faggots.  Would you still like go  in there and sleep?  Absolutely.  Yeah.  I didn't think the movie  was that scary.  I know.  It was.  The movie sucked as a  matter of fact.  I would be kind of  creeped out.  It would be kind of  creepy.  Old houses creep me out  in general.  I went to that hotel in  fucking Colorado once and  I couldn't sleep the whole  fucking night.  Alright let me ask you  something about that.  So you go into an old  hotel or an old house 
[02:18:30]  you definitely get  creeped out or get a  feeling right?  Yeah.  I don't think I have  any special powers but  most of us get a  creeped out feeling.  What is that based on?  Do you think it's an  actual energy that we  don't understand yet or  do you think it's because  it's old?  I think it's your own  fear.  It's your own fear and  unfamiliarity.  But why don't you get  that in a newer house?  Because it's  I guess you're not  thinking about the  history as much. 
[02:19:00]  I know when I was  sleeping in old houses  as a kid too it was  kind of creepy because  the keyholes were those  literal keyholes and the  big crystal-y doorknob  clubs and shit.  But what is it based on?  And the room kind of  had a smell of that it  wasn't new.  Does it make you feel  like oh boy dead people  did live here?  Yeah yeah like people  that have lived here  are dead and you know.  I would love to know  what that's based on.  I mean you're  explaining it a little  bit I guess.  It was lived in.  Like the house had 
[02:19:30]  been lived in.  But you could go in a  house that's 20 years  old.  Yeah.  It depends.  Sometimes you do get  the creeps in a 20-year-old  house too.  So then maybe it is an  energy.  I think it's more  motif.  I think it's more you go  in there and if it's it  looks old and it's not  revamped and painted and  shit.  The carpet's worn where  people were walking.  So why I think weird shit  just because it was old?  I don't know.  Because you think about  the people in history of  the house. 
[02:20:00]  Like my house no one  ever lived in it.  Why didn't you sleep  when you were in  Colorado?  Because it was a  haunted hotel.  They sold it as that.  Like you went in and it  was almost like the  Overlook Hotel.  And it was Western  style and they had a  pamphlet at the desk and  you would read it and it  would tell you stories  about certain rooms and  hallways where a woman  you'll see a woman  crying looking for her  child that died. 
[02:20:30]  And I'm just like I  don't need to fucking  read this.  But the thing is.  Why did you go there  then?  Because we were a little  fucking like drunk and  it seemed fun and it  seemed fun to read it  when it was still light  out and shit.  And it's like oh fuck  look there's go.  And then the second it  gets dark I'm thinking  about this shit going  why did I read that?  Yeah because now you're  scared out of your mind.  Because now I'm in the  room.  I don't care how old you  are.  Some of that shit will  scare you.  And I thought I was  thinking if something  happens if I see  something I'm going to 
[02:21:00]  die.  like I would fucking  just lose my shit.  And I don't know why  like if I literally saw  a ghost I would be  like ah it would scare  the shit out of me.  You ever get in a  situation like that  where you are like  kind of laying in the  bed and you refuse to  open your eyes because  you don't know what  you're going to say.  Or look at a corner  too long a dark  corner.  It's fucking still a  baby.  I know.  It's like I'm a grown  man.  I like this.  This guy goes oh and  hair queers.  We must.  You know what we must  be.  What the fuck. 
[02:21:30]  Come on.  What the fuck.  We must be.  Ghosts.  Really.  I'm a grown man and  I'll play that game  with my eyes like  don't open your eyes.  You don't know what  you're going to say.  Yes.  What is that.  Jay Jones or  something like that.  Look at old paneling  and see faces.  When you look at old  paneling and you see  like these morbid  twisted the scream  faces.  Yes.  Yes.  That's very scary.  What is that based 
[02:22:00]  on.  Or you see like a  chair in the corner  with a pillow the  wrong way and you  have to get up and  move it because you  can't stop looking at  it.  Right.  It looks like someone's  sitting in the chair or  Iraq.  You ever been like  maybe in your house  been in the basement  and it sounds like  somebody's walking  upstairs right above  the room that you're  in in the basement.  No.  Used to happen in my  first house.  What was that.  We don't know.  But I remember being a  little kid.  Was there an  apartment upstairs  dummy.  No.  It's a small house  in Brentwood and 
[02:22:30]  and this we'd be  downstairs in the  finished basement  watching TV and if  you turn the TV off  it sounds like  somebody's running in  the hallway going to  the bedrooms in the  room above you.  That's kind of creepy.  Look man I have a  brother he's convinced  that the house he  lived in in Westchester  was sold to what was  haunted.  Oh.  Like toilets would  flush in the middle  of the night.  How is that possible.  Explain that one to  me.  Yeah that.  Some plumber.  Well if if I would  think if the flapper in  the tank was faulty 
[02:23:00]  right and water was  able to get under  there.  Wouldn't it just run  all night.  Well it would kind of  sometimes it would run  but if water was able to  get under there and lift  the flap up it would  flush.  Like a faulty seal  between the the  flapper and the the  actual.  I'm gonna I'm gonna  call him maybe today  but because he had a  lot of shit that went  on in that house.  Yeah.  I'm I'm now convinced  there's go see you  know and he wasn't one  of those guys.  Goose.  So who knows who the  fuck.  By the way of course  we're wrong with the  Leonard Skinner info. 
[02:23:30]  Of course.  It wasn't.  Of course.  It was wrong with that  one too.  What was it.  A lot of people saying  it was a Convair Convair  Convair 240.  Do you know that one.  Never heard of it.  Well you know this shit  don't you.  Yeah.  I know a lot about  planes but I know I  don't know that one.  Oh that kind of does  look what wow.  A CV 240.  Does that make sense.  That's old.  Well it does kind of  look like the plane.  It was a propeller  plane.  Yeah.  I don't think it was a  jet right.  Oh really. 
[02:24:00]  Makes sense.  That looks like an old  DC 8.  With the propellers.  Fuck that.  Yeah.  The Marshall football  team died in a DC 9.  That was a terrific  movie.  Did you watch that?  Yeah.  I couldn't be bothered.  It was a Convair 240.  At least that's  according to the  Wikipedia.  A DC 3. 
[02:24:30]  Worked in a building  that is haunted.  Fucked with the ghost.  Freaked him out.  All right.  Let's.  Haunted.  Do you believe in ghosts?  I absolutely do.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I have a good story  for you actually.  Let's go.  All right.  Give it a try.  We'll be the judge.  Bridgewater Sports  Arena in New Jersey.  I have a ton of ghost  stories but this is the  most recent one and this  place is built on an  Indian burial ground  supposedly.  Everyone that works  there.  How many Indians were  there?  I'm going to pause for a  second.  How many Indians were  there to be buried  everywhere?  Why does it always have 
[02:25:00]  to be an Indian burial  ground?  It's with the Indians.  Yeah.  There were other people  that were buried.  Right.  Why are they so special?  Yes.  I've got no idea.  Anyway I'm in the  pro shop and I'm there  all alone and it's  late at night and all  of a sudden I looked  down at the end of this  back hallway and it's  kind of blurry a little  bit like the air like  he coming off a cave  middle almost.  Oh.  And then I walked  down there and I was  there anyway here and  it's kind of like I got  a real uncomfortable  feeling and I said  all right fine use my  energy like those ghost  shows or whatever and 
[02:25:30]  move something.  I want to see you do  something.  And I think you're a  pansy.  I shit you not.  A replacement blade that  was sitting on the ledge  flew right the fuck off  and just slammed on the  ground and I ran outside  and chain smoked for about  20 minutes.  Wow.  Holy shit they listen to  you huh?  Just from you watching  some ghost shit on TV.  That's scary.  Come on.  I can't deal with that  shit.  Come on.  Come on.  Freak me out guys.  All right guys.  Punch it out.  I need stuff I could  shoot at if it gets 
[02:26:00]  scary.  You can't shoot  ghosts.  No you can't.  Ghosts.  Ghosts.  Ghosts.  But you can shoot.  Well that's different.  Of course that's quite  a different scenario.  That's a different  scenario misused.  Isn't that a form of  a ghost?  All right.  Hoda and Kathy  Liam.  We got another beep.  Yes. 
[02:26:30]  What a great show  this is.  Hoda and Kathy Lee  fill in Anthony  Mackey from Hurt  Locker and they're  way out of line for  a morning show is  what Sam writes.  Really?  Yeah.  They had to fucking  clean this up.  So could air.  Censor how to get  involved.  Really?  Should we just play  it for you?  Yeah.  All right.  Hoda and Kathy Lee.  Worst TV show on TV.  He does not mess  around.  Look here's Anthony  out.  No that's Al  in me.  I don't think so. 
[02:27:00]  No.  Look at you.  Okay that's kind of  me fucking Sarah.  But look look look  watch this.  No give me more.  See?  See?  Now it's getting a  little weird.  See what I mean?  But there are some  people out there and  there's one woman in  particular who thinks  that fucking is  overrated.  She doesn't like the  idea of when you go  to someone's house you  and then when you're  about to leave the  house you  I think it's the  typo.  I think if it's two  guys you can definitely  have too much  I think you know  but sometimes you  just want to show  your appreciation  and your affection. 
[02:27:30]  You know like when  I'm you it's because  I just appreciate  you so much.  I like that.  Plus you give  you give great  great great  So it was much  more enjoyable.  Yeah.  Much more enjoyable  that way.  That's fantastic.  You want to talk to  a funeral director?  Why?  Is it haunted?  Is this something  about ghosts?  Yeah let's put them  on for a little bit.  I'm frightened.  I still don't know  what happened with  my funeral home story. 
[02:28:00]  I told you when my  dad's wake you know  you had to be there  for three straight  days so I started  wandering around to  see who else was in  the joint.  Oh no you don't do that.  And they were setting  up for a grandma funeral.  She had her pearls on  her hair done  her makeup done  open casket.  I was the only person  in the room I swear to you.  I have told this story.  Did you fuck her?  And I fucked her.  Fucked her good.  Walking in the front  of the room I'm going  to check out this dead  body no one's around.  And I swear to you  the lights went off 
[02:28:30]  when I went in the  front of the room.  So I don't know if  someone's walking by  and said I'm going to  fuck with this person.  Did you shit your pants?  Yes I fucking shit  my pants.  I was like what?  Because now you're  in a dark room  with a dead person.  Well it was like  off and on.  They flickered?  It was more of that.  They went off  and then on.  Holy shit.  So I'm like alright.  And then I turn around  quickly and then I  quickly got out of the  room to see alright  who did that.  To this day I don't know.  So someone could have  easily just fucked with me 
[02:29:00]  and decide never to tell me  that was that.  So that's so creepy.  Yeah.  I swear to you that  happened.  Right when I was at  the front looking at her.  Literally right there.  Right there.  That's too creepy.  Yeah but it could have  been just someone  fucking with me.  That's the problem  with these stories  I guess is why I'm  bringing it up.  People could be  fucking with you  and never tell you.  So then you go  through your life  thinking there's ghosts  now or some shit  going on.  Right, right.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  But still.  It was really fucking  freaky. 
[02:29:30]  That would freak me out.  Joe on Long Island.  Joe.  How do you doing?  How are you doing guys?  Funeral director.  Uh yes.  Orbit.  Look I never believed  in ghosts.  I never believed  in any of that shit.  I never really did.  I've been in the  funeral industry  for about eight,  nine years.  Now we built  a brand new funeral  home where there  was nothing here.  Was there an  Indian burial ground?  Indian burial ground.  Always an Indian burial ground.  Ah you can't get away  from those engines.  These fucking stories  start with that.  No.  There should be  a restaurant  back like in the 50s 
[02:30:00]  so less people  got killed in the 50s  that means nothing.  But when I tell you  I always look for ghosts.  I watch ghost adventures  go through all that  and I'll forget the day  I walked into work  it was early in the morning  there was no one  in the building  I heard someone  say hello  and let me tell you  I almost  it was no no no  but I'm telling you  there was literally  no one in there  I walked in the door  and it was someone  that said hello  other experiences  when I'm in the prep room  at night  I'm going to go  wait wait wait  thank you Anthony  let's slow down 
[02:30:30]  what goes on  in the prep room  well the embalming  you know  preparation of the body  do you really hang  the body  so they drain  no you don't do that  you put them in that  do you put them  on that metal table  with the little neck thing  we have  we have an old  ceramic table  that's a ceramic table  and do you  do you use that little thing  it almost looks like  a bridge  when you're playing pool  and uh  and you put their head  on that  it's a head block  a head block 
[02:31:00]  you gotta chalk up  their head  with the head block  you gotta head block  what are some of the  other tools  in the prep room  oh there's  there's a bunch of tools  that we use  that big fucking  that big needle thing  that sucks the shit out  that's called  the troll car  yes  why do you have to  suck the shit out  to put the shit in  what shit  you gotta treat the viscer  to fucking  you gotta suck out  all the fucking fluid  and replace it  with fucking like  chemicals  I wanna go to the other side  with my fluids  leave my fluids alone 
[02:31:30]  they take your fluids  what if you need  your fluids  you don't  well they're people  they don't get embalmed  yeah but  yeah but why do you  even need to be  embalmed  because then you'd be  stinking and rotten  in front of your family  what tough shit  I want everything that  I want everything  to go with me  where does  where does the fluids go  yeah what do you do  you just put it down  the drain  uh well no  here in Suffolk County  we have to put it  it's called blood in a box  alright but let's be honest  blood in a box  you guys are all  trying to cut corners  the economy is bad 
[02:32:00]  even for the funeral guys  where are you dumping  the blood  no it gets put in a box  and we have a uh  a company coming  pick it up once a week  biohazard company  yep  and what do they do with it  I don't know  feed it to the pigs  oh god  oh my god  that's why the pork  tastes good  you put a solidifier in there  it makes it like a hard gel  and they pick it up  once a week  wait wait  you solidify it  into a hard gel  that's good  you have to  if there's powder  you put it in the bucket  it's like a five gallon bucket  and there's a powder  you put in there  and it solidifies it 
[02:32:30]  it makes it like a hard gel  who the fuck decided  that we need to do this  I never knew that  sloshing around  yeah but who decided  you have to take the fluids out  to put the fluids in  yay pudding  oh god  I think we found  our next contest  oh god  somebody gelatized  or whatever you would call it  yeah  blood in a box  that's nice  are you one of those  funeral directors  you don't actually  do anything with the bodies  you just kind of  throw them in the woods 
[02:33:00]  and let them pile up  until the authorities  snap the legs  because he doesn't fit  in the casket  right  that's what only happens  down there  sell the bones  sell the bones  to medical companies  and then just put pipes  in there  or pvc  that was a good one  the guy that was  fucking replacing  the bones with pipes  really  yeah  those are the guys  out in brooklyn  that said that  yeah huh  why would you  I understand  taking the bones out  why would you replace them  why wouldn't you put  like an afghan  over the body  so they don't know  there's no bones left  yeah I don't know  why you replace them 
[02:33:30]  with pipes  but  I don't either  like he's gonna get up  and start walking  they're calling it  vampire jello  the other black listener  vampire jello  vampire jello  that's good stuff  they replace your  with pvc  like if you're a long  bone donor  they replace everything  with pvc  it gives you structure  and everything  to make it look like  oh right  it holds everything up  still  so the legs don't  flatten out  and shit like that  so if you do  donate your bones  they pop pvc in there  yep  wow  you're just like  fucked at the end 
[02:34:00]  oh my god  I don't understand  why you have to do  all this shit  just to be buried  and what uh  never understood this  what happens with the organs  they stay in  for what  any normal case  or a long bone donor  normal case  normal case  everything stays in there  stays in  but you just pump  the fucking  embalming fluid  all around it  yep  and then we  and then we treat it  with that troco  you're talking about  that big needle  we treat it afterwards  with that  what do you do  with the bunghole  do you have to seal up  the bunghole  no dude 
[02:34:30]  they tell you in school  that you should put it  they call it an av plug  it's an anal and like  vagina plug  anal and vagina plug  that's called my cock  anybody  anybody who does that  is a sick fuck  oh really  oh that's sick  oh so you have  a whole box  of those plugs  that  unused  pristine  that box  got a lot of dust on it  he sells them to  Dr. Steve  to seal his wine with it  yeah  right  so uh  you're not  a big advocate 
[02:35:00]  of the anal vagina plug  no no I'm good on that  now why would  why would you  like  why would you have  to do that  if you do use  those plugs  they want to prevent  the body from leaking  from leaking  and it leaks  out of the ass  it could leak  from anywhere  but usually  sometimes  I mean it usually  doesn't but they  tell you to  I've never seen it  and if I see it  I'll take care of it  with plastics  or something  have you ever had  a coffin that's  just dripping fluids  during a week  no no  like an old Buick  in the garage  I love how this guy 
[02:35:30]  has to be  the perfect funeral  director  you know  some shit happens  oh you know it  you know it  oh no  I mean something  happened  I mean but  I mean  I don't know  what do you do  do you like  take care of things  artistically  and do you have  to cover up  bullet holes  and fucking  car accident wounds  and shit  yeah  so what do you use  like spackle  I use wax  use a lot of wax  wax  wax  or they  in school  they teach you  how to use  chicken wire  and like 
[02:36:00]  plaster of Paris  chicken wire  and plaster of Paris  what would you  use that for  you could  reconstruct a face  like that  with chicken  like say  their face  was caved  in or something  how about  you close  the coffin  yeah  yeah  some people  like it  closed  I mean  people  just use  wax  now  to do it  I mean  it's so much  easier  wax  it's so much  easier to use  I went to  an open  casket  recently  and it was  a young guy  it's rough  man  my great  great aunt  open casket 
[02:36:30]  whatever  but younger  people  open casket  that's rough  yeah  yeah  you don't  want to see  that  that's a rough  one  I don't know  why people  do that  oh god  it depends  on how  great the body  is  usually we  could pretty  much fix  anything  imagine  really  fix anything  I'll tell you  what it is  an open  casket  is a buzz  kill for  everybody else  in the room  it is  because you're  kind of like  socializing  and you're  catching up  like oh  there I am  it's in your  world  and you glance  over  too bad  are the  circumstances  but how's  the family  how's your job 
[02:37:00]  how's that  move to LA  and then you look  oh yeah  dead guy  in the front  of the room  great  fucks up  the mood  man  close the  coffin  so we  could socialize  close the lid  we'll assume  he's in there  exactly  put a nice  picture on top  yeah  but doing  the people  walk in  it's also  for closure  people walk  in  they get a little  emotional  beginning  and once  everybody  and the friends  start showing up  everybody  starts laughing  and you know  they don't have to  pay attention  to what's going  on in the front  of the room  anyway  how about  I want to  invent this  a slide door  window type 
[02:37:30]  thing  California  has that  they actually  do  what  that was  a complete  joke  like a  drive through  if you can't  make it in there  you can just  drive through  and have the  casket by the  window  and you can  do one of  those  are you talking  about  wait  wait  I think  I was talking  about  on the  casket  so if you  want to  see him  you can  shut it  and then  if someone  doesn't want  to  they don't  have to  open the  hatch  do a little  laughing action  alright  laughing like  jokes  you laugh  but it's not  the worst idea  in the world  no  that would  kind of  be 
[02:38:00]  especially  on the top  of the thing  there's the  little sliding  thing  you want to  see him  there you go  slide away  slide it open  why not  and the eyes  are open  looking at you  and then you  shut it  and you open  it back up  and the eyes  are closed  again  creepy  Indian burial  ground  or something  always Indian burial  imagine some woman  just walking around  going  I'm spending  eternity  with a  vagina  plug  take out  my  vagina  plug  like just 
[02:38:30]  walking around  help me  help remove  my vagina  plug  vagina  plug  that'd be so  scary  that would rock  oh god  this creepy  ghostly music  what movie  is this from  I have an anal  plug  remove my  anal plug  that's scary 
[02:39:00]  well guys look  unfortunately I gotta  go  I just pulled  off  they could wait  yeah where are they  going  where the fuck  are they going  you're in the only  business where people  could actually wait  take a break  really man  stop taking it so  seriously  really  what's wrong with you  did you even tell  your story  no I didn't even tell  it yet  we didn't know what  his story was  really fast Joe  I'm sorry  real fast your story  before you go  what happened was 
[02:39:30]  I was here late  one day  and I was  preparing the body  I was the only one  here  I had all the doors  locked  I'm in the prep  room  I'm just finishing up  and all of a sudden  inside the funeral  home by the prep  room  the door starts  banging  somebody was  banging on the  door  once again  I freaked out  I went to go  open the door  there was two  garbage cans  in the middle  of the hallway  and I'm like  what the fuck  I mean  this happens  all of a sudden  it's not going to be  a burial ground  why can't it just be 
[02:40:00]  a friend of yours  just completely  fuck with you  and never telling you  that would be good  and how would they  get in  all of those  locks  I guess it's a ghost  if I'm in the back  I lock all the doors  no one can walk in  and roll around  ghosts  I wish Jimmy was here  because I love his  ghosts  well that was spooky  yeah  alright get to work  alright Joe  thanks for  humoring us today  wax  I think all you guys  are ghoulish 
[02:40:30]  I know  there is just a morbid  thing getting into  that line of work  do you look at death  differently  do I yeah  you look at life  differently  you do  how profound  you never know  when it's going to happen  alright  it's like a box of chocolates  you don't think that's  in the back of every  single person's head  yeah  well a big clump of wax  too if you have  the back of your head  blown out  chicken wire  chicken wire  and plaster  it's a second grade  school project  I would be a shitty  funeral director  I sucked at the  chicken wire 
[02:41:00]  oh yeah  and what was it  the plaster of Paris  Paris shit  I sucked at that  alright Joe  thank you  why did Paris  get that whole thing on  huh  plaster of Paris  oh Paris  I don't know why  saw a ghost  went to school  with Kathy Lee  it's not her real name  who cares  doesn't believe in ghosts  famous DC-9  crashes  was in Iowa  Skinner's plane  used to be Zeppelins  yeah we knew that  right  oh right  alright we'll go to break 
[02:41:30]  with this  I investigate the paranormal  oh  yes  I am very afraid of ghosts  yes  I hate ghosts  yes  I hate ghosts  yes  I hate ghosts  yes  I hate ghosts  yes  I hate ghosts  yes  I hate ghosts  I hate ghosts  I hate ghosts  Those... 
[02:42:00]  Those...  Scare me tremendously, Robert.  Frunkus!  The virus.  Sirius.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to O.P. and Anthony.  O.P. and Anthony.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do. 
[02:42:30]  Right there.  We were all hoping that Elvive would have had a little more legs, Anthony.  Yeah, yeah, we really were hoping to ride that one.  And then, to hammer my point home, we'd have to go into a secret computer,  and we're not allowed to do that,  because you're really not allowed to make fun of other channels around here. 
[02:43:00]  That's a big no-no.  Why is that?  We're all supposed to be on one big team, one big happy family here.  What happened?  You could rah-rah the company,  but you can't make fun of other channels that you don't understand at Sirius XM?  Why not?  I don't get it.  I don't get that at all.  Because there's a few examples of the Elvis channel,  where you get fan experiences that one time Elvis almost looked at them,  and then they talk about it for an hour.  Yeah.  I want to hammer it home with an actual example, 
[02:43:30]  which would be really good radio.  But we can't make fun of other channels?  It's not making fun.  And then the people that would be able to get the audio for us,  we should not do that.  Aren't some people like...  Who cares where the entertainment comes from?  If it means beating down another channel around here, let's do it.  Let's do it.  Not every channel is great for everybody.  Maybe they'll cancel that one and go with you guys instead.  Yeah. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  I don't know.  So I guess we've got to just give up on the Elvis thing?  Yeah.  It had potential in it.  How was that?  Your nightmare.  That is my nightmare right there.  We're looking at a...  Well, in that picture, the blonde looks pretty hot.  And she's being carried around...  African-American gentleman.  Who is that?  Sam Jones.  Sam Jones, motherfucker. 
[02:44:30]  Smallville?  I don't know.  Yeah, I don't know Smallville at all.  Sam was running something down to the studio.  Selena Gomez was here yesterday.  God damn, is she hot.  Oh, she was?  Again?  Yeah.  And they had the TMZ guys right outside the building trying to get, what, another picture  of her?  That shit's it.  And why is Snooki wrestling?  Do you know what that's about?  Is she going to be part of WrestleMania?  Sam would probably know more than me, but I think TNA got Angelina or something. 
[02:45:00]  That's Sam's deal.  So then I guess the WWE answered back by just getting Snooki.  Am I sort of correct on that one?  Wait, but then I think I saw Snooki and Angelina in the ring at the same time, or the squared  circle, or the fucking cage, or whatever the fuck they call it.  Yeah, Danny's pretty much right now, because TNA has a character called Cookie, who looks  like Snooki, who's a wrestler.  That's who you saw.  They have a tag team.  It's Robbie E and Cookie.  No, the one I saw was Snooki, no?  You saw Snooki, but not with Angelina in the ring. 
[02:45:30]  What did I see then?  Angelina and Cookie.  No, I saw Snooki and Angelina.  No, no, not in the ring together.  You saw Cookie?  Who's Cookie?  Who's Cookie and who's Snooki?  Cookie is a wrestler modeled after Snooki.  Is she really short with the worst ass imaginable?  Well, you're thinking of Snooki in that context.  How are you short with the worst ass imaginable?  I know, it's horrible.  God must really hate you.  And then they announced last night that Snooki would be wrestling at WrestleMania this year. 
[02:46:00]  What?  Yeah.  Snooki's wrestling at WrestleMania against who?  Well, it's a six...  No, Cookie is in TNA.  That doesn't make any sense.  Why not move Cookie over so she can fight Snooki?  Because she works for a different company.  Because TNA brought in Angelina as their big get, and so the WWE said, face, we have Snooki.  The actual Angelina?  Yes.  So it's obvious.  Get Angelina and Snooki to fight at WrestleMania.  No, because TNA is not WrestleMania.  Well, give TNA a little money, because that would be something people would actually want. 
[02:46:30]  What do you mean give TNA a little money?  Why doesn't Snooki wrestle a fake Angelina?  No, you're all mixed up.  Angelina is wrestling a fake Snooki.  What teaming with a fake Snooki.  So then Snooki is going to have her wrestle a fake Angelina.  Why not?  Who's Cookie?  Cookie is a wrestler in TNA who's modeled after Snooki.  Which one is her right there?  That's Cookie and Robbie E.  So they had to audition dumpy short chicks to play Cookie.  I mean, I don't know if that was the...  She's horrible, this Cookie.  Wait, let me see another picture of her. 
[02:47:00]  I don't think you've seen her in the squared circle.  I don't know if...  I can't tell from that shot.  Why, the bulge was distracting?  The fuck?  It's Robbie E. and Cookie.  She looks better than Snooki.  And she sort of looks like JWoww.  No, but she's short.  She looks like a short version of JWoww.  That's supposed to be Snooki?  It's Cookie.  Why are they ripping the whole thing off?  Well, then WWE was just like, look, you guys are Bush League.  We're just going to trump all of you and just bring Snooki in.  Just the real Snooki. 
[02:47:30]  Do they have a Harley Keen, too?  Is he going to be going in and being wacky?  When did they bring in Snooki?  Last night, she was the guest star on Raw.  And they had to make believe she could actually beat up people?  Well, then she went in and took out Layla.  She can't take out anyone.  She took out Layla.  She jumped up in the air and pinned her down.  Well, probably true.  And she'll be in a six-person tag match at WrestleMania.  Oh, wow.  I can't wait for that.  I was trying to get the info up on TNA Wrestling, but I must have an old version of the website  or something.  I don't know what's happening.  Why do you think it's an old version of the website? 
[02:48:00]  I don't know.  I'm just trying to get to this new info, but it says that Sting is the world champ.  That's correct.  No, no, no.  That is correct.  Wow.  That's 20 years ago.  What do you mean?  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  He just wrestled Jeff.  I must have got the 1993 version of the website up.  Yeah, what happened?  Am I on the Wayback Machine?  He defended the title on Sunday at the pay-per-view.  Who did?  Sting.  But how old is he?  Sting retired a long time ago.  He's older than some of the other guys, sure.  Why do you still watch this?  How old are you?  I'm 27.  27 years old. 
[02:48:30]  Young.  Well, whatever.  It's old, my friend.  It just gets older.  Double J, Jeff Jarrett.  He's still around.  Yeah, it's Jeff Jarrett.  Angelina is in TNA.  Correct.  Is that McFoley's place?  Yes.  That's where we've got to, like, save McFoley.  Well, Taz is there, too, doing play-by-play.  But Taz doesn't have to wrestle anymore.  No, he doesn't.  McFoley does.  Why is McFoley wrestling?  He's got to do something.  And then, so they get Angelina, and Angelina's going to just fight who?  She is teaming with Cookie in a feud with the beautiful people. 
[02:49:00]  I've had it with you.  Well, you're asking me about TNA.  Well, this is a big story, because the news is showing.  Snooki is the big story, though.  You guys keep asking about Cookie.  Because I swear to you, and I'm not trying to do an Abbott and Costello thing here, I  looked up, and I saw Snooki and Angelina fighting.  No, they were not in a ring.  I swear to you.  Maybe on the Jersey Shore, but...  No, in a ring.  Snooki's never been in TNA, and Angelina's never been in WWE, so it couldn't happen. 
[02:49:30]  All right.  I'm really confused.  Maybe it was Cookie you saw.  Why doesn't Vince McMahon just get Angelina and fight Snooki at the fucking...  Because Angelina's yesterday's news.  Because everyone hates Angelina, so that would be something people would definitely check  out.  And it would get kind of real, too.  Because nobody...  Instead of that fake shit.  They need somebody to carry them through the match.  Like, if those two are wrestling each other, there's nobody to carry anyone through the  match.  Is there going to be an uh-oh moment where Snooki is in the ring by herself with some  monster, like, oh, God, how did this happen?  And she'll be like, oh, goodnight, uh-oh. 
[02:50:00]  Because it is mixed tag, so she could be in there with...  Do they call that an uh-oh moment?  With Dolph Ziggler.  They should.  Who the hell's that?  Dirk Diggler?  No, I said Dolph Ziggler.  Is he based on Dirk?  I guess his name is.  He's not a porn star, though, because they don't have porn stars.  Well, you're not allowed to have that, because they're going to keep it clean.  But what is it?  Former Intercontinental Champion, Dolph Ziggler.  Did he wrestle back in the 80s?  No, he did not.  Like everyone else in the fucking game.  No, you're thinking of TNA again.  Why can't they just have one champion?  Well, because there's two brands.  No, I mean in the same league, the Intercontinental Champion and then the World Champion. 
[02:50:30]  The Intercontinental thing is so dumb.  And then you have the United States Champion, I think they had at one point, even though  everyone that wrestles was from the United States.  Well, right now they got World Champion, WWE Champion, U.S. Champion, Intercontinental Champion.  I chomp win!  Wait, that's all in one league?  Yeah, but they're two brands.  Raw and SmackDown brands.  How can you be the World Champion and then there's a WWE Champion?  Because the World Champion wrestles on SmackDown, the WWE Champion wrestles on Raw.  But no one gives a fuck.  There's two different leagues.  Why did they do that?  Only Vince cared about that. 
[02:51:00]  No, because it's different guys.  But no one notices that when you do watch wrestling.  It's kind of like Honda and Acura.  It's all the same company.  But it's different.  It's not.  No one sees it as different.  One's a more luxury brand.  Right.  The Raw brand is more luxury.  A little more luxury.  And I guess SmackDown is for all the poor people.  SmackDown's on SyFy on Friday nights.  SmackDown is like zero down, sign and drive type of shit.  Yeah, that type of thing.  Who's that?  Sign and drive type of shit.  Who do you think it is?  That's fucking...  That's Zerk Diggler.  Dolph Ziggler.  Zerk Diggler.  Dolph Ziggler. 
[02:51:30]  We look like assholes, man.  He's actually good, Dolph Ziggler.  Really?  Yeah, he's good.  I'll pin you to the mat.  One, two, three.  I don't get it.  How much can you bench?  But Snooki's going to be involved in a mixed tag at WrestleMania.  Netflix up $5.69.  How the fuck did that happen?  Oh, boy.  I knew I should have bought that.  It's all those unemployed people in Japan.  They got nothing to watch.  They're like, fuck it.  Might as well catch up on the office. 
[02:52:00]  Rock and Stone Cold are going to be there, too.  Rock and Stone Cold?  And Undertaker.  Are they wrestling?  Undertaker is wrestling, but not Rock or Stone Cold.  Do you think I'll have to take a look at Rock and Stone Cold and go, like, what did you guys do?  Yeah, how did you do that?  That I still have to fucking be in this ring.  Well, Stone Cold is the referee in the match between Jerry the King Lawler and Michael Cole, the commentator.  So what year was that?  It didn't happen yet.  2011.  What year was that?  Jerry the King Lawler is wrestling. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah, Michael Cole.  No way.  Why is the King, because he's wrestling the evil play-by-play guy, Michael Cole.  They have now an evil play-by-play guy?  He's like a heel.  He always cheers for the Miz.  They have to have one of, they have to have an evil and good of every single thing.  This is the dumbest shit I've ever heard.  Do they have an evil ring girl?  No, no, no.  Of course not.  That's just silly.  Oh, yeah.  This is tops of the cable charts every week.  Exactly.  It's tops of the cable charts.  Still?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Last week, I mean, Monday night was a great episode of Raw. 
[02:53:00]  They're really ramping up for WrestleMania.  I love the road to WrestleMania.  It's the best time of the year.  The road to WrestleMania.  It's the best time of the year.  I wish you were wrapped around a pole on the road to WrestleMania.  I wish you were on a bus to a casino right now.  On the road to WrestleMania.  On the road to WrestleMania.  There's just a crash.  With your head cut off.  On the road to a highway side.  Oh, God.  I mean, it all starts at the Royal Ramos, cruise right through Elimination Chamber, and boom.  You're on to WrestleMania. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  Here's the Monday night numbers.  I think this is the Monday night numbers.  Unless this is wrong.  Oh, look at that.  Now I see them right on top.  Oh.  This might be old, actually.  Remember that guy, Tom, from Japan that called?  Yeah.  Is he radiation poison?  He's back.  Tom in Japan.  Yeah, sorry, guys.  We just had a Nshizuoka can in between Nagoya and Tokyo.  There was a six-point earthquake.  Happened about, inland about 50 miles. 
[02:54:00]  I just wanted to call up and let you guys know.  Did you feel it?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Really?  Anyway, I'm getting out of here before you hang up.  Don't be this time, okay?  No, no, no.  You got real shit now.  We just wanted to hear that.  That sounds pretty fucked up.  A six-point something just happened in Japan?  Yeah.  That used to be a big deal before you started hearing nines.  Yeah, nines.  Nines.  Yeah, it would have moved a little bit more, but yeah.  That's crazy.  All right, man.  You are correct, sir.  All right, thanks.  All right, Tom. 
[02:54:30]  Bye.  Japan is rocking and rolling, man.  Damn.  That's unbelievable.  Fucking heck, crazy.  All right.  I wonder if they got Raw over there.  I really thought it was Snooki and Angelina, which I was like, all right, that's kind of  cool they figured that shit out.  No, I get it.  I kind of get it now.  But Snooki and Angelina couldn't work a match at WrestleMania.  Why not?  Just have them pull each other's hair.  That's what we want to see anyway.  No, they don't know how to work.  I mean, because they don't know how to work.  You don't need to do all that wrestling shit.  You have two girls cat fight. 
[02:55:00]  That's all we ever want to see.  No, they can't do that.  What, they have to actually fucking have some skills?  Somebody's got to carry them through it.  That's why she's in a mixed tag and not, you know, just one-on-one with somebody.  Right, right, exactly.  That's what Dolph Ziggler and John Morrison are doing there.  Dirk Tiggler and Jim Morrison.  I know.  John Morrison and Dolph Ziggler.  Who cares?  Would you lick Snooki's ass?  Ugh, I guess.  She's a celebrity.  Just because she's a little...  What about Ernest Borgnine?  I guess.  She's a celebrity.  Yeah, he's a celebrity.  Would you lick her ass? 
[02:55:30]  No.  No, she's got an awful ass.  I'm sure it's rank, too.  Just rank.  Ugh, look at these ass pictures online.  Oh, fuck.  That's disgusting.  Ugh.  She's a slob.  Her ass is sideways or something.  She's a slob.  Your ass should never be pointing...  Yeah, look at it.  It's like if she took a shit, it would come out sideways.  It's like her cheeks, both of her ass cheeks are completely flat, and then like, kind of  make parentheses with your forefinger and thumb and put them together. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah.  Her rump at these.  And then that's the amount of actual ass that she has.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like this small little ass thing.  Surrounded by like valleys.  Then tilt it.  Her ass is 1030.  It really is.  Her ass looks like 1030.  Her ass is 1030.  Look at that.  You never want your ass to be 1030.  No.  You want some...  What time is it now?  You want some 6 o'clock ass, man.  Oh, look at that awfulness.  Dude, that's a fat woman's ass, but... 
[02:56:30]  That's horrible.  She's got the ass within the ass.  You see how the line runs out where the cheek meets the thigh?  Yeah.  It just kind of peters out like not even a quarter of the way in.  Yeah, it's barely there.  Usually that crease goes all the way up to the...  Yeah, that's supposed to run the entire length.  Oh, God.  What a hard ass she has.  Yeah, but that ass...  You'd open that up and that asshole in there would just...  You know it's a world of hurt.  She's just drinking booze every night.  Yeah.  Just sticky, sugary booze drinks. 
[02:57:00]  Big fucking black tar heroin shits she's taking.  It's just sticking to the side of the ball.  It's like resin.  Takes eight flushes to get the smear off the side of the toilet.  He's rubbing alcohol on the toilet brush.  To break it up.  That ass is on the road to WrestleMania, though.  Oh, well.  Of course.  On the road.  Let's play it would you rather.  Would you rather open up those ass cheeks?  Yeah.  Or open up the door to the nuclear power plant?  Oh, give me the nuke any day.  And open up that door.  I'll go in and try to cool down the core. 
[02:57:30]  Then look into the eye of the beast.  What if they say no suit?  No, I don't care.  I'm not touching Snooki's ass.  You don't want to put any fuel rods in there?  No fucking rods are going in Snooki's pile.  In her nuclear pile.  That's disgusting, man.  It's not good, man.  She's a wreck.  All right.  What do we got?  She's famous.  Give me a break.  Iris back on the Opie and Anthony show?  Well, remember Car Crash Comedy when we were, when that mongoloid was talking to Voss like 
[02:58:00]  they were going back and forth?  Oh, yeah.  Bobby Kelly?  Come on.  He's a nice guy.  Everybody knows him.  Jeez.  I don't think he meant Bob.  It was the fan who was there, Danny, of course.  And I interviewed him after Car Crash.  Yeah.  And Iris started walking up behind him.  Oh.  So I decided it was time to force Iris back on the Opie and Anthony show if we couldn't  have him.  Let's do it.  Let's get it back on.  Wow.  So we actually have an audio of Ira?  We have Ira on the show.  Yep.  Yeah.  Oh, that's kind of cool.  We haven't heard Ira in a while.  Yeah.  The fact is, Jay Thomas is a twat. 
[02:58:30]  We've had him on the show.  I want to hear Ira.  And we actually kind of got along, but he's a twat because he doesn't want to like, oh,  I know that guy.  What is he doing here?  I know that.  You all right?  Dude.  That's Bruce.  No, that's, that was there.  Oh, there you go.  Hey, Ixnay.  Ixnay.  It's actually family, too, man.  Right?  Yeah.  We got NYPD, man.  Yeah.  Fucking, all right, whatever.  Oh, it was good.  That's cool.  How did he get in?  Oh, shut him up?  All right, whatever. 
[02:59:00]  What are you?  What?  What's up?  You're saying things you shouldn't be saying?  No, no.  It's, um...  Let me see.  Go ahead.  He's writing.  I hope he's writing me a little note.  No, he's just...  He's, uh...  He's cute.  Let's see.  Uh, uh...  Uh, uh...  Uh, uh...  Uh, uh...  Uh, uh...  Just show me.  Oh, uh, uh...  You see it? 
[02:59:30]  Wait.  Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh...  Gotcha.  Okay.  Whatever.  Listeners have no idea what's going on.  I know.  I'm sorry.  It's secrets.  Shut up.  So, Jay Thomas is a twat because Ira started doing our show, and this is how this shit  works, by the way.  We have a bigger show than Jay Thomas, so we bring one of his guys on our show, we talk  about him, and he gives great radio to us, Ira, and then we're like, hey, this is the  guy from the Jay Thomas show, and it helps him out, too.  But for some reason, he had to be twatty about it and shut down the Ira appearances 
[03:00:00]  on our show.  He's reportedly very, quote-unquote, protective over Ira.  So were we.  That is factual as well.  We never took a shot at Ira, believe it or not.  And he always had Garrett escorting him.  Huh?  Garrett was always in here with him.  Yeah, making sure that we handled it properly, and of course, yeah, Garrett from our old  NEW show.  You might know him as Stinky, if you listen.  But Ira decided, nah, nah, yeah, I don't want...  And then he goes to management, and it became a whole thing behind the scenes.  I talked to Ira once outside, and he was all disappointed. 
[03:00:30]  He goes, I can't do the show anymore.  Not allowed.  So I got to listen to the people that say, don't go on your show.  Hello!  I missed Ira.  Yeah.  So you talked to him after Car Crash Comedy?  He was very nervous, but I forced him.  In the beginning is this, is the guy in the crowd.  You know, the guy who was insulting Voss.  In the crowd.  Mike, it seemed like you had a problem with Rich Voss in there. 
[03:01:00]  Do you feel like things got settled?  Uh, yeah, I mean, he's a comedian, and he does, he does knock people, but, I mean,  look at him, he really isn't in a position to knock anyone.  Now, he called you a mongoloid.  Do you think he was out of line?  Or accurate?  The honest question?  Um, I mean, it's a joke.  I mean, I can't really look too much into it or anything, but...  But are we thinking, like, more accurate, or...  It's up, it's up for, uh, interpretation.  But leaning one way or the other, we'd go accurate? 
[03:01:30]  I know you want me to say accurate.  Ira, did you enjoy car crash comedy?  Crash comedy, yes, I did.  And they said you wouldn't be back.  I'm not coming back.  You're back right now, baby.  No, I'm not.  You're right.  I don't want to be on, you'll be on Anthony's show.  Too bad.  Too bad.  Oh, no, no.  Too bad.  Too bad, Ira.  Oh, no, no.  Wow, they really got to Ira.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He's not allowed.  He said, I don't want to be on. 
[03:02:00]  Too bad.  Not, I'm not allowed.  He said, I don't want to be on.  But he wants to be.  He does.  I know he wants to be.  We've all talked to him.  He loved our show.  Too bad.  Mike's in front of your face now.  You're on now, Ira.  No, no, no, no.  I don't want to be on their show.  I can't.  I don't want to.  I don't like those guys.  It's not up to you, buddy.  You're on.  I don't enjoy their brand of comedy.  That's too bad, because he was great.  That is.  And it helped Jay. 
[03:02:30]  A lot of fun.  But he had a fucking, whatever.  He'd be a fucking asshole.  Ah, shit.  Of course.  Everyone has to be an asshole.  You guys are idiots.  Yeah.  Yeah, right.  Ah.  Ira would be good at WrestleMania.  Now, that's a good one.  Oh, enough with WrestleMania.  We're going to talk about something.  I want to talk about fucking Japan ruining my fucking finances. 
[03:03:00]  How bad is the Dow now?  Dow's 237 down.  Wow, it just opened.  NASDAQ's down 60.  NASDAQ drops to three months low.  Why can't people just go,  Well, things happen.  And then it goes back up.  Goodbye opportunity right now.  Oh, they got the Kramer on.  They got the serious Kramer on.  Is he yelling the N-word on stage?  It's the other Kramer.  Oh, I thought you meant the other Kramer.  Not Cosmo.  Look, he doesn't have any horns or nothing.  I guess it's really serious today. 
[03:03:30]  Yes.  He's not doing wacky things?  No, he's not.  Tech stocks among worst performers.  Worst performers.  Yeah.  Can you look up my thing?  Oh, oh, right, right.  Let me look up my thing.  Let's see what's going on with that thing right there.  I got some things.  I got some action.  Hold on, hold on.  Oh, you're down about 18 cents on the day.  On my thing?  Yeah, down to 8.  Am I still in the 8s?  8.72.  All right.  8.72. 
[03:04:00]  All right, I like that.  All right.  8.72.  They were doing an Ira impression contest, I heard.  Why couldn't I do that?  I like doing an Ira impression.  It's fun.  You should enter right now.  What's serious, Joe?  What was this problem with Ira?  Wow.  Who is?  Down a nickel.  What is?  Serious.  That's all right.  Is it?  So what is it at, 15 cents?  Should I buy some?  It's higher than that.  I don't know where it's at.  Should I buy some?  Jay?  Yeah, why?  He was afraid that we on this show would abuse Ira and take advantage of his feeble mind. 
[03:04:30]  How about the asshole talks to us instead of going to management and then maybe we could  have worked something out or maybe he could have given his point on the whole thing and  we go, all right, we understand.  But instead he went behind the scenes.  Yeah, he did.  And he wouldn't even come on the show at that time.  You asked him to come on and explain it.  Remember?  Yeah.  Remember?  Most of those guys never come on the show.  My God.  We should get Cookie on the show.  We were ripped off for the Ira thing.  Yeah.  That was too bad.  Would have liked to have had him back. 
[03:05:00]  He was always fun.  Talking about blowjobs.  I know.  Friends don't do that with friends.  Remember the blowjob?  Blowjob.  Didn't she call herself the blowjob queen?  Yeah.  I think she did.  She was a mess.  She was friends with Ira.  We didn't know what they were doing.  And she wrote a book on blowjobs.  Blowjobs?  Everything was just weird.  Read him on the bus.  Everything was really weird and creepy.  That's why it was great.  I know.  And then her daughter was pretty good looking.  I don't know what was going on there.  Well, you don't like those kind, but she was. 
[03:05:30]  Well, you know, it's not my cup of tea.  As far as those kind go, she was pretty hot, man.  Well, she was not my cup of coffee, actually.  But the blowjob queen was rough, man.  But she had a whole book on blowjobs.  Ira also did an impeccable Bobo impression.  Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo,  You're gay.  I think Bobo's gay.  That guy's a comedian. 
[03:06:00]  We'll win in the end.  We'll have Ira back.  Yeah, I wouldn't worry about it.  Probably just head down to Yonkers Raceway and grab him.  That's true.  Yeah.  I'm going to be just watching this whole Japanese situation when I get home.  Because I think in the next day or two, we are really going to see some shit.  Oh, no.  In what way?  I don't know.  Like some real meltdown stuff.  Like now they're hinting, oh, there could be a partial meltdown there. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah.  This is a bad situation, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  There's going to be another big world event, too.  Yeah.  It does.  No, there's going to be another really big one.  When?  Biggie.  I'm serious.  Biggie.  When?  I don't know.  Well.  I'm predicting the 22nd or 23rd.  This month?  Yeah, that wasn't a goof.  There's going to be another big event.  Ah.  Really big event.  Oh, really?  Shit. 
[03:07:00]  I can't stop.  Can we play Ira reading Twitters?  We can do whatever we want with our Ira audio.  That's right.  It's ours.  Yeah, but we can't have Ira.  No.  We can't have him anymore, but we can play the other shit until we get him back on our show.  Oh, some classic Ira?  Are we going to maybe do some of that?  Huh?  What is that?  Are you talking about 10 o'clock?  No, no.  We had a thing where Ira.  Are you on the air or in my ear?  Because I know I'm on the air.  He's on the air.  He would have said, hey, if he was just in your ear.  Hey.  I've got to record all the stuff he says. 
[03:07:30]  Right when I'm trying to listen to something Ant's telling me, and then all of a sudden,  blah, blah, blah, blah.  I know.  That's what it sounds like to you?  Yes.  I'm like, now I don't even know what Ant's fucking talking about.  Now people are going to say I'm not listening.  And he didn't even say anything important?  It's usually when it's obvious me and Ant are doing our thing.  Oh, so his timing is just all shit.  Hey, watch the news.  What?  Is that in your headphones?  Do you have something else on that?  You want to add to this, right? 
[03:08:00]  Yeah.  Jess was one time.  She got real pissed at Iraq.  Well, not frustrated like you are at his text because he was like, it was like a year  ago and he was throwing, I think he was throwing a surprise party for his chick and he was  being, he was doing his thing where he doesn't give you any details.  He just said, and he sent Jess a text that just said the date and the location.  Yeah.  And then Jess texts me and she goes, this is what Eric texted me.  What the fuck is this supposed to mean? 
[03:08:30]  Yeah.  There's so many.  It doesn't mean, it doesn't say what we're doing at this location, whether I'm supposed  to go.  You just nailed, there's, there's something in the circle that it, Iraq of course is the  son and we all evolve around him.  Yeah.  Revolve.  Revolve.  Revolve.  Revolve.  Revolve around him.  That fucking bombed horribly.  But what I wanted to say was that so many times people that know Iraq will go, what  the fuck does that mean?  Yeah.  He doesn't give you.  And you say it in that manner too, because he's so frustrating with his vagary. 
[03:09:00]  Because we're not all in his head.  He doesn't realize.  He's extremely vague a lot of the time.  Very vague.  He doesn't care.  He just shrugged his shoulder.  He's like, I don't give a fuck.  He's just like, whatever, dude.  Oh, God.  So this Japan.  Oh, and this earthquake, because the guy just mentioned a bunch of cities.  I don't, we don't know where the, I guess it's southwest of Tokyo.  What the fuck are those places?  Wasn't the earthquakes northeast of Tokyo, right? 
[03:09:30]  So this one was southwest.  Yeah, northeast.  Oh, really?  If I'm to believe.  I haven't seen anything on the news, so.  But that guy's kind of there, so.  Huh?  I haven't seen anything on the news, but that guy's kind of there.  Well, this woman right here looks very concerned.  So let's see.  Japan, new this morning.  Radiation levels at damaged plants spike, then subside.  Government.  I can't read that.  Why the slanty writing? 
[03:10:00]  Oh.  I don't, yeah.  That could be misconstrued.  Man, help me out, though.  Why do they have to have it like that, slanty?  I know.  It starts out really big on the left and then gets small as you go to the right.  Why do you need that?  To make it look three-dimensional.  See, they like the 3D look.  Yeah.  You don't even need glasses.  No.  It's amazing.  It is quite amazing.  It's incredible.  And they don't have the.  Hold on.  Let me go to this guy.  I follow this guy.  He's ahead of the info. 
[03:10:30]  There it is.  No tsunami alert from the two big jolts in Japan in the last hour.  So this idiot that's just a Twitter guy is way ahead of CNN.  They don't have this yet.  Nope.  And everyone's asking for this guy.  Once again, it's W7VOA.  This guy's getting his info way before anyone else.  Andy Levy, and it's Andy Levy on Twitter, is a great guy to follow for news in general.  And he turned everyone on to this guy who's W7VOA. 
[03:11:00]  He gets this shit way before anyone else.  I'm telling you.  W7VOA.  Fujinama Machi is how the name of the epicenter location is pronounced for the M6.2, they're  calling it now.  Fujinama Machi, what?  And CNN doesn't have this yet.  If Shizuka comes away with no damage from a Shindo 6 plus, that'll be amazing.  So this is bad for that area.  This guy is all over and CNN still doesn't have it. 
[03:11:30]  All we need now to complete the picture is for a Mount Fuji to erupt, he writes.  No tsunami alert from the two big jolts in Japan in the last hour or so.  There you go.  CNN will have this in another half hour.  That's how ahead this guy is.  Yeah, if you go to earthquake.usgs.gov.  Yeah, the chart.  If you see red dots, those are quakes that happened in the last hour.  Damn.  Wow.  That big red one?  And it's southwest.  So it's kind of just surrounding Tokyo.  It's just fucking with Tokyo. 
[03:12:00]  Oh, man.  That's a big...  What the hell is going on over there?  Holy shit.  And you would know this.  Yeah.  Do they kind of build Tokyo in an area they knew didn't have as many earthquakes?  No.  Tokyo is fucking old.  I don't think they even knew about earthquakes when fucking Tokyo was being built.  All right.  Although Tokyo was pretty decimated in the war.  Right.  And rebuilt.  Right, right.  So, eh.  I don't think it has much to do.  There's earthquakes all over that area.  When does this shit calm down for that area? 
[03:12:30]  It's cray-cray.  What's that?  When does this shit calm down and go back to life?  No, I'm serious.  Japan could just fucking, like, crack in eight pieces.  Who the hell knows anymore?  Well, why do we have the world's third largest economy over there?  Why are we trusting them with the number three spot?  Well, we tried to bomb them out of fucking, you know, out of existence years ago.  And now they're our pals, and we've got to deal with it.  Yeah, well, they are our pals.  Second only to Britain, I... 
[03:13:00]  Yes, yes.  I know that one.  Yeah.  I do know a little bit about some stuff.  W7VOA, if you're really into what's going on in Japan, and getting, like, much quicker info than CNN.  Hmm.  The stupid broad that had a fucking curling iron in her hair before she went on TV.  Ah, looking good.  She's got to look camera ready.  Why?  This shit is getting fucked up. 
[03:13:30]  Push her out of the chair and get that guy.  I'm telling you, get the guy.  You know the guy?  Yeah.  The guy you can trust.  Fucking five o'clock shadow.  The guy you can trust.  His tie is skew.  Make him look like he just came from a hurricane.  That's what I want.  That's the guy I want my news from.  That's disheveled.  A bit disheveled.  We need someone disheveled.  You think Wendy Williams is covering this?  No.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:14:00]  I mean, no.  No.  I want someone ornery, like Jack Cafferty.  Yeah, he is a nasty man.  He's an ornery guy.  Jack Cafferty.  Where does he lean politically?  Do you know?  He's kind of all over the place.  He is, right?  I've seen him take a right side and a left side.  I'm happy for him, though.  Because he was one of those guys that are trying to be down the middle.  He was a local guy forever.  And then he got the big promotion to CNN.  It was Jack Cafferty and Sue Simmons.  That's right.  He was a no-nonsense guy.  That's the type of guy, though. 
[03:14:30]  I'm telling you.  He's a curmudgeon is what he is.  A curmudgeon.  True.  All right.  I guess we made it to 10, but barely today.  He had a strong out, I think.  We cramped up right when we saw the finish line.  Our leg cramp.  Oh, boy.  I felt a leg cramp.  We got fucked by Suicide Hill today.  No, you had that good iris stuff.  I mean, that Snooki Cookie bit is going to go down in history.  Yeah, I don't think you're ever going to hear that again.  Maybe not.  No, fuck that.  10 o'clock hour, are we going to be hearing that? 
[03:15:00]  It's all Snooki Cookies.  Oh, you're still in here, I notice.  Yeah, I haven't been here the whole time.  Of course.  What's going on in the 10 o'clock hour today?  We will be going into Poe's Law a little bit and helping to bring some people into maybe  some of the references that were being put out.  We didn't play the clip of Snoop from The Wire yesterday, so we'll play that.  We'll get a little more information on the E-Rock texting situation, find out if his feelings 
[03:15:30]  are hurt, and all kinds of great stuff.  Sounds good.  Yeah, it's going to be fantastic.  I didn't hear you.  Let me say hi to Chris in Chicago.  Chris.  Hey, Chris.  Talking in your ear?  Because this guy's got a cool app I want.  Go ahead, Chris.  Yeah, Quake Watch.  Thanks for you, A-K-E.  Watch.  Do you got Quake Watch on your iPhone app?  No.  Now, you realize when you check out any of this stuff on the internet or through an app,  you realize that earthquakes are happening all the time all over the fucking world. 
[03:16:00]  Now, this is the question I got for you on Quake Watch app.  The Quake Watch app.  Does it tell you how big the earthquakes are?  Because then that would be cool.  Yeah, no.  It gives you all the data on it.  It gives you how big they are, where they're located in proximity to you.  It's got all sorts of crazy stuff.  And it's got tsunami warnings.  It's really cool.
