<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Jim Norton as a guest in studio.  The conversation started with a recap of a previous show featuring comedian Gallagher, focusing on Gallagher's angry reaction to Patrice O'Neal's critique of his act and Opie's accusation of racism against Gallagher.  This led to offensive jokes about Gallagher and speculation on the success of his subsequent shows.  Norton then recounted a terrible air travel experience involving a loud passenger, which segued into a discussion of recent airplane incidents and airport security changes since 9/11, including a video of a man bypassing security to kiss his girlfriend and a guitar-playing serenader at Newark Airport.  The show then shifted to a discussion of NFL playoff games, specifically the Dallas Cowboys' win, the Arizona Cardinals' high-scoring game against the Green Bay Packers, the Jets' prospects, and Chad Ochocinco's new truck.  They debated watching games at the stadium versus at home, criticizing sportscasters Bob Costas and Keith Olbermann. The segment concluded with an analysis of the Jay Leno/Conan O'Brien situation at NBC, including Norton's experience on Leno's show, followed by the "Breakfast Birthdays" segment.

The broadcast continued with an in-depth analysis of the NBC late-night lineup controversy, focusing on Conan O'Brien's demeanor and speculation on scheduling changes. This led to a discussion about Senator Harry Reid's comments on Barack Obama's race and dialect, sparking a debate on racial sensitivity and political correctness, featuring a lengthy, offensive call with "Coop."  A tangential discussion about curling emerged, followed by a caller mentioning a humorous video about a Popeye's chicken shortage.  The segment included further discussion about the Blagojevich-Obama feud and a musical interlude with Soundgarden's "Wicked Garden."  The language used throughout this segment, including frequent use of racial slurs, mirrored the original broadcast's tone.


The next segment focused on "sin taxes" and government spending, expressing frustration with tax burdens and referencing governors Spitzer, Patterson, Blagojevich, and Sanford.  A recurring bit with numerous callers identified only as "Steve" provided vulgar one-liners.  Callers Pete (discussing increased insurance premiums) and Stryker (discussing a Colorado road and bridge tax) also contributed. The hosts commented on airport food, obesity, and electronic waste.  The segment featured a discussion of Kenny, a singer with a poorly-recorded version of Owl City's "Fireflies" and conflict with his producer, Troy Kwan, as well as Kenny's upcoming performance of Lady Gaga's "Bad Romance" and the hosts' plans to meet Lady Gaga.  The segment concluded with discussion of wrestler Ludwig Borga's death and a review of Dr. Drew's celebrity rehab show, mentioning William Shatner as a future guest.


The final segment heavily featured reality television, critiquing "Celebrity Rehab" and mocking Dr. Drew, while praising "16 and Pregnant."  The Kardashians were discussed, along with a vulgar anecdote. The segment also covered the "Lost" finale/State of the Union scheduling conflict.  A significant portion focused on intern "Love Buzz" and his offensive "A-Hole Project" videos.  The hosts interacted with "the Virus" and "Infection" in a vulgar joke-off.  Other brief topics included their dislike for intern "Chip," Derek Jeter's upcoming marriage, reviews of "Avatar" and "The Hurt Locker," William Shatner's upcoming appearance, a planned interview with Bob Kelly, and Oliver Stone's documentary series.  The show concluded with humorous and unsuccessful attempts at a proper sign-off.

[00:00:00]  Thank you. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  I'm being a trumpeter.  I got a catchy name.  Shit radio.  All right.  We hit a low.  We have contact.  Oh my God.  Jimmy's face is all over her pussy.  Look at how small my butt hole is.  That's funny.  This is shit radio.  And it fucking stinks.  It stinks.  But enough of this palaver.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony show. 
[00:04:30]  How about that.  How about that.  Jim Norton back in house.  Yes.  What's that?  Hey, Jimmy.  Jim, we had an amazing show Friday.  I heard.  Good luck trying to compete with Friday show, my friend.  It was a good one.  You better show your hiney hole or something because Gallagher.  Some people say it's one of the best shows we've done in years.  I heard Gallagher was very, very good.  Gallagher was insane.  He was a little upset.  What?  With us.  And Patrice. 
[00:05:00]  Well, we hinted he might be a racist.  And Patrice.  Out of nowhere, by the way.  Right.  He didn't deserve it.  I hint of any evidence of him being a racist.  He didn't deserve any of it.  These subtle accusations started coming in.  And then freaking Patrice is like, watermelon, you know.  Why is it that he smashed watermelon?  And then I'm like, Gallagher, you want to be smashing eggplant?  And then Anthony made some kind of observation about fire hoses and his act.  It was just terrible. 
[00:05:30]  He's looking at us completely insane.  Yeah.  He was out of his mind.  And he sure can babble.  Oh, yeah.  You give him a chance and he'll just keep babbling.  That's why you've got to shut him up with accusations that have no merit.  I just want to know.  I was trying to find out all weekend.  I want to know if people went to his shows.  Yeah.  I'd like to know if he actually sold tickets.  Where did he work?  He had three different shows in the area.  Was he the brokerage? 
[00:06:00]  Oh, the reason it went down, Jim, because Patrice goes to Gallagher, you've got to change  your act, man.  You're the same old Gallagher.  You've got to reinvent yourself.  So he's telling him to shave his mustache, shave his head.  He wants him to go by his first name, Leo.  And Patrice would do nothing but call him Leo.  And Gallagher wants to keep just Gallagher.  He's a one-named guy.  So he wants to keep that.  And Patrice is like, look, Leo. 
[00:06:30]  He goes, I watch you.  You say a lot of stuff.  He goes, you can say a lot of things that are pretty profound and worldly, very Carlin-esque,  a lot of your stuff.  He goes, then you goof it all up with some goofy hammer shit.  He goes, you've got to just knock that shit off, shave the mustache off, cut your goofy  hair, and get out there.  And Gallagher was like, I'm not going to do that and conform.  And then he took it as an insult instead of... 
[00:07:00]  Well, how could he not?  Right.  He's been smashing things for 30 years.  And Patrice is like, that's a smashing act of yours?  But knowing Patrice, it's just like, that was just Patrice saying, look, here's what you  got to do if you want to, you know, be Gallagher in the new century.  You can't do the same shit you were doing in 1980s Showtime specials.  Right.  But Gallagher didn't take it that way.  And then, I don't know how the...  I think Ovi just came out and said, Gallagher, are you a racist out of nowhere? 
[00:07:30]  And Gallagher, like, paused and just went, why?  Greatest answer to that question ever.  He didn't say no, yes, or anything.  He just went, why?  And then we all just went, oh, shit.  And then it was nothing but Gallagher racist jokes the entire time left that he was here.  And I'm proud of my pal, Anthony, because I think usually I'm the one that, I just said  I think, I'm usually the one that takes it too far.  We all saw that Gallagher was about to snap, and Anthony just kept fucking pushing and pushing 
[00:08:00]  Oh, I would not lay off on the racist jokes.  Gallagher.  And what was the one that put him over the top?  I forgot what it was, but it was one.  Yeah, I don't even remember.  I can't believe you went there.  Oh, my God.  It was fun.  Yeah, I heard he got a little miffed.  It was a little miffed.  He'll be back.  Now, I was talking to Kenny on the way up in the elevator.  Why would you do that to yourself?  I know, I know, because he's in there.  It's a small area.  He's in there.  I have to chat. 
[00:08:30]  To the end of the buttons.  Yeah, I'd rather, you know, talk to the buttons.  Pick up the emergency phone.  Hello, how are you doing this morning?  Hello.  Anyone out there?  Hello.  But he said, yes, it was very cold in Texas, where Jimmy was.  Coldest day since the 30s, yeah.  Wow.  And what the hell?  He said, oh, your plane trip with the noisy people behind you?  I almost had the air agent.  Do you just want to fucking choke someone?  Wait, what happened?  We were just sitting together, and there was two people behind us, and the woman was just 
[00:09:00]  loud, like, but not being mean loud.  Just one of those people who kind of talked at this volume.  Oh, my God.  And the entire conversation was like this, and you could hear everything she was saying,  and she had a haircut like Moe Howard.  She wasn't retarded.  She was just an ugly, skinny lady, and she would not shut the fuck up, and she woke me  up, and the only reason I didn't say anything to her that was nasty is, like, because you 
[00:09:30]  wouldn't if it was Suge Knight, so I'm like, I won't yell at, like, little old ladies or  whatever, because I'm like, you can't yell at a fucking chick, because you wouldn't  yell at Suge Knight, so don't be a pussy and yell at a lady.  That's how you go about your life?  Yeah, because it doesn't make a tough time to yell at a fucking law.  Then you wouldn't yell at anybody.  No, no.  I take on all easy targets.  Fuck that.  Easy.  Fuck that.  Great.  But we all do.  We size up the competition, and then you go, well, I think I could yell at this person,  because I think I could take them. 
[00:10:00]  Shut up, you head.  All easy targets.  And I finally snapped and said, like, at this volume,  hey, Kenny, what time do we land?  And how did you respond?  He didn't even play along.  I'm like, hey, Kenny, what time do we land?  And then I screamed back, I don't know.  I'm trying to be quiet and rest.  He didn't even go with it.  What an asshole. 
[00:10:30]  That's awesome.  Silence behind us.  Oh, really?  Oh, it worked.  It worked like a hand with a glove slapping two faces.  Good.  Yeah, good for you, man.  What's going on with air travel, though?  Oh, it's fucking annoying.  No, because there was another incident with the landing gear at, was that in Newark?  United Airlines flight.  They had to land on the right side of the plane or the right engine or what the heck.  Yeah, they had one gear that didn't come down or something.  Some shenanigans.  You notice, though?  They know how to deal with those. 
[00:11:00]  There's more and more incidents, though.  Well, you know, you get the economy goes down, people make cuts, and then before you know  it, the planes ain't working as good.  They had to lay a few mechanics off.  The lube guy is now on the unemployment line, so now...  Hydraulic guy.  That's what I'm saying, right?  Now that instead of three hydraulic guys, there's two.  And what happened?  I don't want to fly anytime soon.  I think I'll start flying by the end of the year again.  That one landing gear not coming down gag, I mean, if a pilot can't handle that, get 
[00:11:30]  the fuck out of the cockpit.  Well, how does he land?  Wait, but what...  Explain it further, and you know this stuff.  So, what did he land on?  If the right side didn't come down.  They land on the nose wheel and the right wheel.  Nose wheel, right...  No, it was left wheel, right?  Because wasn't the right side out?  Not that it matters.  In that one, it looks like the left gear isn't down.  Well, whatever gear is down, you land on that and the nose wheel, and then you keep the  wing up as long as possible. 
[00:12:00]  You just try your damnedest, and then it slowly comes down in the engine and scrapes along  on the runway.  Nice.  And then the cruise comes out.  Woo, woo, woo, woo.  And the foam and...  All that fun stuff.  The slides come out.  Why is it a long way for the fire trucks to get to where the plane is on the runway?  Yeah, they should wait at the end.  Right, why don't they wait where this thing is going to come to rest?  Because I think they don't want to be part of a fiery cataclysm that's cartwheeling down  the runway or something goes amiss. 
[00:12:30]  They don't want to be hit by the body parts that are flying toward their fire trucks.  And it's always the same interview with the passengers.  It's like, well, it seemed like a normal landing.  We touched down, and then you do notice a very loud noise and a bang, and say, yeah,  because there's no wheel there.  But initially, it supposedly, thank God I haven't been on one.  I don't want to be on a plane that does that.  But initially, it just feels like you're landing.  And they say this is a passenger chair pilot in Newark miracle. 
[00:13:00]  I don't know about the miracle.  Not quite a Sully in the...  A Sully's was a miracle.  It really was.  This is like...  Come on.  It happens.  Have you been seeing the commercials for the Sully special there?  Another Sully special?  There's going to be a big special on, what is that, Discovery or some shit?  Yeah.  What?  And they're going to show...  They showed some really cool computer-generated graphics of the whole thing,  and then they're going to talk to Sully, talk to the passengers. 
[00:13:30]  They're going to take Sully up in a plane, the same route,  and he's going to describe exactly what happened.  Kind of a...  Oh, really?  Enough with Sully.  For what?  You see where that tree lining is there?  That's about where my eyes were fixed when we first saw the geese.  Pretty much it.  My partner said geese,  and I heard a thwack of the goose hitting the engine.  I don't think you want something... 
[00:14:00]  What happened to Sully?  I don't think you want that in your life.  Because now the rest of your life, that's all you talk about.  That's pretty much it.  Yeah.  You think Sully's answering any other questions except what happened that day?  Yeah.  How was the last flight you did, Sully?  Pretty routine.  We took off, landed.  Everything was fine.  You think you're sick of talking about it by now?  No.  Sully seems to be the kind of guy that really basks in the spotlight of this.  He seems like the kind of guy that wouldn't be.  Right.  Like he would just be like, eh, whatever.  But wherever he goes, that's all people are asking. 
[00:14:30]  I give it another year, and he snaps.  He completely snaps.  Cartwheeling plane in Nebraska, wherever the hell that was.  That pilot lived.  Denny Fish was one.  He wasn't the main pilot, but he was in the air flight.  That was in Iowa, I think.  It was in Iowa, right?  It was the United DC 10.  Yeah, yeah.  In a cornfield.  A lot of people lived through that one.  Half, yeah.  But, you know, that guy, eh, John Testrake, when they took him hostage on the runway in,  where was that, Beirut, I think it was. 
[00:15:00]  And, you know, he's another hero.  Where do these guys go?  Sully's out there.  Hey, look at me.  I'm Sully.  He's at the Rose Bowl parade or whatever.  New Year's Eve, New Year's Day.  There's the commercial part.  Sully visiting the plane.  Padding the plane.  There's a computer-generated flight and first-hand accounts.  For the passengers, a flight 1549.  This guy goes, oh, my God, in 30 seconds, you know, you're going to die.  One year later.  I guess you've got to do the one year later thing.  See, from the pilot's perspective, there he is in the plane talking about what he saw. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, that's pretty cool.  You know what?  I think we've got to see this.  I'll watch this in a second.  And then after that, all right, enough with Sully.  Then we should flog him publicly and say, all right, move on with your life, stupid.  Can't we have our heroes, Opie?  Speaking of flogging someone publicly, and it's in the same subject here, they found  that dummy that went through the ropes to kiss his girlfriend.  That guy should be flogged publicly.  Was he an Asian guy?  Asian guy who, you know, snuck under the ropes to walk his chick to her flight. 
[00:16:00]  Are you kidding me?  Everyone knows you can't do that.  It's not 1973.  You can't go walking up to the gate with your pal anymore.  And because of that, we got some stupid guy with a guitar singing to Newark Airport for  six straight hours.  Was there a guy entertaining everybody?  Oh, you haven't seen that on YouTube yet?  Great.  Wait till you see Beatle Guy.  He's going to be the guy, man.  Oh, shut it.  I'm going to bring everyone together. 
[00:16:30]  That guy.  And get them through this long, long wait.  You haven't seen this yet?  No.  I blame security, too.  I mean, a lot more than I blame that stupid guy going to kiss his chick.  This is called Stuck in Newark Airport with Total Strangers.  You want to hit play?  Oh, sorry.  I thought it was fun.  Ah, Danny.  Does a little sing-along for everybody.  Here we go.  Three, four.  Jimmy walked away from the microphone. 
[00:17:00]  Come on, Jimmy.  It's the spirit.  It's the human spirit.  Look at this.  You know what I want to hear?  Complete strangers.  They're all just getting along.  Everyone's just having a little fun.  C-Terminal. 
[00:17:30]  This would be good if it was 9-11 or something, where there was some horrible reason they were  stranded.  Yeah.  This was just an annoying inconvenience.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Some idiot.  They should arrest him.  Yeah.  Starting on.  He's the one that snuck in.  To sell CDs.  But they got the Asian guy.  What kind of crime?  I would gather.  F-ing up with security. 
[00:18:00]  Going in through the outdoor.  Security screwed up, though.  I mean, someone's supposed to be there stationed at that in-out thing the whole time.  Why can't they just build walls?  Well, because people got to leave there.  Well, no.  The wall where the rope would be.  Where they take the rope down or whatever.  That thing.  What is that thing called where they stretch?  The thing.  You know, you're online at the movie theater.  What is it called?  The velvet rope.  It's not really.  What is it?  It's like a ribbon thing.  Yeah.  And you pull it, and then you have to get it back in. 
[00:18:30]  Well, I think when people are leaving, they open that up.  Oh, okay.  And that guy decided to duck under it.  They fucking found him, man.  And there's a lot of people that want to get their hands on air.  And he was milling about, and security told him, hey, you're not allowed over here.  Get out of here.  And then he left for a second, and then security left, and then he ducked under the rope and  walked his sweetie pie.  No, what a wimp.  We've all been at an airport where you had to say goodbye to a loved one. 
[00:19:00]  And when you see him walk away, it's pretty sad.  This fucking guy, though, couldn't take that and had to go follow her.  You know what I do with it?  At the curb.  At the fucking curb.  Beat it, stupid.  You think I'm going to park my fucking car and take the time that it takes to walk back  out and the luggage and everything?  Here you go.  All right, officer, I'm leaving in a second.  I got to go.  Go ahead.  It's in there.  The big planes are in there.  Remember the old days, though?  You would walk right to the gate and see him get on the plane, basically.  You'd be smoking a lucky. 
[00:19:30]  Hi, well, you take care.  Let me make sure you have a good seat.  You walk in the plane with the person.  Sit down.  Get a pillow.  Let me help you with your bag.  Thanks a lot, 9-11.  Yeah.  I remember seeing, like, people waving goodbye through the tiny little window.  Through the window.  Because they had a window seat and you were still at their gate.  And they're in the terminal by the glass waving.  Right.  Smoking up a storm.  Right.  Oh, it's great.  Firearms.  They didn't give a shit.  Unbelievable.  Guy's got one of those old school cartoon TNT bombs in his hand. 
[00:20:00]  They didn't give a shit.  I never mind saying goodbye because it's always at my front door as we see the cab pull out.  You're nicer than me if you go to the airport.  Am I having that lonely fucking drive back?  That is true, too.  I've done that.  I schedule them the size for when her flight is scheduled to take off.  I'm sorry.  Can't make it.  You ever have one where they go, well, I'm leaving now.  And you can't even muster up enough strength to get out of bed or off the couch or something. 
[00:20:30]  All right.  All right, man.  Look at this.  Is the cab here?  Call me when you get home, I guess.  Yeah.  They're leaving your place and you can't even be bothered to get out of bed.  I am pretty bad, especially these days, because I'll just punch up, like, my front door, my front yard camera and be like, cab's here.  Like, I won't even stand by the door and wait, you know.  It's like, oh, we'll stand by the door and just wait, hold each other until the cab gets here. 
[00:21:00]  I'm just playing online poker with the fucking front door cam up.  There he is.  All right.  Take it easy.  Hey, it was fun.  It was fun.  All right.  Well, can we talk football?  Looks old.  My team and Jimmy's team have moved on.  Yes.  I fucking hate the Cowboys, Jimmy.  Why?  I just hate them.  Yeah, more than Eagles?  The dirty Eagles?  Well, you know, I got a little interest in the Philly teams.  A little.  I'm not an Eagles fan by any means. 
[00:21:30]  But honestly, the guys I hang out with in Philly, they're not even Eagles fans.  They got some weird dolphin thing going on.  What?  In Philly?  Dude, my in-laws are all into the Dolphins because, you know, Big Papa Ken there grew  up in Connecticut, and the first team he got into was the Dolphins, and then he moves to  Philly for his whole life, but he's still a Dolphins fan.  That still doesn't make sense.  How about our good friend Joey Paisano?  He's an Eagles fan, and he's a hardcore New Yorker.  Yeah, but Philly, New York, there are ties there that I won't speak about. 
[00:22:00]  No.  But not when it comes to sports teams.  Do you know anyone that is more New York than Joey Paisano?  He could be in every film about New York because he's that New York type of guy, and he's a huge  Eagles fan.  Huge.  It just happens for whatever reason.  Yeah.  No, I, I, Cowboys.  What, first playoff win since 96?  Since 96?  They were great, though.  They played really well, man.  The defense was solid.  How is that possible?  I know.  When they had that fact, uh, yesterday, or, was that two days ago now, I guess? 
[00:22:30]  Two days ago, right?  Yeah, Cowboys won on Saturday at 7 p.m.  Yeah, two days ago, they said first playoff win since 96.  I'm like, that cannot be possible.  Thirteen years?  Yeah.  Damn.  And Jerry Jones didn't have anyone killed?  It's amazing.  And stop showing Jerry Jones.  Enough.  I agree.  You never see any other owner as much as Jerry Jones during a football game.  I've had enough of Jerry Jones.  Enough of his face.  His red, his ruddy face.  And he was hanging with Bush, right? 
[00:23:00]  I thought that was Bush, yeah.  Yeah, Bush was all happy.  He tried to shake hands on him, and Bush just looked uncomfortable.  George W?  George W was at the game.  At the game, finally got to see him.  And that fucking screen they got.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Yeah, it's just retarded, huh?  And just like Avatar, we had this conversation last week.  How is it going to get better than the big fucking screen?  The giant screen.  That the Cowboys have.  How is it going to get better than that?  How?  No one's watching the game on the field because that screen is so amazing.  Virtual reality.  Right.  That's the first sports franchise where every seat is great. 
[00:23:30]  You could have the worst seat in the house.  You don't care because you're in the stadium with that giant screen to check out.  Do you want to watch the screen or do you want to watch the game?  Dude, have you seen the screen for real?  Not just pictures.  Not live.  Have you seen it in action?  You have no desire to see what's on the field unless you're really close.  Oh, my God.  You could care less.  You could care less what's going on in the field.  93,000 people were there at that game.  Yeah.  Look at the size of that.  It's crazy. 
[00:24:00]  It is massive.  Did the Cowboys look good?  I didn't really take a look at that game.  They looked really good.  They looked really good.  Yeah, I was surprised because they beat Philly.  They beat the shit out of Philly last week.  And I'm like, that's a bad sign.  Yeah.  But they killed them again.  Who do they play next?  I think they go to Minnesota.  Do they?  I could be wrong, but I think if they go to Minnesota.  With Brett Favre?  Yeah, it's not an easy game.  What do you think about the Jets?  Well, the Jets, this fucking Rex Ryan is a cocky motherfucker.  He's basically making plans for the big parade that happens after you win a Super Bowl. 
[00:24:30]  Oh.  He's got a whole schedule that he handed out to the boys.  Slow down.  He wants them to believe, Anthony.  Yeah, you gotta believe.  This Rex Ryan, he rules.  He fucking rules.  And the Jets have a really good defense.  And, you know, having a good defensive team gets you far in the playoffs.  That's for sure.  People know that.  Yeah.  And they looked pretty good.  Sanchez looked good.  Bengals didn't really show up.  And Ocho Cinco, well, he stinkoed.  Ocho Stinko.  Did you see Ocho's truck? 
[00:25:00]  I showed you before the show.  That was his birthday present to himself.  Jimmy, you see Ocho's truck?  He had it custom built.  I think it took six months or something like that.  And he gave it to himself for his birthday.  It's a little self-indulgent.  Of course it is.  Um, like, look at me, look at me.  Yeah.  And it even says Ocho Cinco on the side.  On the side, nice.  What is it?  It's basically the, uh...  I think it's a diesel tractor trailer looking Humvee kind of thing. 
[00:25:30]  Jimmy, look at Ocho's new truck.  How do you not give this video five stars?  What, you're going to see better than Ocho Cinco's truck?  Ocho Cinco's truck is stupid.  You wouldn't...  Paul Brown Stadium today, this is his birthday present to himself.  He said it took him six months to build that thing.  It's like a little tractor trailer. 
[00:26:00]  Paul Brown Stadium earlier today in his brand new birthday present.  You know what?  I actually like that.  I thought it was going to be some obnoxious thing with his name on...  His name is small, like, you know, like on the side where it says Peterbilt or whatever.  Peterbilt, yeah.  It's Ocho Cinco.  It's not obnoxious.  It's a big black cab with a sleeper.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  That's a fucking cool truck, man.  Anything.  How many miles per gallon do you think that thing is?  Yeah.  For real.  Not too many.  That's what I need to know.  What does your Escalade get?  Uh, not a lot. 
[00:26:30]  About?  About highway?  Yeah.  Probably 12.  So this thing's got to get about five or six tops.  Tops.  Well, he had a horrendous game, so the Jets move on.  We play the Chargers because the stupid Patriots lost.  Yeah, the Pats lost.  Pats win.  I think we were going to play the Colts.  Chargers are tough, though.  Tough.  Patriots didn't look good at all yesterday.  And they had a big, uh, you know, goodbye, goodbye to Giants Stadium thing, and there 
[00:27:00]  is a chance that the Jets can be playing back in there one more time.  Really?  Yeah, I think so.  I didn't know that.  I, uh, I think if they beat the...  Yeah, if the Jets and the Ravens both win.  Yeah, the Jets and the Ravens both win.  Because the Ravens are the only team seated lower than the Jets.  Right.  The Jets would be the home team.  Then they'd be the home team and one more game at the stadium.  How great would that be?  Yeah.  And then the, uh, the second game yesterday, please tell me you guys saw some of it.  And they scored almost 100 points.  What was the final score? 
[00:27:30]  51 to...  What was the final score?  51...  51-45.  51-45.  Cardinals beat the Packers.  Did you see this game?  Nine.  They were pretty much scoring on every possession.  51-45.  Was that the over or under?  Did it do well?  Jeez.  51-45 in overtime.  Highest scoring playoff game ever.  It was unbelievable.  It's always a new record.  Yeah.  No matter what.  It was...  I'm tired of new records.  It was just an unbelievable shootout yesterday. 
[00:28:00]  What'd they do?  Play for like three weeks or something?  Oh, no.  Oh, I forgot.  Oh, shit.  Ah.  Yeah.  Ah, that reminds me.  And the game was over on a dumb play.  A fumble.  Oops.  Yeah.  Cardinals picked it up and ran it in nice and easy.  Oh, jeez.  And that was that.  Not over yet.  Was there a big lead at one point?  45-45.  Yeah, it was a great comeback.  What was that?  The Cardinals were up like 33-10 or something. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  The game was over.  It really was.  And then the Packers just marched back.  This Rodgers is a pretty good quarterback, huh?  It's the worst when you come back hard and then lose.  That sucks, man.  So.  You should have played like that from the start.  How do you do that?  Yeah.  Like when they come back.  It's like, well, what did you do?  All of a sudden pour it on?  That's what I hate when like a team is down and they got to come back and right in the  last two minutes, they're playing like amazing, but they come up short. 
[00:29:00]  Play like that for eight minutes.  Fucking Kurt Warner.  Jesus Christ, this Kurt Warner.  My God.  That's a pact.  They got this quarterback.  This Rodgers is all right.  See, look.  A little fumble action.  Look at the goddamn camera angles and the clarity and it's just astounding to watch a  game at home now.  I don't know.  Just to be at the game is one thing, but you sure as shit are not going to the game  to watch a better version of it than you can see on television. 
[00:29:30]  If you go to the Cowboys game.  Well, yeah, yeah.  Because they got that big screen where you can check out all the replays and stuff.  But I mean, yeah.  You are right though.  I mean, most sporting events, it's way better to stay home and watch.  You got that camera on the cable that just follows the guys on the, like you're, like  you're running away from the guys.  It's fantastic.  Yeah, they got to figure it out.  They just got to get rid of some of those dumb announcers though, man. 
[00:30:00]  I could not even tell you who's doing announcing for who or anything.  Well, there's one.  I just, you got to get rid of Bob Costas.  Yeah.  Well, you're not a big Costas fan.  Well, I mean, because it's simple.  I'll say it again.  He just tries to make moments.  It's like, you don't have to make moments.  Just let them happen.  Like Sterling.  He's so excited to be there and I'll tell you why because back in 1931, blah, blah,  blah, blah, blah.  All right.  It's just cool.  Shut the fuck up and show the pictures. 
[00:30:30]  You know?  Yeah.  You don't have to force that shit.  It speaks for itself.  And another one I can't stand and this is a little strange because my girl goes, Keith  Olbermann is calling sports.  That's where the age difference is.  I go, well, Keith Olbermann used to be on ESPN with Dan Patrick and that's when I actually  loved Keith Olbermann and a lot of people would say that.  And now with that MSNBC show of his, he's such a douche.  And then now they move him back to sports. 
[00:31:00]  I can't fucking watch him anymore.  Is he doing that?  And I used to love the guy when he was doing sports.  Is he doing both now?  MSNBC?  Yeah.  He does, what is it called?  Sunday night fucking football or whatever.  No, what is it called?  Something America.  What is it, Travis?  It's football night in America.  Football night in America, right.  On Sunday.  So they show all the highlights of the games, but it's Keith Olbermann.  Not the old guy, you know, that was doing ESPN.  I should probably agree with Keith more than I do Hannity, but I think Olbermann's... 
[00:31:30]  Ah, I hate him.  Fucking hate him.  I hate KO.  Fucking KO.  How was your weekend?  Pretty good.  Pretty mellow.  You didn't watch the football games.  No, I watch a lot of movies and, you know, documentaries and shit.  I barely watch a football.  I'll be...  I'm like one of those, you know, hey, who's in the Super Bowl?  I'll go over a party or have a party.  But as far as weekends go, football, I'm not going to sit there and commit that much time. 
[00:32:00]  But these games are great.  The playoff games are amazing.  I know.  You can get into any one of these games.  I catch the clips.  I catch the highlights.  But for the most part, it's, you know, hey, what's going on?  I'll crack open a bottle of wine and just sit there and crank the fire up.  Nice.  Because it was real cold.  You know, the weekend was fucking freezing.  So I didn't want to go out anywhere.  Just did that.  What was your best movie that you watched this weekend?  Oh, shit. 
[00:32:30]  I was watching a bunch of movies I'd seen before.  Why?  Like that's...  Because I kind of do that every so often.  But the element of surprise is gone.  Yeah, I know.  I just do it so I can incorporate, you know, new sounds into the show.  It's constant research on the program is why I'm doing that.  No, I watch a fuckload of those forensic files and, you know, this person was missing.  No, but what movie?  Um, you know, I don't even remember what the hell I threw in. 
[00:33:00]  I watch Harry Potter.  The new one?  No, the one before the new one, I think.  I'm catching up.  Who do you think?  Jesus Christ.  Give me a break.  I know.  That is such a tell.  I'm like, Harry Potter.  Anthony wouldn't just throw in a Harry Potter movie.  I wouldn't.  Because I've talked about Harry Potter on the show and tried to defend that it's actually  cooler and darker than most people think.  Oh, believe me.  And you're usually like, oh, shut up. 
[00:33:30]  It's a dumb kid's movie.  It's better than watching Degrassi.  I don't watch that.  What's that?  Oh, some kid's show.  Oh, okay.  I'm a fan of iCarly and Wizards of Waverly.  Oh, Christ.  Oh, no, you're not.  Yes, I am.  Oh, my God.  That's terrible.  You haven't seen Wizards of Waverly yet?  No.  You haven't lived, my friend.  That's Selena Gomez.  Way better than Miley Cyrus.  Haven't watched that one yet.  I've seen her.  I've seen her. 
[00:34:00]  You've seen Selena, right?  I like watching these shows where someone's missing, someone's murdered, and then they  go through the parade of the usual suspects, right?  Mm-hmm.  And you don't know who did it.  Now, they've come upon a gimmick that is fan-fucking-tastic.  And not many people have caught on to this.  But it's great.  Because they used to blow it right from the get-go.  Like, all right, wife is murdered, kid's murdered, the husband's grieving, they show 
[00:34:30]  the news footage of him on the stoop, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I take husband every time in that case.  Everyone goes, guilty, guilty, guilty, husband.  Husband every time.  Then they show the news person talking to the husband in his prison jumper, and, you  know, with a guard behind him and some bars, and you go, all right, he did it.  Now, it's going to be interesting to see how he did it, why, and everything.  But now, and now I know he did it.  Right.  Why would you do that?  Here's the, but they used to do it that way. 
[00:35:00]  Now, they don't do it like that anymore.  Okay, good.  Now, they give the motherfucker some kind of business suit, Dickie, and they put a back-like  drop on it and blur the backdrop so it almost looks like books and a lamp and a couch.  What?  Hold on a minute.  Hold on, hold on.  And then they're sitting there interviewing the guy from prison.  They are.  Yes.  But you don't know it.  So, they make it look like...  Like he's sitting in his living room.  How did they get away with that one?  I don't know, but it's great.  That's awesome.  Because then at the end, you're like, that's the motherfucker that did it. 
[00:35:30]  And then they show him...  But can you tell?  I can tell now.  I go, he's so guilty.  But the Irish person can't?  No.  I bet you?  No.  Oh, that's classic.  I can just tell.  Right now, the show starts.  And within eight minutes in, I go, that motherfucker did it.  That's awesome.  Yeah.  But it's good.  They have really...  I've been tricked a few times, though, where they got the guy in the suit.  It's like, that can't be prison.  Wife murdered.  Kids murdered. 
[00:36:00]  Husband every time.  I mean, every time.  And this was, this one, one of them I watched was hysterical.  It's, this guy left a bunch of messages.  He went to work.  Apparently, he killed his wife and his kid.  And then goes to work.  How do you...  I don't know.  I watch these and go, how do you function at work?  Thinking, I killed my wife and kid!  Her lifeless eyes are just laying in the dining room at your house.  Fucking hazed over, white, wrapped up in a tarp in your trunk. 
[00:36:30]  Jesus.  And then he's leaving all these messages like,  Hi, honey, I'm at work.  How are you?  Hope everything's fine.  Uh, hi, hon.  Um, just wonder where you are.  Uh, hope you're not, you know, murdered or anything.  He left, like, four messages when he never leaves a message.  And then his 911 call was like,  Oh, my God, my wife! 
[00:37:00]  My wife!  Uh, sir, where are you calling from?  My house!  And my wife is missing!  And oh, there's blood!  I think it was Louie Baines!  His acting's horrific.  How bad were his messages?  Oh, there was...  Dude, there was so bad.  It wasn't just one.  Hey, call me when you get this.  It was...  No, and it's like,  Hmm, wonder where you are.  Hope you, uh...  And whatever the kid's name is.  Hope you guys are having fun!  What a rookie. 
[00:37:30]  It was so obvious...  What a rookie.  ...that he never leaves these messages.  This is what you should do.  One phone call from work,  and then when you go home,  you fucking punch yourself in the ball so hard  and then call 911.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  You gotta get some emotion going.  You gotta...  You fucking just give yourself a nut shot  and at that moment pick up the phone  and you'll sound...  So you're tearing up?  You'll sound sincere.  Dude, these cops are fucking amazing.  They sit these guys down 
[00:38:00]  and start talking,  and then the cop will be like,  You know, right when I started talking to him,  I noticed by his body language  and he wasn't...  And they say,  I know a lot of people  take grief and loss in different ways,  but when they show no emotion  and they're talking about things  that really don't even make sense  as far as the murder goes,  they're not freaking out  asking who did this and what.  Like, they just know  from years of experience 
[00:38:30]  that you motherfucker,  you're guilty.  They also said if you throw a guy in a cell,  the guilty guy usually falls asleep.  They said the guy who's not guilty  will fall asleep  because your wife's dead  and you're in jail for it.  You didn't do it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So you're freaking and screaming  and...  The guy's just like,  I'm gonna snooze.  I'm gonna take a little nap.  Yeah, let me know what happens  to my murdered wife  who had nothing to do with.  Sleep like a baby.  Because you're kind of tired 
[00:39:00]  because you spent the whole night  hacking her body  into many different pieces.  Many little pieces, I should say.  Love those shows, though.  Can't get enough of them.  Yeah, you're a big fan.  You can't get away with it.  Have you seen all of them?  You know something?  There's so many of them  and so many different ones.  I haven't seen them all.  And now new seasons  are starting up  of the first 48  and Forensic Files.  Then they got that other one  where some...  What was it?  Paula Zahn is doing one  where she interviews the people. 
[00:39:30]  Those are the people  in the suits and ties.  Guilty, guilty.  You got me into it.  I'm starting to take a peek  at the first 48 hours.  The first 48 hours.  Let's say hi to Bill in Boston.  Bill!  Hey, Opie.  Oh, Bill!  Opie, thanks for the little chat room  yesterday morning.  Oh, yeah.  No worries.  I was Mechanic Bill.  We're talking about Neil Young.  Oh, cool.  Yeah, nothing wrong with Neil Young.  There's no memory of you.  Are you a Patriots fan?  I don't know.  I don't give a shit.  Thanks, Jimmy.  Appreciate it.  It's all right,  but I only expected Opie to go. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, my God, you?  That was amazing, that chat.  I remember he was talking  about Neil Young a little.  You know, you thought he was  talking about somebody else.  You thought it was  something else young.  All right, you're going to ruin it.  Crosby, Stills, Young,  and fucking Neil.  You're going to ruin it.  I just want to let you guys know  that Ocho Cinco's truck  will be perfectly right.  Five to six miles per gallon.  Yeah, he can afford it, though.  How much attention  does he need, though?  He can afford it.  He's loaded.  He's great on Twitter, though, Ocho.  He's hilarious.  Yeah, you following Ocho?  A little bit. 
[00:40:30]  A little bit.  He does crazy stuff  with his fucking fans, so...  All right, why don't we  take our first break, Ant?  All right.  You know what will be  the highlight of the day for me?  What?  Brand new birthday clip  from the news.  Oh, yeah, where is that?  Oh, my God.  Huh?  Are we going to play it  off the computer today?  Yeah, that's pretty easy.  All right, why don't we  play it right after the break?  Let's do that, because...  We'll get right into it  after the break?  Yeah.  It's so...  Is it a good one? 
[00:41:00]  It's so goddamn funny.  Yeah.  Is it the best one yet?  Uh...  They're so hard to judge  because they're all different  and lovable in their own way.  Okay.  But this one features  somebody very popular  on the program.  Do you?  No, no, no.  I haven't been featured.  Why haven't you been featured?  I don't know.  I don't have a real,  you know,  a go-to character.  You can say that again.  And we're going to have 
[00:41:30]  an exclusive  about the Jay Leno thing.  Jimmy's going to tell all  after the break.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  What's up, everybody?  Wah.  Everybody.  We got to do  the birthday announcement  right away.  Yeah, I want to hear that.  Same station?  No.  A brand new one.  And this is only,  it seems to be  only for children, right?  Yeah, it did look to see, 
[00:42:00]  it did look that way  watching the entire video.  It's Breakfast Birthdays  brought to you by  Midway Family Fun Park.  So what they do  is they just have  little kids' birthdays.  Okay.  So sometimes,  you know,  the age might seem  a little funny.  Yeah.  But believe me,  it fits.  All right.  It's funny.  One to add to the collection.  Today,  sharing the day  with you,  with Tony,  with Elvis,  all the big hitters  celebrating today.  Yes.  Here's Christian. 
[00:42:30]  Ninth birthday for Christian.  Lots of love  for Mommy, Daddy,  Luca,  and all your friends  at Pope John,  the 23rd school.  I think it's 23rd.  Did I do that?  Yeah.  Is that right?  Yeah.  Have a fantastic day  and exciting birthday party.  I know because  our producer Kent Mannen  told me this morning.  Oh, did he?  I was like,  what is that?  Okay, good.  Happy Fourth Birthday Wishes  going out to Riley.  Happy Birthday to you, Riley.  Love for Mommy, Daddy,  Big Sister Sky,  and Little Brother Tanner.  Isabella Lajeunesse  is turning six years old today.  Aw, isn't she pretty? 
[00:43:00]  Lots of love for Mommy, Daddy,  Danica,  and her puppy Jesse.  Happy belated  First Birthday Wishes  going out to Alexia,  Alexia Christina Parisi.  We all love you so much  from the entire entourage  of family and friends  and, of course,  Mom and Dad.  It's 12th birthday today  for Teddy Shecklin.  Teddy,  happy birthday to you  from your Uncle Paul  and Marmalade.  Marmalade?  Yeah, fair enough.  That's what it says here.  Steve, see you in all your friends  down at the Emporium.  Yeah.  Happy second birthday 
[00:43:30]  with Miss Teddy Shecklin.  Little Teddy Shecklin.  And the kid had a wow shirt  under the fucking jacket.  Little Teddy Shecklin.  Little Teddy Shecklin.  Man Marmalade  and all your friends  down at the Emporium.  That's great.  Teddy Shecklin.  That's fucking classic.  That looks like he's 31  doing that fucking picture.  Yeah, let's hear that one again.  Little Teddy Shecklin.  Teddy Shecklin.  Yeah, good old Teddy Shecklin. 
[00:44:00]  Happy birthday, Teddy.  Jesus, that's awesome.  And, of course, Mom and Dad.  It's 12th birthday today  for Teddy Shecklin.  Teddy,  happy birthday to you  from your Uncle Paul  and Marmalade.  Aunt Marmalade.  Yeah, apparently.  That's what it says here.  Steve, see you in all your friends  down at the Emporium.  Aunt Marmalade.  That's his second birthday  with Miss Teddy Shecklin.  Marmalade.  Oh, that is so fucking good, man.  It sounds like a fan  of the show or something.  Oh. 
[00:44:30]  Jesus, Jimmy.  How did they get  Aunt Marmalade through?  Aunt Marmalade.  He goes, well,  that's what it says.  All right, we'll just read  anything here.  Ah, very good.  God, that's a good one.  Keep them coming.  Keep them coming.  Absolutely.  I can't get enough of those.  I don't know why I find them  so funny.  This is silly.  They're great.  So, Jimmy, what's going on  with Leno?  I'm sure you've heard that  a lot in the last few days.  I'm more concerned with  what's going on with Jimmy  with Leno.  I think you did 
[00:45:00]  really well for Leno  and I think you'll continue  when he goes back  to doing the Tonight Show.  I hope it's an hour  he gets back  and I hope he gets  the Tonight Show back.  Conan's so done.  He might be, yeah.  Conan O'Brien is so done.  They're just trying  to be nice guys at NBC  and go, look,  we want everybody.  They're hoping Conan walks  and then they don't have  to pay him his salary.  If he doesn't walk,  then they'll probably  boot him and just pay him off.  It seems like Jay...  You can't give Jay Leno  a half hour show.  He's got to be happy about it.  I don't think he ever  wanted to do 10 o'clock. 
[00:45:30]  And look,  they sold NBC,  got bought by Comcast  and a new guy came in  and I think he saw  what it was  and said,  what are you doing?  You're going to ruin both.  Because Leno was making  the money.  It wasn't a financial mistake.  No.  But he wasn't getting  the ratings that the affiliates  wanted and they were bitching.  I mean,  I'm just telling you  what's in the paper.  It's obvious.  Yeah, yeah.  So,  here's the problem I had.  People who didn't like his show,  that's fine,  you didn't like the show.  He's a guy who was thrown  with a brand new format  at 10 o'clock  and he had to change  everything he was doing  or a lot of what he was doing  and people were murdering him. 
[00:46:00]  He's a failure.  It was terrible.  None of these  fucking critics,  none of them  are going after Conan.  And I'm not even saying  that Conan  shouldn't be given time  because if you gave Conan,  it took Leno three years  for The Tonight Show.  If you gave Conan  a year,  two years,  maybe or maybe he wouldn't.  It's still too short to tell.  I have to jump in.  I don't think  you could give Conan  that much time  knowing that Jay Leno  was very successful  and still number one  in that time slot.  I agree.  So, I mean,  you yanked the number one guy  to bring in Conan  thinking he's going to be 
[00:46:30]  the future of your network.  He's got to get the job done  immediately.  And while you were gone  last week,  Ed and I were talking about this  and we both had this observation  that Conan O'Brien  pretty much fell off  the face of the map  with his show  being moved up an hour.  You don't hear anything about him.  No one's talking about  Conan O'Brien.  They were talking about him  when he was on Later.  Yep.  But no one's talking about  this new show of his.  What he did was,  because again,  people made their decision  on Conan already.  It wasn't like he was a new guy.  People knew Conan.  They either liked him  or didn't.  Same as Leno Letterman. 
[00:47:00]  So he comes down,  and he probably brings  his audience with him,  and then Dave is beating him  by two million people.  And again,  I'm not even shitting on Conan.  I'm really not.  It's just,  I don't like the fucking fact  that the critics,  none of them  were talking about that.  Yeah, yeah.  None of them.  And he didn't have  to change anything.  He stepped into  a number one spot,  and you're going to lose people.  It's just the way it is.  Of course.  But they're not  attacking him at all.  And people who I've talked to  who are real fans of the show  said the show did change  when he moved  to a certain degree.  So where are they?  Where are these fucking 
[00:47:30]  little faggot bloggers  and critics  attacking Conan  with the same venom  and the same purpose  that they were attacking  Leto for?  Yeah, he's right.  That's the only thing  that bugs me.  Again,  people who thought  Leto's show wasn't good,  or again,  that's just your,  you don't like it,  fine.  Sure.  It's that the lack of balance  makes me fucking crazy.  Makes me crazy.  So he's going back  to 1130.  Rumor is  Conan's got offers  from Fox.  Yeah, I'm sure he does.  He has to.  Yeah.  Who knows though?  I mean,  I don't know what's going 
[00:48:00]  to happen.  I really don't.  Well, NBC,  they want to look like  good guys,  so they're just going  to wait it out.  Yeah.  And hope that  Conan goes to Fox,  I think.  But then they've got  to compete against Conan,  so it's a weird little puzzle  they've got to figure out.  I don't think they care  about competing against Conan.  He's not proven  that he can do anything.  It makes Conan  less of a marketable commodity  at 1130  because  he had a tough time  against Dave  who,  you know,  it's Letterman.  And Letterman,  in fairness,  did have all that stuff  with the cheating.  It's like he had  a lot of stuff happen. 
[00:48:30]  Perfect timing.  Perfect timing  for the cheating.  Perfect.  If you're going to get  caught for cheating,  you might as well have it  to work out  in your favor.  When the other network  is shaking stuff up.  Right.  But I think that  Conan would have  a very tough time  against Leno.  I think what should happen  and this won't happen  is  Conan should just go back  to where he was.  Leno should go back  to where he was  and they should have  a joint press conference  where they say  it wasn't broke.  We tried to fix it.  And again,  this way,  everybody  is okay 
[00:49:00]  and they stay.  Leno goes,  hey,  I moved.  It didn't work out.  Conan goes,  I moved.  It didn't work out.  They can both stand there  and kind of fucking  take the beating  with the network  as opposed to  Conan looking worse  because he fucked up  at the Tonight Show  or Leno looking shitty  because he blew tight.  It's like,  it's all this shit.  I would love to see  them both just go,  eh,  it happened  and the network going,  it's our responsibility.  We should have left  these guys  who were both  kicking ass  where they were  and then everybody  goes back  and is happy.  Wow,  leave it alone.  That's going to be rough.  It's not going to happen,  but I mean.  That's going to be rough  for Conan  to swallow that pill. 
[00:49:30]  That's hard for Leno too,  I'm sure.  Leno had to swallow  the pill  when he went to 10 o'clock.  He had to swallow  the pill  and be booted  as number one.  He hadn't lost anything.  Like,  why?  We can learn  from this Leno.  Dude,  we can learn  from this Leno.  Because if that move  was done to you  and I  while we're on top,  we'd be motherfucking  everybody  and then we'd be  on the unemployment line.  Leno just kept  his mouth shut,  was a company guy,  did what they wanted  from him  and look,  they move him  right back into his slot. 
[00:50:00]  Rolls with the punches.  When he makes  a remark done,  I would love  to roll with the punches.  I don't know  how you do that.  Because when he makes  a comment,  it counts.  Like,  what he did was,  and I said this to him,  I'm like,  dude,  I said,  you're so smart  in interviews,  you never  give them anything  that they can  just run with.  And he's like,  you know,  you just kind of,  you take it  and he's just  very kind of like,  he's very ambiguous  about stuff.  And he's like,  because they try  to get you to say stuff.  He's like,  when they said  I wanted to go back  to 1130,  he's like,  the guy asked me  like three times 
[00:50:30]  in different ways.  Do you want to go back  to 1130?  I'm like,  yeah,  I'll just do  what they want me to do.  What if they wanted you  to go back to 1130?  I'll do what they want me to do.  Ah,  boom,  let me just go back to 1130.  It's like they try  to ask you a certain way  to get the response  they want,  and he's very smart  with that stuff.  He's a mouth off.  Well,  there's three great quotes  in the paper today  about the situation.  This is what Jay Leno  had to say.  To be fair,  NBC is working  on a solution.  They say,  in which all parties  will be screwed equally.  That's certain NBC touch.  Yep,  it's Leno,  just having fun with it.  Conan writes, 
[00:51:00]  or said,  NBC has come up  with an exciting new idea.  They want me  to follow Jay Leno.  And then Fallon  actually had the best one  of all three.  It will be interesting  to see how Jay and Conan  do against Dave  and how we do  against the perfect  push-up infomercial.  It's funny.  Fucking Fallon.  That's good.  What happens to Fallon?  His show has a nice  little buzz.  105 a.m.  is what they were saying.  Really?  Yeah.  But it's odd to me  that they would...  I think Fallon  has a buzz,  don't you think? 
[00:51:30]  I don't know  what the ratings are saying.  Why do you give  Conan and Fallon  an hour, though,  and give Jay a half hour?  It doesn't make sense.  They're not giving  Jay a half hour.  It doesn't make sense.  They can't.  They're not...  Mark my word,  I don't know shit.  Jay Leno  is not doing a half hour.  This is all about  negotiating  and just kind of  hanging in there.  There's contracts involved  and all that.  That's like you  just get up to speed  after a half hour.  Well, Leno's monologue  alone is what?  The first segment  on these shows  is about 12 minutes long  it seems, right?  I think he does 
[00:52:00]  the longest monologue.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a long monologue  and then he's got  some kind of other  goofy thing  and then the show's over.  That's it.  And then there's no guests?  Yeah.  Silly.  And you've got to have  time for Jimmy.  I hope so.  I know I'm scheduled  for tomorrow night  and I'm doing my...  The next uninvited guest  is actually the 11th.  You'll be on Leno  tomorrow night?  Yeah.  That's a nice spot  because everybody's  taking a peek now  and they'll be watching  the 11th.  People that haven't  been taking a peek  are now taking a peek  no matter what.  Now they'll look.  You'll be part of 
[00:52:30]  The Tonight Show  with Jay Leno.  You proved yourself.  If I don't know  what his format will be.  They've always had  correspondence and comedy  bits too so it's not like...  I hope he goes back  to what he loved doing  which was the big monologue  some bits up front  guest, guest, music.  Right.  Well, he's got to stick  with that formula.  I love that formula.  It worked.  It fucking worked.  And there's less room  for comedy correspondence  there but there's still  enough room.  Well, they did have guys  going out and doing bits  and it wasn't like  they didn't have it.  I think you got a spot  with Jay.  I don't know.  I really believe that. 
[00:53:00]  I hope so.  I think you proved yourself.  Well, speaking of Jay Leno  this is his monologue  from the 8th.  What day are we up to...  So this was Friday's monologue  when it was all going down.  Now here's some frightening news.  Kev, this will interest you.  Okay, what's up?  Well, the World Wide Fund  for Nature came out  with its list  of 10 species  most likely to be extinct  in the near future.  You know what number one was?  What's that?  Us.  Yes, us.  I guess you heard 
[00:53:30]  these rumors  that NBC is talking  about canceling our show.  You know what that means?  You know what that means?  I didn't sleep  with any of my staff  for nothing.  Actually,  you know,  if they did cancel us  it wouldn't be  an easy move for me  because I still haven't unpacked  from the last show  they canceled us.  Everything's still back there.  So it's fine.  No problem.  But to be fair,  to be fair,  NBC is working 
[00:54:00]  on a solution  they say  in which all parties  will be screwed equally.  So I think  it's that certain NBC touch.  I am proud to say  the post office  coming out  with the Jay Leno stamp.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  It gets canceled  after four months.  But you want to get the stamp.  Right after it.  Yeah.  And then Conan  from Friday. 
[00:54:30]  Let's see how he handled it.  Ladies and gentlemen,  thank you for that.  We've got a great show  for you tonight.  I have no idea  what time  You can hear it in his voice.  But that's a funny  You can hear it in his voice.  Yeah.  You can hear it in his voice.  He's defeated.  Poor Conan.  No idea what time  it will air,  but it's going to be  a great show.  Let me promise you that.  I don't know.  Don't set your  I'm going to screw up  a lot of DVRs with this.  I'm sure  I'm sure you've all 
[00:55:00]  heard the rumors,  ladies and gentlemen.  NBC has finally come up  with an exciting new idea.  They want me to follow  Jay Leno.  Wow.  They thought it was...  Wow.  I've got to sit down.  Yeah.  I've been working on this.  You're going to be all right?  Oh, they've got to  rewrite the history books  on that one.  Yeah.  I had a really weird day.  When I got to work  this morning,  there was a 1923  Duesenberg 
[00:55:30]  parked in my spot.  Yeah.  He's calling me later.  He'll call...  Eh, with no Duesenberg  in 23,  they didn't suckle 23.  Eh.  He does that  on the phone.  I do have to let you know  that, ladies and gentlemen,  I've been advised  until this whole thing  is sorted out,  NBC lawyers  have asked me  to refer to this program  as the  Sometime at Night show  with some white guy.  So, yeah.  Enjoy.  Thank you. 
[00:56:00]  It's funny.  He's doing it through...  Yeah, it's funny.  He's doing it through  clenched teeth, though.  Yeah.  He's getting the jokes out.  Getting big laughs.  And then, uh...  What the hell?  On Friday,  Craig Ferguson  from CBS  who has nothing  to do with this,  had a lot of fun  with the whole, uh...  Leno rumor.  This is the latest  I've heard.  I don't know if this is true,  but this is the rumor  I've heard.  This is the one  that's going around  the late-night circles.  Jay moves to, uh...  11.30,  and he does a half-hour show  between 11.30 and 12.  Then Conan does 12 to 1,  and then Fallon does 
[00:56:30]  1 to 2.  I think that's what...  That's what the rumor  is tonight.  I don't know  if that's going to happen.  And I'm thinking,  where's Carson Daly  and all of this?  But...  Uh-huh.  But I have to tell you,  when I watch the other,  you know, NBC  making this terrible  mess of their schedule,  and the guys  that they're moving...  They're nice guys.  I know these guys.  They're perfectly nice guys.  They're professional.  They're good at their jobs,  but they get moved around,  and when I watch  the other guys  making a mess of it,  I think...  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! 
[00:57:00]  And then...  It's kind of like  when you're playing  a game of football  and there's a guy  coming to tackle you  and he kind of trips  and you go...  Ha-ha-ha-ha!  Anyway, I just want to assure you this, as, you know, the other guys, they're doing all this stuff, they're making all these mistakes, but I do like to think that we still make the crappiest late night TV.  But what did we do? We sucked at the same damn time every night. 
[00:57:30]  I guess we didn't have to play that. Whatever.  So there you go.  A lot of people give him props.  You're not a big fan of the Craig Ferguson?  I'm a big fan of the Craig Ferguson.  I kind of take a look here once in a while.  No.  Can't be bathered.  So Jimmy will be on Leno tomorrow night.  Yes, it's a round panel discussion, like one of those discussion things with Corolla and Meghan McCain.  Why Meghan McCain again? Why? Why? 
[00:58:00]  Because, because.  Because, because.  I don't know.  And then when does Jay go off the air? Right before the Olympics?  12th. His last show is the 11th.  The Olympics are a couple weeks away?  Yeah.  A month away, I guess?  Winter Olympics. Where the hell are they?  Somewhere up in Canada?  In some mountain.  Vancouver.  Vancouver.  Vancouver. Oh, thank you, Canadian guy.  Vancouver.  Fucking Canadian. Traitor.  Hey, are they?  Wait a minute. Curling is back already?  Already.  Get the fuck out of here. 
[00:58:30]  Can you believe it?  Was that four years ago that we made fun of curling?  Four short years ago.  We were obsessed with curling.  Yes.  And that shit was going on while we were doing our show.  Yeah, we were watching curling, remember?  We got into it.  People got so angry with us that we were watching curling during the show.  I really got into curling.  Stay tuned for us watching curling.  But here's the update.  The Olympics ended and I never saw curling again.  I forgot about it, could give a shit about it, and now I'm going to be all about curling. 
[00:59:00]  I really thought Bob Costas would make some kind of moment with curling and I would watch again, but I haven't watched it in four years.  You think they got new gadgets?  New sweepers?  Ah, probably not.  New technology for the ice?  Very traditional game there.  Ah, they got something going on.  Those, uh...  Stones.  We knew all the technology, remember?  The stones that they throw?  Um, it's still just a piece of rock, right?  It's just shuffleboard.  A hunk of rock. 
[00:59:30]  Shuffleboard on ice.  Yeah.  But then the guy sweeps to make it more slippery.  Or then doesn't sweep to make it stop quicker.  They all sweep exactly the same, but for some reason that guy sweeps better than that guy.  You figure it out.  It's all about how hard you're pushing and how much you're, how fast.  Come on.  You shove a little, like, ice shavings in front of the rock.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Slow it down a little bit.  If it's speeding up too fast.  Oh, it's an exciting game. 
[01:00:00]  All I want to do is watch, uh, Olympic hockey.  It's all about Olympic...  Oh my god, Olympic hockey rules.  It really does, Ant.  A little curling, a little Olympic hockey, and, uh, the downhill.  Not the slalom.  Maybe the giant slalom, but that downhill is insane too.  My favorite, that fucking, you know, the same place they got that clip, The Agony of Defeat, from.  Oh, the ski jump.  The big ski jump.  The big motherfucker ski jump. 
[01:00:30]  Because those guys now haven't figured out where they're just flying.  That's easy, though.  I do that on the Wii all the time.  Oh, you do?  On the Wii?  That's so easy.  I could, I could ski jump.  I've proven it on the Wii.  Look at them.  They're still...  They're turning it.  Remember that?  They actually make it turn a little bit, and...  Yeah, do they?  Oh, oh, look at that.  We're looking at, like, the best of curling on YouTube or something.  This is some of the best curling.  Any curling fights?  Ever have any bench-clearing brawls on curling? 
[01:01:00]  They just go out with the sweepers?  And do the brooms ever hit?  I don't know.  Look at this.  Look at this ridiculous...  Look at that lag he's got there.  That's nice.  Would you play this, though, Ant?  Now the broom is coming.  If there were beers involved?  It's too cold.  Nah, it's indoors.  Yeah, it's cold.  It's on ice.  Calm down.  I'm not...  Oh, right.  What's wrong with you?  I thought Gallagher was here for a second.  I had to yell.  Ah, see?  See, I told you.  Richard in North Carolina.  Richard! 
[01:01:30]  Good morning, boys.  Good morning, Richard.  How are we doing?  Pretty good.  We're talking about the Olympics.  Yeah, you're talking about they need some advancements in curling.  I heard they're coming out with an eye stone for this time.  You get all excited when you push it off, and then it collapses before it even gets to the target.  Chip, shut up.  Yeah, it's bad enough.  Don't laugh at that.  What the fuck is that?  The eye stone.  Is he making fun of the eye phone?  The eye phone.  He's making fun of the eye phone, but...  All right. 
[01:02:00]  ...called it the eye stone.  Ugh.  It's just light.  Enough.  Is that a Leroy Neiman painting?  It did look like Leroy Neiman.  Enough about Leroy Neiman.  He's very talented with his sports paintings.  Is he?  Rocky.  Rocky.  You know, I tried curling in high school, but I couldn't get curling straight.  Whoa.  Goddamn.  You know, I do at some point want to talk quickly about Senator Harry Reid. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, yeah.  And his comments, which got much more publicity and controversy than it should have.  And the Republicans are just, like, stupid for even asking this guy to step down.  They pull out their Republican National Committee guy, that Michael Steele, who's the only black Republican ever, and ask him to step down because of his comments.  His comments, first of all, they were in private. 
[01:03:00]  And secondly, it was true.  How could you argue the fact?  Because you're not supposed to think that way.  Well, you know what?  That's the thought police, man.  Yeah.  And I won't be part of it, man.  No, I think the Republicans are right, though.  I disagree with you.  I think they should be.  Yes.  Because it always happens in the reverse.  And just to see a liberal stick his foot in his mouth racially like that is fun to watch.  He didn't stick his foot in his mouth. 
[01:03:30]  The guy, it was a private conversation.  Walk us through it, Ant.  And, well...  What was the private conversation?  Before the election, Harry Reid was talking about Obama, candidate Obama.  And he said, Obama is light-skinned and speaks with no Negro dialect unless he wanted to have one.  That's the whole controversy of it. 
[01:04:00]  He is light-skinned.  Yes.  And he doesn't speak with a Negro dialect.  Now, that's the thing.  It's like Negro dialect.  First of all, the word is offensive.  Meanwhile, it's the N in NAACP.  I mean...  Or colored.  No, national is the N.  Man.  Sorry.  I meant colored.  Negro.  Ah.  CP.  Negro.  No.  No.  What I meant to say, I'm sorry.  Negro is used in the census. 
[01:04:30]  That's the story I read.  Right, right.  And they were all up in arms about that.  Is that word becoming a bad word now?  Yeah, of course it is.  I'm getting confused.  Of course it is.  Where's my scorecard?  I can't figure this shit out anymore.  Why?  Yeah.  I mean, stop with your fake outrage about semantics.  So what's the Negro?  You already got the N-word called the N-word.  You're not allowed to say there's an actual Negro dialect out there?  Negro dialect.  It's all over pop culture.  People are so outraged at the thought that you can, what? 
[01:05:00]  Black people speak a certain way?  You're saying that there's differences.  Each race.  Racist Gallagher pointed it out on Friday.  Of course he did.  He was telling Patrice.  Birthday and birthday.  A bathroom.  Racist Gallagher.  And teeth.  I'm just saying that certain cultures and certain ethnic backgrounds have certain ways of speaking.  Not everybody.  I'm not saying everyone.  I'm just saying certain people in certain ethnic backgrounds do. 
[01:05:30]  Is it a majority, though?  The majority of Negroes.  Yes.  The majority of the colored people.  Yeah.  So they have a Negro dialect.  As far as I have seen in my life experience, which has been, you know, more than just a few years, I say yes.  There is a dialect that you can tell when you hear that it is a black person. 
[01:06:00]  Now, sometimes you'll get what are called Wiggers that are white people that try to act like black people, and they put on that dialect.  Can I answer the question, too?  Yes, sir.  I also say yes.  Yeah, of course.  I also say yes to that question.  Jimmy?  What was the question?  A majority, the majority of Negroes, because that's what was said here, do they have a Negro dialect?  Yeah, they have what Rita's talking about, yes.  Of course.  So why, speaking about Obama, saying he is light-skinned and speaks with no Negro dialect, 
[01:06:30]  and that was a compliment saying this is a black president that can be elected because America isn't ready for a president that is very dark-skinned and has a Negro dialect.  But that shows you, I think it is, it is kind of a shitty thing to say, but I don't think he's a racist at all.  Why would it be a shitty thing to say?  Because if you're saying it as a fact, like... 
[01:07:00]  He does have an amazing record, too, about African-American causes and bills and things like that.  Like, absolutely, he's not a racist.  The guy shouldn't have to leave.  But it shows to me, that is exactly the thinking.  That's how he feels.  Like, look at the fucking paternalism in that.  That's how those ultra-liberals feel about blacks.  Like, he was one of the...  I guarantee he's one of those type of guys who would criticize you if you admitted having a racial thought or a racist thought. 
[01:07:30]  And yet, that is exactly how he looks at blacks.  Well, he has no Negro dialect.  And even though he might have just been talking about how the country will vote, in which case he's right,  that does show you exactly the thinking.  That's why I despise them.  Because they...  I believe he was also one of the guys...  Well, Trent Lott.  Yeah.  Trent Lott got forced out when he was talking about comments about the 1948 segregationist campaign.  Right.  When he was talking about Strom Thurmond. 
[01:08:00]  And he said, if Strom Thurmond won the race, we wouldn't have had all these problems over all these years.  See, that's a little more...  But I think he was just praising Strom Thurmond in his speech.  He was just trying to say Strom Thurmond would have been a strong leader.  I don't think he was getting into the specifics of it.  I don't think...  He didn't mean it like that, like these goddamn blacks.  That's not how Trent Lott meant it.  But he still had to step down.  Yeah, he did.  Because the fucking left targeted him. 
[01:08:30]  And fucking Sharpton's a scumbag.  Like, he says, oh, we shouldn't allow these comments to distract from getting healthcare.  It all...  You can say anything you want if you're on the side of the people who you're offending.  That's all...  Yeah, yeah, right.  You can criticize...  You can say whatever you want if you're a Republican and you're on the side of the Republicans and they won't come after you as hard.  Same with the liberals.  It's fucking sickening.  I just think it's ridiculous, though, that they get, you know, the black guy in the Republicans, Michael Steele, and have him ask for Harry Reid to step down for saying something that just, you know, it's nothing. 
[01:09:00]  It's, first of all, yes, it's true.  Well, let's play this clip here.  Top Republicans are calling for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to step down.  Democrats feel that they can say these things and they can apologize when it comes from the mouths of their own.  But if it comes from anyone else, it's racism.  The Nevada Democrat is in political hot water for racial comments he made about President Obama during the campaign. 
[01:09:30]  The new book Game Change reports that Reid declared the country would embrace a light-skinned African-American with no Negro dialect unless he wanted to have one.  Reid has apologized for his poor choice of words and for offending any and all Americans, especially African-Americans.  How do you not want that douchebag in hot water?  Stop it.  It's going to come to a point where we're not going to be able to speak our minds.  Because we're already there.  We're there.  We're there.  We're there.  True.  And getting worse.  You're right, actually.  And getting worse every day. 
[01:10:00]  That is an accurate statement.  It's accurate.  That's how America thinks as a whole.  If you're talking about a guy running for president and he's a black guy, America is more apt to vote for a guy like Barack Obama than they would be a guy like Clubber Lang.  Yes.  You know, it's just the way it is.  That is the truth being spoken right there.  But they're also more likely to vote for a guy like Bush or Cheney or Dukakis than they are... 
[01:10:30]  Old white guy, basically.  Insert white...  Sid Vicious.  It's almost like...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The thing is like...  Oh, I got where you're going.  It's like they don't look at white candidates the same way.  Like, well, they'll vote for him.  His skin color is the right tone.  And he doesn't speak like a...  And then insert white stereotype there.  That's where, I guess, the issue comes in.  Here's part two of the story.  The book hasn't even been released yet, and President Obama has already declared the matter closed. 
[01:11:00]  The president called Reid's comments unfortunate, but accepted his apology.  Why are they unfortunate?  That's just how this country...  Obama knows, too, that's why he was elected.  That's how this country thinks as a whole.  Did Obama have the same comments that I missed, by the way?  Uh, no.  Of course not.  And, by the way, I heard 60 Minutes did a story on this book.  And, uh, did they avoid the...  I'm not going to attack them, because I might be wrong.  Did they avoid this particular issue in the book? 
[01:11:30]  Hmm.  I don't know.  For sure.  It's amazing how they attacked Palin and all the conservatives.  Any verbal misstep by them, they crucified them for.  And I believe there's a quote, too, from Bill Clinton that says, uh,  it wasn't long ago this guy would have been getting us coffee.  Yeah, no shit.  It's unfortunate, but accepted his apology.  Republicans are crying foul, saying Reid should be treated the same as former majority leader Trent Lott. 
[01:12:00]  The Republican was ousted in 2002 from Senate leadership positions after he said the nation would have been better off if segregationist Strom Thurmond had won his presidential bid in 1948.  But I guarantee you, he didn't say segregationist.  I'll bet you Trent Lott didn't say segregationist.  They're saying it.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, if he was praising, uh, Strom Thurmond, and he said, if things would have been better if you won, what are you supposed to say to a guy at a dinner when you're praising him? 
[01:12:30]  Yeah, well, he was running in 48 as a segregationist campaign.  So then he said, if he won in 48, we wouldn't have to deal with all these problems that we have now.  But that's a poor choice of words.  That's not thinking through.  That's a poor choice of words.  That's going, you know what, I was trying to praise the guy, and I wasn't thinking, like, wow, that's the implication I'm giving.  Fucked up.  That's all, but he had to leave.  Yeah.  So Harry Reid says something which is condescending, completely fucking, uh, racially shitty. 
[01:13:00]  And it is a racially shitty thing.  And no consequences at all for him.  I'm reading stuff that says, like, Ant, I usually agree with you, but I don't on this, because, uh, some of these are the same liberal assholes that went after Imus and stuff.  I don't get, I really don't want you to get my point twisted here.  I'm not saying that there isn't that double standard.  I'm just saying, fuck the parties, fuck Republican, Democrat, or anything.  I don't believe what he said merits being fired or even being criticized. 
[01:13:30]  I don't think so.  Oh, yeah, as a payback to the liberals, fine.  Then fucking throw his ass out of there.  But, but as just a guy speaking his mind on, on a campaign, the guy is, is accurate.  And what's the problem?  Because it's not a payback.  It's consistency in penalizing people for the use of certain language.  Like, for instance, the liberals will eventually get the point when their own starts suffering. 
[01:14:00]  And when they start getting fucked and ousted for little verbal missteps that have anything to do with race or ethnicity, when they start getting their heads lopped off for it politically, then maybe they won't attack other people, which, of course, filters down to radio guys and comedians.  Maybe they won't be as self-righteous if that scumbag Sharpton would go after them as hard.  Or if there was the same penalty for them.  But there's no penalty for them.  None for racial discussions. 
[01:14:30]  They can say what they want.  That's a pretty good point right there.  Wow.  I don't know where to get.  Should we just start from the top?  Yes.  All right.  Everyone's always.  I said yes, I guess it's my decision.  Mike in Pennsylvania.  Mike?  He's always funny.  Mike, hey.  I watched 60 Minutes last night, and they were all over Palin for her taking the debate where she called Biden, O'Biden.  They didn't even mention Reid.  Of course they didn't.  But the media's not biased, right? 
[01:15:00]  We're all just paranoid.  We're a bunch of paranoid white guys.  The media's not biased at all.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fuck 60 Minutes.  Let's go to Butch in Jersey.  Butch.  What's up, gentlemen?  I want to know what Andy Rooney was talking about last night.  Can we find out?  Do you ever notice when one of them looks at your woman, you don't make eye contact with them?  Do you ever notice how good they are in sports?  Either that or he just wouldn't talk about it like important issues.  And he talks about watch fobs.  Why don't anyone have watch fobs anymore? 
[01:15:30]  The watch fob.  What is a watch fob?  I need to know.  It's that little thing that goes through your button for your pocket watch.  It's called a fob?  It's a watch fob.  I had no idea.  And I only know that because of a Honeymooners episode where Ralph was trying to sew up the chicken after he stuffed it.  And he sewed it to his shirt.  And Norton goes, hey, Ralph, what do you got there?  A new watch fob?  That fucking cracked me up.  Oh, fuck.  Butch, go ahead.  Hey, absolutely.  You said earlier that the conversation was in private. 
[01:16:00]  I just saw the authors on the TV and they both said that everybody that gave an interview knew that nothing was off the record.  So he made that comment.  He knew that it was on the record.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, well, okay.  But still, even better.  Then it wasn't in private.  Then he, that's how he felt?  That's what he said?  Fuck it.  Even, by the way, even if it wasn't private.  You know who else was having a private conversation?  Alec Baldwin.  Dog the Bounty Hunter had a private conversation with his son that was recorded and released. 
[01:16:30]  So, again, the privacy of these people isn't respected.  Why should Harry Reid?  It doesn't matter.  We all have to be brainwashed.  Hitler and Goebbels.  It's the same way.  A lot of private conversations.  I'm sure.  Let's say hi to Google.  Google.  Shut up, Jim.  Google.  Asshole.  Aunt Jim.  I can't think of a good computer chat program.  Through Google.  Oh, yuck.  Let's say hi to Fontaine.  A regular to the O&A show.  What's up, Fontaine?  Hi, Negro. 
[01:17:00]  Hey, guys.  What's up, man?  Are you a Negro?  Go ahead.  Of course.  I know.  Well, you can't say Negro, but what is that college fund?  You can't say colored, but what's the C stand for in NAACP?  Well, it is the United Negro College Fund.  Ah, that's what I meant.  Oh, boy.  I got confused.  That would have worked.  Yeah.  Give me what the coal in the D.  Ah, yeah.  It was freezing in Dallas.  Have a good show, bud.  Take care, buddy.  Yeah, one of the coldest days in 70 years, something like that.  Pete in Florida.  Pete.  Yeah, what about Ebonics? 
[01:17:30]  They had that all crazy a couple years ago.  Even one of the...  I'm not even...  Dude, I know what you mean, like, with Ebonics, but I'm not even talking about, like, fucking  wacky words and shit like that.  I'm just talking about a certain sound to a voice.  We want to be treated the same, but we want to be different.  That's how it is.  And it's just crazy.  Punching out.  Here's the rule with racial discussions, and this is the absolute rule. 
[01:18:00]  If you're black or a white liberal, you can say whatever you want, and it's either A, agreed  with, or B, forgiven.  If you are conservative or a white guy who just doesn't march in that line, you had better  watch your fucking step when discussing race.  Scarlet R will be on your sweater.  It is that inconsistent.  Is that good?  Yes.  That means racist.  It means Rydell High.  Rydell High, like in Greece.  Nice.  I want an R.  Todd in Pittsburgh.  Todd. 
[01:18:30]  What's up, fellas?  What's up?  First of all, Jim, you've got to come to Pittsburgh sooner or later.  I am, actually.  I just don't know whether I am.  Why?  So he could fuck Crosby?  Fuck Crosby!  Who's Crosby?  How dare you?  He knows.  I got to disagree with you guys about there's a black dialect.  I think it's just people who speak well and people who talk like assholes.  Like boys in the hood being spelled with a Z when they spell with a Z?  Of course it's a black dialect.  You're getting it mixed up.  There's not.  There's people who speak like dipshits and there's people who speak well. 
[01:19:00]  I'm not talking about somebody that's going around using Ebonics and words like that.  I'm saying you could sit there and read the fucking Constitution and have a white guy read it and a black guy read it and listen to recordings.  They can't read it.  See, I can't even have a serious conversation.  And in a lot of circumstances, you will know which is which because of a dialect.  There is a certain way that certain ethnic backgrounds speak. 
[01:19:30]  Italians are the same way.  It has nothing to do with the upbringing or anything.  It's just that Irish, perhaps fucking...  You Italians are a nightmare.  You just talk about pasta dishes all the time.  Yes, exactly.  You ever hear a fucking Italian guy from, like, Brooklyn talking?  And you know it's an Italian guy from Brooklyn.  Sure.  He's throwing the dialect.  There's a dialect. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  And with black people, it doesn't matter what they're saying.  They could be saying the most intelligent thing.  I'm not saying they're talking like a thug or a gangster, but there is an inflection in the voice.  There is certain...  I don't even know how to describe it, but you just know it when you hear it.  Speaking of the Negro dialect, remember the KFC thing we did last...  I don't know if it was KFC, the chicken news clip we did?  Remember the chicken news clip where all the people...  They were upset about the... 
[01:20:30]  They were very upset that...  The Popeye's chicken was not available.  Well, someone turned me on to a video last night.  Oh, it was almost perfect.  Where they took the news report where it was black person after black person very, very upset that there was no more free chicken.  Really?  And they spliced in a white guy.  Oh, really?  Getting the news.  If Danny can find it, it's...  Oh, I just miss being a great, great comedy clip.  Where the white guy's like, oh, there's no...  Oh, all right, well...  All right, I guess I'll just get pizza for the family tonight. 
[01:21:00]  Go somewhere else.  No real big deal.  And then they go back to everybody else just losing their minds.  I don't know where you're going to find it, Danny.  I mean, I should maybe, like, write some of this shit down before we go live with it.  But if you can find it.  Let me go to Tom in Chicago.  Tom.  Fuck the Blues Brothers!  You're out, Tom.  Maybe I can help.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, Tom.  Sorry, Tom.  Hey, you know, this guy shouldn't lose his job over what he said.  It is the...  Even though they did go after Imus... 
[01:21:30]  And Trent Lott.  Yeah, we need to go after...  We need to be bigger than that.  Otherwise, it's basically just the pod calling the kettle black.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Ooh.  Well, they're not going to be bigger than that, sir.  And the left is not going to stop criticizing people for saying things that are either honest  racially or inappropriate racially.  So they should start having to eat the same shit they're feeding everybody else.  Yeah.  Um, what do you think, Dan?  You heard it.  It just... 
[01:22:00]  It just misses.  Just at least get the girl before him.  Yeah.  Everyone knows the clip.  The setup, basically, is the Popeye's thing where they ran out of chicken.  The news went there and interviewed all black people.  Yeah.  We made that observation.  All black people really pissed off.  They couldn't get their bucket in.  And someone took the footage and kind of spliced in their own white guy.  One white guy.  All right, so check this out.  One woman yelled back at the machine.  People have kids and they're trying to feed for the special. 
[01:22:30]  And you mean to tell me that we can't feed our kids?  Because I didn't order enough chicken.  I knew y'all was having this special almost two months ago.  And that's wrong.  But no one was listening.  The Popeye's on Lake Avenue was closed by dinner time.  Are you kidding me?  I think that's bad because I'm sure I'm hungry.  No chicken.  No chicken?  They just had a chicken.  I said, I'm calling customer service now to see where there's another Popeye's at.  Yeah, they seem to be out of chicken today.  So I'll just pick up a pizza. 
[01:23:00]  It's no big deal.  Other locations ran out.  Hi.  They just popped him in there.  That's pretty good.  No big deal.  I'll just pick up a pizza.  No big deal.  Like I said, they almost, almost hit a home run with that.  We found out, we're going to find out what Andy Rooney was talking about, Jimmy.  Bear in Maryland.  Bear?  Oh.  And Amy.  Good morning, fellas. 
[01:23:30]  Good morning, sir.  Yeah, Andy Rooney last night was talking about pretty much one of your other favorite subjects.  Hoarding.  Not being able to throw shit away.  I've got two computers in my office that don't work.  And one on the desk that's broken.  But I can't seem to throw them away.  Yeah.  This is 60 minutes.  I don't want people to find the hard drives and all the kiddie porn.  I've been collecting my poopies since 1937.  I would love to think that Andy Rooney has jars and jars of urine. 
[01:24:00]  Jars of urine.  Just collecting all this urine.  All over CBS.  Those are lit, Jesus.  This guy thinks I'm a racist?  He's tired of my racist comments.  Anthony's subconscious.  You're on the phone.  You know what?  I don't...  Is he for real?  A lot of times I don't agree with Anthony.  But today I'm right there with him.  Right there with him.  Jake, what's your problem today, buddy?  Hey there, Jake.  Dude.  Morning, boys. 
[01:24:30]  Hey, man.  Anthony, you're just full of shit, dude.  You're just a big racist.  Now, why?  You've got to admit it.  Based on what I said about this situation, why?  Why?  Yeah.  Well, take, for instance, this Saturday at the Borgata.  Do you think there's going to be any blacks in the audience?  You know something?  I knew when I saw it.  You're an ass.  You know, we're all going down there for Jimmy's shows, too.  Yes.  Saturday is sold out.  Friday, there might be 40 tickets left.  That's it. 
[01:25:00]  Friday might be totally clean, too, yeah.  We're going to have a party down at the Borgata.  Join us, man.  Check Friday's show, but Saturday's totally sold.  All right, Jake.  I'll see you Saturday.  All right, buddy.  See you, Jake.  Jake, you want to keep going with this?  Anthony's right.  There is a complete difference in the way they speak.  I'm a teacher.  Let's see what a teacher has to say.  Megan.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Have you ever had sex with a student?  No, I have not.  Have you thought about having sex with any of your students before?  Just a thought.  This is only my first year, though. 
[01:25:30]  Huh?  It's only my first year.  Only her first year.  She's got time.  Okay, go ahead.  Yeah, I'm an English teacher in Mississippi, and there's a complete difference in the way  that white people here speak and the way that white people speak.  Why is that?  Well, I don't know who I did.  I'm an English teacher, and I'm trying to figure it out myself.  I just know that when I call parents to tell them, you know, that their kid's doing something  wrong in class, that their grades are failing, they hang up on me immediately or ask, who  is this?  Because my voice sounds completely different than what they're used to having called their  house. 
[01:26:00]  But anyway, I just wanted to let you know from my perspective, yeah, they sound different.  Interesting.  All right, and then let's go to another broad.  Kate in Cincinnati.  Kate.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I am a speech therapist, and when we assess children, we have exceptions for black dialects,  like dialects from different areas, like people from Boston.  They don't have their R's.  We don't hold that against them because they speak differently.  It's something that you just don't hold against them.  You have to understand that they have a different dialect, and that's all it. 
[01:26:30]  Anthony, I totally agree with you.  It's a dialect.  It's not like they speak worse than the standard norms.  I just don't understand why it's such an evil thing to say.  I don't get why it's this evil, racist thing to even bring it up.  Because a lot of times in criminal courts, you'll get somebody, a witness that says, well,  I heard someone speaking, and they sounded black, and man, the other side just gets on them. 
[01:27:00]  What do you mean?  What are you talking about?  Describe what you mean.  And it's very hard to describe, but you know the difference, and it makes it.  They paint the person out to be a racist for even bringing it up.  For noticing that.  Yeah.  We pretend we don't know.  It's like, it's hard to...  Well, African-Americans don't have...  Sorry.  Are you guys there?  Yes, we are, Miss.  Go ahead.  We're listening to Kate's radio show.  You are right, though.  Sorry.  Go ahead, Kate's radio show.  Go ahead, Kate.  Some of their main differences...  Could you go to us next, please?  We're on the phone on hold. 
[01:27:30]  Yes, go ahead, Kate.  Go ahead, Kate.  Yeah?  Are you...  I was just saying that they don't use...  Yes, you were just saying.  We were just listening.  Yeah, Kate.  See how that hurts?  Go ahead.  Kate, finish your thought.  She's gone.  Oh, she'll leave.  Oh, Christ.  Oh, poor girl.  Poor Kate.  Poor Kate.  Poor girl.  Let's go to a black guy.  Hello, black guy.  Just says Coop.  Black guy.  Hi, black guy.  Yes, I'm a black guy.  That's what it says on the phone.  I'm sorry. 
[01:28:00]  That means just a black guy.  I'm sorry, black guy.  What up, Coop?  All right, white guys.  Hi, Jimmy.  Hi, Coop.  And two white guys.  That's Jimmy.  Fucking...  Honestly, what's that?  I honestly don't have no fucking opinion on this whole Harry Reid shit.  My whole thing is I hate the idea that white people in general, whether you're conservative  or liberal, talk about black people like for some way, like where's your responsibility  or something.  Like you have to tread lightly.  Like you're talking about...  Like you're talking around a bunch of fucking retarded children. 
[01:28:30]  Yes.  I hate...  That's the shit that got me mad right now.  Yeah, I can't stand that myself.  I don't give a fuck about any racist, stupid racist comment where any white man says it  is what it is.  You're going to say dumb shit to the fucker in the time.  It don't matter to me.  You don't like the paternalism.  I hate it.  That's what drives me crazy.  The idea that for fucking, oh, it's our job to deal with, take care of them and make  sure...  Yeah, you need to be coddled.  Make sure they get jobs.  Make sure they do this and this and that. 
[01:29:00]  And this is one of the reasons I get to tell my own peoples because we look at this shit  and accept it and not know how to...  Like we can't take care of ourselves.  One...  I had this discussion the other day with another white Republican.  And my point is this.  I'm...  I'll be honest.  I'm...  According to the definition of the word, I'm a racist.  I...  Fuck it.  I admit it.  I believe in separation of races because people should take care of themselves.  No matter what...  I like the way you think.  No man is going to feed my family, so why the fuck should it be any different for a 
[01:29:30]  race?  And in the United States, this country is the only country in the world where one race  is propping up the other race.  You know what I'm saying?  And that's my problem.  And it seems like nobody wants to fucking admit that or talk to it because if somebody,  a white guy, say what I'm saying right now, I would be totally 100% in agreement with  him.  But then again, you're going to get a bunch of other faggot liberal cunts talking about  you shouldn't have said that.  You can't say that.  You can't.  That's racist.  Da-da-da-da-da.  And now you got a bunch of confused-ass black people looking at him like, hey, that's right. 
[01:30:00]  He is racist.  You know what it is?  It's white people trying to hide how they really feel.  That's all political correctness is.  It's like they're not afraid of being rude.  They're afraid that if they say a certain thing, it's going to be a window that exposes  them to how fucking paternalistic they really feel, how much smarter and more intellectually  advanced they really feel.  So their whole obsession with speech is a way to protect themselves from slipping and 
[01:30:30]  being exposed as the way they really feel, which is holier than thou and smarter than  thou and better than thou.  It's irritating.  It's just a bunch of horse shit.  Just be fucking honest.  If somebody says they hate me, I'd rather just be like, okay, I fucking hate you.  All right, then I'm not going to fuck with you.  I'm going to do me over here.  You stay there and do the fucking, don't smile on my face and act like you fucking like  me.  Now I'm confused and thinking, what happened when you stabbed me in the back?  Now I'm looking at you like, oh, I thought you liked me.  Don't stop it.  And I want to be able to not like a black guy because he's an asshole. 
[01:31:00]  Why can't I do that?  You know, it's all, it just, all of a sudden it's got to be racist.  And how come, the problem is, Coop, there's not enough black guys that say that.  There's not enough black guys that go, enough with the paternalism, stop it.  Because like, again, I know Sharpton, black people don't like Sharpton.  The majority of black people think Sharpton's a jizz bag.  I just think he's an opportunist.  I'm sure he is.  He's not a dummy.  I mean, he's just, he is an opportunist.  That's all I think he cares about is just pockets.  But what a fraud this guy is.  Like to criticize, you know, again, I'm sure any other guy that says it. 
[01:31:30]  And yet when Jesse Jackson slips into a Fox microphone and says, Obama's talking down  to niggas, I'd like to cut his balls off.  Not a fucking word.  He protects him.  He protects Harry Reid.  Sharpton's a piece of shit.  I'm not breaking ground by saying that.  The Jesse Jackson statement's way worse than what Harry Reid has.  Also a private statement, not meant to be heard by the public.  There you go.  But it has come to the point where, like, since the inception of this country, black  people have been this country's number one cash crop. 
[01:32:00]  Even to this day, you got a bunch of people that pretty much exploit the fucking ignorance  of black people for their own pockets.  Jesse Jackson's one of them.  Reverend Al is one of them.  A bunch of liberal white assholes is a lot of them.  The one thing, I don't vote on none of them lines.  I don't deal with politics because, personally, like I said, I'm a separatist.  That's white shit.  Y'all deal with Democrats and Republicans and presidents and shit like that.  That's what white people do.  That's what y'all fucking do.  You know what I'm saying?  I stay away from that shit.  I mean, I'm not white. 
[01:32:30]  I'm a black man.  As a black man, I should do my own thing.  I don't celebrate Christmas.  You know why?  Because Christmas is a white man's holiday.  There's no fucking snow in Africa.  So I don't deal with that.  Jerusalem either, or Bethlehem either.  All kind of started.  I don't deal with none of that shit.  And that's the problem that fucking we have is this afraid to talk to each other and be honest.  No matter how upset it may get you, I mean, the only way a relationship strives is when two people are honest with each other.  And if this country wants to be fucking, make it this whole pinnacle of the world that it claims to be, 
[01:33:00]  then let's have this honest dialogue instead of just living in a society of,  white power over white, non-white powerlessness.  God damn.  You know what this fucking...  Excuse me?  Coop's great.  I know.  I'm agreeing with you.  And I cannot wait to see you face-to-face during the race war.  You should line up with Coop on the line there, Ant.  You line up against Coop. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah, go ahead, sir.  The race war started 500 years ago when you went into Africa and took us away from our people.  Wow, I'm that old?  That's when the race war started.  Jesus.  Jesus, I'm an old guy, 500 years old.  We're just trying to catch up.  Excuse me?  I said I'm pretty old then if I went there 500 years ago.  I met your people.  How about we all just get over that whole thing and move on?  My people are laying cement in Italy somewhere.  I love how white people say just get over that, but that's right.  How about we all just get over it?  That shit is the reason for the madness today.  Let's call it a wash.  That shit that happened that long ago is the reason why motherfucking cunts like Paris Hilton and all these no-talent motherfuckers are so respected and revered in a world in a society in which they didn't do nothing. 
[01:34:00]  It's a slavery?  You can be in a white society for yourselves.  That's about privilege, though.  It's like she's a privileged heiress.  There's a part of it that we like seeing.  And she was able to get that because of what happened 500 years ago.  It didn't just happen out of a vacuum.  Fucking this country didn't just the white privilege and all this other shit in this country didn't happen out of a vacuum. 
[01:34:30]  It wasn't given to you.  You fucking decided you took it and you destroyed other races that do it.  I'm not being offensive.  I'm just talking about history.  Pick up a fucking history book.  Who tells you that?  We were the better, so we kicked ass.  Your guns were the better.  You fucking created your guns.  We got better.  Your guns created the power.  We got better guns.  Ha ha.  No, you created your guns.  We had the wheel.  Can I say something about your guns real quick since you're so proud of your guns?  Yes.  Yes, sir.  Technology. 
[01:35:00]  Let me tell you something.  Technology evolves from where human limitation ends.  Thereby, from what I've come to understand about your guns and white people in general,  because I fucking believe me, I pay a lot of close attention to you motherfuckers.  Yeah.  The fact of the matter is this.  Your guns, it is not talked about that guns are symbolic penises.  Yeah.  I've heard that before.  Yes.  Okay, now let's go with the symbolic penis thing.  First of all, I don't believe the guns themselves.  It's not the fucking cop.  It's the balls that are the fucking representation of what the guns mean. 
[01:35:30]  Because white people on the planet are a global, genetic, recessive minority.  When I say genetic recessive, I mean in terms of skin coloration.  Now, through miscegenation and interracial fucking, the white race could be annihilated  on the planet as far as color goes.  Well, that seems to be the direction we're headed, sir.  When you went out there, excuse me?  That's the direction we're heading in.  Now, when you, like I said, when y'all finally began circumnavigating the globe, your explorers 
[01:36:00]  started going out there and looking around the world.  Yeah, that's what we did.  You've seen that there was other people of color out there.  You've seen that the rest of the world was people full of color, and you couldn't deal  with that.  So you created the...  No, I think it's...  Wow, that's a lot of cool land with resources.  I think I'm going to take it.  Yeah, I think it was...  Dude, that was...  War-making guns were simply used against other whites.  They were used against anybody.  Anybody who needed to overpower somebody else used whatever advancements they could use.  That wasn't about seeing people in color. 
[01:36:30]  World War II wasn't about color.  You know what?  I'll give you that then.  I disagree, but I'm going to give you that.  So explain to me the analogy between the gun and the penis.  I think...  I think that it sounds good, but I think that it's almost trivializing the need for power  that a gun expresses.  I don't think it's just about the dick.  I think that's a way of...  I think it's all about the dick.  Nah, because I don't think it's...  It's about completely overtaking power.  It's not about the dick.  What about self-protection?  What about self-protection? 
[01:37:00]  And that's part of your self-protection, to destroy everyone else.  No, no, no, no.  You're one extreme of the other guy over here.  What about a guy that enjoys having a gun, shooting it, and having it...  But you're talking about...  I'm talking about the origin, the necessity to create the gun in the first place.  Because we wanted better ways to kill people.  That's how everything works.  We want to thrive on the planet as a global minority.  Hold on, let me ask you a question.  No.  Wait, Coop, how... 
[01:37:30]  When black tribes...  Hold on.  When tribes would fight...  When tribes would fight in Africa...  When tribes would fight in Africa, many years ago, before white people got there...  How were they fighting?  They were fighting with the technology they had at the time.  So it's like...  But was that about a dick and a racial thing?  If it was a spear or if it was a...  If it was not a racial thing...  Let me say...  Explain something.  You can sit there and say what you say, but there's so much...  There's certain things that y'all do that makes me realize that what I'm saying is correct.  You're not addressing one point at a time.  One point at a time.  When one person is trying to overtake another person, whether it's justified or not, if it's through force, it has nothing to do with the dick. 
[01:38:00]  When you're hunting, tools were originally built to hunt and to survive, and then they began to use against each other.  I mean, you know, all people have done that.  So blacks have done it to each other.  Whites have done it to blacks.  And blacks would do it to whites.  In cases where they could do it.  It's human nature.  It's human nature.  That's not about race.  That's not about race.  Getting a weapon to overtake somebody else and using it is not about a bigger dick.  It's not about that.  It's not about race, then. 
[01:38:30]  Why do you need to demoralize and demean a person because of their color?  I think that was something that started probably for economic reasons.  And then people began to feel like that was their birthright.  And I think that's where a lot of the race came in.  I think when people originally went to Africa and began stealing people and having them shipped here, it was simply economics.  And then it became racial very quickly because the difference was so – it was such an obvious difference.  It was easy to look at somebody who was darker as subhuman because they didn't remind you of yourself. 
[01:39:00]  But I think that's a race really kick in.  I don't really agree with that because prior to going into Africa and taking people as slaves, whites have had relationships with Africans thousands of years before that.  Right.  So you're almost making my point.  Yeah, I understand it.  But I'm saying now it has become to this point where black is ugly.  And if you look at the world over, not even just black people but Indian people, Asian people are fucking making themselves up to look white.  If it wasn't such a racial thing, if color has nothing to do with it, then why is it these people are mutilating themselves this way? 
[01:39:30]  But you're saying like where did it become racial, and I think that's where it became racial because the whites against the – the American Indians were killing each other before white people got here.  That wasn't about race.  People fight for territory or they see as power.  Black tribes are doing it to each other in Africa.  When whites were doing it to blacks, it was so obviously because the race was different.  But you understand what I'm saying?  It's the people have been doing it to each other since time out of mind.  It's all people have ever been done to each other.  It's not always about race, my friend. 
[01:40:00]  Not always about race at all.  You know what?  I'll just quote the great Mr. Greg Hughes and say we just have to agree to disagree.  There it is.  Have a good day, gentlemen.  All right, sir.  Coop's a regular.  I remember him now.  Coop does all right for us.  All right, why don't we take a break?  Have we broken yet or taken one break so far?  One.  When we get back, we got what Blagojevich said about Obama.  He just wants attention.  Blagojevich.  He just wants attention.  It's kind of funny.  And then we got Danny Rooney talking about outdated electronics.  That's what it was about.  And more of your phone calls. 
[01:40:30]  If you want to wait through the break, Clarence in Iowa and a few others, just stay there.  We'll try to get to you next.  O.P. and Anthony.  Hey, guys.  Hi.  Blagojevich.  Need some attention, I think.  Can you see what I want?  I want to ronder your wicked goddamn. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  Fuck.  Rocks.  Love the STP.  Yeah.  Love the Scott Wyland.  Soundgarden get back together.  I know you're a big Soundgarden fan, too, Ant.  Oh, yeah.  I saw Chris Cornell twittering that shit.  Ooh.  He's a good one to follow on Twitter, too.  Is he freaking...  I like following people that travel the world, because they got all sorts of shit that's  going on you can't even relate to.  They can take pictures and Twitter them.  All that crap.  It's just boring. 
[01:41:30]  But Soundgarden getting back together.  That's cool.  I knew it was just a matter of time.  But I also know it's going to be just a temporary thing.  Because Chris Cornell is just...  He's got so much going on.  They can never really...  Huh?  And they can never get together and stay together for any length of time, these bands, anymore.  No, no, no.  It just doesn't work.  Brr, brr, brr.  Wow, look at that.  Scott Wyland.  A little chubby.  It's weird to see him a little chubby.  Is that on Letterman many years ago? 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, this was 1993 doing Wicked Garden on Letterman.  Now he's thin there.  What year is it?  I want to hear the card.  Okay.  I don't know when he steps it up.  And you love.  And you cry. 
[01:42:30]  I want a drink from your name.  I want a drink from your fountain.  I want a drink from your sorrow.  I'm going to burn, burn your life, yeah.  Out of the stains with my hair.  Can you see the side of the sky?  Can you see the side of the sky?  Yeah, that sounds good.  Is he lip syncing?  No.  Oh, no.  Okay.  No.  No, not at all.  He's just blasting out some rock.  It's weird seeing him look chubby.  I mean, not chubby. 
[01:43:00]  I know, because he's usually emaciated.  It's kind of like he's in shape, built a little bit.  He looks normal.  He looks like a normal dude that's on the thin side, and he's easily...  How many pounds lighter, do you think?  20 to 25?  From this to now?  Yeah.  She's probably...  Even more, maybe?  Perhaps.  Perhaps.  All right.  So, you got Rod Blagojevich.  Rod Blagojevich telling Esquire Magazine this. 
[01:43:30]  Former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich says he's blacker than Obama.  In an interview with Esquire Magazine, Blagojevich says he grew up with a tougher life than our  president, and that Obama was elected simply based on hope, and that everything he's saying  is on teleprompter.  Blagojevich insists he was a real person in a political arena dominated by phonies.  He was impeached last year after allegedly trying to sell the president's old U.S. Senate 
[01:44:00]  seat.  Way to go, Blagojevich.  Way to go.  Maybe you should have been on teleprompter, you idiot.  Right.  Fucking God.  And Obama was elected on hope?  Yeah.  But we all know, Anthony, don't we?  Yeah.  Uh, yes.  Don't go home with mope.  Exactly.  She, uh, that is such a hack-like thing to say.  All of his stuff was hack. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, what?  Chip?  What's the matter?  No, no, no, no.  Police.  For the love of God.  Chip?  Police.  Police.  For the love of God, no.  I thought Chip had something to say.  No.  Why would you ask Chip if he has something to say?  Yeah, you ask questions.  The guy got elected.  I thought it was votes.  Oh, I hate Chip.  Chip.  Mr. Chipperson.  There's nowhere to go after that.  I know. 
[01:45:00]  That's the problem.  Oh, I love it.  That's the problem.  There's just nowhere to go.  Uh, fuck the boy.  It's just looking for stupid attention.  Yeah, and it is.  It's just like all that hack stuff.  Oh, I grew up in water.  Blah, blah, blah.  He's a fucker.  All right.  Nothing we haven't heard before.  And you can be black and not have a tough upbringing.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  Right?  He's just trying to get back in the noose.  He just wants people to notice him. 
[01:45:30]  We get it.  You fucked up, Rob.  You got caught.  Fucked up.  He trusted us.  And he's one of those guys, I don't think.  What is he?  What's left for him?  In the...  I'm...  Nothing.  Don't know.  He'll get a gig somewhere, though.  As a reality star?  Some nonsense.  He's an embarrassment.  I mean, he was going to go on that reality show.  It's like, you were a governor.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  I know.  What is it with governors?  They're all shitheads.  They're all shitheads.  They really are stupid.  Spitzer was a tool.  Fucking Patterson's obviously a fucking tool. 
[01:46:00]  Oh, God.  Blagojevich was a tool.  Mark Sanford going to, you know, fly in first class America and go see a stupid fucking mistress.  And where was she?  In Ecuador or South America somewhere?  They're all tools.  Yeah.  I think Patterson wants to raise taxes on cigarettes again.  To pay for health care, was it?  Yeah, for health care.  I don't mind that.  I don't smoke them.  I don't smoke either, so it doesn't bother me.  I'm teasing, of course.  How about candy, too?  Really?  Yeah, absolutely. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah, tax the shit out of it.  Only because it's a direct effect on...  It's not a necessary thing, but people do it.  And it makes you a lot fatter, and it makes you a lot unhealthier, and we have to pay for that.  I don't mind.  You should be able to do it.  Like, you should be able to ride without a helmet if you want to.  But you know what?  Insurance should not have to cover your head injuries.  So if you smoke...  You should just pay more.  Then you should pay more.  Sure, because you're making an unnecessary risk.  I'm not talking about if your family has a history of diabetes or heart disease. 
[01:47:00]  But when you smoke, you're taking an unnecessary risk that is a financial risk for other people.  Here's what I'm curious about, though.  Bisexuality?  Yes.  I'm always a little bi-curious.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  The cigarettes are already taxed, like, up the ass.  Ridiculous amounts of money.  Yeah, what does a pack of cigarettes cost right now?  $163 or something?  No, Chip. 
[01:47:30]  They're very expensive, though.  You can say that again.  I might have smoked mores.  More.  Saint on earth, that woman.  Saint on earth.  At least $11 in New York City.  Wow.  For one pack of cigarettes.  A lot of that's taxes.  A lot of it is taxes.  I want to know, really, really, where is that going?  Just don't even bullshit me and tell me it all goes to health care.  Just stop it.  And whenever they put a sin tax on something, it doesn't go where they say it's going to go. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, alcohol.  You put a big sin tax on it, and then it goes to keeping drunk drivers off the road.  Bullshit.  It goes into some piece of fuck project that some politician gave to one of his buddies.  What a load.  Yeah, it really is a load.  We are fucked.  I really want to.  We really are.  We're just fucked, man.  Wait till you see the states just separating from the union.  Oh, would I love to see some secessions.  Let's go. 
[01:48:30]  Wait till they try to throw that one down our throats.  I can't wait for Texas to just go fuck you.  We are fucked.  We are fucked.  We are fucked.  The tax thing is ridiculous.  Yeah.  What surcharges and sin tax and this tax and that tax.  Yeah, everything.  And then they go, well, we got to raise the taxes on cigarettes to pay for health care.  But then, like Ann said, you don't even know where the fucking money's going.  You know where the money goes.  And then every dime you pay has already been taxed.  And then you can't even spend it without being taxed again. 
[01:49:00]  And then they put it, yeah, a sin tax on something.  And then you try to make a little money off your money by throwing it in a savings account  and they have to tax that.  They tax the shitty interest on you.  How is that legal?  Yeah, they tax the fuck out of your money.  To begin with.  Now you put it in the bank.  And then what little money you got left, you put it in the bank to hopefully grow a little bit.  And then they tax your shitty 2% interest.  Two?  You're getting two?  Well, sometimes.  Is it up to two?  One, no.  Most people are getting what, one? 
[01:49:30]  Probably averages two if you go to one of those long-term accounts.  Yeah, but most people are just doing their local banking and they're not getting anywhere near two.  I got a passbook savings account.  Passbook?  Yeah, I sure do.  You still hand them the book and they stamp it?  Well, deposits.  That's right.  Those never worked for me.  I was in there.  It was like deposit, withdraw, withdraw, withdraw, withdraw.  Deposit, withdraw, withdraw, withdraw.  And then I had no money left in it. 
[01:50:00]  I kind of like the idea of taxing the candy then.  I don't like them taxing anything.  You ever see some fat fucking stunk buying a Snickers bar?  Yeah.  They're hungry.  Good.  Let them eat a...  That's why the Americans are a bunch of fat cunts.  It's because...  Look, going to the airport, all that's open in the morning, Burger King and fucking fatty shit fats.  Fatty shit fats.  Want to eat a fatty shit fats?  I'll have a fat burger with two fucking shit clops on the side.  I'll have a fatty shit fat burger from fatty shit fats. 
[01:50:30]  Please.  Something taxing with extra fat on the side, thank you.  Is really going to help them?  No, I don't care about that.  People should be able to eat what they want.  But it's like, if you're going to indulge like that and not give a fuck, then there should be a financial incentive to eat healthier.  Because people don't give a fuck about their own health.  I don't want to pay for it.  But Jimmy, I'm with you.  When I go to the airport and I can't get a healthy meal, I'm so frustrated.  It's annoying, dude.  I'm so frustrated.  But they'll tell you the only reason they don't have healthy meals is because no one's buying the healthy meals.  If you had a place open that sold healthier meals at that hour, I guarantee you it would sell. 
[01:51:00]  It's so annoying.  You've got to get some kind of fucking muffin from Starbucks.  Ooh, the carrot and celery store in Terminal C.  Blow me.  That sounds delicious.  With the goddamn fucking Cinnabon.  No, I understand that, Amplified.  I mean, there's somewhere in the middle, though, between those two choices.  That they just don't have.  Enough people travel that want to eat healthy where it's like...  Or healthier than what they've got.  You're not saying, all right, I'll take a salad with no dressing. 
[01:51:30]  You just want something in the middle.  You could usually get a chicken wrap or something.  Dude, it's almost impossible.  Most wraps aren't healthy.  Jimmy's right.  Well, I mean, you don't get them with mayo plugged in there.  A little chicken and some lettuce on a tortilla is great.  That means they have to make it fresh.  None of that shit's made fresh.  And they shove the...  It's all pre-made with the mayo and everything in it already.  What?  I get it fresh, motherfucker.  You haven't left your house in three years.  How do you know?  That's right.  Sounds to me like you're fresh. 
[01:52:00]  It's actually pretty funny, Chip.  I know it was.  I say a lot of funny stuff.  You don't.  I'll crack everybody up.  You'll crack everybody up to you.  Let's go to Winston Churchill.  What?  Winnie?  Well, actually, it's Charlie, and he has something that Winston Churchill said.  I was going to say.  Charlie.  Good morning, boy.  Hello, Charlie.  Say it like Winston Churchill, please.  I can't do a Winston Churchill.  Come on.  I'm sorry, Ed.  Try it.  I stink.  I'm sorry. 
[01:52:30]  I stink.  I'm too.  Ed, you might like it.  Winston Churchill said, a nation trying to tax itself into prosperity is like a man standing  in a bucket trying to pick himself up by the handle.  Pretty interesting, I think.  And that's what we're doing.  But that's impossible.  You can't do that.  Exactly.  It's impossible.  That's a great line.  It is a great line.  That fucking Winston Churchill had some great lines.  I wonder if he had a writer.  He didn't have no writer.  Back then, he would just walk up and say things. 
[01:53:00]  This is our finest hour.  It's like, wow, it is.  That's fantastic.  But some schmuck wrote all that shit.  They've always had writers.  I don't know.  I think they always had writers.  I think Winnie came up with some quotes of his own.  Why are you calling him Winnie?  That's what you call him, Winnie.  That's what they called him back then, Winnie.  Yeah.  What?  He's standing in a bucket.  What are you?  It's like, what are you, spackle? 
[01:53:30]  Let's say hi to Steve down the hall.  Steve.  Steve down the hall.  Steve down the hall.  What's up?  Yes.  Yes.  Someone's going to fatty shit, Pat.  Oh.  Wow.  Thanks for calling, Chip.  Oh, boo.  Chip.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  All right, let's see what Amy writes.  Yes, a nation trying to tax itself into prosperity is like drinking cum out of a bucket. 
[01:54:00]  How is that?  Because taxing yourself is delicious.  Never has one person done so little for so many.  Sorry.  Say hi to Stryker.  I may not agree with what you say, but I'll have another piece of cake.  There it is. 
[01:54:30]  There it is.  There it is.  It's like it is.  Speak softly, but carry a big burger.  Hey, I'm trying to get the answer to feedback working.  Does it work?  Four score and one giant logo a go.  The bucket stops here. 
[01:55:00]  Stryker.  There is nothing to fear but hard work.  I'll laugh at that one.  Stryker, what's going on, buddy?  Good morning, boys.  Colorado imposed a $70 road and bridge tax in the form of a fee, and then it came out this  past year, and then now it's come out that they're still $253 million short on our road  and bridge repair budget. 
[01:55:30]  So now they're contemplating, should we make this fee slash tax any higher?  And, of course, our governor is saying this right after he announced it.  Oh, I'm not going to run for re-election.  So now I can get done all of the things I want to do.  I can't.  I wasn't listening.  All I can think of is more Steve lines.  My only regret is I have but one burger to eat for breakfast.  I may not agree with what you say, but I'll die it for your right to say it. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, Stryker was talking about the whole tax thing.  We're just getting taxed up the ass.  Yeah, I mean, I don't know when it's going to stop.  If you talk to these cabbies in New York City, they're pushing them right out of a job.  These guys are like, I can't make money driving a cab anymore. 
[01:56:30]  It used to be a nice little fucking, not even a nice little life, because these guys have  to work 12 hours on, 12 hours off, or they lose their fucking spot.  But most of these guys you talk to, they're like, I can't, I'm not making money anymore  freaking driving a cab.  Yeah.  Because they've surcharged and this charge and that charge and raised how much they have  to pay for the cab for the day and all this shit that they're just not bringing  any money home anymore.  They priced them right out of the business.  So I don't know who the fuck they're going to get to drive these cabs in the next year 
[01:57:00]  or two.  Because it's all going down.  Yeah, they'll be, they'll be somebody.  Who?  Oh.  Who?  They'll find people.  Who?  Ask not what your producer can do for you.  Because it's nothing.  Wow, you just came up on that, I think.  Let's go to Cody in Indiana.  Cody!  Give me liberty or give me surgery. 
[01:57:30]  A diet which will live in infamy.  Steve would be sure.  Give me liberty or give me cum.  Even if you give me liberty, I'd like some cum.  I'll take cum or both, but not just liberty.  Liberty is nice, but not without cum it's not. 
[01:58:00]  Let them eat cock.  Steve from Bayshore.  Let them eat cock.  We got Steve on the phone with something.  Steve.  Holy shit.  Yes.  A cock in the hand is worth two in the bush.  No, those are just sayings.  No, we're going with the big political fucking...  We're going historical quotes.  Yeah. 
[01:58:30]  Political quotes, my friend.  I shall not seek, nor shall I accept another term as your producer.  Steve.  Goddamn Steve from Bayshore.  Let's go to Steve on the line. 
[01:59:00]  A lot of Steve's checking in.  Steve from the moon.  Yes, Steve from the moon.  One small step for man, I'm tired.  One small step for man, one giant cock in my behind.  Let's say hi to Steve calling in.  Steve C, yes, sir.  A 1-8-5-land and the number two value mirror. 
[01:59:30]  I kind of like that one.  As Travis screens the calls, let's say hi to Pete in Jersey.  Actually, it's not Travis, I know.  Hey, what's going on?  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hey, buddy.  What's up, Pete?  Jimmy mentioned something before about smoking cigarettes, and he said that the insurance  companies should charge you more money, and my insurance does.  I pay like an extra $1,000 a year for smoking cigarettes.  I actually just meant, I'm sorry, but I meant the PACs only, not the insurance company. 
[02:00:00]  But yeah, I know, the insurance company does have higher premiums, you're right.  Okay, yeah, I worked in November, I had to fill that out.  All right, that's it.  Thanks, guys.  But why would you admit you're a smoker?  I think if they catch you lying, the insurance doesn't have to cover you at all.  Let's say, look, fuck, I happen to have a cigarette this weekend.  I would not admit that.  They'll get it.  I think you have to, yeah.  They'll get you, man.  Oh, they will.  Let's say hi to Steve.  Steve.  Four score and seven packs a go.  We got Steve C. on the line. 
[02:00:30]  Steve C.  Four courses and seven six dishes a go.  We got Todd.  Todd, what's up?  The Bukowski starts in five minutes.  Let's say hi to Dennis.  Dennis?  Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this closet wall.  Mr. Gorbachev, give me your balls. 
[02:01:00]  A lot of Steve C's checking in.  Steve C.  Give me liberty or give me Mondays off.  That's great.  We got Steve C. checking in.  Steve?  Steve?  Yes.  You're on the line.  Yes.  Yes.  I know Eric Nagel, sir, and you're no Eric Nagel.  All right. 
[02:01:30]  You want?  That's a good quote, but I can't think of anything for it.  Which one?  A house divided against itself cannot stand.  A stomach divided against itself will not stay small.  All right.  A man divided against his own sexuality cannot stand.  However, he can kneel and grab his toes. 
[02:02:00]  Steve C. Check it in.  Steve.  Steve.  Jeff?  No.  Everyone is Steve fucking C for this bit.  Go get Steve.  How hard is this?  Steve, I'm so sorry.  I forgot my name.  I'm so excited.  All right.  All right.  Yeah.  Let's go ahead, Steve C.  Don't fire it until you see the whites of your eyes and your cock is down my throat. 
[02:02:30]  Come on.  All right.  Yeah.  Let's go to Steve C.  Steve C.  Matt.  Beef.  Cheeseburger.  That's pretty good.  You guys want to talk to Steve C today?  Yes.  Is he on?  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Steve C.  Steve.  Hello?  Yeah.  Hi, Steve.  Hi, Steve.  Hey, you won't have Steve Carly to push around anymore.  To err is human. 
[02:03:00]  To be incompetent is divine.  Oh, here's a good one.  Steve C. Check it in.  Steve C.  Hello?  Hi, Steve.  Yes.  I did not have sex with that woman.  I could not.  Ah, shit. 
[02:03:30]  I can't find enough good quotes.  Oh, well.  Steve C. is checking in.  He's got it.  Okay.  Hi, Steve C.  What's up?  Hello, Steve.  Yes.  I had a dream of a cock that tastes like a cheeseburger.  See?  He had a dream, but...  Let's go to Steve C.  Steve C.  Hello?  Hello, Steve C.  Yes, Steve. 
[02:04:00]  I want to probably spell potato.  C-O-C-K.  That's not even a quote.  It's a misstep.  The wheels are falling off.  Steve C., help us out here.  And that's how you executively produce a glory hole.  Yes.  Oof.  Oh.  I'm not going to hire American boys to do what Asian boys should be doing.  We might have to expand the bit with Steve C. on line one. 
[02:04:30]  Steve C.  Yes, is this me?  Am I on the radio?  Yes, Steve C.  Down goes French fries.  Down goes French fries.  No, how about, down goes me.  Down goes me.  Oh, shit.  Oof.  Well.  You want to see what Andy Rooney was up to?  Yes. 
[02:05:00]  And good old Andy Rooney was talking about outdated electronics.  Yes.  60 minutes last night.  This fucking bore.  Still at it.  I'm upset with myself tonight because a lot of the things I bought several years ago that  plug in or run on batteries are obsolete now.  And I can't get myself to throw.  I fell down.  Let's say hi to Steve C.  Steve C.  The only thing we have to fear is vagina.  I thought I might bring the bit back. 
[02:05:30]  Uh, all right, Andy Rooney.  I'm upset with myself tonight because a lot of the things I bought several years ago that  plug in or run on batteries are obsolete now and I can't get myself to throw them away.  Just for example, in the past ten years, I bet I've bought at least eight electric razors.  Of the eight, I only use one now.  The others don't work, but I can't bring myself to throw them away.  I don't mind this one, to be honest with you. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah, so far.  Oh, really?  No.  I relate to it.  I honestly don't.  What?  I don't mind this one yet.  You can't throw old fucking electric razors away?  Now, electronics, it is a pain.  I do kind of save on some level.  What are you going to do with the rest of the electric razors?  I make hats out of them.  You know what?  I taped them together.  It's a heavy hat.  I got a fucking electric razor, a new one, some kind of Norelco thing for Christmas.  I threw my old one away.  It was easy.  Does that work as well as a regular razor? 
[02:06:30]  Well, the best razor right now is with the fucking battery.  That fucking will throw away.  With the blade with the battery?  Holy shit.  Do you use shaving cream or no?  Yeah.  Oh.  A lot of times I dry shave, which is stupid.  Why?  Just because I'm in a hurry.  How fast?  I don't know.  It takes 10 seconds to go.  I don't like it.  Well, I don't let it grow in too long, and then I just dry shave real fast.  I've never.  I hate doing that.  My skin's baby soft smooth, though.  Well, good for you.  That's my nickname. 
[02:07:00]  I like the cream and half the shaving part.  What is it called, though?  It's an easy rub.  You put a little triple A in the handle of the fucking blade.  And then it's disposables on top.  Oh.  And what does that do?  Shakes the blade around a little bit?  Just enough to make it easier to fucking shave away.  It's a great invention.  You don't need any fancy razors anymore.  These things.  So you don't mind the Andy Rooney electronics bit?  So far, no.  Throw them away.  About 40 years ago, I bought a 16-millimeter camera called a Filmo. 
[02:07:30]  I took pictures of the family and even got a couple of pictures on television with it.  It's been in the back of a closet ever since.  Still perfectly good.  Yes, it's in here.  Yes, it's in here.  Yes, it's in here.  Yes, I'm taking pictures.  It bangs into my ankles.  Oh, is he getting trash today? 
[02:08:00]  I'm always black and bluing my ankles on projectors in the closet while I'm trying on undergarments.  Yes, let's go to Steve C.  Steve C.  Yes, I will suck a cock in space before this dickhead is out.  That's a card.  That's a card.  Let's go to Steve C.  One small step for a man.  One deep footprint. 
[02:08:30]  With that, let's say hi to Steve C.  Steve C.  Today, I consider myself the laziest man.  Oh, is that a fucking good one?  All right, let's say hi to Steve C.  God damn it.  Let's say hi to Steve C.  Steve C.  Yes, we have nothing to eat buffet itself. 
[02:09:00]  The what itself?  Buffet.  All right, all right.  That's a good one.  I get it.  Steve C., what's up?  Hello?  Yes.  Yes, hey, Steve C.  Hello?  Yes.  Hi, Steve C.  Hey, read my lips and put some cum on them.  Back to Andy Rooney.  It's still perfectly good, but not many people take pictures with film now. 
[02:09:30]  I'll never use that camera again, but I'll never throw it away either.  Where do you throw a camera anyway?  In everyone's house, there's stuff that will never be used again.  I happen to know there's a Singer sewing machine, two Hoover vacuum cleaners, a mix master, an electric typewriter, two slide projectors, and a black and white tub.  Who cares?  Why does he just go on and on?  There's millions of people watching this shit. 
[02:10:00]  It's not a podcast.  That's not shit for a podcast.  Let's say hi to Steve C.  Steve C.  Hey, this is Steve C.  from the Old North Church.  Yes.  And what do you got, Steve C.?  I just wanted to report that the British are coming.  The British are coming, and it's delicious.  Let's say hi to Steve C. 
[02:10:30]  Steve C.  Yes.  Ask not what you can do for your radio show,  but what your radio show can pay you for your own videos.  I shall return on Tuesday.  Let's say hi to Steve C.  Steve C.  Gentlemen.  Yes.  Yes.  Today is a day that will live on inside of me.  We have Chip on the line. 
[02:11:00]  Chip.  No, it's Steve C.  Hey, I may not agree with what you say,  but you're getting me a whole bunch of cupcakes or something.  I agree with that.  Wow, Chip.  How did you do that?  I can't get her up on me. 
[02:11:30]  Let's say hi to Steve C.  On line one.  Steve C.  Yes.  If you can't stand the heat,  stay in the closet.  No.  Regardless of conditions,  stay in the kitchen.  Let's go back to Andy Rooney. 
[02:12:00]  He can't throw shit away.  Acum cleaners,  a mix master,  an electric typewriter,  two slide projectors,  and a black and white television set  in the basement of our house  that ought to go to the dump.  But they don't go  because I think they're too good for the dump.  Even dumps are obsolete now, of course.  Now they're called recycle centers.  I have four computers here in my office.  Three of them are useless,  and one is broken.  They were invented about 20 minutes ago, 
[02:12:30]  but they're obsolete already.  There they sit,  taking up space.  They'll be there tomorrow,  and a year from tomorrow.  I'll never use one of them again,  but I'll never throw one of them out either.  I'm thinking of starting the new year  by doing something I've never done before,  cleaning out my office.  I'm committing suicide.  Here I am home.  I'll just move all the stuff I have in the closets  down into the basement  with the rest of the junk I put down there.  The basement may be full,  but my closets will be empty 
[02:13:00]  and ready for the new junk.  Jesus.  This is Andy Rooney's  getting close to an about Schmidt moment.  One if by land,  two if by sexual.  What do you mean?  That was a good one.  That's very good.  The British are coming in.  It's delicious.  And it's delicious.  Oh, is he catching a fucking...  He's getting pummeled.  He's catching some fucking right hooks today. 
[02:13:30]  Let's sing out to Steve C.  Steve C.  I'm ready for my cum shot, Mr. DeVille.  Let's go to Steve C.  On line seven.  Steve C.  Mr. Gorbachev,  calm down my throat.  Jesus.  Someone knows how there is.  That was just blatant.  Yeah.  Let's go to Steve C.  Steve C.  Steve C.  How are you, sir?  Yes. 
[02:14:00]  Read my lips.  I'm a faggot.  Let's go to Steve C.  Steve C.  Yes.  A house divided against itself  to be glued back together  with a little cub.  Steve C.  Steve C.  Hello.  Yes.  Hi, Steve.  Big Bean.  I'm homosexual. 
[02:14:30]  Let's go to Steve C.  on line four.  Steve, what do you got?  Glory, glory, hallelujah.  It's fucking wrong.  Let's go to Steve C.  Steve.  One giant step for man  and two large oven mitts  for my canine.  Oh, shit. 
[02:15:00]  Let's say hi to Steve C.  Steve?  Yes, yes.  I am not now,  nor have I ever been a person  who could turn down a cock.  What?  Silly fun.  Huh.  All right.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  We didn't do much  with the Andy Rooney thing. 
[02:15:30]  He's going to have that  about Schmidt moment, though, Ant.  It's almost time.  They're going to fucking  throw all this shit  in a dumpster.  All this stuff  he doesn't want to throw away,  they'll do it for him.  Oh, they certainly will.  The seat with him in it?  They certainly will.  His desk will be  in the Smithsonian, though.  His?  Yeah.  Andy Rooney's?  Yes.  Why?  He's just been there  for so long.  He's such a...  So?  That's what it takes  to make it in, I think.  You like Andy Rooney? 
[02:16:00]  I have mixed feelings about him.  He's really annoying sometimes,  but there is something  about him I like.  I can't just say  the guy sucks.  He doesn't.  He's gotten a little annoying  in his old age,  but I enjoyed him growing up.  I can't deny it.  Can't beat him up?  Nah, I can,  but on this one,  it's like I actually agree with him.  But it's like sometimes  it's just, you know,  it's such nonsense.  All right.  Want to take a break or...  Pretty much just now  redoing the same lines, no? 
[02:16:30]  I don't know.  Are you stealing my line?  No, I don't think so.  Quit stealing my jokes.  Steal my lines.  I may not agree  with what you say,  but, you know,  I ain't dying for nobody.  Yeah, you could just spend  all day trying to find  new quotes.  That's sort of what's  happening right now.  Yeah.  Oh, did we play one of the  dumbest Wheel of Fortune  answers ever?  I don't think we did. 
[02:17:00]  Nice quickie.  Dummy.  What a dummy.  Let me check this out  real fast.  All right, we have a  $3,000 toss-up coming up.  Thing is the category.  Players are ready.  Banner's ready.  And here we go.  Lolita.  Oh, self-potato?  Sorry.  No.  Michael?  Self-corporate.  Yeah, that's it.  All right.  Self-potato. 
[02:17:30]  Self-potato.  No, no, no.  But, you know,  things come...  But I just want to confirm.  You did say self-potato?  Self-potato.  Self-potato.  Look, the letters come up.  It's definitely self.  And it's self-portrait.  It says...  Yeah, self and then P-O.  And she hit it and said  self-potato.  There's a space before  where the T would be not.  And there's a T at the end  of the word.  The T at the end.  It's much too long for potato. 
[02:18:00]  Self-potat.  Self-potato.  What a dumb...  What a choking idiot.  That needs to be a phrase.  Like, if someone doesn't come up  with a meaning for self-potato.  Self-potato.  Yes.  Self-fellatio.  That's what those giant fat people are  who never get out of bed.  They're beyond a couch potato.  They're a self-potato.  They're just dirty  and they have things  growing off them.  You know, he's a self-potato.  That means you're rotting 
[02:18:30]  under one side.  Fucking bedsore pig.  Have another bedsore fatty.  Ah, shit.  Self-potato.  All right.  Hey, did we do the...  We could go to break.  Did we do the top ten things  I've learned from the last  twenty years of TV?  We had the Big Simpsons  special on last night  and Letterman had Homer on  to do a top ten list  on things he's learned  about TV in the last twenty years.  Some people have accused me 
[02:19:00]  of being a producer.  Well, I'll tell you now.  I'm not a producer.  Oh, wait.  I got one.  I got one.  I got one.  I got one.  I got one.  Oh, oh, oh.  I...  I...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm not a producer.  I'm not a producer.  I'm not a producer.  I...  Chip is...  Chip is so fucking annoying.  Let's do this.  Top ten things I've learned  from the last twenty years of TV. 
[02:19:30]  Homer Simpson as we go to break.  Top ten things I've learned  from being on twenty years  of television.  Here we go.  Homer Simpson.  The great Homer Simpson.  Number ten.  Take it away, Homer.  Better to be bald  than have a hairpiece  like Letterman.  That's right.  Number nine.  Do not buy sushi  from the Home Shopping Network.  Number eight.  Thanks to iTunes. 
[02:20:00]  Now you can get  free TV shows  for just  ninety-nine cents.  Number seven now.  Wide-screen televisions  were invented  to accommodate  Keith Olbermann's  enormous head.  Number six  Sadly, Cougar Town is not a show about people getting attacked by giant cats 
[02:20:30]  Number five  Sitting close to the TV is a cheap alternative to a tanning salon  Number four  No one on earth is funnier than Howie Mandel  Thank you, Homer  Thank you very much  Number three  There is no good way to tell your spouse you want to go on wipes work 
[02:21:00]  Yeah, I guess not  Number two  Ever notice all morning weathermen are as fat as a dump truck?  And the number one thing I've learned from the last 20 years of television  Television is not a vast wasteland  It's a cesspool 
[02:21:30]  Over a cesspool, ladies and gentlemen  Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop  The episode of Kenny was very annoyed this morning  We're bringing back one of Kenny's bits where he sings the pop hits for everybody  I believe he's done Lady Gaga  What's the new one that she does there?  Bad Romance  Oh yeah, Bad Romance  I like the New York 
[02:22:00]  Empire State of Mind  Yeah, Empire State of Mind  I think I have that on my iPhone now  Yeah, we can replay that for everybody  I believe you doing that  But he does Bad Romance  And the guys  Kenny sang the whole song  And the guys are only going to use about a minute of it for this bit  And Kenny's very upset that they're not doing the whole four minutes  The whole song  They edited your artistic vision  Yeah, my work cannot be compromised  No one can sit through you singing for four minutes, though  We've got to get right to the hook with you 
[02:22:30]  Well, Titanic was a three-hour movie  What does that mean?  Yeah, but it was probably like ten hours until the editor got to it  Oh, there you go  Yeah  Yeah, that's not the final product  They had to edit it down  I don't know  And then  I don't know  It gets to this point  Good one  Today we had you sing that song by Fireflies, Owl City  Or Owl City by, I don't know 
[02:23:00]  That is the worst song  Don't like that one?  I never even heard of it until somebody brought it to my attention  Probably the hottest pop song in America right now  Or right up there  You've heard this fucking song  Travis, you got a little piece of that for everybody?  This thing?  So Kenny's singing this today, too  For a bit they're working on  And Troy and everyone very upset at Kenny  Here's a little taste  What faggot shit is this? 
[02:23:30]  Exactly  This is where music's going  This is so faggy  Unfortunately  You would not believe your eyes  If ten million fireflies  Lit up the world as I fell asleep  I like it  Cause they'd fill the open air  And leave tear-tops  Autotune  You'd think me rude  But I would just stand and stare  I'd like to make myself believe 
[02:24:00]  When is this, like, gonna be done  Like this whole musical fucking sound  Autotune  When is this gonna be  You listen back and go  Oh yeah, remember this shit?  Nah, it's here to stay  They're gonna adjust how they use it  But nah  It's not gonna be  I don't just mean the fucking autotune  I mean this sound  Cause I get down  This whole get up  Faggot  Bring back the guitars  What happened to the guitars? 
[02:24:30]  A foxtrot above my bed  A sock hop beneath my bed  This is a sock hop beneath my bed  What does that mean?  I don't know  Are we too old to understand?  Is that what's happening?  Don't worry, I changed some words  A crusty sock beneath my bed  You changed the words?  I changed some words  And I hear your producer Troy Kwan  Is not happy with you  Yeah, yeah  He's very annoyed about it  Uh oh, dissension in the ranks?  You know, you guys were working together  Like fucking  It was amazing 
[02:25:00]  And now you start getting  Egos involved  This one, he doesn't have  The same vision as me  Sam, what's going on  With this whole Firefly song?  That song stinks, by the way  Yeah  That's not good  Steve C's favorite is  10 million open flies  Troy doesn't like the song as it is  And then Kenny went in the booth  And then he started getting pissed off  That he had to do it  And then I told him  We gotta get a Rush copy now  And he started getting pissed off 
[02:25:30]  That he couldn't produce it  And then he was pissed off at Kenny  Because Kenny started changing lyrics  And Troy had a different vision  The partnership is over, I think  Wow  Troy is unfortunately starting to realize  That planning things in advance  On the Opie and Anthony show  Can only lead to disappointment  Of course  You cannot  Yes  Plan in advance  It's a fly by the seat of your pants operation  Everything leads to disappointment  Not planning in advance  Spontaneity  Everything 
[02:26:00]  Oh  It's just disappointing  Well here's Kenny's attempt  At singing the song we just played for you  It's very rough  Very rough, I know  It's not produced yet  I know  You guys are gonna go back and produce it  Dry tracks  Even more  Dry tracks  There you go  It's not a bad song  Got it  You would not believe your eyes 
[02:26:30]  All right  Hey at least Kenny's giving it a try  He really is  Trying to nail it, aren't you  He was instructed to give the softer side of Kenny  Yes, yes  Not that yelling Kenny that we hear on so many other songs  Yeah  I am a singing sensation  We just don't know it yet 
[02:27:00]  Are they gonna auto-tune you?  Oh yeah  There'll be some effects added  Yeah, this is a dry track  You would not believe your eyes  If ten million fireflies  Lit up the world as I jerked off  Right  Cause they fill the open air  And leave my sperm everywhere  You'd think me rude  But I would just stand and stare 
[02:27:30]  I'd like to make myself believe  That planet Earth turns slowly  It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake while I'm asleep  Cause everything is never as it seems  Kenny also has a lot of trouble staying in time with songs  Oh really?  We didn't notice that 
[02:28:00]  And this is  Didn't notice that one at all  This is what's got Troy really pissed  Yeah  He asked Kenny when we were recording several times to do it again  And Kenny insisted that his name was One Take Kenny for a reason  And he had done it right  But the track was too fast  Can't you do it again?  No  He's One Take Kenny  You're not  You can't duplicate perfection  Wow  But you  Your timing is all off  Well, he's an editor 
[02:28:30]  Let him edit  Look at this  But it's gotta go along  You just can't go along with the music, can you?  I never even heard the fucking song  I don't know how it goes  You wanna listen to it a few times and then try it again?  No, I asked if he wanted to run through it real quick  Just so I could tell him where the lyrics go  And he said, no, we'll do it in there  As in in the recording studio  He's a prima donna now  We sent him the song via email  And he responded  When was this a hit? 
[02:29:00]  So you have to take that track and try to make it into something  Yeah, I mean  Troy is not happy  When are we gonna hear his Lady Gaga?  Well, I mean  We could give it a sample of the Lady Gaga  I was just thinking we'd get some production around it  Alright, we'll wait  Yeah  By tomorrow, hopefully?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah  We just need to get a little production around it  Well, Ant said he likes the Jay-Z  We can play that  Which song?  The fucking Empire State of Mind  Empire State of Mind  Yeah, Kenny did a great version of that  That's  I heard that over a break  And wow  Alright, well  Kenny's good 
[02:29:30]  Yeah, I'm the new Sinatra  Sinatra  What's her big song, Lady Gaga?  Right now, Bad Romance  She's also done Poker Face  She's just a hit machine  I like her, man  I hate to say that  She's a hit machine  I told you  I like her  Yeah  She's alright  We're gonna meet her  We're not gonna meet her  Yeah, we're gonna meet her Saturday night  No, we're not  She's gonna be down there when Jimmy's down doing his shows  But I don't think we're gonna actually meet her  Oh, yeah  Oh, yeah  Yeah?  You're gonna make that happen? 
[02:30:00]  Yeah, whether she knows it or not  We'll meet her  Oh, that's good  Here's Kenny  That's her, as a dark-haired  Yeah  Who?  Stephanie Germanotti?  Is that her name?  Yeah  Are you a big Lady Gaga fan?  Let's see her panties  Gaga, Gaga, Gaga, Gaga  Don't spoil it, Kenny  Oh, really?  He's giving away the punchline already?  No  He's starting to sing the song live  What's wrong?  God, I gotta see that clit  I have to  She's fucking sexy, man  Yes  She's not sexy  Dude, you're nuts  She is a sexy girl 
[02:30:30]  And she's a big clit  She rules  Fucking Lady Gaga rules  She's original  She's a fucking weird hairdo  And a fucking clit  Let's see  What's going on in the pants there?  Exactly  How do you not want to fucking date her?  Wow, there's something  You know her giant clit  I want to put my face against her clit  And then go back and forth  Like I'm having my little nose boxed  By a small fist  I dug it, dug it, dug it, dug it  Alright, we're gonna meet Lady Gaga  Kenny's gonna be singing Lady Gaga tomorrow 
[02:31:00]  Zoom in  Zoom in  And, uh  Yeah, there's something  That's some pussy meat right there  Oh, I love her  That's a lot of pussy meat  God, that turns me on  There's something going on  Mr. Gorbachev  Put your dick through the wall  I just read that  Alright, let's see  Alright, yeah  What's going on there?  That's too low, really  It's droopy  It's a meaty pussy, man  She's got a droopy pussy  God damn  There's something going on there  She's got like a  It's big on one side, though, Jimmy 
[02:31:30]  That should be a little bit of a red flag  No?  It's all mushed in there  Oh, that's fucking fantastic  Oh, no  She'd pull her panties  It would just fucking fall out  It'd be like if someone picked up your suitcase  Upside down  And it wasn't zippered  Far  Fucking pussy  A sock falls out  Couple of fucking things of deodorant  God, is that fucking fantastic  There's no one I want to go down on more than her  Wow, what's going on there? 
[02:32:00]  Big pussy, that's what's going on there  No, but it keeps poking to one side  Exactly  It's all over the place  How would you tuck in a fucking giant gift?  Carefully, I submit  There might be a little peeny in there  No  It looks like there's a peeny in there  Oh, it's all puss  She's the fucking greatest  I want Lady Gaga to do a show  And then just sit on my face  They're all sweaty after the show  You know what would come out?  It would look like a fucking shell-less snail  It would just fall out  It would look like someone put a giant snail in a suitcase 
[02:32:30]  And then just opened it  Clumsily falls out  She'd come back into the dressing room all sweaty  And you'd be all waiting for it  And she'd go  Oh, do you mind, Jimmy?  I just have to make pee-pee  And I'll be right back  And then she goes and comes back  Smelling her pussy smelling of, like, sweat and piss  It'd be all caught in the flaps and the manifolds  Manifolds  It'd be completely in there  Completely  And you'd just stick your nose in there and go  Dude, I would fucking love her on my face 
[02:33:00]  Yeah  She's so sexy  Would you lick her asshole after a show?  Lick her asshole after a shit  What's wrong with you, Andy?  Of course you would  I just like hearing the answers  I know how they're going to be  That'd be great  Alright, so you guys working on it  Is it called Owl City?  Owl City is the band  Fireflies is the name of the song  And we'll have the complete bit tomorrow?  As long as Troy can get his act together and stop sulking  How the fuck  Well, let's get Troy in here

[02:36:30]  And Sam wanted to cut it down to a minute  We had four minutes  Yeah  So Kenny was upset about that  And then we said we had to go record this  And he didn't know the song  And he was complaining about it  And then he was improv-ing in there  And I'm like  You know, can we take another  Can we have another take at it?  You know, because  His timing is weird  You'd have to go in and literally chop up  Every single line, every word  Yeah, just to make it fit  It's a little bit easier on me  Yeah, and he refuses  He absolutely refuses  Kenny, why are you refusing?  I'm one take Kenny 
[02:37:00]  I've always been one take Kenny  I'm one take Kenny  I nail it one time  He's one take Kenny  I know  So that's what we have to work with  So  Well, that's something for tomorrow  Alright  But he changed the words  That bothers you too  That's fine  No, that's fine  He had a vision  No, it's not fine  Troy had a vision  He wanted to put on the effects  He wanted it to be like sweet Kenny  And then Troy would put on the effects  So it would be ironically  Funny  But then Kenny got in there  And started singing about  Jerking off and coming  Yeah, yeah  And it completely ruined Troy's vision  Kenny  Do you think maybe 
[02:37:30]  You could do another take  And just do the song  Yeah, just how it is  See that  How it was meant to be a song  You don't need to add in  Cheap jokes  Gutter laughs  You can just do the song  And it's good  Before you answer  Look at Troy  He's not happy  Well, plus I have to please  He's the person  That requested this dumb song  Who did?  He knows who he is  What are you talking about?  Sam?  No, no, no 
[02:38:00]  One of the upper management  Very important people around here  Specially requested  That I sing that song  Really?  That makes it good  Yeah  So I send this out to you  Buttercup  So you think you can do another take?  Yes, I will  I will  Really?  What?  Wow  Wow, that's crazy  Well, look who's to take Kenny  Oh, shit  Oh, shit  No, O and A  You know  You guys didn't get to be successful 
[02:38:30]  Where you are today  By not knowing talent  So I have to take your advice  We did  Yeah  So if you want me to do another take  I will do another take  Look, Troy Kwan's now smiling  I'm doing it for you  No, I'm not doing it for him  But he's your producer  You guys should get along  Yeah, but he does what I tell him to  I'm the artist  Alright, alright  You are the talent  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Who works for who?  Fucking Kenny 
[02:39:00]  Alright, we'll have those songs tomorrow  Yeah  Nice  Thank you, Kenny  Thank you, Troy  What else are you working on down the hall, Sam?  Anything?  Um  Oh, I was watching that True Life  I'm a fanboy  Is it good?  Yeah, one guy's a Power Rangers fanboy  Oh, God  He was just searching for a girlfriend  Who shared his Power Rangers interests  Good luck with that one  Does he have enough pocket money for his love?  Except they all have horrific stories  Of how they became fanboys 
[02:39:30]  Like this one kid  He's a Power Rangers fanboy  Because he walked in  On his mom  Who had just committed suicide  And so then  From that point on  He was raised on Power Rangers TV  So he's just got all this  Horrid stuff  Being masked by buying Power Rangers  Is he one of those kids  That has his whole room  Just covered with Power Rangers shit?  All over  He's got his Power Rangers swords  And he was building a set  Because he was going to do  A Power Rangers internet show  She probably would have lived  If he had just called 911 
[02:40:00]  Instead of yelling at his stupid  Power Rangers goals  Right  Could you power her wrist shut?  Speaking of fanboys  We've got the great  William Shatner tomorrow  On our show  He knows a thing or two  About fanboys  Doesn't he?  Bill, Bill  Good old Bill Shatner  Will be in studio tomorrow  I hate him  I miss that  New dramatic talk show  That he does  He sits like  On the guy's lap  I've never seen two people  Sitting closer  The seats are like  In an S shape  Almost  You know  Because he wanted to 
[02:40:30]  Face the guest  He didn't want to be like  Kind of next to the guest  So they kind of  Face the guest  Right  And his interviews  Are very in depth  People open up to Shatner  I thought that show  Would be like  Four shows and done  He's still doing the talk show  Like I said  They open up to  Bill Shatner  Good for Bill  Did they ask me to do that?  Do it  No, they didn't ask me  I'm lying  I'd do it in a second  I don't care  Who is that he's talking to? 
[02:41:00]  John Voight  John Voight  Anthony, while Sam is here  Big announcement  We had another wrestler  Die of old age  What?  Yep  No way  Another old time wrestler  Has passed  Who was it this time  Over the weekend?  Ludwig Borga  Ludwig Borga  What?  Ludwig Borga  How old was he?  70, 80 years old?  He was 47  Oh shit  Jesus  Who is Ludwig? 
[02:41:30]  He didn't have an extremely long career  But he was brought in  As the  Poor life  Oh okay  He was brought in  As the anti-American  From Finland  Who was  Feuding with  Lex Luger  The patriot  And he also ended  The undefeated streak  Of the Native American  Tatanka  Tatanka?  Yes  This is his claim to fame?  Yes  And he's  He never was able to beat  Lex Luger though  America won  Where is Lex Luger now?  Lex Luger is 
[02:42:00]  Well he had a terrible stroke  So uh  But he's a young guy  He's still doing autograph signings  Right  But he can't really grip a pen  He does it with the two fingers  And he kind of gives you  Like if you get a picture with him  He's very thin  He used to  He was known for being extremely muscular  Well yes  Now he's very thin  And he gives you a shaky thumbs up  How um  How old is he?  What is happening to these guys?  They're not making it to old age  Oh my  How could you love a sport  Or an entertainment means 
[02:42:30]  Whatever  That  That  Uh  Just kills people like this  That's Lex Luger  Well  I'd say  Wrestling I think  Maybe attracts  Damaged people  I don't think wrestling itself  Is what does this  You mean the fans right?  No  Not the fans  The wrestlers  I was assuming you meant to you  Same way actors are dying young  That's how Lex Luger  Her looks now?  That was like a couple months ago  Yeah  The actors are dying young  Brittany Murphy  Was 32 
[02:43:00]  That's you know  She's dying  She's dying of the new thing  The pills  There's that new fad  Where you take a bunch of pills  And drink  Legal pills  And drink  And then you're dead  Yeah  Yeah but wrestlers  Have been on that fad  Of taking far too many pills  For years now  They've been ahead of the trend  Yeah but they don't die right away  Like while they're taking the pills  No they don't  They guys  Yes  It's a slow  Painful  Miserable  In their 40s  In their 40s  In their 40s again 
[02:43:30]  Wow  And another thing  Dr. Drew's back with his celebrity rehab  Holy shit Anthony  Are you watching?  It's so good  And he has a stethoscope  I can't lie  He does  He always has a stethoscope around his neck  Anyone else knows he has a stethoscope  I did  We're not sure you're a doctor  Oh you are a doctor  I see  It's got a stethoscope  Is either that or a hat  With a DR on it  Right  And there's a lot of  A lot of arguing going out there  Is he exploiting these people?  Is he helping America?  What is he doing with this show? 
[02:44:00]  Both  Who is he helping?  You think both?  Sure why can't you do both?  If you are exploiting people  But you are also showing  It the way it is  Fair enough  Heidi Fleiss is one of the rehabbers  And we learned that she's living in Death Valley  Do you know where Death Valley is?  Somewhere in Nevada obviously  Have you ever been to Death Valley?  No  To where the Undertaker comes from  Oh sure he does  What a coincidence  That's why he's an Undertaker  Heidi Fleiss admits she takes pills 
[02:44:30]  And does drugs because of boredom  She lives in Death Valley  With a bunch of exotic birds  That's it  You learn exotic birds  She looks like a bird  She's nuts  And Tom Sizemore later on this season  Shows up at the rehab  Oh  And they don't get along at all  He's fucked up  And then Dennis Rodman  Well he called her a fucking  Rattled  What did he call her?  I forgot  That's a couple years ago  Rattling bag of bones  Yeah  Yeah they've gone at it  But this celebrity  Clack  Bitch  Who else is on celebrity rehab? 
[02:45:00]  Dennis Rodman  Dennis Rodman is there  But it's court appointed  Yeah they asked him  Why are you here?  Because the court told me to  He said he doesn't  He's not even going to bother  With this horseshoe  He went to the meeting  Drew's going to spew out at him  On the first day  He went to the meeting  And let everybody know  That intellectually  He was a level above everyone  So he could not  Succumb to addiction  Yeah  That's good  Good for him  There's a  What's his name  From Alice in Chains?  The bassist or whatever  Oh that's the bassist  From Alice in Chains?  The first one  I didn't get to see the whole show 
[02:45:30]  But I saw him in the background  He's very angry  Why is he angry?  I don't know  He gets really angry  When he goes through the withdrawals  Really?  And he starts like  In the next episode this week  He's going to start like  Attacking cameramen and stuff  Well Dr. Drew  He gets all these people  Into the rehab center  Before they go through  Their withdrawals  Yeah  Right  Episode 2 is the withdrawal show  Which is the best show  Of the season  So you got him  Breaking lamps  And just fucking up everything  Oh yeah  And them withdrawals  Okay  They got some guy  Who was on The Real World  Who they kicked off the show 
[02:46:00]  Because they said he was a drunk  But he came on rehab  And he goes  No  MTV was lying  I was coked  Out of my mind  Yeah  He was on coke the whole time  And they just didn't mention it  That was Real World L.A.  Or Hollywood  Or whatever it was called  Yeah  I remember seeing that guy  They kicked him off the show  To go into rehab  I remember  And then he came back  At the end of the season  And he looked like he was okay  And he said  He said on the plane  He started using again  On the plane ride home  Yeah  On the plane ride home  He was back using  So  Celebrity rehab 
[02:46:30]  Is definitely worth checking out  It's  Obviously it works  It's the best season  So the problem is  Everyone looks at Dr. Drew  Like he's such a nice guy  And all this  And he knows how to play the game  Better than anyone  Yeah  Yeah  He knows  Everybody's tired of that sad face  He makes when people say sad stories  Yeah  When people say they got molested  And he gives them the frowny face  Sad  When he just goes like  Hmm  And he puts his lips down  And goes  Hmm  Hmm  Hmm  Hmm  Hmm  What do you think Jimmy?  Celebrity rehab 
[02:47:00]  I don't know  It's not my thing  But I have been against it  There's so much room for reality television now  Because there's so many channels  Oh I don't care  Like what are you going to do?  So it's just one of the many things  It's one of the more interesting ideas  And the sexual rehab  At least they're  At least they're doing  Real people  And not this fucking phony repossession stuff  Right  Or phony assisted reality  Where they have a bad bed of music  And you know  Well should we get the groceries  Or should we order them online?  Boom  Fuck the Kardashians  I've never seen it 
[02:47:30]  The Kardashians  Is enraging  I was watching last night  It's fucking enraging  You don't even know why they're famous  Exactly  Because they're hot pieces of asses  Keeping up with the Kardashians  Well  The wife  Was trying  Had herbal male enhancement pills  And so she wanted to give some  To Bruce Jenner  Her husband  Who's an Olympic champion  By the way  And so she  She worked fine  She slipped them in his coffee  But the son  Drank the coffee by mistake  And had to go to the doctor  Because he didn't know  Why he had an erection  For so long  Oh wow  Cool that's not assisted either  That's actually the way it is 
[02:48:00]  It is  That's what happened  That really happened  Yeah that's just like the Osbournes  When the Osbournes just said  Turn the fucking cameras on  We'll give you some shit  Camera lesson  Mother poisoned the son  With cock pills  Yes  And then what happened  The kid came back  And he didn't know it was her  So he's fucking her  Because he thought  She was just two pillows  Fuck  That's stupid  Mackenzie Phillips  Is also on Celebrity Rehab  Oh yeah  Oh yeah yeah yeah  That's when she was on there  Before she went public  Is when they filmed it  Oh really  About the yeah  Because in the beginning 
[02:48:30]  Of the episode  She told Dr. Drew  Not to say anything  About the fact  That her dad was banging her  I did not know that  Yeah  She looks horrendous  Yeah  Yeah really  She's been clean  For eight months  Or something  She was bragging  Then there's the country music star  Who said  Oh Mindy  Mindy Cone  From the Max  Facts of Life  The Max of Life  The Max of Life  Yes  Oh it's the bra  That Clemens allegedly  Was having an affair with  Yeah she said she was on  Because she was addicted  To a relationship  Right  But then it says  Coming up next time

[03:18:00]  Has to be  70  What are you gonna do  Then  Alright let's take  A break  And figure out  What the fuck  We're doing next  Opie and Anthony  Have him fired  He's insane  Yeah  Oh wow  Doil  Randy you tuning  Son of a bitch  Sounds like  Number one hit  Gross on you though 
[03:18:30]  I reckon I like it  Avatar  Avatar is already  The number two movie  Of all time  Money made  Wow  Would you like to guess  Which is the number one movie  Of all time  Money made  Titanic  That's right Anthony  That was an easy one  Da da da da da da  For an Apache  The Bronx  I remember that one  Avatar made another  48.5 million dollars  Another 48.5  Third week out right  Why would they count the five 
[03:19:00]  48 million and five  48 and a half mil  That's a big five right there  I haven't heard  From a lot of people  That really like it  Oh come on  Like I've heard people  Go  It looks good  It's cool  You know  I like the 3D  But the story  I mean  It's not like  Oh my god  That was an amazing  Fucking movie  Well the story  Doesn't blow you away  But it's not a bad story  It's a basic story  Visually it's amazing  No one's telling me  That it's an amazing movie  And it's fucking  Gigantic 
[03:19:30]  You gotta go see it  Fuck that  And then  Then you  It'll answer all your  Questions for you  Yeah I like  Obviously it's a  It's a  It's a fantastic movie  Because of the  You know  The technology  And it's used properly  I wanna go see it  Actually  I think  And then the storyline  Is a basic storyline  Without the 3D  The movie would not do as well  Absolutely  You're right  You know what annoys me  And the other  Hold on  Really fast Dan  And the reason why  These numbers are so fucking high  Is because  The theaters and all  Are paying  Wait  How is this  No I guess 
[03:20:00]  I guess you  The moviegoer  Is paying for the  3D glasses  Basically  Oh yeah  Yeah they've upped  The ticket price  To cover the cost  Of the glasses  Well then you should be able  To take them home  So they didn't factor  That into this  As much as they  Probably should have  They're making a lot  Of extra money  Because it's a 3D movie  I don't know  You know what cost me  $39  For two tickets  To see Avatar  $39  I think they look  Too cartoony  The fucking  The fucking blue people  Thingies  Look too cartoony 
[03:20:30]  It's like  Oh there's great technology  I understand the technology  But they look  They don't look like  Real creatures  No no no no  No no no  No no no  They look cartoony  Because of the version  You're seeing  Because they're just  Showing that on TV  You gotta see that in 3D  No  It looks complete  No it's not  No the  The blue people  The Smurfs  In the woods  Whatever you want  To call them  Yeah  They look totally  Different when you  See them on just  Regular TV  Than you do  Under the 3D technology  Absolutely  Wow  Yeah 
[03:21:00]  They look very  Kind of hack and fake  When you just see them  On regular TV  Absolutely  Yeah they look  Too cartoony  Yeah  But then you throw  The 3D shit in there  And then it kind of  All makes sense  And comes together  Yeah  Just go see it  No I don't go  To the movies  Hate going to the movies  Yuck  What's that  What's that fucking  Gulf War movie  Coming out  Tomorrow on video  Blu-ray  Oh the  What's that called  Danny  The  Fuck  Hurt Locker  The Hurt Locker  Yeah yeah  That was good 
[03:21:30]  You saw that  I did like it yeah  Yeah I wanna see that  Yeah  I thought it was about  A place where they sell  Hurts  Like the Foot Locker  Sells Shoes  No it's not that  Shut up Chip  I wanna see that though  The Hurt Locker  Looks like a good  Good movie  Did you see it  No I did not see that one  About the guys  Who work on like  IEDs and shit  In Iraq  About guys that  Find the IED 
[03:22:00]  It's a pretty cool movie  I read a review  It said yeah that's one  That we should see  Another one coming out  On DVD is  The Moon or something  That's getting a buzz  Saw that one  Was it good  Saw Moon  The guy  With Sam Rockwell  The guy thinks he's  Living on the moon  Or something  But he's not  He's crazy  No he is  He is  He's actually living  On the moon  I won't blow it  Did you like the movie  There's a twist to it  And everything  I thought I was gonna  Like it a lot more  Than I did  That's for sure  What movie  It's called The Moon  It's called Moon  It's a bit of a buzz  On that one  No the 
[03:22:30]  It's a guy on the moon  Oh just called Moon  Yeah  Just kinda put it there  It's one of those  Deals where  You gotta go up there  For like a three year stint  But I guess you make  A shit load of money  And then you come back  To Earth  To run this  You know you're up there  Alone  Running this  Like thing where they  Take natural resources  From the moon  And ship them back to Earth  In the theaters now  So it's his job  To do that  No it's on  It's on DVD  It's on DVD  But um  Yeah I found  A copy underneath 
[03:23:00]  A sofa  A rock  Somewhere  It would suck  It was great  It would suck if it was about Warren  Yes it would  Let's say hi to CJ  Just about an ass  Hanging out a window  The whole  For an hour and a half  Of an ass  Yes I'm out the window  CJ in Georgia  CJ  Hey guys  I was just gonna say  Real quick  The 3D glasses  Don't only make it 3D  They also increase  The contrast  Of the movie  So it makes the brighter  The brightness brighter 
[03:23:30]  And the darker darker  It makes it a lot  Oh bullshit  Why can't I just  Adjust the contrast  Huh  I'm having a tough time  Explaining that to Anthony  When I see the Avatar  Blue people on regular TV  It really looks out of place  In cartoony  But then you put the glasses on  And it really does  Just all come together  Yeah I saw it for the second time  Over the weekend  And I just  Kind of  Spent some time  Experimenting  Looking at the characters  Like with the glasses off  And then on  And it makes a huge difference  Yeah  Alright I'm coming out  Bye  Alright guys I gotta roll  You know 
[03:24:00]  Gotta go do something  With the old newspaper  And then I gotta go to  Hey  You go ahead  Jay Leno tomorrow  Jim Norton  Yes and I'm back  Back  I'm on the red eye  I'm back Wednesday morning  And then I'm back for a while  Alright  So lucky you  Say hi to Mr. Leno  I imagine he's in a good mood  For us  I would imagine  You might have some info  For everybody  When you come back  For all the info  Yeah well let's see  Alright Jimmy  Have a safe flight  Thank you  Yes  I hate to be killed 
[03:24:30]  What are you doing  Jesus  Terrible  Check out  Jimmy and Leno  Tomorrow  What else  We're kind of  Wrapping up here  Yeah  We did the  Bogovic  We got Kelly  And William Shatner  Tomorrow  We did all the  Football action  Shatner  We did  I'm gonna have to  Ask him about  How he feels  About that new  Star Trek movie  You're gonna  Put him in a tough spot  Why  Because I'm sure  He wasn't in it right  No but Spock was 
[03:25:00]  That Nimoy  Gets in every  God damn movie  So if Spock  Was in it  You gotta think  They had a  Place for  The great  William Shatner  But probably  He was insulted  By the spot  They had for him  That's my guess  We're gonna ask him  If he was offered a part  He's gonna say yes  I'm sure it's on the internet  Disansor ready  But whatever  We'll find out  I'm trying to think  Where he could not  Possibly fit in that movie  At all  No  Like Spock  It made sense  Because Vulcan  They live longer  You know 
[03:25:30]  So he was able  To be an old  Guy  That went back  In time  And met  You know  Kirk then  But what are you  Gonna do with a Kirk  What are you gonna do  With a Kirk  The way he is now  I'm sure they would've  Been able to figure  Something out  If he was  Maybe they'd have him  As a hologram  Or something  I don't know  That's just plain silly  I know it is  Like look at that  That's perfect  That's fucking Kirk  And Spock now  To me  I don't even need  Shatner as fucking 
[03:26:00]  Kirk anymore  Or Nimoy as Spock  I'm gonna tell him  Cause J.J. Abrams  Did such a great job  At this  The casting  Was fucking amazing  This new franchise  For this old concept  That wow  People are gonna forget  Bones was fucking great  They're gonna forget  About the old guys  Immediately  That's it  Goodbye  I don't even care anymore  Fucking what  William who  Captain what  Are you gonna say  That to Lyle  Oh I'm gonna say  When I say  I'm gonna be like  He's gonna hate you  They recast it  To the point  Where  Just say they 
[03:26:30]  Recasted it  Perfectly  Perfectly  It made you  Forget about  Now obviously  The young Kirk  Did almost an homage  In certain parts  To Shatner's  Version of Kirk  Right  In certain scenes  But you didn't  Need it  Just tell him  He's like  He did such a great job  Tell him he's like  George Clooney's  Version of Batman  Who remembers  George Clooney's  Version of Batman  Right  Not even  Now it's just silly  Now it's  Even 
[03:27:00]  Because even after  Watching  The movies  The Star Trek movies  That came  Years after  The series  I was still able  To pop in  You know  The discs of  The actual series  And watch the old  Star Trek  With William Shatner  And there he is  Battling the Klingons  And stuff  You're trying to say  That after seeing  The new version  Of Star Trek  You have no  You have no reason  To have any  Of the old movies  Wiped every episode  Off my kaleidoscape  And pretty much 
[03:27:30]  Threw the CDs  The DVDs away  You erased your brain  Of anything that was  Star Trek before the new movie  Why would I need to watch  A giant engineering section  Of a ship  With much too much  Wasted headroom  And silly gadgetry  Are you going to tell  Them all this tomorrow  Please do  How come the bridge  Please do  Of the old Enterprise  Was as big as a room  Looks like a room  This was supposed to be  Before that  And it looked  Futuristic and great  And the new one  Cardboard  I'm going to tell 
[03:28:00]  Shatner all this  Please do  Shatner's getting  An earful from me  Oh wait see  There was a scene  Hold on a minute  Danny in Cleveland  Danny  Yeah Danny  But anyway  Okay  The scene  That was supposed  To take place  With Shatner  Was the scene  At the end  With Spock  As you guys  So lovingly say  Speaking over his dentures  To the new Kirk  Yes  And he  Gives him something  That was a gift  Between the two of them  Back in old Spock's day 
[03:28:30]  Yeah  And there was supposed  To be a voice over  From Shatner  Throughout the whole thing  And I don't think  He actually appeared  I think it was just  Supposed to be a voice over  Because they thought  The appearance  Would be too much  Of a hacky  You know  Tear jerker  Kind of thing  Yeah  But the voice  It's a deleted scene  On one of the editions  Of the DVD  And it's actually  Pretty good  It's a nice little thing  It kind of ties  Ties the friendship  Together between him  And Spock  So there you go  And you know what  Shatner can't be  In space anymore  Because that rug of his  Would just start  Floating around 
[03:29:00]  Unless he glues it  Down pretty good  Yeah  I'll put you down  Okay  All right  Kirk  What is this  The cameo would have  Taken place  At the end of the film  Oh it had a brief  Hologram message  From Kirk  You laughed at my  Hologram idea  And I didn't read this  Shit  It was a birthday  Greeting to Spock  And then a  Congratulations for  Spock's ambassadorship  Pinning down just  Which era  Kirk this should be  And then  It gets a bit  Maudlin  Okay 
[03:29:30]  See I don't  To me  It's over  William Shatner  What  Well he should be  Happy with that  Because he hated  That people kept  Acknowledging you know  Him for his work  On Star Trek  Right  Please  And then at the  At the  One of the  Comic Con things  That I went to  I hear he just  Shows up  Sits down  Alright get in  Get in line  Sign  He signs  Pockets his cash  And they might as well  He can't beam out of  There faster 
[03:30:00]  Then he runs out of  That fucking place  Oh my god  That place with  Dollar bills  Falling out of his  Pockets  Flying out of his  Pockets  He figures it's worth  Losing a few to get  Out of there fast  He runs for his life  When he goes to  Get out of there  I'll fucking ask him  All the tough questions  Cause now he's got  This show where he  Asks the tough questions  So we should be able  To ask the celebrities  We should ask the  Tough questions back  You're damn straight  Now I'm gonna sit there  And ask him questions  He better be sharp tomorrow  Cause  Anthony's bringing it 
[03:30:30]  That's it  I know more about  Shatner  Than Shatner  Shatner himself  Yes  Alright so that's tomorrow  What else  Wait  Bob Kelly tomorrow  Bobby  Bobby's coming in  Oh goody  Oliver Stone's got  A documentary  Series  It's gonna put  Mass murderers  Like Stalin and Hitler  In context  He calls it  What does that mean  It means  I know what context  Means  But I mean  What does it mean  In this situation  With Oliver Stone  The way he puts it  Is  Now over history 
[03:31:00]  People like Stalin  And Hitler  Have just been  The ultimate world  Villains  I mean  It's very easy to go  Well that's another  Here's another Hitler  Or  Oh as evil as Hitler  It's easy to look back  And just think that  They were just evil  Evil  Evil  Evil  Evil  When the fact of the matter  Is they were people  And there was  Some kind of cause  To make the effect  Of the evilness  So he's gonna show  How  As people  They turned out  Like they are 
[03:31:30]  And put them  In some kind of context  To show that  Perhaps  Even though they were  The evilest evilest people  Perhaps it wasn't  Pure evil there  And that the effects  Of things like  World War I  Had a huge impact  On what happened  And why things happened  In World War II  So they're gonna try to  Humanize them a little bit  It makes a little sense  Doesn't it?  It makes sense  When you read it  But a lot of people  Have that knee-jerk reaction  Of no  Right  Hitler needs to be 
[03:32:00]  Evil Hitler  All the time  And can never  Ever be looked at  As a child growing up  Someone that was traumatized  By serving in World War I  By the Treaty of Versailles  That pretty much  Just raped Germany  And then caused  20 years or so later  The effect that it did  Having a young man  Very disillusioned  Able to gather up  A bunch of other people  And you know  Carry it away  Why yes  Sure  But it shows like 
[03:32:30]  The cause  And then the effect  Instead of just the effect  And the evilness  But a lot of people  Giving him shit about it  Well that's his job  Yeah  To get people talking  And getting people pissed off  When is this movie  Going to come out  Oh it's going to be  A documentary  On I think it's  Showtime or something  Like that  Is it coming out soon  Has he started work  On this  Where are we at  Yeah I think it's  Coming out  Early next year  Oh shit  I'm not sure of the date  I'm sorry  I apologize 
[03:33:00]  I don't have that  Info  I apologize  But I read  I read his  Oliver Stone's  Kind of  Explanation of it  Because it's like  He has to  He's making excuses  For it  He says a lot of people  Won't like it  Because  Are you a fan  Of his work  Yeah  As more as  Entertainment  Than  Documentary  This is a  Is a documentary  This isn't  A movie  But JFK  I thought it was great  I knew going into it 
[03:33:30]  That I wasn't  Watching a documentary  Right  I knew it was  A lot of speculation  And a lot of his  Take on a lot of  This stuff  Platoon  Fucking great  Platoon was amazing  You know  So I'm a fan  Of his work  But as far as him  And some of his  Ideology and things  Like that  Ten hour series  This is going to be  Wow  A ten hour series  For Showtime  When does it hit?  We don't know  When it hits  Yeah  It's probably in the  Early stages 
[03:34:00]  I would imagine  Secret history  Of America  It's  Yeah  The way  Recent US history  Has been presented  In schools and media  It's just going to  Do a whole thing  But it does include  Like Stalin  Who by the way  You know  Stalin  Evil guy  Killed more people  Than Hitler did  But was a huge  Part of  Getting rid of  Hitler and the Nazis  But  You know  You look at Stalin  Just think  Well  There's a guy  That killed  A fuckload  Of his own  People  His resume 
[03:34:30]  Is a little rough  Ew  A little  A little rough  A little dented  Here and there  But  So I was  Looking forward  To seeing that  I read that  Last night  Very cool  All right  Yarr  Yeah I think  We could leave it  Right here  For now  Yeah  Let's take up  Tomorrow  We got  Shatner  Bob Kelly  Yeah  Stalin killed  Millions  But great hair  Yeah what a head  Of hair  That Stalin  Had  Right  Big head  Of hair  On that  That  Yosef  Stalin  Was it  Hair plugs  No I think 
[03:35:00]  That was all  Natural  That was a  Revolutionary  Hairdo  For him  Look at him  Brushed all  Back  All nice  Look at that  Head of hair  On that guy  Big thick mustache  But maybe he was  Brushing it back  To cover up a big  You think he's doing  A comb over  A comb back  Aw  Gotta do a comb back  Comb up  Shame  Comb forward  All meeting in the middle  What an insufferable prick  All the pictures  Of those old dictators  Just  They just look evil  You thought your father  Was a nightmare  Oh my god 
[03:35:30]  More than pasta  Against the wall  The head of your fucking  Your top dog  Your right hand man  Hitting the wall  Fuck that  There's a guy though  That stayed in power  For a while  Because he didn't  Trust people  And with good reason  You know  Everybody trying to  Kill him  And take over  Same thing with Hitler  How many times  Was he  Trying to kill him  Listen to this one  Jim in Allentown  Jim  Yeah  Yeah my neighbor  She grew up in Germany  And she said that
