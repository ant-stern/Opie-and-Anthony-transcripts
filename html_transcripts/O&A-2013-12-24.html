<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show's "Worst of 2013" compilation was a raucous affair featuring a mix of pre-recorded segments and live studio guests.  The broadcast kicked off with E-Rock hosting a segment showcasing a particularly memorable phone call to Barry Williams (Greg Brady) at 3:45 AM. Opie, initially thinking he'd reached Williams' answering machine, engaged in a surprisingly successful conversation with the surprised but ultimately good-natured actor, reminiscing about past visits to Williams' Bel Air home and a previous unexpected call to him in Branson, Missouri.

Next, the show featured an interview with Kevin Hart, who discussed his burgeoning career, his high-stakes gambling habits, and a disastrous *Saturday Night Live* audition.  This was interspersed with clips featuring other guests.  Vanilla Ice and DJ WhoKid were interviewed in studio, discussing Vanilla Ice's career, his reality TV show "The Vanilla Ice Project," his purchase of the publishing rights to "Under Pressure," and engaging in humorous banter about his past drug use and health.  Penn Jillette also appeared in studio later in the show.  The show also included numerous mentions of a Patrice O'Neal tribute show, highlighting the involvement of numerous comedians such as Colin Quinn, Bob Kelly, David Tell, Jim Norton, and Bill Burr, and the challenges involved in its production, including procuring photos and managing disagreements amongst the organizers.  David Tell appeared in studio during a segment dedicated to this event.

Anthony shared a series of harrowing anecdotes detailing his chaotic childhood in Tijuana with his alcoholic father, including dangerous car rides, bar brawls, and witnessing a tragic accidental shooting.  The show continued with a segment focusing on the aftermath of the Patrice O'Neal benefit, featuring discussions about the challenges of collecting photos from comedians for a commemorative project, and playful banter regarding the show itself, with discussion focused on the posters that were sold, along with humorous criticisms directed towards Bill Burr and Voss.  This segment also included an interview with Penn Jillette, during which he discussed his participation in *Celebrity Apprentice*, his new sea-salt chocolate vanilla ice cream, his charity Opportunity Village, and the legal and ethical challenges of his show *Bullshit*.

A significant portion of the broadcast delved into the *Celebrity Apprentice* competition between Penn Jillette and Trace Adkins, including a detailed comparison of their personalities and public images, rife with highly offensive language.  This discussion included numerous anecdotes about Adkins' life, including multiple near-fatal accidents, and contrasted with what the hosts perceived as Jillette's less relatable image.  The segment featured numerous listener calls, and a live appearance by Trace Adkins himself, along with Colin Quinn and Tom Papa, filled with humorous exchanges, political discussions, and banter about Adkinsâ€™ ice cream (maple macadamia nut).  Trace Adkins discussed his career, from oil rig worker to musician, his album of love songs, and his charitable work with the Wounded Warrior Project.  Guy Fieri also joined the conversation, discussing his career, his book, and a planned road trip.  The conversation was peppered with off-color jokes and anecdotes about Adkins' past legal troubles.

Finally, the show featured a brutal phone call with a recurring caller, "Lady Di," relentlessly berated by the hosts for her lack of employment and personal habits.  The hosts used highly offensive and demeaning language, focusing on her perceived laziness and physical appearance.  The conversation played a recording of a similar call from nine years prior, highlighting the lack of change in Lady Di's life. The call ended with "Lady Di" being declared "the worst of 2013" by the show.  The show ended with a brief discussion of Colin Quinn's experience on *Celebrity Apprentice* and the hosts' regret over not supporting him more openly.  Throughout the entire broadcast, the show employed frequent crude language and humor.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Shocking admission. James Lipton. A pimp is somebody who exploits the women who work for him.  I was a tour guide. I would say, you want to see some sex?  Shit face buffoonery. E-Rock drank all the Patron.  Everything is blurry. And whatever this is.  Normally I like a couple fingers up my ass. What the fuck happened?  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  Worst of 2013.  No.  It's the worst of 2013 for the Opie and Anthony show.  My name is E-Rock hosting this thing because everyone's on vacation. 
[00:00:30]  Check them out on Twitter at at Opie Radio, at Anthony Cumia, at Jim Norton, and the show's official account at O&A Show.  That's a lot to follow, but they've got a lot to say and a lot to keep you busy during this vacation week,  such as this worst of here that I have for you.  We're going to be playing segments from Kevin Hart and going south of the border into Tijuana.  Vanilla Ice will be in studio.  We talk a little bit about the first annual Patrice O'Neill tribute show that happened this past February. 
[00:01:00]  Penn Jillette will be in studio with Trace Atkins as well, talking about that whole debacle saga of what happened with Celebrity Apprentice and all their ice creams and whatnot.  And a return of an old character that we didn't really expect to ever return again, nor did we want to.  But we'll get into that a little bit later.  Starting everything off, in this segment here, it was one of those mornings that we were off to a slow start.  And Opie decided, well, you know what, let's not just get into the heavy stuff right away.  Let's pace it out a little bit.  And he thought maybe we should give a call to an old friend of his that he hadn't talked to in, I think, at least five years. 
[00:01:30]  Barry Williams.  So he dug through his phone.  Guess what?  Had the cell phone.  And we give Barry a call.  Does he pick up?  Does he care?  I don't think he does.  Let's find out.  Opie and Anthony's Worst of 2013.  Paul Anka friendship is way better than a Greg Brady friendship.  Yeah.  Should have called him last night and said he'd want to go see Colin with you.  Maybe I could check out Bel Air again.  I'll bet you can get it. 
[00:02:00]  That's where Greg Brady used to live.  You can get it.  Which is very.  What happened?  Why doesn't he live in Bel Air anymore?  Well, you know, he got a divorce.  And I learned over the years that he might have been living in Bel Air because of his wife.  Oh, no.  His wife had money.  Maybe she became the breadwinner after the Brady Bunch reunions dried up.  He lived in Bel Air at the top of one of those mountains overlooking everything.  Not anymore.  That was a past tense. 
[00:02:30]  Everything.  But he invited me over to his house, gave me his address and everything.  That's sick.  I remember being in L.A. driving up this mini mountain in Bel Air, looking at the numbers  of the houses, trying to find where Greg Brady lives.  And I called a really good friend of mine freaking out like a little fucking schoolgirl.  I'm going to Greg Brady's house.  You're not going to believe this.  What?  I'm driving to Greg Brady's house.  I had to tell people.  I'm going to tell someone now. 
[00:03:00]  And then I called.  Look, Brady Bunch is on TV as I speak.  Or some weird fucking commercial for the Brady Bunch.  Or some fucking...  They're using a Mr. Brady clip for some...  Publisher's clearing house.  Yeah, is that what that is?  All right.  Anyway.  So then I called family members.  I started calling everyone I know as I was getting closer to Greg Brady's house.  I needed everyone to know where I was headed.  Where are you at right now?  Yeah, I'm just on my way to Greg Brady's house.  And then I parallel parked in front of a ridiculous looking house. 
[00:03:30]  And then I walked up to the gates.  And I had to push the button.  And then he's on the other end.  I'm like, hey, hey, Barry, it's Opie.  Oh, you made it.  Great.  Let me budge you in.  And then I'm just gulping as I'm walking up the sidewalk going, I'm walking into Greg Brady's house.  It was the most surreal thing ever.  It was so fucked up.  Did he have Brady Bunch memorabilia on display? 
[00:04:00]  Oh, yeah.  A lot of it?  Yeah, but he had the Brady Bunch episodes, I remember.  He had all his Brady Bunch episodes on VHS tapes.  I always thought that was strange.  Is he watching them?  Hey, let's put it in another...  This was about 10 years ago, but I mean, people were definitely, you know...  In the DVD world?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  But I also thought if you're Greg Brady and you were on the Brady Bunch, you know, they had other ways to, you know, save this shit.  Sure.  But he was still in the VHS world. 
[00:04:30]  And we're all taped off TV.  Right.  So, and then I went back to Greg Brady's house another time, and that's when I had the famous leftovers, because I kind of came unannounced.  Hey, Greg!  My name's Barry.  Yeah, Greg, all right, great.  I went up there with my friend Jay, who moved out to L.A., and I was out in L.A.  I'm like, hey, why don't we go, why don't we go say hi to Greg Brady?  Yeah.  Why don't we go say hi?  I know where he lives.  Don't even worry about it.  Well, because at this point, I'm like, now I got to take someone to Greg Brady's house. 
[00:05:00]  Of course.  Now that I've been there, now I got to take someone else.  And did he give you that open invite?  Like, hey, come back anytime.  Yeah, so I called him.  You said it.  And he's a really nice guy.  Well, when he came to New York, I had dinner with him as well with a few people.  He's a really nice guy.  I'm kind of bummed we've lost touch over the last few years.  But anyway, so then I call him up.  He goes, yes, come on over.  We're about to have a little dinner or something.  I'm like, all right, great. 
[00:05:30]  So I went with my friend Jay, and he invited us in again.  And we had cocktails out overlooking everything with an infinity pool.  Ridiculous spot.  And then I remember being in his house as him and his wife at the time are looking in the fridge  just trying to figure out what they're going to serve us.  We've got to feed these guys.  You didn't tell me they were coming.  I didn't know they were coming.  And Greg Brady had a beautiful, like, pasta dish that was fresh, freshly made. 
[00:06:00]  And his wife, same thing.  And then I had the leftovers.  They didn't have enough pasta for you.  I'd have to go back into the archives, because I used to tell people what I had that day.  Do you remember, Iraq?  No, I don't.  I think I remember there was some kind of peas in it.  You'd be surprised, Opie.  It's not delivery.  It's DiGiorno.  Right.  But I do remember them looking into the fridge.  And, you know, I remember thinking, oh, fuck.  They don't have enough food.  They're trying to figure out what's cool enough to serve me. 
[00:06:30]  Do you think this caused their divorce?  I don't know.  I have no idea what caused their divorce.  Your friends just keep showing up?  No, I was only there, I think, twice.  Maybe three times.  How did you lose touch?  You just, time went by, and you just didn't talk to him?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't know what happened with that.  Well, you don't need him anymore.  You have Paul Anka in your life.  I mean, we were friends, but not friends' friends.  Yeah.  Like, I got friends.  I haven't, you know, like anyone else.  I have friends, and you don't see him for a bunch of years, and then all of a sudden you see him, 
[00:07:00]  and you just pick up where you were.  You should text him.  We weren't on that level.  You should text him again and pretend you were.  Yeah.  Text him and be like, yo, Barry, what up?  I don't, you know what?  I think I have his number.  If it's still the same.  I don't even know if it is.  I'll be completely honest with you.  I saw him a few years ago at a convention.  Right.  It was the same one where Virgil fucked up my million dollar belt, and he signed a belt,  but I didn't ask him at this time. 
[00:07:30]  And, uh, Barry's table.  Oh, we're calling him.  He's on L.A. time, so it's like three in the morning.  Yeah, quarter to four in the morning right now.  I hope it's someone else.  Oh, yeah, it could be.  Yeah.  Changes the numbers.  Hey, you've reached the original Greg Brady.  Say what? 
[00:08:00]  That's him.  That sounds like him.  I didn't hear a beep.  Where's the beep part?  Where's the beep?  Where's the beep?  Unless, maybe that was, maybe this is an answering machine.  Yo, Barry!  What?  Barry!  What is going on?  What's up, Barry?  It's not an answering machine.  It's not an answering machine.  I thought it was an answering machine.  You what? 
[00:08:30]  Barry, this is Opie.  How are you, sir?  Where are you?  You wouldn't know what time it is.  I'm in New York City.  It's nice and bright here.  Uh-huh.  It's not, it's going to be six o'clock at some point.  Where are you? 
[00:09:00]  Branson, Missouri.  Ah.  The Brady Brunch.  Yeah, you're still doing the Brady Brunch, right?  No, I'm not doing that anymore.  So what are you doing?  I've gone non-Brady.  Oh, you're doing non-Brady and Branson.  Yeah, I think it's called 70s Music Explosion.  No, 70s Music Celebration.  Nice.  Yeah.  So it's all 70s music.  It's all stuff before your time. 
[00:09:30]  I hear you.  I was just reminiscing about you on the show this morning, and I said, I'm going to call  Barry Williams and see if his number still works.  You know, you said, you said yourself, hey, let's, let's give that, that, that, that guy  the scare of his life, and call him, wake him up, and start razzing him.  No, I'm not razzing you.  I'm just saying hi.  I know.  Very different.  And I know you could. 
[00:10:00]  Listen, I miss you guys.  Things are going well.  I've got to come by and shoot you.  Yeah, absolutely.  I'm going to let you go back to sleep.  I'm, I'm very happy that you haven't changed your number, and we're going to do this proper  next time you're in New York City.  Obi?  Yeah.  Do not be giving this number out to anyone.  Have I ever?  No, you have.  You've been a good guardian of it for these, for these, for these many years.  Yeah.  If I start getting calls.  No, you're not going to get calls. 
[00:10:30]  I'm going to come out there and get you.  No, you're not going to get calls, sir.  It's all good.  Okay, great.  All right, buddy.  All right, man.  We'll talk soon.  We're in touch.  All right.  Bye.  See?  There you go.  There you go.  Friendship back on.  There you go.  That's wonderful.  Yeah!  What a moment.  I think this makes the podcast.  I really do, Sam.  The Opie.  This is strong.  This is a strong segment for the podcast.  The Opie-Greg-Brady friendship is back. 
[00:11:00]  He was so pissed, but he's also smart enough to know that he was on the air.  He knew he was on the air.  Oh, yeah.  That would be a very different conversation if he wasn't on the air.  He wouldn't have answered if he was pissed.  How funny was it?  The realization that that was not his voicemail.  I know.  Say what?  I totally thought it was.  I thought it was the coolest voicemail ever.  It's just, say what?  Like, where's the beep?  I thought he finally figured out the voicemail thing.  And then he's just on the phone not saying anything while we're all saying, where's the 
[00:11:30]  beep?  Right.  Oh, Anthony just wrote, hilarious.  Holy fuck.  This is great.  What a morning.  What a morning for broadcasting.  Anthony just wrote, hilarious.  Holy fuck.  Let's see.  And then Dr. Steve.  And Dr. Steve is mad at my gift.  And how I'm talking about his shitty gift.  Well, his gifts are shitty and Paul Inca's gifts are not.  Step it up.  He just wrote, I don't know.  That decanter sounds perfect for some suck my Pinot Noir. 
[00:12:00]  Tell him, Dr. Steve, you don't need him anymore.  Greg Brady is back in your life.  I'm not going to lie.  I was a little scared there.  I would imagine.  I was a little scared.  I thought he was going to get really fucking mad.  Because I actually really do like the guy.  He's a solid guy.  He's all right, Barry Williams.  Keep on.  Keep on.  Yeah.  Are you going to go visit his house in Branson? 
[00:12:30]  Holy shit.  When we do the bus trip.  Supposedly the bus trip is on.  Yeah.  I was given a date, actually, a couple days ago.  I forgot to mention that on the air.  Yeah.  Did they want you to mention it on the air?  Sometime in September, I could say that much.  Yeah.  But they asked if I'm going to be available.  And I said, hell yeah.  And if he's still in Branson, Missouri, we're going to hook up and become friends again.  Not only are we going to hook up, we're doing a show from his driveway.  How do you like that, Greg Brady?  That's right.  That's right.  How do you like that? 
[00:13:00]  You said any time.  We're doing a show from your driveway.  Yeah.  Johnny Bravo is going to be.  What's his name?  Johnny Bravo?  Johnny Bravo.  Johnny Bravo is going to be performing.  Tell him to get those tight bell bottoms on.  I'm sure he still fits into them.  Now I'm going to have to call him later.  I'm wearing him right now.  I'm going to have to call him later and apologize.  But that whole say what thing, I'm waiting for the beep, and he's sitting there wondering  what the fuck's going on.  It's an hour ahead of Branson.  Oh, it's not that bad.  So it's like quarter to six when he picked up the phone. 
[00:13:30]  Oh, that's not bad.  But if I haven't spoken to you in years, and it's quarter to six and my phone rings, I'm  not picking up the phone.  Yeah.  It's a good thing you're increasing your friendship level then now.  What do you mean?  Well, now you got Greg Brady back in your life.  So it's like...  You think I got Greg Brady back in my life?  100%.  Well, it's good to know that number still works.  That's so funny that you picked up...  I'm sure the home number doesn't work anymore, if you know what I'm talking about.  Somebody will pick it up.  How great is that going to be when we pull up to Greg Brady's driveway and do the Opie 
[00:14:00]  and Anthony show in his driveway?  And then we invite him on for a segment and then be like, they're telling us you got to  go.  That would be very nice.  See, what would be great about that is you could just be totally pushy.  Yeah.  And like, you're in the driveway and obviously you're going to do an interview with him.  And then you go, why don't you show us around the house?  So now he's got to show you around his house.  He's got to bring you in the garage.  Anthony's coming down the hall. 
[00:14:30]  He's got to be jealous.  He's a big Brady Bunch guy.  Wow, that sounded really shitty.  I thought the record slowed down, but I think that's just how shitty the kids sounded back  then.  They were never strong singers.  By the way, as Anthony's making his way in, don't forget my latest elevator show is  up in all the usual places.  You put it on the Facebook page, E-Rod?  It's on the Facebook, yeah.  All right, cool.  How great was that?  He's so pissed.  Did you hear this?  You could tell he's so pissed.  He was so pissed, but he also knew, fuck, I can't say anything because I'm on the air 
[00:15:00]  and I'm going to just look like an asshole.  Dude, there was a point where he was like ready to yell at you.  Oh, I know.  Yeah, I heard it in his voice.  I'm scared.  Not a joke.  He was ready to fucking yell at you.  I know, I'm scared now.  Because he goes, you call me for nothing.  Right.  But then, right at that moment that Ant's talking about, well, it was a goof.  I didn't even know if the number worked, so why not try it out live on the air?  That's probably when realization set in that, oh, shit, he's got me on the air.  Yeah, yeah.  I can't yell at him.  Right. 
[00:15:30]  Because I'll sound like a dick.  And you hear him, Opie.  Yeah, yeah.  He lowered his voice.  Opie.  There was that, what?  Like, what?  What?  Opie.  Oh, he was mad.  You're not going to give this number out to anyone, are you?  Yeah.  I'm like, look, I've been cool.  You know, I've had that number probably 10 years at this point.  Dude, I thought he was in LA.  I know.  I was like, oh, my God.  And I'm thinking, like, fucking 3.30 in the morning.  Right, yeah.  And he's got kids, right?  Does he?  Um, yeah.  I'm sure he's got loved ones.  Yeah, he's good. 
[00:16:00]  He lives with somebody, probably.  I said, um, because I think his kids would be, you know, obviously a bit older now.  I'm trying to figure out how old his kid or kids would be.  But that early morning phone call is never good.  It's never Greg Opie Hughes calling for the, you know, radio show.  But you hear the, I thought it was his voicemail.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, yeah.  You know?  That would have been a cool voicemail.  Right.  Say what?  Say what?  So they were sitting there like, all right, where's the beep?  I just want to quickly say, hey, it's Opie.  I just want to see if this number's still working.  Call me later.  And then all of a sudden it turns out it's him. 
[00:16:30]  Say what?  You've reached the real Greg Brady.  Oh, okay.  All right.  I love the Opie.  Opie?  I might be Greg Brady, but I will have you killed.  Okay.  Yeah.  I know people.  You know, his buddy Hinton's pretty badass and he probably knows him to come beat you  up.  It's going to be 6 a.m.  Eventually.  Yeah.  Eventually.  It's like, where are you?  Oh, Branson.  I felt bad for him, though, when he said he was in Branson.  Because Opie had just gotten over talking about his house in the hills in California. 
[00:17:00]  That was probably his wife.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's in Branson.  Bel Air, man.  This place was ridiculous.  It's where the Fresh Prince lived.  That's right.  Right.  Yes.  And there was Greg Brady stuff all over the house.  Brady Bunch stuff all over the house.  Oh, no.  He's just overlooking Yakov's Dinner Theater.  And then he had a nice home entertainment system.  Nothing too crazy.  Yeah.  But then he had all his VHS tapes of the Brady Bunch right there.  VHS Brady Bunch.  I swear to God, it was all VHS. 
[00:17:30]  So he could pull out any episode at any time.  Boom.  Greg caught smoking.  It's right there.  Boom.  We stole the goat mascot.  Right.  Right the fuck there.  Boom.  Boom.  The fucking UFO episode and the We're Selling the House episode.  Wow.  But you have to think they could have had a better way to fucking archive that shit.  Yeah, you'd think.  When you had Greg Brady, he's over there with his VHS collection of Brady Bunch tapes watching  every episode, Peter comes in.  Oh, my God.  And he's winging baseballs at people for bringing up the Brady Bunch. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It gets worse.  More of Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  Worst of 2013.  Coming up.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  Continues right now.  Hit it.  Yeah.  Now.  Now.  Worst of 2013.  My name is E-Rock.  E-Rock Radio on Twitter hosting this thing as we go through the year that was of our  Lord 2013 and all the cool shit that happened around the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:18:30]  In this segment here, we welcome Kevin Hart back to the show.  Kevin is a longtime friend of Jim Norton and most of the comedians that we have on this show.  And in the last two years, Kevin has just skyrocketed into superstar celebrity status.  Movies, world tours, hosting award shows, hosting Saturday Night Live.  This is a big fucking deal.  It's quite an accomplishment.  And Kevin's here to talk about all of that.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  On the Opie and Anthony channel.  There's nothing worse than seeing the person. 
[00:19:00]  And understand this, people.  I don't want people to think that I'm like the biggest asshole.  People are overweight.  It's just my way of motivating my friends.  At the end of the day, you can die.  It's serious.  So I had to use money to entice him to change.  So I had to give him a crazy amount of money as a goal.  And now I accomplish that by making him work out and fall in love with some nice change.  But it's nothing funnier to me.  I want to know how much.  I gave him 10 grand. 
[00:19:30]  10 grand back.  But then he got bonuses.  I put bonuses in there.  Holy shit.  So if he got past, if you got 50, if you got 50 pounds.  Yeah, it was 15.  15 for 50 pounds.  If he got to 15, I had to give him an extra 5 grand.  So it was 10 grand for 40.  Wow, damn.  If he got to 50, I had to give him an extra 5 grand.  So he got to like 60 something.  So I gave him 15 grand.  It's a world.  6,000 back immediately.  Yeah, and I told him to give me 6,000 back.  He was in Vegas and I was losing.  Give me 6,000 back.  Yeah, fuck that.  I'll try to get it back to you eventually. 
[00:20:00]  Is that a demon for you, gambling?  Is that a rough one?  No.  That you don't do it?  No, I don't have the time.  I don't have the time.  After you take a couple severe rapids out there, it's very hard to go.  You know what, man?  I want some more of this.  After you leave the table scratching your head and thinking about what you could have  did with that money.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the car right there.  I was just talking about it.  Oh, no.  All right.  Well, thank you.  And you get over the table.  You still try to talk to the pit bosses because you feel like at any point they can say,  do you want some of this back?  You're just waiting for the segue into your money back. 
[00:20:30]  Right.  So you guys, y'all here every day, right?  This is cool.  This is cool, man.  You guys are cool the whole time.  You see, I'm not the guy that gets an attitude about losing either.  I just sit down.  I don't disrespect the dealers or nothing.  You're saying everything nice, waiting for them to say something to you.  Yeah.  Here's your money back.  Yeah, you've been cool.  He's a psychopath when he gambles.  He told me he's a psychopath.  Oh, yeah.  Mental patient.  It's fun.  Blackjack.  Love it.  Is it blackjack for you, Kevin?  I have blackjack, yeah. 
[00:21:00]  I sat next to this Chinese lady one time.  She was the angriest, the angriest blackjack player I've ever seen.  But everything was in Chinese.  There was no, she never cussed or anything in American.  It was all Chinese.  But it was aggressive, like, to the dealer.  Like, yeah, that's that.  A lot of table slapping and fucking.  Look, and she would point and smoke a cigarette. 
[00:21:30]  But she was betting like five, ten grand a hand.  Just losing.  Like, it got to the point where I was feeling bad.  But I wasn't because I really didn't know what she was saying.  And I was like, I wanted somebody there to tell me.  Right.  But she kept pointing to the dealer.  Hey, show up!  The dealer was just.  The dealer didn't say anything.  They're unflappable, those guys.  Unflappable.  They don't have fun gambling in general.  I had a dealer that talked trash to me one time.  Really?  Yep.  I had a dealer.  I had this black guy who looked like he could dance.  And I just remember, like, I'm trying to, like, motivate myself. 
[00:22:00]  So I'm like, okay, you think I'm scared of you, man.  Listen, ain't no fear in my heart, okay?  We both tie shoes the same way.  Let's boogie.  Head up.  So I'm playing.  I'm like, you know, just being personality.  This guy is talking back.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, well, you think I don't want to take your money?  Took it.  Oh, shit.  He's like, took it.  Swiped it.  Uh-oh.  Got you again.  Oh, man.  I'd lose my mind.  He's like, bang!  He's putting out sound effects.  And I'm really, like, he's really doing what he says he's going to do. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  It was the funniest thing ever.  Would he have talked shit, though, if you weren't talking or no?  Do you think that was just joking?  No, no, no.  He was just playing back with me.  He knew I was.  He was just joking.  Damn.  It was all innocent.  But the fact that what he was saying was becoming a reality start.  My jokes just eventually just went away, and I got quiet.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  And all of a sudden, you're just like, no, this ain't fucking funny.  Not at all.  Yeah.  I'll just sit there and go, like, really?  Really?  I guess, what, 21, not even good enough at this table, right?  I guess not.  I guess not.  You know, 21 against a four, and then you just pull cards out where? 
[00:23:00]  Your ass?  Where?  Where's it coming?  Sir, sir, could you please, you know, watch your language.  Yeah, yeah.  No, I'm not mad at the dealer.  I'm mad at the cards.  Okay?  Yeah.  These cards are a real cunt.  A real ugly fucking cunt.  The cards.  The cards.  The cards.  The cards.  The cards.  The cards.  The cards.  The cards.  It's really nice to see alcoholism and gambling addiction flare up at the same time.  Yeah.  He has a pillow he could yell into. 
[00:23:30]  I think we might have told you all this last time.  Yes, you told me about it, Gail.  That is hilarious.  He punches pillows.  He bites pillows.  He yells into pillows.  It's like, bam, fuck.  I saw Keith Robinson.  We used to go to Atlantic City.  So Keith would literally be betting like $10 or $15 a hand.  So, you know, on the way home, like, I would have lost.  Like, at the time, I would lose like $800 or $1,000, which was a lot of money to me.  So I was like, man, I can't believe I just did it.  Oh, so Keith used to just laugh. 
[00:24:00]  Stupid.  How they lost $75.  I only play it with $75.  I love watching you lose all your little money.  Stupid.  Like, he would purposely just not gamble a lot.  Like, he would win like $5,000, $50,000.  But, oh, ow.  As I went on.  Ow.  Scooby-dee-doo.  Scooby-dee-doo.  Scooby-dee.  Scooby-dee.  Then he started like gambling more. 
[00:24:30]  But his wins would always be like, it would just be like $75, $80.  But on the way home, the ride.  Oh, he must have loved it, yeah.  Oh, take these 80 smackies.  I would probably buy some shoes or some DVDs.  I would buy some new DVDs.  What are you going to buy, stupid?  Oh, that's right.  That's right.  You lost.  Scooby-dee-doo.  With his awful dress pants with too much shit in the front pockets. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, he just, oh, you're a lot of noise for those guys.  Stuff's all in the front pockets.  He came back from gambling.  We walked in the cell the other night.  Or it was a podcast we were doing.  You see, he was in Niagara Falls.  There was something gambling.  And he won like a grand.  It was really $1,000 and you're feeling that good about it?  Ow.  What did I say?  Ow.  I'm into money.  1,000 smackies all time.  Smackies.  Smack-a-doodle-dinkies.  Ow.  It was a little shoopity-boop.  Like, you can think, listen, you can think that you'll laugh for a long time, but I say 
[00:25:30]  it gets you so mad.  Oh, yeah.  Like, when Keith needles you, it gets you so mad.  He's hateable.  It's the dumbest, he's saying the dumbest shit ever.  Like, ow, do-ba-da-bink boggles.  When you're playing chess with him and he picks up, don't touch my pieces.  Don't pick up my queen.  We'll call a pan if she got on.  He's smack-talking during chess.  Yes.  Ow.  Come here.  Let me rub your pawn's titties. 
[00:26:00]  My pawn.  Ow.  I want to know about SNL, man.  This is a big fucking deal.  Man.  Let me tell you something.  You've gotten to do a lot of cool things, obviously.  Is this your number one?  This is huge.  It is, right?  This is huge, man.  Especially as a comedian, to have the chance to be a part of, you know, this is history for me.  You know, and writing my book and writing my path, this is a huge step.  I talked to Lauren for like two hours last night. 
[00:26:30]  We go to dinner.  And literally just hearing the information, the stories, and really understanding the careers and lives that he's affected.  Like this, you know, when you think comedy, he's really been a part of putting today's names that are huge, monumental, in a theatrical sense, comedic sense, improvisational sense.  They came through him.  So many people did.  It's like just his eye for it and him understanding the process of why it takes so long.  And he remembered that I auditioned and didn't get it. 
[00:27:00]  Like why I didn't get it.  Yeah, dude, it was the best kind of decision.  Why did he tell you you didn't get it?  I was awful.  I was awful.  You're bad?  What characters did you do?  Listen, I did a, I did.  Okay, let me tell you something.  And I'm going to probably talk about this in my monologue.  So I go and I'm auditioning for SNL.  And, you know, they're like, you got to do characters.  But I'm like, I don't have any impressions.  I don't know how to do anybody.  But, you know, what characters do I do?  I just didn't understand the sense of characters.  Now, I'm seasoned, so I know characters.  I can be different people and joke, whatever. 
[00:27:30]  So I'm like, I guess I just got to figure out some impressions.  So I did an impression of Avery Johnson, right?  Which I soon learned that a lot of white people didn't know.  I was just going to ask you, he's an actor, right?  No, he's a coach.  He's a basketball player now.  He used to be.  Yeah, basketball player, turco.  So I found out nobody knew who Avery Johnson was, which made me a little more angry.  Because I'm like, you know, if you knew who he was, you would know how good of an impression.  How good this is, right?  It's his.  I'm doing an impression of nobody.  They're like, no, we don't do it. 
[00:28:00]  So after that, I tried to do like Denzel, but it sounded like me doing Denzel.  So it was just bad.  It was just bad.  Maybe you should have started off a little less obscure.  But my energy was great.  My energy was good.  And I didn't have stage fright.  I was just awful.  And then he said, it's amazing basically to see me come as far as I've came.  With so little to work with.  Knowing that you have no talent at all, Kevin. 
[00:28:30]  It's amazing that you've gotten this far.  So wait, what was your Denzel impression?  Do you still do it?  My Denzel impression was just bad, man.  You don't do it anymore, huh?  No.  I told you.  It's not even the impression.  It's me saying, you remember when Denzel said this?  That's in my voice.  Oh, shit.  Remember the small one from Denzel.  Hey, here's Denzel on training day.  King Kong ain't got nothing on me.  That sounded like you just saying what he said.  No, no.  No, that stands out, right?  That stands out.  What year did you audition? 
[00:29:00]  Oh, man.  This is like 2004, 2005.  It came down between me and Dean Edwards.  And Dean Edwards got it.  They never used Dean right either because Dean did an amazing rock.  He did a great Denzel Washington.  He had some great impressions.  Fantastic.  And I think that they did not use him properly.  He didn't do a great, like a legit Michael Jackson, too.  He didn't do a hacky Michael Jackson.  He did a great one.  So here's my funny Dean Edwards story.  So the night that he gets SNL, he gets a call, and it was down to me and him, right?  So I'm like, oh, man, I might get it. 
[00:29:30]  This is crazy.  Oh, shit.  You know, like Dave, my manager, was like, yeah, Kevin, it was something about you they  liked.  So, you know, your impressions weren't great, but you did a good job there.  It's between you and Dean Edwards.  So I'm like, oh, this is exciting.  Oh, and then you're thinking, like, this could happen.  Oh, this is going to happen.  This is going to be the biggest thing ever.  So Dean Edwards gets the call.  He pulls me to the side.  He's like, yo, man, he just called me.  I got it.  Now, Dean is a friend of mine, so I'm happy.  Like, man, congratulations, Dean.  This is huge for you, man.  This is going to be great, dude.  So we go into the cellar. 
[00:30:00]  So me, Dean, Tracy Morgan, Big J, and I think Keith might have been there, too.  We're all at the table.  We're all eating.  Dean just told everybody, man, congratulations.  This is great.  Chris Rock walks in.  Chris comes in.  Dean, man, I just heard you got SNL.  Oh, man, this is great.  Congratulations, man.  You got to work hard, though.  You got to write.  Make sure you come in there and you really put forth the effort.  Tracy Morgan is at the other end of the table.  He's eating.  All you hear is Tracy's fork. 
[00:30:30]  It drops.  It drops like bangs against his plate, right?  So Tracy goes, I wish I had somebody to tell me shit like that.  So Chris doesn't say anything.  He just looks at Tracy, right?  Tracy says, and this is word for word.  He says, I got blood on my knife and shit on my walls.  What the fuck?  Picks up his food and starts eating again.  And Chris goes, stay away from him.  Yeah, that's another piece of advice. 
[00:31:00]  It just walks out.  It just walks out.  Listen, but after Tracy said, I got blood on my knife and shit on my walls.  He said nothing else.  Just started eating.  Just continued eating.  That was Dean Edwards' advice.  He speaks to these weird metaphors, Tracy, and they make sense to him.  It makes sense to him, yeah.  I was talking to him.  I was walking in the cell one night and Tracy's there and I said hello to him.  And he goes, got to get that lunch pail.  Go to work.  Where do you want me to go with that?  Where do I go with that?  Yeah, you do.  Hi, Tracy. 
[00:31:30]  Good to see you again.  What's the schedule for us now?  Is it as brutal as they say where you guys are just up all the time just trying to get it all together?  It's late night.  Yeah, late night.  So you start mid-afternoon and then you're going to about 1 a.m., 12 a.m.  But the good thing is it's just creative.  It's non-stop ideas.  Everybody's pitching.  Everybody's coming.  And because, you know, everybody has an equal chance to get their sketches on.  So there's a process. 
[00:32:00]  You know, you can't just go and yours is going to be picked.  You got to do it and write it and get it up.  And then there's a room where we see what's good, what's not good.  And then there's a chopping board.  And some things make it, some things don't.  Then last minute changes.  It's constant.  Is it up to you to pick some of them?  I can go in and say what I like the most, but I think the strongest overall sketches for that particular episode of that night are the ones that will.  You ever hear somebody go like, oh, man.  I'm going to tell you what's funny. 
[00:32:30]  So the first day, you know, I go in the room and I sit out and I'm there with Lauren and all of the cast, all of the writers all come around and everybody tells you the ideas they have for you.  So you got to sit there.  It's about 40 people.  Wow.  But everybody's going through the process.  And it's funny because some people's pictures are bombing.  But the thing is, they let each other know, like just like comedians, you know, like somebody's like, yeah, you can see people get nervous in the middle when they see it's not going well. 
[00:33:00]  So like, and that's when you're like, you know, you'll do it and then come in and then somebody yell out, should have reversed it.  Should have went with the other one first and closed with that.  That shouldn't have been your closer.  And they don't fake laugh, though.  No, no, no.  That's better.  It's all real.  Good.  All real.  No fake laugh.  Like when an idea is genuinely funny, it's funny.  But they're all just rough ideas.  And literally, like all the people, you can tell who are the writers and who are the personalities because, you know, the writers are very bland. 
[00:33:30]  Well, it's like, you're a funny guy.  This will work.  Yeah, yeah.  You'll go into a little bar and you'll talk, right?  And then, but you're the guy who just repeats what the other person says.  You do it louder than them.  And then you get mad.  And then maybe it's whatever.  It's just it's just an idea.  That's how it is.  Have you pitched any like one?  You felt like, hey, this should be kind of funny. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, I had a couple that I pitched out.  Did it bomb?  Did it do OK?  No, I'm pretty fucking amazing.  Well, I think you'll be a good host.  I think Kevin will be a really good host.  It's going to be fun.  This is going to be fun.  And Christoph Waltz, Bieber, like they're not stand ups.  I mean, have a stand up.  This is going to be a lot of fun.  And it's my element.  Like, this is what I love to do.  So from the improv, from the sketches, from literally creating these, these, these, these  environments.  And we're all, you know, we can be who we want to be. 
[00:34:30]  And they allow me to bring what I want to bring to the table.  And the live doesn't get you.  I don't know.  That makes it more exciting.  Right, right.  That makes it more exciting.  Yeah, and it's, it's not, it's not at all physically nauseating to hear him saying,  this is my element.  This is where I, I think he'll be a great host, man.  And I think that you'll pull a sketch if a sketch isn't working.  Because sometimes, man, one thing they never do on that show, and I admire it, is they  never wreck this sketch when it's bombing, which as a stand up is so hard to not acknowledge  the bomb. 
[00:35:00]  And you know how we, we will get out of a bomb by just acknowledging it and mocking  it.  They stay in it.  Fucking full steam ahead.  They never break.  Sudeikis is really funny.  He's been, he's been having me on the floor.  Seth is smart, man.  Like, you know, he's one of the head writers, but he's, he's great.  Like, literally, literally, I respect his, his work ethic.  Kenan, Kenan has had me laughing a lot.  And Bobby, Bobby's funny, but it's like literally when you just see the, the cast members, I had  no idea.  They literally, they create just as much as the writers, just as much as the other showrunners. 
[00:35:30]  Everybody is involved in the creative process, which I think is smart because, you know,  it makes everybody work hard because everybody's motivated to get to the top spots.  Yeah, you have a piece of it, you know.  It's, it's, it's pretty insane.  Yeah.  I heard they're pretty welcoming there too, because you're really going into a club where  everybody's a member but you.  And it's like, I heard, but I hear they're very good at making you comfortable and feel  welcome.  I, the way, the way that I feel now, I feel like they're excited.  I feel like they're excited that I'm there and there's like an energy and there's a great 
[00:36:00]  energy around and nobody's, nobody's been afraid to present things to me.  But what did, what did catch me off guard?  Like, you know, at one point you're really questioning your talent because when they sit  you in the room, they're like, Hey Kevin, so real quick, we just want to know some  things.  Uh, do you sing?  I'm like, no, no, I don't sing.  Uh, do you do any impersonations?  No, no, I don't have any, uh, impersonations.  Uh, you dance?  Nah.  I don't know.  You see him checking things off.  Oh, man. 
[00:36:30]  I think we'll save some skits for next week.  I have no talent.  What do you do?  I'm, I'm funny.  I know how to do that.  I think that's, that's pretty much it.  Okay.  Yeah.  Well, we, you know, we got some things we'll figure it out.  And then I just, you see him writing on a, on a notebook as they walk out.  Oh boy.  It's going to be a tough one.  You just hear it mutter.  If you would have gotten it years ago when you auditioned for it, do you think you'd have  done well or, or like even at that time, not with knowing what you know now in hindsight, 
[00:37:00]  but then do you think you'd have fit in or been able to that competitive?  Cause I've heard it's very competitive with sketches and stuff.  I think I know I'm a workhorse.  So I, I would have literally put the work in to try and get to, you know, whatever successful  point I've could have reached, but you know, the writing and stuff would have been great  for me and doing that because I love to write.  I love to create, but there's no telling where, where I would have been, you know, as far as  within the show, the success of the show, because there's so many people. 
[00:37:30]  So right now, well, if they needed a Denzel, they got, how do you, it's, it's, you should  have said yes to all those questions.  That would have been the greatest.  Oh my God.  Very well.  Same.  Absolutely.  I actually had a record come out, but there's a whole contract thing, impressions, and then  name people that you just, it's impossible to do.  Yeah.  It would have been the greatest.  A really weird, obscure, obscure person.  I like you, Rosemary Clooney.  How embarrassing would that have been, man.  And they write a big Denzel sketch or a big, I got nothing. 
[00:38:00]  No, nothing, nothing at all.  Somewhere around Friday morning, they knew they were in deep trouble.  I've been avoiding, I've been avoiding the rehearsals all day.  Hey, Kev, so you want to do the Denzel thing?  I just kind of rather wait to do it on the day.  Yeah.  I think to really give it up now is better.  Spontaneous.  Yeah, I like being spontaneous.  Because I want y'all to laugh and like you've just seen it for the first time.  Oh, they're horrifying.  Trust me on this.  Yeah, trust me, guys.  All right, Kev, you want to read the cue cards or anything now?  Unless everything, let's just save it for the day. 
[00:38:30]  On a day, it's just a train wreck.  I got nothing.  I got nothing at all.  My Denzel is horrible.  Oh, that would be fucking great.  Kev Korg ain't got nothing on me!  What's he doing?  Why is he yelling?  Asking me to dance.  I'm tap dancing.  I got tap dance shoes.  Just bad.  This is awful.  That would be terrible.  Ha, ha, ha.  I'm doing noises.  I'd watch it.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Kevin, oh, what's he doing up there?  We're all watching this Saturday. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, this is one we're watching.  I never watch SNL.  No, I'll be watching.  I think you'll do great.  We watched Louie's.  Louie was very funny, and I'm sure that you'll be great at it.  I can't wait.  Oh, fuck.  The cue cards.  Are you worried about the cue cards or no?  No.  You don't care?  No, no, I don't care.  Because a lot of times you'll see them look up, but again, they're pretty good at not giving  away that they're...  Well, too, you know, the schedule is so crazy that, you know, even with the cue cards stuff  and the show being live and it being last minute decisions, once you know what you're  doing, the people that are part of those things are kind of locked into it. 
[00:39:30]  So you know the beats of it.  So even if the cue cards are there, you know the ballpark of where you're supposed to be.  So you just stay within that vicinity if it ever looks like it's, oh, I don't remember.  Cue card guys could fuck you over, though, man.  Yes, they could.  If they don't like you, they'll just, like, you know, take their time.  A little slow turn.  A little slow turn.  Brandy?  Who put a question mark on the teleprompter?  No, they definitely could.  But, you know, once again, if you're involved with what it's supposed to be, you see everything 
[00:40:00]  go down from all the changes.  You should pay them off before Saturday.  Just make sure they're well fed.  Dude, I'm really hyped as if this is a basketball game.  Right on, man.  I'm pumped up.  What is the two other things to talk about, too?  One is the celebrity all-star game you did.  What did you do with Usain Bolt?  Oh, I beat him going up and down the court.  I challenged him to a race, but we had to dribble the basketball.  Oh, okay.  So basically him dribbling. 
[00:40:30]  So you just throw the ball out in front of you, but you got to keep bouncing the ball.  So I smoked him.  I set a world record.  Come on.  Really?  No.  Well, we don't.  There's no way to prove it, but there's no way to say I didn't either.  At the end of the day, I beat the world record holder, which means I probably set a record.  He's an amazing athlete.  Oh, my God.  He's ridiculously fast.  To see him run.  Ridiculously fast.  Unbelievable.  Ridiculously fast.  You have to see the guys that just have so much athletic ability, but it's like they  don't know what to do with it and certain stuff.  He can't really play basketball, but he can run and jump real high. 
[00:41:00]  So for unnecessary reasons, he's jumping above the rim.  He's like, no, no, you're saying you have to shoot first.  You don't jump.  You do it with the ball.  Just taps the ball on the backboard and lands with it?  Yes.  He has no idea about the game, but then he just dunked.  It was crazy.  He's an athlete.  And, you know, I mean, it's the thing.  It's a two-time MVP.  I'm not sure if you're aware of this.  I was not aware of that, but I'm happy to hear it.  Yeah, it's just whatever.  Who are you the MVP in? 
[00:41:30]  The celebrity also.  Whatever game.  It's never been done.  Whatever.  Two times.  You're the first one to get two times.  Yeah.  It's never been done.  They didn't think it could be done.  No.  No.  No.  I think, you know, after achieving such an accomplishment, you know, they're like,  well, do you want to come back next year?  And it's like, well, how much better can it get?  I've won twice the more valuable player.  I have two amazing trophies.  So I'm very humble about it.  Get a third.  I mean, if Daniel Day-Lewis can do it, there's no reason you shouldn't have a third.  You know, I'm thinking about it.  You've got to go first.  I mean, it's just tough. 
[00:42:00]  At the end of the day, it's a fun time, and I think I'm taking the fun out of it.  Right.  By continuing to involve myself and win.  By dominating so much.  Well, it's beyond domination.  Yeah.  It's beyond domination.  Little bit.  Who else played this year?  I don't think that's really important.  I don't think that's really important.  Oh, Mary, that's fine.  Yeah, who else did play?  Who else?  John Goodman.  Right.  Betty White.  Who was out there?  Come on.  Y'all found out I crossed Betty White over.  Oh, Betty, I bust your head! 
[00:42:30]  Who played?  It's Trey Songz, Neo, Common, the guy, Joss Hutchison from Hunger Games, Terrence from the E Network.  They had some people out there.  That you would never associate with athletics.  But then after that, they had some NBA players, like the older guys that retired as well.  Like Dikembe Mutombo was on my team.  It was funny.  It was a good time.  It was fun.  Did he used to live in our building, Mutombo? 
[00:43:00]  Did he play for the Knicks or the Nets with all?  No.  Or was it Manute?  One of those guys lived in our building.  Manute Bull?  Just black guys that are tall.  No, was he one of those?  Why should I think that it's two different people?  No, was he either Dikembe or Manute, one of those players?  It was one of the tall, long ones.  It could have been Manute Bull.  It might have been Dikembe Mutombo, though.  You would have known it was Manute.  Did Dikembe play for Jersey or the Knicks?  I don't think so.  No.  And he might have been here for something else because I saw him in the garage.  And they said, yeah, that's him.  What if he was just visiting somebody, Jim?  Well, they said that their gun was caught. 
[00:43:30]  There's a chance that he could have just been making the stuff.  I met Manute Bull once.  It was unbelievable how fucking tall this guy was and how thin at the same time.  It was ridiculous.  It's like the Close Encounters alien that came out of the ship at the end of it, right?  He had the longest of these arms were like toothpicks and ridiculously long.  It was really long and passing.  I met Dikembe's son.  His son was 13.  His son is 6 feet.  Wow.  Does he have skills? 
[00:44:00]  I'll tell you that's because of his dad, though.  Guy who says he's a stupid kid.  He probably had heard of basketball.  Does he have the skills, though?  He said his son is good.  His son is good.  He said his son is good.  Listen, I've now thrown my son is at the age where he can play basketball.  So because of where I live, I can get my son into the great programs, basketball programs.  So you get there, it's all these NBA players and their kids.  But these guys, their kids have natural talent.  So at the age five, you're looking and you're like, wow. 
[00:44:30]  And then my son, he's out there and he's got two left feet on.  He's not even putting his sneakers on right.  He doesn't bounce the ball.  He's just messing up the game.  My son's just literally destroying the fundamentals of the game.  There's no, you can totally look out there and see who my son is every time.  And these other kids are really amazing.  But a lot of the sons don't make it to the NBA.  I'm surprised by that.  Dude, a lot of them don't, but a lot of them go far in the sport. 
[00:45:00]  A lot of them at least get to college for free.  A lot of these guys get scholarships for college.  Rick Barry had a bunch of sons, obviously.  I can't think of many guys that had their sons in the NBA.  Do you know any?  Right now, yes, a lot right now.  Right now, Del Curry.  Del Curry.  Steph Curry is in the NBA and his other son is playing for Duke.  Who else is really, really good that's playing?  My friend that plays for Syracuse with Wayne LaFalle. 
[00:45:30]  Meeks, I forgot Meeks' last name.  I know about a good five black guys whose kids are in the NBA.  They're doing well.  Kyrie Irving's dad played too, I believe.  Yeah, I don't, look, I'm a sports guy.  I don't know.  Kobe Bryant.  Kobe Bryant.  We forgot about the big one.  Jelly Bean.  Jelly Bean was in the NBA.  He was in the NBA.  Yeah, but he had more success in Europe.  Yeah, he was more.  He was overseas.  I went to basketball camp with Kobe.  Did you really?  Yes, I did.  Wow.  My style basketball camp.  Kobe played the whole camp left-handed. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, really?  I'm very serious.  What year is this?  This is in, this is my junior year, so probably 1996.  So he, oh, he was just a young guy.  Yeah.  That much better than everybody?  Oh my God.  He, he dominated the whole camp left-handed.  Literally.  He'd never, he worked on his left hand the whole hand.  Didn't use, didn't shoot with his right hand.  Is that what he was trying to do?  Just work on his left?  He was just working on his left hand.  He had specific instructions to work on your left hand.  Wow.  Wow.  So he played the whole basketball camp.  MVP of the camp.  Average 27 points a game, something like that. 
[00:46:30]  He shoot left-handed?  Everything left-handed.  Holy shit.  Jump shots, layups.  So do you know him now?  What do you remember?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, we both, we laugh about it.  LaSalle basketball camp.  Overnight basketball camp.  And I, that's when I thought I was going to the NBA.  Wow, shit.  That's what?  I had a basketball dream.  That's what?  Muggsy Bogues really, really deluded a lot of fucking small people.  He did.  Yeah, I had a real basketball dream.  Like, I'm not, I wish I could sit up here and say that I'm not one of those people.  That used to be my speech.  Kevin, you sure you're going to go to the NBA? 
[00:47:00]  Let me tell you something.  You think that they told Muggsy Bogues that he wasn't going to make it?  I had every small person's biography.  I knew everything.  Spud Webb, Earl Boykins.  I knew them all.  How far did you get?  To my senior year in high school.  And that letter from community college kind of set me straight.  Yeah, I'm going to probably get recruited by Duke and, you know, a bunch of people.  Community college sent me a letter after I figured out I got a 600 on my SAT.  Oh, shit. 
[00:47:30]  Wow.  Wow.  After I did abacadabra for my SAT.  A-B-A.  A-B-A-C-A-D-A.  A-B-A-C-A-T-A.  A-B-A-C-A-T-A.  Yeah, I was an idiot.  I took this SAT test.  Me and my friend was there.  So we get there.  They was like, all right, it's going to be three hours.  So you guys take your time.  Three hours?  I ain't staying until three hours.  It's Saturday.  A-B-A-C-A-D-A.  A-B-A-C-A.  That's classic.  It was a great idea until you get your scores back and everybody's in your class and they're  saying your scores out loud. 
[00:48:00]  Kevin, 622.  God damn it.  Kevin, you got a 622?  You get 400 for putting your name on the paper.  It was Saturday.  I didn't think it was that serious, guys.  I didn't really take it that serious.  Your whole future is on that one test.  A whole future.  I was totally oblivious to it.  The worst is yet to come.  This is ONA's worst of 2013.  On the Opie and Anthony channel.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013. 
[00:48:30]  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2020 news right now.  Worst of 2013.  My name is Iraq looking back at the year of Opie and Anthony for the year 2013 and all  the craziness, all the people we had in, all the dumb shit that happened.  We're looking at all of it and presenting the highlights to you in the next several days.  Right now, Anthony tells a story.  Now, look, we thought we heard a lot of the stories that Anthony had.  He had a really bizarre and cool childhood.  A lot of weird stories came out of that childhood. 
[00:49:00]  We thought we heard everything until this day when Anthony reveals a story about going  down to Tijuana with his father.  ONA's worst of 2013.  I love Mexico.  I used to, my dad used to take me to Tijuana when we used to live in San Juan Capistrano.  My dad would take me down to Tijuana and it was interesting.  I liked it.  Very colorful.  Did you buy souvenirs?  Um, no, because the second you brought money out, a bunch of kids would come running up 
[00:49:30]  and they asked you for it.  Yeah, I love it, Dad.  And then there were horses painted like zebras.  It was cool, though.  I bought a big ceramic bowl and brought it across the border.  The border guy wanted to know what was in it.  I was like, it's a piggy bank.  I just paid more attention to my dad.  He's hammered.  Would he drink into Tijuana?  Oh, would he ever.  Tequila. 
[00:50:00]  Wow.  Yeah, our Tijuana trips are legendary.  Even though he had to drive?  Oh, yeah, he didn't care.  Dad would drink and drive at the same time, like with a beer.  I remember once, he had a beer in one hand.  He had his CB mic in the other with the cord and his hand on the wheel with the CB mic.  And then he tried to make a turn and wind his hand around.  He got literally wrapped up in the CB cord and the beer started spilling and we're going  into another lane and he was hammered. 
[00:50:30]  Did you ever take his beer and dump it out the window and say, this is really irresponsible?  Oh, yeah.  Sure.  Sure.  Were you kidding?  That would have been death.  Where would he drink in Tijuana?  Like on the street or would he bring you into like scary bars?  It would be in scary bars.  Yeah, yeah.  They didn't throw you out for being young.  It's Tijuana.  And you were just a girl doing the sex show was younger than me on the stage.  How old were you?  Fantastic.  How old were you?  I was probably 13 around there.  And you just sit at the bar?  And I would just sit at the bar. 
[00:51:00]  Or if they didn't let me sit at the bar, I'd sit at a table because it was like a bar  restaurant thing.  Well, you guys would drive in, right?  And he would just drink.  Oh, yeah.  We would drive in and drive out.  Were you worried about your car getting stolen or wasn't he worried back then about getting  ripped off?  I heard in Tijuana you get ripped off for it.  No, I don't think he cared.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Dad didn't really think much about it.  You're making someone very uncomfortable on the road.  No, this is my experience in Tijuana.  She's very uncomfortable.  Oh, I know.  She's trying to figure out how the fuck to get out of here.  Why?  No, it was a lot of fun. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  But I remember it was very dangerous.  Like some of the roads through San Diego were, you know, the cliffs there and stuff.  You know, we'd be driving this truck and my dad was hammered and, you know, I'm just  looking over.  Like, I used to love red lights.  I was like, now I hate it, but I used to drive with my dad and then there'd be a red light  and it was the time where I could go.  I'd breathe again.  I could breathe a little.  I'm like, fuck.  And then like green. 
[00:52:00]  I would just tense up again for the whole fucking ride.  And I'm like leaning my body, trying to steer the truck, like away from the cliff, away  from an, like a big cement con rock truck is rumbling down the road and he's drifting  into that lane.  Because he's drinking it.  He's on his TV.  And if I even said like, dad, dad, look, look, he'd be like, I see it.  God damn it.  Tell me.  I'm like, oh God.  Oh, red light.  How far was it? 
[00:52:30]  Green.  That was terrible.  How far right was it?  It was like, uh, what's it from San Diego to, or from, it was between LA and San Diego,  Capistrano.  Like two and a half, three.  Yeah.  It was probably a couple hours.  Oh, you were taking long drives.  Oh, fuck it.  Dude.  We used to go to Lake Elsinore from Capistrano and that's over the Ortega highway.  It's like a movie road where it's just on the edge of a cliff the entire way.  And it's all windy.  And, and, and it was, it was horrifying. 
[00:53:00]  And you'd get in those lines to go through customs.  Uh, like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was going to Mexico.  Yeah.  It was, we'd get on the line to go through customs.  They wouldn't give a shit.  He'd be happy.  He'd be like, how you doing today?  And he was the one that always thought he was like the big flirter when he was drunk.  So it's like, hi, little lady.  That's what they want to hear.  Yeah.  A woman.  Is that, I remember once he was like, you've got a complexion like pieces and cream.  He said that one.  It's like, oh God, dad, stop it. 
[00:53:30]  Would you be embarrassed?  Oh, yes.  But why were you guys going down there?  It was just a week, like a Saturday thing to do.  It's lawless.  Go down there.  Yeah.  What time would you go?  It was early in the morning.  We would leave.  Oh, okay.  So we'd be there for the afternoon and part of the evening.  We'd probably head back about seven and stuff.  So it was a full day.  Back when it was dark.  Back on the cliff road.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  The dark nighttime was just a horror show.  It was just, I was tense the whole ride. 
[00:54:00]  Clutching your bowl.  Oh, it was horrible.  And by the way, it was a shift truck.  Oh, no.  So he was, and it was on the column.  That's right.  So he's driving CB, beer, shifting, trying to steer.  Old blue, the lab was in the fucking back of the truck.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  And you see, you'd have to watch him because the poor dog is ready to jump out of the truck.  It was just, it was so much anxiety for me. 
[00:54:30]  My trip to Tijuana was so much anxiety.  I love the picture of you in the bar, all creepy characters and smoky, and you're just  sitting there like a little kid.  You're just sitting there.  Yeah, you can't take it all out.  The mariachi band would be playing, and I'd just be sitting there, and Dad's at the bar  like, yeah, another tequila.  Yeah.  And I'm just sitting there, and he'd look back, what do you need, another Coke?  He'd be like, yeah.  Yeah.  People's guns sticking out of their pockets. 
[00:55:00]  Would he talk to people or interact with people?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He was very social.  Yeah, a couple of times.  Downstairs from the Franciscan.  It was a place called the Franciscan, and that was in Capistrano.  I guess we were leaving, and we had a bunch of his friends and stuff, all drunk and everything,  and he was leaving the parking garage, which was underneath the Franciscan, and his truck  blew a lot of smoke, so he stepped on the gas, and smoke blew out, and a bunch of these  tourists, and they hate it.  If you lived in Capistrano, because the swallows always come back, and they got the mission there, 
[00:55:30]  so there were tourists everywhere, and if you lived there, you hated the fucking tourists.  So he stepped on the gas, and a bunch of black smoke came out of the exhaust, and these tourists  were like, hey, you fucking asshole, fuck you, and my father's like, fuck me, fuck you,  and everyone gets out of the truck, and now I'm out of the truck, so I'm probably 14, maybe  13, 14 years old, and I'm standing there with these big drunk men and these other tourist  guys, and they're like, yeah, you fucking asshole, fuck you, fuck you, and I'm like, 
[00:56:00]  oh, Jesus Christ, so one of these guys, one of my father's friends throws his cigarette  pack at one of his other friends, and he goes, hold these, Finny, and he goes to hold them  because he's going to clock this guy in the head, and the tourist just pounded him in  the face, and one of my father's friends is down already.  You saw your dad get beat up?  No, it was one of my father's friends.  Got beat up.  He got beat up.  So then, it was on, and at that point, two guys come running after me, because I'm the 
[00:56:30]  little fucking guy.  Oh, no.  So I'm like, whoa, I'm hightailing it.  You didn't fight?  Why would I fight?  I didn't even want to be there.  There's grown-ups coming for me.  Yeah, and it was two of them.  Well, my dad turned around, I grabbed one of them, and then the other guy, like, I guess  he, you know, I ran up the stairs, and that was it, but then I went back downstairs, and  the cops were there, and they put everybody against the wall, so we're all just kind of  leaning against the wall, and I'm looking over, and my father's there, and there's Hal  Finney with his fucking eye all bloody, and I'm like, oh, this was a great night. 
[00:57:00]  We were leaving.  Hal Finney.  Hal Finney.  It was Hal Finney.  The cutters.  Yeah.  The cutters are in trouble again.  Oh, it was crazy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hal Finney's taco shop.  That ain't the name of the phone.  Hal Finney.  Taco Hut.  I haven't even thought of Hal Finney in years.  I love the fact that Hal Finney got clocked in the eye.  Hal Finney was a little bloodied.  I don't know, but it sounds like he deserved it a little bit. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, all of them did.  That's for sure.  Like his fighting prep is hold these.  I saw my dad brawl a few times.  He always did pretty good for himself.  Yeah, he never got his ass kicked.  I remember when he beat up a Mexican guy for trying to pick me up at a party.  No.  Yeah, I was hanging out at a party, and it was an outdoor at the stables and stuff, and  we were hanging out, and I was drinking some of this homebrew that they used to make,  and everybody else was, so they were pretty hammered.  So I was hanging out, and my dad was talking to his friends.  I was probably the same age, like 13, 14. 
[00:58:00]  14, 14.  Adorable.  Yeah, I was adorable.  Very molestable.  And there was this Mexican guy, and he was all kind of drunk, and he came over near  me, but with an earshot of my dad.  He goes, hey, how are you doing?  I'm like, oh, good, good, good.  And he's like, well, you know, me and you, why don't we go into the bushes over here?  Oh, my God.  And my dad came flying across the hood of a truck that we were standing next to, and  just grabbed the guy and started just pounding his face.  Wow.  And then the rest of the guys were like, because obviously he was an uncle or cousin of somebody's, 
[00:58:30]  he's like, Joey, Joey, Joey, wait, wait, wait, hold on.  He's like, this motherfucker's in.  And he's pounding, and I'm there.  What was he going to do to me in the bushes?  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, Dad, you cock blocker.  Yeah, exactly.  I was this close to being in the bushes.  Yeah, but Dad didn't want him fucking tapping into his supply.  I love that all your dad's stories, he's always very close to the truck.  Yes, he's doing it right there. 
[00:59:00]  Well, how could you drunk drive if you don't have something to drive?  Right.  So he's very close to the truck.  It's obvious your dad loved you, though.  Oh, he would not fucking.  What the fuck?  He wouldn't play.  Or he loved fighting or hated games.  Or he just didn't like that guy.  There was a lot of options there.  Or he was very scared you were going to take the Mexican up on him.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He didn't want to wait in here if I said yes.  Right, right, right.  That off of the past.  Not on my watch.  Right?  That's not exactly a good, inspiring tale of fatherly love.  You mean he didn't want you to get fucked in the mouth and the shrubs? 
[00:59:30]  Dear old dad.  He rules.  I had a lot of fun out there.  See, we got a lot of fucking Mexican stories.  And the party, by the way, at the stable, it was at Juan Reyes' stable.  You might remember Juan Reyes.  His son was Charlie Reyes, who was shot in the Mojave Desert when we were all hanging out partying.  Right.  And had to be driven to Arizona from the Mojave Desert.  You saw his friend get shot.  Oh, it was amazing.  Yeah.  Wow.  By his father.  Wow.  We were all camping out at some mining shack out in the Mojave Desert. 
[01:00:00]  And the father went to load his gun.  He had a .22.  And it was an old style one where you had to have it half cocked to spin the cylinder.  So he lifted it up before he put the hammer down on an empty cylinder.  It was a live cylinder.  And the bullet went off.  Shot his 10-year-old son, Charlie, right through the shoulder.  It went right in, like, over his heart.  And then out the back.  Jesus.  And I was looking at Charlie right at the time.  And he just went, ah.  And it looked like a water fountain of blood pumped out. 
[01:00:30]  And he just went down his knees and then down his face.  Oh, my God.  And I'm like, holy fuck.  I just saw someone get shot.  Wow.  This is crazy.  And then they all packed him into a pickup truck.  And we were in between Barstow and Needles, Arizona somewhere.  And, like, 50 miles off the main road.  We had doom buggies and guns and fucking whiskey.  It was crazy.  Desert.  See, guns are bad, Ant.  See?  No, they were great.  Guns are bad.  Guns are bad.  See?  We used to take...  We were, like, again, 14 years old.  And we would take these doom buggies out and have two people in the back. 
[01:01:00]  One driving and one in the passenger seat.  All with rifles.  And we're just shooting anything from moving doom buggies.  Yeah, it was like fucking Mad Max, the children's version.  We'd shoot any poor living thing that came across us was dead.  Jesus.  I think I shot a lizard.  I never thought the taco show would turn into this.  Oh, this is all about, you know, Southern California and me hanging out with the Mexican people.  Yeah, it's where tacos come from.  Arizona.  It was the Old Woman Mountains. 
[01:01:30]  And it was a big old silver and turquoise mine with a little mining shack.  And we used to just camp there.  It was great.  It sounds awesome.  You guys want to go to Disneyland like everybody else?  Disneyland?  You can't drink in the Magic Kingdom.  Are you crazy?  You can't let your friend Charlie get shot.  Right.  I'm going to see Charlie get shot in the Magic Kingdom?  It's a small world.  Fuck that.  What a disaster of a childhood.  Oh, it was fantastical.  It sounds fun.  It was magical.  Really.  It really sounds great.  When I think about it.  I finally came to my senses and was like, I got to go back home to my mom in New York 
[01:02:00]  because this is going really poorly.  Dad's fun, but this is wrong.  It was.  It was like fun.  But even I, at that young age, realized, wow, I'm really headed down a weird road here.  I just pictured me driving the pickup truck with a fucking Budweiser between my legs.  That CB in my hand.  With my little boy fucking tensed up with anxiety and palpitations.  Or some little boy. 
[01:02:30]  More awkward moments.  Can you turn your head and cough?  Epic fails.  That was a shitty joke that Bob.  And fouled mouth rant.  Why don't you shut the fuck up?  Coming up, Opie and Anthony's Worst of 2013 continues next.  This is Opie and Anthony's Worst of 2013.  Worst of 2013.  Worst of 2013.  My name is E-Rock at E-Rock Radio on Twitter. 
[01:03:00]  And make sure to please follow at O&A Show on Twitter.  That's the official Twitter account for the Opie and Anthony Show.  And let's move along here.  Looking back at this past year of Opie and Anthony history, Vanilla Ice is in studio.  Now, this is Vanilla Ice's first visit to the Opie and Anthony Show since the show had moved to satellite.  Joining us also is DJ WhoKid.  We didn't think Vanilla Ice was actually going to work with the show.  Would he be too corny?  Would he not fit in?  Would he not understand how the show runs?  He fit in perfectly.  He came in, had a good time, talked about his new project, the Vanilla Ice Project. 
[01:03:30]  What he's been doing since Ice Ice Baby.  And a whole lot more.  Here it is.  Vanilla Ice.  Go Ninja.  Go Ninja.  Go.  O&A's Worst of 2013.  Worst of 2013.  All right.  We pulled WhoKid out of the bullpen for this.  We went with the, are you a righty or a lefty there, sir?  I'm cool.  I'm gay, so I'm bi.  I'm bi.  I'm bi.  I'm bi.  What happened?  I'm bi at the right time.  I'm bi at the wrong time.  You know Ice, what's up, brother?  I'm bi at the wrong time. 
[01:04:00]  Sorry, Ice shit.  How are you, man?  I'm not gay.  I'm just like, you know.  Y'all getting a little friendly up in here.  I don't know where I just stepped into.  Up in here.  Up in here.  What up, Ice?  See, I got my icy watch today.  No, you didn't hear me.  I said we're going to the bullpen for this interview, and we're bringing WhoKid in to  help out.  Not that we need the help, but I thought it would be kind of nice.  It's kind of cool.  Yeah, thanks, man.  And we got Vanilla Ice in the studio, and someone just told me you remember being on our show  back in the day.  Back in the day, man.  I mean, I had a weekend that lasted a few years, but I remember that one.  Did we give you a little of this? 
[01:04:30]  No.  Why didn't you?  Oh, really?  We had a guy that was getting a lot of the guests.  Not anymore, but back then, it would have been great.  All right.  Yeah.  No, we had a guy that would bring a lot of you guys to the stairwell and give you a little  taste.  Yeah.  I didn't get that flavor.  A little taste of the reefer.  You got something?  Yeah.  No, no.  Now it's piss tests everywhere, but what are you going to do?  Yeah, what are you going to do?  That's right.  You don't use molly or nothing.  There's all this molly stuff going on around here.  Yeah, what's that?  Yeah, what is a molly?  It's ecstasy.  Oh, that's what they just call mollies?  Mollies, yeah. 
[01:05:00]  Mollies?  Man, y'all are teaching me something.  Is this a New York thing?  What is this?  I don't know.  It's like cocaine and heroin mixed, right?  Mollies?  It's ecstasy.  Oh, man, I've been away from the game too long, man.  I saw it on Twitter.  People all of a sudden talking about molly and mollies.  Rappers love ecstasy now.  Literally yesterday, I learned about ice.  We know you guys ain't on any of that, because you wouldn't be up this early in the morning  if you were.  It's all coffee now.  It's all caffeine.  That's right.  What have you been up to?  Vanilla?  Working hard, man.  Working hard, brother.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Get in where you fit in.  Make it happen.  Get in where you fit in. 
[01:05:30]  That's it, bro.  What is the Vanilla Ice Project?  Greatest show on television ever.  Yeah?  Whoa.  Yeah.  We're on season three right now, because everybody needs to be uplifted about the housing market  in America.  It's all been bad news, and we're here to spread the good news, man, is that it ain't all bad.  Really?  Live the American dream.  That's right.  And why do I have two houses in my family in foreclosure?  Because you need to renovate them and change that backsplash and stop fishing.  My dad, before he died, took out a ridiculous mortgage. 
[01:06:00]  I ain't touching that one.  I'm going to let the bank grab that one.  Hey, Obama fixed it for you.  It's called refi, Bubba.  All right.  Get up in there.  Get in where you fit in.  Yeah, we got a few foreclosures in my family.  Yeah.  Well, then maybe that's the next Ice My House Project.  Yeah?  You want to take one?  Let's come over there, man.  We got one.  The whole wall is falling in.  We'll heat it up, man.  We'll fix it up.  And the bank still isn't touching it.  It's like, what is it going to take for you guys to just take this house back?  You want them to take it.  Yes.  It's been years.  No one has paid a mortgage on it in years.  I'm sure there's a lot of listeners who'd be like, I'll take it. 
[01:06:30]  True.  True.  True that.  Yes, I did come in at the right time.  Hell, yeah.  You're making money in real estate.  Yeah, lots.  It's good.  Got some tips for us?  I got lots of tips, but I get paid for that.  Yeah, you're making money in the real estate.  How much you got?  That's Anthony, of course.  Oi.  Oh, good, man.  Nice.  Yeah, making money in real estate.  Is that it?  Absolutely.  He's talking about the Vanilla Ice Project.  Better than ever right now.  And what?  Wow.  I don't know.  That's kind of a different industry from music to real estate.  That didn't happen overnight like that. 
[01:07:00]  I didn't think so.  Yeah, yeah.  I could see you on a real estate card.  15 years I've been doing it on a real estate card.  I haven't yet to get my card, but that's a good idea.  Thanks for that.  That's funny.  I think he's doing it.  I get your card.  Are you building the houses like Jimmy Carter?  I'm still confused about this show.  I build the homes and everything.  You do?  I found another passion.  Yes.  Wow.  I use my own money.  I do it all.  I've gone up to the mansions now and everything, but I've been doing it 18 years and had great  success with it.  Now I've got my own TV show.  Like you're swinging a hammer and shit?  Yeah, I get in there and mix it up, man. 
[01:07:30]  I'm not afraid.  Yeah.  Wait, explain this show.  I'm still confused.  This show showcases all the new state of the art and home features and everything.  And I took season three.  It airs this Sunday.  Okay.  This house was set for seven years.  10,000 square foot mansion set in seven years.  A lot of them seen them in the neighborhoods, especially in Florida.  You've got a beautiful neighborhood and then you've got this one eyesore.  And then everybody's like, why don't somebody buy that?  A foreclosure, short sale.  You hear these terms.  Uh, this was a tax lien.  So I learned the strategy of how to actually acquire these homes way below the appraised 
[01:08:00]  value, which gives you a lot of room to put whatever you want into it.  Taking advantage of people.  Someone's in a bad spot.  Taking advantage of the situation.  Vanilla Ice.  Vanilla Ice.  Hey, I can't say it enough.  Comes to the door.  All right, get the fuck out.  Get the fuck out.  Get out.  We've got to be a team of corporate attorneys.  You know, either way, same process.  You must enjoy a good tax show.  You're not in the house, so there's not a kick out of the house.  You found your niche.  I like it. 
[01:08:30]  You found like what you're supposed to be doing in life.  I found a way to make it happen, man, you know.  So are you flipping houses?  Yeah, I flip house.  I've been doing that for a while.  There's a lot of money in flipping houses.  There sure is.  It's better than ever.  I mean, you can't buy a house cheaper than you can build it right now.  So it's, you know, it's the way to do it.  So you buy a house and then you do a couple things and then you sell that shit.  Well, we do a lot more than a couple things.  The other thing is we don't just put carpet and, you know, paint and flip it.  Those days are gone.  Those days were good.  They were high-teching these houses out.  We're high-teching them out.  We're making a smart house, man. 
[01:09:00]  In what way?  I love that shit.  Well, in season two, I put in a lazy river.  It takes you down through a vast landscaping of two acres.  Oh, wow.  And it goes underneath a bridge through a cave.  Got fiber optic lights in the cave.  And really cool stuff.  You sit there with your raft and you marinate, man.  You get your pina colada and you cruise around.  I like the sound of that.  But what's cool, he teaches, like, millionaires how to upgrade their houses cheaply.  So instead of, I guess, when they come in and they give you, like, a high price because  they know you're rich, they'll give you the cheaper price.  Well, we give you both prices. 
[01:09:30]  It's your option.  In Florida, you know, a lot of people don't even care what it costs.  They just want the high-tech stuff.  We got this smart house going right now.  See, I'm in the middle of, like, starting to get this shit in my house.  That's it.  I'm getting all kinds of, uh...  Like what?  Well, I'm upgrading my whole security system to include, like, where on my phone, everything.  Door locks, air conditioning and heating, lighting.  That's right.  Everything is going to be, like, automated.  Automated on your smartphone.  I love it.  And then all my cameras, you know, pan- 
[01:10:00]  That's right.  Zoom with infrared, you know, so I can see at night.  That's right.  Anywhere in the world.  All this good shit.  Yes.  You pull out your phone.  I'll switch it right up on my phone.  Say, who the fuck is at my house?  That's right.  It's like a white stuff face.  Turn those fucking lights off.  Shut the door.  I'm paying the bills here.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's true, though.  Who's getting bummed out?  That's the wave of the future, man.  This is like...  Okay, you're not going to be able to get into any of these houses anymore.  I know, man.  God damn.  How bummed are you?  That's the thing, man.  You know?  Stay out.  Give a nigga a break.  Who can Jesus give you a shot? 
[01:10:30]  Give me a chance at this shit.  Oh, man.  Vinyl Ice, you're coming over after this show, and you're going to take a look at my place  and tell me what to do.  What you need.  For free, by the way.  Give me some ice knowledge.  That's great.  That's like everybody wants this.  It's available now.  It's something that's not really...  Like, you don't have to be completely super rich and crazy to have this shit.  And I got to say...  That's right.  Prices have come down.  I got to say, it's brilliant, because you take your piece of shit house, and you make  it just cool.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Cool shit house.  Instead of having some new construction somewhere where they got all those features, Ice comes in 
[01:11:00]  and he goes, no, I'll give you the lazy rep.  That's it.  That's it, man.  I mean, we re-buy the whole house, too, you know?  All the smart stuff.  We've got electric drapes.  We've got a pneumatic elevator.  You've got everything.  You never have to look for another remote control.  You know how you have, like, five different remotes?  You're going to put the DVR on, the DVD, and you're like, which one is it?  You know, never anymore.  You throw all those remotes away, it's your phone, your smart phone.  Everything's your phone.  Everything.  You punch that up, now you've got your whole remote right there.  Thermostat.  Dude, that's my home theater.  That's it.  I want to do this.  I want to put everything on my phone. 
[01:11:30]  We'll hook you up.  That's crazy.  That way when you lose your phone, you're completely fucked.  Is there a backup?  Is there a backup in case you lose your phone?  Yeah, iCloud.  Yeah, it's on the cloud, man.  Get your ass another phone.  That's it.  Because that's your front door key.  That's your heat.  That's everything, man.  Why aren't you aging, man?  Someone's going to say it.  What the fuck's happening with this guy?  Is it the ice?  Ice does look fucking vegetarian, man.  Seven years.  You actually look clean and everything, man. 
[01:12:00]  So you're one of the pain in the ass people to go out to eat with?  Well, to be honest with you, I didn't have a choice.  I envy people who can eat whatever they want and their cholesterol stays the same.  But I ended up with the bad blood, man.  Really?  I was in the family.  I had 380 cholesterol.  I said, Doc, what do I do?  He says, you can take Crestor or Lipitor and eat whatever you want.  And I've checked it out.  And it says that it kills your liver in the long run.  It will save you from a heart attack in the short run.  It kills you from a liver.  My grandmother was telling me, my liver is only working at like 30%.  I said, I'm going to need that later.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And what do I do, Doc?  He says, go change your eating habits. 
[01:12:30]  And I did.  And it brought it down to 133.  Wow.  And you work out and shit?  Yeah, totally.  All the time, yeah.  That's pretty good.  Still doing music?  Still doing music, man.  Yeah.  What kind?  Because the last time we saw you, you were doing the hardcore metal stuff.  Yeah, with Ross Robinson, Korn, and all them guys.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hip-hop, Korn, I get in where I fit in, man.  I just, you know, I don't really have any kind of set thing.  I'm getting hyped right now, Iceman.  I'm sorry, man.  Man, that's what I do.  I bring that energy, man.  That's what's up.  Is he really?  He's our first solo white artist. 
[01:13:00]  No kidding.  Wasn't Beastie Boys like the first white group and you were the first white?  White rap, the crossover to pop radio, first pop rap song ever.  He was my Jesus Christ.  Let's not forget it, former.  Oh, yeah, of course, man.  Oh, my God.  Snow.  Snow.  That was later.  That was later.  Yeah, that was later.  That was later.  And that was the first white reggae artist, right?  It wasn't really hip-hop.  Was it really hip-hop, though?  You consider that really hip-hop?  No, that was mostly reggae, though.  Yeah, it was kind of a reggae twist.  It was like reggae, hip-hop thing.  Definitely regga, though.  Almost reggaeton. 
[01:13:30]  It was good, though.  It was good.  I still don't understand one damn word he said.  No.  But I still hum it.  So now when you go to somebody's house, do they immediately recognize you, and they're  like, oh, damn, man, that's ice.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, I shake a hand and make a friend, man.  It doesn't bother me.  And then they're like, god damn, now he's all informed about this.  Were you always into the housing thing?  No, man.  I just stumbled upon it.  But when I was young, I did Ice Ice Baby when I was 16, man. 
[01:14:00]  Wow.  You were 16 when that came out?  16.  160 million records.  Remember, dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  It changed here in the middle of the lawsuit.  David Bowen was like, fuck that shit.  It changed in the middle of the lawsuit.  We're not going to lie to you, man.  We've had fun with that clip over the years.  Oh, yeah, bro.  You're trying to explain that.  It's like, what's he doing here?  That is a great clip, man. 
[01:14:30]  No, no.  That one goes dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  Mine goes dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  It's a little bit extra dun.  Yes!  The one when I went up.  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  It's hilarious.  I forgot about that shit.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  People weren't sampling as much back then, I guess, huh?  Well, it was around.  It's just nobody really sold any records.  You know what I'm saying?  So they left you alone.  And it was weird that it was looked at like, oh, what's he doing?  Now, of course you sample shit.  But back then it was like, oh, you're ripping off that song.  It's like, no, man.  I remember after my record was out, I mean, there was like no real sample clearances. 
[01:15:00]  There was no organization, no company, nothing.  And now there's like, right across the street here, Avenue of America, there's a huge building,  sample clearances, you know?  Really?  Well, and I mean, sampling was done way before I came along.  Well, that's my question.  I want a history lesson.  What was the first sample that everyone knows?  First samples?  Does anyone know?  EPMD, maybe?  I think maybe Stetsasonic might have sampled some stuff, but it was really covered up.  But what song did they sample?  There had to be the first one.  It was usually probably Roger Troutman or Zap or something like in that era, right?  I mean, that's a lot.  A lot of rock dudes got sampled and they woke up like, uh-oh. 
[01:15:30]  Niggas are making money.  We got to get that.  That's what happened, you know?  We got to get that.  But until they made, like there was some, you know, in the hip hop community, you know,  there was a lot of successful records, but they didn't sell a lot.  So the team of lawyers, they didn't really, you know, go after it until it really sold.  The laws were probably created after he came out.  Yeah, it's like, wait, how much money?  How many records did he sell?  Yeah, yeah.  What?  There's money there.  He's using, wait, he sounds like Queen to me. 
[01:16:00]  You sold like 15 million, though, of one record, though, right?  You know, to date, 160 million.  God damn it.  You know, Eye Size Baby, to the extreme, sold almost 3 million copies just last year alone.  I mean, it helps with the TV show and being on the Adam Sandler movie and all these different things.  You get a taste of that?  A good taste?  I bought all my publishing back, man.  So you get a nice taste.  Biggest taste.  Wow, nice.  That's how I'm able to do what I do in real estate, you know?  One song.  I don't know if you want to answer that.  Two songs.  You know, I got a song that's catching that big time.  Which one? 
[01:16:30]  The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.  Oh, okay, right.  The Ninja Red.  It's so big right now, I can't even explain it to you.  Everybody knows Eye Size Baby, but I'm telling you, the generation that's out there right  now running this world grew up to the turtles, man.  Yep, right.  And they are into it.  I mean, it is huge.  They got signs.  They come dressed to my concerts like Ninja Turtles.  They jump on stage.  What?  Oh, yeah, man.  How much has the Eye Size Baby made you over the years?  Do you ever say?  I'm good.  Lots.  I'm good.  I'm financially good. 
[01:17:00]  Ridiculous number?  Ridiculous.  Yeah, I wouldn't doubt it.  But one song.  You know, it's not about money, man.  It's all about family and friends.  I can't tell you.  Listen, you ain't born with it, you're not going to buy with it.  Well, that's the thing.  If you got no family and friends to share it with, you would trade it for the family and  friends.  No, you just stay home and watch TV and you're on movie theater and screeners and you drink  a lot.  Oh, shit, that's me.  Wait a minute.  Oh, wait.  Oh, God.  And who wants to be like that?  Exactly.  Wow, man.  One. 
[01:17:30]  You never met David Bowie, though?  You and them never interacted?  Yeah, man.  Listen, I had to pay.  After the lawsuit, the lawsuit worked out in my favor because I ended up buying their  song.  Wow.  It was $4 million.  And it was one of the best investments.  I didn't know it at the time.  Wait, you own under pressure now?  Yeah.  Get the fuck out of here.  It was cheaper than, well, it was cheaper than, you know.  What?  Wait, so you own under pressure.  How about that?  That's great.  One way, Michael Jackson bought the Beatles.  How did that work out?  You know, people can buy publishing. 
[01:18:00]  Most people don't buy the publishing because after seven years, they'll take the advance  towards their publishing for another seven years.  And then you have the option to buy it right in and there.  So you said, all right, I'll give you the four mil for under pressure.  Take it.  And it was a great investment.  That is brilliant.  It was better than keep paying the, you know.  Because I've seen that show up in commercials and stuff.  Everywhere.  Yeah.  And you get that every time now.  Damn.  So it doesn't matter.  It's all cha-ching, cha-ching now.  It's it.  It's changed.  How does that part go? 
[01:18:30]  Cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching,  cha-ching, cha-ching.  That's what it sounds like now, motherfuckers.  I love it.  Holy Jesus.  Brilliant.  I know while you're sleeping, like, the ghost of, like, the gay ghost of Queen is, like,  looking at you, like, motherfucker.  Right?  I don't know if Queen is watching you right now.  They have plenty of songs of their own to hang on to.  Wow.  Who made that?  You haven't met Queen, have you?  The gay ghost.  Why'd they have to be the gay ghost?  I guess Freddie Mercury.  Yeah, of course.  Because Freddie Mercury.  You have to bring the gay.  You know, African-Americans aren't very tolerant of gay lifestyle. 
[01:19:00]  We all know that.  Why is that?  They have to be down on the DL.  No, we're cool now.  I got a gay hat on today.  You know, it's pretty gay.  It's super gay.  It's kind of gay.  It's kind of gay.  I'll be gay warm today.  And even Obama came out and said, you know, nobody didn't come out.  Wouldn't he come out soon?  But he didn't come out.  Drum roll, please.  You know, supporting gay rights and stuff?  Sure, man.  But you got the Biggie shirt on.  That's cool.  You know, I keep representing.  That's it.  It's like gangster and gay. 
[01:19:30]  GG.  You know what I'm saying?  Double G'd out, man.  That's dope.  It's like ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  So you now officially own that.  That's great.  And I'm not embarrassed to say I copied his dance moves.  I think every black kid copied his dance moves.  You know that, right?  Was that right?  Every black kid copied that.  You still remember him?  What?  The back and forth?  That was like, yeah, yeah.  That shit was fucking righteous.  That was hard right there.  What was O'Neay doing when this song was out?  What were y'all doing?  What year is that now? 
[01:20:00]  91.  No, I'm trying to remember.  I'm not even being a dick.  91.  Wow, 91 already.  Doing drugs and bad-mouthing your country.  I was doing radio in, where the fuck?  Buffalo, I guess.  I was working construction on Long Island.  I didn't play a record.  I was at a rock station.  You guys were, I remember, and then you came to New York shortly after.  Wow.  And then I came in there, and then I think you had some issues, legal issues yourself.  Yeah, there were a couple of things that happened.  I remember some stuff, too.  Yeah, it happens, you know. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, we got fucking.  Made us bigger.  That's it, though.  The lawyers told us, fucking dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  Your ass out the fucking door.  That's it.  You ain't buying shit.  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  Hit your ass on the way out, motherfucker.  Yeah, you ain't buying shit.  I love it.  Yeah, you ain't buying your way out of this one.  Nope.  Ah, shit, man.  You guys are too much, man.  I love it.  That's great.  What a friggin' different lifestyle, man.  You figured it out.  I don't know, man.  That's fantastic.  Day by day.  Day by day.  You're loving doing a TV show?  Yesterday's history, tomorrow's a mystery, man. 
[01:21:00]  Just take it day by day.  Whoa, man.  Love life.  Put the meme out of that.  That's it, brother.  Jesus Christ.  Don't panic.  Tomorrow hasn't happened yet.  What else about the show?  You got Lazy Rivers and you got the smartphone stuff.  Oh, I got a panoramic gaming room with a 200-inch screen that comes all the way.  It wraps around you.  Whoa.  Okay?  What?  And you sit on this big vibrating chair, you put on the 3D glasses, and it's a gaming  room.  That's like totally immersed.  It is.  I mean, it really comes to life.  It's surround sound, and it's got subwoofers, but it's got some kind of vibrating thing underneath 
[01:21:30]  the chair that'll actually, if you hit something, it'll kick you in the ass.  Yeah.  It'll thump you, man.  I like that whole wraparound and 3D.  Jeez, that's got to look great.  It's like you're in it.  I built the world's first IMAX home theater.  IMAX at home?  At home.  Look at me, I'm a piece of shit with a regular fucking...  What is that, a couple of Gs?  Yeah.  Couple of two, huh?  Yeah.  Couple of two.  Perhaps more than that.  They're saying we've got to wrap up, but we've got to like...  Oh, man, you're busy today, huh? 
[01:22:00]  You're all over the place.  Getting everybody to tune in for Sunday, man.  That's great.  You and the Who Kid for the Instagram.  A lot of...  You and the Who Kid.  Hold on, that video.  Hold on, man.  Hold on.  I'm fucking this shit up.  A lot of guys...  All right, hold on.  Here we go.  Finally.  One, two, three.  You know, a lot of guys would have rested on their laurels there.  I don't know what's going on.  Goddamn, you know, just raking in that money and fucking...  But you found a good niche for yourself and you're doing all right.  Hey.  I like that.  You got to find a passion and run with them.  I don't like seeing these true Hollywood stories where they end up tragic, you know? 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, well, they're entertaining as well.  I mean, we all loved...  Who didn't love...  I'm sure you guys had a fun day with it, with Britney Spears shaving her head and going crazy.  Oh, yeah.  Come on.  You know what the thing is, is that, like, you know, I did...  I had a transitional period, like I said.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  A weekend that lasted a few years.  But, you know, you got to figure out your purpose in life and where you belong in.  And I can't wait to watch what Bieber goes through, you know?  Yeah, right.  It's going to be some shit.  It's going to be some shit.  Why is that?  Hopefully he gets...  The fame just gets crazy?  Because you're used to living this huge artificial life, being on stage in front of all these  people all the time, every night. 
[01:23:00]  And then when it stops, you got to get back into reality.  Man.  And that's the part where everybody loves to tune in and watch.  It's very entertaining, you know?  That's the entertaining part.  Train wreck.  You just watch him fall off the fucking pedestal.  Horrible for the person living it, great for the people watching.  Yeah, yeah.  We never got that big, so we're good.  Exactly.  Exactly.  We almost were there.  We were almost there a few times.  Almost.  Almost.  Yeah, we threw ourselves off the pedestal before anyone put us there.  Yeah, yeah.  We're like, fuck this.  Yeah.  Holy shit, man.  Hey, fuck it.  What are you...  Ice?  You just go buy ice, right? 
[01:23:30]  Rob.  My mom called me Rob.  Yeah, Rob.  I respond either way.  I like that.  It's pretty cold outside, but I'll take ice.  Yeah, all right.  I thought he'd be icy.  Ice.  I got my jewelry on.  Look, I want all my ice today.  Oh, man.  I got an ice ring on my dick.  I had no intention of watching your TV show.  I'm going to watch that.  I had no intention, but now I'm going to check it out.  The keyboard's head, right?  There you go.  So now we've inspired you.  I'm just being honest with you.  Who cares?  We'll do an interview with him.  We'll have fun.  We'll remember him from N.E.W., but I'm going to watch the show.  Gives you great ideas for stuff you want to do to your house, too, man. 
[01:24:00]  It's the DIY Network.  It's called the Vanilla Ice Project.  Come back and see us, man.  I sure will, man.  I will.  Thanks for having me on the show, guys.  Great to see you.  The worst is yet to come.  This is so fucked up, man.  This is ONA's Worst of 2013.  On the Opie and Anthony channel.  Yeah, this is Opie and Anthony's Worst of 2013.  Worst of 2013, Opie and Anthony show.  My name is Erock, and looking back at the year that was for the Opie and Anthony show, 
[01:24:30]  in this segment here, we're looking at the Patrice O'Neill tribute show.  It's the first annual Patrice O'Neill tribute show that happened this past February, and this is a discussion about everything that's going on for this benefit, what it's going to do, who's going to be a part of it.  We had some great comedians in studio telling stories about Patrice, like Colin Quinn, Bob Kelly, David Tell, Jim Norton in studio as well, and we miss Patrice.  Who doesn't miss Patrice? 
[01:25:00]  If you're not fortunate enough to have heard Patrice the first time around, go over to iTunes.  Go and download all that stuff, and proceeds from those sales go to benefit Patrice's family.  Side note, if you go to ONA show on Twitter or our Facebook page, there's information about the second annual Patrice O'Neill tribute show that's happening in February.  If there's still tickets available, you best go and buy them right now.  This is ONA's Worst of 2013.  On the Opie and Anthony channel.  We got Bill Burr in studio and Colin Quinn in studio, and they just entertained the hell out of us for the last ten minutes. 
[01:25:30]  Look, what else you have in the studio? The other celebrity, Adam Durwitz.  Sam in the corner.  Of course, the big Patrice O'Neill benefit today.  That's why Bill Burr is in town.  That's why Colin Quinn's in studio.  It's going to be a great night.  No tickets available, obviously, right?  I don't think so.  No, there's a few that are going to be released.  It's one of those things where they release them last minute.  We had to save some for family and friends and that type of stuff. 
[01:26:00]  Those people didn't show up, so now they release comps.  Patrice insulted all of them, so they're like, I don't want to come to it.  There's going to be very few, but they're going to be released.  Do they go to the box office at the New York City Center?  You know, I have that information somewhere in my phone here.  I was supposed to have all of that.  They'll figure it out.  Maureen's going to kill me.  I don't like the fact that Bill Burr actually put a whole thing together that kind of worked at the city center.  You know what?  I love it, and I love that it bugs Colin.  I love that he probably lays at night staring at his awful ceiling. 
[01:26:30]  But everything bugs Colin.  I don't even know what doesn't.  It needed to be painted for ten years.  I've got to get Colin shaving cream from fucking Arthur's father.  No, I mean, why is it the Manelli's time?  Oh, no.  It doesn't matter because I literally kept this on today because I know my facial hair really bugs no...  You have my permission to marry him.  What doesn't bug you, Colin?  Pretty much everything bugs you.  Joy.  Joy bugs Colin. 
[01:27:00]  What doesn't bug me?  Racial equality, people getting along.  That is nice.  The new society we live in, that kind of thing I enjoy.  That first day of spring.  Oh, good one, Bill.  Oh, that is good.  Colin's had a lot of observations just sitting here.  Yeah.  Bill's talking about a business model.  You went after him.  We're bitching about live reads.  You're going after us.  I was literally just answering a question.  Why would that be unusual from what happens on the show every day? 
[01:27:30]  True.  Isn't it what we do is go after whoever's talking?  Tell us how you really feel.  All right.  That's a good one.  Who's emceeing?  Voice?  Yes.  Oh.  Nice.  Did that fucking weasel get himself the host job?  I'm telling you, I'm a good host.  I'm telling you.  Keep it moving.  Keep it moving.  Keep it moving.  I like the fact, did you see Bill's response?  They can't teach you 20 years of acting school.  Like, who's hosting, boss?  He goes, yes. 
[01:28:00]  No, it's because I already know guys are going to be bitching about the lineup.  Dad, why am I going here?  Fucking blah, blah, blah.  That's why I haven't told anybody, like, the lineup.  I'm not dealing with it.  Tell us the lineup now.  Talk to Maureen.  Oh, the lineup.  Tell us the lineup now.  Colin, you are going first and last.  Whoa.  Oh, look at you.  Going to best parts.  I hope you don't.  I have to get up very early, so I can't go.  Oh, well.  Listen, I got to get out of here.  I don't know about you guys.  I got to get out of here.  I do get up at 5.30.  I hope that's considered. 
[01:28:30]  I hope that's taken into consideration.  I just figured I'll pass the hat around.  We'll do a little potluck thing.  You know, just be a bonding moment.  Be a bonding moment.  Oh, my God.  I could draw straws.  Patrice benefits.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bill won't give us the lineup.  He says we're going to do it.  Bill won't give us the lineup.  We're going to tag team it.  That's what we're going to do.  Tag team.  Just boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, all the way down.  I thought the voice was hosting.  We're going to start.  No.  Maybe he is.  I can't remember.  Oh.  I'll speak to Maureen.  You speak to Maureen.  That's the way to go.  Yeah, you better talk to her.  Maureen put it. 
[01:29:00]  See, Bill put it together.  But then he needed Maureen to bring it home.  Yeah.  Comedians can't do this kind of stuff on our own.  He just can't stand it.  He just can't stand that I did something good.  I don't know what it is.  Yeah, what's wrong with you, Carl?  My heart was in the right place.  I knew there was things that I couldn't handle.  I delegated power.  No, I think it was great.  I did a great thing.  And I just don't understand what you have against benefits.  I have nothing against benefits.  I do hate benefits.  I'm not friends with benefits.  Oh.  Don't get dirty.  Come on.  He has a problem with this bill. 
[01:29:30]  Carl?  Nobody wants to get an email from me.  Why?  You're doing a good thing.  You're doing a good thing.  I enjoy a good Bill Burr email.  They're fun.  Yeah.  They're nice.  Like one of my pals say.  You know how long it took me to construct each email trying to figure out what the other  in nine comics, how they were going to attack me?  Really?  That's a lot of stress.  Colin was probably the most consistent.  Right.  Keith was probably the meanest.  What, they just write you back?  All sorts of crap?  All right, stupid. 
[01:30:00]  It's just like.  Even for a benefit.  Even for a really nice thing.  It just never ends with you guys.  Oh, and then, yeah.  And then the planning of it.  You couldn't call anybody.  The second you bring it up.  Yeah, listen to what we're going.  Dude, this is what you should do, dude.  You should start with a cake, and then we'll have a slideshow.  I got a buddy of mine.  He's got a wireless cupcake store.  And then I got to fucking deal with all that.  So I try to keep each email as informative and with as little shit as possible. 
[01:30:30]  Right.  And then this asshole, Colin, would be like, even in your emails, you're ice cold and a  non-feeling human being.  He just started really breaking me down psychologically.  That's what I've been dealing with.  What a nightmare.  Oh, I have a whole new fond of respect for people who do this shit.  Yeah.  Well, the important thing about tonight's benefit, Bill did do a great job, and it's  not one of those benefits where there's too many people on the show or anything like  that.  Oh, my God. 
[01:31:00]  He just can't do it.  I love Colin.  This guy cannot do it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  Who's on it?  It's obviously Keith, Colin.  Colin is going first, and he's going last.  And last.  And I'm going to make him read announcements.  We're trying to fill in the lineup.  We got most of them, I think.  Yeah.  Bill, Colin.  Keith, Rich.  Keith, Rich, me.  Bobby, Will Silvins.  Who are we missing?  Ian Edwards.  Marita Franklin.  Will Silvins.  Oh, Will's making it.  Okay, good.  Rich Voss.  I think that was everybody. 
[01:31:30]  That's a lot.  I think she should make Boss MC.  You know what?  We will take that into consideration.  I'll speak to Maureen.  I've got her email.  Absolutely.  There's another thing, too.  Trying to get photos from these jackasses.  We're such morons.  We all knew each other 20 years.  You get some blurry photo from, like, fucking 1998 with half a face on it.  Sorry, dude.  This is all I got.  Trying to put this thing.  I will never fucking do something like this again.  Fucking.  But it makes Colin happy. 
[01:32:00]  Keith Robinson sent a photo in.  It looked like somebody had poured milk on it.  Like, fucking 20 years ago.  And I just wrote back.  I'm like, really?  Ah, you know, I'm a player.  Player.  I don't know.  That's all I got.  Who was the most responsible with the pics?  Huh?  Did I not get you photos immediately?  Jim Norton.  Immediately.  Superstar, right?  Superstar Jim Norton.  I have not said one negative thing about Jim.  Bob Kelly got some really good pictures of us from Brazil.  Bill, he has a bunch that he showed me. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah, man.  Fucking.  He sent me a couple recently.  You got to do a benefit every year just to make Colin happy.  Because it seems to make him very happy.  I'd love to do it.  I'll do it.  I'll do it every, like, year, year and a half.  And it'll give him yet another reason to trash me.  It'll be like your sort of second Christmas every year.  Why are you trashing Bill, Colin?  Look, I wouldn't be able to do that.  I couldn't believe he was doing it.  False modesty.  I couldn't believe he was.  I was getting emails from Bill going, okay, guys, this is really happening.  We're doing it this way.  I was kind of impressed. 
[01:33:00]  But it was still funny because I knew what he was dealing with.  Because I knew he was dealing with me.  I knew everybody else was there.  So it wasn't really kind of a hassle.  We know that, stupid.  I'm sorry.  I said something funny, and it annoys you.  It wasn't funny.  It was just pompous and righteous.  It isn't.  It was annoying.  Colin hates me.  Why do you hate Bill?  I love Bill Burr.  Colin has hated me since day one.  Really?  The man.  It's not true.  I'm fucking around.  Look how he loves it.  He's like, really?  He just loves hitting people against each other.  What's wrong with that?  You lazy motherfucker.  What's wrong with that?  You lazy motherfucker. 
[01:33:30]  He's right, he's lazy.  He just, let's let these guys argue.  That'll take ten minutes up.  No, you know what?  Go ahead, point guard.  Come up with another subject.  There's something wrong with that.  How about the Jews?  Oh, Chip.  Oh, Tippi.  You see his eyes light up?  That's good stuff.  His eyes light up.  Bill's in a bad mood.  Are you in a bad mood?  He's trying to turn it around on me.  I'm in a great mood.  How can we tell?  I'm in a great mood.  How can we tell?  I'm in a great mood. 
[01:34:00]  He's annoyed.  I caught him.  I'm not annoyed.  I can tell.  You're holding your wrist.  You look annoyed.  You're fucking killing it.  Setting the pace for everybody.  Everyone else.  It was a monster show.  It really was.  Yeah.  It reminded me of the virus shows without all the hoora and the alcoholism.  And the meat.  I tried to bring that.  I tried to bring that part of it.  Somebody said backstage that was the first time you guys all did it since the virus, really. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  It's the first time we've all been together since then.  Yeah.  And it was kind of sad at one point.  I was like, because I remember those shows.  And I remember me and Patrice always had the same locker room.  You guys always put us together.  Oh, yeah?  For some reason.  And, you know, yapping to him.  And then, Voss, I'm anxious.  I think it's going to be good.  Yeah.  I didn't take my anxiety medicine.  It was funny.  It was 8 o'clock.  But he kept saying how he was suffering from anxiety.  And then he's telling me and Ant to give him a really nice intro. 
[01:35:00]  You know?  And then he proceeds to trash us.  I'm like, really?  Because it's Voss.  I know.  No, but he wanted desperately the real nice intro.  Oh, you gave him the line?  I gave him the line.  What was it?  The lesbian and the...  The lesbo and the doomsday prepper.  That was pretty goddamn funny.  It is funny.  Why would you give that to Voss, you bastard?  Yeah, what are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  It was a great night, though.  You guys coming out.  Oh, it was fucking amazing.  And everything went flawless.  Everybody kind of stuck to their time.  And the only thing that sucked about going up front is that they were really on me. 
[01:35:30]  Fucking, you know, do your time.  Yeah?  I was just panicking.  I was just panicking.  I was just watching the...  Like, fucking...  All right.  I got to fucking...  Because what happens is when you get to your time, it switches, turns red.  We were talking about this.  We were talking about that.  That's the...  I have been an asshole for two and a half minutes.  Yeah.  It's just red and it's going, one, dickhead.  Two, fuck off.  Three, get off, you piece of shit.  Five, Patrice is dead and you're fucking his memory. 
[01:36:00]  But, uh...  It was great.  Yeah, it was a great night.  And everybody killed, too.  It always sucks when somebody...  No one had a bad set.  Nobody.  One person had a bad set.  I really was hoping Keith Robinson would take a hot one just to teach him a lesson.  Damn it.  No, he...  God damn it.  He killed it.  He did.  I haven't seen Ian Edwards in so long.  He was really funny.  And then, you know, I've seen Bill and Bobby a million times.  But Ian, I don't see anymore because he lives out in L.A.  And we used to work together all the time at the Boston Comedy Club.  He used to have dreads.  He's bald now.  Did you know Ian before? 
[01:36:30]  Yeah, I knew him from back in the day.  One of the best Pete Correale stories ever with Ian Edwards.  Yeah.  What?  He was on stage talking about his dowry.  Like, you know, African couples have a dowry and they were like, yeah, you have to give  them cattle.  And Pete Correale went, cattle?  It just came out and he heard them, but he thought it was an audience member at the old  Boston.  And he went, yeah, motherfucker.  What do you think they used before they had money?  And Pete went, you. 
[01:37:00]  That's fucking good.  Yeah, it was a great show, man.  Everybody killed it.  It was.  What's up with the posters that everyone's talking about?  Oh, yeah, they sold great, first of all.  Can you guys print more or no?  No, you print, huh?  Limit and run because it's a work of art.  It's not just a poster.  We went to Staples or Kinko's and had, we had the artist, Tyler Starr, donated the image.  He made the image.  He's a fan of Patrice.  He came up with two versions. 
[01:37:30]  And then they, you know, they hand silkscreen each one.  And then he signs them and he numbers them.  So there's only 300 of the purple.  There was 100 of the gold.  We sold a lot of the gold.  We sold a lot of them last night, but we also signed five each.  So there's five gold, five purple that are going to be coming out this week on an auction  that are signed by everybody who did the show.  And then the rest of them are going online on the same page.  So at Danny J. Ross and me and Billy and Norton, you guys will be tweeting out when they 
[01:38:00]  go online.  Dot com.  The website.  All that dot com.  Dot com.  W-W-W.  No, what was it?  Danny J. Ross dot com.  Can you try that, Sam?  Danny J.  What is it?  Danny J. Ross.  At Danny J. Ross.  Okay.  I like them both.  Oh, you were doing it as a website, I thought.  Now I'm confused.  What's going on, Sam?  Just go to Patrice O'Neill dot big cartel dot com.  Yeah.  Oh, where the fuck did Big Cartel?  All right, we'll put that on the Facebook page.  Right.  Opie and Anthony on Facebook will have the same phone.  Right now it says they're sold out, but I think that's just because Danny hasn't. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah, they're not sold out.  Not many are left yet.  We have some purple and some gold left, and then the five and five signed by all of us,  so they'll be coming out.  So get them.  We autographed them.  Oh, I see.  Fucking Voss last night.  I'm like, everybody walks in, I go, just don't sign on the art and make it small.  Oh, boy.  Boom, boom, boom.  He comes in, first one, right over the fucking image.  No.  Right on the rocket.  I'm like, I said don't sign on the fucking art.  What a dope.  On the rocket?  Yeah, right on the edge of the rocket.  At least it wasn't on Patrice. 
[01:39:00]  I had to fucking yell at him every signature just to make him shake so he'd sign it correctly.  Dolt.  What a dope.  That one's worth more money now.  Voss's name on the rocket.  It's the exact opposite of what he's on in show business.  He's signing an anchor.  Ah, shit.  Yeah, those images were really fucking well made, man.  I like them a lot.  It's real artwork.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Yes, indeedy.  David Tell, how are you, sir?  Good, man. 
[01:39:30]  How's it going, guys?  Good seeing you last night.  Yes.  That was a big, amazing benefit.  I thought it was great.  Very cool.  You know, I've done a lot of these, and I have to tell you, that was the biggest, best produced,  just all around great benefit I've ever seen.  It really was, man.  It was all the fans of Patrice and, of course, all the comics.  That was just an amazing turnout.  Everyone did very well.  There wasn't one bomb.  Nope.  I was a little sappy, but I thought it was all pretty straight up, and it was a long  show, too.  It didn't feel like a long show.  Except for Will's poem. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, Black Star, Black Star.  I want a T-shirt.  Black Star, Black Star, Black Star.  I want Black Star, Black Star, Black Star.  Black Star.  Black Star.  Where are you?  Black Star?  The best part was when his iPhone turned off.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was Patrice.  Did you see that?  I was upstairs.  It fucks up the whole pacing.  If you're going to do a poem, you can't have your iPhone turn off in the middle of it  and go to the audience, wait, I got to turn my phone back on or reset it or whatever  the fuck he said.  He didn't write it down.  He didn't write Black Star down.  I want to hear the poem again. 
[01:40:30]  Black Star, Black Star.  Oh, God.  I was walking.  I wasn't even in the show.  I was upstairs, and I just walked by a speaker and heard Black Star, Black Star.  I was like, what the fuck?  I'll be in my tracks.  What?  Yeah.  What the fuck is he doing?  Well, at the end of his set, and he had a great set, too, he decided he needed to read  something for Patrice that he wrote.  Shout out.  A little shout out.  It was.  Was Patrice the Black Star?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  We got that much.  Because it got a little confusing there.  Now, I wonder if we could get Will in to do that as those two guys go down on each 
[01:41:00]  other.  Oh, wow.  There you go.  If we would have had a tsunami of awkward.  We hadn't gotten rid of all the gay, you know.  Let's get Will on the phone and do Black Star.  Go ahead.  Black Star, Black Star.  Oh, God.  Maybe not.  If anyone could get a hold of Will, tell him to call us.  There's no...  Nobody can...  Poetry sucks.  It does.  We hate poetry.  It just sucks.  It stinks.  They were doing a...  Liz at the Comedy Cellar, who's the best, they were doing a farewell party.  She's like the assistant manager there, or the manager, whatever.  And some girl from the underground got up and read a poem. 
[01:41:30]  Fucking poetry.  Poetry stinks.  This is what Keith...  She did it without a microphone, and she got a laugh on one of the first lines.  And then Keith made her say it again, because he got a microphone.  He goes, do it again.  He made her do the first over.  So it was like telling the same joke twice in front of the same audience.  Did he get another laugh?  She got nothing.  Oh.  Did he get another purpose?  Yeah.  And then it went downhill from there.  Keith Roberts.  Say it again.  Say it again.  She was like, no, no, no.  Say it again.  They don't like it.  Nothing.  What was the joke, you know? 
[01:42:00]  Oh, I forget.  It was just rhymed.  It was a quirky rhyme.  And it was terrible.  It just went downhill.  I like my poems to rhyme, though.  I do, too.  You need them to rhyme.  You need them to rhyme at least.  If it's all rhyming, it ain't a poem.  Let's at least rhyme those poems.  What do you want to say?  Oh, yeah.  Sir.  Yeah.  It gets worse.  This is hilariously bad.  More of Opie Anthony's Wars in 2013.  2013.  2013.  Coming up.  Must share moments.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013. 
[01:42:30]  Continues.  Worst of 2013.  For the Opie and Anthony show.  My name is Iraq.  And this show tends to have some weird crossovers, weird parallels, and weird sagas.  This is one of those times.  This is the Penn Jillette-Trace Adkins saga for Celebrity Apprentice, starting with part  one here, where Penn Jillette came into studio.  He's promoting his brand new ice cream flavor in order to win, because he's a finalist in  Celebrity Apprentice.  And all the money that he wins goes to his charity of choice. 
[01:43:00]  So he comes in, talks about what's going on with Celebrity Apprentice.  We try his ice cream, and we catch up with our good friend, Penn Jillette.  The worst of 2013.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Penn Jillette outside the studio.  And Roland just handed us ice cream.  Yeah, I normally wouldn't eat ice cream this early in the morning, but I'm going to have  a couple of bites.  Hi, Penn.  How you doing, my friend?  Good to see some friendly faces.  Absolutely.  What's up, Penn?  I'm going to try out some of this ice cream here.  You better.  The ice cream looks all right, brother.  It's really good.  It's really good. 
[01:43:30]  Look at the packaging.  My God.  Oh, my God.  Will this actually be in stores?  What do you mean, will it be?  It's in stores now.  Oh, sorry.  Penn, you know, we've already bought several cartons.  That's what we're supposed to say.  This is so creamy and delicious.  It's creamy and good, and it's mine.  Oh, look at the chocolate in here.  Oh, my God.  I'll have a couple of bites.  I've been on a good diet, but I have to try it.  It would be impolite.  Oh, my God.  Ice cream is so good. 
[01:44:00]  I'm going to have such gassers on the plane today, too, because lactose does that to me.  That's my main motivation, trying some ice cream.  Oh, no, that's right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jimmy goes, yeah.  What's the story behind the ice cream?  Well, you know, I'm on this television program called Celebrity Apprentice.  Yes, we do know that.  And the final task, because I'm a finalist, you know?  And last time I was here, I was already a finalist, but I kept it from you.  I know you did.  I did.  I kept it from you.  We tried to get it out of you, too.  I know.  I know.  But you knew in your heart.  Yeah, we did.  You're like Nixon. 
[01:44:30]  You know in your heart he's right.  How good is the ice cream?  Oh, my God.  So we had a design for Walgreens, or as it is in New York, Duane Reade.  We had a design in ice cream.  And Trace went with carpet fibers and shit as his flavor.  And I went with this rich vanilla ice cream with sea salt chocolate and fudge caramel candy pieces.  It's all about the sea salt, sir.  This is amazing.  Yes, it is.  And that's my idea.  Sea salt has taken over the world. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah, that's pretty good.  You just won.  I just nailed it.  I think I did, yeah.  Right when you said that, I got a taste of the chocolate with the sea salt.  Who would think that would be good with ice cream?  It is.  Penn Jillette.  Exactly.  Celebrity apprentice.  That's the answer.  You're also a magician with ice cream, my friend.  And it's $100,000 to whoever sells the most ice cream to our charities.  I thought per carton.  And it would be a bargain at that, wouldn't it?  Wait, I've got to ask one question before I endorse your ice cream.  Does the other guy have peanut butter in his ice cream? 
[01:45:30]  No.  Oh, I hate peanut butter.  I'm all in.  I'm all in.  He has macadamia maple.  Oh, really?  No, that's terrible.  That's a good reaction.  That is it.  This is all American.  When I said carpet fibers and shit, you went, yeah.  When I say macadamia maple, no.  Ew.  You know, and my charity is a charity, Opportunity Village in Vegas.  It's kind of a David and Goliath thing.  Because he's got, you know, I was hoping he would go for American Nazi Party.  Right.  But instead, he went for Red Cross. 
[01:46:00]  Oh, okay.  Which is a fine charity.  But, you know, $100,000 to a local charity in Vegas that helps people with intellectual disabilities get jobs.  Right.  Is huge.  You know, $100,000 to the Red Cross.  It's like, ah, fuck you.  $100,000.  Yeah, yeah.  We got that up our ass.  So, you know, I'm hoping.  And I've been eating this ice cream, you know, because I go on shows.  Yeah.  You know, and I eat the ice cream for show, but I still end up eating it.  I love it.  It's so good.  And I mean this very sincerely.  That might be the best ice cream I've ever eaten.  I'm not being polite because you're here. 
[01:46:30]  Well, thank you.  That is fucking amazing.  Did you actually come up with this?  Yes.  You're a winner.  That's the nutty thing about Celebrity Apprentice.  Because I don't know it's real with that shit.  Well, no.  Most of Celebrity Apprentice is just real.  They don't read stuff behind the camera.  They don't do retakes.  All that stuff I've done on every other show, they don't do.  Is there a way I could bet on the winner?  Because you got this.  You got this.  Okay.  Well, good.  You know, I hope so.  I hope so.  Hold on.  I had a second question.  So you came up with this, right?  Yeah.  It's an amazing flavor.  Jimmy's saying it's the best ice cream you've ever eaten. 
[01:47:00]  I really mean it.  I can't stop.  Does freaking Donald Trump own this ice cream now, or do you got a piece of the action?  I have a piece of the action after a year.  Oh!  No one's going to care in a year.  Hey, don't say that.  Please, don't say that.  There's going to be another ice cream in a year.  You just throw me away.  Discard me like you're cum-filled socks in the bottom of the bed, don't you?  I'm looking out for you.  Oh, that Donald Trump is tough is what I'm getting at.  You come up with this amazing flavor, and you don't get the action until a year from now. 
[01:47:30]  This has longevity.  Yeah, people will come back for this.  You think it has longevity?  Plus, Penn's famous enough to go out and promote it yourself after.  It's like...  You are famous, Penn.  Well, thank you.  You're very famous.  You look thinner, too.  Oh, my God.  I'm thinner and famous.  They go together.  Look at Angelina Jolie.  And, yeah, so I'm a finalist.  I'm a finalist on the show.  Congrats.  Congrats.  You got this.  Me and Trace.  We don't know.  I think it should be very, very close.  But the funny thing is, every other year, most of the years, they've had real animosity 
[01:48:00]  with the two finalists.  Right.  And Trace and I get along great.  You get along, yeah.  Yeah.  Get along wonderfully.  Because, you know, why would there be animosity on a television show?  But there sometimes is.  Yeah, well, people get very competitive.  We're competitive.  We're doing the best we can.  I think sometimes they make drama, you know?  You guys get along, though?  Hmm?  Very well.  You're performers.  Yeah.  This ice cream is ridiculous.  I gave mine to Sam.  I ate, like, fucking five bites.  It's crazy.  You're not going to get mad if I throw this away. 
[01:48:30]  Because I can't eat this whole fucking thing.  Give it to, like, Roland.  It's too good.  Give it Roland to eat it.  It's so goddamn good.  Wow.  And it's only until Saturday that it counts.  I've gotten to the salt part.  You know, there's a bunch of...  Every Walgreens, every Duane Reade has it.  I suggest very strongly you not even try his flavor.  Yeah.  And if you try his flavor, it doesn't help me at all.  Let me tell you something.  Don't try his flavor, because the guy hasn't come on our show.  He doesn't come on your show?  No.  It's all about Penn Jillette. 
[01:49:00]  Good.  Don't even try the other flavor.  Just buy Penn's ice cream.  That's like in macadamia maple.  It sounds terrible.  Yeah, well, I don't care for it, but some people do.  Miple's only good on pancakes.  That's a niche.  That's it.  That's a niche flavor.  This is a flavor for the people.  This is universal.  This is the people's flavor.  You got your vanilla and your chocolate right in there.  It's all American.  You are...  It's...  Dude, that's so goddamn good.  I'm tempted to just keep eating this.  I never really eat ice cream.  I'm sea-salting my ass off right now.  That's fucking amazing. 
[01:49:30]  Look at this shit.  All right.  One more big fucking spoonful.  How does he compete?  That other one sounds awful.  Yeah, well, you know...  It sounds terrible.  It would be nice to win.  If I do not win, if I do not bring home the bacon for O&A, will you still love me?  Yes.  I'll like you more if you lose, because I'll relate to you.  Oh, by the way, on Penn Sunday School, for those who listen, this Sunday is Jim  Oh, good, good, good.  Because I'll be here doing Celebrity Apprentice.  We're rolling that in now. 
[01:50:00]  So you'll be on.  That was a really good show.  I understand why you have him on here.  Yes.  He's good all the time.  Thank you.  You finally have an understanding of why we have this guy on here.  Sam, you're enjoying your ice cream?  It's delicious.  When is the finale for Celebrity Apprentice?  This weekend?  Sunday, yeah.  Okay.  So we're right there now.  And that's live?  Yeah.  Oh, it is.  Okay.  Well, they do a...  They roll in about...  It's a two-hour show.  They roll in about an hour.  And then we come out and they try to get us to, I guess, you know, arm wrestlers. 
[01:50:30]  How hard is it not to tell people you're a finalist?  You know, um...  You had to keep that quiet for how long?  Four or five months?  What if my...  In my skill set, keeping secrets is there.  That is true.  He's a fucking magician.  That is true.  Oh, fuck me, man.  You know, I could also...  I could deliberately mislead you if I wanted.  I didn't even have to do that.  But you did.  You know, and the NBC says to me, you know, this is very important that you keep...  I go, yeah, we catch bullets in our teeth.  I can...  I think I can handle this. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah.  I talk an awful lot, but you'd be surprised at how much I'm shutting up.  How little you say.  Yes.  I don't give you the hints when I'm not supposed to.  No idea.  And I do want to say, because this is something I...  Is that my charity, Opportunity Village, which is what you'll be buying the ice cream for  at Walgreens, Dwayne Reed, it was Elvis' favorite charity.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You know the scarves that Elvis used to take off his neck and wipe his brow and kiss and  throw on...  Every single one of those was made at Opportunity Village. 
[01:51:30]  Opportunity Village, you know, people with intellectual disabilities, gives them jobs, helps them get  jobs in the community, but they also had a workshop that just made Elvis scarves.  So, as I said to Mr. Trump, and I will say again on the finale, I said, you know, if you're  not for me, you're against my charity.  And if you're against my charity, you're against Elvis.  And if you're against Elvis, sir, fuck you.  What else could he say?  Yeah, he used to...  Every one of the scarves that he would take. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I have one of the scarves.  And the women would go crazy.  One of the real Elvis ones.  Oh, you do?  Yeah.  The guy would put...  Who is that would put it on his back?  Elvis would throw one out, and then someone would drape one on his back.  Yeah, yeah.  Put a new one on.  I forget the guy's name.  The women would go wild.  With the Beatles, you know everybody in the band, George Martin, everything.  With Elvis, there's just Elvis.  Just Elvis.  Maybe Scotty Moore.  Maybe you know the guitar player.  But if you say to somebody, you know, who's Elvis' favorite drummer?  No idea.  So the guy put the scarves on, not a chance of knowing him.  Yeah, he's way out of the mix.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:52:30]  I met his best friend at Dyson's wedding, Jerry...  Okay, I'm getting close to you there.  Yeah, Jerry's...  Because you got that Elvis connection, man.  A little bit.  The brother of the guy who put the scarves on Elvis?  I don't know what he did.  Jerry something.  I don't know what it is.  But he's saying he was best friends with Elvis.  Would Elvis say the same thing if he was alive?  Yeah, he's in all the fucking Elvis videos.  I know.  I keep dipping into the damn ice cream.  I'm actually staring at Penn's ice cream like it's tits.  Because I don't want to throw it away in front of him.  That's not the reason.  You're actually enjoying it, aren't you?  I already said I'm enjoying it, but I'm enjoying it so much I don't want to eat the whole damn thing. 
[01:53:00]  I just gave mine to fucking Sam.  It's so good.  I'd save it for later, but it's going to melt all over the place.  I would never have thought that's sea salt.  So you taste it and the chocolate is like, oh, there's a little salt in there.  It's good ice cream.  We get the dark chocolate with the sea salt at home.  We got to go into a lab.  It was like a food lab.  And I'm thinking they're putting us in the coats and shit.  I'm thinking, yeah, this is wanky. 
[01:53:30]  This is just your fucking TV.  And then you go in there, and there's actually a person whose life is making ice cream.  And they get all this stuff, and she goes, well, what do you like?  And I started telling her, I was doing like a turtle type thing, some sea salt, some chocolate.  And she said, can't use the word turtle.  It's trademark.  Because I thought I would have turtle ice cream.  It's called Swirtle.  I would get turtle ice cream, and then I would get Howard Kalin and Mark Vollman, who are  friends of mine, the turtles, to play at the final party.  Oh, wow.  Turtle ice cream. 
[01:54:00]  They said, oh, no, no.  Turtles with ice cream.  Other people own that.  That's copyright problems.  They do, huh?  So we went with Swirtle.  I like Swirtle.  It's kind of catchy.  It's very catchy.  It's got a swirl of chocolate in there.  Turtle.  Did you ever think you would see someone you knew on the carton of a dairy product, Jim,  that wasn't locked in your closet?  No, not at all.  Exactly.  I've got quite a few of the milk cartons autographed.  Magic Swirtle.  There it is.  Yeah. 
[01:54:30]  And a picture of me.  Yes.  You know?  A picture of me on an ice cream.  Stare at that while you spoon out the ice cream.  Yeah, exactly.  Treat for the talent in the eyes.  Let your mind go wild as you eat the ice cream.  So what happens?  You go through the process of trying it, and you take a bite, and then they call you back  in an hour, and they go, all right, we've done this.  No, no, they have this monster instant freeze machine, you know?  Wow.  And you kind of go, the vanilla's a little cloying.  And they go, okay, let's pull it back a little bit. 
[01:55:00]  And they go, and you go, and Dennis Rodman has this incredibly sophisticated ice cream palette.  So Dennis Rodman's sitting there going, um, a little bit more so.  Really?  And she goes, okay.  And you go, wow.  Because I was satisfied with the ice cream like three steps before Dennis was.  Right, right.  And so Dennis is just tasting, tasting, tasting, and then Dennis goes, perfect. 
[01:55:30]  I go, okay, Dennis, go get dressed for the party.  You just brought him along, or he was on your team?  He was on my team.  I was on the team.  So I had Dennis, LaToya, and Lisa Renna were my team, and we put it together.  How's LaToya?  Is she nuts?  You know, um, I know, that's why I'm asking you.  It's surprising.  Because we all think, people that have met her say that she's not nuts, but she certainly portrays that she's nuts.  It's remarkable, because we had, I didn't get to work with Dennis or with LaToya for the whole season. 
[01:56:00]  And then they threw them on my team at the end as kind of a change-up, you know, to see how we do.  And LaToya, I was kind of hesitant, because I had never worked with her, so I thought that she was nuts.  And I thought she was really straightforward and kind of smart.  I don't mean, you know, smart like Richard Feynman's smart.  Like, I don't think Stockholm is on the phone going, which Nobel do we give her?  It's kind of tough.  It's either chemistry or medicine. 
[01:56:30]  She's got both in the bag.  We can't give her both.  Which do we do?  I don't think Stockholm's having any trouble with that.  Not that, no.  No.  For show business, which, you know, is a whole, that's the Special Olympics of intellect.  Who's she above in smarts?  Well, you know.  Who's just below her in smarts?  Just below her in smarts?  I don't know.  Probably Stephen Baldwin.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  Very good answer, yeah.  That is a very good answer.  And, you know, I like them both, and LaToya's great.  And then LaToya, you know, Teller comes in for the final task, and the cameras are all rolling, 
[01:57:00]  and LaToya's having this conversation with Teller.  And Teller's looking at her and smiling, and she takes about five minutes to realize that  Teller doesn't talk.  And then we realize that LaToya Jackson has never heard of Teller.  Oh, no.  She is one of them.  That sucks.  Oh, man.  And so she learns that Teller doesn't talk, unlike Leon Russell.  You know, I was on Fallon with Leon Russell, who's a big hero of mine, you know, played 
[01:57:30]  with a wrecking crew on every single from, like, 61 to 64, the piano was Leon Russell.  Every single that comes out, you know, from Gary Lewis, you know, and the Playboys to all  that stuff is all Leon Russell.  And, of course, then the Joe Cocker, and then the stuff on his own.  And he's there in a wheelchair with a long beard and a long hair, and I walk up, and I  go, Mr. Russell, so nice to meet you.  He goes, I don't suppose your partner's going to talk to me.  Oh, there you go.  And I'm like, wow. 
[01:58:00]  Leon Russell knows.  Because I'm okay with that.  With people that, like, Leon Russell should never have heard of Penn and Teller.  He's got better things to do.  But LaToya Jackson, she's got five minutes.  Find out who Penn and Teller is.  But I had them on my team, and it was, you know, the surprising thing about Celebrity  Apprentice is, first of all, everybody else bitches about the hours, because you work  from, like, 5 a.m. to 10 p.m.  And that's, like, my usual work day, so I'm okay.  Yeah, yeah.  But everybody else is like, whoa, that's long and tedious. 
[01:58:30]  And it's also pretty fun, because you get to go into a lab and see how they make ice  cream, which I didn't know.  I know, like a lab, you just think, oh, you know, they bring in some milk and freeze it  and do that.  I think there's, like, a lab coat and people in a sterile environment doing testing.  And also, as you said, you think you leave for, like, two hours and come back.  You don't think they got magic cold machine.  They're like a James Bond villain.  You know, Batman, Mr. Freeze. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, you want ice cream instantly?  Bang!  You would think that quality wouldn't be as good out of that instant, freeze-y thing.  Well, have you ever had liquid nitrogen ice cream?  Uh, no.  Oh, then you have not lived, sir.  Really?  Find yourself a supplier, because it's illegal.  Because, you know, when I do, other people do illegal stuff.  It's like drugs and hoops.  When I do illegal stuff, it involves sub-zero gases.  Right.  But you can get yourself, through a welding company and a little bribe on the side, you 
[01:59:30]  can get yourself a container of liquid nitrogen.  You know, they used to do it in the school shows.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  They'd freeze the banana and smash it.  The rose and smash it.  And then you just take a metal mixing bowl, and you put in some cream, some sugar, you know,  some swirtle.  Put that into a bowl, just as soup.  And then you take a doer, as it's called in the chemistry biz.  See, Stockholm's got me on speed call.  And you pour it into there while you mix it.  Now, of course, if you spill too much on, you get frostbite, and you, you know, die. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah, true.  But, you know, that's why they try to keep it illegal.  Fucking pigs.  Just because it can really fuck you up making ice cream.  And then you stir it in, and really, in like six seconds, it makes a whole batch of ice cream.  And, of course, it's liquid nitrogen.  It goes right into the air.  It's gone.  There are no bubbles in it.  No, nothing.  It's just this really smooth, beautiful ice cream made really, really wicked fast.  Why isn't that supplied to the people, like in stores? 
[02:00:30]  Well, because making it with liquid nitrogen is really dangerous.  See, I'm suggesting when you do stuff that's dangerous, it's like heroin, which there's a really strong upside to.  Right.  You know.  That is true.  The upside, the downside is you lose your hand.  The upside is the ice cream is terrific.  Exactly.  Exactly.  And risk-reward, it's not up there with heroin.  It's just not in the same.  Risk-reward with heroin is you've got some sores all over your body, and you feel like you're 
[02:01:00]  coming 24 hours a day.  That's a good risk-reward, right?  A few sores on your body, I feel great.  But lose a hand, have a good thing of ice cream, you've got to be in that special pendulant category.  Well, this is pretty good, though.  I know.  This is really, really good.  No nitrogen used, but pretty goddamn good.  It's ridiculously good.  Yeah.  I know.  I keep digging in.  And you guys will be, I'm sure your listeners will run out and buy cases.  And also, you know, hide traces, you know, over behind the rocky road or something. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah, yeah.  You don't need that.  You don't need that at all.  Terrible flavor.  And then there's this wonderful chocolatey vanilla.  Where do they go again?  Walgreens?  Well, Walgreens, which is Dwayne Reed.  Okay.  It's a whole thing.  Yeah, yeah.  But you're national.  You're bad.  You're nationwide.  It's crazy.  It's Walgreens most of the places.  I love that song.  It's easy to talk.  But I'm not even kidding.  People are asking me on PalTalk here.  They're like, is it really good, Anthony?  Or are you just saying?  I'm like, no, this is fucking great.  Because you would lie on the air, but not on PalTalk. 
[02:02:00]  Not on PalTalk.  Exactly.  Right?  You're right.  You're going to type, yeah, I'm saying it's good, but boy, it really sucks.  That must be a new thing.  We sure pulled it over on all those people.  That's got to be a new listener, because they all know we'll tell if it's good.  It's good or not after he leaves.  Exactly.  You're going to let Penn go.  He's got a busy day.  He's a very busy man.  They're telling us, by the way.  For real.  Amazing ice cream.  I really, I love this stuff.  I'm going out and buying some.  Good. 
[02:02:30]  And bringing it home.  Please.  Cases.  And it only counts until Saturday.  There will still be ice cream after that, but I don't give a fuck about it after that.  I want for my charity, buy it right now, get the ice cream, and it's wicked good.  It really is great.  So it's one of the few times you can actually eat ice cream and be helping a charity.  This money does not go to a certain P. Gillette.  I mean, for all you want to be cynical about Celebrity Apprentice, I am looking, if I do  it right, $350,000 for a charity that really does great work. 
[02:03:00]  That's huge.  Of course, if I lose, it's $350,000 for a charity that also does great work.  But anyway.  But you want to be the guy.  I would like to be the guy.  So we're not even going to mention the other guy.  I think you're in.  But you're selling ice cream with the other guy right here in New York City.  Penn Jillette's Swizzle, right?  Swertle.  Swertle.  Swertle.  Swizzle.  Jesus.  Swertle.  Swertle.  Swertle.  Swertle.  It's the one with Penn's face.  But the problem is, Swertle's really small on the packaging.  All right. 
[02:03:30]  There he goes.  Go buy Penn's ice cream.  Look, he's not in the room.  It's so fucking good.  Yeah, of course he is.  I can't stop eating this shit.  Your sister came to our show.  Yes, she loves you.  Oh, in Vegas?  Yeah, Dawn came.  And, oh, she loved the show.  She just fucking can't say enough about it.  You know, really, really not hard to believe she's your sister.  Why?  They have to carry her out drunk.  I didn't have to ask for any ID whatsoever.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She said it.  It just, you know, there's a family resemblance. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  There's a style.  Dawn rules.  She was great.  She had such a great time.  She was thrilled to death to meet you.  And people were thrilled she was in the audience.  Because she came up and, you know, after the show and announced pretty clearly who she  was.  She's hilarious.  And people around were like, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah.  What a yelp on her.  That's great.  What a yelp on her.  She was posing for pictures of us together, but then also for other people.  Oh, that's hilarious. 
[02:04:30]  She's a pisser.  She had such a great time, though.  Yes.  She loves your show.  Yeah, we had a wonderful, we didn't know she was there.  You should have let us know.  Yeah.  We would have set you up and stuff.  But she just came like a regular punter.  Yeah, like a regular person.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We didn't give her fancy, fancy O&A nepotism seats.  We have the O&A nepotism section, but that was empty that night.  There she was.  Yeah.  It's a great show, man.  It's just, what a blast.  Well, thank you. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah, it's great.  You know, we're doing, I gotta tell you, Celebrity Apprentice sure moves tickets.  I mean, we're filled up all the time now.  It opens you up to people that probably normally wouldn't do it.  It's amazing, you know, and forgive me if this sounds unpleasant, but I thought that  there were a lot of people who didn't like Penn & Teller, but I didn't know there were  that many people who had never heard of Penn & Teller.  No idea.  People that come to the show and go, I never heard of you guys until Celebrity Apprentice. 
[02:05:30]  They've been around for how long?  That's unbelievable.  And you just, you know, and I say, well, yeah, and they love the show.  And now they're new fans, and now I say, well, in terms of economics, the people you  want coming to your show are people that have never heard of you before, because then you're  starting a whole new market.  But I just go, man, I thought you all made your decision on us.  A long time ago.  About 93.  Right, right.  About 93 you decided, they suck, or I like them, the battle lines were drawn, and you moved  on through your life, you know? 
[02:06:00]  Yeah, who are these?  I don't even know who they are people who do not know Penn & Teller, right?  No clue.  No clue.  And really, they would come, and after the show, they go, I didn't know you did a magic  show.  Oh, my God.  I saw you at Celebrity Apprentice.  I can't.  And we just did one of the Indian casinos somewhere, you know, Biloxi or something, you know?  Yeah.  And this guy comes up to me, I'm on my way to the steakhouse before the show, and he  says to me, watch out, Celebrity Apprentice, no idea what you do, but I'm coming to see  you tonight.  Wow. 
[02:06:30]  Wow.  And now that's a great deal of support.  Yeah.  That's really great.  I just kind of go, wow, no idea what I do.  Boy, that's kind of a kick in the ass.  Kind of like, shit.  Saturday Night Live, Letterman.  Right.  You know, bullshit, all those things just blew right by.  There's a certain segment of the population that doesn't know, you know?  And I was talking to Bob Dylan's manager, who said, you think you're surprised?  Oh, wow.  No.  All right. 
[02:07:00]  No fucking way.  And I said, no fucking way.  No fucking way.  Occasionally, I'm on the phone, and I'll say, I work with Bob Dylan, and they'll go, who?  No.  Come on.  And I went, okay, I'm fine with this then.  You're fine.  Yeah.  Wow.  And then he started listing things.  He said, Fargo.  Everybody you know saw Fargo, right?  Yeah.  I go, yeah.  He goes, not a very successful movie.  Goodfellas.  Everybody you know saw Goodfellas, right?  Yeah.  A lot of people haven't heard of it.  He said, just, you know, Elvis used to go crazy.  Who?  That there were... 
[02:07:30]  Perfectly timed.  That there were Aboriginal people in New Guinea that had not heard of him, you know?  And I got over that long ago.  I realized that out of the seven billion people on the planet, seven billion haven't heard  of Pentateuch.  You know, if you round it off, seven billion...  I kind of thought this small little chunk of the world, this, you know, 350 to 400 million,  this tiny little drop of humanity, who uses most resources, tiny little drop of humanity, 
[02:08:00]  had kind of...  And I'm not saying beloved.  Right.  I'm not saying no well.  Aware, though.  I'm just saying...  Aware.  Just saying, oh, Pentateuch, nah.  You know, that's all I'm requiring out of you.  Pentateuch, nah.  You know, that's...  Just, yeah.  Know that I exist.  But just those two words, together with an ampersand between them, mean nothing.  Nothing.  You know, hegemony.  It's the same exact thing. 
[02:08:30]  I don't know what that word means.  Don't know what Pentateuch means.  Boom.  No idea.  I wanted to ask you something about bullshit, because I was watching it recently.  I fucking love the show.  Was it harder, as time went on, to get people that weren't on to the fact that you might  fucking say some nasty shit about them?  Well, first of all, let me tell you, you know, I have a real problem with Michael Moore,  and even with Borat.  You know, I have a little problem with misrepresenting. 
[02:09:00]  Right.  We would go to the people and say, we do a show called bullshit.  Here is a DVD.  Penn and Teller disagree with you.  Do you want to go on the show?  You know, that's what we would say.  Next thing you say, I'm Dr. Maury Smith, and I think...  And we had all sorts of video of people, like, picking their nose and all this stuff.  We would never use it.  We tried to attack ideas.  As a matter of fact, as the years went on, I kept saying, well, you know, we can be mean 
[02:09:30]  to the guys on our side.  Yeah.  So we actually would have more trouble getting people to agree with us, because they'd go,  I've been noticing this show...  Yeah, I see a trend.  Yeah.  You just...  You attack our ties and how we look and our hair.  Yeah.  Like, well, that's because we agree with you.  We don't want to make it too easy for you.  You know, so like the guys from Reason Magazine, like Nick Gillespie and those, like the Libertarian  guys, who we would call up, like, every three shows and have the same people on, people  from the Cato Institute and stuff.  We'd have them on.  They'd go, well, last time you had me on, you're like, really fucked with me? 
[02:10:00]  Yeah, we agreed with everything you said.  They said, yeah, but what was wrong with my suit checker?  Or hair or something.  Constantly bad.  But, you know, we would have...  And there's a sad side of this, too, which is that everybody that we would have on and  bash and tear to pieces, rip a new asshole, they would do better after they were on  the show.  Oh, man.  Yeah, well.  So they all knew that, you know, and they all knew they would go through that.  And they also knew that we would attack their ideas, but not there. 
[02:10:30]  You know, we did one thing on this show, which I thought was really funny.  I did this thing where I said, you know, people think we take people out of context.  They think that we pull out the stupidest thing they say.  We would like to show you a minute and a half of what we get is raw material, not context.  And we had one of the...  I think it was on the Bible show.  The creationism show.  We had a guy do his full hunk without editing.  And it was really funny.  Wow.  Because we would do our editing to make them look better. 
[02:11:00]  Because, you know, if you're doing drama, your hero is only as strong as your villain.  Right.  Yes.  So if you have people that are too...  You know, James Bond wants to have a really, really good villain.  Yeah.  You don't want James Bond going up against a 16-year-old shoplifter.  You know, boom, ba-da-dum, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  So...  It's easy to discredit somebody if their argument sucks or they're stupid or they come off looking  ridiculous.  Yeah.  So we would spend all this time making the enemies look really, really good and concise 
[02:11:30]  so that I could come in and they'd go, man, Ben just took that fucker apart.  Yes.  Whereas in reality, if you saw the full hour and a half, you know, a six-year-old could  have taken them apart.  You know, so we'd be buoying, buoying people up.  Yeah.  But they always knew.  And the amazing thing I'll tell you, we did, you know, eight years of bullshit.  Eight years of something like almost 90 shows, I think.  And not one lawsuit that stuck at all. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Two person threatened, two people threatened, but never took legal action.  That's as close as they came.  So we were really careful and you would love, and I told you this last time, but it's worth  repeating, you know, the lawyers, we worked with the same lawyers for eight years and they  would get really good at giving notes, the notes of the script.  And we really should have these up on the web or something because in this very, very  legal hand of a $600 an hour lawyer, they would say, not sure about this wording, could 
[02:12:30]  you call him cocksucker instead?  Not sure if this is actionable, maybe pull out cunt pickle.  You know, pull out that, would that be better?  And then circled.  And then you also see stuff you never thought you'd see, you never saw in your high school  paper, which is cunt pickle, circled, next to it, good.  We're really safe.  Because, you know, after eight years, you really run out of obscenity. 
[02:13:00]  Oh, true, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, you really, you say, we've used motherfucker eight times in this show.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, we need, we need something else.  And when they told us, I was really proud of this.  They told us for the chiropractor show, that absolutely nowhere in the show, any place,  could I even hint at the word quack.  Quack.  They said, you say the word quack, I'm telling you, you'll lose your house.  It's that simple. 
[02:13:30]  They're all listening.  Their lawyers are all on.  Keep that away.  And by the way, for those listening now, I'm not saying chiropractors are quack.  I'm just saying we couldn't say those two things.  So I'm going, you know, I just feel like such a pussy, not being able to use the word  the whole show.  So I said, for the shoot, I wrote in the script, you know, for the call sheet, I wrote, we want  100 ducks.  Yes.  100 ducks.  And we just dump ducks all over the set. 
[02:14:00]  And I was just going, sue them.  Just sue them all you want.  So I'd be going, you know, we're talking about chiropractor.  Quack, quack, quack.  Yeah, that was brilliant.  And I never said it.  And the ducks are all over.  And we never even explained.  We never said, like, they're speaking for us.  Oh, you didn't have to.  Never underlined nothing.  It's just all.  And we did the multi-level marketing.  I love that one.  The word you can't use is pyramid. 
[02:14:30]  Pyramid, right.  So we had a, you know, a blue screen of Gaza behind us with the pyramids, and we were  in Egyptian outfits.  Had no mention of pyramid scheme.  You couldn't say that word?  No.  Oh, no.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  I couldn't say pyramid.  Wait, are you worried, too?  But you say, like, they're all watching.  Like, if you say so-and-so's a quack or this profession's a quack, that people watching in  that profession can sue because you're hurting them?  Or just people?  Well, it's very, very difficult if we say chiropractic in general. 
[02:15:00]  Da-da-da-da-da.  But our problem was we had a particular person on screen.  Right, right, okay.  And then if the show included that, that could be stopping them from making a living.  Right.  Definition of character.  There's all sorts of things that are there.  And also all sorts of things that I hate it when this is true, but a lot of times the  law is correct, you know, and you shouldn't be able to rip an individual apart without me  doing due diligence, and what exactly would be due diligence for me to call someone a  quack.  I mean, how much research do I have to do before, in good conscience, I'm not even talking 
[02:15:30]  legally, but morally, how much do you have to know before you discredit someone's entire  medical practice?  Yeah, yeah.  Now, in general, it's really easy to do, and in theory, it's really easy to do, but  an individual, you want to be very, very careful.  And they could easily call people that would say, this person helped me and changed my life.  Sure, sure.  So that there goes your argument.  Sure, yeah.  That poor bastard that was selling the drinks on that multi-level...  Oh, that was heartbreaking.  Oh, I felt so bad for that.  I mean, that was one of the shows where we didn't really have villains. 
[02:16:00]  No, no.  We were so much on their side.  It was just a fucking cast of victims, that show.  Can you explain?  I didn't see that one.  Well, there's multi-level marketing are like when they have a product that you sell to your  friends.  Right, right, of course.  And there's always X amount of money to get in.  So you pay $5,000 and you get a case of this stuff that you're going to sell to your friends.  And it's never about selling this stuff.  It's about selling the business to another person.  Of course.  So the stuff, you can't possibly make money on this stuff. 
[02:16:30]  I sell the whole business.  Yeah, I want to know about the guy that you felt sorry for.  So, you know, we did this when there was a real downturn in the economy and a lot of  people who'd lost their jobs were investing $5,000, $10,000, $15,000 of their savings to  get into this business and then trying to get their other friends into it and then finding  out that they didn't want to rip off their friends and had a cellar full of shit they  couldn't sell and had also taken, I mean, if you lose your job, even if you don't lose 
[02:17:00]  your job, $5,000 is a serious chunk of change.  You know, it's not like, we're not looking at people losing like a hundred bucks, you  know, which still is a serious amount of change.  That's a lot of groceries.  I don't mean to dismiss that.  But I'm talking about five grand changes what you do for the next two months.  It really does change what you do.  No matter who you are, that changes it.  And we were getting people to put this money in and these were people who had been ripped  off and sucked in and, you know, were on camera going, you know, I'm not going to sell 
[02:17:30]  this business to my friends because I would just be ripping off my friends.  Yeah.  Because they realized like, it just doesn't.  So I guess I'm just kind of eating this.  When he went to, when that one guy.  How bad was the product though?  It doesn't matter.  I mean.  It's a widget.  It doesn't matter.  The products are all okay.  Just okay.  You know, but I mean, they're not, it doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter how good they are.  The fact is you can't make money unless you sell the whole business.  Yeah.  And it's simple.  It's one of those simple things you see.  It's shaped like a triangle.  Yeah, exactly. 
[02:18:00]  Like a three-dimensional triangle.  Legally, why wouldn't somebody classify as pyramid?  Is the pyramid thing kind of like a, is that a copywritten thing?  No, pyramid is a legal term.  Oh.  A Ponzi scheme or pyramid.  Like a Ponzi scheme would be, let's say, social security.  There you go.  Which is, if you get it early, you make a lot of money.  I'm just telling you right now, if you're under 25, social security, you're getting fucked.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:18:30]  Just in case no one else has told you that, at least you can hear it on O&A.  All the money you put into social security, you are not getting it back.  It's as simple as that.  Look at classic pyramid schemes.  The base can never support what's on top of it.  No, they can't.  The big trick of a pyramid scheme is be the first guy.  Be that fucking pointy stone.  If you haven't thought of the pyramid scheme yourself, you don't want to be a fault in it.  Exactly.  If you've thought of it yourself, you've got a good chance of getting your money back. 
[02:19:00]  I went to one of those.  I remember the company name and everything.  When I was newly sober, a guy in the program took me, and it was probably like 1988 or something  like that, and he took me to one of these companies, and I was like, oh God, this isn't  good, and then something inside me went, eh, this is shit.  Well, I got taken to an Amway.  It was Amway meeting.  Yeah.  And no one, it's very, it's very vague.  No one wants to tell you what it is.  It's like, just come.  It's a great opportunity.  And you're like, what?  What is it?  No, it's got to be presented.  The whole thing's got to be presented.  They never tell you first.  You can't tell.  So I sit there, and there's a woman, and she's got a chalkboard, and she's writing, and she's 
[02:19:30]  making a big triangle.  And she's going, and going, and going, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I'm sitting there going like, what the fuck is this?  And she goes, well, this was known as, and she writes, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, on  the blackboard, she's like, the American way.  It's like, this is the American way, selling things.  She goes, we shortened it to Amway.  And I'm like, fuck, they got me.  Fuck.  That's brilliant.  God damn it.  And I'm sitting there like, oh, God. 
[02:20:00]  See, I'm thinking the big mistake is getting people who are newly sober.  Don't you want people shit-faced drunk?  What a great idea.  What a great idea.  When you knew you were eager to change your life and do great.  Yeah, I'll just sell this stuff.  It'll be great.  Were you actually selling this stuff, Am, for a while?  No, no.  I was fucking, like, pissed that I had to stay the rest of the meeting.  Yeah, you realized.  The second she's at Amway, because I had heard about Amway.  I never knew how it was presented.  If I did, I would have known this was playing Amway.  So when they got me, and I'm like, what is she getting at? 
[02:20:30]  Fucking get to the point.  Oh, fuck, it's Amway.  How long was it?  How long was the meeting?  It seemed like it's still going on.  It was.  It's like the time.  You ever gone to one of the timeshare thing?  Where they say.  Free this and free that.  You just got to go to the timeshare.  Get a free hibachi.  Yeah, yeah.  Just through the whole thing.  Meanwhile, why don't you calculate what your time as a human is worth per hour and how much  that hibachi ends up costing you.  I'm worth more than a hibachi.  In your time, right?  Lady.  The hibachi is also, because I went, because I wanted to learn about it.  Yeah.  So I went to the full timeshare. 
[02:21:00]  In Vegas, you know, timeshare capital.  They put people off the strip to get a hibachi.  And it was, I think, four and a half hours to get a hibachi that I thought was probably  worth about $3.  Right.  How does it work, the timeshare?  The timeshare is you buy a property that you can use two weeks a year.  Oh, two weeks.  Okay.  So, you know, or three weeks or whatever you buy.  We had one in our family.  Yeah.  You chip in with a bunch of people and they get a book.  Well, there's a company that sells them and they break them up.  Basically, you got to go on vacation to the same shitty fucking condo every year. 
[02:21:30]  That's what it comes down to.  And you have to, how far in advance do you work out what weeks are yours?  You know, all that depends.  It looks great at first, but then year after year, you're going back to the same place.  And then they'll also tell you that you can trade that for another place.  You know, you buy your timeshare in Terre Haute and you can get the one in, you know, Aspen.  Yeah, sure.  Sure you can.  It turns out that deal's a little hard to make.  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah, because why would the Aspen guy go to your shitty place? 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  You're right.  But they do them everywhere.  And every family, you know, every family has somebody in them that did that.  And all you've got to do is you've got to do the arithmetic, but you've got to do it on your own.  Right.  You can't do the arithmetic with the guy they're helping you.  No.  Which is always good advice on any business deal.  Do your arithmetic in private.  Don't have the guy who's making the deal with you go, yeah, don't get it.  You don't have to carry the three.  Oh, I guess I don't have to carry the three. 
[02:22:30]  All right.  Just add it right now.  Whatever you say.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It gets worse.  Let's get some asshole sniffing going.  Let's pep this place up into a mood of fun and festivity.  More of Opie and Anthony's Worst of 2013.  Coming up.  Opie and Anthony's Worst of 2013 continues right now.  Right now.  Right now.  Worst of 2013.  Opie and Anthony show.  My name is E-Rock.  And we're up to part two of the Penn Jillette-Trace Adkins saga. 
[02:23:00]  You just heard part one.  And towards the end, he told us about Trace Adkins being a good friend of Penn's and has some amazing stories.  And if we ever get the opportunity to talk to him, we should.  And we find some stories showing what a tragic life this man has lived.  So here we are checking out what's the deal with Trace Adkins.  Opie and Anthony's Worst of 2013.  I've got to help out Penn Jillette because I'm learning the country guy, you know, is the favorite here, right?  Country artists have the whole country.  I forgot about that.  Trace Adkins is a formidable opponent. 
[02:23:30]  Because.  Number one.  But he has a shitty ice cream.  No one likes maple in their ice cream.  Hi, hi, this is Trace Adkins.  He's got a great voice, man.  That guy's fucking voice is so deep.  And his talking voice.  He does like a PSA or commercial or some shit.  And he's just, hi, this is Trace.  You can't even imitate it.  It's like all bottom end.  Do we know any of his songs?  Yeah.  He's big and country.  I'm Trace Adkins.  You know a Trace Adkins song?  For real?  Yeah. 
[02:24:00]  I don't think I do.  Dancing by the Meadow.  No, it isn't.  Ah.  Oh, yeah.  This is new country, bitches.  Ladies love country, boys.  This is for all you sophisticated ladies out there.  Woo-hoo!  Do women want to fuck them?  Oh, what was that?  Jimmy?  I'm sorry.  Ice cream.  Oh, my God.  Ice cream.  Ice cream.  Ice cream.  Ice cream.  Ice cream, farts in the studio.  What's in that deep, that is?  Daddy wore a tie.  Mama never fried a chicken.  Ballet, straight A's most likely to. 
[02:24:30]  Where is that?  Atlanta?  Oh, Pendulet's fucked.  4.5 million hits on this.  4.5 million hits on that fucking video.  Yeah.  He gets pussy if he wants it?  He's done.  Yeah.  Poor Pend.  Plus, the country guys get money.  I don't know how they do it.  What do you mean?  But on the show, like, you know, they do fundraising things.  Yeah.  And you just call your rich, the celebrities call whatever rich celebrities they know to  bring money.  Yeah.  And, like, the country guys, especially, like, Trace, they get six figures from people. 
[02:25:00]  Wow.  Jesus.  Pend's so fucked.  Could you find a Trace Adkins PSA?  His ice cream's way better to know.  Trace Adkins PSA.  See if you can find.  Yeah.  Play one of these.  Listen to his speaking voice.  It's insane.  Food allergies result in more than 300,000 ambulatory care visits each year among children.  Year.  Hi, I'm Trace Adkins, and my daughter, Brianna, is one of the 3 million children in the U.S.  living with potentially life-threatening food allergies.  To learn more about food allergies, please speak with your doctor or visit foodallergy.org. 
[02:25:30]  More than 12 million Americans have food allergies.  He could, like, have a broadcasting career if he didn't have a semi-successful country career.  Oh, that's right.  A public service from Phan.  The food allergy and anaphylaxis.  The Phan.  Public service from The Phan.  Plus, he's playing for the American Red Crow.  Of course.  Oh, Pend's so fucked.  And his ice cream is way better.  I forgot the middle America country.  Like, country is the number one music.  No, it's not a vote.  No?  What?  It's not a vote. 
[02:26:00]  People can't...  Donald Trump picks.  They gotta get out and buy it.  But if they sell a lot of fucking ice cream...  Right.  I'm gonna buy Trace Atkins ice cream.  I don't even know who that Jew is, that Pend...  Yeah.  It's not a Jew.  He's a big Jew who don't like God.  I like Trace, and I like God.  I like an artist that loves the Lord, not the tribe that done killed him.  Yeah.  What?  He makes a lot of things disappear.  I don't trust him.  That Pendulette.  Jew-let.  Isn't that Pendulette?  He looks like a Jew. 
[02:26:30]  I just assumed.  They both got ponytails.  You might as well go with Trace.  I'm just glad I ain't got a pick-a-nigger.  Oh, my God.  What?  Wow.  Well, that's how they talk.  I mean, and Lil Jon was in the final four, so...  He was?  Yeah.  Thank God they got him out there.  You got some trickery.  You wanted to say that word today, and you figured out how to say it.  Please.  It was the 20th time I said it already.  This hour.  You're 21, right, Ant?  20th. 
[02:27:00]  Oh, shit.  Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo.  Fuck yeah, the cops!  Chip and other than that.  Chip and other than that.  I fucking fight with the cops.  Fuck yeah, I threw all their guns away.  I'm like, go pick them up, Flatfoot.  Flatfoot.  Flatfoot.  What's Trace's ice cream?  Maple and what else?  Macadamia nut.  Macadamia and maple.  Ah, my God.  Who wants that shit?  You don't want macadamia and maple?  What's the basic flavor?  So vanilla is the base 
[02:27:30]  And then it's maple  But it's got his picture on it  What does his ice cream carton look like  Let's see Trace's picture  Because Trace is one of those country guys  He looks like a real man  I bet it's the same as Penn's  Oh my god  With the cowboy hat though  He's like  I'm Trace  And who's a little more sexy  Let's be honest  Trace has his shirt unbuttoned a little bit up top  Penn looks like a fucking  Penn looks like someone that worked on the fucking Manhattan Project 
[02:28:00]  Right  Yeah  Oh, our pal's fucked  Penn Jillette looks like he could be Jewish  He does  Trace looks like a good time party fucking country boy  Why didn't Penn Jew it down a little bit?  Fuck  Can't she have him standing in front of a bank with his fists raised?  Oh my god  You had to go less Jew-y  I know  For middle America  Look, they actually made the lid of the ice cream a yarmulke  Just pull it off  Yes 
[02:28:30]  That's pay us coming down the side  You're not supposed to write  Buy this and God dies a slow death  That's not going to sell  There's a dude with a goatee and a cowboy hat  And the American Red Cross logo next to him  It couldn't be more American  Why not support the troops?  Right  I know  Penn's got a yarmulke with an Al-Qaeda thing  Support Penn's ice cream  That's the point we're making  You just see American flag when you look at Trace's ice cream  That's it  I don't care what flavor  I thought Penn had this  I thought Penn had it in the bag too  And then I realized 
[02:29:00]  Ah, you know  You know what the best part about Celebrity Apprentice this whole season was?  Huh?  Watching everybody go into the boardroom  And Donald Trump loves Gary Busey  Yeah  So he would never fire him  And he would always say who's the weakest player on the team  Oh no  And the people would always be like  Gary  It was Gary  But they knew every time  Donald would be like  Yeah, but Gary's kind of a genius  So let's go beyond that  Kind of a genius  They would let him  Every time  He would let him skate every time  He likes Gary  He loves Gary  Gary made it to like the top five 
[02:29:30]  I didn't get to  Sounds like  I didn't watch this  Sounds like the welfare system  Fuck  How is that?  You know  Wow  People that you know aren't that good  And doing things  Right  And then they just keep getting supported and pushed along  You're saying Donald Trump supports welfare?  They're not contributing  Hey, why don't we get Trump out?  Gary Busey is a burden to that show  And he should be removed and sent back to where he came from  No, because it's all ratings and he's good for the ratings  Can we get Donald Trump on the phone?  Busey, right?  Oh yeah  Can we get Donald Trump on the phone?  We can work on that, I think 
[02:30:00]  We gotta help our pal out, Penn Jillette  How are we gonna do that, though?  We'll talk to Donald himself  We're gonna make sure we understand that, you know, Trace is an all-American guy  But Penn deserves this  One for the Jews  We need to  Now, what happens?  What happens?  Let's say Trace sells more ice cream  He's going to  But, okay  Does it now instantly that Donald Trump is gonna pick him?  There are multiple tasks to this task  So you have to sell the most ice cream  But you also have to make the most money 
[02:30:30]  So if Trace Atkin goes, hey, Garth Brooks  Will you buy this one thing of ice cream for $2 million?  No way  They could do that?  100%  That sounds cheating  100% they can do it  But that sounds like cheating  They do it every season  It's all for charity, so they don't care  And they go, hey, I'm  Like, there are people on the show that are saying, you can't fire me  I'm the biggest fundraiser  And so, like, if you have famous friends  So then Penn can make his money disappear  Trace's money disappear  Right  Like he's a magician  Who's that?  I got more info on Trace Atkins 
[02:31:00]  This guy does not lose  What?  Oh, no  Yeah  Wait, what?  Take this phone call  I did not know  We gotta look this up  Make sure it's true  But Clint in Alabama  Clint  Hey guys, I don't know if he got caught cheating on her  She was just crazy  But in 1994  His ex-wife shot him  Through the heart and the lungs  And he lived  He don't lose  Trace's  Oh, yes  How is he gonna lose?  In 1994  His second wife shot him during an argument 
[02:31:30]  He never pressed charges  Because he believed that she never meant to pull the trigger  He's just a nice guy  Oh, my God  Oh, my God  Atkins stated that their divorce was closure enough for him  And the bullet went through his heart and his lungs  How does that happen?  He said he  The only reason he lived through the incident  Was because he lived so close to a hospital  Oh, my God  He's just a nice guy  Yeah  This is not good  My interaction with him was very positive  Oh, God  You met Trace Atkins  I walked by a window  And he, like, waved 
[02:32:00]  Because he, uh  I guess had seen my act  And we took a picture together  And he was very nice  Where's the picture?  I have it  I got it signed  I don't believe you  I don't play games  I don't believe you  Yeah?  Yeah  Mm-hmm  E-Rock's saying we've got to read Blue Heeler's tweet  I don't know where Blue Heeler's tweet is right now  Exactly  What does it say?  Why don't you just say it?  Who's Heeler?  It says Trace Atkins  Has a PSA on food allergies  Yet he's promoting a product with dairy and tree nuts 
[02:32:30]  Yeah, but  He can't do no wrong  That's our point  Yeah  That's our point  He can't do no wrong  Poor man  The iron is so thick  You can cut it with a knife  Plus Trace was in Lincoln  As Lincoln's lawyer  He also has a character  On King of the Hill  Was he in Lincoln?  Oh God  Oh man  And then we learn  A lot of people don't even know  Who Penn and Teller are  After all these years  The thing he was talking about  With Latoya  It was so funny  It was on the episode  Oh yeah  She was like a little put off 
[02:33:00]  That Teller wouldn't  Wouldn't talk to her  And then  Mary Lou Henner  Or somebody  Had to be like  No he doesn't  He doesn't talk  He's been doing this  For 30 years  Yeah, that's like  His gimmick  You dummy  How does she not know  Who Penn and Teller is?  She's in the entertainment business  That Jackson family  They're insulated, man  I understand regular  Fucking  You know  Joe's  Yeah  Why not know  Who Penn and Teller are?  But if you're in the business  How do you not know? 
[02:33:30]  Yeah  Let's say hi  To Luke  In Austin, Texas  Luke  Gentlemen  How y'all doing this morning?

[02:35:30]  You love maple  Fucking  They were showing Penn  Editing his commercial  And they came across  They didn't know what to do  Because they only had one close-up  Of the ice cream  And right behind it  You could see two showgirls  Bedazzled crotches  Oh, no  Next to the ice cream  Oh, and he's going to be like  Hi, I'm Trace Atkins  Right  I don't have any vaginas  In my commercial  This is about the Red Cross  Helping Americans  Show a small boy  That survived a fire 
[02:36:00]  Yes  Being soothed  With ice cream salve  And then there's Penn  If you like vagina  You'll like my ice cream  Oh, God, Penn  Yeah  No bullshit  Yeah  It's over  Yeah  Maybe we can get Donald Trump  On the show  Convince him  Yeah, maybe we can swear  The Donald  Maybe I'll make a hair joke  Yeah  It was a great joke  What about the birthers?  Trace is the underdog  Because he came  Last time he was on 
[02:36:30]  Celebrity Apprentice  He made it to the finals  Uh-huh  Piers Morgan beat him  Then again, fucking  Piers  Penn Jillette is very light  And he has well over a million  On Twitter  Trace Adkins only has 208,000  Now, I'm not saying  Twitter's everything  But he can reach a lot of people  Wait, Trace Adkins only has  A couple hundred thousand  On Twitter  Yeah, I have more than  Oh, really?

No  I think we made our point here today  Trace Adkins sings songs about the Arlington Cemetery  Right  And Penn Jillette does the bullet trick  Yeah  Yeah, but the bullet trick is very impressive  It's impressive  It is impressive  It's not exactly a tearjerker  Trace Adkins never fucking took a picture of my sister  He had his nose ripped off  True  Is it true?  Penn was in a Run DMC video?  That's not bad 
[03:00:00]  Yeah, the bill and not goes like that  The interaction with the blacks  Oh, yeah  Yeah  Fucking Chip  What a downer Chip is  Penn's creepy  I didn't know this about Penn  Rick in El Paso  Hey, Rick  Yeah  Hey  Yeah, Penn actually owns a piece of flesh

It's Frank  He's got a piece of flesh that has a tattoo on it  From a murderer after his execution  It was basically filleted off him  And put in a frame  Why did he want that?  Well, he's fucking Penn Gillette  Come on  He's a fucking guy for a freaky dude  But was it a famous murderer?  I'm not sure  During the interview 
[03:01:00]  He wasn't even sure he was supposed to have it  But he, you know  He said  Look  Yeah, it doesn't sound like something  You should be allowed to have  Right, right  We could add it to the list though  That's for sure  Wow, that's not good for him  Yes  I even know the case of the killer, actually  It was a murderer  You fart over here  No  But it was a very famous serial killer  Yeah  Who was it?  His name was the Jocularity Killer  He would laugh  Ha, ha, ha, ha  As he killed his victims  All right, we're done 
[03:01:30]  Trace Adkins  Not done with the show  Done with this, I guess  Yeah  Good luck to you  I hope people vote for Penn Gillette  But  There's no voting  Oh, yeah  That's true  He should buy his fucking ice cream  He needs all the help he can get  He's got a sex dungeon  True  Yeah, me too  Oh, yeah  Yeah, it gets worse  More of Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013  Worst of 2013  Coming up  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013 
[03:02:00]  Continues right now  Yeah, now, now  Worst of 2013  Opie and Anthony show  My name is E-Rock  And we're up to part three  Of the Trace Adkins Penn Jillette saga  That's going on here  Now we have Trace Adkins  Finally in studio  We found some incredible stories about him  So we needed to talk to him  Also joining us is Colin Quinn  And Tom Papa  And Trace comes in  Talks Celebrity Apprentice  Talks about his life  Talks about his ice cream  Of course 
[03:02:30]  And then some reason  Guy Fieri shows up  I don't remember what it was  Anyway, here it is  Trace Adkins  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013  On the Opie and Anthony channel  Trace Adkins  Here comes  Magnolia Bakery treats  Those are delightful  Yes  That's not Trace Adkins  No  Is that the wife that shot him?  That looks like a panda  Should we not bring that up?  Oh, god damn  Yeah, right  Hi, I'm Trace Adkins  There he is  Trace  Trace Adkins  Take a seat over here  Pull up a mic  We're on the air live 
[03:03:00]  We just do this  There's the voice  They told me y'all were  Oh, yeah  God damn, Trace Adkins  Let me tell you something  We're really good  I know  Do you know Colin Quinn?  Stop holding my hand, Quinn  How you doing?  Good to see you  Back in the day  You guys know each other?  No  No, but I'm a fan  I'm a fan of Colin Quinn  And Tom Papa to your right  Hey, Trace  He's good friends  With Jerry Seinfeld  That's his claim  No, I mean  He's acting with Michael Douglas 
[03:03:30]  In a new movie  The Liberace movie  The Liberace movie  Oh, yeah, really?  I'll brag for my pal Tom Papa  Thank you  You honestly think Trace  Or any of his buddies down there  Are going to go see that Liberace movie?  Hell no  Hells no  I'm probably not  Trace, we had a pendulet  In here yesterday  Oh, yeah?  And he was pitching his ice cream  You know, Apprentice  A celebrity all-star  Friggin' amazing Apprentice this season  Yeah  You guys are head-to-head now 
[03:04:00]  Yeah  So, now the object is to sell this ice cream  Yes  At this point  Right  How do you feel you're doing?  I'm doing great  I got a little pint of Penn's ice cream yesterday  I found a booger right on the top  Oh, shit  There's a booger right on the top  Oh, shit  There's a booger on the top of it  So, his ice cream has boogers in it  I'm just telling you  That could be detrimental  To ice cream sales  At least I tried to disguise mine with macadamia nuts  So, if something falls in there during production 
[03:04:30]  People think it's a macadamia  Right  I got you a good strategy  But his just has boogers  We got to explain to Trace  We're really good friends with Penn Jillette  He does the show a lot  But then we kind of started looking into your history  And we're all in  We're hoping you win this thing  Penn is sunk  Because your backstory is way better than Penn Jillette's  Absolutely  As far as country artists go  You fit that bill that everyone has stereotyped over the years  Of taking tragedy and turning it around  Pulling yourself up by the proverbial bootstraps, as they say 
[03:05:00]  Well, I suppose so  That's why I think I've written one positive love song in my life  And I was commissioned to write that one  And I think that's about it  Now, you came up as a working guy  You know, you worked in real  I worked in oil field for ten years  Oil field  I worked offshore on a drilling rig for six years  Roughneck, worked derrick  Jesus  Wow  That's a real job  That's how I cut my finger off 
[03:05:30]  Yeah, yeah  Apparently we read you cut your finger off  Yeah, I cut that one off  It was then  Right off  It's permanently at 90 degree angle  They put it back on  But it's bent like that  The doctor asked me  He said  It's not going to work anymore  I think I can save it  But how do you want  Do you want it straight?  And I said  No  I said  Put it in a sus position  So now you can play  I said  At least I can suspend a D or a G  You know  I said  Put it in a sus position  He went  Excuse me  I showed him with my other hand  I said  Dude, like that 
[03:06:00]  That's having some forethought  Wow  Well, dude  No, not really  Because I mean  The second that I cut it  That was the first thing I thought  Well, there goes my guitar playing  You know, I was pretty much over at that point  Wow  There's no way he's seeing Liberace  No, no  No, it's not  No  But wait, you worked in those oil rigs  Like off the coast and stuff?  Yeah  Wow  That's where the offshore ones are  Yeah, I worked in the go  Jesus Christ  Yeah  Oh no, I hung out to dry there  I'm sorry, Colin  I didn't mean to  Damn, I told Colin I'd be nice to him  When another guest was in 
[03:06:30]  And by the way  As Bobby Kelly pointed out to me  It was always funny to me  When it was Boss  Or Bobby Kelly  Then it was me  Then I was like  Oh, this is not funny at all  That's true  Man, that thing you and Seinfeld did a while back  Was brilliant  Oh, thanks  Damn  That was absolutely brilliant  The one-man show?  That was brilliant  He's got a new one  That we saw last night  That was great  Great  I'll bust it out  I want to  That's great  I'm all over it  I'm in  He does do a great thing  What are your  Barrow Street Theater  What are your  I could probably guess 
[03:07:00]  But your political affiliations  As far as things that are going on  On the news these days  What I say is the dismantling  Of the Constitution  Do you get involved in much of that?  Well, I don't get involved in it  You know, I don't  And people know that too  They come to my shows  And they're not going to get beat over the head  With any kind of  That's good  I don't do that  And I never have  And you know what  And I don't like people that do  But at least, you know  Some of the ones that do it  They're right up front with it  And you know that going in  That you're going to get that  I don't like to be ambushed  By somebody  Right, right, right  But anyway 
[03:07:30]  I'm a pretty conservative guy  Sure  You know  And what's going on right now  You know, I believe that  When the government starts using agencies  To persecute people  That they have political  And philosophical differences with  That's tyranny, my friend  Thank you  Absolutely  God damn  I got to agree  And with that fucking voice  Singing it like that  Yep  Yeah  That means business  It makes you believe  I agree  Okay  God, it's so nice  It's so refreshing  To see somebody  In the business  That we call show  Right  Well, I'm sure you heard 
[03:08:00]  Something similar to that  From Penn yesterday  Well, yeah  Yeah, a little bit  Penn again also  Doesn't really put himself  Out there  Politically that much  Yeah, he is a libertarian  And an atheist  He's sort of a libertarian  Yeah, yeah  He's a quasi-libertarian  And a libertarian  Is just a Republican  Who smokes dope  That's really true  Do you go shooting and stuff?  Yeah, I've heard  Something needs shooting  No, very good 
[03:08:30]  Yeah  I mean, I enjoy  A little gunfire  But I go to the range  There's not much  Not much going on  Well, I do appreciate  My Second Amendment right  I've got a lot of guns  I've got a lot of guns  Yeah, yeah  You don't have as many guns  As he does  I got a lot  It's very difficult  In New York too  You've got Predator drones  Well, I don't have a Predator drone  I want one of those  He's got one  I want a drone, man  Well, I got a pretty big one  With cameras on it  And stuff  I can send it up  Autonomously  To patrol the neighborhood  Awesome, awesome 
[03:09:00]  That's great  I monitored some people  Getting a pizza delivery  The other day  It was very exciting  Very compelling video  I got from that one  But no, I really do  And in New York  It's very difficult  As you probably know  To even say that you  You own guns  But no, I love it  I picked up a Barrett  50 cal  Man, they make those  Just right down the road  From where I live  In Murfreesboro, Tennessee  Oh, isn't that fantastic  You ever fire one of those?  I have  I don't have one yet  I'm about to get one  I just got a Desert Eagle  50 caliber 
[03:09:30]  I got one of those  Oh, wow  What a treat  You take that down  To the indoor range  And fire it  They won't  At my indoor range  They won't let me shoot it  They won't?  No  Over here in Nessau  They let me  But you watch everybody  From all the other slots  They peek their head around  Like, what the hell  Somebody's got a cannon  Is he firing  That is a  It's a 50 caliber pistol  Yeah  It's the Arnold Schwarzenegger one  From that  Yeah  The guy that I got it from  You know, he said  Dude, don't ever shoot anybody  In your house with this  It's not the most practical gun 
[03:10:00]  Wait until they go outside  It's going to ruin everything  Because it will make a mess  It's not the most practical gun to have  But it is a lot of fun  I'm not worried about the killing  I'm worried about the cleanup  The mess  You shoot a melon with that thing  And it just  You can't find out  It explodes  It's fantastic  Wow, it's fun to shoot  Yeah, it is  Is it heavy?  Yeah, it's heavy  Yeah, it's heavy  Very 
[03:10:30]  And you put a full magazine in there  Because the shells are really, really big  Really big  You could bludgeon  So you could do some damage  With just beating someone  Yeah, you don't have to shoot anybody  You don't have to shoot the damn thing  Speaking of  We've got to ask you, man  Speaking of shooting  Well, we learned about you yesterday  You got shot in the heart  Yeah  Jesus  Holy fuck  How'd that happen?  The story is insane  Really mad woman  Yeah  Really?  Yeah  You know, and she had the pistol  And it was  I learned a very good life lesson from that 
[03:11:00]  I held my hand out like this  And I said, give me that pistol  Or I'm going to take it away from you  And beat your goddamn brains out with it  Oh  And she stuck it under my arm  And pulled the trigger  A bullet went in here  And came out here  Wow  It went  Straight across the chest cavity  Went through both of my lungs  Did you think that was it?  Was it right in your chest?  You know, when something like that happens  You just, you know  You don't think  You know, I just remember thinking  That it was brand new Berber carpet 
[03:11:30]  And I thought  If I bleed on this carpet  She's going to shoot me again  Holy Christ  So I went to a room  That had tile floor  And laid down there to die  It's amazing what you think  Oh my God  Wow  How close were you to dying?  Huh?  How close were you?  I don't know  You know, they life flighted me  To the trauma center  At Vanderbilt University Medical Center  They saved my life  Yeah  It was  Had it not been for that trauma center there  I wouldn't be here  Did she call 911?  She did  She did  Yeah  Yeah  She did 
[03:12:00]  And he never pressed charges  Well, I got a good, clean divorce  Out of the deal  Wow  You know what?  You know what?  After my divorce  I would rather have been shot  I think  It would have been less painful  Now we understand  Financially viable  Because we're like  How do you not press charges?  Well, he answered that question  That is a good  It was cheaper  That's a good chip  To bring into the courtroom with you  Oh yeah  And by the way  Right  Let's not forget  Yeah 
[03:12:30]  Wow  No, no  It didn't go to court  Yeah, yeah  Wow  That is something  You must have really pissed her off  Yeah, yeah  I did  I really did  Tom's taking her side  I love it  It's like  Hey, Trace  What'd you do?  Trace, I'll be remiss  If I said  Just enjoy a boyfriend  My body is covered with scars  And I deserved every one of them  Every one of them, huh?  I'm not going to sit here  And try to  Say anything  An oil rig accident  Is rarely just  Hey, someone got a  Band-Aid 
[03:13:00]  Oh, yeah  Over there  It usually ends up being pretty  Yeah, I got a scar here  You know, I busted my ribs  And, you know, my elbows  I've had to operate on  Because I was jacking the pipe  And the derrick, you know  And I wore my elbows out  And so  I'm all used up  But, you know  Was that good money at the time?  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Better than what I make now  I make hundreds of dollars a year now  Fuck, man  Oh, damn  Were you playing music the whole time you were out there? 
[03:13:30]  Or did that come out later?  No, yeah  I was playing guitar and trying to write  Stuff when I was out there  Yeah, I started  My old man got me guitar when I was 10  I don't really know why he did it  He didn't play  So that's when I started  Oh, wow  And what was the big break there  That got you off the rig?  My second wife wanted to move  Far away from my first wife  Because they didn't get along at all  Yeah  So we moved 
[03:14:00]  And she said, let's move  I can't stand her  And I was like, okay  I don't really like her that much either  Where you want to go?  And I said, let's just go to Nashville  I said, you know  I like to sing and play  And maybe I can make something happen  Were you knocking around the clubs over there in Nashville?  Yeah, I played clubs there for about three years  You got a lot of bars  I was working construction and playing  You got to have a day gig in Nashville too  Yeah, yeah  And you just kind of played clubs in the same way  Until someone notices 
[03:14:30]  Yeah, I played the club circuit in Texas for about five years  In the southwest, Texas, New Mexico  You know, Oklahoma  I played that circuit for five years  Did you enjoy it?  Was it fun?  Yeah, I did  I really did enjoy it  And it finally got to a point where  I faced myself in the mirror one morning  And said, you know what?  Five years ago  I wouldn't even have hung out with somebody like you  Because I'd gotten really strung out  And it was, you know  I had to get away from it  Go back to the oil field to save my life  Wow, really? 
[03:15:00]  Wow  Damn  Too much partying  That's some perspective  That's what strung out means  Yeah  For you from the Liberace movie  Which one of you Nancys  Doesn't like maple in my ice cream anyway?  Oh boy, I don't know  Who said that?  Sam, was that you?  Somebody said it  Oh, Sam  Saying he doesn't like maple  Yeah, I don't know who said that, Trace  That would be crazy to say in front of you  We just assumed  With everything you have going on in your life  You were probably head of the maple producers  Coalition or something 
[03:15:30]  Hey, let me write that down  Yeah, write that down  We're all big fans of maple  Right in  Yeah, yeah  This is where it starts  Now stop  Trace  You're an oil rig guy  You're a badass  How the hell did you end up  With maple macadamia mashup?  We're going to stop to it today  Okay  We're going to stop to it  Let me tell you where I'm at  In my life right now, man  Yes  I have prostitutes coming up to me  Going, dude  The shit you're doing for money 
[03:16:00]  Is just  You know what I mean?  How can you live with yourself?  And I don't disagree  I have no pride anymore  You know what, though  I'm just like Quinn  We sold our dignity a long time ago  And I sold mine cheap  I don't know about him  I gotta say, though  The all-star apprentice ice cream here  From Trace  The maple macadamia mashup  Proceeds going to the Red Cross  The American Red Cross 
[03:16:30]  See, that's pretty goddamn good  Right there  You can't totally say you sold out  And then also  Your Wounded Warrior Project work  Is amazing  Well, that's been a privilege  Absolutely, right?  You know  The association with them  Has just been  Just something that has  Just been a humbling experience for me  I've been doing that for a few years now  Just a great organization  We hope you win Celebrity Apprentice  I do, too  You just told Penn that yesterday  No, no  I don't even  I don't even know  No, I said it after we looked at his backstory 
[03:17:00]  That we have to go with this guy  I did say that  I changed my opinion  Even though he's a really good friend of ours  But how do you not root for a guy like this?  Penn's a really good friend of mine, too  Yeah, but Penn has a sex dungeon  That's all he's got going for him  How is the Midwest going to appreciate a magician with a sex dungeon?  Right, we're going all American with this one  What bars they go to when you work on the oil wigs?  Don't you guys have like a group of bars  You go and you get into a little flack with the local  Didn't you see Armageddon?  What's wrong with you?  No, of course they do  You didn't see Armageddon? 
[03:17:30]  No  Bunch of roughnecks out there in space  I don't like those kind of movies  Did you watch that, Trace?  And just go, get out of here  I could have done that, stupid  I could have done that  You know, it was one of the most ridiculous movies  Let's meet the real oil wiggers  We got Guy Fieri outside, too  So I don't know what to do  Oh, Jesus  I saw him the other day  What are you guys doing?  Sheriff, Colin, you can't do that  I'm sitting right here  That's Fieri's manager  That's a big, look how big that is  That is a big son of a bitch right there  He might be taller than you, Trace 
[03:18:00]  He is tall  I met him yesterday, he's taller than me  Here's Guy Fieri  Guy Fieri, rock and roll, ACDC  For those about to rock  Right on his fucking chest, baby  What's up, Guy?  Good to see you, buddy  You know Trace?  I just met him the other day  God, is he tall?  Yeah, he's tall  Yeah, he's tall as your manager  Yeah, your manager's pretty goddamn tall  But he's not rocking a cowboy hat and boots  Yeah, true  He's in Nikes and a golf shirt  Yeah, yeah, yeah  No, I saw him, we met the other day  And what a great guy  And you've hit the tour, man 
[03:18:30]  You've been all over  Well, that's what they make you do  When you have a new album come out  And they make you go dance for Granny  The girls are going nuts at that show  I can imagine  Like, hey, I'm here, I'm cooking  I'm making some food  You were cooking at one of his shows?  I should have been cooking at one of his shows  It would have been  No, we were  We were doing one of the morning shows  Oh, okay  It's a pretty good time  So we were standing out there grilling  And talking about food and the whole thing  And he's from Louisiana  Knives, we were talking about knives  We were talking about knives  You've got to respect the guy that's got his own line of cutlery 
[03:19:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah  We were just looking at that  Knuckle sandwich knives  That's all right  He's got a great name  Flames on him  Big sharp blade  Right, Cobb?  Great name for his knives  Yes, indeed  Guy, do you remember when we met?  Austin, Texas  Really?  Colin Quinn?  Colin makes a face like  Nah  You recognize me  Austin, Texas  He's so proud of himself that he remembered something  Did you see that?  That look on his face  That was awesome  He had a senior moment  He was like, I remembered something 
[03:19:30]  Come on  I know exactly  Senior moment  Magnolia bakery treats, Guy  CQ, who else?  Nice  You also switched spots with Tom Papa  Yeah, I think Tom felt a little like, you know  Tom should be on the couch  Quite frankly  No, I  I was like, Colin Quinn was to be up there  But Guy and I go way back also  I want an expert opinion  Oh, try some of that ice cream  Get up here, man  I don't care if y'all tried  I want him to try  Yeah, exactly  He's an expert  Yeah, guys, try the maple  He's the expert  What is this called?  Moonshine mashup 
[03:20:00]  See, I tell you  There would have been a little moonshine in this  I think these are great  Well, we know  Yo, the mad Cuban's in here, too  No, you're not  The mad Cuban  We love him  He's a character  You were the one who introduced us to him  And now he does our show  That's maple-y  It has a butterscotch-y taste to it  It's very good  And it's good  And it's pretty good  Yeah, I know  I hope you should try something  Shut the front door  What's all guys do?  You know, and I just thought  You know, Penn, he did  He went way out there  And mixed vanilla and chocolate  Did you just call him out on that? 
[03:20:30]  I think so  Did you just call him out on that?  I did a maple macadamia  Which my young lady  They called her an ice cream wizard  She said that  As far as she knew  That hadn't been done  I'll tell you  I had Penn's yesterday  And he's got salt in his  He's got a sea salt  It's got a little flea salt in it  With salt and the counterbalance  To the sugar  I mean, it really plays nicely  And he had big chunks of chocolate  And kind of a bittersweet chocolate  But I'm not a huge chocolate guy 
[03:21:00]  Oh  This right here  Reminds me of like  Pralines and cream  That macadamia nut  Survives in there  A lot of times  The nuts  Kind of get  You know, they kind of get crushed  And they're a little soft  And they don't have any texture  This has great texture  It's not overly sweet  You think maple  And I'm like  Oh boy  Someone's going to go crazy  With the Mrs. Butterworth  But this has got a good balance  She kept coming to me  And I would say  And I would say  Come on  Give me some more maple  And she kept cranking up  The maple intensity  I thought I may have  Gone a little too far with it  You think it's alright? 
[03:21:30]  It's almost too much  Can you ship  Can you ship this  To people's houses?  I mean  Or can you only buy  Dwayne Reed  And Walgreens  Yeah  Walgreens  Is it only in New York  They carry it?  No  It's everywhere  I'm nationwide  National  National  Right?

[03:30:00]  Buddy  I was the wrangler  Are you going to bring  The hardware  That's right  What  You going to bring  The hardware  I don't think  I could bring my piece  Why not  Eh you cross state lines  Everything's fucked up  It's not Smokey and the Bandit  You can't do that  I had one on the bus  One time I forgot about  It was in my  Nightstand by my bed  And then we crossed the border  Going into Canada  And they put me in jail  Oh they did lock you up  Yeah they locked me up  For six hours  They locked me up  For about six hours  Shouldn't they know  How do they come on  And handcuff you  Is what I want to know  No shit  Well how's your job  Is that  Get on there  And get him 
[03:30:30]  No I copped to it  Immediately  Because it was like  Border crossing  Trainee day  And so they were just  Like going through everything  Oh man  So I immediately said  Okay wait  I forgot about something  And I told them  Where it was  And then they just  Hut hut hut hut hut hut hut  Shouldn't they take things like that  Into consideration  And know that it's like  Look it's Trace Atkins  He's not going to  Fucking be  Blasting off in Canada  With this gun  It was an honest mistake  You know as opposed to  Somebody you know  Is trying to commit  Some kind of real crime  Right  It was weird  And then when they gave me 
[03:31:00]  My pistol  It was a little 380 automatic  Wasn't a big deal  But they handed it back to me  And they had  Completely disassembled it  So it was just all  In pieces  And I had to walk  I had to walk back  Across the border  And mail it home  They wouldn't let me  Drive back across  Wow  Wow  So now do you have  A weapons charge on you  In Canada or something  No  But that's why  They really got mad  Because I had a  Weapons charge here  Oh  Oh boy  I like the fact  That every question  Trace answers  Is like another story 
[03:31:30]  Really  Just leads to another  A whole story  I love it  We were shipping the Camaro  We used for Triple D  Across the border  And I'd just been at a  Just was at Kid Rock's place  Doing a shoot  Oh God  And we loaded it up  We loaded it up  A whole  Uh oh  You don't like the beer  Or you don't like Rock?  They found guns  And dope  And women  In the trunk of the car  So we loaded it up  He makes this great beer  He makes this great beer  And we had it on the show  And I wanted to take some 
[03:32:00]  Back to California  So I threw it  In the trunk of my Camaro  Well I just happened to forget  The Camaro was on its way  To Canada  So I get a call  From this driver  Stressing out  There is  There's beer  In the back of your car  Where the hell  Did that come from?  Yeah I don't know  Oh shit  But they actually  They let it go  They let the car  Come into Canada  Cruise around  With the 10 cases  And cruise back out  Oh okay  Did they know  No weapons charge  No weapons  Yeah  You gotta watch that  I hate the fact that  You know you go  From one state to another  And you're fucking  Your gun's good here  It's not good here  You're responsible  And we trust you 
[03:32:30]  And you went through  All the hoops here  Like in New York  You gotta go through so much  I should be able to cover  Every goddamn state  In the Union  But you know  I can't drive across Jersey  Unless it's in a locked box  Separate from the ammo  You're not stopping  Until you get to Pennsylvania  You know shit like that  Which is really stupid  Because then if someone  Steals the car  Instead of the gun  Being on you  Where you have possession of it  And know where it is  And it's not gonna get  In anyone else's hands  Now someone's got your gun  And your car  The laws make no sense  They punish the law abiding citizen 
[03:33:00]  Do nothing to make anyone safer  Where is this coming from?  I've never heard you talk like this  Exactly  Do you know  A New Yorker just got arrested  A New Yorker just got arrested  Because of the new law  That only allows seven rounds  In your magazine  And he had ten  Because he had a ten round mag  Right right right  And he got pulled over  He had this pistol on a seat  A Stady  Pulled him over  And looked  Saw the gun  The guy says  Yes I completely legal  I got this  The trooper checked  The magazine  Found that there were  You know  Three more too many bullets 
[03:33:30]  Or two  I think it was a nine round mag  That he had  So it was only two extra balls  And arrested him  And now the guy's got  A weapons charge  On him because of that  How did that make anyone  Any safer?  How did that law  Just make New York  A safer place to live  Because a guy  That legally owns a gun  Has all the permit  Had two bullets too many  In his magazine  The laws are ridiculous  Talkie boy Cuomo  Yeah well  The gun charge I had  Was a similar kind of thing  I wasn't doing anything 
[03:34:00]  Illegal  I had a pistol  And it was in the  In my boot  Pocket of  The door of my truck  And at the time  I didn't have a permit  Carry permit  But anyway  So the pistol was there  In the door  And it was loaded  Of course  And I got pulled over  For something else  And the guy looks  And he goes  Is that gun loaded?  And I said  Is your gun loaded?  Yeah it's loaded  You know  I carry it as a paperweight  There are two useless  Things in this world  A dull knife  And an empty gun  You know 
[03:34:30]  Love it  So  He said assume  The position  And took me  Directly to jail  But that's my gun charge  I mean I didn't  You know  I didn't like  What state was that in?  What state was that in?  That was Tennessee  Tennessee wow  Now I have a carry permit  Tennessee  In Tennessee  So they're all cool with it  If you hook up  Like fucking Ted Nugent  They like deputize him  And he could carry  Anywhere in the country  A bazooka  You gotta get that  Well I like the fact  That Trace doesn't think  He's getting arrested  He's like  Hey officer  There's two useless  Things in this world  A dull knife 
[03:35:00]  And an unloaded gun  Instead of going  It's loaded sir  But I'm on my way  You're free to go  What did you tell him  Hey fuck you  You're not gonna do  Nothing about it  It's loaded  No he did  He asked me  He said  Is that gun loaded sir  And I said  Hell is your gun loaded?  You know  I mean  Come on man  Yeah it's loaded  Absolutely  Why would you  Six steps out of the truck  What I look like  I'm in a Liberace movie  Hey hey  I got caught  Stealing bubble yum once 
[03:35:30]  And they put me in the back  And my dad had to come get me  Wow that is frightening  Hard time  Trace has lived  The life here  Man  The whole  The work ethic  The getting hurt  On a real man's job  Right  The country music star  Weapons charges  Jesus Christ  It's fantastic  How are we gonna tell Penn Jillette  That we're not rooting for him anymore  I know  Should we call him  I'm all in with Trace now  And this is fantastic  Yeah look  It's trying the ice cream  Now it's a little mushy 
[03:36:00]  See it's wonderful  Oh that's good  We probably should take a break  You know what  Get Trace out  I gotta go anyway  This should be good on Waffles  This should be great on Waffles  I gotta go to Atlantic City  And hang out with my peeps  Atlantic City  Where do you stay when you go there?  I don't stay anywhere there  I go  I go there  In and out  I go there  And they give me money  And I leave  Oh okay  I gotta go do a show tonight  At Caesars there  Caesars in AC  Can we play one of your new songs?  That'd be cool  I didn't come over here  Just to talk to you  No we're gonna do it though 
[03:36:30]  He throws a smack down  No matter what he says  You're that close  From getting punched in the face  He is  He is a very intimidating guy  Authentic  Say no to a woman  Or watch the world end  Say no to a woman  Watch the world end  It's a really sappy love song  I did with Colby Calais  It's beautiful  But it's not good for this show  Nothing beautiful is good for this show  I don't know if any of the songs  On this album are good for this show  You should go back  And do something off

[03:39:00]  The worst is yet to come  This is ONA's worst of 2013  On the OPN Anthony channel  ONA's worst of 2013  Worst of 2013  Celebrity Apprentice  We haven't talked to you since  I know  And not what I heard  How the fuck do you lose to that guy  First of all  I tell you  Have Trace on  He's a good guy  You'll have a good time  Didn't I tell you that  We ended up really liking him 
[03:39:30]  Right  But totally liking him  To the point  We pull you off  I go to that show  My show that night  And they go  I thought ONA liked you  And I go  Yeah we get along great  What was it  They go  Well they're telling Trace  He's gonna win  And fuck you  And they're  I go what  And they said  I said they didn't say  His ice cream was better  No  They said  They said well  They didn't say it was worse  I said what's wrong  With those fuckers  How long have I been your friend  I know  How many times  Have I tickled your ball sack  With my dog  Can I break this down for you 
[03:40:00]  Okay break it down  Your ice cream was way the fuck better  Way the fuck better  To the point  I continued buying  Even  Fuck yeah  We didn't even have to  We didn't even have to buy it anymore  I was still buying it  No one has to discuss that  No one thinks  No one in the world thinks  It's better  But quite honestly  Your personal story  Wasn't as impressive as his  What's his personal story  He got shot in the heart  And lived  We weren't competing  On being in the wrong place  When a bullet's being fired  Are you telling me  It's the smarter person 
[03:40:30]  That gets shot  Through the fucking heart  He actually has  Real bullets shot at  Fuck yeah  No see  The goal in life  Is the one who gets hurt  The less wins  That's true  What the fuck is wrong  With you people  And then  And he was funnier than me  I suppose  On the fucking show  No  No no no  Okay  But he had better stories  You've been shot at many times  That's true  Fake shot  No but I have been  Oh come on  I've also been really shot at  I've really had a gun  Pulled on me twice  Oh man  And it was not fired  And I consider that to be  Because I handled the situation 
[03:41:00]  Better  Better than Trace  Better  I'll just give you  A little piece of advice  Getting shot  Worse than not getting shot  I gotta agree with that  So let's see  Trace is a better talker than me  Yeah  Smarter than me  Oh no  Better ice cream than me  You wouldn't believe  It wasn't me  Right  And I got really  Let me tell you this  In the celebrity apprentice world  Yeah  You get sucked into that  Scrooge McDuck  Fucking wacko shit  You get sucked into it  And you believe it  Right  So the final thing  Is coming down  I come on 
[03:41:30]  Do my buddies  They're really supportive  I'm feeling great  Right  Great  I go to do a show  In wherever the fuck it was  New Jersey  Right  And I'm feeling pretty good  About myself  Sure  And I'm out signing autographs  After the show  Like a thousand people  Want to sign my autograph  Right  And guy number five  Goes  Man  Oh and they sold you out  And I go  What do you mean  They go  Oh  They were saying that  Trace should win  Trace was the winner  Oh my god  They were  He's never even been on the show before 
[03:42:00]  And they go  Oh they love him  They just sold you right down  We're easy  We're easy  I go  Okay  Well this guy's a nut  Right  Because you get nuts  Yes  Sure  Of course  You'll get nuts  Signed another 10  15 autographs  Uh huh  Whoa  Did you hear O&A  Oh no  What do you mean  I hear O&A  Oh they sure love Trace man  They were sucking his dick  Okay  You bunch of fucking rats out there  Is what you are  Okay  Let me just bring the whole thing  The whole thing to an end  Just a misunderstanding  Yeah yeah  Take all the jokes out  And everything  Okay  We finished signing 
[03:42:30]  About a thousand people  Yeah  I'm standing there  We sign outside  Yeah  A thousand people have left  I'm standing there  Picking up my markers  Picking up my water  Glenn comes over  Glenn goes  You okay  And I go  I'm a little bummed  It's stupid  But I'm a little bummed  Oh no  He says  What  What  Why  Why  And I go  I heard that like O&A  Were saying that  Trace should win  And he says  You know that this game  Doesn't mean anything to you 
[03:43:00]  You don't give a fuck  I said  I don't give a fuck  But it just feels  I feel like I've just gone through  Some sort of weird breakup  I'm really bummed  And he says to me  Well you know  It's all the pressure of the show  You've been working hard  You haven't been sleeping  And I said  It was like five people  He said  I'm sure it's a misunderstanding  I'm gonna call tomorrow  And the next day  He says to me  Yeah  I guess they do  Oh no  Hold on  I do have two other points here  First of all  With the Trace Atkins  What impressed us 
[03:43:30]  He gets shot in the heart  By his wife or girlfriend  At the time  And he doesn't scream  And he's just relaxed  And goes  Alright call 911  No but  That's in the story  What  It was impressive  But that's in the story  It's impressive  Yeah  It doesn't mean it happened that way  Well we're gullible  We believe half your tricks  They're not tricks  Sorry sorry  But and here's the other thing  They're swindles  Here's the other thing  About Celebrity Apprentice  That blew me away for real  I saw the finale  Okay  Because I was rooting for you 
[03:44:00]  In the end  You know that  Oh I don't know that  Say that again  We are rooting for you  Okay well do you mean it  I was hoping you won  But his goddamn story  Was like oh god  Yeah  It's like he made it up  To win  Yes  Precisely my point  He had to make up  For the fact that  His ice cream was horrendous  Horrendous  Horrendous  It was horrible  It was terrible  But then this is what  I learned by watching  The finale  Because you're on it  That's the only reason  I watched  Thank you  And your new boyfriend  Trace was also 
[03:44:30]  He is dreamy  And the whole thing  He is dreamy  He's better looking than me  And I would think  I would think  That if any two guys  Would not go for better looking  It would be you too  There you go  So but here's my point  The whole season  Was a ruse  Yes  Because Donald Trump  Hated you from day one  Because of what you wrote  What you wrote in your book  About him  Oh that's right  He called you out  So he was never going to  Let you win anyway  No  Do people know this  He said it on the air  He said it on the air  Well so I'm telling the people  That maybe didn't watch the finale 
[03:45:00]  He basically said  That he doesn't like you  Because of what you wrote  About him in your book  That's what he said  And then he said  Do you want to apologize  And I said no  Thank you  When someone says to you  Do you want to apologize  It's the moment of truth  Right  That's the crossroad  And then I'm sitting there going  He had no intention  Of having you win ever  No  There was no intention  And there was actually fights  With Walgreens  And the producers  Who wanted me to win 
[03:45:30]  Right  And they were  They were much more pissed  Than I was  Yeah because they could have  Sold a lot more ice cream  If you want  Because in the end  It was a much better product  And the other thing  That I can't  I can't tell you who  But people involved  In the production  Who were so embarrassed  Ended up giving me  That amount of money  For the charity  Wow they did  Yeah  Good for you  They just said  This was kind of bullshit  Let's write you  Well that's good  So Opportunity Village  Made a metric shit ton of money  Well I hope we 
[03:46:00]  Straighten this all out  And you came out to Vegas  I came out to Vegas  And you didn't wear  Your baseball hat  No  And you're absolutely  Unrecognizable  He did not even  Recognize me  And I knew he was there  That's our biggest fear though  When you guys finally  Give us an invite  We show up and like  Oh he doesn't even know  No no  Once I knew you  I treated  I greeted you  A great deal of joy  You came back with  Great stories  How you treated him  It was fantastic  And the show itself  Is just amazing  I loved it  I can't believe  That your baseball hat  Is what I recognize 
[03:46:30]  I know  I didn't have the hat on  Because you know  It's a classy jerk  I don't want to be  In a classy jerk  With a hat on  But what a great time  And the show  Was so much fun  To watch man  Someone came to the show  You know  And said  Vegas  After the show  They said to me  So  You still hang out  With Trace  And I said  Well he's  Playing golf  With my wife  Right now  And he comes out  And stays in the house  And plays golf  All the time  And hangs out  And then my family  Is going out  To visit his family  We get along great  And we have no 
[03:47:00]  There's no problems  Between me and Trace  Except you too  Yes  I said  Why the fuck  Did ONA suck up  I expected  You know  I told you  To put him on  I told you  He'd be good  And I expected you  To be cordial  Polite  Very very  Complimentary  And then for one of you  I don't even care  Which fucking one  You know  Either the whop  Or the other one  Either one of you  Either Opie  You know  One of you would say  Listen man 
[03:47:30]  You're really great  But you know  Penn's been on the show  Forever  We got you to know  That we're rooting for him  His ice cream  Is a little better  But listen man  You are great  You are fabulous  Was that said  It's ever said  Yeah  I mean we did  Yeah  We did feel a little guilty  No it wasn't  We felt a little guilty  It wasn't said  We felt a little guilty  After the show  I think we might have a clip  Is it short though  I don't want to waste  Penn's time  With a long clip  Yeah it's short  Alright a short clip  From that day  Oh no  We hope you win  Celebrity Apprentice  True too  You just told Penn that 
[03:48:00]  Yesterday  No no  I don't even  I don't even know  No I said it  After we looked at  His back story  That we have to go  With this guy  I did say that  I changed my opinion  Even though he's  A really good friend of ours  But how do you not  Roof for a guy like this  Penn's a really good  Friend of mine too  Yeah but Penn has  A sex dungeon  That's all he's got  Going for him  That's the Midwest  Wow  You know what the  Most important part  Of that whole clip was  After Judas Iscariot  Over here  Kisses me on the 
[03:48:30]  Fucking cheek  He then  Three sentences later  Says  He is a friend of ours  And then  This fuck  Beams in his chair  And points to me  Like see  After I said  I wanted you to lose  I said you were  My friend  See I'm an okay guy  You know if you'd have  Sat there with your  Head down in shame  Like the fucking  Piece of shit you are  It would have been better  But it's the point  And the smile  I'm sweating  Point and the smile  I'm sweating  That was  That was really telling 
[03:49:00]  I'm actually sweating  You didn't have to  Interpret that clip much  To see what  He meant by it  Which was  I hope Trace was  See  We're okay  I said we're  He's a good friend  Of mine  He's a good friend  Of mine  He's a good friend  Of mine  Okay  And since when  Does New York  Back Louisiana  Over Massachusetts  Since when  Has that happened  In any sort  Of jingoistic  Tribalistic thing  You're right  Eyes are on my side 
[03:49:30]  But I never said  Your ice cream  I stuck to the point  That your ice cream  Was better  Thank you  Although friendship  Doesn't matter to you  Gluttony does  Penn  I don't want to  Throw Opie  Completely under the bus  Here  But I have to say something  Did you hear me  In the background  Yes I did  I said  Opie  Oh my god  You were saying that  To Penn  You phony  Load of shit  He was there  I was backing Penn  The whole time  Let me practice this  So you know  I love you guys  And Opie and Anthony
