<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly between segments.  It began with a discussion about multiple DVD releases of films, specifically the Star Wars special editions, with Opie and Anthony expressing their frustration at unnecessary extras.  Kevin Smith called in, offering a more accepting view of George Lucas's alterations.  The conversation devolved into vulgar jokes and anecdotes, including a sexually explicit description involving a power drill.  Smith also discussed his film *Jersey Girl* and its negative reception, blaming Jennifer Lopez's involvement.

Dom Morena then joined the show, sharing personal stories about infidelity and a relationship with a much younger woman, the discovery of which caused issues with his wife. He interspersed personal anecdotes with jokes from his stand-up routine.  The hosts also discussed their experiences with satellite radio, the lack of censorship, and the difficulties of filling airtime without commercials, touching on their struggles in booking A-list celebrities like George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and Johnny Depp.  They emphasized their preference for guests who fit their comedic style over pure star power.  The segment ended with further discussion about booking guests and a bizarre aside about a perpetually open bathroom window.

The show then shifted to a graphic and detailed discussion of the bathroom facilities at their previous workplace.  This included numerous anecdotes about a janitor nicknamed "Richard Dreyfuss with AIDS," detailed descriptions of coworkers' bathroom habits (including sex in the bathroom and stairwell), and vulgar language describing bodily functions and sexual encounters. A blind caller, Krista, participated using a screen reader, generating humorous responses.  A heated and offensive exchange with a caller from Cleveland followed.  The segment ended with Opie displaying a pickled fetus, sparking further discussion and attempts to return it to its owner.

The next segment focused on smoking bans and the perceived loss of freedom in America.  The hosts lamented the closure of smoking lounges and cigar bars, using Iraq as a hyperbolic example of greater freedom. They jokingly discussed absurd regulations and a new method of inhaling atomized alcohol.  A significant portion was dedicated to mocking Regis Philbin's music CD with highly offensive and sexually explicit commentary. Krista called again, praising a (largely undefined) segment about girls and video games.  Jay from Cleveland made another offensive prank call, met with similarly offensive responses from the hosts. Opie then described his own illness, including a graphic anecdote involving a McMuffin and syrup. They also discussed a news story about a used condom baked into a muffin.  Comedian Steven Lynch joined the show in studio, performing songs including "Full-Blown AIDS," "To Kill a Kitten," and "Altar Boy," all with highly profane lyrics.  He also performed "Special Ed," a song about a mentally challenged individual. Lynch discussed his past performances, his tour with Mitch Hedberg, and his new DVD.  He also performed a new song about his racial preferences in romantic partners.

The conversation shifted to their new, unfinished studio, past experiences with readily available alcohol, and their recollections of the period immediately following 9/11.  A caller complained about XM radio signal issues, prompting joking and offensive comments from the hosts about Harlem. They expressed disgust at 9/11 commemorative coins, with Opie recounting destroying a display of 9/11 photos at Ground Zero.  A listener called in with information about the coins’ origins.  More off-color jokes and stories followed Lynch's performance of "Kill a Kitten". They discussed a previous guest's self-esteem and a woman who went on a date with Jim Norton.  

The show concluded with a lengthy discussion of a "Shit Dick" sign and sexually explicit pictures in their studio, which offended a representative from a Broadway channel.  The hosts reacted defensively and dismissively, using homophobic and other offensive language. They mocked the complainant's sensitivity, contrasted their studio's atmosphere with a typical office, and recounted their interactions with their superiors, who ultimately sided with them.  They admitted to being "dickheads," jokingly referenced other potentially offensive studio elements, and played their song "Shit Dick," defending their creative space and ultimately expressing a lack of concern for workplace standards. A Jägermeister advertisement was also aired.

[00:00:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:04:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:05:00]  Well, before that, you know, you go on vacation, you're in a hotel, look what's on TV.  There you go.  Got to, you know, rent that.  Might have to rent that one for the night on the Still in Theaters section of the hotel television.  Then the DVD comes out.  Then the DVD comes out.  Then the DVD comes out.  You've got to get it on DVD.  Before you even buy it, you rent it.  Before you even buy it, you rent it.  Right.  You rent it.  You rent it at Blockbuster.  Oh, my God.  So how many levels are we up to?  I don't know.  But a while after that, you decide, God, that was a good movie.  I think I'll buy it for my DVD collection. 
[00:05:30]  So you go out and you buy it.  And you think it ends there, right, Anthony?  You would think it ends there, but no.  It finally ends.  It never ends.  You probably spend close to $100 on each movie at this point.  Right.  At least, you know, the good movies, the Blockbusters.  Probably $100.  And it's not over yet.  Just because you own the DVD doesn't mean it's over.  Because now they put out a more gooder DVD.  One with the commentary and interviews and making of and behind the scenes and docudrama. 
[00:06:00]  Special edition.  Special edition.  Special edition.  Director's cut.  Digitally remastered.  What?  Now you have to buy it again.  Again.  I am so tired of this.  They're brilliant, though.  They figured out a way to make you pay for a movie multiple times.  To buy the same stuff over and over and over.  Imagine if they could do that with a...  Just go to jail, bitch!  Sorry.  If they could do that with a wrench.  Just selling a wrench at Sears.  You buy a wrench and they put out the same wrench, but it's a special edition wrench, so you buy it again. 
[00:06:30]  It would never work.  But with DVDs, oh, I've got to get this.  I've got to get it again.  It's special edition.  So I'm buying the same stuff.  And I'm the worst.  I will just go out and buy it.  I heard, what was it?  Goodfellas.  I own Goodfellas.  I watch it many times.  They put out a special edition.  I had to get the goddamn special edition.  Clerks now.  Kevin Smith is putting out a special 10th anniversary of Clerks.  Does anyone really enjoy the extras, though?  In general.  Every once in a while, there's a good one that comes out where you have to check out the commentary and the extras and all that. 
[00:07:00]  But in general, it's usually crap.  I'm very into the behind-the-scenes stuff, but I understand what you're saying.  A lot of people don't care.  They show the stills of the costumes they're making.  Who the F cares?  Man, let me tell you, the Lord of the Rings DVDs, there were so many extras, and some of them really good.  They did a really good job on documenting the filming of all those movies.  So the documentary part was really good.  If you're into knowing how the special effects work and everything, they had separate sections on just the special effects of the movie, which was great. 
[00:07:30]  But, yeah, there's a section of photos and costumes and storyboards.  They're little sketches.  I don't want to go through the storyboards of the entire movie and watch a sketch of every shot.  You know, that's not really entertaining.  Need not be on the DVD.  And now, the latest thing that I bought is the Star Wars DVDs.  This Lucas should be shot.  He's changed things around. 
[00:08:00]  He pops in new scenes.  He takes out old scenes.  Because what happened to the original Star Wars, where you look back with a little bit of nostalgia?  You remember going into the movies and seeing it for the first time.  I want to see it like that.  So the special effects look really fake these days.  And you know something?  So what? The stormtrooper bangs his head as he's coming in to fight.  I like that.  He slips on the floor.  What's on the floor?  And they left it in.  You know what?  I like that.  And the special effects, if you look back at the time and realize when the movie was made, you go, wow, that was really good for the time. 
[00:08:30]  You know?  I think they used little models back then.  A lot of models, right?  They didn't have the CGI where you could just...  They didn't have the green screens and...  Yeah, they would use them with models and stuff, which is fine.  They just didn't have the computer where you make it in a computer.  You make the ships in a computer.  Models on fishing line, I do believe.  That's what they did.  And they put the models out there and you...  Slide them down a fishing line. 
[00:09:00]  There you go.  Real explosions blowing up the little model.  Yeah.  They put pyrotechnics in there and now everything's done digitally.  And for some reason, George Lucas figured, hey, I can make the movie better by putting in CGI now.  So completely out of place and not needed are these creatures walking around where they weren't before.  I want the Star Wars I remember watching.  That's what I want.  Oh, leave George Lucas alone. 
[00:09:30]  Kevin, how are you, buddy?  What's up, guys?  It's Kevin Smith, our first real celebrity on the Opie and Anthony show.  Thank God.  What?  Do you mean Moore hasn't been on the show yet?  Not yet.  No, not yet.  He's waiting for last comic standing to end and then he'll be back with us, I'm sure.  Kevin, I know you're a big Star Wars fan.  Oh, yeah.  What do you think of the special edition?  I'm just happy to have it on DVD.  See, the son of a bitch made you happy that it's out on DVD at all. 
[00:10:00]  Totally.  I'm not one of them.  You know, I'm just, I'm total Uncle Tom for George Lucas.  You're not a purist, one of those?  Because I've read the reviews where it either gets four stars or one star.  There's nothing in between.  And the people that give it one star are so pissed off that he's added things in and taken things out that they cannot handle it.  They're ready to kill themselves.  I just, to me, I don't know.  It's his movies, right?  So let him, if he wants to add stuff and if he feels it's a continuing work in progress that he can update every ten years and the technology jumps, let him do it. 
[00:10:30]  Makes him happy.  I don't know.  Have you, are you saying this because you've superimposed some CGI on Clerks?  Basically, in Clerks 10, we include the scene where Greedo shoots first.  See, now that is a perfect example.  Now, you can't even be into that.  No, I was never into that.  That was the dumbest thing.  I really don't like because I thought it was, even as a kid, I thought, oh, my God, how pimp.  When, you know, Han Solo shoots, when he just blows his dude away, he just gives him a little grief in the canteen and he's just like, oh, fuck. 
[00:11:00]  Hey, wait a second, can we, we're on a satellite, can we curse you?  Oh, you can curse.  You can do whatever you want.  You should have heard the show earlier.  A girl was getting off with a power drill.  Getting off with a drill bit.  Was she in a church confessional at the time?  Now, that's, we'll wait a little while before we do that.  You might want to build up to that one.  Yeah.  I like how Han shot him under the table, too.  Didn't even show him the gun.  Totally.  It's like that, like you said, completely pimp.  Blows him away, pimp him, pitches the bartender a quarter. 
[00:11:30]  Well, perhaps because he's a space pirate, because the guy's supposed to be like a roving scumbag, and now, what, because George Lucas has kids, he figures he's got to make these, because he's a role model now or something, and he's got to be a do-gooder, so they change the movie?  I don't like that.  I'd be happy that George Lucas' life didn't take other turns, and instead he would have turned Han into a butt pirate.  Could you imagine that?  Instead of shooting Greedo, he just spins him around on the table face down. 
[00:12:00]  Drills him.  Totally.  What do you got coming in on Clerks 10?  Clerks 10, it's a pretty sweet DVD, as far as I'm concerned.  Three discs and lots of extras.  The best extra on that disc, though, on the whole set is this documentary that our friend Phil Benson put together, which is a 90-minute doc called The Snowball Effect.  It's kind of tough, the whole story of Clerks, like a story from me as a child all the way up to the movie getting bought. 
[00:12:30]  Really?  It's better than the movie itself, to be honest with you.  That's a hard sell right there.  One of my favorite movies, man.  Thank you, sir.  It's right up there.  And may I say made for $10.50 is what I hear.  $10, sir.  $9.  $9.35.  Very, very inexpensive movie to make.  Kevin, I want to thank you for Vulgar.  Oh, Brian Johnson's movie.  Yeah, the only movie I was ever horrified by.  The clown rape picture.  The clown rape picture. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, I remember that one, sure.  I found a copy of that, and I checked it out.  I was horrified, and nothing bothers me, by the way.  Nothing.  Total date movie.  It was...  Yeah, that's a chick flick.  We're a little distracted, because I think CBS is here, and they're setting up cameras in the studio for the next segment.  Get out of here.  CBS, so it's got to be accurate.  They want to talk to the pioneers of satellite radio.  Right.  We are the pioneers.  We are the first.  We invented satellite radio.  Basically, Dan Rout is going to come in and say you invented satellite radio.  See, that wouldn't be good for us. 
[00:13:30]  We have documents saying that, Hopi and Anthony.  We're first.  How is it?  How is it?  How is satellite radio?  It's pretty cool.  It's a trip.  It's quite different from broadcast radio.  Right.  Not just with the curses, but just the subject matter you can cover, you know?  Yeah, that's the best part of this.  You don't have to beat around the bush.  You should just say what you're feeling.  If there's a girl and she's been masturbating and we have audio of it, we can say that she's been masturbating.  We don't have to spend ten minutes trying to let everybody know what she's doing without actually saying it.  Trying to talk around it.  Yeah.  Which leaves a dilemma of coming up with more material to fill the time. 
[00:14:00]  Jesus Christ.  We actually have to prepare and do a show now.  Yeah, we have no commercials, so technically we're doing like five hours of material.  Whoa, that light's not too bright.  Whoa, that is a bright light.  Hey!  I just got a tan.  Bill Cosby would say that you guys aren't working hard enough because now you're just going to be blue, blue, blue.  Right.  We're trying to keep it under control, Kevin.  And Bill Cosby knows.  I think it's genius.  I think the idea of being able to say whatever you want on the radio finally is such an idea whose time has come a long time ago. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, what a great thought.  And when I say come, I mean C-U-M.  To be able to say what you want in America.  I mean C-U-M, come, not C-O-M-E.  Right.  Because on satellite we can talk about come.  But then, you know, we also had clever breaks today, Kevin.  It's all about balance.  There you go.  That's right.  And so do you guys have to do commercials or no?  No, that's why we're kind of just talking to you still.  We just bullshit.  We just kind of hang out and, yeah, there's plenty of time for us.  You know what they do?  When we go to break, you know, so we can get coffee or go to the bathroom, they play George Carlin bits. 
[00:15:00]  Do they really?  Yeah.  Washington doesn't know funny yet.  See what happens?  We're in New York and then when we take a break, they take the show in Washington and they just don't know funny yet.  They think George Carlin is the only funny human being ever born.  George Carlin's hysterical, by the way.  Of course, but when you hear the same bits every break, it's a little old, you know?  He's a god.  He's a total god.  Only made one bad movie in his life, Jersey Girl.  Oh, Jesus. 
[00:15:30]  I got to ask you, how pissed were you when Jigley came out and just got trashed?  You had to see something in the cards there.  You know, you sit there kind of, I was stupidly, I was going, well, America will ignore the bad movie and embrace what I felt was a good movie.  Right.  And I was partly right.  You know, like, Julie made six million, we made 25, but I don't know.  It sucked because that movie could have done, like, at least 50 million bucks.  Yeah, it just had this pawl over it because, you know, the same two people. 
[00:16:00]  And I like how you completely dropped J-Lo from any of the commercials.  Like, she wasn't even in it.  It was such an albatross around the neck.  That sucks.  I couldn't believe it.  It really, it was like Germany for the next 60 years after the Holocaust.  Yeah.  And no matter what they did, people were just like, yeah, but you did the Holocaust, remember?  And you're like, ugh.  Yeah, it doesn't matter what comes out of Germany.  It's just like, yeah, but try to live past the point of the Holocaust. 
[00:16:30]  Exactly.  Like, look, we got this kid, this little kid's amazing.  Yeah, but Bennifer's in it.  And you're like, well, but George Carlin's great, yeah, but Bennifer's in it.  Yeah, but it's Ben's best work.  Yeah, but he's half of Bennifer.  You know.  You couldn't escape it.  And then people would just trash it for the sake of trash it.  The really gratifying thing is when you read reviews, and not, you know, from critics,  of course, because they dig in on their position and stay there.  Yeah.  But, like, from people who, on our website, who would be like, you know, fuck Jersey Girl. 
[00:17:00]  And then six months later, they're like, you know what, dude?  I ran a Jersey Girl.  It's actually pretty good.  And you're like, thanks, Mom.  Thanks.  Getting pissed at the message board geeks.  Yeah.  All right, Kevin, you're going to come in and hang with us, right?  They always know what it's all about.  Yeah, I'm going to pop in.  I think in November, I'm actually going to be in New York.  I'm going out to New Jersey.  This I love.  I'm going out to New Jersey to receive an award from the New Jersey Educational Association, 
[00:17:30]  the NGEA.  Wow.  What did you do?  I was a product of the public school system that made good.  You know.  They're going to give me an award.  Isn't that great?  You get honored for something like that.  And I couldn't even go back to my high school and get my diploma.  They won't.  Like, I want to get my honorary high school diploma from my high school.  And all Anthony has to do is a gym class.  I just have to make up, like, some gym credits or something.  So I'll do some pull-ups or, you know.  He just has to climb the rope a few times and he gets his diploma and they won't let him do it.  Play some dodgeball.  I don't know.  Anything.  But they wouldn't even entertain the idea. 
[00:18:00]  A few more credits.  What was the problem?  You didn't want to go shower at the shower time during?  I was kind of one of them.  I was not the get in a room and get naked with a bunch of my pupil mates in school.  It wasn't, like, the thing I really wanted to do.  No, I'd rather be out back smoking pot.  You weren't digging the big parachute?  You wouldn't participate in the big parachute thing?  I think it was a little later than when they brought the big parachute into gym and had us flop it around.  No.  That was a lot of fun.  It was, I hated gym class.  I was never into sports or anything when I was in school. 
[00:18:30]  So I just never went to gym.  I hung out back and smoked pot.  And they never gave me a diploma.  I think I've done okay without it.  And maybe if I make a contribution to their high school radio station, maybe they'll give me a diploma.  I just feel left out.  Now you're playing the game, dude.  A little money, right?  You've got to grease somebody, right?  Did you lose points when you didn't shower in school?  No.  I hear, though, that they did take grades off of some people.  Totally.  I'd lose points.  I didn't want to shower.  My dick was tiny.  So I'd lose points left and right. 
[00:19:00]  And then you do that thing where, like, you quickly, after gym, you run in and you just throw your head under the sink.  Wet your head, yeah.  The only guys that wanted to shower were the ones that had the big hogs.  Totally.  You're so right.  Or the gay guys.  If I was fucking hung huge, I would so be in the shower every day.  Soaping it up and, like, look.  With porno star shaved balls.  Absolutely.  Just, like, showing it off.  Making sure the water's nice and warm so it gets extra hunky.  Oh, now there's a girl in here.  I know.  We can't talk dirty anymore. 
[00:19:30]  What an attractive lady that's in here now.  Because when it comes down to it, we're really, like, nice guys and behave when there's a woman around.  Isn't that terrible?  We're not talking about the sluts that come in here.  We're talking about a lady that comes in.  No more of that wow stuff.  Yeah, we do that on Wednesday.  But now there's a lady in here, so we're going to feel weird discussing anything like that.  Just tell her it's WAF, dude.  It's Kelly from CBS News, and we've got an AP writer in here.  It's going to get a little crazy now, so.  Well, Kevin, you also have Clerks 2 you're working on? 
[00:20:00]  Working on Clerks 2 in January.  We start shooting.  Everyone coming back for that one?  Just the boys.  Just bringing back Dante, Randall, Jay, and Tom and Bob.  And it's a funny, funny flick.  I don't doubt it.  Absolutely.  You can doubt it.  I'll prove you wrong.  Okay, I'll doubt it a little bit and then prove me wrong.  Well, congrats, dude, on being back.  That's excellent.  All right, Kevin.  Thanks, man.  And we'll hopefully hook up with you through Big Kev in November.  Yeah, he brags about his little cameo.  Big Kev is my guy. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  We didn't believe him.  Big Kev are total comic book nerds.  Yeah.  Believe me, we know.  We didn't believe Kevin for the longest time, but I guess we have to start believing him.  I know.  We were thinking, sure, Kevin Smith knows you.  Sure you know him.  But hang out.  I had to show them the Jersey Girl trailer where you could see the top of my head.  Big Kev is a flat-out pimp in the world of comics.  Have you ever seen his sketchbook?  It's huge.  I know.  That's what matters in the world of comics.  It's not the size of your dick.  It's the size of your sketchbook.  He's my spawn action figure connection also. 
[00:21:00]  Yep.  Yeah.  Any action figure I need, he's there.  He hooks you up.  All right.  Total geek.  Do you want anything special when you come by?  Um, no, no.  Just don't make me shower, please.  No problem.  No worries.  All right, Kevin.  Thank you so much.  Thanks, Kevin.  Thanks, guys.  Awesome.  Kevin Smith, everyone.  And I think we've got to step aside, take a break, let them set up these lights.  Cameras and action.  Oh, no.  Is this where the shot's going to be?  Boom mics. 
[00:21:30]  Look at me.  I'm complaining.  It's behind, over my shoulder shot.  That's all right.  I'll turn around like this.  All right.  We'll figure it out.  Okay.  Steve, give us a break.  We'll be back.  Opie Anthony Dance Party Weekend.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Na, na, na.  Na, na, na.  The Opie Anthony Show.  Comedy gone too far.  Everything they tell you about pot is a lie.  They tell you pot smoking makes you unmotivated a lie. 
[00:22:00]  When you're high, you can do everything you normally do just as well.  You just realize it's not worth the fucking effort.  Sure, I could get up at dawn, get in traffic, go to a job I hate that does not inspire me  creatively whatsoever for the rest of my life.  I could do that.  Sure.  Or.  I could sleep till noon. 
[00:22:30]  Get up and learn how to play the sitar.  Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.  What is it, one string?  How fucking hard is this instrument?  Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.  I don't know.  There'd be a better world.  The world of sitar players calling the fucking aliens in the fifth dimension this morning. 
[00:23:00]  Here are some more men who ought to be strapped to a gurney and castrated with fishing knives.  White guys who shave their heads completely bald.  You know?  They're so ashamed they lost 11 hairs, they're going to try to turn it into some kind of a  masculine statement.  I say, hey, you goofy-looking, baldy-headed fuck. 
[00:23:30]  Looks good on black guys.  On you, it's ugly, repulsive, and disgusting.  You want to be bald?  Do what I did.  Wait a while.  Meantime, there's no excuse for running around looking like a freshly circumcised dick.  Here's Opie and Anthony when they aren't stinking.  Ooh, who took their shoes off?  It's a little stinky in here. 
[00:24:00]  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  We have to say hi to Dom Morena.  Dom Morena.  Dom Morena.  Or was it Dom Morena?  Hey, Dom.  It's Dar Ferrer.  Our stupid producer mispronounced your name, so we've been calling you Dom Morena all morning long.  I kind of like that.  It's almost Latino.  I'd have a lot bigger following.  Yeah.  Well, um...  So what did I miss?  Some 18-year-old girl admitted she slept with her father's friend?  Oh, my God, yeah.  Yeah, we weren't buying it at first, but now we're definitely buying it. 
[00:24:30]  Why can't I meet kids like this?  She decides that she needs to tell her mom, so we decide, why not tell her on the air?  Yeah.  And it got a little ugly.  Basically, she slept with her father's best friend, yes.  Oh.  Wow.  You raise a kid just so your friend can have sex with her.  I always love when people admit to stuff on the air, like a nice, intimate surrounding.  I know.  Well, I don't know.  Why do people do that?  Why do they do that?  Like on Oprah and stuff?  Why?  Jerry Springer and... 
[00:25:00]  Well, the Jerry Springer stuff.  That's bullshit, yeah.  Yeah, that's all fake.  But they do.  They come on the other shows and just admit things.  Why don't they just go into a nice room with their loved one and admit it there?  I don't blame the guy for liking a younger chick.  I like younger chicks.  So what?  Of course.  Lots of boys killed me about it.  You know, when people say to me, you know, why do you go out with a girl that young?  I go, because I can.  What am I going to go?  You know, I'm going to go out with my grandmother, somebody as old as me.  You know what I mean?  Come on, give it up, you old bag.  There's plenty of time when you get older to be with an older woman. 
[00:25:30]  Yep.  So when you're, you know, when you're middle-aged, I guess.  What did she look like, this girl?  We don't know.  She sounded hot.  We didn't really ask.  She seemed like a typical 19-year-old.  Oh, I love that.  That you would find in Hazleton, Pennsylvania, and the mother's raising another two so best  friends could have sex with them.  Dom, did you ever date a younger girl?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, always.  I mean, my girlfriend's 20 years younger than me.  Really?  Well, so was the one.  I broke up. 
[00:26:00]  I was married, and I was going out with, like, this 18-year-old girl.  As a matter of fact, her father was my best friend.  No, but I did for a while, and I cheated on my wife.  And I really, I mean, it was like a year.  That's not worth the energy.  Wait, you were married, and you cheated with a younger woman?  Yeah, for a year.  You cheated for a year?  How'd you pull that off?  I don't know.  I was just out of my fucking mind.  I was, like, going to Vegas with her.  I looked like one of those, like, Goombas with the big blonde with the big tits, you know. 
[00:26:30]  The chippy at your side?  Yeah, yeah.  Like the arm piece thing.  I mean, I'm still friends with her, but she got too old for me.  I asked you that question, because Dom is the author of one of my favorite jokes ever.  That was my awful setup, but it's like, I saw you on stage one time, and you're like,  I dated a girl who was so young, I didn't see her for a while, she got taller.  One of the greatest jokes ever written.  Her favorite food is pistetti. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, that's funny.  Really good.  Oh, wow.  That's in that child molestation shit.  But did you hear me almost butcher that brilliant joke?  I know.  You were teetering there for a while, Jim.  Damn it, I was nervous.  I was ruined his joke.  No, no.  Hey, man, did you guys get my setup so that you could ask me if I could knock them out  of the park?  We got nothing.  We didn't even have your name right. 
[00:27:30]  With my rental car bit and all that shit.  Now, we were talking about that.  I was talking to your producer last night.  He said, you know, what do you want to talk about?  I said, well, the one thing I don't want to do is fucking material in the sense of acting  like it's not material.  You know what I mean?  Oh, we love those setups.  Hey, you know, been on vacation?  No, because I know renting those cars is just a bitch.  It's funny you should ask.  Here's five brilliant minutes off the top of my head.  Yeah, because I'm the king of riffing. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, that's funny.  But I just want to do tell you the child molestation bit that Jim was referring to because it's  interesting how you can get away with shit if you pull it back on yourself.  But basically, it is child molestation is a horrible, hideous thing, but there's a flip  side to everything.  What about the kids like me who wanted to be molested and nobody would touch?  And my grandmother would be giving me a band and saying, well, I'm just tickling my balls  very lightly.  A couple of guests, let me see your tits, I'll give you a dollar.  But the thing about that is the only way you can get an audience on your side, you've got 
[00:28:30]  to bring it back.  You know what I mean?  You can't be like, you know, I like the fingy of your daughter.  Right, right, right.  Right.  Behind closed doors, perhaps that works.  Yes.  On the radio it works if you're a daughter telling mommy.  So how did the wife find out about the young chippy?  Her panties.  No.  Yeah, yeah.  She left her panties in one of the drawers.  I mean, it was a setup.  Yeah, she did it on purpose, right?  Yeah, yeah, sure.  She said she didn't.  Were you telling her, don't worry, I'm going to leave my wife? 
[00:29:00]  Oh, yeah.  And then a year goes by and she's like, fuck this, I'm going with the panties.  And your wife finds, like, underwear with Wonder Woman on them?  Right, right.  Underoos.  Underoos?  What the hell is this?  Yeah, that was horrible, though.  It's not worth it.  I mean, it's just worth it.  It's better, as you know, just to get a hooker.  Yeah, right.  It's not worth the energy of all that.  You know what kind of alibis you've got to come up with for a year and the things you've  got to keep track of?  Oh, man, I don't know how I did it.  I don't know how I covered it for myself.  Like, I just got caught with an internet thing with this girl from San Francisco. 
[00:29:30]  My girlfriend just caught me now.  I can't stop them.  That's my only fucking addiction.  I could give up drinking or anything else but this.  And she says, so I made up this whole story about it totally just, I was just trying to  practice using a computer and the internet and all that, and I got away with that.  How did you get caught?  She looked into, I'm so fucking stupid, I gave her my email.  Oh, Jesus.  I know. 
[00:30:00]  No, you know, I gave it to her because she had to look up a ticket of hers that I had  bought for her, and I totally forgot that they weren't all erased.  And she's paranoid enough.  Well, she's smart enough to go back and check it all out until I got caught.  You've got to watch even on Instant Messenger because there are programs that can track all  of the dialogue you've had on Instant Messenger.  So you've even got to watch what you say in those little IMs because they can check those  at computer.  All of a sudden there's a stack of printouts of things you said 12 months ago.  Yeah.  Oh, I am the worst at cheating. 
[00:30:30]  Always happens.  Everyone's running to their computers right now, thanks to Dom.  Dump it.  Dump your files.  Right.  I'm the worst cheater in the world because I don't care.  I don't even care.  Like, I will move on and not look back, so I don't even try to be subtle about it or  anything.  So I'm the easiest one to catch.  I just go, yeah, well, I'm cheating.  Goodbye.  Really?  Yeah.  I don't even try.  I leave things out.  It's awful. 
[00:31:00]  That's a good way to get out of a relationship.  It's pretty much it, you know, because why do I want to bother?  If you found somebody else, why do you want to bother hanging on to something you really  wish it was annoying you?  I don't know.  I must like the drama because you're right.  If you really care that much, you wouldn't even do it.  Yeah, people like playing Mannix.  You know, you like being the guy that's got to get the evidence, make sure it's set up  correctly.  You don't want the other party to catch on.  It's too much work.  There's something nice about sneaking around, though.  There's something hot about just knowing that it's dirty and wrong. 
[00:31:30]  Really?  Yeah, shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame on you.  Well, if you put it out, yeah, if you have everything on the surface, then it's not  nearly as much fun.  Yeah, but I mean, it is too much stress.  Too much, I can't, like, this whole fucking thing of it's hard enough traveling and resisting.  I mean, like, you can get chicks that, I could get girls right now, it's the fattest  I've ever been, the ugliest I've ever been.  I can get girls hotter than ever just because of my little bullshit comedy act.  Yeah.  Which is amazing. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, look at Jimmy Norton.  Look at Norton.  Dude, the last time I saw a rarer, I don't know what girl it was, if you were dating her,  if she was your wife or your girlfriend, but I've never seen you with any girl who wasn't  smoking hot.  It's fucking amazing.  Oh, the Montreal Comedy Festival, you were walking around with someone really hot.  Holy shit.  That's my girlfriend, that one.  Wow.  Yeah.  She's in bed now.  I don't know whether to go deep sea fishing or go back to bed and play with her ass and jerk  off.  I can't decide.  Help me out with this, guys.  We can flip a coin for you.  Does anyone have a coin?  You know, we have couples have sex on our show. 
[00:32:30]  Maybe this could be the first celebrity having sex on our show.  Now, whatever happened to Mercurio?  Who?  Who?  What?  Oh, nothing.  Never mind.  I had some kind of a thought.  I didn't know it.  What?  Who's he?  That's Jim's boy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You should hear what he says about him when the mics are off, that brave Jimmy Norton.  I just won't mention his name.  All right.  Where are you working, Dom?  I'm at Bananas in Poughkeepsie. 
[00:33:00]  Of course.  Friday and Saturday.  It's always funny.  No matter how much you try and be as good as you can at something, you have to say you're  working at Bananas.  Bananas.  I couldn't name it the Poughkeepsie.  Is there anything wrong with the Poughkeepsie Comedy Club?  Yeah.  It's not wacky and zany enough.  Yeah.  Already, Poughkeepsie's funny enough, but you've got to be Poughkeepsie Bananas.  People getting ready to go out are just sitting there going, wow, I'm going to Bananas tonight.  It's got to be fun.  The place is called Bananas. 
[00:33:30]  I mean, is there a funnier fruit than Bananas?  No.  It's bent.  It's yellow.  It feels wacky.  You can use it in a rainbow.  And then eat it.  There you go.  That's funny.  That is funny.  That's a great club, man.  Bananas, Poughkeepsie is phenomenal.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I love those clubs.  I mean, you know, to me, it's like so much.  I just like not having anybody tell me what to say or do.  That's why you guys must be having fun on satellite. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  It's a lot more fun than regular radio.  That's for sure.  You get tired of the bullshit of people editing you, and that's what I love about stand-up.  It's like, you know, just leave me alone, you know?  We're going to call it Bananas Radio, I think.  Yeah, I like that.  It makes it funnier.  I like the ring.  But the problem with Bananas is the symbol is actually a smiling banana.  It's a banana with a smiley face on it.  Unless they've got this cheap wooden chimp with paint chipping off it that's been around so long. 
[00:34:30]  That's behind you.  So no matter how far in life you go, you're still at Bananas.  You sure that's not the bouncer?  That's what I always think about, like certain comedy acts, you know, like, you know, Judy Tenuto.  Yeah.  Or like Harry Bazan, if you remember him.  But he was like a prop act.  And I said to Harry, you know, like, because he has to pick up his props after the show.  I said, no matter what I do, hopefully I walk away with a little dignity.  He said, you can have the greatest show of your life and you're still picking up your plastic ass and your Superman cape and your cow that goes over the moon, you know. 
[00:35:00]  That's pretty bad.  Hey, is he the guy that used to open for Rodney?  Yeah.  I have seen him.  Yeah, I did.  I was, I got a spot at Rodney's funeral.  It was like a gig.  We did the eulogy, right?  Yeah.  And, you know, it was a lot of fun as far as, like, you know, nostalgically looking back on this legendary guy. 
[00:35:30]  And he was really good to a bunch of us that were at the funeral.  And I loved the guy.  But Tim Allen, you ready for this?  He bumped.  He, like, asked for a spot like he was doing a gig at the improv.  Oh, man.  He wasn't even on the thing.  And, you know, it was just so weird.  I would never think of doing that.  I said that.  Adam Sandler says, are you going up?  He goes, no, man, I'll choke.  You guys do it.  It's like, you know, who wants to do a eulogy?  Here he is asking to do it.  Then he gets up and he says, we're not on the air now, right?  No. 
[00:36:00]  Okay.  He gets over and he goes, well, you know, Rodney taught me a big lesson.  He said he took me out of his special one time.  You know, he hired me and then fired me.  He says, you know, I realized Rodney was talking about his wife and doctors.  And I was talking about tools and cars.  And I guess you see where that got me.  It's like, what the fuck is this?  It's like, you know, your time for catharsis?  It's a funeral.  He's like, what if you're getting back at Rodney?  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  It's like bizarre.  It's kind of a weird place to be getting back at Rodney. 
[00:36:30]  Vindicated in front of his weeping fucking relatives?  What an ass.  Do another Christmas movie.  And then Leno gets up.  Leno gets up and he slams Bob Saget.  You know, because Leno can't have not one ounce of sincerity in his body.  And he goes, he says, yeah, Bob, it's good to see you're working again.  It's like fucking A.  It's like Saget was crying.  You know, people are crying.  The guy's dead.  It's a funeral.  He's doing like a roast.  Well, that is weird. 
[00:37:00]  That is very strange.  Wow, like a gig.  Did you go up and talk at all or no?  Yeah, I did, you know.  And I just said, I mean, I did a couple of stories about him because I loved the fact that he was so nuts, you know.  Like even when he was 80.  He was 80 years old.  He went to his birthday and he goes, hey, kid, you want to get fucked up?  And I go, Rodney, I don't smoke pot.  He goes, all right, I'll see you in 10 minutes then.  He was like this old kind of jazz musician.  We used to get him high on our show. 
[00:37:30]  He used to come in and we used to get him high all the time.  Oh, yeah, he was getting high.  Yeah, he was hot.  He was, like you said, in his 80s, he'd come to do our show and during the commercial breaks, he'd go get high with Stinky.  Yeah, he was doing coke in his 70s.  Jesus.  I told him he had a stroke.  I said, Rodney, man, be careful.  He goes, oh, it's just a mini stroke.  I ain't no pussy.  It's not going to ruin my day.  What, this one arm not working?  Fuck that.  He was the real deal.  Yeah, he was a character.  Very cool. 
[00:38:00]  Well, Dom.  I always like to end my bit with a sad moment.  Yeah.  Isn't that great?  A funeral story.  When are you working at Bananas?  Is this Friday, Saturday?  Yeah, this is Friday and Saturday.  And you're going to come in and see us soon?  I hope so, man.  Thanks.  Yeah, we'd love to have you in, all right?  I appreciate it.  All right, thank you, Dom.  Talk to you later.  Good luck with it, guys.  See you later, man.  Have good shows.  Very cool.  Very funny.  The funniest guy is alive.  Dom Turbo Carrera, as Ben would say.  Dom Marrera.  Always a tough name to say, actually.  The last name thing went nowhere? 
[00:38:30]  No.  It went down.  Because I was trying to remember the name he actually...  What did you say?  Dom what?  Dom Marina.  Dom Marina.  Dom Marina.  Dom Marina.  Ben Anthony, XM202.  Ben's busy trying to book guests for our show.  I love that.  I've read all the emails from corporate.  I've seen everything.  I just don't comment.  You know what I do with email?  I email the staff of this program only.  I don't email corporate. 
[00:39:00]  And it's just like, hey, did you see this story in the news?  Perhaps we should print it out for tomorrow.  I see emails that are CC'd with like 20 people.  And it's all of us from the show.  It's management.  It's sub-management.  It's all these corporate people.  And the last one I saw was a couple of days back, and it was about guests.  Right.  It was about booking guests, high-powered, Opie, high-caliber guests they want on this program.  Well, the people down there in Washington, yeah, they feel like we should have bigger guests on this show. 
[00:39:30]  Bigger guests will make the show more good.  The Rich Vosses and the Carlos Mencia.  No, no.  These guys are all really good friends of ours and do really good radio.  That's the point.  But I guess...  The Pablos.  We do know a collection of asses.  We certainly do.  But they do good radio.  But I guess it's all about having that big guest on the show.  And they'll sit there and say nothing.  But you can tell everyone, hey, we had George Clooney on the show.  Now, yeah... 
[00:40:00]  It's not there?  Okay.  Ben is now trying some of these contacts to see if we can get certain guests on the show.  Because it's Ben's ass on the line.  It's been hinted, look, if Ben doesn't get the bigger guests, you know, he's going to go bye-bye.  But let me tell you something.  It ain't Ben's fault.  I understand.  This program is not inviting to people of that caliber, of that type of Hollywood guest.  Does not really want to sit here and discuss punching women in the face promos to sell their god-awful Hollywood drivel movies. 
[00:40:30]  Right.  But Ben is trying.  Ben's trying to get Brad Pitt.  Yeah.  Ben's trying.  Like, you wouldn't believe.  He called me at lunch yesterday going, all right.  And he's laughing and giggling the whole time because he knows how stupid this is.  Of course he is.  But he's doing what he's told from the people in Washington.  So who are you trying to get on this show, Ben?  Dude, dude, I'm on the phone.  I'm on the other line right now with Johnny Depp's people.  I'm going to get Johnny Depp on the show.  That was the funny one. 
[00:41:00]  Johnny Depp and his people don't even know what XM satellite radio is.  Of course they don't.  Look, Ben's trying, man.  He's trying.  It's a fledgling industry.  We know that.  The people that are subscribed to XM, the people that work at XM, the people that are  involved in some way, shape, or form with satellite radio, they understand what it is.  They see the potential in it.  It's going to be huge.  It's going to take time, though.  But the reality of it is there are still a lot of people that have yet to find out what's 
[00:41:30]  going on with satellite radio.  They will, just like cable TV.  They will.  But where we are right now, it's very hard to call up George fucking Clooney and convince  him that it's advantageous for him to come on this program to sell his movie.  It's basically asking George Clooney if he wants to do an interview with a college radio  station.  Do you want to hang out with us?  Pretty much it is.  Hi, George.  Hey, George Clooney. 
[00:42:00]  Hi.  It's Opie, Anthony, and a few of our friends.  And we'd like to know if you want to come down and hang out with us.  Maybe have a beer or something.  You want to have a beer?  We'll hang out.  You're not that busy, right?  Oh, we'll be talking to a lot of people, relatively speaking.  If you would hang out with my neighbor down the street, there would be far less people  you'd be talking to.  But, yeah, you want to come out?  XM satellite radio.  What?  Satellite.  Yeah.  It's up there in space.  No, XM.  Yeah, like FM, only with an X in front and the F is gone. 
[00:42:30]  No, you don't have to put a space suit on.  No.  No, it's on Earth.  It's on Earth.  Right.  It's on Earth.  Yeah.  We just want you to come down and we can talk about Ocean's 12 that's coming out and  you know, all that.  Why?  No.  No, it's not CB.  It's XM satellite radio.  No, you won't have to key down the mic when you talk.  No, it's not accurate about that little bit you just did.  Why?  You would never have George Clooney on the phone. 
[00:43:00]  Right.  How did I get George Clooney on my fake phone?  You would have George Clooney's people's people.  I took it way out of my...  Oh, I was talking to George.  A little out of control there, you know, thinking you're that big that you would actually  get him on the phone.  I actually almost had him, I thought.  I thought he was coming in.  So, Ben, who are we working to get on the show in the near future?  Who are we working?  Watch Ben start giggling.  Oh, we better not say it.  Someone might block us.  No one's blocking us because we have four times the influence other people do.  Exactly.  All right.  Who are we working on, Ben? 
[00:43:30]  You really want to know some of the ones on the phone?  I bet we do.  Absolutely want to know.  These are actual phone calls that Ben has made just to try to save his job.  George Clooney.  Yeah, we know.  That's a possibility.  Brad Pitt.  Johnny Depp.  Yeah.  Easy.  Those were...  Yeah.  What did the...  Colin Farrell.  What did Johnny Depp's people really say?  Yeah, they just...  They didn't...  They were like, whatever.  Whatever.  That's great.  Well, we have a definite whatever of Johnny Depp's people.  I'm sure that's exactly what they say to Good Morning America, too.  Ah, whatever. 
[00:44:00]  Didn't you tell them about the little Wi-Fi Walkman?  Yeah.  That's a great invention, by the way.  Hey, I noticed.  Ben.  Yes.  You know, we're clearing out the cubicles and stuff.  You, too, can set up right in that room.  Well, you know, I was thinking that.  I think we should call up Bono and see if we can't get him down here.  All right.  But what the fuck is XM?  Will you have some fucking Guinness?  Be right there. 
[00:44:30]  So there's some...  There's actually some other ones.  We're working on them, huh?  There's actually some other ones I don't want to mention that look pretty good.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Secrets.  We might have a shot at someone that actually has name recognition.  Dude, we can't even get Louis Black anymore.  Yeah, Louis Black is even blowing us off.  Louis Black is blowing us off.  How are we going to get anybody?  If anyone holds Ben responsible for not getting guests for this show,  I will personally put them in a bucket and ship them out because it's not anyone's fault. 
[00:45:00]  It's just the...  People don't want to come on this show right now.  Not yet.  I mean, it's a...  It's a slow build, people.  It's a very slow build.  We understood what we were getting into, but we believe in this technology.  We believe this is the future radio, but it's going to take some time.  Our biggest interview so far has been John McEnroe.  That's not too bad.  Because we were going to be on his show that night.  Oh, yeah.  That's not bad.  We talked about Tatum O'Neal.  We also had Ozzy on.  Right, right.  On the phone.  I'm talking about coming in.  McEnroe didn't come in here.  Oh, that's right.  Louis Black will come on, though.  You guys have read the email. 
[00:45:30]  I read the email.  In spring, in the spring, when there's a book to promote, they said that he will be coming on.  We had Kevin Smith on the phone, too.  We found...  We're finding out who our...  Yeah, in the spring, Louis is...  You know something?  We're finding out who our real friends are.  You know, a lot of people blew us off after our demise.  I'm a little pissed off at Louis.  I never wanted to be pissed at Louis.  I like the man.  He's very funny.  And now we're getting the blow-off from Louis Black.  Yeah, he said...  Those Daily Show people are a bunch of assholes. 
[00:46:00]  I love the show, but they have gotten so, like, self-important.  Well, in the early days...  It's not essential.  Slow down.  In the early days of NAW, Jon Stewart was on the show all the time.  Yeah, we had Jon Stewart on the show.  Yeah, now he won't come on the show.  No way!  And it's harder now than it was at NAW.  That's all right.  All right, well...  So we're working on big guests for the...  Yeah, Mario Cantone lined up.  The new Opie and Anthony show.  Oh!  Now we got Britney, Eminem, and you two. 
[00:46:30]  We'll have them all playing out here on top of the show.  All at the same time.  It'll be great.  And then Steve can come in and punch Britney in the vagina.  Never say no, but there's a reality to this whole thing.  Yeah.  Yeah, famous people want nothing to do with us.  Right.  Stop hiding us on the premium tier, and then maybe we can get even bigger guests.  We're not like Hollywood Howie, where you can have these guests on.  And to tell you the truth, I don't necessarily want them on.  Yeah, we never really wanted the high-profile guests on our show.  This show isn't about getting...  What are we...  It's about... 
[00:47:00]  Are you going to sit Johnny Depp down there, too cool for the room, and start talking to  him?  I'd like to.  Just smell his finger.  Get a picture?  For a while, but...  Get a picture, of course.  It's about the funny on this show.  Yeah.  A lot of people feel like you're not doing a really good radio show unless you have  that A-list celebrity sitting there saying nothing.  You know what it's like?  And the bigger the celebrity, you know, a little inside to this whole thing, like we  had Carmen Electra on a few times.  We had a whole bitch.  We had a bunch of almost A-list celebrities, we'll call them, but Carmen Electra, when she  was on our show, she was definitely happening, okay? 
[00:47:30]  This is what happens.  They sit down, and then a whole entourage of people come in.  Their publicist...  The publicist, which is the scum of the earth, the publicist, will sit there and look  at you like you're a piece of shit and question everything you're asking their client with  those faces.  They make the face, and they'll shake their head like, no, no, and they're constantly  looking at their watch and doing the cut-off sign with their finger on the neck, the wrap-it-up  thing, the pointing at their watch. 
[00:48:00]  You want to lean over and smack them, and you ask them a question that's a little off-kilter,  something that they're not asked every friggin' time they do an interview, and the publicist  looks at you, shakes their head no, and puts that scowl on their face.  No, even worse.  Do you want to reach over and choke the bitch?  No, even worse, they'll pull their client out of the studio, or they'll cover up the  microphone, or they'll say stuff like, don't answer that.  Yeah.  Crocodile Hunters, remember his publicist hung up on the call because she didn't like  the questions?  Oh, that's right.  Remember that?  Yeah.  And the publicist, when you do the phone call interviews, they listen on another line. 
[00:48:30]  Of course.  They got the hookup, and if they decide it's going to a place that they don't like, yeah,  they'll just hang up on the interview.  Yeah, and it's no fun to be involved with that.  I don't like those guests.  We don't really care.  I mean, if it happens, it happens.  But, yeah.  I mean, they can't be obsessed with us talking to the really, really famous people on our  show.  People want to come in and hang out.  It's usually very boring radio.  Yeah.  If they want to come in and hang out and be part of the show, that's fine.  But to sit there and try to do an interview and ask them the same questions they've been 
[00:49:00]  asked a thousand times, it sucks.  Well, I think that we could ask some original questions.  Like, I'd love to get Ozzy in studio, because I want to ask him, like, what made you want  to get into music?  Yeah, that's a good question.  I'm sure he's never been asked before.  Like, what are you going to ask?  All right.  Well, we do have a few guests calling in today.  Who do we have today, Ben?  We have some 9-11.  Who do we got?  The L-List.  I'm sure it's huge.  Here we go.  Got that call from Johnny Depp back, did you?  Here we go.  Johnny Depp's in at 9 o'clock. 
[00:49:30]  Britney's performing live at 8.  On that definite whatever.  Bono and the Edge are going to come by and have some Guinness with us.  Nice.  There it is.  Psyched.  We're going to have the guest rundown every day with Ben.  All right, Ben.  Who do we have today on the show?  We have Jonathan Gold, who wants to talk about, he has some theories on 9-11.  Okay.  It's going to be very interesting.  Ah.  And Dom Morena.  Is that how you say something?  Dom Morena.  We don't know.  Dom Morena.  I'm sorry.  Guests so good, we don't even know their names.  What did I say? 
[00:50:00]  Dom Morena.  What did I say?  Dom Morena, you said.  Dom Morena.  Who the hell is he?  I think that was the guy that Vito Corleone stabbed.  Rich Vass.  Antonio Angelini.  Dom Morena.  Sorry.  All right.  I can't wait to talk to Dom Morena.  Wasn't that a dance a few years ago?  Hey, Dom Morena.  He was the quarterback for the Miami Dolphins.  Do you remember him?  Yeah.  Dom Morena?  Maybe that's why he can't get guests.  He's asking for Johnny Dupe.  Who?  I want Frank Clooney, and I want him now. 
[00:50:30]  I can get Rich Vass.  That's as good as I can get.  Dude, I want Pete Osborne in this studio.  Well, this is going to be hell.  I love that George Clowney.  Sure.  He's good.  I didn't know what Ben was doing yesterday.  Ben's like, look, I just want to black sky this.  Sorry.  This show is so stupid.  Dom Morena.  Dom Morena.  Hey, Dom Morena.  Jesus.  I'm going to call him Dom Morena now. 
[00:51:00]  Dom Morena.  He's a very funny comic.  Yeah, he is.  Dom Morena.  Yeah.  Drunk girls walking into traffic.  He's funny.  Wandered into traffic and bounced off the hood of a fucking bus.  I can see my house from here.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Say, Jim.  Nice meal.  The worst of O.B. and Anthony.  Is this some sexual reference?  Accept 202.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Word up.  Word up. 
[00:51:30]  Every night is strange.  When you're with a call, you've got to get it underway.  Word up.  Me too.  If I couldn't fill your wine for a question,  no matter what you're saying,  you know that you'll be learned.  Damn good smoothie.  Oh, can't test it.  Damn good smoothie.  Banana orange?  Mm-hmm.  What did you get, Opie?  What?  Did you get a smoothie?  Just a banana. 
[00:52:00]  Well, when I send them back for another one,  I'll be glad to treat you to a smoothie.  They're really good.  All right.  The O.A. virus spreading across America  thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  Can I ask a question?  Yes.  This has been bugging me for two weeks.  Every time I go into the bathroom,  the goddamn window is open.  Who is opening the window?  You know, it is freezing.  It's 35 degrees out.  How bad are somebody's log fumes?  Leave the fucking window closed.  You know, you're right.  That bathroom is freezing cold  because the window's open.  Some germaphobe is like,  oh, I've got to open the window 
[00:52:30]  to get the dirty germs out.  Why?  You want to bath them all hot.  Yeah, it's steamy.  You know, you want to smell it,  the fella next to your head for lunch.  Nothing better than leaning your head  into the store going,  hey, pastrami?  And he laughs  and he gives you the old knuckle to the chin.  But I went in there  and I closed it earlier this morning.  So somebody went in and opened it.  I would like somebody to fess up.  Reopened it.  Ben?  No?  He doesn't know?  I thought he was coming in with an answer.  Nice.  You know, who's opening that bathroom window? 
[00:53:00]  It might be Ben  because that gust of wind  maybe hits him  when he opens the window.  No, he actually opened it  because it smells like shit in there.  No, it doesn't.  You're the one that opens it every day?  I'm not the only one that does it.  Oh, so Ben is...  Exactly.  Who else does it?  It's 30 degrees out.  I'm trying to shit.  It's not 30 degrees out.  My bag is gripping me  like a little hornet's nest.  Good.  First of all, you...  You destroy that place.  So when you go in there...  You're really teaching that bathroom a lesson.  Well, you're not supposed to go in there  and eat egg salad. 
[00:53:30]  You walk in,  you take your dump of your leak  and you leave.  It's not supposed to smell good in there.  It's a men's room.  I miss Richard Dreyfuss with AIDS.  Yeah, we do miss him.  That guy that used to clean the bathroom  in any W.  That guy would put a...  He would have welded that window shut  so no one could open it.  You know what used to suck about that guy?  He would always be there  when you had to take the dump.  We used to get these limited times  where we could actually squeeze out a dump.  Limited times?  You were playing 18 minutes of commercials  an hour.  Yeah, but there was always something  going on where it was hard to 
[00:54:00]  run all the way down the hall  to get to that bathroom  and take the dump.  And you didn't know  if Norton was banging  some chick over the toilet  which he'd been known to do exactly.  How many times  did you bang chicks in that bathroom?  Not many.  One or twice.  The answer should be like never  because it's a work environment  but Norton's answer is not many.  Now one time I whacked my bag  with some chick in the stinky stairwell.  A couple times I hooked up in there  and I got blown in there once.  That was a great, great...  M.E.W. was fantastic.  Yeah.  Lots of nooks and crannies.  Places to leave loads all over. 
[00:54:30]  Now the thing is,  there's nowhere.  It's all well lit.  But the bathroom there  that we used to use for dumps  wasn't just an N.E.W. bathroom.  It was for that floor.  So other people from other offices  would go into that bathroom.  We kind of had like a private bathroom  whoo whoo whoo  outside the studio  but we made it the...  We made it no crunch zone.  The crunch free zone.  Because it stunk the entire green room up.  Green room up.  Right.  You could take a dump in there  and then the door would open up  and it would stink the entire floor up.  So we said no crunching. 
[00:55:00]  That's for urination only.  And then the other bathroom,  you'd run down there  and there was Richard Dreyfuss with AIDS  cleaning up  with his big yellow gloves on.  The door propped open with his cart  and you're like,  it just wrecked.  I can't now take a dump.  I'd be making some noise.  Oh man,  when one of those logs got stuck,  he would just put that yellow glove on  and go to town  and make sure it went down that bowl.  He'd choke it.  He would choke it  and break it apart  so it went down  with his bare hand.  If you had trouble taking a dump,  he'd actually pick you up  and bear hug you from the front 
[00:55:30]  and help squeeze it out  like your toothpaste,  that faggot.  I remember one time  I was on a bowl  and I'm dropping what was awful,  some type of miscarriage  in the toilet  and I see his foot  come under my stall  and pull a piece of paper out  that was sticking half.  Oh, bitch.  Ugh.  That guy has the worst job  and he loved his job.  He really did.  He took his job very seriously.  I don't know what his name was  but I hope he died  in the two years  that we were off.  Tragically.  We kind of liked that guy.  I hope he was at his kid's wedding  and he had a stroke  while cleaning a bathroom.  We liked that guy. 
[00:56:00]  We didn't like him.  I didn't like him.  He didn't do anything to you.  I didn't like him.  He ruined about 40 dumps.  He should die in a tuxedo  scooping a toilet out.  Dude, the guy was making  $15,000 a year  to squish logs  so they could go down a bowl  and you wish...  I bet you he wasn't making anything.  He probably showed up  voluntarily to do it.  And you wished death on the guy?  Yeah.  He did ruin a lot of dumps.  Ugh.  All I ask is  I'm alone in the bathroom.  Do you know when you're walking...  No, you don't ask for being alone  in the bathroom.  As soon as one of us  wants to go to the bathroom  you follow right behind us.  To take a whiz is fine  but I gotta take a dump.  Right.  I want nothing. 
[00:56:30]  There were times  where I'd be walking down the hallway  with the...  When you got the pain  where the back of your thighs hurt  like...  And there's only one thing  gonna fix it.  You know?  Getting in there  and releasing.  Yep.  And your body knows  that you're approaching  the bathroom  and starts winding up  and you're around that corner  and there's Richard Dreyfuss  with AIDS  with his cart  and his gloves  and he...  And you're just...  God!  I'm already in the mode!  I've started the... 
[00:57:00]  The whole...  The wheels are in motion!  That gas pain  where you're unbuttoning your belt  undoing your belt  and you're afraid  that if you sit  you're gonna shit  on the way down?  You ever have to...  I've actually had to stand  over the toilet  and not bend  until that one gas pain  because if I try to bend  I'm gonna shit  down the back of my leg.  It's all over.  Those are the best.  And you hold it  until you get the chapter  you want  and then you just start  reading release!  Why is it  you have to get to a page  and start reading?  I don't know.  I'm summing right through  this particular chess problem.  God damn ads! 
[00:57:30]  I like to read chess books  on the toilet  and then I'll actually hold it  until I get to the right  Kasparov game.  I'm a weirdo, yeah.  I have a pile  of popular mechanics.  I read popular mechanics.  Hey, what's new?  I'm not in.  Let's see what's coming out.  Hey, look at what was out  a hundred years ago today.  I'm not in long enough  to read anything.  I'm not in there  long enough to read anything.  I'm not.  I'm trying to figure out  a way to get a magnetic  chess board  so I can bring it  in the bathroom  so I can work out  chess moves on the toilet.  Chess moves.  I swear to God  that's all I want to do. 
[00:58:00]  Play chess on the toilet.  How are you not in there  long enough to read?  Yeah, what are you  just poop and leave?  Yeah, just real quick.  There are times  that you'll just be relaxing.  Listen, you're kind of  you're done with your business  but I'm not done reading.  No.  And then you get  the big butthickey ring  and you wind up  walking out  you look like a newborn fawn  on your asleep legs.  I'm back to being regular.  Yeah, but you could be regular  and still hang out  for a quick read.  Four, three quick dumps  within 15 minutes  done for the day. 
[00:58:30]  Do you really?  Yep, done for the day.  Jesus, back to normal.  Cancer patient bowels  three dumps  as soon as you get up?  Three dumps.  One after another.  Get out of that head!  It's the weirdest thing.  I want that head so clean  that Opie himself  will be proud  to dig a dump in it  three times  before he goes to work.  I once had one stuck.  So you know  all this oatmeal and crap?  Right.  I was on the train  and I was in there  for a long time  and it was still attached  and I know  and you know  the bowls  and the trains  and stuff  that there's a lot of room 
[00:59:00]  before it hits water?  Yeah.  So it's just kind of  hanging there.  Oh, God!  A bungee log.  But the best part  I knew there was  a lot more in me  attached to this  particular log  and I'm sitting there  and I'm waiting  and I'm waiting  and I'm like  what the F I'm going to do?  So I start doing  the dump exercises  like I stand up  and I start like  jumping  just trying to release  the thing  from my body  I swear to God  I really thought  I would have to  go in there  with whatever  it probably would have  had to be my fingers  or something  I don't know  It turns sideways 
[00:59:30]  halfway out sometimes  and it just jams  and it's awful  Turn sideways  When you go to wipe it  if you have to like  finish it  if you're like  this is not going to happen  you go through  50 pieces of paper  and it's still a problem  No, no, no, no  No, no, no  I have to stay in there  until it's all out  Do you?  That's why you got to  hang out for a while  But I was like  pushing my stomach  I was jumping up  and down a little bit  and this damn thing  was still attached  I can't stand how gross  these conversations get  but I guess everyone  goes through it  Yeah  Now when you're  not done  and you know 
[01:00:00]  like the final  chapter hasn't happened  the final drop  hasn't been done  It's hanging  and I know I got  at least another  four to five inches  What about the surprise though?  You think it came off  You're sitting there reading  and after a while  it's like  You feel that  and then  I didn't even know  that was there  Or you stand up  and it's gotten  a little cooler  because your body  temperature isn't with it  and you feel it  brush against the back  of your cheek  and you're like  Oh, come on  You know what I'm talking  about?  There's a little piece  that still starts  Do you wipe? 
[01:00:30]  No, no  When you stand up  I stand up to wipe  I don't sit and wipe  I'm not a girl  I stand up  I put one foot  on the bowl  and one foot  Wait, no, no, no, no  Always  I never sit  Don't look at me  like I'm weird  when everyone's laughing  at you  I stand up  Why do we have to have  the demonstration?  I just feel like I'm talking  That's really how you wipe  You stand up  and put one foot  on the bowl seat  and the other foot  on the floor  and I actually lean forward  and arch my ass out  It is very bizarre 
[01:01:00]  and I wipe  this way I can get in there  I want it clean  Oh, man  Do you guys sit  on a toilet and wipe?  Oh, my God  You don't sit  It's a bend over thing  so you're almost  your head is like  between your knees  but you're still sitting  Never  And then you reach back  and you take care of business  No  There's no standing  Dude, it was embarrassing  That defeats the purpose  You're messing stuff up  by standing up  When I was in Iraq  one of the problems  we had  we had to use these bathrooms 
[01:01:30]  the soldiers used  and they're like  these little portable  tents that have these  like, you know  tent stalls  next to each other  and when you sit  your feet go straight out  and there's a leather curtain  so I would  I think they just don't want you  on the toilet all day  so they make it  slightly uncomfortable  So I would do that  to wipe my ass  but my head would  poke out of the curtain  so people walking  into the bathroom  would just see me  half leaning out of the curtain  It was the only way  I could wipe my crack  Oh, these are so sick  Yes, Ben?  I got a great one  My old apartment  when I first moved to New York 
[01:02:00]  I had this little apartment  I was dating this girl  and I'd come home  and I'd taken a dump  and it didn't  it got all clogged up  and I didn't have a plunger  so imagine what it was like  I had to go down  to the doorman  downstairs  and come back up  That was one of the  that was a pretty bad one  Nothing worse  Nothing worse than the  overflowing toilet  at someone else's house  You ever have  a log overflow  over the top of the pole?  When I see  I learned this  at a very young age  when I see the water  coming up in the toilet  you get that panic 
[01:02:30]  You panic  but right away  I lunge  under the toilet  and it's a race  against time  Will the water  reach the top  and overflow  or will I shut  that valve off  quick enough?  Where under the toilet  is that?  Under every toilet  on the side  or under the toilet  Yeah, it has that little knob  It's a little tin valve  Right  That you must turn quickly  Oh, I didn't know that  And it shuts off  and right when the water  reaches the top  Oh, but then  you've got to get rid of it  Plunger  What if there's no plunger?  Fish net  I have learned  to use  A little guppy fish net 
[01:03:00]  Anything  Anything in the garbage pail  Sometimes  I've used shampoo bottles  at people's houses  where if the water  goes down low enough  you wait long enough  it'll slowly go down  but it won't be unplugged  You take a shampoo bottle  shove it in there  and then pull it out  real quick  It'll do it  Rolled up newspaper  If people read a lot  or a magazine  You roll it up  Roll it up  Shove it down the hole  Cool  And then give it  a few pumps  And then you'll hear that 
[01:03:30]  Ah, the crap's down  I'm off the hook  Because you don't want to  You know  You don't want logs  in your little bath mats  Little pieces of fetid dump  You'll never get that stuff out  I'm telling you  Yeah, you know  Bill brings up  a good point here  Bill from Colorado  Go ahead  Hey man  I was listening to Jimmy  talk about the position  he's in when your wife's his ass  When I was a kid once  I think  I walked in on my sister  I think that's the same  position girls get in  when they put a tampon in  You know that  It's on the box 
[01:04:00]  That's the instruction  on the box  It shows a girl  how to stand  That it's one foot  on the toilet  One foot on the floor  And then the insertion  For me it's just  to get my crack  nice and clean  That's why I do it  I don't have a very hairy crack  but I like it clean  I'm a weirdo  but I like hygiene  Oh, you can like it clean  but you don't have to  use that position  Dude, I dig my finger  way in  I get every piece of paper  I do  It's not gross  I'm clean  Rick, what's going on?  You guys can eat my ass  right now  It's fantastic  You don't actually penetrate  Oh yeah, always  Do you use the little wipes  that they have out now? 
[01:04:30]  I actually bought them recently  and what I'll do  Aren't they a treat?  Not every time  but I usually shower after  If I'm going out  I'll shower  But I'll take  I'll put a paper  I'll wipe it  I'll use the wipes  and get it  I put the finger  wrap the finger in the wipe  and then push it up  pull it out  I want the whole channel clean  Dude  I don't just want the outside  You guys want the outside  That's why you get skid marks  I never get skid marks  Ever  I don't get skid marks  You guys have told  years ago  Well, that's because  I had the flu  Years ago  It looked like a used shoe shine rag  because I had the flu  I have the flu sometimes  As long as you have 
[01:05:00]  a nice airtight seal  there's no need to clear  beyond the doorway  Nor to clean it up  You know  Sorry, guys  You don't have to penetrate  the seal  Always  If a chick's giving you  a Hummer  and she licks your bag  it's going to reek  You ever go down  on a girl  and smell that?  I've had that happen  where you're going down  on her  and she parks her legs  and that smell of  old capicol  comes up  and you're like  Let's go to Kurt in Jersey  What's up, Kurt?  Okay, okay 
[01:05:30]  I give up  Go back to gay  We're doing pretty well  getting the gay out  so far  That's funny  We had that hot chick  from Oregon  this morning  She was alright  Actually, Rick is calling  from Oregon as well  Rick, what's up?  Alright, enough of this stuff  It's like I'm driving  a big truck down the road  There's nowhere to pull  off the road  and now I've got to get down  Now you've got to go  Alright  That little gurgling  Is there anything worse  than that gurgling  when you can't do anything  about it? 
[01:06:00]  We call it the percolating  You're percolating  I had one  before I got on a flight  to Atlanta  a few months ago  I don't know what was wrong  I wasn't sick  but I must have taken  eight shits  in the airport  That's the worst place  to take a dump  Everybody's got their laptops  Hold on  We've got to go  to the phones real fast  before we lose John  Go ahead, John  Hey, how you guys doing?  Hey  You're going to bring up  something that we talk  about all the time  of the show  but go ahead  Well  The way Jimmy wipes  he likes to keep himself 
[01:06:30]  nice and clean  by wiping that way  Yes  The next guy  who uses a toilet  has to sit down  where he just put his foot  The foot that walked  across the bathroom floor  through all the pee drip  and all the pee tears  and grit  Yeah, you raise a good point  but most of my dumps  80% of them  are done at home  or in hotels  but even so  I'm Willie Wipe  when it comes to the seat  so you've got to  wipe the seat off  That's the next guy's  responsibility  Yeah, okay  I thought he was going to  talk about something else  Everybody will think about 
[01:07:00]  that the next time they go  You keep yourself  perfectly clean  but then you have  no problem diving  into some whore's ass  I didn't say  there are no inconsistencies  Yes, there are inconsistencies  Whenever I wipe my chest  I put my foot up  Alright, thank you John  Thanks, bye  Al the Cop  Al the Cop  from East Northport  has a little story  At some chick's party  back in high school  my bud had a crap  that wouldn't fit down  the bowl  because of its length  So we took a comb  out of the comb  and brush holder  on the girl's sink  sawed the lock  in half 
[01:07:30]  rinsed the comb  and put it back  Oh, that's great  Very nice  Despicable  Someone's wondering  why they have a peanut  in their hair  That's good  Welcome to the  Opie and Anthony  Ooh, it's in my shoes  Ramone, clean this up  Here's Opie and Anthony  when they aren't stinking  Ooh, who took their shoes off  It's a little stinky in here  The worst of Opie and Anthony

[01:25:00]  first teacher  that decided  she hadn't  prepped for  class  and came up  with that  brilliant idea  That's what  that was all  about  Look I can't  bother writing  any tests  or lessons  Just bring  something from  home and  talk about it  Look I know  I got a hot  day tonight  and I'm  going to be  really hung  over and  I'm going  to do some  blow and  have two  hours of  sleep  It's show  and tell  tomorrow  kids  That's what  they want  to say  Just bring  something from  home and  talk about it  I can't  be bothered  It'll take  up half  the day  Little bastards  Talk about  grandfather's  little freaking 
[01:25:30]  dat  You know  when I was  a kid  and I believe  it was  first grade  or second  grade  or something  the teacher  did a project  where we all  planted vegetables  in the little  milk cartons  Remember that?  Watch them grow  and they would  die before they  reached maturity  because they're  in little milk  cartons  Well my uncle  had a garden  and I took  it out of the  milk carton  and transplanted  it into the  garden  and when it  was done  I brought  one of the  vegetables  into my  teacher  To show her  like wow 
[01:26:00]  this is the  vegetable plant  and you know  what it was  the plant  it was a  cucumber plant  so I just  come into  class with  this huge  and I picked  the biggest  one  it was this  big giant  cucumber  and I gave  it to her  and I remember  her laughing  when I handed  it to her  and I just  thought she  was pleased  that I brought  her the  cucumber  and you think  back now  of course  it's like  oh here's  a little kid  bringing her  this huge  phallic  dildo  that's not  the best  uncle's story  though  oh well  my uncle  was very  into gardening  in the 70s  my uncle  Joe  just tell that  story really  fast  because that's 
[01:26:30]  an amazing  well it was  a short time  after my  parents split  up  so it was  just my  mother living  I was living  with my mother  and my brother  and my sister  you know  my father  booked out  to California  and my mother  took in my  uncle  at that time  as to be  I guess  the man of  the house  or something  rent out the  room  make a little  extra money  you needed  a father  figure  rent out the  downstairs  yeah like  my uncle  Joe is going  to be the  father figure  god damn  hippie  he's a  god damn  hippie 
[01:27:00]  and he was  into gardening  so he planted  what he told  my mother  was a  basil  oregano  hybrid  planted in  the backyard  just in case  you need  about  25 to  30 huge  plants worth  of basil  oregano  hybrid  and my  mother  was fine  with this  so my  father  comes to  visit us  little  weekend  visit  one weekend  visit  yeah  did he  go and play  catch at the  schoolyard  no  with my  father  the divorce 
[01:27:30]  visits  were all  about  taking me  to the  local  bar  sitting me  down  him drinking  watching the  ball game  or something  and me  you know  drinking a  shirley temple  or a coke  and thrilled  that I could  open up  peanuts and throw  the shells  on the floor  and playing  defender in the  corner  no it was  before video  games  yeah I know  it was like  1972  something like  that  dude people  think we're  in our  20s  yeah right  okay  weren't you  playing your  playstation 2  in the  I was playing  Glaxon  I was playing  Halo

[01:28:30]  the paddle  bigger so we  can pretend  we're playing  tennis  put a goal  in it  and it's  hockey  now I'm  playing squash  it's a wall  in the middle  flip the switch  big switches  oh god  those games  were awful  it was all  we had  though  alright  so where  were we  so my  uncle  planted  these  plants  and they  grew  obviously  they were  pot plants  and they  were 10  feet tall  planted in  these huge  garbage pails  in the  backyard  and they  took up  our entire 
[01:29:00]  patio area  and my  father comes  to pick  us up  and just  lays into  my mother  and says  what are you  doing  do you  understand  if the  police  see pot  plants  growing in  the yard  they could  take the  kids away  from you  you will  go to  jail  and my  mother just  looks at  him  puts on  the face  like  excuse me  it's a  basil oregano  hybrid  which my  father was  just like  yeah fine  I'll go back  out to  California  and not  deal with  you  but he 
[01:29:30]  was growing  huge plants  he cut  them down  with this  big machete  and hung  them in  his apartment  the whole  house  smelled  like pot  smelled  like pot  for years  probably  still  does  and that  was my  uncle's  contribution  to us  growing up  and probably  started my  brother on  his long  road to  smoking  weed  another one  my brother  tried it  once in  in Huntington  hence the  timing when  he comes in  to do our  show  yeah  hence Joe's  impeccable  comic timing 
[01:30:00]  on the  microphone  could be  pot  induced  he knows  I'm kidding  I love  him  you know  that  the neighbors  were growing  pot across  the street  from our  house  yeah  in Huntington  once  there was a  little wooded  area  and I had  just found  out in school  I had learned  about pot  and you know  when the guy  comes in  and the cop  and he shows  you the  drawings and  all the stats  about pot  and everything  and I was in  the woods  across the street  and I found  pot plants  growing  and it was 
[01:30:30]  my brother  and my brother  and his friend  Lloyd  that lived  next door  growing these  pot plants  hello  Lloyd  and I took  him and pulled  him out of the  ground  and I run  and I go  mom look  I found  marijuana  she goes  oh wow  okay well  just take it  out back  and you know  step on it  or whatever  you want to  do  destroy it  destroy it  so I took  it out back  on the patio  and I'm  just crushing  it into the  into the ground  into the cement  and I look up  at the big  living room 
[01:31:00]  bow window  looking over  our backyard  and there's  Joe  standing there  looking at me  with I swear  a tear in his  eye  as he's watching  me crush  the pot plant  and then later  on I see him  outside where I  was squishing it  on his knees  picking up these  little tattered  remnants of pot  leaves  it looked like  Richard Pryor  looking for the  crack  and the coke  and the carpet  looking for the  crack  yeah  and he went  inside and dried  it in the oven  and tried to 
[01:31:30]  smoke it  nice  I was a little  dick when I was  a kid man  just a buzz kill  alright you guys  ready for show  and tell  show and tell  brought this thing  in today for you  guys  what have you  brought for the  class  gotta take it  out of the bag  want it to be a  surprise everybody  oh no  okay now I'm  on to it  no you're not  I could tell  from Ben's  reaction  Ben hasn't  seen anything  yet  I figured out  what it was  I didn't see  it but I can  figure out  what it is  oh no  oh

[01:34:00]  jar has to  be returned  to its  rightful owner  at the time  I thought it  would be a  cool  conversation  starter  I can't  look at that  thing  it needs a  tan  I was severely  wrong  don't shake  it because I  think the top  leaks  and I gotta  give it back  to it  which is  Andrew Gore  no bit  no jokes  I don't want  this thing  anymore  but you can't  just get rid  of it  I have to  hand it  back to him  I don't know  how you wanted  it in the  first place

[01:39:00]  a drudge report  and uh  fox news's page  and things like that  just to keep updated  on current events  and things that are happening  and um  for some reason  it disappears  on a daily basis  things disappear  around here  that's what I've noticed  in uh  the week that we've uh  we've been coming here  some things disappear  well there's uh  a new list of problems today  not so much the equipment  which is nice  everything's being sorted out  well this is our channel  High Voltage 202  right  and we start every day 
[01:39:30]  at 5 a.m.  I don't know when you're  listening to this show  a lot of people hear it live  other people hear it uh  in the afternoon  I have no idea  but 5 a.m.  eastern time  we start playing some  kick-ass rock and roll  to get you psyched for the show  have some fun  and uh  Ben helps out  and programs the damn thing  for us  to get everyone psyched  and uh  he programmed  a nice hour of music  for today's show  and it disappeared  it was really good too  I really put it  I had a lot of songs  Stones who  why would the music  just disappear  so then we had to 
[01:40:00]  play the music  from yesterday  which was a  a kick-ass set  but you know  but we want to  change it up a little bit  yeah we definitely  want some variety  on this channel  and that just  disappeared off  of the computer  as did you  you saw my new  lighter that I had  yesterday  I got this  brand new lighter  that's gone  all different  the radio out there  that I was listening  to  that dickhead  out there  you know  yelled at me  for yesterday  yeah  that's gone  that's gone  does anyone else  can't even listen  to the show  out there  oh  well  that  that kind of  seems obvious  who would have  taken that  well that 
[01:40:30]  that'll all  change  does anyone else  use this  studio  no  no I think  we're gonna get  a lock  we do have to  get a lock  because all the  buttons are  switched around  every day  yeah they're  shitting the  board  shouldn't change  look it's  it's hard enough  for Anthony and I  to build this  brand new show  we got our work  cut out for us  but to come in  here and then  you know  we're trying to  figure out all  the new equipment  and then have  all the buttons  reset and changed  and this and that  every morning  and the computer  favorites all gone  someone is messing  with us  passwords are  different 
[01:41:00]  I log on  because now  I'm assuming  my favorites  aren't up here  because it's  logged in  under someone  else's password  like each time  you log in  it's like a  brand new  computer  Opie  if there's  someone in  the building  on this  floor  that has  a problem  with us  then come  in the studio  and face us  I don't think  that's going to  happen  if you have a 
[01:41:30]  problem with us  come in now  and we'll settle  it  waddle in here  stop being a  pussy and doing  things behind our  back  now you're  making accusations  Opie  I did not  I asked if  there was  someone that  had a problem  you're implying  that he's doing  things behind  our back  somebody is  things are  disappearing  yeah  what does Ben  need a lighter  for  you smoke  no  I got this 
[01:42:00]  brand new  I showed  it to Opie  I only got a  $50 lighter  I like smoking  cigars  I got it  the other night  I left it  right here  and it was  gone  are there still  places to smoke  in the city  there's a few  really  yeah  there's  well there's  one that's  breaking the law  right by the  office here  but there's  actually like  10 legal  places  I'm kind of  you know  when Mayor  Bloomberg here  in New York  City  first came out  with this  smoking ban  I was like  no man  fight the  power man  you know  people want  to smoke  they should 
[01:42:30]  be allowed  to  freedom  man  now  I don't  want anyone  smoking anywhere  I'm horrible  I'm one of  those people  I know  I know  but I'm one  of those people  now where  it's like  it's kind  of nice  to go out  and come  home  and not  have the  whole house  smell like  your sweater  because it's  covered in  smoke  well this is  what I don't  understand  I don't  understand this  if you own  a bar  okay  why aren't  you allowed  to let people  smoke in your  bar  because  it's a legal  substance  because the  people that  work there 
[01:43:00]  that's what  Bloomberg was  saying  is the  people that  work there  shouldn't be  subject  they don't work  in that bar  yeah but  you know  that might be  the job  they can get  I'm not a  smoker  and I'm  like you  I'm glad  that there's  no smoking  anymore  because you  can wear  clothes like  more than  once  things like  that  you can  breathe  you know  yeah  but I don't  I don't  get that  you know  it's a legal  substance  that they're  telling people  you're not  allowed to  have people  smoking in  your establishment  I don't get  that  this is America  they're saying  it's a health  threat  well then when  you're getting  your workers  you know  on the application  do you mind  working in a  smoking environment  they shouldn't 
[01:43:30]  have to be  subjected to that  sort of  and then on top  of that  all right  you've lost  that battle  I get it  and I  and I hate  smokers  and I hate  smoking  but I  you hate  smokers too  well yeah  just throw a  blanket over  everybody  I'm sorry  I hate  the smoker  all right  I hate  I hate  cigarette smoke  okay  made me stop  gambling up  in Mohegan  Sun  went up there  in Foxwoods  went to Foxwoods  and they have  a no smoking 
[01:44:00]  part of the casino  which is pretty  cool  went in there  but they close  it down  at about  two in the  morning  so then  at two  I figure  ah you know  I still want  to do some  gambling  and I went  into the  smoking section  here's what  you have to  sit next to  either some  Asian guy  or an  Arab guy  that is  smoking  like two  at a time  and the  ashtray is  right next  to you  and they're  just blowing  smoke  and you  can't  breathe  I mean  you cannot  breathe  so I had  to leave  the table  after like  ten minutes 
[01:44:30]  I couldn't  lose any  more money  I was  pissed  there was  a sports  arena in  Rochester  that was  smoke free  except for  one room  that you  were allowed  to smoke  in  and the  nickname  of the  place  was called  the  tomb  the  tomb  yeah  sometimes  in airports  that you  go to  around the  country  sometimes  they have  like a  glass  room  and you  can watch  the smokers  throw it  you can just  watch them  getting cancer  it's amazing  the whole room  the whole room  is just  full of smoke  oh  there's vents  at the top  and filters  and fans  that aren't  doing anything  and you 
[01:45:00]  look in there  and go  how could you  even step  in there  right  you just  stink  you know  two things  about the  law  what's funny  is they  can still  sell cigarettes  in restaurants  that you  can't smoke  in  you can still  sell cigarettes  but you can't  smoke them  in there  which is weird  you can buy  a pack  for eight bucks  or whatever  the hell  the going rate  is now  alright so we  lost that  battle  alright  now there's  like cigar bars  in New York  that they're  trying to  close down  the whole reason  those places  are open  is so you  can go  and have  a cigar  same principle  and I don't  smoke cigars 
[01:45:30]  either  but that's  the whole reason  these places  are in business  it's a place  for people  to go  to smoke  you're not  stumbling  into this place  going oh my god  I didn't know  people were going  to be smoking  in here  yeah  well they say  that the employees  are in danger  but it doesn't  make sense to me  that they're allowed  to shut down  you know  even smoking  lounges  yeah  this is a place  to go  that's specifically  for smoking  pretty much  yeah  and they're  shutting them  down  it's like  little finger  food  and they got  their whiskeys  and stuff 
[01:46:00]  and a full bar  yeah like that's fine  because I'm not  going to go in there  but most people  go there  to have a cigar  and they're trying  to shut those  places down  I don't get that  there's a place  downtown called  Hudson Barn Books  that you can't  get into  because you can  still smoke there  because so much  of their business  is tobacco  so but if say  you go in there  to smoke cigarettes  they charge you  two bucks  for every cigarette  you smoke  while you're in there  stop it  I swear to god  how do they know  how many are smoking  I think it's the  honor system  but it's pretty  the place is packed  you can't even  get in there  any night of the week  now  how do they charge you  does somebody  come up to you  and say two bucks 
[01:46:30]  or they give you a bill  there's a sign  when you walk in  and then there's a sign  at every table  and there's a sign  at the bar  and everything  yeah  or if you bring  in your own cigar  you know  because they sell  it all in there  I'm trying to figure  out how they do it  I think it's the  honor system  you know  I mean  how do you keep track  of everyone smoking  cigarettes  I mean people  really  yeah  especially in a crowded room  wow that's really weird  what's the justification  of two bucks  I don't know  that's a good question  is it costing them money  for you to come in there  and smoke  well because you're not  buying the cigarettes there  god that's hysterical  they should just allow  smoking establishments 
[01:47:00]  this is supposed to be  America land of the free  oh yeah  I'm sure there are a lot  of smoke still in Iraq  yeah yeah  this is the land  does seem to be  a little more free  than we are here  because you're not  you're not free  to do a lot of things  that's really  the selling point  of America  has been for many years  is hey  you know  it's America man  we're free  to do whatever  you want to do  it's a free country  thank god  we're free  to do  and the truth  of the matter is  you're really not 
[01:47:30]  free to do  much of anything  no  you're free  to adhere  to all of the rules  that's what you're  free to do  there's more rules  every day  every single day  there's more rules  in this country  every day  more rules  the second  the second  they notice  that you're free  to do something  they have to regulate it  I remember reading  about a month ago  there's some kind of  way to  atomize booze  to make it like a mist  and you put this mask on 
[01:48:00]  and you breathe in the booze  I love that story  I remember that  it takes about 20 minutes  to do a shot  you sit back  now 20 minutes  to do a shot  I could do like  5 shots in 20 minutes  you're hanging out  with your friends  drinking a few beers  and stuff  so it takes 20 minutes  to inhale this shot  and instead of going  through your stomach  you're getting the effects  like you would  if you smoked something  it's a mister  you know  it mists the booze  and immediately  well we need regulations 
[01:48:30]  against this  this is horrible  this is  now why is it so bad  you're drinking it  or ingesting it  slower than you would  if you were drinking it  you're controlling your drinking  but everyone freaked out  because it's alcohol  and it's some new way  to do it  so well  no no  we gotta figure out  a way  we gotta see if this  can still be picked up  on the breathalyzer  we gotta figure out  if this is dangerous  we gotta figure out  if people need to be  saved from this  if the kids are gonna  start using it  we need regulation  you're really not free 
[01:49:00]  to do anything  stop regulating  yeah please  you're driving us nuts  are you free to  if you wanted to  on a whim  just  go outside  naked  outside your house  and sit on a lounge chair  in the sun  on your front property  that you own  with nothing on  a man can dream  you know something  you're absolutely  not free to do that  no  you're free  can you just go outside  in your backyard 
[01:49:30]  and start blasting off  some rounds  into a phone book  in your backyard  no  you would get arrested  you can't discharge  firearms  within the city limits  unless it's in a  perfect spot  let's go a little further  are you free to take up  arms  against  the government  well that's why  we have  that old gag  right to bear arms  yeah that's  that old gag  why don't you go  outside right now  and try to  take up arms  against the government  and see what happens  get a little militia  together  yeah you and your  cute little gun 
[01:50:00]  while they bring in  the helicopters  you idiots  the apaches  and the tanks  come after you  you know  we need it  because it's  a deterrent  to the government  right  we need an armed society  just in case  we have to take  the government out  oh really  you're gonna use  your deer rifle  against a  howitzer  really  do you have  laser guided  missiles yet  at your house  from my  cold dead  hands  oh wait  I have  alzheimer's  from my  cold  dead  foot 
[01:50:30]  isn't that  the saying  I forgot  yeah so you really  you know  it's a great  selling point  for the country  and when the  immigrants want  to come over  and become  American  it's a great  selling point  hey you're free  to do everything  slow down  slow down  because you're  really not free  to do much  of anything  everything is  regulated  everything costs  money  you can't just  buy a car  and start driving  in a free country  shouldn't you be  able to take 
[01:51:00]  your money  that you earned  and buy a car  and just jump in it  and start driving  you should  but no  you need a license  you have to register it  you have to inspect it  it's gotta  you know  you gotta adhere  to all the rules  on the road  and if you screw up  they could take  all that away from  I bet you  in Iraq  you could just  find one of those  old Toyotas  and just start  driving around  an old Datsun  pickup  with a machine gun  in the back  you don't have to  worry about  registration  I'm driving  my friend  I'm driving  I am truly free  my friend  I'm driving 
[01:51:30]  insurance  you're free  now Iraq  car insurance  in Iraq  Iraq is a  freer country  right now  than the United  States of America  it's also like  the wild wild west  over there  but which was  a great time  in America  too  from what I read  I seem to  I think it was fun  you could just  get your horse  you ride out west  and pan for gold  Opie  and if somebody  wanted your gold  they'd try to shoot you  and you shoot back  at them  and if you kill them 
[01:52:00]  you're out of danger  for a day or two  there was a time  if you liked a piece of land  you just  started living there  you would stake  your claim  you know that river  near your house  try to like  just build a house  there on your own  yeah  if you see a nice piece  of property  that you like  right by your house  why not just lay down  some walls  and a roof on it  and start living there  and see what happens  to you  let's test this  freedom thing today  try that one out  build a house  on a nice piece of land  by a river  till the ground 
[01:52:30]  and grow the corn  and screw going to  Home Depot  just start chopping  down the trees  and make your own  log cabin  call yourself  Paw Ingalls  right  and just build  a soddy  by the river  hey you could  save a lot of money  give it a try  see what happens  in the land of the free  take your buckboard  into Sleepy Eye  for some supplies  and go back  to the house  you just built  see what happens  see if there's  someone waiting  there for you  hey what happened  I just built  my house  by Plum Creek 
[01:53:00]  I figured  I'd live here  it's a nice  plot of land  it's a free country  isn't it  oh it sure is  it sure is  I think you'd have  some marshals there  you think  your goods would be out  and there'd be  a big lock on the door  of the house  that you built  there's no real  freedom like that  in the way that  you know  it was many  many years ago  they regulate  everything  you're not free  to do anything  you go to work 
[01:53:30]  you have to go to work  every day  to live in this country  you can't not work  and live in the  United States of America  you can't not work  have you walked around  lately in the city  and look  and see what it is  it's homeless people  they're dregs of society  in this country  they're the outcasts  the people that you  don't want around  you can't just do that  and you have to  you gotta pay your taxes  right  it's not free  you make money  and it's a 50%  cut with the government  they're your partner 
[01:54:00]  we're in it together  partner  you know  that doesn't sound  very free  I mean  of course  people are going to say  well look at the alternatives  yeah  I don't want to live  in Iraq  I don't want to live  in a lot of countries  that aren't free  but don't be  don't be  delusional  and think you live  in this great free nation  where you are free  to do anything  and pursue these dreams  and hopes  no you're really not  food prices are  out of control  why don't you go  collect your own food  hunt for your own food 
[01:54:30]  why don't you give that a shot  to see how free  we really are  and what  you have to only be hungry  during hunting season  is that what it is  no I'm hungry  you know something  as you're driving down  I'm hungry right now  and I like bear  for dinner  right  I want a little  tasty bear meat  I'm going to go out  and get a bear today  you know something  I drive down the highways  and byways  of this great nation  of ours Opie  and a lot of times  you'll see a deer  on the side of the road  you're right  right  pull over  pull out your rifle 
[01:55:00]  and take a beat  on his little deer head  and just blast it off  now throw it on your  fender  or whatever it is  and take him home  that's some good eating  what's going to happen  if you get caught  with that deer  you're going to be fined  if not arrested  for blasting off your rifle  at the wrong place  at the wrong time  it doesn't seem  truly free to me  like that  why are we talking  about freedom today  how did this start  I don't know  I think 
[01:55:30]  are we free  to run this station  without an oompa loompa  I think that's probably  how it started  I don't know  oompa and anthony  i bought their asses  for a half a pack  of cools  the oompa and anthony show  hey what's up what's up precious hey little jimmy this is your big baby girl patrice o'neill how  you sweetie this is patrice o'neill uh the man who knew jimmy was gay first before anybody else  did chilling you're listening to opie and anthony here on xm radio man one yourselves go find your

[02:10:00]  then you can realize that you're probably in cleveland  or you can stand outside a building that should have black sabbath in it but instead they have fucking  arrowsmith and then realize you're in cleveland  or you can look for white people and see nothing but five thousand black guys standing at a bus stop with baseball bats  then you know you're in cleveland  you could  you could  you could  sir that was called being on a roll  you have to pull you may be blind but are you deaf with no comedic timing either  you fucking  you leukemia of comedy

[02:12:30]  all you're missing from that little collection is tampons and azp  i know it's so pathetic  it really is nauseating  i really can't defend that at all but  this is one of the worst colds going around  cause i had it uh... last week  last week  when we were doing the promotional tour anthony was sick  and i was thinking to myself  oh god  if he's sick  cause anthony never gets sick  it's coming my way i know it  yeah  and sure enough  you know the worst timing ever  we  we start the third stage of the opiate anthony show 
[02:13:00]  and uh... i am so out of it  it's not even funny  ill-fated  i know where i caught it from too  at mohegan sun handling those disgusting chips from those old people there  uh... off  those disgusting old  sniffling  yeah  and they're holding the chips  and of course it's going from one person to another you know  one person loses the uh... twenty bucks  you won twenty bucks  the dealer doesn't put it back in their stack  they give you the old snotty chips from the person next to you 
[02:13:30]  and then you got them in front of you  oh  it's disgusting  it's not going to stop me from gambling  it's wonderful  never ever  i'm sure that's where i got it  and i had a fever  uh...  about a week ago  i had a fever  that  and i  i never get fevers man  and i wound up getting fever junk  you know what fever junk is  yes i do  it's when your  your body is hot  i had a fever  it was over 101 
[02:14:00]  it isn't that bad  but it's a fever  your  your body tries to regulate the temperature  and if you know anything about the reproductive system  your testicles hang out of your body  right  because uh... the temperature has to be less than body temperature to make your sperm cells  is that why they hang outside  yes  i didn't know i thought that was just to humiliate a girl when you put them on her nose  alright see you learn something everyday my apologies  yes  i believe they have to be somewhere around 96 degrees to produce uh... sperm cells 
[02:14:30]  i've had the fever junk uh... the last two days  so when you have a fever  your sack is so low man  they're like click clacks  it's like click  you take two click clacks  remember that old kids toy  the click clacks  now take it  take it  and uh... uh...  get a fruit roll up  put it in the microwave for three minutes  now stick the click clacks in the fruit roll up  and hang it between your legs  that's pretty much what my sack was like  sticking to my thigh  and then your junk itself 
[02:15:00]  you know your your your schlong  uh... kinda hangs down too  it looks very impressive  when you go into the bathroom and look in the full length mirror  you're like wow  you got porn star junk  but uh... it gets annoying when you roll over in bed and it's you know your your sack is touching your ass  how did that happen  it's fever junk  it's all hot and bothered and trying to get away from your body  you know eventually we're gonna have to do what do we learn on the opian anthony show  fever junk 
[02:15:30]  hectic stuff still not set up  we don't know how to print out uh... feedback yet  we got a few line that still doesn't work  so it's a work in progress  uh... like we said they didn't have enough time four months to uh... to get our studio in order  and ben and steve are gonna probably brawl with uh... by friday i think  oh these two  yeah that's a match made in heaven man  steve could kick my ass i'm not i'm not even gonna you know try and fight him  did you even have to say that 
[02:16:00]  yeah  it's like hey by the way guys steve could kick my ass in case you didn't know  i don't know if steve has a listening problem or he's just deaf  no i i am partially deaf  so that's definitely  i don't like that steve could just talk from another room  martini steve  martini steve  see we have another sound clip today  i love it  it's a great nice addition to the show this martini steve music  we're coming back see  that's wonderful thank you so much 
[02:16:30]  no problem steve  steve's dressed very appropriately for work today  tattoos and uh...  who the fuck am i trying to impress  wait we can't hear you  yes  your audio is low sweetie  is it really  yeah i'll say  it's real low  really  yeah that's odd how's that  pick those thick lebanese fingers  and turn the  so ben how is steve supposed to dress  oh i don't know  ben who am i who am i trying to impress at six o'clock in the goddamn morning 
[02:17:00]  ben looks a little uh... nice  steve's got his shirt his collared button-down shirt on  it's orange  yeah  so  and you have the um...  cut off sleeve sculling crossbones  i'll just tell you a little story the other day me open steve went to lunch  after we were here during the day and we went to a restaurant over here in midtown  and they did not want to see steve they were mortified they tried to put us in a corner  and steve was wearing that exact same shirt and sleeves cut off  at a nice restaurant right 
[02:17:30]  exactly  so i put a jacket on whatever it was fine  yeah these two are gonna kill each other  and it won't be long  i like ben it's just he you know he's such an instigator sometimes he knows he's doing it too  he is an expert in prodding and poking he figures out what your buttons are and then he just goes right for them and he just doesn't stop until he gets blasted  you know what uh... club soda kenny said what he goes club soda kenny loves pulling gags on people all the time on perfect strangers you know he'll be uh... excuse me you dropped something and then the person looks around like they drop something or just go miss 
[02:18:00]  and then not look at the person the person thinks you were calling them those fun  little gags  uh... he can't do it in front of ben  he said to me it goes i can't do it  you know why  because ben will go right up to the person's face point at them and start laughing hysterically at the person  you're gonna get killed someday  kenny's too funny though  we were in boston on newberry street and the yankees were in town  and he's screaming  look it's the fucking new york yankees 
[02:18:30]  out in the middle of the street people were just mortified  that was one of the funny ones  they love him in boston  this is the worst of the opie and anthony show  this is opie  one half of the opie and anthony show  anthony i don't know where he is  he's probably listening to this in his car though  as i'm working  sitting here  saying stupid shit into a microphone  are you guys familiar with the mcgriddle sandwich from mcdonald's  the mcgriddle sandwich  what's that  what is the mcgriddle sandwich  it's uh... pancakes 
[02:19:00]  the bread is pancakes  and it's got little sploogies of syrup  into like scientifically and magically put into the pancake  i don't know how they do it but it's great  it's my favorite sandwich  it's the only thing that gets me up in the morning  anyway  yesterday  ten o'clock in the morning i'm driving  uh... into work  ate my mcgriddle sandwich  and little jimmy  at the first bite out of my mouth  that little sploogies of syrup squirts in my mouth  and little jimmy  calls uh... patty c  i believe it was action pork for blood cots  uh... referring to her period  i didn't even throw up 
[02:19:30]  perfect timing  daggin' and laugh at perfect timing  and ruin the sandwich for the rest of my life  so  alright  thank you sir  thanks mike  thanks guys  i did you a service believe me  speaking of throwing up  from eating something  eating something  did you guys see this in uh... yesterday's new york post  what  the segue  with this opie  is like it was planned  thank you anthony  thank you  bravo  thank you  the guy talks about his mcgriddle sandwich 
[02:20:00]  and how he almost puked eating it  opie goes scurrying to  through the through the papers  and finds  this story  yep  that's the professionalism  i'm so glad you see my importance  that gives you the multi-million dollar experience  i'm so glad you see my importance on this show  of course  thank you  this is a tightly run ship  i'm one step above earl pushing buttons  but thank you  thank you  speaking of which anthony  yes  yes  gal finds condom and pastry  oh  could you imagine 
[02:20:30]  oh  a young manhattan woman uh... split open her breakfast muffin  only to find what seemed to be a condom baked inside  oh my god  yeah  and that is really bad  not only is it a condom  oh they got a picture  yeah not only is it a condom which is bad enough okay  but it  if it was a condom that wasn't used yet it would be all rolled up  oh god  and quite frankly i think  you could you know throw the condom aside and still enjoy your breakfast  oh stop it  you are kidding me 
[02:21:00]  you would you would eat that muffin if an unused condom was in it  well if the line was really long why get back on the line  oh  you see the condom wasn't used it  ah a little misfortune  you know there's a penis in it  are unused condoms allowed in the pastries  no sir  but this condom  was obviously  oh  used  it's a dead little fish  you know what she should have done she should have like just squeezed it out on top of the muffin and said i can't believe it's not butter 
[02:21:30]  oh  oh my god i'm gonna puke  ah  ugh  it came with it's own spread  i was gonna say you know  it came with it's own icing you know  whatever you want to put on it  a little icing for the muffin  ugh  i'm getting the heebie jeebies  that is really heebie jeebie inducing  Teresa Van Horn  usually you know when this crap happens in the paper you're like alright someone's trying to get money  yeah a lot of people  yeah  i mean  they do  really come on you found a rat in your mcdonald's breakfast come on 
[02:22:00]  right  but it looks kinda legit  it's a  Teresa Van Horn a 29 year old writer at mtv network said she was eating a carrot nut cream cheese  that wasn't cream cheese  oh  stop  what kind of muffin was it  a carrot nut  carrot nut cream cheese  what are you a vegan?  who buys those  from her office building's bodega on west 50th street when she found a piece of latex baked into the crumbly delicacy  mmm  no extra charge  alright here's where i got a problem 
[02:22:30]  i ate almost half the muffin before discovering it  oh  good  when she took a bite and pulled back and it snapped into her face  a la cartoon style  boing  uh  then it was like  spinning in her mouth like a shade when you roll it down  dude listen to this  the window shade  i ate almost half the muffin before discovering it  then it was like slow motion when i pulled it out  i was screaming  nooooo  and of course cause this is what you need for the lawsuit 
[02:23:00]  since the incident last tuesday morning she said she's lost her appetite  that crap is bull  can't eat can't sleep can't have sex  no you get right back  give me millions of dollars  maybe you don't eat for like a couple hours but then the hunger pains happen and then you're eating  you're gonna eat  i ran down there and got another muffin immediately  give me  really  yeah give me one without a rubber  that's it  please  problem solved  yeah  van horn called the health department to report it but was told not to bother  go ahead and throw away the evidence a representative told her over the phone 
[02:23:30]  of course they'd like they'd want to be bothered with anything  idiots  we won't get to your complaint for days or maybe weeks  yeah they just didn't want to be bothered  they don't want to be bothered  they just didn't want to be bothered  and it goes on and on but there you go  finds a condom and a muffin and the stupid health department doesn't want to do anything about it  i don't care  what asses  so  it goes on and on but there's the story  was it a magnum at least  i don't know  big boy  i don't know it kind of looks shriveled in the baking process  it looks like it was definitely cooked in there and uh... it looks like a used condom 
[02:24:00]  and no one's weird she said she ate half the muffin  but this i mean look she barely has a couple bites out of the muffin and there's the condoms  you know sitting right next to the muffin  and then there's some crumbs  pick it up with the condom  pick up those crumbs  get a good one  get a good one  yo what's up  hey this is chris rock  but you're still listening to opie and anthony  so check them out would you  sons of bitches  he's up on the gay shit  oh gee  the worst of opie and anthony

[02:36:30]  fucking craig  craig christ  craig christ  craig christ  craig christ  i'm fucking craig  Yeah, right on, man.  Steven Lynch on the Opie and Anthony Show.  You can hear your sinuses.  And you don't have to censor yourself.  I love this.  That's awesome.  Isn't it awesome?  I've never been able to play that on the radio before. 
[02:37:00]  Seriously?  No.  First time I do.  How did you do that?  Oh, yeah.  I keep forgetting that no one else gets to play this game.  I'm gosh darn gray.  I tried to play it on Carson Daly.  All right.  It was like that scene from The Doors, and the guy goes, you know, you can't say, girl,  we couldn't get much higher.  Right.  Fuck, girl, we couldn't get much better.  Exactly.  He's like, you can't say, spend the night together.  You could say, spend some time together.  Right.  Yeah.  I couldn't say, fucking.  I couldn't say, gay.  I couldn't say, Jesus. 
[02:37:30]  And I couldn't say, Christ.  Yeah, that's...  Well, I might wreck the song a little bit.  That's a little bit.  That's called Kill a Kitten, that song.  That's great.  No, because you can't say kill or kitten.  Right.  We keep forgetting that we're the only ones that get to play on this field.  It's awesome.  It's unbelievable.  We have no idea what this thing could do yet, either.  We're learning as we go.  I can stop writing, you know, innuendo.  Yeah.  You could just go for it.  Right out.  To the jugular.  Go get him.  The DVD is live at the El Rey.  Stephen Lynch, and he's playing Town Hall on Saturday. 
[02:38:00]  Thanks for coming by.  My pleasure.  I'm just kidding.  He went for it.  It's like, what?  He's kicking me out already?  That's always the worst.  What Ope starts with?  Yeah, well, they're telling us you've got to get out of here quick.  And you're like, no, but who's telling you that?  There's nobody saying that.  Yeah, but they're saying you've got to get moving down the road.  You touch your ear like there's something in there.  I'm getting, yes, yes, we're going to have to go.  He fell for it.  I did fall for it, too.  Dude, you really think that we prepared enough for this show to get us to 10 o'clock? 
[02:38:30]  Guess who's going to do it.  I think we've been doing it for two years.  I really do have to go, though, seriously.  Oh, you've got to go.  Yes!  The reversal.  Shame, motherfucker.  The reversal.  I went, holy crap, what counting on him to get us to 10 o'clock today?  Oh, man, that's funny.  Well, what else can we play?  I'm trying to remember the old days.  There were so many songs we couldn't play, or you had a censor.  Do you have new songs?  Where do you want to go with this?  Yeah, I have some new songs.  Oh, the new stuff.  Let me, yeah.  I got one that's not even on the DVD or either of the records yet. 
[02:39:00]  Is it a brand new one?  Is this a, because you know how people scream out from the crowd, do new stuff.  Do new stuff.  Yeah, they always do that, right?  Yeah.  Freebirds!  Yeah, let me try this one.  It's a song about the truth.  I wrote it about a lady I was seeing not too long ago.  Hopefully I'll remember the lyrics.  Have a seat and listen. 
[02:39:30]  Please don't say a thing.  In matters of their hearts and times.  The truth will have a sting.  Just don't take it personally.  This is no attack.  But we will never last.  Because I'm white.  And you are also white.  I only like black girls, the brown girls, the cafe au lait.  The caramel girls and mocha girls just blow me away.  If you are newbie, and I want you to be in every fantasy. 
[02:40:00]  But if you're a whitey, say nighty-nighty.  You're just not the girl for me.  Well, her body is a turn-on, curvaceous front and back.  Her hair is quite literally an aphrodisiac.  Don't call it jungle fever, because that just isn't right.  I am not a racist.  Some of my best friends are white. 
[02:40:30]  I just prefer black girls, the brown girls, the cafe au lait.  The caramel girls and mocha girls just blow me away.  Well, if you're a cracker, you better get blacker, or else you best get out.  It is no mystery.  I like a sister.  See, that's what I'm talking about.  Oh, man, I hate vanilla ice cream.  White rice is so bland.  The milk chocolate melts in your mouth, not in your hand. 
[02:41:00]  But color is not the issue here.  It's dignity.  It's class.  It's all about her heart.  Okay, it's partly about that ass.  I want me some black girls, the brown girls, the cafe au lait.  The caramel girls and mocha girls just blow me away.  Well, if you're a honky, you're singing the wrong key.  It's the honest truth.  The skin that she's dwelling in must contain melanin.  That is the fond of you.  Thomas Jefferson. 
[02:41:30]  Robert De Niro.  Well, strong thermal.  Strong thermal.  Yeah.  Nice.  Yes.  Thank you.  A world premiere?  Well, no, it's not a world premiere. 
[02:42:00]  I played it at the shows before.  Well, a radio world premiere.  There you go.  I like that one.  It's like how TBS says world premiere.  Jaws world premiere.  It's like, what?  I think I've seen this before.  At this exact second on TBS on my television with me standing here in my room?  Is that what you're talking about?  World premiere.  World premiere.  Planet of the Apes.  The original.  What?  Really?  First time ever.  That was very nice.  I like that one a lot.  Thanks, man. 
[02:42:30]  What else?  People requesting.  I know.  People requesting.  They're requesting.  They're requesting.  Of course, old school.  The old shit.  Well, I want to see where Steven wants to go.  Because they're requesting Special Olympics.  They're requesting Hermaphrodite.  They're requesting full-blown AIDS.  Full-blown AIDS.  The FBA song.  The FBA song.  You know, we need a new copy of FBA because the old place owns all our material, so we  can't play any of that, so you're safe finally.  All right.  FBA. 
[02:43:00]  We got Lynch on a weak moment, and who wrote that song?  Jay Moore.  It was Jay Moore, right?  Mike DiNicola.  And Mike DiNicola wrote this FBA full-blown AIDS song.  And Steven Lynch, I think it was all the beer that we were all drinking back then.  Yeah.  It's a little safe around here because we're doing morning radio, and we got Lynch.  You can't drink as much this early.  We got Lynch in a weak moment, and he sung the lyrics to this full-blown AIDS song, and  it followed him for the next, what, like five years, pretty much.  Yeah, it was a curse, man.  It was a curse.  And we did a road show, and the song got so popular, 2,000 people are singing along 
[02:43:30]  to the song.  Well, then I made the mistake in another moment of weak drunkenness to actually write  my own second verse to it.  Right, right, right.  Yeah.  Fucking retarded.  You got totally roped in.  I was like putting my stamp of approval on it.  Yeah, yeah.  So, maybe someday we'll get a new version of that.  Someday.  But everyone's requesting songs.  I don't know where you want to go.  I love all the Steven works songs.  What do you guys want, man?  I mean, you've heard all these songs before.  It's not much fun.  Well, I love To Kill a Kitten.  I love Alter Boy.  Alter Boy's a little ditty that we like. 
[02:44:00]  Especially...  Sure.  You want that one?  Given the circumstances of us being here.  Of our demise, yeah.  What do you want to play, Steven?  I can play that one.  People requesting the bowling song, too.  A lot of you.  I'm not kidding.  They're very funny, motherfuckers.  They are.  That last CD you put out, though?  To your clothes, motherfucker.  Dude, I turned on so many people to that last CD.  Oh, nice.  You finally got it right on the CD, I'm telling you.  In front of the live audience.  It was definitely the way to go.  What was the name of that CD? 
[02:44:30]  Because that one is...  Superhero.  Superhero.  I'm telling you, if you see that CD in your record store, or if you see it on Kazaa...  Record store.  Kazaa is going away soon, actually.  Is it?  They're starting to fight that down in Washington.  But that CD is unbelievable.  It really is.  Thank you, man.  All right.  So, play what you want, man.  What are you feeling today?  I'll play that one.  What, the bowling song?  No, not the bowling song.  Look at how upset I'm here.  You're going to play the bowling song?  I learned my lesson from that one.  No, I'll play the priest song. 
[02:45:00]  All right.  Deep in prayer, my cross to bear, I kneel upon the floor.  Temptations of a Catholic priest aren't easy to ignore. 
[02:45:30]  But I cannot control myself.  It rips my soul apart.  For one small sheep among my flock has stole the shepherd's heart.  Altar boy, altar boy, confess your sins to me.  You will find the grace of God inside my rectory. 
[02:46:00]  At Sunday, Mass or Bible class, I catch him in my view.  So I close my eyes, but there he lies, spread eagle on the pew.  Yeah, when I see him in that frock, my conscience goes awry.  I'll give him some communion wine. 
[02:46:30]  That's spike with Spanish fly.  Altar boy, altar boy, is it going to be heaven or hell?  You can play my organ all night long.  If you promise never to tell.  Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. 
[02:47:00]  Altar boy, altar boy, confess your sins to me. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah, you will find the grace of God inside my rectory.  Oh, altar boy, oh, altar boy, confess your sins to me.  You will find the grace of God inside. 
[02:48:00]  My rectory.  My rectory.  My rectory.  Oh, man, that never gets old. 
[02:48:30]  Stephen Lynch on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The DVD live at the L. Ray.  Nice.  And he's playing Town Hall here in New York City Saturday.  I got to go.  I'll be there Saturday without a doubt, man.  It's going to be fun.  Yeah, I'm with Mitch Hedberg.  Oh, really?  You're touring with Mitch these days?  Yeah, we're nice.  We're doing a tour.  So what's the deal?  Is his leg falling off?  What was that?  He seems to be fine.  I mean, I've heard all the rumors, but I've seen none of the craziness. 
[02:49:00]  The rumor was going around that he did so many...  Was it drugs?  Yeah.  I'm just going with the rumors.  That he was doing so many drugs that he had gangrene and he was going to lose a limb?  That's what I heard, yeah.  He looks like everything's okay, though.  I'm a hard subject to broach with somebody that you're on tour with, you know?  But you are taking a...  Have a good set tonight.  How's the fucking gangrene leg?  Break out.  Well, you know, whatever.  But you are taking peeks.  You are taking peeks and taking a look to see, right?  You're trying to figure it out.  Well, he's usually wearing pants when he's in my company, but I haven't... 
[02:49:30]  He's walking pretty good and stuff?  Yeah, he seems to be fine.  I don't know.  Dude, he's going to lose the leg soon.  He's hilarious.  That's morbid.  Yeah, well, it's been going around on the Internet.  You know, and the Internet's always...  Oh, I thought like a sickness.  So lose your leg disease.  It's been going around.  I know three people.  You read it on the Internet.  It's got to be true, so...  All right, why don't we take a break, regroup a little bit,  and we'll have more with Stephen Lynch in just a bit here.  Hey, everybody.  It's Stephen Lynch.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[02:50:00]  And also, I have herpes.  I know.  That's it.  It's awesome.  Everything I wish I didn't know  So chill  Give me something  I can see  This is the Opie and Anthony show,  the ONA virus spreading across America  thanks to XM Satellite Radio,  the best satellite radio company in the world.  XM.  XM Satellite Radio. 
[02:50:30]  Actually got to have three bites of my bagel during that long break.  This is a weird thing.  We don't break for commercials anymore.  We go...  Are your mics on?  Hold on.  Okay.  Yeah, we don't really break that much.  We're supposed to break twice an hour,  and we just talk for an hour and a half straight.  We used to be able to go out, play some foosball,  mix some drinks up, smoke cigarettes, pot, whatever.  You remember when we started bringing in the bartender, right?  No.  Oh, what?  Yeah, we were rolling a bar in on Friday. 
[02:51:00]  I remember the Jaeger machine.  The Jaeger machine was key.  That was the best.  Man.  Middle of the show,  you race the Razor Rollerboard scooter down to the office,  pour out some icy cold Jaeger,  a couple of shots,  back to the studio for the beers.  Right, the fridge.  Lynch wants to ask for a beer so bad,  but he thinks he's out of place.  Like, whoa.  Just have one, man.  Nobody cares.  Drink.  It doesn't make any sense at what time it is in the morning.  They didn't get the refrigerator set up in the office yet.  They're still building our office, so.  Are they building it?  Or has anything been done?  No. 
[02:51:30]  Nothing has been done.  Nothing?  As far as the office goes?  No.  No.  Did work stop on the vestibule area for our security thing?  Yeah, I think there's a work stoppage going on.  Because I saw the walls went up,  the sheetrock's up, but that's it.  I notice when we start talking bad about things,  like the work slows down.  The work slows down?  Yeah, gee.  Are we dealing with unions over here?  What?  We got a work stoppage.  I think we have a work stoppage.  You keep bitching, things ain't going to get done.  Yeah, we talked bad a couple days ago.  We love being here, but there's growing pains, 
[02:52:00]  and we're figuring it all out.  You want the room, though?  I got a room for you.  It's a 55-gallon drum buried in Queens.  You like that, huh?  Hold on.  This guy has a problem with our channel 202.  It's Tom in Brooklyn.  What's up, Tom?  Hey.  Hey.  All right, guys.  Welcome back, guys.  Oh, thank you.  Listen, I've been calling up XM complaining, right?  Every time you go north of 96th in the city,  the station waffles, right?  Who the hell is, you know, I mean,  you turn to any other channel, and it works right. 
[02:52:30]  And you get, you know, I got this for you because of you guys.  So you go past 96th Street in Manhattan, and our channel fades out?  That's the shwuggy filter.  Yes.  I'm sure you're going to be at a golfer.  You are.  I mean, what about a golfer?  You do know you're the only person to have noticed that so far,  because nobody above 96th Street wants to listen to this program.  Right.  I'm sure.  I'm sure.  You're dealing with a shwuggy filter.  Maybe you don't.  In Harlem, and in the Bronx, you know, I build houses up here.  And, you know, I can't get you guys. 
[02:53:00]  Tom, maybe you can't hear it, because the second you get up there,  the unit gets stolen from your car.  All right.  All right.  He's having a problem listening to us in Harlem, Anthony.  Oh.  Yeah.  I mean, we've talked a renaissance going on up there, though.  It's all nice from what I hear.  Yeah, it actually is.  I took a walk up there with Earl.  A lot of money being poured into that area.  Because I'm obsessed with the black culture.  Yes, you are.  That's why I like the new black song that Lynch does.  The new colored tune.  Jeez. 
[02:53:30]  This is my new colored tune.  I think the residents in Harlem are very happy, too.  They really like to see, like, all these nice places going up  and some middle-class white people moving in.  It really makes them feel good.  There go the neighborhood.  So I don't know if we even have beer here for you.  Isn't that a shame?  Remember all the beer we used to have, too?  We had refrigerators in our office that we got to put food in.  They got filled up with beer.  So we had to get another refrigerator.  And this one was like, okay, look, those are the beer fridges. 
[02:54:00]  We need one for food.  And then we put a big sign on the fridge, food.  Food and beer.  And then beer.  And we made it very simple.  Within a week.  It was a week.  Food fridge full of beer.  Of course, the beer fridge was full of beer.  And then they rolled in a cooler for some kind of, like, a Snapple-type beverage.  And they had a full-size, like, you walk into a deli and you get these huge coolers,  and it was for this beverage.  It was probably Snapple or Sobe, one of those.  Sobe, I think. 
[02:54:30]  Full of beer.  Yeah.  After a while.  And that was the good one because it was closer to the studio.  We didn't have to walk as far for our beer.  You know what happened?  We all became alcoholics because all the beer companies were competing against each other  for our attention.  So all of a sudden, the Budweiser palate would be wheeled into our office.  And then, oh, Sam Adams didn't want to be cases upon cases.  Sam Adams would come in with their beer.  Yeah.  And then Bacardi would come in with Bacardi girls and mix drinks for us.  Yeah.  We were snotted. 
[02:55:00]  We really were snotted.  I was drinking.  How do we make that happen?  And no one had the, what do I personally have to do to make that happen?  No one had the balls to tell us no.  That was the funny part about it.  Dude, I was drinking every day in there.  Every day.  Before the show, drinking beer in the office.  Yeah.  During the show, there was always a bottle.  Sure.  Sam or Bud or something hammered every day.  After the show, we'd get done, go into the office.  I'd start playing video games and just drinking beer. 
[02:55:30]  It was crazy.  How many beers did you drink during our show?  Seriously.  During the show?  Like, as the show was on?  Before or after the whole day?  Per day?  How about the pre-show?  All right.  We were on the air at 3, so let's say from 2 p.m. and then...  Two beers before the show.  And then the post-game.  Two beers before the show.  Two beers before the show.  Right.  During the show, probably eight.  I was going to say at least six.  Probably.  No, it was more than six.  All right.  Eight beers.  Eight beers during the show.  Now we're up to ten beers as we're trying to be responsible broadcasters. 
[02:56:00]  Now I understand why our judgment was a little foggy on that day.  Impaired.  On August 15, 2002.  Should have had a breathalyzer.  It's every weekday.  Yeah.  And after the show was probably...  Another two.  Another...  No, more after the show.  Because we used to hang out for a while, watch the Simpsons and play video games.  It was like doing a radio show with William Holden.  You were non-stop with the booze.  Just drinking like a maniac.  But I've known Anthony for a long time.  You cannot tell when he's buzzed.  That's the strangest thing about it. 
[02:56:30]  No, I'm one of those guys.  I could be really drunk and...  I've been pulled over and hammered off my ass and just talked to the cop and not even...  He didn't even have an inkling that I had been drinking.  Well, maybe it's because of all the stuff that the NYPD gives you to make you look like  you're a detective.  Yeah.  I used to get some good stuff.  You know, I was the only one.  Everyone...  Everyone...  Listen to me.  Remember 9-11?  Remember that time the buildings fell?  Remember that day?  Remember that?  Well, after 9-11, Lower Manhattan, shut down. 
[02:57:00]  You're done.  You ain't coming through here.  We had to drive all the way up to like the Williamsburg or something.  It was crazy.  Something crazy.  The Queensborough Bridge or the Midtown Tunnel to get into Manhattan.  The cops gave me these window placards where I was the only one in a civilian vehicle driving  through the Battery Tunnel from Brooklyn into Lower Manhattan.  Yeah, most people get the cute PBA cards and they show their friends like, look, I'm going  to get out of everything now.  I had stuff, window placards, cards, things where even the tunnel guys I'd be going through 
[02:57:30]  and they'd look like to stop me and then, oh, wave me on.  Wave...  And I'm being waved through with big trucks, cop vehicles, ambulance.  I come popping out of the other side of the Battery Tunnel.  It's just wreckage and I'm driving through it.  I got to get to work.  I got to get to my beer.  So, we're slowly putting the old show back together.  Right.  Well.  Slowly.  I shan't be drinking that much.  No, no.  Can't drink in the morning.  No, we got to be responsible.  Can't drink in the morning.  Can't, Anthony?  It totally... 
[02:58:00]  It takes the edge off the heroin and, you know, I'm trying to work on that now.  We're going to figure out what we can put in our coffee.  Yeah?  Yeah, I think that's the way to go.  Coffee with a shot.  Because alcohol is great in like any time afternoon.  Right.  But, I don't know.  For morning, you really need some kind of drug.  What's a good morning drug?  A few bumps in the bathroom.  Vicodin?  A few bumps in the bathroom.  A few bumps in the...  I don't want to do like blow or anything that's going to bring me up. 
[02:58:30]  Crank with a nice light for mornings.  I need something that's going to feel like booze.  No, because that's like...  You're all up.  You're grinding your teeth.  I need something that's like booze.  But it's a drug, so it's cool to do in the morning.  Hmm.  Vicodin?  Ecstasy?  Pop a tab?  I need you to...  Could you take some glow sticks and wave them in front of my face?  Lock on the guy from Frank's place.  Why is Anthony massaging my shoulders this morning?  Spray me down with water.  Locked out of the Oompa Loompa, fucking his ear.  Oxycontin.  Some Oxycontin? 
[02:59:00]  Yeah, that's pretty good.  Try some Oxycontin.  Speaking of 9-11.  Holy ass.  What's going on with these commemorative coins?  Remember 9-11.  That was hilarious.  You know, right when I saw the commercials, I don't think there's an American alive that  was watching TV, sees the commercial for these commemorative coins.  Remember 9-11?  I don't think there's an American alive that watched that and went, oh yeah, that's a great  product.  Boy, thank God someone's exploiting this and putting out a piece of shit coin that's a silver 
[02:59:30]  plated.  If you took the silver content off of that, you couldn't fill a mouse tooth with it.  And they're making it sound like it's real silver.  And emblazoned on the front are the towers that we lost on September 11th.  On the backside is the new Freedom Tower rising like a phoenix in its place.  And the money coming out of your pocket and going into our accounts as we exploit this. 
[03:00:00]  That company, I actually called them when I saw a commercial.  I've never done that before and left a vile, awful message on the machine.  I'm sure they're just laughing at it.  Like they care, oh, we better stop selling this.  So this man sounds a little aggravated with us.  Who approved this and who's getting the money?  Whatever the company's name was, they list it.  It's a company, I believe, in Wyoming.  And they got these coins printed on some South Pacific island.  But I saw one commercial, they're claiming some of this metal came from the actual site. 
[03:00:30]  Right.  They're saying that the silver was in a vault that was in the tower and they dug it out  got the silver, melted it down, and made these coins.  It's probably technically true, like when Kiss did the comic book in 77, their blood went  into the ink.  They probably, like you take a little bit and melt it in.  Are you kidding me?  Yeah, they poured vials of their blood into the ink.  That's true.  Technically, it was in there.  Kiss is so cool.  This is also the same company, by the way, that came out with the Andrea Yates commemorative 
[03:01:00]  bathtub rubber duckies.  Jesus.  Dude, the New York Times reporter's right next to you.  I'm sorry.  We're trying to look clever here.  This is our clever book.  That's a great reference.  No one talks about Andrea Yates.  It was brilliant.  Trust me, it was brilliant.  Yeah, Spitzer's on the case, and this guy's usually an ass, but...  Elliot Spitzer, he's looking out for you.  He really is this time around.  Shame, shame, shame on you.  It was a shameless attempt to profit from a national tragedy, obviously.  Yeah.  So they have these things printed up on some South Pacific island, and the commercial is  so misleading. 
[03:01:30]  But if you have half a brain, you can kind of figure it out for yourself.  They were saying, legal tender, and it says, in God we trust, and one dollar on it.  But it's not a legal dollar.  So saying legal tender isn't legal.  It's printed on some South Pacific island, so it says, sanctioned by the government.  They don't say what?  The government.  So they don't say what government?  Making it sound like it's sanctioned by the United States, which it's not. 
[03:02:00]  They say 100 mil of pure silver.  It's like a one hundredth of a millimeter of silver plated over brass.  Or bronze, not even brass.  So you're getting nothing for $39.  A one dollar coin for $39.  I'm sure most of the people watching the commercials are assuming this is going for a good cause.  Yeah.  You know?  It's going for their cause.  Money in their pockets is going for a good cause. 
[03:02:30]  They don't, right?  I think they, no, it's not even advertised that it's going for a good cause.  But I think the feel of the commercial, it almost feels like they're going to be giving this away.  I get to do my part.  I'm doing a good thing.  It is.  They say something like, do your part as an American and buy these, you know.  It just feels dirty, though.  How dumb are people?  Pretty dumb.  To not know that they're not going to make a coin with towers and a freedom tower.  It's just, how stupid is the public?  People are stupid.  Dude, I got in a huge fight down at Ground Zero.  I actually tipped over one of those car tables because, uh.  Wow, the destruction you wrought down there. 
[03:03:00]  Oh, I heard you kicked a chair once.  A tipped table?  How'd they clean that up down there?  I tipped over a table.  Jesus.  And the police got involved and stuff, but they saw what I was doing and they let me be.  I got so pissed off.  I skated down to Ground Zero.  I'm checking out the scene, right?  And they were still, um, I don't know if they're still doing, I haven't been down there in a while,  but they were still, uh, selling the pictures of the towers on fire.  Oh, there were some ragheads and stuff selling these.  I mean, if you're, what a suicidal piece of shit. 
[03:03:30]  These guys were selling pictures of the towers on fire.  Completely on fire.  Big 8x10 photos here in the city, on fire, you know,  Oh, would you like to buy, what?  How are you alive?  You look at this guy like, how is he still alive?  And I had a moment, I got in a fight with the guy and he didn't even speak English,  but he's kind of getting in my face like, you know.  Go figure that out in New York City.  He's pretty much like, tough shit, what are you going to do about it?  That's the feeling I got by how he was like, reacted to it. 
[03:04:00]  It was those cheap little car tables, he had all his displays, I just went for it.  Knocked the whole thing all.  Tipped it over?  Not just tipped it over, I just completely just destroyed the display.  I'm just picturing you all pissed off, getting into a fight,  and then you skate away in your little slow motion like a video.  I didn't skate away.  How do you leave angrily on skates?  You're right.  How do you leave?  Yeah.  I showed him.  I showed him.  It's like hopping on a pogo stick and pogoing away. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah, asshole.  Who did this to you?  That guy pirouetting over there.  Don't make me come back here.  Boing, boing, boing, boing.  Gling, gling with the bell.  Gling, gling, gling, gling.  Yeah, I'm coming back for you.  Out of my way.  Wow.  I figured I'd share.  Top guy.  I did my part. 
[03:05:00]  Showed him as he rollerblades away.  You're lucky I'm wearing woman's footwear.  Puts both arms behind his back, leans forward and skates away.  Speed skating fashion.  I showed him.  Oh, boy.  Boy, did I show him.  We got more info on the coins.  Tad from San Francisco.  Hey, Tad.  Hey.  I actually did some research on the Internet when I first saw these commercials. 
[03:05:30]  As you can tell, I stay up pretty late listening to the show and stuff like that.  So I'm always watching TV.  And they started these commercials right about the anniversary of it.  And, yeah, I was like the 12th or something.  I saw that and I just flipped out.  But I did some research on it.  They're minted by the North Marianas Islands, which is actually part of the United States.  It's a commonwealth that we're in charge of. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah, I'm sure we really.  I'm sure it's just like, you know, Nebraska.  I'm sure they're one of the countries that sent help in Iraq.  There's four of them.  The Coalition of the Willing?  Yeah.  The actual U.S. Mint put out a thing that said.  Easter Island sent, like, five heads to Iraq as a coalition of the willing.  Five of those big Easter Island heads.  So they're part of the coalition, which is nice.  Yes.  Sorry, sir.  Yes, go ahead.  Canary Island sent three canaries. 
[03:06:30]  They just talk all day.  Go ahead.  Come on, Tad.  Let's go.  Sorry I keep interrupting, Tad.  But I would like to throw some entertainment on this program.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, Tad, make your point.  Well, the thing is that they're now saying they actually stole this.  They keep saying it's recovered silver.  Yeah.  But it was stolen from some bank vault.  I guess they sent people in there in the middle of the night or something to sneak in and steal this silver  that actually belongs to some bank here in New York. 
[03:07:00]  Well, not here, but there in New York.  This numismatic humor.  You know what?  I don't even think the silver came from ground zero.  How do they prove that?  You know?  I know.  How do you prove that one?  You don't.  It's just like when we all got a piece of the Berlin Wall when that came down.  Oh, yeah.  How do we know that?  I have a piece at home.  I know.  How do I know that my little piece was actually from the Berlin Wall?  Yeah, I got a piece of the Berlin Wall.  It's a piece of chipped cement off the divider on the FDR.  That's what it is.  Hey, look at that.  Freedom.  Great. 
[03:07:30]  But it gives you that little paper to prove that it came from the Berlin Wall.  And it's got to be true.  Authenticity.  Authenticity.  Thank you, Jim.  Certificate of Authenticity.  That's what they give, too, is a certificate of authenticity.  Authenticity.  For what?  That it's a coin?  Yeah.  That it's round?  That it weighs something and you can roll it?  That the metal came from ground zero or close to ground zero?  No.  They're not fessing up.  Well, if it was stolen, I'm sure Fat Liz Taylor has a few copies.  God almighty.  This greedy bitch.  She owns a painting that supposedly is an old Nazi booty stolen from where? 
[03:08:00]  From the Jews?  Were they stealing from anyone else?  From the French?  The French just gave it to them.  Yeah.  No, it's supposed to be somebody saying, hey, that's my painting.  It's my family's painting.  It was stolen.  And Liz Taylor just ain't fessing up.  No.  She wants it.  She just rolls it up and puts it under that awful wig and walks around.  You are a disgusting fat body, Liz Taylor.  All right.  Give me my painting. 
[03:08:30]  Why don't we get another song from Stephen Lynch?  All righty.  He is in here.  He's got his guitar.  He came prepared.  Jaime set up the whole studio for music today.  Stephen Lynch has a DVD out called Live at the El Rey, and he's playing Town Hall here  in New York City on Saturday.  It's a sold-out show, I believe.  You want to promote any other dates?  Are they on your website?  Yeah, L.A. next week.  L.A. is at the Wiltern on the 21st.  And then Vegas on the 22nd.  What place in Vegas?  Back at the House of Blues. 
[03:09:00]  Hey, ever hear the George Carlin House of Blues bit?  I have.  Maybe we should play that, Opie.  I'd love to hear that.  You obviously just got your XM Satellite Radio hooked up.  Jesus Christ.  I know what you're talking about.  I've been playing 8,000 times on this show.  Yeah, we used to...  No more Carlin.  We used to love George Carlin.  We now hate him.  Yeah, I understand.  I'm at the point now, if I see him, I'll punch George Carlin in the face, and he'll have  no clue why.  Yeah.  Stop talking, George.  What?  I didn't see him.  What?  Okay.  You punch him numerous times.  He goes, shit!  Oh, piss!  Oh, fuck!  Cut!  Oh, cocksucker! 
[03:09:30]  Motherfucker!  Tits.  There you go.  No reason to do six.  Nothing?  All right, so what do we want to play today?  I don't know.  Are you getting requests, or do you just want me to do something?  Something you can't play on commercial radio?  Oh, very good.  What do you want to hear, Anthony?  There's Kill a Kitten, there's the gerbil song, there's...  Oh, the gerbil song.  Richard Gere has a movie out.  Down to the Old Pub Instead could be kind of cool, because we got a brand new wiffle ball 
[03:10:00]  bat, Stephen Lynch, and it still hasn't been broken in, because a girl came in here,  I don't know, Monday, and she was ready to do the wiffle ball bat challenge, but her  friend arrived.  Yes.  Her friend arrived.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Yesterday, we actually had a girl with self-esteem, which was irritating.  Yeah.  What?  Who has self-esteem?  I'm not putting that in me.  Yeah, but yesterday, we had an escort with...  An escort with self-esteem.  With self-esteem.  Yeah.  Only on our show.  You know that by now.  We have the worst luck.  Yeah, you do. 
[03:10:30]  Jimmy, don't defend.  Don't defend her.  I have to.  She didn't like you as a person.  She did like me.  She didn't like you.  She thought I was cute and in shape.  She didn't like you.  It's like a girl with self-esteem came in.  She's all, God damn, come on.  She liked my appendix scar.  She thought it adds character.  Hold on.  Before 10 o'clock, we got to get the review of the girl that Norton was with last night.  Yes.  Norton had a dating experience last night.  I heard a little bit of that on my way over here.  Yeah, so we got to get her review of the whole night. 
[03:11:00]  That's her.  Oh, wow.  Free of charge.  Well, that always works.  Oh, let me see you in the magazine.  Yeah, that always works on the radio.  Oh, yeah, you're right.  I'm kidding.  I was showing a picture of her to tell you.  All right, let's get a song from Stephen Lynch.  Whatever you're feeling, Stephen.  I love all your songs.  I don't know.  I mean, I don't know whether they're doing the old stuff or the new stuff.  What really, really upsets people and aggravates them?  Kill a Kitten.  Play that one.  All right.  That's a great classic.  This is a classic.  One, two, three. 
[03:11:30]  When the game of life makes you feel like quitting  It helps a lot if you kill a kitten  Mark my words, cause from where I'm sitting  You can't go wrong if you kill a kitten  Tell me it's haunting, Anthony. 
[03:12:00]  Haunting.  Thank you.  Haunting ballad.  Ah, just like the old times.  There's no crime that you'll be committing  I know the law  You can kill a kitten  And if you need yarn  For that scarf you're knitting  You'll get plenty  When you kill a kitten 
[03:12:30]  Feed it turpentine  Or break its spine  Crush it with your shoe  As long as you  Kill a kitten  Meow  Can I get him?  All right, listen up  If the one you love  Isn't quite as smitten 
[03:13:00]  She'll like you better  When you kill a kitten  And I'll quote the Bible  Cause that's where it's written  If he loveth Jesus  He must kill a kitten  It's in the Bible too  I swear to God  Flush him down the can 
[03:13:30]  Hit him with your van  Drown him in a lake  Bake a cutie cake  Throw him at a train  Make him snort  Make him snort the cocaine  Stick some TNT  Up his cat booty  Do what you must do  As long as you  Kill a kitten  Kill a kitten 
[03:14:00]  Killing kittens  Killing kittens isn't easy  And if the thought makes you feel queasy  Grab a pitchfork from the shed  And kill a puppy dog  And kill a puppy dog instead  Kill a kitten  You gotta kill a kitten 
[03:14:30]  A little furry kitten  You gotta kill that kitten  Well, kill a little motherfucker  That's the motherfucker  Kill a little fucker  You gotta death  That's the motherfucker  8-6-7-5-3-0-9  8-6-7-5-3-0-9  Let's hear it for Stephen Light  You're still holding back a little bit though 
[03:15:00]  I noticed  He's not used to the satellite radio  You didn't commit to the motherfucker  You did not commit to the motherfucker  During that song  He'll be on another radio show  Doing it  Just cursing like crazy  I forgot  Hey, what?  You can't say that  That's awesome  Let's say hi to Adam from Jägermeister  Adam!  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Good, good  Tell us what we want to hear today  Come on  Jägermeister tap machine is on its way to you  Oh, nice  Paul is right with the world

Yep  I do all the Jägermeister sponsorships  Alright  And we're out here on the west coast  Getting ready for the Jägermeister tour  And we're going to come by  And offer you guys some tickets to the Jägermeister tour  It's 9.35 now  Right  How soon?  Yeah, when can it be here?  Yeah  Not in a few minutes  But it's definitely on its way  Alright  We're going to put you on hold  And Ben's going to talk to you 
[03:16:00]  Tears of joy streaming down Steve's face  Yeah, he really is going through DTs right now  Joe from Brooklyn  What's up?  You want it hooked up in that little room over there  Right by him  On an IV  Yeah  Hey, Joe, what's up?  How you doing?  Pretty good  Real fast  Come on  Oh, I said  Opie's the only guy I know  Who can kick ass underwater  And on rollerblades  Yeah, that's true  Yeah, if you line up Opie's footwear  When he's in fights  It would look pretty silly  You'd see like flippers  And rollerblades 
[03:16:30]  Clown shoes  I don't have time to tell that story again today  Moon boots  I did get in a fight underwater  60 feet underwater  With a Frenchman  That is as true as it gets though  Right out of a scene from Sea Hunt  Knife in his teeth  It really was  All right  I think we do another song actually  Oh  And then we'll take a break and play  What did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show  Like a music show today  Well, I don't know 
[03:17:00]  You know, Steven's a big star now  He hits the road  We might not see him for another two or three months  You never know  Or we might see him tomorrow  The Jaeger machine  Dude, if you want to come back tomorrow  By all means with Tyke  Do a couple duets tomorrow with Tyke  Maybe I will  You should, man  Sounds pretty good  I want to hear F your sister  But you can't do it by yourself  Only one break left?  No, not really  Oh, we could just go to the end?  We haven't even  We didn't do any breaks today  Yeah, we did a couple  Did we?  Yeah 
[03:17:30]  We just did one  Did we?  Okay  I've got amnesia  Yeah, I'm getting a little tired here  Alright, now what?  What are you looking at me for?  A song  Yeah, what do you want to hear, Anthony?  Hmm  Let me think  You know  I'm really good under pressure  Look at me go  That's alright  Take your time  No need to rush  It's only a live radio show  Yeah, a little dead air  We could do audience participation and do superhero in honor of Christopher Reeves 
[03:18:00]  Aww  That song could take 20 minutes now  Yeah, it does take 20 minutes  No, no, we'll do that another day  What happened?  How about something a little slower?  Down to the Old Pub Instead is kind of nice  That is a nice song  Or  I've got to be honest with you  I don't know that I'm prepared to sing that song  Okay  I haven't done it in so long  I don't think I'd run it  I don't have my little whistle for the musical interlude either  That's right, that's right  In the middle  I thought you meant by a little slower  Something like Special Ed  Ooh  Like slow like that 
[03:18:30]  Yeah, that's an oldie  That's a goodie  It's a nice number if you want to do that one  It's a nice ditty  It's expensive  Do you still do Special Olympics?  Uh, sometimes  If the occasion calls  Uh-huh  I'll do this one  When I was a boy of ten  I had a very special friend  Ed was kind  With good intents  But just a little different 
[03:19:00]  Oh, special Ed  His mama dropped him, dropped him on his head  Now he's not so bright instead  He's a little bit special  Just a little bit special  We'd play tag  And he'd get hurt  I'd play soldier 
[03:19:30]  I'd play soldier  He'd, he'd, he'd dirt  I like math and the spelling bee  Ed like talking to a tree  Oh, special Ed  His mama mama dropped him, dropped him on his head  Now she keeps him in the shed  Cause he's a little bit special  Cause he's a little bit special  Just a little bit special  I ran track 
[03:20:00]  Hung out in malls  Ed ran head first in two walls  I had girly girls  I had girly girls and lots of clothes  Ed had names for all his toes  Like Larry and Terry and Jerry and Barry and Ronnie and Ronnie and Bobby and Ricky and Mike  And if I love a girl who cares who you like  And special Ed  His mama mama dropped him, dropped him on his head 
[03:20:30]  Now he thinks he's a piece of bread  Cause he's a little bit special  Just a little bit special  I thought college life was great  Ed could count from one to two  I like people and the party scene  Ed was scared of the vacuum cleaner 
[03:21:00]  Special Ed  His mama mama dropped him, dropped him on his head  Now his favorite color is the radio  Cause he's a little bit  Just a little bit  One day talking to special Ed  He grabbed a brick  And he swung at my head 
[03:21:30]  And as he laughed at me  That's when I knew  That special Ed  Just made me special too  My shoes hurt  Now I laugh as I count bugs  I give strangers  I give strangers great big hugs  Next to me  It is fine  Yeah, he's a fucking Einstein 
[03:22:00]  Oh, special Ed and me  Now we're not right in the head  See, now we're not so, not so bright  Instead  We're a little bit special  Just a little bit special  That fucker Ed made me special  Just a little bit  Just a little bit special 
[03:22:30]  Just a little bit special  Don't laughing at me  Stop laughing at me  You stop laughing at me  And I'm Baked it all  Don't laughing at me  Holy Ed  That's a cliff I've never heard before 
[03:23:00]  Was that Julia Ann Lewis?  Why did you do that?  Why did you burn everyone loving me?  I'm sorry  I don't think anybody's loud.  Giovanni Ravisi.  Giovanni Ravisi, who plays the retarded character in every movie he's in.  Let's play Name the Retard.  I don't want to ever see you again.  Yeah, Steven. 
[03:23:30]  You're pissed off a lot of our listeners.  You're stupid.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  With that song.  I was like, oh.  Ma'am, I apologize.  Best movie ever.  Oh, The Other Sister.  That one's great.  Oh, man.  I like the other one where Giovanni Ravisi plays the retarded soldier.  What movie is that?  Oh, Saving Private Ryan.  Oh, the other one where he plays the retarded stock trader. 
[03:24:00]  Boiler Room.  Boiler Room.  Yeah, that was a good one, too.  He does play the same role.  Same retarded.  I'm a soldier.  I'm a medic.  You're a shot.  I will help you.  I'm sorry.  I don't make anybody loud.  All right.  Jesus.  Shut up.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't want to see you either.  I go poopy. 
[03:24:30]  All right.  Hey, Brendan, what's going on?  Yeah, what's going on, fellas?  Hey.  Jesus Christ.  You remember Columbine, whenever they said, how did those two guys meet?  Yes.  I think you guys.  I don't know how the hell they got four of the most offensive people in the world together  in the same room.  But God bless you guys.  You guys are excellent.  All right.  Thank you, mister.  See ya.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  XM 202.  Hi, Brian Kilmeade, sports guy, also co-host of Fox and Friends in the Morning on, you guessed 
[03:25:00]  it, the Fox News Channel.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Get the kids out of the car.  Stop them.  Leave them on the side of the road.  They'll be fine.  Listen to these guys.  There are a lot of good signs we have around the office.  People send in some really funny ones.  Oh, people send in.  Oh, Ben, that's a lot.  We got a great sign some listeners sent in.  It's hilarious.  It says Opie Anthony XM.  Right.  And above it, in big yellow letters, it says Shit Dick.  Yes. 
[03:25:30]  Because people listen to the program, they hear us, a program, they hear us talk about things.  They heard us play that song, Shit Dick, and then they send in signs.  That was a fine song on the Panzerfaust record label, Shit Dick.  It was a little song from Panzerfaust Records, Shit Dick.  1992.  Who wrote Shit Dick?  Now we got to play the song for all the new listeners.  Ed Norton.  Mrs. Manicotti walks in. 
[03:26:00]  Oh, Judas P. Shit Dick.  Little song, Panzerfaust Records, Shit Dick.  Oh, Mr. Kramden.  Oh, we're popping it in there.  There we are.  It's a fine number.  Of course it is.  Shit Dick.  Well, we got some gossip, but we should play the song for all the new listeners out there.  Can you get that shirt out of the way there, Hawk?  There we go.  So you can see Shit Dick when you're in the studio.  Oh, we're putting the signs back where they were? 
[03:26:30]  They should be up there.  Oh, that's where it was?  It was taken down.  It was taken down.  We'll explain in a second.  How would anyone take down?  We'll explain in a second, but for the new listeners, a lot of people just getting their  XM satellite radios for Christmas, they don't know what this song's about, so we should  just play it.  You're right, Hawk.  And then the sign was made, and then it caused a stir at the office after we left the air yesterday.  So, first, the song.  We hate all Shit Dick. 
[03:27:00]  We hate all Shit Dick.  Andy Warhol.  Shit Dick.  Mick Jagger.  Shit Dick.  Michael Jackson.  Shit Dick.  Jeffrey Dahmer.  Cannibal. 
[03:27:30]  Shit Dick.  We hate Shit Dick.  But Slammin' Shit Dick.  Boy George Shit Dick.  Freddie Mercury.  Shit Dick.  David Bowie.  Shit Dick.  Rob Halpert.  Inglis.  Do this.  Free.  Shit Dick.  Shit Dick. 
[03:28:00]  Shit Dick.  Rock Hudson.  Shit Dick.  Liberace.  Shit Dick.  Damn neighbor.  Shit Dick.  Robert Englund.  Freddie Kruger.  Fist Foxy.  Shit Dick.  Truman.  Capote.  Shit Dick.  Richard Simmons. 
[03:28:30]  Shit Dick.  Rock Stewart.  Shit Dick.  Richard Gere.  Butt.  Turbillin' Shit Dick.  We hate the Foxy Shit Dick.  Pahawky Shit Dick.  You're sick.  Sick.  Sick.  Rawr.  There you have it.  The song that started it all, Anthony, right?  Yeah, this was sent in by Panzerfaust Records, and it's an assortment of really bad racist 
[03:29:00]  and homophobic music, and, you know, we listen to these things, people send them in, we listen  to anything, and they're offensive, well, I'll fess up to that, very offensive, but there's  something about these Panzerfaust ones that are just catchy in a dopey way.  Makes you chuckle a little bit.  And you find yourself at home going, and you'll be singing that one. 
[03:29:30]  Jim Norton.  Shit Dick.  I don't like that version.  Under the porch.  Shit Dick.  I don't know.  That's not the lyrics.  If I act really, he's straight.  Shit Dick.  People that's serious.  Shit Dick.  So, then our listeners started making signs.  Yeah.  And one of them is the Shit Dick sign that is displayed over the window.  Uh-huh.  And some people, some people don't like it, Opie.  What?  Eh. 
[03:30:00]  Some people got a little annoyed from what I hear.  And basically, Anthony and I, you know, when 10 o'clock comes, we just leave.  I flee the studio.  We're pretty much calling it in these days.  We've done 10 years of radio together.  We just call it in.  I mean, let's be honest with each other.  Call it in.  You know, we are here about 5.15, so we'll show prep 45 minutes a day.  Tops.  Nah.  10 o'clock comes.  We can't be bothered.  We go right home, right?  Get me out of here.  But our fine staff stays sometimes until like 5 in the afternoon, right?  Wow.  All day, Anthony.  That's crazy.  All day to make us look good, because we really don't care at this point. 
[03:30:30]  They stay until my bedtime.  Right.  5 o'clock.  Fucking schedule.  Are you guys insane?  Time management.  All right.  Yeah, that's good.  All right, so they're working their asses off yesterday, and what happened?  I guess Eric was the first one, or Ben, that heard the commotion?  Hold on.  Hold on, Ben.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  It's Ben.  Oh.  There we go.  Hurricane Ben.  Look at him hurricane Derek to this song. 
[03:31:00]  It's Ben Ben.  Have a hurricane.  Yeah, no, I heard the door.  I was in the office.  I heard the door slam.  It sounded...  These doors are really heavy.  What doors?  The studio doors?  Yeah, they weigh about 500 pounds each.  These are soundproof, heavy doors.  I just heard...  I couldn't believe how loud it was, and I looked around.  By the way, it's impossible to slam that door.  Try it.  Someone try to slam this door.  You had to be so pissed to actually slam...  It was way louder than that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I heard it all the way across the hall.  It was loud.  Someone was pissed. 
[03:31:30]  Someone was pissed, and that's all you heard.  Yeah, I was on the computer.  I wasn't really...  But I then heard...  You were trying to get the latest gossip.  Yeah, of course you are.  What happened?  A door slamming in Boston.  So then Eric actually knows what happened, right?  So later on, one of the guys here at XM was doing an interview using our studio.  Now, why was he doing that?  I guess he got permission.  He got permission to use the Opie and Anthony studio.  It says the Opie and Anthony studio, basically.  This huge sign says Opie and Anthony. 
[03:32:00]  Now, there's two studios in here.  There's the Opie and Anthony studio, which is really huge and palatial.  Roomie.  And quite luxurious, Anthony.  You could really stretch out.  Look, we could have a big yawn, right, Ben?  Look at us.  Everyone can stretch at the same time.  Look.  Big through the hips.  Roomie.  Roomie.  Very roomie.  If this was a woman, it would be a size 14.  Right.  We're in a big, fat studio.  This is a large spice. 
[03:32:30]  And then there's the other studio.  Then there's the other closet.  Where all the people...  That used to use this big, huge studio.  Look at the size, size, size.  Giant.  They were kind of displaced and they were given that little thing over there.  They turned someone's office, which wasn't even really an office.  It was a desk and a phone.  It was a half of office.  Into a studio where they fit a console, monitors, TV, everything you would need for a studio in a closet. 
[03:33:00]  Right.  And that is what everyone else uses.  Right.  Because I believe people knew there would be some type of conflict if some of the people that worked here previously, to us being here, started using our studio.  Because we like it in a certain way.  And that certain way is hanging up some of our trophies of conquests in our pictures that we hang on the wall.  Some of the new girls that have been on the show.  Some of our videos and DVDs that we get from friends of the show. 
[03:33:30]  He spilt the chips.  Oh my God, the poker chips are falling out.  What, are you going to heave those at somebody?  No, no, no, no.  Yeah, then we have the famous poker chips, Anthony, that can be thrown at a guest at any given time.  Not very offensive, but then you look up top and there's various lubricants on the shelves.  Well, you've got the century sex video and the wiffle ball bat that's been used a few times.  And sure, all the KY and lubricants.  And then the montage of girls that have been naked on the show.  And the signs.  And the signs, right.  The signs.  Well, let's go from right to left. 
[03:34:00]  You've got Donkey Sausage, Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  Wool Connor, Opie and Anthony.  Lil.  Then you've got Where's Chester.  Where's Chester?  Opie and Anthony XM.  I mean, if you want to add to the signs, that would be wonderful.  And then this one over here that caused all the problems.  Shit dick.  In our studio.  This is like coming into our house when you enter that door over there.  What that sign is meant for is for assault on the media.  That's like our atomic bomb.  Yeah, that's like phase three. 
[03:34:30]  Yeah.  When it gets boring.  You know, eventually it'll get boring just to see our names and wow and XM on TV.  And we want to ruin it.  And then we'll start really upping the ante.  Yes.  Because if you're sitting there watching the news and all of a sudden you see shit dick pop up,  man, that is such a treat.  I guarantee if you're at home watching and you see shit dick pop up, shit dick Opie and Anthony,  you will laugh so hard you will have to go to the bathroom.  You might hemorrhage.  Yeah.  It's one of those things because you see it on TV and it's shocking.  Shock talk.  Shocking. 
[03:35:00]  It's shocking.  So you see it.  And that's what the sign is for.  Right.  But, you know, people that don't know the back story might see that and think, you know,  we're hateful.  But this is our playhouse.  This is our playhouse.  We have stuff in here.  Right.  And if someone wants to come in and use our studio because it's roomy and big enough to have guests in,  it's not our problem if they're offended by some of the stuff that goes on in here.  Well, who is using the studio?  The people from the Broadway channel. 
[03:35:30]  The Broadway channel.  The Broadway channel.  The people, Eric, or is it?  How many people?  The gentleman who runs the Broadway channel.  Oh, gentleman.  And he's not used to shit dick?  Well, we don't know.  We don't know, Rich.  We don't know.  I don't think he, uh...  Please, how about Nathan Lane's shit dick?  All right, Nathan Lane. 
[03:36:00]  Let's relax, okay?  I can't imagine why somebody from a Broadway who runs a Broadway channel would be offended by shit dick.  I don't either.  I cannot imagine why.  I don't know.  All right, so what happened?  So they come in.  They set up.  Now, who were they interviewing?  I don't know who the lady is, but she had to be pushing 50, so she's well-established in Broadway.  Yeah.  I hear she's a very famous Broadway actress.  Oh, really?  If you were in the Broadway circle, you would know who she was. 
[03:36:30]  Right.  If you're not, you could care less about this ageing meat bag.  Exactly.  So they come in, um...  What was her name?  Mario Cantone?  Mario Cantone!  Shit dick!  I hate to say this, Cartman.  Shit dick.  Mario Cantone.  Can't do the impression, obviously.  So anyway, they come in, and they're setting up, and the engineer that they're using makes sure that our settings are fine.  They redo it so they can do their interview. 
[03:37:00]  They do the interview.  Yeah.  About 25 minutes.  Interview goes by.  All done.  The actress gets up with her publicist and leaves.  The Broadway guy's here, and somebody who's...  I think he might be the head of the New York Theatre's Guild.  Mr. Favisham?  Putting on the Lodge show, I believe.  The Broadway guy is sitting where Rich is, and the New York Theatre Guild guy is sitting right here on the lesbian couch.  Oh, boy.  Only he knew. 
[03:37:30]  They're talking with the person who...  Closes it, gets a vagina.  They're talking with the person who was engineering the show, and I see the Broadway guy's face just getting all mad.  Uh-oh.  So we're in the producer's studio doing some work, so we turn it on, pot it up, so we can hear what's going on.  Oh!  I wish you taped it.  We tried to, but they would have known we were taping it.  We tried to.  We really did.  Wow.  He's all upset, starts complaining to the engineer, saying, you know, doesn't XM have some kind of line of decency that this stuff isn't appropriate in the workplace? 
[03:38:00]  No, they don't.  Oh, in the workplace.  In the workplace.  In the workplace.  This isn't a workplace.  We get to just screw off.  That's our jobs.  This isn't work.  This isn't an office that you go to work in.  Stop confusing radio with a workplace.  Well, it is.  No, no.  That's the people that do confuse it only get to a certain level and wonder why nobody knows their name or cares about them.  That's why, stupid.  Believe it or not, this is a place like an artist's studio. 
[03:38:30]  It's not an office.  This is where you come in and create.  We're artists.  And make things unfettered by stupid office regulations like you want to smear all over the place.  Anyone that says workplace, my opinion is that's the type of jizz bucket that will throw that word around to scare the boss.  I don't like that type of harassment in the workplace.  Workplace.  Because it instantly conjures up the harassment things and people getting in trouble. 
[03:39:00]  I can't wait to get rid of those cubicles.  Yeah.  It can't happen soon enough.  When is the bulldozer coming in?  We should have a party.  Just get a sledgehammer.  Because it does look like a workplace because all these offices, all these boars that have been hanging out in this office for the last few years have made it into a boring workplace.  They try to be individuals by hanging little things up in the cubicle, but it's still a cubicle.  Plackards.  So what happened, Eric?  We need a tsunami to sweep through here and just wash it out a window.  So like I said, I see the guy getting mad, so we pot it up and we're listening. 
[03:39:30]  And he's talking about, doesn't XM have some kind of line of decency that everyone has to follow in the workplace?  And while he's saying that, he leans over, and that sign was on the floor at the time.  The shit dick sign.  Picks up the shit dick sign, and he starts waving it in his left hand, right?  And he's like, I mean, look at this.  Shit dick.  You know what he said in a deep voice?  He grabbed a camera and snapped a picture of him holding that sign up.  We had to put it up on the website.  He was mad because it wasn't a real dick in his hand.  Oh, Voss, that's not funny. 
[03:40:00]  Shut up, those Broadway faggots.  Let me tell you something about this.  If you want to sue anyone, his name is Rich Voss.  Rich Voss.  I try hitting dump buttons around here.  We have no idea if this guy is what this guy does.  I try hitting dump buttons.  I don't know if they work or not around here.  I don't know.  I didn't say any guy's name, but, you know, they're a bunch of liberals that get so mad at  everything, you know?  They're just a bunch of babies.  I can't say this, say that.  The goddamn, you know what?  You know, if Janine Garofalo was in here saying that shit, they wouldn't have a problem.  Why?  Am I in trouble or something?  No, go.  No, I just, I just, you know, forget it. 
[03:40:30]  Just liberals.  Dude, I don't, look, I personally, I can't see why anyone who runs a Broadway channel would  be offended by the term shit dick.  I don't know why that would bother them or affect them at all.  It has nothing to do with them.  What?  No.  What?  What?  Shut up, you coward.  Jesus, will you be a man for one?  Stop going.  He's looking around.  Is he here?  Shut up.  You get all scared like the guy might be here.  No, I thought it was like an attempt.  What's he going to do, running and sing at you?  Shut your mouth.  I didn't appreciate that.  Get back in the closet studio. 
[03:41:00]  That is a closet studio, as it should be.  Voss, Voss, stupid Voss.  Fuck off, Voss.  He's going to come in and sing and dance at his face.  The Jets versus the shit dicks.  I don't want to offend anybody's sense of decency, so you know what may have to happen? 
[03:41:30]  Yeah.  No longer permitted in the studio.  We don't want to upset anybody.  Yes, that might have to be the rule.  He entered our atmosphere here.  Of course, nobody's waving it around.  That sign is up in the top corner.  You don't have to look at it.  Right.  Get a hold of yourself.  But this is part of the workplace.  Ah, the workplace.  So we need to, you know, get rid of anything.  And I heard that there was some offense taken at the nude woman picture.  So the guy's holding the sign and waving it to the engineer, and he goes, I mean, come  on, shit, dick, what is this?  And then he throws the sign down, right? 
[03:42:00]  The theater guild guy sitting right here, and he goes, this, he's like, we walked in  here, and I didn't notice until about a couple minutes we're doing the interview that all  this indecency is in here.  I mean, if I would have known, and he points to the hot naked pictures.  The wonderful wall of hot girls.  Beautiful girls.  Girls.  Right.  And the last one is one of the girls that were in the studio here.  Young, nude, on all fours, on a bed.  Yeah, that's the girl that took...  Giving a sexy little look.  That's the girl that took three fingers, Anthony.  Right.  Yep. 
[03:42:30]  And there is nothing offensive about that photo.  Nope, she's just...  It is a beautiful photo.  Beautiful.  She's got the...  In the Opie and Anthony studio.  Yeah.  Three fingers.  I got her beat me, too.  It's very surprising that somebody else from Broadway would be offended...  Yeah.  ...by the naked girls.  And it's amazing.  These are probably the same people that would scream if you complained about Robert Mapplethorpe's work.  These are probably the same people that would fight for his right to freedom of expression. 
[03:43:00]  Right.  Because you're a homophobe if you find Mapplethorpe repugnant when it's a bunch of naked girls.  Well, now it's a problem in...  Here's our favorite term.  The workplace.  The workplace.  This is where we create.  Yes.  We come in on a daily basis and talk and get ideas and a lot of that is based on our environment.  We can't sit at those cubicles and start talking back and forth and do the show that we do in here because the atmosphere just isn't conducive to this type of show. 
[03:43:30]  We come in.  We like the atmosphere.  It's comfortable.  I think you could tell even the first few shows before we really got comfortable in here, it's a little off.  You know what I mean?  Sure.  And then as time goes by and we add and personalize the studio more, it becomes more familiar and friendly and more us.  And we're able to create better.  It's called a studio because artists work in a studio.  Right.  So go back to your cubicle because that's where you belong.  Yeah.  You are an office dullard and you consider this a workplace, so go back to the cubicle. 
[03:44:00]  Yeah.  And whatever it is you do in the cubicle is your business.  If you want to go to your closet and conduct an interview, that's what you should do.  Fine.  The little closet office, you should get back in that closet and just begin interviewing people.  That's where you should do your interviews.  Exactly.  There is a little closet with a little bit of microphones.  That's where you can do all your interviews.  That's it.  You know?  Absolutely.  But don't come in here.  Do you think at Broadway, like when they're rehearsing for shows, do you think there's little things up on the walls and in the dressing rooms? 
[03:44:30]  Do you think maybe there's a picture of, I don't know, some guy with tight abs?  Yeah.  Baryshnikov.  Muscles.  Baryshnikov or something.  Yeah.  Well, we'll give up.  Maybe.  That inspires them.  Sure.  A pair of tights that show off his mule and his bag and his veins.  You don't hear any complaints about that, I'll bet.  Are you talking about Ben?  Or, oh, I thought you were talking about our own Ben Sparks for a moment.  I can't imagine why they'd be offended.  So what else, Eric? 
[03:45:00]  That was about it?  Didn't they talk to Bruce, the guy that runs the New York office?  That's where this is leading.  So the theater guy, the theater guild guy, is pointing to the pictures of the girls.  Yeah.  He goes, I mean, look at this.  Next time, this all has to be taken down.  It's like, we have to get rid of all of this.  Oh, really?  Next time.  Right?  So, like Bruce said, came in and Bruce goes, oh, wait a minute.  Whether you like it or not, these guys run this place.  And until I'm told different, you do not touch anything, you leave it here, and this is their studio.  And Bruce said, oh, we'll just find some other place for you to record. 
[03:45:30]  Very good.  See, Bruce knows.  Bruce is a huge fan of the show.  Bruce is the man.  He is the man.  Well, he knows we're not going around, I mean, and telling any, as much as we bust balls or whatever,  we're not telling anybody else in the office, like, we're not pretending we're offended at anything they do  or trying to get them to change the way they run business at all.  I would never go into that other studio and care what they're doing.  Ever.  If they were in this studio, I would never care what they were doing.  And if you had to use that studio for something, you'd go in there, use it, and would it matter what was there? 
[03:46:00]  None of my business.  Right.  None of your business.  And it's not the guy, it's not the Frank's Place guy that we're talking about.  I actually, I like him.  I see him a lot.  We say hello now.  He's conformed.  Yeah.  Well, a little awkwardness at the beginning, and now we're all finding a way to coexist.  Yeah, we don't mind the Oompa Loopa anymore.  Ah, we like him.  There's the Oompa Loopa update.  We don't mind him anymore.  I nod at him now.  Again.  I'm almost to the point where I'm going to actually say hi.  I nod, though.  We are arrogant dickheads.  No, we're not.  And in fairness, we really are.  We came in here, and look, here was the attitude.  Hello, little man. 
[03:46:30]  Beat it.  Take your sign down and tell your story walking.  We were kind of dickheads about it.  I'll acknowledge that.  I certainly was.  Sure.  Walking around the office talking to Bruce.  I can't wait to get these shitty cubicles out of here so bands can come in and play.  Sorry, I know you've been working and sweating here.  So, all right, I can see why some people wouldn't like us.  All right.  You walked around all cocksure.  Speaking of...  Cock of the walk, Ant.  Cock of the walk.  Although I'm sure that wouldn't offend certain people.  Just speculating.  I don't have anybody in mind, of course.
