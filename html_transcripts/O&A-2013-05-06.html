<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with lighthearted banter about the Kentucky Derby, focusing on the jockeys' small size and the horses' behavior.  Opie detailed his online horse racing experiences using Twinspires.com, including his setup, wins, losses (ending down $260), and the thrill of betting from home on international races. The conversation shifted to the NHL playoffs, specifically the Islanders' loss to the Penguins, and Opie's reluctance to tweet about the game. They also discussed a car-smashing tailgate event and a Canadiens hockey brawl, comparing fighting in different sports.  A lengthy discussion followed about Opie's son's birthday party and the anxieties surrounding costume choices (dragon, pirate, princess), prompting a conversation about perceiving someone's sexual orientation. A caller, Vic, shared a similar experience. The segment concluded with further discussions of birthday parties, the challenges of parenting in a small NYC apartment, and disposing of children's toys, with a brief mention of "Life of Pi."

The show then moved to a discussion of *Life of Pi*, its allegorical interpretations, and a debate on whether the events depicted actually occurred. This transitioned into a discussion of latex allergies (Anthony claiming an allergy to latex condoms), childhood illnesses, and a humorous tangent about helium shortages and the Hindenburg disaster.  Amy's interpretation of *Life of Pi* as a religious metaphor was revisited, and the hosts shared anecdotes about movies that made them cry, including one about an unintentionally funny reaction to pornography.

Doug Stanhope was announced as a guest, and the fourth anniversary of Tippi Tom's death was commemorated with the playing of his audio clips.  A short, nonsensical bit with E-Rock and Francine followed.  The show then discussed various musical artists (Elton John, Bob Seger, the Rolling Stones), including a debate on Elton John lyrics, Bob Seger's enduring popularity, and the Rolling Stones' ticket sales struggles.  A caller recounted issues with satellite radio, leading to a discussion about its challenges.  Opie shared a story about teenage heartbreak, segueing into a discussion of the Boston Marathon bomber's burial, with the hosts expressing their strong opinions and dismissing the idea of a traditional Muslim burial.

The segment on the Boston Marathon bomber continued, with disgust expressed over a supposed city manager proposal to dump the body in a sewer.  They also reacted negatively to a video of Syrians celebrating destruction caused by Israeli missiles, labeling it "lunacy," leading to a broader discussion of global conflict. A humorous segment followed, involving a hypothetical grocery delivery person's "kryptonite" (a weak paper bag), transitioning to a discussion of upcoming guests (Doug Stanhope, the impact of Dr. Drew leaving Celebrity Rehab, and "Tan Mom"'s pop song release).  3D-printed guns were also discussed.  More of Tippy Tom's sexually explicit and vulgar calls were played, detailing his promiscuity and soliciting sex for alcohol.

Doug Stanhope, wearing a 70s leisure suit, joined the show, and the conversation returned to the Boston Marathon bomber, with Stanhope proposing to bury him in his father's unused cemetery plot in Paxton, Massachusetts, despite potential objections.  This led to a discussion of cemetery authority and handling the remains of perpetrators.  A lengthy discussion followed about Stanhope's sobriety, Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), and Dr. Drew's Celebrity Rehab.  Stanhope questioned AA's effectiveness and manipulative aspects, contrasting it with his approach. He shared anecdotes about substance use (Ambien, Xanax, etc.), its effects on his comedy and life, and compared his experiences to other comedians, notably Mitch Hedberg.  The discussion continued about the bomber's burial and Stanhope's plans.

The final segment focused on the 12 steps of AA, specifically the role of belief in a higher power, with a debate on whether belief in God is necessary. Alternative interpretations were offered, including using the group or oneself as a higher power.  The conversation branched into tangents about the hypocrisy of religious figures, Scientology (comparing its confession methods to Christianity), drunk driving (including a humorous proposed experiment), and Doug Stanhope's mother's suicide from a morphine overdose.  Stanhope provided a detailed, often darkly humorous account of the events leading up to, during, and after her death.  The hosts speculated on why many comedians seem to have addictive personalities, and discussed Phil Hendry's unique radio show/podcast.  Doug Stanhope remained as a guest throughout this segment.  Vulgar language and potentially offensive topics were prevalent throughout the entire broadcast.

[00:03:00]  O.P. and Anthony show starts now.  O.P. and Anthony show starts now.  O.P. and Anthony show starts now.  O.P.  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans. 
[00:03:30]  At the controls, Reg Hughes, the father.  Oh, this is perfect. This is how it should be.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Hey, hi.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  It's me! I work here!  Glad I got that one out.  Are we on live now? Is it happening? This is it.  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony show,  a popular radio program known for its cream style of entertainment and having very few limits.  I like where this is going. I'm seeing a lot of options here. 
[00:04:00]  This is different than any other radio.  No telling what we're going to hear in here today.  Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's not like radio stuck hanging out.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  This is why. This is American freedom of speech.  It's good on every level.  And sane.  Every second is funny.  Wildly funny.  And philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people. Real excitement.  This is the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:04:30]  Oh, man.  I'm an airplane.  I like that.  There you go.  Hi.  Good morning, everyone.  How are you?  And isn't it a fine morning?  It's a beautiful morning.  Where the fuck is spring?  Yeah, again, it was a little chilly out. 
[00:05:00]  I went on my bike yesterday afternoon and I was freezing my ass off.  Yeah.  My fucking hands are freezing.  Took a quick loop in Central Park late in the afternoon.  It's fucking weird.  It's into May.  Come on, fuckers.  It was cold.  Yeah.  We were just talking about the Kentucky Derby.  Yeah.  The Derby.  I don't know.  We're just not mature.  They're looking at the jockeys like they're athletes. 
[00:05:30]  And they marched them out.  And I just started laughing.  I felt like I was watching The Wizard of Oz.  They're just little fellas getting ready to jump on those big, big ass horses.  They are just the tiniest little guys.  They're just little fellas.  And you kind of look at them on the horse and you don't really, I don't know, you don't  really think.  You're just like, oh, it's a jockey.  Right.  But when they're off that horse and they were marching them from, I guess, their locker room  through the crowd.  Through the crowd.  And you could see them next to real people. 
[00:06:00]  I was, I started laughing.  I was too.  How do you not laugh at that?  It's so small.  But supposedly they're great athletes.  I don't know.  What the fuck?  I interviewed all of them for The Tonight Show a couple years ago.  Oh, that's right.  Oh, yes.  They're tiny.  Right?  Tiny little guys.  And they're all, they weigh, they are like down to the ounce about how much they weigh.  Yeah.  It's very rigorous training to make sure they're not overweight.  It's like every ounce counts.  Yeah.  They have to know exactly how much they are when they put them on the horse. 
[00:06:30]  And, you know, they take them so seriously.  But a few of these horses, as they were trying to get them into the gates for the race itself  or, you know, close to getting them into the gates, they're just sniffing other horses  asses.  Oh, yeah.  They're looking to just get some fucking ass.  A champ.  A true champion.  They're trying to get a true champion.  Yeah.  Just sniffing ass.  And again, it's an animal that just wants to fuck.  But we make it like it's way more than that.  Oh, yeah.  The majesty of, oh, look at him. 
[00:07:00]  You think they throw a horse in there for the winter?  Someone already.  Yeah, we're watching this.  Is it wet that grounds?  Yeah.  Oh, it was a rainy race, man.  It was one of those muddy, rainy races where they had to keep throwing their goggles off.  Oh, they had different pairs of goggles, right?  I think they have like, I want to say eight pairs.  Yeah, they were burning a shit load.  And they just keep flipping them, flipping them, flipping them.  Yeah.  But if...  What if a horse steps on it?  No, they're not allowed to...  You can't lose any of your equipment, I believe.  They pull it down around their neck. 
[00:07:30]  No, they pull them up?  Do they pull them up?  Oh, shit.  I thought they were pulling them down around their neck.  Yeah?  $100?  I don't know.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure either.  But they have to stay on their person.  If they lose any of their equipment, then they're disqualified.  I believe.  Wow.  That sucks.  I feel afraid the horse will slip.  Well, yeah.  Yeah, that's happened.  It's not the greatest conditions to have a race, but...  Fucking Verrazano.  That 14 horse fucked me.  A lot of people went with Verrazano, right? 
[00:08:00]  I know.  Just because it was a local thing.  Well, that and, you know...  We got a bridge named Verrazano, for the people I don't know, in the New York area.  Verrazano.  I don't know.  They say it's exciting and all.  The build-up is way too fucking long.  Oh, my God.  It's fucking hours for less than two minutes.  Two-minute race.  All those people have to just hang out for a few hours.  I guess it's a good party, though, right?  I guess if you're there, it is.  You know, the stupid hats. 
[00:08:30]  They make a big deal about the hats.  What about the hat?  The hat.  But they make a big deal about the hats.  Yeah.  And all the news segments.  It's like, and let's go to blah, blah, Churchill Downs.  And she's like, do you like my hat?  Of course I don't like your hat.  It's like a hacky hat thing.  And they all look like those stupid fucking big, overgrown, oldie-style hats.  They're kind of like Easter bonnets, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Sort of.  That little stupid thing. 
[00:09:00]  I guess it was exciting.  I don't know.  I've never gotten into horse racing.  I'll watch the three big races every year, but that's about it.  I'll watch the Belmont.  Yeah, you'll watch the big races.  The Kentucky Derby and the Preakness, right?  Those are the three.  Yep.  For the Triple Crown.  But, I don't know.  Whatever.  Did you bet?  Well, yes, I did.  Bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet.  Yes, I did indeed.  See, I didn't want to go out and look for an OTB. 
[00:09:30]  OTBs are, I don't know, it's so old school.  It's 2013.  And OTBs are just fucking, you know, a bunch of degenerates.  You know, it takes forever.  You stand it online.  Yeah, but it's kind of cool.  Yeah.  I like hanging with the degenerates.  Oh, I don't know.  As long as I have a camera.  I don't know.  OTBs.  And then just trying to find one now is...  Almost impossible.  Yeah.  There's a few that are actually in bars.  OTBs?  You go into a bar and there's a little OTB kiosk.  Oh, that's kind of cool.  In like a bar. 
[00:10:00]  So, I decided I was going to go online and be like, betting Kentucky Derby from home.  So, I'm like, oh, look at this.  It's a site.  I think it was Twinspires.  Twinspires.com.  Named after the Twinspires of Churchill Downs, I would assume.  So, I go there and it's like, oh, well, you sign up, you get yourself a little account  and then you go off to like a Dwayne Reed or one of those fucking pharmacies and you 
[00:10:30]  pick yourself up a cash card thing there and then you load up your account and from home  you're just betting the Kentucky Derby.  Wait, why do you have to get a cash card if it's online?  Well, to fund your account, you can't really do it with a credit card.  So, you get money on a card at Dwayne Reed and then you punch that card number?  Yeah, and then you punch the little code number into your account.  Why don't they want to deal with credit cards?  It transfers the money. 
[00:11:00]  Credit card companies don't like dealing with it, with gambling sites and stuff.  So, this is the workaround?  Yeah, the workaround.  So, I went to the pharmacy.  Wait, what kind of card do you get at the pharmacy?  It's called a money pack.  Oh, okay.  A Greenpoint, is it?  Money pack?  Okay.  So, I got one of those.  I load it up with like 500 bucks.  Nice.  I go home.  I put 500 into the account.  Nice.  And now I'm running fucking race book from my home.  You got the sting operation.  Yeah, it was great. 
[00:11:30]  I had the giant fucking 90 inch with all the stats and the races being live on there.  I saw your tweet.  Yeah.  It looked very impressive.  And then I got my fucking, my iPad with all the stats on it.  Nice.  And I got my computer with the fucking actual interface to make the bets.  So, I'm rolling.  You actually look at the stats, though?  Well, yeah.  I just kind of...  Yeah, that's a good name.  Yeah, I picked one here and one there.  Oh, believe me, I'm not fucking, you know, handicapping these things.  All of a sudden, 701 looks pretty good to me for whatever dumb reason. 
[00:12:00]  But here's the thing.  Yeah.  Here's where they get you.  Uh-oh.  Well, it's not really get you.  It's where you can get yourself.  So, I'm like, oh, Kentucky Derby.  That's good.  Let me, you know, so I get on.  I'm going to bet the Derby.  And it says, oh, track.  I'm like, well, it's twinspires.com.  I assume the track is Churchill Downs.  I look.  I click.  Oh, there's a fuckload of tracks at all hours, all over the world.  You could bet any track ever. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, shit.  So, now I'm like, woo-hoo.  Oh, shit.  Let me put some on the third in Belmont.  So, you're not even just doing Kentucky Derby shit anymore.  No.  Oh, wow.  So, I was just.  Oh, that's dangerous.  So, I'm betting.  I'm sitting on my couch betting the horses.  From all over the world?  Anywhere you want.  And what?  They'll tell you what the next race is around the world?  Oh, yeah.  Can you see the actual race?  Yeah.  No. 
[00:13:00]  Yes.  You go on.  Even some obscure race in, I don't know.  Yes.  Dubai.  They're all televised.  Oh, that's pretty cool.  So, you go to the tracks, the individual track off of Twinspires.  You bet it.  And then you hit live video.  And the video comes up.  And I was doing that.  And then I was just putting it on my fucking TV.  So, I'm watching the races and watching all the stats and stuff.  Were you by yourself?  And my bets?  Let me think.  Yes.  It was Sunday. 
[00:13:30]  It was great.  I was fucking.  I was moving and shaking.  It was so.  Just by yourself.  Fucking betting horses.  It was thrilling.  I'd hear like.  I'm like.  Here it is.  It's not a bad hobby, though.  It's not addictive.  It's not a bad hobby, though.  Post time in six minutes.  Post time in six minutes.  I'm like.  Oh, I got to get my bets in.  And there I am.  Tinkering at the computer.  All right. 
[00:14:00]  What should I do?  Fucking $10.  Exact a box.  Seven.  Five.  All right.  I got that.  Maybe.  Maybe a triple.  Two.  Throw the two in.  Okay.  Good.  Good.  The two.  So, derby day was fun.  You were tweeting.  Wait.  Did you start before derby day?  Well, yeah.  I was doing all the preliminary races at Churchill Downs before the derby.  Right.  The derby is the 11th race.  So, there are 10 good races to bet. 
[00:14:30]  So, did you delete all this from your laptops?  Nah.  Or now you're in for a while?  Nah.  I didn't delete it.  Why not?  I still got some money left in the account.  Did you win anything?  Yeah.  Actually, I didn't.  I won the first race I bet on at Churchill Downs.  Not much.  But then I was playing Belmont at the same time.  And I won like $270 on an exact day at Belmont.  And then the very next race I won $350.  So, my account was like really pretty good. 
[00:15:00]  But then Sunday is not derby day.  It's just any other day.  So, I pulled up Belmont.  Oh, boy.  And I decided I'm just going to play some horses here.  And my amounted to about, I had $500 to start with.  I got it up to about $6 and change.  And now I'm down $160.  Oh, you're down $160?  No, I'm down $260 in my account.  You've lost $340.  So, yeah.  Gotcha.  Yeah. 
[00:15:30]  But it's fun, you know.  You just kind of, if you're just sitting around the house, you don't got to sit there the whole time.  You wait until you hear the little da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  And then you fucking, there it is.  Oh, look.  I'm getting all like excited.  What, your TV tells you?  Yeah.  So, you can be wandering around and then you hear that noise and it's time to get in front of the TV?  You got to run, place your bet real quick, and then they're off.  Nice.  I never know which is where.  I lose track.  If I'm looking at one, I lose track two seconds into the race. 
[00:16:00]  I'm like, I don't know where my guy is.  It's very hard to keep track like that.  But they have some pretty cool graphics now on the bottom of the screen.  They got the little round circles with the colors and the numbers in them.  And they arrange them on the bottom of the screen, like in the order they're in on the track.  Don't they do the NASCAR thing, too?  Yeah, and they kind of do that, too.  Where they have the pointy, pointy thing above the cars or the horses?  For the big races.  They didn't have that for the Kentucky Derby.  No, they didn't.  I noticed.  They kind of put at the bottom of the screen what horses win, place, and show. 
[00:16:30]  I've never gotten into horse racing.  Yeah, me neither.  I've gone a few times.  It's kind of fun to be there.  Being there is good.  And then just degenerate betting from home is pretty fucking good.  That's a long shot.  That's what I did when I was there.  I took a long shot for like 20 bucks.  Like whatever the craziest odds were, I took them.  Because you bet 20 or 50 bucks and if you win, you win 1,000.  Right.  Of course, I didn't win.  My guy came in fucking, I think, 39th place.  Yeah.  I don't like the win, play, show bets.  I like doing the multiple horses, exactors. 
[00:17:00]  Things like that.  He's like that.  So go now past the wire.  Past the wire.  It's Kentucky Derby.  It's Kentucky Derby.  Verizano is in fourth.  Vijak is in fifth.  And Verizano.  It's my lucky day is in sixth.  Falling Sky in seventh.  I had all the horses for the triple.  Actually, the Superfecta pick four thing.  I had three of the four horses in there. 
[00:17:30]  And I had stupid Verizano instead of the four horse.  And that paid like $28,000.  I was like, oh, damn it.  Wow.  Couldn't get that.  So close.  Oh, so close.  And then another one I lost out by like fucking neck.  At the last minute, the horse came and just passed the horse I needed.  And yeah.  Fucked you up.  But I'm like, you know, when you're sitting on your couch at home, watching it on your television,  leaning forward on the couch going, come on, come on, come on. 
[00:18:00]  Were you really?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You got it.  You got to get into it, you know.  That's the shit you got to film, man.  I'm like, fuck it.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  I saw the one Vine video.  Yeah, yeah.  A little Vine video.  But yeah, before you know it, I'll just have a cigar and I'll rolled up fucking race form.  Smacking it on my leg.  Ah, you son of a bitch.  Yeah.  It was fun.  It sounds like a good weekend.  It was good.  But then, you know, yeah, everyone's like, oh, you got to look out.  But by, like, the, I guess by the fifth race at Belmont yesterday, I just, I was like, eh, fuck this. 
[00:18:30]  I just shut the computer and fucking finally had it.  Yeah.  It was enough.  Oh, there's the graphic at the bottom.  Yeah.  I'm amazed by the announcers on these things.  It's an amazing talent.  All wins the Derby.  All wins the Derby.  Yeah.  But remember years ago in the 60s, 70s, they had to do it with binoculars.  Yes.  Like, now at least it's computer graphics.  You have TV monitors. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, yeah.  But fuck, man.  Years ago, this guy had binoculars.  And it looks like number seven.  He has to remember who number seven is because he can't keep looking.  And it's, oh, fuck, position has changed.  He can't keep looking down.  I remember a Bugs Bunny cartoon where they had the guy up in a booth way high up in the stands.  And he had, like, the press hat on and the binoculars.  And he was like, yeah.  And he got so built up, he's hanging out the window on the front of the thing.  And he's holding the binoculars.  It just looks like.  Let's find that.  It looked so manic.  It was great.  Bugs Bunny horse racing. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  I'm totally amazed by this.  Because you have to learn each race in that moment.  Each race.  Every horse.  There's fucking so many horses.  And the jockeys that are on the horse.  It is an amazing thing.  And it's going so fast, you know.  But they only need to worry about four or five for most of the race.  You know what I mean?  It's not like they're changing a lot of positions.  But still, they have to know what number seven is.  It's so impressive, of course.  Oh, it was the greyhound.  A racer, wasn't it?  That I gotta see.  Hmm.  A programming. 
[00:20:00]  A programming.  Make it bigger, Sam.  Double it.  I don't know any of these dogs.  I'll go and give them the once over.  Bugs is crazy.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Looks a little undernourished.  Kind of in-escan the alley bay.  This one looks a little better.  Kind of flabby, though.  The dogs aren't even moving?  No.  Hmm.  This one ain't got a chance.  Hmm.  Number seven.  That's me lucky number.  Hmm.  Looks pretty good.  Better check his teeth, though. 
[00:20:30]  Come on, Lassie.  Open your mouth.  Lassie.  I see those little toothies.  Hmm.  A little shadow on that bicuspidor.  You better see your dentist.  Rabbit.  Neee, what's up, Doc?  Don't you like rabbits?  No.  I'm a retard.  What a performance.  Hey, this kid's gonna leave his race down that hole.  Ooh.  The next race is about to start, ladies and gentlemen.  I don't want to miss this.  And they use a little rabbit.  I think this one... 
[00:21:00]  Doesn't Bugs fall in love with the rabbit on the rails?  Yeah, I think so.  No, bunion looks a little sore.  No, whatever.  Keep going.  Nomadic tire looks a little flat.  Father's mustache is a little droopy.  You remember this shit.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He's all horny for the fake rabbit.  Oh, yeah.  The fake rabbit rabbit.  He's all horny for the fake rabbit.  Wow.  What a hunk of feminine poultry to them. 
[00:21:30]  He's all horned dog now.  The dogs are going wild.  Oh, dogs, right.  And there they go.  What?  Dogs chasing that cute little bunny?  They can't do this.  Chivalry is not dead.  I'll see.  All right.  It's a classic.  Yeah, it keeps going.  Yeah, it's on YouTube.  Go have fun.  Oh.  Yeah, so that was the Kentucky Derby weekend.  Were you watching any of the playoff hockey?  No, I wasn't getting into it. 
[00:22:00]  I did here.  I kept tabs on Twitter.  And oh, boy.  What happened there, huh?  Fucking Islanders almost pulled it out yesterday.  Wow.  It's an overtime.  Fucking penalty called an overtime.  A penalty in overtime must be pretty blatant.  It wasn't, though.  No?  It was a penalty they usually don't call in overtime.  But I'm not going to be one of those guys that bitch.  It happens fucking for both fucking teams. 
[00:22:30]  Playoff hockey, overtime, a penalty, it better be fucking.  They usually let them play in overtime.  That's crazy.  So the Islanders lost an OT.  The fucking Penguins had a power play.  I noticed.  I saw your tweet.  I was trying to keep my mouth shut, too.  Oh, boy.  Everybody was wondering.  And then one guy.  Everyone tweets me when the Islanders are playing, especially in the playoffs.  So you're watching this game.  And I'm sitting there like, of course I'm watching this game.  But I don't want to fucking tweet anything.  Well, one guy tweeted you.  And it was like, hey, Ope, you know, Islanders playoff. 
[00:23:00]  It's another close one.  It's classic.  They're in overtime.  No tweet.  You're not watching.  And all Opey wrote was, what did you write?  It was like.  Something like I'm keeping my mouth shut.  I'm keeping my mouth shut.  Something like that.  It's like I'm keeping my mouth shut.  Within minutes.  Within minutes.  They lost in overtime.  Within minutes.  It's uncanny.  They lost.  And I was just like, oh, my God.  Why did you say anything?  You were Twitter dark. 
[00:23:30]  I thought I wasn't saying anything by saying that.  Yeah, yeah.  I couldn't help myself.  I was watching the game.  And everyone's trying to get me in a little Twitter conversation.  I'm like, I'm not doing it.  Can I just watch the game?  I'm reading my Twitter feed a little bit.  I just wrote.  What was it again?  I wrote.  That's the turning point.  There was the turning point.  You find it.  Whatever.  What's the score of the series?  It's what are we up to?  2-1.  2-1, yeah.  2-1 Penguins.  Penguins are a tough fucking team. 
[00:24:00]  But the Islanders have been playing well of late.  So they're giving them a good fight so far.  We'll see.  They really needed that game yesterday.  We need to win two out of three at home.  So now we've got to win the next two.  Our pal Ralph Macchio was tailgating.  Tailgating?  Tailgating at Uniondale.  That's a rough tailgate.  That's a rough tailgate.  No, actually, they have a pretty good time in the parking lot.  Yeah.  Did you see they were sledgehammering the car? 
[00:24:30]  But everything has to be PC now?  Yeah.  To get everyone motivated for the big game, they had a car with all the Penguins' numbers  on it, and you got a sledgehammer, that old gag.  You know, kind of like the Bronco thing we did.  Yeah, we did that.  But they can't even, like...  They took out all the windows.  So now you're just smashing the car without windows.  That's the best part of that bit.  Yeah, glass.  You put fucking goggles on the people, and you hope for the best.  You give them a sledgehammer, and they take out the windshield and the side windows.  That's why you watch a bit like that. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  But they had the fucking car in the parking lot with all the windows gone, because of  course the stupid fucking lawyers had to get involved, I'm sure.  They had to get involved with everything.  It's very dangerous.  You sure you want to do this at all?  So now you're just seeing...  We recommend taking out the windows.  Now you're seeing kids, like, just hitting the car with a sledgehammer, just putting little  dents in it.  Who cares?  Because, you know, the big photo op is the monster with the sledgehammer taking out the  windshield, and everyone goes nuts, and then after that, it's whatever.  Yeah, standing on the hood, just smashing the windshield in. 
[00:25:30]  But they're just banging this car and barely doing any damage, because it's hard.  You know, it's an old car to begin with, so who cares?  You're putting a few dents in it with a sledgehammer.  You think the lawyers got involved?  Of course they did.  Do they ever?  Of course.  But there's some great hockey games going on.  There was a bench-clearing brawl yesterday.  Yeah.  In the Canadiens game.  They have to throw everyone out?  Pretty much.  Yeah, this thing was amazing. 
[00:26:00]  And there's two Canadian defensemen behind the net, and Galchenyuk, who's playing center...  Oh, I guess they didn't like that, huh?  ...for the first time in these two games in a long time...  It's just...  Now, the reason they fought is because they were losing?  Yeah, it was a blowout, but...  Oh, boy.  ...this was kind of rare.  You had a lot of fights at the same time on the ice.  You don't see this that often anymore.  No.  They're all fighting.  Old school.  All ten players.  Getting beaten up.  Look at them.  They all fucking paired off last night.  Oh, that guy's going at it. 
[00:26:30]  Having your shirt held on ice and having your face punched has got to really suck.  They had five fights going on at one time.  We're going to do their best to get White and Cal out of this right now.  Fighting is...  I love it.  It's fucking crazy in hockey.  I love it.  You don't want to play off hockey at all, huh?  It's pretty damn exciting.  It really is.  For your standard fight, you just, like, go to the penalty box for a while.  Wow.  They're just beating the shit out of each other.  So hard with the helmets now. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, they're all slipping around.  The ref is in there like, get the fuck out of here.  And go back to your bench.  And in the old days, oh, wow, they're still going.  Still going at it.  And the fans just love it.  Oh, yeah.  You can hear them just losing it.  But if you fight in, like, basketball or something, you're fucking out.  Oh, yeah.  You're like...  It's still accepted in hockey. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  Baseball, you can't fucking do that.  No.  When you fight in basketball, you look like a complete asshole.  Yeah, yeah.  Even your own teammates are like, what the fuck are you doing?  They're not built for fighting.  Basketball fights are usually some blindside fucking, the guy never saw it coming.  And then some lanky arm comes swinging around from five feet away.  Yeah.  Now, these hockey players are just fucking crazy, man.  Animals.  Little bulldogs.  Every single one of them has missing teeth.  Yeah.  How do you take a puck or an elbow to your fucking teeth like that? 
[00:28:00]  Are there the pretty boys that just don't fight?  And then they got the goons that defend them?  Yeah, it's changed over the years.  I mean, now every team pretty much has a goon to take care of, like, the fighting part.  Yeah.  You get a couple guys on each team that are fighting.  Cooling it up out there.  That are still fighting.  Old days, everyone fought.  Without the helmets and shit.  And something like that, then everyone would jump off the benches and get in the fight as well.  But you're not allowed to do that.  That's an automatic suspension. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, if you leave the bench.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But the old school, man, you guys were in a fight.  Fuck this.  And everyone just gets on the ice.  It used to be amazing.  Takes a while to clean up.  And then someone, whoever, you know, changed the rule there.  It's like your old thing.  You can't bring it back now.  Can't bring it back.  Yeah, too bad.  That was so much fun.  We're going back to allowing people to leave the bench and enter a fight.  That's why when they put those rules in place, you know, it's over forever. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  It's a shame.  It's a real shame.  I had my kid's birthday party.  Just one quick observation.  It was an hour and a half party.  Is he feeling better?  Yeah, yeah.  Everything's good.  The little tyke.  Yeah.  The other one decided to not sleep the night before my son's birthday.  We were up all night and then had a kid's party Saturday.  It was a fucking nightmare.  How many little fellers do you have over the house?  No, no.  We went to a place.  Oh, you went? 
[00:29:30]  No.  No strangers get to go to my place ever.  Ever.  Where'd you take him?  It's just where he goes to school.  They do a whole birthday thing.  But it's an hour and a half birthday.  Do you remember this growing up?  It was an hour and a half and they had a lady that controls the whole thing and every  15 minutes they were doing something else.  I've never experienced this before.  And then an hour and a half, done.  Really?  12 to 1.30, 1.30, get the fuck out.  I don't remember that at all.  Do you remember when we were growing up or whatever?  You went to a birthday party. 
[00:30:00]  You were there all day, it seemed like.  Yes, exactly.  They had fucking activities.  It was like time to do the bubble shit, time to sing a song, time to put a fucking costume  on, time to eat cake.  Get the fuck out.  Sounds like a lot of activities.  No time to open presents there or anything.  Wow.  Take your fucking presents and get the fuck out of here.  Take a hike.  Next.  Go open them up somewhere else.  Next.  Did he feel like that was enough?  Were they all, we got enough out of it?  And his little three-year-old brain, it made complete sense, but if you're a parent, you 
[00:30:30]  felt like you're on fucking meth or something.  Like, what the hell's going on here?  Let's relax and calm down a bit.  When I was a kid, my parties were, my mom fucking, you know, did everything and organized  it.  And they were there all day, right?  And it was, yeah.  It was like an all-day event.  You ran outside forever and played in the yard, whatever.  You were all excited right from when you woke up.  And then your little guests started arriving.  And then mom would do things, you know, the pin the tail on the donkey shit and the fucking,  you know, other games and then the presents and cake and food and shit. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, then afterwards you'd just hang out and play.  Well, I got hit with the PC shit for the first time.  So the party starts and the lady in charge, it's a costume party.  And she goes, okay.  Hitler.  Hitler costume?  I would have accepted that one.  Oh.  All right.  We have three costumes.  You could either be, she says it to the whole room.  Now this is for your son.  And everyone else.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, there's three choices for everybody. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, they bring in a rack of fucking costumes.  All right.  And the parents are all on the perimeter.  And more importantly, the fathers, okay?  Oh, boy.  Because the lady goes, okay, you could either be a dragon, a pirate, or a princess.  And I swear, you could just see all the guys in the room.  They all cringe.  They all just held their breath.  It's like, oh, God, please.  They all held their breath. 
[00:32:00]  Pirate a dragon, pirate a dragon, pirate a dragon.  I'm proud to say my son picked pirate.  I'm like, and then I breathe a sigh of relief.  Imagine the little kid that's like, princess.  No, no, son, you see.  Right.  If my son said princess, what do you do?  Do you jump in and go, hell fucking no?  You go, son of a bitch.  You call a pissy eye.  How embarrassing for the other father.  Oh, my God.  I felt like all the eyes of the fathers were all just darting around the room looking at each other. 
[00:32:30]  Like, you're thinking what I'm thinking, right?  Daddy?  Princess?  We had no boy princesses at this party.  But I swear, like, as soon as she said the choices, we're like, seriously, this could be incredibly embarrassing for a father here.  Why don't they say, for the boys, we have a PC.  Because it's the PC shit.  That's what I'm getting at.  Because wouldn't you just say, all right, for the boys?  Yeah. 
[00:33:00]  Dragon could be a little, you know.  Yeah.  Pirate or fucking dragon for boys.  Dragon or princess for girls.  Right.  Right.  Everything using gender has to be wiped out.  Imagine if the kid would have yelled princess, how the other fathers would all be like.  And they'd all have to try to talk to the one.  Like, you know, it's all right.  Why not?  And then the kid's walking around as a princess.  Look at him sucking on the pirate's pig leg.  It was just shoot, kid. 
[00:33:30]  But all the kids line up.  And now you just see the anxiety of every parent praying they were going to pick the right outfit.  And even, I guess, even the little girls, you know, if they picked pirate, that could have been a little weird, I guess.  Not really.  Not as bad as a little boy picking princess.  The girls could wear any of the costumes there.  Because you've got that Pirates of the Caribbean kind of thing going on these days.  Right, right.  The girls can fucking dress like a pirate.  That's not a problem.  But, yeah, the boys, the fathers, imagine. 
[00:34:00]  I'm like, this is my kid's party.  And now the anxiety of hoping my kid picks the right fucking costume.  He didn't even pat an eye, though, right?  No, no, no.  Right to the pirate.  Right to the pirate.  All right.  You know, in the end.  All right.  In the end, you know, for the people out there, whatever.  You know.  But.  Well, in the end, you'd prefer.  Yeah.  Yeah, but that's the thing people don't talk about.  Uh-huh.  Like, yeah, if, whatever.  I'd be fine.  You know, but you absolutely hope that he's. 
[00:34:30]  Of course.  He's a straight male.  You know what a lot of people don't realize.  That's how fathers think, you know.  They don't realize that fucking.  What you're hoping for, I gather.  I'm not a parent by any stretch of the imagination.  But I guess what you're hoping for is just that his life doesn't have to involve that undue stress and rejection and fucking the complications of being gay.  Right.  Like, it's not like, oh, God, he's gay.  That faggot, I won't fucking talk to him anymore. 
[00:35:00]  No.  It's like, you just like anything else.  You don't want him to have to.  It's still the easier way to go.  Right.  As much as, you know, we've come a long way.  It's still the easiest track to be in.  Yeah.  So if you notice, like, a little fucking, he's grabbing the princess dress.  Oh, God.  You kind of got to go like.  But every father.  They're just.  You could see no one's breathing.  It was the most intense thing.  As I was thinking of the costumes.  I'm like, this is supposed to be a dumb kid's party. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, boy.  Nobody wanted to be a princess.  You know that every time there's at least one or most times.  I would assume.  One boy that.  That's.  I don't know.  Whatever.  Whatever.  But it's a good time.  And if you ask me, that proves that it's.  It's.  You're born in that.  Into.  I think so.  I think there are some guys that just like anything else, like Wiggers.  They love the lifestyle.  They weren't born that way, but they want to be.  I think for the most part, you're born that way. 
[00:36:00]  But I think for the most part.  I think there's a little percentage of people.  Right.  Very small percentage of guys that are like.  Insert that.  Whatever.  But there was that fucking.  Did you see somebody sent that twerking video of that fucking kid?  That was.  What?  I didn't see it.  The most disturbing thing.  And you watch that and just go.  Yeah.  That kid is fucking.  Was born gay.  Right.  There's no way you can learn that that quickly in life.  And you can't be that gay and put it on.  You'd win an Academy Award.  Mm-hmm.  It was.  Yeah. 
[00:36:30]  Some.  Some.  Boy.  Twerking.  It's.  I mean, this parent.  This father must have just been like.  Oh, boy.  That boy went princess.  He.  He went princess.  Fucking.  Over the top princess.  Over the top.  I think his name is Anthony.  Yes, bitches.  I'm back.  Look.  He's so gay.  Okay.  But.  I'm sorry I took such a huge break from making videos.  But I am back.  I'm going to be making videos every week.  Like everything.  The mannerisms. 
[00:37:00]  Everything.  You didn't hear me.  You didn't learn that.  You can't judge a book by its cover, they say.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, I was a gay kid.  Whatever.  And.  Right.  Summer is just on.  Yeah.  But.  There's no doubt in my mind.  Yeah.  And.  I'm more pissed that he has three million views on his videos.  Oh, sorry.  Well, I hope you could maybe go that route if you want to do a gay twerk video.  Yeah.  Go to his twerking because that's the where.  It's like, oh, he's just a gay kid.  Then it just gets disturbing.  Notice how I say appropriate and twerking in the same exact sentence. 
[00:37:30]  Warning.  Watching me twerk is scandalous.  Scandalous.  How old is he?  I don't know.  Oh, jeez.  Yeah, yeah.  That's.  Oh, I know this one.  He's twerks.  Could you imagine this father, like, sees this.  No.  Gets the computer and he's like, let me see what the boy's up to.  And he's.  He's twerking.  These two million nine hundred thousand views are probably all guys jerking off.  They're all creeps. 
[00:38:00]  Fucking pedos.  Watching this and jacking off.  Twerking is over.  You can cover your eyes now.  Yay.  Oh, it's uncover.  That was it.  I knew it was time to twerk when.  Oh, he made a mistake.  Boo.  Yeah.  So.  Yeah.  After my twerking rant of last week, people decided they were going to send me that.  Wonderful.  Thank you.  Hold on.  Before we move on, I think we got a princess scenario that actually happened.  Oh, no. 
[00:38:30]  Mr. Norton.  Vic in Connecticut.  Yep.  I'm here, guys.  Did it happen to you?  I was at a party.  My cousin's throwing a party for his little kid.  Yep.  And they break out the costumes.  And his little nephew puts on the fairy princess.  Fairy princess.  You've got to be kidding me.  I pulled my cousin aside.  I said, you get that thing off that kid or he's going to be in for years of therapy.  Tad? 
[00:39:00]  See.  I'm sure.  I.  Go ahead.  Sorry.  I'm sorry.  And the women are cheering him on.  Like, oh.  Of course.  Look how cute.  I'm like, nah, nah.  Let me do his makeup.  I have no kids and I'm turning bright red.  I'm like, nah, nah, nah, nah.  Stop it.  Right now.  It was an unbelievable.  I never.  I didn't have a clue.  Wow.  I didn't have a clue because I guess when we were growing up, if we had, it's too many  years now, but if we had some kind of costume party, I think there would have been a few 
[00:39:30]  costumes appropriate.  I'm going to just say appropriate for little boys.  And then there would be a few costumes, uh, costumes appropriate for the little girl.  Right.  But they just threw them all together.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  And every fucking father sitting there.  Oh, God, please.  No.  No.  There was a, there was one Halloween where I guess, uh, I wanted to be a devil.  And, uh, my mom comes back from the store with like a devil kind of costume and shit. 
[00:40:00]  And red, like stockings.  Right.  Panty, panty hose.  And, uh, and she's like, yeah, you put these and wear these, you know, and I'm like, of  course, you know, I start crying, uh, because I didn't want to wear fucking panty hose.  Yeah.  Uh, even pissy eyed little Anthony knew that you don't fucking put on the panty hose.  So I made her find red jeans.  Oh, God.  And I wore those.  The devil wears red jeans. 
[00:40:30]  All right.  Yeah, it worked.  I'm like, I'm not wearing fucking panty hose.  Right.  I always thought it was weird when guys dress up as women for Halloween.  It's like, oh, look at me.  It's crazy.  There's something there.  You think there is?  Yes.  You go to the party and like the big jock guy is like, look, I got the wig on.  I put on some makeup.  Look at my tits.  My tits look good.  Go game.  Everyone feel my tits.  He's so fucking into it.  Just stop.  So Vic, what, what were the, the fathers doing when he put on the princess outfit? 
[00:41:00]  You know, I think I'm the only one who had that reaction.  You know?  Maybe they're used to it.  Maybe they're all dressing up in fairy costumes.  I think every, I think most fathers would be thinking something in their head.  I think it was mostly a room full of women, you know?  And that's what really hurt me.  Right.  Just my cousin was there in that circle when the costume was going on.  Yeah, right.  And he's just looking out with that blank face. 
[00:41:30]  And I'm like, come here.  You gotta, you gotta help that kid out.  Do him a favor.  And then he turns out to be the one that's, uh, the jock later on down the road.  This is years ago now.  Yeah, I guess, I guess in the end it's harmless.  But I mean, you know, I saw, I saw the fathers this past weekend all just hoping their kid  was going to pick the right costume.  Well, so they always say you can't judge things, but like, not judging right or wrong, but when  you listen to that kid talk in the twerking video, every person hearing that would go, 
[00:42:00]  yeah, that kid's probably gay.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  So how come, like, if you had to go to court and go, why does he, what is he gay about?  Um, I, uh, the voice, but what about the voice?  Terrible, yeah.  You know what I mean?  When you break it down, we all kind of just sometimes know things intuitively, but you're  taught that you should shut that part of yourself off and don't pay attention to it.  There have been many instances where people have said, uh, well, I, I heard on the phone  and it was a black guy.  And then it's like, well, how did you know it was a black guy? 
[00:42:30]  It's like, well, I heard a certain dialect.  What does that mean?  What?  And everyone gets so defensive, but you know it when you hear it.  They try to make, they try to make you uncomfortable by forcing you into the description.  Yes.  Right.  Yeah.  All right, Vic.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  And you're not always right.  All right, man.  You're not always right, but you're probably right more than you're wrong.  Toothpick, Vic.  Hey, there's a, I caught my five-year-old playing princess in kindergarten.  My son used to put on a princess dress in daycare.  Disagrees with us.  Who disagrees?  I don't believe that.  Where's the disagree? 
[00:43:00]  I don't believe that.  Friend used to, uh, Megan?  Let me see.  Oh, Megan's a regular.  She calls a lot.  Yeah, disagree with you guys.  I don't believe that.  Megan.  Someone's called me.  Hi.  Hello.  I don't necessarily think, I gotta say for the record, I don't necessarily think if you're  your little three-year-old, uh, son is putting on a princess outfit, it means he's, he's heading  down the gay road, by the way.  I do.  But as a, as a father seeing that, it was pretty, uh, it was pretty, uh, intense.  But don't you think that it's just kind of your own hangups and shit? 
[00:43:30]  It's all the adults' problems.  Of course.  Of course it is.  Um, but that guy that said that the kid would, would be in for years of therapy.  I mean, don't you think if you're a kid who does turn out to be gay, they'd be in for  years of therapy if your father was forcing you into pirate outfits your whole childhood  and you wanted to be in a princess outfit?  I think we all realized that Vic was a little more closed-minded than the host of the radio  show.  Just a little bit.  We all understood that immediately.  But Megan, you're not paying attention to the way, like, I mean, kids fucking brutalize 
[00:44:00]  each other.  Like, the kid who wore the dress, the other kids would get on.  Mm-mm.  But not, not at this age.  Not at that age.  Not at three.  Not at that age, but as time went on, they would.  If there was a kid walking around in a, if a boy was walking around in a princess outfit  at this party, my, my kid's party, the kids wouldn't have thought twice about it.  At that age, no.  They would have been the parents sitting there going, oh, oh, Jesus.  But as time goes on.  My son's friend would, every morning, he would run for the princess outfit and a crown and 
[00:44:30]  put it on.  And he wore it every single day at school, the dress up stuff.  All right.  The kids absolutely couldn't even, like, notice it.  They just, you know, that was what he wanted to do.  Is he gay or is he too young to tell?  I think he's gay.  He was, like, three or four.  And I knew him really well.  And I could already say, I think that kid is going to be gay.  Yeah.  All right.  You know, his parents were supportive, so that was good.  Yeah, that is good in the end.  Well.  That's so fucking little.  In the end.  All right, Megan.  Thank you. 
[00:45:00]  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  I guess the point being, it was just very stressful for the fathers.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know.  That's something.  So you go.  And what, like, how does this party work?  Are there people, you know everyone?  No, because he's at that age where, you know, you just invite everyone into his little class.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  He'll never fucking know their names or fucking be friends with them.  That's what makes it weird.  So you got kind of strangers just giving your kids, you know, gifts.  That is odd.  He had a few of his cousins there and stuff. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  And a couple of his little friends.  But in general, he didn't know anyone at his party.  And why were they there?  What do you mean?  Like, why were the kids that he didn't know there?  Well, we just gave invites to everyone in his class.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Dude, you should have put W. You should have put like racial things on the seats and sectioned  the kids off by race.  Oh, my God.  Did you see how repulsed the other parents were?  Could you imagine the outrage?  Now I got more fucking shit in my house. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah?  Oh, my God.  I'm getting pushed out completely.  Whoa.  What do you got?  I'm down in one room that doesn't have any kids stuff in it.  That's it?  Yeah.  It's ridiculous.  And I'm lucky.  I have a lot of space for someone who lives in New York City.  And it's all kids stuff.  It's everywhere.  I got to wake up in the middle of the night and throw a lot of shit away again.  Does he ever notice it?  No.  No.  He doesn't know.  I've thrown, I've thrown, maybe I shouldn't say this.  Oh, boy.  I've got a lot of family that listens.  I've thrown complete toys out that he didn't even touch. 
[00:46:30]  Just in the box?  No.  It was out.  Oh, okay.  But I look for the dumbest excuse, like, oh, God, there's a scratch on this.  Gotta get rid of it.  I throw it down the garbage chute.  Like, just giant, like, displays.  Oh, shit.  Just to make a little more room for yourself.  Oh, yeah.  But in the end, he doesn't notice.  Yeah.  And I have given a lot of toys and stuff to charity, but every once in a while, it's like,  it's a pain in the ass to get it all ready, and I have to go downtown and stuff, so every 
[00:47:00]  once in a while, man, a big, chunky, you know, fucking toy gets thrown in the garbage  chute.  Just hear that fucking diminishing, echoey sound as it bounces off the fucking garbage  chute.  Has he ever once noticed?  Like, hey, where's that thing I used to...  Nope.  No, you kind of have to be...  You kind of have to figure out what he's actually playing.  Know what he likes.  But I knew this one thing, I don't want to say what it was.  He wasn't really, you know, playing with, and there was nothing wrong with it, and I  just fucking heaved it. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Gave us a little more space.  If you're looking for space based on just throwing away some toys, wow, you really are  looking for just any free space.  And the second one's about to crawl, so it's all gonna...  It's gonna be double now.  Yeah.  Because she's gonna need all her shit.  Well, I don't know how people live in New York City with kids that don't have a lot  of room.  Yeah, a little one-bedroom apartment.  And there's a lot of people like that.  Two kids. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  So, that was my weekend at a kid's party.  I see you throw all their toys out and just give them books.  Good reading material.  Yes.  He's got a hundred books already.  But don't make them both read before they're ready.  Just look at the page.  Oh, look at this.  Yeah.  Wow.  Birthday party weekend.  The fucking costume thing was so weird.  Yeah.  That was a strange little moment.  Yeah.  It's...  It was always weird going to other people's houses for birthdays. 
[00:48:30]  I liked my birthday parties because it was like my mom doing everything.  Right.  And you go over to some house and it's just weird.  It's like, oh, I made some fucking walnut egg salad.  And as a kid, you're like, oh, no.  I want cake.  Is that a real thing?  I don't know.  Oh, okay.  It just sounds like something that would be horrible.  Like, everyone else's mom, they sucked.  They didn't know how to make good shit.  And their parties were terrible.  Well, then the other thing is, you know, my kids opening up all those birthday presents. 
[00:49:00]  And then you have all the kids in the room that start wailing because they don't understand  that none of the presents are for them.  Um...  Fucking kids are the most selfish, greedy little things.  They just...  They don't understand.  So then you have to, you know, drag individual kids away and the parents have to talk to them.  Like, no, your birthday's in August.  You gotta talk to a fucking...  Well, it is twisted that you have all these three-year-olds in a room and there's just one  huge pile of toys for one kid and no one else.  Okay, why am I not special? 
[00:49:30]  They don't get it.  They just assume if there's presents in the room, everyone gets some.  Mine.  Right.  Mine.  I remember being embarrassed at my birthday parties.  Like, everyone was giving me gifts and, like, I didn't deserve it.  Yeah, I would always be...  Oh, boy.  I love the presents, but I would always be embarrassed.  Yeah.  Happy birthday!  Happy birthday!  Yeah, you were embarrassed.  I didn't have to deal with positive attention.  Little Jimmy was like, oh, I don't, uh...  Don't give me accolades and toys and... 
[00:50:00]  Dude, but you'd have the fucking, the little, uh, the folding card table with that shitty cover  that you'd have to put, like, weigh it down so the wind didn't blow it off.  Oh, yeah.  Those little fucking birthday table covers.  Yeah, with the big heavy red fucking candles.  Those big glass fucking orb candles.  Yeah.  What are they doing with, uh, helium balloons?  One last thought and then we can move on from this shit.  Yeah, we wanted our place to look good, so we got, like, a hundred balloons. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  You know, all different colors and they're on the ceiling for the most part.  Some would string so the kids could play with them a little bit.  Yeah.  By yesterday morning, they were all on the ground.  Really?  Were they...  Are they mixing the helium?  They cutting that shit?  Were they mylar or they...  No, we got a couple mylars.  They're, they're still strong.  Yeah.  They're still up in the air strong.  But the basic helium balloon...  Were they deflated a lot or were they...  Not really, but they're...  They, they...  Weird.  I'm trying to think.  They might have, yeah, they probably lasted 18 hours. 
[00:51:00]  Maybe the rubber is more porous these days.  It's just, but what...  I don't understand that.  Because if the mylar was still floating...  Mylar is strong.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know.  Cutting helium with air?  I think they might be cutting it.  I just need to know.  It's, uh, it makes for horrible radio.  I'll be...  I understand that.  But we, we, we spent a good fucking, you know, penny on that shit.  Yeah.  I want to know. 
[00:51:30]  I was hoping they would be, you know, up on the ceiling for a day or two.  They didn't, they didn't even last 24 hours.  Decorate the place all up real nice.  Yeah.  A little, it's your birthday.  Happy birthday.  My life is so not my life anymore.  It's over, Johnny.  Man.  Yeah.  I wish these fuckers would have, like, taught me a little more before.  It's so weird.  Yeah.  But it's cool.  You know when you guys see Life of Pi?  I watched that yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  Now, now let me tell you before you say what you thought of it. 
[00:52:00]  A lot of people either love it or a lot of people hate it.  There's no in between with this movie.  I liked it a lot.  I didn't love it.  But I did like it more than I thought I would.  Yeah, I did, too.  You know, there was more to it than I thought.  And it was well shot.  And I was like, wow, man.  And then in the end, I was like, you know.  Yeah.  That was weird at the end.  Yeah.  But I liked it more at the end.  Yeah.  I was assuming that it didn't happen.  I didn't know that was a 3D movie, though.  Like, this is where I kind of wish I had that 3D TV.  Because it was really, the colors were beautiful. 
[00:52:30]  And I heard it was shot beautifully.  Yeah.  The CGI was great.  Yeah.  Did a good job with that CGI.  I'm the stupid one that read the book years ago.  I'd probably rather read the book, honestly.  I'd rather read the book.  But I want to see the movie first and then read the book.  Does that make any sense?  Because you liked it, though, huh?  I did, man.  Yeah, it was.  Do you think that happened?  Or do you think.  We all know what option it was.  Right.  We all know.  We all know, don't we?  And then someone.  And then I saw Amy yesterday.  We were talking about it.  And she told me it was a metaphor for religion. 
[00:53:00]  I was like, oh.  So if you haven't seen it, turn the radio off for a few seconds.  I'll give you five seconds.  Well, hold on.  We'll get the answer to the helium fucking book.  Oh, okay.  Yes.  And I'll give people a chance to fucking tap out for a minute.  Matt, go ahead.  Yeah, I think it's because of latex allergies.  They changed the material in the balloon.  So Anthony said it's more porous.  Oh.  Maybe the helium comes right out.  The latex allergy?  Yeah, everybody.  Kids have latex allergies.  Oh, yuck.  Nothing in schools with latex. 
[00:53:30]  Doctors' offices, no more latex.  I didn't know you could be allergic to latex.  What about the rubbers?  Yeah, I guess that.  I mean, that's my problem.  Condoms.  I think it's actually a powder that they put inside of them.  Yeah, I'm allergic to latex condoms.  It makes the blood rush right out of my cock.  Exactly.  Man, we just didn't have allergies growing up.  I mean, we had them, but we didn't know about them, I guess.  Don't pay attention to them.  Everyone just had asthma.  Allergies with sneezing.  You just know a million kids that had asthma. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, yes, asthma.  Sneezy and wheezy.  It had nothing to do with fucking, you know, oh, I can't look at a peanut.  Peanuts, latex, all that shit.  All right, Matt.  And then someone else was saying there's a short supply of helium out there.  So maybe they are cutting that shit.  Short supply.  The United States is really the only country that produces helium.  Why?  It seems like it would be an easy thing to produce.  We have all liked the helium.  I don't know.  That's why the Hindenburg.  How do you produce helium?  That's why the Hindenburg fucking burst into flames. 
[00:54:30]  We weren't selling our fucking helium anymore to Nazi Germany.  And they had to fill it up with hydrogen.  Right.  So they came here and kaboom-o.  Wow.  Yeah.  Well, we had a choice between oil and helium.  And we're like, forget the oil.  That's messy.  Yeah, yeah.  We got balloons.  We can make balloons float.  Fuck you, making your cars run.  Yeah.  We'll fly to work every day.  What a fucking bad turn of events that was.  A terrible move.  Back to Life of Pi.  So, Jimmy.  Amy's raised the point that it was a metaphor for religion. 
[00:55:00]  Like, you can, these are the stories, and maybe these events didn't happen, but we're  telling you them to teach you a lesson.  Like, maybe the event that we thought was happening wasn't really happening, but the  lesson of it was taught, which actually made perfect sense.  Like, yeah, maybe it was a metaphor for religion.  Huh.  Maybe that's why it was written.  Could be.  The story.  I don't know.  I like that.  It was almost that mashed chicken angle.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Suffocating the chicken kind of a thing, where it was like, oh, really? 
[00:55:30]  So that's how you remember it.  I think they should have tied a couple of those things in a little bit better.  A couple of the animals in a little bit better.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But I did enjoy it a lot more than I thought.  Maybe I cried a little.  Aw.  Aw.  At what parts?  I honestly don't remember.  Yeah?  What else did I blubber at this weekend, like a fucking complete seed gargler?  I blubbered at something else, too.  A movie? 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, I think so.  Hmm.  You don't remember?  No.  I remember when I cry.  Oh, man.  You should remember when you cry, don't you think?  No.  It depends.  I watch a lot of movies that make me cry.  I can't remember.  Was Life a Pie?  It's something else.  Watch, I go back.  It's just some fucking X-Tube porn.  Well, now I remember.  Yeah, I thought he was going to come in her face, and he didn't.  The vagina.  That was so mean.  Yeah, it was just so beautiful. 
[00:56:30]  That was so beautiful.  What was it?  I don't know.  Fuck.  Why don't we break?  I don't know.  Our food is here.  Jimmy's going to try to figure out what he cried at this weekend.  We got Doug Stanhope coming in today.  Oh, yeah.  In about an hour.  We, uh, what else we got?  Oh, we got the fourth anniversary of one of our favorites of all time, Tippi Tom.  The anniversary of his death.  Four years?  Four years ago today, we found out that Tippi Tom kind of left us. 
[00:57:00]  He was our homeless friend for our newer listeners.  Tippi Tom!  Wow!  He came in as a goof, as a homeless goof.  Yeah.  Just to kind of, you know, point and laugh at, to be completely honest with you.  And then it turns out that we all end up loving the fucking guy.  And he gave us great, great radio.  He was a good one.  Gave us great radio.  Yeah.  And, uh, he's, he's pretty much everyone's favorite around here.  Yeah.  Definitely in the top five of, uh, all the people that have come and gone from this radio show.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:57:30]  Over the years.  Classics.  So we're going to, what, play some, uh, Tippi Tom clips in and out of breaks today.  Sure.  Something a little different.  So it's, uh, officially Tippi Tom day, huh?  Yeah.  All right, E-Rock, hit us with one.  You got 30 seconds, uh, Papa Rock, to make Francine say what's on the paper, okay?  He's thinking, all right, what is it?  Uh, whisper it to everybody, Jimmy, out there in Radio Land.  Things on a plane.  You didn't hear that, did you, Francine?  Things on a plane.  All right, here we go.  Here's Papa Rock. 
[00:58:00]  Go.  Skewaters.  What?  Aeroplane.  Things on a plane.  Oh, wait a minute, but it wasn't you.  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel on Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show presents Primetime Sam Roberts and One Question with a Guess We Couldn't Get. 
[00:58:30]  Big Time Music Star, Pop and Country Music Sensation, Taylor Swift.  Primetime Sam Roberts here with Taylor Swift.  Taylor, do you like grapes?  Absolutely.  Thank you so much for your time.  This has been Primetime Sam Roberts and One Question with a Guess We Couldn't Get on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:59:00]  Let's see how this comes out.  All right?  They're right there.  All right, here we go.  I got a break.  I'm going to put it on the station.  I can't get it.  Oh, this is nice.  Oh, you're a whole.  This is a story about a man.  He always was so lonely at night.  But his voice was rowdy.  You could hear it all through his train station.  And I'm going to sing this one.  This is about tippy-toe, Tommy. 
[00:59:30]  Let's go.  All we go.  All we go.  All we go.  It's late at night.  And now you have nowhere to go.  My money's gone and off for all my friends.  And the cop says to me,  Hey, you smell bad.  Get out of here.  And he says, 
[01:00:00]  And you know I have an angel.  And he says,  That ain't you.  Shelter me from the falling rain.  Don't leave.  Don't you have bombs?  This is my life.  I'm livin' with so much pain.  Shelter me from the falling rain. 
[01:00:30]  You have bombs.  This is my life.  I'm livin' with so much pain.  That's just a little piece.  Action.  Three seconds.  The OP R3 show.  And I think it's gonna be a long, long time  To touch down brings me round and get to find  My money's gone and off for all my friends. 
[01:01:00]  Shelton John sucked his hundredth cock on this day back in...  Wow.  41 years ago for this song?  Shelton's the hardest singer to figure out what he's saying in his songs.  What do you mean?  Like every song you'll try to sing along  and you'll just have to make words up  because you can't understand what the fuck he's saying in so many songs.  This is called Rocket Man. 
[01:01:30]  Oh.  Oh.  I'm a rocket man.  Like there's so many fucking...  Put on another Elton song.  Go ahead.  Let me see.  Just another one of his hits.  I'll try to...  I'll try to...  How about Leave On?  Well, maybe not that one.  How about...  Philadelphia Freedom.  Iraq?  Did you ever hear Candle in the Wind?  Where were you?  I'm right here.  I only had Rocket Man loaded.  I'm pulling the other ones up. 
[01:02:00]  Oh.  I watched footage of Elton John yesterday  singing at Princess Di's Wake.  He's great.  That actually made me cry a little bit.  Jesus.  It was good.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  The live version.  The live version, of course.  Why are you playing the live version?  I wanted to...  Because it's the first title that came off.  No, I wanted the studio version  because you can't understand what he's saying.  We don't want the live version.  There we go.  All right.  Okay.  Hold on. 
[01:02:30]  All right.  It used to be a Rolling Stone.  The cause was right?  Oh, yeah.  But that was tough.  Yeah.  But I need to find the answer on the road?  Yeah, but it's...  I understand what I'm saying now, though.  I used to be a heart beating for someone.  Used to be a heart beating for someone?  Yeah, but it changed.  Look, you know the words.  No, I don't.  No? 
[01:03:00]  Unless I say it and all my work gets done.  Unless I say it and all my work gets done.  Really?  Yeah.  I live and breathe.  Well, the choruses we all know, but...  It's like...  I mean, I don't know the lyrics just from hearing it,  but I've never read them either.  No, I completely understand what I'm saying, though.  It's just...  Your brain has to work a little harder.  Just a little harder to figure it out.  But he just didn't know how to write a fucking song, Elton John.  He needed that Bernie guy. 
[01:03:30]  He needed Bernie to talk to him.  Bernie wrote, like, all of it, right?  Yeah, all of it.  But they shared credit on the writing?  Yeah, because I guess Elton wrote the music, right?  Right.  And Elton knew the music, and Bernie put it to words.  Yeah.  The wordsmith.  That's a great team, though, if you think about it.  Oh, man.  A few hits.  You think they ever, you know...  There's a tough one coming up here.  Lyrically.  Yeah. 
[01:04:00]  Right.  Not here, but...  Right.  Right.  What year was this song, by the way?  It was, right?  Bicentennial.  I remember being in the car, my mother smoking her Benson and Hedges with her fucking sand  ashtray.  And my father liked this song.  Benson and Hedges.  Elton John had a lot of fucking hits, man.  Holy shit.  I think this one is very hard.  Okay, let's hear it.  I think.  No.  No.  Okay. 
[01:04:30]  Not that part.  People Chew the City?  Chew's the City.  Chew's the City.  I heard it, but...  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Zapped them right between the eyes.  Like jizz.  He did have quite a few fucking hit songs. 
[01:05:00]  All right.  Thank you, E-Rod.  Wait, I wanted to hear that part where you can't understand them.  I think it's coming up.  Is it coming up?  Yeah, it's one of the verses, like...  Jimmy just knows his song.  Yeah.  You picked the wrong song.  He really knows it.  It's an unbelievable song.  What a toe-tapper.  That's all right.  I never really liked this one.  Oh, really?  It's one of my favorite Elton John songs.  I guess it's the next verse. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  I think so.  Peace.  It says something about...  I used to be a something-something for someone.  All right.  I used to be a...  Yeah.  And I would always just throw in big bottom.  All right.  Let's go to the next verse.  Is there even another verse?  Yes. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  I think so.  It's got some of those elements of disco in it.  The 70s.  Oh, they all had to go to the disco route for a little bit.  A lot of guys fell for that.  Oh, man.  Did they ever?  No.  No.  I guess it was not.  Wait.  Wait.  I don't know.  How much more long is this song?  About a minute left. 
[01:06:30]  Maybe it passed by already.  Maybe I missed it.  Oh, all right.  I'm sorry.  While we were babbling.  Wow.  I fucking missed it.  You know whose birthday it is today?  Whose birthday?  Well, there's a couple birthdays.  Willie Mays is 82.  Say hey, Willie.  And I'm old enough to remember when he played.  Ooh.  What the hell?  I was very, very fucking young.  Very young.  You remember that, Sam, right?  No.  Willie Mays playing. 
[01:07:00]  Well, he played for the Mets.  That's why I remember.  But he was an old man in the outfield by the time we got him.  But as a little kid, I remember getting all excited and telling my dad,  we got Willie Mays.  Like it was a big thing, but meanwhile, man.  No, he was past his prime.  Oh, my God.  Way past his prime.  Way past his prime.  I believe the Mets got him when he was in his 40s or something,  which was unheard of back then.  Not a lot of guys played in their 40s.  But then Bob Seger is 68 today. 
[01:07:30]  Wow.  I've always been a fan of Bob Seger.  Wow.  He's got a lot of fucking great songs.  Ah, here we go.  Little Night Moves, right?  Um, yeah.  I've got to tell you, this was in my wheelhouse back in the day.  What do you mean?  Uh, well, all these songs were kind of like,  you'd listen to them and be like,  yeah, man. 
[01:08:00]  That's what I'm trying to get through, man.  Thanks.  He's talking to me, man.  He's talking to me.  This song's about me.  Yeah.  Is this the song with Points Up High?  Yeah, yeah.  Some firm tits is what he's singing about right there.  Yeah, out there in the...  Out in the backseat of my 60s.  Well, maybe not 60s.  Yeah, you know, you're listening to it going, 
[01:08:30]  yeah, I'm just trying to fuck this chick.  Work on my Night Moves.  I never liked him, but I think I never gave him enough credit.  Oh, I fucking love seeing his voice.  All these coming-of-age songs is pretty much what he was doing.  You know why?  Because that one song I didn't like,  Old Time Rock and Roll,  I kind of judged everything he did on that.  Oh, yeah, that was kind of his, like, hacky hit.  What about On the Road Again?  That's great.  That's the one Metallica covered.  Yes.  I prefer their version, but it was great.  Metallica did a great version,  but then you always go back to Seeger's version. 
[01:09:00]  Turn the page?  Turn the page.  That's what it's called, right?  Yeah, turn the page is the name of the song.  Yeah, that's a good one.  And I'm sure you don't like Cat-Man-Doo.  Yeah, I never liked Cat-Man-Doo.  I'm going to Cat-Man-Doo.  He screams it, you know.  How does that go?  Cat-Man-Doo!  Yeah, Cat-Man-Don't.  Good one, Chippo. 
[01:09:30]  Thank you.  68, huh?  68 today.  I think he's still doing it.  Yeah.  I believe he is.  And fuck the Rolling Stones if we're talking music for a second.  Oh.  Oh, here's Cat-Man-Doo first.  I never liked this one.  No.  No.  I didn't hate it, but.  No.  It wasn't on my top ten of Seeger songs. 
[01:10:00]  I hate it.  Yeah.  I hate that.  I hate a stutter in a song.  Let me see.  Oh.  I'm going to Cat-Man-Doo.  Dude.  That's how long.  Dude.  How about turn the page to fucking end on a nice note for Seeger?  Thank you.  You're making me hate him again.  I just turned into a Bob Seeger fan and now I'm against him again.  Ah.  Attaboy.  Fuck.  I love this. 
[01:10:30]  We should just play this whole fucking song.  Oh, my God.  That would take a while, huh?  Some highway.  East of Omaha.  You can listen to the engine running out as one long song.  You can think about the woman or the girl you knew the night before.  Patelka did do a good version.  They did a fucking phenomenal version. 
[01:11:00]  Hetfield could really man up any song.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm trying to think of that one.  I know one.  On the road again. 
[01:11:30]  There I am.  Up on the stage.  Here I go.  Playing the star again.  There I go.  Yeah, Hetfield really does fuck it.  I love Metallica covers.  I love when they cover a song.  Oh, fuck yeah.  They make it their own.  Yeah.  Seeger looks real dorky these days.  Someone's saying.  Wait a minute.  Let's go to Todd in New Jersey.  Todd.  Todd.  Hey there, guys.  Good morning.  Hi, Todd.  Most 68-year-old guys look dorky, though. 
[01:12:00]  Don't you think?  What are you talking about?  He was on CBS Sunday morning about six months ago, a year ago, and it was hard to believe  it was the same guy that he used to rock out to, you know, and Hollywood nights and  all that.  So, you know, one guy would still go see him, but oh my God, he doesn't look anything like  I remember.  I think I saw that Sunday morning.  Sunday morning.  Sunday morning.  Seeger.  Yeah.  He looks exactly the same.  He's really gray, right?  He has the same.  That's Michael McDonald.  No, I think Bob Seeger had the exact same hair as well, but it's all just, you know, 
[01:12:30]  gray or white.  Computer not working well.  Oh, I remember that song.  That was the one.  We got tonight.  We got tonight.  That was the one where I think I was driving back from upstate, not driving.  My friend of mine was driving, and I was in the back of the station wagon.  I was in the back of the station wagon with this girl, right?  And we were just making out, Jimmy.  Making out.  Making out.  We were making out, and it was all the way from, like. 
[01:13:00]  I might have listened to that song this weekend, too.  Did you like it?  No.  It was terrible.  It was all the way from upstate back to Long Island.  Yeah.  And this song is a pretty long song, and it was going on.  We just made out, like, during the whole song, and I was like, oh my God, this is the  song.  Right.  You're living the song now.  This is what we're doing.  I'm living the fucking song.  And, you know, you're fucking, like, 16 years old, so, you know, a little high.  You get a finger in the stink hole?  His own.  He fingered his own ass. 
[01:13:30]  She's like, what are you doing?  I fingered my own ass.  Trying to cum.  And crammed down his dungarees.  Oh, that's terrible.  Fingering my own ass.  Can you imagine how freaked out a girl would be if you were making out and just fingering  your own ass vigorously?  Terrible.  That's why jeans had holes in them back then.  So you can finger your own ass holes.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  Oh, I call it ringing the bell.  I'm ringing my bell.  All right. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah, because it was a weird thing, because, like, you know, we had tonight.  Who needs tomorrow?  Like, and I didn't know, like, what we, we weren't going out.  Were we going out?  You know?  And then we get back, and we have to fucking hang out with friends and everything.  I don't know.  Are we going to want to fucking be, like, an item and stuff?  But that didn't matter, Opie, because at that moment, in that station wagon, on that road  back from upstate, we had tonight.  How great was it when you could separate one from the pack? 
[01:14:30]  Oh, just have it run off from the rest of the pack.  When you had just one separated from the pack.  So good.  She makes that fucking quick bad turn away from the herd, and you fucking right on the  end.  Oh, birdie.  When you were able to separate one.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, man.  Like a cheetah.  What happened with this girl?  Did you fuck her?  Did you go out with her?  Yeah, man.  Who said girl?  What happened with this adult male?  This older gentleman?  Yeah, don't leave us hanging.  What happened with this little relationship? 
[01:15:00]  Well, we actually did.  When did it go wrong?  I'm not sure.  Boy, let me think.  We actually did start going out, though.  Nice.  We did.  And I actually relinquished her of her virginity on that trip upstate.  We went upstate.  We hung out at the parents' cabin.  Were the parents there?  No.  It was me and her.  It was Dave Simolesky. 
[01:15:30]  Simo.  And the girl that I was with, her older sister.  How old were you guys?  16?  17?  Something like that.  I wasn't allowed to do that shit at 16.  Oh, man.  It was crazy.  I wasn't allowed to leave my driveway still.  These girls wouldn't let...  Jesus.  The parents of these girls wouldn't let them go to, like, certain movies with us.  Right.  Without saying, well, I want Mary Jean Leonard to go with you, too.  And I'm like, oh, fuck that shit.  Right.  So...  But she would be like, okay, have fun at the cabin.  What?  I don't get it, either.  So we would go up to this cabin in Herkimer County, New York. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, outside Utica.  Yeah.  And it was a family cabin.  And we'd go up there and fucking just, you know, feel out this new thing called sex.  Jesus, that's great.  Yes.  It's fantastic.  I had a strict mom, man.  I wasn't allowed to go to a cabin with a girl at 16.  I don't think I was, either.  You weren't allowed, either, right, Jimmy?  Your stories are fucked up.  I was trying to bang this broad for the longest time.  But your stories aren't of the norm, man. 
[01:16:30]  No.  No, most fucking 16-year-olds weren't allowed to do half the shit you were able to do.  But there's always guys like Bill D'Angelo, my buddy Bill, like, he's had that kind of  parents like Ant did.  I mean, I think they were more normal, like, quote-unquote, like, you know.  But they would let Bill go out and go to the woods and do camping and hunting and all  that shit, and they kind of let him do the same shit.  He had a lot of freedom.  We went on a couple of religious retreats.  Yeah.  They thought that was all right, like sleepovers.  But I grew up in a very religious town, so we got swept away with that for a while. 
[01:17:00]  Damn.  Did you fuck the girl in the cabin?  Yes.  Yeah, exactly.  I did.  It was, uh...  You put the tip in and jizzed all over everything?  Oh, man.  Forget about it.  But I was trying to bang her for a while, and she, you know, she was virginal.  A while.  At 16.  Well, yeah, for however long that is.  But she was virginal.  And, you know, had to kind of work it.  And then one night at the cabin, uh, she was like, okay.  I'm like, what?  And I was like, what?  What?  What? 
[01:17:30]  Holy shit.  This is gonna happen?  Me and my brother ran through that family like locust.  Holy fuck.  That was, uh...  I think there were four...  Three daughters?  Four daughters out of the three.  Let's see.  Dave took care of the one.  The older one.  Then there was the next one down.  And then I, like, took care of that one.  Relinquishing her hymen.  And then my brother took care of the next sister down.  And then a couple of years later, I took the next sister down. 
[01:18:00]  Jesus.  The younger one.  Wow.  That was like...  Oh, it was crazy.  Good for you.  In the same cabin, by the way.  Young Anthony putting up numbers.  In the same cabin.  Really?  Yeah.  Wow.  The older sister was very mad when she found that out.  Really?  Yes.  So now you were in condoms?  No.  Were you pulling out?  No.  No, no.  Uh, uh, let me...  Wow.  Let me think about that.  Did you fuck their asses at all?  No.  Back then you didn't fucking asses?  Oh, God, no. 
[01:18:30]  You didn't do any Greek?  Back then?  No, back then.  The girl would fucking lose her mind.  Right.  What?  That was...  No!  It was straight fucking missionary.  Oh, all right.  Now they just laugh at that shit.  Gals.  Gals today just laugh at that shit.  But there was a time...  Fuck no.  You would be looked at as a complete fucking weirdo.  If you don't fuck a chick in the ass now, you're a faggot.  Right.  What are you doing?  She'll say that.  Girls like, yeah, exactly.  She'll fucking tell you. 
[01:19:00]  But back then?  Oh, God.  You would be a degenerate.  I'm saving myself for marriage.  Fuck my ass.  Right.  They're putting the right channel number in...  They're not putting the right channel number in the O&A ads?  Oh, boy.  Who the hell knows?  Come on.  We're having a good time today.  Who is this?  We don't need to deal with this shit today.  Anthony in Jersey.  Anthony.  Hi.  Hey.  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  So, in light of the wonderful radio from last week about the channel change and you guys  not knowing, I had on Alt Nation, which is the music I usually listen to, and that's 
[01:19:30]  before I switched it over to you guys.  Good story.  And you would think the week of the channel change, they would let people know they're  still running ads saying that you guys are on 105.  We are on 105.  We're on 105 right now.  When is the change?  Thursday.  Thursday.  Thursday is the big changeover, and we're all keeping our fingers crossed that we're not  going to lose too many fucking listeners through this change.  We are going to lose so many listeners.  Of course we are.  It's just the nature of the thing.  But I'm talking about the guys that don't get 103 right now. 
[01:20:00]  They're praying they get 103 starting Thursday.  They've been told they will get 103 starting Thursday, but watch what happens.  Thursday, we'll have a shitload of people calling and bitching and complaining.  I will guarantee that.  So, hopefully, things will be kind of smooth.  Very difficult situation.  And then, I guess, there's now a problem with our on-demand, and the Radio Wizard wrote  me.  I didn't write them back.  There's a bunch of channels, though.  It's not just ours.  Well...  But it's just this, the app.  It's like...  Why can't they figure it out, man?  I don't know. 
[01:20:30]  I don't know.  Whatever.  Thanks, Anthony.  They're most important people.  Thanks, Anthony.  All right, man.  Good luck to you.  Yeah, because I don't know for sure, reading tweets and stuff, will people be able to get  the channel on all radios, or certain radios?  Or will they have to update their radio?  No, some people are not going to get the channel.  It's obvious.  It's obvious.  Some will.  Some will all of a sudden get 103, but other units probably aren't equipped to do that.  So they're not going to get it. 
[01:21:00]  I'm telling you.  Crazy.  I will bet a lot of money on that.  It's just crazy.  And the tweets will come in.  They'll let us know.  Oh, yeah.  When they realize they can't get it, those that can't.  Hopefully, they all will.  Oh, yeah.  Man, when we came to Satellite Radio, it was like, wow, the future.  And now you sit here eight years later, it's so antiquated.  Yeah.  It really is.  Just because they can't figure out the basic shit of it still.  It really feels antiquated.  Yeah.  People don't want anything to be hard in their lives. 
[01:21:30]  And this is still a very complicated thing.  I don't know why.  Oh, I think that chick dumped me.  Yeah, she did.  Okay.  She did?  Yeah.  I was bugging me.  I'm trying to think back.  I don't know.  You think?  Obviously, she dumped you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Or you'd be celebrating 30 years of marriage.  Of course, she dumped you.  But we're trying to figure out, oh, well, I guess you could have been doing the dumping.  Oh, and then I had to fucking go to school.  And I remember seeing her in school and everything.  And she was with another guy.  And I was all like, boo. 
[01:22:00]  Bummed?  Yes, of course.  Bummed.  And that was the worst feeling ever.  Because I got very, uh...  I would get so attached.  Oh, was I a latchy little fucker.  I'd get so attached.  Mine, mine, mine.  Yeah.  Mine!  Then when it didn't work out and they were with somebody else, that's like the worst feeling  for your young...  Oh, it would just last forever.  ...your young, growing body.  Oh, you get that feeling.  That fucking death feeling.  Stupid fucking hormones made you really hypersensitive to everything. 
[01:22:30]  Man up.  You thought your fucking life was over.  Oh, God.  Get a hold of yourself.  God, I want a time machine.  Oh, just a bitch slap myself.  What are you doing?  You know that girl that dumped you?  She's going to be a fat fucking pig someday.  Yeah.  Gives a fuck.  Oh, God.  Bob Seger, 68 years old today.  People saying he just played in Brooklyn.  Somebody else just wrote and said he's still rocking. 
[01:23:00]  Is he still rocking?  Well, look, he's all gray and stuff, but he's got his arms up in the air.  Like he's rocking.  Does he still have that Bob Seger voice?  That's all I care about.  That's interesting, because that is one of those power voices that you would think you  need youth behind to still pull off, you know?  Oh, I was going to mention the Rolling Stones really fast.  Fuck the Rolling Stones, and I'm a big Rolling Stones fan.  We talked about this.  They're struggling to sell those $600 tickets to their upcoming tour. 
[01:23:30]  $600 tickets.  So they're forced to cut prices.  To what?  I don't know.  I'm sure they probably only dropped it $100 or something, but still.  I think a basic ticket was $600, I think.  I don't even think you were getting anything special for the $600.  Just a regular ticket?  It's not like fucking...  I'm not positive.  I think Travis might know a little more on this one than me, but I don't think you're  getting anything special for the $600.  I think that's a basic ticket to see the Stones. 
[01:24:00]  Here comes Travis now.  Was that a basic ticket price for the Rolling Stones?  You weren't getting anything special for $600, right?  Those were some of the better seats.  Oh, they were?  Yeah, they dropped them down to $85.  They went from $600 to $85?  They had to sell them.  $600 to $85.  Fucking assholes.  Yeah, so it was basically a, hey, give us $85.  We'll tell you where you're sitting the day of the show.  Wow.  You go to Will Call.  You pick up your tickets.  Because some of them were in...  What was the basic ticket price? 
[01:24:30]  Is it between $85 and $600, Sam?  Yeah.  I mean, the highest is $625.  Okay, so you were getting pretty good seats for $600.  Yeah, but people don't want them.  And then the lowest is $165.  You could justify that.  Come on.  They don't care.  With a meet-and-greet, I could see it, but are they doing meet-and-greets at all?  No.  No, I mean...  No, there's a few packages.  What are the packages?  The hospitality package.  Hospitaliano.  That's $2,000.  What do you get there? 
[01:25:00]  Click on the question mark.  Oh, yeah.  VIP entrance.  Price level one.  Floor ticket.  Pre-show dinner.  Exclusive merchandise.  Yeah, no meet-and-greet, though.  Fuck, damn.  Fucking $600.  For what?  That was $2,000.  Jesus.  So there was like 500 tickets left on StubHub.  Like the day of the show, people were just slashing their asking prices.  So you could see him strut around. 
[01:25:30]  Mena!  Jisabawa Quay, Mena!  Try to take me upstairs for a ride!  I don't like him live.  I'm not a big fan of this version of the Star Wars.  His live fucking shit these days, he's just marching around fucking reciting the lyrics.  Sounds good for his age.  Noises.  If you want to be in the tongue pit, it's $1,500. 
[01:26:00]  The tongue pit?  Oh, God.  I was in the snake pit for Metallica.  And that's where some of the $85 seats ended up being.  Yeah.  They had to get rid of them.  Back in, I want to say, 1989, 1990, I was in the snake pit for Metallica.  I was underneath the stage.  They played right above my head.  It was the coolest fucking thing ever.  They had something called the snake pit.  I'll never forget it.  That's when I first met Metallica.  I got pictures with all of them.  Not all of them.  I didn't get Lars that day, I believe.  Yeah, I didn't get Lars, but I got the rest of them.  We were in the snake pit, and they were running right above our heads. 
[01:26:30]  Wow.  Do you remember the snake pit?  Metallica's snake pit?  And it was for the Black Album.  It was one of the best shows I ever saw.  I never liked moshing or any of that shit.  Never got into that.  Can you look up the snake pit for Metallica?  Is there a video of that even?  I like mosh girl.  And armpit.  She has all those photos to be taken down.  Good luck.  Well, there was a specific website that was just posted. 
[01:27:00]  But no way they know who it is and everything?  She's come forward?  I think the person who made that website knows who it is, but I don't know who she is.  But she rules.  She's the best.  Kid Rock is doing a tour.  Every ticket, every show, $20.  Yes.  Jason in South Carolina.  That's fucking cool, man.  Good for Kid Rock.  But it's also Kid Rock in 2013.  Nah, Kid Rock has a lot of songs, though.  Sure, but not a lot of people are jumping to go see Kid Rock.  Yeah, that is true. 
[01:27:30]  He fell off.  What happened to Kid Rock?  He was huge.  He had a big hit a couple years ago.  A couple years ago.  That fucking show.  But I mean, but he's never got this fucking, he's never got this popularity that just has  stayed at a level, you know?  Because he confused the fuck out of his fan base.  Did he?  Yeah, because he goes into four or five different genres.  Yeah.  Look who he came out with at the same time.  He's the only one that's still even sort of relevant.  No.  And it was him and Limp Bizkit.  Even though we don't like them anymore, Linkin Park is still selling a lot. 
[01:28:00]  Linkin Park came a little after me.  Yeah.  But yeah, Linkin Park is still popular.  My name is Kid.  Oh, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.  Who didn't like Bob with a bottom, bang a dang, diggy diggy?  I hate it.  What's wrong with you?  Oh, this is great.  I heard this the other day, man.  This is good shit.  I love this song.  Every time I listen to the entire song.  It's okay.  I don't hate it.  It's very good.  This fucking...  You had to, like, crank this.  You really don't like this. 
[01:28:30]  It's okay.  And now this was  When this first came out  You listened to it just going  This is the greatest thing ever recorded  This fucking shit was like  I can't agree with you  You would just crank it so loud  Drive like a lunatic  Music is over  See this part  What?  This is great  You never love this  No way  The arrangement's great  Yeah, I just  And I thought it was cool  Because I almost knew the words 
[01:29:00]  Yeah  I would jump in every once in a while  With the words I knew  Well, you know all the heroes  At the methadone clinics  Of course  I much prefer his country shit  Like, uh  Only God Knows Why  Is a fucking amazing Kid Rock  So he has some great stuff  But the rap shit I never liked  Get in the pit and try to love someone  Love someone  Oh my god, yeah  It's just  It's all distorted shit  With Kid Joe, right?  I'm trying to love someone  Oh, and people just  Oh, Joe C  I mean, right  Joe C  I love Joe C

No  No  Or did they bring  Oh, they brought him back for this  By the way  Mick Jagger  Turns 70 this summer  And the tickets were really expensive  So, I mean  They liked it  Because they're going right to the bank  But I'm telling you  There were some people  Complaining that it was just  You don't like fair banter, Jimmy?  No, I know  Speaking  Well, for 15 bucks though  You could see this  Iron Man  Indestructible

[01:43:00]  It made him look taller  Yeah  And my lips  And then I watched a documentary on Phil Spector  And you forget how many amazing songs this guy put out  Oh yeah  Yeah he was in there for a while  Oh my god  He might be the greatest ever  Of course yeah  All that big wall of sound  Yeah  Yeah he was a musical genius  But what a fucking lunatic  That was just to hide all of his victims  Yeah  The wall of sound  Yeah he hit him on the wall of sound  Too bad they didn't knock down that wall of sound  They might have found a few bodies 
[01:43:30]  He did  He was a weird dude  Yeah  And then he kissed me  He did fucking both big Righteous Brothers songs  And then he killed me  God damn a secret  Can you find a Phil Spector song in Iraq  Oh  He'll be busy and they're having some talks  E to the R  Looks like Obama decided  Fuck the Just for Men huh  He's looking a little grayer  Yeah but he's not dying it as much as he used to  Yeah  They just showed him on the TV 
[01:44:00]  No one will bury that kid up there in Boston huh  Good  Nope  Bombing suspect number one  I guess there's a funeral home guy  He's like eh  He's making some calls  Trying to get this fucking kid buried somewhere  Well a Worcester funeral home finally said  Alright we'll take the body  Worcester  Why?  Because they're desperate for fucking business  But they can't find a cemetery to bury him in  That's the problem  The cemetery yeah  Well the problem is like what 
[01:44:30]  What's his ties to Boston  Get him the fuck out of Boston  And bury him somewhere else  Why does it have to be in the Boston area  Take him back to uh  Go anywhere else  Mother Russia  That's the biggest problem is burying him in Boston  They're trying to go for an unmarked grave somewhere  And how about this  Enough of this  The word will get out where he's buried  Enough Islamic tradition  And what is Muslim religion  How about this  Who gives a fuck  When you kill people in a public bombing  You lose all right 
[01:45:00]  To a religious  They had to  Ceremony  Wash him  And  Fuck that shit  Yeah but the  The Ammons up there in Boston  Fuck them too  No they're turning their backs on the kid  Oh they are  Yeah  They're doing the right thing  They're like we don't want any part of this one  Good  They've been  Very vocal about it  Yeah  Saying no man  That's  We don't want to do this shit  Yeah  Someone else is going to have to do this one  They absolutely have been saying that  But the biggest problem is burying him in the Boston area  Yeah 
[01:45:30]  What's his ties  He went to school there  Lived there for a while  He didn't live his whole life in Boston right  Yeah they've  I think they've looked at three states so far  Oh they have  Yeah  And  Yeah everyone's saying  No  Get the fuck out of here  We don't want you  We don't want you  I don't blame them at all  He doesn't deserve a decent burial  And if his family is  They're very religious  How about this  Too fucking bad  Too fucking bad  If you wanted  If your kid should have been buried 
[01:46:00]  With Muslim tradition  And he died naturally  That's one thing  Yeah  But he didn't  He blew up people  Right  Yeah  He killed people  Publicly  For tough shit  Fuck him  Just burn his body  That's it  Burn it and get rid of it  Because religion should mean  Zero  Yeah look what they did to  Fucking bin Laden  And they just  Even that they shouldn't have  Given him a Muslim burial  Slip him into the ocean  No  Just wrap him in fucking bacon  Like a scallop  Yeah  And throw him over the fucking  Side of the boat

[01:59:00]  It's waste  Yeah yeah  It's product  Everything that made him  The bad guy  But here's the thing  CNN  My father died  Like everyone does  He's meat  He's waste  He means nothing  We have him in a cup of ashes  That my brother keeps  For  Yeah just to  In case we want to  Keith Richards  Snort it with coke  One day for funny  But he had a cemetery plot  In Paxton, Massachusetts  Worcester suburb  That we never buried him in 
[01:59:30]  Who gives a fuck  We're not gonna go through  Some stupid ritual  Right  And drive out there  To leave flowers  For no reason  We have  A cemetery plot  That is available  For free  For the meat  That used to be  A guy accused of bombing  The fucking Boston Marathon  We are giving that up  It's at the  Worcester County Memorial  Fucking cemetery place  In Paxton, Massachusetts  Where we had to live  For three years  As kids  Where they fucking  Hated us 
[02:00:00]  And we hated them  They're all the kids  Who wore  Levi corduroys  When we were still  In tough skins  And it's just  This piece of shit  Snotty fucking  Cunt town  Where we had to  Fucking  All the hate  That I have  In comedy  Is rooted somehow  In this town  Paxton, Massachusetts  Like the people  That you know  You hated  And you felt  Belittled by  You don't know names  You don't remember events  It's just the entire  Just that three years  Where my mother  Was married to that  Cocksucker  That we had to live  In this shitty town 
[02:00:30]  Yes  I want to  Smite you  By putting the  Fucking  And I'm dead serious  I called my brother  He looked it up  At 6.30 this morning  To find out  The name of the cemetery  We'll fucking bury you  In my dad's plot  Suicide bomber guy  It's fucking  On the table  You want him  Dumped in there  No shit  Call the press  Call AP  And we have to  All we have to do  Is use the Doug Stanhope  This is where that idea  Came from  The Doug Stanhope 
[02:01:00]  Celebrity death pool  We have a logo  That came from the idea  Where my brother and I  Are saying  Hey we still  Have dad's cemetery plot  And there's nothing in it  We're not going to bother  Putting his ashes in there  Who doesn't care  We don't have  Like an extended family  That has reverence  For the dead  Let's go put  A gravestone  That says  I'm with stupid  With the finger pointing up  Oh that's pretty good  Offend other people  Yes  That would be very offensive  So if I can use  That gravestone  Yes  That would be very offensive 
[02:01:30]  Does anyone know  How to pronounce that name yet  Not really  Oh no  Let's try  No no no  Yeah  He'll never go down  In history  No it's not a  Lee Harvey Oswald  Exactly  That's easy  He has no middle name  John Wilkes Booth  Once you have a name  With two names  That are that difficult  To pronounce  You don't try to throw  The middle name in  Tamerlan  Oh yeah  There you go  The brothers are harder  Because  Zucar  Or some shit  DHC  DKZ  But this is a little  Crazy

[02:08:00]  On a Friday and Saturday night  Because that's why  To justify their existence  Because they work all week  To justify all week through Friday  Right  They have to  So they do that  And then they get hammered drunk  And fuck up everyone else's weekend  That's around them  And they're not good at it  Yeah  Again I'm a drunk  But I consider myself seasoned  Right  At my drunkest people will say  Almost to a fault  Where they'll go  I didn't even know you were a hammer  Right  I was blackout drunk  Well you seem normal  Which is almost a problem  In that  Yes  People  You can't say

No  Everyone has stories  No  Oh when they just fucking forget  That they woke up  Did things  And not even  Not really drunk  Yes  Where I've been  With my manager  Was staying at my house  And I took an ambient  Had a few cocktails  I'm going to bed  It's kicking in  They tell you not to do that  And then came back out  And had just completely  Lucid, rational  Business conversations  Where in the morning  He brought it back up  And I go 
[02:09:30]  What are you talking about?  He goes  The thing  You told me last night  He's a Scotsman  I can't do it well  I thought he was Indian  The thing  The thing  We talked about this  And I go  I have no  Well you came back out  I go  I came back out  I like  Wow  He knows me as a drunk  So he was even confused  That's odd  That that part of your mind  Can be functioning  And then the part  That just remembers all of it  Is just asleep  It's gone  So you're just out there  Having a normal conversation 
[02:10:00]  But uh  Not recorded  Your DVR wasn't recording  I've heard so many stories  Like even normal  You know Steve Marmel  Judy Brown's husband  He almost had a  Plane grounded  Because he had  Just a couple of  Whiskies  And Ambien  On a plane  And just started  Creating a ruckus  Again  No  No memory of it  Wow  And do you take a lot of  Ambien  I've heard horror stories about  Yeah  Why'd you stop  Well I realized  Getting prescriptions  Is a pain in the ass  Xanax 
[02:10:30]  I only take it to sleep  And I realized  They still sell  Fucking OTCs  Over the counter  Night time sleep  Sleep aid  Night hall  It works just as well  Does it really?  Like I'm going over to Mexico  And getting my balls busted  By border patrol  Or customs  Trying to bring back  Fucking like  Ambien  Yeah fucking  Night time sleep aid  Works just as well  I use Valerian root  That's like totally  Like orgallic  It actually works okay  I'm sure not as well 
[02:11:00]  As Ambien  Melatonin and all that  Melatonin works for me  For like a day or two  Like I took Melatonin  Saturday night and Sunday  I was fucking  Out of it all day  I was just tired  I didn't feel high  I just felt like sleepy  Yeah  Yeah I can't  I try to  Like change them up  Like I'd take Benadryl  Occasionally  I don't want  I don't want to get  A tolerance for anything  Right for any one thing  So I would do like  An Ambien  And then a Benadryl  And then  I had a night out  A few times  Where I'd like  Take a Xanax  And then you're drinking  And the next morning  Was pretty much like  Alright  So I went out 
[02:11:30]  And then  Yeah  But that's always  The problem  Is you don't do it  To go out  No no no  I don't understand people  I knew people  That would take  Like six bars  Of Xanax a day  Jesus Christ  Like I would be  I've never taken  More than a bar  What's a bar?  A bar is even a lot  Two milligrams  Which I  Like if I was flying  When I lived in L.A.  L.A. to Heathrow  Non-stop  Is about 14 hours  And I'd take a bar  For that  To be out  For the whole  It helps you sleep  For that?  Oh you're done  A bar for me 
[02:12:00]  First you get a nice  Kind of  That's like a maximum  First you get a nice  Like  Ah  Hmm  It's feeling  And then  You're just gone  Out  And I'm at a place  In my life  Where sleep  Is the best  Fucking thing  Sleep is king man  Sleep is the  Fucking shit  I'm a terrible sleeper  Are you a good sleeper?  No that's why  I take this shit  Can you stay asleep  Or you can't  Like I woke up this morning  At 4.30  And I just couldn't  Go back to sleep  I can't fall asleep  And then I can't stay asleep  Instant  I'm like a cat  Fucking curl up 
[02:12:30]  I don't sleep long  Even if  Even if I knock out  I rarely  Sleep more than  Six hours  Right  Six hours is a long time  I love six hours  I don't even get six  I normally go to sleep  Probably 1am  The earliest really  1am  And I'm up by  Fucking you know  Quarter to five  That's a nap though  Yeah but then  I'll come home  I'll come home from here  And then  Sleep  Panicked  At six  Going  Oh fuck  I have to be up  Yeah 
[02:13:00]  Where'd you walk from  How far do you have to walk  Three blocks  Oh okay  I do though  It's like  During  But that's like  My sleep sleep  That's why I hate New York so much  Is I always stay in Times Square  And I assume that the entire city is that  That's it  Yeah yeah  And I  I guess part of my head knows  It doesn't suck as bad  As I think it's  Times Square  And I think it sucks  It's horrible  Yeah  Just walking out to smoke a cigarette  And you're like  I can't even stand outside  Without being  Caught in a wash  Like there's a flood 
[02:13:30]  Of humanity  Yeah  Yeah yeah  I fucking avoid  I'm always playing here  Somewhere fucking near here  Or I'm doing a show  So I always  Any of the hotels on Broadway and shit  You just walk out  And you're like  I wouldn't trust any of them  Why  Just bed bugs  Bed bugs before  Fuck that  The renaissance is nice  Oh I'm sure  That's not the hotel I'm at  That's what sucks  Every time you get put in a shitty hotel  You can't complain about it on stage  Or on the air  Because then everyone knows  Where you're staying  And they'll call 
[02:14:00]  Fuck with you  Yeah yeah  Fuck with you  You stay under a different name  How do you do that?  Just go around and go  Don't use Doug Stanhope  I guess you could ask  Yeah  I always do that  Now they're just gonna call hotels  Then I  For the same reason  I have sunglasses  On my head  But I'm not wearing them  To cover up my bloodshot  Obvious drunk eyes  It's the same reason  I wouldn't go to the front desk  And go  Listen  Don't use my real name  Yeah that just sounds suspicious  Who are you? 
[02:14:30]  That's one of those  See something say something moments  I think  It's like  Oh it's a real name  He doesn't want to fucking  Call the cops  Yeah can I leave my backpack  In the garage  You should use D.B. Cooper  They're going with the leisure suit  Those are some nice fucking  I want to go back to the leisure  How many leisure suits do you own?  I went through a period  Of football jerseys  Right  I remember that  I don't have a lot of money  But every penny is disposable  Because I don't have kids  Yes  And my house is paid for  And I don't live like you 
[02:15:00]  I don't live in a place  That takes a lot of money to live  So I went through a period  Of football jerseys  Where I bought  Every team's football jersey  And then a few throwbacks  If I don't  Yeah  So I have like 70 football jerseys  Holy shit  On eBay  That are now in storage  Because I went to  So I have like  I don't know  Like 45 jackets  Really?  How much do the leisure suit  Cost me by?  Well you try to get them  In thrift stores  Right  Or I get them on eBay  Yeah you can't just go  Into a fucking store 
[02:15:30]  And  You find something  That's the problem  You go  Oh I got this coat  For four dollars  Yeah  Well then I went on eBay  To accessorize  And find pants that match  Yes  Damn  Do you ever have them  Do they fit?  Well the ones that you get  That don't fit  You either have  Well I've never had  A coat taken in  But I've had pants  Taken in or taken in  Yeah  Yeah  My arms are short  I always have to  And my legs  I always have to have  Picking pants  It's humiliating  Do you?  Trying to buy man's clothes  Stand up here Mr. Norton 
[02:16:00]  Yeah  How much  You lost enough weight  How much  Did it change your  Like  Like I'm terrified  Because I'm trying to quit smoking  But I know I'm going to get fat  And I just spent all this  Dumb money  On fucking  On fucking clothes  They're not going to fit  So  Do your pants fit the same?  No  I've got  I think I have a photo  Of the clothes  That are going to Goodwill  Because I can't fucking  Let me see  I have  I've literally lost  80% of my wardrobe  He lost 30 pounds  I should have  Almost 30  Yeah  If you can hear me 
[02:16:30]  Fucking sipping on the air  Nothing makes me crazy  That's why I can't listen to NPR  They always close talk the microphone  And they go  Between  Fucking mouth sounds  Physically violent  I'm with you  When I hear people eat  It drives me insane  Nothing worse  When it's moist eating  No good anymore  Yeah  All those clothes  Are getting fucking  Wow  It's a fucking huge pile  Let me see the pile  It's all pants 
[02:17:00]  That's a pile  Four piles of clothes  It's probably about 75 different items  And you can't take any of those pants out  Percentage  Of your  75 or 80% of my pants  Gone  Maybe even more  Yeah  Gone  What size were they  I don't even know  Because they're different  I like Abercrombie  Because it was a 32  I could actually fit  But probably a 34  Down to a 30 or something  I just can't wear them anymore  32 is  That's the inches  There shouldn't be a 32  That doesn't fit  I just  Sorry  Let's not go off on fashion 
[02:17:30]  I couldn't  I know  I'm taking the fucking cans off  You don't want to hear  I hate my voice  Even more in reality  Dr. Drew's giving up  Celebrity Rehab  Yeah  You were very vocal  With the Dr. Drew  I know  I could fucking  Go on and on  It's  That fucking bit  Is great  It's  It's just so truthful  We played it on the show  Yeah  Someone told me that  And I went  Fucking great  No we loved it  We've been keeping  Tabs of his fucking 
[02:18:00]  Kevorkian like  Foray into reality television  What's Norton's take on this  I actually like Dr. Drew  Yeah  I do yeah  Well he's a fucking  AA kid  Yeah I'm recovering  He's an AA kid  You're fucking recovering  Motherfucker  No I'm not  Stop it  I'm telling you no  I know enough people  Who've gone out  After 15 years  And they pick up  Like they never left off  Not one person's ever  Come back and said  Things were better  So personally  But you  You don't drink  Is recovered  You're not always 
[02:18:30]  Yeah  We're all one bullet  Away from suicide  But that doesn't mean  We're suicidal  But whatever it is  That makes me  I'm recovering from  Go ahead  Recovery to me  Is an active thing  I mean for other people  Maybe it's not  But for me it is  It's uh  I know that if I pick up  Where I'll be  I have no doubt  It's not  It's not that they  Brainwash me  I know exactly  But until you do that  You're recovered  Right  Um  I think that's what  Being in recovery  I should say  Yeah I guess  Technically Doug is right  You are recovered  But it's like 
[02:19:00]  It's still an active  Thing  But the whole program  Of Alcoholics Anonymous  Keeps you subservient  To oh I'm not  I'm not in control  Of my own life  I need to do this  All the time  It's this like  Milking you into religion  It's where  It's you know  God is the basis of it  And if you don't have God  There's no way to believe  In AA without God  That's completely untrue  The chapter to the agnostic  In the big book  Tells you how to work  AA without God 
[02:19:30]  And the chapter is  Well this is how  You believe in God  I can't speak about AA  I'll just say this  I would say  Any group that talks  About God  I know enough people  Who are atheists  Or agnostic  Or just completely  Like my own struggles  With fucking higher power  God can be  Group of drunks  Any power that is  Fucking doing something  I can't do  Whatever that is  A power greater than you  Yeah and there is one  And the bottom line is  My best thinking  Got me to where I was  And whenever I have a problem  It's my fucking best thinking 
[02:20:00]  And the bottom line is  The results are  I was one way  And now I'm this way  So whatever it is  I can intellectualize it  But your best thinking  Has you sober  For 20, 30 years  No it's because  26  It's because I did  What other people suggested  And it's like  Not drink  Nah it was more than that  It's about helping other people  It's about changing the way I am  So  Because you can not drink  And be a dry drunk  You can not drink  And just be a miserable dry drunk  That's just the rhetoric  That they teach you  I grew up with this  I was the same way 
[02:20:30]  And I believed this shit  Because my mother was AA  I was a kid doing homework  In the back of AA meetings  And I just took all this  AA will tell you  In the fucking  That if  If  Fucking  Completely  Fucking stop  My brain just stopped  Right there for a second  What is a dry drunk  By the way  A dry drunk is somebody  Who stops drinking  And does nothing to change  Who they are  Or what makes them that person  Uh oh  I don't believe you can change 
[02:21:00]  Who you are  Well of course you can  I mean  Maybe some people can  I can only speak for myself  Um  And you'd be  A dry drunk is somebody  Who's always white knuckling it  And doesn't change  Any of the things  That make them who they are  In a negative way  So they're just not  Putting the substance  In their body  So they're not drinking  But they're miserable  And there's plenty of times  I'm a dry drunk  Where they're fucking  They're not facing  Like they're not looking  At life on life's terms  They're bitching  Complaining unhappy  All the time  The same shit  That caused them to drink  Is there  And they're changing  None of their fucking personality 
[02:21:30]  But AA teaches you  That you cannot  Change yourself  Without AA  I can quote  AA like scripture  A lot of  I stood at a crossroads  I would say this  And again  I'm not going to  Say anything about AA  Itself  The only people  If you  Without AA  You'll end up  Dead or in prison  Or institutionalized  It's in the fucking  12 step people  Talk about their own experience  And they never say  This is the only way  To do it  I know that  They say  There's one suggestion 
[02:22:00]  Where they say  Try what we've suggested  For 90 days  And then go out  And try some  Controlled drinking  It is attraction  It's like  If this doesn't work  For you  Fine  They never come out  On outside issues  It's not a cult  Because they don't  It's like  If you want to stay  You stay  Most people don't  Most people go out  And drink again  It's just for people  Who want to be there  But AA tells you  AA is the only way  That works  I've never ever  In all my years  Of being sober  Heard that  Bring me the big book  Of AA  I'll find it  I've never  I've never stood 
[02:22:30]  At a crossroads thing  That we know people  Who have tried and failed  Almost  From being a child  Which I don't even  Remember my childhood  I can remember  A lot of the  Fucking nonsense  That  But there are people  Who are just sharing  What's worked for them  Like  Nobody ever said  This is  The only way  And without this  You're a debt  Because I've heard it raised  You know  People have talked about  That I know  Who are sober  It's never been said  This is what worked for us  That's what people say  There was no way  We never knew 
[02:23:00]  Any way we could stop  And here we are  Stopped  And staying stopped  And living productive lives  This is what we did  If you want it  This is what you should do  If you don't  Do it your way  Knock yourself out  There are people who  Because I know several  That were just miserable  Rotten drunks  That just fall down  Embarrassments  That just stopped drinking  And they're fine  There are people  I know a million of them  Absolutely  I don't know a million of them  I mean I know  Now that we're aged  I know a lot more 
[02:23:30]  I know  Sure  You used to be fun  Well yeah  I was kind of an asshole too  Yeah you're right  Yeah  It was fine  They had kids  They go  Yeah I can't do that shit anymore  Maybe there are people  That can do that  Good for them  I mean but nobody  Would disparage that  Or say  They can't do it  They're not  But they don't say  I'm in recovery  Here's what they say  They just stopped  That's them  And they're fine  But I know that  The things that  In my life that have changed  Or that I need to change  I know exactly where it comes from  Everything I've learned  About myself  That's real  Like how full of shit I was 
[02:24:00]  And again  They talk about  How easy it is  To intellectualize  Smart people  Have a much harder time  Getting sober  Because it's so easy  To intellectualize  That's big book stuff too  Of course it is  There are people  Who are too smart for AA  That's in the big book  It's not saying that  It's saying that  No that's  Actually I believe  That's a quote  People who are  Intelligent  Really intelligent  Can very easily  Justify anything they do  Can very easily  Explain everything away  I mean it just cuts off  Every single angle  Of bullshit 
[02:24:30]  That I had  And again  It was written in the 30s  And in the early 40s  So yeah  There's stuff about  God  Driller for sale  A rent  Let me pen a little book  A little tome  But it's  If it works for people  And they don't tell other people  They have to believe it  Which they don't  And they have no opinion  On outside issues  And they want people  To protect their own  Unanimity publicly  First of all  We're getting a little broad  With they  Because that's like  People who say  Oh a true Muslim  Alright  There's a lot of they  In AA  Yes 
[02:25:00]  Whoever's running the meeting  Really decides  Well this meeting  Is about this  I can only speak  About AA  As a certain  Whatever  I don't say  If I'm in it or not  I don't ever break  Personal anonymity  Or say I've ever been to it  Because maybe I have  And maybe I haven't  It doesn't matter  I respect that  Do you go to meetings  On the road?  I do a lot less  Than I should  Let's say that  I do  When I'm doing  The right stuff  I'm happier  And I feel better  When I'm not  I don't feel as good  That's just the reality  It's what I've noticed  In 26 years 
[02:25:30]  I'm not saying  You're wrong  For doing anything  It's like people  Who go  Hey religion  My brother's a guy  You know how I feel  About fucking  Child breeding  Fuck you  Don't have more people  But yeah  My brother had a kid  And he was the guy  That we all thought  Might snap  At one point in his life  That would  Shoot up an office plate  He had that kind of rage  Paxton, Massachusetts  You're getting a fucking terrorist  And I'm putting my brother's name under  Because you're a fucking bunch of cunts 
[02:26:00]  And I'm giving up my  Has this made the fucking  Rooters  Not yet  Fucking news feed yet  I don't think they  I'm putting that guy  In my dad's fucking grave  I don't think they believe you  In Paxton, Massachusetts  We're trying to get the funeral home  On the lawn  Look at you guys like Mitch Hedberg  Brilliant comic  Smart, creative, interesting guy  And it's like  Look at what a fucking waste that is  And it's like  The other  Let's say the other option  Was getting sober  In this  Like  It's never the better option  To go the way he went 
[02:26:30]  Ever  You're doing the classic mistake  Of confusing everyone  As being like you  No I'm not  You're a fucking  Brilliant sober guy  But again  You were drunk  Until you were 19  You didn't even flesh it out  Right  18  Flesh it out  But I know where it was going  It was an impossibility  That I would have continued  A sober Hedberg  And A.A. Hedberg  Is the most depressing thought  I could imagine  I don't think he would be him  Like I think  That's the illusion  That we tell ourselves  That that is now a part  Of who I am 
[02:27:00]  It's like smoking  No that's  Again  You're making everyone  The same as you  There are people  I go  Alright  You're a fuck up  Sean Rouse  Is brilliant  He would be brilliant sober  He's not sober  He should be sober  He's a guy  You don't go  Come on  You can have one  He's a fuck up  But alcoholics and addicts  Are like me  You know what  We all think  We're that unique  We all have that  We're not  In certain ways  But you know what  We are all the same  I think Hedberg was  Yeah  He went too far  I think it's easier 
[02:27:30]  To swallow his death  If we look at him  That way  It's easier to handle it  I knew him  I knew him too  Not as well as you  But I also know  That it's never better  To be dead of heroin  Than it is to be alive  And trying to create sober  I've never  No matter how creative  You are under the influence  You are never  A better artist  Dead  Than you would have been alive  And it's sad  That that waste happened  I can make some lists  Sure  At the break  Of people that 
[02:28:00]  Yeah  If they had died  At Hedberg's age  Well they'd be recognized now  Instead you're like  Ooh he's still around  Trying to do this  That's something  He had his moment  We like to look at it that way  Because it's  It's less painful  To realize  That this was a waste  This brilliant guy  A lot more to offer  Is what you're saying  So much more to offer  But would he have been able  To offer that sober  Of course  Well that's Doug's point  That's all I'm saying  Yes  Because again  We're not  When you're a kid 
[02:28:30]  So nobody you know  That's gut sober  And became unfunny  Oh dude  I'm not saying  That that doesn't happen  I'm not saying  It doesn't happen  The other way too  How many fucking  Great minds  Fucking get  Shit canned by this  And start to suck  And their careers  Going nowhere  So it kind of  Works both ways  I completely agree  With you there  But it's not  Just one way  But when Mitch  Was a kid  Growing up  Or any comics  A kid growing up  You're not drunken  On heroin  The whole time  It makes you  Who you are  Your personality  That thing about  Being funny  Maybe you lose  Inhibitions  When you're high  And maybe you lose 
[02:29:00]  A lot of this  But Mitch still  Would have been funny  Fucking with hallucinogens  Really  I give so much  Credit to that  And I would  Like  Smoking is a  Problem that  I wish I'd never done  That's maybe  The one regret  I wish I never  Started smoking  There's no payoff  To it  But I would  Encourage  Kids  Teenagers  Under controlled  Circumstances  Fuck with hallucinogens  It really  That made my head  So wide open 
[02:29:30]  Coming from  A Worcester place  And that small  Shithead mentality  Where  It really  Opened me up  So much  And  Ecstasy  Back when you  Could count on  The purity of it  Taught me so much  Love  And  Introspection  Yeah  Alcohol is a  Pointless thing  But I enjoy it  It works for me  I can make it work  Yeah  Like a diet  And cigarettes  Are point  But yeah  Fucking hallucinogens  Like  Hedberg 
[02:30:00]  Really stretched  His brain out  And yeah  Heroin fucked him  Yeah  I haven't tried it  Yet  But I'll wait  Till everything's  Falling apart  And give it a shot  Give it a shot  When it's  Yeah  When it's the  Fucking final stretch  And I'm in  Last place  When everything  That it could  Fuck up  Is already  Fucked up  Yeah  Yeah  What do you got  To lose  Yeah  A live Mitch  Performing  And creating  Fucking brilliant  Is better than  A dead Mitch  It's the bottom  I mean it sounds  Simple and stupid  But that's what  It comes down to  All the intellectualizing 
[02:30:30]  All the brilliance  Means zero  Mitch is smart enough  To say what you're saying  He was a smart enough  Guy to figure that out  And all of the  Knowledge about that  Mitch was like  One of the few guys  Early in my  When I was  Even stupid  That I go  This guy is  Light years ahead of me  Spiritually  Intellectually  He laughed at all of us  I'm like  This guy knows  That we're a goof  Then why couldn't  All of that  Fucking smart  And all of that  Genius  Stop what happened  Because he didn't  Really want to 
[02:31:00]  Hang around with us  But do you know  What I'm saying  Like that's  Maybe we weren't  That important  To Mitch  That life was that  You're  You're putting  A value on living  Sure  That other people  Might not share  I don't buy that  I don't  I believe that we  Nobody just  I mean people  Come in suicide all the time  Yeah  But I think that people  Put a certain value on it  I mean come on  It's  In the moment  Yeah if someone  Has a gun to your head  But in the  Like do I  I really  Again 
[02:31:30]  People who don't want  Children  Like hey  What's the point  Can I jump in for a second  What's the value though  Living a really long life  Or a short one  That is packed with some  Right  Some amazing shit  Amazing shit  Yeah but being  Fucking stoned  And missing gigs  And falling apart  At the end  Which is what was  Happening to him  It said to me  That that happened  And I guarantee  He didn't overdose  On purpose  There are people  That commit suicide  But I don't believe  He overdosed on purpose  And as smart as he is  And he was  And he was  He could not  Control that 
[02:32:00]  The word on the street  The inside  Fucking Perez Hilton  For the record out there  Drug users  Was it wasn't actually  The heroin that killed him  It was the downers  Coming off of it  Prescription shit  So yeah  Remember that  Prescription drugs  Are really the most dangerous  Which sucks for me  Because again  I enjoy a Xanax  When I can get one  Right  And all these  Fucking celebrities  Dying of them  Is going to make them  Illegal  Do you think you're addicted? 
[02:32:30]  No no  Actually I've stopped  Taking Xanax  For months  I mean to booze  Or to any of it  Alcohol I'm worried about  Because I watch a lot  Of intervention for fun  On an off night  I'll open a bottle  Of red wine  And go I'm not  Drinking tonight  I'm just drinking wine  And we're going to watch  Intervention  Right right  But you can  Like the amount  That I drink  Over the course of time  That I've drank  Even when I stop drinking  For a few days  When I'm quitting smoking  I quit smoking  For three weeks  Most of three weeks  I'll still drink  A few drinks a night 
[02:33:00]  Because you do have  The chance  That you can have seizures  If you quit immediately  But if you want to stop  If it's so easy  To intellectualize it  I'm not saying forever  But why not  Give yourself a break  Just to fucking  Fucking you know  Give your body a chance  To chew up a little bit  But for the first few days  I will have a couple of drinks  Just because  I don't want to take a chance  Of  I don't know  You don't know  The problem with the whole  War on drugs thing  Is they put so much  Bullshit into it  You can't  Glean any reasonable 
[02:33:30]  Medical advice  When they have the fucking  There's oh pot leads to this  And you go  No I know  Everyone that smoked pot  For a hundred fucking years  I know you're lying  So okay  Where's the truth come in  With your PSAs  There's so much bullshit  Against drugs  That all right  I watch people  Okay this guy died  On intervention  Because he went into a seizure  Because he tried to quit  Cold turkey  All right  I'll have a couple of drinks  Just to make sure  But I'm still fine  Not drinking  In circumstances 
[02:34:00]  Yeah  So why go back to it  I can make my own rehab  Why go back to it  Because I like drinking  Okay  Drinking is  I know I definitely get that  And that's fine  Somebody enjoyed it  I love the whole culture  I love the glasses  I buy fucking glasses online  I like rocks glasses  I like bars  Exactly  The ritual of it  Is what's happening  Because of it worth it  If it is  Then cool  Like and I'm not asking that  With a definitive answer  Is  Because you know  What's happening  Physically when you do it  Like you understand  What's happening to the body  To the liver  And how the older we get  The harder it gets to stop 
[02:34:30]  And the fucking more damage  It does for real  Is the trade-off worth it  If it is  Then you just enjoy it  But if it's not  If deep down  You're like  I probably shouldn't be doing this  The only way you can tell that  For sure  Is to live 46 years sober  To see if it's better  What's the trade-off  I don't know  But I mean  You know if you're feeling well  Like you know  If I'm not feeling well  I know I'm not feeling well  If my body is not good  I know my body is not good  So I mean  Are you feeling  If you feel fine  Then you feel fine  If you feel like  This is taking a toll 
[02:35:00]  Then  Well that's anything  I ate too much gravy  I fucking love gravy  Why would you eat a potato  Nobody eats gravy  Nobody blacks out eating gravy  Nobody  Very few people  You know what I mean  Beat their family  When they're eating gravy  It's the penalty  I don't do that  What about the hangovers  Don't do that drunk either  What about the hangovers dog  Are they just brutal  You just deal with it  But morning feels the same regardless  I've realized  60% minimum 
[02:35:30]  Of a hangover  Is cigarettes  Because when I drink  I fucking chain smoke  And I'm just outside  Looking at my friends  Through a window  And when I stop smoking  I feel so much better  No matter how drunk I was  Really  So I realize  How much of the hangover  Is cigarettes  I just fucking  I decided like  Probably three weeks ago  Just to fucking  Stop drinking  I just stopped  Not because  I'm like  I'm never going to drink  Again  Or might not  I don't know  I'm not 
[02:36:00]  I didn't put any  Goal on this thing  But it was more like  Alright  Since I started drinking  As a kid  I've never stopped  I never took a breather  Never  And I wanted to see  If it would be  Like  Oh  I stopped  But alright  This is cool  Or if I'd be  I didn't drink  Like  Crazy  Because I didn't know  What the result  You don't do this  Drunk  I've been drunk  My entire career  I've done this  Very drunk  When I'm sober 
[02:36:30]  I go into  Managerial mode  Where I'm so worried  About  Alright  Did you get the guest list  And are these people  Coming in on time  And is everyone seated  Like my head  I would be on stage  Going  These people need a drink  My head is completely  Trying to take over  The room  And control everything  And when I  I have cocktails  Then I can get into my act  And I really  I've tried to do  Comedy sober  And I suck  I fucking suck  I really do 
[02:37:00]  Maybe you do it  For a little while  Because your  Your mind is different  I might overcome it  Yeah  Of course you would  I mean you're  You're a funny dude  And your mind works  Really interesting  And has nothing to do  With the drinking  Drinking just lowers  The inhibitions  And you can say things  Not give a fuck  But that doesn't make  Anybody smarter  It doesn't make  Anybody more interesting  No it doesn't make you smarter  And I need my  Inhibitions to be  Because otherwise  I'm overwhelmed  With control freak  The whole environment  That girl's on her cell phone  She's texting  Is that person filming  Like I am  Like there's nothing  In my head  And I  Whatever it is 
[02:37:30]  That that is  You would find a way  To make that part  Of your brain  Work really well  For you too  So it wouldn't matter  It wouldn't affect you  Or I could have a drink  Have some cocktails  I can afford it now  Or I could just  Fucking have a cocktail  Should we change the subject  There's people out there  That don't drink  That are so bored  That's why I like  I like Dr. Drew  I'll tell you what  There's two  The schools of thought  But I'm not trying  To tell anybody  That their school of thought  Is wrong  Do what you gotta do  Fuck Dr. Drew  There's two different ways  Of looking at this  In the room right now  You fucking sycophant  Here's why I like Dr. Drew  Here's why I like him 
[02:38:00]  Oh that's right  This started with Dr. Drew  Yeah because you asked  Why I like him  Here's why I like him  I think that  The odds of most people  Staying sober are very low  It's the reality  And I really do think  That the way to get people  To pay attention to something  Is through celebrities  And this shit happens anyway  That's what our TV culture is  Is like  If you want people  To look at something  You put celebrities in  But if you're using  A bad template  Of what will work  For you  AA is  Fucking  There's statistics  Out there 
[02:38:30]  Where AA  Is the same  Or less  Than  Just cold turkey  I'm gonna do it myself  You may be right  I've never read that  But maybe you're right  But again  Maybe that's correct  I don't say that  AA is the only thing  That would work for people  If you can quit cold turkey  And just be  Go ahead  There's no  There's no  Like  This is the way to do it  This is the product  We're selling  If it works for you  Cool  If cold turkey  Works for somebody  Cool  But I don't think  Dr. Drew  Is committing this  Cultural crime 
[02:39:00]  By just showing people  Going through this process  That God is going to fix you  That's  Again  The only way you can work  AA  Is through believing in God  That's  That's why they say  It doesn't work  For smart people  That's completely  Incorrect  Eight out of the twelve steps  Are God related  I had to  Give up my life  And turn my will  And my power  Over to a higher  A power greater than yourself  Pull him up  But they also say  That there are plenty  There are plenty of people  Who are sober  Who do not believe 
[02:39:30]  In a deity  Of any kind  Who have great  Productive sober lives  As good as anybody else  There's no difference  In the way they do it  Then you're not  Working the steps  Because the steps  Tell you  You have to believe  In a God  Of course they don't  Tell you that  Of course they don't  I'm going to read them  To you  You can  But they don't  There are no  You have to do anything  We admitted  We were powerless  Over our addiction  That our lives  Had become unmanageable  Do you agree with that  For yourself  No  I'm not powerless 
[02:40:00]  That's the  That's what's fucked up  About you  Giving credit to this  When you're a smart person  That overcame this  Yourself  Because you're  Smart had nothing  To do with it  Mitch was a smart guy too  But he decided  To go a different direction  It's the same  Different direction  It's the same  Okay  It's a joke  Of fucking  The sports player  Who gives the credit  To God  When they win  I thank God  But they don't  Give themselves  Any credit  I get that point  But that's  I don't think  That's the same  We came to believe  That a power 
[02:40:30]  Greater than ourselves  Could restore us  To sanity  That's what you have  To believe  Is a power  Greater  No  Hold on  One thing at a time  It doesn't say  You have to believe  It doesn't say  We came to believe  It's an experiential thing  We came  To believe  So if you're an atheist  And you did not have  Some conversion  Of spirituality  Where you came  To believe  In a power  Greater than yourself  What if you believe  Rightly  That you're the greatest  Power in your own  Life  That you have 
[02:41:00]  You can manifest  Your own destiny  Well then  Good for you  Knock yourself out  Made a decision  To turn our will  And our lives  Over to the care  Of God  As we understand  God  What if you understand  That God  Is the silliest belief  A fucking human being  Can have  I believe in Batman  As well  You have not shown me  One thing where it says  You have to believe anything  These are the 12 steps  We made a decision  To turn it over  To the care of God  As we understood 
[02:41:30]  If you want AA to work  You have to believe that  That's simply  The as we understood  Is the important part  A lot of people  For them  Their higher power  I'm telling you  I mean I live this too  Their higher power  Is not a deity  No they believe in  Either the power  Of the group  Or something  Alright now I'm going  To have to quote  My own bit  That I just remembered  Is okay  I believe that  I am my only  Higher power  Therefore I'm turning  My will  Over to yourself  To myself 
[02:42:00]  And I want to cock  In all honesty  If that works for you  And it helps you  Not drink  Nobody would say  I'm not arguing that  You can't do that  I'm arguing that  This program  Tells you that  The belief in God  Is the only way  To work this program  I'm not talking about  What works for me  I'm talking about  They're not talking  About God  As a God  In heaven  Or a God  They're not talking  About that  Because obviously  There's a lot of people  That would never  Get sober  If that was forced  Down their throat  Never  They wouldn't do it  The belief in a God 
[02:42:30]  Is silly  I'm not even talking  About one that has  Backstories  You're saying  You don't think  That you're saying  I'm talking about  Any God  That there's anything  That could be a God  The idea of God  You're saying  You don't like the idea  That a power  That you need to find  Some kind of a thing  Greater than yourself  Even if it's the group  What if it's the group  Some people say  They use the group  And I really know people  That have done that  God  Group of drunks  That's all I can do  I don't believe in fucking God  I don't believe in any type of religion  You're going to turn 
[02:43:00]  Your will  Over to a group  Meaning  So you're like  Okay  Hey what should I do  About my finances  In a weird way  A bunch of guys smoking  Divot faces in AA  Fucking halls  In a bingo hall  I'm going to turn my power  And my will over to you  In a weird way  But it does work for people  That's what works for people  Who don't believe  In a deity  Hypnosis worked for  Louis Black  Quitting smoking  For a couple of years  For a couple of years  But it worked for a lot of people  There's no way to explain 
[02:43:30]  To somebody  Who's actively drinking  Let's get back to Dr. Drew  Because now we're just  Infighting  But I'm not even fighting with you  But I want to trash Dr. Drew  I think it's a very interesting discussion  When I want to trash Dr. Drew  As a person  You I love  Alright  But I  Yeah  Dr. Drew  But you can't say  That you have to believe in God  Because it tells  But it does not say  You have to do anything  It does not say  Once  Admitted to God  To ourselves  And to another human being  The exact nature  Of our wrongs  This is where  Scientology 
[02:44:00]  One-upped  Fucking Catholicism  Christianity  Christianity  Christianity would get you  They have confession  For a reason  Because once you've told someone  You feel indebted to them  Like oh shit  They know what I fucked up  And I fucked that guy's wife  And I said it  So now  It's the  It's a cult process  Scientology went one better  And that's why they have  That whole system of  They video you  It's either that  Wait wait wait wait  This is important  Scientology gets you 
[02:44:30]  To say it on tape  Yeah  So that's why you have  Travolta's  And fucking Tom Cruise's  That Travolta wanted to leave  And they're like  Whoa whoa whoa  That auditing we did  We have it on tape  That's how you got to the next level  I like sucking the occasional cock  I was in a sauna  I was in a sauna once  That doesn't seem smart  This is just about  Getting rid of your fucking shame  This is just about  Getting all those  They say we're as sick as our secrets  And it's like  The stuff that you hold in  That is secretive 
[02:45:00]  Is what you feel bad about  This is just about  Telling another human being  That trusting another person  And getting it off your chest  You're not that unique  Indoctrination into fucking Christianity  I swear to God  It's absolutely not an indoctrination  To anything  You tell somebody  It can be your doctor  They don't care who it is  It can be a stranger  Nobody says  It must be a member  Of this organization  It can be  Well no that's  What's up is that  Where you have to go back  To all the people  And fucking apologize  Oh yeah it says 
[02:45:30]  Made direct amends  To such people  Made a list of all people  Yeah I know that's a terrible thing  Made a list of all people  We had harmed  And became willing  To make amends to them all  That means  For all of the bullshit  I have pulled  And the damage I have done  I'm fucking owning up to it  And I'm saying  I'm sorry  Everyone  Except in those cases  Hold on  Except in those cases  Where to do so  Would injure them or others  So it's not go back  And tell  Hey Bill I fucked your wife  Because that would injure  Bill's wife  Or possibly you  You use common sense with it  But it's about fucking 
[02:46:00]  Just cleaning up your garbage  And your wreckage  I think  I understand what Doug's saying  In that  The way God is worded  In here  It seems to be  A little more of a leap  On your part  That you're interpreting it  To mean anything  Well it's come  It's come that way over the years  Because again  Of course it was based  A lot of it on Catholicism  And Catholic teaching  It was written  In the fucking 30's  And the 40's  That's where  That's where  Trailer for sales  Every time  Every time I think  About Bill W  But that's where  Yeah but Bill tried 
[02:46:30]  Hallucinogenics  Bill W was a woman  I just picture him  As Ryan O'Neill  In Paper Moon  Every time I think  Of Bill W  I love that movie  Door to door  Bible salesman  In the dust bowl  In fucking Oklahoma  And checking into  During the depression  Yeah I mean  Sorry that was off topic  That's fine  I never saw it  I don't even remember  What I was saying  Good one  The interpretation  Of God  Yeah I understand that dude  And I was fucking 18  When I got sober  You think that  I fucking 
[02:47:00]  I was believing in God  I don't  No  I still have a hard time  With higher power  I still struggle with that shit  But it seems like  Anything else  Like a big  Biblical scripture  And other type of rules  That they've loosened  Over the years  That it's like  Well that's open  To interpret  The constitution  That's open to interpretation  The constitution  Separation of church  And state  This is one of  The biggest breaches  Is people who get  A DUI  Sentenced to go  To AA meetings  Where they're forced  To believe in God  For six weeks  But that's 
[02:47:30]  That's the fucking  They're just trying  To get people  To do something  So they don't  Run families over  They should do something  Other than AA  They can  I can't have a judge  Sentence someone  To go to AA  Where the fucking  Okay  You don't have to  Go to AA  You can take  The jail sentence  For getting the DWI  You don't have to  Go to AA  Or any place  It's still bullshit  Why?  You've given  You can't fucking  Tell someone  That church is an option  You're right  So people should be  Forced to just  Go to jail  Fair  I'll go with that  I would go 
[02:48:00]  That far with you  Okay  As long as they  Did something wrong  While they were  Driving drunk  You fucking don't  Put someone in jail  For the  Unless they did  Something wrong  Oh you don't like  The fact that  You won't have  Gun it  You could have  Fucking killed  Someone with that  You're fucking  Going to jail  Well the idea  Drunk driving  Is the crime though  Just doing  Even though you've  Done nothing wrong  By drunk driving  It's kind of  A douche bag move  But the libertarian  Side of my head  Says well if you're  Good at drunk driving  At the same time  Again these are  Bits I've done 
[02:48:30]  A million years ago  But an elderly  Person in Florida  Is fucking  Completely legal  Licensed  And uncoordinated  Then you have  A NASCAR driver  Shit faced  That can  I want to  Fucking you guys  Do this  You have a radio show  You can make this happen  I've wanted to do it  Set up an obstacle course  In a parking lot  Somewhere  With a 90 year old  Sober guy  Versus a fucking  Well reflexed  Guy with cones  And make them do  The same  Him shit faced  Old guy sober 
[02:49:00]  And see who  Let's do that  Don't be lazy  It really is a good one  We might have to  Finally do a radio bid  Hold them to the fire  Doug I've tried  Over the years  To promote this  Where the state  Has drunk drivers  Licenses  That's the bit  This is  Oh okay  This is a fucking  15 year old  Bit on a CD  You take a test  Right  A drunk driver  Yeah  And you get  Your limit  Is on  0.17  Right  It's on a CD  Wow it is  Okay yeah yeah  I've thought that  For years  Myself  Listen or call 
[02:49:30]  And tell me  What CD that's  Yes I mean  That would be great  You just fucking  You pass for a certain  Blood alcohol level  The same as your  Contact lenses  I'm a minus 300  In my contact lenses  That's what I have to  Have in my head  To drive  I like that idea  It's  You can drive  I've only had like  14 really good points  In my career  And they're on CDs  And I'll tell you something  And no one listens  The past fucking  Almost like three weeks  That I haven't been drinking  I've been the worst driver 
[02:50:00]  When I've driven  To and from  My brother's house  Parties  I take my Mustang out  Where I normally  Would take the Escalade  I'm driving 140 miles an hour  Down the expressway  I'm weaving in and out of lanes  Meanwhile if I was  If I had been drinking  I'd be center lane  10 and 2  Cruise control on  Barely over the speed limit  And drive home very nicely  I'm a shitty driver  I never drink and drive  At all  Yeah  Under any circumstances  Because I know  I'm just a shitty driver  Anyway  Oh okay  So I just don't  I'm very good at drunk driving 
[02:50:30]  It's the same reason  I don't own a gun  Very good  Because I'm  I have small man complex  I get really angry  I can see shooting someone  In a fucking long  State of mind  Like oh fuck you  I can get away with  Oh no I shouldn't have done that  That's an odd thing  Because when I get mad  Like and I get fucking mad  On the road  Like people piss me  The fuck off  When I'm driving  And I'll yell  You fucking piece of shit  But I never ever  It never even crosses my mind  To go to my gun  To like pull out my gun  And fucking wave it  At someone's face  That's why you own a gun 
[02:51:00]  I'm responsible  You would wave it around  Motherfuck  I can get into a state  Of where I think  Oh I'm being attacked  I think I'm being  Well no I'm just saying  Right right right  I understand his point  I hear you  I go down the street  Now he's outside of my house  And I know he's a tweaker  Well now he's just walking by  But I think he's casing my joint  Like I can see  How it would develop  Probably not  But it's best  I don't have a gun  Okay that's responsible  It's best I just apologize 
[02:51:30]  In the morning  For being a fucking asshole  That's responsible  That's good  I don't really have a case here  I don't think everyone  Should be armed either  Kirshner  Give me  Tell me what developed  As my attorney  Yeah yeah  What might have developed  Because I shot a guy  And he probably didn't deserve it  Yeah make up a good story please  Doug we gotta break  Just cause we have a lot of live reads  For fucking Mother's Day  So  Doug's gonna continue with us  My mother's dead  Ha ha  Mom died right  When  Yeah she killed herself

The last time I was here  Fucking dice came in  Alright  And just lit up a cigarette  And put control of the room  Motherfucker  What a pain in the ass he was  Oh really?  Yeah cause he went to the vents  Went to the vents  It was pouring out into other studios  I actually did a pilot  I guess you'd call it  A try wannabe radio show for Sirius 
[02:55:00]  And it was late at night  And I'm smoking and drinking  I'm like fuck this  Oh shit  Yeah I didn't  Was it here?  Yeah in the studio somewhere  Late at night  I would listen to you on the radio  Huh?  I think Di Stefano did it with me  Oh yeah?  Did he really?  Yeah I think he was like my  How long ago was that?  Whatever happened to that guy?  He had a heart attack  He died  Oh Di Stefano  No I was  Oh my god  Oh my god  I'm so sorry  It's one of those things that  No I'm thinking the other  I'm stealing from Norton 
[02:55:30]  Which was  The whole  The Colin Quinton show  Tough crowd  That whole stupid  You fucking stupid  It's you guys  It's like  Every time I say stupid  I'm like  I'm stealing from Jim Norton  You're not though  It's like  I know  It's a great word  It doesn't get a lot of use  But I say  There's scenes  Where people say  Oh Andy Andrist  Is trying to be like you  No we're friends  And we talk the same  Like there was a culture  When I started in Phoenix  There was a culture  Of the David Spade 
[02:56:00]  And everyone had that  Ron Morey  And Pablo  Pablo wasn't really part of that  But yeah  They all kind of talked the same  Because they hung out  They all hung out together  Sorry I'm kind of out of breath  You're right though  We had a fucking moment  In the elevator  Yeah  Worst business card ever  Tell me who that is  Uh  Gypsy Joe something  I can't even read  Your business card  Gypsy Joe Hawking  It's written in a darker font  It was a band  That was somewhere  In the building 
[02:56:30]  They just did a radio show  We got on the elevator together  And they had their equipment  I go  Hey how about a number  And they burst into song  On the whole  It was fucking beautiful  It's caught on tape somewhere  Uh oh  Please  Yeah  She was there  Better be on tape  Yes  I do an elevator show now  I could have used that one  Gaze on for Sirius Radio  Was there  And he started filming  Oh right on  And the whole 36 floors  You really gotta hold on me  Wow  And it ended perfectly 
[02:57:00]  As the doors opened  At the ground floor  And I'm like  That was fucking magic  Oh wow  Absolute magic  Yeah  Fuck  But they did  They just immediately  Plugged in  They had an amp  That you could plug into  Remote  And just fucking  Burst in a song  That's beautiful  The doors opened  A couple times  People walked into  A concert on the elevator  I do an elevator show  That's exactly  What I'm looking for  Oh man  I could have used that  Is there an actual tape of it  If I was a younger comic  I'd go  Hey can we go up  So I can do a set  On the way up 
[02:57:30]  And we'll go down again  Not a bad idea though  That's a good one  That would work  Comedy doesn't work like that  Well that's why  That's why it would be good  The back of someone's head  That's really awkward  That's why it would be really good  Oh sorry  You're getting off of this floor  So what happened to your mom  What can you tell us  I know you don't want to give away  The whole bit  She was dying of emphysema  Right  And  She was a lifetime smoker  Yeah  Cool milds  Back when they made them  And then generics at the end  Some shitty brand  But yeah  She was drowning in her own fluids 
[02:58:00]  Yeah  Had a cash out  But she was sober  Yeah  I don't know if that was off the air  I asked only because  You had said that she was sober  So I was hoping that she would be sober  For like 20 something years  And then somewhere  I think  2003  4  Whenever the man show was  I found out she had started drinking again  And she hadn't told me  She was hiding it from me  And then  I know it was the man show  We were doing wraparounds  For the Comedy Central  The Commie Awards 
[02:58:30]  Remember they tried to do an award show  Yeah I do  And we filmed wraparounds on a cruise ship  So I took her on a cruise ship with me  I was working  And she was drunk and gambling  I knew she was drinking  And they flew as first class  Which at that point  I've never even  Ooh first class  Ooh the big seats  And they had champagne  They'd bring out  Oh  So I like  Ma you want champagne with me  Like  So she could  I knew she was drinking  But she didn't know I knew  Stop hiding this please  Yeah 
[02:59:00]  Stop sneaking  Yeah so we got hammered  And it was great  And she just gambled the whole time  A woman who  In real life  Oh I'm too  I'm too tired  To bring my fucking groceries upstairs  Oh but you can gamble  For 72 hours  Straight  Like I've fallen asleep  Past  You're still at the slot machine  You have that  Yeah  It really is an amazing thing  When you're gambling  You know  Round the clock  It's like cocaine for me  It could just go  Round the clock  And meanwhile  If I was home  I'd have taken 50 naps already 
[02:59:30]  And uh  But I could sit at a table  If I get on a gambling jag  I really  I'll chew through my cheek  Like I do  When you do coke  And you're just  Jawing  Yeah yeah  It's the exact  It has to be the same  Chemical  Dopamine  Or whatever the fuck it is  That your body sends out  And it goes  And I can stay up  For fucking four days  Just to beat this chink  That'll be  That'll be a big test  If I drink or not  At a blackjack table  That'd be tough  Because let me tell you  I've made some  Pretty good money  Because 
[03:00:00]  I was betting a lot  Because  I was drunk  Right  But I  That would actually  Be a good rehab  I've tried to figure out  My own rehab  If I wanted to quit  Everything  Jet skis  It boils down to  Jet skis  Really  I remember  In the early days  Where I could not  Imagine  Going  More than  15 minutes  Without a cigarette  That's why I started  Taking Xanax  On planes  To sleep  For the entire flight  Because you wanted to smoke 
[03:00:30]  It's torture to not smoke  On a flight  Right  But there was a time  Where I was going through  Lake Powell  In Arizona  On my way to Colorado  Driving  And I had time to kill  And I rented a jet ski  By myself  For two hours  And I just  Zipped around  It was fucking late  It was fantastic  Yeah  And I go  I never wanted  A cigarette once  For two hours  I never thought  Oh I gotta stop  Jet skiing  To have a cigarette  Right  And that's the  Nebulous 
[03:01:00]  If you wanted to quit something  And not think about it  Well what is it  About jet skiing  Like the whole  What is it about that head space  And how do you  Make that  Into something  That  You just gotta jet ski  Eight hours a day  Or just make people  Stay on the water  All the time  Yeah  Oh yeah  Just fucking  Plan some kind of heist  Like heat  With Robert De Niro  They didn't  Oh fuck  Yeah I'm gonna shoot out  With the cops  And Kevlar  I need a cigarette 
[03:01:30]  Yeah you're not thinking about it  You would think  That's a time  You would want a cigarette  Probably  But they didn't think about that  No  Those guys that actually  Did the heat heist  In LA  With the Kevlar helmets  That's an amazing scene  It's fucking fantastic  I need to know  I need to know  I bet they were smokers  I need to know  How your mom killed herself  Pills  She went with the pills  Morphine  Oh wow  I don't want  It's one of those stories  Where you don't want to do the bit  But the bit is the story  Right right right  I think it's just an interesting story  I'm sure  She knew it was time 
[03:02:00]  And we knew  She was gonna get to a point  She wouldn't stop smoking  In fact we had quit smoking  For almost a year  At that point  And we  We had a last cigarette  With mother  With mother  When she was killing herself  Oh my god  Wait were you around  When she did it  Yeah  I was around  Again there's legalities  Where you go  Right right right  Hey this is a bit by the way  It's just comedy  Sure  Yeah you don't know  Let's just say this  Were you shocked  That she took pills 
[03:02:30]  Or maybe did you suspect  No no no  Well no  You have to help  Some people move  Yeah  Someone's gonna move  And you have a pickup truck  You gotta help  Someone's your mother  They're gonna kill themselves  You have to like  Do some research  I didn't buy her a shotgun  Yeah yeah  You don't want to clean that up  I love the suicide  So much as bar back it  Because at that point  That's where we were  She was  She had been four years sober  At the end  She went off  Oh good  And she went  Again an ugly drunk  Like she left a suicide 
[03:03:00]  Not even a note  But a post it  We had a  We moved to Arizona  I said ma  We're gonna get settled in  We'll move you out  She can't be in LA  By herself  She was like  She was 63  Her head was around  She just  Her body was failing  Yeah yeah  She was weak emotionally  So  She called up  Like a  Month and a half  After we moved to Arizona  Like  Warbly  Drunk  I don't take it 
[03:03:30]  I don't want to  Buy my burden  I'm gonna kill myself  So we have to drive  Nine and a half hours  To LA  In the middle of the night  Get there in the morning  She had a suicide post it  Doug  I still have it  Doug  Pain is too much  Wow  That's it  Not even a whole letter  Wow  Wow  Yeah  So we get her out there  So she rehabbed  But when she was gonna kill herself  I'm going  You're not gonna do this sober  That's dumb  Yeah yeah 
[03:04:00]  If you're ready to make this choice  I'll  You know  I'll accommodate that  Yeah  She's fucking  Drowning alive  How did she tell you  She was gonna kill herself  Was it a phone call  No it was  We know what's gonna happen  She's either gonna die  Or kill herself  Right  She'd been life flighted  To Tucson twice  Where they put  Like a suction thing  Into your lungs  Yeah  She was so addicted  To painkillers  At that point  That when I went to see her  I had one time  We had to fly back  From Costa Rica  They go  Your mom's been life flighted 
[03:04:30]  The first time  And I went to see her  At TMC  And she's got the thing  Down in her lungs  She can't talk  There's a tube  In her fucking mouth  And she writes down  Vicodin  And I'm like  What am I gonna put him  In the tube  And she nods  Like that's not really  An option  Wow  Holy fuck  And she was not  As stupid  You've met my mother  She was lovely  Yeah  She was in Vail  The first time  Yeah  Fucking crazy  Truck driver mouth  Everyone thought  She's adorable  Oh your mother  Swears like a truck driver 
[03:05:00]  It's adorable  I remember a fucking  Quote from her  At Vail  And I think  You were at the table  She always called you  He's like my son  I told him  One time  Yeah mom  He doesn't remember you  That was fucking  15 years ago  Wow  Oh James Inman  He's like my son  Yes mom  She uh  You and I  Shared a room  And uh  You had all of your  Possessions  That's my  My most defining  Memory of Doug  Is Doug  With all of his  Possessions  On his bed 
[03:05:30]  Like he wouldn't  Put anything  I lived  I didn't have a home  I lived out of my car  So yeah  You bring your shit in  Wow  You just bring it in  In doors  But not even in the drawers  Yeah it was just  All on the bed  Just laid out  Yeah  Wow that is a  95  That's a fascinating  Story with your mom  That's amazing  And then you guys  Were around that  Actual day or  Yeah yeah  Well she came to the house  And we  I laid down ground rules  And this is in the bit  But it's true  I said  Cause she had balked  At suicide so many times  Over her life 
[03:06:00]  Just you know  For  Need  For someone  Hey I'm gonna  She tried to kill herself  Like with aspirin  Or whatever  When she was young  She'd talk about  But uh  So  I know it's serious  But at the same time  Is this a ploy  Just to get  Sure  Over to my house  From your hoarder  Paradise  In the other side  Of Bisbee  Arizona  And so I said  If you're gonna  Kill yourself  For real  You can't do it  Sunday or Monday 
[03:06:30]  Cause that's football  It's an actual conversation  It's an actual conversation  If you can call your own time  To leave this fucking world  You don't do it  During someone else's party  On purpose  Just to be a dick  Right  And you have to do it  Two weeks from now  Cause that's when my manager  Is coming down  And he has no sense of humor  About  Oh your mother's gonna  Kill yourself  So  So  I gave her  A time period  Otherwise you go back to  Wow  And yeah  She killed herself  It was Thursday  She came in  She killed herself  On the Saturday night 
[03:07:00]  We watched Bad Santa together  Favorite movie  And  She choked down  90 morphine tablets  And the details  Wow  And we  Made up white Russians  So she's choking them down  With white Russians  We had a party  We fucking roasted her  We made fun of her  We made it into a goof  It was the most beautiful death  Like  You know  Ma wait  They found a cure  It's one of the jokes  But it was an actual quote  Holy  Actually like giving us the finger  Like laughing 
[03:07:30]  Holy shit  I'm blown away  Vacillating between  I was a bad mother  And then just laughing  And it was  Yeah  What did you think  The minute that she shut down  Like when she finally  Closed her eyes  And you knew it was done  Well  It's funny  Because we kind of  Shut down  Before she did  Completely  You passed out  A fucking 83 pound  63 year old woman  Fucking drank us  Under the table  Where  She's  She was gone  But she was still breathing 
[03:08:00]  Right  And then we start  Playing music  Which she hated music  But she's  Not there  She's not  Bitching about it  She's too far gone  So we crank up  Some counting crows  Fuck you  I like them  You do like the counting crows  And then we just  Like  Then who do you call  There's so many questions  Here  I don't know  I don't know  What you want to talk about  That's the saddest part  Is my mother  At 63  Had pushed so many  She hadn't  My  We called my brother  While she was doing it 
[03:08:30]  So she could say goodbye  He knows it's gonna happen  Well okay  It's actually happening  She calls my brother  Goodbye  And there was no one else to call  But I mean  There's so many people  Out of her life  By being such a miserablist  That there was nobody  How do you  How are you 63 years old  And you die  And there was no obituary  Or gravestone  We gave her body  To science  Whatever fucking  You know  Institution has the program 
[03:09:00]  Where you don't have  Because I'm not  Fucking burying someone  It's dumb  Paxton Massachusetts  Except for  Fucking Boston Bomber  We have a plot for you  Plug  So  Wait wait  It's my plug  I plug  DougStanupCelebrityDeathPool.com  Please  That's another whole story  Most fun I've ever had  Gambling  But that's  DougStanup  Go find that  And yeah  Wait wait wait  So now your mom's dead  So who you call the next day  Oh to take care of the business 
[03:09:30]  I don't know what you want to talk about  So shut me down anytime you want  No no  This is  These are  Like the story is so detailed  When I tried to make it into a bit  It was just  Alright  Now there's 20 minutes of you  Talking about your dead mother  Get to the point  But that was one of the funny things  Bingo  That  She came to our house  And they set up a hospital bed  In hospice care  Set up a hospital bed  In the living room  So  And I had a friend  That would change her catheter  When I  Because I'm not touching  My mother's vagina 
[03:10:00]  Right  No  I don't have  Oh  I gave birth to you  Well I didn't ask you to  Yeah  Fuck you  I'll get someone to do it  Plus who needs to fucking realize  At that moment  Like wow  This is fantastic  8.2% unemployment rate  In Cochise County  I can find someone  To fucking change a Foley bag  A Foley bag  So  So  When she's gone  But she's still  Breathing  Oh she's breathing  But she's gone  But she's breathing  And then  We've been drinking  White Russians with her 
[03:10:30]  And we'd already taken Xanax  Before  She decided  It's time to go  Uh huh  And we're like  Oh fuck  Finally we pass out  And  A caretaker called  The  The paramedics  Of  A hospice patient  Has died  The  Paramedics came in  And tried to take  Bingo's body  Cause she's passed out  On the couch  We have an L shaped couch  So I'm on one side  Of the L  She's on the other  My mother's in a  Hospital bed  And they go directly  To Bingo  Thinking she's a corpse  Holy shit 
[03:11:00]  And  I don't want to say her name  But the caretaker's like  Um  It's  Her  And they were  Outside like  Like  In  Like sheer  Blushing embarrassment  That they accidentally  Went for  The living girl  Yes  Wow  So  Yeah  Anyway  Caretaker stayed up  Through the night  Till she was dead  We were just like  Alright I'm tired  Of waiting for it  I'll crash  She'll be dead  At some point  I'll wake up  So we woke up  To the paramedics  Taking her out  But emphysema 
[03:11:30]  Would have been  That's why  Kevorkian  I mean  It was  To be merciful  You're drawing  Your own fluids  What exactly  I mean  I know  It's like  Being waterboarding  It just stops  Your lungs  From working  They can't pump  The fluids anymore  You can breathe  But there's no oxygen  Getting into your system  Right  Yeah  Just gums up  Your fucking  Adema  Right  I guess  I  I think  It's an awful death  My dad  My dad was heading  That way  And he ended up  Dying in a car accident  But he was heading  Toward you know  Drowning in his own fluids  That's what I'm hoping for  Car accidents 
[03:12:00]  Because your heart  Your heart's too weak  To pump out everything  And you start getting swollen  And all that shit  It's horrible  Horrible way to go man  I quit 10 years ago  I fucking  I just had a moment  Of clarity  On the radio show  And fucking  I went down  To the comedy cellar  We were still smoking back then  And Esty  Who ran the cellar  I'm like  I'm gonna quit smoking  And she marched me  To the fucking thing  And got me the patch  And for some reason  I did it the way  The patch suggested  Over 21 days  And it worked  Like I just drank  A lot of fucking water  And I put some weight on  But I'm fucking  Really happy 
[03:12:30]  You're really good  At following directions  Sometimes  You know what  With some things  I really am  With other things  I've been absolutely atrocious  The things I've followed  Directions on  You know  Miraculously  They worked  And I stopped doing  The things I did it my way  Well I'm still spending  You know  Fucking three grand a week  On fucking  Oh dude  No directions with them  So yeah  It's terrible  I'm so happy  I have no sex drive  What so ever  It's as freeing  As you not smoking  Or drinking  Yeah yeah yeah  Really nothing  I feel like not needing pussy  It's been a deficit 
[03:13:00]  When it comes to the act  What do you attribute that to?  Like I don't work as much  Because I don't feel the need  To be that good  What do you attribute  The lack of sex drive to?  What is it?  I have no idea  Really?  But it's  Yeah  Any with your girl  Or just in general?  No no  It's what  I don't want to say  Especially my girl  But my entire life  There's nothing  That's  More depressing  That I fucked you already  Like the whole thrill  Of pussy  For me  Was that I hadn't 
[03:13:30]  Like I got it  Like it was an accomplishment  It was knocking down  All the milk jugs  At the fucking carnival  You know  Right  Three balls for a dollar  Oh fucking  I got this one  With one ball  I fucking nailed this  You don't have to do it again  Exactly  But there was an emptiness  To the whole idea  Of fucking  I remember tripping  The only time I did  Mescaline in the desert  Where I'm thinking  It's so sad  When you're in love  With someone  And that's the first way  You want to show them  How much 
[03:14:00]  That you  I can't wait to  Just fucking jizz  All over your pubic regions  Like it's the most  Beautiful feeling  In your soul  To be in love  And the most  Disgusting way  To display it  Isn't there something else  We can do  Other than have a wedding  Some dumb shit  It really doesn't match up now  Does it  Just fucking  Loops some  Fucking  Scum  I love you so much  That I'm just gonna  Pump this fucking 
[03:14:30]  Fluid  Exactly  Some rubber cement  Into your belly button  I'm gonna cough up  Phlegm  And spit it  In an orifice  Of yours  Fucking  Stringy  You've earned  My spermatozoa  Yeah  My lumpies  My fucking  Stringy  What a great bit  Because then you realize  Like wow  I didn't love you at all  That's the worst  I think Joe Rogan  Used to call it  Post cum syndrome  Or something  But that  Yeah 
[03:15:00]  That feeling  As soon as you come  It's not even done  Spilling on you  And you're like  Oh  This is a  What did I  Oh I'm gonna  What was I  What was I  What was I  Watching on TV  Before this  Got started  Yeah  You're like  Because let me  Go right back  To the television  We got a  We got a  Great question  If Norton  And I  Just did that  Same load  Him on the  Pig's face  And me on her ass  And made eye contact  I'd run for a bottle  And he'd go to a  Meeting to share  And then he'd make  Amends with her  A few years later 
[03:15:30]  And just black it out  And we go on the air  Remember that one girl  No  I don't  I'd apologize for both of us  Like you know  Doug would say  He was sorry  If he was capable  We learned today  There's two ways  To look at it  Hey  Dane in Boston  Wants to know  Why comedians  Have addictive personalities  So many of the good ones  That's true  So many of the good ones  Do  I feel like it's such a  Remnant of the fucking 90's  Being  Even Attel  Quit drinking like  Five years ago  And that  Who's left  I think most comics  I know are addicted 
[03:16:00]  To something  And maybe part of it  Is that there's  A certain personality  Where you're always  Grabbing for shit  Whether it's information  Or whatever  But there's also  An availability  And an acceptance  Like with comics  Who's a comic  That's still fucked up  Not even fucked up  I'm saying  Addicted personality  Doesn't even mean  Just booze  A lot of them  Don't drink  But they still smoke  Or sexually  Or gambling  Right  Like most people  I know  Have something  Either in their past  Or in their present  And I think  Part of it is  Like nothing  Like we're having  This conversation  About drinking and stuff  But Doug's drinking vodka 
[03:16:30]  And in our job  I'm not like  Oh my god  Doug's drinking vodka  Like no one gives a fuck  It's a very accepted profession  To do almost anything you want  But why is that  But that's also  I think why a lot of people  Don't anymore  Like okay I did that  I don't do that anymore  Once I realized I could  Like when you can  There's a  Oh I can do that  It's like when you find out  You can smoke  In an airport  Nothing makes me want to  Stop quitting smoking  If I've quit  But you can smoke  Somewhere you shouldn't  Oh I'm gonna do it 
[03:17:00]  This time  I'm in Denver  They have a smoking  Lounge  I've come off  The fucking smoking wagon  But  I don't know any  How many comics  That aren't addicted to something  If they're not actively drinking  There's still alcoholics  Who have quit  I don't know any  That are fucking  Like I can think of  I know nothing  But sober comics  I saw Craig  Let's just say  A comic named Craig  And I was so happy  He was drinking last night  He's in the green room  I'm like  Oh I don't want to feel  Like a dick  Thank god somebody's drinking  Yeah  I can't think of one guy  I'm sure there's plenty 
[03:17:30]  But I just don't know any  That are close friends  Like Bob Kelly  Sober  I mean but he's still  You know  Tom Rhodes I know  Is still a fuck up  But he's  Oh is he drinking  Okay I don't know  He's a guy that  Oh thank god  Chris Rock  I've never  I don't know Chris that well  I know him casually  From the cellar  But I've never seen him  Doing anything  That I can think of  I've never heard  That he was a hard drinker  Or a gambler  Or anything  So unless he's got stuff  I just don't know  It used to be  Like when I'd come  To the city  I'd go to the cellar  And it  Because they have  A table outside  You could smoke  And I'd have cocktails 
[03:18:00]  And there'd be  Some comics  Hanging around drinking  And over the last  Four or five years  If I go down there  I'm just like  I'm like a homeless guy  I'm like  I'm busking  For a fucking  Drinking partner  Anyone  Anyone  Yeah come on  Make me feel better  About myself  Yeah  Colin  I don't know  How many years  I knew Colin  Peripherally  Where I'd go  Hey you want to do a shot  Or something  He goes  How many times  Do I have to tell you  I don't drink  I quit drinking  He's like  Yeah yeah  He just seems like  He seems like 
[03:18:30]  The kind of guy  That would be drinking  Colin has a still  Drinking voice  Yes  Like when you talk  To Colin  He has to be  Fucking  Drinking and smoking  He sounds like  Yeah yeah  He has a homeless guy voice  Keith Robinson drinks  At the cellar  There's not as many guys  Because people are getting older  So as people get older  Not even addicted people  Just the process of elimination  As you get older  Is people begin dropping dead  And that gives everybody  A fucking like mortality check  Like you know what I mean  Like Geraldo  It's like you know  Geraldo is a fucking  Vital brilliant comic  And like he's just gone 
[03:19:00]  And you're like oof  But he was one of those  Revolving door guys  Oh yeah man  As they call him  In the program  Where he'd go  Fucking completely rehab  And then  Like oh you're  Oh yeah you did  Used to be a lawyer  I see that in you  Yeah  And then  I never saw crazy him  But I do remember  I was really fucked up  At Montreal  One of the times  I did Just for Spite Festival  The first time  And fucking that  Cunt guy  That used to run it  He threw me  Out of a green room  Just  Long story  Okay  But yeah 
[03:19:30]  I was fucked up  And I just got chucked out  And I see Geraldo  And two other comics  And I'm drunk  But I was right  That's one of the problems  With being correct  But drunk  Is if you're drunk  And slurring  You look like you're wrong  Right  No matter what you're doing  But I was completely right  Just my motor skills  If I had cerebral palsy  And I explained the same story  I would get sympathy  But because I'm talking  Like this a bit  I'm slurring  But I was definitely right  And I had sober witnesses 
[03:20:00]  That corroborated  The next day  But I'm trying to tell  Geraldo what just happened  In this fucking green room  With I can't remember  That cunt's name  That guy that ran it  He'd come backstage  And give you notes  About your set  And passive aggressively  Tell you what you might  Do differently  Oh my god  You think this bit  Worked better  I'm a fucking  Fuck you  I'm a veteran  You cunt  I'm not taking your advice  I don't  I'm not a new face  Anyway  Geraldo went  That reminds me  Of why I went to rehab  And I'm like 
[03:20:30]  Alright  Don't fucking do that  To me  You fucking asshole  Just cause I'm  And then he died  And I took a little bit  Of  That's why I  Fucking  Yeah  That's why I went to rehab  Holy shit  If you were there  Last time I saw  Ron White  Ron White was there  Ron White is a comic  Who's still fucked up  And fantastic at it  Yeah  Very funny  Fucking  It rolls  It's like  Oh  I have a friend  In Bisbee  That looks exactly  Like Charles Bukowski 
[03:21:00]  Spitting image  And I have a friend  That I started comedy  With that lives in Seattle  That looks just like  Dr. Drew  And if I could put them  Together  If I knew that  My Bukowski friend  Could act  I'd love to  What would fucking  I think  We might have talked  About this  What would fucking  Dr. Drew say  To Hunter S. Thompson  Right  Right  Right  If you're fantastic  Like Ron White is  At  He's  He's made his disease  If he would  As you would call it  His art 
[03:21:30]  What would  Fucking  Dr. Drew say  To  Fucking Dean Martin  Um  I don't know  You can do this  It's a crutch  Like come on  Fucking look  At the icons  Of drug use  Abuse  Whatever you call it  Yeah  And what is  Dr. Drew  Gonna say  To that  You wanna see  That  To Hendrix  You wanna see  Fucking Hendrix  On fucking  Celebrity Rehab  Are you gonna say  Dr. Drew  Does have some  Good points here  Probably yeah  Cause he died  At 27 
[03:22:00]  So obviously  He didn't know  That much  Well  Exactly  And you go  You know what  Yeah  You're doing  Kind of pop  Now  But we still  Love you  Jimmy  Oh no  Yeah no  You could do that  Without the drugs  Okay  The new album's  A little soft  But it's okay  Cause it's better  To have you alive  Hendrix  Yeah  With Dr. Drew  But the thing is  Dr. Drew would be  A dick for doing that  If he went up to people  Who were performing  Right after a great show  And said hey hey hey 
[03:22:30]  Randomly tweeting  That Lindsay Lohan  He would have her arrested  You fucking wanna go  Dr. Drew  He fucking tweets  That if I  I would have her arrested  To save her from herself  Like saying set her up  And put her in prison  He's offering unsolicited advice  To stars all the time  Talking about them  He's on every fucking news show  Talking about  Oh this is what they have to do  You're a doctor  You're not their doctor  You fucking asshole  He is doing that 
[03:23:00]  But that's where he's  That's where he's like  The celebrity thing  And I get that  And that's what he would do  To Hendrix  But Lindsay Lohan  Should be arrested  Because she's fucking  The thing is  I think the point  With Lindsay Lohan  Is she's fucking  Anybody else  Would get arrested  For doing that shit  She's fucking  Just ignoring  Court order after court order  And he's fucking  This pussy prosecution  He won't do anything about it  So she should be arrested  Because she's breaking the law  He was suggesting that  She be fucking  Set up  And put it  Yeah just go to  Rat her out  Basically  But did he say set up  Intervention  Did he say set up  Or did he say just
