<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of a plane crash where a toddler was the sole survivor, sparking speculation about the child's survival.  This segued into commentary on Bernie Madoff's 150-year sentence, with the hosts expressing their dissatisfaction with the perceived leniency towards white-collar criminals. A caller contributed a rumor that the toddler survived because he was in an older man's lap.  The conversation then dramatically shifted to Michael Jackson's death, focusing heavily on Joe Jackson's reaction and the conflicting reports surrounding the circumstances of Michael's death, including his will, funeral plans, and alleged fan suicides.  The hosts dissected Jackson's career, plastic surgery, and child molestation allegations, with listeners contributing anecdotes and observations (including a listener mentioning Wesley Snipes' appearance in "Bad").  Another caller suggested airline maintenance cuts as a potential factor in plane crashes, prompting a tangent on roller coaster simulator games before returning to the discussion of Joe Jackson's seemingly indifferent response to his son's death and his subsequent announcement of a new record label.  A reporter's anecdote about sharing a bathroom stall with Jackson during a trial was shared, followed by a clip of "Human Nature" and a discussion of Jackson's vocal style. Callers shared stories about Joe Jackson's alleged abuse of Michael and speculated on the reasons behind Michael's plastic surgeries.  The discussion briefly touched upon Lisa Marie Presley's attractiveness before circling back to Bernie Madoff and the SEC's failure, posing a hypothetical scenario involving a choice between 30 years of wealth and a 150-year prison sentence.  The segment concluded with discussions of the 911 calls related to Billy Mays' death and observations on the Gay Pride parade, including commentary on the attendees' attire and the potential impact on public perception of the LGBTQ+ community, along with a discussion on internet hoaxes regarding celebrity deaths.


The next segment launched into a tirade about the hosts' coworkers' excessive vacation time, using profanity to express their resentment.  This transitioned into a darkly humorous discussion of the recent deaths of Farrah Fawcett, Michael Jackson, and Billy Mays, including commentary on the 911 call following Mays' death and the dispatcher's perceived apathy. The conversation included discussions of infomercial products, gruesome details of various deaths (including suicides and accidents), and listener calls describing finding deceased relatives. One caller recounted performing the Heimlich maneuver on a woman who choked on a jawbreaker, which led to sexually suggestive banter. Another caller revealed their work hauling cadavers for the military for ballistic testing.  The segment concluded with a discussion of a listener's unexpected visit to Anthony's home.  Throughout, the hosts employed highly offensive language and made numerous crass jokes.


The third segment detailed Anthony Cumia's unsettling encounter with a listener who unexpectedly visited his home. The listener, whose identity was not revealed, demonstrated an unnerving level of knowledge about Cumia's personal life gleaned from the show. The visit, described as a "Rupert Pupkin" moment, involved increasingly odd behavior, including contacting Cumia's sister via Twitter.  The listener later called in to explain their actions as stemming from overzealous fandom and misinterpreting on-air comments. This led to a discussion about listener safety, the challenges of being a public figure, and appropriate fan behavior.  The conversation touched on Cumia's film role (with Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan), the hosts' bathroom habits, and an internal dispute between show interns. Callers offered perspectives and suggestions, including hiring Michael Jackson's former umbrella-carrying bodyguard.  Sam Roberts, a guest in the studio, shared his experience at the Gay Pride parade, describing the attendees' attire.


The subsequent segment focused heavily on Sam Roberts' Gay Pride parade experience, detailing the attire of attendees, including a lack of shirts, revealing underwear, and flamboyant costumes. A caller, Ben, a gay man, voiced concern that such displays might alienate potential LGBTQ+ supporters. The hosts and callers discussed the visual aspects of the parade, comparing it to a WWE event. The conversation frequently employed explicit language and focused on the sexualized aspects of the parade-goers' appearance.  A recurring comedic element involved a sexually suggestive song, the "Ass Man" song.  Sam Roberts' attractiveness was rated. The show included a phone interview with a man selling "Obama condoms" at the parade.  The hosts also interviewed several people at the parade, including Anthony, who shared his perspective on the event and stereotypes surrounding the gay community.  The interviews frequently included references to Billy Mays' death. A significant portion of the segment focused on the humorous anecdote about a staff member, Steve, unexpectedly taking a sick day and the resulting creation of a "yellow flag" paddle. The segment concluded with a phone call from Sean William Scott, promoting his movie "A Couple of Dicks," with discussions of the film and other related topics, including a fabricated story about Scott sleeping with Jessica Simpson.


The final segment featured Sean William Scott as a guest.  The conversation centered on his film experiences, particularly *Ice Age 3*, voice acting, and past relationships.  He shared anecdotes about cleaning his house after a breakup and a bizarre incident involving a false accusation of abuse.  The hosts and Scott discussed celebrity encounters and scandals, referencing their own infamous radio moments and interactions with various celebrities, including Robin Leach, Maureen McCormick, Ed Asner, Joe Rogan, Kristen Bell, and Amanda Peet, including a story about a crying naked midget during an interview with Colin Hanks and Jack Black.  The possibility of Scott visiting the set of a Kevin Smith film was also discussed.  The segment was filled with crude humor and sexually explicit language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Damn, that was a bit harsh.  What the hell is wrong with me?  How old are you?  I know!  What the hell is going on?  Hi!  Wow, the toddler survived that plane crash.  Dude, how sick of that.  Breaking news!  Yeah.  Jet with 150 on board plunges into the Indian Ocean, and the toddler survives.  Another one of these Airbus said it was in high wind. 
[00:00:30]  What the fuck is that?  A plane?  It's supposed to be windy up there.  These fucking Airbuses.  Does that sound weird to you that it sounded okay?  Yeah, I'm not hearing loud enough or something.  A little weird.  I don't know.  The fucking Airbus.  Yeah, wind should not be a problem when you're on an aircraft.  No, it's made to be in the wind.  How do the toddlers survive?  Toddlers need constant care.  The, uh, yeah, the sole survivor of this plane crash.  What was it just floating out there?  Saying that it happened like this. 
[00:01:00]  Doesn't that suck?  Fucking think he can't even talk.  Knows everything that happened.  And just wants a coochie-coo under the chin.  But how did it survive?  What was it in?  I don't know.  Did it swim?  That's because toddlers have no clue what's happening.  They don't brace.  They don't tense up.  They just sit there and get jostled around.  They could be dropped on their head.  It don't matter.  There's a case a few years ago, maybe 10 years ago, whatever it was.  It was a Chinese, 500 people on the plane. 
[00:01:30]  And it was what they call porpoising.  It was, uh, it was, uh, which was up and down, up and down.  And they lost control and they crashed into the side of a mountain.  And everybody on the plane was killed.  Except, I think, two babies survived.  Like, that's the only people that sometimes survive these things.  Amazing.  But we don't have any further details on...  I gotta know what...  Not yet, that kind of just happened.  I mean, because Tyler wasn't putting on its own little fucking life vest or anything.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  So how the fuck did it survive?  It was probably floating in a little seat. 
[00:02:00]  In its little baby seat.  Amazing.  Just thinking, like, that's how the trip goes.  Yeah.  They don't know any better.  Oh, is this it?  We crash into the ocean and then someone picks me up.  And, uh, the trip continues.  I guess we'll find out more.  The guys down the hall will get it.  Uh, well, the big news, Bernie Madoff is going away for the rest of his life.  150 years.  150 years.  Poor man.  I just want to take the opposite side and make a discussion.  You know, they're saying this is like the first case in history that no one is on his side. 
[00:02:30]  Like, nobody.  Not one person.  Like, usually when you're being sentenced, you get family members or close friends to come forward and go, you know.  He fucked everybody.  You know, he's really a good guy.  He was my father.  He was this.  No one.  Yeah.  Or at least to say, well, he's getting up there in age and he has a character witness.  You know, he was a very nice guy.  Yeah.  Nothing.  That's the headline in this whole thing.  Not one person came forward on his behalf yesterday when they were sentencing him for his crimes. 
[00:03:00]  Bomb Voyage.  As they say.  Well, like Jimmy said just before the show, hopefully it's hard time and not one of these soft prisons.  You know something?  With a sentence like that, I don't know.  They usually sentence these guys, the white collar criminals.  It's when they get like 19 months or something.  They give them that minimum security country club thing.  When you're in for 150 years, I think they're just putting this guy away somewhere and letting him rot. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  Let him rot.  He should be forced to mix with, the problem is they won't, because he's so famous, they won't let him.  Gen pop.  Exactly.  You want him to mix with, you know, Crips and Bloods and Latin Kings and all these young angry dudes.  Oh my God.  Like, that's what he should have to deal with is prison.  Mix him in with people that understand a scam, basically.  Oh, yeah.  Imagine that.  Huh?  Imagine that.  Him in the middle of that.  Nothing's going to happen to him.  Come on.  Struggling in the weight room with like five pounds. 
[00:04:00]  They got to bring back hard time.  Yeah.  Have him break rocks for the next 150 years.  Shackle to a...  Shackle to some other inmates.  Hardcore prisoners.  Just breaking rocks and then you speak up.  Why are we breaking rocks?  Just because we can make you do that.  Yeah, because that's what we do now.  Or maybe a chain gang.  Yeah.  Pick up some litter on the highway.  Because I think prison just becomes your life in the end.  Yeah, this guy's life was pretty fucking pretty sweet. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah, but after pretty sweet numbers.  A year or two, it becomes his life.  Yeah.  I'm telling you.  Yeah, he'll fit right in like Brooks or something.  He'll run the library.  Either that or he does have some financial knowledge.  He can maybe do the taxes for the guards and some of the other people.  Let me tell you.  He helps a few people invest right though.  A guy like that might not get the shipping out of him.  They might use him for how smart he is.  Do the books for the warden?  Wait a minute. 
[00:05:00]  Change his shoes out?  Yeah.  But they may go, hey, you got any tips?  And he starts throwing out tips.  Guys start looking out for him.  Guards look out for him.  If he helps you make some money on the outside, yeah.  I mean, I guarantee he would be able to at least guide you into a good investment.  Might work out for him.  Well, the good news, he's done.  Yeah.  Bye-bye.  He's done.  Hey, we know why the toddler survived.  Let's say hi to Garth in Indiana.  Garth.  Good morning, boys.  Hello, Garth.  What's up, Garth?  I heard the reason that kid survived the plane crash was because he was in the lap of an older gentleman. 
[00:05:30]  Oh.  Oh, I see.  Because then why?  Oh, I hope he didn't lose Uncle Paul on the flight.  Very good.  Mm-hmm.  Stop it.  What else is going on in the world?  Oh, my God.  Well, the Michael Jackson thing gets...  Debacle.  ...more and more interesting.  Why the fuck is Reverend Al hanging out with Joe Jackson?  He's by his side the entire time.  Because he's in the news.  Reverend Al...  That fucker can't keep his face out of the news. 
[00:06:00]  Reverend Al flew out to L.A.  He felt like his presence was needed to make sure Michael Jackson's taken care of in death?  What a fucking phony this guy is.  Is there any doubt that this guy is nothing but a publicity-seeking shithead?  Isn't there a bunch of other causes he could be involved with that are way more important than hanging out with Joe Jackson in L.A.?  Jesus.  Joe Jackson's doing some kind of, like, press conference, and there's Reverend Al with an arm on his shoulder, basically. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, of course.  I don't even know why you're comforting this guy.  He's consoling...  This guy doesn't give a shit.  Consoling him?  He's already saying, well, the legacy will continue.  Yeah, no shit.  Joe Jackson's gonna be pumping out all kinds of fucking tapes and everything else.  Well, he announced a new record label.  Oh, did he?  Joe Jackson's like, and the name of the new record label is, and it was some weird name I don't even remember anymore.  My son hated me, and I'm out of the will, and I need to make money records?  Right, probably.  That's a very long name for records.  It really is. 
[00:07:00]  It could probably not even fit on the record.  Probably beat them until they sing right productions.  Let me tell you something.  Scare the shit out of them through an open window.  Joe Jackson, say what you want, he beat those motherfuckers in a superstardom.  If you beat your kids and came up with the Partridge family, you shouldn't probably beat your kids.  But if you beat the Jackson 5 out of it, you've got fucking golden fists.  Motherfuckers can harmonize.  He'd punch him in the face a little harder.  Jesus, he sucked the kid around a little bit.  I was so scared.  You fucking put out Thriller.  His work ethic that he taught you did something. 
[00:07:30]  He beat the talent right into those boys.  He really did.  Well, here's your bullet points on the Michael Jackson thing.  We're way up to date on this.  Michael's mother filed for temporary custody of his three children yesterday.  Got the kids also.  They granted her temporary custody.  Just for now.  But yesterday's report that Debbie Rowe saying that those kids weren't Michael's, that was false.  A lot of false reports coming out these days.  Oh, yeah?  I mean, it still could be possible.  But it was announced that Debbie Rowe came out and said, no, those kids aren't his biologically anyway. 
[00:08:00]  But she didn't say that.  Joe Jackson says Michael's funeral will be large and open to the public.  Of course.  It's going to be one of these things.  Make it a spectacle.  Because that's what you did with your family from the second they popped out of the womb.  Jesus, this guy is despicable.  This whole family is so fucked up, and it doesn't end with him dropping dead. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, hell no.  Well, now it's good for business.  I think a dead Michael Jackson is worth way more than a live one.  Yeah, no one really was feeling it anymore.  Michael's final will was drafted in 2002 and does not include his father.  This is the biggie.  So the father, of course, is like, well, that had to be a forgery.  Fake.  Of course.  Really?  He loved me.  Really?  If all the reports are true, and it seems to be because they came from Michael Jackson, of course you're not in his will.  He hated you. 
[00:09:00]  Well, he'll make a hell of a lot of money anyway.  Anyway, president of Michael Jackson's online fan club says he thinks at least 12 fans have committed suicide since his death.  Then that heard.  Who the fuck is killing themselves because Michael Jackson died?  Then that heard.  Michael finished filming top secret Dome Project video.  What's that?  Is that the name of a song?  Dome Project?  That would be strange.  Just before he died, expected to be completed in July, so we'll see that. 
[00:09:30]  A picture surface of Michael Jackson rehearsing in L.A. just two days before he died.  Conflicting reports there.  Some saying he looked great.  Others said he looked really skinny, kind of out of it, and scared shitless about the upcoming tour.  Well, that's how he looked walking around.  Yeah.  You know what?  You hear so much bullshit.  There was reports initially.  Geraldo, I think, reported.  He just was what he heard.  He heard that he didn't hire. 
[00:10:00]  Maybe it wasn't Geraldo.  So he didn't hire background singers.  He didn't have dancers.  Of course he did.  So it's amazing the bullshit that comes out.  Oh, yeah, the bullshit.  It was all there.  Obviously, there are dancers there and everything.  Yeah, they were going to do these shows.  I don't know how good they were going to be, but they were on their way.  He goes with the wet jerry curl or went with the wet jerry curl kind of hair when he was live.  Is that it?  Because every other picture you see, he's got that Cornelius wig on. 
[00:10:30]  Well, there's rumors that he had no hair.  Yeah.  At the end of his life.  So who knows?  I mean, you know, we'll start getting the real facts soon.  This is a weird one.  Doctors waited 30 minutes after finding Jackson's body before calling 911.  The reason they couldn't find a phone that was working in the mansion.  And I'm like, come on.  Just stop.  No one has a cell phone?  That's ridiculous.  Just stop.  But that's being reported.  And then some people might get their money back for the London concerts. 
[00:11:00]  Why wouldn't they give them all their money back?  Some people.  How about everyone?  There's no rescheduling here.  They should really be an optimist.  I don't know how they would be able to pull that one off.  You buy a ticket for something that didn't happen, you don't get your money back.  That's pretty fucked up.  I wonder if there was some kind of weird little clause when you're buying the tickets.  Ah.  Huh?  Yeah.  Who knows?  You probably got to jump through hoops to get it also.  You know?  Yeah.  Send the ticket back on a 5x4 postcard. 
[00:11:30]  The way it's working with those tickets is you'll get the refund if you've purchased  your ticket from a reputable outlet.  Reputable.  Like if you just bought a ticket from some dude, you're not getting a refund for that.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, well, that's pretty obvious.  Are you trying to find some black gentleman outside the arena?  Yeah.  Excuse me.  I'd like a refund, sir.  Ow.  You're punching me in the face.  So, you know, just because you hold the ticket doesn't mean that you're entitled to  a refund.  Very good, Danny.  That makes sense.  And that's where we're at with Michael Jackson.  But, you know, I think sometime this week they're going to be parading his body around 
[00:12:00]  L.A.  Yeah, there's some kind of a horse-drawn carriage thing like Lady Di had with the, you know,  white carriage with the glass sides.  And they'll...  A little Cinderella action.  Yeah, yeah.  Of course.  For Michael Jackson who lived in Fantasyland anyway.  Yeah, yeah.  He had a replica of the entrance to Disneyland at his Neverland Ranch.  And they want...  I think they're going to bury him at Neverland, turn that into a Graceland because that would  be a big moneymaker. 
[00:12:30]  Is that rumor or...  Supposedly, they were like kind of checking out Neverland Ranch to see where there'd be  a good spot.  Where they could plant them?  Where they could plant them.  Yeah.  Jesus.  And I think Reverend Al was in L.A. because I think Reverend Al wants the body here in  New York.  Oh, is that it?  To go up there in Harlem.  It's just a weekend at Michael's.  Mm-hmm.  He's going to cart him around, take him to dinner uptown.  But that Reverend Al is a joke.  I don't know why people are still holding on to what he has to say. 
[00:13:00]  Anyone that takes this guy seriously should just be smacked in the head.  Why is it important that Reverend Al Jackson...  Uh, Reverend Al Jackson.  Might as well call him that.  Yeah, yeah.  Between Jesse Jackson and Joe Jackson.  Why is it important for him to be out there in L.A.?  I don't get it.  Yeah, to comfort the family.  I mean, because we only see Reverend Al when there's big media cases.  Uh-huh.  I'm sure he's working on shit all the time.  Whether it's...  Yeah.  Injustice.  Whether it's useful or not, that's not up to me, because I don't even know what he's 
[00:13:30]  working on when he's not, you know, whoring himself out to the media.  Mm-hmm.  You gotta think there's much more important stuff going on in his dumb little world.  But this is, uh, yeah, this has traction.  Mm-hmm.  This one's the...  It's news.  He's gonna be able to be in front of the cameras.  So why doesn't anyone call him out on this?  Because people are hypocrites and idiots.  Not us, because we have nothing to lose.  I'm talking about, like, CNN, MSNBC, Fox News Channel.  Something.  Another thing. 
[00:14:00]  I love the outpouring of love and adoration for this guy.  Musically influential?  Of course.  A huge talent?  Of course.  There's no denying that.  Uh, especially in the, um, mid-80s.  It was no one bigger.  He made it to the 90s.  Yeah, and then into the 90s.  But, I mean, you know, with Thriller and shit like that, that was just, that was his fucking  decade.  He owned it.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, no one's bringing up any of these sexual allegations that have pretty much been 
[00:14:30]  the only newsworthy thing in Michael Jackson's life, uh, the past 15 fucking years.  Mm-hmm.  Well, that's because most of us, uh, we're never touched by him.  So, you know, to us, it's like.  I guess that's it.  To us, it's like, eh.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, I kind of like that, uh, you know, walk with you song and don't stop until you  get enough, you know.  Yeah, you listen to him.  You go, I don't care.  You weren't diddled.  Who gives a shit?  Touched a few kids.  Why not?  In a way, that's how it should be.  I don't give a shit what these people are doing. 
[00:15:00]  Just entertain me.  There, there, there, there.  But they're talking about him like, uh, like, uh, a saint.  Well, he's.  Meanwhile, he, um.  But he's in that weird area.  He was never proven guilty.  You know what?  Even though, you know, public opinion is like, Jesus, something was going on with him.  Neither was OJ.  Him and those fucking kids.  Neither was OJ.  But he, he slept with kids in his bed.  Uh, there, there were allegations of just horrid things that this guy, uh, was doing. 
[00:15:30]  Kids, kids, kids had like, ID'd his schlong.  Jesus juice.  Remember the wine called Jesus juice?  He called it.  He's, he's.  I mean, just stop already.  He was delusional though, because I was watching a couple, uh, specials on Michael Jackson and  he went through that tough guy stage looking like, looking like, uh, like a fairy, like  a.  Trying to be bad.  He was trying to be badass.  Jump on.  And they got for the video some real gangster looking dudes.  And then Michael Jackson's in the leather, but he's, he's already looking girly. 
[00:16:00]  It's like, what are you trying to pull off there?  Because they're dance fighting.  Look, they're not fighting.  They're dance fighting.  If you get a dance fight, Michael's a guy you definitely want on your side.  Yeah.  Michael Jackson's the best dance fighter ever.  If fists are being thrown.  Fuck it.  Sit out, Mike.  Yeah.  Jaw.  Something tells me he's got a glass jaw.  Literally.  Why would you dance fight when you could just punch him right in the face and knock his nose  off his body? 
[00:16:30]  Why the fuck would you deal with that?  See, this was the earliest where you were, you were looking going, wow, he had some work  done, but at least he still looks kind of human.  And then he just went crazy and decided, you know, could you put a cleft in my chin?  With a hatchet?  And then I want my nose to be able to be removable.  How the fuck do you get a cleft in your chin?  Oh, it's...  What are they, stapling something right to your bone?  They probably put some implants in his chin.  It's ridiculous what this guy did.  He had to know how horrendous his plastic surgery looked. 
[00:17:00]  Well, that's why he kept doing it, probably hoping that eventually it would look good.  He's going to get better to fix it?  Yeah.  Like that during this video.  What's wrong?  Right, he's, he's kind of Hispanic looking.  He wanted to go for, you know, powder.  He wanted to look like powder.  Well, he went black to Hispanic to white.  Yeah.  He was representing all races with his plastic surgery.  Yeah.  This is not even a good song. 
[00:17:30]  Well, this was the end of his run.  Really, really bad.  What?  This song is bad.  It's bad.  Who's bad?  Huge hit, though.  Yay.  Yeah.  Huge hit.  But it's just like the whole gang thing where everybody's just tough and it's like, I hate  these fucking giant dance scenes.  Sarah.  And subways.  Yeah, but that was, that was the times.  Look, they're kicking ass on the other guys by dancing better.  Yeah.  They brung it.  And the other guys are like, oh, fuck, now what?  Now what?  Michael Jackson's here.  We're fucked.  We're fucked.  He's out dancing us. 
[00:18:00]  We have guns, but we're not allowed to use them because this is a dance fight.  Knives, chains, whatever.  They're running around doing pirouettes.  Right.  Yeah, they're all black belts and karate, but fuck, I can't use my skills.  And he pulls a grate off the wall and wind hits him.  All right, enough of bad.  Gives a shit.  Because he's bad.  That's a terrible video.  Who enjoyed it?  Someone's watching that and having fun with it, and I can't comprehend it.  It's horrible.  We didn't know any better.  When that video was out, that's all we had. 
[00:18:30]  That's the problem.  Well, the guy was also the pioneer of that long-form video.  Everyone before that was doing, you know, the quick, cheesy, regular video thing.  And then he brings in, you know, John Landis to direct.  It's on film.  It's fucking, you know, an epic.  He fucked up.  No one was doing that shit.  He fucked up Pat Benatar and the rest of them.  All of them just looked and went, well, there's the bar now.  Oh, great.  Thanks.  Thanks for setting the bar that fucking night.  Yeah, now we got to hang with Hollywood directors because he went, thanks.  We were good with a camera covered with tinfoil spinning around in the middle going, and 
[00:19:00]  I run.  Yeah.  And now I got to make an 18-minute feature film.  Yeah, they used to just find their nephew that was in film school in college.  Hey, could you film more video?  Got a camera?  Then stupid Michael Jackson gets John Landis.  John Landis.  Jesus Christ.  Fucking directing it.  And the video cost millions of dollars.  Oh, yeah.  The rest of them, you know, maybe 10 grand, 20 grand.  Yeah, we could get you on MTV, $10,000 to do this.  Well, a thriller's like an epic. 
[00:19:30]  That video stinks.  What, thriller?  But once again, for the time, it was pretty amazing.  You watched it when it was on, right?  Oh, yeah.  And by the way, that bad video was directed by Martin Scorsese.  Was it really?  That was Scorsese?  Yeah.  Yeah, well.  It didn't look like Scorsese's work.  How about fucking, maybe if De Niro and Pesci came in and punched Michael's nose off,  that would make me happy.  I couldn't reach.  He had Landis and Scorsese?  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  That is something, huh? 
[00:20:00]  Here's the story on the child.  So you got a plane that crashes in the Indian Ocean.  Everyone's dead except for a toddler.  Yemen Airlines Airbus A310 crashed in the Indian Ocean just north of the island of the Comoros.  According to the Associated Press, this aircraft, carrying more than 150 people, has landed in a wide-open area there.  But there have been rescue aircraft up, boats in the area.  And incredibly, a toddler has been pulled alive from the ocean. 
[00:20:30]  Yemeni's flight 626 was flying from Yemen's capital of Sana'a to the Comoros.  The president of the Comoros also says bodies and wreckage have been spotted in the water during a flyover.  It's the second crash of an Airbus jet this month.  On June the 1st, Air France flight 447 crashed off of Brazil, carrying 228 people.  All of those people presumed dead.  And, of course, we're going to keep you updated on this story throughout the morning.  We're going to bring up a pilot, by the way, who has flown Airbus planes ahead this hour to talk to us about what might have potentially happened to that aircraft. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, and there were some questions that we were looking into of whether or not those sensors that tell the plane how fast they're going  and how fast the airspeed needs to be when they're in the air, if those are malfunctioning in any way, shape, or form in some of these incidents.  It has been a repeated problem on some Airbus aircraft over the last few months, actually going all the way back to last year.  It's just amazing that a toddler pulled alive from that wreckage.  It's pretty incredible. It really is.  A repeated problem? I call it more than a repeated problem with these things going down. 
[00:21:30]  I'll take a Boeing 767, 777 any day.  Dude, how often do 747s go down? Almost never.  They're usually either terrorists have brought them down.  What was that? Canary Islands collision on the runway.  And then that fuel, obviously, fuel problem in the wing with the Flight 800.  But other than that, eh, these freaking Airbus, I don't know.  They're all so old.  I don't like those. 
[00:22:00]  Because they're all the plane crashes over there.  Because I think we sell a lot of our planes to other countries when we're done with them, right?  Here, Yemen, take this.  Airbus, those aren't all that old.  I mean, I just don't like that friggin' carbon fiber tail on those things.  They tell the guy you can't snap the rudder over too hard in the wind or that your tail comes off.  That's like a nice feature.  Yeah.  No, I don't think they're, I think the 747s and stuff are older than they are. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, yeah, they are, definitely.  I just, I don't fucking trust anything with an Airbus.  The name of it just annoys me.  I don't trust it.  Airbus.  Yeah, you don't want to go with something called the Airbus.  That's scary, because a bus should be on the ground, not in the air.  Hence, Airbus name stinks.  JetBlue uses only Airbus aircraft, which, you know, I like JetBlue and everything, but.  All right.  Enough with JetBlue.  I'm flying Friday on JetBlue.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah, thanks. 
[00:23:00]  Good luck, bro.  Fun fact, Michael used real crips and bloods for the background gang for bed, bringing two rival gangs together.  Thank you, Tony in Connecticut.  Making the peace.  Is that possible, you think?  No.  Or maybe it was old gang members that rehabilitated and said, all right, what the fuck, we'll do this and make a little stand for it, Michael.  Well, there was one guy.  One guy from each?  Yeah.  That happened to be brothers anyway.  And they kept him way in the back so they couldn't see each other.  And who was the lead member of the other gang that Michael Jackson was fighting? 
[00:23:30]  Samuel L. Jackson.  Oh, wow.  No.  Chad in Ohio.  Who cares?  I thought that's who the gang member was.  Chad in Ohio.  Hey, Chad.  Yeah, I watched that bad video for the first time the other day, and it was Wesley Snipes.  Wesley Snipes was in the rival gang?  I'm telling you, watch the video.  It's Wesley Snipes.  Wow.  Is it a young Wesley Snipes?  Yeah.  All right. 
[00:24:00]  We're going to have to go back to the bad video, I guess.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Punch it up.  All right.  Mike in Massachusetts.  Mike.  Mike.  Good morning, boys.  Hey, man.  Hey, Jimmy.  Hey, buddy.  Hey, this is what happens once the economy goes to shit.  The frigging bigwigs don't want to open their wallet up, so they fix their planes upright.  Instead, they lay off all their mechanics, and look at it.  Everything's going to shit.  Well, that is true.  The airlines, when they're taking a hit, the economy's bad, the price of fuel, things like that. 
[00:24:30]  You got to know they got a few less screw turners in the hangers.  Yeah.  Yeah, the system gets a little shoddier and shoddier day by day, you know?  But all right, boys.  Stop it out.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Like those little video games where you got to keep up maintenance on things, and then  sometimes when you realize you're going broke, you go, I got to cut back on things.  Yeah.  And you cut back on that, maintenance, and things.  Yeah.  And the panic sets in.  And then the roller coaster flies off the tracks because you didn't maintain it enough. 
[00:25:00]  Other people are grumbling because there's garbage on the sidewalk.  I love those games.  But they don't speak English, though.  There's that roller coaster sim.  All right.  I'll put a bathroom here.  Stop it.  There's people peeing their pants because you forgot to put bathrooms up.  I'm the worst at those games.  I just get all angry at the people that are angry and chase them out of the park.  That's the only way to play those games, though.  Roller coaster tycoon.  Oh, there's a roller coaster tycoon massacre. 
[00:25:30]  People do have fun with these.  They build roller coasters that have no way of surviving them.  Look at all the people walking up.  This guy did have made a very nice roller coaster, apparently.  It goes straight up.  Wow.  At a very high rate of speed.  Mm-hmm.  And then apparently...  Is there a top there?  Does it go down?  All right.  It goes over the top.  Oh, that's a nice...  Wow. 
[00:26:00]  Is that a high roller coaster?  Whoa.  Now it's going down.  Oh, I would hate that.  Loop.  All right.  Nice big bank turn.  Oh, no.  This ain't going to be good.  Oh, no.  Is it go...  Jesus.  And it comes off the track and kills all the people online.  And hits the line.  Oh, is that fantastic?  Oh, wow.  Fail.  And then explodes.  That's awesome. 
[00:26:30]  That's the guy who had it loop around right into the line of people waiting to get on the roller coaster.  That's the only way to play those games.  Why play it right?  There's so much stress with those games.  You're just trying to...  It's spinning plates.  That's what it is.  It's the spinning plates game.  Everything's breaking and you've got to fix them.  But, again, back to the whole aircraft thing.  It's the same thing.  You cut back on certain things and other things don't work out so well.  True.  Before we move on from the Michael Jackson thing, yeah, here's... 
[00:27:00]  I move on.  I move on.  I move on.  Here's Joe Jackson from yesterday talking about setting up the new record company.  Do you know anything, Mr. Jackson, about funeral arrangements?  Have you had time to work on that?  Yeah, we haven't gotten to that yet.  Yeah, but we're working on that.  This is my show.  He ain't working on shit, by the way.  But we're working on that.  He ain't working on shit, this guy.  He loves just being in the public eye as Michael Jackson's father.  And getting a boatload of cash.  I've never seen less grief in my life than...  I know, right?  ...and with this Joe Jackson guy. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  Janet Jackson sort of showed some grief on the BET Awards.  But it sounds like she hasn't had a relationship with Michael Jackson in so long.  That's why she said, you know, we all miss him.  Meaning, we haven't really hung out with him in years.  Yeah.  Was it kind of...  I didn't see the BET Awards.  Was it kind of like just like a...  You kind of have to say it didn't seem sincere?  No, she seemed pretty sincere.  But she also seemed like she really hasn't had any type of relationship with her own brother for a long time. 
[00:28:00]  And that's, I think, what she was referencing more than his death.  When she said, we miss him.  This is Marshall.  Thank you.  Thank you.  How is...  You said your wife is...  What about Janet and the rest of the family?  The daughters and everything?  They're all doing fine.  But I want to make this statement.  This is a real good statement, yeah.  Marshall and I have...  We own the record company called...  Tell them.  Morant Records.  Right.  Okay, it's driven by Blu-ray.  Right.  Technology.  Yeah.  And that's his next step.  And that's your next step. 
[00:28:30]  There had been...  Talk to us about...  This...  That's what they're talking about?  Yeah.  Fucking scumbag.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And this is who Reverend Allen needs to hang out with.  He just...  His kid isn't even fucking in the ground.  No.  They haven't even done the second autopsy on him.  No.  And he's promoting a new fucking record label.  And it...  It's obviously this guy could give a flying fuck about his kid.  Yep.  He just wants to make sure the money keeps rolling in.  I thought I plugged it in appropriate times. 
[00:29:00]  Wow.  Jesus Christ.  I don't have a kid being buried.  And yeah, he's promoting the new record company.  New record company.  Please.  That's way more important.  Let me keep making money off of this fucking kid's corpse.  Right.  Unbelievable.  What a scumbag.  And Reverend Allen, I'm going to say it all morning, is standing right there.  And the media continues to take this guy seriously.  Is anyone calling out anyone on this?  No.  What the fuck is the news doing? 
[00:29:30]  No.  Tributes all over the fucking place.  Oh, my God.  Show how fucked up this family was.  I feel...  I feel kind of sorry for Michael Jackson after hearing that.  No wonder the guy was so fucked up.  Yeah, no.  He was saying in some interview, somebody...  I didn't see the interview.  Somebody was relating what he said.  That he said he was so scared of his father, he would vomit on himself when his father...  Sometime when he would see his father, he would just throw up.  Apparently, he was terrified of his father. 
[00:30:00]  Wow.  Somebody was telling a story on CNN over the weekend, I think, and during his last child  molestation case, Michael Jackson had to go to the bathroom.  And they kind of stopped everyone from going to the bathroom, right?  And this one reporter happened to be in there already, so he's actually taking a leak side  by side with Michael and just kind of having a small chat.  No big deal, right?  Yeah.  They're both done with their business.  Michael leaves, and this guy leaves that retold the story. 
[00:30:30]  And the first person waiting on line to get into the bathroom was Michael Jackson's father.  Really?  They even told the father, no, fuck, Michael's in there.  You have to wait.  Wow.  You have to wait.  That's what kind of relationship they had.  No wonder he butchered himself.  He probably wanted to look nothing like his father.  Yeah.  God, look at that.  Oh, that's the most bizarre photo right there.  What's that?  It looks like he's in court there.  He's scratching his left eye.  And it fell off. 
[00:31:00]  But he looks like Japanimation almost with his eyes open really wide.  It's fucking creepy.  Yeah, they did something where they actually clipped his frigging eyelids, it looks like.  I don't know what they did.  They pinned him up.  Yeah, those eyes are...  Look at that nose, though.  There is so much...  Why couldn't they figure out the fucking nose for him?  You would think that would be easy.  I've been doing nose jobs forever.  Yeah, but...  But they shaved that bone down way too much.  They did too much on that one.  I'll bet you it was for sound, too, though.  I bet you he wanted his voice to see... 
[00:31:30]  He was afraid of his voice deepening.  Because, you know, his voice was still pretty high.  That he probably wanted to have that kind of nasal twang to it.  His...  There's a tribute channel on Sirius XM I've kind of had on in the background the last few days.  Michael Jackson had a creepy singing style.  What's that one song?  Human...  It was a big hit for him.  Human Nature?  Human Nature.  Can we hear a little of that?  He's so breathy and it's creepy to listen to.  Yeah.  And I remember that was like a huge freaking song for him. 
[00:32:00]  Listen just how breathy he gets.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey. 
[00:32:30]  Hey.  That is so creepy.  Your right.  I didn't realize how creepy it was but when you just listen to the vocal part.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Sing it better, motherfucker.  What are you doing, you son of a bitch? 
[00:33:00]  Not so breathy, motherfucker.  You think he had a good voice?  For real.  On certain songs.  Not this one.  Not this one, right?  But this was a big hit for him.  Yeah.  Was it?  Yeah.  This is a big hit?  Yeah.  I can honestly say I don't even think I'd remember this one. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  He had a good voice, but I think that he was overrated in a way because he was Michael.  Like, I never liked the Jackson 5 because I couldn't hear a little boy singing about adult relationships.  But his voice back then was Uncle Paul.  But, I mean, it was amazing.  His voice back then was amazing, though, how he could sing.  It was like, holy shit.  Amazing.  It just doesn't resonate with me.  It's coming from a deep place.  But then, I don't know.  No, it's also amazing that this is the same guy we're listening to right now.  Why? 
[00:34:00]  I guess he had a good voice.  Let's say hi to Chuck in Indiana.  Chuck.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, man.  What's up, little Jimmy?  Hey, buddy.  Hey, when Michael was like four years old, Joe Jackson used to hit him with a cattle prod.  And he just go, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Punch it out, guy.  Oh, that's the other thing I noticed listening to the Tribute Channel.  Oh, my.  I can't even count how many songs he did that.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. 
[00:34:30]  And many different versions of that.  Which was terrible, by the way.  That was like his catchphrase as he sang back then.  People loved hearing that.  Let's go to Woody in Kentucky.  Woody.  Hey.  Morning, guys.  Hi, Woody.  Hey, Woody.  Everybody talked about seeing the moonwalk for the first time,  but I haven't heard anybody talk about jacking off to that one with Lisa Marie.  That video he did with her was pretty good. 
[00:35:00]  For what song?  God, I can't remember the name of it.  They show it on, it was like early 90s kind of thing, and she's nude.  I kind of zoom in on her ass.  Oh, yeah.  I never thought she was fucking hot.  It's a pretty good jack, but you've got to be careful and time it out.  You'll fucking be blowing your load to him.  You didn't think Lisa Marie Presley was hot?  No.  She had really nice eyes.  She looked like Elvis.  Really nice eyes.  Her eyes looked like Elvis.  She looked like fucking Elvis.  All right, then I like Elvis's eyes then. 
[00:35:30]  What can I tell you?  Is that a cool ass?  No, I thought she had really nice eyes.  Her daughter is smoking.  You see pictures of Lisa Marie Presley's daughter yet?  No.  I think she's a model.  How old is she?  How old is she?  She's right around that model age.  She's like 10?  12.  No, no, no.  She's anywhere from 15 to 21, somewhere in there.  I know that's a big gap.  I don't know for sure how old.  She's got a big gap?  Yeah, a big gap. 
[00:36:00]  What?  We got the news story on Madoff, too, which is the big news.  I don't know what we're supposed to do with the Madoff fucking thing.  Justice is being served, obviously.  Let's see if there's anything else in this.  For Bernie Madoff, it was payback time.  150 years for billions robbed and lives ruined.  Madoff made my life a hell.  And I hope his life and his families are now a hell.  In federal court, victims spewed at the Ponzi schemer as Madoff stared straight. 
[00:36:30]  Let me ask you something.  That's a very interesting statement.  How long did he get away with this?  And would you take that contract?  Because he's what, 60?  He's 71.  71, okay.  Probably 30 years, 35 years.  Yeah.  So would you, I would take that contract.  30 years of amazing wealth.  30 years.  It's like making a deal with the devil.  Say 30 years from right now.  It is.  It's like making a deal with the devil.  And then you're in your 70s and they finally catch you. 
[00:37:00]  Would you take that deal?  But you have amazing wealth for the next 30 years.  Could go wherever the fuck you want.  Buy whatever the fuck you want.  Fuck whatever you want.  That's pretty good.  I would so take that deal.  That's a pretty good deal.  But then you got to be in prison when you're done.  71.  What else is there to do?  You know what it is?  He's just short of like starting to get old.  You know what I mean?  In five years it won't make any.  You'd be 70 though at some point just going, oh man.  Well.  This sucks.  Like they said he's like going for massages and stuff like that. 
[00:37:30]  Like he would walk.  His secretary said he would leave the office and go out for his daily.  Like he enjoyed living the life.  He had everything.  Yeah.  Would you take that contract?  I think I would take that contract.  That's why when that victim said, I hope he suffers like we did.  I'm like, I think it's too late.  Really?  Yeah.  He already.  I mean, he's got the big fall, but I mean, it's not like he's still a younger guy.  He's up there.  But the thing is golf game is probably suffering.  His hard ons aren't as hard anymore.  You know what I mean?  So I was like, ah, it's got them droopy ones. 
[00:38:00]  Right.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Because, you know, you're at that point.  He's not going to suffer.  And you got to be in prison.  You know, another year from now.  Whatever.  And he knows what it's like to live large.  He'll look back and go, God damn, I had a fucking fun 30 some odd years.  But he knows what that's like.  Fucking over everybody.  Yeah.  To live well.  I don't think you really suffer that much in prison in the end. 
[00:38:30]  I don't know.  You remember the worst part?  I really don't.  The worst part about being off the air?  It wasn't.  It wasn't.  It was.  It was it being gone.  Remember, it was like you had the money.  It wasn't like the money.  It was just that fucking thing that was lacking because you knew what it was like to have it.  You know what?  It's probably a relief for him, too, because throughout that whole 30 plus years, he's like, when the fuck am I going to get caught?  And why haven't I been caught yet?  They got to catch on soon.  And that's got to like play heavy on your heart.  The first inkling that they were catching on, he must have been, oh, here it comes.  Here it comes. 
[00:39:00]  I would have just like taken a jet and just.  Yeah.  Just go somewhere.  Yeah.  Somewhere.  A little island somewhere with all your money.  And just hope for the best.  Spewed at the Ponzi schemer as Madoff stared straight ahead.  They called him a psychopath, a beast, and an evil lowlife.  When Madoff got up to speak, one left the courtroom.  Madoff partially turned to his victims and said, I'm sorry.  I know that doesn't help you.  Then it was Judge Denny Chin's turn.  He called Madoff extraordinarily evil and gave him the max 150 years. 
[00:39:30]  Madoff didn't even flinch.  Well, no.  He knew it was coming for a really long time.  Flinch.  Ow!  Right.  You go like, yeah!  100,000!  You should get the death penalty.  Then he would suffer.  He should make you suffer.  How did, let me ask you a question.  How is the SEC not responsible for paying some of these people back?  They were warned 10 years ago that it was a Ponzi scheme.  And I think they were afraid of him because he used to be the head of the NASDAQ. 
[00:40:00]  People were scared of this guy.  How is the government on some level, when they were, their job is to protect you.  This is what we fucking pay them for.  Yeah.  And they were warned and they wouldn't investigate him.  Or they, or they didn't, uh, people who looked at him saw what he was doing.  No, he was the face of it.  He was the guy.  So they were able to just say, yeah, this is the guy to blame, not us.  This is, uh, I agree though.  You know, the SEC is, especially if they were warned about this guy, should have saved people billions. 
[00:40:30]  Well, you know, you know how they're, they're, they're making you return any profits.  You have to give back profits because he's doing a legal policy scheme.  Yeah, yeah.  So I want to know, is the IRS going to give back the money that people paid them?  Yeah.  Like if I profited illegally, not even knowing it, I might have to turn my profits over to the government.  So the IRS must have to give back my profits too, right?  To me?  Probably not.  No?  Yeah.  Oh, how's that work?  Isn't that amazing?  Yeah.  Amazing.  Danny, what's up?  Nice one-sided.  Boys, don't forget, he's going to federal prison.  That place is a country club.  My old man was there.  He said, it's a joke. 
[00:41:00]  Why was your old man in federal prison?  Oh, man, he was, he was a bad man.  He wasn't a bad man.  He was just running a bunch of drugs down in Manhattan.  Danny was a bad man.  Right.  All right, but what did your dad say about federal prison?  Oh, man, they'd have a buffet.  They would have, they'd ride bikes around the compound.  It was just, he had a TV in his room, had his own room.  I spent a little time in Florida, and it was a state jail. 
[00:41:30]  And over there, you have to share a room with somebody else.  You don't have a TV.  It's horrible.  In federal prison, you have, it's like a hotel living.  Now, I wonder, Bernie Madoff, I wonder if he made some kind of,  some kind of a deal knowing what he knows.  You know what I mean?  Like, they sat him down and go, look, you're fucked.  You're fucked.  And I know you know.  What a horrible deal did he get for 150 years.  Federal prison instead of hard times.  Something like that is what I'm thinking.  Because why isn't he talking out? 
[00:42:00]  It seems like he knows other people.  It seems like it's, you know what I mean?  It's a club down there, what he was involved with.  He actually said he was the only one involved in this.  That's what makes me very suspicious.  You know, statement that.  And I'm just wondering if they go, look, no matter what, you're fucked.  There's nothing we can do for you.  But if you keep your fucking mouth shut, we'll at least get you in federal prison  where it's a little easier than going to Rikers or whatnot.  Something doesn't, you know, sound right.  How can he be the only guy? 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, that's a pretty big operation.  How can he be the only one?  He's not hanging out with guys on golf courses and stuff and going on vacations.  And you know what I mean?  It's like a little club.  He's got this great money-making thing.  You want in?  They said, look, you're taking the hit for all of us.  But we'll make sure, you know, your time is the best we can make it.  His wife's getting to keep $2.5 million, too.  Which she should probably be allowed to keep fucking 50 grand and then go.  She should be able to keep none of that shit.  Maybe that was part of the deal.  Why are they saying she gets $2.5 million?  I don't know. 
[00:43:00]  I don't know how they're working that out.  I don't know if she knew what he was doing or not.  And who the fuck knows if the wife knows what the husband's business is.  She may just know he's a business.  What did she do that she deserves $2.5 million?  Nothing.  Hit the streets.  Hit the bricks, honey.  That's right.  Yeah, she should be able to keep none of it.  All right.  Billy Mays.  We're going to talk about him next.  Billy Mays.  We got the 911 call.  Nice.  Really?  Yes, we do.  And another 911 call, which is just terrific.  Uh-oh. 
[00:43:30]  So two 911 calls on the way.  And Sam went down to the Gay Pride Day yesterday?  Gay Pride Parade?  It was on Sunday.  It was Pride Weekend, actually.  But the parade here in the city was on Sunday.  Not for work, right?  Just to hang out down there.  What parade was he at then, yesterday?  None.  So this is from Sunday?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  It was Gay Pride.  Sam talked to the geese, and he did a little what's the haps.  What's the haps?  So we'll do that after the break as well. 
[00:44:00]  A lot of flamboyant gay people down there at that parade.  We're going to find out.  Down there.  I was in the city on Sunday up here.  It's everywhere.  And they were all over the place.  Unbelievable.  Just like walking down 57th Street.  Just very flamboyant, sparkly shorts.  Ooh.  And just extreme.  A lot of people holding hands and just being very, very flamboyantly gay.  Being very gay in public.  Now, have we talked to, like, the gay community in general?  Like, that's like, I can't imagine they want that type of gay representing everybody in their community, right? 
[00:44:30]  It's the one that makes the news.  Yeah, but what is the gay community?  Aren't they trying to tell these people, well, you calm the fuck down?  We're trying to get some shit done.  You can't walk the streets and, you know, this shit and fucking do what you're doing.  That is the ammunition for the conservatives when they just go, all right, look at this video.  And there's some fucking guy dressed like Cher sucking some other guy's dick on a float.  Instead of two, you know, normal guys in business suits.  Yeah.  Trying to. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah, we're just trying to get married.  Right.  Get married.  I love Pete.  Raise their.  Right.  Try to raise their gay family.  Instead, it's the flamboyant shit that makes the news.  You would think that they would sit down as a community and go, look, enough.  With the flamboyant shit, you're killing us.  Exactly.  Can you imagine if, like, Jewish people had, like, a Jewish day parade?  It was all just Hasidic Jews.  Yeah, Hasidic Jews, like, chasing money through the streets.  Every stereotype.  Yeah, like Borat.  Right, exactly.  The running of the Jews. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, it's just every bad stereotype.  Look, Fred, could you leave your peacock, you know, uniform or costume at home, please?  We're trying to get some things done.  We're trying to legalize marriage in all 50 states.  Trying for equality and acceptance.  You and your peacock ass-showing fucking costume isn't helping the cause.  Expressing yourself doesn't mean showing your genitals on Fifth Avenue.  Right.  Can you please not show your genitals on Fifth Avenue?  I mean, look at this guy.  That's all we ask.  Looking at a guy on some rollerblades. 
[00:46:00]  What does the gay community do about this?  Pretty much nude.  Like, this isn't a—I can't—I can't imagine that they're looking at this as like, yeah, this is our—this is a celebration for us.  But it's a complete celebration of nothing but sexuality.  Right.  And, you know, if you did a straight parade like this, it would be hysterical.  Just guys going around fucking women.  Dicks hanging out.  Right.  Here's where I—I love putting this in a vagina.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:46:30]  And I'm going to show you here on this float.  But don't take your—like, don't have a parade where you showcase every sexual aspect and then wonder why people are nervous about having you.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Teach.  And, yeah.  I mean, look at these guys.  I mean, come on.  There are a bunch of muscle men walking around in jockey shorts.  Is this from this weekend?  I don't know.  I'm not sure about that.  But it's like, why do you have to wear jockey shorts?  All right, you're all well-built guys.  Why can't you just wear fucking jeans or regular jean shorts? 
[00:47:00]  Because the cock is so much easier to get out in jockeys.  But why do you need to highlight the cock?  Like, straight guys, we like our cocks, too.  It's like, everyone likes their own cocks.  Why do you have to—  How about we have a straight parade where women's cutlips are highlighted?  Look at that.  Isn't that lovely?  A giant cake.  Gary, can you leave your banana hammock home?  We're trying to get marriage legalized in Indiana.  We're really trying to let people look at us in a different way.  I can't imagine these pictures that Danny is finding is going to help the cause. 
[00:47:30]  They're dressed in sailor hats with the blue, like what the sailors wear around their neck.  But no shirt or pants.  No.  And what they are wearing is jock straps.  Calvin Klein, the tiny Calvin Klein, you know, underpants.  Those are jocks.  And then boots.  I'm not putting anything crazy into the search field either.  It's just gay parade, and you'll find all these pictures.  That's all it takes.  Unbelievable.  You'd think somebody would sit them down and go, look, could you and Phil— 
[00:48:00]  Like, we're trying to get something done here.  Could you not hump each other on the float?  Right.  They don't do that at the Columbus Day Parade.  They don't do that at the Puerto Rican—  All right, they don't do that at the Columbus Parade.  Look at the young Rich Voss having a good time.  Oh, God damn.  There's a guy with Voss hair.  From making out with some guys.  His long, curly hair that we've seen on Voss.  Jesus.  Yeah, I don't—we'll have to ask Sam if maybe they toned it down because—  They bring the squeegee team in after.  Jeez. 
[00:48:30]  Hoses.  Just squeegee things.  Squeegeeing stuff into the sewers.  Oh, yeah, there you go.  That's what you need.  A big black guy in a loincloth with bones around his neck.  That's wonderful.  All right, we'll take a break.  We'll do What's the Haps at the Gay Pride Parade.  Sam did that for us.  Ooh.  And we'll talk about Billy Mays.  Yes.  I guess we know how he died now.  Wow.  Yes, the autopsy is through.  Already? 
[00:49:00]  Yeah, yeah.  All right, we'll tell you next.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  There's a great craze going on on the internet the last few days.  George Clooney is the latest victim.  The fake celebrity death craze.  Yeah.  It fucking rules.  There was a Britney Spears one yesterday.  There's a George Clooney one today.  Jeff Goldblum.  Jeff Goldblum was like the first fake one.  And because so many celebrities have been dying, no one really believed Billy Mays was dead 
[00:49:30]  because everyone thought it was a goof.  And Rick Astley, right?  Rick Astley is...  Astley, Astley.  He's the number one Google trend, Rick Astley dead.  Come on.  I love it.  He's not dead.  We should start one on our show.  Yeah.  Maybe a mayor or something.  Nah, maybe we're going to leave that one on.  That's crazy. 
[00:50:00]  See, we started the whole thing years ago.  Oh, yeah.  Hoo-hoo.  Hoo-hoo to us.  Yes.  Is Hoo-hoo working this week?  Does anyone know?  Vacation.  Huh?  He's on vacation.  God damn, that's got to be something.  Are you kidding me?  That has to be something.  So how long is he on vacation for?  Is he on vacation?  Yeah, all week.  All week?  Definitely.  He'll be back next week?  Shit.  I don't know.  It's just astounding.  I, you know, I'm not even going to, I'm not even going to fucking criticize him.  I'm not even going to go. 
[00:50:30]  Because if you could get away with that, that fucking deal, God bless you.  But who the fuck?  Yeah, when it's our turn for that deal, they're like, ah, see, it didn't work the first time  we did it.  So we can't ever do that again.  I had phone calls yesterday, all kinds of shit, all kinds of stuff.  And it's just weeks, weeks of being off.  We've been in this building since early April.  So almost three months, I guess, May, June, let's call it almost three months. 
[00:51:00]  I think we, we haven't even taken a week off yet.  No, no.  Because we, we took a week off before we moved over here.  Yeah.  So officially we haven't taken a week since we started here three months ago.  So, and it's safe to say, probably, it's safe to say counting this week.  Wow.  Counting all the Fridays.  Well, it's, it's, it's mind boggling how many days he's had off since we moved into this  building.  Are we jealous?  Abso-fucking-lutely. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, yes.  I'm not even going to front.  Abso-fucking-lutely.  But I don't know how that could possibly be good for a company, but who am I to say?  Wow.  Oh, he's on vacation until July 12th.  The 12th?  Get the fuck out of here.  And we're taking Friday off so we could, so we could have a long weekend and, and the  guilt these fuckers down the hall give us over that one.  Oh my God.  Forget about it.  I'm scared because I actually, you have to leave maybe an hour early on Thursday to catch 
[00:52:00]  a flight.  I don't even know how I, I, I present that to the bosses.  I don't even know how I get that done.  You know what you do?  We start a small fire and then we all just run out for the drill and don't come back.  Right.  Yeah.  That could work.  We are, we are three Michael Jacksons and there's a bunch of Joe Jacksons down the hall  scaring the fucking shit out of us.  Scaring us.  Just imagine that.  It's July 4th weekend.  We have Friday off.  We were able to pull that off.  I, I need to get out of here a little early Thursday and I'm too scared to tell him that. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  And this guy is off till July 12th.  Wow.  Is that unbelievable?  And he gets the whole month of August off.  So he's coming back for two weeks to go away for another month.  And no Fridays.  And no Fridays on top of that.  I, I, I don't know what to say anymore.  I don't even know what to say anymore.  And there's no one here, by the way, we're the only people that show up every day.  Look down the hall. 
[00:53:00]  No one's even here yet.  No, I know.  There's nothing.  The place is deserted.  Well, you're, he comes back July 12th.  God, that's something.  What a deal.  What a deal.  And the, the shit they're pulling with us.  It's, it's just amazing.  Oh my God.  Amazing is a very nice way to put it.  It's amazing.  You're being very diplomatic.  It's amazing.  The stuff we can't even talk about.  I was just dammering on the phone yesterday during, you know, my explanation of my personal day that I took with Steve Blatter. 
[00:53:30]  I had to like, I was on the phone, like, like going, this is why, why, I, like I had to explain my, July 12th.  Well, the good news, this is Nick in New Mexico.  And this is why it doesn't work, by the way.  I'm sorry, but someone has to say it.  It doesn't work when you're, when you're quote main guy takes that much time off.  I don't know how that works for a company. 
[00:54:00]  Uh, go ahead, Nick.  Yeah.  How you doing guys?  Hey, it doesn't, it doesn't work at all because he's so irrelevant that when his well-informed listeners finally hear about Farrell Fawcett and Michael Jackson, it'll be July 13th.  Yeah, great timing on his part.  The pop culture world is in a tizzy right now.  Yeah.  And I, I know the break cause he's done it a million times.  Well, everybody wants me to comment on Michael Jackson's death. 
[00:54:30]  Everybody's been talking to me and they, they want me to comment on Michael Jackson's death.  Well, here it goes.  You know, back in, uh, the early nineties, Michael Jackson wanted to sit down with me to reinvent his career.  Oh, right.  Really?  Do you have a picture of that meeting?  Cause I don't believe it.  And he came in and his nose fell off.  Right.  And I, uh, I decided that that would not be good for me.  So I passed on that.  But everyone, everyone wants me to comment on the Michael Jackson thing. 
[00:55:00]  He's done that break a million fucking times.  Like, yeah, the whole world doesn't know what to do with themselves until Howard comments on the Michael Jackson situation.  You know, I was out there in the Hamptons and everybody said, man, what are you thinking about the Michael Jackson thing?  I said, shut up.  I got to watch the polo game.  Everybody.  It's always everybody.  Yeah.  Okay.  Everybody was getting ahold of me.  They wanted to know about Farrah Fawcett. 
[00:55:30]  Everybody.  Everybody.  Everybody.  Everybody.  I guess I, or you can seen.  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  I guess I got a comment.  I guess I got a comment on the Michael Jackson situation.  Do you really?  Yeah.  How about you just talk about it like a human being?  Jesus.  July 12th.  That just stopped the radio show.  I know. 
[00:56:00]  And I'm really,  And we're taking a lousy day off for the 4th of July weekend.  And there's grumblings.  The fucking workhorses.  And there's grumblings.  Right.  Yeah.  I think I'm going to be injected with my, my, my hormones down the hall.  So my voice doesn't change.  Thank you.  Thank you, Joe Jackson for the opportunity.  Thank you.  Unbelievable.  Oh God.  Get out of here.  What?  What?  Eric.  Does he really think that?  Yeah.  That is the dumbest thing we could do. 
[00:56:30]  Look, that entered my brain.  And then I said, look, I'm not even going to vocalize that.  E-Rock's a nice, E-Rock's a nice fat kid with no instincts.  Not, except to eat.  It's instinctual.  People are yelling red flag.  Sorry, Eric.  People are yelling, people are yelling red flag.  It's like, no, this is, this is what's going on.  That's crazy.  No, that was a red flag.  Oh yeah.  And we red flagged ourselves.  But this is funny.  So wait, he comes back July 12th and then goes back.  I think his deal is he gets every August off now. 
[00:57:00]  So what, he comes back for, oh, he gives us two weeks.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Everybody.  I couldn't even walk around with someone going, Howard, what do you think of the Michael Jackson thing?  I mean, I met the guy.  And then Farrah Fawcett, I don't know.  I don't know.  Yeah.  But the workhorses are here once again today.  Jesus. 
[00:57:30]  And then they give us crap about stuff we can't even mention on the air.  And when we, when we finally tell you what, what, what is going on, you guys are going  to be stupefied.  Holy shit.  Yellow flag.  I know.  We need a yellow.  We need a triple thing.  But they can't.  Like a triangle.  Yeah.  Red, green, but then a yellow.  Yellow flag is the corner.  Everybody.  Because I'm the greatest thing ever. 
[00:58:00]  Billy Mays is dead.  Everyone was thinking that.  You're kidding.  Everyone was thinking that it was a little bump on the head because of a little fucking  turbulence, right?  How did your shill die?  That's terrible.  I smell clean.  Ah, that poor guy.  Look at him.  Thumbs up.  Happy as a pig and shit.  Yeah.  And, uh.  He should put one of those thumbs in the hole in his heart. 
[00:58:30]  Oh.  Jesus.  Oh, some of the blockage.  Clear some of the blockage out with the thumb.  Or maybe he had too much of that putty in his fucking veins there, Danny.  The one you liked.  Mighty putty?  Mighty putty.  That's what it was.  He was eating mighty putty.  Maybe too much mighty putty in his system.  He had to clear out his aorta with an awesome auger.  Oh, shit.  I guess we gave it away, but it turns out the fucking guy had heart disease and that  bump on the head was just a major coincidence.  Yeah.  That was nothing.  A little turbulence.  He gets hit on the head because some luggage fell or something fell from above. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, and then he dies.  And then he twitters that he got a little bump on his head.  He goes to bed and never wakes up.  What about the ShamWow guy?  Did he die, too, or no?  No, he just fucked a hooker and beat her up.  He got the shit beat out of him.  Oh, by a hooker.  Anthony, by the way, someone has a calendar.  They said, no, we were wrong.  He actually comes back on the 13th because the 12th is a Sunday.  Oh, okay.  So add another day to that.  Add an extra day.  That's fine.  By the time he comes back, we will do another 10 to 11 original shows for everybody. 
[00:59:30]  God damn.  Oh, my God.  Is that the ShamWow hooker?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  They're both just...  That must have been a hell of a session.  Oh, yeah.  I'm looking at hospital pictures.  They both have the shit beat out of them.  Would you take that deal?  What?  Well, I mean, you're going to end up like that, but like you said, it must have been a  hell of a deal.  Must have been fucked up.  That must have been a hell of a fucking session, is like you're saying.  Is that her down at the bottom? 
[01:00:00]  Let me see her there.  What the fuck happened there?  That's bizarre.  Wow.  She looked...  Without those giant black eyes and red fucking...  Red eyes, she probably wasn't that bad looking.  Maybe I could find it again.  I saw yesterday.  I pulled up her mugshot from like 2004.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, she wasn't...  She's not that bad.  Not that bad?  Nah.  What's he saying happened?  Did he say, did she want more money?  Did she not want to...  A lot of these girls don't want to fuck.  They want to show up.  You're paying for my time.  And then they want to charge you more when they get there.  I think, from what I remember, I might have it wrong, but I think he wanted to kiss her 
[01:00:30]  and she didn't want to kiss.  Oh.  And he kept like trying to stick his tongue in her mouth or something.  And I think she actually like bit it.  And that's why...  She tried to bite her right off.  That's why there's blood all over his cheeks and stuff.  His chin because it was like blood in the mouth.  Yeah, his tongue's fucked up.  So we got to Billy Mays 911 call, but it turns out he died of heart disease.  Did he have a heart attack?  He must have had a heart attack, right?  That's the same while he was sleeping.  He went to bed.  He wasn't feeling good.  And that's it. 
[01:01:00]  What a great way to go out.  Billy Mays doesn't wake up.  Hypertensive heart disease?  What is hypertensive heart disease?  High blood pressure and then...  High blood pressure and a little blockage maybe?  A little combo?  A little combo platter with the heart?  Yeah, she's not that bad.  The ShamWow hooker girl.  When she's cleaned up, she looks pretty good.  She cleans up nice when she doesn't have black eyes.  Who the fuck does she look like?  The hooker that the ShamWow guy picked.  Ah, there's a little...  Something in there. 
[01:01:30]  I know.  The picture on the right, you're thinking, right?  A little Kate Hudson on the right, slightly.  And a little...  Oh, what's her name?  Scarlett Johansson on the left.  A little Mackenzie Phillips, circa 1981.  She looks like somebody.  It's just...  Ah, whatever.  Like one of the Tilly sisters as a younger.  On the left.  A little bit.  Rebecca DeMoray?  DeMoray.  There you go.  That's exactly who it is.  Maybe.  Rebecca DeMoray.  Here's the Billy Mays 911 call. 
[01:02:00]  Could you send an ambulance?  Billy Mays here, needs some emergency services.  I'm going to go for a rescue.  What is the address of the emergency?  Okay, tell me exactly what happened.  I don't know.  I just woke up right now, and I went and looked at him.  He's rolling over, and his lips are all purple.  Are you with him now?  Yes.  How old is he?  50.  Is he awake?  No.  Is he breathing?  No, and he's cold. 
[01:02:30]  Okay, we...  Oh, God.  I got the fucking chills.  That's pretty much like, well, guys, don't rush.  Don't have to rush over there.  Why are these made public?  These are, like, weirdly private moments, aren't they?  Why does your body go cold when it's still kind of warm in the area?  For real.  I'm not even joking.  For real.  Like, room temperature isn't 98.6, or, you know, whatever your skin temperature is.  So, once that core temp drops... 
[01:03:00]  So, like, 70 actually feels cold?  You know what I'm trying to say?  I feel like, yeah.  When you touch...  Maybe because you're used to...  When you're used to, you know...  Touching someone's body, and it feels warm, 70 must feel really cold.  Yeah.  Oh, and he's cold.  Hmm.  Well, he doesn't have a product to solve that one.  No.  No.  That's a bad one.  Wow.  That's okay.  We can still help him, okay?  Did you see what happened?  No.  No.  Listen, ma'am.  Ma'am. 
[01:03:30]  Ma'am.  Listen.  We're going to help him until they get there.  You hear me?  Yes.  All right.  I want you to get him on the floor.  Frank, I need to get him on the floor.  Okay.  Let's do it very quickly.  I want you to lay him flat on his back on the floor.  Do not put any pillows behind his head.  Don't put any pillows behind his head.  Let me know when this is done.  We can't get him up, ma'am.  He's gone. 
[01:04:00]  Okay.  Well, ma'am, we can still help him, okay?  How come you can't get him on the floor?  Uh-uh.  Tell him.  Okay.  Hello.  Sir?  How great would this be if it ended with, like, some horrific product that he was pitching  and the operator tells her to pick up the product and slam it on his head because she's a disruptile  customer?  Oh, God.  That's terrible.  I can't think of one of the things he used to pitch, though.  Mighty Putty.  Not the Mighty Putty.  Like, one of those fucking...  One of those forearm lifters. 
[01:04:30]  Like, wait.  It's just like a...  You just use leverage from your forearms to lift stuff.  Like refrigerators.  Oxy.  All right.  Now take the Hercules hook.  Hello.  Sir?  Yes.  Okay, we can start CPR by getting him on the floor.  It's too late.  How come?  He's gone.  Sir, we can still try and do CPR.  Cold.  Sir, that doesn't matter.  Okay, is he stiff or you can't move him?  I cannot move him. 
[01:05:00]  He's rigid.  Rigid?  Yes.  All right.  Well, they're on the way.  Okay.  All right, sir.  Just put away any family pets, okay?  Thank you.  Oh, yeah.  You're worried about a fucking nip-nip dog.  Well, you know what's weird, though?  It's like, no, we're not even going to try.  Yeah.  It's like, he's dead.  That was kind of like...  Well, they're going like, look, you know, what are you, a fucking doctor or something  like that?  Put him on the floor and start pumping.  But I think you know dead when you see it.  Yeah, you probably do.  But you know...  The person's like, no.  Even at that point, though, you know, give it the old college try. 
[01:05:30]  If his color's way different and he's cold and he might be a bit on the stiff side, you  know, come on.  De Niro got a more comforting call in fucking Goodfellas about Pesci.  Billy Mays is gone.  Couldn't be helped.  Couldn't be helped.  He's gone and that's dead.  And there was nothing we could do about it.  Nothing could do.  Damn, his...  Billy Mays had to answer for all those shitty products.  Damn, man.  He just had a...  His fucking...  His fucking... 
[01:06:00]  The air conditioning up or...  His fucking...  Eating a Jolly Rancher.  Who's that guy already on the scene?  If they're just waking up out of bed, who's that man?  Maybe a neighbor or something.  Well, I mean, he had a lot of money.  So it wouldn't surprise me if they had, like, some kind of assistant that was there anyway.  Assistant that didn't fucking want to, you know, take the effort to put him on the floor.  He had a huge house.  He drove a Bentley.  I mean, I'm sure the guy had...  Yeah.  I'm sure he had some assistants in the house.  Okay.  That's terrible.  His fucking baseball card's gonna be worth a lot of money now, man.  Jesus.  No, you keep...  It's Billy Mays. 
[01:06:30]  Oh.  Yeah.  You know what, though?  Billy.  I bet you the baseball card went up a little bit because there are enough people out there  that would probably go, oh, fuck.  You hear about Willie Mays?  No.  I gotta go buy one of his baseball cards now.  Billy.  Let's say hi to Matt in Philly.  Matt.  Yeah.  Hey.  The way that 911 was talking, it sounded, like, so douchey.  Like, she really didn't give a fuck that Billy Mays died.  Well...  You mean the one who called or the lady who was trying to help? 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  Well, the lady on the phone, she doesn't give a shit because she doesn't know the guy.  But she seemed like she was just...  She's just doing her dumb job.  Doing her job.  Yeah.  She don't care.  Pretty properly.  She was trying to give the guy some kind of, you know...  We all would like to think that the world cares about us.  No one gives a shit.  Maybe a couple people really close to you care, and then the rest of us don't give a shit.  They care about me.  Right.  That's how it works in the end, unfortunately.  Sniper from Whackbag, and he puts a little TM in parentheses.  Mighty Putty couldn't fix his heart, so it went kaboom! 
[01:07:30]  Oh, kaboom.  Remember kaboom?  He did kaboom.  Flies away.  Mighty Putty.  Awesome auger.  Blue Heeler from Kentucky writes,  I like to think my wife would be beating on my chest even if I was cold.  Yeah, you'd like to think, you know...  You know, give it the old college try.  Right.  If you're dead, what is it going to hurt?  A little elbow grease.  Exactly.  What's going to happen?  What's the worst that's going to happen?  He gets a pulse?  All right, you turn me around.  I think they should have, yeah, done something. 
[01:08:00]  They should have done something.  It's the plate that grates.  Imagine Billy Mays is hovering above going,  You motherfuckers!  You're not even trying to get my spirit back down into my body?  I'm hanging out here.  I'm hanging.  The light's right there.  I'm in limbo, you fuckers.  Will you start pounding on my chest?  We're looking at the grater plate.  What the fuck is that?  It's a plate with, like, nubs in it,  so you can grate in the plate. 
[01:08:30]  What a worthless product.  What are you talking about?  Of course it is.  Where do you store all this shit?  Obviously...  That's just that you put it up in a...  You order it, you might use it once,  and then you just throw it up in a cabinet and never use it again.  Obviously, these products aren't for people that live in New York City.  You know, Harvey...  I can't even store four stupid fucking cereal bowls  and a couple of coffee cups in my kitchen.  Oh, it can't hurt a balloon or a kid's hand.  Really?  Why the hell do I want it?  Really?  I want to just rub it on top of a kid's head like a yarmulke.  The soft spot. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, they like that fake blood.  They're showing bad footage of someone hurting themselves,  grating injury.  Yeah.  Who's ever had a grating injury?  No one.  Very difficult.  Chocolate, cinnamon, coconut, nutmeg.  You could do anything with this grater plater.  When's the last time you had to fucking shred coconut or nutmeg?  I need something to shred nutmeg, and I have nothing to do with it.  The party's ruined.  Idiocy.  It's brilliant, though, because people see this and go,  Oh, I need that.  And then, like Ant said, you use it once, and then you're done with it. 
[01:09:30]  Throw it away.  You use it when it comes out of the box.  You're like, All right, let's grate something.  We got the grater plate.  We got to grate something.  And you grate some dumb thing,  and then you throw it in the cupboards forever.  I wonder if the fucking...  And then someone finds it when you're dead.  I wonder if the Just for Men hair dye is poisonous.  Maybe that's it.  50 years old, not one fucking gray hair in that beard.  We got that nice dark beard going, huh?  And the hair.  Same thing. 
[01:10:00]  Let's say hi to Mike in Syracuse.  Mike?  Yeah, did it ever occur to anyone that she was just excited she was going to be one rich cunt,  and she just won all his money, so she didn't want to wake him up?  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Punch down.  Wow.  Wow, that's a bit harsh.  That's ridiculous, too.  It was her fifth 911 call.  You hear, like, the other ones, you hear them going, like,  I think he's dead.  Yeah.  Ma'am, just shake him.  No.  Is the tool bandit a magnet, and you put it on your arm, 
[01:10:30]  and then all your tools stick to it.  Oh, boy.  Why would you ever need that?  How much work are you doing around the house?  Horrendous.  That's the cool thing about that show, Pitch Men,  because they would show the inventors of these products,  and they'd tell their story, like, how they came up with it.  I hear Pitch Men is a great show.  So I remember this one.  I got to watch that.  He was watching his father, you know, hammer nails,  and he was putting the nails in his mouth to hold them,  and then the inventor just goes, 
[01:11:00]  and I saw my dad do that, and I just said,  there has to be a better way.  Yeah.  I'll put magnets in his mouth.  Yeah.  No dummy.  We got horrific CPR phone calls coming in.  This rules.  Pat in Nebraska, what's up?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hey, Pat.  Hey, my brother and I got a call from my nephew,  and he had said my sister had committed suicide,  so we went over to her house,  and she had suffocated herself in a plastic bag.  Oh.  And I pulled the bag loose, 
[01:11:30]  and I tell you what, after I saw that,  there's no way you could perform CPR.  Why?  She was completely purple, and the bag was full of fluid.  What was the fluid?  She threw up, or was it like carbon dioxide?  I suppose she leaked in there,  probably threw up or something.  I don't know.  But I just grabbed my brother and dragged him out of the room,  and I said, there's no way.  We're not even going to.  She's gone.  Who could do that?  Like, that's a really rough way to go.  People who can commit suicide by putting a bag over their own head.  Well, that's a banger. 
[01:12:00]  But to be able to not pull the bag off your head.  I know.  Well, I've got an uncle that's a pretty curious alcoholic,  and he said that a good alcoholic knows about when they're going to pass out,  and she probably drank to that point, put the bag on,  and passed out inside the bag.  Oh, and that's why she puked.  Oh, okay.  Gotcha.  That sucks, bro.  Sorry about that.  You bet.  So weak.  All right.  Should have tried some OxiClean to clear out those arteries.  That's Trey.  Yeah, that's what everybody would say.  That's the big one, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Allen in Jersey. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah, I was listening to the grater pit thing there,  and I didn't understand why would you need a grater  when everything is grated already in the grocery store for you.  It's not as fresh that way, sir.  Yes.  We all like our own nutmeg.  We all like to grate our own nutmeg, sir.  What century are you in?  Yeah, come on.  It's fun.  What was the product we were looking at where they show the equivalent,  the product we all use, and then it's like,  oh, how do you work this?  It's pretty much like everything.  But what was the one?  We did it a couple weeks ago, 
[01:13:00]  and it was the most simple thing that none of us have ever had a problem with,  and they show the person on the commercial fumbling with it.  I don't know how to work this thing.  There's a blanket for the Snuggie.  Oh, it must have been the Snuggie.  Oh, that's what it was.  She couldn't figure out how to use the blanket.  How many people could use a blanket?  Her head's out one side.  My feet come out the other side.  I need a Snuggie.  That's what it was.  She couldn't figure out how a blanket worked.  But everything is real.  And the toilet paper thing, too,  where people are showing like they're going,  oh, ow, like they're hurting their arm,  trying to wipe their ass. 
[01:13:30]  Right.  All right.  We got a guy that works in a funeral home.  Oh, great.  You want to go ghoulish or what?  I want someone to saw into a dead body today on our show.  What?  Why not?  It's crazy.  I want to hear one of those saws like zzzz.  The autopsy saw.  No?  No.  John in Maine.  John.  Creepy.  Yo.  Hey.  Hey, what's happening?  Hey.  Hey, I used to work for a funeral home,  and we got a call for an unattended death.  And I walked into the house. 
[01:14:00]  I couldn't find the body.  And then I turned around.  The guy's sitting in his armchair,  and he's like halfway leaned over trying to release the leg rest.  And he had a pack of cigarettes and half a bag of aspirin on the table next to him.  I don't know if he was trying to go for his aspirin,  but he died of a heart attack come to find out.  He had been there for a while, too,  and he smelled pretty rotten, I'll tell you that much.  He was pulling that little stick shifter thing on his lazy boy? 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, he was trying to go down a gear.  Wait, so it's called an unattended death?  Yeah, whenever somebody dies and there's nobody around to witness the death,  the state police call it an unattended death,  and they have to be at the scene of the death to assess,  like, make sure there's no foul play or anything like that.  Wow.  And then you have to go in the house and find the body?  Yeah.  That's fucking creepy. 
[01:15:00]  It was fucking weird because I couldn't find him.  Right.  And I'm like, what the fuck?  I'm like, there's nobody here?  And I turn around,  and all of a sudden he's just in his chair fucking halfway leaned over,  and his arm is all fucking purple.  Maybe he's trying to blow himself.  Yeah.  He used to recline until, you know.  To do what the body can't do anymore.  Really can't move like that anymore.  Thank you, John.  Yeah.  Yeah, here's a good point. 
[01:15:30]  Dave from Eatontown, cold, blue, and dead.  Would you want to put your lips on that?  Hell fucking no.  That's true.  That is a little gruesome.  Let's say hi to Mike M.  Mike M.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  Hey, man.  Hey, I'm a medic in the Northeast,  and on the inverse,  we went to a call once for,  it was supposed to be cardiac arrest,  but we got there,  and the 911 operator was telling the husband to do CPR on his awake wife on the floor. 
[01:16:00]  So, he was on the floor screaming while he was forcing her CPR.  She was awake.  She was awake and saying ouch every time he was pressing down on her chest.  Ow!  Ow!  Jesus.  Unbelievable.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  Thank you.  One more.  Trucker Dan.  Dan.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  What are you hauling today, by the way?  Actually, I'm not really sure. 
[01:16:30]  It's going to the big Home Depot.  Oh, I'm sorry.  It's Weed Eaters.  Yeah, sorry.  I'm driving across the country.  We need a whole truck of Weed Eaters?  Hey, I was going to tell you,  I've probably saved eight, seven or eight people with a first aid,  like Lifeguard, Heimlich, and CPR.  I don't get excited at all.  It's really strange.  I'm completely in control and unexcited when it happens.  It's just very strange.  But people around me are panicky. 
[01:17:00]  They don't do anything.  They just sit there and wave their hands like,  somebody help, and they don't know what to do.  They don't know what to do.  Because they never took a CPR class like yourself there.  I know, but it's important to do these things.  You know, I mean, it's important to learn these things because, you know,  I mean, I've probably saved maybe six of the eight people, you know,  maybe that I've performed it on, Heimlich especially.  I've got a good story, though, with my best friend's girlfriend. 
[01:17:30]  Now he's a preface to that.  I mean, I thought I'd make it a little more funny than usual.  Nicest breast you've ever seen in your life.  We were all sitting around, two girls, about six guys.  She's got a jawbreaker.  One of those things you suck on, huge.  She's sitting there sucking on it.  Somebody said something funny.  And she, like, laughed and sucked in on it.  Uh-oh, yeah.  That's never good.  And her eyes, like, got huge.  And I knew exactly what happened.  I was already, I was ready to go.  She got up, waving her hands, ran to the bathroom. 
[01:18:00]  Everybody sat there.  They looked over at her.  She was, like, panicking, running to the bathroom.  And everybody just sat there drinking their beers.  I walked right in behind her, gave her a Heimlich.  It didn't work the first time.  That's how huge this jawbreaker was.  I said, okay, get ready again.  I'm going to push real hard on the three.  Did it.  It popped out.  Her boyfriend was standing behind me at this point.  And she went running.  She came running into my arms, turned around, and just threw her arms around me. 
[01:18:30]  And just like her boyfriend didn't exist.  And then the rest of the night, she sat by me like I was her savior.  I mean, she would have died.  There's no doubt about it.  That thing was huge.  And when was it again?  It was a jawbreaker.  One of those things you suck on.  And do they really fly across the room?  Huh?  Does it really fly across the room?  You get some velocity behind that shit?  Oh, it might have bounced across the room.  It was a small bathroom, you know.  Yeah, sure.  It just shot up against the toilet or something.  The thing was huge, though, man. 
[01:19:00]  She would have died.  Yeah.  It took me twice to get it out.  The second time, I was like, uh-oh, it's coming out this time.  And I put, she said her breasts were sore for like three weeks.  Yeah.  Nice.  Deep massages.  But she tried, she was like, tried to make a move on me after that.  It was like this kind of strange thing.  But you're gay, so you said, no, I can't do this, right?  Well, I've always had a rule that the never mess with your best friends' women. 
[01:19:30]  I mean, I've always been that way.  I've always been that way.  I've never messed with my best friends' women ever when I could have on a couple occasions.  What is Florence Nightingale syndrome?  Is that a real thing?  Yeah.  It's when somebody saves your life, like a doctor or something like that.  And you get this connection with them.  Sometimes women fall in love with the men.  Sometimes men fall in love with the men because they saved them.  Things like that.  Yeah, exactly.  I mean, her boyfriend was trying to jump in there after I got the job. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, yeah.  I'm here now.  He grabbed me like he didn't exist.  I mean, it was kind of like, you know.  Dan, I liked your call, but at this point, everyone on Instant Feedback is saying, shut the fuck up already.  Yeah, we've all had more than our share of you.  We've had.  All right.  I thought it was pretty cool.  You had a nice breath.  And her breasts were different.  Dan.  We get it.  Modesty.  No, Dan, we liked the call.  We just got to edit you a little bit.  I know you're lonely out there on the road.  I know you're lonely out there on the road.  I know you're lonely out there on the road.  I know you're lonely out there on the road.  Yeah.  I mean, it's just a story I can't just tell in two sentences.  I'm sorry.  No, it still was a good story. 
[01:20:30]  Thank you, Dan.  All right, you got it.  I appreciate it.  That's an excellent 13-episode sitcom you just spit out.  I save lives and I squeeze titties.  Let's go to Tony.  And Tony is in his truck as well.  Tony.  Yeah.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hi, Tone.  I just wanted to let you know, figured you'd be interested to know that I'm carrying a load of cadavers.  Right now?  Yeah.  Where the fuck are the cadavers going?  And what do you need a load of them for?  Really? 
[01:21:00]  A load of cadavers going to the U.S. military.  I can't tell you where it's going, but it's going for ballistics testing.  Police just slam on the brakes so they all bump their little dead heads.  And all you hear is xylophone noises coming from the back of the truck.  Oh, my God.  Put it this way, boys.  When you donate your body to science, they could end up going to the U.S. military.  Dude, I already know that.  I read a book called Stiff.  If you like ghoulish books, read Stiff. 
[01:21:30]  It tells you everything they do with dead bodies, and you'll be amazed.  Are they going to shoot these for ballistic testing?  Yeah.  They use all different types of weapons.  They use air burst, new projectile like rifles, stuff like that.  When you sign away your loved one to science when they die, you're not, like, saying, well, I want him to be used in this way.  It's just a general thing, and then they decide.  Sometimes their organs aren't good.  Sometimes they put them on a bomb site.  Some of our relatives are being shot at after they die because they donated their bodies to science. 
[01:22:00]  That's absolutely true.  They put them in cars.  Oh, yeah, crash test dummies.  Crash test dummies.  Live crash test dummies.  Well, not live, but with, yeah, with cadavers.  Used to be live.  Sure.  Yeah, that definitely happens.  Fuck that.  Dude, I'm so much, I'm so about cremation now.  Really?  Oh, just fucking sprinkle me in a helicopter like Omar. 
[01:22:30]  I want to be fucking, I don't want my body rotting somewhere.  Jesus, this is some great calls.  I like the old-fashioned crypt.  Crotch critter saying that you don't grab tits to do the Heimlich.  I'm going to go under the tits, but I'm sure, I'm sure the tits come up when you push up like that.  You know, call me stupid, and I know you will just say stupid now, but.  Uh, I didn't realize so many people found their family members dead.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just thought, like, I don't know. 
[01:23:00]  That just didn't happen.  That's how it happens.  Yeah.  Uh, Ray the Trucker.  Ray.  With that vacuum.  Excuse me.  Hey, Onay, love you, love the show.  Major longer.  Very, very.  Yeah, I found my brother dead on Christmas Eve morning.  Passed out outside for hours.  Oh.  What'd he die of?  Was he drunk?  Frozen?  Yeah, there was alcohol, some prescription drugs, some, uh, heart problems.  But, uh, yeah, I called 911, and they wanted to know if I wanted to perform CPR. 
[01:23:30]  I agree with the previous caller.  Cold, dead, and blue is not what I want to put my lips on.  Yeah, I guess that's protocol with the, uh, 911 operators, but I think you, as a human being,  go, no, it's obvious this fucking guy's dead.  But, uh, but I guess they got an ass on the phone to cover their own ass.  It was interesting watching the paramedics arrive and run up there as if they were going  to save the day, and then the two of them kind of looked at each other when they saw  him with an aww, aww, aww, fuck it, look on their face. 
[01:24:00]  That aww, fuck it, look on their face.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, man ain't good.  All right, brother.  All right, boy.  Sponching out.  All right, man.  Sorry to hear about your brother.  Uh, let's go to Teresa in New York.  Teresa.  Hello.  Welcome aboard, Terry.  Good morning, guys.  I'm a pathologist in New York City, and I've done, like, tons of autopsies, but I just  wanted to let you guys know that in the New York City Medical Examiner's Office, they actually  use hedge clippers to cut open the bodies. 
[01:24:30]  Hedge clippers?  Hedge clippers.  Oh, my God.  Because you can get around the ribs easier.  Wow.  They use the saws to take out the brains, but they only use the hedge clippers to open  the bodies.  They do garden work with a scalpel.  Creeps.  Hedge clippers.  Anyway, that's all I just wanted to tell you, because I thought you'd find that interesting.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  Now everyone's calling about finding their fucking relatives dead.  I don't know how many more we can take.  Mike in Massachusetts. 
[01:25:00]  Mike.  This is Mike in Boston?  Yes.  Hi, Mike.  Good enough.  Anyways, I've got my father dead, taking a shit with a cigarette in his mouth, burnt  down to the ash, died of lung cancer.  Oh, really?  Wow.  Right to the end, he had his last cigarette, though.  That's pretty cool.  Yep.  Friggin' peds down, taking a dump with a cigarette in his mouth.  He died loving...  Doing what he loved, smoking and shitting.  Honestly, I'm an ex-smoker, but if I knew I was going to die in five minutes, I'd light  up and take a shit.  Did he leave a nice log? 
[01:25:30]  That would have been pleasurable.  Yeah.  Cigarette, a nice log, tapered dump.  The last thing you hear is kaplop.  Dead.  We have another 911 call.  We get these all the time.  Another guy not happy with his fast food order.  Oh, God.  Well, it may sound silly, but it landed a local man in jail, and it could have actually put  lives at risk.  Really?  That man and two of his friends were unhappy with their burger order at McDonald's  and felt like police should handle the situation for them.  They wouldn't stop calling 911, tying up the life-saving emergency line for nearly 20 minutes. 
[01:26:00]  It's Andrew Michelson's job to handle life and death calls, not calls over two patties  and special sauce.  I was at a McDonald's, I paid $10, and these guys gave me one burger and a fry and told  me to pull around.  Okay, this is not a 911 emergency.  I told him that he needed to talk to the manager and take it up with them because it wasn't something  the police was going to get involved with.  But the upset man and two of his friends kept calling 911 over and over. 
[01:26:30]  You're going to sue our office because you're calling in on 911 because they didn't give  you the correct student?  Okay.  Yeah, you f***ing center officer right here right now because I got f***ing cheated.  Fucking ignorant cocksucker.  Yeah, well, there you go.  That makes perfect sense. 
[01:27:00]  Thank you, Danny.  What is it?  They need to change?  Dummy.  What was he complaining about?  I could say a few things.  I heard cheese.  It sounds like...  I got cheated, I think you said.  Yeah, it sounds...  It's kind of weird, but it almost sounds like they didn't give him all of his food.  Like, he paid more money than what he got, and they wouldn't...  Like, I guess they were arguing, and they wouldn't help him out.  I don't know.  What is the difference, just to play devil's advocate, like, if that's a legitimate call,  like, if they don't give you the right amount of money back and they're refusing, 
[01:27:30]  what's the difference between that and just walking by someone who has money on their table  and just taking it off?  It's like they're f***ing stealing from you, and the option is I'm going to go in there  and knock somebody's f***ing teeth.  Now, I know 911 is not the answer, but it's like, how do you...  You know what you do?  You f***ing calmly talk to the manager and explain the situation, and I bet 99% of the  time it all works out in the end.  Because they just, you know, these dope f***ing managers there, unless they've got a stick 
[01:28:00]  up their ass, probably are just like, you know...  But I'm sure one of these f***ing guys, I can tell by his picture, he just looks like  a f***ing cocksucker.  Hey, where's my f***ing s***?  Motherf***er, what...  All right, shut up.  Good.  Ugh.  He started cursing, and, you know, we get that a lot, where people will, you know, try  to abuse us and take it out on us.  The three men made such a scene outside the drive-up window that other McDonald's customers 
[01:28:30]  started calling 911, fearing for the safety of restaurant employees.  Meanwhile, the upset men used a new tactic to get attention from dispatchers.  Oh my gosh, the lady at McDonald's has a gun pointed to somebody, and I'm going to send  the cops.  Do you have a gun to your head?  Yep, right now.  You're going to send the cops?  Yes, I'm going to send you a cop.  What is your name?  My name is Chelsea Martin.  Police say there was no gun.  They arrested 23-year-old Jeremy Martin for improper use of 911.  His two friends fled the scene. 
[01:29:00]  Dispatchers say the abusive, selfish 911 calls could have easily put other lives at risk  all over a hamburger.  I got robbed for my money.  Sir, you did not get robbed.  I'm going to disconnect with you now.  Oh, good.  This guy won't get anything, though.  And if there's three thugs outside your thing making like an $8 fucking beef, and if your  company fucked up, why wouldn't you just give them their change?  Unless they were wrong.  Yeah, at that point, fuck them.  Fuck them. 
[01:29:30]  God, that's annoying.  That happens too much.  The 911 thing.  Ignat, motherfucker.  Let's go to Larry.  Larry.  Yo.  Hi, Larry.  Hey, the guy said that they wanted him to pull around.  Is that right?  Yes.  Yeah.  Okay.  They have timers on their fucking drive-thru.  So, if they're there too long, the company gets a bad note that the guy's sitting there  too long.  So, they bring the rest of his food order out while he pulls around front. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah, I've had to do that before.  They tell you to pull up and you wait in a little area and then someone comes out with  your shit.  Yeah, and this dumb motherfucker doesn't get it.  It's a pretty easy system.  No, he doesn't.  All right, guys.  Dumb motherfucker.  All right, sir.  Well, the hedge clippers got a few people pissed off.  Mike in Chicago.  What do you got on the hedge clippers, Mike?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  That girl's completely full of shit.  They have very specialized tools.  They don't just grab garden implements to do an autopsy. 
[01:30:30]  She didn't sound much like a pathologist either.  I've done a bunch of autopsies.  She sounded like a freaking idiot.  They use something called a sternal saw that goes from the vertex all the way down to the  xiphoid process to open the rib cage.  Beyond that, there's a Y incision that goes right below the xiphoid process that they can  access all the other internals, pancreas, liver, intestines, et cetera.  All right, so is there a tool you guys use that looks kind of like hedge clippers? 
[01:31:00]  I can't think of anything like that.  The sternal saw looks just like a mini reciprocating saw.  Hold on.  Danny has one up on this thing here.  I've seen that, too.  That's the one that opens up.  It looks like a giant plier, but it opens up and probably snaps shut with a blade.  Yeah, this is called rib cutters?  Yeah, rib cutters.  Yeah, they're fat hedge clippers, though.  There's a, it's a, it's just a, it's a bone snip.  Is there a, it looks more like, if anything, it looks more like a pair of tin snips or something  like that.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:31:30]  Absolutely.  How strong are they?  Do you open them up and they snap shut or do you have to push them shut?  No, you, no, you have, you've got to apply force to cut through the bone.  Oh, oof.  Oh, God.  Good time.  Just like cutting a pair of baby back rib.  Does it make a nice snap, uh, sound when it snaps?  Oh, of course it does.  That was always a good feeling when you had to do like something with hedge clippers and  you finally got it.  Oh.  You know, it's pretty much the same.  Like a small, like a small, uh, branch or something like that.  Like pruning shears.  And sneak right through. 
[01:32:00]  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Love you guys.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, buddy.  We got some info on, uh, taking a shit from David in upstate New York.  What part of upstate New York, David?  Hey, Thousand Islands, uh, Oaks.  God damn, I love that area.  Hey, I love it.  Thousand Islands?  Oh.  Where is it?  I jet skied my ass off in between, uh, maybe a couple dozen of the Thousand Islands.  Is that where the dressing comes from?  Thousand Islands?  You've never seen Thousand Islands?  No.  You should look up pictures. 
[01:32:30]  Like, there's literally a thousand islands and a lot of them have just one little house  on them.  Right?  Am I lying?  Not much to do.  And you can't, you can't really visit your neighbors because it's a pain in the ass.  I like that.  You can't shop because it's a pain in the ass.  Basically, the island is big enough for, like, a house in a tiny little backyard and  that's it.  Oh, my God.  That's like...  Yeah, there you go.  Dude, that's sick.  How cool is that, though?  How do you not flood and die?  How cool is that?  That's for a lot of, uh...  We're looking at one, uh... 
[01:33:00]  ...to get away from.  I'm surprised Anthony hadn't built his compound up here yet.  You have to leave eventually for something.  Well, they all have, they all have boats and there's like a nearby town where you do a  little shopping.  I mean, it's, it's...  So your boat's like your car, I guess.  Yeah, pretty much.  But we're looking at one, it's, uh...  The whole island is pretty much the house.  It has one huge tree.  It's like...  It's a tiny house.  It's two stories, though.  Well, there's a fucking fire.  ...and a half.  It's like, uh...  It's a one story and then the attic.  Dude, I was jet skiing...  They're not tiny.  ...and you want to talk about seeing some cool shit. 
[01:33:30]  When you see these houses just on these islands, it's amazing.  Dude, that's...  You know how easy that'd be to rob?  You quietly sneak up on something, you fight with it, you break in, and...  Oh, that's awful.  They're mostly on...  They're mostly summer houses, obviously.  I mean, you know.  It's the same house.  How cool would that be, though?  You'd spend a weekend on a tiny little island in a house?  No.  Why not?  I don't want to.  Where does your duty go?  Be on a cruise ship.  Some of them look like, uh, you know, like, uh...  That's a big house.  Glorified lighthouses.  Yeah.  Some are bigger than others.  That's much nicer. 
[01:34:00]  Where does your duty go?  Does it go in the water?  Right into the water, Jimmy.  No.  Oh, you're not allowed to pump duty in the water.  Oh, yeah.  I was jet skiing right over duty.  Huh?  You have sewage systems built in.  Oh, okay.  Are you near, uh, Canada, David?  Yeah, Canada is right across, uh, St. Lawrence River.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What's the town over there?  I live in Clayton, which still holds the copyrights for the Thousand Island Dressing.  Yeah, I think I fucking, uh, did a little boating in your area.  Brother Wheeze, every once in a while, takes his boat all the way across to that area. 
[01:34:30]  Where is Thousand Islands, though?  It's like how, near Rochester?  It's like, uh...  The Thousand Islands runs in, uh...  There you go.  Danny's showing you.  It's like the northeast corner of Lake, uh, I always get them mixed up.  Lake Erie?  Or, no, Lake Ontario.  So, go out of Lake Ontario, northeast out of Lake Ontario, and you go up the St. Lawrence River.  There you go.  And you'll start hitting the, uh, the Thousand Islands, the Thousand Islands region.  I think I went in a couple miles, and I was, I was, I loved it, man.  It was a lot of islands. 
[01:35:00]  It was fucking cool.  Holy shit.  And some of them are national parks, so then you pull your jet ski up, and now you're just  wandering around a park.  There's no one else on the fucking island.  I feel like Gilligan all of a sudden.  Stupid and gay.  Yeah.  What do you got, David?  David?  I'll be real quick, and then I'll punch out.  Uh, when you take a shit, if you got a weak heart, you got, uh, any, I'm a medic, um,  it, but when you take a shit, you're depressing the vagal nerve, which rests back there in that 
[01:35:30]  area, and that just bottoms out your blood pressure.  That's how Elvis Presley died.  He was sitting on the crapper, and he took a shit, and probably all those fried, you know,  uh, uh, uh, Snickers bars that he ate, you know, because it's probably a hard turn.  Snickers bars.  But, uh, whatever it was, you know.  So, basically, you're saying if you take a shit and you have a bad heart, that could  be a bad combination.  It is.  I mean, in fact, in cardiac units, they'll tell, uh, cardiac patients, if they have to 
[01:36:00]  go to the bathroom, a nurse has to pretty much, well, either A, be there to escort them, or  they have to have a pull rope in case they fall off the toilet so that somebody can be there  to assist them very quickly.  Right.  Um, so the next thing I gotta ask you real quick is, uh, what, uh, F.H. Rowley was, uh,  named after your niece and your father.  Yeah.  What was your father's name?  Fred.  Great.  That's one more piece of trivia I know.  And I named Fred.  Yeah, I was supposed to be Frederick Wilford Hughes III. 
[01:36:30]  Primly.  There's a little trivia for you.  My mom said, hell, fucking no.  We're not naming our son Frederick Wilford Hughes III.  Why not?  F.W.  Hughes sounds rich.  Hell, fucking no.  F.W.  Hughes III?  Sounds like you have money.  Harumph, harumph.  My mom did the right thing.  I don't want to go through life as a Fred.  No offense to the Freds out there.  I, I, I, one of my best friends' name is Fred.  I hate the fucking name.  You wouldn't be a Fred.  You'd be an F.W.  And then you'd be the, you'd be the head of a board, uh, of a board somewhere. 
[01:37:00]  Yes.  F.W.  Hughes III entering the room.  In charge of cement bags for lunch.  Sounds very, uh, fancy.  Yeah.  Does it?  Jimmy, did you enjoy whacking off in your trailer?  I did.  Oh, yeah, I did actually.  Are you whacked off in the trailer?  I, I jerked off for like 10 minutes and a bunch of fucking kids came by and I, and  I, and they, like, they pounded on my fucking door and I was like.  That's when you came?  Yeah.  Hi.  You jerked off before you went on the movie set?  Uh, yeah, but I didn't come.  Wouldn't that make you tired?  Didn't matter.  I, you know, I was okay. 
[01:37:30]  I was gonna be sitting for my scene.  I get tired after that shit.  Hey, a while I have a question and I'm punching out.  Anthony, what were you drinking the other night when you were on, uh, well, uh, uh, uh,  whatever it is you do?  Every time, um, I have a beer, it's, uh, Bud Light.  Unless, you know, it's a Guinness, but that's the weekends.  Well, okay, wasn't a Guinness, that's what I noticed, so.  Yeah.  Bud Light?  Bud Light.  It's like lemonade.  Okay.  Thank you, guys.  Punch it out.  Out of here.  What the fuck was that about?  Too many personal questions. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah, another fucking stalker.  What is he, profile?  Jesus.  You got a stalker?  I don't know what the fuck's going on.  Guy decides to just come over my house.  What?  You had a guy come over your house?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Really?  Yeah, listener.  Just fucking comes by.  You're kidding, right?  Found out where I lived.  Knocked on the door?  Knocked on the door.  I answered the door.  I'm like, uh.  Did he invite him in?  How you doing?  He goes, oh, I just figured, you know, so you're home, and.  Wow.  I was like, yeah, um, all right, you want a beer?  You bring him in? 
[01:38:30]  In the back.  I figured, you know, I don't know.  I didn't know at that point.  Way to discourage him.  I didn't know at that point what to do.  Your door's going to be ringing all day now.  No, no, no, no, because I made a point after that.  I mean, yeah, isn't that great?  Yeah, that's wonderful.  What?  There you go.  That's nice.  Oh.  That's just beautiful.  So, um, yeah, yeah, thank you for that.  Can you be blocked from that?  I think that could be dealt with, yeah, to tell you the truth. 
[01:39:00]  Um, yeah, I'll get right on that.  Jesus Christ.  Anyway, yeah, so, but I'm thinking, okay, there's two ways I could go here.  I could, you know, tell him, hey, look, shove, take off, I'm busy,  or I'm doing, or whatever, and, um.  Well, you could say, sure, I'll be happy to sign that album, Mr. Chapman.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  I figured it would be a better way to find out who this is and what they're up to, you 
[01:39:30]  know, and to maybe discourage other things by showing that I'm really not to be fucked  with because I did come to the door fully loaded as, see, and I say it all the time.  I go, people fucking, they laugh, they call me a maniac because I'm fucking got a .40  caliber on my hip when I'm in my house, but then 9.30 at night, someone's knocking on  the door, I open the fucking door up, there's some guy, I don't know, from a hole in the 
[01:40:00]  fucking wall.  So what the fuck?  And I didn't even have an over shirt because I'm at home, so I don't have to fucking conceal  at home.  So I'm just standing at the fucking door, I got a pistol on my hip, and I'm fucking  like, hello, can I help you?  Why are you opening the door, man?  Why aren't you talking through, like, a little intercom system?  Because you can't shoot people through an intercom system.  No, but you can find out who they are.  I'm teasing, of course.  No, I kind of look through the little window thing, and then I open the door. 
[01:40:30]  You don't have an intercom system?  Not right at the front door.  I got one, like, if somebody rings that little bell, I can talk to them from the phone.  I can pick up the phone and be like, hey, so if I'm upstairs in the room, I can kind of  talk to downstairs, shit like that.  But, no, so he comes over and then he sits down and having, you know, a beer, and Danny  was there, which was good, you know.  Was he a psycho Danny?  Well, to be perfectly honest, I had no idea that this guy was just some dude, because 
[01:41:00]  it was very, like, the conversation was very flowy and natural.  See, I was getting info and seeing what he knew, and apparently he knew a lot about, like,  my past and my stuff, but stuff that I've said on the show.  Maybe it's an old friend.  No, because I said, I go to John Glenn or something like that, and he goes, no, I went  to Half Hollow Hills.  I'm like, I didn't know anybody from Half Hollow Hills.  But he knew, like, that I used to hang out at, like, the House of Beer in Elwood and shit 
[01:41:30]  like that.  And it was little things like that.  He knew some people that I knew, but, and then he was like, oh, yeah, you with that black  bicycle.  And I'm like, what the fuck?  Like, what?  And...  He just knew you from the past.  He knows...  No, dude.  I don't know this fucking guy.  I don't know the name.  I don't know...  I don't know this guy.  But then the creep...  The part that really started to creep me out was he said something like, he's like,  yeah, I drove by some other time.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, yeah.  He's like, yeah, the lights were on, but yeah, I didn't come by. 
[01:42:00]  She's like, why are you doing that?  He fucking...  And I found this out.  That's creepy.  He twittered my sister and said, like, I went by Anthony's house just a little worried.  The music's blasting and the lights are on.  His truck's out front, but I can't find him.  I'm like, yeah, maybe I'm fucking fucking.  Or maybe I'm fucking, like, down in the movie theater or in the studio or somewhere.  And yeah, I have the music blasting because I'll be up in a minute or... 
[01:42:30]  It was a complete...  Like, why would she worry?  Why would you worry my sister, too?  Like, worrying my fucking sister, saying I was just a little worried.  Like, don't fucking worry my family because my lights are always on.  I have a $1,200 electric bill.  Wow.  And it was a complete Rupert Pupkin moment.  I'm having a heart attack over here.  I'm having a heart attack.  It's like, yeah, come in.  And I was so taken aback. 
[01:43:00]  He got his phone out at one point and he was just like,  God, let me just call my house.  And then he's just like, hey.  He's like, oh, did I wake you?  Oh, here, wait.  I got someone to talk to you.  That's the fucking worst.  Yeah, no, I'm in his backyard.  And then it's like, yeah.  And then he puts his daughter on the phone.  And then I'm just like, hi, yeah.  And all the time I'm just kind of assessing the situation and realize I'm like, there's  just something a little off here.  This is a little weird. 
[01:43:30]  So I just kept talking about my extensive gun collection and how I constantly have.  How did you get rid of them?  I was like, well, I'm, you know, wow, it's getting a little late.  Yeah, it's time to go.  And he was like, yeah, I'd love to check out, you know, the, what you got going on downstairs.  I was like, yeah, it's late.  Check out what's going on downstairs.  What?  Get out of here.  You had him in the, wow, he would have never made it anywhere near my stuff. 
[01:44:00]  Well, no one knows where you live.  Well, it doesn't matter.  Can't get past you a doorman.  You should just tell him to freaking go.  You're busy.  Well, that's one of the things.  I wasn't sure what the move was.  How about he calls the show and find out, let's find out what that was about.  He called another program that I was on.  And I had a discussion with him about the whole thing and how weird it was.  And, you know, and then he was saying stuff like, well, you got to understand my side  of it, too, because it was weird for me to be able to, you know, to come up like that. 
[01:44:30]  It's like, well, then maybe you shouldn't have done it.  I told you what you had to do.  What?  I'm not saying on the air.  I told you what you have to do last time I was there.  Oh, get somebody to walk the perimeter?  Well, that would be good, but no.  I told you what to do.  Can I have a doorman?  It's obvious now.  Gated?  Yes.  I agree with all.  Gate up?  Yes, you can.  Yes, that's what people do.  I can.  Why can't you?  It's a fucking town.  You're not allowed to put a front fence up?  No fucking way you're allowed to put a front fence up. 
[01:45:00]  Come on.  Welcome to suburbia.  I had to fucking go to get a six-foot fence in my backyard for a pool.  What about all those other towns that have?  You have special circumstances.  No, it doesn't matter.  It's not a gated.  Every time you see a nice gate, you know, someone of fame lives there.  It's obvious.  I don't, it's, it's, I'm fine.  Believe me.  I consider myself pretty well protected, to tell you the truth.  I really do. 
[01:45:30]  Not quite.  But I just thought that was like the oddest fucking thing to have happen.  But yeah, it's, it's the, what it is, it's the scourge of the new technology.  It's just what it is.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  But I know who it is.  I got, you know, names.  I got pictures.  I got everything else.  Well, you should call the show and let's find out what the fuck that's all about.  It's like people get like a little overzealous.  Like I have to think to myself, how would, how would I be if I knew where, say, uh, De Niro lived 
[01:46:00]  and I knew I could knock on the door when he opened it because I had Paul Stanley's cell  phone.  Dice gave me Paul Stanley's cell phone.  And, uh.  You didn't call it.  I did.  I blocked the number.  Did you hang up right after?  I just wanted to hear the message once.  I only called it one time and I heard his outgoing message and that was it.  I never called again.  I'm not going to hassle him.  It was one time and done.  Um, and if he would have answered, I would have just asked for another person and I never  would have bothered him again.  Yeah.  But I had to make the call once.  So if I knew where Paul lived or De Niro or Ozzy Osbourne, I would probably, but I 
[01:46:30]  wonder if Paul Stanley is okay with you calling at once.  You know what I mean?  No.  Why would he be?  He doesn't know me.  I mean, we interviewed him once.  He'd probably go, oh, hi.  Like, what the fuck do you want?  Yeah.  It's invasive.  It's inappropriate.  A lot of people are saying they'll be stopping by your house later this weekend.  All right.  They're very excited now that, now that you set a precedent.  Cool.  Precedent.  This guy, uh, uh, him and his boys will be up to see you this weekend.  Okay.  This guy wants to know what you're doing later. 
[01:47:00]  Very good.  I guess you did what you thought, you know, you should do at the time.  I did.  I would have been too freaked out.  To me to go like, hey, what are you doing?  Get out of here.  Would seem to me to maybe if there was going to be a problem to bring out aggression.  And then I'd have been like looking over my shoulder the whole time, like leaving and  everything like that, which I do anyway.  But, um, it just would have seemed to me to be a little more hostile if I would have done  it that way than to just go, all right, um, let me do it this way. 
[01:47:30]  Uh, I'll gather up some info.  If I send some guy away, I don't know who the fuck he is, where he's from, what he's doing.  Now I got all the information that I, I, I need, uh, to get any kind of complete background  check or, or anything like that on this guy.  I got all the info.  I got name.  I got, uh, picture.  I got, uh, apparently he follows, uh, everybody on, uh, Twitter also. 
[01:48:00]  You're there.  Mm-hmm.  Jimmy.  Dan.  Travis.  Everyone's followed.  By the way, except me.  Mm-hmm.  It's very odd.  Why?  I don't know.  Isn't that weird?  Yes.  Yeah.  Very weird.  You have interesting tweets.  Hmm?  You have interesting tweets.  Like, why wouldn't they follow you?  I don't know.  Well, I don't know why he doesn't.  He probably does under a different Twitter name.  Maybe it's a different Twitter name.  Perhaps.  I, I don't know. 
[01:48:30]  But, um, I, I was sent, like, an email last night from somebody that had some contact with,  uh, this guy and said he was, uh, you know, a little off kilter at certain times.  Being a little weird with certain, uh, message board posts and, and things like that.  Hmm.  So now I'm just kind of like, all right, well, what are you going to do?  That's why I like having security in my building.  Not that he's a dangerous guy, but it shows you that you can. 
[01:49:00]  But then again, you know what?  You can, dangerous people can be anywhere.  It's a, it really is.  We're public figures, quote unquote.  Well, that's what it is.  You know, you, you public figure, uh, people feel this, I don't know what it is.  They really do feel like they are entitled to pop by or something.  It's, it's like, and then to, to, to tell me that he came by on like Father's Day and,  uh, I wasn't there, but the lights were on and the music's playing it.  And then to Twitter my sister and tell her that, like what that, it's completely not 
[01:49:30]  his place.  And then to, you know, I didn't even talk to my sister about this.  She never mentioned to me, but I, you know, maybe you worried her with that need to do.  I always have my lights and music on.  What the fuck am I doing?  You know, he's doing something more importantly, Matt has a very good point here.  Uh, Matt on long Island.  Yeah.  The saddest part of this story is that Anthony stalker has been over his house as many times 
[01:50:00]  as Opie has.  That's funny.  Uh, God damn John from, um, John on the phone.  Oh yeah.  Let me go.  We'll go there.  Tim in Atlanta, Tim.  Hey, good morning.  Anthony, I've got the perfect solution for you.  Yeah.  A giant black man that carries the umbrella for Michael Jackson is looking for work.  You need to hire him for security.  Ah, there you go.  Yeah.  He's out of work, Ant.  All right.  Check it out, guys.  Let's go to John who's calling from, uh, Ant's house. 
[01:50:30]  John.  Yeah.  We can't figure out how to turn off that Guinness tap and the damn projector.  How do you turn that on?  You need some help?  All right.  I'll, I'll, I'll, uh, send Keith over.  He'll help you.  Let's go to, uh, Tom in Stony Brook.  Tom.  Hey, what's up, boys?  How you doing?  Hey, man.  All right.  Hey, Ant, I hope, uh, I hope when I come over this weekend I see a little fine out front that says,  your trespasses will be shot.  Yeah.  Wasn't he commenting that my NRA sticker was, should have been near the doorbell? 
[01:51:00]  For all of you that have been to Anthony's house, he has this big, you know, like double  doors and, uh, there's an NRA sticker and the guy had commented when he came in, he goes,  yeah, he's like, you know, you got that NRA sticker on the left, but no one's going to  see it because the doorbell's on the right.  And I didn't really think about it so much at first, but then later on it was running  through my head and I was like, this fucking guy, he was peeking in through those windows  and that's how he saw the sticker.  Exactly.  Because he was looking through those, those side windows.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like what a fucking creep.  And then he's like bad mouthing ex-girlfriends to the point where, yeah, yeah. 
[01:51:30]  To the point where it's like, it's like, what are you fucking like, what do you know  that you can just talk like this?  It's, it, it was really odd.  Me and Danny are just texting back and forth the whole time.  He brought up something like, you know, from my personal life and I was just like, well,  uh, that's something I don't feel like talking about.  Hey Danny, what about, you know, this situation or this?  And Danny goes, well, you know, I don't feel like talking about that.  But there's a weird aggression in people sometimes like, cause I know it's, it's weird. 
[01:52:00]  It's like, you know what it's like to be a hardcore fan of something.  And, and then I know, I know the difference between somebody who's a hardcore fan and loves  what, you know, the show or whatever, the act.  And then there are people who have a very weird aggression.  And, uh, again, I don't know who this guy is, but I've, I've had that with, with certain  people too.  It's a weird interaction where it's like, if you do the slightest thing they don't like,  there's an aggression that comes out of them.  And it's like, yeah, you know, you're not as much a fan as you are.  Yeah.  Something else.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was, that's what it was. 
[01:52:30]  And that's what I was picking up because from what I was told last night and what I was  shown, um, certain posts and things like that, it was like, okay, there's some kind  of, you know, passive aggressiveness going on here.  And this weird kind of, you know, getting into arguments with certain people that are friends  of mine and things very odd on the nosey. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  Should we take a break?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Take a break.  We got to discuss a couple of things.  All right.  O.P.  Can I welcome everyone back? 
[01:53:30]  James, if you would.  Welcome to Norton and Friends.  Norton and Friends.  Why?  Featuring my friend, Anthony Kulmia and my friend, Opie, who is, uh, right now taking  a nice dump.  I bet.  Taking a nice hurry.  It's always weird when you walk in the bathroom.  And I think that's where Opie was, but I walk in and there's only one stall door closed. 
[01:54:00]  So I want to start talking to him, but I'm like, Opie?  It's so creepy to call your friend's name while he's shitting.  Hello?  That's why you got to just peek underneath.  Yeah.  Hi.  Yeah.  It's your face down there with a nice smile.  I put my dick under and he tooted on it with his hand.  I'm like, all right, it's him.  Tootily toot.  He gave it a little squeeze.  I passed by the studio and I didn't see Opie there.  I hope everything's okay.  Yeah.  I hope he's taking a little bit of a, uh, dumpy, dumpy, wumpy. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  It's going to make a short break.  I took a piss and I came back and it's time to be on the radio again.  Yes.  And Sean William Scott is coming here.  Yeah.  When is he?  Um, oh, today.  Oh my God.  Yeah.  About an hour and a half.  A, uh, a co-star.  I thought it was.  In the, uh, motion picture that, uh, James is in.  Yes.  He's, uh, supposedly he's very funny at it.  I haven't seen, I was, I did not have my scene with him, but, uh, I read the whole script  while I was getting my fake tattoos put on.  Yeah.  Which you still have on.  It's easy to say it's fucking, this, I, I honestly got laughed out loud reading the script. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah, good.  Fucking hilarious.  You never read funny scripts.  They're always terrible.  Um, but, uh, this is a really funny fucking script and you can hear Tracy Morgan in every  Tracy Morgan line.  Oh, it's totally written.  Like, obviously he should be saying the, uh, the line.  Yeah.  Oh, cool.  Yeah.  And you were there for, how long are you on that too?  Cause I, I know like it takes a long time to film like a short little segment. 
[01:55:30]  Well, they didn't, they didn't know on there for a while.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  I, I was, it was, uh, it was about a 10 hour day, 11 hour day.  Really?  Yeah.  And, uh, that's cool.  I didn't know what time I took off yesterday because, uh, I was like, well, we didn't  know that they originally, they said it was going to be an early call.  Then they said it was going to be noon.  And then they said it was going to be early again.  So I was like, eh, let me just fucking, you know, and they wound up making it earlier.  So I had to be there.  I got picked up at like, uh, 11 o'clock, which was actually much later than I was thinking.  And, uh, get there at noon. 
[01:56:00]  I'm in the makeup channel about two 30.  And, uh, is it done out in the street?  Oh, no, no, no.  Not the one I did was inside of a tattoo parlor.  Oh, okay.  But was it like a real tattoo parlor?  Oh, yeah.  In New York City.  In Brooklyn.  In fucking Bensonhurst.  You've never seen so many white people in your life.  They don't play games out there.  Oof.  Spike Lee has a point.  I think that's who we were.  They don't fuck around.  Oh, they were fucking hardcore, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They were great, but they were hardcore fucking Italians. 
[01:56:30]  You didn't play games.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Were there a lot of, uh, uh, people like trying to.  It was a fucking mob scene.  Looky-loos.  It was a mob scene outside of, because my friend Rob and his brother Mark wrote the film.  And, uh, and Rob goes, it's a fucking zoo.  Everywhere we go, it's a zoo.  And they're actually being polite.  The crowds are not being animals.  They're not yelling and screaming.  But they're all just standing outside waiting to see Bruce or Tracy.  They want to see a big star.  Yeah.  It was great to just walk out there and be a nobody.  People are like, who's that? 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  A couple of fans came over and said hello.  And, you know what I mean?  So there were some O&A fans, but they were across the street.  And, uh, yeah, but it was, uh, they roped off those mooks and kept them out of the,  out of the, uh, out of the picture.  I had to play scared.  I'm like, I don't know how to play scared.  I'm not good at that.  And, uh, would you fart?  I was scared.  This is how I play scared.  And I was sitting, I had to sit in, uh, uh, the tattoo chair and, and I'm not going to  give away the whole scene, but let's just say that Bruce Willis, the scene is supposed  to start with him holding a tattoo needle over my eye. 
[01:57:30]  Wow.  Threatening me.  Awesome.  And, uh, I'm like, eh, I don't know if I should play this scared or aggressive.  So they're like, all right.  So they lay me back in the chair and fucking, and Tracy Morgan, Tracy is actually lying over  me.  He was actually hurting me because I had worked out the day before, you know, trying to  get the guns in shape.  Of course.  It really was like jogging fucking from here to the corner the day before the marathon.  Is that, you really worked out the day before?  The two days before I did cardio and swimming.  And then I did some elliptical.  I'm like, oh, this will make me look great on film. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  This will buff me up.  You should have just done, did pushups just before you're seeing a pump up a little bit.  There was no room in my trailer.  It was like the fucking, it wasn't even the one I had on Zach and Mary was a fucking,  it was Anthony's house compared to what I had yesterday.  It was literally like, if you lean forward, you banged your head on the other wall.  And you had to share a common bathroom at the end trailer.  With Bruce?  No, I don't think so.  No, huh?  No, Bruce actually just shit on copies of my headshot and resume.  Smearing it in nice. 
[01:58:30]  But, uh.  That's fucking cool, man.  He was, we rehearsed and he literally, Tracy's laying on top of me and, and, and Bruce has  his hand on my fucking forehead and he's just standing over me with this fucking needle  over my eye.  And he was fucking so nice and safety.  He, all he wanted to make sure is that I didn't jab my eye out.  Right.  So he's like, uh, Hey, can you, can you see Jimmy's feet here?  He made them build something on the end of this chair.  He looks a little short, but wait, he's going to fall off the back. 
[01:59:00]  And he made them actually put clamps and build something on the end of this chair so I could  brace my feet as in the, during the struggle.  So I wouldn't actually slide down and get my fucking eye poked.  Oh, wow.  He was great, man.  He was fucking a surprisingly nice dude.  Fucking John McClain.  Yeah.  But you think of that too.  It's like after a few minutes, you get used to it, but then he leaves and he comes back  in and you're like, where's Bruce?  Oh, there he is.  And you realize, and he, like, he asked me to dab my forehead at one point cause I was 
[01:59:30]  sweating.  Oh no.  His hand is getting all sweaty on you.  Yeah.  My fucking greasy head.  Poor Bruce.  Could you wipe your fucking greasy?  Oh God.  I don't want to interrupt this cause we could do this.  Oh no.  Do you want to take that?  It's up to you.  Uh, no, it probably, it's probably, it's, he probably shouldn't, right?  I don't know what you mean.  I'm thinking.  You already put it out there, so.  Okay.  Yeah. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah.  Actually, good.  Recorded.  It'll help me.  It'll help me with certain licensings.  Yeah, go ahead.  Hi.  Hello, Anthony.  Hi.  How are you, sir?  I'm fine.  Let's just put things in perspective here.  All right.  Let's do that.  Okay.  You came to my house in the middle of the night.  Okay.  We had spoken a number of times on your other thing.  You knew I knew where your house was cause we had spoken about it. 
[02:00:30]  You invited me over.  You said to me, if the music is on.  I said that to get rid of you.  No, you, you said ring the doorbell.  I did.  You said, sure, come up and ring the doorbell.  You, you said that.  Anthony.  Anthony invites somebody and they show up like crazy.  Let's, let's put another thing into perspective.  I wasn't just standing at your door.  I was leaving.  I was, I rang your doorbell.  No one came to the door.  I was getting in my truck 50 feet away from your front door when you came to the door. 
[02:01:00]  That's cause Danny came back and said, someone's at your door, dude.  So I opened the door to see who the fuck was at my door.  And the person was leaving with me.  I was getting in my truck and leaving.  And then you invited me.  I walked up to the door.  No, I said, hello.  Can I help you?  Okay.  So I walked up to the door.  Right.  I explained who I was.  You invited me in and said, would you like a beer?  Exactly.  You brought me down.  You brought me into the house, down to the basement and poured me a beer. 
[02:01:30]  Right.  Okay.  I was being cordial.  The thing is, if anything, I was the one that said I was going to leave.  When we were out back and you guys were getting ready for the show, I'm like, I'm getting out of here.  I wasn't told to leave.  I said, you know, enough.  If I'm not, look, I'm not.  Wait, wait, wait.  I said, I, I looked at my watch and went, yeah, I think I'm going to get doing the show.  Right.  If anything, in the discussions we were having, wasn't I even saying to you, aren't you going to do the show? 
[02:02:00]  And you were even saying, yeah, these people are getting all over me.  Yeah, yeah, that, that was my, yeah, yeah.  You know, you're right.  Hey, maybe I should have handled it different.  Maybe I should have said, you know, just maybe go away.  I have no idea.  What, what are you, what are you getting at?  I'm just saying, I thought it was.  I apologize if I scared you in any way.  But I mean.  No, you didn't, you didn't scare me in any way.  I never rang the doorbell if you didn't say to me a couple of weeks ago when we had a discussion on air and you knew I knew where your house was.  And I said.  Yeah, exactly. 
[02:02:30]  That was the, that was the kicker right there was that you knew where my house was.  And you still said to me after the fact that you, I knew where your house was that, yeah, if the music is on and the lights are on in the backyard, ring the doorbell.  I didn't bring that up.  You did.  All right, so I mean.  This guy's getting a little.  I don't want to make a whole radio play out of this thing.  It's just, that's exactly the way it was.  A little confrontational.  And I'm not a problem.  And it's going to be a one and done.  You won't have to worry about me coming over there ever again. 
[02:03:00]  You pretty much just kind of like you're a fan of the show and you just kind of wanted to meet Ant and you said, what the hell, I'll give it a shot.  Sherry.  All right.  No, I'm sorry I'm asking you.  Like, you're just a piece of a fan.  I mean, you know, it goes back to where I initially was a Howard Stern fan.  And when I started listening to the show for the first time, I started realizing, like, wait a minute, this guy knows a lot of people that I used to know.  He grew up exactly where I grew up.  So, yeah, it intrigued me.  I think it would intrigue anybody.  No.  And, I mean, that's all it is.  It's not an obsession. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah, I mean, look, I'll say this.  If I had the, like I said, the chance to go by someone's house just to, you know, I might do it.  You know, it's not that crazy.  I mean, if he had not said to me, ring the doorbell, I never would have done it.  See?  Anthony, I've known where your house is for the last three or four years.  See, don't you find that a little weird to just say and blurt out every maybe five minutes that you know where I live? 
[02:04:00]  Don't you, do you think me, as a person that is in the public eye, likes to hear people constantly tell me they know where the fuck I live?  Do you know, do you understand that's a little disheartening to me?  It's a little fucking weird to me, not just that people do know where I live, but that for someone to bring it up this many times is a little weird.  Do you understand that, maybe?  Well, then maybe you shouldn't be inviting that person over. 
[02:04:30]  Can you understand that's a little weird?  Do you understand I say certain things, and you're absolutely right.  Maybe I should shut my fucking mouth that I say certain things.  And if you watch Rupert Pupigan and the King of Comedy, you'll see that Jerry once told Rupert, yeah, come by or do this or do that.  And he took it literally.  Anthony, that was a movie.  It's my whole fucking thing.  This is real.  My whole MO.  Yeah, exactly.  This is real.  My whole MO is, you know, all right, I'll say things.  I never think people are actually going to fucking at 930 at night or whatever it was, knock on my fucking door. 
[02:05:00]  That's what I mean.  So, you know something, yes, I've been educated very valuably, very valuable education from you, sir, that I will never again bring that up.  The fact that you kept telling me you knew where I lived, I was trying to appease you a bit because you kept...  By saying if you see the lights on and you hear the music blasting, ring the doorbell.  That's appeasing? 
[02:05:30]  That's amazing.  Yes, that's appeasing.  That's appeasing because I didn't think anyone in their right mind would actually do that.  But, okay.  I mean, just to kind of mention that you've been around before and...  Well, this is Danny.  Bottom line, I am not a problem and it was a one and done.  You won't have to see me ever there again.  To me, honestly, you don't sound like a problem.  You sound like somebody who just, eh, a little overzealous, which is not necessarily dangerous.  It's just you have to understand from the other side because you're just looking at like, hey, I'm a fan.  I'm glad I came by.  On the other side of it, like when you're quote-unquote in the public eye, even though the fan or the listener is well-intentioned, it can be a little scary just because all of a sudden there's someone at your door, even though your intentions are not bad. 
[02:06:00]  I'm sure, absolutely.  But the thing is, when that person, I mean, Anthony easily could have said to me, you know, I'm busy right now.  You know, he invited me into his home.  I was...  Into his home.  I was put in a bit of an awkward position right there.  And to tell you the truth, I was trying to get as much, you know, background on you as I could. 
[02:06:30]  Okay.  That, you know, and fine.  You know, we had a beer, nice conversation.  So when you...  No problem.  So when you invited me over, you didn't mean it either?  Uh, no, no.  I wanted to get all the info on Opie that I could possibly get.  Ant was taking...  I went over, Ant was taking cell phone pictures of me.  I'm like, why don't you fill these forms out, Anthony?  Yeah, really?  Release forms.  I'll just leave release forms in my mailbox.  Anthony's weird with all of us.  Yeah.  Why are you taking my drink cup away immediately after I'm done with this? 
[02:07:00]  Yeah.  Well, I'm...  So that's a fingerprint joke.  Okay.  I'm going to have to live my life more like the type of...  You know, person that I just kind of didn't want to, but I feel it necessary now that  I kind of have to.  That's how it is.  All right.  Are we cool?  We're cool.  Are we square?  I'm cool.  Are we square?  It's going to be the brunt of the show joke.  Fargo.  I mean, bottom line, I never would have rang the bell if you hadn't invited me to do so. 
[02:07:30]  All right.  So it's a one and done.  You can go back to your peaceful life.  All right.  Sounds fair enough, sir.  Good day, sir.  You take care now.  Yes.  That phone call ended just in time because...  He's walking down the hall with a big jug of water today.  Oh, Nicky.  Why the big jug of water?  Oh, Nicky.  All right.  Let's go back to the phone and say hi to Tom in Chicago. 
[02:08:00]  Tom.  Hey, this guy's a whack job.  Bottom line is, you know, everyone should be able to detect a cordial invite by a celebrity  as what it is.  Just being cordial, never to be meant to be taken up on.  Yeah, I say that to, you know, maybe I shouldn't say that to certain people.  I have no idea.  I say it to the police all the time.  They are cordially invited to my house and they pop in at all hours.  Well, they probably should be cordially invited.  They do pop in at all hours, which is fun.  Like, it's just like, that's exactly what I couldn't get my mind wrapped around. 
[02:08:30]  Like, if Kevin Smith is in here and we're talking and I'm like, oh, yeah, I'd love to  hang out.  And he'd be like, oh, yeah, drop by the store one day.  We'll chill.  That's exact.  Thank you.  I would never actually go and be like, hey, Kev, remember me?  You said I could come and hang out.  Let me tell you something.  Danny is exactly right.  One time, a little man named Quentin Tarantino was on our show.  That's right.  And he was like, you guys, if you're in L.A., yeah, I got the screening room and stuff.  You come by, watch a movie.  Let's fucking do that. 
[02:09:00]  And the thought.  I know what you're about to say, but you know what it is, Quentin Tarantino.  Let's fucking do that.  Of going to the Internet, finding out where Quentin Tarantino lives, dropping by his house and  saying, Quentin, remember you said that we could watch a movie at your, it just, it  goes without saying that.  It's kind of a.  Stop comparing yourself to Quentin Tarantino.  I'm fucking more brilliant than Quentin Tarantino, my friend.  Of course we got to go watch a movie with Quentin Tarantino.  What are you getting at?  Don't wreck my opportunity to watch a movie with Quentin Tarantino. 
[02:09:30]  Throne out on your head.  I have to remember when you said I got to point out the difference, though.  The difference is this is a daily radio show where it's like and I'm like, I'm playing  just like from the other point.  People kind of feel like they're hanging with us.  And when you're you're in someone's life, they're not.  No, no, no, no.  What I'm saying is you're in five hours a day.  They kind of get to know you.  It's a very interactive show.  Yeah.  Whereas Tarantino is a guy who comes in once and makes something.  But this is an interactive show thing.  I understand that that offer thing is just a little probably. 
[02:10:00]  Let's say hi to Brian.  Oh, is that Jesus?  Brian, look at that.  There you go.  Easy as pie, huh?  Brian.  Yeah.  Hey, Ant.  I was sitting there and I was in your show the night that that happened.  Yeah.  Everybody in the room.  I love you, Jeff, man.  But everybody in the room was telling you guys telling you that this guy was creepy  and giving everybody to do shows, but he was a stalker. 
[02:10:30]  And I remember you got there and said, yeah, music on.  Yeah.  Come on.  Bring the doorbell.  Everybody in the room was telling you this guy was a stalker because he just knew way too  much about you to just be, you know, a regular fan.  Yeah.  See, I'm still living my life.  Like I'm fucking a tin knocking idiot.  I'm going to have to fucking now.  What?  That's right.  Let's go to Dave in Levittown.  Dave.  Good evening.  Good evening. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, Dave.  I just want to make the note that Danny's over there, Mr. Protector of Anthony.  And wasn't he always showing up like you guys did, creepily in the background, in the  background of old pictures and whatnot?  Oh, yeah.  See, Danny was like that.  Only he got in the inner circle.  And Travis and E-Rock.  They were all creeps.  I got invited to an event at the Hard Rock that I showed up to.  I wasn't showing up at people's houses.  You weren't supposed to show up at that event.  I love the picture of Travis in the audience of the press conference. 
[02:11:30]  I know.  That's a great one.  When we were announcing we were on a series.  I was dropping off a resume to be an intern.  Danny's a rally.  I'm bringing that picture with me again.  Dan giving me his card from The Bone.  Right.  We just hired a hard rock, which I promptly threw away.  Our old intern, Ricky, was at that same event.  Yeah, yeah.  Good old Ricky.  We hired a bunch of fucking creeps.  How do you think I met Dice by fucking walking up to him at the store?  Hi, I'm a big fan of being a creep and hanging out. 
[02:12:00]  Ron the trucker.  Ron.  What's going on this morning, boys?  Hey, Ron.  What you need to do is just, hey, I'm going to have a bunch of helicopter buddies come over  and we'll just fly around the compound one evening and do a little night 3D flying.  Yeah, you got to do a little night flying.  A little helicopter night flying.  Nah, I got that heat shit.  I got security.  I got to get some cameras.  I got to get some nice helicopters up there, fire a couple of turbines, and just really buzz  the shit out of the neighbor's house.  Yeah, right on.  Let's go to Sean in Georgia. 
[02:12:30]  Here's the first.  Hold on a minute.  Here is the text thing that my sister got.  Here it is.  It says, call your brother and make sure he's okay.  I was by his house an hour and a half ago and all the lights and music are blasting and  no A.  Like, like, you, it seems to me you don't know me well enough to know that that's. 
[02:13:00]  It's a weird thing because it's not.  To have the music going in the backyard and the lights on and me not even be back there.  Maybe I'm downstairs for a minute.  All right.  I'm grabbing a beer.  Maybe I'm hanging with friends at the bar and then I'll come upstairs.  Like, to me, that was a little off.  All right.  Let's go to Sean in Georgia.  Sean.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  First of all, I was with the caller until he kept saying it was a one and done thing and  you can go back to your normal life. 
[02:13:30]  But, Anthony, if you're going to be advertising your place as a huge party where there's tons  of the young, naked girls running around and everything, you probably shouldn't be throwing  out sarcastic invitations.  Oh, it's.  And then people realize the truth.  The matter is, it's just me and Danny drinking a beer.  Two fucking fruits.  Anthony's got the only private residence with a hole drilled in a bathroom stall.  Jesus.  It's fucking him and Danny on either side pretending they don't know it's the other  guy.  And then neither one, after they both fill each other's mouths with goo, they never mention 
[02:14:00]  it when they're in the backyard drinking.  Just two men talking about chicks.  Rock on Long Island Rock.  How much of a carpenter charges to put in a glory hole?  They're so cheap when you do them yourself.  Anthony.  Yeah.  Listen, Monday morning when Opie says it's just him and E-Rock and the other idiots and  Anthony's not him, we don't want to find out that next week it's because he had  a confrontation with some exuberant fan who decided to triangulate.  All the stories you tell us about the little Italian restaurant near your house and the  gym.  I mean, everybody can kind of figure out what exit you hit the LIE and then backtrack 
[02:14:30]  and follow you.  I want to go to the compound and see the naked girls too.  But the problem is, it does not matter what this guy says, it's what you do.  And you really have to turn your entire brain around and be the big shot that you really  are.  No one should.  Impenetrable.  No one should fucking know based on what I talk about, where I live.  Jesus.  Oh, sorry.  Dave in Alberta.  Dave.  Yeah.  Hey.  Oh, am I?  This is it? 
[02:15:00]  Yeah.  No.  Hey, Anthony.  Yeah.  What's up, man?  Could I just ask you?  Hey, Jimmy.  Hey.  Sophie.  Yeah.  No, you really got to be careful about that stuff because, I mean, you turned my life  around, man.  There's a lot of people who really, really, I mean, I get up at 4 a.m. to listen to you  guys every day, man.  You changed my life.  You got to be careful about those people, man.  I don't want to have anybody come over here.  You sound like a nice guy.  Why don't you come by the house?  Sorry, I can't get across the border, unfortunately. 
[02:15:30]  But, yeah.  Oh, shit.  Why?  Oh, shit.  Why can't you cross the border, dude?  Yeah, murder rap.  Criminal record.  Whatever, man.  Yeah, whatever.  What'd you do?  He probably murdered a radio host.  He's a guy that shot fucking Boghossian's character.  You know, I said, good show, fucker.  You're a dead fucker.  You're a dead fucker.  Not quite, but, no, just answer him.  You got to be careful about that kind of thing.  I know.  A criminal's telling you that.  Yeah.  You're a big man.  Yeah.  This guy is probably just a fan.  He's a little, you know, again, we all get a little overzealous as fans sometimes. 
[02:16:00]  I've done it myself.  Exactly.  But you're lucky that it wasn't a bad situation.  Like, it could have been a really bad situation.  They're lucky.  They're fucking lucky.  Well, everyone's lucky.  I'm lucky.  Because, again, I have a mortgage to pay.  I don't need one of you guys getting fucking popped.  What if he showed up with a gun, man?  You never know.  You freaking, you never know, man.  What if he did?  Then it would have been a great fucking battle.  Would have been a great gun battle at my front door, motherfucker. 
[02:16:30]  Jesus Christ.  What's wrong with you?  I'm insane.  You are insane for real.  I'm kidding.  It's a character I play on the radio.  He's called Anthony Comey.  An odd character.  Let's go to Rich in Jersey.  Rich.  Hey, guys.  Morning.  Morning.  Opie, I seem to remember a story you told on the air that you were in Los Angeles and you happened to stop by Barry Williams' house for dinner at some point.  Well, it's, uh, Barry insisted, kind of like Quentin Tarantino, if you're ever in L.A., you know, stop on by and say hi. 
[02:17:00]  I didn't know where he lived.  And I called from, um, where did I call from?  Venice Beach.  And I'm like, what the fuck?  I'll give this a shot.  I'm going to be out here for a while.  And I called him up and he goes, fuck, you're in L.A.  I wish I had a better story where he could throw me under the bus.  But he goes, fuck, you're in L.A.  Come on over.  I'm like, are you sure?  I was even playing that game.  You're really sure?  He goes, yeah, come on over.  And, uh, then he gave me directions to his house at that point.  And then I did show up.  And it was awkward, like, maybe he was trying to just be nice because then he served me his leftovers. 
[02:17:30]  Leftovers?  Yeah.  They whipped together some leftovers.  And didn't you have, uh, all the Brady Bunch episodes on VHS?  Yeah, absolutely.  It was all on VHS.  Brady Bunch, uh, memorabilia all over the house.  You run out of the house, like, fucking leave a hole in the shape of your silhouette in the door.  It was surreal to be in his house, though, because he's like a fucking TV fucking icon.  But then he's, uh, I see him and his wife whispering over, uh, right around the, the, uh, refrigerator door trying to figure out what to serve me. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, no.  How embarrassing.  I wish I would have, you know, spoke up and said, why don't we go to dinner or why don't we get some fucking takeout?  It was some weird pea pasta dish that I hated.  Mind if I spend the night?  Because I'm a red sauce pasta guy, not that cream sauce shit.  Yeah.  But I wasn't going to say anything.  What are you going to say?  It's Greg Brady.  Yeah, he had that cream sauce.  Oh, by the way, he had the nice red sauce over some nice fresh pasta.  Oh, he did. 
[02:18:30]  Which made it even, which made it even weirder.  It was Jay.  Me and Jay stopped over there.  You brought a friend?  I was, I was hanging with Jay that day.  You told him me and my buddy are in town?  No, I said, I just told Jay, I'm going over there.  You want to come over?  I didn't even tell him fucking Barry.  Oh.  You're worse than this other guy.  Because I didn't want to go there alone.  Well, he probably wanted you to come alone.  That's funny.  I just didn't want to, though.  So I said, Jay.  And even Jay's like, you sure?  I'm like, yeah, fuck it. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Let's go over there.  It's Greg Brady.  We had martinis in the back.  His wife's whipping up the leftovers.  Wow.  Barry's agent was there.  That's funny.  One of the brothers that we all know.  Yeah, that's the story.  There's not much else to it, really.  Doesn't have to be.  That's pretty good right there.  But that was the only celebrity invite I ever took someone up on.  Wow.  We get him all the time.  But for the most part, you do feel like, ah, he didn't really mean it.  Never.  That's just it.  Although Kevin Smith offered us playoff tickets. 
[02:19:30]  And I absolutely took him up on that.  Because I'm a big hockey fan.  Kevin's different, though.  He's a friend, man.  You can tell that was sincere.  After the show, I'm like, if you mean this, I'm there.  You know that, because I'm a big hockey fan.  My team's way out of it.  He goes, no, I mean it.  I'm like, all right, cool.  Then I'm going.  Actually, he invited a bunch of us, and it was a good day.  You've hung with him for hours, though.  He's not a casual.  He's a guy that comes in for fucking hours.  You know what I mean?  He's a buddy.  It's different.  And that's it. 
[02:20:00]  That was the only celebrity house I ever was at.  Ever.  Oh, no.  I hung out with Dice once, too.  In his little apartment after his wife kicked him out.  Oh, you were never at the old place?  No.  The old place was nice.  I felt bad for him.  He had a tiny little apartment in Hollywood Hills.  He's like, no, it's good.  It's good.  And I knew it wasn't good.  He was just going through all that shit at the time.  We had a good day, though.  You want any more of these calls?  If they're good or interesting. 
[02:20:30]  Oh, let's say hi to Jamie in Buffalo.  I did pick up on this.  Jamie.  Hello.  Hey, Jamie.  Hey, Anthony, at the end of that call, he said, go back to your beautiful life.  That was the only part of that call that disturbed me.  He had that weird fucking creepy tone to his voice.  Well, that part, yeah, yeah.  It's like, go back to your normal life or something like that.  No, he said beautiful life.  Did he?  Yeah.  You just said, yeah, have a good day.  See, what, am I the asshole now?  Now am I the asshole? 
[02:21:00]  Because I'm fucking, you know.  Well, you're right.  I call out the situation as being a little creepy, and now I'm the fucking asshole.  I don't think you're an asshole, no.  So I think you're, I think you were a bit creeped out, and you want to express that.  Yeah.  That's all, Anthony.  Just watch your back.  You're not a tin knocker anymore, buddy.  When he was saying it's a one and done, I didn't take that as being confrontational.  I took that as being, like, I really was just going to stop by one time, and now people  think I'm going to stop by more, like, almost like, what the fuck?  It was one, one time.  Like, that's kind of how I, I didn't take that as being like, fuck you, one and done. 
[02:21:30]  I just don't like the constant, I know where you live.  And that, to me, is, eh.  I don't like hearing that, like, over and over.  And I've known for three years.  What?  I don't think I've lived there three years.  Whatever.  I don't know.  I text that I know where you live to you a lot, but that's just when I'm lonely and jerking off.  Tell me what window you're in. 
[02:22:00]  I sent Anthony a very weird text when I'm about to come.  Any of these others you want to, you know.  Um, nah.  All right, we're done.  All right, why don't we take a break?  We're going to regroup.  We got Sam.  He did What's the Haps at the Gay Pride Parade.  I want to hear this.  Sam probably the hit of the parade, by the way, with his twinkish little body.  Well, we'll find out.  We're going to find out next, but first we'll do a combo plotter where it's Sam.  We'll go backstage with Primetime.  And now, backstage with ONA, here is Primetime Sam Roberts. 
[02:22:30]  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and the interns of the Obi and Anthony show are at war.  Dennis, one of our new interns, sent a text to another intern and said that senior intern Paul talks to his coworkers as if they're shit and resembles Hitler in the way he works.  We got a copy of the texts and confronted Dennis to clear things up.  What do you think of Paul?  Paul?  She's a pretty serious guy, but, you know, he's a cool guy, though. 
[02:23:00]  Somebody told me that you thought that he reminded you of Hitler.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I believe he said that Paul is going to be Hitler-ing around tomorrow.  Which is probably, it sounds like something I would say.  You said, I hate how Paul talks to people.  Well, like, you got me.  I do.  He just talks down to people like he's better than them?  I guess.  He's just an intern.  I know, but he is the senior intern. 
[02:23:30]  What's that?  I mean, what's a...  A glorified intern.  Do you think this place would probably be more pleasant for the interns if maybe Paul wasn't around so often?  I don't know, because we have the whole, like, agreement with Sirius that we can't talk to other females and stuff, so I guess, like, you know...  What does the females have to do with it?  You know, Paul might, you know, scare them away with his pirate vibes.  With barbs like that being thrown, we had to find Paul, the ugly, glorified intern, to find out how he would react to Dennis' remarks. 
[02:24:00]  Paul, you know intern Dennis?  No.  Well, this new intern, he compared you to Hitler in some text messages that he sent.  Oh, I'm aware of the text messages, yes.  He says he hates how you talk to people and you look down on fellow interns as if they're shit.  Well, if he proves he's not shit, maybe I'll look at him in a better light.  He called you a pirate and a mountain man and said that you spend your time here Hitler-ing around.  Will you stop Hitler-ing? 
[02:24:30]  Yeah, as soon as he shows he can fucking work on his own.  Do you think you're better than he is?  No, what the boy doesn't understand is that respect is earned, not given.  Has Dennis earned your respect?  No, I've never seen him do a goddamn thing.  But none of the interns really do anything.  Some of them do.  Does he do the least?  Couldn't even tell you.  Could you tell me that the other interns do something?  Oh yeah, definitely.  So?  So yeah, he definitely does the least.  Who's in the right?  Is Paul an unattractive dictator? 
[02:25:00]  Is Dennis a lazy nobody?  But yes, we'll stay with this story as it continues to develop.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and this has been...  Backstage with ONA.  That's right.  Thank you, Mr. Fallon.  Thank you.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show?  Jerry?  Sam's in studio.  Sam.  Did the right thing?  You went out there and tried to, you know, talk to the peeps? 
[02:25:30]  Always.  Try to get some material for the radio show?  I like meeting new people and finding out what's going on.  And it brought you to the gay pride parade there, Sam.  Well, that's what happened to be going on this weekend, so that's where I happened to be.  Did you sample any of the goods while you were down there?  What do you mean, like foods or...?  Well, sure, if you want to call it food.  Try the cock.  No, I didn't try any penis or anything like that.  No.  How do they serve penis?  Wonderful. 
[02:26:00]  Tiny little shorts, apparently.  A lot of tiny little shorts.  Yes.  See, we were talking about this about an hour ago.  Comes in a bun.  Maybe we could get some of the gay guys to call, because I imagine that the tiny little...  Yes.  The tiny little shorts is not helping the cause.  As they're trying to get marriage legal in a lot of states, you know, the tiny little  shorts might be throwing a lot of people off to the cause.  A lot of gay people are upset.  They think Bruno is playing too heavily on stereotypes, you know. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah, that's coming out a lot.  Right.  But the gay community still allows these crazy parades where...  Pride parade looks like something that, like, Bruno would fit in there and wouldn't look  like out of place or wacky.  You wouldn't even notice him.  You wouldn't even know which one's Bruno.  He'd be conservative.  I hear he's in the parade somewhere.  Yeah.  You spend half the day trying to figure out which one's Bruno.  Nobody minds their stereotypes in a parade.  That's celebrating their diversity.  But if you're making fun of the stereotype, that's inappropriate.  That's, yeah.  But the only time, like, the whole gay thing comes to our attention is when you see the 
[02:27:00]  fucking parade footage.  Right?  Yeah, because there's...  So then if you're in that community, wouldn't you be like, let's...  We gotta fucking calm this thing down.  This is our only chance where we do get people paying attention to us.  It's the identity that they build.  Stupid!  When they're fighting for political causes, they don't set up an identity.  They're not a smart group.  And then when they do set up their identity, it's like, you know, men with angel wings and  underpants on.  Right.  Angel wings.  Oh, God, that's great. 
[02:27:30]  You can't have angel wings and underpants on when you're trying to, like, be respected.  They're fighting for their rights, but they are dressed like Cupid.  We just want to fit in like everyone else.  You know something?  Yeah, Cupid's trying to tell us what he thinks about, you know, gay marriage.  And we're not even paying attention.  You look like an idiot right now.  They're wearing no pants.  Right.  Yeah.  You saw some Cupid's down there?  There were Cupid's.  There were men, like, with no pants.  Like, just no pants. 
[02:28:00]  Well, I mean, pants...  Well, like, they had little briefs on and underpants.  Like, some guys had these, uh...  I guess they would be considered miniskirts sort of things with no shirts, but they came  up above the butt cheek.  Oh, so their butt was hanging out.  And then they were wearing...  No, they were wearing underwear, but it was, like, almost thongish, so the bottom of the  cheeks were quite visible.  They hang out.  A lot of gay guys at these parades love the bottom of their butt cheeks hanging out.  Is that the new look?  Is that the new look? 
[02:28:30]  Yeah, you leave the bottom of the butt cheeks.  The high-riding underpants.  What do they call that style?  I'm not sure.  I guess I should have asked.  You need that bit of ass meat hanging out of the bottom.  That's like cleavage for gay guys.  The cheeks hanging out.  Yeah, that's cleavage.  For real?  No, I'm just guessing.  It looks like two tits.  It would have to be, yeah.  Yeah, you could put your dick between them.  There's a lot of packages on display in the underpants, too.  It was very, uh, nerve-wracking. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah?  Yeah, what do you mean?  Yeah, nerve-wracking.  We were sweating a little bit.  It was uncomfortable.  Yes, this is a picture that Danny has brought up is a perfect example of something you might  see.  A lot of gay dogs, too.  What's a gay dog?  The gays, they bring their gay dogs.  But you could tell their, the dogs are gay, too?  Wow, dude.  How can you tell a dog is gay?  It's raised to be gay.  But do they look a certain way?  They got scarves on and stuff.  Oh, fuck.  The fucking dog is like, no!  I wish dogs could talk because they're like, look, what you do is whatever. 
[02:29:30]  As long as you feed me, but don't fucking bring me into your world with the gay scarves  and stuff.  Dogs are marching in the parade with scarves on.  They don't even want to.  Oh, no.  That is hilarious.  The other dogs are looking, going, oh.  Yeah.  Oh, your owner's gay, obviously.  Yeah.  What do they dress you in?  Really?  Hell yeah.  Oh, my God.  What's the type of thing?  That guy's pants.  They are pulled down to where they're resting on his dick.  That is right at the top of his dick. 
[02:30:00]  There appears to be 8 to 12 inches between his waistline and his belly button.  Yeah.  Which doesn't normally occur.  Of tattooed real estate, by the way, also.  Pierced nipples.  He's flexing and making a muscle as he is making out with another six-packed gentleman.  Great shape, though.  Well, you know, the gays, they have to stay in shape.  They were in good shape down there?  They have to.  Oh, yeah.  Unless you're a bear.  You see a lot of bears down there?  No, no, no.  It was more the young, shapely men. 
[02:30:30]  Right, right.  There's a couple of biker guys.  Shirts, very optional.  Yeah, oh, very few shirts.  I don't see many shirts.  I felt like a dork wearing a shirt.  Look, there's guys, maybe they're going to go swimming.  They're wearing their underwear and nothing else.  They're on the way to the beach.  Yeah.  Maybe it's a triathlon.  I don't know.  Sometimes you're not sure if it's a gay pride parade or a triathlon coming by.  You don't know.  Why don't they put out a workout tape just called Gay Abs? 
[02:31:00]  Yeah.  Because they all have abs.  It's amazing.  Let's say hi to Ben.  Abs.  Ben, you're gay.  Yeah.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hi, Ben.  All right, Ben, you're gay.  Okay, so we're trying to figure this shit out.  Like, if you guys are trying to get some real stuff done out there in the world, I can't imagine these parades make you happy.  No.  You know what?  And I'm one of those rare type.  I don't, I'm like, I don't kind of like wear it like they do.  I don't, I don't dress up. 
[02:31:30]  I don't, uh.  You don't let your freak flag fly?  No, no.  But you see, personally, I have opposed, I have friends, and I argue at this point to them all the time.  And I tell them, I said, you know, the more you be radical, the more you turn people against us.  But they, they, they, they, they can't seem to get it.  They just, they don't get it.  It's like, you have to attack.  They have to say, okay, no, no, no, they have to accept us.  There's other ways to do it.  And they just, it's, it's a matter of, it's a matter of education, really. 
[02:32:00]  I don't know.  It's going to be tough.  You know, it's going to be tough to turn people around anyway.  But it doesn't help matters when you're seeing the, the flamboying stuff out there.  That's what pride always accomplishes.  It, like, gets all the people who already support it to rally behind it.  But none of the people who don't support it turn around.  So it doesn't really accomplish anything.  No, you, you're, you're right.  And, I mean, and as much as I love, you know, twinks dressing up in women's clothing, um, you know, to go out in public, uh, you know, go shopping and stuff like that, just to, to, to what point and purpose? 
[02:32:30]  To annoy other people?  I mean, look at this guy.  I don't mean to interrupt you, Ben, but we're looking at angel wings with the, uh, with the gay colors, the rainbow colors.  It's just like, come on.  There's also, there's a huge population of guys who dress up, like, as, uh, iconic superheroes, except shiny.  Like, a lot of shiny Robins.  Oh, really?  Yeah, and, like, Batman, except without the full, uh, Batman costume, like, just the underwear. 
[02:33:00]  It's not gay enough.  Just the underwear and belt and cape and mask.  But how is he going to protect himself?  How is the gay Batman going to protect himself?  I know, he doesn't have the rubber.  With all that skin expense.  Okay.  I didn't see that.  There's no reason for that.  It's Batman and Robin.  Without their pants on.  Without their pants and, like, with, with crotchless chaps.  But they have everything else on from the costume.  That's exactly, that's how the real Batman and Robin should have dressed.  That's exactly how they should be dressed.  All right, Ben.  Thank you for your, uh, your phone call there. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah.  Let me go to Stryker, because he's got a very good question for Sam.  Stryker.  Good morning, boys.  Hey, hey.  You know, listening to Sam's description of the way these guys are dressed, and the description  you guys are giving of the way the pictures that Danny's pulling up are dressed, are you  sure that he was at the gay pride parade and not at a WWE event?  All right.  It's very similar, Sam.  It's not similar.  It's very similar.  The top, first of all, there's a ton of this going on at WWE event. 
[02:34:00]  Would Batman really be blowing Robin?  Wouldn't Robin be blowing Batman?  That is just, uh, that's pornography is what that is.  Yeah, why?  Why would Batman be blowing Robin?  And jerking himself off.  He's enjoying himself.  Are these outtakes from, uh, The Dark Knight?  Adam West complained because he wasn't asked to be in this photo shoot.  It doesn't matter what it is.  If it's Batman, he's pissed.  Jesus Christ.  It's not me.  But no, there's nothing even...  It wasn't a WWE event?  It didn't even somewhat resemble a WWE event. 
[02:34:30]  No, not at all.  It didn't.  Was the ass man the, uh...  Down, down.  Well, the ass man might have fit in a tiny bit.  A little bit.  Oh, it's going to get stuck in my head again.  Ass man!  Yes, I...  If the ass man had a float and this song was pumping, he probably would be a hit at the gay pride break.  This song would fit, like, they should have been playing this.  Yes, yes, that is true.  Because listen to what they're doing with the ass.  Kick...  I love to shove him.  Shove him.  I love to stick him. 
[02:35:00]  Stick him.  Go to that thing.  Oh.  I love to watch him.  Watch him.  I love to pick him.  Pick him.  Yeah.  I'm going to kick him.  Y'all.  There's no violence.  Because he's an ass man.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Who doesn't love the ass man song?  Yeah.  I've been singing it all week.  Now he's wrestling in front of 600 people in Jersey City.  Poor ass man.  You saw him, huh?  I got to do play-by-play for one of his matches.  That's where he's at in his career.  Oh, Sam's doing it. 
[02:35:30]  Play-by-play.  Play-by-play.  Oh.  I bet.  I want to hear some...  What's the haps at the gay pride parade with Sam?  Some of these guys...  Now, Sam, you must have...  Were you getting looks?  I don't...  Because you are about a sweet little cupcake.  I appreciate the compliment.  Ooh.  But I go with my journalistic hat on, so I really have tunnel vision.  But your pants off, right?  No, my pants...  Your pants weren't off?  My pants and belt were both on.  But you were still official because you had the microphone. 
[02:36:00]  I had a microphone.  You had the hat that said press on the side, right?  Yes.  I have tunnel vision.  I do not pay attention.  If there are any men looking at me sexually, I don't know.  It's not something that I concentrate on.  When they start kissing you...  I don't get kissed.  You should know then that they're looking at you sexually.  I don't get kissed at these events.  No?  No.  You kiss other men at other events that aren't even gay.  No, I do not.  Well, I have, but I do not as a...  I don't as a practice.  There's a homeless guy.  There was Bob Kelly.  There was some other guy. 
[02:36:30]  Sam's like a fucking four at the gay pride parade.  He's not exactly a sought-after twink.  He's a very average gay guy.  Very average.  No, but you like just his thinness.  Average producer, too.  Well, no.  I don't know.  Above average, I thought.  Oh, well.  I mean, I guess you know better than me.  And then his hair is very original.  What?  Gay people would be like, ooh.  They think he's messy.  I like to jizz in that.  He's got fucking stupid feet point out.  He's got no hips.  I don't have hips.  Sam's a four at the gay pride parade.  Wow.  Very flat ass.  Yeah, flat ass and hipless. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah.  Nice neck.  Sam has a nice, long swan neck.  Thank you, Jim.  Yeah, Sam's neck is his sexiest feature.  All the better to pump jizz down.  Okay, well, hopefully not.  I want to kiss more guys.  Really?  That's not live content.  That is pre-taped material.  Chuck G. from Charlotte writes,  I worked as an electrician on Cape Cod several years back  and have done some work in Provincetown  and have found that every summer  there's one gentleman that would ride his bike down Commercial Street  and nothing but a pair of black angel wings. 
[02:37:30]  And then he writes dot, dot, dot, ick.  What is with the angel wings?  Angel wings are just such a festive piece.  As far as the Bible's concerned,  it's the only way they'll ever have them.  There was a group with signs that said,  you know, can we go to hell?  Oh, I didn't even get that.  Because of the Catholic Church.  Hey, was Bobo there fighting for the right to fuck his brother?  No, Bobo was actually, I've heard,  there is a rumor he was having sex with his brother  and didn't make it to Pride.  Oh, Pride. 
[02:38:00]  You just call it Pride.  Pride, that's what it is.  Oh, right.  We told Bobo.  You say happy Pride.  I didn't know that.  Bobo needs a new bit.  We told him that Bobo Springsteen is officially dead.  He Twittered it, by the way.  He said that his bit is officially dead.  Good, good.  But he said,  I have a bunch of new material I'm coming up with.  I can't wait to hear his new material.  You know he's rehearsing.  I actually heard that he records himself  having sex with his brother  and just brings in the audio.  Oh, I can't wait to hear that.  It happens a lot, so. 
[02:38:30]  All right, whatever.  Here we go.  Sam starts with Daniel, right?  Yeah, Daniel just had a,  he just kept laughing.  Daniel.  I just thought his giggle was infectious.  All right, we're here with Daniel  at the gay pride parade.  Daniel, what's the haps?  Nothing much.  What are you doing here today?  I'm just looking around,  you know, looking at everything.  Just having fun.  How is the gay community  dealing with the loss  of infomercial king Billy Mays? 
[02:39:00]  I don't really know who that is.  He's the guy,  he's on Pitchman  and he yells at the TV.  He's on all the infomercials.  He's got a beard.  Is he the one from like the ShamWow or something?  No, but he's like that guy.  Oh, I don't know who that is.  He's dead.  Oh, he died?  Yeah.  That's sad.  I don't really know who that is, though.  Well, you sound pretty broken up.  Thanks a lot.  I'm sorry.  Is the parade backing up into his ass  every time you ask him a question?  Holy shit.  That could possibly be 
[02:39:30]  the gayest voice I've ever heard in my life.  He had a, this kid,  he was fully dressed,  but he was wearing shorts and a t-shirt.  I know.  He had shorts and a t-shirt on  and had rainbow socks  pulled all the way up,  so it almost looked like leggings.  That's cute.  The rainbow is a symbol for pride.  I don't know if you guys knew that.  Yeah, we know that.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Right.  How annoyed is Jesse Jackson  that he fucking calls this thing 
[02:40:00]  the Rainbow Coalition?  Rainbow Coalition.  Two hours later,  the gays take the same thing.  We meet Benjamin.  Oh, yeah.  Benjamin was selling Obama condoms.  Really?  He was standing on the corner  with a box  and yelling out Obama condoms.  What are Obama condoms like?  What's the difference  between that and a regular condom?  When you fuck somebody  and you pull your dick out  and a lot of your hard-earned money  is stuck to it.  Well, he was having no luck selling  because people kept walking up  because people would give things out at Pride.  And people kept walking up 
[02:40:30]  and saying,  oh, cool.  And every time they'd pick one up,  he'd say,  no, it's three for ten.  And then they'd put it back down.  But I wanted to find out  what an Obama condom was.  So some of his puns,  I think since this is a comedy show,  you guys will all just kind of  really kind of like.  I love that, Sam.  Hey, Sam,  who'd you go down there with?  My girlfriend,  Jess,  who's a girl.  We're out here  at the Gay Pride Parade  with Benjamin.  Benjamin, what's the haps?  The what?  The haps? 
[02:41:00]  The haps.  Well, we're selling  Obama condoms  for everybody's hard times.  They're actually curved to the left  and flavored with...  Oh, my God.  Here come the puns.  Hard times.  Curved to the left.  Right?  Here come the puns.  And flavored with...  What do you think?  Chocolate?  No.  I would think  because he's, you know,  an African-American gentleman.  Oh, wow.  Flavored with...  Can you ring the bell  for every pun?  Oh, please.  There's got to be something  with package and stimulus.  Yes, yes.  Oh, yeah.  You guys heard this clip before? 
[02:41:30]  Stimulus.  Very good.  Down the throat  to the American people?  No.  No, he's a supporter of Obama.  What do you think  it's flavored with?  Yeah, that's the thing.  Maybe it's not  a traditional flavor.  Maybe it's just  that's how wacky  and fun it is.  Oh, oh.  Does it sound  kind of like a flavor?  Maybe not even.  It's just so, like,  crazy and wacky  that it's like,  how could...  That's not even  a real flavor.  Flavored with shit?  Yes.  Flavored with change?  You're getting close.  I know.  Ew! 
[02:42:00]  I know it has something  to do a change.  Flavored with...  What's the other tag word?  Change and...  Yes, we can.  It was flavored  in someone's can.  Change and what?  I don't know.  Well, I mean...  Fuck, I don't feel like  playing fucking password  right now.  I don't give me  a fucking answer.  We could just listen  to the clip.  Oh, my God.  No, it's not flavored  with...  Flavored with...  That's what some  people are writing.  It's not even...  That's not even a flavor.  It doesn't even make sense.  Let's find out.  That's crazy.  And we'll ring the bell 
[02:42:30]  every time there's a pun.  We're out here  at the Gay Pride Parade  with Benjamin.  Benjamin, what's the haps?  The what?  The haps?  The haps.  Well, we're selling  Obama condoms  for everybody's hard times.  They're actually curved  to the left  and flavored with hope.  Is Obama curved  to the left  or is that just  like a joke  about his...  Well, no.  The condoms are actually  curved to the left  in scientific studies.  They tend to go  to the left  more to the right.  Lately, we've found  that they've been  moving towards center.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, I get it  because of his policies.  Oh, you're catching on there. 
[02:43:00]  Yes.  Do you think this is  something Obama  would be proud of?  Oh, definitely.  He's a fan of entrepreneurship.  He's a fan of safety.  He's a fan of hope.  He's a fan of judgment  and, most importantly,  the stimulus package.  Oh, the stimulus  because of the...  Like boners.  There you go.  Obama condoms.  He got tired of me.  What makes an Obama condom  different from  like a regular condom?  They're actually  hope flavored  and lubed with hope as well.  What does hope taste like? 
[02:43:30]  Surprisingly like latex.  Oh, I see.  Well, best of luck to you.  Thank you, brother.  He got really sick of me.  That's why I started  trying to sell the condoms.  He's just turning around.  You're fucking,  you know,  you're fucking his business.  That music will give you  a fucking headache.  Oh, it was all over.  It was not escapable.  Just pounding.  Boom, boom, boom.  Couldn't be on Fifth Avenue  without some nice...  Boom, boom, boom, boom.  I want you in my room.  I wish this song was quite...  At least the boom  in this song is softer. 
[02:44:00]  You know what I mean?  Boom, boom, boom.  Let's think...  All right, let's...  Oh, you meet Anthony  at the gate, right?  Yeah, Anthony is there.  Oh, Anthony.  Now, Sam, I said  this was off the record.  Oh, no.  Who is the party, he says.  We meet Anthony,  who is the party  and represents gay people well.  Yes.  All right, we're here  with Anthony  at the Gay Pride Parade.  Anthony, what's the haps?  Well, right now,  I'm very upset  because they refuse  to play Kelly Clarkson.  I do not hook up.  But, you know,  everything else is good. 
[02:44:30]  But I'm enjoying myself.  This is my first time  going to Pride here in New York.  So, right now,  it's kind of fun.  I'm the party right now.  You are the party?  Yes, I'm the party.  Cool.  Yes.  How do you feel?  There's a lot of controversy  with Sacha Baron Cohen's  new movie, Bruno,  about it playing  on stereotypes and stuff.  Do you think there's problems  with the way people view gays  as, like, an oversexed...  Yes.  Yes.  In a way, there it is.  Where do you think  that people get those ideas from? 
[02:45:00]  From certain movies  that they show on television.  In a way,  they don't show exactly  what gays go through.  They just...  They make it seem like  we're all about the nightlife,  doing drugs and everything.  That's not what it's really about.  Do you think the Pride Parade  with the men  dancing around  in their underwear  and stuff on the floats  and partying  adds or detracts from that?  Well,  it's a gay Pride Parade.  Like, you're supposed to, like,  go all out and have fun  because it's only one day 
[02:45:30]  out of the year  where you actually  get to be yourself.  That's what gay guys do, right?  Exactly.  There you go.  You just made him  turn the whole thing around.  I love it.  That's what gay guys do.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Oh, wait a minute.  I just said,  no,  we don't do that.  Jesus.  Oh, boy.  He was the party, though.  You can twist people around.  Well, I mean, it's, you know...  You were just playing him.  Of course I was.  Oh, God.  Like this guy.  He's in a pink little skirt.  You're telling me  that guy's not an idiot?  With a pink flower 
[02:46:00]  laying in the street.  Sneakers.  Sneakers on and...  Some type of...  Jesus.  ...tutu or...  Can't imagine.  Wow.  Anthony continues.  Talks about losing Billy Mays.  Well, because I just...  While I was at Pride,  it was on Sunday,  so I just had gotten an email  that Billy Mays had passed away.  How many career homers  did he end up with?  No, that's not the same guy.  Oh, wow.  Billy Mays is the infomercial guy.  God, I can't get this right today.  How is the gay community 
[02:46:30]  dealing with the loss  of infomercial king Billy Mays?  Ooh.  All right.  Honestly, I'm not sure.  He's the guy from the infomercials.  He has the beard  and he yells a lot.  OxiClean.  Oh, him.  Yeah.  He's dead.  What about him?  He's dead.  Oh, I don't know about that.  I didn't know he died.  Yeah, that's why I was trying to see  how people are reacting.  He died just today.  Oh, my God. 
[02:47:00]  I did not know that at all.  Were you a fan?  I liked the commercial.  Honestly, I thought it was funny  because he made it seem like  it was the cure for everything.  Yeah.  So, I liked it.  It seemed very good to me.  Had your hopes up, didn't you?  All right, well, great.  Thanks a lot.  You're welcome.  You're welcome.  Him and his friend  just fucking guzzling  fucking oxy...  Whatever it's called.  OxyClean.  OxyClean.  Hi, I'm Billy Maids. 
[02:47:30]  Oh, hello.  Hello.  Hello.  We meet Eric, who...  Oh, Iraq was there, too.  Yes.  Who's wearing underpants  and rollerblades.  Eric was great  because he was...  Yes, he was one of...  He was very muscular,  very in good shape,  clean cut,  and just underpants on,  just green and orange underpants  and rollerblades.  It doesn't seem very safe,  like you could maybe  scuff a knee or something.  Where the fuck  does he keep his money there, Sam? 
[02:48:00]  Yeah, in case he needs a drink  or a little lunch or something.  I bet it stinks  when he pays for it.  Yes.  Let me grab into my wallet.  It's one of those  old cigar holders,  plastic.  Jesus.  Puts it in there  and pounds it in with a mallet.  All right,  I'm ready for a day  of rollerblading.  Got to give the guy  a Heinleck if you want change.  Ugh.  Creepy.  So where does he  keep his money, Sam?  He was holding his cell phone  so his money must be kept 
[02:48:30]  inside the underpants.  There must be some kind  of pocket.  They were very tight  so I wouldn't assume  that anything would slip out.  All right,  we're out here with Eric  at the Gay Pride Parade.  Eric, what's the haps?  I'm with Naked Boys Singing.  So is this why today  you're in the underwear  and rollerblades?  Yes,  our signature colors  are lime green  and sherbet orange  and I'm rollerblading  because it's nice  to be able to zip  back and forth  and say hi  to all my friends  and I can be  my own personal float. 
[02:49:00]  Do you think  one of the problems  politically  with the way people  are dealing with gays  in the media  and other places  is the stereotypes  that they have  about gays being  oversexed  and things like that?  Yeah, I think  they do that a lot.  You know,  any coverage  of the parades  they always show  the most outlandish  person or float  in the parade  which is a demographic  of the community  but it doesn't represent  the community as a whole.  Would you put yourself  in that outlandish category?  Oh, I think I kind of like  the best of both worlds. 
[02:49:30]  I can be fun  and outlandish  but I can also  sort of reel it in  and be a professional.  So in your day-to-day life  you do wear pants?  I do wear pants.  I do.  Good question though.  But he said  like if it's such a problem  that people are  concentrating too much  on the outlandish people  put your pants on.  Put your pants on.  Really?  Put your pants on.  You could wear a tank top.  Right, right.  It's not that warm.  Yeah, yeah, come on.  Put your pants on  and get some things done  and then go back  to wearing the underpants.  Right.  If you want to skate around  in your underpants at home  that's one thing.  That is something 
[02:50:00]  that they just say like  yeah, oh, that is true.  Yeah, it's a problem.  Yeah, it's a problem.  As he's naked.  He continues.  How is the gay community  reacting to the loss  of infomercial king  Billy Mays?  Of what?  Of the loss  of infomercial king  Billy Mays.  He passed away.  Okay, who is he  first of all?  He, uh, he's the guy  from the infomercials.  He had the...  Whambo?  Maybe Whambo.  He had the oxyclean.  He had the beard.  The bearded?  Yeah.  Oh, I'm so sad.  I didn't know he was gay  just because I'm like... 
[02:50:30]  He's not gay.  You know, you never know  who's gay and who's not  sometimes.  I didn't know he was gay  either.  That makes me sad.  I just found out  that from you.  But, um,  it makes me sad  when anyone passes away.  But, you know,  life ebbs and flows.  You know what I mean?  People come and people go  and...  Hopefully the soul  of Billy Mays  is now being put  into a newborn.  Whambo.  I know.  Didn't he say like,  Whambo?  I know he just screamed  a lot.  He got his point  across, though.  He did.  Why is that funny? 
[02:51:00]  He did.  He did.  I don't know.  For some reason  it just tickled me  that he said,  oh, I didn't know  he was gay.  Yeah.  Nobody said he was.  Did his ball bag  jiggle when he laughed  like that?  I didn't look at the ball bag.  I make eye contact.  What kind of  fucking reporter are you?  Did Billy Mays  say Whambo?  I don't know.  He said like...  Kaboom.  Kaboom.  Yeah, he was  the Kaboom guy.  There's no Whambo.  It's very generic  to say Whambo.  Wait, didn't Billy Mays  say you're no son of mine 
[02:51:30]  get the fuck out  of my house?  No, that must have  been someone else.  I think he said  booyah.  But there will be  a video of this  posted later this week.  Oh, we can't wait.  So you guys can see  Eric in his underpants  in all his glory.  And when I was  looking at the video  that I had my girlfriend  Jess who accompanied  me to the parade  take, she...  Girlfriend?  Girlfriend.  Right.  She did a kind of  like a wide shot  so Eric's package  was in frame  throughout the interview. 
[02:52:00]  Oh, good.  Yes.  Did she enjoy  the packages?  I think not.  Why wouldn't she?  Because they're all...  They're very gay.  They're gay packages.  How would that work  with a girl for real?  They're still men.  It doesn't matter.  But they're not manly.  Does the girl enjoy  the gay package?  Like just, you know,  watching it and admiring it.  Here it is.  Girls would admire  the shape  that these guys  are in.  Yeah.  Regardless of their  sexual orientation.  It would be like  having a chick  that is really hot  but is a lesbian. 
[02:52:30]  A guy would enjoy  looking at her.  But Jess doesn't  really like guys  that are in shape  like that.  She doesn't like guys?  No, that are in shape  like that I said.  She prefers like skinny  like...  Oh really?  Yeah.  I like the fact  that Jake LaMotta  here just pointed out  that they weren't...  They're not very masculine.  Well, I...  No.  I remember  we were talking  about Obama.  This is a quickie  before the break.  Obama, thank you, Sam.  That was really good.  You're welcome.  You did all right.  Yes.  Thank you.  I know it was 
[02:53:00]  a tough assignment for you.  It was.  Why are you saying  that sarcastically  as if I enjoyed it?  It's going to be hard  to report  with a raging hard-on.  First of all,  I didn't have a hard-on.  He had to actually  fucking rubberband  his dick to the  fucking thigh  so it wouldn't  seem unprofessional.  That's true,  but I don't...  Danny just  looked up the word  twinks in Google images.  Well, you told Danny  to show a while.  Look at those two  just taking a bath together.  It's not a worry  in the world.  Sucking each other's dicks. 
[02:53:30]  They're not  worried about  a Ponzi scheme.  No.  Don't give a shit.  Here's Obama  a quickie from Obama.  He was talking  and some shit happened.  For we know  that progress  depends not only  on changing laws  but also  changing hearts.  Yes.  And that real  transformative change  never begins  in Washington.  Who's...  Who's...  Who's ducked back there? 
[02:54:00]  It's a duck.  There's a duck  quacking in there  somewhere.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Where do you guys  get these ringtones  by the end?  I'm just curious.  Why do I know that?  Indeed,  that's the story  of the movement  for fairness and equality.  Wow.  He goes right back  to it too quickly.  Then he goes right back to it.  He's got a laugh.  I was enjoying  the dumb little moment 
[02:54:30]  but then he couldn't  let it just play out.  He's got a laugh.  He is kind of  naturally funny  when it comes to  things like that.  He's pretty good  when he's giving  a speech  if something happens  unless it's serious.  Some kind of serious thing.  Him trying to think  on his feet.  But for a good goof,  he's pretty funny.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Is Sean William Scott  coming in today?  For real?  Yeah, he's supposed  to be coming in.  20 minutes.  Fucking A.  Did you see him on set  yesterday, Jimmy? 
[02:55:00]  He's in that movie too.  He's got a big part  in the movie  and a fucking  really funny part.  I think Kevin Smith  has a hit on his hands.  You've got Bruce.  You've got Tracy.  You've got Sean William Scott.  You've got Adrian Brody.  Kevin Pollack  played two cops.  Jim Norton.  Old Jimmy Norton.  Yeah, who knows?  You know, somebody  in the room  may make it  into the trailer.  We just don't know yet.  Is that what they say?  I don't know.  Just a line  that the guys  might have had.  Who knows?  I don't know.  The big catchphrase line 
[02:55:30]  or something?  You know how many people  see trailers, Jimmy?  I mean,  holy fuck.  Boo!  That would be huge.  Well, I don't even know.  They'd probably  just show those two.  I hate tags.  Anyone have a fucking thing  that could cut  this goddamn tag off?  That'd be so funny  if it's just the top  of your sweaty head  with Bruce Willis'  hand on it.  And Bruce Willis.  Jimmy's saying  he had a line  that might just...  Well, it was actually  them saying it.  But do you know  how embarrassed  I was when he  fucking wanted to  ask me to dry  my fucking forehead?  Dry your fucking  sweaty head? 
[02:56:00]  Sorry, there's an icon  slipping off my  greasy, nervous head.  Fucking asshole.  My fucking head  was all greasy  and nervous.  That's funny.  I'm acting!  It's so goddamn funny.  All right.  So he's coming in,  what, 10?  Yes.  Well, we're leaving  at 10.05,  so it's a quick  fucking quick interview.  All right.  Maybe we'll trade  Bruce stories.  Ooh.  A couple of co-stars  trading Bruce stories. 
[02:56:30]  Why not?  All right, we'll continue.  Jimmy.  O.B. and Anthony.  Sam's got to come  back in here.  We were done with him,  but he just gave us  some knowledge.  One more fun.  Sam, we've got to  talk about this  on the air.  What the hell  has been going on  for the last three  hours down the hall?  Well, we all remember  on the show  when Anthony said  to go with his  green flag and red flag  he needed a yellow flag,  right?  Everybody remembers  that, right?  Here's what I actually 
[02:57:00]  said.  We have a paddle.  On one side is green.  On the other side  is red.  That's a bad green,  by the way,  on the paddle.  Yeah, well,  it's kind of faded.  Now it's like a  brownish olive thing.  Yeah.  But I think we know.  Green, red.  But it's just flat,  like a paddle.  Iraq is coming down  the hall,  which means he wants in.  Oh, he wants in.  He's smiling.  He's smiling away.  I love Iraq.  I was thinking.  He gets a lot.  Hold on.  He gets a lot of abuse,  but I love this part  of Iraq.  Oh, yeah.  This is great.  I can't wait to get involved. 
[02:57:30]  Go ahead, Ed.  Sorry.  See, now I was thinking  a three-sided paddle.  Yeah.  Which is, you know,  you open up this  and then you add in  another yellow panel,  thus making a triangle.  Right.  And then fasten  the handle to the triangle.  That way I could  turn one handle  yellow, green, red,  depending on what's being said.  It was of the utmost importance  needed to get done ASAP.  Correct?  No.  Actually, I forgot about it 
[02:58:00]  seconds after I said it.  Never expected the yellow.  I think if I just say,  oh, yellow flag,  I think that's good.  And this is radio.  Oh, right.  It was an afterthought.  It really was an afterthought.  Like, yeah,  that would be kind of funny  if we had a yellow side too,  but whatever.  That's stupid.  Though I do hold up  the paddle.  It is indeed radio,  so I could say yellow.  So what happened, Sam?  Unfortunately,  one member of our staff  heard you say yellow flag  and then shut down 
[02:58:30]  everything else.  E-Rock is nodding.  Everything has been shut down.  Steve is back to work today.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Steve is, well,  Steve is here  in the building today.  All right.  Oh, so we were off  by that sick day  by one day  because we were convinced  he was setting up  for the sick day on Friday,  but then he tricked everybody  and took the personal day  on Monday?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, sick day.  He took a sick day.  Sick day on Monday.  We were joking  that he was setting up  for the sick day for Friday.  With all the medication.  But he ended up  taking the sick day yesterday. 
[02:59:00]  Sick day yesterday, yes.  And God damn it,  I didn't even know.  We noted slowly,  there was like,  I don't think Jimmy  was here for this.  We noted slowly  that on his desk  and things,  certain cold medications  were showing up.  He was literally  setting up for a sick day.  So it's like,  all right,  he's kind of gearing up.  So like if he calls in,  people would go,  he called in,  they'd be going,  yeah,  but I did see the medicine  on the desk.  I saw the medicine there.  Oh, it's textbook shit.  It was calling in sick  in the first degree.  Steve, come in please.  He should be here  to defend himself. 
[02:59:30]  So basically Steve  first,  about two hours ago  said,  all right, Sam,  what do you think of this  for a yellow flag?  A yellow handkerchief  tied to a Super Bowl.  Did he mean for the  March on Sunday?  Iraq is chomping  at the bit  and he doesn't have  any food in his mouth.  So I thought I'd let  the horse at the mic then.  And I said,  I'm teasing,  of course,  Iraq.  And I said,  what are you,  why?  No.  What?  And he said, 
[03:00:00]  you know,  like when you throw  in the yellow flag.  Oh.  And I said,  here you are.  We're talking  about the flag.  And I said,  no,  no,  not like a yellow flag  like in sports,  like on his paddle.  Right.  You know,  we do that thing  that says green,  yellow.  Yeah.  Oh,  he said.  And then I noticed  during the break,  he came in  and looked at your paddle.  Yes.  To figure out  what it was.  Yeah.  Iraq?  No,  finish, 
[03:00:30]  and then I'll tell you  what else happened.  Oh,  okay.  Oh, no.  And now there is  a yellow paddle.  A yellow paddle.  Which is completely  separate now,  which kind of,  you know.  An intern has been  assembling a yellow paddle.  For how long?  I don't know,  but I believe there  was a trip made  to get yellow  construction paper.  Two trips.  I'm being told.  Two trips.  Wow,  there's the yellow paddle  outside the studio.  That's a big paddle.  Bring it in.  Stand outside with it.  So here's the final product.  Yes.  The yellow paddle  that'll never be used. 
[03:01:00]  Yellow paddle.  Sorry.  So guys,  I mean,  if you guys reach a point  where you might have  to stop soon,  but you're pretty much  covered.  You gotta just slow it out  a little bit.  There's the yellow paddle.  You don't necessarily  have to stop.  Just be aware  that it might be dangerous  to keep your speed up.  A ruler was actually  obviously purchased.  Yes,  yes,  I see a new ruler,  a regular,  your standard school  12-inch ruler  was purchased.  Money went into this  as well.  Iraq,  what do you got  to add to this? 
[03:01:30]  Hold on,  did somebody say  that I want one  that I want a yellow paddle  that's visible  from Google Earth?  I know.  Why so large?  This is giant.  We're gonna find out  all that.  Iraq,  what do you got?  It's a lot bigger than...  Well,  to back up a little bit  on this,  this was one of those  times to take advantage  to the fact that  Steve wasn't listening  to the show.  so when they...  So when you made  this slight mention,  I knew he wasn't  paying attention.  I go,  Steve,  did you hear that? 
[03:02:00]  And he said,  what?  I said,  they're asking you  in the back,  they need a yellow flag.  Right?  And he goes,  oh,  and so I explained  to him,  I said,  you know,  the red and green one,  they need something,  you know,  a yellow flag.  Maybe like one of the ones  that they use  at soccer and football  that they throw  into the middle  of a console  so they know  to calm down.  So he started  developing the ball  and the sheet  and the rubber band thing  and then this wasn't working.  I guess this is where  Sam got involved.  I said,  absolutely,  that would be  a terrible idea.  And then there was  plans,  different trips 
[03:02:30]  for construction paper,  for staples,  for a ruler,  how this was all  going to lay out.  This has been going on  for almost three hours.  Jesus.  Has this paddle  been going on  for three hours?  Come on now.  Be honest.  Noah?  Well,  the entire process.  There's a microphone there.  The whole process  was about three hours.  Mic's not on.  Three hours  to get a dumb yellow paddle  that we're never  going to use?  For this!  See,  I'm just the opposite.  I'm thinking only three hours?  Wow.  You work fast. 
[03:03:00]  Why three hours?  Because you had to go out  and get the materials?  Yeah,  it was from nothing.  We had none of this.  Oh,  it was from nothing.  Wow.  Most things are  from nothing.  created from nothing.  It's just like  watching how it's made.  It's fantastic.  Believe it or not,  all that is  is a ruler,  a piece of yellow  construction paper,  and some staples.  Right.  One, two, three,  four, five,  six staples.  Dude, 
[03:03:30]  a kid in kindergarten  could have made this  in ten minutes.  Slightly better.  Earl could have made this  quicker,  and we know  about Earl.  Yeah.  Wait,  I don't understand  three hours.  Hey,  which is why  we got an EP,  you know what I'm saying?  What do you got there,  Steve,  on this paddle thing?  Yes,  on the paddle.  How long do we really  spend on this?  You know what?  I should really step back  because whatever Sam says  is completely unfabricated,  100% accurate,  so you might as well  The guy in the hat  is E-Rock.  It's sarcasm,  I think. 
[03:04:00]  No,  and Eric is completely  accurate as well,  so you know what?  Yeah,  oh my god.  Everything,  there is 100% veracity  behind everything  those two say.  Hey,  Sean William Scott.  And now we go with Sean.  I saw you.  Oh,  I saw you.  The cellar,  two days ago.  Oh,  no.  I was fucking there.  Oh,  no,  I didn't see you.  It's cool,  yeah.  What's up,  Sean?  How are you,  buddy?  Good to see you,  man.  Good to see you.  I'm so sorry,  I totally interrupted you.  That's right.  No,  I saw you.  Oh,  trust me,  it was filler  because we knew  you were downstairs. 
[03:04:30]  So we were beating up  the staff a little bit.  We're doing good.  Good.  Kevin Smith has been  coming in a lot  and I'm like,  will you get fucking  Sean William Scott in here  because he loves the show?  I'm so fucking sorry.  He's a champion  because that one day  we worked until six  and he came in  and I was like,  you're fucking awesome.  We told him.  The movie is sick.  I'm hearing two dicks.  It's fucking,  I was telling my mom,  she's like,  I go,  she goes,  how you doing?  I go,  I'm so fucking excited  about a couple of dicks  and my mom's like,  whoa,  I'm sorry?  I go,  it's a fucking movie,  mom,  what are you talking about?  She's like,  okay, 
[03:05:00]  and I keep thinking  how awesome it's going to be  when kids go to school  on Monday  and go,  man,  I surely loved  A Couple of Dicks.  I saw A Couple of Dicks  over the weekend.  Are they going to keep  the title of the movie?  I hope so,  man.  I hope so too.  That would be great.  The paper put  A Couple of Cops.  Was that the original title?  No,  it was always A Couple of Dicks  but I think that they're  They better not fuck  with that title.  That's a good title.  Dude,  he's fucking funny,  man.  Like,  on set,  we'll do shit  and like,  he'll throw stuff out 
[03:05:30]  and he's really,  because I worked with him  on Jane,  Son of the Bob  for that one scene.  He's funny as shit,  man.  Like,  he's really,  Tracy Morgan.  Braces in the guitar.  Oh,  yeah.  You remember that?  I'm fucking thinking,  I'm like,  yeah,  you're in the van  with the guy  singing those stupid songs.  Jay Mews is funny too.  He's not in this movie  but like,  when I worked with him then,  I was like,  that dude needs to work more  because he's really funny.  What's going on,  guys?  How you been?  Let's back up a little bit.  The last time you were in here,  I think you were promoting  role models,  right?  Yeah.  I think so,  yeah.  I finally fucking saw that movie  two months ago.  Yeah.  God damn,  is that a good movie. 
[03:06:00]  Oh,  cool.  Thanks,  bro.  I think more people  should have saw that movie.  Yeah.  And it's on demand right now  so,  you know,  I'm sure the money  will trickle down to you  if someone pops it up  on the DVR.  Exactly.  On demand or whatever.  I'll take it.  That little black kid  is a superstar now too.  He is.  He's like a little Eddie Murphy.  Right.  And I always,  because we,  he had to kind of stick  to the script  because they always had like,  what are they,  the handler,  you know,  like the,  because he's a little young kid.  Yeah.  And so the director  couldn't tell him, 
[03:06:30]  you know,  to swear more.  So I would be like,  dude,  tell me to fuck off.  Yeah.  And so he's like,  who,  really?  I'm like,  yeah,  fuck it.  And so he'd tell me,  he's like,  fuck you,  man.  I'm like,  yeah.  There's nothing better  than hearing a little  like 10 year old  tell me to fuck off  and slap me.  You're right.  He's like a mini old school  Eddie Murphy.  Totally dude.  And the movie was great.  And I remember you came in,  bro.  I think you might've been  promoting Mr. Woodcock.  Sorry.  But I would love to pull a take  because I think he even said,  fuck that movie.  I really want to talk about  this role models that I also did. 
[03:07:00]  And then finally the movie  came out and I saw it.  I was like,  right on.  I'm glad you dug it to you.  You're a funny motherfucker,  bro.  There's nothing better.  Thanks dude.  I mean,  I think the only thing  that makes my character funny  in role models  is the first scene  where I just come out  and I stick my fingers  up to Paul Rudd's face.  I go,  guess what I did last night?  And it's like,  right away,  you know,  this guy is just  one of the dudes.  And they always say  it's tough to,  you know,  act with kids and stuff  because they show you up.  But no,  you were right in there.  That's awesome.  Thanks, man.  How was Billy Bob Thornton?  Was he difficult?  Because we saw that  in the interview that he did 
[03:07:30]  where he was like a total dick  and it's like,  is he like that on the set  or is he okay?  Not at all, dude.  I saw that too.  I was fucking shocked  because he was  He was in a bad mood that day.  He must have been, man.  Like, I don't know  because he was always  so cool, man.  So down to earth.  We would rip on that mood  for Woodcock.  I think I told you  we'd watch like,  what was it?  We would watch  American Idol  when Carrie Underwood was on.  We're like,  we want to fuck her so bad.  And like,  and we knew  we'd never meet her  and he was totally chill  but we'd rip on Woodcock  and we're like,  this movie fucking sucks.  Like, it's so bad. 
[03:08:00]  When you were ripping on it  when you were filming it?  Totally, dude.  You just knew, right?  Oh, yeah.  It's so sad, man.  There's nothing worse  than going to a movie set  knowing that this  could end my career.  You know what I mean?  I can't afford  to make mistakes.  I'm not Vince Vaughn.  You know what I mean?  I'm just like,  holy shit,  I might be going back  to Home Depot soon.  But he was totally cool  and so when I saw  that interview  or I heard the interview,  I was like,  that's not him, man.  I mean,  have you had him on the show?  No, unfortunately not.  He's actually,  he's cool.  Something must have happened before. 
[03:08:30]  He would have got away  with that shit on our show.  Yeah, yeah, it's true.  We would have had a war.  Somehow you never know, though.  He might have had  fucking, you know,  a shitty day or something.  Well, what happened recently  when his daughter...  Yeah, yeah.  Sometime his daughter  was convicted of murder.  A little murder.  What?  Billy Bob Thornton's daughter?  Oh, yeah.  It's a big story, man.  It's a strange story.  I mean, I don't even know,  like, I mean,  but it says in the news  that his daughter was like,  man, that's so fucked.  You know,  I was going to call him.  It's a little murder.  What?  How the fuck did I not hear this?  It's everywhere.  Is this today?  No, it's been...  It was a while ago. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah, the last couple weeks.  Wow.  You ever see that  outtake with him  and John Cusack  sitting at the fucking table  when they were making that movie?  What was it called?  Oh, Bandits?  No, not Bandits.  No, it's the one  that air for...  And he just goes into Carl  from fucking...  No way, really?  It's so fucking funny, man.  That's awesome.  It's great.  I haven't seen that.  It doesn't seem like  he would just break in  and doing that,  especially so many years  after actually doing it.  But then to do it  and to see him as Billy Bob, 
[03:09:30]  not as Carl doing it,  you almost forget  that he did it  in the first place.  You're like,  well, he did a really...  Here, here it is.  Pot that up a little bit.  Oh, no way.  It's an outtake of this.  Yeah, you got that.  It's really...  This is cool.  Holy shit.  Look at him.  His face totally changes.  Oh, sorry about it.  Who was that on the phone?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Carl?  Well, it isn't like  there's none of your  fucking business. 
[03:10:00]  I've done it with my wife  on the phone.  Lovely gladys.  Look at John Keesock  so uncomfortable.  Yeah.  Big old fat girl.  Oh, my God.  His face totally changes.  No, I ain't having dinner  with her.  Hell no.  She's had enough dinner  in her lifetime.  Like I said,  she's a big old fat gal.  She eats over at the subway  like that boy  in them TV commercials.  Jared?  She has a...  I recognize his name. 
[03:10:30]  She has her a couple  of meatball sandwiches  at lunchtime  and then run dinner time  she'll have two or three more.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Then, of course,  she comes back  at the house  after she bought  her a new dress or two  off of Omar the Tentmaker.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That is awesome, dude.  Nice to say.  Well,  if you had to live  with a son of a bitch,  you might not say that.  Now, let me out of here.  Sure.  Yeah. 
[03:11:00]  Want some more  that creme brulee?  No.  Why don't I eat you  some of that pudding?  That's good for you.  Oh, my gosh, dude.  That's classic.  Bryce Cattler  smiles and walks away.  Dude.  Isn't that great?  He is.  That's who he is, man.  He's funny as shit.  That's fucking funny, man.  That is awesome.  He is fucking hilarious.  When you forget it's him  because it looks  nothing like him.  Like, I watched  Sling Blade  and just go like,  that isn't Billy Bob Thornton.  Yeah.  It's not him.  It's crazy.  And then when you see him  like that  and he completely puts  the face on  and the voice  and you're like, wow. 
[03:11:30]  And like, it is amazing.  That's literally like,  I saw the thing with him  and that interview  I was like,  that's fucking,  he's funny as shit.  Like, you know,  they made him seem  like such a dick  but he's not.  He's awesome.  But like, I saw that,  I re-watched the clip  with, um,  who's the director  with Lily Tomlin?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that's so good, man.  You fucking bitch!  I've been working  on this fucking movie for,  and he fucking like  calls her a cunt.  You cunt!  And he's like,  Lily Tomlin,  all right, sure,  just go sabotage 
[03:12:00]  your movie.  You fucking bitch!  And it's so amazing.  He's like,  handing shit,  and I love  the clip before  when he's in the car.  Yeah, yeah.  And like,  and Dustin's in the,  in the middle,  um, Lily's,  and then I think  Naomi Watts is in the back,  and,  and then Lily Tomlin  looks to Dustin,  he's like,  fuck you two,  you motherfucker!  You can't say that  at Dustin at all.  That's amazing, dude.  Don't you wish  you could have been  on that set?  Yeah.  Oh my God.  We love that clip.  One of the best scenes  in that clip  is when he walks 
[03:12:30]  out the door,  and it's just a set,  but he walks out  and then comes back.  He's still yelling  in the camera.  Yeah.  He comes in the other door,  and you hear like,  you motherfucker!  He like slammed the door  for effect.  Yeah.  But then he walks  back around.  The whole set is shaking  from him slamming the door.  And I love the ADs,  like,  I was showing people out,  you know,  but he's like,  okay, just go.  Okay, this is bad.  Elizabeth wants  to ask you something.  Elizabeth in Philly.  Elizabeth.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, madam.  Jimmy's birthday.  Shut up.  Why don't you tell us 
[03:13:00]  all about how you  banged Jessica Simpson?  Oh, Jesus.  Wait, what was that?  She wants to know how you,  she said,  can you tell us  how you banged  Jessica Simpson?  Yeah, you mentioned it  on another radio show,  and you've been in  to promote all these movies,  and then not mention  the O&A.  I wish it was the truth.  I don't think there.  No, I did say that,  but I was like,  I went on a radio station.  It was Who Kid?  Yeah.  Who's right across the hall.  He comes on our show,  and we're like,  yeah, we're good friends  with Sean William Scott.  He goes, oh, yeah?  How good of friends  are you with him?  He admitted on our show  that he banged  Jessica Simpson.  I'm like,  that motherfucker. 
[03:13:30]  Dude, that's not even true,  that fucker.  I was like,  I said to him,  he goes,  I heard Nick Lachey  is mad at you.  I go, why?  Because I fucked his wife?  Oh, shit.  And then I was joking,  and then I added to it afterwards.  I'm like, no,  I didn't fuck his wife.  They didn't put that on there.  They didn't put that on the internet.  It was on like IMDB thing.  Sean William Scott  says he fucks Jessica Simpson.  It's not a bad rumor to hash that.  No, I mean,  that's kind of why I said it.  I'm trying to spread  as many of those as possible. 
[03:14:00]  And you told  the Steve Martin story  on our show.  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah, because everyone's  asking you to retell that.  It's weird, right, dude?  Like, that was, yeah.  I mean, you've had him on?  No, no.  You know him, right?  I've met him one time briefly.  What was he like?  He was walking by.  I got a photo with him.  He had the same face he has  on the cheaper than a dozen,  fucking cheaper than a dozen posts.  He fucking hated me, man.  Pink Panther 2 was on the plane.  I was flying.  Pink Panther 2 was on. 
[03:14:30]  And I gotta be honest,  I mean, really,  a couple of good laughs.  I was actually hoping  that it was an Air France flight.  I was so fucking disgusted.  Dude, you were hilarious  the other night, man.  I came in, like,  in the middle of your show.  I didn't know what you were playing,  but we just, like,  randomly went in there.  You're hilarious.  Oh, thanks, man.  I was like,  that was the asshole in the back  trying to get your attention.  Oh, dude, I really didn't know you were there.  No, no, dude.  That was the dick.  Did you have that man removed?  They put me in the corner  with some cold french fries  to just, like, feed him something.  Comedy seller, obviously. 
[03:15:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Right on.  Oh, let me know  the next time you're going.  Totally, dude.  I don't even know why you're here  because you don't have to  promote Ice Age 3.  This is a monster movie.  I'm whoring out  for an animated movie, dude.  You don't have to promote this.  You're talking about money  trickling in.  That Ice Age money  fucking pours in like a dump truck.  How good is that money?  Dude, I haven't seen it yet.  Wait, you weren't in there.  A little bit, though.  Were you in one and two?  No.  I was in the second one,  but I bet you, like,  well, I'm guessing, like,  you know, in the Shrek movies,  those guys made, like,  10 million on the second one.  So maybe, like, Ray Romano  and Dennis Leary 
[03:15:30]  and those guys got a ton,  but I did it for my nephew  that, you know,  I did the second one  and then I watched it.  I was like,  fuck, man,  this is my best performance.  Animated.  You know, I was like,  this is so sad.  So I did the third one  and I was like,  maybe I'll make some cash.  How is that to do?  Is it, like, easy work,  relatively speaking?  Oh, I mean, it is.  I mean, I'm not putting  on oil fires, you know,  but, like...  They just gotta, like...  But it's kind of stressful, dude.  It's kind of, like...  I mean, it's not stressful,  but, like,  you literally are out there  with your dick out,  pretty much,  because you don't have  another actor out there  and then you just have to 
[03:16:00]  act like an asshole.  But I've done that  quite a bit in films, so...  What do they do?  Kind of give you a picture  and go,  here's what your character  is gonna look like.  Pretty much.  And then you just read lines  and you just have to  act like an ass.  Did you have to, like,  put on a wacky voice  or could you just use  your voice?  Kind of.  Well, the same voice  that I've done  in every other film,  which is pretty much, like,  Captain Asshole.  So what's new, man?  So what girls  have you been banging?  Oh, man.  I gotta hear about this.  I don't know.  I'm just trying to stay away  from any felonies.  That's pretty much  all I try to do these days, 
[03:16:30]  but, uh...  No, yeah, well...  Any scandals?  Well, no, no,  no big scandals and stuff.  I've had, you know,  I'm pretty much...  I'm a single guy now.  I love the story.  You weren't in the closet.  It was the girl  in the closet, right?  Yeah, yeah.  That was so good.  It's our producer  who's in the closet.  Yeah, that was good.  That was a biggie.  And then the chick  burnt the girl's clothes.  It was a big debacle.  But now I notice  what I had to do  because I kind of... 
[03:17:00]  I tripped up  on the last relationship  by not emptying  the house out.  Which one was that?  Is that the girl  that I met  at the news channel?  Yeah, the girl  that was in the closet.  Oh.  No, then it's the Channel 11.  Yeah, the Channel 11 girl  was the one girl  that found the girl  in the closet.  Oh, right, okay.  But then, like,  I realized,  here's what you gotta do.  Once you're finally,  like, single  and all the steady  girl relationships  are out of your life,  you have to go 
[03:17:30]  through your house  with a full-size  fucking garbage bag.  and I mean,  start in one corner  of upstairs  and end up  at the other corner  of downstairs  and throw away...  You know how many boxes  of fucking tampons  are in my fucking house?  I swear to you,  there had to be  five boxes of tampons  in my house.  You got a lot of...  Various bathrooms.  You got a lot of bathrooms,  though.  Yeah, I know,  but I don't have,  like, vagina.  Yeah, but it's so hard  because I'm not using  the fucking things.  The girls you fuck  are not even old enough  to have their periods.  I know! 
[03:18:00]  Jesus Christ.  And then I go in the shower  and I realize,  now I gotta throw away  shampoo that I...  I wouldn't use.  I'm not using Pantene  for fucking bleached hair.  You know?  And I realize, like,  this is the shit  I gotta fucking throw out.  I gotta throw out  fucking things  a pumice  for your heels.  It's not like  I'm using pumice  for my heels.  So, the garbage bag  was completely full. 
[03:18:30]  Out to the garbage.  Boom!  Start anew!  That's it.  Now I don't have to worry  that, you know,  someone's gonna open  something up  that I gotta explain.  Not that I gotta explain  anything.  Yeah, you're pretty  straightforward.  But I don't like  having a fucking,  you know,  oh, what, that?  Yeah, well,  the girl leaves  their tampons  over my house.  You deal with crazies, right?  You're married.  Yeah, yeah.  They're all  a bit crazy.  No, I'm in a very  happy relationship.  Four wisdom teeth  out yesterday.  So it's enchanting  around my house.  It's enchanting.  Dude, it all depends.  Did you knock him out? 
[03:19:00]  That would've been  easier.  I run into  the craziest shit.  Like, I got a text  message from this girl  that I banged.  I love how you're on it.  Yeah, dude,  I'm gonna get fucked  anyways.  Like, this girl,  like, three months ago,  she might be listening  to this right now.  Who gives a shit?  Anyways, she sent me  a text I haven't  heard from her  in, like,  two in the morning.  Imagine getting  this text, okay?  Hey, haven't heard  from you in a while. 
[03:19:30]  I ran into some girl,  some guy that said  you were physically  abusive to some  other girl,  and she used your  name and this story  for her grant essay  to get into NYU.  And I'm like,  what the fuck?  It's two in the morning,  I'm like,  are you fucking kidding me?  I'm like,  first of all,  I would never,  dude, never,  like, I would suck  their toes just to see  if they could suck my dick.  I don't give a shit,  you know what I mean?  I don't care.  And I'm like,  this is fucking weird.  And I've only,  I mean, like,  I know the girls I've dated. 
[03:20:00]  I mean,  they're not going NYU.  You know what I mean?  They're not students.  Not for 15 years.  You know what I mean?  Exactly.  So I'm like,  what the fuck?  So I can't sleep now,  so I send them messages  to the girl,  I'm like,  what are you talking about?  This is fucking weird.  So she,  of course,  and I'm thinking,  is this a ploy  to get me to call her?  Because I haven't called her  in three or four months.  Pretty good.  Like, what a fucking  shitty way to do it.  Just call me and say  you want to suck dick.  It's like, fine.  So all of a sudden,  like,  oh, that's so bad.  Hey, go see Ice Age.  Anyway,  so I'm like,  I don't know 
[03:20:30]  any girls going to NYU.  I don't really hang out  with the smart ones.  I'm confused.  You know,  give me some more information.  So as it comes out,  literally until I just  came to see you guys,  all of a sudden,  the girl says,  I said,  you know,  what's the girl's name?  She says Juliana.  I said,  Juliana,  I only know two Julianas  that are from Brazil  and they're definitely  not speaking English  very well  and they're not going to NYU.  And I'm like,  this is bullshit.  So then,  of course,  she,  because I said,  I'm going to call my lawyer  and so get the name  because I'm like,  you know,  like if this person  is telling people 
[03:21:00]  that I'm beating her  and stuff like that,  I don't even know her  because I've heard  other weird shit,  like I've dated girls  I don't even know.  I'm like,  what are they hot?  Like I'll date them.  I mean,  just come out and say,  give me your number.  But like,  I have no shame.  But like,  any chance I can get.  But basically,  I said,  so then the girl  finally comes out  and says,  actually,  this,  a guy told me  who's friends with her  and said it was somebody  that was in American Pie.  I'm like,  you bitch!  Since two in the morning!  I've been thinking,  like some girl's thinking  that I beat her. 
[03:21:30]  And I was like,  just come out  and say you want to go on a date  because that's all it was.  And I'm thinking like,  you would deal,  you still probably deal with it,  right?  Even though you're married?  No,  not really.  Don't you have girls  coming up to you all the time?  Oh,  well,  yeah,  because I'm a good looking guy.  So of course,  that never ends.  Girls,  I almost think once you're married,  you get a chance for more pussy.  Don't you think?  I mean,  like,  it's all of a sudden girls,  you don't put out that vibe.  Apparently he's right.  You're not throwing out that vibe anymore  so they get intrigued  because you're not trying to bang them.  Totally.  It's weird, 
[03:22:00]  man.  Yeah.  It's more of a challenge.  So there's my life.  Ice Age 3.  Woman beater right here.  Ice Age 3.  Ice Age 3,  woman beater.  You're a beautiful.  What animal do you play in Ice Age 3?  I play a possum.  A possum,  okay.  You know who's in the movie though?  Simon Pegg.  Oh yeah?  Do you like him?  He's fucking great, man.  He's fucking funny.  He's hilarious.  He's a really funny guy.  So the movie's actually really good.  It's one of those things where,  I don't think Fox is going to mind,  but if you get really baked.  Most movies are really good  when you get baked,  but that kind of movie.  And then you play Pink Floyd. 
[03:22:30]  And sync it up.  And sync it up.  I think the funny thing is  everybody says...  We all try that.  No, it's when the lion roars  Yeah, exactly, dude.  The first time.  Let's try that now.  It's at the second roar.  Right.  You know what I'm trying to find,  by the way,  is the pastor  with the baby voice.  Oh, we got...  Dude, I cannot find it.  Little Marky.  What is it?  Little Marky.  How long are you going to be  in the facility?  Because I know we have you  until 10.30,  but if you have a little time,  we'll get you a copy now. 
[03:23:00]  Okay, yeah.  I mean,  I'll say I go on YouTube  and put...  Because I always put  passers that have demon voices  or something like that.  Yeah, we'll find it.  Yeah, that's one of our  favorite things.  We haven't talked about  Little Marky in a long time,  but...  What is the last weird  scandalous thing  that you guys saw  that you heard about?  Oh, shit.  Like the weirdest...  I mean, of course,  there's a lot that's going on  the last week,  but what's...  Well, the Michael Jackson stuff  is terrific.  Fucked up, right?  Billy Mays.  Yeah.  Come on.  Ed McMahon.  The fact that everyone  throws a heart attack,  he got fucked to death.  That didn't happen. 
[03:23:30]  I can't believe  that three of the Lakers  fucked Ed McMahon to death.  And there's going to be  charges now.  There's going to be  charges filed.  Because they said  they were just bringing  him a jersey.  Wait, what are you  talking about, dude?  Ed McMahon died.  I know, but he didn't  get fucked to death.  All right, all right.  Look at Sean.  Three of the Lakers.  Jesus, Sean.  Sean William Scott.  And Phil Jackson  drove them.  That's a scandal.  Hey, a lot of people  talk about your commentary  on Dude, Where's My Car?  Were you baked for that?  Because people love it.  Oh, you know what? 
[03:24:00]  We were wasted.  Wasted.  But not baked.  Just drunk as shit.  I've never heard it,  but I got to.  Because too many people  bring it up and say that.  Really?  Yeah, that you guys  were hilarious on the commentary.  Well, I don't think  we were funny.  I think it was just funny  that we were doing  commentary for such a bad movie.  Right.  And the commentary  was better than the movie.  Because we were just like,  oh, good.  No, Jack Daniels.  And the whole time,  we kept...  And then when I would leave,  Ash would be like,  yeah, Sean had...  You know, a cold sore  that I dig.  He's sucking dicks. 
[03:24:30]  I'm like,  I didn't know this.  So I come back and he's like,  hey, thanks for the drink.  I'm like, cool.  No worries, Ash.  I watched the fucking thing.  I'm like,  you motherfucker.  Fucking saying  I had fucking herpes and shit.  But like,  yeah,  I had a guy  when we did interviews.  I had actually a guy  that goes,  he goes,  dude,  I gotta tell you,  the movie's fucking horrible.  But that's the best commentary  I've ever seen.  I'm like,  thanks, dude.  Why the fuck  is everybody so honest?  You're honest.  That's why.  They feel like  they can be honest in front of you.  I think so.  Some of that commentary,  though,  is great.  Like,  Kevin Smith has 
[03:25:00]  some really good commentary  on there  where they're obviously,  like,  you know,  I think one time  a few of the people  have been tipping some back.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Why not?  And he's a funny fucker.  Anyways,  that guy is so good.  But like,  did you see,  he did the Carnegie Hall?  I was there, yeah.  You were there?  Dude, it was like,  I can imagine a guy.  First one I've seen,  it's amazing.  Imagine a director  that popular.  Just him on a stage  at Carnegie Hall  and he had those people.  It's incredible.  Amazing.  I was bummed  I had to leave early.  It's like,  fuck. 
[03:25:30]  Yeah,  he's funny, man.  One of the only times  I didn't want to leave early.  You should come to set, man.  It's pretty wild.  Well,  you don't have time, right?  No, no, no.  We've had this discussion  all day  with celebrities  inviting us places  and then we're not sure  if you mean it or not.  Oh, I mean it.  I would love to go  to the set  of the Kevin Smith movie.  Dude, Kevin's not  like everybody.  He's not full of shit.  Kevin's a very much.  I'm not going to tweet him  and go,  Kevin, remember when you said?  No, dude,  he would love to have you on.  It's true.  He is so down-to-earth.  He's so cool, man.  We'll have to figure it out  because I would love to.  That's a great movie 
[03:26:00]  to come to visit.  I've never been on a movie set.  Really?  I'd be like a little kid.  Dude, this is a...  I've never been on one.  Tracy Morgan is hilarious.  It's fucking...  John McClane.  I know, man.  It's this sea of people  and then there's like...  It looks like there's  nothing ever going to get done.  There's too many people  to shut them all up  and yet all of a sudden  they're going,  rolling speed!  And everybody shuts  the fuck up.  It's amazing.  It's true, dude.  Everyone listens.  And then everybody's watching  and they're going,  fuck, I could do that.  And they're all going, 
[03:26:30]  wow, that's what it is?  These guys suck.  Are those guys bitter  because they set up  for like 12 hours  and you guys just  kind of roll onto the set,  do you think?  Oh, for sure.  They hate us so much.  And then they have four hours  of breakdown.  They're the ones that have families.  They're the ones,  all they do is they work  to make us look good.  And we come with BLTs  and we're eating sandwiches  and shit's in our mouth.  There's an assistant  to wipe your mouth.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Somebody's holding the umbrella  and they're like,  he's a fucking guy.  Because living in New York,  you get to see a lot of movie sets  being set up  and it takes for fucking ever. 
[03:27:00]  You never see a celebrity,  by the way.  Yeah, you roll in  for a minute or two  or whatever, an hour.  Yeah, we're sitting in the trailer  watching like, you know,  Unbreakable  or some movies,  stuff like that.  Like, can I get a couple beers?  And like,  two seconds later,  there's like a six pack.  Like, wow.  And then everybody else  is busting their ass,  setting up the lights.  And we're like,  we're coming in right here.  Like, wow,  that smells like beer.  I guess he's been drinking  for the last hour.  But they'll stop it.  Like, they'll start to go,  we got speed.  And then they'll just stop it  because, ah, I hear a noise. 
[03:27:30]  Stop.  And the whole production  just fucking stops  because a yoo-hoo truck  beeped three blocks away.  Or the actor's like,  I'm distracted.  I hear a train.  And it's like,  I think it sounds,  it's like,  are you fucking kidding me?  You're that bad of an actor.  Like, you can't act  through a train, right?  Just go through it, right?  Yeah, it's ridiculous.  You gotta come to say it.  It is so funny.  You'll be shocked.  Where are we at with this, Jimmy?  This is our discussion all morning.  Kevin Smith is...  Celebrity's inviting us places.  Kevin is not a phony.  He's not a phony either, man.  I'm telling you,  Kevin would find a way  to let you guys sit there  and watch.  And it's a fucking amazing process 
[03:28:00]  to watch.  No, I would go.  He'll make it fun too  because most movies are actually,  it's fascinating  because you just go,  fuck, is this seriously it?  Like, you're just sitting around  and you're like,  this is so boring.  It's so much waiting.  Like, there'll be times  where we're like,  we'll shoot for what,  maybe a half hour  and then four hours will go by  and you only shoot  for half hour, 40 minutes.  Kevin said this is cool though  because he's funny as shit  and he'll,  he's the kind of director  where you come visit,  you see it all get set up  and he's just funny,  he's laid back  and you guys will be like,  drinking or whatever,  smoking something  behind the monitors  and he'll be throwing out lines. 
[03:28:30]  He's the director.  He's like,  okay, say this, Sean,  say this, say this  and it's hilarious  and you get to see  these things develop  and then like all of a sudden,  yeah.  Other sets,  like,  I would definitely not recommend  you go in to visit  like the sequel of Woodcock.  Nothing would ever make that,  but like...  Kevin's a fuck,  Kevin's vibe on the set  is the same as it is.  He'd be welcome there, dude.  I mean,  he's not being polite.  He would welcome you there.  If I don't feel like I'm imposing,  I'd be there tomorrow.  You wouldn't be imposing.  Dude, definitely.  We told the story.  If the lights are on  and the music's playing,  just bring that up. 
[03:29:00]  Son of a bitch.  Greg Brady invited me  to his house in LA  and I took him up on it.  Next thing I know,  he's like trying to figure out leftovers.  His name's Barry Williams.  Wait, what?  It's Greg Brady.  What'd you say?  I was at Greg Brady's house.  Yes.  For real.  And then he served me leftovers.  He was.  His name's not Gary.  I've known him for years.  No, no.  He gave you leftovers?  Yeah, yeah.  It's so much better  he gave you leftovers  than like a...  That's so great.  I find it hysterical.  He was at the refrigerator  with his wife,  whispering like,  what are we gonna serve?  I swear to God. 
[03:29:30]  I swear to God.  I haven't seen a royalty check  in fucking years.  Sean, I so obviously was imposing.  They gave you like a...  Like for like a dessert,  he gave you like a Nutrigain bar.  Like those Nutrigain bars.  Like the Apple version.  You're like,  dude, is this a breakfast thing?  I guess you could, you know,  drive with this  at least, like get the fuck  out of my house.  What was weird though,  he had all the Brady Bunch episodes  on VHS.  How weird is that?  Oh, no.  You would think he would have been  in the DVD world.  Now let me show you  the Johnny Bravo episode again.  You're gonna love this one.  I think I gotta go back. 
[03:30:00]  But then he had home movies  and just personal pictures.  It was weird.  That is classic.  He's a big TV icon, you know.  Yeah.  That's the one who dated  the hot girl, right?  Or married the hot girl, Greg?  No.  I don't know.  Oh, no, that's Peter.  Peter, okay.  See, I only know  there's the middle one.  Peter.  What were you gonna say?  No, no, see, you ought to go.  Michael Luckenlund.  The other one.  Michael Luckenlund.  He's the one that got the D-Way.  Shitty mustache.  Yeah.  He's awful looking now.  With the horrendous hairline.  The Brady's does not mess.  They did not fucking age well at all.  Except the mother.  Dude, I'm so sorry.  Oh, I got it.  I got it. 
[03:30:30]  I knew there was something  I wanted to tell you guys.  I'm so sorry for interrupting.  So I went on your website  like I was going  and checking all the clips.  What is foundry music?  Dude, one of my favorite,  favorite things  is when you had  the Brady chick out  and you said,  okay, thanks so much.  He hung up on her.  Oh, it was too sick.  Oh, dude, it was so good.  And you're like,  oh, my God,  I can't believe you just did that.  Oh, that was terrible.  Oh, that was so good.  Because she's talking about her book.  You're like,  all right, thanks.  And you just hung up.  It was 15 seconds.  We're like,  are you psyched about your new book?  She said yes.  We're like, all right, thanks. 
[03:31:00]  I love it.  I rewound that so many times.  They gave me so much joy.  Oh, my God.  Did she call back?  Did her people call back  and say,  something happened?  Oh, yeah.  Did you answer it?  Nah.  Why would we?  Listen to the in-depth  Robin Leach interview.  That was also a gem.  What is that one?  It makes that look like  a fucking 60 minutes piece.  Oh.  Can we talk about it or no?  It was just that short.  Do we have it?  Find the Robin Leach  before we let Sean go.  He's got to get out of here.  Dude, that,  that when you're like, 
[03:31:30]  all right, thanks.  And you hung up  and it was like a moment pause.  I think it was you.  What are you guys starting to laugh at?  Like, oh, my God.  Yeah, as he said,  oh, my God.  You're horrible.  Yeah, that's what he said.  You're horrible.  He's constantly hanging up on you.  We might have it on YouTube.  Let's see.  Well, we have a...  It's already funny.  Oh, right.  David, can you put you on hold, David?  We have a...  Dave, hold on, please.  This may be a while.  We have a celebrity guest calling in.  We have Robin Leach calling in  and we can't make him laugh.  Yes. 
[03:32:00]  Remember Robin Leach?  Famous for Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.  Famous.  From the 80s and I guess maybe the early 90s  and I guess he's working on something new these days.  Yes, Robin.  Robin Leach.  Very excited to talk to Robin Leach.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  How are you?  Gentlemen, a very good morning to you.  Very good morning indeed, sir.  Before we get into what you're working on,  I need to know what was the most expensive house you ever were in?  You know, it pales by today's rates. 
[03:32:30]  The most expensive house we were in was a...  All right, back to the day.  Robin Leach, everybody.  The great Robin Leach.  Robin Leach.  Still going strong.  God bless him.  No way, dude.  Probably one of the best interviews with Robin I've ever heard.  We learned a lot today.  Yes.  Good to know he's still doing it.  God bless his soul.  Dude, no way.  Did you know you were going to do that?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, my gosh, dude.  And asking him the question he's been asked probably a million fucking times, too, right? 
[03:33:00]  And he's just ready to say it.  It had to be...  Dude, that makes me so happy.  Oh, we have the Marsha Brady?  Marsha Brady.  Dude, that is awesome.  You guys are my idols.  We love those.  Oh, my gosh, dude.  Did he call back, too?  They did?  Probably.  I don't know.  We have to feel the cleanup after us.  Oh, yeah, we just fuck it all up, and then everyone else has to explain.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You fuckos will do that to me when I'm doing America Pie 20.  So, Sean, what is it like playing America Pie? 
[03:33:30]  Well, you know, the first time we click...  Hey, you fuckers!  If you ever do another Woodcock, yes.  Do we have the Marsha Brady?  Yeah, all right.  Nice.  Hold on, we're going to try this again.  Maureen McCormick.  Good morning.  Hi.  Hey, Maureen, you got a book out, right?  I do, I do.  It's called Here's the Story.  Oh, great, thanks.  Joe, so...  Oh, great, thanks to the...  That is so great. 
[03:34:00]  Oh, my gosh.  Do you go home feeling so good?  Like, just, you know, you did something special.  Like, oh, great, thanks.  What do you imagine, like, what went through her mind?  Oh, the phone must have had a problem.  Nobody would be that big a dick.  Did she come on to the show where she was drunk?  You ever...  No.  Damn, I wish.  Wasn't there one where one of the girls from Brady Bunch was like, she was like, I thought  it was her.  I thought she was like...  And she's doing a radio thing and her kid was like, she's probably drunk again. 
[03:34:30]  And I think it was her.  Oh, wasn't that...  Wasn't that her?  Who the fuck was it?  I don't know.  Cindy.  Cindy.  It was Cindy Bink.  Was it?  Yeah.  I don't remember.  So it wasn't her.  It was the other...  No, it was the younger one.  The younger one.  You have time to hear our Ed McMahon interview?  Please.  I have time.  Not Ed McMahon.  I got time.  Ed Asner.  Oh, yes.  I have time.  Yes, of course.  Oh, that was horrible.  Ant was playing poker.  I was doing the show with Joe Rogan.  We were out there in LA because Ant was in a poker tournament, so he was doing...  Rogan's an animal.  So we were just killing time and interviewing celebrities. 
[03:35:00]  Who else was there?  Rogan and...  He's funny, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Is he a good guy?  We love Joe.  Yeah.  And he can kill you with, like, his finger.  Oh, it's the Kristen Bell?  Oh, he's a fighter, too.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, wow.  All right, before that, we're doing a whole montage now for you.  Yeah, sweet.  She's hot, huh?  We found something you really like.  Yeah.  Kristen Bell, we had a great interview with her.  Yeah.  We've got to interrupt this news story.  We've got a big star on the phone.  Kristen Bell, the star of Forgetting Sarah Marshall. 
[03:35:30]  Kristen.  Yes?  Congratulations on the new movie.  Are you excited?  I'm so excited.  Awesome.  That is so awesome.  They're really funny when you hear them back to back to back, too.  Dude, it's so awesome.  They're funny when you hear them back to back.  Oh, my God.  I feel so embarrassed, dude.  I know.  It's not at all.  Oh, awesome.  Awesome.  Oh. 
[03:36:00]  Is there another one?  The stupid tits one?  Yeah.  Do we have that one?  What?  We'll get it.  Awesome.  It was Amanda Peet.  Travis just reminded me.  Amanda Peet, really hot.  And then I was like, yeah, but your tits suck.  Oh, he was terrible.  I forgot exactly what he said, but I made fun of her.  I make you so many enemies right now, dude.  You got the Ed Asner?  Yeah, the Ed Asner is like a...  It's slightly longer, but it's okay.  The Ed Asner one was fucking awful.  We got him over to the table.  It was Opie, myself, Rogan, and we're sitting there, and it just didn't go the way it should  have.  Well, should we explain what we do to people? 
[03:36:30]  First of all, you told him you were me, which fucked it up for some reason.  Somehow he thought you were Anthony.  Oh, yeah, I didn't say that, though, but...  So you had a chance to bang for the bell, and also now she's like, what a dick.  I'm off playing poker somewhere.  Sure, that's right.  My ass handed to me.  I'll let you in on the thing, because maybe it helps when you listen to this.  When we have some guests in here, and it just sucks, but they have people around and  stuff, we'll go, oh, they're telling you you have to go, Sean.  And you're like, you get confused, but like, oh, well, they wouldn't just say that to me. 
[03:37:00]  Right, right.  And it's a way to get out of...  I guess I've got to go.  It's a way to get out of interviews, because we don't know what else to fucking do.  We don't want to tell the guy he sucks, right?  Right.  But in this case, we went a little further with it.  So, Ed Asner.  Oh, fantastic.  You trying to get rid of me?  Yeah, sort of.  What are you doing, Ben?  Ben, what are you doing?  Sign language.  What's the sign language?  Ed, that's Ben.  He's our producer.  And he decides when a guest is getting a little too boring, and that was the sign that he  usually gives.  Or disrespect to Ed Asner. 
[03:37:30]  We're having a good interview with Ed Asner.  I can tell you, Anthony, that that's the last time I'll ever be on your show.  No, that was...  Yeah, Ben.  See?  I've suffered your insults enough.  I certainly wouldn't come back again.  I'll be glad to talk to you about the Columbia documentary some other time when he's not around.  Can I talk to you, Ed?  I'm a big fan.  I love you.  Absolutely.  Thank you.  Make sure that he's not in there.  He does this all the time.  I'm a big fan.  I'm very happy to have you on the show.  He is a destroyer. 
[03:38:00]  He's a destroyer.  A destroyer.  He's like Gordon Gekko.  He builds nothing.  He liquidates.  He's a destroyer.  He's greasy.  Yes, he is.  I don't want to smell his shorts.  He's a Svengali.  In quotes, I don't want to smell his shorts.  Ed Asner.  Bravo.  The great Ed Asner.  The great Ed Asner.  Thank you, sir.  Very nice to meet you.  Thank you very much.  You're a destroyer.  He called you a destroyer.  Wait till Anthony hears this on the replay.  It was phenomenal. 
[03:38:30]  Hey, Jimmy, get back here, man.  I started sweating.  No, come on.  Give me a handshake, please.  Fuck you, Ed Asner.  Fuck you.  Dude, Ed Asner just said, fuck you.  Oh, that's so awesome.  Oh, that's phenomenal.  Fuck you.  The star of Up has a filthy mouth there, Sean.  Dude, that is great.  They go on and on.  Fuck.  We had Linda Blair on, and the only thing we would say to her is, the power of Christ come  tell you.  Oh, man, was that bad?  Also, one of my favorites is when it was Colin Hanks and Jack Black with the midget. 
[03:39:00]  It's always funny to me.  I sit at home when I'm sad sometimes.  I see, like, one of my bad movies is on TV, and I think about that clip of the little  middle, the small person, like, crying.  Like, Jack Black is confused and kind of uncomfortable, and they look at each other.  It was very uncomfortable.  It's so good.  For the new listeners, Colin Hanks, Tom Hanks' son, and Jack Black, they didn't know  what they were really getting into.  And this midget called us out of nowhere and said she wanted to become a stripper.  So we're like, well, come on down. 
[03:39:30]  We know a thing or two about strippers.  You can try it out.  We'll give you some pointers.  And as she's taking it off her clothes, she realizes it was a horrible idea and starts  crying in front of everyone while she's naked.  Nothing worse than a naked midget crying while Jack Black and, you know, Colin Hanks' son.  Sean has to go.  Your people, for real, look.  For real, look.  You fuckers.  For real, look.  Fuck you.  Look, you can't even see the nod for yourself.  Does Sean have to go?  Actually, we got to get out of here. 
[03:40:00]  Yeah, we have to go, too.  Oh, good one.  You got a little extra that came over here.  We got her.  It wasn't even a real producer.  Sean.  I'm pointing to it.  So, yeah.  So a couple things.  Role models, on demand.  I loved it.  Thanks, bro.  Sean William Scott was great in it.  And Ice Age 3, of course, which you don't really have to promote.  That's going to just do great business.  Yeah, I think it's pretty fun.  And you're in New York for a while, so come back sooner than later.  Well, the reason why I couldn't come before is because we're shooting crazy nights.  But now I'm off until the end of July.  So if you guys want to go, I'll go with you to set.  Oh, that would be cool. 
[03:40:30]  I'm the actor that actually goes to set because I have nothing else to do, even though I'm  not working.  But we should do that, man.  That'd be awesome.  You're not in the movie anymore.  You're done with the movie.  I just figured I'd come down.  Exactly.  Please do that.  Yeah, let's work.  Your part is so fucking funny, man.  So funny.  I read the whole thing.  Oh, you did?  Oh, dude.  Damn it.  We did a good line.  Thanks, bro.  We improvise so much.  The guy's fucking hilarious.  Yeah.  I think you'll like it.  This is what I do.  This is my number.  Nice.  And if you call and I don't feel like you're, you know, I'm imposing, I'll go down there.  Dude, seriously?  All right.  Let's do it, man. 
[03:41:00]  Kevin would love that, man.  It's good to see you guys.  All right.  We're all ending the show right now.  So we'll see you guys tomorrow.  Ron and Fez in 20 minutes.  Awesome job, too.  Thanks for listening.  Fucking. </pre>
