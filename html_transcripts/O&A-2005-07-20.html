<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with a discussion of their "Assault on the Media" campaign, specifically focusing on Danny's attempts to infiltrate news broadcasts with their "Spread the Vibers" sign, culminating in a physical altercation.  The hosts celebrated this as a success, while simultaneously expressing extreme anger and using highly offensive language towards other radio personalities they believed were copying their campaign, particularly Jim Phillips from Orlando's Real Radio.  They repeatedly provided Phillips' contact information, encouraging listeners to harass him. This "assault" became a recurring theme throughout the broadcast, with numerous listener calls detailing their participation and the retaliatory attacks on the Opie and Anthony show itself.

The hosts also discussed a variety of bizarre news stories: a man found in a woman's outhouse waste tank claiming to search for his wedding ring, a man killed during sex with a horse, and the cultural sensitivities around using racial slurs.  They delved into the scandalous divorce of Barry Williams and the effects of over-the-counter sleep medication.  The show featured multiple listener calls, some discussing their anxieties about losing wedding rings and the potential marital consequences, while others recounted their own participation in the "Assault on the Media," including one listener whose friend lost a finger while wearing his wedding ring.  One caller even jokingly suggested the Maine outhouse incident was inspired by *Schindler's List*.  The hosts also highlighted the power of their fanbase, the "ONA Army," discussing its coordinated online attacks and the fear this inspired in other radio personalities and even themselves.  This was underscored by a brief call from Carlos Mencia, who explained receiving a deluge of emails from ONA Army members after a missed planned appearance on the show.

The show included several segments showcasing listener-generated content. This included a discussion of an inept “Crazy Guy” who attempted to promote the show in Times Square with poorly executed flyers, audio of which was played on air. Another segment involved a listener-created "Pat Battle" internet meme with altered images and Pulp Fiction-inspired quotes, along with a conflict between different groups of listeners producing related content.  The hosts played listener-submitted remixes, and also discussed a "Promote the Show Day" initiative, including a call from someone offering box trucks for advertising.   Further listener-generated content included "Assignment America," encouraging listeners to submit recordings of their children creatively using curse words; one caller provided a live example.

Personal anecdotes and work-related disputes peppered the broadcast.  Anthony detailed his drawn-out battle with Dell customer service, culminating in an email to Michael Dell himself which resulted in a quick resolution.  Opie and Steve, the producer, engaged in a playful argument about Steve's work ethic and the quality of his work compared to Laszlo's.  Jimmy Norton recounted his experience at Ozzfest, and the hosts discussed a show intern who claimed to be related to Thomas Jefferson, speculating on their possible racial heritage.  The hosts also played audio from a fan's interaction with Steve and  an audio clip of Laszlo's radio show intro, highlighting his experiences with his previous, humorless employer and their strict adherence to broadcasting regulations.  Laszlo described being reprimanded for jokes about slashing throats and pedophilia.  This led to a lengthy discussion of FCC regulations and acceptable broadcast language.   The show included a recurring “Whip them out Wednesday” jingle and a Beatles/Guns N' Roses mashup, as well as a new "WOW" remix by Drew Boogie.

The broadcast included several segments on technology and current events. The hosts discussed commercial radio advertising, Opie’s sabotage of a satellite radio advertisement,  MP3 players, new fiber optic internet services, and the ease of accessing information about registered sex offenders online.  A conversation with Laszlo touched on the state of mobile phones, their sound quality, and camera capabilities; Laszlo shared negative experiences with the Samsung Trio phone.  They discussed high-speed internet options, comparing service speeds, and covered several news stories: a hacker who played explicit audio to patients on hold at a medical answering service, a robotic hand for remote breast exams and potential hacking scenarios, a pitch for a Playboy article about robot sex, and a Canadian woman pleading guilty to incest with her two teenage sons.  The show also played a "Bombs and Flubs Volume 2" segment, featuring on-air mistakes and failed jokes. Finally, the show concluded with a discussion about the UN potentially regulating the internet, focusing on concerns from countries like China and Syria. Laszlo's upcoming trip to Alaska for fishing was also mentioned.  Carlos Mencia and Laszlo were both mentioned as appearing or being present in the studio at different points in the show.

[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  To fight the forces of evil.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, my sweet Jesus.  With Op Op.  I want to be known as Notorious.  No.  Act, act.  Everyone is always in my way.  Oh, you really are deluded.  And B-Cup.  Kind of fat-breasted and awful.  And surrounded by dullards.  That looks like poorly spliced film.  Oh, it's hilarious.  I've never seen yawns.  It looks like the back of the Batmobile and it's so nice.  Pauketosis.  Eric, you're not going to cry.  Shut up.  And armed with superhuman powers. 
[00:04:00]  He holds his pants down and just starts leaking into someone's garbage shed.  That's rule one.  How about if he gives you the old chin tap with his helmet?  It's all right with me.  They are living among us.  Average citizens.  Average heroes.  Quietly and anonymously continuing to make the world a better place.  Controversial talkers Opie and Anthony.  We are just mixed.  You better just sit back and watch.  Yeah.  Wait, what?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:04:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  This calls for the old Billy Boo.  Oh, Billy Boo.  Okay, terrific.  Don't, Fred. 
[00:05:00]  Stay out the bushes.  Stay out the bushes.  Don't, Fred.  Don't, Fred.  Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, Fred.  Is that so?  Who made you pull for this stuff, huh?  Hello, Faultface.  Hello, Faultface.  I want to ask you a bunch of questions. 
[00:05:30]  I want to have them answered immediately.  Let's do it!  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  That's a Laszlo clip, and he's coming in to do the program a little later on with us. 
[00:06:00]  We love when Laszlo stops by.  Kind of a tech geek that likes to smoke a lot of pot, so can't go wrong with Laszlo.  I love the tech.  Love the high tech.  Also, at 7.30, Carlos Mencia.  Ooh.  Well.  We should break out that audio from yesterday.  Kind of bitched and complained that Carlos Mencia didn't come by and say hi. 
[00:06:30]  He is a friend.  That's true.  He's a personal friend of mine.  I hung out a little bit during the hiatus, and I was kind of disappointed that he went  on Hoo-Hoo's show and doesn't stop by to say hi.  Hoo-Hoo.  You know, we don't play the game.  If you go on someone else's show, then you don't do our show.  We understand that our friends have to go out and promote, but when you go and do Hoo-Hoo's  show and you don't stop by and see us, that's a real drag if you call yourself a friend.  That's all.  When you're in town, why not? 
[00:07:00]  So I got a really, really nice voicemail from Carlos.  He was apologetic, and he wanted to take me out to dinner and all that stuff, so he's  coming by at 7.30 to say hi.  Some wine on a hilltop watching the sunrise.  That was a sunset.  That was Greg Brady.  He didn't touch me.  I didn't say that.  Let's get that out of the way.  I never even...  Wow.  You were part of that whole dilemma.  I wasn't there.  I had to call you, though, to make sure that it was on the up and up.  Sounded a little odd, that's all. 
[00:07:30]  I didn't want some famous sitcom star hitting on me.  Yeah, it could be awkward, because you'd have to do it.  Yeah, right.  Because he's famous, you know.  Maybe you do it just for the story?  I don't know.  Yeah.  I'm not gay.  I just did it for the story.  Jesus, guys, calm down.  It's Greg Brady, for God's sake.  I have a story that'll last a lifetime.  No, he was married at the time with a little toddler running around.  Yes, he was.  Of course.  We never got to the bottom of that story, huh?  No, his divorce? 
[00:08:00]  They buried that little story.  Yeah, there's something going on there.  Because they looked like they were in love.  I hung out with them a bunch of times and talked to his wife on the phone a bunch of times.  Yeah.  Seemed like a very happy couple.  And then it hit the magazines there, the rag magazines, that they're getting a divorce immediately.  And that she wants supervision when he goes to see their son.  Yeah, which kind of means something.  Something bad happened.  Or at least she's trying to imply that it means something. 
[00:08:30]  I don't know.  Maybe she's playing hardball.  But she doesn't need the money.  She had all the money in that relationship.  Which relationship?  The great Brady.  Yeah.  Barry Williams.  She was like a, she's in like international banking or something.  Yeah, she's loaded.  Because I saw the house at the top of, what the hell, where does Ozzy live?  Hold on, hold on.  Oh, is it going down?  You've got to watch now.  Is it going down?  Is it going down?  Yeah, it should be.  Oh, no.  Oh, no. 
[00:09:00]  All right.  We're cringing, we're cringing, we're cringing.  Where is he?  Where is he?  Uh-oh.  And there we go.  Another assault on the media.  Yeah, it's taking place live on the Opie and Anthony program.  We have an altercation, an altercation.  Is there an altercation in the background?  I saw something.  Our own Danny with the Opie and Anthony Spread the Vibers sign on Channel 11 News live here  in New York City.  What's the altercation?  What's the altercation?  I don't know.  Somebody grabbed his sign and took it away from him. 
[00:09:30]  Let's get Danny on the phone immediately.  Find out what happened there.  Wow.  Very good.  Another assault on the media.  Another successful one.  They can't take his sign.  Of course they can.  Not.  Ridiculous.  Hey, we got some exposure.  There you go.  WB11.  I hope they really roughed him up.  Hope they punched him a few times.  Wow, that's great.  There you go.  Another assault on the media going down.  Hope they beat him until his hair was neat.  Some lame thing they're doing on WB11 News. 
[00:10:00]  They got a bunch of chicks out there and they're running or something down the street.  Hey, we got Danny.  It just went down.  Oh.  Let's see what happened.  Danny.  Hey, what's up, guys?  That was very successful.  Another great assault on the media by Danny.  Danny has done a lot of them, actually.  Yeah.  We send out Danny almost every morning.  We discover a live shot and then, Danny, drop what you're doing and go get your sign.  Danny, what happened? 
[00:10:30]  Oh, well, I guess the person that was producing that shot saw me coming with a sign and she  tried to grab the sign and when that wasn't working, she actually physically put her arm  on me to try and block me from getting into the shot.  Yeah.  So I just broke away from her, got into the shot, and then this other guy came over and  he was, I mean, violently trying to rip it out of my hands.  I don't know if that made it on the air.  Yeah, I saw a little bit of the guy coming over and grabbing your sign.  We saw the...  It was ridiculous.  Do you have the sign still? 
[00:11:00]  Oh, absolutely.  Oh, okay.  Is there any way you can get back into the shot or you don't want to chance it?  No, they'll probably be looking for me now.  Yeah, I get it.  All right.  Yeah, they're on the sidewalk on 57th Street and Madison Avenue, I guess.  Yep.  That was great, though.  We saw the Opie and Anthony spread the virus sign and then Anthony saw some kind of slight  altercation going on.  A little altercation.  And then they moved the shot over to the right.  Yeah, well, I'll have to review the tape.  Very good.  Congrats, Danny.  Good job.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:11:30]  Another great assault on the media.  That's got to be at least 10 for Danny.  At least.  I know.  Danny, he wins in quantity.  He wins in quantity.  Just not quality.  Although that was very good.  But I would have liked to have seen him jumping around right in the middle of everybody.  We need a real buffoon, a real asshole to just get in there.  Like that shot, the ideal thing.  And, you know, I'm real brave talking.  I would never do it myself.  But we need somebody right in the middle to just jump up and down. 
[00:12:00]  And if someone tries to grab the sign, just stay in the shot and try to grab it away from  them.  You know, Danny's a little laid back when it comes to that.  All right.  Very good, though.  Very good.  Great way to start another O.P.  Anthony's show on this fine Whip-Em-Out Wednesday, by the way.  Oh, oh.  It is Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Wow is alive and well.  All you have to do is get a wow on the back of your vehicle.  If you're a trucker, you could just write wow in the dirt on the back of the truck.  Or you could get one of our handy-dandy stickers.  That's right. 
[00:12:30]  Send in a self-addressed stamped envelope and we'll send the stickers out to you immediately.  A lot of people checking in.  Handy from, oh, the WB11 newsroom.  Ha, ha, ha.  Nice, guys.  We got an insider that saw that and then thought it was really funny.  Oh, yeah.  So you send the self-addressed stamped envelopes to us here in New York City.  We send out the wow stickers immediately.  It's 111 West 57th Street, New York, New York.  1-0-0-1-9, I think.  And I believe that address is up on opiumethity.com. 
[00:13:00]  If you don't want to play along with wow, that's okay.  A lot of faithful listeners just have the wows on their car just to show the support for  the show as well, by the way.  Help spread that virus.  But basically, if you do have the wow on your car, there are women out there, lots of  them, that will flash you as you drive.  Oh, yeah.  Okay?  And also, don't forget about rapemywow.com, another website that Steve's running.  Yeah.  Boobage.  Boobage up on himself.  Whore.  It's getting a lot of new wow shots.  God, I think I'll wake up by 8 o'clock, by the way. 
[00:13:30]  What's the problem?  Did you sleep last night?  Well, I think I dehydrated myself a little bit because I was skating in the park and  stuff.  It was only, what, 90?  Wasn't it like 100 degrees out yesterday?  Yeah, it was about 95.  Yeah, that's great.  You know how much water you can lose in 40 minutes in the park?  Not if you're sitting in an air-conditioned living room drinking water.  So it was time for beddy-bye, and I have one of those headaches.  A little headache.  I'm like, I need a good night's sleep because the night before I didn't get a good night's 
[00:14:00]  sleep, so I went into the medicine cabinet.  There is stuff out there that just should not be legal.  It's great.  Over-the-counter stuff?  The over-the-counter stuff is just amazing.  How are they getting away with this crap?  Some good crap, man.  When we were growing up, you had, like, the NyQuil, but now, man, they got so much stuff  to just knock you the F out.  What did you take?  Tylenol PM.  I've heard about that, yeah.  I'm like, headache, a little achy, and I need a good night's sleep.  I'm going right for the Tylenol PM. 
[00:14:30]  I took one, dude.  That'll knock you out.  You're supposed to take two, but I was smart enough, because I think the last time I was  in a slight coma when I woke up, so I'm like, all right, I'll just take one.  So now you're all sleepy?  Holy crap, when the alarm went off this morning, I didn't even know where I was.  And then I'm like, I thought I just went to bed.  But I just went to bed.  You ever get that feeling?  It's very rare.  You fall asleep, and then the alarm is like, boom.  Yeah, you sleep so heavy right through the whole night.  That it feels like you've been asleep for 10 minutes.  That sucks. 
[00:15:00]  And then I just staggered around my apartment for like 40 minutes, and then finally came  to work.  Obviously, it was late, because I was moving in slow motion today.  Yeah.  I feel a lot better now, but...  Well, you're drinking your Starbucks.  Yeah, that'll...  Your caffeine.  That'll wake me up, so...  But the stuff they got, it's ridiculous.  The cold medication is what screws me up.  So I rarely ever take it.  I had my cold last week.  I didn't take anything.  Because it just, it knocks me out. 
[00:15:30]  And not even knocks me out where I go to sleep.  It makes me so like, like woozy.  Like you feel like you have a high fever.  You get that feeling.  Yeah.  Where you move your eyes around back and forth, and you're all kind of in a daze.  Where you got tracers?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It can't function.  You're not supposed to get tracers from cold medicine.  Cannot function like that.  Maybe if you drop acid or something, but...  Yeah.  But tracers from cold medicine?  No.  I always liked the NyQuil. 
[00:16:00]  That stuff's pretty good.  But that just knocks you out.  You go to sleep.  It takes care of the cold.  Right.  We got some audio of a radio scumbag.  Who?  I was just, uh...  Bruce Kelly?  Nah, we like Bruce.  Of course we do.  He gets it.  He knows how to play.  This giant hog in his sweatpants.  Is that picture up on any website yet?  I have to...  You gotta send that over to, uh...  Too busy greedily enjoying it myself.  Yes.  You pop that picture up every so often on the camera and just look at it? 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  Let's say...  Let's say hi to John in Connecticut.  John!  Yo, what's up, boys?  Hey, man.  How you doing?  All right.  Yo, you're talking about that Tylenol PM shit?  Yeah.  I never see my father.  I see him, like, once in a fucking blue moon.  Yeah.  What happened there?  John!  He...  Did his phone cut out?  Or did he hang up?  I have no idea.  So, anyway, we've been doing this Assault on the Media. 
[00:17:00]  It's a pretty creative thing, you know, that we've just taken to a nice level, right?  It's easy.  It spreads the name of the show around on national television.  I mean, why wouldn't you want to do this?  Right.  And we're having a contest every month.  You know, the best Assault on the Media wins at MiFi.  And a day in the studio with the show.  That's the prizes for July.  And then August, I think we're going to get even better prizes, okay?  Better prizes.  I think so, yeah.  It's something we're going to continue doing. 
[00:17:30]  And this goes way back.  We got a girl to flash on the Today Show with our WOW stickers on her chest.  That was a huge, huge one.  We've had a lot of huge...  Lots of huge assaults on the media, right?  Yeah.  And then, I guess, one of our biggest ones was when that stupid reporter, Arthur Chien,  turned around in the middle of the assault on the media and said,  What the fuck is your problem, man?  Yeah.  And it just exploded.  That video is all over the world.  You know, we got exposure in all the New York papers and a bunch of other papers across America.  And Eric Logan Elo, he said it. 
[00:18:00]  He called us and was congratulating us on the idea and how creative it is and blah, blah, blah.  He goes, But the problem is, you know this business.  This is going to be the hottest thing to do in radio this summer.  People are going to just jump on it.  He goes, You understand that, right?  And I'm like, No.  Come on.  No.  And sure enough, you know, stations are starting to do this and try to make it their own.  Tell them, Fred.  I hate, hate these fucking guys on radio. 
[00:18:30]  I hate them.  There was a guy, Tonelli.  I forgot the name of his show.  He's in the, uh, he's in, uh, you know, San Francisco area, I guess.  Yeah.  Bay Area.  When we, uh, did the whole WOW thing, he, he just, just took the whole fucking promotion  and made it like it was his idea and his own thing.  The WOW stickers were exactly the same.  Yeah, he took the logo and everything.  And, and just like, he has no pride.  All of a sudden he just, he just takes the WOW concept, makes it kind of big in his area 
[00:19:00]  because he has a big show.  No one knows where the damn idea came from originally.  And then when that Today Show flashing happened, he's all over his show claiming that, you know,  it was one of his people that happened to be in New York and stuff.  Fucking just a bunch of scumbags in this business.  That's what they are.  Thieves.  So sure enough, um, Eric Logan was right.  We got a show in Orlando that is, um, attempting to do their own take on the assault on the media already.  Tempting.  Oh, shit. 
[00:19:30]  I did not just say that.  Wow, it's one word.  That's all I said.  Huh?  I just said one word.  I know, but I know where this leads.  No.  You're saying that the, the assault on the media, which is obviously an Opie and Anthony thing,  you're saying that outside parties.  Were attempting to call this their own, those parties need to be corrected.  Any other personalities that attempt to do this promotion must also be corrected. 
[00:20:00]  I can't roll my R's like that.  No?  Cranked.  I'd do Grady all day if I could.  All right.  Thank you.  Ah, well, that only took 20 minutes.  That was 20 minutes.  Come on.  Please just start the show tomorrow with the shining thing so we can, so we can actually,  so we can actually, yeah, so we can actually do a real radio show.  When do you think maybe we should do an assault on the media? 
[00:20:30]  Soon as possible.  Let's say hi to Brian in Baltimore.  Brian, what's up?  I just call and say that the two clowns on the radio show there are doing the same promotion  you guys are doing.  The assault on the media?  Yeah, giving away prizes and stuff.  See, Elo was 100% correct, man.  He said this would be taken by everybody in America.  Yeah. 
[00:21:00]  And these guys have no pride.  They're no fucking, fuck, they're just a bunch of scumbags.  Have some pride.  What's the name of the show that's doing it down there?  Big O and Duke.  Big O and Duke.  Having fun with the assault on the media thing.  Yep.  Big O and Duke.  And a lot of these guys will do it and just, you know, call it the same fucking thing,  too.  Yeah.  So, I guess we got audio of a show in Orlando.  Really?  Yeah, listen to this.  Green or something.  No.  Fair way.  No.  Here's Chuck on real radio. 
[00:21:30]  Chuck.  Hi.  Another one of these fucking guys with the voice.  Hey, here's Chuck on real radio.  I'm going to try this out as real as possible with this fake voice.  How you doing?  Hey, Chuck.  Yeek.  What's the name of the show again in Orlando?  I don't know.  I really don't.  Yeah.  Hi.  How you doing?  Okay.  The reason I'm calling is I've noticed on Fox News and on CNN, one of the big things 
[00:22:00]  lately is they all have windows behind them.  Right.  And, you know, people are always on their cell phones calling home and waving and everything.  Well, I thought it would be a good idea to send Tuttle up there with a car road mask and have  him stand behind Fox News giving a thumbs up and cheering him on.  It's not a bad idea.  We're about ready to do that newsbreakers thing.  This is where these goofs show up at local news stories and stand behind the reporter  doing a live report from out in the field just because so much of this stuff is just 
[00:22:30]  corny, cornball, you know.  Doesn't apply to anybody.  Oh, my God.  This is our fucking break that we did like a month ago.  Come on.  This is the, it's Jim Phillips?  This isn't even a tell-em, Fred.  This is legit.  Come on now.  Oh.  Big O and Duke handout.  Oh, Big O and Duke are the guys that hand out the O and A wows.  They're actually fans of the show.  Oh, that's why the name didn't ring true.  Those guys are the Baltimore.  Yeah, they're fans.  Wait, have them call the show.  What are they doing, though?  Are they doing the assault on the media thing? 
[00:23:00]  And if they are, they got to like...  But let's not confuse.  Now, everyone's going to get confused.  What you were just hearing was not Big O and Duke.  No.  This is a guy in Orlando.  Yeah.  People are going to get confused and think they're doing the assault on the media.  Newsbreakers, they call it.  Opie, newsbreakers.  Because they, I guess, break in on the news.  It doesn't apply to anybody.  Exactly.  Nonsense.  So what I have to do is clear with...  I'm going to have to inform management that this is what I would like to do.  Number one, so I own it. 
[00:23:30]  Uh-huh.  So nobody can rip me off.  Oh, my God!  You fucking cunt!  Oh.  So I own it.  So no...  You're a little too late there, my friend.  You...  This is what fucking happens in radio every single fucking day.  This is radio.  Right here.  This is the world we live in.  Right here.  So I can own it.  You dick. 
[00:24:00]  This is Jim Phillips.  You nerd!  Jim Phillips has been doing this, like, talk radio in Orlando forever and really hasn't made a name for himself.  What's his number?  888-978-1041.  He's on in the afternoon.  Hey, there you go.  3 to 7 p.m.  Attack.  Give it out a little slower, the number.  888-978-1041.  Let her rip.  Listen to this scumbag.  Doesn't apply to anybody.  Exactly.  Nonsense.  So what I have to do is clear with... 
[00:24:30]  I'm going to have to inform management that this is what I would like to do.  Number one, so I own it.  So nobody can rip me off.  He's kidding, right?  We've got national exposure out of this.  It's already...  Yeah, we've already gotten one of these idiots fired.  We've gotten national exposure over this.  Yeah, and we've been in the papers on the news.  And then another pussy that's not actually real.  He's got to go clear with management and stuff.  Yeah, have fun. 
[00:25:00]  Well, you can rip me off.  I don't care.  But I want to be the first to do it.  And number two, I want...  This is not happening, right?  This is not happening.  Oh, dear Lord.  Jesus, this ain't happening, man.  This can't be happening, man.  This ain't happening.  Oh, Bob Kelly audio.  Well, that's great.  This is fucking great, man.  Now, what the fuck are we supposed to do?  There's some real pretty shit now, man. 
[00:25:30]  Exactly.  This is not happening.  Body, nonsense.  So what I have to do is clear with...  I'm going to have to inform management that this is what I would like to do, number one,  so I own it, so nobody can rip me off.  Well, you can rip me off.  I don't care.  But I want to be the first to do it.  And number two, I want them to know what I want to do.  And they may raise some objections, but do it anyway. 
[00:26:00]  They can do it anyway.  So they can understand where you got the idea.  Exactly.  I have a couple of articles on it.  We've talked about it on the program.  Talk to the guy.  We talked to one of the newsbreakers.  And our idea to start off with is to get Tuttle.  Get in some, you know, regular satin boxing shorts.  I mean, the real deal.  Maybe, you know, one of those fancy cups.  You know, we get in some boxing shoes or whatever you call them.  Those booties.  Yeah, we can find those.  We'll get them.  He's talking about, there was an article on newsbreakers in the New York Times.  It's a little local bunch of guys in Rochester that sort of do the same thing. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  But it kind of started at the same time.  Not even at the same time.  We started this way before the newsbreakers hit the media with this thing.  Like I said, we go way back to getting, you know, our signs on the Today Show  and the girl flashing with the WOW stickers and stuff.  Right.  Then there was this little side thing that started with these guys, the newsbreakers,  that get goofy on local newscasts.  And they were mentioned and we were mentioned in the same New York Times article. 
[00:27:00]  This guy knows damn well that we've been doing this.  So I own it.  You can kind of hear the guilt in his voice.  Run it past the boss.  Even if he says, no, I'm just such a rebel.  I'm going to do it.  You can hear the guilt in his voice because he knows that we're going to call him out on it.  Cups.  You know, we get him some boxing shoes or whatever you call them.  Yeah, we can find those.  We'll get him some big gloves.  You know, the big fat ones.  Like big kangaroos.  And then put a towel around his neck.  And what we'll have him do is show up at some of these live news reports that they're doing out of the field, 
[00:27:30]  especially some of this innocuous, ridiculous junk that they're reporting from.  And we'll just have him.  Oh, this is this.  Stop.  Isn't that what?  What are they going to have him do?  This is getting funny.  The outfit's kind of funny, though, the boxing outfit.  Dude, why bother being creative on the radio when all, you know, you know this shit's going to be taken by a million other people.  And then no one knows where it comes from.  This is the exact break we did months ago.  Months ago.  Some of this innocuous, ridiculous junk that they're reporting from. 
[00:28:00]  And we'll just have him.  Plus the fact this guy is on XM.  So he obviously has XM.  And he probably listens to our show.  He can't stand behind the reporter as they're doing the report shadowboxing.  With no one.  Just doing right there.  Yeah, we might have something.  Yeah, just shadowboxing.  Just, you know, punk to the hook.  Punk to the shadowboxing.  Shut up.  Shut up.  And, you know, might have something on the gloves.  I don't know.  A word like. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, well, it's not going to be a self-promotion for the program or the radio station.  But it might, you know.  What was it?  Fight truth or fight?  Yeah.  Get real.  You know, he's got every right to be there.  If there's no, you know, you can't, you can't, well, you can shoo him away all you want.  But as long as he's not touching anybody, it's a matter of fact he can get in front of the reporter if he wants to.  Oh, God, this guy.  But as long as he's not touching equipment or touching a reporter, touching a cameraman, he can do whatever he damn well pleases. 
[00:29:00]  No pride.  I can't wait.  I am hoping, I am hoping I can get the blessing of management.  Because, you know, it's all about press.  It's all about, and, you know.  And we'll figure out where they are.  I know for sure this morning we would have had no trouble because they were at some ridiculous, well, I mean, sad, somebody was killed, whatever.  Ah, ridiculous.  It had no impact on anybody, and at 6 o'clock in the morning, all three stations were there, like it was the biggest deal.  And it was, they didn't have anything to show in the background.  And if they're there in the morning, there's a very good chance, of course, they're going to be there for the noon. 
[00:29:30]  So we'll be able to tell.  They're going to be there at noon as well.  Or if it's a big story at noon, we know that they're going to have a live shot.  Well, you know, we can determine for ourselves if we want to, but we think it's legitimate news.  But most of the stuff, when they're out in the field, is just stupid stuff.  It's just ridiculous.  And it happened 10 hours before, and they're still out there.  So we'll get Tuttle out there.  We'll put a towel around his neck, and he just got in shadow box. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, exactly.  The big mouthpiece up there.  It's the Phillips File on Real Radio 104.1.  What a dick.  Just nail this guy.  What a fucking dick.  Nail this guy to the wall.  Hey, Jim Phillips, you obviously listen to the Opie and Anthony show every day on your XM, huh?  Cocksucker.  Do they have a website anywhere?  There's got to be a website, too, that maybe people go post on.  Dudes, you know, call out the Army and don't let up.  Don't make this a day thing.  Just keep pounding him and pounding him and pounding him and pounding him until he calls our bosses 
[00:30:30]  behind the scenes like they all do and try to make us stop.  This is top priority, troops.  What a fucking scumbag.  Give out that number one more time so everyone's got it.  It's 888-978-1041.  He's on from 3 to 7 p.m.  3 to 7 Eastern?  He's a douchebag.  Is it Eastern time, 3 to 7?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, just let it rip.  He's a douchebag.  Wait, Eric, it's WTKS.com. 
[00:31:00]  Now, is his site his message board or site there?  Everything's right there.  Everything's there, WTKS.com.  Jim Phillips.  There you go.  And the hole working with him.  Jesus, shut the fuck up.  You have nothing interesting to say.  Another nothing to contribute hole.  You have nothing to contribute.  Will you shut the fuck up?  He should put you in a dunking booth like Howard does.  Ugh.  What a douche.  That's the same station as Shannon Burke. 
[00:31:30]  Remember that douche?  Ah, real radio.  And it wasn't the monsters of the midday.  Or they're now in the morning.  What are they doing?  What are they?  They just call themselves the monsters now.  I don't know.  We don't know where they are.  Monsters of overnight.  Well, we got reports yesterday that it was the monsters doing the assault on the media.  But it's this Jim Phillips douchebag.  Yeah.  And he could hear in his voice.  You could hear the guilt.  You could hear the guilt.  He knows where the idea came from.  He can't commit to owning it.  And he was trying to cover his ass.  Yeah.  No one rips me off.  He's got to say that a little too much, you know? 
[00:32:00]  A little too much.  Because he knows.  What a...  God, just...  Just like Elo said.  Yep.  So this bit will pop up all over the country now because of you guys.  Just like Elo said.  A little off the top.  Oops.  What?  Oh, God.  I got a question, though.  Yeah.  I'm a little worried.  Why?  Are you guys going to fire me and hire Tuttle?  Well, you know, I don't see you getting in boxing shorts. 
[00:32:30]  It's a funny bitch.  And shadow boxing.  I just don't see it.  Big gloves.  Big gloves.  Little Jimmy's in there throwing out some jabs.  Maybe something written on the gloves.  I don't know.  Here's something cute about the Jim Phillips show.  The female is Italian playing a New York Jew.  Oh, really?  Ew.  Is that it?  Playing a part?  She's just a hole that has nothing to contribute.  Nothing.  Ah, let's not go down that road.  Oh, now.  Let's slow down, Jim.  Skirt.  Dude, does that audio go right through you? 
[00:33:00]  It's this exact same break we've been doing over and over again.  It is.  Just stop.  All right.  Carlos Mencia.  Get Carlos in here.  He's got to leave by 8 o'clock.  Oh, he does?  Yes.  Carlos wants to stop by and say hi.  Carlos.  Sorry, we got off on a little rant this morning.  How did you get all pissed off?  You fucking cunt.  You cunt.  Hey, it's satellite radio.  You might as well take advantage of it sometimes, man.  Who are you talking about? 
[00:33:30]  This fucking guy that does a talk show in Orlando, Jim Phillips,  decided to take one of our very unique bits and make believe that he just came up with the idea on the spot.  Yeah.  We understand.  We understand the creative process.  We understand sometimes it's, you know, people are doing the same thing.  And you know what I mean?  But there are times that it's so obvious that it's something that somebody started.  And then to just go and make believe that someone else didn't do it before you is just ridiculous.  It's ridiculous. 
[00:34:00]  We love the blatant self-promotion of our show.  So we have freaks grab signs that say Opie and Anthony on them and get behind the live shots for the news cameras.  We've been doing this for years.  All over the country.  We have a lot of listeners doing this.  We've been having guys dress up in, like, costumes, like Gumby costumes and what have you.  The Gorilla.  The Battle.  We had a girl, Wow, on the Today Show about four or five years ago with Wow stickers on her chest.  And, you know, and then we got a reporter fired recently because we're in the middle of doing one. 
[00:34:30]  And it was very tame.  He was at the top of the subway steps doing a report on the subways.  And all of a sudden he heard, you know, someone behind him with a sign screaming Opie and Anthony.  So he turns around and goes, what the fuck is your problem, man?  Well, that guy was, I didn't know that.  I heard about that guy.  Yeah, that was part of our show.  Got fired.  And that got us pretty much international, not pretty much, it did.  It got us international attention.  That story went everywhere.  And our big boss goes, you know, congratulations for the exposure, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:35:00]  It's a great bit.  But I want to, you know, prepare you.  You know every radio guy now is going to steal this bit this summer.  And sure enough, the first one has come in from this guy in Orlando.  And, you know, whatever.  But he is just shameless with it.  And he's saying how he's got to check with the boss and get this all, you know,  in place quickly so nobody rips him off.  He says, no way.  He's already acting like it's his?  Yeah.  That's hilarious.  It's just disheartening.  You know, I guess it's in any business, especially things like comedy and anything creative. 
[00:35:30]  You're going to get that crap.  Are we taping Channel 11?  Why are they filming a shitter?  I'll tell you.  What?  Because it's a story we did on this show.  Did we just tape Channel 11?  Was it the guy that was in there?  Did you hear about the guy and the shitter?  No.  This is one of the best news stories to hit in, I don't know, the last, like, ten years.  What happened?  Good one.  This guy got caught hanging out in, you know, like, you know those porta-potties?  Yeah.  But they're really nice, like, I guess you see them at campsites and stuff, and it's 
[00:36:00]  an actual toilet, but, you know, there's no plumbing, you just shit into a hole or whatever.  Yeah, a big hole.  And it has, like, kind of an outhouse around it.  But it's a nice hole.  Yeah, it's nice and stuff.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  This guy, like, somehow got down in with the shit and was hanging out there.  His girls were taking dumps to take a look, and he got caught.  That's a commitment to looking at Gash.  That really is, like, that guy.  On a level that I could never understand.  That guy just needs to see pussy. 
[00:36:30]  And when the story broke, when you do, like, morning radio or whatever, there are stories  that break, and you're like, all right, come on, that's got to be fake.  And a lot of times they are fake, right?  Right.  This one turns out to be as real as it could be.  The guy was caught hanging out, and we're trying to figure out how he got down there.  We think he actually had to go through the toilet.  He had to.  Because those toilets are sometimes very big when you lift the seat up.  But, you know, we're in a day and age where electronics are very small and very affordable  and can be planted anywhere. 
[00:37:00]  Right?  Instead of putting your own head in there, why not just get a camera from Radio Shack,  a little wireless camera?  You can hang out by your car and just look at as much ass on the toilet as you want.  And have proof for your friends.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  You can snap off pictures of it and shit, of course.  Yeah.  This guy's putting his body in a shit vat.  He's a shit freak.  Don't kid yourself.  There's no way that that guy's in all that stuff and he's not a shit freak.  You don't just do that to see ass and pussy.  I don't think you do.  I don't even think it had anything to do with ass and pussy. 
[00:37:30]  No.  You think you just wanted to be...  I think that was all.  I was trying to look at pussy.  I think he was in a shit.  He was like...  Nice hot chick sits down on the pole and you're like,  Hey, get out of here.  Leave me alone.  Exactly.  Just wallowing in this shit.  Come on.  What guy?  Seriously.  I've done a lot of crazy shit for...  Who would jump in a batter of shit?  Right.  Nobody.  Well, we're thinking that it was a batter of shit.  Maybe it was a new hole and there's just a few little piles so far. 
[00:38:00]  I don't care if it was brand new and no one had been in there yet.  It's just somebody's going to come in and take a shit.  You're going to be in there.  And how could you...  I don't know.  How could you withstand the smell?  Because he was into that.  I'm telling you.  They put everything together.  That guy was a shit...  He was a shit freak.  You got to be.  You can't jump in there without that.  That's the first thing that came out of his...  What the fuck are you doing down there?  Oh, look at the pussy.  You know what I mean?  That's what happened.  Yeah.  There's no way, dude.  This guy was in there... 
[00:38:30]  He was in there for other reasons, dude.  Well, there's an...  They just did an update.  That's why.  When they showed that outhouse, it was obvious it has to be that story.  I would guess, but who knows.  And then, although...  You know, I think that maybe the animal farm might be even better than the shitter story  now.  That's a good one, too.  We've still...  We haven't gotten too deep into that story yet.  What's the animal farm?  Yeah.  You hear about that guy?  He got killed having sex with a horse.  Oh, yeah.  I heard about that.  In Seattle?  He was there.  And we thought perhaps he was behind the horse having sex with it. 
[00:39:00]  That's what I thought.  He kicked him.  No.  This guy was under the horse, getting fucked by it.  And the horse fell on top of him?  No.  It ripped up his insides.  Good.  You ever see the size of a horse?  Yes, of course.  I lived on a farm for a while.  Cute.  Yeah.  Who would fuck...  If you were a horse, I wouldn't fuck a horse.  Yeah.  This guy just bent over underneath, let the horse drive it home, and I don't know, what  did it... hit like his liver or something?  Yeah, it just destroyed his colon or I don't know.  Perforated colon, he died.  That's right.  That's what it was.  And then it turns out that this farm was used for that. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah, I heard about that, that like they had some site that said, come if you want  to bone an animal or something.  Yeah.  Like a happy little farm.  You go down there and just fuck a chicken.  You think they hand you a menu or something?  Would you like a chicken or...  Yeah.  Oh, dude.  That's disgusting, man.  Try the beef today.  I hear it's good.  Little menu with your options, you know.  You walk around and go, now sheep is the preferred.  It looks like pussy.  They say...  By they, I mean me. 
[00:40:00]  Today's special.  Yeah, what's on the special menu?  Rooster ass.  You hear those rumors all the time that they snap the chicken's neck right when they're  ready to come.  Well, then the chicken starts, yeah, it starts shaking, convulsing.  See, that sucks, dude.  You're going to fuck a chicken, then you're going to kill it.  That's not right, man.  That's just not right, dude.  We just had enough for the chicken that you're fucking it. 
[00:40:30]  Fuck it, then we'll just walk around to shame for the rest of this life.  Exactly, dude.  Exactly.  Let it go to therapy.  There's recovering.  There's recovering, dude.  You don't just fuck it and kill it, man.  Well, it shakes.  So how about you shake it when you come?  What about that?  The poor animal, man.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  You doing ESPN after this?  Cold pizza.  Oh, cold pizza.  What is that?  That's like the ESPN morning show.  Oh, cool.  Is that Kane involved with that one?  Kane was involved. 
[00:41:00]  I don't know if he's still doing it.  And then the chick from Road Rules.  Which one?  One of the first Road Rules.  Cat or something?  Oh, I remember her.  She's actually hot.  She's a bad man.  She's a cute little, I don't know, what do you call them?  What do you call them?  I don't know.  I'll be short and cute.  Start with an N.  Slightly chubby.  Does it?  I don't know what you're talking about.  Actually, I think she's Irish.  Is it those people?  She's a cute little one of them. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  What were you saying?  She's like, ah, what is the word?  A pixie.  Oh.  She's like, you know, a pixie.  They're kind of cute.  Like little petite?  Not petite, short.  Was she a...  She wasn't the Australian one, right?  The Australian broad?  Yeah, from Road Rules.  No, she's like black Irish, man.  Really?  That's what I'm going with.  I knew there was black in there.  Yeah.  The way he was beating around the bush and not really getting to the point.  It's satellite radio.  Let it out. 
[00:42:00]  His white guilt just stacked up.  He's got those big Irish eyes, you know.  Black hair.  That's like that bit.  I forgot what show it was on, but they were trying to describe some guy around the office  and wouldn't just say, it's the black guy.  Right.  You know, the guy who wears glasses.  Right.  Yeah, the smart guy, the guy that...  And it would be so easy to just go, it's the black guy.  But nobody wanted to say it.  You don't want to say it like that.  Why not?  It's the black guy.  Ah, you can't because you can't because you're white.  If you're white, you can't just say that because then it kind of lets people know that 
[00:42:30]  that's the only way you see him.  The best way to describe him is the first thing that...  And you shouldn't be seeing him as a black guy.  You should be walking around and just seeing him.  It shouldn't enter your mind to think, oh, the black guy.  You should be like, oh, the hard worker guy.  You know, the guy that brought the reports in a day early.  I would have been like the guy with the big cock.  That guy?  The one who likes chicken?  Is that the guy you're talking about?  Oh, the one with a lantern in his hand.  Yeah. 
[00:43:00]  Jesus.  We're always a mess like that.  The guy that brings a thermos filled with red Kool-Aid?  Yeah, of course.  I know that guy.  You just can't talk like that anymore.  I don't know.  Well, you know what?  We did a thing on the show where we went and asked black people what's the difference  between the word nigga and nigger.  And basically there is a difference, but white people can't say either of them, period,  end of story, no matter what.  Yeah.  Well, those are the rules that have been laid down.  Yeah, which is funny because you ask black guys, you know, what's nigger? 
[00:43:30]  And they're like, it's just a friend.  It don't mean anything bad.  Yeah.  Can white people say it?  Absolutely not.  No.  Period, end of story.  Yeah, but the people that it's, that's the odd thing, is the people that the word is,  they get hardest hit by it.  They can't make up the rules for who's using it or not.  Right.  You can't make up, if it, if it, if it, if it's you, if the word is being used against  you, you can't all of a sudden say, you can't use that word. 
[00:44:00]  Right.  Well, but the thing is, but now we got to use it driving by very quickly in our cars  with the window down for a second.  But the funny part was I, like, interviewed people that was like, look, 85% of rap is  purchased by white people.  Yeah.  And about 95% of rap has that word in it.  Yeah.  And they sing it, and they're like, they can buy our albums, but they can't fucking sing  it.  Not around us.  Period, end of story.  I was like, that's gotta suck to be white, dude.  That's the bit you gotta do for Comedy Central.  You gotta get a nice ride with a white kid, cranking up the rap songs, and just singing 
[00:44:30]  along really loud in a ghetto.  What we did was we had these really old guys, who have no idea what rap is, reading the actual  lyrics of some of the songs.  That's pretty funny.  So we got an old, old ass guy going, my niggas, niggas, yay, yay, niggas, dude, it's  the funniest shit ever, dude.  And they have no idea what they're doing.  Can we get a clip of that?  We'll play it on our show.  We haven't actually...  Oh, you haven't aired it yet?  No, no, no, no, but I'll send it to you guys.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Send it to us, and it'll be a nice promotion for the show, because that sounds like... 
[00:45:00]  Oh, dude, it's so funny, man.  That sounds like something I'd like to hear, old guys.  It's so funny, bro.  How they treating you over there, Comedy Central?  Dude, Comedy Central's cool, but they have lawyers, and the lawyers are the ones that  serve as censors, because it's not about the FCC, it's about who's going to sue on.  Right, right.  See?  It's not even about just federal regulations anymore.  No.  So, horrible.  Those guys.  Horrible.  The standards and practices.  Lawyers are so good with comedy.  Unbelievable. 
[00:45:30]  Assholes.  You don't have to tell us, man.  This week...  Oh, check this out.  Tonight, we bring back the ghost of Johnny Cochran in some piece that we do, and I talk  to him, and I ask him a question, and he's like, I'm just an old nigga that died.  And, dude, those lawyers ran out.  I mean, literally ran out and went, he can't say that.  And I was like, I didn't tell him to say that.  And he's like, no, I'm black.  I can say it.  They're like, no.  What was their reasoning?  They were like, that's offensive.  And he's like, I'm black.  So?  But he said, I'm black. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  It's not offensive to me.  They're like, no, it's offensive to black people.  He's like, it's offensive if you say it, but it ain't offensive if I say it.  And she's like, well, you can't say nigger.  And he's like, I didn't say nigger.  I said nigger.  That's different.  She's like, no, it's not.  And he goes, bitch, how the fuck are you going to tell me I'm black?  What's offensive to me and what two words are when I invented the fucking word?  Well, that's exactly it.  They know what's offensive.  You're not smart enough to realize what's offensive to you.  So we can tell you what's offensive.  And it's funny because that's what I said.  I said, you know, you're being a fucking racist. 
[00:46:30]  Right.  And she's like, no, I'm not.  And I'm like, yeah, you are.  You're telling the black man he's too stupid to figure out what's offensive to him.  That's how they operate.  So you've got to be, and she's like, well, I mean, I just, you can't say it.  So that's when I said, all right, I've got to go out and do nigger nigger because this is ridiculous.  We have to say this word on the show.  Yeah.  Stupid.  It's stupid.  You should have Johnny Cochran come out.  You lift a lid.  You lift the top of his skull up and eat pudding out of his head.  I do believe for the end. 
[00:47:00]  Lawyers are ruining it for everybody.  I'm telling you.  We lived this game.  Oh, yeah.  They would always come at us with, you know, what we couldn't do.  And the reasoning was ridiculous if there ever was reasoning.  Yeah.  It used to be just adhere to FCC regulations and that's it.  If someone's offended, fuck them.  That's what this is all about.  Now they're so afraid of interest groups and boycotts.  They're afraid of PETA.  Yeah, PETA.  They're afraid of PETA.  Who's afraid?  Why are you giving these guys any credibility? 
[00:47:30]  By not doing things to not upset PETA, you're giving PETA credibility and giving them power  that they're now going to use on someone else.  We were going to do a CSI, like a fake CSI.  It was going to be a CSI Korea where there was going to be a dead body and the guy had  been mauled but we couldn't tell what animal it was.  And then the guy, like, takes a bite of a piece of the animal that was there and he  goes, oh, yeah, that's a German Shepherd or whatever.  And he's an Asian guy and it was going to be CSI Korea.  They're like, you can't do those.  No, can't do that joke. 
[00:48:00]  Are you kidding me?  What a nightmare.  What?  The guy's Korean and he's telling her, no, no, no, we eat dog and this is what we call  it, ching chow or whatever.  Right.  And I was like, she's like, well, but you can't talk about eating dogs.  And he's like, but this is in Korea and they eat dogs in Korea.  Yeah.  And they're like, well, PETA.  Well, then fucking PETA should go to Korea and do their shit over there instead of telling  us not to do the jokes.  The lawyers just need to stay out of comedy.  It's ridiculous.  It sucks, dude.  It's horrible.  I mean, we get away with a lot of shit. 
[00:48:30]  Don't get me wrong, but we got to fight a lot of it.  Yep.  And it's all the lawyers.  And the funny thing is we fought every day with our every day.  And there were bits we had.  We knew were home runs.  Sometimes you just know you're in the zone.  You're like, this is such a home run.  It's not even funny.  And then all of a sudden the lawyers get involved and it's like, oh, my God.  Are you fucking kidding me?  Next thing you know, they take some of your best material away from you.  And then as a creative person and doing a show like this, you're like, oh, shit.  Now, well, now we have to do this bit that we don't want to commit to. 
[00:49:00]  It's half-assed and it's gay.  Yeah.  Because people are asking us, you know, will you guys ever go back to commercial radio?  I don't really see how that's possible now.  Now that we have this freedom.  We don't freaking talk to lawyers anymore.  We had a lawyer that signed the contract and watched us sign the contract.  That's the last time I've seen her.  She doesn't call.  Nothing.  And on commercial radio, it was just constant letters from lawyers and trading emails and  read this because you're too stupid to figure it out by yourself. 
[00:49:30]  Unbelievable.  We can't even say homo.  Can't say homo.  Right.  And I was like, homo is short for homosexual.  Yeah.  We're not even talking about like, all right, I understand the fags.  I understand.  They're so scared of offending gay people.  They're like, don't say homo.  So then what I did was I went on stage and I said, I can't do jokes about gay people.  But the way I look at it, you can take a penis, you can take a joke.  And that was my way of getting the joke in.  Yeah.  So I got it in anyway.  But still, it's like, I can't say homo.  You've got to be kidding me.  You can't say fag or faggot, even if it's in terms of, you know, you're calling your 
[00:50:00]  friend, you know, who's wimping out on doing something.  Don't be a faggot.  Yes.  You can't say that.  Can't.  Cannot.  They didn't even want us to bring back the ghost of Johnny Cochran.  And I was like, you've got to be kidding me.  You're going to upset Johnny Cochran?  Who's going to get upset?  OJ?  The black people are going to get upset.  And I was like, why the fuck are they going to get upset?  It's a joke.  It's a fake fucking guy.  He's going to come in and tell rhymes.  He's going to rhyme about court cases.  Yeah.  You've got to be kidding.  I'm like, fuck that.  We're doing it. 
[00:50:30]  I don't, I don't care.  There's, I don't give a shit.  So we brought him out.  And since Chappelle is gone, are you guys like, I mean, you guys are like, now that  fucked us.  See, everybody thinks that that was a good thing.  That fucked us.  It fucked us hard, dude.  Did it?  Fuck yeah.  Big time.  How's that?  Well, I mean, when they first came, when we first came up with the concept of the show,  they were like, man, this is funny.  And you know what?  Even beyond that, we have a perfect place for it.  Right after Chappelle, we have no real ethnic comedies on this show.  Well, you, right after Chappelle, would be awesome. 
[00:51:00]  And we'll, like, Chappelle premieres on Tuesdays, but then repeats on Thursdays.  So we were going to go on after the repeat of the first episode on Thursday, which got  like a three rating, whereas to right now, we're following a rating of a 1.4.  Do you know what I'm saying?  Bonus, dude.  Hard.  We were the third best rated premiere in the history of the network.  But if we would have followed Chappelle, we would have destroyed that.  Yeah.  It would have been a nice lead-in.  A big lead-in.  What's the lead-in for you? 
[00:51:30]  South Park.  But repeats of reruns.  Yeah.  You know what I'm saying?  Not even, like, original show.  First run.  Yeah, nothing like that.  And South Park has seen better days, obviously.  The ratings are nowhere near where they used to be.  Yeah, I mean, that, you know, it was, and then you get the diehard Chappelle guys that  are like, you're, why are they trying to replace you with Chappelle?  I was like, dude, that fucked me, too.  Don't send me emails about I'm trying to replace him.  Jesus Christ.  I'm pissed off, too.  It sucks, dude.  It's horrible.  Well, we got the outhouse story.  You want to go to it?  Yes, yes. 
[00:52:00]  I want to hear that.  I don't even know.  It's just the update on the guy here.  Poli in New Hampshire now know why a man was busted inside a woman's toilet.  Gary Moody was found inside the waste tank of a woman's outhouse.  Get this, guys.  It all happened at a rest stop in Maine.  Moody says he was looking for his wedding ring when a girl found him inside.  He was too embarrassed to actually come out.  Moody has since entered a not guilty plea to trespassing and disorderly conduct.  But no ring was actually found, by the way. 
[00:52:30]  What do you guys think?  I think if you believe that one, I got a bridge in Brooklyn I'll sell you.  Yeah, you know, maybe it was up to a dastardly deed.  I think he was up to a dastardly deed, all right.  We'll just leave it at that.  Yeah.  But that's kind of filthy, don't you think?  Disgusting.  In the churlite?  Right.  In the churlite?  The loo?  I used to have a neighbor that used to say that.  In the churlite?  Archie Bunker used to say that.  Oh, Jesus.  It looks like Eric Lovin. 
[00:53:00]  We've got pictures of Gary Moody here.  Toilet man.  Wow, that is something.  He said he lost his wedding ring.  Right.  Which is really funny because he's married.  Now, imagine having to go home to your wife and tell her why you were arrested.  That you were in a goddamn toilet.  I'd imagine if you did drop your wedding ring in an outhouse toilet, whatever, you would  definitely go in and get it because the hell you would get at home if you don't come  home with your wedding ring.  Let me tell you something.  You drop it in there, you're going to get a stick or something, a wire, anything. 
[00:53:30]  You're not crawling into the shithole to get your ring out.  Obviously, he's covering his ass, but you can see where a guy would actually go through  that to try to retrieve it.  Yeah, if you drop your ring in there and your wife doesn't understand why you didn't go  fetch it, divorce that bitch.  Seriously.  But she's not going to believe you is what I'm getting at.  Oh, maybe not, but still.  Imagine the dialogue.  You'd come home.  You know, where's your wedding ring?  I dropped it.  Come on, stop. 
[00:54:00]  In the toilet?  Yeah.  I'd take her back to the toilet and go, you want to get it, bitch?  Go ahead, get it.  There it is.  There it is.  Right there.  You see the little shiny thing next to that pile of shit?  That's it right there.  Go ahead and grab it.  Wouldn't you leave a note on the door instead of just hiding under there and dodging logs  while you're looking for it?  Yeah, perhaps.  Wouldn't you leave a note like, please, I'm searching for a ring.  Don't come in here and shit for a few minutes.  Dodging logs.  Yeah.  It's just raining shit as you're trying to get your wedding ring back.  He didn't even lock the door.  No.  He went in and the door wasn't locked. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, I've gone out on a limb.  I'm going to say he was not looking for his wedding ring.  I'm telling you.  Dodging logs.  And it was a dastardly deed.  You've got to look out for your wedding ring like that.  That's funny.  What was he doing that it just slips off and falls in the toilet?  I don't know.  I'm freaked out that Opie's like, well, if that happens, you've got to go get it.  Are you fucking kidding me, Dad?  Dude, I'm, you know, I can't imagine, I'm not married, but I can't imagine going home  without the wedding ring ever.  There was always a thing.  What, you don't wear a wedding ring? 
[00:55:00]  No.  No.  I'm married.  Yeah, I know you are.  How's that going?  Good?  Awesome, dude.  Awesome.  I used to be married, and I had to wear it, like, all the time.  Right.  It was one of those things, you know, if I didn't wear it, there'd be questions as to  why I wasn't wearing it.  Or, you know, sometimes I'd take it off just because, like, it's building up a callus.  It's putting that ring around that.  Oh, the one right here.  Yeah, that even when you don't wear the ring, you're wearing the goddamn ring kind of thing.  And I'd take it off just to kind of, you know, get that, scratch your finger. 
[00:55:30]  And I'd be so paranoid that I was going to lose it.  I was going to lose the finger.  Finger.  Finger.  You're going to lose the finger.  My finger.  Bastards.  And I'd be so paranoid I was going to lose it.  Finger.  You're so...  You're so...  You're going to lose the finger.  Finger.  Finger.  So self-conscious.  That's funny, you bastard.  The finger.  Finger.  We point out each other's crutches and flubs.  It's just my thing. 
[00:56:00]  I can't say finger right.  Finger.  Finger.  Finger.  Finger.  I just say finger.  Anyway, continue, though.  You were going down a good road.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're so paranoid that you're going to lose it that you're distracted by everything else.  You've got to keep tabs on it.  Because, God forbid, you do lose your wedding ring.  You've got to go home and now explain it.  And much like I've said in the past, if you ever go in a store and you don't buy anything and then you walk right out, you've got to kind of hang out by the cash register and let people see you not rushing out of the store because I feel so guilty that they're going to think I was stealing something. 
[00:56:30]  It's not the weirdest thing, but it happens to me as well.  You do.  You feel guilty.  And then imagine having to explain to your wife that you lost your wedding ring knowing that you really lost it but knowing she might be thinking something else and now you're looking guilty.  Now you look guilty because you're making up an excuse even though it's not an excuse.  So it's a pain in the ass.  So what you do is you get divorced.  So you spend lots of money.  You dive in a pile of shit and find the ring. 
[00:57:00]  So perhaps this guy.  You jerk off for motivation while you're doing it.  Perhaps this guy had had an experience in the past where he lost his ring.  Take a picture of some vaginas, you know, for proof.  Right.  So you can show your wife, look, this is really where it was.  This is where I was.  He belly flopped right into the shit to try to find that thing.  I didn't lock the door or anything.  I call it his face and body in the candy jar.  A creep.  The best is like, yeah, why wouldn't you have a sign on the door? 
[00:57:30]  Jesus.  Looking for ring and pile of shit.  Imagine looking up and seeing the face of a cop just staring down at you.  Oh, shit.  Like, oh, die.  Looking for something.  I don't think he's here to take a shit.  Goodbye.  And how did they catch him?  That's what I'm...  So they said a woman was going to take a dump and she looked down and she saw this face.  Well, why would she look down, though?  That's another freaky thing.  You go in there, you just do your business and run out, man.  If you're going to do that, why wouldn't you commit to the act? 
[00:58:00]  Maybe rub shit on your face and blend in with your surroundings?  Like you're in the nom.  Like you only camouflage yourself.  Schwarzenegger in Predator when he can't rub the mud on himself.  Right, right.  You're going to kill Colonel Kurtz.  Like Rambo when he was in the mud and nobody could see him.  Yeah, in the wall.  That's what I'm saying, right.  This guy knows nothing about concealment.  Is there a turd with eyes, right?  A turd with eyeballs and eyelashes looking up.  Hey, that piece of shit's got a camera. 
[00:58:30]  What's going on?  That's ridiculous, man.  That guy had a fetish.  I don't care what anybody says.  There's no ring.  There's no chick.  You don't...  You just...  Dude, it's unimaginable.  There's the update on the story, though.  There's going to be more that comes out.  All right.  We've got to get you out of here.  You've got to do cold pizza here at 8, right?  Oh, I have no idea.  I guess.  Yeah, that's what Ben was telling us.  Ben said you have to be out of here by 8.  I was going to try to just come in and surprise you guys this morning, but, man, I got like  50,000 emails from your fans. 
[00:59:00]  I had to email them going, God damn, I'm going tomorrow, fuckers.  Jesus Christ.  You're a stand-up guy, bro, because a lot of our old friends have kind of...  No, but I wanted to surprise you guys.  I wanted to just come in and you guys go, holy shit.  But literally, as soon as I got out of the station, I checked my fucking emails, and I  had like 13.  13.  13, you're a dick, you're an asshole.  Oh, we got our rats.  Fuck you.  They're there.  You son of a bitch.  He's doing Stern. 
[00:59:30]  He's on Stern's show.  It means he's in New York and he's not going on your show.  Yeah, and some of them were like, dude, I love your comedy.  I think you're great.  But how the fuck could you?  You know what I'm saying?  Those are the one pests.  We don't care what show anyone goes on.  That's fine.  You know, you're promoting and shit like that.  It's just the people that do other shows and they're in town.  We know they're in town.  And they don't call.  Don't stop in.  Don't do anything.  And then we're like, you know, come on.  I felt, dude, I felt dirty.  I was like, fuck, I was going to try to surprise you.  I had to call Hopi.  I was like, dude, I'm in town. 
[01:00:00]  I started the show by saying you left a really nice message.  People were saying that you actually told them that you had dropped your wedding ring at Stern's studio.  We weren't buying it.  I had a camera.  That's funny.  But I thought you guys were in the Sirius studios.  Really?  I thought you guys were over there.  That would be awkward.  Somebody had told me that you guys were in those studios over there.  Really?  Like, using them to broadcast. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  No.  So I thought that.  And then I asked somebody there like, fuck no.  Yeah, that wouldn't happen.  Oh, shit.  Because that's the message I left Hopi.  I was like, oh.  It's all good.  I was like, holy shit.  It's all good.  I just was talking about how I was disappointed.  But it's all good now.  It's all good.  Disappointed?  Do you think I'd come over here and not come and say hi, you fuck?  We weren't sure what was going on.  Because all of a sudden, I mean, our pests are brutal, man.  All of a sudden, the phones just explode.  So, Carlos on Howie.  Why isn't he coming in?  And I'm like, yeah, why isn't he coming in? 
[01:01:00]  Because I didn't hear anything.  That's all.  So if you were surprising us, then that's...  I was going to try, but Jesus fucking Christ.  Holy shit.  Now, I'd rather dive in a pile of shit than deal with those people again.  I'm telling you.  Damn.  If you have a choice between dealing with our pests or jumping in a pile of shit, you better  belly flop right into that ass.  I'm diving in a pile of shit.  I'm not kidding, man.  They're animals.  Dude, they were animals.  I mean, and I'm telling you.  Orlando right now is feeling the wrath of the ONA pests right now. 
[01:01:30]  All day long, they're going to feel the wrath of the pests.  What happened?  Well, the Jim Phillips thing that we started with.  We send our troops out to just destroy other radio shows.  Dude, our...  They interfere with their program.  They can't take live calls the entire show.  It's just brutal.  Carlos, yes.  We're scared of them.  We created this, right?  Yeah, we know they're going to turn on us someday.  We created this.  We created...  We ugly.  We created a show that's a little different than other shows because it's very, very interactive.  Very.  I mean, we have so many websites and fan sites now. 
[01:02:00]  It's not even funny.  And they're a part of the show.  They give us a lot of the really good material that we even use on it.  I mean, they are literally, like, part of the show.  We're scared of them.  They have an army, right?  It's called the ONA Army, which is, you know, there's other shows that have had this army concept, whatever.  But they've taken it to the next level.  They got websites that we don't know where they're at.  They're, like, secret websites that they only give out to certain people.  That they coordinate.  You don't even have them.  They coordinate these attacks with these websites.  So they all get on.  They log on. 
[01:02:30]  They're, like, you know, just in case they may be monitoring this website, let's go to the secret website.  And I email some of these faithful fans saying, I'm Opie from Opie and Anthony.  I just want to check out this secret website.  Oh, no, you can't have that address.  You don't have clearance.  You don't have clearance.  It's like Fight Club.  You know?  You're Opie.  No, I'm not even kidding.  I forgot.  I was reading recently.  They were getting some kind of assault together on somebody that did us wrong, I guess.  And they're, like, all right, wait.  They might be monitoring this site, so let's all go to that other site. 
[01:03:00]  Wink, wink.  And then they have coordinates.  They make maps and stuff.  They make maps of the area that they're attacking so that when they call in, when they call in, they can say, you know, Pete from whatever town is near the studio.  Right.  They broadcast the show online so that people that aren't in the listening area can listen to the show, hear the subject, and call in.  And then they just destroy them on the phone.  They start with these bogus questions, maybe, and then just unload on what assholes they are on the air. 
[01:03:30]  It's very, very involved.  And you just hear the host getting more and more frustrated because every single phone call they take is from one of our pests, and it just destroys their show for that day.  And we keep it going for a day, two days a week until they call our bosses.  And we've had this happen every time.  They always end up calling our bosses behind the scenes.  Could you make them stop?  This is bullshit.  I'm going to sue.  Oh, and A pests, do me a favor.  Next time, can I please surprise my friends without you guys crawling up my ass?  Thank you very much. 
[01:04:00]  Jesus Christ.  And, you know, that plea that you just made is working very well.  John from Jersey, fucking liar.  Why didn't you do their show first?  Oh, my God.  See what I'm saying?  What a bullshitter.  Well, wait a minute.  I call Bravo Sierra.  Hi, Carlos.  For all you guys that are saying what a bullshitter, I didn't have to come on if I didn't want to.  Of course.  Even now.  You're a big star.  So fuck you guys writing those emails. 
[01:04:30]  I'd have to come back.  I don't have to kiss any ass.  I want to, you pricks.  Piece of shit.  You're making it worse for yourself.  Do you understand what I'm telling you?  I know.  I'm just being a dick.  I'm kidding, guys.  Just shut up.  Accept it.  Take it.  Shh.  All right.  Dude, the emails were brutal.  I'm not even teasing.  They got satellite photos from outer space.  Satellites.  They probably got pictures of me with hookers and shit.  Oh, yeah.  Of course they do. 
[01:05:00]  Of course they do, right?  Don't make us release these.  Exactly.  Let's say hi.  I'm sorry, guys.  Let's say hi to Peter in New Jersey.  Peter.  Hey, boys.  What's up, man?  What's up, Peter?  Hey, talk about being afraid of your wife.  My buddy was working in a stock room.  He's up on a ladder.  He falls down.  The wedding ring gets caught and plucks his finger right off.  Yeah.  Oh.  And his wife still makes him wear the ring around his neck on a chain.  His ring finger is gone? 
[01:05:30]  Gone.  Why wouldn't you just put it on another finger?  Finger?  Did I say finger?  His ring finger.  Punching out.  All right.  His finger.  Fire.  And Jay in Jersey.  What's up, Jay?  Hey, Ant, you remember the Steaming Schindler's List where the little kids are hiding from  the Nazis?  Yeah.  In the fucking, in the toilet?  Yes.  In the outhouse.  That's where this guy got the idea from.  And that wasn't shit.  That was like concentration camp victim, you know, eating each other fucking shit. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, God.  Oh, man.  Jesus.  You know, and these kids were, you know, they didn't seem to mind.  It's 8.07 in the morning, sir.  Oh, delicious.  I love you guys.  All right.  What an awful human.  Ben's raw ass.  What's up?  Oh.  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  All right.  Ben's raw ass.  What's up?  I just want to say, was that little Jimmy Norton underneath that outhouse playing Monster  Logs?  Was it Jimmy?  No.  No, it wasn't.  I'm not above that, but it wasn't. 
[01:06:30]  Anything else, Ben's raw ass?  Yeah, I just want to say, I called that number you gave out.  Actually, I was just going to try to get it saved in my cell phone for later on.  See, they're already getting together for an attack later on today.  Go ahead.  But they said, the guy says, hold on.  And then within seconds, they put me on.  I was on the air.  And I really wasn't prepared too much.  And because I had called the number right away, and you had confused me with the big 
[01:07:00]  O and Duke, I kind of fucked it up a little bit.  But not before I got a couple of good plugs in and told them, you know, tell the afternoon  guy to quit ripping them off.  Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.  Tell him, Fred.  Tell him, Fred.  Hoo, hoo, hoo.  But if we can keep this assault going until later in the evening, I'm sure it'll work out.  Yeah, no, we want you to really attack later on. 
[01:07:30]  This is not a radio show.  We'll see what kind of talk show the guy really has.  Will he blow off the calls, or will he go with it?  Yep.  I'm sure he'll go with it.  Hey, thanks, guys.  All right, one more.  Doug out, Doug.  What's up?  Good morning, guys.  Carlos still there?  Yes.  Don't fuck with the boys, Carlos.  I never would, dude.  I never would.  I'm a loyal guy, bro.  Dude, I was on with the fucking monsters twice this morning.  Yeah.  First time.  These guys are fucking atrocious.  They can't fight. 
[01:08:00]  They're pretty popular in Florida, but what city?  Orlando.  Orlando and Jacksonville.  Orlando and Jacksonville.  They just...  Oh, I know those guys.  Yeah, you've probably been on their show.  I have been on their show.  They do big numbers down there, but I don't know.  Most people just don't get it.  They're redneck-y.  Yeah.  Hey, Carlos.  Yeah.  Don't go on their show anymore.  I don't know.  You're in deep shit, bro.  Anyway, uh... 
[01:08:30]  See how thick your skin is.  Oh, yeah.  No shit.  I'm putting some cream right now.  I don't know these monsters.  I don't know what they do.  Tell them they don't want to see them.  They'll understand.  Believe me.  Exactly.  Doug out.  Doug, go ahead.  I got on with these assholes, and I got a Not You in there, and then I called them out on ripping shit off.  They were all proud about ripping shit off.  And then the one thing was a fucking kicker.  They made it sound like I fucking hung up on them.  Uh-oh.  Is he gone?  The fucking pussy pieces of shit.  Everybody with a phone out there. 
[01:09:00]  407-916-1041.  Call these fucking assholes.  Because it was about two minutes later, I got on, I told them I had some inside information about a news story.  I got right back on and said, hey, this is Doug.  I didn't hang up on you.  You guys hung up on me, and they clunked right out of me again.  Of course.  Of course.  And that's not even the show we're attacking today, but...  It's okay.  It's good warm-up.  Softening the beaches.  All right.  It's the Jim Phillips show that's on that same station from 3 to 7 p.m. on the East Coast.  Yeah. 
[01:09:30]  All right.  The monsters didn't steal anything.  It's the guy, I think, the afternoon guy.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's definitely...  This one was all about the afternoon guy.  All right.  We're going to take a break, Carlos.  Jesus Christ.  Thank you so much, Carlos.  I got off easy, I guess.  Yeah, you did.  Jesus Christ.  And, yeah, leave Carlos alone.  He is a friend of the show.  Please.  We have a lot of enemies.  Carlos is not one of them.  As a comic, the worst thing to do is go to a club after fucking Carlos has been there.  It's like, I got 80 people on a Saturday early show. 
[01:10:00]  I'm like, oh, man, we're glad, because Carlos was here.  He had fucking three shows on a Sunday, and we had extra shows Monday.  I'm like, well, you know, must be a parade this week, huh?  That's fucking awful.  It's like fucking a chick going, oh, thank God, your cock is not as big and delicious  as the last time.  And now all the comedy club owners are like, you're not going to do theaters now, are you?  No, I'm not going to go make the big bucks so I can come back to the comedy club. 
[01:10:30]  Of course.  That's every comedian's goal.  Leave the theaters to Jimmy.  Yeah.  He fucking sells everywhere.  It's fucking disgusting.  As a comedian, when you hear, like, oh, Nancy was here last week, you're like, fuck.  He's downplaying it, man.  Jimmy's kicking some serious ass.  But I'm just saying, like, there's a guy, some guys just in markets wherever you go,  they just sell out and add shows.  You're kicking ass, though.  You're doing really well, man.  I'm fucking, I'm three-market Jimmy.  You want to deal with Boston or Philly? 
[01:11:00]  I'm the fucking king.  Three-market Jimmy.  The rest of the country?  Who?  Cricket, cricket.  Oh.  We'll change that.  Wait till they get a hold of that HBO special.  That's right.  When are you getting an HBO special?  Yeah, I shot it.  Taped and ready to go.  Dude.  Yeah.  Dude.  Shut up.  Do you have any idea how huge that is?  Huge.  I hope so.  It went so well, though.  Don't make a face.  I hope it does.  Huge.  Look, it did a lot for Patton Oswalt, and I'm just hoping it won't propel me.  Not the same, dude.  Not the same, because they don't give HBO specials out. 
[01:11:30]  I know.  They don't give them out.  I mean, in the past year, there have been, like, three of them, and they've all been, like,  stars.  These were half stars.  They did halves again, so I'm hoping.  Oh, so they went back to doing.  Yeah, but you know what?  Still, dude, it did huge for me, bro.  And this was, like, ten years ago.  Did you do them in Aspen?  No, no, no.  I did one in L.A. and one in San Francisco.  But, dude, it's huge.  Huge.  Dude, it's amazing.  I can't wait to see it.  Awesome.  All right.  Carlos, thank you so much.  The show.  Love you guys, man. 
[01:12:00]  It's on tonight, right?  Yeah, tonight at 10.30.  10.30.  Or, unless you live in Central or Mountain Time.  I know.  Then you've got to check your 9.30 or whatever.  But who lives in Wyoming?  Why would you live there?  We get calls from Wyoming every morning.  Really?  All right.  We get calls from Canada every morning.  Wow.  And some...  Who was the person from Ireland or whatever?  Remember that?  Was it a chick?  I don't know.  They're also listening all over the world.  I don't know, but she's got fingers.  So, mine and Mencia.  And you guys got to be the only ones doing any kind of real edgy racial humor on Comedy Central now. 
[01:12:30]  You got to be the only ones doing it.  So, yeah, I guess we're doing some fun stuff.  Yeah, check out the show tonight, 10.30 on Comedy Central, right?  Love you guys.  All right.  It's Carlos Mencia, everyone.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday. 
[01:13:00]  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  Cancel your appointment.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday. 
[01:13:30]  Stay out the bushes.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  XM202 
[01:14:00]  All right. 
[01:14:30]  That was very cool of Carlos Mencia to stop by and say hi.  Very, very cool.  This is the first time I ever met him in all the years up in...  Really?  Yeah, man. I've been hearing his name for so many years and, like, missed him close.  We've never actually met him before.  It was very cool.  Brad from Huntsville, Texas.  www.gaycampers.com  The Monster and his crew just got 3,000 subscriptions to the gaycampers.com newsletter in their email box. 
[01:15:00]  Ow!  Jeez, Brad, that's a little harsh.  Especially when you're not giving them to people on this program who might enjoy them.  Oh, wow.  Ben.Sparks at XMRadio.com  I'm like a camper.  Let's see.  Okay.  Just going through the instant feedback.  All right.  Very good.  Yeah, please leave Carlos alone.  We have plenty of enemies. 
[01:15:30]  He's not one of them.  I think it was very cool that he came in.  He didn't have to come in.  I was really disappointed yesterday.  And right after the show, I had a voicemail from the guy.  Like, oh, oh, dude.  You know.  So.  He is loyal.  Let's say hi to Border Judge, the trucker.  Border Judge, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, ONA?  Hi.  Mr. Norton.  Hi.  Y'all are sounding great.  Thank you.  Wanted to let y'all know that not only is the Phillips file stealing the assault on the media, 
[01:16:00]  they're also stealing the banana phone song.  Yeah, that was pretty unique to our show, too, I do believe.  XM Kids.  Yeah, I never heard it before you guys started playing it.  They were wearing it out a couple weeks ago, so.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Add that to the list of reason to hate them.  All right.  Yeah, we're going to be attacking the show later this afternoon.  And we'll see how good of a talk show he really is.  Or a talk show host, I guess I should say.  Thank you, Border Judge.  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[01:16:30]  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  I've got this feeling so appealing for us to get together and sing, sing.  Sticks in your head.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Ding, dong, ding, dong, ding, ding, banana phone.  It grows in bunches.  I've got my hunches. 
[01:17:00]  It's the best.  Beat the rest.  Cellular, modular, interactive, modular.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Quiet, quiet.  Ping, pong, ping, pong, ping, pong, ping, banana phone.  Stop it.  Stop it.  It's no baloney.  It ain't a phony.  Stop whining.  It's a cellular, banana phone.  Quiet, quiet, quiet.  All right, Clint, what's going on?  What's up, shit, dicks?  Hey, Clint from whackbag.com.  Hey, I'm hoping I'm going to do some justice to Ben Drawl after his phone call. 
[01:17:30]  It was great.  He called in, and I'm sure this is going to piss you two off.  They said, we're not worried about Opie and Anthony because they're only 145 pounds apiece,  and if they come to O-Town, we'll whoop their ass.  Come to O-Town?  Let's not go to O-Town.  All right, we'll be staying away from O-Town.  O-Town?  Ugh.  Yeah.  That didn't piss you off.  I hope it didn't.  What, are they going to beat us up?  You guys suck. 
[01:18:00]  Mr. O-Town?  What the fuck's O-Town?  A hot group.  Damn, I'm so sorry we're not huge, big, stereotypical, fat radio douchebags  out at some shithole bar gig with your gut hanging out.  Ugh.  That's the worst.  Just go to some shithole bar gig and sit there with your big belly, your big radio guy gut.  Bring it on, fatties. 
[01:18:30]  Bring it on, fatties.  Stop.  O-Town.  Oh, God.  Can you not try to come up with cool names for your fucking city?  Does that, please tell me that means Orlando.  I'm assuming.  Is that what it, you lit, it's fucking Disney World!  That's what Orlando is!  You can't be tough from O-Town when Disney's there!  It's what O-Town's known for!  It's what O-Town's known for!  Not for being O-Town!  For being the happiest fucking place on Earth! 
[01:19:00]  It's Disney World!  Holy shit!  Are you going to sick the Mickey Mouse gang on us?  Watch it, man.  O-Town.  Yeah, their gang is real cool.  They wear the fucking Mickey Mouse ears down the street so they know they're badass in O-Town.  You're talking to guys that are in New York fucking city right now.  Stop it!  We had a Dodge gunfire just to get to work today.  Oh, please!  And you live in O-Town.  Shut the fuck up, fatty!  There are homeless guys on the sidewalk that try to eat your ankles when you walk past them. 
[01:19:30]  You gotta watch from your feet up until the buildings up above your head when you walk in,  and everything in between.  There could be an assault that comes on you at any second in New York City.  Not O-Town.  What's gonna happen?  A kid let go of his Mickey balloon, and it'll knock you on the head a few blocks away?  Are you kidding?  It's Orlando!  It's amusement parks!  It's roller coasters and fucking gay people in furry suits taking pictures with your kids! 
[01:20:00]  O-Town.  O-Town!  Bring it on, fatties!  Bring it on!  Tell them when they come down to O-Town!  Yeah, brother!  Stop it!  O-Town!  You have no idea who you're fucking with.  You have no fucking idea.  O-Town.  Welcome to the happiest place on Earth.  O-Town!  O-Town! 
[01:20:30]  Disney.  Yeah.  How did Dodge a drive-by shooting today?  Who doesn't?  Just to get to work.  What did you have to do?  It's New York City!  What did you have to do?  What do you do down there in O-Town?  Dodge a convention bus?  Yeah, what?  Oh, look out!  Think of the drive-by that could happen on that big long tram that takes you from the parking lot to the front gate of Disney.  That could be dangerous.  Stop with your O-Town. 
[01:21:00]  Everyone wants to try to give a cool name to their fucking city.  Did the O.C. start that shit?  The O.C. Orange County?  You ever...  I lived in Orange County.  It's not a cool place.  It is not a cool place.  It's...  It's lame.  It's Orange Groves.  The O.C.  Wow, that's hip.  The O-Town. 
[01:21:30]  It came from, I think, people being cool.  You know, the CPT's pretty cool.  You gotta watch out when you live there.  Right?  Hell yeah.  That's a cool place.  That warrants having...  Initials.  Not O-Town!  Stop it!  Do you realize that there's areas of New York City, if you make a wrong turn, you will be killed?  Yeah.  Do you realize, fatties, you fat fucks, do you realize that every once in a while a guy,  just for the hell of it, decides he needs to kill people and runs around Times Square with a gun, 
[01:22:00]  a loaded gun, and just starts firing off rounds?  Yeah.  That it happens.  When was the last time in O-Town some homeless guy grabbed a cobblestone and pummeled someone over the head  for no apparent reason whatsoever?  Do you realize every day we leave this studio and we have to pass by a homeless guy with a pit bull?  Yeah.  And one of these days this guy will let, you know, sick the pit bull on us?  Because we're not giving him money every day?  Don't give him money.  But they live in O-Town. 
[01:22:30]  O-Town.  You fat fucks.  Homo-Town.  Stop it.  Trying to sound cool.  Stop.  You live in Orlando.  You accept it.  Don't try to make it sound cooler than it is.  So when we fight, do you have like a finishing move?  The Goofy.  You Hulk Hogan wannabes.  Didn't O-Town come from the group?  I have no idea where they would have gotten O-Town. 
[01:23:00]  Right after Backstreet Boys came out, O-Town came out.  Right.  Are they from Orlando?  Yes.  Yeah, that probably did.  The fag group.  The fact that they're using it, though.  Shut up, you nigg.  Like we're from O-Town.  Jesus.  Guy's whiter than you, Opie.  Goddamn, Opie.  That was a very uncomfortable moment.  I wish your old basketball player friend was here to punch you in the fucking face.  I didn't actually say the word.  That's what it was uncomfortable about.  I'm going to toss this banana at you.  Is this O-Town?  I would assume it would be silly if...  Sorry, Derek. 
[01:23:30]  If you played something else, it would have really been stupid.  Well, what luck that we had Eric's iPod lying around.  Yeah, this is the tough shit coming out of O-Town.  He's from that faggoty part of the country, too, isn't he?  Look, even our faithful listeners in that area know that they live in a faggoty area.  Come on, try to hear the lyrics.  There's nothing tough about Orlando.  Stop.  Turn it off!  Nice.  Thank you.  I'm enjoying that.  What do I think of Chi-Town? 
[01:24:00]  Yeah, okay.  That's tough.  Chicago.  That's pretty tough.  Chicago's brutal.  Bring it on, brothers!  That's where Leroy Brown was from.  Bad, bad guy, then.  I'll say he was.  All right.  He hooked up with Doris.  Detroit.  Got it fucked up.  Right.  You know?  Jim Croce loves singing about big guys who got stabbed and shot.  He must have gotten beaten up.  You don't mess around, it's slim.  Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. 
[01:24:30]  Just some big guy beating the shit out of some little guy and his guitar.  But filling him full of holes and stab wounds.  Later on, yeah.  Croce loved a good violent bar murder.  You're a big guy, but you're going to get fucked in the end here.  If it's not Operator, can you help me play this song?  It's a look at this big fuck.  I'm going to stab and shoot him for hustling me in a pool game.  All right, well, we've got to be worried about O-Town.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Yeah, look out.  Fat radio guys from O-Town. 
[01:25:00]  Talking shit.  Yeah, perish the thought that anybody's in radio that might be in a little bit of shape.  Please.  A little bit.  Jesus.  Not to say anything, but Jesus, Opie has a body on him.  No, no, but did you ever watch him reach for something?  Like the shirt will lift, and there's that area between the shirt and belt where it's  just stomach.  Solid.  All right.  Quiet.  Exactly.  No, no, no, no.  I don't mean anything weird. 
[01:25:30]  I'm just saying.  Stop it.  It's the type of place you'd love to rub a scented oil.  Stop it.  Peel how soft my skin is.  Monsters are reversing the attack, and they're telling their listeners to call ONA.  Well, let me look at the phones.  Ha ha ha.  Wow, a big attack coming from O-Town.  Good luck to you.  They say we only have four listeners. 
[01:26:00]  Ha ha ha ha ha.  And they won't even say your names because you are scared.  No, we won't say their names.  I don't know their fucking names.  We have no idea they're the monsters, but I don't know what their names are.  Go ahead, guys.  We know they do such a scary show.  They've got to call themselves the monsters.  Ruin their show so they can't take any phone calls.  Go ahead.  Have fun.  All right.  We've got a few things we could do here, Anthony. 
[01:26:30]  We've got bombs and flubs.  Oh.  Now, also, we've got crazy guy from yesterday.  Did you tell Nathaniel to not include you in those flubs?  Ask him personally.  No.  I'm actually amazed that I did not.  Well, I have one flub.  You have one flub.  One flub, no bombs.  How many flubs do I have?  Bombs and flubs volume two.  You have one, two.  You only have two flubs, Anthony.  I have two flubs.  How many flubs does Jimmy have?  One, two, three, four, five, six. 
[01:27:00]  Wow.  Wow.  You have something against Jim Norton there, Nathaniel.  Yeah.  What's the problem?  I love Jim Norton.  Problem with fan.  All right.  You're going to have to deal with it, Anthony.  Yeah.  You hate my name.  No.  I just hate that.  I like Nathaniel.  It's a very classy name.  Well, thank you.  But fan is a little odd.  It's a mouthful, though, sometimes.  And if you're going to go short, it's fan, unfortunately.  Have you gotten the website Fans Fans yet?  So you could open up a fan club.  Fans Fans.com.  Fans Fans.com. 
[01:27:30]  Or .net.  Oh.  .tv.  Thought, I said.  Shock it down.  Let me write that down.  Thought.  By the way.  Thought.com.  By the way, are you related to a former president of the United States of America?  No.  I'm related to William Jennings Bryan, who is almost a president.  We really haven't exploited this kid yet, but we have an intern working for us that is  related to Thomas Jefferson.  Now, so he says.  So he says.  Look at him.  I want some proof.  What?  He looks like a $2 bill?  He looks like he has a little that slave blood in him. 
[01:28:00]  A mulatto mongrel.  A mulatto mongrel.  He looks like he's got just a slight bit of slave blood in him.  In recent years, it came out that Thomas Jefferson was having sex with some of his female slaves,  and that there were offspring from these slaves.  And they've actually been recognized by a whole society of Thomas Jefferson's relatives,  descendants, as actually being.  They've been accepted into the fold as relatives of Thomas Jefferson, these black descendants. 
[01:28:30]  We got Drew Boogie in studio that is barely black.  Dude, you're like the first shade of black.  You know that.  No, you're probably like the second shade of black.  Look at me.  Look at my hair.  That tells everything.  That's true.  But you're like the second.  I think black goes in, let's call it ten shades.  How many shades do you think Drew's got?  How do you come up with ten shades of black?  Is it like a Kevin Bacon game you play?  No, Jimmy the Greek, tell us.  Mickey Rivers, ten shades of black. 
[01:29:00]  Halle Berry.  You put Mickey Rivers on one end of the spectrum.  Halle Berry, three to four shades of black.  Wow, who's like one shade?  One shade of black.  There's a player in the NBA, one shade of black.  Colin Powell.  Colin Powell?  No, who's one shade of black is our own intern, Sam, here, who's related to Thomas Jefferson.  You put him one shade of black.  Now, how old a guy are you?  I'm 21.  Now, in your 21 years, have you looked up your history, your family history? 
[01:29:30]  Not, I mean, no more, yeah.  No more than a...  No, yeah.  Yes, yes, yes.  Well said.  I'm going to stick with yes.  You have.  Yeah.  And what did you find?  I have not found any black people yet.  No?  But you found Thomas Jefferson.  Yeah, yeah.  So now who was the female in that?  I don't know, but you know what?  Yeah.  I'm bringing in a family tree.  You are?  And we're going to, yeah.  Sam, do you think you're part black? 
[01:30:00]  Let's just get right to it.  You know, for a long time now, it's been questioned.  Yeah.  It's definitely, this show is not the first time it's been black.  I wouldn't doubt it.  I'm talking very slight, obviously.  I don't even think he's one shade of black.  He might be near the zero shade of black.  Like point three shade?  Yeah, like in between zero and one.  Yeah.  I think every job I've ever had and probably 70% of the people I've met in my entire life  have asked me about my ethnicity at one point or the other.  It's the hair.  Most of the time, yeah.  The other jobs, they just, uh... 
[01:30:30]  Sam, what, um, where are you from?  Yeah.  I say, I know my hair looks like I'm either...  Did you ever see the Seinfeld episode?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Where he goes out with the guy and she's trying to guess his race?  Yeah.  That guy is pretty much you.  That's like...  Do you have a big one?  Uh, well, you know...  Should I, uh...  No.  You don't have to pull it out.  Well, Jimmy might want to.  I'm going to be in the privacy of a bathroom stall.  Just let Jimmy know when you're going to be going to the bathroom next. 
[01:31:00]  Will do.  We'll get a lot of info that way.  I won't actually look.  I just have mirrors on my shoes.  Hey, brother.  We just got to find out who the female was in the Thomas Jefferson connection.  That's right.  By the way, we mentioned that he sounds a lot like John Heffron.  Kind of an obscure reference.  Not a lot of people know John Heffron.  You want to let's comment standing a lot of people know him.  Sure.  I guess a lot of people...  I shouldn't say that to...  John is very...  I'm sorry, John.  He probably listens to the show.  But we found something else that sounds a lot like Sam. 
[01:31:30]  All right.  How do you do?  I'm Sam.  Sam.  Wow.  Same name, too.  Same name.  I am Sam.  Listen.  Hi, this is Sam.  Ew.  Is that Sean Penn?  Yeah, right?  Yuck.  Where's the other one?  You nerd!  It's mostly the first one.  Hit it.  Oh, what?  Is that a different one?  You only have two?  That's right.  All right.  Is the third one good?  The third one's something else.  Oh, okay.  Listen to this.  How do you do? 
[01:32:00]  I'm Sam.  It's the same fucking voice.  I never saw that.  Why would you?  Is Sean Penn playing a retard?  Yeah, like he's doing it out politically.  He stinks.  I have to see that, because any celebrity that's playing a retard, I have to see it.  So, he's related to Thomas Jefferson.  Drew, do you think there's a little black in him?  I'm really not sure.  Yeah?  I've never seen anybody as mutated as him before.  It's a little strange, isn't it?  Because you're very pale, like you're very white, but there's something black about you. 
[01:32:30]  He's very pigmented, pigmented-ly challenged.  Yeah.  What are they, like, when people ask you what kind of nationality or whatever are you, what  do you tell people?  Oh, what do you say?  He's white, damn it.  Yeah, I mean, I...  Do you say Irish, or what do you say?  I usually just say white, because, I mean, all the ancestry is just straight, white, off-the-boat,  European, nothing of any type of...  And how weird is it to be related to Thomas Jefferson? 
[01:33:00]  Um, pretty weird.  Did you just wake up one day, and someone had to tell you, like, when you were seven?  I think, like, eight is about the age when you start finding out weird shit about your  family.  Yeah, I don't even remember how it came up, but yeah, I was seven or eight at a family  reunion.  Something like, you know, you've been learning about Thomas Jefferson in school.  Guess what?  You're related to him.  Yeah.  That is weird.  Did a waitress ever slip, like when you were getting something, that she offered you a side  of melanin?  Not yet, no. 
[01:33:30]  Never been refused service at a Denny's?  No, no.  No, you get a cab easy?  Um, easy enough, but I'd say it's good that my parents look definitely white.  Yeah, both parents?  Yes, both parents definitely look white.  Oh, is something going down here on TV?  Well, we're trying another assault on the media, but I think the person we sent out is not,  uh, I don't know.  Well, let's, uh, I don't want to say anything until, until this fails me.  You think he stinks, but you, you don't want to say he stinks.  Oh, boy.  Is it a failure?  I think, uh, we're, uh, looking at a, a failed attempt on. 
[01:34:00]  Oh, no.  On a assault on the media.  It's a perfect opportunity.  Oh, no?  No, it's just a guy walking by.  Someone walking by in the background.  All right.  Where is he?  What, what happened?  Oh, they all had their hands up in the, in the other room.  Sometimes, you know, you panic.  Like, sometimes, someone panic.  Sometimes you just can't pull the trigger when you're in that situation.  Danny would have pulled it off.  Where is he?  He blew it, right?  Let's get Ben in here, because they were setting that up behind the scenes.  Oh, come on.  Ben is always.  Oh, wait, is this going to replay what they showed earlier? 
[01:34:30]  Because that's the same shot they showed earlier.  Yeah.  Well, that's, that's the, that's the pre-tape, but they were live.  They were just live.  Uh, yeah, Ben coordinates this on the phone all the time.  So, I want to know what was happening on the other end of that phone.  All right, Dan is going to give me the answer to the NBA guys.  Uh, the name of the NBA guy.  Dan, go ahead.  Hey, ONA.  Hey.  Hey, hey, little Jimmy.  Uh.  Hey, it's, uh, Tayshaun Prince from the Detroit Pistons.  Tayshaun Prince.  Yeah.  He has a black name, but he's as white as could be, but he has, like, slight black features, 
[01:35:00]  right?  And his arms are, like, six feet long, and he's seven feet tall.  Wow.  Oh, maybe it's not the same guy I'm thinking of then.  And, and you're calling him one shade of black, right?  Yeah, most definitely.  Most definitely.  One shade of black.  All right.  Punch it out.  Thank you.  So, uh, Sam, you have no Thomas Jefferson stuff laying around?  Um, not, I can find.  He's pretty black.  Which one?  Let me see, yeah.  That's not him.  That's a dark picture of him.  Yeah, that's not the guy.  Yeah, that's the Time Magazine OJ thing.  That's, that's not the guy I'm thinking of. 
[01:35:30]  Okay.  So, there's another guy in the NBA.  Tony Parker?  I'm not sure.  All right.  All right, so, uh.  All right, Sam.  All right.  No Thomas Jefferson stuff, you said?  Not, I mean, on me.  I could try to find some stuff.  That would be kind of cool if you could bring something in.  Whatever proof I can find, I'll bring in.  All right.  Ben, what happened?  Nothing.  I don't know.  I didn't know.  He called me, he called the hotline, and he says he got stopped.  They're at the live shot right there, but stop.  How can they stop him?  Who stopped him?  They can't stop anything.  Danny was down. 
[01:36:00]  No, I think it takes a set of balls to pull off the assault on the media.  It certainly does.  It's not easy to do.  And Danny is our go-to guy.  Nathaniel, of course, another one of our go-to guys.  Who was just sent?  One of the interns.  Mike.  Mike.  And remember when, who was it?  Who was the guy that just panicked on us?  Mike.  That was another Mike.  That was another Mike.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, because you see the shot going down, it's live, and you're there, and you just  can't pull the trigger to do it.  You've got to just throw caution to the wind.  Danny just like, he just walks out with his sign like, all right, no problem. 
[01:36:30]  Here I am.  Here's my sign.  Go fuck yourself.  He doesn't care whatsoever.  One guy probably said to Mike, don't do that, and he went, all right.  Mike's on the phone.  Mike the failure.  Mike, what's up?  They blocked me, man.  They wouldn't let me go through.  The guy had his hands all over me.  How did they block you, though?  So you're supposed to wait for the live shot and then run into it.  I did.  I did.  There were guys surrounding the entire thing.  They wouldn't let me go through.  The guy put his hands on me and said, you've got to go around.  I said, there's nothing.  I'm not doing anything illegal.  I'm not doing anything illegal.  Who was the guy? 
[01:37:00]  What's up?  Who was the guy?  I don't know.  Some security guard in a suit.  Yeah, see.  We should have sent Danny.  Yeah.  Well, who do they work for that they're allowed to stop a guy from walking?  I have no idea where they work for.  I'm going to go ask him.  Want me to go ask him?  Yeah, you should ask him, actually.  Do you feel like a tool right now, Mike, that you can get the job done?  Yeah, definitely.  I was yelling.  I was trying to yell.  Oh, couldn't close the deal.  Probably like, hey, hey, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  He's probably nodding to people.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:37:30]  Opie and Anthony.  I'm talking to people.  You know what we ought to do?  We ought to send somebody else, this might sound complicated, with a video camera, to  tape one of these assaults from that side.  I want to see what the security guys do and what they're allowed to do.  Oh, that's a good idea.  That would be hilarious.  Who the fuck are they?  Behind the scenes footage of an assault on the media.  Just fucking city streets, scumbags.  Very good.  That shot we were just looking at on the TV, that's where he was supposed to go?  Yeah.  That was Nina Sky down there, the two girls that sing.  So if they have security with them, that might have been a little extra problem. 
[01:38:00]  Because security's not allowed to step in and stop them from walking behind a live shot.  That's right.  They're not allowed to go around.  Go fuck yourself.  You don't have a permit.  He should have jumped right in the middle of the whole thing.  You fucking chimp.  All right, Mike.  Well, come back with your head lowered in shame.  I will.  I will.  I'm on my way.  Good job.  Look at the bright side.  Slink back, Mike.  Look at the bright side.  You got the guy that made his terrible wow flyers going around Times Square.  That guy from yesterday, the crazy guy that was in here, with his terrible flyers. 
[01:38:30]  No one was even listening to Ben at all.  No one was listening to him at all.  I just like how he kept going and going, waiting for a reaction from somebody.  You got to admit, that guy was pretty funny.  Did anyone hear him?  I guess he was on the last few minutes of the show yesterday, this hardcore fan.  What a lunatic.  Dean.  Dean, crazy guy.  We had him sit in as we recorded the 6 a.m. hour that we do on the East Coast. 
[01:39:00]  We do like a best of hour or whatever, and Anthony and I intro the bits.  When will those bits be playing?  Tomorrow and Friday.  All right.  So the guy sat in with us for those intros to old bits and stuff.  And after the show, the guy was just a lunatic.  Basically, a guy from Toms River, New Jersey, decided to print up about 100 flyers.  Cost him like 90 bucks for 100 flyers.  Jesus.  What did he print them on, photo paper?  Oh, that's right.  You were gone.  You didn't get to meet this guy.  Look at his lunatic flyer. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, I didn't meet him.  I like this kid.  Let me say, happy birthday, little Jimmy Norton.  He's got a picture of me and got a picture of, who's the woman in the skirt?  Yeah, it took a little while to figure out.  See, it's supposed to, I guess, be a hooker and your car, which you would want for your  birthday.  It's like a picture of a Saturn and a picture of a hotter hooker.  It looks like he just picked the first picture of any female he found on the website.  Or these are the little clippings he had left over from the ransom, no hero, for the missing 
[01:40:00]  child in the neighborhood sociopath.  What a lunatic.  He came in here, and I couldn't even make eye contact with him.  And I did the whole recording for the shows with my head down, and I couldn't even look  at him.  The second we were done, my headphones went off.  I swear, within three minutes, I was in my truck driving away.  I didn't want pictures.  I didn't want to talk.  I wanted out of here.  He's a good boy.  He's a lunatic. 
[01:40:30]  He's a good boy.  Yeah, but he just, he talked and talked and talked and talked and talked.  And, you know, he was promoting the show yesterday.  No, he stuck him in Steve's studio with Steve for like a half an hour.  That was, made Steve real happy.  This audio's good?  I haven't, how is it, Nathaniel?  It's all right.  He just goes on and on.  He just.  Well, we got crazy guy audio from yesterday.  So, we're going to play a little of this for everybody, okay?  The first track, crazy guy in Steve's studio.  And I guess the boys ask him why he's shaking. 
[01:41:00]  Let's go to the tape.  Son, we live in a world that has walls, and those walls have to be guarded by Pat Battle.  Who's going to do it?  Son of a bitch!  You fuckers.  Yeah, I love that.  Meanwhile, I have a heart attack because I thought I prepared the wrong audio.  No, just Pat Battle slipping in there.  Oh, man.  All right, where is it?  No, it's this one? 
[01:41:30]  All right.  Pat Battle.  All right, so crazy guy from yesterday.  Let's go to the audio, see if there's anything here.  Even though we brought Nathaniel in for the Bombs and Flubs segment that we're going to do eventually today.  Sure.  I'm versatile.  Here's crazy guy in Steve's studio.  Anthony's ready for his photo.  No.  You wanted to get a photo with Anthony?  Oh, this is different?  Yeah, sorry.  Why are you shaking?  Uh-oh.  What's the problem?  Now I'm confused.  I don't know what anything is.  I apologize.  I might have.  Okay, that's fine.  I meant to switch those two.  Basically, the guy isn't just a hardcore fan, and he wanted pictures of all of us. 
[01:42:00]  He was bummed Jimmy left the show early.  I think I took a picture with him.  I'm not even sure.  No, you didn't.  Huh?  I never took a picture with him?  You said it was against policy.  Oh, yeah.  Against policy.  We told him that D.C. wouldn't allow it, and he freaked out.  Oh, because he hates D.C.  And then he started taking candid shots of me or whatever, and then he's like, I need  a picture of Anthony.  So that's where this tape picks up.  I'm like, you want a picture with Anthony?  There's plenty on the websites, and you can Photoshop yourself right into them.  Anthony's ready for his photo. 
[01:42:30]  You wanted to get a photo with Anthony?  Why are you shaking?  Why are you shaking?  Crystal meth.  I don't want him to run away.  Oh, no.  Follow me.  Anthony's ready for his photo.  Follow me.  Good.  I was so gone by this point.  Here, follow me.  We're going to get a picture with Anthony.  No, Anthony's over here.  Anthony's in here.  And stay out!  What, did you get him to walk through a doorway and slam the door on him? 
[01:43:00]  I got him to walk to the security area.  The front door, yeah.  And you shut him out?  Yeah.  Not all the way in the hall, but just in that area where they're contained.  Yeah, because he was standing there, and I was walking out, and Poe goes, you need to  use the bathroom, Anthony.  And I was like, yeah.  Letting the guy think I was going to the bathroom.  And then when I walked out, Poe goes to open the bathroom door.  I go, I'm not using the bathroom.  I'm hitting the elevator.  I'm gone. 
[01:43:30]  Bye.  That's hilarious.  More audio from Crazy Guy.  It took me forever to get here.  That's why I'm shaking.  And then to get into the studio and, you know.  Oh, really?  Say a piece and, you know.  Did they bring you on here?  Just to get used to it.  Was that?  Yeah, I was on here.  Oh, that's cool.  So, you know, I got my piece.  As long as they get, hopefully they have the crowd, they have the crowd, like, ready for,  you know, to pile into Times Square.  And I told them I'm not going to hand it out to 85-year-old women that aren't going to buy XM.  You hand it out to a rich white guy walking down the street that, you know, looks like he can take a curse word. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah, here's the deal.  Well, he was convinced that because we mentioned that he was going to be down in Times Square, like, once for maybe, I don't know, 45 seconds.  Yeah.  He was convinced there was going to be a huge crowd down there.  He was going to be mobbed.  And then he would hand out his flyers.  But, see, the problem is the people that would show up to that are people that heard it on the radio.  So, they already have the XM, so they don't really need to grab the flyer from the guy, you know what I mean?  He didn't really understand that concept. 
[01:44:30]  And there's not many people walking around in Times Square listening to this show.  Right, right.  Or any show, for that matter.  So, he's trying to explain exactly what he was going to do.  I know why you guys think he's crazy, too.  Because it's so foreign.  He's actually talking about marketing this program.  Nobody's ever heard him talk like that before.  That is true.  He is a lunatic.  Wait, you mean you believe in this show and want to hand out a flyer?  Are you nuts?  Curse word.  No, but you can take a curse word, too.  I'm not going to hand it out to an ascetic Jew.  Well, of course not.  What is a guy who can take a curse word with life? 
[01:45:00]  Is that good of a good character?  Yes, I am a very good character.  Why do you think I listen to O.P. Anthony?  Touche.  Right?  I'm a fucking smart guy.  Touche.  Touche.  Touche.  He said touche.  Fencing in there.  Fencing with Steve.  I don't know who said that.  So then we got a couple, uh...  Is that Thanner Touche?  Or is it Thanner Touche?  Thanner Steve's Touche?  Hold on.  Let me just write that down real quick.  And then...  What?  Sorry.  Thanner.  Who said touche?  We both did.  All right.  Here we go.  So then he hit the street and he's trying to explain... 
[01:45:30]  On the street explaining assault on the media.  He's trying to explain the concept of assault on the media, people.  What he was doing is just accosting people going by, just saying the words,  XM Radio, assault on the media.  So he'd go up to people, say, XM Radio, assault on the media, and think they would know what  the fuck that meant.  Yeah.  And then hopefully if they stopped, he'd go into this rant full of pronouns that don't  really, you know, explain what was going on. 
[01:46:00]  So it's, uh...  All right.  He wasn't the best at conveying the idea.  No, it doesn't sound like that.  I bet he'd do a good media assault, though.  Yeah.  Uh, there is a, uh, patbattle.com now.  Look at that.  I just punched it up.  Brought to you by Virus Radio.  Listen to the best of ONA.  This site is dedicated to the hottest woman in news, Pat fucking Battle.  And then they have a bunch of things.  You sunk my Pat Battleship.  It's an uphill Pat Battle.  Pat Battle, I am your father. 
[01:46:30]  Welcome to the Pat Battle Royal.  Wow, there's a whole bunch of pictures of Pat Battle and just sayings like that.  Pat Battlestar Galactica.  Someone is going to send her this link.  And she's going to go, why?  I don't get it.  I don't get it.  Oh, she'll be with me, then.  Pat Battle, Bob.  Very good.  Patbattle.com.  This shit is between me, you, Pat Battle, and Mr. Soon will be living the rest of his short-ass 
[01:47:00]  life in agonizing pain, rapist shit.  Mossless, lossless.  Love it.  Did you notice a sign in the front of my house that said Pat Battle?  Storage.  You know why you didn't see that sign?  Because it ain't there.  Because storing Pat Battle ain't my fucking business.  That's why.  I like his Tarantino impression.  All right, here's audio of Crazy Guy. 
[01:47:30]  On the street explaining assault on the media.  This doesn't make any sense, but let's listen in.  There's no shorts in the waters.  No.  And then they tell you that soda's going to rot you deep.  And then they tell you this.  What they do is they throw up a wow sticker.  You just got to go behind them.  They just got one of those Florida stars that were doing it.  So they're pretty much promoting.  They want to assault the media.  We've got to spread the virus so the stock goes on.  They invest in the stock. 
[01:48:00]  They go up.  Everybody's happy.  Okay, okay, look.  It was hard to hear, but basically I heard sharks in the water.  Yeah.  Soda that'll rot your teeth.  You cut this up and just put it together out of context or something, right?  He could.  There is not a human being that could possibly be that incoherent.  No, that's just one take.  And, yes, I was a little far away.  I know it doesn't sound so hot because I didn't want to shove mics in people's faces so that they were onto it.  Right.  But, yes, that was just one thought of his in a row.  What a babbling idiot. 
[01:48:30]  He's a good boy.  He is a very good boy for doing this for us.  Look, we're bad-mouthing the one person that's out there marketing our show.  And because of him, we're going to do something called Opie and Anthony's first annual Promote to Show Day.  Ooh.  Ooh.  We've got to get a date, and then basically we're encouraging the ONA Army, maybe, the faithful listeners to show up at the station.  We're going to just start in New York.  First, we have to run it past management to make it our own so no one rips us off.  I think you guys should do it anyway regardless of what you're saying. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah, we're rebels.  And we're looking for, honestly, hundreds of people to show up one day and donate a few hours to just completely promote the show throughout Manhattan.  In various ways.  In various ways, right.  Hot chicks, maybe own a, I don't know, a moving sign company, you know, those trucks that have the moving billboards.  I don't know.  We're going to try to find a day that makes sense for everybody, and then we're going to build this thing around that day. 
[01:49:30]  And I know we were going to get some hot chicks to hand out WoW stickers.  Why we haven't been able to yet, I don't know.  But I vote for big, fat ones.  I want to get big, fat chicks to hand out WoW stickers.  Great idea.  That better represents this program.  And tiny, tiny little bikinis.  The smallest that are legal, big, fat monsters in high heels handing out WoW stickers.  There's a Jersey band out of Morristown named Pat Battle.  Who knew?  I want to hear some of their music. 
[01:50:00]  Oof.  They just popped it up on the website.  They just changed their name, right?  You think they did?  I don't know.  Well, their big song is Back to You, John.  This is Paris, I'm telling you.  This town's like a great big...  That is waiting to get fucked up.  All right, can we get back to Crazy Guy, please?  Of course.  On the Street Explaining Show.  On the Street Explaining Show.  XM Radio.  The way the news is lying to everybody, they're assaulting the media. 
[01:50:30]  They're sticking signs up, they're sticking signs in the windows, making sure that the media  knows that they're lying to you.  Telling you to keep the rotten to the soda, the sharks in the water, tell your child about  the place destroyed.  But then they wait until the end before they can possibly tell you which toy it is.  So, what are you going to take?  All the toys away from the kids' hill?  A lot of them?  Yeah, exactly.  Everybody's from XM Radio.  Do we sound this crazy when we explain this?  He's explaining this to just regular people? 
[01:51:00]  Yeah.  To anyone that would stop walking, he would start going off.  And he doesn't make any line between the media and the show.  He just says, they do all this stuff, and there's the shark thing, and then what you  have to do is put a sign up, and then there's a...  It sounds like a loony, like, conspiracy guy saying the news is lying to you.  Here's this flyer that makes no sense whatsoever.  He just sounds like a crazy person.  Someone's saying he sounds like a raving lunatic from 12 Monkeys.  Oh, wow.  Handing out flyers. 
[01:51:30]  I love this guy.  He's a classic.  It's in the teeth, Bob.  It's in the teeth.  Yeah, there's footage of him handing out flyers on Camp Street in New Orleans.  Some Andy Castro flyers.  He's a classic, though, man.  I love this kid.  Crazy guy.  I want to hold him.  Maybe we should send him to O-Town.  Yeah.  Tough guy in O-Town.  That funny bits.  It's just, like, screaming babies. 
[01:52:00]  People getting hit.  Yeah, that was just a show.  He was trying to describe the show, and he comes up with, yeah, they play clips of screaming  babies and people getting hit.  Well, that is the show.  Did he mention Opie and Anthony at all?  Did he ever say Opie and Anthony or Jimmy Norton or the Opie and Anthony show, ONA?  He'd get sort of an Opie and Anthony in there somewhere, but mostly it was about the assault  on the media he thought was the only way to market the show or to get people to understand  that it's a talk radio show that does funny things. 
[01:52:30]  That's good.  Captain Quig is a big fan.  I knew there was an assault on the media somewhere.  Assault on the media.  Strawberries.  How many portions did you have?  He also couldn't figure out how to get in touch with the show, despite the number being  on the unit.  He had a big problem with Washington.  Well, he couldn't figure out the phone number, even though it's right on the display.  But he called Washington and asked for our number.  Look, for yourself, right there.  And they wouldn't give it to him.  Yeah.  And he was very angry with that.  It takes more resourcefulness to get Washington's number than it does this show's number. 
[01:53:00]  Right.  All right.  See, look, the first annual Promote the Show Day has begun.  Joe?  Yeah.  What's up?  Yo, I got five box trucks.  I run all over New York State.  You guys want to hook me up with something?  I put them on the back, big posters on the back of the truck.  I'll run them all over New York State for you.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Let me ask you just a question.  Say someone who comes to you and says, how much does that cost a day to have one of those  trucks drive around New York City? 
[01:53:30]  That I couldn't tell you.  I'd have to say, advertising-wise, probably a couple hundred bucks a day.  Not bad.  Yeah.  How many thousands of people see that?  Even more than a couple hundred bucks a day.  It's never been thought of for this show.  Well, if we're going to do this first annual Promote the Show Day, we've got to get one  of these box trucks to ride around Manhattan.  We want to just focus on Manhattan for a day.  Agreed.  See what we can do in one city, and then maybe we'll expand it to the other big cities  that we're broadcasting.  I'm in Manhattan, too.  I'm all over.  All right.  Cool. 
[01:54:00]  All right.  If you want, you want to take my info over and give me a call?  Oh, fair.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hold on a minute.  Ben or somebody will get your information.  Information.  Information.  Thank you.  No.  I was just handed a note.  What's the note, Opie?  Oh, this just in.  Danny, very pissed at Pete's Pulp Fiction Pat Battle thing.  Uh-oh.  Why?  Well, because Travis, Than, and Danny came up with their own Pat Battle Pulp Fiction  remix.  Oh, no. 
[01:54:30]  Well, let's do it.  Look how pissed Danny is.  You can see it in his face.  God damn.  Danny?  What happened?  Hoo-hoo.  Tell him, Fred.  Yeah, exactly.  I don't know.  Me, Nathaniel, and Travis, we were just going off after the show one day with some Pat Battle  lines, and we thought it would be funny to do some.  And, uh, looks like someone beat us to the punch.  Wow.  Tell him, Fred.  Hoo-hoo.  You came up with one?  With a bunch?  Yeah, Jimmy.  Can we hear it? 
[01:55:00]  Yeah, they're very...  I want to hear them.  They feel very confident, by the way.  Yeah, let's hear it.  They handed this disc in proudly this morning.  Like, um, you might want to listen to this before the show.  If you like good radio.  Yeah, right.  They pretty much want to say, we guarantee this is radio gold.  Are you ready to chuckle?  You like to laugh, sit down, enjoy.  So the boys, uh, Than, Danny, and, uh, and Travis came up with the Pat Battle Pulp Fiction  remix.  There's like eight of them here, right?  Yep.  Right?  You ain't got no problem, Jules. 
[01:55:30]  I'm on the motherfucker.  Go back in there and chill them niggas out.  And wait for the...  Pat Battle.  ...which should be coming directly.  You send in...  Pat Battle?  You feel better, motherfucker?  Didn't quite have that baritone, uh...  That baritone sound of Marshallis Waffles.  It's got a bad voiceover.  Night of the fight, you may feel a slight sting.  I just ran to see... 
[01:56:00]  That's Pat Battle.  Fucking what you're doing.  Fuck Pat Battle.  All right, hey, gotta give it to the boys.  That's good.  That one was very good.  Do you know what's on my mind right now?  It ain't the coffee in my kitchen.  It's the...  Pat Battle.  ...in my garage.  Oh, Jimmy, don't even worry about it.  Well, no, no, no, no.  Let me not think about anything.  I'm going to ask you a question.  When you came pulling in here, did you notice a sign on the front of my house that said...  Pat Battle.  Storage?  Jimmy, you know I can see no shit.  Did you notice a sign in the front of my house that said... 
[01:56:30]  Pat Battle.  Storage?  No.  I didn't.  You know why you didn't see that sign?  Why?  Because it ain't there.  Because Soarin' Pat Battle ain't my fucking business.  That's why.  Now...  Tell him, Fred!  Woo-hoo!  Somebody else did do that one, but in fairness, if you've seen the movie, we know how you  came up with that connection.  Right. 
[01:57:00]  We're looking at anything at all.  I don't think Buddy Holly's much of a waiter.  Maybe we should have said Pat Battle section.  Which one is?  Two Pat Battles!  No, it's not.  That is Pat Battle.  That is Sue Simmons.  I don't see...  Brenda Blackman.  She's a midnight officer.  Wow!  Very good.  Three local anchors.  That happened to share the same shade. 
[01:57:30]  That is funny.  Royale with cheese.  You know why they call it that?  Because of the metric system?  Check out the big brain on...  Pat Battle!  You're a smart motherfucker, that's right.  And you will know my name is Pat Battle!  And I lay my vengeance upon thee. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah, and I'll bet you $10,000 he'll ask his ass off.  I don't give a damn if he does.  Pat Battle.  What do you make of all this?  Man, I don't even have an opinion.  Well, you gotta have an opinion.  I mean, do you think that God came down from heaven and stopped...  What the fuck's happening?  Oh, shit!  Oh, man, I shot Pat Battle in the face.  Why the fuck did you do that?  And finally... 
[01:58:30]  Don't you hurt him!  Nobody's gonna hurt anybody.  We're all gonna be like three little...  Pat Battles.  And what's Pat Battle like?  Come on, Yolanda, what's Pat Battle like?  What?  Cool.  Correct the mundo.  And that's what we're gonna be.  We're gonna be cool.  Excellent job.  Very funny.  Bravo to the boys.  Danny, Than, and Travis.  Good job.  Excellent. 
[01:59:00]  Very good job.  Thank you.  And I do believe Radio Gold.  All right.  Very funny.  That was great.  We wanted to smash you guys, and we just can't.  Nah, they were too confident, man.  Those guys know.  Yeah, sometimes you just know.  Sometimes when you do this, you just know, right?  That's right.  Battle Storage.  It should be the name of a place that you put your belongings.  Wow, everyone is calling like crazy.  They're all motivated about this promote the show for a day thing.  Yeah, look at that.  Wow.  But if we're gonna do this, we have to go big.  Yeah.  If we're gonna promote the hell out of it, and like ten people show up with, you know, 
[01:59:30]  a couple signs, and if we're gonna do it, we gotta go big.  Gotta go big.  We gotta be organized.  Maybe we do a massive assault on the media that day, you know, handing out WOW stickers  with the fat chicks.  We got trucks riding around.  We gotta go big.  Gotta go big.  James the Trucker.  What's up, James?  Hey.  How y'all doing?  Hey.  Hey, I'm telling you, man, those monster guys are total douchebags, man.  I cannot get over these guys. 
[02:00:00]  They're sitting there, they're trashing you, so I wanted full salt on them.  Well, it looks like we got under their skin.  Just a little bit.  And it also looks like they didn't really prepare a show today.  Now, did they?  They didn't at all.  All right, thanks, James.  All right, flame it out.  We're scared of the fatties from O-Town.  O-Town.  Look out.  It's a small world after all.  That song plays in your town.  Stop it. 
[02:00:30]  O-Town.  All right.  I like that song.  We're gonna take our first break or second break.  I don't know.  Second break already.  Ooh, Laszlo's outside.  Ooh.  There he is.  We'll talk to...  What?  Tell him what?  Laszlo always comes prepared.  Wait, there's something going on here.  What's going on, Ben?  What's wrong, Ben?  Benny.  The monsters in the midday guy want to fight you.  I don't know.  I was just listening to it briefly.  Want to fight us?  They want to fight Opie.  No, they want to fight Opie.  Oh, okay.  Do they even know who they're fucking with?  Fight.  I know. 
[02:01:00]  Fight.  What?  Do they want to have a little radio fight?  They want to have a boxing match.  Dude.  Oh.  Rocco.  Shut the fuck up.  Hey, dude.  And what?  Then we'll come up with a charity?  You fucking phonies.  That's good.  Say hi to Rocco when you buy a car on the auto mile up in Boston.  Hey, dude.  I have no fucking idea.  I'll fight you.  How did Ben take that from Orlando to Boston?  You went right up the East Coast.  Oh, he did. 
[02:01:30]  Rocco, yeah.  That was a Rocco.  Ah, don't.  Come on.  All right.  We'll step aside.  Oh, by the way, it's my birthday.  It was your birthday yesterday.  It was your birthday yesterday, Jimmy.  Is it a birthday week?  It's not your birthday today.  You get one per year.  Jimmy, how about we do brunch for your birthday today?  I can.  I'm going to see Glengarry Glen Ross.  Oh, that's tonight.  It's today at 2.  Today at 2.  You're going to the matinee.  Or as I say for big laughs, the matini. 
[02:02:00]  Ah, the matini.  We could do a fast breakfast across the street with the wig guy.  He's got to...  Excuse me, sir.  Can I eat potato salad out of your head covering?  We haven't even talked about that guy.  He's a classic hair helmet.  We think he does some kind of drag show late at night somewhere.  I'm surprised he's a waiter.  I'm surprised he's a waiter.  A guy.  Because I still don't know what he is.  Pardon me, androgynous.  Yeah.  Server.  Nah, he's a guy just taking a lot of those warm-ups.  Yeah, you think?  You love him.  And he has the worst wig ever that's covering up a world of hurt. 
[02:02:30]  We don't know what the deal is, but the wig is the worst.  But he's a really nice guy, though.  It's not a wig.  Big fan of Jim Norton's, by the way.  What you do is, it's not even a wig.  Just take black and spray paint over the Yankee insignia on a batting helmet.  It's the greatest thing I've ever seen.  And I want to just live with this guy and hang out with him.  Can we take a picture of this guy?  I hope so.  We've got to get a picture up on opianathlete.com.  It's just amazing.  He's wonderful.  He's a mess.  Snap him with the phone.  He's an absolute mess.  Camera phone.  Make it like you're making a call and just snap it. 
[02:03:00]  People do it all the time.  It's not your birthday.  It is my birthday.  Did you find someone to go to the show with?  No.  You're going along?  I have an extra ticket.  I have no one to go with.  You've got to go with somebody.  I'm garbage.  You have to go with somebody.  Take Steve.  Martini Steve loves shows.  I'd go with Steve in a second.  I love Steve.  Do you have clothes?  Are you going to wear a nice...  Yeah, I'm not going to dress up.  I'm going to wear something.  Yeah?  I'm sure Steve doesn't.  I hate the fact that people go to shows just like slobs.  I kind of like that.  That should be...  Not like the movies. 
[02:03:30]  Remember in the older days, when you watch the older movies, they're all in the movie theater  in suits and ties?  Like, that used to be a night out, going to the movies like that.  And Broadway was always kind of a dress-up thing.  But now, people go dress like slobs.  I'll dress nicer than I am now, just in case I mean...  And it kind of ruins your night.  If you're making a big night of it, you and your gal, your best gal, going out, and you're  going to a Broadway show, you kind of get dressed nice, and you go out, and you're  sitting, you know, next to some Asian businessman dressed like a slob in his I Love New York 
[02:04:00]  t-shirt.  Yeah, I don't appreciate that.  You're going to go, right?  You want to go?  What are we seeing?  Glenn Gary, Glenn Ross.  Alan Alda, Jeffrey Tambor.  No kidding.  When is it?  Two o'clock today.  Dude, I look like shit.  How good are you going to look?  What are you going to do?  You can't go to a Broadway show look like me.  He's the guy I'm talking about that they show up.  You've got to dress up if you're going to go to a Broadway show.  What you can do is just get another shirt and put it over.  You have shorts on.  Are we talking about dressing up for Broadway shows?  You have to look nice. 
[02:04:30]  It ruins the whole atmosphere for everyone else.  This is ruining our image.  We used to be...  You've got to put another shirt on.  You're fine, dude.  That'd be shocking.  Going to a show and not dressed nice.  That'd be shocking.  I might like to do that.  Yeah.  That'd be cool.  Hey, guys.  I have an idea for Radio Gold.  Maybe when we come back, we can talk about the best birthday ever.  Oh, yeah.  Jimmy does have some stuff to talk about.  I had the best birthday ever.  Ever.  All right.  As we go to break, we...  Lucky boy.  We haven't played a mashup in a while. 
[02:05:00]  Is this one good?  The Beatles, Guns N' Roses thing?  I didn't think these two songs would go together, but they really do.  People still doing these?  Yeah.  We were doing the mashups thing for a while, and we rested it.  But one came in, and I don't know.  It was brought to our attention, so why don't we listen to it?  The Beatles and Guns N' Roses.  The Beatles and Guns N' Roses. 
[02:05:30]  Sgt.  Sgt.  Sgt.  Sgt.  Sgt.  Sgt.  Sgt.  Sgt.  Sgt.  Sgt.  Sgt.  Sgt.  Sgt.

[02:06:30]  We're Sergeant Pepper, now they are the man, we hope you will enjoy the show.  Sergeant Pepper, now they are the man, sit back and let me be true.  We're Sergeant Pepper, now they are the man, we hope you will enjoy the show. 
[02:07:00]  Sergeant Pepper, now they are the man, sit back and let me be true.  I don't really want to stop the show, but I know you might like to know, let's sing and sing the song, let me watch your same love.  Let me introduce to you, after you were all in tears, Sergeant Pepper, now they are the man, we hope you will enjoy the show. 
[02:07:30]  Sergeant Pepper, now they are the man, sit back and let me be true.  We're Sergeant Pepper, now they are the man, we hope you will enjoy the show.  Sergeant Pepper, now they are the man, sit back and let me be true. 
[02:08:00]  We're first one.  We're Sergeant Pepper, now we are the man, sit back and let me be true.  We're Sergeant Pepper, now we are the man, sit back and let me be true. 
[02:08:30]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[02:09:30]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  In case you didn't nudge.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[02:10:00]  Getting rave reviews on that Beatles, Guns N' Roses mashup.  Yeah, people really liked it.  I thought it was great.  I was a fan of the mashups, and then everyone was doing mashups, and then I was, I don't know.  That one was really good.  Put together very well.  And instant feedback exploding.  A lot of people really into the Opie and Anthony first annual Promote the Show Day.  We've got to try to figure out the details of that.  And so I just want to acknowledge that because a lot of people are writing in with great ideas for that day, if it comes to be. 
[02:10:30]  And Jer and Philly, I hate you guys for introducing me to the 1 and 10 scale for darkies.  Jesus.  I couldn't stop rating them on my way to work.  Oh, God.  But how many people now are going to do that?  Oh, he's a 3, she's a 4.  That's awful.  Lordy, lordy, that's a 10.  Keith Robinson's an 8 until you hear him talk that he's a 14. 
[02:11:00]  Some people are having pancakes right now going, oh, she's a 10.  Yeah, that would be a 10.  So we've got Laszlo in studio.  Drew Boogie's here.  Wow, what a difference a day makes, huh, Anthony?  Absolutely.  I was just checking my email.  Yeah.  And look what just came in.  Shipment notification.  Oh, fuck.  We forgot to talk about this today.  At dell.com.  Wow.  I am looking at this and noticing that my order for my two case fans on my Dell computer 
[02:11:30]  has finally shipped.  And you would think, wow, it actually worked.  All the customer service that Anthony went through, all the phone calls he made to India  where the customer service is based finally worked.  No, it didn't.  I had to step it up, Opie.  I had to step it up the other day.  But I did a little research, and I found the email address for Michael Dell, the CEO of  Dell Computers, and one of the, like the third man down on the list that was in charge 
[02:12:00]  of customer service.  And I emailed off.  I sent a very intelligent letter documenting the problems I've had with this fan.  And the problems are I ordered these two fans about a month and a half ago now.  And for some reason, the order got canceled, and I only found this out by logging on to  check the order status after a few days.  No email was sent to me that said that the order was canceled or anything.  So I had to call customer service, which took forever, to hook me up with somebody in India 
[02:12:30]  because that's where their customer service is now.  And they try to fool you right away by going,  Hello, customer service.  My name is Dave.  You're not Dave.  Dave, stop it.  The last one I got was,  Hello, customer service.  This is Rachel.  Your name is not Rachel.  Stop.  And the great thing is when you hang up on those people,  they'll call you back.  Like, I got so annoyed, I just hung up on them. 
[02:13:00]  They got your number.  They'll call you back.  We must have had a problem.  No, we didn't have a problem.  I was annoyed.  We were disconnected.  So I called customer service again.  They apologized profusely, replaced the order.  And this is going, this is about a week or so later.  Replace the order.  Again, I asked them this time, send me confirmation emails on this order.  A couple of weeks later, I checked the order status.  Canceled.  Again.  I tried to call up customer service. 
[02:13:30]  Couldn't get them.  So I got on that Dell chat thing where you're chatting with someone from India.  And again, apologizing like crazy.  And now I'm noticing I'm using a lot of capital letters and exclamation points in my posts.  Trying to tell them what happened.  Again, they said they would reorder this, which they did.  They put the order in again.  And I never got it.  Just went on and on.  No emails.  Customer service.  Trying, trying, trying.  There's a great ending here. 
[02:14:00]  Trying.  He's giving this setup.  Yeah.  This is amazing, Jimmy.  So I finally, the other day, after probably eight customer service people, I decide to  write an email to Michael Dell and the CEO and the head of customer service.  Because he has so much time during his day to take care of your stupid dad.  You know something?  Fuck him.  I couldn't get through to an American.  I couldn't get through to someone at Dell Computers.  I was getting India. 
[02:14:30]  I want, you know there are Dell Computers where you get the guy on the commercial on TV where  he calls from bed and goes, is Dell customer service available 24 hours a day?  And there's the white kid sitting in the office with the, it's all dark out.  And he's like, yeah, anytime, 365 days a year, we're here.  No, he's not here.  Hassan is here.  Make him believe his name is Peter.  He's there for me.  Not helping.  They don't show cinnamon lips in the commercial, do they?  No.  Old cinnamon lips.  So I wrote to the bigwigs. 
[02:15:00]  Over there.  The same day, I get a response, phone call from Michael Dell's secretary.  And she is apologizing.  I might have included in the letter that I was a radio talk show host and this subject  has come up a few times on the air.  And a lot of people had similar experiences.  How I used to just, anytime anyone would need a computer, I would recommend Dell.  And I find this very difficult to do these days because of the problems that I've been having with Dell. 
[02:15:30]  And I don't know what's happened with their customer service over the past couple of years.  Perhaps it's saving you money.  But you're losing customers.  You play the I'm on the radio card.  I play the I'm on the radio card.  As you should.  I played that with Gateway.  Isn't it great?  I bought a laptop that was a paperweight within a month.  So I just ranted about it constantly.  And customer service, same thing.  I would send it back.  It would come back still broken.  Yeah.  Just complained about it, complained about it, complained about it.  Until somebody at Gateway got wind that I was complaining and talking about how Gateway sucks. 
[02:16:00]  And then they start FedExing me new machines.  That's what happens.  And so I'm like, the only reason I got this is because I'm on the radio.  Yeah.  So I did a feature, if you're not getting paid attention to, we'll call customer service together on the air.  See?  Yeah, do it on the air.  So I sent the email off.  She called me right back.  I told her the problems I've been having.  And she said she'll take care of it.  And the same day, I got another email from her saying that we have found the parts. 
[02:16:30]  They are being sent out ASAP.  And now today I check my email and they have been shipped.  A month and a half later, it's taken less than a day to get this problem solved with one email or three emails to the higher upper echelon of Dell computers.  What do you need fans for?  Are you building some kind of Uber game machine or something?  No.  One of my fans were broken.  So I went to pull it out and broke the other fan. 
[02:17:00]  I'm a dick.  Of course, I didn't shut the unit off.  Right.  So the blades are still spinning.  Good.  And I hit something with the blade and bang, just pieces of blade went flying.  It's a good thing that the Post didn't have the headline, popular radio host electrocuted through stupidity.  You know, you're supposed to unplug that shit.  I know.  I usually do.  This is such a nothing thing to do with the fan that I screwed it up.  One of the fans was bad.  But I wound up screwing up the other one, so I need two.  But look at that.  See?  And I don't know if it was so much about the radio thing, because it wasn't that they heard me bitching on the air. 
[02:17:30]  I think that sending the letter off to the head of Dell Computer, it's Michael, and then you've got that little underslash thing, a little underslash, and then Dell, Michael Dell at Dell.com.  He's a raging paranoid guy.  Is he?  I've talked to journalists that have interviewed him, like, at his house.  Yeah.  I mean, like, complete pat-down, almost a strip search.  Really?  He's got a compound with razor wire around it. 
[02:18:00]  He's one of those guys that made a lot of money.  Guy's worth a gazillion dollars.  And is just scared that somebody's going to knife him.  Kind of like you.  Well, you know, keep the goddamn customer service the way it's going.  Dell, I don't know what happened over the years.  Over the past maybe two years or so, maybe a little less, but they have just dropped the ball on customer service.  I mean, I love their product.  I've had no problem with Dell Computers.  I've never had to deal with customer service, which is a good thing.  And this time I try to deal with them, and, oh, it's just a mess to try to get a live person.  It's fun to mess with those guys because they do that, oh, yeah, my name's Steve. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah.  And I'm like, really, Steve?  What's your favorite sports team?  He's like, Yankees.  Yankees.  And then you start asking him, like, hey, you know, what kind of favorite beer are you like?  Oh, I don't drink beer.  I'm like, really?  Steve's kind of a beer-drinking name.  He's like, yeah, it's against my religion.  I'm like, huh, that's interesting.  I like curry beer.  Very good stuff.  I saw a whole show on how they're doing that.  A lot of companies are based in their customer service in India, and they're training these 
[02:19:00]  people to speak not only without an Indian accent, but to add in words that are American words,  Americanized English.  Yeah, it's just horrid.  Just ask your customer service guide.  You ever walk to a McDonald's and just kneel in front of the drive-thru menu and worship it?  If so, I don't want you helping with my computer.  Dirtbag.  Third world dirtbag.  There's people drinking water out of rivers that cows are shitting in.  It's just awful.  And they're going to help me out.  All right.  Let's get back to Drew Boogie.  He came in today.  I was wondering why he was here, Anthony. 
[02:19:30]  He just handed me a WOW remix, a brand new WOW remix.  Nice.  It is on WOW Wednesday if you're looking for your WOW stickers.  Self-addressed stamped envelope to us here in New York City.  We'll send them right out to you.  The address is up on opianthony.com.  You got WOW in your car.

[02:22:30]  Drew Boogie, everyone  You're gonna come in and mix for us soon?  Yep  Next vacation  You know, coming, whatever it is  And I gotta get some more records up and what have you  Alright, very good  And some more Pat Battle references  Yes  Oh, that thing's gotta die  The Pat Battle  Never  No  Never  Although I did enjoy it today  With the boys doing their Pulp Fiction thing  And some of that stuff that Laszlo did over there  That was great stuff  You're like, I like the intro to Laszlo's show  I like it all  Where's, Eric, I want to play that again 
[02:23:00]  Who's the kid?  This kid, there's three kids, the Ferrante boys  They live across the street from me  All three of them have been in every Grand Theft Auto since Grand Theft Auto 3  They're like king shit at their school  Oh, I can imagine  They are king shit  They have the perfect kid voice  They have that perfect voice for those things  The one kid that does the Tell Him Fred  Yeah  Is James Ferrante  And he delivered the killer line  In Grand Theft Auto Vice City  At the opening of a commercial  Where he screams 
[02:23:30]  Dad, no one wants to hear about your stupid Vietnam stories  Oh, yeah  Okay  You remember that one?  Yeah, yeah  That was him  Yeah, he's genius  Tell Him Fred  Hoo-hoo-hoo  Well, yeah, so I played that intro  So what are you, the creepy guy that brings him into your studio?  Well, what's funny is I always show  Welcome to Puppy Town, kids  Right  I always show scripts to the parents  Yeah  And say, are you cool with them?  And as the game sort of progressively got a little bit more edgy  Yeah  The parents started rejecting scripts 
[02:24:00]  Oh, no  The parents are like, no, this won't do  No  So I gotta find somebody that's got a hormonal problem  And can sound like a, you know, of legal age  They did a great job  I'm trying to get my niece  She told a story recently  You know, my brother-in-law, he's just a freak  He doesn't care if his kids are listening to this show, you know  Whatever, I mean, that's what a parent decides  Yeah  Whether their kids can handle this  They can or not  She's like four  And she goes, in her little girl voice  She goes, you know, Uncle Greg  I was listening to your radio show recently 
[02:24:30]  Uncle Greg stopped  And you've got a really bad mouth  We turn it on just to hear you say  Who the fuck farted?  And she delivers it in such a way  In this little girl voice  I'm like, I go to my brother-in-law, Mike  I'm like, you gotta get that on tape  So we can play it on the radio  And then she's like, you're driving us crazy with the cursing  She cursed?  Yeah, she said, who the fuck farted?  She was reciting what I said on the radio  Who the fuck farted?  And there's no problem with a kid that age, like, saying bad words?  Oh, my sister wants to strangle, you know, my brother-in-law all the time 
[02:25:00]  Yeah, because it's a whole  I mean, my sister compared to me as the sweetest thing in the world  Yeah  That's why people don't even understand that she's even related to me  But she's married to a guy that's like, you know  He might as well be one of my brothers  He's like an uber fan  And doesn't care if the kids are watching porno  Cursing kids is just hysterical  But it does make for problems when they're out in public  You gotta Mike Denise, man  Get that in here  Yeah  You know what?  Yeah  But another bit just popped into the head 
[02:25:30]  Uh-oh  We're going a bit crazy lately on the show  Ladies and gentlemen  Send in audio of your kids cursing  That's right  Alright, that's an easy one  That's a very easy one  Yeah  Because I know there are parents out there that are very open-minded  And have no problem doing this  You don't have to give your real name with the audio  So maybe you can, you know, save face  I think  At the family functions  An easy way to do it  Because it's not just  We just don't want to hear fuck or shit 
[02:26:00]  Right  Maybe again, movie lines  With a lot of cursing in it  Well, just take it and run with it, yeah  Yeah  Movie lines  Them just cursing  Yeah  Normally, whatever  And we'll play the best ones on the Opie and Anthony show  Yeah  And I got some ideas for some videos  That you might want to send in along the same lines  Jesus  For me  You're going to reen it  Yeah, but immediately  There's an assignment for America  We like to give America an assignment  Assignment America  Assignment America  We've got to have it  Why don't we make up some production for that 
[02:26:30]  Yeah  Because Steve should have been on that  We go down that road every once in a while  Assignment America  This is your assignment, America  Your kids cursing  Send them into the Opie and Anthony program  Immediately  You tools are actually calling me out  On the underscore, under slash thing  You know, you're getting a little too sensitive out there  Yeah  It's not like I said under  I guess that's called an underscore then  The little thing  Right  Yesterday, because I sent that to Steve and Ben 
[02:27:00]  At like 2 in the morning  I was sort of like half ripped  And I sent it to him  And I said  Hey, I thought you might  It was Tuesday  Right  I said  Well, I've been working ahead  Because I'm splitting for Alaska on Saturday  But I  So I sent it to him  I said  You might find this funny  And you know  If you're listening or whatever  And I said  Your old company is quite a joy  Because you know  They asked me if I'm interested  In maybe doing a show  For like on a Friday night  And I said  I'll do 3 or 4  You know, is a goof  And I thought I'd come out  Swinging with a little reference  That like, you know 
[02:27:30]  Got to show props  Show allegiance and shit  And so I sort of come to the next day  And I check my email  And it's like  80 million emails of  Who, who, who  Tell them, Fred  And I'm like  What happened?  And so I like email  One of the guys back  And I'm like  What's going on?  He's like  Oh yeah, they were  You know, talking about it this morning  So I'm like  Uh-oh  So I'm sitting there with the clock  Counting down to the replay  You know  Yeah, the pests  They're everywhere  Tell them, Fred  But here's the intro  To your radio show  I think it's brilliant, actually  It's really, really good 
[02:28:00]  Listen to this  Laszlo's intro  To his radio show  We have a number of very important goals  To accomplish together  In this first lesson  Hey, how do you become a radio DJ?  Say the name of the station  Over and over  Play at least a half hour commercial  Broadcast live from the cookie market  Mix lots of sounds together  Talk on and on  About how you invented radio  Don't, Fred  Play the same songs again  And again  And again  We'll teach you how radio stations operate 
[02:28:30]  If only I could win practice  I'm not going to start the stupid show, Laszlo  That is brilliant  So good  After I got done talking  And I'm scared shitless  Because, you know, I haven't run a board in a while  Yeah  Hotline flashes  And this guy's like  Who's this?  And I'm like  This is Laszlo  And he's like  What was that?  And I go  It was my opening music  And uh  You didn't even begin your stupid show  I know  Because they don't have a sense of humor  And he's like  Oh, this is so and so with Infinity  You know  Who authorized this?  And I said  Dude, you're going to have to talk to  You know  Rob Cross 
[02:29:00]  Who's the operations manager  Or whatever  I said  Because if you don't  Like  Here's the deal  I haven't run a board in a while  And you're about to have like  Dark fucking air, dude  So then  I'm like 20 minutes into it  And I'm talking about how  Weak and stupid  And gay blogs are  And uh  You know  Who wants to hear about  Some stupid guy's trip to the library  And then I hit that other thing  You played yesterday  Yeah  Which is this  Which is this  Let's play it first  And then you can tell us  What happened  Dear blog  I had a wicked cool day 
[02:29:30]  At the library  I've really been obsessing  About my old high school  Girlfriend Julie  So much lately  That I said  What the hell  I decided to look her up  She lives in the next town over  So I got her address  Stopped by  She was really surprised  To see me  Then  I slashed her throat  And I went right from that  Into commercials  And I had like  Hotline flash it again  And it's another guy  That works for the company  He goes  What was that commercial 
[02:30:00]  That just told people  To slash women's throats  Oh god  And I'm like  Oh dude  This is not gonna last  Thank god  And then  Thank god you're here  To remind us  That we just don't want  To go back to that  Atmosphere ever  And then  There's a  One of the guys  That was gonna be  On the show with me  He's a guy I've worked at  Out at DRE  On Long Island  And I don't know  If I can even say his name  But he's sort of  The in-stadium announcer  For a major sports team  Around here  Bob Shepard  He was  No  He was leaving  Thank you  He was leaving  He was leaving the game  And we were saying 
[02:30:30]  He's gonna be coming in  In a little bit  This is like  At the 25 or something  And I said  Well maybe he's gonna be  A little late  Cause you know  It's the big Harry Potter  Book thing tonight  And you know  Maybe he's gonna be in line  Eyeing up young boys and girls  Well the major sports franchise  Is calling him on his cell phone  While he's on the elevator  At K-Rock  You can't go on that show  You know  We can't  We're a major family oriented  Sports team  You know  They can't think  That there's a pedophile  And this is hour one  And I'm like  You know what  I can't fucking do this dude  That's three  In like no time 
[02:31:00]  I can't fuck  I was like shaking  After the show  I was like  This is weak  Well we got a place  For you on 202  We're gonna start  Building out the channel  I think sometime in September  We'll have to  Figure out something for you  Because  Unbelievable  You can't work  In that environment  And it just shows you  The sense of humor  That they have  At the old company  Infinity Broadcast  And that they're hotlining you  They don't have a sense  Of humor whatsoever  This is like an 80 page thing  That they gave me  The week before  Because they started  Getting a little nervous  And they're like  So what are you gonna  Talk about  And I said  I don't know  And they started  Getting a little nervous  Because the last project  I worked on  Has some senators 
[02:31:30]  Clamoring for a federal  Investigation into it  And so  So they give me  This like 80 page missive  That was put together  By a lawyer  And Tom Chiasano  And I was looking through  And I'm like  Where's the ONA stuff  Where's the ONA stuff  And it gets in  They don't say ONA  But there's a little bit  In there about blasphemy  Really?  Yeah  Blasphemy  I guess that's what  You were in trouble for  Yeah  Blasphemy  Wow that's heavy  So they said that now  Blasphemy falls under FCC  That's hardcore  Yeah  Blasphemy is not 
[02:32:00]  An FCC violation  That's what this thing says  They're lying  You highlighted that part  I highlighted all of it  And it has every FCC judgment  You're gonna take a little look  From  We just have to read these  On a weekly basis  We were mentioning this earlier  With what  Carlos I guess  Expletives  Shit  Fuck  Piss  Cunt  Cock  Suck  Motherfucker  Tits  It's unacceptable  But there's  Seven dirty words  There's other ones too  That never broadcast  On even an occasional  Or fleeting basis  Any time of day  Including safe harbor  Included in this category 
[02:32:30]  Are such terms as  Prick  Dick  Pussy  Titty bar  Hard on  Asshole  Douchebag  Twat  Cock  Douchebag is not  An FCC violation  Broadcast should also  Avoid language that  While perhaps not rising  To the level of  Expletive  May otherwise be considered  To be objectionable  By the FCC  And that includes  Douchebag  Twat  Cock  Yeah  Yeah  We used to get  These all the time  They bring up the  Superbowl  Halftime show 
[02:33:00]  That's from  Steve the lawyer right  It has to be  The Steve's  It's in that lawyer  Spacing  That word perfect  Spacing  So  Innuendo  And double entendre  But they don't mention  Us by name  Like we never existed  Right  Right  Fucking assholes  Which is why  In the first 30 minutes  Of the show  Because I called  Cousin Ed  And I was talking  About you know  Babe Fest  And how we were  Hanging out backstage  With Jim Norton  Who was hysterical  And he's on the  Opie and Anthony show  So you know  I was pulling the name  A few times  Just  Dump out of everyone  The FCC  Has recently defined 
[02:33:30]  Profanity  In as many  As six different ways  Blasphemy  Divine  Implication  Is that the word  What does that mean  Example  Go to hell  And god damn you  You can't say that anymore  On commercial radio  Oh wow  That's what this memo says  Personally reviling epithets  Naturally tending to provoke  Violent resentment  Is an FCC violation 
[02:34:00]  Wow  Grossly offensive language  That amounts to a nuisance  With nuisance defined  To be language  That is prejudicial  To the sense of decency  Or morals  Of the citizens at large  Tell them Fred  Woohoo  Vulgar or coarse language  And words that are  As highly offensive  As the word fuck  To be analyzed  Case by case  By the FCC  Words that are  As highly offensive  As the word fuck  What does that mean  That means 
[02:34:30]  The word nigger  That means  Maybe the word spick  That what that is doing  Is that is  That's opening the door  For ideology  To creep in  Where it's no longer  Like in Canada  Their FCC  Whatever they're called  Is a disgrace  Yeah  The worst  Because they have like  Ethnic things  You can't say  That's what that's  Getting into  That's going to start  Getting into  You're not allowed  To do racial  All remarks  Things that are not  Consider profanity  I applaud commercial radio  And I'll tell you why  They're playing right into  The satellite radio  Hands  Keep doing it  Scumbags  Please keep  Doing this 
[02:35:00]  Please keep sending out  These pamphlets  To your jocks  Please please please  Giving them a much  Bigger door  To work with  With fucking with people  That's what it looks like  You know  Here's a  A violation  Which the FCC  Determined to include  Graphic and explicit  References to sexual  Activities  Female voice  I masturbate with  Jeremy's video every day  Not every day  But every other weekend  Craig's voice  Wow  What is it that you  Like about him so much  Female voice  The way he licks pussy  I want to do a threesome  With him 
[02:35:30]  See who's the best  If I can lick better  Or he can lick better  Of course that's a violation  That's a violation  They used to hand us  Stuff like this  And go  You better read this  Right  This is shit  And they would highlight  Stuff like that  And I'd read it and go  Would we ever get on the air  And say lick pussy  Yeah  On broadcast radio  They would give it to us  Like we're fucking children  Effing  Effing children  Give it to us like we're fucking children  Which means they'd give it to us like we're happy  There are so many examples here 
[02:36:00]  That thing was such a  The first part was the scariest shit I've ever read  And then the second part is the transcripts  From like every FCC judgment  And how much they got fined  And it's pure comedy  Yeah  Oh I know  We used to read these things on our  On our old  Blasphemy  You can't  You can't knock God  On commercial radio  But that's where the conservatives  Have just got to  Just  Can you believe  That it's actually now  Something that is actionable  By the FCC  God damn you  Go to hell  Taking the Lord's name in vain 
[02:36:30]  Do the Texas Taliban  Have taken over bro  Yep  Absolutely  God  Unbelievable  Keep playing into our hands  That's why satellite radio  Is going to rule  It's phenomenal  There was actually a commercial  That played during my show  That was talking about  How great advertising is  And call your infinity representative today  And I hit the button  So it wouldn't fire straight  Into the next spot  And when the commercial ended  I go  And be sure not to sign up  For satellite radio  And then hit the next spot  So I have a meeting  At one o'clock today  With KROQ  Please call us tomorrow 
[02:37:00]  Because I know they're firing you  That's obvious  So  Can you tape it?  Huh?  Oh I didn't even bring my mini disc  That was really stupid  They're going to fire you  So make sure you take  Really good notes  Well you know what  Maybe  It's a tax write-off  If you buy one of those  Little recorders  They don't cost that much  You're a smart guy  Oh really?  By the way  Radio stations are playing  Those spots all over  I heard the same exact spot  In Philly when I was driving through  They only play those spots  When they're desperate  For advertising  Sure  Which shows that commercial radio  Is starting to really hurt 
[02:37:30]  When you see a billboard  That says your ad here  That means that billboard sucks  Right  It doesn't work  Right  Yeah that billboard's not making money  It's just sitting there  Waiting for someone to call it  Call it  Like the billboard's alive  So they can advertise  All right  We should take another break  When we get back  We'll see what Laszlo's been up to  With the tech stuff  Oh  Wow Steve  What did he get  I don't know if that's what you want  But I'm just  Well let's take a listen  I don't know  He's got a  Assignment America stinger  Wow  With another 
[02:38:00]  Opie and Anthony  Assignment America  Oh  Nice  Wow  We look and sound professional today  Okay  Yeah let's get that on the  Instant replay later on  Very good  And  Assignment America  Anthony  What is it again  We got  Yes we want to hear your children  Your young children cursing  So get them  In front of microphones  And have them curse  Whether  I think it's not too creative  To just have them blurt out curses  I would just say  Get creative with it 
[02:38:30]  Get creative  You could  As an example  You can have them recite  A famous movie line  That has a lot of curses in it  Maybe from Scarface  Or Casino  Or Goodfellas  Something like that  Or  Have them riff on their own  That's right  Maybe little playmates  In school  And what assholes they are  Shining lines are always  Perfect  Awful  All right  As we go to break  Harry Potter  One of our pests  Ruined it for a bunch of people  Waiting to get the book  The other night  That rules  It was a dude in Dallas 
[02:39:00]  Listen to this  Snape kills Dumbledore  Snape kills Dumbledore  Hey  Snape kills Dumbledore  Like sands through the hourglass  So is the O&A virus 
[02:39:30]  How can I honestly say  Anybody rips me off  When I hear the same exact bits done  That's how I say it  I mean what about wow  That's totally their idea  Oh there you go  Okay  There's something new  There's something new  You know what  I used to do that in Washington D.C.  Tell them Fred  I used to have people  Tie bandanas around their cars  So that women would  Take their clothes off  In the cars  Dude get with it  All right well  I mean  Give me an original idea  Come on  I mean  I know  I know  I used to have my listeners  Tie a bandana around their car 
[02:40:00]  I mean I've done it all  What about going off  On a man  I totally know that's you  All right  Okay whatever  I gotta go  Please  I don't really want to get  Into a discussion like this  He's so delusional  That is really funny  Someone found the clip  Yeah that's something  We couldn't play on the old show  Because of the gag order  That he placed on us  How do you tie a bandana  Around your car  That's a great one  That's a big bandana  What's the matter  My car has cancer  People throwing frisbees  To their cars  Jumping rabbit 
[02:40:30]  God just showing your age man  You can't even tie bandanas  To antennas anymore  It's all hippied out  You honk the horn  Beep beep  He's so delusional  Oh man  Just admit it  Wow is such an original idea  I invented everything  I've done it all  He even said  I've done it all  Wow  Even the stuff  That's going to be invented  I did already  There's no original idea 
[02:41:00]  I went into a time machine  And I already did it  Killed themselves  I've done it all  I was the first one  To do anything  I cracked  Marconi ripped me off  Robin  Remember  What was that thing called  Dot dot dash dash  Dot Morse code  It was Howard code  Earlier  The guy ripped me off  I invented SOS  Robin  What a complete jackass  He's the guy  Wow  Wow  He invented wow  And it had nothing to do 
[02:41:30]  With whip him out Wednesday  Wow it was tying a bandana  Around your car  Thank you Howard  And what were we supposed to do  If you saw  I don't know  He didn't really explain it  Of course he's not going to explain  If someone had a bandana  Tied around their car somehow  Girls would get naked in the car  It wasn't even flat  Girls would get naked  Driving  Taking their clothes off  Crashing into a button  Mr. Robin  I invented traffic accidents  A bandana around an antenna 
[02:42:00]  That reminds me of something else I've heard  It's called the fucking flag  That's not exactly  Somebody's fucking invention  I invented that Robin  They say Betsy Ross did that  I sewed the stars on  It was all me  I don't care  I don't care  I honestly don't care  I don't care  I invented that  That was me  Kirby and Anthony  The virus is spreading  Alright let's go right to the phones first  Amanda in South Carolina 
[02:42:30]  Amanda what's up  Hi how's it going  Pretty good Amanda  Oh no it's my  What would I say a few words to you guys  Oh  Alright  Hang on  Okay  Say it  Okay  Fuck off and die  It has begun  It has begun  Oh my god  I think my pee  Put your awful mother 
[02:43:00]  Put her back on the phone kid  Put your horrible parent on the phone  It has begun  Amanda  Yes  Amanda  Yes  How could you possibly allow your child to say that word  Um  He says quite a bit on his own  I don't  Even if I don't allow it  There's nothing that you can really do to him  Where did he learn it?  Um  TV  Out in the truck  With his dad  Do you get mad when the kid plays the band? 
[02:43:30]  He's in the meth lab  What a mouth on him  He does work  Believe me  Well the bit has begun  Thank you Amanda  Thanks  Bye  Yes record your kids cursing  Get very creative  And send them into the program  We're getting a couple of live versions here I guess  Which is quite funny 
[02:44:00]  We gotta see what this satellite radio can do  You know what I'm saying?  Really take it for a test spin  By the way  A lot of people  Noticing that Steve was really quick with that production piece  Huh?  Yeah  Cause we kinda hinted yesterday  That Laszlo does some really great production  Oh well  The listeners have pointed that out  As a matter of fact  Saying that Steve  A bit insecure  Steve  Uh look  Look at Steve  Trying to pull out professional stuff  Because Laszlo's in the studio  Wow that was quick  I think someone feels threatened 
[02:44:30]  In their producer's seat  Uh seat  Yeah  And then of course  We have Dan from Davenport  The Texas Taliban  Shut the fuck up Laszlo  Go back to infinity  Fucking listeners  Animals dude  They are animals  That's right  I love Laszlo's production  It's great  Laszlo does some of the best production  I've ever heard  Unbelievable  But you can't sit in front of Steve  I love Steve  No that's fine  Look  Steve works 20 hours a day  Dude  Steve does a nice job 
[02:45:00]  I always love when my work ethic is questioned  I emailed him  Hey  Can Laszlo park my car?  You pretty much know  But Steve does a great job  You pretty much said Laszlo does the best production you've ever heard  But Steve  Steve is amazing  I'm making phone calls  I'm producing bits in the other room  I'm running a website  I'm doing like  You know what  I'll put my work ethic up against anybody's  I'm not questioning your work ethic  You certainly were 
[02:45:30]  I am not  Jimmy  His work ethic is a second to none  The guy comes in here  So you have no problem with his work ethic  You just have a problem with the quality of his work  I love what Steve does for this program  Jimmy you heard that right  I did  I emailed Steve on July 4th  I was in my studio working all day on supposed Independence Day  I email Steve  I get a response back in seconds  Yeah I'm plugging away  Working on the website  See  Yeah  It is actually scary  He works like a Filipino factory worker  There was one time  I woke up in the middle of the night 
[02:46:00]  Couldn't sleep  Whatever  And was just doing email  And had a thought about the show  Whatever  So I sent off an email to Steve  Before I signed off  Which was minutes later  I already had a response  And I had to write back  What the fuck are you doing awake?  Yeah  Did it say auto reply?  No  That could be funny right?  I actually  It's funny  Steve is one of my favorite people  And I know you had that meeting today at 1  Otherwise you'd be able to go to Glen Gary Glen Ross  But I mean I'm happy that you were there  I enjoy Laszlo's production 
[02:46:30]  Because there's a lot of variety in the characters  He knows  Steve doesn't drag people in like little children to do voices  Or people with professional radio voices  That's all I'm saying  I like the variety  Tell them Fred  That's right  Come on  Yeah where's your little kid  Actually I did a whole session with a couple girls yesterday  Wow  I didn't sound right  Nice  No but we're gonna  But you're right  Laszlo actually takes the time to drag people in the studio  I have no tolerance  Tell them Fred  You got actual hardcore gangbangers to come in and record voices for GTA 
[02:47:00]  Yeah that's being scared of your talent  Must have been  Trying to coach them  Yeah we need it one more time  You're not selling black enough  Right I love that  Telly  What I love is when you get people in for like a gay character  Yeah  And so they'll bring like a real gay person in like  You know you're just not stereotypical  It's not quite swishy enough  Could you really fag it up a little more  Hey did the gang members love doing it though 
[02:47:30]  They must have loved it  They were going to be in Grab the Throat  Oh sure  They were totally into it  Well you loved being part of it  I know  Never heard my commercial  Well if you guys would play the damn thing  I heard it  I played for like 20-30 hours  Loved the game  I just picked up the PC version last week  But you never did any missions  I did missions  I did some missions  You drive around like a lunatic  Just killing people  You don't really get into the whole mission aspect of it  I do go off on like two to three hour tangents  Yeah  With that game  I really do  The ice cream truck  Yeah  Mission  You know the last game 
[02:48:00]  The Vice  What was it called again?  Oh Vice City  Vice City  I couldn't get enough of  You know with the ice cream truck  Selling the drugs out of the back of it  Yeah  That's a good one  I went all day with that thing  Slinging dope  Just trying to get that one  That game is great  One more sale before the cops came  It was awesome  What do you think about the congressional  Oh I'm  Ducky  Well it's always good to see  You know people as  High and mighty as Hillary Clinton  Yeah  Giving 
[02:48:30]  If she says  You know that there's offensive material  Out there  Then she should probably read the Star Report  Yeah  Because  How can she  Yeah it would be  Shouldn't she just go  Look Chuck  I'm a little upset with this  Why don't you take the lead on it  Because I would look completely silly  Coming out against a video game  Because of content  My buddy Will Wheaton  Sent her a letter  That said  I'm not  I don't know much  I'm just a stupid writer  And everything  But maybe  You should look into  Investigating Carl Rove  Instead of Carl Johnson  Yeah 
[02:49:00]  Which is the main character  In the game  So I  You know  I've stayed out of the flap  I don't want any part of it  Yeah  You know  Maybe she's onto something  Maybe Bill Clinton was a big GTA fan  And he was influenced by  Violent video games  I'm going to go pick up some hookers  Pick some hoes  Give him a cigar  Cigar upper twat  And this woman is now  That's your husband  That's your fucking husband  The guy that was sticking cigars  In an intern's vagina  See that's why  I'm secretly praying  That she tries to become 
[02:49:30]  President of the United States  Because the commercials  I know  That they're going to run against her  Are just going to be  She could keep an eye  On her own husband  Do you want her  Keeping an eye  On your country  On America  Yeah  Oh  Let her try  They're trying to get  That family values thing  And the extreme  Religious conservatives  Are going to beat you  On it  Every time  Every time  So  Just  Go find something else  And they  They always have  Half-assed information  On the games 
[02:50:00]  They never really know  Where the content comes from  They don't know what a mod is  Right  Yeah I was  It's like Hillary  I was downloading some mods  Last night  Getting some new skins  For World of Warcraft  What the fuck are you talking about  Sure you are  We said it on the show  She never played that game  She has no clue  What it's really about  It's like one of those people  Protesting against Barbershop  And none of them had seen it  Yeah  It's like would you go see  What you're talking about  See what the context  Of the whole thing  The Rosa Parks line  Right  See what that's all about  Before you just get upset 
[02:50:30]  About taking that out of context  Jackass  Alright  Why don't we do  Bombs and Flubs Volume 2  We've been teasing this  For like two days  The listeners are getting  Kind of pissed off  Hazards of live radio  We screw up  Every so often  That's right  It's our blooper  Bloopers, bleeps  And blunders  It's our blooper segment  On the ONA program  The ONA virus  No I didn't get it  I could have turned his head  A little bit  I got that stupid  Harry real good  Did ya?  I was looking for a bathroom key  And he's in the hallway  Trying to see if the bathroom 
[02:51:00]  Doors open  And there's a woman  Walking away  And I just scream  Miss  And then close the door  She turns around  Looks at Harry  Like it's him  Oh and that dumbbell  Just kind of stand there  In his awful shorts  No it wasn't me  Yeah there's no way  To explain that  It's the worst  When that happens  Take a look up man  Alright bombs and flubs  Volume 2  This is Nathaniel's  Pretty much spearheading  This bit Anthony  Nathaniel is quite  The go getter  Here out of this crew  At least he's the one  You know I know  I know all of them  Work very hard  What are you talking about  Danny had the guitar riff  On the new 
[02:51:30]  Drew Boogie  Wow remix  Oh  He worked very hard  I'm supposed to be thrilled  That some guy  Probably smoking a little pot  Is playing some guitar  Great  Great  Wonderful  I'm saying  I know they all  Work very hard  Danny  Are you going to take that  He can't hear you  I know they work very hard  But Nathaniel  Wants everyone to know  How hard he's working  He comes in a lot  He's in this studio a lot  He brings his little pad  With notes on it  That just says working  He looks important always 
[02:52:00]  Yeah  It looks like he's  Working hard all the time  I like that  Well I mean  Even though I do  Put a lot of time  In these things  Occasionally I might make  A mistake in marking them  And Opie wants to know  Where this came from  Or what's going on here  Right  So I feel like  It slows the show down  If I have to write a note  Or I am  E-Rock  You know so  Where is E-Rock  Where the hell  Is E-Rock been  Where is he  What happened  He's doing something else  He's been out of this studio  The entire show today  Hopefully he's going 
[02:52:30]  Through a car wash  With his mouth open  Oh  Oh  Oh  God  Oh you bastard  Oh  Wow  That was perfect timing  He was walking  Right through the door  When you said that  And he couldn't hear  The replay quickly  You might want to  Listen to the replay  I can't even look at you  It's been  People  People are questioning  Where you have been  What are you doing  He comes in  He picks up some gum  And just throws  Three pieces in his mouth  Yeah what was that about  Where have you been  Who cares  Yeah the show is running 
[02:53:00]  Fine without you  Go back to whatever  You were doing  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  You're a horrid  You're a horrid man  Every once in a while  I get one out  You know  Anyway  Why would you  I'm not too  Like  Is it bad  Hmm  I sometimes dread  Coming in here  Why  And he sits right next to you 
[02:53:30]  That's the great thing  Yeah  I got an idea  I don't want to embarrass the kid  But I got an idea  What  You got a yeast infection  What do you got  I just got an idea  Yeah  Yeah  What is it  Is it one of those things  Like a show relator  Or are you just going to  Help him out with this idea  I'm just going to be  Sliding stuff to him  During the show  Oh is that what you're going to  It's going to look like notes  But it's going to be other things  Things written on Listerman strips  Just  Quick it's a secret  Destroy the evidence  You have to eat it  Yeah 
[02:54:00]  Anyway  Nathaniel is doing the  Bombs and flubs for the show  The guys are working on  Some other things too  I've been hearing  Yes  Something to do with farts  And maybe some other things  That they won't  Won't let on to yet  Let me also add  It was really a group effort  This time  A lot of people  Contributing the bombs and flubs  Without even accepting his award  He's thanking people already  Yeah  You're a fucking  Documentary of the Year winner  You know  I couldn't have done this alone 
[02:54:30]  Best foreign language film  Ugh  Well  Everybody  You know  Everybody's a credit whore  Around here  That is true  And  I'm exactly that way  In the booth  So  Yeah  Alright  Well without further ado  The evidence  How great is that  We got  Bombs and flubs  Volume 2  Glasgow and studio  We're going to get to your tech stuff  Because you came in with material right  I never get to half of it  I know  That's true  You come in with stuff  And we babble 
[02:55:00]  And you never get to it  Dude we never get to  You should see the stuff  We never get to  We should do a whole show someday  On the stuff we never got to  You should just outsource it  To another show  That's not a bad idea  Okay here we go  It's my birthday today  Your birthday was fucking yesterday  I listened to the show  Thank you  Yeah Jimmy  You can't claim two birthdays  How was Ozfest?  I'll talk about it later  Yeah that we have to get  We have to get to that  Yeah we're supposed to get to that as well  Alright let's get through bombs and flubs  Then we'll do Laszlo  And Jimmy's experience at Ozfest  Yes  And then I think that would wrap up a very fine show 
[02:55:30]  Today is really flying by  I gotta say  Yeah  Yesterday  Oof  A little clock watching going on there yesterday  A little rough  Stars at 7-10  I looked up  Yeah about 7-15  I went  I thought it was 10 by now  And Jimmy just bails  Jimmy left  Jimmy reached down  Pulled a handle between his seat  The roof opened up  And he popped right out with a parachute  I had to dude  I knew the best birthday ever was coming  Yeah  Alright we'll get into that in a few minutes  Okay Oof  Let's get through bombs and flubs 
[02:56:00]  Today we're going to start with flubs Anthony  A little different  Now why don't we explain  What the difference between a bomb and a flub is  A flub is when we're speaking  And the words just come out twisted  You mean to say one word  For some reason  A totally different word pops out of your face  And the very sympathetic crowd that we hang out with here in the studio  Doesn't just let it slide  They point it out and laugh at you  The bomb is what just happened to Ben earlier in the program  You say something you think might get a reaction 
[02:56:30]  A little chuckle  And it gets nothing  Right  And you bombed  And these guys are trying to come up with other ideas  Categories  Categories and stuff  I have one that might work  Just as simple as this  Line of the day  Line of the day  Because every day there's just that one line  That just blows you away  Like the line about the Parkinson's that you did  I heard that on the replay all weekend long  I laughed harder every time I heard it  90 pound lead hat 
[02:57:00]  Pick yours Parkinson  That one's a good one  Line of the day  And just start collecting the lines of the day  The ones that are just over the top home runs  I think it's funny that Ope mentions line of the day  After he just  Of course  Of course  He's called me on  I knew there was some kind of motive there  Because now I know I could be part of that bit  Please  I'll have one out of the 30  That was a two run home run off the upper deck  Line of the day though  Line of the day 
[02:57:30]  Line of the day  By guys in the studio  Whose name starts with a G  Glenn Hughes  Alright  Here we go  Let's start with Flubs  Bombs and Flubs Volume 2  The first one is from  Old Jimmy Norton  You mind your fucking business  Especially when it concerns me and Liddy  Concerns me  Concerns  Hey watch out  This concerns me  Concerns  Oh people also are requesting something for this  Yeah  I read the message boards  And people are requesting 
[02:58:00]  That you put a small beep tone  At the end of the clip  Because people don't know  When the clip is done  And when we're back commenting  On how funny the flub was  Hmm  You know  People have no idea  I'll do this  Can you do that over and over again  For today at least  Or do you get scared  Sometimes I get scared  Because scared  Loud noise  Startles make  Alright well  I'll do a bell  I can do this  Alright  Okay  Alright  There we go  And that means we're back live 
[02:58:30]  Yeah  Well how about this  When something bombs  And we laugh  And then we're laughing  Alright  I was going to say  But I'm ready to  End the next clip  Oh okay  Oh okay  Here we go  The next flub is from  We're back  I couldn't wait  You fucking asshole  I hate you all  The next flub is from  Anthony  Uh oh  Beyonce's ass is giant  She has a huge fat ass 
[02:59:00]  It's awful  But they  You know  Looks like she sat down  In a gravel driveway  Oh  It looks like two people  Sat on a gravel driveway  That is a giant ass  Each cheek of her ass  Is a normal person's ass cheek  It's massive  Full ass  It's great  Addition  Yeah  I said each cheek of her ass  Looks like a normal person's ass cheek  And then I said  A normal person's ass  I fucked up  That could go on the fuck up reel 
[02:59:30]  By the way  Because I did screw up  Bombs and flubs  Yes there we go  Now we're back to watching  Oh god  What a cold  Cold nose  I'm so happy  That you guys  You guys took our advice  And went back  Yeah  Really old show  Really far back  That one was from Thursday  Still hacking phlegm up  From that  It's very cold  Right  The recording is in the elevator  I can't believe that happened  Doom  Tomorrow  It's a mix  A mix 
[03:00:00]  A mix  Okay  Sure  The next flub is from  Jimmy Norton  The P volume of encyclopedias  In case you want to discuss  Filibusters  Exactly  Jimmy's getting pounded by the way  Why?  Because filibuster would be found  In the F encyclopedia  Oh I thought it was a P  And of course our listeners  Not letting you get away  With that one  And they absolutely shouldn't  I'm a P-H-U-C-K-I-N-G idiot 
[03:00:30]  That's very good  I didn't know either  Stupid bad spelling me  I sat there and went  Yeah exactly  That should be bombs  Yeah P-H section  Bombs  Flubs  And little phonetical errors  Spelling error  Alright the next one  We go back to Anthony  Oh the news shows  Do the same thing  We're doing here  Yeah I know  Yeah the pundits  They speculate  And people go  Oh well  Did you hear on the news?  Who does?  Who does? 
[03:01:00]  The pundits  The pundits do  Yeah  Cool  What did I say?  The pundits  It's not a pundit?  No  What is it?  It's a pundit  Pundit?  Pundit with a T  We all learned something new  On this program  Let me see  You're absolutely sure?  Yes  It's a pundit for years  No it's not a pundit  Sorry  Don't get so defensive about it  No I'm not  No it isn't  I can finally be right  You are right  Jesus let's all chill down  What?  Chill down  What?  Pundit  What is Dave Douglas doing here? 
[03:01:30]  Pundit  Good visual for the Boston crew around here  Alright here we go  You get it?  I stink  P-U-N-D-I-T  Yeah of course  Yeah you fucker  Jimmy  You really laid in to me  It wasn't even a nice way  I might laugh and chuckle  When you have a little flub  Or a little misstep there  But you were like  Yeah no  No it isn't  It was so satisfying  Yes  Yes it is  I go really? 
[03:02:00]  It's that way  Yes it is  Don't question me  Because it's rare that it happens  And I just wanted to savor victory  I can't believe I went through that long of a life  With saying that that way  Isn't it a picky one though?  Pundit  No that is just a legitimate  I've been fucking up that word  Yeah the word  It's pundit  Alright  And that one's over a month old  I just want to get in  Oh wow  Wow  Jesus  Jeez you must have to pull that off a reel to reel  Yeah  You find something with an old Ford after the slash  When I take the rest of the day off  Jesus  Holy crap 
[03:02:30]  It's like my ex-girlfriend and I were talking one time  And she was saying pontificate  Meant to think deeply  And I'm like stupid  No it doesn't  It means to preach  Yeah  She's like no no  I'm pontificating me  I'm in deep thought  No  Satisfaction at that pompous ass  Did you punch her in the face?  No no I just ate her ass for a few minutes  You showed her  I straightened her out  Jerked off all over my floor  Old professor butterscotch teaching her  Say it again 
[03:03:00]  Now I'm pontificating  She's like you're speaking  I'm like no I'm catching hepatitis from you  That's what pontificating means  Alright the next flub is from Jim Norton  We'd be in the car with Florentine  He would fart  I swear to God  If me and him were in the cup  I would fart into a cup  And hand it to him  And he would smell it  And go not bad  How did all of you fit in a cup?  What?  You said we were in the cup  Didn't I say we were in the car?  No you said you were all in the cup  I knew you were going  But I had to call you honest  I really am a zilch 
[03:03:30]  All in a cup  In the little teacups at Disney  Spinning around  I actually met an athletic supporter  Three of us were just hanging out  Inside of Ben's athletic supporter  Using him as a toboggan  Well you could  That was very good  That was kind of picky though  You kind of said cup  And then you said car  You said we were all hanging out in the cup  We have another one from Jimmy  That was from the dark ages  That was three weeks ago  I know  Is that it?  This happened at the end of the dragon wagon call 
[03:04:00]  Which is a very famous bit on the show  I will put you on my church's playlist  You do that  And then you should fucking hook it up to the church  I fucked that one up  You were rolling  You were rolling  Without an error for the whole time  That's alright  I just couldn't think of the jerk reference real quick  I guess we could skip number seven and go right to eight  I don't want to skip seven 
[03:04:30]  I like doing seven  Seven is brutal  Jerry Lee Lewis from Whackbag  He learned Anthony can't be harmed by Master Poe  Because he's an eighteen sorcerer  Who can conjure up large balls of Steve  Yeah, conjure, I know  Shut up  Conjure  He's already to pound  Shut up  Yeah, he  Because I was laughing  I couldn't even say the word  Good thing in French you'd say hello like bonjour  Bonjour  Conjure  That's a good one 
[03:05:00]  Alright, back to Jimmy  This elixir will grow hair and cure the vapors  Alright  Well, Patty, we don't have anything for you today  So thanks for coming  It heals Kamutol  This thing  I couldn't think of the word elixir  That was a visual flub  I went to ring the bell and I dinged my mouse  Wow  I just slapped the top of my mouse 
[03:05:30]  What a complete ass  And it opens your hidden window  And it's the guy being fucked by the horse  I always keep the sexy pictures behind the browser  What an idiot  Alright  Let me double click this  Finally, the last stink  The last flub  Put another log on the Steve  Chest thing  I was going to sing 
[03:06:00]  Chestnuts roasting  By Steve Sweet  But of course  You're so eager to get it all out in one word  Chestnuts roasting  Chest thing  Chest thing to fire  Fat neck, little thin lips  Oh, so eager to please  Old Komodo dragon torso  Just shut up  Stop the pain  That's a really good one  Lovey, there's a dragon 
[03:06:30]  And is it ironic that someone said logs  And I blurted out chest  I love this bit  Very good  Bombs and flubs volume 2  Put more bombs in there though  That was great  But they're mostly flubs  No, I started with just flubs  Those are all flubs  That's another thing  Jimmy  I didn't know that  That's another thing they're keeping track of  By the way  What?  When we're not listening  Yeah  Oh, no, I just didn't know that that was what  Okay  Well, now we're going to do the bombs  Those are all flubs  Now we have all bombs  And Nathaniel's smart  He knows that the bombs are stronger than the flubs, right? 
[03:07:00]  Even though it's called bombs and flubs  He started with flubs  Knowing that if you end with the strong stuff  Which in this case would be the bombs  At least I didn't say put more flubs in  At least I knew that they were  They were bombs  I sure did  Alright, here's the first bomb  P-H-L-U-B-S  Here's Jimmy bombing, believe it or not  On the Opie and Anthony show  I don't believe it  You were talking about how your goal is to just live in bed and stuff  Yeah, sure  And I had audio actually from your bathroom  Oh, really?  From your bedroom?  A bedroom, bathroom  If I could make that the same room  Some room with a B 
[03:07:30]  That would be better  The bitchin'  See?  Bitchin' kitchen  Oh, you  My body can't move  Clearly that was mislabeled  Because that was an Anthony bomb  Right, that's an Anthony bomb  How about bombs, flubs, and mislabels  Which leads to firings?  Is that with a P-H?  Yes, when I said which leads to firings  Instead of which lead  But we all understand  And I wasn't even listening  What was the bomb in that?  Go ahead, Anthony  Sorry that I didn't make you repeat it  But I swear to God  I wasn't listening on that one  I don't know  It's just some awful reference to a room 
[03:08:00]  That starts with a B  And I said bitchin'  Oh, you should bitchin'  That would be a kitchen with a B  Because isn't that wacky?  It's a kitchen with a B  Ha ha  That was bawful  Now I'm concerned about the rest of the labels  Uh-oh  Damn it  Is this like a chain reaction?  The first one's off  Yeah, because that one says  Jim bombing by saying  Hey, Judea  Oh, yeah  Oh, no  Oh, boy  I don't believe that I might have bombs  I think they just removed the laugh in post  Right  Here's someone from our show, Bombing 
[03:08:30]  I'm not even going to follow the cue sheet anymore  You know what I'm thinking about  When kids learn to speak  It's like the hardest thing in the world  Ever watch like Telemundo for a half hour  Like you force yourself to try to figure out  What the hell they're saying?  Yep  That's what it's like to be one  How much car crash?  I hope he gave you the crickets  I like this one, actually  Our good friend Jay Moore bombing 
[03:09:00]  Yes  Yes  I don't know  I think he should have got something for that  Yeah  That was kind of a good line, I thought  It was just great to wait  I bet you none of us were listening  And that was the problem  It was just  When it's on the phone  And it lays there  And there's silence in the studio  You're just like  The next bomb  I think it might be Jimmy's  Yeah, we never made it to the moon  We never did it  That's a bunch of bullshit  With the C-Rock  The C-Rock  Because the flag  You could tell it was like  Blown in the wind or something  There was some kind of gravity thing happening  And there was also like a weird M in the back  Yeah  Which was serving burgers 
[03:09:30]  Did you ever hear Cronkite screw it up?  Wow  Jesus  Oh  That was  That was mine  Don't blame me for that clunker  I almost bailed you out  Yep  When it's a Cronkite  Oof  That was a brutal one  That could be bombing in the not listening segment  All in one  Yeah  All in one  There's a lot of not listening happening  That bomb's so bad though  You didn't even recognize that humor had been attempted  Alright here's Anthony Bauman 
[03:10:00]  And also I think Phil Collins actually did a session or two  He always tells the story  He goes  He sat in on a session  He said he wanted to play drums  But obviously  Jimmy Bauman  They played  Hey Juju Judea  I like it  That wasn't bad  I enjoyed it  Nathaniel made me do that  Yeah  It's gotta be marked  Oh now he's got a little  That fucker's just standing there with his pen 
[03:10:30]  I know  Now with his pen waiting for us to fuck up  This is why Nathaniel stinks  Because he doesn't want to  He's lazy  He doesn't want to go back over the old ones  So he's like  I'll just get all the new ones  Yeah new ones  He's already got five from today  Of course he does  He'll make believe he found them months ago  He wants to know if he could use the flubs  That we've used during the flubs segment  Because it's a new segment now  Yes  So he's just gonna replay those  Alright here's the Kaplan Brothers  Double bomb  That wasn't even a crash  That was a sputter and running of gas 
[03:11:00]  Oh okay  There you have it  A bomb within a bomb  Yeah  Wow very good  My Beatles one  Shouldn't have gotten a car crash  You should have gotten a gunshot  And a brain tumor  Cronkite  That's a good one  Alright  It's kind of like the Cronkite Watergate scandal  Mark that one fan  Asterisk  Asterisk  In case you need a little reference  That's a flomb  I bet you bomb it a flub 
[03:11:30]  How come the actual flub is barely there?  Didn't I say Cronkite?  That's sort of what you were making fun of me about  I was using the bomb from the bomb segment  Oh okay  I didn't even hear me say Cronkite  But he said Cronkite  He said Cronkite?  That was the  Who said Cronkite?  Oh god  His flub was Cronkite  And you were making fun of him  And then he tried to recover with a joke  I don't even listen to myself  There's  Well  There's gonna be the ultimate coming up  Oh okay  This one's good?  I hope so  It's the last one? 
[03:12:00]  It's a little long  That's why I'm a little nervous  No  This one should work  Alright  The final bomb  And the bombs and flubs  Volume 2 segment  Alright  Here it is  A quick clip here  Virginia Graham  Anyone know who Virginia Graham is?  Yes  But I don't want to spoil it  She was a dancer wasn't she?  Virginia Graham  She was the son of a cracker mobile?  Virginia Graham  I think she was one of these  Well we know the clip  But she obviously worked with  Invented a cracker?  She obviously worked with Mike Wallace  I just did a cracker joke that bombed 
[03:12:30]  You did?  Yeah I said she was the daughter of a cracker mogul  I didn't even listen to you  That's how bad  That's how badly we listened  Mike  Mike  That's a pile of on the cracker highway  Mike  My cracker joke bombed  Then he leaped into the cracker pool  You know what?  That was like  You stuck your head up and got shot  And I just went  What happened?  Shot my head up  You know  What an idiot  I gotta point out  Ever since we acknowledged 
[03:13:00]  That we don't listen to each other  It makes listening to the replay  So much fucking fun  I can't wait to hear me  Bomb  Bomb with the same cracker joke  But I might have even said  She was the son of a cracker mogul  I might have bombed on every level  But it just got  Not only did it bomb  Nobody acknowledged  That a person had spoken  I wasn't listening to you  I would have laughed at that  Obviously  Because I felt  Enough confidence  In the cracker joke  To use it myself  Oh the famous cracker line  Yes  I did say son 
[03:13:30]  Didn't I?  Yeah  Yeah  It was a girl  And you said son of a cracker mogul  I was  You know my head is just  Churning away  Trying to come up with something funny  And the cracker joke came out  I wasn't listening to Jimmy  And I will say  That's the first time  I ever made a gender mistake  Without cash being exchanged  Bravo  There you have it  Bombs and flubs  Very good Nathan  Bombs, flubs and  Jimmy  How do you talk on that microphone  After blowing ass on it?

It was your audition  Oh, I don't care  I'll babble about anything  While you tour  It was fine  It doesn't matter to me  It was hot  We were going to just  Take the rest of the day off  And see what you would do  That would have been cool  You just not come back  Why not?  You talk more about  Your broken fan  On your computer  Right  We did that one time  Remember we just like 
[03:16:30]  We all decided to leave  On a guest  Walked out of the studio  And the guest was just  Sitting there  Was it Steve the Whistler?  It was  Was it?  Why haven't we had  Bad guest day  In a long time?  How about we have  Guest day?  Just start with guest day  Wednesdays is any guest day  How about a guest  That's not one of our friends?  Let's start there  We're like crying  For a guest like  Cindy Williams these days  Wouldn't that be great?  I worked on a guest yesterday  You did?  I certainly did  I think I got somebody  Who will do  Who will actually 
[03:17:00]  Either do a phone  Or come in when he can  And who would that be Jimmy?  Oh, Bill Ward  Oh  Wow  Hey  Were you hobnobbing yesterday?  I was backstage at Ozzfest  Backstage at Ozzfest  For his little birthday  As happy as I've ever been  And me and Florentine  Are walking around  And Jim comes over  And he goes  Dude, Bill Ward's  On his drum riser  And I'm like  Let's go look at Bill Ward  So we're standing  Five feet from Bill Ward  Forty minutes 
[03:17:30]  He's like warming up  Or waiting for a picture  And the people  Are just walking up to him  Talking to him  So Jim's like  Let's just walk up to him  So we walk up to the drum riser  And he's like  Bill, can we get a picture?  And he's like  Yeah  He's like the greatest guy ever  So he stands up  Of course I run up  He brings me behind  On the drum set  I'm on Sabbath stage  Stop  It's like three in the afternoon  I'm standing in his drum set  We do a picture  And I start talking about  Satellite radio  And he's really interested in it  And so he said  That he would come on the show  And he was very sincere  No, we talked for like  Probably 15 minutes 
[03:18:00]  About Satellite radio  And how bad commercial radio is  And he's got his own show  And I think he should get a show  On the Boneyard  That's just me  That's just you  But this is how  Jim and Jim Florentine  Were backstage  At Babe Fest  With Gene Simmons  Both just sort of  Standing real close to each other  Nervously fingering  Their digital cameras  Ready to pounce  Oh yeah  Because that's what  It's all about with Jimmy  Is getting the pictures  Well dude, I had to  I mean once you get Bill Ward  And then you get a picture  With Geezer Butler  And then you get a picture  With Tony Iommi  Tony Iommi?  When you realize 
[03:18:30]  And then Ozzy walks by  And you say hello real quick  You don't get to talk to him  But on your birthday  When you get to talk  To every member of Black Sabbath  You really have a wonderful  Wonderful birthday  That's a perfect birthday  Oh my goodness  And you were saying  How you hate birthdays yesterday  That was the best birthday  I've ever had  Bestest birthday ever  For Jimmy  Bruce Dickinson  Iron Maiden  Got him  I got everybody I wanted  It was fantastic  Wow  I annoyed Geezer  And I annoyed Iommi  You're dead?

[03:21:30]  Come on  That would be cool  I would love to have  Bill in studio  Chit chatting  Let's go to the phone  And say hi to Johnny B  Wow  What a day  I was so happy  What's up Johnny  What's up Laz  Happy belated birthday Jimmy  Thank you mister  I just had a question  For Lazlo  Lazlo what's coming down  The pike as far as  MP3 players  Is Dell coming out  With like a  Flash memory player  I think Dell  Might already have one  The big rumor right now  Is that Apple might  Do a video iPod  Yeah I've heard about that  So that not only  You know now you can 
[03:22:00]  Pay two bucks  And you get to watch  You know a postage  Stamp size  The thing of Jay-Z  Fronting and  Fronting  But I mean I would  Stick with the iPod family  I know that Jimmy  Hates them but  I would  I'd stick with them  I don't hate them  It is a very convenient  Design  I like it  I don't agree with that  At all  No  I've been using an  I-River piece for the  Past year and a half  That never gave me  Problems  Really  And that's all I do  Is pick up  And drop off  Broken iPods

[03:24:00]  To the other people  There's less latency  They say the worst latency  Is like 60 milliseconds  Which is noticeable  Yeah  But you can set up rooms  And reserve seats  You know  For your musician friends  And then you can  Designate a seat  That you need a saxophone player  And if they suck  You just hit the dump button  And they get kicked out  The easy way  No band politics  Just throw them right out  Right  Wow that's pretty cool  Yeah it's cool  It's at e-jamming.com  They're signing people up 
[03:24:30]  For the beta right now  So it's going to be  Like 20 bucks a month  And all those lonely musicians  Living in the middle of nowhere  Can get together with other people  So like the same thing  As an online gaming platform  Where you go online  And play games with other people  Now you're plugging your instrument in  And actually playing  With other live people online  Right  And I'd love to just be  A fly on the wall  And listen to you know  Imagine a real band  Gets into it  Imagine a real band  Gets into it  Just as a goof  Like Metallica plugs in  Metallica you too  And they tell Adam or something 
[03:25:00]  Or Edge to take the day off  And they're going to make believe  They're like some kind of  YouTube cover band  Actually playing with you too  And you don't know  You have no idea  I was playing with this guy  Last night Paul Hewson  What a voice box on that guy  You know how these bands  Get bored  That would be a great thing  To do on the road  And then you know  You know  Show it off on a website somewhere  Yeah  They think it's a cover band  Showing up  And then the real YouTube  Walks into a bar  Like 200 people  That's going to be funny too  No they'd have to have a video  You know they'd have to  Videotape it  Yeah  Because everything YouTube does  They have to like videotape  Them running around Manhattan 
[03:25:30]  Of course  And also on chat rooms  They're shutting down  Chat rooms in Australia  They have chat rooms  On mobile phones  And the teens  Are really into it  Yeah  And people  Right  And so are the pedophiles  Correct  And there's been  Happy hunting grounds  There was a 23 year old man  Picked up a 13 year old girl  Oh  And so they shut down  All the mobile chat rooms  And  Because of one pedophile  Because of one guy  Having fun  Pedophile  It's his personal taste  Yeah why don't you stop  Being so judgmental 
[03:26:00]  Right  Guy wants to make friends  Right  Back in the 1300s  That would have been  Completely acceptable  Right  Absolutely  He'd be dead by 25 anyway  Damn this longer  Life expectancy  And by the way  That's hogwash  What  Oh easy  You ever go through  A graveyard  And you see the old tombstones  They were living  Quite nicely  They were  I've heard  Ever since I can remember  That they only lived  To like 35  Life expectancy  Was you know  Yeah  25  If you've ever been  To a graveyard  You see the tombstones  1620 to 1705 
[03:26:30]  I thought they were  Supposed to only live  30 years or so  Those are the rich people  That could afford tombstones  The rest that died at 25  Got dumped in the river  Put them in the plague pits  Alright good point  Dumped them in there  Oh and Anthony  I was thinking  They're launching a new service  On Long Island  For people that are  Internet speed junkies  Yeah  And have a little extra dough  I've heard about this too  You get a direct fiber optic line  To your house  Yeah  Right to your house  Fiber optic  Now you're talking speeds 
[03:27:00]  That are  How many times faster than  Cable  Ten times faster than cable  Ten times faster than cable  They said you can download  A movie in six minutes  Yep  Which is what it's always about  That is absolutely  What it's about  That's like  I was talking to the  Verizon guy last week  And it's like  You know what's this good for  It's like download movies  Yeah  You know  Episode one in six minutes  How much is it to do that  I don't know what the pricing is  It's not as bad as you would  Think it is  It really isn't  Because I was looking into it  Of course you were  I'm actually looking into it 
[03:27:30]  I love the speed  I'm getting cable soon  Yeah  For my cable hook up  I think Thursday  Or whatever  Maybe it's available in your area  Oh okay  I want to get it  Optimum  I have an optimum online  Well and the other thing  See the thing about cable  That a lot of people don't know  Is that if you have the right software  You can sniff what everybody else is doing  In your neighborhood  Like what they're viewing on the internet  With  Through their wireless network  No through cable  Through cable  Right  Oh right  Yeah yeah  Because cable is shared broadband  It's pretty much a huge network 
[03:28:00]  In your neighborhood  It's a huge pipe  That everybody in the neighborhood is sharing  Yeah  And the  You know  Your box  Your cable box  Basically filters out  What everybody else is doing  And it only  Shows you your traffic  Right  But you can make a few alterations  And maybe see what Anthony's poking around on  See what I'm poking around  You'd be pretty bored  10 o'clock at night  You'd be pretty bored  A lot of gaming stuff  A lot of 3D modeling stuff  Can you do that also with Satellite 2 or no?  With Satellite 1  Probably  With like Direct TV 
[03:28:30]  What's the other one?  I used to have  I didn't have cable  What's the other one?  DSL  DSL  Yeah  I don't know if you  I don't think you can do it with DSL  You know what I love about  Especially with cable speed  You ever see the Optimum online commercials  Where they have a guy  And he's talking about  How he found his long lost brother  Through using the search engines  And that it's  He was kind of saying that  Optimum online  And the speed of the cable  Helped him find his brother  And you kind of get the message that 
[03:29:00]  Because he had dial-up before  Finding his brother  Wasn't worth waiting for the dial-up  That is completely what I take away  From this commercial  He's like  Yeah well I used to have a slow connection  And I got Optimum online  And it opened me up to the speed of the internet  And now I was able to find my brother  Like he was trying a few times to dial up  This is too slow  This motherfucker ain't worth it  Click  I'm going out  I got this email the other day  That said  You know 
[03:29:30]  Is there  It was like a spam  Is there a sex offender  In your neighborhood  And so  It was just  You know  A stupid service  But there's  The National Registry  Of Sex Offenders  Yeah  So as a hoot  I went to it  And typed in my zip code  And  Boop  There pops up  All the sex offenders  Pictures of them  What they did  Wow how many  And then  There was only like  Two or three  Two or three  Within a few block radius  Ooh I'm scared 
[03:30:00]  But what you can do  Is you can  Then type their name  Into Google  And then your zip code  And their phone numbers  Pop up  Ooh  Yeah  So if you're bored  And want to hook up  With a sex offender  Talk to a few sex offenders  If there's any chick  That was like arrested  For just blowing guys  With crew cuts  You're going to come  In my mouth  Or I'll shoot you  Give that gal a ring  You know what  Is happening  I noticed the other day  It's kind of a new thing  But I noticed  It's very fucking annoying  Search engine 
[03:30:30]  You go into Yahoo or Google  You type in what you want  And a thing comes up  You click on the link  And it takes you  To another search engine  That  Like say you're looking for  Pat Battle  Pat Battle  See I can play along  You put Pat Battle  In the search engine  And then a link comes up  And it says Pat Battle  And you click on that  And all of a sudden  It'll say  Looking to buy  Pat Battle online  eBay links to Pat Battle 
[03:31:00]  Right  And you get a whole thing  It's not  It was a search engine  That didn't take you  To what you want to see  It took you  To another fucking search engine  It takes you to  Nigerian eBay  Where you can bid on  Yeah  Pat Battle  Yeah  Or it takes you  To the internet in 1720  Looking to buy  Pat Battle  Click here to check her teeth  Oh my god  Alright Drew's laughing  We're okay  We're okay  Drew's laughing  Jesus  God damn  That's funny 
[03:31:30]  That's horrid  Hey I got a question  For Laszlo  Everyone wants to know  About phones  Phones  Phones  Phones  Phones  Phones  Are they buying  The right phone  Should they wait  Blah blah blah  What do you got on phones  What the new mobile phones  That are coming  MP3 players  Better picture taking  What's the deal  Well you're going to  Have like two  There's already  Two megapixel phones  Hitting the market  And the ones that do  Video  Which is always good  Because there's already  People taking pictures  Of other people  Doing illegal stuff  And sending it off 
[03:32:00]  To the cops  Which is  Great to turn us  Into a big  Narc culture  But some of the  New mobile phones  That I saw  At the big  Electronics fest  In Germany  Mostly everybody's  Trying to turn  Into a Blackberry  Is what they're  Going after  That and  And I think  They're going to  Go after the  iPod market  I don't know  If people  Want to have  That much  Junk in their  Phone  Because what  Tends to happen  Is it  It'll be a  Great camera  But it sounds  Like shit  Right  The phone  Doesn't work  Well  Or it'll be 
[03:32:30]  A decent  MP3 player  But the camera  Stinks  So  I think we  Got to wait  A little while  I had the trio  And I got  You know  I don't know  What they do  With XM  But I got  To tell you  I hated the phone  Loved the  The rest of  What the trio  Gave me  But the actual  Phone  I've heard  Nothing but  Horror stories  About the trio  And then when  I tried to  Talk to  Straylo  On that  Stupid thing  Yeah  Straylo would  Call us  On his trio  And it was  Awful low  Right  Sounds like  Somebody's got  Like a dog  Whistle in the  Background 
[03:33:00]  Or something  Just like  This high  Very tinny  It gave me  A great excuse  To hang up  On them  So I was  Happy about  That  Well you know  Mobile phones  Actually sounded  Better  Ten years ago  Now that they've  Gone digital  They've got like  That tiny slice  Of bandwidth  And everything  Sounds awful  Whereas before  When it's sort of  Analog  You know  A warmer sound  So the difference  Between like  Vinyl and you know  Like an mp3 
[03:33:30]  That's at 56 kilobits  Yeah  It's just  I mean they sound  Awful  It is really hard  To get a phone  That really sounds  Good and the  Volume is good  Because the  The worst is when  Your volume's down  Low and you  Have to turn it up  Because that  Quality  That bad phone  Quality  Loud  Hurts your  Freaking ears  They won't let  What Sean  What seems to be  The problem  Oh wow  Look at that  Hey Sean  No I was just  Complaining about  How you guys  Weren't going to  Put me on  But I guess you  Did  Stop bitching  Yeah I know  I am  I was going to

[03:38:00]  The mother gave  Her sons  Alcohol  The court heard  As the night  Wound on  Everyone went to bed  Except the woman  And one son  He and his mother  Began a conversation  About his girlfriend  Which turned  To sexual matters  The two embraced  Removed their clothes  And sexual intercourse  Followed  The next day  They discussed  What happened  Decided it was wrong  And that it would  Never happen again  That's so dirty  On March 12th  The two boys  Were visiting the mother  Once more  Alcohol again  In the scene

That's about it  Just one thing  That there's a  The UN is now looking to  Maybe take over  The structural body  That controls the internet  So  Oh no  Are you kidding? 
[03:41:00]  Syria, Brazil, China  And other places  Where you can get thrown into prison  For publishing a newspaper  Yeah  Are upset that the internet  Has so much unregulated filth  On it  So they want to take over  ICANN  Which is the internet corporation  For assigned names and numbers  And put some regulations in place  There really isn't  I don't see that there are  Any real regulations  On the internet  That can be  You can't really regulate it  It is worldwide  And  The only 
[03:41:30]  I could see them thinking  That the UN would be perfect  Because it's an international body  You could bring all them in  To legislate things  And have the countries  Cooperating with  What goes on it  And what's allowed  Well if they control things  At the root level  You know countries  Could  Like China could  If they had root level  They could just disallow  Anything political  From the United States  Coming in  Coming in  Or anything from the dot  Could they really?  Yeah  If they have root level access  Yeah  To the way that  What if someone in China  Decides they're going to  Dial up somewhere 
[03:42:00]  And go through another country  Perhaps to get in  Wouldn't there be other ways  Of getting in  And getting in  Well China regulates  The internet now  I mean you can't get to  Political news sites  You can't  You can't do it  Or they'll chop your hands off  If you  No you can't  You can't access it  They're controlling that  At the server level  At the dial ups  And the internet service providers  I mean this is a country  That like went in  And shut down a bunch  Of their internet cafes  Because people were  You know playing too much  You know head to head 
[03:42:30]  Video games with people  In other countries  And then you know  Maybe get into  Conversation about politics  That is an awful place  Hey can you get your hands  Chopped off  For saying the wrong thing  In public  No not over here  How we even deal  With that country  On a level like  They're actually civil  I like it  They keep the ladies in line  Yeah  Wrap their feet up real tight  Not a bunch of screaming brats  You get one  The second one  In the river  Little river of babies  My response to that
