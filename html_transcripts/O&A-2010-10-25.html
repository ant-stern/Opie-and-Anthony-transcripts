<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts griping about Mondays and reminiscing about a *Back to the Future* screening, comparing the audience to their own listeners and pointing out details only visible on a big screen. They speculated on Doc Brown's disappointment with the 2000s' technological advancements.  A review of *Jackass 3D* followed, praising its stunts and humor, especially Johnny Knoxville's resilience, and sparking a debate about censorship of genitalia.  The UFC fight between Brock Lesnar and Cain Velasquez was extensively analyzed, including Lesnar's performance and comparisons to other fighters like Shane Carwin and Tito Ortiz.  The show then covered a bizarre interaction between Lesnar and The Undertaker at a UFC event, questioning whether it was genuine or a publicity stunt. This led to a discussion of Linda McMahon's political campaign and the controversy surrounding banned WWE apparel at polling stations. The segment ended with observations on classic Hollywood acting styles and further *Jackass 3D* commentary, including a brief clip of Rich Voss and Bonnie McFarland from TMZ.

The next segment began with a discussion of Orson Welles' work, transitioning to a critique of a David Learner commercial featuring Shakespearean quotes.  Brett Favre's leaked voicemails and career were analyzed, followed by several "feel-good" sports stories about disabled athletes.  A blind high school football play-by-play announcer and his spotter appeared in-studio. A lengthy, sarcastic takedown of radio hosts John and Jeff's segment followed, criticizing their perceived lack of energy and excessive filler. The hosts discussed the rise of unmarried couples, attributing it partly to economic factors, and included a caller frustrated with the John and Jeff segment and further commentary on their lack of caller interaction.  The Fox/Cablevision dispute was discussed, alongside a "jocktober" segment with a mystery guest and a third-shift trivia segment focusing on average American time spent on various activities.  The hosts' candy consumption, Anthony Weiner's stance on YouTube and terrorist videos, and a caller's show quality comments were also included. The segment concluded with a humorous, extended discussion about the difficulties of removing a soiled condom, leading back to speculation about the third-shift trivia answer, ultimately revealed as "waiting in line."

The show then tackled a Long Island landlord arrested for sexually abusing his tenant's 2-year-old Shiba Inu, "Snowball," detailing graphic sexual descriptions of the alleged act and criticizing the low bail.  The trivia question about average American time spent on an activity was repeated, with incorrect guesses (including "fighting erections at a daycare center") before the correct answer ("looking for lost keys") was given. This segment included numerous off-color jokes and tangents.  A news segment criticizing Opie and Anthony's use of offensive language was discussed, leading to a heated debate with the hosts harshly criticizing the commentator and the broader movement for perceived censorship and political correctness.  A clip of Patrice O'Neal confronting the commentator was played and discussed at length, with the hosts expressing support for O'Neal.  The final segment included personal anecdotes about juicing, upcoming guests (Carrie Byron from Mythbusters and an Ice Road Trucker), upcoming 3D movies, and a discussion of hysterectomies and their effects on women, interlaced with crude humor.  The segment concluded with an Andy Rooney segment containing jokes about hysterectomies.

The final segment began with the discussion of a submitted amateur sex video, with explicit audio from the video played and descriptions focusing on the participantsâ€™ apparent age difference and the woman's possible profession. The conversation shifted to the death of a dwarf former classmate who achieved significant success, including graduating from Harvard Law and advising Presidents Clinton and Obama.  This transitioned to a discussion of Sean Stevenson, a motivational speaker in a wheelchair, and a screening of one of his viral dance videos.  The show then featured a clip of Nick Vujicic, a motivational speaker born without limbs, with commentary on his motivational speech and overcoming physical challenges.  The hosts continued to comment on Vujicic's performance as the segment concluded.

[00:04:00]  doesn't matter when you see it in that context and because it was a movie theater too with a big  big fucking screen yeah like i don't like when they show oh look we're bringing it back to movie  to the theater and it's on a shitty little screen that sucks this was a big screen a digital copy  it was clear uh sound was great and amazingly enough you pick up little fucking details that 
[00:04:30]  you don't see on tv like what that there are other dorks yes that there are other geeky nerdy dorks  it was all it looked like our audience the whole the whole audience was any road show we've ever done  it was kind of goofy guys and they're not too attractive girlfriends not a lot of hot chicks  no where are the hot chicks no i don't know where the hot chicks were but they weren't in fact in the  future hopefully they're going to the show tonight you're going again hell yeah i'm going again because 
[00:05:00]  tonight is the the anniversary so of when marty actually went so right into the past yes you see  because it was october 25th 1985 so now you can go and watch back to the future 25 years to the  day of when marty took his big adventure through time yes and when doc says at the beginning that  he's going to go 25 years in the future to see what life is like beyond his years this is the exact 
[00:05:30]  day he would have popped in if the libyans had today today today today was his big escape somewhere  in a in a mall parking lot doc brown was supposed to wipe his brow and go i've i got rid of the  terrorists yes i've escaped them i've escaped i am now 25 years in the future and he would have  been gravely disappointed i think he would have been like i expected a little more why don't we  have no crazy yellow suit or the mirror glasses and nothing crazy we're still mr fusion there's no 
[00:06:00]  mr fusion mr fusion we're still just walking around he could see a delorean just driving around  nothing different well i guess my weekend's gonna continue let me know when this is over  why don't we go back to 85 and see what the big shit was you know going on the big shit that was  going on to see how much we have actually advanced in the last 25 years i think all of us are going  to be gravely disappointed computing huge computing and obviously cell phones that's about it the cars 
[00:06:30]  are pretty much exactly the same cars they look different but they always do every year they've  looked you know they don't really look that much different in 1990 85 in 1990 if you looked at the  cars and thought about those cars in 1985 you'd be like wow that's the future and now you look at  them and they're old cars uh that's exactly what what happens every year with cars so you can't even  deal with that part of it so he would have just been gravely disappointed he'd have thought his  machine didn't work he'd have he'd have still been in that mall parking lot true going wait wait 
[00:07:00]  why is there still jc pennies here there should be a uh fucking a space dock or something oh and we  could go to like better places to get our coffee i think that's about it coffee in the last 25 years  if you think about it the trains are still the same the buses are still the same the pitches are still  the same yeah everything is still the same coca-cola is still the same yeah that's when they switched  over to the who is probably doing their first farewell tour they're still fucking performing nothing 
[00:07:30]  changes ever no no he would have been disappointed he would have been very upset he would have been  like now i got to go like a hundred years in the future yeah were there any schwuggies at the movie  theater one mayor goldie wilson fan oh really was there i say that because i think that's what  turns you off uh to movie theaters that the schwuggies you know bothered you to a point you decide not  to go to movie theaters anymore i don't really like using that language um but i will say there 
[00:08:00]  is a certain element that go to certain movies that do ruin the movie watching experience that did  not happen during back to the future uh it was a very um very safe crowd predictable crowd let's say  and there were about i don't know eight deloreans out front no yes yes deloreans and danny made a great  observation i hope the traffic cops fucking had them well when you listen when you're a part of the 
[00:08:30]  long island delorean owners yes yes you show up to these you show up to these things you don't have  a lot of events to go to so people were taking pictures with the deloreans and then and then  there was one guy who had kind of some fins on the back and and he had something that looked like a  spaghetti colander and and a kool-aid pitcher on top to look like the mr fusion thing it was  like and danny just looks he goes either do it or don't do it like it was like painted plywood 
[00:09:00]  for those rear those rear fins yeah yeah it looked so fucking it looked lame like if you're gonna do  it then do it up like the fucking movie car or just have a delorean spend the six thousand dollars or  don't touch the car that's it it's one or the other there's no in between i can think of a great  place for a fire tonight a great entrance like the happy land social club jesus that movie sucks  the only people love it it's endearing the only time the only movie i went to go see when it went 
[00:09:30]  back into theaters was et yeah a few years ago well if a few it's probably like seven eight years ago now  they brought that back into movie theaters and then to see they replaced the guns with walkie talkies  and i'm like all right i'm never doing this again that was spielberg's request actually he won i think  it was drew barrymore's oh he has a lot of power and she's she's not a gun girl man so let's replace  all the guns in the original movie with walkie talkies it was enraging it's like whatever your 
[00:10:00]  political views why don't you just leave the shit that already happened alone at least i uh i was glad  that changed uh history as well i was glad they didn't change anything and back to it they didn't  change anything that's good enough no because uh uh there was one one part and it's amazing how  uncomfortable wait wait those are the delorians parked out front of the movie theater yeah wow  there's there's tens of no well actually there's nobody around the delorians to check it out the  owners of the delorians that's about it well to be fair that was like five minutes before the show 
[00:10:30]  oh see everybody was everybody was actually in the theater those were futuristic looking back then  though aren't they yes they're not now they're not even close to futuristic horrid yeah  i would mind having one i don't have garage space they're pretty cheap these days how much  is a delorium yeah 40 grand well 40 that's like brand new you get made from actual parts yeah uh if  you want one that was on the road used you could probably pick one up for like 15 16 yeah how much  were they back then weren't you like a luxury car yeah it was like a sports car but it was gravely 
[00:11:00]  underpowered and it you know the guy that ran the company was on coke so all that money was going  into his nose uh the audience getting very nervous at certain uh parts they uh i knew they were going  to do that on snl they did it badly by the way yeah really who's the actor it looks like him that's  the guy that's uh that's what's his name fucking keenan keenan fucking yeah that's the black guy  keenan it's the fat black guy from snl yeah he looks just like him i mean it's great makeup it is 
[00:11:30]  it's easy to make a black guy up as him i mean you can take any black guy and put that white hair  on him it's gonna look like him uh very very uncomfortable when uh the part where they went  hey beat it spook oh really yeah like we we were the only ones that busted out laughing good for you  in the whole theater and then and then i heard one woman like off to the side go like something like  oh oh my oh my i forgot that was like yeah yeah oh oh boy beat it spook oh boy yeah how do i 
[00:12:00]  explain that to the children we were definitely the only three people who laughed at that line  good you should have right behind us oh my god oh my god really in the other part where the guy  at the uh diner goes yeah yeah that'll be the day a colored mayor and nobody it was like silence  everyone was afraid to to say anything at that point seeing the movie uh with a bunch of people  really uh just brings it all together how how much we've analyzed this movie because the three of 
[00:12:30]  us are just cracking up at stuff that no one else is laughing like doc's faces yeah or or at the end  when when the hell did this happen yeah when the hell did this happen why wasn't i told mr mcfly  mr mcfly think it's your new book like it's just little parts that are just dumb things right so  funny we're the only idiots just cackling hysterically i wish i could enjoy it that movie makes me nauseous  it's great you know there's gonna be a 3d version now oh god that'll keep the franchise alive they'll 
[00:13:00]  they'll turn into a 3d thing and put it back in theaters the big blu-ray release is tomorrow so  you go blu-ray and then you go 3d another year or so new video game is uh coming out oh it's all  about the back to the future they've never been good those video games a back to the future video  game never good we'll see this one's supposed to be okay but they have like marty carrying like  grape soda over a white rug you know like will he make it won't he make it you know  you know you know well that sounds like an exciting uh exciting day at the movie team oh it was i i was 
[00:13:30]  i decided to see an updated movie oh you saw a new movie i saw jackass 3d holy shit is that fucking  movie good one yeah i i wrote ridiculously hilarious i didn't know how to how to express how great that  movie was and how just ridiculous it was yeah and johnny knoxville has to be out of his out of his  mind the amount of hits he takes in this movie bad unbelievably bad weren't they grooming him to like 
[00:14:00]  be a a kind of a hollywood leading man kind of a thing for 10 minutes he was hoping to move on from  jackass yeah they kind of threw him in a few movies and he was in the retard movie but they sort of made  a pc so it kind of duke's a hazard is that the one that the uh special olympics actually endorsed  endorsed and cooperated with the ringer yeah because they didn't take it to the limit it was the ringer  which could have if uh yeah looking at it as a comedy you could really do a lot of things with it but  they decided to do it with with the help of the special olympics so it kind of just the movie kind of 
[00:14:30]  just sat there could have been way better way better every line should have been duh shut up  but that jackass 3d and the reaction in the audience oh my god the whole fucking theater  into it yeah big time yeah how's the 3d did they use it was good but you could take the glasses off  and watch it as a regular movie matter i like that yeah because some of these 3d movies you take the  glasses off take a little break and you're like whoa what the fuck there's no difference when 
[00:15:00]  you're watching the 3d movie without the glasses i didn't i took it off only for in all fairness  less than a minute nothing gets a little blurry it didn't seem like it yeah i don't know how that  works but it didn't seem like it the the 30 seconds or whatever i took it off for because i was i was  wondering what it looked like without the glasses you know because i know when i watch um uh honey i  shrunk the audience at uh epcot and took off the glasses off it's like a double image and or parts of 
[00:15:30]  it are double image maybe you know the whole thing looks off oh no i didn't i didn't feel that  at all shit and it's not the red and blue glasses it's like the polarized yeah glasses so that fucking  movie though man jesus unbelievable i don't want to give away any of the stunts because there's still  a shitload of people that are gonna go see jackass 3d but i laughed so fucking hard man good one so  fucking hard that's a good one how was the b one to be uh um the b one uh i i want to go a couple 
[00:16:00]  more weeks and then we can discuss jackass 3d okay i i was suspicious i i'll tell you why they never  showed the beast things at the end of it huh so now we had a discussion about that after the movie  they did they not show the beast things because then that would fuck up their r rating would it be  too gratuitous gratuitous gratuitous i can't fucking talk today fuck like i don't know what that's  about because if they're playing tetherball with a beehive basically i mean they put the bees inside 
[00:16:30]  i always show the after they didn't show the after and i'm wondering if that had something to do with  the ratings board do you think they felt it would they might have showed it in another jackass or maybe  they thought it wasn't a big enough deal or maybe they just didn't get stung enough i don't know  so they wanted to kind of leave it to your imagination so that was suspicious and then they  they had a little a little too much funnel nudity oh oh really a little too much a lot of a lot of  cock but they had and this stuff is so weird to me because jimmy has uh dealt with it uh with 
[00:17:00]  comedy central and all that they were they were able to show the cock but then they had a black out  the cock so i guess they could only show the cock a certain amount of time and then the ratings board  would have it all right would be okay with that so then they would then they would uh kind of block  it out i don't want to give away the stunt but there was a stunt with a penis obviously so they  sort of had it blocked out but then when you really needed to see the penis it was there for you and then  they block it out again it was the weirdest thing odd maybe it maybe it's also the uh was anything 
[00:17:30]  happening to the penis when they blocked it out not in a sexual way whatsoever no yeah but maybe  they can just show it but then the second you're fiddling with it in any way shape or form no no no  without giving away the stunt no it was more like they could only show it a certain amount of time and  then the ratings board would be okay with that yeah you're only allowed really bizarre because it was  a big black like uh rect rect rectangle covering up the penis and then they let that go away for a 
[00:18:00]  little bit to show the stunt and then it was quickly back on it really strange it's odd it is  odd right what is that about i don't know the ratings board is stupid the stupid lawyers and the ratings  board yeah it's just awful but johnny knoxville is just out of his mind there's there's a couple  hits he takes you just don't know how i'll tell you the the other one that he gets blindsided by uh  an nfl uh you know player oh he goes up the middle for a pass and the it's an nfl quarterback 
[00:18:30]  you know uh throwing the pass so he's looking at the ball and this guy just destroys him comes out  of nowhere you know it's it's set up as a stunt and i don't know how anyone takes a hit like that  that what did he doesn't play football oh he just got fucking destroyed it's great sean william scott  was a um like a celebrity ref for that bit and he's looking like you gotta be kidding me why am i a part  of this so the movie was unbelievable though really really good yeah they know how to fuck 
[00:19:00]  each other up that slow motion camera that uh who was talking about bam yeah yeah and uh steve-o  we're talking about wow really brings some of the stunts together yeah you just see sky's face sliding  off his skull yeah all i want to do is talk about the movie i'm trying not to because uh like i said  i'm sure people will be seeing it this week and next week but after next week then all bets are off  then we'll discuss the movie like yeah i gotta see it's not like the plot of sixth sense where  you gotta worry about you know you know you don't you know you want to be surprised by some of the  stunts yeah and uh yeah kenny said knoxville is just looking beat up he looks he looks a little 
[00:19:30]  up a little rough around the edges to be fair yeah yeah you know i don't blame him i'm sure he's got  some i was thinking maybe he's got some painkillers or something uh painkillers oh really  has to make up for it yeah because they're not they're not kids anymore i'm sure he's got some  injuries that he's still dealing with you know yeah so jesus steve-o wasn't in the movie that much  no but when he was he was fantastic i think he said he's in the the video 3.5 yeah the 3.5 
[00:20:00]  the dvd out yeah but his stunts were over the top so yeah yeah oh yeah yeah yeah yeah well they  launch him in that uh portable toilet that looks hysterical unbelievable he's screaming  unbelievable let me say hi to jake in jersey jake what's up guys hey man hey you guys catch  brock lesnar getting his ass fucking kicked oh my god certainly did hold on hold hold on hold on  one second somebody's saying uh steve-o in toronto fake name why don't you use your real fucking name 
[00:20:30]  opi was a joke you didn't get it the the black bar over the cocks a joke yeah then i didn't get the  joke then they failed miserably making me laugh uh with that it just looked weird and uh like  something was out of place what was the joke asshole uh go ahead jake uh block lesnar in his ass kicked  yeah yeah that mexican nailed him yeah okay oh boy i thought i thought brock looked a little um 
[00:21:00]  looked a little heavier out of shape a little bit but he still looked like brock but he put on a  couple pounds yeah but it looked like the pounds he put on were not muscle yeah like he had uh his  back and it's his gut look look big he was he was flabbier you know and i know that's a lot of he's  got a lot of weight and a lot of power behind him but man he just got out fucking fought velasquez is  not it's not surprising i mean like because he he can uh he's got good hands man he can box but i i was 
[00:21:30]  surprised that he lost because he had him like 20 pounds and i didn't realize that kane hit as hard as he  did like i knew he hit hard but i didn't realize that that's this we're watching right now where  he hits lesnar at one point where he falls all the way across the ring can you rewind that danny i  think he hits him yeah you see how his left elbow caught his fucking head his chin it was almost  accidental oh man that was an amazing and they just kept pummeling him to see a guy that big get beat  up is fucking amazing he doesn't look like he's out of shape bro no no i mean lesnar doesn't look like 
[00:22:00]  he was out of shape if you saw him standing there before the fight he wasn't that he wasn't slightly  soft or anything yeah he didn't take the fight seriously a little soft yeah kane after carwin  after that carwin beating it's kind of hard to get juiced up for anybody you know because it came  is i don't think he hits as hard as shane carwin so that was pretty amazing he had on his eye he had  a uh monster gas oh man yeah that cut he had he got fucked up pretty good i think that was from the  elbow we just saw yeah there was it was like an accidental left elbow yeah but that yeah that put 
[00:22:30]  like a fucking huge uh his face was covered in blood he was kind of humble in defeat though i mean  he was you know i humble you with the common clutch i fuck you in the ass but i like brock more now  than i used to yeah yeah man i i kind of felt bad that he got beat up so bad yeah well his game plan  when he came out right from the bell was to like to bum rush him and he just looked sloppy he came  out and ran right after him and he he just you know it didn't he was just like swinging widely and 
[00:23:00]  he threw that flying knee like he did i don't know he he just looked sloppy like he was just coming out  and that was the game plan to come out and bum rush him but his thing is to get people on the ground  and he's so strong and so heavy like you know frank mir is a uh a brazilian uh jiu-jitsu black belt  and submission especially and he made him look horrendous on the floor yeah so if he gets you on the  ground you're in deep shit but uh he got him on the ground and and velasquez popped right back 
[00:23:30]  dude right back up he couldn't keep him down yeah that's a strong little bastard man yeah better  skills velasquez definitely yeah finally brock got caught right tell you i'm calling him a little  bastard he weighs 244 yeah a little bad little guy the little guy one tiny little guy i gotta i gotta  i gotta clear something up so people are dummies yeah when we're talking about back to the future  hey uh it's like no they went 30 years he went 30 years in the future yeah that was later in the 
[00:24:00]  movie at the very beginning he said he was going to go 25 years in the future that was before the  libyans got there so don't tell me my friend he said he was going to go 25 years in the future  and then they wound he wound up going 30 years in the future uh at the end of the movie yeah and uh  marty wound up going 30 years back there you go past but at the beginning he was going to go 25  uh he never got to do that because the libyans came and shot him let's go to drew drew 
[00:24:30]  motherfuckers drew your turn brother let's go no uh i was gonna say brock lesnar getting his ass  kick was a long time coming man fucking uh shane carwin i don't know how he didn't finish the fight  but he dude he definitely should have lost that fight shane said that his body i i think that  shane had him in real bad shape but shane said his body went numb like the adrenaline or whatever was so  over whatever it was that happened to him when he like in between rounds he just his body went numb 
[00:25:00]  like he probably i think you're right he should have won but he just couldn't finish him but that  made me like lesnar like he took a fucking every one of shane's punches it's like a baseball bat and  he took it and he kept kicking him off and you know i gave a lot of credit for surviving that round  that was amazing well also uh you gotta understand that you know them  fucking them dudes have been doing it since they were you know five years old brock lesnar's  new to it right that's how the guy could defend himself so well when brock took him to the ground 
[00:25:30]  and laid on top of him you know that's what he did the fight i watched on uh spike tv before it came uh  before the uf the pay-per-view or whatever is it amazing whenever you see guys who you think like no  one's ever going to beat this guy up these other guys who are in this world like they know he's a good  fighter and he's a tough guy but there's always a guy who's just not afraid of you and who can  it's amazing how it's um it's a weird world to be that mentality to live in that mentality is 
[00:26:00]  unbelievable to look at brock lesnar across the ring and know that his job right now is to beat  the shit out of you because you're trying to take what's his and to be calm and cool about that you  think his time in the ufc is almost over brock lesnar i mean obviously he'll fight again but i mean as  far as being the main guy like he's been the last couple of years i don't know he's 33 he's  all he's got probably a few years but i'm just saying i'm just saying like it looks like he was  exposed on saturday as far as not being as talented as the rest of these guys he's got to come back and 
[00:26:30]  own somebody of you know right with a name yeah that's that's all he's got to do there's a carlin  rematch to definitely have that i'm not saying it's a has-been or anything right that but it's obvious  that's these these guys out there that have way more skills than he does like the last squares i think that  was uh i kind of think it was good for the ufc in a way like as far as a financial empire because  dana was showing it in mexico and now you just got the entire country interested in this guy oh yeah  now they go to mexico now dana takes over mexico the rematch should be velasquez and uh and brock 
[00:27:00]  in mexico oh that would be a massive massive event i would if i was lesnar i would just drink a bunch  of their water before the match and then sit on his face right out of the ring  well uh all i wanted to say was uh i think shane carwin is definitely the best heavyweight in the ufc  and he should have won that fight and if he gets a shot at the title he will win it but brock lesnar 
[00:27:30]  is the one that puts that in the seat i'm gonna punch out boy hold on me yes i like i like carwin a  lot too but do you think he's the best because he's not the best wrestler i don't think like i  think brock was a better wrestler than he was um i think shane's a great puncher and a very very you  know he again he hits like a cannonball but was he the best wrestler well as far as the wrestling  aspect no but carwin i like watching him because his hands man yeah but you know he's got sick hands 
[00:28:00]  and uh you know uh he put brock on his ass you know he punched brock i mean it's hard to put a 285  pound fucking beast like that on his ass right hit him with one punch you know and you know brock  came out in the second round and you know used his assets to win the fight but shane carwin is the  best heavyweight in the ufc i'm gonna say that okay all right brock's thing too is he can't like shane can  knock you can probably murder you with a punch sure brock's punches i mean in our world are probably 
[00:28:30]  deadly but in that heavyweight world he doesn't knock people out with his punches he's got to be  on top of you would you take a punch from brock lesnar just to the shoulder not not even in the  fucking calf oh god can you imagine thank you sir let's go to silvio in ohio silvio what's up bro  what's up brother i think uh i think sam might know a little bit if he's around uh but you're talking  about brock being a has-been too i think this sport more than anything i i don't want to say  he's a has-been i'm just saying i'm wondering if you know us all thinking about brock as the guy in 
[00:29:00]  the ufc if that's uh you know going to come to an end in the next uh year or so well not even a year  so is it is it on its way out now i think i think the matchups in this matter so much that you could be  the top of your game and just something your your worst part of your weakest link could be someone  else's trouble point and then you wind up not looking as good right uh very profound  i uh i i i don't understand why tito's still fighting what what is he doing and even dana 
[00:29:30]  white hinted like what is he doing yeah tito knew he got beat up he doesn't need hasn't he lost like  five out of the last six fights something like that or four out of the last five he's he's pretty  much lost a lot of fights in a row now he just does not have it liddell did that too at the end  it's just like those guys no matter how talented they are it's like it's just it's hard to keep  that level up for you know they have to be they have to be shown the fucking door or to walk away  by an ass beating they really do did tito look really bad i didn't get to see yeah yeah he looked 
[00:30:00]  terrible he he put the other guy's arm up he knew there was no doubt oh really yeah yeah uh silvio go  ahead uh brock's walking by uh i guess his exit from after losing and undertaker's getting ringside  interviewed about the sport about the fight about things and he just stops talking to the  interviewer and stares at brock and brock looks at the undertaker and all 40 year old undertaker just  goes you want to go what i don't know what that's about yeah and then brock looked away first of all 
[00:30:30]  undertaker's got to be well over 40. he's been wrestling since i was a kid i think he's been around  forever and uh we don't know what that was about we're all trying to figure it out we all saw the  the videotape right sam has said something on twitter saying it was something about helen fell  but i he's an idiot well yeah i would like to ask sam but doesn't he he's i mean brock's the ufc  guy and i don't think dana white's gonna play that horse shit like no promotion crap so what so  brock lesnar would have to leave the ufc for him to join some kind of uh wwe event so i don't know 
[00:31:00]  what the fuck with that was about and you never know with wrestling and it doesn't matter anyway the  point is moot because uh the undertaker was buried alive last night he's dead that's what uh the  undertaker's officially dead he was buried alive last night i mean he's buried alive how how could  he wrestle uh or fight or anything when he's been buried alive sam that's what i'm saying i don't  understand i was just telling travis i don't know what you guys are doing talking about ufc when the  big sports story coming out of this weekend is that the undertaker was buried alive by his brother 
[00:31:30]  buried alive by his brother right so it's it's over why would that take was dead right it doesn't  really matter yeah yeah what the whole brock undertaker thing was but he is dead he's the  dead man well yeah so he's been buried alive before don't get me wrong don't get me wrong  well he is the dead man he knows how to get out of those situations before you uh continue with this  discussion here's uh what went on after the brock lesnar fight oh they're interviewing the  undertaker who's a big mma fan big ufc fan and this is how i went down i'm actually 
[00:32:00]  very surprised it's almost like you're at a loss for words here you want to do it  there's brock lesnar right there what did you just say to him  it's kind of a personal thing uh you know i think maybe he needs to uh yeah i think he needs to train  a little harder um are you guys cool personal 
[00:32:30]  who are you rooting for tonight  you know what i uh i got background with brock but uh you know that just showed you something right  there i i don't know what to think of that that is weird and if it's personal why'd you bring it up  in front exactly in front of this guy and obviously it's going to go viral so it's got to be a work so  what are they not from brock's brock's not going to work that why doesn't he sound like the undertaker  what do you mean he didn't really sound like the undertaker when the just a regular guy he's not 
[00:33:00]  like some guy just being interviewed well i think he tries to he's got to put on a public persona why  didn't his eyes go white that's what i'm saying here he's putting on the public persona oh is that  it he can't be himself the dead man but i mean the dead man he's not gonna the undertaker's not  gonna fight an mma fight at this point no he's 45 of course not so are they gonna have a street brawl  or is this a work for the wwe well the undertaker is that no one knows about except the undertaker 
[00:33:30]  obviously the undertaker goes to every mma show he goes to every ufc show so it's not like  he has a problem with brock lesnar dating back to the old days because why would it take years for  like he's always in the front row there well you know a lot about wrestling do these two ever have  a problem no outside the ring that you know of no the wrestlers i mean brock lesnar when he left wwe  people had a problem with him but that was seven years ago yeah what the hell at this point they like  him now because brock being good in ufc makes them look more legitimate right so all the wrestlers like 
[00:34:00]  brock so what the fuck is this about whatever you think it was publicity some kind of a you think  it's a real thing or some kind of a thing that's not aggressive but like the two friends would say  to each other um well undertaker said you want to do it do you want to do it like he wouldn't he  wouldn't if he were if you were actually challenging brock lesnar to a fight he wouldn't do it at the ufc  right after brock like he wouldn't no brock would murder him anyway yeah i it just the context doesn't 
[00:34:30]  make any sense 45 years old he's going to go out there and bust it get busted up if there was you  know all brock lesnar really did was stare back at him yeah so i mean the brock didn't really have to  work if it was a work brock lesnar wasn't doing much well to work it yeah i mean brock just lost a  fight so it's a it's a it's weird that it's the whole thing is weird you want to do it 
[00:35:00]  well i mean he's got the height on him but that's about it i wouldn't be hugely surprised if they're  trying to get brock lesnar to wrestle one more match maybe well really like a wrestlemania or  oh do you want to do it you like you all you want to wrestle right right like you want to do the  this match like i'm sure the offer's been put out there and i mean but then maybe you just asked him  like that and he should have just punched his face especially after losing a fucking  especially after losing a championship belt like that if he's doing if he's trying to get him to 
[00:35:30]  wrestle what a horse's ass if that's what that is what an ass you want to do it meaning get in a ring  and and do fake moves on each other but he knew that both of them i mean brock lesnar wrestled for  a few years so he knows something about performance and i mean yeah when he first when he beat what's  his name frank mirror he cut a promo on him so there is some professional wrestling in  brock lesnar's blood but after you lose a championship yeah match for real maybe you're  feeling a little bad yeah a little poorly the undertaker doesn't really know anything about 
[00:36:00]  that that's true so yeah yeah look i i would assume the undertaker's the type of guy that's not scared  of anyone though yeah i mean the other might not be the smartest thing not to be tough guy anyone but  still you want to do it what does that mean what does it wrestle match yeah yeah that's a dumb place  to try to get that going though i mean not really there's a camera on you and everybody's talking  about it that's true he didn't say what it was it's publicity yeah now everybody's trying to figure  out what it was if he said you want to wrestle at wrestlemania everybody would be like that's the 
[00:36:30]  dumbest thing i've ever heard of course of course but the fact that he said you want to do it and people  think oh shit what's going on is he going to mma is it oh yeah why does he just sit down and watch  the fucking show shut up but it looks like brock is caught off guard because brock wouldn't  brock wouldn't agree to get into some weird wrestling storyline right after he loses a fight  right after he won a fight he could beat him up right right there after his pummeling he just took  if they went into the ring he could beat up the undertaker i hope all this is is before the fight 
[00:37:00]  like the undertaker asked him if he wanted to go get some diner food yeah yeah and brock's like  no i'm not hungry yeah i'm in town i haven't seen you in a while or if they have homosexual encounters  and that really does mean like do you want to fuck each other in the ass do it hotel room and brock's  like look man it's my room okay leave me alone i think and i also think if if this was something real  brock lesnar seems like the type of guy he would have just tried to punch him in the face right there  or something because he just lost a fight he's not in a good mood to begin with no he just 
[00:37:30]  eyeballed him and walked away right but they both know that there's a camera on them the guy does  lots of mma stuff so they both know this is going to get hit like crazy and i mean even if he just  lost a fight they both know that there's an opportunity to make some a lot of money if they  can get a buzz on this i don't know i'm really confused by this one i'm gonna think i'm gonna guess  the mentality of a heavyweight champion who has just lost in the first round is not going to be one of  thinking of anything but getting the fuck out of that of course yeah yeah this was the last thing 
[00:38:00]  on his mind so it doesn't seem like brock was in on this maybe i don't think either of them were in  on it but uh maybe there was a plan but if if brock won maybe there was a plan if he won that they would  have traded a little few barbs back and forth but the fact that he lost he just eyeballed him and  walked the fuck away what's he gonna start trash talking after he just took a horrid beating i  think they're there i mean there's too many factors if that had been a wwe interview yeah then it would 
[00:38:30]  have been set up but i don't think it was set up i think it was just convenient that there was a  camera there and they said all right maybe they were using you know ufc like hey you know i think  we get in here they'll throw mike on me i'll say some shit yeah the undertaker did you do that  get in there and do it well we'll know more as the week goes on why don't you just say hey man  you get him next time or whatever that's what you say to a guy after he loses you don't give him  some fucking idiotic get him next time or whatever you say whatever you say i mean you betcha 
[00:39:00]  you got moxie yeah all right maybe that's not the best but i don't what would you say to a guy  after he's been beaten like that nothing hey man i'm sorry that's why i'm confused because yeah i mean  brock's at a low place right now so if it was all fake why i don't know man you know what i mean  why why take that moment brock had nothing to do with that i'm telling you no well he looked at him  like are you an asshole right doing as he should have uh is it true yes tito ortiz has not won a  fight since october 10th 2006 that's about right he's he's lost like the last five out of six or 
[00:39:30]  something that's four out of years yeah he hasn't won a fight in four years well there was some down  time he hasn't been fighting a lot yeah he hasn't fought a lot since then well jesus he stinks uh  before our first break we take from wrestling to vince mcmahon well he is wrestling i guess  oh his uh his wifey there is trying to become a politician yeah and she's gonna run connecticut  and a ruling came down that you can't wear wwe shirts to the to the polls because it's it's it's 
[00:40:00]  considered what advertising dumb to vote if you do oh that's considered advertising but uh michelle  obama could go to the polls and and talk about her husband and what a great job he's doing to the  people that are going in to vote all right with impunity fuck this shit fuck her well  fuck the wwe fuck everyone stop it already vince has a campaign going that he says the media is 
[00:40:30]  prejudice against them and he's trying to get the fans to stand up well for wwe sam i'm not a big  fan of the media but they might have a point here why you can't wear a john cena shirt i'm just saying  the wwe and wwf it's it's been a rough place that is a totally separate entity from her uh running for  uh office and travis to me we were discussing this and he brought up a great point if eric want if eric  if he wants to go vote he should be allowed to wear his million dollar championship belt that he wears 
[00:41:00]  everywhere else anyway so you just see him just coming in with the dumb belt on voting so what what  i'm gonna vote so what's the ruling you can't wear your wwe stuff why though the ruling is that uh  pollsters are allowed to make the call there they're allowed to send people home they're allowed  to oh that's good if they're wearing wwe shirts because it's they say it's campaigning for linda  mcmahon you're not supposed to campaign right right an extra amount of feed to the polling right  exactly well vince mcmahon had this to say he's not happy last monday we began a global initiative to 
[00:41:30]  stand up for wwe i believe wwe fans our organization as well as our superstars have been and continue to  be discriminated against by elitist government officials and some members of the media i asked  you to do something about it i asked you to stand up for wwe and you did but check this out you want  to talk about discriminating government officials the connecticut secretary of state issued an order 
[00:42:00]  that if you show up at the polls wearing any wwe merchandise whether it's a john cena t-shirt or  randy orton wristband you may not be allowed to vote wristband yeah the connecticut secretary of state  gave the authority to local poll workers great to determine that if anyone shows up wearing wwe  merchandise you you may be forced to go home and change you may be forced to cover it up you may be  forced to take it off in order to vote take it off now whether you're a democrat republican or independent 
[00:42:30]  denying you your right to vote denying you your first amendment rights is un-american  unconstitutional unconstitutional and blatantly discriminatory against you our wwe universe  i encourage you to stand up for yourself and stand up for wwe thank you so he wants everyone  to go to the polling places with fucking shirts on i don't think so yeah that wouldn't be a good idea 
[00:43:00]  he wasn't quite saying that because then his wife would lose votes how about he just shuts the  fuck up and and how that doesn't ruin it for his wife shuts the fuck it's been about him for decades  how about you let your wife have a little spotlight here that is ridiculous though because  it's not campaigning it's not fucking campaigning for her um if anything it works against her it's  campaigning for yeah yeah for democrats it shows that you're broke yeah when when michelle obama  went into an early they were doing early polling for certain people they get to vote early and uh 
[00:43:30]  uh she's uh holding court about uh what her husband does and his accomplishments and then  they actually uh a white house spokesperson said said oh you know a wife can't talk about her husband  it's like no not when the wife is the first lady and the husband's the fucking president and and and  she's fucking talking him up to to voters that is a blatant fucking violation right there and they  swept that one right under the carpet never heard another word about it but i can't wear my randy 
[00:44:00]  orton wristbands to vote i have to now take my randy orton wristbands off well i'm not in connecticut  but no just to be safe though i'm not going to wear it yeah you never know yeah are you supposed to  wipe this sweat off your brow with exactly what i vote for oh  exactly exactly uh let's say hi to steve on long island steve why can't they wear wwe shirts i see 
[00:44:30]  something a little more sinister do you really holy shit steve what's up what's going on guys i have  a little theory about brock and undertaker okay that's why we put you on the air let's go  i know i'm tired let's imagine for a moment that there was something personal going beyond behind  the scenes with the both of them let's you got to think that as one of the angles sure  and after he got his ass kicked undertaker was like hey fuck it he utilized the moment 
[00:45:00]  to embarrass him a little bit by calling that into a fight yeah never gonna happen and say oh what  pussy you want to go and then he just knowing he's beaten and defeated he's not gonna do nothing  and he'll walk away and then guy goes oh what was that about and he's like no don't worry about it  it's personal yeah yeah i think he might have used the situation but there is no behind the scenes they  work in two different scenes i know yeah they don't hang out you never know maybe in the old days  there's something still but then he said that brock lesnar didn't should needs to train uh better or 
[00:45:30]  whatever train a little harder a little harder i don't know if brock wanted to hear that or have  someone say that well i mean half wrestlers so that's got to piss you off a little bit experienced  wrestlers are good at and uh yeah but but brock really takes the mma thing very seriously so  oh that's uh good are you going to be able to wear uh ultimate warrior face paint to vote  do you think well that's not technically merchandise so i would think that should be  okay you should be able to wear ultimate warrior face paint yeah or dress up like gold  dust the warrior face he's voting all right thanks for the theory man 
[00:46:00]  and to the the first caller who said that i mentioned on twitter that undertaker was upset  about losing to brock lesnar in hell in a cell is he kidding just a little joke shut up  say that no i said it but it was a joke like what if you fall into the polling place as uh shock  master you have a bedazzled storm trooper helmet on yeah just crashed through the wall you crashed 
[00:46:30]  through the wall can you then vote or will you be turned away well technically shock master is wcw  so i think that's wcw that's okay okay all right all right i'm just there's a few instances that i  just want to get clear right for the people of connecticut you know that they can vote you know  what wcw or other wrestling stuff might be allowed it's not wwe yeah then what are they gonna do  yeah they can't take it off because they don't know the difference yeah and they just see  wrestling and you'll try to explain and you have lawsuits though and then they'll be oh yeah you 
[00:47:00]  have lawsuits it'll be in court definitely it's a joke who gives a fuck it's a fucking joke  shut the fuck up though let his wife try to win this thing well that race is getting a lot closer too  huh yeah she had her behind she's behind behind by a little bit showing the penis weather that thing is  hilarious what is the afternoon actually showing that on uh that's pretty good it's going around  the internet over the weekend a weather guy and he's uh showing where the storm is and it's in the 
[00:47:30]  perfect shape of the penis and then the border of what mexico and texas makes it look like the  fucking cock head the cock what if you vote right and you're in the booth the the curtains closed and you  go whoo after the vote they'll go shit they can they'll be like ah damn it he got through or if  you bust through the curtains like it's an entrance way in place yeah music music on your phone you got  a little triple h music you play it you come through the curtain or you you're in there you vote yeah 
[00:48:00]  and then you quickly put a hulkamania bandana on you come out and say look at me and you rip your shirt  off like you you vote and then you pull the curtain away and then pyro goes off and you walk it yeah  yeah a little pyrotechnic that's allowed to be great it's after you vote and it's really  sticking it to them that's a way to screw them that's what the wwe universe should do that's how  you stand up for wwe yeah i'm standing up for wwe yeah well maybe after you vote wrestling with  everybody oh jip that would be crazy yeah 
[00:48:30]  all right we should take a break thank you sam are we gonna finally do john and jeff i hope so  boy we sure didn't get to him why don't we try to do john and jeff after the break let's do that  and uh and we'll talk a little football football yeah i don't think it was very alive giants and  giants were both off who cares jimmy's fucking team's in deep shit they're finished i think  they're terribly coached already i think they're terribly coached all those penalties they that  wade i think they're terrible they lose tonight forget it they're done anyway wade phillips 
[00:49:00]  terrible yeah i guess you're right but officially they would be done if they lose one in four  fuck them i don't like roma though i never liked roma i think he's a choke artist i don't think  he'll ever win a fucking big game or have a great he'll he'll win the fucking in the middle  of the season he'll win like you know 37 and 10 of great games and then lose every other game  where it matters what can't hold a fucking uh a field goal he can't fucking uh get the big pass  when he needs i can't stand him and we should talk world series too after the break yeah we're 
[00:49:30]  the only ones who will no one cares about texas i'm no kidding that's what we're saying before  the show except for the people living in giants i'd like to giants yankees would have been a cool one  to watch well you needed a rod to produce for that to happen cocksucker he should be forced to give  his fucking money back with some of it yeah he stinks he does the only time he was good in the  postseason was last year right last year but when you pay a guy that much money you you need him to  be good in every single fucking postseason yep pick the team up when they're not doing well he blows 
[00:50:00]  what did he did he what they they did nothing they did absolutely nothing right only a couple  ribbies the ones during a rally i think he started the rally yeah but he was horrendous yeah all right  we'll talk more about that and other things the virus sirius xm this is the ob and anthony show

[00:52:30]  oh my gosh that's all i got thanks man i appreciate it thank you i will i definitely  want to thank you so much guys harvey levin good for rich and bonnie but just when they pant he  first of all he he looks like an aids patient now i love how skinny he is i hope whatever it is it's  fucking eating at him not a big fan of harvey levin i just i i don't i have no respect for him i think  he's he's he's predatorial yeah we kind of called him out on that and he i think he's despicable he  tried to say he wasn't one of those guys that he's trying to do something a little different 
[00:53:00]  with his show he's despicable than the rest of the paparazzi people dumb cup oh i hate that he's  sitting behind a wall just laughing like it's a good-natured company meeting yeah and uh yeah but  then they talk about stuff that is happening on tmz and then he walks and writes it on the board like  we have to talk about that but they just talked they just talked about it doesn't make any sense how  they set up the whole show oh he's like oh that's a good one we've got to make sure we talk about  that you just did you just did so there's no reason to write it on your stupid board with your 
[00:53:30]  sippy cup yeah why are they having that meeting when it's that's the show it's it's just more  fucking faggot tattletale mentality like i don't mind that they're sitting around cubicles like  shooting the shit and then trashing people but then to turn around and put it on a board like oh  oh that's good yeah that's good for the show that don't make sense we're on the show right  not a fan of harvey i i hate all those paparazzi because again i understand there's a there's a  hunger for it but i really like believe that princess diana was was uh killed because they 
[00:54:00]  were trying to get away from paparazzi and again maybe her driver will you believe that one  probably shouldn't have a few cocktails you're right absolutely but i think you should just be  able to shoot at them that's my opinion i would love i would love that'd be nice for a celebrity  bodyguard to be able to do that yeah they're shooting at you you might as well be able to  shoot back right i just have such a loathing for them and then you punch one of those guys in the  face and then you're in trouble and they cry and sue like little yeah you have to settle you even 
[00:54:30]  though they're money even though they're in your way that's why i love your life he really is an  animal with those guys he fucking hates them yeah no he's got enough money he'll just give him some  money yeah he throws their camera down spits throws three bucks on the ground yeah god damn tmz don't  respect nothing just trying to go to a wedding sonny handled it you that's how you gotta handle  it like sonny but he did exactly what the don wouldn't have wanted yes he breaks the camera 
[00:55:00]  throws hundreds uh santino i thought i'm a bad don rest in peace  sonny's a hothead i've been obsessed with marlon brando for a while like i'm watching interviews and  clips he's just the greatest cocksucker ever and i was watching clips of him do uh shakespeare  really fucking brando was amazing man really it's like shakespeare does nothing for me but i watched  him delivering shakespeare with emotion like wow did he get it he was just he was doing some 
[00:55:30]  mark anthony's speech i guess brutus had died or whatever it was uh brutus  but i'm just like he i i couldn't stop watching it i'm like he was he really was not an overrated  actor just great and then i was watching humphrey bogart in uh whatever he was in  and you're just like god what a difference between those old school guys african queen 
[00:56:00]  no it was uh casablanca yeah see i miss you kid oh that's just how they acted back then it stinks  they didn't know any better i know i stink they didn't know they stunk yeah see kid shut up  they just had to be over the top back then for whatever reason yeah there was a that was  there was a transition transitional period where it was like uh the old actors they could do anything  they could just stand there ah yes my dear why don't we go to dinner it's just horrible acting and  then some people like started understanding what it was like to to make it more realistic but they 
[00:56:30]  had a thing i was reading no desire to make it realistic no just to go with your point and then  what was the movie that all of a sudden they that turned the whole movie industry where where they're  saying no let's start getting realistic roles and movies i think brando was a big part of turning  things around as far as people's acting goes uh because i can't even think on the waterfront who was  really good maybe yeah like what actors were good i mean you could watch an entertaining movie with 
[00:57:00]  like carrie grant but is carrie grant really realistic no he's not it was a movement it's  like alternative comedy at one point like it was like a movement that kind of i think just started  and i was reading somewhere bogart said like he kind of resented the younger guys like brando  because they were shitting on the older guys and he was like you know i came out to hollywood  one with one suit and i was a bum he shows up with one sweatshirt and they fall all over it was  something like that wow but you know he was it's like when you watch it now in hindsight 
[00:57:30]  it's like you know 50 years removed the fucking brando and those guys were just so much better  the time was right for a change out there paul newman was good yes i think paul newman was good  back then yeah but they were already doing realistic stuff yeah yeah like who was the guy that kind  of started that movement brando james you gotta think maybe maybe it was brando maybe he was  the guy that changed that whole thing around yeah there's a couple other guys that were mentioned  too as part of that who um oh that's fucking street crime desire 
[00:58:00]  stupid stella you think stella's still hot no  all ralph this looks like the honeymoon is  look at that whore oh yeah she was a little jezebel kind of looks like a man though from that angle  oh she's awful right i was sweaty back then oh yeah there was no a city it's sweaty i was just 
[00:58:30]  sweaty just coming down the stairs to fuck rando yeah suck his suck his cock a young muscular stanley  kowalski he'd rather have a another man back then he just got bored of  pussy stuck his dick and everything and give me the mighty mouse guy's cock i'll suck that for a few  minutes i think it was underdog it was underdog or whatever some cartoon cock  oh he was just great this is not a good scene to play on the radio what happened though he just 
[00:59:00]  really enjoyed food you could see his hair though you could see his hair like even in the one i was  watching where he's doing the mark anthony speech i think it was mark anthony believe me baby  his hair you could see he was losing his hair early yeah that's got all fat i don't know when he  loved food i'm gonna guess it was after uh last tango in paris in like 72 he put some weight on and  yeah it was all the calories from the butter up his ass that started it cholesterol directly into your 
[00:59:30]  rectum he was so crazy acting's a worthless profession he just would just he didn't give a  fuck no was orson wells one of those names jimmy um because that might he might he might have been  in the movement to get uh more real shit out there i think as a director he probably changed it  more because he the way he directed over the top as an actor he was a little weird but i think the  directing was the amazing part no wine before it's time i don't know if he's a method actor though 
[01:00:00]  what do you think like i don't know i think he was before that i could be wrong though someone who  really knows film history better than i do might know that's a good question but i've been on youtube  watching this stuff and it's like fuck man i i never liked shakespeare i think it stinks yeah  it's unwatchable yeah oh who the half shut up what i don't understand what you mean i don't get it  there's a commercial on now for that goddamn yeah what is that one with um uh learner associates with 
[01:00:30]  take a dip from poppy that guy who's that he's just some some guy david learner i'll teach you all you  need to know about poppy bonds and buying stock in the stuff he just sounds like an over-the-top jewish  guy oh and then now now there's one where he goes i recently saw shakespeare and then he starts quoting  it with this echo in the background tries to be all dramatic can we out out candle out and it's like 
[01:01:00]  it's done with this horrid over the top you sound too jewish to be doing this dialect it's so bad  i'm david learner i recently saw shakespeare oh yeah you got it yeah i know david learner but i i  haven't heard that one yeah i think it's just like a low it's i mean it's got to be a local radio spot  i don't know how national david learner is or anything for uh his uh accent and stuff and everything  but it's so bad because they put they try to put like a stage echo on it like he's actually acting 
[01:01:30]  and it's horrible take a tip from poppy a lot of people saying on the waterfront yeah kind of  changed a lot of things like the beatles changed music and everybody people are coming in with that  one and the rod steiger like how much brando hated him story jay actually jay moore turned me on to  that and then whenever i watched that scene of those guys in the car the i could have been a contender  which is the the most famous scene amazing you can see rod steiger is just delivering dialogue 
[01:02:00]  weird like you know before you get to 1420 front street whatever the street was and brando's just  like collapsing on himself oh you know who was fucking amazing in dramatic roles goddamn gleason  fucking gleason was great what did he do he did gilly or something or when he played the weird  clown or sad retarded guy didn't really talk and yeah it was kind of retarded or something  and then uh in uh was that the the the fucking hustler the hustler was great hustler was great he 
[01:02:30]  was really good in that he actually got the real fucking pool player to change his name he was  minnesota fats i think in the real pool player was like new york fats or something yeah and then he  just changed it and he did most of his own shots in that movie yeah you know how to play pool oh he  was great yeah play a little pool there ralphie boy all right uh moving on to a few other things uh  brett farve brett farrier another bad game for him yesterday did they lose oh yeah good uh viking 
[01:03:00]  the packers beat the vikings 28 24 ah they must have loved that three interceptions for farver whoops  and uh he's admitting to leaving the voicemails but he's not admitting to the cockpit stop  it's his awful headed cock it's his dumb wee wee well he's trying to protect his record  yeah because if they suspend him then his record is done but if they if he can hold off till the end  of the year right talking about it and then he can retire without ever uh fucking up his record  what they see they're gonna look as much as farver noisbee who cares if he sent his dick to some dummy 
[01:03:30]  who fucking cares yeah what does that matter keep her and her big tits away from the players  they should all send their dicks to her guess who's cocking his bitch  and what does what does she want out of this i don't know more exposure she wasn't hurt by the  cockpicks i hope they don't go down that dumb road i don't know yeah she seems like the type that likes  uh the limelight she likes the limelight so she might be taking advantage in that way yeah so i don't 
[01:04:00]  know but is she looking for a payday because she was hurt or something by the cockpicks didn't she  didn't she not come out didn't somebody else say it i don't know i don't know i should know the facts  more i don't know i know we do she loves the dick pictures you think she loves the pictures i think  so another football news there's a million of these stories now we got a blind kid what what have we  had so far wheelchair kid down syndrome kid yeah all work here scoring touchdowns yeah just to make 
[01:04:30]  everyone feel good feel good stories it's a feel good story now we got a blind kid who does high  school football play by play oh no all right i i don't know every play is like this uh apparently  something happened someone is either running or catching the ball whistle it's not happening anymore  hey why would they allow it b how how does he do it how does he do it they don't need a window for  him does somebody does he wear an earphone and somebody tells him the the play or maybe he's 
[01:05:00]  legally blind but he could kind of see a blur there's a blur on the field a big square i think  a blur is being hurled to another blur yes oh my god the score is now merged i'm here  is this the story yeah i got i got the audio over here too brian let me start with you what made  you decide you wanted to be a sports announcer um well over the years as i got older you know 
[01:05:30]  i've always been fascinated with that kind of this is well spoken yeah exactly  league light if you're gonna be a broadcaster for a football game you kind of have to speak well  yeah for us to listen to that game you should call it cowboy games  what's up with all the feel good stories lately oh we gotta feel good are we supposed to be mad at  this one jimmy or no it's called incredible story of inspiration it's not an inspiration 
[01:06:00]  you're just giving a kid a chance to do this sports yeah he doesn't have any skills at it  i've always been fascinated with that kind of thing you know uh doing uh just listening jesus you're not  deaf you're blind he's he's pretty bad oh he's awful well he's been fascinated with that sort of  thing what sort of thing is that and knees that don't have big bruises on them  i'm pumping at coffee tables get it  i've always been fascinated by things like that what glasses that have a purpose 
[01:06:30]  opposed to yours which you hold eminems in just listening to all of different people you know  voicing their opinions and saying what they want to say not an opinion john how does this work you're  actually sitting beside him and because this was the question everyone was asking the other day we  said you guys were coming on the show everyone wanted to how does this work how does he pull this off  well i i kneel beside him uh-oh and basically we have a few hand signals to uh when it's an exciting 
[01:07:00]  player oh really you jerk his cock yeah a running play heels beside him yeah and they have a few hand  signals when it's an exciting play sure you do oh geez yeah you give him a little jiggle that means  face down if you're tugging him out that means interception you're hoping for a lot of interceptions  oh there are a lot more sometimes one on the field didn't even happen but he calls it 
[01:07:30]  uh when it's an exciting player just a regular play and um i do the spotting and  kind of read to him who the offensive player was who the defensive player was the names the numbers  and then let him put it in his own voice and uh his own words so the other guys like a spotter would  do for uh anybody doing a regular football production do they have guys that do that in real life oh yeah  yeah there's there's other guys helping them out helping the announcers out wow 
[01:08:00]  but that's got a problem but i mean the announcers could see most of the  shit themselves this is really weird he needs those glasses and he's a blind guy that needs the  glasses so he doesn't freak everyone yeah yeah because he's freaking everyone out his eyes are all  over the place he looks like a young inus and his facial expressions should we let the kid do this  jimmy it's high school football why not who cares it's an unimportant whatever let him do it i don't  care all right brian so how nervous were you about to call your first game without having seen that 
[01:08:30]  game or any game uh therefore how nervous were you about to call this game with all your friends and  your peers and the students there dude i wasn't nervous at all y'all are you kidding me i wasn't  nervous at all wow wow you were a rock yeah like his eyeballs yeah he did fantastic yeah my dog  bullshit i don't want to have him there he does a great job yeah john what is the feeling in the  booth there being able to sit next to brian and be able to do this it's got to feel incredible 
[01:09:00]  it is it's it's it's it's uh it's a very humbling experience and uh i humble you with  come across i think the the fact is that never give up your dreams uh never never give up follow  your dreams and good things will happen it's uh it's been a tremendous experience for me and i think  for the whole catholic program oh it's catholic program oh boy i don't know if high field but i  don't really care oh well listen to this before we go brian what's your dream job 
[01:09:30]  uh air traffic control is to be a broadcaster for the celtics um you know i've always wanted to be  i mean i usually play like xbox i listen to um and i was just like kevin highland kenny smith  clark catalog yeah um stuff like that you know x is over his eyes box yeah should he look out 
[01:10:00]  really look out watch out for the blind kid that can't speak properly yeah watch out and how does he  play xbox i know poorly you know we do have our own blind intern yeah we do stevie that's true  you should see how well he does trying to commentate a game wow oh good idea that's not a bad idea you  gotta just get one play and get a game or or a clip of a game and yep well that's a great idea man  see how he does it from distance we need a we need a play that everyone knows how about the uh 
[01:10:30]  uh maybe a friend the franco harris the immaculate reception or that's what i'm thinking so everyone  knows the white clark's the catch the catch okay let's oh i like this because we do have our own  blind kit he's not blind blind but he's he's up there well we could tell people whatever the play is  i like hand that's what i'm saying yeah like the catches are going what's a good running play  we'll figure it out i like the catch i like the franco harris thing okay we could start there  no no twy clark the nine is the catch but i mean the franco uh 
[01:11:00]  yeah off the fucking heel didn't they say it actually did hit the ground too or is that  actually discussing that play for fucking 40 years at this point let it go what's the option  what's like the these the the the common belief though i don't think it i don't think it hit the  ground it actually was a catch yeah i think it was a catch you want to start with that danny is he  around uh he's out on a on a run but he should be back eight hours exactly right now here he is  running down the hall that's smart oh god right into oh please right into the window 
[01:11:30]  bird in the side of a building i'd love to see it could you find that play danny so yeah which one  are we doing the the franco harris one yeah yeah yeah yeah everyone knows that you want to pop  tardy brings you back a fucking a manhole cover you dolt famous fucking plays  if you have a suggestion maybe on the the old pal talk or something help us out  oh this is perfect okay where's steve especially because of the  steve get in here you  the reduced video quality oh yeah yeah it's a little harder 
[01:12:00]  grab a mic you  dolt hi stevie it's been a while yeah what's going on what's going on with you man i'm good  how are you well we just did a story uh blind kid calling a football game and uh  danny says you know what we got our own blind kid that's you stevie yes so we want to see how  you would uh call a football play okay you see the screen in front of you sort of yeah sort of  all we want you to do is to explain what's going on in this play okay all right all right

[01:13:00]  ball already okay all right yeah all right you ready all right all right go ahead danny  all right and they've dropped back dives a tackle quarterback throw is up off a helmet  and it's taking my crank o'harris he's down and it's it's in for a touchdown perfect  sweating that bit worked out well you called it perfectly didn't you yeah because you even  know the player hey i guess you know that play yeah i don't really follow football but i know but 
[01:13:30]  he knows that he knows that play i guess we're stupid we picked the one play he knows i figured  we would just throw on some random basis or random basketball games i picked one that anybody could  have done yeah that was exciting do you know the dwayne clark one he did sound retarded the catch  okay what do you mean you don't know football well i know all the good you know because i'm a sports  guy i know a big moment but i mean oh you're a sports guy he's obviously a jock yeah no no i'm not 
[01:14:00]  a jock i just know literally literal stevie really you're a big uh police fan yeah what's your favorite  police song oh god i like so lonely you are lonely you know not no not not because of that  uh oh my god um i see yeah as i know there's a song i i just can't think of the name of it yeah um 
[01:14:30]  the down the down the down the down the up thank you someone look at it yeah i know there's one i i  can't remember the name of it though i can't think of any yeah isn't there one with eyes or c or  something like that i don't know i think there was you're right stevie yeah  how was your weekend stevie it's good how was yours uh great what'd you do i hung out did uh 
[01:15:00]  watch some tv did watch some tv uh-huh he did watch some tv okay uh watch the watch the yankees  lose oh are you a yankees fan no i'm a mets fan you're a mets fan but uh i mean i think it's i  feel good for texas though because they you know i've never been in the series so yeah stevie hey what's  going on oh how about instead of invisible sun invisible everything there you go i heard you come in  this time kenny so i mean you didn't really scare me messaging a bottle thick glasses 
[01:15:30]  i don't know so what was the yankees problem there stevie you're a sports guy we'll give you  a chance here did you see anything all right yeah well i watched i mean you know good one they got we  were out pitched i felt that texas had a little more depth and uh i mean perception  i mean um you know they they had a lot of guys who really came through i think the yankees uh  really just couldn't put it together and texas has you know destiny on their side i think so destiny 
[01:16:00]  well i mean yeah they beat the yankees so you know deals happened before yeah but a rod sucks  a rod does he's terrible in the clutch oh my god if you're a yankees fan you gotta  fucking hate a rod just gotta they did they did they did just completely outplay the yankees  you couldn't blame it on anything no except the fact that they completely outplayed them  that's it oh well who wins the world series now um  texas don't know enough about uh gotta go texas right giants don't know enough about uh 
[01:16:30]  you don't care enough to and i just i so don't give a shit boy i'll tell you a cable vision is is  fucking lucky the yankees didn't win because uh wait people are still not getting those channels  yeah yeah yeah still they haven't even spoken fox and cable vision have not had a meeting or  spoken since like thursday fox is encouraging people to get converters and watch their shows  for free yeah and uh the fcc is getting involved now oh this could be great by the end of today 
[01:17:00]  if they haven't spoken they're going to investigate if they have um agreed to speak in good faith and and  just you know try to protect the consumer what a fucking asshole is not even talking i know  but this could break up the uh the cable companies a little bit they're raping us  it already has the cable companies are broken up if you're still paying over a hundred dollars a  month for cable they they still are taking advantage of us you could leave cable vision though now 
[01:17:30]  which is great right you don't have to sit there you got options you know how many people are going  to go to fucking fios i know because of this oh yeah that's what made me switch was the time  they cut abc off and i didn't even give a shit but it was just the principle of the whole thing  and a lot of people saying this is completely fox's fault really completely fox's fault i don't care  i don't give a shit i i pay for a service i want that service and uh if they can't figure out some way  to deliver fox over their cable uh network then fuck them i'm i'm i'm leaving your your system 
[01:18:00]  that's what i did goodbye goodbye see ya uh let me say hi to bill in texas he's not happy with us  bill what's wrong oh bill uh well i gotta i gotta start by saying i know this is gonna sound corny  but i don't give a shit i fucking love all three of you guys i have to listen to you every day but  anyways sweet i hate to be this guy all right why is it that uh every year i mean what was it last year  the two years ago when the uh tampa bay rays went to the uh world series if it's not the northeast 
[01:18:30]  teams going to the world series you guys say that nobody's going to watch and who gives a  yeah that's true come on give us a chance well i i think major league baseball is bummed that the  yankees or phillies are not in the world series yeah those are huge baseball markets i get sure texas  is a big market yeah you guys don't seem like the rest of the country uh grabs on to uh the rangers  when their team's not in it and a team like the yankees people will watch to root against 
[01:19:00]  like you have to think to cowboys too like there's certain teams that even if you don't care about  either team you'll watch just to watch that team get their their ass kicked the yankees are a team  people will watch just to hope they lose yeah when tampa bay was in the world series who cared except  for people that live in that area i i can't make the same argument with texas i'm sure that there's more  fans spread out past texas but when you talk about tampa bay really there's a ton of people in the  new york area that care that tampa bay's in the world series yeah tampa bay doesn't even care 
[01:19:30]  although the giants is a big city too i mean san francisco yeah so maybe maybe it's just us this  time i don't know baseball city though san fran yeah yeah it seems like it they got a lot of history  yet mad dog must be happy he's gotta be out of his mind that's right we should get mad dog on the air  mad dog loves he loves the giants favorite team  i'm punching yeah i don't know what to do with this bill i don't know well i don't really i'd never  follow the texas rangers no giants a little bit because they're if it's not the northeast teams you 
[01:20:00]  guys you guys always exactly it's it's not just us guys it's fucking advertisers it's uh the networks  it's they they see it in the ratings all right it just doesn't seem to be um as as big a hoopla  as when the yankees are in it or the red sox are in it yeah phillies yankees giants would have  been kind of cool huh yeah that would have been good that would have been a good series  fucking back and forth flying though that would have been amazing kills them so yeah it would have 
[01:20:30]  been a cool one to watch those giants yankees i would have been very interested in that yeah so would  all right i love you jimmy bye thank you mister as you should all right bill  i'm not wearing my yankee hat either i saw that it's retired it's retired for the rest of the uh  the year until baseball season exactly leaving the fucking closet why am i gonna  what am i gonna they don't win i don't wear it silly to wear it now silly it's still baseball 
[01:21:00]  no it's not yankee baseball you know what the appeal for the world series is to me it's that two  teams have never won the world series before yeah and so you're going to see one team like  the giants won back when they were in new york but they haven't won since they were in san francisco  so you're going to see you know one team that's never won it so that's a good story i'd love to  see what yeah i would like to see the giants over the rangers the giants whether padded the giants  whether i love that guy that was uh don't you hate guys that like just tell you things everybody  knows that was after a little home run yes that uh and they give you bobby chip thompson 
[01:21:30]  let's say hi to sean in georgia sure will you assholes do jocktober oh yeah yeah oh do we keep  cheesing this one sorry right after the break we'll do jocktober with john and jeff 
[01:22:00]  i say we do jocktober this is the last week of jocktober for this year that went really really  fast it's blue as sam runs down the whole uh the hall excuse me really quickly after 31 years i i can't  believe this is happening here sony is discontinuing the cassette tape walkman  how who the fuck is still buying that who knew they were still making them i had no idea i bought  one a while ago but i wanted to hear my cassette tapes and try to put them on the computer but it was 
[01:22:30]  surely because i had to do it that's crazy isn't that weird yeah there are plenty of every time i saw  one which was very rare you would you just assumed there was someone's old cassette walkman last time  i saw that um uh darth vader had come down from the planet vulcan and was using it to melt um  yes george mcfly's brain uh jocktober sam who are we uh featuring mystery show oh it's a mystery show 
[01:23:00]  today that's good that means you're behind uh we're behind on jocktober so oh yeah can we do two  today if you really wanted to do you have one standing by or no i would have one can if you  said you wanted to do two we would do we might just do two because we haven't done one in a while  now all right well here's the mystery show anthony to start off today's jocktober we don't need the  fucking intro why not let's just get right into it we're two guys who think there is no excuse for 
[01:23:30]  poor neighborhoods being dirty we're two guys who think any band that comes back after a farewell tour  should be sued we're two guys who think parole boards should be eliminated we're two guys who  think children's beauty passions are comfort food for perverts we're two guys that would have never 
[01:24:00]  taken a risk in our professional lives we're on am station somewhere in this bumfuck they're broadcast  at la really are they on i'm pretty sure are they on in la i think so yeah they're third shifters oh  yeah they're on it like three in the morning oh yes oh they're not even on at midnight i think i  think they're on all all night all night long they just play them over and over yeah nobody's listening  nobody cares we're two guys who believe that if you put bread in the toaster it comes out toasty 
[01:24:30]  wow it's crazy really now you're talking crazy john and jeff desperately try to start a topic no  bits of information or conversation that is humorous or interesting this is john and jeff's thing like  they don't do those two guys promos anymore but what they still do and what i've always enjoyed  most about them are the subtleties which is they have all this air time and they just stretch  everything everything is just filler just shut up we're talking about john and jeff john and jeff exactly 
[01:25:00]  what about john and jeff no john and jeff see what i did there see see what i did we had a blind  kid reading off a computer perfectly all right no the open anthony show are just topic after topic  after talk boom boom boom i mean this is a great show john and jeff not as much all right  all right according to the u.s census there's been a sharp increase in the number of unmarried people 
[01:25:30]  living together how big of an increase well within a year it's increased by 13 and i got a feeling it  has a lot to do with people trying to consolidate their bills if two people are dating and they both  are paying rent someone is going to come up with the idea of well why don't we move in together and  save some money and apparently that seems to be very popular right now so more americans who are  unmarried or living together than ever before and some people are saying it's the economy or maybe 
[01:26:00]  some people need that as the i see the filler part this should have been five seconds you do this  story and then you start repeating it over and over it's endless yeah monotonous wow i thought it was  done and you know let's go to the phones or something there are no that's the problem there are no no  phone calls so the part of the radio show that you kind of just repeat the topic to try to get people  to call in that's the whole show yeah yeah but more people ever than ever before that's been 
[01:26:30]  happening for well over 20 years this is not a new story even this story at its root has problems sure  we're two guys who pray that our computers never get confiscated yeah kevin from connecticut or maybe  some people need that as the excuse to do this i know many families have very strict rules about moving  in before getting married and so forth but maybe the economy the recession has uh made people say 
[01:27:00]  okay we understand it's a financial issue many people have lost their jobs many people are  underemployed they were doing him they were doing this before the economy shit the bed what are they  talking about but he's just saying things many people have uh like for instance lawnmower salesmen  are probably not selling as many lawnmowers exactly in the winter where it may be colder in a lot  of places even though the grass is still growing uh in many regions although with winter months  coming up it should tame down the grass growth for the lawnmower people um which would mean they 
[01:27:30]  wouldn't sell as many and not selling as many they wouldn't have as much money shut up we hear the  stretch though in a minute and a half he's restated four times that the fact that people are living  together without getting married may have to do with the economy economy and they also said many families  don't allow this to happen i don't know one family that doesn't allow this happen but you know what  it could be allow this to happen if not the families a lot of it is the economy uh people uh uh consolidating 
[01:28:00]  bills uh yes yes it's easier to uh run a household with two incomes yeah uh hence the living together  portion of this conversation well a lot of people are trying to do a dual income household  so there would be two incomes in this economy we get it too many people have lost their jobs many  people are underemployed and as a result i think a lot of people are looking at their finances saying 
[01:28:30]  hey we could save a lot of money oh my god how many times you're gonna say it is the other guy asleep  has he nodded off well maybe i don't know holy fuck the redundancy he just keeps going i'm so glad i'm  not high listening to this because you just said there go didn't you just say that  i'm not sure he just said this is a five second news story yeah you're supposed to just read off  the story and then go straight to the callers but when you have no callers and you're like you allot 
[01:29:00]  15 minutes for a story hoping there will be callers there are no callers but you still must allot the  15 minutes there's a lot of callers i don't think so we might get to that point hey we could save a  lot of money if we move in together so a sharp increase in the number of unmarried wow it's like  a book report yeah now he's summarizing is he alone no it's john and jeff he's terrible you know like  is jeff having a a fezzy moment right there where's he on his fucking he's on his computer looking at uh 
[01:29:30]  photos from thailand looking up flights to thailand yeah sharp increase in the number of unmarried  people shacking up yeah they used to say back in the 70s oh they're shacking up they're living in  sin they've moved in together yeah they're probably doing it and they're not even married i remember  hearing those conversations talking about youtube because i have brothers that are 10 years older 
[01:30:00]  back in the 70s and it was kind of like you hear about so and so yeah they moved in together  holy fuck we can't do jock tover anymore it's too enraging for everybody for us the listeners  for john and jeff it just makes me sad it does right it upsets you like they're shacking up  they're doing it doing it really were they that shocked in the 70s like you were doing you know  when aids was pretty much invented while john is doing this whole story he's taking five minutes to 
[01:30:30]  tell it jeff is just sitting there okay think of something interesting think of something  oh shacking up thing yeah that's wrong no he started with in america oh uh they fill more  time with the news story out of texas john and jeff are ladies yes you go to texas here uh and a 14  year old boy was caught trying to steal a pair of head what's a cot he was caught caught  trying to steal a pair of headphones at a uh department store head his parents came up with 
[01:31:00]  a creative punishment they made him listen to this program through his ill-gotten headphones  till his head blew off like scanners he shot himself like that kid listening to judas priest  uh these guys are awful it's just penance it really is fucking purgatory i understand it's  very late at night but uh it's the third shift no zero energy there there is zilchoid energy 
[01:31:30]  darrett scott from garden city this is literally just some cunts reading yahoo news yeah i would  assume that john and jeff have been responsible for deaths because of all the people who fall asleep  while driving off driving yeah like it's late at night and you're driving and john and jeff come  on i bet that because of them people have died yeah like one of those dopes on the new york  radio message board would say this is not appointment radio is that what they say appointment radio  something you have to be appointment radio i guess that means that it's it's a destination radio must 
[01:32:00]  listen god what are they talking about on the new york radio message yes i want to know the topic  shit we haven't gone there in a while i have not even looked at that in years it's on the list of  it's on the list of websites i just don't go that's just simply why go hideous right will so-and-so  play standards on hd why make him a fuck why make up the topics when they're right there in front of  you you want to enjoy this one once you read through the uh the topics again they can't get away 
[01:32:30]  from it standards on terrestrial radio they've been talking about standards standards  suck it's an awful format here's one happy birthday mitch lieb l-e-b-e yes i guess john  bachelor's doing a show from the hard rock cafe cool yeah and uh wait did you do the weird one that  at the top w uh congratulations to tell w fme 94.7 says the world will end next year oh well

[01:33:30]  while exactly i think people are just getting sick and tired of fucking nitpicky alan going over  every line and quoting it and correcting everybody what an ocd zilch his power hungry days oh he's the  fucking worst now it's just nothing he has to be heard exactly as he means to be heard yeah get a  radio show shithead it's alan sniff and hey board reflections used to rule it's board reflection 
[01:34:00]  they're so terrible welcome to another episode of board reflections i am alan sniffen yeah who enjoys  that alan sniffen that's probably gets 50 listens a month he uh was very early on with the podcast  though yeah i guess he was podcasting way before anyone else let's say hi to andy in cleveland andy  let's go it's andy in cleveland andy these guys uh these guys have all the energy and pacing of an 
[01:34:30]  npr pledge break oh john and jeff yeah yeah it's it's 30 seconds of we need your money stretched out  over an entire afternoon yeah someone said we sort of said it too but it's like an eighth grade book  report where you say the same thing in different words over and over just to get to the required  one thousand words we all did that trick wow and then hoffman in virginia regular writes uh we're  two guys who are surprised that so many non-married people are living together we just don't get it 
[01:35:00]  want to go back to the uh oh please where were we the headphones or something yes  a young man in texas stole some headphones or his parents came up with a creative punishment  he had to stand outside a department store with a sign saying a large sign i stole why does that  matter i hate yeah i thought it was like die hard why would it matter that the sign was large it is  like an eighth grade book report like when you write he was very very very very angry trying to get to 
[01:35:30]  to the end of the line yeah it was a sign a large sign with large font oh filling space right yes i  see a large sign i stole a pair of headphones i am an idiot i won't do it again my mom and dad made me  hold it up so he actually says he's an idiot on the sign the sign says i stole a pair of headphones  holy that was a yes or no question why don't you reiterate the story wow so their thing is to 
[01:36:00]  just stretch there's too much time to fill there's no way you could just have a yes or no answer yeah  that was a yes or no question and now he's going to just redo the entire thing again you got to  on the sign the sign says i stole a pair of headphones i'm an idiot i won't do it again my mom and dad made  me hold the sign up wow wow wow wow maybe you should do the story again wow wow 
[01:36:30]  won't do it again my mom and dad made me hold the sign up wow how old is this uh 14 14 well he was an  idiot for trying to rip something off i mean come on we've all made that you know i mean we're too how  long does he have to they sound don't like shoplifting they sound like they're just defeated  they used to have more energy than this i remember even that energy sucked because the little bit of  energy helped push the shit out in the morning when we would shit right their show push it just fell 
[01:37:00]  out it just fell out your ass part of my routine open up like the bottom of the ships in independence day  my favorite time period for john and jeff is when the catch a uh pedophile shows were on nbc oh and  they literally dodging them they must they must have pulled every single clip from that show because  they spent upwards of six weeks every day at the exact same time 5 30 playing clips from the catch a 
[01:37:30]  pedophile wow great stuff we've all made that you know i mean how long does he have to hold that sign  for he did it for a few hours how about a few days i i say hey that's good discipline coming from the  parents i stole a pair of headphones i am an idiot i won't do it again my mom and dad made me hold we  know sign up we know what the sign says at this point well some tough love for uh would you do that to 
[01:38:00]  your kid i don't think i would i don't want to humiliate humiliate my child listen don't tell  him let's show you  say you're on any other show don't bring don't bring him to school for what does dad do day  oh my god what the lards this is exhausting i don't think i would i don't want to humiliate my  child listen if you have to humiliate your child to do the right thing then you're a bad parent well 
[01:38:30]  hopefully he'll never do it again are you really humiliating him well i hope is that bad for the  kid really a couple hours with a stupid sign in front of a store who cares there's other ways to  punish oh good spanking it's inappropriate it's not your kid can we move on i don't want to do this  why what's wrong it's too it's the pace of the whole thing is horrendous you mean it's  monday to begin with so we're so good a little slower than usual no this is good it makes us seem 
[01:39:00]  like we're very peppy today okay yeah yeah john and jeff i'll just talk a little louder a little  faster we'll get the energy going well that's great john and jeff try to get people to call in and  and anyone do anything they try to get people to call in and no one does no one does oh i like  these clips because you could talk fast like between the cliffs get the energy up and as soon  as you hit that clip back here's john and jeff uh trying to get people to call in there are many 
[01:39:30]  people right now jeff insomniacs on the third shift they can't sleep because their significant  other is snoring right now they smell like they're they sound like a barge oh my god they're  gonna try to do a bit whoever has people who are snoring next to them those would be the people  listening to the radio show look when you when you decide to do a radio bit you gotta you gotta make  sure that the the pool is very large to pick from so they're looking for people that just happen to be 
[01:40:00]  awake their spouse is snoring and they're listening to john and jeff yeah on the third shift  there's got to be maybe one person unbelievable maybe yeah that person doesn't call is snoring  right now they smell they they sound like a barge when they sleep and so yeah you get it's a big  problem you do and and women snore too it's not just the guys because the guys call on logs women  man they can they can make some noise as well they say if you have a big beer belly the odds of you  snoring go up exponentially that's what they say really yeah you're you're because you're cutting 
[01:40:30]  off hibernating bear you know why because there's so much weight on your chest that it's forcing you  to gasp for air and so it's a little bit more difficult for guys that have like this show  to sleep and not snore yeah if your name is cliff you you're pretty hardy sleeper and you uh sleep  pretty loud if your name is cliff yeah we get it when you said cliff the first time yes i'm gonna say  it twice cliff they're the beer billies of radio cliff cliff cliff something about a cliff when your name

[01:44:30]  or pull them they might make a noise why didn't you call into john and jeff you could have i wish i was  i was unconscious belly just sleep and not snore yeah if your name is cliff you you're pretty hardy  sleeper and you uh sleep pretty loud if your name is cliff cliff 877-975-6465 and maybe you  are with someone who snores a lot what's it like with someone in the house in the bedroom and they're 
[01:45:00]  preventing you from getting a good night's sleep wow no wonder people are sleeping in different  bedrooms because they can't get a good night's sleep sleeping together that means you're sleeping  in a different bedroom ass this is how do you know that other people are sleeping in different  bedrooms he had to say in the house as opposed to where on the roof that added nothing but if he  hadn't said in the house that would have been 15 more seconds of air time that needed to be filled  so where are the phone calls of people calling about snoring i don't see it in front of me here sam 
[01:45:30]  well i was failed miserably what happened here's a problem i didn't fail this time i listened to the  show they moved on to another topic there were no oh so they didn't get a call they didn't get one  call so they had to move on with some more horse shit not one phone call so they moved on with uh  hideous oh they moved on with third shift trivia this should be good well this is i like trivia  anthony likes trivia love it jimmy loves trivia my nickname was the trivia kid tell him no i mean  they would call me that in high school they would do the the egyptian hands when i walk by 
[01:46:00]  oh oh shit it's the trivia kid  do the walk like an egyptian yeah yeah whenever i walk by it's the trivia kid  you don't bite my tk hat  well then hopefully you'll be able to answer this oh you bet i'm good i just said lickety split the  jericho mile yeah i just saved the show by the way how'd you do that we started doing the candy  bit and i i moved right the fuck yeah yeah we were we were seconds away from doing the candy 
[01:46:30]  bit which we made fun of all the fucking time that we did a little bit of it but before it became a  bit i said let's get back to john and jeff and that was technically we did not do the candy bit  assholes that was a list of the candies that jim norton ate at anthony's house a personal story  that is true not just hey jim right what are your favorite candies right we did not do the candy  bit officially i was a little came very close this was all about jimmy being a little piggy  i was a little piggy how many pieces of candy did you have somewhere around 70 
[01:47:00]  i couldn't stop i also had a lot of tortilla chips um what i had some uh you must have had  uh pretzels any pretzels you must have had some great farts on the way home  i had tea chips salsa and candy bars i had great farts one day ice cream the other night and the  next morning my i took a fucking pepto shit oh does it come out gray no it's black  black and gray you can't tell if you have a fucking blood in your stools or pepto 
[01:47:30]  it's like a fucking horrible discolored log sick log when you polish off like a nice bottle of  red wine like a shiraz and then you shit the next day and it's just fucking dark chocolate milk duds  yeah you want to you want to get the scare of your life get a little vegetable drink with beets in it  ah beets it looks like your blood is pouring out of your asshole that's lovely it'll give you a nice  fucking color in the bowl i should juice for a week i have been eating like a fucking hog how do you 
[01:48:00]  juice for a week i don't know how long do people juice for troy juices in the morning does he really  well troy's in good shape but troy also gets naked with authors yeah he's weird he is right he's  weird he's got some is there a new weird thing no i just he's just weird he gives me the creeps now  does he yeah why he got naked with ian he's juicing every morning that's just ruined it for  everybody jealous i think you're jealous no i got in bed with ian too but i wasn't naked  what kind of juices he have he makes whatever juice he makes whatever fruits he has he makes some 
[01:48:30]  bananas apples mangoes things like that banana juice it's anthony wiener right here in new york he  wants uh terrorist videos to be removed from youtube this is a big story and one of the terrorist  videos did over 3.5 million views how do you guys feel about that wiener dog youtube removing uh  terrorist videos when you say actual terrorist videos they all look like uh bin laden yeah i think  they should remove them what are they like what are they doing in them terrorist things blowing stuff 
[01:49:00]  up oh they're doing their thing yeah they're recruiting recruiting and talking about what  they want to do to infidels man what are you gonna do and anthony wiener wants youtube to remove all  those videos i kind of agree with them even though it's a censorship i i don't want free speech censored  but you know what i like those motherfuckers most people look and just are infuriated i can't see  most people getting inspired by it i mean some will but they would have anyway all right maybe right  you know i don't care i watch it and i'm like i can't get enough of watching them get blown up 
[01:49:30]  i love those videos yeah you can see a pack of them running like ants and some fucking target on  them i think you hear like you know videos they would take them down but it's other people who  use it like an echo chamber i don't think we should regulate this by through congress but if we're not  if we're going to stay out of it we're counting on companies like google and youtube to do the right  thing bill how do we secure the internet from terrorists well part of it is the self-policing 
[01:50:00]  here i mean we even saw going back there was a case not too long ago with someone on craigslist  using craigslist to solicit people in who who were victimizing so the individual people who are  controlling the content why you have to mention craigslist you fucking idiot yeah guy wants to get  blown you don't see that the difference between that and al-laki fucking inspiring the fort hood  shooting you prick youtube doesn't make sense because i one of my videos uh that's why your fat was  removed remember i've talked about it a few times in the last couple months and it's it's not that  bad at all it's a fat broad uh sipping on a very sugary fatty type drink so i go that's why you're 
[01:50:30]  fat and youtube big fucking message and red font you can't have this on youtube blah blah blah you  continue doing this your whole account will be banned and now we're talking about uh terrorist videos  on youtube someone what's the fucking difference who'd you speak to youtube was it a you can't speak to  anyone personally like anything else in this world i i wrote back and they never got back to me i'm  like it's the fucking worst and i gave a whole bunch of examples of other videos i'm like how are you 
[01:51:00]  singling out my video and here's a perfect example today with uh with the terrorist videos they're trying  to recruit people to kill people on youtube but my video is a problem it's just someone who probably  just didn't like you you know i mean it's probably one of those guys yeah but then you know they should  realize that and go okay i see what's going on here you know it's not maybe the person who made  the decision even oh maybe it just doesn't make sense though if we're talking about terrorist videos  today silly let's get back to john and jeff oh please with no other options remaining it's time 
[01:51:30]  for the third shift trivia question because their phone topic with the snoring thing failed miserably  they moved on you think so oh miserably all right america welcome to the show it is totally open  phones that means more topics better right all open stand by for stuff you will only hear right  here on a third shift here's something when you're when you're playing a acdc song to get everyone  pumped maybe you should have it loud enough so a little loud it's like way in the back  get pumped listen to the acdc in the background all right america welcome to the show it is totally

[01:58:30]  cleaning come off your back happens taking out the garbage this is like like that this is  definitely the same type of question scorch would ask they probably got it from the same prep service  oh no when are we featuring scorch soon yes come on i mean we've only got four days after today but  he's got the tv show so we could just feature him yeah anytime anytime i think we do radio show 
[01:59:00]  oh you want to hear his uh we do maybe we do a radio tv combo wow a combo platter for scorch all  right let's find out the answer here third shift uh trivia and i i hate doing this and i hate when  it happens but the average american will spend about 16 days of their life doing what  i hate doing what i thought he was giving us the answer there no not yet the question again is 
[01:59:30]  he trying to get more phone calls i know the answer to get some calls pulling a shit covered condom off  what's the condom i know believe me i'm just going by what they would say  well you have there's so much shit kicked on it you have to actually scoop it from the bottom of your  shaft by your torso what are you gonna get shit on your fingers you try to scoop the the one clean 
[02:00:00]  part of it taking off surgical gloves yeah you gotta turn it inside out yes you scrape your cock with  your fingernail because you're down in your fatty pubis trying to pull it off your hog but you can't  because you have a sialis arm on so you want to just because you know if you grab it with your  fingers on the outside your fingers are going to slip and troll through the shit on the tip of the 
[02:00:30]  condom so you have to hook your fingers under yeah if you don't hook your fingers under if you just try  like the roll down you're eventually going to slip and have a fucking fistful of shit as you're rolling  it back down it's just squeezing out yeah a big ring of shit yeah you gotta scoop it there over the  toilet oh oh fuck oh my god or just stand over the toilet and think bad things so your penis goes down 
[02:01:00]  and the condom just falls off into the bowl that's what i do 45 minutes sometimes i'll just watch  i'll just watch beheading videos until my condom slips off well that never helps you waste 16 days  of your life doing that 16 days of my life god it should be something like that instead of some  horseshit they're about to tell us don't judge well they stretch for time praying someone will call  by taking a very long time to guess an answer so no one even calls for this not right why are they 
[02:01:30]  on the radio then god i would love to call up the third shifters 15 days see they're putting  intriguing questions out there doing something that's gonna be something dumb like this blinking  or yawning or he doesn't like doing it big hint big doesn't like doing so  traffic lights i think i know what convincing a child not to testify 
[02:02:00]  he doesn't like having to do that  that's a lot of talking to those little rascals let's find out here it all adds up i guess the  average person lives to be i don't know what 75 80 years old now it keeps going up but the average  american will spend about 16 days of their life doing what well that comes out to almost 400  hours yeah so i'm going to say how many seconds is that break it down we could do minutes first and 
[02:02:30]  then seconds it'd be easier blowing their nose yeah yeah so i'm going to say because  that's it sculpting sculpting an animal out of blood boogers  scraping a blood booger that you can wear like a fucking bandana  so i'm going to say because you gave some somewhat of a hint saying that uh you don't like when it 
[02:03:00]  happens so i will say  that it's something that annoys people  oh my god  what's wrong  are you kidding i will say since you said you don't like doing it it's something that may annoy  people i know what it is waiting for the phone to ring  yeah this is that what it is john and jeff  noise people it's got to be waiting in line at a retail store you're waiting in line 
[02:03:30]  and you're just saying how long is this going to take you're looking around there's other people  waiting in line you're painting a picture he's painting a picture yeah but you don't have to  paint a picture for obvious shit everyone knows what waiting in line means no yeah they don't  it's he he brought me right into that moment if he just said like no that's not the correct  answer and then looked over the phone banks and saw nothing right he'd have the panic so you  you got to stretch a little bit they're just waiting for the phone to ring exactly how depressing  is that you do a radio show and the phone doesn't ring all you're doing is waiting and you're just 
[02:04:00]  saying how long is this going to take you're looking around there's other people waiting in  line you're the line is 12 deep or maybe it's waiting in line at the post office because maybe  we spend 10 years of our lifetime doing that because no they don't want to  who the fuck goes to the post office at this point oh gosh good gravy exactly maybe once a year  oh i think i know what the answer is yeah uh 16 days of our life deleting dog fuck spam in our email 
[02:04:30]  yeah speak for yourself  yes becky loves i got a bunch of those recently watch becky get fucked by a dog  i did too boy did i right sent from your mom my mother name is becky try this out  you know what might as well do the landlord landlord story now then we'll get back to john 
[02:05:00]  what no what do you mean we gotta get to the bottom of the gunna i need to know what it is  don't worry about it days out of your life figure out what the answer is we gotta give these people  some material we haven't given them material in 20 minutes they want to know what the answer  to the question we're gonna get to the answer that sam trust me but we got a dog perv on the  loose where do they get them oh they got them because look at the headline dog perv collared  i'll get it after breaking into tenants apartment sexually abusing their two-year-old  pup named snowball oh snowball exactly asking for it how do you not a long island landlord twice 
[02:05:30]  broke into his tenants apartment and sexually abused their two-year-old dog wow that was good  dog pussy that's yeah see what this guy looks like he looks uh very very creepy yeah mitchell  whatever of long beach entered the apartment in the house he owned and sexually assaulted the male  dog a 23 pound shiba inu named snowball fucked it right in the tuchus oh yeah  you think that's what he did with it you think yeah yeah you think he uh look at his balls he's 
[02:06:00]  gotta fuck it yeah because the dog had injuries on its legs which meant it was being held in place  oh you're not even joking no jesus uh mitchell 55 was arraigned yesterday on burglary and sexual  misconduct charges and bail was set at ten thousand dollars uh his lawyer did not comment uh snowball was  examined at a nearby animal hospital and showed signs of trauma including injuries to his legs  consistent with being roughly restrained holy shit why only ten thousand dollars for this guy 
[02:06:30]  he's wearing an nfl jersey too he's an eagles fan or a jets fan well long island so he's gotta be  a jets fan right nice uh mitchell faces up to 15 years p-e-t-s pets pets pets  faces up to 15 years in prison for the alleged burglary and one year in jail for the sex  charges so there you go we've all given in to the urge once but to do it twice yeah come on 
[02:07:00]  it must have been good uh dog asshole must have gripped his cock like a velvet glove you think  he did it in the asshole what else are you gonna do it's a male dog dog is a male yes i thought they  were docking no he had to hold his legs so the little fella didn't scamper away oh oh my god just  knowing your dick is just gonna smell like dog shit what the fuck that's terrible i bet the dog  was trying to push his ass he pushed his dick out like was he did he give him the old eye did he  turn around look at him and do that thing they do with their you know like when they're taking a 
[02:07:30]  shit and it's diarrhea and they're kind of shitting and walking and they're looking when their tongue's  going up he was just turning around looking at him what are you doing yeah who are you  you're supposed to be fixing the sink why are you raping me my dog yes you think the dog had to  rub its ass on the rug oh yeah do that that's how they found out that's crawl that's how they found 
[02:08:00]  out he was going across doing the heinie rub across the floor yeah and jizz was leaving a trail  and blood blood and jizz look like a liquid candy cane  that's all i got how do they catch the guy they didn't say how they you gotta tell us how they  catch the guy the dog had a bandage on a tiny and then whenever the landlord walked down the steps  the dog would bark and aim its asshole at the landlord it's his dog way of telling him i don't  know how do they catch him don't know maybe it was a talking dog nanny cam little nanny cam oh yeah it 
[02:08:30]  was a marmaduke his big paws tried to cover his gaping asshole and he couldn't  back to john jeff 16 days i guess of your life there's that dog in the owen wilson movie what's  that dog oh marley me oh marley and me yeah it was written by this landlord marley the tattletale  he should have called it awful landlord just wanted to put on his football jersey 
[02:09:00]  fuck a dog up the butt he would do it after every home loss  the dog would only be rooting for a good season  uh god damn  or maybe it's waiting in line at the post office because maybe we spend 10 years of our lifetime  doing that because no they don't want to open up any windows that's true there's 16 windows and only  two of them are open hmm okay the government at work all right john so you say the average american  will spend about 16 days of their life waiting in line waiting in line john 
[02:09:30]  that's a good answer but john that is not  i have so now it's up to you america all right america figure this uh third shift trivia question  out here it is if you add up all the time here it is the average american will spend about 16 days  16 days of their life doing what i think i know the answer yes fighting an erection at a daycare center 
[02:10:00]  waiting on inane answers to stupid radio questions  because this is taking forever david h from king's park opie he blew the dog  what i don't believe he was blowing the dog no he wouldn't be holding the back legs like that the  the dog wouldn't have to be restrained yeah he'd roll over he'd probably have to hold the  fucking legs down to get to the get you got more info on this sexual abuse the dog in their  apartment cruelty yeah well that wouldn't be cruelty to animals you know the dog would never press 
[02:10:30]  charges if he was just sucking a dick yeah what dog wouldn't want a blow job two in the morning  oh yeah when the dog's all sleeping yeah he's just like he's all tired having that little doggy  nightmare all tuckered out it's real this time yeah he chased a ball all day just wants to relax  he's got two of them banging on his ass no thoughts of fleas were bad his legs are being held he came  and it's his hindquarters he needs a heart's rapist collar yeah i'm on his tail 
[02:11:00]  everyone's saying he sucked his cock yeah so i guess there's more info on this story somewhere  else he had a fuck it a bunch of people saying he sucked his cock um now sam i know show me how  you chase the ball show me how you fetch a stick  sam i noticed that you uh you right here they finally get a phone call what's that about 
[02:11:30]  john and jeff they they let it loose on america so i'm sure they just had a ton of phone calls  coming in at that point no all phone calls are on the disc what oh all right well they finally get  a phone call i guess is what sam's getting at anthony one phone call for the trivia contest yes  let's go to anthony you're next on the john and jeff show hello anthony yeah i'd like to comment  i give them a great call you gave them a great call too yes uh i'd like to comment on the hostage 
[02:12:00]  situation let's go to anthony you're next on the john and jeff show hello anthony hey how's  you on john and jeff pretty good it's uh waiting for red lights okay if you add up all the time doing  things in your life the average american will spend about 16 days of their life we wait for red lights  you say yes good guess but that is not there's never a good guess if it's wrong yeah that's terrible 
[02:12:30]  that why is it a good guess you know you don't want to be mean to people you don't want you know  just because they don't get a third shift t-shirt doesn't mean they're losers i want a third shift  tat like jimmy tat oh hat you should get a third shift tat oh imagine that i would get one cool  yeah a little nice on the arm right under my rob zombie thing yeah well she got overly it is good  guess but that is not the answer i have here i thought i'd heard that somewhere before 
[02:13:00]  i thought i heard that somewhere all right we'll go to the next phone call oh wait that's right  there's only one person was it one person was trying to figure we have more people trying to  figure it out on our dumb show he was the only person that took a stab at it and and half the people  have already changed the channel so well then no they caught him with this one because i'm curious  i don't know after 30 minutes and one phone call how do you know it was 30 minutes i listened to the  show you listened to the entire show what were they doing wow they were bringing up other topics 
[02:13:30]  really yeah waiting for the phone to ring again they went to they just never did they went to their  news pile okay after 30 minutes and one phone call later uh they give up they give up on that  that's it i mean what are they gonna do they got one phone call on it that's all they're getting  tonight this has to be so coming back at live america you're right in the middle of the john and  jeff show and john had the answer to the third shift trivia question what we do in a lifetime if  you add up all the time doing things in our lives the average american will spend about 16 
[02:14:00]  days of their life doing this what is it what am i talking about looking for where you put  your keys oh that's a good one of course that's a good one he said my wife has a place where she  puts her keys she's very organized it's called a vagina because your dick probably doesn't use it  she puts her legs up in the air and she drops in her keys i also put my wallet in there and she dozes off 
[02:14:30]  and we put our umbrellas in there when it's rainy she sleeps by the door she's a good girl  she puts her keys she's very organized like that i don't have a place where i put my keys  i just put them wherever once you put them on top of the phones no one else is using anything  hang on your microphone  this one this one isn't even fun because you could hear that these guys are even defeated  and they they were doing the safest radio on the radio or commercial radio they're they are 
[02:15:00]  defeated you can see you hear it in their voices uh they had way more energy than this one i just  put them anywhere we used to hear them i don't care it would be great they got on a satellite show  and we realize what pigs they really are like all right topic number one what's the longest  shit you've ever held in your mouth we got to start there  yeah what's this what uh who took the biggest silo dump in your mouth what dominatrix  was she a goddess or a mistress your call is coming up next what's the worst 
[02:15:30]  shit you ever took on your chest they each have 11 examples we're two guys that think bloody  assholes on junior high school kids is a good thing  we're two guys who think that foreskin should have itching powder rubbed under it  they're just barbarians we're two guys who think that raped women should have rocks thrown at them  it's just they're the we're two guys who believe in sharia law 
[02:16:00]  they're just the worst people alive they're nice guys on regular radio but it sounded like  they're garbage we're two guys who think drunk driving into children is a hoot  is this real that kid made that basket yeah it's all over cnn today i saw that yeah not only did he  make that one he made about four different shots for for cnn yeah because it's a youtube video so  cnn's like these uh videos have got to be fake so they called the kids and and they decided to get 
[02:16:30]  a stadium and film it themselves and sure enough right in front of the cnn cameras they were making  them all day long well they long and they said they didn't even have to be there that long for  them to make the shot really yeah oh well good at something so it sounds like a john and jeff break  right here yeah yeah that's good i just put them wherever she has the same place every time she  always tells me jeff why don't you hand your keys up next to mine i'm like i don't know and then i  ball up my fist you don't want to be and crack her jaw with it i just i pay the bills just uh i put my 
[02:17:00]  keys where i want you dummy yeah why don't you hang them next to mine really yeah crack then i  fucking then i then i push her into the bathroom like vicky lamotta and slap her and ask her why  she fucked my radio partner she sucks his cock so did i  be told what to do no no it's just i i just i guess i'm not wired that way i just uh i'll put  i'll put them down but then i'll ask my wife honey do you see my keys she said why didn't you hang 
[02:17:30]  them up just say yes they're behind your stash of gay pornography  they're behind brazilian unclipped six  during your they were in your almost empty jar of vaseline that's where you dropped them  oh my gosh that was tiring that's it for john jeff where are they god you left them on the table 
[02:18:00]  behind your broth but you missed a great discussion yeah he asked his wife where his keys and then she  said why didn't you just hang them up yeah hang them up next to mine that's amazing radio we can't  compete with that she does yeah it's great stuff you ever have to look for your keys yeah i have  everyone has who cares i i have there have been times where i've um not put my keys where i wanted  them yeah and uh i guess they were somewhere else other than where i know where they normally are 
[02:18:30]  and as i was looking for them i realized i don't know where they are right so they were lost you  couldn't find them i couldn't find them exactly i couldn't find them it's probably because you weren't  sure where you when you put them down you weren't thinking yeah so i was looking for them because i  hadn't put them where i normally do hence them being lost i had to get my keys once they weren't  on the table where i usually leave them which meant i had left them somewhere else uh-huh as it turned 
[02:19:00]  out i looked in my sweatshirt pocket from the day before because i'd worn the sweatshirt yeah the day  before that they were in that pocket they were there they were there which meant that i had put the keys  in my pocket the day before and then i hadn't taken them out hey anybody uh you should have asked your  mother to check maybe they were uh in a box with a diarrhea you took in second grade she doesn't  keep my diarreas sorry she's got to she doesn't keep diarreas no no she keeps she keeps his diarrhea 
[02:19:30]  like those little science projects you're making a shoe box yes it's a diarrhea-rama  she cut a hole in it look through a little hole and see his shit yeah like a tar pit oh look there's corn  she puts a little plastic dinosaurs in them she doesn't keep any fecal matter she raised one  oh that makes me a piece of you're a piece of shit oh man this is a very childish show today it 
[02:20:00]  really is a lot of duty jokes i'm sorry duty tired i couldn't sleep oh i just laid in bed  wish i could hear the third shift yeah i wish i would have had this program on  that would have been out in a second oh that would have been a good one  oh my god you could stream them except on their website the station that they say hear us live  stream now and then it links to one of their affiliates and that affiliate that's on their 
[02:20:30]  website doesn't carry them anymore oh so you can't so when you click stream it streams another  show it just streams news which is more exciting wow hey you think this person's black  no a little bit no okay but a relative yeah i went to a wedding friday so there's some old  photos going around and uh someone just sent me an old photo and i started thinking i might have  a little black in my family which is almost impossible because you i don't think so look  at that you don't think wow that's black oh that was the screen the screen went on my black 
[02:21:00]  mary the screen went black a little bit like sand black yeah yeah that has some kind of a look i'm  not black i really can't tell in those oldie pictures am i related to a oh  i don't think so if you look at it i learned i learned uh friday that i got a i got a hitler  type person in my family congrats thanks he was part of the german army yeah and he had the hitler 
[02:21:30]  mustache it was big back then not blood though no someone that uh someone married my family oh  okay not blood though uh what uh just because they were in the army doesn't mean they were nazis  he had the mustache though a fan of the mustache mustache was big but that's what was told to me  i said wow that's a hitler mustache and then this person said to me on friday yeah and he was in the  german army yeah german army doesn't make you a nazi but if you have the hitler mustache and you're 
[02:22:00]  in the german army aren't the odds dictating that there might be some shenanigans going on with that  guy the mustache was very popular not just hitler had a lot of the service guys had it i understand  especially world war one that was hitler mustache slash german army that's my argument i don't need any  more points well i'm sure he was you know killing uh americans and and limeys and whatnot yeah but uh  as far as being a member of the national socialist party that's a whole nother thing not every soldier 
[02:22:30]  was you know a nazi somewhere but not all no no no but don't your odds increase if you have the  hitler mustache that's all i'm asking today let's put it out to the listeners do you think  great question uh well you got to say the question three or four different times yes it's  three or four different ways oh because some people had the mustache yes but didn't support the  viewpoint so you're saying michael jordan is a nazi oh he absolutely is whoa there's no 
[02:23:00]  doubt in my mind he doesn't like the heinz he sells heinz he likes he likes heinz yes there's other  things he doesn't like is he a racist or anti-semit oh yeah yeah big time anti-semit i don't even know  i love this that's documented what spread it it's my opinion end up on tmz anywhere else no they're  too busy uh talking to rich voss as he's leaving a shitty pizza place what happened at tmz i mean 
[02:23:30]  and bonnie with her tiny vagina yeah i wonder if she does that all right here's the pick here's the guy  jimmy all right there goes the toss that's the guy with the hitler mustache and he was in the german army  yeah yeah uh like shenanigans i don't know back then it could have been the style yeah it was the  style throwback they sure did love that little mustache oh can't wear it anymore what do you mean 
[02:24:00]  he can we just said michael jordan's wearing it but he's bringing it back for everybody commented on it  huh yeah but he's still wearing it he don't give a shit what people think he's got lots of money  it's uh getting closer i noticed getting closer a little bit thinning it out coming in from the  side a little just a little i work it slow enough people won't notice and then before you know it'll  be like does anthony have a hitler mustache i don't really i don't recognize he's been around dude your  next hand in the appearance you have to do that oh yeah last second shave it look down as you're going 
[02:24:30]  on set and just just put it out there to the world like this with my hand just put it out there to  the world and then just be hi could you please do that oh no why be very angry huh i'd never get  on the show again that's true but what a but what a way to go out fucking a patrice what was that angry  pirate yeah can we play that that was the best can we play that yeah patrice was the king of what  was it uh john gibson's show and john gibson loved it was laughing and then he has the most amazing tv uh

[02:29:00]  she's just a dope yeah but they throw her on there like she's an expert on all things women and all  things media all things funny all things everything go ahead sorry it's just tired there's a new mood  in the nation what nation the nation you know what we're tired of things that are just the nation is  people and you know i'm not the nation i'm just speaking for me and funny you're speaking for the  nation or are you speaking for yeah you know why because i remember six years ago doing um something 
[02:29:30]  against anthony opening because they were just so outrageous and their violent images to that they  put out to women was just what fun called for and now now i think you know you're trying to be funny  i think now people in this country are tired you know what i don't care if they're trying to be  funny that's what i'm saying why are you in that business i've been to your show once and it wasn't  very funny being a woman it was hilarious when you talked about that's why she doesn't like me i was  in the paper with her and the joke is hilarious called the angry pirate and the lady who wrote it 
[02:30:00]  in her outrage didn't even know what it meant and anybody who read it laugh because they know what's  funny you're not living in the context of funny you're living in the context of fire have every  right to be as funny as they want they can go out and try to be as funny as they want make as much  funny make as much money being as funny as they want this is what's happening there is a change in  this country people are realizing they have an opportunity to speak out and advertisers are listening  you're not talking you're not talking to who i talk to and you're not going to get paid as much money 
[02:30:30]  anymore sonia patrice that's what it is the marketplace more cbs radio firings they've been  on the they've been on a tear lately all right are they cleaning house or is this the pc cops run amok  you know what it is john you know what it is why you're reading that paper is the pc cops run amok  do you think she's a pc cop of course she is she's she has an entire encyclopedia of of her stance on it  but it's no passion involved it's not a real this just what she has to say we are outraged and fired 
[02:31:00]  and fired and fired name-calling i'm outraged i am outraged you should be i am a fool now if i  called you a fool ah a you know what i know what these people in this country who are the people  how can you think patrice here's what here's my question how can you justify a bad joke a joke  that isn't funny oh wait a minute wait a minute attempt that isn't funny doesn't get any laughs 
[02:31:30]  and is about raping the first black woman to ever become the Secretary of State of the United States.  Don't throw that at me.  Well, why not?  The attempt is what I'm trying to fight for.  The joke may or may...  Funny jokes and unfunny jokes come out of the same birth.  You don't know if anything is going to be funny.  You should attempt to be able to make anything funny.  Don't you think a joke about rape is doomed to be not funny?  It's possible, but I've heard them. 
[02:32:00]  You've heard a funny rape joke?  Of course.  I'd say a couple.  Watch my HBO special.  I'm pretty good at it.  Patrice says that if you're having sex with a woman, doggy style,  and if you hit her in the head just the right time...  No, it's ejaculate in her eye and kick her in the shin,  and she walks around like, argh, it's the angry player.  That's what she was trying to say.  A violent act of hitting her in the back of her head, her body...  It's called the donkey punch.  Which will then...  Why are you laughing?  She's outraged. 
[02:32:30]  It's called the donkey punch.  It's called humor that she has no clue what it is.  Oh, he's killing this bitch.  We have the same problem that Opie and Anthony does.  You can't say just anything on the air.  You can say anything you want.  It might not be funny.  You might get in trouble for it,  but you should be able to be attempting.  And plus, when is a crazy bum going to get an opportunity to rate the president's wife, John?  It was trying to be funny.  All right, Patrice, why aren't I hearing Al Sharpton complain about this thing involving Congress?  Because it wasn't involving young black women. 
[02:33:00]  Well, it was involving a very prominent black woman.  Well, where was she during young black...  Everybody has their agenda.  I was there.  I was there.  Oh, I'm sorry.  All right, excuse me.  But why am I not hearing from Sharpton?  Because it doesn't concern him.  It's not concerning him as black...  It's...  You know...  Come on, Al.  You know Al Sharpton has his agenda,  and it was perfect for Al.  Young black women.  And now she's representing just women in general.  She's not representing the nappy-who part.  She's representing just the hoe. 
[02:33:30]  The nappy-headed part, she has nothing to do with.  Just the hoe.  You know what, women have been abused publicly in the media for too long,  and people are tired of it.  This has been a beautiful response of just the general public saying to advertisers,  we're your consumers, we don't want to have to avoid everything in the street.  We don't want to have to worry about what radio station we turn on,  and there is some really derogatory, violent thing to deal with. 
[02:34:00]  That information, ma'am, is secondhand from someone making you aware  that someone may have said something that you should be upset about.  That's a shame.  Your constituents...  The people you represent aren't all victims in this matter.  I got it. Patrice O'Neill, thank you very much.  It's much bigger than that, Patrice.  I'm sorry.  Thanks to both of you.  Appreciate it.  Time for big politics.  I'll get out.  I know.  She really needs to be fucked properly.  Yeah, I know it's an old clip, but it still matters today as we speak.  It's ridiculous. 
[02:34:30]  Patrice was great, though.  He was great, and you know what?  That was, I think, his last appearance on Fox News, unfortunately,  and John Gibson ended up moving on and only does radio now, I think.  But she was the one that brought it up.  Yeah, of course.  So he was controlling himself as far as that world goes.  He knew where he was, but then when she brought it up, he said,  no, this is what it is.  And he used the proper terminology for that, too,  instead of getting down and dirty and, you know, street with the whole thing.  You know what?  It's infuriating to listen to her saying that the public is the response, 
[02:35:00]  and it's a beautiful thing watching the community come together.  No, it's you and your dumb fucking stationery that you write your letters on  and special interest groups not representing the people.  You're representing the smallest iota of a minority that has a loud voice  because you antagonize, harass, and extort the sponsors.  And she also was not, I guarantee you, she's not protesting movies 
[02:35:30]  where things happen or language is used.  It's just like, shut up.  Fuck you and shut up, you bitch.  I'm just saying.  You fucking bitch.  We're always on her radar, I guess.  Fuck her.  She sucks.  And a little inside info, I don't know if we ever said this,  but when Al Sharpton was getting involved with our situation with Homeless Charlie,  he did call XM, that is a fact, and started fishing around.  They kind of calmed him down with some offers.  Oh, he wanted his own show.  He's another one with a fucking agenda.  They kind of calmed him down. 
[02:36:00]  I'm not sure.  Ready to trade off fucking, I'll leave you alone if you do this for me.  Yeah, I'm not sure exactly how far it went,  but there were deals being made so he doesn't make a big stink about it.  That's how Al operates.  And the jackass that was in charge of XM at the time, he's long gone now.  Nate?  Yeah.  He was fucking listening.  Oh, I have a meeting with Al Sharpton.  It was Nate.  It was Nate Davis, I believe.  Nate.  Scared the shit out of me and Anne.  Fuck him, too. 
[02:36:30]  Nate Davis wanted to meet us, but only in a hotel room with his bags packed,  because he wanted to see what we were all about.  And he looked at me and Anthony, I'll never forget, and said,  I just want to let you guys know, I thought Imus should have been fired.  Yeah, I thought I was should have been fired, too.  I looked at Anthony like, oh, fuck, we got to go, great.  Just another one that we have to deal with.  More race coming into it.  Shut up.  I'm like, how do we even respond to that, and how do we even work for the company?  But then, you know, shortly after that, he moved on.  But, wow, how do you work for a company that believes that Imus should have been fired? 
[02:37:00]  I know, on satellite.  On satellite, especially, right.  Not for him.  Right.  Go ahead and glad he's gone.  He was a dope.  What a dolt.  Most of them were over there.  Stand him.  A lot of creative people, but the management was a little rough.  A little rough.  Oh, God, that was infuriating and funny at the same time.  Oh, wasn't that great?  Patrice just schooled her.  Who are you?  What are you talking about?  And Patrice went down because of us. 
[02:37:30]  He was doing some TV then.  They all wanted him.  Well, he'd have fucked it up himself.  You think?  Yeah.  Please.  That wrecking ball of a man.  Just put a chain on him and swing him around to wreck shit.  Well, you know, I don't know if I'd say it that way.  Well, yeah.  A little inappropriate.  Oh, yeah.  Sorry.  Well, I was thinking of this big black.  Oh, crap.  God, now we're in trouble again.  Great.  That's our friend Patrice.  I'm sorry.  I'd love him to be stumping to get the show fired. 
[02:38:00]  Huh?  I know, right?  Fire him.  Hey, this is Bret Michaels of Poison.  Hey, this is Danny McBride.  This is Jesse Ventura.  Hey, this is Jimmy Fallon.  Hey, this is Michael Chiklis.  Chiklis.  Hey, this is Pee Wee Herman.  Hey, this is Seth Green.  Hey, this is Steve-O, and you're listening to the Opie and Andy show.  Oh, what did I say?  Oh, did I?  All right.  Opie and Anthony show?  Good.  The old John and Jeff. 
[02:38:30]  Nice and soft like they had it, too, I noticed.  I think that's the gag, I guess.  Very funny.  There it is.  That's hilarious.  Opie and Anthony on a Monday.  Yay.  What happened?  Troy was telling you a boring story, and you walked away from him?  That made me chuckle.  His fucking...  Because you were telling me as I was walking out of the bathroom.  Well, you know, apparently he's juicing now.  Like steroids?  No, I wish that was it.  Oh, I wish that was it.  No, I was just drinking juice in the morning.  So I'll buy, I go, hey, but take it, some good juice dumps. 
[02:39:00]  That's all I have to say about juice.  It begins and ends there with me.  That's all you give a shit about.  And he goes, but then he perks up.  He's like, yeah, dude, you ought to do it.  I'm like, I'll have vegetable juice, not fruit juice, because it's too much sugar.  Should I really do it?  And then he took a step forward, like this was really about to be a conversation.  And he goes, you know, there was a really interesting documentary about how juicing cured cancer.  And I walked away.  He just kept walking. 
[02:39:30]  I was so proud of myself.  What was the documentary?  Who knows?  Yeah.  What's his name?  Who would I know?  A few guys have tried to cure their cancer with juice.  Exactly.  Big celebrity stars.  How about you?  Try chemo.  And then it didn't work for those guys.  Like fucking, what's his name from Little House on the Prairie there?  It was laying there, right?  Michael Landon was giving himself juice enemas.  I think so.  And coffee enemas and stuff, because he had the pancreatic.  Yeah, get it right up in there with an enema.  Jimmy, you ever do a vegetable-fruit combo? 
[02:40:00]  I prefer very little fruit, mostly.  I like carrot.  You do carrot and an orange juice, man.  Solid.  The kid likes carrot, celery, and a little bit of ginger.  I don't play games with juice.  It's all veggie juice.  Right down my gullet.  You've got to throw some beets in there and spinach.  Oh, no.  I like beets, too.  They hurt my stomach if I drink too many.  Mine is beets, spinach, carrots, orange.  I love a fruit juice.  Oh, you don't do it like it's a milkshake.  I see the look you're giving me.  Yeah, you do it for health reasons.  That can't taste very good.  I love a foamy juice.  It's not that bad. 
[02:40:30]  Don't get me wrong.  I love a foamy juice.  Don't get me wrong.  Like we were going to take it the wrong way and get all upset with you.  Where can I get a vegetable juice?  Stop thinking.  Like a V8?  No, a juicer?  No, like just go and get a juicer.  My body is a juicer.  I want a vegetable juice.  A carrot juice.  Go carrot orange.  No, no orange.  I don't play games.  Carrot with a little bit of celery and a teeny bit of ginger. 
[02:41:00]  Carrot, celery with ginger.  That's horrible.  That's what a man drinks.  And I'm going to stiff leg to the elevator.  Over here.  A vegetable fruit.  Like a Shivo McGreevy.  Let me have that.  Ann was lying in wait for that joke.  Did you see it?  It was a good one.  It's like they'll be finished talking about their stupid juice shit.  And I'll get this line in.  It's up on the sign behind the counter. 
[02:41:30]  Especially McGreevy because there's so many of the gays you could have picked.  Shivo, you kind of got to go with.  You have to go with Shivo.  It's a Quinlan or a Shivo.  Shivo's the go-to vegetable.  Shivo's the new Quinlan.  Yeah, she's the go-to lump.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  McGreevy.  McGreevy.  What else is going on?  Paranormal Activity 2 was number one at the box office.  Wasn't it?  Why would people go see that?  People love seeing those fucking dumbass movies.

Nelson  Paul Miller  he  went to  Harvard 
[03:12:00]  graduated  law school  Harvard Law  he  became a  advocate for  little people  and their  rights  disability  disabled people  went on to become  advisor to  Bill Clinton  and Barack Obama  and you went to school  with this guy  yeah  holy shit  what did he advise him on  I don't know  putting bubble wrap  on the corners of the tables  what did he die of  he got cancer  oh no 
[03:12:30]  Jesus  took two days  to kill him  oh god  oh god  yeah but I remember him  walking through the hallways  very outgoing  had a hell of a life  very outgoing guy  yeah  um  yeah  godspeed  does that look familiar  right there  that guy  that's the guy  that's the guy right there  I guess  yeah look see  New York Times obituary  he looks familiar  well  then again they all look alike  he's got that look  but he wore the little bow tie  and the suit 
[03:13:00]  what would you wear a bow tie  if you were a dwarf  he was very  oh I guess a tie would hit the floor  he was very into school  working  of course he was  that's dumb right  I know  it's like why  I would have been like  why bother I'm a dwarf  I'm just gonna give up  I wasn't even a dwarf  and I gave up  what am I talking about  I'm not a dwarf  and I said that  I'm a dwarf  I'm a dwarf  why does god give a guy  like that cancer  I don't know  he's got enough to deal with  he's got enough to deal with  how long could he have lasted  why didn't he sooner 
[03:13:30]  that's the question I ask  that's the question I ask god  yes god  you know  I guess god needed  another bookend  you know Sean  remember Sean  remember Sean Stevens  from our show  the motivational speaker  from Chicago  yeah  in the wheelchair  he came in with his father  yeah  he made a viral video  now I guess now  he's all about making viral videos  instead of helping people  really  he decided  we played it on the show  remember the  the little thing 
[03:14:00]  that was in a wheelchair  and she was dancing around  oh of course  in her electric wheelchair  and it became a hit  so he decided  to do one of those  and it's a hit  but I'm thinking  he had a legitimate  like thing  you know  going on with him  he didn't need to do that  he's traveling the world  like you know  helping people  with his motivational speaking  how big is his video  I have a question  oh god  what do you do  you remember him right  yeah I like him  alright  well I'm gonna show you  what I do  and in fact  he's the weirdest  motherfucker  I'm gonna take it to the next level 
[03:14:30]  because I want you  to do it with me  I call it  a dance party  I call it  my tongue is too big  for my mouth  so  it's gonna start off  really simple  the shoulders  right now  and you might think  what is he doing  why is he doing this  I wanna hear the sound  of like a glass recycling plant  it gets your body moving  when his shoulder bones  just bust inside his body  it makes your spirit feel good  does it  so we're moving the shoulders  he is bizarre looking 
[03:15:00]  and then we're gonna start  to get the arms in board  yeah  what's wrong with his eyebrows  good  it's called a dance party  you really are  and his hair is mussy  and we're gonna take it up  a notch in a moment  you can't take it up a notch  you are a notch  what he's just  look at his arms  they're bent in the long spots  he's going crazy  and I have  because  life is meant 
[03:15:30]  to be enjoyed  oh don't get too close  to the camera  you're scaring me  what's that big thing  on his chest  his heart  alright  so now  you're gonna lose it  now in a moment  when the chorus  really gets going  you're gonna look around  make sure that  you're alone  when you do this  alright  oh my god  now he's just losing it  dancing really hard  he's not a good dancer 
[03:16:00]  though  I'm really  but why do you do this  he's legit  he doesn't need to do this  oh man  he kind of likes it  some woman is going  he's cute  I'd fuck him  that's why he did it  oh are you kidding  some woman wants to put it  it's called a dance party  and you do it  about three times a day  you just  get your favorite song on  and you get your move on  because  life is supposed to be silly  that's so serious  life is supposed to be silly 
[03:16:30]  exactly  that's what god thought  yeah that's why  he tossed you down here  I know this is probably  gonna be like  the most watched video  but dance with me  anytime you want  he's like a little monster  his personality is good  I like the guy  yeah I like the guy  the guy that gives out  personnel  I just don't know why  he decided to go down this road  are you dancing  are you laughing at me  you're laughing at me 
[03:17:00]  I know you're laughing at me  I would laugh at me  yeah we are  he's a likable guy though  his arms are like a shillelagh  anytime you want to feel good  why don't you do a new dance  called the limping man  leave yourself dance parties  life is too short  to get all serious 
[03:17:30]  and not have a good time  I'm Sean Stevenson  thanks for watching  do the twisted spine  I wouldn't call that  a viral video  no that's just  no that's just one version  I'd call it a mom  had a virus  Jesus  no he's doing  extremely well  he's a nice  yeah he's a good guy  he just comes off  looking a little  little odd  he's silly  but the man wants  to have a dance party  let him have a dance party 
[03:18:00]  if you opened your eyes  and that was standing  in the corner of your room  at night  you'd scream  you'd scream  I have a fucking  nice heart on right now  who doesn't  there's another one  I saw over the weekend  no arms  no legs  motivational speaker  with some kind of  nubby like toe  that's sticking out of his  where his leg  where his  how would you explain  where his hip goes  I guess  what  yeah  what's he motivate people  how to be  great door stops  this guy  this fucking guy
