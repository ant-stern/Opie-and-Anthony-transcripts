<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with immediate technical difficulties, specifically with the studio's Wi-Fi, leading to a profanity-laced argument with E-Rock, the show's technician, who temporarily left the studio.  The hosts then launched into their Valentine's Day weekend experiences, peppering their accounts with homophobic slurs in response to listener feedback.  Anthony recounted his frustrating search for a jewelry box, highlighting his expensive shopping trips to Tiffany & Co. and Bergdorf Goodman, where he encountered the exorbitant price of a stingray skin box. He also detailed a chance encounter with Yoko Ono and Sean Lennon.

A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to a scathing and offensive critique of the Grammy Awards.  The hosts relentlessly targeted numerous performers, using homophobic and racial slurs while commenting on their appearances, performances, and sexual orientations.  Their targets included Bruno Mars, Lady Gaga (and her egg costume, compared to a Vince McMahon stunt), Bob Dylan, Muse, Arcade Fire, Jennifer Hudson (whom Anthony repeatedly expressed a desire to have sex with), Rihanna, Christina Aguilera, and Justin Bieber (and his relationship with Usher). The in-memoriam segment also drew their ire. A recurring joke involved a "boner meter" to rate the attractiveness of female performers' outfits.  The Grammy commentary continued with further analysis of Lady Gaga’s performance (described as a Madonna “Express Yourself” ripoff), Miley Cyrus (criticized for her weight), Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez (with sexually explicit commentary on their relationship), and Janelle Monae.  They also discussed Esperanza Spalding's win and shared their opinions on Arcade Fire and Muse.

The hosts then humorously dissected a seemingly incoherent live news report from a local reporter after the Grammys, repeatedly calling it a "heavy bertation" and speculating on the cause, ranging from a stroke to drug or alcohol use.  They further analyzed Mark Anthony and Jennifer Lopez's seemingly strained Grammy appearance, Puff Daddy's perceived illiteracy, and Lil Wayne's tattoos and grill.  The hockey game between the Islanders and Penguins, highlighting the fights, suspensions, and fines, was also discussed.

The show transitioned to a discussion about boxing, fueled by a caller named Larry recounting a violent altercation between players in the Islanders/Penguins game.  Holt McCallany, star of *Lights Out*, called in as a guest, discussing his role, career, boxing experiences (including his brother's career), and work on *Lights Out* and other projects, including *Biloxi Blues*.  The conversation touched upon *Shameless* and William H. Macy's role, and *Idiot Abroad* and Karl Pilkington, with speculation on whether Pilkington was a real person.  Sugar Shane Mosley, joined by a film crew, discussed his upcoming fight with Manny Pacquiao, his career, and his opinions on other boxers.

A boxing trainer, Brother Nazem, joined the discussion, debating the best historical boxing match to watch before dying alongside the hosts.  Shane Mosley, already in studio, further discussed his career, upcoming fight, and negative online comments.  This section included a humorous discussion surrounding a news story about former Mayor Harry Balls and the debate about naming a building after him.

Vinnie Paul and Josh Todd, musicians from HellYeah and Buckcherry, joined as in-studio guests. The discussion started with light banter, including a photo Opie took with Justin Bieber, followed by a serious conversation about Pantera's legacy and Vinnie Paul's decision against reforming the band.  Anecdotes about a strange encounter with Pat Lachman were shared.  The conversation then became extremely vulgar and sexually explicit, with Josh Todd detailing bizarre fan requests for autographs on various body parts, and the hosts sharing similar experiences, using highly graphic language.  The conversation shifted to their Jägermeister tour, including a near-disaster with a Jägermeister tap and stories involving intoxicated women, including a naked, crying woman outside the building.  Caller Brother Joe's preference for Jameson sparked further crude and sexually suggestive remarks. The show concluded with the hosts promoting the Jägermeister concert, thanking their guests, and continuing their explicit and offensive language.

[00:00:00]  I 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  I would love to say we have the best job in America. 
[00:03:30]  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  It could be the best thing ever.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  Out loud laughs.  How do we explain the show?  We should start there.  Oh, here it is.  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony show, a popular radio program known for its cream style of entertainment and having very few limits.  Oh, shit.  This is a freak show.  This is a freak show.  Why would anybody want to come on this show as a guest?  Under the right circumstances, something weird could happen. 
[00:04:00]  I don't give a fuck.  Laugh out loud funny.  Which I love.  That's what I love.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  Because when you listen to our show, you know what you get.  You know what we are.  Everything has to do with cock or balls.  You know, the jokes all end up talking about cock and balls.  You're a waste of life.  Fucking listeners, go fucking die.  Excuse me.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people.  Real excitement. 
[00:04:30]  Wow.  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  What the fuck did he do wrong now?  Jesus.  Oh, E-Rock.  Will you get my Wi-Fi working?  You're being lambasted here.  I had no problem with the Sirius XM Wi-Fi thing.  Like other people.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  I feel like a reporter. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, God.  Oh, E-Rock.  I asked you before the show.  I just want to log into the old one.  Because I was having no problem with the old one.  But for some reason, now I can't log into the old one.  Because there's a top secret new one, I guess.  Even though everyone knows about it.  A nigger.  Oh, damn.  He pushed the mic away and walked out of the studio.  No, it's funny.  I'm not even mad at E-Rock. 
[00:05:30]  I just want a Wi-Fi.  I want my old Wi-Fi.  Did he get the old Wi-Fi working?  He wants French fry.  E-Rock, I'm not even mad at you.  What's your problem?  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock thought he was taking care of everybody by setting up a top secret Wi-Fi.  Even though the company knows about it.  And I said, I don't need the top secret Wi-Fi that the whole company knows about.  Because the old one, I never had problems with.  So then I tried to log on to the old one that I had no problems with. 
[00:06:00]  And I guess because there's now a top secret Wi-Fi that the company knows about.  Yeah.  It fucked up my login.  Now, Kevin is saying, let's see, he hooked up a Wi-Fi.  He hooked up a Wi-Pi.  No Wi-Fi.  All right.  I'm all set.  All set.  Oh, you're in?  I'm in.  All right.  You're jacked into the intertubes.  Oh, yeah.  You're jacked in like a hacker.  Like E-Rock the hacker.  Hey, E-Rock hacked away and got some covert. 
[00:06:30]  Where's E-Rock?  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  I'm not even mad at the guy.  E-Rock.  He's on high alert all the time.  He really is.  I'm not even mad.  I just said, look, I don't have a problem with the Wi-Fi like others.  All right.  Morning.  Welcome to the O.K. Anthony Show.  Sorry you had to hear that.  Happened right before the mics go on.  You know, it's so embarrassing.  Not for us. 
[00:07:00]  There you are.  Of course.  That was everybody's long Valentine's Day weekend.  Yeah, I took a day for love, man.  A day for love.  And then everyone's writing me.  Are you okay?  Should we get the camera off of you?  That's what I hear.  Yeah.  When people write a bitch, that's what I actually say. 
[00:07:30]  I guess people thought we had the whole week off.  When we take one day, they just assume we're taking the whole week off.  No.  No, that's Howard's thing.  Howard takes a lot of weeks off.  We take a lot of Mondays off.  Oh, that would be great.  That's where we're at.  We'd love to have the whole week off.  Jesus Christ, who are you kidding?  Yeah, we took a day, and I had to read things like, only faggots take Valentine's Day off.  It's like, oh, well, paint me fag.  Only faggots take Valentine's Day off. 
[00:08:00]  Okay.  Oh, my God.  It's like, give me a break.  It's a nice three-day weekend.  Yeah, and then a four-day week and another three-day weekend.  Yeah.  Yeah, baby.  That's what I'm talking about.  I'm going to try to take as many Mondays off as I can until this contract ends.  And then it's great.  See you later.  Okay, Steve.  Sayonara.  Yeah.  Yes, I'd be taking 90 Mondays off in a row.  I never said that.  He lives on. 
[00:08:30]  Huh?  He lives on in stupidity around here.  Did I tell you about the Stingray Skin jewelry box?  What?  I wanted to get my girl a jewelry box.  What are you, crazy?  Heat up things this Valentine's Day with the hoodie footy.  Oh, shit.  Sorry.  I wasn't going to buy any of that horse shit.  Still got that.  Who would actually buy that horse shit for their loved ones?  Oh, boy.  Well, um. 
[00:09:00]  You know what?  I went to a florist, and guess what?  They had plenty of roses.  Oh, shit.  Just as long as we don't bash right up until Mother's Day.  Oh, yeah.  The sponsors will forget about this in time.  Of course they will.  For us to shill their...  Oh, jeez.  Their fine stuff.  I said I wanted to see somebody laying dead wearing a hoodie footy with a fucking gold-dipped  rose shoved through their eyeballs.  Yeah, I did.  That would just be great.  I follow you on Twitter.  I read it. 
[00:09:30]  Tweetster.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Wait a minute.  Wow.  What is that?  Wow, wait.  Who's that?  Oh, shite.  What is that?  Who is that?  What do you mean, who is it?  That's...  It's Anthony's lovely sister, Dawn, sporting her hoodie footy suit.  Dawn?  My sister in a hoodie footy.  Let me try to make it bigger.  Oh, now I see that it's Dawn.  That's sad.  From here, the picture was, you know, a little far away.  Yeah, of course that's Dawn.  I thought it was... 
[00:10:00]  That's not sad.  She looks all right in that, man.  I thought...  Oh, damn, yo.  Dawn looks all right in that.  That's hysterical.  So they must have been selling these hoodie footy snuggle suits since, like, 1989, because  I see, like, there's a big, huge tube television behind it.  Yeah, yeah.  That's like...  That's an older picture.  You sure?  I think so.  Get her a flat screen.  Jesus.  Get her a flat screen.  Listen, so I decided I wanted to get a jewelry box.  Quick start.  So I'm thinking I'm going to go last minute shopping. 
[00:10:30]  I'm going to go to Tiffany's.  Oh.  I don't buy jewelry from Tiffany's.  A little tip from me.  Everything's overpriced.  Well, it's pretty pricey, but you pay for that box.  They're overpriced.  And I'm thinking the quality isn't as good as going to some other places.  That's probably true, yeah.  Like, you got your Steven Singer.  You're going to get a little more quality.  And look, it's not even a commercial.  He didn't buy this.  No.  Fuck him.  This is the shit I learned when I was going for rings and stuff.  And...  Cock.  And Tom...  Cock rings, right.  And Tom Colosino. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  Who I think might be in a mental institute.  I'm not sure.  I have to hunt him down.  Wow.  He's not answering his phone or his emails these days.  I don't know what the fuck happened to Tom Colosino.  But Tiffany's, I figure, go there for other stuff.  Yeah.  I just don't go there for jewelry.  If you want to go there for jewelry, you know, go for it.  So I go in there, thinking they would have a jewelry box.  They're going, ah, not really.  We have this dumb little black leather thing.  But we don't really, like, have a lot of jewelry boxes.  I'm like, what the fuck?  So they go, go to Berg... 
[00:11:30]  Berg...  Bergdorf Goodman.  Thank you.  Bergdorf.  Bergdorf Goodman.  So I go in there, which is a fucking extremely high-end department store.  No, we didn't say burgers are good, man.  Oh, you're wrong.  So...  Oh, we're kidding.  Come on.  So they tell me to go up to the seventh floor.  I go up to the seventh floor, and probably the gayest guy I've ever seen goes, can I  help you?  I can't do the gay voice.  Can I help you?  Yeah, there you go.  There you go.  There you go.  Jesus Christ, it never ends. 
[00:12:00]  He had checkered, tight pants on.  Yeah.  Like, fucking, some kind of checkered pattern.  Is that, like, in right now?  Yeah.  It was in back in 1983.  You know, Sam?  Yeah.  What?  How do you know?  Oh, boy.  Well, checks and plaids are very in right now.  Wasn't that big in the 80s, early 80s?  Like, skinny ties and tight, tight dress slacks?  Yes.  Is it in for who?  People who are into fashion.  Really?  You're not fucking inventing anything new. 
[00:12:30]  So plaids and...  You're dressing like the cars did.  Exactly.  Fashion runs in cycles.  Of course it does.  It's like Rick Ocasek.  Well, look at Sam, you know, you got a little of the grunge coming back a little bit,  too, you know.  A little bit, a little bit.  That shirt?  Well, not that one in particular, I guess.  I call it modified grunge.  Yeah, modified grunge is kind of hot right now, too.  That's mine.  So the guy in the checkered pants that's really fucking tight is, like, with the voice, jewelry  boxes, he goes... 
[00:13:00]  He looks at me up and down, and not because he was looking, you know, for fucking whatever,  but he looked me up and down to see if I had fucking money.  I know the look, and you know how I dress.  The look.  I dress like a homeless person, if they only knew.  So he gives me the up and down.  He goes, we carry one.  And then he goes, but it's really expensive.  It's really expensive.  Meaning, you can't afford it.  I'm like, well, can I fucking take a look at the jewelry box? 
[00:13:30]  And then as I'm walking there, all of a sudden I see Yoko Ono and Sean Lennon walk by.  Oh, really?  It was so fucking weird.  At Bergdorf Goodman?  On the seventh floor.  And then he's talking my ear off, and I want to fucking follow them to see what they're doing.  He's talking your ear off?  He's talking my ear off.  Oh, your ear.  But I'm like, why are you talking so much?  I want to go follow them like a psychopath.  Well, I'm sure they love that.  No kidding.  I'm sure they love psychopaths following them.  But I think they caught my eye, caught their eye, and I was able to blow off Mr. Checkered Pants. 
[00:14:00]  You blew him off?  I blew him off.  Oh, God, Opie.  You know, just pay the money for the jewelry box.  Goodness.  And then I fucking can't find Yoko and Sean anymore.  They made a couple quick turns, and they were gone.  Yeah, I'm sure they're good at that these days.  This guy with the checkered pants is trying to sell me a Stingray Skin Jewelry Box.  Danny went to the bathroom.  I wish he could see this fucking thing. 
[00:14:30]  Stingray Skin Jewelry Box.  That's very expensive.  How does Stingray Skin not just smell like dead fish after a while?  I don't know.  I don't know how they fucking do that.  But it's a Stingray Skin Jewelry Box.  Oh, great.  Thank you, Sam.  Jewelry Box.  Wrong button.  There's just some abbed-out black guys.  Oof.  So, do you want to guess how much it was?  Oh, my God.  At Bergdorf Goodman, the fucking Stingray Skin Jewelry Box. 
[00:15:00]  How big is this thing?  I don't know.  Like this.  Like 10 inch by 6 inch?  Yeah, something like that.  You know.  Like your standard iPad.  Like an iPad size.  If your iPad was a little deeper.  You know what I mean?  All right.  iPad size.  That had to be, I would say...  Stingray Skin.  And very expensive, Anthony.  Who would know?  I'm going $1,200.  $2,000.  Holy mother of God.  And now I'm mad because like when checkered tight pants guy goes, it's expensive. 
[00:15:30]  And I'm like, well, I want to see it.  You know, because he gave me the up and down.  Like, I'm not going to fucking...  I'm not going to like deal with you unless you're a real buyer.  And I'm sitting there like, fuck you.  I could buy this store.  Well, I can't buy it.  Great sales ploy though.  It made you feel like you got back in the corner.  Like, now I got to buy this to prove that I can buy it.  And in the end, he wins because now I'm sitting over the Stingray Skin fucking jewelry box going,  I ain't paying fucking $2,000 for this piece of shit.  And then he got to say, it's expensive. 
[00:16:00]  And then I had to go, you know, anywhere else that might have jewelry boxes.  Oh, under his breath, he's like, I knew it.  I knew it.  And safe to say, I finally found one somewhere else that wasn't a high-end store.  Yeah.  That was pennies on the dollar compared to the Stingray Skin jewelry box.  And speaking of pennies, that was the name of the store?  No.  You didn't get any pennies? 
[00:16:30]  And in my opinion, it was just as nice as the Stingray Skin fucking jewelry box.  In my humble opinion.  It was made out of flounder skin.  And then I'm shell-shocked because I got the, you know, I've been with my girl a while now, man.  It's, what are we up to, like six plus years.  And she's opening it up, and I'm like, I still am shell-shocked from the ex-broad.  You just don't know what's going to happen.  But I know she's not like the ex-broad, but I'm still shell-shocked.  You know how it is.  If you're fucking, if you go to war, you come back and you're in a normal environment, 
[00:17:00]  you still have that fucking, you know, shell-shocked shit happening.  Especially when similar situations or dates come up.  Right.  You might remember anniversaries of things.  Because in war, it affects you in civilian life.  You'd be like, ah.  Yeah, I know there's no way in hell my girl's going to cry over anything I give her.  The ex actually cried.  Yeah.  And I used to just, I'm just reiterating for the people that I don't know.  And she would cry, and I'm thinking, wow, she really liked what I got her. 
[00:17:30]  But she was crying because I was buying her stuff that she hated and thought was ugly.  And it happened more than once.  Happened with a coach bag.  A coach bag.  And a necklace.  And it was Valentine's Day.  Yeah.  Where we ended up drinking our faces off on Route 9 somewhere.  Literally on Route 9.  We left.  Not at a bar.  Literally on Route 9.  Route 9.  We left, went to a bar, and spent Valentine's Day just drinking and bad-mouthing our significant  others to each other because they were just such bitches on Valentine's Day. 
[00:18:00]  You know, stupid me.  A heart-shaped necklace for Valentine's Day is ugly.  Who knew?  What are you doing?  What are you doing, you crazy person?  I'm a dummy.  I'm stupid.  And like, even if she didn't like it, it's not one of those holidays where it's like Christmas  or anything where they're like, well, I'll take it back.  I'll tell you, just suck it up, take it, fucking put it in your jewelry box, and don't  wear it.  Suck it up.  Whatever.  It wasn't even...  It was nice.  Yeah, exactly.  It wasn't like cheesy or... 
[00:18:30]  No.  It was a nice heart necklace.  Yeah.  I didn't know.  I didn't know.  She didn't like it.  I'm stupid for trying to get a heart-shaped anything on Valentine's Day.  Remember, this is the X many fucking years ago.  So she opened up the jewelry box.  She loved it.  Yeah.  And it wasn't even expensive.  See?  Bravo.  Job well done.  A lot of people, they have a lot of difficulties around Valentine's Day.  Yeah.  And then we had the...  That's why Sherry's Berries, ladies and gentlemen.  I like to tell...  Oh, God. 
[00:19:00]  I just had those things going through my head all weekend.  The reeds.  Every one of them.  Those berries are fucking good, man.  They were.  I was just munching on a few last night.  Holy shit.  Delicious.  But what do you mean?  You got new ones?  Fresh ones?  No, same ones.  They've been in the fridge.  They capped?  Yeah.  Stay in the fridge.  Wow.  They kept for a while, huh?  Nice and...  Yeah.  They were fucking tasty.  And then, you know, I had the romantic lunch with me, the girl, and the son.  Oh!  The little family was out for Valentine's Day.  Just like the old days when we used to have candlelight fucking Valentine's Day dinners. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, my God.  Trying to acknowledge Valentine's Day.  Had lunch with my son throwing sugar packets all over the restaurant.  Ah, see, that's romantical.  It was awesome.  I wouldn't have it any other way.  It was all right, man.  It was all right.  I'm not a Valentine's Day guy.  I've written off that holiday.  Yeah, but you got kind of a...  You got a girl?  Yeah, but I...  Didn't you guys celebrate a little bit?  No.  We're both from the same school of thought. 
[00:20:00]  It's like, this is dumb.  Like, I understand people that like it and shit, but to me, it's just like, eh, you know,  you can get someone that punches their chick in the face every other day of the year and  then gets her flowers on Valentine's Day.  Doesn't make him a good guy.  So I'm just thinking, like, eh, eh, fuck it.  I think you're correct, actually.  Yeah.  I like acknowledging Valentine's Day, but yeah, you got to be doing stuff all year long.  You can't, like, just get flowers once a year or, you know, take her out to a nice 
[00:20:30]  dinner once a year.  And not feel obligated that, oh, now it's a pain in the ass.  Like, you know how Christmas is a pain in the ass because you're obligated to get people's  shit?  Sure.  That's how Valentine's Day is to me.  It's like, why am I obligated on this one day to treat you nice and shit like that?  It's like, treat you nice the whole time.  Have fun.  Joke around.  It's kind of like New Year's, too.  Yeah.  I hate New Year's because, oh, it's party time.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, let's party.  Woo.  To me, that's seven days a week.  There you go.  I'm not going to just put it to one day a year. 
[00:21:00]  That's craziness.  But I think you're onto something with the Valentine's Day thing.  Yeah.  I think you're right.  Because, I mean, yesterday it was just a, I did go to my local florist and there were  flowers fucking everywhere.  Sometimes I go in there to get flowers.  There's no one in there.  No, no.  The guy's just waiting for that door to open.  Oh, please.  They're always trimming things off of their flowers, hoping someone walks in.  Right.  Like, what is this?  This leaf has been bothering me on this rose stem.  When you're not in the store, they're pulling off the old petals of the flowers to make them 
[00:21:30]  look fresh still.  Make them look newer.  Because they're wilting away?  Because it's not Valentine's Day?  When you walk in, there's always someone arranging something.  Yeah.  They're always putting some, well, I'll put some baby's breath here, and then we need  the roses.  Well, the baby's breath.  Oh, hello.  Jingle, jingle.  And you open the door.  Jingle, jingle.  There's still a bell up there like it's 1850.  Well, the baby's breath is to, you know, to...  Fill it out.  Well, no, to pump up the flowers that are starting to look a little sickly.  Oh, is that it?  Distracts your attention from, you know, this area here. 
[00:22:00]  If you've got a nice rose, you don't need anything around it.  Yeah.  That's true.  Well, I was just, you know, we had fun.  I'm kind of bummed we missed yesterday because the Grammys were so fucking good.  Yes.  But you know what?  Every year we do a show after the Grammys, and we do our hour, and it's like, whatever.  But it seemed like this Grammys really was fucking good to goof on.  And we weren't here.  It kind of bums me out.  At least there was Twitter.  Yeah, we tweeted our ass off.  We pretty much did a Twitter show. 
[00:22:30]  Me, Ann, and Sam got fucking props on our tweets.  We were just tweeting like mad men.  And for the people that are out there that write the articles, we've been tweeting live  events for well over a year and a half.  Well over a year and a half.  We pick something that's happening on TV, and we tweet right along with the fucking show.  It's fun.  It's been around a while, is all I'm saying.  I'm not taking away from anything anyone else is doing, but fucking wake the fuck up.  During the Olympics, during the Obama speeches, the Oscars last year, the Grammys this year, when those big, over-the-top events are happening, we jump on our Twitters, and we fucking go with it. 
[00:23:00]  You know?  I can't tweet fast enough sometimes.  Something happens, and I'm like, ah, and then it's all misspelled, and it's horrible.  Yeah, Dylan.  I spelled Dylan.  D-I-L-L-O-N.  Nice.  Bob Dylan.  Dylan.  That's way off.  Oh, I know.  I just wanted to get it out there, but... 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, you want to get out there as it's happening.  I know.  Well, I feel like, you know, with the Grammys, you got to save your tweets before and after, because you know you're going to kill people with so many fucking tweets.  Yeah, yeah.  I think Grammy night, I did like 30, I think.  Or for the whole day, I think I did about 30.  There were quite a few.  And then, so yesterday, I fucking, you know, enough, enough, enough with the Twitter.  I had no idea. 
[00:24:00]  Ant was such a Bruno Mars fan.  Bruno Mars?  I didn't know you liked the guy so much.  Oh, yeah.  Love him.  You just seemed like you enjoyed it so much.  Just tweeting about Bruno Mars.  Which one was the Bruno Mars?  He's saying the little doo-wop, you know, the TV went black and white.  Was he the gay guy with the monocle that was making believe he's not gay?  Well, B-O-B, he was with Bruno Mars.  Is he gay?  No, he's not gay.  He has to be.  Not that I know of.  I mean, I've never met the guy.  But no.  And it's not about the monocle.  No.  Did he hear his...  The guy that had the monocle, I just tweeted, I tweeted... 
[00:24:30]  B-O-B.  Someone left Mr. Peanut in the roaster too long.  That was definitely funny.  That was a little monocle, and I was like, what the hell is that?  It's a little style, a little accessory.  If the black community starts adopting the monocle, then they've jumped the shark.  The black community?  Yes.  You know how white people pick up on a lot of black culture?  Yeah.  We're not following the monocle thing.  But we did the monocle thing many years ago.  But if the blacks bring it back, the whitey's not going to go with the monocle thing. 
[00:25:00]  No, we're not going to bring the monocle back and use it.  That looks like the biggest pain in the ass ever.  A monocle.  And even if they could only figure out a monocle back in the day, why wouldn't you have some  kind of tape or something so you don't have to squint the whole time?  You've got to hold it in with your eyeball muscles.  So stupid.  What a dumb thing the monocle is.  Probably one of the dumbest inventions ever.  A monocle.  That's why B.O.B. only had it in for one verse.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he took it right out. 
[00:25:30]  And then he popped his monocle.  Yeah, because you're giving yourself a migraine.  Oh, you got it.  That's got to hurt.  What?  You look at some of these inventions and go, okay, good idea.  But why don't you keep going with your idea?  Yeah.  Why make it where you have to fucking hold it down with your eye muscles?  Why not now go, okay, this thing makes me see better.  And all I have to do is somehow attach it to that area of my face.  I mean, let's slow down.  I'm not even saying, you know, invent the glasses.  But at least something that maybe tapes it down or whatever the fuck they had back then. 
[00:26:00]  A wire over the top of your head.  Whatever.  To, like, hold it there in place.  Right.  Something that comes off.  Maybe something that folds down from your big stovepipe hat.  How about some kind of...  From the brim.  Like, you know.  Yeah.  They had ribbons or straps or something.  They can just kind of, like, you know...  Wrap it around.  Wrap it around the top a little bit.  Like a pirate patch, but only a monocle.  Make a little groove in it.  Yeah.  Something.  Anything.  Dopes.  The monocle.  And what about the other eye?  Oh, I can't see with this one. 
[00:26:30]  But this eye's fine.  No, they didn't believe in that.  No.  That's right.  They made glasses.  Yeah.  But then you would think the guy would take two monocles, pop them in.  That would suck.  Do you think the guy, before he invented the little thing that goes over your nose for glasses,  like, that he just had two monocles and he's like...  Like, just trying to hold both of them in.  It's just an effort.  He's popping a hernia.  But, you know, he thought he was creating something.  So he went to that party with two monocles.  Two monocles.  You guys got one, but I'm going with two monocles.  My vision's perfect, and my head is splitting. 
[00:27:00]  A monocle.  Yeah, Grammys were highest rated in years.  Yeah.  111 million viewers.  There was something different about these Grammys.  Yeah, why?  What happened?  Was it the Lady Gaga?  The Lady Gaga.  Everybody was into Lady Gaga's impression of Madonna.  It was fantastic.  What was your line about the egg?  The egg, I was...  What was your tweet about the egg?  Oh, I said when she came out, I go, please, I'm hoping for a spinal tap moment where it 
[00:27:30]  didn't open, and a roadie's got to come out and start hitting it with a fucking hammer  to get her out of it.  The egg was slightly unnecessary.  The egg was stupid.  It was born this way, so she had to be born, you dummies.  I was hoping she would jump out and latch onto someone's face and implant an egg down  someone's throat, like Alien, and a little Lady Gaga would pop out of somebody's chest.  I tweeted, I thought it was very disrespectful that Lady Gaga came to the Grammys inside Aretha 
[00:28:00]  Franklin's tumor.  That tweet itself is not respectable.  What?  Aretha Franklin is not going to make it to spring.  Hey, if anybody could use that type of weight loss, it was Aretha.  Yeah, she was happy.  I'll tell ya.  Oh, boy.  Wow, did she lose a bunch of weight.  She is not going to make it.  Those cancer cells are going like, oh, I'm full.  I'm going to have to sit back before I have any more.  When they went to her taped message, and she goes, I can't be there this year, but I'll 
[00:28:30]  be there next year, there was silence from the crowd, because everyone in the crowd's  like, heh.  Yeah, she'll be there on that montage they did.  Yeah, no kidding.  Oof.  No kidding, man.  I was very...  And that montage, by the way.  Who the fuck were those people?  Yeah, not a bad year for music.  And by the way, Ronnie James Dio, what a diss that was.  It's like they're showing all these 19...  Wait, they didn't have Ronnie James Dio in there?  Oh, they did.  But they're playing all these 1920s black blues musicians and shit.  And, you know, that's all fine and well, but then they just have Ronnie James Dio in 
[00:29:00]  a little square with his picture float by with four other people without playing any  of his music.  Like, that would have been something to maybe play a clip from one of his songs and, you  know...  Yeah.  They were playing the Knack?  Yeah, they were playing My Sharona.  They were playing My Sharona when fucking Ronnie James Dio...  We lost one of the Knack guys.  Yeah, apparently we did.  I didn't even know that.  But what a diss on the Dio.  Well, no surprise there.  Of course not.  The Grammys aren't for, like... 
[00:29:30]  It's not about rock.  ...guys like Ronnie James Dio.  No.  Let's not forget the famous...  Oh, no.  Was that the MTV Awards?  The Jethro Tull in the heavy metal?  No, no.  That was the Grammys.  That was the Grammys.  Metallica?  Yeah.  Grammys.  It was Jethro Tull in the heavy metal category.  I was very pissed off that E! kept talking about how original Lady Gaga and her egg was when  Vince McMahon did the same egg shit in 1990.  Did it?  Vince McMahon came out in an egg?  No, Vince McMahon didn't come out in an egg, but he said, there's an egg here.  Can you believe...  What's going to hatch out of it?  And then the gobbledygooker came out of it. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, but he ripped off...  The gobbledygooker.  That was 1990.  That was his thing.  Yeah, but he ripped off Mork.  Yes, Mork from Ork.  Mork from Ork.  Yeah, but...  Traveled in an egg.  He didn't build anticipation using the big egg.  That was Vince McMahon, and that's what Gaga obviously got it from.  The gobbledygooker.  Gobbledygooker.  You know that...  Yes.  A lot of reports coming in that the egg's going down the red carpet, and no one gave a shit.  No one gave a shit.  The rest of the people there for the Grammys were like, oh, that's stupid Lady Gaga trying 
[00:30:30]  to get more attention.  I know.  It's like...  Oh, there it is.  That's a gobbledygooker.  See, it's the same gimmick.  It really is the same gimmick.  His egg is so lame.  That's a real egg.  That's a 1990 egg.  She had a futuristic egg.  Right, it's 2011.  That had multiple sliding doors on it.  Hey, man, if you're going to have an egg, at least she got a cool-looking egg.  She did get a cool-looking egg.  She heard a door...  Even though she's ripping off Madonna.  Everyone is singing.  Well, she's ripping off the gobbledygooker, but there was a door on the egg.  I'm ripping off Madonna's song, Express Yourself.  Did the gobbledygooker write Express Yourself? 
[00:31:00]  No, but he hatched out of an egg.  The gobbledygooker.  Yeah, that's...  Is Vince proud of that?  Well, now he should be.  Obviously, it's good enough for Gaga to steal.  Oh, God.  That's the outrage.  Yeah.  Yeah, great.  You don't like the Muse, I hear, huh?  No, I...  And I tweeted the Muse, and people are like, it's Muse.  I'm like, asshole, I'm going with the stupid Regis thing with the Motley Crue.  I know it's Muse.  Dopes.  No, I'm not into...  You know what it is? 
[00:31:30]  I've noticed, and from watching the Grammys and stuff, and just seeing what's in music these days...  And this is another thing I caught shit from from people, and I'll explain.  But I said, can someone please tell me when rock died?  When rock and roll just died?  Because that, to me, what is considered rock on the Grammys was not rock.  It's this recycled 80s new wave pop with guys with fucking sequined suits on, little skinny  ties, playing keyboard fucking riffs from the 83, and making it sound... making it try 
[00:32:00]  to pass it off as something new, and it's not...  No, everyone knows it's not new.  Oh, you know what?  They're just reinventing the 80s, but there's a lot more guitars than we had in the 80s  with that crap.  But it's not fucking like rock...  I can't say...  Wow, it's faggy rock...  It's fag rock.  It's not rock, it's fag rock music by these wimpy pussy guys, and then people were tweeting 
[00:32:30]  me, they're going like, well, Anthony, you gotta look around, there's underground bands  that are doing rock.  It's like, but that's my point, dumb fuck!  The whole thing is, this is the Grammys, it's like what's out there, and what radio's  playing, and it's nothing, there's no rock to be found, it's pussy fag rock.  Because it's based on... the old school rock is gone.  Yeah, I know.  They've got the lead guitars and the, you know, the fucking singer with his cock bulge 
[00:33:00]  and shit.  No rock radio in New York City.  No, it's gone.  It's just...  This is what rock is now, this is how it's defined now.  It's a bunch of faggy guys out there with, and I don't understand how...  I like a lot of the music that's out there, I just don't like looking at the bands, because  then I feel kind of gay.  Kind of gay?  Like, I like that MGMT a lot, and then I saw them do a little thing here at SiriusXM. 
[00:33:30]  They're like really wimpy, little nerdy type guys.  Artistic.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's the look, though.  And it made me feel uncomfortable that I actually like them, even though I love their music.  But I don't... I guess I don't want to actually see these guys.  But in a few years, that's going to look as silly as, like, looking at 80s guys with  the long blonde hair and the poodle hair and shit.  Like, that's just going to be one of those things that's like, ew, did bands dress like  that?  I like Muse, but, you know, to have a look to them that's a little different. 
[00:34:00]  No, do you like the Arcadia Fire?  I was fucking... I was having cerebral hemorrhage.  Arcadia Fire is really good, and this album they put out is just amazing.  The Suburbs, it's amazing. It really is amazing.  There's a lot of shit going on there.  And I loved all the entertainment shows going,  Arcadia Fire? Who's... what the... who's Arcadia Fire?  Yeah.  They had no clue.  You've heard the band before.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And that fucking... that redhead bitch from... 
[00:34:30]  Florence and the Machine?  Yeah, Florence and the Machine.  Oh, yeah, she's a lunatic.  Florence and the Machine.  But she's got some, you know, set of pipes on her.  Yeah, she's a good singer.  She's no Jennifer Hudson.  Well, no...  Dude, I want to have sex with Jennifer Hudson so fucking bad.  Holy mother of God, what the hell are you talking about?  She's lost a lot of weight, but it's how she sings.  I want to have sex with Jennifer Hudson.  It was effortless.  She did... they did that whole tribute.  Oh, that lasted a half hour?  Oh.  Half the songs you didn't even know? 
[00:35:00]  The Aretha Franklin tribute.  But she blew everyone off that stage.  Totally.  Christina Aguilera is supposed to have some pipes.  Fucking Jennifer Hudson made those...  the rest of them look like they're auditioning for American Idol or something.  Yeah, well...  She fucking destroyed.  She was up there effortlessly.  Like, she... there was no strain in her face with notes.  She's just like...  She might as well have been talking into the mic and just hitting massive notes.  Did you ever think you would see the day that Jennifer Hudson is thinner than Christina Aguilera? 
[00:35:30]  Christina Aguilera.  That clumsy bitch.  God, Christina Aguilera.  What happened?  She did fall down.  What happened?  I fall down.  I fall down.  I fall down.  She threw a shoe, I think.  She fucking came up lame.  Yeah, but...  Oh, God.  That fucking...  I want to have sex with Jennifer Hudson.  You know who is having sex with Jennifer Hudson?  Oh.  David A-List Otunga.  I don't know who that is.  Her husband.  But what does he do?  Otunga?  David A-List Otunga.  What the fuck is that?  What does he do? 
[00:36:00]  He's a professional wrestler for the WWE.  Oh, that's right.  I did know that.  No, he is a member of the Nexus.  I did know that.  What's his character?  He's a member of the Nexus.  And he goes by that name on the...  David A-List Otunga.  Yeah, I know.  The reason he's A-List is because his wife is Jennifer Hudson.  Oh, okay.  They make no secret about that.  They love that.  Oh, I'm sure they love it.  And I'm sure Jennifer Hudson shows up to every wrestling match, doesn't she?  I guess she had the Grammys, so she couldn't be at this one.  You'll never see her there.  I don't know.  She's still got some booty to her, and just watching her on stage, it probably could get 
[00:36:30]  a little gamey down there after a performance.  I don't know, man.  I don't know what it is, but...  Wow.  Yeah, you're digging her?  Her and Rihanna.  Holy shit.  Wow, you have the jungle fever.  Definitely.  You've got the jungle fever.  Well, I was telling you guys before the show, enough of these gay guys don't understanding  what a girl, how hot a girl could look like in a dress, because now they all have to talk  about what everyone was wearing at the Grammys, and the gay guys coming out of the woodwork 
[00:37:00]  going, oh, that was a fashion disaster, that Rihanna dress.  Are you kidding me?  Was it really?  What's wrong with you?  Gay guy?  Why is a gay guy...  What is wrong with you?  ...telling us what looked good on a girl.  That Rihanna dress was ridiculous.  He's looking at, like, hemlines and shoulders, stitching, and all kinds of shit, and we're  just looking at that, hey...  Everyone was thinking, holy shit, look at this thing. 
[00:37:30]  What was it?  It was like a, like a, like a...  With the white stripy things on it?  It was like white garland.  Yeah.  Oh, I'd love to lean over and punch her in the face.  Even Ryan...  Wait, wait, wait.  She seems to enjoy that.  No, I don't think so.  No?  No.  Oh, I thought she liked that.  Look, that's a rough picture.  I mean, you know...  No way!  No, I'm not a big fan of that shaved back hair that I...  I didn't even realize she had hair.  A lot of the broads are doing.  The broads.  You shave the back all the way up to the top, but keep everything else long.  I hate that style. 
[00:38:00]  It looks ridiculous.  It's a little dikey.  No, she needed...  On the Grammy, she had longer hair, and then...  Forget about it.  Forget about it.  Forget about it.  Forget about it.  But all the gay guys...  Oh, it was a disaster, that dress.  Really?  Fashion disaster!  Oh!  Shouldn't they just have a straight guy with a boner meter?  Yeah, yeah.  No, that dress is fine, right there.  The boner meter.  That's a seven on the boner meter.  Let me tell you something.  That dress is fine.  Let me tell you.  She was looking...  Right. 
[00:38:30]  I give a...  I give a eight on the boner meter.  There was no fashion disaster there, man.  I think we found a new bit for Bobo.  Red carpet Bobo is boner meter.  Oh, boner meter.  I think she's very pretty.  I would like to have sex with her.  But Bobo's like this.  That's all you get.  Anthony, people can't...  They can't move on with their day until I make a correction.  It's Arcade Fire, not Arcadia Fire. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, Arcade Fire.  Which I do know, and somehow I fucked that up.  So now you can go about your day.  Oh.  Now you can go about your day, okay?  Meh, meh, meh, meh.  Holy shit.  It's early in the morning.  Give us a break here.  And I do know it's Arcade Fire.  I'm sorry.  Jesus Christ, enough.  I didn't know the difference.  What else from the Grammys?  Oh, my God.  How about Bob Dylan?  Bob Dylan?  Bob Dylan sounded like shite.  He sounded exactly how he was supposed to sound. 
[00:39:30]  But he sounds like that now.  He's royalty.  That's the only reason everyone gives him a pass.  He's not...  Can I tell you something?  I didn't even know he was singing Maggie's Farm until the song was almost over.  Is that what he was singing?  And I went, holy shit, that's Maggie's Farm.  Oh, is that Liz Taylor?  Yeah, she's going to be dead.  I said dead by today, so I'm wrong.  Wow.  You might not...  Oh, by today.  Oh, no.  By yesterday.  I said by Monday.  Fuck.  Oh.  I thought today was Monday.  National Velvet Casket.  See?  It brings in one of a movie. 
[00:40:00]  I remember that movie.  And then the Velvet Casket.  Riding horses.  Yes.  Yes.  Maggie's Farm.  Now, I've told my Dylan story over the years.  And that place in Oregon where people are going to get...  Fucked by horses?  Oh.  My mistake.  Oops.  You've never seen Dylan alive, right?  No.  Yeah, we'll get into the fucking mush mouth in a minute here.  And then everyone beating us up about making jokes about that.  How do you not make jokes about that?  What's wrong with you people?  You know, she had a stroke.  Did she?  No.  They're saying no.  Turns out she didn't have a stroke. 
[00:40:30]  And even if she did, it's still hilarious.  She didn't even go to the hospital.  Like, a friend drove her home.  That's what they said.  Fucking idiots.  And it's hilarious.  She's feeling okay.  No.  It's hilarious either way.  I'm afraid if I laugh at it, I'll have a stroke.  Yeah.  You gotta, you know, you gotta worry about that.  We'll do the whole fucking stroke mouth.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Lady after the break.  But these people, like, you know...  Yeah.  Who cares?  It's hilarious.  I don't know her.  And also we got...  She's on live TV and she's speaking a brand new language. 
[00:41:00]  That's hilarious.  It was like alien.  She was speaking in tongues.  And then also we got a touch on how after Fedor lost that fight, he went out on a knife  spree in New York City.  Wow.  Thank you.  Did you see Fedor went around stabbing like five people?  Your information.  Really?  That wasn't Fedor?  I think you had something crossed wires.  That looked just like him.  It did when the appearance was similar, but if you read the whole article...  Oh, I thought he was upset about...  Oh, okay.  My mistake. 
[00:41:30]  It's okay.  Let's see.  So, the Dylan.  Yeah, yeah, Dylan.  Wow.  We got his performance with a little taste.  This is our Grammy wrap-up three days later, Grace.  Bob, what are you going to do?  We took yesterday off.  Bob Dylan, like I said, almost at the end I went, holy shit, there's Maggie's Farm.  And if you've ever seen Dylan live, this is what he does.  What happened to...  Lay, lay, lay, lay, lay across my big brass beard.  What happened about fucking four decades?  That's what happened.  Maybe he should stop performing. 
[00:42:00]  Actually, five decades, I think, for that one.  He, like, articulated that song very well.  And then it turned into, like...  And now it's just like...  Baby!  Baby!  I ain't got no way to do it.  I ain't got no way to do it.  I ain't gonna work on Maggie's Farm.  I know, I think I'm out of hornin'  If you pull my hands, you take a break. 
[00:42:30]  I got a heap full of ideas.  I can't see it.  It's a shame to be suverted.  It's good.  I ain't got no way to do it.  I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more  Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more  Might as well be mad though  I don't mind it 
[00:43:00]  What?  It's not good  It's Dylan  Bob Dylan's throat polyps  We're selling Bob Dylan's throat polyps  Get him now  Jim Min 10 condition  And we got plenty of them  He sounds horrible 
[00:43:30]  He's royalty I don't mind him  Royalty?  Should have Jacob Dylan out there  Fuck Jacob Dylan  Oh god  That hack  Please  Stupid hack Jacob Dylan  Jess in all honesty prefers Jacob Dylan to Bob Dylan  She felt very like I'm right at the Grammys  What?  Yes  Jacob Dylan  You can't even do anything with that  Well I mean  It's not even a comparison  Ain't gonna eat the potted meat no more  Ain't gonna eat that potted meat 
[00:44:00]  That's a character from Sling Blade  Yes he did kind of sound  Did you like the Gwyneth Paltrow?  No!  With CeeLo?  I kind of liked it  CeeLo Paltrow?  It was CeeLo Paltrow  I kind of liked it  I don't know  I kind of liked it  It was like  It was fun to watch like bad karaoke  Yeah it was really bad karaoke  111 million people were watching bad karaoke with Gwyneth Paltrow  And what the fuck was CBS dumping out of the entire night? 
[00:44:30]  Like was everyone cursing?

[00:49:30]  And then from that day forward  They've been joined at the hip  Like Emanuel Lewis  And Michael Jackson  Oh yeah  Well you want to put it  In those terms  It sure looked like it  When Bieber is sitting  On the stage  With his dumb guitar  And his dumb headset mic  And then dumb Usher  Comes out with his dumb  Headset mic  Stupid people  And they start  And they start like  Interacting  It's like  I remember that  You mean ad-libbing?  Yeah  Yeah ad-libbing  I remember that  Do you remember  Trying to go for a moment  And it was such a creepy moment 
[00:50:00]  But then Usher had to go  Remember  What was the line?  Fuck  It was almost like  It's a your time  It's your  Yeah but he said  If  Oh fuck  If you were  If you were  What was the line?  I don't remember  It was so forced  And then he goes  Well here's your time  It's your time now  He pats him on the back  Almost like he's passing the torch  Right  Oh I wish it was a literal torch  And he threw it in his hair  And then  She burned off Justin Bieber's hairdo  Yeah  And then Bieber wins nothing  His performance  I don't really  It was great  Bieber won nothing  And his movie came in second 
[00:50:30]  And his performance was weak  Dude  He's not that  He's not as good  As his hype  No  He's good  He's making a lot of money  For a lot of fucking people  And these dumb teeny boppers  Love him  But he's not as good  As his hype  You could pull our Bieber conversation  From months ago  When I said  I looked in on this Bieber performance  And he cannot dance  He's not a good singer  He's a teen idol  Based on his looks 
[00:51:00]  Period  And what's great  Will Smith  I wish I had a dad  Like Will Smith  Like you know  That was his kids  Birthday present  I got to sing  With Bieber on the Grammys  There was no reason for that  Yeah  Technically  But Will Smith  Is so powerful  And has so much money  He told Bieber  Look  My son's birthday  Was it his son  Or his fucking daughter  Because they look alike now  It was Jaden his son  But that song  Was first from  The Karate Kid movie  Yeah  So they were like  Ah let's put him in  So you gotta do that  For the performance 
[00:51:30]  Trust me  That goes back  To some kind of  Weird birthday gift  That Will Smith gave his kid  Will Smith's yelling  That's my baby  That's my baby  Right  Got another generation  Of fucking  Overconfident Smiths  Of fucking  Great  Fresh Prince of Bel-Air  Great  And let's all remember  Where he came from  Fucking  Parents just don't understand  DJ Jazzy Jeff  Yes  What happened to DJ Jazzy Jeff  He didn't have  Confident kids  I guess  Why wasn't he sitting  With the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air  Will Smith  I don't know 
[00:52:00]  So the Bieber  You know  And then  Put him in Independence Day  Who won Best New Artist  Over the Bieber  She's getting death threats  Yeah what's her name  Spaulding  Spaulding  Yeah  How did Spaulding win  But the Bieber fans  Not happy about that  No yeah yeah yeah  They're not  I mean  You can't do anything  Around Bieber  I'll give you  Best New Artist of the Year  Yeah the Bieber  Wow  Yeah  Didn't make out well 
[00:52:30]  No  Dissed  You think this is going to  Hurt his cred  With his tweens  No I think the tweens  Will still be into him  But I'll tell you  That Selena Gomez  Better watch out  Because the fans  Don't like that  He has a girlfriend  You know what  Boy everybody  Was alluding  To the fact that  Those two are an item  And making jokes about it  Donnie Wahlberg  Really made a little thing  Donnie Don  Donnie Don  Fucking made a comment  He's fearless  Looked over at her  And was like  Justin Bieber  You know  The guy that's  Slipping you  The cock  Is that what he said 
[00:53:00]  Yeah yeah  It's incredible  You didn't hear that part  No I was flipping  I heard it at my house  Wow  You know what though  I might have said it though  That's why I heard it  Justin Bieber can't handle  A woman like Selena Gomez  Are you fucking kidding me  You look at Selena Gomez  And go  You're like  That girl  She's a little girl still  But she needs like  She needs a real man  Not a Justin Bieber  She's a  Justin Bieber  Should be going out  With girls  That still have braces  And stuff  Yeah  That's more his  Fucking level  Bieber's still on the  Assembly line 
[00:53:30]  And she's ready  To be driven off  The showroom floor  Yeah  That is fucking  She is so ready  He can't handle that  No  He can't handle that  Isn't that awful  You think he fucking  Knows what he's doing  If he goes down  To lick that  No he's never  He's scared of it still  She looks down  At that Bieber hairdo  Between her legs  And just goes  What is he even  Trying to do  She's like  I need a real man  What is he trying  To do here  Look at her  Seriously  He's darting his tongue  In and out of a vagina  Thinking she likes it  Yeah  He's just stabbing 
[00:54:00]  Her vagina with his tongue  She's like  Clit  Clit  You dummy  He's like  I don't know  Usher  Could you help me here  And then  It's Bieber  Eating pussy  Featuring Usher  Yeah  And Usher  Usher's gotta come over  And start licking her box  Usher goes everywhere  With them  Yo  Justin  Why don't you just  Step off  And let me and Selena  Go with this  Alright Usher  Do it like this  And then Usher  Just starts  The clit  And she's fucking  Cumming  Justin Bieber sits there  Insecurely  As Selena Gomez 
[00:54:30]  Says  Don't worry Justin  Don't worry  Let him  It's fine  Cuckled Beaver  Bieber  Well whatever  Bieber and the Beaver  What a mismatch  Yeah of course  That should not be happening  Whatsoever  Selena Gomez  I don't think she wants  To be going out  With Rachel Maddow  Put the Rachel Maddow  And the Beaver  I'm telling you  I'm onto something  Is it the same hairdo  I have no idea  Same hairdo  It's the same person  Justin Bieber  Looks like Rachel Maddow 
[00:55:00]  I'm obsessed with this  Maybe once his  Features start sharpening  When he gets older  Because he's still got  Baby face  Yeah  Because she's got  Some sharp manly features  She really looks manly  Wow  Someone already did it  Look  I'm telling you  There's a similarity there  Justin Bieber  And Rachel Maddow  Yeah once his face  Starts elongating  Like Rick Schroeder's did  We all remember  Ricky Schroeder  Ricky Schroeder  Had the little round face  Don't die champ  Don't die  We all remember  Silver spoons 
[00:55:30]  And then  By NYPD Blue  He had like a rock jaw  You know  It was just like  That'll happen to the Beeb  When he starts shaving  Good old Beeb  What else  Oh it was Esperanza Spalder  Esperanza  What song did she sing?  She's like a jazz musician  Oh boy  It was a big upset  That she won  I think the Academy  Was going for a little  Something different this year  Oh boy  They wanted to remain  Unpredictable  And Miley Cyrus  Looking good for 30  Yes  Miley Cyrus 
[00:56:00]  Looking really hot  For 30 years old  She's gotten a little heavier  A little heavier  She's a fucking pig  She's horrible looking  What happened to her  We don't like her anymore  Dude  Did you see her on the Grammys  She really looks like  She's 30 years old  All of her youth  Has disappeared  How old is she for real?  She's probably  17, 18  18 or 19 I think  She looks easily  10 years older  Easily  I think she wants that  Well I don't know man  Then she had side boob going  Which usually is really sexy  But it wasn't 
[00:56:30]  What?  It was kind of like  It was kind of like  Fatty looking  What's going on?  Wow her face is rounding out  Isn't it?  Yeah  What's with these dumb broads  Getting fat?  What the fuck are you doing?  If you didn't know any better  Would you say she's about 30?  I'm not even joking  She does not look 18 years old anymore  I'd put her in late 20s  Late 20s?  I might not put her over the 30 mark  Alright so  Late 20s would be 10 years older  But now she's  You know  Yeah  She's getting a lot older  She's looking at 
[00:57:00]  Janelle Monae  Huh?  Yeah  She's like Janelle Monae  She was the  Black girl  In the like  Tux with the poof  On her head  Boo  You know  What the fuck  Was that look?  The cotton candy look  Yeah that's her thing  That's her thing huh?  Janelle Monae  How about you just have a voice  Being your thing?  Well she's got a whole image  And a voice  And who had the skunky hairdo?  The white hair  Oh that's the  Oh that's the one I thought  The cotton candy hair?  Yeah that one 
[00:57:30]  Is that a different person?  Yeah Janelle Monae  Is the black girl  With the afro poof  On the top of her head  Oh I'm sorry  Yeah  I got confused  Yeah with that round fucking  Yeah  She had like a mini afro  Right  In the front of her head  Oh okay  I thought you meant  Cotton candy woman  With the fucking  Freakish white-ish  Fucking cotton candy  Oh is that the side boob?  Yeah  Oh Nicki Minaj?  Yeah yeah yeah  That's the side boob right there  Yeah look it's like  Usually that's kind of odd  It's like just fatty looking  What's with the fucking dress?  Like  Yeah that kind of 
[00:58:00]  She was going for something  Oh what's going on?  There's a weird wrinkle  Under her armpit  Which uh  Because her arm is back  Yeah  I don't know  That could just be the photo  I never got the Miley Cyrus  As far as looking hot  What the hell?  She looks alright there  What am I talking about?  Yeah see that's  Yeah what the fuck  Alright she's really hot still  Just fuck it  And nah  Who knows  I'd tap out on that one  She's alright  Who knows  She's alright  Great  That's it  I think  Yeah I think she's looking just fine  Did we cover our  Did we cover our Grammys? 
[00:58:30]  Let me think  The Bob Dylan  The Mick Jagger  You didn't like the Muse  You didn't like  The Arcade Fire  The basic thing overall  Was you know  The Lady Gaga  Was she wearing underpants?  If she wasn't  Also known as Little Panties  Madonna's underpants  Did you see that  It looked like it was a see-through thing  And everyone's like  Trying to figure out  You know  If she was wearing anything  Under that tight fucking dress  How about the  The fucking shoulder horns?  I like those  The implants  No  What the fuck was that?  What do you mean shoulder horns? 
[00:59:00]  She had them on her forehead  Yeah  And in her shoulders  Makeup  Yeah  Coming out  Yeah  Great  Yeah her shoulder horns  Wow she's wild  And wacky  Performance artist  She really is  Doing Madonna's song  Express Yourself to a T  Yeah it's  It's in the same key  It was the same voice  She was imitating Madonna's voice  And the changes  And the structure of the song  Was the same  It was amazingly the same  The second it came on 
[00:59:30]  I knew exactly what song  It was completely ripping off  Here here listen  A mashup of  Born This Way  Express Yourself quick  It doesn't matter  If you love him  Or the capital  Try and  And  And  Just put your power  You love Born This Way  Baby  I've got nothing to say  I've got nothing to say  It's a-  Cause what was it  You're dancing  Baby 
[01:00:00]  Put your love  To the test  You know you know you've got to  Now I know it's coming  When I lose them  And baby  Let you love your love  Is me  Just put my soul  I'm dancing  Baby  To the test  To the test  I know you've got to  Think what was it  I feel you are just there  Cause you made the world be real  So hold on tight  I'm loving you so far 
[01:00:30]  Dance in the middle, babe  I'm on the right, babe  I'm on the right, babe  I'm on the right, babe  Don't hurt yourself in the grave  Love yourself in the dead  I'm on the right, babe  I'm on the right, babe  Don't hurt yourself in the way  Maintenant I'm on the right, babe  I'm on the right 
[01:01:00]  It's the exact same song  The words are just different  You can lay them right on top of each other  That's what they did there  That ain't a mash-up.  That's laying the exact songs on top of each other and saying,  Holy shit.  Look at that.  There may be a certain degree of parallel thinking, but that's all I'll give.  Parallel thinking.  Shut the fuck up.  I won't give it any more than that.  Kevin from Connecticut writes, Lady Gadana. 
[01:01:30]  Yes.  Lady Gadana.  I mean, you know.  Wow, that was really...  There are some lines in that Gaga song where you're just like,  that is exactly taken from Express Yourself.  And you're being a drag.  Don't be a drag.  Just be a queen.  Right, right.  I know.  We were born this way.  It's in our DNA.  Exactly.  Yes, I know the song.  I actually...  It's a great song.  It was...  I had fucking... 
[01:02:00]  92.3 was on my radio this morning when I was pulling out of my garage  because somebody was using my vehicle.  Could you leave the fuck...  Could you put back on 1010 Winds before you fucking shut the car off?  Listening to your own station?  Yeah.  As I'm backing out of the garage, that song comes on.  Gaga's song.  So I'm like, I'll give it a listen.  Good for you.  And I would...  There's no one in the truck with me yet.  I'm talking to myself.  It's going, what a fucking ripoff.  What a ripoff this is.  Jesus. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, it really is.  Yeah.  Well, you know.  History repeats itself.  That's one of those.  But I don't...  What I don't understand about the Lady Gaga is the fact that she is talented and she has  a very good voice.  So she doesn't have to fucking show up to the Grammys in an egg and she doesn't have  to do all this fucking over-the-top weird shit.  A little weird would be fine.  I get it.  Now it's just coming off as weird.  And now she's got to top herself and people are forgetting that she's even talented because  they're like, oh wow, is she going to wear a building on her head to this award show?  She explained to Mr. Anderson Cooper... 
[01:03:00]  Mr. Anderson.  The reason that she does things like that is so people focus on her as a performer and  not elements of her personality that have nothing to do with her music.  But there's people going...  They're not focusing on her voice.  They're like, why is she wearing horns?  Why is she coming out of an egg?  Why does she have a meat dress on?  But those singles keep going to number one, baby.  Yeah, they certainly do.  I understand.  It is true.  I mean, she's obviously making a shitload of money, so what do we know?  $100 million last year.  Like Jennifer Hudson, you'll never see her in a meat dress. 
[01:03:30]  You won't see her hit number one either.  Boom.  She's fucking had number ones, hasn't she?  For how fat she was and how much weight she lost.  When she takes her clothes off, she's in a meat dress.  You think?  You know what that skin must look like?  Yuck.  Yeah, you're probably right.  Yeah.  All right, I don't want to have sex with Jennifer Hudson anymore.  No, I didn't think you did.  You just fucked it up.  You want to have sex with somebody that looks like Jennifer Hudson that was never bad.  You're probably right.  Yeah.  And black girls, man, they got the stretch marks. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, man.  Black girls can't hide stretch marks.  No, no.  But Patrice loves that shit, he told us.  A lot of the brothers like the stretch marks.  They're like, oh, that's sexy.  Well, if it's good enough for David A-List Otonga, I don't know why it's not good enough  for you guys.  Not for the A-List or Jesus Christ, enough.  All right.  We should probably take a break.  Yeah, I got soup.  Hey, what happened with Mark Anthony and Jennifer Lopez?  It was just uncomfortable.  It looks like they don't like each other or something.  Yeah, they just were on stage performing together.  I mean, not performing, presenting together.  You think Mark Anthony's feeling the pressure of like, he needs a hit to stay married to 
[01:04:30]  Jennifer Lopez?  Well, first of all...  She's not going to fucking stay married to a guy that doesn't have hits.  At the pre-show, he seemed all like, let's just say, bugged out.  Very, you know, his lips were moving and his eyebrows kept moving and stuff.  Yeah, Mark Anthony's starting to lose a little bit.  His jaw was moving around.  Because people aren't talking about Mark Anthony as much.  And now his wife is on American Idol and still fucking doing...  He's just inserting himself into her projects.  Yeah, and he's getting very nervous.  Like, oh, fuck, man.  I haven't had a hit in a while. 
[01:05:00]  And then they were joking around with each other when they were presenting, but it all seemed  like they were going to fight with each other afterwards.  It was just uncomfortable.  No chemistry.  My tweet on Mark Anthony was that he looked like a dying chihuahua.  That's what he looked like.  Yeah.  That's his luck.  He just looks like he's a dying dog.  He's got the J-Lo.  No, that's what the point we're making.  He doesn't have her for much longer.  He better get a hit.  But he's had it for a while.  He needs a hit, right?  He's got some kind of weird control over her.  When was the last time he had a hit?  When was the last time we were talking about Mark Anthony as a solo artist and not, 
[01:05:30]  oh, Mark Anthony married to Jennifer Lopez?  Probably 1999.  No.  It's been 10 years?  It's been a long time since Mark Anthony had a hit.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, J-Lo's going to move on then.  Oh, and Puff Daddy.  Oh, did he with his leather tux jacket on?  Fuck that.  How great was it that he couldn't read?  He can't read.  He's gone slowly.  And he's got his braces on.  You didn't get that for us?  Could you get Puff Daddy?  Because this is the stuff.  We need to cover the Grammy stuff that no one else is talking about. 
[01:06:00]  And the fact is, Puff Daddy can't read.  And we've got to show everybody.  Can you get that clip after the break?  Yes.  He had his grill in?  Or was that braces?  No, his bottom grill was in.  Why is he wearing a grill?  Jewelry?  Successorized?  Jury?  Yes, jewelry.  He's wearing some jewelry?  10 years from now, the Puff Daddies and the rest of them are going to look at Lil Wayne,  I think.  They're going to look at that grill shit going, what the fuck were we thinking?  Yeah, but Lil Wayne's also going to have tattoos all over his face still.  He's not going to be worried about his grill. 
[01:06:30]  True.  True.  But the Puff Daddy can't read.  His eyebrows still say, I am music, tattooed on forever.  Really?  Yeah.  That's Wayne.  Good for him.  All right, we should break.  All righty.  And when we come back, we will certainly discuss this.  First time, Serene.  Well, a very, very heavy invitation tonight.  We had a very Darison fight.  Let's go ahead and tear his taste and let's have the pet. 
[01:07:00]  The virus.  Sirius XM.  Follow the O.P. and Anthony Show on Facebook.  Facebook.com slash O.P. and Anthony.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  If I was scared, I would.  And if I was bored, you know I would.  And if I was bored, you know I would.  And I'm not. 
[01:07:30]  Not a fan of that air.  I'm not saying I'm not a fan or I am a fan.  Oh, it was a question.  But I am saying, like, I've heard this before.  All right?  This is fucking 80s.  This is Depeche Mode or some shit.  Isn't it?  I don't know what it is.  It's just.  No, I'm not a fan.  I'll just say I'm not a fan.  No.  Arcade Fire.  Not a fan.  From the suburbs.  What song, though? 
[01:08:00]  It's ready to start.  Thank you.  No, it's playing already.  It gets worse than that as far as the 80s sound goes.  I don't think.  I don't hear as much 80s sound in that one as other bands are out.  It's vocals at the beginning of that and shit.  Oh, it's certainly there a little bit.  I think it's complete 80s.  New Wave Pop.  Really quick, here's the Diddy.  Is it Puff Daddy?  Is it the Diddy? 
[01:08:30]  Is it the Did?  These days he's saying just call him whatever.  Oh, really?  He doesn't care as much as he used to.  Oh, that's good.  Well, the fact is he can't read.  She's one of the most consistent artists in music.  And he's one of the most talented rappers in the game.  Performing their smash hit.  And also a Grammy winner tonight.  Performing live.  What's my name? 
[01:09:00]  Rihanna and Drake.  Yeah.  See, he's reading that in sections.  You know what I mean?  Blah, blah, blah.  Yeah.  In sections.  Yeah.  Wow.  That was rough to watch.  Well, we're going to be joking about this all day, but let's take our first shots now.  Now, this fucking L.A. reporter.  Yeah.  The thing is, what confuses me, it was hilarious when we all discovered, holy shit, did you hear this lady after the Grammys trying to do her report. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  It was a mess.  And then everyone's laughing because who cares?  You don't know her.  And then you get the do-gooders out there that go, you know, she had a stroke.  It's not funny.  So then you're not supposed to laugh.  And then it comes out that she probably didn't have a stroke.  Then you're allowed to laugh again.  Now you can laugh.  That doesn't make any sense.  Oh.  This could be the funniest thing to ever happen on TV.  It makes perfect sense.  Why does it make sense?  I don't know.  It doesn't make any sense.  You know, I feel bad for her and her family, I guess. 
[01:10:00]  But I don't know them.  To me, it's just entertainment.  When I turn on the TV, all I'm looking for is entertainment.  Here's the report I got.  She did this.  She fucked up for reasons unknown.  The paramedics came over and checked her out and took her vitals.  Everything was cool.  And she didn't even go to the hospital.  I hear she just, a friend drove her home.  She woke up the next morning and said, yeah, I feel fine.  Fine. 
[01:10:30]  So what was it about?  She was speaking some kind of, either some kind of archaic language that decided to come  out of her, or she invented her own language, or she's an alien.  It was like an alien took over her body.  I don't think she got one word right, right?  Maybe one or two?  She invented some real cool new ones, though, that I want to use.  Well, a very, very heavy bertation tonight.  Heavy bertation.  Hold on.  That's a heavy bertation isn't, it doesn't mean anything, but it should. 
[01:11:00]  It should is right.  Don't you think a heavy bertation, like, dude.  Yeah, but.  I had such a heavy bertation last night.  I was on the bowl all fucking night.  But that word, dersion, or dirt.  Bertation.  The one before is pretty good, too.  I mean, after it.  Hold on.  Let's pick up all the-  Heavy bertation.  Heavy bertation. 
[01:11:30]  First time to read.  Well, a very, very heavy.  And is that berry berry?  Berry berry.  No, it was a VB combo.  The very, I can't even say it.  The very, very, new term, heavy bertation.  Oh, they actually have it listed as a new term there, Danny?  Right on.  Yeah, apparently.  Heavy bertation.  Well, not really.  I think they're just linking to the video itself.  But we need to define what a bertation is.  A bertation.  Yeah, well, we should all come.  Is that like when you have a brain fart so bad, you just start saying gibberish? 
[01:12:00]  I had a bertation.  I had a bertation.  We could do better than that.  We have to come up with a definition.  Marty, it's caused by the heavy bertation.  The bertation.  No, the earth.  Whatever.  The bertation of the earth's gravitational pull.  Heavy bertation.  Well, a very, very heavy bertation tonight.  We had a very Darrison fight.  Let's go ahead.  I'm a fan of Darrison. 
[01:12:30]  I'm a fan of Darrison.  A Darrison.  We had a Darrison.  And a bertation.  A bertation and a Darrison.  Yeah.  Hold on.  I thought there was more to this.  Too bad they didn't.  Did they go back to her?  No.  Dude, see, that's why I've got to be a news director.  You get her back on camera immediately.  Yeah.  Why not?  We have a very bertation tonight.  We had a very...  Burtation tonight.  We had a very Darrison fight. 
[01:13:00]  Let's go ahead.  Terrence, Chase, and let's go ahead.  And have the pet.  Holy S.  Let me see that.  Holy S.  Okay, go to the beginning of the...  We had a very Darrison fight.  Let's go ahead.  Terrence, Chase, and let's go ahead.  They had the pet.  Right.  And here's the subtitles.  Well, a very, very heavy...  Well, a very, very heavy...  A heavy Darrison tonight.  We had a very Darrison...  We had a very Darrison. 
[01:13:30]  Darrison.  Darrison.  Okay.  We had Darrison fight.  Let's go ahead.  Terrence, Chase, and let's go ahead.  Terrence, take.  English, fourth bite, who have the pet.  The pet.  Wait, go back.  What's that?  Very, very heavy...  A heavy Darrison tonight.  We had a very Darrison fight.  Let's go ahead.  Terrence, Chase, and let's go ahead.  Let's go ahead.  They had the pet.  Oh, my God.  Darrison, Darrison, with you.  Darrison, Darrison.  Every week, day, afternoon, three.  Darrison, Darrison. 
[01:14:00]  English, for the bite, who have the pet.  Who have the pet.  Who have the pet.  Yeah.  I was telling Anthony that I could be having a stroke right now, and I wouldn't know it.  That's what creeps me out about this clip, because you look at her, and she thinks she's  speaking Shakespeare or something.  Yeah.  She thinks she is fucking on and letting the whole world know what is going on at the  Grammys, and the fact is, holy shit.  She's clueless in the fact that she said all that. 
[01:14:30]  Hey, if you want to win a bertation, make sure you listen to Darrison in the morning, and  get the secret word.  You know what I'm saying, though?  There's a little kid in the background fucking going crazy.  Exactly.  Yeah, that was a good mashup you did. 
[01:15:00]  CBS 2, Serene Brad.  You know what I'm saying, though?  That's what's creepy.  Yeah, yeah.  I guess this happens to people, and you have no idea.  You think you're speaking properly?  Yeah, she probably thought, like, hey, what's wrong with people?  Yeah, why is everyone in shock?  Why are they giving me those eyes?  I just did a perfect fucking intro to my Grammy piece.  Like, right now, you could just be talking and thinking you're hearing everything fine,  and people are looking at you like, what the fuck are you saying?  Do you at least recognize that people are looking at you weird, because you're not speaking 
[01:15:30]  properly?  Oh, my God.  What?  I know.  Yeah, that would be freaky.  That's what's creepy.  Freaky.  Because she had the confidence still.  Until the end, she lost it slightly at the end.  Oh, my God.  She started looking like, what the hell is going on?  A little bit, but in general, she kept it together.  Yeah.  I don't know what's up.  But could someone explain to me why funny, at first, because you're thinking she just was  a mush mouth, like a Voss situation, or maybe she had a little wine waiting for the 
[01:16:00]  Grammy stand, or maybe she popped a pill for something else that's going to be  going on in her life, whatever.  An Ambien.  So you're thinking, oh, that's hilarious that she went on live TV in that state.  Yeah.  So then everyone in the country is laughing.  Just about every person I saw is like, holy shit, that's hilarious.  And then you find out she might have had a stroke, and then there's a percentage of  the country that backs off and says, that's fucking not funny.  She had a stroke.  They went crazy.  But then those same people are now laughing again, knowing that she didn't have a stroke.  That doesn't make sense to me. 
[01:16:30]  I think when people say it's a medical thing, because then you look at it and go, you have  that whole there, but for the grace of God, go I thought, where it's like, oh boy, oh boy,  you don't want that happening.  Look, if it happens to someone close to you, of course it's tragic.  But we don't know her.  That's what people are doing, though.  They're like, oh, I know people, or a lot of doctors are chiming in and going, this isn't  funny, this is a medical problem.  Ah, fluid buildup.  Oh, yeah, maybe we get Dr. Steve. 
[01:17:00]  Does he have any clue on what the hell this was?  What's a bertation?  Bertation.  When fluid builds up in the bertaceous gland, you'll get bertation.  Thank you, Troy.  Bertation.  Someone's saying I had a mini-stroke when I was trying to say Arcade Fire.  Fair enough, sir, fair enough.  I did say Arcadia.  That's a fucked up clip, though.  Just watching her, it's like nothing I've ever seen. 
[01:17:30]  No.  Like, I've never seen someone just start talking and have no idea what is coming out of their  mouth.  We haven't had a clip like this in years.  You can't even figure out what she was trying to say.  I know.  Oh, bertation is something Bill Burr said.  All right.  It's a quote.  A quotation from Bill Burr is a bertation.  That's a new word.  His new comedy special should be called Bertations.  That's great.  Are we doing Sniglets?  What year is this?  I hated Sniglets.  Oh, God.  I was not a fan of the Sniglets. 
[01:18:00]  Enough.  Not necessarily the news?  Was that what that was on?  I wasn't a fan of it.  What was that?  Rich Hall, was it?  I think so.  Am I pulling that out of my ass?  I think so.  Wow.  I don't know if that was it.  Was it?  Yeah, it was Rich Hall.  Wow.  Okay.  That was 1984, I think, around there.  Holy shit.  That was a long time to fucking go.  You should play Anthony's YouTube video.  It was very good, man.  Your little mashup you did with that broad.  Oh, yeah.  That's good.  If anybody wants to see it, just go to O-P-A-N-T-X-M on YouTube. 
[01:18:30]  I know.  O-P-A-N-T-X-M.  O-P-A-N-T-X-M on YouTube.  Speaking of videos, it's not one of mine.  Don't worry.  A guy was inspired by the Stacey Keech intro and put together a seven-minute video montage  of this fucking show.  That's crazy.  He's been tweaking it, so I haven't tweeted it yet, but I think it's finally done and I'm 
[01:19:00]  going to tweet it today.  It's so fucking good, but it also depresses the shit out of you because you realize all  the stuff we got to do just on satellite only a couple of years ago.  Yeah.  You got the Nazi thing, you and Patrice trying to get the cab.  Oh, I know.  Is that fun?  Nigga versus Nazi and the cake stomp and Pat from Menachee's fucking eggnog challenge. 
[01:19:30]  And just one after another, and most of them are from the satellite years.  Yep.  Yeah.  So I'll tweet it later.  It's really, really well done.  It has our old XM commercial with the fat brood.  Oh, really?  Yeah, where we belong on the radio.  Yeah.  Although that wasn't an XM commercial.  That was for K-Rock, I think.  Oh, that was.  But still, and good job by this guy, man.  Wait till you see it later.  Check that shit out.  I think there's like 200 edits in it or something.  It's like... 
[01:20:00]  Yeah, real fast?  With Stacey Keech, you know, in there.  Explaining the show.  Stacey Keech.  Really good job, man.  With that voice.  I'll pass that on to everyone later.  Do you got Anthony's video?  Because it plays...  Oh, that's...  Yeah, that's the...  The audio plays perfectly.  Because it actually fits.  Yeah.  I want to hear this again.  First time, Sarine.  Well, a very, very heavy...  Heavy flirtation tonight.  We had a very...  Well, that's not it.  But let's go ahead.  Tara's chasing. 
[01:20:30]  Let's have the pick.  Have the pick?  I don't know.  Like, now I want to know what she was trying to say.  There's no figuring out.  Obviously, she was going to somebody else that was on the...  At the Grammys with their picks.  But that's not...  I can't for the life of me figure out what the fuck she's talking about.  Really fast.  Matt in Virginia.  Matt.  First call of the week.  What do you got, brother?  It sounds like she has a symptom of migraine headaches called alphagia that either affects 
[01:21:00]  the speech center of the brain or the vision, which is definitely the speech on this one.  I get it all the time when I get migraine headaches, like really bad ones.  You can't talk?  And it literally makes you not be able to talk properly?  Your thought process is working, but it's not translating into words properly, and it's  just gibberish that comes out of your mouth.  That's fucked up.  Yeah, yeah.  She probably had a really bad migraine headache and knew that this could be a possibility. 
[01:21:30]  Damn, that's fucked up.  Oh, wow.  Thank you, sir.  Yep.  We're going to try to get Dr. Steve on the phone to see if there's anything to that.  Bob in Rhode Island.  Later or whatever.  What's going on?  Hey, Bob.  What do you got?  Get here, babe.  I was just wondering if maybe she's like an old-time record.  You play her backwards and she makes sense.  All right.  We have to do that immediately.  Sam.  Oh, my God.  But play it backwards.  Is there any way to play it backwards from where you're at?  I don't know.  Play it backwards.  Can you imagine?  Of course not.  It's like a Paul is dead situation.  Yeah.  Maybe she was saying some secret message. 
[01:22:00]  Some secret messages going on.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Great idea, man.  We got to try that.  Is there a possibility, is all I'm saying, that it would make more sense backwards?  I don't know.  Now I'm wondering.  What's bertation backwards?  Because the regular way, there's, I think, only two words that you recognize.  Yeah.  Berry or barry.  And we're not even sure.  Maybe they just threw it in there.  She just threw it in.  Who knows? 
[01:22:30]  Right, right, right, right, right.  Who knows she meant to say those words?  Wow.  We're trying to figure out how to play that backwards.  Backwards.  Do we have Anthony's thing, too, or is there too much going on there now?  This is what Anthony did with the...  And it's a video, so you can check it out.  Yeah, you saw the video a million times.  It plays well for the radio audience, too.  Good evening, everyone.  I'm Pat Harvey.  And I'm Paul Majors.  Country trio Lady Antebellum was the big winner tonight with five Grammy Awards.  Rapper Eminem, The Big Shocker, winning only two despite ten nominations. 
[01:23:00]  CBS 2's Serene Branson is live at the Staples Center with highlights and backstage coverage.  We're seen for the very first time.  Serene.  I bet I fist.  I bet I feel a lot burned.  Got our skunk padded little kid in the background fucking going crazy.  It might as well have been that.  Of course.  It might as well have fucking been that.  Of course.  Cigars and Scotch knows something about this. 
[01:23:30]  What?  Cigars.  What do you got on this, man?  I do CAT scans for a living.  I've seen this a lot of...  Meow.  And sometimes it's not always just gibberish.  Sometimes they'll say actual words and it's just garbled.  It'll be like random words out of a sentence.  Like you're playing...  You're like one of those, like, you know, fill in the word thing and just garbled it all.  All right.  What disease is it?  And what are the odds of me getting it?  Oh, my God.  Really?  No.  It's not common at all, but it happens enough that I've seen it.  And the people are completely lucid, so they know what they're trying to say and the wrong 
[01:24:00]  stuff's coming out.  And it panics the shit out of them.  Well, that's fucked up.  Yeah.  Damn.  A lot of times it's with like a transient ischemic attack where it's like a temporary  little mini stroke or it's definitely a neurological attack when it happens.  Look, man, you got NSR Garrett on the old Twitter there.  I saw my grandfather have a stroke and he talked like that for a minute.  I definitely laughed just in a different room.  I'm sorry.  You laugh. 
[01:24:30]  You laugh and then hope it doesn't happen to you.  That's exactly what should happen.  Exactly.  How do you hold back a laugh because you're thinking, oh, God, this might happen to me?  You stuttering, muttering prick.  Yeah.  Later.  They're calling you cigars and scans now.  Steven S. from Bayshore.  Oh.  Cigars and scans.  I didn't know he did that for a living, man.  Well, he's got to make money somehow.  I don't know how you work in the medical community.  God bless you guys that do because you see all the stuff that could happen to you. 
[01:25:00]  Fuck that.  Yeah.  Fuck that shit.  Right?  Fuck that noise.  All you have to do is walk around a hospital for an hour and go, holy shit, there's a lot of shit that could happen to me.  Oh, there's all kinds of crap out there.  Ah.  How do you go to work like that?  Scary.  And I'm with you at the medical shows because of that reason.  Don't watch them.  Because all you do is learn about weird shit that could happen to you.  Don't need it.  Don't watch any of those medical shows.  You got it backwards.  No, I can't get it.  I can't get it done.  Derek's doing it right now.  So we'll have it in a few minutes. 
[01:25:30]  Derek is the man.  He is the man.  He'll do it.  Oh, a couple other things.  We were so wrong on the Egypt thing.  Oh, God.  Was that embarrassing?  We brag that we really see things way before mainstream media, and for the most part, our fucking batting average is pretty damn good, but we blew it with Egypt.  That was a swing and a miss on that one.  That replay, I wanted to call someone and go, yank this.  Yeah, I can't listen.  I was listening.  We're talking about, we're talking, saying there's not a chance he leaves.  He's just going to wait it out. 
[01:26:00]  It's going to end in violence and bloodshed.  They're going to drag him out of there.  By his balls.  Military's going to unload on the people.  It's going to.  And meanwhile, everyone knew what had happened at that point, because the replay, I mean, it changed in a matter of minutes.  And that's why we got guys that, here we go again, but I'll take my shot every fucking day until they drag me out of here.  That's why we have the wrong guys fucking in charge of this channel.  Yeah.  They're not smart enough to realize that we did an hour and a half on Egypt saying this guy's not going anywhere. 
[01:26:30]  All hell breaks loose.  The whole world changed, and they're satisfied with the replay where we're completely wrong.  Yeah.  And there was no comedic value to it.  It was just our opinion on something that already happened, and we were completely wrong.  Yeah, it wasn't a bit or anything.  See, someone with a radio brain would have said, you know what, it'd probably be in our best interest just not to play that on the replay.  Yeah.  But those guys don't even have that thought.  It really was a little silly to listen to.  I was cringing.  Yeah, if we had jokes and shit going on in there, then of course you'd keep it in.  But it was like serious commentary. 
[01:27:00]  Serious commentary about something we were completely wrong about.  That was terrible.  Oh, man.  Look at D-Boy.  D to the boy.  D-Boy's right on the...  Thank you, sir.  Johnny on the spot, they call him.  Thank you.  D-Boy on the spot.  So you got Mubarak.  He leaves.  Yeah.  And now you got all those people in Egypt.  I feel bad for him.  Yeah.  Especially since that fucking nuke went off right in the middle of Cairo.  Oh, boy, did it.  Oh, my God.  I'm just hoping maybe that happens and now we don't sound silly on the replay. 
[01:27:30]  You heard it too, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, my God.  I turned it on for a few minutes.  I'm like, this is just embarrassing for us.  It was embarrassing.  I'm just going, oh, oh, no.  But we have no one that realizes that.  Oh, I didn't want to, ooh.  And I don't mean you guys, by the way, Dan.  Because that shouldn't be your responsibility either.  It should be those guys down the hall to go, you know what?  This doesn't make sense anymore.  I guess it's one of those things where it was just like, ah, who gives a shit?  Let's listen to them sound like idiots.  Yeah, but that's dumb.  I mean, if you got replays, you could adjust shit. 
[01:28:00]  That's the beauty of having replays.  Yeah.  You have a bunch of hours and you go, you know what?  Wow, you guys were wrong about this this morning.  Why don't we just cut it out of the replay and play some dumb old bit?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mubarak leaves.  I feel bad for the people because I think it's the same situation with the Obama where  you have a society or a certain part of society that thinks major change now happens.  Yeah, yeah.  It doesn't work.  It's not going to happen.  No.  Their lives are going to get just a little better. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  That's the reality of that.  Do you know?  Like those people that thought they were getting new cars and stuff because Obama got elected.  Yeah.  You just don't get that type of change right away.  Did you hear what minimum wage is over there?  Well, I know the average household makes $2,000 a year.  It was $6.50 a month.  A month?  And it's been $6.50 a month for 20 years.  Can I ask you something about that?  Fantastic.  This is what confuses me because I don't really – I'm not all in with politics. 
[01:29:00]  Like why did we support Mubarak for 30-some-odd years knowing that their people were making  $2,000 a year?  The average person was making $2,000 a year.  We don't look like good guys that we support a regime like that.  Same thing why we support the Saudis and shit.  It's in our best interest.  So it's in our best interest.  It's oil.  And with Egypt, it was keeping the peace with Israel.  Right.  That was a biggie.  No, I get that part of it.  The Suez Canal.  But we look like assholes. 
[01:29:30]  And we give them billions of dollars worth of aid that doesn't even go to the people it  sees.  I know.  Well, that's a bribe to get us to the front of the line of the Suez Canal.  Right, right.  And it's just...  Yeah, but I understand that.  But then you would think that, okay, you would think what...  And this happened with a lot of presidents.  You'd think the president would go, all right, we know this is a bribe, but let's see some  of this money going back into the fucking people.  But it's everyone we're dealing with.  We deal with China on a fucking daily basis.  Huge we deal with China. 
[01:30:00]  They are despicable as far as human rights go.  And the way they treat their people.  There are very wealthy people and very poor people in China.  And that's it.  Right.  Same thing with Egypt.  Egypt, same thing, yeah.  Because there's a lot of people that are very well off.  But when you find out that they only make $2,000 a year, the average person or the average  household...  Righteous bucks.  I knew they were poor, but that's fucking poor.  Yeah, that's doit poor.  And $6.50 for a month?  Yeah, $6.50 a month is minimum wage.  So what does that average out as far as a 40-hour work week? 
[01:30:30]  You think they work 40-hour work weeks or something?  I don't know.  They probably just work all the time.  Well, yes.  And what do you do there?  I picture them just carrying pyramid rocks back and forth.  There doesn't seem to be anything there to do.  I don't know what they do.  Someone asked me that.  I have no idea.  What do they do there?  I know tourism is big, but...  It's a faraway land.  So whatever that means, hotels and fucking camel rides.  Yeah.  And I don't know. 
[01:31:00]  But everyone, every country we deal with is bad.  Like, they're all bad guys.  But I'm thinking, what is the average Egyptian thinking of America if we supported that government  for 30-some ideas?  Yeah, exactly.  But, you know, their government, now they want change.  And we're all like, yeah, change.  Woo-hoo.  They got plenty of change.  Yeah, they got plenty of change.  Works out to four cents an hour?  Four cents an hour.  That's great, man.  You did the math that fast?  I mean, I'm basing this on 40-hour work.  And they probably work more than 40 hours. 
[01:31:30]  So 80, so figure 160 hours, 160 hours a week, you know, and you're getting $6.50 comes  out to four cents an hour.  But they all had cell phones, so that doesn't make sense.  It seemed like everyone in that square had a fucking cell phone.  They only cost a penny there.  See, that's the thing.  They don't make a lot of money, but everything's real cheap.  Made out of rocks.  I guess it's relative in a way.  I don't know.  I guess so.  I don't know, but that was...  Obviously.  That was some great TV, though, wasn't it?  Yeah, it was.  I was just like the stroke reporter, even though she didn't have a stroke. 
[01:32:00]  Uh-huh.  Am I the only one that was hoping for fucking craziness on the live TV on Friday?  Weren't you?  Or Thursday, whatever day it was?  Everybody was.  So I'm not alone with that.  Everyone was.  Like, I was excited for the people that got it done, but you're thinking, oh, fuck,  I was hoping they would have to storm the palace or something.  Yeah.  Nothing.  No, no, it was just kind of a big party.  And now they've been partying since that happened, and now the military's starting to 
[01:32:30]  go, hey, people are going to have to clear out.  Yeah.  We got to get things going.  It's going to be about six months before we can do this, that, the other.  Who's the dummy picking up a broom and sweeping?  I'd be the guy sneaking out the back.  Yeah, fuck that.  Back of the crowd.  And cleaning this shit up.  I'd be the guy, like, I know someone else will do it, so why do I have to do it?  Yeah.  Are you that guy, too?  I would totally do that.  There's actually proactive people that go, no, I have to be the guy with the broom.  I need to do this for my country. 
[01:33:00]  I'll do this.  I want to talk to the guys that snuck out.  Let them.  Went to the back of the fucking crowd and just sauntered off.  Sauntered.  Just sauntered off.  Eh, shit.  So we had that happen, and then I have to acknowledge the greatest hockey game that was played in,  and I can't even make up the years because I don't know.  You were telling me about this.  The Islanders-Penguins game, and I want to thank the people on Twitter because I've really given up on the Islanders. 
[01:33:30]  I mean, what happened with the Penguins brings me back a little bit, absolutely.  Yeah.  But thank you to Twitter because all of a sudden I was on Twitter and people were like, dude, you've got to fucking turn the Islander game on.  I'm like, why?  Why would I do that?  Yeah.  And I actually asked that question.  They said it's not a hockey game.  It's a revenge game.  All it is is one fight after another.  And I forgot what the total was, but I think it was 320, I want to say 325 penalty minutes.  Wow.  There were so many fights in this game. 
[01:34:00]  By the end of the game, the Penguins, I think, only had two guys on the bench, including the guys that were on the ice.  Only two guys left to go to.  So they couldn't even make a line change at the end of the game.  They didn't have enough players.  Wow.  And then the Islanders, I believe, were down to like four or five guys on their bench.  And it was just like cheap shots.  I'll acknowledge this because I had to argue with Penguins fans for the last few days.  Yeah.  There were cheap shots.  It wasn't like now in the NHL, if me and Ann are going to fight on the ice, it's like, you want to go? 
[01:34:30]  Yeah, we're going.  They call each other out.  It's a whole thing that happens.  But this was old school hockey.  And it goes back to what happened at DiPietro.  Like, DiPietro got embarrassed by the Penguins' backup goalie there with the one punch knockout that fractured his face and all that.  And what got the Islanders was the fact that the Penguins were openly laughing at him.  And I was pissed that they were laughing.  But I moved on with my life.  The Islanders didn't.  They said, you know what?  Next time we play you guys, it's going to be payback, motherfuckers.  And I didn't know the ice cred back. 
[01:35:00]  So there were some ugly, ugly fucking fights, man.  And cheap shots.  And guys coming off the bench.  This was like just hockey like it used to be.  Old time hockey.  It was fucking amazing.  I got to catch clips of that because I love hockey fights.  There's a few clips going around.  There's one clip that's 17 minutes long.  And it's the best 17 minutes you could spend in front of your computer.  In front of your iPad.  I'm telling you.  Even if you're not a hockey fan.  Just beating the fuck out of each other. 
[01:35:30]  Dude, fucking.  Cheap shot.  I forgot all the names at this point.  One penguin guy just fucking minding his own business and takes a fist to the side of the face.  Didn't even see it coming.  Then one guy gets in a fight.  And now he's supposed to leave the ice.  And on his way out, he fights the goalie.  Just for the fuck of it?  Dude, it was, I'm saying dude a lot, but it was amazing.  And they get to play again, huh?  They play in April, but the league came down hard.  Like nine, ten game suspensions. 
[01:36:00]  There's going to be cops on skates out on the ice.  The NHL fined the Islanders $100,000.  I don't even know where they're going to get that money at this point.  Yeah, so.  That's like probably a whole take from a whole night of, you know, they're not making any fucking money.  But it was, it was, it was great.  And everyone's talking about this game.  There's been a few of these games this year with some of the teams.  Yeah.  A few games where it's just been all out brawls.  Yeah, what was the Bruins involved in one with the. 
[01:36:30]  Was it with Bruins?  Montreal.  Canadians, right?  Yeah.  Melissa was at the game.  And then my brother writes me and he goes, please tell me you're at this game.  Oh.  And my tickets were in my fucking desk drawer.  I could have been there.  And I probably should have went to that one.  I should have known it was going to be a revenge game.  You never know, though.  Let's go to Melissa.  Melissa.  Hey, good morning.  How are you guys?  Hey, what's up?  Hello.  We, my husband and I actually, it was the first time we took our kids to a game.  Right.  They're five and three.  We're sitting with our friend's church group. 
[01:37:00]  And my husband and I are the only ones drinking beer.  And they had this beautiful servant in the, you know, before, because the guy who passed  away, the cop who passed away.  Yep.  So it's beautiful.  The whole thing, the singing.  Oh, my God.  At one point, there were, they were out on the ice.  Everybody was fighting.  Yeah.  And my husband and I are like, yeah.  And we're sitting in this church group and our kids are like looking at us.  You know, what's going on?  You're loving it.  Yeah.  It was insane.  I mean, at one point, there weren't enough rest to break up the fight. 
[01:37:30]  Like, they were just everywhere.  It was, I was, it was ridiculous.  And of course, you know, my kids are looking at me and they're like, yeah, you're enjoying  this stuff.  But it was, it was awesome.  It was great.  I mean, it was just, it was just.  Of course you're enjoying it.  Of course you're enjoying it.  We haven't seen hockey like that since I was growing up in the eighties with, with hockey  like that, man.  I know.  I mean, nowadays.  It's such a pussy sport.  So now it was really nice to see them.  And it definitely was a revenge game.  Of course it was a revenge game.  And of course the Islanders were taking their cheap shots. 
[01:38:00]  I'll admit it.  Yes.  But they were fucking pissed off that the Penguins were, you know, the bench was laughing  at DPH or going down with one punch.  That was degrading.  So of course they took cheap shots.  Yes.  I'll admit it.  But like nowadays in hockey, if two guys are fighting, then you got other guys on the  ice that kind of want to fight, but they kind of hold each other really tight.  Like don't get involved.  Not during this fucking game, man.  These guys are like, fuck you.  We're fighting.  You're going to fight.  You two over there are going to fight.  You're going to fight over here.  At one point, I think there were four fights going on at the same time. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, there were.  There definitely were.  It was like center ice.  And it was unbelievable because there weren't, there just weren't enough reps either.  Like you could see, like you could see a rep trying to like, he was like in  the middle of it and he's kind of looking at the other fight to see like what's worse.  You know, they're like assessing the situation, but it was, it was, it was pretty amazing.  I mean, but it's so sad.  You know, here they have this beautiful ceremony.  It wasn't sad.  Stop.  Well, the cop who passed away and then they're just beating the shit out of each other on  the ice.  It was two different things.  They did the right thing for the cop. 
[01:39:00]  Obviously that was a great moment.  And then, and then you get to see a, an old school hockey game.  And it was definitely worth the money because usually, I mean, it was funny because my husband  and I were saying as we pulled in and paid our $10 to park, I'm like, how can they even  charge people to park?  They should be freaking paying people to come to these games because, and I said, I was like,  yeah, I said, actually, it'll be through all his tickets.  Not all of them, but a bunch of them.  I've gotten rid of a bunch of them.  Thank you, Melissa.  I appreciate it.  Take care, guys.  Have a great day.  All right.  And then I'm reading an article on the Islanders over the weekend and you know, because of the 
[01:39:30]  Madoff Mets situation, you know, the Islanders are sort of connected to that because one  of the things they might, they wanted to do with the Islanders is, is get a new arena  around Shea Stadium or Citi Field or whatever the fuck they call it now.  And the Islanders would play that.  We'd save the team.  They'd stay on Long Island, but now there's no money to build that fucking arena over there.  So now they're saying that Wang, the owner of the Islanders there is just biding his  time waiting and he's absolutely fucking gone in, I think it would be three years. 
[01:40:00]  And then what?  They move?  I don't know.  Vancouver, Kansas City.  Oh boy.  Or cities that are popping up to take the Islanders.  The Islanders are going to be gone in three years.  Wow.  I don't see how they're not, which is going to be fucking depressing as hell.  Let me say hi to Andy in Pittsburgh.  Andy.  Andy.  Hey, Opa.  Good morning.  Hold on.  King Greg in Oyster Bay just wants to say hockey is gay.  There you go, King Greg.  Hockey is gay.  Your voice has been heard today.  That's just terrific. 
[01:40:30]  Go ahead, Andy.  Hey, I wanted to, I watched that game and I'll tell you what, even though the Penguins  were depleted with injuries and I hated to see the fight go down like that, I was really  proud of the Islanders that they manned up and they settled up like men.  Well, they got some tough guys on that team, the Islanders, man.  Like men.  I think they brought up some guys that have never played hockey before for that game.  I think they brought up some MMA guys.  Just MMA guys coming out there fucking. 
[01:41:00]  But I can't skate.  All you have to do is stand on your skates.  Arm bars.  Because we're going to start the fights before we even drop the puck.  You don't have to skate, my friend.  Just fight.  Just beat the shit out of whoever's in front of you in another uniform.  Get on the ground and then you take away that slippery ice shit.  Yeah.  Well, now the Penns owner Mario is...  Oh, fuck Mario Lemieux.  Mario Lemieux had his fucking time where he was a dirty player.  Yeah, he ain't no choir boy.  Oh, fucking no.  No choir boy.  Well, Mario Lemieux came out and said that the NHL did not do enough. 
[01:41:30]  Really?  They did enough.  They fined him $100,000.  There's 10-game suspensions left and right.  What does that pussy want to fucking comment like that for?  I don't know.  Just like...  Makes him look fruity.  Yeah.  Hey, I got a question for you.  Yeah.  You're a fan.  Sort of.  If a ref goes down and gets hurt, which I've seen before, they go down.  Is there a ref to replace him?  Do they have a substitute ref that comes in and helps out?  Yeah, I think they bring in the hot dog guy. 
[01:42:00]  I think they fucking...  Yeah, they certainly travel with another guy that I'm sure is just sitting around somewhere.  I don't know.  Honestly, I don't know the answer to that.  They've had refs that have gotten injured before.  They don't stop the game.  Do they bring in another guy?  Yeah.  Or do they just say, look, we can handle this game with one less ref on the ice?  I've seen him bring other guys in.  I'm not really sure, to be honest with you.  Well, like the color before, there wasn't enough refs on the ice to break up all the 
[01:42:30]  fights, and if they have extra refs, what the hell were they?  Oh, right.  Throwing another guy on for the rest of the game?  Yeah, we're a man down.  And then it felt bad for the Islanders that made it to the end of the game, because now  they look like wimps for not getting in a fight and throwing out of the fucking game.  Well, Goddard got a 10-game suspension for leaving the ice, or leaving the bench to go  on the ice.  Yeah, that's a no-no, unfortunately.  Old school hockey, you were allowed to jump in, just climb over the boards and get involved  in the fights.  Not anymore.  No. 
[01:43:00]  Thank you, sir.  One more call, then we've got to move on.  Larry in Texas.  Larry.  Larry.  Hi.  Hi.  I was born and raised in western Pennsylvania.  Congratulations.  Thanks for the call.  But DiPietro got what he deserved.  He took a shot at Matt Cook, trying to clothesline Matt Cook, and because in the first game in  Pittsburgh, when the Penguins with the Islanders got shot out by Brent Johnson, and because  nobody can touch DiPietro, Brent Johnson skates the length of the ice, past the waving lines 
[01:43:30]  been trying to head him off, calls out DiPietro, waits for him to get his gear off, and then  clocks him.  DiPietro got what he deserved.  If they want revenge for DiPietro getting his comeuppance, because Brent Johnson's the  only guy that can touch him, and he's not letting him make a run at Matt Cook.  This thing isn't over.  This is like one of these.  And by the way, that's why Lemieux should shut his fucking mouth.  He's got Matt Cook, one of the dirtiest players in the NHL.  So what the fuck is he talking about?  Matt Cook knows how to do some cheap shots himself. 
[01:44:00]  And one game here, not too long ago, somebody made a run at Tyler Kennedy, and Jordan Scott  punched a guy in the back of the head with his glove on, and that didn't get picked up.  I was shocked that Jordan Stahl didn't get a game of his condom.  Larry sounds like the kind of guy that calls in sports radio.  Oh, yeah, I know.  He could call in sports radio.  He knows the names, knows everything.  Dude, this is...  I like this guy.  This is now a rivalry that's going to be around for a really long time, man.  It really is.  Penguins-Irlanders.  And you know what?  It's going to be exciting.  And I don't even want to defend DiPietro. 
[01:44:30]  I was hoping that maybe you guys fucking injured him for good.  He's not doing us any good.  I think he's played in 15 games in two years.  Well, there is that.  And I mean, you notice in Pittsburgh, nobody messes with Conor.  Conor's a little guy, but he's got a short right hand.  He's getting too deep in sports.  Oh, this guy's...  Yeah, this is sports radio stuff.  This guy's sports radio.  Larry, thank you, brother.  We've got to cut you off because we've got to keep it kind of basic where people go, what?  And Ant, there's no extra refs. 
[01:45:00]  Only in the playoffs.  Oh, maybe that's what I was watching.  Maybe that's what I was watching when I saw an extra ref come in.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  This and then we move on.  Kyle in Boston.  Kyle.  Okay.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, the Lemieux thing's even worse.  The final line in that statement was the biggest bitch thing I've ever heard.  You're saying if the league doesn't do more about this, then he may have to reconsider  his involvement with the NHL.  Oh, boy.  Then go.  Shut up, not Gretzky.  Just go. 
[01:45:30]  Enough of Lemieux.  You got Matt Cook.  Enough of him.  And I think Lemieux got into some shit in his career, too.  Of course he did.  Of course he did.  And the league did enough.  Thank you.  Beat up that cancer.  Didn't he?  Of course he did.  Didn't he have lymphoma?  Yeah, he had something.  Dr. Steve could talk now.  I don't know, because now we've got guests piling up. 
[01:46:00]  Who cares about Dr. Steve?  Who cares about Dr. Steve?  We could get him on later or maybe tomorrow.  I've been bummed.  What about the woman that didn't have a stroke that sounded like a lunatic?  Yeah.  All right, we'll break, and we'll do other things.  We've got to talk about Harry Balls.  Yeah.  Harry Balls.  Harry Balls.  We better be able to talk about Harry Balls.  Harry Balls.  Harry?  The way they say it.  Harry.  Harry.  Harry Balls. 
[01:46:30]  But we've got Holt.  Holt is here.  Yeah.  Who's Holt?  He's the star of Lights Out.  I haven't seen Lights Out still.  Phenomenal.  With Stacy Keach.  It's a fantastic show.  I'm too busy watching that Shameless.  I haven't, with William Macy, I haven't seen that.  He's coming in this week.  I know, Friday.  Yeah, check out a couple episodes.  That is a fucked up show, that Shameless.  Yeah.  Fucked up.  He plays like an alcoholic who...  But he's barely in the show.  Yeah.  I thought it was his show.  He shows up drunk.  No, Jimmy's been here.  He just hasn't been interested in anything we've been talking about for the first hour of the show. 
[01:47:00]  Read my Twitter, sir.  Two hours.  I was on the fucking LIE hour-late flight.  I'm really...  It was just one of those...  Wait, you flew to JFK?  And his arms are killing him.  Yeah.  You flew to...  No, no, no.  I was on a plane.  Oh, literal.  Yeah, I had to.  That was...  But it wouldn't have mattered.  Coming in from Lincoln would have been bad, too.  Nightmare.  It might have been worse coming from Jersey, because the Lincoln would have been 45-minute delays.  I don't know.  That LIE is a nightmare.  Flight was an hour-late.  I call it the Budinsky Tunnel. 
[01:47:30]  But yeah, fucking Lights Out.  I like that show so much.  I had Roland a fucking begging grovel to get me...  I didn't want to wait for it to run.  I wanted to see what happens.  I haven't seen the whole season.  All right, so you'll be able to talk to Holt.  Yeah, I love Holt.  Because I haven't seen Lights Out yet.  It's phenomenal.  All right, we'll talk to him next.  Stay there.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Damn it.  On the virus.  Sirius XM. 
[01:48:00]  Of course not.  Got a busy show today.  Waiting for our guest.  He had to go take a dump.  Is he going potty?  He had to make poopies.  Morning poopies.  Holt McAllen-y?  Is that how you say his name?  I think so, yeah.  From Lights Out.  I love the show, man.  It's a really, really good show.  Yes. 
[01:48:30]  I can only watch one show at a time, man.  And I'm watching two right now.  I got The Shameless.  I'm only a couple episodes in on Shameless.  Macy, in the first episode, he's barely in it.  I guess as the series goes on, he's a big part of the show.  And then I'm watching that in Idiot Abroad.  What happened?  I got shocked when I sat down.  Oh, yeah.  My little headphones.  When you sit down, yeah.  Oh, Idiot Abroad is with the Gervais show.  I love it.  I love Carl.  Carl rules.  I hope he does interviews.  I want to talk to Carl.  Carl's hysterical. 
[01:49:00]  Fucking hilarious.  Did you see the Mexican one when he went to Mexico?  No, I saw the one when we went to Israel.  Israel, yeah.  And Jordan.  Yeah, that was good.  Yeah.  Petra?  Or Petra?  Or what, that ancient city in the middle of the desert?  Yeah, yeah.  Carved into the stone.  Carved into the stone.  He said it would be better to live in the place across.  It's kind of brilliant to say that.  Because then you could look at how nice that is.  Because if you lived in the place that's all carved out nice, you'd have to look at an ugly cave across the way.  Logically makes a lot of sense. 
[01:49:30]  And logically also, when he's talking about the pyramids and how they're stupid because it's got so much space on the first floor, but the attic barely has any room.  It's hysterical.  Some people say that he's not real.  Like he's like an improv guy.  I don't think he could be that stupid.  Well, he's not stupid though.  He kind of has a spaz thing.  It's like an idiot.  Or like a, yeah, yeah.  We've had a lot of these guys over the years on our show, maybe not as great as Carl, where on the surface they look really dumb, but they really say very intelligent, smart things at times. 
[01:50:00]  The animated podcast part, he's constantly talking about insects.  And it's hysterical, his take on insects.  But I'm thinking if he was a really good improv guy, we would have known of Carl before now.  You think it's a set up?  Some people are saying that maybe he's just an improv guy and they're trying to like, you know.  I think working for this show, I have more faith in him being completely real.  Yeah, we've seen this.  There's no way Bobo's real. 
[01:50:30]  There's no way Oscar's real.  But it's like David.  Let's not forget.  Iraq's got a comment.  Beginning of the Mexico episode where they're comparing the pyramids from Egypt to the ones in Mexico.  And they're saying the ones in Egypt are a place of rebirth and afterlife.  But the ones in Mexico were for sacrifice and death.  And he's like, oh, that makes sense.  Like he couldn't understand the ones in Egypt for rebirth, but he could understand being killed.  Did you explain that one again?  No.  Yeah, it's all really flat.  Really, really, really flat.  The best part was that, and this is what people can't see, Eric just went, no, and put the mic on. 
[01:51:00]  Oh, no.  And as far as like living across the street, he says the same is true being an ugly person.  He's like, why be a good looking person?  Then all you get to see is ugly people.  Why not be the ugly person?  And then you get to see all the beautiful people and appreciate them more.  He's a...  They just send...  The guest is walking into fucking E-Rock's studio.  I just told Roland, bring him in there.  Hey, Roland.  What are they doing?  They're sending you somewhere else? 
[01:51:30]  Good, good.  You too.  We got Holt from Lights Out.  What's going on, sir?  How you doing, man?  Why were they walking you into...  Who was walking him down?  I don't know.  Roland just walked in with him.  I said, bring him in there.  Roland.  Wow, maybe Roland's having a stroke like that reporter.  Yeah, Roland's freaking out.  Yeah, that was kind of weird.  I think he just marched by him.  I guess he said, fuck the show, and he's going to the Shady.  Yeah, whatever.  Whatever the fuck it's called.  I don't know.  How you doing, Holt?  Good?  Great.  Thanks for having me on, guys.  Jimmy's a big fan of Lights Out.  Yeah.  I haven't been able to check it out yet.  I got too many shows I got to catch up with. 
[01:52:00]  But Jimmy's all in with Lights Out.  We had Stacey Keech in.  Stacey Keech plays my dad.  And he's a fantastic actor.  I just saw him this weekend.  He's doing a play at Lincoln Center called Other Desert Cities, which got rave reviews.  And he's tremendous in it.  And he's moving to Broadway.  And I think he'll probably get nominated for a Tony Award.  He's just a superb actor.  And you sound a little like Stacey Keech.  Yeah, I was just noticing you have a good radio voice, too.  Thanks.  You want to do two for Tuesday or something? 
[01:52:30]  I've often said that, you know, they could have looked for a long time, but they never  could have found a better actor to play my father than Stacey Keech.  Because, first of all, we look alike.  We sound alike.  Yeah, there is kind of a resemblance.  You are handsomer, though.  I have to say that.  You're a little handsomer than Stacey.  Well, but look at those old pictures of him as Mike Hammer and stuff.  You know, when he had the mustache and the hat and he played that private eye on TV  in the 80s.  He was a pretty good looking guy.  Kareeb.  When he was on Kareeb.  That was back in the 70s, I think.  Wow.  He goes back a long way. 
[01:53:00]  No, he goes back a long way.  Yeah, yeah.  He's been on some shit for years.  Twinkle, Twinkle, Killer Kane.  Did that get renamed to something else?  Really?  Yeah, Twinkle, Twinkle, Killer Kane.  I love that.  Yeah.  How about Fat City?  Remember the great John Musilk film?  Oh, my God.  Oh, sorry.  I'm sorry, Eric.  Oh, that was a good one.  Poor E-Rock.  Oh, he's getting hammered.  He's going to come in with a gun.  He really is.  Just took a beating earlier, too.  Oh, did he?  I'm sorry, E-Rock.  I think we reached our E-Rock quota.  All right.  By 620 today.  Okay.  No more beating up E-Rock.  You smell really good, by the way.  Thank you so much. 
[01:53:30]  That's kind of homoerotic to say to a man who plays a fighter when he comes in.  Yeah, yeah.  But I noticed he smells lovely.  Nice.  What is it?  It's called Landstall by Gurlain.  It's L-apostrophe-I-N-S-T-A-N-T.  And I went to find a new cologne, and I was at Saks, and there was a beautiful girl helping  me, and she came over to me, and she goes, this one's really sexy.  And I went, you know what?  That's all it took, huh?  Sold.  I don't even have to try it.  Just wrap it up.  Yeah, that's a smart... 
[01:54:00]  That's smart, man.  I don't understand the ones that have a...  A lot of them have a gay guy spritzing at you.  It's like, no, you're not the guy I want to fucking bring in.  Have the hot chick do it.  You play a boxer, and I know your brother was a boxer, and he died years ago.  That's correct, yeah.  And does this, is it weird to play a fighter, like, does that bring back memories, or do  you like take anything from what he was like as a fighter and kind of use that in the role?  Because you play a very convincing fighter.  Well, thanks.  You know, boxing has always been my favorite sport. 
[01:54:30]  And I started boxing when I was at...  You know how older brothers have a tendency to beat their little brothers up?  Ah, yeah.  You know, you love him, but he's your little brother.  So you slap him around, you know what I mean, a couple of times a week just to remind him  that you're the big brother and he's the little brother.  And, you know, after several, you know, years of this, my little brother decided that he  was going to go and learn how to fight.  So he became a Golden Gloves champion boxer, and I realized, wait a minute, it's not as 
[01:55:00]  hard to rough this guy up as it used to.  I mean, not as easy to rough this guy up.  Not as easy, yeah, yeah.  So I went down and I started taking boxing lessons and stuff, and we really, we used to  box together, and we really enjoyed it.  And so from that point forward, you know, I had really had the desire in me to compete  in the amateurs.  The problem is, you know, I started my acting career very young, and I went on that journey.  And although I continued to box recreationally, you know, it just never seemed like, do you 
[01:55:30]  know what I mean?  Something that I was going to invest in.  And that's a hard thing to do both of, box and acting, because the boxing will certainly  ruin some of the things you need for acting, like a face.  Well, you know, that's the thing that you kind of have to get over, and I think that's  the reason that a lot of actors kind of shy away from it.  But, you know, the truth of it, and the great, you know, guys that I know, like my friend  who's a Teddy Atlas, who's one of the great boxing trainers of all time, and a lot of professional 
[01:56:00]  fighters I know will tell you this.  You played him, right?  I played him in a movie for HBO called Tyson, about Mike Tyson.  Right, yeah.  In the mid-90s.  And he and I formed a long friendship.  You do get hit.  You cannot get in the ring and not get hit.  But fighters don't get hit in training with as many big shots as people probably think.  Remember now, you know, you're keeping your hands up.  You're moving your head.  You're using your legs.  Do you know what I'm trying to say?  You're trying to think, you know, defensively. 
[01:56:30]  You're trying to get rounds in.  Do you know what I'm trying to say?  You know, you spar with a headgear.  So, yeah, you're going to take shots.  But you're not getting creamed.  But it's not putting your nose over on the side of your face.  Hopefully, hopefully, hopefully not.  Now, you know, I mean, guys, you know, I mean, look, if you look at, you know, guys' faces,  and it varies from guys to guys.  Like, you could look at, for example, Oscar De La Hoya's face.  Oscar De La Hoya's face.  Who could look at his face with those legs in a dress? 
[01:57:00]  He's a pretty kid.  I don't know whether I should fight him or fuck him.  Well, there you go.  He's still beautiful after all those fights.  That's what I'm trying to say, you know?  So, it's not necessarily true that just because you're interested in boxing that you're going  to end up, you know, with a face that looks like, you know, Carmen Basilio or something.  Did you find, like, I have to, I don't know if anybody else picked, because Holt's a really  nice guy and really, like, a nice energy.  But I'm looking at your, Holt is fucking crazy. 
[01:57:30]  Like, I'm watching, you are, I can see.  You think it could be a problem?  Oh, yeah.  Really?  Because I'm watching him, like, have this gentlemanly demeanor, but I'm like, that's  the explaining of something before he has a violent outburst.  Did you fight a lot growing up?  You looked like you had a lot.  Yeah, I was a rebellious kid.  I got kicked out of every school that I ever attended, you know, and I knew that I wanted  to be an actor from a very early age, but although my parents were both actors, they  were Broadway actors, I couldn't convince them to allow me to become a child actor. 
[01:58:00]  I wanted them to call up, get me an agent, let me go out there, go on auditions.  I would go and see movies.  I would watch TV.  There were young people.  You know, there are young people.  Yeah, I can do that.  Why can't I do it?  Why can't I have my, you know, my shot to do it?  And they were determined that I should have a normal, quote-unquote, childhood.  And I was unhappy about that, so I was a really, really rebellious kid.  And you ran away?  I did.  I ran away from home when I was 14 years old, and I took a Greyhound bus out to L.A. 
[01:58:30]  to try to become a movie star.  Wow.  Yeah.  And I ended up with a job in a screwdriver factory in Gardena, California, unloading  trucks.  Does anybody creepy, a 14-year-old young Midwestern lad gets to L.A., any creepy, there had to  be some kind of creep predator at the fucking bus stop.  You know what?  I was a precocious kid, you know?  The thing that I remember about the Greyhound bus ride, you know, it was the 70s, you know?  And my mother's from Omaha, Nebraska. 
[01:59:00]  She was Miss Nebraska in the Miss America pageant.  That's how she got into show business.  You know, she came to New York, and she worked first at, like, the Copacabana, you know,  as a chorus girl, then for Barbara Walters' father, Lou Walters, at a place that he had  in the 40s and 50s called the Latin Quarter, and she became a band singer, which is a big  deal in those days.  So she'd been around, but she was a small-town girl originally.  She was from Omaha, Nebraska.  So after my parents divorced, and she was, like, on the road and stuff, she sent us back  to be raised by her parents in Omaha. 
[01:59:30]  Well, I was a showbiz kid, and nothing against the fine people of Omaha, because I had, you  know, a great childhood there, and I still have many friends there.  Not a big showbiz place.  And it's a great town.  Yeah.  But if you decide that you're going to be an actor, right?  Yeah, you've got to leave.  Acting is, in a sense, geographical.  Do you see what I mean?  There are certain places in America where you can aspire to become an actor.  Omaha's a bad place for acting, even if you're playing a person who lives in Nebraska.  Omaha's a bad place to become an actor.  Well, there's a big Shakespeare company, I think, somewhere out there that Hanks did 
[02:00:00]  some kind of a thing with.  No, that's the Great Lakes Shakespeare Festival.  That was in Cleveland, Ohio.  And I was in the same.  My very first job in the theater was Tom Hanks' first job, too.  It's as an apprentice actor, so you're non-paid, and you're trying to get your equity card  at the Great Lakes Shakespeare Festival in Cleveland.  He and I did the same thing.  As an equity, now here's the thing.  As a guy who's doing an apprenticeship, do you kind of root for the guy to die?  Like, you have to root for an accident or something?  No, that's when you're the understudy. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, understudy.  When you're the understudy, well, no, I remember, like, my first big job in New York City was  as an understudy in the Broadway production of Neil Simon's Biloxi Blues.  Oh, wow.  You may remember that play.  It was a big hit.  Like, in 1985, it won the Tony Award.  They made a movie out of it with Matthew Broderick and Christopher Walken.  And it's about a group of young guys, you know, that are at boot camp in Mississippi right  before World War II.  And it's kind of a semi-autobiographical thing, I think, about Neil's experiences, you know, 
[02:01:00]  as a young man.  Do you think he had the homosexual encounter in the shower?  Do you think that was Neil?  Like, that was the one, right?  Where the one guy jumped out the window?  Right.  I hope that wasn't what Neil was fucking doing.  Remember that scene?  No, I never asked him.  I never asked him.  But, no, I think, you know, I think Neil is straight, you know?  No, you never know.  Doc Simon, he can't be...  You can be very straight and still have...  I'm not saying I have, but I'm saying some people are very straight.  They've had the occasional encounters. 
[02:01:30]  No, but I remember as an understudy, I would go around to these guys and I would say, you  know, I was covering four guys.  I would say, hey, man, can you just let me have one performance?  How about a Wednesday matinee?  Just so I could bring my agent and my parents.  Can't you be sick for me?  Just one day?  Take a Sunday matinee.  Yeah, right?  Any day you want.  Just give me one day so I can get on one time.  And they'd be like, fuck you.  You know, most of those guys, though, are out of the business now.  So I think, you know, karma comes around to bite you in the ass.  I would have done it for them.  You never got on the stage for that play? 
[02:02:00]  Can you imagine this?  I mean, I come to New York, right?  Both my parents are Broadway actors.  My father won a Tony Award as a producer in 1970.  My mother is a Broadway actress with a career that spans decades.  My first job is on Broadway in the Tony-winning play of the season.  And I'm covering four different guys.  So I got four shots.  And all I'm looking for is one performance.  I stand by for six months.  These are all young guys my age. 
[02:02:30]  And I say to each of them in turn, I say, look, you know, I will be eternally indebted  to you, man.  And if you can just take one performance off, just let me bring my mother and father.  And they said no.  Just let me bring my agent.  Just let me bring.  And they said no.  And, you know, if you're listening.  Is it a fear, though, that you would be better than them and take their gig?  Because I don't know if I would give a guy who is obviously a good actor, because what  if all of a sudden they realize that I'm, because, you know, we're all panicking.  I'm sure there's some paranoia there. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  And like, you're good and you're handsome.  That takes place.  Like, you might take the fucking gig.  I'm sure.  Yeah.  Well, you know, they have the job, and I'm the understudy, you know, so I think really  they're in a position, if they want to be cool about it, and they want to do me a solid,  they can do it.  You should have made them sick.  Yeah, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Find someone that's got the flu or something.  Like a left hook, right hand.  Oh, fuck.  A little crushed glass in the omelet, like how they got fucking an Oz.  Who was the old mobster they killed on Oz with a crushed glass in his food? 
[02:03:30]  That's always a good slow way to do it.  I'll loosen some of the ropes above.  Let something fall in their head.  Yeah, too bad you weren't fucking Spider-Man.  You had six shots of that.  Jesus, you would have been tired from replacing those guys.  So six months and you got nothing.  So six months and I never got on, but you know what?  It led to a lot of other jobs, and, you know, and I've been very lucky with my job.  And, hey, I'm sitting here with you guys now, so, you know, it's a long time ago.  I've let it go.  What episode are you guys on now?  Because I like, we saw the first, I think we had the first five before Stacey came in. 
[02:04:00]  And I got kind of addicted to it.  And I hate to wait for a show week by week, so I just begged Roland that he got it.  And I'm almost on the last episode.  Whereabouts are you guys now?  Number, tonight, episode number six will air.  Okay.  On FX at 10 p.m., 9 central.  And this is the episode in which my character, Lights Leary, begins his comeback in earnest.  I've decided that I'm going to get back in the ring. 
[02:04:30]  You know, I have a lot of money problems, you know, and I've got problems with the IRS,  and I can't pay my mortgage.  And I've got, so I've decided that I'm going to get back in the ring.  And I take a fight against a very dangerous opponent, a guy named El Diablo, who is kind  of like a...  Coming out of prison.  Coming out of prison.  Coming out of prison, kind of like a Ricardo Mayorga type, you know, really volatile, like  explosive Latin fighter, very dangerous guy.  And I start my training. 
[02:05:00]  And a lot of, you know, my wife has kicked me out of the house.  Because, you know, I've severed my relationship with my brother because he's betrayed me.  By the way, the wife is a very...  Everyone's a good actor, but I'm like so fucking annoyed because she's nagging, breaking his  balls.  He wants to fight.  I'm like, would you shut up, woman?  Fucking women ruin everything.  Why would you ever want to fight?  I didn't hear anything after you saying that I fight a guy that comes out of prison.  Why would you want to fight a guy coming out of prison?  And it's his first fight. 
[02:05:30]  Would you want to fight him when he's had a few fights under his belt after prison?  Yeah.  The thing is, you know, you're trying to...  He wasn't my first choice.  I had a hand-picked guy that I knew that I could essentially...  That I knew that I could beat.  A guy that I had sparred with over the years and somebody...  But they broke his hands.  You know, somebody did.  Somebody...  And I'm not sure who it is.  Was it this corrupt promoter?  Was it this mob guy from Jersey? 
[02:06:00]  But it's actually a great scene.  I don't know if you remember a wonderful old boxing movie from the 50s called The Setup.  With Robert Ryan.  It's a Robert Wise film.  But it's kind of like an homage to that.  You know, once you break a fighter's hands, he's out of business.  Done.  Permanently.  Yeah.  Because there are so many delicate little bones in the hand that trying to get them all  to heal...  The way he's describing this right now, this is a discussion he's had while threatening 
[02:06:30]  to break somebody's hand.  That's how I know he's fucking crazy.  Because like all those little delicate bones...  Like explaining to somebody, I'm going to break your hands if you don't do this.  And here's what's going to happen.  Yeah.  And that's him trying to get them to just please don't make me break your hands.  Interesting you say that because the fighter...  Yes.  Did you see the fighter first of all?  Not only did I see it, I saw it twice.  I saw the very first screening in New York, you know, where we had a Q&A with David O. Russell  and Mark Wahlberg.  Those guys are friends of mine.  I did a movie for them called Three Kings back in the 90s. 
[02:07:00]  And Irish Mickey Ward, who is the subject of the film, is also a friend of mine.  He came to my premiere.  He and I serve on the same...  I saw that film and the first thing I said to the friend of mine I was with was, they  should wrap up the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and mail it to Christian Bale.  It's the same guy.  You know, I was just hanging out with them a couple of weeks ago at the after party for  the Screen Actors Guild Award. 
[02:07:30]  And, you know, I was there with Dickie Eklund.  And I walk in and, you know, I see Mickey Ward and Mickey's a friend of mine.  And I came up, you know, congratulations, Mickey.  You know, Melissa Leo won for playing his mom and Christian won for playing his brother.  And the film has been nominated for seven Academy Awards and it's a tremendous success and it's  changed his life and it couldn't happen to a nicer guy.  You really can't find a nicer guy than Mickey Ward and I mean that.  And I came, hey, Mickey, how you doing?  You know, what's going on?  He goes, hey, you want to meet my brother? 
[02:08:00]  And I had never met Dickie Eklund.  So I said, sure, let's go over there.  I go over there and there's Dickie and he's dancing with these two kind of fat chicks.  You know what I mean?  And, you know, it's just and he's really crazy and flamboyant and outrageous and over the top.  And like you see him from 12 feet away and his energy and you go, oh, my God, there's that character.  And I tell you what, when you spend a few minutes in Dickie Eklund's presence, then you really are convinced that Christian Bale has to win the Academy Awards. 
[02:08:30]  Oh, really?  Oh, my God.  Do you think Dickie Eklund knocked down Sugar Ray Leonard?  Did he slip?  That was a big point of contention in the movie.  They didn't really tie that up.  And it was amazing to me how important that was to him, as it would be to any fighter.  Like, it was, you know, it was a slip.  And one guy said that to him, you know, he slipped.  Like, someone said that to fucking needle him.  And I actually watched the real footage on YouTube and you can't tell when he steps over Sugar Ray.  Yeah.  Hey, is Dickie still partying? 
[02:09:00]  You know, I can't answer that question.  That was a big part of the film.  You know.  Well, you know, you've been around long enough to know, though.  Yeah.  Is the guy partying or what?  Well, I mean, look, he looked like he was having a few drinks with these chicks that he was dancing with.  But whether that means that he's back on the crack pipe, I can't answer that question.  Sure.  I lost it.  But if he was drinking, that's, you know.  If he was drinking, that's, you know.  That's bad, too.  Yeah.  But, you know, I think with that guy, he has that kind of manic energy when he's stone cold sober.  Right, right.  So he might have been sober.  That's just him, you know. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  I hope so.  I hope so.  I hope so, too.  Because, you know.  The only reason I brought that movie, by the way, because they break Wahlberg's hand in the movie.  And it didn't affect him.  Well, that's a thing of, like, you're right.  The cops, remember?  Oh, right.  They broke his fucking hand.  Look, a lot of fighters end up, a lot of them, having multiple surgeries on the knuckles of their hand.  There's a condition called boxer's knuckle.  You know what I mean?  I had surgery on the knuckles of my hand, you know, because the abuse, the punishment that your fists take, you know, constantly, hitting, hitting, hitting. 
[02:10:00]  You know, you develop problems, but, you know, you work with it.  But at a certain point, if all of the bones, and, you know, there are 27 different bones in the, you know what I'm trying to say?  Yeah.  All the bones are broken in one of your hands.  It's a very difficult injury to come back from for a fighter.  Well, that's why they broke his hand.  They wanted to make a statement in the movie. 
[02:10:30]  Right.  So, it was like, what was the movie where they broke the thumbs?  That was in Newman, one in Newman.  No, no, no, they chopped it off.  They chopped it off at Pope.  Was it the, oh, uh.  The Hustler.  The Hustler.  When they broke his fucking, uh, broke his thumbs for Hustle and Pull.  And with the two casts on his hands, can't do anything.  Yeah, I would just hate to have my right hand broken.  The left arm you can lop off.  It's just the one hand I can't live without.  Oh, poor Jimmy.  You do a tremendous job, though, man.  You're crazier in person than I would have thought, though, because it's like a lot 
[02:11:00]  of actors play this character, uh, and you play a great, a great boxer.  You play a really great fucking boxer.  It's very believable, uh, you know, the interaction with the daughter.  The whole, the whole story is, is very, very believable.  But, uh, in person, you're even, you're kind of nuts, man.  I kind of like that.  And, and, and he was in Fight Club.  Yeah, I love the fact.  I was in Fight Club.  Fight Club.  One of the greatest movies ever.  Yeah.  Fucking can't get enough of that movie to this day.  And fucking, uh, Alien franchise.  Come on, Alien 3.  And that was the same director.  David Fincher.  Yeah, yeah.  Alien 3 was David's first movie. 
[02:11:30]  To be part of that franchise is, like, to me, huge.  Because that, that's like my, my favorite movies of all times are the Alien movies.  And, uh, it's pretty fucking cool.  Yeah.  You think, uh, you think David Fincher can make a movie or what?  You know, uh, it's funny.  We were just having this conversation.  Holy shit.  You know, I think that, I think that, and we'll, and we'll know, you know, 20, 25 years from  now, because David is still a young man.  He's in his mid-40s.  That's it.  Right.  I think David Fincher is going to remembered, be remembered as one of the greatest filmmakers  of all time.  I mean, it's clear that he's one of the best filmmakers of his generation. 
[02:12:00]  But this guy has such amazing talent.  Uh, and he's got so many years left to make films.  And he's, and he's so driven and ambitious as a filmmaker.  And he's, I, I, I think that, uh, social network.  He did.  And I think he's going to win the Oscar for it.  Fuck.  You like social network.  I did.  Um, the guy who put the guy who was, uh, Eisenberg, his name is, I think, or he played, he was  tremendous.  Um, you know, I heard he was a little aloof in person. 
[02:12:30]  That's just what I heard from some people at NBC, but, uh, you know, still a great actor.  Great job.  Jesse Eisenberg.  His name is.  Right, right, right.  Yeah.  Is Shane here?  Oh yeah.  We got, we got Shane Leslie coming in today too.  You got Shane in today?  Yeah.  Oh wow.  Yeah.  You know, I've met Shane several times.  As a matter of fact, I called him, uh, to ask him if he would, uh, if he would be on  Lights Out.  We'd like to have him on, you know, uh, to do, uh, to do a cameo because, uh, we're huge  fans.  Oh, we'll get that working for you.  Okay.  Yeah. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  We'll get, we'll get that.  You should hit him when you pass him in the hall.  Just strike him for not calling you back or fucking saying no.  Just give him a good belt.  All right.  Well, uh, how do you say the last name is?  McAllen.  It is McAllen.  Okay.  Uh, I'm a tremendous fan.  I think you're great.  Thank you very much.  And Lights Out is Tuesdays at 10 o'clock on FX.  We had Stacey in and now Holt.  And, uh, it's really a great show and, uh, I am addicted to it.  And I, unfortunately, most people just can't, can't fucking grovel and get the DVDs.  But, uh, I am on the next to the last episode and it's just, I love where the story goes  and it's fucking, it's fantastic, man. 
[02:13:30]  And I hope it's doing well.  Well, thank you guys.  Thanks so much for having me on.  All right.  A lot of them coming on, man.  Definitely Holt.  I appreciate it.  You can see us.  Come right back.  Yeah, we got Sugar Shane Mosley next.  Stay there.  Call the Open Anthony Show now.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's 866-969-1969.  Looking for Sugar Shane Mosley. 
[02:14:00]  Sugar Shane Mosley.  I'm Mosley.  Where's, uh, where's the Sugar?  Where's the Sugar?  What is it?  I'm not asking you, Ken.  I know you don't know.  A little Sugar.  I see, uh, kind of an entourage down the hall.  Oh, okay.  Oh, wow.  I see an entourage kind of forming down the hall.  I see a boom mic.  Oh, yeah.  We got Showtime again today?  Did they like us?  Well, did they use the FADAR footage?  It wasn't a FADAR footage.  That was, uh, for Frank Shamrock.  They're probably not done with that yet.  Oh, okay, good. 
[02:14:30]  I think that was for Frank they were doing that.  FADAR lost again.  Oh, Frank is better?  Oh, Frank.  FADAR lost again.  Two fights in a row.  Rumor has he might retire.  I was at the Improv that night, and I was, like, trying so hard not to see results.  I'm like, I just wanted to go watch it real quick.  So I finally find the video, and it says, uh, Silva upsets FADAR before the video.  I'm like, why would you say that?  Oh, God, what fucking assholes.  How was the fight?  I did not see it.  I only saw a moment of it.  I didn't watch the whole thing. 
[02:15:00]  I just, I literally just saw that when they, when the doctor stopped it, I watched it on  my iPhone, because there was no, they didn't have Showtime with the Improv.  FADAR's not going to retire?  I don't know.  I think that guy outweighed him by a lot of fucking weight, though.  Yeah.  He outhad him by, like, 45, 50 pounds.  Yeah.  Uh, I chatted with Rogan for a bit on the phone, and he said that, uh, he was probably  285 to FADAR's 235.  Damn.  Well, fuck.  Well, this is going to be a scene in a minute or two.  Holy shit.  Look at this.  This is like an entourage, a film crew.  Entourage-y.  Oh, my God. 
[02:15:30]  Uh, there's Sugar Shane Mosley.  There he is.  How you doing?  What's up, Sugar?  Take a seat, sure.  Shane Mosley.  Take a seat.  What's going on, sir?  Got quite the crew with you, I see.  Hi, Shane.  How are you?  Yeah.  Got the CBS crew with me.  Oh, yeah.  I like it.  Hi, cameraman.  I like that.  How are you, man?  How you doing?  Let's go.  Hello, sir.  Look at this.  Camera guys.  Damn, man.  Look at that.  Are you at Showtime or CBS?  Oh, good.  Okay. 
[02:16:00]  Actually, both.  All right.  Yeah.  Notice what self-centered asses we are.  He's fighting.  He's fighting soon.  We're making it about ourselves.  Like, how do we look?  Are we photographing well?  I don't care.  Obviously.  Obviously.  Yeah.  Could you use one of those soft lenses, please?  Are you the one doing all the press for this, or is Pacquiao doing any stuff?  No, Pacquiao's doing some stuff.  I think he's going to be driving to our train in D.C.  Okay.  And we're just going to do some press there. 
[02:16:30]  When do you actually fight?  When is the actual fight, and how do people see it?  The fight is going to be May 7th, and it's going to be at the MGM Grand in Vegas.  Nice.  Great place, man.  And it's going to be showed on Showtime, pay-per-view.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Do you think that, it seems like with MMA taking off and stuff, like boxing, like there's  very few, like, names, like yourself and Pacquiao and Mayweather, but there's just not  as many guys in boxing that people are running to see.  It's like, I think that people are just happy that two big fighters are finally fighting. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, it seems a little bit.  I mean, there's a lot of great fighters out there that are just not being promoted, or  promoter, I guess, that's not being shown, and maybe we need to get these fighters out  there like that so the fans can start by some more.  I think this is a step towards it by CBS coming and following us on regular TV, so a lot of  the, you know, people that can't get cabled. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, mainstream.  Mainstream people, yeah.  Everyone in the middle America, yep.  Right, they can come and watch the show or be interested in the show and in fighting.  You know, CBS and Showtime are, I guess, sister companies, so they're kind of connected.  Well, weren't you with, you were with Golden Boy, I think, right, which is De La Hoya's,  and I didn't understand why, I don't know all the ins and outs, but to get this fight,  like, you really lobbied for this fight, like, you wanted to fight Pacquiao.  Yeah, I mean, you know, I've been friends with Bob Barum, you know, before, you know, 
[02:18:00]  the Golden Boy.  I was actually, when Oscar was with the top rank, if you will, and that's when I kind  of met Bob Barum, and I had some fights on him as well.  This fight is happening in my own promotional company, Sugar Shea Most Promotion, so, you  know, that's what makes it pretty good.  Why did you have to leave them to get the fight?  Did they not want you to have this fight?  Actually, I think, maybe there was lobbying for somebody, I think there was lobbying for  Marquez to get the fight, for the Golden Boy banner. 
[02:18:30]  I didn't know that at the time, but, you know, I just went out and said, you know, I need  to go out on my own and try to get this fight.  And you said, too, because, you know, everyone was talking for a while about Mayweather fighting  Pacquiao, and you said that you feel like you're doing Floyd's dirty work.  Yeah, I mean, you know, Mayweather, this was Mayweather's fight, if I didn't take it.  I mean, you know, if he didn't take it, then who else was going to fight him? 
[02:19:00]  I would definitely, you know, I was definitely the man, you know, for the job, if he didn't  want to take it.  And I understood that, because Bob Barum made it, you know, very clear that if Mayweather  stepped in and said he wanted to fight, then that fight was going to take place.  He didn't step in, and I'm here getting ready to fight Manny Pacquiao.  You fought Mayweather, too, and he won on the decision, but you really, you hit him hard.  Like, I think you probably, you came closer to really slamming him down than anybody has. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  Was he a harder fighter than you thought, or was he an easier guy?  No, I mean, I knew he was going to be a hard fighter.  He's more of a technical fighter that you have to, he's more of a strategic type of fight  than an actual battle.  I think with Pacquiao, it's going to be more of a warrior battle type of fight.  Why do you think that he, and I know you can't speak for him, but everybody talked about Mayweather  Pacquiao.  I think he's 41-0.  Do you think he's afraid to fight Pacquiao?  Because what was the whole thing?  You'll know better than I would. 
[02:20:00]  He wanted Pacquiao to take an additional test before the fight that Pacquiao didn't want  to take.  What was that whole?  Yeah, I mean, there's different things.  You know, they talk about the test, and then they talk about who's going to get the most  money, the fight, who's going to get the best promotion.  I mean, there's a lot of things that go with it.  I guess they have, and they had to go back and forth, and they couldn't come to agreement.  You know, Pacquiao being congressman over there in the Philippines, he's not going to back  down to Mayweather's threats and what his demands, and Mayweather's not going to back 
[02:20:30]  down to Pacquiao's demands or Bob Arum, and they just go back and forth.  You know, it's kind of silly, but money, they're both fighting for the big stake.  They could have probably both made $25 or $30 million apiece, maybe.  I don't see much fighting in that.  You tell me $30 million, it might be in there with Klitschko.  Yeah, it really is amazing that two guys can't agree to split $50 million or $70 million.  I guess if you're on Mayweather's side, you want $50 million and you want the other guy 
[02:21:00]  to get $30 million, there's a point of contention, but it really doesn't seem like that's a...  Yeah, you just spit down the middle.  I mean, money, you never count somebody else's money.  You count your own money.  So if they say you're going to make $30 million to fight this guy, and he's going  to make $30 million, I mean, that's fine, or he makes $50 million.  I mean, what do you want to do?  Who cares?  You still got $30 million.  How much money do you want to fight this fight?  Right.  And that should be the question.  I would be happy.  I mean, just for me, I don't fight. 
[02:21:30]  I mean, I look like I'm in fighting shape, but I'm really not a fighter.  But there's nobody I wouldn't fight for $30 million.  I don't understand.  No!  The medical bills.  One quick...  You know how fast I would...  I have what you call...  What's worse than a glass jaw?  Like, what's one step below a glass jaw?  You have a graham cracker jaw.  Yeah, sand.  My jaw is sand.  And you actually, you go the distance a lot more than a lot of fighters.  Like, a lot of your fights seem to be based on decisions.  And is that because you have great cardio, or is it something that... 
[02:22:00]  Why does that happen for you, and a lot of guys just seem to end a little faster?  Well, I mean, I have a great chance.  I don't go down usually.  I mean, early in my career, I had a lot of knockouts.  I knock a lot of people out.  And as you can see, I mean, I hurt...  39 knockouts.  Let's just get that out there, okay?  46 wins, 39 knockouts.  Wow.  How good does it feel to knock somebody out?  Like, when you hit... 
[02:22:30]  That's my goal.  That's my goal.  It's good.  Yeah.  It's a good feeling.  I mean, it ends the fight a little bit earlier than usual.  Sometimes.  And, you know, because the work down, the work rate, but it's a good feeling.  When you see somebody that you fought...  I always wanted this about fighters.  And, like, let's say it's a guy who has beaten you.  Does that change the dynamic in person when you guys see each other?  Like, you guys, when you're talking, you both know that he won.  Or if it's a guy you're beaten, you've beaten...  Do you look at him like, we both know I kicked your ass so we can go out and have dinner, 
[02:23:00]  but we both know that I beat you up?  No, I don't look at it like that.  I mean...  That was really a girl's question, by the way.  I act like a chick on a date with him.  That's the fucking...  What a girl from Long Island would ask.  You shouldn't allow him to punch you now.  No, no, no.  I don't want...  I usually do stuff with the mixed martial arts guys.  They come in, I'll let them put me in a hole just to see what it feels like.  I don't think I'm tough.  But a boxer, you can't because they punch.  I'm not taking a fucking...  You don't think you're tough?  No, but I have to say that to him. 
[02:23:30]  I don't want him to think I'm...  Because already he thinks I'm an ass.  I don't want him to think I'm delusional.  Let him hit you at like 20%.  Give you a little dead arm or something.  No, no, no.  No.  No.  How about an Indian rub?  I'm heavier than he is, too.  It's embarrassing.  How...  What weight do you fight at?  I fight at about 47.  Do you know what I'm saying?  I weigh him by like 23 pounds.  Do you know how embarrassing that is?  That he could literally slap me unconscious?  Well, he's got the reach on you, too, Jim.  Yeah, I suppose so.  Thanks.  Thanks for clearing that up, Ant.  Obviously, without giving away any strategy, what is it going to take to win this fight? 
[02:24:00]  What do you think?  Is it going to be a get in there, charge, start hitting away, or take it easy, back off, let  him get tired?  Well, I mean, you look at a lot of the obvious that happened in his last fights.  And I just look at the wall of Margarito.  I mean, he beat Margarito up pretty good, but there were some interesting moments in  there where Margarito landed some good jabs.  Margarito landed some pretty good body shots. 
[02:24:30]  You know, so, I mean, there is things to look at, and some of his fights that happened  in Evil Cotto and Marquez, you know, you kind of check it out, look at the fight tapes,  and, you know, me and my coach brother, Nazem Richardson, we'll definitely go over it  and figure out some game plans for him.  When you look at those films, the fight tapes and stuff, do you notice a lot of times that  they are really doing the same thing over and over again, or do people mix it up a lot  and you go, geez, this guy's really screwing me up here, I can't get a line on what he's 
[02:25:00]  doing, or do you really kind of see a consistent, maybe an error they're making that you go,  ah, that's what I can capitalize on?  Well, sometimes you don't really call it, sometimes it's an error, sometimes it's not.  Sometimes it's just a pattern.  It's a certain pattern that they're doing, and you capitalize on that pattern.  And meanwhile, they're doing the same to you, they're looking at you and seeing if you have  a pattern that they can...  Exactly, so they're seeing how they can capitalize on the pattern.  Do you try to mix that up so it confuses people? 
[02:25:30]  Do you come out for another fight?  Now, I know you obviously have to fight the way you know how to fight, but do you try to  change a little something just to knock them off guard a little bit?  Well, sometimes, you know, that's a coach's thing to watch my patterns and see what I'm  doing the same and kind of change up a little bit.  So if I fall into that pattern, maybe I can change my pattern a little bit and throw them  off.  Oh, that would screw them.  Imagine that.  They just study the films and go, oh, I got this guy.  And then you go in, and it's like, oh, no, he changed that thing. 
[02:26:00]  Now I'm screwed.  Now I'm screwed.  When you...  A lot of fighters, it seems like, you know, you obviously are still in great fighting shape,  but a lot of guys go, like, too long.  And it seems like, what is it that causes guys?  Like, you know, like Meldrick Taylor, a lot of people talk about, and...  Opie and Anthony.  Although...  This show.  I think Ali fought for too long.  And it's like, what is it that motivates guys?  Because some of these guys still have the money.  Is it so hard to walk away from the routine? 
[02:26:30]  Walk away from all that money, I'm thinking.  Yeah, is it just the money, or is it more than that?  I'm not even sure.  Well, for some fighters, it's the money.  Some fighters fight for the money.  Some fighters fight for the love of the sport, for the fame, you know, the glory.  You know, get in the ring and hear all these, you know, the fans screaming.  Yeah, that's got to be hard to walk away from.  And probably some of these guys, when they get away from them, they see a new guy coming  up and getting all that glory and stuff.  They say, oh, you know, I can be there.  I want to come back, and I want to fight this guy. 
[02:27:00]  And no one wants to see that.  Obviously, that's probably why they hang on maybe a little longer than they should some  of these guys.  Well, maybe that's probably what happens when these guys retire, and then they come back.  And then they retire, and then they come back, because, you know, they're losing that excitement  or the scream from the crowd.  And watching other people having all that fun and excitement.  Yeah.  It's no surprise, I mean, in sports in general, athletes stay too long.  Sometimes.  You don't get a lot of guys that leave at the top of their game or slightly past the top 
[02:27:30]  of their game.  You always see the guy.  I always remember Willie Mays looking really bad in the outfield there for the Mets when  he was in his 40s, you know?  Oh, yeah.  He didn't need to play anymore.  Yeah.  And there's a lot.  I mean, there's a million guys like that.  Yeah.  In all sports.  That's rough to watch.  Have you taken time off?  Like, have you gone a certain amount of time without working?  Where you're like, you know what?  I think I'm done.  Or have you actually just consistently fought?  You know, I'm going to have to walk myself away from the game of boxing because I love  to box.  I love to go to the gym. 
[02:28:00]  I'm not the type of guy that's going to say, oh, you know, I don't want to go to the gym.  Even when I'm, you know, not fighting, if I'm not a boxer, I'm still going to be in  the boxing gym training, regardless of me fighting on TV or whatever.  You'll do an hour in the gym instead of 18 hours, you know what I mean?  Yeah.  You'll drop it down.  I just want to get back to that question again.  Do you know of a boxer that did leave at the top of his game? 
[02:28:30]  Where you knew he had a lot more fights in him, but he said, you know what?  I'm done.  And a guy we would know.  Yeah, see?  What if Marciano, he was 50-0?  I mean, did he, I mean, I don't think any of us really remember Marciano.  I just know because he was 50-0.  I think something happened to him where he had to retire.  And, Tim, you know the fight game.  You know of one fighter that might have had a few more in him and said, no, I'm going  to leave right now.  What kind of shape was Larry Holmes in when he left?  I mean, he was 49-0 at one point, and then he, I think, lost to Michael Spinks.  But then he kind of came back. 
[02:29:00]  He came back a little bit and lost to Mike Tyson.  Yeah, he came back a little bit, Larry.  Oh, God, he fought the, you know, I forgot he fought.  He did come back.  Yeah, that was a bad move.  He could have been a guy that left on top, and then he decided he got the itch and he came  back in, too.  Yeah, Mayfair, you know, the young guy, Mike Tyson.  You saw the Tyson where he goes, I don't want to do this no more.  That went after that one fight.  I forgot who it was.  It was so sad to see.  He's like, I don't want to do this anymore.  Yeah, he's like, I don't have the heart for this anymore.  He was just done fighting.  But that's the way a boxer should give it up.  Like, right after it's done, go, you know what?  I'm done with this. 
[02:29:30]  That was kind of a great public thing to say.  Like, eh.  It was an amazing moment for Tyson.  Yeah, it's weird.  It's like, I think it really humanized Tyson to people.  You know, the media only shows you a certain part.  You don't get to see the guy at home.  And do you find, like, you know, being a fighter, you're portrayed a certain way publicly  that bothers you or that you don't like?  I mean, there's certain things.  But, I mean, there's no need to bring up all the other bad stuff.  I just...  When you read the negative press, because I read it, you know, I read it. 
[02:30:00]  Like, even on Twitter, if someone badmoused, they have four followers.  It's amazing how...  I have no followers.  Yeah, I do the same thing.  Yeah, it's like, you look for someone badmouthing you and...  No, I really don't look for them badmouthing you.  I mean, just sometimes, you know, you get...  There's, you know, some good stuff, and then you get, you know, bad, good, and then, you  know, you go down about five more good ones than another bad one, and they really try  to get into your skin.  I think they get a reply back.  And then, like you say, you look at their followers as zero or four followers, and then... 
[02:30:30]  Yeah, why am I going to...  They just try to gain some more followers.  Yeah, I'm not going to get many...  Yeah, but it's amazing.  It is tempting sometimes just to write them back.  It's like you just want to sit them down in a room and scream at them and spit on them.  And it's like, why?  Sometimes I'll write a private message to them and then block them.  Oh, really?  Like, ha-ha, no one's going to see this anyway.  Click.  Real mature.  Yeah.  I try to keep it real mature.  What an ass I am.  Marvin Hagler, they're saying, was a guy that might have left on top. 
[02:31:00]  Oh, yeah?  Oh, he...  Yeah, he left on...  Well, not all the way on top.  He lost to Sugar Ray Leonard, I think, and it was close fight.  He thought he won.  Right.  And he said, you know what?  I'm done with this.  I'm not going to come back anymore.  So he got angry with the system.  And I apologize.  I don't know this guy.  Joe Calzaki.  Oh, yeah.  Joe Calzaki.  He was 46-0 and he retired?  Yes, yes.  He did.  He also retired on top.  But, you know, I'm not sure if they was talking about him coming back and fighting again. 
[02:31:30]  Why did he decide to leave?  You know, I really don't know.  I mean, there's...  I'm going to have to look this stuff up after the show.  I'm kind of obsessed with this now.  There's probably some, you know, there's probably his own reasons.  Yeah.  Okay.  When you're training for a fight...  Several guys in Europe.  Oh, wait a minute.  Several guys in Europe.  Give them the mic, eh?  What's your name, sir?  Brother Nazem.  Brother Nazem, hello?  You're not going to hurt us, are you?  No, sir.  He's a very serious man, though.  A very serious guy.  He's a man of peace.  Sitting back in and enjoying the show. 
[02:32:00]  Sugar.  Sugar, he's a scary dude.  There's several guys in Europe that have done it.  There's a guy out of Berlin, Sven Aki.  He retired undefeated.  And Joe Calzaki retired undefeated.  Although, like Shane was saying, he caught, like, Roy Jones and Bernard Hopkins at the end  of his career, and then he left the game undefeated.  And there was an athlete that was a bandwagon named Galaxian who never lost a fight.  Wow.  But Roberto, the one I think of as Ricardo Lopez, to me, who was one of my favorite fighters 
[02:32:30]  in history, he never lost an amateur fight or a professional fight.  Wow.  To never lose amateurs, because even when Tyson was undefeated, I think he didn't lose to  Holyfield as an amateur.  Everyone loses an amateur.  Henry Tubman he lost to.  Henry Tubman went to the Olympics.  Oh, that was when Tyson lost to?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Do you fight, or are you a trainer?  I'm a trainer.  He's my trainer.  Oh, he's a trainer.  Okay.  That's why he knows what he's talking about.  I would hope so.  What would you say, I'll ask both of you guys this.  What would you say is, if you could watch any fight, if you had one more fight to watch 
[02:33:00]  before you died, a fight that had gone on that you'd seen many times, what fight would  you choose to watch?  Like, just the boxing match that you love to see, that you've already seen.  The one that I liked was the one with Sugar Ray Leonard and Tommy Hearns, the three-rounder.  Well, that's Hagler.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  Hagler, Hagler and Hearns.  Hagler and Hearns.  Yeah, the three-rounder.  That was a fascinating fight.  That was a real, I guess, one of the best three-rounds ever in history.  And how about yourself? 
[02:33:30]  A favorite fight to pick up.  It's hard for me to call.  I have so many.  It's ridiculous.  You have Larry Holmes and Ken Norton.  Oh, man.  That was a slugfest.  You have George Foreman and Ron Lyle.  Oh, right.  There's so many, it's hard to go back on.  Wasn't that after Ali had beaten him, Foreman Lyle, or was it earlier?  It was after.  You see, I just gave him both options, by the way.  I literally asked you a question that I couldn't be wrong on.  I'm like, was that before or after?  So it's one of the two, so I kind of sound like I know what I'm talking about. 
[02:34:00]  I really am phony.  But that's how you ask a question and sound like you know what you're talking about.  Well, that was either a yes or a no, correct?  Yes.  All right.  What I just saw, they're showing on Classic Fight, I just watched it, and you know, one  of the best combinations I've ever seen thrown, and you know, it's only 75 years ago, was  Joe Lewis knocking out Billy Kahn in that second, in the second fight.  Jesus Christ, what a combo that is.  Yeah.  It doesn't help this discussion at all.  I just figured I'd throw that out.  I was on the elliptical and I happened to say it. 
[02:34:30]  We got no...  That's a great fight in history.  Great fight in history.  Because Billy Kahn said, Joe, he said, you could have let me win the fight, and then  you could have came back and beat me in the rematch.  Joe said, you had the title for 13 rounds.  How could I be sure you keep it any longer than that?  All right.  Because he was beating Joe, and then Joe came back and beat him.  Hey, we got a question coming in from Nolan, Massachusetts.  You don't have to put the headphones on, Shane, but just put them near your ear so you can  hear what he has to say.  Noel, what's going on?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  Can you hear?  Okay.  Hey, how's it going, Shane? 
[02:35:00]  How you doing?  Good, good.  Hey, Nassim training you for this fight?  Because he had the perfect game plan for the Floyd Mayweather fight, so I'm just wondering  if he's training you?  Yeah, yeah.  He's definitely going to be training you for this fight, yes.  Okay, okay.  Well, I got another question.  You were picked to fight Pacquiao.  You say Bob Arum is a good friend and all of that.  In boxing, there's not a lot of fighters out there people know.  Do you think that you being picked to fight Manny, seeing you've lost, I think, maybe three 
[02:35:30]  out of your last four, maybe two out of your last three, the Mayweather fight being a pretty  bad loss.  You have a great game plan.  You have the guy.  He turned into a dragon, and you could have stepped on the tail, right?  Okay.  All right, there's guys like Andre Berto out there, very fast, undefeated, ranked pretty  high up there.  Do you think you being picked, just like Margarito, Cotto also coming off of a loss, 
[02:36:00]  Clotty, who came off a loss, every opponent Pacquiao has faced him after being defeated  pretty bad.  Do you think that's ruining boxing?  Do you think you were ham-picked?  No, I wouldn't actually, I wouldn't, sorry, you're asking him a hundred questions, let  him answer one, and you can, that's all right.  Okay, can I ask you, can I ask you, can I ask you, can I ask you, can I ask you, can  I ask you a question?  Sorry, you're panicking.  Sir, sir.  Can I, can I, can I ask you a question?  Can I ask you a question?  Do you actually think that Berto will beat me? 
[02:36:30]  Who?  Andre Berto, do you think he can, you know, do you think he can beat me?  No, no, no, I think, I think.  Do you, do you think that, do you think that Margarito, Juan Manuel Marquez can beat me?  Absolutely not.  Okay, now, how big, are the names, do they have a, do they have a big, do they have a  big name, or, how many people know, how many people know Andre Berto?  How many, I know, I'm just asking you a question, I'm asking you a question back, how many people  know Andre Berto?  Is he a household name?  A lot of people in boxing know Berto. 
[02:37:00]  In boxing, in boxing, in boxing, in boxing, but outside of boxing, how many people know  Andre Berto?  I know, I hear you, but what I'm saying is, do you think that's ruining boxing?  Nah, I wouldn't say, I wouldn't say it's ruining boxing, I'd say it's helping out boxing,  because CBS, and these people following me around, I'm a household name, they know me.  People, people know me, so I'm actually, I'm actually helping the boxing, boxing out.  So after this fight, after this fight, when Berto, actually, Berto, or whoever else, when 
[02:37:30]  he fights a top guy, then he's able to be pushed into that, like me, you know, I was  knocking out everybody, I was, I don't know, 38, no, 35 knockouts, I knocked out everybody,  but Oscar gave me that chance, and when I fought Oscar De La Hoya, then I became a big  household name.  Until then, I didn't have any big fights.  I know, you gotta knock the fuck out!  Yeah, but you know what though, Shane, after you did fight De La Hoya, you went on to try 
[02:38:00]  and make history, you faced Winky Wright twice.  These were fights that were really tough for you to win.  And until I fought Winky, nobody knew who Winky was, so I gave Winky his opportunity.  Well, you're right, you're right about that too, but what I mean is, do you think boxing  is going, it's kind of disappearing?  Sir, can I, not to interrupt you, sir, while you're on a, while you're giving a speech,  but the beautiful thing about, I'm watching Shane, and he's such a nice guy, but during  that discussion, his body posture, you should, you're really lucky that you're not in the 
[02:38:30]  studio.  It's fun to watch a guy, like when you hit a certain spot that really annoys him, and  he's really nice, but it's like you forget, like, oh yeah, he fights for a living, and  that body posture changed.  Thank you for calling, I mean, obviously no boxing, but no, I, I, and I'm not, I'm confused,  because he said he was a fan of Shane's, I'm sure he is, but he might, a lot of people  say, I'm on Twitter, and, you know, they, they disrespect me, they call me all kind of  names, and then after I replied to him, it's like, oh, I'm a, I'm a, I'm one of your biggest  fans, I'm like, you are? 
[02:39:00]  Like, how are you my fan?  Oh, that guy was ludicrous.  Are you SugarShaneM on Twitter?  Yeah, at SugarShaneM, so follow me, I definitely reply back all the time.  I just tweeted a picture of you there, so, I used your Twitter name, so now you get a few  followers from us, that's how that shit works.  That's cool.  We got to get him out of here, everyone, I guess you get a lot of interviews or something?  Probably a busy day.  All right, let me plug the fight then, obviously, it's, it's a, it's a huge fight, and it is  good for boxing, because there really are not as many names as big as you and Pacquiao.  Mayweather Pacquiao's a big fight, but my opinion is that Mayweather's ducking him, and if 
[02:39:30]  Floyd was sitting here, I wouldn't say that.  I'd be like, ah, Shane's afraid of you, you know, because, you know, I'm a person, that's  what I do.  May 7th at the MGM Grand Arena in Las Vegas, 9 o'clock on Showtime Pay-Per-View, it is,  I'm not going to say it the way they have it written, I'm going to say Mosley vs. Pacquiao,  and, you know, it's going to be a great fight, and I wish you a lot of luck, I mean, you're  a nice guy.  Even, we took a photo together one time, I bothered him.  Oh, here it goes, let me see.  Let's see the picture.  Let's see the picture.  This is also a great picture of body language, because look at me trying to put my arm around 
[02:40:00]  Shane, and he wants nothing to do with me.  It really is, it's like you're hugging a disease, and I don't blame you.  He was.  All right, so, you're great, man, and I'm happy that you're obviously ready to fight,  and I wish you a lot of luck.  Thank you, I appreciate it.  Thank you, Shane.  Thanks, man.  All right.  Sirius XM, the virus.  Yeah, this is the O.P. Anthony Show.  Damn it.  We got Vinnie Paul and Josh Todd coming in studio in a few minutes here, Anthony. 
[02:40:30]  Yes, we do.  Really quickly, I want to talk about Harry.  Good old Harry.  I don't know about this.  You know about this one, right, Ann?  Yes, I saw.  Harry Balls?  I saw this last night.  Holy shit.  It seems that they're trying to name some kind of a city building, and I don't exactly know  what town this is in.  And I think they say it in the news clip.  But they want to name it after a famous mayor, an ex-mayor. 
[02:41:00]  Nice.  Mayor.  But his name is a little awkward.  And even though it's winning in votes, the name, they're not sure if they're going to  name this place after this former mayor, because it is a little embarrassing.  What is up with embarrassing names?  Why do we have embarrassing names?  I think people have pride in their last names and don't change them and shit like that. 
[02:41:30]  But if your name's Harry Balls.  Yeah, well.  Yeah, maybe you should.  I don't know.  Here's the clip.  Fort Wayne's longest-serving mayor has put our fair city back on the map.  Even GPSs are taking cracks at Fort Wayne.  We're calculating.  Continue point four miles.  Then turn right on North Harry Balls Drive.  There's already a street named after former Mayor Harry Balls, and it appears through online  voting, the community is ready to name a second thing after him. 
[02:42:00]  There is someone standing up for the thousands of votes, Balls' great-nephew, who now goes  by Bales.  Bales.  You just read the name and you're not sure.  You might say Balls, you might say Bales.  What do you think about all this?  Oh, I think it's kind of funny.  I also think this is a name the people have voted for.  I think the people should have their say.  On Monday, Fort Wayne Deputy Mayor Beth Malloy told the Journal-Gazette naming the new  city-county building, the Harry Balls Government Center, was, quote, probably not going  to happen.  Since it's Uncle Harry, it should be Balls. 
[02:42:30]  They can do it, like you said, with the street name, H.W., instead of his entire name.  I don't see a problem with it.  Online voting at feedbackfortwayne.org ends Friday.  Well, you know it's just going to get, like, crazy fucking votes now for Harry Balls.  Poor Harry Balls.  Harry Balls.  Great mayor, but they can't use his name ever.  Although they have the street name.  And to hear the GPS say Harry Balls is pretty funny.  You know what the worst is, the second place is, hey, would you blow me, is a famous governor. 
[02:43:00]  Mike Hunt is on his way up, too.  Yeah, they're going to name a library after Mike Hunt.  Is, really, is that the Dickazinia Center?  Is that going to be erected soon?  The Dickazinia?  It's a great story.  What do you do?  What do you do?  I guess you use the initials.  If he's such a great guy.  Yeah.  The H.W. building, or whatever they wanted to call it. 
[02:43:30]  That's great.  I was just going to run to the Phil McCracken Mall over there and see if I can buy myself an iPhone.  Poor Harry.  Harry Balls.  And then they try to change it to Bales.  Right.  See, the spelling is B-A-A-L-S.  That's the spelling.  And apparently the family's grandmother, like this guy that was talking, his grandmother.  Mispronounced it.  No, changed it on purpose. 
[02:44:00]  Because that's when it started turning into, like, Balls started becoming synonymous with testicles.  And before that, they were talking, it wasn't a thing.  Like, when this mayor was Mayor, Mayor Harry Balls, Balls wasn't something they called testicles.  Is that a...  Yeah, it wasn't, like, synonymous with testicles.  What about the hairy part?  The hairy part is just his name.  Hairy.  A hairy.  Hairy Balls.  But then it became, like, testicles, and it became very funny. 
[02:44:30]  Of course.  And very insulting.  And then they went to Bales.  Bales.  Which, you know, you're still going to look and just go, ah, stop.  That's a great clip, though.  I need more clips on this story.  Yeah, Grandma Balls said she doesn't want that.  I need new stories.  There's a lot more news stories.  More hairy balls.  Yeah.  News stories on this.  More of them.  I heard a different one last night.  It was the same news.  But he said hairy balls more, right? 
[02:45:00]  Oh, yeah.  He said a lot more.  He just kept saying he couldn't get hairy balls out of his mouth fast enough.  It's amazing.  Hairy balls.  Hey, let's get Vinnie Paul and Josh Todd in studio.  They're doing the Jägermeister tour, man.  Buck Cherry and Hell Yeah.  Jägermeister.  Do we have more tickets to give away to this thing?  Uh, yeah.  Fucking hey.  Vinnie Paul is stupid, buddy.  What's up, Vinnie?  How you doing, man?  What's going on?  And they put Josh over there.  What happened to Josh? 
[02:45:30]  Hey, Josh.  Over in that one.  Cool.  What's going on, man?  What's going on, man?  What's going on, man?  What's going on, man?  How you doing?  Good, good.  Good.  You know how it is.  Fucking.  I don't think we've ever talked to Vinnie Paul.  We've talked to Josh before.  It's possible.  I'm trying to think.  I think we have.  Maybe at AF.  I think so.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think we have talked about it for many years, man.  Massachusetts.  I met Vinnie very briefly backstage at an Eddie Trunk event.  It was, uh...  Not brief enough for him, I bet. 
[02:46:00]  Believe me, he wasn't happy.  But it was, uh...  But no, he, uh...  It was funny.  It was the first time I've ever been recognized for Meet the Creeps.  That's right.  Meet the Creeps.  Oh, really?  Amazing.  I love it.  Yeah, man.  Goddamn.  That's pretty cool.  And he knew Kenny.  You recognized Kenny, of course, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Big dolt outside.  Big Kenny.  Good stuff, man.  Is he as unpleasant in person as you expected him to be?  No.  No?  He's a little better?  He is.  Please.  It's all good.  It's all good.  These guys live a fucking great life.  Somebody outside, I don't know who it was, smells a little like liquor. 
[02:46:30]  I don't want to say anybody's been drinking in the morning.  Probably me.  Probably Vinny.  When you live in the lifestyle, 9.30 is like nighttime.  This feels like...  It's still last night.  That's awesome.  7 a.m., trust me.  This is early for us, man.  Yeah, this is stupid early, right?  Stupid early, yeah.  But it's good.  I can't stand that shit.  I gotta do it every day.  You're a drummer.  For a singer, it's gotta be a little bit more...  Are you more protective of your voice, or do you just go out and get loaded and you  don't give a shit?  No, I don't get loaded.  Oh, you don't?  No.  He leaves it to me. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, I've been sober 16 years.  Oh, okay.  That was a good question.  Yeah, me too.  I'm sober.  No, I'm sober for a long time, too.  I just didn't know you were.  Cool, yeah.  Did your friends for a while tell you, like, look, man, you're fucking missing out?  And then...  I lost all my friends.  Oh.  Really.  I had to get all new friends.  Ah, yeah.  Sure.  One of those deals, yeah.  They were all probably bad influence, huh?  Did you...  You know, we just all got really messed up, you know?  Did you replace it with something good?  Because some people replace it with something bad.  Uh, well, I went through, uh, you know, caffeine, sugar, sex, all the usual... 
[02:47:30]  Right, right.  ...legal stuff.  Yeah.  I know.  Although, being a rock star, it's got to be a lot easier to make the sex happen.  Let me hand this out.  What is it?  Let's just hand Jaeger, Mike.  Jaeger.  Oh, right.  On the Jaeger tour.  As Josh is talking about being sober for 16 years.  You drink Jaeger?  Of course you do, right, Vinny?  Yeah.  I've had plenty of it, yeah.  I'm surrounded by sober people, man.  Yeah, yeah.  Hopefully I don't annoy you guys.  No, no, no.  But, you know, I stopped drinking last night.  2.30 a.m., so...  It'll be on again tonight at the Nokia Theater.  Do you love...  What do they call it, please, now?  Best Buy? 
[02:48:00]  Uh, Best Buy, yeah.  Yeah, it's the Best Buy now.  Yeah.  The names change now.  It is.  Every fucking month.  You go there, and you play there, and you come back, and you go, oh, I remember that place.  And then they change the name of it on you, and you think you're going to a different  place, and it's the same place.  Yeah.  Out of business arena.  Another shitty bank name on top of it.  I think I write, who wants to go to the fucking Fleet Center?  It's not fun.  What's the one in Florida?  It's a lawyer's name.  It's 1-800-CALL-EDDY Theater.  Oh, right, right.  He's not lying, though.  It's something like that.  It's the worst one. 
[02:48:30]  It's one of those ambulance chaser lawyers, and they named the amphitheater after him.  The bank names are bad enough, but yeah, that takes us to a whole other level, man.  What balls to name it?  1-800-CALL-EDDY.  Or something like that.  Yeah, I can't remember exactly what it is, but it's something like that.  Yeah, Vinny's right, though, man.  So, dude, when you quit drinking, what made you quit?  Like, for me, it was just a bunch of bad nights, but I mean, I imagine for you, you  were in the life already, right?  Yeah, a lot of things.  You know, I was doing a lot of crystal meth at the time.  I never did that.  Did you snort that, or were you... 
[02:49:00]  I snorted it, yeah, but, you know, it was like that coupled with a major alcohol problem,  you know, so I started getting alcohol poisoning and just bad at, like, 23, so it was brutal.  Did you ever puke on stage?  I was three years sober before I started doing stand-up.  I was amazed by guys who can perform fucking loaded.  Oh, yeah.  Thank you.  I never puked on stage.  No?  No.  So you went crazy with the sex, though, when you got sober?  I know I certainly did.  I was, yeah.  I went through a period of that, yeah.  Yeah, I'm still in it.  February of 87, and I still can't stop paying for blowjobs. 
[02:49:30]  It's amazing how much...  Nice.  That's a brutal addiction.  Sex is a rough one.  Yeah, but, you know, a blowjob is a good thing, you know.  No, it really is.  I mean, it's a beautiful thing.  It's not going to hurt you.  What's that?  It's not going to hurt you.  That's when you start getting into men.  Well, you know, it's funny you say that.  I'm not into men at all.  I mean, we've all made the occasional tranny.  I mean, it's like, it's only a good gentleman's fault that occasionally a young man in a dress  will look like a lady in a dress, and there's no refund policy. 
[02:50:00]  What are you going to do?  Fucking waste your money or get blown?  Come on.  What are we, men?  Let's go.  Right, everyone?  Jesus, to your fucking mind.  Sorry, honey, that you had to hear that.  I apologize.  No telling what we're going to hear in here today.  No one ever knows.  And it's Ask Gary, just for the people that are obsessed with having the real name.  It's 1-800-ASK-GARY.  See, I was close.  It's the name of the arena down there in Florida.  There you go.  There we go.  That's horrible.  Thanks, man.  That's absolutely horrible.  No one else wanted to fess up a few bucks and actually get the name?  I don't know. 
[02:50:30]  I guess he had the cash.  He had the cash.  And now he's got the customers.  Think of how many people leave there drunk, as we talked about.  They get in a car wreck or get pulled over.  What's the first thing that comes to their mind?  1-800-CALL-GARY.  That ain't bad.  I guess you're right.  It seems like this tour's been going on forever.  How long have you guys been on the road?  I think about six weeks.  That's it?  I thought Florentine did a run with Slayer and Megadeth and Anthrax, I think.  So what, are they switching out bands? 
[02:51:00]  No, no, no.  This is the Jaeger tour, but they have different legs of it.  Okay.  So, yeah, he was out on that.  Actually, with Hell Yeah, we've been out since April last year, so we've had three weeks off.  We've been to Europe, Australia, Japan, all over the place.  We're about to head back.  We're going to be doing the Philippines and Thailand, which we've never done before, and  keep this thing rolling until the end of the summer, hopefully.  Have you guys ever, Florentine amazed me when he did that.  He's like, I'm doing these gigs with Slayer.  I'm like, what the fuck's the matter with you?  What a ballsy move for a comic. 
[02:51:30]  Like, have you ever had a comic go on?  I did music one or two times in my career in 20 years.  Horrendous.  I did not do well.  I'm like, I can't do it.  It's scary.  Yeah.  He held his own on that.  I heard some of the audio from that.  He came to our show in Jersey a couple nights ago, so it was good to see him.  He's a good guy.  Dude, between Megadeth and Slayer, he had to actually perform from the sound booth because  Slayer had the curtain closed, and so there was no room for him on stage, so he's doing  his third set in front of the same audience, and they're a little drunker by this point, 
[02:52:00]  at the fucking sound booth.  He's like, fucking shots were flying at him.  Oh, I don't doubt it.  The Jaeger girls were crying because shit was getting thrown at him, which is kind of  satisfying.  Makes you a little tougher, though, huh?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Florentine doesn't need toughening up, but whatever.  Hey, we were talking about the Grammys earlier in the rock category, and how rock music right  now is almost non-existent.  And obviously, Buck Sherry is definitely doing it, and hell yeah, but what's your take on  that whole thing?  It's all faggy.  And the music that's out right now that they say is in the rock category? 
[02:52:30]  Well, you know, I thought Muse was a good pick, at least out of all those, but the candidates  were just like, wow.  It was terrible.  But, you know, I try to look for just good performances, and I really liked CeeLo.  I really liked the girls at the beginning who did the Aretha tribute.  That was really cool.  But the guys like you, though, it seems like what rock turned into, or a lot of harder  rock, it seemed like it was a bunch of quote-unquote healthier people just trying to be smarter  than the audience and give messages. 
[02:53:00]  It's like they just, they don't, I hate to say it, but they don't kick ass.  A lot of these guys are just fucking, you know, they're fruity, and it's fucking annoying.  It looks like recycled, early 80s new wave brought into now with, like, this just pussiness  behind it.  Everybody's scared.  Yeah, yeah.  There's a lot of PC bands these days.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All that shit.  Yeah.  Androgynous fucking PC fruits.  Well, you know, a lot of these, a lot of these new school kids are, like, asexual. 
[02:53:30]  They're weird.  You know, they're just not into, like, you know, expressing themselves like that.  You know, it's weird.  You guys must fucking hate that.  I mean, I can't stand them.  I don't blame you.  I mean, Vinny, you obviously, I've never been to your establishment, but you did invite  me, which I thought was very nice.  Vinny, you went to a strip club.  You're welcome anytime.  Several.  Oh, several?  Yeah.  In Dallas, right?  All in Dallas?  Nope.  I own some in Las Vegas and also in Austin, Texas.  A strip club mogul.  Fuck, I was just in Austin.  A strip club mogul.  Yeah, hell yeah.  It's good business, man. 
[02:54:00]  Damn, hell yeah.  Sex sells, right?  What are they called?  The clubhouse in Dallas, Texas.  And then I own a string of Latino strip establishments known as Chicas Bonitas.  I like that.  I have one in Las Vegas, one in Fort Worth, one in Austin.  I'm about to put one in Tucson and one in Phoenix.  Who gets the metal detector?  Well, dude, they're really surprisingly violence-free.  We're the number one Corona seller in all of Las Vegas.  Really?  It's pretty amazing.  It's a good business to be in.  So you don't need the money to go out on these gigs.  You just like doing it. 
[02:54:30]  I just love playing music, man.  Honestly.  I mean, there ain't a whole lot of money to be made out here these days, man.  So, you know, I really, really enjoy coming out and playing.  Fuck, man.  I didn't know you had one strip club in Dallas.  Florentine's like, you gotta go.  I thought I started doing it.  Bang, strippers.  I'm like, all right, I'd love to go to Dallas.  We were invited to the Dallas one a few times over the years.  The clubhouse is very, very famous.  Where did we eat in Dallas?  We went to the Lodge.  The Lodge.  Oh, the Lodge.  It's not far from us.  Shame on you guys.  We didn't know back then.  That's years ago.  That's all good.  Well, next time you're back in Big D, you gotta come see us at the clubhouse. 
[02:55:00]  They have nice steaks at the Lodge.  Oh, they do have good steaks.  The food was good, too.  Yeah, they do.  Yeah, but I think I have more fun at Vinny's place.  Of course.  You don't have to have a steak, but, you know, I imagine that the girls are probably a little  better, you know.  They're totally new, too, so you get the whole package.  That's great, man.  And it's bring your own booze, too, so you're not like in there getting $15, $20 a shot.  Not literally.  You know, figuratively fucked here in New York.  It's, uh...  They keep their friggin' panties on. 
[02:55:30]  It's like, what's the difference?  We're all in here for one thing.  Exactly.  If their balls can't flop out, what's the use?  But, uh...  Well, the nude thing is probably the same in Dallas.  It's like, you can't have liquor with nudity, um...  Yeah, you gotta bring your own bottle.  Yeah, you gotta bring your own.  But that's good for the customer, man.  You walk in with a $20 bottle, and you can get waxed.  Oh, yeah.  But if you're buying, you're gonna spend $100, $150 on drinks.  That's money you could spend on the girls, man.  Yeah, you spend the money on the girls.  And there's a $20 cover, right?  That's how you make the money, from the covers.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:56:00]  And it's totally nude, so that's fuckin' the shit.  I used to perform in a place like that, uh, called the Boxcar in New Jersey, which...  I like the name of that, Boxcar.  It was fuckin'...  You've never seen anybody steal material like I did.  I was, like, 1993.  And then, you know, Florentine did them, Otto and George and Levy.  One pole dancing?  Dude, it was fuckin'...  They would literally be given lap dances while you were performing.  There were biker gangs in there.  It was horrendous.  And me and my little fuckin'...  My purple baggy workout pants.  Oh, little jizz bucket.  It was really bad.  I love that.  I love that.  Yeah, I love the girls, though.  But that's why the bouncers liked it, because they were sick of the chicks babbling. 
[02:56:30]  They were talking at them about nothing, so they wanted comedians in there.  But the customers didn't feel the same way about being sick of the chicks.  No.  Why am I talking so much?  I apologize.  I flew in last night.  I'm fuckin' exhausted.  I'm on no sleep.  I'm tired today.  I'm just babbling.  Sorry.  You could tell.  Fuckin' all good, man.  How have the shows been, though?  Great?  Yeah.  Awesome, man.  Yeah.  Really, really good, man.  That's the shit.  Just get a bunch of maniacs out there.  A bunch of them, man.  Yeah.  It starts early.  I mean, there's five bands every night, and it's a very great, diverse package. 
[02:57:00]  A lot of different kind of music.  All the bands getting along or anything?  Yeah, man.  We all get on great.  No squabbles?  No squabbles.  Nah.  Nah.  Because I know bands, you know, sometimes, eh.  Sometimes someone's an asshole.  Every now and then that kind of stuff happens.  I want to ask you about overseas, when you're playing in these crazy places like Thailand  and stuff, and they actually know your music?  Yeah, pretty much, man.  Do you find that strange, when you're that far from home?  I think it's just music's the international language, man.  You know, it doesn't matter whether they can understand what's coming out of Josh's mouth 
[02:57:30]  or what.  They feel the music, they feel the vibe, and they really, really get into it, man.  Is there one place that either one of you guys have played, and you were just amazed  how much they're into your band?  Like, Japan, you know.  I was going to say Japan.  I love Japan.  Japan, they actually learn English through rock and roll, listening to rock and roll.  So weird.  That's why they really love 80s rock, because of that, because it's a lot of rock and roll  anthems and big, you know, choruses and stuff.  Big chanting choruses.  They love that, you know, so...  That is so weird. 
[02:58:00]  It's cool.  They're just learning English through the music.  Yeah, and they really get into your whole career, you know.  Every nook and cranny, they bring you gifts, and it's really bizarre.  Do they sit, though?  They used to sit in Japan.  I know the bands would go over there, and, like, I think the 70s, I think someone in  Kiss said it, they would actually sit and politely watch the show.  And that meant they were really enjoying the show.  Yeah, that went away.  Oh, it did?  It went away, and now they're like, fuck that?  Yeah, it used to be the same thing, too.  When you finished playing, they would clap real loud real fast, and then it would get  quiet.  Oh, wow.  You ever play China?  So weird. 
[02:58:30]  Nope, but playing in Taiwan, coming up in May.  It's really crazy.  We're doing the string of festivals in Europe, not Europe, Asia.  We're doing Taiwan, the Philippines, and Japan with Anthrax.  And the ones in Taiwan and Philippines, it's been going for about two years now, and it's  30,000 to 40,000 people, and it's a $7 ticket.  You get two beers and a hot dog with it.  Get the fuck out of here.  You get three American bands and then like 28 Taiwanese bands or whatever.  Sounds like old school.  It's crazy, though. 
[02:59:00]  But a $7 ticket, two beers, and a hot dog, how cool is that?  Yeah, it's like there won't be any farts in that arena.  Jesus.  Wow, damn, that is something.  You guys got to get a lot of shots from going all over the world?  Do you guys get inoculations and stuff?  No, no, no, not those kind of shots.  I don't know about Josh, but alcohol is a pretty good defense.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.  It kills just about everything, including yourself at some point.  Obviously for you, Vinny, do you drink any weird shots around the world? 
[02:59:30]  Because I used to love that show, I forgot the name of it, like Three Sheets or something.  The guy would just travel around the world getting fucked up.  And there's some fucking weird shit out there you could get drunk on.  It doesn't get any weirder than a worm being in a bottle of tequila, if you ask me, man.  That's kind of true, yeah.  I never, never.  No, you don't have a story.  I understood that.  Not a great story, man.  They got snakes in jars with their alcohol and all kinds of crap.  Yeah, I'm not going to try that.  That went nowhere. 
[03:00:00]  And Australia.  Australia is awesome.  Yeah, is that cool for a...  I call it one big Texas, man.  Really?  People are super, super friendly.  They love to drink.  They love the music.  There's six girls, every guy down there.  It's a beautiful place, man.  It sounds like it's amazing.  Really?  They got bars there that actually have troughs on the ground and you just stand there and  piss whenever you need to take a leak and you just keep drinking.  That's fantastic.  Come on.  They seriously do, man.  That's brilliant.  That is the best.  Because the guy...  Those people get whacked.  Health coach, smelt coach. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah, what a horrible place to drop your contact lens.  That's brilliant because the guys at the bar are usually the ones really fucking, you  know, spending.  Yeah.  So why lose your spot at the bar because you have to take a drink, you know, go take a  leak.  It's a great opportunity to expose yourself, too, in public.  Yeah, I think it's fantastic.  Yeah, that would be great just to take your dick out at the bar.  That's a period.  There's nothing coming after that.  I just say that and raise my cup.  That could be a pickup line.  I was with Jimmy once when he did just that. 
[03:01:00]  Oh, yeah.  There was no urinal under the bar, either.  And then he blew his load on one of our kegs.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Fucking asshole.  You know how it is when you start on a radio show, you want to make an impression.  This is like 2000.  Oh, God.  I love that.  We were in that dumb bus tour that we came up with one day where we were just touring  around getting drunk on a bus broadcasting live and we're at the bar.  Was it just your ball bag?  I don't remember.  No, it was my whole dick.  Your whole dick.  I'm glad I obviously made a horrible impression.  Was that your finger?  No, it was my dick and balls and legs.  And we're talking to girls at the bar and we're trying to figure out how long it's going  to take for them to notice that his whole dick is out of his pants. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah, I didn't understand about sexual assault.  He was pressing up on her jeans.  I don't know what you want to say.  No, I don't care.  Please.  I don't even remember.  I just kind of was resting my dick on her jeans and talking to her.  No idea.  Yeah.  And then I got blown by maybe a three in the fucking bus and I arced it on the top of  the keg.  Yeah, we were drinking out of them.  Yeah.  See, guys, we're rock stars, too.  The ice in there was being used for drinks, so you really fucked everybody up that time.  I know, but again, when you're sober, you know how it is, and everybody's drinking, you  really want to just throw a little passive-aggressive joke out. 
[03:02:00]  Try cumming on the keg.  That'll fucking stop the party in its tracks.  Cumming is great.  Yes, of course.  That should be on a bumper sticker and a mug.  That'd be a fucking hat that I would wear.  Cumming is great.  The end.  Do you bang the strippers?  That's a great question.  Do I?  Have I?  Let's say have you, yeah.  You know, generally, not any of them that work for me.  Right.  Okay, yeah.  It's not good to do that.  It leads to trouble in the house.  But, you know, out on the road, back in the day, for sure, all the time, and you never 
[03:02:30]  know what happens.  We can't give all the details away.  No.  I've moved on to Hooters chicks, man.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  They're not as crazy, man.  Crazy bitch.  I don't know how you deal with that.  Yeah, you're running strip clubs.  All strippers, they're crazy bitches.  You're basically running an insane asylum for women.  Yeah, yeah.  Trust me.  So, the shit you gotta put up with. 
[03:03:00]  I don't think there's one, like, stable one I've ever bumped into.  There's probably not.  Yeah, even the ones that are like, yeah, I'm going to school right now.  Those are the craziest ones, dude.  Shut up.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And they do the honest things, that little cover-up they do when the music stops.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  What do you care?  There's no music playing.  You gotta fucking cover-up.  Well, they're not getting paid at that point.  Oh, is that it?  That's what it is.  Yeah, great.  And then I love the, you don't see this as much, the old rug act.  The rug act?  Where they'd foof out the little sheet or the little bedspread from their bed. 
[03:03:30]  That's been gone for a long time.  And they'd just pick out a slow ballad and just start spreading their legs right in front  of the bar and flipping their legs around.  I don't think I've ever seen that.  It's a lost art.  Oh, yeah.  It's a lost art, man.  A lot of podunk towns used to have that kind of stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  It was the old, just, the old townie strip club.  Not like your main fucking, before they actually, there were lap dances.  Like it was just chicks walking on the bar and you'd give them a buck and, you know,  cover up your beer when they walked by. 
[03:04:00]  Well, they actually got a place in Grand Rapids where the girls bring their own little bar  with them and then they sit it down in front of you and get on top of it and dance.  And it's only a dollar a dance.  It's crazy.  Wow.  Holy shit, their own little bar.  They do.  They carry this thing around with them, dude.  And they can't dance unless they're on top of this thing.  It's a state law or city law or something.  That's hysterical.  Come on.  That's great.  Oh, you dumb laws.  Let's go to the phones.  We got Uncle Luke from Los Angeles.  Uncle Luke.  How you doing?  Hey, what up, boys?  Hey, Vinny Pau, man. 
[03:04:30]  Hold on.  Vinny's putting his headphones on.  Hold on.  He can't hear you.  Let's see what we got here.  All right.  Go ahead, Uncle Luke.  Hey, brother.  Hey, man.  Have you made any headway with Pantano show yet, man?  You guys like cool yet?  Are you going to make some more music ever?  That's a negatory.  Next question.  Oh, man.  That's it for you, pally.  That's a quick answer on that.  That's an easy answer.  Yeah.  So you're still angry?  Or are you beyond angry and just done?  It's not angry.  It's just I have my own personal reasons, and I'm just not interested in dealing with him. 
[03:05:00]  Yeah.  It seems like in a band, I heard Paul Stanley one time say in an interview, and I mean,  it's so simple, but it's obvious.  He's like, a band is a four-way marriage when there's four people.  It's like a two-way marriage is hard enough.  And to deal with four guys, everyone growing in different directions and having different  artists.  Did you guys ever have artistic differences, or was it just sometimes?  Not really.  Just, you know, there's a lot of really deep circumstances that went on towards the end  of it, and I'm not going to get into it, but it's better left like it is, man.  I'm happy doing what I do, and that's all I really focus on. 
[03:05:30]  What was your first, this is kind of a childlike question, but what was, because I like meeting  people who I like, what was your first gig with a band that you loved?  Because I think I saw you guys on OzFest years ago.  I don't know if it was Sabbath was the headline or Ozzy, but what was the first one that you  were like, fuck me, we're working with guys that we love?  You know, the first tour we ever got.  You know, we played with Suicidal Tendencies and Exodus, and that was a kill or be killed  tour.  You know, they were the heaviest bands in the world at the time, and so we had to go out  and balls out everywhere, and it was really good for us.  But, you know, I'd always dreamed of playing with Kiss.  I got to play with Kiss.  What year did you play with Kiss? 
[03:06:00]  1998.  I got a great story.  We did their whole Kiss reunion tour down in South America, and we did three nights in  Mexico City, and then we were flying from Mexico City to, let me think about this, Chile, Santiago,  and it was my birthday, and of course, all the Kiss guys were in first class, and we were  in business class, and they came back and sang happy birthday to me in four-part harmony,  gave me the Kiss tree book, all autographed by all of them.  I felt like a 14-year-old kid, man.  I had tears coming out of my eyes.  I was like, these are my idols, Kiss.  I grew up listening to them, and here we are, not only playing with them, but they 
[03:06:30]  just sang happy birthday to me, man.  So it was really cool.  That's awesome.  That is fucking great.  And this was actually with Ace and Peter, the whole...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  All the original members.  It was awesome.  Oh, that's awesome.  I met them, but God, fucking Ace wasn't there.  I mean, not that Tommy's a bad guitarist, but it's like, I wanted Ace.  We got Ace for your birthday.  That's not the same.  It was wonderful.  A couple years ago, we got Ace freely for Jimmy's birthday, right in studio.  It was amazing.  Jimmy's about the whole collection.  He brought the cake in.  Nice.  One shot.  Yeah, Ace gave me my cake.  He brought the cake in for you.  The cake was a girl's...  It was a picture of a girl's ass with a chocolate log coming out of it, but I still would have taken 
[03:07:00]  all four of them singing to me on the plane.  Why don't you explain to Josh why the cake looked like that, Jimmy?  I don't know.  Just so we could get along a little bit here.  They were just trying to make it look like there was shit coming out of it.  He understands.  He's a rock star.  Nothing to shock his mind.  You like girls to defecate on you?  No, no, no, no, no.  I don't like that.  Negatory.  I don't like that.  I just hate me.  So I guess...  I guess it all depends on how you look at it.  It's Purell on the chest one way or the other.  You know.  Yeah, you might have to put plastic down every once in a while. 
[03:07:30]  Did you get a picture?  Yeah.  Jesus.  Did you get a picture with the band?  I'm such a fruit.  Oh, yeah.  I got pictures of that kind of thing.  What's your favorite fucking photo that you've ever got with somebody?  That's a tough one, man, because there's a lot of great ones.  I got a really, really good picture I got with Tony Alame when we first got on the Black  Sabbath tour.  That was a dream come true, and it's probably my favorite one out of all of them.  Yeah, I would have to say Sabbath for me, too.  I got them at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction.  Oh, yeah?  That was a tough one.  Excellent.  Excellent. 
[03:08:00]  It's really hard to get them all four together.  Real hard.  Makes me very sad.  They were squabbling.  Yeah, all four buses, four different managers, the whole nine yards.  Yeah, it was crazy.  Yeah, it seems like Ozzy has kind of kept a little separate, even when they were touring  together.  Definitely.  And, you know, you hate to see that, because you kind of think bands will all just hang  out and fucking share hotel rooms, and it's just not like that after a while.  Yeah.  We wish it was.  That's what happens when you start, see?  That's when you love the music and you're still into it, but then when it gets into  that corporate thing where everybody goes their own way and everything, that's what 
[03:08:30]  I'm really enjoying about, hell yeah, man.  It's just a total band thing.  I mean, the reason why we started the band and we wanted to get back to, the reason why  we started in the first place was we loved playing music.  We just wanted to be a big garage band, and there's a really great amount of camaraderie  in this band, and it's just a lot of fun, man.  Did I just bore you guys to death?  No, no, no.  No, not at all.  Not at all.  Makes a lot of sense.  Yeah, I mean, it's interesting to me, because I've never done anything.  I'm a bad collaborator.  It's hard for me to write things with people, and it's like, I can imagine if you write 
[03:09:00]  a song, and everybody else is like, ah, it stinks.  You're like, what?  It's got to be very difficult to navigate that type of stuff.  I don't think it goes that way.  Maybe not, but I mean...  Usually, like, yeah, we can probably twist it around and work it, and then the rest of the  guys in the band change it into something completely different, and then go, yeah,  your song rules.  That's usually the record producer that does it.  Yeah, or that.  Unless you didn't have a record producer.  That was your brother, because that's what happened to me.  My brother frickin', he would turn things around and just twist around. 
[03:09:30]  I was in a band for years, my whole, before I got into radio.  He actually wrote a very famous love ballad.  Oh, shut up.  What's it called?  That song.  Daria?  Daria.  Daria, yeah.  Daria.  Shut up.  This is old 80s crap.  Oh, stop it.  Embarrassing me.  This is from 1984.  I'm old.  I need to light a lighter.  Is that E-Rock playing it?  That's all he is, bastard. 
[03:10:00]  Thanks.  Do you guys have any stuff you go back over?  Thanks, E-Rock.  I'll look at my old material and want to hang myself, and Ant listens to stuff that he sang  or Opalist and his old stuff.  Oh, it's just brutal.  Have it on tape, you know?  Do you ever listen to old stuff before the record contraction?  Absolutely.  You've got to ride a few turds to get where you've got to go.  I know.  For sure.  It really is.  You listen back to some old stuff you did and just go like, ugh, what the hell was I thinking?  Trying to actually fit into a certain time instead of just doing what you should be doing. 
[03:10:30]  You've got to start a song with that.  You should be doing this because that's what other bands are doing instead of just coming  up with your own fucking sound and whatever you want to do, you know?  I think those are the people that end up most successful is if you just say, fuck, you  know, what everyone else is doing, you've got to take that next step further.  Well, ACDC never did a ballad.  I don't think they ever did a softer song.  Did you guys ever, did Pantara ever do anything?  Yeah, we had a couple songs that were, you know, really deep and just kind of dark.  Cemetery Gates. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah, that's not really a ballad, ballad, but we had a song called...  I love that song.  ...called Floods off of Great Southern Trent Kill that was really open and deep.  And, you know, it's good as a musician to be able to go through those peaks and valleys  with music and to, you know, not always be balls out, you know?  Yeah, I guess some band...  I remember when Kiss did Beth in 76, I mean, no one could believe that they had put, like,  that slow love song.  Great song, man.  Biggest song ever.  That annoys Gene, too.  Yeah, Gene hates that.  He hates that.  Gene hates that.  That is the biggest song ever for the band. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah.  He said it on our show, didn't he?  He was like, no, he didn't say he hates it, but he goes, you know, an interesting story  about how he named her Beth.  Like, I forget what he said.  Peter wanted to call her, you know, but it was like a...  He had to make sure everyone knew that he had something to do.  He had to handle it, yeah.  Yeah.  We have a love-hate relationship with Gene Simmons.  We just have to put that on the table.  Yeah, Jimmy loves him.  I hate him.  I love him, yeah.  He might have tried to pick up Anthony's chick at the time, but...  Yeah.  I just...  They can do no wrong in my eyes.  I'm only a 42-year-old man.  Why shouldn't I talk like a 13-year-old girl? 
[03:12:00]  I really do make myself sick.  You should have seen me asking Justin Bieber for a photo yesterday.  I really...  I just humiliate myself.  That must have been fun.  I got him, though.  You know, I'm a man who's getting there.  Does it drive you nuts to see Justin Bieber as big as he is, and he doesn't have really  the talent to back it up?  On the Grammys, his performance was certainly flat, and he's okay, but he's not as great  as the world is making him out to be.  Teen Idol.  You know, my teenage daughter turned me on to him when he was just...  You know, his U2 performances, when it was just him and an acoustic guitar, and I really 
[03:12:30]  liked that.  You know?  Then when I heard his pop stuff, I just wasn't into it.  He's overproduced at this point.  Yeah.  I didn't like the show.  I thought it wasn't good, but...  Oh, you went to a Justin Bieber show?  No, the Grammy performance.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, just imagine that.  It's like, no, you're not here.  That would be the ultimate, like, come on, come on.  He shouldn't dance, really.  Yeah, he's really bad.  Is he a bad dancer?  He's really bad.  Justin Bieber?  Yeah, yeah.  I never noticed he was a bad dancer.  He's horrible.  And he shouldn't wear tough guy clothes, either.  I think it's all going to go away, because his balls are starting to drop. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah, yeah.  That shit goes quick.  Yep.  I should have Twittered my photo with him.  It really is.  To see two teen idols together like that, I mean, he's got, like, the little hand like  that, you know.  And all I'm looking at is my side fat.  I really look like a fucking...  That is hilarious, dude.  That's actually...  What kind of phone is that?  That's a good picture.  Oh, it's an iPhone.  I took it with my regular camera and uploaded it.  But all I can see is my side fat.  Vinny, I just...  Vinny, no one cares.  I'm boring myself.  I don't know anything about Justin Bieber, so forget it if you're going to ask me about 
[03:13:30]  that.  Go ahead.  You shouldn't.  Everyone is saying, Dimebag, Dimebag.  We know, but we don't know what to ask you about that, Vinny.  There's not a lot to ask me about, man.  I know.  People fucking are...  They're like, you know, it's his brother.  Yes, we know everything.  But wait...  I don't know what you wanted to say about that or anything.  We don't want to put you...  Basically, you know, it's...  He's left behind an amazing legacy.  You know, he lives on through his music, his spirit.  And, you know, I carry the torch high.  And I do what I can to make sure that his legacy lives forever.  And, you know, anybody that thinks that there's a way of replacing him or finding someone 
[03:14:00]  else to be a part of Pantera is just ridiculous, you know?  And I'll never be a part of it, you know?  And that band has an amazing legacy that'll be left untouched, you know?  And that's the way it should be.  Yeah.  So you're happy you did what you did and you're kind of like, all right, we moved on.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, we'd already moved on anyways.  We were in Damage Plan, obviously.  All right.  And we were looking forward to doing something new and different.  And, you know, the bridges had been burnt and we were not going to re-cross them, you 
[03:14:30]  know?  So there you have it.  Pat, the lead singer of Damage Plan, I met at a Florentine surprise birthday party.  They had a sabra-cadabra play and Pat showed up.  He's an odd guy.  I forget whose hand he shook.  He shook someone's hand and he held it for like five minutes.  I think it was this guy Chuck just to give him the creeps.  And he wouldn't let his hand go.  Yeah, it was really kind of bizarre.  Think about having Pat on Meet the Creeps next time around.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I liked him a lot, though.  But he's definitely a psychopath. 
[03:15:00]  It's like, I was very surprised.  Like, Chuck didn't hit him because he knew it was Jim's friend.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But he wouldn't let it go.  Like, he wouldn't end it.  I'm just laughing, thinking at Jim's surprise party.  Oh, I'm so surprised.  Yeah.  My fucking balls.  Has Florentine showed you guys those balls?  All he talks about is big balls.  He's got big balls, right?  Oh, they're fucking balls.  The last couple times I've seen him, he's had his new girlfriend with him, so I'm sure  he's been pretty reserved in his, you know.  Vinny, it's not gay to look, I'm telling you.  Yeah.  I mean, I'll look.  It's an oddity.  You should look.  You should look.  Because it's just, it's ridiculous how big they are. 
[03:15:30]  I actually signed my first dick last year.  Did you really?  Yeah.  Signed my dick.  You're crazy, dude.  Was there enough room for Todd, or you just had to go with Josh?  He's just JT.  He was 18.  Wait, someone asked you to sign their cog?  In Europe, yeah.  We were at a signing, and this young kid is like, dude, you signed my dick?  And I'm like, no, I'm not signing your dick, man.  And he walked off, and he was with all his buddies, and they were all hammered. 
[03:16:00]  And they just kept hanging around.  And I'm like, all right, dude, this is the deal.  You take it out and stretch it out.  I'll sign it, but I'm not touching it.  Right, you just hold the sharpie at the end.  You have to stretch it out like a T-shirt.  You don't want to keep out the stretch of the T-shirt.  That is crazy, man.  Like signing parchment.  Put it over his friend's back, and then just sign it.  So I'm thinking, this guy's got to have a big dick, or he wouldn't be doing this.  But he didn't.  It stretched out.  It was probably like three inches.  Oh, no.  Signed it.  I imagine in Europe it would be easier, though, because if you're uncircumcised, there's 
[03:16:30]  a little more room to sign.  Because I'd hate to have to finish Norton and go over the ridge onto the head.  It was uncircumcised.  Yeah, it was unclipped.  An unclipped European who had been drinking.  I'm sure that was a fucking...  That top's the craziest thing I ever signed.  I had a dude come running up to me one time, and, hey, man, will you sign my leg?  And I'm like, yeah, sure.  And he pulls it off and hands it to me.  And I just about had a heart attack.  And it had the whole album cover spray painted on the side of it and everything.  And this thing smelled horrible. 
[03:17:00]  Of course it did.  I signed it for him.  He popped it back on.  It took off.  I was like, did that just happen?  I mean, really?  I have a guy who asked me to sign his ass in...  I forget where I was.  But he had my name tattooed on his ass.  Oh, Lord.  And I saw him at his show.  Kenny might remember where it was.  And my...  I have a photo.  He actually looked...  Not even gay, but the guy had a good...  If you're going to sign a man's ass, thank God he wasn't a Greek or a Mediterranean fellow.  Because it wasn't very hairy. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah, you want the name to be visible.  And my name is tattooed on his ass.  And he came up a couple years later and showed it to me.  Why would he do that?  Why wouldn't he is the question.  It's not.  Please.  Come on.  Yeah, but I had to do it.  You have to do it.  It's not gay.  It's like fucking...  No.  It's not gay.  What's better than when a girl asks you to sign her tits?  It's fantastic.  I finally got gay.  Well, that's great.  Yeah.  I've signed some labias.  That's great when they're good.  Really?  Oh, sometimes.  Labias.  Oh, I've never signed a pussy.  No, I've apologized for my performance a few times, but I've never signed one.  How do you go about signing that? 
[03:18:00]  That seems a little difficult, too.  It was over the panties, but she's been over, and her little burger just stuck out there.  Oh, I fucking love that.  It was fantastic.  Yeah, that's the type of vagina I like, too.  One that you can really write.  Just fucking...  The lips flop down like a long...  Like you're about to write a proclamation.  Fucking like the Bill of Rights on her twat.  Sacred scrolls.  Jam on one side and Norton on the other.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what I like.  Fuck, man.  I've never signed a vagina, though.  And comedians don't get breasts.  Like, that's...  For you guys, breasts are like fucking... 
[03:18:30]  Oh, we got a lot of breasts over the years.  Yeah, we've actually done better than most guys who aren't musicians do with tits.  Yeah.  That's fantastic.  That's because we were out, you know, doing something.  It's a good life.  It's like we're walking around going, hey, here's some of my tits.  Those flapjack-y ones, though.  Ugh.  Those flapjacks.  Whatever.  You can find something good in them.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's a few you can't, though.  Anyway.  Yeah, the nipple.  The chewed-out, nasty, fucking gravy-stained nipple.  I like that, though.  I like a big, big areola.  Yeah, me too.  It's nice, right? 
[03:19:00]  I like some symmetry there, though.  Yeah, I like them both to be just giant.  I like dark areolas, too.  Yeah.  Sometimes, yeah, Tracy Lord had big, slow-fade pink nipple ones.  Those were nice, but I like a fucking nice...  I like the fade.  The fade is all right.  Big, thick nipple.  Right?  It's like going with the slow fade, no?  It's fucking great.  It's good.  Yeah, slow fade is hot, too.  I like the slow fade.  Those pointy tits.  I like tits that are, like, heavy and kind of awkwardly pointy.  Those are nice, too.  I like weird shit on a chick, man.  Weird shit on you.  I thought I saw Kira Sedgwick on the flight, but I didn't know. 
[03:19:30]  You should have taken a picture with her just in case.  No, because she was sitting.  I kept looking at this lady.  She was on that nipple.  She was in the lounge before the flight, and I just kept looking at her nipples, and she  moved seats.  I creeped her out in the lounge.  She got up and sat.  She got up and left?  Yeah.  I was like, well, fucking put a scarf over your tits, then.  Don't walk around and stick it out like that.  Was she very flat-chested?  No!  No!  They were big, looked fake.  Really?  Oh, nice.  You are a fool.  Very nice.  Yeah, I'm a really unattractive man. 
[03:20:00]  Well, the show tonight, it's not Nokia.  Yeah.  What is it?  Best Buy?  Best Buy.  Best Buy.  Oh, yeah.  I'm promoting the show, man.  Yeah, we should promote the show.  I'm sure there's just a few tickets available.  Where is the best?  That's here in the city, right?  It used to be the Nokia.  Yeah, it's the old Nokia theater.  All right, it's the Jägermeister tour, and there's a lot of dates you can get them at  Jägermusic.com.  That's J-A-G-E-R music, so don't go fucking putting in a Y.  Hey, you dummy.  Can I give away this whole thing?  Ooh.  I think we've got a pair of tickets to the Jägermeister show tonight, starring Buck 
[03:20:30]  Cherry and Hell Yeah.  I can throw in the guitar.  A Jägermeister Schecter guitar.  Really?  You've got the PV amp and a tap machine.  What's that?  Oh, I've got a Jägermeister tap machine.  A Jägermeister machine.  You've got three or six of these popping like two.  Tell them about our Jägermeister machine that almost got us kicked off the radio.  And Jäger girls, too.  Oh, yeah.  Jäger girls.  Vinny, we lost our jobs for about two and a half years, and we finally get back, and we  had this Jägermeister machine, and we almost fucking got thrown off a month in. 
[03:21:00]  Wow.  And we finally had to have a meeting among ourselves and get the fucking Jägermeister machine out  of the studio.  Yeah, those things are dangerous, man.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, man.  It's dangerous if you don't drink responsibly.  Nice.  Drink responsibly.  Icy cold comes out of those machines.  It's so great, man.  One girl, and we believed that she was pretty fucked up before she got in the studio.  Of course she was.  She tried to leave.  We don't believe it.  We would sign a deposition saying that she was.  Oh, we certainly would. 
[03:21:30]  She tried to leave by going through a window, and we were on the third floor.  That's...  Wow.  Wow.  Thank God I didn't fuck a girl with no condom on that day.  No, no.  I don't drink, but alcohol is my friend.  I help them hit bottom.  Well, the show hit bottom.  The show hit bottom, too, because we do morning radio, and around nine in the morning, there  was one girl, completely naked, crying, right outside the building on the sidewalk here  in Manhattan, as real people are going to work in business.  Wow. 
[03:22:00]  And that's when we sat down.  I don't kill her.  What are we doing?  I don't kill it.  No, that's when I said to you as we walked home, it was Thanksgiving of 05.  We came back October 4th of 05, and I'm like, dude, it's a month.  Right?  Yeah.  We're going to fucking blow it.  We had to sit two years, almost two and a half years.  So you'd think we would have learned something in our time off.  Oh, wow.  Jimmy, yeah, we had a heart-to-heart, like, what the fuck are we doing?  There's a month.  Right.  So, yeah, drink responsibly.  I mean, those girls certainly weren't that day, and they were not doing the...  They did a little Jaeger, but they had a lot of other shit going on. 
[03:22:30]  It was great.  Trust me.  Jaegermeistermusic.com.  And even though we're not, we're here in New York, we're all over the country, so there's  other dates, all dates, you can go to jaegermusic.com.  If you don't live in New York or wherever you live, just go check for dates.  Tonight's show.  Yes.  Oh, Brother Joe wants in before we get out of here for the day.  And it's Brother.  Brother Joe, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hold on, Evan.  He's grabbing his headphones, Joe.  How you doing?  I've just been listening, and you guys, like, talk about Jaegermeister like it's some kind  of a hardcore drink.  It's fucking candy, man. 
[03:23:00]  We drink nothing but Jameson's.  Yeah, but let me tell you something.  Yeah?  Let me tell you something.  What do you do after that?  Try to fuck your cat?  Pretty much, man.  Any pussy that's alive, yeah.  I absolutely know.  No, no, I've never been drunk on Jaegermeister, man.  Oh, my God.  That's because you're an alcoholic, Joe.  I've been loaded pretty well off of Jaeger.  Remember that time at bar nine? 
[03:23:30]  Yeah.  When they kept bringing up shot after shot, and I was just like, oh, my God.  I couldn't walk up the stairs.  It was fantastic.  Yeah.  It's super sweet shit.  It just does nothing for me.  Now, Jameson's, I mean, we drink that on a time.  Hey, Joe, if this was the Jameson music tour, maybe you should call in.  And you know what the difference between Jameson and Jaegermeister is?  You do know what the sponsor is, don't you?  And we actually...  Jaegermeister makes music sound better.  I don't know what Jameson's does to you, but Jaegermeister makes music sound better.  That's like a... 
[03:24:00]  Why don't we talk about an ACDC tribute band right now?  Let's talk about...  Oh, no, just a better U2 tribute band.  Yeah.  Yeah, Joe.  You know who's great?  Jim Laird is a great singer in a U2 tribute band.  He is, but he doesn't fucking sing anymore.  He doesn't go out and sing anymore.  That's because he's drinking Jameson.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Because that shitty Jameson he's drinking instead of wonderful Jaegermeister.  Holy shit.  You heard...  From the Jaegermeister music tour.  You ever see the Jameson's ad?  It says Jameson's one step above come. 
[03:24:30]  Nobody likes that shit.  It's disgusting crap.  Exactly.  It actually comes in a fucking cock-shaped bottle, and you squeeze the balls, and it leaks  all over your face.  And then your life partner licks it off, and you get a small dog and walk him in the  fucking Chelsea together.  How many gay things do I know?  Jameson's actually comes with poppers and a hole in the wall.  Yeah, we got Jaegermeister people looking at us right now, Joe.  Jesus.  The Jaegermeister people.  We'll talk about your love of Jameson tomorrow.  Hey, listen.  I have no problem with Jaegermeister. 
[03:25:00]  They sent me a machine when they canceled my tribute band show down in Texas.  Oh, fuck.  So I don't have a problem with you.  Fuck.  All right.  All right.  Fucking guy.  Thank you, brother Joe.  It's all about Jaegermeister today.  Jaegermeistermusic.com.  These guys got the show tonight here in New York.  I think we gave away the tickets by now.  It was a pleasure, man.  Hell yeah.  It's been a long time, and Josh, a long time.  Thanks for having us.  It's been many years since we've talked to you guys.  Have a great time on the tour, man.  It's going to be a blast, man.  Yes, sir. 
[03:25:30]  When you come through New York, come by and say hi.  You got it.  Every time.  We're here every fucking day.  When they change the name of the fucking Best Buy Center there, you can come by again.  All right.  Yeah, they will.  Yes, the Jameson Center.  Everybody's just sucking cock.  All men sucking cock.  Fuck that swill.  What is Joe doing to me?  No.  He just lost his mind.  Joe doesn't think things through sometimes.  What the fuck, Joe?  I got to be honest.  Joe doesn't think things through sometimes. 
[03:26:00]  I thought he was going to go back to Jaegermeister.  It's like, don't you understand?  It's Jaegermeister music tours.  Holy shit.  He's probably having that fun.  He's probably on his cell phone in his undershorts in a bar like fucking Mickey Rourke in Barfly.  I guess we should go home.  I have to tape my other show.  I'm stalling because someone's on the hotline.  I'm wondering if it's Joe to apologize or what.  Who's on the hotline, E-Rock?  That is his number.  It's still Joe.  He wants to come back on.  All right.  For what?  What is he going to do now? 
[03:26:30]  Hello?  Is he going to praise Howard now for the next 20 minutes?  Joe, Joe, what are you going to rant about how great terrestrial radio is?  Fuck satellite.  Why pay for it when it's free?  I have an iPod.  Yes, Joe.  I'll behave.  I'll behave with the nice Jaegermeister people.  I just wanted to plug the show that we have this Thursday.  Perfect.  Fuck you, Joe.  He just got neutered.  Oh, man.  I never thought I would do that to Ed's brother.  Oh, damn. 
[03:27:00]  I say fuck you, Joe.  No, if he ever earned it, it was today.  He earned that hangout.  He'll plug tomorrow.  Yeah, let him plug.  As long as he's not plugging April 30th at fucking Foxwoods, the anti-social comedy tour  with me, Brewer, Attell, and fucking Bill Burr.  I don't care what he's doing.  I don't think he was.  Good.  Glad I got that one out.  Boo.  Now, let's thank Vinnie Paul and Josh Todd.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks, guys.  Appreciate it.  Yeah, let's get at it.  Later.  See you tomorrow.  Right on.  This is the Obedien 3 Show.  The Obedien and Anthony Show.  The virus.
