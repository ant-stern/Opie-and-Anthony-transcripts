<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly between serious discussions and shockingly crude humor.  The show opened with a meta-discussion about their controversial on-air personas and the perceived pressure on radio to be "nice," immediately transitioning into a review of recent box office numbers for films like *Mamma Mia*, *Step Brothers*, and a surprisingly disappointing *The X-Files*, despite David Duchovny's prior appearance on their show. Opie then shared an anecdote about a Long Island wine trip with his parents, detailing their increasingly childish behavior and arguments.

A significant portion focused on the show's removal from Buffalo's 103.3 The Edge, which Opie and Anthony vehemently attributed to cost-cutting rather than the station's stated reason of listener demand for more local programming.  They meticulously dissected an eight-page email from program director James Kertz ("Evil Jim"), exposing what they deemed to be fabricated justifications.  Numerous angry calls from Buffalo listeners followed.  Concerns about the show's future on XM satellite radio after the Sirius/XM merger, including potential layoffs, were interwoven throughout this segment.  Humorous interludes included Opie destroying a coffee mug and playing audio of former astronaut Edgar Mitchell ranting about alien visitation and government conspiracies. The discussion concluded with speculation about the radio industry's future in the digital age, ending with another humorous anecdote about a mouse infestation at a convenience store where Opie once worked.  Jimmy was present in studio during this segment.

The show then shifted gears, delving into a rambling conversation about theoretical physics, Eric Lerner's arrest for file-sharing, and a comparison of Michio Kaku and Carl Sagan.  Regret over not more forcefully criticizing Steve Martin's *Pink Panther* remake after a previous encounter with Mike Myers was also expressed. A significant portion of the show was dedicated to listener calls and heated discussions about the upcoming presidential election, particularly focusing on the racial aspects of Barack Obama's candidacy and often resulting in vulgar exchanges with callers.  Tangents included discussions of *The Dark Knight*, shaky cam in action movies, and Patrice O'Neal eating a foot-long sandwich.  The upcoming Opie and Anthony show, a $10 ticket promotion, a short film by Otto and George featuring Jesus, and the "FU Line" segment were also featured. Otto and another unidentified guest were in studio.

The next segment opened with discussion of a large Obama rally in Berlin, partially attributed to a German bandâ€™s performance. This transitioned into more racially charged caller discussions and a news story about a shooting at a children's performance of "Annie," prompting reactions ranging from shock to dark humor and discussions about vigilante justice. Anthony reacted violently and offensively to a listener email criticizing his political commentary.  The show then covered A&E's "I Survived," a 73-year-old Japanese man becoming a porn star, and another listener's account of subduing a home intruder at gunpoint.  A significant portion involved a cockroach infestation in the studio, leading to numerous calls about pest control and many off-color jokes.  The segment ended with a promotion for an upcoming comedy show and comments on their XM workplace environment. Otto from Otto and George was a studio guest for this segment as well.


A call-in segment featuring bizarre and often graphic listener anecdotes followed, including accounts of mouse extermination, drunken rat-stomping, and finding a roach in one's "ass crack."  Discussions continued on pest control, employing increasingly absurd methods.  The impending XM Radio layoffs were again discussed, alongside a reaction to a fake internet commercial for "Mandels" (men's candles), leading to a heated and vulgar exchange with a female caller.  The show also covered a bear attack and a gang's apology after attacking the wrong person.  A Mr. T Snickers commercial pulled for homophobic content was discussed, followed by the "line of the day" segment.  The hosts also mentioned emptying their agent Bob Eatman's minibar after a Letterman appearance.


The final excerpt began with a graphic description of a pornographic video titled "You Suck at Fucking My Wife," detailing the actor's premature ejaculation.  This was followed by discussions of "runner-up lines of the day," the website HotMovies.com (with specific fetish categories mentioned), and a graphic video featuring an amputee woman.  The segment concluded with a comedic song about quitting a job, filled with vulgar lyrics and exaggerated descriptions of workplace frustrations.

[00:11:00]  all they could think of is that dumb clinic sort of voice he's doing good movie was good but that  was irritating that's the way you do it too i ain't batman we've heard we've heard recognize the  mask thank you exactly the pointy ears the big cape and the b you didn't have to really say it yeah  yeah yeah you have a car with a bat on it so we get it i have to become a person shut up  yeah um i got a i got a slight dilemma i don't know if people uh like or dislike when we go down 
[00:11:30]  this road but uh every phone is on hold and they're all buffalo listeners what to do what to do  oh really yeah they took us off the air officially in buffalo for uh edge edge morning music oh now  it's official we're done yeah sons of bitches yeah you see i got an email one of the listeners sent 
[00:12:00]  me an email they got from the station about it do we have that uh stunt brain you know um why don't  you just be honest with the listeners instead of trying to spin it they're they're basically telling  the listeners that they asked for this they asked to hear music in the mornings that they could get  from their ipod no they didn't they didn't you're lying i love on stage you do that you asked for it  and we gave it to you we told you what uh what the deal is that companies in uh financial ruins 
[00:12:30]  and it was a cost-cutting move simple as that yeah simple as that our stockholders asked for it and  they got it right a cost-cutting move yeah in this day and age no one is asking to hear music on  their radio station they can do that with their ipod their iphone their their their internets uh-huh  their 3g's their wi-fi's uh and i know this is a complete lie because i know the guy who wrote this 
[00:13:00]  and i know he's not happy that we're not on in buffalo who wants to read this today  well you guys want to break split the duty up it's eight pages as a valued edge cyber club member  i want to write you directly about the change we've made in mornings at rock radio 103.3 the edge  as of 9 a.m this morning the edge will no longer carry the opian anthony show thanks there are many  reasons for this decision and i will share some of them with you can i ask a quick question yes what 
[00:13:30]  is a value what is he an edge cyber club member how does one become a whoa whoa whoa a valued  cyber club member how do you become one what do you get from being that this i don't know what it is  we were up there for uh two years i i never heard of the cyber club member what is that we've we've  been very serious in our u008 initiative what the it's like 2008 but there's a u yeah so i'm guessing 
[00:14:00]  it's listener control right which isn't really listener control at all because they would never  put the listeners uh in charge of anything too much money at stake the last 10 instant feedbacks all  from buffalo all from buffalo uh we have been very serious in our u008 initiative much of our music  contest weekend themes and other programming have been driven by you as part of this plan we've been  overwhelmed by two major factors first we are bombarded with calls and emails asking us to be 
[00:14:30]  more local in the morning that is such bs that's more crap that is bs that's oh that is bs just liars  just effing liars man that wasn't happening you're lying but who would call and say in those words  could you be more local i want more local programming i need my local traffic it doesn't 
[00:15:00]  happen no one's ever called a radio station and said could you be more local no no i've been in radio  for a few years i've never gotten that call no hey could you be more local all righty i was traveling  down the fdr today oh wow you were just local for new york new york a little local yeah shut up  there's so many places to get traffic and weather and all that stuff and every every city has 10  stations you can get that from local five seconds 1940 shut up that local thing is such a lie because 
[00:15:30]  uh most radio stations i swear to god you wouldn't know it was a local station by what you're hearing  in between the records because there's not much local stuff going on oh uh well uh bombarded with  calls and emails bombarded you want bombarded you stupid son of a bitch we could get you bombarded  believe me we can bombarded with calls and emails asking us to be more local in the morning even 
[00:16:00]  hardcore fans of ona have expressed those sentiments shut up shut up this is what we got to deal with  how did you know it was a hardcore ona i don't get it james kurtzeal is a lying sack of crap  even hardcore fans of ona have expressed those sentiments so no they didn't they're loving the  opian anthony show but then they're going but you know what i need the local news and weather need 
[00:16:30]  them local yeah we need weather and news but this business sucks uh even hardcore fans of ona have  expressed those sentiments the other concern shared by many of you is that since ona and trenta reagan  don't play music the edge hasn't felt like the rock station that it used to be they got their ipods  for that hold on a minute uh brian and buffalo what's going on boys hey how are you brian you're 
[00:17:00]  missing buffalo already yeah well the morning show is accepting calls about ona this morning 716-644-9 edge  so they decided to take us off um you know i think some people were holding out hope that they would  like wake up over the weekend and and and not do this but they've decided to do this right now  they're playing the goo goo doll slide if you care there you go that's what that's what they were 
[00:17:30]  bombarding them with that's what you the buffalo listener demanded today goo goo doll slide that's  what you demanded not hearing jimmy do jimsy or his batman impression no you want the goo goo  dolls slide actually with those two examples you're probably right uh let's say hi to john  buffalo john hey guys hey john yeah it's small consolation i know but the guy who was on there 
[00:18:00]  was saying you know oh man i gotta play for me he doesn't i don't think he likes it anymore he  probably likes you guys he probably listened to you guys i don't know who he is or anything  because i turned it off i uh i've been emailing this jim guy the program director of rock radio 103.3  the edge off and on for the last two years trust me he's lying through his teeth because he's trying  to save his own gig and i don't blame him to be honest with you this came down from corporate and  they said write this and and put your name to it well they might as well get ready to change formats 
[00:18:30]  because they're not getting ratings the rest of the day so you know they'll be doing playing  country next or some crap you know i don't know sir people demand local programming yes they're  clamoring for it they don't want to hear bombarding the station yes we don't want to hear laughs in  the morning let's talk about the trough yeah let's say hi to robert in buffalo robert hey guys i was  throwing in this is bs i you guys are awesome i listened to you last like eight years you know i'm 
[00:19:00]  2008 how about me not listen anymore in 2008 thank you and you have a very comfortable speaking voice and  now they're now they just ran a sweeper that says uh they just ran a sweeper shredding reagan in the  afternoon for free 103.3 the edge now playing lincoln park so now they're trying to encourage our  listeners not to go and get you know satellite radio or figure out that they can listen to our  show still through their iphone i hate everyone involved in radio i just hate them all they're 
[00:19:30]  they're wormy liars what you know i would have a lot more respect if they said look it was a cost  cutting move we loved ona and this is what we got to do we're gonna be honest and we're gonna make  the best of it i mean to lie and make us look like idiots is just that's not cool that they were  friggin uh bombarding them with calls and emails no they weren't that line even the hardcore feds of  ona have expressed those sentiments that they wanted local programming you know what uh they 
[00:20:00]  pretty much have to save all of those things for the public record right show me show me the emails  i want to see them i want to see the clamoring of of uh emails uh that demand local programming  yeah good you got them on file post them show me uh and then it continues first of all everyone  here at the edge has a great deal of respect for opie anthony you will hear some people say that 
[00:20:30]  the show failed here and that's why this is happening but that couldn't be further from the  truth so if it didn't fail why are we off the air this morning cost cutting ona were successful in  western new york and we uh remain honored to have carried them for the last two years so so for the  haters out there because they they're spinning everything we do these days we were successful even  the fnpd is saying that so even the lying pd is saying that right part of our plan two years ago  was to grow the station by putting buffalo radio legends shredder reagan in afternoons the move 
[00:21:00]  of that show has been a tremendous uh success by adding ona to our lineup in mornings we created  compelling radio that buffalo embraced while our plan was indeed a tremendous success it is now time  to move to the next level in the future of rock radio in western new york starting this monday  meaning uh right now anthony i will go on the air in the morning dealing you the rock music you  demand wait this idiot is gonna actually go on the air he's the one yeah get us some tape 
[00:21:30]  he doesn't want to do this by the way i got a a secret secret email from this guy and you know  screw it i'll blow up his body goes uh they're gonna they're forcing me to do an air shift instead  of uh continuing to carry you guys yeah this guy has no desire to be on the air he wants to be the  program director behind the scenes he rock had a good one the one of the emails dear the edge  please be more local sincerely farid so uh so he's gonna be playing the rock music you demanded 
[00:22:00]  what what song did uh the listeners of buffalo demand i i need to hear i need to know what the  next song is oh he is uh you'll have uh direct access to me i will answer any and all questions we  will also create an ona forum at wedg.com for you to share your thoughts on this decision as your  opinion matters feel free to call me monday at seven one six six four four nine edge there's a  lot of negative press about radio in the 21st century but understand that buffalo is different 
[00:22:30]  i'm from south buffalo and i've known these three words my entire life the three words i'm a douche  hey hey what uh buffalo expects more is the uh the three lines anthony with that being said we're now  poised to give you more it is with mixed emotions that opie and anthony depart we must now look to  the future and the opportunity we have to produce a buffalo based morning show that can belong to  our community yeah my stomach hurt a morning show that will not only entertain you but give you the 
[00:23:00]  content control and buffalo material that you expect from us  we will invest in our morning show they didn't invest in us they just flipped the switch and we  did good we will invest in our morning show and our ability to be a 100 buffalo radio station i look  forward to telling you all about it in the coming weeks they don't have a plan by the way this came  out of left field this guy has of course no clue what's going to happen next i hope to see you at 
[00:23:30]  uh edge fest 2008 on saturday and that's uh james kertz kertz kertz kertz program director rock radio  one point three the edge so uh there you go let's say hi to jim jim what's going on uh just so you  guys know his nickname around here is evil jim and he started off as an intern at shred and reagan's show  so i was pretty quick i actually know evil jim very well and i can't trash the guy because i i know 
[00:24:00]  damn well that this was not his decision and he's just trying to save his little radio gig the station  was very cool to us man this is uh you know just doing what they're told i'm sorry go ahead that's  right um no it's your show i'm sorry man uh the three words that which should be for buffalo is  buffaloians are crybabies because if you just get x-time or if you get an iphone you'll be able to  listen to you guys stop whining and i say we should attack the other morning shows in revenge  for taking you guys off because they're a bunch of total hacks anyway all right jim thank you so 
[00:24:30]  much well i don't understand the thing the three words my entire life buffalo expects more is that  like a big thing up there like where buffalo residents just expect more jimmy i uh lived in  western new york for off and on 10 years i uh did three years in buffalo i've never heard that saying  i i lived in buffalo for three years never saw that on a t-shirt never saw it on a bumper sticker  never saw it on a coffee mug never saw it written in the sky over the city never saw it at a bills 
[00:25:00]  game doesn't exactly seem like a teen anthem we expect more  it's terrible it really is oh this business like anthony says it's just uh it's just people in  it it's just ridiculous it's like the only no well not the only business i guess any business like big  business people just lie they could just lie to you that's what they do yeah that's a big business 
[00:25:30]  does they lie to you none of them can be men just come out and go look this is the way it is it's  honest but we we have to do it this way and that's that's on the corporate side all right we got to  take our first break but uh that's what's going on going on in buffalo and by the way they are lying  to us because they said they're that we're going back on in syracuse and uh we're not on in syracuse  this morning no so what they decide not to do that now  we all know why we all know why let's be honest why starts with a j ends with a w s no oh starts 
[00:26:00]  with an m ends with an r m oh n m oh oh it's different no an m and an instant r  you know no he's he was close though all right we got to take a break we're just babbling it's a 
[00:26:30]  big word mystery it certainly is you wanted local programming you're gonna get word mystery  what are they playing right now uh you rock commercials all right so i'm sure they  what did they entertain their buffalo audience with the last 20 minutes you only heard two songs and  what else was on there that's local stuff oh wait all right well hold on because we are going to  move on to other things this is not a good way to start in norfolk virginia i want to say hi to 
[00:27:00]  everyone listening in norfolk virginia we lose one we gain one that's how business works and then  they'll hate us and they'll get rid of us and then then spokane washington will pick us up  this business is so stupid here's the first break uh instead of us and buffalo this is what they're  playing today lincoln park rock radio 1033 the edge you knew that was like it is uh evil jim i'm tired

[00:29:00]  they wanted to continue with us for like 50 g's a year  and we said no and they said all right then uh we're gonna go do something else 50 g's for a morning  show in buffalo is a bargain yeah and we were all we were gonna do it for just a little more than  that it's a cost-cutting move so now they're trying to spin it and say you demanded that we be local  you demanded edge music no one's demanding that stuff no you wanted to get us ridiculously cheap 
[00:29:30]  and we're like well all right how about just a little cheap and they said no  we weren't making any real money off uh the buffalo market no with with without getting into the  business plan trust me we we share a lot of that money with a lot of people  and then they just lie through their teeth hence  the breaking of many things in the studio during the commercial break but i'm okay now  i go to kenny what happened to my coffee mug he goes uh you smashed it into a thousand pieces gh

[00:30:30]  ah unbelievable all right uh at least we picked up a top 10 yeah we're doing good and we're  supposed to be back on in syracuse but i guess they're lying through their teeth about that i don't  know this this citadel they took us off syracuse and said well we're taking you off syracuse but  we're going to keep you on in buffalo until at least january and then we're going to try to figure  out something past january i'm like all right sucks for syracuse but we really we've been in 
[00:31:00]  buffalo for so long that's that's kind of good news for us and then a week goes by oh we made a  mistake actually we're going to take you off buffalo we're going to put you back on syracuse even  though we already told the syracuse listeners that uh we got a show called shut up and rock  yeah so now they have to get rid of the shut up and rock and bring us back great and that was  supposed to happen today but we're not on in syracuse so is that more lies is that more corporate lies  i don't even know at this point if it's they're that that calculated i just think it's pandemonium 
[00:31:30]  over there they were running around pulling their hair out just screaming up and down the hallways  taking just picking up the phone and go take it off put this on i don't know  just pandemonium it's like gordon gecko's office they've lost their mind  their collective minds leave it to anthony to bring back the funny because now that's all i'm  gonna think yeah just running around like maniacs you know how kids just run from one one side of 
[00:32:00]  the room to the other just pulling out their hair  what are we gonna do i don't know take this off say the people demanded it put out a press release  give me a shut up and rock show yes we need to do shut up and rock call it shut up and rock  get it the people needed it just write something that that has the word local in it we need to be 
[00:32:30]  local local radio stinks don't people understand that local radio stinks there's there's nothing fun  about it no and radio set up in such a way let me let me take you inside a little bit radio set up  in such a way if you truly wanted local because in that in that thing we just read they said even  the hardcore opian anthony fans demanded this see this is what the hardcore opian anthony fans do in 
[00:33:00]  buffalo okay if they're really loving what we're doing but they're like you know what i gotta i gotta  i gotta get some sports scores some local sports scores and some and maybe some traffic when we play  10 minutes of commercial guess what people do they search out maybe a little local uh programming and  then they go back to the show they really like listening to whatever local info they need or  they pop on their uh their iphone and do a little quick local news search no one demands local programming 
[00:33:30]  god uh let's say hi to paul in maine paul hey how's it going boys happy birthday jimmy  hey uh you know what really sucks worse than anything else is not only did they cram this  crap down your throat about it was listed choice they took you off in portland in lieu of christian  rock if you can believe it  christian rock i tuned in to listen to you guys and all of a sudden it was a praise the lord station 
[00:34:00]  holy smokes this and and i believe maine is another citadel station right so so there and you want to  like maybe uh imitate what's going on in the corporate office take me and anthony off christian  rock get him off get him off it's got to be the exact opposite of what it was i do christian put on  christian christian rock and then they hide for three months and then they like peek at the ratings  oh please oh please oh please oh god oh let's see if this christian rock is working jesus oh god down 
[00:34:30]  more the ratings dropped again oh god all right get a shut up and rock show we need to shut up and rock  show and me amen unbelievable that's wall street calling oh god what are they going to tell us  oh god what's our stock down to today what is it it's pennies yes it is oh this business is so 
[00:35:00]  stupid we got replaced by christian rock in maine portland maine and that's wonderful saw that coming  yeah yeah yeah because christian rock radio is just taking over the country of course it is  it's a it's a hotbed of activity in maine i guess  well and we move on yes we do now that the uh merger went through i guess yep yep we'll see what 
[00:35:30]  happens  yeah after they hose down the floors in washington oh after they well they run through there with the  machetes they look like rwanda it's gonna be a bloodbath uh for the people out there uh xm  was completely taken over by sirius satellite radio even though they they like to call it a merger it was  a it was a it was a takeover yeah it was certainly a takeover and um and i guess there's gonna be some 
[00:36:00]  kind of announcement today that makes it official and then all hell is gonna break loose with xm  satellite radio there is gonna be a team of guys going down to washington with machetes just  chopping heads off this week chop chop chop chop chop you think right now there's a lot of awkward  conversations in dc like they're gonna need people to help them get to another place in here  wow they're gonna keep this facility too it's just i just picture that scene with the consultants in 
[00:36:30]  office space where they walk in and they're talking it's like what do you do  well i i could deal with the people um i'm the guy that goes between the  i'll see you don't do anything could you describe your job please  i'm needed i'm necessary  there's gonna be a bloodbath mark our words  i would imagine hundreds of people are gonna be fired from xm 
[00:37:00]  hundreds i would say hundreds there's a lot of people down there redundant people will get fired  and just in case uh you're keeping track one of the message boards has it wrong we're down to 65 days  left on our xm um contracts oh and uh obviously we want to continue uh we're we're waiting for some  kind of phone call that might might give us uh some kind of hope that we will continue  65 days and counting before uh our contracts end with xm yeah and i don't want people to confuse the 
[00:37:30]  issue we definitely want to continue a phone call would be nice that's all i know they got uh bigger  things to worry about like uh lopping off the heads of the useless yeah i don't think they were going  to be making any phone calls before this went uh you know official you think we're sure you think  we're part of the useless i've been told in my life many times that i'm useless i've never been 
[00:38:00]  made to feel any other way yeah i've never been made to feel good yeah part of the team yeah so  so there's a lot of uh a lot of changes a lot of changes in this business lately and then uh local tv  here does a a fine little thing on uh pandora's box for the iphone so oh jesus oh oh for the iphone  yeah yeah yeah what's that uh where you could just pretty much listen to what you want to listen  to that's why these shut up and rock shows and and we you know they they demand edge music is just so 
[00:38:30]  ridiculous everyone has phones now capable of getting music this is the time in radio where you  have to find really solid you know uh shows that that that that could compete with iphones that could  compete with satellite radio that could compete with 3g technology yes 3g and could compete with  the wi-fi this isn't the time to like dump a a solid radio show and start playing music 
[00:39:00]  that's that's so obvious yeah yeah you could get anything on your uh phone now right and just plug  it right into your vehicle and listen to it through your radio well that's why norfolk is smart today  they're trying to build a radio station with like you know personality radio because you can't get you  just can't get that no that's the one thing you can't just whip up on uh on an internet radio or or 
[00:39:30]  your phone personality driven radio music just stop it don't try to sound like you're rocking uh  because if you're listening on your phone you're listening to what you want to listen to right not  listening to commercials it's just the way it is i've been uh building the ultimate op radio station on my uh  on my device i'll just call it my device device and and i'm fine tuning all the time like oh i gotta 
[00:40:00]  add this song drop this song i'm adding this i'm gonna drop this and i i almost got the perfect  perfect radio listening experience uh as far as music goes i don't need a radio station to do that for  me i could do it myself this guy is so pissed john and buffalo what's up yeah guys uh we don't even  get shut up and rock here in buffalo they just dump you out and give us terrible music so you  would have been a little happier if if at least they did the shut up and rock format that's sweeping 
[00:40:30]  the nation at least i could call in and complain to that bitch about how much i hate her yeah all  right thank you john i don't know what to tell you i'm sorry i'm sorry well like i got saved by xm so  it's all right all right cool xm serious now is that what it's called i don't even know what it's  called i don't know i don't know i'm sure they got the new logo of uh waiting it's gonna be called  the company we used to work for i don't want to get fired i don't want to we're holding out hope 
[00:41:00]  jimmy you never know in this business i don't want to get fired we're holding out hope that's all  we got that's all we got i want to get like guys you know we're gonna get rid of the old xm facility  it's a little costly but we got a nice new place for you here a few blocks away here's your new  badges yeah i would like that yeah you would sure like going into that building i would why not yeah  yeah the new place we have roaches in our xm building now there's roaches that is true it's

[00:44:00]  um patrice myself bob kelly otto and george voss also mike ribiglia and uh the great greg giroldo  this year very very good okay right before the break we were telling you about the big merger that  went down between the two satellite radio companies and we're hearing there's gonna be a bloodbath in  washington because sirius has taken over xm it's not a merger so sirius is pretty much going to use  all their people and get rid of the xm people that's a fact some of the xmers will survive yeah will 
[00:44:30]  we make the short list i i don't know because someone on instant feedback is like will you just tell  us already if you guys have a job we don't know we want to continue with uh satellite radio absolutely  but the fact is we got 65 days left on our contracts and no one's talking yet i mean they  got other things they had to worry about so we're hoping now that the merger is official then maybe  they come in and uh give us a little little phone call it's gonna be scary though because  after all those heads come off it's like they're gonna be coming up like in like butcher clothes  like the blood on the front going so you guys ready to negotiate okay ah next 
[00:45:00]  uh but but i hear the firings have begun uh anthony really some exclusive audio of that going oh  yes here's uh one poor soul trying to save his job what you do in an attack is you take the  specifications from the customers and you bring them down to the software engineers yes yes that's  that's right well then i just have to ask why couldn't the customers just take them directly to the  to the software people huh well i'll tell you why uh because engineers are not good at dealing with 
[00:45:30]  customers so you physically take the specs from the customer well no my secretary does that  or the facts huh so then you must physically bring them to the software people well  no yeah i mean sometimes what what would you say you do here well look i already told you i deal with 
[00:46:00]  the goddamn customers so the engineers don't have to i have people skills i am good at dealing with  people can't you understand that what the hell is wrong with you people that is absolutely what  goes on behind those closed doors there's gonna be a lot of those conversations going on the next 
[00:46:30]  couple of days someone's just pretty much crying to keep their job yeah but ah i got people skills  you ever fight for a job um no when i got fired it was for something that i couldn't defend  it was always bad what was that i have anything from you know when i was a kid just barely scraping  money together at a job it was always something bad i was you know pilfering or uh late all the  time habitually late absent things like that you know taking extensive lunch breaks leaving half a 
[00:47:00]  day yeah i sucked i was a very bad employee you ever fight for a job there jimmy believe it or not  i was i've only been fired once and i was five years sober when it happened laicose lamps  laicose lighting they were farm-based really high-end lighting i was doing um you like to buy a lamp yes  is your room too dark can you not read past 6 30 p.m 
[00:47:30]  ted's lamps ted's lamp service we come over we'll plug it right in for you  um what what was your job at this lighting company i i worked for christoph silver which  was a very high-end silverware place we worked in raritan center in edison and it was a major the  shipping hub so all the shipping the orders came through us and went out through us and then  christoph moved back to new york city and laicose lamps moved right into the warehouse so i just kind 
[00:48:00]  of stayed and they hired me well what would you say you did there um what was your job i mean i  would i would put the labels on the boxes and make sure the tape wasn't coming up because when a tape  comes off all of a sudden you got a lamp lost ah true but that truck backed in and i was right there  an hour later at least unloading it an hour later i was horrendous and then they finally fired me and  i'd never been fired before i knew i was in trouble though because as the shipping order came in 
[00:48:30]  they brought in this italian guy who spoke italian and worked his ass off and like well he's just kind  of here to help you oh okay that's cool just help good now i could do less work oh wait a minute i'm  fired and i collected unemployment for two years and did stand-up ah same that's how you got into my  career good for you yeah it was the best move ever could have happened to me very good i had a  lemonade i had a boss once i was i was habitually late just late all the time and i guess he had had it  at some point he had talked to me so many times about it and i just couldn't i couldn't get up 
[00:49:00]  very tired very sleepy and it was a job i hated so you know i can get up for this because i enjoyed  doing this but um i hated this job so i was never on time and um he came in one day and he goes  uh why don't you just punch out and go home and uh i was like oh because i'm late because yeah  okay and i assumed he just wanted me to go home that day you're thinking you're thinking beach day  i took it as a day off like cool i got a day off but apparently he never wanted me to come back 
[00:49:30]  wasn't that your uncle no he he did did that too that seems to be the way i get fired you had that  happen twice because as you're saying this i'm like well ants told this story and it was his uncle  that told him not to come come to work yeah it was that and then it was at a true mechanical  when i was uh working in the shop there making duct work and yeah he told me uh just leave go home  oh day off rock oh wait i'm done i'm fired whoops yeah do you know i worked for crousers like i was 
[00:50:00]  the night guy at the crousers it's like um it's a little convenience store and uh was in the brunswick  shopping center in north brunswick and uh i would close up at like 11 p.m and we had like a little  deli area with meats and stuff i'd make sandwiches and i noticed that there were little teeth prints  in all of the cheeses and the meats oh boy and little little black hash droppings so apparently  the mice had been coming in and eating and dropping little mouse duties and i there was just it was 
[00:50:30]  infested it was covered with mouse bites and mouse duty so i remember i talked to the district  manager i'm like i can't sell this this is gross and he's like that's all right just fine you can sell  it oh he saw he saw the teeth prints and he goes oh you can sell it so he told me just to cut around  the teeth prints and throw out the stuff that had been bitten into well at least he uh said that  and um i actually took a stand i was like norma ray i refused to sell the meat with feces in it  sure that worked out well for you i wound up just quitting i think i just didn't want to do it 
[00:51:00]  anymore yeah gave him my keys good story jim you gotta think a little i liked it yeah it's great  it should be 13 episodes should be built around it the guy who wouldn't sell mouse duty on the cheese  i think his little mice feet were just stomping around the meat as he's uh taking bites oh dragging  those giant gonads that they have across across the cheese it was really awful i was just stealing  cigarettes my stupid light blue cango what a dork a punchable white nerd stupid cracker 
[00:51:30]  hey you want to move on to uh edgar mitchell oh now for the faithful listeners they're they're  sitting there going you already did the edgar mitchell thing oh the story goes on yeah we got  more audio from dr edgar mitchell and now it's starting to look like he might be a little cuckoo  oh either that or he's completely telling the truth yeah you can't there's no middle ground here  last week uh what happened dr edgar mitchell did an interview and basically said that 
[00:52:00]  there's absolutely aliens the government is covering it up and the key to dr edgar mitchell  is that he was an astronaut he walked on the moon walked on the moon apollo 14 right  weren't you on apollo 14 so now a lot of people are very interested in what he has to say and we  got more audio from dr edgar mitchell we have buzz aldrin coming in friday so we can ask him  yeah just to say is this guy kind of a nut or is he buzz aldrin just goes shut up and punches me in  the face hit you no such thing as aliens laugh at you yeah buzz aldrin pops you one would you 
[00:52:30]  sure i'd laugh at me too be a pleasure imagine if buzz aldrin just knock my teeth out i'd love to have  a black eye from buzz aldrin yeah what happened who punched you buzz aldrin yeah you know all those  moon photos that guy yeah the guy on the moon an ungloved fist well if you if you would love that  then just say look just say it never happened never happened and all hell will break loose oh yes  because that's all it takes with him is to say look i think i think you guys fake the whole thing 
[00:53:00]  so all right uh dr edgar mitchell expands on his alien comments from last week let's see what he's  saying now when it comes to outer space edgar mitchell knows what he speaks of he's part of the apollo 14  moon mission in 1971 and fellow astronaut alan shepard walked on the lunar surface for a record nine and a 
[00:53:30]  half hours so when 77 year old mitchell said on british radio that aliens exist and have been  visiting earth and ufos people sat up and took notice i don't know how many or where or how they're  doing it but they've been observing us and here for quite some time mitchell goes further he says the 
[00:54:00]  famous alleged discovery of a ufo and its dead crew at roswell in 1947 did happen but he says this event  and many more have been covered up by the united states government the reason for the denial was  uh number one we didn't they didn't know if these were hostile and could we uh protect ourselves from  them didn't want the soviets to know so they devised to to lie about it and cover it up 
[00:54:30]  i um pretty huge stuff right here nah i don't think there are aliens now that i think about it  no nope why i don't believe this guy it would make the whole world behave yeah but that's why it's  secret wouldn't you want the whole world to behave not the illuminati and working together no all you  would have to go is look they got crazy technology here's the alien people and then the whole world  would start behaving do you know what economic turmoil there would be if there was no turmoil in 
[00:55:00]  the in the world we would go broke all our stuff is based on building bombs and missiles and weapons  of mass destruction so why wonderful why wouldn't we be working together as a global society to get  the crazy weapons together to fight the aliens because we hate each other we're we're racists we're  um separatists and uh we don't like each other as as different nations we're chimps basically yeah  yeah we're like dumb chimps not even the smart ones that wear a little engineer outfit 
[00:55:30]  and drive the little train around the little circus love those they're so cute i know ugly without it  but with a little hat on they're adorable you cover up that mandrel ass with a nice little jumper  it's cute to the throwing pudding at your face  they um they would just be a natural human instinct what have people have ever thought of like the big  picture it's like you know you get something you don't know what it is and then you reverse technology  that does make sense yeah but we keep it to yourself see we can't handle not being the top dogs 
[00:56:00]  top top of the food chain you know the big kahuna if you will uh people would freak out if there was  something bigger and better than us we we like thinking there is in some in religion but that's  like this very abstract kind of you know you got to have faith to even believe in it there's an  element of doubt the same thing with ufos as long as there's an element of doubt there where the 
[00:56:30]  skeptics can say no that's not true then people cannot believe it if they choose not to and don't  have to worry about something bigger coming here and kicking our ass uh religion that's something  else a higher power it doesn't you don't get to meet them until after you croak anyway so that  doesn't matter but the the prospect of flying saucers coming down here flying saucers this from 1950  uh coming down here and and aliens that know more than we do are are stronger uh smarter uh freaks us 
[00:57:00]  out how would we deal with being the the puppies of uh some other uh race some other beings we lose  our minds we don't like when a boss tells us what to do imagine some freaking race all of a sudden just  hey you're ours how much would that suck yeah it would suck woke up one day and and said what we're now  second yeah we're second on the food chain so if they want to come and and just like kill us 
[00:57:30]  kill a few of us sure you can't take them to court and arrest them or something you're just at their  mercy right like a like a bug would be when you step on a bug you know you don't go to bug court  you don't have to sit trial in a bug court where bugs will judge you and put you in bug jail you kill  them it doesn't matter and then all of a sudden that's us they they just feel like you know lopping  heads off or hunting us or doing whatever they want you're at their mercy we wouldn't be able to 
[00:58:00]  deal with that if i woke up and found out that i was second on the food chain i would ugly myself up  real fast why is that i would just just so i don't look tasty oh tasty i would just take like  wesson oil and just start rubbing it all over my face hoping that i could get some massive zits  working you'd just see fatties starting to disappear fatties would just be disappearing  grilling them up i would just wash my hair and margarine fatties they'd be called ribeyes yeah 
[00:58:30]  ribeye fatty what would you do though really would you ugly yourself up immediately um i would imagine  that hair can't be fun so i would just grow hair everywhere a lot of hair a lot of hair yes i'm safe  a lot of hair don't wash have a cranky a butt the whole time yeah things like oh that might be a  delicacy for them you don't know yeah they might have some kind of thing like an apple corer where  they just pull out that stinky thing and ah delicious oh you got a nervous one lucky you 
[00:59:00]  it's like scallops to them it's wonderful they try to scare you to get it going yeah get it really  going make your run a little bike seats are mandatory for everyone you have to ride bikes  everywhere in real heavy jeans oh god yeah well that wouldn't be the very good i and i i do think  that's why though if there are and they have kept it secret that's why panic let's go to joe in jersey 
[00:59:30]  joe yeah hey what's going on what's up hey um i got something for you guys you gotta check out a  book called behold the pale horse oh hold on i would like oh i would like to imagine that you're  you're calling your favorite radio show as there's a huge uh you know high-speed chase going on  yeah you have a chase on me well that's what i was getting at sir yeah um behold the pale horse is  about this from this guy from the vietnam era that wrote a book about the government waiting for the 
[01:00:00]  right opportunity to like um for aliens to take over the world pretty interesting uh book he's a  pretty much a nut but uh i would check it out is this fiction or non-fiction i'm not sure conspiracy  theory i'm not sure what that would be considered non-fiction so someone thinks it's uh real all right  thank you sir thank you all right here's more of dr edgar mitchell the astronaut that is uh talking  about aliens his distinguished career as an apollo astronaut makes mitchell one of the most credible 
[01:00:30]  voices ever to enter the alien debate but it will take much more to convince those like don belina  from the foundation for ufo research i am skeptical yeah and that won't change until as they say he backs  it up with something only 12 men ever walked on the moon and having one of them add his voice to a  controversial alien conspiracy theory is potentially embarrassing for nasa the agency will only say 
[01:01:00]  that edgar mitchell remains a great american but nasa does not share his views on aliens and ufos  well they backed right off of that that they made a statement is a little odd but i guess they had to  what i'm gonna say we always know he was an ass yeah this guy was a kook we're hoping to get lost up  there wander off yeah he's been a ship takes off he's just yeah alan shepard says goodbye yeah alan  shepard had distinct orders to point somewhere and tell him to go and hop in the ship in amscray 
[01:01:30]  i'll hold the ship for you yeah uh all right well we'll ask uh who's coming in yeah buzz is coming  in on friday to know what alan shepard's of you uh would have been on that one you know i'm pretty  sure alan shepard's dead right is he alan shepard dead within the past maybe five years  is it i thought he got the big casino  98 98 yeah we're getting more info on behold the pale horse we got uh roger on the opian anthony show 
[01:02:00]  roger yeah hi guys uh that book is mostly um you know if you're into conspiracy literature it's mostly  copied from other sources but uh it's still a good read it's still like a like a reader's digest  version of all the big uh conspiracy theories but uh the guy that wrote it his name was milton  william cooper and he was uh he ran a militia group and he was killed in a shootout with police  uh a couple of weeks after september 11th whoopsie yeah well maybe maybe they wanted to shut him up 
[01:02:30]  yeah you never know i'm sure a lot of people are saying that yeah you can you can ascribe  whatever reason to it uh that you want after the fact it's very convenient that way maybe he  discovered uh that you could run a car on water ah it had nothing to do with anything else get  yourself killed yeah it's a great name for a big fat target on your head behold the thanks guys  all right great name for about you now i was watching jfk this weekend for a few minutes uh the  stone movie and it's just not the same anymore since i've kind of read a lot of other stuff in the 
[01:03:00]  other direction uh-huh it was a lot of fiction in there too you know a lot of his people he put into it  everyone was ominous and in on it yeah ominous that's true there's one scene and you i'll credit  stone with this every total speculative scene was done in black and white right and there's one scene  where the girl is going well i thought i heard a shot from the grass you know and the guy is going  you only heard three shots you only heard three shots and she's like well there was a shot from the 
[01:03:30]  grass you know we're working on that that's been taken care of 20 minutes after the assassination  all of a sudden she's in a room with a man who knew that there was supposed to be three shots  right because he knew there couldn't be why couldn't there be a conspiracy if you're gonna  kill the president why wouldn't they have two guys do it one got caught and got killed one got away  yeah i don't get it there were three shots like everybody knew everybody knew the dallas police  department and the secrets are shut up they didn't all know irritating yeah mighty i gotta watch that 
[01:04:00]  again now in hindsight oh it's funny to watch it's a great movie but yeah it's like everybody's in a  you know literally a thousand people are in on and everybody just kind of keeps under their hats  keep it on the qt yeah the commander-in-chief murdered it's filmed but you know no one says nothing  let's go to pittsburgh ed how are you ed hey what's going on man what's up bro um nothing i'm just  going to tell you guys uh in light of this scientist coming out it kind of runs along the lines of 
[01:04:30]  the rocket scientist warner von braun he pretty much ran nasa until he died in the 70s uh he predicted  back then that he was in a board meeting where they talked about uh warring in the middle east and  then how eventually they would come out and talk about aliens and that would be a cover-up for us  to build up our space defense program our weaponizing of outer space i'm thinking maybe that maybe that  this guy came out not because he's crazy maybe the government told him to so it would kind of give 
[01:05:00]  us a reason to pump up our space program oh there's a nice little conspiracy theory get an astronaut  someone with some credibility talks about the ufos and that way we can uh get our space-based  defense system up and running and i did i did send the link to all this to uh steve c yes were  there any male genitals in it because i just delete anything without that i wish you were but i'm  punching out boys okay all right let's go to clint and this fine city of ours oh let's go local here 
[01:05:30]  clint in new york city what's up clint hey uh first of all i want to uh pay props to jimmy because  he always kind of gets the emotional parts of uh humanity right and uh you know we're progressing  towards appreciating animals we got to think about carl second once you finally talk about chimps  that's a long uh process to get to the point where we appreciate the four chimps  and uh like anthony come on you got all the guns you guys are talking about grand theft auto you're the 
[01:06:00]  one that's afraid but we're working forward people like you come on i mean i think you're really a good  guy you're smart you guys are all funny you attack all the big issues but we're moving forward  that's what we got someone like barack obama george bush these are the afraidy cats carl sagan  talked about this way man i mean are these guys that have mastered getting between stars or planets  or you know we're spinning pros are they really going to come down here and stick little things  up our cuckoos and like do all these silly little things to us or need us for a meet i mean this is  the most cynical i feel like they're listening to a grand theft auto radio station right dude um dude i mean 
[01:06:30]  i know i'm ranting here but it's like yeah but you're you're you're um just as wrong as i could  be by trying to speculate why an alien would come down here in the first place we might be very tasty  or we might uh have some knowledge that they don't you're right but but to be a scaredy cat as you  called me did you call me a scaredy cat come on don't leave me here don't be let's not be chief let's  be honest here what you have to hunt you you're you have to appreciate what technology can do i mean 
[01:07:00]  we're we're at a point we're at a point we're at a point where we're doing so many amazing things in  the universe are they really going to come here to look for meat i mean come on do you think do you  think us launching little things into space uh even comes close to interstellar travel which is  what they would need to get here and and they would look at us like uh uh like equals we would  just be we would be chimps like jimmy said not equals at all curiosities but like are we but we're 
[01:07:30]  but what if we're tasty well no we're we're starting pets are starting to become our our children for  christ's sake i mean we're learning how to appreciate animals this is a curve that's really arising you know  we're learning how to get a hold of our emotions jimmy kind of has it right if you guys at bay with  your like you know the pets are like we're we are chimps for christ's sake so we're still learning to 
[01:08:00]  respect the chromosome or are we going to take it the opposite way well hold on sir not to break up  the role but what dr kaku talks about and my friend dr michael kaku yes talks about like how  if you're the way when we walk by bugs anthony raised the bug example you don't you don't think  about exchanging information with the bug it's just a bug and intellectually if an alien comes  here technologically we really are baboons michael kaku is the most cuckoo one of all he's a bright  guy dude he's a very bright guy michael kaku is not carl sega michael kaku always starts to think 
[01:08:30]  what we're going to do to ourselves he's a michael kaku is fascinated by the problems and he doesn't  want to solve them he's one of the most annoying ones not sure hold on one thing at a time he's not  because he's a guy who's who's a scientist he's a theoretical physicist oh yeah hold on bro hold  on he makes it interesting he gets you interested and he talks about things in a very in a very in  layman's terms where we can kind of understand it and explains things we can understand it he's not 
[01:09:00]  just being some boring scientist you think he can't talk science like just go over our heads of course  i totally disagree michael kaku is not carl segan carl segan made things yeah i know he's not dead  michael kaku billions and billions i wrote i wrote commute what would he write what was the  jody foster movie he wrote contact yes carl segan wrote content yeah yeah so he's speculated about  it come on but no but wait but carl segan there's a there's a whole thing here about when these  theories are so out of control now why isn't stephen hawking's a physical theoretical physicist 
[01:09:30]  wait jimmy come on you're not you're at the door to the discoveries the plasma universe is the real  answer the universe is electrical all these strangers they're all looking to gravity and  gravity is getting us nowhere gravity is serious what do you mean gravity is getting us nowhere it's  kind of keeping us from flying away i like gravity this guy's really dissing gravity  jimmy this is really good stuff you have to ring the big bang never happened get eric lerner on here  well i can't get him on here he never comes out we've asked him 50 times he won't come on 
[01:10:00]  he won't no i've never heard of him that's it well you gotta look eric lerner the big thing  ever happened look up the history of this kind of thinking this kind of singularity thinking what  kind of hold on now we so you got to slow down you what you do is you get on a roll and then you  just kind of run downhill holding a giant rock we got to slow down a little i'm sorry let's start  are you are you a scientist because bichu kaku you can't dismiss him even if you don't agree with  him i agree with you i totally agree you can't dismiss him he's a brilliant dude absolutely what  matter of fact you're totally right we need those kind of people to lead us towards the problem 
[01:10:30]  are you a scientist what what is your scientific background yes my scientific background is  zilch i'm a biologist that went to college i went for like 10 years and i and actually i'm a  costume maker i'm gonna really make it silly you're a costume maker i used to cut david de coveney's  hair i don't i don't want all right okay fair enough obviously qualified to go back and forth  with me show no jimmy jimmy come on let's keep this very real so you're panicking universe is  ninety nine point nine percent plasma i think more than that electrical sprinklers we're not 
[01:11:00]  getting anywhere we're not getting anywhere theoretical stuff that looks for gravity exaggerated  did the company ever ask you to thrust the scissors in his ears you guys you guys are really coming  on the wrong end you're gonna just like you talked about shim ten years down the line you should know  about the wrong end costume maker and a whole cutter  these guys are all right wallace barnhill i mean there's a bunch of guys do you know that paul allen  just gave him half a million dollars to try to get direct electricity from plasma but i heard that 
[01:11:30]  that was the that that was uh uh uh debated and that they decided not to because all of a sudden  he turned around and changed the way he felt yeah paul allen yep isn't he in england  so he pulled out well they still got the money from chile they're still going they're still no  the money from chile dude the money from chile is not coming through oh that's interesting stuff  i have no idea what you're talking about i just made that up i wish you would try to get eric  on here and explain this stuff because his book is so thorough it goes way into history he won't come 
[01:12:00]  on ever since his arrest he's dude ever since his arrest he refuses to do radio yes yes  he was file trading with jeffrey jones they got into his computer and he said they're not kids  they're little aliens and they arrested him yeah well i'm gonna you got you got me there i'm gonna  totally admit it but i think you uh i gotta go do my research but i don't know what you're talking  eric jaylor the physicist you're saying was arrested yes yeah when about uh two weeks ago  and he won't do radio because he has to prepare for his court case and how do you not know that 
[01:12:30]  what the bubba that's what he said what the bubba okay well i guess i have to back off i'm the loser  here and you guys can just continue with the assist thank you you're a good boy take care goodbye to  clint clint was kooky clint's a psychopath i have no idea who eric is i just said he got arrested and  clint was all right i guess you're right yeah you've heard of the guy we got otto from otto and george  uh joining the program next so let's take a quick break we'll continue opie and anthony hey this is  dr michio kaku and you're listening to opie and anthony opie and anthony oh i'm sorry right 
[01:13:00]  hey this is dr michio kaku and you're listening to opie and oh opie opie all right okay opie right  opie right we physicists always pronounce opie because of a famous physicist oppenheimer okay opie  see we didn't know that yeah he built the atomic bomb yeah hey this is dr michio kaku you're listening  to opie and anthony hey this is adam ferrara and august 50th and 60th i will be at governor's in 
[01:13:30]  levittown 516-731-3358 or go to www.govs.com and you can check me out at adamferrara.com  or the myspace come by be my friend  opie and anthony 
[01:14:00]  how's everyone doing today on this monday opie and anthony we got otto from otto and george in  studio he's playing the big comedy show this saturday at the pnc bank art center i'm not  in hondale new jersey what i'm not backing out no no you're not backing out yeah some people have 
[01:14:30]  uh disappointed us this year not happy about that whatsoever yeah not happy whatsoever not happy  but uh what do we got for the tickets jimmy we got a big ticket thing happening tomorrow tomorrow  this is a live nation thing they're offering ten dollar tuesday promotion and uh it's a ten dollar  gross ticket price it's being offered for a bunch of their shows including ours uh ours is not the only  one it's the uh the lawn at pnc and the mezzanine at jones beach blah blah blah but we're only doing the  pnc show for the rest of the stuff who cares yeah who cares who gives a flying fudge oh come on 
[01:15:00]  what i say come on we don't watch it easy all over easy the headlines easy if you want to go to our  show ten dollars i don't know tickets tomorrow but then when the service charges uh you know  strangled you to death it'll probably be 78 i don't know gross ticket price might not be it might  just be ten dollars yeah that would be that would be crazy i don't know i should be informed i hope  it's not as hot as last year remember that the day the last pnc show was was sweltering it's really 
[01:15:30]  bad right horrible i hope it is because my first five minutes is boy it's hot in here and then when  they yell how hot is it i have a funny answer oh god jimmy that's a funny bit yeah hey um uh i gotta  bring this up uh it's a little sore spot with you three guys oh no the last time i was on we had that  conversation about steve martin's pink panther sucking royally right and then the next day you  had mike myers on you brought that up to him and he was like oh i think he's a genius everything he 
[01:16:00]  does is just all so wonderful and you guys were all like real contrite and you i mean i thought one  of you would just go shut up it's stunk you're wrong i mean i mean this is not politics this is  radio you're supposed to have your opinion you know i well there's a reason for that there's a reason  for that okay we're fags oh i think i mean i know you don't want to lose future guests by being  you know brutal and you're correct yeah no we were star i was at home cringing i'm going what's wrong  with that we were starstruck you were yeah i can't argue mike myers is pretty big i think i think we got 
[01:16:30]  i think we got a bit starstruck when he came in he was a little boring he's a major star and all but  still you're entitled to your opinion yeah you're right i should have smashed him but we didn't agree with  them yeah nah but we we we backed off we backed off i shouldn't i didn't you you might have said  a little more than these other two i said that the uh arrow thing through his head was always  genius and very funny and then uh my uh it was almost like here's why i did i remember i was angry 
[01:17:00]  but it was almost like he didn't bring steve martin up yeah i did i think to get him into it yeah  and he's like oh i just like him he's great and then i'm like no wrong or some something like that  and then i'm like what am i gonna do just like start going no that movie sucks and he's just gonna  go all right yeah yeah it was pointless because it wasn't like he brought it up um to be confrontational  he didn't he was just plugging his own movie yeah so it's almost like if i was on a radio show and  someone said well auto is or bash one of my friends and i'm like no i like them and then they just 
[01:17:30]  started to trash them yeah for what right well put it this way if steve martin came in here and brought  up uh the love guru we would say that movie sucked you would yeah yeah because it that came and went  oh wow well why do you think he was on our show yeah we don't get uh a list celebrities unless  they're they desperately need the help project yeah we never he wasn't coming around for the austin  powers movies oh god let's just put it this way we didn't get we didn't get one person from dark  night because they didn't need the help yeah but if the the early reviews were shaky trust me they 
[01:18:00]  would have been marching through that door but we got david dukovni for the x-files movie and well  you could always tell boy you could always tell if a movie's gonna tank don't come on our  show if i was an actor i would never come on our show it means your movie's gonna tank we finally  got uh willem dafoe oh he's for that garbage he was in what was he in a platoon  that garbage you you know the movie's gonna be bad if you can't even you can't even pronounce the  name of the movie yeah yeah it was anamomophobic or something it was yeah anamorphic or some 
[01:18:30]  stupidity you know if you want to get word of mouth out there you really got to make sure people  you know could say the name of your movie i saw this movie what was it uh it was  yeah what are you going to see tonight i'm going to see i'm a nannanama like they got it right with  the batman because i think they think that some people can't even like uh pronounce batman right  so they go uh dark knight because everyone can relate to a dark knight right it's dark  and it's night time. That movie. 
[01:19:00]  That's what I saw. Not Adam  for Rick. There hasn't been a movie  in this a long time that's been this across  the boards loved by everybody that's  seen it, right? Yeah. Yeah. Heath Ledger was  good. I mean, everybody says it, but he was good. I rooted for him to be  bad. Yeah. So I could be the different guy.  Yeah. But you can't not like what he did.  Wow. New conspiracy theory.  Faked his own death. Oh,  please. Yeah, he's going to pop up with  all the rest of them. It's got legs.  They're starting. There's some chatter  saying that he faked his own death.  Death to really get the box office 
[01:19:30]  receipts up there. Oh, really?  This movie would not have done as well if he didn't die.  You know, I really honestly  wish a celebrity would do that at some  point. Would a celebrity really  fake his own death and  do it right? I bet you they're trying to figure out how they  could get away with that, but that stupid  corner gets in the way.  Yes.  Because they need to see the dumb body. He wasn't  dead. He was talking, Sam.  This  isn't the right body.  This isn't his legend. He was a young 
[01:20:00]  man in the prime of his life.  This man is 67 years  old. I don't know, Quince.  What's the problem, Detective Monaghan?  Detective Monaghan always  wanted to cut corners, but Quincey was...  I love it.  A beautiful  girl.  Girl.  Murder.  Murder.  Murder.  He was Rod Serling's favorite actor.  He did four Twilight Zones.  Yeah.  Yeah, he was like the everyman.  Yeah, it was the one with the shoot in the pool. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, the pool one.  And then there was the one with Pip.  Passage for the trumpet.  This little kid.  And praise of Pip.  And he did one of the crappy hour-long ones.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Those were unwatchable.  They only show those during the marathons.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, wrap it up in a half hour.  You don't need an hour to, you know, that stuff.  An hour.  Yeah.  And some of them were done live, which is really weird when you see those.  Oh, when they tried to save money and they used that kinescope.  Yeah, yeah.  It didn't look right.  Looks real weird.  They were trying to save like 80 bucks or something.  80 bucks.  Yeah, it looked...  Rod cut out like 10 minutes of smoking.  You'll save 80 bucks. 
[01:21:00]  And a couple of them were really good episodes.  The Art Carney Santa Claus one was shot in that style.  It didn't look right.  What do you mean live?  I think the one with...  It was done on kinescope.  So they would...  Somebody would, I guess, have a 16 millimeter camera filming it off of a monitor or something.  And instead of actually shooting it on film, directly on film.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was some weird save a few dollar thing.  The one with Anthony.  The one with Bill...  Little William Mooney. 
[01:21:30]  Right, right.  With the downed power line.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And a lot of the old honeymooners, the ones that aren't the classic 39 are the same thing.  They look like...  Yeah.  They look awful.  The kinescopes are awful.  Yeah.  They are.  Let's set up a camera in front of a television set.  Yeah.  Instead of just getting direct.  Now we got digital.  Yeah.  So I did the Montreal Festival.  I got to hang with Patrice for a week.  And, you know, he was on the second half of the show.  And, you know, he would come in like when the show was halfway over and plop down with  his foot-long subway sandwich and just shove it into his face like a big black wood chipper with Dobbs hat on. 
[01:22:00]  And then these English douchebag comedians kept crashing the dressing room.  I mean, I can't stand the English attitude of comedy.  Like, I was saying how much I love Benny Hill.  Oh, you like Benny Hill?  He's bloody awful.  What's wrong with you?  Benny Hill sucked.  Yeah.  Just because he's a million times more famous than you could ever hope to be.  And he was, you know, in every country.  What's wrong with Benny Hill?  Some English comics can be funny, but it's almost like I haven't seen any of them. 
[01:22:30]  Their pomposity is nauseous.  It's enraging.  Because I haven't seen one of them that touched socially anything that, like, Pryor did or anything.  No, no, no.  It's all wordplay.  And, you know, I'll have a go at him, mate.  You know, and it's all that type stuff.  Maybe there are some I haven't seen.  It's funny when you do it.  Yeah.  I'll have a go at him, mate.  Yeah, that's kind of good.  I've been doing something like that.  Yeah, why not?  He has his impressions.  You'd think he's really British.  Yeah.  So, yeah, I hated that. 
[01:23:00]  This guy, Brendan something or other.  Oh, and then he's talking to Patrice.  I was trying to just stay to myself in the dressing room because it was three shows a night.  It's very hard for me not to drink between shows.  So I was, like, reading a book on the side.  And the guy, what's his name?  Guy Ritchie came up.  So this guy goes, yeah, I'm in this Guy Ritchie movie.  He goes, oh, I didn't even see it.  I was like, what?  You were in a movie?  You didn't even see it?  Shut up, you egomaniac.  Benny Hill is much funnier than you.  Well, he probably thought he was intriguing. 
[01:23:30]  Like, Spencer Tracy would never watch his own movies.  So this guy probably thought he was interesting.  It's Spencer Tracy.  Exactly.  Overrated.  I'm sure that's the cool thing to say, though.  I'm in a movie, but I didn't see it.  Didn't like the old man in the sea?  Hollywood, yeah.  I didn't see it.  I saw that.  Yeah.  I just saw Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.  Oh, boy.  Mad Mad World?  Oh, yes.  Yeah, he was getting that.  Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.  Mad Mad Parent.  So, Otto, going backwards a little bit, so you haven't seen The Dark Knight yet?  I went to the theater, and they said the 615 is sold out, 645 is available, but the air 
[01:24:00]  conditioning sucked, and it was on a really bad day, so I just got my money back.  It's like, I wanted to be in a cool theater.  I didn't want to suffer to see this thing, you know?  You know what?  You've got to wait and see it on the IMAX, though.  Yeah, to see it on an amazing screen.  And I heard that's been sold out for three weeks or something like that.  The IMAX is in Midtown here, right?  Yeah, 68th and Broadway.  Yeah, I don't mean to get local here, but is that a great theater?  Yeah, it's fantastic.  That was amazing.  That's where we saw it.  Yeah.  How big is the screen?  It's gigantic.  It's 20 feet. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, about 20 feet across.  20 feet.  It's almost like you get nauseous.  The opening scene is like you're flying through the city, like, oh, you know, the overshot of  it.  Yeah.  And you really do feel like you're moving.  I forgot that they do that with a large screen.  But we were a little too close for all the fight scenes.  You want to be farther back because when the fight scenes are shot really quickly and you  can't even make out what's going on.  It's just like, big arm, fist, head, back.  No, but that's the new thing they're doing with these action movies is filming the fight  scenes way too close.  That was originally, I think the first movie that really was popular that did that was 
[01:25:00]  Gladiator.  Gladiator.  Where they really start, Ridley Scott, yeah.  But now everyone does it.  Yeah, now it's, I mean, they were, and that was pretty graphic, but it wasn't very detailed  as far as being able to see a lot of the fight scenes.  You know, they'd show a leg or head being chopped off, stuff like that, but.  Too much quick cutting.  Yeah, I don't like that shaky, very shaky camera kind of, you know, they do it in post  too, so it's digital shake.  Let me see the special effect.  Even if it sucks, I still want to see it. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah.  You can go, you know, oh, that didn't look real, you know, something.  And, yeah, that's why I just like, you know, I like seeing action sequences.  Yeah.  Action sequence.  Not a lot of special effects in Dark Knight.  Is that right?  Not a lot of CGI and all that.  Not a lot, man.  Yeah.  Not a big fan.  What's his name?  The director there.  I forgot his name.  Oliver Stone?  And all that.  Oliver Stone.  I got cancer in the neck.  I've had it for years. 
[01:26:00]  All right, we got Otto from Otto and George.  We're going to take a quick break here and catch up a little bit.  But Otto's playing the big comedy show this Saturday, PNC Bank Arts Center.  And speaking of which, you better get ready to text because we're giving people a chance  to win a car.  And Otto has another show August 7th, which is five days after, but it's in Staten Island.  So, you know.  Yeah, all my Brooklyn and Staten Island people must attend the St. George Theater.  It's on Hyatt Street in Staten Island.  And you can go to OttoandGeorge.com.  It's literally a block from the Staten Island Ferry, so, you know, you could take a ride 
[01:26:30]  on a boat after or before or whatever, you know, stab somebody with a bayonet and run  amok.  Remember that guy?  Yeah.  Remember that guy?  I'm giving fencing lessons on the Staten Island Ferry.  Yeah, boy.  Yeah, boy.  So, A-Rod slept with Madonna.  Before that, Charles Barkley.  And before that, Dennis Rodman.  She's going to wind up with Athlete's Cunt.  Whoa! 
[01:27:00]  That's one of those gray areas they talk about.  Oh, Jesus.  I go, it's connected, eh?  I should have delivered it like Bob Hall.  I was going to say pussy, but then I'd be whipping out.  Okay.  Oh, wow.  Always exciting when Otto stops by the Opie and Anthony show before break.  I miss getting dumped.  Those old NEW days were great.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  They dumped you, trust me.  The XMers heard it.  Okay.  We go to break with the FU line. 
[01:27:30]  Stay there.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony FU line.  Here's the latest batch of FUs.  You have six new voice messages.  First voice message.

[01:29:30]  Opie, Anthony, Otto from Otto and George playing the big comedy show this Saturday at the PNC Bank Art Center.  Tickets through Ticketmaster, Ticketmaster.com.  Tomorrow, $10 tickets going on sale.  Tomorrow only, I believe, right?  Yeah, it's some weird thing Live Nation is doing.  You go to LiveNation.com and it's $10 lawn seats. 
[01:30:00]  They say it's a gross ticket price.  I don't know what that means.  If that means everything included.  I can't say.  I just, I don't know.  Someone should have gotten to us with that.  All right.  And Otto wants us to promote his little short film.  Yeah.  Otto and George meet Jesus on YouTube.  Is that how they were playing?  Otto and George meets Jesus.  Yeah, just punch that in.  Yes.  We got it up right now.  It's pretty disturbing.  What is this about?  Uh, it's a dream sequence where George and Jesus beat off on the kitchen floor together  and then George has a run-in with some Jehovah's Witnesses and pelts them in the face with 
[01:30:30]  anthrax.  It's pretty good, though.  Some of that got dumped out, but let's just say George and who?  Jesus.  Yeah.  Let's just say this.  They sit on the floor.  The Son of God.  They engage in an activity you'd normally engage in alone.  Yeah.  And then Jehovah's Witnesses show up and George pelts them with anthrax.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I see your interpretation of Jesus as a big, fat guy.  He's a freshing Jesus.  Yeah.  Yeah.  With an eating disorder.  One of the lines, he goes, the buffets in heaven are amazing. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, God.  All right.  Because I guess that wasn't the last supper after all.  I don't know if we hear any of the dialogue.  I, uh, we're, we're, we're, we're at the part of the short film where Jesus just pulled,  uh, George's, pulled George's pants down.  Yeah.  We can say that.  You're missing all the dialogue, though.  It's like the, yeah.  I imagine it's not radio friendly.  I would think.  Yeah.  All right.  So we'll check that out.  Otto and George meets Jesus on YouTube. 
[01:31:30]  He's another comic.  That's Glenn Miller.  He calls himself Satan's comic.  So it was, it was so funny casting him as Jesus.  Cause all he's got is devil stuff all over his car.  Oh, really?  He's a real, you know, dark character.  Why?  Why devil stuff on the car?  He just likes to get a reaction out of people.  He really isn't a devil worshiper or nothing like that.  Big horns on the roof.  A little tail on the back.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  That's cool.  Oh my God.  This guy's devilish.  Get out of his way.  He'll be talking about the devil.  Yeah. 
[01:32:00]  Does his act have devil stuff in it?  Sorry.  No, go, Jimmy.  Not really.  No.  Okay.  He's a one liner guy.  He's very, very good writer.  Okay.  As soon as something happens in the news, he's got like 30 jokes.  Two Jews walk into a bar.  They have cloven hooves.  Take my wife to hell.  All devil jokes.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Here's George throwing the anthrax in the faces of the Jehovah Witnesses.  Wow.  He had a big handful, didn't he?  Yeah.  I love anthrax because nobody really knows what it looks like. 
[01:32:30]  So we just used flour and just pelted the actors in the face with flour.  Or, you know, first you wet their face a little bit so it would stick.  Yeah.  Just a poof.  And we dubbed in a karate kick from a Bruce Lee movie for the impact of the anthrax hitting  him in the ice.  I can't wait to watch that.  Pretty cool.  What do you think of Obama?  He's another lying prick politician.  I don't think much of any of these people, really. 
[01:33:00]  Nah, he's too weird.  The name is too weird.  We need an American name.  Really do, you know?  Well, who's not going to sit well with anyone?  He's black.  He's got an Arab name.  People really blew over that whole middle name being Hussein thing.  Yeah.  Like, they kind of really...  And his camp is just as guilty, I mean, of kind of blowing that over.  Yeah, he could easily be the Antichrist.  It was always George W. Bush.  You know, W, W, George W, George W.  It's like, his middle name's Hussein. 
[01:33:30]  Now, does that mean anything?  Of course not.  I mean, the nicest guy in the world, his middle name could be Hussein.  But in that awful part of the world, everyone's name is Hussein, and they're all awful people.  So it kind of has this negative connotation to it.  That's all I'm saying.  Where did he come from?  I mean, mayor of something or what?  He was a politician and senator in Chicago, in Illinois, and he made a speech at the Democratic National Convention a few years ago. 
[01:34:00]  And that's what kind of made him national, where everybody kind of knew who he was.  He had a good speech.  Great, yeah.  Everybody kind of like, well, this guy has great ideas.  He's young.  Whatever.  They just like his voice.  That good speaking thing just gets you elected.  What is he going to do once he's elected?  I mean, is he going to be able to run stuff?  You know?  I don't know.  Yeah.  This is history.  It's funny that Otto brings that up, because it's leading to where I want to go.  A lot of people are saying they're not voting for Obama because he's inexperienced.  Yeah.  We're learning today that when people say that they're not voting for Obama because he's inexperienced, 
[01:34:30]  what they're basically saying is that they're not voting for him because he's black.  Oh.  Right, Stump Brain?  Yep.  What do we know on that?  There was a...  Because that's the safe way for people to say, look, I don't want to vote for the guy because  he's inexperienced.  But they really want to say because he's black.  There was a pollster who was saying they were trying to investigate why people weren't voting  for Obama, and they kept probing behind the inexperienced thing, and the people finally  said, well, it's basically because he's black.  So the new code word for saying they're not voting for someone because they're black is 
[01:35:00]  inexperienced.  And they said it's a huge factor out there because they don't know just how big the inexperience  factor is going to be.  Sure.  Isn't he one of the monkeys that sprayed Frank Vincent's car with the fire hydrant to do  the right thing, though?  Flooded his...  No?  Who?  Who's that face?  Well, we're a bit sensitive around here these days.  Otto's wondering that.  Yeah.  Here's a...  Who doesn't get a paycheck from CBS radio? 
[01:35:30]  No?  Okay.  No.  Here's the problem with his name.  This is why they said George W.  Yeah.  It was distinguished from his father.  That was why the W got...  Because you already had a George Bush...  Bill Clinton's name, nobody knows his middle name.  Or nobody...  Jefferson.  It was used all the time.  William Jefferson Clinton.  No, but when you said...  People knew it because it was...  But everyone knew it, and it was used a lot of times because his hero was Thomas Jefferson,  his ascension to the presidency.  It was William Jefferson... 
[01:36:00]  Especially during the campaigning, it was constantly William Jefferson Clinton.  Not when he got into office, but...  It sounds presidential.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it was.  You know, Barack Hussein Obama is not something that Americans want to hear as being their president.  Well, Americans should shut their faces.  If they don't like the guy and they don't want to vote for him, that's fine.  If you think he stinks, don't vote for him.  But if they're actually caught up in the fact that his father gave him a name that happens  to be associated with it, then the people are moron. 
[01:36:30]  Middle Eastern terrorists and dictators.  It doesn't matter, though.  I mean, it's like, you know, what else could he name a thing?  Shecky Mussolini would be a little...  Yeah.  How about Hitler?  It's like, Bob Hitler wants to be president.  I think the name might get in the way.  Maybe, but that was...  Don't forget, he was named before Saddam Hussein was a problem, and when this happened, we  weren't having conflicts with radical Islam.  When he was named, they were fine.  Yeah.  There was no problem.  No.  Can you imagine if in 1930 you were born and your name was Ted Hitler or Ted Hitler Jones.  I'm Ted Hitler. 
[01:37:00]  I'm Ted Hitler Jones.  The Ted and the Jones part are the good parts.  I don't know.  Just like, there was such a beef about Kennedy being Irish Catholic, and every other president  was a Protestant.  Now, all of a sudden, we just, come one, come all?  Come on.  Yeah.  Well, you like McCain?  I think there should be rigid guidelines.  It should be these angry old white men should be the president.  It's worked so far.  Yeah, look.  So you like McCain?  We've been inventing stuff.  Yeah, McCain, absolutely.  We've been inventing stuff.  Yeah.  World leader kind of a thing. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  It's kind of worked.  People are like, oh, what another old white guy in there?  It's like, oh, look at the country.  We're not a third world nation yet.  We're an old white guy.  But old white guys have kind of done pretty good as far as the country goes.  Sorry.  Yeah.  Sorry.  To me, the way they're looking at things when they're a certain age is becoming a little  bit dated.  Especially with energy and stuff like that, I'm tired of hearing about their awful, antiquated  views on energy.  The only thing with old guys is they don't care so much if the world blows up because they're 
[01:38:00]  checking out soon enough.  That's one thought that you should consider, I guess.  Yeah, McCain's a great guy, but he's 71.  And look, I'm being ageist, but I don't want that one to someone that old.  You're ageist?  Yeah.  Old people bug me.  Yeah.  Sick of looking at them.  Yeah.  I always keep a lot of change with me.  Let me see.  I think I have the exactor.  The change purse?  Yeah.  I can't get that.  You always get behind that lady online at the supermarket.  I always have pennies.  73 cents. 
[01:38:30]  I think I have it.  Can you wait a moment?  You're like, oh my God.  See, this is a Nick guy.  Nick online, too?  Sure.  This is one of these stats that have come up.  Nick!  Yeah, how you doing, guys?  How you doing, man?  What do you got?  I just wanted to take Opie's little research to task, because they did some research, and  they said that 97% of the blacks are voting for Obama.  Sir, can you do me?  Hold on, hold on.  You crapped out for a second. 
[01:39:00]  Hang up your iPhone and call us on your home phone.  97% of blacks say they're voting for Obama.  Yeah, but...  And only 1% are saying they're voting for McCain.  Now, doesn't that mean...  That isn't racism.  Yeah.  I don't know what it is.  Doesn't that mean that the 97% of blacks say they're not voting for a white guy?  That's pretty much it.  I don't want to vote for the guy because he's white.  I'd rather vote for a guy that looks like me in skin color.  Yeah, but I play devil's advocate here, being the bleeding heart that I'm turning into. 
[01:39:30]  I would make myself sick.  Yeah.  But there's never been one.  If I was black...  If you're black, and unless the guy's a lunatic, you're going to vote for a black president,  or you're an idiot.  It's racist.  It's not racist, though.  It is absolutely racist.  That's not...  It's not done to be...  Something that's racist is done to have harmful effects.  To me, wanting to see a black president, because you've never seen one, and because of the  history they have there, is not...  It's not a racist...  But it's racial. 
[01:40:00]  But it's not racist.  Racist is done to be awful.  That thing is racist.  Everybody...  Hold on, hold on.  I'm being a what?  You're being a jackass, Jim.  So you don't see any...  Hold on.  You don't see any validity to that at all?  No, no.  I see validity, because I think it would be great for some of the great black people  out there to get a black president so they could stop it, stop being disenfranchised.  But you're just...  You just take all the racism out of blacks, because they have no power. 
[01:40:30]  Have you ever listened to this radio show?  I take all the racism.  Are you out of your mind?  No, Jim.  I listen to the show...  You're a dummy, then.  ...on replays.  You're a dummy, then.  So really?  So I don't call blacks out on their racism like when I attacked Whoopi and all the rappers  for attacking Imus?  Really?  I don't call blacks out on racism?  Jesse Jackson for dropping the N-bomb?  Or his hypocrisy for saying, Hi-Me-Town?  Or the way Sharpton said white interlopers?  Really, you dummy?  I don't call blacks out for racism?  Jim, most of the time you make excuses for them. 
[01:41:00]  Never.  You are a stupid ass.  You're an ass.  I'm much smarter than you, Jim.  Yeah, really?  That's why you're calling up saying that Barack gets racist if they vote for Barack.  Shut up.  No.  They are racist.  Shut up.  I'm not saying that some of them aren't racist, but voting for Barack because you want to see  a black president is not racist.  You're not smarter than me.  Or you'd be on the radio instead of calling in on a crappy cell phone.  I'm calling from Iowa.  That's why, Jim.  Then you are dumber than me, or you'd know to move to New York. 
[01:41:30]  Iowa stinks.  You're not smart.  Go eat corn.  We don't even have to wash our corn here.  That's how great Iowa is.  Iowa stinks.  One match would wipe your state out.  Stop saying Jim and stepping on the laughs, you idiot.  God almighty, are you a bore.  Dude, I don't want comedy here.  I want to make my point.  Shut up, you Midwestern rube.  Shut your face.  Go squat thrust over an ear of corn. 
[01:42:00]  Every time you do what you do, you make the comedy because you're a good one.  Because it's a comedy show, you ass.  I'm a comedian.  Well then, stop trying to make points, idiot.  I make points and I do comedy.  You do neither.  You sit in Iowa in your stupid little sheltered environment and you look at the corn grow and  that's what you do.  Mother, this ear really sprouted up from last week.  Everyone's laughing at you, stupid.  Shut up.  No, you're laughing at me because you're an idiot.  Yeah, you're an idiot. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, you always make excuses for them, Jim.  All I do is point out, shut your mouth, you stepping on everything idiot.  Does nobody listen to you in Iowa?  You just stand in the barn and talk to the bird droppings on the wall.  I wish somebody would hear me, little white things on the wall.  You're a piece of garbage.  Yeah, then stop listening.  Then stop listening.  You're a self-hating white man.  Oh my God, are you a little, you're just, are you out of your mind? 
[01:43:00]  What's the matter?  What's the matter, pal?  Did your girlfriend open her legs for a black guy?  Is that the problem?  What's the matter?  Did your mother or your sister lay down with a dark fella and that's kind of got to you?  Is that what happened?  Huh?  You were dating a girl, you hillbilly, and all of a sudden she hooked up with one of the  basketball players and she really did never come back?  Huh?  What's that?  Did she walk in with her legs kind of broken from the good deep you-know-what?  And he gave her?  Shut your mouth.  Shut up, self-hating white man.  Stop throwing around phrases that you heard. 
[01:43:30]  Stop throwing around phrases you heard, you hick, you corn-eating hick.  You're a self-hating white man and I feel good about myself.  Shut your mouth.  You sit there with a bunch of boring white guys on forklifts.  Shut up.  I have to work with those you-know-whats.  You're nothing but a parrot.  You're a parrot?  Yeah, I'm going to parrot.  Matt, you're boring.  Matt?  Matt?  Parrot?  You know why?  Because you're a parrot from New Brunswick.  I'm from North Brunswick.  Okay, because I know, and I grew up right around from where you live. 
[01:44:00]  Then why'd you move to Iowa, guy who's smarter than me?  I'm from Iowa, listen!  Okay, why'd you move to Iowa?  Why'd you move to Iowa?  I'm a truck driver.  I'm driving through Iowa.  Where do you live?  I live in New Jersey.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I know you don't care.  But the self-hating white man thing, for you to think that, all kidding aside.  Everybody says that.  It's not just me.  Who says that?  Everybody, who do you talk to?  You on the CB? 
[01:44:30]  You think he's a self-hating white man?  Good buddy, 10-4.  What's your handle?  What's your handle?  Proud retard?  Shut your mouth.  I don't have a CB.  Of course you don't have a CB, because nobody wants to talk to you.  Nobody except for you guys, because I talk to you all the time.  Yeah, but I'm a self-hating white man.  Hey man, thanks for carrying the pride flag.  You're right, I'm really self-hating.  You're a good point.  You're a dummy.  I love the show, guys.  Obviously, you listen to it all the time.  Every day, and on replays.  I have to agree with Nick on this one, Jim. 
[01:45:00]  See, really?  Take care, guys.  There goes Nick.  I hope you hit a pulse, stupid.  I hope you take a swig of whiskey and hit a pole, and your proud white face goes through  it, and then you're white and red because you're bleeding from the scalp.  Fucking asshole!  Whoa!  Oh, damn!  Jim got mad.  Yeah, Jim got mad on that one.  I don't care if he disagrees with me, but that annoys me so much.  Some of the perception is that wrong.  Jimmy is the furthest thing from a self-hating white man. 
[01:45:30]  It's like you're just a dummy.  Jimmy is just as racist as me.  Well, that's real skinhead rhetoric, that self-hating white man thing, isn't it?  But it's almost like there are people that would apply to.  Yeah.  But I call, to me, one of my biggest issues is how blacks are not held to the same racial  standards by elitist whites.  Yeah.  And for this dummy to think that because I'm saying, well, just not voting, wanting to  see Barack as president if you're black is not being hateful.  It's understandable in a way. 
[01:46:00]  For this idiot, who probably doesn't deal with many black people, to say that I'm a self-hating  white man, it's stupid.  Yeah.  Let's go to John in Florida.  John?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I hope this call goes well.  Me too.  Sorry for the yelling guys.  Your lips turned color.  You got so mad.  I really did.  Because I don't care if a guy just disagrees with my point, but that guy, I hated.  I listen every day and on replay.  You had purple swimming pool lips for a second.  Luke Costello kid lips.  Oh, God.  Damn. 
[01:46:30]  Sorry, man.  I'm just a self-hating white man.  White baby died.  I'm happy.  Go ahead.  Oh, shit.  Well, he's proud.  He's proud of his white.  It's good for you, kid.  Good for you.  Oh, sorry.  That's all right.  John in Florida.  What's up?  You guys, a lot of people say that, you know, Barack should be president because of his lack  of experience.  And I look at it from the opposite.  Look with these old white people with the economy, the gas price.  Let a new guy get in there.  You know, black or white.  He's young.  He's new.  He's charismatic. 
[01:47:00]  Let him take a shot at it.  See if he can't do better than these old guys.  You honestly think old white guy is the reason that the prices go up?  And look through history.  You remember through the 70s, there was a giant gas crisis.  The prices were ridiculous then, relatively speaking.  You had to wait on lines that were a mile long to get to a gas station.  Odd and even numbered license plates on odd and even days.  It was a catastrophe.  And then things get better because everything is cyclical. 
[01:47:30]  The whole idea of things changing from placing another guy in there is a sham and an illusion.  Nothing is going to change.  The rich, rich white people run everything.  And you're a self-hating white man.  And none of these politicians ever keep their promises anyway.  So why does everybody buy into this thing?  Oh, it's going to be different this time.  Your vote is completely meaningless.  The only way to get change is revolution.  Storm the castle and slit everyone's throat. 
[01:48:00]  That's the only way there's ever been any change throughout history.  You don't vote.  Everything's changed.  You know.  I see your point, but I really think...  Revolution, it's called.  Yeah, let's do a revolution.  No, you've got to decapitate a lot of people to get changed.  You don't just vote them out.  But even now, I mean, the gas price of the economy is bad because of the war.  Why not get someone in that wants to talk and use diplomacy and not use diplomacy at the end of a gun and go there and start, you know, shooting people? 
[01:48:30]  I know.  His hair beads up when he goes swimming.  I can't have it.  The point that annoys me is all these people that won't talk to Ahmadinejad because, you know, they're like, we're not going to talk to...  That I've had enough of.  I think the guy...  Look, I'd love to see the guy catch a bullet.  I'd love to see the Iranian president taken out with his stupid Robert De Niro face.  Sure.  I would love to see it.  But I'm sick and tired of... 
[01:49:00]  We're not going to talk to...  Why?  Why aren't we going to talk to him just because he's not doing what we don't want him to do?  Why shouldn't we?  Ronnie Reagan was from the same kind of school of thought there.  He didn't speak with those people.  He bombed them.  Yeah.  That's what he did.  And they shut their mouths.  Yeah, but we're not going to bomb them enough.  We're not going to do that.  We're going to bomb them and then apologize and go, oh, we're sorry.  We shouldn't have done that.  And then we're going to kind of keep sending troops in.  But make sure not to kill civilians.  We're not going to do it right.  Yeah, I know.  See, we need someone with some bulls in there.  If Scatman Crud is still alive, he'd be good.  He's dead. 
[01:49:30]  He's dead.  Is that an ice cream doc?  Doc?  Let's go to Crescent, Connecticut.  Chris?  I need a snowcat.  Hey, Chris.  What's going on with all the fear here, man?  People like Anthony, what are you guys so afraid of?  You know, I mean, white guy, black guy.  It's all going to be the same.  I have voiced my concerns over this entire campaign, Chris.  You didn't hear me?  This fear?  You're trying to label me as being afraid of a black president.  When I'm not, I'm afraid of a left-wing liberal president that's going to tax the living crap out of me. 
[01:50:00]  When I already pay much too much in tax money.  Who's going to infringe further on my Second Amendment right to own firearms.  And who's going to take money and pretty much socialize the country.  That's my fear.  I don't care if he's blue.  You kind of do, though, Ed.  Nothing is going to change.  Nothing is going to change.  Oh, really?  Maybe a Democratic president with a Democratic Congress and nothing's going to change? 
[01:50:30]  Things can change.  I understand what Otto was saying before about this massive change.  It's not going to be this, you know, either it's going to be a great place to live or a crap hole.  Things don't change like that.  But I'll tell you what can change.  Taxes.  Real quick.  And you're right to bear arms.  That crap changes really fast.  Well, the conservatives haven't been very good for radio.  I'll say that.  I'll agree with you.  But neither have the Democrats.  No one's coming out and saying we want people to be able to say this on the radio. 
[01:51:00]  It's all this cop-out to get the polls up for themselves by saying I'm here for the children.  So the parents will vote for you.  It doesn't matter what.  That's the one thing these idiots can agree on is that we suck.  That's pretty much all the Republicans and Democrats can agree on is that everyone in radio blows.  He's going to be the next president.  Yeah, I said he was.  I know.  He's going to be the next president.  You've got to see him in Berlin.  You've got to see all the people in the whole world just worshiping this guy because that's who they want.  Hey, I want to go to this Berlin thing. 
[01:51:30]  I'm hearing a lot of those people went to the Obama thing because there was bands playing.  Yeah, like what bands were playing that 200,000 people would show up for?  They still aren't booing them.  But supposedly he was, you know, they got the people there because of bands.  I need to know what bands.  I just think it's time to get used to the fact that he's going to be the next president.  Get over it.  All right, Chris, thanks.  Let's go to Jess and get over it.  Why don't you suck?  And you know what? 
[01:52:00]  Get over it.  I just explained my frigging point.  And this guy's get over it.  We're all in it.  I can't stand people.  It's a bad topic.  Ugh.  Now, but it's not even a political disagreement.  It's disgust me.  It's the douches behind the political.  I said what I said.  Ugh.  Everybody's got their little opinion.  They stand by it.  This is why I hate that trucker's guts, for real.  Because when you say something like, you always make excuses for them. 
[01:52:30]  And it's like, you're out of your...  Like, that's the last thing I do.  All I talk about is how the media doesn't cover the hate crimes the same way, and how  black or white crime is never considered racial.  Like, I've said that into the...  Obviously, it's redundant.  I beat it into the ground.  And then, because I'm making a point that this dummy doesn't agree with, he calls up with  that, and he just starts to lie.  He's a liar.  Self-hating white guy.  Let's do one more call before the break.  Jess in Jersey.  What's up, Jess?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  You know who throws that phrase around? 
[01:53:00]  Emasculated, eunuch white guys.  Oh.  You're a self-hating white man.  Like, they're carrying the flag.  Like, they're proud.  Yeah.  And anybody who looks at it, like, well, maybe that's not completely the way it should  be.  I don't go around thinking of myself as a white man.  I'm just, you know, Otto, a guy, you know?  I don't think of myself as a white man.  I just think of myself as good.  Wake up in the morning and go, boy, I'm glad I'm white still, you know?  You're Otto.  Who thinks like that?  Let's go to Jess in Jersey.  Jess.  Hi.  How's it going?  Hey, Jess.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, madam. 
[01:53:30]  Hey, don't you think that rather than being racist, that most of the black people that  say they're voting for Obama is more on a level of ignorance?  What do you mean?  And bad tippers.  Ignorance, what do you mean?  The fact that they're saying, oh, we're just going to vote for Obama because he's black,  well, that's more of an ignorant statement than racist.  But it's not like he's black and nuts.  It's like he's a viable candidate.  You understand?  If they were voting for him... 
[01:54:00]  He's not black, really.  Yeah, but I mean, you know, he's the first black candidate.  The same people cheered when OJ was acquitted, even knowing that he was guilty just because  he's black.  And the excuse was, well, we finally got to win one.  Oh, we did?  Really?  The rich guy that shunned the black community for his entire professional life?  He's one of yours?  Yeah.  Just based purely on the color of his skin?  Right.  If there's one race that bases things so purely on skin color, where Martin Luther King 
[01:54:30]  had said, you know, to not base it on skin color, but base it on content to character.  If there's one race of people that bases things solely on skin color the majority of  the time, it's black people.  Yeah.  They do.  I'm getting mad.  What about the fact that he's been raised by a white family?  Miss, if black people want to see a black president, I don't think that's crazy to  why I get so why just because he's black, that's silly how annoyed we get over certain 
[01:55:00]  racial stuff.  Like when I see a hate crime not reported because they don't want to say black, I won't  give a black description.  I want to bite somebody's face.  Can you imagine coming from the other side how aggravating it would be?  Like, I don't think it's crazy to be black and say, hey, I would like to see that.  I don't think that's I don't think that's racist.  If the guy was going, my hero is Idi Amin and they were still voting for him, then there's  a major problem.  Just because what?  He's getting a lot of white votes, too.  He's getting a tremendous amount of white votes.  He's a viable candidate.  Guilty, white hating white people. 
[01:55:30]  No.  Guilt.  I have no guilt.  None.  I like me.  I like me.  My customers like me.  My friends like me.  Other white people like me.  Except for that trucker.  Carry the flag, kiddo.  You keep being proud, Dixie.  You keep on being proud.  You keep on telling the lock it is, kiddo.  We really got to take a break.  A lot of stuff is going on in Otto's life.  OttoandGeorge.com to find out what he's up to. 
[01:56:00]  Is that easy today?  Yeah.  OttoandGeorge.com.  We'll continue.  Thank you.  Call Opie and Anthony.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  Call the Opie and Anthony show.  866-WOW-1-WOW.

[01:57:00]  Let's not forget, tomorrow you can get a $10 ticket for our comedy show that we're doing  on Saturday at the PNC Bank Arts Center in Homedale, New Jersey.  Otto from Otto and George will absolutely be performing this Saturday.  And I'm looking forward to that, Otto.  Thank you.  But $10 tickets go on sale tomorrow.  One day only, by the way.  LiveNation.com.  That's right.  Peter Heggs from Cleveland. 
[01:57:30]  Good morning to Cleveland.  Also, we should say good morning to Boston.  We got great ratings from Boston.  Yes, thanks, Boston.  We kind of like casually blew that off.  But doing very, very, very well in Boston.  Beating that dumb man show.  Peter from Cleveland writes, first off, happy birthday to Jimmy.  Thank you.  Go give a hooker a blank blanking.  Anthony, calm down.  We want Obama to be president because he truly represents our interests. 
[01:58:00]  Who's our?  Also, good point, Jimmy.  And then, once again, Anthony, stop being so short-sighted and complaining about taxes.  Why?  You know something?  Go blow.  I can complain about taxes if I want.  Oh, yeah.  Because I'm the one paying them.  An insane amount.  So don't even tell me.  God, I'm sick of you leeches on my back. 
[01:58:30]  You're all leeches sucking off me, off my teat.  We're trying to figure out why there are 200,000 people in Berlin for Obama.  Yeah.  And I guess this band, Reamon?  How do you say this band's name?  R-E-A-M-O-N-A.  R-E-A-M-O-N-N.  Excuse me. 
[01:59:00]  Performed, and they're one of the hottest things going in Germany.  So a lot of people went to see this band.  And then stuck around to see what Obama had to say.  Yeah.  Or at least that's how some people are spinning this now.  It's called a group.  It's called a group.  It's called a group.  Oh, you know, it's got to be just something really angry.  And then another band called the German Reggae Sanjer Patrice.  What does that mean?  Patrice?  What?  Patrice was doing some reggae for the German people for Obama.  Ah, whatever.  And it looked like we got a picture of the band with Obama,  and it looks like he's throwing up a gang sign. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah, Obama's like doing an M kind of a...  But it turns out he's just showing off a ring that the band gave him.  So he's an honorary member of this band,  and supposedly there's only five of these rings,  and now Obama has one of the rings.  I hope he has no clue, and it's like a Hitler Youth ring they gave him.  Wears it with pride.  Hey, you know what that is over there?  Lying suit and tie wearing devil baby.  That's all he is.  Nothing behind those eyes.  Lifeless eyes, like a doll's eyes. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah, like a doll's eyes.  Yeah, well, that's your next president.  Let's say hi to Nick in Ohio.  Nick?  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey, how you guys doing this morning?  Hi, Nick.  Doing all right, Nick.  I was just going to say that even if Obama does get elected then,  I mean, you've got to remember what Carlin said.  It's a big club, and none of us are in it.  So he's going to go with what his party's doing,  and the black people are going to hate that.  So what are they going to do then?  I don't think the black people are going to hate what Democrats are doing. 
[02:00:30]  No.  I mean, either way, the black people, they hate authority,  and Obama's going to be a figure of authority.  Jesus.  A blanket statement?  Black people, they hate authority.  Look at this guy, Nick.  He's probably right, but who likes it?  Yeah.  Nobody likes authority.  It doesn't matter what color you are.  Having authority put on you.  Who actually likes authority out there?  Seriously.  I can think of one dumb head nodding along with this guy.  Right.  Yeah.  Someone had an 18-wheeler.  Yup, yup, see? 
[02:01:00]  See?  Yeah.  All right, Nick.  I think there's going to be a lot of people disappointed  that there isn't drastic change when Obama becomes the president  of the United States of America.  Oh, really?  They lie to get elected.  There'll be some change, but not this drastic change  that people think is going to happen because Obama becomes president.  How many, every four years, another sham artist comes along  and everybody sees hope?  We're trying to get a montage together.  A third of every dollar you make is theirs,  or you go to jail.  What free country? 
[02:01:30]  Exactly.  You're not really free to do much.  We want to get a montage of all the presidential candidates  over the years that have talked about change.  Change.  Oh, change.  We need true change.  Change.  Real change.  Change.  Change.  Change.  Change.  Change.  Do you?  Every single time.  All right, you guys want to change your gears a little bit?  I mean, this Obama thing, we do this on a regular basis.  You know that.  Yeah.  We got a 73-year-old retired Japanese businessman  turning into a porn star.  Yeah. 
[02:02:00]  And we got a man opening fire at a,  open fires at kids' church, performance of Annie.  What do you want to go?  Performance of Annie?  Yeah.  That sounds fun.  Is it that bad?  I don't know.  The sweet and the sour.  All right, let's play that then.  All right.  Let's see what this story is all about.  Police in Knoxville, Tennessee are searching the apartment of that man accused of killing  two people during a church service. 
[02:02:30]  Jim Atkinson is under arrest and charged with murder.  Children were performing a play at the church service yesterday when witnesses say Atkinson  began shouting hateful words.  The event allegedly opened fire, killing 60-year-old Greg McKendry and 61-year-old Linda Crager.  Seven others were hurt, all of them adults.  People at the church finally were able to tackle the gunmen to the ground.  The FBI is looking into what he was shooting.  It can be classified as a hate crime. 
[02:03:00]  Dude.  Well, what do you think?  He hated something.  He yelled out hateful words.  Right.  And then fired.  Yeah.  And it was hateful.  Yeah.  And they now are considering hate crime.  Could you please be a little more specific?  That's not the news.  I want to know.  I want to know what the hate was from.  Did he shoot a six-year-old?  Yeah.  In the church?  Why wouldn't they just beat him to death?  I never understood why when good Samaritans hold people for police for such a heinous crime, 
[02:03:30]  they don't just kill him.  It's easy.  You put a knee on the neck, you just crush the windpipe and go,  he was trying to get away.  He had the gun.  He was doing this.  You're not going to get one person that's not going to back you up with a dead six-year-old.  Poor guy must have fell down.  Poor guy must have fell down.  I think it was a dead 60-year-old.  No, but the second, I could be wrong.  He said he shot a kid, I think.  I think a six-year-old.  That's what I thought I heard.  But anyway, if you open fire at church, why don't they just beat you to death?  Yeah.  Like, save the taxpayer's money.  Just kill him.  Yeah.  Or shoot him. 
[02:04:00]  Take it.  Well, you probably can't because then you have to answer.  So everybody just step on him.  He might have still been holding the gun.  Sometimes they don't drop it.  You bite him.  You know what you do?  Sink your teeth into the bridge of his nose.  Sink your teeth into the side of his face.  He'll drop the gun.  You grab his hand with the gun, and you put it against his head, and you pull the trigger  and go, ah, damn, I hate when they kill themselves.  Then you can't bring him to justice.  I know.  Somebody would ration.  And are you happy or sad?  Three times they shot himself.  It's in the chest.  Oh, yeah.  It's in the leg.  It was a 60 and a 61-year-old.  A 60 and a 61-year-old? 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, so who cares?  Yeah, no great boss.  They pretty much threw the prime of their life anyway.  If it was a kid, then we'd care.  Then we'd all be mad.  If they pay for stuff at the grocery store with change, screw them.  And you want one more or not?  Sure.  We're all very angry today, but you want one more?  Sure.  All right.  Jeff Lyons in Philly writes, I used to think Twitchell's was your worst recurring bit,  but the scared little white guy with big guns spouting the same tired old Obama spiel  is truly the worst.  We get it, Ant. 
[02:05:00]  You made your point again.  Move on.  Go clean a barrel or two.  You know something?  I hope someday your house gets invaded, a home invasion, and you sit there and watch  your wife get raped by Jeff Goldblum and your daughter get ravaged and it just goes on  as you watch before they're killed in front of you.  That's it.  That's all I wish for.  That's that easy. 
[02:05:30]  I like my guns.  Let's go to Scott and Buffalo.  They're handy.  Scott, Scott, Buffalo, Scott in Buffalo.  He's not there.  I was watching a show.  It was A&E on Demand.  It's called I Survived.  Yeah.  It's unbelievable.  They have, it's about people who survived these horrible near-the-death experiences.  Yeah, yeah.  And they have three people, like the one episode was this girl, Lonnie, and- 
[02:06:00]  Five being married to Burt Reynolds.  I got lippy occasionally.  Made fun of his hair.  I slept with Stroke Erase twice.  And there was, uh, there was her, and I forget the other two that were in there.  Oh, one guy named Stanley who was kidnapped at gunpoint here in New York.  He was a U.S. attorney.  And one more.  And they all walk through these near-death experiences.  They've had, like, Lonnie's boyfriend shot her in the head four times.  And she talked about how she had to play dead for hours. 
[02:06:30]  It's really fascinating.  Wow.  Stanley was kidnapped at gunpoint.  They found out he was a U.S. attorney.  And he was held for a few days.  And I forget what the other woman, uh, did.  The other guy survived some kind of a freezing cold thing.  Don't struggle with your abductors, Stanley.  Do what they say and then run.  Perhaps I could hit them with a pie. 
[02:07:00]  See, like two peas in a pod.  Hmm.  He seems to have a gun.  I don't know what to do, Holly.  Play dead.  Why don't you pattern your life after mine?  I go where I want and do what I want and then tell our wives. 
[02:07:30]  We ship hiked, didn't we, Stanley?  We summed our way.  I love those guys.  What happened to Stanley?  He was at gunpoint.  He was the guy that got kidnapped?  Yes.  But they walk you through.  Like, there's three of them.  And they're all...  You don't hear one complete story, then the second complete story.  It's like you'll hear 15% of one, 15% of one, 15% of one.  And then they walk...  Make a hang on.  This way, they all keep you interested.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you're healing people.  Like, one guy is just talking about, in one of the episodes, he's about how his neighbor 
[02:08:00]  cut his throat.  And he's like, and then he sliced my throat one way and back the other way.  Damn.  A guy wanted drug money.  It was really...  Yeah, nice.  Nice people.  One woman was in the garden, and then she went in the house, and her husband wasn't  found, and she started getting beaten by a guy who wound up raping her and kidnapping  her from her home and keeping her for a week.  It's wonderful.  I mean...  And you know they survived because they're there talking, so I'm not going to go that  way.  The girl who got shot four times in the head is now the flute in Jethro Tull. 
[02:08:30]  And she's the spokeswoman for Excedrin.  Let's go to Dante in New York.  For Christmas, she gets lead hats.  Dante, what's up?  Hey.  He has a problem with what Ant just said.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Dante!  What happened, Dante?  See, here you go, Dante.  Don't listen to the radio.  Listen to the phone.  He basically wanted to say that you can't just kill anyone. 
[02:09:00]  Of course not.  But I think he was probably wanting to comment on what we said about the guy in the church.  If a guy in a church opens fire and then the Samaritans pin him down, and you always  hear about this.  Maybe an innocent bystander gets shot and then people pin him down in the playground and  wait for police.  Like, how is the guy alive?  Why not some outrage where you just, like, you know, choke the guy or just crush his wind  pipe and go, it was a lot of people.  He had a gun.  We were trying to subdue him, and things happened. 
[02:09:30]  I always thought that the arresting officer who got marked Chapman when he killed John  Lennon should have just pulled his service revolver and just blown his brains out, you  know, and then just said, I was a Beatle fan.  Arrest him if you want.  Yeah.  Nothing would have happened to him.  The whole city would have been at his back, you know?  Yeah.  Or the guy Richard Reed on the American Airlines flight.  Oh, that guy, yeah.  You catch him trying to blow his feet up and take him down.  Oh, yeah.  Just kill him, man.  He's dead.  You gotta kill him.  Kill him.  And the guy that stands up, you all just saw him shoot these people.  You don't need a scummy lawyer. 
[02:10:00]  That guy's in prison now watching free HBO and watching Entourage and trying to blow up  a jet with his stupid sneaker.  Now everybody has to remove their shoes for the rest of time.  Yeah.  Because it is a jerk-off move.  They should have just strangled him.  Yeah.  They should have just choked him to death.  Yeah.  His head would squash like an eggplant.  Like out of your Seafeld's head?  I guess, I don't think we have time to get into the 73-year-old retired Japanese businessman 
[02:10:30]  turned porn star.  If you want, we could squeeze it in.  What, is he making home movies?  He decided, you know.  73, wow.  Yeah, to change occupations at 73 years old.  73, that's a good one.  Shigeo Takuto looks like your average retiree.  But there is nothing average about this 73-year-old when he steps in front of the camera.  Shigeo Takuto is a porn star.  From the old to the young, Takuto woos and coos and always gets the girl. 
[02:11:00]  With 200 porn movies under his belt, Takuto, that's his porn name, is Japan's leading man  in the genre of elderly porn.  This guy rocks.  Wow.  He's probably the only one.  Huh?  He's the leading man in elderly porn.  He's probably the only one.  Yeah.  He wants to bang old people.  I know.  Let's go to Jason.  We've got to go backwards.  Jason, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Listen, I had heard on the news this morning that that guy that went crazy in the church, 
[02:11:30]  that one of the people that he shot with a shotgun was blocking a child from getting shot.  That guy should be stomped.  He should have been wiped out like an insect.  He should have been bludgeoned to death.  And everyone in the church said he stood up, he fired a weapon, and a bunch of us jumped  on him.  We don't know what happened.  What happened to the angry villagers storming, chasing Frankenstein into the windmill?  Pitchforks and torches.  Yeah, with the short pants and the leder hoses.  Back to the old dude in Japan. 
[02:12:00]  I retired and didn't have anything to do, says Takuta, a former 9-to-5 travel agent.  This is my second life.  I don't know how long I can keep living, but I want to enjoy the rest of it.  To be honest, I don't understand why people are buying these videos, says Ruichi Kadoaki,  president of Ruby Productions, which makes Takuta's movies.  Ruby pioneered the elderly porn field by accident.  It started producing adult movies with middle-aged stars, then older and older actors, and saw  better and better sales.  Ruby now specializes in elderly porn, and is looking into selling his DVDs in retirement 
[02:12:30]  homes.  That's terrible.  I'm going to vomit.  What's the difference between pussy and sushi?  Rice.  Why would old people want to look at old people having sex?  Yeah, I don't think they do.  Why don't you want to look at young people having sex?  Old people porn is great if you're at a party, and you want to goof.  You throw on to all people, banging.  Everybody laughs and has punch.  Well, our Century Sex tape got a lot of views. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah, it's just a good freak show.  Yeah, some lady supposedly was 100 getting banned.  It's not a turn-on, it's an aberration.  It's a curiosity.  Yeah, but people are buying these movies.  Wow.  One more clip.  In his generation, Takuta is a superstar, says Kono.  He encourages older people to think, I can do this because that old man can do this.  My friends say I'm lucky because I have a job where I'm valued, says Takuta.  Takuta, many seniors get depressed because they don't have anything to do.  They go crazy. 
[02:13:30]  Takuta's wife and daughter support his second career, but they don't want to know the details.  Takuta hopes to work until he's 80 or even older, giving it his all, he says, until the end.  I need.  I need.  Fluffer is getting a lot of overtime, right?  Two ice cream sticks and some duct tape.  Make it a splint.  That's great.  We need to see clips of this guy in action, I'm thinking. 
[02:14:00]  All right.  What do we got today?  We got Otto from Otto and George.  Stopped by and did great for us.  Can I plug my St. George Theater?  St. George Theater?  Yeah, yeah.  Please.  And then after the comedy show this Saturday, he's got another gig to pull.  St. George Theater in Staten Island, August 7th.  For tickets, box office 718-442-2900.  And also, OttoandGeorge.com.  And go on YouTube, Otto and George Meet Jesus.  Yes.  And don't forget, tomorrow we got tickets going for $10 for our comedy show this Saturday. 
[02:14:30]  Something that Live Nation's doing with a bunch of their shows.  And we're one of those shows.  So tomorrow only, you can get a ticket for $10.  And I've been giving out a phone number of you can call and leave me messages.  And I actually call people back sometimes.  Not always.  917-267-2602.  I'm going to be updating that more, especially as I go into my surgery in a week and a half.  Okay.  We're out of here.  All righty.  Thank you.  It was fun.  We'll see you guys tomorrow. 
[02:15:00]  We're off to XM.  Serious XM.  Or XM Serious?  I don't know.  Off to XM where all hell is breaking loose.  They're sharpening the machetes.  We're just hoping to survive.  We'll have to wait and see on that.  All right, guys.  Thanks.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's M202. 
[02:15:30]  In the world of Radio Shock, Jack, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[02:16:00]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shop jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shop jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shop jocks, Opie and Anthony.  I go into her room and there are panties on the floor.  Oh, you're getting creepy.  I had to pick up the panties and put them on.  I can't believe he said that.  Opie and Anthony.  Cat shovel baseball.  Oh, nice. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, that was him.  I didn't hit him hard enough.  Opie and Anthony.  Terry Schiavo, I loved you in the grudge.  Will you be doing more voiceover work?  This is the worst show I've done.  This is the worst show I've ever been on.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Oh, God damn it. 
[02:17:00]  Are you kidding me?  What's the matter?  Where's E-Rock?  What canal?  We had like a five-minute discussion.  Are we going to play the John Mayer?  Are we playing the John Mayer thing?  Oh, my God, E-Rock.  No, I said before.  Whatever.  Who gives a shit?  Oh, I'll be fired soon anyway.  It's the Opie and Anthony show here at XM Satellite Radio.  I guess John Mayer did like a quick little like ID.  Yeah.  And there was a whole discussion pretty much the entire walkover today. 
[02:17:30]  And then it continued in studio.  And in the end, E-Rock misunderstood me.  Dropped the ball again.  I said, yes.  Play it right after the intro before Rage.  Just the ball, E-Rock.  Boom, boom, boom.  It was a quick dumb thing.  So it doesn't matter.  But whatever.  Rick at St. Louis.  Of course, call.  He says, I was a victim of a home invasion last night.  Want me to call in?  Yes.  Yes.  Of course.  Yes.  You want to start with cockroaches? 
[02:18:00]  Cockroaches.  Yes.  Well, before we go on there, how was the secret Back to the Future show?  What a lot of fun that was.  It wasn't a secret show though, right?  No, it wasn't secret.  It was the, what was it officially called?  Uh, well.  Danny, the, um.  It was the secret show to the future.  The secret show to the future.  And basically, it was all you guys playing Back to the Future.  You told everyone to push play at the same time?  Yep.  And then you let the movie roll, and you guys commented about Back to the Future. 
[02:18:30]  And we commented, and we noticed after a while, most of the comments was about Marty  fucking his mother.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, well, when you really break that movie down to its bare essentials, it's really  just, Marty's mother just completely frothing over him.  Is a whore.  Yeah.  Pretty much like anybody that shows her any attention, uh, she'll just open her fucking  legs for.  Yeah.  Pretty much it.  Like, she was so heavy into Marty, and like, all it really took was George to like, you 
[02:19:00]  know, save her from the, like, it was one instance.  From Biff the Rapist.  All of a sudden, she wasn't even interested in any of that Marty cock anymore, and just  Yeah.  immediately cock-hopped over to George.  And then even after that, when they're at the dance.  Cunt.  Fucking redhead douchebag comes over, and cuts in, and starts dancing with her, and  you know, George is walking away, and what does she do?  She's not pushing the fucking redhead douche away, and saying, hey, George, come here,  you know, I'm with you.  No, and then George has to come up and mush him in the face, and then they kiss, of course, 
[02:19:30]  and everything's fine.  And Dan, did the show get, uh, good reviews?  I have no idea.  I was asleep during the last 15 minutes.  For a show that went from midnight on a Sunday morning to three in the morning, you got like  a 48-page listening thread with like 17,000 views.  Like, I was, I was actually really surprised by that.  It was pretty weird.  Yeah.  You fell asleep, Ant?  No, no.  Actually, we were done with the movie, and then I went back out and left.  I, I didn't, I wasn't in the last 10 minutes of the, uh, program.  Yeah.  We came back just to kind of wrap it up and end the show, and, uh... 
[02:20:00]  You, you didn't even finish the show?  No, I did.  And then it was, uh, it was over.  The movie was over.  We were done with the Back to the Future show.  Yeah.  And then what happened?  I just figured I'd, you know, let these guys, leave these guys to their own devices.  And did Jimmy, did I miss something?  Anthony fell asleep?  No, no, no.  I was missed.  No, no, that was, uh, I was done with the show.  Like, I was done, so I was just outside.  Uh...  I heard a rumor, too.  How, who told you he fell asleep?  No one.  He just said that he was not there for the last 20 minutes, so I was asking.  No, it wasn't 20 minutes.  It was like 10 minutes.  Oh, no, I didn't hear that.  There was a rumor that you slept here. 
[02:20:30]  Or fell asleep or something.  No, no.  Oh, there's some chatter going on, man.  Chatter?  Some people are chattering.  I was, uh, oh, I was in one of the chairs over there.  Just mellowing out?  Uh, yeah, and I kind of shut my eyes.  Was there a lot of, uh, beer being drank?  We had a couple beers.  We don't have bosses, you can say it.  That stuff doesn't allow for the use of beverages.  You know, I had a couple of beers.  Dude, the person that would fire you for that is getting fired themselves, so you can openly  talk about drinking or not drinking at this point.  We do have bosses now. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, yes.  New bosses, bro.  It's just going to be a different guy to fire, isn't it?  The new boss.  That's not a good way to start out.  Secret show is great.  Secret show is great.  So the reviews are coming in.  Yeah, we did have a good time.  I'm so lame because...  Big discussion.  I wanted to stay up and, uh, listen to the show.  Uh-huh.  And I do have the Back to the Future DVD, and I was ready to go.  Oh, see?  And I fell asleep.  I couldn't stay awake until midnight on a Saturday.  Damn.  Damn.  How lame is that? 
[02:21:30]  It would have been cool.  You could have been part of it.  It was one of those...  On the other end.  It was one of those things where you're trying to stay awake, trying to stay awake, and you  just don't stay awake.  I was trying everything, too.  I was just so effing tired for whatever reason.  I don't know.  A lot of trivia...  Yeah.  ...was being passed along.  We were trying to, you know, outdo each other on the little trivia notes and stuff,  and Sam just could not get over the amount of foreshadowing that was...  Which, yeah, if you just kind of breeze through the listening thread, all the listeners, they  weren't happy about all the foreshadowing.  Foreshadowing.  Because all Sam would say during any scene was like, well, I believe what that is is 
[02:22:00]  a foreshadowing of what happens later.  And he wouldn't stop fucking saying foreshadowing.  Nice.  Like, shut up.  Enough about the foreshadowing.  All right.  We got...  His name's not Rick.  It's Rock.  Rock in St. Louis?  Rock Quarry.  Rock?  Hello?  Hey there, Rock.  Can you hear us?  Hey, it's Rick in St. Louis.  Yeah, whatever.  That's what I said the first time, but then they put Rock up on the phone thing, so...  All right, Rick.  What do you got?  Hey, man.  12.30 this morning.  I'm sitting there. 
[02:22:30]  I'm sleeping in my chair.  I hear my storm door open, thinking it's my son coming home.  The door...  They jiggle the door.  Somehow they got the door open.  One guy walks through my freaking house.  I went, what the fuck was this?  I jump up immediately, grab the guy around the neck, tackle him to the fucking ground.  My wife is in hysterics.  She's wondering what's going on.  At this point, I tell her, I said, look, go to the closet, grab my fucking 12-gauge. 
[02:23:00]  I got him subdued, duct taped him up, called the house, or called the cops, not called my  house.  Jesus Christ, I'm still so fucking amped up.  It's unreal.  Held the 12-gauge to his head until the cops got there.  The guy said he was drunk and went to the wrong house.  Now, this gentleman, let's just say, he has no business being in my neighborhood.  And the cops whisked him away and charged him with attempted burglary and a home invasion. 
[02:23:30]  That's great.  Did he have a weapon?  Yes, I do.  No, no, no.  Did he have a gun or a knife?  He had a knife, which, you know, when I tackled him, he lost the knife.  There was another guy with him.  The other guy took off running away.  I heard this morning, before I went to work, the cops have found him, found the other guy.  They've both been charged.  Good for you, man.  It's great.  Well, here's the problem, though.  They're going to get out of jail, and they're now going to be very mad at you. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah.  And they're coming back to get you.  No, they're not.  I would move.  No one's mad at you when they break into your house, and you fuck them up.  They're like, all right, he got us.  Ah, got me.  You can't.  No one can get mad at that.  What part of St. Louis?  Because a lot of people want to know if it's their neighborhood.  Eight miles east of downtown St. Louis in Belleville, Illinois.  Is that a good place?  I don't know, but do you remember this song, Why Don't You Meet Me in St. Louis, Louis?  I love that one.  I love that one. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah, but, I mean, I'm still so freaking amped up.  This is unreal, you know?  I mean, just the thought that somebody could invade my, you know, my home or my wife and  child.  That's right.  That's good.  You had a shotgun, man.  Guns.  Excellent.  Guns from my cold, dead hands.  And I'm telling you what, after this tonight, I'm going out and buying a Bushmaster 223.  There you go.  But you got the shotgun already.  And that thing right there.  He's got the shotgun, though.  I need more guns.  A little more precision. 
[02:25:00]  He needs more guns.  Who doesn't?  More guns for everybody.  More guns, more gooder.  You don't need precision.  Just fucking spray.  Unload.  Yeah.  Let her rock.  Well, I'm glad you're all right there, Rick.  Thanks, boys.  I'm punching out, man.  Thank you.  All right.  Take care, man.  That's just creepy.  Yeah.  You got to watch that.  People are constantly going to be trying to get into your house and get your stuff.  Get your woman.  It's like cavemen.  They're like cavemen out there.  Got to be armed with a nice club. 
[02:25:30]  Bash them over the head.  All right.  Let's get the cockroach count.  This is all I thought about this weekend.  La cucarachas.  We learned last week that there are cockroaches that have completely invaded and taken over  this facility.  It's infested.  It's infested.  So we laid down some traps on Friday, Saturday, somewhere, Friday.  And now we get to see what our traps caught.  Sam has one of the traps in his hands.  Well, the other trap that was under a file cabinet just got one. 
[02:26:00]  Oh, God.  That one's...  This one was under the sink and has...  The real problem is that there's like at least...  I count six to seven baby cockroaches.  Okay.  Which means they're reproducing.  Oh, wow.  Cockroaches reproducing in an environment of filth and fucking food and disgust?  They're also all still alive because they're moving their antennae, but they can't move  because their feet are stuck.  They're trying to figure out.  They're trying to communicate. 
[02:26:30]  Hey, my feet are stuck.  So are mine, idiots.  Talking to each other.  How are your feet?  Stuck.  I'm walking, but I'm not getting any closer.  What's happening?  It's glue, idiot.  We're in a glue trap.  We discussed this.  We're so dead.  I'm walking.  You're not getting any closer.  Could you explain that?  Ted the Cockroach.  Ted the imperceptive cockroach.  I'm hungry, but there's no food to be found, and I can't seem to get anywhere.  So there's a total of 16 baby cockroaches in this.  And full size is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, nine. 
[02:27:00]  Nine full size cockroaches.  Let me see that.  So there's 25 in this one trap alone?  Yeah.  Oh.  Where are the real big guys, though?  The big fatties, like the one that Poe stepped on the other day?  Oh, my God.  They're there.  One.  Yeah, he's right.  Look at how many cockroaches.  Look at the other side.  I can't stand the cockroach.  There's way more than 16.  There's a lot of really tiny ones in here.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, 
[02:27:30]  fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen.  You said nineteen on the one side?  And then one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen.  You missed fourteen.  You missed that guy?  Dude, there's thirty-something in this trap alone.  You miscounted.  Well, I got one in this trap, so that's correct.  And one in that?  Yes.  So there you go.  It's funny.  There's all those roaches and a dog.  Or a turtle.  Dog. 
[02:28:00]  Just some weird animal.  Hopefully, uh...  There's an armadillo in here.  Let's fuck it.  Hopefully, Travis's bulldog will get caught in one of these dumb things.  Oh, that useless animal?  Yeah, absolutely.  Or Travis's beard.  And by that, I don't mean Lisa.  Here.  He's gay.  Here you go.  Oh, come on.  Ant, ant, ant, ant.  No, it's all right, Ant.  It's okay.  Because a road strap bounced right by you.  Yes, I know.  One of them might have fallen out.  Yeah.  Get that fucking... 
[02:28:30]  Look, they're all moving around.  Do you think they're saying to each other,  Hey, uh, we just got thrown,  and yet we didn't fall out.  What do you think happened?  It's new safety standards.  Unfortunately, they have new safety standards.  That's why...  See, the glow's a good thing.  They don't want us to fall.  We're buckled up.  Yeah.  So now what?  Are we laying down some new traps?  Yeah, put another new trap under the sink  because that's where the cornucopia of roaches came from.  Yeah, sure.  Uh, I put one in Poe's office  because I can only assume how many roaches  will be found in there.  Yeah. 
[02:29:00]  All right.  So, yeah.  So not bad for our first, uh, our first hunt.  Ah.  We got about 30 to 35 cockroaches in the two traps.  Well, the one trap wasn't impressive at all, but...  No.  Well, you know, it adds one.  Right.  All right.  Let's say hi to Dave in Massachusetts.  Dave.  I can explain the cockroaches in one word.  Yeah.  Earl.  You think?  Thanks.  Uh, Blind...  That was Blind Dave.  Wow, that was?  Absolutely that was Blind Dave.  You're good with the voices and stuff. 
[02:29:30]  Do you know that not only was Earl here, uh,  at about 9.30 on Saturday night,  just hanging around, doing who knows what,  but he actually came back.  Like, I remember seeing Earl, like,  it was after midnight by that point.  Yeah, it was 12.30 when he came back.  Why?  Why is Earl here at all hours of the day and night on weekends?  That's what he does.  He forgot something.  Public file.  Had to stay for 45 minutes to get it, I guess.  You guys are so stupid.  The reason Earl is here,  because this place is way better than his apartment. 
[02:30:00]  With the...  Even with the roaches.  That's all that's about.  Mm-hmm.  People have been trying to figure out the Earl thing for years.  It's so obvious.  He doesn't have big, huge, flat-screen TVs  and nice couches to lounge on and all that.  You make a good point.  And, uh, cable, you know,  cable systems that get every single channel imaginable.  That's why he's here.  There's no mystery.  This place is better than where he lives.  Let's go to David in North Carolina.  David.  Hey.  Hey.  Yeah.  You're talking to these cockroaches.  You ever watch a show called Verminators? 
[02:30:30]  You can find out a lot.  A single female can produce up to 20,000 babies a month.  It doesn't matter how intelligent anything coming out of their mouth is.  It doesn't matter.  He just gave out a little stat.  It's nice.  Probably accurate, scientifically speaking.  But, uh...  Just sounds like balderdash.  Balderdash.  Thank you, Jim.  That is exactly what it sounds like.  What happens...  Poppycock. 
[02:31:00]  Could someone explain the southern accent?  Like, what happens in the mouth that causes that?  That might kind of talk like that.  What is it...  I think it might be the French influence.  I don't know.  What the fuck is it?  There is something...  Like, any accent in this country can be traced back to people that came over.  If you look at an English accent and a Boston accent, they're very similar.  The dropping of the R's is very English. 
[02:31:30]  But it's like an English accent without that little lilt.  That English lilt to it.  So it just sounds silly.  It just shows you that humans are influenced way too easily.  Yeah.  And then it lasts forever.  Same thing with New York.  A New York accent is part of an English accent.  Right.  But then the south.  That is an odd kind of a thing.  What the fuck influenced that?  I don't know.  But Sam's got a post-it that he feels very confident about.  Oh.  Yes.  Feel confident.  Danny has named this new segment. 
[02:32:00]  It's called What's the Traps?  What's the Traps?  What's the Traps?  I like What's the Traps.  What's the Traps, yo?  First day doing What's the Traps?  30 to 35 cockroaches.  Let's go to Chris in Houston.  Chris.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, use the Asti Martini Rosi Champagne.  It's real sweet.  I left a glass of it out one night and came back the next morning.  There was like five or six of them drunk and drowned. 
[02:32:30]  Come on.  I'm dead.  I'm dead.  All right.  Let's try that.  We want to try all sorts of methods because so far the glue traps are doing very well for us.  I did it the next day, and I got about ten more just drunk and drowned.  But the real issue is why do you live in such a dump?  Because I'm a bastard.  All right.  Good.  We had that exchange.  All right.  Thank you.  Perfect.  But stay bastard next time.  Let's go to North Carolina again.  Sean. 
[02:33:00]  Yep.  You guys shouldn't be killing the cockroaches in studio because the eggs don't crush,  and then they sit on whatever you kill them with, whether it be like sole of a shoe or something.  And then you transport those eggs into your home or whatever you decide to go from there.  Get off.  Don't get me off.  And then so you step on one, and then you walk like three city blocks in the heat,  and then still the eggs are still good.  So you don't understand.  I don't actually step gingerly.  I moonwalk when I go home.  Yeah.  I moonwalk and dance. 
[02:33:30]  Over roaches.  Well, Jimmy, you might be okay if you moonwalk home.  Yeah, I do because it scrapes them.  All right.  We're learning a lot about cockroaches.  That's wonderful.  But I would love to learn a lot about mergers.  Yes.  Well, what's going on in D.C. right now is pretty much what we got in that trap.  They're all just kind of walking in place.  Hey, what happened?  The machetes, like I said, are getting sharpened.  It's going to be a blunt.  Hey, for the people that remain, going to be plenty of good parking spots in that lot. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah.  Don't you worry.  Everyone gets a close spot.  Look on the bright side.  Now, we got Don Wicklund.  He's still in the house, right?  I hope so.  I think Elo's got to be in Chicago by now.  So maybe we could get Wicklund on the phone and get the vibe of what's going on down there  in Washington.  That's what we need to do, right?  We can't get Wicklund on the phone when things are going well, much less when everybody's  just being skewered.  A lot of people saying, don't step on the cockroaches.  You'll bring the eggs back to your house.  I don't step.  That was Poe.  Poe was the one that jumped on that.  Yeah.  How great would it be? 
[02:34:30]  All of a sudden, he came home and there was fucking 50 roaches sitting on his front door.  Gentlemen.  50 less than usual?  Yeah.  I have a feeling that Poe has a lot of roaches at his house.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I hope not.  Being, um...  We should ask him.  You're profiling.  No.  They're creepy.  They're still moving in the trap.  Yeah.  They're icky.  Icky?  I thought you just cut it out.  And you're going to eat?  Yes.  Well, I'm not fucking...  That's what does it.  What's the matter there, Poe?  I'm not going to sit...  Poe's insulted.  Why?  Why is Poe insulted? 
[02:35:00]  You have no roaches, right?  You have cockroaches at your house?  I guarantee it.  No, I don't have any roaches, but I had mice.  I don't have mice anymore.  What happened?  You have mice still.  No, I got rid of the mice.  How did you get rid of the mice?  I got rid of them because I...  It's with a spinning back kick.  Tell me how you got rid of the mice and...  What happened is they were coming in through the dishwasher and I covered up the holes.  Oh.  Wow.  So you don't think you have mice anymore?  Well, they're not coming in anymore.  I don't see any more droppings.  How do you know?  They're there. 
[02:35:30]  If they are, I haven't seen them.  Jimmy turned me on to the whole mice thing.  I go, Jimmy, I found a mouse in my apartment and Jimmy freaked out.  He goes, if you have one, that means you have hundreds.  I'm like, shut up, Jimmy.  No fucking way.  I got just one dumb stray mouse.  And I killed that motherfucker in a glue trap and then proceeded to kill between 50 and  60 more with electric traps.  Infestation.  Yes.  Jimmy was correct.  Oh, they're all around you.  They're just trying to figure out how to get back into your apartment because they know  that's where the good eats are. 
[02:36:00]  Good eats.  Yeah.  Right.  The num-nums.  Huh?  How'd you get rid of the mice?  I made a deal with them.  We played tic-tac-toe.  I won three out of four games.  They had to leave.  That's right.  You temporarily got rid of the mice, my friend.  So they're still there, right?  Yeah.  I would guarantee it.  You know what?  Any of those electric traps around?  I'm not sure.  Set one of those electric traps.  I guarantee...  I will bet you $100, but then I don't know if you're going to be bullshitting me that you  find one by tomorrow morning. 
[02:36:30]  If I set the trap...  One electric trap.  I'll bring it in.  Put some peanut butter in there.  Okay.  All right?  You got it.  I'm telling you they're still around.  Let's say hi to Dave in New York.  Dave.  Yeah.  Hey, Dave.  How you doing, guys?  Good.  Good evening.  Hey, you...  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thanks, Dave.  Hey, Dave.  Do you work in New York City?  Yeah, I work in New York City.  I'm a pest control operator.  I'm licensed in New York and New Jersey.  And I just wanted to let you know, you can rest easy, Opie.  You know, those egg casings can be dropped in a bucket of acid, and nothing will get inside 
[02:37:00]  them.  But if you crush them with your shoe, there's nothing that's going to hatch from them.  All right.  What if one gets in the...  You know, the...  Yeah, the tread.  The tread of your sneaker or something.  No, they can't.  You know, they got to move around.  They can be killed very easily when they're very small.  Sir, the way I kill roaches is I sit on them bare bottom.  What if some of the eggs get caught in my ass hair?  Oh, jeez.  I don't have an answer for that. 
[02:37:30]  I wish I did.  But I just wanted to let you know.  Dave, screw the roaches.  I want to know about rats.  You do pest control in New York City?  Yes, I do.  All right.  What's your feeling on rats?  How many rats are in New York City?  Millions.  Millions.  Millions.  Rats, Michael.  Millions.  Millions.  You know, I go out and I fight the good fight every day, but there's more and more.  I read a...  I finally...  Oh, I never told anyone.  Finally got to the end of that rat book that I've been, you know, picking up every once  in a while and just fascinated with rats. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah, they're everywhere.  Why don't we see more rats then?  Everyone says there's millions and millions in New York City, but you rarely see one.  Usually they're nocturnal.  You won't see them until the infestation is so big that they're running around in the  street during the day.  Right.  So, you know, they burrow underneath and every once in a while, like if you're driving up  West Street and you know how they have those little, you know, those concrete things  with the trees coming out of them on the promenade?  Yeah.  Every once in a while, you'll see one of them popping out or popping out of the sewer.  From there, they're just going to grab something and they're running right back into the hole. 
[02:38:30]  So they're nocturnal.  You know where I see a good amount of rats?  Not now that they're not doing construction, but Washington Square Park, when you walk  by at like three in the morning at the park, you just see like the leaves scuffling constantly.  They're moving around.  It is infested.  All parks are infested with rats.  Yeah, especially in the subway systems also.  I mean, there's not any time of the day you can go down in the subway and see multiple  rats.  I know that when I'm walking to the studio in the morning, any garbage day, just pick  any garbage day that there's a bag on the street of New York. 
[02:39:00]  If you kick it, rats will come running out of them.  And it's happened to be a bunch of times.  Oh, my God.  Just plenty of rats.  And if they actually come towards you and they turn around real quick, they can get you  with their tail.  Yeah.  And that hurts like a son of a bitch.  How bad have you seen like roach infested apartments or rat infested apartments?  I've actually lifted up drop ceilings in office buildings and apartments where it actually  pours down on me.  It looks like a shower head full of cockroaches are coming down on me. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, they just start pouring out of the ceiling?  Yeah, it's disgusting.  I actually, when we're going in to do a clean out, I have to wear something similar to like  a tight turtleneck kind of thing and zip up my cover all the way to the top.  How about a glue hat in case they fall on your head?  Glue hat.  A hat made of glue.  I wear earplugs.  It's gross.  My neighbors think I'm insane.  I've got to strip down before my wife lets me into the apartment.  I'm standing out there in my boxes before I can.  I've got to bag everything up before I can come into my apartment. 
[02:40:00]  And the thing about rats, you'll never get rid of them.  They get smarter with all the stuff you guys are coming out with to kill them, right?  They learn?  It's true.  Well, rats are smarter than actually mice because what a rat will do is send a probe rat  out.  If there's something new in the environment, when we bait, they'll send them.  A probe rat out just to check it out, see what's going on.  And if they come back and everything is all right, then I'll bring a few more of his buddies.  It's actually kind of spooky.  A probe rat?  Is that why, like, they've done studies on rats.  They've actually heard when you listen real close, one going, but it's not my turn. 
[02:40:30]  All right, you've got point.  I don't want to go.  I have a bad feeling about this one.  What's going to end up happening with the rats, let's say, in New York City?  Is it going to get to a point where, or do they control themselves because there's not  enough food?  Like, how does that work?  Or why aren't they continuing to multiply to the point where we have to just give up  and leave New York City?  Well, actually, if there's not enough food, they will turn to cannibalism. 
[02:41:00]  Right.  You know, so it's just kind of a delicate balance between baiting enough and then taking enough  food and harborage away.  You know, this is where, like, the Parks Department comes in.  Like, if they keep all the stuff trimmed properly, then there's no harborage for them.  You know, we need to be doing a regular baiting thing on a regular basis for some of these  areas where, you know, a lot of these, they wouldn't allow baiting before, that kind of  thing.  What do you mean by baiting?  Like, like, like, say, telling one rat that the other one said something about him? 
[02:41:30]  Wait, why wouldn't they allow baiting?  Well, because you go, you get a lot of these typical conservationists in New York City that  won't allow, you know, they feel that a rat is, is, you know, an animal and, you know,  animals have all your life and that kind of thing.  So the conservationists in New York State, especially in New York City, have kind of  tied our hands and kept us from doing the proper thing.  We're fucking doomed.  Yeah, that's pretty much what's throwing us in.  Are you kidding me?  Ridiculous environmentalists. 
[02:42:00]  That's it.  That's it.  I mean, I'm kind of glad you're here.  I have a job.  That's how I pay the bills.  I, um, recently I was walking home, um, after a late night, uh, drinking with some, uh,  some of the Philly crew and stuff, and we were walking by a brownstone and there was  some garbage and I saw a rat go running into like the front area of a brownstone where  there's some garbage, right?  I go, wow, that's cool.  And I went in for a closer look and I swear to God, and maybe you could tell me what this  means, that the rat hissed at me.  I didn't see it anymore. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, no shitty hiss at you.  It started hissing.  What, what does that mean?  Was there babies in the area?  It was a cat.  No, no.  Usually what happens is when you get too close and a rat is trapped, it'll get up on his hind  legs and kind of do this hissing, kind of guttural sound kind of to scare something away.  Or it chews your face off.  Dude, let me tell you, I was fucking petrified because it was dark and all I heard was this  hissing coming from the darkness.  I couldn't run fast enough.  Yeah, it's disgusting. 
[02:43:00]  And the problem with rats is on a hardness index, their teeth are actually harder than  steel.  Is there a way when the rat's like standing up like that and hissing?  Did you hear that?  You can't just blow by that.  Their teeth are harder than steel.  Oh, okay.  On a hardness index, yeah, they can actually...  Why don't they make buildings out of rat teeth?  Smarty.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  I'm sorry.  But that's an amazing fact about rats.  They can gnaw through anything is basically what this guy's saying.  Yeah, they can actually gnaw through sewer jars.  Anything, you know, below ground, any conduit that carries pipe, that carries electrical 
[02:43:30]  wiring, anything like that.  So they're really, really a nasty, nasty, nasty problem.  And they also know how to unlock their own jaws so they can get through tiny areas and  stuff.  They unhinge their own jaws.  Yeah, they don't have bones.  They have cartilage.  Yeah, they can flatten their skeletons out.  If they can get their head into something, they can get their whole body.  You can actually take a rat and fold him backwards to where his head is touching his paint kind 
[02:44:00]  of thing.  Right.  He won't break his bones.  I heard that's the equivalent of tickling a rat.  He loves it.  If you fold him backwards, you can actually hear them go, teehee.  Look, I'm sniffing my own asshole.  Yeah, they kind of laugh about it, like, oh, you got me.  You got me.  Rats are good-natured about the ribbing.  Yeah.  The one thing about this book that I read, they said at any given time, I think I mentioned  this on the air, but at any given time when you're walking around New York City, you're  within feet of a rat. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  They said there's all sorts of tunnels under every sidewalk.  They're in the walls of almost every building.  They're just everywhere.  Very true.  Let me ask you.  Very true.  It's like a whole network moving right under your feet while you're walking on the sidewalk.  What about this way of getting rid of them?  I've heard this might work.  Whereas, like, what you do is you get into their, like, nests, and you take out their little  positive affirmations that they hang, and you write negative things, and it's oppressive.  You can do that cinnamon undercover like a little rat 21 Jump Street or something. 
[02:45:00]  I don't know.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Good knowledge.  Thanks, guys.  A little knowledge today for everybody.  Let's go to Louisiana.  Carly.  Carly, what's up?  I'm going to wipe that out.  Hey, guys.  I have to tell you what happened to me.  I've never heard this happening to anybody else.  I'm building a house in the country, and before it's finished, we move in.  One night, well, and needless to say, the mice just infested the house. 
[02:45:30]  Wait, is there a country field behind it?  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Are those probably the mice from the field?  Field mice?  Okay, no doubt.  Oh, okay.  The house just infested.  One night, I'm in bed.  Miss, I don't mean to interrupt you, but you said you hadn't finished the house.  Was the roof on yet?  The roof was on.  Okay.  It didn't rain on your bed, did it?  An area that was obviously open.  Okay.  So my boyfriend and I are asleep in bed one night.  Was it spackled?  Yes.  And why aren't you married if you're going to live with somebody? 
[02:46:00]  Do you not want the Lord to accept you in?  Let's get to the real me of the air.  Living in sin.  Yes, he sent mice and pestilence to your sinful home.  It was a plague.  Were there locusts in your bedroom?  You whore.  Flaming hail coming down on your roof.  I'm kidding, miss.  Go ahead.  Apologize.  Okay, so we are awakened by the roof.  How much of the insulation was in place at the time?  That's right, ma'am.  What percentage?  Was there a fire in your home?  Because you said it's never happened.  You've never heard of it happening to anybody. 
[02:46:30]  So what has never happened?  Because I haven't finished the store.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Well, we need to know about your unfinished house first.  It's just an area that was unfinished.  There's no floors or toilets.  They just put a wooden structure around dirt on a field and they live in it.  All right, Carly, go ahead.  Go ahead, madam.  I apologize.  It's okay.  So we are awakened by the worst noise you've ever heard.  We throw the door open.  We don't know what is going on.  Wait, the worst noise I've ever heard.  Oh, really?  Wow.  My mind is going a thousand miles an hour.  No kidding.  Coming up with nothing.  Yeah. 
[02:47:00]  Okay, so the worst noise you've ever heard.  So your door opened.  I'm here and I've got an idea.  We can start there, Jimmy.  And continue.  E-Rock, have you seen my toothbrush?  Or, um, hi, I'm rich.  I'll be teaching your children.  See, that was a Rich Foster.  Yes.  All right, Carly.  Worst noise you've ever heard.  We throw the door open and there is a scene from Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds going on in 
[02:47:30]  the house.  The birds have circulated in the mo that this is Mouse House.  And there are like 2,000 birds killing the mice all in the house.  Wait, 2,000 birds?  Okay, maybe 200.  I smell a lot of birds.  The house is black with birds.  The house is black.  How did the birds get in?  What does your house look like?  Well, it's a little house on a stick and it just has a hole in the front.  And that's where we live.  And the floor has all kinds of little seeds on it. 
[02:48:00]  Seed floor.  Yes.  It's a gingerbread house and the birds like it.  And I can't even, like, talk to my boyfriend because it's too loud.  We're having to scream at each other.  Were your floors made of newspaper?  Maybe they misunderstood.  Yes.  My house is made of cage wiring.  What's that?  It was that.  It was crazy.  And the birds flew in and they killed all the mice.  And it went on for, like, 45 minutes.  And then they all left.  And we never had mice again.  And we finished the house. 
[02:48:30]  Sounds like a scene out of Heaven Almighty.  That's an amazing scene.  It was horrible.  All right, Carly.  Okay.  Thank God you're all right.  Yeah, let's go to Dwayne in Minnesota.  Dwayne?  What's going on, fellas?  Hey.  What's up, Dwayne?  Not much.  I was just going to tell you to shut up and let her finish your story.  But after that ending, you know.  Well, you see, we were kind of just.  Dwayne, here's the brilliance of us.  Because I see what you're saying up there.  Do you have to ruin every story?  We knew that story was going nowhere fast. 
[02:49:00]  So we were trying to get some humor out of it.  No, I didn't know where it was going, Dwayne.  The bottom line is I knew she was going to get to the end.  We were having fun with her along the way.  What you don't understand, like, if we just would have let her say it, then you have to go back and recapture moments that you wanted to goof on.  And it doesn't work.  So a lot of times.  I got you, Jimmy.  Okay, that was me.  Look at that.  He's cutting you off now.  All right.  He understands.  All right, Dwayne.  Thank you.  Let's take a couple more here.  Keith in Jersey.  Keith.  Yo.  How you doing?  Oh, hey.  Hey. 
[02:49:30]  Hey.  I got a little story for Opie and his little garbage experiences.  Yeah.  I used to live in Manhattan.  And after a nice long night of drinking, our stupid little game was to kick the garbage  piles on garbage night and watch all the rats scatter.  And we would all run after the rats and try stomping on them.  And we used to catch a couple of them and make a nice little splatter. 
[02:50:00]  That's like serial killer shit, though.  Yeah.  You know, there's a way to get rid of rats without just stomping on them with your boot.  By the way, that's a cool beginning to a story.  That's not a cool story.  That's a cool beginning.  That should be part one.  I think if you lined up a hundred guys, I think there's maybe one that would actually  run after a rat and try to stomp it to death.  Stomp it.  The rest of them, even though we'd all act like we're brave, most of us would be like,  fuck that. 
[02:50:30]  Do you know the best way to catch rats, and I found this, is you dip your dick in cheese.  Ah.  And then when the rats grab onto it, you flick their little heads.  That sends out a message.  All right.  Let's go to Tony and Jerry.  Tony.  Hey, Jimmy, you're on fire today.  You're fucking killing me.  Oh, thank you.  I had a huge bong hit.  It was probably a $6 toque, I swear to God.  And you said my house is on a stick with a hole in the front.  I lost the whole fucking thing.  I talked for two minutes.  You owe me, kid.  All right, I'm sorry.  I just wanted to let you know.  Right on, man.  Let's go to Kansas City. 
[02:51:00]  I didn't mean that, though, because that was a birdhouse.  Hey, guys, this is Kansas City Dave.  Kansas City Dave, what's up?  How you guys doing?  All right.  I used to go to Oklahoma and stay with my ex-wife still, because we still, I still  fucked her for a little while there, but we got divorced.  And the last time I stayed at her house, I woke up and I felt something crawling,  and I flipped the covers up, and there was a fucking roach crawling out of my ass crack  that was obviously under her covers when I was in the bed.  By the way, do you know right now that roach is somewhere saying, and I thought it was 
[02:51:30]  a good place to hide, all of a sudden, warm, disgusting air passed over me.  I was in a guy's asshole.  And all his friends are laughing at him, like, what'd you do?  The guy just got the hell out of there.  Grossest thing ever.  Yeah, for both of you.  All right, thank you.  Let's go to Frank at Freehold.  Freehold.  Freehold.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  What's up?  Hey, nothing much.  I wanted to tell you guys, I used to work for Con Edison, man.  Did you?  And a lot of the way that the roaches get into the buildings is through the duck work.  If we used to do a service job, if we didn't do a complete service job all the way, you 
[02:52:00]  have to pack all the duck work.  And if you don't do that, the roaches are definitely getting in the building that way.  I want to find where the roaches are hanging out in this freaking facility.  The big guys.  Where we take down something and all of a sudden they...  They just scurry all over the place.  That's what I'm looking for with this whole thing.  Let's go to Tom in Texas.  Tom.  Hey, guys.  The problem with baiting rats is that they die in your walls and it smells bad. 
[02:52:30]  And also it can kill your dog or cat if the rat's dead.  So I was going to say the whole conservation thing, it's more of just, you know, circle  of life crap, you know, where a dog will eat a rat that's been, that has the stuff in  it and also it dies in your walls and you have to tear down walls to get the little fella  out of your hair.  The circle of death.  But it stinks.  It stinks. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah, it seems like it would smell a dead rat in your wall.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Enough about the rats.  All right.  We'll take a quick break.  Someone has to tinkle.  So do I.  Are we getting Wicklin on the phone?  I doubt he'll be able to come on today.  He's probably hiding under his desk right now.  The shield in front of him.  The number you have dialed has been disconnected.  Don Wicklin is no longer here.  So that's going to be down there no matter who you call. 
[02:53:30]  Well, it's going to be you call up XM and only extension one, two and three works.  That's it.  Mark my word.  Bloodbath.  Everyone else gone.  That's going to be the headline someday this week.  I'm going to guess for I'm going to go Wednesday.  Do you think it'll be bloodbath?  Or is there a clever way to say bloodbath in satellite terms, in XM terms?  Eximcution.  Like something like that. 
[02:54:00]  Eximcution.  How about ex-employee?  Ex-employee.  That's good.  That's a good one, too.  Yeah.  It's going to be a sad day.  It's going to be a lot of talented people out of work.  Satellite-ening the load at XM.  I'm not saying these are good.  I'm just saying what they might do in the paper.  Oh, okay.  Seriously bad.  Yeah, that's an awful little wordplay.  Yeah. 
[02:54:30]  It's going to be ugly over there, man.  Wow.  People seriously are going to lose their jobs, too.  Some people at XM haven't qualified.  Dude, they have to run XM.  XM still has to run for people that don't want any of Sirius' stuff.  XM still has to run.  It still has to have good programming.  I mean, they can't just talk about it.  No one is going to notice the people that are fired from Sirius.  It's going to be all about how many people were fired at XM.  And there's going to be a lot, unfortunately.  Yeah.  Do we know anyone that we give a crap about, to tell you the truth?  Most of the people that we knew left. 
[02:55:00]  Let's see.  Elo, Gonzo.  Elo must be smiling ear to ear, just like I bailed at the perfect fucking time into a  great gig.  You know?  Everyone else is like, what do I do?  What do I do?  All those people, every time we went up there and saw them and said, what the fuck do they  do?  Gone.  Steven S. from Bayshore wrote the headline, you motherfuckers.  Serious firings going on at XM.  Ah, that is a good one. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah, that's the headline.  All right, we'll take a break.  We'll continue.  Do you know the name of this show?  It's called Douche the Audience.  Yeah.  I should tell the fine folks out there a little bit about Opie and Anthony.  Agree, agree.  Laugh, laugh, laugh.  Laugh, laugh.  Agree.  Agree, laugh.  This is awful.  Please like me.  Please like me.  Please like me.  Audio diarrhea.  Agree, agree.  Laugh, laugh.  Laugh, laugh.  Agree.  Agree.  Laugh, laugh.  Time to agree.  Agree.  Agree.  Please like me.  Please like me. 
[02:56:00]  Agree.  Agree, agree.  Laugh, laugh.  Oh, this is just horrible to listen to.  I better laugh so people think what was just said is funny.  That Opie.  Oh, Jesus.  We have no business being here.  Agree, agree.  Laugh, laugh, laugh.  Oh, just laugh.  Laugh because you're uncomfortable.  I don't know why I find that hysterical every time.  It's a hoot.  It's a hoot 100% of the time.  It's a hoot.  It's a hoot.  Logan and Anthony.  Traveling virus.

[02:57:30]  Our pal John Mayer did our show once.  Likes our show.  His brother's a huge fan of the show.  Mayer's a good guy because Ops Girl was mentioned when I said, yeah, I want to go to see John  Mayer, but I'm not sure if there's tickets available.  So I just texted Carl, his brother, who's a cool dude.  And a minute later, John just texted me back.  He goes, yeah, whatever she needs.  Like, he really, he's a fan of the show.  He's not, you know, he's not a phony.  Yeah.  John Mayer rules.  And he was great at the PNC Bank Art Center.  All right.  Hey, we got a little something, something. 
[02:58:00]  I'm Bob Slidell.  This is my associate, Bob Porter.  We're trying to get a feel for how people spend their day.  Look, so if you would, would you walk us through a typical day for you?  This is the dumbest radio show ever.  It's just people eating and trying to prepare food and making fucking dick jokes.  Would you be a good sport and indulge us and just tell us a little more?  We have no boss or prepared material.  We don't know shit.  It's gigantically ridiculous. 
[02:58:30]  The fucking clusterfuck.  What would you say you do here?  Nothing.  It's a fucking abomination.  There's no way to spin it.  Useless.  Gone.  See, that's us talking to the new bosses.  Gone.  It's a bunch of clips put together to make it sound like we don't do a good radio show.  No, that's not true, Jimmy.  Your name is Michael Bolton?  What's your favorite song?  I celebrate his entire catalog. 
[02:59:00]  That guy's a genius.  Are we a bit distracted today, do you think, with this merger thing?  Ah, merger.  Can't get my one on the phone.  There's a great...  Oh, let me finish my pretzel, but I'll tell you.  Oh, okay.  Don't mind me.  It's American Psycho Talk 101.  Ooh.  All right.  We'll move on to some material.  Listen to this guy.  Ever been so angry at your lawnmower you've wanted to shoot it?  No.  No.  Let me think.  I mean, no.  Because I've never asked my lawnmower for my blowjob and heard no. 
[02:59:30]  What an ass.  Lawnmower never got lippy.  I think I knocked a lawnmower over once.  Maybe kicked it.  Yeah, you get, like, mad if it doesn't start.  Right.  That's the big thing.  It's like...  You're like...  Ah, come on.  I pushed one in.  There's no gas in it.  I pushed one into the woods once.  Out of frustration.  Yeah.  But, no.  Ever been so angry at your lawnmower you've wanted to shoot it?  I have one time.  Yeah? 
[03:00:00]  Because I was in my living room and all of a sudden the lawnmower...  ...came in and started cutting my shag rug.  And I really was looking for my gun.  Ever been so angry at your lawnmower you want to fuck it in the exhaust pipe and rape it?  You ever want to take a shit in your lawnmower's mouth?  Ever been so angry at your lawnmower you've wanted to shoot it?  Police say 56-year-old Keith Walandowski has.  He's now in jail over it.  I heard the gunshot. 
[03:00:30]  And then all the cops are out.  Then they hauled him away.  It happened Wednesday morning.  Court...  It happened...  That's fucking guy.  It happened...  It happened...  It happened...  Oh, wait, I...  It happened...  It happened...  Then they hauled him away.  It happened Wednesday morning.  It happened...  It happened...  It happened Wednesday morning.  Oh, my God. 
[03:01:00]  It happened Wednesday morning.  Court documents say Walandowski, who lives in this house with his elderly mom, took a sawed-off shotgun and blew a hole in his lawnboy lawnmower.  That frightened a woman who lives with it, too.  She called 911.  When he's sober, he's just a quiet guy, he doesn't seem to, you know, do much of anything.  Neighbors like Russ Beenex say Walandowski's a good neighbor when he's not drinking.  But...  You gotta love it. 
[03:01:30]  When he's not drinking.  Wow.  Too much of anything.  Neighbors like Russ Beenex say Walandowski's a good neighbor when he's not drinking.  But next-door neighbor Donna Cadow says that's not very often.  He's always drinking.  That's normal for him.  That's his life.  Why did you tell the neighbors to go fuck themselves?  You know, what a bunch of just butt-in skis.  He's a nice guy when he's not drinking.  Then the other neighbor's like, yeah, but he drinks pretty much all the time.  He drinks all the time.  So what?  Leave him alone. 
[03:02:00]  The guy likes drinking and firing a few rounds off at his lawnmower.  It's a problem.  Makes suburbia a bit exciting for you all.  Yeah.  Go fuck yourselves.  Sounds like a familiar story, too.  Wow.  What?  What?  Some people get annoyed at things and fire a few rounds at it?  Allegedly.  I've heard of people doing that.  They get angry at machines, things like that.  It's silly, though, because it's an inanimate object that isn't going to feel it.  I wonder if you start off with shooting your lawnmower, or do you try talking and then 
[03:02:30]  putting it in a corner, then eventually spanking, and then you realize you're getting gas  on your hands, and then you decide to shoot it?  Or perhaps the lawnmower wants to have a little talk with you and brings a little paper bag  with it, and then pulls it out of the paper bag and shoots itself.  It could happen.  Hard bud, do I have a lawnmower joke?  The little pull cord flies off the top.  Dummy.  I was like, where the fuck is he going with this one?  Oh, hard bud, lawnmower.  That's funny. 
[03:03:00]  Hey, let's say hi to Coke Logic.  Coke?  Who?  Coke Day Logic.  Ever get so mad at your PC you wanted to shoot it?  Oh, never, but I can see that happening.  Hey, we've heard rumors.  That sounds like a good animation.  All right, we got a second audio clip here.  And the criminal complaint says Walandowski appeared to be intoxicated when he shot up the  mower.  He told the officer he got upset because the mower wouldn't start.  So in his words, I got my shotgun and shot it. 
[03:03:30]  He continued to say, I can do that.  It's my lawnmower and my yard.  So I can shoot it if I want.  If he's shooting at his lawnmower, what if the bullet would have strayed somewhere, you  know, ricocheted or whatever?  You know.  I would have killed an innocent weed whacker.  You know.  Or perhaps a mulcher.  He said he shot his lawnmower.  He was drunk.  He thought it was his wife.  He was making a whole lot of noise. 
[03:04:00]  He said the same sound.  Shut up.  When your wife sounds exactly like your lawnmower, it's time to shoot her.  It really is.  He thought you was coughing.  Shut up.  I'm going to sleep.  Oh, you mouthy hole.  Pipe down, would you?  Yeah.  I've been that angry, though.  Yeah. 
[03:04:30]  Common sense steps in.  Yeah.  You just kick it real hard.  Yeah, sure.  You don't pull out the gun, right?  Of course not.  Who's the reporter?  Alan Sniffen?  Come on.  Come on.  Very good.  That's what?  Pure smart.  Let's go with this.  Company makes mandals.  Candles for men.  What the fucking...  I thought mandals were sandals, like...  What?  Like mandals.  They're like almost sandals, but...  For men?  Yeah. 
[03:05:00]  I don't know.  Mandals.  The key to this, you know that dumb show Fox?  I got a mandal.  It's right between my legs.  Grab onto the mandal around front.  That's right.  Pull it hard enough, and then chocolate pudding shoots out the back.  Would that be funny if you had this thing where every time someone tugs your cock, you  just shit violently how horrible your fucking dating life would be?  And you didn't realize there was a connection until you were like six girls in, and you're 
[03:05:30]  in the car, and she just grabs your dick and tugs once, and shit just blurbles out onto  your bucket seats.  God damn it.  And then once you identify that it is that problem, how do you approach a girl that you  care about, and you're going, look, I do have this problem.  I know we're ready to, you know, take this to the next level sexually.  I just have to let you know something about me.  And then as you're fucking her, and as you start to cum, it just starts bubbling out of 
[03:06:00]  your ass.  Fucking fucking...  What was that Daniel Day-Lewis movie where he was finding all that oil?  Let there be blood?  That's what your fucking asshole looks like.  Oh, shit.  Every time you cum, shit fires out.  What an awful affliction to have.  Oh, talk about a dilemma.  Girls blowing you, and you're like, I don't like her that much.  She's got a fucking neck full of treats.  You got Pat from Manaki. 
[03:06:30]  He writes, I shot the lawnmower, but I didn't shoot the weed whacker.  Oh, Christ.  Just shoot him.  All right, here we go with the Mandels.  Oh, yeah, the key to this, that dumb show Fox and Friends, they're reporting this as  a real thing, and it's a fake internet commercial.  No way.  Yeah, so, let's listen to this.  A guy has said he's had it with all the female-smelling candles around the house.  You know, I don't know what you have, like, butterscotch and all that garbage. 
[03:07:00]  Lavender.  Lavender.  Lavender, yeah.  Well, a guy has now invented manly candles with such scents as leather.  Ew.  Bacon.  Ew.  Hunting lodge.  Hunting lodge.  What?  Cunt.  What?  Salmon.  How stupid are these people?  They actually believed this, and it was just a scam?  Yeah, it's a fake internet commercial.  Like leather?  Hunting lodge.  What?  What?  What does that smell like?  Just wild animals?  Yeah.  It just smells like sweat in gym socks. 
[03:07:30]  Why?  Men don't like those smells stupid.  That's why we have cologne.  Right.  And leather's a nice smell.  You shower and put on deodorant.  Hunting lodge is a nice smell.  Yeah.  It's all farts and glass.  Shut up.  Fucking assholes.  It's not what men like.  Animals?  Yeah.  It just smells like sweat in gym socks.  Did you mention yard work?  I didn't mention yard work.  Yard work is one.  You know what?  They're working on a beer scent.  It's good.  But all they've got...  They are zany. 
[03:08:00]  A little too zany for their own good.  Oh, my God.  All they've got...  All they've got so far is the smell of...  They're called Mandels.  They're called Mandels.  They're called Mandels.  The Manly Man Candle Company is in Montana.  Power, Montana.  Check out their website.  That's what you're seeing right here.  Wait a minute.  Go back.  Oh, we can't go back.  Wait a minute.  I think I said urinal cake.  Did you see that urinal cake?  Look at that one that we're stomping on. 
[03:08:30]  What?  Dog?  Charcoal?  This is fake.  Yeah, they're not getting it.  There's...  Urinal cake?  That's stupid.  Is that what you want?  Urinal cake scent?  And the thing is, it's not like I was watching Fox and Friends and saw this.  It's not like I was on the Fox website.  Like, Yahoo News was reporting this as a story.  People...  Like, you know, whatever state it was supposed to...  Montana Company, you know, selling man candles.  Yeah.  So I'm like, oh, that's interesting, because I figured, oh, for the show, you guys could 
[03:09:00]  come up with your own, you know, what man candles might be purchased.  And then I'm realizing as it's going on, I go to their website, because I'm like, urinal  candle...  Like, there's no way that's real.  So I go to their website.  There's no contact information.  There's no order information.  It just forwards you to, like, a video site with, like, a gag commercial.  Yeah.  Like, didn't anybody do that?  No.  Like, no.  You know what they do now?  And this is the truth.  Interns gather the news.  And give them a big list, and they pick out what stories they want. 
[03:09:30]  Shh.  And then interns...  Yeah.  No, that's why interns should just be relegated to getting fucking food.  Shh.  Getting the fucking food.  Not going and preparing network news.  Sorry.  Well, what about radio shows?  Or radio shows.  They're dummies.  We all know they're dummies.  Wait to hear the hole on this Fox and Friends and what she has to answer.  Oh, boy.  You're an old deodorizer.  Bowling alley?  Is locker room coming up?  You guys, this is disgusting. 
[03:10:00]  Would you put one of these in your house?  Oh.  Oh, wow.  Guys.  Guys.  Now.  This is disgusting.  What's disgusting about it?  How about the female scents?  Should we cover them?  Like, one is scrubbed toilet, and one is coppery tampon?  Fuck up.  Stupid woman.  No, guys.  Guys, this is disgusting.  Way to stop the fun, honey.  It was ambusol for that loose tooth when she got a little lippy. 
[03:10:30]  Shut up.  Ambusol.  Quiet lady.  Why does this one smell like ambusol?  Oh.  Put some of this on.  It's funny.  It smells like way too much face cream under one eye.  It smells like the sour breath one gets when they make a panicked phone call.  How can we make the smell of too scared to leave?  How about the scent of, I got hit by a doorknob? 
[03:11:00]  You know, it smells like a cold meatloaf.  Oh, guys.  Guys, now.  Why did she have to pipe in and ruin everything?  Room coming up?  You guys, this is disgusting.  Would you put one of these in your house?  Of course not.  I have a man in my house.  You don't need the smell of things?  I don't need a smellier thing.  What do you mean funny is you say?  You missed it.  I don't need a smellier thing. 
[03:11:30]  She has a man in her house.  I don't need a smellier thing.  That's right.  Just castrate him and degrade him as a stink fucking monster that roams around your house  without a dick.  She has a smellier thing.  It's that fucking Sandy Duncan eye between her legs.  What do you think?  That's all petunias and roses?  Fucking wizard sleeve.  I like that one.  Fucking, as you're PMSing and you're nervous and angry.  You don't know that fucking becomes like a swamp.  I don't need that. 
[03:12:00]  That's right.  That man stinks.  Like what?  His secretary, you dummy?  Well, how about that fucking awful, that cottage cheese box he was dipping his fucking  dick into?  Maybe that's why your man smells, because you have another yeast infection, you fucking  monster.  Fucking old cool whip twat.  Exactly.  Hey, fucking cream cheese pussy, you're the problem.  You're the problem.  Oh, fuck.  I have a man already.  That's it.  My cock comes out looking like a parfait.  Is that the worst, picking those smelly things out of your pubes? 
[03:12:30]  It looks like you fucked a stuffed shell.  What the hell is that?  A stuffed shell.  Oh, that's exactly.  I got some out of my car.  Yeah.  Either you're a great chef or your cunt's got a problem.  Fucking awful is that?  And you're fucking, you look down and you see the milky white.  Yeah.  And you don't even want to pull your dick out because your hand will smell.  It's like the corners of my old math teacher's mouth.  Excuse me, honey. 
[03:13:00]  Is your pussy manic depressed?  Your pussy's on fucking, on Haldol.  Can I, that emasculating bitch.  Yeah.  I've already got a man around the house.  I got something that's so smelly, something smellier.  Pat from Menachie.  What's the smell of, we would have named it Billy?  There you go.  Tears and copper.  That's it.  A little hard to find the wick on that candle, isn't it? 
[03:13:30]  Exactly.  Just a red, round candle.  Looks like a red candle left on the stove, too close to the stove.  That's from the Boohoo collection.  You put it in the little dumpster candle.  You light them both together.  And you put that next to the husband, the husband cheering candle. 
[03:14:00]  It's got two pumped fists raised up in the air.  The old crying grandparents candle.  Well, let's go back to the hall and see what she adds to this discussion.  Locker room coming up?  You guys, this is disgusting.  Would you put one of these in your house?  Of course not.  I have a man in my house.  And you don't need to smell it?  I don't need a smellier thing in the house than a husband. 
[03:14:30]  I went through the newsroom to try to find a candle that would be a manly candle.  This is all that we had down there.  It was a martini-shaped Cosmo.  I thought it was a fruity drink for me.  Which is perfect for Dave.  Which is nice.  That is so gross.  Who needs a candle that smells like a sweaty shirt?  Or stale beer?  Manly candles.  Or dirty socks?  No, thank you.  Or dirty socks?  No, thank you.  Boy, her husband must have just fucking...  How does it...  Does he watch that?  Watch her on TV and just go, you fucking bitch. 
[03:15:00]  I'd have...  The only way I could watch her doing that is if, like, the neighbor was bent over in front  of me and you're just fucking the neighbor's wife watching her emasculate you.  Really?  I smell?  Let me just shoot a load across her back while I watch you work.  Why is he so dirty?  What does he do for a living?  He fucking...  He digs graves in the Mojave Desert.  And he has no fan.  His fan is broken.  His fan is broken.  I could just be out there with an oscillating fan with a really long extension cord. 
[03:15:30]  I'm throwing hotter air on him.  In the Mojave Desert.  Why are they burying people there?  I don't know.  It's probably cheaper.  Fucking behind a cactus.  Are you sweaty, dirty socks?  How about doing some laundry, bitch?  Yeah.  It would be funny if you said, I already have a man.  I don't need a candle to rape me.  I hate her.  Oh, fucking adding nothing.  He stinks.  Just the worst.  What a dope.  Oh, God.  This is gross. 
[03:16:00]  Shut your fucking mouth.  This is...  All right.  We're going to play a little catch up.  How do you think we feel about that fucking hair on your nipples?  Do you think we like that?  You think we don't notice that?  It's like fucking licking Charlie Brown's head.  We tolerate it, don't we?  Oh, fuck.  That fucking one long hair on the nip.  Snip that already.  Fucking mouse nose.  A couple of whiskers.  She could tell us she could fit through the doorway.  If the whiskers hit the edge, don't go. 
[03:16:30]  Hey, we're getting to the bottom of this.  Chester's liver from RadioGoldFans.com.  She's upset because her husband bought the candle that smelled like 18-year-old vagina.  All right.  Hey, some of the stories we didn't get to last week because we had a very busy week.  This one made us laugh pretty hard, so let's present it to the peeps.  Take a close look at bear attack victim Elena Hansen.  Her face is covered in gauze as she's rushed to the hospital, and her journey to this point is an amazing story. 
[03:17:00]  She was walking in the wilderness in Kern County's mountains when a bear charged at her.  Her two dogs tried to protect her.  They obviously took on the bear to give her some time to get away.  The dogs took off running after the attack.  I improv'd with the dogs.  Yes.  Hello.  She made fun of my improv skills, so I mauled her.  The pendulum is swinging back the other way. 
[03:17:30]  After the attack, and Hansen got away in her car, now covered with bloodstains.  Come screaming down the road and blowing her horn.  And as the vehicle approached closer, I could see the driver's face was bloody. 
[03:18:00]  But firefighter Eddie Childs had no idea what had happened.  She pulled up right here, got out of the vehicle, and said that she was frantic, and she said that she just got attacked.  And I told her to wait here so I can get some additional information.  And then that's when she jumped in her vehicle.  And took off because you weren't helping her.  But head off.  Still in shock and covered in blood, Hansen drove two miles down the treacherous Paiute Mountain Road. 
[03:18:30]  Desperate for help, she came here.  What made it treacherous?  It's treacherous because she's bleeding.  It's just a dumb mountain road.  What makes the road treacherous?  Boy, that one first guy must have really been a help for her to hop back in the fucking car and drive away bleeding.  He's asking all kinds of stupid questions.  Bigger than a bread box?  Asshole bleeding.  I was eaten by a bear, dummy.  Could you fucking get a bandage?  Right. 
[03:19:00]  I like the fact they say, and he didn't know what was happening.  How could he know?  She's driving up with a bloody face.  What would he know?  Unless the bear's sitting in the passenger seat, munching on her arm.  Yeah, or unless her fucking, her license plate was B.R. Provoker.  Oh my God, that's that lady that pokes bears in the balls and runs quickly.  What has happened to her?  B.R. Provoker.  I don't know why I abbreviated bear. 
[03:19:30]  And not provoker.  And left her provoker.  Long license plate.  I just made a quick comedic decision that there's no way to abbreviate.  I was with P.R.V.K.R.  People are like, what?  Provolone.  Breaking news from Travis.  Yes, Travis.  I hate to throw Danny under the bus.  Oh, sure you don't.  No, you don't.  No, you're right, I don't.  I ran in here.  But manly candles are real.  Danny went to the wrong website.  What?  Well, here's the thing.  It is misleading, and I'll agree with Danny a little bit. 
[03:20:00]  But if you want.  All those scents are real.  Urinal cake.  Yeah.  No, they're not.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Now you're being silly.  See, what I tried doing this morning when I was looking for show materials, I saw the  story and I said, this is ridiculous.  Let me research this further.  So I threw mandals or man candles, what have you, into some search engines, and I yielded  a result, which was a fake website with a commercial.  And it's the same website that I saw Fox running.  Aha. 
[03:20:30]  But it turns out there actually is a manly man candle company that does make manly man candles.  And those are the candles that they were showing on the report.  And the scents.  We order some?  Yeah.  So let's order them.  Danny and Fox News just got the wrong website.  I don't believe it.  But.  Oh, Sam.  Oh, Sam is coming in now.  This is a whole cluster fuck.  It's not the same.  It's a different scents.  Different scents.  They don't have the urinal scent on there.  Do they?  Yeah.  On what?  The fake site?  Or the real site.  Or the real site.  Real candle. 
[03:21:00]  I could get urinal cake candle.  Oops.  Yeah.  No, I don't think you're.  It's shaped like a urinal cake.  I think you're lying to me.  Here's some of the real candles that you can buy from the manly man candle company.  Hunting Lodge, Leather, Coffee Shop, Wild Alaska, Irish, Springtime, Cedar Forest, Alpine,  Yardwork, Clean Laundry, Grandma's Cooking, Berry Pancakes, and Pina Colada.  All right, see, that's like regular kind of whatever manly things.  Pina Colada.  But not fucking urinal cake.  Urinal cake. 
[03:21:30]  Or dirty sock.  Or bowling alley.  Like you were reporting on Fox.  Side of balls.  Yeah.  Ball crevice.  Onion bag.  That awful when you fucking just keep sniffing it.  You can't not sniff.  You don't want to touch your tongue to it.  It's like a battery.  That fucking awful underarm smell on your bag.  I love my own ball smell.  Like when you.  You know how you know you got a good dose on your finger?  A dose.  You got to get it under the nose. 
[03:22:00]  How?  No.  No, I mean, I'm not saying you know how you know, but you know what I'm saying.  Oh, when you get a good dose on your.  It's like you don't even move the ball.  What I'll do is I'll fish my hand out.  Like right now, I'm touching my balls.  And I have my thumb.  My thumb is holding the ball to the side.  My three other fingers are on the leg.  And then my pointer finger goes, allow me.  And he moseys on down between the crack.  And I nudge back and forth.  And I pull out.  And I have no smell right now at all.  I'm very clean. 
[03:22:30]  I have none.  No ball smell.  None.  A little oil because I jerked off last night.  I did.  I fucking.  It was a sick shooter all over my stomach.  Why did you jerk off last night, Jimmy?  I don't know.  It's just nothing else to do.  Bored.  I couldn't think of any good Bob Saget roast jokes.  So I punished myself.  Time to jerk off.  Yeah.  Let's get back to this bear mauling.  Mountain Road.  Desperate for help, she came here to Fire Station 78.  When Leigh walked into the station, clearly was, you know, a bear attack victim.  Tried to keep her calm. 
[03:23:00]  Tried to stop as much as bleeding as possible.  And tried to keep her stable.  Got one of the guys in a bear suit to come downstairs.  They were amazed by her will to live.  Considering the injuries that she had to her, it's pretty amazing that she was able to coherently  drive down the mountain and find her station and actually still come in and be able to  talk to us.  Then searchers launched into action, combing miles of this rugged terrain looking for the  bear.  But it was the dogs who tried to defend their owner that were found with scratches left from 
[03:23:30]  the mauling.  Went to see who got damaged.  And it looks like both dogs are okay.  Thank heavens.  Now people in this tight-knit community, including the victim's best friend, are praying for  their neighbor's recovery.  Stunned that a woman so in touch with this picturesque wilderness has now fallen victim  to it.  What kind of faggot bear is that?  That a woman and two dogs get the best of them?  Yeah.  Jesus, you couldn't kill two dogs and a chick?  Chases them away.  Also when there is that term tight-knit community. 
[03:24:00]  Tight-knit community.  Every community is tight-knit.  There's no such thing.  Do you talk to your neighbors?  Huh?  Fuck that.  I don't know my neighbor's name, although I did see my other neighbor, Bruce Willis,  yesterday.  What?  Really?  Yeah.  You don't have...  He's not your actual neighbor.  Well, no.  Is it the Bruce Willis from the movies or just some guy named Bruce Willis?  Well, it's from the movies.  We went to get on the elevator together.  Yeah?  And what happened?  His security...  I had all my gym stuff on.  I really do smell like vinegar after I work out.  So you didn't want to be smelly in front of Bruce Willis?  He was with his fucking 10 girlfriend, the model. 
[03:24:30]  She's amazing.  And so I nodded at him, and he kind of nodded back.  I used to be polite.  But then I got on an elevator, and I thought he was going to get on mine, but then another  one opened.  And I wanted to double back, but I couldn't without being obvious.  Aw.  He kind of faked me out.  Gee.  So I was alone in the elevator.  All right.  Wow.  That would have been good.  A little elevator conversation with Bruce Willis?  Yeah.  I would have said, hey.  And he would have said, hey.  See?  Conversation.  I told you one time I got into a fucking...  I got into a cab that he was getting out of, and that's the whole story. 
[03:25:00]  Yeah.  But I'm so pathetic.  If I ever talked to him, I would mention it.  Remember?  Like, dude, you got it out of a cab, and I got in.  Remember?  You know how that happens sometimes here in New York?  Yeah.  Die hard.  Yeah.  I'm just a flop.  A violent crime with an unusual ending, and the gangbangers apologized after the attack.  The man beaten, stabbed, and sent to the hospital.  And not only did the attacker say, sorry, apparently they offered their victim a ride 
[03:25:30]  to the hospital.  Yeah.  You really don't see this sort of thing every day.  That's nice.  No kidding, you don't see this sort of thing every day.  Well, they finally get a little common sense and think, uh-oh, we might have a murder rap  here.  Right.  Sort of thing every day.  Modesto police telling us that they have four suspects here.  These four guys, we're told, were very upset that someone went and busted out the windows  of their car.  So what do they do?  They find a house where they think the guy who did it is.  They bust on through the door.  They're looking for revenge, but they leave with only regret. 
[03:26:00]  I heard a person just say, you know, he's in the house, and that woke me up.  When I ran down the stairs, I see three guys already on top of my friend.  Kicking, punching him.  He goes, he broke our windows to the car.  He goes, no, I didn't.  I was trying to tell you guys that, but you guys started pounding on me.  The gangbangers realize they've got the wrong guy.  That's when they try to help the victim, pounding, pummeled, and in pain.  And he goes, turn around.  I want to see you back.  For what?  He goes, I have no weapons.  He goes, it's not bad.  It's because my friend just stabbed me.  He goes, what? 
[03:26:30]  Exactly.  That's the reaction we were hoping for from the audience today.  Yeah.  But the thing is, how did they realize the guy didn't do it?  Because he said, I didn't do it.  Yeah.  Like, what guy would go, oh, yes, that was me.  Yes, I did that, and I'd do it again.  That's right.  I just fucking Reeboks being put in your jawline.  Stabbed in the back, a deep wound, now dripping blood.  And I'm just looking at this long, thin knife.  And I go, oh, my God.  Suddenly, criminals with a conscience.  And he goes, oh, man. 
[03:27:00]  He goes, I'm sorry.  And he's like, if you want, we'll take you to the hospital.  And I'm looking at him like, what?  This is really what gangs have to offer our community, is these senseless acts of violence.  Before I just throw two broken windows, you're going to stab a person.  The four guys take off, but not before taking another stab at an apology.  And he's like, I'm sorry.  And he hugs me, and I'm like, what?  Really?  At least they fucking, look, first of all, I'm on the gangbanger side on this one.  Yeah.  Someone breaks your windows. 
[03:27:30]  Wouldn't you want your friends to go in and stab them?  Of course you would.  And then they get the wrong guy, and they're like, all right.  They stabbed the wrong guy.  Yeah, silly us.  Obviously, somebody's a good friend.  And the only reason they took him to the hospital, so while they're there, they could get an AIDS test.  Jesus.  The fuck was that guy trying to fool?  Come on.  Yeah, there's some realistic here, Henry.  They stabbed the guy in the asshole, and the knife just disappeared.  His asshole, it opened up like horse lips and grabbed the knife. 
[03:28:00]  You're going to have to do better than that, sweetie.  Yeah, sounds like the neighbor was looking for a gangbanging himself.  Yeah, when I heard gangbangers were coming in.  Ooh.  Ow.  I quickly showered and got ready.  Wow.  There's a blast in Istanbul.  I got a call yesterday from fucking Steve.  Steve.  Steve Wigg.  He's the guy who's Lars' assistant, and his buddy Joey, who works for Metallica, 
[03:28:30]  the one that kind of got us up on stage at Bonnaroo.  Look at you.  And they called me from Istanbul yesterday.  Fucking, now there's a bomb there.  Yeah.  That bit doesn't mean anything.  I'm just hoping that they weren't near it.  Yeah.  Of course.  Would you just tell that story over there?  Is that what happened?  But it wasn't a punchline story.  No, of course it wasn't.  It was a story to galvanize people into action.  It's okay, Jimmy.  I understand.  I just realized that where my friend called me from, there was a bombing.  But I don't know what I was doing.  I like guns. 
[03:29:00]  I love being armed.  Are you insane?  No.  You know, some girls actually enjoy having a gun put to their head while you fuck them.  Shut up.  Shut up.  He's nuts.  He's just fucking nuts.  Ah, man.  Heading toward line of the day.  This is crazy.  Still trying to get Don Wicklund on the phone.  Where are we at with that, Steve? 
[03:29:30]  Good luck.  Come on, man.  You know what happened last time?  What happened?  That was when we were trying to get Logan on the phone.  What happened?  And it turned out he was no longer with the company, pretty much.  Yeah.  Do you miss Logan?  Not at all.  No?  I don't yet, but I will.  We haven't talked to him in so long, anyway.  Yeah.  Let me talk to the guy.  No, I'll miss, like, hanging out, drinking, but he hasn't done that in a while, anyway.  Long time. 
[03:30:00]  All right, we got one more thing before line of the day.  Mr. T, his Snickers bar commercial.  One of my favorite ELO things was when, after we did, was it Letterman, I believe, and we  went back to watch it in Bob Eatman, our super agent, Bob Eatman's hotel room.  And, um, me and Logan emptied his minibar.  And you know how Bob is.  He's, uh, what they call thrifty. 
[03:30:30]  He's a cheap Jew.  Right.  And he would not even take anything out of the minibar.  Minibars, everyone knows.  They're a ridiculous markup.  It's, I don't know why, but they figure, for the convenience of putting it in something  in your room, they can mark it up 800%.  I don't know why that is, but that's just the minibar.  Uh, so Bob would never take anything out of there.  I think he, uh, he forces his wife to get snacks.  Yeah.  He's the one, right? 
[03:31:00]  Yep.  Someone told me this story.  I think it's Bob.  Forces his own wife to buy snacks before they go, before they go to a hotel.  So she doesn't go into the minibar.  Into the minibar.  Gosh, you could just grab some chips and stuff.  It's called convenience.  Yeah.  You do it for the convenience of it.  You walk in there and it's three in the morning and you open it up and there's a bag of famous  Amos cookies.  Fucking A.  $37.  Yeah.  37 bucks was well worth it.  But, uh, so we went through all of Bob's booze and beer and everything. 
[03:31:30]  I can only imagine it was in the hundreds of dollars worth of booze that we drank out of  his minibar.  And he was, he was there watching us do it, getting all nervous and shaking, but he couldn't  say anything cause he didn't want to appear cheap and we were celebrating something kind  of cool.  And he could tell that he was freaked out.  Oh yeah.  And me and Logan are just like, yeah.  I'm like, yeah.  Elo, what do you want?  Another one?  Amstel.  All right.  We're just cracking them open.  Poor Bob is there having a nervous breakdown.  Well, cause Bob got the best of Elo with our negotiations.  So Elo got him back. 
[03:32:00]  Remember after Letterman, the $2,000 bottle of wine first, pulling that off on him first.  He forced Bob to buy a $2,000 bottle of wine in celebration of our Letterman appearance.  And under the guise, oh, we'll split this.  We'll split this dinner bill.  Nope.  Maybe the wine wasn't $2,000.  Maybe the whole bill was.  I don't know.  But it was way up there.  I think the bottle of wine was like two grand.  Was it up there?  Yeah, it was ridiculous.  And it tasted just like any other wine.  Eh, it was good. 
[03:32:30]  Yeah, it was good.  What are you going to say, though?  Two grand?  You know the story that Bob refuses to let die is the famous Anthony Lobster story.  Yeah, yeah.  He mentioned that the other day again.  I got like a fucking five pounder.  No, no.  I think it was way more than that.  Was it?  Yeah.  An eight?  It was 30 some odd dollars a pound.  And we went to his place and they said, look, we're out of the two pound lobster again.  Yeah, yeah.  So he could either get the pound lobster or the 10 pound.  It was something ridiculous.  Something ridiculous. 
[03:33:00]  Or the lobster with Down syndrome.  Yeah, that's exactly what it was.  Had a little Moe wig on.  So Anthony looks at Bob and we were frustrated that there was no movement in our careers after  we fucked up.  Looked at Bob and looked at the waiter and went, I'll take the 10 pound lobster.  Take me the 10 pounder.  They brought this fucking thing over there.  It was ridiculous.  Bob just almost had a heart attack.  Snickers, Mr. T's speed walking commercial that got pulled globally because people complained  it was homophobic after airing it in the UK. 
[03:33:30]  I like your Snickers bar.  Just don't stick it on my ass.  Because I ain't no fag.  I like to put it in my mouth, but I bite it quick so it don't feel like a dick with little  lumps on it.  The 18, that stands for ass.  I don't like ass.  One too many.  I suck on my Snickers bar hoping it don't have a cream filling.  Because that'd be gay.  And I don't like the gay.  I like a Snickers bar with two Reese's Pieces on my chin. 
[03:34:00]  I pity you, fool.  You a disgrace to the man race.  It's time to run like a real man.  Take that, speed walker.  Do it again, sucker.  And that's going to be trouble with the capital, Mr. T.  Snickers.  Get some nuts.  Get some nuts.  The speed walker guy was really effeminate.  He's speed walking. 
[03:34:30]  You ever see people speed walk?  And he's really moving his ass a lot, like shaking his ass.  And he's in little shorts.  And he's speed walking very faggily.  And Mr. T comes rolling out like something out of the A-Team, because that's kind of what  this whole thing is a goof on.  And fires his Gatling gun with Snickers in it at the apparently gay gentleman.  And he's speed walking.  But if gay people don't want to be stereotyped, do they have the guy being gay or saying anything?  No.  He just kind of looks very feminine in his speed walking. 
[03:35:00]  Speed walkers aren't straight guys.  No.  There was one of my high school.  Swim walkers are the best.  There was one of my high school in.  Yeah?  Speed walker?  Yeah.  So they walk backwards into things.  Speed walk backwards into fucking cucumbers.  How does he walk so fast with his hands around his ankles and his trousers down?  He dropped his trousers.  Trousers.  And his belt buckle's actually dragging.  It's not a...  Cling, cling, cling. 
[03:35:30]  Speed.  It's just backing into things.  It backs up so quickly there's little sparks from where his belt buckle's on the sidewalk.  Doorknobs and fucking corn cobs.  Whatever.  Throwing a corn cob beat where you could back into it with your asshole.  Hatch your neighborhood grocer hanging out on a shelf.  This commercial looks ridiculous actually.  Is it a tank?  That was a different one.  Oh, that's different.  Yeah, I didn't realize there was a...  Yeah, there's a bunch of them.  I haven't seen any. 
[03:36:00]  It's in the UK I guess.  Yeah, why would it be over here?  The figures they buckle and pull it.  Yeah, let's...  Fucking cowards.  Let's do a little line of the day and get the hell out of here and see if you got jobs or not.  Uh...  Oh, here's the Speedwalker commercial.  Yeah, the internet is very slow today.  Oh, what's wrong with the inner tubes?  Well...  It's like that YouTube, that little bald circle going...  It's sort of loading, loading, buffering, buffering, buffering.  Oh, here it comes. 
[03:36:30]  There's Mr. C.  See?  Guy's gay, right?  It's like...  Speedwalking!  I pity you, fool!  You a disgrace to the man race!  It's time to run like a real man!  Take that, Speedwalker!  And there's gonna be trouble!  With the capital Mr. T!  Snickers!  Get them nuts!  Mr. T's hair is looking very cotton candy-ish. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah.  He's old.  That's kind of funny, though, now.  I thought the commercial was kind of funny.  It forced the Speedwalker to run.  Yeah.  Because Speedwalking is ridiculous.  He's getting Snickers bars shot at him by a big, giant Negro.  Of course he's gonna start running.  I'm surprised the guy didn't stop because he said they were black dicks.  He's catching them in his mouth.  In his asshole.  In his speech, he doesn't drop one. 
[03:37:30]  This fucking asshole looks like a Snickers holder.  Like, you know, pens or a pen holder?  Yes.  Like the guy that broke the cigarette smoking record in Guinness Book World Records.  I hate shows right there.  Fucking A.  That's what his mouth and ass was like with Snickers bars.  Snickers bars.  His ass looks just like that guy.  All right, let's do line of the day.  Get the hell out of here.  Carbonite.com, I believe.  Right.  You still with the Carbonite?  Of course.  That's something to use to back up your computer hard drive so you never have to worry about losing any of your files.  Check it out at Carbonite.com. 
[03:38:00]  Promo code XM.  Here is a runner-up line of the day.  The house is black.  How did the birds get in?  What does your house look like?  Well, it's a little house on a stick and it just has a hole in the front.  He meant a bird house.  That's a brilliant line.  Coke Logic writes, Ope, you're killing us out here.  When are you going to have a meeting with anyone to talk about your future with Satellite?  I would imagine that they would get a hold of us soon.  They will. 
[03:38:30]  Now that the merger has gone through.  Yeah, the merger went through.  They got a clean house.  They know we got time.  We're not going to go anywhere.  They'll do the right thing.  They got to do something between now and October 1st.  They will.  They're sharpening the machetes.  We know that much.  What do we know?  The merger is going to be official sometime today.  And then by tomorrow, I would bet they're going to start lopping a lot of heads off at XM, unfortunately.  Oh, yeah.  Meaning a lot of very talented guys are going to be out of work.  That always sucks.  Hopefully, we survive and continue. 
[03:39:00]  We will.  I have no doubt.  The NAB is fucking disgusting and they fucking douche Satellite for all this time.  And now the merger finally happened and we'll be fine.  We're not going anywhere.  The NAB laughed at satellite radio, so it's funny that they spent all this time and money trying to prevent the merger  because the NAB allowed all those satellite radio commercials on regular radio back in the day.  It's amazing how fucking stupid they are.  Instead of just dealing with their own antiquated way of doing things and having some competition,  they've had the only show in town for so long and they've done nothing but fucking suck the government's dick with language restrictions 
[03:39:30]  and fucking whore themselves to advertisers.  They're disgraceful.  So, regular radio did it to themselves.  They were the only game in town and they didn't worry about the future.  A lot of guys got some big paydays.  Big paydays.  They certainly did.  And then got out of regular radio and let it just suffer and suffocate.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  Eat corn. 
[03:40:00]  We don't even have to wash our corn here.  That's how great Iowa is.  Iowa stinks.  One match would wipe your state out.  Jimmy was on fire today.  But just that dummy going, yeah, you just keep making jokes.  Like, that's what this show is about.  Fucking asshole.  You fucking emasculated fucking cracker.  He's so threatened by the black dick.  He's so threatened by the idea that his woman will fucking take one of those giant, delicious cocks in her and fucking walk away from him. 
[03:40:30]  Believe me, he jerks off to cuckold porn.  You think?  Guaranteed.  Where the husband's forced to suck it, too?  Oh, wow.  That is more than a cuckold.  Yeah, he likes the cream pie, too.  I bet he likes that bull to come in the house and fuck his woman.  And then she squats over his face and good boy cleans it.  Clean it, trucker boy.  Clean it.  Does that shit go on?  That's the sound he makes.  Yeah, but you can always tell before you fucking watch it if you're on hotmovies.com. 
[03:41:00]  There's actually a pretty, it's an interesting one.  I believe it's efuk.  That's E-F-U-K-T dot com.  Oh, yes, yes.  And the guy had gotten a black guy to come back to a hotel and fuck his wife.  But the black guy was just too excited about the whole thing.  And he comes within four seconds, pretty much, like two or three times.  And then when he finally does seal the deal, the wife takes it in her mouth and then he  starts kissing her.  It's the most disgusting thing I've ever seen. 
[03:41:30]  Wow.  It's a very freaky thing.  Kazowie.  It's the most disgusting thing I've ever watched twice.  I can't believe I came to that.  Sarah Swirls, I love.  Look her up.  She's a fucking white chick.  She just loves black dick.  But there's no guy, guy shit.  Danny's finding it now.  Can you find some Sarah Swirls?  Danny's going to find the other one.  Yeah, the other one's probably much more entertaining.  Sarah Swirls just likes black cock.  All right, as you find out, let's do another runner-up line of the day.  I don't even know what it's called.  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[03:42:00]  I'm sure they got the new logo waiting.  It's going to be called The Company We Used to Work For.  A little nervous humor.  Merger humor.  A little merger humor.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah, I found it.  It's called You Suck at Fucking My Wife.  You Suck at Fucking My Wife.  That's what it's called?  Holy shit.  Oh, that's funny.  You suck at fucking my wife. 
[03:42:30]  This guy's...  The text reads...  Proposition is a black man to fuck his wife, hoping to satisfy her desire for a huge cock.  The black man gladly agrees, but later discovers that fulfilling his role isn't as easy as he'd anticipated.  I wonder why.  Take one.  Trouble achieving erection.  They really killed this guy, don't they?  Certainly do.  Well, I mean, the audio...  I mean, obviously you seem fiddling.  Oh, he's really tugging.  Yeah, and like in the audio, you can hear the husband behind the camera going... 
[03:43:00]  Does this usually happen with you?  You know, you have problems like this all the time?  Why don't you go down on him and then climb on top of him like that?  Let's try that.  Once you get him going...  Well, look at this pig.  Once you get the back, he'll be hard.  Yeah, but she's white, I mean...  Yeah, but she's white, I mean...  And the husband's just fucking filming this. 
[03:43:30]  I don't get it.  Let's take a break.  Take two.  Premature ejaculation.  Did he come before he...  Did he just...  Yeah, he just came.  My fucking loser.  This is the director's nightmare. 
[03:44:00]  She just fucking...  She didn't even sit on it.  She got up to sit on his cock and he fucking shot his load.  That's a hell of a compliment.  Take three.  More premature ejaculation.  She's sucking his dick.  And he goes, oh, I'm coming again.  And she's, uh...  He's coming again. 
[03:44:30]  Jesus Christ.  And the husband...  Oh, the husband's...  He's got a head like Ron Howard.  I thought it was stunt brain.  The husband's right up.  Oh, he's licking the cum off of his fucking...  Off her face.  Jesus Christ.  Ugh.  What the fuck is wrong with that guy?  Now there's a video of just an empty bed.  Final act.  The husband's turn.  Oh, the husband's fucking her.  And, uh...  The other guy's now robbing their house. 
[03:45:00]  He's taking all the shit out of the minibar.  They wait.  They come to finish.  The cameras are gone.  What the fuck is that?  Is that the guy making that noise?  Jesus Christ.  But then after this, it's just...  The way that they're all just casually talking about how the guy was just fucking his wife.  Nice big caps that I can send you. 
[03:45:30]  Oh.  Of yourself in action.  I will appreciate that.  I'm going to leave here and make an appointment with my urologist.  All right.  Let's get to it.  Oh, it's funny.  Remember when you shot the load in her mouth and I, uh...  Like, lapped up your cum?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Jesus.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  Oh, okay.  So the worst noise you've ever heard.  So your door opened.  I'm here and I've got an idea.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  That was really good.  Right to the next one. 
[03:46:00]  Or perhaps the lawnmower wants to have a little talk with you and brings a little paper bag with it.  And then pulls it out of the paper bag and shoots itself.  It could happen.  The little pull cord flies off the top.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Dummy.  That's funny.  One more runner-up.  Here we go.  So A-Rod slept with Madonna.  Before that, Charles Barkley.  And before that, Dennis Rodman.  She's going to wind up with Athletes Cunt.  Whoa! 
[03:46:30]  That was awesome.  And that was on regular radio, too.  Yeah.  He blurted that one out.  Don says he's going into a meeting.  So he has been in a meeting.  He's been avoiding us.  Now he's going into one, which probably isn't good.  No.  And here is your line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day. 
[03:47:00]  Just a red, round candle.  Looks like a red candle left on the stove too close to the stove.  That's from the Boohoo collection.  The sounds of Steve.  Puddle of AIDS.  Hot Movies is so addictive.  Jimmy's going to be bleary-eyed and have arthritis in his right hand. 
[03:47:30]  I've already been to Hot Movies many times.  What's Hot Movies all about?  Is it homemade movies?  No.  HotMovies.com.  You buy an account.  And they charge you by the minute.  But believe me, 60 bucks lasts a long time.  There's thousands of movies broken down by category and everything.  And you can watch little clips of them.  And they have every major movie.  It's fucking amazing how many movies they have.  Danny, go to Categories. 
[03:48:00]  Does it have some of the...  Or Scattergories, my favorite game show.  Oh, Scattergories.  Does it have some of the fun movies from the 80s?  Like the comedies from the 80s, Jimmy?  It's probably got all of them.  Because look at that.  Oh, it's not just porn, really?  Oh, it is all porn.  But I mean, those are all porn movies broken down by category.  Amateur, anal, animation, appearance, exclusive movies, fantasies.  Big Clitch.  43 movies featuring Big Clitch.  Big Clitch.  Big Butts.  1,646 movies featuring Big Butts.  Wow.  You want fetish?  Adult Babies and Phantasm, 32. 
[03:48:30]  Amateur, 3,825.  Amputee, 2.  Not a big amputee money.  No, the drop-off there from amateur to amputee.  Yeah, because the directors for Amputee movies always hit the wrong button with their stumps.  I said we'd go with a little amputee video to end the show.  You have to join the site.  Well, of course you do.  I'm going to use up one of your minutes for the show.  And Long Jean Silver.  She's got her own stump.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:49:00]  Wow.  Someone's chewing their butt.  She's got a leg stump.  Ew, it's all like gnarled at the end.  I know.  It looks like a turnip root.  Ew.  Nice root, bitch.  She's been poking people in the shitter, it looks like.  It's fucking horrendous.  Right.  It looks like an aardvark nose.  Actually, I think I've seen a piece of this on that very same website, eFucked.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I think I showed it to you guys once before, where she's actually, I guess you'd  call it legging another girl.  Legging.  Yeah, we watched that.  Stumpfucking her.  Hey, Chester's Liver writes, hey, Ope, Hot Movies used to be a sponsor of yours that 
[03:49:30]  you did live reads for.  They were great.  Well, I guess the fucking advertising didn't work too well, if I don't remember.  They, uh, that's a good porn site, man.  It only works in windows, though.  Can we go home, Neil?  I think so.  Yeah, let's do that.  All right.  All right.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Yo, six o'clock every morning.  You waking up, yawning.  To the sound of your alarm clock alarm.  About an hour from now, you should be at your place of employment, which is annoying 
[03:50:00]  because it's so boring.  Your co-workers be talking too loud for you to ignore them.  It affects your occupational performance.  You wonder why your workload is so enormous?  Because your boss just laid off three quarters of the whole office.  People get depressed, they get ulcers from the stress that a corporate environment causes.  Regardless of how you ultimately want to solve this, it seems to me like you got one in four choices.  You can take a new job offer for more tips, stick it out a little longer or forfeit.  But my advice to anybody that wants to quit, it'll feel much better if you say it like this. 
[03:50:30]  Take this job and shove it.  Take this job and shove it.  Take this job and shove it.  I ain't working here no more, take this job and shove it, I ain't working here no more, take this job, take this job, take this job, take this job and shove it.  Yo, if your boss is a S-O-B, tell him to S-H-O-V-E, the J-O-B, put your middle finger up slowly, put it close enough to his face so he can examine it closely, say I ain't working here no more, who do you think you are? 
[03:51:00]  Rip your apron off, throw it on the floor, run to the door, to the payphone, make a toll-free call, tell your spouse what happened to where you are, so they can come and get you in the car later on, and help you search for a new 9-to-5 job.  If the unemployment line ain't that long, you can take your time for the now W-9 form, eventually you get on if you try hard enough, and you get money if you keep punching your time hard enough. 
[03:51:30]  Maybe you hate it, maybe you love it, but if you hate it, all you gotta do is get mad and tell your boss to me.  Take this job and shove it, I ain't working here no more, take this job and shove it, I ain't working here no more, take this job, take this job, take this job, take this job and shove it.  Yo, some occupations are like slave gigs, the boss's favor to get placed in something spacious, while the most hated get placed in some small cubicle spaces, or get thrown down in the basement, get your sleep so confiscated. 
[03:52:00]  You constantly waiting for a paycheck, 12 months pass by and you still ain't get paid yet.  Here's an optimistic motto, if you ever late for today, you can say you early for tomorrow.  Most 9-to-5s are hard, cause your description of the job ain't no picnic in the park.  People get hired, drink coffee to stay wired, so they don't get tired, sleep late and get fired.  You came in late, you already ate, now, you wanna take a lunch back? 
[03:52:30]  Ayo, bust it, ain't no need to discuss it, just take this job and shove it right between your buttocks.  Take the job and shove it, I ain't workin' here no more.  Take the job and shove it, I ain't workin' here no more.  Take the job and shove it, I ain't workin' here no more.  Take the job, take the job, take the job and shove it.  Opie, Anthony. 
[03:53:00]  Opie and Dopey.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. </pre>
