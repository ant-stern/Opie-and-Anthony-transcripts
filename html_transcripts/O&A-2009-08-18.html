<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

This special edition of "The Worst of Opie and Anthony" features comedian Bob Kelly as the central figure across multiple segments.  The broadcast opens with Kelly hosting a five-hour block, recounting his childhood experiences with a physically abusive stepfather, including graphic descriptions of beatings and his subsequent runaway attempt motivated by a desire for his mother's affection.  Numerous listener calls detail their own experiences running away, often highlighting their brevity and lack of planning.  The segment includes humorous tangents on Kelly's physical appearance and uses heavy profanity and vulgar language. A song is played, seemingly for ironic effect.

The show then shifts to Opie and Anthony in studio with Kelly. They attempt to play clips from Kelly's old videotapes, focusing on one they consider exceptionally awful and funny, though technical difficulties initially hinder their efforts.  The conversation meanders through topics including Kelly's upcoming Philadelphia shows, past appearances on the show, and various crude jokes and anecdotes.  A phone call with Dane Cook, who's touring with Kelly, reveals that Kelly recently suffered a severely injured knee playing football.  The hosts and Cook engage in extensive, vulgar commentary on the injury, including playing audio of Kelly's pained cries.  The segment concludes with continued discussion and jokes about the injury and an upcoming documentary about their tour, all punctuated by profanity and sexually explicit references.

A subsequent segment focuses intensely on Kelly's knee injury. The audio of his screams and exclamations is repeatedly played and analyzed, along with descriptions of bystanders' reactions.  The conversation spirals into discussions of Kelly's pain tolerance, graphic descriptions of bodily functions, and a video of an unidentified person's anus.  Kelly then recounts childhood sexual experiences, including encounters with older women and a male friend, with the hosts interjecting with jokes and commentary.  The segment ends with further discussion of the video and anecdotes about a friend's penis size and Kelly's time in rehab.

Another segment features Kelly recounting increasingly bizarre and sexually explicit childhood and adolescent anecdotes.  He details masturbation techniques, including an inventive use of a bathroom sink, and being caught by fellow rehab patients.  He then describes mutual masturbation and sexual acts with a male friend, followed by a detailed account of encounters with an intellectually disabled girl, involving forced masturbation and other sexual acts, again using significant offensive language.  The discussion shifts to an incident involving Kelly's phone being placed in "Pat from Munaki's" anus, leading to a physical altercation and a malfunctioning phone call on air.  This segment includes commercial breaks for various advertisers (GEICO, LegalZoom, health insurance, Westwood College, "Taking Woodstock," and Jamie Foxx's radio show), with the hosts frequently interrupting Kelly's storytelling.  The segment ends with further discussion of Kelly's childhood, including his nickname "Spiff" and witnessing domestic violence.

Finally, a segment features Kelly recounting his traumatic childhood involving his stepfather's violence and his mother's passive response, detailing physical abuse and an incident where a young Kelly chased his stepfather with a knife. He discusses how this shaped his emotional responses, noting his tendency to cry easily at sentimental TV shows.  He also shares an embarrassing encounter with Jerry Seinfeld.  The segment concludes with a humorous inclusion of Kelly's voiceover demo reel, featuring various vocal styles including an “angry baby” impersonation.  Opie and Anthony are not present in studio for this segment but are heard in some recorded materials; a brief phone conversation occurs at the end, discussing the voiceover demo and Kelly's tour with Dane Cook.  Kelly's sister and mother are also mentioned.

[00:28:00]  i just i wanted them  to see me  as i was leaving  but yeah i couldn't  commit to the running away  oh all right  you wanted them  to stop you  and rescue you  yeah  let's go to david and dallas  a couple more of these  david  hold on  what  i ran away  i was about eight years old  i got as far as  the neighbor's garage  fell asleep in there  there's five of us  in my family  nobody knew i was  fucking gone  here's the kicker  here's the kicker  i brought my dog 
[00:28:30]  with me  it wasn't a fucking  chihuahua  it was a goddamn  great dane  and they didn't know  either one of us  were gone  probably happy  they probably  were calling the dog  come here boy  there you go  thanks david  two more  and then we'll  move on  mike in kentucky  what's up  hey how you guys  doing  my old man  was gonna  whip my ass  with a belt  for about the  60th time  and i  i decided  that i wasn't 
[00:29:00]  gonna have it  anymore  so i grabbed  my shotgun  went on out  in the woods  i was probably  about nine years  old  i was gonna  go out there  and be  grizzly adams  and survive  on the land  yeah  i got out there  and sat around  it was in the  fall time  for about  five six hours  it started  getting dark  and i got  scared  i remember  my old man  yelling at me  when i was  in the woods  you gotta  come back  to eat  you little  thump bitch  so i was  getting hungry  and he was  right  i went on  back to the  house  and uh 
[00:29:30]  they fed me  and then he  put me in  the bedroom  there  and he  got the  belt out  whipped my  ass with the  belt anyway  it's probably  harder than  he was gonna  so you  are gonna  run away  belting on  the ass  and then it  got dark  and you  had to  turn around  i got dark  it got dark  i got hungry  and he was  right  and i probably  got it worse  than i would  have if i  just would  have hung  around  but that  was my  lesson  see i knew it  most of these  end with you  gotta go back  home but this  guy i wonder if  this is true  richie in  connecticut  tell your story  hey what's  going on

[00:30:30]  big laugh so  we missed the  next line so  the goonies  were from  washington  so i thought  i'd go live  out there  and you  know live  with the  goonies or  something  i was thinking  but um  i took uh  they caught  me in mcdonald's  because uh  there was a  cop next to  me and i  took out  like i had  like 600  bucks in  cash  and he's  like where'd  you get  that money  little fella  and they  wound up  nailing me  that way  oh that's  smart enough  to get across  country with  eight grand  dumb enough  to think the  goonies are  real  12 years old  at least i  wasn't sucking  cock under a  you missed

[01:12:00]  on  and i was sticking  my ass up in the  air  and he wanted  nothing to do  with it  which kind of  bummed me out  so  yeah i had  fucking canary  yellow european  underpants  you got a problem  with that  yeah  another thong  close  yeah that's  when i was  big fat too  so every  underwear turned  into a thong  by midday  and it was like  wide thong  yeah wide thong  enjoy  broadcasting the worst  of obi and anthony  with bob kelly  you know i had to  go to uh  i had to get a  legit massage  the other night  because i hurt  my shoulder 
[01:12:30]  so i went to  this place  right around  the corner  from the cellar  and it's an  asian place  but they're  great  no it was  real  legit yeah  oh yeah  i was in real  pain while she  was doing it  oh that means  it's good  it was like  nuts  and bobby kelly  i'm talking to  and uh  he's like  yeah dude  because his  girlfriend works  in a salon  and he has  a gay guy  massage him  why  i don't know  that's a field  day for a gay  gentleman  not on bob's body  no not on bob  you're right  what  bob kelly  has a gay  masseur  do his  massages 
[01:13:00]  and bob  recommended  to me  bob's like  the guy's  great  yeah  he knows  what a guy  wants  is he  is he  great  i would like  to know  that's all  i know  i haven't  gotten any  details from  from robert  kelly  but uh  uh bob  what's going  on with  this uh  gay uh  masseuse  masseuse  um  uh  i mean  like  nothing  just  massaging  me  yeah  but  yeah  nothing  just  massaging  we understand  that  but the whole 
[01:13:30]  concept that  you have a  gay masseuse  is a little  off bob  why is anthony  mad at me  i'm mad at  everybody today  and believe me  if you listen  after nine  you might just  hear it  because i am  livid at  certain people  at certain  companies  yeah there's  people that's  uh  slowing down  our careers  and we're  getting really  really  frustrated  a couple of  people standing  in the way  of ultimate  success  and bringing  this show  back to where  it was supposed  to be  five years ago  the biggest  radio comeback  in history  and uh  there's a couple 
[01:14:00]  of uh  a-holes  standing in the way  because we got  uh people that  don't understand  the big picture  and they will be  dealt with  bob kelly  they will be  dealt with  so what's up  bob uh  first of all  it sounds like  you're just  waking up  yeah man  i just  i just went  to bed  like an  of course  he did  he's a stand-up  comic  well bob  i threw you  under the bus  horribly  we were talking  about massages  and stuff like  that  and i was talking  about going  i was saying  that how you  have a uh  that your  girlfriend hooked  you up with  a gay gentleman  and that you  recommended him  to me  i know  and i should 
[01:14:30]  have recommended  him to you  with a wig  hi daddy  now uh  why why  you feel  comfortable  with a gay  man massaging  you  you know  what  it's very  open-minded  of you  i didn't  but uh  i lost  feeling in  my pinky  from that  driving  like i had  that  you went  to a gay  masseuse  because you  lost  feeling in  a pinky  where did he  put it bob  that made it  feel better  the shocker  let me just 
[01:15:00]  clench up  that'll help  your pinky  feel much  better  boy i feel  silly with  my arm  hanging out  like this  i'm gonna use  a weird  technique  you use  strange muscles  to massage  with  i can understand  if you lost  the entire  feeling of  your lower  half  maybe  but you lost  feeling in  your pinky  so you said  you know what  i know what  i have to  do  i have to  go to  a gay  massage  if you  were  christopher  reeve  and he  told you  you could  walk  after this  massage  then i'd  consider it  is it bad  that he massaged  me in the closet  on my knees  no  as a matter of fact 
[01:15:30]  it'd be bad  if he didn't  all right so  why the gay  massage therapist  there bob  well my  you know  my girlfriend  fucking  hey hey  we're on  regular radio  too  i hope  torgasm  isn't filled  with this  type of  potty talk  oh my god  i forgot  that you  that's all  right  free fm  now  let it rip  what uh  yeah  why the gay  masseuse  and and how  do you feel  so comfortable  and not tense  um  i well  you know 
[01:16:00]  she because  you know  i had this  really bad  problem  my half  of my arm  was numb  and i didn't  have it for a  month  and i figured  that i went  to like a  couple women  on the road  and they  didn't uh  you know  they didn't  fix it  so then  what about  a doctor  if half  your arm  is numb  perhaps you  had a stroke  you idiot  i was paralyzed  on my left  side  so i didn't  have medical  insurance  so i said  could you  rub this  out faggot  so i  Bob has 
[01:16:30]  the worst  logic  actually  this is  the truth  i honest  to god  i heard  gay men  are magical  like fairies  almost  what um  bob  so he  massaged  you  now what  was the  difference  between  his massage  and a  woman's  massage  that made  you keep  going back  i got a  hard on  all right  enough with  that  and he  did too  no  two men  becoming  excited 
[01:17:00]  that's fair  enough  now bob  really  honestly  without trying  to be mr  funny bob  kelly  what's the  difference  that makes  you keep  going back  to a  gay man  instead of  a woman  oh wow  okay ask  that question  again  what is it  about  why  you go  back to  this gentleman  instead of  going to  him  what's the  difference  between  the  massages  time and  time again  a few  times  yeah  yeah  his hands  are strong 
[01:17:30]  strong hands  so  i don't know  if you have  this and you  might want to  go to this  guy because  you sound a  little stressed  out today  yeah i am  today  um he has  very there's  trigger points  in your back  yeah one in  the very very  lower part of  your back  it's a trigger  point that  turns you gay  yeah as soon  as it's pushed  your dignity  just releases  i'm not as  worried of the  trigger point as  i am with the  magazine points  you know where  the clip goes 
[01:18:00]  wow he's really  mad  all right  well i'm just  letting you know  that there's  trigger points  in the back  on your back  and you need  this guy  who's you know  a pretty  pretty strong  man  and he uh  i needed  somebody strong  to get the  trigger points  out  is he in  shape  yeah  he you know  he had that  that kind  of  like uh  gay in  shape you know  where the  forearms  were all  veiny  oh jesus 
[01:18:30]  and you enjoy  this  did i enjoy  it  yeah  well  was that  oak  yeah  yeah  give me back  my camera  by the way  i know you  have two  and you  don't even  realize it  yet  you're the  last person  that saw  my digital  camera  give it  back  oh no  you know  what  i didn't  take your  camera  but it  is gone  you don't  leave anything  at the  cellar  and the  freaking  arabs  take it  great  i left  a light  from  well could  you tell  the people  at the  cellar  they can 
[01:19:00]  have my  camera  i need  the memory  card back  there's some  important pictures  on there  and maybe  one picture  that could  get me in  a lot of  trouble  yeah let me  work it  out  all right  that thing's  erased  you just want  the card  back  i just want  the card  back  you know  you could  probably  if jimmy  talked to  ava  you'd probably  just say  hey they want  the card  back and they  might give  it back  to you  all right  well it's not  the cellar  it might be  one of the  kitchen thieves  but you know  ava would  give it back  all right  do we have  anything with  bob kelly  here are you  are you failing  miserably today  we woke him up  too we didn't  give him enough 
[01:19:30]  lead time  yeah  we woke him up  we want to  know about  what gay man  massage  hi  you decided to  go to a gay  massage therapist  we're trying to  get something out  of you but you  seem a little  tired today bob  yeah well you  know there's not  really that much  you're going to  get out of me  when you're talking  about me getting  rubbed down by a  gay guy you know  you'd I might as  just tell you about  me getting molested  by uh my sister  oh all right  did that happen  oh you fucking  oh  sorry  you are just an

[01:22:30]  the end like that's all  folks how many sex  tapes did you make i  made i made i made a lot  of them i used to show  him to burr he'd be  like dude i don't want  to watch this dude  i see your ass dude  but uh very similar to  me not the same yeah but  yeah one was one was  great oh i showed  norton it it was just  this girl's amazing oh  she's amazing this other  one i made though this  girl she looked like i 
[01:23:00]  was just like raping  her it was her face was  staring into the camera  just not even blinking and  bouncing like looking and  then she'd like she i  think she really liked  me and the fact that i  asked her to do this  kind of annoyed her i  kept cutting well i  could i kept trying to  look you gotta act more  and cut yeah do you keep  the tape rolling when  they started crying going  i don't believe i did  this again or i told  myself i'd stop you  still have these tapes  you know what i'll tell 
[01:23:30]  you i don't know where  they are yeah i might  have a couple of the  ones but the the great  one this is the great  one and i swear to  god it was just it  was almost professionally  done uh it was it was  your citizen kane right  it really is that it  she was so perfect her  acting she never broke  character it was in one  take oh character she's  just so broad having sex  with you never saw what  you wanted to do but you  never know character she  wasn't she was my  roommate's girlfriend and 
[01:24:00]  my girlfriend was in my  room mr faber-sham but  you never saw me in it so  you could watch it what  was her motivation you  thought about the  viewers nice in my films  you never saw my face my  films in my films you  never saw my face that  way my friends could  watch it you could if you  could recognize my bush fat  then you'd know it was me  but i'd switch that up too  so you never know yeah i  hate that in a porn where  you know the guy's bush fat  it's like ah that guy's 
[01:24:30]  that's actually my films  you know what i mean i  you have to watch a lot of  porn to recognize that  yes my catalog yeah i've  bunched him up on imdb and  so what was the motivation  for this girl because she  wasn't she didn't break  character she what'd you  tell her to be i told her  she i said listen happy  right like this i said  happy i said you're in the  bathroom it's in the middle  of the night you're my  roommate's girl okay he's  sleeping my girl's sleeping in  my room i came in to go  the bathroom okay so 
[01:25:00]  she's going through the  cabinets getting something  on my aspirin i come in  i'm in my box of shorts  i'm like oh i'm sorry  and she's like no no no  it's cool i go nah i  just i i let me know  when you're done no come  on in go ahead and i go  i gotta pee wait wait be  careful what you're saying  they're gonna dump out  all right well she goes  she just basically was  like no i have brothers  and go ahead and i was  like you should oh no  this is weird she's like  stop it you know like  like don't worry about it  like almost like a guy  like come on so i was  like all right so i  start doing it she's  like oh that's nice and 
[01:25:30]  she starts jesus christ  she's like you know  sometimes i don't know  if you have but i've  thought of you have you  and she comes over and  i'm like oh i'm like  we and i'm fighting it  that's the best part my  acting was brilliant oh  was it because i look i  was a camera guy director  and actor you you did the  handheld or tripod it was  hand in the camera it was  all handheld first person  that was first first person  first person shooter i think  you should have done  i think you should have 
[01:26:00]  done it uh tripod through  the bathroom door slightly  ajar so you're almost  getting a voyeuristic look  at it and do the whole  thing over again from the  inside and intercut the two  so you could have uh it was  like yeah next time it was  15 years ago i'll see if  you can get a babysitter for  a case  so when you were holding a  20 pound old camcorder on  your shoulder  it was a big camera but i i  i it was just oh shit the 
[01:26:30]  only thing it was so sexy i  think of it now dude i used  to show people this and every  guy i showed like dude that's  a that's good that's a good  one you got to release this  one it's really good yeah so i  kept it for years in years and  i had it in my i would have to  watch it in my because it was  on the tape it was on the  high eight so you'd have to  watch it on in the camera  right yeah plug the camera  into the tv right i had it  in the thing my camera  breaks it won't eject the  tape is in i can't send it to 
[01:27:00]  the thing to go get it the  thing i can't send it to the  guy to go get it fixed because  this is in it right in the  middle like right like  halfway through it of her you  know doing her thing so i i  seriously waited a year and  every once in a while i go to  the camera and just shake it  and punch it and try to open  this you're hoping i'm hoping  that it would just open so  finally it came down to it i  had to use my camera again to  tape some dumb set that never  panned out some dumb agent that  never liked me and uh i wound up 
[01:27:30]  having to rip the tape out i i  ripped the tape out and i spent  days trying at the unscrewing  those two little screws and that  little that little flappy piece of  plastic that goes into the tape  popped out and i was like trying to  like write down notes like this  goes here that whenever you  splice those back together  whenever that part comes uh by on  on the tape and you're watching  on tv you always go oh because  it's it's it starts crinkling and  you get the the fuzz and the buzz and 
[01:28:00]  the snow on the television and you  hope it doesn't get eaten again i  couldn't do it i actually had to  throw it out well no you didn't  throw it out because actually  someone here knows uh where it is  and what's happening with it it's  out um friday wide ah friday wide  this is the portion of the opian  anthony show where you got to use  your own imagination um people are  naming the film that you did one of  them is citizen blank right wow boom 
[01:28:30]  use your imagination and uh although  we don't have the video portion uh  some of the audio did show up  i did i locked my legs but did you  guys sit down at ahead of time go  okay this is how it's gonna play out  i'm gonna do this then you do this  then i do this then you do this no  this girl was probably one of the this  is the girl that brought she just  improvving this is the girl that  brought me to the edge of like i had  to break up with this girl because 
[01:29:00]  i was probably gonna wind up like  being with a guy with her because  she wanted it this girl what's her  number her that's how dirt like i  actually oh i taught we used to  fantasize about her going with one of  my buddies and it was just her  talking to me and it would just get  me crazy oh that's right that's the  best fantasy on the planet it's  unbelievable are you how come how  come your best fantasy is your worst  nightmare yeah well because you're  because if that actually happened  you'd be so freaking but you're  like when when when bonnie doesn't 
[01:29:30]  return your calls when you call you  freak out and start like freaking out  where is she why isn't she answering  a call who well how does the next  door neighbor know what color tiles are  in my kitchen did you ever find that  one out no first of all don't bring  out that kind of crap but here's the  thing what because here's the thing  when you're with a girl you brought  it up you're right but here's no when  you're with a girl and i've never  done this but if you talk about it  fans like bobby said it's crazy  because it's a power and a control  thing if they're doing behind your 
[01:30:00]  back then you lose the power and the  control it's actually a fear of  intimacy and you want to make her the  whore that you think she is so you can  go i was right they're all whores and  i'm never going to get close to one of  these bitches  that's holy healthy thinking process  anyways i'll bradshaw  bob kelly is hosting the worst of opium  anthony hey it's the worst of opium  anthony hosted by me robert kelly we have

[01:48:00]  All right, can we play some of the Bob Kelly audio?  Of course.  Is there a Bob Kelly?  Oh, from your CD?  That's my CD.  You son of a bitch.  This is the audio that everybody has been waiting to hear.  It's so fun.  I listened to when you guys called me up on the bus, and I was on Vicodin, out of it.  Oh, you were completely out of it.  As soon as you guys were like, ah, that's cool, man.  And then you got back on with Dan, you were like, you got to get us that audio.  Just evil.  Oh, yeah.  You need the audio. 
[01:48:30]  You need to get us that audio.  Yeah, we were all caring and stuff, and it's like, oh, my God.  When can we have it?  FedExit now.  Hey, man, are you okay?  All right, cool.  Oh, the cocksucker broke his leg.  Get audio.  We want to hear it.  It's going to be funny.  You all right?  You want some brand?  Say you have some brand.  Do you have to clear that right up?  That'll clear that.  Yeah.  I want him dead.  Yeah.  Mom's got a split in the ice box.  You know, I had my eyes closed the whole time, but you know, stupid Dane had the camera lady.  She was-  You got to talk in the mic.  Yeah, Bob.  His mics are fucked up today. 
[01:49:00]  If you don't talk in the mic, you're going to not hear yourself in the replay.  I mean, we have Uni or Omni Directional, right?  Huh?  What?  I don't know what it is anymore.  Just when I got hurt, the camera lady, she was a lady.  Yeah.  You know she wanted to stop filming.  Yeah.  It was pretty bad, but you know, Dane was in the background just, you know, spinning  his hand in the air.  Keep rolling, bitch.  Keep it rolling.  Keep it rolling.  All right.  Give us the setup, Bob, once again, because we are getting new listeners every day.  Right.  Well, we're on the tourgasm with Dane.  We had a day off. 
[01:49:30]  We were playing a little touch football just for shits and giggles, as they say in Long  Island, and it started getting a little serious.  I jumped out, smoked a butt, and then one of the guys, there was like a couple plays  left, the exec producer, told me to jump back in.  I did.  This six foot three Dominican who doesn't know how to play football, he knows how to kick  a soccer ball.  We both jumped up for a ball.  He wrapped his leg around my leg, and his weight and my weight all came down on my right 
[01:50:00]  knee on a slanty hill.  And I'm not talking about a little Asian kid.  And my leg snapped backwards and snapped sideways.  And I pretty much believe I felt, on the sideways one, I think I felt my heel hit my  quadriceps.  I swear to God.  I don't know if it happened, but I think I felt my... 
[01:50:30]  Oh my God.  Yeah, dude.  That hurts.  And the sound, I mean, you could hear it.  It hurt?  Ripping.  You know what hurt?  Breaking, tearing.  It hurt like nothing.  I almost passed out.  But the visual, because I kind of felt the movement of my leg, so I had the visual that  kept repeating itself.  Yeah.  With the sound.  Yeah.  It would not stop.  I thought my bone popped out.  I literally thought my leg was probably just at my knee ripped out. 
[01:51:00]  You were going to look at it and just see, like, white bone popping out.  Yeah.  It was just going to be, you know, the Terry Fox story.  You must have had to take in, like, four Tylenol for this.  Yeah.  I must got addicted to Vicodin.  Hold on a second.  Four Tylenol aren't going to help, Opie.  Isn't Vicodin great?  Dude, I had to get off it.  You just take it and, like, the pain goes away.  It's just gone.  And you sit there in this fog, this euphoric fog where you're just, everything's cool. 
[01:51:30]  You're kind of in slow motion.  You're all tingly.  Great drug.  I was waking up shaking, though.  I had to stop.  I was waking up in the morning and my hands were shaking.  Because you needed another Vicodin.  Oh, I was.  It does make you shake and it makes you itch.  Like, my head was itching.  Really?  And it said one of the side effects could be itchiness.  Oh, I hate itchiness.  You'll itch.  But you don't care because you're on Vicodin and it's great.  I never took one.  I couldn't remember anything.  People were asking me stuff and I was just like, I don't know.  When's your next show? 
[01:52:00]  I don't know.  I don't know.  You don't know anything.  You get up to take a piss and you're all wobbly.  You can't even walk through the hallway.  Oh, it's great.  Great drug.  The dreams are pretty wild, too.  Yeah.  The dreams are like reality.  Yeah.  Nice.  Psychedelic.  So that's basically what happened.  Ope.  Okay.  Well, we got the audio.  Yeah.  Let's play a little.  Jesus.  I think we have the actual play and everything.  Really?  You have to play?  Yeah, I think so.  Unless they edited it out.  Oh, here's the play. 
[01:52:30]  Jim!  He's down your way down.  He's down.  I snapped my knee, man.  Oh, no.  I broke my knee, man.  Get 9-1-1, dude.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my fucking knee, man. 
[01:53:00]  I broke my knee, man.  Hold on.  Can I look at it?  I broke my knee, man.  Oh, shit.  I broke my knee, dude.  Dude, too?  I broke my fucking knee, dude.  I heard it break, dude.  Oh, no.  I heard my knee break, dude.  You just popped it, Bobby.  You're going to be okay.  I broke my knee, man.  I can't break my knee.  Shoot.  Hang on.  Hang on.  I broke my knee.  I broke my knee, man.  Hang on.  Relax, relax.  Fuck. 
[01:53:30]  Hang on.  Hang on.  God.  I broke my knee, dude.  Got some ice?  I broke my leg.  Hang on.  Hang on.  I broke it.  Can you try to stretch it?  I broke it, dude.  I felt it crack.  Can you try to stretch it?  No, dude.  I go and move.  All right.  Just relax.  Just relax.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Don't move it.  I'm in so much pain, dude.  I'm in so much pain, man.  I'm in so much pain.  I'm in so much pain.  I broke my knee, man.  Wait, wait, wait. 
[01:54:00]  I broke my knee.  Get some ice.  Are you getting it?  Why can't you feel it?  Are you getting it?  Let's leave this one flat.  Can we get him some water?  Hold my hand, man.  Do you want some water?  Oh, there it is.  There it is.  There it is.  There it is.  The hold my hand, man.  Hold my hand?  This is not shit on my chest.  That would have had more dignity to it.  Drop a log on me, man.  Hold my hand.  What happened, Bob? 
[01:54:30]  Hold my hand, man.  Ah.  Wow.  You know something?  You know, somebody was holding my hand.  That really conveys pain, though.  You could really hear it, that you are hurting.  Oh, is that the thing it conveys?  I thought it conveyed faggot.  Hold my hand.  Finally, man.  I have a reason to ask you this.  I really am.  Dude, don't put your dick in my mouth, man.  No, just put a robe around me and give me AZT.  Dude, I got tears in my eyes. 
[01:55:00]  Can I just say, honest to God, as soon as I said that, I thought a fucking stupid Norton.  Just as soon as I know it's being filmed.  And as soon as he let go of my hand and I was squeezing all the pain into it.  And it was taken.  And then he let go.  Whoever let go, I want to just stab in the neck.  I don't know why they let go.  And then he let go and I go, hold my hand, man.  And as soon as I said it, I go, what a fag.  I'm finished.  Well, that sounded familiar.  That was the same thing you said while you were tearing up during the midget special.  Just hold my hand, man.  Hold my hand. 
[01:55:30]  Look at her.  Isn't that sweet?  Dude, take me to Wyoming and tie me to a fence, man.  Oh, my God.  You went there.  Well, let's go to the phones.  There's a lot of sympathy coming in through the phone lines.  Let's say hi to Billy in Staten Island.  Billy!  Bob Kelly, you're a fucking queer, man.  You're absolutely right.  Hold my hand.  Mommy, Mommy, hold my hand.  You're such a queer. 
[01:56:00]  Mom!  Mom!  Mommy, where are you?  Help me.  Help me, Mom.  I'll put you down.  I'm going to work.  You faggot.  Let's go to Max in Dallas.  Max?  What's going on, boys?  Hey.  Hey, man.  Bob, you fucking pussy.  I got my goddamn knee shot off over in the Gulf War in 90.  You're laying there going, dust off, dust off instead of hold my hand, hold my hand.  That's right.  Wussy. 
[01:56:30]  Later, boys.  God bless you, son.  Guido from Morris Park.  You're one-legged ass.  I'm listening to all the amateur paramedics in the back.  I'm waiting for someone to say, get some leaves.  Right.  I love how they're arguing the play or something, and you're down on the ground.  They don't even notice yet.  Well, that's why I kept...  They're like, he's down, man.  He's down.  Yeah.  I think the reason why I kept yelling it over and over, not because I'm retarded, but I  just...  Nobody would believe me.  You know what I mean? 
[01:57:00]  And I needed them to know that I just did something bad just happened.  Don't let go, Jack.  Don't let go, Jack.  Did you hear the Dominican?  Yeah.  He's like, maybe you'll just sprained it.  Shut up, stupid.  I heard it crack, idiot.  I heard it crack in two places, you friggin' dumb Dominican.  It's your fault.  Can I say that the black guy in Apocalypse Now handled his leg injury better?  I really am a friggin', just a sensitive homo. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, quick, man.  Just take it out and put it in my mouth just for a second, man.  Did you break your leg, man, or did you break your leg, dude?  Which one is it?  By the way, coming soon to the Opie and Anthony program, I broke my fuckin' knee, man, t-shirt.  Collector's item.  But of course, fuckin' will be, you know.  Eh, sure.  F-star.  Well, let's go back to the tape.  We have plenty of audio soon as we get to.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  And I backed it up just a little bit. 
[01:58:00]  Good boy.  You got it here, hold my hand.  Of course we do.  Get some ice.  Yeah.  You getting it?  Thanks.  Let's just leave this one flat.  Can we get up some water?  Hold my hand, man.  Do you want some water?  I'll get a space on.  You want to try and turn on your side?  I broke that fuckin' thing.  I broke it.  I broke my leg, man.  I broke my leg. 
[01:58:30]  You know what the best part is?  That someone thinks ice is going to take care of this.  I know.  Get some ice.  Get some ice.  Fuck it.  I just don't know why I keep whispering like I'm trying to fuck one of the guys there.  I broke my leg, man.  Well, let's go back.  You're kidding.  Where?  My leg.  How did it happen?  I was playing football.  Where?  On my knee.  Oh, God love him.  Give my condolences to the faggot.  That was all of me. 
[01:59:00]  And then Razor's being cold.  He says, don't worry.  You have nothing to be ashamed of.  Then he wrote, not you.  Oh, Jesus.  Someone is saying that they could actually hear Bob's knee pop in this audio.  Really?  Tom in Tennessee.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey, you've got to replay that because I swear to God you could hear his knee snap right  before we started screaming like a little bitch.  Thanks.  Like a little bitch. 
[01:59:30]  Like a little bitch.  You're in all that pain and someone's just making light of it like you're a bitch.  We heard it snap before this bitch started screaming.  Let's go back to the tape.  I backed it up just a little bit, Anthony.  Like a Supruta film.  Just leak.  Maybe just want to play.  Can you get him some water?  Oh, my hand, man.  Do you want some water?  I got to squeeze some.  Or like the Robert Reed film.  You want to try to turn on your side?  I broke that fucking thing.  I broke it.  You're going to be fine, dude.  I broke my leg, man.  Shit.  I broke my leg, man.  Why does it hurt? 
[02:00:00]  Hey.  Yeah.  Do you have the address in the phone?  You can replace it.  Uh, no.  Let me go grab it.  Does it hurt on the outside?  Ah.  Ah.  What?  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Fuck.  What happened?  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Is that Voss's new car?  Ah. 
[02:00:30]  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  That wasn't me.  That was mini-me was there.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Why were you doing that?  Did the farmer start to shear off all your wool?  Ah.  Ah.  Get scared.  Ah.  And the camera guy is just right in your face, right?  He did not stop rolling.  Did not stop rolling.  And the sound guy.  There was a boom guy there, too.  You'd think they would have dropped their equipment to maybe help you out.  You know Dane wouldn't let him.  That's probably why I let go of my hand.  The camera guy was going to put the camera down. 
[02:01:00]  He slapped him in the face.  Stop whining.  Stop it.  Stop whining.  Exactly.  We've got more audio, Anthony, of Bob Kelly playing football.  Oh, Lord.  That's great.  Oh, shit. 
[02:01:30]  What the hell were you thinking?  Exactly.  Playing football.  Even though it's touch.  I mean, Jesus.  It was supposed to be touch football, right?  Yeah, but this friggin' six-foot-three Dominic kid.  Animal was all over you.  He just would jump up and stick his legs out and grab around you and push you.  I just had told him to play before.  Dude, you've got to relax.  Really?  Let's touch football.  Someone's going to get hurt.  I go, dude, someone's going to get hurt.  And he was like, okay, okay, puppy.  Did you hear him in the background?  Anthony, I got more audio of Bob Kelly playing football. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, well.  Not really playing at this point.  I don't know why that did that.  Now this ain't going to make sense.  What?  No, that's not it either.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, stop, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I can't breathe.  Stop.  It's actually this one.  this is a guy

[02:13:00]  They got a smile.  No, I'm going to drool.  They pulled the plug on that.  Jesus, what a mess.  Thank God they pulled the plug.  I sound like an old Kawasaki.  One of the minibikes.  A couple of whales communicating. 
[02:13:30]  Let's go back to the tape here.  Oh, a chair.  It has to be higher than that.  Want a chair?  No, we need to elevate the knee about the heart.  Do you want some hand to?  Can you see?  Where's her?  I don't know.  It's on the side.  It's on the outside.  It's going to hurt him. 
[02:14:00]  Wait, wait.  Danny's getting a chair.  Oh, God.  Hey, you guys.  Hey, man.  You're going to lift your leg.  Oh, my God.  You're going to elevate that leg, Bobby.  Yeah, right there, right there.  There we go.  More, more, more.  Put it right here.  Down here.  There you go.  There you go.  There you go.  There you go.  You're fucking there. 
[02:14:30]  Fuck.  You've got to be shit moving in.  God, that fucking hurts.  Yep.  She came down with the ball.  That's all that matters.  A little joke.  Do you want a pillow?  Do you want to raise your head, Bobby?  Put this under your head, bro?  Maybe you should keep his neck straight.  No, no, no.  Keep the head straight.  Yeah, no.  Keep the head straight.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  God.  Just try not to move around too much, bro.  No.  Look.  I think you're supposed to wait on that. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah, maybe we should wait, because they might want to give him something else.  They gave me cello breaks when that happened to me.  What?  Did you have your knee?  Yeah.  Well, that's what they did, and then the swelling went away.  And the swelling just in a couple of days.  We're probably going to have to mobilize the knee.  That's the main thing.  Stereotherapy.  And that's how it ends. 
[02:15:30]  That's it.  Wow.  Yeah, we're going to get the audio up on foundrymusic.com and opiananthony.com so the listeners can have some fun with that audio.  That does seem painful.  Oh, yeah.  I got to say.  You can't downplay that.  I really am a figure.  I really don't know how to take pain too well.  The old pain threshold a little low on you?  You know, we're comics, though.  It's not like we're out there playing football every Sunday on a league. 
[02:16:00]  Right.  You know, pretty much we walk upstairs and hold the microphone.  Yeah.  You know, our hands have no...  More emotional pain you guys are using.  No fingers, no calluses.  You guys can take a lot of emotional pain.  It's the physical pain you guys really can't take much of.  Well, I can take...  I just...  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  I guess that's it.  Like when Jerry Seinfeld says, not you, you feel hurt, but you're not going, ah.  Right.  I don't know.  I wasn't there.  Perhaps when Jerry went, not you, you went, ah.  Jerry, hold my hand.  Hold my dignity.  Hold my...  He started to touch me. 
[02:16:30]  He started to grab me.  I told him to stop.  He didn't stop.  I hit him back.  And then he got really angry.  He pushed me out of the car.  What do you want, fucko?  You want something?  Huh?  What are you doing?  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, no. 
[02:17:00]  Ah!  Fuck!  I broke my knee, man!  Fuck!  I swear to my fucking mother, if you touch her again, you're dead!  Oh, my hand, man.  I gotta squeeze something.  Ah!  Fuck!  It's the worst of Obie and Anthony with Bob Kelly.  It's the worst of Robbie.  Who is it?  I don't even fucking know.  Why can't I just wing this?  Hey, what's up?  It's me puking.  Which, the only funny part about this to me is,  Anthony's laugh, his fucking extreme cackle when I puke. 
[02:17:30]  I don't know why it makes me laugh, but they make me watch a shit video, and I puke.  Which, you know, people give me crap for, like, oh, why do you puke?  I don't know, it's shit.  Maybe I have a normal fucking stomach.  It's not like they're showing me fucking ice cream or fucking daisies or little kids with dolphins.  They're showing me somebody's asshole and shit coming out of it.  I have the actual, the actual natural response to what that should fucking cause. 
[02:18:00]  Anyways.  Enjoy this.  I'm puking.  It's an asshole.  Then we talk about different types of assholes that I don't like.  I don't like the, um, uh, the asshole with a different colored skin.  You know?  Where, like, the skin is white on the ass and then in the ass.  Yeah, the, but it's not a brown dark.  It's, like, a gray dark.  It's almost purple.  Yeah, it's, like, a purple.  It's, like, almost like it has a rainbow effect to it.  Like, like, opal when the sun hits it, it changes colors. 
[02:18:30]  Like, those cool colors.  You know what I mean?  Those are the assholes I don't like.  I like a nice, I like a nice regular asshole.  And I don't like assholes that are really too pink inside.  It looks like a pussy.  Like, when you open it up, it's, like, pink and beaten up.  Like, somebody's been fucking biting it.  On the inside.  Anyways.  Uh, so enjoy.  Broadcasting the worst of O.B. and Anthony with Bob Kelly.  Jimmy, I'm back on the Metamucil there.  Oh, me too. 
[02:19:00]  Three days in a row.  And, uh, I got the unflavored version.  Have you tried that shit?  Orange only.  It's god-awful.  I started, uh, gagging.  I think the psyllium husk I got, too.  They have orange and regular.  I tried the regular.  Gotta go orange.  You gotta.  The orange is a lovely flavor.  What are you guys taking?  You can't shit regularly?  No, but it just makes you clean out good.  Dude.  The Metamucil makes you shit good.  I literally shit every morning.  As soon as I take a sip of anything, it comes right out.  Dude, well, let me tell you what kind of shits I'm having now because of the Metamucil.  Yeah?  They come out like kind of like-  By the way, you don't know what a can of worms you up in my mentioning shit. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, boy.  You don't know.  Here we go.  Oh, no.  He's the Einstein of logs.  So my shit comes out about that in diameter.  Yeah.  Okay?  Really?  How big is your asshole?  That's not bad.  I'm squeezing it out.  Your fucking asshole will expand a little bit for you.  That's not a big fucking diameter.  A little bit.  Don't make me look like I got a gaping asshole.  That's a massive asshole.  Not like the gaping guy with the four dildos in his ass.  He just sits on the toilet and the log just plummets into the bowl.  From his stomach.  It's right out. 
[02:20:00]  Sit, gloop, stand.  No push.  This is the beauty of the Metamucil dumps, by the way.  So it's about that diameter as it's coming out because I have studied this.  About a silver dollar?  It's basically a baseball bat.  Not a silver dollar, you insane-  Here, look at that, Bobby.  Not as big as this.  Look, Bobby.  Look at that.  Bobby, look.  Look, look, look, look, look.  Bobby, please look right here.  Quick, before it goes by, right there.  Bobby.  Bobby, look. 
[02:20:30]  All right, now we've got to start the tape over.  You know the rules.  Bobby, you've got to look.  Bobby, please look.  Bobby's sticking dildos in his ass.  It's part of the story.  Now look again.  Just watch.  Watch.  Watch the whole thing.  Bobby, keep looking.  Bobby.  Watch this part.  Bobby, watch this part.  This part.  Please.  No, right there.  Oh, God.  That's what I want him to say.  Yeah, can you freeze frame that one part?  I can't.  I don't know.  Bobby, we have to start the tape over now.  Please look.  Bobby, please look. 
[02:21:00]  How can you?  Why wouldn't you?  Bobby, there's one part we want you to see.  That's easy.  You can do that.  That's easy.  Easy, easy.  No problem.  Come on.  Bobby.  Bobby.  Come on.  Now we've got to start it over again.  Come on, Bobby.  We don't want to do this all day.  We freeze frame the part we want you to see.  Quick look.  To the right.  It's not that bad, actually.  For the fans.  Why would you look at this?  To the right.  To the right.  Oh, God.  Holy shit.  That is bad. 
[02:21:30]  Are you okay?  Now you lost 17 pounds.  What was that?  His asshole?  Yeah.  He's right there.  That's actually a different shot.  Bobby, look.  A different shot.  I can't look.  Bobby, please.  Bobby, it's not as graphic.  It just shows you.  Hey, you made fun of my asshole.  I'm getting your back.  Now look at this gaping asshole.  That's a big asshole.  Look at it.  Shut up, Bobby.  Oh, God.  Take a look.  It's not bad.  Shut up.  Look, it's not bad. 
[02:22:00]  Look.  I can't look at it.  Please, Bobby, for me.  It's all over on every fucking street.  Are there other fish?  That one right there.  No, behind.  There, back.  All right.  Bobby, I'm in the middle of my shit story.  How am I supposed to jerk off when you run out like that?  Bobby, sit down, please.  Jesus Christ, dude.  So anyway, so because of the Metamucil, like this, Bobby. 
[02:22:30]  Because I looked.  What's wrong, Bobby?  Bobby, what's wrong now?  All right, Bobby.  You all right there, Bob?  This guy's a fucking...  Bobby, if you're going to puke, do it on mic.  You know the rules.  Oh, God.  Jim.  And Jimmy farted on top.  Who's this?  Well, it's a Metamucil house. 
[02:23:00]  All right, I'm going to do this break for Jimmy.  This is fucking disgusting.  I'm going to do it.  It's so fucking disgusting.  I'm looking at this bloody asshole.  And then he's going to add smell.  He's going to add another sense to this fucking hole.  Smell-O-Vision.  Listen to me.  So the Metamucil, so they come out like this, Bobby, because I took a peek as they were  getting ready to drop.  And the beauty of Metamucil, as soon as it hits the water, they're like snakes in a can.  They get like...  They go like this, and blow up in the water, and get very, very large. 
[02:23:30]  I need some Gatorade.  Why Gatorade?  You lose that many electrolytes for life.  Replaces electrolytes.  You're not in the Olympics.  Bob has electro-heavies.  Bobby, now down to 17.  Congratulations.  I hope we're fucking...  All right, we'll take a break so I can eat just...  Did you get a whiff of that fart?  Yeah, it's the worst.  Really bad.  Your asshole stinks. 
[02:24:00]  Can we take a break so I can eat my...  Your asshole smells like his asshole looks.  Did you see the one?  You missed a couple.  Put that back on.  No, I'm not watching it.  Why did I...  Don't fuck yourself.  How do you have so weak stomach?  Like, I couldn't smell it.  Yeah.  But look at it on the picture as a model.  Watch what I think.  I don't like assholes.  Put it back.  Watch what I do.  This is what a man does.  That's right.  I'll jerk off on him.  Watch what I do.  Add ketchup to that sandwich.  We'll see if you fucking eat it.  Watch what I do.  Egg sandwich.  Put some ketchup on it.  There you go.  Look.  Watching the video.  The one asshole is...  I don't get why it's...  This is good film, man. 
[02:24:30]  We're from Big Bill.  Oh, God.  He's got...  Two giant ones.  We're eating a sandwich and Jimmy's jerking his cock.  It's the one shot you got to see.  It's not a red one.  All right, Jim.  I get it.  I already looked at it.  I'm done.  He's sitting on a fire hydrant.  Look at that.  Go fuck yourself.  Go to break.  Both of you.  Go fuck yourself.  What is that?  I fucking hate that.  It's funny that you guys giggle about this shit.  It's a man holding his fucking giant elephant asshole open.  And you guys can't stop giggling. 
[02:25:00]  I know.  There's something not wrong here.  What is wrong with us?  No, it's me.  No, it's me.  I'm fucked up because I puke at that shit.  It's not you fucking three giggling cuts laughing at it.  You make a point.  You make a point.  You make a fucking fucking smoothies.  Yeah, before I'm back.  What a tea party you guys have.  Look at how great that is.  I can't eat fucking raspberry pie right now looking at that.  It wouldn't bother me.  Yeah.  Nothing bothers me.  Well, I don't smell it.  Smell it would gross me.  That guy's a big dick, too.  Oh, Jesus.  What are you looking at his cock for?  Just to fuck every frame.  Well, you're not a fucking...  It's not exactly where it's Waldo. 
[02:25:30]  You're not fucking CSI in a crime scene, you faggot.  His cock was huge.  He seems to be enjoying himself.  Well, he's having the fucking time of his life.  He's having a proverbial blast.  I told you.  I found a bag of dildos when I used to work with the retards.  Did you smell them?  Yeah, sometimes.  The dildo.  I mean, you brush your nose against them?  Well, the guy that did...  I did a shift at another house on weekends.  I would do the overnight shift.  So the guy that lived there could actually go and do shit. 
[02:26:00]  And he always used to keep the remote in his room.  He'd take the TV remote and bring it back into his room.  So I had a couple of my friends over, you know, from Boston.  A couple of fucking total Boston fucking Bobby Command.  Tough guys.  We're over there watching TV.  The retards are asleep.  And I go into the room to find the remote because it's not in the TV room.  There's a bag, a duffel bag of fucking dildos.  Just open.  He had a Tupperware thing of lard. 
[02:26:30]  Okay?  I bring these fucking bag out to the room.  Tupperware thing of lard.  And a fucking dildo collection the size of baseball bats.  One was like a fucking huge fist with the fingers curled up at the end.  Oh.  He had a double fucking side of dildo.  And then he just had...  It didn't even have like the shape of a cock.  It was just a fucking huge bat.  Like just like this big.  Just wanted a bat up his ass.  Just like a bat.  Like a rubber fucking bat.  That long, this big. 
[02:27:00]  And he had a Tupperware thing full of lard.  And there was like finger scoops.  Like we opened it.  There was like finger scoops out of it.  Like three finger scoops.  How does that guy get his ass down on that butt plug like that?  I just couldn't believe it though.  Danny from Louisiana.  Danny, what's up?  Hey, everybody.  I just wanted to let you know the guys are watching gay porn in the studio.  Linger one day.  There you go.  Very nice.  Yeah. 
[02:27:30]  Can we take a break?  Yeah, let's do that.  I hate that fucking...  Bobby, look at that one.  No way.  That's not even that bad.  It's a cone going on.  No, I don't like when the fucking...  The inner workings of an asshole.  I don't like when the...  I don't even like when you're seeing a chick getting fucked in the asshole and her skin,  the inside of her asshole, comes back up.  A pink sock?  You don't like a pink sock?  No, no, no.  What are you fucking...  Who'd you vote for?  A fucking Gorbachev?  Communist?  I don't like it.  I don't fucking like a pink sock.  That's not a pink sock.  It's just a guy's ass. 
[02:28:00]  He's not even opening it.  Yeah, it's a guy's asshole turned inside out.  I don't even like when the fucking pussy does that.  Just leave it there.  That's not bad.  That's actually a weird one.  Look at this.  I got you up.  But look at him.  No, you're out of your mind.  Oh, wow.  Derek said it looks like Hal from 2001.  It's Dante's inferno.  Oh, Hal?  I think he's in hell.  It's not that bad.  He can see it under the monitor.  Overhead view of Mount St. Helens before it blew.  Fuck, I was right there with you.  Oh, God.  I can't look.  Bolton lava. 
[02:28:30]  That is fucking hilarious.  Bolton lava.  You can see the hot magma.  How could you not laugh at that?  It's fucking hilarious.  I don't know, faggot.  No, but I don't hear a lot.  Oh, God.  I don't know.  There's something definitely wrong with me.  I don't want to look at it.  So you're just trying to shit out one of those little spares that come with your car?  Oh, and that's just fucking ridiculous.  That's disgusting.  It's like he just shoved raw chopped meat on his head.  But he's actually the thing that makes the chopped meat as it's coming out. 
[02:29:00]  The grinder.  The grinder.  Oh, that's a lot of shits.  The whole sandwich just comes out the way it went in.  Or not.  Time for break, huh?  Time for...  Oh, God.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Bob Kelly is hosting the worst of Opie and Anthony.  This is another great...  Actually, this show is probably worse for my career doing this show.  This is the only radio show I've ever done that probably gets less people to my shows.  Honest to God.  Just fucking...  I...  I... 
[02:29:30]  You know.  You let fucking some hack fucking famous comic come in and sell out his fucking room  by making him look like a fucking genius.  And then I come in.  A good friend of him.  Everybody here.  It's just fucking...  You know what?  I need to...  I need to go to a mom and pop.  Is there like a big radio show that's nice to comics?  Hey, get ready for this.  This is me having a crush on that fucking homo Sam.  That little twink bitch who looks like he comes from a Dr. Seuss book. 
[02:30:00]  How can you not be?  How can you not be attracted to him?  This little sarcastic, cute little smile.  Anyways, I talked about that.  And then theories that fucking kids walk down the beach naked.  No one cares but if a guy has pubes.  I think that's true, though.  If you have pubes, why does pubes make it dirty?  I would have said a new pubes, too.  Yeah, pubes make it dirty for some reason.  Oh, yeah.  Especially a couple.  Like, they're just coming in.  That's when it's really weird.  You know, there's like four or five and one's real long, but the rest are little fucking  small ones. 
[02:30:30]  Anyways.  All right.  So enjoy this one.  Broadcasting the worst of O.B. and Anthony with Bob Kelly.  My heart right now is really, honest to God, palpitating.  Really?  I have a cold sweat right now.  I'm not even joking with you.  My heart feels like it aches.  Man, these places are dangerous.  Yeah, it feels like somebody punched my heart.  Like, put my heart out, punched it, and then put it back in.  A nice piece of plaque comes out right now.  Oh, God.  You guys would just let me lie there until you move over to XM. 
[02:31:00]  The Tim Russert special.  That brings up an interesting question.  Let's say you needed mouth-to-mouth.  Is there a person in the studio that would do that for Bob Kelly?  Sam would run in here as quick as it would happen and put his little lion cub mouth right  on my lips.  I forgot you have a crush on Sam.  Lion cub mouth?  I forgot that Bobby has a real-life crush on Sam.  Actually, I think I'm moving over to his brother now, because Sam has chest hair. 
[02:31:30]  That bugs me.  That makes it gay.  I'm not gay.  Of course not.  No.  Not the way you talk about attractive Brazilian men bringing you meat.  Yeah, but Sam, like, he has chest hair, I heard.  Young Sam.  And that's gay.  I don't want to...  Bob, you kissed me on the lips.  Yeah, but you kissed...  You didn't pull back.  And he's got whiskers.  No, he doesn't.  Yeah, he does.  Look, he's got a full...  You can grow a full beard, right?  I'm 24 years old.  Yes.  Can I see... 
[02:32:00]  He's got to say I'm 24 years old.  He's got one of those bumpy beards.  He's got a few of those, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  What, razor bumps?  Yeah, it's called wrapper neck.  What is your chest?  Do you get a lot of hair?  No.  No.  Let me see.  No, it's none of your business, actually.  Let me just see.  Why?  I just...  Just pull up your shirt for him.  I want to see.  I'll turn away.  Let me just see.  Just for Bobby.  Go ahead.  The mic is in the middle of your chest.  Go over there. 
[02:32:30]  There you go.  See...  You can see from here.  I don't...  What's wrong with his chest?  See that little patch of hair?  This is for pal talk.  See that little patch of hair?  Ew.  Bobby.  He's around his nipples, too, which makes it...  He makes him manly.  He's not boy-like anymore.  Can I put my shirt down?  Yeah, you...  You gotta throw him back now, right, Bobby?  Yeah, he's no good.  He's a...  He's no good anymore.  He's damaged goods now?  He's no good.  He's got that little patch above his belly button, which...  You're one of those guys that, like, would abuse a child and then have to face them when 
[02:33:00]  they get older and have hair and be like, hey, how you doing?  I don't know what it is, though.  Pubes really do make a guy dirty.  What?  What are you talking about?  Say you're at the beach and you saw a little kid running down the beach, a little boy naked,  and he's got nothing.  No pubes.  And then all of a sudden, you see, like, that kid...  You can't just let...  If you have pubes, it's dirty.  If you have no pubes, it's kind of like, hey, look at that little thing.  Look at him justifying. 
[02:33:30]  All right, listen.  Holy mother of God.  I don't really...  Pubes are the...  Pubes are what you can't...  I don't really feel like saying goodbye to a 25-year broadcasting career because of  your sick mind, Bob.  I'm not saying that I like...  What are you talking about?  That's pedophilia crap.  I don't know what that means.  That means get the F out of the studio.  Your time is done.  I do believe what he's saying is that a lot of times parents will let their children  run down the beach disrobed.  Right, and it's not bad.  And it's acceptable like that. 
[02:34:00]  But the second you show any type of maturity happening where it's hair or anything like  that, that it becomes dirty and you must cover it up.  Thank you, Anthony, for explaining it and saving me from whatever that movement he did.  This comes from experience, then.  You see parents with kids that might be too old to still be naked.  Think about that, though.  You see kids at the beach and it's like they're running around naked and it's not a real big  deal.  Nobody's saying anything. 
[02:34:30]  It's just, okay, whatever.  It's a little kid.  But as soon as he gets a couple whiskers, it's like, ah, put that away.  I always thought it was kind of like creepy to see kids naked.  Always.  Yeah, always.  Always.  I think it's...  I mean, I got a lot of nephews and nieces and every once in a while one's running around  naked and I always found it kind of creepy, to be honest with you.  Even though they're still very young and all that.  Yeah.  And it's just that it's an innocent baby naked thing.  But it's still like it's a little weird to me.  I wouldn't even take pictures at Christmas with my little cousins on my lap. 
[02:35:00]  Because I'm in like pajama bottoms and they're on my lap and I just get away.  No, no pictures with me.  Just sit on the floor.  I'll tap the top of your head.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Rob Kelly is hosting the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Hey, it's the worst of Opie and Anthony hosted by me, Robert Kelly.  We have more of this stupid shit coming up right after the break.  So, don't change that dial. 
[02:35:30]  All right.  This next bit is when I was in rehab.  You couldn't fraternize.  I was in there for a year.  Rehab.  And it was all males.  It was a nine-year-old to 18-year-old.  And you couldn't fraternize with women.  So all we did was masturbate.  And we all had bunk beds.  So I never really liked to jerk off with other people around.  So I used to sneak out in group and go to the bathroom on the second floor where it had a really long countertop sink. 
[02:36:00]  And the sink was right in the middle of it.  So you could lie on it.  And you could place your hand in a certain way.  And put cream in your hand.  And fuck it.  Like a human.  You put your hand inside of the sink.  Brace it on the edge.  And then push the tip in.  And it feels just like a vagina.  Because it's like, ow, it hurts. 
[02:36:30]  Ow, ow.  And then this warm cake.  Actually, once it hits the cream inside the fist.  It's like, ooh.  And then it slides in and out.  And then when you dump your hot, steamy child salad, it goes right into the sink.  And you don't have to really clean up anything.  It's right there in like a little bowl.  You get some toilet paper, wipe it up, throw it in the toilet, flush.  No evidence.  And I got caught.  Fuck in the sink.  By eight other fucking group members.  Because there was a crack in the door. 
[02:37:00]  So there you go.  Enjoy.  Broadcasting the worst of Obi and Anthony with Bob Kelly.  Mark from Virginia.  What's up?  Hey, man.  I got to defend little Jimmy.  What's that, fella?  Hey, I got to defend little Jimmy, man.  You're the man.  Without you, man, that wouldn't be a great show.  Oh, and hey, you got a great show, man.  But you got to keep little Jimmy in there.  Thank you.  We're keeping little Jimmy.  Well, Jimmy's not going anywhere.  I don't want to get fired.  We just want him to fart less.  That's all.  Hey, man. 
[02:37:30]  He's got to relieve some pressure from somehow.  He can't just whip out his mule and do it right there in the show.  Thank you, sir.  That's exactly what.  And I get very excited sometimes.  It just sneaks out.  I don't mean to ruin the show.  There you go, man.  He pops.  You're my idol, little Jimmy.  Thank you, buddy.  He pops boners all the time.  So what?  It's all those are good things.  Dude, but you have to show everyone.  Help it.  He gets our attention and grabs onto it.  We're trying to enjoy the freaking 20-year-old stripper from L.A.  And all of a sudden, we're all like, what?  What has he got?  And then we're looking at your hog again. 
[02:38:00]  You don't have to look.  Well, when you're jumping up and down like you might have something.  I don't jump.  I just kind of point and you guys choose to look.  I don't jump.  He definitely tries to get your attention.  He lifts it over the edge of the console, grabs, pulls it sideways, and shakes it a little.  Yeah.  I want a little extension built around his area.  A mule hider?  Yes.  Like a sneeze guard for a mule guard?  It's perfect height where he can just plop it on the table.  It does. 
[02:38:30]  He lays it on there.  I do rub it against this thing.  It's perfect.  I'll have some of the Norton wiener.  You can't out gay Norton, though.  No, it's not a gay thing when I do that.  I'm usually turned out by a woman.  It's not like I'm just...  You can't.  If you try to...  He'll try to hug me or something.  I understand what Bob Kelly's saying, though.  Yeah.  You know, out gay.  I mean, you like to try to get that reaction by doing something that would be perceived as gay.  No, I don't.  One time I actually...  You know, he does gay things once in a while and it freaks you out.  And one time I was like, you know what?  I'm going to out gay him.  And I actually...  You can't out gay him.  I stuck my finger right near his butt and he actually stopped and backed up and my finger went in his asshole. 
[02:39:00]  And I just...  How many knuckles did he get in there?  It was one and a half.  Yeah.  It was like a little shrimp.  I could actually bend my finger.  That did not happen.  I just...  He just stopped and tried to put...  And then he went like this.  Ooh.  He tried to put his finger by my ass and it's like, look, you're going to learn a lesson the hard way.  Why is your pants down at this point?  No, no, no.  My pants were on.  Easy, easy, Opie.  Why did you get a finger up?  We were just walking in the hallway of the apartment.  We were dressed.  How many knuckles you took? 
[02:39:30]  You took a knuckle and a half through the jeans?  I would actually take something real, enhance it, exaggerate it.  Therein lies the ha-ha.  Yeah, he didn't mean to put my ass.  I didn't mean I stuck my finger in his ass.  That would be gay, wouldn't it?  He put it against my ass and I just backed up against it to teach him who was boss.  He learned how to do it.  Well, you should have told me it was exaggerated humor.  We don't know.  I thought that's what humor was.  Not all the time.  Really?  What's the other type of humor?  Dude, we've all seen him naked, so it was quite possible that that actually happened.  I've seen him naked.  Don't look at me like I'm an alien.  That's an exaggeration, too.  I've never seen Jimmy naked. 
[02:40:00]  There you go.  All right, show him your hug.  I don't want to.  No, I will show him my hug.  I don't want to see Jimmy naked.  I love the face he gets when he gets ... I was actually with him one time, and he gets  this face.  His eyes just open wide, and his head turns down, and his upper lip goes underneath his back  teeth, and he just looks like a little troll, and he just doesn't blink, like Christopher  Walken in a scene, and he just stares at the girl like, yeah.  Yeah, it is nasty.  Oh, he does.  It's just evil.  He is.  His little body.  Did you ever have a Monster Rain story? 
[02:40:30]  Did you come up with one yet?  No.  You heard my story, right?  No.  What was yours?  Oh, you weren't listening the other day.  He had the marshmallow in the frat house.  Which people are saying is just as bad as the Monster Rain.  Of course it is.  I was out in Arizona last week.  I missed the whole show.  It's one of those things where you're hazing for a fraternity, and one of the things he  ought to do is pull the pants down, pick up a marshmallow with his ass, and drop it  on a little mock fraternity frat house.  And then no one ate it? 
[02:41:00]  No.  No, you sick ass.  Come on.  That's it?  But it's a room full of guys with their pants down.  It's a room full of guys with their pants down, picking up things with their buttholes.  Look who says that, the guy that put a finger in my ass.  Well, he didn't.  Well, I guess Mike Cracky did.  No, you had your pants on.  Yeah, but I felt the actual shrimp haul, the actual...  Separation.  Yeah, the separation.  I'm guessing there's a Bob Kelly story.  That bombs you?  I thought it was a little odd that frats do things like that and have guys in these 
[02:41:30]  nude circumstances doing things.  Yeah, I think it's a little...  There's definitely a Bob Kelly story.  Yeah, there's definitely a Bob Kelly story.  Now, let me just get this straight.  Is it like just pure molestation?  Does it have to be a guy or can it be a girl or an aunt?  No, we all have girl stories.  How old would the boy be and how old would the aunt be?  Oh, jeez.  What the hell is an aunt?  I don't like it either.  I'm just going for the story.  I'm from aunt.  It's an aunt.  Aunt.  What do you say, aunt?  Yeah, we say aunt.  If I say aunt, then he's going to go what?  And then it's going to be like a whole back and forth. 
[02:42:00]  Who's on first?  Aunt.  Aunt.  Oh, marshmallios.  Listen.  My aunt, aunt.  What?  What?  Aunt.  I've done a couple things.  I guess we were talking about things that could be bad.  Yeah, you got to do the gay one.  Looked at as, yeah.  A little gay.  A little gay.  A little gay.  Well, I used to...  I got shards of glass in my hand.  You broke a CD and it just made shards.  You all right?  Yeah, I'll be all right.  That's what you get.  All right, relax. 
[02:42:30]  Easy.  Yeah, I should settle down, huh?  Settle down.  Now, what do you got down?  Why don't you settle down?  Find a girl like Henry.  Tell us your gay story.  What?  It's not gay.  Only the good half.  It's not gay because it was young.  Settle down every night, ma?  It was young.  You were young.  Yeah, well, that's the whole Monster Ain excuse Jimmy gives is it's not gay because he was young.  Well, it's true.  Everybody, four out of five young boys have done stuff with their buddies' pee-pees when they're young  because you don't know what sex is yet.  And the fifth one watches.  That's what my therapist told me. 
[02:43:00]  Really?  Yeah, that it's pretty natural.  Really?  So when you were, how old were you and whatever?  So I guess I'm not normal.  Oh, yeah, you are.  You're so normal, you probably repressed it.  But there's a normal memory there.  I honestly couldn't give you one, though.  It's going to come out someday.  I forgot all about the marshmallow story, so I guess we'll see.  I'm sure there's more in there.  All right, go ahead.  How old were you?  How old was I?  I think I was, I had to be in first grade.  First grade.  First grade.  That's six?  Actually, yeah.  It was before first grade.  My first sexual experience with a woman was in first grade with this chick, the Blouse. 
[02:43:30]  This local whore.  And she made me suck.  Whore?  Yeah, the Blouse.  How old was she?  She was like, she had to be like 14.  Oh.  So she was older, and she took me in the bushes and made me suck on her tits, and then she  played with my little mushroom, like she just played with it.  Wow.  And I went home now.  What a little whore.  I actually cried all night because I thought God was going to punish me.  And he was going to.  And he did.  What a good Catholic. 
[02:44:00]  I remember me and my...  You cried all night because of that?  Well, you know, I was raised Catholic.  That's horrendous.  Of course.  And I didn't know she's touching me, and I'm sucking on...  She made me do this stuff.  I was molested.  You were molested.  And then I went home that night, and I was just crying in my bed, just crying, praying  for God.  Please forgive me.  I'm sorry.  This is bad.  Are you kidding?  My mother actually came up.  She was like, honey, what's wrong?  I was like, nothing.  I'm just...  You know, I had a bad dream, and I just cried all night.  I just felt bad. 
[02:44:30]  Thank you, man.  Sorry.  I just had to make this story a little more fun.  Yeah.  Corn, corn, corn.  All right, so you're crying in bed.  Let dirty boy finish his story.  Well, you know, what's funny is like a week later, I actually...  You do understand it was your fault.  It was my fault?  Yeah.  Why?  It was your fault.  She took me into the bush and made me...  Looking all sexy.  What are you expecting to parade that little hairless jewel around?  Who wouldn't touch it, for Pete's sake?  She used to take me into Tufts University, and after that, I kind of got into it, and 
[02:45:00]  I used to grab my friend, Matthew.  We used to go up into the attic of Tufts University, and just each one of us would...  She was fat, just fat and huge tits, and each one of us would just suck on a tit.  Wow.  Like little babies.  Like little...  They were little babies.  Yeah.  It was just this hot, sweaty attic, and this fat chick, and she was just sweating, and  me and him would just both grab one of our huge tits and just suck on a flack.  And was she getting pleasure out of this?  Was she moaning or something?  No, not really. 
[02:45:30]  She would just sit there.  Sometimes she'd smoke during it.  I swear to God, she'd just light up a cigarette.  It was weird.  Like, she would just do it with everybody.  My first three chicks were just fat, white chicks.  The Blouse, Kimba, and some other chick.  I don't remember.  Kimba, yeah.  She would just...  Where's the guy thing come in?  Oh, when I was before...  No, you know when it was after that.  You're trying to tell chick stories, and you're like, where's the guy stuff?  I kind of like the Blouse story.  Yeah, thanks, Anthony.  That was nice.  I mean, Ope.  Sorry.  Nice talking to you.  I wanted to, you know, keep you on track. 
[02:46:00]  All right.  Well, you know what happened is that me and my friend, we would go over to...  He would come over to my house, because both of my parents worked, and my sister would  be out, so we'd just lie on the couch.  Uh-oh.  That's already sound right.  Oh, boy.  Buckle up.  Buckle up.  Here comes another monster rain.  This is way beyond monster rain.  I can sense it.  I don't know why you call it monster rain.  Why don't you just call it sucking each other's cocks and being friends?  Well, the more I look at it, the more I realize that there probably was no such thing as monster 
[02:46:30]  rain.  I've come to that conclusion.  Oh, really?  You're backing out of stuff now?  What are you saying?  No.  I didn't know that you guys grew up together.  No, easy.  What I was saying was...  If me and him were buddies when we were a kid, we'd have some...  Dude, remember that time I banged you in your ass?  All right.  All right.  Listen.  We wouldn't have a story like that.  That wasn't gay.  I talked to my therapist.  That's not gay.  We just didn't know any better.  We're friends, you know?  Didn't know.  All right.  So you and your friend would lie on the couch.  We would lie on the couch just before I...  How old was he?  13.  How old were you?  No, I'm joking.  He was...  Ah, shit.  We had to be... 
[02:47:00]  We had to be...  How old are you in fifth grade?  How old are you in fifth grade?  11.  I don't know.  It depends what color you are.  No, not 11.  11?  No, it wasn't 11.  What color are you?  You were 11 years old.  Hang on.  I didn't even hear that.  That's so bad.  That's good.  You were 11.  I wasn't...  Opie, it's not 11, because I was in...  You graduate sixth grade, you're 12 years old.  Right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So you're 11 in fifth grade.  It must have been...  You were 11.  Fourth grade.  11.  I wasn't 11, because I started drinking at 11.  10 or 11. 
[02:47:30]  And I wasn't drinking then.  Of course you started drinking.  This is my first addiction.  This is my first addiction.  Then I moved on to booze.  So what happened when you were almost a teenager?  You're laying on the couch.  You lie on the couch.  You just lie there.  And this is when...  Remember when you first started jerking off, you used Vaseline?  Yes.  Remember like petroleum jelly?  Sure.  You were like waterproof your dick for like three days.  Yes.  Just jump in the shower to wash it off, and it would just beat up.  Just looking for anything slippery at that age.  Didn't matter.  Run around like a monkey. 
[02:48:00]  Just looking, what?  Pancake batter?  I don't care.  Whatever works.  I jerked off with anything.  Anything.  Anything.  I used to jerk off with the Juergens, and I'd fuck the sink.  You ever fuck the sink?  I can't say I've ever done that.  If you ever want to jerk off, and it feels like you're fucking somebody, you get on...  You know the big, long sinks in the bathroom, the counter?  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  You can't have like a pedestal sink.  How small is your dick?  Listen to me.  It's a sink.  Wait.  It's the way you pull the little thing out that seals your drain up?  No.  You don't fuck the sink sink. 
[02:48:30]  You lie on the counter.  It has to be a counter with the sink in the middle.  Oh, oh.  You lie down, and you put your hand here.  It's almost like a ditch in the...  It's a ditch, and you put your hand on the edge.  You lube up your hand, and you push your hand in, and then your hand is stationary.  And it all goes in the sink.  And you get to fuck, and then it goes right in the sink.  It's unbelievable.  You are a genius.  Oh, it's unbelievable.  It really feels like you're fucking somebody.  I swear to God.  I'm not going to be able to look at a sink ever again.  No.  That is brilliant, because there's no cleanup. 
[02:49:00]  You're getting...  You're able to use your whole body in it.  You open your eyes, and you're looking right at yourself in the mirror.  How fucking creepy is that?  As a fat, bald chick, I'm fucking...  I got caught in rehab.  When I went to rehab, I got caught fucking the sink.  I used to fuck the sink during our group sessions, because I know everybody was in the group.  So one time, I guess, somebody snapped in group, and they had to end group early.  And I'm in the bathroom fucking the sink, and there was like a crack in the door. 
[02:49:30]  Oh, no.  And all of a sudden, I just hear giggling, and all 10 guys from my rehab house were in there.  They were just watching me fuck the sink.  It was just awful.  So you still do that?  I haven't done it, because I have a pedestal sink now.  You can't do that.  Yeah, you can't do that.  I'm too fat to balance myself on a pedestal sink.  But yeah, I've done it.  I've done it in hotel rooms.  You ever go in the hotels?  You have to go in the cheesy hotels, but the suite in a cheesy hotel always has that  big, long counter with one sink, little sink in the middle. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah, perfect.  Just jump up on top.  You lube your hand up.  Don't lube your dick up.  No?  No, because you want to lube just the inside of your hand.  Put it on there.  And then when you push it in, it's like cracking the seal of a real pussy.  What the hell is going on?  You want a little resistance.  You want a little resistance, because it cracks it, and you're like, oh.  And it feels like you're cracking the seal of a stink wrinkle just as it's going in.  Oh, it's unbelievable.  Right now, there's a sink in therapy somewhere.  I just wanted to clean people and help and wash them. 
[02:50:30]  And this fat kid would climb on and put his dinghy in my face.  Well, I was in the bathroom where I usually am, and the light came on.  These are great distractions.  So, what happened with the guy on the camera?  Yeah, it's true.  Fucking the sink.  I've never heard of that.  So, you were almost a teenager, naked with another boy.  And you pretended...  There's no naked.  That wasn't...  Wait a minute, Ovi.  I love...  You are such a fucking magician.  You said fifth grade.  You said almost a teenager.  I know, but throw the teen out.  I'm still a young boy.  You're still young. 
[02:51:00]  You're a master at that, and I know what you're doing.  Dude, fifth grade is...  Because all these...  Fifth grade is 11.  Could be 11 and a half.  That's close to a teenager.  All these truck drivers are hearing it's teenager, boy, man.  There you go.  So, I played Monster Rain, and you played Use My Mouth Like a Sink.  All right, go ahead.  Yeah.  So, let's go.  Well, I would...  We'd just lie on the couch.  Mommy's gone for the day.  Gone for the day, and we'd lie on the couch, and we'd pull each other's pants down, and  then, like, he would jerk off, and I would jerk off with the Vaseline. 
[02:51:30]  But then...  Oh, God.  But then...  Oh, God.  Go ahead.  Are you ready?  Yeah.  But it's not gay, because you're too young to know.  Yeah, you're too young to know what's going on.  Meanwhile, you've got the DVD player working.  Well, your shoulder felt the height.  Let me tell you something.  I've never paid $250 to, you know, repeat this while I was older.  It's never happened.  I, uh...  Nothing.  Good.  Oh, my goodness.  No, we got it.  Nice talking to you.  So, we would jerk off, and after a while, it's like when you're in a pool,  and, you know, you play one game, and it's like, ah, what's... 
[02:52:00]  You start just making up anything.  We're going to, you know, duct tape nander and throw her in the pool, and whoever...  If she drowns, you lose.  If you save her, you win.  I'm bored with Marco Polo, so...  Yeah, exactly.  Marco!  Marco!  Oh!  So...  That was it.  There it is.  So, uh...  Yeah.  So...  You're getting bored.  So, you're getting bored just cranking it with each other.  Yeah, so you get...  Or in front of each other.  Well, you get bored, you're just cranking it out, and you were so young, nothing's coming out.  You're kind of pretending.  You know what I mean? 
[02:52:30]  You ever have...  Oh, okay.  That's going to be the savior right there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's going to pull you out of this.  Yeah, I'm just saying.  This is what annoyed me, is that my friend was older than me, so he could actually blow  a load, and I remember being so self-conscious, and one time I got a marshmallow, and I mushed  it up in my hand, and I put, like, little daubs, so I was like, I came too, because...  Really?  Well, I was just...  I was so...  Oh, man.  Dude, you're now starting to scare me.  What, dude?  I just wanted to...  You're a freak.  I wanted to blow a load. 
[02:53:00]  It's like, you want to be part of the crew.  You didn't get that marshmallow from a frat house, did you?  No?  Actually, it looked like it had been roasted over a fire for five seconds.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Blonde, bang, gorgeous guy actually pulled up and gave me a marshmallow.  Marshmallow.  Get it?  Nice.  Got it.  Oh, so...  You faked it.  No, I didn't fake it.  I think by this time, I could actually...  No, I couldn't.  You put the marshmallow all over here.  All right, listen.  How long were you guys doing this?  Yeah, how many years?  How many years?  Well, he would come over every once in a while, but it got... 
[02:53:30]  Well, it was dumb when he left for college.  He still drops by.  We go to the game.  Can I just say something, though?  You said too much.  I see him every once in a while.  No.  I'm so open with it.  I've talked about it.  I remember when I went to rehab, the guy brought me in.  This guy brought me in.  He goes, tell me the worst thing you've never told anybody.  And I was like, this is the story I told him.  I go, this is what I carry around with me my whole life that makes me feel like a piece  of shit.  And he goes, everybody's done that. 
[02:54:00]  And he goes, I've done it.  And he goes, go get Mark, John, and Billy in here.  And they all come in.  Hey, you ever jerk off with your friend?  You ever touch your friend's cock when you were young?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  See?  He goes, it's not that bad.  Everybody does that.  And I was like, hey.  Then we all went and jerked each other off.  No, I'm joking.  So you got bored with Marco Polo.  Stop.  Going off track here.  Good point, Ope.  Thank you.  Good point.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Keep him on track.  Keep him focused.  And that's why you're here, Ope.  That's why I'm a radio genius.  You are.  What happened now?  Yeah, you're a little bored.  So you get a little bored. 
[02:54:30]  Fuck slow.  And I felt weird, too, because I was definitely the bottom.  Oh, okay.  All right.  What the hell?  You were more of the feminine one in this relationship?  Faking it to keep him happy?  Not feminine.  It was more like...  He was the take charge kind of guy.  Well, I was younger, you know?  Yeah.  I was the younger kid, so I was...  All right.  I was the learner.  He was the teacher.  So what then happened?  So then he would be like, why don't you grab mine and play with mine?  Ah, there you go.  So I would grab it, but I grabbed it like this. 
[02:55:00]  Oh, because doing it upside down doesn't make it gay.  No, because I'm not at all.  You know, so I did it like...  That's the way men jerk off other men.  I was going to do it, but I didn't really want to commit, so I did it this way.  You know what I mean, right, guys?  Some and forefinger against the body.  No, it's not that.  That keeps it away from God.  It's just that I'm dyslexic, so I went on his.  I went upside down.  Yeah, upside down.  No, I just didn't know how to grab another man.  I never grabbed, so I knew how to grab mine, but it was like, how do I grab it?  He's like, no, do it this way. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah, I guess you would grab it the same way, right?  You know what's so funny, too, is that he had a retarded baby brother, and his brother  came in.  Oh, no.  And he...  Oh, what a mess that must have been.  No, no, no.  He didn't come in while we were doing this.  He came in...  Damn it.  Jesus, Jim.  You know after this session, you're going to leave us a check, right?  A check for what?  The therapy.  Getting this off your chest.  Getting this off your chest.  Well, he...  He's taking over the whole show.  His little brother came in, and he had a huge, just a retard talk.  Well, we've talked about that.  All retards have huge retard hodges.  And he had pubes, and he was younger than me. 
[02:56:00]  I had no pubes, and I had this...  The internet is for porn.  The internet is for porn.  The internet is for porn.  Thank you, Ed.  Keep it fun, Ed.  Keep it fun.  The internet is for porn.  The internet is for porn.  Hit me up all night, hugging me horns.  Porn, porn, porn.  Yes, Bob.  So, anyways, he actually...  He actually...  He goes, put it in your mouth.  Oh, boy.  Okay.  Wait, wait.  Oh, boy.  The retard dick?  No, not the retard dick.  I couldn't fit that in my mouth.  Oh, we've gotten to that point. 
[02:56:30]  So, anyways, I put it in...  How many chapters?  How many chapters to this story?  And what chapter are we up to?  Oh, no, you didn't.  You didn't.  You must have known that that was much more wrong than just cranking in front of each other.  I swear to God, I didn't.  I was too young.  I didn't know.  No, I know.  So, what happened?  He said, put it in my mouth, and you did.  I put it in, and it tasted like...  It was like just...  It didn't...  It just like feet.  It tasted like feet? 
[02:57:00]  Yeah, like it just tastes...  Did you ever suck your toes when you were a kid?  Like bite your toenails?  No, I didn't.  You never bit your toenails?  I do constantly, but I never compared that to a cock.  Oh, my God.  He's telling us what...  Well, you didn't bite the dickhead, did you?  Like...  No.  I just remember it was like...  It was spongy.  It's like...  Ant's brain is short-surgent.  A spongy foot.  He's talking.  He's telling what it feels like to have another man's dick in his mouth.  It's not a man.  It's a kid.  It doesn't make it any better when I say it's a kid.  You're almost 13. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did he have hair?  I wouldn't let him do it to me, though, because he had braces, and it scared me.  All right.  So at least you were old enough to make the pain association.  Give me old payback.  Well, you know what?  It's not gay, guys.  It's not gay.  It's just...  Listen to me.  No, we believe you.  Guys, look at me in the eye.  Could you hear that?  I can't.  I can't.  Everybody's looking at the wall, and it's making me feel bad.  I can't.  You have...  Yeah, you're on your own.  No, I can't even look at you.  Opie, look at me.  No.  I'm looking for a...  Anthony, look at me.  That's right.  You're a little bitch.  That's right.  You're a bitch, and I bet you'd like to suck it, wouldn't you? 
[02:58:00]  We just want this to go away now.  He is.  I am gay.  Yeah.  Well, I actually...  Can I tell you about the retard story?  Those men wanted to have sex with me.  You have to.  I...  Yeah.  Can I just recover?  This...  I used to have this...  Huh?  What?  She wasn't retarded.  She was like that dumb...  No, we don't want to hear it if there's a shame.  Yeah, that she's...  Yeah, but she was retarded.  You're stupid.  She was retarded, though.  Dada!  Stop laughing at me!  Stop laughing at me! 
[02:58:30]  You stop laughing at me!  I am...  Dada!  Stop laughing at me!  Audio from the Kelly's basement.  She used to follow me home every day, and one day, I actually...  You didn't have sex with a retard.  Well, one day...  There's actually two stories.  I brought her...  She brought me home.  I mean, I brought her home.  She followed me home.  Here's how we...  This is where we get the gay out of the show, Anthony.  Yeah.  Sex with retards, only on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:59:00]  Take a promo out of that.  She used to follow me home.  I think it was seventh grade.  So one time, I let her come home with me, because my mom was out.  Was she...  How retarded was she?  Was she a slow girl in school, or was she like...  Did she have...  She was the fat kid, the fat girl with the greasy hair and the straight bangs?  I was going to say, the Pete Rose haircut?  Yeah.  All right.  Pretty retarded.  But was she...  But she wasn't, like, her body...  She wasn't mongoloid?  She had, like, a big...  Like, a silverback gorilla forehead.  Like, it's long, but short and angled.  Gotcha.  And, uh...  But not Down syndrome. 
[02:59:30]  She had, like...  Little volcano tits.  You know what I mean?  A fat gut, but just volcano tits.  I was in seventh grade, so...  You were 13.  13.  Now you're officially a teenager.  You moved on from sucking men off to having sex with retards.  And you wonder why you're in therapy.  Trying to cleanse the palate.  Right.  Literally speaking.  So, when did you finally get up to hot chicks?  Last year?  No.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Actually, around 20.  20.  When I got sober, I finally got...  I was like, great.  This is great.  The sober thing really...  Why is every comedian recovering something? 
[03:00:00]  Because they have experiences like this that you've got to drink away.  Exactly.  Exactly.  The second you were sober, before you got sober...  Yeah.  I mean, like, before you got a drink that day...  Yeah.  Would these things just creep in and you were like, oh my god, I need a drink so bad?  Oh, I used to hang out with these guys.  They were all from South Medford, Italian, mafia-type guys, all kick-ass.  And I would be around them all the time and have these thoughts that would enter my head.  And I would get so uncomfortable, it almost came out.  Like, I just wanted to, like, tell them. 
[03:00:30]  If they only knew, they would throw me out of this little...  Oh, I'd be killed.  They'd beat the hell out of me.  All right.  So, you're 13.  She's 7?  No, no, no, no.  She's my age.  You're a friggin' lunatic.  Stop enhancing the story.  No, that's why there was a question mark.  I can't believe he can make the stories worse, but he is.  There was a question mark.  Was she 7?  I'm getting confused here.  She's older.  Oh, 7th grade.  She had the mental capacity of a 7-year-old.  You sick F.  So, yeah, that's true.  Did she talk all weird?  She didn't.  You're stupid! 
[03:01:00]  Was it like that?  Yeah, well, yeah, she was kind of...  She was like that a little bit.  So, I took her back to my house.  You know, there's a guy in Ohio checking in, and I agree with him.  The show is two weeks away from a guy doing the Wiffle Ball Bat Challenge.  No!  Dude, this has to end.  I'm really getting pissed off about this.  It's just...  You know what it is?  It's therapy session.  Why does all of Jimmy's friends have to come in and admit their gay experiences?  I don't know.  We did kind of pull it out of him.  Yeah, you sat there. 
[03:01:30]  Dude, you started off like...  Of course, my friend didn't.  You started off...  Left it right in his mouth.  I tried to sidetrack with pussy eight times.  Yeah.  And you kept going, all right, get back to...  We started off with one of the hottest girls we've ever had on the show.  From me?  We wanted to bow to you, and now we want to shun you, man.  Now you realize what would happen if you bowed to him.  I fucked the sink.  Oh, my God.  Can we get past the sex with retard thing?  No, the retard is a girl, so...  She's a girl.  Oh, yeah.  Sure she is.  She's just a little retarded, and she claps like this with her wrists. 
[03:02:00]  But, so I took her in the basement.  I made her jerk me off with that old, really harsh soap with the little grains of...  Lava?  Yeah, lava soap.  Jesus.  They wash oil off your hands.  You love punishing yourself.  Yeah, it's got granules in it.  Yeah, right, exactly.  Ow.  She's jerking me off, but she's just, you know...  I cleaned off with a Brillo pad.  She kept going, is this how I do it?  Is this okay?  Is this okay?  It hurts my hand.  Asking those same questions you were asking just a year prior.  Turn your hand over, stupid. 
[03:02:30]  Easier fucking a sink.  So I looked up in the window in the basement, and I saw my mother's car pull up.  Uh-oh.  So I said, wait here, wait here, and I just ran upstairs, and my mother came home with  my aunt, and I'm talking to her, and I'm so nervous, and then I'm sitting on the couch  watching TV, but I fell asleep.  Oh, no.  Around four hours later, I woke up.  It was dark out, and I was like, oh, my God.  I forgot all about her in the basement.  I ran around the back, and you know those tornado doors, like the angled doors for the 
[03:03:00]  cellar, the basement doors?  Right, the cellar doors.  I opened it up, and this poor retarded girl was just sitting there shivering.  Oh, my God.  She still had soap on her hands, the fucking cookie soap, and she's sitting there shivering  like, I got to go home.  I was supposed to be home a long time ago.  Yeah.  I got to go home.  All right, retard, finish the job first, and then you can go.  Did you make her finish?  No, I didn't make her finish, but another time I saw her, my friend actually held a rock  over her head until she jerked both of us off. 
[03:03:30]  All right.  I like that.  Oh, my God.  You're a criminal.  Not me.  It was my friend.  You're an accomplice.  No, I'm not.  I told her not to do it.  No, it's not.  It's a retarded girl.  She thought it was fun.  She thought it was to hold the rock over the head game.  Hey, we want to thank Bob Kelly for stopping on by today.  Why did you do that?  He's sorry.

With the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I'm Robert Kelly.  Your cell phone will pass in the night.  Add some enthusiasm, Eric!  Not me on that.  No, you!  Jesus Christ.  I'm talent.

In this next scene here, you're going to describe your cell phone in Pat from Munaki's ass. 
[03:10:00]  Go.  Right.  Okay, great.  Um, ha ha.  Uh, yeah.  This one really made me mad.  This is like a violation.  First of all, Pat's, this is where Pat from Munaki stuck my cell phone, the Trio, back then.  Now I have an iPhone.  And the Trio, the fat one.  And he stuck it in his asshole.  And his asshole looks like fucking two elephant trunks mushed together with peanut butter.  That's what his asshole looks like. 
[03:10:30]  It's just awful.  Did I say elephant trunks?  Yeah.  All right, not the funniest.  Could you help me over here, please?  You're doing good.  Oh, thanks.  All right, all right.  That's all I needed.  I feel bad, too, because I kicked him in the shin.  I did.  I kicked him right in the fucking shin.  I was very angry.  His diabetic leg.  Yeah, I did.  I kicked him right in that fucking diabetic leg.  And I just almost broke in half like wet cardboard because he has no fucking blood in it.  But that would have been awesome if I kicked his shin and it just snapped in half and his foot went across the room and I stuck that in my ass. 
[03:11:00]  Fucking asshole.  He stuck my cell phone in his asshole.  Fucking pissed me off.  So, enjoy.  I guess enjoy.  People like it.  Broadcast of the worst of O.B. and Anthony with Bob Kelly.  Where's Pat from Minaki?  We need the big showstopper today.  Don't blow us off, Pat.  Let's read this fucking faggoty blog.  All right, talking in movie theaters is the headline, current mood, annoyed. 
[03:11:30]  I'm seeing some punctuations that might mean that somebody else might have to read this.  Well, the punctuations are way down over theirs.  All right.  Oh, why?  Because I don't read well?  Oh.  Why do you get a shit on Elp during the day before vacation?  I was, it was.  You could just come out and say it instead of.  I saw big capital letters with exclamation points and I thought.  Well, you could just say it instead of like.  Perhaps midge me.  Oh, that's stupid.  I know what it means when you said that. 
[03:12:00]  You don't want me to read this.  Why would you do that, Anthony?  I'm going to read it upside down.  Sometimes I do that.  To look happy.  Say Frank DeFran.  We want that character to last.  Okay.  Don't mean to tear down the fifth wall or nothing.  What are you saying?  That character's getting old?  I had a good one too from Frank DeFran.  Absolutely.  I had a good one.  Nobody just wants to go home.  You just held it.  I got about four minutes left.  Let's go because I'm in overtime right now. 
[03:12:30]  This is a talking in movie theater, so that would be annoyed.  Okay.  Opie, you want to read this?  I obviously can't read.  Next time you might as well just tell me.  Jesus Christ.  Opie.  You can read the signs.  The one thing I am is smart.  Look, there's three paragraphs here.  And I'm really good at reading people.  Here it is.  I can't read things, but I'm good at reading people.  There's like three solid segments to this. 
[03:13:00]  You read the first one.  Let Midge me read the second one.  Let Bob read the first one.  How about Bob reads the whole thing?  Let Bob read the first one.  I'm not reading that.  All right.  Are you ready?  Let's do this.  Let's do this, Opie.  Because I'm dumber than anybody in this room.  All right.  You're not going to get an argument from anyone.  Read away.  Jeez, I'm sticking up for you.  I know.  I just saw X-Men 3.  Wasn't a big fan of the movie.  Not as good as the others.  But this...  Shit.  Posting isn't about that. 
[03:13:30]  On the show, there was an old bit where Anthony went to see Mission Impossible Deuce.  And people wouldn't shut up in the movie theater.  I happened to be in the same area.  What the fuck is that?  Get him, I got him.  Get him, I got him.  Get him, I got him.  Get him, I got him. 
[03:14:00]  Pat from Munaki.  Had his asshole open while Bob was reading.  Gaping.  Gaping.  He totally distracted him.  That's why I said Bob reads.  I heard Pat was here.  So, Bob's reading.  Pat from Munaki comes up right next to him.  Pulls his pants down and spreads his ass cheeks.  And then...  And Big Kev, good call for coming in the wrist print.  Very nice.  And then who said, like, Bobby, look. 
[03:14:30]  I did, I did.  Yeah, he goes, Bob, look.  Listen, listen.  Bob turned his head.  Oh, God.  He turned his head and was point blank right into Pat's asshole.  Wait, dude, please.  Pat's asshole.  You creep with the microphone.  Dude, I really want you to take Bob's phone. 
[03:15:00]  Oh, God.  And not do anything off with it, but just put it against the back of your balls and take  a picture of it and show it to him while he's on the phone.  Oh, God.  Someone call him.  Yeah, do it.  Yes.  Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.  Make sure it doesn't come in.  Hurry, hurry, hurry, quick.  Turn around, stupid.  We'll erase the picture if you don't want it published.  Get the microphone.  Put it right on it.  Put it on your ball.  Touch it.  Yeah.  No, the mouth part on your ass. 
[03:15:30]  Put it against it.  Put it against it.  Okay.  All right.  Now put it back.  Now put it back where it was.  Put your pants up, my fucking homo.  Put it exactly where it was.  Danny, put it in the sleeve or I'll stab you.  Oh, my God.  And then somebody call him during the show.  What's his number?  All right.  Hold on.  Bob.  He's coming back.  Holy shit.  That is so fucking wrong.  What?  I hope this works out.  What, dude?  Just come back in. 
[03:16:00]  Everything's all right.  That's horrible.  Let me see.  Oh, God, dude.  Let me see, Iraq.  That's fucking gross.  That's the grossest thing I've ever seen in my life.  Oh, God damn.  This asshole was brown.  Yeah.  Brown and yellow.  You should have got the phone.  You all right?  You should have got the phone against it.  We do.  It was yellow and brown and purple.  Yeah.  Do it.  Believe me.  All right.  Listen.  Mike's got it.  Mike's got it.  Let's hit it.  All right.  Listen.  We're doing a bit. 
[03:16:30]  Oh, by the way, save this for when we get back.  Seriously.  Tell him to test his cell phone and call you or something like that.  Tell him to do it.  Like we're doing something else.  We always have competitions about phones.  Yeah, I know.  Maybe.  Like I could say.  Oh, yeah.  No.  Someone just calls number from outside the studio.  No, you might have answered.  Let's make it like we're talking about our phones.  Who cares about how good they are?  Because mine, it's small.  Bob Kelly, everyone.  He's got his pants on.  And I don't care what he's got his pants on.  Dude, you're an asshole.  No, that is disgusting. 
[03:17:00]  Abominable.  And I don't care.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  Okay.  Come in, stupid.  Bring it, buddy.  I'm not a fan.  I don't hate my phone.  Listen, speaking of phones.  No fucking way.  Bob, tell these guys what was happening.  What's going on?  What's going on?  Nothing.  Shut up.  I don't fucking trust you guys.  Actually, what's happening?  I'll tell you.  Listen, tell the guys what happens with your phone.  It hangs up on itself because of your fat cheeks.  Did he put the phone in his ass? 
[03:17:30]  No.  No.  No.  Is that a ring?  Why did we think of that?  No, actually.  My what?  This is actually a legitimate question.  While you were puking and cleaning up.  We thought it was funny because you were talking about when you answer phone calls, you hang  up on yourself because you're a fat cheek.  Mine absolutely will not.  Can I tell you guys something?  You don't go from fucking zero to 60.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You were puking.  We were trying to talk to you.  You didn't have fucking headphones.  So, bit was kind of done.  I can't get his asshole out of my head.  So, we got into the fact that he told about when you hung up with your fat cheek and I  said, that's why I have fucking flip phones. 
[03:18:00]  I set this thing wrong.  This is absolutely...  That's you.  I set this wrong.  It will say that it's calling, but I won't hear anything.  Because I have a setting.  Listen.  And I'll only have a flip phone.  It's connected.  Look.  Because assholes...  Answer and talk to me, but do not...  Assholes just speed dial and fucking call you from the car and they don't even know  that they're fucking talking to you.  He's checking out the phone.  It's fine.  Just do it, you idiot.  It's not ringing.  Huh?  I'm not an idiot.  I'm a human being.  Pick it up and you will hear it.  No, but you're checking out an idiot. 
[03:18:30]  I'm a human being.  We didn't do anything to your phone.  Look, it's not ringing.  I'm looking at the fucking phone.  Why is this not...  It says...  Oh, wait.  Last call.  Hold on.  You probably hung up on it.  I don't have your number.  No, no.  Mine says connected.  Huh?  I need your number.  Three, four, seven.  I didn't have it.  Don't give out his fucking number on the air, you asshole.  You got it?  See, now it says connected.  Seven, eight.  Your phone stinks.  That's why.  No, it's just...  I have a setting wrong.  What's going on?  Try...  Try...  I'm...  Try it.  Try what?  Call me.  I guarantee I'll... 
[03:19:00]  I want to see if it'll ring.  We never exchange numbers.  Like, I don't...  You don't like Bob.  I...  I just got like...  Bob, I now like you.  Like, fan's number is pretty much the only person I have that I really shouldn't have.  Is it ringing?  Yeah, it's ringing.  Yeah, but watch.  Now, it's ringing.  Yeah.  Hello?  Nope.  Yeah, hello.  Do you hear anything from me?  No.  No.  I just...  I don't hear anything.  It does ring.  But now watch.  This is why I have this fucking headphone.  They'll bust my balls about this two headphones. 
[03:19:30]  Oh, this goddamn fucking air traffic controller headphone.  Yeah, I know, but look at this.  Now it's plugged in.  The headphone's plugged in.  I hear you great.  See?  Now can I talk?  This is through my headphone ear.  I can hear you fantastic, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I can hear you.  So I can somehow...  Or that one.  Yeah, I can hear you.  What the fuck is that, dude?  That's...  I mean, it's fucking...  It's like...  What's wrong, Bob?  Is it a fucking vagina?  What's wrong, Bob? 
[03:20:00]  No, no, it's not good.  I don't think you got a good enough look at it.  Wait, Bob, you didn't get a good enough.  There's something a little different about that picture.  Bob, you might want to look at that...  Mike, uh, uh, Bob, you might want to look at that picture a little closely.  I don't want to look at that...  No, just...  Hey, put the fucking phone...  Zoom up.  Well, just take a little look at it.  Just take a look.  Ugh!  I tingled my phone.  You put my phone in your ass, you fucking savage?  No.  No.  Just the back of the phone.  Just the back of the phone. 
[03:20:30]  Dude, wash my fucking phone.  That's over the line.  That's over the line.  A fucking bagel on the ground is one thing.  Show me.  You put my fucking $700 trio in his asshole?  Who fucking does that?  That's over the line.  They made me.  You didn't fucking have to stick it in your ass, you circus freak.  You're a fucking cocksucker.  Now you owe me $700.  I'm not fucking with that phone anymore.  You stuck it in your fucking fat pussy.  I'd pay for a new one with my winnings, too. 
[03:21:00]  Did he stick it in his ass?  I didn't even look at the phone.  No.  Look at the photo.  You have to.  Look at the photo.  You might be happy.  Eric, don't do it.  Don't worry so much.  Your mic went out, Jimmy.  Look at the picture.  The mic went out.  He's looking at the picture now.  Eric.  Oh.  Oh.  You all right, Bob?  Oh, God.  Bob, you all right?  What's wrong with this asshole?  Has a phone in it.  I'm with you on that.  I really don't know, but there is something wrong with this. 
[03:21:30]  You see the asshole.  Did you fucking crack a glove?  It really is red and open.  22 Nathan's hot dogs went through that asshole.  Dude, it looks like an open wound.  Yeah.  It looks like a fucking...  See your phone?  E-Rock, you're off the hook.  Your face was right up there right now.  We'll read the blog when we get back.  Oh, fuck.  I gotta wash my phone now, because his fucking cunt was in it.  That's fine.  What the fuck was it?  The mouth part, stupid.  The part you put up to your face.  The ear part.  Oh, God. 
[03:22:00]  He's fucking in it.  How can anybody not like that?  Bob, by the way, I'm sorry I called you a liar.  I'm sorry.  Bob, look at me for a second.  Bob.  Bob, turn around, please.  Jimmy's ass is right in his face. 
[03:22:30]  Poor Bob has such a...  Bob!  Bob!  Bob!  He has such a...  A very, um...  He has a sour stuff.  No, he doesn't have any, uh, uh...  What is that called?  Stomach bile left?  Like, some people can take that shit.  That is classic.  Others, like...  He's got no constitution for that kind of thing.  All right. 
[03:23:00]  The phone...  When he saw the picture of the phone touching the back of your ball sack.  That echoes.  Oh, is that fucking funny.  He pukes on Torgasm a bunch, too, man.  He's the real deal.  Bob!  Goddamn fucking...  Bob!  Can he hear us in there?  No.  Oh.  Yeah, I gotcha.  Bob!  How'd the phone smell? 
[03:23:30]  Oh, his fucking ass was in my phone.  You're, uh...  You're a good sport.  You're a good sport to the Opie and Anthony show.  You all right?  Are you feeling any better?  Why would you put my fucking phone in something like that?  In something like that.  Pat's gonna cry.  It's not that bad.  You should talk on that phone again.  You should get that fucking tumor removed.  I don't know what the hell was going on with that.  I don't even want to know. 
[03:24:00]  Jim.  Is that Jim?  What?  Jim, don't.  I don't want to see your ass, Jim.  Yeah, Jimmy told me to stall.  Jim, are you pissing on the ground?  Dude, you're pissing on the ground.  What kind of fucking freak show is this?  Jimmy will just walk in the bathroom and start pissing on the floor.  He's a fucking animal.  Oh, God.  Just put down wood chips for him.  Like wood shavings.  He's like a fucking hamster.  How do you wash his cell phone? 
[03:24:30]  You don't.  By the way, Danny the Trucker is saying this is revenge for Bob's anti-trucker promo he did.  Yeah, that must be it.  That's exactly it.  All right, are you boys done in there?  Oh, God.  Bob?  Yeah, I'm coming.  All right.  I'll see you guys later.  I think I'm puking up blood.  No.  Yeah, blood just came out.  No way.  Yep.  All right.  What happened, Mars?  He wants the wipes.  Give me the wipes.  Why are you? 
[03:25:00]  Oh, he's got to wipe your phone.  Oh, he's going to sterilize your phone with a licep over there.  Dude, dude, dude, dude.  Dude, dude.  Bob's.  I can hear you, you cocksucker.  You little dirt monger.  Well, what do you think he said?  I don't.  He said something.  All right.  What's he doing?  I'm not coming.  What do you think, stupid?  What do you think he's doing?  I don't know.  Oh.  Oh.  Don't.  What's wrong?  Oh, he's running.  He just kicked out of the knee. 
[03:25:30]  Don't kick him.  He's kicking.  Oh, boy.  He's kicking back.  Bob is fucking leaving.  Bob is at it.  Look, Bob is pissed.  Bob is at it.  What?  He put the.  He just threw a Danish.  At the side.  At the side.  I can't see it again.  He doesn't give a crap.  We're out of here.  We're out of here.  Bob Kelly, thank you.  Thank you, Bob. 
[03:26:00]  Ladies and gentlemen.  Bob Kelly is hosting the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Hey, this is one time I was in the studio.  Something happened.  And then the guys fucking busted my balls.  And then that's it.  Enjoy.  Broadcasting the worst of Opie and Anthony with Bob Kelly.  Hey, I want to get back to Bobby with this crying thing.  So secret millionaire makes you cry?  Yeah.  Dude, look, let me tell you something.  I have something happen to me where, you know, I opened something up like in therapy 
[03:26:30]  like a year and a half ago.  Like we went back to when little Bobby, they used to call me.  Let me just tell you.  First of all, they used to call me Spiff.  I wasn't Bobby.  It's Spiff.  Spiff.  Oh, we're hanging with Spiff today, Ant.  Spiff.  What a cute little nickname.  Because my mother used to let my hair grow long.  And I used to wear suspender shorts and a bow tie every day.  Get out of here.  I swear to God, I'll get you a picture.  How old were you?  I don't know why.  18.  How you guys get us all... 
[03:27:00]  You guys give us all the open up and just throw our garbage on the table.  And then we go.  And then you give it to the savages on Pal Talk.  Yeah.  Then we just smash in the face.  How old were you that it was acceptable to wear a bow tie and suspender shorts, Anthony?  Not suspender like...  Because suspenders, some of the older folk in the audience will remember, it was in style  for about a day or two.  Yeah.  It really was.  You were wearing lederhosen.  Yes. 
[03:27:30]  Yes.  You were wearing lederhosen.  Yeah.  It was very similar to that.  How old were you, really?  I'm not good with that age.  I don't know.  I can't go back with...  Hey, I must have been...  I don't know.  Just remember who was beating you at the time and then do the math.  Well, this is the point.  You're right.  You're absolutely right.  I know I'm right.  I wasn't getting beat at the time.  I was actually...  All right.  That's good.  This was just before the BM stepped into my life.  Oh, yeah.  The stepfather.  I say BM because I don't want to give his name over the radio, but... 
[03:28:00]  All right.  So, it had to be before first grade.  Wow.  First grade, I was spiff.  So, you got this out in therapy?  Well, we went back to spiff.  Right.  I just started talking to spiff.  Gotcha.  Did you...  Were you talking to spiff in therapy?  No.  You're not one of those weirdos, are you?  I was just...  Can we talk to a little spiff?  Let's talk to spiff.  Can we talk to a little spiff?  Hi.  Is spiff with us today?  Spiff?  Please tell me you talked to spiff.  Hi, LP.  How are you?  Everything's great today. 
[03:28:30]  Who else do we have in the room today?  Yeah.  Oh, I hate those.  We have Billy.  Hi, Billy.  Billy.  No need to be angry.  I'm not angry.  Oh, no.  It scares spiff.  Don't take me into the closet.  Don't take me into the closet.  Psycho babble crap.  I don't want to put it in my mouth.  Oh, God.  Oh, is that good?  Young spiff.  I love those dummies out there that think they could cure the multi-personality person. 
[03:29:00]  Who are we talking to now?  The guy that's got to pay for this crap, I guess?  Right.  The guy that signs the check and gives it to you?  Like an idiot?  No, he doesn't do that.  My therapist, I actually, the one thing he does is he looks at the clock.  I catch him looking at the clock.  See, that's why I can't do that.  And I actually called him on.  I go, you look at the clock again.  I'm going to smash you.  Thank you.  He goes, you're not paying me enough to not look at that clock.  That's probably the only reason I...  He's good. 
[03:29:30]  Probably the only reason why I don't go into therapy because I know they're just there like,  uh-huh, yeah, I'll care about you for the next hour.  And then I got the next dummy waiting to get in here.  No, this guy's good.  Yeah.  I actually like Alan.  Alan Lefkowitz.  But he, yeah, you know what it was?  Is we started talking about that stuff.  And that's the stuff that you forget, you push down, and you just, you know, you'll  talk about it casually.  Yeah.  But when you start talking about it for real, little spiff, little spiff that was happy,  you know, lived in the Irish Catholic home with 13 people, but everybody was still happy. 
[03:30:00]  My uncles slept all over and my aunts had a room.  Me and my mother slept on a mattress on the floor, my grandmother, my grandfather, but  we all, you know, had food.  The little rascals?  Yeah, it was like that.  The hell is going on?  It was a really good time.  Sounds like some old scene from the 30s.  My uncle would take me in the back and teach me how to make, we talked about it last week,  making bow and arrows.  One uncle would teach me how to fight.  The other one taught me math.  The other one taught me how to, like, you know, like do work and, like, get a job done. 
[03:30:30]  And, you know, my grandfather taught me about life.  It was really, and then my mother.  It sounds very, like, nice and educational and everything.  How did you get so screwed up?  Well, then my mother apparently got lonely, the insecure twizzer that she is, and she  met some guy that was just bugging her, just bugging her to get married.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, he really, that's what she told me later in life.  He just kept bugging me to get married.  And finally, I was like, you know what?  Screw it.  What happened?  A little spiff.  And then we moved in, and I remember, I'll tell you the day that it happened, we moved 
[03:31:00]  into the brand new apartment.  This guy had money, too.  He was an insurance adjuster.  He had one of those wheels on a stick in the back of his trunk that he would, you know,  walk.  You'd have to walk and chalk off how much, how many feet were skid marks before the disaster.  Yeah, yeah, things like that.  Right, exactly.  He had the Monte Carlo with the T-roofs and the spokes.  Oh, wow.  Back when that was the T-roof.  Remember the T-roof?  If you had to take it off, put it in the trunk.  Sure.  Pan the ass. 
[03:31:30]  I'll hold the fat chick.  Just hold my T-roofs as we drive.  Best thing about those, they never leaked.  Ever.  Ever.  Ever.  They didn't figure that one out.  Not a drop came through.  They couldn't figure that one out.  No, they couldn't.  But we moved into the new apartment.  Out of my grandmother's house, we were packed in.  We were sleeping on a mattress on the floor.  We moved into the new apartment.  I remember walking into my bedroom, and I had this beautiful ceiling fixture.  Like a light, but it was like a modern chandelier. 
[03:32:00]  And I had a toy box full of toys, brand new.  A desk full of desk stuff.  This is the best life ever.  Yeah, right.  Like young Spiff.  Right.  With a little English hat on and knickers.  I could just picture you in suspenders.  Thank you, Mom.  You sure they were calling you Spiff and not?  What?  Spiff.  Because of your Hispanic background?  Oh, my mother did that to me, too. 
[03:32:30]  Well, I looked more Asian when I was young.  She used to hold me up, and I used to cry every time she did it, too.  Hysterically crying.  She used to hold me up and go, someday a woman's going to come to the door, Bobby, and go,  Oh, Mrs. Kelly, you got a wrong baby.  And then I would cry.  Oh, and you'd cry.  Yeah.  Oh.  But I was still Spiff.  Poor young Spiff.  Yeah.  But then I remember, this is what happened, Rennie.  I had my brand new room.  My sister had her own room.  They had a room.  I'm not hearing anything bad yet.  Okay.  So I'm in.  It's all good.  It's like a fabulous childhood. 
[03:33:00]  If we end the story now, you had a great childhood.  Yeah.  Let's just end it here.  I had a little side room on my room, like a little side room with a couple beanbags  and a TV and a set of binoculars, because if you got the binoculars and looked out that  window, there was a drive-in that you could actually watch movies from.  Oh.  Right.  I remember watching Benji.  Remember Benji?  What a perfect childhood.  This is awesome.  So one day, I fell asleep in the beanbag.  I was watching my TV, my little TV, my little 13-inch black and white TV that was mine. 
[03:33:30]  Benji Biff is in his own room.  And I remember waking up, and it went from day to night.  You know, when you nap from day to night, it's kind of a...  Yeah, I do it all the time, believe me.  And I woke up, and I remember waking up with a smile on my face, like happy.  I remember being happy.  And I went out to the kitchen, and I opened the door, and it was like opening a door to  traffic, because I remember my sister had a phone cord wrapped around her neck, crying. 
[03:34:00]  My mother was screaming and crying, and this guy was walking around with his fish clenched.  And my sister went to make a phone call.  He grabbed the phone cord, wrapped it around her, and threw it at her head.  Then my mother went to grab him, and he punched her in the stomach.  And then my mother grabbed my sister and me, ran into the bedroom, and I tried to shut  the door, and I was trying to hold the door.  Oh, young Spiff was trying to protect his family.  Right?  They're crying. 
[03:34:30]  Now, he's six...  I think he was six four.  Oh, wonderful.  Okay?  I'll remember there's a foot coming through the door.  Let's go...  Like a horror movie.  Oh, no.  The door goes flying.  Here's Johnny.  And this is what I remember.  This is what I...  Did your mom send you through the bathroom window to slide down the big snow bank and  get to the snow cat?  Foot comes through the door.  I was retracing my footsteps in blood.  Yeah.  So, the foot comes through the door.  I go flying against the wall. 
[03:35:00]  Now, this is what...  I mean, I was a coward at this age.  Aw.  This is what, like, probably affects my rage now.  Yeah.  Like, when I get so angry.  You're making up for it now.  Well, he...  I remember I pretended to be hurt because I was so scared.  Yeah.  Like, I kind of...  I pretended to get knocked out.  Like, I hit the wall, but I wasn't.  Oh, really?  And I kind of just slid down the wall.  Like, he would feel bad for me, but he didn't.  Now, you're an easier target.  An unconscious Spiff.  Yeah. 
[03:35:30]  And he just came in.  He just started screaming.  He goes, shut up.  You...  You know, he just started snapping.  What was he mad at...  What was he mad about?  I...  You know what, dude?  Can I just tell you something?  I swear to God, you should be my therapist.  I never asked my mom what that was about.  What happened there?  But my mother's Irish Catholic, so she's going to...  Can't we just forget about it?  Why do you...  Can't we just move on?  Bury it.  Swallow it.  Put it in a deep, dark spot in your body where it'll never come out.  Oh, really? 
[03:36:00]  Oh, God.  You heard that as a kid?  Oh, yeah.  They swallow it.  So you have no idea why this guy turned into a complete lunatic.  It was, honest to God, the first time I ever saw that type of rage.  Of rage and anger and violence.  I never saw it.  Never saw it.  I saw my uncle's fight, but it was always stupid stuff.  I never, ever saw it.  Young Spiff's perfect little life right then was just turned topsy-turvy.  Because my mother was a lonely bitch. 
[03:36:30]  And had to marry this friggin' violent idiot.  How did it end?  He slammed the door, and then I remember us just holding each other.  Like, we were connected.  That's a horrible scene if you've got to do that.  We were just all holding each other and just shaking and crying.  Oh, my God.  Oh, oh.  What the hell, Bobby?  Oh, man.  You were living in that dumb movie with the red wagon.  What was the name of that?  Oh, yes.  The radio flyer.  The radio flyer. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah, the king.  Yeah, the king.  The king came in.  Your mom married the king.  That was the last time I talked to Spiff.  Or you're like, what's his name?  Dwight Yoakam in Sling Blade.  Yeah.  Get out of my house!  What do you mean the last time you talked to Spiff?  You were Spiff.  Yeah, I know.  That's the last time it was Spiff.  Yeah, that was it.  That was the last time I was Spiff.  Spiff was his innocence.  That was his young innocence.  Right after that, he became Bobby.  Bob.  Bob Kelly.  That was it.  The young, happy Spiff was dead. 
[03:37:30]  Did she kick him to the curb, or was it kind of like...  Cut to five years later.  Five years later.  Five years.  They were together for five years?  I got kicked out of Catholic school because of him.  Because I went in with a black eye one day.  He punched me in the face.  Yeah.  And I went into school with a black eye.  And I had already learned how to stuff the...  Because the teacher was like, what happened?  I was like, nothing.  And I got a black eye, and I'm trying to hold back tears.  And they had to take me out in the hall.  And then I had to tell them what happened. 
[03:38:00]  And then they were like, you know, we can't have this here.  So I got kicked out of Catholic school.  We can't have this here.  They didn't call, like, the police.  It was like, hey, get out of our school.  You're making us look bad.  Yeah, what a lovely religion.  Your mom married Dwight Yoakam.  Yeah.  He was bad.  Listen to the replay.  Oh, you said it?  Oh, fuck.  I had a good one, too.  I even said Dwight Yoakam from Sling Blade.  From Sling Blade.  Oh, my God.  And I even added a line in, get out of my house.  I didn't hear.  I'm sorry.  I did a whole Dwight Yoakam thing. 
[03:38:30]  That's fine.  I did, like, ten minutes on Dwight Yoakam.  It's good to know I'm in good company.  I like this guy.  Um, so, you've got to be mad at your mom.  Yeah.  We're staying in this for five years.  Well, this is even the thing now, is that, you know, I mean, you know, we cut to five  years later.  She's finally leaving him.  And, well, what happened was, you know, he would call my sister fat.  All right.  I'm with you now.  We're back on the same thing. 
[03:39:00]  He would call my sister fat, and they hit me, and, you know, all this stuff.  And then, this is what changed.  This is where I snapped.  This is where I realized violence, rage, and anger has more of an effect, and almost  feels better than trying, because nobody talks to you.  Nobody helps you through this stuff.  He, uh, he came after me one day, yelling at me, screaming at me, and I grabbed a knife,  and he actually went, go ahead, do it.  Wow.  Without even hesitating, I came down with the knife.  He moved his hand. 
[03:39:30]  Then I chased him around the house with the knife.  I was in sixth grade.  Okay?  Sixth grade, and you're ready to murder somebody.  Murder him, dude.  My mother came down and grabbed me, and, like, had to hold me back.  I was like, I'm going to kill him.  I'm going to kill him.  Because he tried to make me do yard work on, like, a Sunday or a Saturday, some crappy...  But that's what parents do.  I wouldn't do anything this guy told me to do.  It wasn't, it wasn't that.  It was his...  We all had chores to do on weekends.  I didn't cry.  No.  Chores would, one thing, he used to make me do, like, the stuff that he should do. 
[03:40:00]  Like, you know, dig out a stump.  You know?  What was his problem?  Dig out a stump at 12 years old.  Hard work.  I'm in sixth grade.  I'm out there.  He'd make me do it with, like, a spoon.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Two days later, Bobby's still following where the roots are going.  Yeah.  What the hell?  Yeah.  What is the matter with you?  Digging up sidewalks to get to more root.  Right.  Was he a drinker?  What was his deal?  We've got to take a break, but wrap the... 
[03:40:30]  He wasn't a drinker.  He wasn't a drinker.  I don't know what he was.  He was just, I think his...  How bad do you want to punch him in the face right now?  I actually saw him.  When?  No way.  I saw him one time.  I worked at Grossman's Bargain Outlet in the indoor-outdoor carpet section.  Oh.  And I used to roll myself up in the carpet and take naps.  And one day, I unrolled myself after my little lovely nap, and I looked over...  And there he was, beating your family again.  You know, I hate face cloths because of this guy, because every morning he would take a shower  and he would dry his hair with a face cloth, like, just rub it over and over and over 
[03:41:00]  and then part his hair to the side perfectly with one of those combs, and then get that  guy hairspray, I forget the name of it, and spray...  Ugh.  Just for men.  Yeah, something like that.  One of those man products.  I actually had to leave.  I ran out, and I had to take off.  Because he wasn't as big to me anymore, because I was like, you know, I was 18 at the time,  high school.  You should have punched him in the face.  I know.  Although it's so easy to say everything, you just, like me, start crying. 
[03:41:30]  I just remember this.  All he wanted was a Corvette.  That's all he kept complaining, and we...  He couldn't get a Corvette because of us, because of the money he had to spend on his  family.  Right.  And he finally got a Corvette, but apparently he got so fat, he couldn't fit into it anymore,  so we had to sell it.  Nice.  Shut your goddamn pie hole!  All right, Bobby.  Thanks for sharing.  That's insane.  We're going to take a quick break and continue.  I know a thing or two about a thing or two.  Fancy talk.  Fancy talk for a whore. 
[03:42:00]  I can't watch that movie.  I bet.  I bet, man.  It's close to home, huh?  So it leads to today where you cry at shows like Secret Millionaire.  My wife walked in last night.  She thought somebody died.  Oh.  I'm just sniffling.  Extreme Home Makeover?  I can't watch it.  Yeah, a little rough, right?  I can't watch it.  I can't.  I can't.  What's some of those other shows you cry at?  Little people, big ones.  Biggest loser. 
[03:42:30]  Johnny Cate.  Plus A.  The struggles.  The thing war.  Little Spiff is dead.  He died that day.  No, no.  Spiff.  Spiff.  Spiff is dead.  Yeah, but he died that day.  No, see, what Bobby's saying is Spiff is back.  Spiff was reborn.  Yeah, he's got a new innocence, right?  Am I leading?  I don't know.  You know what?  I think you've come full circle, like you finally got rid of the tough Bobby, like I  got to protect everybody and my mom and my sister, and now I allow Spiff back into my 
[03:43:00]  life, and I enjoy the simple things that life offers.  No, I still punch the fridge.  All right, well.  If you back my wife's head into the fridge, my punch marks go around her head perfectly.  Great.  I was going for the happy ending.  You chose to living in hell.  Ladies and gentlemen, Bob Kelly is hosting the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Hey, it's the worst of Opie and Anthony, hosted by me, Robert Kelly.  We have more of this stupid shit coming up right after the break. 
[03:43:30]  We're back with the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I'm Robert Kelly.  I think this company lost money today.  They actually lost subscribers.  Can I find out how many people didn't listen to this show?  This is the fucking stupidest thing ever.  This next bit, what do you call these things?  Segments?  I know, I know.  Look, it's almost over.  I hope this is at the end.  This is almost, it's almost over.  This is when my little story about the not you story.  I'm not going to ruin it.  I'm not going to give a spoiler away for the new ONA listeners, all three of them. 
[03:44:00]  But this is the not you story.  This is my encounter with Jerry Seinfeld.  Broadcasting the worst of Opie and Anthony with Bob Kelly.  Hey guys, let's say hi to Bob Kelly.  Bob.  Bob.  Bobby.  Bob.  Bob.  What's up?  What's up?  Hi fella.  How are you doing, man?  Can you hear us?  Hello.  Hello.  Bob, can you hear us?  Yeah, I can hear.  Are you guys fucking with me with that whole thing? 
[03:44:30]  No, no, actually not.  We're not.  We're actually out of time with the phones.  The phones have had problems all day.  Oh yeah, what's up, man?  Uh, Colin was in the other day, and he was telling us a story about, um, you and Seinfeld.  And it was a little embarrassing?  Uh, yeah, that friggin' son of a bitch Seinfeld douchebag.  Uh, would you like to tell us the story?  Yeah, I feel like I'm on The Tonight Show right now.  Hey, Johnny. 
[03:45:00]  Norton's Ed.  Um, I don't want to be Ed.  I want to be Doc.  Take one up the keister.  Is he gay?  I, uh...  He always seemed a little flamboyant.  Oh.  Seemed a little Noah-like.  That's like, that, remember when he was filming Comedian?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Seinfeld, yeah.  Well, he was, that son of a bitch was coming down with this little camera crew, and I never  talked to him.  I never said nothing to him.  I never say nothing to famous people when they come down there.  And there's certain comedians that help.  You're talking about the comedy cellar, by the way, where most of that movie Comedian 
[03:45:30]  was filmed.  Yes.  Thank you.  Where all the big-time New York comics hang out when they're not on the road.  Right.  All right, there you go.  Sorry.  Thanks.  So, this son of a bitch comes down.  I never say nothing to him.  I just, you know, some comedians kiss their asses, you know.  Yeah.  Especially, he was filming, so there were certain comedians, Godfrey, that were just, you  know, sticking their faces in.  And, uh, I never said nothing to him.  One night, he said something to me. 
[03:46:00]  I say something back.  I feel like we build up a rapport.  Rapport?  You know what I mean?  Like, it was, like, organic.  What did he say?  Excuse me?  Yeah.  What's the code?  Because there's a door code to get down.  Is this seat taken?  Well, you know, it was kind of like a little conversation we had.  Yeah.  What was it about, Bob?  Was it something like a...  All right.  So, it wasn't that much of a conversation, but it was enough for me to maybe say hi to  him again.  Yeah. 
[03:46:30]  You know what I mean?  He said, uh...  Did he ask why you were looking at that midget and crying?  Ooh.  Is that the first time he's done it?  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  All right.  Where is that midget on?  I'll never live that down.  No.  You won't.  Uh...  And you wonder why I fuck sinks.  So, uh...  So, when I did this gig up in Buffalo, two days later, the worst gig of my life, I have 
[03:47:00]  to hire my own driver to pick me up to drive me to the gig.  This guy picks me up in a van, one of those, you know, one of those, you know, cool vans  with the captain seats and the TV and the, you know, VCR.  Nice.  So, he's got every Seinfeld episode ever, ever, ever.  And he's got headphones on.  And he's not watching and he's listening to them.  Jesus.  This guy's a Seinfeld freak. 
[03:47:30]  So, we go, we're driving to the gig, he's telling me about Seinfeld, he finds out I'm  a comedian.  He starts calling me Jerry.  Oh, jeez.  Oof.  I took him out to, we went to lunch, you know, because we had like an hour to kill.  Yeah.  So, the whole time he's telling me about, you know, his family and he's, you know, he's  like, Jerry.  And I'm like, Bob.  He's like, oh, I know, but I just really like Jerry.  So, I'm like, okay, call me Jerry.  Oh, my God.  That's weird.  Did he ask you to listen to an audio cassette of his stand-up and put you on his show?  Jerry. 
[03:48:00]  Jerry.  Jerry.  So.  Ma.  Nice talking to you.  So, this guy, this guy asked me for an autograph, but, you know, I was like, you know what,  I might be able to get you one, because I just talked to him the other night for the  first time, me and my new buddy.  Yeah.  So, then I go to do this gig.  It's outside, after a band, in the rain, in the afternoon, next to a skydiving simulator,  at a beer fest. 
[03:48:30]  So, how was the gig?  It was all right.  It wasn't that bad.  I pulled it off.  You pulled it off.  So, this gig was hell.  So, I go back to New York.  I met this guy.  I mean, I lived at Seinfeld episode.  Yeah.  This guy, the whole gig with the thing and the flight simulator.  I can't wait to see Jerry and tell him the gig, you know, tell him about the gig.  Like, so, the first time we talked, we made a bet. 
[03:49:00]  I was making bets, and he jumped in on the bet.  So, I owed him a buck, because he won the bet.  That's why, that was our conversation.  Oh, okay.  So, he's on stage.  Do you remember what the bet was?  Yeah, it was if Gretzky was on the team that, when the Rangers won the Stanley Cup.  And, no, he wasn't.  All right.  And, so, he walks off stage, and I got my dollar out, and there's, like, a crowd of people going nuts.  He walks by me at the foot of the stairs in the cellar, and I go, here's your buck.  You won the bet. 
[03:49:30]  And, he looks at me with, like, almost take that, you know, he could smell dog shit, but he doesn't know where it is.  Look.  And, he took the buck, which kind of annoyed me that he took the buck.  Of course.  And, he didn't say nuts.  All right, don't worry about it.  He took it.  Yeah.  I go, but I got a story for you first.  He goes, you want your buck back?  So, in my head, I'm like, what a fucking dick.  And, he walks up two stairs, and he turns around, and he goes, I'll be upstairs in the back corner eating. 
[03:50:00]  So, when you're done, come up, and we'll talk upstairs.  So, I go, all right, man.  I'll be up.  I'm doing my set.  Right after my set, I'll come up.  We'll sit.  We'll talk.  He goes, not you.  He was talking to the lady next to me.  I was so, you understand, there's a crowd of people there. 
[03:50:30]  The lady next to me looked at me like, I'm sorry.  Oh, God.  And, then he just walked up the stairs.  How embarrassing.  Oh, for that split second, you're like, oh, my God.  Jerry's inviting me up to his table.  I'm going to hang.  And, then, not you.  Just the fact that I assumed that he would invite me from two sentences to sitting down and having food with the guy.  Right.  And, I'm like, yeah, I'll be right.  I said it so confident, too. 
[03:51:00]  I was like, good.  I've got to do my set.  But, right when I'm done with my set, I'll be up and I'll join you.  And, then, we'll talk about stories.  I've got to do my craft.  Not you.  And, that Jew voice.  That, his just big fat lips.  Just not you.  That's a good story.  Oh, that rings through my head.  Oh, of course it does.  Anytime my self says not you, it rings through my fucking head.  You know how embarrassing it is when you're walking down the street and someone waves and goes, hey. 
[03:51:30]  And, you wave back and then you realize it's somebody behind you that they're waving at.  It's the worst feeling.  And, you're all embarrassed.  It's got to be that times a thousand.  Because, it's Jerry Seinfeld.  And, you're in front of people.  And, that is the worst.  When Colin told me that, I couldn't stop laughing and feeling bad for you.  I cried like you at a midget wedding.  Dude, I, let me tell you something.  I, in my head, in like a split second, I literally saw myself being on his new show. 
[03:52:00]  See?  I'm the new Kramer and I was just a superstar.  For a split second, like.  Colin Norton, Colin, just blowing him off.  Jerry's inviting me to his table.  This is great.  All right, I'll be up right after I do my set.  Not you.  I finally made it.  Like, Jerry will tell people about Bob.  Like, oh, you've got to sit and talk to this guy.  He's out of his mind.  He's crazy.  Yeah.  Bob, they've, um, they've offered me a show.  And, uh, I need a help. 
[03:52:30]  I need a writer.  Yeah.  Just like, uh, Larry was on Seinfeld.  I'd like you to be on, uh, this new project I'm working on.  Yeah, we need a professional, uh, person who knows about, uh, eating ass.  And, uh, all those.  And effing sinks.  And, uh.  Maybe you could be the tear Nazi.  The tear Nazi.  People come in with a sad story and you just cry and they walk out of your establishment.  God forbid I show emotion to a little girl who can't touch her face.  Little girl?  She was a woman. 
[03:53:00]  Just happened to be a two foot tall.  We finally got the audio of that.  We're going to play after the break, by the way.  Finally.  We've been looking for that audio for weeks.  All right, Bob.  We're going to let you go.  We might call you back because I think we're going to play the midget audio as well today.  All right, guys.  I love all you guys.  You're the best, Bob.  Not you.  Well.  See you, man.  Bye.  All right.  There he goes.  Bob Kelly.  How awful.  Is that just an embarrassing story?  That's great.  Like, looking up the stairs at Jerry, looking down at you, he says, when you're done, come 
[03:53:30]  on up.  We'll eat and talk.  And for that split, because you know, as a comic, he's standing there going, this is  great.  Oh, my God.  What an in.  You know, if you're going to network with a comedian, Seinfeld's the guy that you want  to network with.  The guy, you know, took stand-up comedy and turned it into what every stand-up comic wants,  the most successful sitcom in history, you know?  And there he is, ready to go.  All the fantasies rushing through Bob's head.  Oh, yeah, I'm going to do this. 
[03:54:00]  I'm going to tell.  The friends he's going to tell.  He's thinking about the friends he's going to tell that he hung out with Jerry, and he  invited him up to his table.  And the comedians that will see him walking in.  Right.  Like, we're all walking in, and there's Bob at Seinfeld's table, chatting, having some  fun.  Chatting away.  Jerry throwing his head back, laughing at Bob's banter.  Bob.  And Bob going, dude, I just can't do it.  I can't give you six weeks, Jerry.  I can't.  It's impossible.  It's impossible.  And then in that split second, in that split second, not you. 
[03:54:30]  Because the comedy cellar, when you walk out of the showroom, you can make a right to leave,  or the steps up to the left will take you up to the olive tree, and it's very cramped.  Yeah.  And everybody, if Seinfeld was speaking, everybody is silently listening.  Of course.  Everyone heard it.  What a wonderfully horrible story.  Oh, dude, it's just awful.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Bob Kelly is hosting the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[03:55:00]  Hey, this is Bob Kelly.  And what you're about to listen to now is different than the rest.  This is more serious, more adult, more sensual.  This is the bit about my voiceover demo.  So I hope you enjoy.  And thanks again for listening to XM Sirius Radio.  This is Bob Kelly.  Over and out.  Day or night.  Broadcasting the worst of Opie and Anthony with Bob Kelly.  Hey, we got a Robert Kelly voiceover demo. 
[03:55:30]  The only one I've ever booked from this is an angry baby.  I'm not even kidding.  What did they need an angry baby?  I don't know.  How did that voice go?  Hey, you.  Over here.  Come here.  Now.  Hey.  That's Joe Pesci.  Yeah, but it's an angry baby if they put a baby to it.  No, it's Joe Pesci.  If they say.  Yeah, but if it was in North Carolina.  If they say this is an angry baby.  Does that sound like an angry baby?  It sounds like Norris doing the mini wheat.  Exactly.  This is Joe Pesci. 
[03:56:00]  Ready?  Yeah.  What the fuck kind of people are they, huh?  Come here.  Hey, Jesus.  Hey, Henry.  Come here.  Now it turned into angry baby.  No, this is angry baby.  This is angry baby.  All right, wait.  Let us.  All right.  You do one.  This is angry baby for the abortion clinic.  Come on down.  We got a two for one.  What fucking product needed angry baby?  Yeah.  It was a health care thing.  Was it health care?  Yeah.  And what was wrong with the baby that he was angry?  I was mad.  I was mad because.  All right.  Hold on.  You do the voice and I will guess Joe Pesci or angry baby.  Go ahead.  Listen.  Let me tell you something here. 
[03:56:30]  This health care plan stinks for me.  I think it's a trick.  Baby Pesci.  Baby Pesci.  Baby Pesci.  Baby Pesci.  That was the angry baby.  All right.  Now Joe Pesci.  All right.  Ready?  Spider.  Give me a fucking drink.  Jesus.  There's a slight difference.  As an actor, I made a choice.  Hold on.  We're going to do this.  Joe's not angry in that one.  Do the famous line from Goodfellas.  All right.  The Spidey and all that.  All right.  What the fuck kind of people are they?  Hey.  Henry.  Come here.  There you go. 
[03:57:00]  I like that.  All right.  Okay.  Now do the exact same line as the angry baby.  All right.  Here we go.  What the hell kind of people are they?  Henry.  Come here.  You owe Joe Pesci some money for your new character.  Wow.  That is the same exact voice.  It's slightly different.  It's slightly different.  Slightly different.  It is.  And the first one, I said, hey, what kind of people are they?  The second one, I said, what kind of people are they?  Right.  That's true.  The baby wouldn't know how to use hey.  You changed it up a little bit.  I changed it up a little bit. 
[03:57:30]  The fuck?  Ooh, this guy's a fucking moron.  All right.  Well, Bob Kelly's voiceover demo.  Some samples.  Here we go.  Here's you talking about Gamefly.  We like the guys.  I love Gamefly.  When's the last time the mail got you this excited?  Now at Gamefly.com, you can rent every new release for PS2, Xbox, and GameCube, and it  won't cost you anything.

[03:58:00]  That whole Boston thing, man.  Jesus Christ, does that come through?  You know what's weird?  For your Xbox.  Xbox.  Gamefly.com.  Come here, Joe.  There's 49 states going, I ain't buying this shit just because of his voice.  We can offer you.  But those aren't real.  We can offer you socks tickets, for God's sake, you motherfucker.  Hey.  Hey, Sully, come here for a second, you cock fuck.  Sully, where's your PSP?  I got some good fucking games for this shit.  I'm going to fucking kick it right in your neck with this fucking ninja game. 
[03:58:30]  Look at this wicked, cool fucking game.  Watch this.  I hit X, diamond, and left one, you fuck face.  You're a fish-faced enemy of the people, you fucking weirdo.  All right, well, you were just playing the regular guy there.  That was a regular guy.  That was a regular guy.  I'm expecting your voice to be a little different for the Wendy's read.  Is it?  Don't tell me it's the same fucking voice.  The whole thing is.  Now he does baby popping.  All right, let's listen to the Wendy's read.  It's quick.  Who can enjoy a full moon on an empty stomach? 
[03:59:00]  Now, no one has to.  Wendy's late night.  Classic single, classic double, classic triple.  Eat great, even late.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  What is that one?  That's a movie guy.  This is the weirdest thing, though, is the guy told me while I was doing this.  I was actually jerking him off while I was doing it just to get into the mood.  Literally.  You could still be there.  Wendy's closing.  Wendy's single.  You were using the movie guy voice, in a small town, that guy.  Was I? 
[03:59:30]  Yeah.  It was definitely the drama was there.  Now, hold on.  Hold on.  I'm thinking something here.  I'm hearing the music.  I'm hearing the voice.  Now, the voice corresponds with the music.  Right.  Did you know what type of music they were going to play before you did the voice, or did  they use their knowledge and expertise to put the music?  Because that dramatic Wendy's music is behind your dramatic read voice.  It would be funny if there was carnival music behind that.  Right.  This is the choice I made.  All right.  When I heard the music, I was actually, picture a night where you can see the moon, but the 
[04:00:00]  clouds are going in front of it.  Uh-huh.  It's chilly.  So you knew the music was going to be great, but not too cold.  You knew it was going to be dramatic music.  And I was on top of a hill.  So you gave the dramatic read.  And I had three burgers.  Uh-huh.  One, a classic, a Wendy's classic single, a classic double, and a classic triple.  Yeah.  But you're not Clint Eastwood.  Eat my burgers, punk.  Right.  Well, it was a choice I made.  It was a little cold out.  The moon was out.  You've got to ask yourself, is that a Wendy's classic or a Wendy's triple punk? 
[04:00:30]  Fatso.  Hey, I really sounded like I was fucking the burgers.  All right.  Well, we're listening to the voiceover demo from Bob Kelly.  Starbucks.  Oh.  Was there a Starbucks?  All right.  What do you think?  Do you have a Starbucks voice?  Dramatic, fun, regular guy.  What type of voice did he use on this one?  I'm going to go with a little bit of a faggy delivery.  Are you thinking like preppy?  Yeah.  Kind of regular guy, but a little more energetic and preppy-like? 
[04:01:00]  Yeah.  It's got to be energy because it's coffee, for God's sake.  Yeah.  He can't use this voice.  No, no, no.  And Starbucks is very young and hip.  Right.  So he's got to do the young hip guy.  Yeah.  That's what I'm thinking.  A little older than the Gamefly voice.  What do you think, Otto?  The Clint Eastwood, which sounded good.  Yeah?  You like that one?  What the fuck do I know?  Drink some Starbucks, you motherfucker.  All right.  Well, let's listen in and see how Bob Kelly does the Starbucks thing.  One moment for yourself. 
[04:01:30]  Starbucks coffee.  Take a break this holiday.  Oh.  That was kind of a mix of them, too.  How could you go to sleep during a coffee commercial?  That was dull, Bob.  I'll tell you what I was thinking.  I liked your Gamefly so far.  Let me tell you my choice on that one.  Uh-huh.  It was Christmas time.  It was Christmas.  Okay.  And at Christmas time, you're not all crazy.  Right.  But you want coffee.  Yeah, but you want...  Taking stock of your life, your family.  But this is more like you're taking a cup of coffee to sit down and relax.  Take a sip.  You know what I mean? 
[04:02:00]  Yeah.  And it's Christmas.  Relax.  Coffee to relax.  Relax.  Good idea.  Starbucks coffee to relax.  I've been drinking these espressos for hours now.  If I hadn't, I'd have been in a fucking coma.  Coma.  Right.  I don't know.  I'm not digging that dramatic.  Yeah, we're not feeling the Starbucks.  So far, I'm all with you with the fucking Gamefly fucking Xbox spot.  Yeah, yeah, fuck it.  I agree totally with you, kid.  Great.  All right.  He does an anti-drug commercial.  Anti-drug?  Yeah.  Right.  Let's hear what voice he picks for this one. 
[04:02:30]  It's 3 p.m.  Do you know where your kids are?  Times have changed.  Keeping kids off drugs means knowing what they're up to, even after school.  There are ways to do it.  Encourage them to stay active in the hours before you get home.  Kids involved in after school activities are less likely to use drugs.  Call 1-800-788-2899.  Parents.  The anti-drug.  Call 1-800-FUCK-A-SYNC.  Do you know where your kids are? 
[04:03:00]  In my trunk hole.  Yeah, exactly.  Hearing you doing that is a little creepy.  Do you know where your kids are?  No.  I'll send a note.  You send the money.  Yeah.  And no Amber Alert.  No Amber.  There's no Amber Alert.  You understand?  If I see Amber on any fucking highway going up the Mass Pike, I'm stabbing her in the throat.  Do you know where your kids are?  No.  Where?  Where are they?  In my trunk.  Do you know where?  You're kidding.  I was just talking to them. 
[04:03:30]  Now they're in Bob Kelly's trunk.  Yeah, well, you're the anti-drug whore.  I'm anti-drug.  This is Uncle Alcoholic.  The anti-drug.  Ugh.  I like it, though.  Very serious.  Who the hell?  That's that no joking around here voice.  Yeah, I got Harry Connick in the background.  Do-do-do-do.  That's a good one.  Why don't we try the clothing store one?  Oh, shit.  Is there another one?  One more.  Here it is.  70% off regular prices on the world's finest clothing, shoes, and accessories for men and 
[04:04:00]  women.  Tomorrow through Sunday.  Ah, that's kind of, you'll enjoy yourself here.  Yeah, that's like a sale end Sunday type of read.  That's exactly what it was.  Yeah, that's all it is.  Wow, what are you doing here when you're probably so busy with the offers?  With all your voice work.  I've only booked the Angry Baby.  And that wasn't on your audition?  On the real?  Yeah.  I didn't get that.  It wasn't a national thing.  It was just like a North Carolina health.  I didn't get it.  Oh, so you didn't get it through. 
[04:04:30]  Oh, you didn't get it.  I didn't get the, I got the gig.  You did?  I got it, but I didn't get a recording of it.  Damn, how could you not bring that?  The Angry Baby?  I want to hear your Angry Baby spot.  I should see if, maybe my, the guy might have.  The Healthcare?  Yeah, it's Healthcare.  Hey, you, come here.  Yeah, you over there.  Come here.  Look it.  I might get sick here.  You know, this milk might be wrong.  Your tip doesn't look too healthy.  And I might get sick and puke.  What happens then?  You got shitty healthcare, lady. 
[04:05:00]  Oh, Angry Baby.  No, I thought you said Angry Baby's all right.  I thought you said Angry Baby's all right.  You didn't need a drink.  No, I said fucking Angry Baby needs a drink.  All right, Angry Baby.  No, I thought you said Spider Angry Baby's okay.  All right.  No, you're fucking, you're fucking milk, yeah?  I said fucking I need a drink.  You're going to drink for him?  You're going to drink for him?  You're going to fucking drink for me?  You're fucking.  Give me a fucking drink.  You want to drink, Angry Baby?  Yeah, I want to fucking drink, you fucking cocksucker.  All right, all right, Angry Baby.  What is he fucking with?  Who's fucking with?  What the fuck?  I thought you said Spider, I'm okay, Angry Baby, I'm okay. 
[04:05:30]  You fucking dumb fucking, I'm a fucking Angry Baby.  I need a drink every fucking hour.  It needs to be warm.  Angry Baby, you're going to take that one?  Oh, yeah?  What the heck?  Yeah, fucking.  You fucking cocksucker.  Now get the drink, you fucking cunt.  Warm milk and a glass.  Put a nipple on the end of it, fuckface.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Bob Kelly is hosting The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  Okay, that's the end of The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  Thank fucking God.

And go to my Twitter.  What is it?  RKfans at fucking...  What is it?  What's my Twitter?  Oh, yeah.  At Robert Kelly fans.  I don't have to put Twitter slash.  Robert Kelly fans.  And that's because I couldn't get Robert Kelly because Sam's an asshole and fucking took it. 
[04:07:00]  And then I can't get it back.  So it had to be deleted.  And then it's gone forever.  So I had to get Robert Kelly fans.  Did he really take it?  Yeah, he fucking...  I don't want to get into it.  Makes me want to fucking rape his afro.  And then he deleted it and then now nobody can have it?  It's gone.  Yeah, it's gone.  What a bunch of cocksuckers.  Can I finish?  I didn't know.  Is this fucking high T?  What are we doing?  Ass.  Where I will be performing or whatever.  Just go to Robert...  It's RobertKelleyLive.com.

You always did make me...  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Hosted by Bob Kelly.  The Pirates.  Sirius 197.  XM 202.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I am E-Rock from The Opie and Anthony Show.  And we have a bonus segment here for you for Bob Kelly's day of hosting the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[04:08:00]  This was back in June when we were preparing for the 4th of July break.  Now, originally, we were going to do a show called The Best of Boobs, which involves porn stars and certain comics and guests of the show.  But that was the time when Tippi Tom had passed away, so we decided to do a tribute for that instead.  These are the voice tracks that we recorded with Bob Kelly, who was on tour with Dane Cook at the time.  And he was nice enough to call in to the studio for Sam and I to record. 
[04:08:30]  And Bob wasn't really happy with the way the whole session went.  Now, there's five tracks here, and that's it.  So enjoy.  Bonus Bob Kelly here on The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  Broadcasting The Worst of Opie and Anthony with Bob Kelly.  Hey, Bobby.  Hi, Bob.  Hi.  I think we just...  You miss me, Sam?  I miss you very much.  I wish you would come back.  You haven't grown any, like, body hair or facial hair since I left, have you?  No way. 
[04:09:00]  In fact, I've lost some.  Oh, good for you, you little twink.  I want to know why I'm getting the B team.  This is the A team right now.  This is like doing fucking The Carson Daly Show as opposed to fucking  let him in a fucking The Tonight Show.  Did I get fucking...  Is Eric going to speak or is it just Sam?  Oh, I didn't want to interrupt you.  Oh, no.  I was just fucking hoping.  All right.  What we're going to do, we're going to do quick segments with you for Worst of Vacation. 
[04:09:30]  Yeah, okay, Eric.  Fucking Mr. Serious Man.  Have you done radio before?  Are you okay with this?  Why is Eric so serious?  That's what I...  Why is he not even fucking quipping or...  Nothing.  ...fake laughing at anything I'm saying?  We're going to...  What we're going to do is record it and then play it back later as if it were...  We call it live to tape.  Yeah, I know what it is.  Oh, okay.  I've been in the business.  All right.  Sorry for joking.  Usually when they don't want you on live radio, they usually do this. 
[04:10:00]  That's about right.  They're just panicking that you're going to be boring and fucking...  It's going to stink anyway, so just...  You know what?  All right, let's get down to business.  Let's stop joking around and be serious for a second.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony Show.  I'm E-Rock.  And I'm primetime Sam Roberts from the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yes, and we have Bob Kelly on the phone joining us.  Hi, Bob.  Those three names together, you really need to say the worst of.  How did we only get a phoner with Bob Kelly?  Well, Bob's out touring with Dane Cook. 
[04:10:30]  Excuse me.  He's a busy man.  I don't like how fucking E-Rock puts a personality on once you hit the fucking big red button.  That's the same thing Opie always says.  He always takes on a new voice and personality when he's the host.  He fucking sucked off air.  He was like talking to a fucking doorman.  Yo, we're going to be doing...  And now you're all whipped up and fucking giddy?  Fuck you, E-Rock.  I don't really have that comfort level with you like everyone else has.  What are you talking about?  I've given you free tickets to any show you've ever wanted. 
[04:11:00]  I fucking adore you.  I treat you like a fucking fourth cousin.  Yeah.  Yep, and I added a T at the end of it.  Cousin.  You sound like Voss.  Bob's been very nice to me.  It's just I'm not in that world where I can just shoot insults back at him.  You have a little self-esteem.  It's sort of a form of respect for him.  It's your self-esteem.  All right.  Well, I take back what I said then.  Fantastic.  Good to see you, E-Rock.  E-Rock, what are we doing here?  Obviously, you're the businessman.  Well, we're on vacation, sort of, but this show is called...  Well, we're not. 
[04:11:30]  The show is.  Yes, but we're here, and the show is called Best of Boobs.  That's right.  The virus.  XF 202.  Series 197. </pre>
