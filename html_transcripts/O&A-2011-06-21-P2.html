<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

This After Opie and Anthony Live broadcast, hosted by Sam Roberts, primarily focused on the fallout from a previous Opie and Anthony show where the hosts, along with Jim, successfully dodged management.  The show's opening segments highlighted the upcoming return of Ron and Fez, although Fez was absent, replaced by "D-Man."  Preparations for the show, handled by Ron and Fez interns, were mentioned.

A significant portion of the broadcast centered on the impending appearance of Cameron Diaz, with discussion revolving around the talent bookers' typical reactions and Jim's unexplained departure before her arrival.  A major conflict between Eric (E-Rock) and Troy dominated a considerable chunk of the airtime. This involved a recurring push-up joke and a heated argument where Eric verbally overpowered Troy.  Listener calls provided various perspectives on the feud, with some supporting Eric and others siding with Troy. Eric's lifestyle, characterized by cartoon-watching and excessive eating, was contrasted with Troy's critiques.

The show featured a guest appearance by two "Mob Wives," Drita DiVanzo and Carla Facciolo, who discussed their show's popularity and fan interactions.  Following this segment, the hosts engaged in a lengthy debate on crafting an appropriate (and possibly innuendo-laden) question for Cameron Diaz.  The discussion included references to Steve Sterniolo and repeated mentions of Opie and Anthony branded condoms.  The broadcast concluded with promotional announcements for the upcoming Ron and Fez show featuring D-Man's debut.  Numerous listener calls throughout the show offered opinions on the ongoing Eric and Troy feud and other topics discussed.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  You didn't actually fall for that, did you?  Did you really think the story of the day was coming up next?  Here's the story of the day.  If you did, you really gotta start listening to this show.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  And I'm Sam Roberts.  That was a genius trick. A brilliant trick. 
[00:00:30]  On the part of Opie and Anthony to curtail management's advances.  And as I look down the hallway, it appears that Opie, Anthony, and Jim all managed to get out of here unscathed.  You mean by Snoozeville?  Snoozeville? No, it was Yawn Town.  Oh, Yawn Town.  Yawn Town.  Yeah, if you missed the beginning of the show today, you're gonna want to tune into the replay.  I know I say that a lot.  Generally, you should, because it's always good.  But today was especially good, quite memorable, especially for me. 
[00:01:00]  But yeah, Opie and Anthony got out of here.  Although, Roland, you did manage to get some guest pitches in.  Yep, yep.  With one and one.  I take it, and they ran away.  Oh, man.  This is a big day.  There's Ron and Fez interns in here.  And they're setting up the studio.  You know what that means.  He's doing the mime.  What's the mime?  Oh, not talking?  That means Ron and Fez are back.  Although, from what I hear, it's not Fez.  It's the D-Man.  Yeah, Fez took some time off, they said. 
[00:01:30]  But the D-Man's back.  The D-Man's back, which we're all excited about.  So we'll see how that turns out.  But another big development that happened during the commercial break was Cameron Diaz is coming up here today.  Right, Roland?  That is correct.  So, like we said before, whenever there's anybody famous in this place, every talent booker freaks out, whether it's their booking or not.  Yes.  Are you freaking yet?  Well, there's some requests for pitchers on the grass that...  You're not going to fill?  No. 
[00:02:00]  No.  So you're just going to move past those?  I'm looking to it.  That's what I do.  And how much looking do you do?  That's what I say.  I'm going to look into it.  I know.  That's where it ends.  Just you saying that.  You don't actually...  That's what I do.  I'm looking to it.  And then you go about the rest of your day as if nothing had happened.  Yeah.  So Cameron Diaz is coming up here to do a couple shows.  She's only going to be here for like 45 minutes or something.  Yeah.  But Jim decided not to wait around for her.  Yeah.  Really? 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  He went home.  He said, I'm not going to sit here for two hours and wait for Cameron Diaz.  I don't know if maybe he was worried that he wouldn't get the picture or if he felt humiliated.  I don't know.  But for whatever reason, he decided not to stick around.  Oh, wow.  He might come back.  Oh, you think he will, Eric?  I'm sure he thinks that now, but it'll just go in his head and he'll just go, ah, I'll go back up.  So he's not planning on leaving and coming back, but once he's...  She was on the cover of the New York Post today.  So she's a major A-lister, so that's... 
[00:03:00]  Well, I thought she was a major A-lister because of her movies, not because she was on the cover of the Post today.  I'm just saying, though, like, today she's on the cover.  I'm just saying that that's how big it's job.  I mean, she's got a movie coming out.  Yes, Bad Teacher.  It looks good.  Does it, Roland?  I do want to see Horrible Bosses, though.  Yeah, I mean, that I can understand, but Bad Teacher, that doesn't look good.  Roland, I knocked the wind out of you.  Eric, do you think Bad Teachers looks good?  Is that the Jason Segel movie? 
[00:03:30]  That is correct.  Yeah, with Cameron Diaz.  Yeah, I don't know.  Yeah.  Well, look, there's a reason Cameron Diaz is showing up to Sirius today.  I don't think so.  Hmm?  Is it Chick Flick?  Bad Teacher?  Sort of.  It's like a Chick Flick comic.  Yeah, but you said Black Swan was a Chick Flick.  You have no idea what you're talking about.  Yeah, I do.  No, the trailer makes it look like it's a Chick Flick.  Eric, how are you feeling after today?  I'm doing fine.  Oh, there's Troy.  You should...  Come on in.  Come on.  Oh, really, Sam?  Really?  Really?  Oh, here he comes.  He's right behind you.  He's going to...  He just kept walking. 
[00:04:00]  You know, Troy walked out with, like, 12 boxes of condoms.  Eric, he might be doing something for...  Or somebody.  That's why.  Doing something...  Doing what for who?  I don't know.  He takes care of Jim's show and...  Jim's not even here.  And promos and other stuff.  Why didn't he come in here?  I don't know.  Ask him.  Why didn't you come in there when Sam waved?  Oh, I didn't know what he was doing.  Oh.  He's coming.  What do you think I was doing?  A show.  Tell him to wear a medium t-shirt to get more blush through his system.  Oh, shit.  Sturney Olo.  Come in here.  Come in here.  Come in here.  Troy, you're yesterday's new.  You could stay in here, but Sturney Olo.  I thought he was doing his show still. 
[00:04:30]  You're done with your show?  Yeah.  You could come in here.  Oh, man, dude.  You missed it.  I gotta tell you something, Steve Sturney Olo.  You have become an ONA celebrity.  Overnight.  And it was because you came on this show last Friday, and you fought with so much passion.  You're a kingmaker.  Then you came on the big show, the Opie and Anthony show, yesterday, and you just destroyed Eric.  Sam, did you notice they all say Sturney Ola like I do?  Sturney Ola.  Yeah, now they all call you Sturney Ola.  But mispronunciation is better than I'm not knowing anything of my name. 
[00:05:00]  There was another major E-Rock argument today.  I heard bits and pieces.  Well, Opie told Eric, and by the way, I am going to...  Can I ask Cameron Diaz a one question?  That one might actually could be possible.  Is that like you're working on it?  Yeah.  Can Liam help me get a one question?  No, it's not his.  It'll be on the way out the door.  Oh, okay.  What are you looking for, Eric?  Eric, there he is.  Listen, you're not going to... 
[00:05:30]  Or 1G, we call him.  You're not going to want to wave at Eric.  It's a much more comfortable position not looking at E-Rock here.  Yeah, you're not going to want to look at him.  Especially when we're fighting.  Wait till I tell you this.  Okay.  Today, Opie once again brought up the push-ups.  20 push-ups, $100.  Then he said, 18 push-ups, $100.  And E-Rock said, no, because I don't need it.  And then Opie said, okay, if you can get up to 18, I will give you $10 a push-up. 
[00:06:00]  If you can get past 18, I will continue giving you $10.  Actually, he said 180.  Right, because 10 times 18.  And then $10 each additional one, right?  I wasn't good at math.  No, yeah.  So he offered him $180 plus 10 more for every other he could do.  How many would you go to?  I think I could honestly do...  I could do 30, I think.  But I could definitely do 20.  I know that.  It's funny that you say 30.  Because then Opie goes, I'm so sure that E-Rock is just not going to do this. 
[00:06:30]  Cerniolo.  He goes, I'm going to make this offer.  It's only going to be on the table for 15 seconds.  I will give E-Rock $1,000 if he comes in here and does 30 push-ups.  Eric took it, right?  He did it?  He did the 30 push-ups?  He got it.  He sat in his chair.  He said no, thank you.  Eric, a grand?  Eh.  Do you hear that?  He doesn't need it.  Do you realize you're coming off now as such a pompous dick face?  It's not even funny. 
[00:07:00]  Like, you scoff at $1,000?  No, I don't scoff.  $1,000 is a lot of money.  I just didn't need to do the push-ups.  He wipes his ass with thousands.  You didn't need to do that.  If there's anyone in this room who needs to do the push-ups.  You.  No, it didn't be you.  You were talking about Eric.  Yeah, it would be Eric.  And then Troy and Eric ended up getting into a big fight because, oh, we brought Troy in  and Troy started criticizing Eric's lifestyle, but, look, Troy comes in with a head of steam. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  He's angry.  He gets mad.  I don't blame him.  I like Eric.  This is the only thing that makes me mad about Eric is this.  Troy comes in with a head of steam and then sometimes when a curveball is thrown his way,  he gets lost in the field a little bit.  And what happened was he didn't realize that when you get Eric and you beat him and you  beat him and you beat him into a corner and you do it for an extended period of time,  eventually he explodes back.  He's the trench coat mafia.  Yes.  Eventually you get pushed too far and they come to school shooting.  But he actually, through Eric's words, made Troy look like a total asshole today. 
[00:08:00]  Eric verbally destroyed him.  He destroyed him.  One thing I heard for a half of a second, I heard for like a half a second, because you  came in while I was working and you said, hey, they want you to come in.  I was like, no, I can't.  You know, I got to actually do my job.  I told them that you said you would get fired.  I was like, I literally cannot leave my poster.  I need to do my job.  I said, he's on the show.  And they said, so?  Yeah, it means nothing that I'm on the show, by the way.  It's just literally my more important job would be actually just pushing the button  so the show stays on. 
[00:08:30]  Right.  However, the one thing I did hear was that E-Rock claimed that Troy was gay or whatever  for skateboarding.  But that's physical activity.  I never said he was gay.  No, no.  Eric killed him because Troy made fun of Eric for watching cartoons.  Then Eric told Troy, at least I don't hang out in the park skateboarding with a bunch  of 13-year-olds until an adult comes and tells us the park is closing.  He killed him. 
[00:09:00]  He destroyed him.  Troy, you have to admit, in hindsight, you got killed.  No, I don't think I got killed.  Carolina man said, Sam, today made me love E-Rock.  Troy is so lame.  I work out too, but E-Rock is the best.  Well, good.  I'm glad Eric's picking up some steam, and maybe this will encourage him to work out,  feel a little better about himself.  How many times has he said this before?  Exactly.  And then I go, no.  Why not while you're watching cartoons do push-ups and have a bowl of Twinkies at the 
[00:09:30]  bottom so every time you get down it's inspiring?  But you could be training.  You teach me your workout regimen.  Hang on a second, hang on a second, I'm going to back Sterniola up on this, because he lost  a lot of weight.  He put his mind to it, he's like, you know what, I'm so tired of saying I have bitch tits,  I'm so tired of saying I'm a fat fuck, and he went and he did it.  But Troy, Eric is doing what he's doing, and he still made you look like a dickhead today, 
[00:10:00]  so why would he change, like, why would he make any effort that's hard to do, like a  push-up, that's hard to do a push-up sometimes, when he could sit on the couch, enjoy a Coke  float, watch the real Ghostbusters.  Dude, that is my dream.  Coke floats?  Yeah, he loves Coke floats, Eric.  Is that vanilla ice cream and soda?  You bet you're sweet tits.  See, here's the thing.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Don't drink those.  Yes, you do.  He's sitting there drinking Coke floats, watching cartoons, looking at pictures of his house 
[00:10:30]  in Florida, and not doing physical activity, and he can still come in here, and have the  whole crowd on his side, and make you look like a dick for even bringing any of this up.  Right.  Why would he go by your guidance when he won the War of Words?  Right.  Eric, you did win the War of Words, correct?  He did.  I believe so.  You killed him.  Yeah, good point.  Just continue being a fat fuck, then.  Oh, no!  Jesus!  Jesus!  Jesus!  Jesus!  Yeah, I mean, who cares?  I mean, sit around and do nothing, and, you know, just deteriorate. 
[00:11:00]  Just deteriorate.  Oh, Eric, did you have a comeback?  I just love how Troy spends his day, and he eats at him, that he's so annoyed and angry  at me, but I go home, and I put on a cartoon, I never think about Troy until I see him in  the morning and go, oh, good morning, Troy.  Your laziness comes into this show.  You know what I think?  It comes into, it's a lifestyle thing.  I think, and I was...  I keep digging up shit to try to tie all this together.  It's true.  You know it.  All right, I was on Troy's side while we were doing this on the air, because that was a little  funner, until Eric came back at Troy, then I decided to be on Eric's side. 
[00:11:30]  The thing is, Eric goes home, and he lives like a Kingwood in the 1700s.  Oh, actually...  He sits on his throne, he eats, he is merry, he falls asleep sometimes, he does what he wants.  Is he?  I mean, if you're...  Eric, are you happy?  I'm fine.  Hold on a second.  Hang on a second.  Hang on one, please.  If you are shoveling food constantly in your mouth, you don't think that that is covering  up for something deeper?  Let me see what he did.  I love how Troy thinks I eat non-stop every minute of the day. 
[00:12:00]  I mean, you're not losing weight.  Let me see what he did.  You're not going down.  Since we've been working together here in this building, you have gotten bigger.  So, I mean, what's there not to think that you're not continuing to constantly consume?  It's not bigger.  It's regal.  Too busy eating.  It's a regal sense.  Sam, one time, Eric and I, we each got the big sub sandwiches with delicious sides.  We ate, and I sat on a different couch.  He sat on a different couch.  We're watching TV, and you both passed out. 
[00:12:30]  It was awesome.  It was like the best day ever.  People are calling in, even though I don't take phone calls, because they're impassioned  about this.  Vita subs.  You on line one.  Who screens at home?  Yeah, I just have a question for Eric.  It's like the phone show.  Yeah.  Eric, you know there isn't going to be Medicare for our age group.  I mean, are you thinking long-term on this?  I mean, you know that Fez is going to be dead in the year.  I don't know anything about Fez, but he just...  Eric, are you worried about the health issues?  To a degree. 
[00:13:00]  No, you're not.  You just shovel things down your greedy little snout all day.  Oh, really?  To what degree?  Yeah, I see it.  Okay, because you're sitting at your desk not doing any work all day.  Ouch.  You're lucky I'm not even going to say what I want to say right now.  I'm not going to say it.  Why not?  I'm not going to say it, because I actually like you, Rock.  It's an open forum.  Say it.  We're just in here for the push-ups.  Well, then you don't have anything to say.  Then I got...  It's like the phone show.  Good one.  Eric, uh...  Oh, you, Rock, I hate you so much right now.  Are you not...  It's doing you all like, come down.  Oh, wait.  Phil in Rochester, is Troy pointing out falls to cover up his insecurities? 
[00:13:30]  No, Troy's not...  Oh, shit!  He's right!  Are you insecure?  I mean, what are my insecurities?  I'll talk about anything that I...  Maybe you don't have as happy a lifestyle as you think you do.  I'm fairly happy.  I mean, who is completely happy?  You know what I mean?  Apparently.  But, you know, you have ways of dealing with depression.  You have ways of dealing with things.  I'll tell you this.  I've seen you upset in the workplace more than I've seen Eric upset in the workplace. 
[00:14:00]  Eric's lazier than you, but I've seen you upset more times than I've seen Eric upset.  Eric, is that true?  Is that fair?  I think that's fair.  Okay.  But I've turned a new leaf.  You've told me...  And I'll tell you this.  In the two years that we've been in this building, about every three weeks you've told me you've turned a new leaf.  The past two months, haven't I been a completely different person?  There's been a lot of new leafs.  There's been a lot of leaves.  Answer my question.  And most of the time he's mad at that guy over there.  No!  No!  Usually he's mad at you, Eric.  He gets, like, disgusted and just tizzies. 
[00:14:30]  When you walk away, you see him shaking.  I'm like, what's wrong?  He's just...  Nagle.  I just...  I can't take it.  I can't take it.  He's just so disgusted.  He gets mad at Eric.  Eric, can I ask you one simple question?  Go ahead.  This is it.  All right?  Why don't you just come in here, drop down while O&A are here, do the push-ups, and just  shut everyone the fuck up.  Because he can't do it.  Shut everyone the fuck up.  Because I don't need to.  You can't do them.  No, you need to do push-ups.  I've done...  You just got tons of push-ups.  All right.  Since you're new to this whole world of talk, I'll tell you.  I've been doing this show for seven years, and I've done a million things that they've 
[00:15:00]  asked me for.  They said, just do it.  It'll shut everybody up.  And I've done that.  And you know what?  It doesn't shut them up, because then the next thing comes around.  We got a couple of feedbacks.  Because here's what happens.  Wait, wait, wait.  We got a couple of feedbacks.  One is saying, Peter is asking if E-Rock watches Game of Scones on HBO.  And Puddle of Aids wanted to make sure that everybody realizes, has anyone realized that  you don't need to pick a side?  E-Rock and Troy are both hateable douchebags. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  Fair enough.  So that's something good.  Well, read the last line of that feedback, Sam.  Okay.  Primetime Sam Roberts rules.  I was going to leave that out.  Fair enough.  Oh, wait.  And Freddie from Jamaica State, big fat E-Rock has become a blob of boredom.  Troy fucks other guys' chicks at will.  That's true.  Fair statement?  Fair enough.  Definitely fair.  Fair enough.  No, but see, the reason why Eric doesn't want to come in.  He took 12 boxes of condoms.  I just took two, but there's 40 in each one.  I got cars too. 
[00:16:00]  Sternie O.O., closing comments.  I just think E-Rock should do the fucking push-ups, and then not even to shut them up.  All right, I understand.  You're going to be made fun of for being horrific looking forever on this show.  But I think that you should just do it, get the money, and give it to obviously Troy  and Sam, who are your friends, and could use the money.  Eric, would you do that?  That'd be huge.  Nah.  You won't even do it to help people.  We took Sam to lunch.  Yeah, but well, I mean, you could still give me some cash.  And did you eat?  Yeah, I ate.  Surprise.  That's what you do at lunch.  1 p.m. east.  Yeah, make sure you tune in to the phone show today and call in. 
[00:16:30]  Sternie O.O. is just sad because he used to eat.  He doesn't eat anymore.  He lost a lot of weight, man.  You can't diss him because he doesn't look happy.  He looks great.  He's fucking miserable.  Yeah, you guys are the ones yelling.  Eric is kind of a little more cool, calm, and collective.  And you and Sternie O.O. are the ones who are getting hot under the collar.  Sandra and Lynch, Eric and I were happy with their beef goulash.  I saw you guys.  I've never seen two happier little guys in my life.  Beef goulash, eh?  You bet you're sweet-ass in him.  Yeah, that's what I was going to say.  It's so good.  When you said Eric eats salads around us, I was going to say on the air that beef goulash is not considered a salad. 
[00:17:00]  No, believe me, I smell the sandwiches.  It's so funny how none of that comes up.  The sandwiches in there, when him and Roland go out.  That's mostly Roland's sandwiches that you smell.  I see you in there.  I see you in there.  I have sandwiches, but they don't smell like Roland's does.  It's vinegar and hot sauce.  Bubba in Texas, I was just about to go to you.  You bet your sweet ass.  He literally hung up as I was talking to him.  He wanted to say that it's become obvious that Troy wants Iraq's cock. 
[00:17:30]  Now, Iraq, I'll go to you first.  Do you feel that's the case?  Well, let's follow the clues here.  Wasn't there something the other day where Troy was overly complimented to Opie?  Oh, yeah.  It got really uncomfortable.  It got really weird.  He's like, you look really great, man.  It's like, you're doing good.  You're taking me out of context.  And then all of a sudden you come in here, you know, you could look so much better.  I'm really concerned about you.  Like, you have man crushers on all of us.  This is like a gay thing, you think, Eric? 
[00:18:00]  I don't think it's a gay thing, but it's borderline.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  There's not a gay bone in this body.  Trust me when I tell you.  Club Soda Kenny just texted me.  He wants to correct everybody.  He said, Eric does do push-ups on top of his wife.  Oh, shit.  And then he wrote something that's even more vulgar that I won't share out of respect.  You should say it.  Out of respect for Eric's wife, I won't say it.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Well, in all fairness, Club Soda Kenny on Facebook, so. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, I mean, let that be that.  People are calling, look, it says, Sam, leave Iraq alone, you bitch.  I haven't said anything bad about Iraq.  Yeah, you're just, well, earlier you were.  Well, you were going back and forth.  Well, I had to keep everything going.  Sam was a little bitch when he was ordering food.  We ordered a sandwich.  I was, who, okay, Troy, let me tell you this, and Eric, you can witness this.  Okay.  I was a little bitch.  We go and get food.  I got buffalo chicken fingers.  I couldn't decide onion rings or fries, so I ordered both. 
[00:19:00]  Good.  It's on Iraq.  Yeah.  And then I ordered water, okay, free.  Roland grabs the waiter halfway through the meal and says, excuse me, waiter, could you  bring out a Coca-Cola for my friend here?  He's very thirsty.  So Roland is now adding stuff to Iraq's bill, not me.  Yeah.  And Eric probably didn't care.  He's like, whatever, I got the endless, endless amounts of money in the bank.  Yeah, he didn't see the difference in any of it at all because, like I said, he paid  $110 for lunch last week. 
[00:19:30]  He's not even doing the push-ups for $1,000.  Yeah.  It's not like he needs to do.  It means nothing to him.  I think Troy misses the lunch club.  Of course.  Do you miss the lunch club?  Well, of course.  Eric would buy lunch.  Who doesn't appreciate that?  I have to tell you something.  Obviously you.  Well, hey, you bring it back.  I'm there.  Bo in Cleveland, the only push-ups E-Rock does, can be found in the grocery's freezer section.  Flintstones push-ups.  Yes.  But I got to tell you, the longer you, I'm leaving, I'm looking at feedback and the phones  and stuff, the longer you talk, Troy, the less support you get. 
[00:20:00]  I could care less.  I could care less.  Wow.  I mean, whatever.  What, are you pulling an angle?  No.  I could care less.  It's his life.  He can live it any way he wants.  Troy, turn to your left.  That's the lunch that Sam got.  Oh, it looks quite delicious.  Thank you.  And that was also, that was also dinner.  Yeah.  Couldn't finish it all.  Yeah.  Couldn't finish it all.  But I said no dessert because I was a bit full.  Yeah.  You did look at a dessert menu, though.  You wanted dessert. 
[00:20:30]  Listen, we got to take a break, Eric?  Yeah, we got a break.  They didn't take many breaks on Opie and Anthony's show today, but stay tuned.  After Opie and Anthony Live will continue, today is the return, not the return, the  debut of the D-Man on Ron and Fez.  And I got to tell you, I was looking at Twitter and looking at everything that was 202 Friends  were retweeting last night, and this D-Man has everybody in a tizzy.  I mean, to say people are excited about this mysterious D-Man debuting would be an understatement. 
[00:21:00]  I mean, they were saying, go to 202 Friends on Twitter and see for yourself because they  didn't stop all night long.  We'll be right back with more After Opie and Anthony Live.  The ONA show continues, sort of, next.  This is After Opie and Anthony Live on the Virus Sirius XM.  Oh my goodness.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live. 
[00:21:30]  We got more guests.  Why do you have nothing in there?  Really?  Come on in, ladies.  What's up?  The mob wives are back.  Make yourselves comfortable.  What brings you back to Sirius XM?  I like it over here.  You're just coming to hang out?  I'm coming to just hang out.  These things are huge.  I guess because our mob wife season finale is coming Sunday, so.  How did the season go?  It was very stressful. 
[00:22:00]  Was it stressful?  For me, it was.  Now, you two, first, you want to introduce yourselves so we know, because we had all four  of you the last time.  Right.  So you want to introduce yourselves so everybody knows who you are?  I'm Drita DiVanzo from Mob Wives.  I'm Carla Fessiola from Mob Wives.  So you two came in with everybody when this whole thing was starting.  It became a popular show.  Are you used to getting recognized?  Because now you're on the side of a bus.  You're on Billboard.  No, no.  Everybody recognizes us.  Yeah.  Is that something that's been tough to get used to? 
[00:22:30]  Or did you kind of have that before?  No, we weren't stopped and screamed.  Oh, my God.  Take a picture.  It's the Mob Wives.  Yeah.  Come running.  No, we weren't used to that.  Of course not.  So what's it like now?  It's, it's, it's, I find it funny.  You know, I mean, I think it's cool and everything, but some people could get like, I mean, they'll  chase you around a block if they have to get you.  Really?  I just think, yeah, I think it's a little crazy because they call you by your name because  they, listen, they could, they hang out with you every Sunday night.  They feel like they know you. 
[00:23:00]  They feel like they know you.  And the way they approach me, I start bugging out.  I'm like, I'm sorry I don't remember your name.  Like, I start thinking that I really am supposed to know them.  Because they know you.  Right.  They're like, Drina, what's up?  I'm like, shit, I don't know this kid's name.  Well, there are people like Opie, who usually sits here.  Right.  I mean, now it's after 10 o'clock.  That's why you're stuck with me.  But he's here before me.  He has always said that he's got a psychological problem, I would call it, where he thinks  that when he sees people that are on TV, not only does he know them, but they should know  him. 
[00:23:30]  That's awesome.  That's funny.  Did you ever have any conversation where somebody feels like they're more, like, do you owe  them something?  Um, I've had, I've had a couple of crazies like that.  I just like, they scream your name out, like, like somebody, you know, is calling them and  you turn around and you don't know this person from a hole in the wall.  They're like, what's up?  What are you doing?  I'm like, oh, hi.  Like, you know, you don't know.  Do they shout at you on a first name basis?  First name basis.  Well, that's what I'm saying.  That's why it took me a while to understand like this because of the show they're calling 
[00:24:00]  me.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  And I'm like, oh, because they're like, Trina, what's up?  How's Aaliyah?  How's Giselle?  I'm like, what?  You know, I'm like, oh boy.  I'm like, you know, they talk to you like they know you.  So with all the attention that you're getting, how do you handle that now there's people criticizing  you that you didn't know them from a hole in the wall, you know, a few weeks ago.  And now all of a sudden they're saying negative things about you, whether it's on Twitter,  whether it's a newspaper article.  Did you read, um, are we allowed to curse?  Yes.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:24:30]  Did you read, did you read my bio on Twitter?  Uh-uh.  My bio says, if you don't like me, take a seat with the rest of the bitches waiting  for me to give a fuck.  And that's exactly my answer to what you did.  You don't care about any of it?  No.  The negative stuff?  You're not, listen, you're not going to parent my child, pay my bills, take care of me.  You're not doing anything in my life for me.  I don't care what you have to say.  Period.  Good for you.  That's a message.  Look, they're already rushing you out of here.  This is very impromptu, but when is the season finale?  Next Sunday. 
[00:25:00]  Season finale.  Next Sunday, not this Sunday.  VH1.  This Sunday.  This Sunday.  This Sunday.  Okay.  Sorry.  This Sunday.  8 o'clock, VH1.  8 p.m. VH1.  The Mob Wives.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  And it's, by the way, for everybody asking at home, it's the two good-looking Mob Wives.  We just, uh, we roam around the hallways over here.  All right.  Well, stop by if you've got more time later.  I'll be here.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I don't know how that happened.  There was another one of those things where E-Rock just goes, what happened, Roland?  What's your one question that has to submit?  For Cameron Diaz? 
[00:25:30]  Um, I don't know.  Smells good, right?  Yeah, those were the two good-looking Mob Wives.  There's the...  It's the one with Kenny Light.  Yeah.  I mean, there's the two more gruff, let's say, Mob Wives.  And then there's the two good-looking ones.  We got blessed today with the presence of the two good-looking Mob Wives.  I mean, I don't know why we...  They're in the hallway, though.  I feel like if there's people in the hallway...  It's fair game.  Let's bring them in.  Whether it's Steve Sterniolo or whether it's the Mob Wives.  That's the way we run things.  One question for Cameron Diaz.  Troy, what do you think my one question for Cameron Diaz should be? 
[00:26:00]  Um...  Because I don't want to do another food question.  It's always...  That's an easy one.  Clothing is a little much...  Does she watch Mob Wives?  No, because I already asked Christian Slater if he watches Top Chef.  What about anything with...  What's on your iPod or iTunes?  No, because I asked Jesse Spano if you have an iPod.  That's a funny question.  Should open up the phone lines.  See what people say.  But they'll all be bad ideas.  I don't want to do...  I want to try to think of something right now. 
[00:26:30]  Eric, what do you think?  Doesn't have to be a well-thought-out question.  Just some kind of concept.  Help me out with this.  What's her favorite cartoon?  Who's her favorite Beatle?  Those are somewhat interesting questions.  That's the problem.  You have to focus...  Sticker automatic.  Um...  How about this?  Do you drive a car with a manual transmission?  That's the question.  Well, then you just take mine and just... 
[00:27:00]  But I made it better.  He made it better, though, Ron.  That's a better question, right?  He made it a little bit better.  What'd you say?  And make sure that they realize that there is no penis double entendre in that question.  That's not the purpose of it.  Because if they think that there's a joke hidden in the question, the bit doesn't work at all.  Mask or son of mask?  Well, that's a funny question.  That's like a joke question.  You understand?  So what was the question again?  Do you drive an automatic transmission car?  Okay.  Is your car an automatic transmission?  That's the better wording of it. 
[00:27:30]  You going to submit that?  No.  Why not?  Because you just pissed me off.  So you get no questions.  Everybody...  The phone lines just exploded.  But you get no questions because you upset me.  Why did I upset you?  So try next time.  See what they say.  They might have funny questions.  You see the mob wives in here?  They're hot.  Yeah.  Especially...  I like the...  Which do you like better?  Either one.  I like the blonde redhead.  You do, Eric?  Yeah.  All right.  So me and you can get along.  All right.  Line one.  What do you think I should ask?  Bad phone. 
[00:28:00]  Line two.  What do you think I should ask?  How many push-ups can you do?  That's a good question.  Line three.  Line four.  What do you think I should ask?  You see what I mean about these people?  I'm just not going to take any more.  Okay.  One more.  You're on the air.  What do you think I should ask?  Popcorn on his butter, Alex Padrix.  See?  This is what I mean, Troy.  I told you it was a bad idea.  It was a bad idea.  I'm sorry.  This is why phone radio is like, what?  Because these guys don't know what they're doing. 
[00:28:30]  So is your car an automatic transmission?  Transmission, yeah.  I think you could have thought of a better one.  You're usually good with them.  That's a good question.  That's not as strong as some of your other ones.  All right.  We'll wait until you hear it when it's recorded, and then we produce it, and then you'll be thinking  differently.  All right.  Look, the phones are all lit up.  Yeah.  There you go.  You've got a whole bank full of people that have good ideas.  No, they don't.  They all have ideas.  None of them are good.  I'm sticking to the question, Roland.  We're not even...  Who's your favorite Beatle?  That's not a good one.  Why?  Because that's interesting.  It's Paul.  Why is it Paul?  Why is it interesting? 
[00:29:00]  You're asking because you actually care.  Yeah.  That defeats the whole purpose.  Well, I'd like to know.  Well, then ask it yourself.  Think of your own bit.  I don't do the one question bit.  Here's a question Troy wants to know the answer to.  Nobody wants to hear it.  I think it's George.  I think it's George.  Shut up.  Dumb question.  I like you, Sam's.  Thank you, Roland.  Thank you so much.  I'd say angry.  Look, Troy.  Yeah.  Plug your DJing gig and then get the fuck out of the studio because people are turning  on you, as I said.  And I can't have these negative forces in my studio.  So plug the DJing gig and then you can't talk anymore for the rest of the day. 
[00:29:30]  On the air.  6-7-5 bar tonight in the West Village.  And then Friday, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.  The Tally Ho.  Come out.  Have a good time.  And Troy Kwan on Facebook and Twitter.  That's where all the dates are.  And send your favorite juices to Troy Kwan's Facebook.  And yeah, I mean, if you guys have a major problem with the way Troy, what is, oh my  God, this is so exciting.  You can see Troy live when he's doing the thing at 6-7-5 club tonight.  Yeah, you got to go, Troy.  You can't talk anymore. 
[00:30:00]  You have to go.  This is very exciting, though, because.  That was a major question now.  Okay.  Thank you very much, Roland.  The studio transition is finally happening.  What's Travis?  Is he coming in here?  What do you have to, what's going on, Travis?  Did you hear the mob wives?  Yeah, I sure did.  I see people walking and I say, well, why aren't they in here?  And sometimes they end up coming in here.  They're here every day.  I know.  They're just always here.  I had a question, a question idea for Cameron Diaz. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, okay, we can grab Roland.  We have time.  What's the question?  What's your favorite internet browser?  No, because that's what I asked.  Oh, did you?  I asked Max Weinberg, what's your favorite search engine?  Oh, all right.  It's too similar, Google or Bing.  No, I understand.  I like these, though.  These are fun.  It has everything going in the back there.  It's pretty good.  Yeah?  Yeah, we're getting some work done.  Danny was pissed off, too, that Eric wouldn't do the push-ups.  Sure.  Everybody was.  Everyone is.  Oh, man, look how exciting this is.  There's Ron and Fez interns.  Mark Zito's walking around for the first.  Those are Opie and Anthony condoms. 
[00:31:00]  You can't touch those.  What did you say?  I said he's never seen them.  He's never seen them?  You're a virgin?  Or you just go unprotected raw dog every time?  Raw dog every time.  Nice, I like that.  Spread it around, Mark Zito.  Spread it around.  The virus.  So this is big for Ron and Fez.  This is a big return to 11 o'clock, right?  Yeah.  And the D-Man is coming today?  I don't know.  I haven't seen him.  I've heard.  Yeah, because I didn't know a lot about the D-Man, but then I started looking on Twitter.  And it was exploding last night.  Yeah, it still is.  Travis, you've got to see 202 Friends if you haven't yet. 
[00:31:30]  I haven't checked it out, but I'm very excited for the D-Man.  Because if you thought Chuck Norris facts were a hot thing on the internet for a while,  or Charlie Sheen winning t-shirts were a big thing, wait until the D-Man rolls through  here like a tornado.  Is that right at 11 o'clock?  I believe so.  I think that's the plan.  Unless D-Man shows up late.  And sometimes he does.  That's up to him.  D-Man shows up when he wants.  Exactly.  That's his prerogative.  You know?  But Fez won't be here?  Not supposed to be. 
[00:32:00]  He's not supposed to be.  D-Man is taking his place.  I like that.  Eric, what do you know about the situation?  I know nothing about the D-Man, but I could not be more excited.  Yeah.  Oh, that's not one of our guys walking up the hallway, is it?  No.  I wonder if they have any interesting to say.  I would love to hear if Roland is going to get this one question thing done.  You want me to go find him?  Yeah.  Why not?  For the bit.  For the bit.  How's Bobo doing today?  Have you called him?  No, we're waiting for you.  Oh, thank you. 
[00:32:30]  I appreciate that.  I would play a bit, but we don't have time.  What were you going to say, Mark Zito?  Oh, you want the phone mouse?  Yeah, we're not going to go to any of these dumb calls anymore.  Okay.  Your intern asked already, but I told him we might.  And we actually did go to a couple calls.  And then what happened was they weren't good calls, so we had to hang up.  What do you think of the phone show?  Yeah, what do you think of the phone show?  Oh, Roland.  What's going on?  Do you have another question?  She won't have an automatic transmission.  That was a pass.  Okay.  Do we know why it was a pass? 
[00:33:00]  I do not.  They said, do you have another question?  Yes, I have another question.  Of course I do.  Suck it!  Oh, you got me.  All right.  You did get me that time.  Roland, you use your power for evil, because people assume.  Assume that because it's your business, you're the one who knows the answer.  I do.  That you're telling the truth.  There's nothing better, because Jim prides himself on not being gotten.  Yeah.  But Roland, you get Jim every single time, because he's so wrapped up in whatever guest is coming  in picture.  The minute you say, he's running two hours late, you're like, really? 
[00:33:30]  No!  Or the coffee was the best one.  Oh, yeah.  When you threw an empty cup of coffee on his lap, and he almost hit the ceiling and jumped  so high, his chair ended up hitting the back of the door in the studio.  Yeah.  Oh, my gosh.  No.  No.  They're going to, when she comes, they're going to propose it to her.  Good.  And she's coming around noontime?  Um, yeah, soon.  Are we going to be able to go to the meeting? 
[00:34:00]  For what?  So we get to sleep?  How dare you, Roland?  The meeting is a constructive use.  Oh, Sam, do you have two seconds?  Well, you know you're on the air, right?  You forget these things.  Oof.  No, Zito, I won't do that.  Did you see what happened there, Eric?  Somebody, uh, somebody got a joke over, and so he got all excited and forgot that he  was being broadcast right.  Well, Zito keeps writing stuff on paper and pushing it in front of Roland.  I totally forgot for a minute.  Mark Zito, are those your notes?  I still have, I have, uh, stand-up comedy audio from Mark Zito. 
[00:34:30]  I never got a chance to pitch it to Ron, because I haven't seen Ron since Jury Duty,  really.  Ooh.  But I do have the audio, you know that.  I haven't listened to it, but I've got it.  So if any of you want to hear it, Eric, we're out early today, right?  I don't have time to play a bit, do I?  Uh, no, you got about three minutes.  Yeah, so, I mean, what am I going to do?  Listen, uh, hats off, by the way, to Opie and Anthony for getting out of here.  Opie and Anthony were genuinely trying to think of a plan, both on the air and off the 
[00:35:00]  air, uh, to get out of here without the bosses catching them, and they did it.  I mean, to those of you who were tuned in at the beginning of After Opie and Anthony Live,  uh, you know that you were expecting the story of the day.  Well, we don't have it for you, because Opie and Anthony were lying about that.  Unfortunately.  That's right.  Eric, do you feel like, uh, days like today, do you care what the audience opinion of you  is?  Uh, honestly. 
[00:35:30]  It's okay if you do.  Yes and no.  Yeah, you'd rather have positive feedback than negative feedback.  Well, I'm sure anybody would rather have that.  Yeah, I mean, I would.  I don't, I mean, I don't know what the positive feedback is like, generally speaking, but it  seems better than all the negative feedback.  Um, do you feel like days like today, you turn a corner that, because it seems like when  you get into these arguments, the longer they go, like I told Troy, went before I kicked him  out of here, the more they go in favor of you.  Well, this is like such a hot button issue for Troy and Steve Sterniolo, but they just want, 
[00:36:00]  they just want to vent, you know, they, they sit there and go, I'm mad and this is why.  Okay.  What else?  Uh, nothing.  So your strategy is to just let them go and just be completely nonchalant about it.  Let them say what they have to say.  They're the ones who are upset.  They're the ones that can't get through their day and be happy.  Because you started the argument in a position of you're a spoiled rich kid who gets handed 
[00:36:30]  everything and...  Well, some of that comes from you.  No, it doesn't come from me.  Oh, really?  And somehow...  Where did I grow up, Sam?  Uh, Florida, Miami Beach.  No, that is not true.  I, I, I would check birth certificates.  But somehow, you end up the working class hero every time.  I don't know.  The blue collar guys get behind you no matter what corner they pin you in.  I'm just trying to be me.  You're just trying to get by.  Is that, is that right?  You're just trying to be you.  I'm just being me.  Watch a couple cartoons.  Enjoying what I'm doing. 
[00:37:00]  Everyone else has a problem with it.  Roland?  Why are you shaking?  You're not going to get me again.  It doesn't work twice.  Yeah.  He's coming in here.  He's trying to figure out if he ramps up.  No.  No, that's fine.  We'll talk after.  Oh, we're going to have to have a private conversation?  I just need two seconds every time.  Okay.  Listen.  You're going to need a lot more than two seconds when you get, when you get to hear  the D-Man for the first time.  Oh, did you hear about July 15th?  What?  Blake Shelton's new album comes out.  Who?  Who cares?  He's talking about Blake Shelton again.  Oh, he blurred it together.  I couldn't hear it. 
[00:37:30]  He's talking about Blake Shelton.  Oh.  Listen.  The Voice is on tonight.  Ron and Fez are coming up.  Only two weeks left.  Forget Ron and Fez.  Everybody's watching it.  Everybody's watching it.  It doesn't make any sense.  They have different rules every week.  It's awesome.  It's a waste of time.  It's not.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  The D-Man makes his debut today.  That he does.  Highly anticipated.  I don't know if he'll come out of an egg, if he'll drop from the ceiling.  I don't know what kind of entrance he'll make, but what I do know is it will be memorable,  and I would recommend that you stay tuned for that. 
[00:38:00]  Ron and Fez return live next.  I'll throw The Voice tonight and tomorrow.  Opie and Anthony and After Opie and Anthony Live will be back tomorrow morning, and for  everything else, have a great day.  This has been After Opie and Anthony Live.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O&A show on Facebook at facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony, and catch Opie and  Anthony live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern.
